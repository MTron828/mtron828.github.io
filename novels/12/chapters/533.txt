Was she trying to rebel?

“Zhao shuning walked to Wu Mei’s side. “Sister-in-law, MOM is calling you.” ”

“Wu Mei nodded, greeted ye Shu, and walked over. ”

“Seeing Wu Mei walk over, Zhao shuning and Feng Qianhua walked to the other side, leaving the space for Old Lady Lin and Wu Mei. ”

“”Mom, did you call me for something?” ”

“Madam Lin’s expression was a little ugly. “Boss, in my heart, you’ve always been sensible! But today, you’ve really disappointed me!” ”

“Wu Mei was stunned. “Mom, What’s Wrong?” ”

“”What’s wrong with me?”Madam Lin suppressed her anger. “You still have the nerve to ask me what’s wrong! Let me ask you, what did you call ye Shu just now?” ”

“”Fifth sister-in-law,”Wu Mei answered. ” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Old Mrs. Lin was so angry that she almost vomited blood. “Wu Mei! You have to figure out who is your fifth sister-in-law!”

“Wu Mei was not a fool. She instantly understood what old Mrs. Lin meant, she smiled and said, “Mom, I know that you have always liked Qianhua and have treated her as your future daughter-in-law. “But you don’t have the final say in such matters. You have to see what Jin City wants. Jin city is already forty years old this year, and he knows what he wants. He and his fifth sister-in-law have missed each other for nineteen years. For the rest of their lives, please fulfill their wishes.” ”

“At this point, Wu Mei paused for a moment, then she continued, “Besides, not only is my fifth sister-in-law not as bad as the rumors say, she is actually very outstanding. She knows English, knows finance, and has her own business knowledge. Such a good woman can only be met by chance, but not by chance. Jin city is lucky to have met her again, and the two of them can be together again!” ”

“”And the eldest niece, Mom. Take a good look at the eldest niece. She’s your only granddaughter. Not only is she beautiful, but she also plays the world’s most difficult piano piece and speaks Arabic. “Do you think there’s a second person like the eldest niece in our circle? “It’s your fortune to have such a granddaughter. I can guarantee that half of the old ladies in the capital would envy you for having such an outstanding granddaughter.” ”

“Hearing this, Old Lady Lin’s face turned pale. ”

She could not contain her anger.

“”Wu Mei! You’re here to anger me on purpose, aren’t you? It’s fine if that uneducated girl doesn’t embarrass me, but who would envy me? There’s more! Where did you get the idea that Jin City is fortunate to be together with ye Shu! It’s clearly that b * Tch Ye Shu who has climbed up to our Lin Family!” ”

“Old Mrs. Lin continued, “Wu Mei, I think you’re up to no good! Have you been hating this old woman for a long time? Do You Wish For me to die early?” ”

“Wu Mei was afraid that the other guests would find out that old Mrs. Lin was acting strangely, she lowered her voice and said, “Mom, I didn’t mean that! “You’ve really misunderstood fifth sister-in-law. It’s useless for me to say anything now. After you spend a few days with fifth sister-in-law, you’ll know that she’s really a rare and good woman. She definitely won’t be inferior to Qianhua!” ”

“Wu Mei really admired ye Shu, and she was also very envious of Ye Shu. ”

“Although she had suffered for 19 years, it was finally a blessing in disguise. Not only did she have a husband who loved her, but she also had an excellent pair of twins. ”

This mother-in-law of hers had been a snob all her life.

“Back then, she had concealed her family background and started dating Lin Qingfan. After Old Lady Lin found out about it, Old Lady Lin actually used a cheque of 100,000 yuan to dismiss her. After she found out that she was the daughter of the Wu family, she immediately changed her face, she tried to curry favor with her. ”

“If Wu Mei didn’t admire Lin Qingfan’s character and ability, she wouldn’t have married him no matter what. ”

Reality proved that Lin Qingfan didn’t disappoint him.

“Lin Qingfan’s ability was on par with Lin Jin city. Over the years, he had developed the family business very well. Out of the five brothers of the Lin family, apart from Lin Qingxuan who had lived abroad for a long time, the rest of them occupied the four regions, north, south, east, west, and north respectively. ”

“In China, apart from the Cen family, the Lin family’s influence was also all over the country. They could not be underestimated. ”

To the north was Lin Jin Cheng.

“To the West was the third brother, Lin Qing Yang. ”

“To the south was the second brother, Lin Qing Yun. ”

“To the east was the eldest brother, Lin Qing fan. ”

“Wu Mei looked at Old Lady Lin and said earnestly, “Mom, you’ve already missed it once nineteen years ago. This time, don’t make trouble anymore. Let Jin Cheng and his fifth brother and sister-in-law live a good life. You’re also a great-grandmother!”! “Why Bother?” ”

“In Wu Mei’s opinion, Old Lady Lin was just doing it. ”
