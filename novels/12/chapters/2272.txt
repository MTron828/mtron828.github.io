Bai Jingshu remained silent.

“Eldest miss?”The servant called out again.

“Unable to hear the response from inside, the servant sighed and continued, “Eldest miss, why are you doing this?” ”

“Perhaps it was because the situation was different, but from the servant’s point of view, it was a great honor for Bai Jingshu to be able to marry into the Chen family. ”

“As for this girl, the most important thing was to marry the right person! ”

“If her daughter could marry into the Chen family, she would definitely be able to wake up from her dream with a smile. ”

“Unfortunately, her daughter did not have such good fortune. ”

What about Bai Jingshu?

She did not know how to cherish such good fortune.

What a waste of heavenly gifts!

“The maid continued, “Eldest miss, I think Sir and Madam are getting serious this time...” ”

“No matter what the servant outside said, Bai Jingzhu remained silent inside. ”

The servant sighed again and turned to leave.

“Coming Downstairs, Zhou Ying asked, “How was upstairs?” ”

The servant shook her head. “Miss hasn’t spoken a word.”

“Bai Jingfei inserted the straw into the nutrient solution. “My sister isn’t really going to fight to the end, is she?” ”

“I think so.”The maid nodded.

“Bai Jingfei was a little speechless and said, “Some people don’t know how lucky they are. She doesn’t even like the Chen family. Does she still want to marry the President?” ”

“At this point, Bai Jingfei turned to look at Zhou Ying and said, “Mom, if she doesn’t give in, do you really plan to starve her to death?” ”

“Zhou Ying narrowed her eyes. “Don’t worry, she will give in! The feeling of hunger is very uncomfortable!” ”

“”I said in case,”said Bai Jingfei. ”

“There is no in case.”Zhou Ying’s eyes were full of ruthlessness. “Your sister must go to the police station personally to close the case.”

“This kind of Zhou Ying made Bai Jingfei panic inexplicably. She then said, “Mom, what do you think of Me?” ”

“”What do you mean, what do I think?”Zhou Ying asked. ”

Bai jingfei came up with a plan. “Let me marry into the Chen family on behalf of my sister!”This would solve Bai Jingzhu’s problem and fulfill her wish to marry into a rich family. It was killing two birds with one stone.

“Most importantly, she was no less beautiful than Bai Jingzhu. ”

“”The key is, can the Bai family take a fancy to you?”Zhou Ying looked at Bai Jingfei. “Can you go to the police station on behalf of your sister to close the case?” ”

“As soon as she said that, Bai Jingfei immediately turned into a frosty eggplant. ”

Zhou Ying was right. She could not replace Bai Jingshu.

“”Then what should we do?”Bai jingfei grew up with Bai Jingshu. She knew Bai Jingshu’s personality very well. From a young age, as long as it was something that Bai Jingshu had decided on, no one could change it. ”

“Zhou Ying continued, “Why are you in such a hurry? I don’t believe that she can last another two days! Just wait! Tomorrow, she will definitely give in!” ”

Zhou Ying was not in a hurry at all.

It was not difficult to understand that young people all had their own arrogance.

She did not believe that Bai Jingshu could still turn the world upside down!

Bai jingfei frowned slightly.

Another Day had passed.

“From the moment Bai Mo found out that Chen Yaosheng was locked up in the detention center to the moment when she found out that Bai Jingshu was under house arrest, she gloated. ”

“At this moment, Bai Mo suddenly received a message from man Wen. ” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Manwen had sent her a message!

This was simply explosive news.

“Bai Mo opened the message excitedly. Soon, the smile on her face disappeared completely. ”

Because Manwen was asking her about Bai Jingshu.

“Bai Mo continued to reply, “Brother Manwen, I can’t explain this matter clearly. Why Don’t we meet up?”? ”

“Manwen quickly replied, “See you at Lanying cafe at 10 o’clock.”. ”

“After receiving Manwen’s message, Bai Mo sat in front of the mirror and started to dress up. ”

“Half an hour later, she appeared at the Lanying Cafe. ”

Manwen was already sitting at the agreed seat.

Bai Mo walked over. “Brother Manwen.”

Manwen nodded and went straight to the point. “Where’s your sister?”

“Bai Mo had already prepared a set of excuses, she continued, “After my sister went home, she had a fight with my uncle and aunt. Then, my aunt locked her interstellar shuttle so that she couldn’t go to Earth. However, I lent her my own shuttle. She should have arrived on Earth by now.” ”

“A fight?”Man Wen narrowed his eyes. “Why did they fight?”

“Bai Mo shook her head, “I’m not too sure about the specific reason. As a junior, I can’t say anything bad about first uncle and first aunt, but they do sometimes go overboard with my sister. Fortunately, my sister is more independent and mentally strong, or else... “... “...” ”

“At the end of his sentence, it was self-evident. ”

“Man Wen continued, “Are you sure your sister has gone back?” ”
