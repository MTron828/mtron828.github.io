“When Feng Qianxian said this, Zheng Zhilan felt even more heartache for Feng Qianxian. She also felt that ye Zao was a green tea!”

“If it wasn’t for ye Zao’s sudden appearance, then the young miss of the Lin family would be Feng Qianxian Now!”

“Previously, when everyone said that ye Zao’s mother was a mistress, Zheng Zhilan didn’t believe it.”

“Now, she completely believed it!”

“”Xianxian, don’t be like this! Don’t worry, My Brother is not a fool! He will definitely see what kind of person ye Zao is!”” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Feng Xianxian smiled bitterly and shook her head. “Zhilan, forget it! I can’t compare to her!””

“”You can compare!”Zheng Zhilan held Feng Xianxian’s hand. “Xianxian, don’t belittle yourself. In my heart, no one can compare to you!””

“”Zhilan, thank you.”Feng Xianxian hugged Zheng Zhilan.”

“From an angle that Zheng Zhilan could not see, Feng Xianxian revealed a smug smile.”

Zheng Zhilan was a person with a strong sense of justice.

She could do anything for her friend!

“With Zheng Zhilan’s words, Ye Zhuo would not have a good ending today.”

The Zheng family had a backer in the capital.

“Ye Zhuo was just the eldest daughter of the Lin family that she recognized on the way back. His name was not legitimate. Even if Zheng Zhilan really did something to her, Ye Zhuo could only suffer this loss.”

Zheng Zhilan consoled Feng Xianxian for a long while before Feng Xianxian’s emotions gradually calmed down.

“Not long after, the two of them returned to their seats.”

“Zheng Zimo happened to be chatting with Ye Zhuo about chess. He turned to look at Zheng Zhilan and said with a smile, “Zhilan, you’re here. I forgot to tell you just now. My Goddess is that YC streamer who plays chess very well.””

YC?

“Upon hearing this, Zheng Zhilan’s eyes lit up and she instantly forgot everything.”

One had to know that she worshipped YC very much!

“Zheng Zhilan asked impatiently, “Is she the YC who won against the national champion previously?””

“Zheng Zimo nodded. “Yes, that’s her.””

“This time, Zheng Zhilan could no longer remain calm. She looked at ye Zhuo and exclaimed in surprise, “D * mn! You’re the Ye of Sitara YC?””

“Ye Zao nodded slightly. “Yes, it’s me.””

“”Ahhh!”Zheng Zhilan jumped up excitedly, “Idol! Goddess! I’m your fan! I didn’t know you very well before this. Ever since I saw the match between you and my idol, I’ve completely fallen in love with you! Oh right, my idol is Mr. Yun Shen! Goddess, can you give me an autograph?”Speaking up to this point, zheng Zhilan stretched her arm in front of ye Zao.”

“Like Zheng Zimo, Zheng Zhilan liked chess very much.”

Mr. Yun Shen was a national player in the chess world.

He had never lost to a live streamer in the couscous competition half a month ago.

“Since then, Zheng Zhilan became a fan of ye Zao.”

“But because ye Zao had only shown his face at Miao Yin’s anniversary party last year, he had not shown his face on the live broadcast since then. In addition, Zheng Zhilan had only known ye Zao for a short time, and Ye Zao had not been on the live broadcast recently, therefore, she did not realize that Ye Zao was the live streamer on her new fans.”

Zheng Zimo handed ye Zao a pen.

Ye Zao took the pen and signed Zheng Zhilan’s wrist.

The pen was in the wind.

“This handwriting was like her whole person, with a hint of coldness in it.”

“Zheng Zhilan looked at this handwriting, and her eyes were filled with amazement.”

It was said that one’s handwriting was like a person’s.

“Ye Zhuo’s handwriting was so good, how could it be the kind of scheming green tea.”

They must have misunderstood ye Zhuo.

“Zheng Zhilan continued, “Goddess, please sign your name on My Shirt Too!””

Ye Zhuo looked at the white t-shirt on Zheng Zhilan and raised his eyebrows slightly. “Are you sure?”

“Yes!”Zheng Zhilan nodded without hesitation.

Ye Zhuo then picked up a pen and signed Zheng Zhilan’s white t-shirt.

“Looking at the two signatures on Zheng Zhilan’s body, Zheng Zimo suddenly felt a little envious. “Goddess, can you sign for me too?””

“Where do you want to sign?”Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows.

“Sign here.”Zheng Zimo rolled up his sleeves.

Ye Zhuo continued to sign.

Feng Xianxian’s face turned pale. She never thought that things would change so dramatically.

Was Zheng Zimo and Zheng Zhilan putting on an Act?

Were they trying to kill ye Zao?

They were clearly here to seek justice for her. Why did they suddenly become ye Zao’s fans?

“Zheng zhilan continued, “Idol, do you have time now? Let’s Find a tea room. How about we play a game? My brother and I have pretty good chess skills!””

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “You guys decide the place.”

“It was rare to meet fans in real life, so ye Zhuo did not want to spoil the mood.”
