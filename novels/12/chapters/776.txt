But everything that belonged to her was taken away by Ye Zhuo.

She wanted to turn Old Lady Lin and Lin Jincheng against each other.

It would be best if Lin Jincheng could take ye Zhuo and Lin ze away from the Lin family manor.

Old Lady Lin was still alive. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“If Lin Jincheng took ye Shu and the others away, then Lin Jincheng would have lost the right to inherit.”

When that time came.

Would everything in the Lin family have anything to do with Lin Jincheng?

Everything in the Lin family should belong to her!

When she got everything in the Lin family.

What was this damn old woman to her?

“Old Lady Lin looked at Feng Xianxian and suddenly had mixed feelings. “What do you mean dead or Alive! Silly Child, don’t talk nonsense! You’re still so young! The one who should die should be me, this old woman!””

“Feng Xianxian held Old Lady Lin’s hand. “Grandma, don’t say that. I’m the daughter of a sinner. All of this is retribution...””

“In front of Old Lady Lin, Feng Xianxian never avoided Feng Qianhua.”

She was even destined to mention Feng Qianhua.

Because she knew that only in this way could she resonate with Old Lady Lin.

“”Xianxian, this isn’t your fault. It’s not your fault at all,”Old Lady Lin sobbed. “Silly child, don’t worry. Although you don’t have a mother anymore, you still have a grandmother like me. Don’t worry. From now on, I will never let you be alone.””

Feng Xianxian was stunned.

“Old Lady Lin continued, “Pack up and come home with me?””

“”Go back to your house?”Feng Xianxian asked, feigning doubt.”

“Old Lady Lin said, “It will be your house in the future.””

“Feng Xianxian hesitated. “Grandmother, this isn’t good. Uncle Lin and Auntie Ye won’t agree.””

“Hearing that Lin Jincheng and ye Shu didn’t agree, Old Lady Lin frowned and said, “I’m the one in charge of the Lin family now. What right do they have to disagree!””

She was the old lady of the Lin Family!

Did she not even have the right to bring a person home?

“Feng Qianxian continued, “Grandma, you’re already so old. I don’t want you to be wronged in front of anyone because of my matter. It’s fine for me to live here alone. You Don’t have to worry.””

Not Worried?

How could old Lady Lin not be worried?

“Old Lady Lin Thought for a moment and continued, “Qianxian, just you wait. I’ll definitely settle this matter properly and then bring you home openly.””

“”Grandma, what do you want?”Feng Xianxian looked at Old Lady Lin anxiously.”

“Old Lady Lin Smiled at Feng Xianxian. “Silly child, Grandma will not let you be alone.”She planned to let Lin Jincheng and ye Shu take Feng Xianxian as their goddaughter.”

“This way, Feng Xianxian would be able to live in the Lin family smoothly.”

“After Old Lady Lin returned, she found Lin Jincheng and told him about this matter.”

“Lin Jincheng frowned and said, “You want me to acknowledge Feng Xianxian as my goddaughter? Are you crazy?””

Old Lady Lin did not want to quarrel with Lin Jincheng. She came to Lin Jincheng for the purpose of making Lin Jincheng accept Feng Xianxian as his goddaughter.

“”Jincheng, mother is already so old. All these years, I have never asked you for anything. This is the only time.”At this point, Old Lady Lin paused, then, she continued, “And this time, it was ye Zao’s fault! If ye Zao had not used his methods to defeat Xianxian, Xianxian would not have fallen into a slump!””

“In Old Lady Lin’s view, this was ye Zao’s fault.”

It was ye Zao who had won disgracefully.

“If ye Zao had not defeated Feng Xianxian, Feng Xianxian would not have fallen seriously ill. She felt her heart ache just looking at him.”

“”What do you mean disgraceful! Even the examiner did not question Zao Zao, what right do you have to question her?”Lin Jincheng looked at Old Lady Lin. “Are you still Zao Zao’s biological grandmother?””

“Acknowledge Feng Qianhua’s daughter as your goddaughter! How can you say that! Don’t you think you’ve gone too far?”

“At this moment, Lin Jincheng could hardly control his emotions.”

“Old Mrs. Lin said with red eyes, “Jincheng, I’m your mother! My own mother! I’m about to be a dying person, and I’m making such a small request of you. Is that too much? Do you think I’ve gone too far?””

“Lin Jincheng said angrily, “If you hadn’t gone too far, would you have forced fourth brother to sever ties with you?””
