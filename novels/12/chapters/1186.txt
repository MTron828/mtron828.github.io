“Since they had already broken up, there was no need to keep wechat anymore. ”

It was just that he had let Zhao Xueyin down.

He should have dragged Yang Wenhao to apologize to Zhao Xueyin just now.

“Thinking of this, the lawyer drank another mouthful of beer. ”

...

Shunxi Financial Group.

“I want to see your President Ye.”

Father Zhao had just walked into the hall when he saw a tall figure standing at the reception desk. He was wearing a smoke-gray suit and had a straight posture. Father Zhao had noticed him because of what he had said.

He said that he wanted to see President Ye?

Who Was President Ye?

Ye Zhuo.

“Ye Zhuo had made Zhao Xueyin suffer so many silent losses. Hearing ye Zhuo’s name from the man’s mouth, Father Zhao frowned slightly. He subconsciously slowed down and looked in that direction. ”

He was very curious. What was the relationship between this man and Ye Zhuo?

Could it be that he was Cen Shaoqing?

“The lady at the front desk looked at the man and said politely, “Sir, do you have an appointment?” ”

“”I’m President Ye’s uncle, Ye Sen.”the man smiled and said, “Uncle is here to see his niece. Do you need an appointment?” ”

Uncle?

Ye Zhuo’s uncle?

Father Zhao narrowed his eyes.

Could it be that ye Langhua had a son?

That old man ye Manshan actually had a grandson!

What was going on?

How come he had never heard that ye Langhua had a son?

How could ye Manshan have a grandson!

“For a moment, father Zhao felt very uncomfortable. ”

“Humans were very strange animals. The more they couldn’t get something, the more they wanted it. ”

Father Zhao placed great importance on the issue of children.

There were three people who founded the Shunxi Financial Group.

“Ye Manshan, Zhang Yifeng, and him. ”

“Among these three people, Zhang Yifeng had never had a family and had no children. ”

He and ye Manshan were the only ones left.

Ye Manshan had a daughter.

It was ye Langhua.

The eighteen-year-old ye Langhua was well-known in the capital. She was known as a talented woman in her prime.

Father Zhao once thought that he would never be able to compare to ye Manshan in his life.

“After all, although ye Manshan did not have a son, he had a good daughter. ”

“Fortunately, the heavens had eyes. ”

The twenty-year-old ye Langhua had shocked everyone. She had turned from a talented girl of the Golden Age into a crazy woman.

“In order to celebrate this matter, Father Zhao specially opened a bottle of champagne that night. ”

“In his life, he hated being trampled under the feet of others. ”

Even if it was a collaborator.

“When he reached middle age, Father Zhao finally had a daughter of his own. ”

“His daughter did not disappoint him, and she had been his pride since childhood. ”

“Ye Manshan’s daughter was a lunatic, and Zhang Yifeng did not have any children. Of these three people, Father Zhao was the winner in life. ”

“Therefore, in the last ten years of this year, although Father Zhao had always regretted that Zhao Xueyin was not a son, he was also full of superiority. ”

“Although he did not have a son, he had an excellent daughter! ”

“She was many times better than ye Manshan and Zhang Yifeng, who had no descendants. ”

Who knew.

Ye Langhua would suddenly find his biological daughter.

“Not only did ye Langhua find his biological daughter, but a granddaughter who was better than Zhao Xueyin in all aspects also appeared. ”

How could he tolerate this?

And now he had a son!

How could ye Langhua have a son?

A person who had no descendants actually had a son.

“This made father Zhao feel very unbalanced, and his breathing became rapid. ”

Over here.

“Hearing Ye Sen’s words, the front desk lady glanced at Ye Sen and still had a businesslike look on her face. “I’m sorry, sir. If you want to see President Ye, you have to make an appointment in advance.” ”

Everyone in Shunxi Financial Group knew that ye Langhua was elder Ye’s only daughter.

Ye Langhua only had one daughter.

Then where did ye Zhuo get his uncle from.

It was very obvious.

The Man in front of her was an imposter!

“The forest was really big, and there were all kinds of birds. ”

“After saying that, the lady at the front desk continued, “Sir, if you don’t have an appointment, you can call President Ye. As long as president ye agrees, we will immediately get someone to take you to President Ye’s office.” ”

“Ye Sen smiled and said, “If I can contact your President Ye, I will waste my words on you! Young Lady, don’t worry, I am definitely not a liar. Why Don’t You Help Me Contact Your President Ye?” ”

“Xiao Gu.”Father Zhao smiled and went forward.

“”Elder Zhao!”Seeing Father Zhao, the lady at the front desk immediately said respectfully. ”

“Father Zhao continued, “Xiao Gu, I can prove that this gentleman is President Ye’s uncle. Let him go up.” ”

“Okay.”Xiao Gu nodded.

“Ye Sen looked at Father Zhao and said gratefully, “Thank you, Old Sir.” ”
