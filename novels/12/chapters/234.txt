“Ye Zhuo was only a third-year high school student, how could she be so amazing? ”

“Ye Sen smiled and said, “Sister, don’t say that you don’t believe it. If I didn’t see it with my own eyes, I wouldn’t believe it either.” ” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“After saying that, ye sen continued, “Little White, tell my sister who your creator is.” ”

“Little White raised its cute little head. “Of course it’s the most beautiful thing in the entire universe, Great Burning!” ”

Ye Shu didn’t dare to believe it at first.

“But when she heard this, she immediately believed it. ”

This tone.

This attitude.

It was simply like a hair of ye burning.

“Ye Sen continued, “Sister, there’s mung bean porridge and pancakes in the pot. If you’re hungry, eat some. I don’t have time. I’ll go to the office first.” ”

“”Okay.”Ye Shu nodded and urged ye sen, “Go and do your work quickly.” ”

“”Master, let me heat up the porridge for you.”Little White suddenly said. ”

“Ye Shu said in surprise, “You can heat up porridge?” ”

“”Of course!”Little White said proudly, “Not only can I heat up porridge, I can also clean up and take out the garbage. I know a lot of things!” ”

“Then you’re really amazing!”

“Of course! I’m Super Invincible in the Universe!”

Ye Shu:”...”

Ye Sen rushed to the company.

He had just parked the car.

“When he got out of the car and left, he accidentally bumped into someone because he was too anxious. ”

“I’m really sorry. Are You Okay?”Ye Sen quickly helped her up.

“The other party was a young woman who was dressed fashionably. She was very beautiful and had exquisite facial features. She patted the dust off her body and said in a reasonable manner, “I’m fine. You didn’t do it on purpose!” ”

“After confirming that the other party was really fine, Ye Sen did not stay here any longer. He jogged into the company. ”

He still had a lot of things to deal with.

“After ye Sen left, the young woman quickly left as well. ”

He got off work at night.

“Ye Sen went to the convenience store to buy instant noodles. When he was checking out at the cashier counter, he found that he did not have any money in his pocket. “Can you pay with your phone?” ”

“”Yes, sir.”The cashier pointed at the QR code on the counter. “Just scan this.” ”

Ye Sen took out his phone.

“Coincidentally, his phone was out of battery. ”

“Just as he was feeling awkward, a pleasant voice sounded. “Pay for this gentleman’s things with mine.” ”

“Alright.”The cashier nodded. “A total of 126 yuan.”

The young woman handed the cashier two RMB notes.

Ye Sen looked at her in surprise.

He felt that this person was somewhat familiar.

“After a while, he remembered this person. “You, you are the lady that I accidentally bumped into this morning?” ”

“The young woman was stunned at first, then she reacted. “So it’s you.” ”

“Ye Sen smiled and said, “I’m really sorry this morning! Thank you for paying for me.” ”

“”In the vast sea of people, meeting each other is also a kind of fate. You’ve already apologized for what happened this morning.” She continued, “I’m for everyone, and everyone is for me. I’m actually helping myself by helping you. Everyone has their own difficulties.” ”

Ye Sen looked at her in surprise.

He felt that this girl was very cultured.

“If everyone could think like her, then the world would be very harmonious and beautiful. ”

“Ye Sen continued, “No matter what, I have to thank you. If you don’t mind, leave a wechat message. When I go back, I’ll transfer the money to you.”Ye Sen not only bought instant noodles, but also coffee and sports drinks. ”

“In total, it was seventy to eighty yuan. ”

“”There’s no need.”The young woman continued, “If you really want to thank me, next time you meet someone who needs help, if you can lend a hand, it will be considered as returning the money.” ”

“Ye Sen continued, “My surname is Ye. I work at Shengdong Express. Don’t worry, I definitely have no other intentions.” ”

“The young woman smiled. “Mr. Ye, you misunderstood. I know you have no other intentions. I’m serious. Next time you meet someone who needs help, remember to lend a hand.” ”

“Ye Sen still felt a little guilty. “By the way, I drove here. Where do you live? Why Don’t I Send You Back?” ”

“”No need,”the young woman continued, “I can go back myself.” ”

“With that, the young woman turned and left. ”

Ye Sen looked at her back and inexplicably felt that he had a good impression of this girl.

“In today’s society, it was rare to see a girl like her. ”

After school at night.

Ye Zhuo came to the Ye family’s private restaurant immediately and saw ye Shu busy in the shop.

Ye Zhuo quietly walked over and hugged ye Shu. “Mom! I missed you so much!”
