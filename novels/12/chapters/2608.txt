Translator: 549690339

Li hang was very excited now.

He wanted to cheer.

She finally didn’t have to envy an Lizi anymore.

She could also have everything an Lizi had.

“But, in addition to being excited, she didn’t forget to let herself calm down. ”

Calm down.

She had to calm down.

“Firstly, she couldn’t lose face in front of boss Wang. ”

“Secondly, she couldn’t be deceived by someone who had intentions. ”

“Some people were good at showmanship. In fact, they didn’t have anything. However, famous cars and watches were all rented. ”

She had to stay awake and not be deceived.

“Soon, she arrived at the VIP seat in the front row. ”

“There was already a dedicated waiter waiting there. “Boss Wang, over here.” ”

“Boss Wang nodded and turned to look at Zhou Cuihua. He said in a gentlemanly manner, “Ms. Zhou, have a seat.” ”

“Thank you.”Zhou cuihua smiled and thanked him.

“”Hang Hang, please sit beside your mother,”boss Wang continued. ”

Li hang nodded.

“After the three of them took their seats, boss Wang looked at the waiter and said, “I’d like a cup of Blue Mountain.” ”

“After saying that, he turned to look at Zhou Cuihua and Li Hang. “What do you two want to drink?” ”

“”I’m the same as you,”Zhou Cuihua said. ”

“Li hang smiled and said, “I won’t be able to sleep with coffee tonight. Please give me a cup of orange juice.” ”

“Okay.”Boss Wang nodded. “Two cups of Blue Mountain and one cup of freshly squeezed orange juice.”

“Please wait a moment.”

There were still ten minutes before the start of the musical.

“Three minutes later, the waiter came over with coffee and orange juice and a plate of exquisite desserts. ”

“Li hang picked up his phone and took a photo. Together with the ticket, he sent it to his wechat moments. ”

There were a bunch of comments below.

“[ ah Ah Ah, I’ve wanted to watch it for a long time, but I haven’t been able to buy a ticket! ] ”

[ envy! ]

[ hang hang doesn’t admit that he’s a rich second generation. ]

“[ sob sob sob, I want to watch a musical with my goddess. ] ”

“[ no selfies, bad reviews. ] ”

[ ... ]

Li Hang’s popularity was very good. The likes on his moments quickly exceeded 200.

“Not long after, Li Hang received a few wechat messages from his friends. ”

“The contents of the messages were almost the same, and they wanted her to help buy a ticket for a musical. ”

“Since Li Hang had a way to get a VIP ticket, he definitely had a way to buy a normal ticket. ”

But Li Hang declined.

“She had just met boss Wang for the first time, so she couldn’t ask for help on their first meeting. ”

“At this moment, Li Hang received a wechat message from his best friend, Wang Rui. ” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“[ hang hang, look, this is so infuriating! Zhao Jing, this green tea whore! ] ”

“Soon, Wang Rui sent a screenshot of the wechat group. ”

The conversation on the screen was as follows:

“”D * mn, Li Hang is too amazing. He actually got VIP tickets.” ”

“Beautiful women have good relationships. I Can’t be envious of them.”

“If only I looked like her.”

“I heard that Li Hang is a rich second generation. Her father is a rich businessman.”

“Originally, the conversation in the group was purely about being envious of Li Hang and guessing his family background. But at this moment, a discordant comment came out and instantly caused a huge commotion in the group. ”

“What rich second generation? Can’t you guys see it? This picture was bought online. It’s worth ten Yuan.”

The person who spoke was Zhao Jing. She and Li Hang were sworn enemies.

Zhao Jing’s family was well-off and she had quite a bit of status in the industry.

“So, after she finished speaking, she didn’t say anything. ”

“After a few seconds, a young girl who thought she had once been under Li Hang stepped forward. “Senior Zhao Jing, how did you know that senior Li Hang’s picture was bought? Did you check the surveillance at her house?” ”

“I’m jealous.”

A second person immediately jumped out and said.

“”That’s right, that’s right. Could it be that senior Li Hang pressed the surveillance button at senior Li’s House?” ”

“Zhao Jing’s combat ability was extremely strong, she immediately replied, “Facts speak louder than words. If she really bought Li Hang’s tickets and if Li Hang was at the VIP seats, she had even bought the VIP tickets. How many ordinary tickets were left? But, what about a certain someone? When she mentioned buying two tickets, she felt so guilty that she didn’t dare to say anything.” ”

“”Actually, what senior Zhao Jing said does make sense.” ”

“Zhao Jing then sent a message to the group, “I’ve never seen such a hypocritical person in my entire life. She lives in her own world all day long. Isn’t she tired?” ”

Li Hang was furious when he saw the screenshots of the chat logs.

“She didn’t want to ask boss Wang for help because she was afraid that boss Wang would have a bad impression of her. But, in Zhao Jing’s words, she had been mistaken as a party girl. ”

Everything was fake.

“Her best friend sent a voice message, “Hang Hang, Zhao Jing is still trying to mislead everyone in the group!” ”
