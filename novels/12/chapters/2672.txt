“”Where’s the baby? Let’s see the baby!”At this moment, Lin Qingfan and Wu Mei walked over with a smile. ”

“”Uncle,”lin ze greeted politely, “Aunt.” ”

“Bai Jingshu had been married to the Lin family for a long time, so she still didn’t recognize all the relatives of the Lin family. She followed behind Lin ze and greeted, “Uncle, aunt.” ”

“Wu Mei smiled and said, “Jingshu has changed a lot after giving birth to a child. How is it? is the baby noisy at night?” ”

“After the birth of a child, Bai Jingshu’s figure had become much more plump. Her face had also become rounder and more maternal. ”

“Bai Jingshu said, “It’s okay. It’s not very noisy, but it’s noisy every now and then.”Newborn babies usually had this period, but fortunately, the Lin family had a two-month-old sister-in-law. ”

It was fine as long as the child was noisy at night.

“Wu Mei said, “It’s fine if it’s not noisy at night. Some children don’t gain any weight at night. They only gain one or two pounds in a month.” ”

“After saying that, Wu Mei continued, “Where’s the child? Quickly carry him over and let me take a look.” ”

“”I think my parents took him away,”Bai Jing Shu said. “I’ll go look for him.” ”

“Wu Mei said, “No, no, I’ll go by myself.” ”

Wu Mei pulled Lin Qingfan and walked to the other side.

“Soon, they saw ye Shu in the crowd. ”

“Ah Shu!”Wu Mei called out. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“”Sister-in-law!”Ye Shu was very happy to see Wu Mei. “Big Brother and sister-in-law, when did you guys arrive?” ”

“”We just arrived!”Wu Mei smiled and said, “This must be the baby! Let me take a look!” ”

Ye Shu carried the child and walked to Wu Mei’s side.

“When Wu Mei saw the baby clearly, she exclaimed, “Oh my God! This doesn’t look like a baby who has just reached the full moon!” ”

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “This baby is indeed growing faster than an ordinary baby.” ”

“Let me carry him.”Wu Mei took the baby from ye Shu’s hands.

“”He’s so heavy!”Wu Mei smiled and said, “I remember the ones in my family weighed about 10 kilograms when they reached the full moon!” ”

“After saying that, Wu Mei continued, “By the way, does the baby eat breast milk or milk powder?” ”

“”Breast milk,”ye Shu said. ”

“Wu Mei said, “Breast milk is still better. The older one in my family said that we should pay attention to the management of our figure. After giving birth, he left the baby to his sister-in-law and didn’t ask about it.” ”

“Speaking of this, Ye Shu didn’t know what to say. Wu Mei continued, “Your Jingshu is still the best. She’s obedient and sensible. She even knows how to show filial piety to her parents.” ”

Wu Mei had two sons and two daughters-in-law. Both of them had their own characteristics. It was not that they were unfilial. It was just that young people’s thoughts were too avant-garde. There were always some differences between them and the older generation.

“Fortunately, Wu Mei did not want to care about those things. Most of the time, she would turn a blind eye. ”

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “Actually, Wenjing and Huihui are both rare good children. You, don’t think too much. Young people have their own ideas and small families. You can just let them solve many things on their own.” ”

“Wu Mei had a strong personality. Ever since she married Lin Qingfan, she had been controlling both her family and her daughter-in-law. It was impossible for her to interfere in her son’s and daughter-in-law’s matters now. ”

“Wu Mei nodded. “Yes, I know. That’s why they can do whatever they want now. I Don’t care anymore!” ”

“After saying that, Wu mei continued, “But Ah Shu, I still envy you. Jingshu is such a good child! She’ll do whatever you say!” ”

“Ye Shu said, “Jingshu is indeed a good child.” ”

“”If my two children are half as good as Jingshu, I won’t Say Anything!”Wu Mei said. ”

“Just as Wu Mei was about to say something else, ye Shu gently poked Wu Mei’s arm with her finger. Then, she changed the topic and said with a smile, “Your family should be in the third grade in the second half of the year, right?” ”

“Wu Mei was also a smart person. She knew that there must be something wrong with Ye Shu’s sudden change of topic. She immediately smiled and said, “Yes! It’s almost time for third grade.” ”

“Ye Shu sighed and said, “Time really flies! It’s only a blink of an eye!” ”

“I know!”

“At this moment, a pleasant voice appeared in the air. “Auntie, Mom.” ”

Ye Shu looked up and smiled. “Wenjing is here.”

“That’s right. It was Wu Mei’s eldest daughter-in-law, Cai Wenjing. ”

“Cai Wenjing was born into a prestigious family. She was good-looking and had a new style of thinking. She often thought of new ideas, so she was always at odds with Wu Mei. However, the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law did not have any big conflicts. ”

“Wu Mei smiled and said, “Wenjing, come and see the baby.” ”

“Cai Wenjing walked over and said with a smile, “He’s so cute! Let me give him a hug!” ”

Wu Mei handed the baby to Cai Wenjing.

“Ye Shu then asked, “Wenjing, where are Duan Duan and Rui Rui?” ”

Duan and Rui Rui were both Cai Wenjing’s children.

“Cai Wenjing said, “Follow behind their aunt! Their aunt and nephew haven’t seen each other for a long time. They are very intimate!” ”

“Of course, the aunt was referring to ye Zao. ”

“The younger generation of the family liked ye Zao very much. Every time they came to the capital, they would always surround ye Zao. ”

“Wu Mei smiled and said, “Fortunately, Zao Zao also likes children. Otherwise, with so many children following behind her, it would be so annoying.” ”

“Cai Wenjing said, “I know, right? The children are chattering so much that their heads are about to explode!” ”

“Then.., cai Wenjing continued, “You said that our genes are really strange. In all these years, other than searing, no other girls have appeared. When I was pregnant with Rui Rui Rui, I thought it was a girl. I didn’t expect it to be a boy!” ”

“Cai Wenjing liked girls very much. Before she got pregnant, she did not believe in the rumors of only having boys and not girls. After giving birth to two sons, she completely believed it. ”

“Most importantly, not only did she give birth to sons, but her sisters-in-law also gave birth to sons. ”

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “I also thought that Ah Ze could change his genes. After all, he and searing are twins.” ”

“When Bai Jingshu was pregnant, Ye Shu was still looking forward to it. She thought that Bai Jingshu was pregnant with twins. ”

“Cai Wenjing said, “Auntie, then you really think the same as me! I think so too!” ”

Who knew that Bai Jingshu was pregnant with a boy.

“Ye Shu continued, “Genes are too powerful!” ”

“Wu Mei asked, “By the way, does your Jingshu still want a second child?” ”

“”I’m not sure, so I didn’t ask.”Ye Shu smiled and said, “This kind of thing depends on the couple themselves.”As an elder, it was not appropriate for them to interfere too much. ”

“Wu Mei nodded. “Yes, let them make their own decisions about the affairs of the young people.” ”

“Wu Mei did a good job in this regard. Even if her daughter-in-law did not want children, she would not say anything more. ”

“Cai Wenjing continued, “Actually, Jingshu can have another child. What if she has a Daughter?” ”

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “I can’t say for sure.” ”

“”At that time, I wanted to have a second child because I wanted to have a daughter. I didn’t expect to have a son after giving birth to Rui Rui.”When she said this, Cai Wenjing was filled with regret. She really liked cute and obedient daughters, with her and Lin Zhao’s genes, they would definitely have a beautiful daughter. ”

“Unfortunately, the heavens did not grant her wish. ”

“At this moment, Bai Jingshu walked over. Cai Wenjing immediately waved her hand. “Jingshu, over here.” ”

“Sister-in-law.”Lin Zhao was the eldest in the Lin family.

“Cai Wenjing continued, “Jingshu seems to have gained some weight.” ”

Bai Jingshu nodded. “She gained 10 pounds.”

“In the past, Bai Jingshu only weighed 100 pounds. Now, she weighed 110 pounds. ”

“After giving birth, not only did she gain weight, but her figure also became more out of shape. This was also the reason why many people suffered from postpartum depression. ”

“Fortunately, Bai Jingshu was a cheerful person. In addition, she had a good relationship with Lin Ze. Lin Jincheng and ye Shu were not the kind of vicious in-laws, so there was no such problem as postpartum depression. ”

“Cai Wenjing said, “It’s okay if you’re ten pounds overweight, but I gained nearly twenty pounds at that time! And that’s before I breastfed the baby! If I breastfed the baby, I’d probably be even fatter! Right, is your baby and breast milk still milk powder?” ”

“”Breast milk.”Bai Jingshu did a lot of homework when she was pregnant. She said that if the baby drank breast milk, it would be better for the baby and the adults. ”

“Cai Wenjing said, “I suggest you stop breastfeeding and give the child milk powder.” ”

“Ah?”Bai Jingshu was stunned.

“Cai Wenjing continued, “Anyway, children who drink breast milk until they are about one year old will have to quit. It’s better for them to quit early. Moreover, drinking breast milk will cause their breasts to sag, and they won’t be able to correct it in the future...” ”

Wu Mei was a little angry when Cai Wenjing said a bunch of bad things about breast milk.

“She did not like Cai Wenjing’s behavior in the first place, but this was great! Cai Wenjing did not want to breast-feed herself, and now she was trying to harm Bai Jingshu! ”

What the hell was going on!

“Wu Mei did not want to interrupt Cai Wenjing directly. She smiled and changed the topic. “By the way, Jingshu, do you plan to have a second child?” ”

“Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “I want to have another child. No matter if it’s a boy or a girl, it’s better to have a partner than to have a child.” ”

“Wu Mei nodded. “Jingshu, you’re right.” ”

“Cai Wenjing said, “Actually, I still like having both children. Jingshu, if you’re not sure if your second child is a girl, I suggest you don’t have one!”! “It takes a year to give birth, and another year to recover after giving birth. Women don’t have many years of youth to waste.” ”

Wu Mei was furious.

“As her eldest daughter-in-law, she was good at everything except talking. Every family wanted more children, but Cai Wenjing had to ruin the mood. ”

“Fortunately, Ye Shu didn’t argue with her! ”

“Bai Jingshu looked at Cai Wenjing and continued, “AH ze likes girls more. Actually, I can do either. After giving birth to a second child, I want to give the child a companion. If anything happens in the future, I can have someone to discuss it with.” ”

“”Yes, yes, yes.”Wu Mei nodded with a smile. “For example, in our family, having more people is also more powerful.” ”

On the other side.

In Ye Zao’s room.

“A group of children surrounded ye Zao, chattering away. ”

Cen Shaoqing sat at the side with a headache. How could these children be so talkative?

“”Auntie, didn’t you say that you went to my house to visit me last time? Why didn’t you go in the end?” ”

“”Aunt, do you and uncle not want to Get Married?” ”

“”If you get married, will I not be able to see you?” ”
