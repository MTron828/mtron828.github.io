“The assistant immediately walked to song Shiyu’s side and said in a low voice, “The Chen family is already in chaos.” ”

“His only granddaughter was dead, and Chen Youlong was even locked up in the detention center. He was facing decades of imprisonment, so wasn’t it a mess? ”

“Song Shiyu narrowed his eyes, and only a happy expression flashed across his eyes. ”

The assistant was stunned.

It was as if it was the first time he had met song Shiyu.

“Although he knew his boss’s personality, he could not help but feel a chill when he experienced it personally. ”

It was said that the human heart was unpredictable.

“In fact, Song Shiyu’s heart was the most unpredictable. ” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

One had to know that the Chen family at that time was also the one supported by song Shiyu.

“Chen Youlong provoked one disaster after another in yunjing, and all of them were quietly solved by song Shiyu. ”

But now.

“Not only did song Shiyu not care about the Chen family’s suffering, he even added fuel to the fire. ”

“Where’s Jin Yuan?”Song Shiyu continued to ask.

“The assistant replied, “Lawyer Jin is already helping the Zhao family Sue Chen Youlong.” ”

Song Shiyu nodded in satisfaction.

“The assistant seemed to have thought of something and added, “Lawyer Jin asked me to tell you that once the crime is convicted, there will be no room for negotiation.” ”

“Let him not have to worry about the consequences.”Song Shiyu picked up a cigarette and a lighter.

“PA –”

A string of faint blue flames ignited from the lighter.

Song Shiyu was about to light the cigarette when he suddenly thought of something and threw the cigarette and the lighter into the trash can.

The assistant looked at song Shiyu with confusion in his eyes.

He had seen this scene hundreds of times.

Every time song Shiyu lit his cigarette first and then the trash can. He was never tired of this.

“”Knock, Knock, Knock –” ”

“At this moment, there was a knock on the door. ”

The assistant immediately trotted over to open the door.

“When the door opened, he saw a face full of smiles. ”

“Is third brother in?”The person asked.

“”The boss is inside,”the assistant said respectfully. “Mr. Bai, please come in.” ”

Yes.

The person was Bai Jiayu.

Bai Jiayu walked in. “Third brother.”

“What’s Wrong?”Song Shiyu turned to look at Bai Jiayu.

“Bai Jiayu took a puff of the cigarette in his hand. “Third brother, what happened to the Chen Family? Why did I hear that Chen Siyao is gone?” ”

Song Shiyu frowned slightly. “Press it down.”

Press it down?

Press what down?

Bai Jiayu was stunned.

“”Cigarette,”song Shiyu continued. ”

“Bai Jiayu immediately pressed the cigarette in his hand into the ashtray. “I’m sorry, third brother. I forgot that you quit smoking.” ”

Song Shiyu turned to look at his assistant. “Go open the window.”

“Okay.”His assistant immediately went over to open the window.

“Bai Jiayu sat across from Song Shiyu. “Third brother, the Chen family...” ”

“”The Chen family is seeking their own destruction,”song Shiyu interrupted Bai Jiayu’s unfinished sentence. ”

“Bai Jiayu continued, “When I heard that Chen Siyao committed suicide, I thought it was just a joke. I didn’t expect...”who would have thought that Chen Siyao really lost her life. ”

“In the end, Chen Siyao didn’t do anything wrong. ”

Bai Jiayu would feel a little bad about losing someone’s life.

“Thinking of this, Bai Jiayu sighed. “Third brother, Chen Siyao’s love for you is beyond my imagination.” ”

“Bai Jiayu really couldn’t imagine how much Chen Siyao Loved Song Shiyu, to be willing to give up her life for love! ”

“You can’t bear to part with her?”Song Shiyu turned to look at Bai Jiayu.

“”I’m not saying that I can’t bear to part with her. I just think it’s quite shocking,”Bai Jiayu continued. “Third brother, don’t you have any feelings at all?” ”

“What feelings do you think I should have?”Song Shiyu asked. “To cry for her?”

Chen Siyao chose this path herself. No one held a knife to her neck to threaten her.

Bai Jiayu choked. He looked at song Shiyu and was momentarily speechless.

“Is that why you came to me?”Song Shiyu continued to ask.

“Bai Jiayu nodded. “By the way, you don’t plan on meddling in Chen Youlong’s matters anymore?” ”

“”From now on, the Chen family’s matters have nothing to do with me,”song Shiyu said softly. ”

“Bai Jiayu looked at song Shiyu and asked curiously, “Third brother, can you tell me what exactly happened?” ”

What was the reason for song Shiyu’s sudden ruthlessness toward the Chen family!

It was as if he had suddenly become a different person.

“”Nothing,”song Shiyu said. ”

“Bai Jiayu seemed to have suddenly thought of something and continued, “Tonight, the Wang family has organized a game. They are all clean university students. Do you want to go and take a look?” ”
