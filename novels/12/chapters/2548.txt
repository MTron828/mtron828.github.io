Liu Meilian didn’t say anything.

“Wang Dajun added, “Weiwei’s current situation is very bad. When you arrive, try to make her feel love and warmth. Don’t provoke her.” ”

“Liu Meilian was a little speechless and said, “Do I need you to teach me this?”How could she not know what to do? If she didn’t coax Weiwei at this time, what if Weiwei didn’t choose her? ”

Only by becoming Weiwei’s guardian would he be able to take Weiwei’s royalties.

“Therefore, even if it was an act, she would put on a good show! ”

Wang Dajun didn’t say anything else.

“Soon, the car stopped at the parking lot of the hospital. ”

“Liu Meilian opened the car door and said impatiently, “My daughter is staying in that Ward?” ”

“”Wait, I’ll go up with you.” ”

“Liu Meilian said anxiously, “Then hurry up. I suspect that this shameless Xiang Chao has already gone over.” ”

“Wang Dajun said, “He shouldn’t be so fast.” ”

“”What should? Just Xiang Chao, this shameless person, what could he not do? I was really blind to find such a person back then!”Thinking of her choice back then, Liu Meilian was filled with regret. ”

“After saying that, Liu Meilian started to urge Wang Dajun again. “Oh my God, Hurry Up!” ”

Wang Dajun sped up and parked the car. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

The two of them walked towards the inpatient department.

“Very soon, they arrived in front of Weiwei’s ward. ”

“Liu Meilian said impatiently, “Is it the ward in front?” ”

“Yes.”Wang Dajun nodded.

Liu Meilian ran forward and leaned in front of the ward to listen. Xiang Chao’s voice did not come from inside. Liu Meilian heaved a sigh of relief. She did not even have time to knock on the door and ran straight inside.

Wei Wei was resting inside when she heard footsteps. She looked up and saw a middle-aged woman with dyed yellow hair walking in.

“”Auntie, who are you looking for?”Wei Wei asked politely. ”

“Liu Meilian’s tears came as she cried, “Wei Wei, my daughter, I’m your mother! You Don’t Even Know Your Mother?” ”

Weiwei was stunned.

Liu Meilian rushed over and hugged Weiwei.

Weiwei’s expression instantly turned cold as she pushed Liu Meilian away.

“Liu Meilian said very sadly, “Weiwei, you’re sick. Why didn’t you tell Mom? Do you know how worried Mom was about you? These days, Mom couldn’t eat or sleep. It took a lot of effort to find you!” ”

“Wang Dajun, who followed behind, was stunned. ”

This was the first time he knew that a person could be so shameless to this extent!

He could actually say anything that wasn’t true.

It was simply disgusting.

“I don’t have a mom.”Weiwei’s expression was very cold. “You got the wrong person.”

Weiwei would never forget the words Liu Meilian said to her when she cried and chased after Liu Meilian.

“I’m not your mother! Get lost!”

“You’re a burden!”

“After a long, long time, she still could not forget that scene. ”

“Liu Meilian cried, “Wei Wei, you were born in my womb for ten months. How could I have mistaken you for someone else? I didn’t mistake you for someone else. You’re my precious daughter!” ”

Wei Wei did not say anything and pressed the bell.

“Soon, a nurse walked in. “What’s the matter in bed 16?” ”

“Weiwei said with a pale face, “Someone is disturbing my rest here. I don’t know her.” ”

“The nurse looked at the three of them and then walked to Liu Meilian’s side. “Madam, please leave.” ”

“Liu Meilian immediately explained, “Miss Nurse, you have misunderstood. I Am Weiwei’s mother. I really am!” ”

“The nurse had been working here for so long, so she naturally knew about Weiwei’s family situation. ”

“Wow, so the person who sent Weiwei to the hospital the last time was not Weiwei’s parents. The person in front of her was. ”

This was too cruel!

“Weiwei had been in the hospital for so long and she had never shown her face. Now that she suddenly showed up, it was obvious that she had bad intentions! ”

“”Madam, the patient said that she doesn’t know you. Please leave!”The nurse made a gesture of inviting her out. ”

“Liu Meilian said anxiously, “I’m really her mother!” ”

“At this moment, Wang Dajun walked forward. “Xiao Wu, there’s nothing for you to do here. You can leave first.” ”

“Xiao Wu glanced at Liu Meilian and said awkwardly, “But...” ”

“”She’s right. She’s Weiwei’s biological mother.”Wang Dajun continued, “You can leave now.” ”

“With Wang Dajun’s words, even if the nurse wanted to help Weiwei, she could only leave first. ”

“She’s not my mother!”Weiwei said angrily. “I don’t have a mother. My mother died a long time ago!”
