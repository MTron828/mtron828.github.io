Chapter 2065: 428: She’s actually Miss Ye! 5

Translator: 549690339

Man Xing was a very cultured girl.

“She had always been very respectful towards the full moon whom she had never met before. Every time she opened her mouth and shut her mouth, it was her eldest sister. ”

“You Know About It?”Man Jiangshan looked at man Xing in surprise.

“Man Xing nodded, “A little. Actually, you should have brought my eldest sister back long ago! What Natural Disaster Star? It’s all fake. Dad, you should believe in the power of science, not theology!” ”

“Speaking up to this point, man Xing’s eyes were slightly red. “My eldest sister has been through a lot these years.” ”

“Hearing this, man Jiangshan sighed. “Xing ‘er, I know that you have been a kind and good child since you were young. If your eldest sister was half as sensible as you, I would be satisfied.” ”

“All these years, man Xing had been thinking about his eldest sister. ”

What about Ye Zhuo?

“Not to mention that she was thinking about man Xing, even when Zhao Dan went over, she still showed her face to Zhao Dan. ”

“No matter what, Zhao Dan was still ye Zhuo’s mother. ”

“It was not surprising that Zhao Dan was very angry. Ye Zhuo’s actions were indeed rude. If it were him, his reaction might be even greater than Zhao Dan’s. ”

Because this already involved the issue of etiquette.

“Firstly, Zhao Dan was an elder in front of ye Zhuo, and secondly, his mother. ”

How could a junior treat an elder like that?

“”What’s wrong with elder sister?”MAN XING continued, “Did mom find elder sister?” ”

“Man Jiangshan said, “I think so, but your elder sister, she...”the rest was self-evident. ”

“Man Xing saw through man Jiangshan’s worries. “Dad, is elder sister angry?” ”

“Yes.”Man Jiangshan nodded.

“MAN XING continued, “Actually, it’s not entirely elder sister’s fault. From elder sister’s point of view, it’s normal for her to be angry. After all, she has been wandering outside for so many years! “Dad, please don’t be angry with elder sister. Let Mom bring elder sister back as soon as possible so that we can reunite as a family.” ”

Man Jiangshan looked at man Xing and felt very gratified.

Man Xing was really too sensible!

“Not only was man Xing a good daughter, she was also a good sister and a good elder sister. ”

“”Xing ‘er, don’t worry. Your mom is already handling this matter,”said man Jiangshan. ”

“Man Xing nodded, then he said, “Then can mother handle it by herself? Why Don’t I go and persuade elder sister as well. “Although I’m not very clear about the past, I know that you and mother must have their own difficulties. With one more person to persuade elder sister, elder sister can be more open-minded.” ”

“No need. It’s fine as long as you have the heart. Your mother and I will handle this matter.”

Man Jiangshan could not bear to let man Xing suffer this injustice.

Who knew how ye Zao would make things difficult for them.

“MAN XING continued, “Oh right, elder sister must be very good-looking, right? Is she also a very talented girl?” ”

“”I have a photo here. Take a look,”man Jiangshan said. ”

“Okay.”Man Xing nodded.

Man Jiangshan adjusted the photo.

“Looking at the photo that appeared in the air, man Xing’s eyes were filled with amazement. ”

The girl in the photo.

“Her features were like a painting, and her temperament was extraordinary. Every frown and smile was full of charm. ”

Man Xing had never seen such a beautiful girl.

“She had never thought that her eldest sister, who was wandering outside, would be so beautiful. If she had been raised by her parents, wouldn’t that be terrible? ”

“Is... is this my eldest sister?”Man Jiangshan asked.

Man Jiangshan nodded.

“MAN XING smiled and said, “My eldest sister is so beautiful! After seeing my eldest sister, I feel embarrassed to look in the mirror again.” ”

“”Both of you have your own merits,”man Jiangshan smiled and said, “Both of you are my daughters. How Bad Can You Be?” ”

Man Xing was indeed very good-looking.

“She had a standard oval face and exquisite Phoenix eyes. Her skin was as white as snow, and she was tall and graceful. In the past two years, many suitors had stepped through the door. ” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“However, man Xing had rejected them one by one. ”

“She wanted to be as strong as a woman, and a woman was even better. ”

The rumored Miss Ye was her idol.

She wanted to be an existence that surpassed miss ye!

“Man Jiangshan continued, “Is eldest sister living in changyue right now?” ”

“Yes.”Man Jiangshan nodded.

“”Then isn’t she very outstanding in Changyue?”From the Way Ye Zhuo was dressed, one could tell that she had long left her original wandering life. ”

“Man Jiangshan said, “Your eldest sister is now called Ye Zhuo.” ”

Ye Zhuo.

Man Xing was stunned.

“After a moment, he reacted and said, “You Mean Miss Ye? The Miss Ye of Changyue?” ”

“Yes.”Man Jiangshan nodded. “It’s that Miss Ye.”

Man Xing’s eyes were filled with disbelief. Never in her dreams would she have thought that her sister was actually the famous miss ye from Chang Yue!

This was too unbelievable!

“Eldest sister is really amazing!”
