Translator: 549690339

[ maybe it’s because he’s beautiful. Isn’t there an old saying in China? A Hero can’t beat a beauty. ]

“[ I have inside information! ]! It was said that because of the nuclear reactor, YC even had a serious conflict with professor Yue from the CEN base. Therefore, professor Yue felt that it was not worth it. Professor Yue was a real talent. What else could YC do besides bragging? She said that she could build an aircraft carrier, but until now, there was no sign of an aircraft carrier ”

“Nuclear reactors need water to slow down the neutrons, and this YC actually stored them directly. Does she even know about scientific research? A person like this will even build an aircraft carrier! What a joke ”

A person who doesn’t even know how to store a nuclear reactor still wants to build an aircraft carrier? I think she’s Dreaming

“[ using a nuclear reactor as the fuel for an aircraft carrier. Oh My God, is she still asleep? ]? [ I think the people at the CEN base don’t have brains either. They actually dared to cooperate with her. Aren’t they afraid that the nuclear reactor will leak and cause nuclear radiation? ] ”

-LChinahina is a bunch of idioIs. i’m afraid that they don’t even know what nuclear radiation Why why would they be worried about nuclear radiation? ]

“[ I swear! If YC can build a space mothership, I will kneel on the ground and call you dad! ] ”

“[ calling you dad is nothing. If YC can achieve the speed of light, I can live stream eating shit! ] ”

[ add me! ]

[ add one upstairs! ]

[ add one! ]

[ add one! ]

“[ hahaha, if YC can’t build a space mothership, doesn’t that mean that they will call us dad and live stream eating shit? ] ”

[ of course! ]

[ wait for YC to eat SH * T Live! ]

“[ didn’t you see what YC said? She wants to build an aircraft carrier in two years. After two years, who will remember her? By then, we will have already forgotten about this matter! ] ”

[ YC’s matter was reported in the international newspaper. How could she forget it so easily? ]

“[ that’s right, that’s right. When the time comes, there will definitely be a lot of people fighting to slap her in the face! ]! Even if she was bragging, there had to be a limit. Creating an aircraft carrier at the speed of light, did she really think that country C did not exist? If even country C did not dare to brag so easily, she would really dare to say anything! ] ”

“[ right, right, right. When the time comes, the first one who would not let YC off would definitely BE COUNTRY C! ] ”

“Looking at the replies from the researchers from all over the world, Tang Xue’s face was filled with a smug smile. ”

“The matter of the space mothership was getting bigger and bigger. Right now, experts from all over the world were waiting to see ye Zao make a fool of himself. She wanted to see how ye Zao would end up. ”

On the other side.

“After ye Zao finished eating the Duck’s paw, he sat by the side and looked at his phone. He did not know what he saw, but she suddenly chuckled. ”

“Cen Shaoqing was cleaning up the leftovers. Seeing her like this, he looked up curiously. “What are you laughing at?” ”

“Ye Zao said, “I’m going to have a lot of sons soon.” ”

“What do you mean?”Cen Shaoqing raised his eyebrows slightly.

Could it be...

Ye Zao could not wait to give birth to a son for him?

“Thinking of this, Cen Shaoqing’s mind wavered, and his throat felt a little dry. “Leader, leader, do you want it now?”Isn’t that a little inappropriate. Although it was said that one would think about that when one was full, it was still in the office after all... ”

“Seeing that his expression was a little strange, ye Zhuo said speechlessly, “What kind of nonsense are you thinking about? Didn’t you say that you lived like a monk before?” ”

How could a monk understand these things?

“Cen Shaoqing’s eyes were deep. “It’s all thanks to the guidance of the leader.”The subtext was that if you don’t think about those nonsense things, how would you know that I’m thinking about nonsense things? ”

“I can’t be bothered with you.”Ye Zhuo lowered her eyes slightly and took a screenshot of the comments that were about to kneel down and call her father.

“Cen Shaoqing continued to clean up the table and sorted the rubbish into different categories before placing it into the trash can. “Leader, are duck neck bones dry rubbish or wet rubbish?” ”

“Ye Zhuo hesitated for a moment before continuing, “Wet rubbish.” ”

“”Alright.”Cen Shaoqing placed the bones into the wet rubbish bag and then said, “Are wet tissues wet rubbish?” ” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“”Dry garbage,”ye Zao said. ”

Wet tissue is dry garbage?

“Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly, but did not say anything more. He threw the wet tissue into the bag of dry garbage. ”

On professor Yue’s side.

“When they returned home, when Professor Yue’s husband, Wan Sheng, heard the news that Professor Yue had led the members of the entire research room to strike, he was a little worried and said, “Isn’t it a little inappropriate for you to do this?” ”

“That person was, after all, Cen Wu Ye. ”

How could the dignified Cen Wu ye be threatened by Yue Hongyan?
