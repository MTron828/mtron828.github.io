Chapter 42: Let Him Repay You With His Body

Doctor Lin found it unbelievable.

His medical skills were the best in the Yunjing Province. If he claimed to be the best, no one dared to claim to be second.

Who was the person who helped cure Madam Cen’s condition?

If he had known that Madam Cen would be cured by someone else, he wouldn’t have acted so arrogantly. He would not have insisted Madam Cen apologize to him.

If he had gone to the Cen family house with the butler, he would not have single-handedly given others the opportunity to claim any credit for curing Madam Cen’s condition.

Unfortunately, there was no medicine for regret in this world.

Doctor Lin now wished he could beat himself to death.

Suddenly, than rapid ringing of a phone sounded in the air.

Could it be Butler Zhang?

Doctor Lin’s eyes lit up.

The old woman’s condition must have worsened!

He knew it! No one in the Yunjing Province was more skilled than him!

“Hello.” Doctor Lin deliberately delayed for a while before he picked up the phone.

After all, it was the Cen family’s turn to beg him.

He thought Butler Zhang’s voice would appear on the other end, but he did not expect it to be a young female voice.

“Hey! Ah Fu, I’ve already had a look at the house. It has three bedrooms and one living room, and it’s located in the school district. The full payment is 5 million, and the down payment is only 2.6 million. When are you going to transfer the money over?”

Doctor Lin was stunned. “Wen Die? When did you change your number?”

“I just changed it! Didn’t you write it down?”

Doctor Lin was silent, and his expression was very ugly.

“Ah Fu! I’m talking to you! When are you going to transfer the money over?”

“I don’t have that much money at the moment.”

“No money? Didn’t you say that you recently met an old lady with a lot of money? Do you not want to buy a house for us mother and son?”

It would have been better if she did not mention this, but when she mentioned this, Doctor Lin’s expression became even uglier. “Don’t worry about the money first. Give me a little more time.”

The female voice on the other side sounded a little unhappy. “Alright then. Ah Fu, are you coming to my place tonight? Chengye said that he misses you.”

Doctor Lin was going to refuse, but when he heard the name Chengye, the dark cloud on his face dissipated a little. “Alright, I’ll come over after work.”

…

At the same time.

A low-profile black Bentley stopped by the side of the road.

A shabby old lady walked out of the car with a cane and waved at the driver. “You can go back.”

The driver nodded and drove the car away.

Madam Cen stood under the thick camphor tree. The thick leaves provided shelter from the blazing sun. She whipped out an old looking phone from her pocket and dialed a number.

The call was quickly picked up. “Hello.”

The voice was very clear and light, as if it could dispel the scorching heat. It made people feel relaxed and happy.

“Guess who I am!” Madam Cen deliberately pinched her nose while saying that.

On the other end of the phone, Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “Granny Cen!”

“Ye Zi, you are really smart! You guessed it was me at once!” As expected of the granddaughter-in-law she had taken a fancy to.

Ye Zhuo said proudly, “Of course! I’m so smart! By the way, Granny Cen, Where are you now?”

Madam Cen looked at her surroundings. “I’m here at Sunshine Market, 318 North Zhai Road. Ye Zi, where do you live? I’m coming to find you.”

“My home is nearby. Please wait there and don’t move about. I’m coming to pick you up.”

“Okay.”

Not long after Madam Cen hung up the phone, she saw Ye Zi running over from the other side of the road. “Granny Cen!”

“Ye Zi!” Ye Zhuo waved at Madam Cen.

Ye Zhuo was dressed very casually today. She was wearing a red t-shirt and jeans. Under the sunlight, her legs looked slender and long.

Her granddaughter-in-law was so beautiful and her legs were so long. Madam Cen could almost imagine what her great-grandson looked like.

“Ye Zi!” Madam Cen opened her arms to welcome Ye Zhuo.

Ye Zhuo hugged Madam Cen. “Granny Cen.”

Madam Cen’s eyes were filled with satisfaction.

Before arriving here earlier, she had specially sprayed durian essence on her body, and she smelled like durian. However, she did not see a hint of disdain in Ye Zhuo’s eyes.

Ye Zhuo continued, “Granny Cen, my house is over there. Let’s go.”

The two of them chatted along the way and soon arrived at the Ye residence.

Ye Zhuo took out her keys and said, “Granny Cen, this is my house.”

As soon as she opened the door, Madam Cen smelled a fragrance.

As the restaurant was about to open, Ye Zhuo had been experimenting on various recipes at home for the past few days.

Hearing the noise, Ye Shu walked out of the kitchen in an apron. “Zhuo Zhuo is back. Who is this old lady?”

Ye Zhuo introduced, “Mother, this is the Granny Cen I told you about. Granny Cen, this is my mother.”

“Hello, Mrs. Ye.” Madam Cen greeted her with a smile.

“Hello, Granny Cen.”

Madam Cen said, “Mrs. Ye, if you don’t mind, you can just call me Auntie.”

“Auntie Cen.” Ye Shu wasn’t the kind of person who was pretentious. She beckoned Madam Cen to go into the house and have a sit.

Ye Zhuo quickly went in to pour some water for Madam Cen.

Madam Cen calmly sized up the surroundings.

The house interior was very ordinary, but it was very clean and tidy. It could be seen that the owner of the house was a person with a noble heart.

Ye Shu brought over a plate of cut fruits. “Auntie Cen, here, have some fruit.”

“Thank you, Mrs. Ye.”

Ye Shu had always been a very kind person. She smiled and said, “Auntie Cen, just treat this place as your own home. Please don’t stand on ceremony with us.”

By noon, Ye Shu had cooked and prepared a large table of delicious food. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Madam Cen had a huge appetite. “It’s really been a long time since I’ve eaten so happily. Mrs. Ye, your cooking is really superb.”

Ye Shu said, “Auntie Cen, if you like to eat, you can come often in the future.”

“Really?” Madam Cen looked at Ye Shu in surprise.

Ye Shu nodded. “Auntie Cen, do I look like I’m joking with you?” It must not be easy for an old lady to survive with no one to rely on. It was just a meal. If she could help in the slightest, she would happily do so.

Madam Cen was very touched.

There were indeed various different people in this world.

The Mu family were extremely ungrateful people. On the other hand, Ye Zhuo and her mother were good people who didn’t ask for anything in return.

This trip to the Yunjing Province wasn’t in vain.

After eating, Ye Zhuo walked Madam Cen out.

As the two of them walked out of the community gate, Madam Cen held Ye Zhuo’s hand and said, “Ye Zi, you’re really amazing! I only drank that prescription once, and I didn’t have any trouble sleeping last night! Yezi, how can I thank you?! It’s said that a life-saving grace must be repaid with one’s body. It just so happens that I have an eldest grandson. Why don’t I let him repay you on my behalf with his body?”

Ye Zhuo was stunned and looked at Madam Cen in surprise.

Madam Cen continued, “Ye Zi, don’t worry! My eldest grandson is very handsome! He’s also very lovable! Everyone calls him the most handsome person in the capital!”

Finally, Madam Cen added, “And my family has a mine! We really do have a mine!”
