“Chapter 359: 111: Mother and uncle, trying to curry favor with your future uncle, trying to compete with her! 5”

“This voice was like the warm sun in the middle of a cold winter month, dispelling all the haze in his heart. Only then did song Shiyu react and stabilize his body. “I’m fine.””

Ye Zhuo looked at song Shiyu. “Are you feeling unwell?”

“No.”Song Shiyu shook his head slightly. “Let’s go back quickly.”

Ye Zhuo followed song Shiyu’s footsteps.

The car was parked outside the cemetery.

“Seeing the two of them come over, the assistant hurriedly opened the car door.”

Ye Zhuo sat in the back seat.

Song Shiyu also sat in. “Send Miss ye back first.”

“Ye Zhuo said, “Let’s go to your place first. Your clothes are all wet.””

“I’m fine.”

The driver looked at ye Zhuo through the rearview mirror. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

He was a little curious.

Song Shiyu was a loner. It was rare for the opposite sex to get so close to him.

“But not only did miss ye do it, she even made song Shiyu give in.”

“Moreover, the driver saw caution in song Shiyu.”

He was restraining himself.

Who would have thought that the ruthless head of the song family would one day be so timid in front of a little girl?

“If he had not seen it with his own eyes, he would not have believed it.”

“Not long after, the car arrived at the Ye family’s residential area.”

“Ye Zhuo got out of the car to bid farewell to song Shiyu and instructed, “The road is slippery on rainy days. Tell the driver to drive slowly! Oh right, I see that you don’t look too well. Remember to boil some brown sugar, ginger water to drive away the cold when you go back. Don’t catch a cold!””

“Okay.”Song Shiyu nodded slightly.

“After ye Zhuo left, song Shiyu looked up and instructed the driver, “Drive slowly on the road.””

The driver was stunned. He did not expect that he would actually listen to Ye Zhuo’s words.

“Therefore, on the way back, the driver kept the speed of the car at around 60-70 miles per hour.”

“An hour later, the car stopped outside the song family manor.”

“Because of the funeral, the song family’s door was still pasted with a mourning couplet.”

“Song Shiyu had just walked into the hall when a young woman with a mournful expression came up to him. “Shiyu, you’re back.””

Song Shiyu nodded slightly.

“This young woman was called Chen Siyan, the daughter of one of the ten great families, the Chen family.”

“The Chen family and the song family were close friends. Back then, when Song Shiyu needed help the most, old master Chen helped him. Later, when the Chen family was in trouble, Song Shiyu did not forget Old Master Chen’s kindness and helped to protect the Chen family. Therefore.., the relationship between the two families had always been good.”

Chen Siyan had made a lifelong mistake when she saw song Shiyu.

Even though song Shiyu had told her repeatedly...

That he would not like her...

She did not back down.

“For the past ten years, she had been silently standing behind song Shiyu.”

It was fine if he did not like her.

It was fine as long as she liked him.

Liking could make a person humble to the dust.

She could even be happy for an entire day because of a smile from song Shiyu.

She could also be sad for an entire day because of song Shiyu’s gaze.

“After meeting song Shiyu, there was only song Shiyu left in her world.”

“Chen Siyan picked up the porcelain bowl on the table. “Shiyu, this is the ginger soup I made for you. It can dispel the cold. Drink it while it’s hot.””

“”Is there brown sugar in it?”Song Shiyu turned to look at Chen Siyan, his tone slightly cold.”

Brown sugar?

Chen Siyan was stunned.

Didn’t song Shiyu hate the taste of brown sugar the most?

Why did he suddenly want to add brown sugar?

“Chen siyan continued, “There’s no brown sugar in it. If you want brown sugar, I’ll bring it to the kitchen now to add some brown sugar.””

“Okay.”

“Seeing song Shiyu nod, Chen Siyan hurriedly brought the ginger soup to the kitchen.”

“Not long after, she came out with the ginger soup. “Shiyu, be careful, it’s hot.””

“Song Shiyu picked up the porcelain bowl and finished the soup in one gulp. Then, he turned around and went upstairs.”

Chen Siyan looked at his back and her eyes suddenly turned slightly red.

Ten years.

Ten years.

She had known song Shiyu for ten years.

This was the first time song Shiyu had eaten her food.

“In the past, song Shiyu always had the same expression towards her.”

“When song Shiyu drank her ginger soup, Chen Siyan was very happy. When she walked out of the song family’s manor, she still had a smile on her face. She quickly took out her phone to make a call and share this matter with her best friend.”

...

The Mu family’s financial crisis had already been resolved by Li Qiandong.

General Mu was extremely happy.

Who wouldn’t flatter and flatter him if they saw him now?

That was the Li family!

The Li family of the capital city!

Why was Li Qiandong willing to help the mu family?

There must be a reason for Cen Wuye.

“When he thought about how he would soon become Cen Wuye’s father-in-law, General Mu’s face was filled with smiles. He turned his head to look at Shen Rong, “Remember to care about our precious daughter these days. In the future, our mu family will rely on her to carry forward!””
