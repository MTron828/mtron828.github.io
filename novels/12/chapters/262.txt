Translator: 549690339

Ye Zao got first place in the city.

The school forum exploded.

[ F * ck! F * ck! 749 points! Kneel before the Boss! ]

[ full score for composition? Are you sure you’re a science student? ]

“[ I heard that the boss forgot to do a multiple choice question, so he lost one point... ] ”

[ are you serious? ]

“[ I really didn’t expect ye Zao to get first place in the city. Previously, I thought that the people in Class 7 were crazy. Now, it seems that we are. ] ”

Tingting 0216: [ don’t some people want to eat cell phones live? [ screenshot jpg ][ screenshot JPG ]

The people below helped to move the people who said they wanted to eat cell phones live that day.

Those people’s faces were hurting from the slaps.

“At this time, they could only pretend to be dead and not reply. ”

The next day.

“Ye Zao, an Lizi, and Zhao Pingting made an appointment to go to the amusement park together. ”

“However, because Zhao Pingting had something urgent to attend to, she did not go with them. ”

Ye Zhuo arrived at the place where he had arranged to meet an Lizi.

“An lizi asked curiously, “Zhuo Zhuo, did Pingting tell you why she suddenly stopped coming?” ”

“”She seems to be suffering from an upset stomach,”ye Zhuo replied. ”

“An lizi nodded and continued, “Wasn’t she fine yesterday? Oh right, Zhuo Zhuo! Do you know how well Pingting and I cooperated with each other yesterday? We scolded them so much that none of them dared to make a sound! It was so great!” ”

At this moment.

A black car stopped in front of the two of them. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

The car window rolled down.

A well-defined face was revealed.

The hand that was holding the steering wheel was holding a string of Buddhist beads.

An Lizi was stunned.

Who was this man!

He was really handsome.

She had never seen a MAN who could wear a retro button-up shirt so manly!

This appearance and this aura.

He was more than a few streets ahead of the current generation of fresh meat.

“Ye Zao.”

The man said calmly.

“Fifth brother?”Ye Zao raised his eyebrows in surprise.

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “Get on the bus. I’ll send you guys.” ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “No need. The bus should be arriving soon.” ”

“You’re not allowed to park here.”Cen Shaoqing’s tone was indifferent.

Ye Zao did not refuse anymore and brought an lizi onto the bus. “We’re going to the amusement park. I’ll have to trouble fifth brother.”

“Alright.”Cen Shaoqing’s expression remained the same.

“Ye Zao then introduced an Lizi to Cen Shaoqing. “Fifth brother, this is my classmate, an Lizi. Lizi, this is my fifth brother. You can call me fifth brother.” ”

An Lizi was very surprised.

Wasn’t Ye Zao an only child?

Since when did he have a brother?

An Lizi felt that calling him fifth brother seemed a little intimate. “I’ll still call you Mr. Ye.”

“Seeing that an Lizi had misunderstood, ye Zao was about to explain. ”

“CEN Shaoqing said calmly, “My surname is Cen.” ”

“Cen?”An Lizi frowned slightly. Could it be that this person was not ye Zao’s brother? “Then you and Zao Zao...”

“Cen Shaoqing, who had always been quiet, continued, “I’m friends with her.” ”

So it was just a friendship.

An Lizi nodded. Her gaze could not help but turn back and forth between ye Zao and Cen Shaoqing.

She had a strange feeling that these two people matched each other’s faces.

These two people definitely weren’t just friends.

The amusement park wasn’t too far from the city.

They arrived very quickly.

Ye Zhuo got out of the car and thanked them.

Cen Shaoqing’s tone was indifferent. “You don’t have to be polite with me.”

“Then we’ll go in first.”

“Go in.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

Cen Shaoqing stood where he was and watched them go in.

“An Lizi quietly turned around and looked at Cen Shaoqing. She tugged at ye Zao’s arm and asked, “Zao Zao, that Mr. Cen is quite handsome.” ”

“”Yeah, he’s not bad.”Ye Zao’s expression remained the same. ”

“An lizi continued, “Does he like you?” ”

“You’re thinking too much.”Ye Zao’s tone was shallow.

“”If he doesn’t like you, why did he send us to the amusement park! You Don’t even know how handsome he was when he said ‘get in the car, I’ll send you guys’Just Now! He’s practically the boss!” ”

“As an Lizi recalled the scene just now, stars were about to appear in her eyes. ”

She had read so many novels about the CEO of the company.

She had never felt that there was anyone more like the CEO of the company in reality than Cen Shaoqing.

Even some of the professional celebrities who acted as the CEO of the company did not have half of Cen Shaoqing’s aura.

That kind of innate aura of a superior was inadvertently emitted.

Others could not learn it at all.

Nor could they copy it.

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “He’s a vegetarian and believes in Buddhism. It’s impossible for him to fall in love with anyone. You! Don’t let your imagination run wild!” ”

Cen Shaoqing was already thirty-one years old.

“If there was someone he liked, he would have long been enlightened. ”

Why would he wait until now?

“Ye Zhuo had previously investigated Cen Shaoqing. Ever since he came of age, there had not been any special members of the opposite sex in his circle. ”
