“Although there was no food on Earth in Galaxy S, elder Bai had ordered people to prepare a lot of delicious food because Bai Jingshu liked it and Lin Ze was from Earth. ”

“In the past, Bai Mo wouldn’t even look at such low-level food. ”

“But now, it was different. ”

“For Lin Ze’s sake, even if she didn’t like it, she had to endure the nausea and pretend that she liked it. ”

She couldn’t let Lin Ze find out anything.

“She heard that ye Zao liked desserts. Lin Ze was ye Zao’s older brother, so his taste must be similar to ye Zao’s. With that thought in mind, Bai Mo picked up a piece of dessert and tasted it. Then, she looked at Bai Jingshu, “SIS, this piece of dessert tastes really good. Do you want to try it?” ”

Bai Mo knew that Bai Jingshu never ate anything that was too sweet. This sentence was also to create a distance between her and Lin Ze.

Bai Jingshu smiled and shook her head. “I have a fattening body. You Can Eat.”

“”Sister, you’re not afraid. What are you afraid of?”Bai Mo continued. ”

Bai Jingshu still shook her head.

“Bai Mo’s eyes hid a smug look. She turned to look at Lin Ze. “Brother-in-law, do you want to try?” ”

“She had thought that Lin Ze would gladly accept it. Unexpectedly, Lin Ze directly rejected her. “Thank you. I don’t really like to eat anything that is too sweet.” ”

Bai Mo was stunned.

Was Lin Ze still holding a grudge against her for what happened in the past?

Bai Mo’s eyes were filled with bitterness.

How could Lin Ze forgive her. It had been so long...

Bai Jingshu picked up a grape and handed it to Lin Ze. “Eat this.”

“”Okay.”Lin Ze took the grape, tore off the skin, and passed the sparkling and translucent fruit to Bai Jingshu. “Try it and see if it’s sweet.” ”

“It’s very sweet.”

“Seeing the two of them like this, Bai Mo felt extremely uncomfortable. ”

He was taking revenge on her.

Lin Ze was definitely taking revenge on her!

“Otherwise, Lin Ze would never have been so intimate with Bai Jingshu in front of her. ”

He and Bai Jingshu were not in love.

Bai Jingshu was just a substitute for her.

“If she were Bai Jingshu, she would have long found a hole to hide in. It was also because Bai Jingshu did not have good eyesight and could not even see through the act. She really thought that Lin Ze loved her! ”

What a joke!

“With that thought, Bai Mo felt a little better. He raised his head to look at the two of them, his eyes filled with determination. ”

Inside the house.

Old Master Bai looked at Bai Jingshu and Lin Ze with a smile on his face. He felt that Bai Jingshu didn’t marry the wrong person.

Bai Mo finished a dessert and walked outside. He took a deep breath.

She couldn’t admit defeat.

She couldn’t admit defeat!

She absolutely couldn’t lose to Bai Jingshu.

She wanted to see Bai Jingshu cry with a smile.

“After standing outside for a while, Bai Mo walked back into the house. The sweet smile on her face was still the same as before, “SIS, let’s go watch a movie after dinner. There’s a new blockbuster movie that’s very popular recently. I heard that the plot is pretty good too.” ”

The three of them were going to watch a movie?

Bai Jingshu raised her eyebrows without anyone noticing.

“Without waiting for her to speak, Lin Ze continued, “Your sister and I have already booked the tickets for the movie. If you want to watch it, you can ask third sister to accompany you.” ”

Bai Yuanyuan was the third eldest among the many sisters in the Bai family. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Now that Lin Ze was together with Bai Jingshu, it was only natural that he and Bai Jingshu would address Bai Yuanyuan as third sister. ”

What Lin Ze meant was to directly reject Bai Mo. .

Bai Mo was stunned when she heard this. She looked at Lin Ze with disbelief in her eyes.

She did not expect Lin Ze to reject her proposal.

She had already taken the initiative and regretted her actions. Was Lin Ze not satisfied?

What did Lin Ze want from her?

“Elder bai smiled and said, “Miss Mo, your sister and your brother-in-law just got married. It is indeed inappropriate for you to go with them. How about this? Call Yuanyuan over and ask Yuanyuan to go with you.” ”

Bai Mo nodded. “Okay.”

“Although she was smiling, she had already cursed elder Bai more than a hundred times in her heart. ”

That damned old man!

“Did he even know what first come, first served. ”

She was clearly the one who knew Lin ze first.

“Just because Bai Jingshu stole Lin Ze and married him, elder Bai had always been on Bai Jingshu’s side? ”

Bai Mo’s reaction was reflected in Bai Jingshu’s eyes.

It was impossible to say that she didn’t feel uncomfortable at all!

“After all, Bai Mo was her cousin. ”

“Fortunately, Lin Ze knew what was going on. Otherwise, she would have felt uncomfortable to death. ”

It was also fortunate that they would leave Galaxy S after their marriage.

Lin Ze also knew what was on Bai Mo’s mind. He turned to look at Bai Jingshu. “It’s a little stuffy in here. Shall we go out and get some air?”

“Yes.”White Jingshu nodded.
