“Man Wen in the room watched the back of the mother and daughter, one after the other, with a sarcastic smile on his face. ”

“Sometimes, he would also ask himself why he was born into such a strange family. ”

“He would rather be ordinary, even if he was just an ordinary person, living an ordinary life. ”

Unfortunately.

Things did not turn out as he wished.

...

China.

“Ye Zhuo checked Cen Shaoqing’s pulse, and his expression did not look good. ”

“How is it?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“Ye Zhuo continued, “According to the pulse, there is nothing wrong with your body. Everything is normal.” ”

“It was even more normal than a normal person. It just so happened that it was normal, reflecting the abnormality. ”

“Normal?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“Ye Zhuo frowned slightly and continued, “How about this, I’ll go to Your House tomorrow. Now, I have to go back and make some preparations, and then ye Han will leave tonight.” ”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “He’ll Leave Tonight?”

“”Yes, there are still a lot of things waiting for him to deal with in changyue.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing stood up and said, “Then I’ll go back with you.” ”

“His future brother-in-law was leaving at night. As his brother-in-law, he naturally had to send him off. ” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Okay.”

The two of them drove back to the Lin family home together.

“Old Lady Lin looked at the two of them through the small garden, the corners of her mouth full of smiles. ”

“What a perfect match. Back then, she was really blinded by a ghost, which was why she treated ye Zhuo like that. Now that she thought about it, other than regret, there was also regret. ”

Lin Ze was taking ye Han to watch a movie in the home theater.

“Although ye Han was on a planet with a higher level of civilization, he didn’t know much about Earth before this. As for the movie, it had long been eliminated by them. The people of the s system pursued a higher level of enjoyment. ”

But the so-called higher level of enjoyment was far less realistic than lying on the soft sofa and watching a movie.

“The higher the civilization of the planet, the more indifferent people became. ”

“After spending a few days on Earth, Ye Han already had a perfect plan for governing the country in his heart. ”

“”It seems that burning is back.”At this moment, Lin Ze suddenly sat up from the sofa. ”

“Ye Han asked curiously, “How did you know?” ”

Lin Ze glanced at him. “Didn’t you hear the voice?”

“No.”Ye Han shook his head. “Did you hear wrongly?”

“I definitely didn’t hear wrongly.”Lin Ze walked out. “I’ll go out and take a look.”

“I’ll go and take a look too.”Ye Han followed Lin Ze’s footsteps.

The two of them had just reached the hall when they saw ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing walking over together.

“Ye Han said in surprise, “Sis, you’re really back!” ”

“Yeah.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Ye Han looked at Lin Ze. “Brother Ze, you’re really amazing!”He had practiced martial arts for many years and had never heard ye Zhuo’s voice, but Lin Ze had heard it. ”

“Lin Ze smiled and said, “It’s just that my hearing is a little better than an ordinary person’s.” ”

Ye Han walked over to the two of them. “Mr. Cen is here too.”.

“Ye Zhuo said, “He knows that you’re leaving today, so he came to see you off.” ”

“Ye Han looked at Cen Shaoqing and continued, “Actually, there’s no need to make a special trip. I’ll come visit my sister often in the future.” ”

“Actually, these words were also a warning. ”

“He was telling Cen Shaoqing not to bully ye Zao. If he found out, he would definitely not let Cen Shaoqing off. ”

Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips parted slightly. “Welcome Home Anytime.”

“Ye Zao took out the takeout box and continued, “Brother, I packed your favorite crab roe buns for you.” ”

“”Thank you.”Lin Ze walked over, took the takeout, and looked at Ye Han. “Do you want to eat together?”? ”

“Ye Han hesitated for a moment, then nodded. “Yes.” ”

“In fact, when he first came to Earth, Ye Han still somewhat resisted the food on Earth. ”

Until...

“Lin Ze took him to eat at a street stall. From then on, Ye Han fell in love with the delicacies on Earth. ”

He didn’t even understand why the ancestors of the s galaxy wanted to eliminate the great invention of delicacies.

“Seeing that ye Han had changed so much, Ye Zhuo was also a little surprised. ”

“At night, after Lin Jincheng and Ye Shu returned, Ye Han bid them farewell and set off. ”

“Ye Zhuo looked at Lin Ze. “Brother, you should go too. Coincidentally, I have something to tell you.” ”

“Okay.”Lin Ze nodded.

Cen Shaoqing drove the group to the CEN family base.

“Lin Ze wasn’t surprised to see ye Han’s body shrink in front of the interstellar shuttle. Instead, he was exceptionally calm, as if she had expected it. ”

“The miniature ye Han stood inside the interstellar shuttle and greeted everyone. “SIS, brother Ze, Mr. Cen, Goodbye.” ”
