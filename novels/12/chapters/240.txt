“”God Ye, we’re about to graduate. I Can’t bear to part with you.” ”

“”God Ye, you can’t Forget Us the moment you graduate.” ”

“...”

The scene gradually became emotional.

“Ye Zhuo stood up with a smile. “There is no banquet that doesn’t end. Don’t worry, I will always remember everyone. I will always remember grade 12 Class 7. I wish us all the best in our exams and get into the ideal school.” ”

“Then, ye Zao took a photo with everyone in the classroom. ”

It wasn’t just the students from Class 7 who didn’t leave.

“The students from the other classes were also reluctant to leave and bid farewell to each other. After all, after today, it would be very difficult for the entire class to gather together. ”

“After nearly an hour, everyone finally left the classroom. ”

“An Lizi stood outside and waited for ye Zao and Zhao Pingting. When she saw the two of them coming over, an Lizi ran over excitedly. “Zao Zao, Pingting.” ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “Lizi, have you been waiting for a long time?” ”

“An Lizi shook her head. “No, our class just ended.” ”

The three of them walked and chatted along the way.

“As they chatted, the topic suddenly turned to the person they liked. ”

Zhao Pingting told an Lizi about the person she liked.

“An Lizi said, “I also have someone I like. I even made an agreement with him to go to the same university together.” ” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Zhao pingting said in surprise, “Really? What’s going on between the two of you? who confessed to whom?” ”

“An Lizi shook her head, “Neither of us confessed. We’ve known each other since we were young. But when we were fifteen, his parents moved to Beijing because of work. On the day we left, we made an agreement to wait for each other at Beijing University!” ”

“”I’m so envious of you, Lizi! I’ve never heard you talk about this before,”Zhao Pingting said enviously. ”

“An Lizi said, “We’re like brothers. He doesn’t know that I like him at all. But, as long as I can get into Beijing University, I’ll definitely break that window!” ”

“At this moment, Zhao Pingting suddenly pointed at a few male students not far away and said, “Zhuoluo, Lizi, look, that’s song Anbei!” ”

“Which one? Which One? Why don’t I See Him? Isn’t he handsome?”An lizi curiously looked in the direction that Zhao Pingting was pointing at.

“Zhao pingting said embarrassedly, “It’s, it’s the tall and thin one, the one with fair skin.” ”

“Ye Zho narrowed his eyes. “I see that they’re all tall and thin, and they’re not black either...” ”

Zhao Pingting’s face was a little red. “The one with the glasses.”

“An lizi asked, “The boy standing between them?” ”

“Yes.”Zhao pingting nodded.

“An Lizi patted Zhao Pingting on the shoulder and said meaningfully, “Good for you! Pingting! You have good taste! I feel that he looks quite like my idol...” ”

“Which idol?”Zhao Pingting asked curiously.

“As far as she knew, an Lizi had a lot of idols. It was almost as if she fell in love with one idol after being a fan of a drama. ”

“”It’s the idol who sang ‘between the mountains and rivers’!”As she said that, an Lizi hummed along and sang, “The rain of falling flowers, your swaying beauty. The fragrance of the flowers reminds me of my past love. I’m willing to turn into a duckweed and lie in the middle of the lake...” ”

“Hearing this, Ye Zao smiled and said, “I quite like him too.” ”

“An Lizi said excitedly, “This shows that we two heroes have the same thoughts! I’ve bought all of his albums. Zao Zao, have you bought them?” ”

Ye Zao nodded. “It’s about the same for me.”

“After saying that, an Lizi turned to look at Zhao Pingting. “Pingting, we’re going to the battlefield tomorrow. Don’t you want to confess to Him? I think the two of you are quite compatible!” ”

Zhao Pingting shook her head. “Forget it.”

She did not have the courage to confess.

What if she was rejected?

It would be too embarrassing!

“”If you’re embarrassed, I can help you get wechat!”An Lizi said. ”

“Zhao Pingting grabbed an Lizi’s hand. “Lizi, don’t do anything rash!” ”

“Seeing her like this, an Lizi said speechlessly, “Pingting, you’re usually quite brave. You’re not even afraid of cockroaches. I’m just going to get wechat. What are you afraid of? Let’s chat on wechat first. What if he falls in love with you after a long time?” ”

“When she said the idiom ‘love after a long time’, an lizi winked meaningfully at Zhao pingting. ”

“Zhao Pingting’s already slightly red face turned even redder at this moment. She pinched an lizi and said, “Lizi...” ”

“Ye Zhuo, who was beside her, was speechless. was there something wrong with falling in love after a long time? ”

“”Alright, Alright, I won’t Tease You Anymore!”An Lizi patted Zhao Pingting’s hand. “When you’ve thought it through, you can look for me anytime. I’ll help you ask for his wechat!” ”
