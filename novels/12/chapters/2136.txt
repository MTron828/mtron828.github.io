“”Mom, what about aunt?”Duanmu fengyu continued, “Can we ask Uncle for help?” ”

Mrs. Duanmu shook her head.

“It’s not a good time yet.”

“Then when is it?”Duanmu Fengyu asked.

Mrs. Duanmu narrowed her eyes. “You shouldn’t be the one to talk about this.”

“You mean…”

“Mrs. Duanmu continued, “We have to let Zhou Xiang talk about it.” ”

“Cen Haifeng had brought them to the s galaxy because he felt guilty. If Zhou Xiang was the one to talk about it, it would be twice the result with half the effort. ”

Duanmu Fengyu looked at Mrs. Duanmu doubtfully.

“”Your uncle is full of guilt toward Zhou Xiang. Men are all hypocrites. In order to compensate Zhou Xiang, he will definitely agree.” ”

Duanmu fengyu nodded.

“Mrs. Duanmu held Duanmu Fengyu’s hand and continued, “So, Fengyu, you must make good use of Zhou Xiang. Don’t look down on her just because she’s from Earth. Even if you look down on her, you must keep it in your heart.” ”

“Speaking up to this point, Mrs. Duanmu paused. “And that old lady from the Cen family. I’ve checked. She has a good temper and can be considered easy to get along with. You can be a little sweet-talker and fool her.” ”

“As long as she made good use of Zhou Xiang and the Cen family’s old lady, Duanmu Fengyu would not have to worry. ”

“Okay.”Duanmu fengyu nodded.

“”Don’t think too much. All the humiliation is only temporary,”Mrs. Duanmu continued. “The sun always shines after the storm.” ”

“Okay.”

“After persuading Duanmu Fengyu, Mrs. Duanmu left her bedroom. ”

Duanmu Liangchen waited outside the door. “How is it? Has Fengyu figured it out yet?”

“Mrs. Duanmu nodded. “Although Fengyu can be a little willful at times, she’s not a child who doesn’t know what’s good for her.” ”

“It’s all thanks to your teaching.”Duanmu Liangchen smiled apologetically.

“Although Duanmu Liangchen was pretty, he was smart. He knew who to offend and who not to offend. ”

“Xu Jingzhi was a very orthodox young lady from a prestigious family. She was well-read, sensible, and knew when to advance and when to retreat. She was a good wife and a good mother. If the Duanmu family was not her, they would probably not be in this state. Most importantly, Xu Jingzhi never cared about his affairs outside. No matter how wild he was, she would not even frown. ”

“Therefore, Duanmu Liangchen respected her and gave her enough face. ”

“They were all mutual. Since Duanmu Liangchen gave Xu Jingzhi his name, Xu Jingzhi naturally wouldn’t pick on Duanmu Liangchen anymore. ”

Mrs. Duanmu glanced at Duanmu Liangchen. “Have you dealt with that Ning ‘er?”

“She could tolerate Duanmu Liangchen having other people outside, but she absolutely wouldn’t allow anyone to flaunt their power in front of her! ”

That Ning ‘er had crossed her bottom line.

“”Don’t worry, everything has been taken care of!”Duanmu liangchen continued, “I promise that no one will dirty your eyes in the future.” ”

Mrs. Duanmu nodded.

“What about Feng Yu?”Duanmu Liangchen was afraid that his image in his daughter’s heart would plummet after his daughter saw such a thing.

“”I have already explained it to her,”Mrs. Duanmu said. ”

“”Okay, okay, okay.”Duanmu Liangchen nodded repeatedly. “Jingzhi, thank you.” ”

“Mrs. Duanmu said, “I’m tired. I’ll go back to my room to rest first.” ”

“Okay.”

On the other side.

Manxing country.

Manxing sat at his desk and listened to his assistant’s report. He raised his eyebrows slightly. “Are you saying that young master Dongli is going back to his country?”

“”It’s not just young master Dongli who is coming back.”The assistant continued, “It’s said that his fiancée is coming back with him.” ”

“Fiancée?”A glint flashed across man Xing’s eyes.

“”Yes,”the assistant said. “It’s young master Dongli’s fiancée on Earth.” ”

Man Xing narrowed his eyes.

Young Master Dongli wanted to bring his fiancée back.

“Then how should Duanmu Feng, who had always regarded herself as the fiancée of the young master of Dongli, handle herself? ”

This matter was really too interesting.

“Is this information reliable?”Man Xing raised his head.

“”Don’t worry, it’s absolutely reliable,”the assistant said. ”

“Okay.”

“At this moment, Man Wen’s voice came from outside. “Sis! Sis! Sis!” ”

“Hearing his voice, man Xing subconsciously frowned and turned to look at his assistant. “You can go out first.” ”

“Yes.”

The assistant walked out while man Wen walked in.

“The Moment Man Wen entered, he sat on man Xing’s office chair like an old man. “SIS, I want money.” ”

“MAN XING said, “Didn’t I just give it to you last time?” ”

“Hearing that, Man Wen was a little speechless and said, “It’s been so long. It’s hard for you to still remember it!” ”
