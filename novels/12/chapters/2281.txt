“Then who do you fancy next to me?”Bai Jingshu asked curiously.

“Bai jingfei continued, “Zhou Yuanman is not bad.” ”

“Zhou Yuanman was Bai Jingshu’s elementary school classmate. He had once chased after Bai Jingshu. When Bai Jingfei heard her words, Bai Jingshu frowned slightly. ”

It seemed a little inappropriate to introduce someone who had chased after her to her younger sister.

“”I know that Zhou Yuanman has courted you before. Don’t worry, I don’t mind. Besides, I don’t need you to promise me anything as long as you introduce Zhou Yuanman to me.”As she said this, Bai Jingfei’s expression became serious, “I really like Zhou Yuanman. Help me and let us get to know each other. You Don’t have to worry about the rest.” ”

Bai Jingfei was confident that she could handle that otaku Zhou yuanman.

Bai Jingshu hesitated for a moment and nodded. “Okay.”

“”Thank you,”Bai Jingfei said with a smile. ”

“Bai Jingshu continued, “We have a class reunion the day after tomorrow. Come with me.” ”

“”Okay.”Bai jingfei continued to ask, “What time is the day after tomorrow?” ”

“Ten o’clock in the morning the day after tomorrow.”

“”Okay, I’ll look for You Then.”Bai Jingfei stood up. “I’ll go to a beauty salon first. See You the day after tomorrow.” ”

“Go ahead.”

“Looking at Bai Jingfei’s back, Bai Jingshu sighed softly. ”

She didn’t know whether her decision was right or wrong.

“Soon, two days later. ”

Bai Jingfei arrived at the old residence as promised.

“Bai Jingshu was the class Belle when she was in school, so she was more popular among her classmates. ”

“Bai Jingfei looked a little like Bai Jingshu. After introducing Bai Jingfei.., everyone said jokingly, “Jingshu, you actually have such a good-looking sister hiding in your house. If you had brought her out earlier, I wouldn’t have been single for so long.” ”

“Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “My sister is still single. If you want to pursue her, you have to work harder.” ”

“As soon as she said that, everyone immediately started to jeer. ”

“Bai Jingfei was a person who knew how to stir up trouble. In less than an hour, she had already gotten into a heated argument with everyone. ”

Bai Jingshu did not interfere too much between her and Zhou Yuanman.

“Around 5:30 pm, the party ended. ”

Bai Jingfei went to sing with a few people while Bai Jingshu returned to the old mansion alone.

“Just like that, she accompanied her grandfather to stay in the old mansion for a few days before Bai Jingshu proposed to return to Earth. ” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Elder Bai naturally agreed. He then handed Bai Jingshu an extremely small chip and instructed, “A girl must protect herself no matter where she is. If she encounters any danger, activate this chip.” ”

“”Alright.”Bai Jingshu took the chip. “Sister, you must also take good care of yourself.” ”

“Elder bai chuckled and said, “Don’t worry about me. I’ll take good care of myself. It’s you, Lass, who isn’t as tactful as Jingfei in dealing with the world. That’s why I’m worried.” ”

Bai Jingshu’s personality was more Buddhist.

She wasn’t good at fighting.

She needed to be protected. Old Master Bai sincerely hoped that Bai Jingshu could find someone who could protect and love her as soon as possible.

“”Thank you, grandfather.”Bai Jingshu reached out and hugged old master Bai. ”

“Ever since she was young, it had always been her grandfather who protected her. ”

Her grandfather was her umbrella!

“”Silly child.”Old Master Bai chuckled and said, “Hurry up and leave. Bring back a grandson-in-law for me as soon as possible.” ”

“Okay.”Bai Jingshu nodded.

“After bidding old master Bai Farewell, Bai Jingshu went to the interstellar shuttle and set off for Earth. ”

“Bai Jingshu, who was still waiting at the Chen family’s side, personally came to negotiate with them. ”

“However, after waiting for a long time, Bai Jingshu still did not come to their door. ”

“This time, Chen Yaojun was a little anxious. ”

“Logically speaking, his prediction should not be wrong. ”

But how could Bai Jingshu not act according to common sense?

“Whether it was Chen Yaojun or the rest of the Chen family, they were also very anxious. ”

“Madam Chen frowned and said, “What exactly is going on with Bai Jingshu! Could it be that she doesn’t want to marry into our Chen Family?” ”

Chen Jinyan sighed. “The thing that I was most worried about still happened.”

“”Mom, what exactly happened that day? Was it Bai Jingshu who set yaosheng up, or yaosheng...”the rest was self-evident. ”

“”Nonsense! It must be Bai Jingshu who set yaosheng up on purpose! Yaojun, don’t you know what kind of person your brother is? How could he do such a thing?”Madam Chen never believed that her son would do such a disgusting thing, then she said, “Besides, with your brother’s condition, what kind of girl could he not find? Why does he have to force himself on that Little B * Tch, Bai Jingshu?” ”
