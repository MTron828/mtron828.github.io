“Chapter 971: 220: Slap on the face, ugly fish being tortured! 7”

Translator: 549690339

“[ it’s really disgusting, even lying to an old man! ] ”

“[ it’s fine if you lie to an old man, but she didn’t go back to Old Madam Song’s funeral last year. ] ”

[ it turns out that the Zhou family’s parents aren’t any good either. It’s really like dragons giving birth to dragons and phoenixes giving birth to phoenixes. Mouse’s son knows how to dig holes! ]

[ the whole net boycotted song Chenyu! ]

“[ sister upstairs, you are wrong. It should be Zhou Chenyu. ] ”

“Old Mrs. Cen was also sitting on the sofa and scrolling through Weibo. When she saw that song Chenyu had turned into a complete black, she was so happy that she slapped her thigh. “This is really retribution! I finally see this ugly fish with a box lunch!” ”

“After saying that, old Mrs. Cen looked back in confusion. “Xiangxiang, do you think I’m sick?” ”

“What’s wrong with you?”

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “I just slapped my thigh a few times, but it didn’t hurt at all. Just Like This!” ”

Slap!

“After saying that, old Mrs. Cen raised her hand and imitated Zhou Xiang. “It really doesn’t hurt! It’s So Strange!” ”

Zhou Xiang looked at Old Mrs. Cen. “Because you’ve always slapped my thigh.”

Old Mrs. Cen:”...”

She was most afraid of the sudden silence in the air.

On the other side.

“Ye Zhuo, an Lizi, and Zhao Pingting had made an appointment to go shopping together. ”

“It was October, and the weather in Beijing was already very cold. ”

“The leaves of the ginkgo trees on both sides of the road had turned golden yellow. Looking from afar, it looked particularly spectacular. ”

Ye Zhuo stood at the appointed spot and waited for the two of them.

“”Are You Yezi?”At this moment, someone recognized ye Zhuo. “I really like you in Country 2!” ”

Ye Zhuo raised his eyes slightly. The person who came was a short-haired girl with a backpack. “Thank you for liking me.”

“The short-haired girl continued, “Yezi, can you give me an autograph?” ”

“Sure.”Ye Zhuo nodded.

The little girl immediately took out a pen and a notebook from her school bag.

Ye Zao took the pen and notebook and signed his name on it.

“”Sign one for me too.”At this moment, a fair and strong arm appeared in ye Zao’s line of sight. ”

“Ye Zao had done things like signing on the arm and clothes many times. Writing was a breeze. In just a second, a handsome name was signed. ”

“This person’s arm was very white. The black font was printed on the arm, and the black and white were distinct. ”

It actually had an indescribable artistic beauty.

Ye Zhuo returned the pen to the little girl.

“”Thank you.”The little girl immediately thanked him. As she turned around, she even glanced at the man standing beside Ye Zhuo. ”

Damn!

So handsome!

Ye Zhuo raised his head slightly and saw a familiar profile. “Brother Song?”

“Song Shiyu smiled and said, “You Recognize me?” ”

“Ye Zhuo removed the wireless earpiece on his left ear. “I’m sorry, I really didn’t react just now.” ”

“Where are you going?”Song Shiyu continued to ask.

“Ye Zhuo replied, “I’m waiting for my friends.” ”

“Da Zhuozhuo!”

“Just then, an Lizi and Zhao Pingting ran over. ”

“Ye Zhuo looked back slightly. “Look, they’re here.” ”

Song Shiyu tilted his head and saw two young girls about ye Zhuo’s age running over.

“Ye Zhuo waved at them. “Lizi, Pingting.” ”

“”Big Zhuozhuo, you’ve been waiting for us for a long time, haven’t you?”Zhao Pingting asked. ”

“Ye Zhuo shook his head slightly. “No, I just arrived. Oh right, let me introduce you to my friend, Brother Song. Brother song, this is my cousin, an Lizi. This is my friend, Zhao Pingting.” ”

Song Shiyu nodded slightly. “Hello.”

“Zhao Pingting and an Lizi quickly greeted him. “Hello, Brother Song.” ”

“Song Shiyu turned to look at Ye Zhuo. “I have something to do, so I’ll be leaving first.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

Song Shiyu greeted an Lizi and Zhao Pingting before turning to leave.

“Looking at song Shiyu’s back, an Lizi said, “Da Zhuozhuo, what’s this brother song’s name? He’s quite handsome!” ”

“His name is song Shiyu.”

“Zhao pingting continued, “Not only is he handsome, his name is also quite nice. Does he have a girlfriend?” ”

“Ye zhuoluo teased, “You like him? I’ll Be Your Matchmaker!” ”

“Zhao pingting smiled and said, “This song Shiyu is obviously a business elite. I can’t hold him back. I was just curious and asked.” ”

“An Lizi nodded in agreement. “This kind of man deserves to be raised in a boudoir by a socialite! By the way, does he have a girlfriend? I’m quite curious too!” ”

Ye Zao shook his head. “No.”

People like song Shiyu were almost open to liking and accepting people.

An Lizi sighed. “I wonder what kind of girlfriend he’s looking for.”

On the other side.

Song Shiyu walked to a tattoo shop.

“”Sir, are you looking for a tattoo?” ”

Song Shiyu nodded.

The shop owner immediately handed a tattoo album to Song Shiyu. “This is a picture album. Take a look.”

“There’s no need to look.”

“Do you have your own design?”The shop owner asked.

“Yes.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“The shop owner put the tattoo album back and said, “Is it convenient for me to see what kind of design you want to tattoo? Because we can’t guarantee a 100% restoration of some of the designs.” ”

“Song Shiyu rolled up his sleeves, revealing a clean signature. ”

“Because it was an art form, the shop owner could only roughly see the outline of the word ‘Ye’. ”

“The shop owner smiled and said, “That’s easy, but are you sure you want to tattoo it on your arm?” ”

“”I’m sure,”song Shiyu said concisely. ”

“The shop owner reminded him, “The tattoo medicine in our shop is imported from abroad. Once it’s tattooed, it can’t be washed off. Why Don’t you think about it first?” ”

“There were many cases of young people who ended up breaking up because they had their girlfriend or boyfriend’s name tattooed on their arms, and their current boyfriend became their ex-boyfriend. In the end, they wanted to come over and wash their tattoos but were unable to do so. ”

Song Shiyu’s face was expressionless. “There’s no need to think about it.”
