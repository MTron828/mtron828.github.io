“Isn’t this delicious?”Cen Shaoqing quickly finished eating a lotus mist.

Ye Zao gave him a thumbs up. “As expected of someone who grew up eating grass!”

Cen Shaoqing just smiled and didn’t say anything.

“Seeing this scene, Zhou Jinbei felt that it was a little unbelievable. ”

“If he hadn’t seen it with his own eyes, who would believe that Cen Shaoqing, who was as cold as an iceberg, would have such a warm side. ”

“While he was shocked, Zhou Jinbei picked up a piece of snow pear and stuffed it into his mouth. ”

“”Jinbei, don’t you hate eating pears the most?”Zhou Xiang asked in surprise. ”

“Only then did Zhou Jinbei realize that he was holding a piece of pear. He continued, “After so many years, my taste has long changed. Sister, do you still remember what happened when we were young?” ”

“Zhou xiang smiled and said, “So that’s how it is. This snow pear was transported from Tangshan. I heard that it’s a rock sugar pear. It’s especially sweet. Eat more.” ”

“Okay.”Zhou Jinbei nodded.

The group chatted while eating fruits.

“At 9:30 pm, Cen Shaoqing sent ye Zao back. ”

“Sitting in the driver’s seat, ye Zao fastened his seatbelt and said, “I’m going to school. I’m going to the laboratory to do an experiment tomorrow.” ”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly and started the car.

“Ye Zao leaned against the back of the chair. At this moment, as if he suddenly remembered something, he took out a small black bag from his pocket. The thing in the bag didn’t look big, but it was heavy and separated by a bag, he really couldn’t guess what was inside. ” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly. “Uncle Won’t give me a gold ingot, right?” ”

“Looking at its shape and weight, it indeed looked like a gold ingot. ”

Cen Shaoqing held the steering wheel with both hands and opened his thin lips. “Open it and you’ll know.”

Ye Zao untied the belt and saw a colorful light coming from inside. He took the thing out and saw that it was a pink diamond that was bigger than a pigeon egg.

“Moreover, it was a rare collection-grade pink diamond. ”

Was this the gift that Zhou Jinbei had casually prepared?

“If it was meticulously prepared, what kind of luxurious item would it be? ”

Ye Zao had thought that it would be a gold ingot at most.

He did not expect it to be a rare pink diamond.

“Ye Zao said, “Uncle is too generous.” ”

Cen Shaoqing smiled. “Didn’t you give him a set of clothes as well?”

Clothes that could adjust the temperature.

Pink diamonds could be bought with money.

But limited-edition clothes could not be bought just like that.

“Ye Zhuo continued, “This pink diamond can buy a house full of clothes.” ”

“”We’re all family, there’s no need to be polite with him.” ”

“Ye Zhuo asked curiously, “What business does Uncle Do?” ”

“”Real estate,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

“”OH.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly and continued, “By the way, did you ask what happened to Auntie’s face?” ”

“”My grandfather hit it,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

“Your grandfather?”Ye Zhuo frowned slightly.

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “My grandfather is selfish and greedy. My mother is a little stupid and filial. It’s not strange for such a thing to happen.”

One of them was willing to fight and the other was willing to suffer.

Zhou Xiang was also someone who could not be helped.

“Cen Shaoqing wanted to control her, but it was not easy to do so. ”

“Hearing this, Ye Zhuo did not say anything more. ”

“She did not know the whole story, so she still did not make any comments. ”

...

On the other side.

At the CEN residence.

Zhou Jin went to the guest room to rest. Old Mrs. Cen came to Zhou Xiang’s room.

“Zhou Xiang was applying medicine on her face. “Mom, it’s so late. Aren’t you going to sleep?” ”

“”I can’t sleep.”Old Mrs. Cen walked over to Zhou Xiang and sat down. “Xiang Xiang, aren’t you going to tell me what happened to your face?” ”

“Zhou Xiang had been married to the Cen family for so many years, and this was the first time she had a face injury. ”

“”It’s okay. I’m fine now,”Zhou Xiang said. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “How did you promise me a few days ago? You said that you would learn to resist in the future. It’s only been a few days, and you’ve already forgotten about it! “You can’t do this. When I leave one day, Shaoqing and Yezi won’t have time to take care of the house. Won’t you be bullied to death by them?” ”

Old Mrs. Cen was worried to death for Zhou Xiang.

“She had said everything, but Zhou Xiang just wouldn’t listen. ”

“Zhou Xiang put down the ointment and said with a smile, “Mom, one of them is my dad, and the other is my mom. They won’t really hurt me. Moreover, I promise you that I will never let anyone do anything to harm Shaoqing and Zhuozhuo.” ”

She would shoulder everything by herself.

“Old Mrs. Cen sighed. “Then tell me, why did he hit you?” ”
