Translator: 549690339

“[ ... ... I hope that Lin Ze can take on the responsibility of being a father. Escaping is not the way ... I know that I was born low and was just an ordinary girl who could not be found even if I fell into the crowd. I am not worthy of young master Lin, but I am already pregnant with his child ! My Constitution is special. If I forcefully abort the child, I will never be able to have my own child in the future If he keeps running away like this, I can only use my own methods to defend my rights”

“When Buttface received this message, he didn’t reply immediately. Instead, he sent a screenshot to Lin Ze.”

“Brother Ze, Zhang Qingqing is looking for me”

Lin Ze happened to be online. He clicked on the picture and frowned slightly. Ignore her. Just block her

[ Okay. ] Dog two blacklisted Zhang Qingqing.

“Dog Two didn’t reply to her, so Zhang Qingqing was a little anxious. She continued to send wechat messages to dog two. As soon as she sent the message, the dialog box showed a prompt that said, “The other party has rejected your message.”.”

Zhang Qingqing couldn’t believe her eyes.

Blacklisted!

Dog Two had blacklisted her too!

Weren’t they afraid that she would expose this matter to the public?

“There was so much public opinion on the internet right now. Once this matter was exposed, no matter how powerful the Lin family was, they wouldn’t be able to end it!”

“A moment later, Father Zhang came over. “Qingqing, how is it?””

Zhang Qingqing shook her head.

“Father Zhang narrowed his eyes. “Alright! Since that’s the case, let’s wait for them to beg us! Lei Lei!””

“Zhang Lei jogged in from outside. “What’s wrong, Dad?””

“Contact your friend from the news agency and tell him to come over. Tell him that we have big news!”Father Zhang continued.

“”Alright!”Zhang Lei nodded and said excitedly, “I’ll contact him right away!””

“After saying that, Zhang Lei went to contact his friend from the news agency.”

“His friend from the news agency was very excited after hearing Zhang Lei’s words. If this matter were to be published, it would definitely be explosive news!”

“The Lin Corporation’s crown prince had raped a certain woman and caused her to become pregnant, but he was unwilling to take responsibility!”

“”Lei Zi, my results this year are entirely dependent on you!”Liu Pan continued, “Are you sure that what you said is true! ?””

“”The other party is my sister! Don’t tell me that I would use such a thing to lie to you? Liu Pan, if you don’t want to come, just say it. If worst comes to worst, I’ll go to other newspapers!””

“Hearing this, Liu Pan panicked and quickly said, “Come, come, come! Who says I’m not coming! I’ll be there right away! You must not call another news agency! I want to get the exclusive on this!”” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“”Okay!”Zhang lei continued, “Then hurry over!””

“Wait for me for ten minutes!”

“After hanging up the phone, Zhang Lei returned to Father Zhang’s side. “Dad, I’ve already called my friend. Are you sure you want to expose this matter?””

“”Since the Lin family isn’t sincere and doesn’t want to be responsible for your sister, then I can only make the first move!””

“Zhang Lei said with some worry, “If we do this, what if the Lin family is unhappy? After all, Qingqing is still going to marry into the Lin Family!””

“”Silly child! Do you really think that Qingqing can still marry into the Lin Family?”Father Zhang continued, “The Lin family now looks down on US and looks down on Qingqing. After this matter blows up, they will not allow Qingqing to marry into their family!””

“”Then why are we looking for reporters?”For a while, Zhang Lei’s mind was a little confused.”

“Father Zhang explained, “Your sister is pregnant with the Lin family’s child. If the Lin family doesn’t compensate us, we will not let it go!”The Lin family was a wealthy family. Regarding the compensation, Father Zhang had already thought about it! He had to compensate 1 billion!”

“Dad.”Zhang Qingqing turned to look at Father Zhang.

“”What’s Wrong?”Zhang Qingqing continued, “I want Lin Ze to marry me! I’m definitely going to be the young mistress of the Lin Family! So, no matter how much money they give you, can you compromise? !””

“The matter had already developed to this point. Even if Zhang Qingqing had to give everything, she had to marry into the Lin family in a glorious manner. She wanted Lin ze to kneel in front of her and beg her!”

Father Zhang frowned. “But...”

“”No buts,”Zhang Qingqing continued, “Getting the Lin family to give me some money is only a temporary benefit. If I can marry into the Lin family, it will be different! One person will attain enlightenment, and the whole family will ascend to heaven! So, father, you have to listen to me!””

So what if the Lin family found out about Wu Youyu’s existence?

Wu Youyu was already dead!

“Dead without a witness, they wouldn’t be able to find anyone to confront him.”
