Ye Zao Glanced at his friends list. They were either offline or in the game or in a team. “I don’t seem to be able to recruit anyone. What about you guys?”

“I don’t have anyone either...”

“Ye Zao continued, “Why don’t we just recruit anyone?” ”

“At this moment, an Lizi saw a message from a friend who was online. “Wait a minute, someone might be coming over.” ”

“Who is it?”Li Yueyue asked.

“”Song Shiyu,”an Lizi replied. ”

“Because of Ye Zhuo, an Lizi had played games with song Shiyu and added him as a friend. ”

“At first, song Shiyu could only play the entertainment bureau with them, but now, Song Shiyu was already a king. ”

She used to think that successful men never played games until she met Song Shiyu.

Song Shiyu was very different from other rich people.

“Li Yueyue immediately said, “Is he that handsome guy?” ”

“They had played games together before and had met before, so Li Yueyue had a deep impression of Song Shiyu. ”

“To be precise, she had no resistance against all handsome people. ”

Song Shiyu happened to be born in her aesthetic sense.

“”Okay.”An Lizi clicked on the invitation and did not forget to remind her, “I’ve already invited you. Yueyue, be careful of your image.” ”

“Okay!”

“At this moment, Song Shiyu accepted the invitation and joined the team. ”

“”Mr. Song, Can You Hear Me?”An Lizi asked. ”

“Yes.”Song Shiyu’s voice came from the other side.

“An Lizi continued, “Mr. Song, there’s no need for me to introduce you. YC is scorching. Please speak Mandarin and it’s scorching’s roommate, Li Yueyue. Chubby Chubby is my high school classmate, Zhao Pingting.” ”

“”We know each other,”song Shiyu said. ”

Song Shiyu had a good memory. He remembered that he had played games with them before.

“An Lizi said, “Zha Zha, let’s start.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zha clicked start.

“After disabling the three heroes, it was time to choose the heroes. ” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Can I play mage?”An Lizi continued.

“After playing king for so long, she was still the most skilled mage. ”

“Ye Zhuo was an all-rounder. He smiled and said, “I can do either. You guys choose first.” ”

“Zhao pingting said, “Then I’ll play ADC!” ”

“Li Yueyue continued, “I’ll play Princess Yaoyao protecting Little Luban.” ”

Yaoyao was Li Yueyue’s natal item. She did not need to do anything. She just needed to wait for Level 4 to use her shield.

Song Shiyu did not say anything. He silently chose to go up against a road hero.

“Ye Zao chose Na Kelulu to go wild. He looked at the lineup and said, “Yao, bring a distraction.” ”

“Li Yueyue asked doubtfully, “Bring a distraction for what?” ”

“She mostly brought healing and weakening to play with Yao, so she did not know how to use a distraction. ”

“Ye Zao said, “Just use a distraction when you’re over the tower.” ”

“”Okay,”Li Yueyue said. ”

“”Boss song.”At this moment, an unfamiliar male voice came from song Shiyu’s side. ”

Song Shiyu raised his head slightly and saw doctor Liu walking over.

Song Shiyu made a gesture of ‘silence’.

“Doctor Liu thought that song Shiyu was dealing with some important business, so he pushed him aside and waited for him. ”

Until the sound of a game came from the phone.

“Doctor Liu’s eyes flashed with surprise, and he even thought that he was hearing things. ”

Song Shiyu was playing King?

“”Kai, be careful of the old master.”At this moment, a pleasant female voice came from the phone. ”

“Like spring water, even though it was separated by the cold phone screen, it still made people’s eyes light up. ”

“”Okay,”song Shiyu said slowly. ”

“”Kai, don’t panic, I’m here to protect you!”An Lizi said with a smile. ”

“An Lizi was very good at playing the mage, so her support was also relatively timely. ”

“However, just as she went to confront the road, Little Luban walked elegantly to the Middle Road to eat the line. ”

“F * ck! Who told you to steal Daddy’s Line!”

Sounds came from the phone from time to time. Song Shiyu operated the phone with one hand and put on the headphones with the other hand.

“Just a moment ago, doctor Liu was still wondering if he was hearing things. How could third master song play games! ”

“But now, reality had struck him with such a blow! ”

“Who would have thought that third master song, who was usually more important than money, would suddenly play games? Moreover, he was playing with girls! ”

Doctor Liu was still unable to react in time.

“At this moment, Song Shiyu stood up and walked to doctor Liu’s side. He mouthed, “You can go back first.” ”

“Doctor Liu nodded, turned around, and left. He gently closed the door of the study. ”

This game lasted for more than three hours.

From 9 am to 12 am.

Ye Zhuo looked at his watch. “I’m going to eat. You guys can play.”
