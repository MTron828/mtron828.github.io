“Many years later, song Shiyu still remembered this scene. ”

“”Zao Zao, get in the car,”ye Sen called out. ”

“Coming.”Ye Zao put away his umbrella and sat in the car.

Ye Sen started the engine and left.

The black car slowly left after the car left for ten minutes.

“An hour later, Ye Sen and the rest arrived home. ”

“It was already past six o’clock when they arrived home, so ye Zao ordered takeout. ”

“While eating, Ye Sen had been holding his phone and giggling foolishly. ”

“Ye Zao asked curiously, “Uncle, what game are you playing? Why is it so funny?” ”

“Did I Laugh?”Ye Sen raised his head in surprise.

Ye Zao nodded. “Yes.”

Ye Sen touched the corner of his mouth. “Then you must have laughed.”

He was chatting with Bai Wei.

“He didn’t expect that Bai Wei, who looked like a very gentle girl, would be so funny when chatting. ”

Ye Sen had a good impression of her to begin with.

“After chatting with her tonight, his impression was even better. ”

Ye Sen continued to chat with Bai Wei.

“Ye Zao turned to look at Ye Shu and said in a low voice, “Mom, do you think that uncle is a little weird tonight?” ”

“It seems a little weird.”Ye Shu nodded. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

The next day was still the college entrance exam.

“Because he had chatted with Bai Wei for most of the night last night, when Ye Sen woke up this morning, there were two dark circles around his eyes. ”

“Ye Zhuo said, “Uncle, you didn’t have a good rest last night. You can rest at home today. Today, my mom and I will take a taxi to the exam venue.” ”

“”No!”! “How can I Do That!”Ye Sen said, “Today is the last day of the exam. I have to personally send you there. It’s just that I didn’t sleep well for one night. It’s nothing. When uncle was young, he used to play games all night. The next day, he would go to work as if nothing happened.” ”

“Ye Zao couldn’t persuade Ye Sen, so he just let him go. ”

9:30 A.M.-11:30 a.m. for the Science exam.

3:00 pm-5:00 pm English exam.

“In order to avoid meeting sister Lan, Ye Shu specially changed a place to wait for ye Zao today. ”

After finishing the last class.

It meant that the third year of high school was really over.

“The moment the examinees walked out of the exam room, their faces were relaxed, but they were not relaxed either. ”

“The third year of high school was gone, which meant that their youth was also over. ”

“”Mom, Uncle!” ”

Ye Zao jogged out of the Examination Hall.

“Zao Zao!”

“Ye Sen asked an old question, “How did Zao Zao Do Today?” ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “He did pretty well in the exam. It shouldn’t be a problem for him to get first place in the city.” ”

“Really?”Ye Sen was a little in disbelief.

First place in the city!

Top scorer!

Did that mean that he could get it just because he could?

It seemed a little strange!

Ye Zhuo nodded. “I think it shouldn’t be a big problem.”

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “Alright, Alright, let’s go back quickly! In order to celebrate the successful completion of the searing test, let’s have a big meal tonight!” ”

“As Ye Shu and ye Sen had never eaten a French meal before, Ye Zhuo found a French restaurant on the Internet that had a very high score and a very good environment. ”

“After finishing the French food, Ye Sen smiled and said, “The taste is quite good, but the portion is a little small. There are 21 dishes in total. I haven’t tasted them yet, and they are gone.” ”

“Ye Shu nodded. “The portion is indeed a little small, but in a restaurant like this, it’s all about the service and atmosphere. The portion and taste of the dishes are secondary.” ”

“”My mother is right,”ye Zao said. “Country F is famous for being romantic. This place is most suitable for couples to eat, so uncle, you have to work hard!” ”

“Ye Sen smiled and cooperated. “Wait, I’ll bring an aunt back for you at the end of the year.” ”

“Ye Zao waved his phone. “Uncle, I recorded just now. I’m waiting for you to bring an aunt back at the end of the year.” ”

It was already past nine o’clock when he returned home after eating his French meal.

“After taking a shower, ye Zao opened the live broadcast room and started the live broadcast. ”

“After not seeing ye Zao for two days, the fans were all very excited. ”

[ Ah Ah Ah! Ye Zao is back! ]

[ how did ye Zao do in the exam? ]

“”Don’t worry, I Won’t let you guys down.” ”

“[ user: Purple Gold Hammer 1225, giving out a sports car! ] ”

“[ user: that dog, giving out a sports car! ] ”

“Then, there was a pile of firecrackers and fireworks to give out gifts. ”

“Ye Zao unhurriedly logged into the game account and said, “Tonight, I’ll livestream chess for you guys first. After playing a game of chess, I’ll Livestream King.” ”

“As soon as he said this, Ye Zhuo saw a message pop up from the system. ”

[ layman scholar has sent you an invitation. ]

“Before ye Zhuo could say anything, the bullet screen became lively. ”

[ he’s Here! He’s Here! The unlucky guy is coming with his head! ]
