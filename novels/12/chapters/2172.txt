“After that, Zhao Dan never saw ye Zao again. ”

It was not until she saw ye Zao in the state of Changyue that she recognized that this was her daughter who had been missing for many years.

“In addition to ye Zao’s previous experiences, she was even more certain that ye Zao was her full moon. ”

“Back then, the full moon was only a little big, but in the blink of an eye, she had become a tall and graceful lady. ”

“The moment she recognized ye Zhuo, Zhao Dan was ecstatic. For more than ten years, she had thought that her daughter had died a long time ago, but she did not expect that not only was her daughter alive, but she was also the most honorable person in the country of changyue. She could stand shoulder to shoulder with the entire country! ”

She could not wait to ask ye Zhuo what had happened in the past few years.

She wanted to recognize ye Zhuo and his mother even more.

“However, ye Zao did not give her such a chance. When she went to the door and took the initiative to get in touch with Ye Zao, Ye Zao ridiculed her. ”

“Later, ye Zao even set up the Zen position to make them think that she had been betrayed by Ye Han! ”

Everything that ye Zao did made Zhao Danhan’s heart skip a beat.

They were supposed to be extremely close mother and daughter!

“Since ye Zhuo did not treat her as a mother, there was no need for her to save face for ye Zhuo. ”

“With this in mind, Zhao Dan continued, “There is only one path that ye Zhuo has in front of her. She is quite smart, choosing the easiest path to take.” ”

“What do you mean?”Man Jiangshan asked in confusion.

“Zhao Dan explained, “When the paternity test is done, Ye Zhuo can be said to have mistaken her parents for her. She took the opportunity to apologize to us. After all, before the paternity test is done, no one knows who is lying.”To Ye Zhuo, the paternity test report was her way out. ”

“After all, these things had already happened. If ye Zao stepped out to apologize at this time, would the people of Galaxy S pay the bill? ”

Of course not!

“Therefore, Ye Zao had to wait for the results of the paternity test to come out before he would apologize with tears streaming down his face. ”

“Hearing this, man Jiangshan nodded. It had to be said that Zhao Dan’s analysis was quite reasonable. ”

“”Dad, Mom.”At this moment, man Xing walked in from outside the door. ”

“”Xing ‘er.”Man Jiangshan raised his head. His eyes were full of love, and his attitude was completely different from when he saw man Wen. ”

“Man Xing walked in. “Dad, Mom, this is the nutrient solution that I just developed. Try It and see how it tastes.” ”

“After saying that, man Xing took out two bottles of beautifully packaged nutrient solution and handed them to man Jiangshan and Zhao Dan. ”

The couple took the nutrient solution and took a sip.

The nutrient solution developed by man Xing was not as astringent as the previous nutrient solution. It had a refreshing taste and a faint floral fragrance.

“Without waiting for man Xing to speak, Zhao Dan said in surprise, “The taste is very good! Xing ‘er, you are too amazing!” ”

“MAN XING smiled and said, “Actually, my inspiration came from elder sister. Recently, a fruit-flavored nutrient solution was popular in changyue, but because it was too popular, it couldn’t be supplied to other planets for the time being. So, I wanted to try and see if I could develop a similar one. “But I didn’t want to overlap with elder sister’s fruit flavor, so I developed this kind of floral fragrance.” ”

“”Who does she think she is!”Zhao dan continued, “Xing ‘er, you’re so outstanding. I believe that even without her, you can still develop it!” ” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Man Xing was many times better than ye Zhuo.

“However, man Xing didn’t have ye Zhuo’s good luck. He caught the good opportunity to pacify Changyue and become the respected Miss Ye. ”

“If it was man Xing, he would only be more outstanding by ye Zao! ”

“MAN XING smiled and said, “Mom, you’re flattering me too much. By the way, I heard that you and eldest sister will have a court session on Friday, right?” ”

“Yes.”Zhao Dan nodded.

“MAN XING continued, “Mom, can we not have a court session? Once the court session starts, eldest sister will really have no way out.” ”

“Zhao Dan looked at man Xing, he said somewhat speechlessly, “What time is it now? Xing ‘er, you’re still speaking up for her. “Let me tell you, it’s useless no matter who tries to persuade her about this matter. Since she doesn’t acknowledge me, I’ll take out the weapon of the law and let her shoulder the responsibility!” ”

“MAN XING sighed, “Then you must promise me that when elder sister returns home, you and father must treat her well and make up for her. After all, she suffered so many years outside.” ”

“”Okay, okay, okay. Don’t worry.”Zhao dan smiled and said, “No matter how bad she is, she is still your father’s daughter and mine. We won’t give her any face.” ”

“Man Xing nodded. “Mom, thank you. I believe that elder sister will definitely understand you and dad.” ”
