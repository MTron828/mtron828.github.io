“”Okay,”Ye Sen said to President Wang and then sent ye Zhuo and Gu dening out.”

President Wang stood at the same spot and narrowed his eyes.

The three of them came to the door. Ye Sen held the door like a gentleman and let ye Zhuo and gu dening go out first.

“Gu dening was wearing a pair of high heels. When she went down the stairs, she accidentally twisted and was about to fall. One of her hands quickly grabbed her arm and the other held her waist. “Are you okay?””

“Gu dening was still in shock. With Ye Sen’s help, she stabilized her body. “Thank you, Mr. Ye. I’m fine.””

“”It’s good that you’re fine.”Seeing that gu dening had stabilized herself, Ye Sen let go of her arm.”

There was a moment of subtlety in the atmosphere.

Ye Zhuo looked back slightly and just happened to see the blush on Gu Dening’s ear.

“After sending the two of them to the parking lot, Ye Sen returned to the restaurant.”

CEO Wang was still standing there waiting for him.

“CEO Wang.”

“CEO Wang looked outside the door. After a moment, he turned back to look at ye Sen. “CEO Ye, was that Doctor Gu a friend of your niece? Why do I feel like I’ve seen her somewhere before?”?”

“Ye Sen smiled and said, “Then you must have seen her on TV.””

“”On TV? !”CEO Wang said in disbelief, “So this doctor Gu is the Doctor Gu who cured cancer?””

“Although president Wang felt that gu dening was a bit like the Doctor Gu who cured cancer, he didn’t dare to confirm it.”

“After all, Gu Dening was too pretentious.”

How could ordinary people know her?

“Yes.”Ye Sen nodded. “She is the Doctor Gu who cured cancer.”

“President Wang suppressed the shock in his heart and continued, “President Ye, how old is your niece this year?””

“”Nineteen,”ye Sen answered.”

Only nineteen years old!

President Wang was stunned again.

“Gu Dening’s identity was not ordinary to begin with. For ye Zao to be able to make friends with Gu Dening, he must not be a simple person.”

“President Wang continued, “Then your niece must be very powerful too!””

“Ye Sen was willing to listen to others praise ye Zao. He said with a proud look, “Don’t tell me, my niece is indeed powerful! She is also the largest shareholder of Shengdong Express! If it weren’t for her, there wouldn’t be Shengdong Express Now!””

“”Really?”President Wang said in surprise, “Then what does your eldest niece know?””

“Ye Sen said, “My eldest niece Knows Everything!”” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Knows Everything?

President Wang felt that Ye Sen’s words were a little too much.

“A nineteen-year-old girl, no matter how amazing she was, could not know everything.”

“President Wang did not continue the topic and continued, “President Ye, to tell you the truth, my mother has been suffering from cancer for half a year. I wonder if you can help introduce her to doctor Gu?””

“Although there was already a treatment plan for the cancer, because there was no cure before this, there were too many patients piled up. Currently, there were still many people waiting in line for treatment.”

“Ye Sen said, “Doctor Gu and my niece are friends. I’m not too familiar with her, but I can help you ask her through my niece. If she agrees, I’ll arrange for you to meet her.””

“”Then I’ll have to trouble you, President Ye.””

“”It’s just a matter of one sentence,”ye sen continued, “But President Wang, I can only help you ask. I Can’t guarantee whether doctor Gu will agree or not.””

President Wang looked at ye Sen. “I know that. I’m already very grateful that you can help me set up a meeting.”

...

At the Lin family home.

Feng Qianhua waited until one o’clock in the afternoon before Old Mrs. Lin woke up.

“As soon as she opened her eyes, she started coughing violently.”

“Feng Qianhua hurriedly passed the health-preserving soup to her. “Auntie Lin, you’re awake. Hurry up and finish the soup.””

“Old Lady Lin took the soup and drank it all in one go. After she finished it, she wiped her mouth with a longing look, “Qianhua, it’s been hard on you. You’ve come over every day to bring me health-preserving soup. If you hadn’t come over every day to bring me soup, I really don’t know how I would have been able to endure for the past ten years...””

Old Lady Lin’s illness usually seemed fine.

“But once it flared up, her chest would feel stuffy and she would cough non-stop. It was as if her bones were being gnawed by ants.”

It was very uncomfortable.

This health-preserving soup was Old Lady Lin’s life.

“”It’s not hard. It’s what I should do.”Feng Qianhua picked up a tissue and wiped old lady Lin’s mouth, then, she said, “Oh right, Aunt Lin, su ran contacted me this morning. She said that if fourth brother didn’t have that kind of intention towards her, their family would have to arrange for her to meet other blind dates. When do you think you can arrange for fourth brother to meet su ran?””
