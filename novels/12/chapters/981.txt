“Cen Shaoqing:”...”how should he explain to Ye Zhuo that his voice had changed not because it was too cold, but because it was too ‘Hot’? ”

“Ye Zhuo turned to look at an Lizi and Zhao Pingting. “Lizi, Pingting, should we go back now or go shopping?” ”

Zhao Pingting yawned. “Why don’t we go back first? It’s getting late.”

An Lizi nodded. “I think Pingting is right.”

It was mainly because an Lizi was too annoying to he ziteng.

“Then let’s go home.”

Ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing drove back.

“He ziteng did not drive over. Instead, he sat in the backseat and stretched his head out to chat with Cen Shaoqing. “Fifth brother, I just heard you call an Lizi Cousin?” ”

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing said concisely.

He did not feel that this was anything embarrassing.

“He ziteng smiled and said, “Then, if anyone manages to woo an Lizi, wouldn’t that make them your brother-in-law?” ”

“Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “Theoretically speaking, that’s the case.” ”

“He ziteng continued, “Then what do you think of Me?” ”

Cen Shaoqing glanced at he ziteng through the rearview mirror. “You want to woo my cousin?”

He ziteng nodded without hiding it.

“To be more precise, he wanted to be Cen Shaoqing’s brother-in-law. ”

“He ziteng continued, “Fifth brother, do you support me pursuing your cousin?” ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “Of course I support you. I remember that it was your idea to help me Woo your fifth sister-in-law.”

“He ziteng smiled embarrassedly. “It’s been so long. Fifth Brother, do you still remember it?” ” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“”Some favors should be remembered for the rest of your life.”CEN Shaoqing continued, “Let’s not talk about other things. You are indeed talented in chasing girls!” ”

He ziteng was praised so much by Cen Shaoqing that he could not even find his bearings.

“In his impression, Cen Shaoqing was a person who would not easily praise others. ”

“But today, Cen Shaoqing was so abnormal. ”

It must be because he was too outstanding!

“After all, if it wasn’t for him, Cen Shaoqing wouldn’t have been able to chase after ye Zhuo so quickly. ”

It was all because he was giving Cen Shaoqing advice.

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “Ziteng, do you still remember what girls like?” ”

“Ah?”He ziteng was stunned.

“Cen Shaoqing returned to he ziteng exactly what he ziteng had taught him back then, “Girls always say what they mean. They’re used to saying what they mean. When they say they like something, they mean they don’t like it. When they say they don’t like it, they mean they like it.” ”

“Hearing this, he ziteng’s eyes lit up. “So when an Lizi said that she doesn’t like me liking millennium younger brother, she’s saying the opposite of what she meant?” ”

Cen Shaoqing furrowed his brows without leaving a trace. “You told her tonight that you’re going to pursue her?”

“That’s right.”He ziteng nodded.

“He ziteng suddenly understood, “Oh!”! I get it now. Girls are very reserved and shy. An Lizi must have fallen in love with me at first sight, but it was hard for her to say it out loud. So, she used the excuse that she liked Qianxi’s younger brother. In fact, she doesn’t like Qianxi’s younger brother at all. The person she really likes is me!” ”

“He was tall and strong, charming and suave, and handsome. It was normal for an Lizi to like him. ”

“If he was a woman, he wouldn’t be able to resist his handsomeness! ”

“The more he thought about it, the happier he ziteng became. He was deeply immersed in his own fantasies. ”

Cen Shaoqing:”...”why was he so stupid to listen to he ziteng’s words in the first place?

“If it wasn’t for he ziteng, he wouldn’t have taken such a detour. ”

“Fortunately, the heavenly axiom had a cycle of reincarnation, and retribution wasn’t pleasant. ”

Cen Shaoqing narrowed his eyes.

“After a long while, he ziteng finally walked out of his fantasy and turned to Cen Shaoqing, “Fifth brother, I think since an Lizi is too embarrassed to say it, I’ll tell her first. Anyway, I’m a man, so it doesn’t matter if my skin is thicker! Don’t you think so?” ”

“”I think what you said is very right,”Cen Shaoqing opened his thin lips, he continued, “When you confess, remember to prepare more pink lipstick and pink dress. Girls like these the most. When I gave these things to your fifth sister-in-law back then, she was so happy!” ”

She was so happy that she almost beat him half to death.

“He ziteng patted his chest and said with a smile, “Don’t worry, Brother Five, I know what to do! I was the one who told you about these things!” ”

He ziteng was very experienced in chasing his wife.

“Otherwise, he would not have helped Cen Shaoqing to chase after ye Zhuo so smoothly back then. ”

How difficult it was to chase after Ye Zhuo!

“But with his help, Cen Shaoqing still managed to chase after Ye Zhuo. ”

This showed that he was powerful.

“Cen Shaoqing recalled the detours he had taken in those years, he continued, “Also, when you go shopping and eat with girls, if they say that they don’t like it, you must remember that they are speaking the truth. If at this time, you order what they really want to eat in their hearts, they will be very happy!” ”
