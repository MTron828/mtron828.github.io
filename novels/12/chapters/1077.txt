“Okay!”Cen Jiang nodded and jogged over to get something for Ye Zhuo.

“A moment later, Cen Jiang came over with the precision welding machine. “Miss Ye, here.” ”

“Ye Zhuo took the welding machine, put on his goggles, and walked inside. ”

“Cen Hu looked at Tang mi beside him in surprise. “Miss Ye, are you going to do it yourself?” ”

“I think so.”Tang mi nodded.

“While she was speaking, ye Zao had already taken the welding tool in his hand and started to operate it. ”

“She was wearing a pair of goggles and was half-squatting there. Sparks flew from the welding, but there was not a single trace of fear on her. ”

Every welding position was accurate to 0.001 millimeters. Even the advanced welder was amazed.

Zhou Gong looked at her and narrowed his eyes. His nervous heart instantly calmed down.

He had a feeling that ye Zhuo would definitely lead them to build an aircraft carrier that would shock the whole world!

Zhou Gong was instantly full of confidence!

“After ye Zhuo finished welding a point, he told the welder about his experience. ”

More than twenty senior welders listened very seriously!

“”Team leader Cen Jiang.”At this moment, the assistant walked to Cen Jiang’s side. ”

“What’s Wrong?”Cen Jiang turned his head to look.

“The assistant continued, “Yu Zifei wants to see you.” ”

“Yu Zifei?”Cen Jiang frowned. “Is it old Nie’s disciple?”

“Yes.”The assistant nodded.

“Cen Jiang continued, “Did he say what it is?” ”

“He didn’t say.”

“Cen Jiang Thought for a moment, then turned around to say something to Cen Hu. He then followed his assistant to the construction warehouse. ”

“Yu Zifei was waiting outside the construction warehouse. When she saw Cen Jiang coming over, she immediately went up to him and said, “Team leader Cen Jiang.” ” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Because of old NIE’s matter, Cen Jiang didn’t have a good expression towards Yu Zifei. “Why are you looking for me?” ”

“Yu Zifei said, “Team leader Cen Jiang, I want to join Miss Ye’s research team.” ”

“Cen Jiang was stunned. “The two of you are quite interesting. One chickened out at the last minute, and the other applied to join at this time...”speaking up to this point.., cen Jiang paused for a moment before continuing, “Who knows what kind of shameful ideas the two of you are planning!” ”

“Cen Jiang had a very good impression of old nie and his disciple in the past. Ever since Old Nie’s ‘betrayal’, Cen Jiang’s influence on old Nie had plummeted. ”

A normal person would not do such a disgusting thing!

“Yu Zifei continued, “Team leader Cen Jiang, I want to join Miss Ye’s research team. There will be a press conference tomorrow. I want to contribute to the research team. Please give me a chance.” ”

Cen Jiang Sized Up Yu Zifei from head to toe.

“Yu Zifei generously let Cen Jiang size him up, he said sincerely, “Team leader Cen Jiang, teacher Nie’s actions were indeed his fault, but I’m me, and teacher Nie is teacher Nie! Team leader Cen Jiang, please let me join the research team!” ”

Cen Jiang narrowed his eyes. “Aren’t you afraid that Miss Ye will disappoint you?”

“I believe in Miss Ye!”

“Cen Jiang nodded. “Alright, even if you believe in Miss Ye, what if Miss Ye really can’t build an aircraft carrier? After two years, it’ll be a futile effort. What are you going to do? Aren’t you afraid of being implicated by Miss Ye?” ”

“”Then I won’t regret it either!”Yu Zifei said very seriously. “Since I chose to believe in Miss Ye, I’ll never regret it! In this life, I have to go crazy for myself once!” ”

“Although so far, more than 200 countries around the world had failed to build an aircraft carrier, Yu Zifei believed in ye Zhuo! ”

“Even if ye Zhuo really couldn’t build an aircraft carrier, he wouldn’t regret it! ”

Yu Zifei was fortunate enough to watch the live broadcast of last year’s science and technology competition.

He knew how powerful ye Zao was.

“From then on, he became a member of the NIU Hulu family. ”

“Now That Ye Zao’s research team was short of manpower, as his son, he naturally couldn’t just stand by and watch! ”

“Are you sure?”

“Yes! I’m sure!”Yu Zifei’s gaze was firm.

Cen Jiang glanced at Yu Zifei. “Wait here. I’ll go ask Miss Ye.”

“Yu Zifei was, after all, old Nie’s disciple. ”

What kind of good disciple could old nie produce if he went back on his word?

What If ye Zhuo wasn’t willing to let Yu Zifei join the research team?

“Normally, Cen Jiang wouldn’t even bother to ask. He hated people who went back on their word the most in his life. But now, the research team had suddenly lost more than 20 researchers. It was a time of shortage, the press conference was going to be held tomorrow, and the other members of the base were avoiding the scientific research group! ”

“At this time, they couldn’t care less. ”
