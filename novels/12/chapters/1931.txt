“What happened to Team Leader Yu?”Li Xiang turned around.

“Yu Zifei continued, “Did you manage to get through your parents’work?” ”

“Li Xiang was an only child. When Li Xiang was in trouble, Li Xiang’s parents were close to breaking down. ”

“At that time, Li Xiang’s mother had said that she wanted Li Xiang to resign. Now, Li Xiang had requested to return to work. If his parents did not agree, it would not end well. ”

“”Don’t worry, it’s done.”Li Xiang continued, “My parents are very supportive of me now and understand me.” ”

“That’s good.”Yu Zifei nodded.

“A moment later, Li Xiang knocked on the door and entered ye Zhuo’s office. ”

“After returning from the base, it was already past three o’clock in the afternoon. ”

Today was the New Year’s Eve.

The people who were out on the run had all returned home for the New Year. There were not many people on the road.

“As soon as they returned home, they felt a strong sense of the new year. ”

Red Lanterns were hung everywhere inside and outside the Lin family. Red couplets were pasted on the doors.

“Zhuozhuo is back!”Ye Langhua came out to welcome her.

“Ever since she met Ye Shu, ye Langhua had spent the new year with Ye Shu every year. ”

It was also after she met her daughter that ye Langhua felt the joy of the New Year.

“Usually at this time, she would sit at home and cry silently. ”

“Grandma.”

“Ye langhua smiled and said, “Just now, your mother was talking about you! What do you want to eat for the New Year’s Eve Dinner?” ”

“Ye Zhuo thought for a moment and said three dishes, “Boiled cabbage, Yangzhou lion head, and spicy and sour radishes.” ”

“”Okay, I’ll go tell your mother right away,”ye Langhua said. ” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Where’s My Brother?”Ye Zhuo continued to ask.

“Ye Langhua said, “He’s helping your mother in the kitchen.” ”

“I’ll go and take a look too.”

“Lin Ze was not a boy who worked in the kitchen, but as long as ye Shu went to the kitchen, he would go and help her. ”

He cherished every second he spent with his mother.

“On the eve of the Lunar New Year, Ye Shu discussed with Lin Jincheng and gave the servants and chefs a break to go back and reunite with their families. ”

“In the kitchen, Ye Shu and Lin Ze were busy. ”

“”Dad, Mom, Brother!”Ye Zao rolled up his sleeves and walked over. “I’m here to help you.” ”

“Go back and rest. I don’t need your help here. Your brother and Dad are enough!”

“Lin Jincheng said, “Your mom is right. The kitchen is smoky. Go out quickly.” ”

“Lin Ze was rolling the skin of the dumplings. “Zao Zao, just tell me what kind of fillings you want to eat.” ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “I want to eat shrimp fillings. Remember to add more shrimp.” ”

“”Sure, no problem.” ”

The whole family worked hard for the whole afternoon before they finished making a table full of dishes.

“When it was time for New Year’s Eve dinner, Ye Sen hadn’t come over yet, so ye Shu asked ye Zao to give him a call. ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “I just contacted uncle. Uncle said that he will come back soon after discussing a collaboration.” ”

“Hearing that, Ye Shu said with some disdain, “What time is it? You’re still busy discussing a collaboration! No wonder you’re still single!” ”

Ye Shu thought that ye Sen would definitely be able to get together with Gu Dening. She did not expect that the two of them had not made any progress until now.

“Because of this, Ye Shu was extremely anxious! ”

“Seeing that another year had passed and Ye Sen had aged another year, what was the meaning of this delay? ”

“Half an hour later, Ye Sen came with a bunch of New Year’s goods. ”

“Ye Shu said, “You brought so many things back to your own home! Do you have too much money to spend?” ”

“”I bought them for the children,”ye sen continued, “Sister, did you know that the ban on setting off fireworks has been lifted in our city?” ”

“Hearing this, Ye Shu was also a little surprised, “Really?” ”

“Ye Sen nodded. “Of course it’s true! The higher-ups just issued a notice. My goodness, when I went to buy firecrackers and fireworks, there were more than one person! I almost didn’t manage to buy them!” ”

On the other side.

Changyue country.

“Qiu Di stood in the detention room and looked at Yi Ling who was locked in the sealed space. Her gaze was sinister as she said, “Yi Ling, do you have to go against me?”After such a long time, she had tried every method, but Yi Ling was still unwilling to acknowledge her as her master! ”

“Seeing that the day of the general election was getting closer and closer, how could Qiu di continue to wait! ”

She had to take the initiative to attack and Make Yi Ling acknowledge her master!

“”Bad Woman! You’ve finally revealed your Fox Tail? Why aren’t you pretending anymore?”After a long period of torture, Yi Ling looked very weak. “Let me tell you, I will never betray Miss Ye!” ”

Qiu Di narrowed her eyes. “A wise man submits to circumstances. Don’t regret it! Don’t think that I really can’t deal with you!”
