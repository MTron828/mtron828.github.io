Chapter 2432: 510: apply to the leader! 1

Translator: 549690339

“Cen Shaoqing liked quiet. He did not like noisy places, especially crowded places. ”

“Therefore, every time he went to a scenic spot, he would take a private car or a helicopter. ”

“However, since it was ordered by the leader, he naturally had to listen to the leader’s wishes. ”

“Then what Time Shall We Leave Tomorrow?”Cen Shaoqing continued to ask.

Ye Zhuo thought for a moment. “Let’s go early. How about going out at eight?”

“During the days of vacation, Ye Zhuo slept until he woke up naturally every day. It was already very early for him to set off at eight. ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “Sure.”

“After saying that, CEN Shaoqing continued, “What do you want to Eat Tonight? I’ll make some arrangements.” ”

“OH.”Ye Zhuo was eating dessert. “Anything is fine. I’m very easy to feed. I’m Not Picky.”

Cen Shaoqing picked up the Buddha beads on the table. “Then I’ll go to the kitchen to have a look.”

“Go ahead.”

The specialties of the South China Sea were seafood and coconut chicken.

“Thinking that ye Zao had not eaten authentic Sichuan cuisine for a few days, he ordered the kitchen to cook some boiled fish and other dishes in the evening. ”

“After instructing the kitchen, Cen Shaoqing came to the room. Ye Zao was still lying on the bed reading a book. ”

“”You’re back,”ye Zao said. ”

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “I just received a call. I might not be able to accompany you to dinner tonight.”

“”You go ahead.”Ye Zao continued, “Have you arranged dinner?” ”

“”It’s all arranged.”Cen Shaoqing picked up the watch on the table and put it on. He also picked up the Buddha beads. The wine-red tassels circled around his fingers, looking indescribably beautiful. ”

“In the blink of an eye, Ye Zao’s line of sight fell on his fingers. He continued, “Let me take a look at the Buddha bead.” ”

Cen Shaoqing handed the Buddha bead to ye Zao.

“Cen Shaoqing had been holding the Buddha bead of a suitable size in his hand. When he held it in ye Zao’s hand, it seemed to have grown in size in an instant. It made her hand look indescribably slender and fair, soft as if it had no bones. ”

The small leaf rosewood emitted a faint fragrance.

“Perhaps because it had been worn for a long time, the surface of the Buddha bead had been polished to a luster. ”

“Where did you buy this string of Buddha Beads?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“CEN Shaoqing said, “A master gave it to me.” ”

“”OH.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “It must be a few years old, right?” ”

“”More than ten years,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

“After saying that, CEN Shaoqing continued, “You Like It?” ”

“”If I like it, are you willing to give it to me?”Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly. ”

“”I won’t send you off,”Cen Shaoqing said in a low voice. ”

“Cen Shaoqing suddenly changed the topic. “After all, my entire being is yours.” ”

“Ye Zhuo chuckled. “Mr. Cen, you’re really getting better at talking.” ”

Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips parted slightly. “The leader has taught you well.”

“Stop being so naive. Let’s go.”Ye Zao returned the Buddha bead to Cen Shaoqing.

“Didn’t you like it?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“Ye Zao stuffed the Buddha bead into Cen Shaoqing’s hands. “A gentleman doesn’t take away what others like. Besides, I don’t have the hobby of becoming a monk.” ”

Cen Shaoqing took the Buddha bead. “Then I’ll be leaving first.”

“Go ahead.”Ye Zao stood up and sent him out. “Can you come back tomorrow?”

“I can come back tonight.”

“Okay.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“As soon as he said that, ye Zao seemed to have thought of something. “Wait!” ”

“What’s Wrong?”Cen Shaoqing stopped in his tracks.

Ye Zao picked up a bottle of sunscreen. “The sun outside is very poisonous. I’ll put some sunscreen on you.”

“Could it be that the temperature was not high, but because it was too close to the equator, the sunlight was very harsh. Because of this, the temperature difference in the South China Sea region was very big sooner or later. ”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“”Sit down,”ye Zao said. ”

Cen Shaoqing immediately sat down on the chair.

Ye Zao Bent down slightly and applied sunscreen to Cen Shaoqing. “Close your eyes.”

“OH.”Cen Shaoqing immediately closed his eyes.

“His eyelashes were very long and thick. When he closed his eyes, they formed a very obvious curve. ”

It was not an exaggeration to describe him as an eyelash essence.

“As Ye Zhuo applied sunscreen on him, he sighed, “Say, you’re a man. Why do your eyelashes grow so long?” ”

“”Your eyelashes aren’t short either,”Cen Shaoqing said. ” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“”That’s different. You’re a man, and I’m a woman.”Ye Zhuo continued, “Tell me, did you secretly apply eyelash growth fluid?” ”

“Although ye Zao’s eyelashes were not short, every time he saw Cen Shaoqing’s eyelashes, ye Zao could not help but exclaim in surprise. ”

“”If I say that it can make you feel better, then it is.”Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddha beads and said, “Do you want me to recommend the brand of eyelash growth liquid to you? “After you use it, you can be like me, so you don’t have to envy me.” ”
