“After cutting off the connection, Manxing stood up and lit a stick of incense in the study. ”

“Perhaps it was because of the constant burning of incense, Manxing always had a pleasant smell on his body. Therefore, Manxing had another nickname in the market, Princess Manxiang. ”

“It was said that when Manxing was born, the room was filled with a strange fragrance, and auspicious things fell from the sky. Princess Manxiang was Manxing Kingdom’s Lucky Star, and she would protect Manxing Kingdom’s prosperity and immortality. ”

“After lighting the incense, Manxing set up the chessboard and began to study the chess game. ”

“Everyone said that Earth’s civilization was too low-class, but she felt that there were many redeeming features on earth. ”

“If Earth was really that low-class, the Alliance of the past alliance countries would not have originated from Earth. ”

This meant that there were still redeeming features on earth.

Over here.

“Not long after Manwen left, he heard about ye Zhuo from his childhood friend Fan Mu. ”

“You said that Miss Ye is my eldest sister?”Man Wen’s face was filled with disbelief.

“Fan Mu nodded, and her voice sounded as if she was watching a good show. “Something happened this time. Your sister was originally the most legendary woman in the entire Manxing nation. If your eldest sister were to return, your sister’s position would be in jeopardy.” ”

“Ever since Manxing was born, it had always carried its own halo, causing people to admire it endlessly. ”

“To suddenly have an elder sister, especially since this elder sister’s environment was not even as good as hers. She had been a vagabond since she was young, but she was better than her in every way. If it was anyone else, they would probably feel a drop in their hearts. ”

“Man Wen frowned and said, “Why did she come back! I only have one elder sister, Manxing! I don’t even acknowledge other elder sisters! What right does she have to come back!” ”

“I didn’t realize that you have such deep feelings for your sister?”Fan Mu looked at man Wen.

Man Wen rolled his eyes at him. “What do you know!”

“Fan Mu continued, “Right, didn’t you idolize Miss Ye the most in the past? Now that Miss Ye is your eldest sister, you should be happy! How can you not let her come back?” ”

“Man Wen said, “Who said I idolized her! This young master has never idolized anyone in my entire life!” ”

“With that, man Wen looked at Fan Mu. “Has the news been confirmed? Ye... is she really my eldest sister?” ”

“Fan Mu said casually, “Even if I say it, he doesn’t count. You have to ask your father for the details.” ”

Man Wen put down the wine that he had stolen from Earth and turned around to walk back.

Man Wen walked all the way to man Jiangshan’s office. “Father!”

“When he saw man Wen, who reeked of alcohol, man Jiangshan felt a headache coming on. “Why are you drinking again!” ”

Alcohol was the most inferior liquid in Manxing country.

Most of them were poor people who could not afford to drink nutrient fluids and secretly went to earth to carry them back. This was originally the work of poor people. Who would have thought that the son of a dignified leader would also do such a thing.

It was embarrassing to say it out loud!

“”Dad, is Miss Ye really a full moon?”Man Wen went straight to the point. ”

“Hearing that, man Jiangshan said with a straight face, “What full moon! You have no manners at all. That’s your elder sister! Can you call her a full moon?” ”

He was simply being rude.

“As a younger brother, why couldn’t he learn from man Xing? ”

“”Who said she’s my elder sister! I don’t have an elder sister! My only elder sister is man Xing! I only acknowledge man Xing as my elder sister! Other than man Xing, I don’t acknowledge anyone else!” ”

“Man Jiangshan was originally very angry, but when he heard that man Wen was so protective of Manxing, most of the anger in his heart dissipated. At the very least, man Wen still had Manxing as his elder sister. ”

“As long as the siblings were harmonious, it would be fine. ”

“Man Jiangshan could see that man Wen did not have much success in his life. In the future, he could only rely on Manxing to live. ”

“”Ye Zhuo is also your elder sister. She will return in a few days. When that time comes, you can’t be so rude!”Man Jiangshan said with a straight face. ”

“Man Wen said, “Anyway, I won’t acknowledge her as my sister!” ” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“You have to acknowledge her even if you don’t! Do you think this is something that you can decide?”Man Jiangshan said angrily.

Man Wen snorted and walked out.

“Little Bastard!”Man Jiangshan grabbed an antique and threw it at man Wen’s back.

“However, man Wen walked quickly and was not hit at all. ”

Thud!

Pieces of antiques fell all over the floor.

Man Jiangshan was furious.

Man Wen came to man Xing’s study and pushed the door open without even knocking. “Sister!”

Man Xing was studying the chess game and was shocked by him. “What’s Wrong?”

“Man Wen looked at man Xing and said, “Sister, don’t worry. I will never let anyone threaten your position. You will always be my only sister!” ”

“”Manwen, what are you saying?”Manxing was still a little confused and didn’t understand what Manwen meant. ”
