Chapter 2494: 526: Don’t tell anyone

Translator: 549690339

Ye Zao was not a fan of posting on wechat moments.

Her wechat moments had not been opened for many days.

There were only a dozen wechat moments.

The first one was a selfie of her and Lin Shasha. The rest were pictures of scenery and daily life. The last one was a show of affection.

On the other side of the South China Sea.

Cen Shaoqing came to an unknown island.

Behind him stood a tall man with blonde hair and blue eyes. He was obviously from C nation.

Cen Shaoqing handed the blueprint to him. “Can you finish it in three days?”

“The Man took the blueprint and studied it from top to bottom. Then he said, “About the same.” ”

“About?”Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly.

“The man immediately changed his words respectfully. “Don’t worry, I will definitely finish it in three days!” ”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing nodded with satisfaction.

“The man continued, “Master Five, there’s one more thing.” ”

“Speak.”

“”It’s not the season for roses to bloom. If we transfer them from other places, we might not have enough time.”The main reason was that Cen Shaoqing wanted too many roses. Even the base would not have so many fresh flowers. ”

“”You don’t have to worry about the flowers. I’ve already made the arrangements,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

“Okay.”The man nodded.

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “Also, don’t tell anyone about this.” ”

“Okay.”

Cen Shaoqing looked up at the blue sky and sea in front of him. “Go do your work.”

“”Fifth master, I’ll be leaving first,”the man said. ”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

Cen Shaoqing just stood there. He recalled the first time he came to this island with Ye Zhuo.

“At that time, he did not know that he had already fallen in love with Ye Zhuo. He mistook his rapid heartbeat for an illness. At that time, Ye Zhuo still took his pulse seriously. ”

“Thinking of this, the corners of Cen Shaoqing’s mouth curled up into a faint smile. ”

...

Ye Zhuo sat at the dining table and ate.

In front of the oval-shaped dining table sat Yu Xianye and Xian ‘er.

“Xian ‘er was the same as Li Yueyue. She was a chatterbox. In addition, Ye Zhuo was her idol. This time, she spoke even more. ”

“”Goddess, I see that you eat quite a lot too. How do you maintain your figure?” ”

“As a woman, Xian ‘er was really envious of ye Zhuo’s figure. ”

“Where he should be thin, he should be thin. where he should be gaining weight, he should be gaining a couple of pounds. ”

“”Exercise more,”ye Zhuo answered. ”

“”Then, do you have anything to avoid?”Xian ‘er continued to ask. ”

“Ye Zhuo shook his head slightly. “In my eyes, there are only two types of food.” ”

“Which two?”Xian ‘er asked.

“Ye Zhuo said, “The ones I like and the ones I don’t like.” ”

“Xian ‘er smiled and said, “Me Too! But I’m not as cool as you. Even if I like them, I don’t dare to eat too much!” ”

“Xian ‘er was a part-time model and usually paid attention to body management. Every morning, the first thing she did when she woke up was to stand on the electronic scale. ”

“”Actually, you won’t gain weight from eating. What’s important is that you exercise after eating.”Ye Zao continued, “Do you usually exercise?” ”

“”Occasionally,”Xian ‘er answered. ”

“At this time, Yu Xiannian said, “Then you still have the nerve to say it!” ”

“Xian ‘er said, “I’m usually so busy. It’s impossible for me to exercise every day.” ”

“Sometimes, it was already two or three in the morning after taking the photos. After sleeping, it would be eleven or twelve in the morning the next day. There was no time to exercise. ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “If you can’t keep exercising, you should pay attention to your diet and eat as little carbs as possible.” ” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“No one was born fat, let alone born thin. ”

A good figure was always maintained.

“Okay.”Xian ‘er nodded.

“Yu Mumu looked at ye Zao and asked, “Sister-in-law, do you know what Zixu went to do?” ”

“I don’t know.”Ye Zao shook his head slightly.

“Yu Mumu narrowed his eyes. “I asked him, but he didn’t say anything. He’s So Mysterious.” ”

“After he said that, Yu Luonian continued to ask, “Sister-in-law, he didn’t tell you either?” ”

“No.”

Xian ‘er glanced at ye Zao and felt that Ye Zao’s heart was a little big.

“”Goddess, aren’t you afraid of master five...”the rest of his words were already self-evident. ”

Xian ‘er had been in this circle for quite some time and had seen all kinds of people. Who knew how many people would miss an outstanding man like Cen Shaoqing.

“What are you afraid of?”Ye Zhuo was stunned.

“Xian ‘er said, “What if master five is secretly eating outside?” ”

“What nonsense are you talking about!”Yu sunset picked up his chopsticks and hit Xian ‘er on the head.

“Xian ‘er said with some grievance, “What I said is the truth. There is no man in this world who doesn’t cheat!” ”

Just like Yu sunset.
