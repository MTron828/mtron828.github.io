Translator: 549690339

First Impressions first.

“As it was Wang Dajun who found Liu Meilian first, and it was also Wang Dajun who gave Liu Meilian advice, Weiwei forgave them. ”

“Therefore, Liu Meilian trusted doctor Wang very much. If it wasn’t for doctor Wang, how would she know that the current Weiwei was actually so promising! ”

Ye Zhuo raised his eyes slightly and looked at Liu Meilian.

“Weiwei immediately introduced, “Sister Ye, this is my mother.”After saying that, Weiwei continued, “Mother, don’t talk about sister ye like that. Sister Ye is also kind-hearted!” ”

“”What kind-hearted? She just doesn’t have good intentions!”Liu Meilian snorted coldly, then, she continued, “Some people rely on their own achievements and don’t even recognize themselves! Our Weiwei is young and doesn’t distinguish between good and Evil! We don’t welcome you here. Please leave immediately!” ”

“These people were jealous of Vivi’s youth and talent. The money she earned before she became an adult was higher than that of an adult, so they couldn’t wait to harm Vivi! ”

She was simply too shameless!

“”Mom! Don’t you dare talk about sister Ye Like That!”Vivi liked ye Zao very much. If ye Zao didn’t conceal her illness, she would definitely believe ye Zao. ”

“Liu Meilian looked at Vivi with a helpless expression. “My silly child, what exactly is her purpose now? Can’t you see it?” ”

“Ye Zhuo couldn’t be bothered with Liu Meilian. He just looked at Wei Wei and opened his red lips. “Wei Wei, I’ve said what I need to say. The decision is in your hands.” ”

“Saying this, Ye Zhuo turned around and left. ”

“Wei Wei looked at Ye Zhuo’s back and opened her mouth, but in the end, she didn’t say anything. ”

Liu Meilian immediately followed behind ye Zhuo to close the door.

“After closing the door, she continued, “Wei Wei, I’m telling you, don’t be fooled by that Ye Guy. She’s definitely not a good person!” ”

“Weiwei said, “Mom, don’t talk about sister ye like that. I believe in her. She’s doing this for my own good.” ”

“Liu Meilian rebuked, “Look at you, you’re blaming Mom! MOM is doing this all for you! Do you know, when mom heard that doctor Wang said that your current condition was very serious, she was scared silly! Fortunately, God blessed her and allowed doctor Wang to find a cure. From now on, our family will live happily together and don’t have to worry about anything.”Then, Vivi gave her the salary for safekeeping. ”

“Six figures a month, a minimum of 100,000 yuan, and then the whole family wouldn’t have to go to work! ”

“The more Liu Meilian thought about it, the more excited she became. ”

Vivi also yearned for that kind of life.

She had never had a happy family. Everything now was just like a dream.

Creak —

“At this moment, the door of the ward was pushed open. ”

“”Vivi, Look What Daddy bought for You!”Xiang Chao walked in from outside. ”

Vivi turned her head and saw Xiang Chao holding a toy doll in his hand.

No one had ever bought something like this for her.

No girl could resist a furry toy doll. Vivian’s eyes lit up as well.

“Xiang Chao brought the furry toy doll to Vivian. “Do you like it, Vivian?” ”

“”I do.”Vivian took the toy doll with a surprised look on her face. “Thank you, Dad.” ” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“She was touched, but also a little afraid. She was afraid that this was just a dream, and she was even more afraid of repeating what happened when she was young. ”

She did not want to be abandoned a second time.

“What are you thanking me for?”Xiang Chao patted Weiwei’s head lovingly. “This is what dad should do.”

“At this point, Xiang Chao sighed. “Weiwei, it’s all Dad’s fault in the past. Dad has let you down, and even more so, your grandmother...” ”

“Seeing Xiang Chao play the bitter card with Weiwei, Liu Meilian was not willing to be outdone. She immediately cried, “And mom, Mom has also let you down, Weiwei...” ”

“When Xiang Chao and Liu Meilian first came to look for her, Weiwei was really angry. ”

“She was angry that these two people ignored her when she was young, and now they came to look for her again. Their faces were really ugly! ”

“Later, when she saw that Liu Meilian and Xiang Chao had their own difficulties, she gradually let down her guard. ”

“In the end, Weiwei was only a thirteen or fourteen-year-old child. ”

Children at this age were the most sensitive and easily touched.

“”It’s okay,”Weiwei said in a hoarse voice, “Dad, Mom, the past is the past. We will always be together in the future.” ”

“Hearing this, Liu Meilian’s eyes were full of pride. ”

Xiang Chao was the same.
