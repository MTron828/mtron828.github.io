Inviolable.

“Ye zhuo sighed and said, “What a pity! I was planning to catch two of them and bring them back.” ” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Just feel the scene of hitting a robe and ladling fish.”Cen Shaoqing held ye Zhuo’s hand. “The important thing is to participate.”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Since they had come to the grassland, they had to respect the local customs. They could not break the traditional rules just because of her alone. ”

Li Shuyi came to the Li family again.

“”Little uncle, little aunt.” ”

“Fang yinyue smiled and said, “Shuyi, you must have something to tell us, right?” ”

“Li Shuyi nodded. “Not only something, but also a happy occasion.” ”

“What happy occasion?”Li Sanzhu asked curiously.

“Li Shuyi smiled and said, “It’s about sister Yueyue’s happy occasion.” ”

“Speaking of this, Fang yinyue roughly knew why Li Shuyi came. ”

“Li Yueyue was only in her third year, so Fang yinyue didn’t want Li Yueyue to leave her so early. He continued, “Shuyi, are you trying to introduce Yueyue to someone?” ”

Li Shuyi was stunned. She didn’t expect Fang yinyue to see through her thoughts. She smiled and nodded. “Yes.”

“Fang yinyue looked at Li Shuyi and continued, “It’s a good thing to introduce Yueyue to someone. However, Yueyue is still young. Most importantly, she hasn’t graduated yet. Your uncle and I want her to stay with us for two more years.” ”

Parents didn’t want their children to leave them too early.

“This was especially true for girls. Once they got married, they would return home to their parents, and the number of times they would return home would gradually decrease. ”

Li Shuyi felt that Fang yinyue was a little hypocritical.

“She clearly wanted to introduce someone with a good family background to Li Yueyue, but she wanted to make it seem like she couldn’t bear to part with Li Yueyue. ”

Just wait and see.

“After she revealed John’s family background, Fang yinyue would definitely nod and agree impatiently. ”

“After all, John was from the Jones family. ”

The Jones family was an unattainable noble family. What right did a mere li family have to compete with the Jones Family?

To be able to marry into the Jones family was a blessing that the Li family had cultivated for countless lifetimes.

“Li Shuyi maintained her smile and continued, “Little aunt, I know what you mean. You haven’t listened to me.” ”

“”Speak,”Fang yinyue said. ”

“Li Shuyi continued, “The man is my cousin. “You should know about my mother’s background. My mother was born in the Jones family and is one of the top noble surnames in C Nation. “Once the matter between yueyue and my cousin John is settled, she will be my cousin-in-law and the future mistress of our family.” ”

“At this point, Li Shuyi paused, then, she said, “Little aunt, don’t worry. My cousin is very handsome. I guarantee that he will not mistreat yueyue. If Yueyue is not my cousin, I really can’t bear to introduce her to my cousin.” ”

“There was no change in Fang yinyue’s expression. She continued, “Shuyi, I know what you mean, but you may not understand what I mean.” ”

“Although Li Shuyi had taken the name of a Chinese, she did not have a deep understanding of Chinese culture. Fang yinyue’s words stunned her. She thought that Fang yinyue would be grateful for her words. ”

“She did not expect Fang yinyue to not be grateful. Instead, he put on a fake smile. ”

“”Young aunt, I don’t understand what you mean,”Li Shuyi stood up and said. ”

“Fang yinyue said, “Shuyi, I’ve already made it very clear just now. I don’t want to let Yueyue get married so early.” ”

Don’t want to let Yueyue get married so early?

Li Shuyi waited for a moment and looked at Fang yinyue in disbelief. Fang yinyue didn’t know what she was talking about!

“”Young aunt, my cousin is the legitimate heir of the Jones family. He’s not some random person.”Li Shuyi continued, “As Yueyue’s cousin, I definitely won’t harm Yueyue. It’s said that the good water shouldn’t flow to outsiders. Otherwise, I definitely won’t introduce Yueyue to my cousin.” ”

She thought that Fang yinyue definitely didn’t fully understand the meaning of her words.

That was the Jones family!

A statement and status that many Chinese people dreamed of.

“Now, this big pie fell on Li Yueyue’s body, but Fang yinyue was unmoved. ”

This was somewhat unexpected.

“No matter what, Fang yinyue shouldn’t have this expression. ”

“Fang yinyue smiled at Li Shuyi, then, she said, “Shuyi, I know you’re doing this for Yueyue’s good. But your uncle and I really don’t want Yueyue to get married so early. Moreover, we don’t want her to get married too far away. Let alone overseas, even if she crosses provinces, your uncle and I can’t stand it.” ”
