Translator: 549690339

Zhao Xueyin did not say anything.

“Father Zhao continued, “Your brother is a soft-hearted person. If you want him to accept you, you have to treat him better! Only then can he get ye Zhu to treat your face. “I’ve already asked around. The brother and sister of the Ye family listen to your brother the most.” Zhao Xueyin had to get ye Sen’s approval. ”

“Got it.”

On the other side.

At the hospital.

“After eating a sweet potato, Ye Sen looked up at Ye Zao and asked nervously, “Zao Zao, you... You’re not angry, right?” ”

“Ye Zao took a sip of milk tea and asked in return, “Why are you angry?” ”

“”About... about Zhao zhenfei,”Ye Sen continued to explain, “Actually, actually, I don’t want to forgive him, but he insisted on committing suicide in front of me. I saw that he was already old, so, so...” ”

“He just couldn’t bear it?”Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly.

“Yes.”Ye Sen nodded.

“Ye Zao continued, “Uncle, I respect your choice. However, you have to be mentally prepared. What will happen next may exceed your expectations.” ”

“”Zao Zao, do you know something?”Ye Sen asked. ”

“Ye Zao said, “I’m just casually saying it. Just listen to it.” ”

Ye Sen knew ye Zao very well. He knew that ye Zao was never a person who liked to say things casually.

She must have her own reasons for saying that.

“However, ye Zao did not want to say more, so he did not ask further. ”

“In the blink of an eye, the next day arrived. ”

“At seven o’clock in the morning, Father Zhao brought Zhao Xueyin to the hospital. ”

“”Sen, this is your only sister. Her name is Xueyin. Snow that snows, chanting. Because she was born on a snowy day, father gave her this name. Xueyin, this is your only brother in this world!” ”

“”Brother!”Zhao Xueyin threw herself in front of ye Sen’s hospital bed. Tears instantly flowed down her face. “Brother, I’ve finally met you! Brother! After so many years, we’re finally reunited, Brother!” ”

Zhao Xueyin cried her heart out.

She was heartbroken.

“If it wasn’t for the fact that she still had some use for ye Sen, Zhao Xueyin wouldn’t be like this. ”

She wanted to be her brother?

Just because he was an illegitimate child?

Shameless!

Ye Sen was shocked by Zhao Xueyin.

Was there another good spot on her face?

It was shocking.

It made people shudder.

“Father Zhao stood at the side and wiped his tears. “Sen, your sister’s life is tough. She’s so young, but her face is already disfigured! It’s a pity that she hasn’t found a boyfriend yet...” ”

“”No, didn’t you go to the hospital to have a look?”Ye Sen asked. ”

“Father Zhao continued, “We did, but the Doctor said that your sister’s face can’t be cured. She’ll probably be like this for the rest of her life! She’s still so young, so pitiful! Your sister is so pitiful!” ”

“Ye Sen said, “Now that medicine is so advanced, you should go to a few more hospitals to have a look.” ”

“”It’s useless.”Father Zhao waved his hand. “We went to a lot of hospitals, but the doctors said that your sister’s face is hopeless, unless, unless...” ”

“Unless what?”Ye Sen asked immediately.

Father Zhao sighed. “Unless Hua Tuo is alive!”

“At this point, Father Zhao seemed to have thought of something. “Oh right, Sen, doesn’t your eldest niece have good medical skills? Why Don’t you let her take a look at your sister? Her medical skills are so good that she will definitely be able to cure your sister’s face!” ”

Let Ye Zhuo Cure Zhao Xueyin’s face?

Ye Sen could not say this out loud.

“”This... this... this is probably not good, right?”Ye Sen said. ”

“Father Zhao continued, “What’s not good about this? She is your biological sister. Could it be that you have the heart to see your sister like this for the rest of her life? “Moreover, as a doctor, it is my duty to practice medicine and save people. I believe that your niece will definitely not leave her in the Lurch!” ”

“Zhao Xueyin grabbed father Zhao’s arm. “Dad, you just met your brother. Please don’t make things difficult for him! I’m fine. I’m used to it these days anyway.” ”

“Father Zhao covered his face and began to cry. “Xueyin, it’s all my fault. If it weren’t for my two slaps, you wouldn’t have become like this. I’m sorry, I’m sorry...” ”

“”It’s okay, Dad. You Don’t have to blame yourself. I’m really fine.”Zhao Xueyin looked up at father Zhao and ye Sen. “As long as you and brother Bury the hatchet and father and son recognize each other, that’s good!” ”

“Xueyin...”

“Seeing the father and daughter like this, Ye Sen couldn’t bear it. ”

“”You, you guys don’t cry. I, I, I will help you talk to Zhonghua.” ”

“Really?”Father Zhao turned to look at Ye Sen.

Ye Sen nodded. “Yes.”

“”Sen, thank you, thank you!”Father Zhao looked at Zhao Xueyin again. “Xueyin, hurry up and thank your brother!” ”

He knew that Ye Sen would definitely agree to it.

“After all, blood was thicker than water. ”

Getting Ye Zhuo to treat Zhao Xueyin’s face was only the first step.

“After Zhao Xueyin recovered, he would make ye Zhuo acknowledge him as his grandfather and Zhao Xueyin as his aunt in front of the entire financial world! ”

Father Zhao felt extremely happy when he thought of this scene. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Zhao Xueyin’s lips curled up, and she felt extremely happy in her heart. ”

“After suppressing herself for so many days, she finally saw Hope. ”

This time.

She would definitely step on this little B * Tch ye Zhuo under her feet.

Definitely!

“Thinking of this, Zhao Xueyin’s lowered eyes were filled with a sinister light. ”

Creak —

The door was pushed open from the outside.

It was ye Zao who came in with breakfast.

“”Zao Zao!”Seeing ye Zao, Father Zhao immediately smiled kindly. ”

“Now That Ye Sen had acknowledged him, as his grandfather, it was not an exaggeration for him to call ye Zao ‘Zao Zao’. ”

“Ye Zao’s expression was indifferent. “Old Mister Zhao, I’m afraid we’re not that close, right?” ”

“Father Zhao still maintained his kind smile. “Zao Zao, I know you won’t be able to accept me for a while, but I’m still your uncle’s father.” ”

“Face is a good thing.”Ye Zhonghua looked at Father Zhao. “Unfortunately... you don’t have it.”

“Father Zhao was not angry. He continued, “Zhonghua, everything in the past was a misunderstanding. From now on, we will be a family behind closed doors! I believe that one day, our family will bury the Hatchet!” ”

Ye Zhonghua did not acknowledge him now?

It did not matter!

“As long as Ye Sen acknowledged him, ye Zhonghua would have to call him grandpa. ”

“Just as Father Zhao was secretly pleased with himself, there was a knock on the door. ”

Zhao Xueyin walked over to open the door.

“The moment the door opened, a few policemen walked in from outside. ”

“Seeing the policemen, Father Zhao was a little nervous. ”

“Captain Li walked over to Father Zhao’s side. “Zhao Zhenfei, is it?” ”

“Father Zhao nodded. Before he could react, a cold handcuff was handcuffed to his hand. “We found out that you are related to this murder case. Please come with US immediately.” ”
