Chapter 77: 072: Face slapping! In the burning business empire, Lin Sha recognized the scumbag and had an abortion 6

“Okay!”Zhang Qiang nodded.

With mother Zhang’s words, Zhang Qiang felt much more at ease.

Mother Zhang picked up her bag, then she said, “Okay, I won’t tell you anymore. I heard that there are two big shops on the road of Ba Cheng that are going to be renovated recently. They have a total of six to seven hundred square meters. They can earn at least 100,000,000 yuan. Many renovation companies are eyeing this fat piece of meat! “I have to go there personally. I Can’t let other renovation companies snatch this fat piece of meat!”

When mother Zhang brought the renovation plan to Ba Cheng Road, the Ye family’s private restaurant was still in line.

Mother Zhang was stunned.

So there was such a good restaurant on Ba Cheng Road!

With so many people lining up, how much money would they earn in one day!

No wonder they had to expand the shop!

For a moment, mother Zhang was filled with envy.

At this moment, mother Zhang suddenly remembered that ye Shu had said that her restaurant was located on Ba Cheng Road. ..

As for the exact number, mother Zhang didn’t take it to heart at that time.

Could it be that the owner of the Ye’s private restaurant was ye Shu?

Mother Zhang widened her eyes in shock.

That shouldn’t be the case, right?

That day, she saw that ye Shu’s clothes were very ordinary. There wasn’t even a single piece of gold jewelry on her body. If the Ye’s private restaurant was really ye Shu, would ye Shu dress so shabbily?

Therefore, the Ye family’s private dishes definitely weren’t ye Shu’s.

Thinking of this, mother Zhang felt a lot more at ease.

It wasn’t easy for her to wait until lunch break. Finally, there were no customers lining up in the shop. Mother Zhang immediately walked into the shop.

The interior decoration was very ordinary.

If she hadn’t seen it with her own eyes, it would be hard to believe that such an ordinary shop had to line up every day.

Mother Zhang looked around and then said to the waiter beside her, “Hello, I’m the Lady Boss of Zhang Wang’s renovation company. I’m looking for the owner of your shop.” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

At this moment, she suddenly saw a familiar figure.

That Was... Ye Shu?

That’s right, it was ye Shu!

Mother Zhang was completely stunned.

The Ye’s private kitchen was really ye Shu’s?

Or was ye Shu just working part-time?

She was probably just working part-time, right?

Mother Zhang tugged at the waiter’s sleeve and said in a low voice, “Young Lady, who is that woman?”

The waiter looked at Mother Zhang. “She’s Our Lady Boss.”

Mother Zhang’s face turned pale.

So it really was!

Ye Shu was really the owner of this shop.

Oh My God!

Mother Zhang swallowed her saliva and asked, “The two shops next door need to be renovated, right? How much is the rent here for a month?”

The waiter said, “These shops were bought by Our Lady Boss herself. I don’t know how much the rent is. Then, Our Lady Boss has already negotiated with the other renovation companies. If you are here to talk about the renovation, I advise you not to waste any more time.”

Bought? bought?

Mother Zhang felt like she was in a bad mood.

According to the real estate prices in Yunjing, these three shops were worth at least ten million!

Oh My God!

Mother Zhang’s face turned paler and paler. She really didn’t expect ye Shu to be so rich.

After a long time, mother Zhang finally reacted. She straightened her back and walked towards ye Shu.

After all, she would be Lin Shasha’s mother-in-law.

With the relationship between the two families.

Even if these two shops had already negotiated with other companies, Ye Shu would definitely give it to her to renovate!

Moreover, Ye Shu was able to do so well in the restaurant because she must have some special secret recipe. She could also ask ye Shu for the secret recipe!

At that time, she could also open a restaurant across from ye Shu!

The more Zhang thought about it, the more beautiful she became. She walked to Ye Shu’s side, “Sister ye Shu! Just now, I thought I was seeing things! So it really is you! We are family, so you can rest assured that I will renovate these two restaurants! Don’t worry, I will definitely give you a discount! Who asked us to be relatives!”

Ye Shu already knew what the Zhang family had done, but at this moment, there was no smile on her face.

This family was really shameless.

They were already like this, yet they still had the nerve to come knocking on their door.

“Big Sister, I’m not familiar with you.”Ye Shu smiled faintly. “Also, my shop has already been handed over to boss Yang from Hengshuo Renovation Company.”

Mother Zhang continued, “Sister Ye Shu, look at what you’re saying. How can we not be familiar with each other! I’m Sasha’s future mother-in-law!”

Ye Shu frowned. “Didn’t Sasha tell you that she broke up with Zhang Qiang?”

“No! Impossible!”Mother Zhang smiled. “How could Sasha break up with Xiaoqiang? !”

How Could Lin Shasha Bear to give up on Zhang Qiang?
