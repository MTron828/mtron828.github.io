Translator: 549690339

“Only then did Zhang Qingqing realize that the official Weibo post of the LIN Group had been posted. After opening the video, Zhang Qingqing could hardly believe her eyes.”

It wasn’t real.

This wasn’t real!

Why would there be a camera in the room of the clubhouse?

Who Put the camera there?

PA —

Zhang Qingqing smashed her phone!

The phone fell to the ground and the screen shattered.

“At this moment, father Zhang rushed in from the outside and looked at Zhang Qingqing. He was so angry that his facial features were twisted. “I’ll ask you one last time. Whose is the bastard in your stomach?””

He never dreamed that Zhang Qingqing was the one who had orchestrated all of this.

“He originally thought that although Zhang Qingqing had been kept as a mistress, at least her stomach was real.”

Zhang Qingqing sat on the ground and cried.

“I’m asking you a question!”

“”Her father, her father, calm down. What if there’s a misunderstanding?”Mother Zhang walked over from behind.”

“”It’s all because you spoiled her!”Father Zhang directly shook off mother Zhang’s hand. “A loving mother is a wastrel. If it wasn’t for you, how would she have become like this today?””

Mother Zhang pursed her lips and didn’t say anything.

“I’m asking you a question!”Father Zhang couldn’t take it anymore and grabbed Zhang Qingqing’s hair.

“Zhang Qingqing cried until her eyes were swollen, but she still insisted, “It’s Lin Ze’s! The child is Lin Ze’s! It’s Lin Ze’s!””

The child in her stomach was the heir of the Lin Family!

Lin Ze had already promised to marry her.

An illusion.

All of this was an illusion.

It wasn’t real!

“B * Stard!”Father Zhang slapped Zhang Qingqing. “What time is it now! You’re Still Dreaming!”

Father Zhang was both angry and angry.

This daughter had completely disgraced him!

How could he treat his relatives and friends with dignity in the future?

“Zhang Qingqing was stunned by the slap, but she was still muttering, “It’s Lin Ze’s! It’s Lin Ze’s!””

“She was the future young mistress of the Lin family, and the child in her belly was the only descendant of the Lin family. In the future, she would inherit the Lin family’s assets.”

Father Zhang was so angry that his entire body was trembling. “What a disgrace!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“At this moment, Zhang Lei ran in from outside in a panic. “Dad! Dad!””

“What’s Wrong?”Father Zhang looked at Zhang Lei.

“Zhang lei continued, “Outside! There’s a bunch of reporters outside! They said they want to interview us! And some people brought rotten eggs over! What should we do!””

Zhang Lei was extremely glad that he did not appear with his parents when they appeared on camera.

“If he had appeared with them, he would have become the one that everyone despised.”

“Just a short while after his parents appeared on camera, many of his classmates had called him to check if Zhang Qingqing was his sister!”

It was fine for those who did not know his parents or Zhang Qingqing. Those who were familiar with their family environment did not know how to laugh at them behind their backs.

“Zhang Lei was glad that he had a sister like Zhang Qingqing a day ago, but now he hated her.”

It was too embarrassing!

“With the development of the Internet, everyone in the country knew about Zhang Qingqing’s scandal. Even his parents were implicated!”

“If Zhang Qingqing didn’t call him suddenly, he would have married his girlfriend by now.”

What about now?

“Not only was he not married, it would be difficult for him to find a girlfriend of the same social status in the future.”

It was all Zhang Qingqing’s fault!

“As a young man of the times, Zhang Lei knew how influential online public opinion was.”

The Internet could make or break a person!

The current Zhang family had been destroyed by Zhang Qingqing!

“Zhang Lei looked at his parents and said, “Dad, Mom, let’s leave quickly!””

They had to leave the capital before the heat was fully released.

“As he said that, Zhang Lei pulled his parents up.”

“Mother Zhang said, “If we leave, what about your sister?””

“As a mother, mother Zhang still felt sorry for Zhang Qingqing.”

“Zhang lei frowned and said, “It’s already so late, and you still have the mood to care about her? Let me tell you, the best way now is to sever ties with her!””

“Father Zhang said, “Lei lei is right, sever ties! Just treat it as I’ve never had such an embarrassing daughter!””

Mother Zhang could not bear it.

“No matter what, Zhang Qingqing was born in her womb for ten months.”

“No matter what Zhang Qingqing did wrong, she was still her daughter.”

“”If you want to leave, you can leave! I’m not leaving!”Mother Zhang hugged Zhang Qingqing and cried, “If I leave at this time, then my Qingqing will not be able to live!””

Zhang Qingqing was now in the most need of company.
