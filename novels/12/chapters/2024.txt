“Ye Zhuo looked at this scene, and her eyes were a little sore. Her left hand was clenched into a fist, and her clear face was hidden in the darkness of the night. No one could see her expression clearly. ”

“In her memory, Ye Han was a wanton and unrestrained person. ”

When had he ever been humiliated like this?

“A scholar could be killed, but not humiliated! ”

“”This autumn flute is simply too detestable!”Yi Ling said angrily. “One day, I will let her taste the taste of being humiliated by others!” ”

“”There will be such a day.”Ye Zhuo’s tone was very faint, almost unable to detect the hidden emotions in his voice. ”

“After saying this, ye Zhuo continued: “Go and attract ye Han over there.” ”

“”Alright.”Yi Ling nodded, flying out in the night. ”

“Although ye Han was kneeling in the rain, there were Gu worms in his body, but his sensitivity was still there, not the slightest bit inferior to before. ”

“Almost as soon as Yi Ling flew over, he noticed it. ”

“Ye Han narrowed his eyes, his slender fingers touching the emei spike at his waist. ”

Xiu —

An Emei Spike flew over.

Under the moonlight.

“The emei spike shone with a cold and gloomy light, making it hard for people to open their eyes. ”

“Yi Han nimbly dodged, dodging the emei spike that flew over. ”

So close!

She was almost hit by the Emei Spike.

Yi Ling let out a long breath.

“Just as Yi Ling let out a sigh of relief, ye Han caught sight of Yi Ling’s figure in the darkness. He immediately stood up from the rain and chased after her. ”

“Yi Ling! Stop!”

Yi Ling quickly flew in ye Zao’s direction.

“Soon, Ye Han’s figure disappeared outside the courtyard. ”

“In the office, Qiu Changzhen also saw this scene and stood up. “Di’er, look over there!” ”

“Qiu Di looked out of the window. “What’s wrong, Father?” ”

Qiu Changzhen frowned. “Ye Han is gone!”

He was clearly still there just now.

It was almost in an instant.

“From this, it could be seen how terrifying ye Han’s ability was! ”

“Don’t worry about him.”Qiu Di narrowed his eyes.

“Should we send someone out to look for him?”Qiu Chang Zhen asked.

Qiu Di shook his head.

Ye Han was just a marionette. could he turn the sky upside down?

What was there to look for?

“Qiu Chang Zhen was a little worried. “Di’er, I heard that the strong acid rain is very stimulating. Do you think ye Han will be stimulated by the strong acid rain and think of something?” ”

“If ye Han had any problems at this critical moment, then it would really be a futile effort. ”

“Anyone could have problems, but not ye Han! ”

“Autumn town chuckled. “Father, don’t worry too much.” ”

Autumn town frowned.

“Do you know why ye Han has become like this?”Autumn town looked at autumn town and asked.

“Autumn town continued, “Great Witch Doctor.” ”

“If not for the Great Witch Doctor Changing Ye Han’s memories, Ye Han would not have become like this. ”

“”Great Witch Doctor? Do you think the Great Witch Doctor really has the ability to change memories?”Autumn flute continued, “To be precise, it is a gu worm raised by the Great Witch Doctor.” ”

“Although the Great Witch Doctor was powerful, he was not that powerful. ”

“Otherwise, he would not have been defeated by ye Zao back then. ”

“At this point, autumn flute looked out of the window, “The current ye Han is a puppet that has been controlled. The Gu worms have already invaded his limbs and bones. Not to mention being drenched in strong acid rain, even if he was pressed into a strong acid rain swimming pool and soaked for a few days, he would not be able to become the ye Han of the past.” ”

Gu Worm?

Qiu Chang Zhen was stunned. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

He knew a bit about the legend of Gu Worms.

Gu worms originated from a very evil sorcery on earth.

“The Great Witch Doctor had always walked an evil path, so it was not uncommon for him to have a relationship with Gu Worms. ”

“”According to what you said, Ye Han should still be kneeling there. Why did he suddenly disappear?”Qiu Chang Zhen asked. ”

There must be something fishy going on.

Autumn town was worried that ye Han would betray autumn flute.

“Autumn flute took a sip of tea. “If I’m not wrong, Ye Han should have been attracted away by some strange movement. To be precise, an outsider should have been here just now.” ”

“After all, protecting her was ye Han’s only mission at the moment. ”

“Seeing someone barge into the courtyard, ye Han naturally would not sit still and wait for death. ”

“Even if he had to sacrifice that dog life of his, he would still protect himself! ”

“Thinking of this, the corners of autumn flute’s lips curled up. ”

“Ye Zhuo probably wouldn’t even dream that one day, Ye Han would sacrifice his life in order to protect her. ”

“”The person who just arrived must be Li Zi Yue!”Qiu Chang Zhen narrowed his eyes and continued, “The day of the general election is about to arrive. Li Zi Yue and the others want to awaken ye Han’s memories! Then they will join forces with Ye Han to deal with you!” ”
