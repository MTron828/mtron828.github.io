Translator: 549690339

“As the main assessment officer, ye Zao clearly had the ability to stop all of this, but ye Zao did not stop it after all. Instead, he allowed it to develop! ”

Who Was Zheng Wanyin?

Cen Shaoqing’s cousin!

Did she really put Zheng Wanyin in her eyes?

“Ye Zao did this not only because he did not put Zheng Wanyin in his eyes, but also because he did not put the CEN family and Cen Shaoqing in his eyes. ”

“Ye Zao had not even passed through the door yet, but he had already pinned the CEN family members to the ground and bullied them. If he passed through the door, wouldn’t he be sent to heaven! ”

The Cen family was about to face a great disaster!

Bai Tang was actually able to smile!

He was simply brainless.

Just wait and see.

“Once ye Zao passed through the door, Bai Tang would have a good ending. ”

“Based on Ye Zao’s current situation, could she treat the elderly well and show filial piety to the elderly? ”

How could that be possible!

“Fortunately, the Cen family still had someone like her who understood. ”

Otherwise...

The Cen family would be finished.

A beauty was a disaster.

“At that time, the Cen family’s wealth would all be lost at the hands of Ye Zao. ”

No.

“As long as her grandmother was around, she would definitely not let ye Zao, this disaster, enter the family. ”

Xie wanqiu narrowed her eyes and walked to Zheng Wanyin’s side. “Yinyin.”

“Grandma!”Zheng Wanyin hugged Xie wanqiu and cried hysterically.

She didn’t want to live anymore.

“At this moment, Zheng Wanyin really didn’t want to live anymore. ”

All her face in her life had been lost today.

“However, Zheng Wanyin was still the type of person who cared deeply about her face. ”

She didn’t know why things had turned out this way.

She thought that she could at least get an A today and be promoted to the management level.

She did not expect...

She did not expect such a result in the end.

She was famous by the ABA Core Team.

What was she going to do?

Her future was ruined.

It was all ruined by Ye Zao.

“”Good girl, don’t Cry!”Seeing Zheng Wanyin cry like this, Xie Wanqiu’s heart ached. She continued, “Don’t cry. If no one is left here, there will be others! Come, Let’s go home! Let them regret it!” ”

“The year Zheng Wanyin was born, Xie Wanqiu looked for a fortune teller to read her fortune. ”

Zheng Wanyin was born with the life of a Phoenix.

What was the life of a Phoenix?

“In ancient times, the life of a Phoenix was meant to be the empress, the mother of the world. ”

It was also because the times had changed.

“If one were to go back a few thousand years, then Zheng Wanyin would be the empress. ”

Zheng Wanyin joining the ABA was a blessing for the ABA.

“Now that the blind CEO had removed Zheng Wanyin from the ABA, it was the ABA’s loss. ”

They dared to cause trouble for Phoenix.

Just wait and see.

Something would happen to ABA sooner or later!

There would be times when they would regret it.

“Xie wanqiu held onto Zheng Wanyin’s arm. “Good child, let’s Go! In the future, if they cry and beg you to come back, you just have to be softer than them!” ”

“Speaking up to this point, Xie wanqiu sighed. “You Child, you’re just too soft-hearted! I’ve Long said that being soft-hearted is a weakness.” ”

Wasn’t Ye Zhuo taking advantage of Zheng Wanyin’s soft-heartedness to bully her?

This was because ye Zhuo knew that Zheng Wanyin wouldn’t hold it against her. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Zheng Wanyin kept her head down the entire way. No one knew what she was feeling at this moment.

No one could understand either.

“Mom.”Zhou Xiang walked over from the side.

Xie Wanqiu didn’t say anything.

This Zhou Xiang actually had the nerve to call her that!

“Zhou Xiang continued, “Mom, don’t worry. Yaozao isn’t that kind of stingy person. For this matter, as long as Wanyin and Yaozao properly apologize, Yaozao will definitely forgive her.” ”

“When she heard this, Xie wanqiu immediately blew her top. ”

“Apologize! ? Who are you asking to apologize?”

Ask Zheng Wanyin to apologize to Yaozao?

On what basis?

Could Yaozao take it?

“Zhou xiang continued, “Ask Wanyin to apologize to ye Zao!”This matter was Zheng Wanyin’s fault to begin with. ”

She was the one who wronged ye Zao for no reason and even accused ye Zao of swapping her and Bai Xiaosu’s test papers.

“Fortunately, there were surveillance cameras. ”

“Otherwise, ye Zao would not be able to clear his name even if he jumped into the Yellow River. ”

Zhou Xiang had no choice.

It was not easy to be a stepdaughter.

“If Zheng Wanyin was her biological niece, she would definitely not let this matter go like this. ”

“There was already a layer of distance between her and Zheng Wanyin. If she continued to use this matter as an excuse, Xie wanqiu would definitely make an issue out of it. ”

Zhou Xiang hated these things the most.

“These few days when Xie wanqiu came to the Cen family, she felt that she had aged more than ten years. ”

Xie wanqiu just looked at Zhou Xiang and could not say a word for a long time.

Hehe!

This was the good daughter that she raised!

Outsiders said that Zhou Xiang treated her better than her biological mother.

But which biological daughter would help outsiders bully her old mother.

“She was already over 70 years old this year, yet she was still scolded by Zhou Xiang. ”

“If she was Zhou Xiang’s biological mother, would Zhou Xiang still treat her like this? ”
