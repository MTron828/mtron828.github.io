Song Shiyu smiled but didn’t say anything.

“Old Master Chen continued, “You and Yaoyao are really worrying me.” ”

“After saying that, old master Chen sighed softly. “Time really flies! I remember when I first met you, you were still a child! How Old Were You Then? Seven, right?” ”

“”Nine,”old master Chen said. ”

“Nine?”Old Master Chen asked in surprise.

“In fact, Old Master Chen clearly remembered that song Shiyu was nine when he first met him. ”

He asked this on purpose to find out if song Shiyu still remembered what happened that year.

“As he expected, song Shiyu was a very grateful person. ”

“Although many years had passed, he still remembered what had happened. ”

“Song Shiyu nodded. “Yes, he was nine years old.” ”

“When the nine-year-old song Shiyu first saw Old Master Chen, he had already treated old master Chen as his own grandfather. ”

“Therefore, for so many years, no matter what request Chen Ai Sheng made, as long as it was not excessive, song Shiyu would agree to it for old master Chen’s sake. ”

“Old Master Chen’s face was filled with emotion as he continued, “So many years have passed in the blink of an eye!” ”

“That’s right.”Song Shiyu’s expression was a little heavy when he recalled the past. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Old Master Chen turned to look at song Shiyu at this time. “Shiyu, thank you for helping our Chen family all these years!” ”

“”You don’t have to stand on ceremony with me,”song Shiyu said. ”

“Old Master Chen had a rough idea in his mind, then, he said, “Shiyu, I’m already in my twilight years. I might leave that day. To tell you the truth, I still have something on my mind that I don’t have anymore. Before that, I won’t feel at ease even if I close my eyes.” ”

Old Master Chen was very clear about song Shiyu’s character. He knew that some things had to be done step by step. He couldn’t just get straight to the point.

“Hearing that, song Shiyu continued, “There are always some regrets in life. Actually, Old Master Chen, you don’t have to think so much. The most important thing for you now is to take care of your body.” ”

“If it were any other time, song Shiyu would definitely ask him what his regrets were, but today, song Shiyu actually did not ask! ”

This was a little strange!

“Old Master Chen was stunned for a moment. “Actually, I don’t have any regrets. If you are willing to help, Shiyu, you can still complete it.” ”

“Since song Shiyu did not reply, he could only complete his sentence once and for all. It was not the same to keep it a secret. ”

“Song Shiyu said, “Old Master Chen, you think too highly of me. There are nine out of ten things that go wrong in life. I can’t handle everything.” ”

“Although he did not know what Old Master Chen’s ultimate goal was, song Shiyu could feel that the matter that old master Chen needed his help with was definitely not a small matter. ”

“Old Master Chen put down his Teacup. “Shiyu, let me tell you something from the bottom of my heart. Only you can accomplish this matter.” ”

“Having said that, song shiyu could only continue, “Please speak.” ”

“Old Master Chen sighed. “Shiyu, can you promise grandfather first?” ”

“Song Shiyu furrowed his brows without leaving a trace. “Old Master Chen, I’ll do my best.” ”

“Hearing that, elder Chen smiled and said, “I’m relieved to hear that from you. Actually, this matter might be a good thing for you.” ”

This was a good thing in the first place.

“Now that the ratio of men and women was seriously out of balance, it was very difficult for an ordinary family to marry a daughter-in-law. ”

“He was now taking the initiative to tell song Shiyu about his granddaughter. If it was successful, it would be a blessing from heaven. ”

“If song Shiyu had any brains, he would know that this was not a bad thing. ”

“Song Shiyu did not answer old master Chen directly. Instead, he said, “Please go ahead.” ”

“Old Master Chen hesitated for a moment. “Shiyu, you’re thirty years old this year, and Yaoyao is twenty-eight years old. You’ve known each other since you were young. You were childhood sweethearts, and the two of you are innocent. That Girl Yaoyao really likes you very much...” ”

“At this point, grandfather Chen paused, then, he continued, “I’m Yaoyao’s grandfather. I’ve watched you grow up since you were young. I’m absolutely assured of your character! “Why don’t I, as your grandfather, pull some strings? Let’s Find a date and settle your Yaoyao’s marriage! “Actually, I’ve already looked at the almanac for those who are here. The 28th of next month is not bad. Why Don’t you two get engaged on the 28th?” ”

“After saying that, Old Master Chen looked at song Shiyu with anticipation. ”

“Song Shiyu’s expression did not change much. After a while, he continued, “Old Master Chen, thank you for thinking so highly of me, but I really can’t match up to Miss Chen.” ”
