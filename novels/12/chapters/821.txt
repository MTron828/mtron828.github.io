Ten minutes later.

“Cen Shaoqing walked over with two big buckets of popcorn and ice coke in his hands. “Leader, let’s go.””

“So Fast?”Ye Zhuo raised his eyes slightly and took one of the buckets of popcorn.

The two of them walked towards the broadcast hall together.

“This horror movie was very popular. When Ye Zhuo bought the tickets, only the second row in front had seats left. Because it was a horror movie, most of the people who came to watch it were couples.”

“As soon as the two of them sat down, they heard the discussions around them.” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“I heard that this horror film is super scary. Many people were scared to tears.”

“”If you’re scared, hug me later.””

“Is this horror film really that scary?”

“Don’t be scared. I’m still by your side.”

“Cen Shaoqing turned to look at ye Zao and said in a low voice, “Leader, are you scared?””

Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly. “What’s there to be afraid of?”

“Cen Shaoqing extended his arm in front of ye Zao. “If you’re afraid, you can bite me.””

“”Don’t worry, you’re very brave.””

“Not long after, the movie started.”

“Just as the movie started, there was a terrifying ghostly face. It struggled to crawl out from the screen. Because it was 3D, the effect was very realistic.”

Everyone was screaming in fear.

Some of the little girls even sat on their boyfriends’legs.

“When they looked at ye Zao again, there was not even a hint of emotion on his face. It was as if he was watching some love idol drama.”

Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly.

This seemed to be a little different from what he had thought.

Didn’t they say that little girls were afraid of ghosts?

How could ye Zao be so calm?

He wasn’t afraid.

There was something very scary about “Ghost next door.”He heard that even grown men were scared.

He didn’t believe that ye Zao wouldn’t be scared.

“Seeing that the movie was about to reach its scariest moment, Cen Shaoqing’s heart was beating a little fast.”

He was looking forward to ye Zao’s next reaction.

Although ye Zao was indeed very powerful.

“She was, after all, just a little girl.”

Little girls were born with this kind of fear towards ghosts.

Cen Shaoqing looked up the guide on the Internet.

Almost 100% of the girls in the country were afraid of ghosts.

“Three, two, one.”

“Finally, it was the most terrifying time.”

Cen Shaoqing sat up straight and waited for ye Zao to throw himself into his arms.

“Ah!”

“When the female ghost in red with a long tongue suddenly jumped out of the screen, the entire theater exploded.”

The male and female voices were mixed together. The young lady sitting next to Cen Shaoqing had long jumped into her boyfriend’s arms and was so scared that she cried out loud.

“Cen Shaoqing curled the corners of his mouth slightly. If it was not unexpected, ye Zhuo must have been scared out of his wits. Thinking of this, Cen Shaoqing sat up straight and waited for ye Zhuo’s next reaction.”

“At this moment, ye Zhuo slightly looked back at Cen Shaoqing. There was some doubt in his clear eyes. “What are they shouting?””

What were they shouting?

Cen Shaoqing did not expect ye Zao to react like this. He slowed down and opened his thin lips.”... maybe it was too scary?”

“Was it really scary just now?”Ye Zao was even more confused.

“In Ye Zao’s opinion, when the red-dressed female ghost jumped out from the screen, it was just a 50 cents special effect.”

Cen Shaoqing’s expression was the same as usual. “It was alright. It wasn’t that scary.”

Ye Zhuo turned around and continued watching the movie.

Cen Shaoqing took a sip of coke to calm himself down.

His girlfriend might be different from other people’s girlfriends... ...

“Two hours later, the movie ended.”

Almost all the makeup on most of the girls’faces had been ruined.

“After watching the movie, the two of them found a place to eat.”

...

The Lin family.

“During this period of time, not only did Old Lady Lin Start eating vegetarian food, she also set up a Buddhist temple in her spare room. She spent most of her time in the temple.”

“She had done too many wrong things in the first half of her life, and in the second half of her life, she hoped that she could atone for some of her sins.”

“The person she was most worried about right now was Lin Qingxuan, and she was also very regretful. When Lin Qingxuan had decided to be together with Xia Xiaoman, she should have given her blessings...”

“Old Madam Lin came to the east courtyard again. “Jin Cheng, have you spoken to Qingxuan on the phone these past few days?””

“Lin Jincheng saw the changes in Old Mrs. Lin during this period of time. “Mom, I’ve talked to fourth brother. He and fourth sister-in-law will be back next week.””

“Really?”Old Mrs. Lin asked in surprise.

“It’s true.”Lin Jincheng nodded. “Fourth brother told me personally last night that they will be back next week.”

“Old Mrs. Lin immediately asked, “Then when will they be back?””

“”I heard from fourth brother that they seem to have bought tickets for Tuesday,”Lin Jincheng replied.”

“”Okay.”Old Lady Lin held Lin Jincheng’s hand, her eyes slightly red. “Jincheng, thank you.””
