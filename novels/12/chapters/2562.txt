“Okay.”

“Little Zhao got up from his chair after finishing his work. “Weiwei, let’s go. Shall we go to the pet shop first?””

“Yes.”

The two of them went to the pet shop.

The lady boss was very happy when she saw Weiwei coming over. “Weiwei is back! Are you here to take Wangfu and Wangcai Back?”

“”Yes.”Weiwei even brought a gift for the lady boss. “Aunt Zixuan, I’ve settled down overseas. This time, I’m here to help Wangfu and Wangcai go abroad.””

“”Good, good, good. Don’t worry about going abroad. I know the procedures very well. Just leave it to me.”Zhang Zixuan continued, “Besides the overseas procedures and fees, there’s still a lot of money left from the last transfer. I’ll transfer it to you from Alipay.””

“Zhang Zixuan had been worried about Weiwei for the past few days. Now that Weiwei was finally back, Zhang Zixuan was relieved.”

“”Okay.”Weiwei gave the gift to Zhang Zixuan. “Aunt Zixuan, this is for you. I wish you a prosperous business and a prosperous day.””

“”Thank you.”Zhang Zixuan took the gift with both hands and said with a smile, “This child is too polite! By the way, who is this?””

“Weiwei said, “An elder sister in the family.””

Zhang Zixuan nodded with a smile. “It’s been so long. I finally met your relative.”

Weiwei smiled as well.

Little Zhao’s mood suddenly turned heavy.

Weiwei was so young. How many heavy things had she shouldered.

“After negotiating with Zhang Zixuan, Little Zhao sent Weiwei to the airport.”

“After all, the child was only a teenager. Little Zhao asked worriedly, “Weiwei, can you go alone?””

“”I’m fine.”Weiwei smiled and said, “Someone from country M picked me up.””

“Is that person reliable?”Little Zhao asked.

Vivi nodded. “He’s my chief editor.”

“”As long as he’s reliable,”little Zhao said, “You’re young. You’re alone out there. No matter what happens, you have to be careful. Don’t be deceived. If you encounter anything, remember to send me a message immediately!””

“”Okay.”Vivi continued to nod. “Thank you, Sister Zhao.””

“”You’re welcome!”Zhao patted Vivi’s head. “If you don’t mind, you can treat me as your sister in the future.””

“Okay.”Vivi smiled.

Zhao told Vivi a lot of things and watched her walk into the boarding gate before he left.

The plane to M Nation landed on time nine hours later.

Vivi’s English was good and she did not encounter any difficulties along the way.

“Just as she walked out of the gate, she saw the editor-in-chief waving at her.”

“”Vivi, this way!””

Vivi pulled her suitcase and jogged over.

“Sister Linda.”

Linda took her suitcase. “I’ve already arranged a place for you to live next door to me.”

“”Thank you, Sister Linda.””

“”You’re welcome.”Linda continued to ask, “Have you settled all the domestic matters?””

“Yes.”

Linda nodded. “You should rest for three months first. Don’t be in a hurry to write a serial. Wait until your body recovers before you start writing.”

“Okay.”

“Looking at the obedient, sensible and talented vivi, Linda really wanted to have another daughter.”

...

On the other side.

“When Liu Meilian returned to the hospital again, she found out that Vivi had already been discharged.”

Discharged!

“Liu Meilian said in surprise, “Why didn’t anyone inform me that my daughter was discharged?””

“The patient discharged herself.”

“Liu Meilian continued, “But I’m her guardian! Where did my daughter go?””

“”Sorry, I’m not too sure about that either.””

Liu Meilian immediately took out her phone and dialed Weiwei’s number.

“Although it was late at night in Country M, Weiwei quickly picked up.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“”Weiwei, where did you go? Mom was worried sick about you!””

“”I went abroad,”weiwei continued, “Ms. Liu, strictly speaking, I’m not your daughter. Zhou Si and Zhou Zhe are your children. I’m very grateful to you for choosing to give birth to me back then. I’ve already returned this favor to you. In the future, we don’t owe each other anything, and we won’t see each other again! That’s all.””

“After saying that, Vivi hung up the phone.”

Liu Meilian was stunned.

What did Vivi mean by this?

It seemed that Vivi had been acting with her all these days?

She said that she had already returned the favor of giving birth to her.

“Could it be that she had transferred 15,000 yuan, bought a piano for Zhou Si, and a few broken toys for Zhou Zhe? And then two red envelopes?”

“But these things added up only amounted to about 100,000 yuan.”

What was this?
