Zhao Pingting immediately pulled open the curtain and went to ask the patient in the ward.

“Hearing what Zhao Pingting said, an old man surnamed Xue raised his hand. “Young lady, I want to try.” ”

“”I won’t try,”said the middle-aged woman who lived in the bed next to Zhao Pingting. ”

She was only in her fifties this year.

She did not want to die early.

Ye Zhuo looked too young. She could not believe ye Zhuo.

“”I don’t want to try anymore either.”Seeing the middle-aged woman say that she did not want to try anymore, the young woman who lived in the hospital bed in the innermost part of the room shook her head. ”

“Because of the chemotherapy, all her hair had fallen out. ”

Her face was very weak.

“Even so, she still wanted to survive. ”

She still had an eight-year-old daughter waiting for her to return.

“”Young lady, Count me in. I want to try too,”said the woman on the hospital bed to Zhao Pingting’s right. ”

The woman looked very thin.

“She did not usually talk much and liked to stare out of the window in a daze most of the time, ”

“Okay.”Zhao pingting nodded.

Ye Zhuo counted the number of people and sent it to Gu Dening.

“Not long after, Gu Dening and the nurse brought the medicine to the ward. The medicine was not taken orally. It needed to be injected into the body through an infusion. ”

“”Miss Ye, the medicine is ready.” ”

Ye Zhuo nodded. “Let’s begin.”

“There were a total of five people in the ward, and two of them refused treatment. When the nurse was giving the other three injections, the other two people gathered around curiously and muttered. ”

“Why is the Medicine Green?”

“Will it really work?”

“”Uncle Wang, why don’t you stop trying? We still have a chance to survive, but if we try...”the rest was self-evident. ”

“Uncle Wang chuckled. “It’s fine, it’s fine. I’m old enough anyway! I’m not even afraid of a 19-year-old girl, what’s there to be afraid of an old man like me?” ”

“Hearing uncle Wang’s words, the middle-aged woman could not say anything more. ”

Everyone had their own fate.

“This was their own path, and they could not be persuaded by others. ”

The next day.

The news that Zhao Pingting and the two patients in the same ward had already used the medicine that ye Zao had developed spread throughout the hospital.

“Have you heard? That YKA medicine has already been used on the patients!”

“”If something goes wrong, that’s three lives!” ”

“Coincidentally, Gu Dening arrived at the office at this time. Someone asked, “Xiao Gu, you’re too bold! You really dare to use this kind of unauthenticated medicine on the patients?” ”

“GU dening said, “Who said there was no test? Miss Ye and I repeated the experiment more than a dozen times and decided to give it to the patient after we confirmed that there was no problem.” ”

Gu dening was not the kind of person who was careless.

“What will you do if the patient shows signs of rejection?”

“Gu dening continued, “Miss Ye has already thought about this problem. Don’t worry. The three patients have been using it for more than 12 hours. There hasn’t been any rejection so far.” ”

“”There are no problems at the moment, but that doesn’t mean there won’t be problems in the future! Little Gu, I advise you to be prepared to run away at any time!” ”

“When she said this, everyone chimed in. ”

“Gu dening smiled and said, “Don’t worry, this won’t happen.” ”

Everyone was waiting to see Gu dening make a fool of herself.

“However, a week passed. ”

“Not only did the patient not show any signs of rejection, the cancer cells in her body had also decreased significantly. ”

Today was the day for Zhao Pingting and the other two patients to undergo surgery.

Ye Zhuo was the chief surgeon.

Gu dening was the assistant beside him.

The entire process of the surgery was recorded by a video camera at the side.

Ye Zhuo explained to Gu dening as he performed the surgery.

“She did not speak much and spoke very succinctly. However, every word she said hit the nail on the head. She did not utter a single word. ” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Because it was only a small surgery, it ended in an hour. ”

“As soon as the surgery door opened, Zhao Pingting’s parents, Zhao Yingjun, and Tang Jia surrounded her. “Miss Ye, how is Pingting?” ”

“”Don’t worry, uncle and Auntie. The surgery went very smoothly.” ”

“Although Zhao Pingting’s surgery was over, there were still two patients who needed ye Zhuo to personally perform the surgery. Therefore, she did not follow the Zhao family to the ward. Instead, she prepared the second patient’s surgery with Gu Dening. ”

At two o’clock in the afternoon.

All the surgeries were over.

“Ye Zhuo took off his white coat and went to Zhao Pingting’s ward. “Pingting, how do you feel now? Does the incision still hurt?” ”

“Zhao pingting smiled and said, “It’s just a minimally invasive surgery. It doesn’t hurt at all.” ”

“”That’s good.”Ye Zhuo nodded. “If you feel uncomfortable, you must tell the nurse immediately.” ”
