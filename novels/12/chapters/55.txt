Chapter 56: How Is This Possible!

The person standing in front of the door that was kicked open was Yi Tao. Who else could it be?

Yi Tao was fine!

He was absolutely fine!

He was still standing there.

Was this an illusion?

One had to know that Yi Tao had been lying on the bed for almost a year.

Li Qingyue’s hands that were hidden in her sleeves were clenched into fists, and her face was pale.

‘Isn’t Yi Tao dead?

‘Ye Zhuo cured Yi Tao?

‘How is this possible!

‘Isn’t Ye Zhuo a good-for-nothing?’

Moreover, she had seen the prescription that Ye Zhuo prescribed last time. The medicine had no effect on Yi Tao’s illness at all.

What was going on?

Yi Tao walked over step by step and knelt in front of Yi Xuezheng and Li Wenru. “Mom and Dad! Please forgive me for being so unfilial! I’ve made you two worried during this period.”

The couple finally reacted. They immediately knelt down on the ground and hugged Yi Tao excitedly. “Tao Tao! Tao Tao! It’s really you!”

Only when they hugged Yi Tao did Yi Xuezheng and Li Wenru believe that it was true.

This was really their son!

“Tao Tao! Are you really alright?” Li Wenru sized up Yi Tao from head to toe. It felt like she was dreaming.

She remembered that just a month ago, her son was still lying weakly on the bed. Even speaking was a luxury.

Now, not only was he alright, he even stood up!

Yi Xuezheng also felt that it was unbelievable. He looked up and down at Yi Tao.

Yi Tao stood up and turned around on the spot. “Dad, Mom, look, I’m fine now!”

Although Yi Tao was still very thin, it was clear that his mental state was very good.

He did not look like a patient at all!

Even a man like Yi Xuezheng couldn’t help but wipe away his tears when he saw Yi Tao like this.

During the days when his son was sick, he seemed fine, but in fact, he was worried every day. After all, Yi Tao was the only heir of the Yi family.

He had been in a car accident before, so he was no longer able to have children.

If Yi Tao was gone, then their family would be wiped out.

Li Wenru was so excited that she put her palms together and knelt on the ground, kowtowing. “Bodhisattva’s blessing! It’s really Bodhisattva’s blessing! Thank God! Thank you for returning Tao Tao to me.”

“Mom!” Yi Tao smiled and got up. “I only got better after taking Miss Ye’s medicine. What does it have to do with Bodhisattva and God?”

As he said that, Yi Tao pulled Chen Qiaoye over. “And it’s thanks to Qiaoye! If it wasn’t for Qiaoye insisting that I take Miss Ye’s medicine, I might have given up on myself!”

Li Wenru grabbed Chen Qiaoye’s hand and said with red eyes, “Good girl! Good girl! It’s mom’s fault! I’m sorry! Mom almost hurt you. Qiaoye, can you forgive Mom? I promise I won’t do that again!”

Thinking of the past, Li Wenru felt ashamed and regretful.

She wished she could slap the old her to death!

If the daughter-in-law of hers hadn’t insist on giving Yi Tao the medicine because of her fierce objection, the consequences would be one that she wouldn’t dare to imagine.

It was all her fault!

“I’m sorry, child! Dad also let you down.” Thinking of how he kicked the door open in anger, Yi Xuezheng also felt regretful.

He shouldn’t have wronged Chen Qiaoye without any proof.

Hearing these words, Chen Qiaoye felt that the grievances she had suffered these past few days were all worth it.

Chen Qiaoye smiled and said, “Dad, Mom, we are all family. It’s too much to apologize to each other as a family. I know that you did was out of concern for Yi Tao’s good, so I have never blamed you.”

Hearing this, Li Wenru felt even more ashamed.

Her daughter-in-law was so good, and as a mother-in-law, she didn’t have half the tolerance of her daughter-in-law.

She really shouldn’t have!

In the future, she would definitely treat Chen Qiaoye as her own daughter.

Li Wenru hugged Chen Qiaoye and said loudly, “Good child, our Tao Tao is lucky to be able to marry you!”

Then, Li Wenru and Yi Xuezheng decided to go to the Ye family to thank Ye Zhuo. If it wasn’t for Ye Zhuo, there wouldn’t be the current Yi Tao.

Ye Zhuo hadn’t just saved Yi Tao, she had saved the entire Ye family.

Li Wenru was feeling very regretful now.

She shouldn’t have blindly believed the words of others.

Even the famous professor couldn’t do anything about Yi Tao’s illness, but Ye Zhuo had cured it in only a month. How could such a person be a piece of trash?

Li Qingyue stood quietly by the side. She felt like an outsider, her hands and feet cold.

She thought of that night many years ago.

Her father was gone, and so was her mother.

She was an orphan that no one wanted.

Why didn’t Yi Tao die!

As long as Yi Tao didn’t die, there would be no place for her in the Yi family.

The Yi family’s property was hers, and so was the Yi Corporation!

No one could take away what belonged to her!

At this moment, Li Wenru turned to look at Li Qingyue. “Qingyue, you can go back first. Your uncle and I are heading over to Miss Ye’s place!”

Li Qingyue squeezed out a smile. “Aunt, I will go with you. In the past, I also had some misunderstandings about Miss Ye. This time, I also want to properly apologize to her.”

To know one’s own strength and the enemy’s was the sure way to victory. This time, she wanted to find out everything about Ye Zhuo!

Li Wenru nodded. “Okay, let’s go together.”

Usually, Ye Zhuo would not be at home during the day, but she had to report to school this afternoon, so Ye Zhuo did not go to the restaurant to help out.

She changed into her school uniform and was about to head out when Yi Tao and Chen Qiaoye arrived.

Seeing Yi Tao and Chen Qiaoye, Ye Zhuo was stunned. “Mr. and Mrs. Yi?”

“Miss Ye,” Chen Qiaoye smiled and continued, “My parents wanted to thank you in person, so we’re here again.”

As soon as she said this, Li Wenru walked up from behind and grabbed Ye Zhuo’s hand excitedly. “Miss Ye! Miracle Doctor Ye! Thank you for curing my son’s illness. Thank you, you’re the savior of our Yi Family!”

Yi Xuezheng also walked up, took off his hat, and bowed deeply, “Miss Ye! Thank you!”

“Uncle and Auntie, you are too polite! Mr. and Mrs. Yi has already thanked me yesterday.” Ye Zhuo then invited everyone into the house.

Li Qingyue walked at the back, and looked around the house silently. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

After entering the house, Li Wenru and Yi Xuezheng said a lot of words of gratitude to Zhuo Ye.

Li Qingyue stood up and apologized to Ye Zhuo, “Miss Ye, I’m sorry. I misunderstood you before and even doubted your medical skills. Now that I think about it, it’s really inappropriate. Please forgive me!”

Ye Zhuo smiled faintly, “Everyone makes mistakes. Miss Li, don’t take it to heart.”

Li Qingyue heaved a sigh of relief.

This young lady had forgiven her so easily. It seemed that Ye Zhuo was not as smart as she thought.

After saying that, Ye Zhuo turned to look at Li Wenru, “Uncle and Aunt, I still have a few things to tell you about Mr. Yi’s illness. Can you come with me?”

“Sure.” Li Wenru and Yi Xuezheng immediately stood up and followed Ye Zhuo’s footsteps.

When they arrived at Ye Zhuo’s bedroom, she closed the door behind her.

Seeing Ye Zhuo’s actions, Li Wenru panicked. “Miss Ye, is our child, Tao Tao’s illness getting serious again? Just tell me directly, I can take it…”

Ye Zhuo shook her head. “Don’t worry. Mr. Yi’s illness is no longer a problem, but…”

At this point, she changed the topic and continued, “His illness is definitely not a coincidence. The Annox disease has only ever appeared once before in this world. If you don’t get rid of the bad seed that’s hiding in your family, I can guarantee that Mr. Yi will definitely not live past the age of 35!”
