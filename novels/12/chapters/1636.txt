“Chapter 1637: 333: successfully landed on Neptune, face-smacking! 5”

Translator: 549690339

Just as ye Zao finished his sentence.

Bang!

“A loud sound suddenly came from 10,000 meters high in the sky, and a monstrous red light dyed half of the sky. ”

“Dr. Cara looked up at the sky, his face full of disbelief. ”

How did he do it?

How did ye Zao do it?

Could it be that ye Zao could really create an aircraft carrier that surpassed the speed of light?

The others did not understand what was happening and were all confused.

“Professor Cara tried his best to calm himself down and avoided this topic. He continued, “Professor YC, when will you let us see what is the speed of Light?” ”

He did not believe that ye Zao could really surpass the speed of light!

“”Okay, then I will let you see it for yourself.”Ye Zao pressed the Start button on the screen. ”

Beep —

“[ the aircraft carrier has activated its light speed mode. The destination is Neptune. The entire journey is 4.5 billion kilometers. Estimated time of landing, 14:28 p.m. on May 18, year 21! ] ”

“As soon as the electronic voice faded, the behemoth that was still in midair turned into a beam of light and disappeared in an instant. ”

“Where’s the aircraft carrier?”

“Miss Ye!”

“Oh my God! The aircraft carrier has disappeared!”

Almost all the audience members stood up and looked at the scene in disbelief.

“If they had not seen it with their own eyes, no one would believe that it was real! ”

“Including Dr. Cara, everyone stood up with shocked expressions on their faces. ”

Dr. Cara turned to look at David. “Quick! Go and investigate! The Chinese are the best at playing tricks! YC must have arranged it in advance and hidden the aircraft carrier!”

“Cara had been in the research field for more than 30 years and had only studied the speed of light for more than 10 years. He had never believed that humans had the power to surpass the speed of light, nor did he believe that a young girl in her 20s had such terrifying power. ”

It was fake.

It must be fake.

The live bullet screen was also stunned.

“Holy shit! Where’s the aircraft carrier? What is this YC doing?”

“Did she really exceed the speed of light and fly to Neptune?”

“”The speed of light was only an instant. If YC really created an aircraft carrier that surpassed the speed of light, she would have already flown out of Earth by now.” ”

“”Exceed the speed of light? Impossible! If she could really exceed the speed of light, then she would be able to travel through time and space.” ”

“”Yes, it must be fake. Maybe this is just a diversion.” ”

[ Chinese people love to do this kind of trickery. It’s normal to use a diversion. ]

“[ if it’s a diversion, then go and make a diversion for us to see! Sour grapes when you can’t eat grapes! You Chinese people are disgusting! ] ”

“[ if it’s not a diversion, then it can only mean one thing! YC has really created the world’s first aircraft carrier that can go faster than the speed of light! ] ”

“[ ha! That’s easy to say, how is that possible! ] ” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“[ whether it’s true or not, we’ll know when the aircraft carrier lands. Didn’t YC claim to be bringing back a diamond from Neptune? ] ”

“[ if it’s true, why is the big screen black? Didn’t YC say to record the entire broadcast? Why didn’t she let us see what the universe was like and what outer space was like? Liar! Disgusting! ] ”

[ the person above is right! What happened to recording? Why is there no follow-up? ]

[ because she just found a place to hide. There’s no speed of light at all. Where can she film outer space and the Universe for you guys? ]

“[ I looked around. If you want to go to Neptune, you have to go through Mars first, then Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and finally Neptune. If you have the ability, quickly send all these videos over! ] ”

At this moment.

The loudspeaker in the square suddenly rang.

“”Master Five, can you hear me?”It was Cen Jiang’s voice. ”

“Hearing Cen Jiang’s voice, CEN Shaoqing immediately dialed the microphone in front of the table. “I can hear you. How are things on Your Side?” ”

“”We’re fine. Miss Ye is also fine. You Don’t have to worry,”Cen Jiang continued. “Master five, we’ve already flown out of earth and are about to reach Mars. Now, I’ll show you the situation on our side.” ”

“As he finished speaking, Cen Jiang switched the camera. ”

“In the next second, the big screen displayed the scenery of outer space! ”

The dark and boundless universe was filled with mystery.

“Mars, which was just a short distance away, was emitting an orange glow. It was extremely similar to an orange giant ball. From the camera, one could even see the desolate surface of Mars. ”

“Whether it was the audience before the live broadcast or the audience sitting in the square, this was the first time they had seen such a scene. ”
