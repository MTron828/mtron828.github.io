Cen Shaoqing:”...”

“If it were someone else’s grandmother, when something like this happened, she would definitely think of a way to protect her grandson. ”

“But when it came to Old Lady Cen, things changed! ”

“Not only did she not want to protect him, she even wanted to ‘expose’him in front of ye Zhuo! ”

Was he really not picked up by Old Lady Cen?

Cen Shaoqing looked up at the sky and pinched his temples.

“”See, there’s nothing to say, right? Don’t deny it! You’re feeling guilty now!”Seeing Cen Shaoqing like this.., old Mrs. Cen said with great heartache, “I was really blind back then, that’s why I introduced Ye Zi to you! If I had known this would happen, I would have taken Ye Zi as my godgranddaughter!” ”

Cen Shaoqing’s expression was as usual as he looked at Old Mrs. Cen.

“Seeing that he remained silent, old Mrs. Cen was even angrier. She raised her foot and kicked him. “Why didn’t you explain yourself? Are You Mute?” ”

“Cen Shaoqing then said gently, “There’s nothing to explain. Grandma, You’ve misunderstood.” ”

“Misunderstood? What did I misunderstand? I heard it with my own ears! Didn’t you have someone build a golden house?”Old Mrs. Cen asked back.

“Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips opened slightly, “The ‘Jiao’in the Golden House refers to Empress Chen Ajiao, not some random person.” ”

“So?”Old Mrs. Cen asked.

“”So, you misunderstand. Things are not what you think,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen narrowed her eyes and finally understood the meaning of Cen Shaoqing’s words. She continued, “You mean, you want to build a golden house and hide the leaves inside?” ”

“Of course.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Upon hearing this, old Mrs. Cen’s eyes lit up and she continued, “This idea is not bad! You Little Brat, you’ve finally understood!”You even know how to build a golden house to make girls happy! ”

“After saying this, old MRS. CEN said again, “Do you have enough gold mines there? If not, I still have more!” ”

“Enough.”

“Old Mrs. Cen said, “If it’s not enough, remember to tell Grandma.” ”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

The housekeeper at the side:”...”

“Judging from the serious looks of the old and young, they were not really going to build a gold house, right? ”

The two of them walked into the house. Ye Zhuo had almost finished the dessert on the table.

Old Mrs. Cen ordered the kitchen to serve the dishes that had been prepared.

“After eating, ye Zao said, “Oh Right, Grandma Cen, three days later, I’m going on a trip to the grassland with Cen Shaoqing. You should come along too.” ”

“Hearing that, old Mrs. Cen shook her head without thinking. “No! I’m not going! I’m Old and can’t be bothered to run around! You should go with Shaoqing! You two have fun!” ”

“The two of them were very busy. It was not easy for them to go on a trip together, so why was she following them? ”

Was she a high voltage?

She did not want to!

Ye Zhuo held old Mrs. Cen’s arm. “It’s a rare opportunity. You can go with us. We’ll be back before the New Year’s Eve!”

“”I’m not going.”Old Mrs. Cen continued, “I plan to go to your aunt’s place in a few days. The grassland is too cold. Your Aunt’s place is better. It’s neither cold nor hot. “And I haven’t been to your aunt’s place for a long time.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

At the Xu Residence.

“After Xu Yao washed up and dressed, she went downstairs. ”

She wore a light black long dress and a beige coat. She looked very ladylike.

He ziteng was waiting at the entrance of the Xu Residence’s villa.

Mother Xu stood on the balcony on the third floor and looked at he ziteng carefully. Her face was full of satisfaction.

“He ziteng’s family background, looks, and looks were simply the best choice for a son-in-law. ”

“Mother Xu took out her phone and took a photo, sending it to the wechat group of Mahjong players. ”

This group was filled with the wives of the circle of wives.

“Usually, apart from playing mahjong together, they also liked to compare themselves. ”

“For example, whose son married the daughter of which family, whose son studied abroad... ”

“In the past, mother Xu did not have much of a presence in the circle of wives. After all, the Xu family was not considered outstanding among the wealthy families. Moreover, the person in charge of the Xu family was Xu Chaonan. ”

But it was different now!

He ziteng was now her future son-in-law!

What made mother Xu most proud was that it was he ziteng who took the initiative to pursue Xu Yao.

“Among the group’s wives’daughters, who had been pursued by he ziteng? ”

“Not being pursued by He ziteng was one thing, but there were quite a number of people who took the initiative to pursue he ziteng. ”

“Therefore, mother Xu was very popular in the group these days. ”
