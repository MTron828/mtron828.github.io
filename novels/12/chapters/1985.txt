“”Address,”Cen Shaoqing said concisely. ”

“”Haina Resort Island,”the assistant answered. ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “You can go out first.”

“Yes.”The assistant bowed and left the office.

“After the assistant left, Cen Shaoqing sat in the boss’s chair with his eyes half-closed. In a moment, he pinched his temples and made a call. “Hello, Mom.” ”

“Hearing Cen Shaoqing’s voice, Zhou Xiang was stunned. After a long while, he said, “Really, really?” ”

“”Yes,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

“”Okay, I’ll be there right away.”Zhou Xiang hung up the phone. ”

“An hour later, Zhou Xiang rushed to the CEN base and came to the office. “Shaoqing!” ”

“Zhou Xiang’s expression was still calm, but there was a sobbing tone in her voice. ”

She had waited for more than thirty years.

From the prime of her life until she was over fifty years old.

“Mom.”Cen Shaoqing stood up from the chair.

“Where’s the Thing?”Zhou Xiang tried her best to calm herself down and looked at Cen Shaoqing.

Cen Shaoqing handed the thing to Zhou Xiang. “It’s here.”

Zhou Xiang took the thing.

“At this moment, her hands were trembling, and hot tears rolled down her cheeks. ”

“Haifeng...”

Zhou Xiang pressed the parts of the boat tightly against her chest.

After a long time.

Zhou Xiang finally composed herself and turned to look at Cen Shaoqing. “Shaoqing.”

“Mom.”Cen Shaoqing looked at Zhou Xiang.

“Zhou Xiang continued, “Have you found your father’s whereabouts?” ”

“Not yet.”Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips parted slightly.

“Where did you find that thing?”

“Cen Shaoqing replied, “Haina Resort Island.” ”

“After saying that.., cEN Shaoqing continued, “Mom, it’s been so many years. The sea is stormy and the waves are strong. We don’t even know where this thing came from. Even if you went to Haina resort island, it wouldn’t be of any help...” ”

More than 30 years had passed. Perhaps the ship had malfunctioned during the yaw.

No one knew where the shipwreck was.

“”I know everything you said, but I just want to take a look.”Zhou Xiang took a deep breath and continued, “Have you investigated the shipwreck?” ”

“”Not yet,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

“Zhou Xiang nodded slightly and took the parts of the shipwreck. “Well, I’ll go back first.” ” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“I’ll send you back.”Cen Shaoqing picked up his coat from the chair and followed his mother’s footsteps.

“No need.”Zhou Xiang turned to look at Cen Shaoqing. “I’m fine.”

“Speaking up to this point, Zhou Xiang raised a smile. “It’s been so many years. What could have happened to me? If something had happened, I wouldn’t have persisted until now.” ”

“Although Zhou Xiang said so, Cen Shaoqing was still worried. He took the car keys and said, “I’ll send you back.” ”

Zhou Xiang looked at Cen Shaoqing’s face and nodded.

“Soon, the mother and son arrived at the parking lot. ”

“Along the way, Zhou Xiang held the box in her arms and did not say a word. ”

“Although it had been more than thirty years, this was the first time she had faced her husband’s death so directly. ”

“After all, before this, the sunken ship that was involved in the accident had not been salvaged, and no remains had been found. ”

“Although the CEN family had set up a cenotaph for Cen Haifeng and announced his death, Zhou Xiang could still see a glimmer of hope before she saw the remains. ”

“Nothing had happened to the ship back then. It had only been dragged into some unknown time and space, or the ship had been controlled by someone. ”

“As long as there was hope before the remains of the ship were found, it would be there. ”

But now.

“The remains of the boat surfaced, and her last hope was gone. ”

“Looking at the expressionless Zhou Xiang in the rearview mirror, Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly. ”

Perhaps.

He had underestimated the feelings between his mother and father.

“He had thought that after so many years, his mother had long recovered from the accident, but now it seemed that. ”

She had not.

“No matter how many years it had been, the scar was still there. ”

Cen Shaoqing held the steering wheel with one hand. He used his hand that was holding the Buddha beads to pull out a tissue and handed it to Zhou Xiang.

Zhou Xiang took the tissue and wiped the tears from her face.

“As a mother, she did not want to cry in front of her son, but she could not control herself. ”

“Twenty minutes later, the car stopped at the entrance of the Cen family manor. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen was sitting in the living room listening to a play. When she saw Cen Shaoqing and Zhou Xiang coming back, she felt that something was not right. She stood up and said, “Xiang Xiang!” ”

“”Hey, Mom.”Zhou Xiang turned to look at Old Mrs. Cen. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen saw that something was wrong with Zhou Xiang. She turned down the radio. “Xiang Xiang, what’s Wrong?” ”
