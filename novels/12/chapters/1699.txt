“It just so happens that director Qian is looking for you. Let me help you take the call.”

“Okay.”Wu Jia Guo nodded.

On the other side.

“Qian you long called Wu Jia Guo, but Wu Jia Guo’s secretary said that Wu Jia Guo was busy and didn’t have time to pick up the phone. ”

“Wu Jia Guo didn’t pick up the phone, so Qian you long anxiously paced back and forth. ”

“At that moment, the phone on the desk rang. ”

Qian Youlong immediately picked up the phone. “Hello.”

“This is the Wu family.”

“Hearing the voice of the Wu family, Qian Youlong immediately breathed a sigh of relief. He then said, “Team leader Wu, I finally got in touch with you...” ”

“”We’ll talk about your matter later.”The Wu family continued, “Let me ask you, have ye Zhuo and Lin Sha been arrested?” ”

“Qian youlong said, “That’s what I wanted to talk to you about! Team leader Wu, we’ve really messed up! Come over to my side quickly!” ”

“What’s going on?”Wu Jiaguo frowned.

“Qian youlong continued, “Ye Zhuo’s information has the S-3 logo on it. Then she asked for you by name.” ”

Wu Jiaguo was stunned.

S-3?

“What did you say? Who is S3?”

“Qian youlong continued, “The one who offended Miss Zou.” ”

What? Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Ye Zao was s3?

Weren’t they just two very ordinary high school seniors?

How could this be?

“If they were really S3, then it would be troublesome. ”

“Wu Jiaguo took a deep breath and continued, “Are you sure it’s S3? Are you sure?” ”

“”Yes, I’m sure,”Qian Youlong continued, “I sent the number to your email. If you don’t believe me, you can check it.” ”

“Don’t hang up yet.”

Wu Jiaguo held the microphone in one hand and opened the email in the other. He copied the number and then opened the internal inquiry system to click on the query.

“Although it was only a few seconds, Wu Jiaguo’s heart was beating very fast. ”

No.

It definitely wasn’t an S 3.

“The next second, the results of the search were displayed on the computer screen. ”

Wu Jiaguo looked at the low-key S 3 on the logo and was instantly struck by lightning.

Sweat poured down like rain.

Blood flowed backwards all over his body.

Oh My God!

What stupid thing did he do.

“”Where-where is Miss ye Now?”At this moment, Wu Jiaguo’s voice was so funny. ”

Wu Jiaguo had never been so flustered in his long career.

Very flustered.

His mind was full of what to do now.

“Qian Youlong was not much better than Wu Jiaguo. He continued, “She’s still with me now. You, you should come over quickly!” ”

“”Okay, I’ll come over right away.”After hanging up the phone, Wu Jiaguo rushed over. ”

“Half an hour later, Wu Jiaguo reached his destination. ”

“At this moment, Wu Jiaguo did not look like a leader at all. In fact, he looked a little flustered. ”

“Qian Youlong stood at the door waiting for him. When he saw him coming over, he immediately went up to him. “Team leader Wu, you’re finally here! Miss ye is already waiting for you!” ”

Wu Jiaguo wiped his forehead with his sleeve and followed Qian Youlong’s footsteps.

“Ye Zhuo was still sitting on the chair in front of the interrogation table, with a cup of steaming tea beside him. ”

Wu Jiaguo took a deep breath and walked to ye Zhuo’s side. “Miss Ye.”

“Ye Zhuo raised his eyes indifferently. “Wu Jiaguo, right?” ”

“”Yes, I am.”Wu Jiaguo nodded repeatedly. ”

“Ye Zhuo’s voice was very faint, but every word was like a huge rock weighing a thousand pounds, pressing heavily on Wu Jiaguo’s body, making it difficult for him to breathe. ”

“At this moment, Wu Jiaguo had already greeted Zou Feifei and her mother a thousand times in his heart. ”

“If it weren’t for Zou Feifei, he wouldn’t be in such a dire situation. ”

“”Miss Ye, you, you, you misunderstood. I, I...”Wu Jiaguo was so nervous that he couldn’t even say a word. ”

“Ye Zhuo looked up slightly. “What are you stuttering about! When you were supporting the Zou mother and daughter, you didn’t think of this now?” ”

Wu Jiaguo almost lost his balance.

Qian Youlong was the same.

“However, his situation was slightly better than Wu Jiaguo’s. After all, he was only following Wu Jiaguo’s orders. ”

Everything else had nothing to do with him!

“Please give me another chance. I promise there won’t be a next time! Miss Ye!”

There was no expression in ye Zhuo’s eyes.

She was not some saint who was overflowing with sympathy.

Wu Jiaguo had brought this on himself.

There was no chance!

“”Miss Ye!”At this moment, a tall man in uniform walked over from outside the door. ”

Ye Zhuo stood up slightly. “I’m here.”

“The man smiled and said, “I came as soon as I received your call. I’m really sorry to have made you suffer.” ”
