Translator: 549690339

Zhao Pingting had a pretty good impression of Song Shiyu.

“He was gentle and polite, with handsome features and a modest personality. ”

“However, what made Zhao Pingting curious was why song Shiyu was still single even though he was not bad looking. ”

Could it be that song Shiyu was the same as Cen Shaoqing in the past and had seen through the secular world?

“Zhao Pingting moved a seat inside. “Brother Song, please take a seat.” ”

“Thank you.”Song Shiyu sat in Zhao Pingting’s seat.

Ye Zhuo called the waiter over. “I’d like another cup of green tea.”

“After saying that, she seemed to feel that something was amiss. She turned to look at Song Shiyu. “Brother song, is green tea okay?” ”

“Yes.”Song Shiyu nodded.

Ye Zhuo smiled at the waiter. “Then I’ll have another cup of green tea.”

“”Okay, please wait a moment.” ”

“An Lizi also put her bag away and smiled. “Great Zao, Pingting, do you know how boss song and I Met?” ”

“How did we meet?”Zhao Pingting’s face was full of curiosity.

Ye Zao held the green tea and opened his red lips. “Car accident.”

“Hearing this, an Lizi looked at ye Zao in surprise. ”

Even song Shiyu turned his eyes curiously.

“An Lizi widened her eyes. “D * MN! Zao Zao, you installed a surveillance camera on me!” ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Are you stupid? You said it yourself that there was a small friction with brother song’s car at the traffic light junction.” ”

An Lizi patted her head. “I think so.”

“After saying that, an Lizi smiled and looked at Zhao Pingting. “So Pingting is the idiot.” ”

Zhao Pingting was innocently blamed. “How am I Stupid?”

“An lizi continued, “How are you not stupid? When I said that there was a small friction with boss song’s car, you were there too. Even searing could guess that it was because of the car accident. You’re just like 250.” ”

Zhao Pingting scratched her head. “My reaction wasn’t as fast as searing.”

“That’s why you’re so silly.”

The two of them spoke one after another without any estrangement because they had not seen each other for a long time.

“Ye Zao took the menu and ordered a few dishes. Then, he handed the menu to song Shiyu. “Brother song, what do you want to eat?” ”

“”Let the two of them order first,”song Shiyu said. ”

Ye Zao shook his head. “There’s no need. I’ve ordered everything they like.”

“An lizi smiled and said, “Zhuo Zhuo understands the two of us very well.” ”

Only then did song Shiyu stretch out his hand to take the menu.

They were all very ordinary high-end dishes.

“They did not seem to have any special features, but there was already a long queue outside the door. ” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Song Shiyu added two more dishes. “That’s enough.”

“Very soon, the dishes were all served. ”

“Although there was now song Shiyu, the atmosphere of the conversation did not change at all. The three of them chatted and laughed, occasionally even giving song Shiyu a cue. ”

Song Shiyu was quite good at catching up.

“There was a boiling hot pot on the table. The red oil was boiling, and a few prawns were poured in. After about ten minutes, they were scooped out, fresh and refreshing. ”

Ye Zhuo ate three prawns in a row. “The prawns here are very delicious. Try Them.”

Zhao Pingting shook her head. “I don’t like to eat prawns.”

“Let me try.”An Lizi scooped up a prawns.

Song Shiyu was eating the fat cow in his bowl.

“An Lizi took a bite of the prawns. “The taste is really good. Boss song, you should try it too. The prawns won’t taste good when they’re too slippery.” ”

“Okay.”Song Shiyu scooped up a piece of prawns and slid it into the bowl.

“The round prawns were wrapped in a spicy dipping sauce. Not only were they smooth and refreshing, their lips and teeth were fragrant. There was also a very special taste to them. ”

“Through the boiling heat from the bottom of the pot, an Lizi looked up at ye Zao. “Da Zao Zao Zao, the wedding date between you and Master Five is coming up soon. Are You Nervous?” ”

The wedding date.

Yes.

“Although the person in front of him was his sweetheart, he was also about to become someone else’s pillow. ”

Song Shiyu’s lowered eyes could not tell what kind of expression he had.

He was thinking.

“If the person who was trapped in the small dark room more than ten years ago had not met her, what kind of situation would he be in now. ”

Was there still song Shiyu in the Human World?

Perhaps.

It couldn’t be.

“If a person did not have light in his heart, how could he survive? ”

“Her beautiful face was faintly discernible. After a moment, ye Zao slowly said, “Fortunately, I’m not particularly nervous.” ”

“”Oh Right, Zao Zao, your wedding date with Master Five is set for the sixth day of February, right?”Zhao Pingting asked. ”

“Yes.”Ye Zouzhuo nodded slightly.

“Zhao Pingting did some calculations. “Then I might not have time to rush back. Zouzhuo, you...”at the end of her sentence, Zhao Pingting’s voice became softer and softer. ”

“Upon hearing this, an lizi continued, “Can you take a leave of absence?” ”

The three of them were best friends. It was not easy to meet each other. An Lizi did not want Zhao Pingting to miss ye Zouzhuo’s wedding.
