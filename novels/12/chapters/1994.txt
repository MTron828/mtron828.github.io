“However, Cen Shaoqing was still a little worried. “Why don’t we wait and come back tomorrow to take a look?” ”

“”No need. It’s fine today.”Ye Zhuo took out the swimming apparatus and continued, “Stretch out your hand.” ”

Cen Shaoqing stretched out his right hand.

Ye Zhuo helped Cen Shaoqing put on the white swimming apparatus.

“That’s enough. Let’s go down.”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly and started unbuttoning.

“His figure was very good. He had only unbuttoned a few buttons, but he could already see the muscle lines hidden in the fabric. ”

“The unique scent of a male’s hormones was bursting. Moreover, the scene was so pleasing to the eye. ”

Ye Zao was stunned. “Why are you taking off your clothes?”

Cen Shaoqing curled his lips slightly. “You Guess.”

Guess...

Guess what?

The blazing sun on the sea burned one’s face. Ye Zao looked at him and his footsteps were a little unsteady. He took a few steps back with a dazed look on his face.

Behind him was the mast that hung the canvas.

Ye Zao’s back was directly pressed against the mast.

“Cen Shaoqing walked over step by step. The sunlight shone from behind him, making it difficult to see his face clearly. However, that pair of exquisite Phoenix eyes could not be ignored. ”

There was an aura of looking down on the world.

“Cen Shaoqing placed both of his hands on the mast. His clothes were half-undone. He leaned slightly and trapped her between him and the mast. He was tall and had long legs. Now That Ye Zhuo was trapped by him, there was nowhere to escape. The man’s Deep Phoenix eyes were locked onto her, the depths of his dark eyes could not be seen. There was an undetectable danger hidden within them. ”

It was like a fierce tiger that had locked onto its prey in the dark.

“Ye Zao gulped. For some reason, she was actually a little nervous. ”

She had seen a ghost.

“In the S galaxy, she had encountered all kinds of danger, but she had never been this nervous before. ”

“”You, what do you want?” ”

“Cen Shaoqing looked at her. “The blue sea and the blue sky, a man and a woman alone, not dressed properly. What do you think I want to Do?” ”

“Usually, ye Zhuo would tease him. Now that he had suddenly become the host, she was not used to it. ”

“Seeing that his face was getting closer and closer, ye Zhuoyu’s face became redder and redder. ”

Her heart was beating faster and faster.

“In the next second, Cen Shaoqing laughed lightly. ”

Ye Zhuo also reacted at this time and raised his leg to kick CEN Shaoqing.

“Hiss!”Cen Shaoqing raised his leg. “You murdered your husband!”

“Serves you right!”Ye Zhuo raised his leg to kick him again.

Cen Shaoqing did not Dodge and just let her kick him.

Ye Zhuo’s kick was not light. “Why didn’t you Dodge!”

“”As long as you’re happy, leader.”Cen Shaoqing’s tone was low. ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “In terms of eloquence, you’re number one. No one would dare to claim that you’re number two.” ”

Cen Shaoqing imitated ye Zhuo’s usual manner. “Keep a low profile. This is all because the leader usually trains you well.”

“”Don’t be so poor.”Ye Zao smiled and said, “Hurry up. The Sun will set soon.” ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly and took off his robe. He jumped into the sea and looked up at her. “Leader.”

Ye Zao happened to be wearing a t-shirt. He was too lazy to change his clothes. He took off his shoes and jumped directly into the sea.

CEN Shaoqing rarely swam. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“When he was 20 years old, he still had a severe deep-sea phobia. However, he had gotten much better in the past two years. ”

“But at this moment, looking at the blue sea, he was still a little nervous. ”

“At this moment, his right hand was held by someone. ”

“When he turned around, he saw a face as clear as a painting. ”

It was inconvenient to talk in the water.

But the tacit understanding between the two had reached the point where one could understand what the other was trying to say with just one look.

Ye Zhuo brought Cen Shaoqing to the trench.

The trench was very deep.

They swam for a long time before they reached the sunken ship.

The two of them looked at each other and swam into the sunken ship.

“Just as ye Zhuo had said, there was nothing like human remains inside the sunken ship. ”

It was as if everyone had disappeared before the sunken ship.

Cen Shaoqing took out his waterproof phone and took a few photos.

They looked inside and out of the ship before they swam out of the sea.

Ye Zhuo looked at Cen Shaoqing. “How is it? Have you found your thoughts?”

“”Not for the time being,”cen Shaoqing continued, “Let’s go back to the yacht and change our clothes before we talk in detail.” ”

“Continent X was located at the southernmost tip of the Earth. It had been under the Sun for a long time, so the difference in temperature between day and night was extremely large. At this time, the sun was gradually setting in the west. Ye Zhuo was also a girl. If he kept doing this, his body would not be able to take it. ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly and boarded the yacht with Cen Shaoqing.

“After returning to the yacht, Ye Zhuo went into the bathroom. After taking a simple shower, he walked to the deck. ”

Cen Shaoqing had already changed his clothes and was lying on the deck chair watching the sunset.
