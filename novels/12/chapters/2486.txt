“Yaoyao!”

“When he saw Chen Siyao in the freezer, old master Chen’s strength seemed to have been sucked away in an instant, and his face turned pale. ”

“Yaoyao...”

Chen Siyao lay in the freezer and didn’t respond.

“The cold mortuary echoed with the cries of the two old men. The staff at the side had experienced countless similar things, and their expressions had long become numb. ”

“”Yaoyao, how could you bear to leave Grandpa Behind!” ”

“”Yaoyao, wake up and see if Grandpa is okay!” ”

“Miss!”The housekeeper lay on the ground and cried bitterly.

“...”

“After crying for a long time, old master Chen walked out of the mortuary and signed the hospital list. ”

“Under normal circumstances, the bodies could not be transported back, but the Chen family had their own plane. ”

“Four hours later, the plane landed at Yun Jing Airport. ”

The Chen family was covered in white.

“Old Master Chen looked at his relatives and friends who had come to pay their respects, and his face lost all luster. ”

Chen Siyao was gone.

Chen You Long was still in the detention center. Where was the Chen family’s Hope? Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The Butler brought a bowl of medicine. “Old Master.”

Old Master Chen looked at the butler and waved his hand.

“The housekeeper sighed. “Old Master, sir is still in the detention center. If you fall, our family will be finished!” ”

Old Master Chen looked into the distance and his heart was filled with sorrow.

“”Old Master, you should at least drink some medicine.”The housekeeper brought the medicine to Old Master Chen again. ”

“Old Master Chen took the medicine and drank a mouthful. However, he could not swallow the rest of the medicine no matter how hard he tried. ”

It was so bitter.

Why was the medicine so bitter? !

“Seeing Old Master Chen like this, the housekeeper’s eyes gradually turned sour. These past few days, he couldn’t remember how many tears he had shed. ”

He couldn’t even believe that Chen Siyao had left just like that.

“”Maosheng,”Old Master Chen looked at the housekeeper. “Tell me... am I really wrong?” ”

“Perhaps, from the beginning, he shouldn’t have agreed to Chen Siyao’s request, nor should he have encouraged Chen Siyao to be serious. ”

“He thought that he wouldn’t be wrong about song Shiyu, but he was wrong. ”

Song Shiyu was a wolf.

A Wolf without humanity!

“The housekeeper wiped away his tears. “Old Master, it was just an accident. Don’t think too much about it.” ”

“The Chen family was already swaying in the wind and rain. If something happened to old master Chen at this time, then the Chen family would really be finished! ”

“”I was wrong.”The corners of grandfather Chen’s mouth curled up into an unknown arc. “I was wrong! Yaoyao, grandfather was wrong! Can you forgive grandfather? Yaoyao...” ”

“At the end of his sentence, grandfather Chen’s face was already covered in tears. ”

The Butler was also crying.

“Chen Youlong, who was in the detention center, also heard this news. His eyes widened and he said in disbelief, “It can’t be! It Can’t be! You must have made a mistake!” ”

“Chen Siyao’s health had always been very good, and she had never heard of anything troubling her. Why would she want to commit suicide! ”

“I want to see my father!”Chen Youlong looked at the staff of the detention center.

“Initially, Chen Youlong wasn’t worried at all. He knew that Old Master Chen definitely had a way to save him. ”

“But now, Chen Youlong was in a Panic! ”

Something had happened to Chen Siyao. Old Master Chen was already old and his health wasn’t good to begin with. could he withstand the repeated blows?

He had to get out immediately!

“No! I want to see Third Master Song!”Chen Youlong changed his words.

“In the current situation, the only person who could save the Chen family was song Shiyu. ”

“Third Master song is someone you can see whenever you want?”

“Hearing this, Chen Youlong was stunned. ”

“Only then did he remember that he had been locked up in the detention center for so many days, and song Shiyu hadn’t even shown up. He hadn’t even seen song Shiyu’s assistant. ”

Abnormal!

This was really too abnormal!

“Chen Youlong sat in his chair, his brows tightly furrowed. ”

Nanhai.

“Song Shiyu sat in front of the 31st floor French window, looking down at everything below. He then asked, “What’s the situation in Yun Jing right now?” ”
