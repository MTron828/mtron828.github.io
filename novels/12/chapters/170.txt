Chapter 171: 087: tearing a mistress apart, divorce! 7

The company leader frowned and looked at Liang Xinyi. “What’s going on?”

Liang Xinyi said with reddened eyes, “Manager, this is a misunderstanding...”

“I have evidence here.”An Lizi handed a photo to the leader, “The man in the photo is my father. I don’t need to say more about this woman. You should know her, right? My father is divorcing my mother because of her! She has caused our family to turn upside down. I’m in my third year of high school this year, the most important year of my life. But now, I’ve been ruined by her! Ruined by this woman!”

Hearing this, the crowd sighed.

“This little girl is too pitiful!”

“A dog and a woman! She’s simply Inhuman!”

“How can our company have such a shameless woman!”

After saying that, an Lizi bowed deeply to the leader, “I came to your company today to disturb your employees. I’m here to apologize to you and everyone! My mother is magnanimous and doesn’t want to argue with a mistress! But as my daughter, I can’t bear to see my mother suffer! I really have no other way! I believe that justice is in the hearts of the people. Your Company will definitely handle this matter well.”

After saying that, an Lizi turned around and left.

The surrounding employees said, “Manager Zhou! A person like Liang Xinyi doesn’t deserve to stay in our company at all!”

“Right! She doesn’t deserve to!”

“Fire her!”

Manager Zhou looked at Liang Xinyi and said, “Go to the finance department and settle this month’s salary. You Don’t have to come next month.”

......

Hearing that, Liang Xinyi felt like the sky was falling.

She had worked here for almost 20 years and had always been conscientious and had never made any mistakes. She was about to retire and receive her retirement salary and pension, but now, the company actually wanted to fire her!

“No Way, manager! You Can’t Fire Me!”

The person who was fired would not have a pension or pension.

Moreover, she was already so old. What could she do after being fired?

Could she find another job?

Even if she did find another job, it would definitely be a dirty and tiring job!

It could not be compared to her current job!

“It’s impossible for our company to hire an employee with bad morals!”After saying this, manager Zhou looked at the security guard beside him. “Send her out!”

Rather than saying that she was sent out.

It was more appropriate to say that she was dragged out.

Liang Xinyi was dragged out.

After being dragged out of the house, Liang Xinyi was both angry and angry. She picked up her phone and called an Dongliang.

An Dongliang rushed over. When he saw Liang Xinyi like this, his heart ached terribly. “Xinyi, don’t worry. I’ll definitely teach that girl a lesson when I Get Back!”

“I’ve lost my job and my reputation. Dongliang, just let me die! I Don’t want to live anymore!”

“If you lose your job, so be it! From now on, I’ll give you 30,000 a month! I’ll support you!”

Hearing this, Liang Xinyi’s eyes lit up.

That’s right.

So what if she lost her job?

In any case, an Dongliang had plenty of money!

However, Liang Xinyi was still crying. The more she cried, the more an Dongliang would hate the mother and daughter.

Liang Xinyi had suffered.

An Dongliang would definitely seek justice for her.

When he returned home, he threw a tantrum!

“Lizi is becoming more and more unruly!”An Dongliang pointed at Xia Xiaoman and said, “How did your mother teach her?”

Xia Xiaoman frowned slightly. “What happened to Lizi?”

An dongliang said angrily, “She went to Xinyi’s company and caused a ruckus, causing her to lose her job! I’ve already said it, I’ve already broken up with her! Why do you have to go against her!”

“I think that Lizi didn’t do anything wrong.”Xia Xiaoman’s voice was a little cold. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

If it wasn’t for the sake of an Dongliang’s face, Xia Xiaoman would have done it long ago.

An Dongliang pointed at Xia Xiaoman and said, “Were you the one who instructed Lizi to do this? I told you, Lizi is just a child, how could she be so calculative! Xia Xiaoman! You’ve really disappointed me!”

Xia Xiaoman looked at an dongliang and said, “Do you not want to break up with that mistress?”

“I have nothing to do with her now! It’s you two who have disappointed me!”

“Nothing to do with her now, right? Alright then!”Xia Xiaoman nodded. “Call her out now. The three of us stand together and explain this matter clearly!”

“What do you want to Do?”An Dongliang asked cautiously.

“Nothing.”Xia Xiaoman continued, “I just want to let her know that there is a price to pay for being a mistress!”

“No!”An dongliang frowned.
