Chapter 985: 223: Cao Wei revealed the truth about the XI family. He must be lying to you! 2

Translator: 549690339

Half a month had just turned three years old when she was lost.

Aunt Lang’s eyes welled up. The tears that had already stopped started to burst again.

She could not imagine how much pain and suffering half a month had gone through that year.

This was all her fault.

It was all her fault.

“If she had not lost half a month, half a month would not have gone through so much.”

“Xi Weiyue took out a tissue to wipe away aunt Lang’s tears, “Aunt, don’t cry. It’s a happy thing to be able to find half a month’s sister. Let the past be the past. My father took half a month’s sister to the Doctor. The Doctor said that as long as she recuperates well in the future, half a month’s sister will still have a chance to recover.””

“Xi Weiyue paused. “Aunt, do you dislike the current Sister Half Moon?””

“”No! No!”Aunt Lang sobbed. “No matter what she turns into, she’s still my daughter...”no mother would dislike their own daughter.”

Xi Weiyue’s eyes flashed with sarcasm.

Not Despise?

This ye Langhua was really ungrateful.

“She had taken care of ye Langhua for so many years, yet she had never seen ye Langhua say anything nice about her. Now that her biological daughter had turned into a fool, she did not dislike it.”

It was really disgusting!

Could it be that XI weiyue could not be compared to a fool?

It was said that the hearts of people changed.

“She was closer to ye Langhua than her biological mother. Even after 20 years, she still could not get ye Langhua’s sincerity.”

The expression in Xi Weiyue’s eyes changed.

An ingrate like ye Langhua deserved to die! She deserved to die!

Because she did not deserve to have family!

“Soon, the two of them walked into the living room.”

“When he saw Aunty Lang, Xi Muwen immediately stood up from the sofa. “Langhua, you’re back.””

“Aunty Lang’s gaze swept across the living room, but she did not see a third person. “Where’s Little Half Moon? Where’s My Little Half Moon? Are you guys lying to me?””

“”No, we’re not lying to you,”xi muwen continued, “Yang Jiao took the children to change their clothes. They’ll be out soon.””

“Really?”Aunt Lang frowned.

“XI weiyue smiled and said, “Aunt, look at what you’re saying. would my father lie to you about something like this?””

“At that moment, Yang Jiao came down from upstairs with a middle-aged woman. “Sister, this is little half moon.””

“Aunt Lang turned to look at the woman standing beside Yang Jiao. Her emotions burst at this moment and she couldn’t care about anything else. She cried out and ran over to hug the woman. “Little Half Moon, my little half moon, mother has finally found you...””

Yang Jiao and Xi Muwen looked at each other and saw the smug look in each other’s eyes.

This ye Langhua was really stupid.

“The woman was so scared that her whole body was trembling. She quickly broke free from Aunt Lang’s embrace and hid behind Yang Jiao. Her eyes were filled with fear. “Don’t hit me, don’t Hit Me...””

Aunt Lang was stunned.

“Even though XI Weiyue had told her in advance that Little Half Moon was in a trance, she did not expect little half moon to become like this.”

What kind of despair did she go through to turn out like this?

Aunt Lang covered her mouth as her whole body trembled. “Little Half Moon...”

Was this really her little half moon?

“Yang Jiao looked up at Aunt Lang. “Sister, Little Half Moon has been like this ever since she was found. Mu Wen has already taken her to the hospital for a look. The Doctor said that this has something to do with her experience. If she takes good care of herself in the future, she will return to normal.”” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“After saying that, Yang Jiao turned back to look at the woman and continued, “Little Half Moon, is this your mother? Good Child, don’t be afraid. She has been looking for you for many years. She will not hurt you...””

“Aunt Lang stood there and waved at the woman. She said in a hoarse voice, “Little Half Moon, come here. Come to your mother.””

The woman lowered her head and did not dare to look at Aunt Lang.

“Little Half Moon?”Aunt Lang called out again.

“However, not only did little half moon not respond to her, she even took a few steps back.”

She was afraid.

Afraid.

“Looking at Little Half Moon, Aunty Lang covered her mouth, trying her best not to make a sound.”

“Yang Jiao walked over to the woman and held her hand, bringing her to Aunty Lang’s side, she said softly, “Sister, you just came back. It’s normal for Little Half Moon to be afraid of you. You just need to interact with her more. We have to give the child a process of adaptation.””

“Xi Muwen looked up at Aunt Lang. “Yang Jiao is right. You have to give the child a process of adaptation. Let’s not talk about you. Even I, the father, was scared at the beginning. Half a month, be good. Come to Daddy.””
