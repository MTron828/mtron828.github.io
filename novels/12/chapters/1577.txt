Little Tian Shun looked at the third aunt.

“Old Mrs. Cen smiled and said, “This child still needs you to speak! Don’t make things difficult for the child, let him eat quickly!” ”

“The third aunt then said, “Hurry up and thank the ancestor.” ”

“Little Tian Shun looked up at Old Mrs. Cen. “Thank, thank the ancestor.” ”

“Good child.”Old Madam Cen smiled and patted Little Tianshun’s head.

“Little Tianshun first picked up a small bear biscuit and ate it slowly. After finishing it, he picked up a piece of chocolate. ”

“It was a little bitter. As a child who had never eaten chocolate before, the taste was not very good. However, Little Tianshun still swallowed the chocolate. ”

“After eating the chocolate, Little Tianshun held the Milk Cup and drank a mouthful of milk. ”

“The taste of fresh milk was extremely mellow. Due to the addition of honey, it was still somewhat sweet. So this was the taste of milk. Xiao Tianshun happily narrowed his eyes and temporarily forgot about the awkwardness and uneasiness. ”

“Looking at Xiao Tianshun, Old Lady Cen’s heart ached. ”

This child really suffered.

“At such a young age, he had no father and no mother. ”

“After drinking a glass of fresh milk, Xiao Tianshun sat there obediently and did not move. ”

“Although he was only five years old, the children of poor families were in charge. When he came here, the ancestor had instructed him to be a good child with rules. ”

“Soon, Xiao Tianshun’s gaze was attracted by the figure of Peggy the pig on the television. A smile bloomed on his face. ”

“As a Chinese medicine practitioner, Ye Zhuo was keenly aware that there was something wrong with Xiao Tianshun. He held Xiao Tianshun’s hand and turned to look at the third aunt. “Third grandmother, does Xiao Tianshun have a runny nose whenever he gets cold?” ”

“The third aunt thought that ye Zhuo felt that the child was too dirty, so she quickly walked over to wipe the child’s nose. As she wiped, she said, “Yes, this child has been like this since he was young. I’ve also taken him to the village’s Hospital to have a look, but it’s just not good!” ”

“Ye Zao continued, “I think Little Tian Shun’s symptoms are a little like seasonal rhinitis. Although rhinitis is not a big problem, we still have to treat it as soon as possible. Otherwise, if this continues, the small problem will become a big problem!” ”

“Hearing this, Old Madam Cen quickly nodded and echoed, “Third aunt, Zao Zao is a doctor. You have to listen to her words!” ”

“Hearing this, the third aunt immediately said, “Then what should we do? Do you want to take the medicine or do the surgery?” ”

“”Wait a moment, I’ll write a prescription for you. You just have to follow the prescription and give Little Tian the medicine.” ”

Cen Shaoqing had the habit of bringing a pen with him. He immediately handed a pen to Ye Zhuozhuo.

Ye Zhuozhuo took the pen and wrote the prescription on the paper.

“The housekeeper took the prescription and said to old Mrs. Cen, “Old Mrs. Cen, I’ll go and get the medicine now.” ”

“Go and come back quickly.”Old Mrs. Cen nodded.

“The third aunt immediately stood up. “Haifeng’s mother, Shaoqing’s wife, how, how can I thank you!” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen patted the third aunt’s hand. “We’re all on the same side, there’s no need to thank me.” ”

“At this moment, the housekeeper came in with a snakeskin bag. “Third old Mrs. Cen, you brought this here, right?” ”

“Third aunt stood up a little awkwardly. “Yes, I brought it here! There are some home-grown vegetables inside...”third aunt couldn’t continue, her face was boiling hot, and she felt that the things she brought were not presentable. ” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Old Mrs. Cen smiled as she walked to the housekeeper’s side and took the snakeskin bag, “The home-grown vegetables are good. I’d better take this bite! Right now, all the vegetables in the city have been wrapped up by pesticides. Vegetables don’t have the smell of vegetables, and radishes don’t have the smell of radishes. Organic vegetables like ours, grown at home, can not be bought even if you have money!” ”

“As she said this, old Mrs. Cen opened the snakeskin bag and said, “Third aunt, you even brought chicken for our family!”The chicken had been cleaned. ”

“Hearing Old Mrs. Cen’s words, the third aunt felt much less uneasy. She walked over and said, “Well, as long as you don’t mind it!” ”

“”We are more than happy! How Can We Mind It!”Old Mrs. Cen said with a smile, “This kind of chicken is called walking chicken in the city. The stew is delicious. You Can’t buy it even if you have money.” ”

“Ye Zao walked over with a smile, “Then I will drink two more bowls of soup tonight! Ah, there are potatoes too! I like spicy and sour shredded potatoes the most!” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen said with a smile, “Ask the kitchen to burn all these dishes tonight.” ”

Third aunt looked at Old Mrs. Cen and then looked at Ye Zao. Her eyes were a little red. It would be a lie to say that she was not touched.

“Ever since their son and daughter-in-law and grandson’s daughter-in-law had been in trouble one after another, the people who were on good terms with their family in the past had all changed their faces. They were afraid that their great-grandfather and grandson would touch them. This time, when they came to the Cen family.., the third aunt was also very anxious. Who would have thought that the CEN family was still so kind and humane! ”
