Translator: 549690339

“In Bai Jiayu’s opinion, although song Shiyu did not see through the mortal world, it was no different from seeing through the mortal world. ”

He had no heart and would not fall in love with anyone.

He was also eccentric and had a temper disorder.

“Although song Shiyu had never said that he would not marry and have children, it could be seen that he would not do such a thing. ”

It seemed that there was no such thing as ‘Desire’in him.

“No matter how crazy the people around him played, he could still remain calm. ”

“Sometimes, Bai Jiayu even doubted whether song Shiyu could do it. ”

“Hearing this, Tian zihao frowned and said, “You’re not third brother. How do you know that third brother isn’t the kind of person who would marry and have children just to carry on the family line?” ”

“You don’t believe me?”Bai Jiayu asked.

“”I don’t believe you,”Tian Zihao said. ”

“He was born as a human being. As long as there were conditions, it was impossible for him to not have physical needs. It was impossible for him not to marry and have children unless he wanted to watch his family clan walk towards extinction. ”

“Bai Jiayu continued, “If you don’t believe me, Let’s Make a bet?” ”

“”Okay, let’s make a bet.”Tian zihao continued, “What’s the bet?” ”

“”A million,”Bai Jiayu said. ”

“”Okay, no problem.”Tian zihao nodded. ”

“To these young masters, a million was just a small amount of money. ”

“Tian zihao continued, “Jiayu, when you were in junior high school, did you have a crush on the class Belle?” ”

“Bai Jiayu said, “I had a crush on a female classmate in our class, but she wasn’t the class Belle.” ”

“What happened after that?”Tian Zihao asked curiously.

“According to Bai Jiayu’s personality, he couldn’t keep his hands off her. ”

“Under normal circumstances, as long as Bai Jiayu took a fancy to her, there was nothing he couldn’t get. ”

“Bai Jiayu said, “After that, she transferred to another school.” ”

“”After that, there was no after that?”Tian Zihao asked with his eyes wide open. ”

“Bai Jiayu was a little speechless and said, “What else do you want after that?”In fact, there was after that. After graduation, he would occasionally dream about this female student in the middle of the night, hence, he asked someone to find out the whereabouts of this female classmate, but the result was that the female classmate had already gotten married and had children. ”

“From then on, Bai Jiayu never mentioned this female classmate again and kept this beauty in his heart. ”

“Tian zihao continued, “When I was in junior high school, I also had a crush on a female classmate in my class. You said that we all had a crush on someone, but it’s impossible that third brother doesn’t have one! I’m really curious what the person third brother has a crush on looks like!” ”

Very curious!

“Bai Jiayu took a puff of his cigarette. “Don’t be curious. Third Brother is different from US ordinary people. He won’t like anyone, and he won’t have a crush on anyone.” ”

A Crush?

It didn’t exist!

“If song Shiyu liked someone, he could just snatch it away! ”

“”You’re not a worm in third brother’s stomach!”Tian zihao continued, “Do you still remember Fifth Master Cen? Back then, fifth CEN had also said that he would never marry, and that he would eat vegetarian and pray to Buddha. He had caused a bigger commotion than third brother, and in the end, he still ended up with a beauty in his arms ”

This was called performing for everyone and slapping himself in the face.

“Bai Jiayu said, “Third brother’s situation is different from his.” ”

“At this moment, Bai Jiayu glanced over and saw a familiar figure. He immediately threw away the cigarette butt and stood up straight. “Quick, throw away the cigarette. Third Brother Is Here!” ”

Tian Zihao didn’t react for a moment. “Why are you throwing the cigarette away?”

“Bai Jiayu snatched the cigarette from Tian Zihao’s hand and threw it away. Then, he said, “Third brother has been hating other people smoking recently.” ”

“Doesn’t he smoke himself?”Tian Zihao said.

“He quit a long time ago.”

“Quit?”Tian Zihao widened his eyes in disbelief.

Bai Jiayu took the opportunity to stuff another piece of gum into Tian Zihao’s mouth. “Third brother has been in a bad mood recently. Watch what you say.”

“Got it.”Tian zihao nodded. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Seeing that song Shiyu was getting closer and closer, Bai Jiayu immediately went up to him. “Third brother.” ”

Song Shiyu nodded slightly.

Tian Zihao also walked over. “Third brother.”

“Song Shiyu continued, “Is there anything else?” ”

“No.”The two of them shook their heads.

“Song Shiyu said, “If there’s nothing else, go back.” ”

“Okay.”Tian Zihao immediately opened the car door.

Bai Jiayu sat in the front driving while Tian Zihao sat in the passenger seat while song Shiyu sat alone in the back seat.

This year’s pop music was playing in the car.

Song Shiyu frowned slightly. “Change the song.”

“Bai Jiayu was stunned. “Third brother, what did you say?” ”

Tian Zihao was also slightly stunned.

“Song Shiyu immediately said, “I said change the song.” ”

“”Oh, okay.”Tian Zihao immediately clicked to switch the music. ”
