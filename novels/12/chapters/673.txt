“Ye Zao was not even willing to forgive her, so how could he be willing to treat her? ”

Old Lady Lin shook her head. “It’s fine. Grandma is really fine. There’s no need for Zao to take a look.”

Feng Qianxian was a little worried. “Are you really fine? Why Don’t you ask Sister Ye Zao to take a look?”

Ye Zao could come out and treat Old Lady Lin?

“Actually, Feng Qianqian’s heart was as clear as a mirror! ”

She had said it on purpose to draw hatred for ye Zhuo.

“If it weren’t for Ye Zhuo, she and her mother would never have gotten to this point. ”

This was all thanks to ye Zhuo!

Wait!

She would definitely let ye Zhuo have a taste of this!

She would make ye Zhuo die a horrible death!

Old Lady Lin Sighed in her heart. It would be great if ye Zhuo could be as sensible as Feng Qianqian. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

She slapped Feng Xianxian and even scolded Feng Xianxian.

“But not only was Feng Xianxian not angry, she even used suicide to ask for her forgiveness. ”

What About Ye Zao?

She was hospitalized for two days and ye Zao did not even show his face.

Although she was also at fault in this matter.

But it was not entirely her fault.

“No matter what, she was ye Zao’s grandmother. ”

Ye Zao’s actions were simply too heartless!

“Feng Qianqian continued, “Grandmother, did sister ye Zao misunderstand you because of my mother’s matter? It doesn’t matter, I can go and explain it to her! I can go and beg for her forgiveness! In any case, I’ve already died once. As long as I can be her sister and forgive me, I’m willing to do anything!” ”

“Seeing Feng Qianqian like this, Old Madam Lin’s eyes turned even redder, her heart aching. “No, no, there’s really nothing wrong with grandmother’s body. You Don’t have to beg her!” ”

“If ye Zhuo was sensible, there was no need for Feng Xianxian to take the initiative to beg him. ”

She would come to the hospital herself.

“Are you really alright?”Feng Xianxian looked at Old Madam Lin with uncertainty.

Old Madam Lin nodded. “I’m really alright!”

Feng Xianxian sniffed. “It’s good that you’re alright.”

“Three days later, Old Madam Lin was discharged from the hospital. ”

Lin Qingxuan came to the hospital to pick her up.

Old Lady Lin looked at Lin Qingxuan. “Why didn’t Jin city’s family come?”

Lin Qingxuan rubbed his nose. “Jin city’s pretty busy.”

Busy?

Were they really that busy?

They were probably unwilling to forgive her!

“However, Old Lady Lin did not directly point it out. She continued, “Wait a little longer.” ”

“Who are you waiting for?”Lin Qingxuan turned to look at Old Madam Lin.

“I’m waiting for Xianxian. She will be discharged today.”

Feng Xianxian?

“Lin Qingxuan’s expression changed instantly, “Mother! Feng Qianhua has caused you and the entire Jin City family to be in this state. Do you still want to treat Feng Xianxian as your granddaughter? How will the entire Jin City family view you if you do this? Jin city was in a car accident because of Feng Qianhua. Searing was replaced because of Feng Qianhua! She even put poison in your health-preserving soup! Is this kind of person still worthy of your forgiveness?” ”

“Old Madam Lin’s expression was also very unsightly, “Qingxuan! To think that you are a person who has read books! Don’t you know that possessing wealth is a sin, and a child is innocent? These things were all done by Feng Qianhua, what has it got to do with Xianxian? Besides, Xianxian has already died once, what do you want her to do? Are you going to watch her die again? Are you that ruthless?” ”

Lin Qingxuan frowned. “Feng Xianxian is already nineteen this year. Are you so sure that she doesn’t know anything about what Feng Qianhua did?”

“Anyway, Lin Qingxuan didn’t believe it. ”

“Old Lady Lin only knew that Feng Xianxian was like her, a pitiful person who couldn’t be forgiven. She wouldn’t listen to anything else.., “Qingxuan, I believe that Xianxian is not that kind of child! She is innocent! She was deceived by Feng Qianhua just like me!” ”

Lin Qingxuan took a deep breath and tried his best to calm himself down.

“At this moment, Feng Xianxian walked over from the other side. Her voice was very low and her face was full of guilt, “Fourth uncle Lin, I know that nothing I say now will make things better. But I still want to say that I was also kept in the dark by my mother. I really don’t know... ... Grandma has always doted on me since I was young. If I knew about this, I definitely wouldn’t have let my mother do this!” ”

“At the end of her sentence, Feng Xianxian bowed deeply to Lin Qingxuan. Then, she turned to look at Old Lady Lin. “Grandma, I’m going to school first. I’ll visit you another day.” ”

“Old Lady Lin held Feng Xianxian’s hand. “Xianxian, let your fourth uncle send you off.” ”

Feng Xianxian shook her head. “No need.”
