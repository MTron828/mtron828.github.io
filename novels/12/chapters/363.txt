“Feng Qianhua turned her head to look out of the car window. “I’m already tired of fawning over those people from the Lin family every day! It’s just a servant, Mom, isn’t this a little too much to make a fuss over?” ”

“Feng Qianhua looked at Feng Qianhua and wanted to say something, but she swallowed her words and said, “Next time, when you see Grandma Zhang, be more polite!” ”

“”Got it,”Feng Qianxian replied casually. ”

“After Feng Qianhua returned to the Feng family, she immediately told Old Mrs. Lin about inviting old Mrs. Feng to the Lin family as a guest. ”

“Hearing this, old Mrs. Feng looked at Feng Qianhua and said, “Qianhua, I don’t have any other wishes now. My only wish is that you can marry into the Lin family as soon as possible and truly become a member of the Lin family.” ” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“After saying this, old madam Feng continued, “The Lin family invited me over this time. Is it to discuss your marriage with Jin City?” ”

Nineteen years.

Feng Qianhua had been waiting from the beginning until now.

But there was still no movement from the Lin family.

Old Madam Feng was worried that Feng Qianhua would come up empty-handed.

“A hint of sadness flashed across Feng Qianhua’s eyes. It lasted for a moment before disappearing. “Mother, when it comes to matters of the heart, it should be done naturally. You Can’t rush it. Don’t worry, what belongs to me will not grow wings and fly away.” ”

Lin Jin city belonged to her.

The position of the matriarch of the Lin family also belonged to her!

She would not let anyone take away what belonged to her!

“Ye Shu could not defeat her 19 years ago, but 19 years later, she still had to step on her feet. ”

“Old madam Feng continued, “Qianhua, if the Lin family doesn’t give you a reply, you have to make two plans. Even if you don’t think about yourself, you should think about the Feng family. All these years, the food that you and your mother have been eating has belonged to your brother and sister-in-law!” ”

The last sentence was a little harsh.

“If Feng Qianhua was not still useful, a daughter who had already married off would not have been raised by her mother’s family for so long! ”

“But it had been so many years, and the Lin family had not made any concrete actions. How could old madam Feng not be worried? ”

“”I know, Mom.”Feng Qianhua nodded. “Don’t worry, I’m not the kind of person who is ungrateful.” ”

Old Mrs. Feng patted Feng Qianhua’s hand. “I know you’re a good child.”

On the other side.

The Lin family.

“Old Mrs. Lin called Lin Ze into the bedroom, ready to have a good talk with him. ”

“”Ah Ze, Grandma is getting old. No one knows which comes first, tomorrow or by accident.”Old Mrs. Lin held Lin Ze’s hand, she said very emotionally, “The only person Grandma Can Trust right now is your Aunt Feng. Grandma doesn’t want you and your son to be alone in this world. I believe that your Aunt Feng will definitely bring life and warmth to this family.” ”

Feng Qianhua was a rare and good woman. Old Mrs. Lin was very assured that the Lin family would be handed over to her.

“Lin Ze looked at Old Mrs. Lin like this and his attitude was very firm. “Grandma, I’ll say it again. If you insist on my father remarrying, anyone is fine, except for Aunt Feng.” ”

“Why?”Old Mrs. Lin frowned.

“Lin Ze said, “I don’t like her.” ”

“Old Mrs. Lin’s eyes were a little red, “Ah Ze, you can’t be heartless. Your Auntie Feng has helped our family a lot over the years. Just take it as Grandma begging you, okay? It’s not easy for your Auntie Feng to carry Xianxian all these years. Don’t you want a sister?” ”

“”I don’t like a sister,”Lin ze rejected directly. ”

Old Mrs. Lin Sighed. “Can’t Grandma Beg You Personally?”

Lin Ze remained silent.

Not answering was the best answer.

“Seeing Lin ze like this, Old Mrs. Lin tried her best to suppress the anger in her heart. She raised her hand and said tiredly, “You can go out.” ”

“Then I’ll go back to my room first.”Lin Ze turned around and walked out of the door.

Old Mrs. Lin looked at Lin Ze’s back and sighed deeply.

She had not taught her child well.

She had let Feng Qianhua down.

“Soon, it was the next day. ”

Old Mrs. Feng brought a generous gift and came to the Lin family with Feng Qianhua and her daughter.

“Old Mrs. Lin warmly received them. “Elder sister, it’s been a long time.” ”

“”It has been a long time.”Old Mrs. Feng smiled and said, “How have you been recently?” ”

“Old Mrs. Lin welcomed old Mrs. Feng into the house. “Thanks to Qianhua’s health soup every day, my body is much better than before.” ”

It was not old Mrs. Feng’s first visit to the Lin family.

“But every time she came to the Lin family, she was surprised. ”

“Compared to the Lin family’s big manor, the Feng family’s small villa could not even compare to a pigeon cage. ”
