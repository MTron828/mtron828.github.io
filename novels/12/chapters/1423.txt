Translator: 549690339

Xie wanqiu raised her eyelids. “Why didn’t my old man come himself?” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“The young man politely said, “Hello, Madam Xie. My name is Wu Zhilong. I’m Mr. Zhou Zuolong’s lawyer. This is the divorce agreement he asked me to bring for you.” ”

Divorce Agreement!

“Xie Wanqiu was stunned. She thought that Zhou Zuolong had sent someone to apologize to her and bring her back. She did not expect that the person who came was actually a lawyer! ... Moreover, he even brought the divorce agreement! ”

What was this?

“I won’t Sign It!”Xie wanqiu turned her head. “I will never sign it even if I Die!”

“Wu Zhilong adjusted his glasses, “Madam Xie, you are considered to have cheated on your wife. Even if you are not willing to sign the divorce agreement, as long as Mr. Zhou appeals to the court, the judge will give you a divorce! “To tell you the truth, Mr. Zhou is already preparing to appeal.” ”

“”So, my grandfather really wants to divorce my grandmother?”Zheng Wanyin asked with a pale face. ”

“”Yes.”Wu Zhilong nodded. “So, Ms. Xie, you’d better hurry up and sign it. Don’t waste everyone’s time.” ”

“”I didn’t have an affair, and I didn’t do anything to let Zhou Zuolong down. Those photos are all synthetic and have nothing to do with me!”Xie wanqiu said. ”

Wu Zhilong took out his phone and played a video. “So these are also made up?”

“Looking at the scenes in the video, Xie Wanqiu wished she could take out her phone and smash it! ”

“At this moment, Zheng Wanyin thought of the doll. She covered her mouth and said, “It, it, it turns out that the doll is a surveillance device!” ”

No Wonder Zhou Zuolong didn’t even want her anymore!

It turned out that Zhou Zuolong knew about the things that happened in the ward.

“When she thought of this, Zheng Wanyin’s blood flowed backwards. ”

What stupid things had she done!

She actually called Wu Youyu’s grandfather in front of Zhou Zuolong!

“Xie wanqiu had completely given up. She looked up at Wu Zhilong and said, “Even if it’s a divorce, Zhou Zuolong will still get half of the Zhou family’s assets. He can forget about sending me away just like that!” ”

She had followed Zhou Zuolong for so many years. She couldn’t just leave like that.

“”You’re the one who’s at fault. You still want the family’s assets, not to mention that the current Mr. Zhou is penniless. Not only is he penniless, but he’s also carrying a loan of over 300,000 yuan! “According to the marriage law, this is a joint loan between you and your wife. You have to repay 150,000 of the loan!” ”

“How can Zhou Zuolong be penniless? You’re Coaxing a child!”Xie wanqiu said.

“Wu Zhilong took a step forward, “It seems that you still don’t know that after old Mr. Zhou found out about your marital infidelity, he transferred all of his assets to Little Mr. Zhou. So, old Mr. Zhou is penniless now!”With that said, wu Zhilong handed Xie wanqiu a document. “This is the property certificate issued by the Notary Office.” ”

Xie wanqiu took the document.

As expected.

“Just as Wu Zhilong had said, Zhou Zuolong was now a penniless wretch. ”

“Wu Zhilong continued, “Of course, you can also choose not to sign the divorce agreement. “But I have to remind you that as long as Mr. Zhou files an appeal, your marriage will automatically be dissolved after three months. Of course, if Mr. Zhou continues to borrow money within these three months, you will have to repay half of this loan! “Don’t even think about borrowing money. You are now the party at fault. No matter how much money you borrow, the court will not judge Mr. Zhou to help you repay it.” ”

Whoosh!

Xie wanqiu’s face turned pale.

Ruthless!

Zhou Zuolong was really too ruthless.

“It was said that a husband and wife should have a hundred days of grace. She and Zhou Zuolong had been husband and wife for more than thirty years, but they actually ended up like this! ”

It was pathetic and laughable.

“Seeing Xie wanqiu like this, Wu Zhilong continued, “Madam Xie, I advise you to quit while you’re ahead. Otherwise, the gains will not make up for the losses!” ”

“Sign! I’ll sign!”Xie wanqiu bit her lips tightly.

“She had earned enough money from the Zhou family over the years. Even if they divorced now, she would not lose out! ”

Wu Zhilong handed the pen to Xie Wanqiu.

“Seeing Xie wanqiu sign the divorce agreement, Zheng Wanyin knelt down in tears. “No, no...” ”

“With this signature, she had nothing to do with Zhou Zuolong. ”

Xie Rongle’s face turned pale.

“After signing, Wu Zhilong put away the divorce agreement and walked out. ”

“Xie wanqiu looked at Zheng Wanyin. “Yinyin, don’t cry. Call your grandfather and ask him to bring us home.” ”

“Grandfather?”Zheng Wanyin froze.
