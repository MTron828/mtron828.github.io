“”That’s good.”Man Jiangshan nodded. “Remember, no matter what, you have to let ye Zhuo acknowledge you.” ”

“Don’t worry.”

The next day.

An explosive piece of news spread throughout the entire S galaxy!

The Manxing Kingdom’s long-lost princess was actually Miss Ye.

“As soon as this piece of news appeared, the number of topics soared to 200 million. ”

[ oh my God! Miss Ye is actually the full moon princess of Manxing Country! ]

[ no wonder miss ye is so amazing. It turns out that she has outstanding genes in her bones. ]

[ I was wondering why Miss Ye’s shadow was in Princess Manxing’s eyes. So Miss Ye is actually Princess Manxing’s elder sister. ]

[ having such a good elder sister is really enviable. ]

“[ Wu Wu Wu Wu, Congratulations to Mr. and Mrs. Man for finally finding your biological daughter after searching for so many years. ] ”

“[ yes, Congratulations! ] ”

[ Miss Ye’s journey was really not easy. It was not easy to find her biological parents. I wish Miss Ye a safe and happy life for the rest of her life! ]

[ ... ]

“As long as one opened the international star network, the topic would always be related to miss ye and Manxing. ”

“The Manxing Nation sat in front of his desk and slowly browsed through the voices on the Internet, his lips curling up slightly. ”

This time.

Ye Zao was really in a difficult situation.

“Facing ye Zao, there were only two choices. ”

The first was to acknowledge his parents.

The second was to resolutely refuse to acknowledge them.

“If ye Zao chose to acknowledge the Manjiangshan and Zhao Dan couple, it would naturally be a good thing for everyone, allowing the people of the s galaxy to see the desired result. ”

But if ye Zao refused...

Ye Zao’s entire life would be destroyed!

“After all, man Jiangshan and Zhao Dan created the image of good parents in front of the public. ”

“Over the years, man Xing country had never stopped looking for news about the full moon princess. ”

“If ye Zao did not acknowledge man Jiangshan and Zhao Dan, then she was an unfilial daughter. ”

“She had an unrighteous outlook and did not have filial piety in her heart. No matter how capable she was, no matter how powerful she was, she would still be despised by the people. ”

“Although man Xing had never interacted with ye Zao before, they were still sisters from the same mother. Based on Ye Zao’s style of doing things, it could be seen that ye Zao was not the kind of person who would give in easily. ”

“If she had acknowledged her entire family, she would not have waited until now. ”

“Although ye Zao had made a name for himself at the family recognition banquet, what awaited her was a different outcome. ”

“No matter what ye Zao chose, whether he wanted to admit it or not, it was beneficial to Manxing. ”

Admit it.

“From now on, she would be ye Zao’s biological sister and Dongli would be her brother-in-law. ”

She would not admit it.

“Ye Zao fell from the altar, and she would return to everyone’s sight. ”

She did not have to do anything. She just had to wait for ye Zao to make a choice.

“Manwen also quickly learned of this news. He angrily found Manjiangshan and Zhao Dan, “I don’t care! In any case, I won’t acknowledge ye Zao! I only have one sister in my life! She is man Xing! I Won’t acknowledge anyone other than man Xing!” ”

Man Jiangshan pointed at man Wen. “Go Back! Don’t meddle in the affairs of Adults!”

“In Man Jiangshan’s eyes, Man Wen would always be an insensible child. He couldn’t even compare to man Xing’s hair. ”

“Fortunately, they still had man Xing. ”

“Otherwise, man Xing nation would be destroyed by man Wen sooner or later. ”

“Mom!”Man Wen looked at Zhao Dan.

“Zhao Dan said, “Listen to your father. Go back quickly! Don’t cause trouble here!” ” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Man Wen picked up a vase and threw it on the ground. “I just don’t recognize ye Zao! She doesn’t have the right to be my sister!”

Man Jiangshan raised his hand and gave man Wen a slap on the face.

Slap!

“This slap frightened Zhao Dan. By the time she reacted, blood had already seeped out from the corner of Man Wen’s mouth. ”

“”Wen ‘er, are you alright?”Zhao Dan immediately looked at man Wen and said, “Why did you hit the child! He did it for Xing ‘ER’s Good!” ”

“A piece of SH * t that can’t be helped!”Man Jiangshan ignored Zhao Dan and looked at man Wen angrily. “Get lost! Get Lost Right Now!”

Man Wen’s face was full of tears as he ran away aggrievedly.

Zhao Dan subconsciously chased after him. “Wen ‘er!”

“Stop right there!”Man Jiangshan shouted angrily. “A loving mother is a useless son. Look at how much you’ve spoiled him!”

Zhao Dan stopped and looked up at man Jiangshan. “Isn’t Wen ‘er doing this to protect Xing ‘er? How can you hit the child directly!”

“”You only know how to Pamper Him!”Man Jiangshan paused, then, he said, “Don’t worry, he will be fine. Pay more attention to the situation on the STAR network and remember to interact with them on the Star Network.”The most important thing for Zhao Dan now was to create a motherly image. ”

“Got it.”Zhao Dan nodded.

The situation on the star network was getting worse and worse. Everyone was waiting for Ye Zhuo to introduce himself to man Jiangshan and his wife.

Zhao Dan and Man Jiangshan were also preparing to head to the alliance country personally to bring ye Zhuo back.

“At this moment, Ye Zhuo also released a video statement. ”

“”I think the President and Madam of man Xing country have mistaken me for someone else. I’ve already found my biological parents not too long ago.”As soon as he finished speaking, ye Zhuo pulled a middle-aged couple to appear on camera, “This is my father, Lin Jincheng. This is my mother, Ye Shu. This is my brother, Lin Ze.” ”

“After this statement was released, Zhao Dan also released a video statement, “Yue’er, Mom knows that you’ve been blaming Mom and dad until now. Why did you lose you. “But mom and dad really didn’t do it on purpose. After you lost you back then, your dad and I couldn’t sleep all day and all night... “All these years, we have never given up on looking for you ! Poor parents in this world. In this world, there are no parents who don’t love their children. All children are their parents’hearts. Do you know how much pain your dad and I feel when you do this ? Apart from saying sorry, I don’t know how to say it. Yue Er, can you forgive Mom and Dad ? We really didn’t do it on purpose ! As long as you can forgive us, we can do anything. Yue Er, mom has knelt down for you!” ”

“In the video, Zhao Dan directly knelt on the ground. ”

It was also this kneeling that ignited the anger in the hearts of the netizens.

“They felt that ye Zhuo was not a good daughter. After all, it was true that the entire Xing nation had been searching for their daughter all these years, and it was also true that they had accidentally lost their daughter. ”

“They did not deliberately want to throw ye Zhuo away. Now that they had found ye Zhuo, everyone should be happy and have a family reunion. However, Ye Zhuo was unwilling to forgive them and even found a pair of fake parents to act. ”

A person did not even have the most basic filial piety. How could he have the right to be in that position?

“”This time, Miss ye is really too much! Mrs. Man has already knelt down for her. What else does she want?” ”

“”I truly feel that Mr. and Mrs. Man did not have it easy. Unfortunately, they did not meet a good daughter.” ”
