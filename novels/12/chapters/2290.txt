“Hearing this, Lin Ze was stunned. His heart was beating very fast. Thump, thump, thump... ”

Should he tell Bai Jingshu right now that the person in his heart was her?

“At this moment, there seemed to be two little people fighting in Lin Ze’s heart. ”

One said tell her!

The other said no.

Lin Ze did not speak for a long time. Bai Jingshu was a little nervous. She turned her head. “Do I know her?”

“Yes.”Lin Ze nodded.

Bai Jingshu didn’t know many people who knew Lin Ze.

“Could it be...”Bai Jingshu hesitated. “It’s...”Shi Qingcheng?

“But Shi Qingcheng was ye Han’s girlfriend now. If she said Shi Qingcheng’s name directly, would Lin Ze be embarrassed? ”

“Bai Jingshu changed the way she said it and continued, “Is the name of the person you like Three Words?” ”

“Yes.”Lin Ze nodded.

“Is she very beautiful?”Bai Jingshu continued to ask.

“She’s very beautiful.”Lin Ze nodded.

Bai Jingshu knew someone who was also very beautiful. It seemed that there was no one else other than Shi Qingcheng.

It really was.

“Although she knew that Lin Ze did not like her, when she heard that the person in Lin Ze’s heart was actually Shi Qingcheng, Bai Jingshu’s heart felt as if it was weighed down by a thousand-pound stone. She could not breathe properly. ”

The most beautiful thing in the world was that the person she liked also happened to like her.

But how could there be so many beautiful things?

Bai Jingshu let out a long sigh in her heart.

“Lin Ze then asked in return, “What About You? Do you have someone you like?” ”

“Yes.”Bai Jing nodded.

“It was a pity that there were trees and branches on the mountain, and the heart pleased the monarch but the monarch did not know. ” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Do I know the person you like?”Lin Ze asked.

“Bai Jingshu hesitated for a moment and did not say anything. After a moment, she continued, “I know him.” ”

Know Him?

“Lin Ze raised his eyebrows slightly and said with a smile, “We don’t know many people in common. You Don’t like me, do you?” ”

“Upon hearing this, Bai Jingshu was immediately stunned. She thought that she had heard wrongly. ”

What was Lin Ze saying?

How did he see through her?

What should she do now?

Should she admit it?

“If she did, how could they be friends in the future? ”

“Bai Jingshu’s face was very red. Fortunately, the lighting in the broadcast room was not very bright, which covered the redness on her face. ”

“”You’re admitting it by not saying anything?”Lin Ze smiled. “Miss Bai Jingshu, what a coincidence. The person I like is you too.” ”

“What?”Bai Jingshu looked up at Lin Ze in disbelief.

Lin Ze was a person who knew how to seize the moment. He knew that this was the best time for him to express his feelings. He pulled Bai Jingshu’s wrist through his clothes. “Come out with me.”

“Before Bai Jingshu could react, Lin Ze had already pulled her to her feet. ”

“”Bend down,”Lin ze reminded her in a low voice. ”

Bai Jingshu immediately bent down and followed Lin ze out of the theater.

Lin Ze pulled Bai Jingshu along and ran all the way out of the theater.

“The summer breeze blew gently. Compared to the stuffy theater, standing outside was more refreshing. ”

“Lin Ze was still holding Bai Jingshu’s hand. Their eyes met, and they were speechless. ”

“Lin Ze looked at Bai Jingshu, and his heart was racing. ”

Bai Jingshu wasn’t feeling any better either. Her cheeks were slightly burning.

“Lin Ze’s words in the broadcast hall were still ringing in her ears, but Bai Jingshu didn’t know if they were true... Or if she was hearing things. ”

“After a long while, Bai Jingshu finally composed herself and looked up at Lin Ze. “What... What do you want to tell me?” ”

“Lin Ze was no longer nervous when he was at his most nervous. He looked down at Bai Jingshu and said, “Miss Bai Jingshu, I like you. What About You?” ”

Like.

Lin Ze liked her?

“Bai Jingshu was stunned when she heard that. Her ears buzzed, and her heart felt like it was about to jump out of her chest at any moment. ”

Perhaps only those who had experienced it before could understand this wonderful feeling. Words could not describe it at all.

Bai Jingshu even forgot how to react.

“At this moment, Lin Ze continued, “Miss Bai Jingshu?” ”

Bai Jingshu finally reacted. She raised her head and looked at Lin Ze. “You... you really like me?”

“”Yes.”Lin Ze nodded. “This is my first time liking someone. If I do something wrong, please advise me.” ”

Lin Ze wasn’t sure if his actions had offended the beauty.

“After saying that, Lin ze paused and continued, “Miss Bai Jingshu, I really like you. Can you agree to Mr. Lin Ze’s request?”After saying that, Lin Ze placed his hand in front of Bai Jingshu. ”
