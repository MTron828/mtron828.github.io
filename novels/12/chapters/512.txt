“When the time came, the scene would definitely be spectacular! ”

Perhaps Lin ze would recognize her good qualities and choose her as his younger sister.

Lin family.

“Lin Jincheng was arranging for someone to redecorate the third floor. Although ye Shu had yet to give him a clear answer, regardless of the outcome, he had to prepare a room for the mother and daughter at home. ”

“Lin Jincheng looked at the renovation design and asked Lin Ze, “Ah Ze, what do you think about giving this room to your sister as a bedroom? “If you think it’s good, then I’ll get someone to open up the empty room next door to your sister’s cloakroom. If she likes to raise flowers and small animals, then we’ll leave a small room here. Then, we can put a piano here and place some antiques here...”. ... .. ”

Lin Ze stood at the door of the room and nodded. “I think it’s fine.”

“Lin Jincheng scratched his head and continued, “Then, the only thing left is the color scheme. I don’t know what colors girls like to decorate.”Lin Jincheng had never raised a daughter before. Other than his four older brothers, he didn’t have any other sisters, he didn’t even have a niece. Naturally, he didn’t know what little girls liked these days. ”

“”HMM, Pink?”Lin Ze was the same. He didn’t like to interact with girls since he was young, so he didn’t know what to do when he suddenly had a sister. ”

“Lin Jincheng frowned. “But I don’t think your sister is the kind of little girl who likes Pink, right?” ”

“”I think so...”Lin ze recalled the style of ye Zhuo’s clothes every time he saw her. “Why don’t we use black and white? Try to keep it simple. When the time comes, we can let the designer change what she likes.” ”

“Lin Jincheng nodded and felt that Lin Ze’s plan was very feasible, so he took the design to consult with the designer. ”

“Looking at the busy Lin Jincheng, Lin Ze silently opened the mobile phone search engine, search:”What does sister like?”? An album ”

What color do cool girls like

What kind of brother doesn’t my sister like

[ how can I be a good brother? ]

[ the standard of a good brother. ]

[ what if my sister doesn’t like me? ]

[ how can I make my sister accept me. ]

[ what kind of brother does my sister hate? ]

“There were all kinds of strange answers on the Internet. The more Lin ze read, the more fascinated he became. His beautiful eyebrows furrowed slightly. After reading for more than an hour, Lin Ze closed the web page, opened wechat, and sent a message to the group. ”

[ I’m going to have a sister. ]

The originally quiet group was awakened by this message.

“Dog Two: [ F * ck! Brother ZE, ARE YOU SERIOUS? ] ”

Fat Tiger: [ Who’s Our Sister? ]

Li Wen: [ is she the school Belle? ]

“Lin Ze: [@li Wen, you guessed it right. She’s My Sister. ] ”

“Dog Two: [ brother Ze, stop joking. ] ”

Fat Tiger: [ bragging! ]

Li Wen: [ ... this joke is outdated. ]

The three of them felt that Lin Ze was joking with them.

“Although they felt that ye Zhuo indeed looked like Lin Ze, there was no such thing as a coincidence in this world. ”

Lin Ze: [ bring her out to introduce you to her some other day. ]

Fat Tiger: [ screenshot. ]

Li Wen: [ screenshot. ]

Dog Two: [ screenshot. ]

Lin Ze looked at his phone screen and a faint smile appeared on his face.

“At this moment, a doctor walked in from outside. “President Lin, it’s time to take your medicine.” ”

“Lin Jincheng’s health was still very poor. After experiencing great sorrow and joy for the past few days, he was much worse. On average, he would take his medicine every three hours or so. ”

“At night, he also had to rely on medicine to fall asleep. ”

...

“On the other side, at the Ye residence. ”

Ye Shu did not sleep the entire night.

“The next morning, her dark circles were a little heavy. ” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Ye Zhuo picked up a glass of milk. “Mom, did you not sleep well last night?” ”

“Ye Shu nodded. Compared to before, Ye Shu’s smile was also much less. ”

“Right now, it was as if she was standing at a fork in the road in her life. She did not know what to choose at all. ”

She had missed out on nineteen years with Lin Jincheng. was there really still a chance?

“But when she thought of Lin Ze, her heart softened. ”

“No matter what happened between adults, children were always innocent. ”

“In the first nineteen years, she did not fulfill her responsibility as a mother, nor did she let Lin Ze enjoy the love of a mother. ”

“For the rest of her life, she wanted to make it up to Lin Ze. ”

“Seeing ye Shu like this, Ye Sen wanted to say something, but in the end, he did not say anything. His mouth was stupid, and he had little experience in relationships. He had even been lied to twice in a row, if he brought ye Shu into the ditch, it wouldn’t be worth it. ”
