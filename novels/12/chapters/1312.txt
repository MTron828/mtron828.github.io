“Zheng wanyin said, “I know you’re not that kind of person. I was just saying it casually.” ”

“”Excuse me.”At this moment, a gentle female voice sounded in the air. ”

Zheng Wanyin turned around and saw a petite figure.

The person was about 1.57 meters tall. Her skin was a very healthy wheat color. She had an exquisite baby face and looked very cute.

“However, after she entered, everyone in the preparation room looked at her strangely. ”

Zheng Wanyin took a step back and let the baby face pass.

“”Thank you,”the baby face thanked her. ”

Zheng Wanyin nodded.

The short-haired girl looked at the baby face’s back and her eyes were filled with disgust. “Why is she here too?”

“Bad Luck!”

“Zheng Wanyin held the short-haired girl’s hand. “Don’t say that. Actually, Xiaosu is quite pitiful too.” ”

The baby-faced girl’s full name was Bai Xiaosu.

Every member of the ABA had entered by relying on their own abilities. Only Bai Xiaosu was different.

Bai Xiaosu had entered by accident.

“Moreover, Bai Xiaosu was a person with an eccentric personality. She was timid and afraid of trouble. She was not capable enough. There were a few times when she was almost kicked out of the ABA. It was said that it was the backstage that protected her. ”

“Therefore, the people in the core group did not like her very much. ”

This caused Bai Xiaosu to be a loner. It had been more than a year since she joined the ABA and she still did not have a good friend.

“”What’s there to be pitiful about! She’s a Jinx!”The short-haired girl continued, “If it wasn’t for her, we wouldn’t have lost so badly in the previous mission!” ”

“”Actually, that’s not what Xiaosu wanted to see.” ”

“The short-haired girl looked at Zheng wanyin, “Wanyin, I’m not as magnanimous as you!” ”

Zheng Wanyin did not say anything.

“The short-haired girl continued, “Oh right, what is Bai Xiaosu doing here? Could it be that she’s also here for the assessment?” ”

Zheng Wanyin nodded. “I think so.”

“”Just her? I think she’s just here for the head count! Not to mention 3A, it’s already pretty good that she’s able to get 1a! She only knows how to Hold Us Back!” ”

“Zheng wanyin said, “The important thing is to participate. If she’s able to participate in this assessment, it means that she’s motivated. If she’s motivated, then she’s not incurable.” ”

“A girl at the side said, “Actually, Bai Xiaosu has been working hard during this period of time. Who knows, she might really get 1a!” ”

The short-haired girl rolled her eyes. “Why? Are you going to speak up for her?”

The girl immediately shook her head. “No! That’s not what I meant!”

Bai Xiaosu was the jinx of the entire core team. Anyone who got close to Bai Xiaosu would immediately be isolated by everyone.

On the other side.

Xie wanqiu went to find Zhou Xiang.

Zhou Xiang was overjoyed when she found out that ye Zhuo was the main examiner today.

“”Xiang Xiang, come with me for a moment,”Xie wanqiu said. ”

“What’s the matter?”Zhou Xiang asked.

“Xie wanqiu frowned. “If I told you to come, then come. Why are you talking so much?” ”

Zhou Xiang stood up from her chair and followed Xie Wanqiu to an empty lounge.

“Xiang Xiang.”

“Go ahead.”Zhou Xiang subconsciously felt that there was nothing good about Xie wanqiu calling her over.

“Xie wanqiu continued, “Do you know that Ye Zhuo is the main examiner today?” ”

Zhou Xiang nodded. “I just found out too.” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Xie wanqiu looked at Zhou Xiang. “Let me ask you, are you yinyin’s biological second aunt? Did you treat yinyin as your biological niece?” ”

“”If you have anything to say, just say it,”Zhou Xiang said. ”

“Answer my question First!”

“Zhou Xiang said, “Mom, the assessment is about to begin. If you have anything to say, just say it. There’s no need to beat around the bush with me.” ”

“Xie wanqiu sighed, “You really didn’t take me as your biological mother!”! “Poor me. I raised you from a young age. Now that I’m married and have children, I can turn my back on you. No wonder the old saying goes, you can’t feed other people’s children well!”! “Why can’t I Learn? !” ”

A handful of SH * t and a handful of urine?

“When Xie Wanqiu married into the Zhou family, Zhou Xiang was already in her teens! ”

“However, Zhou Xiang couldn’t be bothered to argue with her. No matter what, Xie Wanqiu was still her stepmother. This was a fact that no one could change. ”

“In order to appease Xie wanqiu, Zhou Xiang continued, “Mom, you’ve always been my biological mother! Wanyin is also my biological niece!” ”

“Hearing this, Xie Wanqiu’s eyes lit up and she immediately grabbed Zhou Xiang’s hand. “Since you treat yinyin as your biological niece, you must help Yinyin this time!” ”

“Help? How?”Zhou Xiang asked in confusion.

“Seeing Zhou Xiang pretending to be confused, Xie Wanqiu felt very uncomfortable. ”
