Translator: 549690339

“As soon as ye Zao said this, a bright light appeared in the air. ”

It was so bright that it was hard to open one’s eyes.

“However, after a few seconds, the light disappeared completely, as if this had never happened. ”

Cen Shaoqing turned to look at ye Zao. “Try again.”

“”Okay.”Ye Zao nodded slightly, walked over, and pressed the start button. ”

Beep.

The interstellar shuttle has been activated!

It has been successfully activated!

“A light appeared in ye Zao’s eyes, and he pressed the bracelet on his wrist. ”

Pa..

The cabin door opened automatically.

“A strong light flashed, and Ye Zao, who was next to Cen Shaoqing, instantly shrunk until he was the size of an ant-man. ”

“The interstellar shuttle was meant to fly in the quantum domain, and if it was too big, it would affect its speed. ”

“Therefore, ye Zao used the perpetual motion machine on the interstellar shuttle and used the technology of atomic distance reduction and mass reduction to shrink his body. ”

“Seeing this scene, Cen Shaoqing was not surprised. His expression did not change. ”

“Ye Zao looked at his shrunken version of himself. After a moment, he looked up at Cen Shaoqing. “Cen Shaoqing, I’ll go in and try.” ”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

Ye Zhuo opened the cabin door and entered the driver’s seat.

“The Interstellar Shuttle, which was originally only the size of a toy, now looked like a colossus as ye Zhuo’s body shrunk. The various instruments inside were also extremely sophisticated. ”

— please set the planet’s location!

Ye Zhuo entered the location of Planet E-TY889.

— searching. Please wait a moment.

“In less than a minute, the interstellar navigation system had located the location of Planet E-TY889 in the s galaxy. ”

A total of three million light years!

The sailing time was three days.

“On average, the sailing time was one million light years per day. ”

“Ye Zhuo tried the other equipment in the shuttle. After checking that there were no mistakes, she walked out of the shuttle. ”

She jumped directly from the shuttle to the ground.

“As soon as her feet touched the ground, her figure returned to normal. ”

“How is it?”Cen Shaoqing looked at her.

“”Not bad,”ye Zhuo answered. “It will take three days to go to changyue from Mars. Plus, I have some things to deal with. I might need some time to come back.” ”

“When are you going to go?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“”About ten days later,”ye Zhuo continued, “There are still a few days until my mother’s birthday. I plan to celebrate her birthday before I leave.” ”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Ye Zao took out the jade fragment from the groove and continued, “How did you know that the jade fragment had to be broken before it could be used?”She had studied the jade for a very long time, but she still could not figure out the secret behind it. ”

“After a long period of separation, it would definitely be reunited, and after a long period of separation, it would definitely be divided. ”

“All things in the world, there were all sorts of changes, and they would not deviate from each other’s principles. ”

The energy within the jade fragment was like nine links. It had to be broken before one could see the secret within.

“I guessed.”Cen Shaoqing’s eyes were deep and he could not see the bottom.

“After saying that, Cen Shaoqing looked at ye Zao and continued, “Zao Zao, have you recovered all your memories?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“Ever since the last hypnosis, her memories had been almost completely estranged. ”

This was the main reason why she could not wait to return to the Chang Yue Kingdom.

She wanted to find out the whole truth.

“”I have something to show you,”Cen Shao Qing said proudly. “Burning, come with me.” ”

“Okay.”Ye burning followed Cen Shao Qing’s footsteps.

Cen Shao Qing brought ye burning to the office and took out a green chip to pass to ye burning.

“Do you recognize this?”

“Ye burning took the chip and frowned slightly. After a while, she said slowly, “This is the chip of the core robot, but this thing should only be found on high level space civilizations, where did you come from?” ”

“From its appearance, the core robot was no different from humans. ”

It had its own emotions and consciousness. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“However, they were different from humans. They didn’t need to breathe, they didn’t feel pain, they didn’t know how to taste, and they didn’t know how to feel hungry, but they needed to be charged. ”

“However, the high-level core robot didn’t need to be charged, it only needed to be charged once a week. ”

“For example, the chip in Cen Shaoqing’s hand was from the high-level core robot! ”

“Earth’s space civilization was still developing, so they couldn’t produce such a core robot yet. ”

“”Core Robot?”CEN Shaoqing asked, “So this means that this thing probably came from s Galaxy?” ”

“”I’m not sure,”ye Zhuo continued, “I’ll go decipher the code on it.” ”

Cen Shaoqing followed ye Zhuo’s footsteps.

“Ye Zao came to the machine room, took out a dedicated computer, and began to decode it. ”

“Although the core robot was a product of the advanced universe, Ye Zao was still a big shot from the S Galaxy after all. Deciphering such a thing was not difficult for her. ”
