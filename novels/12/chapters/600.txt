“Chapter 601: 144: face-smacking, glorious! 3”

Translator: 549690339

He was a third-year student.

“Perhaps he did not expect Dr. YC to be so young and so beautiful. When Ye Zao gave him the medal, his ears turned slightly red. “Thank you, Dr. YC.””

“You’re welcome. Keep up the good work.”

The first place went to Lin Ze.

Although Lin Ze had been prepared for ye Zao to be Dr. YC from the moment ye Zao appeared.

“However, when ye Zao officially announced ye Zao’s identity, Lin Ze was still shocked.”

From Hacker Z to Dr. YC.

Just how many aspects of Ye Zao were unknown.

His sister was so outstanding. It seemed that he had to work harder and not drag down the family!

“Thinking of this, Lin Ze’s eyes were filled with determination.”

“Ye Zao picked up the medal and put it on Lin Ze. He said in a low voice, “Brother, Congratulations.””

The value of the science and technology competition was very high.

Lin Ze’s actual results were much better than the other two.

She was different from Lin Ze.

“After all, she had reached the top of the science and technology world in her previous life.”

This meant that Lin Ze had a lot of achievements in scientific research.

His future was limitless!

“After the award ceremony, the three of them still had to give their acceptance speeches.”

“Feng Xianxian had prepared a long speech, but now, her mind was in a mess. She couldn’t remember a single word of the acceptance speech she had prepared.”

She could only stand in front of the microphone and thank everyone dryly.

The fact that Ye Zhuo was Dr. YC was a huge blow to Feng Xianxian.

“If there was a crack in the ground, she would have crawled down.”

“At this moment, she was standing on the stage.”

She was like a clown.

“As the founder of the award, Ye Zao also gave his speech on the stage.”

Looking at ye Zao on the stage.

Li Yueyue pinched herself hard several times before she believed that this was not an illusion.

Ye Zao was Dr. YC.

He really was!

No wonder ye Zao confidently said that he was YC in the dormitory yesterday.

Li Yueyue remembered that she said she was YC’s daughter yesterday.

Now her face hurt.

Too Awesome! Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Ye Zao was simply too awesome!

“After the award ceremony, Ye Shu and Lin Jincheng carried the flowers onto the stage.”

The Lin family’s relatives also surrounded them to congratulate Lin ze and ye Zao.

“In the eyes of the Lin family’s relatives, Ye Shu was now a winner in life.”

First place in the Son’s science and Technology Award.

The daughter was the founder of the award!

A son and a daughter each had their own merits.

Neither of them could lose to the other.

Why didn’t they have such a good life?

“Old Mrs. Lin sat on the chair, still unable to recover.”

Someone came to congratulate Old Mrs. Lin from the side.

“”Old Mrs. Lin, Congratulations. You have two amazing grandsons and granddaughters!””

“”Old Lady, can you please teach your children how to do it?””

“Just as Old Lady Lin was about to answer, someone immediately said,”

“”I don’t think this has anything to do with education. It’s mainly the children who are doing well. Miss Ye didn’t grow up by Old Lady Lin’s side, but she still became a doctor!””

Ye Zhuo followed ye Shu.

“If he really wanted to ask for advice, he should ask ye Shu.”

What did it have to do with Old Lady Lin?

“If Lin Ze didn’t follow Old Lady Lin, he might be as outstanding as ye Zao!”

Old Lady Lin’s face stiffened when she understood the meaning behind these words.

“She never expected that her granddaughter, whom she despised the most, would one day be so glorious and become the envy of everyone.”

“For a moment, Old Lady Lin had a myriad of thoughts.”

Feng Qianhua had also prepared flowers for Feng Qianxian.

“But now, there was no need to bring them out.”

“With Ye Zhuoyu in front of her, if she brought out flowers now, she would only embarrass herself.”

“After all, in the eyes of everyone, Feng Qianxian had always been better than ye Zhuoyu.”

And Now?

How many people could see Feng Qianxian?

Feng Qianhua kicked the flowers on the ground to the bottom of the stairs in the audience seats.

“Feng Qianxian walked to Feng Qianhua’s side with difficulty. “Mom, Grandma, I’m sorry. I’ve disappointed you.””

“”It’s okay.”Feng Qianhua tried her best to smile, suppressing all her anger.”

“Although Feng Qianhua was very angry, she did not lose her mind.”

“After all, this was a public place.”

“Old Lady Lin was sitting next to Feng Qianhua. When she saw Feng Qianhua like this, her heart instantly ached, “It’s okay, Xianxian. Jin Wuzu is a complete person. Although you can’t compare to searing in this aspect, you’re still better than her in other aspects.””

It was fine if Old Lady Lin didn’t say anything.

“When Old Lady Lin said this, Feng Xianxian felt even worse.”

“It must be known that before this, Old Lady Lin had always called ye Zao a wild girl.”
