Translator: 549690339

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Lizi, you can’t mess with seniority. He should have called you cousin.””

Cen Shaoqing nodded. “Zao Zao is right.”

“An Lizi:”...”So, was she being fed dog food?”

“After a series of ceremonies, Lin Qingxuan carried Xia Xiaoman into the wedding car.”

The motorcade drove directly to the hotel.

“Old Mrs. Cen didn’t come, so the witnesses of the wedding were Lin Qingfan and Wu Mei.”

The two of them sat at the head of the viewing platform and accepted the kneeling worship of a couple. They offered tea.

“Xia Xiaoman picked up the tea. “Big Brother, please have some tea.””

“Okay.”

Lin Qingfan placed a thick red packet on the tray.

“”Sister-in-law, please have some tea.””

“Wu Mei smiled as she picked up the Teacup. “Xiao Man, from now on, you’re a part of the Lin family. Sister-in-law wishes you and Qingxuan a long and happy life together.””

“”Thank you, sister-in-law.””

Wu Mei also placed a thick red packet on the tray.

“After the change of topic, it was time for the other segments.” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“In order to liven up the atmosphere, Lin Qingxuan specially invited a famous television host for the wedding ceremony.”

The wedding only officially ended at nine o’clock in the evening.

“Lin Qing Xuan brought Xia Xiao Man to toast his brothers and sisters-in-law. “Big Brother and sister-in-law, second brother and sister-in-law, third brother and sister-in-law, Jin city’s fifth brother and sister-in-law. Thank you so much for today!””

“If it weren’t for the full support of the Lin Brothers, the wedding wouldn’t have gone so smoothly.”

“Lin Qing fan raised his cup and said, “It’s only right for brothers to help each other. Don’t say anything else. Just Live Well with your fourth brother and sister in the future.””

“I will.”Lin Qingxuan nodded.

“After the wedding, Old Lady Cen came to the Lin family home.”

“”Old Lady, Old Lady Cen is here.”Auntie Wang came in to inform Old Lady Lin.”

“Old Lady Lin asked curiously, “Why is she here?””

“Old Lady Cen smiled and walked in. “Of course, she’s here to congratulate you.””

“Congratulate what?”Old Lady Lin looked at Old Lady Cen in confusion.

Could it be that something good had happened to the Lin family recently?

“Old Mrs. Cen pretended to be puzzled and said, “You still don’t Know?””

“Know what?”

Old Mrs. Cen narrowed her eyes. “It seems that you really don’t know! I was wondering why you didn’t appear at the wedding today! So you still don’t know!”

“Wedding? Who Got Married?”Old Mrs. Lin’s eyebrows inexplicably jumped.

“Old Lady Cen smiled and said, “Of course Qingxuan got married! You Don’t know how lively the wedding ceremony is today. Almost all of Your Lin family’s relatives are present!””

Lin Qingxuan got married?

Who Did Lin Qingxuan get married to?

Could It Be Xia Xiaoman?

No!

Impossible!

Old Lady Cen must be lying to her.

Lin Qingxuan didn’t get her consent. How could he marry Xia Xiaoman casually?

Old Mrs. Cen saw through Old Mrs. Lin’s thoughts. She took out her phone and pulled out the video that was recorded today. “Take a good look and see if this is your Qingxuan.”

Old Mrs. Lin was dumbfounded when she saw the video.

Her blood boiled.

It was Lin Qingxuan!

It was really Lin Qingxuan!

Lin Qingxuan really married Xia Xiaoman.

How did he dare?

How did he dare?

Old Lady Lin had originally thought that Lin Qingxuan had come to inform her about this matter yesterday just to probe her. Old Lady Lin had never dreamed that Lin Qingxuan would actually marry Xia Xiaoman!

It had gone against the grain!

It had gone against the grain!

It had gone against the grain!

“Without her mother around, Lin Qingxuan had actually dared to marry Xia Xiaoman on his own.”

Old Lady Lin’s blood rushed to her heart. Her vision turned black and she fainted just like that.

“Old Lady Cen said speechlessly, “Look at this old lady! Why is she so anxious?””

“Auntie Wang was shocked. “Old Lady, Are You Alright?””

“Old Lady Cen walked over and pressed on Old Lady Lin’s Ren Zhong acupoint. She said in surprise, “D * mn! She really fainted!”She thought that Old Lady Lin was faking it, but she did not expect that this old lady actually fainted.”

“Old Mrs. Cen instructed Auntie Wang to call the family doctor over. Then, she instructed two servants to carry old Mrs. Lin onto the bed.”

“After a series of first aid measures by the Doctor, Old Mrs. Lin finally woke up. “Auntie Wang!””

“”Old Lady, please speak.””

“Old Mrs. Lin continued, “Go and call Qingxuan! Tell him to get his ass back here right now! Otherwise, he will never be able to see his mother again!””

Auntie Wang quickly went to make the call.

“A few minutes later, Auntie Wang jogged over. “Old Madam, Qingxuan’s phone is switched off.””

Switched Off?

“Old Madam Lin continued, “Then call the others! Call boss and Wu Mei! I’d like to ask them who gave them the courage to overstep their boundaries and officiate Qingxuan’s wedding! “Do they all think I’m Dead?””

She was still here!

These people actually dared to ignore him!

They were all lawless!

“Auntie Wang called Lin Qingfan and his wife again. After a while, she said, “Their phones are switched off too.””

The Lin family’s brothers seemed to have made an agreement as they all switched off their phones.

“Old Lady Lin was furious. “I don’t want to live anymore! I Don’t want to live anymore either! What’s the point of living in this world now? Auntie Wang, go and contact them now and tell them to come back and collect my body!””

“Old Lady Cen immediately handed Old Lady Lin a rope, “Hang yourself! Although hanging yourself is a little ugly, the process shouldn’t be very painful. Besides, I’m watching by your side. I’ll immediately get someone to collect your body so that no one can see your remains.””

Auntie Wang was shocked.

She never expected that old lady cen would hand over a rope at this time and ask Old Lady Lin to hang herself.

Wasn’t this adding fuel to the fire?

“What was even more unexpected to Auntie Wang was that old lady cen immediately handed over a fruit knife, “If you don’t want to hang yourself, then commit hara-kiri suicide. Although hara-kiri suicide is a little more painful than hanging yourself, hara-kiri suicide is a greater deterrent! You have to let the children see your determination to commit suicide!””

Auntie Wang gulped.

“Seeing that old Mrs. Lin did not have any reaction, old Mrs. Cen handed over another bottle of pesticide, “Hara-kiri is indeed a little painful! I know that you are most afraid of pain. Why Don’t you just drink the medicine! This is called paraquat, and its toxicity is very strong. As long as you drink it, even if a great god was present, he would not be able to reverse the situation! The more miraculous thing is that this medicine won’t take effect immediately. It will swallow you bit by bit while you are conscious. This will give you just enough time to let you see the children regret it.””

“Looking at the things that old Mrs. Cen handed over, Old Mrs. Lin was immediately stunned. She didn’t want to live anymore and just casually said that she wanted to scare a few of the Lin family’s brothers. How could she have thought that.., old Mrs. Cen would prepare everything so well?”

“Even the rope, the fruit knife, and the paraquat were all prepared!”
