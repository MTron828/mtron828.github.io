She had always looked indifferent.

“If she had not seen it with her own eyes, who would believe that this was a 19-year-old child? ”

“The admiration in Master Yu’s eyes became more obvious. He continued, “You are called Zao Zao, right?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“Master Yu smiled and said, “Then I will call you zhuozhuo from now on. You should stop calling me master Yu all the time. I am of the same generation as your grandfather. You Should Call Me Grandpa Yu from now on, right?” ”

“Hearing this, Feng Xianxian could not help but grit her teeth. ”

Grandpa Yu?

“Ye Zhuo, this little B * TCH, what right did she have? ”

She should be the one who should call Master Yu Grandpa Yu!

“Fortunately, Ye Zhuo was not as good at literature as she was. ”

“Otherwise, she would have completely lost her sense of presence in front of ye Zhuo. ”

“Ye Zhuo was not pretentious. He smiled and said, “Grandpa Yu.” ”

Master Yu nodded in satisfaction.

It was a pity that ye Zhuo was not his biological granddaughter.

“If she was his biological granddaughter, he definitely would not be like Old Lady Lin, who did not know how to appreciate her blessings! ”

“She had such a kind granddaughter, yet she did not know how to cherish it! ”

“Thinking of this, master Yu turned to look at Old Lady Lin. “Old sister-in-law, I have a few words to say to you in private.” ”

Old Lady Lin nodded. “Then let’s go to the study.”

The two of them went to the study.

“Master Yu was the first to speak. “Old sister-in-law, your granddaughter’s future is limitless. You must not ignore her. You must nurture her well.” ”

Limitless?

What was limitless about someone like ye Zhuo!

“However, the other party was master Yu after all. Furthermore, Ye Zhuo had just saved Master Yu’s life. Old Lady Lin said, “Alright, Jingshan. I will take your words to heart.” ”

“Seeing Old Lady Lin like this, master Yu heaved a sigh of relief. ”

“Old Lady Lin continued, “Jingshan, what do you think of Xianxian? To tell you the truth, Xianxian has been by my side since she was young. I treat her like my own granddaughter.” ”

Master Yu nodded. “She’s pretty good.”

“Hearing this, Old Lady Lin’s eyes lit up. She continued, “Jingshan, do you think you can take Feng Xianxian as your last disciple?” ”

Last Disciple?

Master Yu was stunned.

He had indeed come here to take in a disciple.

“However, Feng Xianxian had yet to meet his standards. ”

“Master Yu continued, “Sister-in-law, taking in a disciple is not a small matter. I have to consider it.”He and Old Master Lin were close friends, but it was a pity that old master Lin had left early. Now, Old Lady Lin was the only one left. ”

It would be too unreasonable to reject Old Lady Lin directly. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“If he did not find that little girl in Yun Jing City, perhaps he would consider accepting Feng Xianxian as his disciple. ”

“After all, Old Lady Lin had never asked him for anything in her life. ”

“However, if he found that little girl, he could only reject her. ”

Master Yu only wanted to take in two disciples in his life.

The first disciple and the last disciple.

“When she heard that Master Yu would consider it, Old Lady Lin’s eyes lit up. “Jingshan, then you must consider it carefully! Xianxian is a really good child!” ”

As long as master Yu agreed to consider it.

There was hope for this matter.

“Master Yu nodded slightly, then, he said, “Elder sister-in-law, to be honest with you, I have other candidates in mind. However, I can only choose one of these two people. If I fail to choose that little lass from the Feng family, don’t blame me.” ”

“I won’t! I Won’t! Don’t Worry!”

Who else could be more outstanding than Feng Xianxian?

Old Lady Lin was filled with confidence in Feng Xianxian.

“Master Yu continued, “Old sister-in-law, it’s good that you know what you’re doing.” ”

Master Yu stayed at the Lin residence until the afternoon before setting off for Yun Jing.

Master Yu had just left.

“Feng Qianhua came over to Old Madam Lin to inquire about the news. “Aunt Lin, did you tell Master Yu About Xianxian?” ”

“Don’t worry.”Old Madam Lin nodded. “How could I forget such an important matter?”

“Feng Qianhua continued, “Then what did Master Yu Say?”Feng Xianxian was so outstanding. She was only nineteen years old, but she was already able to write a peerless calligraphy piece. There was no reason for Master Yu not to accept Feng Xianxian as his disciple. ”

Old Madam Lin raised her head to look at Feng Qianhua. “Master Yu said that he wanted to consider it.”

“Hearing this, Feng Qianhua’s expression lit up. ”

“He said that he wanted to consider it, but it was probably just to keep her in suspense. ”

“After all, master Yu’s identity was not simple. ”

It was not easy to take in a disciple.

That’s great!

That’s really great!

“Feng Qianhua looked gratefully at Old Madam Lin. “Aunt Lin, thank you so much!” ”
