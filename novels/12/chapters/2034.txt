And she kept a photo of him from 1 to 15 years old.

One photo every year.

“After the age of 15, it was recorded in the information that Guangxing was admitted to the International Military Academy and had to enter secret training, so there were no photos. ”

“The facial features of a 15-year-old child had gradually taken shape, especially a small heart-shaped birthmark on the left side of Guangxing’s forehead. ”

“Yi Ling looked at the photo, then looked at the youth locked in the iron cage, and then carefully compared the birthmark on his forehead. Only then did she confirm that he was guangxing. ”

“After learning this conclusion, Yi Ling was very confused. ”

A vicious tiger would not eat its own son.

Why did the sixth clan leader lock Guangxing in the Iron Cage?

This was his own son!

“If it was not for the careful comparison, Yi Ling would never have believed that this was true! ”

“Why did the sixth clan leader do this?”Yi Ling asked.

“Ye Zhuo narrowed his eyes and did not directly answer Yi Ling. He continued, “Go and open the lock on the Iron Cage.” ”

“Alright.”Yi Ling immediately flew over and unlocked the lock on the cage.

“However, when she unlocked the lock on the youth’s hand, she was unable to unlock it no matter how hard she tried. Helpless, Yi Ling could only ask ye Zhuo for help, “Great burning, this lock can not be unlocked!” ”

“Ye Zao walked forward, took off the black hair clip on his head, inserted it into the lock hole, and gently pulled it. ”

“Padah –”

The lock core was removed just like that.

“The chain was very thick, leaving deep marks on the young man’s wrist. ”

“After undoing one side of the lock, Ye Zao went to undo the lock on the other hand of the young man, followed by the anklet. ”

“Throughout the entire process, the young man just looked at Ye Zao. ”

“Even after unlocking all the chains, the young man still maintained his previous state. He did not look at ye Zao at all, as if he had been frozen. ”

“Are You Guangxing?”Ye Zao said calmly.

“Her words seemed to have turned on some switch. The young man hugged her and cried, “Grandma! Grandma! I knew Grandma would definitely come to save Xing ‘er...” ”

Grandma?

Ye Zhuo was stunned.

When did she have such a grandson! !

Yi Ling was also stunned.

No one had expected guangxing to do this.

Ye Zhuo pushed him away gently. “You’ve got the wrong person. I’m not your grandma.”

“”You’re Grandma! You’re Grandma!”The youth’s face was full of tears, he looked at Ye Zhuo, he said aggrievedly, “Grandma, did Xing ‘er do something wrong! You Can’t not want Xing ‘er! Grandma, are you blaming Xing ‘er for not avenging mother? Grandma, don’t worry, I’ll definitely kill that murderer!” ”

“At this point, the youth was agitated. His eyes turned red as if he could go berserk at any time. ”

“To temporarily calm his emotions, ye Zao said, “I won’t leave if you listen to me.” ”

“”Listen, Xing ‘er, listen.”The youth gripped the corner of ye Zao’s clothes tightly. His eyes were filled with vigilance, afraid that ye Zao would run away in the next second. “Grandma, Xing ‘er will listen obediently. Grandma, don’t go!” ”

“Ye Zao continued, “Give me your hand.” ”

The youth immediately extended his hand.

“Ye Zao placed his hand on his pulse and focused slightly. According to his pulse, ye Zao could tell that the youth had gone insane due to the stimulation, resulting in his current appearance. ”

“A moment later, ye Zao retracted his hand and took out a pill from his bag. “Take this pill.” ”

The youth took the pill and swallowed it without thinking.

“”Grandma, are you here to bring Xing ‘er back?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“That’s great! Xing ‘er can finally leave this godforsaken place!”The youth cheered.

“”Shh!”Yi Ling stretched out her wings and made a ‘hush’gesture. “Be quiet, don’t be discovered!” ”

The youth nodded.

“Yi Ling looked at ye Zao and continued, “Da Zao Zao, he calls you grandma. According to seniority, what should he call me?” ”

“Ye Zao was a little speechless as he said, “What are you thinking about?” ”

“”Should I call you great-aunt? Yes, it should be great-aunt!”Saying this, Yi Ling turned to look at the youth. “Kid, quickly call me great-aunt!” ”

“”I don’t have great-aunt.”The youth said very seriously, “And our species are different, don’t even think about taking advantage of me!” ”

“Yi Ling’s eyes widened, “You’re Not Stupid?” ”

The youth glanced at Yi Ling and did not say anything.

Yi Ling: I’ve been insulted!

“Ye Zhuo looked at his watch and continued, “The six clan leaders will be back in ten minutes, let’s leave this place first.” ”

“Alright.”Yi Ling immediately went into ye Zhuo’s backpack.

“Ye Zhuo looked at the youth, “Follow behind me.” ”

“The youth nodded and continued, “Grandma, I know an exit that leads directly to the outside of the courtyard.” ”
