Translator: 549690339

The Day After Tomorrow is Old Lady Lin’s 78th birthday.

There will be a bunch of people coming to celebrate her birthday.

“Ye Zhuo brought the old man to the birthday banquet and publicly tarnished the Lin family. When that time comes, Will Old Lady Lin still be able to tolerate her? ”

Just thinking about it made Feng Qianhua feel extremely carefree!

Old Lady Lin nodded. “Then I’ll listen to You!”

“Hearing that, a gleeful light flashed across Feng Qianhua’s eyes. ”

Ye Zhuo was just waiting to be embarrassed.

“When that time came, the most outstanding person in the Lin family would still be Feng Xianxian. ”

After Feng Qianhua and her daughter left.

Old Lady Lin called Lin Jincheng over.

“”Mother, is there something you need from me?” ”

Old Lady Lin looked at Lin Jincheng. “Do you know that your daughter has found a boyfriend outside?”

Lin Jincheng was stunned.

Ye Zao found a boyfriend?

Why didn’t he know?

Old Madam Lin could see the thoughts in Lin Jincheng’s eyes. “So you still don’t Know?”

Lin Jincheng nodded.

“Ask her to bring him back the day after tomorrow and show him to all of us.”

“Lin Jincheng continued, “Where did you hear that ye Zao has a boyfriend? What if he doesn’t?” ” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“”Do you think I would malign her?”Old Lady Lin Glanced at Lin Jincheng. “Why don’t you ask her yourself!”If not for Feng Xianxian saying that ye Zao’s boyfriend was considered outstanding.., old Lady Lin couldn’t even be bothered to see him! ”

Lin Jincheng frowned. “Then I’ll go back and ask her.”

“After returning from Old Lady Lin’s side, Lin Jincheng went straight to ye Zao’s room and knocked on the door. ”

“Ye Zao was sitting in front of his computer. Without raising his head, he said, “Xiao Baibai, go and open the door.” ”

“Okay.”Xiao Baibai went to open the door.

“”Hello, daddy!”Seeing that it was Lin Jincheng outside the door, Xiao Baibai greeted politely. ”

“Lin Jincheng smiled and said, “Hello. Where’s Zao?” ”

“Xiao Baibai said, “Zao is inside!” ”

“It was said that a daughter avoided her father. Lin Jincheng was afraid that it would be inconvenient for ye Zao, so he raised his voice and asked, “Zao, Can Daddy Come In?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zao’s voice came from inside.

Only then did Lin Jincheng walk inside.

“Ye Zao stopped typing and turned to look at Lin Jincheng. “Daddy, is there something you want to ask me?” ”

Lin Jincheng nodded. “There is something small I want to ask you.”

“Please Ask.”

“Lin Jincheng swallowed his throat and suddenly felt a little nervous. “Zao Zao, do you have a boyfriend?” ”

“Ye Zao was a little surprised. “Dad, you know?” ”

Lin Jincheng felt a little uncomfortable. How could he feel good when the apple of his eye was suddenly stolen by a pig?

“”So,”Lin Jincheng raised his head and looked at ye Zao. “You really have a boyfriend?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zao didn’t plan to continue hiding it. He had to give Cen Shaoqing a status. “We’ve been together for more than three months.”

The Pearl in his palm had been held by a pig for three months...

Lin Jincheng felt his heart bleeding.

“After a long while, Lin Jincheng finally recovered and continued, “Who is that pig? Oh No, who is that person? What is his name? Do I know him? How Old is he this year? where is he from?” ”

“At this moment, Lin Jincheng even had the urge to kill a pig with a knife! ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “This is a secret for now. Why don’t I bring him back tomorrow for you and mom to see?” ”

She was looking forward to Lin Jincheng seeing the scene of Cen Shaoqing.

It would definitely be very exciting.

“Lin Jincheng continued, “The day after tomorrow is your grandmother’s birthday. Why Don’t you bring him back the day after tomorrow?” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“Lin Jincheng was now very curious about who that pig was and said, “Zao Zao, even if you don’t tell me who he is, can you tell dad where he is from?” ”

“”He’s from the capital,”ye Zhuo replied. ”

“When he heard that it was a local from the capital, Lin Jin Cheng heaved a sigh of relief. ”

“Fortunately, he was not from another city. ”

“As a father, he was most worried that his daughter would get married far away. ”

“How Old Are You?”

Ye Zhuo narrowed his eyes and gestured with his hands. “A little older than me.”

“A little older than me shouldn’t be much, right? ”

He should be at most two or three years old.

Lin Jin Cheng heaved a sigh of relief again. “Then do I know him?”

Ye Zao nodded slightly. “Yes.”

Know Him?

Lin Jin Cheng became even more curious. Countless pigs appeared in his mind. “Could it be that kid from the An Family?”

The An family had a son who was the same age as ye Zao. He was also in his first year of university this year.

“That Kid had a face that attracted many women. He was a womanizer, and it was obvious that he was not a good man. ”

If it really was him...

Then there was no need to bring him back.

Ye Zhuo shook his head.

Lin Jin Cheng heaved a sigh of relief. “Could it be Zheng Zimo?”

He saw that ye Zhuo and Zheng Zimo were quite close.

Lin Jin Cheng had a pretty good impression of this pig.
