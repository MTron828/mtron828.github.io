“But the truth was the truth. Even if they didn’t want to face it, they had to face it! ”

The head chief didn’t say anything.

“The second Chief, the fifth Chief, and the seventh chief each had their own reasons. ”

“After a moment, the head chief turned to look at the other two chiefs, “Third and fourth, what do you think?” ”

“The third chief, the fourth Chief, and the eighth chief were silent for a moment. Then, the third chief spoke, “The world is so big, anything is possible. Let’s not jump to conclusions so early. Let’s wait until the end. What if it really is Miss Ye?” ”

The first clan leader nodded. The three clan leaders’words were reasonable.

Anything was possible.

“Ye Zhuo’s life could not be replicated. If the person who came was fake and could not withstand the test, it would naturally fall apart. ”

What they needed to do now was to wait.

“The second clan leader, fifth clan leader, and seventh clan leader, who had been arguing non-stop, did not say anything after hearing these words. ”

“Qiu Di looked up at the person who came and said sternly, “Who exactly are you? What is the purpose of impersonating Miss Ye!” ”

Impersonation!

“Hearing these words, everyone below the stage was stunned. ”

Could it be that the person in front of them who looked very much like ye Zao was an impersonator?

“Who are you saying is an imposter?”A pleasant male voice came from the entrance.

Qiu Di looked up.

So it was Li Ziyue.

She knew that all of this was definitely Li Ziyue’s doing.

“Just Li Ziyue alone, what kind of Fame could he achieve? ”

“”Li Ziyue!”Qiu Di looked at Li Ziyue and continued, “Half a month ago, you betrayed the Ye family base, betrayed Miss Ye, and now you still have the face to appear here! Don’t you feel ashamed?” ”

“The people present only knew that Li Zi Yue had left the Ye clan base, but they did not know why Li Zi Yue had left the base. ”

“When Qiu di said this, everyone’s expressions changed again and again. ”

“Li Zi Yue turned his head to look at the six clan leaders by the side and continued, “Six clan leaders, tell me, who exactly betrayed Miss Ye?” ”

Inexplicably.

The six clan leaders were a little flustered.

Especially when there was a person standing on his face who had a similar figure and temperament to Ye Zhuo.

“”The person who betrayed Miss Ye is you!”The sixth clan leader tried his best to calm his emotions, then, he said, “Li Zi Yue, Miss ye treated you quite well when she was alive! Why did you betray her? The heavens are watching. Let me tell you, sooner or later, you will get your retribution!” ”

“Speaking up to this point, the sixth clan leader seemed to have thought of something and opened his mouth, “Oh! I understand now. This fake was created by you! Li Zi Yue, when Miss Ye was around, you were already ambitious and wholeheartedly wanted to replace Miss Ye’s position. Not long after Miss Ye left, you left the Ye clan base and betrayed Miss Ye! You must have been waiting for this day! You want this marionette to replace Miss Ye? Let me tell you! “As long as there are people like us, no one can think of replacing Miss Ye! “Although Miss Ye is no longer here, she will forever live in our hearts!” ”

The sixth Patriarch’s words could be considered to have resonated with everyone.

Ye Zhuo was indeed ye Zhuo.

“”Sixth Patriarch is right! Although Miss Ye is no longer here, Miss Ye will forever live in our hearts! Not just anyone can casually replace Miss Ye!” ”

“”Li Zi Yue, get lost!” ”

“Seeing everyone’s reaction, the sixth patriarch’s heart calmed down quite a bit. ”

Right.

Just like that.

“Li Zi Yue turned around and faced everyone. He gently raised his hands and continued, “Everyone, please listen to me. Six months ago, Miss Ye did indeed have an accident during an experiment and died on the spot...” ”

“Hearing the words ‘died on the spot’, the corners of autumn flute’s lips curled up without a trace. ”

She knew it.

A dead person was a dead person.

A dead person still wanted to fight with a living person?

Ridiculous.

“Li Ziyue paused for a moment, then changed the topic, he continued, “Although Miss Ye died on the spot, fortunately, she was only in a state of suspended animation. In order to investigate the truth behind this accident, Miss ye pretended to be real and hid until now. Until today, all the foxes have revealed their tails ”

“”First of all, Miss Ye has nothing to do with Qiu Di. Back then, Miss Ye did not have the experience of staying in the Qiu family as a servant, nor did Qiu di Owe Miss Ye a favor. Everything was a lie by Qiu Di, the Great Witch Doctor, and the Six clan leaders! “And Miss Ye’s accident was also caused by them! “Their goal was to seize power and usurp the throne, covering the sky with one hand in changyue!” ” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“As soon as these words were said, chaos instantly broke out in the audience. ”

Everyone was discussing animatedly.

Especially the seven clan leaders.

“”This, this, this, how is this possible! How can sixth brother be a traitor! It Can’t be!” ”
