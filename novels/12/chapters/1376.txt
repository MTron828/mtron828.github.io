“Hearing this, Zhou Xiang was stunned for a moment before her face turned completely cold. “Jinbei, what nonsense are you spouting! That’s Our Dad! Even if you don’t like him, you can’t accuse him like that!” ”

“When Wu Lan left, Zhou Xiang was thirteen years old. Girls tended to remember things late. She vaguely remembered that Wu Lan and Zhou Zuolong had a very good relationship. ”

“Every year on Wu Lan’s birthday, Zhou Zuolong would prepare a surprise for Wu Lan. ”

“Moreover, when Wu Lan had an accident and left, Zhou Zuolong cried so hard that he almost fainted. ”

“If Wu Lan’s death really had something to do with Zhou Zuolong, Zhou Zuolong would not cry so hard. ”

“One day, husband and wife, one hundred days of grace. ”

Wu Lan and Zhou Zuolong had been husband and wife for more than ten years. The two of them were also freely in love. Zhou Xiang did not believe that Zhou Zuolong would do anything to let Wu Lan Down.

“Zhou Jinbei had long expected this reaction from Zhou Xiang. He continued, “Sister, mom just left, and Zhou Zuolong immediately let Xie wanqiu step into the house. Don’t you find it strange at all?” ”

“If Zhou Zuolong really loved Wu Lan that much, he would have to wait at least a year and a half, let alone three years of filial piety. ”

But what about Zhou Zuolong?

Wu Lan had just passed the 70th hour when he returned with Xie Wanqiu.

“Moreover, in Zhou Jinbei’s memories, Zhou Zuolong was not too sad after Wu Lan left. ”

“After saying that, Zhou Jinbei raised his head to look at Zhou Xiang and asked very seriously, “Sis, do you really believe that our mother is such a promiscuous woman?” ”

“In any case, he did not believe it. ”

“Therefore, all these years, Zhou Jinbei had been looking for an opportunity. ”

“Even though his mother, Wu Lan, had left for so many years, Zhou Jinbei still wanted to clear Wu Lan’s name. ”

“Zhou Xiang’s expression was unclear. “Jinbei, I understand how you feel, but it’s already happened. Our mother has been gone for so many years. Just accept reality.” ”

“As her daughter, Zhou Xiang did not want to believe that her mother was that kind of woman. ”

But the truth was right before her eyes. So what if she did not believe it?

She could only deceive herself.

Accept reality...

“When he heard this, Zhou Jinbei’s face was full of self-mockery. ”

He didn’t expect Zhou Xiang to say this.

“”Sis,”Zhou Jinbei drank a mouthful of water. “Since Zhou Zuolong said that mom has another man outside, why hasn’t he announced who that man is?” ”

“Zhou xiang said, “The deceased is already dead. Didn’t Dad say that? He doesn’t want to be calculative with the deceased.” ”

Zhou Jinbei sneered. “You don’t know Zhou Zuolong at all.”

“As his son, Zhou Jinbei knew Zhou Zuolong too well. Selfish, greedy, vain... ” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“If Wu Lan really did something to let Zhou Jinbei down, Zhou Jinbei would be so calm. ”

He would definitely make it known to everyone.

“”The reason why he didn’t announce who that man was was because this matter was made up!”Zhou jinbei continued, “Zhou Zuolong is smearing our mother’s name!” ”

Zhou Xiang frowned.

Xie wanqiu and Zhou Zuolong were a half-way married couple. Zhou Zuolong could treat her so well and never abandon her. Xie Wanqiu was the one who made the decisions for the Zhou family.

Wu Lan and Zhou Zuolong were still the original couple.

Would Zhou Zuolong do something to smear Wu Lan?

“Could it be that in Zhou Zuolong’s heart, his first love was not as good as Xie Wanqiu? ”

Zhou Xiang had photos of Wu Lan when she was young.

Wu Lan was very beautiful and had an excellent temperament. Xie wanqiu could not be compared to Wu Lan.

Zhou Jinbei had no reason to do so.

“In Zhou Xiang’s heart, if Zhou Zuolong could treat Xie wanqiu so well, then he would definitely treat Wu Lan better. ”

“”That won’t happen,”Zhou Xiang continued, “Jinbei, there are some things that can not be said carelessly. Father and mother are in free love. Father will not do anything to let mother down.” ”

“”SIS, why don’t You Believe Me?”Zhou Jinbei was a little anxious. ”

Zhou Xiang’s personality was also unknown. She was very gentle and soft.

“Otherwise, she wouldn’t have let Zhou Zuolong and Xie wanqiu bully her for so many years. ”

“Zhou Xiang stirred the coffee in her cup. “Jinbei, it’s not that I don’t believe you. It’s just that your opinion is simply unconvincing.” ”

“At this point, Zhou Xiang sighed, “I know that you’ve always minded Xie wanqiu, but it’s been so many years. Just let go of what needs to be put down. Life is like a white horse passing by, but in the blink of an eye, why do you have to do this? If you keep thinking about those things in the past, not only do you feel bad, others also feel bad! One must learn to move on.” ”

Zhou Xiang was very open-minded.

“Although she and Zhou Xiang were siblings, their personalities were completely different. ”

“Zhou Jinbei had grown up early and had hidden his thoughts well. When he left home at the age of 16, he only took one identity card with him. ”
