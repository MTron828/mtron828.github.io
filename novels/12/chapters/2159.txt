“Anyway, she didn’t see anything wrong with full stars. ”

Could it be that old Mrs. Cen had keen eyes?

Old Mrs. Cen picked up a small bead from the ground. “Look at this.”

“”What is this?”Cen Yueying was puzzled for a moment, then she continued, “Whose bracelet broke?” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “It was the culprit that almost made me fall.” ”

“This is Manxing’s?”Cen Yueying asked.

“Old Mrs. Cen smiled and said, “You finally got it!” ”

“From the moment Manxing had supported Old Mrs. Cen in time, Old Mrs. Cen knew that things were definitely not simple. ”

“Sure enough, Manxing’s next move was to deliberately curry favor with her. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen was so old, she had seen everyone. ”

“No matter how good Manxing’s disguise was, she could tell at a glance. ”

“CEN yueying took the bead. “Oh my God, this is too scary! I looked at her peaceful appearance and thought she was a good girl! I was almost fooled!” ”

“”So, you should be more careful in the future! Don’t be fooled!”Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Let’s Get Ready, the banquet is about to begin.” ”

“Okay.”

The auspicious time that was set soon began.

“Cen Haifeng stood on the stage and formally introduced Old Mrs. Cen, Zhou Xiang, and the three CEN sisters, followed by Cen Shaoqing and Ye Zao. ”

“When Cen Haifeng introduced ye Zao as Cen Shaoqing’s fiancée, the atmosphere below the stage suddenly became quiet. ”

It was even a little strange.

Fiancée?

What qualifications did ye Zao have to become the eastern fence young master’s fiancée?

Wasn’t she just an Earthling?

“In contrast to everyone’s angry faces and gnashing of teeth, Manxing was not angry at all. She sat on the chair and gently shook the fan in her hand. ”

It had to be said that this ye Zao really looked like ye Zao.

“Duanmu Fengyu looked at ye Zao’s figure on the stage, her eyes filled with jealousy. ”

Just wait.

“Soon, ye Zao would lose his balance. ”

“Duanmu Feng and the others prayed in their hearts, praying that Ye Han and the others would come quickly. ”

“Seeing that the family recognition banquet was about to end, Ye Han and the others still hadn’t come. ”

Could it be that they weren’t coming?

“Duanmu Feng and the others gulped, feeling somewhat anxious. If Ye Han and the others didn’t come, then what would she become? ”

A joke?

No.

They would definitely come.

“After all, Suiyue and the others had sent their congratulatory gifts. ”

Duanmu Feng and the others tried their best to calm themselves down.

They couldn’t be anxious.

“At this time, she had to be extremely calm. ”

“At this moment, the door to the entrance was pushed open, and the sound of footsteps could be heard. ”

“It’s Chief Ye!”

Exclamations could be heard from the crowd.

“And chief Leo!”

“Evil doctor!”

“Oh my God! The JY team is really here!”

“Is that someone from the eight great clans?”

“Why is Mr. Feng here as well?”

“Hearing these voices, Duanmu Feng and the anxiety in their hearts finally disappeared. When they looked back, they saw that with Ye Han, Leo, and the others as the leaders, they were indeed here. ”

Great!

“At this moment, Duanmu Feng’s heart was beating extremely fast. ”

“Duanmu Feng lifted the hem of her dress, and the corners of her mouth curled up into a beautiful arc as she walked forward step by step to welcome them. ”

“After all, these people had come for her. ”

“As the host, she naturally had to do her part as a host. ”

“Duanmu Feng and her best posture walked onto the red carpet until she walked in front of Ye Han. “Chief Ye, thank you for being able to…” ”Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Before Duanmu Feng and her words could finish, ye Han acted as if he did not see her. He directly ignored duanmu Feng and walked toward the stage. ”

“At this moment, Duanmu Feng and Ye Han were stunned. ”

The curve on their faces froze at the corners of their mouths.

How could ye Han and Ye Han ignore her?

Could it be that ye Han wanted to make ye Zao embarrassed?

Yes

That must be the case.

Duanmu Feng and Ye Han took a deep breath and tried not to lose their composure. They turned their heads to look at Ye Zao on the stage.

Just wait.

Ye Zao would die very miserably soon.

“According to Leo’s personality, he would probably beat ye Zao until ye Zao didn’t even recognize his mother, right? ”

“As expected, Leo directly rushed over. ”

Duanmu Feng and the corner of their lips curled up.

“But in the next second, Duanmu Feng and the others were dumbfounded. ”

“Leo shouted in surprise, “Father Zao! It’s really you!” ”

“Mr. Feng and the others immediately knelt down on one knee. “Miss Ye, Welcome Back!” ”
