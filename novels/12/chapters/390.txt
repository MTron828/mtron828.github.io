Chapter 391: 116: a forceful slap in the face. The secret is exposed. So, Old Lady Cen is Cen Wu Ye’s grandmother! 1”

Translator: 549690339

When Special Assistant Zhou said this.

The air was unusually quiet.

“Especially Li Qiandong. His face alternated between green and white, and he was somewhat embarrassed. ”

How could he be stupid?

It was clearly Cen Shaoqing who had a misunderstanding about Mu Yourong.

“If that racer wasn’t Mu Yourong, who else could it be? ”

“Mu Yourong’s hand, which was stirring the coffee, also paused. ”

Her face was slightly pale.

Special Assistant Zhou was Cen Fifth Master’s man.

But didn’t Cen fifth master like her?

Then what did CEN Fifth Master Mean Now?

Mu Yourong subconsciously tightened her grip on the silver spoon.

“Li Qiandong raised his head to look at Special Assistant Zhou and tried his best to suppress the anger in his heart. “You said fifth brother asked you to bring the video over, then bring the video over for us to see!” ”

He really wanted to see who would dare to impersonate mu yourong!

It was really too detestable!

“He ziteng echoed, “Words have no proof. Qiandong is right. Special Assistant Zhou, quickly bring out the video and let us see it.” ”

He Ziteng had known Li Qiandong for many years.

“Although Li Qiandong was usually a bit of a playboy, he should not be so easily deceived. ” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Moreover, he didn’t think that Mu Yourong was the type of person who would deceive others. ”

At this moment.

Mu Yourong was a little flustered.

Who could the person in the video be?

“Previously, she had clearly bribed the driving school. The driving school had promised her that the surveillance footage would not be leaked and that they would destroy the video in front of her. ”

This was also the reason why she was so confident that the person driving the car was her.

Because no one would be able to find out who the person driving the car was.

“But now, Cen Wuye had actually found out about the video! ”

… or could it be that the person in the video was also her?

“After all, with the help of the system, she had also demonstrated some driving skills in the driving school. ”

“Or perhaps, there was no video at all. ”

Cen Wuye might have been testing her.

“Thinking of this, Mu Yourong heaved a sigh of relief. She raised her head to look at Special Assistant Zhou. “Special Assistant Zhou, everything depends on evidence. I also want to see who the person pretending to be me is!” ”

Special Assistant Zhou nodded. He turned on his tablet computer and clicked on a video.

This was the surveillance camera in the coach’s car.

“At first, it was the coach’s disdainful voice. “You don’t know how to fail? Come! I’ll give you the steering wheel. Drive one for us to see! Xiao Liu, get out of the car first.” ”

The image gradually became clear —

The girl sitting in the driver’s seat slightly tilted her head and looked at the coach in the passenger seat. “Are You Ready?”

This was a face so perfect that it made people sigh.

Her eyebrows were as clear as a painting.

Her skin was as white as snow.

Her red lips were naturally red without being touched.

Her cold breath carried a third of coldness.

“At first, he ziteng thought that Mu Yourong was very beautiful, but in front of this person, Mu Yourong instantly disappeared without a trace. ”

The surveillance video continued.

“The coach glanced at her and reminded her, “Drive, I’ll tell you again. This is the accelerator, this is the brake! Don’t step on the wrong car!” ”

“As soon as she said this, the car rushed out. ”

It sped up on the S-bend.

“It was clearly a coach car with very low equipment, but she drove it like a professional sports car. ”

“Under her control, the coach continuously changed all kinds of high-difficulty movements. ”

Drift!

Jump and slide!

The coaches on the side were all scared silly.

They were dumbstruck.

“All the doubts, disdain, all turned into affirmation at this moment. ”

Seeing this.

Mu Yourong’s back broke out in layers of cold sweat.

How could this be?

Where did this video come from?

She had clearly asked someone to destroy the video.

What on Earth was going on?

“Mu Yourong couldn’t sit still, but she had to pretend to be very calm. ”

She couldn’t panic.

She couldn’t panic now.

She believed that Li Qiandong would definitely stand on her side.

“He ziteng was a professional racer. With this video, he could tell at a glance that the young woman in the video was the person he was looking for! ”

He ziteng stood up excitedly. “It’s her! Special Assistant Zhou! The person I’m looking for is her!”

“Li Qiandong frowned and looked at special assistant Zhou. “Special Assistant Zhou, I know that fifth brother admires the great god very much, but he can’t impose the glory that should belong to miss mu on the great god just because he admires him!” ”

“In Li Qiandong’s opinion, the person driving the car was Mu Yourong! ”

Cen Shaoqing worshipped ye Zao too much.

“Therefore, Ye Zao was omnipotent in his eyes. ”

“No matter what good things happened, he wanted to impose them on ye Zao. ”

But this was simply too unfair to Mu Yourong.

“No matter what, Mu Yourong was once Cen Shaoqing’s fiancée. How could Cen Shaoqing not care about the slightest bit of old feelings? ”

“After saying this, Li Qiandong turned to look at he ziteng, “Ziteng! Don’t be fooled by this fake video! This video was definitely post-made! The person driving the car was yourong! Fifth Brother did this because he had a slight misunderstanding of yourong! I can guarantee with my personality that the person driving the car is definitely yourong!” ”
