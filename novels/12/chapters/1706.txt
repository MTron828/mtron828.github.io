“Ye Shu smiled and said, “This also proves that De Ning and Chu Jie are fated to be together. Coincidences don’t make a book.” ”

It wasn’t like a family didn’t enter the same house. Ye Shu felt that the two of them might really succeed!

“Chu Jie echoed, “Aunty Shu is right.” ”

“Hearing this, Ye Shu roughly understood what Chu Jie meant. ”

Chu Jie had a good impression of Gu De Ning.

Now it was up to Gu De Ning.

“Ye Sen felt like he could hardly breathe. Why did he reject the blind date? Was he stupid? If he had not rejected it, the person fated to be with Gu De Ning would be him now! ”

And Ye Shu.

Ye Shu was still his sister!

How could he turn his back on others.

He saw that Chu Jie and Gu Dening did not match at all.

“Unfortunately, Ye Sen was in a difficult situation right now. ”

“Ye Shu continued, “Have you discussed the cooperation with the client?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Sen nodded.

“Then aren’t you busy right now?”Ye Shu continued to ask.

“”Not very busy.”Ye Sen sat down. “Dening, Chu Jie, do you guys mind if I Sit Down and have a cup of coffee too?” ”

“Ye Shu looked at Ye Sen speechlessly. The two of them were on a blind date, so why was Ye Sen following them? ”

“Gu De Ning smiled and said, “I don’t mind.” ”

“Chu Jie asked, “What does uncle ye want to drink?” ”

“Blue Mountain Coffee.”

“Seeing that Ye Sen was really going to sit down, ye Shu lowered his voice and said, “Ye Sen, what are you doing? The young man is on a blind date, and you’re acting as a third wheel here?” ”

“”I’m drinking coffee,”ye Sen said matter-of-factly. ”

“Is it time for you to drink coffee now?”Ye Shu asked back. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Ye Sen said, “Sister, they’re not a match at all. Don’t just randomly pick a couple! Hurry up and let the two go back to their respective homes to find their own mothers!” ”

“”You’re still a single dog, what do you know about being a match!”Ye Shu said, “I think these two are a match made in heaven. Also, I think Chu Jie has a good impression of De Ning. If De Ning also has a good impression of Chu Jie, wouldn’t this matter be settled?” ”

Ye Sen felt like he couldn’t breathe.

“”SIS, I...” ”

“”What do you mean you! Shut Up!”Ye Shu frowned. “De Ning is such a good girl. You Don’t like her! You Don’t like her, there are people who don’t like her!” ”

Ye Shu liked gu de Ning very much.

“The little girl was good-looking, had a good personality, had a high education, and was a doctor. She really liked her no matter how she looked at her. ”

“Unfortunately, he was not fated to be with Ye Sen. ”

If Only Ye Sen was sitting here on a blind date with Gu dening today.

“”When, when did I not like her? ! Sister, don’t talk nonsense!”Ye Sen was so anxious that his face turned white. ”

“Ye Shu was too lazy to talk to him. “Okay, okay, you should go back now.” ”

“I’m not leaving.”Ye Sen sat up straight.

“Just then, the waiter came over with some good coffee. “Sir, Here’s Your Blue Mountain.” ”

“Thank you.”Ye Sen took the coffee with a smile.

“While drinking the coffee, he saw gu dening sitting opposite him whispering to Chu Jie. ”

What were the two talking about?

“Unfortunately, their voices were too low for ye Sen to hear. ”

But it seemed that they were chatting happily.

Because gu dening still had a faint smile on her lips.

“Ye Sen took a sip of the coffee and suppressed the sour feeling in his heart. He looked up at Chu Jie and said with a smile, “How is Little Chu doing recently? Are you busy?” ”

Chu Jie looked up slightly. “Not busy.”

“Ye Sen nodded and continued, “I remember that you found a girlfriend before. Why did you break up so quickly?” ”

“Asking such a question in front of a blind date, Ye Sen was obviously causing trouble! ”

“However, Chu Jie was not nervous and continued, “That was two years ago. Uncle Ye, you have a good memory.” ”

“It’s been two years already?”Ye Sen scratched his head. “I thought it was only recently!”

“At this moment, ye Shu kicked ye Sen. “Ye Sen, I remember that you still have something to do in a while, right? Then go do your work!” ”

“”It’s nothing! Sister, you must have remembered wrongly, right?”Ye Sen said. ”

“Ye Shu rolled her eyes at him and continued, “De Ning, then you should have a good chat with Chu Jie. I’ll leave with Ye Sen first.” ”

“After saying that, Ye Shu pulled ye Sen’s hand and stood up. “Let’s Go First!” ”

“Before ye Sen could react, he was pulled out of the cafe by Ye Shu. ”

“”Sister, what are you doing?”Ye Sen said with some dissatisfaction, “I haven’t even finished my coffee!” ”

“”What am I doing? I wanted to ask you what are you doing!”Ye Shu frowned, “They are going on a blind date, and you are sitting here. Are you trying to stir up trouble? What if they fall apart under your influence? It’s better to destroy a temple than destroy a marriage!” ”
