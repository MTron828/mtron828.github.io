“Speaking of which, it was indeed miraculous. The white pill actually melted in water and soon, there was no trace of it at all!”

“After finishing everything, Zhang Qingqing stood up calmly and returned to her seat with a cocktail in her hand. She smiled and said, “Let’s play the wheel of fortune. Whoever loses will drink!””

“Okay!”The few of them agreed.

Zhang Qingqing picked up an empty bottle. “Whoever faces the bottle will lose!”

“”Okay, no problem!””

“Zhang Qingqing placed the bottle on the table and spun it around. A few seconds later, the bottle was aimed at Li Wen.”

“Seeing that she was about to drink, Li Wen said, “This round doesn’t count. Brother Ze isn’t here yet. Let’s wait for Brother Ze!””

“Fat tiger asked curiously, “Where did brother Ze Go?””

“Dog two added, “I think he went to the bathroom.””

“As they were talking, Lin Ze came over.”

“Fat Tiger stood up and said, “Brother Ze, let’s play the wheel of fortune. If we lose, we have to drink. We’ll punish ourselves with three glasses!””

“Three glasses is too ruthless!”Ouyang Qian said.

“”It’s fine.”Fat tiger continued, “There’s a room here. If you’re really drunk, you can go to the room to rest.”” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Alright!”Ouyang Qian nodded.

“Since they were all on the same side today, Ouyang Qian didn’t have to worry about being taken advantage of.”

“Coincidentally, Lin Ze lost the first round of the wheel of fortune. The bottle was facing him.”

“Li Wen was overjoyed. He smiled and said, “Brother Ze, drink!””

“Lin Ze picked up the cup in front of him and downed it in one gulp. Then, he poured two more cups.”

“Seeing Lin ze finish all the wine in the cup, Zhang Qingqing narrowed her eyes.”

The loser of the second round was Hua Xian.

“After a few rounds, except for Zhang Qingqing, everyone else was drunk.”

“Especially Lin Ze, he felt as if his head was about to explode.”

It was very uncomfortable!

“Lin Ze pinched his temples and tried hard to calm himself down. Then, he walked to the washbasin in the bathroom and washed his face. He thought that he would wake up a little with cold water, but his head was still very dizzy, lin Ze looked at himself in the mirror and wiped the water off his face. Then, he stumbled out and walked to dog two’s side. “I’m going in to rest.””

“Dog two laughed and said, “No way, brother Ze! That’s all you can drink! You Can’t even hold your liquor?””

“My Head Hurts!”Lin Ze didn’t say anything else and turned to leave.

“Looking at Lin Ze’s back, Zhang Qingqing narrowed her eyes. It seemed that Lin Ze’s drug effect had taken effect.”

“”Qingqing, what are you looking at!”Ouyang Qian put her hand on Zhang Qingqing’s shoulder. “Come, drink!””

“”Okay, drink!”Zhang Qingqing picked up her glass and drank half a glass of wine perfunctorily. Her thoughts had already drifted to Lin Ze.”

She had to think of a way to get all these people drunk!

“Actually, there weren’t many people left.”

“An Lizi and Hua Xian were already extremely dizzy. They supported each other and said, “Let’s go to the room to rest too.””

“Ouyang Qian said drunkenly, “Your alcohol tolerance is too low!””

“After saying that, Ouyang Qian also fainted on the table.”

“An lizi smiled and said, “You still have the nerve to talk about us! Aren’t you the same?””

“Hua Xian rubbed his head and said, “Don’t bother about her. Let’s go to the room.””

“Okay.”An Lizi nodded.

“In the blink of an eye, only Li Wen and fat tiger were left in the hall, as well as Ouyang Qian, who was sleeping soundly on the table.”

Zhang Qingqing poured herself a glass of orange juice. Her biggest problem now was Li Wen and fat tiger.

These two people seemed to not be able to get drunk.

No.

This couldn’t go on. The sky was about to light up!

She had to think of a way.

“Zhang Qingqing narrowed her eyes and changed to another glass. She poured a full glass and said with a smile, “Li Wen, fat tiger, let me toast to you! This birthday is probably the most special birthday I’ve ever had! Thank you!””

“You’re welcome.”Li Wen and fat tiger raised their glasses.

Zhang Qingqing finished the beer in the glass in one gulp. Li Wen and fat tiger also finished the beer in the glass.

“Zhang Qingqing continued, “I’m a girl and I’m drinking with you. How can you have the nerve to drink beer when I’m drinking beer?””

“What do you drink if you don’t drink beer?”Fat Tiger asked.

“”I drink beer, you drink white.”Zhang Qingqing took out a bottle of white wine.”

“That won’t do. It’s too unfair. We’ve long advocated equality between men and women!”Said Fat Tiger.

“Zhang Qingqing smiled and said, “That’s true. Then I’ll drink white wine too. Now it’s just the three of US left. Why don’t the three of us play a drinking game? Let’s see who gets drunk First!””

“Fat Tiger’s interest was immediately piqued. He rolled up his sleeves and said, “Sure! In terms of drinking games, I’ve never lost!””
