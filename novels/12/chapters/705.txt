“Chapter 706: 159: a big drama, face-slapping song Chenyu! 1”

Translator: 549690339

Xi Weiyue was the person who looked like little half moon the most in the entire XI family.

“Because he wanted ye Langhua to think that Xi Weiyue was little half moon who had gone missing, Xi Muwen had specially named his and Yang Jiao’s daughter Weiyue when he was naming her. ”

Weiyue and half moon were only one word apart.

Reality proved that.

Ye Langhua really treated XI weiyue pretty well.

“Ye Langhua did not speak much in the Xi family, and he never took the initiative to communicate with anyone except XI Weiyue. ”

“Many times, ye Langhua would even take the initiative to talk to XI Weiyue about half moon. ”

“Therefore, it was most suitable for XI Weiyue to knock on the door. ”

“Xi Weiyue adjusted her mood, smiled, and walked up to knock on the door. “Auntie.” ”

“Inside, Ye Langhua heard the knock on the door, wiped his tears, and tried his best to control the sadness in his heart. “Who is it?” ”

“Xi Weiyue’s voice came from outside. “Auntie, it’s Weiyue.” ”

“Ye langhua continued, “Weiyue, what’s the matter?” ”

“XI weiyue continued, “Auntie, it’s the New Year today. My parents asked me to keep you company.” ”

“There’s no need.”Ye Langhua put the clothes in his arms back under the pillow. “You can go back. I’ll be fine by myself.”

Go Back?

Ye Langhua actually asked her to go back?

“When she heard this, Xi Weiyue’s face revealed a hint of surprise. ”

“To be fair, she really treated ye Langhua very well. ”

“Whenever it was a new year or a festival, she would forget no one and would never forget ye Langhua. She would even buy gifts for ye Langhua. She treated ye Langhua even better than her biological mother, Yang Jiao. ”

But what about ye Langhua?

How did ye Langhua treat her?

Ye Langhua did not treat her as her biological daughter at all. She had kept a secret for almost half her life and had not said a single word to her.

She really had no conscience at all.

Treating her well was better than treating a dog! Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Treating a dog well, the dog even knew how to wag its tail at people. ”

What would ye Langhua Do?

Ye Langhua only knew how to think about that biological daughter all day long.

It had been thirty-six years.

She turned a blind eye to the person who was truly filial to her.

“Xi Weiyue bit her lip, but because of that secret, she still maintained a smiling face, she said gently, “Aunt, I know you miss sister again, so please let me come in and accompany you! I’ve been close to you since we were young. On days like this, if I don’t accompany you, I won’t be at ease either!” ”

“”There’s really no need. I’m fine.”Ye Langhua was not in the mood to see Xi Weiyue now. Seeing XI Weiyue’s face only made her miss her biological daughter even more. “Weiyue, go back and keep your parents company.” ”

Xi Weiyue glanced at XI Muwen and Yang Jiao.

Xi Muwen and Yang Jiao looked at each other and saw the confusion in each other’s eyes.

Not opening the door?

Neither of them had expected ye Langhua to reject XI Weiyue.

This seemed a little abnormal.

“Auntie...”Xi Weiyue still did not want to give up. “Just open the door and let me come in and talk to you for a while. It’s not right for you to keep all your unhappiness bottled up in your heart...”

“In the past, she had accompanied ye Langhua every New Year’s Eve. ”

She did not know what was going on this year.

Could it be that ye Langhua’s time was coming?

Xi Weiyue’s heart was filled with countless thoughts.

“Inside, Ye Langhua did not speak anymore. ”

“Aunt.”Xi Weiyue continued to knock on the door.

Ye Langhua still did not speak.

Only the sound of Xi Weiyue knocking on the door could be heard in the air.

“Xi Muwen waved his hand and said in a low voice, “Forget it, let’s go back first.” ”

“Xi Weiyue nodded. “Aunty, if you’re really unwilling to open the door, then I’ll go back first.” ”

There was still no reply from inside.

“Xi Weiyue looked inside the room and saw that ye Langhua still had no intention of opening the door, so she followed Xi Muwen’s footsteps. ”

The family of three was walking on the road.

“XI weiyue said, “Dad, what do you think Aunty is doing this year?” ”

Xi Muwen also frowned.

It had to be said that this year’s ye Langhua was indeed a little abnormal.

“He had been married to ye Langhua for 40 years, so he knew ye Langhua very well. ”

“Ever since ye Langhua had gone missing half a month ago, she seemed to have changed. ”

“In the past, ye Langhua only had heart-to-heart contact with XI Weiyue. ”

“Now, ye Langhua even ignored XI weiyue. ”

This made Xi Muwen a little worried.

He was worried that things would change.

“Yang Jiao looked at the two of them. “Aren’t the two of you not anxious? Last time when I urged you two, you said to be patient. If you’re anxious, you can’t eat hot tofu. Now you finally know how to be anxious, right? !” ”

“Xi Muwen extinguished the cigar in his hand. His face was full of worry. “At a time like this, you should stop making sarcastic remarks! At that time, she wasn’t willing to say, so what’s the use of US panicking?” ”
