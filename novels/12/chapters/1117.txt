“I’ll take this one.”Ye Zao preferred black.

Amy was stunned.

She hadn’t expected ye Zao to choose this Black Starry Night Gown.

“Although ye Zao was very beautiful, she was too young. ”

“She was too young, and her temperament couldn’t keep up. She couldn’t use this black starry night gown at all. It might be self-defeating. ”

“According to her years of experience as a costume designer, Ye Zhuo was more suitable for the white dress. ”

Choosing the white dress would bring out the advantages of Ye Zhuo.

“With the idea of being responsible for her job, Amy reminded her, “Compared to black, I still think white suits you better. This white design can bring out your temperament better.” ”

“”Thank you, but I prefer the black dress.”Perhaps it had something to do with her job, but ye Zhuo really liked the starry night. ”

“Especially when she was traveling in a spaceship, she could sit in the cockpit and watch for an hour without moving. ”

“Therefore, as soon as she came in, her eyes were attracted by the black dress. ”

“Hearing this, Amy frowned without a trace. Anyway, she had already reminded ye Zao that he didn’t believe her. No matter how much she said, Ye Zao wouldn’t listen to her. Amy didn’t say anything more, picked up the black gift and handed it to Ye Zao, she smiled and said, “Miss Ye, come in with me.” ”

“Ye Zao said, “I’ll go in and change myself.” ”

She didn’t like having a second person there when she was changing or taking a shower.

“Amy explained, “It might be inconvenient for one person to wear this gown.” ”

“”It’s okay,”ye Zao said. “I can do it myself.” ”

“Amy nodded and handed the dress to Ye Zao. “If you run into any trouble during the fitting, just let me know.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

Ye Zao went in to change.

Amy stood outside the door.

“Just then, her phone rang. ”

“Amy picked up the phone. It was a message from her colleague, Annie. ”

[ which dress did Miss ye choose? ]

Amy replied: [ the black one. ]

“Seeing Amy’s reply, Annie sent a voice message. “Black? The black one isn’t easy to control, is it?” ”

“Afraid that ye Zhuo might hear something, Amy didn’t send a voice message. She continued to edit the text. [ I don’t think she can control it either, but she won’t listen to me. What can I Do? ] ”

“”Anyway, you’ve already reminded her. If she insists on wearing that dress, then it’s her own problem!” ”

“After chatting with Amy, Annie knocked on the door of the fitting room. “Miss Zhao.” ”

“What’s Wrong?”Zhao Xueyin asked.

“Annie continued, “Amy replied that she wants Miss ye to choose the black starry sky dress.” ”

“Black?”Zhao Xueyin narrowed her eyes.

“Yes.”

Zhao Xueyin had seen the black starry sky gown before. Anyone who did not have a certain age and experience would not be able to control it.

Ye Zhuo was going to wear that?

“Zhao Xueyin looked at herself in the mirror. The beauty in the mirror was extremely beautiful. She had a standard oval face, almond eyes, and willow-like eyebrows. Her skin was as white as snow, and she was as beautiful as a flower. ”

“In recent years, the number of people who pursued Zhao Xueyin could be ranked from the financial world to the International Financial Center. ”

Although ye Zao was good-looking.

In terms of experience and temperament.

She really could not compare to herself. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

She was inferior to ye Zao.

“If she wore the same style of dress as ye Zao, would others be able to see ye Zao? ”

The people who came tonight were all powerful people in the financial world. They could take this opportunity to completely crush ye Zao and stomp him under their feet.

A real Phoenix was not something a small sparrow could compare to.

“Zhao xueyin smiled and said, “Annie.” ”

“”I’m here, Miss Zhao.” ”

“Zhao Xueyin continued, “What do you think of me wearing that black starry sky gown?” ”

“”If you were to wear that black starry sky gown, you would definitely surpass Miss Ye by a few streets,”Annie replied. ”

These words were not flattery.

“Zhao Xueyin wanted experience and experience, she wanted temperament and temperament, she wanted face and face. Her age was also there. She was very good in all aspects. If she were to wear the same gown as ye Zao.., the others at the banquet might not be able to see ye Zao! ”

“Hearing this, a glimmer flashed across Zhao Xueyin’s eyes. She turned around and walked out of the changing room. She picked up her phone and made a call. “Hello, is this David?” ”

“I’m in urgent need of the DL family’s black starry sky gown.”

“Not knowing what was said on the other end, Zhao Xueyin continued, “It’s best to bring it over within an hour.” ”

“A moment later, Zhao Xueyin hung up the phone and turned to look at Annie. “Who’s Ye Zao’s Makeup Artist Tonight?” ”
