Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“After leaving the morgue, ye Zao went to the hospital, went through the relevant procedures, and transferred the old lady’s body to the funeral home. ”

The old lady was well aware of the righteousness and had paid a lot for the righteousness of the nation. She could not let the good people suffer so many false charges for nothing.

“When he learned that Feng Ying had been poisoned to death by the old lady, Dr. Cara was very angry! ”

“However, while he was angry, he was also a little shocked. ”

He really did not expect that an old lady from China could actually do such a thing!

“He had thought that Chinese people were naturally rebellious. They were all like professor Feng and director Ma. He did not expect that in the end, he would still underestimate the Chinese people. ”

“Tina was also very surprised. She had already planned to bring Suyu back to China. Who would have thought that at the most crucial step, such a mistake would occur. ”

“”Dr. Cara, I’m sorry. It’s all my fault! Please Punish Me!” ”

“Dr. Cara flicked the ashes on his cigar and continued, “This has nothing to do with you.” ”

“Although Dr. Cara had already said that it had nothing to do with her, Tina was still very guilty. At this moment, Tina seemed to have suddenly thought of something, then, she said, “Oh right, Dr. Cara, someone from the hospital said that YC transferred Feng Shu’s body away.” ”

“YC?”Dr. Cara narrowed his eyes. “Are you sure it’s YC?”

“Tina nodded. “Yes, I’m sure!” ”

“Dr. Cara was very confused. Feng Qi had betrayed the CEN base, and the old lady was Feng Qi’s mother. At this time, how could YC take over the old lady’s Affairs? ”

No!

This matter was strange.

What was Ye Zao’s motive?

Dr. Cara pressed his temples.

“After a while, Dr. Cara asked, “Have you found Suyu?” ”

“”No.”Tina shook her head. “After the Feng family’s accident, our people searched the villa several times, but we couldn’t find Suyu!” ”

“Suyu was dead. If it was alive, it might have gone to another place to hide! ”

But how could dead things escape?

“As long as Suyu was still in the Feng family’s villa, they would definitely find it after a thorough search. ”

“But now, Tina could not find Su Yu. ”

This could only mean one thing.

Su Yu was no longer at the Feng family’s Villa!

“Dr. Cara suddenly looked at the screen and continued, “Go and check if Feng Shujing saw anyone a few days before the accident! Once you have the results, contact me immediately!” ”

“”Okay.”Tina nodded. After hanging up the phone, she immediately sent someone to check. ”

“The old lady did not have any special identity and her itinerary was not hidden. Very quickly, Tina found out that the day before the accident, the old lady went to the CEN base. ”

“However, Tina could not find out who exactly she saw. ”

Tina immediately reported the situation to Dr. Kara.

“Hearing this, Dr. Kara narrowed her eyes. “YC! The last person that Feng Shujing saw was definitely YC!” ”

“If the last person that Feng Shujing met was not ye Zao, Ye Zao would not have gone to deal with Feng Shujing’s funeral for no reason. ”

“You mean YC has taken away the jade!”Tina also reacted quickly.

“Yes.”Dr. Cara nodded. “The jade must be in YC’s hands.”

“Tina said angrily, “YC is too shameless! We wanted to take a fancy to the jade, but she came and interfered!” ”

How could Chinese people be shameless like ye Zao?

“After saying that, Tina continued, “Then, the deaths of Feng Shujing and Feng Ying are definitely related to YC. Dr. Cara, what should we do now?” ”

We can’t just take this lying down!

“Dr. Cara took a puff of his cigar and said, “I’ll handle this matter. You Don’t have to worry about it!” ”

Tina was stunned.

“Dr. Cara continued, “Don’t worry. I have a way to get YC to hand over the plain jade.” ”

“Okay.”

“After hanging up the video call, Dr. Cara immediately went to create public opinion ”

“The internet could make a person, but it could also destroy a person. ”

So what if ye Zao was the mother of the world’s aircraft carriers? There were two lives in front of her!

And they were both poisoned!

“Dr. YC had poisoned two generations of his grandfather and grandson because of the jade passed down from generation to generation. He had even framed an old man. If this news were to spread, it would be enough to ruin ye Zao’s reputation. ”

“Moreover, if he was accused of murder, he would have to pay with his life, not to mention two lives! ”

“Feng Shujing and Feng Qi had both died because of ye Zao. If this matter was exposed by the Internet, would ye Zao Still Be Alive? ”
