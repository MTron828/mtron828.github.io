Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly.

“He ziteng passed a cigarette to Cen Shaoqing. “Fifth brother, this is something I specially got from U country. Have a taste.” ”

Cen Shaoqing waved his hand. “I quit smoking.”

Quit smoking?

He ziteng looked at Cen Shaoqing in disbelief. “Really?”

Cen Shaoqing had smoked for ten years...

How could he quit just like that?

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Why?”He ziteng asked in surprise.

“CEN Shaoqing said, “Because smoking is bad for the lungs.” ”

Just like that?

He ziteng did not believe it.

“Because before this, old madam Cen had told Cen Shaoqing countless times that smoking was bad for the lungs, but Cen Shaoqing still did as he was told. ”

Now...

How could he quit just like that?

There must be something fishy going on.

There must be something behind this!

“Cen Shaoqing did not smoke, so he ziteng also gave up the idea of smoking. He continued, “Fifth brother, when can I meet my idol?” ”

“I’ll ask her.”Cen Shaoqing took out his phone.

“At this moment, he ziteng even thought that he was seeing things. ”

It was a pink phone case.

On top of it was a circle of dazzling diamonds...

In the middle of the diamonds was a pink little pig.

Didn’t little girls like this kind of phone case?

“”Fifth, fifth brother, did you take the wrong phone?”He ziteng was so surprised that he couldn’t even speak properly. ”

“I didn’t.”Cen Shaoqing was so calm as she continued to send messages.

“Your... your phone case...”

“It’s not good-looking?”Cen Shaoqing raised his eyebrows slightly.

“He ziteng clearly saw the fleeting cold light in Cen Shaoqing’s eyes and hurriedly nodded. “It’s good-looking! It’s good-looking! Very good-looking. Fifth Brother, your taste is really good!” ”

“In order to show that he wasn’t lying, he ziteng even gave a thumbs up. ”

The corners of Cen Shaoqing’s mouth curled up slightly.

“Of course, he had good taste. ”

“He ziteng swallowed his throat. If he did not see wrongly, CEN Shaoqing seemed to be smiling? ”

What was he smiling about?

“A moment later, Cen Shaoqing put down his phone and continued, “I just asked for you. She’s free tomorrow.” ”

“That’s Great!”He ziteng’s eyes lit up.

“Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “Tomorrow morning at 10:30 am, on the winding mountain highway, she wants to play with you.” ”

Play with her?

He ziteng’s blood was boiling!

“Really? I can really race with my idol?”

“”Yes.”Cen Shaoqing continued to spin the Buddhist beads. The dark red tassels circled around his fingertips, adding a little flirtatious charm. ”

“”That’s great! That’s really great! Fifth brother, thank you!”He ziteng was very excited. He continued, “Then what time shall we set off tomorrow?” ”

“Come to the office at 9:30 to look for me.”

“Okay.”

...

At the Cen family home.

“Old Mrs. Cen was standing in the garden and making some sounds. With a wave of her pink sleeves, she really felt something. ”

“At this moment, a servant jogged over. “Old Mrs. Cen.” ”

“What’s Wrong?”Old Mrs. Cen turned around and adjusted her sleeves.

“The servant said, “Young master Li is here. He’s waiting for you in the living room.” ”

“Dongzi is here?”Old Mrs. Cen was a little surprised.

“Yes.”The maid nodded.

Old Mrs. Cen rolled up her sleeves and followed the maid into the living room.

“Li Qiandong was sitting on the sofa in the living room. When he saw Old Mrs. Cen enter, he quickly stood up. “Old Madam.” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen smiled and said, “Why is Dongzi free today?” ”

“Li Qiandong said, “Old Mrs. Cen, I came to tell you something about fifth brother.” ”

Zhou Xiang was not in charge.

Cen Haifeng left early.

The only person who could control Cen Shaoqing was old Mrs. Cen.

“Cen Shaoqing did not want to come to cloud capital, but he still came under old Mrs. Cen’s pressure. ”

“So, as long as Old Mrs. Cen nodded and spoke up for Mu Yourong, Cen Shaoqing would definitely agree to marry Mu Yourong. ”

As long as Cen Shaoqing married Mu Yourong.

Then all the difficulties of the MU family would be easily solved!

“As far as he knew, old Madam Cen was a very reasonable elder, and she also especially hoped that Cen Shaoqing could marry and have children as soon as possible. ”

“Mu Yourong was so kind, old madam Cen would definitely like her very much! ”

“The more Li Qiandong thought about it, the more excited he became. ”

Old Madam Cen looked at Li Qiandong. “What do you want to tell me about fifth-shaoqing?”

“Li Qiandong thought about the words in his heart and said, “Old Mrs. Cen, I want to tell you about fifth brother’s major life event!” ” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Hearing this, Old Mrs. Cen was extremely excited, “Isn’t that right, Dongzi! You can see it too! Shaoqing has someone he likes recently! I think they’re about to get married! I don’t want to brag, but if it weren’t for me, a good grandmother from China, that Brat wouldn’t have married such a beautiful wife!” ”
