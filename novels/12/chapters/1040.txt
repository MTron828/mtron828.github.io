“Ye Zao wrote a complicated formula on the paper, “Then strengthen the defense system and build an isolation surface so that the anti-aircraft missiles will bounce back! “At the same time, we also need to install the most advanced supply system! “If they dare to drop the missiles, we will throw a nuclear bomb at them and let them lose more than they gain!” ”

This was exactly what ye Zao had done in his previous life!

“Cen Shaoqing looked up at Ye Zao. “Leader, are you serious?” ”

“Do I look like I’m Joking?”Ye Zao raised his eyebrows and asked.

It really didn’t seem like it.

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “Leader, can you really develop an aircraft carrier?” ” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“”Yes.”In her previous life, Ye Zao had designed countless types of aircraft carriers and spaceships. To her, this was just a small problem of sprinkling water. ”

Cen Shaoqing narrowed his eyes. “Come with me to the base tomorrow.”

The Cen family’s southern region base specialized in developing space products.

“If ye Zhuo could really develop an aircraft carrier, it would be a miracle of an era! ”

“At that time, China would stand out among the 200 countries in the world! ”

Even country C would have to bow their heads in submission.

“”Sure.”Ye Zhuo stood up and looked at Cen Shaoqing. “But do you really trust me that much? What if I’m just bragging? Developing an aircraft carrier is not a joke. If things go wrong, you’ll go bankrupt.” ”

Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads. “Go bankrupt? Not Really.”

“”What if I really go bankrupt?”Ye Zhuo continued, “What I need is the most advanced technology and a huge amount of manpower. Everything now is just talk on paper. If it succeeds, we can talk about it. If it fails, the consequences will be unimaginable!” ”

“Then I’ll accept it.”Cen Shaoqing reached out and wrapped his arm around ye Zhuo’s waist. He brought him to sit on his lap and opened his thin lips. “Who asked you to be my man?”

Ye Zhuo turned to look at him and raised his eyebrows slightly. “Who did you say was your man?”

“”I’m your man,”Cen Shaoqing said very readily. ”

Ye Zhuo curled his lips slightly. He felt a little uncomfortable and adjusted his sitting posture. “That’s more like it.”

“”Hiss...”Cen Shaoqing held her waist and said in a hoarse voice, “Don’t move.” ”

Ye Zhuo frowned slightly. “What did you put in your pocket?”

Cen Shaoqing looked indifferent. “My phone.”

“No Wonder.”Ye Zhuo was about to ask Cen Shaoqing to take the phone out of his pocket when there was a knock on the door.

Ye Zhuo immediately got off Cen Shaoqing and cleared his throat. “Who is it?”

Cen Shaoqing also heaved a sigh of relief.

He was really afraid that ye Zhuo would ask him to take out his phone!

“”Little twelve, it’s me.”Third Cousin’s voice came from outside the door. ”

Ye Zhuo turned to look at little white. “Go Open the door.”

“Little White said, “The battery is dead! Can’t you see that the battery is charging?” ”

Ye Zhuo:”...”

Cen Shaoqing was very observant as he went to open the door.

“Third Cousin’s wife was still holding her newborn second child in her arms. “Little twelve, what are you doing in your room? Why aren’t you opening the door?” ”

“When she looked up, she saw that the person who opened the door was Cen Shaoqing. She was stunned for a moment. “Shaoqing is here too!” ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “Third sister-in-law.”

“Ye Zhuo walked over and asked, “Third sister-in-law, have you been knocking on the door for a long time?” ”

“Third Cousin’s wife thought that ye Zhuo was the only one in the room, so she asked. At this moment, she immediately changed her tone and said, “No, you heard wrong! By the way, Little Twelve, can I trouble you with something?” ”

“”Third sister-in-law, go ahead.” ”

“Third cousin’s wife continued, “Your third brother and I are going out for a while. Our family’s Tao Tao doesn’t like to let the servants take him, so can I trouble you to take Tao Tao for a while?” ”

“Tao Tao was five months old this year. It was the time for him to recognize the students. Other than his parents, he didn’t want anyone else. ”

“Sometimes, he didn’t even want third cousin. ”

“However, it was strange that Tao Tao, who didn’t want anyone else, was so close to ye Zao! ”

“Therefore, third cousin’s wife carried the child and came to look for ye Zao. ”

“Ye Zao smiled and nodded. “Of course. Third cousin, don’t worry. Leave Tao Tao to me.”After saying that, ye Zao stretched out his hand and took Tao Tao from third cousin’s wife’s hand. ”

Tao Tao was overjoyed when he was just hugged by Ye Zao. He cried out randomly.

“Third Cousin’s wife smiled and said, “Look how much this child likes you! Little Twelve, then I’ll have to trouble you. Your third brother and I will be back very soon.” ”

“”It’s Alright, third sister-in-law. You and third brother can go for as long as you want,”ye Zhuo said. ”

“Third Sister-in-law took out the milk bottle and milk powder again. “Little twelve, if Tao Tao gets hungry later, you can make some milk powder for him to drink. There’s no need to make too much, just 20 milliliters will do.” ”
