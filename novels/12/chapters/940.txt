“In the early years, there was even the matter of spraying contraceptives on cucumbers.”

Xia Xiaoman was stunned. “Then what should I do?”

“Ye Zhuo said, “Pay attention to your diet. It’s best to buy some tools that can measure hormones. Once you find vegetables with excessive hormones, don’t eat them.””

“Okay.”Xia Xiaoman nodded.

“Ye Zao continued, “Later, I’ll prescribe a medicine to detoxify you. Keep your mood happy. Who knows when your little brother and little sister will come.””

“Xia Xiaoman smiled. “Zao Zao, thank you.””

“Of course.”

“After they finished talking about Xia Xiaoman, Ye Zao followed her to the front hall.”

An Lizi was hugging brother Meow and kissing him on the left and right. She didn’t even know that ye Zao had come.

“”Lizi,”ye Zao said with a smile.”

“Upon hearing ye Zao’s Voice, an Lizi released brother Meow from her arms and sprinted towards ye Zao. “Big Zao Zao!””

Brother Meow was thrown to the ground and meowed pitifully.

Little White picked brother Meow up from the ground.

...

Time passed very quickly.

“In the blink of an eye, half a month had passed.”

“In order to make Cen Yuyan successfully get pregnant, Zhou Rui worked very hard every night.”

Unfortunately.

Cen Yuyan’s stomach just couldn’t see any movement.

“Logically speaking, after Cen Yuyan took mother Zhou’s medicine, she should be able to get pregnant very quickly.”

“But even after so long, Cen Yuyan’s stomach still didn’t show any reaction.”

What exactly was going on?

Zhou Rui took the time to return to the Zhou family.

“These few days, Zhou Rui had been very busy. He was almost not at home during the day and only returned at night when it was close to midnight.”

“Therefore, Cen Yuyan made a trip to song Chenyu’s place during the day.”

“When he saw Cen Yuyan come over, song chenyu smiled and said, “Why are you the only one here? Where’s Zhou Rui?””

“Cen Yuyan said, “He’s so busy! He can only be seen at night.””

“Fortunately, Zhou Rui was very busy and could only go home at night. However, he cared for CEN Yuyan a lot.”

“Otherwise, CEN Yuyan really couldn’t stand it.”

Busy?

What else could Zhou Rui be busy with?

Busy playing with women?

“A mocking look flashed across song Chenyu’s eyes. Fortunately, Cen Yuyan was stupid enough. If it were anyone else, they wouldn’t be able to hide it.” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Song Chenyu held Cen Yuyan’s hand. “It’s been more than half a month. Is there still no news from your family?”

“Cen Yuyan shook her head. “In any case, I have Zhou Rui to support me now. It doesn’t matter whether they acknowledge me or not.””

Zhou Rui to support?

Zhou Rui’s money was still hers!

“Song Chenyu’s eyes dimmed. It had only been half a month, and Zhou Rui had already taken more than five million from her.”

“If Cen Yuyan did not get pregnant soon, who would be able to bear it?”

No.

They had to resolve the conflict between Cen Yuyan and the Cen family immediately.

Let the Cen family restore Cen Yuyan’s economy.

“Song Chenyu frowned without a trace, he continued, “Although what you said is true, they are your family after all. Even if you marry Zhou Rui in the future, they are still your family. To put it bluntly, if Zhou Rui bullies you in the future, you still have your family to support you!””

Cen Yuyan glanced at song Chenyu. “Zhou Rui won’t bully me.”

“Song Chenyu smiled and said, “Yes, yes, yes! Zhou Rui won’t bully you! Zhou Rui treats you the best!””

“That’s a must.”

“Song Chenyu continued, “Do you want to eat grapes? I just got someone to deliver them this morning. They are fresh, sour, and sweet.””

Cen Yuyan couldn’t help but swallow her throat when she heard the sour and sweet words. “Are they in the fridge? I’ll go get them!”

“I’ll go.”Song Chenyu stood up.

“”No need, I’ll go.”Cen Yuyan continued, “Why are you like Zhou Rui? You Won’t let me do this, but you won’t let me do that? I’m not a child anymore!””

“Song Chenyu smiled and said, “Looks like Zhou Rui is quite considerate.””

“”That’s true.”CEN Yuyan continued, “Chenyu, do you eat grapes? If you do, I’ll bring more.””

“”I’m full,”song Chenyu replied.”

Cen Yuyan was a little puzzled. “What did you eat that made you full?”

Song Chenyu smiled. “The dog food between you and Zhou Rui.”

“Cen Yuyan said somewhat embarrassedly, “Only you know how to make fun of me.””

“I’m just telling the truth. I’m not making fun of you.”

“Cen Yuyan walked out of the kitchen with grapes and sighed. “If it weren’t for Ye Zhuo, you wouldn’t be single until now.””
