“After saying that, Lin Jincheng continued, “Your grandmother has already set the date. I believe that we will get used to it slowly.” ”

“Dad!”Lin Ze closed his eyes in pain.

“Just then, doctor an walked in from outside the door. “CEO Lin, it’s time for treatment.” ”

Lin Jincheng nodded and left with doctor an.

Lin Ze didn’t know how he left the sanatorium.

“Today was the 13th day of the lunar calendar, and there were only five days left until the 18th. ”

The password to the safe wasn’t unlocked.

He didn’t know anything about his mother’s situation.

What could he do in five days?

Could he just accept Feng Qianhua and Feng Xianxian?

No.

“If he accepted Feng Qianhua and her daughter, what would happen to his mother? ”

“Although Old Mrs. Lin had always said that his mother was a promiscuous woman and even had a child with someone else, Lin Ze did not believe her. ”

“Lin Ze walked on the street in a daze, forming a stark contrast with the noisy crowd. ”

...

The Ye family.

Ye Shu had been very busy these days.

“Although she had only been in Beijing for a short month, because the ye family’s private dishes business was really booming, she was already starting to open a third and fourth branch. ”

“Recently, Ye Zhuo had been busy with the management company and the technology website. He had almost forgotten about his second job and quickly logged into his account. ”

“As soon as he logged in, he received a bunch of messages from people. ”

Ye Zhuo opened them one by one and replied.

The last message was from W.

This was sent by W. Ten Days Ago.

W: [ is the God Here? ]

Ye Zhuo slowly replied: [ what’s the matter? ]

“Thinking that W would not reply immediately, Ye Zhuo prepared to take a shower. ”

“Unexpectedly, she had just taken her pajamas when she received W’s reply. ”

“W sent her a web address, [ is there any confidence in cracking this password? ] ”

Ye Zhuo clicked on it and it was the web address of an advanced safe.

“The security system of this kind of safe was very high, and its technology was at least 20 years ahead of the market. The real-name system connected to the police station, and it was not something that any kind of family could use. ”

“Once it was deciphered, they would get into trouble. ”

And Ye Zhuo was most afraid of trouble.

“Ye Zhuo replied: [ sorry, this can not be deciphered. ] ”

“Before her message was sent out, she saw that W had sent another message. ”

“W: [ the owner of this safe is a friend of my cousin. ]. For some reason, his mother’s information was locked inside. He really wanted to find his mother, but if he could not get the information inside, he could not find his mother ”

“Ye Zhuo frowned slightly. [ alright, let’s make an appointment. Let’s meet and talk about it. ] ”

“W thought Z would continue to refuse, but he didn’t expect Z to agree! ”

He quickly replied: [ you decide the time and place. ]

“Ye Zhuo thought for a moment and then replied: [ tomorrow at 1 pm, see you at Jingde Garden? ] ”

Jingde Garden?

Z on the other end of the screen was stunned.

Jingde garden was a place to listen to plays.

Could it be...

That Master Z was an old man who liked to listen to plays?

Who among the young people liked to listen to plays?

“But now, W could not care about that anymore. He quickly replied: [ Okay! I’ll See You Tomorrow! ] ”

[ see you tomorrow. ]

“When he saw that Z would see him tomorrow, W on the other end of the screen was so excited that he almost jumped up. ”

“He and Z had known each other online for a long time, but he had never seen z in person. ”

W clenched his fist and slammed it on the table. “Dafa!”

“After getting excited, W picked up his phone and called his cousin. “Hello, Xiao Shan! Hurry up and contact your friend. Z has agreed to meet us. Tell him to go to Jingdeyuan at one o’clock tomorrow afternoon.” ”

“Xiao Shan on the other end of the phone was also very excited. “Brother, Really?” ”

“”When have I ever lied to You?”W continued, “After hanging up the phone, I’ll tell you in detail on wechat!” ”

“”Okay, brother!” ”

“After hanging up the phone, Xiao Dan immediately opened wechat. ”

“His cousin quickly sent a wechat message, instructing Xiao Dan to dress more seriously tomorrow. After all, Z was very likely to be an old man. What if he saw Xiao Dan dressed inappropriately and refused to help? ”

Xiao Dan touched his ears. “Then should I remove the earring?”

“”Do you even need to say that?”W continued, “Also, you’d better wear long sleeves to cover the tattoo tomorrow!” ”

Older people were more conservative. Most people did not like juniors to scribble on their bodies.

“W continued, “Tell that friend of yours that we’ll arrive 20 minutes earlier tomorrow!” ”

“Okay.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“After chatting with W, Xiao Dan informed Lin Ze of the good news. ”

“At this moment, Lin Ze was walking alone on the street. When he received Xiao Dan’s call, his whole body came alive. “Really? Z really agreed?” ”

Z’s strength in the hacker world was obvious.

“As long as he agreed to help, there was a 90% chance of success. ”

“”Yes, brother Ze. My cousin asked us to go to Jingde Garden twenty minutes earlier tomorrow.” ”

“Okay!”

“The next day at noon, Lin Ze arrived at the agreed location on time. ”

Jingde Garden.

“They booked a small private room on the third floor. A beaded curtain hung in front of the door of the private room. Looking down, one could see two performers standing on the stage. One was holding a lute, and the other was wearing a long robe and holding a paper fan, they were singing along with the melody of the pipa. ”

“Between the sounds of singing, there was a melodious Qin Huai accent. ”

“When Lin Ze arrived, Xiao Dan and W hadn’t arrived yet. ”

“After about 10 minutes, Xiao Dan arrived. “Brother Ze!” ”

Lin Ze turned around and saw Xiao Dan bringing a young man in a plaid shirt into the room with the beaded curtain raised.

“In comparison, this was W. ”

W was about 30 years old and wore a pair of black-rimmed glasses.

“”Brother Ze, let me introduce you. This is my cousin, W. Brother, this is the Lin ze I told you about.” ”

“”Hello, Senior.”Lin Ze politely extended his hand to W. ”

“Hello.”W smiled and held Lin Ze’s hand. “You’re about the same age as Xiao Shan. Just call me brother from Xiao Shan.”

“Big Brother.”

“After the three of them sat down, a waiter dressed in a cheongsam immediately came to deliver tea. ”

W looked at the waiter. “Please serve some snacks that are suitable for older people. Make Them Soft.”

“”Okay, please wait a moment.” ”

“Lin ze asked in puzzlement, “Are there any elders coming later?” ”

“Xiao dan explained, “Z might be older. Can’t you see that I’ve even covered the Azure Dragon Today?” ”

Lin Ze nodded.

“Time passed by. There were only two minutes left before the agreed time, but there was still no sign of Z. Xiao Dan was a little anxious. “Brother, is that Z not coming?” ”

W looked at his watch. “Wait a little longer.”

“As soon as he said that, the beaded curtain was lifted by a fair hand. The beaded curtain collided with each other, producing a crisp jingling sound. ”

The three of them raised their heads to take a look.

They saw a tall figure wearing a black t-shirt and a cap on her head. The wide brim of the cap covered her face that was as clear as a painting. They could only see a part of her chin that was as white as jade.

“Although they lowered their heads slightly and could not see her face clearly, they could still feel the domineering aura from her! ”

It was very cold and very rustling.

... was this Z?
