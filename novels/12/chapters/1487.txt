“What’s Wrong?”Chen Siyan asked.

“Xia Wei continued, “Mr. Song is here. He’s staying in this hotel!” ” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Really?”Chen Siyan said excitedly.

“Xia Wei nodded and continued, “I didn’t expect Mr. Song to be so sullen behind my back.” ”

“Reserved?”Chen Siyan frowned. “What do you mean?”

“Xia Wei smiled and said, “Miss Chen, I just asked. Mr. Song and Liu Kai arrived in C Nation on the afternoon of the 28th. They even chose the same hotel as us! What does this mean? This means that he is thinking about you, but he just doesn’t show it.” ”

“Hearing this, Chen Siyan’s heart beat a little faster. ”

Was That So?

Did she really make song Shiyu worry about her so much?

“After a moment, Chen Siyan calmed down and continued, “You’ve misunderstood. Shiyu isn’t that kind of person.” ”

“Chen Siyan had known song Shiyu for many years, and she knew song Shiyu’s personality very well. ”

“If song Shiyu really liked her, he wouldn’t have waited until now. ”

Moreover.

Song Shiyu’s methods were harsh and forceful. He wouldn’t do something like standing behind someone and silently protecting them.

“Therefore, Xia Wei must have misunderstood. ”

“Xia Wei continued, “Miss Chen, please listen to my analysis.” ”

“Chen Siyan did not say anything, xia Wei continued, “If Mr. Song really did not have that intention, he would not have chosen to stay at the same hotel as you! Also, why did Mr. Song suddenly come to C nation at this time? On a business trip? An inspection? I don’t think Liu Kai is here on a business trip! Recently, C nation has been so chaotic. There have been shootings everywhere. I think Mr. Song must be here because of you! He’s worried about your safety!” ”

“”Is that so?”Although she wasn’t sure if what Xia Wei said was true, Chen Siyan couldn’t help but be secretly happy. ”

She was quite happy.

She was happy that song Shiyu cared about her.

“In the business world, Chen Siyan was a swift and decisive woman. Only when she was facing song Shiyu would she show such a girly expression. Chen Siyan could see all of her expression, she continued, “In fact, from what I see, Miss Chen, you and Mr. Song are a pair from the sky, a pair from the earth! The Chen and song families were close friends. When Mr. Song was in trouble, it was the great-grandfather who saved him. If it weren’t for the great-grandfather, the current Mr. Song wouldn’t exist. The ancients valued life-saving favors, so it was normal for Mr. Song to have you in his heart! I just don’t know when Mr. Song will be able to face his feelings for you... . .” ”

“In the end, Xia Wei sighed and said, “Mr. Song is almost thirty years old this year. Although you are two years younger than him, you have reached the marriageable age after all. If you continue to delay, it won’t work.” ”

“Hearing this, Chen Siyan’s face also flashed with sadness, but soon, the face of the sadness disappeared completely, and then said: “In fact, as long as I accompany him like this is very happy.” ”

“If he was happy, she would be happy. ”

“Sometimes, love was waiting, not having. ”

“Xia Wei said, “Although that’s what you said, the logic is not so reasonable. You’re still young. “Have you ever thought about what you’ll Do When You’re Old? “Don’t you want to have a crystallization of love with Mr. Song? When you’re old, you can enjoy the joy of family.” ”

“”I can’t think that far ahead.”Chen siyan smiled and said, “Let’s go in.” ”

“Who knew which came first, tomorrow or by accident? Chen Siyan only wanted to live a good life in front of her. ”

“Seeing her like this, Xia Wei didn’t say anything more and followed Chen Siyan in. ”

“When they came to the front desk, chen siyan said, “Find out which room your boss is staying in.” ”

“Chen Siyan often stayed in this hotel. The front desk knew that she and song Shiyu were friends, so he respectfully said, “Miss Chen, please wait a moment.” ”

“A moment later, the front desk continued, “Miss Chen, the BOSS is staying in Room C3008.” ”

“”Okay, thank you.” ”

“After thanking her, Chen Siyan was about to go back when she seemed to have thought of something. She continued, “Oh right. Please ask someone to send a piece of ginger and some old brown sugar to room A056.” ”

“Okay.”The receptionist nodded.

“Xia Wei asked curiously, “Miss Chen, is your stomach uncomfortable? I don’t have any warm menstrual paste. It’s very comfortable after you put it on. Do you want to try it?” ”

“Chen Siyan said, “You misunderstood. It’s not my stomach that hurts.” ”

“Then why do you want the old brown sugar and Ginger?”Xia Wei asked curiously.
