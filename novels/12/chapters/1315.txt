“Bai Xiaosu was a loner. After receiving the report card, he didn’t share it with anyone. After taking a look, he walked towards the Deputy Executive’s temporary office. ”

“Seeing Bai Xiaosu walking over, everyone’s expression changed. “Could it be that Bai Xiaosu got 2a?” ”

Only those who got 2a and above were qualified to go to the office.

Because 2A meant that they could be promoted to the management level.

“When they thought of this, everyone’s faces were filled with disbelief. ”

Bai Xiaosu?

2A?

“Wang Tao!”The assessment officer called out again.

“”Here, Here!”Wang Tao ran inside. ”

“After a while, Wang Tao walked out dejectedly. ”

“From the way he looked, it was obvious that he did not get an A. ”

“Someone in the crowd encouraged him. “It doesn’t matter. If you don’t get into 3A this time, you can fight again the year after next!” ”

“”Yes, yes, yes.” ”

“Liu Jing Jing!”

“Upon hearing his name, Liu Jing Jing stood rooted to the ground, his heart beating rapidly. ”

One after another.

“Zheng Wan yin smiled and said, “Jing Jing, it’s your turn. Believe in yourself. Don’t be nervous.” ”

“Liu Jingjing took a deep breath and said, “Okay.” ”

“The moment he received the report card from the examiner, Liu Jingjing’s hands were shaking. “2a, Congratulations!” ”

2A!

Liu Jingjing’s eyes were filled with disbelief as he immediately opened the report card.

It was indeed a bright red 2a!

“Thank You Examiner! Thank you!”Liu Jingjing could not help but bow.

“When he ran out, Liu Jingjing’s footsteps were light. “Wanyin! I’m 2A! 2A! Oh My God, I never thought that I would get 2a even in my dreams!” ”

“It was just 2a, why was she so excited? ”

“She was the default 3A, and she was not like Liu Jingjing. ”

“Although she thought so in her heart, Zheng Wanyin did not show it, she smiled and said, “Jing Jing, you’re really amazing! I told you, you can definitely get 2A! If only I had your good luck!” ”

“Liu Jing smiled and said, “You can do it, you can definitely do it! You can definitely get 2A TOO!” ”

2A?

Liu Jing had really underestimated her.

“Zheng wanyin continued, “Congratulations on advancing to the management level. Jing Jing, quickly go to the CEO’s Office.” ”

“Liu Jing said, “I’ll wait for you to go with me.” ”

“Okay.”Zheng Wanyin nodded.

“When they found out that Liu Jing had gotten 2a, everyone else was envious and went forward to congratulate him. ” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“”Jing Jing got 2a, then Wanyin must be 3A!” ”

“Definitely!”

“Oh my God! I’m so envious of all of you.”

“Zheng Wanyin!”

“At this moment, the audit team announced Zheng Wanyin’s name. ”

“Zheng Wanyin faced everyone and said with a smile, “I’ll go in first.” ”

Everyone made way for Zheng Wanyin.

Zheng Wanyin walked in step by step.

It was just like walking on the red carpet during the awards ceremony.

3a.

The 3A she had always dreamed of.

“According to what she knew, there were basically no core team members who got 3A. She should be the only one who stood out. ”

The remaining spots were all taken by the other teams.

“Very soon, Zheng Wanyin walked up to the assessment officer and bowed slightly. “Hello, Third Assessment Officer. I’m Zheng Wanyin.” ”

“The assessment officer who was sitting in the middle handed over the report card. “Zheng Wanyin, 1a.” ”

1A?

1A!

How could that be!

“At that moment, Zheng Wanyin almost thought that she was hearing things. ”

“Based on her strength, even if it wasn’t 3A, 2a wouldn’t be a problem. ”

How could it be 3A?

There must be a mistake!

There must be a mistake!

“Zheng Wanyin tried hard to maintain her smile. “You, you must have taken the wrong report card, right?” ”

“You’re not Zheng Wanyin?”The examiner picked up the information on the table.

“”Yes, I’m Zheng Wanyin!”Zheng wanyin continued, “But my results are wrong.” ”

The examiner checked Zheng Wanyin’s information. “There’s no mistake. Zheng Wanyin is an a student. This is your report card. Don’t you know how well you did in the exam?”

“Zheng Wanyin stood rooted to the ground, blood flowing backwards all over her body. ”

Ye Zhuo.

It was definitely ye Zhuo.

This was definitely ye Zhuo’s doing.

It was ye Zhuo who deliberately gave her a low score so that she would not be able to get an A student.

Zheng Wanyin did not know how she walked out of the assessment room.

At this moment.

Her heart turned cold.

“”Wanyin is out, Wanyin! You must have gotten 3A!”Liu Jingjing went up to her happily. “Come, let’s go to the CEO’s office together!” ”

3A?

Hur Hur.

She was now a joke.

No.

She could not admit defeat like this.

This was unfair to her.

Zheng Wanyin ignored Liu Jingjing and quickly walked towards the CEO’s office.

She had to find the CEO to make the decision!

“”Wanyin?”Liu Jingjing was very curious. “Wanyin, what’s Wrong?” ”
