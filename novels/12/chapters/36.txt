Chapter 37: Wait For Her To Regret

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Upon hearing that, Qian Lingyu’s expression turned very unpleasant. She had not expected that Ye Zhuo’s influence over the barbecue shop’s business was so immense.

These people were actually here for Ye Zhuo’s beauty, to her surprise.

“Who told you that Little Ye has resigned!? Little Ye is only on a break for the time being. She will be back at work in a few days!”

Sister Liu was stunned for a moment. “Huh? Little Ye hasn’t resigned?”

Qian Lingyu’s expression was getting even worse as she struggled to hide her disappointment. “She hasn’t! Go and tell them that Little Ye will be back at work tomorrow.”

“Ah, sure.” Sister Liu nodded and walked over hastily to tell the customers that Ye Zhuo had not resigned and that she would be back at work tomorrow. As a result, the customers replied that they would come and eat whenever Little Ye was back at work.

Noticing that, Qian Lingyu was furious!

She was under the assumption that Ye Zhuo would be back begging her for the job. It was beyond her expectation that she would have to stoop so low to beg Ye Zhuo now. The very thought disgusted her!

However, it was a crucial juncture now. There was no question whether or not she should bed Ye Zhuo to return. After all, nothing was more important than her business now.

“Boyang! Boyang! You have Ye Zhuo’s WeChat number, right?” In order to keep up the appearances of a boss, Qian Lingyu had deleted Ye Zhuo’s phone number, thinking that Ye Zhuo would certainly come and beg her. Unfortunately, that left her without Ye Zhuo’s contact number even though she wanted to reach out to her now.

“I do. What’s the matter, mom?” Li Boyang walked out from the inside.

Qian Lingyu said, “Send her a WeChat message and tell her that I shall increase her salary to 5,000 bucks. Make her come back to work.”

“Huh?” Li Boyang was stunned for a moment. It was as if he had never imagined that his mother could be so generous. “Mom, are you sure?”

“Mmhmm.” Qian Lingyu nodded.

“Why though?” Li Boyang continued to ask.

“Don’t ask so many questions! Just do as you’re told and send the message to Ye Zhuo.”

Li Boyang realized that Qian Lingyu was upset just by her facial expression, so he did not inquire further. He brought up his WeChat app and sent a message to Ye Zhuo asking if she was available.

He realized that Ye Zhuo was not online because he did not get a reply after he sent the message.

Meanwhile, Qian Lingyu was in a flurry of panic. She was constantly asking Li Boyang, “Has Little Ye replied?”

“No.” Li Boyang shook his head.

After half an hour, Qian Lingyu asked again, “Has she replied?”

Li Boyang shook his head once again.

Qian Lingyu clenched her teeth in rage. The little b*tch Ye Zhuo has not replied even after half an hour! She was obviously doing it on purpose! She has gone too far! She has really gone too far!

Meanwhile, Li Boyang suddenly uttered, “Mom, she replied!”

Qian Lingyu’s eyes lit up. “What did she say?”

Before he said anything, an awkward expression appeared on Li Boyang’s face. “Ye Zhuo said that she has to go to school so she can’t work….”

Was 5,000 bucks still not enough!? That little b*tch! Her appetite for money was too huge!

Qian Lingyu was almost infuriated to death. She clenched her teeth and said, “Tell her that her salary has been increased to 7,000 bucks!”

The basic salary in Yunjing Province was 2,500 bucks. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

7,000 bucks was the salary of an ordinary white-collar worker, so Ye Zhuo should not have an excuse to reject her offer anymore.

“Alright.” Li Boyang nodded.

After a while, Li Boyang said, “Mom, Ye Zhuo said that this is not about the money.”

What was it about if it was not about the money!?

Qian Lingyu’s face turned pale in anger.

She really did not expect that Ye Zhuo would demand such an exorbitant price! Even 7,000 bucks was not enough to satisfy her.

Qian Lingyu pondered for a moment and figured that the profit that Ye Zhuo could bring to the shop was more than just the small amount of 7,000 bucks. So, she inhaled a deep breath and said, “Tell her that her salary will be increased to 15,000 bucks!”

Upon hearing that, Li Boyang looked at Qian Lingyu in astonishment. He was under the assumption that he might have misheard his mother.

“Mom, did you say 15,000 bucks?”

Qian Lingyu nodded. “Mmhmm. 15,000!”

Li Boyang suppressed the shock in his heart and then sent a message to Ye Zhuo.

It came as a surprise to Li Boyang because Ye Zhuo had actually rejected this offer as well.

It was 15,000!

“Mom, Ye Zhuo said it really isn’t about the money….”

Qian Lingyu was almost dying in anger because she had already raised it to 15,000!

What else did Ye Zhuo want!?

Could it be that she wanted her salary to be increased to 100,000? Why was she so shameless!?

“Mom, what should I reply now?” Li Boyang asked.

“Don’t bother!” Qian Lingyu said furiously, “The little b*tch is putting up a front! It’s fine if she doesn’t come! I don’t believe that the barbecue shop can’t survive without her!”

Even if Ye Zhuo were to search through the entire Yunjing Province, she would not be able to get a job that paid a wage of 15,000 bucks monthly.

She was uncultured, and she did not have much working experience. Who would pay 15,000 bucks to hire a server? Was that person a fool?

“So, I won’t bother her then?”

Qian Lingyu nodded. “Mmhmm, don’t bother! Just wait! In less than three days, she’ll come begging us!”

Upon saying that, Qian Lingyu added, “If she were to regret and come looking for you on WeChat, don’t reply to her!”

“Alright.” Li Boyang added, “Mom, will Ye Zhuo come begging us for real?”

“Of course!” Qian Lingyu was confident. “She didn’t want to come back even when I offered her 15,000 bucks. When she does come begging later on, she won’t get such a high offer anymore! Boyang, just wait for Ye Zhuo to regret!”

Li Boyang nodded.

Granny Cen strolled around the park for a few rounds in her disguise before she returned home.

She was preparing to have her medicine, but she discovered that the kitchen did not prepare the medicine at all.

Granny Cen sought the butler and asked, “Old Zhang, why haven’t you instructed the kitchen to prepare my medicine?”

The butler had yet to speak when Zhou Xiang walked over and said, “Mom, about the medicine that you had Butler Zhang buy... I already had Doctor Lin take a look at it. Doctor Lin said that those are all ordinary medicinal herbs that won’t have much effect on your headache.”

“I haven’t even tried it, so how would he know that it’s not effective?” Granny Cen asked.

Zhou Xiang replied, “Mom, Doctor Lin is a famous doctor in Yunjing Province, so he has surely given you good advice! Any medicine contains a little toxicity, so it is best not to take any new ones. You can take the medicine prescribed by Doctor Lin with peace of mind.”

Granny Cen pursed her lips. “If he is a miracle doctor, why hasn’t he cured my illness until now? I can see that he is a quack! He is incapable, yet he is trying to deny my granddaughter-in-law’s capability!”

“Mom, you’ve had the headache for over two decades, so it has to be treated slowly. How can it be accomplished within a short period of time? I trust that Doctor Lin will certainly cure you.”

Granny Cen waved his hand. “Old Zhang, have the kitchen prepare the medicine. Do it quickly!”

There was no telling what sort of drug the young maiden fed to Madam Cen such that Madam Cen trusted her so much.

Madam Cen was old, but she would rather trust a young maiden’s words than a doctor’s advice. Was her action not akin to treating her health like a joke?

Zhou Xiang furrowed her brows ever so slightly. “Doctor Lin advised you not to take other medicine simultaneously when you’re taking his medicine; otherwise, it will only delay the treatment progress.”

Upon hearing that, Granny Cen said in anger, “I won’t take the medicine prescribed by Doctor Lin then. From today onward, I will only take the medicine prescribed by my granddaughter-in-law!”

Zhou Xiang heaved a sigh. “Mom!”

Granny Cen heaved a sigh as well. She stretched out her hand to hold Zhou Xiang’s hand and said in an earnest tone, “Xiang Xiang, I know that you’re doing this for me, and you’re worried that something might happen to me. I’ve been having this illness for over two decades, and do you know how I endured it for the past 20 years? Every time I have a flare-up, I’m in so much agony that I wish I could die… Even when I’m not sick, I have trouble sleeping every night. Over the past 20 years or so, I haven’t been able to sleep through the night soundly. Xiang Xiang, just let me give this a try.”
