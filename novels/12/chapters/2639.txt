This was probably the first time Sun Guixiang saw Zhou Cuihua’s smiling face in the past two months.

It was strange.

It was really strange.

Zhou Cuihua actually took the initiative to come to her door and even spoke to her so politely.

There must be something wrong if something went wrong.

“Sun Guixiang leaned against the door. “Look Who’s back! Oh, so it’s our CEO’s wife!” ”

“Sun Guixiang’s sarcastic words made Zhou cuihua lose her balance. “Sister-in-law, we’re family. Don’t talk like that.” ”

“”Family?”Sun guixiang continued, “That’s funny. Who’s family with you? Who Are You Now? A high and mighty lady. Who Am I? I’m just an ordinary housewife. I don’t have the right to be related to you.” ”

“As she spoke, Sun Guixiang carefully sized up Zhou cuihua. ”

“Zhou cuihua tried her best to maintain a smile on her face. No matter how bad her words sounded, Zhou Cuihua was still not angry. ”

What surprised Sun Guixiang the most was that the overbearing aura on Zhou Cuihua’s body disappeared in an instant.

How rare was this!

One had to know that Zhou Cuihua had her nose up and did not care about anyone at all.

“Zhou cuihua smiled and said, “Sister-in-law, I know that it was all my fault in the past. I know that I’m wrong now. Sister-in-law, it’s not a big deal for us to just stand here. Let Me in first.” ”

“”Wrong? How could you be wrong! You’re not wrong! It’s US who are wrong! How could people from a small family like us have anything to do with you!”Sun guixiang continued, “You should go. There’s no brother here. Don’t get involved with relatives!” ” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Regardless of whether Zhou Cuihua was rich or not, Sun Guixiang did not want to have anything to do with this kind of person. ”

Because some things could be done after they had happened once!

They definitely could not be sent a second time!

“Zhou Cuihua’s eyes were slightly red as she looked at Sun Guixiang. “Sister-in-law! No matter what, I’m still my brother’s biological sister! How can you say such things!” ”

“”Oh, now you know that these words are unpleasant to hear?”Sun Guixiang only felt that Zhou Cuihua was very laughable. “When you did these things back then, why didn’t you think of today?” ”

Do to others what you don’t want to do to yourself!

“Sun guixiang continued, “What did you say back then when Hanghang relocated its household registration? It’s only been a few days, and you’ve already forgotten?” ”

“At this point, Sun Guixiang looked at Zhou cuihua from head to toe, then, she said, “Looking at you, it should be that rich businessman who doesn’t want you anymore, right? What? We, my family, are garbage collectors, right? When you didn’t need us, we weren’t even as good as the rocks by the roadside. Now that the rich man doesn’t want you anymore, you came to find us! We’re garbage collectors?” ”

It was simply too disgusting!

Sun Guixiang was furious.

What the hell!

“Zhou Cuihua’s eyes were filled with tears. “Sister-in-law, are you saying these words from a human? I share the same blood as my brother! Yes! I admit that I’m down and out now, but who hasn’t been down and out before?” ”

She had never thought that Sun Guixiang would treat her like this.

She had never thought that she would one day be despised by her family.

What the hell was this!

“”Yeah! Can anyone say that?”Sun guixiang continued, “You said it so well! Zhou cuihua, you’re so cute. Ask yourself, what you did, was it something that a human could do?” ”

“I don’t want to tell you! Where’s My Brother?”Zhou cuihua only wanted to see Zhou Xiatian right away.

She believed that Zhou Xiatian would definitely make the decision for her!

Sun Guixiang was still an outsider to her!

“”I’m sorry, our old Zhou doesn’t have a sister like you!”Sun Guixiang said. ”

“Brother! Brother!”Zhou cuihua shouted at the top of her lungs.

“Who is it?”Zhou Xiatian walked out from inside.

“When she saw Zhou Xiatian, Zhou cuihua immediately cried out, “Brother!” ”

“When she saw Zhou cuihua, Zhou Xiatian was stunned for a moment before she said, “Why are you here?” ”

“Logically speaking, Zhou Cui Hua should not have appeared here at such a time. ”

“”Brother, that Wang Zhengxuan is a liar. He lied to me!” ”

Liar.

“Zhou Xia Tian was not surprised when he heard this, ”

“because from the beginning, he knew that Wang Zhengxuan was definitely not a good person. ”

“Therefore, he was not surprised that Zhou Cui’s words had fallen to such a state. ”

He just did not expect that this day would come so quickly.

It was too fast!

It had only been a few days?

“”It’s really hard for you to still remember that I’m your brother,”Zhou Xiatian continued, “Some things are not in the past. You should leave. I’ve said before that I won’t have a sister like you in the future.” ”
