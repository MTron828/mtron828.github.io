“Chapter 1342: 277: Xie Wanqiu’s secret, stupid to the extreme”

Translator: 549690339

“Otherwise, he wouldn’t have ignored Xie Wanqiu’s sudden disappearance from the Cen family. ”

“But now, there was no other way except to ask Cen Shaoqing to come over. ”

Zhou Xiang nodded. “Then I’ll go back and tell your cousin about this.”

A glimmer flashed across Zheng Wanyin’s eyes.

It was just as she thought.

Zhou Xiang did not tell Cen Shaoqing about Xie wanqiu’s illness and hospitalization.

No wonder Cen Shaoqing looked so relaxed. He was still chatting and laughing with Ye Zhuo.

“Zheng wanyin said, “Second aunt, I’ll wait for Your Good News.” ”

“Okay.”

After leaving the hospital.

Zhou Xiang gave Cen Shaoqing a call.

“Shaoqing.”

“Mom.”Cen Shaoqing’s voice came from the other end of the screen.

“Zhou Xiang was mulling over the words in her heart. “Shaoqing, your grandmother is sick and is in the hospital. Can you go and see her?” ”

Sick?

Xie Wanqiu?

“Cen Shaoqing’s eyes were dark and heavy. “She must be faking it. Mom, you don’t have to worry about her.” ”

“Zhou Xiang did not dare to tell Cen Shaoqing the actual situation. If Cen Shaoqing knew that Xie Wanqiu actually asked ye Zhuo to apologize to her, even Zhou Xiang did not dare to imagine the consequences. ”

She did not want Cen Shaoqing to bear the name of being unfilial.

“No matter what, Xie Wanqiu was Cen Shaoqing’s grandmother. ”

They were still relatives.

“If word got out, it would not be pleasant to hear. ”

“Zhou xiang continued, “I don’t think she’s faking it. Shaoqing, why don’t you go and take a look? She’s been in the hospital for a few days...” ”

“”Cold treatment.”Cen Shaoqing’s tone was indifferent. “When she realizes that no one is paying attention to her, she’ll naturally feel that it’s meaningless.” ”

“The more Xie wanqiu paid attention to her, the more enthusiastic she became. ”

“If she was given a ladder, she would be able to climb up the ladder to the sky. ”

The best way to solve the problem was to pretend that she wasn’t there.

“”Shaoqing...”Zhou Xiang said, “She’s your grandmother after all. Isn’t it a little bad for you to do this?” ”

“Mom.”Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads. “Grandma has passed away for more than 50 years.”

“Zhou Xiang sighed. “Shaoqing, even if I beg you, can you do it? In all these years, I have never begged you for anything!” ”

“As long as Cen Shaoqing went over, the problem would be solved. Zhou Xiang still hoped that Cen Shaoqing could go over. ”

“Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly. “Mom, Xie Wanqiu is not worthy of you treating her like this. She is even less worthy of being an elder.” ”

“Zhou Xiang sighed, “Shaoqing, how can I not know who your grandmother is? But what can we do when we have to deal with such an elder? She’s already over 70 years old this year. How many more years can she go through? Can you just do me a Favor?” ”

Everything was fate. It was not up to anyone.

“My grandmother has passed away for more than 50 years.”

“After saying that, Cen Shaoqing hung up the phone. ”

“Looking at the phone that was hung up, Zhou Xiang frowned. ”

Cen Shaoqing was not willing to visit Xie wanqiu...

What should he do?

The old and the young were too stubborn.

“However, CEN Shaoqing could not be blamed for this. ”

“When Cen Shaoqing was young, Xie Wanqiu’s grandmother did not do things well. ”

On the other side.

In the ward.

“Zheng Wanyin poured a glass of water for Xie wanqiu. “Grandma, Please Calm Down. Second aunt didn’t do it on purpose. She just told me outside that she would ask cousin to come and see you immediately.” ”

“”Did she ask Shaoqing to come and see me, or did you remind her to ask Shaoqing to come and see me?” ”

Zheng Wanyin lowered her head and did not say anything.

“Xie wanqiu sneered. “I guessed it! Zhou Xiang, that B * tch, she has never taken me, her mother, to Heart!” ”

“”Actually, second aunt is very filial to you,”Zheng Wanyin said. ”

“At that moment, there was a knock on the door. ”

Could it be that Cen Shaoqing was here?

So Fast?

“However, it was normal. Cen Shaoqing was already near the hospital, so he came quickly. ”

“Xie wanqiu quickly laid on the bed and pretended to be very weak. “Yinyin, go and open the door.” ”

“Okay.”Zheng Wanyin turned around to open the door.

“Before opening the door, Zheng Wanyin took a deep breath and put on a decent smile. She reached out to open the door. ”

“The moment the door was opened, she saw an old man in his sixties or seventies standing outside. His hair was a little white. ” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Zheng Wanyin was stunned and her smile froze. “May I ask who you are?”

“The old man took a step forward. “You must be yinyin! I’m from your grandmother’s hometown. My surname is Wu. You Can Call Me Grandpa Wu. I heard that your grandmother is not feeling well, so I specially came to see her.” ”

“Zheng wanyin said politely, “Hello, Grandpa Wu. My Grandma is inside. Please follow me in.” ”

Wu Youyu followed Zheng Wanyin’s footsteps.

“Xie wanqiu heard that something was wrong with the voice inside. She even thought that she was hearing things. When Zheng Wanyin’s voice sounded again in the ward, “Grandma, Grandpa Wu is here.” ”

Grandpa Wu?

Xie Wanqiu was stunned.

She wasn’t dreaming!

“Xie wanqiu immediately sat up from the bed and looked up. As expected, she saw Wu Youyu. Her face was full of shock. ”

“”Wanqiu.”Wu youyu smiled and said, “Don’t you recognize me? I’m Wu Youyu! Last night, we even talked on the phone!” ”

“”Brother, Brother Youyu, why are you here?” ”

“Wu youyu said, “I just happened to be in the capital on some business, so I came by to see you! Are You Alright?” ”

Xie wanqiu shook her head. “It’s nothing serious. You Don’t have to worry.”

“Wu youyu said, “It’s good that you’re alright. We’re already so old, we can’t withstand the torment!” ”

Zheng Wanyin brought over a glass of water. “Have some water.”

“Wu Youyu took the water with both hands. “Thank you, Lass.” ”

“”Grandpa Wu, you’re too polite.” ”

“Wu Youyu turned to look at Xie wanqiu and continued, “Wanqiu, this lass is exactly the same as when you were young.” ”

Xie wanqiu nodded. “That’s right.”

“After saying that, Xie wanqiu turned to look at Zheng Wanyin and continued, “Yinyin, I suddenly feel like eating the Su’s oil tea fruit that you bought for me last time. Can You Go and buy me a Portion?” ”

“Sure.”Zheng Wanyin nodded. “I’ll go right now.”

“Xie wanqiu continued, “Remember, it has to be from Su’s.” ”

“”Okay, got it.” ”

“Su’s oil tea fruit business was particularly popular. Every time, they had to queue for 20 to 30 minutes before they could buy it. ”

“Since Xie Wanqiu wanted to eat it, Zheng Wanyin could only go and buy it. ”

Bang —

The door was closed.

“Wu Youyu turned back to look at the closed door. After making sure that Zheng Wanyin had gone far away, he held Xie Wanqiu’s hand and said in a low voice, “WANQIU, you have no idea how much I’ve missed you these past few days.” ”

Xie wanqiu pulled her hand back in exasperation. “You’re too bold! It’s daytime!”

“After so many years, they had always met at night. ”

“It was daytime. When she first saw Wu Youyu, Xie Wanqiu thought that she was hallucinating. ”

She was almost scared out of her wits.

“Wu youyu smiled and said, “Don’t tell me that Zhou can extend his hand to the capital city! You’re good at everything, but you’re too timid.” ”

Xie wanqiu rolled her eyes at him.

Wu Youyu grabbed Xie wanqiu’s hand and kissed it against his face. “It’s been so many days. Don’t You Miss Me?”

“Xie wanqiu continued, “You should leave before yinyin comes back!” ”

“”Since I’m here, I’m not afraid that Yinyin will see me,”wu youyu continued, “Besides, we’ve been together for so many years. Didn’t that Idiot Zhou also discover nothing?” ”

Xie wanqiu was very supportive of calling Father Zhou an idiot.

“She had been together with Wu Youyu for more than thirty years. During this period, she had transferred more than half of the Zhou family’s assets to Wu Youyu. Father Zhou had never doubted it. ”

“Sometimes, even she herself felt that there were many flaws, but Father Zhou did not notice it at all. ”
