She was very beautiful.

She was more stunning than any girl Han Zhen had ever seen.

“It could be said that after seeing ye Zhuo, those people whom she had called beauties were not called beauties. ”

“Before seeing ye Zhuo, Han Zhen had heard ye Zhuo’s name from master Yu more than once. ”

“From Master Yu’s words, it was not hard to tell that he was very satisfied with Ye Zao. ”

“Therefore, Han Zhen was also very curious about Master Yu, the last disciple of Master Yu. ”

She originally thought that she would meet an ordinary-looking girl wearing thick glasses.

She did not expect that.

“She did not expect that not only did ye Zao not wear glasses, but he was also so good-looking. ”

“Such a young and beautiful girl, did she really aspire to be in the literary world? ”

Perhaps... ? ... could she really be qualified to be Master Yu’s last disciple?

Even the highly respected Han Zhen could not help but recall that rumor in the literary world.

“Ye Zhuo looked at Han Zhen and politely said, “Hello, President Han.” ”

“Hello.”Han Zhen took the initiative to shake hands with Ye Zhuo.

“When they saw Han Zhen here, other people immediately came over. ”

This was because Han Zhen was not the only one who was curious about ye Zao. There were also other people who were curious about ye Zao.

“”Miss Ye, I heard that Master Yu and your grandfather are old friends for many years. Is this true?”A sweet-looking young woman asked. ”

“This woman was called Zhou Miaoyan. Previously, Han Zhen had recommended her to be Master Yu’s disciple. ”

“Unfortunately, master Yu refused. ”

“When she heard that Master Yu had taken in a disciple in the capital city, Zhou Miaoyan was extremely curious. ”

She had joined the literary world at the age of 12 and thought that her literary attainments were very good. She had never thought that she would lose to an unknown junior that she had never heard of.

Zhou Miaoyan’s words were a provocation and a taunt.

What right did a person who relied on connections to enter the literary world have to appear in the same examination hall as them.

“When they heard this, everyone looked at ye Zao curiously. ”

“After all, Ye Zao only became Master Yu’s last disciple through the back door. This was just a rumor. As for whether ye Zao’s grandfather and Master Yu were close friends, no one knew if this was true. ”

Everyone was looking forward to ye Zao’s answer.

“Ye Zao was not embarrassed. He smiled and said, “Yes, my grandfather and my master were very close old friends.” ”

So it was true!

Everyone had different expressions.

Zhou Miaoyan began to despise ye Zao from the bottom of her heart.

“She did not know how ye Zao had the nerve to admit it, but his face was not red and his heart was not beating. ”

His face could be said to be the corner of the city wall.

“Zhou Miaoyan continued, “Miss Ye, I heard that you have outstanding talent and unparalleled talent! Tomorrow is the assessment competition. What rank do you think you can get?” ” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Which place?

“A person who relied on her connections to become Master Yu’s disciple, how many places could she get? ”

She probably came to the bottom as well.

Ye Zao smiled slightly. “There shouldn’t be any problem getting first place.”

First place?

Ye Zao really dared to say that!

The mocking look in Zhou Miaoyan’s eyes was almost overflowing.

Wang Zhishu’s face flushed red. He also felt embarrassed for ye Zao.

Ye Zao would be thankful if he couldn’t be ranked last.

She actually boasted shamelessly that she was ranked first?

First!

Did she think that first place was so easy to obtain?

No one knew where ye Zao’s confidence came from.

Master Yu was also old and muddle-headed. He actually gave ye Zao a backdoor.

The other people looked at ye Zao with very interesting eyes.

Han Zhen didn’t say anything.

She had always admired confident juniors.

“However, she did not like a junior who was blindly confident and complacent. ”

It would have been fine if ye Zao had the ability.

“However, ye Zao did not have the ability at all. ”

“If it were not for Master Yu, she would not even have the qualifications to step into the assessment venue. ”

“At this moment, Han Zhen also felt that Master Yu’s decision to accept a disciple was too hasty. ”

“Zhou Miaoyan smiled and said, “Miss ye is indeed worthy of being master Yu’s personal disciple. You have guts! I believe that Miss Ye will definitely crush everyone and get first place!” ”

“Wang Zhishu was extremely embarrassed. He was embarrassed for ye Zhuo and also for himself. He stood out and said, “Miss Ye, didn’t you say that you were tired just now? Why Don’t we go back first?” ”

“En.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Wang Zhishu looked at Han Zhen and Zhou Miaoyan. “President Han, Miss Zhou, we’ll be leaving first then.” ”

Han Zhen nodded.

Zhou Miaoyan’s lips curled into a smile.

“After the two of them left, the crowd began to discuss. ”

“I really didn’t expect master Yu to pick such a person as his last disciple! Someone like her actually wants to get first place! It’s hilarious!”

“”To be honest, I also didn’t expect her to say that she got first place.” ”

“”I heard that the last disciple position was originally given to another girl with the surname Feng. It was because ye Zhuo’s grandfather had been kind to master Yu, so...” ”

“”Then she’s really shameless! She doesn’t have a diamond in the rough, but she still wants to take on a porcelain job!” ”

“I also heard that this Miss Feng will also participate in today’s assessment competition.”

“Is that true?”

“”Of course it’s true! I heard that Miss Feng met Bo Le in a thousand miles and was appreciated by the vice president of the Chinese Arts Association, Liu Caiyi. It was Liu Caiyi who recommended her to participate in today’s assessment competition.” ”

“...”

“Listening to the discussions of the crowd, Feng Xianxian, who was sitting in her seat doing a mock question, curled her lips slightly. The corners of her mouth were filled with pride. ”

She did not expect that the news of ye Zao using a backdoor would spread from the capital city to the literary world.

“Now, she was just waiting for the assessment competition tomorrow. ”

“When the time came, Ye Zao would be ranked last while she would be ranked first in the positive category. ”

Who knew how master Yu would regret it!

He just didn’t know where ye Zao would put his face when the time came.

The girl sitting behind Feng Xianxian poked Feng Xianxian’s back with a pen.

“What’s the matter?”Feng Xianxian turned her head.

“”Is the Miss Feng they’re talking about you?”This girl was the daughter of another big shot in the literary world. Zhao Tong, Zhao Tong was forced to participate in the assessment competition. She didn’t expect to see such a big show. ”

“Zhao Tong knew the identities of every contestant, but she didn’t know much about Feng Xianxian and ye Zhuo. ”

It was as if the two of them had descended from the sky.

Feng Xianxian nodded in embarrassment. “It’s me.”

“Zhao Tong continued to ask, “Was it really ye Zhuo who took your things?” ”

Feng Xianxian lowered her head. “Ye Zhuo was born rich and had a good grandfather. I can’t compare to her.”

“Zhao Tong frowned. From her looks, ye Zao didn’t seem like the kind of girl who would force others. “Is there a misunderstanding?” ”

“Feng Xianxian laughed self-deprecatingly. “Maybe, but I will use my strength to prove myself.” ”

She wanted everyone to see her excellence.

What was ye Zao?

Ye Zao was destined to be her stepping stone.

“Seeing Feng Qianqian like this, Zhao Tong did not know who to trust. She was a complete beauty. Ye Zao was so beautiful. She had originally wanted to be friends with ye Zao... ”

It seemed that she could only wait for the results of the assessment tomorrow.

“If ye Zao really had everything that he had now because of the backdoor, then she definitely would not get any good results. ”

“If ye Zao had great talent, then she would not be afraid of this assessment competition. ”

...

On the other side.

Wang Zhishu sent ye Zao to the hotel.

“Just as they got off the elevator, Zheng Zikai and Sun openg walked to the front and said with some surprise, “Didn’t you bring Miss Ye to the examination venue? Why did you come back so quickly?” ”

“Wang zhishu said somewhat speechlessly, “Don’t mention it! That Miss Ye did not plan to take the exam properly at all!” ”

“What’s going on?”

“Wang zhishu said, “I went there to take a look and was about to come back. I asked her to take a look at the mock exam, but she actually said there was no need!”! Later, she was stopped by Zhou Miaoyan. Zhou Miaoyan deliberately ridiculed her. How many places could she take the exam tomorrow! Do you know how she answered?” ”

Zheng Zikai and Sun Openg shook their heads.

“Wang zhishu said, “She actually said she could take the first place!” ”
