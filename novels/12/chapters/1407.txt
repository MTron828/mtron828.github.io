Chapter 1408: 302: the whole Internet is in a rage

Translator: 549690339

“Although Old Mrs. Cen had never met Wu Lan, she could tell from her words that Wu Lan was an extremely gentle person. ”

“She really had no other choice, so she chose to commit suicide. ”

“If she and Zhou Zuolong were just a bunch of ordinary couples, it would be fine. ”

“However, she and Zhou Zuolong were very passionate. ”

“For the sake of Zhou Zuolong, she had turned against her biological parents. ”

“From this suicide note, it could be seen that Wu Lan was already suffering from a very serious depression at this time. ”

“Even with the development of modern medicine, there was no way to treat depression. ”

Not to mention Wu Lan’s era.

“After a moment, Zhou Jinbei turned to look at Ye Zao. “Zao Zao, thank you. Thank you for letting everything come to light and clearing my mother’s name.” ”

This sentence of getting justice was not wrong at all.

Zhou Zuolong made use of the fact that no one knew what had happened 30 years ago to frame Wu Lan as a woman who did not follow the rules of womanhood. He even spewed nonsense in front of the media.

“Now, not only were the netizens scolding Zhou jinbei, they were also scolding Wu Lan as well. ”

“Now, they could finally clear Wu Lan’s name. ”

“At the end of his speech, Zhou Jinbei directly bowed to ye Zao. ”

“Ye Zao quickly helped Zhou Jinbei up. “Uncle, don’t be like this. I Can’t take it.” ”

“”No, Zao Zao.”Zhou Jinbei looked at ye Zao. “You can take it. If you don’t accept this bow today, uncle will have a guilty conscience for the rest of his life.” ”

“If it wasn’t for ye Zao, the truth would never have surfaced. ”

And Wu Lan would also be cursed at for the rest of her life.

No one knew how grateful Zhou Jinbei was to ye Zao.

“Hearing this, Ye Zao finally let go of Zhou Jinbei. ”

Zhou Jinbei stood there and bowed very seriously.

“”And me.”Zhou Xiang cried as she stood up from the ground and looked at ye Zao. “Zao Zao, thank you...” ”

Zhou Xiang recalled her past self again. She felt that she was a joke.

“Zhou Zuolong and Xie wanqiu treated her like a fool, but she was completely unaware of it. ”

“Not only did she not know, but she also wanted to show filial respect to Zhou Zuolong and Xie Wanqiu. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen looked at Zhou Xiang and continued, “Zhou Zuolong and Xie Wanqiu are in the second courtyard. Xiang Xiang, are you still going to visit them?” ”

“”I’m not going.”Zhou Xiang shook her head. “Mom, I’m sorry. I was too muddle-headed before. I made you worry too much.” ”

“After spending so much time with old Mrs. Cen, Zhou Xiang knew that old Mrs. Cen was an impatient person. ”

“Previously, she did not have a clear understanding of people. All she could think about was Xie wanqiu and Zhou Zuolong. Old Mrs. Cen must have been very anxious and wished that she could slap her awake. ”

Zhou Xiang had always felt that she was not muddle-headed.

“Only now did she truly understand the saying, “Those who are in the middle are muddled and those who are watching from the sidelines are clear.”. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen’s eyes were slightly red. “Xiangxiang, I hope that you’ve really seen it this time. You’ve truly grown up.” ”

“”Mom, I’m sorry...”Zhou Xiang hugged old Mrs. Cen. ”

The mother-in-law and daughter-in-law hugged and wept.

“Cen Shaoqing held the Buddhist beads in his hand. There was no special emotion on his face. He just looked at Zhou Jinbei. “Uncle, leave this matter to me.” ”

“Zhou Jinbei raised a smile and said, “Shaoqing, uncle knows about your ability, but I want to handle this matter myself.” ”

This was a matter between him and Zhou Zuolong. Zhou Jinbei did not want to dirty CEN Shaoqing’s hands.

“Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly and said, “If you need help, remember to let me know.” ”

“Okay.”Zhou Jinbei nodded. “I will.”

“”Oh right, uncle.”Ye Zhuo took out another envelope. “This is for you.” ”

Zhou Jinbei took the envelope. “What’s This?”

“You’ll know after you read it.”

“Okay.”Zhou Jinbei did not open the envelope immediately but nodded.

“After ye Zhuo left, Zhou Jinbei logged into Weibo and posted a statement of more than 200 words with a picture attached. ”

The content of the picture was Wu Lan’s suicide note.

“Of course, this was not enough. ”

Zhou Jinbei also posted the alimony payments he had given Zhou Zuolong over the years.

“Zhou Zuolong asked Zhou Jinbei to give him three million a month for living expenses, which was 36 million a year. ”

“He started to transfer Zhou Zuolong’s living expenses when he was 28 years old, and this transfer lasted for 20 years. ”

“In the beginning, it was 5 million a year. ”

“Zhou Jinbei had already expected such a day to come. Therefore, he carefully kept every single transfer, including the one from 20 years ago. ”

“Other than these transfer records, there was also an audio recording. ”

“”Zhou Jinbei, I am your father. Since I can give birth to you, I can also destroy you. From now on, you must transfer 3 million a month to me. Otherwise, I will find a newspaper, a reporter, and I will expose you!” ”

“After Zhou Jinbei sent out this statement, the entire internet was in an uproar. ”

No one had expected that things would turn out this way.

“[ F * ck! 36,000,000 yuan a year, and that old guy still has the face to say that Zhou Jinbei doesn’t support him! ] ”

“[ the suicide note is making me cry. Oh My God, if it wasn’t for this suicide note, wouldn’t we have wronged Ms. Wu for the rest of her life? ] ”

“[ from this suicide note, it can be seen that Ms. Wu is a good woman. Even if she was harmed by the scumbag and the mistress in the end, she still taught her children to be a good person in the future... ] ”

“[ Mr. Zhou, I’m sorry. I apologize for my words and actions previously. ] ” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“[ tears welled up in my eyes. As a mother, I can see how helpless Ms. Wu was at that time. As long as she had the slightest chance of survival, she would not have chosen the path of suicide. ] ”

“[ just looking at the suicide note made me feel extremely uncomfortable, not to mention Ms. Wu, the victim. ] ”

“[ ms. Wu, you don’t deserve to die. If you were dead, it would help those scumbags! If I Were you, since I had already chosen to die, I wouldn’t let them have it easy. ] ”

“[ oh my God! I’m sorry, I’m sorry, Ms. Wu. I didn’t mean to... ] ”

[ I’m sorry. ]

[ I’m sorry. ]

“Soon, another hot topic appeared. ”

# Ms. Wu is sorry #

# Zhou Jinbei responded #

# the real mistress! #

“After the new hot topic appeared, Zhou Zuolong’s account, which had already gained tens of millions of fans, instantly dropped from eight digits to six digits. ”

The comment on Weibo that accused Zhou Jinbei of not supporting the elderly went from five digits to seven digits.

“[ it’s not that the elderly have become bad, it’s that the bad people have become old. How can there be such a disgusting person like you in the world? ] ”

“[ old man, you will go to Hell After You Die! ] ”

“[ you were clearly the one who cheated first, yet the evil people complained first. You took advantage of Madam Wu’s long sleep to do whatever you wanted. Little did you know that the heavens are watching, and there is a God above you! ] ”

“[ good and evil will always be rewarded. The Heavenly Dao is good for reincarnation. If you don’t believe it, look up and see who the heavens will spare! ] ”

[ a person like you should be chemically castrated! ]

[ I wish you a speedy journey to hell! ]

“[ the person above is too kind. How can I wish it a speedy journey to hell? ]? [ I should wish it a long life of a hundred years. Half of its body is paralyzed, and the rest of its life is spent eating, drinking, and defecating in bed. If it wants to live, it can’t live. If it wants to die, it can’t! ]! “Every day, it will live in repentance toward Ms. Wu!” ”

“”Yes, yes, yes. The man upstairs is right. When we treat such a beast, we should make it want to die. If it wants to die, it can not live.” ”

“”Old Beast! From now on, I will pray for you every morning. I wish you a long life!” ”

On the other side.

“Zhou Zuolong and Xie wanqiu, who were in the hospital, did not know what was happening on the Internet. ”

Zheng Wanyin jogged back from outside. “Grandpa! Grandpa!”

“What’s Wrong?”Zhou Zuolong turned to look at Zheng Wanyin.

“Zheng wanyin continued, “Grandpa, there are a lot of reporters outside. They said they’re here to interview you.” ”

“Zheng Wanyin had just gone out to buy a house. When she returned, there were reporters outside the hospital. ”

“She did not know about the new trending topics on Weibo, nor did she know that the situation had completely reversed. ”

“Zhou Zuolong stood up and said, “Let them in! No, your grandmother needs to rest well now. Let me go out and meet them! which door are the reporters at now?” ”

What were the reporters here for?

They were definitely here to scold Zhou Jinbei for his unfilial behavior.

“Originally, Zhou Zuolong had planned to forgive Zhou Jinbei and did not want to argue with him. He did not expect that Zhou Jinbei would actually take an inch and take a mile. ”

“In that case, there was no need for him to save face for Zhou Jinbei. ”

“Since the matter had already been exposed, he would let Zhou Jinbei’s reputation be completely ruined. ”

“Zheng wanyin continued, “The reporters are at the main entrance.” ”

“”Alright, I got it.”Zhou Zuolong nodded. “Take good care of your grandmother. I’ll be back soon.” ”

“Xie wanqiu said hypocritically, “Old Man, that’s enough. Don’t make things too difficult for the child! We only have one son, Jinbei!” ”

Zhou Zuolong did not say anything. He waved his hand and walked out of the door.

“When he reached the door, Zhou Zuolong indeed saw a group of reporters. ”

Zhou Zuolong had a sad look on his face. He was writing a script as he walked forward.

At this moment.

PA —

A rotten egg was thrown at Zhou Zuolong’s head.

“”Old Bastard, you still have the face to come out!” ”

“At the same time, a microphone was handed over, “Old Mr. Zhou, may I ask if the statement that Mr. Xiao Zhou posted on Weibo is true? Are You and your current wife really having an affair? Also, you said that Mr. Xiao Zhou has never been obligated to support you. May I ask what happened to the transfer records that Mr. Xiao Zhou provided?” ”
