“To song Chenyu, this was simply killing two birds with one stone. ”

“Firstly, it could confirm that ye Zao was kept as a mistress. ”

“Secondly, it could make Cen Shaoqing completely loathe ye Zao. ”

Who Was Cen Shaoqing?

Cen Wuye who stood at the top of the pyramid!

“Such a person, would he be willing to be tied up by a woman? ”

Definitely Not!

“According to what song Chenyu knew, Ye Zao would also attend the press conference tonight. She was looking forward to the scene of ye Zao being blocked at the entrance by the reporters. ”

“Thinking of this, the corners of Song Chenyu’s lips curled up. ”

She had been waiting for this moment for too long.

“The previous injury incident had caused ye Zao to gain so much popularity on Weibo. This time, she wanted ye Zao to return it with interest. ”

Ten minutes later.

Two hot searches exploded on Weibo.

# Country 2’s hot female lead’s relationship is suspected to be exposed #

[ F * ck! F * ck! This is too explosive! But this man is so handsome! ]

[ inexplicably matching his face. ]

[ Ahhh! I’m going to lick the screen. ]

“Song Chenyu browsed through the comments one by one, frowning slightly. ”

This was not quite what she had imagined.

She had thought that someone would recognize Cen Shaoqing.

Song Chenyu switched her Weibo account to a sub-account and then commented.

“[ if I’m not mistaken, this man should be the chief CEO of CEN Group, Cen Wuye. Please come out and confirm group ] ”

“After editing the text, song Chenyu spent money to make this comment a popular one. ”

“After seeing this comment, the onlookers who were licking their lips immediately lost their composure. ”

“[ F * ck, this melon is a little group. ] ”

[@cen group. ]

“[@cen group, is this Cen Wuye? ] ”

“[ oh my God, I thought I would never see Cen Wuye in my lifetime! Thanks to the Internet, the Internet is really powerful now! ] ”

[ wasn’t there a rumor that Cen Wuye might become a monk? Why would he suddenly find a girlfriend? ]

[ are you sure it’s a girlfriend? What if it’s an employment relationship? There was a report that Cen Wuye is an unmarried man. ]

In what kind of situation would an employment relationship be formed?

An employer.

[ an employer! ]

[ I knew it. A small streamer can also appear in country 2. It turns out that she has a big financial backer supporting her! ]

[ this big financier has quite a background. ]

“[ this photo was leaked by someone I hired, right? After all, Cen Wuye is a non-marital person. She wants Cen Wuye to acknowledge her? ] ”

[ F * ck! Is Cen Wuye so scheming? ]

[ I feel like I’m watching a large-scale palace drama! ]

“[ the analysis above makes sense. It’s obvious that this photo is my handiwork. Unfortunately, her wishful thinking is wrong! After all, Cen Wuye only wants to follow her, while she wants to be intimate with him. ] ”

“Seeing that the direction of the comments was developing according to her imagination, song Chenyu curled the corners of her lips and moved her fingers. Soon, new hot searches flooded in. ”

# scheming woman explodes to the top! #

# Country 2’s hot female lead is suspected to be kept as a mistress #

# Country 2’s shady business #

“For a time, the entire Weibo hot search page was taken over by Ye Zhuo. ”

“[ ye fans, don’t be anxious, and don’t be led astray! I believe that Ye Zi isn’t that kind of person! Wait for Ye Zi’s official announcement! ] ”

[ wait for the official announcement! ]

[ NC fans are NC fans. Don’t you know who Cen Wuye is? He just opened his mouth and announced the official announcement! I’m just a small streamer. Is she worthy? ]

-LSB- official announcemeYouryour master is about to be dumped by a big financier! ]

[ scheming woman is really shameless. Cen Wuye is obviously a man who doesn’t want to get married. She really wants to use public opinion to force Cen Wuye to admit their relationship. Does she really think Cen Wuye is that easy to manipulate? ]

Ye Zhuo was choosing evening gowns for the press conference. She did not know that she was already trending.

“Just as she changed into her evening gowns, she received a text message from CEN Shaoqing. ”

[ I’m already at your door. ]

“Ye Zhuo replied, [ I’m on my way. ] ”

“After replying to the text, Ye Zhuo went to the door. ” Nnêw n0vel chapters are published on n0v/e/(lb)i(n.)co/m

“Cen Shaoqing was leaning against the car door waiting for her. When he saw her coming over, he immediately opened the car door. “Leader, Please.” ”

Ye Zhuo leaned into the car.

“Very soon, the car arrived at the press conference. ”

Cen Shaoqing went to the other side and opened the car door. He extended his hand that was holding the Buddhist beads to her. “How long will it take you to finish the press conference?”

“”About 15 minutes,”ye Zhuo answered. ”

Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips parted slightly. “Then I’ll wait for you at the door.”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“At this moment, countless reporters suddenly swarmed over, surrounding Cen Shaoqing and ye Zhuo in the middle. ”

“”Cen Fifth Master, Miss Ye, may I ask what do the two of you think of the Weibo Trending Incident?” ”

Ye Zhuo was stunned.

She was trending?

When did it happen?

“The reporter then passed the microphone to CEN Shaoqing and said, “CEN fifth master, the trending topic revealed that you and Miss Ye are lovers. May I ask if you and miss ye are boyfriend and girlfriend?” ”

“No.”Cen Shaoqing shook his head slightly.

No.

As expected.

How could a man like Cen Shaoqing fall for a small streamer?

Wasn’t this a fantasy?

The reporters looked at each other in dismay. They could see the expression in each other’s eyes that they wanted to see.

“Song Chenyu was standing opposite the two of them. When she heard Cen Shaoqing say ‘no’without hesitation, her eyes were filled with joy. ”

This answer had long been within her expectations.

“Although ye Zhuo was somewhat beautiful, he was too young. Now that he had used a method to expose her and Cen Shaoqing’s relationship, it would be strange if Cen Shaoqing fell in love with her! ”

She did not even look at herself in the mirror to see what kind of person she was!

“Just as the reporters were about to ask the next more incisive question, Cen Shaoqing turned his head to look at the camera, he continued, “To be precise, I’m still in the internship period. When my family’s leader finishes his inspection, I’ll be able to become a full-time official and officially become a certified boyfriend.” ”
