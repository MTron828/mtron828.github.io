Chapter 99: 075: Heal and save, brother and sister meeting 6

The housekeeper had already ordered people to prepare a rich lunch.

After working for five hours without a drop of water, Ye Zao was indeed hungry, so he did not refuse. “Where’s My Friend?”

The housekeeper said, “I’ve already sent someone to invite Miss Lin. Please have your meal first.”

“Okay.”

Soon, Lin Sha came over.

“How’s Burning?”

Ye Zao smiled and said, “Very successful.”

Lin Shasha said excitedly, “Burning, you’re really amazing!”

After a while, grandfather Yang and Sun Fulian also came and prepared a generous reward.

Even Lin Shasha had a gift.

Ye Zao did not refuse, “Grandfather Yang, you must take the medicine on time. You haven’t fully recovered yet, so don’t let your guard down.”

Grandpa Yang nodded. “Okay.”

When they arrived at the hotel, Lin Sha opened the gift that Grandpa Yang had prepared and widened her eyes in surprise. “This, this is the BL Baoyue limited edition bracelet!”

BL Baoyue was a famous luxury brand.

This limited edition bracelet was sold for six figures!

Ye Zao glanced at it. “I think so. I still have a watch and necklace here.”

“F * ck! I Can’t Take It! It’s too expensive!”Lin Sha pushed the bracelet in front of Ye Zhuo.

Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “Sister Sha Sha, Grandpa Yang gave it to you. Why are you giving it to me?”

Lin Sha said, “Grandpa Yang gave it to you to thank you for curing him! I Can’t Take It! I’ve seen this bracelet on the internet before. It’s more than 200,000 yuan!”If she had known that the gifts prepared by the Yang family were so expensive.., there’s no way Lindsay would take it.

After all, she didn’t do anything.

Instead of doing anything, she ate a lot of delicious food.

Ye Zhuo continued, “Sister Sha Sha, since Grandpa Yang gave it to you, you should take it. If you return it now, people will think that you are looking down on their gift, and it will backfire.”

“Ah?”Lin Shasha didn’t think of that at all, “Will it still be like this? But I didn’t do anything. Even if I can’t return this bracelet to Grandpa Yang, I can’t take it. Zhuozhuo, the owner of this bracelet should be you.”

Ye Zhuo nodded very seriously and then comforted Lin Shasha, “Sister Shasha, you are doing me the greatest favor by accompanying me to the Yang family. If you didn’t accompany me, I wouldn’t go to the Yang family alone.”

“Really?”Lin Shasha asked.

“Really.”Ye Zhuo nodded.

After much persuasion, Lin Shasha finally accepted the bracelet.

The two of them made an appointment online to go to the night market nearby.

Although it had snowed during the day, it was more enjoyable to go to the night market during the snow.

..

On the other side.

The Lin family.

As usual, Feng Qianhua came to deliver the health-preserving soup to Old Lady Lin.

After the old lady drank the health-preserving soup, she went to sleep.

Feng Qianhua turned around and went outside the house. She instructed the servants to clean the house gently so as not to disturb Old Lady Lin’s rest.

The servants nodded respectfully.

Who Was Feng Qianhua?

In the hearts of the servants of the Lin family, Feng Qianhua was the future mistress of the family, the mistress of the house!

And Feng Qianhua was also putting on the airs of the mistress of the house!

She was very good at commanding the servants. She was even more imposing than the Feng family.

“Miss Qianhua, have some tea.”Aunt Zhang brought a cup of tea.

Feng Qianhua smiled and took the tea that Aunt Zhang passed to her.

Aunt Zhang took the opportunity to whisper a few words in Feng Qianhua’s ear.

Feng Qianhua’s expression changed. She put down the cup and walked out of the door.

Aunt Zhang immediately followed.

The two of them came to a rockery in the back garden of the Lin family.

Feng qianhua frowned and said, “Are you sure that’s what Lin Ze told the Old Lady?”

Aunt Zhang nodded. “I heard it with my own ears.”

Feng Qianhua’s frown deepened.

This child, Lin Ze, was a natural ingrate.

When she was very young, her heart ached for that child who did not have a biological mother. She wanted to take a sip of milk from Feng Xianxian and give it to Lin Ze.

But Lin Ze would rather drink the milk powder than take a sip!

All these years, she had poured her heart and soul into Lin Ze and tried her best to please him!

But Lin ze actually said that everyone could be his stepmother, except for her.

As expected, it was true to that saying.

No matter how she raised someone else’s child, she would not be able to properly raise it!

She had treated Lin ze so well, but in the end, Lin Ze had repaid her kindness with enmity and turned around to bite her back.

What an ingrate!

Aunt Zhang looked around and continued, “It seems that if you want to marry into the Lin family, you can’t take the path of Lin Ze.”

“You don’t have to tell me that. I know.”In the past, Feng Qianhua had treated Lin ze as the stepping stone for her to marry into the Lin family. Now that this stepping stone had its own ideas, it naturally couldn’t be used.
