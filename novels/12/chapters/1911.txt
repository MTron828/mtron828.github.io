“”Second brother, do you know what Shuyi has done?”Li Sanzhu looked at Li Erzhu with extreme pain. ”

“Li Erzhu vaguely felt that something was wrong and continued, “Where is Shuyi?” ”

Li Sanzhu did not say anything.

“Linda continued, “Where is Cen Wuye? I want Cen Wuye to give us an explanation. He must be responsible for Shuyi!” ”

“Fang yinyue frowned. “Second sister-in-law, do you really not know what happened? Shuyi was taken away by the Police!” ”

What!

Li Shuyi was actually taken away by the police.

“Hearing this, Linda stared at Fang yinyue with her eyes wide open, unable to react in time. ”

“Fang yinyue continued, “Second sister-in-law, don’t embarrass yourself here. Quickly go to the police station to look for Shuyi! Shuyi is a girl after all. If her reputation is ruined, how will she be able to live in the future?” ”

What exactly happened?

It was clearly Cen Shaoqing who slept with Li Shuyi. How did it become that Li Shuyi was the one who embarrassed herself?

Something was wrong.

This was very wrong.

“What exactly happened?”Linda asked.

Fang yinyue frowned and told Linda what happened.

“Hearing this, Li Erzhu and Linda frowned deeply. The color on their faces disappeared completely. ”

How could this be?

“Without delay, the couple hurried to the police station. Under the guidance of the police, the two of them went to hire a lawyer for Li Shuyi. However, when the slightly famous lawyer heard that the other party was Li Shuyi, his face turned pale with fear, no matter how much money Li Erzhu and Linda offered, they were not willing to accept this case. ”

“In desperation, the couple could only entrust their relatives and friends in C country to find a lawyer for Li Shuyi in C country. ”

“Li Shuyi was not married yet, and she was so outstanding. They must not leave behind any criminal records. ”

On the other side.

Cen Shaoqing came to Ye Zao’s room.

“Ye Zao was sitting in front of the computer, his ten fingers rapidly jumping on the black keyboard, crackling. ”

“In the room, other than the sound of the keyboard, there was no other sound. ”

“When Cen Shaoqing came in, Ye Zao had just finished the work in his hands. He raised his eyebrows and said, “It’s so late, why are you here?” ”

“I want to squeeze with you tonight.”Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips opened slightly.

“”Why?”Ye Zhuo asked curiously, “Why can’t you stay in Your Room?” ”

“It’s dirty.”Cen Shaoqing said concisely.

“Ye Zhuo smiled. “If it’s dirty, find a guest room to sleep in. I only have one bed here.” ”

Cen Shaoqing’s tone was low. “Because it’s because of you.”

“Me?”Ye Zao asked doubtfully.

“”Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. He leaned over to Ye Zao’s side and said in a low voice, “I’m keeping myself as a jade for you.” ”

“His voice was originally low and somewhat hoarse. At this moment, his deliberately lowered voice made people unable to stop and unable to stop him. ”

“Ye Zao was stunned for a moment. When he looked back, his red lips brushed past his thin lips. ”

“Unlike before, he had always been cold and restrained, but now, his lips were boiling hot. ”

Only then did ye Zao notice that his face was redder than usual.

“What’s wrong? Are you not feeling well?”Ye Zao asked.

Cen Shaoqing’s Adam’s apple rolled. “I was drugged.”

“What?”

Cen Shaoqing repeated it again.

Only then did ye Zao hear it clearly. A faint light flashed in his eyes. “Who?”

“”I forgot what it’s called.”CEN Shaoqing continued, “It should be a relative of your classmate.” ”

Li Yueyue’s relative?

Could It Be Li Shuyi.

“At this moment, there was a knock on the door. ”

“”Wait a moment, I’ll go open the door first.” ”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

Ye Zhuo walked over to open the door.

“The moment he opened the door, he saw Li Yueyue. ”

“Yueyue.”

“Li Yueyue said, “Great Zao, is it convenient for you to Talk Now?” ”

“”Yes, tell me.”Ye Zao nodded slightly and continued, “But hurry up, there are still people waiting in the house.” ” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“”Okay.”Li Yueyue first expressed her apology and then told ye Zao what happened, “Zao Zao, don’t worry, I’m not here to plead for Li Shuyi. I just feel sorry for you guys...”anyway, she was quite embarrassed. ”

“After all, ye Zhonghua and Cen Shaoqing lived in his house, and Li Shuyi was her cousin. ”

“No matter what, this matter was definitely related to her. ”

“Ye Zhonghua’s tone was clear and shallow. Although this matter had indeed made her quite angry, she did not blame Li Yueyue. ”

“Fortunately, CEN Shaoqing did not fall for it. ”

“Otherwise, she would have died of guilt. ”

“”This matter has nothing to do with you, Yueyue. You Don’t have to blame yourself,”ye Zhonghua said. ”

“Li Yueyue held ye Zao’s hands and said, “I’m really sorry, Great Zao.” ”

“After saying a few words to Li Yueyue, ye Zao returned to his room. ”

“Cen Shaoqing drank two bottles of ice water in a row and felt a little better. When he looked back, he saw ye Zao walking over. ”

Everything was back to square one.

“As a doctor, ye Zao naturally knew that this feeling was not good. He took out the medical kit and took out a pill and handed it to Cen Shaoqing. “You’ll feel better after eating it.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing took the pill, twirled the Buddhist beads, and said, “I’m doing this for you. Are you really not going to give yourself to me?” ”

“”Sure, let’s see if you have the guts.” ”

“As soon as he finished speaking, ye Zao began to Unbutton his shirt. ”

“One Pill, two pills. ”

“Seeing that ye Zao did not seem to be joking, Cen Shaoqing immediately turned around. “Stop fooling around, quickly put it on!” ”

His voice was low and hoarse.

“Ye Zhuo chuckled and said, “I thought you had a lot of guts.” ”

Cen Shaoqing swallowed the pill and silently took this debt to heart.

There was still plenty of time in the future.

“One day, he would demand it back with interest. ”

“After a moment, Cen Shaoqing turned around and looked at Ye Zhuo. “Give me another pill.” ”

“What?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“”A pill,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly. “Do you think it’s a sugar pill? A normal person can just take one.”

Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads and enunciated each word. “I’m more powerful.”

More powerful?

How was he more powerful?

“When his gaze landed on a certain someone’s abdomen, ye Zao’s face inexplicably turned red. ”

...

Changyue country.

Qiu Di sat in front of his office desk.

“Ye Han took out a compressed space box. “Young miss, this is what you wanted.” ”

“”Open it,”Qiu di said. ”

Ye Han entered the password and successfully opened the compressed space box.

Qiu Di took a look and memorized the password.

“In a moment, ye Han took out a black battle suit from the black box. “This is the battle suit that ye Zao wore when he was alive.” ”

“Ye Han! You Traitor!”
