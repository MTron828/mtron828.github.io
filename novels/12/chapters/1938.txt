“Soon, the music in the carriage changed to another one with a dramatic tone. ”

“Song Shiyu continued, “I want to listen to all the songs between the mountains and the water, as well as all the songs of this singer.” ”

“”Between the mountains and the water?”Tian Zihao didn’t expect song Shiyu to suddenly order a song. He asked, “Third brother, is it the mountains and water painting?” ”

“Yes.”Song Shiyu nodded slightly.

“Is it sung by Xu Hao?”Tian Zihao asked again.

“Song Shiyu leaned against the back of the chair and said, “Then it’s sung by song, not Hao.” ”

Tian Zihao’s face turned red and he was a little embarrassed.

He was careless.

He was careless.

“Soon, the carriage was filled with lyrics between the mountains and rivers. ”

“Tian Zihao specifically went online to search for information about this singer, he then said, “Third brother, this singer is quite amazing. He composed all the lyrics and songs by himself. Moreover, a song called ‘Thousand Baidu’has been selected into the university textbook.” ”

“He originally thought that song Shiyu would talk freely because of this, but he did not expect song Shiyu to just acknowledge him and not speak anymore. ”

Tian zihao frowned slightly.

“Could it be that he misunderstood? Song Shiyu did not like this singer, but simply liked listening to his songs? ”

Don’t guess what the Big Boss is thinking!

“Tian zihao glanced at Bai Jiayu, who was beside him. Bai Jiayu was also a little confused. ”

He didn’t realize before that song Shiyu liked listening to songs.

“Soon, the car arrived at song Shiyu’s apartment. ”

“Chen Siyao was already waiting at the apartment. When she saw the three of them return, she immediately greeted them with a smile. “Shiyu, you’re back. I made you your favorite ginger and brown sugar water.” ”

“Okay.”Song Shiyu acknowledged.

“Although it was just a simple word, it made Chen Siyao very excited because at least song Shiyu wasn’t ignoring her. ”

“”I’ll go get it for you,”Chen Siyao continued. ”

“Seeing Chen Siyao like this, Tian Zihao was a little speechless. “My cousin is like this. As long as she sees third brother, she can’t see anyone else. She doesn’t even say she’ll get us something.” ”

Bai Jiayu shrugged. “I’m already used to it anyway.”

Chen Siyao was always like this.

“No matter how song Shiyu treated her, she would always smile in response. ”

“Very soon, Chen Siyao came over with ginger brown sugar water. ”

But only Bai Jiayu and Tian Zihao were sitting in the living room. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Chen Siyao frowned slightly. “Where’s Shiyu?”

“Bai Jiayu said, “He went upstairs.” ”

“At that moment, Song Shiyu changed into a new set of home clothes and walked down from upstairs. In his arms... ... was a chubby cat. ”

A cat?

Chen Siyao even thought that her eyes were playing tricks on her.

Song Shiyu was actually carrying a cat?

“Chen Siyao had been bitten by a cat when she was young and was allergic to cat fur, so she had always been afraid of cats. Seeing this, she took a few steps back. ”

“Bai Jiayu had seen this cat before, so he wasn’t very curious. However, he still asked in surprise, “This cat isn’t Dead Yet?”Song Shiyu had never raised a cat before, and he had a bad temper, cats were the kind of animals that were especially good at acting coquettishly and needed someone to take care of them. Bai Jiayu thought that this cat had died a long time ago! ”

“He didn’t expect that not only did it not die, but it had even become fatter. ”

“Don’t worry.”Song Shiyu raised his head and looked at Bai Jiayu. “It won’t die even if you die.”

“Hearing that, Bai Jiayu smiled and said, “Third brother, I’m your best brother. You actually said that about me because of a cat.” ”

Song Shiyu looked at him with a cold gaze and did not say anything.

Bai Jiayu immediately shut up and changed the topic. “This cat is so cute. What’s its name?”

“”Mimi,”song Shiyu replied. ”

Bai Jiayu was a little speechless. “You call that a name?”

“”Mimi song,”song Shiyu replied. ”

“”Alright, I’ll just call it a name, but the chances of having the same name are too high!”Bai Jiayu looked at Chen Siyao and smiled. “Siyao, why are you standing so far away? Cats aren’t Tigers!” ”

A stiff smile appeared on Chen Siyao’s face. “It’s nothing.”

“Tian zihao said, “My cousin has been afraid since she was young...” ”

“Before he could finish his sentence, Chen Siyao interrupted him. “Cousin, aren’t you going back? Auntie was already urging you!” ”

Tian Zihao knew Chen Siyao’s intentions and glanced at her helplessly.

Silly Girl!

“In his eyes, Chen Siyao was a silly girl from head to toe. Was it really worth it to do this for someone who would never fall in love with him? ”

“”Then I’ll go back first.”Tian Zihao stood up from the sofa. “Third brother, Jiayu, I’ll go back first.” ”

“Okay.”Song Shiyu nodded slightly.

Bai Jiayu stood up to send Tian Zihao off.
