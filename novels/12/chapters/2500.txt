Yu sunset smiled and shook his head.

He began to sympathize with Cen Shaoqing.

“Looking for such a troublesome girlfriend, he did not know how Cen Shaoqing usually got by. ”

“After a moment, ye Zhuo put down the cutlery and continued, “I’m done eating.” ”

“Why are you so fast?”Yu sunset was stunned.

“Ye Zhuo said, “I came earlier than you.” ”

“After saying that, ye Zao turned around and left. After taking a few steps, she seemed to have thought of something and stopped. She looked back slightly and her gaze landed on Yu Mumu. She slowly said, “Yu Mumu.” ”

“What’s Wrong?”Yu Mumu asked.

“Ye Zao’s red lips parted slightly. “In the end, you still underestimated Xian ‘er.” ”

“Yu Mumu laughed out loud. “You overestimated her. Your taste in men is indeed good, but your taste in women is still a little lacking.” ”

Ye Zhuo did not say anything else and continued to turn around and leave. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Yu Mumu looked at ye Zhuo’s back and shook his head helplessly. Sometimes, blind confidence was not necessarily a good thing. ”

Ye Zhuo was just too confident.

Baiyun residence.

“Song Shiyu was lying on the bed. His entire body was in unbearable pain. Not only was his face pale, even his lips were deathly pale. There was not even a hint of blood. ”

“”Boss, I’ll go get Doctor Liu.” ”

Song Shiyu shook his head. “There’s no need. It’s under normal circumstances...”

A long illness turned into a medical condition.

Song Shiyu knew his body’s condition very well.

The assistant was still a little worried. “Is there really no need?”

“There’s really no need.”Song Shiyu pressed his temples. “You can go out first.”

The assistant could only walk out of the door.

“Seeing that the door was closed, Song Shiyu’s expression eased up a little. ”

“A moment later, he lifted the blanket and got out of bed. ”

“Although it was very uncomfortable, bedridden was not his style. ”

“Soon, song Shiyu went to the bathroom and began to wash up. ”

“After getting dressed, although his face was still a little pale, it was much better than before. ”

“Just as he walked into the dining room, the secretary came over with a document in her arms. “Boss, there’s an emergency video conference in half an hour.” ”

“Got it.”

Song Shiyu sat at the dining table and started eating the nutritious and healthy breakfast that doctor Liu had prepared for him.

“Since it was a nutritious breakfast, it definitely didn’t taste good. ”

“After breakfast, there were still ten minutes before the video conference. ”

“At this moment, Song Shiyu received a wechat message. ”

It was from an Lizi.

She had invited him to play games.

“Whether it was an Lizi, Li Yueyue, or Zhao Pingting, song Shiyu had never rejected their game invitations. ”

This time was no exception.

“After clicking ‘agree’, song Shiyu turned to look at his secretary. “I suddenly have something very important to take care of. The video conference will be postponed for three hours.” ”

The Secretary was stunned.

“It was almost time for the meeting. If it was suddenly postponed, it would be hard to explain to the directors. ”

“Don’t you understand what I’m saying?”Song Shiyu raised his eyes slightly and looked at his assistant.

The assistant immediately reacted and nodded. “Okay.”

Song Shiyu took his phone back to the study.

“He was wearing headphones, so he couldn’t hear the sound of the game, but he could occasionally hear the sound of him communicating with his teammates. ”

“Li Yueyue was cut three times by the monkey opposite her in a row. She said exasperatedly, “Is there something wrong with the monkey opposite you? Is it interesting to keep staring at the auxiliary cut?” ”

“An lizi smiled and said, “Do you have a crush on You?” ”

“”Of course. Otherwise, why would he keep cutting you?”Zhao Pingting echoed. ”

An Lizi couldn’t help but laugh. “I also think that the monkey must have a crush on Yueyue!”

“”He has a crush on a hammer,”Li Yueyue continued, “D * mn it! If only it were burning, I would beat him until he kneels on the ground and calls me daddy!” ”

“If he really took a fancy to her, he wouldn’t chase after her and slash her! ”

“After all, she was just a support. It was meaningless for monkey to target her. ”

“At this moment, Song Shiyu’s voice came from the earpiece, “Follow me next time.” ”

“”Okay,”Li Yueyue continued, “Mr. Song is still reliable. He’s not like those two useless chickens who only know how to Eat Melons.” ”

“After being resurrected, Li Yueyue followed behind song Shiyu. ”

Monkey continued cutting her as usual.

“But this time, monkey was directly cut by song Shiyu. ”

“”Big Brother, you’re cheating!” ”

“666!”

“Song Shiyu continued, “Li Yueyue.” ”

“Yes.”

“Song Shiyu continued, “Didn’t you ask me to keep an eye out for high-quality youths last time?” ”

“Li Yueyue said in surprise, “There’s a result already?” ”

“Yes.”

“Li Yueyue said, “Who is it? Is he handsome? How Old is he this year?” ”

An Lizi and Zhao pingting were also very curious.
