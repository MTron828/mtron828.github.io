Translator: 549690339

“Thinking of this, Tang Xue’s heart skipped a beat. ”

She had had people stare at ye Zao for such a long time. She did not expect that a problem would appear at such a critical moment!

It was intentional.

Ye Zao was doing it on purpose.

“She had been staring at ye Zao for a week. There was nothing unusual about ye Zao during this week, yet he had lost his whereabouts at this time. It was obvious that he wanted to catch her off guard. ”

She had underestimated ye Zao after all.

Tang Xue narrowed her eyes.

“”SIS, why aren’t you saying anything!”Bai Yun tugged at Tang Xue’s sleeve. “What do you think will happen if ye Zao really runs away?” ”

“She was still waiting to be promoted to the management level. Then, she would get ye Zao to bring her tea and water. She would humiliate ye Zao and avenge her past humiliation! ”

“Now That Ye Zao had run away, how was she going to avenge her past humiliation? ”

Bai Yun felt a little uncomfortable.

“Sit down first.”Tang Xue stood up. “I’m going out to take a look.”

“Bai Yun nodded. “Sis, you must get ye Zao Back!” ”

Tang Xue did not say a word and walked out.

Bai Yun looked at Tang Xue’s back and was very anxious.

“Just as she walked out, Tang Xue took out her phone and called her assistant. ”

“The call was quickly connected, ”

“Miss Tang.”

“Tang Xue said, “Where’s Ye Zao? I told you to keep an eye on her. Where did you see her? The aircraft carrier launch ceremony is in two hours. Why is ye Zao Missing!” ”

“The assistant was also very anxious at this moment. “Miss Tang, I don’t know what’s going on either! She was clearly still within our line of sight half an hour ago. I didn’t expect her to disappear now!” ”

“”Trash! You’re all a bunch of trash!”Tang Xue’s face was full of anger. “Immediately arrange for people to go to all the major airports and high-speed railway stations to stand guard! If you find any suspicious people, immediately control them and call me!” ”

“”Okay, Miss Tang, I’ll go and handle it immediately.” ”

“Ye Zao couldn’t stay in Hua anymore. If she escaped, she would definitely leave the country! ”

“After some thought, Tang Xue gave another call to her classmates who were in the process of leaving the country. ” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“After making the call, Tang Xue walked towards the preparation area. ”

“Miss Tang!”Xiaolu walked towards her.

Tang Xue nodded.

“Xiaolu continued, “Miss Tang, did ye Zao Run Away?” ”

“Yes.”

“Xiaolu smiled and said, “Miss Tang, this might be a good thing for you.” ”

“What do you mean?”Tang Xue turned to look at Xiao Lu.

“Xiao Lu said, “Ye Zhuo can run away, but a monk can’t run away. She has signed a gambling agreement with C Nation, Country L, and five other countries. Even if she runs away, the international side will send people to capture her! At that time, the one who will lose face will still be her. Also, the aircraft carrier launch ceremony will be held soon. If ye Zhuo doesn’t appear soon, the higher-ups will definitely issue a global arrest warrant for her. Unless she changes her appearance, otherwise, there is no place for her to hide in this world!” ”

Did Ye Zao have the ability to change her appearance?

“Hearing this, the corners of Tang Xue’s lips curled up. ”

Xiao Lu’s words made a lot of sense.

“The person that ye Zao offended now was not just her, but the entire international department. ”

“Even if ye Zao ran away now, he would be captured by the international department in a while. ”

“In front of the global audience, Ye Zao was handcuffed and brought back by the International Department. When that time came, the scene would definitely be very exciting! ”

He was really looking forward to it more and more.

“”You’re right,”Tang Xue continued, “Xiao Lu, spread the news of ye Zao’s disappearance now.”It would be best if the matter became bigger and the international department was personally involved. ”

“”Okay.”Xiao Lu nodded and said with a smile, “I’ll do it right away.” ”

“Okay.”Tang Xue nodded.

“After Xiao Lu left, Tang Xue called her assistant and asked her assistant to withdraw all the people who were following and investigating ye Zao. ”

“After doing these things, Tang Xue walked to the preparation cabin. ”

“In the preparation cabin, Cen Jiang, Cen he, Cen Hu, and Cen Hai were preparing for the launch ceremony of the aircraft carrier. ”

Tang Xue looked down at the four brothers with a sarcastic smile on her face.

“”Cen Jiang,”said Tang Xue. ”

“Cen Jiang said without raising his head, “I’m sorry, Tang Gong, we’re very busy right now and don’t have time to entertain you. Please excuse us.” ”

Worker Tang.

“Hearing this title, Tang Xue Only felt that it was ironic. ”

“Before ye Zao came to the base, everyone had called her Miss Tang. The four brothers of Jianghe, Huhai also affectionately called her sister Xue. ”

And Now?

“Ever since ye Zao appeared, those who used to call her miss tang all called her worker Tang. ”

Fortunately.

“Fortunately, the heavenly axiom had a cycle of reincarnation. ”

“Now, it was finally ye Zao’s turn to get his retribution! ”

She will laugh to see Ye Zhuo Cry!
