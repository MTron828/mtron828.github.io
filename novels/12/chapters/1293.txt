“Zhou xiang smiled and said, “Isn’t big sister here?”Zhou Xiang did not want to take up this hot potato. ”

Her stepmother was too ambitious.

She regarded Zheng Wanyin as more of a fairy than a fairy.

“She was afraid that no matter which family she was introduced to, she would not be satisfied. ”

“Why?”Xie wanqiu slammed the table. “Just because yinyin is not your biological niece?”

“”Mom, that’s not what I meant.” ”

“”Then what do you mean?”Xie wanqiu said, “You’re her second aunt, so you have to be responsible for yinyin!” ”

“Zhou Xiang rolled his eyes. “Nowadays, young people are all interested in free love. Besides, yinyin is so beautiful and eloquent. What kind of family can you not find? There’s no need for me to be superfluous.” ”

Xie wanqiu was rather satisfied with these words.

“Of course, her yinyin was outstanding. She was many times more outstanding than the Zhou family! ”

“Unlike this Zhou Xiang, she was simply extremely stupid. ”

“She had already said so much, yet Zhou Xiang still did not know her intentions. Did she have to say it out loud? ”

It was not like her yinyin could not get married!

Why did she have to send herself to her door?

“Xie wanqiu continued, “Let’s not talk about yinyin for now. Let’s talk about other things!” ”

“Okay.”Zhou Xiang nodded.

“Xie wanqiu said, “You know that I hate black the most. Why is your house decorated in black and gray? Aren’t you deliberately making things difficult for me? Just because I’m not your biological mother?” ”

“”No, in my heart, you’ve always been my biological mother.”Zhou xiang hurriedly explained, “The style of decoration here is my mother...” ”

“Whose mother? Your Mother? When did I let you decorate the house like this? !”

“Before Zhou Xiang could finish her sentence, Xie Wanqiu interrupted her. ”

“Not you. I’m talking about my mother-in-law.”

“Xie wanqiu snorted coldly. “So in your heart, I’m not even comparable to a mother-in-law.” ”

Zhou Xiang’s fate was too good.

“Once she married into the Cen family, she became a rich lady. She had a husband who doted on her, and she had five outstanding children. ”

“Most importantly, even the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law were getting along so well. ”

“On the first few days of Zhou Xiang and Cen Haifeng’s marriage, Xie Wanqiu had been hoping that Zhou Xiang and the Cen Old Lady would have a feud. After all, this rich family had deep waters. ”

“As long as the Cen family disliked Zhou Xiang, then her biological daughter would have a chance to rise to the top. ”

“Unexpectedly, Zhou Xiang was a fool who had dumb luck. The CEN old lady not only did not dislike Zhou Xiang, but instead treated Zhou Xiang as her biological daughter. ”

Decades passed like days.

“Gradually, Xie wanqiu also gave up on this idea. ”

“”Mom, it’s not like that...”Zhou Xiang did not know how to explain. ”

“Xie wanqiu continued, “Since it’s not like that, then we’ll completely renovate this manor, according to the style that I like.” ”

“”This, I’m afraid that’s not very good.”Zhou Xiang continued, “You should know that I’ve never made the decision at home.” ”

“”Since you don’t make the decisions, then I’ll make the decisions for you today!” ”

“Coincidentally, that damned old woman from the Cen family was not at home during this period of time. By the time she returned, the renovation had already been completed! ”

Xie Wanqiu’s purpose for coming to the CEN family this time was very simple.

To occupy the mountain and become the king.

“She wanted to let everyone in the Cen family know that in this family, she had weight. ”

She was a man of her word.

Another reason was Zheng Wanyin. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Zheng Wanyin was the favored daughter of the heavens.

This favored daughter of the heavens deserved to be matched with the favored son of the heavens.

“Other than the favored son of the heavens, no one else was worthy of Zheng Wanyin! ”

Xie Wanqiu’s wishful thinking was cracking loudly.

Zhou Xiang felt like his head was about to explode. “This isn’t appropriate.”

“”You’re already calling me mom. What’s not appropriate about this?”Xie wanqiu looked at Zhou Xiang. “Don’t tell me that as a mom, I can’t even make decisions for My Daughter?” ”

“Just as Zhou Xiang was in a dilemma, old Mrs. Cen walked in from outside. “When did an outsider like you get to make decisions for the Cen Family?” ”

Bai Tang?

Why did this damn old woman come back?

Didn’t she go on a trip?

“When she saw Old Mrs. Cen, Xie Wanqiu narrowed her eyes and immediately changed her expression, she smiled and said, “Elder sister, you’re back! You’ve misunderstood. I just suggested that Xiangxiang renovate the house. Since you don’t like it, then forget it. I’m just saying anyway.” ”

“The person that old Mrs. Cen hated the most was Xie wanqiu. She said unceremoniously, “I think you’re Aristotle’s second aunt. You’re so F * cking troublesome! Why are you still playing the old cucumber painting trick in front of me!” ”
