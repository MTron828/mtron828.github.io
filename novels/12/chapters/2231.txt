“After Bai Jingshu returned, she watered the plants in the house. Then, she instructed the housekeeper to come once a day to feed the kittens. Only then did she leave with peace of mind. ”

“After spending three days in Beijing, Shi Qingcheng could not bear to go back. ”

“Although the s galaxy was prosperous and technologically advanced, compared to Earth, the s galaxy still lacked a lot of resources. ”

“Sear Sear.”Shi Qingcheng hugged ye Sear’s arm. “Now I finally know why you didn’t return to the S Galaxy!”

Ye sear smiled faintly. “Why? You Can’t bear to go back?”

“Yes.”Shi Qingcheng nodded slightly. “I’ve decided that I want to set up a small home in the capital city in the future.”

“Hearing this, Ye Sear seemed to have thought of something. He pulled open the drawer of the desk, took out a bunch of keys, and handed them to Shi Qingcheng. ”

“What’s This?”Shi Qingcheng asked.

“Ye Zao said, “It’s a small courtyard house near the East Ring Road. It’s a dowry for you.” ”

“F * ck! Is this for real?”Shi Qingcheng asked.

“”It’s true.”Ye Zao smiled and said, “But no one has lived there for a long time. If you want to live there, you’ll have to find someone to design and renovate it.” ”

“”No problem,”Shi Qingcheng said, “I like renovations the most! Zao Zao, I Love You!” ”

“After understanding the capital for the past few days, Shi Qingcheng also wanted to buy a house, but the houses here were too expensive, and the star currency of the s galaxy could not be exchanged here, so Shi Qingcheng had no choice but to give up on this idea. ”

Ye searing was simply a timely rain for her.

S galaxy.

“Today was elder Bai’s 90th birthday, so many people were invited. ”

“Elder Bai didn’t lack anything, so Bai Jingshu wrote a birthday toast for him. ”

“She was an author, after all, so her handwriting was very beautiful, and she won everyone’s approval on the spot. ”

“The eldest daughter of the Bai family is really amazing! She has the heart of a orchid!”

“Bai Jingshu wore a red gown and stood in the middle of the crowd, thanking him politely. ”

“If it weren’t for the special circumstances, she definitely wouldn’t have been able to handle such a situation. ”

“If she had known that a single word would cause so many people to sigh, she would definitely have secretly gifted it to her grandfather. ”

As long as she had the intention.

“”Momo, look at her! She’s acting all pretentious!”Bai Yuanyuan and Bai Jingshu had never gotten along well, at this moment, when she saw that Bai Jingshu was like a star worshipping the moon, she felt a little uncomfortable. “If it wasn’t for the injury on your hand, how could she be the one to present the treasure in front of grandfather!” ”

“Bai Mo glanced in that direction, but his expression didn’t change. “Why bother with her? It’s not easy for her to make a move.” ”

It wasn’t that Bai Mo looked down on Bai Jingshu.

It was that Bai Jingshu was too useless to help herself.

“As the eldest daughter of the Bai family’s eldest daughter, Bai Jingshu’s starting point wasn’t low. It was a pity that she had played a good hand of cards to a pulp. ”

“Bai Jingshu didn’t have the grace of a famous family’s eldest daughter. Not only did she not have any advantages, but she spent her days on a low-grade planet like Earth. Others avoided her as much as possible, but she.., two-thirds of her time was wasted on Earth. ”

She did not want to progress!

“Hearing this, Bai Yuanyuan smiled and said, “That’s true. Why bother with people like her?” ”

“After saying that, Bai Yuanyuan continued, “By the way, I heard that Ye Han and Shi Qingcheng are together. Do you know that?” ”

“Is that so?”Bai Mo asked.

“Bai Yuanyuan nodded. “If you ask me, other than the fact that Qingcheng is a little taller than you, she really doesn’t look like you. I wonder how ye Han fell in love with her!” ”

“Bai Mo said, “Everyone has their own favorites.” ”

Her current target was no longer ye Han.

That was because another celebrity was already rising.

“Does Manwen have a fiancée?”Bai Mo turned to look at Bai Yuanyuan.

Yes.

It was Manwen!

“After this incident, Bai Mo realized that Manwen was a talent that could be molded. ”

“In the future, Manwen’s achievements would be far more than that. ”

“Bai Yuanyuan shook her head. “I don’t think so. However, I feel that Manwen seems to have some interest in Bai Jingshu.” ”

Bai Mo frowned slightly. “Why do you say that?”

“”Didn’t Manwen have a bad reputation before? There weren’t many people in the s galaxy who were friends with him. Now, Bai Jingshu had picked up on his mistakes! If you ask me, she really is a fool who has luck! I heard that Manwen even invited Bai Jingshu to the presidential palace as a guest!” ”

“Hearing that, Bai Mo’s frown deepened. ”

“With that said, Bai Jingshu did indeed have some luck. ”

“”I remember, wasn’t there someone who had been chasing after Bai Jingshu?”Although Bai Jingshu did not have much of a presence in the Bai family, she was good-looking, so she did not lack suitors. ”

“”There seems to be one,”Bai Yuanyuan said. ”

Bai Mo narrowed his eyes. “Then let’s help him.”

“How?”Bai Yuanyuan asked.

A smile appeared on Bai Mo’s face. “Help him get Bai Jingshu.”
