Translator: 549690339

Cen Shaoqing did not notice that Baylor was missing.

He was looking for a toy for Baylor.

“At this moment, he saw Baylor’s toy in the hands of an eight or nine-year-old little girl. ”

“Cen Shaoqing immediately walked in front of the little girl. “Little friend, this toy of yours...” ”

“Before he could finish his sentence, the little girl raised her head and looked at Cen Shaoqing. With an old-fashioned manner, she said, “Which family are you from? Is this the attitude you have when talking to your elders?” ”

? ? ?

Cen Shaoqing was stunned.

Why did this little girl sound so angry when she spoke!

“Cen Shaoqing was just about to lecture the little girl and tell her that children should not talk like that when Lin Ze walked over and said, “Great-aunt.” ” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Great-aunt!

Cen Shaoqing was immediately stunned.

Who Was Lin Ze calling great-aunt?

It was simply terrifying!

“The little girl glanced at Lin Ze and nodded. “This is little ze, right? We haven’t seen each other for many years. We almost don’t know each other anymore!” ”

“Lin ze nodded and continued, “Great-aunt, this is searing’s boyfriend.” ”

“After saying that, Lin Ze looked at CEN Shaoqing and introduced, “This is great-aunt.” ”

Cen Shaoqing did not say a word for a long time.

Was this the legendary seniority of the younger generation?

The little girl saw that Cen Shaoqing did not say a word and placed her hands behind her back. She shook her head helplessly. “The younger generation nowadays is really getting more and more insensible!”

“At the end of her sentence, she even let out a meaningful sigh. ”

She looked very much like an elder in the family.

Cen Shaoqing:”...”

“Lin Ze continued, “Great-aunt, there’s self-service ice cream over there.” ”

“Really?”The little girl’s expression immediately changed. “Where is it?”

Lin Ze pointed in a direction and the little girl immediately ran over.

“Lin Ze explained to CEN shaoqing, “Great-aunt is a relative of Grandma’s side. Grandma has to call her mom ‘Little Aunt’. Anyway, it’s quite complicated. Our great-aunt only got this daughter when she was almost fifty years old. She dotes on her like nothing else.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing had always known that ye Zao’s seniority was very low, but he did not expect that ye Zao’s seniority was even lower than that of a seven or eight-year-old child. ”

He had miscalculated!

“Lin Ze seemed to have read CEN Shaoqing’s mind. He patted him on the shoulder and said, “You’ll get used to it in the future.” ”

“”Brother, what are you guys talking about?”At this moment, ye Zao walked over to the two of them. ”

“Lin Ze smiled and said, “I just introduced our great-aunt to fifth brother.” ”

Ye Zhuo couldn’t stop smiling.

“Actually, when she first met her great-aunt, she was also very shocked. ”

“At that time, she even called her great-aunt a little sister. ”

“In the end, she was severely taught by her great-aunt. ”

“Even now, Ye Zhuo still remembered the scene at that time. ”

“Looking at Cen Shaoqing’s appearance, she knew that he must have been taught by his great-aunt. ”

Zhao Pingting was a little puzzled. “What about great-aunt?”

“This great-aunt has a great background!”Ye Zao said mysteriously.

“Zhao pingting asked curiously, “Is she a very powerful big shot?” ”

Ye Zao and Cen Shaoqing were already very powerful big shots.

Zhao Pingting was very curious. What kind of big shot could make CEN Shaoqing show such an expression.

“”It’s really quite impressive.”Ye Zhuo turned his head and pointed in a direction. “Here, that’s the one.” ”

“Hearing this, Zhao Pingting tiptoed and looked over. “Is it the old man wearing the Purple Cape?” ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “It’s the one eating ice cream next to the old man.” ”

“Hearing this, Zhao Pingting widened her eyes and looked at ye Zhuo in disbelief. “Is it the little kid who is eating ice cream?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

Zhao Pingting was in disbelief. “Are you sure that that little friend is your great-aunt?”

“”Yes, definitely,”ye Zao said. ”

Zhao Pingting swallowed her throat.

This big shot was really big. No wonder Cen Shaoqing had such an expression on his face.

“Very soon, the luncheon began. ”

The Lin Family Manor had a special banquet hall.

“After the luncheon, Lin Jincheng, Ye Shu, Ye Langhua, Old Mrs. Cen, Zhou Xiang, and the other four brothers of the Lin family sat together and discussed the wedding day. ”

Old Mrs. Cen took out the three dates that she had chosen.

“After Lin Jincheng saw them, he showed them to the other four brothers as well. ”

“The few of them discussed for a while, and Lin Jincheng continued, “Old Mrs. Cen, why don’t we set it for the sixth day of February next year?” ”

“Old Lady Cen smiled and said, “As long as you don’t have any objections, we won’t have any objections.” ”
