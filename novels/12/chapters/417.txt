“Ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing arrived, inside has been full, waiting for about ten minutes, just waiting for an empty seat. ”

Cen Shaoqing handed the sugar water sheet to Ye Zhuo.

“Ye Jiao ordered three bowls of sugar water in one breath, and then handed the sugar water sheet to Cen Shaoqing. ”

“Cen Shaoqing see sugar water list popularity recommendation, “I see the main recommendation is milk sweet potato sago, or you have a milk sweet potato sago?” ”

Ye Zhuo shook his head and refused. “Forget it. I don’t like sweet potatoes.”

“At this moment, Cen Shaoqing thought of he ziteng’s words and said to the shop assistant, “I’ll have two servings of milk and sweet potato sago.” ”

Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly. “You want two servings of this?”

“CEN Shaoqing said, “The other one is for you.” ”

“I really don’t like sweet potatoes. One serving will do.”

Cen Shaoqing closed the sugar menu. “I know you like it. Don’t be shy in front of me.”

Ye Zhuo:”...”where did this person get his confidence from?

The ordered sugar water was quickly served.

Two servings of milk sweet potato sago were included.

“After eating the sugar water he had ordered, in order to avoid wasting it, Ye Zhuo still picked up the bowl of milk sweet potato sago. ”

He thought he would get a very strange taste.

“However, the sweet potatoes here did not have that disgusting taste. ”

“In her world, sweet potatoes were simply the worst food in the world. ”

He did not expect the sweet potatoes here to be so delicious!

“After eating one bowl, ye Zao ordered another. ”

“Seeing that ye Zao was eating so well, Cen Shaoqing curled her lips slightly. ”

What he ziteng said was indeed true.

Girls liked to say the opposite of the truth.

“After eating, the two went shopping to digest their food. ”

“When they passed by a high-end women’s clothing store, Cen Shaoqing saw a pink dress. ”

It was very nice.

The hem of the dress was also inlaid with diamonds.

“Thinking of his phone case, Cen Shaoqing felt that ye Zao must like pink very much, so he raised his head to look at Ye Zao. “What do you think of that dress? Is It Nice?” ”

“”It’s not very nice. It’s a little childish,”ye Zao gave a pertinent comment. ”

Cen Shaoqing’s lips curled up slightly.

Not Nice?

Then it’s very nice. I like it very much!

“Thinking of this, Cen Shaoqing lifted his feet and walked into the shop. ”

Ye Zao hurriedly followed his footsteps. “What are you going in for?”

Cen Shaoqing looked back slightly. “I’ll give you a surprise.”

Ye Zao:”? ? ?”Why did she feel that Cen Shaoqing was acting strangely today?

An illusion?

“The moment the two of them entered the shop, they were warmly welcomed by the shop staff. Cen Shaoqing pointed at some other pink clothes. “Do you think these look good?” ”

“They don’t look too good.”

“Hearing that, the smiles on the shop staff members’faces were a little awkward. ”

“At first, they thought that they had met a big client. ”

They did not expect that the other party would not like them at all.

Cen Shaoqing raised his head and looked at the shop assistant. “Wrap up all the clothes from earlier.”

“The shop assistants were all stunned! They even suspected that they had heard wrongly and asked with uncertainty, “Sir, do you want to wrap up all the clothes?” ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

The shop assistants immediately went to wrap up the clothes.

Ye Zhuo was also stunned by Cen Shaoqing’s confusing behavior.

What on Earth was this person doing?

“Soon, the clothes were wrapped up. The shop assistant looked up at Cen Shaoqing. “It’s a total of 76,000 yuan. Are You Alipay or wechat?” ”

“Why is it so cheap?”Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly.

“In Cen Shaoqing’s heart, he felt that it was best to give ye Zhuo the best! ”

“After all, he usually spent six figures on a long gown. ”

“He only spent 76,000 yuan on a dozen of them. ”

Cheap?

“How could 76,000 yuan be cheap? ”

“The shop assistants, including the other customers of the clothing store, were stunned. They all looked at Cen Shaoqing. ”

“He was originally cold and extraordinary. At this moment, under the contrast of the money, everyone felt that his entire body was glowing! ”

“If it weren’t for ye Zhuo standing beside him, they would have made their move! ”

“Although they felt that the price was too low, the shop assistants had already wrapped up the clothes, so Cen Shaoqing still paid the bill. ”

“After leaving the clothing store, the two of them went for a stroll elsewhere. ” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“In the evening, Cen Shaoqing sent ye Zao back. He took out the clothes from the trunk and said, “Ye Zao, you forgot to take the clothes.” ”

“Clothes?”Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly.

“Cen Shaoqing nodded. “Yes, don’t you like these clothes very much? I bought them specially for you.” ”

“”No, I don’t need them, and I don’t like them either.”Ye Zhuo quickly waved his hand to reject him. ”

“With Cen Shaoqing’s straight taste in choosing clothes, she did not have any objections. ”

“Cen Shaoqing carried the clothes and walked in front. “I’ve said it before. You Don’t have to be polite with me. If you like them, then you like them. There’s no need to be reserved.” ”

Ye Zhuo was stunned on the spot.”? ? ?”

What kind of confusion was this?

Cen Shaoqing looked back at her. “You’re not going home?”

Only then did ye Zhuo react and follow Cen Shaoqing’s footsteps.

Little White opened the door for the two of them.

Cen Shaoqing placed the clothes on the sofa in the living room and then said goodbye to Ye Zhuo.

Ye Zhuo felt a headache coming on. “I really don’t like those clothes. You can take them back.”

“Cen Shaoqing pretended not to hear this. After all, it was a common ailment of girls. “I’ll go back first. I’ll send you a wechat message when I get home.” ”

Ye Zhuo:”...”was there a problem with her ability to express herself?

“Knowing that Cen Shaoqing had a date with ye Zhuo today, he ziteng waited at the Cen House early. ”

“Seeing that Cen Shaoqing had returned, he ziteng followed Cen Shaoqing upstairs and asked impatiently, “How’s fifth brother? How’s the progress today?” ”

“Cen Shaoqing sent a wechat message to tell ye Zhuo that he had already arrived home and said, “I think it’s very good.” ”

“Looking at Ye Zao’s appearance, she should be very happy and touched today! ”

“He ziteng said again, “Then have you confessed to my idol?” ”

“”Do I still have to confess?”He thought that as long as he treated ye Zao Well, ye Zao would be able to understand his feelings. ”

“He ziteng said speechlessly, “Of course I have to confess! If you don’t confess, how will my idol know that you like her!” ”
