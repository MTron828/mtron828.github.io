“After what Lin Qingxuan said, Lin Jincheng finally understood why he wanted to drink. ”

So it was because of the matter between him and Xia Xiaoman.

“Lin Jincheng continued, “What did mom say?” ”

“Lin Qingxuan said, “She said that I want to marry Xiaoman unless she dies. Jincheng, what do you think I should do? What should I do?”The word ‘die’pressed down on Lin Qingxuan until she could hardly breathe. ”

“Hearing this, Lin Jin Cheng furrowed his brows tightly. ”

“He thought that after experiencing so many things, Old Lady Lin would wake up. ”

He didn’t expect that Old Lady Lin would still be the same.

“In the past, Old Lady Lin had interfered in Lin Qingxuan’s life affairs, causing Lin Qingxuan to give up his first love and get together with Zhao shuning. ”

“Now that Lin Qingxuan had finally gotten rid of Zhao shuning and found his true love, Old Lady Lin still tried to stop her. ”

“At this moment, ye Shu came over with a basin of water. ”

“Lin Jincheng took the basin and said, “Fourth brother, let me wipe your face first.” ”

Lin Qingxuan lay on the sofa while Lin Jincheng took a towel to wipe Lin Qingxuan’s face.

“”Dad, feed this to fourth uncle.”Ye Zhuo came down from upstairs and handed Lin Jincheng a black pill. ”

“What’s This?”Lin Jincheng asked.

“Ye Zhuo explained, “It’s a hangover pill. It melts in the mouth.” ”

“”Okay.”Lin Jincheng put the towel back into the basin, took the hangover pill from ye Zhuo, and fed it to Lin Qingxuan. ”

“Five minutes later, Lin Qingxuan woke up quite a bit, but she was still very distressed. She sighed at Lin Jincheng, not knowing what to do. ”

“Seeing Lin Qingxuan like this, ye Zao could not help but say, “Fourth uncle, this matter is actually very easy to solve. You Don’t have to be so distressed.” ”

“Hearing this, Lin Qingxuan immediately looked up at Ye Zao. “Zao Zao, do you have a solution?” ”

“Although ye Zao was only twenty years old and had not graduated from university yet,. ”

Lin Qingxuan had never treated ye Zao as an insensible child.

“Instead of answering, ye Zao asked, “Fourth uncle, do you want to be together with Aunt Xia?” ”

“Yes.”Lin Qingxuan nodded firmly.

“He wanted to be together with Xia Xiaoman, even in his dreams. ”

“Ye Zao said, “Since you want to be together, then be together! Don’t hesitate anymore. You and aunt Xia have been together for half of your lives. There isn’t much time left for you to waste in the rest of your life.” ”

“Lin Qingxuan said with great difficulty, “But on your grandmother’s side...” ”

“He understood the logic, but Old Lady Lin had never relented, so there was nothing he could do. ”

“Ye Zao continued, “Fourth uncle, to put it bluntly, your life was almost ruined in grandmother’s hands. Could it be that this time, if grandmother doesn’t agree with you and aunt Xia being together, you will give up on Aunt Xia? Your behavior isn’t filial piety, but stupidity. Not only did you hurt yourself, but you also hurt Aunt Xia.” ”

“If it weren’t for Old Lady Lin forcing Lin Qingxuan and Zhao shuning to be together, Lin Qingxuan would have ended up like this? ”

“Lin Qingxuan was good in other aspects, but he was too stupid and filial. ”

“Old Lady Lin had caused him to end up like this, yet he was still controlled by Old Lady Lin. ”

“Lin Qingxuan opened his mouth and said, “Zha Zha, what do you think I should do?” ”

“Ye Zha continued, “Follow your heart. Since you want to be with Aunt Xia, you should give her an explanation as soon as possible. As for Grandma, if she wants to cause trouble, you should let her do it. You must let Grandma see your determination! “You are already forty years old, you should have your own opinions. If you don’t even have the right to choose, then what’s the difference between you and a crying baby waiting to be fed?” ”

“Ye Zhuo’s words woke him up from his dream. He was already in his forties. A man in his forties could not even make decisions for his own life. If this were to spread, wouldn’t he be a joke? ”

“Lin Qingxuan immediately sat up from the sofa. “Zao, you’re right! I was too stupid before! I shouldn’t have thought so much!” ”

“After saying that, Lin Qingxuan said worriedly, “But your grandmother said that if I were to be with your aunt Xia, then she would die. I can only choose between her and your aunt Xia...” ”

This was what Lin Qingxuan was most worried about. He was afraid that he would really force his own mother to death. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Ye Zhuo smiled slightly. “Don’t worry, she won’t bear to die.” ”

Old Madam Lin was living a life of superiority now. Would she despise her long life?

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Grandma has many children and grandchildren now. It’s time for her to enjoy her life. How could she be so reckless as to commit suicide? Moreover, grandma is a person who cares about her reputation. Do you think the reputation of suicide is good?” ”
