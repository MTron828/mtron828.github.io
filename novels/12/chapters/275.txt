The moment he said that.

The room instantly fell silent.

Lung Cancer?

Advanced Stage?

Impossible!

How did Zhao Pingting suddenly get lung cancer?

Everyone thought they were hearing things.

“Father Zhao pressed the cigarette butt in his hand into the ashtray and said with a smile, “Tang Jia, stop joking! This joke isn’t funny at all.” ”

“That’s right!”Zhao Yingjun also said.

“”No! I’m not joking,”Tang Jia choked and her eyes instantly turned red. “Little sister really has lung cancer...” ”

Zhao Pingting couldn’t help but turn red.

Clang —

Mother Zhao was pouring water when she heard this and the cup in her hand fell to the ground.

It shattered.

“”Tang, Tang Jia, what are you saying?” ”

Tang Jia covered her mouth and burst into tears.

“Pingting? Really?”Mother Zhao ran to Zhao Pingting’s side.

Zhao Pingting held back her tears and nodded.

“”Child! Child, tell me, this isn’t real!”Mother Zhao hugged Zhao Pingting and burst into tears. “It’s not real! My Son is so young, how could he get this illness? The person who should get this illness should be mother...” ”

She was already in her fifties.

It didn’t matter if she died.

But Zhao Pingting was only nineteen.

She had just entered university.

Her life had just begun.

How could she get this illness? nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“At this moment, mother Zhao wished she could trade her life for Zhao Pingting’s health. ”

“Thinking of what she had done to Zhao Pingting these past few days, mother Zhao was filled with regret. She wished she could slap herself to death. ”

It was all her fault.

It was her fault

“As a mother, she did not care enough about Zhao Pingting. ”

No Wonder Zhao Pingting would suddenly use all her savings to buy gifts for her family.

No wonder...

“It was fine that she did not care about Zhao Pingting, but she actually asked her to work. ”

Father Zhao seemed to have aged ten years in an instant. His legs trembled as he walked in front of Zhao Pingting. He tried his best to hold back his sobs. “Pingting! Child! Didn’t you kill your parents?”

“After saying this, Father Zhao was unable to control his emotions. ”

He covered his face and cried.

This was the first time a fifty-something-year-old man had bent over. He felt as uncomfortable as a child.

The atmosphere in the living room was oppressive and stifling.

It was extremely uncomfortable.

“Zhao Yingjun pinched the bridge of his nose and tried his best to control his emotions. His parents and wife were already on the verge of collapse. At this moment, he had to stand up. Otherwise, this family would be finished! ”

“”Dad, Mom, Tang Jia, Don’t cry. Crying won’t solve the problem.”. “The most important thing now is to go to the hospital immediately. You Don’t have to worry about the money. Tang Jia and I still have more than a million yuan in savings. Now that medicine is so advanced, Pingting will definitely recover!” ”

“Yes! Yes!”Mother Zhao seemed to have grabbed onto a life-saving straw. “Go to the hospital! Quickly go to the hospital. Your Dad and I still have more than six hundred thousand yuan in savings. We will definitely be able to cure Pingting!”

“Zhao Pingting shook her head, “It can’t be cured. Father, mother, brother, and sister-in-law, don’t waste your money. Instead of making me suffer in the hospital, why don’t you let me spend the last part of my life with you guys?” ”

“”It can be cured! It can definitely be cured!”Tang Jia said, “Little Sister, I had a colleague before. She has breast cancer. It’s been five years now. Isn’t she still alive and well? “As long as you maintain a happy mood and cooperate with the treatment, there’s definitely hope for a cure for this disease! “Money is a worldly possession. People are truly priceless treasures! “Little sister, don’t give up on yourself like this!” ”

Zhao Pingting’s parents looked at Tang Jia.

It would be a lie to say that they were not moved.

“They did not expect Tang Jia, who usually seemed to be a person who liked to fuss over things, to be so sensible at critical moments. ”

“”It’s useless! It’s really useless!”Zhao Pingting’s eyes were red as she said, “Lung cancer has the highest mortality rate. There’s no cure at all! Dad, Mom, brother, Sister-in-law! I beg you! Please don’t waste your money on a dying person like me, okay? People have to die anyway. I just took a few steps ahead of time. Don’t be sad. Just treat it as me going on a trip.” ”

“”No Way! Pingting, don’t talk nonsense! You Won’t Die! Mom Won’t Let You Die! Go to the hospital! Let’s go to the hospital now!” ”

“I’m not going!”Zhao Pingting was determined.

She couldn’t go.

“With her illness, going to the hospital was like burning money. ”

“”Pingting, stop fooling around! Come with us to the hospital!”Zhao Yingjun picked up the car keys and dragged Zhao Pingting out. ”

“Zhao pingting cried, “Big Brother, I’m not going! This illness can not be cured. You and sister-in-law have saved for so many years to save enough for the down payment on the house! I can’t be so selfish!” ”
