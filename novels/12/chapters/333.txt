Chapter 334: 108: go to Yunjing and meet Bai Wei! 1

Translator: 549690339

Bai Wei really hoped to see ye Shu soon.

Please Ye Shu.

Make Ye Shu acknowledge her.

“Ye Sen’s conditions were too superior. God knows how many little girls were thinking of pouncing on him. If she didn’t hurry up, what would happen if ye Sen was snatched away by other vixens? ”

“Although she was beautiful and had a good temperament, in terms of age, she was still inferior to young girls. ”

“Just last night, she realized that she was actually starting to have crow’s feet. ”

“Ye Sen continued, “My sister is really a very easy person to get along with. Don’t worry, I will bring you back to see my sister as soon as possible.” ”

“Not only was Bai Wei beautiful, but she also had a good personality. Ye Sen believed that ye Shu would definitely like Bai Wei very much. ”

“Okay.”Bai Wei nodded. “Then I’ll wait for you.”

“”Oh right, this is also for you.”Ye Sen then took out a jewelry box. ”

“Bai Wei asked curiously, “What’s This?” ”

Ye Sen opened the lid. “This is a necklace that I specially went to the mall to choose. Do You Like It?”

“This was a silver platinum necklace, an internationally famous brand. ”

It could not be bought without ten thousand yuan.

“Bai Wei was someone who had worked in the underworld. She recognized the brand at a glance and quickly rejected it. “Ye Sen, we just got together. I can’t accept such an expensive item!” ”

To accept such an expensive item on the first day would inevitably make people suspicious of money.

Only if she didn’t accept it could she win ye Sen’s favor.

“Ye Sen looked at Bai Wei and said seriously, “This is the first time I’m giving you something. Whether it’s valuable or not, it’s a token of my appreciation. I hope you can accept it.” ”

“Bai Wei thought for a moment and said, “If you really want to give me a gift, I want to choose it myself.” ”

“Ye Sen nodded. “Okay, where do you want to go?” ”

“Just follow me.”Bai Wei stood up.

Ye Sen followed her footsteps.

The two of them sat in the car while Bai Wei guided ye Sen.

“Soon, the car arrived at a very lively night market. ”

“”Ye Sen, park the car over there. I’ll wait for you here.”Bai Wei pushed the door open and got out. ” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Okay.”Ye Sen nodded.

Bai Wei stood where she was and waited for Ye Sen.

“Soon, Ye Sen came back. ”

The two walked to the night market together.

It was obviously not Bai Wei’s first time going to a night market. She was very familiar with the environment here.

“Ye Sen was a little surprised and said, “I didn’t expect you to like going to night markets too.” ”

He had thought that a petty female like Bai Wei would definitely not come to a place like the night market.

It seemed that he was wrong.

Bai Wei was far more outstanding than he had imagined.

“Bai Wei smiled and said, “Actually, I prefer this kind of night market to shopping in high-end malls.” ”

Who Didn’t like shopping in high-end malls?

Bai Wei had saved some money during her years as a princess in the KTV.

Her favorite thing was to go to the mall and live the life of a rich person.

She liked the feeling of being flattered by the shopping mall assistants.

“If it weren’t for her acting for ye Sen, she wouldn’t have come to a place like the night market. ”

“Bai Wei walked to a small stall and picked up a necklace. “Ye Sen, do you think this looks good?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Sen nodded.

“Bai Wei smiled and said, “Okay, then I’ll take this one.” ”

“Hearing that, the stall owner immediately introduced enthusiastically, “This beauty has good taste. This is our most popular item this year. The style is novel, and it’s sold out online!” ”

“How much is this?”Bai Wei asked.

“The stall owner said, “98 yuan. This model is pure silver.” ”

Bai Wei looked at ye Sen. “What Are You Waiting For? Pay Up.”

Pay Up?

Ye Sen was stunned.

He had thought that Bai Wei would bring him to the mall to personally pick it out.

He had not expected that Bai Wei would only pick a stall that was worth a few tens of yuan.

“For a moment, Ye Sen’s favorable impression of Bai Wei increased exponentially. ”

It was really rare to see a girl like Bai Wei who was not material.

Ye Sen paid.

Bai Wei handed the necklace to Bai Wei. “Help me put it on.”

“Okay.”Ye Sen nodded and took the necklace to help Bai Wei put it on.

“It was a very low-quality necklace. Bai Wei felt very uncomfortable around her neck the moment she put it on, but she had no choice but to pretend that she liked it very much. She smiled at ye Sen. “Ye Sen, do you think this necklace looks good on me?” ”

Bai Wei looked very pretty when she smiled. Ye Sen was stunned for a moment. “Yes!”

“Then let’s go over there and have a look.”

Bai Wei dragged Ye Sen to the other side.

“At about ten o’clock in the evening, Bai Wei looked at her watch. “Ye Sen, it’s getting late. I should go back. My mom will send a video to check on me later.” ”
