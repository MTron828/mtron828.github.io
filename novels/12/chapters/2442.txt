Chapter 2443: 512: Ye Zao is Miss Ye! 4

Translator: 549690339

Yi Mei’er had wanted to follow Yu senility’s plan and set up a trap for ye Zao by playing golf. Who knew that ye Zao’s skills were so good! He did not give her any chance at all!

“Paula, who was beside him, was also stunned. ”

It was obvious that they were not on the same level as ye Zao.

“Fuduo was standing beside Yu senility. Seeing this scene, she continued, “I told you, Miss Ye is very good!” ”

“”It’s just playing golf. It doesn’t mean anything,”Yu Mumu said. ”

“After all, there were many people who knew how to play golf in this world. ”

Ye Zao was just one of thousands of people.

“FUDUO continued, “You have to believe fifth master’s choice of spouse. He’s not a three-year-old child.” ”

Who Was Fifth Master Cen?

How could he be deceived by a woman?

“Moreover, this woman was ye Zhuo. ”

Ye Zhuo needed to be deceived?

“Yu Nian continued, “IQ has nothing to do with Eq.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing’s IQ did not have any problems, but it did not mean that his EQ was also fine. ”

He did not believe that ye Zhuo did not use any means to get close to Cen Shaoqing.

Because there was no true love in this world.

It was just a game in the human world.

“Having known Cen Shaoqing for many years, he did not want Cen Shaoqing to be deceived so miserably. ”

“As a good friend, he should give Cen Shaoqing the correct guidance. ”

Fuduo sighed. “Why do you have such a deep opinion of Miss Ye?”

“”Because there are no good women in this world,”yu waning said. ”

“Hearing this, Fuduo’s gaze dimmed for a moment. ”

“Did Yu Mumu mean that there were no good women in this world, including her? ”

She really wanted to ask.

What about me?

But she didn’t have the courage.

“At least now she could stay by Yu Mumu’s side. If she asked, she wouldn’t even have the chance to stay by Yu Mumu’s side. ”

Yu Mumu looked at Fu Duo. “What do you want to say?”

“Fu duo shook her head. “No, nothing.” ”

“After the golf, Yu sunset proposed to go camping by the beach for a picnic. ”

The girls were naturally very happy.

“Are we going or not?”Cen Shaoqing turned to look at Ye Zhuo.

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “Yes.”

She knew that Yu sunset was still wary of her.

He was different from Li Qiandong from before.

“Yu Sunset’s wariness did not seem to be directed at her alone, but at the entire group of women. ”

He was filled with distrust towards women.

“Besides, Ye Zhuo was also looking forward to camping and having a picnic. ”

Driving a jeep to the beach was the most suitable.

Ye Zhuo looked at Cen Shaoqing. “Shall I Drive?”

Cen Shaoqing was very happy. “Yes.”

“I heard from Zixu that Miss Ye’s driving skills are not bad.”Yu Luonian’s voice suddenly sounded from the left.

Ye Zhuo tilted his head slightly and saw Yu Luonian’s face.

Ye Zhuo’s tone was indifferent. “Not bad.”

“Yu sunset continued, “That’s really a coincidence. Xian ‘ER’s driving skills are also not bad. Why Don’t you two compete?” ”

“Xian ‘er immediately stuck her head out and said with a smile, “Miss Ye, I wonder if I have the honor to compete with you?” ”

Xian ‘er was the most adorable and sweet-looking of Yu Sunset’s many female companions.

Her voice was also very coquettish.

“”I’d be happy to,”ye Zao said. ”

Yu twilight years had set a location.

“Regardless of time, whoever arrived first would win. ”

Xian ‘er was a professional racing driver.

“When it was time to start, she stepped on the accelerator and directly dashed out. ”

Her speed was so fast that it was like an arrow leaving the bowstring.

Ye Zao was not in a hurry because she realized that the scenery along the way was not bad.

She maintained a speed that was neither fast nor slow.

“Xian ‘er looked at the car that was left far behind. The corners of her mouth curled up into a faint smile. She turned her head to look at Yu Niannian. “Young Master Yu, do you think Miss Ye will cry if she loses later?” ” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

This question was rather clever.

It was a girl.

It was normal for her to cry.

“Ye Zao was younger than Cen Shaoqing by more than ten years. If she lost the race, she would definitely cry. ”

There was a sharp bend ahead. Xian ‘ER’s driving skills were very good. She maintained a speed of 160 km/h as she passed the bend.

“”Not bad!”Yu Mumu looked at Xian ‘er, his eyes filled with admiration. ”

“Xian ‘er smiled and said, “Not bad.” ”

“In front of Yu Mumu, she naturally had to be more modest. ”

“At this moment, the sound of a fierce engine suddenly came from the air. ”

Yu senility looked back and saw a black jeep speeding past. It was so fast that he could only see an afterimage!

“There was another turn ahead, but the Jeep did not seem to slow down at all! ”
