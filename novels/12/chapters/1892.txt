“After Li Sanzhu and Fang Yueyin made their investments and became rich, many poor relatives would come knocking on their doors every year. Not to mention Li Shuyi, even ai Ru was used to it. ”

“After a pause, AI ru continued, “But from the looks of it, they don’t seem to be poor relatives.” ”

Ai Ru only took a glance from afar and did not see the faces of Cen Shaoqing and Ye Zhuo.

“Although she could not see their faces clearly, she could tell from their temperament that they were not the kind of shameless and poor relatives. Ai Ru even felt that they were somewhat familiar. ”

A very familiar feeling.

“Li Shuyi said, “What else can they be if they are not poor relatives? Just my little uncle and aunt’s family, what good relatives can they have?” ”

“The Li family was born as a very ordinary commoner. Looking up, the three generations of their ancestors were all poor people. If it were not for Li Erzhu going to C country and Li Sanzhu getting lucky and becoming rich overnight, the Li family might have been just a poor family now. ”

How could a poor family have rich and noble relatives?

“What about your youngest aunt?”Ai Ru asked.

“Li Shuyi snorted and continued, “Her most powerful relative is a head nurse.” ”

Ai Ru laughed out loud. She finally understood why Li Shuyi looked down on Li Sanzhu and Fang Yueyin’s family.

“Li Shuyi was born rich and noble. Her mother’s relatives were all royalty and aristocrats. She grew up with a silver spoon in her mouth, so it was normal for her to have such thoughts. ”

“As the two of them talked, they walked forward. Ai Ru continued, “By the way, did you tell your uncle and aunt about that?” ”

“”Yes,”Li Shuyi said. ”

“How did they react?”Ai Ru asked.

“Speaking of this, Li Shuyi was a little angry, she snorted coldly and said, “What reaction? How else could they react? They deliberately took advantage of Qiao! It was as if they had wronged Li Yueyue! For someone like Li Yueyue to be able to marry my cousin, who knows how many lifetimes she had cultivated her fortune. But they are so good, so disgusting!” ”

“If it weren’t for the fact that Li Yueyue still had some beauty and the Li family still had some money, how could such a good thing happen to Li Yueyue? ”

It was simply a daydream.

“Ai Ru patted her shoulder and said with a smile, “Why bother with that kind of person! Go back and ask Auntie. She will definitely have a way.” ”

“Okay.”Li Shuyi nodded.

“When the two of them went back, Linda was already waiting on the sofa. ”

“”You’re back?”Hearing the footsteps, Linda asked without raising her head. ”

“Yes.”Li Shuyi nodded.

“Linda continued, “How is it?” ”

“Li Shuyi walked to Linda’s side and sat down, telling Linda what happened. ”

“Unexpectedly, after Linda heard it, she was not angry at all. Instead, there was a smile on her face. ”

“Seeing this, Li Shuyi said, “Mom, aren’t you angry at all?” ”

“”What’s there to be angry about?”Linda put the phone on the table and turned to look at Li Shuyi, then said, “Didn’t your uncle not want Yueyue to get married so early? Then let’s do as he wishes.” ”

“Ah! What about cousin?”Li Shuyi was very anxious.

“Linda curled the corners of her lips. “Don’t worry, your uncle won’t be able to sit still. In less than three days, he will definitely come to look for us.” ”

What kind of place was the Jones Family?

“A lean camel was bigger than a horse. Even if the Jones family was down and out now, it was still more noble than the Li family. ”

What was the Li Family?

“In front of their Jones family, the Li family was not even considered as mud on the ground. ”

Li Yueyue was lucky to be able to marry into the Jones family.

“Are you serious?”Li Shuyi looked at Linda.

Linda nodded. “I’ve been with your father for so many years. I know the nature of Chinese people the best.”

Hypocrisy.

“Li Sanzhu and Fang Yueyin were typical examples. When they learned that Li Yueyue could marry into the Jones family, they were obviously very happy, but they pretended to be unhappy and dissatisfied. ”

The purpose of their actions was to make them beg again so that Li Sanzhu and Fang Yueyin could take the opportunity to extort a sky-high betrothal gift. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Not only were they hypocritical, but they were also disgusting. ”

“Li Shuyi said with some worry, “What if they don’t Come?” ”

“”Don’t worry, they won’t not come,”Linda said. ”

“With Li Sanzhu and Fang Yueyin, who were greedy for money, how could they not come? ”

Could they just miss out on this marriage.

“After all, as long as Li Yueyue married John, she would be a member of the Jones family in the future. No one would be able to stand shoulder to shoulder with her. ”

“Seeing her mother like this, Li Shuyi did not say anything else. ”
