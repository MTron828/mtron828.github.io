Hearing that.

Si lui looked up and was momentarily stunned.

Zhao Xueyin was dressed in a black gown. Her already beautiful figure was now even more graceful.

“With the standard make-up of an older sister, she was a completely different person from her usual self. ”

“She was like a fish in water, like a swan in water. ”

“Zhao xueyin smiled and said, “Big Brother Si, why is this? Don’t you recognize me?” ”

“Si lui finally reacted and his face was slightly red. “I really don’t recognize you anymore. Xueyin, this gown suits you very well.” ”

“”Really?”Zhao Xueyin looked at herself from head to toe. “I was originally worried that it didn’t suit me! When I heard brother Si say this, I was relieved! However, Brother Zhao, are you consoling me?” ”

“”No,”the lawyer immediately explained, “What I said is true. This gown really suits you.” ”

“”Miss Zhao, your bag.”Annie jogged out of the dressing room and handed Zhao Xueyin an exquisite mini handbag. ”

“Zhao Xueyin reached out to take the bag and looked up at the lawyer. “Brother Si, let’s go.” ”

“Okay.”The lawyer nodded.

“At this moment, his phone suddenly rang. ”

“Si lui picked up the phone and answered, “Uncle.” ”

“”Okay, I got it.” ”

“After hanging up the phone, Si lui looked at Zhao Xueyin and said in embarrassment, “Xueyin, uncle is looking for me for something. I might not be able to go with you.” ”

“Zhao Xueyin said understandingly, “It’s okay. I’ll get the driver to send me there. You Do Your Thing.” ”

The lawyer nodded. “I’ll look for you after I’m done.”

“Okay.”

“After saying that, the lawyer jogged away. ”

“After all, Father Zhao was quite anxious on the other end of the phone. He couldn’t let Father Zhao wait any longer. ”

“Looking at the lawyer’s back, Zhao Xueyin’s eyes were filled with ridicule. ”

One should know one’s place.

“Unfortunately, the lawyer didn’t know his place at all. ”

She didn’t know where he got the confidence to think that she liked him. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

He had no family background.

He had no power.

“Once the Zhao family fell, the lawyer would also be finished. ”

It was also because of Father Zhao’s bad judgment that he always used the lawyer as a spare tire.

In her opinion.

The lawyer didn’t even have the right to be her spare tire.

“Even if she couldn’t marry master five, she wouldn’t marry a phoenix like the lawyer. ”

It was Father Zhao’s various actions that made si lui mistakenly think that she liked him too.

“Every time she thought of this, Zhao Xueyin felt extremely uncomfortable. ”

She was extremely repressed.

“However, she couldn’t say such things to anyone else. ”

“After a long while, Zhao Xueyin stopped thinking and handed her bag to Annie. “Let’s go.” ”

Annie nodded and followed Zhao Xueyin’s footsteps.

Not long after.

The car stopped at the entrance of the top hotel in the financial center.

“That night, the entire hotel was contracted by elder Zhang, and everyone who came was attending the banquet. ”

“Zhao Xueyin had deliberately come at the right time. At this moment, rows and rows of luxury cars were already parked outside the hotel. Ye Zhuo was, after all, a descendant of the Ye family, and everyone wanted to see the elegant demeanor of the Ye family’s descendant. ”

“Standing at the entrance of the hotel, Zhao Xueyin straightened her back and maintained a decent smile on her face. ”

“Step by step, she walked into the hotel. ”

The originally noisy banquet hall became quiet as Zhao Xueyin walked in.

“Is that Miss Zhao?”

“”As expected, Miss Zhao is still Miss Zhao! With such grace, temperament, and looks, I’m afraid there’s no other person in the entire financial circle!” ”

“”I wonder who is better, the descendant of the Ye family, compared to Miss Zhao?” ”

“”Miss Zhao is wearing the DL family’s high-end starry sky gown tonight. It’s said that even the princess of country Y can’t wear this gown!”! I didn’t expect Miss Zhao to wear it so well! Putting everything else aside, just this outfit alone, that so-called descendant of the Ye family is going to lose!” ”

“Listening to all the exclamations, Zhao Xueyin mouth arc more intense. ”

“”Dear guests, good evening. Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to attend the welcome banquet organized by Shunxi Financial Group for Miss ye searing, the descendant of the Ye family. Next, I would like to introduce Miss Ye to you... . .” ”

“At this time, the air suddenly appeared in the voice of Zhang Old, was still looking at Zhao Xueyin of the crowd, have turned back to look at the stage. ”

“They didn’t introduce her earlier, and they didn’t introduce her later. They just had to introduce her when she was in the limelight. ”

Zhao Xueyin frowned.

This old fellow!

Did he do it on purpose?

But this was also good.

“This way, everyone could see her and Ye Zhuo more directly. ”

It wouldn’t be awkward if they were wearing the same clothes.

It would be awkward if they were ugly.

“After tonight, ye Zhuo would lose just in terms of imposing manner. ”
