Chi!

“The car suddenly stopped. Because of the sudden force, Lin Jincheng fell forward fiercely. ”

“”Boss, are you okay?” ”

“I’m fine.”Lin Jincheng waved his hand and pushed the door open to get out.

“As soon as he pushed the door open, he saw three motorcycles surrounding his car. ”

“Li Wen hugged his helmet and went forward. “Uncle Lin, Hello! The three of us are brother Ze’s friends. We’re very sorry to suddenly stop you. Please wait for a moment. Brother ZE will be here soon.” ”

Lin Jincheng narrowed his eyes. “Did ah ze send you here?”

“Yes.”Li Wen nodded.

Lin Jincheng looked at his watch. “But uncle still has other things to do right now. It’s almost time. Do you guys think that you can let Uncle Handle Things First?”

“Fat Tiger was straightforward. “You’re in a hurry to marry brother Ze’s stepmother, right?” ”

“Dog two said, “Uncle Lin, ah ze doesn’t like Auntie Feng, and he doesn’t like Feng Xianxian either. We hope that you can reconsider this matter.” ”

“Lin Jincheng’s gaze was a little far-reaching, “There are some things that uncle won’t be able to explain to Ah Ze in a short period of time, but please don’t worry. Ah Ze will understand in the future! “Kids, let me go first!”! “I’ll tell ze about his problems when we get home!” ”

“”No!”The three of them were very firm. “Before brother Ze comes, we can’t Let You Go!” ”

“Seeing that the auspicious time was getting closer and closer, Lin Jincheng became more and more anxious, but Li Wen, fat tiger, and Buttface didn’t let him go at all. ”

“At this moment, a small car stopped. ”

The car door opened and Lin Ze walked out.

“”Brother Ze!”When the three of them saw Lin ze, their eyes lit up. ”

“Lin Ze looked at the three of them. “Mosquito, fat tiger, and dog two, sorry for troubling you today.” ” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“The three of them waved their hands and said with a smile, “It’s just a small matter! Brother Ze, talk to uncle properly. Don’t quarrel. We’ll go back first.” ”

“Okay.”Lin Ze nodded.

The three of them got on their bikes and left.

“Lin Jincheng walked to Lin Ze’s side. “Ah Ze, what do you want to tell me?” ”

“”Dad, I found my mom.”Lin Ze took out the letter and the photo from his bag. “My mom’s name is Ye Shu! Her name is ye Shu! She’s not Feng Qianhua!” ”

Ye Shu!

“When he heard this name, Lin Jincheng’s eyes instantly turned red. When he saw the photo and the letter again, the memories buried deep in his mind flooded in like a tap that had been turned on! ”

He remembered.

He remembered everything.

Secretary Zhang was stunned. Cold sweat broke out on his forehead. He didn’t expect the matter to be exposed so quickly.

“Lin Jincheng turned to look at Secretary Zhang and said to Lin ze, “AH ZE, let’s go home first!” ”

Lin Ze nodded and followed Lin Jincheng into the car.

“Not long after, the car stopped in front of the Lin family’s manor. By now, almost all the guests had arrived. ”

“Seeing Lin Jincheng walk in, Old Mrs. Lin was overjoyed. She was just a little puzzled as to why Feng Qianhua didn’t come in with him. ”

Could she be in the back?

“Old Mrs. Lin thought to herself, this child really doesn’t know how to do things. ”

How could he leave Feng Qianhua alone to come in!

“Fortunately, this wasn’t a wedding ceremony, it was just an engagement ceremony. ”

“Lin Jincheng walked straight to the stage and dialed the microphone, “Thank you all for taking the time out of your busy schedules to attend our Lin family’s engagement party. However, I regret to inform everyone that the engagement party is going to be canceled! In my entire life, the only woman that I, Lin Jincheng, deeply love is Ah Ze’s mother, Ye Shu. I will not marry anyone else! And I will not be engaged to anyone!” ”

“As soon as these words were said, the people below the stage began to discuss animatedly. ”

The engagement party was canceled?

Who would cancel their engagement on the day of the engagement party?

“Offstage, Old Lady Lin was so angry that her face had turned pale. Her entire body was trembling. She pointed at Lin Jincheng’s back and said, “Unfilial son! Stop right there!” ”

“Lin Jincheng turned around and looked at Old Lady Lin. He bowed and said, “Mom, I’m Sorry!” ”

Old Lady Lin closed her eyes and fainted just like that.

The entire Lin family was in a mess.

“Lin Ze followed Lin Jincheng to the door. “Dad, are we going to look for my mom?” ”

“Yes.”Lin Jincheng nodded. “Let’s go look for your mom.”

“They had already missed out on so many years. After experiencing this incident, Lin Jincheng didn’t want to miss out anymore. ”

No matter what happened back then.

Whose child was ye Shu’s.

He was willing to accept it!

“His life had only been a few decades, and he had already wasted half of it. He wanted to cherish the rest of his life... ”
