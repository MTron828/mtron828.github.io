“Chapter 816: 179: Face Smacking, 5th Master: This is my girlfriend, Ye Zhuo! 1”

Date?

How could Cen Shaoqing go on a date?

Tang Xue had followed her father into the experimental base when she was 16 and was now an old man in the base.

“From the age of 16 to 28, it had been a total of 12 years.”

Tang Xue watched the base grow from 10 people to thousands of people today. She had personally witnessed how Cen Shaoqing had been crowned king and personally created his own power!

“After twelve years in the experimental base, Tang Xue Knew Cen Shaoqing very well.”

“Cen Shaoqing appeared to be gentle and gentle on the surface. He ate vegetarian and prayed to Buddha. He always held a string of Buddhist beads in his hand. In fact, this person’s personality was perverse. He was good at disguising himself. His methods were cold and harsh, causing even the big shots in the international department to change their expressions.”

“Therefore, when she learned that Cen Shaoqing was an unmarried man, Tang Xue was not surprised at all.”

That was because there was no woman in this world who could conquer Cen Shaoqing.

It was too cold at the top.

The Strong were born lonely!

Cen Jiang scratched his head. “But the person who just received Master Five’s call was clearly a girl! and master five also said that we should think of a way ourselves. Why did he suddenly come to the laboratory again?”

It seemed a little strange.

“Tang Xue lowered her head and tidied her clothes. “Master five has four older sisters. It’s not strange that the person who answered the call was a girl, right?””

Cen Jiang Thought for a moment. “That seems to be the case.”

Cen Hai patted Cen Jiang on the head. “I was so excited for nothing. I thought that our base would really have a female master.”

Cen Jiang looked dejected. “I didn’t expect it to be like this either.”

“”Alright, Alright. Both of you, stop fooling around.”Tang Xue continued, “Follow me to the front to receive master five.””

“”Yes, Sister Xue.””

“Tang Xue had stayed in the base for twelve years. In addition to her good talent, she had made many contributions to the laboratory. Now, she was already a senior laboratory technician and associate professor in the laboratory.”

“At the same time, Tang Xue was also the most capable young woman in the laboratory. Her status in the laboratory was very high. In addition, she was very beautiful and had a good temperament. She was the goddess in the hearts of many people.”

The three of them walked to the reception hall of the laboratory.

“The laboratory was all high-tech. In order to prevent people from sabotaging it, many traps had been set up.”

“At this moment, there was already a person standing in the hall. She was wearing a lab coat and was looking straight ahead. It was obvious that she was waiting for someone.”

“Director Zhao.”Tang Xue walked over.

Director Zhao was also one of the elders of this base.

“Tang Xue’s father, Tang Rushan, retired last year. Otherwise, he would also be one of the elders.”

“After Tang Rushan retired, the position that belonged to him had always been empty. A few elders all wanted to groom Tang Xue to be Tang Rushan’s successor.”

“Little Xue is here.”Director Zhao smiled and turned his head.

“Cen Jiang said, “Is fifth master not here yet?””

“Not yet.”Director Zhao shook his head.

At this moment.

Ding —

The door to the hall slowly opened.

A tall figure walked in from outside. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Tang Xue raised her eyes slightly and looked at the person who came in. “Master Five.”

It was also at this moment that Tang Xue realized that there was actually a young girl standing beside Cen Shaoqing.

Very Young.

She was about eighteen or nineteen years old.

Her facial features were outstanding and she had the appearance of a country-toppling beauty. Her porcelain-white skin was suffused with a cold color under the illumination of the laboratory’s lights.

“She was wearing a white shirt, and the hem of her shirt was casually tied around her slender waist. She looked a little unruly, with a slight hint of lightness and a hint of bandit aura.”

“Her legs were long and straight, and her face was so beautiful that people couldn’t take their eyes off her without putting on makeup. Her standard phoenix-shaped eyes were sparkling.”

Who Was this girl?

A new member of the experimental base?

Then which department would she join?

The quality control department?

The R & D Department?

Or her technical department?

Tang Xue’s expression was the same as usual.

Director Zhao and Cen Jiang and Cen Hai were stunned.

No one had expected that a member of the opposite sex would suddenly appear beside Cen Shaoqing.

Strange.

It was even more strange than the sun rising from the west.

They were thinking the same as Tang Xue.

They all felt that this girl was definitely a new member of the base.

“Director Zhao was the first to react. He smiled and said, “Master Five, is this young lady a new member of our laboratory?””

“Cen Shaoqing looked at director Zhao and opened his thin lips. “Elder Zhao, this is my girlfriend, Ye Zhuo.””

Girlfriend?

When he said that.

Everyone was stunned.

Who would have thought that the decisive person who claimed that he would never get married would suddenly have a girlfriend by his side?

This was too surreal!

Especially Tang Xue.

She felt like she was dreaming.

She had always felt that no one in this world could match up to Cen Shaoqing.

She did not expect that CEN Shaoqing would have a girlfriend.

“Moreover, he had brought her to the laboratory.”

Cen Shaoqing was not the kind of person who did not know his place.
