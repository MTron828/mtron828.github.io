Chapter 2576: 342: just an outsider

Translator: 549690339

This was the Lin family after all.

“The Lin family was surnamed Lin, and an Lizi was a foreigner. What right did she have to criticize her in front of her? ”

It was simply disgusting.

Wang bin had never been treated this way before. He could not take it for a while.

“”Third cousin, What’s wrong with you?”At this moment, Li Hang walked over from the side with a smile on his face. ”

“Of course, Wang Bin would not tell anyone about his scandal. He smiled and said, “It’s nothing.” ”

“Li hang continued, “There are so many beautiful women here today. Do you have anyone you like? If there are, let Lizi introduce you.” ”

“”Forget it!”Wang bin Said self-deprecatingly, “How can I touch her?” ”

A joke from her could make an Lizi give him a bloody lesson. How could he expect an Lizi to hook him up?

This was a dream!

Li hang narrowed his eyes. “What’s going on between the two of you? Is there a misunderstanding?”

“”Nothing.”Wang bin was very stupid, but he was not stupid. He naturally knew that Li hang was not someone who was easy to deal with. ”

“The two of them had their own thoughts. Li hang continued, “I’m serious. If you’re really embarrassed to say anything to Lizi, just tell me. I’ll get wechat for you.” ”

“”No,”Wang bin Said. ”

“Li hang continued, “The relatives of the Lin family are not simple people. Are you sure you want to miss it? The little girl who sat at the Mahjong table with me just now is not bad. I heard that her family is in the clothing business. She alone has bought three villas in the capital!” ”

Buying three villas in the capital was not just a matter of words.

“After all, an ordinary person wouldn’t be able to buy a villa in the capital even if they spent their entire life. ”

“Although Zhao Pingting usually kept a low profile and wore ordinary clothes, she was actually an invisible rich lady. ”

“”Who is it?”Upon hearing this, Li Hang’s interest was piqued. “How does it look?” ”

“”There’s nothing to say about its appearance!”Li hang continued, “It’s on the same level as Lizi. I heard that the two of them were high school classmates.” ”

“Where are they?”Wang bin asked.

“Li hang said, “Come with me.” ”

Wang bin immediately followed Li Hang’s footsteps.

The two of them came to the hall together.

Zhao Pingting was still sitting at the table playing mahjong.

“Li hang pointed at Zhao pingting and said, “She’s the one wearing the grass-green dress and sitting there playing mahjong.” ”

Wang bin immediately followed his line of sight and looked over.

“Immediately after, a disappointed look appeared in his eyes. ”

“If he had not seen ye Zhuo before, he might have been attracted to Zhao Pingting. ”

“But after seeing ye Zhuo and then looking at the others, he did not feel anything. ” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“”You still don’t like her?”Seeing Wang Bin like this, Li Hang asked in disbelief. ”

“As a woman, she already thought that Zhao Pingting was good-looking enough! ”

He did not expect Wang Bin to actually not like her.

How High was his standards?

“Wang bin Said, “That’s it. It’s not as exaggerated as you say.” ”

Li Hang rolled his eyes in his heart.

Big Brother.

Please look at yourself in the mirror.

“Li hang continued, “She’s only 22 years old.” ”

“It was a very short sentence, but it had another meaning. ”

“The meaning was that Zhao Pingting could buy three villas in Beijing at 22 years old. Wang Bin was almost 30 years old this year, and everything depended on his family. ”

What right did he have to look down on Zhao Pingting?

This was simply ridiculous!

“Wang bin glanced at Zhao Pingting. “Since you’ve already said so, then I’ll reluctantly give it a try.” ”

Li Hang was really speechless.

“She could be considered to have met many people, but this was the first time she had met a scum like Wang bin. ”

“If any girl were to meet him, it would really be the misfortune of eight lifetimes! ”

“Li hang smiled and said, “After that, you have to give me, this matchmaker, a big red packet.” ”

“Okay.”Wang bin nodded.

“Wang bin continued, “You’re only talking about me. Why didn’t you ask an Lizi to introduce you to someone? There are so many influential people here!” ”

“”I don’t want to look for a boyfriend for the time being,”Li Hang said. ”

“If she didn’t look for a boyfriend, then she wouldn’t make do. ”

Making do with it wasn’t her style.

“Wang bin nodded. “If you like someone, don’t stand on ceremony with me.”It was easier for a man to strike up a conversation with a man than for a woman to strike up a conversation with a man. ”

“Okay.”Li hang nodded.

“At this moment, Li Hang seemed to have seen something and continued, “I’m going to take a look over there.” ”

It just so happened that Wang Bin and Li Hang didn’t have much to talk about. “You go ahead.”

Li Hang walked to the other side.

This was the garden area of the villa.

“Lin Qingxuan’s villa was built halfway up the mountain. There was only one villa in the surroundings and it was located in an open location. It was currently early autumn and the breeze was blowing gently, bringing with it a faint orange fragrance. ”
