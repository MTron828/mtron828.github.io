“Chapter 1644: 345: Trash, Tang Xue is expelled from the base. 5”

Translator: 549690339

“Cen Shaoqing pulled out a document from the pile of documents and threw it in front of Tang Xue. “Colluding with the C Nation people, betraying the base, and even trying to blow up the aircraft carrier, Tang Xue! You’re really giving Mr. Tang face!” ”

“The last sentence was neither light nor heavy, but it made Tang Xue kneel on the ground in fear, she cried, “Fifth Master, please give me another chance! I swear, I won’t be like this in the future! I grew up in the base. If I leave the base, I won’t be able to live anymore! Fifth Master, Please!” ”

“Tang Xue had been very smart since she was young. She understood many things at a single point and was much smarter than children her age. Furthermore, Old Master Tang did not have any preference for sons over daughters, therefore, when Tang Xue was 12 years old, she followed elder Tang into the CEN base. Elder Tang also had the idea of grooming Tang Xue to become his successor. ”

“Tang Xue did not disappoint elder Tang’s expectations. Along the way, her performance was very outstanding. She completed many scientific research experiments and even received many awards. At one point, she became the youngest female doctor in the CEN base. ”

It was precisely because of her success along the way that Tang Xue became more and more proud. She could not see anyone else in her eyes.

It was not until ye Zao’s appearance that Tang Xue’s understanding was shattered.

“Ye Zao was younger than her, prettier than her, and more capable than her. What Tang Xue could not accept the most was that Cen Shaoqing, who had seen through the mortal world and wanted to become a monk several times, had actually changed his mind because of Ye Zao’s appearance, from a monk who had nothing to ask for, he had become a person with flesh and blood. ”

Tang Xue did not believe it. She did not believe that ye Zao was the real ye Zao.

She suspected that ye Zao’s ability was fake and that ye Zao’s beauty was fake.

“She tried to expose ye Zao several times, but ye Zao used his actions to tell Tang Xue that everything on her body was real. ”

Until ye Zao proposed the aircraft carrier plan.

Tang Xue knew that her chance had come!

“For the current human race, the speed of light was the limit. ”

It was impossible for ye Zao to exceed the limit and create an aircraft carrier at the speed of light.

“She had to seize this opportunity so that ye Zao would never be able to make a comeback. Later, ye Zao signed a contract with C Nation as he wished and gambled on the CEN base. God knows how happy Tang Xue was during that time. ”

“Later, William took the initiative to look for her and wanted to sign a contract with her. As long as she helped William, C Nation would hand over the management of the CEN base to her after the gambling agreement came into effect, she would become the person in charge of the CEN base. ”

It was also at this time that Tang Xue knew that her chance to be proud had come.

Tang Xue signed the agreement without hesitation.

“She had thought that after today, she would be able to turn over a new leaf and become the owner of the CEN Group’s base. ”

Who would have thought...

That ye Zao would actually come back alive from Neptune.

“If it wasn’t for ye Zao, she wouldn’t have ended up like this. ”

It was all because of ye Zao.

It was all because of ye Zao!

The person who should have left was ye Zao.

Ye Zao was a scourge.

“Tang Xue cried like a weeping pear blossom. “Fifth master, I know I was wrong. I really know I was wrong! I didn’t do it for the sake of the monk, but for the sake of the Buddha, please forgive me...” ”

Cen Shaoqing pinched his temples. “Get rid of him.”

“Yes!”The special assistant immediately stood up.

“”Fifth Master!”Tang Xue shouted, “You can’t be so heartless! My grandfather sacrificed himself for the base. You Can’t treat the Tang family like this!” ”

“However, Cen Shaoqing acted as if he didn’t hear Tang Xue’s words and dragged her away with the assistant. ”

“Assistant Li looked at Tang Xue, who had lost control of her emotions, and said, “Miss Tang, have you forgotten that you’re not the only granddaughter of Master Tang?” ”

Tang Xue’s expression froze at that moment. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

That’s right.

How could she have forgotten Tang Mi!

“Tang Mi, this little b * tch, what kind of dumb luck did she have to become a core member of Area C by accident? And now, she had even become the first batch of people to land on Neptune! Most importantly, Tang Mi also participated in the construction of the aircraft carrier. This aircraft carrier was the first aircraft carrier in the world! ”

“To humans, it meant a lot. In the future, Tang Mi’s name would follow the first aircraft carrier of humans and be recorded in history forever. ”

“Thinking of this, Tang Xue felt extremely uncomfortable. ”

Tang Mi was not worthy of all of this.

“When she was young, Tang Mi was not as good as him. She took a total of three examinations before she was admitted into the CEN base. If the chief examiner had not given her face, Tang Mi would not have been admitted into the CEN base. ”

But Now?

“She, a truly talented person, had been chased away by the CEN base, while Tang Mi, this clown, stood at the most dazzling spot. ”
