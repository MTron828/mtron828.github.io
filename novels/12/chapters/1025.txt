“Aunt Lang continued, “Half a month is by my side now! I have eyes. I Can See! “I know that Ye Shu is very outstanding and Zhonghua is even more outstanding. If the mother and daughter join the financial world, they will definitely be able to put Shunxi Financial Group on the right track! “But you can’t deprive me of the right to recognize my biological daughter just because of your own interests!””

Old Mrs. Lin slammed the paternity test on the table. “Look at this for yourself!”

“I don’t want to look at these meaningless things!”

“Elder Zhang narrowed his eyes. “Lang Hua, if you don’t want to look at that, then look at this. These are all the details of how Xi Muwen brought Xiao Banyue to Yun capital back then. After you look at these, you’ll understand everything!””

These were all the information ye Zhuo had found.

Aunt Lang looked up at elder Zhang. “Do you think this is interesting?”

“Elder Zhang was helpless as well, “Lang Hua, we really didn’t lie to you! Look at this information. After you read it, you’ll understand everything! The person who really lied to you is Xi Muwen. He wants to use you to officially let the Xi family enter the financial world!””

“Old Madam Lin continued, “To put it in layman terms, you’re Xi Muwen’s stepping stone!”” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Auntie Lang did not think this topic was interesting. She had lost half a month for thirty-six years. For the rest of the time, she only wanted to spend time with half a month.”

“”I’m sorry, I still have something to do, so I won’t be joining you two for tea.”Auntie Lang stood up.”

Old Lady Lin was about to say something when elder Zhang shook his head at her.

“Ye Langhua was currently in a rage. No matter what she said, she would not listen.”

“Elder Zhang picked up the document bag on the table and caught up with Aunt Lang. “Langhua, take this with you! If you ever want to see it, take it out and have a look! Don’t worry, I Won’t Disturb You Anymore!””

Auntie Lang looked at elder Zhang and hesitated before accepting the folder. “I hope you’re a man of your word.”

Elder Zhang nodded.

“After Auntie Lang left the Teahouse, she went straight back to the XI family home.”

“When she saw Auntie Lang return, Yang Jiao immediately went up to her. “Sister, you’re finally back! After you left, you had a high fever for half a month!””

“When she heard that she had a high fever for half a month, Auntie Lang was anxious. “Why did you suddenly have a fever?””

“I don’t know either. Go and take a look!”

Aunt Lang came to Jiang Yan’s bedroom and saw that Jiang Yan was lying on the bed.

The maid was taking Jiang Yan’s temperature. The thermometer showed that Jiang Yan had a fever of 39 degrees.

Aunt Lang turned to look at Yang Jiao. “Go and fetch some water. I’ll help Little Half Moon dry her body. It’ll help to lower her temperature physically!”

“Okay.”Yang Jiao immediately went to fetch water.

“Soon, Yang Jiao brought the water over. “Sister, why don’t you stop running around in the future! You’ve been running a fever for half a month since you left. This means that Xiao Banyue can’t Leave You!””

“Aunt Lang didn’t say anything and focused on wiping Jiang Yan’s arm. At that moment, the scene from 36 years ago suddenly appeared in front of her eyes.”

“At that time, Xiao Banyue was only three years old. A three-year-old child poured water for her and accidentally burned her left arm.”

“Because the injury was quite serious, the Doctor said that it would definitely leave a scar when she grew up.”

“However, there was no trace on Jiang Yan’s arm. There was no trace of a scar at all.”

Aunt Lang frowned slightly. Could it be that she remembered wrongly?

It was her right arm that was burned?

“Aunt Lang changed her right arm and rolled up her sleeves, but there was still no trace on Jiang Yan’s right arm.”

What was going on?

Could it be...

This was really not half a month?

“Aunt Lang tried hard to calm herself down. She looked up at Yang Jiao and said, “Yang Jiao, help me take care of her for half a month. I have something to do in my room. I’ll come over immediately!””

“”Okay, you go ahead.”Yang Jiao nodded.”

Aunt Lang came to the room and opened the document bag given by elder Zhang.

“Just as she opened the document bag, a seven-inch black-and-white photo fell out. Aunt Lang picked it up and looked at it with tears in her eyes.”

“The child in the photo was about seven or eight years old, but she still looked a little like when she was young.”

Half a month...

That’s right.

This was her half a month!
