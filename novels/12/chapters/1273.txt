“Hearing this, Captain Li’s expression was a little complicated. ”

He originally thought that ye Zhuo was really capable.

He didn’t expect...

“Xu Yao continued, “That surveillance footage was obviously deleted by someone with malicious intent. With my ability, it might be a little difficult for me to recover it as soon as possible. However, I know a senior. Her hacking skills are very good. Perhaps she has a way to recover the surveillance footage.” ”

“Really?”Captain Li’s eyes were full of light.

“Yes.”Xu Yao nodded.

“In a moment, captain Li and Xu Yao walked to the technology department. ”

There were already quite a few people gathered in front of ye Zhuo’s computer.

Because ye Zhuo’s movements were too fast.

“In addition to her good looks and her young age, everyone was very curious. ”

Such a young girl was actually a computer expert sent by the higher-ups.

Could she really restore the surveillance?

“One had to know that there were a total of 56 people in their technical department. After two whole days of research, they were still unable to restore the surveillance. ”

“Could This young lady, who looked like she was not even an adult, do it? ”

The higher-ups were looking down on their technical team too much.

“Miss Ye’s operation seems to be quite different from our usual one.”

“It’s indeed quite different. I feel like I can’t even understand it.”

“I can’t understand it either!”

“Hearing the discussions of the crowd, Xu Yao’s gaze was indifferent, but there was a layer of ridicule hidden within. ”

“Sister Xu Yao.”An intern tugged at Xu Yao’s sleeve.

“What’s Wrong?”Xu Yao turned around.

“The intern continued, “Why do I feel like this miss ye doesn’t understand computers at all?” ”

Anyone with a little computer knowledge wouldn’t be able to do such a thing.

Xu Yao lowered her voice. “Lower Your Voice. She was introduced by Chief Liu.”

The intern’s expression became a little strange.

No wonder he could sit in Xu Yao’s seat the moment he arrived.

It turned out that he had taken a shortcut.

“Even though he had lowered his voice, the others around him could still hear him clearly. ”

The expression in his eyes became very complicated.

Young people nowadays were becoming more and more insecure.

“Captain Li walked to ye Zao’s side and said tactfully, “Miss Ye, if you really can’t repair it, then forget it! I want to rest for a while.” ”

“”Soon.”Ye Zao’s tone was light, and he said without raising his head. ”

Soon?

“Hearing this, Xu Yao’s eyes were full of disdain. ”

Ye Zao was probably dreaming! Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Captain Li continued, “Then how much more time will it take?” ”

“”Wait.”Ye Zao’s words were concise. When she was working, she did not like to talk. ”

Wait?

How Long would it take?

Captain Li was too embarrassed to say anything more.

“After all, this person was introduced by Chief Liu. ”

“No matter what, she could not not give chief Liu Face. ”

“Xu Yao hated people like Ye Zao who pretended to be 13 the most. She continued, “Miss Ye, I have a senior who is quite proficient in this aspect. I have already told her that she will be here in a while.” ”

“What was going on with Ye Zao, who didn’t take a dump in the toilet? ”

Besides.

Was the police station a place to pretend to be 13?

“Do you know how the Daylily is cold?”Ye Zao raised his eyes and looked at Xu Yao.

“His gaze was slightly cold, like the starry sky on a winter night, clear and bright. ”

Xu Yao was furious.

Just wait!

She wanted to see how ye Zao would end up in a moment!

Captain Li gave her a look. “Let’s Wait a little longer.”

Xu Yao nodded.

“Captain Li continued, “You stay here and watch. I’m going out for a smoke.” ”

“Alright.”

Captain Li walked outside and lit up a cigarette.

“After finishing his cigarette, Captain Li walked into the house. ”

“”Old Li!”At this moment, a tall police officer walked over. ”

Captain Li turned around. “Old Jia.”

“As the two of them walked in.., he said, “I heard that the higher-ups have sent a computer expert over. How is it? “Have the surveillance cameras been restored? If you’re done here, can you send an expert to our team to take a look? I have a portrait that needs to be restored.” ”

“”Not yet,”captain Li replied. ”

“Old merchant continued to ask, “Where is she?” ”

“Captain Li signaled with his eyes, “She’s over there!” ”

“Old merchant followed Captain Li’s line of sight and saw ye Zhuo’s figure. As there were many people standing in front and behind him, he could only vaguely see a figure dressed in white. “The little girl in White?” ”

“Yes.”

“His hometown asked in surprise, “Is she an adult?” ”

“Captain Li continued, “She’s twenty.” ”

“Twenty?”

Captain Li nodded.

“Old merchant sighed and said, “There really are talented people in every generation!” ”

How long had it been since he was only twenty before he was called a computer expert.

“If he was older, wouldn’t he be even more amazing? ”
