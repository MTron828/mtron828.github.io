“Zheng Wanyin was feeling very uncomfortable at the moment. She did not understand the hidden meaning behind Xie Wanqiu’s words. She nodded and said, “Grandma, I’ll take good care of myself.” ”

“Xie wanqiu glanced at Zheng wanyin and said, “Have a good sleep after eating. Grandma will go down first.” ”

“Okay.”

“When they reached the door, Xie Wanqiu turned back to look at Zheng Wanyin. Her eyes were full of reluctance. ”

“Downstairs, Wu Youyu had already returned. “WANQIU, did you cook all the good dishes on this table?” ”

“”Yes.”Xie wanqiu nodded. “To celebrate that we can finally be together, quickly wash your hands and eat!” ”

“Yinyin isn’t coming down to eat?”Wu Youyu asked.

“”That child is feeling terrible. I’ve already sent the food over just now,”Xie Wanqiu said. ”

“OH.”Wu Youyu nodded and washed his hands before coming over to eat.

“After watching Wu Youyu drink the soup and eat the dishes, Xie wanqiu began to eat. ”

“Halfway through the meal, Xie Wanqiu put down her chopsticks and handed Wu Youyu a photo. “Who’s This?” ”

Wu Youyu looked down and saw that he was hugging Zhang Qingqing in the photo.

“To Xie Wanqiu’s surprise, Wu Youyu’s reaction was not very intense. “You’ve discovered me.” ”

“Aren’t you going to explain yourself?”

Wu Youyu took another bite of the food. “Isn’t there only so much between a man and a woman? Is there a need to explain?”

Xie wanqiu slammed the table and stood up. “Wu Youyu! You have no conscience!”

“”If you can’t stand it, you can scram!”Wu Youyu seemed to have changed into a different person. His deep feelings were gone, leaving behind only coldness. ” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Xie wanqiu sneered.

“At this moment, Wu Youyu felt a pain in his stomach. Then, something warm surged up from his throat. “Urgh!” ”

Wu Youyu directly spat out a mouthful of blood.

“Retribution! Retribution!”Xie wanqiu laughed.

“Only then did Wu Youyu react. He looked at Xie Wanqiu in disbelief. “You, you tampered with the food?” ”

“Yes.”

“”B * Tch!”Wu Youyu struggled to hit Xie wanqiu, but he spat out a second mouthful of blood and fell to the ground. ”

Xie wanqiu also began to spit out blood at this moment.

Only when she fell to the ground did she regret it.

Retribution.

This was all retribution.

Retribution for retribution!

“The next morning, Zheng Wanyin came down from upstairs and saw this scene. ”

“Xie wanqiu and Wu Youyu were both lying on the floor, their bodies stiff. ”

“Ah! Grandma! Grandpa! What happened to you? ! What happened? !”

Zheng Wanyin screamed and staggered to call 911 and 120.

She never thought that Xie wanqiu and Wu Youyu would leave her in such a way.

The police and 120 arrived soon.

“After Wu Youyu died, because he had no children, anyone who was related to him would come to split the assets. On the other hand, Zheng Wanyin did not have any proof of kinship with Wu Youyu, before Wu Youyu died, he did not leave any suicide note. Not only did he not get a single cent, he was also accused of coveting the old man’s assets. ”

...

“When she saw the news report about Xie wanqiu, old Mrs. Cen thought that she had seen wrongly. She ran over to Zhou Xiang and said, “Xiang Xiang, Xiang Xiang, quick, look. Is this Xie Wanqiu?” ”

“Zhou Xiang took the phone. She was a little surprised, but she was not surprised. “It’s her.” ”

It was not surprising for someone like Xie Wanqiu to end up like this.

“”A wicked person deserves evil!”Old Mrs. Cen continued, “But it’s a pity to let her die just like that. A person like Xie wanqiu should be cut into a thousand pieces and sent to the eighteenth level of hell to taste every kind of torture in the world!” ”

“Zhou Xiang looked at Old Mrs. Cen in shame. “Mom, I’m sorry for what happened in the past.” ”

“”It’s all in the past. You must not be muddle-headed again in the future!”Old Mrs. Cen looked at Zhou Xiang, she said very seriously, “If you do it again in the future, I’ll break off my mother-in-law-daughter relationship with you and let Shaoqing break off his mother-son relationship with you!” ”

“It won’t happen again. It Won’t happen again.”

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “You are also not allowed to care about Zhou Zuolong anymore! That old fellow also brought this upon himself. No one is allowed to sympathize with him.” ”

“Yes.”Zhou Xiang nodded.

“After experiencing so many things, Zhou Xiang had long understood. ”

On the other side.

The Cen family’s base.

“Zhou Dongyang was busy working in the construction warehouse. At this moment, the originally quiet construction warehouse was suddenly filled with alarms. Sharp sounds instantly filled every corner of the base. ”

“What’s Wrong?”

“Cen Jiang, Cen he, Cen Hu, and Cen Hai, the four brothers, came in from outside. ”

“Zhou Dongyang looked at the four brothers, his eyes filled with anxiety. “Quickly inform Miss Ye! The nuclear reactor has malfunctioned!” ”
