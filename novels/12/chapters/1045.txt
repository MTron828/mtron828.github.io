“Zhao Xueyin listened to the conversation in the living room, and her expression was slightly dazed. ” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Even the water in the cup was overflowing, and she was completely unaware of it. ”

Why was she not a boy?

“Miss! The water is full!”The voice of a servant came from the side.

Only then did Zhao Xueyin react. She put the teapot back and used a tissue to wipe the table.

“A few minutes later, Zhao Xueyin came to the living room with the cup in her hand. “Dad, Big Brother Si, have some water.” ”

“Thank you.”Lawyer si took the Teacup with both hands and thanked her.

“You’re welcome.”

“Father Zhao smiled and said, “Ah Lui, you don’t have to be so formal! We’re going to be a family after all!” ”

“When she heard this, Zhao Xueyin’s expression became a little desolate. ”

She only treated the lawyer as her older brother.

But father Zhao wanted to set her up with the lawyer.

“The lawyer’s gaze swept across Zhao Xueyin’s face and said with a smile, “Oh right, uncle, I don’t have anything to do the day after tomorrow. Let’s go fishing in the suburbs and relax at the same time, shall we?” ”

“Sure!”Father Zhao nodded.

“After saying that, father Zhao continued, “Tell me more about ye Langhua’s grandson!” ”

“Si lui said, “Actually, ye Langhua’s grandson is nothing to be afraid of. The truly amazing person is ye Langhua’s granddaughter. She’s only 20 years old and already has a phd in science and Technology.” ”

“”It’s useless, it’s useless.”Father Zhao waved his hands. “She’s just a little girl. So what if she has a phd? With a grandmother like ye Langhua, what kind of granddaughter can she have? In the end, she’ll only be a laughing stock!” ”

Father Zhao did not take ye Zao seriously at all.

So what if she’s a doctor?

Zhao Xueyin was also a professor!

“No matter how powerful ye Zao was, he could not beat Zhao Xueyin. ”

But it was different for Lin Ze.

Lin Ze was a boy.

“Not to mention anything else, just in terms of gender, he had already beaten Zhao Xueyin. ”

It did not matter if a boy was not outstanding. He just needed to marry an excellent wife.

“And no matter how outstanding a girl was, she still had to get married! ”

The water splashed by a married daughter.

Why couldn’t Zhao Xueyin be a boy?

“Thinking of this, Father Zhao’s expression darkened a little. ”

“Seeing Father Zhao like this, Zhao Xueyin’s heart also felt very uncomfortable. ”

She only regretted that she did not have a male body.

“Si lui pondered for a moment and continued, “Uncle, actually, this is already an old concept. The times are different now. Men and women have long been equal...” ”

“”Bullsh * T! This is all bullshit!”Father Zhao continued, “Have you seen Beauvoir’s ‘The Second Sex’?” ”

“”Go Ahead,”Si Lu said. ”

“Father Zhao said, “In ‘the second sex’, there is a sentence that says that women are the second sex, the ‘other’that is excluded from men. “Power belongs to men, and women are merely vassals. “The protection of vassals comes from power, and discrimination also comes from power.” ”

Women had always been the vassals of men.

Women wanted to make a name for themselves?

It was difficult!

“First, the gender was not right. ”

“Then, the ability was not enough! ”

“From ancient times until now, the heroes that had been passed down through the ages were mostly men, and there were only a few women. ”

“The lawyer could not win against Father Zhao, so he could only give up. ”

“Zhao Xueyin brought the medicine over. “Dad, it’s time to take the medicine.” ”

Father Zhao took the medicine.

“After the lawyer left, Father Zhao looked at Zhao Xueyin and said earnestly, “I watched that child, ah Lui, grow up. He’s more than enough for you. Don’t look down on him and look down on everyone else!” ”

“Zhao Xueyin sighed. “Dad, lawyer Si and I are just ordinary siblings. The two of us are not suitable for each other at all...” ”

“Father Zhao continued, “Do you still think about love? Ye Langhua also married into love. What happened in the end? Do you also want to be the second ye Langhua?”Father Zhao was very satisfied with the lawyer, firstly, he knew the lawyer very well. Secondly, the lawyer was willing to marry into the Zhao family. ”

“He did not have a son. If Zhao Xueyin married out, wouldn’t the old Zhao family have no descendants? ”

“In this current society, there were not many boys who were willing to marry into the family! ”

The lawyer was a rare good child.

“Zhao Xueyin frowned slightly. “Even if I can’t marry love, I still want to marry the most outstanding man in the world! Dad, I can’t choose gender, but I can choose who I marry!”She wanted to prove to Father Zhao, girls were not much worse than boys! ”

“Although she could not choose her birth, she could marry the most outstanding man! ”

It would make everyone envious of her!

It would also make father Zhao the object of everyone’s envy.

Boys could not do such things.

Father Zhao glanced at Zhao Xueyin. “Aren’t you overestimating yourself too much! The Most Outstanding Man? Who Do you think you are? Lawyer Si took a fancy to you and agreed to marry into our family. I wonder how many lifetimes you have been blessed!”
