“In less than 10 minutes, they arrived at Grandma Fei’s house. ”

Ye Lan got off the aircraft and pressed the doorbell frantically.

Grandma Fei opened the door.

She was not very surprised to see ye Lan with tears streaming down her face.

Ye Lan had trapped herself in a cocoon and refused to listen to advice. She had long known that she would end up like this.

“”Why are you still kneeling here?”Grandma Fei looked at ye Lan and continued, “Who has the guts to actually make the Manxing kingdom’s princess kneel?” ”

“When she heard the words ‘princess’again, Ye Lan felt that it was very ironic. ”

It was also a little disgusting.

“Ye Lan sniffed and said with red eyes, “Grandma Fei, I’m not the Princess of the Manxing Kingdom, I’m Ye Lan!” ”

“”Let me ask you, where is the management rights of the base?”Grandma Fei continued to ask. ”

Ye Lan did not say anything.

“Grandma Fei frowned and said, “You gave the base to Qiu Di?” ”

“Yes.”

“Hearing this, Grandma Fei was so angry that she almost died from anger. ”

“Just yesterday, she had tried to persuade Ye Lan. She did not expect that ye LAN would still give the management rights of the base to Qiu Di. ”

She was as stupid as a pig!

The Ye family base was ye Zao’s blood and sweat.

Ye Lan did this to kill ye Zao’s heart.

“Grandma Fei covered her heart and said angrily, “You gave the ye family base to someone. Why are you still kneeling here? Are you deliberately disgusting people?” ”

She wondered why ye Lan was kneeling here.

So there was no way out.

“”Grandma Fei! Grandma Fei!”Ye Lan grabbed Grandma Fei’s hand and knelt on the ground. “Grandma Fei, I was wrong. I know I was wrong! Please forgive me, Okay?” ”

“”You weren’t wrong.”Grandma Fei pulled her hand back and said expressionlessly, “I was wrong.” ”

She was wrong to have any expectations for ye Lan.

She was wrong to think that ye Lan still had a shred of conscience.

“”Grandma Fei, please don’t do this.”Ye Lan cried bitterly, “I really know I was wrong. I know that elder sister was doing this for my own good. I was the one who bit Lu Dongbin and didn’t know how to appreciate the kindness of others! “I was wrong. Grandma Fei, please forgive me for once on account of my young age. I swear! “I swear there won’t be a next time!” ”

“As long as she was given another chance, she would never be as ignorant and stupid as before! ”

She wanted revenge!

She wanted to stomp the autumn flute under her feet ruthlessly.

“”Late-comers admit their mistakes more lowly than grass!”Grandma Fei looked at Ye Lan like this. “Ye Lan, there are some mistakes that can not be made up for even if you repent!” ”

“I can make it up! I can make it up!”Ye Lan said. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

A prodigal son can never be changed.

She swore that she would be a good person in the future and would never repeat the same mistake.

“Grandma Fei continued, “Can you let those people who died because of you come back to life?” ”

“Hearing this, Ye Lan was stunned. ”

Her tears dripped onto the floor one drop at a time.

“Grandma Fei Sighed, then she said, “If it weren’t for you, nothing would have happened to Luoluo. If nothing had happened to Luoluo, Ye Han would not have become like this! The Ye family’s base wouldn’t have been easy either! Those innocent people wouldn’t have disappeared either! Ye Lan, do you still think you can make up for it now?” ”

Ye Lan wasn’t regretting her mistakes.

She was desperate. admitting her mistakes was the only way she could choose.

“As long as she had a last way out, she wouldn’t come and admit her mistakes. ”

“After yesterday’s incident, grandmother Fei had completely recognized ye Lan. ”

“Hearing these words.., ”

ye Lan’s hands hung down weakly. All the strength in her body was sucked away in that instant.

It was unbearable.

She seemed to have a ball of pent-up anger in her heart and couldn’t get out no matter how hard she tried.

Why was everyone unwilling to forgive her?

No.

Grandma Fei had to forgive her.

If Grandma Fei didn’t forgive her... She really had no way out!

“”Grandma Fei,”Ye Lan raised her head and looked at Grandma Fei, “You treated me like your own granddaughter since I was young. I have always treated you like my own grandmother. If I were your own granddaughter and had the same blood as you, would you still be so cruel to me today?” ”

“”Your own grandmother?”Grandma Fei found it funny, then she said, “When you thought you were the princess of the Manxing Kingdom, why didn’t you think of me as your own grandmother? “You ran to me because you had nowhere else to go and shed a few crocodile tears! “Ye Lan, do you still have a conscience?” ”

“”Grandma Fei, please forgive me!”Ye LAN continued, “It’s not my fault that I caused the consequences today. Do you think that I alone can kill sister?” ”

“”Sister?”Grandma Fei looked at Ye Lan, her eyes full of sarcasm. “Who are you calling sister? Who is your sister?” ”
