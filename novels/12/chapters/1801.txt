He ziteng nodded with a smile.

“I didn’t expect to meet Miss Xu here again.”

“Xu Xiao smiled. “I didn’t expect to see Mr. he again either.”Xu Xiao was a very gentle girl, and her voice was also gentle and gentle. She was the type that he ziteng liked. Otherwise.., he ziteng wouldn’t have set foot in the rice noodle shop again. ”

“He thought he might not see Xu Xiao anymore, but he didn’t expect that not only did he see Xu Xiao, but he also saw her in her original position. ”

“After he said that, he ziteng continued, “By the way, is there anyone across from Miss Xu?” ”

“”No,”Xu Xiao said. ”

“He ziteng said, “Then Miss Xu won’t mind if I Sit Down, right?” ”

“”I don’t mind. Please take a seat, Mr. He,”Xu Xiao said. ”

He ziteng sat opposite Xu Xiao.

“At this moment, the shop owner came over with steaming hot rice noodles. “Here’s your chicken soup and rice noodles.” ”

“”Thank you,”Xu Xiao thanked him politely. ” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

He ziteng looked up at the shop owner. “Please give me a bowl of spicy rice noodles.”

“Xu Xiao said unhurriedly, “Mr. HE, it’s not good for your stomach to eat too much spicy food on an empty stomach in the morning. I suggest you eat something lighter. This chicken soup and rice noodles is very good.” ”

“After saying that, Xu Xiao smiled and said, “Actually, I also like to eat spicy rice noodles. I also like to put double the Chili, but I’ll try my best to restrain myself in the morning.” ”

“Xu Xiao did not know that he ziteng, who had disappeared for many days, would suddenly appear here this morning. ”

He ziteng liked to eat spicy rice noodles.

And the chicken soup and rice noodles were Lin Ze’s favorite.

“Luckily, she was quick-witted. ”

Xu Xiao smiled.

He ziteng nodded. “Miss Xu is right.”

“Then, he turned to the store owner. “Then, I’ll have a serving of chicken and rice noodles.” ”

“”Okay, please wait a moment,”the store owner said. ”

“Seeing he ziteng like this, Xu Xiao heaved a sigh of relief. ”

“It seemed that he ziteng was not as wise as the rumors said. Compared to Lin Ze, he ziteng was too easy to deal with. ”

“She had been punching in at the rice noodle shop for almost a month, but she had not received a single visit from Lin Ze. It had only been a few days? She was already eating at the same table as he ziteng! ”

“If this continued, she would be able to sleep with he ziteng in no time. ”

“If this continued smoothly, she might even be able to meet Cen Wu Ye! ”

“The more Xu Xiao thought about it, the more excited she became. Her eyes were almost sparkling, but she still pretended as if nothing had happened. She picked up her chopsticks and elegantly ate the rice noodles. ”

“The chicken soup and rice noodles were very delicious. They were smooth and refreshing. With the spicy and sour side dishes, they had a different flavor. ”

“However, Xu Xiao could not swallow it. ”

“After all, she ate top-grade ingredients that were sent over by air every morning. Such rice noodles were eaten by lower-class people. ”

“Usually, she was just here for a show. ”

“But today was different. He Ziteng was sitting opposite her. Even if she didn’t want to eat it, she could only endure it. ”

“Soon, he ziteng’s rice noodles were served. ”

“Xu Xiao smiled and looked up. “Mr. HE, this should be your first time eating chicken rice noodles, right?” ”

He ziteng was stunned. “How do you know?”

“Xu Xiao said, “Because your expression now is the same as when I first ate chicken rice noodles.”When she said this, Xu Xiao paused, then she continued, “Once you get used to eating spicy rice noodles, your taste will become monotonous. It feels like you can only accept the spicy taste. In fact, the taste of the chicken soup is also very good! If you don’t believe me, you can try it.” ”

“Xu Xiao had studied psychology before. Through the subtle changes in he ziteng’s expression, she could see the changes in his heart. ”

“Hearing this, he ziteng tasted the rice noodles in his bowl. ”

“The crisp rice noodles blended well with the freshness of the chicken soup. With one bite, it was full of the richness of the chicken soup, and the taste was superb! ”

“Before this, he ziteng had always thought that the rice noodles were only the most delicious with the spicy taste. ”

He did not expect that the chicken soup-flavored rice noodles were also so delicious and unique.

“How is the taste?”Xu Xiao asked.

He ziteng nodded. “It’s very good!”

“”Not bad, right?”Xu Xiao took a sip of the rice noodles. “I often eat like this.” ”

“He ziteng said, “I also like the rice noodles in this restaurant. I used to clock in almost every day when I was in school. Unfortunately, I don’t have that much time now, so I can only come here occasionally to eat.” ”

“To He ziteng, this restaurant not only ate the taste, but also the feelings. ”

Because it carried a lot of memories from his university days.

“Xu Xiao smiled and said, “Then I have to cherish the time now so that I won’t regret it later.” ”
