“Seeing Feng Qianhua like this, Feng Qianhua sighed. “It’s true. The guests downstairs have all dispersed.” ”

Only then did Feng Qianhua realize that the Feng family villa seemed to have quieted down in an instant.

“Is, is it true? ”

How could this be?

Feng Qianhua sat on the chair in a daze. There was not a single glimmer of light in her eyes.

Feng Xianxian was also dumbfounded.

The few sisters-in-law of the Feng family sneered at the mother and daughter before leaving. They did not dare to go too far.

What if the mother and daughter still had a chance to turn things around?

“After the four of them left, Feng Qianhua turned back to look at Feng Xianxian. “Quick... quick, call your Grandma Zhang.” ”

“”Okay, okay.”Feng Qianxian quickly went to get her phone. ”

“After a long while, the other side picked up the phone. ”

Feng Qianxian cried and asked what was going on.

“Aunt Zhang said, “Qianxian, don’t cry. It’s okay. Don’t worry. Pass the phone to your mother. I have something to tell her.” ”

Feng Qianxian had no choice but to pass the phone to Feng Qianhua.

“Feng Qianhua took the phone and asked in a trembling voice, “Aunt Zhang, what exactly happened?” ”

“Aunt Zhang did not expect such a turn of events. She said in a low voice, “Qianhua, Lin Jincheng seems to have regained his memory.” ”

“What?”Feng Qianhua’s breathing stopped.

Regained his memory?

How did he regain his memory all of a sudden?

“Aunt Zhang comforted Feng Qianhua a few more times, but Feng Qianhua could not hear anything. ”

No!

She could not give up just like that.

She couldn’t just lose to ye Shu like that.

Feng Qianhua tried her best to calm herself down. “How’s Aunt Lin Now?”

“Aunt Zhang said, “Her condition isn’t too good. She fainted on the spot and hasn’t woken up yet.” ”

“Please take good care of Aunt Lin. Don’t worry about me.”

“Very good.”

“After hanging up, Feng Qianhua started to remove her makeup. ”

She couldn’t admit defeat.

“The position of the matriarch of the Lin family was hers, and it had always been hers. No one could take it away from her. ”

So what if Lin Jincheng regained his memory?

Could he find ye Shu?

“With the paternity test, Lin Jincheng would never be able to overcome the hurdle in his heart. ”

He was just trying to escape.

He couldn’t possibly find ye Shu!

“Feng Qianhua turned to look at Feng Qianxian. “Qianxian, change your clothes too. We’ll go see your grandma Lin later.” ”

“”Okay, okay.”Feng Qianxian nodded. ”

...

In the bustling city.

Lin Jincheng told Lin ze everything that had happened back then.

Lin Ze sighed after hearing it.

“He didn’t expect so many things to happen. “Dad, don’t worry. I believe mom will definitely understand you.” ”

“From the perspective of his children, Lin Ze still hoped that his parents could get back together and that the four of them could live happily together in the future. ”

Lin Jincheng sighed. “I hope so.”He wasn’t sure if ye Shu would still be able to forgive him.

“Lin Ze continued, “Dad, I’m going to meet uncle at the Royal Cafe.” ”

“Unable to find Ye Shu’s address, Lin Ze had no choice but to ask Ye Sen out. ”

Lin Jincheng nodded. “Then let’s go now.”

“”Okay.”Lin Ze continued, “But I didn’t tell him about this. When we meet, you have to be mentally prepared.” ”

“I will.”

The Royal Cafe was right below Ye Sen’s company.

“So, when Lin Ze and Lin Jincheng arrived, Ye Sen had already arrived. ”

“Seeing Lin ze come over, ye Sen waved at him excitedly. “Ah Ze.” ”

“”Uncle, Uncle Ye.”Lin Ze also waved. ”

“Ye Sen saw Lin Jincheng beside Lin ze and frowned slightly. He subconsciously felt that Lin Jincheng was a little familiar. “Ah Ze, this is your father?” ”

Lin Ze nodded.

“”Sen,”Lin Jincheng said with red eyes. ”

Sen?

Ye Sen was stunned.

How many years had it been since someone called him that?

“”I’m sorry, who are you?”Ye Sen didn’t recognize Lin Jincheng for a moment and couldn’t remember who he was. ”

1

“After all, he was only thirteen at that time. ”

“Moreover, he hadn’t seen ye Sen many times. ”

“Lin Jincheng looked at ye Sen and said, “I’m Lin Qingcheng.” ”

Lin Qingcheng?

“Hearing these three words, the memories buried deep in Ye Sen’s mind flooded out in an instant. ” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Who Was Lin Qingcheng?

Wasn’t Lin Jincheng the scumbag who had deceived ye Shu?

Nineteen years!

A whole nineteen years!

The Scumbag had finally appeared.

“At this moment, other than anger, Ye Sen’s eyes were still filled with a layer of fire. He raised his hand and directly punched Lin Jincheng. ”

Bang!

“Lin Jincheng tilted his head. If not for the chair behind him, he would have fallen to the ground. ”

“”Bastard! Lin Qingcheng, you F * cking bastard! You made my sister suffer for so many years! I’ll beat you to Death Today!” ”
