Chapter 2206: 463: sit steadily in that position! 2

Translator: 549690339

How could a good-for-nothing like him sit steadily in that position?

So what if he had a backer?

Nothing could compare to his own strength!

And man Xing really had strength.

How could man Wen Compare to man Xing?

“Chairman Zhao is here.”Man Wen raised his eyes slightly.

Chairman Zhao bowed. “Yes.”

“Have you brought the items?”Manwen asked.

“I have.”Chairman Zhao took out a document and handed it over to Manwen. “Please have a look.”

Chairman Zhao was in charge of the national treasury.

“Ever since Manjiangshan was in charge of the national treasury, there had been continuous problems with it. Manjiangshan had said several times that they wanted to check the accounts, but Manxing had quietly suppressed them. However, that was already in the past. ”

“Now, as long as the accounts were refreshed and checked from top to bottom, no loopholes could be found. ”

“As for man Wen, he could tell that there was something wrong with this account with trash like man Wen? ”

It was simply ridiculous!

“Therefore, director Zhao did not take this matter to heart at all. ”

“Man Wen took the document, but there was no special expression on his face. ”

“After a long while, he put down the document and looked up at director Zhao. His tone was a little low. “Director Zhao, do you think there’s a problem with this bill?” ”

“”Of course there’s no problem,”director Zhao continued, “Mr. President, don’t worry. In recent years, our Manxing country has been in good weather and the country has been peaceful. The National Treasury has always been very full.” ”

“Is there really no problem?”Man Wen raised his head to look at director Zhao.

“For some reason, when he heard this, director Zhao actually felt a little guilty. ”

What did man Wen Mean?

Could it be that man Wen had discovered something?

No. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

It wouldn’t be.

What could a good-for-nothing like man Wen understand?

He was probably trying to scare him.

“Although Man Wen didn’t have a brain, his brother who stood behind man Wen was a big shot. These words were definitely taught to man Wen by those people. ”

Trying to get information out of him?

How was that possible!

“Director Zhao looked at man Wen and said without feeling guilty, “If there was really a problem, wouldn’t you be able to tell?” ”

Man Wen nodded.

“Seeing Man Wen like this, the corners of director Zhao’s mouth curled up into a mocking smile. He knew that this trash man Wen was lying to him. ”

“Director Zhao continued, “Do you have any other orders?” ”

Man Wen didn’t say anything.

“Man Wen couldn’t even understand the bill, so director Zhao naturally didn’t have to put him in his eyes. He continued, “Mr. President, if there’s nothing else, I’ll take my leave first.” ”

PA!

“At this moment, the document that was originally in man Wen’s hand was smashed to the ground. ”

“”Zhao Shan Dong, do you really think I’m Dead?” ”

Director Zhao’s face broke out in cold sweat.

What was going on with Man Wen?

Could it be that he had really seen through something?

No.

No.

“Director Zhao took a deep breath and turned to look at man Wen. “Mr. President, I don’t understand what you mean.” ”

“Man Wen took out another bill. “Come over and explain to me. Where did the deficit go? Do you really think that just by coming up with a new bill, you can hide it from the world? ! Embezzling public funds, Zhao Shan Dong, how dare you!” ”

“Hearing this, director Zhao’s blood flowed backwards, and his entire body was trembling. ”

“How, how could this be! ”

How did man Wen See Through It?

Plop!

“Director Zhao knelt on the ground, his face pale. “Mr. President... I admit, I admit it all. I was obsessed, please give me a new punishment!” ”

“”Tell me, who are your accomplices.”Man Wen sat down and loosened his tie. ”

“”No, I don’t have any accomplices.”Director Zhao wiped the cold sweat from his forehead and said, “I’m the only one from the beginning to the end.” ”

“Man Wen nodded. “Okay, you’re the only one, right?” ”

“Yes.”Director Zhao said firmly.

“Since things had come to this, he naturally couldn’t reveal his accomplices. ”

“If he revealed them, then he would be finished! ”

“”Good, very good.”Man Wen unbuttoned his cufflinks, “If I remember correctly, chairman Zhao, you should still have a daughter, right. “You’re already so old. It doesn’t matter to you if you live or die, but your daughter’s life has just begun. You wouldn’t want to see anything happen to her, right?” ”

“As soon as these words were said, chairman Zhao’s expression instantly changed. He raised his head and looked at man Wen. “What do you want to Do!” ”

“”I don’t want to do anything,”man Wen continued. “You should know better than me what the crime of embezzling public funds is! If you’re willing to give up your accomplices and make up for it, at least it won’t affect your daughter!” ”
