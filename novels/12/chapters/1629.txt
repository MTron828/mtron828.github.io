“”Well done.”Chen Hao stopped smiling and continued, “But you have to have a solution for both.””

Sun Tian nodded.

Dr. Warne looked at Chen Hao. “Have you thought about going with me?”

“At the moment, humans had only landed on the moon, but this was the first time they had landed on Neptune.”

“If anything unexpected happened, they would never see the Sun on Earth again, and they wouldn’t even be able to bring their bodies back to Earth.”

Chen Hao nodded. “I’ve thought it through.”

“”And US.”At that moment, the door was pushed open and the four Jianghe and Huhai Brothers walked in.”

“And me!”Another figure walked in from outside.

“Yu Zifei!”Cen Hai looked at Yu Zifei.

Yu Zifei walked over and high-fived Cen Hai. “Okay.”

“Cen Hai continued, “But didn’t you say that you weren’t going?””

“”Now you want to sacrifice yourself for scientific research, CAN’T YOU?”Yu Zifei asked.”

“Actually, the reason why Yu Zifei didn’t go before was because of Zhang Pandi.”

“He was Zhang Pandi’s boyfriend. If anything happened to him, he would be irresponsible to Zhang Pandi.”

But now it was different.

“Now that he had broken up with Zhang Pandi, he no longer had anything to worry about. Therefore, he wanted to give it his all and become the first batch of people to land on Neptune.”

“Even if he really sacrificed himself, he would not regret it.”

“Cen Hai said, “Yes, yes, but it’s strange. How did you change so quickly? It’s said that women are fickle, but you are a man!””

“Seeing the cheeky faces of the few of them.., professor Hua en said very seriously, “It’s not a joke to go to Neptune on an aircraft carrier. If we are not careful, we might become space trash! “Please think carefully. Once you board the aircraft carrier, you won’t have the chance to regret it.””

“”Don’t worry, Professor Warne. We know.”Yu Zifei turned to look at Professor Warne.”

The four brothers nodded seriously.

“Professor Warne Thought for a moment and took out a stack of documents. “If you really want to go, sign this document.””

“”Wait! Wait!”Tang mi ran in from outside and said breathlessly, “Me! And Me! Professor Warne, I want to go to Neptune to see the diamonds too!””

Professor Warne handed a document to Tang Mi.

“Cen he looked at Tang Mi and said with a smile, “Good for you, little stutterer. You’re quite aware of your thoughts!””

“That’s a must!”Tang mi said.

“Professor Hua en continued, “All of you have decided to sign the document. Once you sign it, there will be no room for regret.””

“In the end, the few of them signed the document without even looking at it.”

Professor Hua en:”...”

“Cen Jiang looked at professor hua en and said, “Professor, since we have decided to follow Miss Ye to Neptune, we have made all the preparations. No matter what happens on Neptune or in outer space, we will not regret it.”” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Professor Hua en sighed and said somewhat speechlessly, “You young people!””

“Although he was a little speechless, Professor Hua en saw the future of China’s scientific research community in these young people.”

This kind of fearless sacrifice spirit was not something that just anyone could have.

“After signing the document, Chen Hao took a photo of the document and sent it to the group. [ brothers, I’m going to follow our father to Neptune! ]”

“When this news was sent, the group was in an uproar.”

[ I’m so envious! I want to go to Neptune Too! ]

[ remember to take a photo and send it to the group at any time. ]

[ are we really going to achieve diamond freedom? ]

[ I also want to apply to join my father’s research group. ]

[ V587! ]

[ remember to protect our Father! ]

“[ right, right, right, nothing is more important than our father’s safety! ]”

“[ finally, I wish our father’s aircraft carrier a smooth flight and a smooth landing on planet Neptune! I wish our Niu Hulu family to become stronger and stronger! ]”

“Looking at the message in the group, Chen Hao was a little excited. He then replied, [ brothers, don’t worry. I will definitely protect our father! In addition, we have already prepared high-definition cameras. We are ready to give everyone a galactic live broadcast at any time! ]”

...

The launch ceremony of the aircraft carrier was set at 10:18.

Time passed very quickly.

“In the blink of an eye, it was 9:35. There were still 43 minutes before the launch ceremony, and the audience in the square had already arrived.”

Various media outlets also came to the scene to watch the live broadcast.

“Dr. Warne, Dr. Millet, and the Feiyu team had already arrived on stage.”

“The leaders of the six countries — country C, country G, country P, Japan, and Country L — also appeared on stage.”

“As time passed, the launch ceremony of the aircraft carrier was about to begin. However, ye Zao had yet to appear. The live broadcast was very lively.”
