“Si lui placed his hands on Zhao Xueyin’s shoulders, “Xueyin, listen carefully! I signed all the words on this! I signed your name on your behalf. You have no idea about this at all! As for the board of directors, I will explain it to them!””

“As long as he could protect Zhao Xueyin, he was willing to do whatever it took.”

Hearing this.

Zhao Xueyin heaved a sigh of relief.

The lawyer’s backup plan was finally working.

She was really afraid that the lawyer would be indifferent.

“Although she thought so in her heart, Zhao Xueyin still pretended to reject him, “No, brother Si, this matter has nothing to do with you! I can’t be so selfish! You Can’t do this!””

Zhao Xueyin was still so kind.

“If it were anyone else, they would definitely be eager to make him take the blame.”

But Zhao Xueyin said that she couldn’t be so selfish.

He knew that he had chosen the right person.

“Unfortunately, Yang Wenhao didn’t see this scene.”

“Thinking of how Yang Wenhao had slandered Zhao Xueyin yesterday, Si Lui’s eyes showed some hostility.”

“One day, Yang Wenhao would repent for his words and actions and personally apologize to Zhao Xueyin!”

“Zhao Xueyin looked at Si lui from the corner of her eyes, she said, “Big Brother Si, I will bear the consequences of my own actions! I know you want to help me, but I won’t accept your help! I Can’t let you pay for my mistake. The consequences of this matter are not as simple as you think.””

“Si lui turned to look at Zhao Xueyin and continued, “Xueyin, this matter has nothing to do with you. Ye Zhuo was the one who set you up. If it weren’t for her, you wouldn’t have signed this document!”Si lui knew Zhao Xueyin very well, she had never been such a careless person.”

All of this was ye Zhuo’s conspiracy!

“Ye Zhuo first took away what belonged to Zhao Xueyin, and now he used such an underhanded method.”

“If he had not seen it with his own eyes, even the judge himself would not have believed that there was such a shameless person like ye Zao in this world.”

“For fame and fortune, he simply had no bottom line!”

No one knew how Cen Shaoqing fell in love with Ye Zao.

“The outside world said that CEN fifth master was a dragon and Phoenix among men, resourceful and resourceful.”

He saw that Cen Shaoqing was only so-so.

“If Cen Shaoqing was really that powerful, then he would not have been kept in the dark by Ye Zao.”

“Zhao Xueyin sighed, “Although it was ye Zao who set me up, it’s my fault for being too stupid and not being able to see through Ye Zao’s scheme! “Brother Si, forget it. I admit defeat this time! “The Shunxi Financial Group was originally under Elder Ye’s control. It’s only normal for it to be returned to ye Zao!””

“”If it wasn’t for uncle, would elder ye be able to do it by himself? Xueyin, you don’t owe ye Zao Anything! It was ye Zao who stole what originally belonged to you!”Speaking up to this point, the lawyer emphasized, “I’ve already said that these words were signed by me, it has nothing to do with you!””

“If it wasn’t for ye Zao, Zhao Xueyin wouldn’t even have to participate in the election.”

She was the rightful heir of the Shunxi Financial Group.

It was ye Zao who wanted to interfere.

“It was one thing for him to interfere, but now he was using such shameful methods!”

“Zhao Xueyin looked at the lawyer and continued, “But this has nothing to do with you! I Can’t let you bear the false accusation!””

“”Xueyin, do you still treat me as your confidant?”The lawyer looked at Zhao Xueyin.”

“”Of course!”Zhao xueyin nodded and said, “You will always be my confidant!””

“The lawyer continued, “If you still treat me as your confidant, then listen to me!””

“But...”Zhao Xueyin frowned.

“”No buts! Do As I say.”After saying that, the lawyer picked up the documents on the table, “From now on, this matter has nothing to do with you. I will explain it to the board of Directors.””

“”Big Brother Si!”Zhao Xueyin grabbed the lawyer’s hand, her eyes sparkling.”

“The lawyer smiled at Zhao Xueyin, “Xueyin, you’re different from me. You’ll be the chief of Shunxi Financial Group in the future, and I’ll be the chairman of the board. A financial group can have no chairman, but it can’t have no chief.”It was just like how a country couldn’t have no ruler for a day.”

“At this point, si lui paused, “Or, Xueyin, are you willing to let ye Zhuo take everything that belongs to you just like that? Don’t you want to prove to uncle that girls are not worse than boys?””

“”Even if I want to prove myself, I can’t Drag You Down With Me! Big Brother Si... i... I Can’t do this. This is too selfish!”Zhao Xue Yin said.”

“Si lui looked at Zhao Xue yin and said, “I did all this for you willingly.””
