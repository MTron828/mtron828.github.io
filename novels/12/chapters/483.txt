Lin Ze this child is really too insensible!

Others all hope that their father can find happiness.

But he.

Actually opposed Lin Jincheng to remarry.

Lin Ze just looked at Old Mrs. Lin. “Grandma! Did you consider my father’s feelings when you did this?”

Lin Jincheng didn’t like Feng Qianhua at all.

“Because he didn’t like her, Lin Jincheng stayed in the sanatorium all year round.”

“Although Lin Jincheng didn’t say it, Lin Ze knew it.”

“”Your dad and your aunt Feng were childhood sweethearts!”If it weren’t for that fickle woman, Ye Shu, the two of them would have been together a long time ago!”

Why did they wait until now?

“Does my dad know about this?”Lin Ze looked up at Old Mrs. Lin.

“Old Mrs. Lin said, “This kind of thing is consensual! Do you think I can force your dad to do it?” Old Mrs. Lin’s tone softened a little, “Ah Ze! Grandma knows that you’re a good child. You also want your dad to be happy, right? Your Auntie Feng is a good woman and will be a good mother in the future. Grandma hopes that you can respect your dad’s choice.””

“Is this really my father’s Choice?”

“Old Mrs. Lin asked back, “Ah Ze, do you think Grandma Can Force Your Father?””

Lin Ze was silent. He subconsciously felt that something was not right.

Why did Lin Jincheng suddenly agree to this matter?

“Old Mrs. Lin continued, “Ah Ze, you believe Grandma. Your Aunt Feng is really a good wife and mother. Our Lin family will get better and better with her in the future.””

“”But I don’t like her!”Lin Ze continued, “I want her to be my mother.””

“Old Mrs. Lin’s face, which had finally calmed down, suddenly turned cold, she said angrily, “Why are you such a child? Do you have to make me happy? Do you still Miss Your Mother In Your Heart?””

“”Let me tell you! That B * Tch ran away with someone a long time ago! She even gave birth to a bastard! She doesn’t want you! If it weren’t for me, you would have died long ago! Think about it yourself, do you still have a conscience? ! Look at Xianxian, look at you! Ask yourself, are you half as sensible as Xianxian?””

“Lin Ze’s eyes turned red in an instant, unable to control the emotions in his body. “My mother is not a B * Tch!””

“After saying that, Lin Ze turned and ran.”

“Old Mrs. Lin was furious at Lin Ze, but she was worried that something might happen to Lin Ze. If something happened to Lin Ze at this critical moment, the matter between Lin Jincheng and Feng Qianhua would be raised.”

“Thinking of this, Old Mrs. Lin pointed at the two bodyguards beside her and said, “You two follow the young master!””

The two bodyguards immediately followed Lin Ze.

Lin Ze ran all the way.

Tears gushed out.

Lin Ze ran all the way to Lin Jin city’s recuperation room.

Lin Jin city was resting.

“Seeing Lin ze like this, Lin Jin city put down the medicine bottle. “Ah Ze, what’s Wrong?””

“Lin Ze’s eyes were red as he said, “Dad, are you getting engaged to Feng Qianhua?””

“”Ah Ze, I think we might have misunderstood your aunt Feng in the past.”Lin Jin city raised his head.”

“Lin Ze continued, “So, you really agreed?””

“Lin Jin hesitated and continued, “Ah Ze, have you ever thought that Aunt Feng is actually your biological mother?””

“”No! She isn’t!”Lin Ze said emotionally, “Dad, What’s wrong with you? My mother isn’t Feng Qianhua! I beg you not to get engaged to her, okay?””

“”If your mom isn’t your Auntie Feng, then who is she?”Lin Jincheng asked.”

“Lin Ze shook his head, his face full of bitterness. “I don’t know either.””

“Lin Jincheng looked up at Lin Ze. “Ah Ze, do you know how many nineteen years a person has? If your Auntie Feng is really your mom, then I’ve let her down for nineteen years. You Can’t be heartless.””

He was the one who wrote the diary.

And Feng Qianhua had indeed waited for him for nineteen years.

“Everyone around him said that Feng Qianhua was Lin Ze’s biological mother. Now that things had come to this, Lin Jincheng had no choice but to believe it.”

“”So, you want to be with Feng Qianhua because you think that she is my mother?”Lin Ze asked.”

Lin Jincheng nodded.

“Last Night, Old Mrs. Lin almost talked to him all night long.”

Lin Jincheng felt that he should give Feng Qianhua an explanation.

“”But she’s not my mother! Dad, give me some time! I’ll definitely find my mother and let you recover your memory! Dad, I beg you not to give up on my mother, Okay?””

“Lin Jincheng patted Lin Ze’s shoulder, “Ah Ze, I know that this matter is a little difficult for you to digest in a short time. In fact, it’s the same for me. But if your aunt Feng is really your mother, then we can’t let her down.””
