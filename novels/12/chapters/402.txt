Translator: 549690339

Extremely cold!

“Ye Zao took off his sunglasses, revealing a pair of clear black and white eyes that could seduce one’s soul. “Fifth brother, why are you guys here so early?” ”

Ye Zao came ten minutes earlier.

He did not expect Cen Shaoqing and he ziteng to be here earlier than her.

He Ziteng had seen ye Zao on the surveillance camera before.

He had thought that ye Zao on the surveillance camera was already an amazing existence.

He did not expect ye Zao to be so beautiful.

This kind of beauty could not be described with words!

“Cen Shaoqing held the Buddhist beads. “We have just arrived too. Oh right, let me introduce you. This is he ziteng that I told you about.” ”

“”Hello, Mr. He.”Ye Zhuo took the initiative to extend his hand to he ziteng. ”

“He ziteng was stunned for a moment before he held ye Zhuo’s hand. “Hello, Idol! Idol, I’ve finally met you in person!” ”

He ziteng really admired ye Zhuo. He was so excited that he was incoherent.

Cen Shaoqing frowned when he saw the two of them holding hands.

He felt even more regretful for introducing he ziteng to Ye Zhuo.

His head must have been kicked by a donkey.

He was making things difficult for himself.

Cen Shaoqing turned to look at Ye Zhuo. “Shall we begin?”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “Let’s start here and finish at the intersection of Inspiration Road. What do you guys think?”

Cen Shaoqing had no objections.

He ziteng had even less objections.

What could he have against his idol?

Ye Zhuo then took out his phone. “It’s 10:20 now. We’ll leave at 10:22.”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “Alright.”

He Ziteng looked at ye Zhuo’s phone and was stunned.

Her phone case was clearly identical to Cen Shaoqing’s.

F * ck!

There was something wrong with these two people.

They must be hiding something!

“He ziteng’s gaze darted back and forth between the two of them, his eyes filled with excitement. ”

Needless to say.

“The more he looked at the two of them, the more they matched each other. ”

They were simply a perfect match!

10:22 pm.

The two sports cars that were parked at the intersection suddenly rushed out.

Boom —

He ziteng rushed at the front.

Cen Shaoqing followed closely behind.

“Instead, ye Zhuo fell at the back. ”

He ziteng looked at the Black Ferrari in the rearview mirror.

What was going on with his idol?

Was he not feeling well?

“Otherwise, why was he so slow? ”

Or was the idol preparing for a long time?

It should be like this.

“At this moment, a Lamborghini rushed out from he ziteng’s side. ”

Boom!

This was Cen Shaoqing’s car!

He ziteng immediately accelerated.

But the Ferrari behind still showed no signs of accelerating.

He ziteng was very puzzled. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

What the hell was going on?

“The Winding Mountain Road was already halfway through, but the car was still moving slowly. ”

“If this continued, she would lose! ”

This was not how it was done.

Although he ziteng did not want to question ye Zao.

“But at this moment, he had no choice but to question whether ye Zao knew how to race or not. ”

He ziteng frowned.

Boom!

“Just as he ziteng frowned, the black car behind him suddenly accelerated and skidded beautifully! ”

All that was left for he ziteng was the exhaust on the ground!

F * ck!

Amazing!

It was really too amazing!

He ziteng was instantly energized. He stepped on the accelerator and quickly chased after it.

Unfortunately!

He could not catch up at all.

The car in front seemed to be about to fly up.

He was not on the same level as her at all.

Cen Shaoqing saw the car catching up from the rearview mirror and raised his eyebrows slightly.

It had been a long time since he had met an opponent like ye Zao.

“In fact, when he first found out that ye Zao was the person in the video, Cen Shaoqing was also very surprised. ”

It was both reasonable and unexpected.

This person was indeed surprising people every second.

You would never guess what kind of surprise she would give you in the next second!

“At this moment, the black car that was still behind suddenly overtook him! ”

Cen Shaoqing also accelerated immediately.

“You Chase, I Chase! ”

This was a battle between the strong.

Ye Zhuo had not met an opponent like Cen Shaoqing for a long time.

“Looking at the Lamborghini that overtook her, Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly and also began to accelerate! ”

The two cars on the winding mountain road did not give way to each other.

Their blood was boiling!

He ziteng chased after the two people.

He finally understood.

He was just here to be a bystander.

Five minutes later.

Chi —

“The two cars stopped at the intersection of Qi fan road one after the other. There was only a difference of a few seconds between the two of them, ”

the Ferrari was in front.

The Lamborghini was behind.

Ye Zao opened the car door and got out of the car. He whistled at Cen Shaoqing. There was a hint of a bandit’s aura in the air. “Your driving skills are good!”
