“Professor Feng nodded, stood up, and followed director Ma’s footsteps. ”

...

On the other side.

Yunjing.

“After ye Zhuo sent Lin Sha back, he drove to the residential area he had rented before. ”

“At that time, the rent was paid for four years. Seeing that the rent was about to expire, ye Zhuo planned to ask the landlady out and negotiate with her to see if he could buy the house directly. ”

“This was ye Zao’s first home after coming to this world. It carried too many beautiful memories, and ye Zao wanted to keep these beautiful memories forever. ”

“He arranged to meet the landlady in the chess room downstairs of the residential area. When ye Zao arrived, the old lady was sitting at the table playing chess with someone. ”

“On the chessboard, the black and red stones stood facing each other. The red stones were clearly in a state of treading on thin ice. ”

It was either surrender or be killed by the other party.

There was no way to advance or retreat. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Sitting in front of the old lady was an old man with a long beard. He looked energetic and said with a smile, “I think you’d better admit defeat! I’m not bragging, but no one here can break my game!” ”

“”Humph! I’m not admitting defeat!”The old lady looked up at her old friend. “Old Zhang, help me see how to move.” ”

“Old Zhang shook his head. “You’d better admit defeat! This is already a dead end, why waste time here!” ”

“”Landlady Grandma.”At this moment, ye Zhuo walked to the old lady’s side. ”

“”Xiao Ye, you’re here.”The landlady turned to look at Ye Zhuo, “You might have to wait a little longer, I haven’t finished my game yet! Old Man Li, just you wait, I’ll go and find someone right now. I’ll definitely let someone break your game today!” ”

“Old Li sat there and said with some pride, “Go ahead, go ahead. Even if you call a hundred people over, they won’t be able to break my game!” ”

“Ye Zhuo lowered his eyes slightly and saw the situation on the chessboard clearly. He said with a smile, “Landlady Grandma, is this game very difficult to break?” ”

“The landlady looked at Ye Zhuo and said in surprise, “Xiao Ye, you can break it?” ”

Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“Old Li raised his head to look at ye Zao and said with a smile, “Young Lady, you are not young, yet you talk big.” ”

“Old Li had painstakingly studied chess for dozens of years before he was able to develop such a chess game. Even his granddaughter, who worked in the chess club, had solved it for a few days. How could a little girl have such ability. ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled faintly and reached out his hand to slowly jump off the horse. “If you take the lead, no one will be able to open the chessboard.” ”

“The situation on the chessboard, where victory and defeat were already clear, instantly collapsed! ”

Just one move had easily changed the current situation.

Old Li frowned. He did not dare to belittle ye Zhuo anymore and immediately went out to meet the battle!

“Ye Zhuo then moved the cannon away and said in a clear and shallow tone, “General.” ”

Old Li could not care less about the situation in front of him and immediately moved the soldiers to protect the general!

“Ye Zao got out of the car again and said in a clear and shallow tone, “General. This grandfather, you have lost.” ”

“On the chessboard, Hei Zi had already reached the point of no return. ”

The onlookers thought that they had seen wrongly and all of them stared at him with their eyes wide open.

“If they had not seen it with their own eyes, who would have believed that a little girl would actually win against Old Li! ”

One had to know that old Li’s family had quite a few chess experts!

“”Xiao Ye, you’re too amazing!”The landlady immediately cheered. ”

“Old Li stood rooted to the ground, his face full of shock. He had never thought that one day, his chess game would be broken by a little girl. ”

“”Old Li, you’ve lost! hahahaha! Didn’t you say that no one could break your game? Losing to a little girl, how does it feel?”The landlady could not close her mouth from laughing. ”

“Old Li looked at ye Zhuo and continued, “Little girl, What’s Your Name?” ”

“My Name Is Ye Zhuo.”

“Old Li nodded. “As expected, heroes come from the youth! I, Old Li, have never admired anyone. Little Girl, you’re the First!” ”

“”Thank you.”Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “I just happen to have studied chess, you don’t have to take it to heart.” ”

“After saying that, Ye Zhuo turned to look at the landlady. “Landlady, can we go now?” ”

“”Yes, yes!”The landlady nodded. ”

Ye Zhuo followed her footsteps.

Old Li looked at ye Zhuo’s back and couldn’t react for a long time.

The two of them came to a restaurant and were about to talk while eating.

“The landlady said, “Xiao Ye, are you really going to buy my shabby house?”Her house was demolished and divided. The environment in the neighborhood was not that good, and the house price was not cheap, a normal person would not choose this kind of pre-arranged house to buy a house. ”
