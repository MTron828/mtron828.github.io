“Okay.”

The two girls chatted as they walked.

“Cen Shaoqing transformed into a porter and followed behind without complaint. If outsiders saw this scene, who would believe it was real? ”

“Soon, they arrived at the villa. ”

“After greeting a few uncles and aunts, Ye Zhuo distributed the gifts he brought to everyone. ” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Yang Wenyin was an impatient person. She immediately opened the outer packaging, she said in surprise, “This is ZY’s new model that just came out! I’ve wanted to buy it for a long time. I even found a scalper, but this model is really too difficult to buy. Oh My God! Little Twelve, how did you get it?” ”

“Zy had long been popular all over the world. Every time a new model was released, no matter how high the price was, it would be sold out in one go. Even if one looked for a scalper, they would only be able to buy a model that was out of season. Sometimes, it was even difficult to buy a model that was out of season! ”

Who would have thought that the gift given by Ye Zao was actually the latest model.

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “I know people, so it’s more convenient.” ”

“Yang Wenyin said, “That’s great. In the future, if third aunt wants to buy Zy, can she look for you?” ”

“Of course.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“Zhang Zhenzhen smiled and said, “Little Twelve, you can’t favor one over the other. In the future, second aunt will also have to look for you!” ”

“”No problem. As long as you don’t mind it, you can look for me anytime.” ”

“Then it’s a deal!”

“Sun Jiayi came out with a boiled milk tea. When she raised her head, she saw ye Zao standing there talking. ”

“At this glance, she was immediately stunned. Her eyes were full of amazement. ”

“Sun Jiayi had seen ye Zao in the photo album before. She thought that ye Zao in the photo album was in his best condition. After all, cameras now had their own beauty. She didn’t expect that ye Zao in person was even better looking than in the photo. ”

“It was always the photos that were better looking than people. She didn’t expect that in Ye Zao’s case, people were actually better looking than the photos. ”

How could someone be so beautiful?

“”Jiayi! What are you waiting for?”At this moment, Auntie Sun’s voice came from the air. ”

“Only then did Sun Jiayi react. “Mom, is that ye Zao?” ”

“”Yes!”Auntie Sun said in a low voice, “Haven’t you seen her photos?” ”

“But I feel that she’s even more beautiful than in the photo!”Sun Jiayi said.

“She is pretty!”Auntie Sun nodded.

“After saying that, Sun Jiayi saw the ZY air-conditioning clothes with adjustable temperature and said in surprise, “Isn’t that Zy’s latest style?”Sun Jiayi was also a loyal ZY fan, but her financial ability was limited, fortunately, ZY also had clothes with affordable prices. She had never bought a limited edition before, and she had never even seen people around her buy them. After all, limited edition clothes were extraordinarily expensive. She didn’t expect that.., today, she actually saw ZY’s limited edition clothes at the Lin family’s house. ”

“Auntie Sun did not know what ZY was, so she continued, “I heard that the clothes are high-tech and can adjust the temperature when worn. Miss ye bought one for each of them, saying that it’s a new year gift!” ”

Everyone bought one!

“Hearing this, Sun Jiayi’s heart was so sour that it was about to drip water. ”

“If she married Lin Qingxuan, then wouldn’t she also have one? ”

“Now, it was a waste to let Xia Xiaoman and an Lizi, this disgusting mother and daughter, go free. ”

“Xia Xiaoman was also shameless. She couldn’t have children, couldn’t give Lin Qingxuan a complete family, and still insisted on staying in the Lin family. If she were Xia Xiaoman, she would have long packed up and left. ”

She really didn’t have the slightest self-awareness.

They still had the nerve to ask for air-conditioned clothes?

“Auntie Sun patted Sun Jiayi’s shoulder. “Pay attention. Don’t let anything go wrong today.”The people who came today were all Lin Qingxuan’s brothers. If Sun Jiayi were to marry Lin Qingxuan in the future.., then they would be a family. At such a critical time, Sun Jiayi naturally had to leave a good impression on everyone. ”

“Got it.”Sun Jiayi nodded. She carried the milk tea and continued to walk inside. She respectfully placed the milk tea in front of everyone. It was impossible to see her wolf-like ambition.

“”Miss, be careful, it’s hot.”Sun Jiayi passed the milk tea to Ye Zhuo with a fawning expression. ”

“Thank you.”Ye Zhuo reached out to take the milk tea.

“Sun Jiayi continued, “If miss needs anything, just call me directly. I’m Sun Jiayi.” ”

“The moment ye Zhuo made his move, it was a limited edition ZY. Sun Jiayi naturally wanted to build a good relationship with Ye Zhuo. When she became ye Zhuo’s fourth aunt, ye Zhuo would definitely send more good things to her. Looking at Ye Zhuo’s appearance, she knew that.., ye Zhuo was not smart. As long as she casually said a few words, Ye Zhuo would definitely trust her very much! ”

“En.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“”Little Twelve! Little Twelve, come over here!”In the inner room, Yang Wenyin shouted at the top of her voice for ye Zao. ”

“Third aunt.”Ye Zao jogged over.

“Yang Wenyin took ye Zao’s hand and continued, “Little Twelve, I heard that you signed a betting agreement with C Nation and a few other big countries because of the space mothership incident, right?” ”

“”I haven’t signed it yet,”ye Zao said. ”

“It turned out that she had not signed it yet. Yang Wenyin heaved a sigh of relief and continued, “Then why is there so much commotion on the internet, saying that you signed the betting agreement?” ”

“”That’s their way of goading me,”ye Zao continued, “Maybe they’re afraid that I won’t Sign It!” ”

“Once the betting agreement was signed, if the aircraft carrier project failed, Ye Zao would face a huge amount of compensation! ”

“Those overseas people felt that the aircraft carrier plan would definitely end in failure. These days, they had found quite a number of internet trolls to provoke ye Zao. ”

Ye Zao had not appeared all this while. He was arranging for people to draw up the agreement. Betting Agreement. How could she miss such a good thing?

“Hearing this, Yang Wenyin’s eyes widened. “So, you really want to sign it?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “But the content of the agreement hasn’t been drafted yet. It may take a few more days.”

“”Little twelve, this kind of thing is not a joke. You have to think carefully! If anything goes wrong, it will be irreversible!”Yang Wenyin said. ”

“”Don’t worry, third aunt. I know what to do,”ye Zhuo said. ”

“Seeing that ye Zhuo was so confident, Yang Wenyin didn’t say anything more. She just said, “Little Twelve, you just have to think it over carefully. Don’t do anything that you’ll regret.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zao nodded slightly. “I know.”

“Wu Mei stood beside Xia Xiaoman and said in a low voice, “Xiaoman, is there... any movement in your stomach?” ”

“Wu Mei knew that Lin Qingxuan was eager to have a child. The strange thing was that they had been married for so long, but there was no news from Xia Xiaoman at all. ”

“Not yet.”Xia Xiaoman shook her head.

“Wu Mei held her hand and comforted her, “You can’t rush things like this. It’s best to take things step by step.” ”

“”Yes, I know.” ”

“Just then, Sun Jiayi came over with a bowl of medicine. “Madam, it’s time for you to drink the medicine.” ”

“Okay.”Xia Xiaoman nodded.

“Wu Mei said in surprise, “Xiaoman, why are you still drinking the medicine?” ”

“Xia Xiaoman explained, “It’s prescribed by the cautery to recuperate the body!” ”

“OH.”Wu Mei nodded.

“”Madam, you have to drink this medicine while it’s hot. My mother said that it won’t work if it’s cold.”Sun Jiayi urged Xia Xiaoman to drink the medicine. ”

Xia Xiaoman nodded and was about to reach out to take the medicine. “Wait!”

Ye Zao’s voice suddenly came from the air.

Xia Xiaoman looked up at Ye Zao. “What’s wrong with Zhongruo?”

Ye Zao walked over. “Who prescribed this medicine?”

“Xia Xiaoman smiled and said, “Look at your memory, Kid! Didn’t you prescribe this medicine for me?” ”

Ye Zao frowned slightly. He picked up the medicine on the table and sniffed it carefully.

Something was wrong.

Something was very wrong.

“Seeing ye Zao like this, Sun Jiayi’s eyes were filled with disdain. This ye Zao was acting quite well. Did she really think that she was some kind of godly doctor? ”

She could tell that the medicine was wrong just by smelling it?

Daydreaming!

“After a moment, ye Zao looked up at Sun Jiayi. His voice was a little cold. “Did you brew this medicine?” ”
