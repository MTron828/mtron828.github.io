“In his old age, Yu Shaoqing had also looked forward to love. ”

“At that time, he was 15 years old. ”

“But now, he was already 33 years old. ”

Cen Shaoqing looked at Yu Shaoqing. “That’s because you haven’t met the right person.”

“Do you think you’ve met the right person?”Yu Shaoqing asked.

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Yu Shaoqing looked at Cen Shaoqing. “Zixu, you’re not like you anymore.” ”

Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips parted slightly. “I have always been me.”

Yu Luonian frowned slightly. He was a little curious about what Cen Shaoqing’s little girlfriend looked like.

“Your little girlfriend is very beautiful?”Yu Luonian continued to ask.

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Yu Luonian reminded him, “Beautiful women can lie. They are like roses, with Thorns.” ”

“”Your sister-in-law can’t,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

“My sister-in-law?”Yu Luonian looked at Cen Shaoqing in surprise.

Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads. “Isn’t my fiancée your sister-in-law?”

Yu Luonian was no longer calm. “Are you really serious?”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

Yu Luonian looked at Cen Shaoqing in disbelief.

He felt like he was dreaming.

When did Cen Shaoqing become like this?

“The Cen family’s fifth master was one of the most important figures in the Dao. Even in the world, he could be counted on one’s fingers. But now, he was actually defeated by a beauty. ”

“”Beauty’s bed, hero’s tomb.” ”

Cen Shaoqing smiled faintly and picked up his teacup again. He did not speak.

“Yu Niannian sighed. “Zixu, have you really thought it through? Even master suspense said that your wisdom root is very good. In the future, you will definitely…” ”

“Before he could finish his sentence, Cen Shaoqing interrupted him. “That was in the past.” ”

“CEN Shaoqing added, “You will also have such a day.” ”

“I won’t!”Yu Xiannian’s expression was very firm. “Never!”

“At this point, Yu Xiannian turned to Cen Shaoqing. “Zixu, you have seen too few women, that’s why you are attracted to your little girlfriend!”In a world of fancy, what kind of woman did he not want? Cen Shaoqing had always abstained from sex in his early years and was not attracted to beauties. Yu sunset knew that sooner or later, Cen Shaoqing would be deceived by women. ”

He just did not expect that this day would come so quickly!

“Yu sunset stood up from his chair and continued, “There are all kinds of women in the South China Sea, each with their own merits. Why Don’t I take you out to play tonight?” ”

“I advise you to keep a clean body.”Cen Shaoqing glanced at him. “In case you regret it later.”

Keep yourself clean?

“Hearing this, Yu sunset laughed out loud. “Zixu, what are you talking about? You’re not still a virgin, are you?” ”

Cen Shaoqing did not answer. He picked up his cup and took a sip of tea.

His silence meant that he admitted it.

“Yu sunset continued, “So you haven’t touched her yet? Then what fiancée are you talking about?”He thought that everything that should have happened had already happened. ”

“”Do you think I’m like you, sowing seeds everywhere?”Cen Shaoqing retorted. ”

“If it weren’t for the surgery, Yu Luonian’s only son would have already formed a battalion. ”

“Yu Luonian said, “Zixu, you don’t understand the current society at all. With that little girlfriend of yours, she might not be a virgin anymore. You’ve been cheated and are still counting money!” ”Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“According to Yu Niannian’s many years of experience, the probability of a virgin winning the five million grand prize was even lower. ”

“At least, in all the years that he had spent with women, he had never met one. ”

Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly and stood up immediately.

“Are you angry?”Yu Niannian immediately caught up with Cen Shaoqing’s back view.

Cen Shaoqing looked back slightly. “Your sister-in-law is not the kind of person you’re talking about.”

“Yu sunset knew Cen Shaoqing’s temper and continued, “I was wrong. I apologize to you. I am your brother and I am afraid that you will suffer. After all, you have never been in a relationship before.” ”

“Also, this world was always like this. ”

“Cen Shaoqing looked at Yu sunset and continued, “Your sister-in-law and I are each other’s first love.” ”

Each Other’s first love?

“Yu sunset said, “Did she also see through the secular world before?” ”

“No.”Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads.

“Yu Niannian deliberated the words in his heart and continued, “When are you going to take me to see sister-in-law?” ”

He wanted to see what kind of person was able to charm Cen Shaoqing to this extent.

“After all, Cen Shaoqing had always been a calm and wise person. ”

“No matter what kind of person it was, it could not escape his eyes! ”

“You want to see her?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“Yes.”Yu Niannian nodded.

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “I have to apply.” ”

“Apply for what?”Yu Niannian was stunned. He did not understand what Cen Shaoqing meant.
