The other person was wearing a white one-piece dress and had long hair draped over his shoulders. He looked pure and innocent.

“This was the Cen family’s fourth daughter, Cen Yuyan. ”

The person standing beside her was song Chenyu.

“Cen Yuyan walked in with song Chenyu beside her. “Grandma, Mom, eldest sister, second sister, and third sister, I’ve brought Chenyu to see you guys.” ”

Zhou Xiang stood up in surprise. “Chenyu!”

“Song Chenyu hugged Zhou Xiang with a smile. “Auntie, long time no see.” ”

“Long time no see.”Zhou Xiang had always liked song Chenyu.

“When she saw song Chenyu, old Mrs. Cen frowned slightly and thought to herself, this fourth girl is too insensible! ”

Why did she bring this fish on such an important day?

Song Chenyu then greeted Old Mrs. Cen and the Cen Sisters.

Old Mrs. Cen nodded. “Those who came are all guests. Have a seat.”

Song Chenyu sat down and subconsciously felt that old Mrs. Cen was a little difficult to get along with.

“CEN Yuyan continued, “Didn’t Shaoqing bring his girlfriend back today? They haven’t arrived yet?” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen said somewhat unhappily, “You knew that Shaoqing brought his girlfriend here today, so why did you come back so late?” ”

“Song Chenyu said, “I’m sorry, Old Mrs. Cen, this is all my fault! If it wasn’t for my delay on the road, Yuyan wouldn’t have come so late.” ”

“Cen Yuyan smiled and said, “It’s fine, it’s fine. There are no outsiders today anyway!” ”

“Actually, Cen Yuyan’s motive for bringing song Chenyu over today was very simple. ”

She just wanted to see if CEN Shaoqing’s girlfriend was that good-looking.

Song Chenyu was recognized as a once-in-five-thousand-years beauty in the entertainment industry.

Could it be that Cen Shaoqing’s girlfriend could be more beautiful than song Chenyu?

“After all, Cen Yuyan had always treated song Chenyu as her younger sister-in-law. ”

Cen Yuyan was a little unhappy that Cen Shaoqing suddenly found someone else to be his girlfriend.

“Song Chenyu tilted her head and looked at Zhou Xiang, “Auntie, I heard from Yuyan that you’ve been feeling a little unwell these few days. Coincidentally, I’m more familiar with Doctor Gu. I’ve made an appointment with her and will come over in a while to help you take a look. She’s already on her way and should be arriving soon.” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen said, “Thank you for Xiao Song’s good intentions, but my granddaughter-in-law is a doctor. You should let that doctor Gu go back.” ”

“Cen Yuyan hugged old Mrs. Cen’s arm. “Grandma, do you know who doctor Gu is? She’s the second doctor in the country to cure cancer, Gu Deling!” ”

Old Mrs. Cen rolled her eyes at Cen Yuyan.

Was this stupid thing brainless?

Cen Yuyan pretended not to see it.

“The CEN sisters all looked over at Song Chenyu. Since they knew gu dening, it seemed that song Chenyu was indeed not simple. ”

“Cen Yueying looked at song Chenyu. “Miss Song, can you introduce Doctor Gu to me later?”Cen Yueying’s father-in-law had found cancer not long ago. Although he was in the hospital now, it was safer with Gu dening around. ”

“As a professor who had conquered cancer, it was not easy for Gu decing to meet her. ”

“Song Chenyu nodded. “Third sister, you’re too kind. It’s no big deal.” ”

Cen Yueya was also very excited.

“Although she did not really like song Chenyu, she was a fan of the legendary Godly Doctor Ye. ”

Gu decing was the personal disciple of Godly Doctor Ye.

Cen Yueya had long wanted to meet Gu decing.

“At this moment, Cen Shaoqing came out of the bathroom with Ye Zhuo. ”

When she saw Cen Shaoqing.

Song Chenyu was momentarily stunned.

What kind of man had she not seen in the entertainment industry?

“However, it was the first time she had seen a man like Cen Shaoqing. ”

“However, every time she saw him, her heart would beat faster. ”

“When she saw ye Zhuo next to Cen Shaoqing, Song Chenyu was stunned. ”

“Old Madam Cen quickly walked over to introduce her. “Yuyan, this is your future sister-in-law.”After she finished speaking, she looked at ye Zao with a smile, “Ye, this is fourth sister, Cen Yuyan. This girl has been lacking in intelligence since she was young. Don’t be calculative with her.” ”

Ye Zao smiled. “Fourth sister.”

Cen Yuyan was also stunned.

She did not expect ye Zao to be so beautiful.

“If song Chenyu was said to be a beauty that only appeared once every five thousand years, then the girl in front of her was a beauty in the moon, a fairy in the clouds. ”

“Hello.”Cen Yuyan smiled. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“At this moment, Song Chenyu’s phone rang. She picked up the phone, “It’s doctor Gu. I’ll go pick her up.” ”

“I’ll go with you.”Cen Yuyan followed song Chenyu’s footsteps.

“Old Mrs. Cen frowned. She wanted to get angry, but she was too embarrassed to do so in front of ye Zao, so she could only hold it in. ”

She could not let her granddaughter-in-law see her irritable side.

“Soon, song Chenyu and Cen Yuyan came with Gu Dening. ”

“Cen Yuyan introduced to everyone, “Grandma, Mom, eldest sister, second sister, and third sister. This is Chenyu’s good friend, Dr. Gu Dening.” ”

“Cen Yuyan looked up at Ye Zhuo. “Miss Ye, I heard from my grandma that you also know medicine. You must have heard of Doctor Gu, right?” ”
