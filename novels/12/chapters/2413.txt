Translator: 549690339

They hadn’t gone back yet!

“Joseph continued, “You suddenly got sick, so we...” ”

“Sick? I Got Sick?”Susan looked at Joseph.

“Yes.”Joseph nodded.

“Impossible!”Susan was very clear about her physical condition.

“Every time before she got sick, there were signs, like dizziness, and then she would pass out. ”

“But this time, there were no signs at all! ”

“Moreover, Susan remembered that she had only fallen into a coma after drinking a glass of water from Jerry. ”

“So, she definitely did not have any symptoms! ”

It must be the problem with the glass of water.

“Needless to say, it was definitely Jerry’s doing. ”

“Susan continued, “Where’s Jerry! get him over here!” ”

“This time, she would never forgive Jerry! ”

“Joseph still didn’t understand why Susan was suddenly angry, so he asked, “What’s wrong with you?” ”

“Susan continued, “This is all Jerry’s plot! I didn’t fall ill at all!” ”

Susan was very angry now.

“Seeing her like this, Joseph stood up. “Don’t be angry. Calm down. I’m going to find Jerry.” ”

“Go quickly.”

Joseph quickly went downstairs to look for Jerry.

Susan began to pack her things.

She had to return to L continent!

Jerry was watching the news downstairs.

Joseph was too anxious. He almost ignored the news that was playing on the television. He walked over to Jerry. “Your mother has woken up. She’s very angry now! She’s looking for you!”

“Hearing this, Jerry immediately stood up from the sofa. “My mother has woken up?” ”

“Yes.”Joseph nodded. “Come with me quickly.”

Jerry followed Joseph’s footsteps and the two of them walked upstairs together.

“Soon, they arrived at Susan’s bedroom. ”

PA —

“Almost as soon as Jerry stepped into the bedroom, a vase was thrown in front of Jerry and shattered into pieces. ”

Jerry instinctively took a step back and looked up into the room. “Mother.”

“I’m Not Your Mom!”Susan said angrily.

“Seeing the mother and son’s tit-for-tat, Joseph immediately walked forward and whispered, “Susan, why do you have to lower yourself to the level of a Child?” ”

“Ask him what he did!”Susan said angrily. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Joseph scratched his head and turned to look at Jerry. “What did you do?”

“Jerry didn’t hide it anymore and continued, “My mom didn’t have an illness yesterday.” ”

Did not have an episode?

“Joseph asked in surprise, “Then why did she sleep for a day and a Night?” ”

“Jerry said, “I put sleeping pills in the water she drank.” ”

Sleeping pills?

“Hearing this answer, Joseph’s eyes were full of surprise. “Sleeping pills!” ”

“”Yes.”Jerry nodded. “If I did not put sleeping pills in the water, you and my mother would have already arrived in L continent! Do you know what the current situation in L continent is like?” ”

Jerry had been accompanying Susan the whole time. How would he know what the current situation in L continent was like!

Jerry picked up the remote control on the table and turned on the TV.

“[ ... According to our reporter’s report, the current death toll in L continent has reached 56,521 people. Currently, the exotic beasts... ] ”

What happened in L continent was too terrifying. Almost all the television stations were broadcasting it.

“Seeing this news and seeing the appearance of the Strange Beast in the picture, Susan and Joseph were stunned! ”

“”Mom, Uncle Joseph, do you still want to go back now?”Jerry continued to ask. ”

“At this moment, Susan was stunned, and Joseph was also stunned. ”

“After a long while, Susan finally reacted and looked at Jerry. “What’s going on?” ”

“Jerry continued, “Currently, L continent is a living hell! Mom, if you really went back yesterday, you really won’t be able to come back!” ”

“Susan looked at the scene on the news and covered her mouth, almost crying out loud. ”

How could this be?

“It was only one night, how could l continent become a living hell? ”

“Where’s your cousin?”Susan continued to ask.

“Jerry’s expression was complicated. After a while, he sighed and said, “I’m sorry, I couldn’t stop her.” ”

“She... She went back?”Susan asked.

Jerry nodded.

Susan immediately broke down.

It was her fault!

It was all her fault!

“If she hadn’t insisted on going back, Elena would never have gone back. ”

“Jerry saw through his mother’s thoughts and continued, “Even without you, she would still want to go back! There’s no way to stop her. Mom, don’t think too much.”Jerry had thought of many ways to stop Elena, however, he didn’t manage to stop her. It could be seen that Elena had made up her mind. ”

“However, Susan didn’t think so. After all, she was the one who suggested going back first. ”

“Joseph continued, “Jerry is right. This is all Elena’s own choice. It has nothing to do with you.” ”
