“Chapter 1269: 268: China, ye Zao! 4”

Translator: 549690339

Ye Zao had no right to doubt him at all!

“At a time like this, he could not panic, nor could he panic. ”

“Thinking of this, Father Zhao walked into the ward with a calm expression, “A Ye, my son! “Please forgive Dad. Look at your sister. Your sister and her biological mother have been separated for so many years. She has already forgiven Lang Hua. Can’t you pity me? “The tree wants peace, but the wind won’t stop. The child wants to be raised, but the family won’t stay. I’m already in my seventies this year. Do you really want to see dad go into the coffin with regret?” ”

The most important thing now was to make ye Sen accept him!

“Seeing this scene, old Mrs. Cen frowned even more. She pulled on ye Zao’s sleeve. “This bald man is really good at talking!”He kept calling him dad and going into the coffin one by one! ”

Who could resist this!

“More importantly, he even compared ye Shu. ”

“Seeing that Ye Sen didn’t have any reaction, father Zhao continued, “And your sister, Xue Yin. She is your only sister in this world. Do you really not want to see her?” ”

“”I only have one sister. I don’t have a sister!”Ye Sen turned his head and said, “Especially the kind of sister who has no humanity and kills small animals!” ”

Ye Sen watched Zhao Xueyin’s cat abuse video.

“Previously, it was fine if he didn’t know that Zhao Xueyin was related to him by blood. Now that he knew that Zhao Xueyin was related to him by blood, Ye Sen only felt disgusted! ”

“After saying that, Ye Sen continued, “Also, you’re not my father! I haven’t had a father for a long time!” ”

“”Son! Son!”Father Zhao directly sat on the ground, he burst into tears, “You’re asking for Father’s life! I know that Father is a failed father. Not only did he lose you and your mother, but he also failed to teach your sister well. But everyone makes mistakes. Can’t you forgive Father for once?” ”

“”There’s a reason why I didn’t teach your sister well. All these years, I spent all my energy looking for you and your mother. I didn’t have the mood to care about your sister at all...” ”

“”TSK, you’re really shameless,”old Mrs. Cen said directly. “You didn’t teach your daughter well yourself, and now you’re still relying on Xiao Ye. If you’re so capable, why don’t you go to Heaven?” ”

“”Old Lady, you don’t know, but I really have my difficulties.”Father Zhao wiped away his tears, “I don’t blame you for saying that. Those who don’t know aren’t guilty. As long as a ye believes in me, it’s fine. A Ye is my biological son after all. I hope that everyone here can respect his choice. We’re related by blood. In the future, we’re all on the same side.” ”

Once ye Sen acknowledged him.

Then he would be ye Zao’s grandfather.

Who was ye Zao’s boyfriend?

Master five of DK Financial Group.

Then he would be Master Five’s grandfather!

“When he thought of master five lowering his head in front of him and still calling him grandfather, Father Zhao felt extremely happy. ” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Good!

This was really great!

“Although he wasn’t able to become Master Five’s father-in-law, being able to become Master Five’s grandpa was also very good. ”

At that time.

The Zhao family was one of the few existences in the financial world.

Those who fanned the flames and added insult to injury would all feel extremely regretful.

“When he thought of that scene, father Zhao felt extremely happy. ”

“He originally thought that after being kicked out of the financial world, the Zhao family would fall into his hands. ”

He didn’t expect that there would be another bright future!

“In the future, the Zhao family would definitely be out of everyone’s reach. ”

“”A kiss plus a kiss,”old Mrs. Cen pouted. “You really have the nerve to say that!” ”

“At this moment, a nurse pushed a trolley over. “Excuse me, sir. Please make way. It’s time to change the dressing.” ”

This voice...

Seemed a little familiar.

Father Zhao looked up and saw a young nurse.

This nurse...

Why did she look a little strange?

Especially her facial features.

Father Zhao swallowed his throat.

“She, she, she was clearly Mike in disguise! ”

“Father Zhao and Mike had known each other for a long time and knew Mike quite well. No matter how Mike was disguised, he could recognize him at a glance. ”

What was this place?

How dare Mike Come Here!

What if he was recognized by ye Zao?

Father Zhao was sweating for Mike. He raised his eyes and quietly looked at ye Zao.

Ye Zao was looking down at his phone.

He didn’t seem to notice Mike.

It was okay.

It was okay.

Father Zhao was relieved.

“While Father Zhao was looking at Ye Zao, Mike was also looking at ye Zao without leaving a trace. ”

Ye Zao was the first person in the world to cure him of his poison.

He was really curious about what kind of person ye Zao was!

After seeing ye Zao himself.

Besides being beautiful.

“For a time, Mike couldn’t think of any other adjectives. ”
