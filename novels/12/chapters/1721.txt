“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Don’t worry. This photo doesn’t have a beautiful face. Moreover, it was taken by the front-facing camera. The real person is even more handsome than this.” ”

The front-facing camera was also known as the death camera.

“”Really?”Hearing that Lin Weiwei was even more handsome than in the photo, Li Yueyue was immediately interested. ”

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly. “Of course it’s true. Lin Weiwei is the son of my mother’s good friend. She also has an elder sister named Lin Sha. She just finished her college entrance exam this year and will come to the capital to study in the future.”

“Li Yueyue was stunned. “His elder sister? Didn’t he study for his master’s degree? Didn’t his elder sister just finish her college entrance exam? Big Zao, are you mistaken?” ”

“Ye zhuoluo said concisely, “His sister and he are twins. They missed the college entrance exam because of some things, so they were delayed until now.” ”

“”I see.”Li Yueyue nodded and didn’t ask further. After all, it was their privacy. ”

“There were quite a lot of older college entrance exam candidates nowadays, so it was not surprising at all. ”

“Moreover, twenty-three years old was not considered too old. ”

“Then is his family also from the capital?”Li Yueyue asked.

“”No,”ye Zhuo said, “He’s from my hometown, Cloud Capital.” ”

“”Cloud Capital!”Li Yueyue smiled and said, “I like Cloud Capital!” ”

“Then why don’t you two add on wechat first? I’ll Push Your Wechat to him?”Ye Zhuo said.

“Sure.”Li Yueyue nodded.

“Ye Zao opened Lin Weiwei’s wechat and edited the text to explain the situation. Then, he recommended Li Yueyue’s wechat business card to Lin Weiwei. ”

Lin Weiwei quickly replied: [ Okay. ]

“Ye Zao looked at Li Yueyue and continued: “Yueyue, you two chat first. He goes to school in Su City and is very close to us. If you have a common language, you can make an appointment to meet him.” ”

“”Okay.”Li Yueyue looked at ye Zao with a smile after Lin Weiwei’s verification. “If the two of us can really succeed, I’ll definitely give you a big red packet as a matchmaker.” ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Then I’ll remember it.” ”

“”Don’t Worry!”Li Yueyue held ye Zao’s arm. “I can even forget about you as a matchmaker! Zao Zao, I really didn’t expect you to have a matchmaker’s heart!” ”

“Ye Zao said, “It’s a virtue to help others. It’s a virtue to be able to promote a marriage.” ”

“Li Yueyue smiled and said, “By the way, didn’t you say that you were going to the grasslands to play? It just so happens that the holiday is coming soon, and the weather is not bad now. Do you want to go and play?” ”

“Ye Zao Thought for a moment. “I have to look at my recent itinerary. If I’m free, I’ll go and play.” ”

“In his previous life, Ye Zhuo had yearned for the grasslands. ”

“Unfortunately, at that time, the Earth was already covered in wounds. The glaciers had melted, and Mount Everest had been submerged by the stinky seawater. The environment was heavily polluted, so there were no mountains and rivers to be found! ”

“Okay.”Li Yueyue nodded. “Then you can just call me when the time comes.”

“Okay.”

“Half an hour later, the two of them came out of the rice noodle shop. ”

“Li Yueyue asked, “How is it? The taste of this shop is good, right?” ”

“It’s really good.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“At eight o’clock in the evening, Ye Zao returned to the Lin family manor. ”

“Woof Woof Woof –”

“At this moment, a series of dog barks suddenly came from the living room. ”

“Ye Zao looked at the round lump on the ground and asked in surprise, “Where did the dog come from?” ”

The Little Puppy kept barking at Ye Zao as it took a few steps back.

“”Da Zao Zao, you’re back!”Xiao Bai walked out of the house. “Silly Rollie, shut up! This is our Father Zao!” ”

The little puppy seemed to understand Xiao Bai’s words and immediately stopped barking.

“Ye Zao continued, “Did you raise it?” ” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“”MM-HMM.”Xiao Bai continued, “Da Zao Zao, let me introduce you. This is my new brother, Ye Rollie!” ”

“Ye Zhuo half-squatted down, picked up the little puppy, and said with a smile, “He’s quite cute.” ”

“”Of course he’s cute!”Little White said with a proud face, “Why don’t you see who named him?” ”

“Ye Zhuo chuckled, “You’re really getting more and more narcissistic!” ”

“”Of course!”Little White placed its hands on its hips. “He’s like father, like Son!” ”

Ye Zao:”...”it was implied.

“”Zao Zao is back.”At this moment, Ye Shu came down from upstairs. ”

“Mom.”Ye Zao looked back slightly.

“Ye Shu continued, “Have you eaten? If you haven’t eaten, I’ll ask the kitchen to cook for you.” ”

“I have.”Ye Zao carried the Little Puppy and walked to Ye Shu’s side. “I went to eat with my classmates.”

“OH.”

“”By the way, let me tell you something.”Ye Zao seemed to remember something. ”
