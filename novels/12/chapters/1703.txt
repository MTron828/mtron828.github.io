It was getting late after playing a few games.

Ye Zhuo said goodbye to Cen Shaoqing and logged off. He said goodbye to Zhou Yuelian and Lin Jinshui.

Lin Jinshui picked up the car keys. “It’s getting late. Sha Sha and I will send you back.”

“Yes.”Lin Sha stood up as well.

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “No need, uncle. Sister Sha Sha, I drove here.” ”

“”It’s already past eleven. You’re a girl. What if something happens to you?”Zhou Yuelian walked out of the kitchen, “Let your uncle and Sha Sha send you back. Zao, didn’t you see the news that many young girls are being abused? If we don’t send you back safely, your uncle and I will be worried.” ”

“Seeing Zhou Yuelian like this, ye Zhonghua had no choice but to let Lin Jinshui and Lin Shasha send her back. ”

The three of them walked out of the building and saw a car parked downstairs.

“Although the light at night was not very good, ye Zhonghua still felt that this car was somewhat familiar. ”

Why did it look like Cen Shaoqing’s car?

Or was she hallucinating?

“Just then, the car door was opened and a slender figure walked out. “Leader.” ”

“It’s really you?”Ye Zao was a little surprised. “When did you come?”

“”I arrived when I was playing games with you.”As soon as he finished speaking, Cen Shaoqing greeted Lin Jinshui again. “Uncle.” ”

“Perhaps it was because he had been in a high position for many years, Lin Jinshui was still a little stunned when she saw Cen Shaoqing. She did not dare to call herself an elder and nodded. “Mr. Cen.” ”

“After saying that, Lin Jinshui turned to look at ye Zao. “Zao Zao. Since Mr. Cen is here, Sha Sha and I won’t send you back.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“Lin Sha instructed, “The light is not good at night. Drive safely on the road.” ”

“After watching the Maybach disappear into the air, the father and daughter walked into the house. ”

“There weren’t many people on the road at night, so the car was very fast. ”

Ye Zhuo sat in the passenger seat. “Why didn’t you tell me you were coming to Yun Jing?”

“I wanted to give you a surprise.”Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips opened slightly.

Ye Zhuo chuckled. Cen Shaoqing reminded her of the CEN Shaoqing she had first met.

“At that time, Cen Shaoqing was still an unmarried man. ”

The CEN Shaoqing now was at two extremes compared to the past.

“What are you laughing at?”Cen Shaoqing asked. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“”Nothing,”ye Zao denied. ”

“I saw everything.”

“Why are you looking at me?”Ye Zao asked.

“You look good.”

“Ye Zao turned his eyes slightly and his gaze fell on his hand that was holding the steering wheel. In fact, ye Zao controlled his hand a little. Every time he saw Cen Shaoqing’s hand, he could not help but want to touch it. “Watch the road.” ”

Cen Shaoqing immediately sat up straight and looked straight ahead.

“”Lend me your Buddha beads to have a look,”ye Zao continued. ”

Cen Shaoqing’s Buddha beads were usually not very precious. Old Lady Cen could not even touch them even if she wanted to.

But Ye Zao had special privileges with Cen Shaoqing.

“Not to mention a bunch of Buddha beads, even if it was the moon in the sky, as long as ye Zao opened his mouth, Cen Shaoqing would do everything he could to satisfy her. ”

“The next second, the Buddhist beads were handed to ye Zao. ”

“The Buddhist beads were made of rosewood, and they still carried his body temperature. Perhaps it was because they had been worn for a long time, but the surface of the beads was polished smooth and shiny. ”

Cen Shaoqing glanced sideways.

“Ye Zao’s skin was very white, and the wine-red tassels twirled around her hands. It was so white that it was dazzling. Cen Shaoqing’s sexy Adam’s apple could not help but roll. ”

“Has this Buddha Pearl of yours been around for more than ten years?”Ye Zao asked.

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “Sixteen years.”

“The next second, Cen Shaoqing took out a can of iced coke from the car refrigerator and pulled the ring open with one hand. ”

The cold liquid entered his throat and very well resolved the Heat in his body.

The speed of the car was very fast.

“Ten minutes later, the car stopped at the entrance of the residential unit. ”

Cen Shaoqing and ye Zao got off the car one on the left and the other on the right.

“Ye Zao said, “It’s getting late tonight. Why Don’t you just sleep at my house instead of going back to 9 pm?” ”

“”Sure.”Cen Shaoqing held ye Zao’s hand and the two of them walked into the house together. “Then, does this count as me getting into the real world?” ”

Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly. “Don’t forget that you’re still in the internship period.”

“”I’m still in the internship period?”Cen Shaoqing looked at Ye Zao, his deep eyes filled with surprise. ”

Ye Zao nodded slightly. “When did I announce that your internship period is over?”

Cen Shaoqing:”...”

“The door was facial recognition. The moment ye Zao walked to the side, the door opened. ”
