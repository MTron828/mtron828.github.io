“After all, Cen Shaoqing used to be a monk in her heart. ”

She didn’t know when.

He walked into her heart.

“At this moment, Zhao Pingting also came. ”

“However, Zhao Pingting didn’t come alone. Zhao Yingjun and Tang Jia sent her here. ”

Zhao Yingjun and Tang Jia even brought gifts for ye Zhuo and an Lizi.

Ye Zhuo also introduced Cen Shaoqing to them.

“Just like an Lizi’s reaction, Zhao Pingting could not believe that ye Zhuo actually had a boyfriend. ”

“”Zhuozhuo, I have something to tell you.”Cen Shaoqing hooked ye Zhuo’s finger and said in a low voice. ”

Ye Zhuo followed Cen Shaoqing to the side. “What is it?”

“Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips parted slightly. He suppressed the excitement in his heart and enunciated each word clearly. “Just now, you introduced me as your boyfriend in front of your friends. Does this mean that I’ve become a formal official?” ”

“You’re Dreaming.”Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly. “I was saving face for you in front of outsiders.”

Not becoming a formal official?

Cen Shaoqing felt that he had suffered a serious blow!

“After saying that, Ye Zhuo tiptoed and helped Cen Shaoqing straighten his collar. “If you want to become an official, then perform well. Don’t think about taking shortcuts all day. Where in the world are there so many shortcuts for you to take?” ”

“His jade-like facial features were right in front of him. As long as he stretched out his hand, he would be able to hug her. ”

“In fact, Cen Shaoqing really wanted to do that. ”

But... he did not dare.

“After all, he was just an intern. ”

What if it was too reckless and scared ye Zhuo?

“”Alright, I Won’t talk to you anymore. Time’s up, I’ll leave first.” ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Ye Zhuo, an Lizi and Zhao Pingting walked into the boarding gate together. ”

Not long after.

A private plane took off from the airport.

“Four and a half hours later, the three of them arrived at Yunjing Airport. ”

“As it was the start of the school season, all the schools arranged buses to pick them up outside the airport. ”

An Lizi and Zhao Pingting followed the buses of all the schools and left. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The three of them made an appointment to meet again after the military training was over.

Ye Zhuo sent a wechat message to tell Cen Shaoqing that he had arrived.

“Cen Shaoqing replied almost instantly, [ wait for me for a while, we are almost there. ] ”

“In fact, the CEN sisters had already arrived at the airport, but Cen Shaoqing was afraid that the four sisters’enthusiasm would scare ye Zhuo, so he did not tell them. ”

“My mom and uncle are coming to pick me up. Let’s meet again when I get to school.”

“”Okay, be safe on the way.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing had just replied to wechat when old Mrs. Cen came over and asked, “Is this from my granddaughter-in-law?” ”

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“My granddaughter-in-law has arrived?”

Cen Shaoqing continued to nod.

“Old Mrs. Cen became anxious when she heard this. “Xiao Li, quickly go and ask the pilot how long it will take to reach the airport! We can’t let Yezi Wait Too Long!” ”

“Cen Shaoqing explained, “Grandma, don’t be anxious. Ye Zhuo’s mother and uncle have already come to pick her up.” ”

“I see...”Old Mrs. Cen sighed in disappointment.

On the other side.

Ye Zao had just walked out of the airport when he saw ye Sen and ye Shu standing there waiting for her.

“”Mom, Uncle!” ”

Ye Zao jogged over.

Ye Sen directly carried her suitcase.

“Ye Shu said, “Zao Zao, you’ve been on the plane for such a long time. Are You Tired?” ”

“No.”

“Then let’s go eat first. We’ll go home after we finish eating.”

“Ye Shu came in a hurry and had too many things on her hands, so she was not in a hurry to buy a house. She got her assistant to rent a house in the city center. ”

“After finding a restaurant and eating, Ye Zhuozhuo returned to his new home. ”

It was a house with three bedrooms and one living room.

“Just like when she was in Yun Jing, there was a small garden in front of it. ”

“Ye Zao planned to live like this for the time being. After the military training ended, she would go to see the manors in the wealthy district. ”

“The next day, Ye Shu sent ye Zao to school. ”

“Ye Zao refused, but ye Shu insisted on sending her. She could not refuse at all. ”

“Originally, Ye Sen was going to send her, but because of a temporary situation at the company, he did not go with her. ”

Lin Ze and Feng Xianxian also came to the school to report today.

Old Madam Lin asked Feng Qianhua to send Lin Ze and Feng Xianxian to school together.

Coincidentally.

Feng Xianxian and Lin Ze also applied for Beijing University.

“Lin Ze was very disgusted with Feng Qianhua and her mother. “Grandma, I can go to school alone. You Don’t have to send me off.” ”

“Old Madam Lin said, “Your father’s health isn’t good. Today is your first day at university. I have to send you off!” ”

“In fact, Mrs. Lin was worried that Lin Ze had no intention of going to Beijing University. ”

“Because in the beginning, Lin Ze had filled in the provinces. ”
