“As soon as they hung up the phone, buttface and fat tiger walked over with ill intentions. “Hehehe... Brother Ze, what’s the situation?” ”

“Lin ze said calmly, “What’s the situation?” ”

“I heard a voice. Why did it seem like a girl was talking to you just now?”Buttface said.

“”You heard wrong,”Lin ze said. ”

“Did I really hear wrong?”Fat Tiger Laughed Evilly. “I also heard that girl ask you to meet her at the rose at six o’clock in the evening.”

“”The Rose?”Hearing this, Li Wen immediately walked over from the side and said in surprise, “Who wants to meet who at the Rose?” ”

The Rose was obviously a sacred place for couples to date.

Fat Tiger and dog two had evil smiles on their faces.

Only Lin Ze looked at them seriously.

“Seeing the three of them like this, Li Wen was even more curious. “Who is it! Which one of you three secretly has a dog outside behind my back?” ”

“Lin Ze continued, “It’s nothing. Don’t listen to their nonsense.” ”

“Really?”

“”Of course it’s fake!”Fat tiger continued, “I just heard someone ask brother Ze to have a meal at the date with the Rose.” ”

Fat Tiger emphasized the words ‘rose date’.

“”Fat Tiger heard it with his own ears, and you still want to deny it?”Li Wen looked at Lin Ze. ”

“Lin Ze said, “It’s just a meal. Don’t think too much about it. She and I are just ordinary friends.” ”

“”Ordinary friends for a meal at the rose date?”dog two continued, “Brother Ze, do we look like idiots?” ”

“After saying this, dog two held Li Wen’s hand. “Mozzie, let’s go to the rose after work for dinner.” ”

“Li Wen had goosebumps all over his body. He immediately shook off dog two’s hand. “Rephrasing words, disgusting! Who Wants to go to the rose with you for dinner!” ”

Fat Tiger was extremely amused by the two of them.

“”Brother ZE, if you confess, we’ll be lenient. If you resist, we’ll be strict. What’s the relationship between that girl and you?”Li Wen turned to look at Lin Ze. ”

“”We’re just friends,”Lin ze replied. ”

“”Brother Ze, that’s not interesting. Are We Still Your Good Brothers?”Fat Tiger came over and hooked his arm around Lin Ze’s neck. ”

Dog two immediately walked over and hooked its arm around Lin Ze’s left neck.

“Li Wen stood in front of Lin Ze and stared into his eyes without blinking. “If you confess, we’ll be lenient. If you resist, we’ll be strict.” ”

Lin Ze:”...”

“”We’re really just ordinary friends,”Lin ze said helplessly. “Is it weird for ordinary friends to go to the rose date for dinner?” ”

“Then do you think it’s weird for a grown man to go shopping in a pink dress?”Li Wen asked.

Lin Ze touched his nose. “Of course it’s weird.” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Then it’s also weird for you to go to the rose date with an ordinary friend!”Li Wen said.

Lin Ze frowned without a trace.

“However, he didn’t hate this feeling. ”

“Fat tiger smiled and said, “Brother ZE, just confess!” ”

“”That’s right, that’s right,”dog two said. “Brother Ze, you’re already so old. It’s normal for you to have a girlfriend. However, I’m just a little curious. What does sister-in-law look like? She can actually conquer a straight man like you.” ”

“When he said “Sister-in-law,”Lin Ze’s ears turned red. ”

This feeling was almost subconscious.

It was... a little strange.

“”TSK, TSK, tsk. Your ears are red, and you still say that you’re not a boyfriend and girlfriend.”dog two continued, “Brother Ze, I didn’t see it. Why are you still blushing like a big girl?” ”

“”Don’t talk nonsense. We’re really just ordinary friends,”Lin ze said. ”

“”Alright, Alright, Alright. We’re just ordinary friends, Alright!”Dog two looked at fat tiger and Li Wen. “Mozzie, Fat Tiger, listen up. Brother Ze and his girlfriend are just ordinary friends. You two are not allowed to joke around anymore, Alright?” ”

“”Alright, Alright!”The two nodded perfunctorily. ”

“Lin Ze immediately felt a headache coming on. He wanted to explain something, but he was unable to. ”

“In the blink of an eye, it was 5:30 pm. ”

“Lin Ze had always been a punctual person. He checked and found that it would take about ten minutes to get to rose from the studio. With the traffic jam, half an hour was more than enough time. ”

“Therefore, after making arrangements for the rest of his work, Lin Ze went to the underground parking lot and drove away. ”

“Seeing Lin ze leave, buttface, fat tiger, and Li Wen immediately followed. ”

“”Buttface, slow down. Don’t let brother Ze find you.” ”

“Don’t worry.”Buttface held the steering wheel with one hand and whistled. “I’m good.”
