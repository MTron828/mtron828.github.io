Chapter 855: 188: Yezi is so handsome! 1

Translator: 549690339

“[ F * ck, Yezi is so handsome. ]”

“[ video recording, video recording! ]”

[ this voice sounds like a queen. ]

“[ I, Yezi, AM awesome. ]”

Little Yu’er’s expression did not change.

She felt that ye Zao was too conceited.

“In the current situation, ye Zao could not save himself.”

She was going to lose for sure!

The bullet comments on Little Yu’er’s side were also very interesting.

“[ sister Yi is already at the end of her life, and she’s still pretending! ]”

[ sister Yi’s position is gone. ]

“[ I’m dying of laughter, someone like her still wins. ]”

“[ I thought sister Yi was very powerful, but I didn’t expect her to lose to our little Yu’er. ]”

“[ sister Yu, you can do it! ]”

“[ sister Yu, V587! ]”

[ punch sister Yu’s time card crazily. ]

“Little Yu’er’s fans were all crazier. They were still not satisfied with sending bullet comments in Little Yu’er’s live stream room, but they actually climbed over the wall and came to ye Zao’s side.”

[ a certain elder sister’s position is gone. ]

[ hahaha! ]

“[ it’s a little embarrassing. If I Were you, I would just find a hole in the ground and hide. ]”

[ one move to defeat the enemy? I think it’s certain death! ]

“[ you’re not as good as her, yet you’re still not being modest. You’re Really Shameless! ]”

“[ it’s already so late, yet you’re still so proud. If you apologize to our little sister Yu Now, our little sister Yu can consider letting you die a less ugly death. ]”

“[ fish fans, please take care of yourself, okay? This is Leaf’s live stream room! ]”

[ apologize to leaf! ]

[ a bunch of lunatics. ]

“[ leaf, ignore them. ]”

“[ really, what kind of idol has what kind of fans. A certain elder sister has already lost so badly, yet she’s still licking the dog! Disgusting licking the dog! ]”

[ I should call her second elder sister. ]

“[ yes, yes, yes, licking the dog is too disgusting. ]”

“Seeing that the gunpowder on the bullet screen was getting stronger, ye Zao glanced at the screen and said in a flat tone, “Babies, don’t be angry. As the saying goes, don’t argue with a fool. Daddy loves teaching people!””

[ Love Ye! ]

“[ Father Ye, you can do it! ]”

“[ ye is right, don’t argue with a fool. ]”

[ I Knew Ye wasn’t the kind of person who was afraid of trouble. ]

[ you’re the kind of person who teaches others how to Behave! ]

[ I think it’s more like you’re embarrassed. ]

Teach others how to behave?

Who taught whom to behave?

“”Senior, I’m going to be a general.”Little Yu’er raised her eyes slightly.”

“On the screen, Ye Zhuo’s face couldn’t be seen. He could only see a pair of beautiful hands controlling the keyboard and mouse. However, from these hands, one could see how the owner of the hands looked like a city-toppling beauty.”

A clear and shallow voice came from the other end of the screen. “Are you sure you can be a general?”

“It was clearly a very soft voice, but it made little Yu’er stunned. “My Car ate your elephant. Your General had nowhere to go and could only be my general.””

“Take a closer look.”

Little Yu’er carefully looked at the situation on the chessboard. Only then did she realize that ye Zao’s remaining cannon was waiting for her to move the car away.

The car could not leave.

“But if the car did not leave, the car would be eaten. Ye Zao would still be the general in the next step.”

“In the blink of an eye, Little Yu’er became the person who was caught in a dilemma.”

The bullet screen immediately exploded.

“[ holy shit! Leaf is awesome! The opposite party, does this feel good to teach a person a lesson? ]”

“[ second brother in ten thousand years still wants to turn the tables? With our father ye around, you will never be the boss! ]”

“[ hahaha, I’m dying of Laughter. -RSB-”

[ where are those people who were jumping up and down just now? Why are they gone? ]

[ I knew that Ye Zi wouldn’t let us down. ]

“[ Ye Zi is still me, Ye Zi! ]”

“[ upstairs, you should say that your father is still your father. ]”

[ Ahhh! My whole body is exploding! ]

“-LSB- damn, it’s so hot. ]”

“[ do you still remember Ye Zi’s classic saying? Unless father doesn’t want to win, no one can let father lose. ]”

[ kneel down for Daddy. ]

“-lDaddyaYey ye, please accept my knees. ]”

[ Daddy Ye is still your Daddy Ye. ]

“[ I didn’t like chess at first. After watching Daddy Ye’s live broadcast, I signed up for a chess training class. I’m going to enter the Chess Association soon. Everyone, please give me your blessings. ]”

-lDaddyaYey ye is the faith in my life! ]

Little Yu’er didn’t expect that the final situation would turn out like this.

She had always thought that she would win.

“Even now, she felt that all of this was incredible.”

How did she lose?

“Other than being eaten by ye Zhuo, what was wrong with her?”

The smile on Little Yu’er’s face almost could not be maintained.

“Because she had watched ye Zhuo play chess, Little Yu’er thought that she knew ye Zhuo’s tricks very well.”

“She did not expect that ye Zhuo, who seemed to be nonchalant, would always fall into her trap. In fact, when she fell into the trap, she was also setting traps.”

She had been careless.

She had been so focused on setting up a trap for ye Zao that she had forgotten about the danger.

“Little Yu’er raised her head to look at the camera, trying to make her expression look more natural. “Senior Ye, it’s my fault that I’m not as good as you.””

Ye Zao’s tone was indifferent. “Winning and losing is the norm in war. It’s nothing.”

“As soon as he said that, Ye Zao’s voice sounded again, “Although fans are fans and idols are idols, the two can not be tied together. “But I just checked. The person who attacked me and my fans in my live broadcast room is the manager of your fan group. I have memorized the ID numbers of those people. I will send them to you in a while. “I hope that after the broadcast, I can see them apologizing to us on Miao Yin!”” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Ahhhh! Ye Zao is such a fan!”

“”Father Ye, I love you!””

“I didn’t expect ye Zao to stand up for us.”

“Father ye is so warm.”

“Little Yu’er didn’t expect ye Zao to say such a thing. She braced herself and said, “Okay, senior, I got it.””

“That’s it.”Ye Zao was about to reach out and cut off the microphone.

“”Senior, Wait a moment,”little Yu’er continued to say.”

“What’s Wrong?”

“Little Fish said again, “Senior, let’s add each other as friends. Next time, we’ll ask for chess skills.””

“There won’t be a next time.”

“After saying this, Ye Zao didn’t wait for little fish to speak and directly cut off the wheat.”

[ ye is so tough! ]

[ I like people like Ye. ]

“[ ye, from now on, I’ll be your brain-dead fan. ]”

“Ye Zao livestreamed a game, then turned off the livestream and went to take a shower.”

“In the morning, Ye Shu picked a lot of fresh rose petals and sent them over. At this time, she just happened to take a bath in rose petal essential oil.”

Good skin also needed to be managed.

“Otherwise, no matter how good the skin was, it would become riddled with holes.”

“At ten o’clock the next morning, ye Zao arrived at the old place that Li Shang mentioned on time.”

It was a cafe near Beijing University.

“When ye Zhuo arrived, Li Shang was already sitting by the window, waiting for her. It seemed that he had been here for a while.”

“Seeing ye Zhuo come over, Li Shang quickly stood up. “Director Ye.””

“Uncle Li.”
