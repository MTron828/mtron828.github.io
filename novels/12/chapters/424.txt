He was very confused.

What Happened Tonight?

Why did so many people miss him?

Cen Shaoqing looked at Ye Zao. “Then can I call you Zao Zao during my internship?”

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“”Then if I perform well, can I end my internship early?”Cen Shaoqing continued to ask. ”

Ye Zao continued to nod.

“At this moment, Cen Shaoqing seemed to have suddenly remembered something. “Oh Right, Zao Zao, I also prepared a gift for you.” ”

“What Gift?”Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly.

“Come with me.”Cen Shaoqing very naturally reached out his hand that was holding the Buddha beads to ye Zao.

Ye Zao did not hesitate and handed over his hand.

Since she had already decided to be together with Cen Shaoqing.

Then she had to experience the feeling of being in love.

“His palm was very big and his knuckles were long and slender, completely wrapping her hand in his palm. Long beads and tassels poured out from their tightly clenched hands. ”

This was the first time Cen Shaoqing held a girl’s hand.

It was very soft.

It was as if there were no bones.

Was it not the first time for ye Zhuo?

She could even feel a layer of calluses on the pulp of Cen Shaoqing’s fingers.

This was a sign that he often exercised and held a gun.

“The two of them walked on the bustling street. The beautiful neon lights pulled each other’s figures very, very long. ”

“Cen Shaoqing led ye Zao all the way to the front of a beautifully decorated shop. “Zao Zao, look.” ”

Ye Zao looked up.

“At this moment, the red cloth hanging on the plaque in the middle of the shop also fell down. ”

On the dark plaque were five big words.

Qing Zao Dessert.

“You own this shop?”Ye Zao tilted his head and looked at Cen Shaoqing.

“Cen Shaoqing held her hand tightly, afraid that she would leave him in the next second. “The supreme leader is you.” ”

“Do you like it?”Cen Shaoqing asked again.

“”It’s not bad,”ye Zhuo answered. ”

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “Can I get extra points?” ”

“”Then I’ll add 0.5 points,”ye Zhuo said. ”

“Then what’s the full score?”

“100 points.”

“Cen Shaoqing felt that he had seen hope. “Then does that mean that if I add 100 points, I can become an official?” ”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “You’re a promising child.”

“Then follow me. I still have something to give you.”

“Cen Shaoqing brought ye Zhuo to the front of the car. “Leader, close your eyes first. I have a surprise for you.” ”

Ye Zhuo closed his eyes.

He was thinking about those romantic confession scenes in idol dramas.

It was so romantic that his heart was bubbling.

“Although Cen Shaoqing looked like a monk, he really did have the same sense of ritual that he should have. ”

“After a while, CEN Shaoqing said, “Leader, you can open your eyes now.” ”

Ye Zao slowly opened his eyes and saw Cen Shaoqing holding a black box in his hand. He looked like he was asking the leader to inspect it. Ye Zao reached out to open the box and saw a row of exquisite lipstick inside.

Ye Zao had liked it initially.

Until ye Zao saw the color number of the lipstick.

It was all in one color —

Death Barbie Powder!

“At this moment, ye Zao only wanted to apply all of the lipstick on Cen Shaoqing’s face. ”

“Seeing that ye Zao’s expression was not right, cen Shaoqing asked carefully, “Is there anything wrong?” ”

“”There’s nothing wrong! Cen Shaoqing, have you been kicked in the head by a donkey? Why are they all in Pink? First, it’s the Pink Barbie dress, and now it’s the death Barbie Powder. Are you deliberately trying to anger me? Now, I announce that the 0.5 points I just added are gone! Not only is it gone, but I’m also going to deduct 10 points! After deducting 100 points, just wait to see how happy each of you will be!” ”

Cen Shaoqing held the lipstick box. He was originally expecting ye Zao to praise him and give him extra points.

“Unexpectedly, not only did he not get extra points, but he was also deducted 10 points! ”

Dog He ziteng!

He was dead for sure!

“On the other side, he ziteng sneezed again. He did not understand why all these people were thinking about him that night. ”

Cen Shaoqing gloomily threw the death Barbie powder into the trash can and then seriously apologized to ye Zao.

“After sending ye Zao back, Cen Shaoqing did not go straight home. Instead, he went to he ziteng’s place. ”

“”Fifth brother, why are you here?”He ziteng was a little surprised to see Cen Shaoqing. ”

“Cen Shaoqing was a person who worked and slept regularly. Usually, at this time, he would have already fallen asleep. ”

Cen Shaoqing’s expression remained the same. “I came to tell you that ye Zao has already agreed to my pursuit.”

“Really?”He ziteng was unusually excited. “Does that mean that my idol is about to become my fifth sister-in-law?” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “Speaking of this, I have to thank you. If it weren’t for you making a move for me and telling me that girls like to speak the truth, I wouldn’t have been able to woo your fifth sister-in-law so quickly.” ”

“He ziteng said smugly, “Fifth brother, I’ve already said it before. I’m very powerful! Once I make a move, you’ll know if it’s true or not!” ”

“Cen Shaoqing patted he ziteng on the shoulder. With a pat, he ziteng became shorter until he ziteng was completely sitting on the ground. ”

“”Yes, you’re very powerful! “So, if you meet a girl you like in the future, you must remember to talk about this matter in the proper way. Also, girls especially like pink, especially pink lipstick! “If you give your future partner a pile of pink lipstick, she will definitely be moved to marry you in the same place!” ”

“Hearing this, he ziteng immediately got up from the ground and said excitedly, “Fifth brother, really?” ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “Practice makes perfect. Your fifth sister-in-law and I are good examples.”

“”Okay, fifth brother, I got it!”He was so smart, and with Cen Shaoqing as an example, his future path of chasing a wife would definitely be smoother than Cen Shaoqing’s. At this moment, he ziteng was full of confidence in himself. ”

...

The next morning.

It was getting closer and closer to the start of school.

“Recently, Ye Sen had been planning to move the company’s headquarters to Beijing. ”

Ye Shu was also planning to open a branch shop in Beijing.

Both of them were busy with all kinds of procedures.

“Because of Cen Shaoqing’s confession last night, Ye Zhuo could not sleep all night. He did not fall asleep until three o’clock in the morning and had not woken up yet. ”

At the Cen family’s dining table.

“Seeing that there were only three days left until school started, Old Mrs. Cen was also anxious. ”

“Halfway through breakfast, she put down her chopsticks and looked at Zhou Xiang. “Xiangxiang, why isn’t Ze Yan here today?” ”

“Zhou Xiang immediately understood. “Mom, is there something you need from Ze Yan?” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen said angrily, “Yezi is such a good and outstanding granddaughter-in-law. Some pig’s feet don’t know how to cherish it, so I can only give up my love and continue to Matchmake Yezi and Ze Yan!” ”

“Cen Shaoqing, who was touched by the connotation, raised his eyes slightly and opened his thin lips slightly. “Grandma, we are already together, so you don’t have to think about poaching other people all day long.” ”
