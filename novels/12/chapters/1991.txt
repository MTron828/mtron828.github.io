Translator: 549690339

“According to current human knowledge, humans were the masters of the universe. ”

“Once other people knew that there was a more powerful civilization in this world, it would definitely cause global chaos, and the consequences would be unimaginable. ”

“Therefore, all these years, Cen Shaoqing had kept these things in his heart. ”

“After knowing ye Zao, he originally wanted to return to the ordinary and stop studying these things. ”

“However, Ye Zao was not an ordinary person. ”

“Therefore, Cen Shaoqing picked up these things again. ”

“Since he wanted to investigate, he had to investigate it clearly. ”

“Ye Zao nodded slightly. “I heard that the ship that uncle died in can accommodate more than 1,300 people, right?” ”

“Under normal circumstances, if the ship sank due to bad weather, it would more or less be salvaged. ”

“But so far, Cen Shaoqing had only found a piece of iron sheet. ”

This was very unusual.

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Can you take me to the scene of the incident to take a look?”Ye Zhuo continued.

“Yes.”

Ye Zhuo put the chip back to its original place. “Let’s go now.”

“Okay.”

“The two of them took the aircraft carrier. First, they returned to Cen’s base, and then they took a plane to country Y. ”

“Unlike the speed of light on an aircraft carrier, the flight to country Y took five hours. ”

“When the two of them arrived in country Y, it was already past nine o’clock in the evening. ”

Cen Shaoqing arranged for someone to meet them at the airport.

Ye Zhuo was too tired. She had been sleeping in Cen Shaoqing’s arms for the past five hours.

“When they got off the plane, Cen Shaoqing wanted to carry her out directly. ”

“However, as soon as the plane landed, she opened her eyes. “Have we arrived?” ”

“Because she had just woken up, her voice was still slightly hoarse. ” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“What time is it?”Ye Zhuo continued to ask.

“Cen Shaoqing looked at her watch and said, “9:32 pm.” ”

“OH.”

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “Let’s have a good rest tonight. We’ll set off for X Continent Tomorrow Morning.” ”

“Back then, Cen Haifeng had a shipwreck in the waters of x continent. ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

The two of them walked out of the airport.

“The people Cen Shaoqing arranged to receive them were all foreign faces, but they spoke very standard Mandarin. ”

“”Fifth master, Miss Ye.” ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly and carefully escorted ye Zhuo into the car.

“Soon, they arrived at the hotel. ”

Cen Shaoqing had booked a suite.

There was a master bedroom and a second bedroom in the suite.

“Cen Shaoqing was not used to other people entering and leaving his own place. He personally put their luggage in the room and turned to look at Ye Zhuo. “Leader, you’ll be staying in the master bedroom.” ”

Ye Zhuo deliberately teased him and raised his eyebrows. “Why don’t We Stay Together?”

“Cen Shaoqing’s ears turned red for a moment. “Ancestor, don’t tease me anymore.” ”

He could not take teasing.

Ye Zhuo chuckled. “Why are you blushing?”

Cen Shaoqing glanced at her. “I’m too thin-skinned. I Can’t take it.”

He really couldn’t take it!

“Whenever he thought of that matter, his heart would easily go wild and his face would turn red. ”

“”Alright, Alright, Alright. I Won’t say anymore.”Ye Zhuo continued, “It’s getting late. You can kneel and rest.” ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “I live next door. Call me if you need anything.”

“Okay.”

“Although he had slept for five hours on the plane, Ye Zao was still a little tired. After taking a bath in rose essential oil, he went to bed. ”

Cen Shaoqing was not as relaxed as ye Zao. He first took a cold shower and then drank a large bottle of ice cola before he slowly calmed down.

He never liked things like cola.

But ye Zao liked to drink it.

“As long as it was something ye Zao liked, he would not dislike it too much. ”

“After drinking a bottle of cola, CEN Shaoqing wore a white bathrobe and lay on the chair. Sometimes, he held a buddha bead and lit a cigar with his other hand. ”

“The fresh smell of tobacco was swallowed down, and the hot feeling in his heart faded a lot. ”

“His exquisite face, which looked like a knife carving, was blurred in the smoke. ”

He exuded a noble air.

He did not know what was wrong with him.

“The little girl only said a few words, but he could not control himself. ”

“Thinking of the words he heard in the business world a few days ago, Cen Shaoqing could not help but chuckle. ”

Had he really been vegetarian for too long?

“After smoking a cigar, Cen Shaoqing remembered that ye Zhuo had said that he smoked a lot. He put down his second cigar and went to the bathroom to brush his teeth. ”

It was rare for him to lose control of himself like this.

“Unless, the person was ye Zhuo. ”

At eight o’clock the next morning.

Ye Zhuo came to the living room dressed neatly.
