“As soon as these words were said, someone was immediately unhappy and immediately retorted, “You say that as if Miss Zhao has nothing to do with elder Zhao!” ”

“Although Zhao Xueyin was powerful, if it wasn’t for Zhao Zhenfei, Zhao Xueyin wouldn’t have been able to develop so smoothly in Shunxi Financial Group. ”

“”Anyway, I just think that Miss Zhao is more powerful!” ”

“”Stop arguing!”! I can’t tell who’s more powerful between the two of them at the moment! But it’s true that president ye is more beautiful than Miss Zhao! In the past, I thought that Miss Zhao was beautiful, just like a fairy! After meeting Miss Ye, I finally knew what a true fairy is!” ”

“”Right, right, right! I also want to say! President ye is simply too beautiful!” ”

“Beside the cubicle, a figure in a suit passed by. Hearing these words, his handsome features seemed to be covered by a layer of dark clouds. ”

Good-looking?

Could it be that ye Zhuo wanted to use that face to win over People’s hearts?

He was really daydreaming!

“Did he really think that just because he was good-looking, he could run amok in the world? ”

He was at his wit’s end!

On the 58th floor.

Zhao Xueyin sat in front of her desk and looked at the latest information posted on the official website. Her brows were tightly knitted.

“In the past, if the public relations department wanted to issue a notice, they had to obtain her approval. ”

But today.

Ye Zhuo actually let the public relations department issue it directly.

Those people from the public relations department were also brainless!

Didn’t they know who was the Real Master of the consortium?

Zhao Xueyin’s eyes were filled with anger.

And that Liu Neng!

He was simply a waste! Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

He couldn’t even handle a small matter well!

She originally wanted to make Liu Neng hand in the flawed plan while elder Zhang wasn’t around. Ye Zao would definitely sign it.

As long as ye Zao signed it.

She could smoothly chase ye Zao out.

Unexpectedly.

Ye Zao actually saw through the loophole.

How did ye Zao See Through It?

“If yesterday’s Ye Zao was because elder Zhang was guiding him from behind, then what about today? ”

Who was guiding ye Zao from behind today?

“At this moment, there was a knock on the door. ”

“Come in.”Zhao Xueyin raised her head and looked in the direction of the door.

“A moment later, the door was pushed open and a tall figure walked in from outside. ”

“”Big Brother Si, I was just about to look for you.”Seeing the person who came, Zhao Xueyin immediately stood up from the boss’s chair. ”

“Si lui said, “I already know about Liu Neng.” ”

“Zhao Xueyin continued, “It seems that I underestimated ye Zao.” ”

Underestimated ye Zao?

Did Ye Zao underestimate him?

She was an incompetent person!

“Si Lui’s eyes glazed over and he continued, “Other than you and Liu Neng, who else has read the proposal?” ”

“Zhao Xueyin shook her head and continued, “You suspect that someone read the proposal in advance?” ”

“Yes.”The lawyer nodded.

He had gone to the official website to read the proposal.

“Zhao Xueyin was a very strict person, and the proposal was flawless. ”

“If one was not a professional financial expert, one would not be able to see any loopholes. ”

Ye Zhuoxing?

“If Ye Zhuoxing was really good, then there was no need for his face to be widely publicized within the consortium! ”

Did he really think that the consortium was the entertainment industry?

Therefore.

Someone must have read the plan in advance and told ye Zao about the loopholes.

“Then what should we do next?”Zhao Xueyin followed up with a question.

“”There’s no rush. This is just the beginning.”Si lui said unhurriedly, “President Yu has left so many questions. Let’s see when our new president can handle it properly!” ”

President Yu was also an old fox.

“He knew that he was going to retire, so he piled up all the questions and waited for the new president to take over the mess. ”

There were some problems.

“Not to mention elder Zhang, even if Zhao Xueyin came personally to handle it, it would still be a little troublesome. ”

Zhao Xueyin nodded.

Right.

She couldn’t be anxious now.

“After all, the days were still long! ”

“If she couldn’t handle the problem, even if elder Zhang took action, he might not be able to handle it. ”

On the other side of the 58th floor.

“Ye Zhuo was standing in front of the French window, looking down at the scenery below him. At this moment, a video call sounded in the air. ”

Ye Zhuo picked up his phone and swiped to answer it.

“”Hello, Great Burning!”Little White’s face appeared on the other end of the screen. ”

“”Doggy, What’s Wrong?”Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly. ”

“Whitey took a few steps forward and looked a little aggrieved. “Da Zao, where have you been? Silly cat and I have missed you!” ”

“”Meow!”As if he had cooperated well, brother Meow jumped on Whitey’s head and meowed. ”

He tilted his head and stared at ye Zao with his big eyes.

Little expression is a little cute.
