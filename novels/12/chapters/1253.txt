Translator: 549690339

“After a while, the door of the ward was pushed open. ”

A doctor walked out. “Are You Ye Sen’s family members?”

Ye Shu nodded. “We all are!”

“”The patient continues to receive blood transfusions, but there’s not enough blood in the blood bank. May I ask which one of You Is Ab Blood?” ”

“AB blood was known as universal blood in medicine. It could accept Type A, B, AB and O blood. ”

“However, the current principle of blood transfusion was to infuse the same type of blood. Otherwise, there would be a very serious transfusion reaction. ”

“”I! I’m Type AB!”Father Zhao immediately raised his hand. “I’m the child’s father. Doctor, you can take my blood!” ”

The doctor nodded. “Go over and have a blood test first.”

“Okay! Okay!”Father Zhao quickly followed the nurse to have a blood test.

Ye Shu and ye Langhua looked at each other.

“Lin Jincheng said, “It seems that this uncle is really the biological father of my brother-in-law!” ”

“Ye langhua frowned and continued, “By the way, did you call Zao and Ah Ze?” ”

Lin Jincheng nodded. “Ah Ze is still abroad. He probably won’t be home until tomorrow. Zao is already on his way.”

“Ye Sen was in trouble, so he couldn’t hide it from the two children. ”

“Ye Shu continued, “By the way, Mom, what’s up with that uncle? Are you old friends with him?” ”

“Ye Langhua said, “He’s Zhao Zhenfei.” ”

“”Zhao Zhenfei?”Although ye Shu had never met Father Zhao, she was familiar with the name. “He’s the Zhao Zhenfei who founded the Shunxi Financial Group with Grandpa?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Langhua nodded.

“”This, this is too much of a coincidence!” ”

Ye Langhua’s expression had an indescribable meaning.

She really could not understand how Zhao Zhenfei could be ye Sen’s father!

“Zhao zhenfei obviously only had one daughter, Zhao Xueyin. ”

Strange.

This matter was simply too strange!

“On the other side, after the blood type was tested and confirmed that there was no problem, the nurse brought Father Zhao to draw blood. ”

“”Doctor Li, how much do you want to draw?” ”

Doctor Li looked at Father Zhao. “The old man is getting old. Let’s draw 400cc First!”

“Alright!”

“Hearing this, Father Zhao became anxious. “Draw more! Doctor, it’s Alright! I’m usually in good health! Please draw more of my blood! I only have one son, he can’t Die!” ”

“As long as he could save ye Sen, Father Zhao would not complain even if all his blood was drawn out! ”

“The Doctor adjusted his glasses. Considering that ye Sen’s condition was indeed quite critical, he said, “Then let’s draw 500 cc.” ”

“”We can draw more! Doctor, I’m really fine!” ”

What could 500 cc do?

“Doctor Li said, “Old Sir, I know that you’re eager to save your son, but our hospital has rules! Don’t worry, if there’s not enough blood, we’ll look for You Again!” ”

“After saying that, doctor Li looked at the nurse and continued, “That’s enough, Xiao Wu. Bring this old man to have his blood drawn.” ”

“Okay.”

The 500 cc of blood was drawn very quickly.

“But after the blood transfusion, Ye Sen’s condition did not change. ”

“After a few discussions, the doctors came to the family waiting area and announced bad news. ”

“The patient’s organs have begun to fail. He may only have less than 72 hours left. Your family can prepare for the funeral.”

Prepare for the funeral?

How could this be?

“Upon hearing this news, ye Shu’s vision went black and she immediately fainted. ”

“Ah Shu!”

Father Zhao immediately knelt on the ground. “My Son!” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Then, he hugged the doctor’s trouser leg. “Doctor! I beg you, save my son! As long as you can save my son, I’m willing to go bankrupt!” ”

Come back to life.

Father Zhao only wanted to bring ye Sen back to Life Right Now!

“”Old Sir, I’m sorry, we’ve really tried our best!” ”

“”Doctor, I beg you...” ”

The waiting area was in a mess.

“Under the nurse’s first aid measures, ye Shu finally woke up. ”

“After being unconscious for a few minutes, she felt like she was dreaming. ”

“Is Ye Sen Alright?”

“Seeing ye Shu like this, Ye Langhua sighed. ”

“Lin Jincheng hurriedly said, “It’s alright, Ah Shu! Little brother-in-law will definitely be fine! Our Zhuozhuo’s medical skills are so amazing, she will definitely be able to cure little brother-in-law!” ”

“Hearing that, Ye Shu’s eyes lit up. ”

Right!

There was also ye Zhuo!

Ye Zhuo was so amazing that he could even cure cancer.

She would definitely be able to cure ye Sen!

“Where is Zao Zao Now?”Ye Shu asked immediately.

“Lin Jincheng said, “He should be here soon.” ”
