Chapter 2581: Her eyes reddened with jealousy

Translator: 549690339

She was waiting for the elevator.

There were all kinds of people.

“Nannies, sanitation workers. ”

She had never noticed before that there were sanitation workers living in the same neighborhood as her!

“Nowadays, even sanitation workers could afford to buy a house in Beijing? ”

She was reduced to living in the same neighborhood as a sanitation worker!

“If she was living in a big villa, would she still have to squeeze into the elevator with these lowly people? ”

Definitely Not!

Li hang endured the nausea and discomfort in his heart and walked into the elevator.

She lived on the 32nd floor. Li hang only felt a pungent smell constantly surging into his nose.

It was so disgusting that he wanted to vomit.

“When the elevator door opened, Li Hang could not wait to run out, covering his mouth and retching. ” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

She had to move out of this damn place as soon as possible!

“Li Hang took a deep breath, walked to the door, and rang the doorbell. ”

Ding Dong —

“Soon, the door opened. ”

The one who opened the door was a middle-aged woman with hot instant noodles.

“When she saw Li Hang, the middle-aged woman said, “How is it? Have you seen Xia Xiaoman?” ”

“”Yes,”Li Hang answered as he changed his shoes. ”

“The middle-aged woman looked like she was watching a good show, then she said, “Is Xia Xiaoman living a particularly poor life now? It’s very normal when you think about it. What right does a country woman like her have to marry the big boss of the capital city? In fact, she’s just being used as a nanny!” ”

“The middle-aged woman was Li Hang’s mother, Zhou Cuihua. ”

Zhou Cuihua looked down on Xia Xiaoman and thought that Xia Xiaoman was not a woman.

She had actually forced her husband to his death!

“As a man, it was very normal for him to mess around outside. ”

Those who mess around were usually capable men. How could a man without ability mess around?

Xia Xiaoman was a hag!

“Now that she was being ordered around by her rich husband as a nanny, it was her retribution! ”

“After saying that, Zhou cuihua continued, “Did Xia Xiaoman tell you that she regretted it?” ”

“”No.”Li Hang looked at Zhou cuihua and continued, “Mom, Xia Xiaoman and her mother are living a happy life now. We are no longer in the same world as her.” ”

“What?”Zhou cuihua looked at Li hang in disbelief. “Are you mistaken? But it’s possible that Xia Xiaoman is forcing a smile.”

Who would want to save face in front of others?

“”No.”Li hang shook his head. “She’s really living a very happy life. Moreover, she already has a son with that rich businessman.” ”

“She really has a son?”Zhou Cuihua’s face was full of disbelief.

“Previously, when she heard that Xia Xiaoman had a son, she didn’t believe it. She felt that the rumors were wrong. She didn’t expect that Xia Xiaoman actually had a son! ”

“”I saw it with my own eyes,”Li Hang said. ”

“After saying that, Li hang continued, “Also, did you know, Mom? An Lizi also married into a wealthy family. The man is very well-off.” ”

“Although Ouyang Cheng’s words and actions did not seem to show much love for an Lizi, he was still much better than ordinary people. ”

“How well-off?”Zhou cuihua asked.

“Li Hang looked at Zhou cuihua and said, “Let me put it this way. The man is someone that I will never be able to get in touch with in my life.” ”

That was why the circle was very important.

Friends determined your connections.

Zhou cuihua took a deep breath. “Really? That impressive?”

One had to know that the people who pursued Li hang were not bad either.

There were overseas returnees and self-employed bosses...

“If it was someone that Li Hang would never be able to get in touch with in his life, how outstanding would he be? ”

“”It’s true.”Li hang nodded. “That’s why the circle is so important! Although Xia Xiaoman’s character is bad, she did the right thing!” ”

“What Thing?”Zhou cuihua asked.

“Li hang said, “She married an Lizi into a rich family.” ”

“Previously, Li Hang hated Xia Xiaoman and an Lizi, but now he was envious of an Lizi. ”

“If she was born into a rich family, she would definitely marry better than an Lizi! ”

“Zhou cuihua said, “Don’t be so envious of her yet. Maybe what you see is just the surface. Who knows what kind of life she lives in secret!” ”

She would never be envious of a woman like Xia Xiaoman!

“Li Hang took out his phone and continued, “Mom, come and take a look at this photo.” ”

Zhou cuihua walked over.

Li hang showed the photo to Zhou cuihua.

“”This is where Xia Xiaoman lives now. This is the housekeeper of her house.”As he spoke, Li Hang slid to the next photo and continued, “Look at this room again. Do you know whose room this is?” ”

The European style of decoration revealed a sense of luxury in its simplicity.

“At a glance, it was obvious that this was not the decoration of an ordinary home. ”
