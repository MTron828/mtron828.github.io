“”Yes, it’s the two of them.”CEN Shaoqing continued, “You can introduce them to Ah Ze.” ”

“Ye Zhuo shook his head slightly. “Maybe not. They know my brother. If it could be done, it would have been done long ago.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing seemed to have thought of something and continued, “What about the jasmine flower?” ”

“What Jasmine Flower?”Ye Zhuo asked in confusion.

“”It’s the jasmine flower that ye Han introduced to Ah Ze,”CEN Shaoqing said. ”

“Ye zhuo chuckled, “What jasmine flower? Her name is Bai Mo. but she doesn’t like my brother.” ”

“”Her taste is quite high,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Everyone has their own type of love. Maybe my brother isn’t her type.” ”

“Don’t move!”Cen Shaoqing suddenly straightened his expression.

“What’s Wrong?”Ye Zao looked back slightly.

“Cen Shaoqing spoke slowly, word by word, and said very seriously, “Let me give you a kiss.” ”

“As soon as he said that, he lowered his head and pressed his lips against hers. ”

The atmosphere instantly changed.

“After tossing and turning, no one knew who had lost the city first. ”

“After a few minutes, Cen Shaoqing finally let go of Ye Zao. ” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

His expression was normal. Ye Zao’s breathing was unstable and he was panting.

Cen Shaoqing did not know what he was thinking. His eyes were deep and he could not see the end of it.

“What are you thinking about?”Ye Zao asked.

“Cen Shaoqing slowly opened his mouth and said in a low voice, “I’m thinking about when you will graduate.” ”

“”Yeah, about two more months,”ye Zhuo said. ”

Cen Shaoqing’s lips curled up. “Soon.”

“For some reason, ye Zhuo suddenly felt that Cen Shaoqing was a little dangerous. ”

“He was like a ferocious beast that lurked in the darkness, ready to give a fatal blow at any time. ”

“What are you thinking about?”Ye Zhuo asked lightly.

“Cen Shaoqing glanced at her, and his voice was low and husky, full of magnetism. “I’m thinking about something that is only suitable to be done in a room.” ”

“Ye Zhuo did not want to be a girl who understood instantly, but she instantly understood the meaning behind CEN Shaoqing’s words. She immediately got down from his body. “I still have something to do. I’ll be leaving first.” ”

“After saying that, she left as if she was escaping. ”

Cen Shaoqing looked at her back and the corners of his mouth curled up slightly.

The little girl’s face was getting thinner and thinner.

“After ye Zhuo left Cen Shaoqing’s office, he stood at the railing in the corridor and took a deep breath. Only then did he feel that the heat on his face had decreased a little. ”

“It was precisely when Shi Qingcheng and ye Han walked over from the opposite side hand in hand. “Sister, why is your face so Red?” ”

Ye Han asked curiously.

“Shi Qingcheng also sized up ye Zhuo from head to toe. She clicked her tongue and continued, “Did you do something inappropriate for children?” ”

Ye Zhuo looked at Shi Qingcheng. “It’s broad daylight. What are you thinking about?”

“Shi Qingcheng smiled and said, “We’re both adults, what’s there to be embarrassed about?” ”

“Ye Zhuo changed the topic and his gaze fell on the hand that the two of them were holding. Knowing the answer, he asked, “What’s going on between the two of you?” ”

“Shi Qingcheng was just about to let go of Ye Han’s hand, but was tightly held by Ye Han. “Sister, Qingcheng and I are together!” ”

“Shi Qingcheng, who had always been carefree, blushed at this moment and buried her face behind ye Han’s shoulder in embarrassment. ”

Her heartbeat quickened.

“Ye Zao and the other two pushed each other and teased, “We’re all adults, what’s there to be embarrassed about! But if the two of you succeed, Qingcheng, what should you call me?” ”

“Shi Qingcheng raised her head to look at Ye Zao. “Zao Zao, you’re Bullying Me!” ”

“Ye Han shielded Shi Qingcheng behind him and continued, “Sister, she’s thin-skinned, don’t tease her.” ”

“Ye Zhuo chuckled, “You’re protecting her already? Qingcheng, why didn’t I notice that you’re thin-skinned before?” ”

“Zha Zha!”Shi Qingcheng raised her head to look at Ye Zhuo. “Why are you like this!”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “Alright, Alright. If you don’t tease me, Can I tease you?” ”

“I was just saying it casually!”It was rare for Shi Qingcheng to act like a little girl.

“Ye Zhuo said, “I was just making a casual remark. By the way, are you looking for me?” ”

“Ye Han nodded. “Sister, are you guys going back?” ”

“”Yes,”ye Zhuo said. “We’re preparing to leave tomorrow.” ”

“So Soon?”Ye Han was stunned.

“Ye Zhuo explained, “There are still a lot of things waiting for us to deal with on Earth.” ”

There was also the OASIS Project on Mars...

“Ye Han held Shi Qingcheng’s hand tightly and continued, “Sis, Qingcheng and I are planning to go back with you guys.” ”

“You guys are going too?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“”Yes.”Ye Han nodded. “Qingcheng has always been very curious about what Earth is like. Coincidentally, we don’t have much to do during this period of time, so we can go to Earth to have some fun.” ”
