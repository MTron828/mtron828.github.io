“”Yes, President Ye.” ”

“On the Han family’s side, Mrs. Han was especially happy when she learned that Chen Qiaoye had successfully made an appointment with Miracle Doctor Ye. ”

“”Bodhisattva’s blessing! It’s really Bodhisattva’s blessing!”After saying that, Mrs. Han continued, “Qiaoye, why don’t I accompany you to see Miracle Doctor Ye Tomorrow?” ”

“”No need.”Chen qiaoye smiled and said, “You can just wait for us at home.” ”

“Okay.”Mrs. Han nodded.

“In the blink of an eye, it was the next day. ”

Chen Qiaoye arrived at the entrance of the Chinese Medicine Store on Xichang Road at 10 o’clock.

“At 10:30, Ye Zhuo arrived on time. ”

“Mrs. Yi!”

“”Godly Doctor Ye!”Seeing ye Zhuo, Chen Qiaoye was very excited. “I haven’t seen you for such a long time. You are getting more and more beautiful. I don’t even dare to recognize you anymore!” ”

This was not something that was contrary to her heart.

The current ye Zao was shining with boundless radiance. It was indeed beyond the reach of others.

“”Thank you.”Ye Zao continued, “By the way, can you describe the specific situation of the patient for me so that I can prescribe the right medicine.” ”

“Chen Qiaoye nodded. “My cousin is thirty-six years old this year. This illness started half a year ago. At the beginning, everyone thought that it was just a common cold...” ”

“Who knew it would become so serious later on!”

“At the end of her sentence, Chen Qiaoye sighed deeply. ”

“Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. With an idea in mind, he turned around and walked towards the pharmacy. ”

Chen Qiaoye followed ye Zhuo’s footsteps.

“When they arrived at the pharmacy, Ye Zhuo gave out a list of medicine names. ”

“Very quickly, the pharmacy owner finished preparing the medicine. “A total of fifty-eight yuan.” ”

Fifty-eight Yuan?

That cheap?

“Chen Qiaoye thought that she had heard wrong. “Boss, are you sure it’s 58 yuan?” ”

“The pharmacy owner smiled and said, “Look at what you’re asking. Do you think I can defame you? This isn’t some three-nil illegal shop!” ”

Chen Qiaoye took out the money and handed it to the owner.

“Walking out of the pharmacy, Chen Qiaoye continued, “Miracle Doctor Ye, can these medicines help my cousin recover?” ”

“”We can only confirm this after we see the patient,”ye Zhuo replied. ”

Chen Qiaoye nodded and did not ask further.

“After leaving the pharmacy, the two of them got into the car. ”

“The speed of the car was very fast, and they arrived at the Han residence in a short while. ”

Han Laoshan and Mrs. Han were waiting outside the door early in the morning.

They were looking forward to it.

“Seeing that the car had finally stopped, Mrs. Han said excitedly, “It’s coming! It’s coming!” ”

“Under the expectant gazes of the two, the car door was opened, and a slender figure leaned out of the car. ”

“From Mrs. Han’s angle, although she could only see the side profile of the class monitor, it was still amazing. ”

This girl was too beautiful!

“Seeing ye Zhuo, Han Laoshan was stunned. ”

He thought that he was hearing things.

Chen Qiaoye brought ye Zhuo to the front of the couple.

“Only then did Mrs. Han react. She asked curiously, “Qiaoye, did you not manage to invite Miracle Doctor Ye?” ”

“Chen Qiaoye said, “Auntie, uncle, let me introduce the two of you. This is miracle doctor ye who cured Yi Tao.” ”

“Ye Zhuo said politely, “Old Han, Mrs. Han.” ”

“President... President Ye.”Han Laoshan also reacted at this moment.

“Chen Qiaoye said in surprise, “Uncle, do you know Godly Doctor Ye?” ”

“Han laoshan nodded, “She is president ye of the Shunxi Financial Group.” ”

He never thought that ye Zhuo was the godly doctor who cured Yi Tao.

“Chen Qiaoye said with a smile, “So everyone knows each other! That’s even better. It saves me the trouble of introducing you.” ”

“Han Laoshan continued, “President Ye, come in and have a seat.” ”

“Compared to Miracle Doctor Ye, Han Laoshan was more used to addressing ye Zhuo as President Ye. ”

The few of them came into the house together.

Han Laoshan was busy getting the servants to pour tea.

“Ye Zhuo took a sip of the tea symbolically and said, “There’s no time to lose. Take Me to see the patient first.” ”

Chen Qiaoye went forward to lead the way. “This way.” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Ye Zhuo followed Chen Qiaoye’s footsteps.

“Looking at ye Zhuo who was walking in front, Mrs. Han tugged at Han Laoshan’s sleeve. “Does this young lady really know medical skills?” ”

Ye Zhuo was too young.

“During this period of time, the Chinese doctors who came to treat Han Dongliang were mostly elderly Chinese doctors. ”

This made Mrs. Han a little worried.

“Han Laoshan said, “I’m not too sure either! Let’s go in and take a look first! She was introduced by Tao Tao and his wife. There can’t be any mistakes!” ”

“If ye Zhuo did not have some ability, would yi Tao recover? ”

“However, when Yi Tao was seriously ill, Han Laoshan had gone to take a look. ”

His condition was not any better than Han Dongliang’s Now!

Mrs. Han nodded and followed him to the sterile room.

“Once they entered the sterile room, Ye Zhuo frowned slightly. However, he did not say anything and half-reached out to press on Han Dongliang’s pulse. ”
