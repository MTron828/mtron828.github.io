Old Mrs. Cen opened the gift. “Are you really begging us for Nothing?”

“Cen Yuyan laughed twice and continued, “Actually, there is such a thing, but it’s not a big thing. It’s just a small thing.” ”

“”I knew it wasn’t that simple.”Old Mrs. Cen put down the things in her hands. “Tell me, what is it?” ”

“Hearing this, the smile on Zhou Xiang’s face faded a little. ”

She originally thought that Cen Yuyan had grown up.

She didn’t expect that old Mrs. Cen was right.

“Cen Yuyan continued, “Grandma, look at our family. There are only four people every year during the New Year. It’s really too boring! It’s not lively at all. Why don’t we add one more person this year? What do you think?” ”

“Who do you want to invite to our family for the New Year?”Old Mrs. Cen asked.

“”Chenyu,”Cen Yuyan answered. ”

“”No,”old Mrs. Cen directly refused. ”

“”Why?”CEN Yuyan continued, “Chenyu is not from the capital, and she doesn’t have any relatives or friends in the capital. Now that her manager and assistant have gone back home for the holidays, she’s the only one in the capital. Anyway, our family doesn’t have many people, so wouldn’t it be more lively with her?” ”

Zhou Xiang and old Mrs. Cen were people who liked to be lively.

“They could take this opportunity to let Old Mrs. Cen see song Chenyu’s strengths, and they could also create an opportunity for song Chenyu and Cen Shaoqing to get to know each other. ”

This was simply killing two birds with one stone!

“”When I say no, I mean no!”Old Mrs. Cen looked at Cen Yuyan, “Fourth girl, it’s your right to be friends with that fish, I can’t control it! But, if you want to bring that fish back to our house for the New Year, you absolutely can’t!” ”

“”What fish? Her name is Chenyu! Song Chenyu! Chenyu is my best friend. Grandma, Why are you always targeting her?”Cen Yuyan frowned. ”

“Thinking about it carefully, song Chenyu had never offended Old Mrs. Cen. ”

But Old Mrs. Cen didn’t like song Chenyu.

“”That fish is obviously not a good fish!”Old Mrs. Cen glanced at Cen Yuyan. “You stupid thing. If you are sold one day, you can even count the money for others!” ”

“”Mom, don’t you like sunken fish the most? Help me say a few words!”Cen Yuyan pulled Zhou Xiang’s arm. ”

“Zhou Xiang said, “I respect your grandmother’s opinion on this matter. After all, sunken fish is a public figure. If she rashly stays at our house to celebrate the New Year, there will definitely be rumors.” ”

Who in the Cen family was the easiest to have rumors with song Chenyu?

“Of course, it would be Cen Shaoqing! ”

“If it was in the past, Zhou Xiang would very likely agree to song Chenyu coming to the Cen family for the New Year. However, it was different now. Cen Shaoqing now had ye Zao. ”

“If song Chenyu were to get involved, what if ye Zao misunderstood? ”

Only Ye Zao was the most suitable daughter-in-law candidate in Zhou Xiang’s heart!

No one could replace ye Zao’s position in her heart.

Song Chenyu could at most be considered a female celebrity that Zhou Xiang admired.

“Cen Yuyan frowned. “Mom, Chenyu is really pitiful spending the new year alone outside!” ” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Zhou Xiang was a soft-hearted person. She could not bear to see others beg her.

“Thinking about it, song Chenyu staying alone outside during this family reunion was indeed quite heartwarming. ”

“Thinking about this, Zhou Xiang was a little shaken and turned to look at Old Mrs. Cen. ”

Old Mrs. Cen knocked the scissors in her hand on the table. “There are a lot of poor people outside! Are you going to bring them to our house for the New Year?”

“But I’m different from Chenyu. Chenyu is my friend.”

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Don’t think that I don’t know what you’re up to! Do you think that the position of the Cen family’s granddaughter-in-law can be remembered by any Tom, Dick, or Harry? Not to mention that it’s just a fish! Does she deserve that fish?” ”

Old Mrs. Cen and Zhou Xiang were both very kind people in Cen Yuyan’s heart.

“She originally thought that after she said this, the two of them would definitely agree with her. ”

She did not expect that old Mrs. Cen seemed to have changed into a different person.

“She had become without the slightest bit of sympathy. Instead, she was still smearing song Chenyu’s name. ”

She really did not know what was so good about Ye Zhuo!

He could actually make old Mrs. Cen so blind.

Just wait.

Old Mrs. Cen would regret it when the time came if she protected ye Zao now.

“Forget it! Just pretend that I never said anything about this!”Cen Yuyan dragged her suitcase and went upstairs in a huff.

Old Mrs. Cen looked at her back and frowned. “He’s getting more and more outrageous!”
