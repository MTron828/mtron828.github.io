Translator: 549690339

Zhao Xueyin happened to pass by.

“Hearing these words, her eyes were full of sarcasm. ”

Ye Zhuo was only worthy of such a person!

A real man would disdain to bend down and do chores for a woman.

An imposter was an imposter. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“After all, he was not the real master five. ”

“A man like Cen Shaoqing, who had no manliness at all, was not worthy of calling himself master five. ”

“Although the Cen family was the number one family in China, compared to master five of DK Consortium, the gap was not small. ”

DK consortium was number one in the international rankings.

The Cen family was only the number one family in China.

These two people were incomparable!

“”Xueyin.”At this moment, Si Lui’s voice sounded from behind. ”

“Zhao Xueyin looked back slightly, “Big Brother Si.” ”

“The lawyer continued, “Why did you come to the first floor?” ”

“”I heard from your Linda that you were on the first floor, so I came,”Zhao Xueyin said. ”

“Hearing that Zhao Xueyin had come to look for him, the lawyer was a little excited. “Then let’s go up and talk?” ”

“Yes.”Zhao Xueyin nodded and followed the lawyer to the elevator.

“Before the two of them turned around, there was a discussion behind them. ”

It was probably something about how Miss Zhao and chairman Si were a good match.

Zhao Xueyin furrowed her brows without a trace.

A match?

Were they blind?

How could the lawyer be a good match for her!

The lawyer’s lips curled up slightly. His eyes were filled with joy as he looked at Zhao Xueyin from the corner of his eyes.

“It was likely that girls were more reserved, so there was no obvious change in Zhao Xueyin’s expression. ”

Ding —

The elevator door opened.

The two of them walked in.

The lawyer’s office was on the 57th floor.

“Soon, the elevator stopped on the 57th floor. ”

The lawyer pressed the elevator door with his hand.

“After Zhao Xueyin walked out of the elevator, the lawyer walked out. ”

He came to the lawyer’s office.

The lawyer personally made a cup of tea for Zhao Xueyin.

“Zhao Xueyin took a sip of tea and said, “Brother Si, I came to look for you because I want to ask you for a favor.” ”

“Go ahead.”

“Zhao Xueyin continued, “I heard that you know shallow drink, right?” ”

How would she know shallow drink.

The person who really knew shallow drink was Si lui.

“”I don’t know shallow drink, but a friend of mine has worked with him before.”Although si lui didn’t attend the board meeting, he could see what Zhao Xueyin was thinking. “You want to ask shallow drink to design our LOGO?” ”

“”Yes.”Zhao Xueyin nodded. “Brother Si, can you help me?” ”

“If Zhao Xueyin wanted to work with Qian you, she had to find a connection. ”

The lawyer was the only connection she could think of.

“Although the lawyer didn’t know Qian You, he could at least help contact Qian you. ”

“The lawyer smiled and said, “Sure.” ”

“Really?”Zhao Xueyin said excitedly.

“Of course!”Si lui nodded.

“As long as it was Zhao Xueyin who suggested it, he would not hesitate. ”

“With Si Lui’s words, Zhao Xueyin was relieved. She stood up and said, “Big Brother Si, I’ll leave it to you.” ”

“Si lui smiled and said, “It’s my pleasure.” ”

“After Zhao Xueyin left, Si lui sent a message. ”

“An hour later, Si lui appeared in a teahouse. ”

“”Brother Yu! Over Here!”When he saw the lawyer, a young man sitting by the window waved at him excitedly. ”

The young man sitting by the window looked to be about 23 or 24 years old. He had dyed yellow hair and had earrings of the same color on his ears. He looked a little sloppy.

The lawyer walked over. “Wenhao.”

“Yang Wenhao smiled and said, “Brother Yu, why are you in such a hurry to call me out? Is there something urgent?” ”

“The lawyer said, “It’s just a small matter.” ”

Yang Wenhao reached out and poured a cup of tea for the lawyer. “Go ahead.”

The lawyer did not beat around the bush and went straight to the point. “I want to ask you for a favor.”

A favor?

That was really rare!

“All his life, he had always been the one asking for the lawyer’s help. The lawyer had never asked for his help before. ”

“Yang Wenhao continued, “Brother Yu, don’t joke with me! If you can’t even solve the problem, how can I solve it?” ”

“Only you can solve this problem!”The lawyer said.

“Tell me about it.”Yang Wenhao took a sip of tea.

“The lawyer looked at Yang Wenhao and said, “I heard that you’ve worked with Qian you before, right?” ”

“En.”Yang Wenhao nodded.

“”I want you to help me introduce Qian You,”the lawyer said. ”

Introduce Qian You?

“Yang Wenhao seemed to suddenly remember something, “Did Zhao Xueyin ask you to come?” ”

Qian Zhu was a designer.

“Soon, it would be the 50th anniversary of the Shunxi Financial Group. Zhao Xueyin wanted to ask Qian Zhu to design a new LOGO, but she didn’t have any connections, so she could only find a lawyer. ”
