Chapter 88: 074: strength slaps face, stunning everyone! 2

[ yezi is so beautiful! ]

[ F * ck! Yezi is so a! ]

[ F * ck! This streamer’s face is so tough. Most people would die in front of such a high-definition camera. ]

[ I love her! She’s a fan! ]

[ F * ck! With her looks and legs, I can lick them for the rest of my life! ]

[ punch in for Leaf! ]

[ my leaf is so beautiful! ]

[ so what if she’s good-looking? Just because she’s good-looking, does that mean she’s not a cheating dog? ! I wonder what those brainless fans are so excited about! ]

[ I’m waiting for leaf to slap me in the face. ]

[ quick, PK! ]

[ it’s not certain who will slap who in the face, Cheating Dog! ]

The host on the stage looked at ye Zhuo just like that.

Her expression was blank.

She had worked for six years and had seen countless streamers and artistes, but she had never seen such a beautiful person.

Moreover, not only was she beautiful, but her temperament was also good to the point of exploding.

Even though she was a woman, when she saw this, she was filled with emotions.

[ hahaha, the host’s little sister is already intoxicated by Ye Zao’s magnificent beauty! ]

[ I’m so envious of the host, to be able to see our leaves so closely... ]

[ little sister has already been successfully bent by Yezi. ]

After a long while, the host finally recovered from ye Zao’s magnificent beauty and guided ye Zao to sign his autograph. Then, he brought ye Zao to Mu Yourong’s side, “Little Sister, let me introduce you. This is the female streamer of the year, My Rong. Do you still remember your PK with her?”

Ye Zao nodded slightly. “Of course I do.”

The host continued, “Then I wonder if I will be lucky enough to see your PK today? I see that the audience on the screen is looking forward to it.”

“I don’t have any problems.”Ye Zhuo raised his eyes slightly. I wonder if it’s convenient for Miss My Rong?”

“I don’t have any problems either.”Mu Yourong gave ye Zhuo a friendly smile.

Little B * Tch!

In a moment, she would not even know how she was going to die!

She dared to PK with her!

She really overestimated herself.

“Then this way, please.”The host made a ‘please’gesture and brought the two of them to the Go board.

The two of them sat cross-legged on the futon, and in front of them was the already arranged Go board.

After guessing the pieces, Mu Yourong was the red piece.

According to the rules of chess, the red piece went first.

Mu yourong said, “I came into contact with chess earlier, so it’s better to let Miss Sitara go first.”

It was said that it was better to strike first.

It was the same on the chess game, where the first person had the advantage.

“Thank you.”Ye Zhuo smiled slightly and said unceremoniously, “I appreciate your kindness, but I never need others to give way to me.”

[ TSK TSK TSK! What Big Words! There’s no need to give way! Is this the attitude you have when talking to a Senior? ]

[ cheating dog, what a big face! ]

[ Yezi is handsome! ]

[ Yezi, we love you! ]

[ our Yezi doesn’t need to be given way in the first place. A certain best female streamer is too good at pretending! ]! Who Didn’t know that the person who played first had an advantage? If Yezi really played first and won, she would definitely be accused by shameless people as giving way to Yezi! From this, it can be seen that a certain streamer is a shameless scheming B * Tch! ]

[ the analysis above is very correct! Our leaf doesn’t need to be given up! Scheming B * Tch is Shameless. ]

[ Rong Rong, you can do it! Crush the Cheating Dog! ] VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

[ the cheating dog dies in the family! ]

Hearing this, Mu Yourong said, “Since that’s the case, then I won’t be polite. Little Sister, if you lose, Don’t Cry and act shamelessly.”

In this battle, she wanted to make sure ye Zao cheated, so that ye Zao would never be able to turn the tables!

She was the one who could stand shoulder to shoulder with Cen Wuye.

Who Was Ye Zao?

He was just a cheating dog that could not be seen in the light.

Ye Zao slightly raised his eyes, “Similarly, I want to give it to you. If you lose, then you lose. Today’s PK is fair and just. Don’t always find those lousy excuses! “Also, if I win, I hope to hear an apology from miss MY Rong for the Cheating Incident.”

Hearing that.

The host’s expression was very interesting.

He won against Mu Yourong?

This sitara was really confident!

Did she really think that with a beautiful face, she could win against Mu Yourong in chess?

Mu Yourong was a grandmaster!

No. 1 in the entire Internet!

She was just a rookie who was suspected of cheating, how could she compare to Mu Yourong?

Mu yourong nodded, “Sure. If you lose, I hope that you can take the initiative to admit your mistake and never cheat again! As long as you behave yourself, the door of our wonderful sound will always be open for you.”

[ not only must you take the initiative to admit your mistake, you must also apologize to our Rong Rong! ]

[ Ah Ah Ah! Rong Rong is great! ]

[ Rong Rong should treat cheating dogs like this! ]
