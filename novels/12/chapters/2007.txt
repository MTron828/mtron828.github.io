“Chapter 2008: 420: Trash! Miss ye will always be there, believing in more than one thing! 4”

“In other words, you people who come from good families still can’t compare to this little orphan girl! ”

Yes.

Ye Lan was indeed an orphan.

“Back then, when ye Zhuo brought her back from the roadside, she was the same age as ye Han. ”

“From then on, she was the same as ye Han, always calling ye zhuo “Sister”. ”

“Everyone praised ye Zao for being a kind-hearted person, nurturing a homeless orphan into an indispensable talent in the Ye family base. ”

But who could see her efforts?

“Ever since the day she followed ye Zao, everyone looked at her with sympathy and pity... ”

Just like now.

“She was sitting on a chair in the Ye family base, but someone still reminded her that she was once a homeless orphan. ”

What’s wrong with an orphan?

What’s wrong with being pitiful? FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

An orphan wants to be a dwarf?

An orphan needs to accept the strange looks from others?

Wasn’t Ye Zao also a homeless orphan?

Why didn’t anyone say anything about ye Zao?

It was as if everyone had a problem with her!

She couldn’t stand it.

“She had earned everything she had, but people always subconsciously attributed all of this to Ye Zao. ”

They ignored her efforts.

“It was like, if it were not for ye Zao, she would not have gotten everything she had today? ”

All of her achievements today were given to her by Ye Zao?

It was all because of her own hard work!

Ye Zao was the most hypocritical person in the world.

Why did ye Zao adopt her back then and give her the best education? He even let her go to the Ye family’s base!

It was all because of her high talent!

“From the moment ye Zao took her in, he knew that she would definitely make a difference in the future. ”

“Ye Lan believed that if she did not have ye Zao, her life would be better. ”

“Therefore, she had to prove it to everyone. ”

“She, Ye Lan, could also hold up the sky. ”

“Dai Sheng raised his head to look at the ceiling and said loudly, “Miss Ye! Miss Ye! If there is a spirit in the sky, please open your eyes and take a look! This is your adopted good sister!” ”

His voice was sorrowful and helpless.

Ye Zao was no longer here.

The Ye clan’s base became a pile of loose sand.

“Now, Ye Lan actually still wanted to change the Ye clan’s base into the Qiu clan’s base. ”

This was simply ungrateful!

Ye Zao had only left for how long? It had only been a few months.

“So fast, and he was already gone? ”

“”Miss Ye has already left,”ye Lan said without hiding anything. “Old Fellow, look carefully. The person standing in front of you now is ye Lan! That Ye Lan you looked down on from the start!” ”

“No matter how powerful ye Zhuo was, it was only in the past! ”

“Men!”Ye Lan said.

“”Here.”Immediately, a guard team came forward. ”

“When Ye Zhuo was still here, he trusted ye Lan very much and handed over all the matters of the base to Ye Lan to manage. ”

Ye Lan also took this opportunity to cultivate her own power in the Ye family base.

“Tear down that plaque on it!”Autumn flute pointed at the plaque hanging in the middle of the hall and said.

“Yes!”

“Let’s see who dares to touch it!”Dai Sheng stood in the middle of the road. “Whoever dares to touch it will step over my corpse today!”

“Even if he had to die, he had to protect ye Zao. ”

Although ye Zao was no longer there.

The faith in his heart was still there.

“No matter when, he would never forget that there was an era called ‘Miss Ye!’ ”

“Old Man! Do you really want to go against me?”Ye Lan looked at Dai Sheng. “Do you really think I won’t dare to Touch You!”

“Dai Sheng stood where he was, his face full of determination. ”

Ye Lan directly picked up a gun and aimed it at Dai Sheng’s temple.

“Dai Sheng closed his eyes and shouted, “Everyone has to die. Some are heavier than Mount Tai, and some are lighter than a feather. Using it will lead to a different outcome! Miss Ye, I, Old Dai, have come to look for you today!” ”

Bang!

Ye Lan pulled the trigger.

A shockwave passed.

Dai Sheng fell to the ground.

This shot hit old Dai’s left chest.

Blood instantly spread to the entire ground.

“Ye Lan blew on the muzzle of the gun, walked to Old Dai’s side, and kicked him, “Just one millimeter more. If I move another millimeter to the right, your dog life will be gone! “I want you to keep this dog life and watch how I hang this plaque! “And how did Miss Qiu get that position!” ”

“Although Old Dai had lost a lot of blood, his consciousness was still very clear. He clenched his fists tightly. “Ye Lan! You’re not human! You Don’t deserve to have the surname Ye! Miss Ye will not let you off!” ”

“Do you think I want to have the surname Ye?”Ye Lan looked up at the sky and laughed.
