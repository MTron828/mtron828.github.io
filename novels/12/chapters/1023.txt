“Chapter 1024: 229: Aunt Lang finally knows the truth of the past, tears in her eyes! 5”

Translator: 549690339

“Xi Weiyue frowned slightly, subconsciously feeling that this lawyer was not easy to get along with. ”

“She graduated from a prestigious university, had a lot of work experience, and had even founded her own company. Logically speaking, the lawyer should not be so cold. ”

What XI Weiyue did not know was that talent was everywhere in the financial world.

People like her were even more powerful!

Aunt Lang had pushed Xi Weiyue to become grandfather Ye’s successor. The lawyer had thought that she was such an outstanding person!

So it turned out!

She was just so-so.

“At this moment, the lawyer’s phone vibrated. ”

“The lawyer looked up at Xi Muwen. “I’m sorry, I’ll reply to a message first.” ”

“Xi Muwen quickly nodded. “Chairman Si, please do as you please.” ”

The lawyer turned around and started to reply. [ I’ve seen her. Her aptitude is average. ]

“After replying to the message, the lawyer turned around again and continued, “Where’s Aunt Lang?” ”

“”She’s inside.”Xi Muwen made a ‘please’gesture. “Chairman Si, please follow me.” ”

“Okay.”The lawyer followed Xi Muwen’s footsteps.

They came to the hall.

Si lui walked directly to Aunt Lang’s side. “Aunt Lang.”

“He was obviously addressing her respectfully, but a mocking look flashed across his eyes. ”

“Ye Langhua was famous when she was young, but now? ”

She was still trash!

This kind of person was not worthy of respect at all.

“If ye Langhua was not grandfather Ye’s daughter, Si lui would not have come here. ”

“No matter what, grandfather Ye was the founder of the Shunxi Financial Group. ”

“Aunt Lang stood up and said, “Si Lu, let me introduce you. This is my biological daughter, Xiao Banyue.” ”

“Si Lu turned to look at Jiang Yan and frowned. Then, he reached out to Jiang Yan and said, “Hello, Miss banyue, I’m Si Lu!” ”

“Jiang Yan was born in a normal family and had only interacted with the Xi family recently. When she saw a business elite like Si Lu, she could not help but feel nervous. “Mr. Si, Mr. Si...” ”

Is this really ye Langhua’s biological daughter?

“Even though Si Lu did not know what ye Langhua was like when she was young, he knew that the daughter of a talented woman who was famous throughout the capital should not look like this. ”

Even Xi Mu Wensheng’s daughter was more generous than Jiang Yan.

“However, Si Lu did not say much. He just needed to do his job well. “Aunt Lang, please give me the recommendation letter.” ”

“This is the letter of recommendation.”Ye Langhua handed the lawyer an envelope.

“The lawyer took the envelope and turned to look at Xi Weiyue. “Miss XI, if you’re ready, then let’s go.” ”

“In a place like the Xi family, the lawyer could not stay for even a second. ”

“So Soon?”Yang Jiao did not expect the lawyer to leave without even drinking his saliva.

Xi Muwen looked at Yang Jiao unhappily.

What a woman’s opinion!

Xi Weiyue was going to do something important!

Yang Jiao immediately shut up when she received XI Muwen’s gaze.

“Xi muwen smiled and said, “It’s neither fast nor fast. They are insensible women! Chairman si, Weiyue is already prepared. You can just take her away.” ”

“Lawyer si stood up and looked at Aunt Lang. “Aunt Lang, then we’ll be leaving first. If there are any problems, please send me a message.” ”

“”Okay.”Aunty Lang stood up to send them off. “It’s Weiyue’s first time in the financial world. If she does anything wrong, please bear with her.” ”

“”Don’t worry, it’s what we should do.”The lawyer nodded. ”

The few of them walked to the door

“Yang Jiao was very reluctant to part with XI Weiyue. She held Xi Weiyue’s hand and said, “Weiyue, you must come back to visit mom more often when you have time.” ”

“Xi muwen frowned and said, “Alright, Alright! Why are you crying like that! Weiyue is going to do something big!” ”

Yang Jiao sniffed.

“Xi Weiyue smiled and comforted her, “Mom, don’t worry, I’ll definitely come back to visit you often.” ”

“”MMM, you must remember to come back often.” ”

“Xi Weiyue then turned to look at Aunt Lang and Jiang Yan. “Aunty, Sister Banyue, I’ll be leaving first then. You guys stay at home and be well.” ”

“Go.”Auntie Lang nodded.

“After greeting everyone, xi Weiyue got into the car. ” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“As they watched the car leave, Xi Muwen and Yang Jiao’s eyes were filled with hope. ”

They believed that Xi Weiyue would definitely lead the XI family to a new peak!

“On this side, elder Zhang brought Cao Wei to the Lin family. ”

Ye Shu had just found out about her background and was still in a daze.

“Seeing ye Shu, elder Zhang sighed, “They look alike! They really look alike! They are exactly the same as Lang Hua when she was young!” ”

Ye Shu was stunned for a moment.

“Ye Zhuo took the initiative to introduce, “Mom, this is elder Zhang.” ”
