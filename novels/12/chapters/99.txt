Chapter 100: 075: Heal and save, Brother and sister meet

Aunt Zhang continued, “So, your only hope now is the old woman. While the old woman is still in charge, quickly marry into the Lin family. You and Jin Cheng are still young, so give birth to a fat boy as soon as possible. When Xianxian marries into the CEN family, you and Jin Cheng’s son Will Inherit the Lin family’s great cause. When that time comes, you will be the most honorable woman in the entire capital! “As for Lin Ze, let him stay where he is!”

Hearing this, Feng Qianhua nodded. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Aunt Zhang was right.

Lin Ze was no longer reliable. Now, she could only rely on Old Lady Lin’s love for her to quickly marry into the Lin family. The most important thing was to give birth to a child that belonged to her and Lin Jin Cheng as soon as possible.

After chatting with Aunt Zhang for a long while, Feng Qianhua saw that Old Lady Lin was about to wake up. Only then did she return to the front hall.

As soon as she entered, she heard Old Mrs. Lin earnestly advise Lin ze, “AH ZE, look, your aunt Feng came to see me again today with the health soup. With my body, if it weren’t for her, I would have died long ago!”

Lin Ze didn’t say a word.

“What’s wrong with your Aunt Feng marrying your father? Why Can’t you be more sensible? If you were half as sensible as Xianxian, our family wouldn’t be in such a mess!”

In Old Lady Feng’s eyes, Feng Xianxian was much more sensible than Lin Ze.

At least Feng Xianxian never stopped Feng Qianhua from marrying into the Lin family, unlike Lin Ze!

Feng Qianhua was a good woman. If she could marry into the Lin family, the Lin family would definitely be happier than now.

How was the Lin family like a family now?

It was clearly a cold house!

This was all ye Shu’s fault!

The reason why Lin Ze was so insensible was because he had followed ye Shu’s personality.

If Ye Shu was a good woman, she wouldn’t have seduced Lin Jin city to have a child out of wedlock back then!

When she thought of this, Old Lady Lin’s heart ached with anger.

Their Lin family was originally a harmonious family with a loving mother and a filial son.

Ye Shu was a slut!

Lin Ze didn’t respond to Old Lady Lin’s words and only said, “Grandma, I also invited my classmates to have supper together. I Won’t Disturb Your Rest.”

After saying that, Lin Ze turned around and left.

Just then, he bumped into Feng Qianhua outside.

“Aunty Feng,”Lin Ze greeted her indifferently.

Feng Qianhua was still the same as before. She said with a smile, “Where is Ah Ze going? Aunty made your favorite Hibiscus cake. It’s still warm now. Do you want to eat some?”

Lin Ze did not answer her and left without looking back.

Aunt Zhang followed behind and said, “Young master has been in a bad mood these few days. Don’t mind it, Miss Qianhua. In fact, young master still cares about you a lot.”

Feng Qianhua smiled and said, “I know. Ah Ze is like his father. He is cold on the outside but warm on the inside! By the way, Aunt Zhang, remember to keep the Hibiscus cake for Ah Ze.”

These words made old Mrs. Lin feel very uncomfortable.

If Lin Ze was really cold on the outside but warm on the inside, it would be fine.

But Lin ze just did not like Feng Qianhua, and even said crazy things.

It was really a waste that Feng Qianhua still liked him so much! Everything good was always the first thing to cling to Lin Ze.

Could he let Feng Qianhua Down?

Old Mrs. Lin Sighed.

Feng Qianhua walked in with a smile. “Aunt Lin, why are you sighing?”

There was a hint of worry in Old Lady Lin’s eyes. “I’m worried that Ah Ze is becoming more and more insensible and will go astray in the future.”

After all, she had ye Shu’s roots.

Coupled with her words and actions today, Old Lady Lin was really very worried.

Feng Qianhua smiled and comforted her. “Aunt Lin, ah Ze is a very sensible child, but he’s not good at expressing himself. You Don’t have to worry.”

Aunt Zhang continued, “Old Madam, isn’t it very easy to make the young master become more sensible? You Don’t have to worry at all!”

“What do you mean?”Old Madam Lin raised her head to look at Aunt Zhang.

Aunt Zhang continued, “As the saying goes, when in danger, think of peace! The young master is the only child in the family now. He is spoiled and pampered. It is normal for the young master to be a little insensible! If Miss Qianhua could give the young master a younger brother, the young master would become an older brother. With a sense of threat, he would naturally become more sensible! Tell me, isn’t this killing two birds with one stone?”

Old Madam Lin’s eyes lit up.

Feng Qianhua said a little embarrassedly, “Aunt Zhang, what are you talking about! Aunt Lin, don’t listen to her nonsense.”

Old Mrs. Lin smiled and said, “I think aunt Zhang is quite right. Qianhua, how great would it be if you could give birth to a child for our Jin City!”

Feng Qianhua and the child of Lin Jin city would definitely be very smart!

The more old Mrs. Lin thought about it, the more excited she became.

...

Night Market.

Lin Ze, Li Wen, dog er, and fat tiger were sitting at a small round table eating Guan Dong’s cooking.

It was an extremely cold winter night.

After taking a mouthful of Guan Dong’s cooking, which was covered in red oil, Lin Ze felt as if all the pores on his body had opened up. It was extremely warm.

“Brother ZE, dog er, and fat tiger, come and have a drink with us.”Li Wen picked up the Beaker on the table.

Lin Ze followed suit and raised the cup together. He drank the Beaker in one gulp.

When the foul alcohol entered his throat, he choked on it.

“Brother Ze, are you in a bad mood?”

Lin Ze didn’t say anything.

Li Wen continued, “We haven’t found out about the candy wrappers yet. Do you think your grandmother will really let your father marry that woman and give you a younger sister?”

“It’s very likely.”Lin Ze held the soju wine glass.

Old Mrs. Lin liked Feng Qianhua very much. According to the current situation, it was only a matter of time before Feng Qianhua married her.

Dog Two didn’t know how to comfort her, so it could only say, “Actually, having a little sister is quite good.”

“I don’t like Little Sisters.”

“Don’t be too full of yourself,”dog two continued, “What if one day brother Ze becomes a sis-con?”

“You’re thinking too much.”Lin Ze kicked the stool away. “I’m going to the bathroom.”

Looking at Lin Ze’s back, Li Wen patted dog two. “Brother Ze hates little girls the most! Especially girls who dream of being his little sister!”

Because of Feng Xianxian, Lin Ze had never liked the word ‘little sister’since he was young. In fact, he didn’t even like to interact with little girls in school. He didn’t even like to interact with little girls.

Dog Two scratched its head. “Then I’ll be more careful when I speak next time.”

There was a public bathroom at the night market.

Lin Ze came out after washing his hands and accidentally bumped into someone. He subconsciously wanted to help that person up, but he didn’t expect that that person was also a martial artist. He was actually one step ahead of him and held his hand. “Are You Alright?”

It was a very pleasant voice.

Lin Ze looked up and saw a face with picturesque features.
