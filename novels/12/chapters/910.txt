“Don’t think that Tian Tian is called Tian Tian, Tian Tian is actually a little boy who lives up to his name. ”

The reason why he is called Tian Tian is because Tian Tian has an older brother above her.

“When she was pregnant with Tian Tian, Cen Yueya liked to eat sweet things throughout her pregnancy. In addition, she wanted a girl, so she felt that the child in her stomach was definitely a girl. ”

“Who knew that after she gave birth, she would be pregnant with a girl. ”

“She couldn’t give birth to a girl as she wished, so Cen Yueya gave Tian Tian a nickname of a girl. ”

Tian Tian’s big name was Zou Junwen.

Her brother Zou Junxi was currently studying abroad.

“”Let go of your little aunt,”Cen Shaoqing said in a deep voice. ”

Tian Tian quickly let go of Ye Zao.

Ye Zao reached out and patted Cen Shaoqing. “Why are you scaring the child?”

“Tian Tian looked up at ye Zao, her eyes filled with admiration. ”

Little Aunt was really amazing!

She actually dared to hit her uncle!

One had to know that even his mother did not dare to hit his uncle.

“Moreover, he had heard his parents’conversation behind his back. ”

“Actually, his father was also quite afraid of his uncle. ”

“The last time when the Zou family’s company had problems, his father did not dare to tell his uncle directly. He even played rock-paper-scissors with his mother. Whoever lost would be the one to tell. ”

“He did not expect that even though his little aunt looked thinner than his uncle, shorter than his uncle, and not as strong as his uncle, she was so amazing! ”

“Seeing Tian Tian like this, Ye Zhuo thought that he was frightened by Cen Shaoqing. He quickly bent down to comfort Tian Tian. “Tian Tian, your uncle was just joking with you!” ”

“After saying that, Ye Zhuo looked at Cen Shaoqing. “Quickly give Tian Tian a smile.” ”

A Smile?

Cen Shaoqing raised his eyebrows without a trace.

Why did he feel that there was something wrong with these words?

“Although he felt that there was something wrong, Cen Shaoqing still forced out a smile. ”

He rarely smiled.

“At this moment, when he smiled, the ice and snow melted and everything in the world revived. ”

“Tian Tian worshipped ye Zhuo even more. She turned to look at Ye Zhuo. “Little aunt, you’re really amazing!” ”

“That’s true.”Ye Zao raised his chin slightly. “How can your little aunt not be amazing?”

Ye Zao held Tian Tian’s hand. “Let’s go. Let’s ignore your little uncle and go over there to play.”

“Sensing Cen Shaoqing’s death stare, Tian Tian immediately broke free from ye Zao’s hand. “Little aunt, I still have other things to do!”After saying that, she ran away in a flash. ”

Ye Zao turned to look at Cen Shaoqing. “Look at how scared you are of the child.”

Cen Shaoqing took a step forward and held ye Zao’s hand with the hand holding the Buddha beads. “It’s because he’s too timid.”

“Do you like children?”Ye Zao turned to look at Cen Shaoqing.

“You want to give birth to my child?”Cen Shaoqing lowered his eyes slightly.

Ye Zao slapped Cen Shaoqing’s face.

PA —

“A middle-aged man in a suit walked over with a goblet in his hand. When he saw this scene, he was stunned. ”

What did he just see?

Cen Wuye was slapped?

The person who hit him was a little girl.

“What was most unexpected was that the aloof and unsmiling Cen Wuye did not get angry. Instead, he leaned over to the other side of his face. In the end, he gently held the girl’s hand and asked with a smile, “Does it hurt?” ”

Does it hurt?

The middle-aged man felt that he was blind. He rubbed his eyes hard and placed the wine glass back on the table before walking towards the exit. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Director Zhang! The banquet has just started! Where are you going?”

“”Director Wang!”Director Zhang nodded at him and continued, “There might be something wrong with my eyes. I plan to go to the hospital to see the ophthalmology department.” ”

CEO Wang was stunned. “Are You Alright?”

CEO Zhang gulped. “It might be quite serious.”

“CEO Wang continued, “Then the results are out. Remember to inform me on wechat that you’re safe.” ”

“Alright.”CEO Zhang nodded.

CEO Zhang walked out of the Zou family’s banquet hall.

On the other side.

“After song Chenyu returned, her expression did not look good. ”

She had been chased out by Cen Yuyan. It would be weird if her expression looked good.

Cen Yuyan was the only stepping stone that she could use to get to the CEN family.

“If she lost Cen Yuyan’s help, she might not even have the chance to get close to Cen Shaoqing, let alone marry him. ”

“Song Chenyu called Cen Yuyan and tried to explain the matter clearly, but there was a busy tone on the other end of the phone. ”

This meant that she was blacklisted.

“Song Chenyu frowned slightly, then opened wechat and edited almost a thousand words of apology to Cen Yuyan. However, the phone screen showed a system notification message that was rejected by the other party. ”

Song Chenyu opened Weibo again.

There was no Cen Yuyan among the 90 million-plus fans.

“In addition, there was no Cen Yuyan’s account in the fan group. ”
