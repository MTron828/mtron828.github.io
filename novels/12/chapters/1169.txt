“Sure.”

“At this moment, the waiter brought in two more guests.”

A man and a woman.

The man was wearing a long robe with a string of Buddhist beads in his hand.

The woman was wearing a beige coat and a pair of black Martin boots. She looked very imposing. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Yang Wenhao asked curiously, “Brother Yu, this is president ye who just came from your consortium, right?””

Si lui looked up.

Ye Zhuo?

Why did ye Zhuo come?

And he came to the same teahouse as him.

Was it really like what Zhao Xueyin said...

That Ye Zhuo was a sea king?

“It’s her.”Si lui nodded.

Yang Wenhao clicked his tongue. “She’s really pretty. I heard that she’s also pretty. Even Zhao Xueyin was defeated by her.”

Although ye Zhuo had only returned to the Shunxi Consortium for a month.

“However, the rumors about her had already spread to several financial groups.”

“”The more beautiful something is, the more deadly it is.”Si lui took a sip of tea and said, “If it weren’t for men, Ye Zhuo wouldn’t be where she is today.””

Ye Zhuo’s Perfect Plan C wasn’t created by Ye Zhuo himself at all.

“She had Cen Shaoqing as her backer, so why would she do it herself?”

Ye Zhuo and Zhao Xueyin were different.

Zhao Xueyin had gotten to where she was today by relying on her own strength.

“Previously, Ye Zhuo had wanted to use the elevator incident to rope him in.”

“Fortunately, he had seen ye Zhuo’s true colors in time, so he did not make a huge mistake.”

“Otherwise, if he hurt Zhao Xueyin because of this, he would never forgive himself for the rest of his life.”

“After the elevator incident, Ye Zhuo did not give up on continuing to rope him in.”

The meeting at the Teahouse Today was definitely not a coincidence.

“Thinking of this, Si Lui’s eyes were filled with disgust.”

“Thinking of how Zhao Xueyin was actually being suppressed by such a person, Si Lui’s heart felt even more uncomfortable.”

“Yang Wenhao raised his head to look at ye Zao who was sitting in front and said in disbelief, “Relying on a man to get to the top? Are you sure?””

He did not see ye Zao as the kind of person who relied on a man to get to the top.

Although she was a little young.

Her aura was not small at all.

“In the crowd, she stood out like a phoenix among a flock of chickens.”

She had a very pure beauty about her.

This kind of beauty was something that ordinary people did not have.

It was brought out from her bones and could not be replicated by others.

“Si lu frowned, “Why do you prefer to believe that ye Zhuo is not that kind of person than to believe Xue Yin?””

Could it be that Zhao Xueyin was worse than ye Zao?

“Yang Wenhao wasn’t afraid of Si Lu’s anger and said directly, “It’s obvious that President Ye and Zhao Xueyin aren’t the same type of person. They can’t be compared! Brother Yu, do you have some misunderstanding about President Ye?””

“Do you know ye Zao? is that what you’re saying?”Si Lu asked back.

Yang Wenhao scratched his head. “I just feel that she doesn’t seem like the type of person who relies on men to get to the top.”

“”You’re too young.”Young, inexperienced, and inexperienced. That was why he couldn’t see through people’s hearts.”

“If Yang Wenhao was in his shoes, he would have been deceived by ye Zao long ago.”

“”No, brother Yu.”Yang Wenhao continued, “I don’t think ye Zao is that kind of person.””

The lawyer couldn’t be bothered to say anything more to an idiot like Yang Wenhao.

This kind of person deserved to be deceived!

“Lawyer si stood up and said, “I’ll have to trouble you with the matter of Qian Zhuo. I still have something to do, so I’ll be leaving first.””

“Yang Wenhao nodded. “Leave it to me. Based on my relationship with Rebecca, it shouldn’t be anything difficult.””

“”Okay.”Lawyer si continued, “Remember to call me if you have any news.””

“Okay.”

“Looking at lawyer Si’s back view, Yang Wenhao’s eyes were filled with worry.”

The lawyer liked Zhao Xueyin too much.

“As the saying goes, the greater the hope, the greater the disappointment.”

Yang Wenhao was worried that one day the lawyer would see Zhao Xueyin’s true colors and would not be able to accept reality.

“Thinking of this, Yang Wenhao laughed at himself.”

“Zhao Xueyin’s acting was so good, whether the lawyer could see the truth or not was still a question.”

On the other side of the teahouse.

“Cen Shaoqing and Ye Zhuo had just left the private seat of the teahouse when Old Master Jin stood up from his chair. “Fifth master, Miss Ye.””

“Old Master Jin.”Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads and nodded slightly.

Ye Zhuo also greeted them from behind.

“Old Master Jin continued, “Fifth Master, Miss Ye, please take a seat.””

The two of them sat down opposite Old Master Jin.

“Old Master Jin had someone serve tea before he slowly said, “Fifth master, Miss Ye, I’ve invited the two of you here today because I have something to ask of you.””

“Please speak.”Cen Shaoqing opened his thin lips.

Old Master Jin sighed. “I’m not afraid that you two will laugh at me! It’s all my fault for raising such a disappointing son...”
