“”I don’t mind,”ye Han said. ”

The pregnant woman poured a glass of water for ye Han.

“Ye Han politely took a small sip and went straight to the point. “Ms. Zheng, Sun Xiaowen is your lover, right?” ”

“”What did you say?”The pregnant woman was stunned. After a moment, she continued, “I don’t know him.” ”

“Ye Han smiled and said, “Ms. Zheng, don’t be nervous. I don’t mean any harm. “I just wanted to tell you that if Sun Xiaowen makes mistakes again and again, you and your unborn child won’t have a good ending.” ” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“What do you mean?”The pregnant woman stood up.

“Do you think Sun Xiaowen’s original wife will let you off?”

“Hearing this, the pregnant woman’s emotions were a little intense. She widened her eyes and said, “I’m not a mistress!” ”

She was the most disgusting mistress in her life.

“The funny thing was that in the end, she was actually forced to become a mistress. ”

She and Sun Xiaowen were truly in love. It was Zhao meiting who interfered.

“Ye Han continued, “As long as you listen to me, I can fulfill your miserable fate as a couple. If Sun Xiaowen is wrong again, the two of you will become a desperate couple.” ”

“The pregnant woman looked at Ye Han. “You, you can really help me?” ”

Ye Han nodded.

“What right do you have to make me believe you?”The pregnant woman asked back.

“Ye Han smiled and said, “Do you think that other than believing me now, there is a second path that can be taken? I can at least give you a guarantee.” ”

“Speaking up to this point, ye Han paused and continued, “Even if you don’t think for yourself, you should think for the child in your stomach.” ”

“No matter what, a child was a mother’s greatest weakness. ”

“As expected, when she heard this, the pregnant woman’s expression changed. After a moment, she raised her head and looked at Ye Han. “What do you want me to do?” ”

“Ye Han continued, “You’re Sun Xiaowen’s favorite woman. I know that you definitely have a way to contact Sun Xiaowen.” ”

The pregnant woman did not deny it.

“She indeed had a way to contact Sun Xiaowen, but was this person in front of her really worth trusting? ”

“Ye Han looked at the pregnant woman and continued, “Don’t worry, I will never go back on my words. As long as you can convince Sun Xiaowen, I have a way to fulfill your wish.” ”

The pregnant woman hesitated for a moment. “What right do you have to make me trust you?”

“I’ll give you one day to think about it.”Ye Han stood up from his chair. “This is my contact information.”

“After saying that, he left his contact information behind and turned around to leave. ”

The pregnant woman looked at Ye Han’s back and frowned slightly as she fell into deep thought.

In the small dark room.

Man Wen suddenly felt that something was wrong.

“In the darkness, he felt gusts of chilly wind accompanied by a slight hissing sound. ”

Was there a snake?

“Realizing this problem, man Wen immediately stood up from the ground and prepared to defend against the enemy. ”

Hiss!

“At this moment, an ice-cold snake wrapped around man Wen’s neck. ”

“In the next second, Man Wen’s hand accurately grabbed the snake’s seven inches and fiercely pulled it down. ”

The fierce pheasant’s neck instantly broke into two pieces.

The air immediately filled with the smell of blood.

“Man Wen could not see what the snake looked like, but he could smell that it was different from ordinary snakes. ”

“In addition to the stench of blood, there was also a smell that ordinary snakes did not have. ”

It was a little pungent.

It was something he had never smelled before.

It seemed that things were not as simple as he thought.

“Man Xing had not only attacked man Jiangshan and Zhao Dan, but also had the intention to kill him. ”

Man Wen stood in the darkness.

A memory from many years ago appeared in his mind.

“At that time, man Xing was also a sensible and kind daughter. ”

It was unknown when man Xing had become like this.

...

On the other side.

“After fan mu found out about man Wen’s matter, he was so anxious that he went around looking for connections. ”

“However, man Wen had offended the public. ”

Who would be willing to get into trouble in this kind of situation?

“At this moment, Wen Yang looked at fan mu. “Why don’t we go and look for Miss Manxing?” ”

“Manxing?”Fan Mu looked at Wen Yang.

“Wen Yang nodded. “Yes, no matter what, Miss Manxing is Manwen’s elder sister. I believe that she will definitely not sit idly by.” ”

“Although Manxing and Manwen had fought for the presidency, they were siblings after all. ”

“Fan Mu shook his head. “If man Xing would save man Wen, he wouldn’t have waited for us to speak.” ”

“Moreover, he suspected that man Xing had something to do with this. ”

“”Let’s give it a try. What if it works?”Wen Yang continued, “It’s better to give it a try than to wait for Death!” ”

“”It’s useless.”Fan Mu looked at Wen Yang. “They are blood-related siblings. From a blood-related point of view, their relationship is closer than ours. Going to man Xing at this time is not only unnecessary, it’s also asking for trouble.” ”
