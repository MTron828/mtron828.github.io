Director Ma was nowhere to be seen.

Where was director Ma?

Where did he go?

He was clearly behind her just now.

“At this moment, professor Feng suddenly saw something on the ground. ”

Professor Feng squatted down and picked it up. It was an amulet.

This amulet was given to her by his wife before director Ma boarded the spaceship to protect her.

“Under normal circumstances, the amulet was kept close to the body. ”

Could it be...

Could it be that something happened to director Ma?

Professor Feng gulped and pressed the communicator beside his ear. “Director Ma! Can you hear me? Director Ma?”

There was no response from the communicator.

Professor Feng connected to the staff in the spaceship again. “Tom! Is Tom There?”

“”Yes, Professor Feng.”Tom’s voice came through the communication device. ”

“Professor Feng Sighed in relief and continued, “Is director MA in the cabin?” ”

“”Professor Feng, director Ma is not in the cabin.” ” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“What about the C Cabin? Is there director MA in the C Cabin?”Professor Feng asked.

“”Wait a moment,”Tom continued, “I’m here to help you connect to the manager of C section.” ”

“Soon, the voice of the person in charge of Area C was heard. “Hello, Professor Feng.” ”

“Professor Feng said directly, “Is director Ma Here?” ”

“Director Ma is not here.”

Not here too?

“If director Ma was not in the spaceship, where was he now? ”

Could it be that there was really some hidden danger on Europa?

“Otherwise, why would director Ma disappear for no reason? ”

“If it were any other time, professor Feng would definitely not be in a hurry. ”

But this was an alien planet!

An alien planet where anything could happen.

What should they do now?

“At the same time, the bullet screen was abuzz with discussion. ”

[ there seems to be one person missing. ]

“[ the camera flashed just now, and then that person disappeared. ] ”

[ could he have been hijacked by aliens? ]

“[ Europa has such a beautiful scenery, it’s practically a small earth. I think the environment is pretty good, there shouldn’t be any high-level life forms. ] If there really were high-level life forms, the ecology wouldn’t be so well protected, take Earth for example. Currently on Earth, where else could one find an ecological environment like Europa! ”

“[ Dr. YC said that Europa is full of danger, it’s not a habitable planet. What You’re seeing now is only a superficial phenomenon. The sudden disappearance of a person is a sign, and also a warning! ] ”

“[ I am laughing. It is already so late, and you are still thinking of clearing YC’s name! If Europa is really like what YC said, will the spaceship still be able to land successfully? ] ”

[ don’t be ridiculous. I also feel that the sudden disappearance of a person is somewhat abnormal. ]

[ YC dog is really disgusting! The scientific and technological world has turned into a rice bowl. ]

“”Professor Feng.”At this moment, director Ma’s voice suddenly came from the communication device. ”

Professor Feng turned around and saw director Ma standing behind her.

“Seeing director Ma, Professor Feng heaved a sigh of relief. He pressed the communicator and spoke to him, “Director Ma, where did you go just now?” ”

“Director ma waved the sample in his hand and said with a smile, “I went to collect samples! I found that this plant is similar to our Ganoderma! But at the same time, it seems to be a single-celled organism.” ”

“You suddenly disappeared. I thought something happened to you!”

“Director ma said, “How could it be! ?”! I have just seen it. Europa is completely a quiet and peaceful planet. Moreover, the ecological resources can complement with the earth. It is not as terrifying as YC said! Don’t be influenced by her.” ”

“Yes.”Professor Feng nodded.

[ hahaha! Those people who said that director Ma had an accident were slapped in the face. ]

[ why did those people stop talking? did their faces hurt? ]

“[ Europa is rich in resources. In the future, these resources will be ours. YC will definitely regret it. ] ”

“[ regret is necessary. After all, some people are still busy developing Mars! ] ”

Mars was a barren land. Everything had to start all over again.

But Europa was different.

The resources on Europa were so good that it was completely suitable for human habitation. There was no need to waste manpower and resources to re-develop it.

[ I’m dying of laughter. I just went to look at the data from China. Are they busy developing it? ]

“[ don’t say anymore. Seeing how good the resources on Europa are, maybe YC is already secretly planning how to take over Europa’s resources. ] ”

“[ Europa is not dangerous to begin with. All of this was fabricated by YC. The purpose of her doing this is to show how powerful she is! ]! Unfortunately, she underestimated the strength of our C Nation! She really thought that we C Nation people are Fools! ] ”
