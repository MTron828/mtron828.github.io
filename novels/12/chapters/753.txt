“In the past, master Yu would always participate in the question setting of the assessment competition. However, today, because ye Zhuo was also participating in the competition, master Yu did not participate in the question setting. ”

“At this moment, master Yu was practicing writing in the study room. ”

There were two sets of words hanging on the wall of the study room.

“Concealing one’s skill was not enough. Using obscurity to make it clear, concealing one’s purity to make it clear. ”

“After writing a line of words, master Yu felt that something was amiss no matter how he looked at it. In the end, he crumpled the words into a ball and threw them into the trash can. Then, he spread a new piece of rice paper and continued writing. ”

“He wrote more than ten pieces in a row, but Master Yu was still not satisfied. ”

“The words were clearly still the same, but he felt that something was missing. ”

Master Yu frowned.

Dong Dong —

“At this moment, there was a knock on the door. ”

“”Come in,”master Yu said without raising his head. ”

Han Zhen pushed the door open and walked in. “Elder Yu.”

“Little Han is here.”Master Yu put down the brush and looked up at Han Zhen.

“Han Zhen nodded. His gaze fell on the words Master Yu had written. He sighed and said, “Elder Yu, this thin golden body of yours is becoming more and more out of reach!” ”

Master Yu shook his head. “I’m Old! It’s the young people’s World Now!”

“Han Zhen smiled and said, “You’re too humble.” ”

“Not only was master Yu talented, he was also the best calligrapher in the entire literary world! ”

There was once someone who offered five figures to buy a single word of his.

He had achieved the true meaning of a thousand gold coins for a single word!

There was no other person in the entire literary world who could match up to Master Yu.

“Master Yu pointed at the two sets of words hanging on the wall and said, “Look over there. How are the words compared?” ”

Han Zhen raised his head and looked over.

He saw two amazing words.

It was a very standard thin golden body.

It was majestic!

The strokes were swift and forceful. Every stroke and stroke was so precise that not a single mistake could be found!

“Compared to these two sets of words, master Yu’s words were indeed lacking a lot of things. ”

“Han Zhen was stunned for a moment before he continued, “Elder Yu, which master’s calligraphy is this?” ”

“Seeing the shock in Han Zhen’s eyes, a smile appeared on the corner of Master Yu’s mouth. He said humbly, “This is the calligraphy of my good-for-nothing disciple.” ”

Disciple?

“It’s Shaoqing?”Han Zhen’s first reaction was Cen Shaoqing.

Cen Shaoqing was indeed a talented person.

It was a pity.

His ambition was not in the literary world.

“If Cen Shaoqing was in the literary world, he would definitely lead the literary world to a new peak. ”

Master Yu shook his head. “It’s not him.”

It’s not him?

“If it’s not him, who else could it be? ”

Master Yu only took in two disciples in total.

One was Cen Shaoqing.

And the other...

Could it be...

It’s Ye Zhuo?

“When he thought of this, Han Zhen’s eyes were filled with disbelief. ”

Ye Zhuo was still so young. Could she really write such a character? L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

This seemed a little impossible.

Even master Yu could not write such a character.

Ye Zhuo could?

“Han Zhen hesitated for a moment before continuing, “It’s... Miss Ye?” ”

Master Yu’s eyes were filled with satisfaction. “It’s her.”

It was ye Zhuo?

It was really ye Zhuo!

“Upon hearing this, Han Zhen’s eyes were filled with astonishment. “You, you’re not joking with me, right?” ”

“Master Yu smiled and said, “What’s there to joke about? Not only was this calligraphy written with a burning flame, but she also used the left and right strokes!” ”

Left and right strokes?

“This time, Han Zhen was even more surprised. ”

“These two characters were exactly the same, and there was no difference at all. ”

“If Master Yu did not say it, almost no one would believe that this was written by the left and right hands at the same time. ”

“Han Zhen continued, “Elder Yu, did you personally see Miss Ye write it?” ”

“”That’s not true.”Master Yu shook his head. “This character was given to me by someone else. After asking around many times, I found out that these two characters were written by Searing Flames!” ”

“Hearing this, Han Zhen understood. ”

“”So, you accepted Miss Ye as your disciple because of these two characters?” ”

“You can say that.”Master Yu nodded.

“Han Zhen continued to ask, “Then, have you ever thought that perhaps the person who wrote these two words wasn’t miss ye at all?” ”

“After all, master Yu hadn’t personally seen ye Zhuo write them. ”

Hearing was believing.

Seeing was believing.

“”That’s impossible!”Master Yu continued, “This is what Zhuo Zhuo wrote!” ”

“Han Zhen said, “Elder Yu, I met Miss ye today. To be honest, there’s a gap between Miss Ye and what I imagined.”Saying that there was a gap was giving master Yu Face. ”

“After meeting ye Zhuo, Han Zhen’s heart turned cold. ”

She really could not understand why master Yu would accept such a rich young lady as his disciple.

Master Yu was a little unhappy to hear this.

“In his opinion, Ye Zhuo was a very outstanding person! ”

No one in the entire literary world could compare to her.
