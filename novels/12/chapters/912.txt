“En.”Cen Yuyan nodded. “Yes.”

“Old madam CEN continued, “When are you going to bring someone back to take a look? If it’s suitable, you can make a decision earlier. You’re not young anymore.” ”

“Although CEN Yuyan was usually uninteresting and did not have a good mind, she was still her granddaughter after all. Old Madam Cen was still very concerned about the important matters of her life. Old Madam Cen never favored any granddaughter. ”

“Cen Yuyan was almost forty years old. Old Mrs. Cen had previously asked someone to introduce many high-quality young men to her, but Cen Yuyan did not take a fancy to them. ”

“”Yes, Grandma.”Cen Yuyan continued to nod. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen added, “But I have to say, don’t bring those crooked melon dates to me!” ”

“”Don’t worry.”Cen Yuyan said very seriously, “Zhou Rui is not that crooked melon dates.” ”

“Although she had not known Zhou Rui for a long time, Cen Yuyan knew Zhou Rui very well. ”

Zhou Rui was a person with very strong willpower.

“If it was not for him, the Zhou family would not have come out from the countryside. ”

“Although the Zhou family was nothing in the eyes of the Cen family, among ordinary people, they were already considered top-notch existences. ”

“Just the villa of the Zhou family alone was worth more than ten million. Moreover, the Zhou family had hired a nanny. These were all expenses. ”

How could an ordinary family live in a large villa?

How could they hire two nannies?

“Old Mrs. Cen added, “And don’t forget to bring those Phoenix men with me! Actually, Little Lu is quite good. It’s a pity that the two of you aren’t fated!” ”

“Cen Yuyan looked at Old Mrs. Cen and continued, “Grandma, don’t worry. Zhou Rui will definitely satisfy you! “It’s useless for me to tell you so much now. When you see him, you’ll know that I didn’t misjudge him! “What Phoenix Guy? Pretty Boy? He has nothing to do with Zhou Rui.” ” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Old Mrs. Cen didn’t believe Cen Yuyan.

“Over the years, Cen Yuyan had dated no less than twenty times, but every time, it ended in failure. ”

“”Bring him back first.”Old Mrs. Cen continued, “I think next Wednesday will be pretty good. Why Don’t you bring him back next Wednesday?” ”

Cen Yuyan seemed to hesitate for a moment before nodding.

“Old Mrs. Cen waved her hand and said, “Alright, you can go back and rest first.” ”

Cen Yuyan walked upstairs.

...

“At eight o’clock the next night, Zhou Rui and Cen Yuyan came to Pearl Square to watch a movie. ”

“Before they left, Zhou Rui specially sent song Chenyu a text message. ”

“As soon as he entered the square, Zhou Rui looked around. Soon, he saw song Chenyu’s figure. The two of them looked at each other. As their eyes exchanged, Zhou Rui’s phone suddenly rang. ”

Zhou Rui picked up the phone. “Hello? What’s Wrong?”

“He didn’t know what was said on the other end, but Zhou Rui continued, “I’m accompanying my girlfriend right now. I don’t have time!” ”

“When she heard this, Cen Yuyan immediately looked up at Zhou Rui. “Zhou Rui, if you have something to do, go and do your work first! I’m fine, I don’t need you to accompany me!” ”

Zhou Rui hugged Cen Yuyan’s shoulder. “Nothing is more important than accompanying you.”

“”Hurry up and get busy!”CEN Yuyan continued, “Come and find me when you’re Done!” ”

“But...”Zhou Rui was a little hesitant.

“Cen Yuyan deliberately put on a stern face. “Zhou Rui, didn’t you say that you have to listen to me in everything?” ”

“Only then did Zhou Rui Compromise. “Alright, Alright, Alright. Little Grandaunt, can’t I listen to You?” ”

“”That’s more like it.”Cen Yuyan smiled and said, “Hurry up and get busy.” ”

Zhou Rui kissed Cen Yuyan before turning around to leave.

“All of this was seen by Song Chenyu, who was hiding in the corner. ”

Song Chenyu narrowed his eyes.

Zhou Rui was indeed capable.

“Looking at Cen Yuyan’s appearance, he knew that Cen Yuyan loved Zhou Rui dearly. ”

“Thinking of this, the corners of Song Chenyu’s mouth curled up into a mocking smile. ”

Cen Yuyan could be considered to be an old tree in spring.

“Although Zhou Rui wasn’t a good person, Cen Yuyan was still quite old. Cen Yuyan really didn’t lose out. ”

“After a moment, song Chenyu composed his expression and walked to Cen Yuyan’s side. With red eyes, he said, “Yuyan.” ”

“Seeing song Chenyu, Cen Yuyan frowned slightly. “Why are you here?” ”

“Song Chenyu continued, “Yuyan, I’m here to apologize to you. I hope you can give me a chance to explain.” ”

“”There’s no need to explain.”In a public place, Cen Yuyan tried her best to suppress her voice, “Song Chenyu, I can see through who you are now! There’s no need for you to put on a fake act in front of me! I Won’t believe you anymore!” ”

“”Yuyan, things are really not what you think.” ”
