Translator: 549690339

“Looking at the sumptuous breakfast on the table, Yin Wei gulped. “This is called casually cooking?” ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Let’s deal with it this morning. I forgot to ask you what you want to eat before going to bed last night. You can order your own dishes tomorrow morning.” ”

“”Yezi, I love you so much!”Yin Wei hugged ye Zao excitedly. She was very glad that she was in the same group as ye Zao. ”

The two girls were just about to eat breakfast when Wei Xingzhi and Chang Yu walked out.

“When they saw the breakfast on the table, the two of them were also very surprised. ”

“After the four of them finished eating breakfast, the three members of the Blue Team walked out of the room. ”

“Seeing that ye Zao and the others were already eating breakfast, song yiwan smiled and said, “The program team is too humane! They actually provided breakfast! Director, Where’s Our Breakfast?” ”

“They had not eaten their fill last night, and it was already past nine in the morning. They were so hungry that they felt dizzy. ”

“Seeing that the program team had thoughtfully prepared breakfast, the few of them were very excited. ”

“The director said expressionlessly, “Team Blue’s breakfast was made by Ye Zi herself.” ”

Made by herself?

“Hearing this, the few of them felt their hearts turn cold. ”

“Then what do we eat in the morning?”Song Yiwan looked at the director.

“You guys figure it out yourselves!”

“Ye Zhuo drank a mouthful of soy milk and said with a smile, “If you guys are hungry, you can come here and eat some. I’ve made a lot anyway.” ”

“Ye Zhuo spoke up, and Wei xingzhi echoed, “Yezi is right. We still have a lot of breakfast left. Why Don’t you guys come over and eat some?” ”

They looked at each other and saw hesitation in each other’s eyes.

“If they went over to eat, wouldn’t they betray song Chenyu? ”

No!

They couldn’t go over to eat!

They couldn’t!

“Wang Xuancheng smiled and said, “Thank you, Yezi. Thank you, teacher Wei. But there’s no need. We’ll think of a way ourselves.” ”

“After saying that, the few of them walked to the side. ”

“Lu Qi continued, “Yi Wan, Xuancheng, Chenyu cooked it for us last night. Why don’t the three of us give Chenyu a surprise in the morning?” ”

“Sure!”The three of them nodded in agreement.

They would rather cook it themselves than eat that kind of dirty food.

In a flash.

A week’s time passed.

“After the first episode of the program had been recorded, they had to wait until this month to continue recording the second episode. ”

“During this month’s free time, everyone would go home and look for their own mothers. ”

Ye Zao had booked a flight at around 10 am. The program team’s car sent her to the airport.

“The director personally sent ye Zao off. “Miss Ye, let’s meet again next month.” ”

“”Let’s meet again next month.”Ye Zao continued, “By the way, director Feng, when will our program be broadcast?” ”

“Director Feng said, “If nothing unexpected happens, it should be broadcast in a week’s time. As for the exact broadcast time, our group will inform You Then.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded.

“Director Feng continued, “Have a safe journey.” ”

“”Thank you, director Feng. Have a safe journey too.” ”

“After saying goodbye to director Feng, Ye Zhuo pulled her suitcase and walked towards the boarding gate. ”

“At this moment, a pair of slender hands suddenly came from behind ye Zhuo’s waist. One of them was holding a string of Buddhist beads. Then, her entire body fell into a broad chest, her nose was filled with the fresh scent of mint and the faint scent of sandalwood. ”

“Leader.”

“A deep and magnetic voice came from beside her ear, and the warm breath sprayed on her neck. ”

It was slightly itchy.

Ye Zao smiled. “Why are you here?”

“I missed you.”

“Cen Shaoqing hugged her tightly, buried his head in her neck, rubbed against it, and took a deep breath. ”

It was only when he hugged her like this.

Cen Shaoqing could feel a moment of peace.

“Hiss...”ye Zao frowned slightly.

“What’s Wrong?”

Ye Zao raised his eyebrows. “You didn’t shave?”

“”Did I prick you?”Cen Shaoqing immediately raised his head and asked nervously, “Does it hurt?” ”

Cen Shaoqing was much taller than ye Zao.

His Chin was just above ye Zao’s head.

Ye Zao raised his head and saw that this person’s chin was already showing stubble. His fair skin had a faint greenish-black color. There was an indescribable sexiness to it. Ye Zao reached out and touched it.

It was a little prickly.

“”It’s not too painful,”ye Zao continued, “Why did you come over without even shaving your beard?” ”

“In Ye Zao’s eyes, Cen Shaoqing had always been a very particular person. ”

Such a situation.

It was rare.

“CEN Shaoqing said, “I just finished my meeting and took the plane over.”Cen Shaoqing’s hair was full of fur, and he basically shaved every two days. ”

“Before he met ye Zao, Cen Shaoqing did everything at a moderate pace, and his expression did not change even when Mount Tai collapsed in front of him. ”

“After meeting ye Zao, he had someone in his heart that he wanted to meet, so he could not care about anything else. ”

“After finishing the things on hand, he couldn’t wait to get on the plane. ”

How could he care about whether he shaved or not?

“”I see.”Ye Zao nodded slightly and continued, “Then should we go back now, or stay here and rest for a day?” ”

“Why don’t we rest here for a day? Let’s Take a stroll around? This is my first time coming to the East Continent!”Cen Shaoqing said.

“Sure.”Ye Zhuo didn’t have any objections. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Therefore, the two of them found a hotel near the airport and stayed there. ”

The hotel had everything.

Cen Shaoqing found a razor to clean his beard.

Ye Zhuo leaned against the bathroom door and raised his eyebrows slightly. “I suddenly realized that you actually look quite manly with that little stubble of yours.”

“”Don’t tell me I don’t Look Manly Now?”Cen Shaoqing walked over and placed his hands on the door frame, trapping ye Zao between the door and him. ”

The two of them looked at each other.

Their eyes were filled with each other’s figures.

“In a flash, CEN Shaoqing extended a slender finger and lifted ye Zao’s chin. Then, his thin lips covered his red lips. ”

His lips were very thin and cold.

After an unknown amount of time.

Cen Shaoqing tilted his head slightly and moved his thin lips away from the corner of her lips. His breathing was a little hurried.

Ye Zao frowned slightly. “What did you put in your pocket?”

“Cen Shaoqing was stunned for a moment before he said, “My phone.” ”

His voice was low and hoarse.

Ye Zao did not think too much about it and nodded.

“Cen Shaoqing hurriedly released ye Zao and said, “Leader, I’m going to take a shower. You can go out for a while.” ”

“Didn’t you just take a shower once?”Ye Zao was very confused.

Cen Shaoqing’s expression was the same as usual. “I have the habit of taking a shower twice.”

“OH.”Ye Zao nodded and walked out of the door.

“Not long after, the sound of running water came from the bathroom. ”

The two of them opened a suite.

Ye Zao also returned to his room to take a shower.

“After taking a shower, the two of them went out to visit the night market in the East Continent. ”

It was very lively near the airport.

“Because of the climate in the East continent, it was too hot during the day and no one was willing to come out. At night, there were people everywhere and it was very lively. ”

“The two of them walked hand in hand in the night market. After a while, it was ye Zao who walked in front and Cen Shaoqing who followed behind with a pile of food. ”

The weather in the east continent was good.

There were also many delicacies.

There were also all kinds of fruits that ye Zao had never seen before.

“Song Chenyu wore sunglasses and also walked in the night market. She held a cup of milk tea that she had drunk half of, as well as other delicacies. ”

“Recently, the program team of “Country”was in the East Continent. After many paparazzi found out about this, they all came over to take a look. ”

The reason why song Chenyu chose this most lively night market was so that the paparazzi could take pictures of her.

“After all, she had set up the character of a foodie. ”

“If she didn’t go to the Gourmet Street in the East Continent, she would definitely be criticized by the anti-fans. ”

“At this moment, Song Chenyu suddenly saw a tall figure. ”

“He was wearing a plain robe and walking in the middle of the crowd, making him stand out from the crowd. ”

This Is?

Cen Shaoqing!
