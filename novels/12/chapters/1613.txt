Translator: 549690339

“When she thought of that scene, Tang Xue was extremely excited. The corners of her mouth curled into a proud arc.”

“At that time, she would return all the humiliation she had suffered today to Ye Zhuo!”

She would let ye Zhuo know what a true proud daughter of the heavens was!

Ye Zhuo did not even have the right to shine shoes.

“”Two years?”Bai Yun said speechlessly, “Sister! You want me to wait for two years! ?””

“”The two-year agreement has already passed for more than a year. Don’t worry, I Won’t make you wait for two years,”Tang Xue said.”

“Really?”Bai Yun asked in disbelief.

“”Yes.”Tang Xue nodded. “So, you go back and wait first. During this period of time, I’ll think of other ways for you. Perhaps you don’t need to wait for the two-year agreement.””

“With her popularity in the base, it wouldn’t be a problem to place someone inside”

“Even if Zhou Guangwei, that ungrateful wretch, didn’t help her, there were still others.”

“”Okay.”Bai Yun nodded and continued, “I don’t want to go back so soon. Can I walk around here?””

Tang Xue hesitated.

“The base wasn’t like other places. If Bai Yun got into trouble, it wouldn’t be easy to end things.”

“Seeing Tang Xue Like This, Bai Yun was a little speechless and said, “No Way? Sister, you don’t even have this little bit of authority?”It was fine if she wasn’t allowed to pass the assessment, but now she actually didn’t even have the authority to walk around the base.”

“”Who says I don’t Have It!”Tang Xue took out a work badge and gave it to Bai Yun, “Put on my work badge, but remember one thing, there are some places here that are not allowed to take photos. Take care of yourself, and don’t stir up trouble!””

“Seeing Tang Xue’s work badge, Bai Yun’s eyes lit up. She immediately took it with both hands and said with a smile, “Sister, thank you! Don’t worry, I Promise I won’t cause any trouble for you.””

“Let’s go quickly.”

Bai Yun wore her work badge and walked out with satisfaction.

The Cen family’s base was very big.

“Because of her work badge, Bai Yun received many greetings along the way.”

“Tang Gong!”

“”Good afternoon, Miss Tang.””

“This was the first time Bai Yun had taken the initiative to be greeted by someone. Moreover, the person who greeted her was full of respect. For a moment, her vanity exploded.”

He held his head high and puffed out his chest. It was as if he had become some great official.

“According to the instructions of the base, Bai Yun came all the way to the lounge.”

The lounge was divided into four floors.

The first and second floors were the dining area.

The third and fourth floors were the entertainment area.

“All the food and entertainment facilities here were free. However, only the researchers of the CEN’s base could come in and eat for free.”

“Bai Yun had Tang Xue’s work card, so he swaggered into the dining area on the first floor.”

“The dining area was very large. The first and second floors added up to a total of more than 3,000 square meters.”

“The variety of food was even more colorful, gathering delicacies from all over the place.”

He could eat as much as he wanted.

But there was one condition.

No waste.

EAT as much as you take.

It was said that this rule was changed after ye Zhuo came to the base.

“Before this, the act of wasting was still very serious.”

Bai Yun found a seat and sat down.

“Immediately, someone came over. “Tang Gong, what would you like to eat?””

“Bai Yun thought for a moment and then said, “I’d like a medium-rare M 9 steak.””

“”Okay, please wait a moment.””

“Bai Yun had only said that she would try it, but she didn’t expect that there would really be M 9 Here!”

“”Wait a moment,”Bai Yun continued.”

“Do you need anything else?”The attendant turned around.

“”I want another bottle of Veen mineral water,”Bai Yun said, “Do you have it?””

“”Yes, please wait a moment.”The attendant nodded.”

“This time, Bai Yun could not remain calm.”

This CEN base was too rich!

“They even provided m 9 steak and Veen mineral water, and they did not even need money!”

“M 9 steaks were four figures per catty, and Veen’s mineral water was 157 yuan per bottle. If these two things were added together, it would cost at least 700 to 800 yuan. If the Cen’s base workers ate like this.., how much money would they have to eat in a day?” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Bai Yun licked his lips and felt that he had to stay and work in the Cen’s base.

The benefits were too good!

“Soon, the steak and mineral water were brought up.”

“Before eating, Bai Yun took a photo with her phone.”

“After eating the steak, Bai Yun wanted to go to the bar to get some tissues to wipe her mouth.”

“At this moment, a thin young woman walked over and said with a smile, “Miss Tang, do you want some paper? I have some here!””

“Thank you.”Bai Yun took the paper.

“”You’re welcome.”The young woman continued, “It’s my honor for Miss Tang to be able to use my paper.””

Bai Yun was stunned.

So Tang Xue had such a high status in the base?

But why didn’t she even have the authority to arrange for her to enter the base?
