“”Grandma,”Feng Xianxian held onto Old Lady Lin’s hand, “I really don’t mind.””

Old Lady Lin still dragged Feng Xianxian out.

“Seeing that Old Lady Lin insisted on taking her away, Feng Xianxian continued, “Grandma, even if you want to move, you have to wait until tomorrow. It’s already so late!””

“Hearing this, Old Lady Lin calmed down a little. “Alright, then we’ll move tomorrow! I’ll get the housekeeper to find you a bachelor apartment with better conditions.””

“Feng Qianxian looked at Old Lady Lin, her face full of guilt. “Grandma, my mom did that to you. I’m already very happy that you can forgive me. You really don’t have to be so nice to me. I Can’t take it.””

Feng Xianxian had been by Old Lady Lin’s side for so long. She knew Old Lady Lin too well.

She had deliberately let Old Lady Lin see all this.

“In order to make Old Lady Lin feel sorry for her, Feng Xianxian had specially looked for a demolition house with the worst conditions when she was looking for a house.”

As expected.

“When Old Lady Lin saw this scene, she immediately couldn’t sit still.”

“Silly Child!”Old Lady Lin held Feng Qianxian’s hand. “Those things were all done by your mother. What has it got to do with you? You mustn’t blame yourself!”

“”Grandma, Thank You!”Feng Qianxian hugged Old Lady Lin emotionally and the corners of her mouth curled up.”

Old Lady Lin patted Feng Qianxian’s back and couldn’t help but cough twice.

“Feng Xianxian narrowed her eyes and immediately asked with concern, “Grandma, have you recovered yet?””

“The look in Old Lady Lin’s eyes dimmed. She coughed once and Feng Xianxian immediately noticed it. However, the people at home seemed to be invisible. “It’s just a little cough. It’s not a big deal.”” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“”Grandma, your health is more important.”Feng Xianxian continued, “You’re right. Why are you running out in such a cold day? You should be resting at home!””

“With Feng Xianxian’s concern for her, old madam Lin felt much better. She turned to look at Auntie Wang. “Auntie Wang, quickly bring out the food that I brought for Xianxian!””

“Okay.”Auntie Wang nodded.

“Old Madam Lin continued, “Xianxian, you haven’t had dinner yet, right? Grandma brought you some delicious food.””

“”Thank you, Grandma.””

Auntie Wang brought over the insulated box. Inside the insulated box were all the food that Feng Xianxian liked to eat.

“Although Feng Qianxian had already had her dinner, she still pretended to eat happily.”

“Is it good?”Old Lady Lin asked.

“Feng Qianxian nodded. “It’s good! Grandma, You’re the best to me!””

“After dinner, Feng Qianxian sent Old Lady Lin out of the neighborhood. As she walked, she told Old Lady Lin to take good care of her body, so she brought up the old matter again, “Grandma, Sister Ye Zao must be at home right now, right? I think you should look for Sister Ye Zao when you have time. Otherwise, it won’t work if you keep delaying. Sister Ye Zao’s medical skills are so good, she must have a way.””

The look in Old Lady Lin’s eyes was turning cold bit by bit.

Let Ye Zao Treat Her?

What’s the difference between letting ye Zao treat her and waiting for death?

“From the corner of her eyes, Feng Xianxian noticed Old Lady Feng’s expression and the corners of her mouth curled up into a proud smile.”

Just wait.

“One day, she would let ye Zao have a taste of falling from the clouds!”

The Lin family’s car stopped at the entrance of the residential area and sent Old Lady Lin into the car. Feng Xianxian instructed the driver to drive carefully.

“Old Lady Lin looked at Feng Xianxian. “Xianxian, I will get the butler to help you move tomorrow. Remember not to go out tomorrow.””

“Feng Xianxian nodded. “Alright, then I’ll have to trouble you.””

“”Silly Child, why are you telling Grandma that it’s not troublesome?””

“As she watched the black car disappear into the snowy night, Feng Xianxian’s face was full of sarcasm, and the viciousness in her eyes almost seeped out.”

“Miss Feng.”

“At this moment, a gentle female voice appeared behind Feng Xianxian.”

Feng Xianxian turned around and saw a figure with a fairy-like aura.

It was Liu Caiyi.

“On a cold December Day, Liu Caiyi was wearing a white dress. Standing under the white snow, she looked exceptionally pure.”

Feng Xianxian recognized at a glance that this dress was ZY’s temperature-adjustable air-conditioner.

“ZY’s temperature-adjustable clothes were very mature. Now, in the cold December day, there were more and more people wearing a dress.”

“President Liu.”

“Seeing Liu Caiyi again, Feng Xianxian felt a myriad of emotions. The last time she saw Liu Caiyi, she was still a cousin of the Feng family, the granddaughter of the Lin family.”

“At this time, she had actually become the daughter of a prisoner who had attempted murder.”
