“Chapter 973: 221: a dragon has a reverse scale, it will be enraged if it is touched! 2”

“Unfortunately, it had been so long, and no one had seen ZY’s behind-the-scenes boss in person.”

“I don’t know.”Song Shiyu’s face was expressionless.

“Bai Jiayu glanced at song Shiyu. “She is your partner, after all. Aren’t you curious about who she is?””

“Not interested.”

“Bai Jiayu narrowed his eyes as if he suddenly remembered something, he continued, “Oh right, what’s up with that sister of yours? Didn’t you treat her quite well before? Why are you so ruthless all of a sudden? You even changed her surname back?””

“Song Chenyu had been praised so highly back then, but now he had fallen so hard.”

Song Shiyu loosened his tie. “It’s nothing. I just feel that she doesn’t deserve to have the surname Song.”

“Bai Jiayu was even more curious now. “Brother song, What’s Going On?””

“Although Bai Jiayu didn’t know song Chenyu very well, he had interacted with him a few times. Song Chenyu was a cautious person, and he was even more respectful to Song Shiyu.”

“Logically speaking, song Shiyu shouldn’t have hated her that much.”

“At that time, Bai Jiayu didn’t know that there was a saying:”

“A dragon has a reverse scale, if you touch it, you will be angry!”

Song Shiyu’s reverse scale was the person he had placed in his heart and tattooed on his arm.

“Are you that free?”Song Shiyu lowered his head and glanced at him.

“Three months ago, song Shiyu had asked him the same question. After that, he had been sent to Africa by song Shiyu on a business trip.”

“Bai Jiayu immediately waved his hand. “I’m not free, I’m not free at all. I’ll leave Right Now!””

On the other side.

XI weiyue carried bags of food and went to little half moon to see ye Langhua.

“Aunt.”

Xiao Mei walked out of the house and smiled as she took the things from Xi Weiyue’s hands. “Aunt Lang went for a walk.”

“XI weiyue nodded and continued, “Has that Mr. Cao come over these few days?””

“No.”Xiao Mei shook her head.

“When she heard that Cao Wei did not come to look for ye Langhua anymore, Xi Weiyue heaved a sigh of relief and continued, “How’s My Aunt’s health these past few days?””

“”Pretty good.”Xiao Mei continued, “Aunt Lang has been taking her medicine on time these past few days. The Doctor Zhao who examined her body said that she’s recovering very well, so you don’t have to worry about her.””

“Because she was overly worried, ye Langhua’s health had been in a bad condition, and the medicine did not taste good either. She was using this method to punish herself. After all, if it was not for her negligence at that time, she would not have been lost for half a month, now that she heard that Cao Wei could help her find half a month, ye Langhua started to take the medicine properly.”

“When she heard this, Xi Weiyue narrowed her eyes.”

“This ingrate was an ingrate. She had been filial to ye Langhua for so many years, and she had even personally brewed medicine for her many times, but ye Langhua had never once accepted her love.”

“Now that she heard that it was possible to find half a month, she immediately changed into a different person.”

“Even though Xiao Banyue was her biological daughter, in the past 30 years, Xiao Banyue had never shown her the filial piety that a daughter should show.”

She had always been the one who showed filial piety to ye Langhua. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“But in the end, she still could not compare to ye Langhua’s biological daughter.”

Just thinking about it made her heart turn cold!

“”That’s good.”Xi Weiyue nodded without changing her expression. “I’ve always been worried about aunt’s health. Now that I hear you say that, I’m much more relieved. Oh right, where did aunt go for a walk? I’ll go check on her.””

“Xiao Mei said, “I saw her heading west with the bread. She should be looking for Zhou Mai.””

“Zhou Mai was a wandering mother. A few years ago, her biological daughter had gone missing nearby. Ever since then, she had been wandering nearby while looking for her biological son. Unfortunately, after three years of searching, her husband had already remarried, however, she still could not find her son.”

“In order to find her son, Zhou Mai had even cut off relations with her family.”

Her in-laws felt that she was too stubborn.

Wasn’t it just a child?

“Adults had tried their best. If they really could not find her, they would have to return to the family to continue living. They were still young, so they could definitely have another child.”

“However, Zhou Mai was extremely stubborn. She would not stop until she found a child. In the end, she broke up with her in-laws and ended up getting a divorce.”

“Zhou Mai was an orphan herself. After divorcing her husband, she was not in the mood to work. In the end, she became a homeless vagrant.”

“Xi Weiyue nodded. “Then, I’ll go take a look.””

“When she left, Xi Weiyue did not forget to bring a box of pastries.”

“Xi Weiyue came to the entrance of the alley. As expected, she saw ye Langhua chatting with Zhou Mai. Perhaps it was because they shared the same illness, but every time the two of them were together, there would always be endless topics to talk about.”

“”Auntie, Mai Jie.””

Xi Weiyue walked over.
