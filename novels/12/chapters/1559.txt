100 million was nothing to the Lin Family?

“Mother Zhang was stunned, then she smiled and said, “What nonsense are you talking about, child! This is a villa! Do you think it’s cabbage? You can buy it as you wish!””

“”Mom, you are right. In the future, when your daughter buys a villa, it will really be like buying cabbage!”Zhang Qingqing said with a smile.”

“What? ! You won the lottery?”Mother Zhang asked.

“Zhang Qingqing continued, “Mom, I’m pregnant. I’m getting married.””Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Pregnant?

Married?

“On the other end, mother Zhang exploded, “Qingqing, what nonsense are you talking about! How did you get pregnant! Do you know how old you are this year!””

“”Mom, aren’t you going to ask who my fiancé is?”Zhang Qingqing asked back.”

“Mother Zhang felt that there was a hidden meaning in Zhang Qingqing’s words. Her daughter had always had her own opinions, so she wouldn’t do something that didn’t know her limits. After a while, mother Zhang asked again, “Who is that man?””

“”What do you mean by that man!”Zhang Qingqing said speechlessly, “Your words are too harsh. He is your daughter’s fiancé, and also your future son-in-law!””

“I’m too lazy to waste time with you. Just tell me who he is!”Zhang Qingqing’s mother said.

“Zhang Qingqing continued, “His name is Lin Ze, and he is the young master of the LIN Group in Beijing! Mom, you should know about the LIN Group, right?””

“As soon as she said this, there was a moment of silence on the other end of the phone. Although she could not see what was happening on the other end, Zhang Qingqing could imagine the expressions on her parents’faces at this moment. They must be both surprised and pleasantly surprised!”

“At this moment, a voice came from the other end of the line again. “Qingqing, are you talking about the LIN Corporation of Simu International?””

“At this moment, father Zhang’s voice came through.”

“Zhang Qingqing snorted lightly and continued, “Simu? Simu is nothing! Dad, listen carefully, it’s the Lin Corporation of Hao Ren!””

Hao Ren.

“Father Zhang was also a businessman, so he naturally knew what Hao Ren represented.”

“In the capital, besides the CEN Group, there was also the LIN Group!”

“”Qingqing,”father Zhang was so excited that he couldn’t even speak clearly. “You, are you sure?””

Father Zhang never expected that Zhang Qingqing would become the daughter-in-law of the LIN Group.

“”Dad, how could I be wrong about this!”Zhang Qingqing continued, “You and mom should find a time to come to the capital. Mr. Lin and Mrs. Lin want to meet with you and settle things as soon as possible.””

“Father Zhang continued, “Qingqing, is dad really not dreaming?””

“Zhang Qingqing smiled and said, “How could you have such a good dream?””

“On the other side, father Zhang pinched his thigh hard until he felt an intense pain at the base of his thigh. Only then did he dare to believe that all of this was real! All of this was real!”

“”Qingqing, your mother just told me that you are pregnant now?”Father Zhang continued to ask.”

“”Yes,”Zhang Qingqing continued, “That’s why I told you to come to Beijing as soon as possible!””

“Father Zhang said excitedly, “Good, good, good! Qingqing, take good care of the baby. Don’t let anything happen to it. Your mother and I, we’ll Be There Tomorrow!””

“Okay.”

“After hanging up the phone, Father Zhang wanted to cheer out loud.”

That was the Lin Family!

The Lin family of Beijing!

A giant in the business world.

“In the past, when the Lin family was mentioned, he was always envious. He didn’t expect that he would actually become in-laws with Lin Jincheng this time.”

“In the future, let’s see who would dare to look down on the Zhang Family!”

The Qiao Family?

What was the Qiao Family?

It was fine if he didn’t want such a snobbish daughter-in-law.

“As long as he had money, what kind of wife could Zhang Lei not marry?”

“Father Zhang turned to look at mother Zhang and said, “Quick, quickly call lei lei and tell him to come back quickly. The three of us will go to Beijing together!””

“What about Qiao Yue’s side?”Mother Zhang asked.

“Father Zhang smiled and said, “Didn’t they look down on our family? Then we won’t get married. Let them regret it!””

“Mother Zhang nodded. “Yes, you’re right! Let them regret it! I’ll go and contact Lei Lei Now!””

“After Zhang Lei returned, he booked a plane ticket overnight and prepared to fly to Beijing the next day.”

On the other side.

“At 12 pm, Ye Zhuo returned home.”

“It was rare that no one in the family slept. Other than Lin Ze, Lin Jincheng, Ye Shu, Old Madam Lin, and Ye Langhua were all sitting in the living room waiting for her.”

“”Zhuozhuo!”Seeing her return, ye Shu stood up from her chair.”

“Ye Zha placed the car keys on the coffee table. “Mom, it’s already 12 o’clock. Why aren’t you guys going to bed?””

“”Waiting for you!”Ye Shu continued, “Zha Zha. Did you go to look for Zhang Qingqing yesterday during the day?””
