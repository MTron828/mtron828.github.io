Chapter 866: 196: ‘I’m convinced'(8th watch)2

Translator: 549690339

“But after eating ye Zhuo’s dishes, he didn’t feel anything when he saw song Chenyu cooking.”

Compared to ye Zhuo’s dishes.

Song Chenyu’s five dishes could only be considered common meals.

“”Chenyu, you’re really amazing!””

“These dishes look so delicious!”

“”Chenyu, you can even become a chef!””

The three of them sat at the dining table and praised song Chenyu.

“Song Chenyu smiled and said, “It’s just a few dishes. It’s nothing. Everyone has been hungry for a whole day. Let’s start eating.””

Lu Qi was the first to pick up the chopsticks and pick up a piece of green vegetable. He had just put it into his mouth.

His expression was a little subtle.

The taste of the dishes was indeed not bad.

But he seemed to have eaten a grain of sand.

It should be an illusion?

“The taste of this dish was so good, how could there be sand?”

Lu Qi tried to chew a few more times.

Crack crack —

It was not an illusion.

“The sand stuck on his teeth, and it was very uncomfortable.”

Lu Qi subconsciously wanted to spit out the sand.

But at this time.

“A bunch of cameras were pointed at them, so he could not spit it out. If he did, wouldn’t it be a slap to song Chenyu’s face?”

“After all, Song Chenyu’s cooking was something that all the fans on the Internet knew.”

“Therefore, Lu Qi could only forcefully swallow the sand.”

Song Yiwan’s expression was also a little bad.

She was eating fish.

Although the taste of the fish was very good.

However.

“After picking up a piece of meat, song Yiwan realized that the belly of the fish didn’t seem to be cut open...”

The internal organs were still in the belly.

Just thinking about it made her feel a little disgusted.

“Song Yiwan tried her best to hide the disgust in her eyes. She endured the disgust and ate the fish meat. Then, she said in surprise, “Oh my God! The taste of this fish is too good! Chenyu, you’re really amazing!””

“Song Chenyu smiled and looked up. “If it’s delicious, then you should eat more. The three of you have been tired all day.””

“Song Yiwan picked up a piece of vegetables for song Chenyu. “Chenyu, eat more at home too.””

Wang Xuancheng was extremely hungry.

He picked up the rice and took a big bite of the rice with the vegetables.

He took a bite.

He was completely stunned.

The rice was raw.

There was sand in the vegetables.

Didn’t they say that song Chenyu was very good at cooking?

But why did this happen?’

Could it be that he fainted from hunger and was hallucinating?

Wang Xuancheng took another bite of the rice.

It was the same feeling.

The rice was not cooked.

The vegetables were not washed clean.

“The vegetables could not be eaten, so Wang Xuancheng picked up a piece of fish. When he saw the situation below the belly of the fish, Wang Xuancheng wanted to throw away his chopsticks.”

The fish was not dissected!

Wang Xuancheng put the fish in the bowl as usual and took a bite of the rice.

“Although there was something wrong with song Chenyu’s dishes, the three of them did not show anything. Instead, they smiled and said, “MMM, not bad! The taste of these dishes is really good! Chenyu, you are so amazing!””

Song Chenyu curled her lips slightly.

Everyone’s reaction was within her expectations.

After all...

She had practiced before. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Song Chenyu picked up a piece of green vegetable and said with a smile, “Actually, my skills are just so-so. You guys are flattering me too much.””

“When a piece of green vegetable entered her mouth, song Chenyu’s expression changed.”

“The green vegetable had not been washed clean, and there was sand in it.”

The green vegetables in the mountains were different from those in the city’s vegetable market.

“The vegetables sold in the vegetable market were all hydroponic. They could be washed casually, and there was no sand at all.”

“But the vegetables in the mountains were grown with sand. If they were not washed clean, they could eat sand.”

But it was not her fault.

“After all, she had never washed vegetables before!”

Who knew that the vegetables here were different from the vegetables in the vegetable market.

“It was her first time washing vegetables, and it was already very difficult for her to wash them like this.”

“Although there was sand in the vegetables, at least the taste was very good.”

Ye Zhuo’s cooking was definitely worse than hers!

“Compared to Team Red, they were much happier.”

“Thinking of this, song Chenyu felt a little better.”

“After eating a few mouthfuls of rice, song Yiwan put down her chopsticks and smiled. “I have a fat-prone physique, so I can’t eat too much tonight. You guys eat slowly, I’m going to take a shower first.””

“Seeing song Yiwan put down her chopsticks, Wang Xuancheng also put down his chopsticks immediately. “I can’t eat too much tonight either.””

Song Chenyu’s dishes were really difficult to swallow.

Wang Xuancheng would rather go back and secretly eat instant noodles!

“Fortunately, when he got off the plane, he packed some instant noodles into his suitcase.”

He still had to live here for six days.

That was the first day.

What about the remaining six days?

“She couldn’t keep eating instant noodles, could she?”

“Song Chenyu maintained her smile. “Then hurry up and take a shower. I’m not going to eat any more. I have to eat some more.”Other than the once-in-five-thousand-years beauty persona, Song Chenyu also had a foodie persona.”

“No matter how bad the food tasted, she had to eat more in front of the camera.”

This was also one of the reasons why song Chenyu didn’t want to participate in a reality show.

“Because without realizing it, it was possible for the character to fall apart.”

It was actually quite tiring to work so hard to maintain the character.

Twenty minutes later.

“Lu Qi braced herself and finished the rice in the bowl. “Chenyu, are you done eating? I’m going to wash the dishes.””

Song Chenyu smiled and put down the bowl and chopsticks. “I’m done eating. Let’s go wash the dishes together.”

“Lu Qi said, “We agreed that you would cook and I would wash the dishes. You’ve been tired all day. Go and rest for a while. I’ll wash the dishes.””

“Of course, song Chenyu would not let Lu Qi do the dishes alone. He continued, “It’s okay. I’m not tired.””

The two of them walked to the kitchen together.

The lights in the opposite kitchen were still on.

Ye Zhuo was busy steaming the lotus cake.

“Through the window, one could smell the fragrance.”

“The lotus flowers and Lotus leaves were picked from the fish pond this afternoon. They were very fresh, and the lotus cake made was extremely sweet.”

“Ye Zao tasted a piece of the lotus cake and narrowed his eyes in satisfaction. Then, he put the lotus cake on a plate and sent it to Wei Xingzhi, Chang Yu, and Yin Wei.”

“At this moment, the three of them were sitting in the living room chatting.”

“Yin Wei saw ye Zao coming over and turned around with a smile. “Yezi, where have you been? I haven’t seen you since I entered the house!””

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “I went to the kitchen to steam the lotus cake. You guys should try it too.””

“After saying that, ye Zao placed the lotus cake on the table.”

“You made this?”Wei Xingzhi looked at ye Zao in surprise.

“He didn’t expect ye Zao to not only know how to cook, but he also knew how to make desserts.”

“I made it.”Ye Zao nodded. He picked up a piece of lotus cake and ate it in one bite.

Yin Wei broke a piece of lotus cake into two halves. “I can’t eat too much sweet stuff at night. I’ll get fat. Who wants the other half?”

“Give it to me.”Chang Yu took the remaining half of the lotus cake.

Wei Xingzhi also tasted a piece.

“The Lotus cake tasted very good, but in order to not get fat, no one ate a second piece.”

Then they looked at ye Zao.

“After eating one piece after another, the plate was about to run out, but she had no intention of stopping.”

“Yin Wei gulped. “Yezi, aren’t you afraid of gaining weight?””

“This kind of lotus cake had a lot of sugar, fat, and calories... ... just a small bite was comparable to a big bowl of rice. If it wasn’t for her gluttony, Yin Wei wouldn’t even dare to eat half a piece.”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “It’s okay. I eat like this every day.””

“It was also because of the limited conditions. Otherwise, ye Zao would eat even more!”

How could this be?

“”Every, every day?”Yin Wei looked at ye Zao in disbelief. “Did I hear wrong?””

Wei Xingzhi and Chang Yu also looked at Ye Zao.

Ye Zao nodded. “You didn’t hear wrong. I prefer sweet food.”

“Yin Wei continued, “You eat like this every day. Why are you still so thin?””

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Maybe I don’t have a fat body from eating?””
