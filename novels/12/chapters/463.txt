“Cen Yueya repeated what she said earlier, “I said searing send a new ZY limited edition product of 10 pieces worldwide! Quickly open it and take a look! What’s wrong with you today, Lass?” ”

Boom.

Cen Yuyan only felt her head buzzing.

ZY limited edition new product? !

And it was a global limited edition of 10 pieces?

Did she hear wrongly?

“After a long while, Cen Yuyan finally reacted. “Second sister, stop joking!” ”

“ZY’s global limited edition of 10 pieces of the new product had just been released three days ago. Cen Yuyan and her three assistants had been waiting in front of the computer for three whole hours, but they had not managed to snatch it! ”

Ye Zhuo had taken out six pieces at once?

“Even if one thought about it with one’s toes, one would know that it was impossible! ”

“Therefore, Cen Yueya was definitely joking with her. ”

“”Who’s joking with you?”Cen Yueya’s voice sounded again, “Fourth girl, if you don’t believe me, go and open the packaging and you’ll know! Big Sister, third girl and I have all sent their styles to the group. You can also take a photo of your clothes and send it to the group later. Let us take a look.” ”

“After saying that, Cen Yueya hung up. ”

Cen Yuyan quickly opened the wechat group chat.

The group chat had already exceeded 99 + .

Big Sister: [ picture JPG ] it’s my first time wearing the limited edition of ZY. I feel that the limited edition is really different! It looks good! ]

Second Sister: [ you guys don’t know how much my mother-in-law envied me when I went downstairs just now! ]

Third Sister: [ I feel that mine is the best looking one! No rebuttal! ]

Grandma: [ mine is obviously the best looking one! ]

Mom: [ I feel that none of yours is as good looking as mine. ]

Second Sister: [@stinky brother: What About Yours? What did searing give you? ]

“Grandma: [@stinky brother: Searing didn’t give you anything, right? ] ”

Third Sister: [@stinky little brother: onlookers eating melons [/the bewildered crowd eating melons ]

Mom: [@stinky little brother: Eating Melons + 2. ]

Big Sister: [@stinky little brother: Eating Melons + 3. ]

“Cen Yuyan quickly scrolled through the message, and her fair fingers finally stopped on a few pictures. ”

She opened the pictures and zoomed in.

It was indeed the new product of ZY.

There were no imitators of ZY temperature-adjustable clothes on the market.

That was because they imitated the style and could not imitate the high-tech technology that could adjust the temperature.

Therefore.

Zy had always been the dominant one on the market.

“If ye Zhuo had sent an a product, the sisters would have discovered it long ago. ”

In other words.

What ye Zhuo had sent was not some street stall.

What she had sent was really a limited edition ZY!

She had actually thrown ZY away! DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Thinking of this, Cen Yuyan was filled with regret. ”

She shouldn’t have been so impulsive.

No.

She had to get her things back.

Cen Yuyan rushed downstairs and found the nanny. “Nanny Liu!”

“Nanny Liu was sweeping the floor. When she saw Cen Yuyan running downstairs, she raised her head doubtfully. “What happened to fourth miss?”Cen Yuyan usually paid attention to her words and actions. She had never lost her composure. ”

“Cen Yuyan said anxiously, “Nanny Liu, where’s the Box I gave you just now? It’s the one that hasn’t been opened yet!” ”

“Nanny Liu said, “Fourth miss, didn’t you ask me to throw that away?” ”

“Speaking up to this point, nanny Liu said, “Could it be that there’s something important in that box of yours?” ”

“Cen Yuyan nodded. “Yes! Something very, very important! Nanny Liu, quickly bring the thing over to me.” ”

“Hearing this, Auntie Liu’s heart skipped a beat. “But, but I’ve already thrown it away.”At that time, Cen Yuyan was disgusted, so Auntie Liu immediately threw it away. ”

Who would have thought that Cen Yuyan would regret it in less than an hour?

Cen Yuyan’s eyes widened. “Where did you throw it?”

“Auntie Liu said, “I threw it in the garbage room.” ”

“As soon as mother Liu finished speaking, Cen Yuyan turned around and ran toward the garbage room. ”

Mother Liu quickly followed Cen Yuyan’s footsteps.

The garbage room was just behind the Villa District.

“When the two of them arrived, an uncle was cleaning the garbage can in the garbage room. ”

“It was summer, and the smell of the garbage room was really not very pleasant. ”

Cen Yuyan covered her nose and let mother Liu Ask.

“Mother Liu nodded and went forward to ask, “Uncle, where’s the garbage I sent over just now?” ”

The uncle raised his head and pointed in a direction. “It seems to be over there.”

“After getting the uncle’s answer, Cen Yuyan couldn’t care about anything else. She immediately ran in the direction of the garbage can and lowered her head to start rummaging through the garbage can. ”

There was everything in the garbage can.

The stench soared to the sky.

There were also green-headed flies flying around inside.
