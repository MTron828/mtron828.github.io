“Hearing this, Aunt Zhang and Feng Qianhua looked at each other.”

They could see the confusion in each other’s eyes.

What did ye Zao Mean by this sentence?

“Actually, Lin Jincheng and ye Shu were also a little confused. They did not know what ye Zao was up to.”

“Ye Zao brought them over, saying that he had something to announce.”

Ye Zao didn’t want to reveal the details of what it was.

“Now, he said that a guest was coming...”

“Looking at ye Zao’s face, Feng Qianhua was a little flustered for some reason, but she still managed to hide the fluster in her eyes. She smiled and looked up. “I wonder who the guest you want us to meet is?””

“”To be precise, it’s a relative who is related to you by blood, Auntie Feng.”Ye Zao smiled slightly and turned to look at the maid beside him. “Xiao Lan, go and invite the guest in.””

“Okay.”

Xiao Lan turned around and walked out of the door.

Relative?

Feng Qianhua’s heart became even more flustered.

She did not know what ye Zao was trying to do.

“Not long after, she brought in a white-haired, slightly plump woman who was over 60 years old.”

When she saw this person.

Aunt Zhang’s face instantly turned pale. The word ‘sister’was stuck in her throat and she could not pronounce it no matter how hard she tried.

“This was her biological sister, Xu Lanyue.”

How did ye Zhuo find Xu Lanyue?

Why did ye Zhuo bring Xu Lanyue Here?

Could it be...

That she knew everything?

“Feng Qianhua had not seen Xu Lanyue for many years. When she suddenly saw Xu Lanyue, she was a little stunned. All the memories that had been sealed in her mind surfaced in front of her eyes.”

Her legs felt weak.

“Old Lady Lin frowned. She did not know Xu Lanyue. She turned to look at Feng Qianhua. “Qianhua, is this your relative?”Old Lady Lin had seen all the relatives of the Feng family before.”

But this was the first time Old Lady Lin had seen this person.

Xu Lanyue did not look like she had come from a rich family.

When did the Feng family have such a poor relative?

“Feng Qianhua took two steps back, her face slightly pale. “I don’t know her, Aunt Lin. Maybe Zhuozhuo made a mistake!”” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Ye Zhuoqian curled her lips slightly. “Aunt Feng, this person is your biological aunt. Don’t tell me you don’t even recognize your own biological aunt?””

“”What biological aunt! Zhuozhuo, stop messing around!”Feng Qianhua looked up at Ye Zhuoqian and tried her best to suppress the fear in her voice. “I don’t understand what you’re saying!””

Although ye Zao didn’t say anything at the moment.

But Feng Qianhua had a feeling that ye Zao seemed to know something.

What did she know?

“Ye Zao raised his eyes slightly and a mocking look flashed in his eyes. “Oh, I forgot! Auntie Feng, you don’t even recognize your own mother, so what’s aunt?””

Biological Mother?

The color on Feng Qianhua’s face suddenly disappeared.

Could it be... Ye Zao knew everything?

“Aunt Zhang took a step forward and stood in front of Feng Qianhua, “Eldest miss, there are a lot of swindlers with ulterior motives these days, especially poor relatives who come knocking on your door. Don’t be deceived by some people!”! “Miss Qianhua has always been very filial to old madam Feng. If people who don’t know what you said heard this, they would really think that Miss Qianhua is a person without filial piety!”! “Misfortunes come from words. Miss, what do you mean by making up Miss Qianhua in front of old Madam Feng?””

“After all, Aunt Zhang had been through a lot, so her face did not show the slightest bit of surprise. She turned to look at Old Madam Lin and continued:”

“”Old Madam, Miss Qianhua is not related to you by blood. If she can be so filial to you, how can she not be filial to old Madam Feng? You must not be deceived by others and form any grudges against Miss Qianhua!””

“Speaking up to this point, Aunt Zhang glanced at Xu Lanyue.”

Xu Lanyue was Aunt Zhang’s biological sister.

Aunt Zhang believed that her biological sister would not betray her.

“However, Aunt Zhang did not catch the evasive look in Aunt Zhang’s eyes.”

“Old Madam Lin already felt sorry for Feng Qianhua. Now that she heard ye Zhuo make up Feng Qianhua like this, she naturally could not bear it. “Insulting the elders with empty words! Ye Zhuo, do you still have any manners?””

“After saying that, old Mrs. Lin looked at Lin Jincheng and ye Shu angrily. “How did you two Educate Your Daughter?””

“”Mom,”Lin Jincheng stood up and said, “Zao Zao is my daughter. I know her better than you! She has never been a child who causes trouble for no reason! Please listen to her first. She must have her own reasons for saying that.””

Old Madam Lin frowned tightly.

“Aunt Zhang hurriedly said, “Old Madam! Miss Qianhua is really not that kind of person! Although the eldest miss is your biological granddaughter, Miss Qianhua has been filial to you for so many years. Are you going to just watch as Miss Qianhua is humiliated?””
