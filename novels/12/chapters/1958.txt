Chapter 1959: 408: kick her out! -LRB-16th watch)1

Translator: 549690339

Xu Yao cried like a pear blossom in the rain.

“Mother Xu was aggressive, “I’m your mother! Can I still hurt you? Xu Yao, do you know what happens to a single girl who gives birth to a child out of wedlock? Have you ever thought about whether you want to be responsible for your child in the future! How are you going to explain this to your child when she grows up?” ”

“Actually, mother Xu’s words were meant for the he family’s parents to hear. ”

It was a double act!

“They played the good cop, Xu Yao played the bad cop. ”

“Between the two of them, Xu Yao became a good girl who could give up everything for love. ”

It was not easy being a single mother.

Xu Yao was able to bear such great pressure and keep the child. This was enough to prove that she was a good girl.

“”Mom, I understand everything you’re saying. Ziteng is currently lying in the ICU. His life and death are unknown. If I were to abort the child at this time, how sad would ziteng be? How Sad Would Ziteng’s parents be! “I don’t want to have an abortion, I really don’t! “Mom, I’m begging you, please don’t force me!” ”

“Mother Xu pointed at Xu Yao and said, “Then do you know that your behavior is very selfish! It’s not responsible for yourself, and it’s also not responsible for the child! “If you give birth to a child out of wedlock, no man will dare to have you in the future! “The child will have no father in the future, and he will be bullied when he enters society!” ”

“”Mother Xu Yao, don’t worry.”Mother he walked out at this time and looked at mother Xu. “In the future, Xu Yao will be the daughter-in-law of the He family. As long as the two of us are around, no one can bully Xu Yao!” ”

“Father he glanced at mother he, his eyes filled with shock. ”

He didn’t expect mother he to say such words.

“After all, mother he only had hatred for Xu Yao. ”

It was likely that Xu Yao had influenced mother he.

“The life and death of the boyfriend was unknown. Under normal circumstances, if it was someone else, they would definitely abort the child. ”

“Once a woman gave birth, she would change from a young girl to a woman. ”

“In the future, if she married someone, she would only be able to get married twice. ”

“Now, girls like Xu Yao were really rare! ”

Perhaps they had really misunderstood Xu Yao in the past.

“Hearing these words, Xu Yao’s lowered eyes were filled with pride. ”

She had thought that this old B * Tch Ouyang Xunfang was very powerful!

So it turned out that she was just so-so. She couldn’t even see through such tricks.

The child of an old fool was a little fool.

That fool he ziteng probably still didn’t understand why he had become like this.

“Mother Xu looked at mother he, “What you said sounded better than what you sang. Don’t think that I don’t know what you’re thinking! You’re just pretending because our Yaoyao is pregnant! When nothing happened to your he ziteng, I didn’t see you treat our Yaoyao so well!” ”

“Mother Xu said angrily, “You want to trick my daughter into giving birth to the child! I’m telling you, there’s no way! There’s not even a window! I Can’t let my daughter’s life be ruined by your he family!” ”

“Mom!”Xu Yao cried out sorrowfully.

“From her expression, no clues could be seen. ”

“Mother Xu said, “I’m going to ask you one last time. Are you coming back with us or not?” ”

“”Mom, Please Don’t Force Me!”Xu Yao cried out. ”

“”Xu Yao, you’re not coming back with us, right?”Mother Xu asked. ”

Xu Yao didn’t say anything. The expression on her face was very painful.

“Mother Xu continued, “Xu Yao, listen well! If you don’t go back with your father and me today, we won’t have a daughter like you in the future!” ”

“After saying that, mother Xu pulled father Xu and turned around to leave. ”

“Mom!”Xu Yao cried out.

Father Xu and mother Xu left without any mercy.

“The He family’s parents pulled Xu Yao. “Child, don’t be sad. You still have us in the future!” ”

Xu Yao hugged mother he. “Auntie!”

Mother he was also feeling quite uncomfortable.

“As a parent, she could understand how the Xu family’s parents were feeling. ”

“Even if he ziteng was fine, he could only be a vegetable. ”

Xu Yao could not be a vegetable for the rest of her life.

“If Xu Yao gave birth to the child, not only would it affect her reputation, it would also implicate her. ”

“To the current Xu Yao, the child was just a small burden. ”

“As a parent, when they saw Xu Yao like this, they would definitely reach out and give her a hand. ”

“Mother he patted Xu Yao’s back, “Yaoyao, don’t be sad and don’t hate your parents. They don’t have any ill intentions. They are doing this for your own good. After you give birth to the child, go and apologize to them. I think they will definitely forgive you.” ”

“Xu Yao’s lips curled up slightly, and a dark light flashed in her eyes. “Yes, thank you, Auntie.” ” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Mother he sighed. “I should be the one thanking you. Thank you for being willing to keep this poor child. It was Auntie who let you down previously.”

“She shouldn’t have been angry at Xu Yao, and she shouldn’t have let Xu Yao hit the wall. ”

It was her fault.

On the other side.

“After Xu family’s parents walked out of the hospital, their expressions immediately changed. ”

“Mother Xu smiled and looked at Father Xu. “How was it? My acting was pretty good, right?” ”

Father Xu gave her a thumbs up. “Amazing! Very amazing! I almost took it seriously!”

It had to be said that mother Xu’s move was simply too amazing!

“Not only did it dispel the he family’s parents’doubts about Xu Yao, it also allowed Xu Yao to keep the child and become a rare and good girl. ”

No wonder people said that one should marry a good wife.

“For the first time, father Xu felt that it was not wrong to marry mother Xu back then. ”

“If it was anyone else, would they have thought of such a method? ”

It was impossible!

“Thinking of the scene just now, the smile on mother Xu’s lips became even wider. She continued, “Did you hear what Ouyang Xunfang said just now? She said that our Yaoyao will be the he family’s daughter-in-law in the future!” ”

“Father Xu nodded and continued, “From now on, the He family will be our world!” ”

“”But we can’t be happy too early,”mother Xu continued, “We have to wait for Yaoyao to give birth to the child safely. By the way, do you think that he ziteng is really hopeless? What if he suddenly comes back to life?” ”

What if he ziteng suddenly comes back to life? Wouldn’t all of this be in vain!

The current situation was that he ziteng dying directly or becoming a vegetable would be more beneficial to Xu Yao!

Therefore.

He ziteng must not get better.

“”He won’t! Don’t Worry!”Father Xu said, “I’ve asked. He ziteng’s chief surgeon is the best doctor in China. He has several years of overseas study experience. He said that he ziteng is hopeless. Then he ziteng must be hopeless!” ”

“Hearing this, mother Xu heaved a sigh of relief and said with a smile, “That’s Good! Speaking of which, our Yaoyao is also lucky. Don’t you think that if our Yaoyao didn’t get pregnant this time, she would have been kicked out by the He Family?” ”

“In this way, Xu Yao’s efforts were in vain. ”

“Father Xu nodded and said with great agreement, “I also think that our Yaoyao is lucky! Even God is helping her!” ”

“After learning that he ziteng was in trouble, the CEN base’s employees all came over to see he ziteng. ”

The He family’s parents’eyes were red as they told everyone about he ziteng’s current situation and introduced Xu Yao.

“What Xu Yao needed the most right now was status. After all, she was pregnant with he ziteng’s child. ”

“When they heard that Xu Yao was pregnant with He Ziteng’s child and was determined not to have an abortion, everyone was full of admiration for Xu Yao. ”

“If it was anyone else, they probably wouldn’t be able to do what Xu Yao did. ”

“”Sister-in-law, don’t worry. Brother Ziteng is such a good person. He will definitely be fine!” ”

“”Sister-in-law, you have to be strong. You still have us in the future!” ”

“Xu Yao’s eyes were red as she said, “Thank you, everyone. I will definitely be strong and face life. No matter what Ziteng will become in the future, I will always be by Ziteng’s side and raise the child to become an adult!” ”

“After listening to these words, everyone was even more impressed with Xu Yao. ”

“”Sister-in-law, a good person will be rewarded. You and worker he are both so good. Worker he will definitely get better!” ”

“”Okay.”Xu Yao nodded and continued, “Thank you for coming to see ziteng. I thank you on his behalf.” ”

“”Sister-in-law, you’re too polite. He Gong has always been so good to us. It’s only right that we come to see him now.” ”

“Cen Jiang did not go to Mars. He called father he to the side and asked, “Uncle, have you looked for Miss Ye?” ”

“Although he ziteng’s injuries were very serious, ye Zhuo should have a solution. ”

“Father he nodded. “I have, but Miss Ye is doing an experiment now. Assistant Xiao Shen said that we can’t contact her now, so we can only wait for the experiment to end.” ”

“Cen Jiang frowned slightly and continued, “Uncle, don’t worry. Don’t worry. We’ll talk about everything after Miss Ye finishes her experiment.” ”

“Father he looked at Cen Jiang, his eyes rekindled with hope. “Team leader Cen, is Miss Ye’s medical skills really that good?” ”

“Yes.”Cen Jiang nodded.

“Cen Jiang was a very steady person. Hearing him say that, father he inexplicably gained a lot of confidence! ”

“Father he continued, “I hope Ziteng can survive tonight and wait for Miss Ye’s return safely.” ”

“Cen Jiang said, “He will definitely make it. I believe in ziteng.” ”

Father he nodded.

“Time passed by minute by minute. Very quickly, it was already eight o’clock in the evening. ”

“That night, the He family’s parents were all standing guard at the entrance of the ICU Ward, afraid that something would happen to he ziteng. ”

Xu Yao also pretended to be standing guard at the entrance.

“Mother Xu stood up and said, “Yaoyao, go back and rest first. Your uncle and I will be fine here.” ”

“Xu Yao shook her head. “No, I want to watch Ziteng Myself.” ”
