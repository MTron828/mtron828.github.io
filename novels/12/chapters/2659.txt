“Shaoqing is here.”

“Uncle and Auntie.”Cen Shaoqing greeted her rationally.

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “Why did you come here so late at night! You still have to go to work tomorrow! Hurry up and go back!””

“”It’s okay.”CEN Shaoqing said, “I’m here to accompany Zao Zao.””

“Although it was not ye Zao giving birth, at this time, a girl still needed someone to accompany her.”

“After all, giving birth was a very painful thing, whether it was an experiencer or a witness.”

“At this moment, Bai Jingshu, who was leaning against the bed, seemed to have thought of something and continued, “Zhuo Zhuo, have you decided on the name of the Child?””

“Ye Zhuo nodded slightly, “Yes.””

“What is it called?”Bai Jingshu asked with great anticipation.

“Ye Zhuo continued, “If it’s a girl, it can be called Lin Lu. If It’s a boy, it can be called Lin Xi.””

“Hearing this, Bai Jingshu immediately asked, “Is it the line in ‘Jian Jia’, ‘when the rain falls, the River Falls, Bai Lu Wei Xi’?””

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “That’s a good name. I like it.””

“Lin Ze said, “I also think that’s a good name.””

“Hearing this, Bai Jingshu was a little speechless and said, “Of course you think it’s a good name!”After saying this, she looked at ye Zao again. “Zao Zao, do you know what names your brother has chosen?””

“I don’t know.”Ye Zao shook his head slightly.

“Bai Jingshu continued, “What Lin Bao, Lin Xiaocui, Lin Guifen... I even suspect that he’s someone from the 1980s!””

“Ye Zao chuckled. “Actually, my brother’s names are quite unique.””

“”I don’t know if they’re unique or not. In any case, they’re quite down-to-earth, just like old people. Especially that Xiaocui and Guifen. I don’t even know how he came up with them!””

“Bai Jingshu was quite compatible with Lin Ze in other aspects, but when it came to naming, Bai Jingshu really couldn’t appreciate Lin Ze’s aesthetics.”

Lin Ze didn’t say anything. He just rubbed his nose.

“Actually, he thought that Guifen was a really nice name, but it was a pity that Bai Jingshu didn’t like it.”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Why are they all girls’names? Didn’t my brother choose a boy’s name?””

“”He gave them one too,”Bai Jingshu said.” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“What’s his name?”Ye Zao was very curious.

“Bai Jingshu continued, “Ask him yourself.””

“”Brother, what’s his name?”Ye Zao asked.”

“Lin Ze said, “Tiezhu.””

“”What?”For a moment, ye Zao thought he was hearing things.”

“Bai Jingshu said, “That’s right, Zao Zao. You heard right. He wants to name his biological son Lin Tiezhu.””

“This time, even ye Shu laughed out loud. She patted Lin Ze on the shoulder and said, “Oh my God, Ah Ze, how did you come up with that name?””

Ye searing also laughed. “Why don’t we use Tiezhu as a nickname?”

“”It doesn’t matter as long as the big name isn’t Tiezhu,”Bai Jingshu said.”

“Ye Shu smiled and continued, “A cheap name is easy to raise. Why don’t we listen to Aunt? Our nickname is Tiezhu.””

Lin Ze looked at Bai Jingshu. “Is that okay?”

This matter had to be approved by Bai Jingshu. Lin Ze didn’t dare to make the decision alone.

“Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “That’s fine. My son already has a great name.””

Lin Xi.

She liked this name very much.

“”How do you know it’s a son? What if it’s a Daughter?”Lin Ze couldn’t help but say, “I think Lin Lu sounds better.””

“”What do you know?”Bai Jingshu, who never swore, couldn’t help but swear.”

Lin Ze didn’t say anything.

The world was vast and pregnant women were the most powerful. Good men would never compete with pregnant women.

“Soon, the one-hour period of relaxation passed. Bai Jingshu’s facial features were twisted from the pain. Seeing her like this, Cen Shaoqing came to the ward. His forehead was covered with a thin layer of sweat.”

“He had never experienced this before, so he never knew that it was so painful for a woman to give birth.”

“Why are you here?”Ye Zao also came to the door.

“Cen Shaoqing put the Buddha beads into his pocket and held ye Zao’s hand. “Zao Zao, we won’t have children in the future.””

It was so painful to give birth. It was better not to have children.

“Why?”Ye Zao was stunned. “Didn’t you say that it was best to have 70 to 80 children?”

“”Because I suddenly don’t like children anymore,”Cen Shaoqing said.”

“”But I like children,”ye Zao said. “It’s best to have a son and a daughter, and then a cat and a dog. Only then can a life be considered complete.””

Cen Shaoqing was silent for a moment.

“At this moment, Bai Jingshu’s palace was fully opened, and the doctors and nurses removed her from the delivery room.”

“Ye Zao held onto Cen Shaoqing’s hand and said, “Let’s go too.””

“Although the delivery room was soundproof, the screams of the pregnant woman could still be heard.”

Lin Ze paced around the room.

“Lin Jincheng held onto ye Shu’s hand tightly. At this moment, he felt that he had let her down. Why was he not beside ye Shu when she gave birth.”

“Time passed by slowly. At this moment, the sound of a loud baby crying could be heard in the air.”
