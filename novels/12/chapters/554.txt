These words made Zhao shuning very flustered and confused. His breathing quickened.

“After saying this, Ye Zao turned his head slightly. “Father, mother, brother, let’s go back first.””

“Ye Shu and Lin Jincheng looked at each other. They could see the confusion in each other’s eyes, but they still nodded and followed ye Zao’s footsteps.”

“Walking out of the door, Lin Jincheng asked curiously, “Zao, what exactly is going on?””

“Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly. “Dad, do you think my name can be changed so easily?””

Lin Jincheng was stunned.

“Although he had not known ye Zao for long, he knew that his daughter was not as simple as she looked, even though she was only nineteen years old.”

“Ye Shu continued to ask, “So, your grandmother will really change your name back?””

“”Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “So, you don’t have to worry about this.””

“After saying this, Ye Zhuo looked at Lin Ze. “Brother, didn’t you say that you were going to visit uncle with me this afternoon?””

“Originally, Lin Jincheng had prepared ye Sen’s room in the Lin family manor, but Ye Sen wasn’t willing to come over and stay.”

He said that it wasn’t suitable for his brother-in-law to stay at his sister’s house.

“Therefore, Ye Sen was temporarily staying in the house that they had rented previously.”

“Lin ze nodded and asked, “Are we going now?””

“”Yes, we’re going now.””

“”Okay,”Lin ze continued, “I’ll go back to my room first and bring the things I bought for uncle.””

“I’ll go with you.”Ye Zhuo followed Lin Ze’s footsteps.

“Looking at the backs of the family of four leaving, Zhao shuning was so angry that her face turned white.”

How could she have thought that Lin Jincheng would attack the Zhao family for ye Zhuo?

Old Madam Lin was also very angry.

“At this moment, Zhao Shuning’s phone rang again.”

It was Zhao Shuqi calling.

“”Brother, don’t worry. We’ll go right away! Right away!””

“After hanging up, Zhao shuning grabbed old madam Lin’s wrist. “Mom, let’s go quickly!””

“Although Old Lady Lin was very angry, she knew that she had to put the big picture first. She quickly followed Zhao shuning to the public security bureau and Sighed. “Ever since ye Shu entered the office, Jin city has been missing me more and more!””

“If this was in the past, how would Lin Jin city dare to treat her like this?”

It was all ye Shu’s fault.

“If it weren’t for Ye Shu, Lin Jin city wouldn’t have become like this.”

“Soon, the car stopped at the entrance of the Public Security Bureau.”

“Sun Peiyuan had already received a notice from the higher-ups. When he saw Old Lady Lin and Zhao shining coming over, he quickly brought the two of them to go through the formalities.”

In less than ten minutes.

Ye Zhuo’s name was changed back.

“Looking at the name that was changed back, Old Lady Lin was extremely depressed. “Little Sun! As a grandmother, why can’t I change my own granddaughter’s name?””

“In Old Mrs. Lin’s opinion, ye Zhuo should have been surnamed Zhao.”

What right did that B * Tch ye Shu have to let her child have her surname?

“Sun Peiyuan was also terrified. He was very glad that when he changed his name back then, he had called Zhao Shuqi and consulted him. That was why he did not get himself into trouble.”

“Otherwise, Zhao Shuqi would not be the only one who was unlucky this time.”

He was afraid that he would also be unlucky.

“Sun Peiyuan wiped the cold sweat off his forehead. “Old Madam, your granddaughter, Miss Ye, is not an ordinary person. Unless she personally comes over, no one has the authority to change Miss Ye’s name.””

Not an ordinary person?

“Ye Zhuo could not even be compared to half of Feng Xianxian. If she was not an ordinary person, who else could she be?”

The only thing that was not ordinary about her was probably the Lin family’s eldest daughter.

If it wasn’t for the eldest daughter of the Lin family...

What was Ye Zhuo?

He was just a little sparrow from the countryside.

Old Lady Lin’s face was full of disdain. “Does she have to come in person? Can’t I come as a grandmother?”

“Yes.”Sun Peiyuan nodded. “Miss Ye has to come personally! Miss ye has to agree personally!”

Old Lady Lin furrowed her brows tightly.

“Zhao shuning was more worried about Zhao Shuqi now. “Little Sun, the name has been changed back. Will my brother be implicated?””

“Sun Peiyuan shook his head. “That’s hard to say. Why Don’t you go and take a look yourself?”At the moment, no one had been notified, and Sun Peiyuan didn’t know Zhao Shuqi’s specific situation.”

“However, according to how much importance the higher-ups placed on ye Zhuo, Zhao Shuqi probably didn’t have a good ending.”

“After all, he had asked Little Chu to change ye Zhuo’s name, and the higher-ups had discovered it.”

“Zhao shuning turned to look at Old Mrs. Lin. “Mom, you should go back first. I’ll go to my brother’s place to take a look!””
