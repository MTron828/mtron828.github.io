“”That’s great. Thank you, Miracle Doctor Ye!”Vivi was very excited. ”

“In an instant, even her spirit had improved a lot. ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Rest well tonight. Don’t stay up late. Remember to cooperate with the examination tomorrow.” ”

“Okay.”Vivi nodded.

Ye Zhuo turned to look at Doctor Wu. “Let’s go.”

“Okay.”Doctor Wu followed ye Zao’s footsteps.

“When they arrived outside the ward, doctor Wu continued, “Miss Ye, in Weiwei’s case, is there really no need to refrain from eating?” ”

“”There’s no need,”ye Zao said. ”

“Doctor Wu continued to ask, “Miss Ye, have you already diagnosed the cause of Weiwei’s illness?” ”

“We’ll wait for the results of the examination tomorrow.”

Doctor Wu was stunned.

“Before the cause of the illness was confirmed, ye Zao dared to make Weiwei eat such nonsense? ”

“Although he was very puzzled, Doctor Wu did not say it out loud. ”

“Ye Zao was, after all, Ye Zao. ”

“With her curing cancer and creating a miracle in the history of medicine, it could prove her ability. ”

“Since she said so, there was definitely no problem. ”

“Ye Zao continued, “When the results are out, send me your wechat.” ”

“Okay.”Doctor Wu nodded.

“At this moment, ye Zao seemed to have realized something and continued, “Let’s add each other on wechat.” ”

Doctor Wu was about to remind ye Zao and the others that they did not add each other on wechat when ye Zao spoke up.

“Doctor Wu immediately opened wechat and scanned through it, adding ye Zao as a friend. ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Doctor Wu, you can go back to your work first. If you have any questions, look for me on wechat.” ”

“Okay.”Doctor Wu nodded.

“After ye Zhuo left, doctor Wu quickly went to the director’s office. ”

“The director asked, “How is it? Have you found out about Miss Ye?” ”

“”Not yet, but I see that miss ye seems to be very confident. She even gave me a list.”After saying that, doctor Wu handed the list to the director. ”

Director Han took it and looked at it carefully.

“After a while, he put down the list and said, “Follow Miss Ye’s instructions.” ” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Although these tests might not be useful, ye Zao must have his own reasons for arranging them. ”

“Okay.”Doctor Wu nodded.

“Soon, ye Zao arrived at the waiting area. ”

Bai Jingshu’s test report was already out.

Lin Ze accompanied Bai Jingshu inside to talk to the Doctor while Lin Jincheng and ye Shu waited outside.

“Ye Zao walked over. “Dad, Mom, how is it?” ”

“Ye Shu said, “I don’t know yet! Your brother and sister-in-law are inside talking to the Doctor!” ”

Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“”Zao Zao, Jingshu is definitely pregnant, right?”Ye Shu asked somewhat uncertainly. ”

“”Really!”Ye Zao smiled. “Mom, don’t you believe in my medical skills?” ”

Ye Shu looked anxiously into the room. “Why aren’t they out yet?”

“”They should be out soon. Don’t worry,”ye Zao said. ”

“As soon as he said this, Lin Ze and Bai Jingshu walked out. ”

“Ye Shu immediately went up to them. “Ah Ze, Jingshu, how are you?” ”

Lin Ze nodded. “Burning is right. Jingshu is indeed five weeks pregnant.”

“That’s Great!”Ye Shu was very excited.

“When she looked at the person in question again, Bai Jingshu actually didn’t get excited anymore. She smiled and said, “Mom, the Doctor said that my fetus looks very good. I want to go back soon and tell my grandfather about this good news.” ”

“”You should go back and see the old man,”ye Shu said. “When do you plan to go back?” ”

“Bai Jingshu said, “If Ah Ze has time, I want to go back as soon as possible.” ”

The only wish of the old man now was to see her give birth to a child.

“Lin Ze said, “I’m not busy recently. How about going back the day after tomorrow?” ”
