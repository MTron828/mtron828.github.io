“Okay.”The assistant nodded.

Doctor Liu didn’t know what to say. It was Chen Siyao’s freedom to like whoever she wanted. He just sighed. “Infatuation has always been in vain!”

“The assistant seemed to be moved as well. He nodded and said, “Yeah.” ”

This was how the world was.

It was impossible for everyone to be with the person they liked.

“There was always regret, but there was also sadness. ”

“Doctor Liu turned to look at his assistant and asked, “Then how is Miss Chen’s situation now?” ”

This sentence was more or less probing.

“He wanted to know if Chen Siyao was really on a hunger strike, or if she was just trying to scare song Shiyu. ”

“The assistant said, “The situation is very bad.” ”

“After that, the assistant added, “I have a feeling that Miss Chen will be very sad this time.” ”

Doctor Liu frowned slightly. “Is it that serious?” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Yes.”The assistant nodded.

“Doctor Liu continued to ask, “What about boss song? How did Boss Song React?” ”

“Old Master Chen owed song Shiyu a favor. Now that Chen Siyao was in trouble, it was still because of him. Logically speaking, song Shiyu shouldn’t have ignored him. ”

“”There was no reaction from third master,”the assistant replied. ”

“You didn’t inform Boss Song?”Dr. Liu asked.

“The assistant continued, “I’m not too sure about the specifics.” ”

“After all, it was a matter of her superior. It wasn’t good for her to say too much. ”

Dr. Liu didn’t ask any more questions.

“Soon, the car arrived. ”

“The assistant took Dr. Liu’s medical kit. “Dr. Liu, over here.” ”

“Okay.”Dr. Liu followed the assistant’s footsteps.

The two of them walked into the room together.

“Chen Siyao’s room was on the top floor, so the view was very good. ”

“However, today, the room, which was originally very spacious, lost its usual splendor. ”

The city gates were endless.

The few plants placed on the balcony drooped their heads listlessly.

Everything was so sad.

“”Miss, doctor Liu is here,”the assistant said. ”

“Chen Siyao, who was lying on the bed, was pale. When she heard the sound, she moved and turned to look at the door. Her voice was very low and weak. “I told you, I don’t want to see a doctor!” ”

“Hearing this, doctor Liu immediately walked forward. “Miss Chen, you only have one life. You must not joke about your own life.” ”

Chen Siyao didn’t say anything.

Doctor Liu walked to the bedside and observed Chen Siyao’s complexion before reaching out to check her pulse.

“He thought that Chen Siyao was just trying to scare song Shiyu, but he didn’t expect Chen Siyao’s pulse to be so weak. ”

“She, she was really seeking death! ”

“Doctor Liu immediately let go of Chen Siyao’s wrist and continued, “Miss Chen, your condition is very dangerous now. You have to inject the nutrient solution immediately! Otherwise, you won’t be able to keep your life!” ”

“”Doctor Liu, thank you for your kindness.”Chen Siyao looked at doctor Liu without any light in her eyes. She was like a blind person, extremely gloomy, “But it’s so tiring to live. I can’t live with the person I like, and I can’t do the things I like. It’s better to die in peace.”Chen Siyao’s words were half true, half false. ”

“For a moment, it was hard to tell whether it was true or false. ”

“Doctor Liu looked at Chen siyao and continued, “Miss Chen, there’s nothing in life that you can’t get over. There’s more than one tree in the world. Why do you have to give up the entire forest for one tree?” ”

“Chen Siyao smiled. “Doctor Liu, is there anyone you like?” ”

“”I’m already married,”doctor Liu said. ”

“”No Wonder,”Chen Siyao continued, “You walked into marriage with the person you like. Naturally, you don’t understand my behavior.” ”

“At this point, two tears trickled down from the corners of Chen Siyao’s eyes. “Why is it so hard for me to walk into marriage with the person I like?” ”

Why is it so hard!

“Dr. Liu continued, “Miss Chen, you can only walk into marriage if you like each other. The world is very big. It’s impossible for a person to only love one person in their lifetime. Perhaps the person who truly makes you love and loves you has yet to appear! “So, you must not give up. You only have one life.” ”

“At this point, doctor Liu added, “Miss Chen, you were born with a body of gold. You Don’t have to struggle for life. I wonder how many people envy you. Why do you have to be trapped in your own world and not come out?” ”

“Not only was Chen Siyao born well, but she was also quite good-looking. She was born fair, rich, and beautiful. She didn’t have to worry about her life. She could apply the most expensive facial mask, live in the most luxurious villa, and wear the most beautiful clothes, she didn’t know how many people dreamed of living her life, but Chen Siyao couldn’t see it. ”
