I remember.

“Of course, Zhou Xiang remembered. ”

“In order to marry Cen Haifeng, Xie Ying had used all kinds of means? ”

“”But that’s in the past,”Zhou Xiang continued, “The dead are the most important. After all, Xie Ying has been gone for so many years. “It’s said that a disaster shouldn’t be small. I Can’t make things difficult for Wan Yin just because of Xie Ying’s matter. We can’t be like this.” ”

“No matter what happened between adults, it had nothing to do with the child. ”

Zheng Wanyin had not been there when those things happened.

“Therefore, she could not blame Zheng Wanyin. ”

“Zhou jinbei said, “What root hair, what seedling. In my opinion, that Zheng Wanyin is not a good person either!” ”

“”Jinbei!”Zhou Xiang continued, “You can not like Wanyin, but you can’t say that about wanyin! A Girl’s reputation is the most important thing. If even your uncle talks about her like that, how will outsiders see her? If this word gets out, how will it sound good?” ”

Zhou Jinbei shook his head helplessly.

“After thinking for a while, Zhou Xiang stood up from her chair and said, “Wait for me here for a while. I’m going upstairs to get something.” ”

“Okay.”

“Zhou Xiang went to the bedroom and rummaged through the cabinets. Finally, she found a huge green diamond. ”

This green diamond was a rare diamond that Zhou Jinbei had obtained when he first went to South Africa to contact the diamond business.

It was priceless.

“After finding the Green Diamond, Zhou Xiang went downstairs. “Jinbei, this is for you.” ”

“Looking at the diamond in front of him, Zhou Jinbei was stunned. “SIS, what do you mean by this?” ”

“Zhou Xiang explained, “You can go to see your parents. You Can’t go empty-handed and give this green diamond belt to Wanyin. Just say that you gave it to her. Don’t be silly and say that I asked you to give it to her.” ”

“What?”Zhou Jinbei was stunned for a moment.

“Zhou xiang continued, “Give this green diamond to Wanyin! Our parents like Wanyin so much. They will definitely be very happy to see you give such a precious green diamond to Wanyin.”Zhou Zuolong and Xie Wanqiu liked to compare, zhou Jinbei either did not make a move, or if he did, he had to give a good one. ”

The comparison between a green diamond and a pink diamond could be said to be on par.

“At that time, Zhou Zuolong and Xie Wanqiu would have nothing to say. ”

Zhou Jinbei did not like Zheng Wanyin. It was almost impossible for Zhou Jinbei to give Zheng Wanyin something on his own.

“Therefore, Zhou Xiang could only bear to part with it. ”

“Although she also liked the green diamond very much, she was willing to give it to Zheng Wanyin for the sake of the harmony of the family. ”

“As long as it could create a barrier between father and son, Zhou Xiang was willing to do anything for Zhou Xiang. ”

“”SIS, you’re confused!”Zhou Jinbei frowned slightly. “How could you give such a precious thing to Zheng Wanyin!” ”

Did Zheng Wanyin deserve it?

“Not to mention such a precious green diamond, even if it was just a grain of rice, Zhou Jinbei did not want to let Zheng wanyin have it. ”

“Zhou xiang smiled and said, “No matter how good the thing is, it’s still a dead thing, but a person is alive. “Moreover, Wanyin is not an outsider! “Jinbei, listen to me. Take this and give it to wanyin. Only in this way can we repair the relationship between you and your parents.” ”

Zhou Jinbei took a deep breath and tried his best to calm himself down.

“Zhou Xiang was his only sister. She had been so good to him when he was young. If it weren’t for Zhou Xiang, he wouldn’t be where he is now. Therefore, he couldn’t lose his temper at Zhou Xiang. ”

He had to control himself.

“”Sister, before Mom’s will is repaired, Zhou Zuolong and Xie Wanqiu can’t be rid of the suspicion of murder,”zhou jinbei continued, “So, before that, I won’t go to the hospital to see them.” ”

“Zhou Xiang had no choice since Zhou Jinbei was like this. She continued, “You said last time that the will will be restored in a week?” ”

“Yes.”Zhou Jinbei nodded.

“Zhou Xiang continued, “Alright, then we’ll wait for another five days. After five days, when the will is restored, you’ll have to go see dad, right?” ”

Zhou Jinbei didn’t say anything.

Because he never thought that Wu Lan’s death had nothing to do with Zhou Zuolong.

“Zhou Xiang said again, “Zuolong, father doesn’t like to joke. He said in front of me today that if you don’t go to the hospital to see them, he will cut off his father-son relationship with you! “The will will only come out five days later. Can’t you go see him in advance?” ”

“”Let him be,”Zhou Jinbei said. ”

“Zhou Xiang sighed. “Zuolong, why are you so stubborn! ”

“Once Zhou Zuolong really broke off his relationship with Zhou Jinbei, the relationship between them would never be able to be restored. ”

“After the will was restored, it proved that Zhou Zuolong had nothing to do with Wu Lan’s death. At that time, no matter how Zhou Jinbei apologized to Zhou Zuolong to make up for it, it would be useless! ”

Zhou Xiang did not want to see this matter.

She did not want to see Wu Lan’s cold heart underground.

Zhou Jinbei did not say anything.

“Zhou xiang continued, “Jinbei, just take it that I’m begging you, okay? It’s said that a child wants to be raised but not to be kept close. A tree wants to be quiet but the wind will not stop. I don’t want to see you do something that you’ll regret.” ”

“”Sis, don’t worry. I Won’t regret it.”Zhou Jinbei’s face was full of determination. ” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Zhou jinbei continued, “Sis, I still have something to do. I’ll leave first.” ”

“After saying that, Zhou Jinbei turned around and left. ”

Zhou Xiang stood up anxiously. “Jinbei!”

Zhou Jinbei did not even turn his head back.

“Looking at Zhou Jinbei’s back, Zhou Xiang sighed. ”

Zhou Jinbei had just walked out of the door when he saw Old Madam Cen standing there waiting for him.

“Old Madam.”

“Brother-in-law.”Zhou Jinbei smiled as he went up to greet her.

“Old madam CEN continued, “Brother-in-law, I know you’re a sensible person, so I have a few words to say to you. Is it convenient for you?” ”

“”It’s convenient.”Zhou Jinbei nodded. “Old Mrs. Cen, if you have anything to say, just say it.” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Then let’s talk as we walk. It just so happens that the weather is cold. Let’s treat it as exercise.” ”

“Okay.”Zhou Jinbei nodded.

The two of them talked as they walked.

“Old Mrs. Cen said, “Brother-in-law, is everything okay at home?” ”

“It’s fine.”

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Brother-in-law, actually, I called you over from Haicheng this time because of Xiangxiang. Xiangxiang is your biological sister. You know that child’s character. She’s too soft. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have been bullied by your stepmother for so many years!” ”

“”To tell you the truth, I’m actually worried about this matter too.”Zhou jinbei continued, “But searing fire is going to fix the will soon. As long as she fixes the will, I believe that my sister will be able to see the reality clearly.”Although Zhou Xiang’s character was a little soft.., she was not muddle-headed. ”

“”That’s good.”Old Mrs. Cen looked into the distance, “But I am just a little worried. What if your mother did not say anything in the will? Brother-in-law, we are not afraid of anything. What if your mother’s will did not mention this matter? What would you do?” ”

“Hearing this, Zhou Jinbei was stunned. ”

“To be honest, he had never thought about this. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Brother-in-law, Xiang Xiang went to the hospital, right?” ”

“Yes.”Zhou Jinbei did not hide it.

“Old Mrs. Cen said, “I saw her frowning. They must have made things difficult for her again, right? Can you tell me what it is about?” ”

“Zhou jinbei continued, “It should be about my matter. Zhou Zuolong wants me to go to the hospital to see them... ... and they don’t know where to find out about my pink diamond. My sister wants me to give her one too . . ...” ”

“After listening to the story, the CEN old lady frowned: “This is too shameless! They can say such words! I have never seen such a shameless person!” ”

Zhou Jinbei agreed with the old lady.

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Brother-in-law, I’m telling you, don’t listen to Xiang Xiang’s nonsense! Who is Zheng Wanyin? What right does she have for you to give her diamonds?” ”

“I know.”Zhou Jinbei nodded.

“Old Mrs. Cen smiled and said, “If Xiang Xiang was half as good as you, I wouldn’t have to worry so much.” ”

“Zhou Jinbei said, “Old Mrs. Cen, actually my sister is a little soft-hearted. She’s a good person!” ”

“”I know,”old madam CEN continued, “If it wasn’t for the fact that she’s a nice person from Xiang, I would have turned against her long ago!” ”

“Zhou jinbei smiled and said, “My sister is lucky to have a mother-in-law like you.” ”

At the hospital.

“Zheng Wanyin poured Zhou zuolong a glass of water. “Grandfather, you’ve said it so harshly. What if Uncle Doesn’t come tomorrow? Do you really want to sever ties with him?” ”

“Zhou zuolong said angrily, “Not only do I want to sever ties with him, I also want to publish it in the newspapers! Let his reputation spread far and wide!” ”

“Zheng wanyin said, “Grandfather, isn’t this a little bad? You and uncle are father and son after all.” ”
