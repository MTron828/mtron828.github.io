Translator: 549690339

“”Really?”Upon hearing this, Zheng Wanyin said excitedly, “My uncle is really here! Cousin, did you see wrongly?” ”

“Xie Rong Lexi smiled and said, “Don’t worry, I didn’t see wrongly.” ”

“In order to make a mistake, xie wanqiu said, “I’ll go out and take a look.” ”

“Zhou Zuolong stood out and said, “Wanqiu, rest well. I’ll go and take a look.”He was afraid that Xie Wanqiu was too kind, so after seeing Zhou Jinbei, he directly brought Zhou Jinbei to the ward. ”

Zhou Zuolong was not prepared to forgive Zhou Jinbei so easily.

“Xie wanqiu nodded and said worriedly, “Old man, don’t make things too difficult for the child.” ”

“Zhou Zuolong did not say anything. He turned to look at Xie rongle and said, “RONGLE, where did you see that unfilial son?” ”

“Xie rongle said, “In the hall on the first floor of the hospital.” ”

“Got it.”Zhou Zuolong nodded and turned to walk out of the door.

Zhou Zuolong had just arrived at the lobby on the first floor when he saw Zhou Jinbei’s figure.

Xie Rongle was right.

It was Zhou Jinbei!

“After confirming that the person was Zhou Jinbei, Zhou Zuolong immediately returned to the ward and said angrily, “Go and block the door for me! Without me, no one is allowed to open the door for that unfilial son today!” ”

“”Old Man, since the child has come to admit his mistake, don’t make things difficult for him!”Xie wanqiu looked at Zhou Zuolong. ”

“Zhou zuolong said, “Make things difficult for him? If he didn’t make things difficult for me, would I make things difficult for him?”In this world, how many parents were willing to make things difficult for their child? ”

“Clearly, Zhou Jinbei had gone too far! ”

“Hearing this, Xie wanqiu sighed. ”

“Zhou Zuolong turned to look at Zheng Wanyin. “Yinyin, go and close the door for me.” ”

Zheng Wanyin could only do as he said.

Zhou Zuolong moved a stool and sat in front of the door.

“If Zhou Jinbei wanted to enter the door today,. ”

He would have to go through him.

But...

“A minute passed, ten minutes passed, half an hour passed, and an hour passed. There was no movement outside the door. ”

What was going on?

Zhou Zuolong could not sit still.

“Logically speaking, Zhou Jinbei should have come a long time ago. ”

Why was there still no movement at all?

Even Xie Wanqiu felt that something was not right.

Could it be...

Zhou Jinbei did not intend to come and apologize?

“It was not until two hours had passed and Zhou Jinbei did not appear outside the door that Zhou Zuolong stood up from his chair and turned to look at Zheng Wanyin. “Yinyin, go outside and ask around. What exactly is going on?” ”

Zheng Wanyin nodded. “Alright.”

“Very soon, Zheng Wanyin returned. ”

“Xie wanqiu hurriedly asked, “Yinyin, what’s going on? Where’s your uncle?” ”

Zheng Wanyin looked a little troubled. “I went down to ask. It doesn’t seem like uncle is here to visit Grandpa.”

“Then why is he here?”Zhou Zuolong’s eyes were filled with anger.

“Zheng wanyin said, “He... he came here for a checkup.” ”

“Zhou Zuolong was so angry that he slammed the table and stood up. “Unfilial son! This unfilial son!”Zhou Jinbei did it on purpose! He came here on purpose to anger him! Zhou Jinbei clearly knew that he and Xie Wanqiu lived here, but he deliberately came to the hospital and did not come to see them! ”

“”Old man, calm down.”Xie wanqiu hurriedly said, “Jinbei is a good child. I believe that he definitely did not do it on purpose! The reason why he did not come to see us is definitely because he does not know that we are staying in the hospital!” ”

“Didn’t you see him? Is He Blind? Even Rong le saw him. How can he not see me?”

“Since Zhou Jinbei didn’t care about the relationship between father and son, then don’t blame him for being rude. ”

“Just wait. This time, he must make Zhou Jinbei pay the price! ”

“Zhou Zuolong took out his cell phone and made a call. “Hello, reporter Zhu...” ”

“At the same time, the matter of Zhou Jinbei not supporting the elderly and not showing filial piety to his parents became more and more heated on the Internet. ”

There were curses all over the place.

[ did Zhou Jinbei receive his retribution today? ]

“[ powerful netizens, all sorts of small gifts can be arranged. Remember to send more gifts to Zhou Jinbei, this ‘great filial son’! ] ”

“[ the more I think about it, the angrier I get. How can there still be such a disgusting person like Zhou Jinbei in this world? ] ”

“Just as the situation was getting more and more heated, Zhou Zuolong spoke again and appeared in front of the camera with tears streaming down his face, “Hello Everyone, I’m Zhou Jinbei’s father, Zhou Zuolong. “I didn’t expect this matter to cause such a huge uproar on the internet. No matter what, Zhou Jinbei is my son, my only son. As a parent, the last thing I want is for my own child to suffer. “I beg everyone not to scold Jinbei on the Internet. Actually, it hasn’t been easy for Jinbei all these years. Although he didn’t support us, his mother and I don’t blame him. “...” ”

“In that manner, he was clearly a good father. ”

“Zhou Zuolong was taking the initiative to advance while retreating. It seemed like he was speaking up for Zhou Jinbei, but in fact, he was adding fuel to the fire, completely igniting the anger in the hearts of the netizens. ”

“After seeing Zhou Zuolong’s words, the netizens became even angrier. ”

“[ father is a good father. Even at this time, he is still speaking up for Zhou Jinbei. Unfortunately, good people don’t get rewarded well. Old Mister Zhou didn’t meet a good son. ] ”

“”Old Mister Zhou is not afraid. From now on, we are all your sons! Zhou Jinbei did not raise you, we will raise you. No matter what, we will let the unfilial son get his retribution!” ”

“”Father Zhou, all of us are your strong backing.” ”

“”Respecting the old and caring for the young. Taking care of the elderly is a beautiful tradition in China. However, this big shot who touched China did not take care of the elderly! This is simply unforgivable by the heavens!” ”

“”Karma is the reincarnation of bad karma. Just wait and see, Old Mister Zhou’s present is Zhou Jinbei’s tomorrow. Sooner or later, Zhou Jinbei will end up with the fate of being abandoned by his family.” ”

“Zhou Jinbei can go to hell!” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Zheng wanyin browsed through the comments of the netizens, the corners of her mouth curling into a faint smile. ”

Although Zhou Jinbei did not come over today to apologize to Zhou Zuolong

But Zhou Zuolong would not be able to hold on for more than a few days!

“If this continued to develop, in less than half a month, the Zhou Group would declare bankruptcy. ”

“Taking advantage of this wave of popularity, Zhou Zuolong successfully opened his Weibo. ”

“In just a few hours, he had gained eight million followers. ”

This was faster than the average small internet celebrity gaining followers.

“With fans, he could eat. Even without Zhou Jinbei’s alimony, he could still make money from these fans. ”

At the same time.

Old Zhang and Dr. William also found out about Zhou Jinbei.

Dr. William looked at Old Zhang. “Has Zhou Jinbei contacted you in the past few days?”

Old Zhang shook his head. “Not yet.”

“After saying that, old Zhang continued, “Dr. William, do you think that Zhou Jinbei has really found someone who can repair the will?” ”

“”Impossible!”Dr. William said, “In China, those who have the ability to repair the will have yet to be born!” ”

“Other than him, there was no one else who could repair a will. ”

“After saying that, Dr. William continued, “Pay attention to your phone during this period of time. If Zhou Jinbei wants to make a comeback, he has to rely on that will.”If Zhou Jinbei wanted to repair his medical skills, he had to come and beg him! ”

“Got it.”Old Zhang nodded.

“William waved his hand. “Alright, you can leave now.” ”

On the other side.

“Zhou Xiang had been trying to find out which hospital Xie Wanqiu had been transferred to. Unfortunately, after a long time, she still couldn’t find anything. ”

Zhou Xiang was very anxious.

“According to the housekeeper’s efficiency, she shouldn’t have been unable to find anything for such a long time. ”

“”Housekeeper, what exactly is going on?”Zhou Xiang asked. ”

“The housekeeper looked at Zhou Xiang, his face full of embarrassment. “Madam, I’ll tell you the truth. It was old madam who told me not to tell you the hospital’s address!” ”

Old Madam Cen?

Zhou Xiang frowned and turned to walk into the house.

Old Madam Cen was sitting in the living room eating melon seeds.

“Zhou Xiang walked over directly. “Mom, why did you do that?” ”

“What About Me?”Old Madam Cen had a puzzled look on her face.

“Zhou xiang continued, “My parents have been transferred to another hospital. Why didn’t you ask the housekeeper to tell me the transfer address?” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen smiled and said, “Oh, so that’s what you’re talking about! Xiang Xiang, I didn’t ask the butler to tell you the address because it’s for your own good. With parents like you, it’s best to cut ties as soon as possible!” ”

“Mom!”

“Old Mrs. Cen waved her hand. “Don’t say anymore. Even if you break the sky today, I won’t say anything to you.” ”

“Zhou Xiang immediately knelt on the ground. “Mom, I Beg You!” ”

“Old Madam Cen turned her head away, not looking at Zhou Xiang. ”

“At the same time, upstairs. ”

Zhou Jinbei watched helplessly as the shares of the Zhou group fell lower and Lower Day by day. He was also extremely worried.

“At this moment, his phone rang in the air. ”

Zhou Jinbei picked up the phone and swiped it to answer. “Hello.”

“Uncle.”A clear and shallow voice came from the other end of the screen.

“Zhou Jinbei’s eyes lit up, as if a drowning man had grabbed a piece of driftwood. “Sear Sear! has that letter been restored?” ”

“”Yes.”Ye sear continued, “Where Are you now? I’ll send it over.” ”
