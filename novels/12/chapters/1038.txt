Zhao Xueyin subconsciously felt that ye Shu was not simple.

“If ye Shu was simple, would she be able to climb up to the Lin family head? ”

“The Lin family was a high-class family in the capital. At that time, Ye Shu was just a country bumpkin. ”

“Si lui continued, “This matter is rather complicated. Back then, when the Lin family head and ye Shu were together, Old Lady Lin strongly opposed it! “The patriarch of the Lin family even had a very serious car accident, causing him to lose his memory for more than ten years. Ye Shu was only promoted by the Lin family last year. Before that, she had been living in Yun Jing.” ”

“Only promoted last year?”Zhao Xueyin narrowed her eyes. She felt that ye Shu was not a simple person.

“A woman who grew up in the countryside and did not receive a good education was able to make the patriarch of the Lin family, who had lost his memory, dream about her for so many years. What kind of charm did she have? ”

“Zhao Xueyin continued, “Does ye Shu have children with the Master of the Lin Family?” ”

Si lui investigated all these things clearly. “Ye Shu and the Master of the Lin family have a pair of twins. They are 20 years old and are currently studying at Beijing University. The boy’s name is Lin Ze and the girl’s name is Ye Zao.”

“”The two siblings have the same surname, Lin and Ye?”Zhao Xueyin asked. ”

“Si lui nodded. “Yes. Back then, Ye Shu and the head of the Lin family were separated and the boy, Lin Ze, was taken away by Old Lady Lin. Ye Zao has been living with Ye Shu, so ye Zao has been following ye Shu’s surname.” ”

Zhao Xueyin pondered for a moment. “Do you have information on Ye Zao and Lin Ze?”

“To Zhao Xueyin, Ye Shu and her children were her most powerful enemies. ”

Knowing Yourself and your enemy would win every battle.

She had to find out all the details about these three people.

“”If you want to take a look, I’ll get someone to investigate right away,”the lawyer said. ”

“Zhao Xueyin raised her head and looked at the lawyer. “Big Brother Si, I’ll have to Trouble You Then.” ”

“Of course.”

Zhao Xueyin looked at the back of the lawyer and narrowed her eyes slightly.

It was not easy for the Zhao family to get to where they were today in the financial world. They were about to become the real owner of the Shunxi Financial Group and become an aristocratic family. They could not afford to have any trouble at this time.

“Hopefully, Ye Shu and her children were mediocre and would not be a stumbling block on the Zhao family’s path to becoming an aristocratic family. ”

“At this moment, a crisp phone ringtone sounded in the air. ”

“Zhao Xueyin picked up the phone. “Hello, Dad.” ”

“No one knew what was said on the other end of the phone, but Zhao Xueyin continued, “Don’t worry, everything will be discussed when I return.” ”

...

The news that Xi Empire officially changed its name to ye group swept through the entire capital overnight.

Ye Langhua seemed to have become the swift and decisive ye Langhua from back then!

“Xi Muwen had used underhanded methods to get to the top, and now that Xi Empire had finally fallen, many people applauded. ”

All the major financial newspapers started to publish.

“Ye Langhua stood on the top floor of the Ye Corporation, overlooking the scenery below. ”

“If this scene had happened thirty-six years ago, how great would it have been. ”

She and Ye Shu would not have been separated for so many years.

It was all her fault for waking up too late!

Ye Langhua closed her eyes. She could not describe the feeling in her heart.

“”Chairman.”At this moment, the secretary walked in from outside the door. ”

“Speak.”Ye Langhua turned around. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“The secretary continued, “Mr. Zhang wants to see you.” ”

“”Please come in quickly,”ye Langhua quickly said. ”

“Okay.”The secretary nodded and walked out the door.

“In a moment, elder Zhang walked in from outside. “Langhua.” ”

“”Elder Zhang.”Ye langhua continued, “Please take a seat.” ”

She was able to recognize XI Muwen’s true face because of elder Zhang.

“If elder Zhang had not found ye Zhuo, then she would still be in the dark. ”

“Thinking about her previous actions, ye Langhua felt very ashamed. ”

“Elder Zhang sat down on the chair and looked at Ye Langhua. “Now that everything has been settled, do you want to consider returning to the consortium?” ”

“Ye Langhua reached out and brushed the hair on the side of her face to the back of her head, “To be honest, I don’t want to see my father’s life’s work go down the drain just like that. But right now, my heart is willing, but my strength is insufficient. As you can see, even managing the ye group right now is difficult for me.” ”

Although there were three founders of the Shunxi Consortium.

The main force was still grandfather Ye.

“However, after Old Man Ye’s accident, the Shunxi Financial Group was dominated by the Zhao family. Currently, Zhao Xueyin was still competing for the position of the chief of the Financial Group. She wanted to completely remove the Ye and Zhang families from the Financial Group and let the Zhao family rise to become an aristocratic family in the financial world. ”
