Translator: 549690339

Wang Dajun had really become Wei Wei’s attending physician.

Who had signed Wei Wei’s surgery list?

“After all, Wei Wei had refused to sign it this morning. ”

Could it be Wei Wei’s parents?

“Thinking of this, nurse song frowned and immediately took the surgery list to Ye Zhuo’s office. “Miss Ye! Miss Ye!” ”

Ye Zao looked up slightly. “What’s wrong with Xiao Song?”

“Nurse song handed the surgery list to Ye Zao. “Miss Ye, look at this.” ”

Ye Zao reached out to take it and frowned slightly. “Nonsense!”

“A moment later, ye Zao reached out to press his temple and said, “Go and call doctor Wang over.” ”

“Okay.”Nurse song nodded and turned around to call Wang Dajun.

“But Wang Dajun was not willing to come over, “If Miss Ye wants me to go over because of Weiwei’s surgery, then I don’t need to go over. I must carry out the surgery tomorrow. If Miss Ye is not convinced, you can make Weiwei choose to believe in her!” ”

The person Weiwei believed in now was him!

“At this point, doctor Wang continued, “Just wait. After Tomorrow, Miss Ye will thank me.” ”

He was the one who saved ye Zhuo.

“If he had not discovered that Weiwei’s condition was not right in time, Weiwei would have already died on ye Zhuo’s operating table. ”

“Nurse song looked at Wang Dajun. “Doctor Wang, you should go over.” ”

“”I’m very busy,”Wang Dajun said. ”

“After saying that, Wang Dajun turned around and left. ”

Nurse song looked at Wang Dajun’s back view with a helpless expression on her face.

“On the other hand, Wang Dajun announced the news to the media as soon as he went out. ”

“Thank you for the patient and the patient’s family’s trust. They have already signed the consent form. The surgery will be scheduled for tomorrow at 9 am.”

“...”

“After nurse song returned, she immediately reported the situation to Ye Zhuo. ”

“Hearing this, ye Zhuo continued, “Go and call director Han.” ”

“Okay.”Nurse song nodded.

“Soon, director Han arrived. ”

“Looking at Ye Zao, director Han expressed his deepest apologies. Everything that had happened now was not within his control. ”

“Ye Zao raised his hand slightly and interrupted director Han’s apology, he continued, “Doctor Wang arranged for the surgery to be at nine o’clock tomorrow morning. I looked at the surgery list. Halfway through the surgery, there will definitely be a drop in heart rate and non-stop bleeding...” ”

“Director Han nodded repeatedly. “Don’t worry, Miss Ye. I know what to do.” ”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“After director Han left, Ye Zhuo went to Weiwei’s ward. ”

“To his surprise, Ye Zhuo actually saw a very warm scene. ”

A middle-aged woman sat by the bed and fed Weiwei spoon by spoon. Weiwei’s face was full of a happy smile. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Sister Ye!”

“Seeing ye Zhuo, Vivi took the initiative to greet him. ”

“Ye Zhuo walked over and asked, “Vivi, have you agreed to Dr. Wang’s surgery?” ”

“Vivi’s heart was already dead, but at this moment, she had regained the fatherly love that she had not seen for a long time. This made her want to give it a try. ”

What if she survived?

“Yes.”Vivi nodded.

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Wei Wei, you can’t enter the operating table tomorrow.” ”

“Why?”Wei Wei asked.

“”Because doctor Wang didn’t even diagnose the most basic cause of the illness correctly,”ye Zhuo continued, “To give a simple example, a small tree is on the verge of drowning due to the continuous rain. At this time, we should think of a way to drain the water in the basin instead of watering the small tree. If we continue to water it, the small tree can only drown.” ”

“Hearing this, Liu Meilian felt that something was wrong. She stood up and said, “You must be that Miss Ye! Can you please leave immediately? We don’t need you to tell us what to do!” ”

“Mom!”Wei Wei immediately stopped her mother.

“Liu Meilian said, “Doctor Wang said that you must not believe this woman’s words. She will kill you!” ”
