He ziteng nodded. “How old is Miss Xu Now?”

“”Third year,”Xu Xiao replied. ”

“He ziteng said, “Then we really have to treasure it.” ”

“The two of them ate and talked. Unknowingly, more than half an hour had passed. ”

“After eating, Xu Xiao stood up and said, “Mr. He, I’m done eating. I’ll be leaving first.” ”

“He ziteng nodded. Looking at Xu Xiao’s back, he felt that Xu Xiao was very different from other girls. ”

“As a noble, no matter where he went, he ziteng had no lack of suitors by his side. ”

“However, Xu Xiao’s behavior was polite and restrained. ” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

He ziteng appreciated her very much.

“For a moment, he felt that he had met the right woman! ”

“After sitting in the shop for a while, he ziteng turned around and left. ”

“When he returned to the He family’s house, he found that old madam he was chatting with old Madam Cen. ”

The two old ladies were talking about something and were laughing very happily.

“He ziteng walked up to greet her. “Grandma Cen, you’re here.” ”

Old Madam Cen nodded. “Ziteng.”

“Old Madam he smiled and said, “Ziteng, your grandma CEN is here to help you matchmake. Why aren’t you thanking your Grandma Cen?” ”

Matchmaking?

Matchmaking!

“When he ziteng heard this, he was in a bad mood. He immediately said, “Thank you, Grandma Cen, but I...” ”

“”But you what? Don’t tell me that you already have a girlfriend! I just asked your grandma, and she said that you’re still a dog.” ”

“A dog?”He ziteng turned to look at Old Mrs. He.

“Old Mrs. he said, “Isn’t a single dog just a dog? Could it be two dogs?” ”

Old Mrs. Cen laughed out loud. “Two dogs are still called single dogs?”

He ziteng:”...”he could no longer keep up with the fashion of his grannies.

“After saying that, old Mrs. Cen continued, “Ziteng, don’t worry. I have never been matchmaker to anyone in my entire life. This is the first and last time. The girl that Grandma Cen thinks highly of will definitely not be too bad!” ”

“I...”

“”I what?”Old Mrs. Cen said, “Look at how good the wife I found for your fifth brother is!” ”

He ziteng immediately shut up.

“Although Old Mrs. Cen was old, her aura was very strong. ”

“”That’s right, that’s right!”Old Mrs. he echoed, “With your Grandma Cen as your matchmaker, you can secretly be happy! Stop making excuses! Elder sister, where were we just now? Whose family did that little girl come from? What did she look like? It doesn’t matter if she comes from a family background. The most important thing is that she has a good character! She also has to be able to control ziteng!” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen said, “She’s that little girl from the Ouyang family. Her name is Ouyang Chen. She just graduated from university this year. Before Chen Chen went to school, she was studying abroad. Didn’t she just return to China? It was also fate. When Xiao Chen had just returned to China, she met Ziteng and fell in love with Ziteng at first sight... ... .. ”

“Ouyang Chen had been educated in the west since she was young. Her thoughts were free and unrestrained, and she did whatever she wanted without hesitation. ”

“Old Madam Cen had a deep relationship with the Ouyang family’s old Madam, so old Madam Ouyang asked her to talk about this matter. ”

“When she heard this, old madam he’s eyes lit up, and she continued, “Do you have a photo of the little girl? Let Me See!” ”

“Yes!”Old Madam Cen took out her phone.

“Old Madam he took the phone and enlarged the picture. “Nice! Nice! This little girl is indeed beautiful! Ziteng, you’re really lucky this time! To be able to get such a beautiful little girl to like you!” ”

“The Girl in the picture was standing on the beach with the blue sea and sky. She was wearing a light yellow halter dress. She was beautiful and elegant, and her temperament was outstanding! ”

“Seeing the photo, he ziteng frowned slightly. “So it’s her!” ”

“You still remember her?”Old Mrs. Cen turned to look at he ziteng.

“He ziteng said, “Grandma Cen, I thank you for your kindness, but it’s impossible for me to be with her. Please don’t waste your time! Please go back and tell her that I, he ziteng, am not worthy of her.” ”

“Not long ago, he ziteng did meet Ouyang Chen. ”

“In He Ziteng’s eyes, Ouyang Chen was just a spoiled brat! ”

Ouyang Chen was not her type either.

“Old Mrs. Cen said, “Who said you’re not good enough? Let me tell you, Xiao Chen really likes you! Most importantly, Xiao Chen is a very filial child. You’ll definitely regret missing her!” ”

Old Mrs. He looked at He ziteng. “Ziteng! You Don’t even like such a handsome little girl. What are you trying to do? Are you trying to rebel?”

“”It’s not a question of whether she’s handsome or not. It’s just that we’re not suitable for each other at all,”he ziteng said. ”

“Old Lady Cen sized he ziteng up and down. She narrowed her eyes slightly and said, “You... you’re not gay, are you?” ”
