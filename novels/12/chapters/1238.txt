“[ oh my God! I actually saw the former campus belle on this , 2000, quickly check if this is the campus belle of our school. ] ”

“[ I went to university with this Miss Zhao. When I was in C Nation, almost no one in the Chinese circle played with this miss. Now it seems that there is a reason why no one plays with her! ] ”

[ I’m so angry! She doesn’t deserve to be a human! ]

[ what a poor little kitten. I hope there is no pain in heaven. ]

[ I’m so angry! Why is there such a disgusting person in the world? ]

“[ people with twisted minds hope that the country can issue a law to punish such people, and not just use moral condemnation. ] ”

[ why is there no animal protection law? ]

[ I strongly support the cat owner to return the favor. Don’t forgive her easily! ]

[ can such trash still be the campus belle? That’s more like a joke! ]

“[ Zhao Xueyin’s address: No. 20,1890, Haixing Road, Jingfan Center. Wreaths, funeral clothes, paper dolls, and the like can all be arranged! ] ”

[[ I’m angry ] is there any humanity left? ]

“[ hell is empty, the Devil is in the human world. ] ”

[ strongly request Shunxi Financial Group to send out a disgusting person like Zhao Xueyin. ]

“[ it hurts to look at it, for a full 20 minutes. Oh My God! How much does this little kitten hurt? ] ”

“[ the heavens are watching, the humans are doing it! Just wait! One day, you will get your retribution! ] ”

[ this kind of person will go to hell sooner or later! ]

[ how could she bear to kill such a cute kitten? ]

[ ... ]

More than a million comments were condemning Zhao Xueyin.

“When Father Zhao opened his phone and saw the news, he was stunned. ”

“He did not expect that after half a month, Zhao Xueyin would be on the news hot searches again in this way. ”

Although killing a cat was nothing.

“However, the heat of this matter was too high, and it had already aroused the anger of the entire nation! ”

On the other side.

Zhao Xueyin hadn’t even walked out of the villa when she saw a group of reporters surrounding the door.

“When she thought about how she was going to be on camera soon, Zhao Xueyin was still a little excited. ”

One had to know.

Ordinary people couldn’t appear in front of the television screen even if they spent their entire lives.

“However, she appeared on television several times in a row. ”

“Because she had been chased out of the Ming family by Ming Yao, Zhao Xueyin had been labeled as ‘mentally ill’. She could take advantage of this opportunity to get rid of this label. ”

There was no lack of socialites in the financial circle.

“However, there really weren’t any talented socialites. ”

Especially socialites like her who appeared on television with her talent.

“”She’s here, she’s Here!” ” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Zhao Xueyin!”

“At this moment, the reporters noticed that Zhao Xueyin was walking towards them. They immediately swarmed over and surrounded Zhao Xueyin. ”

“Although they had already prepared for her article to become popular, Zhao Xueyin was still very surprised when she saw the reporters surrounding her. ”

Were all the reporters in the vicinity here?

“”Excuse me, are you Miss Zhao Xueyin?” ”

“Zhao Xueyin looked at the camera and smiled appropriately. “Hello Everyone, I’m Zhao Xueyin.” ”

She could actually smile in front of the camera.

The reporters looked at Zhao Xueyin with disbelief in their eyes.

“”Excuse me, Miss Zhao, why do you torture cats?” ”

“Don’t you know that cats are also a life form?”

“”When you torture cats, aren’t you afraid of retribution?” ”

“The Reporters’questions came one after another, causing Zhao Xueyin to be unable to react in time. ”

Torture Cats?

Weren’t the reporters here to interview her because of the article?

Wasn’t it just a cat?

Was there a need to make such a big fuss?

What exactly was going on?

“PA –”

“At this moment, an egg was thrown in a parabolic shape towards Zhao Xueyin. ”

It landed directly on Zhao Xueyin’s face.

The stench was coming from the front.

Zhao Xueyin was stunned on the spot. Before she could react.

“PA –”

“Another egg was thrown over, and it landed right on Zhao Xueyin’s mouth. ”

“Zhao Xueyin suddenly reacted. Her eyes widened and she screamed out loud. She screamed hysterically, “Ah!” ”

The reporters captured this scene and took pictures of Zhao Xueyin.

“Executioner!”

“Go to hell!”

“”Scum, die!” ”

“B * Tch!”

“More and more eggs fell on Zhao Xueyin’s head and body... Not long after, Zhao Xueyin was in a sorry state. ”

“Her entire body was wet and sticky, so disgusting that it made people want to vomit. ”

“When the butler and his bodyguards arrived, Zhao Xueyin’s entire body was covered in yellow mucus. ”
