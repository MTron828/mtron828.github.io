“Chapter 2046: 426: Ye Zhuo appears in the election, and Qiu Di and the others are dumbfounded! 3”

“Shangguan Jue gently raised his hands and said in a gentle tone, “Everyone, please listen to me.” ”

“Silence did not return to the air immediately, but his voice was much softer than before. ”

“Shangguan jue continued, “Miss Ye is a wise monarch. Not only do you miss her, but we also miss her. However, some things can not be stopped just because we can’t bear to part with her! “Autumn flute is a female monarch that miss ye has personally chosen. It has also gone through the assessment of our eight great clans. Please rest assured that our eight great clans are wholeheartedly thinking of the prosperity of changyue state and will absolutely not deceive you.” ”

“At this point, Shangguan jue paused and said, “Please believe in Miss Ye and also believe in our eight great clans.” ”

“With that, Shangguan Jue bowed to the crowd. ”

The crowd below the stage discussed animatedly.

The new female sovereign was personally chosen by Ye Zhuo?

How was that possible!

“”Head patriarch,”Bai Changhu stood up. “I have something to say.” ”

“The head patriarch looked up and nodded. “Old Mister Bai, please speak.” ”

“Bai changhu continued, “Since you said that the new female sovereign’s autumn flute was personally chosen by Miss Ye, then please ask Miss Ye to come over. We all want to hear Miss ye personally announce this news.” ”

“As soon as these words were said, everyone immediately echoed, “Old Mister Bai is right! We should let Miss ye personally announce this news.” ”

“Miss Ye!”

“Miss Ye!”

“Before ye Zao appeared, Changyue was no different from a plate of loose sand. ”

“After ye Zao appeared, Changyue became more like a country. ”

Prosperous and prosperous.

River Clear Sea Yan.

“Moreover, Ye Zhuo never felt that she was a female sovereign, never putting on any airs of a female sovereign. Therefore, everyone always addressed her as Miss Ye. ”

“When the head chief saw this scene, his eyes were slightly red. He held the microphone and said, “I understand everyone’s feelings. Actually, I’m the same as everyone else. I also really hope that Miss Ye can return. Unfortunately, Miss Ye can’t return...” ”

Can’t return.

The Chang Yue Kingdom could no longer be the same as before.

“The head chief knew that once this news was announced, the Chang Yue Kingdom would fall into deep trouble. ”

“However, some things could be hidden for a while, but could not be hidden forever. ”

“No matter what, this news had to be announced. ”

“Moreover, now that the news of ye Zhuomo’s death had spread... ”

“Why can’t Miss Ye Come Back? What happened exactly?”

“Hearing this, Bai Changhu’s heart thumped. ”

“Yu Zhenfei, who was by the side, also felt that things were not good. ”

He suddenly recalled that rumor.

Could it be...

Ye Zao was really gone?

No.

Impossible.

Ye Zao was invincible in every battle. She was the most legendary woman in changyue. How could she say that she was gone?

Yu Zhenfei comforted himself in his heart.

“The head chief choked and could not speak. After a while, he suppressed the sadness in his heart and continued, “Now, I want to announce a piece of news to everyone. Everyone will understand why Miss Ye has not shown up yet.” ”

“Hearing this, the venue fell into silence. ”

Everyone was waiting for the head chief to speak.

“The head chief held the microphone and organized his words in his mind. He had already thought of his words before he went on stage, but when he stood on the stage and wanted to announce this news, the head chief could not say a single word. ” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

It was very uncomfortable.

It was as if a stone had been stuck in his heart.

It was as if he had instantly returned to the month that ye Zao had met with an accident.

“At that time, the seven of them did not believe that ye Zao had really met with an accident. They took turns to guard ye Zao Day and night, hoping that she would wake up. ”

They even used the forbidden technique of the state of Chang Yue.

Unfortunately.

It was useless.

“Thinking of those days and nights, and thinking of the days when he fought side by side with Ye Zao, the head of the clan could not stop his tears, “Miss Ye sacrificed herself for scientific research in the year 10061 at 19:26 p.m. ... she was only twenty-one years old...” ”

Sacrificed herself for scientific research?

How could this be!

It was very quiet below the stage.

Very quiet.

It was almost so quiet that it was strange.

Zhao Dan and the secretary-general of the General Alliance were still fine.

“After all, they had long known about this news. ”

“However, Zhao Dan still felt a little regretful. ”

“Ye Zhuo had only been in office for two years, yet he had already allowed the changyue kingdom to stand shoulder to shoulder with the bug clan and Manxing Kingdom. It was enough to show that ye Zhuo was a rare and strange woman. ”

Such an extraordinary woman losing her life in scientific research was a loss to the Chang Yue Country!

Zhao Dan sighed lightly.

“If she had known this would happen, she would have met ye Zao once before. ”

“Ye Zao had been in office for two years, but Zhao Dan had never seen her in person. ”

“In addition, Ye Zao was a low-profile person. She had never even seen a picture of ye Zao. ”
