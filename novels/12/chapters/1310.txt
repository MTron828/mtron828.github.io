Translator: 549690339

“The deputy executive officer continued, “I’ll ask you to get executive officer ye a glass of water.” ”

“Executive Officer Ye?”Zheng Wanyin could not react in time.

“The deputy executive officer nodded and said with a smile, “Oh right, let me introduce you. This is the executive officer specially invited by the executive officer, Miss Ye. Miss Ye, this is our ABA core member, Zheng Wanyin.” ”

Listening to the Deputy Executive Officer’s words.

“Zheng Wanyin’s face was pale, her breathing was rapid, and her footsteps were unsteady. ”

It was really her.

Ye Zhuo was actually the main assessment officer.

How could this be?

“If ye Zhuo was really the main assessment officer, then what was her action just now? ”

Throwing a big knife in front of Guan Dong?

Zheng wanyin only felt her face burning in pain.

She had never expected ye Zhuoneng to be the main examiner...

Was Cen Shaoqing here for Ye Zhuoneng as well?

It had nothing to do with her?

“She, she had misunderstood? ”

Zheng Wanyin found it hard to breathe when she thought that she had misunderstood and thought that Cen Shaoqing was here for her.

“In particular, she had even circled around Cen Shaoqing. ”

She wondered if Cen Shaoqing had seen her.

It was embarrassing.

It was too embarrassing!

Zheng Wanyin had never experienced such an embarrassing thing in her life.

“One second ago, Zheng Wanyin was praying that Cen Shaoqing could see her. ”

Now...

She wished she could slap her stupid self to death.

Zheng Wanyin had always been very cautious. She knew that carelessness made a mistake in Jingzhou.

“However, she still underestimated ye Zao. ”

This round.

She lost.

It was a terrible loss.

Zheng Wanyin pinched her fingers and tried hard to calm herself down.

Failure was the mother of success.

She had to get up from where she had fallen.

“The deputy executive officer continued, “Well, Wanyin, hurry up and get some water.” ”

“”Okay, okay.”Zheng Wanyin finally reacted and turned around to get some water. ”

“”No need, I’m not thirsty.”Ye Zhuo closed the name list and looked up at the Deputy Executive Officer. “When will the assessment begin?” ”

The deputy executive officer looked at his watch. “There are still 15 minutes left.”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“The deputy executive officer turned to look at Zheng Wanyin. “Since you’re not thirsty, then you can go and do other things.” ”

“O-okay.”Zheng Wanyin turned around and walked towards the exit.

Her footsteps weighed a thousand pounds.

“When she left, Zheng Wanyin deliberately went around Cen Shaoqing’s back. ”

It was enough to lose face once.

She could not lose face again.

“”Yinyin.”At this moment, Xie Wanqiu’s voice sounded from behind. ”

“Grandma.”Zheng Wanyin turned around and smiled gently.

“Xie wanqiu continued, “Have you seen your cousin?” ”

Zheng Wanyin nodded. “Cousin-in-law is here too.” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Cousin-in-law?

“When she heard this, Xie Wanqiu’s face darkened. “Who’s your cousin-in-law?” ”

“”Ye Zhuo,”Zheng Wanyin said. ”

Xie wanqiu snorted coldly. “She wants to be your cousin-in-law. has she gotten my permission?”

Zheng Wanyin did not say anything.

“Xie wanqiu continued, “Didn’t your cousin say that he wouldn’t be coming yesterday? I saw him in the audience stand in the hall just now. What does that mean? It means that he has a cousin like you in his heart!” ”

“Zheng wanyin said, “Grandma, disaster comes from words. Don’t spout nonsense. Could it be that when you came in just now, you didn’t see cousin-in-law on the assessment officer’s Seat?” ”

Xie Wanqiu was stunned.

“Zheng wanyin continued, “Cousin-in-law is the main assessment officer this time.” ”

Ye Zhuo was the main assessment officer.

She was a contestant.

“Without comparison, there would be no harm. ”

“In front of Ye Zhuo, she didn’t even have a shadow. ”

Hearing this sentence.

Xie Wanqiu was also stunned.

Ye Zao was the main examiner?

“”What did you say just now?”Xie wanqiu said in disbelief, “Who did you say was the main examiner?” ”

“”Cousin-in-law.”Zheng wanyin continued, “So, cousin is not here to see me at all. Please don’t let your imagination run wild.” ”

“”Ye Zao is the main examiner?”Xie wanqiu frowned. “What qualifications does she have to be the main examiner? yinyin, stop joking!” ”

“Zheng Wanyin held Xie Wanqiu’s arm. “Grandma, I’m not joking with you. Cousin-in-law is really the assessment officer this time.” ”

Xie wanqiu narrowed her eyes and her expression did not look good.

“Zheng wanyin continued, “Grandma, I think you’ve really misunderstood cousin-in-law. Didn’t second aunt say that? Cousin-in-law is a very outstanding person. She has her own achievements in all fields. Second Aunt Even said that cousin-in-law is miracle doctor ye who cures cancer. Don’t you believe it. I think cousin-in-law is that Miracle Doctor Ye!” ”

“”I say, why don’t you have a little heart?”Xie wanqiu continued, “Zhou Xiang said that ye Zao is the Miracle Doctor Ye, and she is the Miracle Doctor Ye! Then she said that ye Zao is the Jade Emperor, and you also believe it?” ”
