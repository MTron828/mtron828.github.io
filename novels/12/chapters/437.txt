“Chapter 438: 122: Big Blaze’s domineering entrance, slapping Feng Xianxian in the face! 6”

Translator: 549690339

Fat Tiger and Li Wen were in the neighboring Qinghua.

“Dog two said, “Brother Ze, I’ll come down to look for you once I’m done packing.” ”

“Sure.”

“Li Wen lay on the bed. “Shall we have dinner tonight? By the way, can your school come out during military training?” ”

“”Sure,”Lin ze replied. ”

“Fat tiger cried, “We can’t. We’re doing closed-door training.” ”

“”Closed-door training is nothing,”dog two said. “Who doesn’t know that Beijing University’s military training is especially perverse? I heard that there was a class last year where half of the students collapsed!” ”

At the Lin family home.

Feng Qianhua sent Old Lady Lin to the Lin family home.

She was very regretful that she didn’t let Lin Ze choose a university in Yun Jing.

“Now that the boat had sailed, she couldn’t let Lin Ze go to another university! ”

“Aunt Zhang could tell that Feng Qianhua was worried and asked in a low voice, “What’s Wrong?” ”

Feng Qianhua couldn’t care less. “Ye Shu came to the capital!”

“What?”Aunt Zhang’s expression changed.

“Feng Qianhua continued, “That’s not the worst part!” ”

“What else happened?”Aunt Zhang asked.

Feng Qianhua narrowed her eyes. “Ye Shu found her biological daughter!”

Aunt Zhang’s face immediately turned pale. “Are you sure?”

“I saw it with my own eyes.”Feng Qianhua nodded.

That Little Bastard looked a little like ye Shu.

She couldn’t be mistaken.

That must be ye Shu’s daughter.

“Feng Qianhua continued, “Do you think that B * Tch ye Shu came back to snatch Jin city from me?” ”

The reason why Old Lady Lin did not accept ye Shu was because she thought that ye Shu had cheated on her.

If she knew the truth of the matter...

Ye Shu did not cheat on her. She just carried the wrong child. What would Old Lady Lin Do?

Old Lady Lin was someone who valued bloodlines very much.

“In addition, there had not been a single girl in the Lin family for so many years. ”

“With Old Lady Lin’s personality, she did not dare to hate ye Shu too much. For the sake of her granddaughter, she would definitely forgive ye Shu! ”

“”Qianhua, don’t be anxious.”Aunt Zhang held Feng Qianhua’s hand and continued, “Did that B * Tch Ye Shu see you today?” ”

How could Feng Qianhua not be anxious? This was a matter that threatened her position in life!

“She had guarded Lin Jin city for most of her life and was about to see the light of day. At this time, Ye Shu suddenly appeared. What she was most afraid of now was that ye Shu would bring her daughter to her door. ”

“”I’m not very sure, but I should have seen it.” ”

“Aunt Zhang continued, “She’s just a mistress. You and Jin city have a son and daughter now. She definitely wouldn’t have the face to come to find you! Moreover, Jin city is no longer the Lin Qingcheng of the past! Even if she wanted to find him, the capital is so big. Where would she find Lin Qingcheng?” ”

One was Lin Jin city.

The other was Lin Qingcheng.

“No matter how capable ye Shu was, she probably wouldn’t have thought that Lin Jincheng was the Lin Qingcheng of the past. ”

“With Aunt Zhang’s consolation, Feng Qianhua heaved a sigh of relief. ”

But she was still worried.

After returning to the Feng clan.

She asked someone to investigate ye Shu’s matter.

But it was very strange.

“No matter how she investigated, she couldn’t find out ye Shu’s current situation. ”

Ye Shu’s information still remained at the time when she was still living in the basement and her daughter was ye Yourong.

“Thus, Feng Qianhua sent people to investigate ye Zao. ”

Ye Zao’s information was only available at the MU residence.

“Idiot, trash... ”

“When she saw this label, Feng Qianhua heaved a sigh of relief. ”

An Idiot Trash definitely wouldn’t be able to attend the Capital University!

“Thus, Ye Zao was definitely not at the Capital University! ”

“Moreover, even if an idiot trash was really found, it wouldn’t pose much of a threat to her. ”

“After all, Feng Xianxian was ten thousand times better than her! ”

Old Lady Lin wouldn’t take a good-for-nothing as her granddaughter.

...

On the other side.

At school. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Ye Zao was sitting in front of his computer, typing furiously. ”

“Suddenly, a message box popped up on the computer that was operating normally. ”

Someone was investigating her and ye Shu?

Who was this person?

“Thinking of Ye Shu’s mood in the morning, ye Zao subconsciously felt that something was wrong with this matter. He immediately followed the other party’s signal and traced it back. ”

Feng Xianxian looked up at Ye Zao’s computer.

“From her point of view, Ye Zao’s computer screen was pitch black. ”

There was no picture at all.

It was obvious that this broken computer was not turned on at all.

“Or rather, this computer was broken! ”

It could not be used at all.

Then...

What was ye Zao doing?

“In order to not let others find out that her computer was broken, so she pretended to be playing with the computer? ”

She knocked the keyboard so loudly.

She showed an enigmatic look.

“If people did not know this, they would think that ye Zao was very powerful! ”
