Translator: 549690339

Ye Zao chuckled. “You’re just a monk. Why Are You worrying about this?”

The air was silent for a second.

“I’m not a monk.”

“Ye Zao continued, “Anyway, you’ve already seen through the secular world. What’s the difference between you and a monk?” ”

“Speaking up to this point, ye Zao continued, “Have you really never been in a relationship before?” ”

Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads. “No.”

Ye Zhuo turned his head slightly. “Then I’m very curious. How did you see through the secular world? Aren’t people like you who see through the secular world usually trapped by Love?”

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “I just feel that people shouldn’t live their lives just to get a wife and have children. What’s the point of having children after getting a wife and having children? What’s the point of this cycle?” ”

Humans were not animals.

They shouldn’t be born for reproduction.

They should live for themselves.

“What you said makes sense.”Ye Zhuo nodded. “This is indeed meaningless. I should learn from you.”

“You also think that my thinking is right?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“”I think it’s very right.”Ye Zhuo continued, “Life is so long. No one knows which comes first, tomorrow or an accident! Time is short. You should live for yourself! Just like what you said, there’s no need to get married just to complete the mission. What’s the difference between this and a machine?” ”

“Then will you find a boyfriend in the future?”Cen Shaoqing continued to ask.

“Ye Zhuo shook his head. “I don’t know. Maybe, maybe not.” ”

“Why?”

“Ye Zao said, “I’m not you. I’ve already seen through the mortal world! If I can meet the right person at the right time, I can still give it a try!” ”

“Ye Zao was a person who was content with the situation. She did not look forward to love, but she also did not resist love. ”

“However, in her previous life, she was still a single dog when she was twenty-seven years old. ”

“In this life, it was probably very difficult to meet the right person. ”

“After all, she was a beauty. ”

The only person by her side who met her aesthetic standards was a monk...

“Hearing this, Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly, ”

ye Zao did not resist love.

“In other words, there was a high possibility that Zhou Zeyan and she were together. ”

“Thinking of the image of Ye Zao and Zhou Zeyan together in the future, Cen Shaoqing felt as if something had been knocked over in her heart. She felt very uncomfortable. ”

Ye Zhuo seemed to have suddenly thought of something. He jumped down from the beach chair and looked at Cen Shaoqing. “Did you bring a lighter?”

“Cen Shaoqing looked up at her. In the morning glow, her facial features seemed somewhat unreal. ”

“What do you need a lighter for?”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “I brought a barbecue grill from the villa. Of course, it’s grilled fish.” ”

Cen Shaoqing took out a lighter from his pocket and handed it to her.

“Ye Zao took the lighter, took out the barbecue grill from the car, and began to cook the grilled fish. ”

“At the same time as the barbecue, ye Zao also used dry wood to light a bonfire. ”

The night by the beach was a little cold.

“She sat in front of the bonfire with one hand supporting her head and the other holding the grilled fish. Her jade-like face reflected the light of the fire, making it even more vivid. ”

Not long after.

A strong aroma of grilled fish came from the air.

Cen Shaoqing reclined on the beach chair with one hand resting on the back of his head as he looked at her.

He suddenly thought of a poem:

There are beauties in the north who are peerless and independent.

One looks down on a city and another looks down on a country.

It would be better to not know about the beauty of a city and a country. It would be hard to find a beauty again.

“At this moment, ye Zhuo looked back slightly and handed over a grilled plate. “I know you are a vegetarian, so I specially grilled some vegetables for you. I also used vegetable oil. Have a taste. How does it taste?” ”

“Thank you.”Cen Shaoqing sat up and took the roasting tray with both hands.

“There were grilled steamed bread slices, baby vegetables, cowpeas, leeks, and golden needle mushrooms on the roasting tray. Not only did it look good, but it also smelled very fragrant. ”

“Ye Zao took a big bite of the grilled fish. The grouper did not have any thorns, so he was very satisfied with the fish meat in one bite. He turned to look at Cen Shaoqing, “How does it taste? I don’t know if you can eat spicy food, so I put in a little bit of Chili.” ”

Cen Shaoqing tasted a piece of potato chip and complimented him generously.

“It’s very good.”

“Ye Zao said proudly, “Of course. Don’t you see who baked it? Ordinary people can’t eat it!” ”

Cen Shaoqing began to eat the mantou. “I’m very lucky.”

Night gradually fell.

“In a short while, the sky turned completely dark. ”

“After dinner, the two walked a few rounds along the beach. ”

“Although CEN Shaoqing had already seen through the mortal world, his thinking was not limited to eating vegetarian and chanting Buddhist scriptures. ”

“Ye Zhuo realized that whether it was future technology or ordinary chit-chat, he could pick up on it. Moreover, he had his own unique views. At the end of the conversation, the two of them still felt like they had met late. ”

...

On the other side.

Yunjing city.

“Ever since ye Sen had asked Bai Wei out for dinner the last time, the number of times the two of them met had obviously increased. ”

“Ye Sen smiled and said, “We agreed that I would treat you to a meal this time. You Can’t Go and secretly pay the bill again.” ”

“”Don’t worry, I won’t.”Bai Wei stirred the coffee in front of her. ”

Ye Sen ordered the dishes.

Bai Wei still ordered a vegetable salad.

“After dinner, Ye Sen invited Bai Wei to watch a movie. ”

“Bai Wei said, “I’m sorry. I still have two dance lessons this afternoon. Maybe another day.” ”

A disappointed look flashed in ye Sen’s eyes. “Okay then.”

Did he do something wrong that made Bai Wei angry?

“Ye Sen continued, “Where is your school? I’ll drive you there.” ”

Bai Wei nodded. “Then I’ll have to trouble you.”

“Seeing Bai Wei nod, ye Sen heaved a sigh of relief. Since she was willing to nod, it meant that she was not angry. ”

“What trouble is there? It’s my honor to be able to drive you to work.”

The car was moving very fast.

“Not long after, the car stopped in front of an office building. ”

“Bai Wei said, “This is the place.” ”

Ye Sen opened the car door. “Let me send you up.”

“Bai Wei smiled and said, “No need. I can go up by myself. Go Do Your Thing.” ”

“Just then, Ye Sen received a call from his secretary. It was quite urgent, so he got into the car. “Then I’ll go back first. We can watch a movie together when we have time.” ”

“Bai Wei sent him off with her eyes. “Okay, drive slowly on the road.” ”

“When the black car disappeared into the traffic ahead, a woman in a blue dress walked out of the office building. “How far have you guys progressed?” ”

“Bai Wei turned to look at her. The gentleness on her face disappeared. “Sister Yiyi, I feel that Ye Sen will confess to me at any time.” ”
