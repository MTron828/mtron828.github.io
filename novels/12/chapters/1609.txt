“Tang Xue nodded, feeling that her assistant’s words were quite correct.” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“The power raw material was the heart of an aircraft carrier, and now that the power raw material problem had not been resolved, what sort of activity could be heard from the greater C area?”

“Miss Tang! There’s someone outside looking for you!”An officer walked in.

“Who is it?”Tang Xue asked.

“The officer shook his head, “I don’t know either, but from the looks of it, it should be this year’s examinee.””

Examinee.

“Tang Xue suddenly called out to Bai Yun and immediately stood up from her chair, “Where is she now?””

“”She’s just outside,”the officer said.”

Tang Xue immediately walked outside.

“Bai Yun was wearing a beautiful dress and was standing there waiting for Tang Xue. When she saw Tang Xue coming over, Bai Yun immediately waved at her, “Cousin!””

“You’re here.”Tang Xue said with a smile.

“”En.”Bai Yun intimately held onto Tang Xue’s arm and continued, “It’s been a long time since we last met. Cousin, you’ve become beautiful again! I don’t even dare to acknowledge you!””

“The corners of Tang Xue’s mouth curled up slightly, “When did you arrive?””

“”I arrived in the morning. I even went to visit aunt. Aunt told me to look for you first after I came to the base. She said that you would help me take care of Everything!”After saying that.., bai Yun continued, “Cousin, I see that they are all very respectful to you! You are really amazing! When I came here, my mother kept telling me to learn from you! I Can’t let you lose face in the future!””

“Bai Yun’s words were full of flattery, which made Tang Xue very happy.”

Bai Yun was indeed different from Tang Mi.

People like Tang mi deserved to be nailed to the pillar of shame in the scientific research world forever.

“Tang Xue continued, “There are still two hours before the exam. Come with me to my office first.””

“Okay.”Bai Yun nodded.

“When they arrived at the office, Tang Xue asked her assistant to bring Bai Yun some coffee.”

“Bai Yun said in surprise, “Cousin, is that your assistant?””

“Yes.”Tang Xue nodded.

“Bai Yun said expectantly, “Then will I have an assistant in the future?””

“The Bai family’s family background was average, and they were not a prominent family. This was the first time Bai Yun had seen someone with an assistant in real life. If he could have an assistant behind him, he would definitely be very impressive!”

“”After passing the assessment, it still depends on performance. Not everyone deserves an assistant.”Tang Xue continued, “You work hard. I will arrange it for you in the future!””

“”Thank you, Cousin!”Bai Yun was very happy.”

“A moment later, the assistant brought over coffee.”

Bai Yun flattered Tang Xue in the office before coming to the examination venue.

“After Bai Yun left, Tang Xue went to the assessment office to make a trip.”

“Little Xue Is Here!”The assessment head stood up from his office chair.

“The assessment head was fifty-five years old this year and was about to retire. Before the Tang family’s old master retired, she had worked with Old Master Tang before, so she had always had a good impression of Tang Xue.”

“Grandfather Tang had made a lot of contributions to the base. As his granddaughter, Tang Xue would definitely not be too bad.”

“”Grandpa Chief Examiner.”Tang Xue smiled and said, “When I went out just now, I saw a stall selling roasted sweet potatoes outside. I heard that you liked to eat roasted sweet potatoes, so I brought one for you to try.””

“Thank you.”The chief examiner took the roasted sweet potatoes with both hands. “I like this one.”

“Tang Xue said, “You’re being too polite when you say that. When my grandfather was still alive, he told me that you were a very good person. Now that he’s gone, he’ll treat you as his grandfather in the future.””

“”Really?”The chief examinee said in surprise, “Did old professor Tang really say that?””

“Of course it’s true!”Tang Xue nodded.

“The chief examinee smiled and said, “I’m indebted to his great love.””

“When he looked up and saw Tang Xue still standing there, the chief examiner continued, “Little Xue, don’t stand there! Quickly sit down!””

“”Thank you, Grandpa Chief Examiner.”Tang Xue thanked him.”

“The chief examiner smiled and said, “You Child, you just said that I don’t need to be polite with you, but now you’re being polite with me!””

Tang Xue smiled embarrassedly.

“The Chief Examiner ate a mouthful of roasted sweet potatoes and continued, “Little Xue, is there something you need from me?””

“Tang Xue continued, “It’s nothing serious. I just wanted to ask you, is the recruitment assessment today?””

“”Yes.”The chief examiner nodded. “Xiaoxue, why are you asking this?””

“”It’s like this, Grandpa Chief Examiner. I have a cousin named Bai Yun. She also participated in this year’s assessment. I’m afraid that someone with the same name as her will get the results wrong. Can I trouble you to check if there are any examinees with the same name as my cousin?”Tang Xue said.”

“”Alright, then I’ll help you check.”The assessment head put down the sweet potato and turned on the computer.”

“After a moment, he raised his head to look at Tang Xue and continued, “Don’t worry. There’s only one examinee this year named Bai Yun.””

“Tang Xue nodded and smiled, “Grandpa Assessment Head, then I’ll leave my cousin Bai Yun to you to take care of her. I still have some matters to attend to over there, so I’ll go over first.””

“The assessment head was a smart person. She had already made her words so clear, so he should be able to understand the hidden meaning behind her words.”

“Moreover, Old Master Tang had been kind to the assessment head, so the assessment head knew what to do.”

The assessment head did not react for a moment and nodded. “You go and do your work first.”

“Watching Tang Xue’s back disappear outside the door, the assessment head frowned.”

What did Tang Xue Mean by that?

She wanted him to take care of Bai Yun?

She wanted him to use the back door for Bai Yun? To make an internal decision?

“The head examiner thought that Tang Xue was the descendant of Old Master Tang and that she must be just like old master tang, full of righteousness. He did not expect that Tang Xue would actually do such a thing.”

“In an instant, the head examiner’s impression of Tang Xue was extremely bad.”

Or could it be that Bai Yun was indeed extraordinary?

“In order to avoid any misunderstandings towards Tang Xue, the examiner personally made a trip to the assessment room.”

Assessment Room.

“Different from the other examinees, Bai Yun sat in front of the assessment table and was using a makeup mirror to refill her lipstick. In any case, she had already been decided internally and it did not matter whether she read or not.”

“”Examiner, that is Bai Yun.”The assistant pointed at Bai Yun and introduced her to the examiner.”

“Seeing Bai Yun, the chief examiner frowned slightly.”

“The other examinees were all reading books and doing experiments, but Bai Yun was busy putting on makeup.”

She wasn’t here to participate in the assessment! She was clearly here to participate in the beauty contest!

“Half an hour later, the assessment officially began.”

“Looking at the questions on the assessment paper, Bai Yun’s head was big. She studied finance in university, so she didn’t know much about scientific research.”

She even knew someone.

“Thinking that it was not appropriate to hand in the blank test paper, Bai Yun randomly filled in a bunch of questions.”

“Two hours later, the test competition ended.”

Fifty examinees were waiting in the waiting room for the results.

“Everyone looked anxiously at the assessment screen. Bai Yun was still as calm as ever. Some examinees saw that she was still calm, so they tried to strike up a conversation with her. “Classmate, did you do particularly well in the test?””

“Bai Yun nodded and said confidently, “Yes, in short, it’s no problem for you to be admitted.””

“”I’m really envious of you! By the way, What’s Your Name?””

“My name is Bai Yun. What’s Yours?”

“My name is Zou Ying.”

“At this moment, the voice of the assessment officer finally came from the waiting hall. “Congratulations, everyone. A total of 15 examinees have been admitted this year. Please Come and report to the assessment director’s office if your names have been read out.””

“”Liu Siyu, Zhou Ying, Feng Jun, Ma Yue, Zou Ying...””

“Upon hearing this, Zou Ying said excitedly, “You’ve reported to me! Bai Yun, I’ll wait for You!””

Bai Yun nodded. “Okay.”

“The announcer’s voice continued, “Sun Hai, Ouyang Yi... the above 15 candidates, please report to the Assessment Director’s Office.””

Bai Yun’s face turned pale.

“She, why didn’t she hear the announcer say her name?”

Wasn’t she chosen?

What was going on?
