Chapter 1165: 252: a large-scale face-smacking scene! 1

Translator: 549690339

“Granny Zhou stood rooted to the ground, unable to react for a long time. ”

Her expression was also very ugly.

“Regret, discomfort, and all sorts of emotions were mixed together, and she could hardly breathe. ”

She had been sick for decades.

“In her dreams, she wanted to be like a normal person and be able to cure diabetes. ”

“However, she had personally given up this chance to cure diabetes! ”

How could she not feel uncomfortable?

“Seeing her like this, auntie Wang asked, “Old Madam, Are You Alright?” ”

Granny Zhou did not say anything.

“Old Madam?”Auntie Wang waved her hand in front of Granny Zhou’s eyes.

“Only then did Granny Zhou React. The smile on her face was a little forced. “I’m fine, I’m fine.” ”

“After saying that, Granny Zhou continued, “Oh right, Auntie Wang, do you still have the prescription that Miss Ye gave you previously?” ”

“Of course, the prescription was there, but Auntie Wang could not give it to Granny Zhou. ”

What was the most important thing for a doctor?

“Of course, it was trust! ”

“However, Granny Zhou did not even have the most basic trust in ye Zhuo. She could not give the prescription to Granny Zhou on her own. ”

This was a form of disrespect to ye Zhuo!

“If it was not for Granny Zhou not trusting Ye Zhuo, she would have long recovered just like Su Qiang. ”

“Auntie Wang said, “I’m really sorry, Old Lady. After my wife recovered, Miss Ye took the prescription back. We don’t have the prescription in our hands now.” ”

“Granny Zhou wasn’t a fool. Of course, she could understand the hidden meaning behind Auntie Wang’s words. ”

It wasn’t Auntie Wang’s fault.

This wasn’t Auntie Wang’s fault at all.

She deserved it!

“If she were Auntie Wang, she would be the same as Auntie Wang. ”

“”It’s fine, it’s fine.”Grandma Zhou shook her head. ”

“Auntie Wang continued, “Old Lady, we still have some matters to attend to, so we’ll be leaving first. Since we’ve already met you today, I won’t be going to your house.” ”

Auntie Wang was originally thinking of going to the Zhou family when she had time to greet Grandma Zhou.

“After all, when she was working in the Zhou family, Grandma Zhou had indeed treated her very well. ”

One thing led to another.

One could not be ungrateful as a person.

Granny Zhou nodded. “Then you two can go back to your work first.”

Auntie Wang and Su Qiang left with their children.

“Granny Zhou looked at the backs of Auntie Wang and her family of three, unable to put on any expression. ”

“After a moment, she let out a deep sigh. ”

Over here.

“Su Qiang raised his head to look at Auntie Wang. “Her mother, isn’t that prescription at our house? Why did you say that Miss Ye took the prescription back?” ”

Auntie Wang told Su Qiang the whole story.

“Hearing that, Su Qiang nodded. “So that’s how it is! Then this old lady shouldn’t have. No wonder miss ye said that they don’t have any medical affinity.” ”

“After meeting Auntie Wang’s family of three, Granny Zhou didn’t even want to go shopping anymore and went straight home. ”

“The Butler noticed that her expression wasn’t right and asked carefully, “Old lady, are you feeling unwell? Do you want to invite Doctor Qian over to take a look?” ”

“Granny Zhou looked at the butler. “Let me ask you, did Aunt Wang really resign on her own?” ”

“She did not expect Granny Zhou to suddenly ask this. A layer of cold sweat appeared on the butler’s forehead. “Yes, it is said that her lover is not feeling well and wants to resign to take care of her lover.” ”

“”If she is not feeling well, how many people who are not feeling well can go shopping?”Granny Zhou turned to look at the butler. ”

The Butler’s heart skipped a beat.

Not Good!

Look at the old lady. Did she see Auntie Wang?

“”Butler Sun, tell me honestly. What’s going on?”Granny Zhou’s voice suddenly became stern. ”

“Butler Sun was so scared that his face turned pale. He quickly told her everything. “Old Lady, you really can’t blame me for this. It was madam who asked me to do this! I didn’t have a choice!” ”

“Although he was a butler, he still worked for someone else. ”

“When Ma Jia Yue asked him to do this, he didn’t dare to disobey. ”

But now...

He was no longer human.

“As expected, it was Ma Jia Yue’s doing. ”

Granny Zhou was so angry that her whole body was trembling.

“You can go down first.”

The butler bent down and walked out.

Granny Zhou went upstairs.

“Ma Jia Yue was lying on the rattan chair on the third floor’s balcony, applying a facial mask. “Mom, you’re back! Please help me get the essence, it’s the one on the cabinet next to me.” ” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Ma Jia Yue had caused her to be in such a state, yet she was still in the mood to apply a facial mask! ”

“Granny Zhou was already very angry, but when she saw this scene, she was so angry that her face turned pale. ”

She grabbed the essence beside her and directly threw it on the ground.

PA —

The fragments scattered in all directions.

“The sudden sound of shattering shocked Ma Jia Yue. “Mom, what are you doing?” ”

“Granny Zhou pointed at Ma Jia Yue and said, “Ma Jia Yue, let me ask you, why did sister-in-law Wang resign?” ”
