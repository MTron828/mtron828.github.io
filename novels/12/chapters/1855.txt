The two of them were like happy enemies.

“When they couldn’t see each other, they would miss each other. When they could see each other, they would start to make fun of each other. No matter what, they had to fight to see who was better! ”

“Old Lady Zuo said, “In the future, I won’t go to country C anymore. I’ll settle down in the capital. You can come and find me anytime. However, at our age in life, seeing each other is one less thing! Don’t think that my words are unlucky. I don’t know when I’ll die!” ”

“Hearing this, Old Lady Cen Sighed. ” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Wasn’t life just a matter of opening and closing your eyes? Damn

“Hearing the word ‘Die’, the little guy immediately raised his head to look at Old Lady Zuo. “Great-grandmother, don’t worry. You Won’t Die!” ”

“Old Lady Zuo chuckled when she heard this. “Silly child, how can anyone not die?” ”

Who in this world didn’t die?

“Even Qin shihuang, who wanted to live forever, couldn’t escape death in the end. ”

“I’m serious. You really won’t Die!”The little guy said very seriously.

Old Lady Zuo patted the Little Guy’s head.

Old Lady Cen smiled and bent down. “Then will I Die?”

The little guy looked at Old Lady Cen and nodded. “You will.”

“Old Lady Cen continued, “Then why won’t your great-grandmother die? Zihan, you are too biased!” ”

The little guy was quite good at watching people cook.

“”It’s not biased,”the little guy continued, “Because teacher KT often said that my great-grandmother is old and won’t die! So, Grandma will definitely be old and won’t Die!” ”

“This old woman, wasn’t she an old woman? ”

“The child’s thinking was very simple. He did not feel that this was a bad thing at all. Instead, he felt that it was a good thing, ”

“when she heard this, Old Mrs. Cen could not help but laugh out loud. ”

Old Woman!

Hahaha!

How could she have thought that this little guy would say such a golden sentence.

“When she heard this, Old Mrs. Zuo’s expression was a little ugly. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Who is teacher Kt? isn’t this misleading people’s Children?” ”

“Mrs. Zuo also felt a little awkward and continued, “It’s a Chinese teacher, but he no longer teaches children.” ”

“The little guy looked up at Mrs. Zuo and said, “Grandma, could it be that teacher KT is wrong? Will Grandma Die of old age? Then why did teacher KT say that Grandma will not die of old age?” ”

“In the child’s impression, everything the teacher said was right. That was why he remembered this sentence so deeply. ”

“Chinese culture was extensive and profound. A sentence had many layers of meaning. For a moment, Mrs. Zuo did not know how to explain it to the little guy. She could only say, “I’ll tell you when I go back. Quickly say goodbye to Great Grandma and sister.” ”

“Fortunately, the little guy did not ask any more questions and continued, “Goodbye, Great-grandma. Goodbye, beautiful sister.” ”

“Goodbye.”

“After sending her off to the car, old Mrs. Cen laughed out loud. “This child, I’m dying of Laughter!”Ever since she found out that Zuo Feng actually had a child, old Mrs. Cen had always felt that she was being suppressed by Old Mrs. Zuo, this time, she was finally able to hold her head up high! ”

How delightful!

“Ye Zao stretched out his hand to support old Mrs. Cen. “Slow down, don’t fall.” ”

“”Don’t worry, you won’t fall.”Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Zao Zao, did you see your Grandma Zuo’s expression just now?” ”

Ye Zao nodded slightly.

The two of them had just entered when Cen Shaoqing walked out with Ye Zao’s bag.

“Old Mrs. Cen asked, “Where are you going?” ”

“To send Zao to school.”

“As summer vacation approached, the school was getting busier and busier. Ye Zao promised the Counselor to do an experiment at five in the afternoon. If Cen Shaoqing had not mentioned it, ye Zao would have forgotten about it! ”

“Hearing this, Old Mrs. Cen said with disappointment, “You still want to go to school now?” ”

She had originally wanted ye Zao to accompany her for dinner!

“With Ye Zhuo accompanying her, she could eat more for dinner. ”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “I promised the counselor that I would definitely go.”

“”Alright then.”Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Remember to come home more often when you’re free and accompany Grandma for dinner.” ”

“”Yes, don’t worry, I will.” ”

“Let’s go.”Cen Shaoqing looked at Ye Zhuo.

Ye Zhuo turned around and followed Cen Shaoqing’s footsteps.

They sat in the passenger seat.

“The two of them did not say anything, and the atmosphere was a little strange. ”

Cen Shaoqing started the engine and left.

“Ye Zao secretly looked at his profile and then said, “Can we really not discuss hypnosis anymore?” ”

“”No,”Cen Shaoqing said concisely. ”

“Why are you like this?”Ye Zao said.

Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips opened slightly. “Hypnosis is too exhausting for the body. We’ll talk about it after a week.”
