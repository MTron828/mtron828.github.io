The big shots from all sides wanted to find Dongli before the main alliance country.

It was easier to do things with more people.

Who Didn’t want to climb up to the future big shots of the main alliance country?

Including master Cao.

Master Cao mainly wanted to pave the way for full stars.

Unfortunately.

“Other than the people within the main alliance country, no one knew where the young master of Dongli was training. ”

“Hearing this, master Cao shook his head. “There’s no news at the moment.” ”

“MAN XING continued, “Master, you didn’t get someone to keep an eye on the Duanmu Family?” ”

“”The Duanmu Family?”Master Cao frowned slightly, not understanding what man Xing meant. ”

“Man Xing explained, “The daughter of the Duanmu family has always married the future monarch of the General Alliance. How Can Duanmu Feng sit still at a time like this?” ”

“Upon hearing this, master Cao’s eyes instantly lit up. ”

“”Yes, yes, yes, it’s like this!” ”

Man Xing was indeed a natural king. She was always able to think of things that others would not think of at the first moment.

“”But Master,”man Xing continued, “The Duanmu family is, after all, a member of the alliance. There are some things that should not be overdone.” ”

“If the Duanmu family were to find out something small, it would not look good. ”

Master Cao nodded. “I know that.”

...

On the other side.

Lin family.

“In order to celebrate the addition of new members to the family, the Lin family held a welcoming banquet to announce ye Han as their adopted son. ”

Ye Han wasn’t used to it.

He thought that following ye Zhuo back to Earth was just a formality. He didn’t expect that he would be treated as the main character.

“However, it could also be seen from this that the Lin family valued ye Zhuo. ”

A House of love can reach the crow.

“Why are you sitting here alone?” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“At this moment, a pleasant voice suddenly appeared in the air. ”

“Hearing this, Ye Han immediately stood up. “Brother.” ”

Lin Ze patted ye Han’s shoulder. “Are you not used to the living environment on Earth?”

Ye Han was stunned.

Did Ye Zao tell them everything?

“To the Earthlings, he was an alien. ”

“If this secret was exposed, the balance between the s galaxy and the Milky Way galaxy for thousands of years would be broken. ”

“Lin Ze smiled and said, “Don’t Worry, Zao didn’t say anything. I guessed it myself. From the first time I saw Zao, I knew that my sister was not an ordinary person.” ”

Ye Han was stunned again.

He recalled ye Zao’s description of Lin Ze.

He and ye Zao were siblings from the same mother. Lin Ze had grown up by his grandmother’s side. He was a bit of a loner and didn’t talk much. He studied psychology and was good at Reading People’s minds.

It seemed that this brother wasn’t an ordinary person.

“If he had only studied psychology, he wouldn’t have guessed that he was from an alien planet. ”

“”Since you’ve guessed it, I Won’t hide it from you,”ye Han continued, “I am indeed from another planet, but I will tell you the details.” ”

“Lin ze nodded and continued, “Brother Ye Han, don’t worry. Zhuluo is my biological sister and my parents’biological daughter. We are all her family and will not bully her. You are welcome to come home anytime.” ”

“”Thank you,”ye Han said. ”

Lin Ze smiled faintly and looked up at the horizon. “Didn’t uncle say that we are all family? There’s no need to thank me.”

Ye Han nodded.

“Lin Ze stood up, he continued, “The banquet in the front hall has already started. Let’s go. I’ll bring you down to identify the person. “We have many relatives in our family. I reckon that you probably haven’t experienced this at your place. In a while, you can just follow behind me and call me whatever I call you! “You don’t have to be nervous. Our relatives are all very friendly and easy to get along with. You Don’t have to worry about other problems.” ”

“For some reason, when Lin ze said the word ‘our family’, his heart felt very warm. ”

“Okay.”

“Seeing the two of them come down, Ye Zhuo walked over with his hands in his hands. “Brother, where did you take ye Han?” ”

“”The two of us brothers chatted for a while.”Lin Ze continued, “Where are dad and mom?” ”

“Ye Zhuo said, “They’re over there chatting with uncle, aunt, and the others. Quickly bring ye Han over.” ”

“After learning that Lin Jincheng and ye Shu had adopted a foster son, the Lin family’s brothers also attached great importance to him. ”

They all wanted to see what ye Han looked like.

Lin Ze nodded. “Okay.”

“After saying that, Lin Ze turned to look at Ye Han. “Let’s go over there.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Han followed in Lin Ze’s footsteps.

“Ye Han was originally a very arrogant young man, but in front of Lin Ze and the Lin family, he had an inexplicable sense of familiarity. He subconsciously wanted to get close to them and become one with them. ”

“Lin Ze brought ye Han over and politely greeted everyone. “Dad, Mom, first uncle, second uncle, third uncle, and fourth uncle.” ”
