“Li Qiandong picked up the USB flash drive on the ground, went to the car, and connected to the data cable. ”

It was indeed a racing video.

It was recorded with a drone.

The person driving the car was indeed ye Zao.

But what could this mean?

A racing video could mean that ye Zao was not pretending to be Mu Yourong?

“Ye Zao had been impersonating Mu Yourong since he was young, and now he was impersonating Mu Yourong! ”

He was too heartless!

So what if this kind of person had the ability?

She was still incomparable to Mu Yourong’s tiny finger!

Li Qiandong angrily turned off the video.

…

It was already the second day after ye Zao learned that Shen Rong had died from gas poisoning.

“No matter what, Shen Rong had once raised the original owner. Now that she was dead, it was reasonable for her to send him off. ”

“Thus, Ye Zao changed into black clothes and black pants and drove to the funeral home. ”

“At present, the Mu family had already scattered. ” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Those who were on good terms with the MU family in the past did not appear.

“In the funeral home, only Mu Yourong was kneeling on the ground and crying uncontrollably. ”

“Ye Zao walked to the ice coffin and bowed deeply, then offered his chrysanthemum. ”

“Seeing Shen Rong’s face in the ice coffin, ye Zao frowned slightly. ”

“Although the mortician had already put on makeup for her, it still could not cover the black color on her neck. ”

This feature was indeed more suitable for the appearance of death from gas poisoning.

Gas poisoning was carbon monoxide poisoning.

“If a person inhaled too much carbon monoxide, the oxygen would lose the chance to combine with hemoglobin, causing the tissue cells to not be able to get enough oxygen from the blood, causing their complexion to turn purple and black. ”

“However, a normal person would die from gas poisoning. It was not so black. The black on Shen Rong’s neck was abnormally black. ”

This situation was a bit like a good friend of Ye Zao’s in his previous life.

“His good friend had a very serious depression and was also poisoned by gas. However, she committed suicide. In order to make it painless, she took three sleeping pills. ”

An excessive amount of sleeping pills would cause the color of the skin on the face to be different from that of a normal person who died from gas poisoning.

Could it be that Shen Rong had taken sleeping pills before she died?

“Because she had taken sleeping pills and overslept, she did not go to the kitchen to turn off the fire. ”

But why would Shen Rong take sleeping pills for no reason?

It would be understandable if she took sleeping pills at night.

But Shen Rong’s time of death was at noon!

Who would take sleeping pills in the morning?

“Moreover, based on Ye Zhuo’s understanding of Shen Rong, she did not seem like the kind of person who would commit suicide. ”

“Moreover, Shen Rong had just found her own daughter. ”

How could she bear to die?

This place was filled with oddities.

“Ye Zao turned to look at Mu Yourong, who was kneeling there, and narrowed his eyes. ”

“At this moment, footsteps could be heard in the air. ”

It was Li Qiandong.

“When he saw ye Zao in the Mourning Hall, Li Qiandong’s anger immediately rose. “What are you doing here? Are You Crying for mercy? You are not welcome here!” ”

“If it wasn’t for Ye Zhuo, Cen Shaoqing and Old Lady Cen wouldn’t have such a deep misunderstanding of Mu Yourong! ”

“Mu Yourong raised her head to look at Li Qiandong and said in a hoarse voice, “Big Brother Li, Sister Ye Zhuo is here to send my mother off on her final journey! How can you say that about her!” ”

“”Aren’t you tired of acting all day long?”After saying this, Ye Zhuo turned his gaze to Li Qiandong. “Also, I don’t think I’ve offended you before, right?” ”

Li Qiandong raised his head to look at Ye Zhuo. “The one who’s really acting is you! Do You Know Who Yourong is? She’s fifth brother’s fiancée! I advise you to stay away from fifth brother in the future! Don’t think about those things that you shouldn’t think about!”

“Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “So you’re Cen Shaoqing’s previous fiancée who despises the poor, loves the rich, and is ungrateful?”She had previously heard old lady cen mention Cen Shaoqing’s fiancée. ”

She did not expect this person to be Mu Yourong.

This world was really small.

“Mu Yourong’s face was full of humiliation as she cried, “I’m not ungrateful! I’m Not! This has nothing to do with me!” ”

This was all soldier Mu and Shen Rong’s fault.

Ye Zhuo raised his brows slightly.

“Seeing Mu Yourong being wronged like this, Li Qiandong was very angry. He could not bear to see Mu Yourong being wronged. ”

“”Ye Zao! I advise you to apologize to yourong immediately! Otherwise, don’t blame me for being impolite!”Li Qiandong clenched his fists and his entire body was trembling. ”

The tolerance in his body had already reached its limit.

Ye Zao looked down at Li Qiandong. “What? You want to fight one-on-one?”

The anger in Li Qiandong’s body exploded in an instant. He waved his fists and charged towards ye Zao.
