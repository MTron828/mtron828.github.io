“Lin qingxuan nodded, “Of course it’s true! Why would I lie to you about something like this?” ”

“Old Lady Lin was very happy and continued, “How is the woman? where is her family?”The Lin family was not a small family, and not just anyone could marry into it. ”

“Lin Qingxuan did not say it directly, but said, “She is a very outstanding person. You will know when you see her.”In Lin Qingxuan’s eyes, Xia Xiaoman was a particularly outstanding woman. ”

“Although she had experienced an unfortunate marriage, she still relied on her own strength to stand up. ”

Lin Qingxuan admired Xia Xiaoman’s strength very much.

That unceasing strength!

“Moreover, Lin Qingxuan also saw her own shadow in Xia Xiaoman. ”

They had been hurt all over by the people they trusted the most.

“In addition, the two of them were not young anymore, so they decided to settle down their relationship as soon as possible and then go to collect the marriage certificate. ”

“Hearing Lin Qingxuan’s words, old Mrs. Lin heaved a sigh of relief. ”

Lin Qingxuan was the most obedient of the five sons.

“With her previous warning and reminder, she believed that Lin Qingxuan would definitely choose a girlfriend of the same social status. ”

Lin Qingxuan would definitely not deliberately anger her and oppose her.

“Knowing that Lin Qingxuan had finally found the right person, the brothers and sisters-in-law of the Lin family were also very happy. ”

“Wu Mei teased with a smile, “Fourth brother, if you put it that way, I’m getting more and more curious about what my future fourth brother and sister-in-law look like. Can you tell sister-in-law how the two of you met?” ”

“Yang Wenyin also joined in the jeering, “That’s right. Fourth brother and sister-in-law are all here today. You have to tell us about your future fourth brother and sister-in-law! To be able to conquer fourth brother and sister-in-law, this future junior brother and sister-in-law is definitely not a simple person!” ”

“Although Lin Qingxuan had a ridiculous marriage, he was not a muddle-headed person. Otherwise, he would not have been able to do so well overseas. ”

Everyone was very curious about what kind of person Lin Qingxuan had found.

“Zhang Zhenzhen said, “Fourth brother, do you have a photo? Show it to us all! Satisfy Our Curiosity!” ”

“Ye Shu also joined in the fun. “That’s right. Sister-in-law, second sister-in-law, and third sister-in-law. Don’t tease fourth brother. When the time comes, fourth brother will be embarrassed to bring back his future fourth sister-in-law.” ”

“Lin Qingxuan said a little embarrassedly, “Sister-in-law, sister-in-law, sister-in-law, and sister-in-law are... fourth brother and sister-in-law. Don’t worry. I’ll bring her back on the 28th of December. You’ll see her then.” ”

“Today was already the 25th of December. There were only three days left until the 28th of December. Hearing this, everyone stopped teasing Lin Qingxuan. ”

Ye Zhuo was a little curious.

He did not know if Lin Qingxuan’s girlfriend was Xia Xiaoman.

“After all, she had seen Lin Qingxuan and Xia Xiaoman on a date last time. ”

“Just as ye Zao was puzzled, seventh cousin’s wife picked up a pearl ball with her chopsticks and placed it into ye Zao’s Bowl. “Little twelve, eat more meat. Look at how skinny you are.” ”

“In the entire Lin family, Ye Zao was probably the skinniest. ” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“She was 1.73 meters tall, and her weight was only 96. ”

“”Thank you, seventh cousin.” ”

“Sixth Cousin’s wife smiled and said, “I think our little twelve has a physique that doesn’t get fat from eating. He’s unlike me, who gets fat even after drinking a mouthful of cold and white meat.”Sixth Cousin’s wife was Lu Zijin, a model. She was usually very strict with the management of her figure, every morning, the first thing she did when she woke up was to weigh herself. ”

Liu Tangsao was extremely envious when she saw how much ye Zhuo loved desserts and how skinny he was.

“”Little twelve, how much do you weigh?”The second Tangsao asked. ”

Ye Zhuo looked up slightly. “I weighed 96 pounds last year.”

96 pounds?

“When they heard this, the cousins were all very surprised and even a little envious. ”

“The Little Fatty Duan Duan, who was beside Ye Zhuo, raised his head proudly. “Auntie, I’m already 50 pounds this year! Auntie, I’m more than half of you!” ”

“Duan Duan is great!”Ye Zhuo patted the chubby boy’s head.

“Luo Luo said, “Then I want to eat more! I want to eat more than brother Duan Duan! I want to protect Auntie when I’m Fat!” ”

“I want to become fat to protect Auntie!”

“The five little guys who were reluctant to eat began to eat, making people laugh. ”

“After dinner, Wu Mei, Yang Wenyin, and Zhang Zhenzhen took ye Shu to play mahjong. ”

Ye Zhuo was dragged by the five little ones to build a snowman.

It was the end of the year.

It snowed almost every day in the capital.

“Looking at her sons and daughters-in-law, old Mrs. Lin suddenly felt sad. Now that the children were all here, no one cared about her health. ”
