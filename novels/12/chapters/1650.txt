Translator: 549690339

“Yu Yuan was stunned. “Zhang Panti! How can you say such shameless words! What you did is what you did, and you still find so many excuses for yourself! A woman like you should be alone for Life!” ”

How dare you take advantage of her!

Zhang Panti was the only one who could say such words.

“”Shut up! What right do you have to criticize me here! And how are you more noble than me!”Zhang Panti said angrily. “I’ve only broken up with Zi Fei for a few days, and you’re already taking advantage of me! You Shameless Mistress!” ”

Yu Yuan was so angry that her face turned red. This was the first time in her life that she had called her a mistress!

“Yu Zifei frowned slightly. Obviously, he did not expect Zhang Panti to be such a person. He turned to Yu Yuan and said, “Yuan Yuan, let’s Go! There’s no need to waste your breath following such a person.” ”

“If he had known that Zhang Panti was like this, Yu Zifei would not have come downstairs to see her. ”

Yu Yuan nodded and held onto Yu Zifei’s arm as they walked towards the apartment building.

No.

She could not let Yu Zifei leave!

She and Yu Zifei had been together for so many years. How could she not be comparable to a little girl who appeared out of Nowhere?

“”Zifei!”Zhang Pengdi grabbed onto Yu Zifei’s wrist. “Zifei, please don’t Leave Me! Give me another chance!” ”

“Yu Zifei didn’t say anything more, he just threw Zhang Pandi away. ”

“Zhang Pandi was thrown to the ground, her heart was sad. ”

She was wrong!

She was really wrong.

She shouldn’t have trusted Yu Zifei.

She shouldn’t have broken up with Yu Zifei.

It was all her fault!

On the other side.

“Ye Zhuo was sitting in front of the desk, typing on the keyboard. ”

“The air was very quiet, so quiet that only the sound of the keyboard could be heard. ”

“Ten minutes later, ye Zao typed the last word, clicked save, and then sent the document out. ”

“”Zaozao!”At this moment, Ye Shu’s voice suddenly came from the air. ”

“From the sound of footsteps, she seemed to be in a hurry. ”

“Ye Zao looked back slightly. “What’s wrong, Mom?” ”

“Ye Shu walked in with a smile and continued, “Lizi’s mom, it’s your fourth aunt. Your fourth aunt is pregnant!” ”

“Really?”Ye Zhuo was a little surprised.

“Ye Shu said, “Of course it’s true! It’s been more than two months!” ”

“”Then fourth uncle must be very happy,”ye Zhuo said. ” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Ye Shu continued, “That’s right. I heard from the Butler that your fourth uncle was so happy that he fainted!” ”

“Ye Zhuo turned his eyes slightly and continued, “Then we must congratulate fourth uncle and fourth aunt.” ”

“Xia Xiaoman was pregnant as she wished, and Ye Zao was genuinely happy for them. ”

“After saying that, ye Zao seemed to have thought of something and continued, “What do you mean? Won’t I have more little brothers and sisters in the future?” ”

“That’s right.”Ye Shu nodded.

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “I want to tell Cen Shaoqing this good news.” ”

“After all, Cen Shaoqing had wanted to become his brother-in-law for a long time. He just didn’t know how Cen Shaoqing’s expression would be when he knew that he would have a little brother or sister. ”

...

Old Xu never expected that the price of Diamonds would fall to the bottom overnight!

“Yesterday, the price of diamonds was still very high! ”

How did the price of a collection-grade diamond become like cabbage today?

Old Xu looked at the computer and thought that he was hallucinating. He wiped his eyes with his sleeve.

But the scene in front of him didn’t change.

There was no hallucination!

This was real!

Old Xu took a deep breath and immediately called the partner.

“The partner was also suffering. Just like Old Xu, he had invested almost all of his wealth into diamonds. He did not expect... ”

He did not expect that diamonds would become cabbage overnight.

He also did not expect that the seemingly unreliable Dr. YC would really lead the human eye in the Diamond Freedom Plan.

“After suffering a huge blow, the partner’s voice sounded weak, “Old Xu, don’t you know? Dr. YC’s aircraft carrier plan has succeeded. They brought back 20 tons of diamonds from Neptune. Soon, China will realize diamond freedom...” ”

Boom!

“Hearing this, Old Xu felt like he was struck by lightning. He felt so uncomfortable that he could not breathe. ”

How could this be?

Ye Sen’s niece had actually succeeded!

Was he really not dreaming?

“Old Xu gulped. “Old Zhang, are you not joking with me?” ”

“”I wish I was joking too!”Old Zhang directly cried out, “If we had known this would happen, we would have sold this batch of goods a week ago! What should we do now? I’ve thrown all my assets into it! Old Xu! What should we do?” ”

Old Xu was no better than old Zhang.

Didn’t he throw all his money into it as well?

“Not only did he throw all his money into it, he had also taken out a huge loan in order to make a profit. ”

PA —

The phone in his hand fell to the ground and shattered into pieces.

He was in a daze.

“After a long while, old XU cried out, “Ahhhhh!” ”

Regret!

Old Xu was very regretful!

He regretted that he did not listen to Ye Sen’s words yesterday.

“If he had listened to Ye Sen’s words, things would not have turned out this way. ”

“After a while, Old Xu picked up his phone again and called ye Sen. He cried bitterly, “CEO Ye, please help me! I know that you definitely have a way to help me!” ”

“Ye Sen sighed, “Old Xu, I already reminded you yesterday. It was you who didn’t take it to heart. Now that the boat has sailed, there’s nothing I can do...” ”

“”President Ye, you can’t just stand by and watch me die, right?”Old Xu continued, “Not only have I lost all my money, but I also owe a loan. I have a family, so please help me!” ”

“Ye Sen thought about it. This old Xu was indeed a good person. In addition, when he almost got into an accident, Old Xu had helped him before. He continued, “How much loan do you owe?” ”

“Five million!”Old Xu said.

“Ye Sen continued, “I’ll lend you the money for the loan. You can figure out the rest yourself.” ”

“Hearing this, Old Xu was ecstatic. “Thank you, President Ye! Thank you! When I rise again, I’ll definitely pay you back double!” ”

“”There’s no need for that. Old Xu, I’m waiting for the Day You Rise Again!” ”

“Old Xu wiped away his tears. “President Ye, thank you!” ”

“At this time, other than Ye Sen, no one else could lend him five million. ”

At the Cen family base.

“Ye Zhuo was sitting in the research room, studying the ice crystals he had brought back from Neptune. ”

“At this moment, CEN he ran in from outside. “Miss Ye! Miss Ye!” ”

Ye Zhuo put down the ice crystal in his hand and raised his eyes slightly. “What’s Wrong?”

“Cen he was so anxious that his forehead was covered in sweat. He continued, “Miss Ye, C Nation has suddenly denied the betting agreement again! The International Notary Office also said that they did not see the contents of the agreement back then!” ”
