“Chapter 1443: 308: Strong and merciless, smacking professor Yue in the face! 1”

Translator: 549690339

No Professor Yue?

How could there be no professor Yue!

“Tang Xue’s face turned pale for a moment, but she quickly recovered. “Then, who is the leader of Your Research Unit?” ”

That person sized Tang Xue Up. “You’re looking for our Professor Ma?”

Professor Ma?

Who Was Professor Ma?

“Tang Xue had been in the base for so long, but she had never known that there was a professor with the surname Ma! ”

What was going on?

What was going on?

“If the leader of the research unit was Professor Ma, what would happen to Professor Yue? ”

Tang Xue tried her best to calm herself down. “Where’s Sun Yu? Ask Sun Yu to come over!”

“”You’re looking for Sun Yu, right? Wait a moment.” ”

“Hearing that Sun Yu was still there, Tang Xue heaved a sigh of relief and nodded. “Sorry to trouble you.” ”

“As long as Sun Yu was still around, it meant that things were definitely not what she had imagined. ”

“Sun Yu had mobilized the entire staff to go on strike. Now that Sun Yu had appeared in the research room, Cen Shaoqing must have given professor Yue an explanation. ”

“You’re welcome.”That person went in to look for her.

Tang Xue was waiting for someone outside.

“About five minutes later, the door was opened again. That person looked at Tang Xue and said, “Sun Yu is a little busy right now. I’ll have to trouble you to wait a little longer.” ”

Tang Xue nodded. “No problem.”

“After saying that, Tang Xue continued, “May I know your surname?” ”

“”My name is Tang Ruye,”the man said. ”

“Tang Xue smiled and said, “What a coincidence. My surname is Tang too. Perhaps we were a family 500 years ago!” ”

“Tang Ruye smiled. “It’s quite a coincidence. Miss Tang, please wait here for a moment. Sun Yu’s side will probably arrive in about ten minutes.” ”

“Alright.”

“After Tang Ruye left, Tang Xue sat on the spot and continued to wait for Sun Yu. ”

“Ten minutes later, the tightly shut door was opened again. ”

“This time, it was definitely Sun Yu! ”

Tang Xue hurriedly stood up from her chair.

“However, when the door was opened, an unfamiliar face appeared. ”

Tang Xue was stunned. “May I ask if Sun Yu is still busy?”

The person who came was also stunned. “I am Sun Yu! Are you that Miss Tang?”

He was Sun Yu?

“However, Sun Yu was clearly a young man in his early twenties. The person in front of him could even be Sun Yu’s father! ”

How Could This Be Sun Yu?

“Tang Xue was a little speechless and said, “What kind of joke is this! Where is Sun Yu? Quickly get him out. Today is not April Fool’s Day! I have business with him!” ”

“”I’m really Sun Yu!”The Man took out his work permit. “Look, this is my work permit!” ”

Tang Xue took the work permit that the man handed over.

Suddenly.

She was stunned!

Sun Yu.

“On this work permit, it said that he was indeed Sun Yu. ”

“But if he was Sun Yu, then where did the real Sun Yu Go? ”

“Sun Yu continued, “May I ask why you are looking for me?” ”

“Tang Xue tried her best to calm herself down and continued, “May I ask, is there anyone here called Wang Qinghe?” ”

“”Wang Qinghe?”Sun Yu scratched her head. “You are talking about the former head of the quality inspection team, Wang Qinghe, right? He is no longer here! Currently, all the members of the research room in Area B have been replaced by people from studio a 2.” ”

The former head of the quality inspection team?

Studio A 2?

Tang Xue was stunned.

What was going on?

Did Sun Yu mean that Professor Yue’s scientific research room had been completely replaced by another group of people? Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

How could that be possible!

No one could replace Professor Yue’s scientific research room.

Where did this a 2 member come from?

Professor Yue’s Scientific Research Room had been replaced by all the members. Why didn’t she hear any news beforehand?

What was going on?

Cold Sweat broke out on Tang Xue’s forehead almost instantly.

“Seeing Tang Xue Like This, Sun Yu asked with concern, “Miss Tang, are you alright?” ”

“”No, I’m fine.”Tang Xue tried her best to smile. ”

“Sun Yu continued, “Then why are you looking for me? If there’s nothing else, I still have other things to do.” ”

“”I, I might have gotten the wrong person! I’m sorry, you, you go ahead and attend to your matters!” ”

“Sun Yu glanced at Tang Xue and felt that this person was rather strange. However, she did not say anything else and turned around to walk inside. ”

Tang Xue walked out of Area B and felt that both her feet were stepping on cotton wool.

It was very surreal.

“Have you heard? Area B has returned to normal order.”

“Master five invited professor Yue Back?”

“No way! Do you think Master Five is the kind of person who can be easily threatened?”

“Then what’s going on?”

“I heard that member a 2 has replaced all the positions in Professor Yue’s research room.”

“Member a 2? There’s such a member in our base?”

“I’m not too sure either. I’ll go ask around after work.”
