Feng Ying also drank it all in one gulp!

“Plum wine was a fruit wine. The alcohol content was not high. It was sweet and carried the fragrance of exclusive plum. The taste was very good. Although one cup looked like a lot, it was not choking after drinking it all. ”

“How does it taste?”The old lady looked up at Feng Ying.

“Feng Ying nodded and said with a smile, “It tastes very good. By the way, Grandma, Can You Give Me the Plain Jade Now?” ”

“”Take it,”the old lady said lightly. ”

“Feng Ying leaned over and picked up the wooden box by the table. Her heart was beating fast. Soon, she would be able to board the plane to C Nation! ”

“From now on, she would be the head of the international fashion department! ”

“Thinking of the scene of her being the head of the department, Feng Ying was extremely excited. ”

“Feng Ying carried the box and walked out. “Grandma, I still have something to do. I’m going out for a while. You Don’t have to wait for me to go home tonight.” ”

“Once she left, she might never come back. ”

It was just a pity that she couldn’t say goodbye to the old lady properly!

“Aren’t you going to open the box to take a look?”The old lady’s voice suddenly sounded in the air.

“Feng Ying stopped in her tracks and opened the lid. When she saw it, she frowned. ”

The box was empty. There was no jade in it!

“Where’s the Jade?”Feng Ying immediately turned to look at the old lady.

“The old lady smiled and looked at Feng Ying. “Xiao Ying, you came back for the Jade, right?” ”

“”Grandma, what are you talking about? I came back for you. What does it have to do with Suyu?”Feng Ying pretended very well. “Grandma, I came back to take care of you. You take care of me when I’m young, and I’ll take care of you when you’re old.” ”

“Really?”The old lady asked.

“”Of course!”Feng Ying continued, “Grandma, tell me, where is Suyu? Don’t joke with me!” ”

“”It’s already so late, and you still care about where Su Yu is. Don’t you care about yourself at all?”The old lady asked. ”

“”Me? What do I care about myself?”Feng Ying walked over. “Grandma, you promised to give me Su Yu. Are you going to go back on your word?” ”

“At this moment, the old lady suddenly vomited a mouthful of blood. ”

“Seeing the old lady vomit blood, Feng Ying’s face turned pale. “Grandma! What’s wrong with you?” ”

“I don’t have a granddaughter like you who betrayed the country and her people!”The old lady pushed Feng Ying’s hand away and became a stranger. “Bastard! You Don’t deserve to be called Feng! You’ve lost the face of the Feng Family!” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Feng Ying looked at the old lady in disbelief.

How did she know?

“”Grandma, you misunderstood?”Feng Ying immediately explained, “It’s not what you think. I didn’t do anything to betray anyone!” ”

“The old lady vomited another mouthful of blood and endured the intense pain in her body, “Do you really think I don’t know anything? Bastard, let me tell you, I heard everything. You want the plain jade? No Way! Even if I die, I won’t give the plain jade to someone like you!” ”

“Feng Ying was a little angry. She had been so good to the old lady, but the old lady had treated her like this! ”

She really did not know what was good for her!

“Let me ask you! where is the plain jade!”Feng Ying’s expression became extremely vicious in an instant.

The old lady only smiled.

“What are you laughing at!”

“The next second, Feng Ying suddenly felt a pain in her abdomen. Then, a sweet smell came from her throat, and she could not help but spit out a mouthful of blood. ”

“Feng Ying wiped her mouth with her hand. When she saw that her hands were covered in blood, she suddenly understood something! ”

It was poisonous!

The wine was poisonous!

“Did you poison me?”Feng Ying questioned the old lady.

“”Yes, I did poison you!”The old lady nodded. ”

“Not only did she poison her, but it was also an incurable poison! ”

“As a grandmother, the old lady couldn’t watch Feng Ying betray her country. ”

“Why?”Feng Ying was close to shouting hysterically. “I am your biological granddaughter! Do you still have humanity?”
