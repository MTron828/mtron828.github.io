Translator: 549690339

“As long as Bai Jingshu had her little sister in her heart, she would not snatch Lin ze away. ”

What right did Bai Jingshu have to point her finger at her now!

“Not only did she make Bai Jingshu’s wedding dress for nothing, she was also going to become the laughingstock of everyone! ”

“In the S Galaxy, who would not laugh at Bai Mo for being blind and having Bai Jingshu make her wedding dress for nothing. ”

“”Who is Lin Ze? Lin Ze is your brother-in-law! Bai Jingshu, can you even do that to your own brother-in-law? Bai Jingshu! You Disgust Me! A person like you should go to Hell. You should be disgraced!”Bai Mo said hysterically. ”

“If it wasn’t for Bai Jingshu, would she have ended up like this? ”

Bai Mo almost vented all of her dissatisfaction towards Bai Jingshu.

“”Bai Mo, wake up. You and Lin Ze never started, so why would I steal him away?”Bai Jingshu said coldly. ”

“If Bai Mo had really been with Lin Ze, Bai Jingshu would never have had anything to do with Lin Ze. ”

But she hadn’t.

They had never started.

Both Lin Ze and Bai Mo had never crossed paths from the start.

Bai Mo’s logic was that of a robber!

“”Bai Jingshu, why do you think you can be together with Lin Ze?”Bai Mo stared at Bai Jingshu with her eyes wide open, “Because of me! If it weren’t for me, you wouldn’t even be able to touch Lin Ze’s side! Do you really think you’re something? You’re just a substitute for me!” ”

“Up until now, Bai Mo had always thought that Bai Jingshu was her substitute. ”

Even though Lin ze had already denied it.

Lin Ze was lying to himself.

“If Lin Ze really didn’t like her, he wouldn’t have chosen Bai Jingshu. ”

It was just that Bai Jingshu couldn’t see reality clearly.

“”Bai Mo, this is just your imagination!”Bai Jingshu looked at Bai mo. “Lin Ze never liked you! Stop lying to yourself.” ”

A mocking smile appeared on Bai Mo’s lips. “Who is the one who is making this up? Who is the one who is lying to himself?”

Bai Jingshu looked at Bai Mo without any expression in her eyes.

She thought that Bai Mo was just unwilling and regretful. She never expected that Bai Mo would make up so much nonsense in his mind.

“In the next second, Bai Mo stood up from the ground. “Bai Jingshu, today, I will make you pay for stealing someone else’s Man!” ”

“”It’s really you,”Bai Jingshu said. ”

“At that moment, Bai Mo had completely lost her mind, “That’s right, it’s me! So what if it’s me? Bai Jingshu, let me tell you, what I Can’t get, You Lowly woman, can forget about getting it as well! Didn’t you think that you were Lin Ze’s most beloved person? I’d like to see if you can still get what you want after that shameful incident!” ”

Bai Mo was so obsessed with revenge that she had lost her mind. She even ignored the discomfort in her body.

“As soon as she finished speaking, Bai Mo clapped her hands. In the next second, the sound of the door opening came from outside. ” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

A few burly men walked in from outside.

“”What do you want?”Bai Jingshu looked at Bai mo. even though she was mentally prepared, she still couldn’t believe it. ”

“They were originally from the same root, so why were they so anxious to fight each other? ”

They were blood-related sisters.

How ruthless was Bai Mo to be able to get to where she was today?

“In the end, it was all because she valued blood-related relationships too much. ”

“Even her biological parents could give up on her completely, not to mention that she and Bai Mo were only cousins. ”

“”What do I want to Do? Guess what I want to Do?”Bai Mo looked at Bai Jingshu like she was poisoned. “Bai Jingshu, do you know how much I hate you? I want to cut you into a thousand pieces!” ”

Bai Jingshu looked at Bai Mo and stood up from the ground.

“At that moment, she seemed to have changed into a different person. She looked down at Bai mo. “Unfortunately, you don’t have a chance.” ”

“What do you mean?”Bai Mo suddenly felt that something was wrong.

“Bai Jingshu’s face curved slightly. “Bai Mo, haven’t you realized it yet?” ”

“Bai Mo took a few steps back, his face slightly pale. “What did you do to me?” ”

It was also at this moment that Bai Mo suddenly felt a strange heat burning in his body.

It was very strange.

That feeling almost made one’s body turn cold.

“He wanted something, but he also wanted to resist something. It was a very scary and eerie feeling. ”

The energy around Bai Mo was also sucked away at this moment. He looked at Bai Jingshu. “What did you do to me? !”

Bai Jingshu’s gaze was very calm. “Don’t you feel that this feeling is very familiar?”
