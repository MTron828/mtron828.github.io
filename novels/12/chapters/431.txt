It was old Mrs. Cen who used her connections to change his choice.

Old Mrs. Lin raised Lin ze single-handedly.

She knew Lin ze too well.

“After the change of choice happened, although Lin Ze didn’t say anything on the surface, it could be seen. ”

He was very angry. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

But Old Mrs. Lin wasn’t at ease with Lin Ze going to the provinces.

She was afraid that Lin Ze would secretly go to Yun Jing to look for ye Shu.

“As long as Lin Ze was in the capital, she could know about Lin Ze’s situation anytime and anywhere. ”

“Moreover, Beijing University was a key university in the world. ”

What other school in China could compare to Beijing University?

“Lin Ze held his bag and belt. “If you want to follow me, then follow me. It’s up to you!” ”

He couldn’t be angry with old Mrs. Lin right now.

He had to follow her.

“Just then, Aunt Zhang ran in from the door. “Old Lady, Miss Qianhua is here with Xianxian.” ”

“Old Mrs. Lin turned to look at Lin Ze. “Ah Ze, let’s go.” ”

Feng Qianhua’s car was parked outside the manor.

It was a very luxurious nanny van.

“Seeing Old Mrs. Lin come over, Feng Qianhua hurriedly got out of the car to welcome her. “Aunt Lin, quickly get in the car. Ah Ze, you and Xianxian sit in the back.” ”

Lin Ze got into the backseat.

“When she saw Lin Ze get into the car, Feng Xianxian greeted him gently, “Brother Ah Ze.” ”

“She had thought that Lin Ze would just ignore her, but who would have thought that Lin Ze would actually acknowledge her. ”

Feng Qianhua frowned.

“It was not a good thing for her that Lin Ze suddenly gave her face, because only Lin Ze’s rebellious and insensible attitude could accentuate Feng Qianhua’s docility. ”

“Feng Qianhua smiled and said, “Ah Ze, please take care of your Xianxian Sister in school from now on.” ”

“Lin Ze turned a page of the book in his hand. “If you’re worried, you can hire a nanny to follow her.” ”

“”Ah Ze, you’re the older brother! It’s only right to take care of your sister! How can you say that?”Old Mrs. Lin reprimanded. ”

Lin Ze did not say anything and continued to turn a page.

“However, the air did not return to silence because of this. Feng Qianhua smiled and continued, “Aunt Lin, ah ze did not do it on purpose. Why are you so calculative with a child?” ”

Old Mrs. Lin once again sighed in her heart at Feng Qianhua’s magnanimity.

Lin Ze was really too heartless.

“He did not want such a good stepmother like Feng Qianhua, but he had to find a promiscuous b * tch like Ye Shu. ”

Feng Xianxian took the initiative to tell Old Lady Lin a joke to make her happy.

The car sped along the road.

...

“On the other side, Ye Shu and Ye Zhuo also arrived at Beijing University. ”

There were many seniors and seniors waiting for new students at the school gate.

“Ye Zhuo had experience from his previous life. There was no need for him to go to the reception for new students at all. He directly brought ye Shu to the academic affairs office to report. Then, there were all kinds of procedures, such as paying tuition fees, medical examinations, and collecting all kinds of information... Finally, he received the key to the dormitory ”

It was already two hours later when he successfully received the key.

Ye Zao brought ye Shu to the dormitory building.

“There were hints along the way, so it wasn’t difficult to find them. ”

Feng Qianhua and old Madam Cen were walking out of the dormitory building with Feng Xianxian.

At this moment.

She suddenly saw a face.

A familiar face.

Who was that?

Ye Shu!

Why would ye Shu appear in the capital?

What the hell was going on?

“Also, who was the girl standing next to Ye Shu? ”

Why did she look so much like ye Shu...

Could it be...

That Was Ye Shu’s biological daughter!

An invisible fear immediately enveloped Feng Qianhua.

How could this be?

What the hell was going on?

How did ye Shu find her biological daughter?

“Feng Qianhua’s face turned white in an instant. Her hands and feet turned cold, and her footsteps felt weak. ”

“Feng Qianqian saw that Feng Qianhua’s expression was not right, so she slowed down and asked in a low voice, “Mom, What’s Wrong?” ”

“Feng Qianhua held Feng Qianqian’s hand tightly. “Qianqian, call me Grandma!” ”

“Ah?”Feng Qianqian was stunned.

Feng Qianhua tried to control her emotions. “Call me! Call me! Remember to speak Louder!”

“Although Feng Qianqian did not know what Feng Qianhua was up to, she still raised her voice and said, “Grandma! Grandma, please slow down. Let me help you.” ”

“Old Mrs. Lin smiled and said, “I don’t need your help. I can walk on my own.” ”

“”There are too many people in the school. Grandma, let me help you.”Feng Qianqian held old Mrs. Lin’s arm. With Feng Qianhua’s words, she deliberately spoke very loudly. ”

“Ye Shu subconsciously looked over. When she saw Old Mrs. Lin’s face, she felt as if she had never seen that old lady before. ”

“When her gaze touched Feng Qianhua beside her, Ye Shu was even more stunned. ”

Who was that?

Why did she look so familiar?

“At this moment, the scene from nineteen years ago suddenly appeared in front of Ye Shu’s eyes. ”

“Nineteen years ago, wasn’t this woman the one with a big belly who came to accuse her of being a mistress? ”

Yes!

It was her!

It was her!

And the old lady beside her.

Was Lin Qingcheng’s mother!

“Although nineteen years had passed, Ye Shu still remembered each and every one of their faces clearly. ”

“Feng Qianhua tried her best to pretend that she didn’t see ye Shu and walked to Feng Xianxian’s side. “Xianxian, there are a lot of people in school. Hold your grandmother carefully.” ”

“”Mom, I know.”Feng Xianxian tilted her head and looked at Feng Qianhua. ”

Mom?

Grandma?

Her daughter called Lin Qingcheng’s mother Grandma.

It seemed.

“They were indeed engaged, but they should be married by now! ”

At this moment.

The thing that ye Shu had been holding onto for so many years collapsed instantly.

So many years.

She had always felt that she was not a mistress.

She had not interfered in other people’s feelings.

But now.

The truth was right in front of her eyes.

“Feng Qianhua was panicking. She did not know if ye Shu had recognized her. She should have recognized her by now, right? ”

“On the other hand, she was afraid that Old Lady Lin would see ye Shu. ”

“After all, Ye Shu had already found her biological daughter back. ”

“If Old Lady Lin saw that the child was not right, she would definitely do a paternity test again. ”

No.

She must not let such a thing happen.

No!

“Thinking of this, Feng Qianhua suppressed the panic in her heart and stood in front of old Mrs. Lin, blocking her line of sight. “Let’s go to Ah Ze’s side to take a look.” ”
