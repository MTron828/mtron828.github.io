“Chapter 721: 160: This is my sister, Ye Zhuo! 4”

Translator: 549690339

“It’s the sixth day of the New Year.”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “Okay.”

“Not long after, the car stopped at the entrance of Jinxiu Manor. The snow was too heavy for the car to drive in. ”

Cen Shaoqing got off the car and sent ye Zhuo in.

“The snow on the road was about 20 centimeters thick. As he stepped on it, it made a creaking sound. Ye Zhuo raised his head and looked at Cen Shaoqing. “Does it snow so heavily in the capital every year?” ”

“Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly and said, “Yes, it’s the same every year.” ”

“Ye Zhuo looked at the snow on the road and a faint light flashed in his eyes. “Cen Shaoqing, close your eyes. I have a gift for you.” ”

Gift?

Cen Shaoqing’s eyes moved slightly and he closed his eyes.

Ye Zhuo squatted on the ground and grabbed a handful of snow. He quickly squeezed it into a ball and stood up. He stuffed it directly into Cen Shaoqing’s neck and ran away.

Cen Shaoqing only realized then that he had been tricked by this person and immediately chased after him.

The two of them got into a mess in the snow.

“For the first time in his life, Cen Shaoqing actually started a snowball fight with a twenty-year-old girl. ”

What was even more terrifying was that he actually found it quite interesting.

“At this moment, it was as if he had become a few years younger. ”

“Half an hour later, the two of them lay on the snow. Ye Zhuo raised his head to look at the sky. ”

“”Cen Shaoqing, are you tired?” ”

Cen Shaoqing raised his eyebrows slightly. “Are you doubting my physical strength?”

Trying to understand a barbell that weighed 300 kilograms?

“A moment later, CEN Shaoqing stood up from the snow. “Get up quickly. It’s too cold in the snow. It’s not good for a girl’s body.” ”

“It’s so comfortable in the snow. Let me lie down for a while more.”Ye Zhuo did not want to get up.

Cen Shaoqing looked at her from above. “Get up quickly. I’ll carry you.”

“Really?”Ye Zhuo turned to look at Cen Shaoqing.

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. He took ye Zhuo’s hands and carried her on his back.

It was much lighter than he had imagined.

Carrying her was like carrying a little bird.

“Although it was very light, there were some parts of it that were turbulent. ”

Cen Shaoqing felt his heart skip a beat as he carried her on his back. He could not help but think of the scene in his dream.

He was very glad that he was carrying ye Zao.

If he was carrying him...

He would be making a fool of himself!

“”Cen Shaoqing, why aren’t you speaking?”Ye Zao asked. ”

“What did I say?”

Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly. “Why is your voice hoarse? Did you catch a cold in the snow just now?”

“”Maybe,”Cen Shaoqing said concisely. ”

“Ye Zao said, “Then you really can’t do it. You’ll catch a cold just like that!” ”

Can’t do it?

He can’t do it?

“He could lift two barbells that weighed 300 kilograms at once, but ye Zhuo said he couldn’t do it? ”

“Cen Shaoqing suspected that ye Zhuo was implying something about him, but he had no evidence. ”

Ten minutes later.

Cen Shaoqing carried ye Zhuo on his back and arrived at the main entrance of the Lin family manor.

“Then I’ll be going back first.”Cen Shaoqing put ye Zhuo down.

“Wait a moment.”Ye Zhuo held Cen Shaoqing’s hand.

His hand was very hot.

The temperature of his palm was almost scorching.

Ye Zao stretched out his hand and touched his forehead. “Do you have a fever?” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Maybe a little.”Cen Shaoqing avoided ye Zao’s gaze.

“Ye Zao continued, “I have cold medicine there. Come back with me. I’ll get you some.” ”

Cen Shaoqing’s body temperature gradually rose. “No need. My body is good. I’ll be fine after carrying it.”

“That’s fine too. Take care to keep warm.”Taking medicine would indeed lower one’s immunity.

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “Then I’ll go back first.”

“If he didn’t go back now, what if ye Zao asked him to take medicine? ”

“”Drive carefully on the road,”ye Zao reminded him. ”

“Okay.”

“After watching Cen Shaoqing leave, Ye Zao turned around and returned to the house. ”

“After Cen Shaoqing got into the car, he opened the refrigerator, took out a bottle of mineral water, and gulped it down. ”

“Although the process of falling in love was wonderful, it was also a physical labor. People with a slightly weaker physical quality really couldn’t stand it. ”

“This month, he had drunk many bottles of ice mineral water and taken many cold showers. ”

Even Cen Shaoqing himself couldn’t remember!

The Cen family.

“After Old Mrs. Cen returned, she called Cen Yuyan to the study on the third floor. “Fourth girl, let me ask you, what is the matter you are handling today?” ”

“What is it?”Cen Yuyan looked at Old Mrs. Cen with a puzzled expression.

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Don’t pretend to be ignorant! Don’t you know what’s going on in your heart?”If ye Zhuo was a little more ordinary today, he would have been trampled under song Chenyu’s feet. ”

“It was the new year, so old Mrs. Cen did not want to quarrel with Cen Yuyan. She could not hold it in today. ”

“After saying that, old Mrs. Cen continued, “Song Chenyu is not someone who is easy to deal with. You are a good friend of her and you will be set up by her sooner or later!” ”
