“”I’m sorry, my sister quit!” ”

“The Boss’s expression was very ugly. “She’s only been working for a week. If she suddenly quit now, she won’t get paid!” ”

“No! We don’t want the pay!”Tang Jia suddenly lost control of her emotions and shouted angrily.

“Zhao Pingting was shocked by Tang Jia. “Sister-in-law, what happened to you? Did Something Happen?” ”

“Tang Jia looked at Zhao Pingting, she said in a hoarse voice, “I know! I know everything! Little Sister, go home with sister-in-law! Sister-in-law will take care of you! Don’t worry, sister-in-law and your brother have saved over a million yuan! It will definitely be enough for you to treat your illness!” ”

Zhao Pingting did not expect Tang Jia to know about this.

She did not expect Tang Jia to say such a thing.

Tang Jia was usually a very stingy person.

She did not want to do her hair.

She did not want to buy her clothes.

She did not want to buy her skin care products. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“She was only in her thirties, but she had managed to live like a 40-year-old woman. ”

She had saved for many years.

They had only saved more than a million...

But today.

“For her, she had actually given all this money to her for treatment. ”

“They usually did not seem to care about each other. In fact, in their hearts, they had already regarded each other as the people closest to them. ”

Tang Jia was even more so.

“In her heart, Zhao Pingting was her younger sister. ”

This family could not live without her.

“Zhao Pingting tried her best to force a smile. “Sister-in-law, I have lung cancer. It’s in the middle and late stages. There’s no hope for treatment. Rather than wasting money, I might as well spend my last days with you guys.” ”

“”It can be cured! It can definitely be cured! You’re still so young. As long as you cooperate with the treatment, there will definitely be hope!”Tang Jia’s face was already covered in tears, “You don’t have to worry about the money. Your brother and I can save over 200,000 yuan a year. Moreover, we still have over a million yuan in savings. This money will definitely be enough for you to cure your illness!” ”

“Zhao Pingting shook her head, “Sister-in-law, listen to me. My illness is a death disease. It Can’t be cured! Even if you forcefully treat it, you’ll only end up with nothing! It will only add to the pain. Don’t tell my brother about this, and don’t tell mom and Dad About It!” ”

“”Mom and dad only have one daughter, and your brother and I only have one sister, and you are the only aunt in Zhuang Zhuang! If something were to happen to you, what do you want us to do? You are not allowed to say anything depressing! Let’s go, let’s go home with sister-in-law!”Tang Jia dragged Zhao Pingting back. ”

“”Sister-in-law, you and my brother’s savings are used to buy a house! You have saved for so many years, I can not drag you down! And I can’t drag down Zhuang Zhuang! I beg you, please don’t tell my brother and my parents about this, okay?”At the end of her sentence, zhao pingting directly knelt on the ground. ”

Zhuang Zhuang was the son of Zhao Yingjun and Tang Jia.

He was five years old this year.

“Now, he was brought by Tang Jia’s mother and was usually sent back once a week. ”

Zhao Pingting did not want to drag the family into a mess before she died.

Lung cancer was a fatal disease.

“Not only was there no cure, but once they were admitted to the hospital, they could not afford the medical expenses at all. ”

It was no different from burning money.

“Tang Jia was also kneeling on the ground, “Little sister, sister-in-law, please don’t give up on yourself when we haven’t given up on you, okay? If the house is gone, you can buy it again. If the person is gone, then it’s really gone! This illness must be treated! Even if we have to sell everything we have! One Million is definitely enough! You Don’t have to worry about money! This isn’t a problem that a child like you should be worried about!” ”

“Sister-in-law!”

“Tang Jia continued, “Come Home with me. Let’s go home together! Let’s go treat the illness, okay?” ”

Zhao Pingting was also in great pain. “It can’t be cured... my illness can’t be cured.”

“Tang Jia continued, “Get up first. I’ll keep it a secret for you.” ”

“Really?”Zhao Pingting looked at Tang Jia in surprise.

Tang Jia nodded. “Really.”

“Zhao Pingting stood up. “Sister-in-law, thank you.” ”

Tang Jia wiped the tears from her face. “Let’s go home.”

“When the two of them returned home, Zhao Yingjun and his parents had already returned. ”

“Zhao Yingjun asked in puzzlement, “What Happened to Tang Jia? Why did you call me and my parents back in such a hurry?” ”

Zhao Pingting’s parents were also puzzled.

“Tang Jia took a deep breath and said, “I have something to announce to all of you.” ”

“What is it?”Zhao Yingjun asked.

“Realizing what Tang Jia was going to announce, Zhao Pingting’s eyebrows jumped and she hurriedly pulled on Tang Jia’s sleeve. ”

“”Sister-in-law, don’t say it! Please! You promised me not to say it!” ”

“”I have to say this!”Tang Jia turned to look at the three people in the room. “Dad, Mom, handsome, my little sister is sick and has advanced lung cancer.” ”
