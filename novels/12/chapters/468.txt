“Zy did not have a membership system. Even a big star like song Chenyu had to follow Zy’s rules. If she wanted to buy clothes, she could only rely on luck and luck. ”

“Cen Yuyan was so touched that she hugged song Chenyu. “Chenyu, thank you.” ”

“You’re a good friend.”Song Chenyu patted Cen Yuyan’s back.

“CEN Yuyan said, “You’ll still be my sister-in-law in the future.” ”

“Song Chenyu said very seriously, “Fifth master has a girlfriend now, so I can’t do immoral things. So, Yuyan, you’d better not say such things in the future.” ”

“Cen Yuyan said, “What’s there to say! You’re clearly the one who first got to know my fifth brother. If we really want to pursue the issue of morality, the truly immoral person should be ye Zhuo.” ”

“If it wasn’t for ye Zhuo, the person who would end up with Cen Shaoqing would definitely be song Chenyu. ”

“Song Chenyu was beautiful, generous, and accomplished. It was impossible for CEN Shaoqing not to be attracted to her. ”

“But now fifth master’s girlfriend is indeed Miss Ye. We have to respect Miss Ye.”

“Cen Yuyan shrugged. “If ye Zhuo can think like you, then the person by my fifth brother’s side right now would definitely be you.” ”

Everyone said that the entertainment industry was a big dye-in-the-wood.

“However, CEN Yuyan did not think so. Song Chenyu had been in the industry for more than three years, but she was still so kind-hearted and had a righteous outlook on the world! ”

She had earned the glory she had today all by herself. She had never needed to rely on anyone.

How was she like ye Zao?

She even had to rely on Cen Shaoqing to give her a gift.

“Song Chenyu did not reply and only said, “It’s already late. Why Don’t you stay with Me Tonight?” ”

“Sure!”Cen Yuyan could not wish for more.

...

On the other side.

At the sanatorium.

“After reading the diary yesterday, Lin Jincheng’s condition had suddenly worsened. He was currently receiving an infusion. ”

His left hand was receiving the infusion while his right hand was flipping through the documents.

“After settling all the official matters, the words appeared in front of Lin Jincheng’s eyes again. He rubbed his temples and raised his hand to press the bell. ”

“The assistant quickly walked in from outside. “Director Lin, do you have any orders?” ”

“Lin Jin Cheng continued, “Go and call secretary Zhang over.” ”

“”Yes, director Lin.”The assistant immediately went to do it. ”

“When Secretary Zhang received the news from his assistant, his mood was very complicated. ”

He knew why Lin Jin Cheng called him over.

It was because of that matter.

He was the only person who Lin Jincheng trusted.

But now.

He wanted to lie to Lin Jincheng with Old Lady Lin.

“But now, he had no other choice but to do so. ”

Secretary Zhang Sighed.

“Soon, they arrived at the hospital. ”

“Lin Jincheng sat on the bed, holding the notebook in his hand, his expression empty. ”

“Chief Lin.”

It wasn’t until Secretary Zhang spoke that Lin Jincheng reacted. “Secretary Zhang.”

“”Director Lin, why did you call me here?”Secretary Zhang asked. ”

“Lin Jincheng was silent for a moment before he continued, “Secretary Zhang, tell me, are all these things in the diary real?” ”

“Secretary Zhang nodded. “Yes, when your memory had problems in the past, you also took this diary to read.” ”

“Ah Ze’s mother is really Feng Qianhua?”

“Yes.”Secretary Zhang nodded.

“Feng Qianxian is really my daughter?”

“Yes.”

“”I really let down Feng Qianhua, and that’s why the mother and daughter suffered so many years?”It was written in the diary. Because of a misunderstanding, Lin Jincheng and Feng Qianhua broke up. ”

Feng Qianhua waited for Lin Jincheng for nineteen years.

“But in these nineteen years, Lin Jincheng was indifferent and even cheated on her. ”

“Yes.” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Lin Jincheng looked at secretary Zhang and said, “Secretary Zhang, the only person I can trust right now is you.” ”

“Secretary Zhang took a deep breath and tried his best to suppress the guilt in his heart. “CEO Lin, what I said is true. This diary was written by you personally.” ”

Lin Jincheng frowned.

He was the one who wrote this diary.

But why was the content so unfamiliar to him.

“Lin Jincheng continued, “My memory has always been intermittent. Is it possible that I wrote these wrong memories because there were errors in my memory?” ”

“”I’m not too sure about that either,”secretary Zhang replied. ”

“Lin Jincheng pressed his temples. “Other than you, is there anyone else who has this diary?” ”

Secretary Zhang shook his head. “I should be the only one who knows about this.”

“Lin Jincheng continued to ask, “Does the old lady know?” ”

“”She probably doesn’t know,”secretary Zhang said. “Apart from the holidays and festivals, you rarely go home, so the old lady rarely knows about your situation.” ”
