Ye Zao picked up his phone. “Let me check.”

“A moment later, ye Zao continued, “Sister De Ning’s sister is staying in Ward P036.” ”

“Really?”Ye Sen asked.

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly. “You should go now!”

Ye Sen walked out.

“”Uncle, wait a moment,”ye Zao suddenly said. ”

Ye Sen stopped and looked back. “What’s wrong with Zao Zao?”

Ye Zao picked up the fruit basket on the side. “Take this.”

“”Zao Zao Zao, you’re the most thoughtful one.”Ye Sen took the fruit basket. ”

“Soon, they arrived at Ward P036. ”

Ye Sen stood in front of the ward and suddenly felt a little nervous. He subconsciously tidied up his tie and hair before reaching out to knock on the door.

“Soon, the door was opened. ”

The person who opened the door was really gu dening.

“Seeing ye Sen, gu dening was very surprised. “Brother Ye, why are you here?” ”

“Ye Sen smiled and said, “I’m going to be discharged today, so I’m here to see Big Sis.” ”

“Come in quickly.”Gu dening turned sideways to let ye Sen in.

“Who’s Here?”Gu Dexin’s voice came from the ward.

“GU dening said, “Sister, it’s brother Ye.” ”

“It’s Xiao Ye!”Gu Dexin came out of the wheelchair. “So what if you’re here? Why did you bring anything? You’re not an outsider!”

Ye Sen was a little embarrassed by her words. “It’s a token of my appreciation.”

“GU dexin continued, “Dening, why aren’t you pouring tea for Xiao Ye?” ”

“Okay.”Gu dening walked over to make tea.

“Ye Sen said, “No need to trouble me. I’m not thirsty. I’m just going to be discharged soon, so I came to see Big Sis! Big SIS, Are You Alright Now?” ”

“Gu dexin smiled and said, “I’m fine, I’m going to be discharged soon too!” ”

“That’s good.”

“GU dexin continued, “Xiao Ye, please sit down.” ”

Ye Sen sat on the sofa.

“Gu Dexin saw that Ye Sen was not bad and wanted to set him up with Gu Dening. She continued, “Xiao Ye, I heard from Dening that you’re starting a business in Beijing now. Will you be settling down in Beijing in the future?” ”

“”Yes.”Ye Sen nodded. “My sister and the others are all in Beijing, so I’ll settle down here in the future.” ”

“”Beijing is indeed a good place.”Gu dexin continued, “I’ve lived in Beijing for more than 30 years.” ”

“Big Sister also bought a house in Beijing?”Ye Sen asked.

“Gu dexin smiled and said, “My wife is from Beijing!” ”

“I see!”

“Gu dexin then asked, “I heard from dening that you don’t have a good relationship with your parents’side?” ”

Ye Sen nodded and didn’t deny it. “Yes.”

“Can you tell me what’s Going On?”Gu Dexin asked.

“Since she wanted to set gu dening and Ye Sen up, she needed to find out about ye Sen’s family situation. ”

“Sure.”

Ye Sen briefly told her about his relationship with the Ye family.

This included ye Shu cutting off her finger in anger.

Gu Dexin was terrified when she heard this.

“She was a happy person. When she was at home, her parents loved her a hundred times. When she got married, her in-laws treated her very well. ”

She didn’t expect such parents to exist in the world.

Gu Dexin sighed. “Your sister is also a courageous person.”

Cutting off a finger?

How could an ordinary person do such a thing? !

“Ye Sen smiled and said, “The person I admire the most in my life is my sister.”Although ye Shu’s personality was a little weak in the early stages, she had grown up in the later stages. ”

“If she hadn’t cut off her finger and intimidated those people from the ye family, they would probably still be entangled by now! ”

“Gu dexin looked at ye sen. “Xiao Ye, let me ask you a question.” ” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“”Please Ask,”ye Sen said. ”

“Gu Dexin looked at Gu Dening, who was preparing the medicine, and asked in a low voice, “What do you think of our De Ning?” ”

“Hearing that, Ye Sen’s ears turned a little red. “De, De Ning is a very good girl.” ”

“Then do you like her?”Gu Dexin continued to ask.

Do you like her?

“Ye Sen didn’t expect Gu Dexin to ask so directly. For a moment, his ears turned even redder. ”

“After a long while, Ye Sen finally nodded. “I, I like it.” ”

“Gu dexin smiled and said, “If you like it, then go and chase after it!”! It just so happened that our De Ning is also quite interested in you. It’s just that girls are thin-skinned, so I’m embarrassed to say it. You’re a man, so you can’t be timid.”As someone who had experienced it before, gu Dexin really didn’t want Gu De Ning to lose a good man like ye Sen. ”

“Firstly, they were both interested in each other. ”

Secondly.

What relationship was the most difficult to deal with now?

“Of course, it was the mother-in-law relationship! ”

“But if gu dening married ye Sen, she wouldn’t have to face the mother-in-law relationship. ”
