“Chapter 1685: 351: There’s no way to advance, no way to retreat, and they’re going to massacre everyone! 3”

Zou Feifei had seen too many young girls taking selfies around their Bentley.

“Especially those who were somewhat beautiful like ye Zao, they were even more vain! ”

“Lin Sha shook her head. “No need, my friend drove here.” ”

Drove?

What kind of car could a young girl like Ye Zao Drive?

Not the shared car next to him!

He was not afraid of losing face.

“Zou feifei smiled and said, “In that case, we’ll go back first.” ”

“Goodbye.”Lin Sha held ye Zao’s arm and walked to the parking spot.

“The next second, the smile on Zou Feifei’s face froze. ”

“Ye Zao actually took out the car keys, opened the door of the Lamborghini, and then sat in the driver’s seat. ”

Lin Sha also sat in the passenger seat.

How could this be? Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

This Lamborghini worth 200 million RMB was actually ye Zao’s?

What was Ye Zao’s identity?

How could she drive such a luxury car?

“Ning Lan, who was at the side, was also a little stunned. ”

“They were still guessing who this luxury car belonged to a second ago, but in the next second, Ye Zao and Lin Sha got into the car. ”

“After a long while, Ning Lan turned to Zou Feifei. “Feifei, who do you think that Ye Zao is? She can’t really be Dr. YC, right?” ”

“”Absolutely not!”Zou feifei continued, “This car might be rented by ye Zao to show off!” ”

“Didn’t those socialites who risked their lives like renting luxury cars, renting luxury watches, and taking photos to show off? ”

“Therefore, Ye Zao’s car must have been rented as well! ”

She wanted to use this method to seduce a rich man.

How Shameless!

“Zou Feifei originally thought that the name of a fake socialite existed on the Internet, but she did not expect to meet such a fake socialite in real life. ”

It was quite disgusting.

Ning Lan gulped. “But this kind of luxury car can’t be rented at all.”

“After the big shots bought the limited edition luxury car, they would put it in their collection. How many of them would be willing to put it in the car rental company and let others drive it? ”

“Do you want to say that this car is ye Zhuo’s own?”Zou feifei turned to look at Ning Lan.

Ning Lan nodded. “It’s possible!”

“”What a joke!”! “Ye Zhuo is a third-year girl. How could she afford such a luxury car!”Zou feifei said, “Even if she didn’t rent it, it must be from a shady background! “She’s so beautiful. There should be many men who are willing to rush to give her things!” ”

Beauty was the most advantageous weapon.

Ye Zhuo’s face could definitely be said to be exquisite.

“Ning Lan nodded. “That’s true! She’s so beautiful. As long as she speaks, someone will be able to satisfy her.” ”

“At the end of her sentence, Ning Lan sighed. “It’s great to be beautiful! I would be satisfied if I could be as beautiful as her.” ”

“Ning Lan was born into a wealthy family. Her academic results were not bad, but her looks were too ordinary. ”

“She also wanted to get a scalpel, but she was afraid of pain. Moreover, there were so many cases of plastic surgery failures. If she lost her life, it would not be worth it. ”

“”What’s so good about it? It’s just flesh and blood.”Zou feifei was very disdainful of such things. He continued, “When she gets old, there will be a few men who will be willing to talk to her.” ”

“Ning Lan felt that what Zou Feifei said made sense. She continued, “I don’t Know How Lin Shasha became such a good friend!” ”

“Zou feifei said, “Birds of a feather flock together. Lin Shasha, that old woman, is already so old, yet she still came to participate in the college entrance exam. She wants to give herself a layer of gold so that she can marry into a wealthy family in the future!” ”

“”Why do you have to participate in the college entrance exam just because you marry into a wealthy family?”Ning Lan asked, puzzled. ”

“Zou feifei continued, “Which Rich family would accept a girl who didn’t even graduate from middle school?” ”

“After all, Lin Sha was just a little gangster before this. ”

“After that, zou feifei continued, “And I heard from my mom that Lin Sha found a boyfriend and got pregnant. She even talked about getting married. In the end, she felt that the man was too poor and couldn’t afford the betrothal gifts, so she aborted the child and broke off the engagement!” ”

“Really?”Ning Lan asked in surprise.

“”Of course! I’ve seen that man before! His name is Zhang Qiang. Just Like Lin Shasha, he is also an illiterate who didn’t even graduate from middle school!” ”

“Ning Lan was surprised, “I didn’t expect Lin Shasha to be this kind of person. I think she is quite good-looking, and she speaks gently. I thought she was quite good! I didn’t expect people to be so secretive!” ”

“That’s why you can’t judge a book by its cover.”

“Ning lan nodded and continued, “Fei Fei, what are you going to do about the college entrance exam tomorrow?” ”
