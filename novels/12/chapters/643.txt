“However, ever since seeing the calligraphy and paintings sent by his old friend, he felt that none of the calligraphy he had seen before was called calligraphy. ”

Only those two pieces of calligraphy were truly calligraphy!

“After a moment, master Yu put down Feng Xianxian’s calligraphy. “It’s not bad.” ”

Who Was Master Yu?

He was someone who stood at the top of the literary world.

“Feng Xianxian was already very happy to receive a sentence from master Yu saying, ‘it’s not bad’! ”

It seemed that there was no need to worry about finding a master.

“Old Lady Lin was just about to continue with this sentence when master Yu continued, “Why don’t I see Fourth Brother Jin City? I heard that Jin city has found their long-lost daughter. Old Sister-in-law, get someone to call Jin city’s family of four over.” ”

Old Lady Lin originally did not want ye Zhuo to see Master Yu.

Ye Zhuo wanted to be well-behaved and had no manners. What if he offended Master Yu?

“But since master Yu had said so, Old Lady Lin could not refuse. “Butler, go and call Jin city’s family of four over.” ”

“Okay.”The butler nodded.

“Old Lady Lin looked at master Yu and continued, “Jingshan, my granddaughter came from a small place and doesn’t know the rules. If she offended you in any way later, please forgive her.” ”

Master Yu only thought that Old Lady Lin was being modest.

“Not long after, Lin Jincheng and ye Shu brought Lin Ze and ye Zao over. ”

“Master Yu!”

“Master Yu had always admired Lin Jincheng. When he saw Lin Jincheng coming over, he immediately stood up and said, “Jincheng.” ”

“Lin Jincheng continued to introduce master Yu, “Master Yu, this is my wife, Ye Shu. This is my daughter, Ye Zao...” ”

“Just as he was about to introduce Lin ze, master yu smiled and said, “I know this person. This is Ah Ze! When I came here eight years ago, Ah Ze was still a child! I didn’t expect him to turn into a young man in the blink of an eye!” ”

Ye Zao looked at Master Yu Like This.

He frowned slightly.

“Master Yu’s face looked rosy, but in fact, he had a sickly aura. The cold air invaded his body, and he looked very unwell. ” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Lin Ze greeted him politely, “Grandpa Yu.” ”

“”Good! Good!”Master Yu continued, “Jin City, your children are both dragons and phoenixes among men!” ”

Dragons and phoenixes among men?

Feng Xianxian bit her lip when she heard this. Her eyes flashed with dissatisfaction.

What kind of dragons and phoenixes were ye Zhuo and Lin Ze?

She should be the real dragon and Phoenixes among men!

“At this moment, master Yu, who was still talking, suddenly went limp and fell to the ground, unconscious. ”

Everyone present was shocked.

No one had expected master Yu to suddenly faint.

“Master Yu’s assistant was even more anxious. The old man had not been feeling well recently and would fall ill every few days. However, he had already taken his medicine when he left the house this morning. He had not expected him to faint now. ”

The assistant quickly took out the medicine that he had brought with him and fed it to master Yu.

“You can’t give this medicine to him.”Ye Zao immediately took the medicine bottle from the assistant’s hand.

“The assistant was stunned. He raised his head to look at Ye Zao. “Miss Lin! Our Old Man’s illness is very serious. Please return the medicine to me quickly! Otherwise, if something happens, you won’t be able to take responsibility!” ”

“Ye Zao ignored the assistant’s words. He placed one hand on Master Yu’s pulse and the other hand took out his earphones from his pocket and put them on his ears. “Xiao Baibai, bring my acupuncture bag over!” ”

“Master Yu suddenly collapsed, and Ye Zhuo added to the mess. Old Madam Lin panicked and hurriedly said, “Ye Zhuo! Hurry up and return the medicine to Assistant Ma!” ”

“This wild girl, how could she not have the slightest discernment? ”

“Ye Zhuo raised his head and looked at Old Madam Lin. “This medicine has nothing to do with Master Yu’s illness. Not only will it treat the symptoms but not the root of the problem, it will also make master Yu’s body worse and worse! This one will take his life!” ”

“At that moment, a servant immediately ran over to deliver the acupuncture bag. ”

“Ye Zhuo took the acupuncture bag, picked up a silver needle, and inserted it into Master Yu’s acupuncture point. ”

“Seeing this, assistant Ma was shocked and hurriedly stopped ye Zhuo. “Miss Lin! What are you doing?” ”

Ye Zhuo continued to insert the needles. “I’m saving Master Yu.”

Saving Master Yu?

Just ye Zao?

She could save Master Yu?

It was simply a fantasy!

“Seeing this scene, Feng Xianxian seemed to have heard a huge joke. ”

Who did ye Zao really think she was?

“Even if she did not succeed in becoming Master Yu’s disciple today, she would not feel any pity because ye Zao had become a murderer. ”

Who Was Master Yu?

The literary world’s Great Big Dipper.

He had caused the death of Master Yu.

“Even if Cen Shaoqing made a move, he probably would not be able to protect ye Zao. ”

“Old Lady Lin was about to die from anger from ye Zao. “Lin Jincheng, why don’t you take care of your daughter! Do you want her to cause the death of our entire family?” ”
