“Mario touched the head of the exotic beast symbolically before continuing, “How much longer until the perpetual motion machine is ready?” ”

The exotic beast blinked its eyes.

“Three days?”Mario asked.

“Hearing this, the exotic beast blinked again. ”

“Mario continued, “If I don’t see the perpetual motion machine in three days, I’ll turn you back into a single-celled organism.” ”

“Hearing these words, the exotic beast was so frightened that its entire body was trembling. ”

Mario’s eyes were filled with satisfaction.

“After so many days of research, Mario had long since grasped the ins and outs of the exotic beast. ”

“Although this exotic beast wasn’t afraid of anything, potassium carbonate was its nemesis. As long as the potassium carbonate was sprinkled on its body, the Beast’s reminder would shrink by a fold. And so on. As long as the amount of potassium carbonate was sufficient.., the exotic beast would change from its current appearance into the most primitive single-celled creature. ”

“Therefore, as long as he firmly grasped this point, he would be able to control the exotic beast, allowing it to use the energy within its body to create the perpetual motion machine that he wanted. ” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Of course, what Mario wanted was far from just the perpetual motion machine. ”

“He even had the ambition to dominate the world. After all, the energy of the exotic beast was endless. ”

“However, when Mario was feeling pleased with himself, he didn’t notice that a complicated expression flashed across the Strange Beast’s eyes. ”

This kind of expression wasn’t something that a strange beast should have.

“The moment the assistant raised his head, he happened to see this scene. His heart trembled, and an inexplicable fear ignited in his heart. ”

“”Bo, Doctor...”the assistant stammered. ”

Mario turned around impatiently. “What’s Wrong?”

“The assistant continued, “It, it seems to be a little, a little abnormal...” ”

It was extremely abnormal. It was just a strange beast. How could it have such a gaze.

“Mario asked impatiently, “What’s abnormal about it?” ”

“”Its, its gaze is abnormal.”The assistant looked at Mario. “Doctor, its gaze is too terrifying! Let’s hurry up and destroy it!” ”

“Hearing these words, Mario’s anger rose from the bottom of his heart. It was fine if others didn’t believe him, but now the assistant didn’t believe him either ”

“Scram! Get Out of my base right now!”Mario pointed outside and said.

“The assistant was very anxious, because he really saw it. “Doctor, Listen to me. I really saw it just now. It’s definitely not a creature that we can control!” ”

That gaze of his instantly caused the assistant to think of two words.

Disaster.

Ye Zhuo was definitely not scaremongering!

Mario did not allow anyone to doubt him at this moment. He immediately sent people over to pull the assistant out.

The assistant was left outside the experimental base. He was stunned for a long time before he seemed to have thought of something. He immediately stood up and ran in the direction of his home.

“Today was the last day that other countries would open to lzhou. If he missed this day, he would never be able to leave the island again. ”

There were still three hours before the exit would open.

He had to gather all his family and friends within three hours and leave Lzhou immediately.

“With this thought in mind, the assistant quickly ran to the parking lot and sped all the way home. ”

“Just as the car stopped outside the house, he saw his mother and sister fixing the lawn. ”

“”Jerry! Why are you back at this time?”When his mother saw Jerry’s car, she immediately put down the lawn mowing machine and quickly trotted forward. ”

“Jerry got out of the car and said as he walked, “Mom, Hurry up and pack your things with your sister. We’ll set off immediately! I’ll call the others!” ”

His mother was a little puzzled. “What’s wrong? Where Are We Going?”

Why did he suddenly want to leave.

Jerry didn’t have time to explain to his mother. “You go pack your things first. Pack all the important things. We’ll set off in half an hour.”

“His mother wanted to ask more questions, but Jerry’s sister, Amy, came over and said, “Mom, let’s go pack our things First!” ”

“Jack worked in the laboratory base in L continent, so he knew a lot of things that ordinary people didn’t know. Now that Jerry suddenly wanted to leave, he must have his own reasons. ”

“Okay.”His mother nodded and followed Amy to the room.

“When Jerry came to the room, he sent a group message to his family and friends about leaving l continent. He was worried that they wouldn’t be able to see him, so he called them one by one to inform them. ”

“While he was on the phone, Jerry didn’t stay idle either. He started to pack up his things. ”

“There were too many things. He couldn’t bring everything with him, so he had to bring his valuables with him. ”

“Half an hour later, Jerry arrived at the door. His mother and sister had already packed up everything and put it into the commercial car. ”
