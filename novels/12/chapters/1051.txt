Chapter 1052: 233: Scorch Attack! V587! 1

Translator: 549690339

Zhao Pingting curled up in the iron cage. A sense of despair overwhelmed her and her entire body was trembling.

What should she do?

What should she do now?

“At this moment, a strong shadow was cast on Zhao Pingting. She only felt that a malicious gaze was staring at her. ”

That gaze seemed to want to swallow her whole.

Crack —

The lock on the iron cage was opened.

“Before Zhao Pingting could react, her hair was grabbed by someone. A strong force came and pulled Zhao Pingting out of the Iron Cage. ”

“After Zhao Pingting was pulled out of the iron door, the other three women in the Iron Cage looked terrified. They covered their mouths and whimpered softly, afraid that their voices would alert the violent man. ”

Zhao Pingting’s hair was grabbed by the man and she was forced to look up at him.

“The man was about 30 or 40 years old. He was bald. After taking off his glasses and hat, he looked like a different person. ”

Wasn’t this the car-hailing driver?

Zhao Pingting instantly reacted.

There was something wrong with that cup of milk tea!

No wonder she felt dizzy after drinking the milk tea.

“If she had known this would happen, she definitely wouldn’t have drunk that cup of milk tea. ”

“Recalling the disappearance of the female college student and the case of dumping the body, Zhao Pingting panicked and instantly burst into tears. “Let me go, Please...” ”

She couldn’t die.

She couldn’t die.

She hadn’t graduated from college yet.

She hadn’t found a boyfriend yet.

She hadn’t repaid her parents for raising her.

She had even made plans with ye Zhuo and an Lizi to visit Nanhai during the winter vacation...

“Thinking that she would never see her parents again, her brother and sister-in-law, Ye Zhuo and an Lizi, Zhao Pingting felt worse than death. ”

This kind of torturous feeling could not be described with dull words.

Perhaps only those who had experienced it could empathize with it.

The bald man’s already gloomy face became even gloomier when he heard Zhao Pingting’s crying. He increased the strength in his hands and glared at Zhao Pingting. “Who told you to Cry? Don’t Cry!” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Zhao Pingting sobbed twice and tried hard to control herself, but tears kept falling uncontrollably. ”

“”B * Tch! Don’t Cry! If you cry again, I’ll kill you. Do you believe me?” ”

The man grabbed Zhao Pingting’s hair and threw her to the ground.

Bang —

Zhao Pingting’s limbs and bones were in intense pain.

But the pain on the outside was nothing compared to the fear in her heart.

“The bald man stood there and looked down at Zhao Pingting. Then, he began to unbutton his shirt. ”

PA —

The two clothes were thrown to the ground casually.

“After Zhao Pingting realized what he was doing, she placed her hands on the ground and quickly retreated. ”

“”No, no... come here.” ”

The bald man approached Zhao Pingting step by step.

In the next second.

Rip!

Zhao Pingting’s shirt was torn off.

“Seeing the man approaching her, Zhao Pingting’s hand touched the side. ”

“Just as Zhao Pingting was in despair, her hand suddenly touched something cold. ”

It was a steel pipe!

“Zhao Pingting took a deep breath, grabbed the steel pipe in her hand, and swung it at the Bald Man’s Head! ”

Bang.

“Instantly, the Bald Man’s head was bleeding. ”

The bald man did not expect Zhao Pingting to suddenly make such a move. His wide eyes were filled with disbelief before they were replaced by anger.

“At the same time, the three women in the steel cage were also stunned. ”

“They had been in here for so long, but this was the first time they had seen anyone dare to resist this bald man! ”

“This time, it would be great if they could beat this pervert to death! ”

“Taking advantage of the Bald Man’s stunned state, Zhao Pingting quickly stood up and ran out. ”

“Because the bald man had just entered, the door was open. ”

“At this moment, Zhao Pingting used all her strength. ”

“As long as she took out this door, she would be free. ”

The women locked in the cage also looked at Zhao Pingting’s figure with Hope.

Run Faster!

Run Faster!

“As long as Zhao Pingting ran out, they would be saved. ”

“Zhao Pingting ran closer and closer. Just as she was about to run out of the door, someone grabbed the back of her head! ”

“B * Tch! You’re still chasing me away! I told you to run! I told you to run!”The bald man grabbed Zhao Pingting’s hair with one hand and hit Zhao Pingting’s abdomen with the other hand.

Again and again.

It hurt.

It was very painful.

It was as if her internal organs had been torn apart.

Zhao Pingting felt that she could die at any moment. Blood trickled down from the corner of her mouth.

“However, the bald man still showed no signs of stopping. He seemed to have lost control. “B * Tch! I’ll beat you to death! I’ll beat you to death, you B * Tch!” ”
