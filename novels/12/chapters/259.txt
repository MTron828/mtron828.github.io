The announcement from Peking University was released.

The entire internet was boiling!

No one expected that the official account of Peking University would suddenly jump out and slap their faces in public!

“Heaven-toppling, earth-shattering, purple-gold hammer 1225: [ ahhhhh! ! ! I’m so excited! The official account has come out to protect the weak! I knew that leaf didn’t know how to p-map! This face slap feels so good! ] ”

That Dog: [ I Love Beijing University! ]

“Gentle assailant 2021: [ F * CK, F * ck? ! This is the official account? ? ] ”

“Pop Girl: [ fake official account, right? ] ”

Melody User 20215987423: [ I’m Giao! It’s the real official... ]

“Burning Acacia 695: [ so, YC is the real top scorer? ] ”

Beijing University V replied: [ don’t doubt it! God Ye is the true top scorer! ]

This comment was instantly liked to the top of the comments.

“It received a total of 150,000 likes! ”

[ why do I feel that the official account is a bit like Ye’s brain-dead Fan? ]

“[ confirmed the look, it is ye’s fan! ] ”

“Beijing University immediately replied at the bottom of the comments, [ be more confident! Little Editor is a ye fan! I, Ye Shengshi, am beautiful, V587! ] ”

No one would have thought that the official account of Beijing University was actually ye Zhuo’s fan.

“After learning that Beijing University immediately came out to clarify things for her, Ye Zhuo immediately issued a statement in response to Beijing University. ”

Sitara? YC’s ye: “Thank you for liking it. See You in Beijing in two University v.”

Ye Zhuo’s popularity was really too high.

“As soon as this reply was sent out, it immediately received hundreds of thousands of likes. ”

The hot searches on the entire platform were all done by her.

Jingcheng University V: [ Ah Ah Ah! My Goddess has replied me! I’m going to have a face-to-face with my goddess! ]

The comments section was very exciting.

[ wake up! You Can’t break your cool persona! You have to remember that you are the official name of Jingcheng University [ Dog Head ]]

[ my official ID is like a fake id... ]

[ covering my mouth and crying ] I’m envious. I also want to have a face-to-face with the goddess. ]

[ YC is really amazing! She’s beautiful and talented. I’m a fan of this streamer! ]

“[ ye Zi’s old fans all know that Ye Zi didn’t rely on her face to get famous in the first place! If it weren’t for some people who maliciously smeared ye Zi as the princess of magnificent Tang, Ye Zi wouldn’t have shown her face until now! ] ”

“[ I, Rong, don’t know how to improve myself, but I only know how to smear our ye Zao! This kind of person is really too disgusting. ] ”

Those who doubted that ye Zao was a P chart account instantly disappeared.

“For a moment, Mu Yourong became the ridicule of the entire internet. ”

She was slapped in the face instead of being slapped in the face.

The onlookers were so excited that they all ran to Mu Yourong’s account to scold her.

[ you are a scheming B * TCH. Evaluation Complete! ]

[ My Rong will always be a black sheep! ]

[ get out of the live streaming world. ]

[ Miao Yin has a live streamer like you. She is simply a disgrace to the platform! ]

“[ how disgusting! She is not outstanding, yet she still wants to smear others. I am not a fan of ye shuang or Rong Shuang. She is just a passerby. I really can’t watch this anymore! ] ”

[ Shameless! ]

[ ... ]

“Looking at these unsightly comments, Mu Yourong was so angry that her face turned pale and her entire body was trembling. ”

She had originally wanted to use this opportunity to make ye Zao’s reputation tarnished and unable to recover.

She did not expect the situation to turn out like this!

“In the end, the person whose reputation tarnished and unable to recover turned out to be her. ”

What right did ye Zao have?

Mu Yourong had originally suspected that ye Zao had been reborn.

“At this moment, this thought was becoming more and more intense. ”

After all.

“In her previous life, Ye Zao was just a pitiful worm that she had squashed to death. ”

Why was ye Zao so powerful in this life.

“Not only did Mu Yourong suspect that ye Zao had been reborn, she also suspected that ye Zao had a system. ”

“Moreover, Ye Zao’s system was definitely more powerful than hers. ”

“Otherwise, why would she always lose to ye Zao? ”

This simply did not make sense.

Mu Yourong was furious to the extreme. She casually picked up the Teacup on the table and slammed it onto the ground. “Does ye Zao also have a system?”

“The system replied, “I checked last time and found that ye Zao does not have a system. To be precise, out of China’s 1.3 billion people, only you, the host, are the chosen one.” ”

“”Only I have a system?”Mu Yourong narrowed her eyes, ”

[ yes. ]

“Mu Yourong narrowed her eyes. “But if ye Zhuo didn’t have the system, how could she have gotten the first place in the city?” ”

“[ host, I’ve already told you to study hard before the college entrance exam! The system can only help you get fifth place. If you study hard before the college entrance exam, we can work together and not let ye Zhuo get first place! ] ”

Mu Yourong frowned.

She had been very confident in herself.

“After all, in her previous life, she had obtained excellent results in the college entrance exam. ”
