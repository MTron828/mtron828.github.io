“At this moment, the granny walked over and asked with a smile, “Little Guo, what are you looking at?” ”

“Little Guo said, “I’m looking at my sister in front of me.” ”

“After a while, little guo continued, “Granny, Sister is really beautiful! I’ve never seen anyone more beautiful than sister!” ”

It was as if the whole world had descended.

The granny nodded. “I’ve never seen her either.”

“”Granny, do you think I’ll be as good-looking as sister in the future?”For a child of Xiao Guo’s age, the future was what she looked forward to the most. ”

What would she become in the future?

“”Sure, Definitely.”The granny smiled and said, “Our Xiao Guo will definitely be as beautiful as Miss Ye.” ”

“Really?”Xiao Guo’s eyes lit up.

“”Of course it’s true,”the granny said very seriously. ”

“Xiao Guo was very happy. He stood up from the deck and said, “I’ll go get some fruits for my brothers and sisters to eat.” ”

“Go ahead.”

There were many tropical fruits in the South China Sea that were not available elsewhere.

“Xiao Guo carried a plate full of cut fruits and walked to Cen Shaoqing and Ye Zhuo. “Brothers and sisters, it’s a hot day. Eat some fruits.” ”

“After saying that, Xiao Guo added, “Don’t worry, there’s no charge for this!” ”

“After saying that, little guo placed the fruit plate on the table. ”

“Ye Zhuo raised his eyes slightly. “Little Guo, thank you.” ”

“”Sister, you’re too polite.”Little Guo continued, “Sister, try this egg fruit. This is something that can not be bought outside. It’s very delicious.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. He took the egg fruit that little guo handed over and took a bite.

“If it was crisp and sweet, it was very refreshing. If he ate the greasy food, it would be amazing. ”

“Is it good?”Little Guo looked at ye Zao with anticipation.

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “It’s very good.” ”

“Little Guo was very happy to receive ye Zao’s affirmation. “Sister, if you like it, I’ll go get it for you!” ”

“Ye Zao was about to say that there was no need, but little guo had already turned around and ran far away. ”

“The people here are really warm.”Ye Zhuo turned to look at Cen Shaoqing.

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “They are indeed very warm.”

“Not long after, Little Guo ran over with the egg fruit. “Sister, take it.” ”

“”Thank you, Little Guo.” ”

“Little Guo said a little embarrassedly, “You’re welcome.” ”

A young girl at this age really hoped to receive the approval of the person she liked.

Ye Zhuo’s approval was something that could make her happy for the whole day.

“”Xiao Guo, come here.” ”

“Ah?”Xiao Guo was stunned.

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “Stand beside me.” ”

Xiao Guo walked to ye Zhuo’s side shyly.

Ye Zhuo took off the crystal clip by his ear and put it on Xiao Guo’s head. “This is for you.”

“Under the sunlight, the crystal clip emitted a colorful light. ”

It was especially dazzling.

“Xiao Guo quickly took off the crystal clip on her head. “Sister, I can’t accept such an expensive thing from you!” ”

“This crystal clip was obviously expensive. She had only given ye Zhuo a plate of fruit, how could she accept such an expensive thing. ”

“Ye Zhuo said, “It’s not expensive. It’s just a clip, unless you don’t like it that I’ve worn it before.” ”

“Little Guo naturally didn’t dislike it. She liked this crystal clip very much. Because she liked it, she even peeked at it a few times. “Sister, I didn’t mean that. I just feel that...” ”

“”Since you don’t dislike it, then keep it.”Ye Zhuo picked up an egg fruit. “Take it as a return gift from the egg fruit.” ”

“”Thank you, Sister!” ”

“”You’re welcome.”Ye Zhuo took a bite of the egg fruit and then asked, “By the way, aren’t you going to school?” ”

“Today was a working day, and it was not summer yet. Logically speaking, Xiao Guo should have appeared in class. ”

“Speaking of this, Xiao Guo smiled and said, “I just passed the jump exam, and the teacher gave me a week of marriage!” ”

“Then you’re very good!”Ye Zhuo said.

“Xiao Guo said a little embarrassedly, “Thank you, Sister. Grandma called me. I’ll go over first.” ”

“Go.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

Xiao Guo jogged toward the cabin.

“Soon, the fishing boat started to set off. ”

“Not long after, they arrived at an unknown shoal. ”

“Xiao Guo ran over and said, “Brother and sister, the tide has just subsided. It’s really a good time to rush the sea. I know a place that usually has a lot of goods. I’ll take you there.” ”

“Okay.”

Xiao Guo led the way in front while ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing followed behind.

“Soon, they arrived at the secret base that Xiao Guo had mentioned. ” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Xiao Guo continued, “Brother and sister, you guys search here. I’ll go over and help Granny and the others!” ”

“”Then be careful,”ye Zhuo instructed. ”
