He ziteng was stunned. He looked at Cen Shaoqing and then looked down at himself. He suddenly felt a little inferior.

Other people took off their clothes because of their ABS and Merman lines.

But he took off his clothes because he was fat...

“Indeed, comparing people was infuriating ”

“At this moment, Cen Shaoqing suddenly noticed he ziteng standing at the door. He raised the barbell and said, “Why are you here?” ”

“He was very strong, and the barbell did not seem to weigh much in his hands. ”

It was light.

“He ziteng said, “Fifth brother, didn’t we agree that we’re going to meet my idol today?”He could not wait to race with his idol! ”

“CEN Shaoqing said calmly, “It’s only eight o’clock now.”They had agreed to meet at 10:30. ”

“He ziteng continued, “Don’t we still need time on the road? It’s my first time meeting my idol, so I can’t be late.” ”

Cen Shaoqing looked at He ziteng. “The Winding Mountain Road is nearby. It’s a 10-minute drive. We can leave at 10 o’clock.”

“”OH.”He ziteng nodded. “Then my brother, I, will work out with you now! Fifth Brother, let me try this thing!” ”

Cen Shaoqing raised the barbell and looked down at him. “Can you do it?”?

Can You?

One had to know that men were most afraid of this question.

“He ziteng said, “Why can’t I do it! Brother Five, don’t look down on me! It’s just a barbell, what’s wrong with it!” ”

Cen Shaoqing put the barbell on the ground. “You try it?”

“He ziteng rubbed his hands. “Brother Five, you really underestimate me! I can lift ten barbells like this in one breath. If you don’t believe me, I’ll show you now!” ”

Cen Shaoqing raised his eyebrows slightly.

He ziteng held the barbell with both hands. He couldn’t say the rest of his words.

F * ck!

This barbell was too heavy!

“He ziteng gritted his teeth and used all his strength, but he still couldn’t lift the barbell. ”

“At first, he thought that the barbell wasn’t heavy. After all, Cen Shaoqing had always looked as if he was floating. ”

He didn’t expect it to be so heavy!

“He ziteng looked up at Cen Shaoqing. “Fifth brother, how heavy is this barbell?” ”

Cen Shaoqing picked up a towel and slowly wiped his hands. His tone was extremely light. “It’s not that heavy. It’s only about 300 pounds.”

“”300,300 pounds?”He ziteng gulped. ”

It was already 300 pounds.

This was not heavy?

He did not understand the world of big shots!

“Soon, it was 10 o’clock. ”

The two of them set off on the winding mountain highway.

“In order to facilitate the car race, CEN Shaoqing drove a modified Lamborghini Gallardo today. ”

The model was very cool!

He ziteng also drove his own chariot.

“Ten minutes later, the two of them arrived at the intersection of the Winding Mountain Highway. ”

It was only 10:15 now.

Ye Zhuo had not arrived yet.

“He ziteng was especially excited to see his idol soon. “Fifth brother, do you think I’m handsome today? How’s My Hair? Does this outfit of mine still fit?” ” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Cen Shaoqing pinched the prayer beads and looked at him. “It’s not a blind date, why are you so excited?” ”

“Looking at the pretentious he ziteng, Cen Shaoqing suddenly regretted helping him ask ye Zao out. ”

He didn’t know why.

It just didn’t feel good!

His heart seemed to be blocked by something.

“”But that’s my idol!”He ziteng continued, “I have to leave a good impression on my idol, don’t I? Brother Five, tell me quickly, how is it?” ”

“Cen Shaoqing sized he ziteng up and down, his thin lips opened slightly, “It’s Lame! Very lame! It’s all over your body. Also, you didn’t wash your hair last night, right? I saw Dandruff!” ”

“Hearing this, he ziteng’s expression changed, “Fifth brother, don’t Scare Me!” ”

“I never lie.”Cen Shaoqing continued counting the Buddhist beads.

“He ziteng wanted to rush back to wash his hair, but it was too late now, and his expression was extremely dispirited. ”

“If he had known earlier, he would have washed his hair this morning! ”

“At this moment, a black Ferrari approached from afar. ”

“It’s here.”Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips opened slightly.

“My Idol is here?”He ziteng’s eyes lit up.

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“While they were talking, the Ferrari stopped in front of the two of them. ”

“The car door was opened. The first thing that came into view was a long leg wearing Martin boots. Looking up from this leg, he saw that she was wearing a black t-shirt with tassels at the hem, a fair and slender waist was faintly discernible among the tassels. ”

One could not help but want to push away the tassel to see what was going on.

“She wore a pair of black sunglasses on her palm-sized face, leaving only her exquisite chin and high nose bridge. ”

She looked like she was 1.8 meters tall!
