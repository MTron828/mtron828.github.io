Chapter 2162: 445: This is what it means to be bold and unyielding! 2

Translator: 549690339

Who is the shameless one?

Laughable!

This is simply laughable!

“Feeling the gazes from all directions, duanmu Feng and Ru Feng lowered their heads and quickly walked out. ”

Man Xing sat in the guest seats and looked at Ye Zao on the stage with narrowed eyes.

What happened today also exceeded her expectations.

She had also suspected ye Zao’s identity.

But she did not expect that ye Zao was really ye Zao.

“Most importantly, she had investigated ye Zao’s identity. ”

Ye Zao was just an ordinary earthling from head to toe. How did she suddenly turn into Miss Ye?

What exactly happened in between.

She had wanted to watch a good show.

Who would have thought that it would end up like this.

“Man Xing turned the ring on his index finger, but no expression could be seen on his face. ”

“In Man Xing’s plan, Duanmu Feng and Ye Zao would definitely ruin the family recognition banquet today, making it impossible for ye Zao to step down. ”

“After all, Duanmu Feng and Ye Zao’s connections were not fake. ”

“However, even if Duanmu Feng and ye Zao ruined the family recognition banquet, she would not be able to smoothly become the legitimate fiancée of Dongli’s young master. ”

“Since the young master of Dongli had decided to announce ye Zao’s identity in a high-profile manner, it meant that ye Zao held a high enough position in his heart. ”

Duanmu Feng’s actions would only result in a situation where both sides would suffer heavy losses.

This was a situation where both sides would suffer heavy losses. This was also what man Xing was most willing to see.

“When the Snipe and clam fought, the fisherman would always be the one who benefited. ”

“However, in this way, she did not see anything other than a good show. ”

Man Jiangshan was also extremely surprised.

“However, unlike man Xing, there was more surprise than surprise. ”

Ye Zhuo was Miss Ye.

That meant that ye Zhuo was man Xing!

“If ye Zhuo was man Xing, didn’t that mean that he was the father-in-law of Young Master Dongli? ”Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“In the future, the Alliance and MAN XING would be linked. ”

“At that time, in the s galaxy, who would dare to look down on man Xing? ”

Good!

This was great!

“MAN Jiangshan never dreamed that this full moon, which he had once abandoned and which master Cao had determined to be a jinx, would one day become the fiancee of the young master of the eastern fence of the alliance. ”

“However, man Jiangshan did not reveal his worries. ”

He had to find a suitable opportunity to expose this matter.

“After the banquet ended, man Jiangshan stood at the door and waited for man Jiangshan. ”

“Not long after, he saw man Jiangshan and his friend walking out while chatting and laughing. ”

“Dad.”Man Xing immediately went up to greet them.

“Man Xing was wearing a champagne-colored gown. Standing under the night sky, he was like a bright star. ”

“When his friend saw man Xing, he was stunned. ”

“Man Jiangshan took the initiative to introduce him, “This is my daughter, man Xing. Xing ‘er, this is Uncle Zhou.” ”

“”Hello, Uncle Zhou.”Man Xing greeted him politely. ”

“Zhou weiguo smiled and said, “Miss Man is indeed as well-read and reasonable as the rumors say. She is beautiful and beautiful.” ”

But well-read and reasonable? Beautiful and beautiful?

“If he had not met Ye Zhuo, Zhou Weiguo would definitely have added that a woman was not inferior to a man. ”

It was a pity.

“With a gem in front of him, even an outstanding person would not be able to stir up any waves. ”

“”Uncle Zhou, you flatter me. Actually, I’m just a very ordinary girl,”said man Xing. ”

“Zhou Weiguo said, “Miss Man is too modest. Mr. Man, I still have something to do. I’ll take my leave first. If there’s a chance to go to the W Galaxy, I’ll definitely treat you to tea.” ”

“”Okay, I’ll definitely go.”Man Jiangshan cupped his fists at him. ”

“After Zhou Weiguo left, man Xing continued, “Dad, this time, aren’t you going to acknowledge your eldest sister?” ”

“”Of course, I have to acknowledge her!”Man Jiangshan continued, “Not only do I have to acknowledge her, but I also have to acknowledge her in a high-profile manner! I want to announce to the world that ye Zhuo is my daughter!” ”

“Hearing this, man Xing frowned slightly. “Dad, you’re thinking too simply.” ”

“Before man Jiangshan could say anything.., mAN XING continued, “Actually, when I saw her picture before, I suspected that she was elder sister! I also investigated her information, but according to the information, Ye Zhuo was just an ordinary earthling. Do you know what it means?” ”

“If it was not for that information, man Xing would not have been so careless. ”

This was the first time that man Xing had been set up by someone.

And it was completely undetectable.

This made man Xing unable to adapt to it.

“What does it mean?”Man Jiangshan asked.

“MAN XING continued, “It means that elder sister doesn’t want to recognize us at all! She tried every means to create these nihility data just to break away from us.” ”

“Hearing this, man Jiangshan’s face was slowly turning black. ”

Break away from him?

Ye Zhuo was his daughter!

His blood flowed in his body.

He did not repay the kindness of raising her.
