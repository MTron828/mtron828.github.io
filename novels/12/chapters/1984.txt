Plain jade...

Ye Zhuo was stunned.

He suddenly remembered that plain jade was the heirloom that old lady Feng Shujing had given to her.

Old Lady Feng Shujing had said before that the C nation’s scientific research community had always wanted plain jade.

“After Old Lady Feng Shujing left, Ye Zhuo had also studied plain jade, but he had not been able to analyze the valuable energy within it. ”

Could it be that the Jade had other secrets?

“You mean the jade given by Old Lady Feng Shujing?”Ye Zao turned to look at Cen Shaoqing.

“Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “Country C has always wanted the jade because it contains a special energy, becoming the main chip in the Perpetual Motion Machine.”Before he saw the interstellar shuttle, cen Shaoqing was not sure if this was true. ”

Until he had just studied the interstellar shuttle.

To travel from one galaxy to another galaxy required a large amount of power source materials.

“Without the perpetual motion machine, it was impossible to complete this operation. ”

“With the Suyu, he could make the perpetual motion machine. Once the interstellar shuttle was successfully developed, it could instantly kill an aircraft carrier that was faster than the speed of light. ”

An aircraft carrier could freely travel through the Milky Way.

“If it was beyond the Milky Way, the aircraft carrier’s power raw materials would not be able to sustain it. ”

“It seemed like it would only take an instant to surpass the speed of light, but in fact, it required a large amount of nuclear reactor raw materials. ”

“However, an interstellar shuttle with a perpetual motion machine was different! ”

“Once country C developed an interstellar shuttle, it would regain its position as a technological powerhouse. ”

“At that time, country C would join forces with a few other countries, and China would completely lose its right to speak in the scientific research community. ”

“As soon as he finished speaking, CEN Shaoqing continued, “Is the plain jade with you now? Bring it over and try it.” ”

“”The plain jade is at the base.”Ye Zhuo continued, “I’ll go back and get it right now.” ”

“I’ll go with you.”Cen Shaoqing followed ye Zhuo’s footsteps.

The two of them boarded the aircraft carrier.

“Half an hour later, the aircraft carrier landed in the sky above the base. ”

“The aircraft carrier turned on its shielding mode, and the clouds in the sky looked no different from the other clouds. ”

Ye Zao came to the office and took out the plain jade.

“The plain jade was in a mahogany box with carved flowers. The plain jade was green and transparent, no difference from normal jade. ”

“This is the plain jade.”Ye Zao handed the plain jade to Cen Shaoqing. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Cen Shaoqing reached out to take it. He studied it and pursed his thin lips.

“How is it?”Ye Zao asked.

Cen Shaoqing looked back slightly. “Let’s go back first.”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Not long after, the two of them returned to Mars. ”

“Cen Shaoqing placed the plain jade on the interstellar shuttle’s device. In a flash, he pressed the start button. ”

The interstellar shuttle did not respond.

Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly.

Ye Zhuo’s red lips opened slightly. “What’s going on?”

“Don’t be anxious.”Cen Shaoqing took out the plain jade and studied it carefully. “C nation has been scheming so hard to obtain the plain jade. This means that there’s a big secret hidden in the plain jade.”

“Since it was a big secret, it wouldn’t be discovered so easily. ”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “You’re right.”

“At this moment, Cen Shaoqing’s phone rang. ”

Cen Shaoqing took out his cell phone and his eyes changed slightly.

“What’s Wrong?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “I think I found the wreckage of my father’s shipwreck.” ”

Cen Shaoqing’s father had been in a shipwreck for many years.

“All these years, he had never been able to find the shipwreck or the remains of the shipwreck. Now that there was finally news of the shipwreck, Ye Zhuo was happy for him. “Really?” ”

“Yes.”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Then go back and take a look. I’ll be fine as long as I’m here.” ”

“”Okay.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly and handed the Jade to Ye Zhuo. He then said, “I’ll be back right away.” ”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

Cen Shaoqing returned to the Cen family base.

“In the office, the assistant had been waiting for him for half an hour. ”

“Hearing the footsteps, the assistant was so frightened that he immediately stood up straight. ”

“”Master Five,”the assistant said respectfully. ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “Where is it?”

“Here.”The assistant handed him a box with both hands.

“Cen Shaoqing took the box and opened it. He found a rusted ship wreckage inside. Judging from the shape, it should be a part of the bottom of the ship. ”

“Back then, the shipwreck was a large ship that could hold more than 1,300 people, so the parts were much larger than ordinary ships. ”

There was also a code printed on the parts.

HG001989.11.12.

This code was the only proof that it was part of the shipwreck.

“Where did you find this?”Cen Shaoqing looked back at his assistant.

“The assistant continued, “On a resort beach. This part was found by a five-year-old child from y nation.” ”
