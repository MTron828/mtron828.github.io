Man Wen went straight to Siyu Pavilion.

“After all, he was the son of Man Jiangshan, and Zhao Dan was currently a VIP of Chang Yue country. No one could stop him, so man Wen went all the way to Ye Zhuo’s office. ”

“”Excuse me, Are You Miss Ye?” ”

“Ye Zhuo was sorting out documents. When he heard that, he looked up. “You are?” ”

“Man Wen straightened his back and said, “I’m man Wen, and I’m also man Xing’s only younger brother! Let me tell you! Man Xing is my only elder sister. Apart from her, I don’t recognize anyone else. Don’t even think about joining our family, and don’t even think about becoming our elder sister!” ”

“Ye Zhuo stood up with a smile on his face. “Don’t worry, no one wants to be your elder sister. I’m Ye Zhuo, born and raised in changyue. It has nothing to do with man Xing.” ”

“”Alright! You are the one who said that!”Man Wen nodded, then, he said, “Do you dare to swear? If you return to Manxing, you are not a human! This young master will say it here today. If anyone dares to threaten my elder sister’s position, I will teach them a lesson! Don’t think that this young master is trying to scare you!” ”

Man Wen’s face was filled with unwelcome and disapproval. The way he looked at Ye Zao was as if he was looking at an enemy.

“Ye Zao did not answer him. Instead, he said, “If there’s nothing else, please leave.” ”

“”I asked you if you heard me!”Man Wen glared at Ye Zao. “I won’t allow anyone to steal my sister’s things! I Don’t care who you are, Miss Ye or Miss Shu!” ”

“Ye Zao tapped his fingers on the desk. He was not angry at man Wen’s words. His face was calm. “Are you done, Mr. Man?” ”

Man Wen was stunned.

“He did not expect ye Zao’s reaction to be so calm. He puffed out his chest and said, “So what if I’m done? So what if I’m not done?” ”

“Ye Zao continued, “Mr. Little Man, don’t worry. I’m not interested in your family’s matters. Ye Zao is ye Zao. He will always be ye Zao.” ”

“”You better remember what you said today! If you dare to go back on your words, I will kill you!”Man Wen waved his fist at ye Zao ”

Ye Zhuo didn’t say anything and made a ‘please’gesture.

Man Wen turned around and walked out.

“When he reached the door, he turned back to look at ye Zhuo and warned, “If you’re sensible, you’d better behave yourself, Miss Ye! Manxing country isn’t a place you can go just because you want to! It’s also not a place where you can get a share!” ”

Only after saying this did man Wen really turn around and leave.

“Just as man Wen left, Ye Han chased after him. ”

“Ye Han!”Ye Zhuo called out to Ye Han.

“Sister!”Ye Han turned back.

“What are you going to do?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“Ye Han said, “I’m going to teach that kid a lesson! If I don’t teach him a lesson, he’ll think that only Manxing has a younger brother!” ”

Did he think that his younger brother was dead? He dared to openly bully his sister?

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “Forget it, don’t lower yourself to his level. Actually, from a certain point of view, he’s a very good little brother.” ”

“”Forget it, I can’t forget it!”Ye Han rolled up his sleeves. “Sister, don’t bother about this matter! I’ll be back right away!” ”

“Ye Zhuo couldn’t stop ye Han, so he could only let him go. ”

“This was man Wen’s first time coming to Chang Yue country. He was filled with curiosity about everything in Chang Yue country, so he naturally didn’t want to go back. Just when he was having fun, a violent pain came from the back of his head, and then his vision went black, he fainted just like that. ”

Ye Han dragged man Wen to a blind spot in the surveillance camera and splashed a basin of cold water on him to wake him up.

“The Moment Man Wen opened his eyes, he found himself tied to a pillar. At first, he thought it was raining, but then he realized that the man standing in front of him was holding a basin in his hand. ”

“”Who are you! What do you want! You Dare to kidnap me! Do you know who I am?”Man Wen struggled angrily. “I’m warning you, quickly release me! Otherwise, my father won’t Let You Go!” ”

“”Now You’re Scared?”Ye Han directly punched man Wen. “When you were flaunting your power in front of my sister, you didn’t think about this? What, are you bullying me because I don’t have a brother?” ”

Man Wen was stunned!

His sister?

Who was his sister?

“”Are you F * cking sick! Did you find the wrong person! Release me quickly, or I’ll make your life worse than death!” ”

“”Do you believe that I’ll Make Your Life a Living Hell Now?”Ye Han gave man Wen a few more punches, but before he could even hit his face, the punches landed on an invisible area. It was extremely painful. ”

“Man Wen was in so much pain that his facial features were twisted together. “It hurts, it hurts, it hurts! Who Are You? ! No, who is your sister? Have I ever offended her?” ”

“”Ye Zao! Your Sister Is Ye Zao, Right?”At this moment, man Wen suddenly remembered something. ”

“”Do you really think that my sister wants to go to your Manxing Kingdom? A family of disgusting things! If you dare to appear in front of my sister again in the future, I will directly cripple you!”As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Han directly gave man Wen the last punch. ”

“The power of this last punch was too great, directly knocking man Wen unconscious. ”

“After ye Han finished his work, he brushed his clothes, blew on his fist, and turned around to board the aircraft. ”

On the other side.

“After ye Zhuo had finished preparing the document for the Zen, he immediately issued an announcement. ”

“The moment this announcement was issued, the entire country was in an uproar. ”

“No one had expected that ye Zhuo, who had finally returned to the public’s sight after much difficulty, would leave again at this time. ”

Manxing country.

“Before Manjiangshan could finish reading this announcement, he directly threw the cup on the ground and smashed it into pieces. “Vile daughter! Vile daughter!” ”

Ye Zhuo actually handed over the changyue kingdom to Ye Han without saying a word. Where did she place this father of hers? !

“The changyue kingdom should be surnamed man. No matter what, it was not ye’s turn to be in charge. ”
