“”Doctor Wang, it’s normal for people to have doubts.”Ye Zhuo took out Vivi’s examination report, “But I can be responsible to tell you that Vivi’s illness is malaria. Her current condition is very serious. If she doesn’t have the surgery in time, her life will be in danger at any time.” ”

“”Miss Ye, I only told Vivi about my doubts. As for who Vivi chooses to believe, that’s her problem. It has nothing to do with me.” ”

“Doctor Wang continued, “Miss Ye, to tell you the truth, I have also prepared a set of examination plans for Weiwei.” ”

“Moreover, doctor Wang had already revealed this matter to the media every day. Very soon, the media would report this matter. ”

“As long as the surgery was successful, he would be able to prove himself to the whole world! ”

“If he could surpass ye Zao, then he would be able to compete equally with ye Zao in the medical world. ”

“”Stupid!”Ye Zao’s red lips parted slightly, and a sullen expression appeared on his face. “Wang Dajun, do you know that your stupid idea will cause the death of a young and fresh life? !” ”

“Doctor Wang looked at Ye Zao. “Miss Ye, facts speak louder than words.” ”

“After saying this, doctor Wang turned around and left. ”

Ye Zao frowned without leaving a trace.

“This matter was quickly found out by the hospital director. The hospital director was furious and immediately went to find doctor Wang. “Doctor Wang, What’s wrong with you? Do you know that you’ve caused a huge disaster? !” ”

“Doctor Wang looked at the director. “Director, I’m just insisting on what I think is right.” ”

“”Doctor Wang, I think that you’re an elder of the hospital. This time, I’ll ask Miss ye not to be calculative with you. Quickly go and explain the matter to the patient!” ”

“”Director, this time, all of you are wrong.”Doctor Wang continued, “Don’t you think that the current situation is very similar to the scene when Miss ye cured cancer back then?”Back then, Ye Zhuo had also been questioned by many people, however, ye Zao still persisted. ”

“Without ye Zao’s persistence back then, how could he have his current success? ”

“The current him was just like ye Zao back then. He faced many doubts. If he gave up now, there would be no future him. ”

“It was the same for ye Zao. If ye Zao had directly given up back then, there would be no present ye Zao. ”

“Are You Miss Ye? Do you have Miss Ye’s ability?”The director asked. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Doctor Wang looked at the director. “Director, don’t forget that Miss Ye was just a high school graduate.”A teenager could cure cancer, so why couldn’t he create a second miracle? ”

“The director looked at Doctor Wang. “Wang Dajun, wake up!” ”

“”Director, I’m very clear-headed now,”Wang Dajun continued. “I know what I want to do.” ”

The director frowned. “You don’t have to come to work tomorrow.”

“”Director, it might be too late,”Wang Dajun looked at director Han and said. ”

“He had not made any major mistakes. The director had no right to stop him from coming to work. Moreover, he had already reported this matter to the media. Under the suppression of public opinion, more and more people would support him. ”

“Most importantly, the patient himself also trusted him. ”

Hospital director Han looked at Doctor Wang. “What do you mean by this?”

“Doctor Wang smiled and said, “Don’t worry. You’ll know.” ”

“At that moment, his assistant walked in from outside the door. “Hospital director Han.” ”

“What’s Wrong?”Hospital director Han looked up at his assistant.

“The assistant continued, “There are reporters outside who want to interview you.” ”

Reporter?

Director Han frowned slightly and looked up at Doctor Wang.

“Doctor Wang continued, “Like I said, it might be too late.” ”
