“Chapter 1640: 345: Trash, Tang Xue is expelled from the base. 1”

“Miss Ye!”

The audience stood up from their chairs and cheered.

Some even cried with joy.

The blood in the audience was boiling.

No one expected the aircraft carrier to suddenly appear in the sky.

“Dr. Cara, Dr. Tina, and the others were especially stunned when they saw the aircraft carrier in front of them. ”

“How, how could this be? ”

Didn’t Ye Zao and the Others Die on Neptune?

Why would they suddenly appear here?

An illusion!

It must be an illusion!

“Neptune was not only a gaseous planet, but its conditions were also very harsh. Apart from the diamond rain, the strongest hurricane in the solar system was already unbearable. How could ye Zao and the others have a chance of survival? ”

“Furthermore, ye Zao had clearly been attacked on Neptune previously. ”

“Neptune was different from Earth. Even if a diamond were to hit it, it was possible for it to die immediately! ”

Dr. Cara pinched his thigh hard.

It was a heart-wrenching pain.

It was real.

It was not an illusion!

“Dr. Cara turned to look at Tina. Tina also looked at Dr. Cara in disbelief. “Dr. Cara, what do we do now?” ”

“Wait and see!”Dr. Cara narrowed her eyes.

“In this situation, there was no other way except to wait and see. ”

What if it was not ye Zao who came back?

“As long as ye Zao was not here, everything would be easy. ”

“Okay.”Tina nodded.

“In a flash, a flight of stairs hundreds of meters long appeared from the aircraft carrier and connected to the ground. ”

A slender figure walked out of the cabin.

“Against the light, although it was hard to see her face clearly, her aura was so strong that people couldn’t even catch up to her. The boundless light behind her became her background. ”

The camera captured this scene accurately.

It was different from the stage camera.

“The live broadcast camera was full HD without any image or filter. This kind of camera was also used as a death camera by industry insiders. However, under this kind of camera, no one could see any flaws in her. ”

[ Dad! ]

[ y dad V587! ]

“[ Ahhh! ! ! I’m so excited, I’m Crying! ] ”

[ YC dad is so handsome! ]

“Then, the screen was filled with [ y dad V587! ] ”

“Then, Dr. Warne, the river, Lake, and sea brothers, as well as Tang Mi and Yu Zifei, walked out and followed behind her. ”

“When they landed on the aircraft carrier, there were eight people, and when they returned to Earth, there were still eight people! ”

Cen Shaoqing just looked ahead with a faint smile on his face.

A moment later.

Cen Shaoqing stood up from his seat and walked forward.

“”Brother Five, here.”He ziteng stuffed a bouquet of flowers to Cen Shaoqing, his eyes slightly red. ”

“After losing contact with the ground from the aircraft carrier for a few hours, he ziteng’s heart started to race, afraid that something might happen to ye Zao. ”

Fortunately.

“Fortunately, everything was safe and sound. ”

Cen Shaoqing took the flowers and continued to walk forward.

Everyone’s eyes followed his steps and moved forward bit by bit.

In a moment.

Cen Shaoqing stopped in front of ye Zao.

Ye Zao also stopped.

The two of them just stood there and looked at each other.

“Cen Shaoqing handed the flowers to her and opened his thin lips. His deep voice sounded in the air, “Miss Ye, welcome back.” ”

“Ye Zao took the flowers with both hands and smiled. “Mr. Cen, How Have You Been?” ”

CEN Shaoqing’s fingers brushed across ye Zao’s palm. They were numb and numb as if they had been electrocuted. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“At this moment, silence prevailed. ”

“After a moment, Cen Shaoqing turned to look at the others behind ye Zao. “Dr. Hua En, you’ve worked hard!” ”

Everyone gave Cen Shaoqing a big smile.

“Dr. Hua en took a step forward and said, “It’s not hard at all. It’s our honor to follow Miss Ye to Neptune.” ”

“If it were not for ye Zao, they might never have been able to set foot on Neptune in their entire lives. ”

“After all, the fastest speed of an aircraft was only 54,000 kilometers per hour. ”

“At this speed, humans would have to wait at least two hundred years before they could reach Neptune. ”

This was also the reason why no one believed that ye Zao could create a flying machine that could surpass the speed of light.

Surpass the speed of light.

“These four words sounded simple, but in reality, it was even more difficult than ascending to the heavens. ”

“However, not only did ye Zao achieve it, he even completed it beautifully. ”

It was a huge slap to the faces of all the countries!

“Even without looking, one could tell that the expressions of professor Cara and the other five countries’leaders were definitely very interesting. ”

“They originally wanted to see China become a joke, but they didn’t expect to lose so much face in front of the global audience. Before this, country C had always been a technological power, but after tonight.., they might not be able to keep the title of technological power. ”
