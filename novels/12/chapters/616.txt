“Chapter 617: 147: publicly flaunting their love, envying others, and revealing the truth! 3”

“A promise is a promise!”Duan Duan quickly answered.

“Looking at it this way, the legendary fifth Cen didn’t seem that scary. ”

Everyone in the Lin family heaved a sigh of relief.

“After introducing everyone in the Lin family, Ye Zhuo took Cen Shaoqing and sat down at the chairman’s seat. ”

Feng Xianxian sat opposite Cen Shaoqing.

“Tonight, she had to perform well and snatch Cen Shaoqing back from ye Zhuo. ”

“Feng Xianxian picked up the cup and drank a mouthful of water, suppressing the strange expression on her face. ”

“After sitting down, Cen Shaoqing picked up the cup again and toasted everyone. ”

“Other than the five children on this table, Cen Shaoqing had the smallest seniority. He was also the new future son-in-law of the Lin family. At this moment.., if he didn’t stand up and offer a toast, it wouldn’t make sense. ”

“There were many people in the Lin family. There were more than 20 elder brothers and sisters-in-law. After this round of toast, Cen Shaoqing’s face was slightly red. ”

Ye Zhuo picked up a piece of pork elbow and placed it into Cen Shaoqing’s bowl. “Don’t drink.”

That was pork elbow?

Feng Xianxian narrowed her eyes.

Cen Shaoqing had been a vegetarian for many years.

Ye Zhuo actually dared to give cen shaoqing meat dishes.

Isn’t this too old to move the earth?

Ye Zhuo really thinks who he is!

Does she think CEN fifth master loves her very much?

She doesn’t have the slightest self-awareness!

Giving meat dishes to vegetarian people is a big taboo.

Just wait and see.

Cen Shaoqing will definitely change his face in the middle.

Only she is the most suitable for CEN Shaoqing.

In order to let Cen Shaoqing see that she was a vegetarian.

Feng Xianxian specially picked up some green leafy vegetables.

The hearts of the other members of the Lin family also thumped.

It was not a secret that Cen Shaoqing was a vegetarian. Ye Zhuo’s action of picking up his elbows was indeed somewhat inappropriate.

“Who knew that in the next second, Cen Shaoqing picked up his elbows and ate them. ”

Ate Them?

CEN fifth master was not a vegetarian anymore?

“Seeing Cen Shaoqing eat the pig knuckle with a normal expression, the Lin family members all looked somewhat incredulous. At the same time, they also heaved a sigh of relief. ”

The power of love was truly great!

“For the sake of love, Cen Shaoqing actually broke the rules that he had kept for so many years. ”

Feng Xianxian’s face turned pale.

Didn’t they say that Cen Shaoqing was a vegetarian?

Why did Cen Shaoqing start eating meat again now?

Feng Xianxian instantly felt as if she was chewing wax.

She lost all her appetite.

Why did Cen Shaoqing suddenly eat meat?

Was it because of Ye Zhuo?

No!

It definitely wasn’t!

“She was the one who wanted to get to know Cen Shaoqing, and it was also Old Lady Lin who first proposed to introduce her to Cen Shaoqing. ”

Why did ye Zhuo get there first? Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

She should be the one sitting next to Cen Shaoqing now.

“Do you want to eat crab?”Cen Shaoqing asked ye Zao with her eyes lowered.

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly. “But I don’t eat crab meat. I only eat Crab Roe.”

“Because he was too lazy to eat crab meat, ye Zao basically didn’t touch crabs. ”

“”Okay, I’ll take care of the crab meat.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing picked up a crab and peeled it slowly. After peeling it, she picked up the crab roe and put it into a small plate. After peeling two large crabs in a row, Cen Shaoqing brought the plate to ye Zao. ”

“The plate was full of oily crab roe, which made one’s appetite soar. ”

“Do you want to pour some vinegar?”

“I can do it myself.”

Ye Zao was about to take the vinegar when Cen Shaoqing had already taken the vinegar and poured it on the Crab Roe.

“After doing all this, Cen Shaoqing began to peel the crab meat. ”

“Midway, he peeled two large prawns for ye Zao. ”

“Throughout the whole process, Ye Zao was in charge of eating while Cen Shaoqing was in charge of doing it. The combination was excellent. ”

This series of actions stunned the Lin family members.

“If they had not seen it with their own eyes, who would believe that the person in front of them was the CEN fifth master, who would cause people to change their expressions whenever they talked about him in the business world? ”

Feng Xianxian could not help but grit her teeth.

B * Tch!

“Ye Zhuo, this B * Tch! ”

Cen Shaoqing should be hers.

She should also be the one being envied.

What right did ye Zhuo have?

“After the birthday banquet ended, Lin Jincheng found Cen Shaoqing. “Little Cen, come with me.” ”

“Dad?”

Ye Zhuo was worried that Lin Jincheng would make things difficult for Cen Shaoqing.

Lin Jincheng felt a little uncomfortable when he saw that the pearl in his hand actually cared so much about a pig.

Lin Jincheng turned to look at Ye Zhuo. “I just want to say a few words to Little Cen.”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly and didn’t ask any more questions. Cen Shaoqing should just pray for his own good fortune.

Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads and felt a little flustered.

He was very clear about his own situation.

“After Lin Jincheng brought Cen Shaoqing away, Lin Ze walked to ye Zao’s side. “Zao Zao, I have something to tell you too.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zao followed Lin Ze’s footsteps and the siblings walked towards the garden.

Cen Shaoqing followed Lin Jincheng all the way to the study room.

“Lin Jincheng pointed at the sofa and said, “Sit.” ”
