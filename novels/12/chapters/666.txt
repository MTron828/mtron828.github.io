Translator: 549690339

“At this point, Ye Zhuo turned to look at old lady cen and continued, “When you woke up in the morning, did you feel weak all over? Your appetite became worse and worse, and your desire for the so-called health-preserving soup grew stronger and stronger?” ”

Old Lady Lin’s heart skipped a beat.

Because ye Zhuo was right.

Her current situation was almost exactly the same as what ye Zhuo had said.

“Seeing old madam Lin like this, Ye Zhuo understood. “Looks like I was right.” ”

Feng Qianhua could no longer control the fear in her heart. She cried and knelt down to old madam Lin. “Aunt Lin! Don’t believe her! She’s talking nonsense! None of this is true! I definitely didn’t drug you! No!”

“Old Mrs. Lin just looked at Feng Qianhua, her whole body trembling. ”

That gaze was as if it was the first time she had met her.

“From the beginning to the end, she trusted Feng Qianhua very much. She never doubted that Feng Qianhua would make a move in the health soup. ”

“Could it be that all these years, she had raised an ingrate by her side? ”

An ingrate!

Was Feng Qianhua really an ingrate?

Old Madam Lin’s heart was in a mess.

She could not believe the truth.

This was not true!

“”Why Are You Crying Without You?”Ye Zhuo continued, “Grandma, if you don’t believe me, you can go to the hospital for a full body check-up. I believe that the Doctor will definitely give you a standard answer. Why Don’t we go now? “Now that the medical technology is so advanced, I believe that the results will be out very soon.” ”

Go to the hospital? How could she go to the hospital?

“Old Lady Lin had been drinking health-preserving soup for so many years, and her body had accumulated a lot of toxins. There was no way she could escape the sophisticated medical equipment. ”

“Feng Qianhua stood in front of Old Lady Lin, “You can’t go to the hospital! Aunt Lin, you have to believe me. I really didn’t drug you! Aunt Lin, I have always treated you like a mother. How could I do that to you? You have to believe me!” ”

“She has guarded Lin Jincheng for so many years, and made so many efforts, she can not let these efforts all fall apart! ”

I can’t!

“Xu Lanyue looked at Feng Qianhua, “Qian Hua!”She said in a stifled voice! Now that things have come to this, witnesses and evidence are all there, you tell Old Mrs. Lin it, the prescription of the health soup is provided to you, there is no addictive poison you and I are very clear! I only regret not stopping you and your mother back then... “... “.. ”

“But there are some things that even if you regret it, there is no medicine for regret. ”

“At this point, Xu Lanyue burst into tears. “If I had stopped you and your mother back then, things wouldn’t have come to this! I’ve Let Old Lady Lin Down, I’ve let everyone down...” ”

“”Nonsense! You’re talking nonsense!”Feng Qianhua cried. “I don’t even know you! All of you want to frame me! All of you are talking nonsense! Aunt Lin, I beg you, don’t believe them!” ”

Feng Qianhua even wanted to kill Xu Lanyue now.

She didn’t understand why Xu Lanyue would suddenly switch sides.

Ye Zao!

It must be ye Zao!

Feng Qianhua looked up at Ye Zao. “It’s You! It must be you! You B * Tch! You must have said something in front of her! You’re slandering me! B * Tch! Why Don’t you go to Hell!”

“Feng Qianhua then turned to look at Old Madam Lin. “Aunt Lin, you have to believe me. You have to believe me! I didn’t do these things. It’s Ye Shu and ye Zao, these two B * tches, who are slandering me!” ”

Old Madam Lin’s face was devoid of any color.

“In such a situation, if she was still unable to see through the situation, she would be too stupid. ”

“However, she could not understand why Feng Qianhua would treat her like this! ”

“Thinking of what she had done all these years, old madam Lin broke out in a cold sweat. ” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“In order to protect Feng Qianhua and her daughter, she had hurt so many people, but Feng Qianhua treated her like this! ”

Nineteen years!

A whole nineteen years.

“She treated Feng Qianhua so well, but Feng Qianhua almost destroyed her family. ”

“”B * Tch! Only you are the real B * Tch Here!”Old Lady Lin raised her hand, she slapped Feng Qianhua hard, she said angrily, “I treated you so well, and I even tried to set you up with Jin city. I treated Xianxian like my own granddaughter! Why did you hurt me like this? Where is your conscience? has your conscience been eaten by a dog?” ”

Old Mrs. Lin did not show any mercy with her slap. She used all her strength to hit Feng Qianhua’s face so hard that blood dripped from the corner of her mouth.

Feng Qianhua covered her face and looked at Old Mrs. Lin in disbelief.
