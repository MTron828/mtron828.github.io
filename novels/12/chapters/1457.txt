“”It’s useless.”Xia Xiaoman shook her head and continued, “Zhuozhuo, why don’t you check my pulse again?” ”

“Okay.”

Xia Xiaoman reached out her hand.

“Ye Zhuozhuo reached out his hand and pressed on Xia Xiaoman’s wrist, focusing on listening to her pulse. ”

“A moment later, Ye Zhuozhuo let go of Xia Xiaoman’s hand and continued, “Fourth aunt, are you and fourth uncle taking birth control pills?” ”

“Birth control pills?”Xia Xiaoman shook her head. “Your fourth uncle and I wouldn’t even have time to have a child! How could we take birth control pills?”

Ye Zao frowned slightly. “Can you ask fourth uncle to come over and let me check his pulse?”

“Xia Xiaoman nodded. “Yes, I’ll call him right away.” ”

“Soon, Lin Qingxuan came over and extended her hand to ye Zao. ”

Ye Zao began to check their pulse.

Both of them were very healthy and there were no problems. The only thing they had in common was that both of them had taken birth control pills.

“Ye Zao continued, “Fourth Uncle, fourth aunt, try to recall if you’ve taken birth control pills with stronger effects during this period of time.” ”

“No.”Lin Qingxuan and Xia Xiaoman shook their heads.

“Ye Zhuo continued, “But from my diagnosis, the two of you seem to have taken birth control pills.” ”

“Xia Xiaoman frowned and said, “Zhuo Zhuo, didn’t you say that there were many vegetables with birth control pills on them? “During this period of time, other than eating outside, our family has sent the housekeeper to the countryside to buy organic vegetables in person. There shouldn’t be any random birth control pills.” ”

“Ye Zao said, “Logically speaking, it has been so long. The effects of the pills have long disappeared. They shouldn’t have remained in the body until now.” ”

“After saying that, ye Zao continued, “I’ll prescribe some more pills for you. This time, you and fourth uncle will drink them together.” ”

“Xia Xiaoman nodded. “Alright, then I’ll have to trouble you, Zao Zao.” ” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“It’s alright.”Ye Zao wrote the prescription and handed it to Xia Xiaoman.

Xia Xiaoman kept the prescription.

“After eating, Lin Qingxuan suddenly went to look for ye Zhuo. “Zhuozhuo.” ”

“”Fourth uncle.”Seeing Lin Qingxuan, ye Zhuo immediately put away his phone. ”

“Lin Qingxuan continued, “Zhuozhuo, is it convenient to go to the study?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded.

The uncle and niece came to the study.

“After closing the study door, Lin Qingxuan asked, “Zhuozhuo, tell fourth uncle honestly, is it fourth uncle’s problem?” ”

“Ye Zhuozhuo was stunned for a moment before he reacted. “Fourth uncle, you’re thinking too much. You and fourth aunt are both very healthy. There’s no problem at all.” ”

“”Are you sure?”Lin qingxuan continued, “Actually, over the years, fourth uncle has already thought it through. It doesn’t matter if he has a child or not. Anyway, fourth aunt and I already have a daughter, Lizi! “If it’s really my problem, don’t hide it from me, Zhuozhuo. Don’t hide it from your fourth aunt either. It’s unfair to your fourth aunt.” ”

“Ye Zhuozhuo looked at Lin Qingxuan, he said very seriously, “Fourth uncle, don’t worry. You really don’t have any problems. Would I lie to You? “Actually, having a child has something to do with your mood. Sometimes, you can’t rush things. Fourth uncle, don’t feel pressured.” ”

“Okay.”Lin Qingxuan nodded. “I know.”

“After knowing that he didn’t have any problems, Lin Qingxuan heaved a sigh of relief. He was most afraid of letting Xia Xiaoman down. ”

“Perhaps it was because his marriage with Zhao Shuning was too depressing. Ever since he married Xia Xiaoman, Lin Qingxuan finally understood what it meant to be a good husband and wife. ”

On the other side.

“After an eight-hour flight, Carl appeared at the airport in China’s biter city. ”

“As soon as he walked out of the airport, Carl felt that something was wrong. ”

It felt like someone was following him.

“But when he looked back, he didn’t see anyone! ”

Carl frowned. Could it be an illusion? Carl retracted his gaze and continued walking forward.

“At this moment, a mother carrying her child on her back quietly pulled up her collar and said in a low voice, “All teams, Carl has already discovered us. Remember to keep your distance!” ”

“Roger.”

“After getting into the car, Carl finally let down his guard. ”

Perhaps he had been on the plane for more than eight hours and was too tired to hallucinate?

Carl pinched his temples.

“Half an hour later, the car stopped in front of the apartment that Carl rented. ”

Carl got out of the car and walked to the driver’s seat to pay.

“At this moment, Carl did not notice that there was someone standing behind him. ”

“Under the dim street light, the man raised the stick in his hand. ”

Bang!
