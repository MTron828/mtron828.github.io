Translator: 549690339

An angry voice suddenly appeared in the air.

Ye Han.

It’s Ye Han again.

Ye Han frowned slightly.

“He only remembered that his name was Wu Han, and that his life and name were given by the autumn flute. ”

There was not a single thing about ye Han in his memory.

Why did everyone call him ye Han?

Why?

Did he forget something?

“Ye Han felt his temples swell and ache, and it was very uncomfortable. ”

“Hearing this, Qiu Di stood up from the chair and looked around, but did not see anyone. ”

Qiu Di narrowed his eyes. “Who? Who’s playing tricks there?”

The air fell into silence.

It was as if nothing had happened.

“Who is it?”Qiu Di asked again.

“Still, no one answered. ”

Ye Han also felt that it was a little strange. He took out the emei thorn and prepared to defend against the enemy.

“One second, two seconds, still no one answered in the air. ”

“In a moment, ye Han turned on his portable radar and scanned the room, but did not find any suspicious people. ”

“”Eldest miss, there is no one in the room.”Ye Han put away the radar and turned to look at autumn flute. ”

“Autumn flute sat down again. Although she found it strange, she didn’t think too much about it and sat back on the chair. ”

Ye Han handed ye Zao’s battle suit to autumn flute.

“Although the design of the pure black battle suit was simple, it didn’t lose the demeanor of a general. One could vaguely see the glorious life of the owner of the battle suit, making people feel awe. ”

“Autumn flute stretched out her hand to touch the battle suit. The corners of her mouth curled up slightly, and her eyes were full of pride. ”

“In the past, she didn’t even have the right to send clothes to ye Zhuo. ”

Today was different from the past.

“In the future, she would be the new owner of this battle suit. ”

“Unfortunately, Ye Zhuo was already dead. ”

“Otherwise, she would have been rather looking forward to ye Zhuo seeing this scene. ”

“This is Imperial Wind?”Autumn flute turned her head to look at Ye Han.

Imperial wind was the name of the battle suit.

“Ye Han nodded. “Yes, eldest miss.” ”

A satisfied look appeared in autumn flute’s eyes. “You can go out for a while.”

“Yes.”Ye Han nodded and turned to leave.

“In an instant, autumn flute was the only one left in the room. ”

“Autumn flute reached out to take off the battle suit. However, the moment her hand touched the button of the battle suit, a transparent shock wave suddenly appeared in the air and directly sent autumn flute flying. ”

Bang!

“Qiu Di fell heavily to the ground, blood seeping out from the corner of his mouth. ”

What was going on?

Qiu Di narrowed his eyes.

“Before Qiu di could react, a small beige ball drilled out of the battle suit. In front of the ball was a pair of big round eyes with a pair of wings on the back. ”

“The little guy looked very cute and was not a creature owned by Changyue. “Bad woman, Shameless! You want to replace Miss Ye’s position with just you? Dream On!” ”

A dark light flashed in Qiu Di’s eyes. “Who are you?”

“”You’re the Thing, your whole family is the Thing!”The little guy flapped his wings. “I’m the spirit of the armor!” ”

Spirit of the armor?

Qiu Di was stunned.

She had only read about the spirit of the armor in history books and thought it was just a legend. She did not expect that such a thing really existed.

“The spirit of clothes was a guardian of the battle armor. If she wanted to put on ye Zao’s battle armor, she had to gain the trust of the spirit of clothes. ”

“Thinking of this, Qiu di narrowed her eyes without leaving a trace. When she raised her head to look at the spirit of clothes again, her expression had already changed. “You might have misunderstood something. Things aren’t what you think.” ”

“Saying this, Qiu di paused and continued, “Miss Ye and I are actually very good friends. It’s just that Miss Ye’s reputation is really too great, so I didn’t publicize it before.” ” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Good friend?”Yi Ling snorted coldly. “Do you take me for a Fool? How can miss ye be good friends with someone like you! Not everyone is ye Han and was fooled by You!”

“At the thought of Ye Han, Yi Ling was extremely angry. ”

“Ye Zhuo treated ye Han so well and treated ye Han even more intimately than his own brother, but what about ye Han? ”

What did ye Han Do?

Ye Han had actually betrayed ye Zhuo.

It felt that ye Zhuo was not worth it!

“Qiu Di continued to look pitiful, her eyes slightly red, “Whether you believe me or not, this is how things are. “Miss Ye and I have known each other for more than ten years. At that time, Miss Ye was only a child. “Our Friendship was also established at that time. Miss ye is a very grateful person. Because I saved her once more than ten years ago, she entrusted all the heavy responsibilities on her shoulders to me.” ”

“Just you? Save Miss Ye?”Yi Ling glanced at Qiu Di. “Are you qualified?”

“Qiu Di looked at Yi Ling and continued, “I can swear to the heavens that everything I said is true. If you don’t believe me, you can take a look at this.” ”
