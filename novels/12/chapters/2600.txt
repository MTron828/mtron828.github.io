“Although it wasn’t dog two’s first visit to the Lin family, it was his first time as an Lizi’s boyfriend. ”

“Ever since he became an Lizi’s boyfriend, the Lin family had changed the way they addressed him. ”

“Apart from Lin Ze, everyone now called him Ouyang. ”

Dog Two wasn’t used to this.

“Especially since the food tonight was served by CEN Shaoqing, how could he hold his chopsticks steady? ”

“Sit down. What are you standing there for?”Lin Ze saw dog two standing there in a daze and smiled. “We’re all on the same side today. Don’t be nervous.”

“Dog two turned to look at Lin Ze. “I, I, I, I’m not nervous.” ”

“Lin Ze smiled and said, “You’re already stuttering like this, and you still haven’t said that you’re not nervous?” ”

“Dog two gulped and looked around. It lowered its voice and said, “Brother ZE, sister, OH NO, is your brother-in-law here as well?” ”

“Yes.”Lin Ze nodded. “Is that why you’re Nervous?”

“Buttface said, “Not exactly. It just feels different from before.” ”

“He was just subconsciously nervous. No matter how many times he told himself in his heart, there was no need to be so nervous, but he would still be nervous. ”

“Lin Ze patted Buttface’s shoulder. “I understand how you’re feeling now. After all, this is the first time a big girl is in a bridal sedan. It’s okay. You’ll get used to it after experiencing it a few more times.” ”

“Lin Ze had experienced the same thing before, so he could understand how buttface felt at this moment. ”

“Buttface continued, “Do you think it’s better for me to talk more or less later?” ”

“Lin Ze said, “In my experience, if you can not talk, then don’t talk. If they ask you a question, you answer.” ”

“”Okay.”Buttface nodded. As if he suddenly remembered something, he immediately stood up from his chair. “Then, since they haven’t sat down yet, is it not good for me to sit down in advance?” ”

“”It’s fine, it’s fine.”Lin Ze smiled and said, “When they come, you can stand up again.” ” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Okay.”Buttface nodded.

“Not long after, Ye Shu and Xia Xiaoman walked out from the inner room, chatting and laughing. ”

“Buttface immediately stood up and said, “Auntie, Auntie Ye.” ”

“Ye Shu smiled and looked up. “Ouyang, sit down. We’re all on the same side. There’s no need to be so reserved.” ”

“”Thank you, Auntie Ye,”dog two said. ”

Ye Shu smiled and looked at Xia Xiaoman. “Look at how Sensible Ouyang is.”

Xia Xiaoman smiled and nodded.

“She was also very satisfied with dog two. As long as nothing happened between these two young people, dog two would be her future son-in-law. ”

“A moment later, Cen Shaoqing and Ye Zhuo also walked out from inside. ”

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “I heard that today’s dishes were personally cooked by Shaoqing. I must have a good taste later.” ”

“”Mom, aren’t you being too biased? I was clearly involved, but you gave all the credit to him!”Ye Zhuo continued. ”

“Ye Shu said, “Then I’ll have a good taste of my daughter’s cooking later.” ”

“Ye Zao clicked his tongue and said with a smile, “You’re being too perfunctory.” ”

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “You Child!” ”

“Ye Zao looked at Cen Shaoqing and said in a low voice, “I’m finally in your mood tomorrow.”Usually, when she went to the Cen family, Old Lady Cen was even more exaggerated than ye Shu. ”

Cen Shaoqing always questioned whether she was his biological child.

“Now, she also had to question whether she was his biological child. ”

Cen Shaoqing smiled. “This means that my future son-in-law has won the heart of my mother-in-law.”

“Narcissistic.”

“After everyone was present, they sat down. ”

“”Jingshu is definitely pregnant with a boy,”Xia Xiaoman said with a smile as she looked at Bai Jingshu. ”

“Bai Jingshu was already four months pregnant and her belly was obviously swollen. However, she no longer had such a big reaction to the pregnancy. ”

“It was always good to eat. In just one month, she had gained five to six kilograms of weight. Coupled with the fact that she was pregnant, she looked much more plump. ”

“Her body exuded a strong maternal glow, and she looked completely different from before. ”

“Bai Jingshu looked at Xia Xiaoman and asked, “Fourth aunt, how did you tell?” ”

“Xia Xiaoman said, “Looking at your pregnant state, it’s about the same as mine. Moreover, according to the old Lin family’s tradition, your fetus must be a boy.” ”

“Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “Actually, I quite like boys, but ah ze likes girls.” ”

“Xia Xiaoman said, “Just a second child will do.” ”

“Bai Jingshu said, “I’m just afraid that just like third aunt, three or four of them will be boys.” ”

“Xia Xiaoman laughed out loud. “That’s true. I heard that in the Lin family’s many generations, there was only one girl named searing. I wonder if it’s a genetic mutation.” ”
