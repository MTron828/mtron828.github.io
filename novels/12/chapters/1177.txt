“Hearing this, the reporters immediately turned around. ”

“Afraid that ye Zao had run away, everyone ran over quickly. ”

“In the blink of an eye, Ye Zao was surrounded by the reporters. ”

Zhao Xueyin curved her lips slightly.

Good! Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

This was really great!

She finally saw ye Zao’s retribution!

“”President Ye! May I ask how you managed to make the Jiang Financial Group rise again overnight, and the stock price rose by the daily limit?” ”

“President Ye! Do you have any experience to share with the financiers in front of the TV?”

“President Ye...”

Zhao Xueyin was stunned.

She almost thought she was hearing things.

Rise Again?

The daily limit?

What was going on?

Wasn’t it the Jiang Financial Group that declared bankruptcy?

“Zhao Xueyin gulped with difficulty. Then, she took out her phone and opened the stock market. ”

“When she saw it, her face immediately turned pale. ”

Her blood flowed back.

The limit!

The Jiang Financial Group’s stock price had indeed gone up by the limit!

“Then, she looked at the headlines of the financial news. The news was about the Jiang Financial Group. ”

If the Jiang Financial Group didn’t go bankrupt...

Then what was going on with her?

“Thinking of her speech just now, Zhao Xueyin was so regretful that her intestines turned green. ”

Embarrassing!

It was really too embarrassing!

Zhao Xueyin’s sense of superiority in front of the camera just now disappeared without a trace.

No.

Such a report must not be published.

Zhao Xueyin pinched her fingers.

“At this moment, ye Zhuo passed by her. ”

Ye Zhuo did not say anything.

But Zhao Xueyin’s face was burning with pain.

“Before Zhao Xueyin could react, a microphone was handed to her. “Miss Zhao, did you not think well of President Ye’s plan before? May I ask what your mood is now?” ”

“To be able to help the Jiang Financial Group rise from the dead and Rise Again! Does this mean that President Ye’s ability is stronger than yours as the acting chief?”

“Is your relationship with President Ye not good in private?”

The reporters’questions were getting sharper and sharper.

“Zhao Xueyin tried her best to maintain a smile. “I’m sorry, I have something to do!” ”

“After saying this, Zhao Xueyin fled in a panic. ”

“When she reached the office on the 58th floor, Zhao Xueyin called Annie over. “Call the Finance and economics television station and ask them to cut out the part where they interview me!” ”

That video had to be cut out!

“”But... it might be too late,”Annie stammered. ”

“Why?”Zhao Xueyin asked.

Annie pointed at the television hanging on the wall. “It’s... It’s already broadcasting live.”

Zhao Xueyin raised her head and saw her own face.

“She stood in front of the camera, with a confident expression, she said, “Actually, from the very beginning, I didn’t agree with President Ye’s plan. Although President Ye is elder Ye’s descendant, he still lacks some actual combat experience. Unfortunately, President Ye didn’t seem to listen to my words. I’m also very regretful that her willful actions caused such a result today!” ”

Zhao Xueyin grabbed the teacup by the side and threw it over!

PA!

The Teacup directly smashed the television screen.

“Although the television screen was broken, the sound continued. ”

“”Actually, there’s nothing much to say. Be a good person first, then you can do good deeds...” ”

This was ye Zhuo’s voice.

“What a good sentence, be a good person first, then you can do good deeds. ”

Was Ye Zhuo mocking her?

She deserved it!

“Zhao Xueyin took a deep breath, picked up the vase on the table, and threw it at the television again. ”

RIP —

“This time, the television was completely smashed. ”

Annie stood at the side and swallowed with difficulty.

“Get lost!”Zhao Xueyin continued.

Annie immediately walked out.

Only when she reached the door did she let out a heavy breath.

No.

She must return the humiliation she suffered today to ye Zao a hundredfold.

Zhao Xueyin tried hard to calm herself down.

She couldn’t panic now.

Please have a drink.

Invite a drink over first.

This time.

She must not lose to ye Zao.

She made an appointment with a drink tomorrow.

Zhao Xueyin sent a message to order desserts.

The next day at 3 pm.

Zhao Xueyin brought dessert and appeared punctually at the studio of shallow drink.

Shallow drink’s studio was located in the most prosperous area in the financial world.

“Knowing that Zhao Xueyin was coming, Rebecca waited at the door early. “Hello, are you the Miss Zhao that Mr. Yang mentioned?” ”

Zhao Xueyin nodded. “I am.”

Rebecca made a ‘please’gesture. “Follow me this way.”

Zhao Xueyin followed Rebecca’s footsteps.

“Soon, the two of them arrived at the third floor of the studio. ”

“Rebecca said, “Please wait here for a moment. I’ll go in and get some information.” ”

“Okay.”Zhao Xueyin nodded.

Rebecca entered the office in the inner room.

Zhao Xueyin stood in place.

Tap Tap Tap —

“At this moment, footsteps appeared in the air. ”

Could it be that Xiao Jiu had come?

“Zhao Xueyin smiled and turned around. When she saw who it was, her smile froze at the corner of her mouth. ”

This was...

Ye Zhuo?

How did ye Zhuo appear in Qian Zhuo’s studio?

Zhao Xueyin’s gaze landed on the dessert in ye Zhuo’s hand and immediately had an answer in her heart.

Ye Zhuo was following her!

“If ye Zhuo wasn’t following her, how did ye Zhuo find this place? ”

Ye Zao did not just follow her.

He even planted a spy by her side.

“Otherwise, how would ye Zao know that Qian Zhu liked desserts! ”

“More importantly, the desserts in ye Zao’s hands were exactly the same as hers. ”

Shameless!

He was simply Shameless.

Ye Zao wanted to snatch Qian Zhu away from her?

Dream On!

“At this moment, Rebecca walked out of the office. When she saw ye Zao, she was about to say something, but Zhao Xueyin spoke first, “Miss Rebecca, I heard that you have to make an appointment to see Master Qian Zhu, right?” ”

“Yes.”Rebecca nodded. “You have to make an appointment three days in advance.”

“Then how did she come in?”Zhao Xueyin pointed at ye Zao.

“Rebecca quickly said, “Miss Zhao, let me introduce you. This is the boss of our studio, Qian Zhu.” ”
