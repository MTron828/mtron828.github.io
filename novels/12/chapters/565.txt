“After saying that, Zhao shuning turned around and left. ”

“Li Yibiao stood up as well. “Fourth Madam Lin, Please Wait!” ”

Zhao shuning turned around and looked at Li Yibiao.

“Li Yibiao continued, “Fourth Madam Lin, are you sure that what you said is true?” ” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“No matter how unloved this granddaughter of the Lin family was in the Lin family, she was still a member of the Lin family. ”

Marrying the Lin family’s granddaughter was also beneficial to him.

Besides.

The granddaughter that the Lin family had just acknowledged was still young.

She was only 19 years old.

“She was also good-looking. Just thinking about it made one’s heart go wild, and one’s entire body felt hot. ”

Being able to marry the Lin family’s granddaughter was simply killing two birds with one stone!

“Zhao shuning smiled and said, “Whether it’s true or not, won’t Mr. Li come to our Lin family tomorrow morning and find out?”After saying that.., zhao shuning continued, “Mr. Li, to tell you the truth, my mother’s family is very satisfied with you. As long as you agree to this matter, it will be done!” ”

“Alright! Then I’ll have to trouble fourth Madam Lin to tell Old Lady Lin that I’ll definitely pay her a visit tomorrow morning!”

“Hearing this, a glimmer flashed across Zhao shuning’s eyes. ”

It was done!

“Zhao shuning nodded. “Alright, then it’s settled! I’ll wait for you at the Lin Family Tomorrow Morning.”After saying that, Zhao shuning walked out. ”

“”Fourth Madam Lin, I’ll send you off!”Li Yibiao walked in front politely. ”

“Zhao shuning smiled and said, “From now on, we’re in-laws. According to seniority, Mr. Li, you’ll have to follow my niece and call me fourth aunt.” ”

Li Yibiao also smiled. “Then I’ll have to rely on fourth aunt’s auspicious words!”

“”Don’t worry,”Zhao shuning continued, “There definitely won’t be any mistakes in this matter.” ”

“On the way back to the Lin family estate, Zhao shuning was in a good mood. ”

“However, just as he walked into the Lin family estate, the smile on Zhao Shuning’s face froze on the corner of his mouth. ”

“Lin Qingxuan!”

Zhao shuning shouted angrily. His facial features were almost ferocious.

“Lin Qingxuan was shocked. When she turned around and saw that it was Zhao shuning, her face turned pale. “Shuning, let me explain.” ”

“Before Lin Jincheng could react, Zhao shuning rushed up and slapped Lin Qingxuan in the face. “Kneel down! Kneel down!” ”

Lin Qingxuan bent her knees and knelt down.

The servants at the side were also shocked. They looked at Zhao shuning and almost forgot to react.

Zhao shuning let go of the servant’s hair. “Shameless B * Tch! I told you to seduce someone else’s husband! I’ll beat you to death today!”

“”Fourth madam, I didn’t! You’ve Misunderstood Me!” ”

Lin Jincheng quickly stopped Zhao shuning. “Fourth sister-in-law! What are you doing?”

“Can’t you see that I’m lecturing the mistress?”Zhao shuning glared fiercely at Lin Jincheng. “This B * Tch wants to seduce Qingxuan!”

The servant cried and shook her head. “No! I didn’t!”

“Lin Jincheng also said, “Fourth sister-in-law! It’s true that you’ve misunderstood them! I was just by the side just now. Fourth brother was just talking to Little Du. It’s not as serious as you say. Don’t be so impulsive!” ”

“Zhao shuning turned to look at Lin Qingxuan, “How many times have I told you? You’re not allowed to talk to other women! You’re not allowed to talk to other women! How Did You Promise Me? I haven’t even left for a while, and you’re already trying to cheat on me right under my nose!” ”

You’re not allowed to talk to other women?

Lin Jincheng looked at Zhao shuning in disbelief.

“If that was really the case, then Zhao Shuning was too controlling! ”

“In daily life, it was impossible not to talk to other women. ”

Because saying something insignificant to the opposite sex was exchanged for a slap and kneeling on the ground.

Was Zhao Shuning’s mind a little twisted?

“Because Lin Qingxuan and Zhao shuning lived abroad all year round, Lin Jincheng had never known that the way they interacted was like this! ”

“In his shock, Lin Jincheng looked at Xiao Du. “Xiao Du, my fourth sister-in-law was too impulsive just now. I’ll apologize on her behalf. Go back and rest for a week. I’ll tell the Butler that I’ll give you double your salary this month.” ”

“Xiao du nodded, covered his face and ran to the servant’s room while crying. ”

“Lin Jincheng turned to look at Zhao shuning. “Fourth sister-in-law, don’t you think you’ve gone too far? Fourth Brother is a human. How can he only talk to men and not women?” ”

“”Men have gold under their knees. Fourth brother, get up first.”Lin Jincheng helped Lin Qingxuan up. ”

“Zhao shuning waved Lin Jincheng’s hand away, “Lin Jincheng! Let me tell you! You Better Mind Your Own Business First! You should mind your own business!” ”
