Translator: 549690339

“Bai Mo, you can’t go back. ”

“Although the voice wasn’t loud, Bai Mo heard it just in time. ”

Bai Mo’s pupils constricted and she looked back.

She saw Liu Chao appear behind her at some point in time.

“What do you mean?”Bai Mo subconsciously felt that things weren’t that simple.

“Liu Chao continued, “Didn’t I say it before? In the future, you can only be like me and be an ordinary person on Earth.” ”

Bai Mo had always looked down on Earthlings.

She felt that all Earthlings were inferior.

“Now, she was unable to return to the s galaxy and could only live on Earth forever. To her, it was worse than death. ”

“”It’s You! It’s you who hid the interstellar shuttle, isn’t it! Liu Chao! I think you don’t want to live anymore!”Bai Mo glared at Liu Chao. ”

“The corners of Liu Chao’s mouth curled into a mocking smile. “Bai Mo, don’t you understand what’s going on now that things have developed to this point?” ”

“Liu Chao was an ordinary person in the s galaxy, and Earth was no exception. ”

How could he have the ability to hide the interstellar shuttle?

Bai Mo was stunned.

It was ye Zhuo.

It had to be ye Zhuo.

Ye Zhuo had taken her shuttle.

What should she do now?

She couldn’t stay on Earth forever.

She had to return to the s galaxy.

“Bai Mo tried her best to calm herself down. She turned to look at Liu Chao, then, she said, “Liu Chao, as long as you tell me where the interstellar shuttle is, I can let bygones be bygones! I can even bring you back to the S Galaxy so that you can live a life that ordinary people envy.” ”

“”Bai Mo, do you think I’ll believe your nonsense again?”Liu Chao said angrily, “If it weren’t for you, I wouldn’t have become like this!” ”

Liu Chao would never forget what he looked like when he first came to Earth.

He had even slept with a group of rats.

“He was born on a high-class planet and enjoyed the most advanced technology. Once he came to Earth, he was like a Yuanmou Person and was very unfamiliar with everything on Earth. ”

No one knew how much pain he had suffered during that time.

“At that time, he still didn’t know that the mastermind of all this was Bai Mo.. ”

He had always treated Bai Mo as his savior.

“Now that he thought about it, he was simply extremely stupid. ”

“Bai Mo continued, “Liu Chao, trust me one more time! In the past, I was young and ignorant. It was my fault. I shouldn’t have done that! Now That I’m Yours, a woman should treat her husband as heaven and her son as Earth. After we return to the s galaxy, we will immediately get married and have another child. Our family of three will live a happy life.” ”

“Although Bai Mo had fallen to such a state, her mind was still clear. She knew that she could not go head-to-head with Liu Chao at this time. ”

She should be soft when she should be soft.

“Rather than infuriating Liu Chao, it was better to let Liu Chao have a bright future. ”

“After all, at this time, the only person who could help her was Liu Chao. ”

She was the daughter of the Bai family in the s galaxy. How could Liu Chao be worthy of her!

“When she reached the s galaxy, she would kill Liu Chao immediately! ”

“It was undeniable that Bai Mo’s promise was very tempting. If it had been anyone else, they might have already wavered. ”

But Liu Chao would not.

“Because he would never forget the life he had first come to Earth, and now he had already adapted to life on Earth. ”

He did not think that Earth was worse than the s galaxy.

“The people of the s galaxy felt that they were superior to others. In fact, their material life and spiritual life were far inferior to Earth’s. ”

“Compared to the distant s galaxy, he preferred life on Earth. ”

The people of Earth were more flesh and blood than the people of s galaxy.

“”I forgot to tell you that on Earth, we are already a legal couple,”said Liu Chao. ”

Liu Chao’s biggest wish was to get married and have children.

Bai Mo had a good appearance and figure. She was a good choice for a wife.

“What did you say?”Bai Mo’s face was full of disbelief.

A legal couple?

She and a lowly person like Liu Chao were a legal couple?

How was that possible!

It couldn’t be!

Bai Mo’s stomach churned and she almost vomited.

It was so disgusting.

“”Looks like you’ve forgotten, but it doesn’t matter. You just have to remember that from now on, you’ll be my Liu Chao’s person in life and my Liu Chao’s ghost in death.” ”

He wanted to torture Bai Mo for the rest of his life and make her pay the price.

“Bai Mo stood there, her face extremely pale. At this moment, she suddenly thought of using the chip in her body to contact the emergency contact of the s galaxy. ”

She had two emergency contacts in total. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“One was her mother, and the other was Bai Yuanyuan. ”

“According to the time calculation, her mother should still be at the gambling table at this moment, so it was definitely impossible to contact her mother. ”
