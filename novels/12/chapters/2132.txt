Mrs. Duanmu shook her hand without batting an eyelid.

“Duanmu Feng and Mrs. Duanmu frowned slightly. For some reason, they didn’t like this woman named Ning ‘er.”

“After shaking her hand, Mrs. Duanmu continued, “I still have something to do. Excuse me.””

Ning ‘er nodded. “Go ahead.”

“Walking into the police station, Duanmu Feng and Mrs. Duanmu lowered her voice and asked, “Mom, who was that woman just now?””

“Didn’t she blow up her house?”Mrs. Duanmu asked.

“You don’t know her either?”Duanmu Fengyu asked.

Mrs. Duanmu didn’t say anything and didn’t refute.

“At this moment, Duanmu Fengyu seemed to realize something. “She, she, she couldn’t be, could be...”could she be the woman that Duanmu Liangchen raised outside? Duanmu Fengyu didn’t know how to continue.”

“Yes.”Mrs. Duanmu nodded.

“Really?”Duanmu Fengyu widened her eyes in disbelief.

“Yes.”Mrs. Duanmu didn’t have any special expression on her face.

Duanmu fengyu frowned. “Are all mistresses nowadays so arrogant? They actually dare to show off in front of their original wives!”

“Don’t worry about her.”Mrs. Duanmu wasn’t in the mood to care about these things.

“The most important thing now was how to protect Duanmu Fenfei. No matter what, she couldn’t let Cen Haifeng Kick Duanmu Fenfei Out!”

No Way!

“No matter what, she was the mistress of the Duanmu family, and Duanmu Fenfei was the most important thing in the Duanmu family’s glory. If one of them suffered, the other would suffer!”

Mrs. Duanmu understood this.

“At this moment, Duanmu Liangchen walked out. When he saw the mother and daughter walking over, he ignored Mrs. Duanmu and shouted, “Fengyu!””

“In the past, Duanmu Fengyu wouldn’t have cared about this detail.”

“However, it was different now. Ever since she found out about her father’s matter, she felt that her father disrespected her mother too much. Furthermore, she had just seen a mistress who was about the same age as her at the door, so she didn’t want to bother with Duanmu Liangchen.”

“Moreover, Duanmu Fengyu could not get over her psychological state. In her opinion, no matter what, Duanmu Liangchen should not have brought the woman outside directly to Mrs. Duanmu to disgust her.”

“”Jingzhi.”When Duanmu Liangchen saw that his daughter was ignoring him, he looked at Mrs. Duanmu curiously. “Jingzhi, what happened to Fengyu?””

“”Nothing.”Mrs. Duanmu shook her head and continued, “How was it? Did you see your sister?”?”

“I saw her.”Duanmu Liangchen nodded.

“How was it?”Mrs. Duanmu asked. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Upon hearing this, Duanmu Liangchen sighed. “It wasn’t very good.””

“Duanmu Huangfei had been strong for more than half of her life, and she had also been the wife of the Chief Alliance for more than half of her life. How could she be willing to suddenly become a prisoner!”

“Most importantly, the person who had made her a prisoner was her husband who had slept with her for so many years.”

Mrs. Duanmu also sighed. “Fengyu and I will go in to see her.”

“”Okay.”Duanmu liangchen continued, “I’m going out for a while.””

“Okay.”

“Duanmu Fengyu asked despite knowing the answer, “What are you going out for?””

“”What’s wrong with you, child? How dare you not address me as your father!”!”

Duanmu Liangchen berated.

“Duanmu fengyu continued, “Are you deliberately making things difficult for my mother?””

“Ignore her.”Mrs. Duanmu grabbed Duanmu Fengyu’s arm. “You can go out first.”

“Duanmu Liangchen could tell what was going on from these words. Without saying anything else, he turned around and walked out.”

“Duanmu Fengyu looked at Mrs. Duanmu. “Mother, why didn’t you let me say it just now!””

“”Now is not the time to argue about this.”Mrs. Duanmu continued, “Fengyu, you are already an adult. In the future, you have to sit in the position that all women in the world have to sit in. No matter what you do, you have to know when to advance or retreat and take into account the overall situation.””

“Duanmu fengyu nodded, but she was a little nervous. Now that the DUANMU family had experienced such a huge change, could she still successfully marry the young master of Dongli?”

“”Don’t worry.”Mrs. Duanmu looked at Duanmu Fengyu, she comforted her, “The past Chief Alliance must marry the daughter of the Duanmu family. This is a rule left behind by the ancestor, and no one can break it. As long as you don’t let anyone say anything, you don’t have to worry about this problem.””

“Okay.”Duanmu fengyu nodded.

“She felt that the decision not to let her go to Earth was the right one. If she had insisted on going to Earth, she might have already caused a huge disaster.”

The mother and daughter were brought to a room by the prison guard.

“There was only a bed and a stool in the room. Other than that, there was nothing else. Duanmu huangfei sat on the stool and looked at the mother and daughter through the window.”
