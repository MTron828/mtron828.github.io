“When she mentioned ye Zhuo, Old Mrs. Cen’s face was full of smiles. She had a belly full of words to say. ”

“Bai Shu had never seen ye Zhuo before. When she heard Old Mrs. Cen’s description, she said in disbelief, “Is it that exaggerated?”After so many years, what kind of beauty had she not seen? Moreover, the Bai sisters were not ugly when they were young. Bai Shu really could not imagine how beautiful ye Zhuo was. ”

“”You’ll know when you see him,”said old Madam Cen. ”

“Bai Shu looked at the heavy snow outside the door. “It’s really hard on Shaoqing. It’s snowing so heavily and he still has to go to the airport! Can’t we just get the chauffeurs to pick him up?”Otherwise, wouldn’t the Cen family’s chauffeurs be wasted? ”

“”That’s different! As Shaoqing’s boyfriend, it’s only right and proper for him to pick up his girlfriend!” ”

“Bai Shu said, “What’s the difference? Who Wouldn’t accept a girlfriend? Don’t tell me that a flower can bloom?” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen turned to look at Bai Shu and continued, “Let me ask you a question.” ”

“”You ask,”Bai Shu said. ”

“Is the refrigerator refrigerated?”

“Yes.”Bai Shu nodded.

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Can the air conditioner be refrigerated?” ”

“Bai Shu said, “Of course it can.” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen nodded and continued, “Then the question is, if the refrigerator is always open, can it have the same effect as the air-conditioner?” ”

“Bai Shu was a little speechless and said, “Of course not! The refrigerator is the refrigerator, and the air-conditioner is the air-conditioner. These two types of electrical appliances are different.” ”

“”You also know that they are different! “Then can shaoqing and the driver be the same?”Old Mrs. Cen continued, “That’s why I said that you will never have such an outstanding granddaughter-in-law like my granddaughter-in-law. I really feel sad and sad for your Ah Niu. How did he end up with your grandmother who is not even forty or sixty years old!” ”

“At the end of her sentence, old Mrs. Cen said with a proud face, “I am really a little smart-ass!” ” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Bai Shu stood where she was and scratched her head. She felt that something was wrong, but she couldn’t figure out what it was. After a long while, she sighed, “The descendants of your Cen family are all infatuated!” ”

“If they weren’t infatuated, would cen Shaoqing pick them up in the middle of the night? ”

“Back then, Old Cen was like this, and later Cen Haifeng was like this. Now, Cen Shaoqing couldn’t escape this fate. ”

“Originally, when it came to Cen Shaoqing’s generation, Bai Shu thought that the Cen family would really produce a monk. Who would have thought that she had just not met the right person previously. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen smiled and said, “This is a good gene, it has to be passed down! I hate those people who have no sense of responsibility and are fooling around outside. If I Were you, I would have already broken your third brother’s leg!” ”

Old Mrs. Cen had always been a person who did not say much.

“Bai Shu sighed at the mention of her third brother. “I’m his mother, you can’t really let me break his legs! You’re just being stubborn. If it were you, I’d see if you could do it!” ”

“”Why can’t I do it? Clearly, you’re the one who doesn’t have the courage. Have you seen that disappointing fourth girl in my house? “You can sever your relationship with her at any moment. If you don’t show her some strength, she’ll never know who is the grandmother and who is the grandson!”Speaking of this.., old Mrs. Cen was really courageous. If it had been anyone else, it would have been fine if she had endured it. After all, Cen Yuyan was already pregnant. ”

But Old Mrs. Cen didn’t.

“Not only did she not endure it, she even severed her relationship with Cen Yuyan and made her suffer the consequences. ”

“Bai Shu sighed again. “I’m old, I don’t want to care about those things anymore.” ”

“”You’re not old, you’re spoilt!”Old Madam Cen glanced at Bai Shu, “You’re his mother, yet you didn’t teach him how to behave. Sooner or later, someone in society will teach him how to behave! There will be days for you to regret! This year, during the New Year, don’t let that unlucky thing come over to wish me a happy new year. I get annoyed just by looking at it! “I’ll leave you with these words today. You have to take it to heart. Don’t embarrass everyone when the time comes!” ”

Old Mrs. Cen hated men who cheated the most in her life.

Even if they were her own nephew.

“She couldn’t control other people’s affairs, but she could control herself. She could disown that nephew. ”

“Bai Shu knew old Mrs. Cen’s temper and knew that she wasn’t joking. She nodded and said, “I know. Don’t worry! I’ll definitely not let him bother you!” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “It’s getting late. Let’s go back and rest.” ”

“Bai Shu said, “It’s almost the new year. When I see your granddaughter-in-law, I should go back too.”Old Mrs. Cen said that ye Zao was like a bird in the sky. Bai Shu really wanted to see what ye Zao looked like. ”
