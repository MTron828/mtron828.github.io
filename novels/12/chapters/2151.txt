“”Wait,”Mrs. Duanmu said. ”

“What’s Wrong?”Duanmu Fengyu asked curiously.

“Mrs. Duanmu continued, “You shouldn’t be the one to inform them of this matter.” ”

“Then what should I do?”Duanmu Fengyu asked.

“Mrs. Duanmu looked at duanmu Fengyu and asked, “Do you think it’s better for Leo and Ye Han to come and support you uninvited, or do you think it’s better for you to invite them personally?” ”

“Of course it’s better for them to come uninvited!”Only then could her excellence be shown.

“Mrs. Duanmu nodded. “So, you can’t inform them about this matter.” ”

“Then what should I do?”Duanmu Fengyu asked.

“Come here.”

“Upon hearing this, Duanmu Fengyu immediately walked over and lowered her head to look at Mrs. Duanmu. ”

Mrs. Duanmu leaned into Duanmu Fengyu’s ear and whispered to her.

“”Okay, Mom, I got it.”Duanmu fengyu nodded. ”

“Mrs. Duanmu continued, “Fengyu, remember what I said. You are only responsible for spreading the news. Don’t get involved in anything else.” ”

“”Okay.”Duanmu fengyu continued, “Then I’ll do it now.” ”

“After saying that, Duanmu Fengyu turned around and left. ”

“”Go.”Looking at Duanmu Fengyu’s departing figure, Mrs. Duanmu narrowed her eyes. ”

Duanmu Feng and Ye Zao would definitely win this round!

“As for ye Zao, he could only serve as a foil for Duanmu Feng and Ye Zao for the rest of his life! ”

“If Duanmu Feng and Ye Zao were kind-hearted, Ye Zao could still survive for a few days. If Duanmu Feng and Ye Zao were unhappy, Ye Zao could only be a ghost. ”

“Soon, the rumor that the girlfriend of the chief allied country’s dongli young master looked like miss ye spread out. ” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

There were even people who said that Earth’s plastic surgery technology was advanced. This person who looked like ye Zhuo was made to look like Miss Ye.

It was absolutely disgusting.

“Hearing this news, Leo raised his hand and directly smashed the mahogany table under him. ”

“Leo was 98 years old this year. To humans, he was already in his 80s. However, he was from the Zerg race. Although he had a face similar to humans, his DNA was very different from humans, his age could not be compared to humans on earth. Furthermore, the Zerg’s Planet W had a 12-hour day, which was only according to Earth. Therefore, Leo was still a man in his prime at 98 years old. ”

“According to Earth’s age, he should be 45 years old. ”

“Not only was his age different, the Zerg’s strength was also much greater than humans. In addition, Leo was a mutated Zerg, so his strength was much higher than the Zerg’s. Therefore, he often broke things because he could not control his temper. ”

For example...

Now.

The sturdy mahogany table was directly split into two halves.

“Ye Zhuo had always been his idol, and was also the first person who had greater strength than him. ”

“Back then, when he was young and frivolous, Leo had said that if anyone could beat him in terms of strength, he would kneel down and call him daddy. He had thought that no one would have the chance to make him call him daddy in this lifetime, but who knew.., in the end, he was actually defeated by an eighteen-year-old girl. ”

That feeling... was quite uncomfortable.

“Although he had failed, Leo did not go back on his word. ”

“From now on, whenever he saw ye Zhuo, Leo would respectfully call him father searing. ”

“”Clan, clan leader, Are You Alright?”When the adjutant saw him like this, his voice could not help but tremble. ”

His heart was very perturbed.

Could it be that the clan leader had fallen ill again?

“Contact Mr. Ye for me.”Leo’s face was full of anger. “I have something to discuss with him.”

“Hearing Leo’s rather normal voice, the assistant calmed down a little and continued, “Alright, Please Wait a moment.” ”

“Ye Han was coincidentally attending a very important meeting. The Adjutant had contacted him for a very long time, but the answer he received was always to wait a little longer. ”

“Leo was originally an impatient person. Seeing that the adjutant couldn’t contact anyone, he angrily shouted, “Trash! You even contacted quite a few people, what use is there for me to raise you guys!” ”

“The adjutant was so scared that his face was covered in cold sweat, “Patriarch, chief ye is in a meeting, I... I...” ”

“Ye Han was in a meeting, what could he do? ”

“”Forget it, forget it!”Leo picked up the hat and put it on his head, buttoning the button on his uniform as he walked out, “Don’t contact me. I’m going to Changyue by myself. If I count on You Trash, I’m afraid I’ll have to wait until next year!” ”

“Seeing Leo’s figure disappear in front of him, the adjutant let out a sigh of relief. ”

It was too dangerous!

It was really too dangerous!

He thought he was going to become the mahogany table in Leo’s hands.

Leo piloted the aircraft all the way to changyue.
