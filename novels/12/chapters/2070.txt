Man Jiangshan was really angry.

“No matter what, Ye Zao was his daughter. ”

He was the one who gave ye Zao his life.

“Although they had given up on ye Zao before, they had no choice. They did not really want to give up on Ye Zao. If they really did not want to acknowledge ye Zao as their daughter, they would not want to acknowledge ye Zao back now. ”

But what about ye Zao?

“As a junior, it was fine if they did not understand their parents, but now, they still did such an embarrassing thing. ”

“Chang Yue country should have the surname man. Ye Zao should have left that position to man Xing. After all, man Xing was her biological sister. Leaving it to Ye Han, what was going on with Ye Han? ”

Did Ye Han have any relationship with the man family?

Wouldn’t that be a joke?

No.

She definitely couldn’t let the things in the man family be taken away by outsiders.

“Nick!”Man Jiangshan suppressed the anger in his heart and raised his head to call for his assistant.

“Very soon, his assistant walked in from outside the door. “Mr. President.” ”

“Connect me to Ye Zhuo.”Man Jiangshan pressed his temples.

Ye Zhuo?

“The assistant was stunned for a moment before man Jiangshan continued, “It’s miss ye from Chang Yue!” ”

“Yes.”The assistant nodded and immediately contacted the Chang Yue country.

“Very soon, the call was connected. ”

“”Hello, I’m Nick, the assistant of the Manxing country’s president. Please pick up your Miss Ye.” ”

“”I’m sorry, Miss Ye is no longer living in the Rain Pavilion. Can Our new king, Mr. Ye Han, pick her up?” ”

“Hearing this, Nick looked at man Jiangshan. ”

Man Jiangshan frowned slightly.

Ye Zhuo was no longer living in thoughtful rain pavilion!

Her actions were too fast!

“Just as the announcement was made, she moved out of thoughtful rain pavilion. ”

It seemed that this matter was already set in stone.

“Nick had been following man Jiangshan for a long time. He could see what man Jiangshan was thinking at a glance and continued, “Okay, thank you, since...” ”

“Before Nick could finish his sentence, man Jiangshan took the microphone from him. “I am man Jiangshan.” ”

“”Hello, Mr. President.”A respectful voice came from the other side. ”

“Man Jiangshan continued, “Give my regards to your Miss Ye. Congratulations to Mr. Ye Han for achieving great success.” ”

“After saying that, man Jiangshan cut off the connection. He pressed his temples and looked at Nick. “You can go out first.” ”

“Yes.”Nick bowed and walked out of the door

Man Jiangshan looked at Nick’s back and frowned slightly.

On the other side.

Ye Zhuo looked at Ye Han. “Go and tell Zhao Dan that I’m willing to go back with her.”

Ye Han was stunned. “What? Why?”

“Man Xing country came because of ye Zhuo’s power. Now, Ye Zhuo was actually willing to go back with Zhao Dan! ”

“Ye Zhuo’s expression did not change. “There are some things that need to be resolved, and they have to be resolved.” ”

“Ye Han nodded. “Alright, I’ll go now.” ”

Zhao Dan was waiting for Ye Zhuo outside.

“When he saw ye Han come out, he immediately stood up and said, “Mr. Xiao Ye.” ”

“Ye Han looked at Zhao Dan. “Madam, my sister asked me to pass on a message to you. She said that she’s willing to go back with you. When can we set off?” ”

“Hearing this, Zhao Dan thought that he was hearing things! ”

Ye Zhuo was actually willing to go back with her!

“Really?”

Ye Han nodded. “Yes.”

“”Good, good, good. I knew it. Your sister is a good child,”Zhao Dan said excitedly. “As long as she’s willing, we can set off immediately.” ”

“After saying this, Zhao Dan continued to ask, “Oh right, why did your sister suddenly agree to it!” ”

“To Zhao Dan, this was like a bolt from the blue. ”

“Ye Han relayed ye Zhuo’s words to Zhao Dan and continued, “She said that after so many years, she’s already tired.” ” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Tired?

“Zhao Dan did not have time to think too much. He smiled and said, “Mr. Xiao Ye, thank you. Then I’ll go back and make some preparations. I’ll come back tomorrow to pick up the full moon.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Han nodded.

“After Zhao Dan returned to his temporary residence, he immediately contacted man Jiangshan. “Jiangshan, Jiangshan! I have good news for You!” ”

Man Jiangshan was currently worrying about Ye Zhuo. “What Good News?”

“Ye Zhuo! Ye Zhuo is willing to come back! Do you think it’s Good News?”

Man Jiangshan was stunned.

“At this juncture, why would ye Zhuo suddenly want to come back? ”

Didn’t she already hand changyue over to Ye Han?

Man Jiangshan frowned. “Return? What did she tell you?”

“Zhao dan continued, “I didn’t see ye Zhuo in person. I saw Ye Han. Ye Han told me that after so many years, she was already tired! Thinking about it, it made sense. After all, man Xing country was her real home. which child wouldn’t be willing to go home when they were tired?” ”
