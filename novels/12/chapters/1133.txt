“”Yes, Grandma, I know.””

It seemed that ye Zao was not quite what she had imagined.

On the other side.

Zhou family.

“After mother-in-law Zhou went back, she showed the prescription given by ye Zao to her daughter-in-law, Ma Jianyue.”

“Ma Jianyue’s father was an old Chinese medicine practitioner. Since she was young, she had learned a lot from him. She was much more professional than a graduate student from a proper Chinese Medicine Academy.”

“”Jia Yue, let me take a look. Can this prescription really treat diabetes?””

“Ma Jia Yue took the prescription curiously. “Mom, who gave it to you?””

“Didn’t I attend elder Zhang’s welcoming banquet for the great-granddaughter of the Old Ye family today? She was the one who gave me this prescription!”

Ye Zhuo?

Ma Jia Yue frowned unhappily.

It wasn’t that ye Zhuo had offended her.

It was because Zhao Xueyin was her niece.

“If it wasn’t for Ye Zao, the Shunxi Financial Group would have been Zhao Xueyin’s world.”

“Zhao Xueyin was her niece. If Zhao Xueyin successfully accepted the Shunxi Financial Group and allowed the Zhao family to advance into an aristocratic family, she would also be able to benefit from it, wouldn’t she?”

But all of this was broken by ye Zao!

Could she have a good impression of ye Zao?

“Ma Jia Yue looked at the herbs on the prescription. “Ginseng, raw ground, cooked ground, astragalus, sealwort... Strange...””

“”Strange? What’s Strange?”Granny Zhou hurriedly asked, “Is there something wrong with the prescription?””

Ma Jia Yue shook her head. “There’s nothing wrong with the prescription! I just feel that this prescription is quite familiar!”

“At this moment, Ma Jia Yue seemed to have suddenly remembered something and continued, “I remember now! You took this prescription last year! Didn’t my father prescribe it to you? But you took it for more than three months, and it didn’t have any effect!””

Ma Jia Yue wasn’t lying. Her father had indeed prescribed this prescription for Granny Zhou last summer.

“When she heard this, Granny Zhou was very disappointed.”

She was also thinking too much.

How could a child in his twenties possibly have the confidence to cure diabetes?

“When she thought of this, Granny Zhou shook her head with a bitter smile. “Is it exactly the same as what your father prescribed for me last year?””

“Ma Jianyue scratched her head, “It’s not exactly the same. There are two herbs in here that my father didn’t use, but these two herbs don’t have the effect of treating diabetes at all. They only have the effect of invigorating qi and activating blood circulation. Chinese medicine pays attention to the right prescription, but these two herbs don’t have the right symptoms at all. What can they do?””

“Obviously, this was a prescription that had no effect at all.”

“Not only was it useless, it might even have side effects.”

“Looking at Granny Zhou’s disappointed face, ma jiayue continued, “Mom, if you don’t mind the pain, I have another prescription. Do you want to try it?”Even though her prescription couldn’t cure diabetes.., it could at least give the old lady some spiritual comfort.”

It was better than this unknown prescription!

“”Forget it, forget it.”Granny Zhou waved her hand.”

“She had been suffering from diabetes for a long time, and the thing she was most afraid of was drinking Chinese medicine.”

It was very bitter.

“If this folk prescription given by Ma Jiayue could really cure diabetes, she would be able to endure it. However, it was useless now, so why did she have to suffer this pain?”

“All these years, she had taken many folk prescriptions?”

Folk prescriptions were not as good as proper prescriptions.

Folk prescriptions were much more bitter than prescriptions.

“”Jia Yue, I’m going upstairs to rest. You should rest early too.”Granny Zhou stood up from her chair and walked upstairs.”

Ma Jia Yue nodded.

“The servant next to her said hesitantly, “Old, Old Lady.””

“What’s Wrong?”Granny Zhou turned around.

“The servant decided to give it a go and continued, “Old Madam, my husband has also suffered from diabetes for many years. If you don’t want to use this prescription, can you let me take it back and try it out?””

“Although Ma Jiayue had already said that this prescription was useless, the servant still wanted to try it out.”

What if it worked?

The Zhou family was famous in the financial world. That Miss Ye would definitely not use a fake prescription to fool Granny Zhou.

“The Zhou family was too lazy to ask for this prescription. In the servants’eyes, this was something that ordinary people couldn’t ask for.”

“Take it.”Mother-in-law Zhou waved her hand. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“”Thank you, Old Lady!”The servant immediately put away the prescription.”

“”Wait!”At this moment, Ma Jianyue suddenly spoke.”

“The servant stopped in her tracks. “Madam, is there anything else?””

Mother-in-law Zhou also looked at Ma Jianyue with a face full of question marks.

“Ma Jiayue continued, “Sister-in-law Wang, if you really want to use this prescription, then use it! But I have to say something first. After all, it’s a matter of life and Death!””
