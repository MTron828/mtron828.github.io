She was even prepared to be single for the rest of her life.

“If she met another irresponsible scumbag like Zhang Qiang, she might as well be single for the rest of her life!”

“”I get annoyed whenever I talk about this.”Zhou Yuelian said angrily, “I don’t know what’s going on with your brother either!””

“”Weiwei is a slow-tempered person. Don’t worry,”said Lin Sha.”

“I don’t want to talk about him!”

“Lin Sha continued, “By the way, Mom, when do you and dad plan to go back?””

“”We have a flight at 10 o’clock Tonight, and we’ll come back on Tuesday,”said Zhou Yuelian.”

“”So Urgent?”Lin Sha and weiwei frowned, “It’s already Friday, why don’t you guys not go back?””

“”We can’t not go back, we can’t lack people at the company! Besides, we’ve wasted enough time on this trip!””

“Okay!”Lin Sha nodded. “Let’s go out and have a meal while I deliver the things to the dormitory.”

“Okay.”

“After sending the things to the dormitory, Lin Sha went shopping with her parents.”

Zhou Yuelian also bought some gifts for Lin Sha’s grandmother.

“After shopping, Lin Sha took her parents to eat.”

“”Mom and dad, I used to work part-time in this shop. The sanitary conditions here are very good, and the taste is also very good.””

“Zhou Yuelian grabbed Lin Shasha’s hand, “Shasha, you don’t have to work so hard when you’re studying.”. “Mom, to be honest, the TV said that four years of university is the best four years of your life. Mom hopes that you can enjoy the best four years of your life. When you graduate in the future, you’ll have the opportunity to earn money. “If you miss these four years, you won’t have another chance.””

“Zhou Yuelian had never been to college, so she hoped that Lin Shasha would cherish this campus life.”

“Lin Shasha smiled and said, “Mom, it’s okay. I’m not tired at all.”Her starting point was far behind her peers, if she didn’t work hard to adapt, she would only become a burden to her peers in the future.”

“Zhou Yuelian continued, “You’re just like your brother, stubborn as hell!””

“After saying that, Zhou Yuelian turned to look at Lin Jinshui. “Don’t you have anything to say to Sha Sha?””

“Lin Jinshui was stunned. “AH? Say What?”Lin Jinshui basically did not care about anything. He would do whatever Zhou Yuelian asked him to do! Whether it was family matters or company matters, Zhou Yuelian would be in charge of everything.”

“”Forget it, forget it. You should just live well!”Zhou Yuelian was very helpless.”

Lin Jinshui did not speak anymore.

At the beauty salon.

“After a few hours of body maintenance, Xu Xiao turned to look at Xu Chaonan. “Auntie, let’s go out for a meal later?””

“Sure.”Xu Chaonan nodded.

“Hence, after walking out of the beauty salon, the two of them went to eat. Xu Xiao said, “Auntie, let’s go for a steak?””

“Just as Xu Chaonan was about to say yes, his cell phone rang.”

“Xu Chaonan picked up the phone and did not know what was said on the other end. Xu Chaonan’s expression changed. “Alright, I’ll be right there.””

“After hanging up the phone, Xu Chaonan turned to look at Xu Xiao. “Xiao Xiao, go eat by yourself. I still have something to do at the company, I’ll be leaving First!””

“”En.”Xu Xiao nodded. “Then Auntie, drive slowly on the road.””

“”I will.”At this moment, Xu Chaonan seemed to have thought of something and continued, “Oh right, Xiao Xiao, don’t dye your hair in the future. Expensive hair dyes are harmful to the body. It’s best if you can control it and dye it once a year.””

“Although young people nowadays liked to dye their hair, Xu Xiao dyed her hair too frequently. She remembered that the last time Xu Chaonan saw Xu Xiao, her hair was still yellow. Today, it had turned wine-red.”

“”I understand, aunt.””

“Looking at Xu Chaonan’s departing figure, Xu Xiao heaved a sigh of relief.”

“Every minute she was with Xu Chaonan, her nerves were tensed up, afraid that she would accidentally offend Xu Chaonan.”

“At this moment, Xu Xiao’s gaze was attracted by a distance not far away.”

That girl seemed to be a little familiar.

It was...

Lin Sha Sha!

“Seeing Lin Sha Sha, Xu Xiao narrowed his eyes.”

“Lin Sha Sha, this B * tch, caused her to lose so much face today!”

The person standing next to Lin Sha Sha was Lin Sha’s parents?

She thought that Lin Sha had a powerful backer!

It turned out that she only came from a small place.

Wait!

She would definitely make Lin sha regret her actions today.

“To dare to offend her, she really didn’t want to live anymore!” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

A glimmer flashed through Xu Xiao’s eyes.

At the Xu Residence.

“”Did you visit your aunt today?”A beautiful woman was sitting on the sofa, and the manicurist beside her was doing her nails.”
