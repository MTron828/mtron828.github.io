“On the other side, Feng Ying was poisoned. The Emergency Center did not dare to delay and immediately sent the nearest ambulance to the affordable villa area. ”

“However, it was the evening rush hour and there were many cars in the capital. The ambulance had just left the house when it was stuck in traffic. ”

“After completing a series of first aid measures, Feng Ying was not bad. She was somewhat looking forward to the arrival of the ambulance. ”

“The old lady was still sitting on the sofa in the living room. When she saw Feng Ying walk out, her expression was unclear. ”

She was the one who raised Feng Ying.

“Now, she had personally poisoned Feng Ying and watched Feng Ying Walk Step by step from a living person to death. Didn’t her heart hurt? ”

Of course it hurt!

But so what if it hurt?

“Since Feng Ying had already chosen this path, she should be responsible for her actions! ”

She was an adult now.

“As the grandmother who raised Feng Ying, she should be even more responsible for Feng Ying. ”

“Feng Ying walked over and glared at the old lady. She said viciously, “Feng Jingshu, let me tell you, I’m saved! Just wait for your death! You were the one who did this first. Don’t blame me for being unrighteous!” ”

“As a grandmother, Feng Shujing could easily give up her granddaughter’s life. So, there was no need for her to save Feng Shujing anymore! ”

“Do you think you can still be saved?”The old lady asked.

“Feng Shujing felt a little anxious as the old lady looked at her like that. But, when she thought about how she no longer felt uncomfortable, she felt a lot better. ”

She would be fine!

She would definitely be fine.

“But at this moment, Feng Ying felt a sharp pain in her stomach! ”

It was worse than the previous times!

It was painful.

It was so painful that Feng Ying immediately knelt on the ground. Her face was covered in cold sweat and she felt as if she had collapsed. It was as if she had just died.

“Feng Ying rolled to the old lady’s feet and reached out to pull on her pants. She used all her strength to open her mouth, “Grandma, please forgive me... I was wrong, I really know I was wrong! Grandma, I don’t want to die. Did you raise me since I was young just to poison me? Grandma, my mother has already left, I beg you to forgive me...” ”

Feng Ying really did not want to die.

“If she had known that the old lady would poison her and treat her so cruelly, she would not have left the old lady any face. ”

She should have snatched the plain jade on the first day she returned to the country.

“At that time, the old lady had not been on guard against her. She had even personally opened the lid of the plain jade wooden box in front of her. ”

“The old lady was already eighty-nine years old. If she had snatched it away directly, would the old lady have been able to resist? ”

“But at that time, she did not want to do that. ”

“After all, the old lady was her grandmother. ”

She was the only granddaughter of the old lady.

“She had not come back for ten years, and when she came back, she stole things. Wasn’t that heartbreaking? ”

“Other than these, she also wanted to leave the old lady a happy memory of her old age. ”

She thought of the old lady as her grandmother and put herself in the old lady’s shoes.

But what about the old lady?

What did the old lady do?

“Not only did she hide Suyu, she even poisoned her and killed her! ”

Her own grandmother killed her own granddaughter.

Ridiculous.

Simply Ridiculous.

Feng Ying was very regretful now!

“If she had known this would happen, she would never have cared about the relationship between her and the old lady. ”

“In order to let the old lady live a happy life, she sacrificed her own life. ”

It was not worth it.

It was not worth it!

“Thinking of this, Feng Ying’s expression was close to despair. She held tightly onto the old lady’s Pant leg. “Grandma, I don’t want to die. I really don’t want to die...” ”

“The pain the old lady was in was definitely not less than Feng Ying’s. Other than the blood at the corner of her mouth, she did not show it. She just looked at Feng Ying and slowly smiled. She spoke with some difficulty, “Xiao Ying... Don’t be afraid. I will accompany you on your journey to the Netherworld!” ”

I will pick you up when you come.

I will accompany you when you go.

“After saying this, the old lady slowly closed her eyes. The image of Feng Ying when she was born slowly appeared in front of her eyes, and the curve of her lips became more obvious. ”

This world was indeed very good.

“However, she would never come again in her next life. ”

Never again... Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Ten seconds later, the old lady’s hand drooped weakly. ”

Her pulse also stopped beating.

“Grandma!”Feng Ying cried out in pain.

She was not sad because of the old lady’s loss.

She was worried for herself.

“The old lady had already left, did that mean... ”

She was also finished?

No.

The old lady was definitely not dead.

Feng Ying held her breath and got up from the ground. She pressed the back of the sofa behind the old lady with one hand and slowly reached out to the old lady’s nose with the other.
