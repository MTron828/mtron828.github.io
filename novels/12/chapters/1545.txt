“Zhang Qingqing excitedly grabbed an Lizi’s hand. “Lizi, I’m relieved to hear that from you!””

An Lizi didn’t say anything.

“Zhang Qingqing continued, “Lizi, can you do me a favor?””

“Go ahead.”An Lizi looked at Zhang Qingqing.

Zhang Qingqing drank a mouthful of milk. “Can you help me ask Lin ze out?”

Ask Lin ze out?

“An Lizi subconsciously wanted to refuse, but she felt that it was a little inappropriate. No matter what, Lin Ze had a relationship with this child.”

“”Okay, then can we make it tomorrow?”An Lizi asked.”

“Zhang Qingqing nodded. “Sure, Lizi, thank you!””

An Lizi patted Zhang Qingqing’s hand.

“After leaving the cafe, an Lizi sent Zhang Qingqing back to the hotel and paid for half a month’s hotel fees for her.”

Zhang Qingqing looked at an Lizi’s actions with a sarcastic smile.

“An Lizi was too hypocritical. She had always said that she treated her as a good friend, but she had never taken the initiative to pay for her room. Now that she knew that she was pregnant with Lin Ze’s child, she couldn’t wait to help her pay for her room.”

How disgusting!

Wasn’t an Lizi doing this to curry favor with the Lin family and Lin Ze?

Just wait and see!

“With just the mother and daughter, they would be chased out by the Lin family sooner or later.”

“”Qingqing, you can stay here peacefully. If you need anything, remember to call me!””

“Okay.”Zhang Qingqing nodded.

“After returning, an Lizi made an appointment with Lin Ze on wechat. She said that she had something to talk to him about and asked him to wait for her at the duting cafe tomorrow.”

“Lin Ze was a person who kept his appointment. He was supposed to arrive at 12:30 am, but he arrived at 12:25 am.”

“What Lin Ze didn’t expect was that the person who asked him out was an lizi, but the person who came to attend the appointment was Zhang Qingqing.”

“When he saw Zhang Qingqing, Lin ze frowned slightly.”

“From the beginning to the end, he didn’t have a good impression of Zhang Qingqing.”

Zhang Qingqing sat directly opposite Lin Ze. “Lin Ze.”

“”This seat is taken,”Lin ze said calmly.”

“Zhang Qingqing continued, “I asked Lizi to invite you out.””

“Lin Ze frowned slightly, stood up, and turned to leave.”

“Looking at Lin Ze’s back, Zhang Qingqing continued, “Lin Ze, I’m pregnant.””

Lin Ze’s footsteps did not stop.

“The child is yours.”

Lin Ze stopped in his tracks.

He had no memory of what happened that night. He was alone when he entered the room. Why did Zhang Qingqing suddenly appear in his room?

There was also the blood on the bed.

“Although Lin Ze had never had a girlfriend, he knew what the blood on the bed sheet meant.”

“And now, Zhang Qingqing said that she was pregnant!” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Could it be that they really...

“Zhang Qingqing quickly caught up with Lin Ze. “Lin Ze, I’m pregnant, one month. This is the report form. Take a look.”As she said that, Zhang Qingqing stuffed the report form into Lin Ze’s hands.”

“Looking at the report form in his hands, Lin Ze did not say anything.”

“Zhang Qingqing continued, “The Doctor said that my constitution is special. If I forcefully abort the abortion, it’s very likely that I’ll be infertile for the rest of my life! “I know that you don’t like me, and you don’t welcome this child, but you are the father of this child after all. I want to ask you now, will you accept this child? ! “You have the right to know the existence of this child. Don’t worry, I’m not the kind of person who pesters and pesters. If you don’t accept him, I will immediately leave Beijing and find a place where no one knows me. I will quietly give birth to him. From now on, the child will only have a mother and no father! “We’ll never not appear in front of you in the future!””

“Other people used childhood to heal for a lifetime, but Lin ze used a lifetime to heal his childhood.”

“When he was young, Lin Jincheng lay on a hospital bed. He was brought up by Old Mrs. Lin.”

“At that time, old Mrs. Lin wholeheartedly treated Feng Qianhua as her own daughter. She even asked Lin Ze to call Feng Qianhua mother. If Lin Ze didn’t call her mother, Old Mrs. Lin would give him a hard time.”

That period of time was the darkest moment in Lin Ze’s life.

“Every time he thought about the things that happened when he was young, Lin Ze couldn’t sleep. It wasn’t until later when Lin Jincheng found ye Shu and ye Zao that his life returned to normal.”

“Now, Zhang Qingqing’s words of ‘only mother, no father’deeply stimulated Lin ze. It was as if someone had pinched his heart hard. The pain was heart-wrenching and he almost couldn’t breathe.”

“If the child in Zhang Qingqing’s stomach was really his, he couldn’t turn a blind eye to it.”

He couldn’t let his child experience the darkest moment he had experienced.

“No matter what kind of person Zhang Qingqing was, he couldn’t be irresponsible to his child.”
