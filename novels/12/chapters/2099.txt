How could a lowly person who grew up on Earth have the qualifications to compete with her? Compete with Miss Ye?

It was simply a huge joke.

“After saying that, Duanmu fengyu continued, “After the core robot successfully lands, remember to arrange everything properly and don’t let the cat out of the bag. If those stupid people discover anything, we’ll all be finished!” ”

Wang Meilin nodded. “Don’t worry about that. Just leave it to me.”

The Wang family’s strength was not just for show.

“”Alright, you can leave first. I’ll call you if there’s anything,”Duanmu Fengyu said. ”

“Okay.”Wang Meilin nodded and turned to walk out.

“Duanmu Fengyu watched Wang Meilin’s back as she left. She narrowed her eyes. Suddenly, an idea flashed through her mind. ”

Her mother had been preventing her from going to Earth.

What if... ? ... she asked Wang Meilin to pretend to be her and she pretended to be Wang Meilin?

“Thinking of this, the corners of Duanmu Fengyu’s mouth curled up. She stood up and walked toward her mother’s courtyard. ”

Mrs. Duanmu was admiring the flowers in the back garden.

“Duanmu Fengyu walked forward with a smile, “Mom, are you admiring the flowers? I’m sorry, I was wrong before. I shouldn’t have contradicted you, and I shouldn’t have gone against your wishes. Don’t worry, I know I was wrong. I don’t want to go to Earth anymore.” ”

“”You’d better put away your flowery tricks.”Mrs. Duanmu turned to look at Duanmu fengyu with a cold gaze, “Don’t think I don’t know what you’re thinking! Are you trying to replace the dead with the dead? Let me tell you, I’m your mother! I know you better than anyone else in this world! Duanmu fengyu, if you dare to play tricks in front of me, don’t blame me for being ruthless as a mother!” ”

“If Mrs. Duanmu didn’t have any tricks up her sleeves, she would have long been angered to death by Duanmu Liangchen. Why would she sit firmly on Mrs. Duanmu’s seat for so long? ”

She had thought of doing something extreme in the beginning.

“Then, she thought about why she had to give up her seat to someone else? ”

“Her daughter would be the wife of the Chief Alliance in the future, and she would still have unlimited glory in the future. ”

She wanted her to give up her seat to them?

In their dreams!

“Since Duanmu Liangchen had let her down, there was no need for her to keep Duanmu Liangchen as a virgin! ”

“Mrs. Duanmu had already said this, and Duanmu Feng frowned. “Mom! Why! Why Can’t I go to Earth? Why Can’t everyone else go?” ”

“In the s galaxy, ordinary people could freely enter and leave the various planets. ”

“However, the normal order of the planet must not be disrupted. ”

Earth was the object of absolute protection.

“However, Earth’s civilization was too low-level, and few people were willing to go to Earth. ”

“Mrs. Duanmu looked at Duanmu Feng and said, “Because you are different from them! You Are Duanmu Feng and! You must abide by this rule! Do you know how many pairs of eyes are watching us right now? They are all waiting for you to make a mistake! Do you believe that as soon as you step out of the General Alliance, the Great Elder and the others will discover you? If you don’t believe me, you can try! However, there is no turning back!” ”

It was extremely cold at the top. It was not easy for the Duanmu family to reach this stage. There were too many people waiting outside for their family to make a fool of themselves.

“Hearing this, Duanmu Fengyu was immediately stunned. ”

Mrs. Duanmu’s words woke her up from her dream.

“All this while, she had neglected this matter. ”

She had forgotten that she was the daughter of the Duanmu family.

“”I won’t go.”Duanmu fengyu wiped away the unwillingness on her face. “Mom, don’t worry. I won’t cause any more trouble for the family.” ”

“Mrs. Duanmu sighed and held Duanmu Fengyu’s hand. She said earnestly, “Fengyu, Mom knows that you’re unwilling and that you’re ambitious. However, the daughter of the Duanmu family doesn’t need to be ambitious.” The daughter of the Duanmu family was born at the peak of her life. ”

Duanmu fengyu only needed to be content with the current situation.

“After saying that, Mrs. Duanmu said, “Fengyu, you only need to wait patiently. When the eastern fence is back, you will be the most honorable woman in the S Galaxy.” ”

“Duanmu nodded. “Mom, I understand.” ”

Mrs. Duanmu patted Duanmu Fengyu’s shoulder.

“”By the way, Mom,”Duanmu Feng suddenly thought of something and continued, “How’s the situation with my uncle-in-law?” ”

Mrs. Duanmu shook her head. “It’s not very good.”

Duanmu fengyu frowned. “Are we really going to bring those low-level earthlings up?”

“Whenever she thought about how she had to deal with those Earthlings and acknowledge them as her relatives, Duanmu Fengyu felt disgusted. ”

“”With your aunt around, I don’t think so.”In fact, Mrs. Duanmu was quite uncertain. ”
