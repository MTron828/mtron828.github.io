“Chapter 524: 134: continuous face slapping, large-scale really fragrant scene! 1”

“The daughters of the wealthy families present, who isn’t talented and beautiful? ”

“Not to mention proficient in all kinds of chess, calligraphy, and painting, but the piano is the most basic entry-level musical instrument. ”

But the dignified Lin family’s eldest daughter actually doesn’t even know how to play the piano.

Looks like the rumors are right.

The Lin family’s eldest daughter is really an idiot!

Although she is good-looking.

She didn’t know anything and could only be an embroidered pillow.

“For a moment, there was a flurry of discussion during the banquet. ”

Old Lady Lin’s face became more and more embarrassed.

“A daughter of a wealthy family who usually played well with Feng Xianxian stood up and said, “Miss Lin, it’s okay if you don’t know how to play the piano! I remember that not only does Xianxian know how to play the violin, but she has also passed level nine in piano. A famous teacher produces a good disciple. With Xianxian’s guidance, Miss Lin, you will definitely surpass your teacher.” ”

“At this point, she turned to look at Feng Xianxian. “Xianxian, I believe that you will be very happy to teach Miss Lin, right?” ”

“When she said this, everyone turned their attention to Feng Xianxian. ”

Level nine piano?

This was not something that an ordinary person could do.

No Wonder Old Lady Lin liked Feng Xianxian so much and treated her like the pearl in her palm. It turned out that Feng Xianxian had the ability to do so.

“If it wasn’t for Ye Zhuo, the person standing on the stage would be Feng Qianxian. ”

A young miss of the Lin family suddenly appeared and snatched away all of Feng Qianxian’s things in one night.

“If the young miss of the Lin family really had the ability, then so be it. ”

“Most importantly, this authentic young miss of the same lineage couldn’t even compare to an outsider! ”

Wasn’t this a joke?

She did not know what was going on in Lin Jin city. Why did they let such an outstanding daughter like Feng Xianxian go out to find an idiot.

“Looking at the smug Feng Xianxian, old Mrs. Cen could not wait to pick up the dishes in front of her and slap her in the face. ”

What rubbish!

How could she teach her granddaughter-in-law!

Shameless!

Old Mrs. Cen turned to look at Cen Shaoqing. “Your daughter-in-law is about to be bullied. Don’t you feel anything at all? Hurry up and go help your daughter-in-law!”

“Cen Shaoqing counted the Buddhist beads and said indifferently, “Don’t worry, your granddaughter-in-law is not someone to be trifled with.” ”

Even he had to give in to her.

How could Feng Xianxian gain an advantage in front of her?

“You’re right.”Old Mrs. Cen heaved a sigh of relief. “Our Ye Zi is so powerful. That Little White Lotus can’t even compare to Ye Zi’s hair!”

Feng Xianxian watched the interaction between the old and the young.

“Especially when old Mrs. Cen glanced at her from time to time, Feng Xianxian was extremely excited. ”

“Without thinking, she knew that old Mrs. Cen and Fifth Master Cen were definitely discussing her. ”

From the looks of it.

Old Mrs. Cen was quite satisfied with her.

“Under Old Mrs. Cen’s gaze, Feng Xianxian stood up confidently with a smile on her face. “As long as sister is willing, I will definitely teach you everything!” ”

“Ye Zhuo stood on the stage without any special expression on his face, but his eyes were filled with radiance. “Although I don’t have any musical talent, you... may not be qualified.” ”

“After saying that, Ye Zhuo turned to look at the heiress of a wealthy family who was helping Feng Xianxian. “Since there are people who want to see my musical talent so much, I will satisfy everyone’s curiosity.” ”

“As soon as he finished speaking, there was a moment of silence during the banquet. ”

“What ye Zhuo meant was, she knew how to play the piano? ”

That Idiot who was famous in Yunjing knew how to play the piano?

She probably couldn’t even understand the most basic music score.

Let alone understand any music theory.

“The piano looked simple with only 88 keys, but in fact, there were a lot of tricks involved. ”

It wasn’t something that could be done just by saying it.

An Idiot was an idiot. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“An ordinary person would definitely walk down the stairs at this time and take Feng Xianxian as their teacher. However, ye Zao pretended to be fat. ”

The corner of Feng Xianxian’s mouth curled up slightly.

“Next, she just had to watch ye Zao’s ugly behavior on the stage. ”

As far as she knew.

“The last time the piano club came to look for ye Zao, Ye Zao had said that he did not know how to play the piano and was not interested in it. ”

How could ye Zao learn how to play the piano in such a short time?

It was simply impossible.

Old Madam Cen cheered ye Zao on in her heart.

“If it were not for the fact that ye Zao and Cen Shaoqing had not announced their relationship, she would have even stood up to cheer for ye Zao. ”

Lin Jincheng looked at his assistant beside him. “Go and bring a chair over.”

“Okay.”

The assistant immediately brought a chair and placed it in front of the piano.

“Ye Zhuo sat calmly in front of the piano. Today, she was wearing a plain white gown with long black hair draped behind her head. When she looked down at the piano keys, her beautiful swan neck was exposed, and her skin was as smooth as butter. ”
