Translator: 549690339

“”Momo, have you really thought it through?”Bai Yuanyuan asked. ”

“”I’ve thought it through.”Bai Mo nodded. “I heard that Shi Qingcheng was together with Ye Han. It was Shi Qingcheng who took the initiative to confess to Ye Han, right?” ”

“”I think so.”Bai Yuanyuan’s gossip was very comprehensive, “Moreover, I also heard that Shi Qingcheng and Miss Ye were very good friends. The two of them even had a common experience. I even suspected that Ye Han was embarrassed to reject Shi Qingcheng because of this layer of relationship, so he agreed to be together with Shi Qingcheng! After all, Shi Qingcheng is two years older than ye Han!” ”

“In this world, how many men liked women who were older than them? ”

“Otherwise, why would there be the term ‘Little Wife’instead of ‘old wife’? ”

“Shi Qingcheng is older than ye Han?”Bai Mo was a little shocked.

“Bai Yuanyuan nodded. “That’s right, Mo Mo, you still don’t Know?” ”

Bai Mo did not say anything and narrowed her eyes.

“This way, her chances of winning would be even greater. ”

Shi Qingcheng was just waiting to be kicked!

“Thinking of this, the corners of Bai Mo’s lips curled up, her eyes filled with pride. ”

“”But,”Bai Yuan Yuan hesitated for a moment before continuing, “Isn’t this not too good?” ”

“Although the Bai family was not a top-notch noble family, they were still a reputable family in the s galaxy. If the news of Bai Mo’s involvement spread, the reputation of the few unmarried sisters of the Bai family would also be damaged. ”

“It would be fine if the involvement was successful, but if it was not, they would end up in trouble. ”

“What’s wrong with that?”Bai Mo raised his head to look at Bai Yuanyuan. “Don’t you want to marry into the Xu Family?”

“With just one sentence, he directly pinched Bai Yuanyuan’s weak spot. ”

“Bai Yuanyuan was stunned for a moment. “Mo Mo, Shi Qingcheng came from the military academy. She’s definitely not someone to be trifled with. You have to be careful.” ”

“So what if she’s not someone to be trifled with?”Bai Mo narrowed her eyes.

“To put it bluntly, at this moment, Qingcheng was a tomboy who did not have the slightest bit of femininity. Ye Han would definitely not like such a person. ”

“Bai Yuanyuan was a little worried, but when she thought about marrying into the Xu family, she was a little excited. She continued, “Momo, you and Ye Han were good friends before. Did Ye Han ever tell you what kind of girl he likes?” ”

“At first, Bai Momo only thought of ye Han as ye Zao’s younger brother. She never thought that one day, ye Han would be able to turn from ye Zao’s younger brother to the ruler of Changyue State. ”

“After all, Ye Han was only two years younger than ye Zao. The ruler of Changyue state was not ye Han’s turn. In fact, the most important reason was that ye Han was not ye Zao’s younger brother. They were not blood-related. ”

“Who would have thought that God would be able to predict ye Han’s fate? In the end, Ye Han actually became the ruler of Changyue! ”

“If Bai Mo had known this would happen, he would have taken the initiative to attack long ago. ”

“However, it was not too late. ”

“The corner of Bai Mo’s mouth curled up slightly. He continued, “Actually, Ye Han has always had a crush on someone in his heart. He just didn’t say it out loud.” ”

“Who?”Bai Yuanyuan immediately asked.

“Bai Mo smiled and said, “You don’t need to know who it is. You just need to watch carefully.” ”

Watching who was the last person to smile.

“Bai Yuanyuan finally reacted and said in disbelief, “That... the person ye Han has a crush on isn’t you, right?” ”

Bai Mo didn’t say anything or deny it.

“After all, according to all the signs, that was indeed the case. Otherwise, ye Han wouldn’t have introduced Lin Ze to her. ”

“Bai Yuanyuan said in surprise, “Momo, you’re too amazing! Then I’ll support you! After all, you’re the One Ye Han likes!” ”

“In this way, Shi Qingcheng was the third party who interfered with other people’s feelings. ”

“After Bai Momo redefined her goal, it was as if she had been resurrected. ”

“Over here, three days later, Lin Ze and Bai Jingshu set off for Earth. ”

“Two days later, the interstellar shuttle successfully landed on Earth. ”

“After Lin Ze sent Bai Jingshu home, he contacted Ye Sen and ye Langhua to stay at the Lin family manor tonight. He had something very important to tell everyone. ”

“Ye Sen had been quite busy these days, but when he heard that Lin Ze had something important to announce, he immediately pushed everything aside. He arrived at the Lin family manor at 3:30 in the afternoon. When he arrived, ye Langhua had just arrived. ” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“”Godmother,”Ye Sen greeted with a smile. “You’re here too.” ”

“Ye Langhua nodded. “I was planning to come back in the next few days, but Ah Ze happened to say that he had something to tell us, so I came back early.” ”

“Ye Sen asked curiously, “Do you know what Big News Ah Ze is going to announce to us?” ”

“”I don’t know. I asked that kid over the phone, but he didn’t say anything,”ye Langhua said with a smile. ”
