Translator: 549690339

“Gu dening smiled and said, “Please take a seat, Mr. Wei.” ”

“Wei Liping sat opposite gu dening and continued, “I heard from my aunt that you’re a doctor, Miss Gu? You even cured cancer not long ago?” ”

“Gu Dening told him the truth, “I’m not the one who cured cancer. It’s Miracle Doctor Ye. I’m just basking in the glory of Miracle Doctor Ye.” ”

“Hearing that, Wei Liping was a little disappointed. ”

“He had seen gu dening on the news many times. He had thought that gu dening was the doctor who cured the cancer, but he didn’t expect that someone else had cured the cancer. ”

“Wei liping continued, “Miss Gu, let me introduce myself first. My name is Wei Liping. I’m 33 years old this year and I graduated from a famous University of Finance and Economics in Thailand. I already have a company of my own and my assets are over seven figures.” ”

“Wei Liping was very satisfied with his own qualifications. Because his qualifications were superior enough, he was very strict with the selection of his wife. ”

His qualifications were too low to be accepted.

He could not accept her even if she was ugly.

He could not accept her even if she was not taller than 165.

“Although he was only 173, he was rich. ”

“Girls nowadays were all realistic. As long as they had money, even if he was an old man in his 70s or 80s, there would be a bunch of people who would rush to pay for him. ”

“Gu dening smiled and said, “That Mr. Wei is very outstanding.” ”

“Wei Liping said, “Miss Gu, aren’t you going to introduce yourself?” ”

“Gu dening was not interested in Wei liping and said simply, “My name is Gu Dening. I’m 29 years old and a doctor.” ” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Wei liping continued, “Miss Gu, since we’re already at the age where we should get married, let’s speak frankly.” ”

“Okay.”Gu dening nodded.

“Wei liping continued, “Miss Gu, you’re actually very satisfied with my choice of wife. Now let’s talk about what happens after marriage! “After marriage, we’ll be the male lead and the female lead. I’ll be in charge of earning money to support the family while you’ll be in charge of taking care of the elderly and giving birth. The best age for a woman to give birth is before the age of 30. You’re already 29 this year, so I think it’s best if we have a child within this year.” ”

Gu dening stared at Wei Liping with her mouth agape.

She did not expect to meet the legendary weirdo on her first blind date.

“Wei liping continued, “I’m the only son in our family, so it’s best if you can get a man in one go. I’m fine with that. After all, it’s a new era now. It’s the same whether it’s a boy or a girl, but my parents will definitely be unhappy. They, the older generation, all want to have a grandchild! “However, it doesn’t matter even if you can’t get a man in one go. Our country has already opened up to a second child. At most, we can have a second child.” ”

“”Stop, stop, Stop!”Gu dening made a ‘stop’gesture. “Mr. Wei, it’s just the first time we’ve met. Isn’t it too early for you to say this?” ”

“But you’re already 29.”Wei Liping looked at Gu Dening. “I’m saying this for your own good.”

“After all, it was a woman who gave birth to a child, not a man. ”

“A man could be very childless at any age, but the best age for a woman to give birth was before the age of 30. ”

“GU dening continued, “I’m sorry, Mr. Wei. I think you might be thinking too much. Our worldviews are also quite different...” ”

“This was the first time Wei Liping was rejected by someone, and the other party was a 29-year-old leftover woman! ”

“You don’t like me?”Wei Liping looked at Gu Dening in disbelief.

“GU dening said, “No, that’s not what I meant. I just feel that the two of US might not have much in common.” ”

“Wei liping continued, “Miss Gu, do you really think that you’re that outstanding? You have to understand that you’re already 29 years old this year, not 19 years old! What right do you have to pick and choose? If someone is willing to take you, you should pray for them? !” ”

“There were many people in the cafe, and Wei Liping’s voice was not soft. At this moment, everyone looked over. ”

“Gu Dening’s expression was a little ugly. “Mr. Wei, can you speak with a little more respect?” ”

“”Am I not telling the truth?”Wei Liping looked at Gu Dening, “You’re an old woman who can’t get married. If you could get married, would you still be here? If I didn’t do it for Auntie’s sake, do you think I would come today?” ”

Gu dening was about to explode!

“”Darling! Why are you here?”At this moment, a pleasant male voice appeared in the air. ”

“Before gu dening could react, an arm pressed on her shoulder, and an unfamiliar male scent assaulted her. “Darling, haven’t you told your family about our relationship?” ”
