“Tang mi glanced at Cen Hu and said somewhat speechlessly, “Why are you so far away from me? Can I still eat you?” ”

“Cen Hu said, “That might not be the case.” ”

“”Don’t worry, I’m not interested in men either,”Tang Mi said. ”

“Cen Hu looked at Tang Mi and continued, “Who knows if you’re faking it? After all, there’s a song that says a woman is a tiger.” ”

Which Tiger doesn’t eat people?

Tang Mi:”...”

“Time passed by quickly. In the blink of an eye, a week had passed. ”

Today was the day Bai Jingshu was discharged from the hospital.

“Because it was a natural birth, Bai Jingshu’s recovery was exceptionally good. She hugged the child with both hands, and the corners of her mouth were filled with a gentle smile. ”

“Lin Ze followed behind her, carrying bags of various items. ”

“Most of the items were the children’s diapers, changing clothes, and so on. Bai Jingshu’s items were only a minority. ”

Ye Zhuo drove over to pick them up.

“”Brother, sister-in-law, Dad and mom asked me to pick you up.” ”

“Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “Just let the chauffeur come.” ”

“”How can that be?”Ye Zhuo continued, “Dad was originally planning to come over, but we were too busy at home and couldn’t leave at all.” ”

“Bai Jingshu was discharged from the hospital today. The couple was busy at home and had to handle everything personally. Naturally, they were busier than usual. ”

“Bai Jingshu continued, “She’s just discharged from the hospital. There’s no need to make such a big fuss.” ”

“Let’s go home.”Ye Zhuo opened the car door.

“Bai Jingshu got into the car, and Lin Ze followed behind. ”

“Ye Zhuo drove steadily, but his speed was not slow. Soon, they arrived at the Lin family manor. ”

Lin Jincheng and Xia Xiaoman were waiting at the entrance.

“Seeing ye Zhuo’s car approaching, the two of them immediately went up to welcome her. “Jingshu is back. Where’s the baby?” ” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“”Ah Ze is holding her,”Bai Jingshu said. ”

The two of them immediately took the baby from Lin Ze’s hands. “Look at how cute and handsome the little one is. He’s really becoming more and more like his parents.”

“After seven days of not seeing each other, Little Tiezhu had indeed changed a lot. His skin had become whiter, and his eyes were brighter. ”

“Seeing the two of them like this, ye Zao smiled and said, “Dad, Mom, let’s go in and talk.” ”

“”Yes, yes, yes. Let’s talk inside. Let’s talk inside.” ”

“At this moment, ye Shu turned to look at Bai Jingshu. “Jingshu, we’re going to set off firecrackers later. Don’t scare you.” ”

“Set off firecrackers?”Bai Jingshu asked.

“Ye Shu nodded. “Yes. This is a custom. When a newborn goes home for the first time, they have to set off firecrackers to welcome them.” ”

“”OH.”Bai Jingshu continued, “I’m fine. Will it scare the baby?” ”

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “It’s fine. Boys should be braver.” ”

“You’re right.”Bai Jingshu nodded.

“Before long, the sound of firecrackers filled the air. ”

Crackling.

“Apart from these, there was also a burning brazier. ”

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “Jingshu, cross over.” ”

“Bai Jingshu was very familiar with Earth’s history, so she naturally knew the meaning of crossing the brazier. ”

It was also at this moment that the sound of firecrackers rang out from the child in Ye Shu’s arms.

“He opened his eyes and looked around. He was not scared to tears by the sound of firecrackers, and his eyes rolled around. ”

“Ye Shu was immediately amused, “We’re home. Our Little Tiezhu has returned home. Let’s see if Grandpa and Grandma have prepared a children’s room for him! “Oh, right, our Tiezhu is still too young. It’s not suitable for him to live in a children’s room alone. We still have to have our parents live together.” ”

“Bai Jingshu was still in the middle of her pregnancy. After returning home, she went straight to the bedroom to rest. ”

Lin Jincheng called Lin Ze Downstairs.

“Ah Ze.”

“”Dad, What’s the matter?” ”

“Lin Jincheng continued, “Have you contacted Grandpa Jingshu in the past few days?” ”

Lin Ze nodded. “I have.”

The old man was very happy to hear that Bai Jingshu had successfully given birth.

“Lin Jincheng continued, “I’ve discussed it with your mother. It’s not easy for an old man to live his entire life. Why Don’t you go and bring the old man over to take a look at his great-grandson?” ”

“Lin Ze did not directly answer Lin Jincheng’s question. Instead, he said, “I’ve thought about this before, but grandfather is really too old. It’s not convenient to go back and forth. If something happens along the way...” ”

“Lin Jincheng nodded in understanding. “Then, go upstairs and discuss it with Jingshu. Let’s see what she has to say.” ”

“Okay.”

“After Lin Ze returned to his room, he told Bai Jingshu about this matter. ”

“Hearing this, Bai Jingshu was silent for a moment. Then, she said, “Dad and mom are thoughtful. They can still think of My Grandpa.” ”

“Then.., bai Jingshu continued, “Grandpa is old. It’s definitely not realistic to come here. So, I plan to take the baby home after the full moon and stay with Grandpa for a while. You Go and ask Dad if this is okay.” ”

“The child was too young. It was only a month, and rashly bringing him to Galaxy S would take a lot of risks. This matter had to be discussed with the family. ”

“Lin Ze nodded. “Okay, then I’ll call mom and Dad up. We’ll discuss it together.” ”

“Okay.”

“Regarding this matter, Lin Jincheng and Ye Shu were of course supportive, but they were also afraid that the child was too young to adapt to the environment there. ”

“Why don’t we ask burning.”Lin Jincheng said.
