This was something that Wang Jianguo was very worried about.

“Although the LIN Group’s stock had always been on the rise, Lin Jincheng looked too calm.”

“He did not go around asking for help, nor did he look for any bank loans.”

Could it be that he did not want to save himself?

This did not seem like the performance of a person who was about to go bankrupt.

He was afraid that Lin Jincheng still had some tricks up his sleeve.

“Zhou Dawei patted Wang Jianguo on the shoulder and said with a smile, “Brother Wang, don’t worry! Lin Jincheng is now a turtle in our jar. He can’t run away!””

“Not only did the few old shareholders withdraw their capital, but they also took away many of the technical personnel of the LIN Group.”

The Lin Group had no money and no one.

What could they use to operate?

The black card that ye Zao gave Lin Jincheng?

“Thinking of that black card, a look of disdain appeared on Zhou Dawei’s face again.”

“Seeing Zhou Dawei’s confidence, Wang Jianguo also heaved a sigh of relief.”

“Perhaps, he had thought the matter too seriously.”

The Lin Group had suffered such a heavy blow. How could they possibly get up in such a short time?

“Zhou dawei continued, “Brother Wang, just stay at home and wait for Lin Jincheng to declare bankruptcy! When that time comes, the entire household industry will be ours!””

Wang Jianguo nodded.

...

Old Lady Lin had been waiting for Lin Jincheng to come over and apologize to her for the entire day.

“However, in the evening, there was no sign of Lin Jincheng.”

But Old Lady Lin was not worried at all.

“In her opinion, Lin Jincheng was struggling on the brink of death.”

Just wait.

“At the last moment, Lin Jincheng would definitely come looking for her.”

“At this moment, Feng Xianxian walked to Old Lady Lin’s side. “Grandma, I just finished eating. Shall I accompany you downstairs for a walk?””

“Okay.”Old Lady Lin nodded.

Feng Xianxian brought Old Lady Lin Downstairs.

This apartment belonged to the luxurious and luxurious district of the capital. There were many shopping malls beside it.

“Feng Xianxian and Old Lady Lin walked around the shopping malls. On their way back, they bumped into Lin Jincheng and ye Shu walking over.”

“Feng Xianxian pointed over there and said, “Grandma, do you think that’s uncle Lin and Auntie Ye?””

What were Lin Jincheng and ye Shu doing here?

They must be here to apologize and beg for Old Lady Lin’s forgiveness.

Feng Xianxian didn’t expect ye Shu to still dare to approach Old Lady Lin at a time like this.

Wasn’t this adding fuel to the fire?

Just wait.

Old Lady Lin might humiliate ye Shu in a while!

“Hearing this, Old Lady Lin immediately looked over and her eyes lit up. “It’s them!””

It was already past seven o’clock at night.

Old Lady Lin had thought that Lin Jin Cheng was tough.

She did not expect that Lin Jin Cheng would still be afraid.

“Since he had come, so be it.”

He had actually brought that b * Tch Ye Shu along. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Seeing ye Shu, Old Lady Lin’s eyes were filled with disgust. She turned to look at Feng Xianxian and instructed, “Xianxian, you are not allowed to intercede for them later. This time, I must show them something!””

“Feng Xianxian frowned. “Grandma, this is your family matter after all. It’s not appropriate for an outsider like me to stay here. Why don’t I Leave?””

“Who says you’re an outsider!”Old Lady Lin pulled Feng Xianxian’s arm. “You’re the granddaughter of an old lady like me!”

“Grandma!”

“You’re not allowed to leave!”

Old Lady Lin’s attitude was very firm. Feng Xianxian had no choice but to ‘reluctantly’stay.

“Old Madam Lin stood straight and waited for Lin Jincheng and ye Shu to come over and kowtow to her to admit their mistakes. At the same time, she was thinking about how to choose her words.”

Ye Shu also saw Old Madam Lin and turned to look at Lin Jincheng. “Your mother is there. Should we go up and say Hello?”

“Lin Jincheng looked over. “Feng Xianxian is here too, right?””

“I think so.”Ye Shu nodded.

Lin Jincheng frowned. “Just pretend that you didn’t see her. There’s no need to greet her.”

“Alright.”Ye Shu respected Lin Jincheng’s intentions.

The couple continued walking over.

Old Madam Lin’s back straightened.

“Today, she had to get that B * tch, Ye Shu, and her little bastard out of the Lin Family!”

“If a tiger didn’t show its might, did it really think that she was a sick cat?”

“One by one, they all climbed onto her head!”

“Seeing that the couple was getting closer and closer, Old Lady Lin turned to look at Feng Qianxian. “Qianxian, you can’t take the initiative to greet them later! You have to let them call us first.””

“This time, Lin Jincheng was begging her.”

Old Lady Lin didn’t want Feng Qianxian to suffer the slightest grievance.

Feng Qianxian nodded.

“Just as Old Lady Lin was ready to see Lin Jincheng and ye Shu kneel down and apologize to her, the couple turned a corner and walked right past them.”
