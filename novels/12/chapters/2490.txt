“I don’t want to play anymore either. My eyes are getting sore.”Li Yueyue yawned.

“An Lizi said, “I don’t want to play anymore either. When will searing flame have time to play again?” ”

“”It depends on the situation.”Ye searing continued, “If you see me online, just invite me directly.” ”

“Okay.”

“Soon, the few of them dispersed. ”

“After song Shiyu logged out, he opened the video app on his phone. ”

There were eleven video recordings.

All of them were from the match just now.

He recorded every match.

Song Shiyu clicked on the send cloud to save.

“”Boss.”At this moment, his assistant knocked on the door. ”

“Come in.”Song Shiyu put down his phone.

“The assistant came in from outside the door. “Boss, Dr. Liu is here.” ”

“”Let him come over,”song Shiyu said calmly. ”

“Okay.”The assistant nodded and turned to walk downstairs.

“Dr. Liu stood downstairs and brought the assistant down. He immediately asked, “How is it? is boss song done with his work?” ”

“”He’s done with his work. Boss wants you to go up,”the assistant said. ”

“Okay.”Doctor Liu nodded and walked upstairs.

Song Shiyu had returned to his usual nonchalant look and was sitting on the boss’chair.

“Doctor Liu raised his head and looked at him. He couldn’t help but think, was the man who was sitting there playing games really song Shiyu? ”

“After a moment, doctor Liu walked to Song Shiyu, put down the medical kit, and continued, “Boss song, have you felt any discomfort recently?” ”

“”No, everything is fine,”song Shiyu said as he stretched out his wrist. ”

Doctor Liu stretched out his hand to check song Shiyu’s pulse.

“Song Shiyu’s pulse was indeed good, and there were signs of improvement. ”

“Doctor Liu smiled and said, “Boss song, you must persevere. According to this progress, you will soon recover.” ”

“Yes.”Song Shiyu nodded slightly.

“Doctor Liu took out two bottles of medicine from the medical box and said, “Boss song, this medicine has the effect of relieving pain. It doesn’t have any side effects. If you really can’t Stand the pain at night, you can take one.” ”

“”No Need,”song Shiyu directly refused. ”

“Doctor Liu continued, “The further you go, the more painful your symptoms will be. Please keep the medicine.” ”

Song Shiyu did not say anything. He only nodded slightly.

“Doctor Liu kept the medical kit. “Mr. Song, I’ll be going back first.” ”

“Go.”

“Doctor Liu turned around and left. Song Shiyu seemed to have suddenly thought of something and said, “Doctor Liu, wait a moment.” ” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Do you have anything else?”Doctor Liu looked up at Song Shiyu.

“Song Shiyu continued, “Go and find the butler.” ”

“Okay.”Doctor Liu did not ask why.

“When he arrived downstairs, he saw the butler standing there waiting for him. ”

“Doctor Liu.”

“Butler Song.”

“Butler song smiled and said, “Doctor Liu, come with me.” ”

“Okay.”Doctor Liu nodded and followed Butler song’s footsteps.

“The two of them walked one after the other. Doctor Liu suddenly quickened his pace and walked shoulder to shoulder with Butler song. He lowered his voice and said, “Butler song, how is Miss Chen Now?” ”

“When he heard this, the Butler was momentarily stunned. Then, he sighed and did not know what to say to Doctor Liu. ”

“Something happened to Miss Chen?”Doctor Liu realized that something was not right and asked.

“Butler song continued, “Miss Chen is gone.” ”

Gone?

Doctor Liu frowned. “What do you mean by Gone?”

“Butler song sighed again. “Sigh, maybe this is fate!” ”

Doctor Liu was stunned. He couldn’t get out of Butler song’s ‘gone’sentence.

How could Chen Siyao be gone!

“Butler Song.”Doctor Liu turned to look at Butler song. “This is not something to joke about.”
