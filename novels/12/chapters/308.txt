Chapter 309: 104: Fifth Master woke up and fell in love with her

Translator: 549690339

“Ye Zhuo did not think too much about it. Although Old Mrs. Cen had always said that she wanted to set her up with Cen Shaoqing, she had not mentioned it for a long time. Moreover, Cen Shaoqing was someone who could see through the mortal world. ”

Even if she could not control Cen Shaoqing’s manhood.

Cen Shaoqing did not have the heart to do so.

It was very obvious.

“It was impossible between them. Just like what old Madam Cen said, there was no need to treat CEN Shaoqing as a man. ”

Cen Shaoqing sat in the driver’s seat and turned to look at Ye Zao. “Get in the car.”

“Coming.”Ye Zao opened the car door and got into the car.

Ye Zao was still wearing that white swimsuit.

The action of leaning into the car was just right in front of Cen Shaoqing’s eyes.

This familiar scene made Cen Shaoqing hurriedly look away.

His ears were slightly red.

“The fabric of this swimsuit was too little. Not only was his waist and legs exposed, if he leaned over, he could also see... ”

“Fortunately, there were no other men on the island besides him! ”

“To cover up the awkwardness, CEN Shaoqing immediately started the engine and drove away. ”

“Soon, they reached the beach. ”

“Ye Zhuo opened the trunk, took out the tent and beach umbrella, and prepared to set up camp. ”

Cen Shaoqing took the beach umbrella from her hand. “You go and swim. I’ll take care of these things.”

“Can you do it by yourself?”Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows.

“”No problem,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “Then I won’t stand on ceremony with you.” ”

“No need to stand on ceremony.”

“Ye Zao really didn’t stand on ceremony with Cen Shaoqing. He walked around the beach, even though he was standing on a reef and jumping into the sea. ”

Bang —

His perfect figure was completely hidden in the blue sea water. His body was agile like a mermaid from the deep sea.

Ye Zao liked to dive freely. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

She liked the feeling of dancing with fish in the deep sea even more.

“Unfortunately, in her previous life, she could only play in artificial sea water. It was not easy to meet the real sea, so of course she had to have fun. ”

The only flaw was that she could only hold her breath for eight minutes at a time.

If only it could be longer.

Ye Zhuo swam to a group of colorful sea fish.

“These fish looked very good, and the taste must be very good. ”

But they were too small.

“There were too many small fish bones, so they could only be used for viewing. ”

“Suddenly, ye Zao saw a fat and beautiful grouper. ”

He swam over quietly and directly locked the grouper’s throat!

“After catching a fish, he just happened to float to the surface to breathe, and he also sent the fish back. ”

On the beach.

“Cen Shaoqing had already set up the tent, and the tent and beach chair had been set up. At this moment, Cen Shaoqing was lying on the beach chair, twirling Buddha beads. ”

“At this moment, footsteps suddenly appeared in the air. ”

“Cen Shaoqing slowly opened his eyes and saw ye Zhuo walking over with a fish in his hand. “Fifth brother, do you think this grouper is fat? This kind of grouper is the best for roasting and eating! It can also be sashimi...” ”

“You caught it?”Cen Shaoqing’s eyes revealed a hint of surprise.

“It was the hardest to catch fish in the deep sea, especially this kind of grouper that was particularly strong. ”

“If one was not a professional diving fish hunter, it would be very difficult to catch fish in the deep sea with one’s bare hands. ”

Could it be...

That it was dead?

“”Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly. “By the way, did you bring a bucket? I’ll raise the fish. The weather is too hot, so don’t stink later.” ”

“There seems to be one in the car.”Cen Shaoqing turned around and went to get a bucket.

Cen Shaoqing brought a bucket over.

Ye Zao took the bucket and filled it with seawater. He put the grouper in. The fish that was already dead began to plop when it came into contact with the water.

It was not dead.

Cen Shaoqing raised his eyebrows slightly.

It seemed that.

He had underestimated ye Zao.

“Since she could catch snakes with her bare hands, she could catch fish in the deep sea with her bare hands. ”

“After settling the grouper, Ye Zao looked up at Cen Shaoqing. “Aren’t you hot wearing so much?” ”

The temperature at the seaside was almost 40 degrees Celsius.

“The Sun was scorching hot, but Cen Shaoqing was still wearing his long robe. He was as elegant as a teacher who had traveled back from the Republic of China. ”

Cen Shaoqing held a Buddhist bead in his hand. “I was born this way. I don’t feel cold or hot.”

Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly. “There’s such a Thing?”

“Yes.”

“Ye Zao continued, “Let me check your pulse.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing stretched out his hand and rolled up his sleeves slightly, revealing his strong wrist. “It just so happens that I haven’t been feeling well recently. Help me take a look.” ”

Ye Zao stretched out his hand and placed it on his wrist.

“It was obviously July or August, but his hand was a little cold. ”

Yet his pulse was no different from an ordinary person’s.

This was a little strange.

“Having lived for two lifetimes, this was the first time ye Zao had seen someone with such a physique. ”

Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly and quickly let go of his wrist.
