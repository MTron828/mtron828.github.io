“Elder Zhang turned to look at Si lui. “A Lui, this calligraphy piece was left behind by President Yu?” ”

Si lui nodded. “Yes.”

Elder Zhang rubbed his chin in puzzlement. “When did this old man Yu’s taste become so low?”

Low Taste?

“Si lui creased his brows and continued, “I heard that someone once spent 100,000 yuan to buy this calligraphy piece from President Yu, but President Yu didn’t agree.” ”

This was also a counterattack against elder Zhang’s words.

It was clear that elder Zhang didn’t know how to appreciate it.

“If his taste was really low, why would someone spend 100,000 yuan to buy it? ”

“”100,000 yuan?”Elder zhang said in surprise, “Is this person blind?” ”

Si Lu maintained his smile and tried his best to control the anger in his heart. “Perhaps everyone has different eyes.”

“Ye Zhuo didn’t join in the conversation. He walked to an old-fashioned record player and stopped. He reached out and fiddled with it a few times, and then an ancient music came out from the loudspeaker, “The south wind blows and the nightingale sings softly... Only the fragrance of the Night Comes...” ”

“Old Zhang smiled and turned around. “Zao Zao, you like to listen to old songs too?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly. “Old songs have a lingering charm.”

“Old Zhang continued, “I thought only US old men like old songs! I didn’t expect you young people to like them too.” ”

“The lawyer looked at his watch and continued, “It’s almost time for the board meeting. Elder Zhang, Miss Ye, shall we go to Miss Zhao’s office first?” ”

“”Alright.”Elder Zhang nodded and turned to look at Ye Zao. “Zao Zao, let’s go then.” ”

In the meeting room.

A total of 26 directors had almost all arrived.

“At this moment, the meeting room was filled with discussions. ”

“I wonder what Xue Yin called us here today to discuss!”

“I heard that elder Ye’s great-granddaughter has returned! Xue Yin called us here today because of this matter!”

“Really? Why didn’t I know?”

“”If other people don’t know about this matter, elder Zhang definitely knows!” ”

“Elder Guo turned to look at elder Zhang. “Elder Zhang, what exactly is going on? Is it really elder Ye’s descendant that has returned?” ”

“Elder Zhang smiled and said, “Keep it a secret.” ”

“”What’s there to keep a secret about? If it’s not, then it’s not!” ”

Elder Zhang remained mysterious.

Creak —

“At this moment, the door to the meeting room was pushed open. ”

“Everyone turned around and saw Zhao Xueyin walking in from outside. Zhao Xueyin walked to the front of the rostrum and placed her hands on the table. She leaned forward slightly and said with a smile, “Good afternoon, board members and uncles.” ”

“Someone immediately said impatiently, “Xueyin, ah! We’re all on the same side, so there’s no need to talk about formalities. Quickly tell us, why did you suddenly call us all together? Is there something important you want to announce?” ”

“”Elder Guo is right! Xueyin, just get straight to the point!” ”

“”Yes, yes, yes! get straight to the point!” ”

“Zhao xueyin smiled and said, “Since uncles are so impatient, then I’ll make it short! Today, I called all uncles here to introduce the new president of our consortium to everyone. As for who the new president is, I’m sure all uncles have heard about it... ... .. ”

Who is the new president?

“In the entire Shunxi Consortium, besides elder Sun’s granddaughter, Sun Yiran, who else was most qualified to be the president? ”

However.

It was very obvious.

The new president that Zhao Xueyin was talking about wasn’t Sun Yiran.

“But if it wasn’t Sun Yiran, who else could it be? ”

Could it be...

“Before Zhao Xueyin could finish her sentence, elder Guo interrupted her impatiently, “Could it be that this new president is elder Ye’s great-granddaughter?” ”

“Hearing this, everyone looked at Zhao Xueyin with anticipation. ”

“After all, Old Ye had single-handedly taken over the Shunxi Financial Group. ”

“Although the current Shunxi Financial Group had Zhao Xueyin overseeing it,. ”

Zhao Xueyin’s name wasn’t legitimate.

How many shares did Zhao zhenfei have?

It was most suitable for the successor of Old Ye to take over the Shunxi Financial Group.

Old Ye had single-handedly founded the Shunxi Financial Group back then.

Ye Langhua was a talented woman whose fame shook the capital.

The descendants of the Ye family definitely wouldn’t be too bad.

Everyone was filled with anticipation for ye Zhuo!

“Seeing the expectant expressions on the directors’faces, Zhao Xueyin couldn’t help but furrow her brows. ”

This bunch of heartless old fogeys.

“If it weren’t for her, the Shunxi Financial Group would have long collapsed! ”

Who would still remember her now?

Drinking water and not forgetting to dig a well. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

They were so good.

“Now that they heard that ye Zao was coming back, their faces immediately changed. ”

Just you wait.
