Translator: 549690339

“Soon, Ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing returned to half a month.”

Aunt Lang came over with two bowls of ginger soup. “It’s raining heavily outside. I’ve made some ginger soup. You two should drink some ginger soup to drive out the cold.”

Although the two of them took advantage of the umbrella.

They were holding an umbrella. One of them would definitely get caught in the rain.

“”Thank you, Aunt Lang.””

Ye Zhuo took the ginger soup with both hands.

Cen Shaoqing also took the ginger soup with both hands.

“Aunt Lang smiled and said, “After drinking the ginger soup, you can eat the old duck vermicelli soup. By the way, searing, scallion, ginger, garlic, and coriander, is there anything you don’t Eat?””

“”I eat them all.”Ye Zhuo turned to look at Cen Shaoqing. “Cen Shaoqing, what about you?””

“I can also eat them all.”Cen Shaoqing opened his thin lips slightly.

Aunt Lang was stunned.

Cen Shaoqing was not a vegetarian?

“Other than not eating meat, vegetarians were not allowed to eat onions, ginger, and garlic.”

“Aunt Lang said in surprise, “Shaoqing, you’re not a vegetarian anymore?””

“I’m not eating anymore.”

“Aunt Lang continued, “Then you and Zhonghuang, you two?””

“Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “Aunt Lang, I forgot to tell you that I’m with Zhonghuang.””

“Really?”Aunt Lang’s eyes were filled with disbelief.

“Although when she first met ye Zao, Aunt Lang could tell that Cen Shaoqing treated ye Zao differently.”

“But when she saw Cen Shaoqing admit that he was together with Ye Zao, Aunt Lang was still shocked beyond words.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Aunt Lang had known Cen Shaoqing for many years.

She had once thought that Cen Shaoqing would become a real monk.

“It seemed that it was really a case of braised water and tofu, one thing begets another.”

“Of course it’s true.”

“Aunt Lang smiled and said, “Congratulations. In the future, when you two hold a wedding, you must treat Aunt Lang to a wedding banquet!””

“”Yes, Aunt Lang.””

“After a while, Aunt Lang came over with the cooked old duck vermicelli soup and placed some vinegar and chili oil on the table, “Sear Sear, if you like spicy food, you can add some chili oil. This chili oil is made by myself. You Can’t buy it outside.””

“”I don’t like anything without spicy food.”As he spoke, ye Zao scooped up a large spoonful of chilli and placed it in the bowl. Then, he added a spoonful of fragrant vinegar into the bowl.”

“After placing the vinegar and chilli, he mixed the chopsticks well. Chilli oil floated on the bright yellow old duck soup. A seductive fragrance wafted out, causing people to swallow their saliva.”

“Aunt Lang smiled and said, “When I was young, I also liked to eat chilli.””

Xiao Banyue also liked to eat chili.

A three-year-old child was not afraid of spicy food. A bowl of old duck vermicelli soup with half a tablespoon of chili oil.

“When she thought of this, a hint of a smile appeared in Aunt Lang’s eyes. It was fleeting, but it was quickly replaced by an inexplicable sadness.”

She had been waiting here for more than thirty years.

She had been waiting for more than thirty years.

She did not know if she could wait for the rest of her life until Xiao Banyue.

“Seeing that she was about to lose control of her emotions, Aunt Lang smiled and said, “Zhuo Zhuo, Shaoqing, you guys eat first. I’ll go to the kitchen to take a look. If you need anything, you can just call out.””

“”Okay, Aunt Lang.””

“Aunt Lang walked into the courtyard. As soon as she turned around, Aunt Lang took out a handkerchief to wipe her eyes.”

“At this moment, the sound of footsteps came from the courtyard.”

Aunt Lang was immersed in her own emotions and didn’t hear the sound of footsteps.

“Auntie.”

“Aunt Lang finally reacted. She looked up at the person and asked in surprise, “Weiyue, why are you here?””

“XI weiyue said softly, “Auntie hasn’t been back for a long time. My parents are very worried about you, so they asked me to come and see you. By the way, my mother also asked me to bring you some nutritional supplements. Drink it while it’s hot.””

Xi Weiyue said as she helped Aunt Lang into the house.

Auntie Lang stopped in her tracks. “There are guests inside. Let’s go to the west wing.”

Guests?

Xi Weiyue took a look inside the room.

“Through the layers of beaded curtains by the window, Xi Weiyue could vaguely see a tall figure. Her facial features could not be seen clearly, but the imposing aura on her still could not be concealed.”

She did not need to think to know that this must be a big shot!

Xi Weiyue narrowed her eyes.

“”Aunty, who’s inside?”Xi Weiyue asked.”

“Aunt Lang said, “Two guests eating.””

“OH.”Xi Weiyue nodded.

Guests eating?

“Of course, she knew it was the guests eating.”

“What she wanted to know was, who were the guests eating.”

“Unfortunately, ye Langhua did not seem to understand what she was saying.”

There were so many big shots in the capital.

“For a moment, Xi Weiyue really could not guess who the person eating in the inner room was.”

Could it be someone from the Shunxi Financial Group?

“They had always suspected that ye Langhua was related to the Shunxi Financial Group, but they just could not find any evidence.”
