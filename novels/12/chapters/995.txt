“Chapter 996: 225: became a legend of ranidou, Ye Zao was actually Dr. YC! 2”

Translator: 549690339

“C country was a weapons country, its citizens were allowed to carry guns, and there was serious racial discrimination, so the security was not as good as in the country.”

“Ye Zao was just a little girl, and she did not speak C country’s language. If anything happened, she would not even have a place to cry.”

“Moreover, ye Zao came out with her.”

“If anything really happened to ye Zao, Cen Shaoqing would definitely be the first to look for her!”

“When the time came, who would bear the responsibility?”

“Professor Yue continued, “Although English is the world’s common language, there are not many people who speak English in C nation. Xiaoxue’s English and Hindi are both very good. I feel more at ease with her by your side.””

Ye Zhuo was not Tang Xue.

“Tang Xue knew Hindi and also knew self-defense techniques. With Tang Xue by Ye Zhuo’s side, Ye Zhuo would definitely not be bullied. Otherwise, ye Zhuo would definitely be at a disadvantage. Of course”

“Ye Zhuo said, “Professor Yue, you don’t have to worry. I know Hindi, so I won’t trouble Miss Tang.””

Know Hindi?

“Hearing this, Professor Yue was stunned.”

Hindi was known as one of the top ten most difficult languages to learn in the world.

Ye Zao knew Hindi?

He was definitely bragging.

“Although he knew that ye Zao was bragging, professor Yue could not directly discredit ye Zao. No matter what, Ye Zao was still Cen Shaoqing’s girlfriend, “Miss Ye, although you know Hindi, you’re not familiar with C Nation after all. If anything were to happen, you would have someone to take care of you, right?””

“Tang Xue looked at Professor Yue with a smile. “Professor Yue, since Miss Ye wants to go out on her own, then you should let her go alone! Miss ye is not a child, she knows her limits.””

“This was C Nation, and Ye Zhuo was a single woman with a foreign face. It would be strange if nothing happened while walking on the streets of C Nation!”

“When she thought of that scene, Tang Xue felt extremely happy.”

She had really tolerated ye Zao for too long along the way.

“At this moment, when she heard that ye Zao wanted to go out alone, Tang Xue wished that she could leave immediately and disappear on the spot.”

“Professor Yue nodded. “Alright, then Miss Ye, you can go. If there are any problems, remember to call us immediately.””

“She had already explained the problems that needed to be explained, and she had also said what needed to be said. Ye Zao insisted on leaving, so there was nothing she could do.”

Ye Zao was an adult after all. She could not let her find a rope to tie ye Zao up.

“Looking at Ye Zao’s back, Tang Xue smiled and said, “Professor Yue, you don’t have to worry about Miss Ye. Miss ye is so powerful. Nothing will happen to her.””

“Professor Yue nodded. “It’s best if nothing happens.”If something really happened, Cen Shaoqing could not blame her.”

...

C country was a very beautiful country.

It was the beginning of autumn in C country. The streets were lined with golden fallen leaves. It looked very artistic.

Ye Zhuo took two photos with his phone.

“At this moment, his phone suddenly rang.”

Ye Zhuo picked up the phone slowly. “Hello.”

“”Don’t panic, I’ll be there soon.””

“After hanging up the phone, Ye Zhuo reached out to hail a taxi. “Please head to ranidou.””

“As soon as he said that, the driver looked behind him. A look of obvious surprise flashed across his eyes.”

He did not expect that a girl from the east could speak Hindi so well.

“Okay.”

“After a while, the driver asked curiously, “Beautiful Lady, are you Chinese?””

“Ye Zao’s tone was shallow. “I’m Chinese, not Chinese.””

The driver was stunned.

He had thought ye Zao was of Chinese descent when he saw how good ye Zao’s Hindi was.

“So you grew up in C Nation?”The driver asked again.

“Not really.”

Not Really?

Then this little girl was too amazing.

“The driver said, “Your Hindi is really good. From your accent, I thought you were a local!””

“Thank you.”

“The driver adjusted the course and asked uncertainly, “By the way, did you say you’re going to Ranito?””

“Ranito was the largest casino in C Nation and the largest casino in the world. There were all kinds of people in it, and it really didn’t seem like a place for a little girl. That was why the driver asked again.”

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“After confirming that there was no problem with the address, the driver entered the address.” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Half an hour later, the taxi stopped at the east gate of Ranidou. The driver turned to look at ye Zao. “Beautiful miss, I wish you good luck.””

“Ye Zao thanked him, then took out a pair of sunglasses from his pocket and put it on his face. Then, he pulled the hood of his hoodie over his head and walked into the casino.”
