Translator: 549690339

Ye Zhuo could not help but laugh.

One could imagine that the CEN old lady and Cen Old Man also had a great time.

“After saying that, cen old lady continued, “I’m telling you so much now, but you won’t understand! You’ll know when you get married! Oh right, where’s the fifth girl? Why didn’t I See Him? Didn’t you say that he also returned to the country?” ”

“”He went to buy food,”ye Zao said. ”

“”OH.”Old Mrs. Cen nodded and sighed, “This old saying is not wrong at all. When you add salt to the water, you add tofu to it, and one thing subdues another. Ever since I got to know you, this fifth girl has become a completely different person.” ”

...

On the other side.

“After doctor Li returned to his office, a few doctors immediately came over to inquire about the situation. “Doctor Li, I heard that Miracle Doctor Ye’s surgery for her uncle went very smoothly. How is it? has she woken up yet?” ”

Doctor Li shook his head. “I’m afraid he’ll never wake up.”

“He’ll never wake up?”

“Yes.”Doctor Li nodded.

“Doctor sun immediately said, “But isn’t Miracle Doctor Ye a miracle doctor? Why would he never wake up?” ”

“Doctor Zhao, who was beside him, said, “Don’t forget that Miracle Doctor Ye is only an expert in the oncology department.” ”

A doctor from the oncology department went to the surgery department to perform surgery.

Was this not a joke?

“”You’re right.”Doctor Sun continued, “Fortunately, Ye Sen is Miracle Doctor Ye’s uncle. Even if the doctor really dies, he won’t have any relatives to cause trouble for him. If it were any other patient, they would definitely cause trouble!” ”

“Doctor Sun lowered his voice and said, “Actually, I think that Miracle Doctor Ye is using Ye Sen as an experiment.” ”

“What do you mean?”

“Doctor Sun continued, “Just like what little Zhao said, we’re all family. Even if something happens to ye Sen now, no family member will find trouble with Miracle Doctor Ye!” ”

“Actually, Ye Zao was not treating Ye Sen at all. ”

She was using the excuse of treating ye Sen’s illness to conduct human experiments.

“Shhh!”Doctor Zhao immediately made a ‘Shush’gesture. “You can’t say such things!”

Miracle Doctor Ye’s name had a lot of influence in China.

“If such words were to spread, the consequences would be unimaginable. ”

Using a living person as an experiment?

It was simply terrifying!

“Doctor Sun continued, “Don’t worry, I’m just saying it in front of you guys.” ”

In Ye Sen’s ward.

“Zhou Xiang was chatting with ye Shu when she suddenly received a phone call. “Hello, Wanyin.” ”

“Okay.”

“After hanging up the phone, Zhou Xiang looked at Ye Shu. “I’m really sorry, Mom. I might have to go out for a while.” ”

“Ye Shu said, “It’s fine, it’s fine. You can go back to work.” ”

“Old Madam Cen looked up at Zhou Xiang. “Xiang Xiang, where are you going?” ”

Zhou Xiang’s expression was a little complicated. “There’s someone over there.”

Over there.

Old Madam Cen instantly understood. “Then you can go.”

“Okay.”Zhou Xiang nodded and walked out.

At the airport.

A pretty girl was holding an old lady and waiting at the airport entrance.

The old lady looked to be in her eighties. Her skin was a little yellowish and her cheekbones were a little high. She looked a little difficult to get along with.

“”Yinyin, is your aunt here yet?” ” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Zheng Wanyin shook her head. “She doesn’t seem to be here yet.”

The old lady frowned. “Why isn’t she here yet? Did you tell her that we’re already waiting?”

“”Yes.”Zheng wanyin continued, “Aunt might be busy. Let’s just wait a little longer.” ”

The old lady was a little unhappy. “I think she just doesn’t take us to heart.”

“”Grandma, please don’t think that way.” ”

“Just then, Zheng Wanyin suddenly saw a familiar figure in the crowd. “Aunt is here!” ”

“Zhou Wanyin waved at Zhou Xiang. “Auntie, this way.” ”

“Zhou Xiang jogged over. “Mom, Wanyin.” ”

“That’s right. This old lady who didn’t seem to be easy to get along with was Zhou Xiang’s mother, Xie Wanqiu. ”

“However, Xie Wanqiu wasn’t Zhou Xiang’s biological mother. ”

She was a stepmother.

“Zhou Xiang’s biological mother passed away when she was fifteen. Three years later, her father married Xie Wanqiu. ”

Xie wanqiu glanced at Zhou Xiang. “Why are you so late?”

“Zhou Xiang explained, “There was a traffic jam on the road. Let’s go quickly! Right, Mom, you and Wanyin haven’t eaten yet, right? Let’s Go Eat First.” ”

“Zheng wanyin said, “Auntie, grandma and I have already eaten on the plane.” ”

“”That’s good.”Zhou xiang continued, “Then let’s go to the hotel.” ”

“Where do you think we’re Going?”Xie wanqiu looked up at Zhou Xiang.

“Zhou Xiang said, “A hotel.” ”

“Xie wanqiu said angrily, “Do you think I came all the way from Wuzhou to the capital just to stay in a hotel?” ”
