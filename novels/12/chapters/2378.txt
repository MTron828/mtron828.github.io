Lin Ze’s attitude was really too cold.

This was a little out of Bai Mo’s expectations.

“Logically speaking, Lin Ze’s attitude towards her shouldn’t be so cold. ”

“”Brother-in-law, I...”Bai Mo considered her words in her heart. She looked pitiful and helpless. “I, I haven’t been able to contact my sister yet. Can you help me contact her?” ”

She wanted to see how Bai Jingshu was going to explain to Lin Ze how she was going to chase her back from the Lin family.

“Lin Ze continued, “Because of this?” ”

“Yes.”Bai Mo nodded.

“”I can’t contact your sister because she’s too busy. An adult should be responsible for their own actions,”Lin Ze continued. “Jingshu is only one year older than you. She doesn’t have to be responsible for you.” ”

“The other meaning behind his words was that even Bai Jingshu could do well on earth, so why couldn’t Bai Mo? ”

Bai Jingshu didn’t have the responsibility to take care of Bai Mo..

“Hearing this, Bai Mo’s expression was a little complicated. ”

She had never expected Lin Ze to answer her like this.

He... was still angry.

Bai Mo bit her lip. She was already humble enough in front of Lin Ze. She didn’t hesitate to personally come to Earth for Lin Ze to be with these lowly people.

But what about Lin Ze?

Lin Ze actually treated her like this.

Wasn’t love a two-way street?

“Bai Mo couldn’t stand such grievances. She looked up at Lin Ze and continued, “Lin Ze, I know you’re still angry with me, but I’ve already realized my mistake. I even came to Earth to look for you personally. You...” ”

“Lin Ze frowned slightly and interrupted Bai Mo., “Bai Mo, I think you might have misunderstood something. “That’s right. You were indeed the one who went on a blind date with me in the beginning, but neither of us took a liking to each other. In My Eyes, you’re Jingshu’s cousin. The person I love the most is Jingshu. “Please put on a proper posture. Everyone should know their place.” ”

Bai Mo’s face turned pale immediately. Her face was filled with disbelief.

What did Lin ze say?

Did he mean that he had never loved her?

Impossible!

This was impossible!

“If Lin Ze did not love her, how could he have found Bai Jingshu. ”

Bai Jingshu was clearly her substitute.

“”You’re lying to yourself!”Bai Mo continued, “I know you like me!” ”

“Lin Ze frowned impatiently and continued, “You shouldn’t be called Bai Mo. You should be called Daydreaming.” ”

His words were emotionless. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“”I’m not daydreaming!”Bai Mo looked at Lin ze and said, “If you don’t like me, why did you look for Bai Jingshu? Lin Ze, why can’t You Face Your Feelings! “I didn’t mean to reject you in the past. I just wanted to test your sincerity towards me. Now that I’ve seen it, I know that you love me!” ”

“Lin Ze was most afraid of this kind of person pestering him. He lowered his head to look at his watch and spoke again, “I’ll say it again. Please stop daydreaming. “I’ve never liked you. The person in my heart has always been Jingshu. “As for you, you’re not even comparable to Jingshu’s little finger in my heart. Do you understand?” ”

“After saying this, Lin Ze turned around and left without any hesitation. ”

Bai Mo was stunned and didn’t know how to react.

How could it be...

How did things suddenly turn out like this?

“She loved Lin Ze, and Lin Ze loved her. Why couldn’t two people who loved each other be together and torture each other? ”

No..

She couldn’t give up like this.

Lin Ze was hers.

The position of the mistress of the Shangguan family was also hers.

No one could take it away from her.

Bai Mo watched Lin Ze’s back. She didn’t know where she got the courage to chase after him.

She wanted to hug Lin ze tightly and tell him that she couldn’t live without him.

“Lin Ze!”

“Just as Bai Mo was about to hug Lin ze from behind, Lin Ze suddenly dodged. ”

Bang.

Bai Mo missed and fell to the ground.

“Lin Ze looked at Bai Mo and continued, “Bai Mo, since you’re Jingshu’s cousin, I won’t argue with you today. I Won’t argue with you if you know your place. You must have a sense of shame, especially when it comes to girls.” ”

His words were cold and merciless.

Bai Mo fell to the ground and looked at Lin Ze. Tears almost came out of her eyes.

“”Lin Ze, I know I’m wrong! “I shouldn’t have treated you like that in the past. Can You Forgive me for once? “I don’t mind if you marry Bai Jingshu. I can even give up my status. For You, I’m willing to do anything. I just want you to forgive me.” ”
