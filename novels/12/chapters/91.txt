Chapter 92: 074: strength slaps the face, stunning everyone! 6

“I want to buy one too.”

Ye Zao said, “Let’s have a group chat? I’ll send you their website in a while, but their dresses have to be reserved in advance.”

After the red carpet mode ended, ye Zao went to the audience seats.

Seeing ye Zao come over, Lin Sha was extremely excited. “Zao Zao, you were so cool, so handsome, so beautiful just now!”At first, Lin Sha was really worried for ye Zao, but she did not expect ye Zao to actually turn the tables!

He won so beautifully!

He directly crushed Mu Yourong!

Seeing this made her blood boil, and she even became very interested in chess.

“Zao Zao! Why are you so powerful!”

Ye Zao touched his chin and said seriously, “Maybe it’s because I’m good-looking?”

Lin Sha said excitedly, “Yes, yes, yes! I’ve seen it all, and all the female streamers present are not as good-looking as you! I don’t know what’s going on with Mu Yourong either. I used to think that she was quite good-looking, but now that I look at her again, I suddenly realize that she has become so ugly... ”...”. ”...”

Ye Zhuo had initially only wanted to be a little narcissistic. He did not expect that Lin Sha would be so supportive.

However, Mu Yourong was rather strange.

Especially when she was playing chess with her just now.

Ye Zao narrowed his eyes. She felt that there was a bug in Mu Yourong.

Otherwise, how could such a beautiful person suddenly become so gloomy?

“Zao Zao, what are you thinking about?”Seeing ye Zao wandering in outer space, Lin Sha waved her hand in front of her eyes.

“Nothing.”Ye Zao stopped thinking.

Lin Sha continued, “I just saw my Prince Charming, Young Master Yun, also came. I really wanted to ask him for an autograph! Unfortunately, there were too many people, I was too embarrassed to go...”

“Young Master Yun? Which Young Master Yun?”Ye Zhuo was confused.

“It’s Yun Shen! Look, he’s sitting there!”Lin Shasha pointed at the man sitting in the first row.

The man was wearing a suit.

He looked very familiar.

Ye Zhuo suddenly thought of the popular TV series. If she remembered correctly, this person should be the male lead in the series.

“If you like it, then go. It’s okay! Sister Shasha, what are you afraid of? He won’t eat people,”ye Zao continued.

“I, I’m afraid...”

Lin Shasha had never attended such a high-end party before. This was her first time.

Everywhere she looked, she saw big shots on TV or in newspapers. Lin Shasha felt that she was too small.

“It’s okay.”Ye Zhuo smiled at her. “Sister Shasha, we’re all human. He just has one more layer of celebrity status than you. You Don’t have to be afraid.”

Hearing this, Lin Shasha’s uneasy heart instantly calmed down. She mustered up the courage to ask Yun Shen for an autograph.

Just as ye Zhuo said.

Celebrities were also ordinary people.

Yun Shen was very amiable. Not only did he give her an autograph, but he also took a photo with her.

Lin Shasha was very happy. She even posted it on her wechat moments to show off.

Three hours later, the party officially ended.

Ye Zhuo and Lin Shasha went outside. Because the dress had the effect of adjusting the temperature, they didn’t feel cold even though they were wearing a coat.

“Hello, Are You Miss YC?”At this moment, a pleasant male voice came from behind them.

Ye Zao looked back slightly. “May I ask who you are?”

The man was about 1.8 meters tall and looked very pleasing to the eyes. He had a standard warm male face.

The kind that could make a bunch of little girls scream.

“My name is Zheng Zijun, and I’m also a live streamer of Miao Yin platform! You were very outstanding on stage just now. Can we add you on wechat and get to know each other?”After saying that, Zheng Zijun looked at ye Zao nervously.

In the past, it was always others who took the initiative to hit on him. This was the first time he hit on someone.

Nothing else.

It was only because ye Zao was too beautiful.

Zheng Zijun had become famous earlier and had seen all kinds of beautiful women.

But it was the first time he had seen someone like ye Zao.

Although the person who was hit on was Ye Zao, Lin Shasha was very excited.

Zheng Zijun was a Super V!

The two of them stood by the roadside. One was extremely handsome, while the other was as beautiful as a painting.

It was hard not to notice them.

Cen Shaoqing, who had just gotten into the back seat of the car, saw this scene immediately. His hand that was holding the Buddha beads suddenly stopped. He looked up and ordered the driver, “Stop over there.”

The driver looked in front of him.

Wasn’t that little girl from yesterday?

Look at Master Five’s expression.

Was He... jealous?

He did not expect that there would be such a day for master five CEN, who was known for not getting married.

The driver covered his mouth and snickered while scratching his itch.

After ye Zhuogang and Zheng Zijun added each other on wechat, a low-key Maybach stopped in front of her.
