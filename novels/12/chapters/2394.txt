“Keating said, “Destroy those alien creatures immediately!” ”

“Mario laughed out loud, “I think you’re a spy sent by YC!” ”

“”Mr. Mario! Please wake up. If something really happens, none of us can bear the responsibility!”Keating frowned deeply. ”

“Mario faced the crowd and said, “All of you, those who support kading, stand on the left. Those who support me, stand on the right.” ”

“After saying that, the crowd began to discuss among themselves, before consciously standing on the left and right sides. ”

“After all, Mario was the highest leader of the base, so there were quite a few people who supported him. ”

“Furthermore, there were only a few people who supported kading. ”

These people were all old colleagues of Kading and had worked for many years.

“Just like Kading, they saw a crisis in the calm. ”

“If things really reached a point where they couldn’t control themselves, there would be no turning back. ”

“Mario continued, “Since ancient times, the minority has followed the majority. Now, I announce that the experiment continues!” ”

Kading was so anxious that his face had turned red. “Mr. Mario! You’ll regret it!”

“Mario looked at kading and said, “If you’re not convinced, the door to the laboratory is right there. All of you can leave at any time!” ”

“Kading’s heart was filled with anger. He had worked at the base for decades. If he were to really leave, he would be a little reluctant to do so. ”

“However, if he didn’t leave, he would be extremely depressed. ”

“Mario continued, “Since you’re not leaving, then I have no objections. Meeting adjourned.” ”

“After saying that, Mario continued, “Nick, come to my office.” ”

Nick nodded and followed Mario’s footsteps.

Everyone looked at Mario’s back with a complicated expression on their faces.

“Kading turned around and said, “All of you have chosen such an outcome. You will definitely regret it one day!” ”

“”Dr. Kading, with your timid personality, you will never be able to achieve anything great!” ”

“The expression on Dr. Kading’s face was extremely complicated. He wanted to say something, but he knew very well that it did not make sense to these people, so he could only endure it. ”

“”Kading, what do we do now?”Jack walked to Kading’s side and asked in a low voice. ”

“Kading frowned and said, “Let’s go back to the lab first.” ”

“Okay.”Jack followed Kading’s footsteps.

The group walked into the lab. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

At the hua base.

Dr. Zhang had received the news that Lzhou was not willing to cooperate to destroy the alien creatures.

Dr. Zhang frowned slightly and immediately went to tell ye Zao the news.

“Hearing this, Ye Zao’s expression did not change significantly. He continued, “Is the news reliable?” ”

Dr. Zhang nodded. “It’s very reliable!”

“Ye Zao continued, “Connect me to Mario.” ”

“”Okay, Miss Ye, please wait a moment.”Dr. Zhang immediately went to make arrangements. ”

Mario did not find it strange at all when he received ye Zao’s invitation.

This was all within his expectations.

Did Ye Zao really think that he was an idiot? That he would fall for it.

“The assistant looked at Mario and asked, “Sir, do you want to contact Doctor YC?” ”

Mario nodded.

“Alright.”

The assistant immediately went to handle it.

“Very soon, Mario’s figure appeared on the other end of the screen. ”

“Ye Zao sat in his office. “Hello, Mr. Mario. I’m YC.” ”

Mario stood up from his chair. “Dr. YC.”

“Ye Zao did not beat around the bush and went straight to the point, he continued, “Mr. Mario, after testing, our laboratory discovered that your research base had sent over a biopsy sample that contained dangerous ingredients. We recommend that you use potassium carbonate to destroy it immediately! Otherwise, it will bring about a devastating blow!” ”

“”Doctor YC, I know that you’re thinking about our L continent. I appreciate your kindness.”Mario smiled as he looked at Ye Zhuo, “However, none of us know the final result. Scientific research is a process of continuous research and hard work. If we don’t even have the courage to do research, how can we use scientific research to change the world?” ”

“Ye Zao had not even done any research, so how could he determine whether the result was good or bad? ”

He could not just rely on his mouth.

“Ye Zao was still young and could not hide anything. If she had used a different method, he might have been able to listen to her. ”

“However, ye Zao had said that there was something dangerous about it. Wasn’t this an alarmist? ”

Did he really think that he would be so easily fooled.

“Ye Zao’s expression did not change. “Mr. Mario, I hope that you can listen to my face carefully. If you don’t cooperate with me and destroy it, if you really end up regretting it, there’s no return button for you to press.” ”
