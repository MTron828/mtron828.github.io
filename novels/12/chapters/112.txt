Chapter 113: 077: setting people up, burning online, birthday party scene 6

In this life, he also wanted to do his best to do something for those homeless children.

He went to the welfare institute in advance to understand the situation. Ye Zhuo bought a total of more than five hundred down jackets that the children wore.

He bought some toys.

On the way to the orphanage, ye Shu asked curiously, “Burning, what do you mean by Mu Yourong and her mother coming to our house today? Are they really here to give us new year presents?”

“Of course not.”

“Then what do they want?”Ye Shu asked.

Ye Zhuozhuo said slowly, “Mu Yourong’s real goal should be for me to attend the song family’s old lady’s birthday banquet together with her.”

Ye Shu frowned. “She definitely doesn’t have good intentions! Zhuozhuo, you’re not allowed to go!”

“It’s fine, Mom.”Ye Zhuozhuo hugged ye Shu’s arm. “It’s Just Mu Yourong. I’m not afraid of her.”

Ye Shu was still a little worried.

In the circle of the rich and powerful, it was neither chaotic nor chaotic. Ye Shu was afraid that ye Zhuo would be bullied.

Ye Zhuo comforted ye Shu. “Mom, I grew up in that circle. Don’t worry, I know how to do it. This banquet is rather important to me. I definitely have to attend.”

Hearing Ye Zhuo say this, Ye Shu could only compromise. “Then you must bring your phone with you when the time comes. When you see that the situation isn’t right, quickly call me.”

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded. “I know.”

In the blink of an eye, it was the day of the banquet.

Ye Zao was dressed well when he arrived at the apartment block. He saw that the Mu family’s car was already parked there.

Mu Yourong was wearing a down jacket over her gown. She stood outside and waited for ye Zao. “Sister Ye Zao.”

It was almost the new year, and it was also the song family’s old lady’s birthday banquet today, so ye Zao wore a wine-red gown.

It was a very simple style, and it was a little out of the ordinary.

But it was worn by ye Zao, and it gave off a high and mighty international air!

Mu Yourong frowned slightly.

Ye Zao was really going all out for beauty. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

It was such a cold day, yet she did not even put on a down jacket outside!

Why didn’t she freeze to death?

Since there was a free car, ye Zao naturally would not refuse. He directly walked forward, sat in the car, and said to Mu yourong outside, “We can set off now.”

Mu Yourong:”...”was she the car owner, or was ye Zao the car owner?

But now was not the time to argue with ye Zao.

Mu Yourong also sat in the car and instructed the driver to open the door. Then she asked with concern, “Sister Ye Zao, don’t you feel cold wearing so little?”

Ye Zao smiled faintly. “Doesn’t miss mu know about the temperature-adjustable gown?”

“Temperature-adjustable gown?”Mu Yourong frowned.

No Wonder Ye Zao’s expression did not change.

It turned out that he was wearing a high-tech product.

These past few days, she had also known about the temperature-adjustable gown, but because she had to make an appointment, she had not been able to buy it.

Could it be that ye Zao had connections?

“Sister Ye Zao, where did you buy this gown?”

Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly. “You want to buy it?”

Mu Yourong really did not want to lower her head in front of ye Zao, but at this moment, she had no choice but to nod and take out her phone. “This is the one.”

Ye Zao glanced at it and said in a flat tone, “Five million.”

Mu Yourong’s money would not go to waste!

“Five million?”Mu Yourong’s eyes widened.

Although ZY’s official website did not list the price of this gown, their most expensive gown was only six figures, so how could it be sold for five million?

Ye Zhuo nodded. “Why? Do you think it’s too expensive? This is a design designed by ZY Group’s top designer! If you don’t buy it, a bunch of people are waiting in line!”

The weather was getting colder and colder.

Once the system was upgraded, MU yourong could rebroadcast and reappear in front of Fifth Master Cen. However, she was so bloated and wrapped like a dumpling, so how could she show her beauty in front of Fifth Master Cen?

Mu Yourong really liked this set of clothes. When she thought about how she had made an appointment for over ten days but still had not been able to get one, mu yourong continued, “Are you sure that you can buy it with five million?”

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo’s tone was shallow. “Give me the money today and the goods will arrive tomorrow.”

“I’ll get my assistant to transfer the money for you.”

It was just five million.

When she married Fifth Master Cen, forget about five million, even if it was fifty million, five hundred million was nothing.

The corners of Ye Zhuo’s lips curled up.

It was still easier to earn money from a fool.

For the sake of five million, ye Zhuo decided to treat mu yourong a little better in a while.

Not long after, the car stopped in front of the song family’s manor.

Today was the song family’s old lady’s birthday banquet. The song family’s interior and exterior were decorated with a very festive atmosphere.
