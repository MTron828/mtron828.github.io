Translator: 549690339

Lin Qingxuan couldn’t handle the trivial matters at home.

“Hearing Xia Xiaoman’s voice, she was very excited. ”

Xia Xiaoman was finally back. She immediately carried the child and walked out.

“Hearing this, Zhou Cuihua and Li Hang looked at each other and saw the speechless and disgusted expressions in each other’s eyes. ”

Why did Xia Xiaoman come back at this time.

Why was she back?

“Although she was very unhappy, she still put on a show. ”

Zhou cuihua also stood up with a smile.

“In the next second, Xia Xiaoman’s figure appeared in front of them. ”

“She bent down to change her shoes, and the nanny took the bag from her hands. ”

“When Xiao Lin Zhi saw that his mother was back, he was so excited that he immediately jumped off Lin Qingxuan’s body and cheered, “Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy!” ”

It was a very pleasant baby voice. It was so cute that it melted people’s hearts.

Xia Xiaoman picked up Xiao Lin Zhi and kissed him on the cheek. “Did Ah Zhi listen to Daddy obediently today?”

“”Yes, Ah Zhi was very obedient today.”Xiao Lin Zhi hugged Xia Xiaoman’s neck tightly. “Mommy, I love you!” ”

Xia Xiaoman’s face was full of smiles.

“She didn’t know who Lin Zhi had followed. Clearly, neither of them were the kind of people who could speak sweet words, but Xiao Lin Zhi was very good at talking. ”

Zhou Cui Hua followed. “Xiao Man is back.”

“Li hang followed behind and called out, “Cousin.” ”

“Xia Xiao Man looked up at the two of them and said with a smile, “Cousin is here! I was telling Hang Hang about you yesterday! Come in and have a seat!” ”

“Zhou Cui Hua said with a smile, “I had something to do yesterday and couldn’t get away, so I came to tell you today. “I heard from hang hang that Lizi’s boyfriend is a talented man with a graceful bearing. There’s no such thing as heaven and earth. Congratulations, Xiaoman.” ”

“At the end of her sentence, Zhou cuihua sighed and said, “Xiaoman, you’ve finally made it.” ”

This sentence could be said to be quite meaningful.

“Xia Xiaoman smiled and said, “It’s not as exaggerated as you say. That Kid Ouyang is just an ordinary person. They can solve their young people’s problems by themselves. As elders, we only want the younger generation to be happy and happy.” ”

“You’re right.”Zhou cuihua nodded. “That’s why I often tell this kid hang hang hang that he doesn’t need to pick anything else when he finds a partner. As long as his character is good!”

Zhou Cuihua looked at Xia Xiaoman with a fawning smile on her face.

“Behind this fake smile, there was intense jealousy and jealousy. ”

“Back then, Xia Xiaoman was not as well-off as him. Although she started a supermarket with an Dongliang from scratch, she was still not as good as him. ”

What about now?

“Xia Xiaoman had already become a rich lady, but she still looked the same as before. ”

Comparing people was really infuriating.

“Yes.”Xia Xiaoman nodded in agreement. “You’re right. Nothing is more important than character.”

Zhou Cuihua was stunned.

“She thought that Xia Xiaoman would take the opportunity to ask Li Hang if he had a boyfriend now and then answer that he did not. Then, she could take the opportunity to ask Xia Xiaoman to introduce someone to Li Hang. ”

“After all, Xia Xiaoman was now a rich lady from a wealthy family. The circle of contacts was different, and the people she interacted with were also different. Therefore, the People Xia Xiaoman introduced to Li Hang were definitely all sons of influential families. ”

Who would have thought that Xia Xiaoman would actually not follow the usual pattern.

“Everyone said that one person achieved the dao, and the whole family ascended to heaven. ”

“Xia Xiaoman, on the other hand, became a rich lady from a wealthy family, and completely ignored their relatives. ”

This was too much!

“The smile on Zhou Cuihua’s face did not change. She continued, “Speaking of which, Hang Hang is older than Lizi! Lizi has already found a boyfriend, but she’s still single! I don’t know what to do!” ”

“Since she had already said this much, Xia Xiaoman should be able to understand, right? ”

“Xia Xiaoman did not directly answer Zhou Cuihua’s words. Instead, she handed Lin Zhi to Lin Qingxuan. “You hold Ah Zhi.” ”

“”Okay.”Lin Qingxuan took over Lin Zhi and smiled. “Come, let Daddy Hug You.” ”

“Actually, Lin Zhi was quite unwilling to let his father hug him. However, seeing that his mother was busy, he could only force his father to hug her. ”

“Xia Xiaoman continued, “I’ll chat with my cousin for a while. You Take Ah Zhi to the amusement park to play for a while, and then arrange lunch for him.” ”

“”Okay.”Lin Qingxuan nodded and then asked, “Cousin and the others don’t have any taboos, right?” ”

“Looking at the way the couple got along, Zhou Cuihua thought of her husband who was like a proud old master at home and couldn’t help but be envious. ”

She didn’t expect the wealthy businessman to be so rich and have such a good temper. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com
