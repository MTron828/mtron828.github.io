Translator: 549690339

This person was really too terrifying.

“Bai Jingshu looked at Chen Yaosheng and said word by word, “Chen Yaosheng, your appearance really makes me sick.” ”

Very sick.

Very sick!

Sick?

Chen Yaosheng was stunned.

What did Bai Jingshu discover?

“”Jingshu! You really misunderstood me!”Chen yaosheng continued, “Did someone say something in front of you?” ”

“”Stop pretending.”Bai Jingshu looked at Chen Yaosheng, “I know everything. You stole the Yuan dynasty records from the library, and you didn’t write the transcript on it! Chen Yaosheng, you’re a hypocrite! From now on, we’ll never speak to each other again!” ”

“At the end of her sentence, Bai Jingshu closed the door. ”

Bang!

“Chen Yaosheng was isolated outside the door. Without any chance to explain, he frowned. ”

How did this happen?

How did Bai Jingshu know about all this?

Who was the one who told Bai Jingshu?

“Also, how did he leak the truth about taking out the Yuan dynasty records from the library? ”

“Logically speaking, all of this should have happened without anyone knowing. ” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

What exactly happened to Bai Jingshu during the time he was away?

“Chen Yaosheng was not willing to let everything he had worked so hard for be broken just like that. He stood at the door and shouted, “Jingshu! Listen to my explanation. Things are not what you think! Can you open the door? Let’s talk it out in person!” ”

“Bai Jingshu was about to be conquered by him, but now, the cooked duck had flown away. ”

Bai Jingshu wore earphones and sat in the study to sign autographs. She isolated herself from all the noise from the outside world.

“Chen Yaosheng stood at the door for more than two hours. There was no movement in the room, so he had to leave temporarily. ”

“As soon as Chen Yaosheng left, he received a call from Bai MO. . ”

Bai Mo appeared on the transparent screen in the air and smiled at Chen Yaosheng. “How was Mr. Chen’s confession today?”

“Based on the current progress, Bai Jingshu should have already been taken by Chen Yaosheng. ”

“Next, Bai Mo just needed to focus on conquering man Wen. ”

“Don’t mention it!”Chen Yaosheng’s face was full of unhappiness. “I don’t know what’s wrong with Bai Jingshu. She actually wants to stay away from me forever!”

“Seeing Chen Yaosheng like this, Bai Mo frowned slightly. “What’s going on? You’re not joking with me, right?” ”

“Logically speaking, things shouldn’t have progressed to this stage. ”

Chen Yaosheng explained the whole process.

“Hearing that, Bai Mo continued, “How did this happen?” ”

“I don’t know either.”Chen Yaosheng was still very confused. He didn’t know what was going on. “Who’s the one who’s so nosy!”

“Bai Mo continued, “Don’t be anxious. You’re both on Earth anyway. If the soft approach isn’t enough, we can still use the hard approach.” ”

“Use the hard approach?”Chen Yaosheng asked.

“”Yes.”Bai Mo nodded and continued, “According to my understanding of Bai Jingshu, she’s a more traditional woman. She places more importance on her chastity. If you can... That’s not a bad idea.” ”

Bai Jingshu was old-fashioned and didn’t know how to be flexible.

“Because of this, Bai Jingshu suffered quite a lot when she was a child. ”

“Hearing this, Chen Yaosheng narrowed his eyes. ”

“Actually, compared to his body, he hoped to obtain Bai Jingshu’s heart. ”

“But if he could not obtain Bai Jingshu’s heart, he could only... ”

“”Okay, I understand.”Chen Yaosheng nodded. ”

“Bai Mo continued, “Mr. Chen, don’t be too anxious. Some things need to be done step by step.” ”

“Okay.”

“After hanging up the phone, Chen Yaosheng was indeed not as anxious as before. In any case, he had other ways. ”

The most important thing for him now was to find out what Bai Jingshu saw during the time he was away.

On the other side.

Shi Qingcheng and Ye Han set off for home.

Ye Shu prepared a lot of delicious food for them to bring along.

“”Godmother, thank you!”Shi Qingcheng hugged ye Shu and said reluctantly, “Godmother, although I’ve only lived with you for less than half a month, I feel that you’re even closer to me than my own mother! I really can’t bear to part with you!” ”

Shi Qingcheng had never experienced motherly love before.

“In the past, she did not even understand what motherly love was, but through this period of time together, she completely understood it. ”

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “If you can’t bear to part with me, you can always come back to visit godmother. The door of the house will always be open for you.” ”

“Okay.”

“Lin Jincheng smiled and replied, “You can’t bear to part with your godmother, right? Godfather is just a tool.” ”

“”No, no, of course not!”Shi Qingcheng smiled and said, “Godfather is the best godfather in the world.” ”
