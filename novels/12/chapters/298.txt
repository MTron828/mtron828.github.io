“In the past, he didn’t know where his mother was, so it was understandable that he had nowhere to go. ”

“Now that he knew that his mother was in Yun Jing, he had to go. ”

Until he found his mother.

“Dog Two hesitated for a moment before continuing, “Brother Ze, what if… I said what if… What if your mother is already married in Yun Jing and has a family of her own? What would you do?” ”

This wasn’t the first time dog two had asked this question.

“”Then I’ll take a look from afar and not disturb them,”Lin ze answered the same way as before. ”

“Fat Tiger frowned. “So, in other words, even if you know that your mother already has a family, you still have to go?” ”

“Yes.”Lin Ze nodded.

He didn’t expect that his mother would never get married after so many years.

That was unrealistic.

“After all, everyone had feelings and desires. ”

All he needed to do was to look at his mother from afar and he would be satisfied.

“Li Wen patted Lin Ze on the shoulder. “Brother Ze, don’t worry. I believe that you will definitely be able to find Auntie.” ”

“”Right, we also believe in her,”said dog two and fat tiger. ”

Lin Ze didn’t continue this topic. He turned his gaze to the motorcycle beside him. “Shall we play?”

“”Sure.”Buttface immediately stood up, picked up the helmet hanging on the motorcycle, and put it on his head. ”

“Before long, four fast motorcycles appeared on the Winding Mountain Road. ”

The rumbling sound shook the entire mountain.

They chased each other.

All kinds of difficult moves were performed one after another.

No one lost to each other.

But it was obvious that the blue motorcycle was better!

This adrenaline rush made Lin ze temporarily forget all his worries.

After a long time.

The four motorcycles slowly stopped.

“Fat Tiger took off his helmet, turned his head and said, “Brother Ze, Buttface, Mozzie, I heard that CSBK will be held in Beijing in October. Why Don’t we sign up?” ”

“Really?”Buttface asked.

“”Of course it’s true!”Fat tiger continued, “My cousin told me personally. It Can’t be wrong!” ”

Fat Tiger’s cousin was also a motorcycle enthusiast.

“Buttface said, “CSBK like this only needs to enter the top three to win the award. I want to sign up.” ”

“Li Wen followed, “Then I want to sign up too!” ”

“”What About You, brother Ze?”Fat Tiger looked at Li Ze. ”

Lin Ze was sitting on the blue motorcycle. He had one foot on the ground and was holding a helmet in his hand.

He was a 19-year-old youth. He exuded a youthful aura from head to toe.

He looked.

A little cool.

“Count me in too.”

Fat Tiger nodded. “Okay! We’ll participate together then!”

At around 5 pm in the evening. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Lin Ze returned home.

Feng Qianhua was standing at the door.

It seemed like she was waiting for him.

Lin Ze frowned slightly and was about to walk past Feng Qianhua.

“Feng Qianhua suddenly reached out her hand to block in front of Lin Ze. “Ah Ze, I want to talk to you.” ”

“I have nothing to talk to you about.”Lin Ze frowned.

He really did not like Feng Qianhua.

He did not like her from the start.

He even felt disgusted.

“Feng Qianhua pretended to be very infatuated. She had waited for Lin Jin city for so many years, but it was not for the Lin family’s power. ”

If Lin Jincheng was a poor boy with nothing…

Would Feng Qianhua still be so ‘affectionate’?

“With such a low standard, only Old Lady Lin would be deceived! ”

“”It’s about your mother,”Feng Qianhua continued. ”

“Hearing this, Lin Ze stopped in his tracks. ”

“Feng Qianhua knew that she had grasped Lin Ze’s weakness. She continued, “Let’s talk over there.” ”

“After saying that, Feng Qianhua walked into the garden. ”

Lin Ze followed her footsteps.

Feng Qianhua walked to the Stone Table in the garden and sat down.

“”Ah Ze, you sit too.” ”

Lin Ze leaned over and sat down.

“Feng Qianhua looked at Lin Ze and sighed. “Ah Ze, I know that you have never liked me. You think that I want to steal your father away…” ”

“Before she could finish her sentence, Lin Ze interrupted her. ”

“”Isn’t That So?”Lin Ze looked up slightly, his eyes filled with sarcasm. ”

Feng Qianhua choked. She didn’t expect Lin Ze to be so disrespectful to her.

But Lin Ze was only a 19-year-old child.

“A child. Even if his mind was mature, he wouldn’t be able to outplay her! ”

She was waiting for the day when Lin Ze would willingly call her mother!

“With that thought in mind, Feng Qianhua felt a little better, she continued, “Ah Ze, you’ve misunderstood me. In fact, I was your father’s fiancée in the beginning. We were childhood sweethearts. It was your mother’s appearance that disrupted the peace and separated your father and I! “If it wasn’t for her, I would be your father’s legitimate wife now!” ”
