“The next day, Li Ziyu finally returned home after going through a lot. ”

“When Li Ziyu left home, he was 27 years old. Now, he was 30 years old. Standing in front of Li Sanzhu and Fang yinyue, if he didn’t call his parents, they wouldn’t recognize him. ”

“He became darker, more mature, and more stable. ”

“Ziyu!”Fang yinyue hugged Li Ziyu. “You’re finally back!”

“”Mom.”Compared to three years ago, his mother didn’t seem to have changed much, but it seemed like she had changed a lot. Time had changed. ”

“After a while, the mother and Son released each other. Li Ziyu turned to look at Li Sanzhu. “Dad.” ”

“It’s good that you’re back.”Li Sanzhu patted Li Ziyu’s shoulder.

Li Ziyu looked around. “Where’s Yueyue?”

“”She should be at the back.”Fang yinyue wiped away her tears and said to the butler, “Butler, go get the young lady.” ”

“Okay.”The butler nodded.

“At this moment, Li Yueyue’s voice sounded in the air. “Brother!” ”

Li Ziyu turned around and saw Li Yueyue rushing over. “Yueyue.”

“Before Li Ziyu could react, Li Yueyue jumped onto Li Ziyu’s body. ”

Li Ziyu hugged his sister.

“Tears filled the eyes of the siblings. They had not seen each other for three years, and all their words were in tears. ”

“After a while, Li Sanzhu said, “That’s enough, Ziyu. Let’s talk about it tonight. Come with me to see your grandmother now.” ”

“Okay.”Li Ziyu nodded and followed his father’s footsteps.

...

“After ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing returned to the capital, they distributed the specialties they brought back from the grasslands to their relatives at home. ”

“Then, Ye Zhuo made another trip to the base. ”

“Just as he arrived at the base, Yu Zifei arrived. ”

“After resting for two months, Yu Zifei’s mental state was extremely good. “Miss Ye.” ”

“When he saw Yu Zifei, Ye Zhuo looked up in surprise. “Team leader Yu, why are you here?” ”

There was only one month left on the three-month holiday. Yu Zifei should not have appeared at the base at this time.

“Yu Zifei looked at ye Zhuo and continued, “Miss Ye, I request to come back to work after the New Year and officially enter work mode.” ”

“Come back to work after the New Year?”Ye Zhuo glanced at him. “But you still have one month left on your holiday. Are you sure you want to come back to work?”

“The annual leave started on the afternoon of the 30th of the New Year and continued until the 8th of the first lunar month. Even if Yu Zifei came back to work after the new year, he still had nearly one month left on his holiday. ” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“”Yes, I’m sure.”Yu Zifei nodded very seriously. ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Have you discussed it with your family?” ”

“Yes.”

“”That’s fine.”Ye Zhuo flipped through the documents. “After the New Year, I’ll arrange for you to work in the defense team. Coincidentally, the defense team lacks a team leader.” ”

“”Defense team?”Yu Zifei frowned slightly. “Miss Ye, I don’t want to go to the defense team. I want to go to Mars! I want to continue my previous work!” ”

The defense team was in charge of weapons. There wasn’t much space for exploration. It was no different from retirement.

“”But there’s danger on Mars. You’ve already been attacked once,”ye Zhuo said. ”

“”No, I’m not afraid!”Yu Zifei said. “Miss Ye, I’m willing to go to Mars. Don’t worry. If anything happens, my family will definitely not find trouble with you!” ”

“But...”Ye Zhuo was still a little hesitant.

“Yu Zifei continued, “Miss Ye, I know that there are dangers on Mars, but I’m not afraid. If everyone recoils from danger, then the OASIS project can be canceled! “Miss Ye, I want to advance and retreat together with you!” ”

“Hearing this, Ye Zhuo nodded slightly and said with a smile, “Team leader Yu, are you sure you’ve thought it through?” ”

“Yu Zifei nodded firmly. “Yes, I’m sure.” ”

“”Alright then,”ye Zhuo continued, “Then from the New Year onwards, you can continue to come back to work.” ”

“”Thank you, Miss Ye.”Yu Zifei was very excited. ”

Ye Zhuo had a smile on his face. “I should be the one thanking you.”

Thank God for arranging a group of people to trust her!

“Over here, Yu Zifei had just walked out of the door when she ran into her little assistant, Li Xiang. ”

“Team leader Yu.”Li Xiang was a little surprised to see Yu Zifei.

“Li Xiang.”Yu Zifei nodded.

“Li Xiang continued, “Team leader Yu, are you also here to look for Miss Ye?” ”

“Yes.”

“”I’m also here to look for Miss Ye,”Li Xiang said. “These days at home are really too boring! I think I’ll come back to work after the New Year!” ”

“Yu Zifei smiled and said, “Hurry up and go.” ”

“Then I’ll go in first.”

“With that, Yu Zifei seemed to have thought of something and continued, “Oh right, Li Xiang.” ”
