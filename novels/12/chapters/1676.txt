Translator: 549690339

“Zou feifei’s meaning was very obvious. If anything happened to Lin Sha Today, wouldn’t the top scorer this year change hands? ”

“Zou Feifei had scored 728 points in all three mock exams. Last year, the top scorer in Yunjing City’s college entrance examination had scored 729 points. ”

Her result was expected to be the top scorer this year. Her teachers and family were also full of expectations for her. Who knew that someone would suddenly appear out of nowhere.

“736 points, only 14 points away from the full score. This was a huge blow to Zou Feifei. ”

One had to know that Zou Feifei’s highest score in three mock exams had not exceeded 731 points!

“If nothing unexpected happened, Lin Sha’s 736 points would definitely be the top scorer of this year’s College Entrance Exam! ”

“Thinking of this, Zou Feifei’s heart was filled with a sense of threat. ”

“Ning Lan followed up, “Feifei, you’re also unlucky. If it wasn’t for Lin Sha, you would definitely be the top scorer in this year’s college entrance exam. Lin Sha just got appendicitis last year. She Can’t get appendicitis this year, right?” ”

“Zou feifei narrowed his eyes and continued, “Then do you think that other than appendicitis, there’s anything else that affects the college entrance exam?” ”

“Yes.”Ning Lan Thought for a moment. “A sudden high fever? Or a car accident?”

Zou Feifei didn’t reply. She looked up and saw the person she was waiting for walk out from the exit. She smiled and waved. “Auntie! This way!”

Zou Lin pulled her suitcase and walked over quickly. “Feifei.”

“Ning Lan greeted her. “Hello, Auntie.” ” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Zou Lin was stunned. “Feifei, this is?” ”

“Zou feifei introduced, “Aunt, this is my classmate, Ning Lan.” ”

“OH.”Zou Lin nodded and smiled. “The little girl is really beautiful!”

“Being praised for her beauty, ning LAN said happily, “Thank you, aunt.” ”

“”You’re welcome.”Ning LAN continued, “Feifei, let’s find a place to eat something first?” ”

“Sure.”Zou feifei nodded.

“Coincidentally, they passed by Lin Shasha and Ye Zhuo. ”

The two of them chatted and laughed as they walked out.

“Ning Lan caught a glimpse of a jade-like side profile and couldn’t help but exclaim, “Oh my God! The Girl Walking with Lin Shasha is so beautiful!” ”

“Apart from her beauty, Ning Lan also felt that this girl was somewhat familiar, but she couldn’t remember where she had seen her before. ”

“At this moment, Ning Lan seemed to have thought of something! Her eyes lit up! ”

YC!

It was YC.

The girl just now looked too much like Dr. YC.

“Some time ago, Dr. YC was famous all over the world. All the major news sections published Dr. YC’s deeds. Even Ning Lan, who did not pay much attention to scientific research, was very familiar with Dr. YC. ”

“Upon hearing this, Zou Feifei immediately looked up, but at this moment, she could only see the back of the girl. ”

“But from the back view, she was indeed a little different from an ordinary girl. ”

But what could a back view represent?

“Is it that good-looking? You’re making a fuss!”Zou Feifei said.

“”It’s good-looking!”Ning LAN continued, “I feel that she looks a little like Dr. YC.” ”

“Who are you talking about?”Zou Feifei asked.

“Dr. YC!”

“Hearing this, Zou Lin also looked back slightly. “Is it that girl just now?” ”

“Yes.”Ning Lan nodded.

“Ning LAN continued, “Could that girl just now be Dr. YC himself? I heard that Dr. YC isn’t that old either!” ”

“Zou feifei immediately laughed out loud. “Ning LAN, stop daydreaming! Would Dr. YC come to such a place?” ”

“”Who said he can’t come? Dr. YC’s household registration seems to be from Yunjing,”Ning Lan said. ”

“Zou feifei continued, “Even if Dr. YC really came to yunjing, it can’t be that girl! Dr. YC is the number one person on an aircraft carrier! She is also the mother of light. How many World Records has she broken? If she were to go out, she would have at least a dozen bodyguards with her! “Why would she keep such a low profile?” ”

Besides.

Who Was Lin Shasha?

“Her parents were very ordinary businessmen, and even their business was only recently established. Before that, her parents were very ordinary office workers, and their standard of living barely reached a well-off standard. ”

“Even now, the Lin family’s standard of living was only half of their family’s. ”

How could a family like the Lin family come into contact with Dr. YC?

It was simply a fantasy!

Dr. YC was a big shot that could go down in history. How could she know Lin Shasha and be so close to her!

“Hearing this, Ning Lan nodded. “You’re right. If Dr. YC really comes to Yunjing, the big leaders of Yunjing City will definitely come out to welcome him!” ”
