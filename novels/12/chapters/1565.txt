“”Actually, from what Miss Xiao Zhang said, it can be seen that she is a very kind-hearted girl. It’s a pity that she has met non-human beings!” ”

“”This reminds me of a saying. The poor can not win against the rich, and the people can not win against the officials.” ”

“What are you doing mosaic! You should show us what this crown prince of the Lin family looks like!”

“”I suggest Miss Xiao Zhang call the police. In this situation, it will take at least three years!” ”

“I support calling the police!”

“”Actually, to be honest, it is very normal for this kind of thing to happen in the circle of wealthy families like theirs. Through the Internet, we got to know a Miss Xiao Zhang, and after the internet, there are n more Miss Xiao Zhang!”! “It’s just that it hasn’t been exposed. I really hope that the country can come up with a law to severely punish these rich second generations!” ”

“[ Miss Xiao Zhang, please insist on protecting your rights. Don’t back down. We will always be by your side. ] ”

“[ this scumbag is called Lin Ze, right? I found out that he is also the campus belle of Beijing university official Weibo, may I ask if you still haven’t dealt with this kind of social cancer? ] ”

“[ scumbag, go to hell! ] ”

“[@beijing university official Weibo, why isn’t there any news from the official account? Don’t you usually take advantage of the Heat? ] ”

The impact of this matter was too great. There were even many netizens who went to the official Weibo of the LIN Corporation and Beijing University to curse.

The stock of the LIN Corporation was also affected because of this.

Tang Xue also saw the news.

Lin Ze.

“The netizens didn’t know, but she knew who Lin Ze was. ”

Lin Ze was ye Zao’s older brother.

“A while ago, Ye Zao had been very popular on a variety show. Although the program team had deleted the footage of her, her fans were still there, and her popularity was still there, and.., ye Zao had participated in the bidding as a chess host. Because of that show, ye Zao’s Weibo fans had already reached 90 million. ”

“If it was revealed that Ye Zao was Lin Ze’s brother at this time, the scene would definitely be very explosive. Tang Xue curled her lips slightly, picked up her phone, and sent a message. ”

“Twenty minutes later, Weibo added a new hot search. ”

# Sitara YC’s Ye #

# completely blew away that ye Zao and Lin Ze were biological siblings #

# Jing University’s Campus Belle #

[ oh my God! I didn’t Expect Ye Zao and Lin Ze to be biological siblings. How could our ye Zao have such a brother! ]

[ I’m really going to throw up! ]

[ the gap between the brother and sister is too big! ]

“[ if there is an elder brother, there will be a younger sister. Who knows what this younger sister will look like in the future! ] ”

[ news from the Du family! I heard that the Lin family was about to accept Miss Xiao Zhang. It was because of this sitara that the Lin family suddenly changed their mind! ]

“[ I told you, this Sitara is definitely not a good person! ] ”

A bunch of people chased after ye Zao’s Weibo and scolded him.

“Seeing that the incident was getting more and more heated, some of Ye Zao’s true fans couldn’t sit still anymore. [ Yezi, come out and clarify! We don’t believe that Big Brother is such a person! ] ”

“[ Yezi, we are all waiting for your reply! ] ”

“[ brain-dead fans are really too scary. At this time, they can still say such words. It’s simply disgusting! ] ”

“At this moment, Ye Zhuo forwarded Zhang Qingqing’s Weibo with a caption: [ hell is empty, the Devil is in the human world. ] ”

“After this Weibo post was posted, the netizens did not pay the bill, and the curses became even more serious. ”

[ who is the Devil? ]

“[ it’s really disgusting. At this time, they can still make such shameless remarks! ] ”

“[ well said, well said! I think your whole family should go to hell! ] ”

“[ indeed, the brother upstairs is right. The sister of a scum is also a scum. Now that you have legs and the truth, do you capitalists still want to cover up the truth? ] ”

[ I suggest that the government ban this big V! ] Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

[ can such a person become a streamer? He is simply influencing the next generation of the Motherland! ]

“Zhang Qingqing had been holding her phone the entire time. Seeing that ye Zao was also implicated, Zhang Qingqing was extremely happy. ”

“She had thought that ye Zao was very powerful, but it turned out that ye Zao only had so much ability. ”

What kind of hell was empty and the Devil was in the human world?

“Could it be that ye Zao did not know that at this time, the more pitiful he acted, the more sympathy he would receive? ”

“At this moment, father Zhang walked in from outside. “Qingqing, the heat of the matter is getting higher and higher. Why do you think the Lin family hasn’t sent anyone over yet?” ”

“It had been a few hours since the incident, and it had even implicated the Lin family’s daughter. Logically speaking, the Lin family was already in a state of panic, but the Lin family did not have any reaction at all. This made father Zhang very worried, he felt that there was something wrong with this matter, but he could not figure out what was wrong. ”
