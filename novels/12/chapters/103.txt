Chapter 104: 075: dinner, thousand miles of gratitude! 4

Maybe this was the bloodline suppression!

After saying that, Lin Sha asked curiously, “Aren’t you afraid of Mr. Cen at all?”

Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly. “What’s there to be afraid of? He doesn’t eat people!”

“I can’t describe that feeling either. Anyway, it’s Scary!”Lin Sha continued, “Go ahead, I’ll wait for you at the hotel.”

In fact, Lin Sha had some thoughts.

Cen Shaoqing was obviously not an ordinary person.

Ye Zhuo was not an ordinary person either.

Although Cen Shaoqing was a vegetarian and worshipped Buddha, Lin Sha felt that Cen Shaoqing treated ye Zhuo differently.

What if the two of them really got together in the future?

She did not want to stay and be a third wheel!

“Sister Sha Sha, we’re going to the most famous vegetarian restaurant in the capital tonight. Are you sure you don’t want to go?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“Yes, I’m sure!”Lin Shasha pushed ye Zhuo out. “Oh my! Don’t worry about me, you should go now!”

Ye Zhuo picked up the hat hanging on the clothes hanger and put it on his head. “Sister Shasha, I’ll go now.”

“Okay.”Lin Shasha nodded.

The restaurant was not far from the hotel. It would only take 20 minutes to walk there. Thinking of the traffic congestion in the capital, Ye Zhuo did not take a taxi and chose to walk there instead.

Although it was a sunny day, the snow on the road had not melted.

At four o’clock in the afternoon, when the sun was really setting, the sunlight reflected a golden light in the snow.

Ye Zao was wearing black tights, a white sweater, a knee-length beige woolen coat, and a hat. There was a layer of gauze in front of the hat, which made her jade-like face faintly visible.

The people passing by all paid attention to her.

Twenty minutes later, they arrived at the vegetarian restaurant.

When they arrived at the appointed seat, Cen Shaoqing had already arrived.

The man was sitting by the window. He was wearing a plain robe and holding a Buddhist pearl in his hand. He was looking out of the window indifferently.

The crystal light reflected on his well-defined facial features, making his already cold face even colder. It was as if his entire body was covered with a thin layer of ice.

The cold air was breathtaking.

The waiter who passed by did not dare to look directly at him.

“Mr. Cen, you’re here so early?”Ye Zhuo walked over.

Cen Shaoqing looked back slightly. “I’m only a minute or two earlier than you.” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Ye Zhuo took off the hat on his head and placed it on the empty seat beside him.

Cen Shaoqing reached out and poured a cup of tea for Ye Zhuo. He reminded him, “It’s a little hot.”

Ye Zhuo leaned over and sat down. He took a sip of the tea.

It was refreshing and sweet to the taste.

It was a good tea.

Ye Zao took another sip. “Mr. Cen, have you ordered yet?”

“Ladies first.”Cen Shaoqing handed the menu to ye Zao.

Ye Zao took the menu and was a little surprised.

With CEN Shaoqing’s current status in China, it was really not easy for him to uphold the etiquette of ladies first!

Because with his status, he did not need to curry favor with anyone.

In the capital, or even in the entire China, he was an existence that could cover the sky with one hand.

Perhaps, this was the cultivation of a person.

Ye Zhuo ordered a few of his favorite side dishes and handed the menu to Cen Shaoqing.

Cen Shaoqing added two more dishes.

The dishes were served very quickly. Ye Zhuo did not stand on ceremony with Cen Shaoqing. He picked up his chopsticks and started eating.

After shopping for a whole day, she was indeed a little hungry now.

She was the kind of person who did not pay much attention to the way she ate. She would do whatever was comfortable for her. However, if she did not pay attention, she would often appear to be the most beautiful and natural.

Cen Shaoqing tilted his head slightly.

The first thing that entered his eyes was that person eating with great concentration.

This dish?

Was It really that delicious?

Cen Shaoqing picked up a broccoli and chewed it slowly.

The taste didn’t seem to be anything special.

However, seeing that she was eating so well, Cen Shaoqing unconsciously ate a little more.

When they were almost done eating, Ye Zhuo called the waiter over. “Please give us two more servings of dessert after dinner.”

The waiter nodded. “Okay.”

Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips parted slightly. “Just the last serving will do. I’m already full.”

“It’s alright. Serve me two servings,”ye Zao said. “I can finish them all by myself.”

Cen Shaoqing:”...”

He suspected that ye Zao had never intended to order for him at all.

After the dessert was served, ye Zao began to focus on eating the dessert.

This was the first time Cen Shaoqing had met a girl who could eat so much.

He had four older sisters.

In order to maintain their figure, the older sisters only ate a little every time they ate, as if they were feeding a kitten. They did not even dare to touch the dessert.
