“Other than desserts, ye Zao loved spicy and sour potato chips the most. ”

Cen Shaoqing:”...”old Mrs. Cen sounded so reasonable that he was speechless.

“After a while, old Mrs. Cen turned around and walked into the kitchen. ”

“Cen Shaoqing looked at ye Zao and said with a bitter gaze, “I suspect that you are Grandma’s biological granddaughter.” ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Did you just realize that you picked it up?” ”

“After saying that, ye Zao continued, “How was the taste of the potato chips just now?” ”

“Do you want to try it?”Cen Shaoqing raised his eyebrows slightly.

“”Ah?”Ye Zao’s red lips opened slightly, and he was stunned. ”

Cen Shaoqing immediately leaned over and kissed her red lips.

“The taste of the exclusive spicy and sour potato chips, together with the faint scent of sandalwood and mint, penetrated into ye Zao’s mouth. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen walked out of the kitchen and stepped into the living room. Just as she was about to say something, she saw this scene and immediately raised her hand to cover her eyes. “Ah! It’s not suitable for children. It’s really not suitable for children!” ”

“As she said this, Old Mrs. Cen grabbed the ragdoll cat at the side and covered the ragdoll cat’s eyes. “You’re not allowed to look either. Come and cook with me.” ”

“Meow.”The ragdoll cat meowed in grievance. It just wanted to sleep.

“An hour later, Old Lady Cen finished making five dishes and a soup. ”

They were all ye Zao’s favorites.

“Ye Zao was a carnivore, so other than a plate of spicy and sour potato chips, there was no vegetable dish on the table. ”

“Of course, she did not prepare Cen Shaoqing’s favorite vegetable salad. ”

Cen Shaoqing silently put the Buddha beads back into his pocket.

Ye Zhuo looked at Cen Shaoqing. “Aren’t you going to eat grass today?”

Cen Shaoqing’s expression didn’t change. “It’s good to have a change of taste occasionally.”

“After saying that, Cen Shaoqing looked at Ye Zhuo. His deep gaze couldn’t even see the bottom. His tone was low as he said, “Besides, I like to eat meat.” ”

“It was clearly a very simple sentence, but ye Zhuo felt that something wasn’t quite right, especially Cen Shaoqing’s gaze. It was somewhat profound and also somewhat meaningful. ”

Was she thinking too much?

“Ye Zhuo picked up a piece of Dongpo meat. The fat but not greasy texture immediately made her forget all her worries. After eating a piece of Dongpo meat, Ye Zhuo turned to look at Old Mrs. Cen. “Grandma Cen, your cooking is simply superb!” ”

“Is it very delicious?”Old Mrs. Cen asked.

“It’s delicious! Very Delicious!”Ye Zhuo gave her a thumbs up.

Old Mrs. Cen picked up a piece of meat and put it into ye Zao’s Bowl. “Then try this piece of deer tendon.”

“Ye Zao lowered his head and ate the deer tendon. “It’s delicious! This deer tendon is also very delicious! Grandma Cen, you’re really amazing!” ”

Old Mrs. Cen was praised so much that she almost lost her mind. She wished that she could put all the dishes on the plate into ye Zao’s bowl.

“Then, she looked at Cen Shaoqing. She wanted to pick up a piece of potato chip, but it was snatched away by Old Mrs. Cen! ”

Pitiful.

Cen Shaoqing once again suspected that he was not his biological son.

The last piece of potato chip was picked up by Old Lady Cen and given to Ye Zhuo. Cen Shaoqing could only eat deer tendons and other meat.

“Seeing this, a satisfied light appeared in Old Lady Cen’s eyes. ”

“It was said in the book that if men often ate vegetarian food, it would affect their fertility. She was still waiting to have a great-grandchild! ”

“Although ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing were not married yet, they had to make more plans. It would be too late to adjust their diet after they got married! ”

On the other side.

“When Li Yueyue woke up, she found herself in an unfamiliar room. ”

Where was this?

Li Yueyue swallowed her throat.

She remembered that she went to drink with Ye Zao. Then what happened?

“Then, two men, one fat and one thin, came to pick a fight in the bar. ”

“She, she wouldn’t do it now... ”

“Thinking of this, Li Yueyue hurriedly lifted the blanket. When she saw that her clothes were well-dressed, Li Yueyue heaved a sigh of relief. ”

Fortunately!

“Fortunately, nothing happened. ”

“After resting for a while, Li Yueyue took out her phone and was about to call ye Zao to ask about ye Zao’s I status. However, she realized that ye Zao had sent her a lot of wechat messages. ”

“Seeing that it was Cen Shaoqing who asked his assistant to bring her to the hotel, Li Yueyue felt relieved and replied to Ye Zao’s wechat Message: [ Big Zao Zao, I’m already awake. Don’t worry about me. ] ”

“Ye Zao also replied instantly: [ Okay, call me if there’s anything. ] ”

“Li Yueyue: [ totally ojbk, I’m about to leave the hotel now. ] ” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“After replying to the text message, Li Yueyue turned around and walked out of the hotel room. ”

“Soon, she arrived at the lobby on the first floor. ”

“Li Yueyue went to check out. After checking out, Li Yueyue left the hotel. ”

“Just out of the hotel door, behind a pleasant male voice, “Ma’am, please wait.” ”
