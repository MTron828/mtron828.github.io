“It was so disgusting. Cen Yuyan had just made her move when she caught a bunch of sticky things, but she still didn’t want to give up. ”

Compared to the limited edition ZY.

What was the point of finding some trash?

The current Cen Yuyan wished she could slap her previous self to death.

“Back then, if she had opened it to take a look, she wouldn’t have gone to the extent of rummaging through the trash cans now. ”

“Cen Yuyan, this young miss of a rich family, had already put down her status and rummaged through the trash cans. Mother Liu also hurriedly came over to look for it together. ”

“Seeing the two of them like this, the uncle asked curiously, “Did you guys accidentally throw anything valuable into the trash cans?”The uncle had worked in the trash room for three years and had seen many careless people, he had accidentally thrown away valuable items as if they were trash and came back to look for them afterwards. ”

Some were lucky enough to find them.

Some were unlucky enough to never find them again.

“Mama Liu said while looking, “Yes! I just sent them over half an hour ago! A square cardboard box and a black bag of household trash. Do you remember them?” ”

“The uncle thought about it and said, “Did you throw them into that yellow trash can?” ”

“”Yes, yes, yes!”Seeing that the uncle remembered, mother Liu said excitedly, “May I ask where that pile of trash is now?” ”

Cen Yuyan raised her head in excitement.

The uncle’s expression was a little complicated. “Don’t look for it. That pile of trash seemed to have just been dragged away by the car.”

“”Dragged away? !”Cen Yuyan almost screamed out loud. She said with an excited expression, “Didn’t you say that it was here just now? Why is it being dragged away now?” ”

The uncle was shocked. He was afraid that Cen Yuyan would accuse him of taking something. “We have surveillance cameras here. Why don’t I adjust the surveillance cameras for you?”

Nanny Liu smiled apologetically. “Then I’ll have to trouble you.”

The uncle went into the house to adjust the surveillance cameras.

Cen Yuyan looked at Nanny Liu. “Continue to look here. I’ll go in and take a look.”

“Okay.”Nanny Liu nodded.

“The uncle quickly pulled up the surveillance camera. “This is your nanny, right?” ”

“Yes.”Cen Yuyan nodded.

“The uncle pointed at the surveillance camera and said, “Look, after she threw the rubbish into this rubbish bin, it was quickly taken away by the car.” ”

Cen Yuyan’s expression was very ugly. “Where is this car taking the rubbish to?”

“The uncle said, “It needs to be taken to the rubbish dump in the east of the city to be destroyed.” ”

Destroyed?

Cen Yuyan’s brows twitched.

“The uncle continued, “It’s already been more than half an hour. Perhaps the rubbish hasn’t been destroyed yet. I’ll help you make a call and ask.” ”

“Alright.”Cen Yuyan nodded.

The uncle made a call.

“Very soon, the call was connected. ”

The uncle specially put the phone on speaker.

“”Hello, Old Zhao, right? is the trash you just pulled from the Royal Garden still there?” ”

“That pile of trash has been destroyed! Why are you calling now?”

“The uncle continued, “I have a landlord here who lost a very important document. Are you sure it has been destroyed? Can you transfer it to the Destruction Records?” ”

“”Yes, I’m sure. If you want to transfer the records, you can come over at any time.” ”

The uncle hung up the phone and looked up at Cen Yuyan.

Cen Yuyan’s expression was unclear.

“She was really regretful, so regretful that even her intestines turned green. ”

Who would have thought that ye Zao would be so generous?

“If she had known that ye Zao had given her a limited edition ZY, she would not have thrown it away no matter what! ”

Cen Yuyan was a huge fan of ZY.

She had collected one of each ZY style.

“However, she had only collected two pieces of the limited edition, and they were the ones that had a limited edition of 10,000 pieces. ”

One could imagine how precious a limited edition of 10 pieces was.

“Seeing her like this, the uncle could vaguely guess that the things she had thrown away were definitely priceless. He couldn’t help but comfort her, “The old ones won’t go and the new ones won’t come. Money is just a worldly possession. Young Man, be more open-minded.” ”

Cen Yuyan didn’t know how she had walked out of the garbage room.

Her heart was filled with mixed feelings.

“At this moment, the sound of a video notification rang out again. ”

Cen Yuyan picked up the video.

“On the other end of the video was Cen Yueya’s excited face. “Fourth Lass, you’ve already unwrapped it, right? Quickly take out your clothes and let me take a look?” ”

Cen Yuyan’s expression was a little ugly. “I’m outside now.”

Only then did Cen Yueya see that the background behind Cen Yuyan was outside.

“Then go back and quickly unwrap it!”

“”En.”Cen Yuyan nodded and continued, “I’m a little uncomfortable now. Second sister, I Won’t talk to you anymore.” ”

Cen Yueya was about to say something else when Cen Yuyan hung up the video call.Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates
