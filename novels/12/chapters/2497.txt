“Xian ‘er continued, “I like you very much, very much.” ”

Yu Niannian laughed out loud.

He really thought that Xian ‘er was relying on herself.

So it turned out that she wanted to become an official!

“Xian ‘er did not look at Yu Niannian’s expression and continued, “You have always been the one in my heart. I fell in love with you at a glance five years ago. I knew that there was no turning back, but I was still stuck in it and could not extricate myself.” ”

Love?

“Xian ‘er, this canary, was talking about love in front of him? ” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

What a joke!

“And then?”Yu Mumu looked at Xian ‘er.

“Xian ‘er continued, “The past has passed. In the future, I will live on my own.” ”

“In the future, she would forget about Yu Mumu. ”

She would set off towards her goal.

“Yu Mumu smiled and said, “Then I wish you well in advance.” ”

“As he said that, Yu sunset raised his cup towards Xian ‘er. ”

Xian ‘er also picked up her goblet.

‘Bang!’

“Yu sunset only took a small sip, and Xian ‘er drank all the wine in the cup in one gulp. ”

Yu sunset saw through Xian ‘ER’s thoughts and did not say anything.

“She had said so much and done so much, but there was actually only one purpose. ”

“They were both adults, so it was good that everyone knew each other well. There was no need to bring it up on the table. ”

“After a candlelit dinner, Xian ‘er walked to Yu Mumu’s side. She extended her index finger and hooked it around Yu Mumu’s tie. Her eyes were like silk as she said, “Young Master Yu, let’s go.” ”

“Yu Mumu stood up very cooperatively and continued, “Is it the last night before we leave?” ”

“Yes.”Xian ‘er smiled slightly.

“After tonight, her and Yu Mumu’s lives would no longer have any interaction. ”

On the other side.

Ye Zao sat at a lively food stall and ordered a table full of delicious food.

“Another cold beer.”Ye Zao closed the menu.

“The ordering young man looked at the dishes ye Zao ordered and continued, “Beauty, are you alone?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“The young man continued, “Then you probably can’t finish so many dishes by yourself, right?” ”

The dishes that ye Zao ordered were at least enough for four people.

“”I can eat quite a lot,”ye Zao said with a smile. ”

The young man looked at Ye Zao.

“He was very good-looking, but he maintained his figure very well. ”

“He really didn’t look like he could eat. Moreover, ye Zao didn’t have any filming equipment, so he probably wasn’t faking it. ”

“”Okay.”The young man nodded and continued, “Then I’ll check the menu with you.” ”

“Okay.”

“After checking the menu, the young man went to the kitchen and handed the menu to the kitchen. “A super beautiful woman came to the front hall and ordered these dishes!” ”

“The chef in a white uniform asked curiously, “How Beautiful is she?” ”

“”Super Beautiful!”The young man continued, “She’s even more beautiful than a celebrity!” ”

The chef smiled and took the menu. “She’s indeed a beauty. Her taste in ordering dishes is so unique.”

Conclusion.

She was a beauty who knew how to eat.

“The chef continued, “Why don’t you take a photo of me and come over to take a look?” ”

The young man shook his head. “Do you know that you can look from afar but not touch?”

The Beauties in the front hall were exactly this type.

“Soon, the dishes ordered by ye Zao were served. ”

“Although there was only one person, ye Zao was still eating very happily. ”

The only way to solve his worries was to eat delicious food.

“Ye Zao.”

“At this moment, a surprised voice came from the air. ”

“Ye Zao raised his head slightly and saw a familiar face. He smiled and said, “Big Brother Song.” ”

“Song Shiyu subconsciously hid the cigarette in his hand and continued, “You’re just eating?” ”

“”Yes.”Ye Zao continued, “Big Brother song, Sit Down and eat together?” ”

Song Shiyu sat across from her. “Then I’ll respectfully accept your request.”

Ye Zhuo called the waiter over and added a pair of chopsticks and bowls.

“After song Shiyu sat down, he naturally threw doctor Liu’s words to the back of his mind. ”

Ye Zhuo added a few more side dishes.

“The two of them chatted as they ate, and it was quite enjoyable. ”

“After they had their fill, they returned to their respective homes. ”

“In front of her, song Shiyu maintained a faint smile. No one felt that there was anything unusual about him. ”

“After returning home, Song Shiyu lay in front of the washing table and puked his guts out. ”

His persistence for the past few days was completely overturned tonight.

“The assistant was scared out of his wits. Song Shiyu had been following the doctor’s orders these past few days, and his condition had been exceptionally good. Why was he puking like this? ”

“A few minutes later, song Shiyu turned to look at the assistant and said with a pale face, “Contact Dr. Liu.” ”

“”Okay, I’ll contact him right away.”The assistant immediately went to contact Dr. Liu. ”

“After Dr. Liu received the call from his assistant, he immediately drove over. ”

“Half an hour later, Dr. Liu arrived at Baiyun Residence. ”
