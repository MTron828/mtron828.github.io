“”Young?”The second clan leader frowned and continued, “Wasn’t miss ye young back then?” ”

How Old Was Ye Zhuo back then?

Eighteen years old.

“The second clan leader was the same as the other clan leaders. He was very loyal to Ye Zhuo. He felt that since ye Zhuo had entrusted everyone to the autumn flute, then the autumn flute must have its own outstanding qualities, qiu Di would definitely be able to lead Chang Yue to an even more glorious future. ”

“No matter what, they could not go against ye Zhuo’s words. ”

“But not everyone is Miss Ye.”The third clan leader said.

“People like ye Zhuo were, after all, a minority. ”

“Hearing this, the second clan leader narrowed his eyes and continued, “But this is after all Miss Ye’s intention.” ”

“”Second clan leader, don’t forget, this is just Qiu Di’s one-sided statement.”The third clan leader continued, “We sent the information of the trans-star case over for so long, but Qiu di still couldn’t open it. This means that she doesn’t have that ability!” ”

How could a person who didn’t even have the ability to open the information of the trans-star case sit on the position of female sovereign?

“Moreover, Ye Zhuo didn’t leave any evidence to prove that he gave the position of crown prince to Qiu Di! ”

“The second clan leader continued, “I feel that Qiu di doesn’t have the guts to lie. Moreover, we have also investigated the matter back then, and what Qiu di said is true!” ”

“Speaking of this matter, none of them said a word. ”

“After all, Ye Zhuo did indeed have that experience back then. If she had given the position of successor to Qiu Di to repay her kindness, it wasn’t impossible. ”

“Speaking up to this point, the second clan leader paused, then he said, “And Ye Han, if it wasn’t for Miss Ye personally doing it, who do you think would have the ability to change ye Han’s memories? Not to mention Qiu di, even if the eight of US worked together, we wouldn’t have such an ability.” ”

“From this, it could be seen that what Qiu di said was true. ”

“Hearing this, there was a moment of silence in the air. ”

What the second clan leader said made sense.

“After a moment, the third clan leader raised his head to look at the first clan leader, “First clan leader, in your opinion, how should we deal with this matter?” ”

“The first clan leader stroked his beard and continued, “Let’s Wait a little longer, the position of female sovereign is not a child’s play. Moreover, the insect race is still eyeing us covetously.” ”

“As early as three years ago, the Bug clan had wanted to attack the Chang Yue country. ”

Because the Chang Yue country was in the best geographical position for energy sources.

“If they could take down the Chang Yue country, they would be able to obtain the best resources in the S Galaxy. ”

“Three years ago, the leader of the Bug clan had met ye Zhuo during the battle. ”

“Ye Zhuo had single-handedly swept away 3,000 elite bug clan soldiers, leaving behind a legend in the Bug clan. ”

The Zerg were willing to submit to the Chang Yue country.

“Hence, the Chang Yue country did not dare to announce ye Zao’s obituary to the public. ”

They were afraid that the Zerg would have bad intentions again.

“Now That Ye Zao was not around, if the Zerg started a war again, unless the main alliance country intervened, otherwise, the Chang Yue country’s bloodline would disappear forever in the s galaxy. ”

“Hearing this, the second clan leader nodded, ”

“the first clan leader continued, “Oh right, third and fifth, I asked you to gather information about Yi Ling. How’s Your Investigation Going?” ”

“”There’s still no news at the moment,”said the third clan leader. ”

“The fifth clan leader continued, “Yi Ling only recognizes one master in its entire life, and it has a telepathic connection with Miss Ye. Could it have noticed Miss Ye’s matter, so...”the rest of the matter was already self-evident. ”

“”It won’t. Yi Ling will definitely not seek death so easily!”The eighth clan leader, who had been silent all this while, said. ”

“At least, before ye Zhuo’s obituary came out, Yi Ling would not seek death. ”

The first clan leader nodded slightly. “Then continue searching.”

At the same time.

On the other side.

Mars.

Ye Zhuo stood in front of a miniature machine.

“Do you know what this is?”She turned to look at Cen Shaoqing beside her.

“Cen Shaoqing opened his thin lips and said in a low voice, “The interstellar shuttle.” ”

“Previously, Ye Zao had always thought that she had come from the future, so she had studied the space-time shuttle for more than a year. ” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“In fact, the space-time shuttle was of no help to her at all. ”

The machine she needed the most now was the interstellar shuttle.

“Hearing this, Ye Zao’s eyes lit up slightly, and he said with a smile, “That’s right, this is the interstellar shuttle. I want to use this to return to changyue. But now, I still lack one thing.” ”

“Perpetual motion machine?”Cen Shaoqing saw the crux of the problem at a glance.

Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“Cen Shaoqing walked over and studied the main structure of the shuttle. He then said, “Maybe you can try the Suyu.” ”

“Suyu?”Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly.
