Translator: 549690339

“Okay.”

“After hanging up the phone, Father Zhao opened his mailbox. ”

“There was only one unread document in the mailbox. When he opened it, it was from Mike. ”

“Father Zhao put his palms together. “Buddha bless, Buddha bless, it must not be a Ye! It must not be a Ye!” ”

He had been looking for his son for more than thirty years.

“If Ye Sen was Zhao Ziye, what would he do? ”

“Therefore, Ye Sen must not be Zhao Ziye! ”

It must not be!

“After saying that, Father Zhao took a deep breath and began to read the contents of the document. ”

“The more he read, the uglier father Zhao’s expression became. In the end, a layer of cold sweat appeared on Father Zhao’s forehead. ”

“According to the information, Ye Sen’s biological mother was not Zhang Cuiping, but Zhang Cuiping’s cousin, Ye Yuyi. ”

Who Was Ye Yuyi?

She was the fiancée of Father Zhao’s childhood sweetheart.

“That year, Father Zhao and ye Yuyi gave birth to Zhao Ziye out of wedlock. Later, because of a series of events, Father Zhao was forced to separate from ye Yuyi and gave birth to Zhao Xueyin with Zhao Xueyin’s birth mother. ”

“After Zhao Xueyin’s birth mother died, when Father Zhao went to look for ye Yuyi again, it was as if ye Yuyi had disappeared from the face of the Earth. ”

He couldn’t get any news.

Father Zhao didn’t expect ye Yuyi to entrust Zhao Ziye to Zhang Cuiping.

He also didn’t expect ye Yuyi to have other relatives in this world.

“If Ye Sen’s birth mother was ye Yuyi, then wasn’t Ye Sen Zhao Ziye? ”

Ye Sen was the son that he had painstakingly searched for more than 30 years.

How could this be…

How could this be…

How could this be!

What stupid things had he done.

He had actually let someone hurt his own son!

That was his son.

“All these years, he had been deeply in love with his son. ”

He had suffered a lot.

Father Zhao had never dreamed that Yesen was his son.

It was also at this time that Father Zhao realized why he had a strange sense of familiarity when he first saw Yesen.

So he was his son…

Half of his life.

A whole half of his life.

It was not easy for him to find his son. Why would the heavens play such a joke on him?

“Father Zhao grabbed his hair and fell into extreme pain. His face was full of tears. “Yuyi, Yuyi, I’ve let you down! I’ve let our son down even more!” ”

“What should we do? What should we do? Can someone tell me what to do? !”

“As he cried, Father Zhao seemed to have remembered something. He picked up his phone and called Mike. ”

The call went through very quickly.

“Mr. Zhao.”Mike’s voice came from the other side.

“Father Zhao cried and said, “Mike, Mike, how is Yesen Now?” ”

“Mike was stunned at first, then he said, “Mr. Zhao, don’t worry. Although ye Sen is fine now, he definitely won’t live for more than three days!” ”

Mike was an assassin and also a poison expert.

“Those who had been through his hands, even if Hua Tuo was still alive, would not be able to save them. ”

Three days!

His son could only live for three days?

“Father Zhao’s face turned pale, as if he had just died. ”

No!VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

No!

“Father Zhao said emotionally, “Mike, do you have the antidote? Don’t Die! Ye Sen can’t Die! He can’t Die! Give me the antidote!” ”

The only person who could save ye Sen now was Mike.

“Mike could tell that something was wrong with Father Zhao’s voice and continued, “Mr. Zhao, did something happen?” ”

“Father Zhao continued, “Son! Ye Sen is my son! My biological son, so he can’t Die!” ”

“Even if he died, Yesen couldn’t die. ”

“”I’m sorry, Mr. Zhao.”Mike’s voice came from the screen again. “There’s no antidote for this poison.” ”

There’s no antidote?

How could there be no antidote?

“Father Zhao continued, “Didn’t you make this poison yourself? Why is there no antidote?” ”

What was regret?

“In the past, Father Zhao never knew what regret was. ”

“Now, he finally felt it. ”

The feeling of regret was too unbearable.

“If he had known earlier, he definitely wouldn’t have let Mike lay his hands on Yesen! ”

What should he do?

What should he do now?

What should he do now?

Father Zhao closed his eyes in pain.

“”Mr. Zhao, I can understand your current feelings, but I’m sorry, there really is no antidote for this medicine.” ”

“Hearing Mike’s voice, Father Zhao was almost in despair. ”

“”Mike, Mike, I’m begging you, can you give me the antidote? As long as you give me the antidote, I can give you as much money as you want!” ”

“Mike continued, “Mr. Zhao, this is not a matter of money…” ”

“Six Million!”Father Zhao directly interrupted Mike’s words.
