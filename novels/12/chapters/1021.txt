“Chapter 1022: 229: Aunt Lang finally knows the truth of that year, tears in her eyes! 3”

Translator: 549690339

“Ye Shu also reacted at this time. “Ah Ze and burning are right. Ye Sen, no matter what happens, you are my brother, the children’s uncle, and a part of this family!” ”

Her brother-sister relationship with Ye Sen was not fake.

“When she was fourteen years old, she returned to ye Dahai and Zhang Cuihua’s side. At that time, Ye Sen was only in his teens. Ye Dahai and his wife did not like ye Sen. Ye Sen and ye Shu hugged each other for warmth, even though they were only fifteen years apart, however, Ye Sen was practically raised by ye Shu. ”

“Sister...”Ye Sen’s nose twitched.

“If it was not for ye Shu, his sister, Ye Sen would not have gotten to where he was today. ”

“”Alright, stop crying.”Ye Shu took a tissue to help ye Sen wipe his tears. “You’re not allowed to say thank you either. We’re family. It’s too distant to say thank you!” ”

“Ye Sen’s tears turned into a smile. “Sister, you really know me! You even know what I’m thinking in My Heart!” ”

“Ye Shu patted ye Sen. “Of course. Otherwise, how could I be your sister? How could I not know what you’re Thinking?” ”

“Ye Sen looked at Ye Zao, then he said, “Zao Zao, what’s Up With that Aunt Lang? Why did she throw your mother away back then? Since she already threw her away, what does it mean to want to take your mother back now?”Ye Sen was not from Beijing, he did not know the story of Aunt Lang. In that era, there were many families that valued sons over daughters. Ye Shu was also a girl, so he subconsciously felt that Aunt Lang had thrown away ye Shu because she valued sons over daughters. ”

“Old Lady Lin had the most say in this matter. After all, she was the witness of this matter. ”

She had personally witnessed how ye Langhua had turned from a talented girl in the capital to the current state.

“”Uncle, don’t be anxious. Let me tell you,”old Mrs. Lin said slowly, “The Aunt Lang that burning spoke of was called ye Langhua. More than thirty years ago, Ye Langhua was a talented woman who was well-known throughout the capital. Not only was she talented, but she was also extremely beautiful, causing many scholars to dream about her. “Unfortunately, she didn’t have good taste. She didn’t meet a good person. In today’s terms, it’s like Miss Meeting a Phoenix Man.” ”

“The Phoenix Man’s name is Xi Muwen. Xi Muwen was born...”

“Old Madam Lin spoke slowly, and her thoughts seemed to return to thirty years ago in an instant. ”

“”Later, after ye Langhua’s only daughter disappeared for half a month, ye Langhua’s hair turned white overnight, and her mind became a little unclear. Later on, elder ye fell ill because of this incident, and he passed away in less than two months. Ye Langhua was already exhausted from the loss of half a month, and after elder Ye’s accident, he completely defeated ye Langhua... “... “...” ”

“Ye Sen frowned as he listened to the whole story. He sighed deeply and said, “There must be something hateful about a poor person. If I Were Ye Langhua, I definitely wouldn’t let the Phoenix man take away my family’s property!” ”

“”Uncle! “You’re thinking the same thing as me!”Old Mrs. Lin continued, “Even though I didn’t do well in the past, I definitely wouldn’t be as useless as ye Langhua!”! “Xi Muwen, that ungrateful wretch, ate the ye family’s money and used the Ye family’s money. If it wasn’t for ye Langhua, would he be able to live a good life today? “But he didn’t know how to be grateful. Instead, he used the Ye family’s money to raise a mistress and an illegitimate daughter!” ”

“In Old Mrs. Lin’s view, Yang Jiao was a mistress and XI Weiyue was an illegitimate daughter. ”

“Xi Muwen had taken everything from the Ye family, but ye Langhua had turned a blind eye and was immersed in his own world, unable to extricate himself. ” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

What kind of big deal could this be?

No wonder she had been deceived!

“Lin Jincheng frowned and continued, “But I heard that the Xi family has already found half a month? If Ah Shu is half a month, then who is the one in the Xi Family?” ”

“”Aunt Lang has been deceived,”ye Zhuo continued, “This is all XI Muwen’s scheme.” ”

Old Madam Lin looked up at Ye Zhuo. “Could it be because of the Shunxi Financial Group?”

Ye Zhuo was stunned. “You know about the Shunxi Financial Group?”

“Old Madam Lin nodded. “So, it really is because of the Shunxi Financial Group?” ”

“”Yes,”ye Zhuo continued, “Xi Muwen wants Xi Weiyue to join the Shunxi Financial Group. Aunt Lang has already written a recommendation letter to let Xi Weiyue become grandfather Ye’s heir.” ”

“What?”Old Madam Lin was stunned. “Make that illegitimate daughter the heir of Old Master Ye? Is Ye Langhua crazy? Doesn’t she know that half a month is fake?”
