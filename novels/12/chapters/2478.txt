“On the other side, Chen Siyao looked at her assistant. “Are you sure Grandpa sent the news to Shiyu?” ”

“I’m sure.”The assistant nodded.

“Since she was sure, why hadn’t song Shiyu made a move until now? ”

“Logically speaking, song Shiyu shouldn’t have just watched her starve to death. ”

“She grew up with song Shiyu. Even if song Shiyu really didn’t want to marry her, he should have come to see her at a time like this. ”

How could he be so cruel.

What should she do now?

She knew very well about Chen Siyao’s own body. She couldn’t hold on for much longer.

“If song Shiyu still didn’t come, she would die. ”

“With that in mind, Chen Siyao bit her lip. Her eyes were filled with unwillingness. “Bring me my phone.” ”

“”Okay.”Her assistant walked over, picked up Chen Siyao’s phone, and handed it to her. ”

Chen Siyao took the phone and made a call.

“A moment later, Chen Siyao looked at the assistant. “Give me your phone.” ”

Her number had already been blocked by song Shiyu.

The assistant handed her phone to Chen Siyao.

Chen Siyao pressed the familiar number and dialed it.

“Very soon, the call connected. ”

“However, it was the assistant who answered the call. ”

This wasn’t song Shiyu’s personal call.

“When Chen Siyao heard the voice on the other end of the line, her heart turned cold. ”

“So after knowing him for so many years, she didn’t even deserve his personal number. ”

How laughable.

How laughable!

“On the other end of the line, Chen Siyao laughed out loud. ”

“The assistant listened to the laughter on the other end of the line with a puzzled look and tried his best to be polite. “Hello, May I help you?” ”

The assistant’s voice pulled Chen Siyao’s thoughts back to reality. “I’m Chen Siyao.”

Chen Siyao.

“Hearing the voice on the other end, the assistant was stunned. ”

“”I’m looking for Shiyu,”Chen Siyao continued. ”

“Although song Shiyu’s intentions were very obvious, Chen Siyao still harbored some fantasies. ”

“She and song Shiyu were childhood sweethearts. They were young and innocent. Even if song Shiyu didn’t like her, he still had other feelings for her. ”

“The assistant continued, “Miss Chen, our boss said that he doesn’t want to see you.” ”

“I’m going to die.”Chen Siyao’s voice sounded weak and sad. “He doesn’t even want to see me one last time?”

Song Shiyu was the person that she had loved all of her youth.

“From ignorance to the beginning of love, until now... ” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

She had never changed.

“Hearing this, the assistant’s mood didn’t change much. She just said, “Miss Chen, please wait a moment.” ”

“Okay.”

The sound of soft footsteps came from the other end of the phone.

“”Boss.”Then came the assistant’s voice, followed by a low whisper. ”

“Although Chen Siyao couldn’t hear what the assistant said to Song Shiyu, she could guess it. ”

“A moment later, song Shiyu’s voice came through the receiver. ”

“It was cold, ruthless, and cruel. ”

“With just one sentence, Chen Siyao was sent to hell. ”

He said.

“It’s still clean even if you’re dead.”

“Chen Siyao’s already pale face instantly turned pale, and the light in her eyes disappeared. ”

It’s still clean even if you’re dead.

It’s still clean even if you’re dead.

A mocking smile tugged at the corner of Chen Siyao’s mouth as her phone fell weakly from her hand.

PA —

It fell to the ground.

“Du du du –”

There was a busy sound coming from the other end. It must have hung up.

Chen Siyao didn’t even have the strength to cry anymore. Her heart was filled with sorrow.

“”Miss, I’ll get the driver to send you to the hospital!”The assistant jumped in fright and immediately helped Chen Siyao up. ”

Chen Siyao pushed the assistant’s hand away. “I’m not going to the hospital!”

“Right now, she just wanted to see if song Shiyu really wanted her to die. ”
