Worker Xu and the others were a little dumbfounded.

So he really came to apologize.

“After a while.., professor cara continued, “Worker Xu, I’ve already taken care of the handover of the base. You just need to sign here. Of course, if you don’t trust me, you can also bring your lawyer to the base tomorrow to handle it on the spot.””

“Worker Xu was a very cautious person. He was afraid that Cara was digging a hole for him, so he continued, “It’s too late now. Why Don’t we do it tomorrow?””

“Sure.”Dr. Cara nodded. “Then tell me the time. I’ll arrange for the driver to pick everyone up tomorrow.”

“Then let’s go up at 8:30 tomorrow?”

“Okay.”

“Until Dr. Cara and the others left the hotel conference room, worker Xu and the others still couldn’t react.”

Cara’s reaction before and after was like a completely different person!

“If they did not see it with their own eyes, who would believe that it was real?”

“Yang Hua walked to Xu Gong’s side and said in disbelief, “Xu Gong, what do you think is going on? Cara really came over to apologize to us! What do you think he’s up to?””

“I’ll call Miss Ye and ask!”Xu Gong said.

Yang Hua nodded.

“Ten minutes later, worker Xu came to the conference room, he smiled and said, “Everyone, don’t worry. I’ve already asked Miss Ye! Miss ye said that there’s no problem. Kara doesn’t dare to play any tricks. We’ll just go over tomorrow and go through the handover procedures.””

“Miss Ye is too amazing!”Yang Hua sighed.

“Someone at the side smiled and said, “If Miss Ye isn’t amazing, can she create an aircraft carrier?””

“That’s true!”

“The next day, worker Xu led everyone to successfully complete the handover of the base.”

“After settling everything, worker Xu led everyone to fly the flag of China in the plaza of the C Nation Base.”

“The bright red flag fluttered in the air above the foreign territory, allowing the Wanderers who were drifting outside to see a sense of belonging and a sense of pride!”

On the other side.

The Tang family.

“After being chased out of the Cen family base, Tang Xue felt extremely uncomfortable. She couldn’t accept this reality and slept at home for a day and a night.”

Tang Xue’s mother was very anxious.

“Tang Xue was her only daughter. Now that Tang Xue had become like this, what should she do?”

“Tang Xue’s mother made a lot of calls, most of them to old master Tang’s old subordinates.”

She hoped that everyone could help Tang Xue out on account of Old Master Tang.

Unfortunately.

Tang Xue’s problem this time was too serious. A few people who had received old master Tang’s favor did not dare to make a sound in front of Cen Shaoqiang.

“”Old Sun, you watched Xiaoxue grow up. You should know very well what kind of child she is.”Tang’s mother’s voice was about to cry, “Moreover, even if Xiaoxue really made a mistake this time, so what? “No one is perfect. Everyone makes mistakes sometimes. Master five can’t treat Xiaoxue like this just because of this mistake! “Xiaoxue is the only heir of the old master! “Elder Sun, can you please help Xiaoxue out of respect for the old master? “As long as you seniors work together, you will definitely be able to make master five show Mercy!””

Elder sun was displeased when he heard this. What did Tang mean?

He wanted him to join hands with the other seniors to threaten Cen Shaoqing?

“If it was in the past, elder Sun might have considered Tang’s words.”

Now.

“With professor Yue as an example, even if he had the heart, he wouldn’t have the guts!”

“Tang wasn’t asking him to speak up for Tang Xue, but to push him into the fire pit.”

“Elder sun continued, “Mrs. Tang, you really think too highly of me. I’m afraid I Won’t be able to help you with this matter!””

“Hearing this, mother Tang was furious.”

What did elder Sun Mean?

“If it wasn’t for elder Tang, would he be where he is today?”

“He, on the other hand, threw elder Tang to the back of his mind in the blink of an eye.”

He was simply unscrupulous!

“Mother Tang tried her best to control her anger, then she said, “Elder Sun, you and the other uncles are all elders of the base. As long as you appear, fifth master will definitely consider it carefully. I don’t have any other way. Elder Sun, the only ones who can help Xiaoxue now are you guys!””

“”Mrs. Tang, have you forgotten professor Yue’s example?”Elder Sun asked in return.”

Tang froze.

Of course she knew about Professor Yu!

“Because he had threatened Cen Shaoqing, Cen Shaoqing had directly expelled him from the base. He didn’t show any mercy at all.”

“However, elder Sun’s situation was different from Professor Yue’s.”

“Tang Xue was, after all, the descendant of Old Master Tang!”

And Old Master Tang had done them a favor.
