Chapter 159: 085: “Lovely Old Lady Cen, my granddaughter-in-law is the most beautiful woman in the world!”! 3

“Yes.”An Lizi nodded. “I had a nightmare the whole night.”

Ye Zao took out a small black bottle from his backpack and handed it to an Lizi. “This medicine is to help you sleep. It’s all natural and has no side effects. Lizi, you can try it.”

“Thank you, Zao Zao Zao.”An Lizi took the small bottle with both hands.

Ye Zao smiled faintly. “You’re welcome.” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

An Lizi was not in a good mood the entire day. When she was queuing up at the cafeteria in the afternoon, she was even more absent-minded. She frowned at times and sighed at other times.

Zhao Pingting and ye Zao looked at each other and reached out to poke ye Zao. “Zao Zao, look at Lizi. What’s wrong with her?”

Ye Zao shook his head and tilted his head to look at an Lizi. He patted her shoulder. “Lizi, are you feeling unwell?”

“I’m fine, Zao Zao, you don’t have to worry.”An Lizi shook her head and reached out to take the plate that the canteen auntie handed over.

However, due to a moment of carelessness, the plate slipped from her hand.

It looked like it was about to fall to the ground.

Ye Zao stretched out his hand and caught it just like that. It was about to fall off the plate.

It was very stable.

Not even a drop of soup spilled.

......

Zhao Pingting stood at the side, her eyes almost sparkling. “Zhuo Zhuo, you’re so powerful!”

Although she knew that ye Zhuo was very powerful.

But every time ye Zhuo made a move, it was always stunning!

“Otherwise, how could it be your father Zhuo!”After saying that, Ye Zhuo returned the plate to an Lizi. “Lizi, you must tell us if there’s anything.”

“Okay.”An Lizi nodded.

An Lizi didn’t know how to explain this matter.

After all, that person was her father.

Now, she could only hide it, hide it, and digest it by herself.

An Lizi had been using the words of the relationship expert to comfort herself.

Being kept in the dark was also a kind of happiness.

Since her mother was very happy now, why did she have to destroy this happiness?

Zhao pingting continued, “Lizi, did you break up with someone?”

An Lizi looked up at Zhao Pingting. “It’s just a small family matter. It’s not big or small. In short, it’s quite annoying.”

Zhao Pingting held an Lizi’s hand. “Lizi, you’re still young. You’re already worried about family matters. Let adults worry about adults.”

The three of them sat at the dining table and ate.

An Lizi looked at Zhao Pingting and hesitated for a moment before saying, “Pingting, how are your parents’Feelings?”

“Pretty Good!”Zhao pingting nodded. “My dad is very introverted and doesn’t know how to socialize. Usually, my mom is in charge of the family. Although we usually quarrel, it’s always my mom scolding my dad. My dad just listens.”

An Lizi suddenly felt a little envious of Zhao Pingting.

Why were other people’s dads all good dads.

Was her dad going to look for a mistress?

After saying this, Zhao Pingting was a little puzzled. “Lizi, why are you asking about this?”

“I’m just curious.”An Lizi smiled.

Zhao Pingting smelled something abnormal. “Lizi, did your dad and Your Mom Fight?”

“I don’t know how to say it either.”An Lizi scratched her head. “It’s not really a fight, right...”

After all, this was just an Lizi’s family affair, so Zhao Pingting didn’t ask any more questions.

After thinking for a while, an lizi continued, “Zha Zha, Pingting, I want to ask you a question.”

“You ask.”

“If,”an Lizi carefully chose her words in her mind. “I mean if, if you find out that your neighbor’s sister’s father is having an affair, what will you do?”

It was not good to expose the scandal, so an Lizi had no choice but to change her identity to that of the neighbor’s sister.

Zhao Pingting was stunned. She looked at an Lizi with a blank expression. It was obvious that she had never encountered such a problem before.

Ye Zhuo thought about it seriously. “Does your neighbor’s sister know about this?”

An Lizi nodded.

Ye Zhuo frowned slightly and continued, “She didn’t tell her mother about this?”

An Lizi shook her head and voiced out her concerns, “Her mother is a very, very good person. She loves and loves her father very much. If her mother finds out about this, based on her mother’s character, it’s very likely that she will jump off a building. That’s why my neighbor’s sister has never dared to tell her mother.”

Ye Zhuo glanced at an Lizi, “If she doesn’t tell her mother, this is a very unfair thing for her mother! “I suggest you tell your neighbor’s sister and let her tell her mother the truth. I believe that as an adult, she will solve this problem perfectly.”

Ye Zhuo had never been in a relationship or married in his previous life.
