“Let’s go back first. Where do you live?”Xu Yao asked.

He ziteng was so drunk that he didn’t even remember where he lived.

“Xu Yao took out her phone from his pocket and unlocked it with her fingerprint. Then, she opened the receiving address on his shopping app and chose a common address. ”

“After doing all this, Xu Yao took he ziteng out of the rice noodle shop and hailed a taxi. ”

“The taxi was very fast. After about 15 minutes, they arrived at he ziteng’s apartment. ”

The apartment was not big.

The defense system was very good. It was all facial recognition. Xu Yao supported he ziteng and walked straight into the house.

“He ziteng’s face was red. He hugged Xu Yao tightly. “Yaoyao, I really like you. I want to be with you...” ”

“Xu Yao narrowed her eyes and continued, “Ziteng, you drank too much. Have a seat first. I’ll go get you some yogurt.” ”

“”Not much. I didn’t drink too much at all.”He ziteng hugged Xu Yao and was unwilling to let go. “Yaoyao, am I Dreaming?” ”

He ziteng felt that he was dreaming.

Because only in a dream could he hug Xu Yao so realistically.

“Although Xu Yao did not have any real relationships with her past boyfriends, it was just that she did not reach the final step. She had done everything else that she needed to do! ”

She knew the secrets of men.

“A seemingly simple action could make one unable to stop, just like he ziteng now. ”

“A man who was drunk was in high spirits, especially when he was facing the person he liked. ”

“Xu Yao supported he ziteng. “Ziteng, let me take you to wash your face first, then go back to your room to rest, okay?” ”

“After saying that, Xu Yao let he ziteng sit on the sofa to rest, while she went to find the bathroom. ”

“Ten minutes later, Xu Yao helped he ziteng wash his face, then brought he ziteng to the bedroom to rest. ”

“He ziteng was still in a daze, and Xu Yao used a lot of effort to bring him to the bedroom. ”

Xu Yao looked around without leaving a trace.

There were no cameras.

Xu Yao placed he ziteng on the bed and started to undress him.

“Soon, he ziteng’s coat was taken off. ”

“In his daze, he ziteng seemed to see Xu Yao standing in front of him. He smiled and said, “Ziteng, I like you. I’m willing to be your girlfriend. Let’s be together.” ”

“Looking at the face that was gradually magnified in front of him, he ziteng suddenly felt his throat become dry. He licked his lips and finally reached out to grab her hand and kissed it fiercely. ” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Dream.

It must be a dream.

“If it wasn’t a dream, how could he kiss Xu Yao so easily. ”

“Thinking that he was really dreaming, he ziteng became even more unscrupulous. ”

Rip.

Following that was the sound of clothes being torn.

“Looking at the man on top of her, Xu Yao curled the corners of her lips, her eyes filled with pride. ”

She had won this game.

...

“When he ziteng woke up again, it was already the next morning. ”

“He ziteng pinched his temples, feeling a little headache. ”

Last Night’s events were like a movie playing in front of his eyes.

Was It a dream?

He ziteng turned to look at the other side of the bed.

It was empty. Xu Yao was not there.

Xu Yao was not there.

It must be a dream!

“At that moment, he ziteng lifted the quilt. ”

He saw a bright red mark on the Bright Red Quilt.

It was blood.

Why was there blood on the bed!

What was going on?

Could it be...

Everything that happened last night was real?

Oh My God!

What did he do?

He actually forced Xu Yao.

He ziteng scratched his head?

What should he do now?

Would Xu Yao still forgive him?

“Also, where was Xu Yao Now? ”

“He Ziteng got out of bed and casually put on a pair of pajamas from the closet. Then, he went to the living room to look for someone. “Yaoyao! Xu Yao!” ”

No one answered in the apartment.

He ziteng picked up his phone again and called Xu Yao.

“It rang for a long time. Just when he ziteng thought Xu Yao wouldn’t answer, the phone was picked up. “Hello.” ”

“”Yaoyao!”Hearing Xu Yao’s voice, he ziteng was very excited. “Yaoyao, I’m sorry. Are You... Are You Okay Now?” ”

“”I’m fine.”Xu Yao’s voice sounded a little tired. “Ziteng, I know you didn’t do it on purpose last night. Let bygones be bygones.” ”

“Although Xu Yao said she was fine, he ziteng was still worried. “Yaoyao, are you really fine?” ”

“”I’m really fine.”Xu Yao continued, “You don’t have to worry about me.” ”
