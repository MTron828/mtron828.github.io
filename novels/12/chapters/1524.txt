Translator: 549690339

Tang Xue couldn’t be happier that such a thing had happened.

“After all, Ye Zao’s actions were undoubtedly courting death! ”

“The more ye Zao was courting death, the more advantageous the situation would be for her! ”

“She originally thought that after Professor Yue left, this base would belong to Ye Zao. She didn’t expect that ye Zao would cause such a mess. ”

Signing the bet agreement.

Perhaps only a person like ye Zao could do it!

“Hearing this, Sun Qi shook his head. ”

“Seeing Sun Qi like this, Tang Xue knew in her heart. She was very happy, but she did not show it on her face, she sighed and said, “Ever since he got to know Miss Ye, master five has really changed. First, he chased professor Yue out of the base, and now he actually allowed Miss Ye to sign the bet agreement! I really don’t know what he is thinking!” ”

“The few elders were also very angry about professor Yue’s incident. However, professor Yue actually mobilized the entire department to go on strike. If there hadn’t been a strike, they might have sympathized with professor Yue, however, ever since the incident with the strike, they felt that Professor Yue deserved it! ”

Who Didn’t know that Cen Shaoqing hated being threatened the most?

“Not to mention Cen Shaoqing, even they didn’t like being threatened! ”

“”Professor Yue’s matter has already passed!”Sun Qi continued, “Don’t mention this person in the base in the future!” ”

“The smile on Tang Xue’s face froze for a moment, but it quickly returned to normal. “Uncle Sun, I know! Then what about Miss Ye’s matter?” ”

“Leave it to Fate!”Sun Qi sighed.

Wang Zhenzhong shook his head helplessly. “Now we can only leave it to fate!”

“Looking at the backs of the three people leaving, Tang Xue’s face was filled with a smug smile. ”

Good!

This was really great!

“As expected, the wicked will be dealt with by the heavens. Tang Xue was looking forward to two years later more and more! ”

“When that time came, Ye Zao’s face would definitely look very good. ”

“As for Cen Shaoqing, he would definitely regret it! ”

He would regret mistaking a fish’s eye for a pearl!

“Thinking of this, the smile on Tang Xue’s face became even more obvious. ”

...

On the other side.

Cen Shaoqing’s office.

“The room was very quiet, so quiet that one could only hear the sound of flipping a book. ”

“At this moment, the door was opened and the sound of footsteps could be heard. ”

“In his office, other than ye Zao who dared to enter without knocking, almost no one else dared to do so. ”

Cen Shaoqing raised his eyes slightly and saw that the person who came was indeed ye Zhuo.

“To inspect the work?”Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips opened slightly.

“Mm-hm.”Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly.

“CEN shaoqing: “Then please instruct me, leader. What other areas do I need to improve on?” ”

“Don’t be poor.”Ye Zhuo looked at Cen Shaoqing. “I have a serious matter to ask you.”

“”Please instruct me, leader,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Did elder Sun, elder Wang, and elder Chu come to look for you just now?” ”

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“What do you think?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“CEN Shaoqing said, “Of course I’m following the leader’s footsteps.” ”

“Ye Zhuo leaned slightly and rested his hands on the table. He looked at Cen Shaoqing very seriously. Their eyes met. “Aren’t you afraid that I’ll lose the Cen Base?”The matter of the aircraft carrier was no small matter. There were many people in the CEN base who did not trust her, ye Zhuo could understand. ”

“After all, in the history of mankind, no one had ever created an aircraft carrier that exceeded the speed of light! ”

“She was young and had only been famous for a short period of time in the scientific and technological world. It was understandable for people to be suspicious of her. After all, she was betting on the future of the CEN base! ”

“Even if Cen Shaoqing was also suspicious of her, Ye Zhuo could understand. ”

“However, what ye Zao didn’t expect was that Cen Shaoqing firmly believed in her. He even used the future of the CEN base to make her gamble. ”

It would be a lie to say that he wasn’t moved.

“I’m not afraid.”Cen Shaoqing leaned over and kissed her red lips.

“Really?”Ye Zao said.

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “I’ll follow the dog when I marry the chicken. Since I’m already a leader, I’ll follow the leader’s footsteps to the death!” ”

“”Alright, not bad.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “Young people have a bright future!” ”

“It’s all thanks to the leadership’s guidance.”

Ye Zhuo patted him on the head. “I’m too lazy to argue with you. I’ll go back to the office first.”

Cen Shaoqing stood up and walked her out of the door. “I’ll look for you after work.”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “Hurry up and go back to work!”

...

On the other side.

“Zhang Qingqing originally planned to return to her hometown soon. After all, school was already closed. ”

“But after meeting Lin ze yesterday, she changed her mind. ”

She couldn’t go back now.

“It was okay if Lin Ze didn’t fall in love with her at first sight. There was a saying in this world, “Love grows with time.”She had to think of a way to become Lin Ze’s girlfriend and let Lin Ze marry her. ”

Lin Ze’s family background was so good that she really didn’t want to miss out on Lin Ze.

“Moreover, she also had an Lizi as a good assistant. ”

“As long as she had an Lizi’s help and created more opportunities for her to get along with Lin Ze, she believed that she would definitely be able to make Lin Ze fall in love with her after a long time. She wasn’t bad looking, and people had feelings.., lin Ze’s heart wasn’t made of stone. After a long time, he would definitely see her sincerity. ”

Wasn’t there a saying?

A woman chasing a man is separated by a veil.

“After thinking for a while, Zhang Qingqing called an Lizi. ”

“An Lizi was taking a shower, so she naturally did not hear her phone ring. ”

“An Lizi did not pick up her phone. Zhang Qingqing was very anxious and called one after another. Unfortunately, an Lizi did not pick up. ”

“When an Lizi came out of the shower, it was already ten minutes later. ”

An Lizi saw more than twenty phone calls. She thought that Zhang Qingqing had something urgent and immediately called back. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Zhang Qingqing picked up almost instantly.

“”Qingqing, what’s the matter?”An Lizi asked. ”

“”Lizi, what were you doing just now? Why didn’t you pick up my call?”Zhang Qingqing asked. ”

“An Lizi explained, “I was in the shower. Qingqing, is there something urgent?” ”

“Zhang Qingqing continued, “Lizi, did you help me ask your cousin if he has a girlfriend?” ”

“I did.”An Lizi made up a story. “He has a girlfriend.”

“She knew Zhang Qingqing too well. If she said that Lin Ze did not have a girlfriend, Zhang Qingqing would definitely not let it go. ”

“He has a girlfriend? How can that be?”It could be heard that Zhang Qingqing’s voice was very disappointed.

“Do you have anything else?”An Lizi asked.

“Zhang Qingqing frowned. “No, I’ll hang up first.” ”

“After hanging up, Zhang Qingqing sent a wechat message to buttface. ”

What if an Lizi was lying to her?

Zhang Qingqing sent a wechat message.

“A few minutes later, Buttface replied. ”

“The two of them chatted for a while before Zhang Qingqing sent a wechat message. [ I’m really sorry about today. I didn’t know that Lin Ze had a girlfriend. The next time we watch a movie, Ask Lin Ze to bring his girlfriend along. ] ”
