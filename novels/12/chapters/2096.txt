“After entering, he realized that the seemingly ordinary shuttle actually had a different world inside. ”

The small space was actually infinitely large.

There was a cockpit inside.

“The lounge, bedroom, living room, movie hall, and most importantly, a swimming pool. ”

Ye Zhuo came outside.

“At this moment, he received a wechat message from CEN Shaoqing. ”

“[ leader, is it over? ] ”

Ye Zao replied: [ it’s over. ]

“After receiving ye Zao’s reply, Cen Shaoqing came over with snacks. ”

“You really went to get snacks?”Ye Zao asked in surprise.

“Of course.”Cen Shaoqing held the Buddha beads in his right hand and handed the snacks to ye Zao with his left hand. “There’s your favorite flowing heart crisps inside.”

“When she heard the words flowing heart crisps, ye Zao’s eyes lit up. ”

“In her opinion, nothing in this world was more important than tasting delicious desserts. ”

“If she encountered something unhappy, then she would eat some desserts. If one meal was not enough, then she would eat two meals. ”

“Cen Shaoqing looked around the room and continued, “Where’s Ah Ze?” ”

“”He’s researching the interstellar shuttle,”ye Zao said. ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“After eating a piece of dessert, ye Zao seemed to suddenly remember something. He took out a small porcelain bottle from his pocket and handed it to Cen Shaoqing. “By the way, eat this.” ”

“What’s This?”Cen Shaoqing took the porcelain bottle.

“Without waiting for ye Zao to speak, Cen Shaoqing continued, “It can’t be poison, right? You want to... Murder your husband?” ”

Ye Zao curled his lips slightly. “Have you heard of the story of Da Lang taking medicine?”

“”As long as it’s given by the leader, even if it’s arsenic, it can still be eaten.”As soon as he finished speaking, Cen Shaoqing poured out a pill from the small porcelain bottle and swallowed it. ”

“After swallowing it, CEN Shaoqing continued, “When does this medicine take effect?” ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Don’t you feel anything now?” ”

Cen Shaoqing immediately cooperated with Ye Zhuo’s act and fell onto the sofa.

“Before ye Zhuo could react, his wrist was grabbed by someone and he fell onto Cen Shaoqing’s body. ”

The atmosphere became delicate.

Cen Shaoqing hooked his arm tightly around her slender waist. “Will brother-in-law suddenly appear?”

“Who is your brother-in-law?”

“You’re asking even though you already know.”

Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly. “Have you obtained my brother’s approval?”

“When he said that, Cen Shaoqing’s face revealed a slightly uneasy expression. ” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“These days, he had been dreaming about that scene. ”

“Back then, Lin Ze was three years old. ”

He did not expect that a three-year-old child would have such a good memory.

“If he had known that Lin Ze would become his big brother-in-law, Cen Shaoqing would definitely have found an incense table to worship little Lin Ze. Moreover, he would burn three incense sticks every day. ”

Cen Shaoqing replaced the anxiety in his heart with a light kiss on ye Zao’s cheek.

“It was clearly just a kiss, but it stirred up waves in his heart. ”

Even his fingers became extremely hot.

Cen Shaoqing immediately stood up and coughed lightly. “I’m going to the washroom.”

“”Go ahead,”ye Zao said. ”

“About half an hour later, Cen Shaoqing came out of the washroom. ”

“Ye Zao asked casually, “Why have you been gone for so long?” ”

Cen Shaoqing’s expression did not change. “My stomach hurts.”

“Constipation?”Ye Zao asked.

“Cen Shaoqing could only nod his head. Recalling that half an hour, his ears turned slightly red. ”

“Ye Zao said somewhat speechlessly, “If you’re constipated, so be it. No one will laugh at you. Why are you blushing?” ”

Cen Shaoqing pursed her thin lips and did not speak.

“Ye Zao patted Cen Shaoqing’s shoulder and continued, “Don’t worry. I’ll write you a little prescription for constipation later.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing did not directly answer her question. Instead, she said, “What did you just give me to eat?” ”

“”To check the chip in your body.”Ye Zao ate the last piece of snack, then he said, “I suspect that the chip in your body has been implanted into your body when I was pregnant.”Otherwise, it wouldn’t have been discovered so many years ago. ”

“So early?”Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly.

“Ye Zao nodded. “If the one in the General Alliance is really an uncle, then you are the future ruler of the General Alliance. It’s normal for them to be more cautious.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing’s deep eyes were pitch black, and he could not see the end of it. ”

“”If that person in the main alliance is really an uncle, what do you plan to do?”Ye Zhuo looked at Cen Shaoqing. ”

Cen Shaoqing’s face was expressionless. “I want to ask him why he abandoned Grandma and my mother.”

“Back then, the Cen family was old, old, and young. How could Cen Haifeng Bear to part with them? ”

Is fame and status so important?
