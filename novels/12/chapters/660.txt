“Ye Zhuo walked around the three rooms. “Cen Shaoqing, why don’t you stay in my uncle’s room tonight?”After all, this person came to Yun Jing for her, so ye Zhuo couldn’t force him to stay in a hotel. ”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing didn’t expect to have an unexpected surprise. He hid the joy in his eyes and put the prayer beads on the table. “Then I’ll go and clean the bed.”

Ye Zhuo nodded. “The bedsheets and blankets are all in the cupboard. My mother washed them before she left.”

“Okay.”

“At this moment, ye Zhuo suddenly remembered to call his parents and Lin Ze. ”

Ye Zhuo first called Lin Ze.

Lin Ze quickly picked up.

“Brother.”

“”Zhuozhuo, you’re already here?” ”

“”Yes.”Ye Zhuo continued, “Oh right, Cen Shaoqing came with me.” ”

Lin Ze had a bad impression of Cen Shaoqing to begin with. Ye Zao did not wish for any misunderstandings to occur this time.

“Really?”Lin Ze frowned slightly.

“Of course it’s true. You’re my brother. How could I Lie to You?”

“After hanging up the phone, afraid that Lin Ze would not believe her, Ye Zao stood at the door of the room and took a photo of Cen Shaoqing folding the quilt and sent it to Lin Ze’s wechat. ”

Lin Ze looked at the photo that ye Zao sent him.

He felt a little upset.

He had just gotten to know his sister. How could he let the Old Fox swindle her away?

What was worse was that ye Zao was so protective of Cen Shaoqing.

Lin Ze was very angry when he found out that Cen Shaoqing did not go to cloud capital with Ye Zao.

“Now that Cen Shaoqing had gone back with Ye Zao, Lin Ze was even angrier. ”

In the cloud capital.

“After making the bed, Ye Zao ordered takeout. After dinner, he brought Cen Shaoqing to Lin Shasha’s house. ”

Cen Shaoqing bought some other gifts and brought them with him.

“Half an hour later, the two of them appeared at the door of Lin Shasha’s house. ”

Cen Shaoqing was carrying bags of various items. Ye Zao knocked on the door with his fingers.

“Soon, the door opened. ”

The person who opened the door was Zhou Yuelian.

“When she saw Ye Zhuo, Zhou Yuelian thought that she was hallucinating. “Zhuozhuo! ?” ”

Ye Zhuo smiled faintly. “Aunt Lian.” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Only then did Zhou Yuelian realize that she was not hallucinating. She continued to ask, “Zhuozhuo, when did you come back?” ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “I arrived home around one in the afternoon.” ”

“Zhou Yuelian immediately asked, “Then did your parents, your uncle, and your brother Come Back?”Although Zhou Yuelian was in cloud capital, Ye Shu had already informed Zhou Yuelian about this matter through wechat. ”

Ye Zhuo shook his head. “They’re still in the capital. They haven’t come back with me for the time being.”

“”OH.”Zhou Yuelian nodded and her gaze fell on Cen Shaoqing. “Zhuozhuo, this is?” ”

Cen Shaoqing was obviously not an ordinary person. could he be ye Zhuo’s relative in the Lin Family?

Zhou Yuelian had some doubts in her heart.

“After all, she had never seen Cen Shaoqing before. ”

“Ye Zao smiled and introduced him to Zhou Yuelian. “Aunt Lian, this is my boyfriend, Cen Shaoqing.”He then looked at Cen Shaoqing. “This is the aunt Lian I told you about.” ”

“”Aunt Lian, you can just call me little CEN.”Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips parted slightly as he greeted Zhou Yuelian. ”

“Zhou Yuelian did not expect ye Zao to already have a boyfriend. Her eyes were filled with surprise. “Zao Zao, is this the boyfriend you found in the capital?” ”

“Ye Zao continued, “I’ve known him since we were in the cloud capital.” ”

“Zhou Yuelian finally reacted and continued, “Zao Zao, Little Cen, come in quickly!” ”

The two followed Zhou Yuelian into the house.

Cen Shaoqing placed the gifts he brought on the coffee table.

“Zhou yuelian scolded, “Zao Zao! You can remember Aunt Lian and come to visit her. Aunt Lian is already very happy! How can you waste money to bring gifts here!” ”

“Ye Zha smiled and said, “Some of these are special products that my mother specially bought for you in the capital.”After saying that, Ye Zha continued, “Oh right, where are uncle Lin and sister Sha Sha?” ”

“Zhou Yulian said as she brewed tea, “Sha Sha’s father has gone back to his hometown these two days. Sha Sha has gone to the tutoring class and will be back in an hour.” ”

“OH.”Ye Zha nodded slightly.

“Zhou Yuelian brought the tea over. “Zao Zao, Little Cen, have some tea.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing immediately took the Teacup with both hands. “Thank you, Aunt Lian.” ”

“You’re welcome.”

Zhou Yuelian pulled ye Zao and asked him a lot of questions about ye Shu and the Lin family.

Cen Shaoqing sat at the side and listened to the process.

“An hour later, Lin Sha returned. ”

“Lin Sha was very excited to see ye Zao and hugged her. “Zao Zao, why didn’t you tell me you were coming back?” ”
