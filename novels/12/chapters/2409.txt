“Elena found a car and went to the ferry. She found that there was already a long line of people coming back to L continent from the special entrance. She took out her phone and took a photo for Jerry, [ if you want to come back, remember to come over and line up early. ] ”

“After waiting in line for more than two hours, Elena successfully boarded the ferry back to L continent. ”

“In just two days, half of the people from L continent had returned. ”

Cen’s base.

“Professor Zhang came to Ye Zao’s office and said hesitantly, “Miss Ye.” ”

“”Professor Zhang, if you have something to say, just say it,”ye Zao said. ”

“Professor Zhang didn’t know what to say either. He scratched his head and continued, “Miss Ye, have you seen the International News?” ”

“”I have,”ye Zao replied. ”

“Professor Zhang continued, “Lzhou has already developed the perpetual motion machine, but there’s still no movement from the exotic beasts. Many countries have deactivated their defense systems. Do you think we...” ”

“Ye Zao didn’t answer directly. Instead, he said, “Do you know the news of the Exotic Beasts’disappearance?” ”

“Professor Zhang was stunned for a moment, then shook his head. ”

“Ye Zao put down the newspaper in his hand and opened his red lips slightly. “So, the enemy will always only show you what they want to show you.” ”

“As for what they didn’t want to show them, they wouldn’t be able to see it no matter what. ”

“Professor Zhang asked, “When did the exotic beasts go missing? Then isn’t L continent in a mess now?” ”

“”Not yet.”Ye Zao narrowed her beautiful eyes. “Just watch. By that time, there will be corpses everywhere.” ”

She had already done what she had to do.

“Even if there were corpses everywhere, there was nothing she could do. ”

“After all, it was lzhou. If she stretched her hand too far, it would not look good. ”

Professor Zhang was stunned again. “But there are indeed many countries that have signed agreements with Lzhou.”

“After all, it was a perpetual motion machine. ”

“If they did not take a shortcut, the backward countries might not be able to create a perpetual motion machine within a hundred years. ”

“Ye Zao’s expression did not change. He continued, “Don’t worry about them.” ”

Professor Zhang nodded. “Alright.”

“Actually, Professor Zhang was still a little worried. ”

“Although China’s technology had reached the peak of no one, even the most powerful people needed allies. ”

It was not a good idea to keep fighting alone. There had to be an ally.

“Ye Zao seemed to have read Professor Zhang’s mind. He asked, “Professor Zhang, have you heard of a saying?” ”

“What?”Professor Zhang was stunned.

“Ye Zao continued, “Only cows and sheep flock together. Ferocious beasts always travel alone.” ”

Powerful people didn’t need allies.

“This sentence was like an epiphany. Professor Zhang looked at ye Zao and said, “Miss Ye, it’s my fault for not thinking things through.” ”

“Ye Zao continued, “Pay more attention to the defense system these days. Those exotic beasts are very cunning. We Can’t give them any chance to exploit.” ” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Those?

“Professor Zhang noticed this term and raised his head to look at Ye Zao. “Miss Ye, isn’t there only one exotic beast?” ”

“”One?”Ye Zao shook his head slightly and continued, “Professor Zhang, you don’t know these exotic beasts very well.” ”

“How many are there?”Professor Zhang continued to ask.

“Ye Zao’s beautiful eyes narrowed slightly, and he continued, “You should ask how many groups there are.” ”

“How many groups?”Professor Zhang asked in disbelief.

“Ye Zao nodded slightly. “There are fifty to sixty groups of these exotic beasts in a group. At the moment, they are at least five groups.” ”

“So Many?”Professor Zhang asked.

“”This is just the beginning,”ye Zhuo continued, “When the prison is officially completed, the number of exotic beasts will increase.” ”

“Professor Zhang was also a smart person. He continued, “Miss Ye, do you mean that l continent is now a prison?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“At that time, the people trapped in the prison would all become food for the exotic beasts. ”

“Although it sounded cruel, it was the truth. ”

“Professor Zhang continued, “Then, with so many people lining up to enter Lzhou every day, aren’t they courting death?” ”

“”You can say that,”ye Zao said. ”

“Once they entered lzhou, there was no way for them to survive. ”

“Professor Zhang couldn’t watch as so many living beings walked on the road to extinction. He continued, “Can, can we help them? Tell them the truth!” ”

“”Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “But, do you think they will believe you?” ”

“Professor Zhang opened his mouth. After a moment, he continued, “No matter what the outcome is, I still want to try and save each and every one of them.” ”

He could not stand by and watch these people seeking death.
