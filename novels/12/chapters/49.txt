Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Hearing Ye Zhuo confidently say that she would not lose money, He Fengxian laughed out loud.

“Little girl, let me tell you the truth, don’t be angry! Your shop is no longer faces the problem of losing money. You now face the problem of whether it closes down or not! Listen to my advice. You have just opened your shop, hurry up and sell it before you lose too much money!”

It had been half a day since the shop opened, but there were still no customers. One really wondered where Ye Zhuo got all her confidence from.

She was a pretty little thing. Unfortunately, she was not very bright. She was not made for business.

A regretful look flashed across He Fengxian’s eyes as she said, “I still have a lot of stuff to handle at my shop, so I won’t talk to you anymore. I’ll go back first.”

“Big Sister He, remember to drop by when you’re free.” Ye Shu smiled and sent her out of the door.

A moment later, Ye Shu walked in with a face full of sorrow. “Zhuo Zhuo, why don’t... why don’t we sell this shop...” Originally, Ye Shu was also full of confidence. She felt that as long as she persisted, she would definitely be able to do well in the business.

However, seeing that there wasn’t a single customer on the first day of the restaurant’s opening, Ye Shu slowly lost all her confidence.

Ye Zhuo smiled and held Ye Shu’s hand. “Mom, don’t be discouraged. It’s not meal time yet! Go prepare 150 servings of spicy rabbit head first, and then 150 servings of appetizers. I guarantee that when it’s time to eat, there will definitely be customers coming to eat.”

Ye Shu frowned. “Zhuo Zhuo, these things can’t be stored. If no one comes to eat them, wouldn’t it be a waste?”

There wasn’t a single customer in the shop, yet Ye Zhuo asked her to prepare more than a hundred portions of everything. Was she joking?

“Mom, don’t worry. It won’t go to waste,” Ye Zhuo said with a smile.

Since Ye Zhuo was so sure of it, Ye Shu helplessly obliged, “Alright then...”

It would be a waste if it went to waste.

However, it seemed that Ye Zhuo was also the kind of girl who wouldn’t back down until she hit a wall.

When Ye Shu finished preparing everything and walked out of the kitchen, she saw a short-haired girl with a cell phone come into the shop. “Excuse me, is this the Ye family’s Private Kitchen at 612 Bacheng Road?”

Ye Shu was stunned and quickly stood up. “Yes, yes!” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

The short-haired girl smiled and said, “It’s quite difficult to find you here! I redeemed this coupon from the online Takeaway website. It says that you are giving away a free appetizer. Is that true?”

Ye Shu was stunned.

What coupon? Were they giving out free appetizers?

At this moment, Ye Zhuo walked over with a smile and said, “Yes, of course! Let me see your coupon.”

When she saw Ye Zhuo, the short-haired girl was stunned.

‘Oh my goodness!

‘This young lady is too beautiful!

‘What kind of god-like beauty is this!’

The short-haired girl was stunned for a moment before handing her phone to Ye Zhuo.

Ye Zhuo looked at the phone and led the short-haired girl to a seat by the window. “Come and sit here. You’ve redeemed the coupon on your phone. This is the free appetizer. It’s called Ice Forest. Try the appetizer first, and when you’re done, you can place your order.”

“Thank you!” The short-haired girl continued, “Then, if I don’t like your appetizer, can I refuse to place an order?”

“Yes, of course.” Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “If you ‘re ready to order, you can call me anytime.”

The short-haired girl was extremely impressed with this young lady’s attitude and service!

She was just joking when she said that she might refuse to order any food. She didn’t expect the young lady to actually agree.

After Ye Zhuo left, the short-haired girl took a bite of the appetizer.

When she redeemed the coupon online, she did not expect a free appetizer to taste above average.

The short-haired girl’s eyes lit up and she quickly took a second bite. She did not expect to taste such an amazing appetizer!

Delicious!

It was really too delicious!

It was better than any appetizer she had eaten before.

“Miss! I’m ready to order!” The short-haired girl waved at Ye Zhuo.

Ye Zhuo walked over with the iPad. “What would you like to eat?”

While eating the appetizer, the short-haired girl said, “There’s a special promotion today for spicy rabbit heads, right? I want two rabbit heads and a hotpot for the set meal. By the way, I don’t eat duck blood. Can you change the duck blood in the set meal to tofu?”

“Sure.” Ye Zhuo nodded. “Please wait for a while.”

At this moment, another young couple walked in. “Is this the Ye Family’s Private Kitchen?”

“Yes.” Ye Zhuo quickly walked over and invited the customers to sit down. Then, she served the complimentary appetizer.

Ye Shu was completely stunned. After the couple ordered the dishes, she pulled Ye Zhuo to the side and asked, “What’s going on, Zhuo Zhuo?”

Ye Zhuo explained with a smile.

It turned out that Ye Zhuo had signed up on an online gourmet food platform three days ago, and she had also set up a website to advertise their special promotion.

Afraid that the traffic of the website would not be enough, Ye Zhuo had even specially written a script for this to increased the publicity.

As a result, it attracted a lot of customers.

It was the era of technology and information. All the old methods of doing business would not get them enough customers. She had to keep up with the times.

This was the reason Ye Zhuo was feeling so confident.

Ye Shu nodded. “I see.” If she were the one in charged of the business, she would only end up losing money! Her daughter was indeed capable!

As they were talking, a new customer walked in. Ye Zhuo said, “Mom, hurry up and prepare the dishes. That table over there also ordered spicy rabbit head. I’ll go and attend to the new customers!”

“Okay.” Ye Shu nodded and immediately went to the kitchen.

In less than half an hour, the originally empty restaurant was already half-filled.

The air was filled with the fragrance of the food, it made people swallow their saliva.

The first customer, which was the short-haired girl, specially ordered ten spicy rabbit heads for takeaway when she paid the bill. “Miss, your dishes are really delicious, especially this spicy rabbit head! Next time, I’ll bring my parents over to eat it.”

“Thank you.” Ye Zhuo smiled slightly. “Next time, I’ll give you a discount. This is our exclusive membership card!”

“Oh my God! Thank you, Miss!” The short-haired girl excitedly took the membership card.

When she left the restaurant, the short-haired girl even took a photo of the restaurant and posted it on her moments. ‘This new Ye Family’s Private Kitchen in Yunjing is simply too delicious! It’s one in a million! Relatives who live near Bacheng Road, don’t miss it!’

The closer it was to meal time, the more people came in to the shop.

Seeing that the business in the restaurant was so good, Ye Shu was suddenly full of energy and didn’t feel tired at all.

It wasn’t until two o’clock in the afternoon, when the meal time had passed, that the number of customers gradually decreased.

After working for half a day, the mother and daughter hadn’t eaten a single grain of rice. Taking advantage of their free time, Ye Shu cooked two bowls of noodles.

After cooking the noodles, Ye Shu took out a bowl and brought it over to Ye Zhuo.

Ye Zhuo was sitting at the cash register, looking down at her phone.

She was completely focused.

The screen displayed all English, so Ye Shu couldn’t understand a single word. She handed the bowl in her hand to Ye Zhuo and said, “Zhuo Zhuo, it’s time to eat.”

“Oh, okay.” Ye Zhuo reached out her hands to take the bowl of noodles. While eating the noodles, she continued doing missions.

Ye Zhuo did not have the habit of looking at international forums. Little did she know that the international forums were all talking about her.

Niohuru.Qiangguo and Yudi said, ‘F*ck! Daddy YZ has already completed twenty quests in two days!’

Happy 1985 commented, ‘Daddy is awesome! Daddy is awesome!’

Niohuru.Tower’s Eighth Brother commented, ‘F*ck! Twenty quests in two days. That’s an average of ten quests a day. Is he even human?’

An average mission that was posted on international websites, even if it was considered simple, would take at least three days to complete. Niohuru.YZ had completed 20 missions in two days. One could imagine how terrifying Niohuru.YZ’s strength was!

Hua Qi XL commented, ‘Allow me to make a conspiracy theory. Actually, Niohuru.YZ is not a single person, but a team of a thousand people. After all, ordinary people do not have such strength!’
