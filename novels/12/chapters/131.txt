Chapter 132: 082: How Does It match with her? She doesn’t even have the slightest discernment! 5

It’s a pity that the heavens don’t appreciate beauty.

“It’s Alright, Grandma. Those uncles didn’t have time to come back to accompany you. It’s the same for me to accompany you.”Feng Xianxian hugged Old Lady Lin’s arm and began to act coquettishly.

“Alright!”Old Lady Lin patted Feng Xianxian’s hand with a face full of smiles.

However, a look of disgust flashed across Feng Xianxian’s eyes.

That was because she was especially sensitive to the old man’s smell.

But now, Feng Qianhua had not married into the Lin family and her position was not stable, so she could only endure it.

One day, she would be rewarded for tolerating it.

At this moment, Old Lady Lin seemed to have suddenly remembered something, “Oh right, Qianhua, a few days ago, director Wang from the south sent some tonics over. Bring some back to your mother later. Tell her that it’s my return gift of hundred flowers nectar.”

It was good to have a return gift.

Old Lady Lin’s return gift was equivalent to an imperial edict in the Feng family.

In fact, this was not just a return gift. It also represented Old Lady Lin’s love and recognition for her.

Although she was very happy, Feng Qianhua still said, “Aunt Lin, we’re all family. You Don’t have to be so polite.”

Old Lady Lin smiled and said, “I’m giving it to your mother, not to you. You’re not allowed to reject it!”

Since she had already said that, Feng Qianhua naturally would not reject it.

There was a smug look in her eyes.

In the afternoon, Old Lady Lin’s four sons came back with their wives and children.

The huge Lin family suddenly became lively.

Feng Qianhua was like the mistress of the Lin family, busying herself.

In fact, Old Lady Lin’s four daughters-in-law did treat Feng Qianhua as one of their own. After all, in all these years, besides Feng Qianhua, no other woman had appeared beside Lin Jincheng.

...

Cloud capital.

In the afternoon, Mu Yourong punctually went to the restaurant to look for Lin Xuan.

Only after she went to the restaurant did she realize that Xue Lin was there as well.

“Yourong.”

The two sisters greeted her warmly.

Although Lin Xuan was a great lawyer and was usually as proud as a kaolin flower, she still had to lower her head when she saw Mu Yourong, the genuine eldest daughter of a prestigious family.

“Eldest cousin sister, second cousin Sister.”Mu Yourong walked over with a smile.

“Sister yourong, quickly sit down.”

Mu Yourong leaned over and sat down, seemingly unintentionally saying, “Today is the first day of the New Year. Why are the two sisters free to accompany me and have coffee? Could it be that Auntie Ye didn’t bring Sister Ye Zao to Your House to pay New Year’s greetings?”

Xue Lin smiled and answered, her tone flat, “Our family has already severed relations with their family!”

Even though ye Shu was Xue Lin’s aunt, she had never admitted that ye Shu was related to her and had always called her by her first name.

“Severed ties?”Mu Yourong looked at Xue Lin in surprise, “How could this be?”

Xue Lin took a sip of her coffee and a layer of disgust appeared in her eyes, “Their family comes knocking on our door every day. No matter how rich our family is, we can’t help but be so extravagant!”! My mother saw how pitiful ye Shu was and introduced her to a big boss. She didn’t expect that not only did ye Shu not know how to be grateful, she even indulged that trash ye Zhuo and injured the big boss! A bunch of ungrateful things!”

Mu yourong nodded, “I see, then they really don’t know what’s good for them! I saw Auntie ye open several restaurants and thought that your family invested in her. From the looks of it, that shouldn’t be the case.”

“Restaurant?”Xue Lin frowned, “You mean ye Shu?”

“Yes,”mu yourong continued, “The restaurant is on Ba Cheng Road. Before the holidays, business was especially good, and there was a queue almost every day! “Also, Auntie Ye and the others moved out from the basement. I also heard that Auntie Ye has already spent 20 million to buy that restaurant... <per_0> . .”

Lin Xue isn’t the only one with her eyes wide open. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Even Lin Xuan felt incredible.

What’s 20 million?

The total value of the family’s assets is only 30 million.

But Ye Shu took out 20 million without batting an eyelid.

You know, before ye Shu, just live in the dark basement.

It was simply unbelievable!

“Yourong, could you have made a mistake?”Lin Xuan stirred the coffee.

Even she did not have the ability to earn 20 million.

How did ye Shu earn it?

Could it be... that she was a rich person on the list?

It must be so.

Although she hated ye Shu, she could not deny that ye Shu was indeed quite beautiful.

This person was also disgusting!

That day ye Shuang introduced Li Hongwei to her also hypocritically said that she did not play third fiddle for others.
