Chapter 103: 075: dinner, thousands of miles to thank you! 3

Feng Qianhua smiled and said, “Xianxian, that child, just looks sensible. In fact, she doesn’t have peace of mind. Besides, girls are more sensible than boys.”

At the mention of Feng Xianxian, Old Lady Lin’s expression softened a little, then, she said, “Xianxian’s birthday is in a few days, right? Xianxian is the only granddaughter of our Lin family. At that time, I have to prepare a gift for her.”

Old Madam Lin had long treated Feng Xianxian as her biological granddaughter, so she did not shy away from her words.

“She’s just a child, why would she need a present for her birthday! Aunt Lin, you’re not allowed to spend money!”

Old Madam Lin rebuked, “It’s not for you! I’m preparing it for my granddaughter!”

“Don’t say such things in the future,”Feng Qianhua continued, “I know that little sister Ye Shu has always been in Jin city’s heart. Aunt Lin, I’ve never had any delusions of marrying him! I just need to know that brother Jin Cheng is living a happy life.”

Hearing this, Old Madam Mo looked at Feng Qianhua with an additional layer of heartache.

It had been so many years.

This child was still so kind.

Eighteen years ago, if she had fought for it, she would not have given ye Shu a chance.

From this, it could be seen that being too kind-hearted was not a good thing.

Old Madam Lin patted Feng Qianhua’s hand. “What nonsense are you talking about! You are the only daughter-in-law in my heart. Unless I close my eyes and leave, Jin Cheng will not be able to marry another woman!”

Feng Qianhua had already wasted 18 years of her youth for Lin Jin city.

Old Mrs. Lin would never allow her to wait another 18 years.

Thinking of this, Old Mrs. Lin sighed again.

“Qianhua, what do you think you are doing by my side all day? Go and accompany Jin city. Oh right, I asked someone to boil some tonic soup for Jin city. You can send it to him later.”

If Feng Qianhua had put all her attention on Lin Jin city, she would have married Lin Jin city long ago.

“Brother Jincheng needs to rest now, so I Won’t disturb him,”Feng Qianhua refused directly.

Old Mrs. Lin held Feng Qianhua’s hand and continued, “Aunt Zhang is right. That child, Ah Ze, doesn’t know how to think of danger in times of peace. I was hoping that you would give our Lin family another child.”

“Aunt Lin!”Feng Qianhua said with a red face, “Don’t tease me with Aunt Zhang!”

“I’m not teasing you!”Old Mrs. Lin said seriously, “You and Jin city are still young, what’s there to be afraid of having a child?”

After saying that, old Mrs. Lin asked the servant to bring the tonic soup over and handed it to Feng Qianhua. “Go! Go quickly!”

Helpless, Feng Qianhua could only bring the tonic soup to Lin Jin city.

The car stopped at the Beijing Hospital.

Feng Qianhua went straight to the inpatient department on the seventh floor.

Lin Jincheng was staying in a VIP suite.

There were two bodyguards guarding the door.

Lin Jincheng’s bodyguards did not know Feng Qianhua, so they stopped her.

Feng Qianhua smiled and said, “Old Lady Lin asked me to deliver the soup to brother Jincheng.”

The two bodyguards looked at each other. One of them opened the door and went in. After a while, he came out. “The boss asked you to give the soup to me.”

Feng Qianhua was stunned for a moment. Then, she handed the thermos to the bodyguard. “Well, how is your boss recovering?”

The bodyguard said very officially, “The boss is recovering very well. You Don’t have to worry.”

A trace of haze flashed in Feng Qianhua’s eyes.

Lin Jin Cheng had always been like this.

He didn’t give her any chance.

If he hadn’t been so heartless, she wouldn’t have married Feng Qianqian’s biological father in a fit of anger.

But this time, she would never let go of Lin Jincheng’s hand.

She would definitely take the position of Mrs. Lin!

Definitely!

That position belonged only to her!

Feng Qianhua pinched her fingers, her eyes flashing with determination.

On the other side.

Because she had promised Cen Shaoqing that she would treat him to dinner on Saturday night, Ye Zhuo went out for a walk during the day and spent the evening in the hotel looking for a restaurant.

After finding a vegetarian restaurant with a good reputation online, ye Zao looked up at Lin Sha and said, “Sister Sha Sha, let’s go out for dinner tonight.”

“You’re treating that Mr. Cen to dinner?”Lin Sha asked.

Ye Zao nodded slightly. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Lin Sha held her phone and said, “I won’t go, Zao.”

“Why?”Ye Zao asked in confusion.

Lin Sha continued, “Mr. Cen’s aura is too strong. I Can’t Hold It! Every time I get into his car, I feel like I Can’t Breathe...”

Lin Shasha was not lying.

She was really a little afraid of Cen Shaoqing. Although he was very handsome, amazing, and devoted to Buddhism and vegetarianism, that kind of fear came from his bones and could not be controlled.
