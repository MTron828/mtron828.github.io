“Chapter 1826: 375: other than Miss Ye, no one else has the right! 2”

Translator: 549690339

“Xu Chaonan was merely Xu Xiao’s aunt. She said that if she did not let Xu Xiao find a boyfriend, Xu Xiao would not find a boyfriend? ”

How was that possible!

“Mother Xu looked upstairs, then, she said, “Our Xiao Xiao did not crawl out of her stomach in the end! There is a difference between this niece and her biological daughter! If Xiao Xiao was her biological daughter, she would definitely be giving suggestions now!” ”

It was precisely because Xu Xiao was not Xu Chaonan’s biological daughter that Xu Chaonan looked indifferent. He even suggested that Xu Xiao not fall in love for the time being.

“If a girl did not fall in love, she should find a good family to marry off to. What else did she want to do? ”

Was she the same as Xu Chaonan?

To stay at home and be an old lady?

“It was fine if Xu Chaonan could not marry off himself, but now he wanted Xu Xiao to not be able to marry off as well! How could there be such an aunt in the world? ”

“”Xiaoxiao, I can see that your aunt does not treat you as a niece at all. She wants nothing more than to make you a second her!” ”

Father Xu looked at mother Xu. “Would it kill you to say less?”

“Hearing that, mother Xu immediately flew into a rage. She pointed at father Xu and said, “Your sister has treated you and your daughter so well, yet you still defend her. This biological brother and sister are indeed different! In the end, only the two of us are outsiders!” ”

“As she said that.., mother Xu continued, “I’ve really had eight lifetimes of bad luck. I actually married a person like you. I don’t have anything I want. I don’t even have a decent house and I still need my sister to take care of me! Why is my life so miserable!” ”

“As she said that, mother Xu was about to cry. ”

“”Mother, what are you doing?”Xu Xiao was a little speechless as she said, “My father didn’t say anything. Can you not be so sensitive? Does it sound good when aunt hears it?” ”

“Mother Xu was still very obedient to Xu Xiao. When she heard this, she immediately stopped talking and only said, “Don’t listen to your aunt. Hold he ziteng well!” ”

“Okay.”Xu Xiao nodded.

“Even if mother Xu didn’t say it, she would hold he ziteng well. ”

...

On the other side.

He ziteng was very nervous now.

He was worried that Xu Xiao would not accept him.

“After all, Xu Xiao was the second girl he had confessed to. ” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

The first girl he had confessed to was an Lizi.

“However, it could be that he had done it in the wrong way, causing an Lizi to take a detour when she saw him now. ”

What he ziteng still could not figure out was how he had offended an Lizi.

One had to know that he had put in a lot of effort when chasing an Lizi.

“He ziteng was thinking about something, so his experiments kept making mistakes. ”

“Seeing this, Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly. “What’s wrong? What are you thinking about?” ”

“He ziteng finally reacted. “I’m sorry, I’m Sorry! Fifth sister-in-law, I didn’t do it on purpose!” ”

“”It’s okay. It’s almost over.”Ye Zhuo finished the finishing work and continued, “Are you okay?” ”

“He ziteng said somewhat embarrassedly, “To tell you the truth, fifth sister-in-law, I confessed my love yesterday.” ”

“Really?”Ye Zao said with some surprise.

“Of course it’s true.”He ziteng nodded. “But the other party hasn’t agreed yet.”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “It seems that you’ve Met Your True Love?” ”

“”Of course!”He ziteng continued, “She’s different from any girl I’ve met. After I win her over, I’ll treat you and fifth brother to a meal.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“After the experiment, he ziteng left the base. ”

“As soon as he left the base, he ran into Ouyang Chen. ”

“Mr. He.”Ouyang Chen took the initiative to greet him.

“He ziteng greeted her politely, “Miss Ouyang.” ”

“Ouyang Chen looked at he ziteng and said, “Mr. He, I’m really sorry about what happened last time.” ”

“”It’s okay. Let bygones be bygones.”Ever since Old Lady Cen came to the He family and mentioned the matter between him and Ouyang Chen, he ziteng had no good impression of Ouyang Chen. ”

“Firstly, Ouyang Chen was not his type. ”

“Secondly, Ouyang Chen had left a deep shadow on him. ”

“Ouyang Chen smiled and said, “Mr. HE, in order to express my apology to you, why don’t we find a place to eat? I’ll personally accompany you to drink and apologize.” ”

“No need.”He ziteng directly refused.

“Although he ziteng had already clearly refused, Ouyang Chen still didn’t want to give up. ”

“After all, he ziteng was the first boy who made her so moved. ”

She didn’t want to miss he ziteng!

“”Then where are you going now, Mr. He? I’ll go with you.”As she spoke, Ouyang Chen followed he ziteng’s footsteps. ”
