Feng Qianhua picked up her cup and clinked it with Jiang Su ran’s. “Then I wish us a happy cooperation.”

“”A happy cooperation,”Jiang Su ran said with a smile. ”

“After chatting with Jiang Su ran for about half an hour, Feng Qianhua left the coffee shop. ”

Jiang Su ran sat in her seat and looked at Feng Qianhua’s back. A smile appeared on the corner of her mouth.

“Everyone knew that the old lady of the Lin family treated Feng Qianhua very well and treated her like her own child. Even the daughters-in-law of the Lin family could not compare to Feng Qianhua. With Feng Qianhua’s introduction, she would definitely be the fourth lady of the Lin Family! ”

“Lin Qingxuan had a weak personality and was easy to control. When that time came, the person in charge of the Lin family would naturally be her. ”

...

Lin family.

Ye Zhuo sat at the computer desk and searched for information from nineteen years ago.

She followed the clues.

“She had already discovered many clues, but she could not come to a conclusion yet. ”

Nineteen years had passed and many things were already blurred. She still needed some time to verify and implement them.

“Looking at the information on the computer screen, the corners of Ye Zhuo’s mouth curled up slightly. ”

She was looking forward to the day when the truth would be revealed!

“At this moment, the sound of footsteps could be heard from outside the door. ”

“Ye Zao looked back slightly and saw Li Yueyue walking in with a big fat cat in her arms. “Big Zao Zao, this cat is so cute! Did you raise it?” ”

“Like all girls, Li Yueyue liked to pet cats very much. ”

Ye Zao closed the computer. “This is my brother’s pet.”

“Your brother’s?”Li Yueyue looked at ye Zao in surprise.

“She didn’t expect Lin Ze, who looked cool on the outside, to have a fat cat. ”

Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“Li Yueyue stroked the fat cat in her arms. “I didn’t expect your brother to like cats too! I thought boys liked dogs! By the way, what’s its name?” ”

“”It’s called brother Meow,”ye Zhuo answered. ”

“Brother Meow?”Li Yueyue asked.

“Meow!”Brother Meow in her arms raised his head and meowed.

“Li Yueyue said in surprise, “Damn! It can understand human language!” ”

Brother Meow raised his head and licked his paws proudly.

Ye Zhuo reached out and touched brother Meow. “It really does understand human nature.”

“At this moment, someone knocked on the door. ”

Ye Zhuo walked over to open the door.

“It was the maid at home, Auntie Qian. ”

“”Miss, there’s a delivery for you outside. It says that you need to sign it.” ”

Ye Zhuo nodded and followed Auntie Qian outside to receive the delivery.

Li Yueyue also carried brother Meow and followed.

“The delivery boy was waiting outside. “Hello, is this ye Zhuo?” ”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “It’s me.”

The delivery man tore off the delivery form. “Please sign here.”

The delivery was a very large cardboard box.

It was rectangular in shape and about 1.5 meters tall. It was very heavy.

“Auntie Qian said, “Miss, I’ll get two people to carry the items in.” ”

Ye Zao smiled slightly. “No need. I’ll be fine by myself.”

“As soon as he said that, ye Zao picked up the delivery and walked into the house. ”

He looked extremely dashing!

Auntie Qian and Li Yueyue were left in a mess in the wind.

“F * CK, F * ck! ”

He was too strong!

“After a long while, Li Yueyue finally reacted. She carried brother Meow and caught up with Ye Zao. “Da Zao, Why Are You So Strong? What did you eat to grow up?” ”

Li Yueyue came from the grassland. The children on the grassland were all very strong because they drank milk and ate beef and mutton all year round.

“However, they were still not as strong as ye Zhuo. ”

Ye Zhuo put the express delivery on the ground and raised his eyebrows slightly. “Could it be spinach?”

“Li yueyue said thoughtfully, “It seems that I have to eat more spinach in the future! By the way, what’s In Your Box?” ”

“Ye Zhuo said as he opened the express delivery, “A cleaning robot.” ”

“OH.”Li Yueyue nodded.

“Not long after, Ye Zao opened the box. ”

“Inside lay a robot made of two black and white circular objects. It looked very worn out and did not look like a robot. Instead, it looked like it was picked out from a trash can. ”

“Li Yue Yue frowned. “Zao Zao, this is your floor-sweeping robot?” ”

“Yes.”

“Li Yue Yue touched her chin and asked suspiciously, “Can this thing really sweep the floor?” ”

Ye Zhuo installed the power source.

Di —

“”Not only can it sweep the floor, it can also wash dishes, mop the floor, clean the windows, and bring its own search engine! It is the most powerful all-purpose sweeping robot in the Universe!” ”Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m
