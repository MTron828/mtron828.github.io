Chapter 2685: 593: worrying over nothing

Translator: 549690339

Ye Sui was determined to buy the villa.

“After all, Ye Shu bought more than 100,000 yuan worth of jewelry for her today without even blinking. This meant that ye Shu had tacitly agreed to her spending. ”

The villa in the capital was only 100 million yuan.

100 million yuan was nothing to ye Shu?

It was not even a drop in the ocean.

“Most importantly, Ye Shu was her sister. She was ye Shu’s sister. ”

So what if her sister bought a house and asked her sister to pay for it?

This was a matter of course.

“Ye Sui continued, “When the time comes, let your father see if he has the ability or if I have the ability!” ”

“When she first came, her husband had a look of disapproval. ”

“After all, ye Sui’s previous actions did not leave a good impression on ye Shu. He was afraid that ye Shu would ignore ye Sui. ”

“This was also the reason why their son, Zhou Libang, did not follow them. ”

“Women suffered a little when they were wronged, but Zhou Libang was their son! He was the root of the Zhou family! ”

“Zhou Ziyue glanced at ye Sui and then said, “Mom, don’t be happy too early.” ”

Ye Sui snorted. “Just see if I’m happy too early or if you’re worrying over nothing!”

“Zhou Ziyue didn’t say anything else and continued, “I’m going back to my room to rest.” ”

“”Go ahead.”Ye sui nodded and reminded, “Remember to chat with Bai Jingshu more often.” ”

“Okay.”Zhou Ziyue nodded and turned to leave.

Zhou Ziyue was very tired today.

Physically and mentally exhausted.

“After returning to her room, Zhou Ziyue had just laid down on the bed when her cell phone rang. ”

Zhou Ziyue took out her cell phone to take a look. It was a video call from Feng Yang.

“At this moment, Zhou Ziyue suddenly resisted this call, but she still picked it up. ”

“The next second, Zhou Ziyue’s face was filled with smiles. ”

“Feng Yang.”

“Feng Yang’s handsome face appeared on the other end of the screen. “Ziyue, where did you guys go to play today?” ”

“Hearing this, Zhou Ziyue’s heart was even more resistant. ”

What did Feng Yang mean by this?

To investigate her whereabouts.

“Zhou ziyue said, “We went to a nearby scenic spot to play today.” ”

“How was it? Was it fun in the capital?”Feng Yang asked. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“”It was alright,”Zhou Ziyue said. ”

Feng Yang asked some irrelevant questions.

“Zhou ziyue became more and more impatient. She continued, “I ran outside for a whole day today. I’m so tired now. I’m going to sleep for a while. You should sleep early too. Don’t stay up late at night.” ”

“Okay.”Feng Yang nodded. “I know. Go to sleep then.”

“After ending the video call, Zhou Ziyue let out a deep sigh. ”

What should she do now?

Should she break up with him?

She didn’t know.

She wasn’t willing to not break up with him. She wasn’t willing to live an ordinary life.

“But if she broke up with him, she was afraid that she would regret it. She would regret missing out on such an outstanding man like Feng Yang. ”

“After all, her friends were very envious of her when she was with Feng Yang. ”

Du Du du —

“At this moment, there was a knock on the door. ”

“Zhou Ziyue immediately got up from the bed, tidied up her hair, and walked over to open the door. ”

The door opened and the nanny of the Lin family stood outside.

“”Hello,”Zhou Ziyue took the initiative to say. ”

“The nanny smiled and said, “Miss Zhou, Young Madam invites you over for some fruit.” ”

This young madam was naturally referring to Bai Jingshu.

Zhou Ziyue nodded. “Alright.”

“After all, this was a rare opportunity to interact with Bai Jingshu. ”

“Bai Jingshu’s place was quite a distance away from the guest room, and they had to go through the garden to reach it. ”

“Because Bai Jingshu loved flowers and plants, ye Shu had specially chosen the bridal room near the garden when they were renovating the bridal room. Therefore, as long as Bai Jingshu pushed open the window, she would be able to see all sorts of flowers, if it was a windy morning, she would be able to smell the fragrance of flowers. ”

“Zhou Ziyue silently sized up the garden. Although this was not her first time here, every time she came, she would be extremely surprised and sigh at the Lin family’s financial resources. ”

It was really good to have money.

“As long as it was something she could think of, she could use money to solve it. ”

“Soon, the nanny brought Zhou Ziyue to Bai Jingshu’s courtyard. ”

“”Young Madam, Miss Zhou is here.” ”

“Ziyue is here.”

“Bai Jingshu was busy cutting fruits. “Sit down, sit down.” ”

“After saying that, Bai Jingshu looked at Zhou Ziyue and asked, “Ziyue, what fruits do you like to eat?” ”

“Other than the usual apples and bananas, there was also a pile of fruits that Zhou Ziyue had never seen before. ”

“Bai Jingshu picked up a bunch of fruits that looked like longan. “Ziyue, you can try this dragon palace fruit later. It’s very good. And this, this is a harvest fruit...” ”

“Okay.”Zhou Ziyue nodded.

The two of them chatted while eating the fruits.

“Zhou Ziyue looked around and continued, “Where’s the baby?” ”

“Bai Jingshu said, “Sister-in-law is taking him with her.” ”

“The small iron pillar was too annoying and needed someone to carry it around. Sometimes, when Bai Jingshu’s arm got sore, she would ask sister-in-law to take it with her. ”

“OH.”Zhou Ziyue nodded.

“At that moment, Bai Jingshu seemed to have thought of something and said, “Right, ziyue, I have something to give you.” ”

Zhou Ziyue was stunned.

Bai Jingshu took out a jewelry box. “Open it and take a look.”

“Zhou Ziyue refused. “No, no, no. Jingshu, I can’t accept your gift.” ”

“She had only known Bai Jingshu for a short while. If she accepted Bai Jingshu’s gift now, she would definitely leave a bad impression on Bai Jingshu. ”

“Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “It’s fine. You can keep it. I bought it especially for you.” ”

“Zhou Ziyue still refused. “Jingshu, I came in a hurry and didn’t prepare a gift for the baby. I really can’t accept it.” ”

Bai Jingshu stuffed the gift into Zhou Ziyue’s hands. “Take it. I hope you’ll like it.”

How should she put it.

“Although Lin Ze had already instructed Bai Jingshu to take Zhou Ziyue’s place, Bai Jingshu still felt that Bai Jingshu was a friend worth befriending. ”

“At least, she didn’t see any schemes or other things in Zhou Ziyue’s eyes. ”

“Seeing that she couldn’t refuse, Zhou Ziyue had no choice but to accept it. She looked up at Bai Jingshu and said, “Thank you.” ”

“”You’re welcome.”Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “We’re all relatives.” ”

“After saying that, Bai Jingshu said again, “I heard that you guys want to buy a house in the capital, right?” ”

Zhou Ziyue nodded. “That’s what my mom is planning.”

“Bai Jingshu said, “Then we can go out more in the future.” ”

“Sure.”Zhou Ziyue did not expect that she would get along with Bai Jingshu so quickly. Everything was much simpler and smoother than she had imagined.

It was already an hour later when they returned from Bai Jingshu’s room.

“Zhou Ziyue endured the urge to not open the gift box on the way back. After she returned, she immediately opened it. ”

“As soon as she opened it, Zhou Ziyue’s face was filled with surprise. ”

Inside the gift box was an open-mouthed bracelet from a famous luxury brand.

“Bai Jingshu knew how to earn money, but she also knew how to spend money. She had no concept of money. Just this one bracelet was enough to compete with the gold jewelry that ye Sui had bought this afternoon. ”

“A rich lady was a rich lady, and her first gift was six figures. ”

“Zhou Ziyue held the bracelet, and her expression was unclear. ”

“When would she become like Bai Jingshu, who gave people gifts that were as high as six figures? ”

“Obviously, Feng Yang would not be able to fulfill her wish. ”

On her own?

Impossible!

“Her monthly salary was less than ten thousand Yuan, and she had to work for more than a year to buy a bracelet. This was even when she was frugal. ”

Perhaps it was really time to break up.

“Just then, there was a knock on the door. ”

Zhou Ziyue stood up and went to open the door.

The person standing outside the door was none other than ye Sui.

“Mom.”Zhou Ziyue opened the door.

“Ye Sui walked inside, closed the door, and said impatiently, “I heard that Bai Jingshu looked for you?” ”

“Yes.”Zhou Ziyue nodded.

“Ye Sui continued to ask, “Why did she look for you?” ”

Zhou Ziyue took out the bracelet. “She gave me this.”

“The bracelet looked very nice and had a strong design. Unfortunately, ye Sui only knew about gold and did not know about luxury items. He frowned slightly and said, “She gave you this thing?” ”

She was trying to trick a child!

She was really stingy!

Zhou Ziyue looked at ye Sui. “Do you know what brand this is?”

“What brand?”

“Dr.”

“OH.”Ye Sui’s reaction was very calm.

“Zhou ziyue continued, “Why don’t you ask about the price?” ”

“It’s obviously not something from before. What’s there to ask?”Ye Sui said.

“Zhou Ziyue chuckled. “Mom, you’re wrong! This bracelet is even more valuable than the gold jewelry you bought this afternoon.” ”

“What did you say?”Ye Sui widened his eyes.

“Zhou ziyue said, “This is a luxury item. It’s worth 130,000 yuan.” ”

“”That’s it?”Ye Sui said in disbelief, “Don’t be fooled by Bai Jingshu!” ”

“She couldn’t tell that such a small thing was worth 130,000 yuan. ”

“”It’s clearly priced. She can’t Fool Me,”Zhou Ziyue said. ”

Ye Sui gulped and looked at Zhou Ziyue. “Is it really that valuable?”

“”Yes,”Zhou Ziyue nodded. ”

“”Tsk,”ye Sui continued, “This rich person is really different. He’s selling bracelets worth more than 100,000 yuan.” ”

Zhou Ziyue sighed. “Who says so!”

“Life was really unfair. Some people were born to stand at the top of the pyramid, but some people were still struggling for food and clothing at the bottom! ”

“Ye Sui looked at Zhou Ziyue. “So, you haven’t thought about it yet?” ”

“Hearing that, Zhou Ziyue wanted to say something, but in the end, she didn’t say it out loud. She just said, “We’ll talk about it later.” ”

She was also very annoyed now.

“In the blink of an eye, the next day arrived. ”

Ye Shu was still leading ye Sui and Zhou Ziyue to play around the capital.

“Ye Sui had already planned the route. “Little Shu, I want to see the house today. Why don’t we pass by the sales office on our way back and take a look?” ”
