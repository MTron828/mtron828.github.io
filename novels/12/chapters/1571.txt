“What suffering? As her mother, she had to bear it together with Zhang Qingqing! ”

“Mom! Let’s Go!”Zhang Lei wanted to pull his mother back.

“However, mother Zhang did not agree to go with him. ”

“Father Zhang frowned and said, “Let’s Go First!” ”

“Even if those people outside were angry, they would not make things difficult for the two women. ”

“Zhang Qingqing looked as if she had been provoked. Her expression was dull as she stared at the floor and kept repeating, “It’s Lin Ze’s! It’s Lin Ze’s! My child is the heir of the Lin Family! He’s the heir of the Lin Family!” ”

“Looking at Zhang Qingqing like this, mother Zhang’s heart ached. She hugged her tightly, “Qingqing, Oh Qingqing, my poor child! Those people outside are trying to drive us to our deaths!” ”

“No matter what mother Zhang said, Zhang Qingqing kept repeating these words. ”

On Weibo.

“Public opinion had been fermenting, and now it had reached a climax. ”

Zhang Qingqing’s comments on Weibo had directly exceeded a million.

“As far as the eye could see, there was a sea of abuse. ”

The next day.

The hotel staff sent the mother and daughter a lawyer’s letter from the Lin Corporation.

“When she saw the lawyer’s letter, mother Zhang’s heart turned cold. She thought that the LIN Corporation was just saying that. She didn’t expect that they would really send a lawyer’s letter. ”

“In fact, there was a reason why the legal department of the LIN Corporation did this. ”

This was to make an example out of others.

“If the Lin Corporation didn’t do anything this time, there would be a next time. ”

“Although father Zhang had left with Zhang Lei, there was still a lawyer’s letter. ”

The impact of this incident was not small.

“A false police report was made to frame someone for rape, followed by slander... ”

“After the trial, Zhang Qingqing was sentenced to five years in prison. ”

Zhang Qingqing’s parents were sentenced to three years.

“Due to her pregnancy, Zhang Qingqing was released on bail pending trial. ”

“When the results of the court were announced, the internet was filled with cheers. ”

[ retribution for evil. ]

“[ how could he be released on bail pending trial? If not for the surveillance video, Lin Ze’s life would have been ruined by Zhang Qingqing! ] ”

“[ release on bail pending trial is because Zhang Qingqing is pregnant. Adults are guilty, but the child in her womb is innocent! But don’t worry, after she gives birth to the child and passes the lactation period, she will still go to jail! ] ”

“This is so satisfying! I want to buy some meat to celebrate!”

“One more upstairs.”

“Not only did this matter not have any impact on the LIN Group, but it also increased the exposure of the LIN Group. ”

“For a week in a row, the shares of the LIN Group rose by the daily limit! ” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

At the Lin Family Manor.

“In order to celebrate the end of this matter, Lin Jincheng personally cooked and invited old Mrs. Cen, Zhou Xiang, and Cen Shaoqing as guests. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen sat at the dining table and said with a smile, “I didn’t expect Jincheng to have such craftsmanship.” ”

“After saying that, she turned to look at Cen Shaoqing. “Learn more from your father-in-law! Don’t just recite sutras all day. Go to the kitchen more often when you have time.” ”

“Although Cen Shaoqing had learned a lot, he still liked to recite sutras and Buddha. ”

Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddha beads. “Nod.”

Lin Qingxuan and Xia Xiaoman arrived late with an Lizi.

“When they saw Lin Ze, Lin Qingxuan and Xia Xiaoman felt very guilty. ”

“The couple stood in front of Lin Ze and said shamefully, “Ah Ze, I’m really sorry. If it weren’t for our Lizi, you wouldn’t have been almost schemed against.” ”

“”Fourth uncle, fourth aunt, you’re exaggerating! This matter is also my own fault.”Lin Ze stood up. “I was too careless.” ”

An Lizi was still a little embarrassed to look at Lin Ze.

This matter was indeed her fault!

“Old Madam Lin sat beside Old Madam Cen. Seeing that Lin Qingxuan and an Lizi’s attitude towards admitting their mistakes was pretty good, her anger subsided quite a bit. She continued to speak, “Lizi isn’t young anymore. Remember to be more mindful in the future. She should know what to do and what not to do!” ”

“An lizi immediately said, “Yes. Grandma, I understand.” ”

“Old Mrs. Lin looked at an lizi and continued, “Alright, sit down and eat! The food will be cold soon!” ”

An Lizi sat beside ye Zao and everyone began to eat.

Time passed quickly.

“In the blink of an eye, it was the spring festival. ”

On the third day of the first lunar month.

“Lin Jincheng, Ye Shu, brought Lin Ze and Yazhuo back to Yun Jing. ”

“On the fourth day of the first lunar month, the family went to Lin Shasha’s house with gifts to pay New Year’s greetings. ”

“Zhou Yuelian and Lin Jinshui, with the help of Ye Shu, had also opened a restaurant. ”

“The days were getting more and more prosperous, and they had already changed into a high-end apartment. ”

“It had four rooms and one living room, and they lived very comfortably. ”
