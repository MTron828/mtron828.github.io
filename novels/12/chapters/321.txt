He suddenly felt the air was sweet!

“When the secretary saw him come out, he quickly stood up. “Master Five.” ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “Inform Xiao Li that I’m going to the hospital.”

Go to the hospital?

The Secretary was shocked!

“He had been by Cen Shaoqing’s side for more than ten years, but he had never seen Cen Shaoqing go to the hospital. ”

“Because he was especially sensitive to the smell in the hospital, even if he had a cold or a fever, he would never go to the hospital. ”

“Today, he actually took the initiative to go to the hospital... ”

What was going on?

Could it be that he was seriously ill?

The secretary informed the driver Xiao Li in surprise.

“When Cen Shaoqing walked to the company building, the driver Xiao Li was already ready. ”

Just like the secretary.

Xiao Li was also very surprised.

“When the hospital director learned that Cen Shaoqing was coming, he specially stood at the hospital entrance early to wait for him. ”

He opened the VIP channel for him.

“”CEN fifth master, please come in.” ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“As the deputy director walked, he asked, “May I ask what is wrong with you?” ”

“When he saw Cen Shaoqing tell him his symptoms in a serious manner,. ”

The deputy director was very nervous.

“When he saw a person, his heart would beat faster, his breathing would be rapid, and he would be unable to control himself..? ... wasn’t this because of love? ”

“This master, could it be that he was here to make me happy? ”

“However, seeing how serious Cen Shaoqing was, it didn’t seem like he was joking. ”

“At this moment, CEN Shaoqing continued, “Give me a full-body CT scan.” ”

Full-body CT scan?

“Since the Big Boss had spoken, the deputy director couldn’t say anything more. “Alright, please follow me this way.” ”

After a round of inspection.

“The deputy director took the report form and walked in front of Cen Shaoqing. He smiled and said, “Master Five, Congratulations. Your indicators are all normal. There are no problems.” ”

“Normal?”Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly and took the report form. “Are you sure?”

“The deputy director nodded. “Yes, I’m very sure.” ”

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “Are there any hidden problems that haven’t been found?” ”

“The deputy director said, “Fifth Master, don’t worry. The machines that our hospital uses are all imported. There won’t be any mistakes.” ”

“Then why do I keep feeling uncomfortable?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“The deputy director considered his words in his heart and continued, “If I may ask, is the person who made your heart beat faster and your breathing faster a girl?” ”

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded.

The vice president was stunned!

Was fifth Master Cen’s EQ so low as to stand at the top of the pyramid?

He didn’t even know what she liked?

He didn’t know which family’s girl was so lucky.

To be able to make fifth master Cen so worried!

“The vice president continued, “Aren’t you sick?” ”

“Then what is it?”Cen Shaoqing frowned.

The deputy headmaster looked up at Cen Shaoqing and tried his best to be tactful. “This is probably because... you have fallen in love with her.”

Fallen in love?

Cen Shaoqing was stunned.

That was what the Internet said.

And now the headmaster was saying the same thing again.

Could it be... that he had really fallen in love with ye Zao?

“”If you like someone, your breathing will become rapid and your heartbeat will quicken?”After a long while, Cen Shaoqing finally spoke. ” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“The deputy hospital director adjusted his glasses. “Occasionally, I might even dream about her.” ”

Cen Shaoqing was stunned again.

Yes.

The deputy hospital director was right.

Ye Zhuo had indeed been fond of running into his dreams recently.

All the way until he returned from the hospital.

Cen Shaoqing kept repeating the same sentence in his mind.

“... You’ve fallen in love with her.”

“Cen Shaoqing sat on the boss’s chair, puffing and puffing. In an instant, he had smoked a pack of cigarettes. ”

At this moment.

A wechat notification sounded in the air again.

Was It ye Zao?

Cen Shaoqing quickly picked up his phone and unlocked it.

Unfortunately.

It was not from ye Zao.

“It was from his second sister, Cen Yueya. ”

“[ Shaoqing, when are you, Grandma, and mom going back to Beijing? ] ”

Cen Shaoqing was about to reply.

“At this moment, he received a message from ye Zao, [ Have You Been to the hospital? ] ”

Cen Shaoqing immediately replied to Ye Zao. [ I’ve been to the hospital. The Doctor said that I’m fine. ]

Fine?

Ye Zao was stunned at the other end of the screen.

It seemed that there was nothing wrong with her medical skills.

“However, if Cen Shaoqing was fine, why would she have the symptoms of shortness of breath and rapid heartbeat? ”

[ take a picture of the CT report and send it over. ]

“Cen Shaoqing immediately took out the CT report, placed it on the table, and took a picture of it. ”

Ye Zhuo opened the photo.

Everything on the CT report was indeed normal.

“Her gaze landed on the ashtray in the upper left corner of the CT report, and she raised her eyebrows slightly. ”

The monk still smoked?

It seemed that he was quite addicted to smoking.

“[ it’s good that you’re fine. [ dog head ] Oh, right, smoking is bad for your lungs. Although your lungs haven’t been diagnosed with any problems yet, if this goes on, your lungs will definitely be blackened! ] ”
