A moment later.

“The butler replied, “Old Master, there are no more flights to the capital. Can you buy the tickets for tomorrow at 5 am?” ”

Zhou Zuolong could not wait to fly to the capital immediately. How could he wait until tomorrow morning!

“”Look for scalpers to think of a way,”Zhou zuolong continued, “Money is not a problem!” ”

“The butler continued, “Master, we have already looked for scalpers, but we really don’t have tickets for today!” ”

“What about the high-speed train and the bullet train?”Zhou Zuolong asked.

The Butler shook his head. “There aren’t any either!”

“After saying that, the butler continued, “However, there are trains! But the train takes 24 hours. If you want to go by train, you might as well wait for the plane tomorrow morning.”The plane would only take four hours. ”

“Father Zhou scratched his head anxiously. “Think of something! Think of something first. If there is really no other way, I’ll take the Five o’clock Flight Tomorrow Morning.” ”

“Alright.”The butler nodded.

At the hospital.

“Zheng Wanyin held Xie Wanqiu’s hand and said, “Grandma, don’t worry. Grandpa said that he will come over immediately! When she comes over, he will definitely make the decision for us.” ”

“Xie wanqiu pressed her temples. “When your Grandpa comes over this time, I will let him settle the matter between you and Shaoqing! It will save us a lot of trouble!” ”

“Initially, Xie Wanqiu did not plan to let Zhou Zuolong take action on this matter. ”

“However, things had already come to this point, so she could only continue to follow this step. ”

“She was Cen Shaoqing’s step-grandmother, but Zhou Zuolong was Cen Shaoqing’s real biological grandfather, Zhou Xiang’s biological father. ”

Could it be that Zhou Xiang would not listen to her biological father?

“Once Zhou Zuolong came, Zhou Xiang would be finished! ”

“Not only did Xie wanqiu want to settle the marriage between Zheng Wanyin and Cen Shaoqing, she also wanted Zhou Xiang to kowtow to her and admit her mistake! ”

That B * Tch Zhou Xiang.

She would definitely not let her off easily!

“Xie wanqiu pinched her fingers, and her expression was very ugly. ”

“Zheng Wanyin sighed. “Grandma, now that we have such a bad relationship with second aunt and brother-in-law, and cousin already has a girlfriend, let’s forget about this matter.” ”

“”Forget about it? Why should we just forget about it? ! This marriage should have been yours to begin with!”Xie wanqiu continued, “If it weren’t for Ye Zhuo, we wouldn’t have gotten to where we are today, and Zhou Xiang wouldn’t have suddenly fallen out with me! “A beautiful woman is a disaster. We haven’t even passed the marriage yet, and so many things have already happened. If we passed the marriage, would we still have the right to speak?” ”

“From Xie Wanqiu’s point of view, these things were all ye Zao’s fault. ”

“After all, the cause was that ye Zao deliberately gave Zheng Wanyin 1a. ”

She was hospitalized because of this 1A!

Ye Zao was the Jinx of the Cen family.

“Zheng wanyin continued, “Grandma, cousin is so outstanding. I, I simply don’t deserve him.” ”

“”Who said I don’t deserve him? Who said I don’t deserve him!”Xie wanqiu was very excited, “In this world, no one is more worthy than you! You Are the Phoenix’s life, and only you will bring good luck to the Cen family! Ye Zhuo is the Jinx, and she will defeat the Cen Family!” ”

There was only one Phoenix’s life.

Zheng Wanyin was more than one in ten thousand.

“Zheng Wanyin was a little embarrassed. “Grandma, I’m not as good as you say!” ”

“At this moment, her phone suddenly rang. ” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Zheng Wanyin picked up the phone.

“Who called?”Xie wanqiu asked.

“”It’s grandpa,”Zheng Wanyin replied. ”

Xie wanqiu narrowed her eyes. “Pick up quickly.”

Zheng Wanyin nodded and picked up the phone.

“It was unknown what was said on the other end of the phone, but Zheng wanyin continued, “Okay, Grandpa, I got it. Yes! I’ll take good care of Grandma.” ”

“After hanging up, Xie wanqiu asked, “What did your Grandpa Say?” ”

Zheng Wanyin frowned. “Grandpa said that he can’t buy today’s plane ticket. He will only be in Beijing at ten o’clock tomorrow morning. He asked me to take good care of you.”

“”That trash!”Hearing that, Xie Wanqiu was very unhappy. “Can’t you count on him to do something!” ”

Zheng Wanyin was also a little disappointed.

She had originally thought that Zhou Zuolong was really good to her.

But now it seemed that.

It was not entirely true.

“If she was Zhou Zuolong’s biological granddaughter, Zhou Zuolong would have rushed over long ago. ”

But Now?

Zhou Zuolong actually said that he did not have a plane ticket for today and would only arrive tomorrow.

“Without a plane ticket, did he not know how to think of a way? ”

A plane ticket was dead.

But a person was alive.

“If Zhou Zuolong really treated them as family, he definitely would not be like this. ”

No wonder Xie wanqiu would betray Zhou Zuolong.

“It was not that she was completely disappointed in Zhou Zuolong, but Xie wanqiu would definitely not do such a thing. ”

“Zheng wanyin continued, “Since Grandpa is not able to come for the time being, let’s wait.” ”
