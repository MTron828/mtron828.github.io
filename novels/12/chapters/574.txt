Translator: 549690339

Zhao zhuangzhi?

Lin Qingxuan was instantly enraged. “Who does Zhao zhuangzhi think he is! What right does he have to marry my niece?”

“Zhao shuning frowned, “Lin Qingxuan! Do you know who you’re talking to? Why is Zhuangzhi not worthy of ye Zao! If he’s not worthy, it’s because ye Zao isn’t worthy of Zhuangzhi! To be able to marry into our Zhao family! I wonder how many lifetimes she’s been blessed!””

“Looking at Zhao shuning whose facial features were close to ferocious, Lin Qingxuan felt that this woman in front of her was extremely unfamiliar.”

She had lied to him for twenty-one years.

She had stirred up trouble in the entire Lin family.

“Previously, she had instigated Old Lady Lin to change ye Zao’s name, and now she was thinking of introducing ye Zao to Zhao Zhuangzhi.”

“The veins on Lin Qingxuan’s face popped up, and the depths of his eyes became extremely scarlet.”

Zhao shuning was frightened by this Lin Qingxuan.

“They had been married for twenty-one years, but she had never seen Lin Qingxuan like this.”

“After all, Lin Qingxuan didn’t even dare to say anything harsh to her normally, but today, Lin Qingxuan not only talked back to her, but also looked at her with this expression.”

What happened to Lin Qingxuan?

Did something happen at the hospital today?

Zhao shuning narrowed her eyes.

“Lin Qingxuan clenched her fists, her whole body trembling. “Zhao shuning! Say It Again!””

“Zhao shuning snorted, “Lin Qingxuan! You’ve grown up, haven’t you? Now you dare to Talk Back to me! What’s wrong with me saying it again? It’s already good enough for a wild girl like Ye Zhuo to fancy her! She’s lucky to be able to marry into our Zhao family!””

Before Zhao shuning could react...

Slap

Lin Qingxuan raised her hand and gave Zhao shuning a slap.

Zhao shuning was stunned.

“Lin Qingxuan did not show any mercy with this slap. She was slapped to the ground, and her face was in so much pain that she lost consciousness. Blood dripped from the corner of her mouth.”

“The left side of her face instantly swelled up,”

old Lady Lin was shocked by this sudden scene.

“One had to know that out of all the daughters-in-law in the Lin family, she liked Zhao shuning the most.”

But today!

Lin Qingxuan actually hit Zhao shuning in front of her!

It was a rebellion!

It was really a rebellion!

“”Qingxuan! What are you doing!”Old Madam Lin raised her hand and slapped Lin Qingxuan, then went to help Zhao shuning. “Shuning, are you okay?””

“After a long while, Zhao shuning finally reacted. She raised her head and looked at Lin qingxuan, saying hysterically, “Lin Qingxuan! I even gave up my right to be a mother for you, but you actually hit me today! Are you even human!”” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“”Not only will I hit you today, but I will also clean up the Lin Family!”Lin Qingxuan looked at Zhao shuning and said word by word, “Zhao shuning, I want to divorce you!””

“In fact, Lin Qingxuan didn’t want to divorce Zhao Shuning in the beginning. He planned to have a good chat with Zhao shuning.”

“But now, there was no need to continue chatting.”

“As long as Zhao Shuning was around, the Lin family wouldn’t be able to live in peace.”

“So, this marriage had to be divorced!”

“What did you say?”Zhao shuning was stunned. She never dreamed that Lin Qingxuan would divorce her one day.

Could it be that Lin Qingxuan really had someone else outside?

Who was that person?

No Way!

“She couldn’t divorce Lin Qingxuan, no way!”

“Zhao shuning suppressed the fear in her heart, she said angrily, “Lin Qingxuan, you want to divorce me, right? If you dare to divorce me, I’ll tell everyone what you can’t do! I’ll let everyone know that it’s you, Lin Qingxuan, who can’t do it! You’re not a man!””

Tell Everyone?

“Hearing this, Old Lady Lin’s face turned pale.”

“If this matter was blown up, where would the Lin family put their face?”

“”Shuning, don’t worry! As long as I’m here, Qingxuan won’t divorce you!”After saying this, old madam Lin looked at Lin Qingxuan, “Unfilial son! Hurry up and apologize to shuning! Ask her to forgive you!””

Zhao shuning took the initiative to take the blame for Lin Qingxuan’s infertility.

Wasn’t it ungrateful for Lin Qingxuan to ask for a divorce now?

“Other than Zhao shuning, what other woman could do what she did? Who else could give up on becoming a mother at such a young age?”

“At the end of her sentence, Old Mrs. Lin said harshly, “If you dare to divorce shuning, we’ll sever our mother-son relationship!””

“Lin Qingxuan lowered her head and looked at old Mrs. Lin, “Mom, we’ve all been deceived by her! We’ve been deceived by her for 21 years. In fact, the one who’s truly infertile is her, Zhao Shu Ning!””
