“These very straightforward words directly exposed Bai Mo’s darkest side. Bai Mo stood rooted to the ground, her face alternating between green and white. It was a bit like the color palette, very beautiful. ”

“If there was a crack in the ground, Bai Mo would immediately crawl into it. ”

“After saying this, man Wen turned around and walked. As he walked, he told his assistant, “Don’t reveal my schedule to those messy people in the future.” ”

Random.

“Upon hearing this, Bai Mo’s color turned even paler. It turned out that in man Wen’s heart, she could only be considered a random person. ”

How could she be a random person! !

“The assistant was also slightly stunned. Under normal circumstances, they would definitely not reveal man Wen’s schedule, but Bai Mo was different. Bai Mo was Bai Jingshu’s sister, and Bai Mo was one of the few people who could speak to man Wen, after a while, the assistant thought that Bai Mo was a different person. Initially, she thought that Bai Mo would become a different person in Manwen’s heart, but she did not expect to be eliminated so quickly. ”

“Looking at Manwen’s back view, Bai Mo felt very indignant. She had spent so much time on Manwen, but in the end, she had actually changed the label of ‘Messy Person’. ”

It was all Bai Jingshu’s fault!

“It must have been Bai Jingshu who had spoken ill of her beside man Wen. Otherwise, man Wen would never have hated her so much! ”

“At this moment, Bai Mo’s entire body was trembling. ”

She had never been humiliated like this in her entire life. This was the first time.

“Damn it, Bai Jingshu! ”

“If it weren’t for Bai Jingshu, she would never have become like this. ”

What kind of Cousin was Bai Jingshu? !

How many cousins were like her?

“Momo! Momo!” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Bai Yuanyuan’s voice suddenly sounded in the air, but Bai Momo could no longer hear anything. It was only when Bai Yuanyuan walked over and patted her shoulder that she asked, “Momo, what are you thinking about?” ”

Only then did Bai Momo react. She turned around and looked at Bai Yuanyuan. “Why are you here?”

“”I’m here to take a look around and buy some star energy. By the way, have you seen Manwen?”Bai Yuanyuan asked. ”

“It would have been better if Bai Yuanyuan had not said that. However, when Bai Yuanyuan said that, Bai Mo was in a bad mood. “What do you mean? Are you looking at me as a joke?” ”

“Bai Yuanyuan was stunned. “Momo, what’s Wrong?” ”

“You didn’t see it?”Bai Mo narrowed his eyes.

“See what?”Bai Yuanyuan was a little confused. She was even more confused as to why Bai Mo was suddenly so angry. Could it be that something had happened between her and man Wen?

“Bai Mo calmed down a little. Since Bai Yuanyuan didn’t see that scene, she naturally wouldn’t reveal her scars. She continued, “Who do you think is more powerful, Ye Han or man Wen?” ”

“Bai Yuanyuan thought for a moment. “Ye Han is the monarch of Changyue Kingdom and also Miss Ye’s younger brother. If we have to compete, naturally, Ye Han is more powerful.” ”

Changyue kingdom was conquered by Ye Zhuo alone.

But Manxing kingdom was different.

Manxing kingdom was the inheritance system.

“Bai Mo narrowed her eyes and said, “From today onwards, Manwen and I can not live under the same sky!”Actually, she had been in the wrong direction from the beginning. She should not have tried to conquer Manwen. She had no foundation with Manwen, but Ye Han was different.., she and Ye Han were good friends to begin with. ”

“”AH? What happened, Mo Mo?”Bai Yuanyuan asked in surprise. ”

“Bai Mo continued, “You don’t need to know the specific reason. You only need to know that I will be the first lady of changyue country in the future.” ”

Bai Mo was still very confident in conquering ye Han.

Bai Yuanyuan was stunned. “But... but ye Han already has a girlfriend.”

“Not long ago, Ye Han had officially announced to Shi Qingcheng that the two of them were really lovey-dovey. How could Bai Mo possibly get involved in such a crucial period. ”

“You can get a divorce even if you’re married. So what if you have a girlfriend?”Bai Mo retorted.

Shi Qingcheng had only known ye Han for a few days?

How could she compare to the relationship between her and Ye Han.

“Before Shi Qingcheng appeared, she and Ye Han were best friends. Otherwise, ye Han would not have introduced Lin Ze to her. ”

“Ye Han must have already been interested in her at that time. He was too embarrassed to express his feelings for her, so he pushed Lin ze out. ”

“Thinking of this, Bai Mo felt a little regretful. ”

“She regretted that she did not seize the opportunity in time and said to Ye Han, “Just introduce yourself to me.”. ”

“However, it was not too late. Perhaps ye Han was dating Shi Qingcheng to anger her and make her take the initiative to attack. ”
