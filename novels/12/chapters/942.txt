Translator: 549690339

Cen Yuyan’s words were filled with righteous indignation. It was as if she had seen what ye Zhuo had done with her own eyes.

Old Mrs. Cen was so angry that her face turned red. She raised her hand and slapped Cen Yuyan’s face.

PA!

Cen Yuyan’s face was slapped to the side.

“You Ungrateful Thing!”

“Cen Yuyan covered her face and looked at Old Mrs. Cen. “Who is ungrateful? The ungrateful person is clearly you! If it weren’t for you, would our family have become like this?” ”

“If it weren’t for old Mrs. Cen, Cen Shaoqing would have been with song Chenyu long ago. ”

Why would there be anything with ye Zao?

Cen Shaoqing was with Ye Zhuo because of old Mrs. Cen.

“If it wasn’t for old Mrs. Cen threatening him with death, Cen Shaoqing definitely wouldn’t have put on such an act. ”

Yes.

“In Cen Yuyan’s view, all of this was Cen Shaoqing putting on an act. ”

Whether it was publicly admitting that ye Zhuo was his girlfriend or something else.

It was all Cen Shaoqing putting on an act for old Mrs. Cen.

“Old Madam Cen was already quite old. As her grandson, Cen Shaoqing did not want her to have any regrets in her later years. ”

“Yet, Old Madam Cen was still so foolish that she did not know anything and treated ye Zao as a treasure. ”

“Now, for Ye Zao, she even hit her biological granddaughter. ”

This was simply unreasonable!

Old Madam Cen felt that she was about to suffer a heart attack from Cen Yuyan’s aura. She clutched her chest and panted heavily. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Zhou Xiang pointed at Cen Yuyan and said, “How can you talk to your grandmother like that? Quickly apologize to your grandmother!” ”

“”Apologize?”Cen Yuyan snorted. “I’m not in the wrong, why should I apologize! The one in the wrong is her. She only knows how to take advantage of her seniority! She even has to count the money for others when she’s cheated!” ”

“”Cen Yuyan!”Looking at Cen Yuyan like this, Zhou Xiang, who had always been calm, also changed his face. “You’re too much!” ”

“”Was it me who went too far, or did you guys go too far?”Cen Yuyan’s eyes were red as she said, “Now, I’m the one who was beaten up, I’m the one who was kicked out of the house, and I’m the one who was wronged! Now, you guys are actually pointing at my nose and scolding me for going too far! Is there no room for reasoning in this world?” ”

“Ever since Old Mrs. Cen brought ye Zhuo to the Cen family, the Cen family had been in complete chaos. ”

“Now, even she had been chased out by old Mrs. Cen. ”

“If ye Zhuo had not stirred up trouble in front of Old Mrs. Cen, why would old Mrs. Cen chase her out of the family? ”

“Old Mrs. Cen raised her walking stick. “You Little Bastard, I’ll break your legs today!” ”

“”Mom, calm down.”Zhou Xiang was so scared that she hugged old Mrs. Cen. ”

“After all, it was a public place. If Old Mrs. Cen caused any trouble and was photographed by someone who wanted to post it on the Internet, the loss would not be worth it. ”

“”Xiang Xiang, let go of me!”Old Mrs. Cen was furious. “Let me break that little bastard’s leg!” ”

Cen Yuyan walked in front of old Mrs. Cen. “Beat him up! beat him up! I want to see if you can break my leg today! You did something wrong and you still won’t let others say it! Who Do you think you are?”

“Others were afraid of Old Mrs. Cen, but Cen Yuyan was not. ”

So what if Old Mrs. Cen was her grandmother?

“No matter who it was, they had to bear the corresponding responsibility for doing something wrong. ”

She would not forgive Old Mrs. Cen just because she was her grandmother!

“Shut up!”Zhou Xiang pushed Cen Yuyan away.

Bang!

“Cen Yuyan was not prepared, and she did not expect Zhou Xiang to make a move on her. She was pushed to the ground by Zhou Xiang just like that. ”

“Mom?”Cen Yuyan raised her head to look at Zhou Xiang. “When did you become like Grandma?”

“Although Cen Yuyan didn’t like Old Lady Cen very much, she didn’t have any objections to Zhou Xiang as a mother. ”

But she didn’t expect Zhou Xiang to actually make a move on her.

“Zhou Xiang looked at Cen Yuyan and frowned. “Yuyan! When did you become like this? You Can’t even differentiate between good and bad! Today, don’t blame your grandma for breaking your legs! I can’t even stand it anymore!” ”

“Cen Yuyan stood up from the ground. “Haven’t you already severed your relationship with me? Since you’ve already severed your relationship, you don’t have the right to ask about my matters! From now on, my matters have nothing to do with you!” ”

Cen Yuyan said everything that she had hidden in her heart. She felt extremely carefree and continued:

“”Let me tell you, even without you, I can still live a very happy life! Didn’t you say that Zhou Rui fell in love with the Cen family’s fourth young mistress? “But I’m not the Cen family’s fourth young mistress now. I didn’t spend a single cent of the Cen family’s money. Seeing that I’m living so well, aren’t you all very disappointed? “Let me tell you, this is just the beginning! “I’ll be happier in the future!” ”
