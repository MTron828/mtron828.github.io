Translator: 549690339

“Actually, Lin Jincheng had never really carried a child before. When Lin Ze was carried back by Old Lady Lin, Lin Jincheng was lying on the hospital bed. It was not until Lin Ze was ten years old that he woke up. ”

“He had missed out on a lot of things, causing Lin Ze’s childhood memories to only include the nanny, grandma, and Feng Qianhua and her daughter. ”

“Ye Shu took the child from ye Zao’s hands. “This child, you have to hold him like this. Gently, Slowly.” ”

“”I know, I know,”Lin Jincheng said. “Give me a hug.” ”

“”Be careful,”ye Shu said. ”

“”Okay.”Lin Jincheng carefully took the child from ye Shu’s arms. After holding it, he felt very strange. He looked at ye Shu and said, “He, he, why is he so young?” ”

He was too small!

“He felt that he could leak out of Ye Shu’s arms at any time, but he didn’t dare to use too much force. If he used too much force, he might accidentally hurt the child. ”

“”It’s only a little more than eight pounds. How Old Do you think it is?”Ye Shu continued, “Do you know how to hold it? If you don’t know how to hold it, give it to me.” ”

“”I know, I know.”Lin Jincheng nodded and continued, “I think tie Zhu looks like Jingshu. Do you think he looks like her?” ”

“Ye Shu said, “He does look a little like her, especially that nose. Look at how beautiful it is! And that eyebrow. It’s exactly the same as Jingshu’s.” ”

Ye Zhuo touched his nose. “Why can’t I Tell?”

“”You’re blind.”Ye Shu looked at Cen Shaoqing. “Shaoqing, can you tell?” ”

“CEN Shaoqing said, “I’m blind too.” ”

Ye Zhuo laughed out loud.

“Ye Shu said, “Look at the two of you. You’re singing along.” ”

“”Mom, I really can’t tell how you look like sister-in-law.” ”

“At this moment, Ye Shu looked into the delivery room. “Why isn’t your sister-in-law coming out yet?” ”

“It’s fine. Didn’t brother go in? Let’s Wait a little longer. She should be out soon.”Ye Zhuo wasn’t very clear about the nursing situation after the obstetrics surgery.

“Ye Shu nodded and looked at the child in Lin Jincheng’s arms. She smiled and said, “Can our little Tiezhu wait for Mommy a little longer?” ”

Little Tiezhu slept very soundly and did not have the time to pay attention to Ye Shu.

“”The more I look at Tiezhu, the more he looks like Mommy.”Ye Shu continued, “He also looks a little like daddy. Our Ah Ze must have looked like this when he was young.” ”

This sentence made Lin Jincheng feel a little sad.

“Fortunately, those things were all in the past. ”

“At this moment, tie Zhu suddenly opened his eyes. The newborn child’s vision had not fully developed. His vision was blurry, and his eyes were not as clear as before. In fact, they were a little cloudy. ”

“”Look, he opened his eyes.”Ye Shu said somewhat excitedly, “Look, who does the baby’s eyes look like?” ”

“”Phoenix eyes, like aunt,”Lin Jincheng said. ”

“Hearing this, ye Zao said, “Let me take a look.” ”

“Although the little guy’s eyes were small, he could indeed see the Phoenix eyes. ”

“”My Brother also has Phoenix Eyes,”ye Zao said. ”

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “My nephew looks like aunt. He will be a lucky child in the future.” ”

“Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly. “Of course. With an amazing aunt like me around, how can he not be Lucky?” ”

“Hearing that, Ye Shu smiled even more happily. “In the future, your nephew’s skin will definitely be as thick as yours.” ”

“Is my skin thick?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “What do you think?” ”

Ye Zhuo turned to look at Cen Shaoqing. “Do you think my skin is thick?”

“Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads and said seriously, “It’s not thick at all.” ”

“That’s more like it.”

“Ye Shu said, “I can finally see that Shaoqing will be a strict wife in the future.” ”

“If this was said by anyone else, Cen Shaoqing would definitely refute it, but in front of Ye Shu, he did not have the courage. ”

“After all, this was the grandmother of the future child. ”

“Ye Shu said again, “Zhonghua, you are not allowed to bully Shaoqing in the future.” ”

“Ye Zhonghua said, “It’s not certain who is bullying who. Mom, why do you always turn your back on others?” ”

“Shaoqing is so honest. How can he bully you!”Ye Shu said.

“Honest?”Ye Zhuo looked at Ye Shu in surprise. “Why do you think he’s honest?”

Cen Shaoqing was really too honest!

“Ye Shu said, “If Shaoqing isn’t honest, what kind of boy is honest?” ”

“Ye Shu did not know in front of others, but Cen Shaoqing was indeed a rare good child in front of elders like them. ”

“He had to have ability, looks, and looks. He was simply the best son-in-law. ”

“Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads and echoed, “Auntie is right. I am indeed very honest.” ”𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m
