“Really?”Feng Ying was overjoyed.

She never thought that the old lady would agree to her conditions so easily.

That’s great!

That’s really great!

She wanted to tell Tina the good news immediately.

The old lady nodded very seriously. “Of course it’s true!”

“”Grandma, thank you.”Feng Ying hugged the old lady. ”

“After getting the jade, she immediately left China. ”

“After leaving C nation for so long, she had wanted to go back a long time ago! ”

“Silly child.”The old lady patted Feng Ying’s back. “There’s no need to thank Grandma.”

“Feng Ying quickly let go of the old lady and said, “Grandma, I have other things to do. I’ll go out for a while. I’ll come back to accompany you later.” ”

“”Okay.”The old lady smiled, but Feng Ying did not notice it. ” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“When Feng Ying’s figure completely disappeared outside the door, the old lady let out a long sigh. Her family was unfortunate! ”

Feng Ying came to Tina’s residential area and told Tina the good news.

“Hearing this, Tina was also very excited. “Did your grandmother really say that?” ”

“”Of course.”Feng Ying nodded. “I am my grandmother’s only granddaughter. If my grandmother didn’t leave anything to me, who else could she have left it to?” ”

She had long known that she would definitely not return empty-handed this time!

“After all, she was the only bloodline that the old lady left in this world! ”

“”Miss Feng, when we go back this time, Dr. Cara will definitely reward you well!” ”

“Feng Ying smiled and said, “It doesn’t matter whether you reward me or not. I just hope that Dr. Cara will not forget what she promised me in the beginning.” ”

Dr. Cara promised her the position of deputy director of the International Fashion Department.

“”Don’t worry about that.”Tina smiled and said, “Dr. Cara has always kept her word. She will never go back on her words. Since she has promised you, she will definitely do it.” ”

“”That’s good.”Feng Ying continued, “I will come to meet you immediately after I get the Jade Tomorrow.” ”

“Okay.”Tina nodded.

“After Feng Ying left, Tina reported this matter to Dr. Cara. ”

Dr. Cara was also very excited.

He had a feeling that the jade would definitely bring him an unexpected surprise to C Nation’s science and Technology Industry!

“In the blink of an eye, the next day arrived. ”

“To celebrate Feng Ying’s birthday, the old lady had people buy a lot of props to decorate the living room. ”

“When Feng Ying arrived home at night, she saw the words “Happy Birthday”on the wall of the living room and the balloons floating on the roof. ”

“The old lady sat on the sofa and said with a smile, “Happy Birthday, Xiao Ying.” ”

“”Grandma, thank you.”Feng Ying walked over and hugged the old lady. ”

“The old lady sighed and said, “Time flies! I remember when your mother gave you to me, you were just a little old. In the blink of an eye, you are already a big girl!” ”

“Feng ying sobbed and said, “Grandma, thank you. Thank you for raising me since I was young. Don’t worry, I will definitely take good care of you in the future.” ”

“”Okay.”The old lady nodded. “I believe in you. Okay, let’s go eat first. Today, I asked Auntie Wu to prepare all the dishes that you loved to eat when you were young.” ”

“Okay.”

The grandfather and grandson walked to the dining room.

The dishes were still on the thermostat in the kitchen.

“Feng Ying raised her voice and said, “Auntie Wu, quickly bring the dishes out. We’re ready to eat.” ”

“”Auntie Wu isn’t here. I’ll go and bring the dishes out,”the old lady said lightly. ”

Feng Ying was stunned. “Where did Auntie Wu Go?”

“The old lady continued, “It’s your birthday today. There are only the two of us at home. I told Auntie Wu to leave work early. Let’s have a good talk. With an outsider here, what’s going on?” ”

“”I see.”Feng Ying smiled and said, “Then I’ll go serve the dishes! You can rest for a while.” ”

“”No need, I’ll go with you,”the old lady said. ”

The grandfather and grandson came to the kitchen to serve the dishes.

“Soon, the dining table was filled with dishes. ”

They were all Feng Ying’s favorites.

“And this.”The old lady brought a bowl of cooked noodles from the kitchen and opened the lid. “Eat the longevity noodles first.”

“Although it was called longevity noodles, it was actually a bowl of instant noodles. ”

In the middle was a poached egg and a ham sausage.

This scene made Feng Ying Cry.

“She remembered that when she was young, she was greedy and wanted to eat instant noodles when she saw other children eating it. However, Feng Qi disliked the fact that instant noodles were junk food and refused to let her eat it. Therefore, the old lady would cook a bowl of instant noodles, i’ll make a bowl of instant noodles. ”

“Therefore, Feng Ying also most look forward to the birthday time. ”

Ten years!

Ten years!

“Even she herself had forgotten her original hobby, but the old lady remembered it. ”
