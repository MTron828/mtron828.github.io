“Cen Yuyan patted song Chenyu’s hand. “Chenyu, it’s not your fault.””

“Zhou Xiaowan nodded as well. “Yuyan is right. This has nothing to do with you. If It’s our fault, it’s also our fault. We were too careless.””

The two of them were the ones who proposed the game. How could they blame song Chenyu?

“At this moment, the ones who felt the most guilty were Cen Yuyan and Zhou Xiaowan.”

“They had originally wanted to help song Chenyu make a name for himself, but who would have thought that it would be snatched away by Ye Zhuo in the end!”

“Cen Yuyan looked at song Chenyu. “Chenyu, aren’t you a little off today?””

Song Chenyu’s go skills were very good. Cen Yuyan had once played against her.

“If it wasn’t for the fact that he was off, song Chenyu wouldn’t have lost to Ye Zhuo.”

“Song Chenyu nodded. “I ran through a whole day of work yesterday. I did feel a little uncomfortable when I woke up this morning. However, this is not a reason for me to lose to Miss Ye. Miss Ye’s chess skills are indeed superb.””

A smart person would never find a reason for his own failure.

“Cen Yuyan frowned. “Chenyu, why didn’t you tell me earlier that you were uncomfortable? If you had told me earlier, I definitely wouldn’t have let ye Zao compete with you! Ye Zao’s victory was unfair!””

What was there for ye Zao to be proud of.

“If song Chenyu wasn’t feeling well, would ye Zao have won?”

Cen Yuyan was very angry!

“”Forget it.”Song Chenyu’s eyes were gentle as he smiled and said, “A win is a win. Just like in a world competition, the judges won’t rejudge the results of the competition just because the participants are sick.””

All competitions were fair.

“However, this competition was extremely unfair to Song Chenyu.”

“At this moment, the more generous song Chenyu was, the more hatred she could draw for ye Zao.”

“After all, she was sick.”

Ye Zao was perfectly normal.

It was unfair for a normal person to compete with a sick person.

“Zhou Xiaowan sighed. “Chenyu, you’re too easy to talk to! Look at how smug ye Zao is! She really thought that she won you with her strength!””

“Ever since ye Zao won against Song Chenyu, the smile on Old Madam Cen’s face had not disappeared.”

“If song Chenyu had won, Old Madam Cen would definitely have seen song Chenyu in a different light.”

Unfortunately.

“In the end, ye Zao still got the upper hand.”

“”Forget it, forget it.”Song Chenyu was not angry at all. “Harmony begets wealth.”” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Cen Yuyan looked at song Chenyu, she said somewhat resentfully, “Chenyu, why are you so Buddhist? Can’t you fight over a gun? You were the one who knew my fifth brother First! If you were half as scheming as ye Zao, my fifth brother wouldn’t have been snatched away by ye Zao!””

Song Chenyu had known Cen Shaoqing for three years.

How Long had ye Zao known Cen Shaoqing?

“Song Chenyu maintained her smile. “Some things are fated. I believe in fate. Others can’t snatch what’s mine, and I can’t snatch what’s Not Mine.””

Ye Zao’s victory was only temporary.

Did she think that she could snatch Cen Shaoqing away from her?

It was impossible!

“To Cen Shaoqing, Ye Zao was just a teenage girl.”

He and ye Zao were just playing around.

“When Cen Shaoqing was tired of playing around, he naturally wouldn’t bother with ye Zao anymore.”

Ye Zao wanted to marry him and become the Cen family’s mistress in one leap?

It was simply difficult to climb to the sky!

Although Old Mrs. Cen liked ye Zao very much and had already regarded ye Zao as the Cen family’s granddaughter-in-law from the bottom of her heart.

But who could guarantee how long this kind of affection could last?

“Moreover, old Mrs. Cen was already so old. Who knew which would come first, tomorrow or an accident?”

“If something happened to old Mrs. Cen, what kind of backing would ye Zao have in the Cen Family?”

“Therefore, song Chenyu was not worried at all.”

She was waiting for the day that ye Zao was abandoned by Cen Shaoqing.

She also believed that there would definitely be such a day.

“Seeing song Chenyu like this, Cen Yuyan sighed. “What do you mean you can’t take it away? Don’t you see that ye Zao has already snatched away my fifth brother? Chenyu, can’t you do better?””

“That’s it.”Song Chenyu patted Cen Yuyan’s hand.

“After saying that, song chenyu continued, “Oh right, Yuyan, can you lend me your phone?””

“Sure.”Cen Yuyan nodded and unlocked her phone to hand it to song Chenyu.

Song Chenyu took the phone and opened wechat. He found ye Zao from his friends list and opened her moments.

Song Chenyu originally wanted to understand ye Zao through his moments.

She didn’t expect...

She didn’t expect ye Zhuo’s moments to be closed to Cen Yuyan!

Cen Yuyan was Cen Shaoqing’s fourth sister.

Wasn’t ye Zhuo doing this to slap Cen Yuyan in the face?
