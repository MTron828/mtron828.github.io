This...

The Great Elder and the National Master were also confused.

They still didn’t know what had happened.

“They had strengthened CEN Haifeng’s forbidden technique according to the forbidden technique method, but why could CEN Haifeng still remember those things? ”

“At this moment, the great elder seemed to remember something and turned to look at the National Master. “Could it be that someone from the forbidden technique clan disobeyed our order and took the initiative to lift the forbidden technique for the General Alliance?” ”

“”I don’t think so,”the national master replied. ”

“Duanmu Huang Fei continued, “If not, how did the main alliance think of that? Could it be that there’s a second clan in the northwestern region that can lift the Forbidden Arts? Or could it be that you two did something to it?” Duanmu Huang Fei’s tone became heavier. ”

“The National Master and the Great Elder immediately stood up. “Madam, please understand that we would never do such a thing!” ”

“”But now that it has happened,”Duanmu Huangfei pressed his temples and said, “Please think about how to solve it.” ”

How to solve it?

“Since the founding of the General Alliance, there had never been such a situation. This was the first time! ”

They didn’t know how to deal with it!

“After all, Cen Haifeng was the leader of the General Alliance. How could they stop him? ”

“Madam! Madam!”The maid rushed in. “Something bad happened!”

“What’s Wrong?”Duanmu huangfei looked up and asked.

“The maid wiped the cold sweat off her face and said, “The General Alliance, the General Alliance, and the General Alliance fainted outside! They are being sent to the Central Hospital Now!” ”

“Fainted?”Duanmu huangfei heaved a sigh of relief when he heard that.

“”Yes,”the maid said. “The hospital sent someone to tell them.” ”

“The great elder continued, “Madam, let’s go and take a look.” ”

“Okay.”Duanmu huangfei nodded.

The few of them rushed to the hospital together.

“Soon, they arrived at the Central Hospital. ”

Cen Haifeng was lying on the hospital bed and wearing oxygen.

Duanmu Huangfei looked for the doctor to understand the situation.

“”Madam, don’t worry. The chief alliance fainted suddenly. It might have been a temporary shock. It’s nothing serious. They’ll wake up after two days of rest.” ”

“Thank you.”

“You’re too kind.”

The National Master and the Great Elder were guarding the ward. Duanmu huangfei walked over and told the National Master and the Great Elder exactly what the Doctor had said.

“Please think of a way. I don’t want the old matter of the Chief Alliance to be brought up again in two days!”Duanmu huangfei said.

The only way to solve the problem now was to let Cen Haifeng forget about those things again.

They absolutely could not let Cen Haifeng annul their marriage.

They also could not let Cen Haifeng think of Zhou Xiang.

She could do a lot of things in two days.

“This time, she must get rid of the future trouble forever. She absolutely would not leave any threat to herself. ”

Absolutely Not!

“As she thought of this, a vicious look appeared in Duanmu Huang Fei’s eyes. ”

“Hearing this, the national advisor immediately said, “Madam, don’t worry. This matter was caused by the two of us. We will definitely resolve this matter and definitely won’t trouble madam!” ”

“Elder da Zhang nodded and echoed, “National Advisor is right. Madam, don’t worry. We will definitely find out the reason why the General Alliance recovered their memories and give madam an explanation.” ”

“I’m relieved to have the two of you saying that.”Duanmu huangfei nodded.

...

On the other side.

At the CEN residence.

Today was the day that Cen Shaoqing returned.

Old Madam Cen specially instructed the chef to prepare a lot of food and waited for him to come back for dinner.

“Although she usually despised Cen Shaoqing, he had been gone for so long that old madam Cen still missed him. ”

11:30 pm.

“Cen couldn’t sit still any longer, so she walked to the door and waited. ”

“At this moment, the sound of a bicycle engine suddenly appeared in the air. ”

Cen’s eyes lit up.

It must be Cen Shaoqing’s car.

“Sure enough, two minutes later, she saw the familiar Maybach. ”

“A few seconds later, the Maybach stopped, the door opened, and a tall figure walked out. ”

It was Cen Shaoqing.

“Old Mrs. Cen immediately went up to him and asked with a smile, “How was it? Did It go well?” ”

“”It went quite well,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

Old Mrs. Cen held Cen Shaoqing’s hand and looked up and down. “Why do I feel like you’ve lost weight?”

“”You’re mistaken,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

“”Is that so?”Old Mrs. Cen rubbed her eyes and continued, “You sent the leaf back?” ”

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads and nodded slightly.

“Old Mrs. Cen smiled and said, “After so many days, your father-in-law and mother-in-law must have missed her too! Come, let’s go back and eat!” ”
