Translator: 549690339

“Sun Guixiang reached out and grabbed Li Hang’s arm. “Hang Hang, help Auntie say a few words.””

“In Sun Guixiang’s eyes, Li Hang had always been a sensible and sensible child, and she had always been very good to him.”

“Logically speaking, children should not be involved in matters between adults.”

“Therefore, Li Hang would more or less help her say a few words.”

“Who knew that what happened next was completely out of Sun Guixiang’s expectations. Li hang directly brushed Sun Guixiang’s hand away and continued to speak, “Aunt, when my mother divorced, do you still remember what you and Uncle Said and did? Now, you’re here to pretend to be a good person. It’s nothing more than seeing my mother look for uncle Wang.””

“Speaking up to this point, Li hang continued, “In the past, I never knew what it meant to be cold in the world, but now I do. My mother is right. From now on, Let’s go our separate ways!””

What did the rich people fear the most?

They were most afraid of the best relatives who would pester them to death.

“Rather than dragging their feet with them, it was better to cut them off completely.”

“After all, apart from dragging their feet, poor relatives knew nothing else.”

“Sun Guixiang stared at Li Hang with her eyes wide open. “Hang Hang, how can you speak like this?”She never expected that Li Hang would turn out like this.”

It was a little chilling.

“”That’s all.”Li hang continued, “My mother has already said what she should say. Please have some self-respect.””

Sun Guixiang’s face was a little pale.

“”Mom, let’s go.”Li hang held Zhou Cuihua’s arm and turned to leave.”

Sun Guixiang was about to catch up when her arm was suddenly grabbed by someone.

Sun Guixiang turned around and saw that the person who grabbed her was none other than Zhou Xiatian.

“Old Zhou.”

Zhou Xiatian’s expression was a little ugly. “I heard what you said. This mother and daughter have no conscience anymore. Let’s pretend that we don’t have such relatives in the future.”

“Sun guixiang said, “But she’s still your sister.””

“”I don’t have such a sister.”This time, Zhou Xiatian was really angry.”

He had been running around for Zhou Cuihua’s matter. He had been so worried that he had gotten such an outcome.

“”In the future, whether they live or Die has nothing to do with us.””

“Sun Guixiang looked at Zhou Xiatian and continued, “Old Zhou, are you talking in anger?””

“”I’m not talking in anger,”Zhou Xiatian said seriously.”

“Then are we really not going to chase after them?”Sun Guixiang asked.

“No.”

Zhou Xiatian’s attitude was very firm.

“Sun guixiang continued, “But looking at your sister, she seems to have really found some great backer. Do you see what she’s wearing today? It can adjust the temperature!””

“The technology that could adjust the temperature was popular all over the world, but ordinary people who wanted to buy an air-conditioned shirt had to order it half a year in advance.”

“Not only did Zhou cuihua wear it, even Li Hang wore one.”

“”It doesn’t matter whether she found a backer or not. I don’t want to rely on anyone either!”Although his current life was not too rich, it was still passable.”

“Hearing this, Sun Guixiang smiled and said, “Since you have said so, what else can I say! Let’s go back.””

“Okay.”Zhou Xiatian nodded and followed Sun Guixiang’s footsteps.

Over here.

“After Li Hang moved his household registration out, Li Dalong’s heart had been empty.”

He felt that something was missing.

“Feng Juan made him a cup of tea and said with a smile, “Dalong, I have already hung up my house. If you think it’s okay, we can choose an address and start a business in the supermarket.””

“So Fast?”Dalong looked at Feng Juan in surprise.

“”Some things need to be cut to the chase,”Feng Juan said.”

“Dalong continued, “Aren’t you afraid that I’ll lie to You?””

“Feng Juan looked at Dalong, “From the moment I saw you, I knew that you weren’t a liar. That’s why I trusted you so much. I’ve been divorced for three years, and I’ve never been so eager to have a home and a cute child.””

“In fact, Li Hang’s insistence on moving out of the household registration was a good thing for Feng Juan.” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“After all, Li Dalong wasn’t going to have another child in the first place.”

“Although Feng Juan didn’t object to this, as a woman, she was always eager to have a child with the person she liked.”

How could other people’s children have their own relatives?

“Feng Juan’s words made Li Dalong see endless hope. His heart moved, and he continued, “Juan ‘er, let’s Go get the certificate!””

“Now?”Feng Juan was stunned.

Li Dalong nodded. “Now.”
