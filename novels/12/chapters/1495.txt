Illusion?

“Jin Yuyan was lying on the chair of a noble lady, applying a facial mask. Beside her were two masseurs massaging her.”

“At this moment, her phone rang in the air.”

“At this moment, Jin Yuyan heard her phone ring. She frowned. “Just hang up!””

“Looking at the caller ID, her assistant looked a little troubled. “Princess, Princess, it’s secretary Zhou Calling.””

Secretary Zhou was Empress Korea’s personal secretary.

“Hearing this, Jin Yuyan immediately took off the mask on her face, stood up, took the phone, and said respectfully, “Secretary Zhou!””

“Secretary Zhou’s voice came from the other end of the phone. “Eldest princess, the Empress has given you until tomorrow to rush back to the country immediately!””

So Urgent?

“Jin Yuyan narrowed her eyes and continued, “Secretary Zhou, did my mother say what it was about?””

“”I’m not too sure about the details. Anyway, please come back quickly!””

“After saying that, Secretary Zhou hung up the phone.”

“Looking at the phone that was hung up, Jin Yuyan’s face was full of confusion.”

Why did her mother call her back so urgently?

Could it be that it was because Korea was in the top three in the shooting competition and she wanted to reward her?

“Otherwise, Jin Yuyan really could not find a reason for her mother to ask her to go back quickly.”

Jin Yuyan was unwilling to let Jin Yuyan go back now.

“After all, she still had important things to do.”

“At this moment, her cell phone rang again.” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Who called?”Jin Yuyan asked.

“The assistant looked at the cell phone and said, “It’s secretary Zhang.””

Secretary Zhang must have called because of Ye Zhuo.

Scarface must have succeeded!

“Thinking of this, Jin Yuyan curled her lips.”

Fighting with her!

It was ridiculous!

“Hello.”Jin Yuyan picked up the phone.

“She did not know what secretary Zhang said, but Jin Yuyan’s expression changed. “How could this be!””

She had failed!

She had actually failed again!

Jin Yuyan wanted to throw her phone away. “Trash!”

“A moment later, Jin Yuyan continued, “The Empress called and asked me to go back first. You should continue to stay here and make sure to get rid of ye Zao! Otherwise, don’t come back!””

“After saying that, Jin Yuyan directly hung up the phone.”

A bunch of trash!

They couldn’t even deal with a little girl.

“Seeing her like this, the assistant who had been following Jin Yuyan all this while walked over. “Eldest princess.””

“Speak.”

“The assistant continued, “This ye Zhuo seems to be different from what we’ve investigated. Why don’t we let her off the hook? We don’t want to get into trouble!””

“What a joke! Don’t Tell Me I’m afraid of a little girl!”

Jin Yuyan had never been afraid of anyone in her life.

The assistant immediately shut up!

“Jin Yuyan continued, “Go and book a plane ticket. Get to Lille Airport before noon tomorrow.””

Lille was the name of the capital city of Korea.

“Yes.”The assistant bent down to book a plane ticket.

On the other side.

“At 10:30, Ye Zhuo arrived at the hotel from Chinatown.”

Carl was the one who sent her back.

“”What time is the flight tomorrow? I’ll send you back,”Carl said.”

“”At 2:00 p.m. ,”ye Zhuo answered.”

“Carl continued, “Then I’ll wait for you downstairs at 12:00 p.m.””

“Sure.”Ye Zao nodded slightly. “I’ll go in first.”

“Okay.”Carl nodded and watched ye Zao go in.

Ye Zao had just walked into the hotel lobby when he was stopped by someone. “Miss Ye!”

Ye Zao looked back slightly and saw a gentle-looking young woman.

“After a while, ye Zao finally remembered who this was.”

Chen Siyan.

They had met once at Old Madam Song’s funeral.

“”Miss Chen,”ye Zao greeted politely.”

“Chen Siyan walked over with a smile. “Miss Ye, what a coincidence. I didn’t expect to meet you here.””

“C nation was very big. Although there were many Chinese people doing business here, it was still quite difficult to meet an acquaintance.”

“”It’s quite a coincidence,”ye Zao said.”

“Chen Siyan continued, “Miss Ye, are you here for a vacation?”Ye Zao was young and a university student. Apart from traveling, he seemed to have nothing else to do.”

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly. “There are also some other things.”

“”OH.”Chen siyan continued, “By the way, I’m staying in Room A056. If Miss Ye is free, you can come and chat with me.””

“Ye Zao smiled and nodded. “Okay, but I have to go back tomorrow.””

“So Soon?”Chen Siyan was a little surprised.

Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“Just then, Xia Wei walked over and called Chen siyan, “Miss!””
