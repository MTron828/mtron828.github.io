Elder Zhang was extremely excited.

Although he didn’t know whether the matriarch of the Lin family that Cao Wei mentioned was half a month old or not.

But it was better to give it a try than to sit and wait for death.

“Besides, Cao Wei wasn’t a careless person. ”

He definitely had about 80% confidence in telling him about this matter!

“Cao Wei nodded. “Alright Elder, then I’ll go to Beijing University to look for Miss Lin Now.” ”

“You go quickly.”Elder Zhang nodded.

Cao Wei turned and walked out the door.

“Elder Zhang stood up and said, “I’ll go with you!”He could not wait any longer. He just wanted to find Miss Lin immediately and settle ye Langhua’s matter. ”

He could not just watch Xi Weiyue become elder Ye’s heir!

...

On the other side.

“After Auntie Lang handed the recommendation letter to Elder Zhang, she returned to the Xi family home. ”

“”Mother, you’ve already sent the recommendation letter?”Jiang Yan immediately went up to greet Auntie Lang when she saw her return. ”

Auntie Lang nodded. “I’ve sent it over.”

“Jiang Yan continued, “Then, let’s go tell sister Weiyue about this right now! She’ll definitely be very happy!” ” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“MMM.”

Xi Weiyue was discussing a plan with XI Muwen in the study upstairs.

“When they heard the knock on the door, Xi Weiyue and XI Muwen looked at each other before walking over to open the door. “Auntie, Sister Half Moon, why are you here?” ”

“Jiang Yan held Xi Weiyue’s hand intimately. “Weiyue, I have good news for you.” ”

“What Good News?”Xi Weiyue pretended to know nothing.

“Jiang Yan continued, “Haven’t you always wanted to join the Shunxi Financial Group in the financial world?” ”

“Xi Weiyue was a little embarrassed when she heard this. “The Shunxi Financial Group’s threshold is too high. How can a person like me, who is uneducated and uneducated, enter just like that?” ”

“Jiang Yan smiled. “Weiyue, you’re too modest! If you’re uneducated and uneducated, then what am I? To tell you the truth, I haven’t even graduated from elementary school...” ”

“Hearing this, Aunt Lang’s heart was filled with guilt. ”

“If she hadn’t lost little half moon back then, if Little Half Moon had grown up by her side, she definitely wouldn’t be like this now. ”

Poor child.

“Xi Weiyue held Jiang Yan’s hand and said, “Sister Half Moon, your genes are good. You have to know that aunt was a famous talented girl back then. Even if you haven’t studied before, you’re still better than me. Unlike me, who went to school and received higher education but still can’t even get into the Shunxi financial group like this.” ”

“”Who said you can’t get in! You’ll be able to join the Shunxi Financial Group soon!”Jiang Yan continued, “My mother wrote you a recommendation letter and recommended you to be my grandfather’s successor! Oh, no, it should be our grandfather!” ”

“Really?”Xi Weiyue looked at Auntie Lang in surprise.

“Auntie lang nodded, “It’s true.” ”

“Xi Muwen was also surprised, “Lang Hua, so father really has a relationship with the Shunxi Financial Group?” ”

“Aunt Lang said, “My dad was one of the founders of the Shunxi Financial Group. He was also the Elder in charge of the Shunxi Financial Group. After he was lost for half a month, my dad left the Shunxi Financial Group. According to them, the family in charge of the Shunxi Financial Group is the Zhao family now.” ”

“”I never knew about these things!”Xi Muwen’s acting was very good. If those who did not know saw it, they would think that he really did not know. ”

“Aunt Lang looked up at Xi Weiyue. “Weiyue, you’re a smart and talented child. After joining Shunxi Financial Group, you must continue to work hard. Don’t embarrass the old man.” ”

“Xi Weiyue nodded solemnly. “Thank you for your love, Aunt. I definitely won’t let you down.” ”

“Xi Muwen pretended to frown, then, he said, “Lang Hua, actually Weiyue just wants to join Shunxi Financial Group. You Don’t have to let her become the old man’s heir. After all, half a month is the old man’s heir. These things should be left to half a month.” ”

“Xi Weiyue nodded in agreement. “Aunty, my father is right! I really don’t deserve the position of successor. I’m very grateful that you gave me a chance to join the Financial Group.” ”

“Hearing that.., jiang Yan hurriedly said, “Weiyue, father! Don’t say that. I don’t even know a few words. I won’t even know how to handle the matters in the financial group! “How can I be qualified to be the successor? “I think it’s best to let Wei Yue be grandfather’s successor! “If I go to the consortium, won’t I be a joke to others? “Anyway, we’re all one family, so we won’t let others get away with it!” ”

“After saying that, Jiang Yan turned to Aunt Lang. “Mom, do you think I’m right?” ”
