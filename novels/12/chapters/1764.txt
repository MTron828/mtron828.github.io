The distance between their offices was not very far. They arrived in less than two steps.

“Through a transparent screen, they could see that ye Zao was looking down at his phone. ”

Cen Shaoqing bent his fingers and knocked on the door.

“Come in.”Ye Zao’s voice came from inside.

Cen Shaoqing’s slender fingers held the doorknob and pushed the door open. “Leader.”

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo looked back slightly.

“Are you okay?”Cen Shaoqing walked over.

“I’m fine.”Ye Zhuo shook his head slightly.

It was good that he was fine!

“Although Cen Shaoqing knew that ye Zhuo would not be affected by the comments online, he still could not help but worry. “I’ll get someone to bring my computer over.” ”

“Bring my computer over for what?”Ye Zhuo was a little puzzled.

“”I’ll work with you.”CEN Shaoqing continued, “Leave the rest to me. You Don’t have to worry about it.” ”

Ye Zao chuckled and nodded slightly. “Okay.”

“In a flash, the assistant brought Cen Shaoqing’s computer over. ”

The two of them were working in the same office. The air was filled with the sound of typing.

Cen Shaoqing looked up at Ye Zao from time to time. It was quiet and beautiful.

“At this moment, Cen Shaoqing received a pop-up message. ”

[ master five! I found everything! [ video ][ video ][ video ][ video ]

Cen Shaoqing opened the videos one by one and sent a message to the other party: [ do you know what to do? ]

“[ master five, don’t Worry! ] ”

“Just as the internet trolls were leading the masses who did not know the truth, the police released a video. ”

This was the last video that Feng Shujing recorded before she died.

“The old man stood in front of the camera, dressed neatly, “My Name Is Feng Shujing. I was born in 1932. Feng Qi is my daughter, and Feng Ying is my granddaughter. In the past, I also had a filial daughter and a cute granddaughter. But at some point, everything changed. “My daughter became unlike my daughter, and my granddaughter became unlike my granddaughter. “I was a failure as a mother and a grandmother.” ” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“...”

“”But when I found out that Feng Qi had defected, I was completely dumbfounded. I felt as if the sky had collapsed. It was because I hadn’t taught my daughter well that she had embarked on a path of no return. It was Feng Qi’s retribution to die on an alien planet. However, at that time, I didn’t know that Feng Qi’s betrayal was only the beginning. Because later on, my granddaughter, who was also Feng Qi’s daughter, also embarked on this path... ... Feng Ying had been abroad for many years. Before that, I hadn’t seen her for several decades ... half a month ago, she suddenly returned to China and promised me that she would never leave China and would never leave me “At that time, I was really happy. I was old, and I wanted someone to be by my side the most. Feng Ying was the granddaughter that I raised with my own hands. Although we haven’t seen each other for decades, the love between us is still there ”

“”After Feng Ying returned, I did have a happy time. Now that I think about it, I really miss her. “All the good things ended on October 9th. “This morning, as usual, I was watering the flowers in the garden. When I returned home, I happened to hear Feng Ying talking to someone named Tina. The recording of their conversation is as follows.” ”

The old lady faced the camera and played the recording she recorded that day.

“After the recording was played, the old lady faced the camera again. She opened the lid of the wooden box and took out a piece of jade. ”

“”This piece of jade is the plain jade that they were talking about. The plain jade is the inheritance jade of our Feng family. It has been passed down from my great-grandfather for more than a hundred years. Tina is a member of the scientific research community in C Nation. She asked Feng Ying to come back and steal the plain jade from me. There must be an unspeakable secret! So, I decided to hand over the plain jade to Miss Ye, Dr. YC, for safekeeping. As for Feng Ying, she is my granddaughter. I have an inescapable responsibility for not teaching my daughter and granddaughter well! Please rest assured, I will definitely give Miss Ye and the people an explanation.” ”
