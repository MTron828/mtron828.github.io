Zhou Ziyue naturally couldn’t accept the sudden decision.

She and Feng Yang were true love.

The two of them had experienced misunderstandings and witnessed each other’s growth together. She didn’t want to break up with Feng Yang just like that.

“”Mom, can you let me think about it?”Zhou Ziyue asked. ”

“”I’m up to you,”ye Sui continued, “As long as you don’t regret it.” ”

“After saying that, ye Sui said, “I’m going to take a shower.” ”

“After saying that, ye Sui turned around and entered the house. ”

“Although it was a guest room, it was more luxurious than a five-star hotel. Even the bathroom amazed ye Sui. ”

Ye Shu was really rich. Even the guest room at home was so good.

When would she be able to live in a house like this?

She would ask ye Shu to buy her a villa in Beijing!

“Ye Shu was so rich now. She had servants, butlers, and drivers. Buying a villa was nothing to her! ”

“Ye Sui lay in the bathtub, already planning for the future. ”

On the other side.

Zhou Ziyue washed up and sat on the sofa in a daze.

“At this moment, her phone suddenly rang. ”

It was a video call from Feng Yang.

“Zhou Ziyue was very upset, but when she picked up the video call from Feng Yang, she still smiled. “Feng Yang.” ”

Feng Yang and Zhou Ziyue were classmates. He was about 1.8 meters tall and handsome. He was very eye-catching among the crowd.

“Comparatively, Zhou Ziyue was slightly worse than Feng Yang. That was because Zhou Ziyue would often ask him why he liked her. After all, when she was in school, many of her seniors and juniors had chased after Feng Yang, but Feng Yang had never changed his mind. ”

Feng Yang would always answer that love had nothing to do with looks.

“He liked Zhou Ziyue, not her face. ”

“Every time she heard this answer, Zhou Ziyue would be very touched. ”

“”Ziyue, are you here?”Feng Yang asked with concern. ”

Zhou Ziyue nodded. “I’m here.”

“Where’s Auntie?”Feng Yang asked.

“Zhou ziyue said, “My mom is washing up.” ”

“After saying that, Zhou ziyue continued, “How was your interview today?” ”

“”Pretty good.”Feng yang smiled and said, “Don’t you have any confidence in me?” ”

“”Yes, yes, yes.”Zhou ziyue continued, “Have you eaten?” ”

“”I just ate.”Feng Yang nodded as if he had thought of something. “By the way, I’m preparing to pay the down payment. Do you think it’s okay to go to the residential area we saw last time?” ”

“Half a month ago, Zhou Ziyue and Feng Yang went to see a house together. ”

“It was a three-bedroom, one-living area. The environment of the residential area was not bad in all aspects. The total price was 2 million. Feng Yang could pay 1.2 million down payment and the remaining 800,000 in loans. ”

“Half a month ago, when Zhou Ziyue and Feng Yang went to see a house, they were full of confidence in their lives and future. ”

But now...

Zhou Ziyue suddenly didn’t know how to reply to Feng Yang.

“Seeing that she was absent-minded, Feng Yang said, “Ziyue, what’s Wrong?” ”

“Zhou Ziyue finally reacted and said with a smile, “It’s nothing. Have you brought Auntie to the neighborhood to look at the Environment? What did she say?” ”

“”She said that as long as you like it, it’s fine,”Feng Yang said. “Anyway, we’ll be staying here in the future. My parents have a house.” ”

“Zhou Ziyue was stunned for a moment and then said, “Then let’s Wait a little longer. I’m a little busy here. Can we talk about it when I come back?” ”

“Sure.”Feng Yang nodded.

The two of them talked about something else before hanging up.

Ye Sui walked in from the door. “You just talked to Feng Yang on the phone?”

“Yeah.”Zhou Ziyue nodded.

“Have you told him clearly?”Ye Sui asked. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“”Not yet,”Zhou ziyue continued, “Mom, I...” ”

“Ye Sui shook his head. “Forget it, forget it. I’m too lazy to care about your business! Anyway, if you want to break it, break it early. Don’t drag it out. It’ll make everyone uncomfortable.” ”

Zhou Ziyue still didn’t say anything.

“Ye Sui looked at Zhou Ziyue, his face full of resentment. ”

“”Mom, I’ve been with Feng Yang for almost ten years. Please don’t force me. Can you give me some time?”From the first time they met until now, these feelings were not fake. Zhou Ziyue was not a god, so she could not bear to part with them. ”

“Ye Sui said, “Did I force you? Anyway, I won’t bother you anymore!” ”

“Mom...”

Du Du —

“At this moment, there was a knock on the door. ”

Ye Sui immediately adjusted his expression and went to open the door.

“”Hello, do you need to eat now?”The Butler stood outside the door and asked. ”

“Ye Sui smiled and said, “I’m just hungry. Bring it up now.” ”

“The butler nodded. “Okay, please wait a moment.” ”
