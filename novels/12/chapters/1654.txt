“No one knew what was said on the other end, but Anthony’s face immediately turned pale, and the strength in his body seemed to be sucked away in an instant. He hurriedly said, “Okay! I’ll do it right away!” ”

“Even after hanging up the phone, Anthony still looked like he was in a daze. ”

“Professor Cara frowned slightly, and asked in puzzlement, “What did Mr. Chairman Tell You?” ”

“Anthony said with a pale face, “It’s over! It’s over! Didn’t you say that YC has no background? Now I’m going to be screwed by you!” ”

“Hearing this, professor Cara’s heart skipped a beat. “What’s going on? Does Mr. President Know About This?” ”

“Anthony continued, “Not only did he know, but Mr. President also told me that if I didn’t handle this matter properly, he would remove me from my post!”! I advise you to quickly apologize to the people sent by China and then issue a statement to clarify the facts to make Dr. YC satisfied!” ”

What?

Dr. Cara was stunned.

Let him apologize to the people from China? And let him issue a statement to clarify the facts?

Then what was all that he had done before?

Wasn’t he just slapping himself in the face?

No!

He couldn’t do that!

Dr. Cara stood up from his chair. “What is the number of the President’s phone number? I want to ask him personally!”He didn’t believe that the president would stand on Ye Zao’s side!

“Anthony looked at Dr. Cara, then handed the phone to him. ”

The call was quickly connected.

“Dr. Cara couldn’t wait to get through. “Mr. President, this is Cara...” ”

Click!

“Before Cara could finish his sentence, his phone fell to the ground. It was as if all his strength had been sucked out at that moment. ”

He had never expected that the president would actually stand on Ye Zao’s side!

Then what about his base?

He had devoted his whole life to the base and poured his heart and soul into it. could he just hand it over to someone like that?

No!

He was not resigned!

Dr. Cara was truly unwilling to lose to a young girl who was only in her early twenties.

What was the background of this ye Zao?

Why did he make the chairman so fearful?

“But now, no matter how unwilling Dr. Cara was, she could only carry out the orders of the chairman! ”

Anthony immediately issued a new statement on behalf of the notary office.

Dr. Cara’s side also issued a new statement.

“The two statements exploded, and the onlookers were dumbfounded. ”

Especially those who supported Dr. Cara.

Who would have thought that Dr. Cara would jump out and slap himself in the face?

Then what were they?

“After all, they trusted Dr. Cara so much that in Dr. Cara’s previous statement, they fiercely scolded ye Zhuo and the others, and even accused ye Zhuo and China of theft and despicable behavior! ”

Those Chinese people who supported Dr. Cara instantly felt like they had eaten a pile of shit.

“Therefore, those who had scolded ye Zao before pointed their fingers at Dr. Cara and the others and started a fierce scolding battle online. ”

Worker Xu and the others waited from three in the afternoon to eight in the evening.

“During this period, not only did Cara not come to apologize, she didn’t even call. ”

“”I knew Kara would not come to apologize so easily!”Yang Hua stood up from his chair. “Worker Xu, why don’t we all go back and rest first!” ”

“Worker Xu nodded. “Alright, then everyone can go back and rest first.” ”

“At this moment, the doorbell rang outside the door. ”

Yang Hua walked over to open the door.

“When he saw the people standing outside the door, Yang Hua was immediately stunned! ”

“He saw that it was none other than Carla, Tina, and Gamila! ”

It was already so late. What were they doing here?

Were they really here to apologize?

“”Hello, I’m Carla Jones from C Nation.”Dr. Carla suppressed her anger and smiled. “May I know if worker Xu is here?” ”

Yang Hua finally reacted and nodded with a smile. “Yes. Please come in.”

Everyone filed in.

“Yang Hua introduced to Dr. Cara, “This is our worker Xu. Worker Xu, Dr. Cara is looking for you.” ”

Worker Xu and the others were also a little surprised to see Dr. Cara.

“”Hello, Dr. Cara. I am Xu Zhiguo.”Worker Xu walked forward and took the initiative to extend his hand to Dr. Cara. ”

“Dr. Cara held worker Xu’s hand, then he said, “Hello, worker Xu. Due to some misunderstandings, I have neglected all of you and did not allow you to enter the country. I am really sorry! “I am here to apologize to all of you along with the other people in Charge! “Please forgive me for my wrongdoings!”At the end of his sentence, dr. Cara bowed deeply to worker Xu and the others. ”
