Man Jiangshan narrowed his eyes.

What did ye Zhuo Mean Now? A discerning person could figure it out with his toes!

“From the looks of it, Ye Zhuo and ye Han must have fallen out with each other. Ye Han had plotted to usurp the throne, and Ye Zhuo had nowhere to go. That was why he had agreed to come back. ”

“In Ye Zhuo’s eyes, what was the Manxing Kingdom? ”

“When she was the monarch of Changyue kingdom, she had ignored Zhao Dan and showed her displeasure to Zhao Dan. Once she was schemed against, Ye Zhuo had thought of the Manxing Kingdom? ”

“Since that was the case, then don’t blame him for being impolite. ”

“From then on, he no longer had a daughter like ye Zhuo. ”

“”Go and tell her that it’s too late for her to come back now!”Man Jiangshan continued, “I only have two children, man Xing and Man Wen! Don’t even think about other imposters pretending to be my full moon!” ”

“Ah?”

“Seeing man Jiangshan like this, Zhao Dan was stunned for a moment. “What’s wrong? Why did this happen all of a sudden? Didn’t you say that you wanted to recognize her back? Why are you suddenly refusing to recognize her again?” ”

“Man Jiangshan continued, “Didn’t you see the changyue country’s announcement today?” ”

“What announcement?”Zhao Dan asked as he opened his browser and logged into the changyue country’s official website.

“Soon, he saw the first announcement on the top page. ”

“After reading the entire announcement, Zhao Dan’s face was a little pale. ”

Ye Zhuo had actually given up the changyue country to Ye Han.

“In other words, from today onwards, Ye Zhuo was an ordinary citizen and was no longer the ruler of the changyue country. ”

“If ye Zhuo wanted to give up, he should have given up this position to the full stars. ”

What was the meaning of giving up this position to Ye Han?

Ye Han and ye Zhuo were not related by blood at all. was he worthy?

“”How could this be!”Zhao dan frowned, “Why did she give up the feeling of being the ruler of the Changyue Kingdom to Ye Han?” ”

“Man Jiangshan continued, “Now you know why she suddenly changed her mind and agreed to come back!” ”

“At this point, man Jiangshan said with a face full of anger, “She has nowhere to go! As long as she has a way to go, she won’t think of coming back! What does she think of our Manxing Kingdom? She thinks of it as her sanctuary! She can come and go as she pleases! Why didn’t she think of coming back when she was at her peak!” ”

“Ye Zao had a high position and power. It was very easy for her to find out about her background. In fact, she already knew about her background. ”

“In order to prevent Manxing Kingdom from finding out about her, she even hid her appearance from the public. ”

“Other than the core personnel of Changyue Kingdom, who else had seen ye Zhuo’s appearance before? ”

No one had ever seen her before!

“When she was still a female monarch, she had never thought of repaying her parents. Now that she was down and out, she wanted to return home to seek refuge? ”

In her dreams!

“She was just a wild child that no one wanted, just like Manxing Kingdom ”

“With that said, Zhao Dan also understood the reasoning behind it, and came to a sudden realization. “I was wondering! Why did she suddenly change her personality! So that’s how it is! Alright, I know what to do!” ”

“Speaking up to this point, Zhao Dan sighed and said, “Sometimes, I even wonder if she is really my biological flesh and blood. Look at how understanding Xing ‘ER is. What about her? She can’t even compare to half of Xing ‘er!” ”

“If this matter was handled by Manxing, she would definitely not hand over the changyue kingdom to Ye Han. ”

Ye Zhuo simply had no conscience at all.

“Although Manwen did not do much and was a profligate silkpants, he at least had Manxing in his heart. He had parents like them. ”

What did ye Zhuo have in his heart?

Only herself!

Zhao Dan had just cut off contact when ye Han came looking for her.

“”Madam, are you ready? My sister asked me to rush you. When will you bring her back?” ”

Rush?

Ye Zhuo had nowhere to go and now he knew to rush her? RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“When she went to beg ye Zhuo, where was Ye Zhuo? ”

“Your sister? Who is your sister?”Zhao Dan raised his head to look at Ye Han.

“Ye Han was stunned, he smiled and said, “Madam, aren’t you asking the obvious? Of course my sister is your Manxing Kingdom’s missing full moon princess for many years! Didn’t you just say that you were going to bring her back? How did you forget in the blink of an eye?” ”

“”Full moon? My Full Moon died a long time ago! Do you really think that any Tom, Dick, or Harry can pretend to be my full moon!”Zhao Dan looked at Ye Han, then, he said, “Your Sister Is Ye Zhuo, right? She is the female monarch of Changyue Kingdom! We are not worthy of her!” ”

“”Madam, you are wrong to say that! At that time, you were the one who came looking for me and said that my sister is a full moon! Now You don’t admit it!”Ye Han’s face was full of anger, “What do you mean by that? Do you really think that we siblings are easy to bully?” ”

“”Nothing much, I just mistook her for someone else! Ye Zhuo has nothing to do with our Manxing Kingdom! Please tell your sister to stop daydreaming!” Zhao Dan made a ‘please’gesture. “Mr. Xiao Ye, Please!” ”
