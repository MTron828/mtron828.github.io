Chapter 1865: 271: doting on his wife as if she was his fifth master

Translator: 549690339

“If he ziteng really fell in love with someone else, wouldn’t it be all for naught? ”

No.

No.

She couldn’t let such a thing happen.

Xu Yao narrowed her eyes.

“After thinking for a while, Xu Yao continued, “But, isn’t it strange that I suddenly accepted he ziteng’s Words?” ”

It had only been a month since he ziteng confessed to her.

“She had just said that she didn’t want to fall in love for the time being, but she had turned around and accepted he ziteng. What did he ziteng think of this? ”

“Hearing this, mother Xu narrowed her eyes and said, “Then let’s have a home run. Mother, you have to make he ziteng feel guilty about you.” ”

“What do you mean?”Xu Yao turned to look at Mother Xu.

“Although Xu Yao was having fun, she was only having fun with her boyfriends. There was no real development. ”

“After a while, she found it hard to understand what mother Xu meant. ”

Mother Xu walked up to Xu Yao and whispered a few words in her ear.

“After hearing what mother Xu said, Xu Yao frowned. “Isn’t this a little embarrassing?” ”

Xu Yao was someone who had received higher education and higher etiquette.

Her upbringing made it hard for her to accept such a thing!

“Moreover, she was not the kind of person who needed to use a child to get to the top. ”

“Although she did not know if he ziteng would change his heart in the future, at least he ziteng now truly loved her. ”

“At this moment, Xu Yao was somewhat disdainful of such underhanded methods. ”

“Mother Xu was a little speechless as she said, “How is it unpresentable? How many cases of unmarried pregnancy are there now? The daughter-in-law of the Wang family is also pregnant before getting married!” ”

“Is that true?”Xu Yao asked.

“Mother Xu continued, “Yin Jie is just a bumpkin from the countryside. Other than her high education, she is completely useless. Do you think the Wang family will take a fancy to her?” ”

“Yin Jie was the eldest daughter-in-law of the Wang family. Her birth was ordinary. Because Mrs. Wang and mother Xu were poker friends, it was often heard that Mrs. Wang despised her daughter-in-law. ”

“Although the Wang family was not a top-tier wealthy family, it was not something that any ordinary family could enlighten. ”

“Yin Jie’s family had been poor for three generations. They had no background at all. If it was not because they had the blood of the Wang family, the Wang family would never have agreed to this marriage. ”

“Hearing this, Xu Yao frowned slightly and continued, “You have already said that about Yin Jie. What if others say the same thing about me after I get together with He Ziteng?” ”

“People were always like this. They could only see the flaws of others, but they ignored their own flaws. ”

“”As long as I can gain a firm foothold in the He family, what can I do even if others say a few words about me?” Mother Xu continued, “Besides, you’re different from Yin Jie! You’re the eldest daughter of the Xu family, so what’s Yin Jie to you? How can she compare to you? She can’t even compare to one of your little fingers.” ”

“When it came to Yin Jie, mother Xu’s eyes were filled with disdain, as if even mentioning it would make her feel disgusted. ”

“Xu Yao bit her lip and continued, “I, I’ll think about it again.” ”

“”Yaoyao, what else is there to think about?”When she saw Xu Yao like this, mother Xu’s eyes were filled with disappointment. She wished that she could directly take Xu Yao’s place in this matter, “By doing this, not only will you stabilize your position in the He family, but you can also make he ziteng feel guilty towards you. What’s wrong with that? Let me tell you, some things have to be done early. If you’re late, it’ll be too late!” ”

Xu Yao was still very hesitant.

She had never thought that she would use such a method to tie he ziteng down.

“Yaoyao!”

“At this moment, the sound of footsteps came from the living room. ”

“Following that was Xu Chaonan’s voice. “Sister-in-law, what are you saying to Yaoyao?” ”

“Xu Yao turned around and smiled. “Aunt, you’re back.” ”

“Mm.”Xu Yao nodded.

“Mother Xu said, “Nothing much.” ”

What kind of person was Xu Chaonan?

She wished that Xu Yao was like her and would never be able to get married.

“If Xu Chaonan knew about this, she would definitely interfere! ”

“Xu Chaonan placed the document bag on the table and continued, “I think I heard he ziteng just now. Sister-in-law, marriage is fated by nature. There are some things you can’t force. Besides, I don’t think that the he family is suitable for Yaoyao.” ”

Xu Chaonan was a down-to-earth person.

She never thought of taking shortcuts. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The Xu family was able to get to where they were today because of her hard work.

Xu Yao was quick-witted and liked to be competitive. A family like the he family needed a calm and composed daughter-in-law to take control of the overall situation.

Marriage was a matter for two people. The husband and wife needed to learn from each other’s strengths and make up for each other’s weaknesses.
