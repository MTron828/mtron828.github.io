“”You can’t do it,”Cen Shaoqing continued. ”

“Why?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“Cen Shaoqing looked around and finally said in a low voice, “It’s too thin, it’s easy to break.” ”

Ye Zhuo’s face was full of black question marks.

“She vaguely felt that there was something wrong with this sentence, but she could not figure out what exactly was wrong. ”

“Cen Shaoqing chuckled and raised his hand to Pat ye Zao’s head. “Silly girl, let’s go in.” ”

Ye Zao pinched Cen Shaoqing’s waist discontentedly.

“”Hiss...”Cen Shaoqing sucked in a breath of cold air. “Ancestor, be gentle!” ”

“”Isn’t your waist good?”Ye Zao smiled and said, “Good and afraid of Pain?” ”

“”Even a good waist can’t withstand your torment.”Cen Shaoqing’s tone was light, but his eyes were full of indulgence. “Tell me, how many times do you pinch me in a day?” ”

Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly. “You make it sound like I have a tendency to be violent.”

“”It’s me who has a tendency to be abused,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

Ye Zhuo laughed softly. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Cen Shaoqing’s EQ was simply TOO HIGH!

Such a man had actually been single for more than thirty years!

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Why did you want to be a monk in the past?” ”

“Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads, “Perhaps you feel that life is meaningless. You feel that people should not live for the sake of reproduction. If the ultimate goal of life is to marry and have children, then marry and have children, such a cycle would be too boring!” ”

“”I didn’t expect you to be a philosopher!”Ye Zhuo laughed softly and continued, “What About Now?” ”

“”Now?”Cen Shaoqing raised his eyebrows and reached out to hold ye Zao’s waist, bringing her to sit on his lap. “Now I want to have a litter of children with you.” ”

“”Shameless, who wants to have a litter of children with you!”Ye Zao directly pushed Cen Shaoqing’s face away with his hand. ”

“Then have three?”Cen Shaoqing continued.

“No.”Ye Zao shook his head.

Cen Shaoqing held her waist with one hand and the Buddhist beads with the other. “Then... two?”

“”Two?”Ye Zhuo thought for a moment. “Two is quite good. I just happen to have a companion. Otherwise, it would be too lonely to be alone!” ”

The curve of Cen Shaoqing’s lips gradually deepened.

“At this moment, ye Zhuo seemed to have suddenly thought of something and stood up from his lap. “Who wants to give birth to your child! I didn’t agree to it!” ”

“This person was really too black-bellied. If he was a little careless, he would have walked into his trap. ”

“Cen Shaoqing grabbed her hand and pulled her gently. She fell into his arms and said, “You just agreed!” ”

“”Cen Shaoqing, you...” ”

“Before ye Zhuo could finish his sentence, a person walked in from outside. Seeing this scene, he froze on the spot. After a few seconds, he immediately reacted and said, “I’m sorry, I’m sorry! I didn’t see anything!”Then, he turned around and left. ”

“This was the little du that ye Langhua had been talking about. Little Du had been in the shop for many years, and he usually got along with ye Langhua as if they were family. ”

Ye Zao blushed and reached out to pinch Cen Shaoqing’s face. “Are you embarrassed?”

“Cen Shaoqing hugged her tightly and rested his chin on his shoulder. He took a deep breath and said, “What’s there to be embarrassed about hugging your girlfriend?” ”

“You’re really thick-skinned!”Ye Zao was a little speechless.

“CEN Shaoqing said, “Grandma said that thin-skinned people can’t get a wife.” ”

PA —

“A crisp sound suddenly came from the air, and then the air fell into darkness. ”

Ye Zao looked up at the ceiling. “The lights are broken.”

Cen Shaoqing also looked up slightly. “Do you know where the toolbox is?”

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo turned on the flashlight function of his phone and stood up to get the toolbox.

Cen Shaoqing moved a chair over and placed it on the coffee table. He stood on it and tried it out. His hand was just enough to reach the light.

“At this moment, Ye Zhuo came over with the toolbox. “What do you need?” ”

Cen Shaoqing looked at the lampshade. “Give me an electric pen first.”

“”Okay.”Ye Zhuo took out an electric pen from inside, stood on the coffee table, and handed the electric pen to him. ”

“Do you need me to help you with the lighting?”Ye Zhuo continued to ask.

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

Ye Zhuo took out his phone to help Cen Shaoqing with the lighting.

“Cen Shaoqing raised his head and started to screw the screws. The light from the flashlight shone on his face, making his cold white skin look even fairer. The black hair on his forehead flitted past his eyebrows and eyes. Although he was fixing the lamp.., he exuded an aura of nobility. ”

The book was right. A man who was focused on something was the most serious.

“At this moment, a rapid ringtone broke the silence in the room. ”
