Old Lady Lin was not very good with electronic products. “Can I swipe my card?”

“Yes.”

Old Lady Lin took out a bank card from her bag.

“The receptionist took the bank card and swiped it on the swipe card machine. Then, she handed the card to Old Lady Lin. “I’m sorry, but your card has insufficient balance.” ”

Insufficient balance?

“Old Lady Lin frowned. Without thinking much, she took out another card from her bag. ”

“Ten seconds later, the receptionist continued, “I’m sorry, but your card has been frozen.” ”

Frozen?

Old Lady Lin’s heart skipped a beat.

Could it be that Lin Jin Cheng did it?

Luckily!

“Luckily, she still had a black card. ”

Old Lady Lin handed the black card to the receptionist again.

“The front desk swiped the card and said, “This card is still frozen.” ”

Old Madam Lin’s expression was extremely gloomy.

She did not expect Lin Jincheng to tamper with her bank card.

“Feng Qianxian narrowed her eyes and said in a timely manner, “Grandmother, if you don’t mind, you can come to my house and live with me.” ”

Old Madam Lin nodded.

She followed Feng Xianxian to the apartment.

“Although the apartment they rented for Feng Xianxian was very nice, it only had one room because Feng Xianxian lived alone. ”

“Feng Xianxian said considerately, “Grandmother, from now on, you’ll sleep in the master bedroom and I’ll sleep on the living room sofa.” ”

“Old Lady Lin held Feng Xianxian’s hand. “Silly child, grandmother can sleep on the sofa. You can sleep in the master bedroom.” ”

“Feng Xianxian smiled and said, “You have already suffered so much for me. How can I let you sleep on the sofa! I’ll sleep on the sofa. It’s settled then!” ”

“Old Lady Lin was very touched and continued, “Good child, it’s been hard on you.” ”

“Not only did her own son chase her out of the house, he even stopped her bank card. At this time, only Feng Xianxian was willing to pour her heart out to her. ”

“”It’s just sleeping on the sofa. It’s nothing,”Feng Xianxian continued, “Grandmother, do you really think that I’m such a delicate person? I’ll go and make the bed for you!” ”

Old Lady Lin nodded.

“After Feng Xianxian entered the bedroom, Old Lady Lin started to contact the Lin family’s boss and asked him to transfer the money to her. ”

“Lin Qing fan said, “Mom, you’re too muddle-headed! Jin city didn’t do anything wrong! If you hadn’t gone overboard, Jin City wouldn’t have turned a blind eye to you. I support him on this matter!” ”

Old Lady Lin scolded him for being an unfilial son and hung up the phone. She pulled out the name of the Lin family’s second son from her contact list.

She had many sons anyway.

The east was not bright and the west was bright.

The Lin family’s second son and Lin Qing fan had the same attitude.

Old Lady Lin went to contact the Lin family’s third son.

The brothers seemed to have made an agreement and refused to give a single cent to Old Lady Lin.

“The Lin family’s third son said, “Mom, you’re already so old. Can’t You Save Us Sons some trouble? The fourth son has already run away because of your anger. What more do you want? I advise you to apologize to Jin city and get Jin City to forgive you! In the future, you can retire peacefully. Jin city isn’t the kind of unreasonable person!” ”

Apologize?

Get Her to apologize to Lin Jin City?

Shouldn’t Lin Jin city be the one apologizing to her?

“In this world, how could a mother apologize to her son? ”

Old Lady Lin instantly felt that she had raised her sons in vain.

An ingrate who forgot his mother when he had a wife.

Old Lady Lin was so angry that she wanted to smash her phone.

All of them!

Did they all want to anger her to death.

“After the Lin brothers hung up the phone, they went to remind their sons and daughters-in-law not to secretly send money to Old Lady Lin. ”

“This time, they had to use this opportunity to teach Old Lady Lin a lesson. ”

“Sure enough, after Old Lady Lin Hung up on her sons, she went to look for her grandchildren. ”

But the result was still the same.

Old Lady Lin was very upset.

“She had so many sons and grandchildren, but what was the use? ”

“In the end, she still couldn’t compare to Feng Xianxian! ”

It was always easier to add flowers to the icing on the cake than to send charcoal in the snow.

“At this time, if it were not for Feng Xianxian, Old Lady Lin would not even know how to persist. ”

Did Lin Jincheng really think that she would be afraid if he cut off her economy?

Just you wait!

“In less than three days, Lin Jincheng would regret coming over to pick her up. ”

She was the old lady of the Lin family.

“If the Lin family did not have her suppression, would they still be able to survive? ”

“Especially those shareholders of the Lin Group, which of them did not follow Lin Jincheng wholeheartedly because of her face? ”

“If those old shareholders knew that she was chased out by Lin Jincheng, they would definitely change their faces. ”

“When that time came, she would definitely teach Lin Jincheng a lesson! ”

“If a tiger does not show its might, does it really think that she is a sick cat? ”

In the bedroom.

Feng Xianxian was making the bed for Old Lady Lin when her phone lit up.

Feng Xianxian picked up the phone and saw the content on it. Her eyes narrowed.

“Ten minutes later, Feng Xianxian came out of the room and walked to Old Lady Lin’s side. “Grandma, I’ve already made the bed. You can go in and rest for a while. By the way, what do you want to Eat Tonight? I’ll go buy groceries.” ”

“Old Lady Lin said, “I can eat anything.” ”

“Feng Xianxian smiled and said, “Then I’ll go buy groceries first.” ”

“Okay.”Old Lady Lin watched Feng Xianxian leave.

Feng Xianxian walked all the way out of the apartment.

“Miss Feng.”

“At this moment, a female voice sounded behind her. ”

“Miss Gao.”Feng Xianxian turned to look at the person who had come.

“Gao di continued, “That old woman from the Lin family has already moved into your house?” ”

“Yes.”Feng Qianqian nodded.

“Gao di handed Feng Qianqian two bottles of medicine, “The blue bottle is to suppress toxins. The white bottle has a health care effect. If you take two pills at the same time, it will cause the patient to have a stroke. No matter how brilliant the medical technology is, it can not be detected.” ”

“Feng Qianqian took the bottle, and a hint of hesitation flashed in her eyes. ”

She really hated Old Lady Lin.

“But for now, Old Lady Lin was still useful to her... ”

“”Compared to a person with flesh and blood and thoughts, and a marionette that can be manipulated by anyone, which one would you rather control?” ”

“Feng Xianxian said without hesitation, “The marionette, of course!” ”

“Gao di smiled and said, “Since Miss Feng understands this, you should also understand the meaning behind my words.” ”

“Why are you helping me?”Feng Xianxian raised her head warily.

“Gao di said, “I don’t know if Miss Feng has heard of the saying, ‘the enemy of an enemy is a friend’. Of course, Miss Feng can choose not to trust my words. But I have to remind Miss Feng that other than me, no one can help you now.” ”

Feng Xianxian put the medicine bottle into her bag.

Yes.

No one could help her now.

She had to fight for herself!

“Although she was making the bed in the bedroom, she had heard the phone calls of old Mrs. Lin and the Lin Brothers. ”

Old Mrs. Lin was basically kicked out of the house now.

“If she did not take the initiative, she would end up with nothing. ” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“As far as she knew, Old Lady Lin still held 50% of the shares in the LIN Group. ”

“If she could get Old Lady Lin to sign the share concession letter and fully support her, then the LIN Group would still have Lin Jincheng’s say? ”

Of course.

“Under Old Lady Lin’s conscious state, she definitely would not sign. ”

But what if Old Lady Lin had a stroke? What if she could not speak?

“Thinking of this, Feng Xianxian narrowed her eyes. ”

She had a plan in mind.

“Seeing Feng Xianxian like this, Gao Di’s lips curled into a smile. He said, “I think Miss Feng already has an answer in her heart, right? I wish Miss Feng Success.” ”

“With that, Gao di turned around and left. ”

“Walking to the corner, Gao di turned a corner and walked to the coffee shop on the side. ”

A fashionable girl wearing sunglasses was sitting at the window and drinking coffee.

“Sister Ya.”Gao Di walked directly to the girl’s side.

“”Everything is done?”The modern girl took off her glasses, revealing a beautiful face. ”

“If this wasn’t Wang Shuya, then who was it? ”
