The assistant found it strange that the exotic beast was able to return on its own.

“Logically speaking, the experimental base was like a cage to the exotic beast. It shouldn’t have been able to return after escaping. ”

“”Oh right, professor, there’s also this.”At this moment, the assistant seemed to have thought of something as he handed Mario a black chip. ”

Mario took the chip and frowned slightly. “What’s This?”

“The assistant continued, “This was brought back by the exotic beast.” ” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Mario looked at the expression in the chip’s eyes. After a moment, he continued, “Pass this to doctor William.” ”

“Alright.”The assistant took the chip from Mario’s hands and walked towards Doctor William’s office.

Mario stayed where he was and observed the exotic beasts that had returned.

“He had a nagging feeling that there was something different about the exotic beasts, but he couldn’t tell what it was. ”

“Mario was looking at the exotic beasts, while the exotic beasts were tilting their heads and looking at Mario. ”

The human and the exotic beasts were just looking at each other.

On the other side.

The assistant gave the black chip to doctor William.

“Dr. William took the chip and asked, “Did the exotic beast bring it back?” ”

“Yes.”

“Since the exotic beast brought something back, it couldn’t be studied with ordinary instruments. ”

Dr. William brought the chip back to the laboratory.

“Ten minutes later, a surprised voice came from the laboratory. ”

“”Oh my God! Go and call Mario over! Oh, forget it. I’ll go find him myself!” ”

“Just as he said this, professor William ran out of the laboratory. ”

Professor William ran all the way to Mario’s side.

“Seeing him come over, Mario asked, “The results of the experiment are out?” ”

William nodded excitedly. “Yes.”

“What is it?”Mario asked.

“William continued, “Old friend, you definitely won’t be able to guess!” ”

“Mario was very curious. “What is it? Hurry up and tell me!”From William’s looks, it shouldn’t be any bad news. ”

Then what kind of good news was it?

“William adjusted his breathing and continued, “It’s the perpetual motion energy! Yes, old friend, you didn’t hear wrongly! We have a perpetual motion machine!” ”

What?

Perpetual Motion Machine?

“At this moment, Mario could hardly believe his ears. ”

Perpetual Motion Machine!

It was actually a perpetual motion machine!

Mario grabbed William’s shoulders tightly. “What did you say? Say It Again! What do we have?”

Was their L continent finally going to have their own perpetual motion machine?

“William said excitedly, “Perpetual motion machine! We have a perpetual motion machine!” ”

“At this moment, Mario was so happy that he almost cried. ”

That’s great!

That’s really great!

“In his excitement, Mario hugged William tightly. ”

“After a moment, Mario calmed down and continued, “Are you sure that it’s a perpetual motion machine?” ”

“”Yes, I’m very sure!”William nodded his head firmly. “Follow me!” ”

William pulled Mario towards the laboratory.

“Very soon, the two of them arrived at the laboratory. ”

“William pointed at the glowing rotating object on the laboratory table and said, “Look!” ”

“Mario looked in the direction that William was pointing at. At this moment, he was almost in tears and was extremely excited. ”

He had waited.

He had finally waited.

“He knew that one day, he would have a perpetual motion machine. ”

The two of them were very excited. They wanted to use it again. They even cried out loud.

This kind of feeling could only be understood by scientists.

This was especially so for Mario.

He was filled with mixed emotions now.

“From not being understood at the beginning until now, he had finally obtained a perpetual motion machine. His persistence had finally borne fruit. This made him especially excited. ”

The perpetual motion machine had already come out. Was it still far from the days when those people’s faces would ache?

It wasn’t far.

Four years.

A whole four years.

China had stayed at the peak of no one for so long. It was time for them to roll down.

“To count the number of outstanding people, they still had to look at their continent! ”

“Thinking of this, Mario’s eyes were filled with a bright light. ”

“William turned his head to look at Mario and continued, “Old friend, you’re right! The exotic beasts can indeed bring us good fortune!” ”

“Where’s Keating?”Mario asked.

“”He should be in the C region laboratory,”William replied. ”

Mario’s lips curled into a smile. “Go and call him over.”

“Back then, Keating was the first person to oppose him. ”

“As a person from L continent, Keating had actually publicly supported ye Zao. ”

Such a person was simply a disgrace to the base.

“Now that the perpetual motion machine had appeared, he wanted to see how Keating would have the face to continue staying in the base. ”

William knew what Mario meant and nodded. “I’ll send for him right away.”
