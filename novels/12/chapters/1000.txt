Chapter 1001: 225: She’s Too Good for me! 2

Translator: 549690339

“Ye Zao was talking to Dr. Warne as he walked, so he did not notice Cen Shaoqing. It was not until he walked a few steps away that she felt that something was not right. She stepped back and asked, “Cen Shaoqing, why are you sleeping here?” ”

“After shouting for a while, ye Zao did not wake up. He reached out and poked Cen Shaoqing’s arm. “Cen Shaoqing?” ”

“Seeing this scene, Dr. Hua En was stunned and his face turned pale with fear. ”

“As everyone knew, CEN fifth master was a person who was not to be trifled with. He was very resistant to the opposite sex. ”

Although CEN Shaoqing had given awards to ye Zao before.

But the two of them were not close.

Ye Zao’s action would definitely make Cen Shaoqing angry.

Dr. Hua En had once witnessed a girl who wanted to get close to Cen Shaoqing being thrown several meters away by Cen Shaoqing.

Two of the girl’s front teeth had been knocked off. She was so scared that she did not dare to find a boyfriend for three years!

This showed how ruthless Cen Shaoqing was.

“Just when Dr. Warne was feeling uneasy and wanted to protect ye Zao behind him, Cen Shaoqing slowly opened his eyes. There was no anger in his eyes as Dr. Warne had imagined. Instead, he spoke in a warm voice, like a sharp ice meeting a warm sun. ”

“Are you done?”

“”Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly and continued, “When did you come back?” ”

Cen Shaoqing twirled the prayer beads out of habit. “I just arrived not long ago.”

“Ye Zao saw that Cen Shaoqing still had a tired look between his brows and guessed that he must have not slept well for several days. He continued, “The problem on my side has almost been solved. Why don’t I accompany you to rest in the hotel for a while?” ”

“Okay.”

“This familiar tone stunned Dr. Warne once again. He turned to look at Ye Zao. “Miss Ye, are you and master five friends?” ”

Cen Shaoqing did not seem to be the kind of person who made friends with the opposite sex.

“Ye Zao looked up slightly. “Let me introduce you. This is my boyfriend, Cen Shaoqing.” ”

Boyfriend?

These two were actually boyfriend and girlfriend!

“Professor Warne’s eyes were filled with disbelief. “Master Five, isn’t he an unmarried man?” ”

Everyone in Beijing knew that Cen Shaoqing was an unmarried man!

“Because of this, many people felt that it was a pity. ”

“After all, CEN Shaoqing had good genes. Wouldn’t it be a pity if such good genes were not inherited? ”

Who would have thought that this unmarried man would actually have a girlfriend now.

“For a moment, Dr. Warne could not believe his ears. ”

Ye Zao had always been a very low-key person. Cen Shaoqing did not expect that she would introduce him so formally in front of Dr. Warne.

This was a form of recognition for him!

“The tiredness on Cen Shaoqing’s brows disappeared in an instant. He looked up at Dr. Warne and continued, “Before I met ye Zao, I was indeed an unmarried person. But after I met her, I was no longer one.” ”

Dr. Warne was in disbelief.

“When he looked back, even Cen Shaoqing himself felt that everything was like a dream. ”

He was extremely glad that he had gone to Yun Jing.

“If he had insisted on not going to Yun Jing at that time, then who was the person beside ye Zao Now? ”

“Every time he thought of this question, Cen Shaoqing felt that he could not breathe. ”

“Dr. Warne gulped as if he was looking up at Cen Shaoqing. Then, he looked at Ye Zhuo. “Miss Ye, are you... are you really in a relationship? Are you not making fun of an old man like me?” ” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Cen Shaoqing had single-handedly founded the CEN Group and the Dark Moon Alliance. Behind him was a mysterious force that stood at the top of the pyramid.

Ye Zhuo was a technology tycoon who had his own achievements in various fields.

It was not an exaggeration to call her an extraordinary woman!

Such an evenly matched pair of people together was simply an amazing existence.

Ye Zao smiled slightly. “Do you think I’m someone who would joke about such things?”

It was true.

It was actually true.

“Professor Hua en paused for a moment and continued, “Then I wish the two of you a long and lasting marriage.” ”

“”Thank you, Dr. Warne.”Cen Shaoqing looked up and thanked him. ”

Dr. Warne looked at Cen Shaoqing and felt that Cen Shaoqing had changed a lot.

Cen Wuye used to be quiet and stood there like an ice sculpture. He was not as approachable as he was now.

“Although Cen Shaoqing was still difficult to get in touch with now, he had changed a lot compared to before. ”

It seemed that love was really a magical thing.

Dr. Warne was filled with emotions.

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Dr. Warne, we’ll be going back first. If there are any problems, you can call me.” ”
