“Chapter 1702: 353: chasing his wife Crematorium, regret until his intestines turned green! (second watch)1”

Translator: 549690339

Wu Jiaguo fell because of this.

“At this time, distancing himself from this mother and daughter was the best choice.”

Although Zou Feifei was Zou Minglang’s biological flesh and blood.

“But, in the business world, there was no father and son.”

“This kind of daughter, would only become a hindrance to the existence!”

Forget it!

“Without Zou Feifei as a daughter, he would have an even more outstanding daughter in the future.”

“If Zou Feifei didn’t cause trouble outside, how could the Zou group’s money laundering matter be found out.”

All of this was because of Zou Feifei!

“For the current Zou minglang, there was no father-daughter relationship between him and Zou Feifei!”

“In the face of interests, family and father-daughter relationship were not worth mentioning at all.”

“Hearing this, Zou’s mother’s face was full of disbelief. “What? What did you say? You Want to divorce me? No, I don’t agree!””

She didn’t agree to a divorce.

“If she got a divorce, how would she be able to live alone in the future.”

A lean camel was bigger than a horse. Even if Zou Minglang’s financial company was closed down. He also had other businesses under his name. They could still live a comfortable life.

Therefore.

They could not get a divorce!

They definitely could not get a divorce!

“”Minglang! Feifei is your biological daughter. You Can’t be so heartless!”Zou’s mother continued, “Feifei is still young. Minglang, please forgive her this time! As long as you teach her diligently, she will definitely get better in the future! Minglang, I beg you not to be so heartless!””

“Zou minglang pointed at Zou feifei and said, “She has become like this because you spoiled her! A loving mother is a waste of a child!””

“But she is your biological daughter!”Zou’s mother’s voice was close to hoarse.

How could someone ignore their own biological daughter.

No.

No.

Zou minglang was definitely scaring them.

“”If you don’t agree, I can only go to the court and Sue.””

“After saying that, Zou minglang stood up from the ground and walked to the third floor.”

He had to pack his things and move out of this house as soon as possible.

Zou’s mother looked at Zou’s father’s back and her eyes were filled with sadness.

She suddenly understood a sentence.

“The husband and wife were originally birds in the same forest. When disaster struck, they would fly separately.”

“After being married to Zou minglang for so many years, Zou’s mother knew that he must have someone outside.”

It was her fault.

It was her fault for being stupid and not realizing it.

“Dad!”Zou feifei called out.

But Zou Minglang didn’t even turn his head and went upstairs.

“After Zou minglang packed his things, he left the villa in a hurry. He didn’t even look at the mother and son.”

“Zou Feifei hugged mother Zou and cried uncontrollably. “Mom, Mom, what should we do now?””

“Before Zou Feifei could finish crying, a group of people in uniform walked over. “Zou Feifei, right? We’re from the Linan Road police station. Please come with us.””

“Zou feifei subconsciously sat behind Zou’s mother. “Mom, save me!””

“But at this time, how could Zou’s mother still have the ability to save Zou Feifei?”

She could only follow them out and watch Zou Feifei get into the police car.

In just a few hours.

The Zou family had undergone a drastic change.

“Zou’s mother leaned against the door frame, almost unable to believe that it was true.”

Regret!

She was very regretful now.

“She should not have protected Zou feifei at that time, and she should not have asked Wu Jiaguo for help.”

“Now, not only did she implicate Wu Jiaguo, so that the Zou family’s situation became like this.”

“Originally, this was just a small matter.”

Wu Jiaguo was also regretful.

He was even more regretful than Zou’s mother.

“He and Zou’s mother were childhood sweethearts who grew up together. Later on, the two of them gradually grew up, and because of some reasons, they separated. When they met again, the former childhood sweetheart was already a mother, and he was already a father!”

The things that were hidden deep in the bottom of his heart also gradually surfaced on the day he met Zou’s mother.

“However, love had already turned into familial love.”

“Coincidentally, Zou Feifei was the same age as Wu Jiaguo’s daughter who died prematurely. When he saw Zou Feifei, Wu Jiaguo felt like he saw his own daughter.”

“Therefore, Wu Jiaguo acknowledged Zou Feifei as his goddaughter and doted on her.” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

He never thought that this goddaughter would one day cause him to lose everything!

“If time could be repeated, he would never acknowledge Zou Feifei as his goddaughter!”

“Unfortunately, there were no ifs in this world.”

Wu Jiaguo squatted on the ground and sobbed softly.

“At this moment, the sound of footsteps came from the air. A gentle female voice sounded in the air. “During this period of time, you should stay at home and calm down. I’ll bring little treasure back to my mother’s house to stay for a period of time.””

“”Okay.”Wu Jiaguo suppressed the emotions in his body and continued, “Take care on the road.””
