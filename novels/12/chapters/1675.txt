Translator: 549690339

“”Speaking of Miss Ye, she’s really a formidable young lady! I heard from Zifei that she’s only a little over 20 years old! How do you think her parents gave birth to her? How can she be so formidable!”Although Tian Zhifang had never met ye Zao before, she was still very impressed by him, in Tian Zhifang’s eyes, Ye Zao was an omnipotent existence. ”

Other People’s 20-year-olds were earth-shattering. Her 20-year-old was busy dating Yu Zifei’s father.

It was really infuriating to compare people!

“Father Yu smiled and said, “Do you really think that everyone can be a genius?”Geniuses were all one in ten thousand. ”

“That’s true.”

Downstairs.

Yu Zifei had just gone downstairs when Zhang Pandi walked out from the side. “Zifei!”

Yu Zifei was stunned when he suddenly saw Zhang Pandi. He had no intention of paying attention to her.

“”Zifei! I know, I know. Yu Yuan isn’t your girlfriend at all. She’s Your Cousin!”Zhang Pandi ran over, she tugged at Yu Zifei’s sleeve. “Zifei, I know that you still have me in your heart. Give me a chance and I’ll give you a chance too, okay? Let’s get back together! I swear that I’ll never leave you again!” ”

“Yu Zifei’s long brows were tightly knitted. “Zhang Pandi, I’ll tell you one last time. It’s impossible between us! The current you will only make me sick!”After saying that, Yu Zifei directly shook Zhang Pandi off. ”

“Looking at the strange man in front of her, Zhang Pandi was stunned. ”

Sick.

Yu Zifei actually said that she was sick.

This was the man she had loved for three years.

“When she left Yu Zifei, it was only because she had no choice. Why didn’t Yu Zifei forgive her? ”

Zhang Pandi’s tears almost burst out.

...

“At 11:30 am, the aircraft carrier successfully landed on Mars. ”

Ye Zhuo also went with her.

“Seeing that they had successfully set up camp on Mars and set up a defense system, Ye Zhuo took the aircraft carrier back to Earth. ”

Time passed quickly.

“In the blink of an eye, it was already half a month. ”

June 5th. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

June 7th was the day of the college entrance exam. Ye Zhuo planned to return to Yunjing and accompany Lin Sha to participate in the college entrance exam.

“Lin Sha had originally taken the college entrance exam last year, but before the college entrance exam, Lin Sha suddenly had an attack of appendicitis, so she had no choice but to give up the exam and re-apply for this year’s college entrance exam. ”

Cen Shaoqing and Ye Zhuo went to the airport together.

“Although both of them were going to the airport, their destination was not the same. ”

“Cen Shaoqing was going abroad on business, while ye Zao was going to Yunjing. ”

“After sending ye Zao to the domestic terminal, CEN Shaoqing instructed, “Leader, pay attention to your safety. Remember to call me as soon as you get there.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“Cen Shaoqing lowered his eyes and helped ye Zao adjust his collar. After a moment, he planted a light kiss on the side of her face and said in a low voice, “Okay, go in quickly.” ”

“”Goodbye, Mr. Cen.” ”

Cen Shaoqing smiled and watched her leave.

“Four hours later, the plane landed at Yunjing Airport. ”

Ye Zao called Cen Shaoqing to tell him that she was safe.

She held her phone in one hand and her suitcase in the other as she walked towards the exit.

“”Zao Zao!”Seeing ye Zao come out from inside, Lin Sha waved her hand excitedly. ”

“Sister Sha Sha.”Ye Zao walked over with a smile.

“This scene fell into the eyes of a girl who was also waiting for her at the airport. The girl nudged her companion with her elbow. “Hey, Fei Fei! Look who it is!” ”

Zou feifei frowned slightly. “Lin Sha Sha?”

“”It’s Lin Sha Sha. I heard that she is going to participate in this year’s college entrance exam.”Ning lan continued, “It seems that this year’s college entrance exam champion is definitely Lin Sha’s! I heard that she scored 736 points in the mock exam last time!” ”

“736?”Zou feifei pinched his fingers.

“Yes.”Ning Lan nodded.

“Zou feifei narrowed his eyes and continued, “I heard that she missed the college entrance exam last year because of her appendix. If anything happens this year...” ”
