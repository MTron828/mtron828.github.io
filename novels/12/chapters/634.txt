Chapter 635: 148: teach the scum how to behave! 6

Translator: 549690339

“Female Durban was against morality, so of course it was illegal.”

“Sun Yiguo took a deep breath and smiled. “Miss Ye, this is all a misunderstanding! It’s getting late, why don’t we send you back first!””

“Hearing that, Sun Shu frowned.”

Send Ye Zhuo back?

How could they send her back!

A B * tch like ye Zhuo should stay in female Durban and properly educate her.

“Second uncle!”

Sun Yiguo glared at Sun Shu. “Shut up!”

“Sun Shu’s face turned pale, and an ominous premonition arose spontaneously.”

“”Go Back? I came to your female Durban to learn the three followers and four Virtues, and you want me to go back?”Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly. “What if I don’t go back?””

Didn’t he know that it was easier to invite the gods than to send them off?

“Sun Yiguo was about to cry. “Ye, Miss Ye! Don’t joke around! I’ll get these two blind people to apologize to you! Please be magnanimous and forgive us this time!””

“After saying that, Sun Yiguo looked at Sun Shu and Zhang Haiyuan again. “The two of you, hurry up and apologize to Miss Ye!””

“Since things had developed to this point, Zhang Haiyuan also knew the seriousness of the matter and quickly apologized. “Miss Ye, I’m sorry! It’s all my fault. I underestimated you!””

Sun Shu did not want to apologize to Ye Zhuo.

What right did she have to lower herself to apologize to the daughter of a mistress?

“Ye Zhuo, this little b * Tch, was she worthy?”

It seemed that Sun Yiguo was also old and muddle-headed!

What was there to be afraid of about a little B * tch?

“I won’t apologize to such a B * Tch!”

“As soon as these words were said, the air became deathly silent.”

Idiot! VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

He was simply an idiot!

Sun Yiguo could not contain his anger. He walked over and slapped Sun Shu’s perfectly fine right cheek. “I think you’re the despicable person! B * Stard! Quickly apologize to Miss Ye!”

Sun Shu was beaten until her eyes were full of stars. It took her a long time to react. She looked at Sun Yiguo in disbelief. “Second uncle!”

Sun Yiguo did not have any children. She was his only niece. He usually treated her like his own daughter.

He did not expect Sun Yiguo to actually hit her today.

“Sun Shu was frightened by Sun Yiguo’s behavior. She stammered and apologized to ye zhuo, “Miss Ye, I’m sorry. I’m the one who’s despicable. Please forgive me...””

Ye Zhuo flipped the phone in his palm and looked indifferent.

“Ye Zhuo’s sudden silence made Sun Yiguo even more flustered. He raised his hand and kept wiping the beads of sweat on his forehead. “Miss... Miss Ye, shall I send you back?””

“”I told you, I’m here for class.””

Sun Yiguo almost knelt on the ground and called out to his ancestors.

“In the end, there was really no other way. In order to appease ye Zhuo’s anger, Sun Yiguo and Zhang Haiyuan had no choice but to personally carry ye Zhuo out.”

“Of course, Ye Zhuo was sitting on a chair.”

“These two people usually wished that they could trample all the women under their feet. This was the first time they had suffered such a silent loss, yet they dared not speak out.”

“After the car stopped at the Lin Manor, the two of them carried the chairs to Old Lady Lin’s west courtyard.”

In the hall.

Feng Qianhua and Feng Xianxian were chatting with Old Lady Lin.

“When the three of them saw Sun Yiguo and Zhang Haiyuan carrying ye Zhuo in, they were dumbfounded.”

They even thought that they were hallucinating.

No one expected that ye Zhuo would actually be carried back by the two female Durban leaders like an ancestor.

“Sun Yiguo and Zhang Haiyuan carefully placed the chairs on the ground, afraid that they would accidentally drop this living ancestor.”

“After a long while, Old Lady Lin finally reacted, she frowned and said, “Mr. Zhang! Why did you send her back? Did My uneducated granddaughter make you angry? Don’t be angry, I will let her apologize to you!””

It must be because ye Zhuo was disobedient and had been returned!

“Zhang Haiyuan was so scared that he broke out in cold sweat, he hurriedly said, “Old lady, what are you talking about?”? Your granddaughter, Miss Ye, is well-educated, extraordinary, and has a beautiful heart. She has sharp ears, sharp eyes, and graceful bearing! There is no need for her to attend the female Durban class at all. This is the tuition fee that you paid, and this is the contract that we signed! “Please keep it well!””

“”Other than the tuition fee, this is the compensation for Miss Ye’s mental loss!””

“Educated and reasonable, extraordinary and refined, with a pure blue heart, sharp ears, sharp eyes, and graceful bearing?”

These idioms have something to do with ye Zao?

Old Lady Lin was completely stunned. She thought that she had heard wrongly.

“After saying that, Zhang Haiyuan apologized to ye Zao again, “Miss Ye, I was blind today and accidentally offended you. Your Prime Minister has a good mind, so please don’t lower yourself to the level of a villain like me!””
