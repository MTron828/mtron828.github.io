Zhao Dan nodded. “Mr. Xiao Ye.”

“Ye Han continued, “Madam, please take a seat first. I’ll accompany my sister to the meeting.” ”

“”Mr. Xiao Ye, go and get busy,”Zhao Dan said. ”

Ye Han turned around and followed ye Zhuo’s footsteps.

The two of them walked in the direction of the meeting room.

“When they reached the meeting room, Ye Zhuo realized that the meeting room was actually empty. ”

“Ye Zhuo looked at Ye Han, his beautiful phoenix eyes filled with doubt. ”

“Ye Han smiled and said, “I knew that you were annoyed with that Zhao Dan, so I casually found an excuse to bring you out.” ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled slightly and continued, “Coincidentally, I also have something to tell you.” ”

“What is it?”Ye Han asked.

“Ye Zhuo said, “You sit down first.” ”

Ye Han sat on the chair.

“Ye Zhuo sat opposite ye Han. He turned on the communicator and connected to his assistant. “Xiao Fen, bring me the documents on my desk in my office.” ”

“”Yes, Miss Ye.”The assistant replied very quickly. ”

“Ye Han asked curiously, “Sister, what do you want to tell me?” ”

“”Something very important,”ye Zhuo said. ”

Something very important?

Then what was it?

Ye Han was a little curious.

“A moment later, there was a knock on the door. ”

“Ye Zao said slowly, “Come in.” ”

“His assistant, Xiao Fen, pushed the door open and came in. She handed the document to Ye Zao. “Miss Ye, can you take a look at this document?” ”

“Ye Zao took the document, flipped through two pages, and nodded slightly. “It’s this.”. ”

“The assistant continued, “Then I’ll go out first, Miss Ye.” ”

“”Okay, you can go out,”ye Zhuo said. ”

“The assistant turned around and left, closing the meeting room door. ”

Ye Zhuo handed the document to Ye Han. “Take a look at this.”

“Ye Han took the document and flipped through it. Two minutes later, the document was placed on the table like a hot potato. “Sister, what are you doing?” ”

“To be more precise, this was a letter of abdication. ”

“Ye Zhuo handed over the management rights, military power, and all of it to Ye Han. ”

Ye Han would be the next monarch.

“I’m too tired.”Ye Zhuo looked at Ye Han. “Can’t you let your sister experience the joy of retirement?”

“”No!”Ye Han continued, “You are the pillar of the Chang Yue Kingdom. I Can’t do it! Why are you handing over the power to me now?” ”

“”I believe you. You can do it.”Ye Zhuo looked at ye Han seriously and continued, “Ye Han, you are my only younger brother. If you don’t help me, no one can help me.” ”

“”Sister, can’t you stay in Changyue?”Ye Han looked at ye Zhuo, “It’s not easy for us siblings to reunite. You want to leave already?” ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “It’s not like I’m not coming back. Don’t worry, I’ll often bring your brother-in-law and your parents to visit you. Oh right, I have a twin brother on Earth.” ”

“Ye Han was happy for ye Zao to have a family again, but it was true that he couldn’t bear to part with them. ”

“In changyue, Ye Zao was his only sister. ”

“Elder sister...”Ye Han looked at Ye Zhuo. “Why don’t you bring them to the S Galaxy?”

Ye Zhuo shook his head slightly. “They were born on Earth and grew up on Earth. They won’t be able to adapt to the living environment here.”

The S galaxy was very different from Earth.

Ye Han frowned and didn’t say anything else.

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Ye Han, I know you have this ability. You’ll definitely be able to lead changyue to a better tomorrow.” ”

“”Sister...”ye Han said worriedly, “Earth is so far away from the s galaxy. You Don’t have anything there. What if you get bullied? In short, I don’t agree. You will always be the female monarch of Changyue!” ”

“Although ye Zhuo was very powerful, she was still a girl. ”

“Moreover, people were born with weaknesses. ”

“What if one day, Ye Zhuo was bullied? ”

It would be different in changyue.

“”Don’t worry, no one will bully me.”Ye Zhuo patted ye Han’s shoulder. “I’ll take care of things and return to Earth the day after tomorrow. You should come back with me to take a look.” ” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Ye Han hesitated for a moment, then nodded. ”

Over here.

Zhao Dan sat in the conference room and drank two cups of tea in a row. Ye Zhuo didn’t come again.

“Not only did ye Zao not come, there was not even a servant. ”

Zhao Dan’s expression did not look too good.

“She was the first lady of Manxing Country, and this was how ye Zao treated her? ”

Zhao Dan stood up and paced around the room.

“Time passed by minute by minute, until two hours later, there was no movement from ye Zao’s side. ”

“Seeing that the sky was about to turn dark, Zhao Dan could not sit still anymore. He stood up and walked out. ”

“Just as he walked out, he ran into ye Zhuo’s assistant, Xiao Fen. ”
