Translator: 549690339

The Great Witch Doctor had just captured Joey.

“At this time, the only hope of Li Ziyue and the others was ye Han. ”

“As long as they could wake ye Han up, the plan would be half successful. ”

“Thinking of this, Qiu Changzhen’s heart skipped a beat. ”

No.

They must not let Li Ziyue succeed.

“”Right.”Qiu Di nodded. “Father, you’re right. The person who just arrived is most likely Li Ziyue.” ”

“Then why aren’t you chasing after him!”Qiu Chang Zhen frowned. “What if they succeed?”

“Succeed?”Qiu di smiled at Qiu Chang Zhen. “It seems that father still doesn’t understand what Gu worms represent.”

“I know that Gu Worms are very powerful!”! “But you have to know that even the most powerful gu worms have an antidote!”Qiu Chang Zhen continued. “That Joey is very strange!”! What if her fake will was captured by Zhou Qing to dispel our doubts?”

“As the saying goes, the older the wiser. ”

“Autumn town was after all autumn flute’s father, so he naturally had more questions to consider than autumn flute. ”

“If Joey was hiding his strength, the consequences would be unimaginable! ”

“”Not to mention that Joey has already been captured by the Great Witch Doctor, just talk about the Gu in ye Han.”Autumn flute looked at autumn town and continued, “Then do you know what is needed to remove the GU in ye Han’s body?” ”

“What?”Autumn town asked.

“I need the purple leaf flower.”Autumn flute said.

“Autumn town narrowed his eyes, “Purple leaf flower?” ”

“Yes.”Autumn flute nodded.

“Autumn town asked, “Is it the purple leaf flower from the immemorial glacier?” ”

Autumn flute nodded.

“Hearing this, autumn town heaved a sigh of relief. ”

The purple leaf flower was a legendary herb.

“In other words, even if there was one, no one could pick it. ”

“According to the records, the purple night flower bloomed for a thousand years and bore fruit for ten thousand years. Beside each purple night flower, there was an unusually fierce snow monster protecting it. ”

“After so many years, autumn town had only seen the purple night flower in ancient books. ”

“”So, father, do you still need to worry about whether ye Han will recover his memory?”Autumn flute turned to look at autumn town. ”

“Autumn town smiled and said, “Indeed, I am worrying too much.” ”

“Autumn flute put down the cup and continued, “When a dog is desperate, it will jump over the wall. Li Zi Yue and the others have no other choice, which is why they have come to this point! Just wait and see, they will pay the price for their stupidity.” ”

“Autumn town nodded, feeling that what autumn flute said was very reasonable. ”

“Ye Han’s poison was incurable, so naturally, he would not recognize his own family. ”

“When the time came, would Li Zi Yue’s little life be saved? ”

Dream On!

“At this moment, someone knocked on the door. ”

“”Come in,”Qiu di said. ”

“A moment later, the assistant pushed the door open and entered. “Eldest miss, chief ye is here.” ”

Chief Ye?

“Hearing this name, Qiu Changzhen was stunned for a moment before he realized that the chief ye that the assistant mentioned should be ye Lan. ”

He did not know what method Qiu di used to make ye Lan so loyal.

“Logically speaking, ye Lan should not have betrayed ye Zao. ”

“After all, Ye Zao was extremely indebted to Ye Lan. ”

“Qiu Chang Zhen narrowed his eyes, and a bright light flashed in his eyes. ”

This ye Lan...

Was she waiting for an opportunity to take revenge?

Qiu Di nodded. “Let her in.”

“Okay.”The assistant nodded and walked out to let ye Lan in.

“”Young miss.”In front of Qiu Di, Ye Lan was very respectful, afraid that she would accidentally offend Qiu Di. ”

“After all, Qiu Di was helping her investigate her background. ”

“Thinking that she would soon be the princess of Manxing Kingdom who was below one person and above ten thousand people, the curve on ye Lan’s face became even more obvious. ”

“Sister Ye Lan.”Qiu Di smiled and called her very intimately.

“But in her heart, she was mocking ye Lan for being an idiot. ”

She couldn’t even differentiate between acting and acting.

What Qiu Di didn’t expect was that ye Lan actually believed the lie that she was the princess of Manxing Kingdom.

Ye Lan didn’t even look at her own weight

Just Her?

A legitimate princess?

She wasn’t even fit to carry the princess’shoes.

She simply didn’t have a brain.

She was the ultimate idiot among idiots!

Ye Lan looked at autumn town. “Commander Qiu.”

Autumn town nodded and didn’t say anything.

“Autumn flute continued, “Father, you can go out first. I’ll have a chat with sister ye Lan.” ”

“Okay.”Autumn town turned around and left.

Qiu Di personally poured a cup of water for ye Lan. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“”Sister Ye Lan, drink some water.” ”

“”Thank you, young miss.”Ye Lan received the cup of water with both hands, feeling a little flattered. ”

“”You’re welcome.”Qiu di continued, “Take a seat.” ”

“Ye Lan did not sit down. She continued, “Young miss, I came here because I have something to personally give you.” ”

“”You can just get someone to bring it over.”Qiu di smiled and said, “It’s worth you coming all the way here.” ”
