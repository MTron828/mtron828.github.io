“Ye Shu said, “Let me give you a hint. The boy and Ah Ze are good friends.” ”

Good friends with Lin Ze?

Lin Jincheng’s eyes widened. “Could it be fat tiger?”

“No.”Ye Shu shook her head.

“Mozzie?”

Ye Shu still shook her head.

“Lin Jincheng said, “It can’t be dog two, right?” ” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Ye Shu chuckled. “It’s him.”

“How could Lin Jincheng have imagined that one day, buttface would be able to get together with an Lizi. ”

“”So it’s that child! As I said, that child is really not bad! If Lizi can get together with him, she will definitely be very happy in the future!” ”

“Then how does buttface compare to Shaoqing?”Ye Shu asked.

“Lin Jincheng said, “That definitely can’t be compared to Shaoqing!” ”

“Even though he despised him, in Lin Jincheng’s heart, there was still no boy who could surpass Cen Shaoqing. ”

“Ye Shu said, “Then why are you still picking on him! Let’s sleep early tonight. We have to go to fourth brother and fourth sister-in-law’s Place First Thing Tomorrow Morning!” ”

“After saying that, Ye Shu stood up and said, “You sleep first. I’ll go tell burning and Ah Ze.” ”

“”Okay, go quickly. I’ll wait for You,”Lin Jincheng said. ”

Ye Shu first went to Lin Ze and Bai Jingshu’s place.

Lin Ze hadn’t returned yet.

“Bai Jingshu was listening to the prenatal music. When she saw ye Shu come in, she immediately stood up from her chair. “Mom.” ”

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “Quickly sit down and sit down. Has Ah Ze not returned yet?” ”

“Not yet.”Bai Jingshu shook her head. “He’s been quite busy recently.”

“Ye Shu nodded. “Jingshu, wait for Ah Ze to come back. Tell him that no matter how important the matter is, he has to cancel it tomorrow.” ”

“Did something happen?”Bai Jingshu asked.

“Ye Shu said, “Go to your fourth uncle and fourth aunt’s house tomorrow. Lizi will bring her boyfriend back tomorrow.” ”

“”Really?”Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “Then fourth uncle and fourth aunt can finally be at ease!” ”

“Yes!”Ye Shu nodded.

“After leaving Bai Jingshu’s place, Ye Shu made another trip to ye Zao’s place. ”

“Upon hearing this, little white immediately said, “Then what should I do?”Ye Zao promised it that he would send it to the meeting tomorrow. ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Don’t worry. Since I’ve promised you, I’ll send you to the meeting first before going to fourth uncle’s house. But you have to come back on your own!” ”

Ye Shu was confused. “What Meeting Room?”

“Ye Zhuo explained, “Little White is going to meet online friends tomorrow.” ”

Ye Shu was stunned.

Robots also like to chat online?

And meet online friends?

Ye Shu was a little worried. She explained some things to little white about meeting online friends before leaving.

“The next day, Cen Shaoqing came early in the morning and sent little white to meet online friends with Ye Zhuo. ”

The traffic in Beijing was a little congested in the morning.

The two of them set off at 9:30 am and arrived at Times Square at 10:30 am.

“Little White alighted from the car. “Goodbye, Big Burning!” ”

Ye Zhuo glanced to the side. “Have your netizens arrived yet?”

“”Not yet, there’s no rush. I’ll wait for it for a while. As a person, the most important thing is to be a gentleman,”little white continued. “When it arrives, I’ll text you.” ”

“”Alright, take care of yourself. I’ll go back first.” ”

“Okay.”Whitey nodded obediently.

Cen Shaoqing drove to Lin Qingxuan’s villa.

“When the two of them arrived, the villa was bustling with activity. Dog two had already arrived and was introducing itself to everyone. ”

“”Hello, uncle and Auntie. I’m Ouyang Cheng.” ”

Ouyang Cheng.

This was the first time ye Zhuo knew dog two’s name.

“She quietly tugged at CEN Shaoqing’s sleeve and said with a smile, “I thought dog two’s name was dog two. I didn’t expect it to be such a nice name.” ”

“It’s better than my name?”Cen Shaoqing raised his eyebrows slightly.

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Of course not.” ”

Cen Shaoqing was finally satisfied.

“At this moment, an Lizi had already brought dog two to the front of the two people. An lizi smiled and said, “Zao Zao, you don’t need me to introduce you to Lord Five, right?” ”

“Buttface took the initiative to extend his hand to Cen Shaoqing. “Hello, brother-in-law. I’m Ouyang Cheng.” ”

“Hello.”
