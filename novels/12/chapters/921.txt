“Chapter 922: 213: Shunxi Financial Group, the top aristocrats among the aristocrats”

Translator: 549690339

Big families were indeed different.

Even the butler was so imposing.

“After ten minutes, they finally arrived at the main hall of the CEN family. ”

There was a group of people sitting in the hall.

“Old Mrs. Cen and Zhou Xiang sat at the head of the table, while the rest of the younger generation sat on both sides. ”

“This was the first time Zhou Rui had seriously come into contact with a real aristocrat. Moreover, it was the top aristocrat among the aristocrats. It would be a lie to say that he was not nervous. Zhou Rui’s hands were shaking. ”

“”Don’t be nervous,”Cen Yuyan comforted him in a low voice. “My mother and my grandmother are very easy to talk to.” ”

“Okay.”Zhou Rui swallowed his saliva. “I’m not nervous.”

“Although he said that he was not nervous, Zhou Rui’s hands were shaking even more violently. ”

“Cen Yuyan held Zhou Rui’s hand and walked in front of everyone. “Grandma, Mom, this is my boyfriend, Zhou Rui.” ”

Old Mrs. Cen Looked Zhou Rui up and down and frowned slightly.

She originally thought that Cen Yuyan really had eyes this time.

But what was this thing that she brought back?

A proper gigolo!

He was timid and did not have the slightest bit of manliness.

“Seeing that Zhou Rui did not speak for a long time, Cen Yuyan hurriedly pinched Zhou Rui’s hand. Only then did Zhou Rui react and hurriedly greeted, “Auntie, Grandma, I’m Zhou Rui.” ”

“Old madam CEN continued, “How Old Are you this year?” ”

“”Twenty-one,”Zhou Rui answered. ”

Twenty-one?

“This answer not only stunned old madam Cen, but also Zhou Xiang and the other three daughters and sons-in-law. ”

Cen Yuyan was thirty-nine this year.

Zhou Rui was twenty-one.

There was too much of a difference.

“Second brother-in-law Zou Lanwan looked at Cen Yueya and said in a low voice, “Your fourth sister is like an old cow eating young grass!” ”

Cen Yueya’s expression also did not look good. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Twenty-one years old.

“The difference between these two people was eighteen years. Cen Yuyan could have given birth to Zhou Rui, but Cen Yuyan was lucky to be able to keep her mouth shut! ”

“Cen Yuyan had said it so well before, and Cen Yueya had really thought that she had found an excellent boyfriend. ”

He did not expect it to be like this.

This made Cen Yueya very disappointed.

“Seeing that everyone’s expressions were not too good.., cen Yuyan hurriedly said, “Grandma, Mom, don’t look at Zhou Rui as young, but Zhou Rui is very mature! He has his own company and career! He’s also good to me. The two of us don’t have the sense of distance brought about by age when we’re together!” ”

“Even Zhou Rui’s parents did not dislike her for being older, so what could the Cen family dislike about Zhou Rui being young? ”

“After all, she was the one who took advantage of them. ”

Zhou Xiang drank a mouthful of water and looked up at the two of them. “Isn’t the difference too big?”

“”It’s not too big, it’s not too big. I think it’s just right,”Zhou Rui quickly said. “Auntie, I like Yuyan very much. Don’t worry about me.” ”

Zhou Xiang frowned.

“Cen Yuyan followed up immediately. “Mom, what era is it now? Why are you still talking about this? Besides, Shaoqing is older than Zhuluo by more than ten years. I don’t see you have any objections against the two of them.” ”

“As she finished speaking, Cen Yuyan looked around. “Why don’t I see Shaoqing and zhongruo?” ”

“They’re still on the way.”

“OH.”Cen Yuyan nodded and pulled Zhou Rui to the front of her sisters and brother-in-law. “This is eldest sister and eldest brother-in-law. This is second sister and second brother-in-law. This is third sister and third brother-in-law.”

Zhou Rui followed behind and called for help.

“Cen Yueya and Cen Yueying were twins and looked the most alike. Eldest sister Cen Yuying looked a little like old Madam Cen. The CEN sisters each had their own merits. If one had to make a comparison.., it should be Cen Yuying. ”

“After all, Old Lady Cen was a great beauty when she was young! ”

“Although the three sisters were somewhat dissatisfied with Zhou Rui, they did not embarrass him in the end. ”

“At this moment, the sound of footsteps came from outside the door. ”

Zhou Rui looked up and saw two figures walking over.

“Against the light, it was difficult to see their faces clearly, but the domineering aura on their bodies could not be ignored. ”
