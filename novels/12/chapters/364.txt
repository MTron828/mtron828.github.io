No wonder Feng Qianhua was so determined to marry into the Lin family.

She had endured it all until now.

“Once she married into the Lin family, she would think of a way to tell Feng Xianxian to the CEN family. At that time, the entire capital would be in the hands of the mother and daughter. ”

“Old Mrs. Lin ordered the servants to serve tea again. When she saw that the person who served the tea was a young girl, she asked curiously, “Where’s sister-in-law Zhang? Why haven’t I seen sister-in-law Zhang?” ”

“Sister Zhang isn’t feeling well today.”

“Mrs. Lin nodded. “Since she’s not feeling well, let her rest well.” ”

“After saying that, she looked at Old Madam Feng. “Elder sister, this is the first tea of the year. How does it taste?” ”

Old Madam Feng picked up the Teacup. “The things you have here are definitely the best.”

The two old ladies chatted as they drank their tea.

“Suddenly, Old Lady Feng changed the topic, she continued, “Little sister, since we are all one family, I shall not speak of two families. Qianhua has been waiting for your Jin city for nineteen years, it’s not like she can’t get married! It’s not that I’m bragging. As long as she is willing to agree, the people who want to marry her can line up from four or nine cities to the neighboring C City! Youth is priceless. I was thinking, shouldn’t your Jin city give Qianhua an explanation?” ”

Some things should be exposed.

“Otherwise, Feng Qianhua would be at a disadvantage. ”

“”Mom!”Feng Qianhua quickly stood up and said anxiously, “What are you talking about! I was the one who was willing to wait for Brother Jin Cheng! All of this has nothing to do with Auntie Lin and brother Jin Cheng!” ”

Old Lady Lin raised her hand. “Qianhua! Your mother is right. It’s indeed our Lin family that has delayed you all these years!”

“At this point, Old Lady Lin raised her head to look at Old Lady Feng. “Elder sister, don’t worry. Qianhua is the chosen daughter-in-law of our Lin family. No matter what, our Lin family will give her an explanation.” ”

“With these words, Old Lady Feng’s heart was finally relieved. “With your words, I don’t have to worry.” ”

She had thought that old Mrs. Lin was just brushing Feng Qianhua off.

Now it seemed that Feng Qianhua really had old Mrs. Lin’s approval.

“In the evening, Old Mrs. Feng proposed to leave. ”

Old Mrs. Lin personally sent her out.

“When she reached the door, she just happened to bump into Aunt Zhang walking into the house. ”

“Seeing Old Mrs. Feng’s aunt Zhang’s face turn pale, she lowered her head and quickly walked to the other side. Her figure soon disappeared into the dense green plants. ”

“Old Madam Feng frowned and lowered her head to look at Feng Qianhua. She asked, “Who was that person just now? Why does she look so familiar to me?” ”

“Feng Qianhua looked over and said nonchalantly, “She’s just a servant. Perhaps you’ve seen her the last time you were here.” ”

Old Madam Feng nodded. She felt that it was possible.

“”What’s wrong, elder sister?”Old Madam Lin turned to look at Old Madam Feng. ”

Old Lady Feng shook her head. “Nothing.”

…

At the same time.

Yun Jing.

Ye Zhuo received an electronic invitation from the technology industry.

They invited her to participate in the latest science and Technology Conference.

“At the same time, Ye Zhuo also received thousands of blood letters from ‘sons’. ”

“[ father, I beg you to participate in the science and Technology Conference! ] ”

“[ father, I won’t say anything else. Just two words: Science and Technology Conference! ] ”

“[ dad, I guess you must have received an invitation letter by now. Kneel and beg to participate! ] ”

“[ dad, if you don’t participate in the Technology Conference, your sons won’t be able to hold their heads up high in the future! ] ” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“[[ screenshot jpg ] dad, look at how your sons are being bullied by outsiders! Kneel and beg to participate! ] ”

Ye Zhuo clicked on the first screenshot.

The screenshot showed that an account with the ID of Hua ran XR mocked Niu Hu Lu · YC for being a team dog. The number of likes in the comments had exceeded a million.

The sons who defended her under the comments were all painted as dogs.

The second screenshot was a single account name.

Niu Hu Lu · yr.

“Ye Zhuo raised her eyebrows slightly. Although many people used Niu Hu Lu as the prefix of their accounts, apart from those high-quality fake accounts, this was the first time she had seen an ID that was one word different from her account name. ”

“Moreover, she subconsciously felt that there was something wrong with this account. ”

Ye Zhuo manually searched out this account.

“In a short while, she found all the true information about Niu Hu Lu · yr. ”

She looked at the information displayed on the screen.

“Ye Zhuo slightly curved her lips, and her eyes were overflowing with color. ”

Who Did she think YR was.

It was Mu Yourong.

Ye Zhuo began to search for Mu Yourong’s recent browsing traces.

She quickly discovered that she had been frequently paying attention to the topic of the science and Technology Conference.

It seemed that Mu Yourong would like to attend the science and Technology Conference.
