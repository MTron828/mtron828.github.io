Hold a wedding?

“Bai Jingshu was stunned. She thought she was hearing things. After a while, she looked at Bai Jiasheng and asked, “Dad, what do you mean?” ”

“Bai jiasheng smiled and said, “Don’t tell me you want to keep the Chen family in suspense? That’s enough! It’s counterproductive. It’s not a good thing to provoke Chen Jinyan!” The Chen family had already agreed to three boxes of Star Energy’s betrothal gift. One couldn’t be too greedy! ”

“At the end, Bai Jiacheng sighed and said, “Jingshu, you have a brain! It was mom and Dad who misunderstood you in the past. It was mom and Dad’s fault!” ”

Bai Jiacheng was a little regretful now. He regretted that he didn’t care about his eldest daughter in the past.

What if Bai Jingshu married into the Chen family and stopped giving them gifts?

“Right now, Bai Jiasheng desperately wanted Bai Jingshu to forgive him. ”

“No matter what, he was still Bai Jingshu’s father. ”

“No matter which angle she looked at it from, Bai Jingshu should properly honor them. ”

“Bai Jingshu sorted out her thoughts, looked up at Bai jiasheng, and said, “Dad, are you saying that I should settle the matter peacefully and go to the police station to withdraw the case, and marry Chen Yaosheng?” ”

“At this moment, Bai Jingshu felt a chill all over her body. She was clearly in the middle of summer, but it was as if she was in the middle of winter. ”

She was the victim and had almost been raped by Chen Yaosheng.

“However, her father did not care about her at the first moment. Instead, he put his interests first and asked her to withdraw the case and marry a criminal. ”

Ridiculous.

Truly ridiculous.

“If she had not experienced it herself, Bai Jingshu would never have believed that there was such a father in the world. ”

“Although she already knew Bai Jiasheng’s answer, she still hoped that Bai Jiasheng would reply that she was not like this. ”

Bai jiasheng nodded. “That’s right. Don’t you think so?”

“You’ve already done it. Why are you still pretending?”Bai jingfei snorted coldly.

“From Bai Jingfei’s point of view, Bai Jingshu had spared such a big circle in order to smoothly marry Chen Yaosheng. ”

The Chen family’s threshold was too high for an ordinary person to climb up to?

“If Bai Jingshu did not use some tricks, would the Chen couple come personally? ”

It was impossible!

Bai Jingfei was dying of jealousy.

“She had always thought that she was prettier and smarter than Bai Jingshu, and that she would be more promising than Bai Jingshu in the future. ”

But Now?

“In terms of getting married, she was much shorter than Bai Jingshu. ”

“In the future, no matter how successful she was, she would never surpass Bai Jingshu! ”

Bai Jingfei could not wait to grit her teeth. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Bai Jingshu stood up from her chair. “Dad, I never thought of that! Chen Yaosheng is a demon who tried to rape me! How could i marry a demon who tried to hurt me?” ”

The atmosphere at the dining table became strange.

Bai Jiasheng had a complicated expression on his face.

Zhou Ying frowned. “Then what do you mean? Do you really want Chen Yaosheng to stay in prison for ten years?”

“This is a matter for the court. The sentence will be as long as the court sentences him!”Bai Jingshu said.

“Bai Jiasheng looked up at Bai Jingshu. “That’s enough! Don’t look for trouble. The Chen family has already come to us to beg us. What else do you want?”To Bai Jiasheng.., since the Chen family had come to beg them on their own accord and had proposed to marry Bai Jingshu, it was already a huge pie for Bai Jingshu. ”

“Otherwise, how could the Bai family take a liking to someone like Bai Jingshu? ”

“Speaking up to this point, Bai jiasheng continued, “Go to the police station tomorrow and close the case! Your mother and I will handle the rest!” ”

“”What if I don’t go?”Bai Jingshu’s expression was unclear. “Forcing your daughter to marry a devil. Dad, are you really my biological father?” ”

It would be a lie to say that she wasn’t sad.

“As a daughter, Bai Jingshu also hoped that her father would stand up for her when she was injured. ”

“Even if he didn’t stand up for her, it would be good to comfort her. ”

But what about Bai Jiacheng?

“For the sake of fame and fortune, Bai Jiacheng wanted to push her into the fire pit. ”

“You have to go!”Bai Jiacheng said firmly.

“”I won’t go,”Bai Jingshu said. ”

“Zhou Ying was furious when she heard this. “Damn girl, what did you say?” ”

“Bai Jingshu looked at Zhou Ying and said word by word, “I said, I won’t go. Chen Yaosheng deserved it!” ”

“Zhou Ying stood up from her chair and glared at Bai Jingshu. She raised her hand and was about to slap her, but was stopped by Bai family Sheng. ”
