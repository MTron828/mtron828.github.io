“Indeed, no culture means no culture.”

“Zhou cuihua said, “What’s the matter? Do you look down on your mother? Or do you think that your mother can’t compare to Xia Xiaoman?””

“”Mom, that’s not what I meant. I also don’t think that you can’t compare to Xia Xiaoman. I just think that you sometimes think things are too simple,”li hang continued, “Think about it. How many days have you known boss Wang? What makes you think that he will definitely marry you?””

“At this point, Li Hang paused, then he said, “You have to know that there are many young and beautiful girls in this world who are younger than you and have higher education than you. They have many advantages over you. “Even if boss Wang really likes you today, it doesn’t mean that boss Wang Won’t like others tomorrow. “Mom, you have to be aware of the crisis.””

Li Hang thought a lot. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

This was also the reason why she was reluctant to move her household registration.

“Because she knew that once she moved her household registration, it would hurt Li Dalong’s heart. If she wanted to move back in the future, it would be difficult.”

“”I don’t know what crisis awareness is. I only know that your uncle Wang only likes me now,”Zhou cuihua continued, “It’s easy for you young people to think too much. According to what you said, Lin Qingxuan should have liked other people back then, but why did she like Xia Xiaoman? “What right does Xia Xiaoman have to compete with those young college students?””

“Zhou cuihua only knew that she was better than Xia Xiaoman. If Xia Xiaoman could marry a rich businessman, then she could!”

“No matter what, she was ten times better than Xia Xiaoman, a hundred times better!”

“Li Hang was speechless by Zhou Cuihua’s words. He could only say, “Mom, I’ve already told you what I should say. You should be more careful.””

“Actually, Zhou Cuihua had her own reasons.”

“Xia Xiaoman, who was married for the second time, could marry a rich man. Logically speaking, Zhou cuihua could too.”

But Li Hang couldn’t believe it.

Especially since boss Wang didn’t come to pick up Zhou cuihua tonight.

It was obvious that he didn’t put Zhou Cuihua in his eyes.

But Zhou Cuihua was still unaware of it.

“Zhou cuihua continued, “Hang Hang, It’s okay if you don’t believe me now. One day, you’ll know that Mom’s feeling isn’t wrong. Boss Wang is a person worthy of being entrusted with his life. He’s many times better than your dad!””

“”Mom, I also hope that you can successfully marry boss Wang.”Li Hang took out the car keys from his bag and continued, “Where is that boss Wang’s Home? Let me navigate.””

“Zhou cuihua said, “Wang Ting Courtyard.””

Wang Ting Courtyard.

Li Hang knew about this neighborhood.

It was a famous wealthy district in the capital.

Many famous celebrities lived there.

“Zhou cuihua continued, “Do you know how much the Wang Ting courtyard costs per square meter?””

“I do.”Li hang nodded.

“Not to mention the unit price of the property, just the property fee alone was as high as 3,000 yuan per square meter.”

“What did 3,000 yuan mean?”

“The house prices in some small counties were not even 3,000 yuan per square meter.”

“Therefore, there was a saying online that even if someone gave you a house in the Lookout Pavilion, you would not be able to afford the high management and property fees.”

“Zhou cuihua smiled and said, “In the future, ask your uncle Wang to buy you a house in the gazebo courtyard as well.””

“”Mom, you’re Dreaming!””

“Zhou cuihua said, “How do you know that I’m Dreaming? This kind of thing can not be guaranteed.””

At least she was now in boss Wang’s eyes.

“Boss Wang had been single for so many years, but there had never been a woman who could truly enter his heart.”

She was the first.

And also the last.

“Li hang continued, “Just because he doesn’t want to pick you up.””

Zhou Cuihua didn’t say anything.

“Li hang continued, “Today is his mother’s birthday. We can understand that he’s very busy, but there are so many chauffeurs in his family. If he really has you in his heart, he can arrange for a chauffeur to pick you up! But what about him? He doesn’t! So, Mom, don’t give him any excuses.””

“Zhou cuihua continued, “He is a man, how can he think so much as you? We should think from his point of view. Don’t you young people often say something? About that...”speaking up to this point.., zhou cuihua thought for a moment and then said, “Think from another’s point of view! Yes, that’s the word! You usually use it so naturally. How come when it comes to me, you have completely forgotten?””

“”You haven’t figured out the crux of the problem at all.”Li Hang opened the car door and said somewhat helplessly, “This isn’t a problem of thinking from another’s perspective.””

“Just as Zhou Cuihua was about to say something else, a figure walked over from the side.”
