“Auntie Wu poured the water and handed it to the old lady. Then, she said, “Oh right, don’t you like to drink coffee? I’ll go make you a cup of coffee.” ”

“After saying that, auntie wu shouted, “Tingting! Come over quickly!” ”

Yang Ting ran over from outside. “What’s Wrong?”

“Go make coffee for the old lady!”Auntie Wu said.

“Okay.”Yang Ting nodded.

“Auntie Wu reminded, “Remember to add sugar and milk. The old lady doesn’t like to drink coffee that is too bitter.” ”

“Got it.”Yang Ting ran over to make coffee for the old lady.

The mother and daughter were very busy. They wanted to leave a good impression on the old lady and successfully inherit the inheritance of the old lady as well as the National Treasure of the Song Dynasty.

“As long as this matter was successful, they would be the cream of the crop in the future, and they would no longer have to look down on anyone. ”

“All of this was seen by the old man. After a long time, he let out a long sigh. ”

“When she was young, her husband died young, and she had never married. ”

“It was not easy for her to raise her daughter to adulthood, but when it was time for her to retire, her only daughter actually did such a thing. ”

“Now, she had no one to rely on in the country and could only live according to the looks of the nannies. It must be ironic! ”

Which family’s old people would end up like her?

“However, even if things had turned out like this, she did not regret not going to C nation with them. ”

“Just as she said, even if she died, she would die on the land of China. ”

She was born a Chinese.

She died a Chinese soul.

“As for Feng Qi, she would take it that she had made the wrong bet and bet on the wrong person in her life. She had never had this daughter. ”

“The reason why things had turned out this way was because she, as a mother, had failed to teach her daughter well! ”

She could not blame anyone else!

...

Beijing University.

“Under the call of her teacher, Ye Zhuo came to the school and entered the laboratory to conduct experiments with her classmates. ”

She only came to the laboratory once in a very long time. Her classmates were all very excited and fought to take a photo with her so that she could sign it.

“After completing the experiment, she came out of the laboratory. ”

“Li Yueyue hugged ye Zhuo’s arm. “Da Zhuozhuo, you’re finally back! You have no idea how much I’ve missed you these past few days!” ”

“Really?”Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly.

“”Of course it’s true!”Li Yueyue continued, “Right, there’s a new rice noodle shop in the back street of our school. Let’s go and eat it, okay?” ”

“Sure.”Ye Zao nodded slightly. “I still want to eat the desserts of Xu Ji. I haven’t eaten them for a long time.”

This was what Li Yueyue admired most about ye Zao.

“Although ye Zao was now a famous big shot in the science and technology world, he didn’t put on any airs in front of his classmates. It was as if she had never been special. She was the same as all of his classmates. ”

Unlike some people who acted high and mighty just because they were famous.

The two of them chatted as they walked toward the back street.

The back street was a paradise for the students.

“There were all kinds of delicacies here, and they were all good and cheap. ”

“Ye Zao had not visited the back street for more than a month. He wanted to eat whatever he saw. After walking for a while, he already had a lot of delicious food in his hands. ”

“Like Ye Zao, Li Yueyue was also a foodie. ”

“”By the way, Yueyue, do you have a boyfriend?” ”

“Li Yueyue shook her head and said with a smile, “No. Why? Are you going to introduce him to me?” ”

“”Don’t tell me. I really do have one,”ye Zao said. ”

“Really?”Li Yueyue looked at ye Zao in disbelief.

Ye Zao was not a person who liked to set people up.

He did not expect that he would introduce her to a boyfriend this time.

This was even rarer than the red rain falling from the sky. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“”Really,”ye Zhuo continued, “If you have this idea, I will set you up.” ”

“”Who is it? Is he handsome?”Li Yueyue was a complete beauty lover. “If he is handsome, I will consider it.” ”

“He’s quite handsome. Let me show you the photo.”Ye Zao took out his phone.

“Previously, Zhou Yuelian had sent Lin Weiwei’s photo to ye Zao. ”

Ye Zao found the chat history and forwarded it to Li Yueyue. “I sent it to your phone.”

“Let me take a look.”Li Yueyue took out her phone.

“The young man in the photo had delicate features and handsome looks. It made people feel comfortable just by looking at him. However, after all, there was a layer of screen between them, so no other problems could be seen. ”

Who would fall in love with a photo at first sight?

“Li Yueyue continued to ask, “What’s his name?” ”

“”Lin Weiwei. Shuangmulin, Weiwei from maintenance. He’s currently in graduate school. He’s 23 years old this year. What do you think?”Ye Zao said. ”

“He looks quite handsome in this way. I just don’t know how he looks in real life.”The beauty camera nowadays was too powerful. The young hunk in the photo might turn into an old bacon in real life.
