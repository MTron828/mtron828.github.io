Bai Jingshu nodded. “Sure.”

“Bai Jingshu was a writer and had a lot of free time. As long as Lin Ze made the arrangements, she would have no problems. ”

“Lin Ze continued, “Then we’ll go back the day after tomorrow.” ”

“Okay.”

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “Then I’ll go back and make some preparations. I’ll let you guys bring some specialty products back.” ” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“The S galaxy was too far away from Earth. Bai Jingshu would only go back once in a very long time, ”

“therefore, every time she went back, Ye Shu had to prepare a lot of things for Bai Jingshu to bring back. ”

“Perhaps the things were not too precious, but courtesy was important. ”

“Bai Jingshu turned to look at ye Shu and said, “Mom, you don’t have to be so polite. Every time we go back, you have to prepare a bunch of things.” ”

“”There’s no pile!”Ye Shu smiled and said, “We’re all family. It’s our duty to prepare something for the old man.” ”

“Bai Jingshu held ye Shu’s arm, her eyes filled with happiness. ”

She felt that she was very lucky to have met such a good mother-in-law like ye Shu.

The group walked out of the hospital entrance.

The driver also drove the car over at this time.

“Ye Zhuo suddenly received a message and said, “Dad, Mom, brother, sister-in-law, you guys go back first. I still have something to do.” ”

“Why don’t we wait for you for a while?”Ye Shu said.

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “It might not be a matter of a short while. You guys go back first.” ”

Lin Jincheng was a little worried. “Why don’t I accompany you?”

“”No need, Dad. I can do it alone.”Ye Zhuo continued, “I’ll get Cen Shaoqing to pick me up later.” ”

“Lin Jincheng was initially worried, but when he heard Cen Shaoqing’s name, he was relieved. He smiled and said, “Okay, then come back soon.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Seeing the nanny van disappear into the night, Ye Zhuo turned around and walked into the hospital. ”

“Just as he stepped in, doctor Liu ran out. ”

He was sweating because he ran too fast.

“”Doctor Liu, what happened?”Ye Zao asked. ”

“Doctor Liu continued, “Weiwei suddenly fainted!” ”

“”Fainted?”Ye Zao frowned slightly. Obviously, he did not expect Weiwei to suddenly faint. ”

“Yes.”Doctor Liu nodded.

“Ye Zao continued, “Let’s go and take a look first.” ”

The two of them walked towards the inpatient department.

“Soon, they arrived at Wei Wei’s ward. ”

Doctor Liu pushed open the door.

“A voice suddenly came from inside. “Doctor Liu, why are you here again?” ”

“Doctor Liu looked up and saw Wei Wei sitting on the bed, eating while looking at him. ”

The air was still filled with the spicy and hot fragrance.

“Doctor Liu said in surprise, “Wei Wei, didn’t you just, didn’t you just faint?” ”

“Weiwei smiled and said, “I’m fine.” ”

“Ye Zhuo walked to Weiwei’s side and said, “Let me take a look.” ”

“Okay.”Weiwei nodded and reached her hand out in front of ye Zhuo.

Ye Zhuo focused on listening to her pulse.

“A moment later, she continued, “It’s not a big problem.” ”

Doctor Liu stood at the side and scratched his head. “But she clearly fainted just now.”

“Wei Wei looked at Ye Zhuo. “Miracle Doctor Ye, can I continue eating my spicy Hotpot?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“”Thank you, Miracle Doctor Ye.”Compared to the others who didn’t let her eat this or that, Ye Zhuo was simply an angel. ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “If you feel any discomfort, remember to tell doctor Liu immediately.” ”

“She paused and continued, “Then, in order to cooperate with tomorrow’s examination, don’t eat after nine o’clock tomorrow morning.” ”

“Okay.”Weiwei nodded.

Ye Zhuo turned to look at Doctor Liu. “Let’s go.”

Doctor Liu followed ye Zhuo’s footsteps.

“Even when he walked out of the ward, he still felt very strange. “Weiwei clearly fainted just now!” ”

“Ye Zhuo did not answer him directly. Instead, he asked, “Is Weiwei accompanied by her family members?” ”

“”No.”Doctor Liu was more familiar with Weiwei’s situation. He continued, “Other than the day she was admitted to the hospital, her family members never showed up.” ”

“What about the usual payment?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“Doctor Liu continued, “Speaking of which, it’s the little girl who has done her best. Don’t look at her age. In fact, she’s a little famous manga artist. Every month, she receives tens of thousands of dollars in royalties. Her medical fees are all directly deducted from the royalties.” ”

“I see.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“After saying that, ye Zhuo added, “Pay more attention to her condition tonight.” ”

“Okay.”
