Translator: 549690339

“Although it had only been three short days, Old Master Bai’s heart was empty. It felt as if a century had passed. ”

“He knew that Bai Jingshu had returned home today, so he had been waiting at the door. ”

“At that moment, he heard footsteps outside the door. ”

Old Master Bai’s eyes lit up. He immediately stood up from his chair and walked out to welcome her.

“Grandfather.”

This voice didn’t belong to Bai Jingshu.

Elder Bai looked up and saw that it was Bai Mo..

“Miss Mo.”the smile on elder Bai’s face didn’t change when he saw Bai mo. “Why are you here so early?”

“Bai Mo held a gift in her hand. “I knew that my sister and brother-in-law were returning home today, so I came back early to see them. After my sister goes to Earth this time, I’m afraid she’ll have to wait for a long time before she can come back, right?” ”

Bai Mo’s heart ached as she smiled happily.

“If she hadn’t given Lin ze away, Lin Ze would be hers now, and she would be the one returning home with him. ”

Damn Bai Jingshu.

“What made Bai Mo the most upset was that she couldn’t express her anger directly yet. Instead, she had to smile at Bai Jingshu, the person who had stolen her boyfriend. ”

Elder Bai nodded. “Jingshu has a lot of things to do when she goes back this time. She probably won’t be back for at least half a month.”

“”That’s why I have to find some time to spend with my sister,”Bai Mo said. ”

“Elder Bai had always known that Bai Mo had special feelings for Ye Han. He didn’t know that Bai Mo already had other thoughts for Lin Ze, so he didn’t think too much of her words. ”

“In fact, when one grew old, they were quite willing to see the younger generation live in harmony. ”

“Elder bai continued, “Alright! I reckon that your sister and brother-in-law will be arriving soon.” ”

“Okay.”Bai Mo nodded.

On the other side.

“Bai Jiacheng and Zhou Ying were also feeling very uncomfortable. Today was Bai Jingshu’s Day to return home. Under normal circumstances, Bai Jingshu would definitely bring Lin Ze directly to their house, but Bai Jingshu had already severed all ties with them, today, Lin Ze and Bai Jingshu would definitely return to the old mansion. ”

Zhou Ying felt that something was wrong. She turned to look at Bai Jiacheng. “Why don’t we...”

“Before she could finish her sentence, Bai Jiacheng saw through her thoughts. “You mean we should go and stop them on the way?” ”

“They definitely couldn’t go back to the old mansion. After all, the old master wasn’t someone to be trifled with. ”

“If they really angered the old man, he would do anything. ”

“Zhou Ying nodded, “Although your father is unkind, Jingshu is our biological daughter after all. We are their parents. Moreover, Jingshu’s personality is soft. If we sell ourselves out and cry a few times, she will definitely forgive us in front of our son-in-law!” ”

“As a mother, Zhou Ying knew Bai Jingshu too well. ”

“Bai Jingshu’s personality was as soft as mud, and she was especially gullible. When that time came, wouldn’t she be at their mercy? ”

“Hearing this, Bai Jiacheng narrowed his eyes. “Alright, that’s it!” ”

“Other than this method, there was nothing else they could do. ” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Zhou Ying immediately stood up. “I’ll arrange for the Flying Transport.”

“Okay.”Bai Jiacheng nodded. “I’ll go with you.”

“Looking at their backs, Bai Jingfei walked out and frowned slightly. ”

“Bai Jingshu was really unlucky. It was not easy for her to leave her family and marry a good husband. Now, she was being pestered by her parents. ”

No.

She had to send a message to Bai Jingshu. She could not let Bai Jingshu be deceived again.

“With this thought in mind, Bai Jingfei sent a message to Bai Jingshu to remind her to be careful. ”

“However, there was no response from the other end of the communication device. ”

Bai Jingfei was a little anxious. She didn’t know whether Bai Jingshu had received it or not.

“After Zhou Ying lined up the flying devices, she boarded the flying devices with Bai Jiacheng and waited on the way to Bai Jingshu and Lin Ze’s old residence. ”

“Not long after they arrived, they saw Lin Ze and Bai Jingshu’s flying devices. ”

Zhou Ying was very excited. “Look! That’s Jingshu and her son-in-law’s aircraft!”

“This couple was quite a weirdo. They had always treated Lin ze as a lowly person, but now that they knew that Lin Ze was the future heir of the Shangguan family, they called him their son-in-law. They were even closer than their own sons. ”

“Seeing that the aircraft was getting closer and closer, Bai Jiasheng immediately reached out to intercept it. ”

“Inside the aircraft, Lin Ze frowned slightly and turned to look at Bai Jingshu. “The one in front looks like your parents.” ”

“Bai Jingshu walked over, but there was no obvious change on her face. ”

“Lin Ze continued, “Let’s just go around it.” ”
