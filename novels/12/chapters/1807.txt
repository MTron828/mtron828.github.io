Ye Zhuo took the black tea.

The warm black tea entered her throat. She felt much better and her thoughts became clearer.

“Seeing that she seemed to be in a much better state, little white continued, “Big Burning, Are You Alright?” ”

“I’m fine.”Ye Zhuo handed the empty Teacup to little white.

“Little White continued, “But I see that your condition isn’t quite right.” ”

“Xiao Bai tilted his head and said, “Do you need to see a Doctor?” ”

“Ye Zhuo chuckled, “Have you forgotten that I’m a Doctor?” ”

“But didn’t you earthlings say that doctors don’t treat themselves?”Xiao Bai asked.

“”Don’t worry, I’m Fine,”ye Zhuo said. ”

“Are you really fine?”Xiao Bai was very worried. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“I’m really fine.”

“Little White said worriedly, “Then what if you die?” ”

Ye Zao:”...”he was most afraid of the child’s sudden filial piety.

“”I won’t die,”ye Zao said. ”

“Really?”Little White asked.

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

But Little White was still a little worried.

“Because since it knew ye Zao, it had never seen ye Zao like this. ”

This feeling was very strange.

“If it was before, the first thing ye Zao would do when he woke up in the morning was to look in the mirror. ”

“The second thing he would do was to say, “Why am I so beautiful!” ”

But today...

Something was definitely wrong.

“”Da Zao Zao, why don’t I get the Doctor to come over and take a look at you?”Xiao Bai said. ”

“No need.”Ye Zao pressed his temples. “You can go down and play. I need to change.”

“Okay.”Xiao Bai nodded. She glided towards the door and soon arrived at the elevator.

Ye Zao lifted the Duvet and walked towards the changing room.

Her changing room was very large. It was 30 square meters in size and was filled with beautiful clothes.

Ye Zao stood in front of the clothes rack and chose a light purple coat.

“Purple was a color that matched her skin. Her skin was already very white. At this moment, it was as white as jade and soft and delicate. ”

“After changing, ye Zao walked out of the changing room. ”

“At this moment, there was a knock on the door. ”

“”Zao Zao, are you inside?”Ye Shu and Lin Jincheng’s voices came from outside. ”

“”Yes, Mom and dad, you can come in,”ye Zao replied. ”

“Soon, the door was pushed open from outside. ”

Lin Jincheng and ye Shu walked in from outside.

“As soon as ye Shu walked in, she reached out and touched ye Zao’s forehead. ”

Lin Jincheng looked at ye Zao nervously.

“Seeing this, ye Zao asked curiously, “Dad, Mom, What’s Wrong?” ”

“Ye Shu said, “I heard from Little White that you’re not feeling well! Zao Zao, are you okay?” ”

“Lin Jincheng immediately said, “What’s wrong with you? Do you have a headache or a stomachache? Or what’s the matter?” ”

Ye Zao had always been a very independent and self-reliant girl.

“After being acquainted with her mother and daughter for so long, Ye Shu had never seen ye Zao feel uncomfortable. ”

“Ye Zao had always been an optimist. Even if something really happened, she did not want to trouble others. Hearing Xiao Bai say that ye Zao was uncomfortable, Ye Shu and Lin Jincheng were extremely anxious. They immediately put down their work and came upstairs to see her. ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Dad, Mom, you don’t have to be nervous. I’m fine. I’m fine everywhere. Don’t listen to Xiao Bai’s scaremongering!” ”

“Ye Shu said, “Zao Zao, it’s said that doctors don’t treat themselves. If you’re not feeling well, hurry up and go to the hospital! You Can’t be delayed!” ”

“Lin Jincheng echoed, “Your mom is right. If you’re not feeling well, don’t force yourself. You have to go to the hospital when you need to go!” ”

“Ye Zao nodded slightly, “Dad, Mom, don’t worry! I know my own body well! “Besides, do I look like I’m not feeling well? “A doctor doesn’t treat himself, which means that the doctor knows his own condition and doesn’t dare to take the risk to give him heavy medicine. That’s why he doesn’t treat himself. “My body is fine, how can there be a saying that I don’t treat myself?” ”

“Hearing her say that, the couple heaved a sigh of relief. “Zao Zao, are you really alright?” ”

“Ye Zao stretched out her hand and spun around on the spot. “Mom, do I look like I’m Alright Now?” ”

“Looking at it like that, it didn’t seem like it. ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Right, what should we eat for breakfast? I’m Hungry!” ”

“Hearing Ye Zhuo say that he was hungry, Lin Jincheng said, “The kitchen has cooked congee with sugar water, crystal shrimp dumplings, and buns. It depends on what you like to Eat!” ”

“Then I’ll go downstairs to eat immediately! You and mom go downstairs first. I’m going to wash up.”

“Lin Jincheng nodded. “OK, then we’ll go down first.” ”
