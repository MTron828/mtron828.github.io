“”Your grandfather is one of the founders of the Shunxi Financial Group,”Aunt Lang said at this time.”

“Really?”Jiang Yan asked in surprise.

“Xi Weiyue, who was hiding in the dark, also narrowed her eyes.”

She had long known that this damn old woman must be related to the Shunxi Financial Group.

But what she didn’t expect was that the ye family’s grandfather was actually the founder of the Shunxi Financial Group.

“With this line, she would be able to stand firmly in the Shunxi Financial Group.”

“With her talent, it was not impossible for her to become famous throughout the financial world.”

“Aunt Lang nodded. “But I haven’t returned to the Shunxi Financial Group for many years. Since Weiyue wants to join the Shunxi Financial Group, then I’ll write a recommendation letter and let her become your grandfather’s successor.””

“Jiang Yan didn’t know what the Shunxi Financial Group meant, but she was very self-aware. She just wanted Xi Weiyue to have the majority of the Shunxi Financial Group. She wasn’t greedy, as long as she could sit firmly in the position of the Ye family’s eldest daughter, she just needed to live a peaceful and wealthy life.”

“Jiang Yan continued, “Mother, I’ll have to Trouble You Then. Sister Weiyue will definitely be very happy if she finds out about this. I’ll go get a pen for you, you can write the recommendation letter now!””

“Okay.”

“When she heard this, Xi Weiyue was so excited that her heart was about to jump out of her chest.”

“Soon, she would become grandfather Ye’s successor!”

“From now on, she would be one of the founders of Shunxi Financial Group.”

“Jiang Yan brought a pen and paper, and Aunt Lang finished writing the recommendation letter. “I’ll take this recommendation letter to elder Zhang of Shunxi Financial Group tomorrow. He’ll arrange for someone to pick up your sister Weiyue.””

“That night, Xi Weiyue told her parents the good news.”

“Yang Jiao was overjoyed. “Weiyue still has a way! She made that crazy woman write the letter of recommendation obediently. From now on, the Shunxi Financial Group in the financial world will belong to our family!””

“Xi Muwen, who had never revealed his emotions easily, was overjoyed too. “Weiyue, from now on, our XI family will rely on you to carry forward!””

“”Don’t worry, Dad!”Xi Weiyue looked up confidently. “I will definitely not let you down!””

“Okay! Okay!”

“The next day, Aunt Lang invited elder Zhang out and personally handed him the recommendation letter.”

“Elder Zhang opened the letter and frowned. “Muddle-headed! Lang Hua, you’re too muddle-headed! Xi Weiyue is Xi Muwen’s daughter. These two father and daughter aren’t good people. How can you recommend her to be the elder’s heir!””

“Aunt Lang said, “Elder Zhang, you’ve misunderstood them.””

“Elder Zhang massaged his temples. “Lang Hua, give me some more time. I’ll definitely find your biological daughter.””

“”Little Half Moon is my biological daughter!”Aunt Lang stood up straight from the chair. “Elder Zhang, if you’re not willing to give me a letter of recommendation, I can go to the financial world myself!””

Elder Zhang Sighed. “As long as you don’t regret it.”

“”Don’t worry, I’ll never regret it.””

“Aunt Lang’s greatest wish at this moment was to find Little Half Moon. Now that she had found her, everything else was just a fleeting cloud to her.”

“After saying that, aunt lang continued, “I’ll have to trouble you with the recommendation letter. I’ll be going back first.””

Elder Zhang looked at Aunt Lang’s back and frowned.

“At this moment, a figure walked in from outside. “Elder Zhang!””

Elder Zhang looked up and saw that it was Cao Wei.

“Cao Wei continued, “I saw Aunt Lang walking over here just now.”” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“”Mm.”At the mention of Ye Langhua, the elder’s frown deepened.”

“Cao Wei sat opposite elder Zhang. “Elder Zhang, I think Aunt Lang’s daughter is already half a month old.””

“Really?”Elder Zhang’s eyes lit up. “Who is the real half a month old?”

“Cao Wei said, “Ye Shu.””

“Who is ye Shu?”The elder asked.

“Cao Wei explained, “Ye Shu is the wife of Lin Jincheng, the head of the Lin family. Right now, I’m 80% sure that ye Shu is Aunt Lang’s daughter. However, I still need the help of the eldest daughter of the Lin family, Ye Zhuo.””

“How did you confirm it?”Elder Zhang asked.

“Cao Wei said, “I found out that although the head of the Lin family, Ye Shu, is from Yun City, she is not the biological daughter of ye Dahai and his wife. Back then, the daughter of Ye Dahai and his wife died in an accident. The neighbors clearly heard the news of her death, but after a few days, ye Dahai’s daughter actually returned... “...”. “...””

“Because of this matter, Cao Wei made a special trip to Yun City.”

“Contact the eldest daughter of the Lin family immediately!”Elder Zhang stood up from his chair excitedly. “I want to see her!”
