“She will come.”Master Yu’s gaze was firm. “She will definitely come.”

“After saying that, master Yu continued, “Since it is a competition, then we have to follow the rules of the competition. There is still one minute left until the time for the assessment. You can not hand out the papers.” ”

“The head examiner raised his hand and looked at his watch. “To be precise, it is 30 seconds. Elder Yu, if your disciple does not appear after 30 seconds, then I can only do it professionally.” ”

“Alright.”

30 seconds passed very quickly.

The countdown began immediately.

Just when everyone thought that ye Zao would not appear.

Beep —

The sensor at the entrance rang.

A slender figure walked in from outside.

White clothes and black pants.

It was extremely cool.

This was.

Ye Zao.

“At the same time, the number on the big screen just happened to be stuck at’1.’ ”

“Seeing ye Zao’s figure, Zheng Zikai let out a long sigh. ”

“Ye Zao Glanced in elder Yu’s direction, then walked to his seat and sat down. ”

“Master Yu stroked his beard and said with a smile, “I told you my disciple wouldn’t run away from battle.” ”

Han Zhen frowned.

She had thought that ye Zao was someone who could judge the situation.

She didn’t expect...

Ye Zao to actually dare to come.

The chief examiner and the other invigilators began to hand out the examination papers.

Liu Caiyi sat in the position of the Vice President of the Chinese Arts Association and smiled at Feng Xianxian.

Feng Xianxian also smiled at Liu Caiyi.

“There were a total of three sets of examination papers, with a total of more than 260 questions. The examination time was 180 minutes. ”

“Ye Zhuo flipped through the examination papers, his expression indifferent. ”

“After the examination papers were handed out, the surroundings were filled with the rustling sound of writing. ”

Ye Zao picked up his pen slowly and began to write.

An hour later.

“Ye Zao put down his pen, pressed the ‘hand in your papers early’button on the table, and then walked towards the audience. ”

“Seeing ye Zao Hand in his papers two hours early, everyone had different expressions. ”

“The other contestants all felt that there was not enough time, after all, there were more than 260 questions. ”

But Ye Zao actually handed in his papers two hours early.

“If she was not the last, who would be the last? ”

“In an hour, even if she wrote randomly, she would not be able to finish all three sets of papers. ”

Ye Zao walked to the audience seats.

Master Yu ignored the strange looks from the others and smiled at Ye Zao. “You’ve finished writing all of them?”

“Ye Zao nodded slightly. “Yes, ten minutes later than expected.” ”

“She had originally thought that she would be able to finish it in 50 minutes. However, she was stuck on the last question for ten minutes. ”

Feng Xianxian had just finished writing the first set of papers in the examination room.

She was not surprised at all when she saw ye Zao leave.

These three sets of papers were very difficult.

“Even for someone like her who had prepared in advance, she felt that they were very difficult to handle. ”

It was normal for ye Zao to retreat after knowing that it was difficult.

“For someone like ye Zao, it would only be a waste of time if he continued to stay in the examination room. ”

Two hours later.

The examination ended.

Thirty instructors from all over the world sat in their respective seats and corrected the examination papers one by one.

Ten minutes later.

This was the news.

“Among the thirty participants, one of them actually obtained full marks. ”

Full Marks?

How many years had it been since a participant with full marks had appeared in the literary world’s examination competition?

It had been fifteen years!

“15 years ago, it was master Yu’s eldest disciple who had gotten full marks. ”

“Since then, no one had ever gotten full marks. ”

When this news came out...

Everyone was in an uproar.

“Liu Caiyi walked up to Feng Xianxian and said, “Xianxian, Congratulations!” ”

“Feng Xianxian had half of the answers. In addition, she was quite talented. ”

It was normal for her to get full marks.

“Therefore, when she heard that someone had gotten full marks, Liu Caiyi immediately thought of Feng Xianxian. ”

At the same time.

Liu Caiyi was also rejoicing that she had not misjudged Feng Xianxian.

If it was someone else.

Could she get a perfect score?

“Feng Xianxian smiled and stood up. “Sister Caiyi, I have to thank you for this.” ”
