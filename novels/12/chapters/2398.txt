“It was easy to cook the noodles. All one had to do was boil the water, add the noodles, boil it again, add some oil and salt, and sprinkle some chopped green onions on it. ”

“However, frying an egg was a little difficult for Bai Mo because if one was not careful, the egg would be fried. Not only that, the oil in the pot would also spill out. ”

“Liu Chao finished frying an egg. After he scooped it out, he gave the pot to Bai Mo and said, “You try frying one.” ”

Bai Mo nodded and imitated Liu Chao. She raised the pot to boil the oil and then knocked an egg into it.

“The moment the egg was placed in the pot, the hot oil instantly exploded. ”

“Bai Mo was so scared that she turned white and screamed. However, Liu Chao, who was eating noodles in the living room, ignored her. ”

Bai Mo had no choice but to think of a solution herself.

“Five minutes later, Bai Mo brought out a fried egg. ”

“Liu Chao continued, “There are still some noodles in the pot. You can eat them yourself. Don’t waste the eggs. Earth is not like the s galaxy, and you are no longer the high and mighty second lady of the Bai family.” ”

“When she heard the last sentence, Bai Mo held the plate tightly. Because she used too much force, her knuckles had turned slightly white. ”

“Even though she was extremely humiliated, Bai Mo still smiled and said, “Okay.” ”

“After saying that, she turned around and went to the kitchen to get some noodles. Then, in front of Liu Chao, she ate the noodles and the failed fried egg. ”

“Looking at Bai Mo like this, Liu Chao was a little surprised. ” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

He didn’t expect Bai Mo to be so tolerant.

It seemed that he had underestimated Bai Mo..

...

On the other side.

At the CEN Group’s base.

“Due to the changes in l continent, Ye Zhuo had been at the base for the past few days. ”

“”Miss Ye, it’s already the fifth day today, but there’s still no movement from L continent.”Worker Xu walked to ye Zhuo’s side and continued, “Do you think that this time, it’s our cup bow and Snake Shadow?” ”

“If L continent really developed an invention that shocked the world this time, then wouldn’t they be the ones to be slapped in the face. ”

Ye Zhuo stood in front of the experimental platform. “How’s the defense line coming along?”

Worker Xu nodded. “It’s almost done. I estimate that it will be completed in three days.”

Three Days?

“Hearing this, Ye Zhuo frowned slightly. “I can’t wait any longer. Try to complete all the defense systems by 12 o’clock Tomorrow.” ”

“Is it that urgent?”Worker Xu asked.

The originally three-day project was suddenly reduced to one day. Such a huge workload was not just for show.

“If this order was given, one could imagine how the people below would react. ”

“Ye Zao continued, “It’s not that there’s no movement in L continent. It’s just that those ignorant people mistook danger for peace.” ”

“Seeing ye Zao like this, worker Xu did not dare to delay. He nodded and said, “Then I’ll do it right away.” ”

“”Go.”Ye Zhuo continued, “Activate the fast flying machine. I will arrive at the scene with you.” ”

“You will go too?”Worker Xu was a little surprised.

“Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “At the critical moment, I will advance and retreat together with everyone.” ”

“Okay.”Worker Xu immediately went to inform everyone.

“Fifteen minutes later, everyone gathered on the Flying Machine. ”

“Although the speed of this aircraft was not as fast as the speed of light on an aircraft carrier, it could still reach a speed of 6,000 kilometers per hour. Because Earth’s energy was limited, ye Zhuo rarely used the aircraft unless it was a critical moment. ”

“Although they could use the aircraft carrier to land on the eight planets to obtain energy, excessive harvesting would cause an imbalance in the Solar System’s energy supply. ”

“In less than an hour, the aircraft landed in the critical mangrove forest of lzhou. ”

The defense line had to be established in the mangrove forest.

“It was equivalent to a transparent glass cover, directly covering lzhou and isolating it from the other countries. ”

The conditions in the mangrove forest were not very good. Ye Zao walked beside a group of men without any hesitation. He could even support his exhausted assistant.

“After inspecting the mangrove forest, ye Zao and the others returned to the nearby base and worked overtime with the technicians from various countries to build a defensive line. ”

“Dr. YC is really amazing!”

“”Sometimes, I even think that she is a man.” ”

“I have the same illusion.”

“...”

The leaders of the various countries’bases stood outside the laboratory and looked at the busy backs of Ye Zao and the others. They could not help but sigh.

Even men probably did not have ye Zao’s creativity.

They saw a miracle in this little girl.

“If a miracle had a name, it would definitely be Ye Zao. ”

“Not long after, footsteps came from outside the door. ”
