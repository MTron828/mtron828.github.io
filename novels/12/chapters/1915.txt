Translator: 549690339

Miss Qiu Di?

“Yi Ling looked at Ye Lan. “You’ve also betrayed us, haven’t you? Why are you doing this to Miss Ye!” ”

Why!

“”No one has betrayed us. It’s just that people can’t always live in the past.”Ye Lan looked at Yi Ling and said, “Little Ling Ling, Miss Ye’s era is already over.” ”

History will change.

Heroes will end.

The era can never belong to one person alone!

The current era is called the autumn flute.

“”Traitors, all of you are traitors!”Yi Ling said with incomparable heartache, “Miss Ye has treated you all so well. Do you all still have a conscience!” ”

“Ye Lan said, “Little Ling Ling, Miss Ye’s death made me sadder than you. But can being sad solve the problem? “Miss Ye’s greatest wish in life was to lead our Chang Yue country to a more glorious future. Now that Miss Ye is gone, we should help miss ye fulfill this wish! “Instead of standing here and doubting this and that!” ”

“Chang Yue country was outside the Milky Way, and its space civilization had reached level 6. ”

“Even though technology was advanced, the universe outside the Milky Way was huge, and there were many planets that were more powerful than Chang Yue country. ”

“If one was not careful, changyue would be swallowed by other planets. ”

“Yi Ling covered her ears and did not listen to Ye Lan’s explanation. She shouted, “Traitors, you are all traitors!” ”

“Yi Ling! Miss Qiu di is really a good person. Please believe in Miss Qiu Di and also Miss Ye’s Choice.”

Yi Ling blocked ye LAN’s words.

Ye Lan shook her head helplessly and went back to report the situation to Qiu Di.

“Hearing this, autumn flute frowned slightly. ”

It seemed that the spirit coat was harder to deal with than she had imagined.

What should she do now?

Should she give up on the spirit coat?

No.

She couldn’t.

“Ye Zao’s armor, the spirit coat, was a witness of an era. Wearing it meant that ye Zao approved of her. ”

“Moreover, the spirit coat was made of top-grade materials. Some of the materials were already extinct. In the entire world, it was impossible to develop an identical armor. ”

It looked like they had to take it slow.

Wasn’t it just a spirit of clothing?

“She could even rope in the eight great clans, so how could she not rope in a tiny spirit of clothing? ”

Qiu Di narrowed her eyes.

...

On the other side.

On the grassland.

“After Cen Shaoqing ate the two pills that ye Zao gave him, the heat in his body decreased significantly. ”

It was calm.

“Ye Zao turned off the computer and turned to Cen Shaoqing. He raised his eyebrows and said, “Do you want another one?” ”

“”No need.”CEN Shaoqing continued, “I’m going to take a shower first.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Fifteen minutes later, Cen Shaoqing came out of the bathroom. ”

“Are you done showering?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

Ye Zhuo hugged the blanket. “You sleep on the bed tonight. I’ll sleep on the sofa.”

“Okay.”

“Okay?”Ye Zhuo was a little speechless. “Why don’t you follow the usual pattern?”

“What rules?”Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips parted.

“Ye Zao continued, “According to the rules of romance novels, at this time, you should be fighting to sleep on the sofa. How can you let a weak woman sleep on the sofa?” ”

“Cen Shaoqing’s tone was low and slightly hoarse. “According to the rules of romance novels, you should give yourself to me tonight.” ”

“Give Yourself to me?”Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly and met Cen Shaoqing’s bottomless phoenix-like eyes. “Are you sure?”

“Cen Shaoqing did not dare to look at Ye Zhuo’s eyes anymore. After the heat had finally subsided, he suddenly came back up. “I’m going to sleep first.” ”

“After saying that, he walked quickly to the sofa. ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled. “Mr. Cen, you seem to have gone to the wrong place.” ” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“”According to the plot of a romance novel, I didn’t go to the wrong place,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

“I’m just joking with you.”Ye Zao walked forward and placed the blanket on the sofa. “Go and sleep on the bed. I’ll sleep on the sofa.”

“”My skin is rough and my flesh is thick. Sleeping on the sofa is just right. You Go and sleep on the bed.”Cen Shaoqing said concisely. As he spoke, he placed the Buddha beads on the sofa, took off his shoes and clothes, and lay on the sofa. He pulled the blanket over him. ”

“Ye Zao continued, “That bed is quite big. Why don’t we both sleep on the bed? Don’t worry, I Won’t touch you.” ”

“The bed was two meters long, one meter for each person. There was definitely enough space. ”

Cen Shaoqing narrowed his eyes slightly. “Go and sleep.”

“You really don’t sleep on the bed?”Ye Zao continued to ask.

“”Good night, leader.” ”

“Seeing him like this, ye Zao didn’t say anything more. “Good night.” ”

“After turning off the crystal lamp, the room fell into silence. ”

“With him around, ye Zao quickly fell asleep. ”

“Little did he know that in the darkness, Cen Shaoqing slowly opened his eyes. ”
