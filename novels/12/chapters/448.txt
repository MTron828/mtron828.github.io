“”Good, good, good!”Old Madam Lin said happily, “I love eating tofu soup made by Qianhua the most!””

“Besides Feng Qianhua, who else would be so filial?”

Aunt Zhang served some tofu soup to old madam Lin.

“After dinner, Aunt Zhang sent Feng Qianhua out.”

The two of them walked one after the other without saying a word.

Only when they left the Lin Manor did Mrs Zhang pick up her pace and walk to Feng Qianhua’s side. “Secretary Zhang has already succeeded.”

“Although she had already made preparations, Feng Qianhua was still a little in disbelief. “Are you sure?””

“Mrs Zhang nodded. “Secretary Zhang’s children are very sick now. Once the old lady asks the old lady to stop taking the medicine, then they will only have a dead end. So you don’t have to worry about other complications.””

That’s great!

That’s really great!

“After waiting for so long, Feng Qianhua finally saw Hope!”

Once she and Lin Jincheng were done with their work...

So what if ye Shu brought the children to her house?

A mistress was a mistress!

A rat crossing the street who could not be seen in the light.

“At this moment, Feng Qianhua’s eyes were full of light. She turned to look at Mrs Zhang and said gratefully, “Thank you! Thank you so much!””

Yes.

Feng Qianhua had deliberately set this up from the beginning to the end.

“When she knew that Lin Jin Cheng needed to rely on the diary to recover his memory, she knew that her chance had come!”

Secretary Zhang had been by Lin Jin Cheng’s side for five years.

Feng Qianhua knew secretary Zhang’s character very well.

She knew that Secretary Zhang would not betray Lin Jin Cheng.

“Otherwise, Lin Jin Cheng would not have trusted secretary Zhang So Much and told his secrets to Secretary Zhang.”

Until...

Something went wrong with Secretary Zhang’s daughters.

“As a parent, they valued their children the most.”

Feng Qianhua knew that Secretary Zhang would definitely not ignore his sons and daughters.

“So, Feng Qianhua thought of using someone else to kill someone else.”

Using old Mrs. Lin’s hands to complete the plan.

“This way, she could complete the plan and continue to leave a good impression in front of old Mrs. Lin and Lin Jincheng, acting as a good wife and mother.”

Killing two birds with one stone.

“Old Lady Lin was Lin Jincheng’s mother, and everything she did was for the good of Lin Jincheng.” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Even if Lin Jincheng knew the truth about the diary being changed in the future, he couldn’t blame her. After all, this matter had nothing to do with her.”

Feng Qianhua knew how much Old Lady Lin liked her.

Old Lady Lin even dreamed of letting her marry into the Lin family.

It turned out that.

Feng Qianhua was not wrong.

And Madam Lin did not disappoint Feng Qianhua.

“So, with the help of Mrs Zhang, Madam Lin naturally thought of changing her diary and found a person who was good at copying other people’s handwriting overnight.”

The person Feng Qianhua was most grateful to now was Mrs Zhang.

Mrs Zhang had been in the Lin family for more than 20 years.

“Aunt Zhang was the person that Old Lady Lin trusted the most. If it weren’t for Aunt Zhang’s advice in front of Old Lady Lin, things wouldn’t have gone so smoothly.”

Aunt Zhang patted Feng Qianhua’s hand. “Of course. It’s dark now. Take care on the road. I’ll let you know immediately if anything happens here!”

“”Okay, thank you.”Feng Qianhua nodded. “Then we’ll keep in touch at all times.””

Aunt Zhang watched Feng Qianhua get into the car and then walked into the Lin Manor.

Old Mrs. Lin sat on the sofa. “Qianhua went back?”

“Yes.”Aunt Zhang nodded.

Old Mrs. Lin looked out the door. “Qianhua is a kind and good child. Don’t tell her about secretary Zhang Changing the diary! I don’t want to burden her!”

“In Old Mrs. Lin’s heart, Feng Qianhua had never been a person who played tricks.”

Because Feng Qianhua was disdainful.

“If she had been scheming, she would have made a move on Lin Jin Cheng long ago. She wouldn’t have waited until now.”

“”Old Mrs. Lin, I know,”aunt Zhang continued, “I watched Miss Qianhua grow up. I know her character. Don’t worry, I won’t tell her a word about this.””

“At this point, a worried look appeared on Aunt Zhang’s face. “Now... If Jin City finds out the truth, will he blame Miss Qianhua?””

“Old Madam Lin said with a straight face, “He won’t! He dares! If he wants to blame someone, he’ll blame me, his mother!””

Aunt Zhang nodded.

“Old Madam Lin Sighed. “Qianhua, this child is too scheming! If I don’t use some means to help her this time, she’ll probably have to wait for her whole life!””

“Therefore, she must not let Feng Qianhua miss this opportunity!”
