Translator: 549690339

“Old Master Chen looked at Bai Jiayu. “Jiayu, tell me, am I an ordinary person to Shiyu?” ”

He had saved song Shiyu on a snowy night.

“If it weren’t for him, there wouldn’t be song Shiyu! ”

It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that song Shiyu owed him a life.

“But now, Song Shiyu had actually rejected his request. ”

“If song Shiyu really wanted to repay his kindness, he should have married Chen Siyao and everyone would be happy. ”

“Old Master Chen seemed to recall the past and continued, “How old was song Shiyu at that time? The child was pitiful. Although he had a father and mother, no one cared...” ”

Even Bai Jiayu found it hard to accept song Shiyu’s words.

What was this?

Trying to repay a debt of gratitude?

Forcing his head down without drinking water?

“”Old Chen, what happened in the past is in the past. We can’t live in the past forever, can we?”Bai Jiayu continued, “I know you owe third brother a debt of gratitude, but over the years, third brother has done a lot for your Chen family. Take the 721 incident as an example. If it wasn’t for third brother, do you think the Chen Corporation would have been able to hold on until now?” ”

“Before this, Bai Jiayu had always thought that old master Chen was a sensible old man. ”

He didn’t expect that...

“As expected, People’s hearts were different! ”

Old Master Chen’s expression didn’t look too good.

What did Bai Jiayu mean by this?

Yes!

“He admitted that over the years, song Shiyu had indeed helped the Chen family a lot. ”

But how could these favors be compared to a human life?

“Although Old Master Chen was a little angry, he didn’t show it, he continued, “Jia Yu, I understand what you mean. Actually, I’m doing this for the sake of time and circumstances. He’s already at an age where he’s suitable for marriage, but he hasn’t made any moves. He can’t stay single forever, right? He grew up together with Yaoyao, so they know each other very well. The two of them are simply a match made in heaven!” ”

Who Wouldn’t song Shiyu marry?

He might as well marry Chen Siyao directly.

“This way, he could repay her kindness and fulfill Chen Siyao’s wish. Killing two birds with one stone, why not? ”

“”But third brother has someone he likes in his heart,”Bai Jiayu said. ”

“Old Master Chen smiled and said, “It’s normal for men. I understand. Yaoyao also understands.” ”

“This was already old master Chen’s biggest concession. Under normal circumstances, how many elders would tolerate their granddaughter’s son-in-law not loving someone else? ”

“Bai Jiayu felt that he was somewhat unable to communicate with old master Chen, he continued, “I understand what you mean, but I still feel that it’s better to respect third brother’s opinion. After all, this kind of matter is like a fish drinking water. We, the bystanders, can’t empathize with it.” ”

“”You don’t understand this, do you? ! This kind of matter has always been a mystery to the bystanders who are clear of the situation!”Old Master Chen continued, “Shi Yu now lacks a person who can enlighten him!” ”

“Once the clouds were cleared and the sun shone, the sky would be clear. ”

“Bai Jiayu stood up and said, “Old Master Chen, I know what you mean. I will pass it on to third brother.” ”

“”I’ll have to trouble you, Jiayu.”Old Master Chen let the servants push him to send Bai Jiayu off. ”

“Walking out of the door, Bai Jiayu stopped and turned to look at Old Master Chen. He said, “Old Master Chen, wait!” ”

“Old Master Chen nodded. “Jiayu, I’m counting on you!” ”

Bai Jiayu didn’t say anything and continued walking forward.

Old Master Chen looked at Bai Jiayu’s back with anticipation in his eyes.

“Song Shiyu wasn’t someone who couldn’t understand things. As long as someone gave him some advice, he believed that he would be able to see reality clearly. ”

Bai Jiayu arrived at song Shiyu’s residence.

Song Shiyu happened to be at home.

“Why are you free today?”Song Shiyu raised his eyes.

“Bai Jiayu smiled and said, “I just went to the Chen family. Guess what Old Master Chen told me?” ”

“It has something to do with me?”Song Shiyu asked.

“”Yes.”Bai Jiayu nodded and continued, “I don’t know what Old Master Chen was thinking. How did an old man who lived to understand suddenly become like this?” ”

“Song Shiyu poured himself a cup of tea and asked, “He asked you to come to the lobbyist?” ”

“”Yes.”Bai Jiayu nodded. “To be honest, I used to think that you and Chen siyao were quite compatible. Now...” ”

He really didn’t expect Chen Siyao to do this. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

It was beyond his expectations.

“”All these years, you’ve helped them so much. Not only do they not know how to be content, they even resorted to extorting favors in return! Aren’t they deliberately trying to disgust people?”Bai Jiayu didn’t know if song Shiyu was angry or not, but he was quite angry. ”

“Song Shiyu continued, “Ignore them.” ”

“Then what do you plan to do next?”Bai Jiayu continued to ask.
