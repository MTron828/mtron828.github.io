“”If you ask me to go out with you, I’ll go out with you. How embarrassing would that be for me?”Ye Zhuo said lazily. ”

“”I’ll tell you one more time. Go Out With Me!”Jiang Xiaoyu rested her hands on the table and said coldly, “Otherwise, you’ll regret it.” ”

“Since she gave him face and ye Zhuo didn’t want it, it wasn’t her fault for being rude. ”

“Ye Zao took a sip of the milk tea and said, “Well, say it again.” ”

“Jiang Xiaoyu repeated, “I said, I’ll let you go out with me. Otherwise, you’ll regret it!” ”

“Say it again.”Ye Zao ate a chocolate bean. He looked so carefree and obviously didn’t put Jiang Xiaoyu in his eyes.

Jiang Xiaoyu was very angry and repeated what he had just said.

“If you have the ability...”ye Zhuo looked up at Jiang Xiaoyu. “Say it again.”

Say It Again!

He really thought that she was afraid of her!

“Jiang Xiaoyu’s face darkened. “I’m going to repeat it one last time. Now, go out with me immediately! Otherwise, don’t blame me for being rude!” ”

“Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly. “Tsk... my good son, you’re so obedient.” ”

Jiang Xiaoyu was stunned for a moment before she realized that ye Zao was trying to trick her!

Too Much!

Too Much!

He was so clever. No wonder he bullied Zhao Xueyin so badly.

“”You usually bully Xueyin like this, right?” ”

Ye Zao couldn’t be bothered with Jiang Xiaoyu and continued eating dessert.

“”I’m Xueyin’s best friend. As long as I’m here, you can’t bully her!” ”

“Ye Zao! Don’t force me to attack you in public! It Won’t look good for everyone!”

“Seeing that ye Zao couldn’t be bothered with her, Jiang Xiaoyu became even angrier. ”

PA —

Jiang Xiaoyu flipped over the dessert in front of ye Zao.

Two pink macaroons rolled to the ground.

“Ye Zao raised his eyes slightly, and a cold light flashed in his eyes. He looked at Jiang Xiaoyu and said, “Pick it up.” ”

Pick it up?

What a joke!

“Ye Zao asked her to pick it up, and she picked it up? ”

Jiang Xiaoyu snorted coldly. “I won’t pick it up. What can you do to me? !” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Three, two, one! ”

“Before Jiang Xiaoyu could react, she was kicked by a gravitational force and fell to the ground. ”

It hurt!

It was very painful.

It was as if all the bones in her body were broken.

“Didn’t your mother teach you to conserve food? I’ll give you one last chance. Pick it up!”

A cold voice came from above.

“Jiang Xiaoyu tried to raise her head and saw that ye Zao was still sitting on the chair like before, looking down at her from above. ”

One of them was sitting while the other was lying on the ground.

“If people who didn’t know saw this, they would think that Jiang Xiaoyu fell down by herself. ”

An inexplicable fear struck Jiang Xiaoyu.

How did ye Zao make his move just now?

It was terrifying.

It was really too terrifying.

She had an intuition.

“If she didn’t pick up the two macarons today, Ye Zao might be able to do anything. ”

“Jiang Xiaoyu used all her strength to pick up the macaron that was closest to her. The top layer of chocolate had already shattered due to the other macaron that fell to the ground. After picking up the two macarons.., jiang Xiaoyu supported herself with the chair and stood up. She carefully put the macaroons back on the plate in front of ye Zao. ”

“”Apologize,”ye Zao enunciated each word. ”

Jiang Xiaoyu gulped. Her voice was trembling. “I’m... I’m sorry.”

“Apologize to it.”

It?

“Jiang Xiaoyu was stunned, although she just realized that the ‘it’that ye Zao mentioned was the two macaroons on the plate. ”

Asking her to apologize to a dessert?

What was ye Zao Thinking?

Was there something wrong with her brain?

How could a normal person say such a thing?

“”Is it glorious to waste food?”The light voice was accompanied by a biting cold, which made people tremble uncontrollably. ”

It was full of dominance.

This ye Zao was completely different from the ye Zao just now.

Jiang Xiaoyu was still a little stunned.

“So, Ye Zao was angry because she wasted food? ”

“After all, Ye Zao didn’t make a move even after she said so many words. ”

“When she flipped the macaron to the ground, ye Zao seemed to have changed into a different person. ”

“After she reacted, Jiang Xiaoyu immediately bowed to the macaron and apologized, “I’m sorry, I’m Sorry!” ”

“Ye Zao opened his red lips slightly and said indifferently, “Get lost.” ”

Jiang Xiaoyu’s heart trembled and she ran forward with trembling legs.

“After she ran out of the danger zone, Jiang Xiaoyu turned around and looked back. ”

This scene made Jiang Xiaoyu somewhat unable to believe it.

She saw ye Zao pick up the macarons that had just fallen to the ground and eat them just like that.

Didn’t she find them dirty?

It was also at this moment that Jiang Xiaoyu realized that ye Zao was really angry because she had wasted food and flipped the macarons to the ground!

“At this moment, Jiang Xiaoyu was a little confused. ”

“A person who could even pick up food that had fallen on the ground and eat it, how bad could her character be? ”

Jiang Xiaoyu grew up in the financial world.

She had never seen anyone who could pick up food that had fallen on the ground and eat it.

Not to mention falling on the ground.

Even the desserts from the previous night were not eaten.

Ye Zao was very different from the people she had met.

Perhaps.

She had a misunderstanding about ye Zao.

Jiang Xiaoyu thought as she walked forward.

This scene also fell into Si Lu’s eyes.

Si Lu was a little absent-minded.

Ye Zao’s action of picking up the things on the floor and eating reminded him of a past event many years ago.

“If it was not for his special experience, it would be difficult for a normal person to do what ye Zao did. ”

Si Lu narrowed his eyes. The expression in his eyes was especially complicated.

“Young Master.”A sudden voice interrupted si Lu’s thoughts.

“Si Lu lowered his head and said in a low voice, “Uncle Fu, why are you here?” ”

“Uncle Fu continued, “I called you but you didn’t pick up, so I could only come here to look for you!” ”

Si Lu frowned. “This is not a place to talk. Come with me.”

The lawyer only wanted to live a normal life.

He didn’t want to make the identity of the eldest young master of the Jin family known to everyone.

Uncle Fu followed the lawyer.

The two of them arrived at the conference room on the fifth floor of the hotel.

“The lawyer closed the door and said with an unsightly expression, “Uncle fu, didn’t I tell you not to come and look for me?” ”

“Uncle Fu Sighed. “Young master, I’m worried that you’ll be cheated! Every inch of time is worth an inch of gold. It’s hard to buy an inch of time. You’ve been delayed by the Shunxi Financial Group for so many years. Do you still want to be delayed by them?” ”

The reason why the lawyer was guarding the Shunxi Financial Group was because of Zhao Xueyin.

“However, Zhao Xueyin didn’t treat the lawyer sincerely. ”

“If the lawyer continued like this, it would only be a waste of time. ”

“The lawyer frowned and said, “Uncle Fu, I’m an adult. I know what I’m doing! You came here today because of that old man, right?” ”

“”No.”Uncle Fu quickly explained, “This matter has nothing to do with master. I came here on my own accord. Young Master, please believe me just this once. Zhao Xueyin is really not worth it for you to do this for her!” ”

“No one is more worth it than her!”
