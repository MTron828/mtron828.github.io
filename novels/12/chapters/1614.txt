“The young woman continued, “Miss Tang, is there anything else you need?” ”

“Bai Yun hesitated for a moment before continuing, “Go and bring me some snacks.” ”

“Alright.”

“Looking at the young woman’s back, Bai Yun’s eyes were filled with shock. She had not expected that Tang Xue’s authority would actually be so great. ”

“However, what Bai Yun did not know was that because Tang Xue wanted to maintain her high status, she rarely came to the dining area to eat with everyone. ” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“After all, there were all kinds of people who came to the restaurant. ”

“And she was just a manager, how could she eat together with these people! ”

“Very soon, the young woman came over with snacks. “Miss Tang, my name is Sun Yue. You Can Call Me Little Sun.” ”

“Okay.”Bai Yun nodded.

“After sitting in the restaurant for a while, Bai Yun met no less than ten people who came to greet her and compete to help her with her work. ”

Bai Yun finally experienced the feeling of being superior to others.

She stayed in the dining area for a period of time.

Bai Yun came to the fitness area on the fourth floor again.

There were many people in the fitness area.

“In the fitness area, Bai Yun was naturally respected by everyone. ”

Bai Yun was extremely proud.

She raised her chin and walked forward arrogantly.

“The position of the treadmill in front was very good. Wherever she went to run, people could see her at a glance. Through the French window, they could also see the scenery of the artificial lake downstairs. ”

“At this moment, a slender figure walked over from the other side. She directly pressed the button and started running on the treadmill. ”

The girl had a bun on her head. She wore a black halter top and black slim pants.

“From the back, her figure was so good that it made people scream. ”

“Black was a very dark color. If her skin was slightly yellow or wheat-colored, it would appear even darker. However, when Black was worn on the girl, it made her skin look as white as a piece of jade. ”

People could not help but exclaim.

How could it be so white.

Bai Yun frowned slightly. This ugly woman was really too bold. She actually dared to steal her things! Did she take a fancy to this treadmill?

It must be intentional!

It was said that a person with a good back view would definitely be extremely ugly in the front. This woman’s back view was so good-looking. Her appearance would definitely be extremely ugly!

Wasn’t there a saying on the internet?

Back View Kill.

Back View Kill referred to this kind of person.

Bai Yun walked to the front and looked at the girl’s back view. She crossed her arms over her chest and looked as though her clothes were high up. “Get Down!”

“In this base, who wouldn’t treat her with respect? Only this ugly person dared to steal her things! ”

She deserved a lesson!

“In a flash, the girl on the treadmill took off the wireless earphones on her ears and turned around slowly, revealing a face that could topple a city. “You called for me?” ”

Bai Yun was stunned when she saw this face.

She never expected that this ‘ugly girl’actually had such a good-looking face.

It was even more stunning than her back view!

“She was pure yet charming, and there was a hint of elegance in her charm. ”

Even the belle of Baiyun School was not as good-looking as her.

“She had plastic surgery, right? ”

“If she did not have plastic surgery, how could she be so good-looking? ”

Right!

She definitely had plastic surgery!

“In this day and age, as long as there was money, what could not be done? ”

“Baiyun narrowed her eyes and continued, “I thought you were deaf! Didn’t you hear me when I told you to come down?” ”

Ye Zhuo did not say anything. He just looked at Baiyun without any expression on his face.

“Seeing that ye Zao did not say anything and did not come down, Bai Yun was angry. was this person challenging her bottom line? ”

“Did he really think that just because he had a pretty face, he could run amok in the base? ”

“”What are you still standing there for? I told you to come down! Why Are You So Blind? Do you believe that I Will Fire You?”When she said this, Bai Yun puffed out her chest. ”

On her chest was Tang Xue’s work badge.

She thought that ye Zhuo would immediately change his attitude when he saw Tang Xue’s work badge. He would call her Miss Tang and apologize to her.

She did not expect ye Zhuo to have no expression on his face.

“Tang Xue?”Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly. “District D’s Administrator?”

“Bai Yun curled the corners of her lips and said smugly, “You know who I am. Hurry up and come down!” ”

“Ye Zhuo pressed on his earpiece and said softly, “Have Liu Luo come to fitness area B.” ”

“Okay.”A reply came from the other side.

Bai Yun narrowed her eyes.

She felt that something was not right.

“When the others saw Tang Xue’s work badge, they were all respectful and respectful. Why did this little girl not show any respect at all, but instead, she told the air to make a trip here? ”

Who was staying?

Could it be that this little girl knew Tang Xue?
