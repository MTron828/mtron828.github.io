Translator: 549690339

Ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing arrived at the airport together.

There were a total of eight seats in the first-class cabin.

“But until the plane took off, the other six seats were empty. ”

Ye Zhuo took out the phone case he bought at the Night Market Yesterday and prepared to change the case of the phone.

“When he opened the package, he found that there was also a phone case of the same model inside. ”

“Ye Zao looked at Cen Shaoqing. “I remember that our phones are of the same model, right?” ”

Cen Shaoqing took out the phone. “I think so.”

“Then this phone case is yours.”Ye Zao handed the phone case to Cen Shaoqing.

Cen Shaoqing took the pink phone case and fell into deep thought.

The phone case was not only pink.

It was also inlaid with diamonds and pearls that girls liked.

Did girls like pink that much?

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “If you don’t like it, you can give it to Grandma Cen. I remember that Grandma Cen’s phone model is the same as mine.” ”

“”No, I like it very much.”As he said that, Cen Shaoqing put the phone case on the phone. ”

“When the pink phone case was put on the phone, the phone immediately looked brand new. ”

Ye Zhuo deliberately teased him. “You should change the lock screen to a pink background as well. It’ll look better this way.”

Cen Shaoqing did not reply and looked down at the phone.

“Just as ye Zhuo thought Cen Shaoqing was angry, Cen Shaoqing suddenly handed the phone over. “What do you think of this one?” ”

It was a pink picture that had the heart of a young girl.

Ye Zhuo looked up in surprise. “You really changed it? I was just joking with you.”

“Cen Shaoqing said in all seriousness, “Actually, I’ve always liked pink.” ”

“Really?”Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows in surprise.

“Really.”Cen Shaoqing nodded.

“Ye Zhuo saw that he did not seem to be lying, so he nodded and said, “This one is pretty good.” ”

A grown man actually liked pink. No wonder he wanted to become a monk after seeing through the secular world.

She really didn’t agree with his aesthetic standards.

Cen Shaoqing set this picture as a lock screen.

“Five hours later, the plane landed at Yunjing Airport. ”

It was already past three in the afternoon.

The two of them had just walked out of the airport.

Ye Zhuo saw a familiar figure.

Was It song Shiyu?

Ye Zhuo looked up at Cen Shaoqing. “Wait for me here for a moment. I saw an acquaintance go say hello.”

“Alright.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Ye Zhuo jogged to song Shiyu’s side and greeted, “Brother Song.” ”

“Upon seeing ye Zhuo, a look of surprise flashed across song Shiyu’s eyes. “Ye Zhuo, you’re here to pick someone up as well?” ”

“Ye Zhuo shook his head. “I’ve just returned from the capital. Brother song, are you here to pick someone up?” ”

“Yes.”Song Shiyu nodded.

“Ye Zhuo continued, “My friend is still waiting for me there. I Won’t talk to you anymore.” ”

“Alright.”Song Shiyu swallowed the rest of his words.

Ye Zhuo walked towards Cen Shaoqing.

Song Shiyu raised his eyes slightly.

“Just like that, his gaze met Cen Shaoqing’s. ” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

His eyes turned slightly cold.

Both of them could see the viciousness and threat in each other’s eyes.

“After a moment, CEN Shaoqing withdrew his gaze and looked back at Ye Zhuo. “Have you greeted him?” ”

Ye Zao nodded. “Yes.”

“Then let’s go.”

Ye Zao followed Cen Shaoqing out.

Song Shiyu narrowed his eyes as he watched the two of them leave.

A moment later.

He also turned around and walked out of the airport.

Picking her up was just a cover.

Picking her up was the true purpose.

What song Shiyu did not expect was that there would be an uninvited guest by her side.

Mu Yourong had just walked out of the airport.

She saw a figure in the crowd that made her scalp tingle and her limbs go soft.

It was song Shiyu.

“Although it was just a figure, Mu Yourong recognized it at a glance. ”

That’s right.

It was him!

Mu Yourong hurriedly hid in the bathroom at the side.

She could not let song Shiyu discover her!

Absolutely Not!

Why would song Shiyu appear at the airport?

Was he there to stop her?

“But in this life, the person who provoked song Shiyu was not her at all. ”

Could it be that song Shiyu was here to stop ye Zao?

That’s right!

It must be ye Zao!

“Thinking of this, Mu Yourong heaved a sigh of relief. ”

That’s right.

How could she forget song Shiyu?

“With song Shiyu around, Ye Zao would not be able to live in peace! ”

Song Shiyu would definitely kill ye Zao.

Mu Yourong secretly glanced outside the door.

Song Shiyu’s figure had already disappeared.

“But just in case song Shiyu had not gone far, Mu Yourong stood in the bathroom for another ten minutes or so before walking out. ”

“When Mu Yourong returned to the Mu residence, she called her assistant upstairs. ”

“”Miss, do you have any orders?” ”

A sinister look appeared in Mu Yourong’s eyes. “Find a few local ruffians to serve ye Shu and take a few photos to send to Ye Shu’s friends and family.”
