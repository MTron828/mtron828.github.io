“”It’s not that you don’t recognize me as your granddaughter, but I don’t have a grandmother like you who is blind and doesn’t know people well.”Ye Zao smiled slightly. “The road is just over there, take care, Old Lady.” ”

Old Lady Lin choked and was almost angered to death by Ye Zao.

She said that she didn’t recognize ye Zao as her granddaughter just to scare ye Zao.

She did not expect ye Zao to call her old lady in the blink of an eye.

“Old Lady Lin wanted to say something more, but ye Zao’s figure had already disappeared from the dormitory building. ”

“After ye Zao returned to the dormitory, he sent a message. ”

“Then, he came to a Qing bar. ”

The environment of this Qing bar was very good. There was a cellist performing live in the middle of the stage.

“”Goddess!”At this moment, a surprised female voice sounded in the air. ”

Ye Zao looked back slightly and saw a young woman with a good figure and a beautiful face.

“Shuya.”

“Wang Shuya hugged ye Zao excitedly. “Goddess, long time no see.” ” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Long time no see.”

“Not only was Wang Shuya a loyal fan of ye Zao, but she was also a good partner of Ye Zao. ”

“After the two of them sat down, Ye Zao handed the wine list to Wang Shuya. “What do you want to drink? Order it yourself.” ”

“Wang Shuya smiled and said, “Goddess, then I won’t stand on ceremony with you.” ”

“No need to stand on ceremony.”

“Wang Shuya ordered a cocktail and continued, “Goddess, you called me out this time. Is there something you want to tell me?” ”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “There is indeed something I want to trouble you with.”

“”What is it? Tell me.”Hearing that ye Zhuo wanted to trouble her with something, Wang Shuya was especially excited. ”

“In her opinion, ye Zao was almost omnipotent. Now that ye Zao had something to ask her for help, it was also a form of recognition for her. ”

Ye Zao drank a mouthful of wine. “I want to ask you to help me put on a show.”

“”Put on a show?”Wang Shuya smiled and said, “I’m good at this! What kind of show does the goddess want to put on? Do you have a script?” ”

“Although Wang Shuya looked young, she was actually already 39 years old, almost 40 years old. ”

She had previously been a movie queen in the entertainment industry.

“She had debuted as a child star and became famous at 15 years old. When she was 35 years old, she retired from the entertainment industry. ”

“Although she had retired from the industry for four years, the legend that belonged to her in the entertainment industry was still there. ”

“Ye Zhuo nodded slightly, took out his phone, and handed it to Wang Shuya. “Take a look at this.” ”

“Wang Shuya looked at the phone and smiled. “Feng Xianxian, right? Alright, no problem. Leave it to me!” ”

“Originally, ye Zhuo did not want to make a move against Feng Qianxian. ”

“After all, they were not to interfere in each other’s business. ”

But now...

“Looking at Old Lady Lin’s appearance, she probably had no choice but to make a move. ”

“If Old Lady Lin continued like this, something would happen sooner or later. ”

“Then I’ll have to trouble you.”Ye Zhuo raised his cup towards Wang Shuya.

“It’s my honor.”

...

Feng Qianxian had a serious illness.

She was very ill.

She was bedridden and could not get out of bed.

“Old Lady Lin’s heart ached for her. She had taken care of Feng Xianxian in the apartment for two days straight. “Xianxian, are you still feeling unwell?” ”

“Feng Xianxian shook her head and said weakly, “I’m not unwell, Grandma. It’s been hard on you these past few days. If it weren’t for you, I’m afraid that no one would even know that I’ve died here.” ”

The word ‘die’made Old Lady Lin’s eyebrows jump.

She couldn’t help but feel even more sorry for Feng Xianxian.

This child had a tough life.

“She didn’t have a good mother, and the tenant was even worse. ”

“As she thought about it, Old Lady Lin’s eyes turned red. She felt that she and Feng Xianxian were destined to be the same person. ”

“She was sick and uncomfortable, and no one cared about her. ”

“As her biological granddaughter, Ye Zao was also a doctor. For such a long time, he had never cared about her, nor did he visit her once. ”

“They lived under the same roof, but ye Zao seemed to be thousands of miles away from her. ”

“Old Lady Lin was really afraid that one day she would die at home, and no one would know. ”

Feng Xianxian’s words were really mean.

A short sentence had made Old Lady Lin think so much.

In fact.

Feng Xianxian did it on purpose.

Just yesterday.

She met a master by chance.

“Under the guidance of a master, she took a cold bath and turned on the electric fan to make her cold worse. ”

Because she knew that old Mrs. Lin would never ignore her.

Her goal now was to live in the Lin Family!

Only by living in the Lin family could some plans be implemented.

“The Lin family, including this damn old woman. ”

They all deserve to die!

All of them deserve to die!

“If it weren’t for the Lin family, if it weren’t for ye Zao, she wouldn’t have become like this. ”

She should be the Lin family’s eldest daughter with boundless glory.
