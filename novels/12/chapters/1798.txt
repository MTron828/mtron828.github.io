“The next second, Father Yu opened his eyes. ”

“Looking at Yu Zifei in front of him, Father Yu was stunned for a moment. ”

Yu Zifei!

It was Yu Zifei who had returned.

“”Zi, Zifei?”Father Yu said in a hoarse voice. ”

“Dad!”

“Zifei!”

“Seeing that Yu Zifei was fine, Father Yu’s tears instantly rolled down. ”

“During the time he was unconscious, Father Yu had many dreams. ”

“He dreamed that Yu Zifei had disappeared, and then Tian Zhifang went crazy! ”

And he searched day and night for Yu Zifei.

“Year after year, but he still couldn’t find Yu Zifei. ”

“How desperate he was in the dream, how excited he was now. ”

Very excited!

This kind of excitement couldn’t be described with words.

“Yu Zifei could return safely. This was a happy occasion. Father Yu didn’t want to cry, but he couldn’t help it. ”

“Beside him, Tian Zhifang’s eyes were also a little red. She continued, “Okay, okay, you two father and son, Don’t Cry! Especially you, Old Yu! Didn’t you always say that a man shouldn’t cry easily? Are you embarrassed?” ”

“”I still have something to say,”father Yu said. ”

“What is it?”Tian Zhifang asked.

“”It’s just that it hasn’t reached the point of sadness.”A man shouldn’t cry easily, but it hadn’t reached the point of sadness. ”

“Tian Zhifang smiled and said, “Isn’t our Zifei Fine Now?” ”

Father Yu wiped his eyes.

“Tian Zhifang continued, “Are you still not feeling well? If you’re not feeling well, I’ll get doctor Zhang to come over and take a look at you.” ”

“”No, no! I’m Fine Now!”Father Yu said with a smile. ”

“As long as he saw that Yu Zifei was fine, Father Yu would be fine from head to toe. ”

“”Dad, are you really fine?”Yu Zifei asked. ” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“”I’m really fine! I Can Jump Now!”As he said this, father Yu even stood up and gave Yu Zifei a jump. ”

“Seeing that Father Yu was fine, Yu Zifei heaved a sigh of relief and continued, “Dad, Mom, I’ll go to Miss Ye’s place first.” ”

“”Okay, you go ahead.”Tian Zhifang nodded. ”

Yu Zifei left the lounge and went to Ye Zao’s office with the report.

“Ye Zao had not slept for five days and five nights. Although there was a hint of tiredness on her face, it did not affect the beauty of her facial features. ”

“This tiredness not only did not slow her down, but it also added to her charm. ”

She was checking the landmarks on Mars.

“At this moment, the doorbell rang in the air. ”

Ye Zhuo pressed the button to open the door.

Yu Zifei walked in from outside the door. “Miss Ye.”

Ye Zhuo put down the work in his hands and looked back. “You’re here.”

“Yes.”Yu Zifei nodded.

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Have you brought the inspection report?” ”

“I have.”Yu Zifei handed the report to Ye Zhuo.

“Ye Zao took the report and looked at it. After a while, his red lips parted slightly. “I don’t see any major problems at the moment. You should rest well when you go back.” ”

“Okay.”

“Ye Zao put down the report and continued, “Team leader Yu, did you feel anything strange before you jumped?” ”

“Yu Zifei nodded. “There seemed to be a creature attacking my aircraft, but the smoke was too big, so I didn’t see it clearly.” ”

“What kind of smoke?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“Yu Zifei continued, “I’m not sure exactly what kind of smoke it is. In short, the density is very high, and the visibility is less than one meter. The strangest thing is that the smoke came very suddenly, as if it appeared suddenly.” ”

“Hearing this, Ye Zhuo frowned slightly. ”

How could this be?

Could it be...

There really were aliens on Mars?

“But in her memory, there were no aliens on Mars at all! ”

What was going on?

Could it be that she remembered wrongly?

“At this moment, ye Zao felt a fierce pain in her head. ”

It was very painful.

It was as if someone had taken an axe and ruthlessly cut her head.

Ye Zao pressed on her temple.

“Seeing ye Zao like this, Yu Zifei was shocked and immediately asked, “Miss Ye, Are You Alright?” ”

“”I’m fine.”Ye Zao raised his hand slightly and continued, “I’ll definitely investigate this matter! In addition, I’ll give you a two-month vacation from assistant Xiao Li. During this period of time, you should rest well at home and accompany your parents.” ”

“Yu Zifei smiled and said, “Thank you, Miss Ye.”Ever since she started working, Yu Zifei rarely rested. Even when it was a statutory holiday, she worked overtime. ”

Taking two months off at once made Yu Zifei especially excited.

“”It’s my pleasure,”ye Zhuo said. ”

“After leaving ye Zhuo’s office, Yu Zifei went to Li Xiang’s place and told him about the holiday. ”

“Hearing this, Li Xiang said excitedly, “Really?” ”
