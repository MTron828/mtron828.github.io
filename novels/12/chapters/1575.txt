“After saying that, old Mrs. Cen turned to look at the butler and said, “Go quickly! Go and bring his third aunt into the house!” ”

“Okay! I’ll go now!”The butler nodded.

“Wait!”Old Mrs. Cen stopped the butler. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“The Butler turned to look at old Mrs. Cen, “Do you have any other instructions?” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen put on her coat and said, “His third aunt hasn’t come for a long time. I’ll go with you to pick them up!” ”

Old Mrs. Cen went out with the housekeeper.

“They were two kilometers away from the entrance of the manor, so they had to take a car. ”

“It was cold. If it weren’t for the fact that the person who came was of the same generation as Old Mrs. Cen and they had a friendship when they were young, old Mrs. Cen wouldn’t have been willing to go out personally to pick them up. ”

“Soon, the car stopped at the entrance of the manor. ”

Old Madam Cen pushed the door open and got out of the car. She walked to third aunt’s side and held her hands. “His third aunt! We haven’t seen each other for decades!”

“Third Aunt’s eyes were red as she sobbed, “Yes, yes!” ”

“Before she came, third aunt had been very nervous. The Cen family was no longer the CEN family of the past. ”

And she was just a poor old lady with a burden. She was afraid that the Cen family would ignore her.

She did not expect that Old Lady Cen would personally come to pick her up.

“Old Lady Cen continued, “This capital is colder than our old home! Quickly get in the car! Oh right, who is this child?” ”

“The third aunt said, “This is Shuanzi’s child! His name is tianshun. Tianshun, quickly call him ancestor!” ”

“Zhou Tianshun hid behind the third aunt and held the corner of the third aunt’s clothes tightly. His eyes were full of restraint and fear, and he did not dare to call anyone. ”

“Seeing that Zhou Tianshun did not call anyone, the third aunt said angrily, “You child! Quickly call someone!” ”

“Only then did Zhou Tianshun speak slowly,”... Zu, Zu zu, Hello.” ”

“Old Granny Cen smiled and touched Zhou Tianshun’s small face, “Good, good, good! is this Sanma Zi’s grandson?” ”

Zhou Tianshun hid behind in fear.

“Yes.”The third aunt nodded.

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Quickly get in the car. This is not a place to talk. Let’s talk at home.” ”

The third aunt got in the car as well.

Zhou Tianshun immediately picked up the snakeskin bag and got in the car with her.

He was too small to carry a big snakeskin bag.

“Seeing this, the housekeeper quickly took the snakeskin bag and carried Zhou Tianshun into the car. ”

“Looking at the scenery on the road, the third aunt’s eyes were filled with amazement. ”

“Having lived for more than half her life, she had never seen such a scene. ”

“While she was amazed, the third aunt was also a little nervous. She tightly held Zhou Tianshun’s hand. Although she had long known that the CEN family was now a wealthy family, she did not expect the CEN family to be this rich. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen took the initiative to open the conversation. “Third aunt, is the child’s grandparents still well?” ”

“Hearing this, the third aunt sighed. “No, one has liver cancer and the other has leukemia. They left a long time ago!” ”

Old Mrs. Cen was stunned.

“After saying that, the third aunt continued, “Tianshun is not lucky. The shuanzi couple left less than two years ago, and the days are slowly getting better. However, the child’s parents, my poor grandson and granddaughter-in-law, actually got into a car accident and left!” ”

“Hearing this, Old Mrs. Cen could not believe it. “How, how could this be?” ”

The third aunt gave a wry smile. “Perhaps this is fate!”

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “So now it’s just you and the child?” ”

“”Yes.”The third aunt nodded. “When the child’s parents left, he was only three years old. Now that I think about it, I don’t know how I survived that period.”Now, she really could not endure it any longer, only then did the third aunt think about coming to the Cen family. ”

Old Mrs. Cen couldn’t help but sigh. She also felt a little uncomfortable in her heart.

“At the third aunt’s age, when she was officially enjoying her life, she was suffering a lot. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “The child’s parents left in a car accident. Didn’t the perpetrator pay some money?”Looking at the third aunt and the child’s clothes, it didn’t seem like they were well-off. ”

“The third aunt shook her head. “No, the perpetrator ran away.” ”

“Did you call the police? What did the police say?”Old Mrs. Cen continued to ask.

“The third aunt said, “We called the police.”. But because it happened in the middle of the night and there were no cameras on the rural roads, the police couldn’t find anything. What a pity for the child’s parents! The forensic doctor said that if they had called 120 on the spot, the couple wouldn’t have died. It was winter at the time of the accident, the temperature outside was minus 10 degrees Celsius. The car accident that happened at 9 pm was only discovered at 9 am. It took more than 10 hours. By the time 120 arrived, they were already frozen stiff! ”
