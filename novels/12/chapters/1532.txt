Translator: 549690339

China had always been a country of etiquette since ancient times.

“No matter what purpose Dr. Cara and the others had, they were all guests who had come from afar. She should treat them well and bring them to appreciate the local customs of China. ”

“Dr. Cara said, “Will it be too troublesome for Dr. YC?” ”

“”It’s no trouble.”Ye Zhuo made a ‘please’gesture. “Everyone, follow me.” ”

The group of people followed ye Zao’s footsteps.

There was already an extended Lincoln waiting outside the door.

Ye Zao and a few professors sat in the back seat.

The car drove quickly.

“Professor Cara asked curiously, “I wonder where Professor YC is taking us?” ”

“Ye Zao said, “There’s an old saying in China, ‘a man is not a man until he reaches the Great Wall’. I’ll take you to the Great Wall to have a look first. It snowed a few days ago, and the scenery on the Great Wall is very good now.” ”

“”Good!”Hearing that, Kara said with some excitement, “Is it the Great Wall, one of the Seven Wonders of the World?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“Hearing that, Dr. Tina, who was beside him, immediately said, “I saw the Great Wall on TV! The Great Wall is one of the greatest buildings in the world, magnificent and magnificent!” ”

“Ye Zao continued, “The TV can only show a corner of the Great Wall. Only by standing on the Great Wall in person can one truly experience the wisdom of the Ancients and the majesty of the Great Wall!” ”

“How much longer do we have?”Dr. Tina could not wait any longer.

Ye Zao looked at his phone. “About 15 minutes more.”

Dr. Tina nodded.

“The car was quite fast. After 15 minutes, the car stopped in the parking lot. ”

Ye Zao got out of the car first.

“Led by Dr. Cara, everyone got out of the car. ”

“Is this the Great Wall?”Orvis asked.

“”This is the parking lot, and we still have to walk some distance to the entrance of the Great Wall.”Ye Zao continued, “Everyone, come with me.” ”

The few of them followed ye Zao’s footsteps. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“As Ye Zao walked, he told everyone about the history of China, about the first emperor, and about the allusion to the Great Wall. ”

“After listening to ye Zao’s introduction, Jamila, who had been silent all this time, said, “I know about this first emperor of Qin. He is a famous tyrant in the history of your country!” ”

It was said that Qin Shihuang was a tyrant of a generation.

He had fallen to his death and killed two younger brothers of the same mother but different fathers. He burned books and scammed scholars. He had laboriously built the Great Wall!

“However, Ye Zhuo did not think so. Although she was born in an era with advanced technology, she had seriously understood Qin shihuang. She believed that the descendants had a great misunderstanding of Qin shihuang. ”

Almost everyone would think of two words whenever Qin Shihuang was mentioned.

Tyrant!

“Ye Zao said calmly and smiled, “In fact, the real Shi Huang is not a tyrant, but an emperor. Without Shi Huang, our China would not be what it is today.” ”

“Jamila looked at ye Zao with confusion, “Although I don’t know much about the history of your China, I know a little about Shi Huang’s atrocities, such as killing the younger brother of a mother and burying the scholars alive, including the construction of the Great Wall.” ”

“In the ancient times where there was nothing, it was easy to imagine how much it would cost to build a great wall of ten thousand miles! ”

“After saying that, Jamila continued, “I also heard that there were white bones buried under the Great Wall. The actions of the first emperor of Qin had separated many families and destroyed them!” ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “If the first emperor had not unified the six countries and unified the characters, our country would have been in a state of disunity, just like Europe now! From the fact that the books are the same language, the cars are on the same track, and the paths are the same, it can be seen that this is not the pattern of an ordinary person!” ”

Jamila was stunned for a moment.

“He did not understand anything else, but when it came to the disunity of Europe, he could empathize with it. ”

“In other words, it was because of the absence of a figure like Qin shihuang that Europe had developed into the situation it was in today? ”

“Not only was Jamila stunned, but the others were also stunned. ”

“”Then how do you explain the death of his younger brother, burning books to burn scholars, and building the Great Wall?”Jamila asked in return. ”

“Ye Zhuo explained, “The death of his younger brother was because the empress dowager at that time, who was also the emperor’s biological mother, Zhao Ji, had an affair with the imperial attendant. She also gave birth to two illegitimate children and attempted to usurp the throne! “From the perspective of modern people, the methods used were indeed very cruel. However, that was ancient times after all. From the perspective of the first emperor, it was reasonable! “As for burning books and scamming scholars, there were other insider information. It was recorded in the historical records that at that time, burning books and scamming scholars had killed less than a hundred people. Moreover, most of these people were charlatans! “The burning of books was also because of the corrupt scholars’malicious words! “But because of this incident, it was written up by the later scholars and exaggerated the facts. It was spread among the people of the six kingdoms. After all, the first emperor unified the six kingdoms. “He unified the six kingdoms. The people of the six kingdoms felt that they had become slaves of the conquered kingdoms, so they naturally didn’t have a good impression of him.” ”
