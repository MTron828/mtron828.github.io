“At present, only butler-type robots in the country had such intelligence. ”

“No!”Little White carried water and walked to Cen Shaoqing’s side. “It’s just a cleaning robot!”

“Ye Zhuo nodded. “Yes, it’s just a cleaning robot.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing:”? ? ?”Nowadays, even cleaning robots could serve tea and chat with each other? ”

“After sitting in the Ye residence for a while, Cen Shaoqing proposed to leave. ”

“Just as he walked out of the apartment building, he saw the young couple just now standing in the pavilion by the side, watching the two old men play chess. ”

“However, from where they were standing, they could see the windows of the Ye residence at a glance. ” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly, picked up his phone, and sent a message. ”

“After that, he sat in the car, started the engine, and left. ”

...

On the other side.

At the MU residence.

Mu Yourong had been doing missions on the technology website for the past few days while keeping a close eye on ye Zao’s situation.

Ye Zao’s situation was getting more and more abnormal. The Ye Zao in her previous life was clearly a dumbass!

But now!

“Not only did he steal her position in the live streaming world, he also stole her college entrance examination champion position! ”

“If this continued, ye Zao would definitely surpass her radiance and steal more things that belonged to her. ”

“Has song Shiyu made any moves?”Mu Yourong asked the system.

“Ye Zao was getting more and more out of control. If they wanted to get rid of her, they could only rely on song Shiyu, that demon. ”

Only song Shiyu could make ye Zao die an even more miserable death!

“Thinking of her death in her previous life, Mu Yourong laughed out loud and felt extremely happy. ”

But there was one thing that Mu Yourong felt was not quite right.

“In her previous life, not long after she had met song Shiyu, song Shiyu had already made a move on her. ”

Why did song Shiyu not make a move in this life?

Could it be that he was playing cat and mouse with ye Zao?

“After all, Song Shiyu’s entire person was abnormal, abnormal and sinister. ”

Blood and struggle could make him excited.

“The system said, [ this system has just checked. Not only did song Shiyu not make any movements, he even arranged for people to protect ye Zao. ] ”

“”Protect?”Mu Yourong frowned and said in disbelief, “Are you sure it’s not surveillance?” ”

If song Shiyu had arranged for people to protect ye Zao.

She would not have died so tragically in her previous life!

“So, this was definitely not protection, but surveillance! ”

“The system continued, [ I did not find any danger value on these people, so it’s protection, not surveillance. ] ”

“”That’s impossible!”Mu Yourong stood up from her chair, “You must have made a mistake! Song Shiyu is a devil, he wouldn’t be so kind to protect ye Zao! It must be surveillance!” ”

“In her previous life, she had died so tragically, why did it become protection for ye Zao? ”

The system must have made a mistake.

Maybe song Shiyu wanted to play a big game!

He wanted ye Zao to die even more tragically.

[ the system won’t make a mistake. ]

“Mu yourong said, “You seem to have made a mistake more than once, right? The last time at the live broadcast of Miao Yin’s Gala, you said that my chess skills were unrivalled, but in the end, I still lost to ye Zao!” ”

The system suddenly fell silent.

Even it did not think of that incident last time.

“After a while, it continued, [ host, I feel that ye Zao is not as simple as you think. You should focus on the technology world! Don’t create trouble for yourself! ] ”

“”No! Ye Zao Must Die! Song Shiyu will definitely kill her!”Speaking up to this point, a sinister glint appeared in Mu Yourong’s eyes. ”

At this moment.

Voices came from downstairs.

It was followed by a sigh.

These were the voices of soldier Mu and Shen Rong.

Mu Yourong frowned slightly. She suddenly thought of something.

“In her previous life, the Mu Corporation had probably encountered an unprecedented financial crisis at this time. ”

“Later, it was song Shiyu who helped the MU Corporation to tide over the crisis. ”

“At that time, Mu Yourong thought that song Shiyu really had feelings for her. ”

“Otherwise, why would song Shiyu suddenly lend a hand? ”

“At that time, Song Shiyu was an omnipotent God in Mu Yourong’s eyes. ”

She loved him so much that she lost her rationality.

“In this life, song Shiyu’s gaze was attracted by Ye Zao. ”

Ye Zao was about to become her in her previous life.

She was no longer song Shiyu’s prey. Song Shiyu would definitely not save the Mu Corporation for no reason.

Without song Shiyu.

She had to think of a way to save herself!

She could not let the MU corporation fall just like that.

“Whether it was in her past life or this life, Mu Yourong did not have much talent in business. At this moment, the best method she could think of was to ask the system for help. ”

“”System, what should I do?” ”

“[ host, I just searched for a new industry, ZY Corporation. ] ”

“ZY Group? Is it the ZY group that produces adjustable temperature clothes?”

“[ yes. ] The system sounded a little excited, [ I didn’t expect the humans here to be so SMART! ]! [ even such high-tech technology has been invented. I’ll give you a plan now. Take this plan and go find the mysterious boss behind Zy. I’m sure he’ll be very interested in working with you! ]! ‘once you cooperate with ZY Group and gain Zy’s boss’s appreciation, you’ll be able to resolve the MU group’s financial crisis!’ ”

“Alright.”

“After resolving this matter, Mu Yourong hurriedly went downstairs. ”

“After not seeing soldier Mu for several days, he seemed to have aged more than ten years. ”

Mu Yourong felt a little guilty.

“These past few days, she had only been paying attention to that little slut ye Zhuo, and had instead neglected the people closest to her. ”

“Dad.”

“”Yourong.”Seeing his most precious daughter, soldier mu forced a smile. ”

“Mu yourong continued, “Dad, did something happen to the company?” ”

Soldier Mu was stunned. “How did you know?”

“Mu Yourong took out a bank card and continued, “This is the money I earned as a streamer. You can use it to deal with the emergency! You Don’t have to worry about the rest. Just leave it to me.” ”

Soldier Mu’s eyes lit up. “You have a way?”

“Mu yourong nodded and said, “Do you know ZY Group?” ”

“”I know!”Soldier Mu continued, “ZY group is especially powerful. It’s a dark horse in the industry! It’s said that the boss behind the scenes is worth more than 12 figures!” ”

“In the current business world, everyone knew about Zy. ”

Zy was a legend in the business world and the technology world!

“Mu yourong continued, “I have a way to get ZY’s behind-the-scenes boss to cooperate with us.” ”

Big Soldier Mu frowned. “ZY’s behind-the-scenes boss is very mysterious. He hasn’t even shown his face when the group went public. Are you sure you can get them to cooperate with us?”

“Mu yourong smiled and said, “I naturally have a way to meet him and gain his appreciation. You can just wait patiently for ZY to cooperate with us! Don’t tell me that you still don’t believe in your daughter’s ability?” ”

“Not only would she be able to meet ZY’s mysterious boss behind the scenes, she could also make him fall in love with her at first sight and fall in love with her. ”

She could make him willingly give up everything for her!

“Mu Yourong was confident for a reason. Currently, there were not many top female entrepreneurs in the business world. ”

She was beautiful and had an advanced plan in her hands.

CEO Zy had no reason to not like her!
