Chapter 2061: 428: she is Miss Ye! 1

Translator: 549690339

“From the beginning of Ye Zhuo’s memory, she was a child without a home. ”

“Standing on the busy street, she also longed for her parents to take her little hand and bring her home. ”

Her wish was very simple.

She had a small home.

“A small home did not need to be luxurious, it could hide from the wind and rain. ”

She really did not want to continue wandering.

God knows how much she envied those children who had a home to return to.

“One day, she saw a child of the same age standing on the street and arguing with her mother because of an interstellar car. At that time, she thought that if one day, she also had parents.., she would definitely not quarrel with her parents. ”

She would be a good girl.

“That kind of feeling, perhaps only children who did not have a home would understand. ”

“Because of these experiences, ye Zhuo was much more mature than other children her age. ”

“Every day, she hoped that her parents would find her and bring her back. ”

Because the feeling of wandering was too unbearable.

“To be precise, the feeling of starving was really unbearable. ”

She did not want to continue wandering.

But this wish could only be realized in a dream.

When she woke up from her sleep.

She was still the wild child that no one wanted.

“But after a very long time, she did not wait for her parents. ”

Later.

“When she was older, she began to hate her parents. ”

She hated them for abandoning her.

She hated them for turning her into a street child.

What kind of parents were they if they did not raise her?

“She secretly swore that even if her parents found her, she would no longer recognize them. ”

Until she met her grandmother.

“She was not related to her grandmother at all, but her grandmother treated her better than her own granddaughter. ”

Her grandmother gave her her name.

She gave her her household registration.

She went from a little orphan that no one wanted to become a child with a name.

Her name was ye Zao.

“When a peach is young, it burns its splendor. ”

Her grandmother told her that burning represented hope and represented the revival of all things. She hoped that ye Zao would blossom into his best self in his best years and live up to his youth and the people who loved her.

“In order to be able to reunite with her parents as soon as possible and to repay Grandma’s kindness in raising her, ye Zao forced herself to become stronger. She began to learn medical skills, learn ancient martial arts, and enter a research institute... ”

“Unfortunately, such a warm life did not last long. ”

Grandma soon passed away.

“When Grandma passed away, she held her hand and told her not to hold grudges against her parents. ”

There was no parent in this world who did not love their children.

Her parents must have their own difficulties and did not deliberately abandon her.

“Perhaps, her parents were also looking for her in a corner of changyue. ”

“Therefore, after becoming famous, the first thing ye Zhuo did was to look for her parents. ”

She wanted her parents to see the best of her.

“At that time, it was not difficult for her to find out her background. ”

“She originally thought that from then on, she could gather with her parents and family and feel the warmth of home. ” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“However, the results of the investigation disappointed her greatly. ”

“It turned out that not every child was welcomed by their parents, and not every child could become the heart and soul of their parents. ”

Some children’s birth was a sin.

“From then on, Ye Zhuo buried this matter in the bottom of her heart forever. ”

Beauty alone was the most beautiful.

Ye Zhuo was that ye Zhuo.

The Ye Zhuo who had been wandering around since young and had no parents.

Until...

She had her own parents on Earth and an older brother.

Her whole body began to feel warm.

“Thinking of life on Earth, Ye Zhuo’s brows and eyes curved, and her whole person became distinct. ”

“Zhao Dan was somewhat unable to guess ye Zhuo’s intentions. People said that mother and daughter were linked in heart, but she and Ye Zhuo didn’t even have the slightest bit of tacit understanding. ”

“Perhaps, Ye Zhuo really wasn’t a full moon. ”

“But if she wasn’t a full moon, then who was a full moon? ”

There had never been a person who could give her such a shocking feeling.

“Zhao Dan looked at ye Zhuo and continued, “Miss Ye, what are you saying? You are the role model of all women. If that pitiful child of mine could be half as good as Miss Ye, then I would be satisfied.” ”

Ye Zhuo’s tone was indifferent. “Madam thinks too highly of Ye Zhuo.”

“”Sister.”At this moment, ye Han walked in from the other side. ”

“Oh?”Ye Zhuo looked back slightly.

“Ye Han continued, “There’s a meeting here that needs you to preside over.” ”

“”Okay, I’ll be there right away.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. ”

“After saying that, Ye Zhuo looked at Zhao Dan. “Sorry, excuse me.” ”

“Ye Han seemed to have just seen Zhao Dan as he walked over and said, “Madam.” ”

“Zhao Dan looked at Ye Han and sized him up. After all, he was not related to Ye Zhuo by blood. Although his surname was also ye, the two of them did not look like each other at all. He did not know what ye Zhuo was thinking to actually keep such a person by his side, if it was not for Ye Han, the Ye clan’s base would not have suffered such a calamity. ”
