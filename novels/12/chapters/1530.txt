Chapter 1531: 321: a big gamble! 6

Translator: 549690339

The current Zhang Qingqing was in a dilemma.

One step forward was not enough.

One step back was not enough.

“At this moment, a thought flashed through Zhang Qingqing’s mind, and she quickly grabbed it.”

If...

“If this child was Lin Ze, then would she be able to openly enter the Lin Family?”

Wasn’t there a saying that a mother’s value depended on her child?

“She was already pregnant with a descendant of the Lin family, and those people still dared to neglect her?”

“Thinking of this, Zhang Qingqing narrowed her eyes.”

Whether or not she could successfully marry into the Lin family depended on this gamble.

This life was originally a gamble!

“However, if Lin Ze wanted to think that this child was his, he still had to wait for an opportunity.”

...

On the other side.

Dr. Cara and the other five research doctorates as well as the staff of the International Notary Office came to Beijing with the betting agreement.

“Although they had already signed the electronic version of the agreement, the agreement was still in effect. They had to bring the staff of the notary office to sign the paper agreement in person.”

“”Dr. Cara, do you think YC will renege on the agreement?”Orvis was a little nervous. After all, the betting agreement in their hands would do no good to YC!”

“She has already signed the electronic version of the agreement. Is it that easy to go back on your word?”Dr. Cara said.

“Orvis frowned and continued, “But you also know that the Chinese have never kept their word.””

“Although he had never worked with the Chinese before, from his understanding of film and television, he knew that the Chinese loved to go back on their word.”

“YC is in a tough spot this time!”Dr. Cara said.

“If YC was a newcomer, they could still go back on their word. But YC was not. Not only was it not, but she had personally drafted this agreement. Unless she did not want to be in the technology industry anymore, she would not regret it!”

Orvis nodded and did not say anything else.

Cara looked at her assistant. “Where did you meet with YC?”

“”Dynasty Hotel,”her assistant replied.”

“Okay.”Cara nodded.

“Soon, they arrived at Dynasty Hotel.”

Cara asked her assistant to go to the front desk and wait by her side.

“Her assistant had never been to China before, so she naturally couldn’t speak Chinese. Just as she was in a dilemma, the front desk staff spoke in fluent English, “Sir, is there anything I can help you with?””

He did not expect a small front desk staff to speak English. The assistant was a little surprised. It seemed that China was not quite what he had imagined. After he told them about his problem.

“The front desk staff said enthusiastically, “You are guests of Dr. YC, right? Please follow me!””

The assistant jogged over and called for Dr. Cara and the others.

The group of seven followed the footsteps of the front desk staff.

The elevator went straight to the top-floor conference room.

“”Please Wait a moment, Dr. YC is on his way.””

“Okay.”

“Seeing that a waiter could speak English so well, Cara also raised her head and looked at him.”

It seemed that China was really not the same as before.

“Actually, on the way here, Dr. Cara was quite shocked.”

“About 30 years ago, he had come to China. At that time, China could not be compared to the current China.”

“Dirty, messy, broken!” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Therefore, his impression of China had remained at 30 years ago. He did not expect that the current China had undergone such a drastic change.”

“If he had not seen it with his own eyes, he would not have believed it.”

“At this moment, there was a knock on the door.”

The assistant walked over to open the door.

“The moment the door was opened, a slender figure walked in from outside.”

“The girl looked young. She wore white clothes and black pants, and her eyes were clear. She did not look old, at most 18 or 19 years old.”

This was YC?

“Although Dr. Cara and the others had seen ye Zao on the video, the video was still a video after all. Now, there was beauty and filtering. Before this, they had all thought that it was the effect of beauty and filtering. Who would have thought that YC’s real age.., was even younger than it looked on the video!”
