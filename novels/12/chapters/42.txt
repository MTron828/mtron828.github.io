Chapter 43: Children Take After Their Parents

After visiting the Ye family and seeing Ye Shu, Madam Cen was completely relieved. Ye Shu did not seem like the kind of person who was greedy for money.

Therefore, Madam Cen did not want to hide the truth anymore. She wanted to confess to Ye Zhuo.

Originally, she thought that if Ye Zhuo’s family members were the kind of people who were greedy for money and would even sell their daughter for fame and fortune, she would support Ye Zhuo! She would help Ye Zhuo escape from her family.

Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “Granny Cen, it’s already the 21st century. Why are you still talking about repaying me with your grandson’s body? By the way, where do you live? I’ll call a cab to send you back.”

Madam Cen grabbed Ye Zhuo’s hand. “There’s no need, Ye Zi. My chauffeur will come to pick me up in a while!”

Ye Zhuo was stunned.

She did not take Madam Cen seriously when the old lady mentioned that her family owned a mine. Could it be that the old lady’s family really had a mine?

Madam Cen continued, “Ye Zi, let me tell you something! Our family really has a mine! My eldest grandson is also really handsome! Are you really not going to consider marrying my eldest grandson?”

“Granny Cen, I know you mean well, but I’m still young. I just want to focus on my studies.”

Madam Cen said, “Studying and being in a relationship are two different things. My eldest grandson was known as a super genius when he was still in school. After the two of you fall in love, he can help you with your homework and warm your bed. If he does anything make you unhappy in future, I’ll make sure he kneels and begs for your forgiveness until you’re happy again. It’s a dream come true, just like killing three birds with one stone!”

“Since your eldest grandson is so outstanding, he will definitely meet a better girl.”

“In my heart, Ye Zi, you are the most outstanding girl in the world! Other than you, no one is worthy of my eldest grandson!”

In fact, Madam Cen even felt that Cen Shaoqing was not worthy of Ye Zhuo. Other than having some money, being handsome, and a genius student, Cen Shaoqing had no other merits.

He was not old, but he always carried himself around like an old man. He recited Buddhist scriptures and ate vegetarian food all day long. He was as dull as a gourd!

He was almost thirty years old, but he had not even touched a little girl’s hand. He was like an idiot.

If not for the fact that she liked Ye Zhuo so much, she would not have been willing to marry her to Cen Shaoqing as his wife!

She was really a good grandmother!

She was simply the best grandmother in China!

Ye Zhuo was a little embarrassed by Madam Cen’s praise. She touched her nose and said, “Granny Cen, falling in love is a matter between two people. Your eldest grandson is so outstanding, he must have his own opinions…”

“What opinions does he have? What opinion does he dare to have? If he dares to have any other opinion, I’ll smash his head! I’ll break his legs!”

Madam Cen wanted to strike while the iron was hot. “That’s why, Ye Zi, do you want a husband? As long as you agree to it, I’ll send him over to you later.”

Ye Zhuo was rendered speechless for a moment before replying, “… I don’t want.”

Madam Cen quickly corrected her, “Ye Zi, you’re saying the script all wrong! You should have said that you want me to send him over to you! Then, I’ll send my eldest grandson over…”

After saying that, Madam Cen continued, “It’s okay if you don’t need him now. When you need a husband, just let me know. I will send my eldest grandson over immediately!”

“Okay.” Ye Zao nodded with a smile.

“Really?” Madam Cen’s eyes lit up. Before Ye Zhuo could react, Madam Cen extended her little pinky finger to Ye Zhuo. “Ye Zi, let’s pinky swear. Whoever goes back on her word will be a puppy!”

Ye Zhuo stuck out her pinky to pinky swear with Madam Cen. Her hands were slender and fair, and her skin was as smooth as butter. It was a stark contrast to Madam Cen’s hands.

Madam Cen muttered like a little child, “Pinky swear and hang yourself, let this deal be sealed for a hundred years.”

Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “Yes, let this deal be sealed for a hundred years”

At this moment, a car stopped across the road.

It was a very low-key Maybach. It looked like the old lady’s family really had a mine!

The driver opened the car door and got out. He said respectfully, “Madam Cen.”

Madam Cen nodded and turned to look at Ye Zhuo. “Ye Zi, our driver is here to pick me up. I’ll be going back first.”

“Goodbye, Granny Cen.”

“Goodbye.”

Madam Cen sat in the back seat and spoke to the driver. “Little Wang, isn’t it hard for you to drive me in and out everyday? Are you tired?”

The driver, Little Wang, was stunned. Having been the old lady’s driver for some time now, this was the first time she had spoken to him.

“I’m not tired.”

Madam Cen continued, “Little Wang, do you think that little girl from just now is pretty?”

The driver, Little Wang, could not guess what the old lady was thinking, so he could only tell her the truth, “Yes.”

Hearing this, Madam Cen said with a proud face, “Of course! How can my granddaughter-in-law not be pretty?”

Little Wang was rendered speechless. So, it turned out the Madam Cen’s main point was just to show off in front of him that her granddaughter-in-law was very beautiful!

…

When Ye Zhuo returned home, Ye Sen had already returned and was sitting in the living room, chatting with Ye Shu.

“Zhuo Zhuo, it’s great that you’re back. Tomorrow is your aunt’s birthday. Your mother and I were just discussing about going to your aunt’s house tomorrow. You’ve been back for a long time but have yet to see your relatives. This is a good chance for you to meet them and get to know them.”

“Aunt’s house?” Ye Zhuo was stunned for a moment before she realized that Ye Shu not only had a younger brother, but she also had two older sisters and an older brother.

The ‘Aunt’ that Ye Sen was talking about was Ye Shu’s elder sister, Ye Shuang.

“Okay.” Ye Zhuo nodded and continued, “What time will we be going over tomorrow morning? I’ll sleep earlier tonight.”

Ye Zhuo had been very busy working on the OS system these few days, and she had been staying up late every single day.

“Not too early,” Ye Shu continued, “We’ll leave at nine in the morning.”

…

The next morning, Ye Zhuo woke up early. After her morning jog, she accompanied Ye Shu and Ye Sen to Ye Shuang’s house.

They took the bus and walked for more than two hours before they reached their destination.

Ye Zhuo did not expect to find that her aunt was quite well-off.

The double storey villa was extremely grand. In front of it was a large garden, and on the left side of the garden were two large fountains.

Standing in front of the luxurious villa, Ye Shu appeared a little reserved.

Ye Zhuo held Ye Shu’s arm and said, “Mom, in the future, I will buy twenty villas like this for you and uncle. One of them will be yours to live in, and nineteen of them will be rented out. I will let you sit at home as the landlord and landlady. The both of you can just collect money every day.”

“Really?” Ye Sen said excitedly.

It sounded like he was bragging, but he felt that his eldest niece would definitely be able to do it!

Ye Zhuo said, “Of course it’s true.”

Ye Shu smiled and said, “I am very happy that you are such a filial daughter.” Obviously, she did not take her daughter’s words to heart.

In the Yunjing Province, an ordinary villa would cost at least seven million yuan, and a double storey villa like this would cost at least 10 million yuan.

Not to mention 10 million yuan, even if it was 1 million yuan, their family would not be able to afford it.

Ye Sen walked up and knocked on the door.

The person who opened the door was the nanny.

When the nanny saw Ye Shu and Ye Zhuo, she did not show much respect. Instead, her eyes were filled with contempt.

‘These shameless poor relatives had come again!’

The nanny did not immediately allow them in. Instead, she turned her head and said, “Madam, we have a few visitors!”

Soon after, Ye Shuang walked out from inside. “Who’s here?”

Out of the Ye sisters, Ye Shuang was the one who had married the best. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Ye Shuang had married Lin Haifu, who was known as the ‘Miracle Doctor of the Yunjing Province’.

Lin Haifu’s medical skills were second to none in Yunjing Province. If he claimed to be the best, no one dared claim to be second best.

She and Lin Haifu had two daughters. The eldest daughter was a well-known lawyer, and the youngest daughter was currently studying at a top university.

It was not an exaggeration to say that Ye Shuang fared the best out of everyone in the Ye family. Therefore, she had always felt superior in front of Ye Shuang and Ye Sen.

Although they were siblings of the same mother, they were not from the same world!

“Big Sister,” Ye Shu greeted Ye Shuang.

Ye Shuang nodded. “It’s you guys! Come in quickly. Nanny Zhang, go get a few pairs of disposable slippers.”

After saying that, Ye Shuang seemed to have just seen Ye Zhuo and asked, “Who is this?”

Ye Shu said, “Big Sister, this is my daughter, Ye Zhuo. Zhuo Zhuo, this is your eldest aunt.”

“Nice to meet you, Eldest Aunt.” Ye Zhuo greeted politely.

Ye Shuang sized up Ye Zhuo from head to toe, and there was an imperceptible look of contempt in her eyes.

She heard rumors that this Ye Zhuo was the idiot that grew up in the Mu family and could not even recognize Chinese characters…
