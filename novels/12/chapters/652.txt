“”Sister-in-law, why are you looking for me?””

“Old Lady Lin said, “Jingshan! Didn’t we agree to take Xianxian as a disciple? Why is there a sudden change?””

“Master Yu was stunned. “When did I say that I want to take that little girl from the Feng family as a disciple? I’ve always said that I want to take your granddaughter as a disciple! Why, isn’t Zhuojiao your granddaughter?””

“Old Lady Lin choked and continued, “Jingshan, Xianxian is really a good child that is hard to come by. She is many times more outstanding than zhongruo. Why Don’t you take Xianxian as your disciple?””

“In Old Lady Lin’s opinion, wasn’t it just taking in another disciple? It was a very simple matter!”

Master Yu shook his head. “Old sister-in-law! You’re muddle-headed! That little girl from the Feng family is still lacking a little bit of fire in front of zhongruo.”

Saying that she was only lacking a little bit of fire was master Yu giving face to Old Lady Lin.

“In fact, in Master Yu’s heart, Feng Xianxian was standing in front of ye Zao and not even a shadow could be seen.”

These two people were not suitable to be compared.

“Hearing this, Old Lady Lin frowned and was very unhappy.”

“After all, Feng Xianxian was the most outstanding child in her eyes.”

But Master Yu said that Feng Xianxian was not as good as ye Zao.

Feng Xianxian was not as good as ye Zao?

This was a huge joke.

“Jingshan! Are you really not willing to take Xianxian as your disciple?”

“Master Yu continued, “It’s not that I’m not willing, it’s just that it’s not suitable. I’ve already taken Zao Zao as my disciple! And many years ago, I said that I would only take in two disciples in my life.””

“Old Lady Lin took a deep breath. “Xianxian is so outstanding. It’s your loss if you don’t take her as your disciple! Jingshan, there’s something I have to say first. Don’t think it’s unpleasant.””

“”Please speak, sister-in-law.””

“Old Lady Lin continued, “If you don’t take Xianxian as your disciple now, if you want to regret it in the future, there’s no medicine for Regret!””

Want to regret it?

No Way!

“At that time, Feng Xianxian would become the most dazzling existence.”

Old Lady Lin believed that Feng Xianxian would definitely be able to do it.

“”Don’t worry, old sister-in-law. I definitely won’t regret it.”Master Yu continued, “Old sister-in-law, although burning didn’t grow up by your side, she is still your granddaughter! Could it be that a biological granddaughter of the same lineage can’t be compared to an outsider? Aren’t you making burning’s heart turn cold by doing this?””

Not to mention ye Zao.

Even he could not stand it anymore. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Old Lady Lin’s favoritism was too exaggerated.

“”Jingshan!”Old Lady Lin looked at Master Yu, “Don’t tell me that in your heart, I am the kind of person who can’t distinguish right from wrong? Burning is my biological granddaughter. How can I not feel sorry for her? But her strength is indeed inferior to Xianxian. Don’t tell her to tell the truth?””

“Master Yu said, “Zhuozhuo knows medicine, calligraphy, and literary attainments. How is she inferior to that little lass from the Feng Family?””

“Old Lady Lin completely did not listen to these words. She continued, “Jingshan, if you really don’t wish to have Xianxian as your disciple, then forget it. I Won’t force you. I’ll return to the banquet hall first.””

“After saying this, Old Lady Lin turned around and left.”

“Just as Old Lady Lin left, master Zhou came out from inside. He looked at Master Yu with a hesitant expression.”

“Seeing him like this, master yu smiled and said, “We’ve been old friends for so many years. If you have something to say, just say it.””

Master Zhou hesitated for a moment. “It’s about the Lin family’s daughter. I also feel that you handled this matter too hastily...”

This was a major event in the literary world.

“Yet, master Yu had actually accepted a disciple so easily.”

“Furthermore, the other party was the eldest daughter of the Lin family.”

“As long as one inquired a little, one would know that the eldest daughter of the Lin family did not have a very good reputation in Beijing.”

She had never participated in any literary competition and had never won any grand prizes.

She was just an ordinary girl.

“In comparison, Feng Xianxian, who had won many prizes, was indeed more outstanding than Ye Zhuo.”

“Master Yu continued, “Come with me.””

Master Zhou followed Master Yu’s footsteps.

“After a while, the two of them arrived at the lounge. Master Yu took out the two words and handed it to Master Zhou. “Take a look at this.””

“Master Zhou took it with both hands. After opening the rice paper, he saw a set of words. He said in surprise, “Isn’t this the person you’ve been looking for?””

“When he first saw these two pieces of calligraphy, master Zhou was also shocked.”

“Even he, who was known as a calligrapher, could not write such a calligraphy.”

It could be seen that the person who wrote this calligraphy had a profound literary background!

Master Yu nodded. “Ye Zhuo is the person who wrote these two pieces of calligraphy.”

Ye Zhuo?
