“On the third day, he brought Cen Shaoqing to look for wild honey. ”

...

“Now, even ants were scared to take a detour when they saw her. ”

“”Fifth brother, I just called Grandma Cen. She said that she and Aunt Xiang haven’t had time to come yet. Why Don’t we go back first?”Everything on the island was full of food, and they were tired of eating seafood. Ye Zhuo suddenly felt a little bored. ”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing put away the newspaper. “Then let’s set off in a while! You Go Upstairs and pack your things first.”

“Ye Zao said, “Isn’t the yacht driver not here yet?” ”

“I can drive a yacht.”

“You Can Drive?”Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly.

Cen Shaoqing nodded.

“Then I’ll go pack my things first.”

Ye Zao’s things were very simple. They were packed in a short while.

The two of them went to the yacht. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Cen Shaoqing walked to the cockpit.

Ye Zao also followed curiously.

“In her previous world, the ocean was polluted, and the seawater was corrosive. The yacht was an obsolete tool. ”

“Therefore, she didn’t know how to drive a yacht. ”

“However, she did pass the driving test for a small plane. ”

“Cen Shaoqing sat in front of the driver’s seat. With one hand on the steering wheel and the other hand on the key, she skillfully started the yacht. ”

“After a short while, the yacht started to move forward slowly. ”

“It was clearly a very simple action, but it was somehow somehow somehow handsome. ”

Especially the way he held the steering wheel.

Ye Zhuo looked at it seriously.

Cen Shaoqing looked back slightly. “Do you want to Learn?”

“Can I try?”

Cen Shaoqing stood up. “Sit down. I’ll teach you.”

Ye Zhuo sat down.

“Cen Shaoqing stood behind her and leaned slightly. His slender arm came around her shoulder and landed on her hand, controlling the steering wheel. ”

The two of them were very close to each other.

Ye Zao could even feel that his breath was right beside her ear.

“Between each breath, there was each other’s breath. ”

The rhythm of their heartbeats suddenly became chaotic.

“Focus.”Cen Shaoqing controlled the steering wheel with one hand and pressed the other hand on the engine lever. “This is the engine lever. Push it down.”

Ye Zhuo used one hand to push the engine.

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “This is the speedometer. When the speedometer reaches 5,000 revolutions per hour, it can be started.” ”

“It was very easy to drive a yacht. Cen Shaoqing taught ye Zhuo hand-to-hand for about ten minutes, and Ye Zhuo learned it. ”

Sailing on the sea was more enjoyable than driving.

“Cen Shaoqing was afraid that she would make any mistakes, so he always stood by her side. ”

The seat in the cockpit was very big. Ye Zao moved closer. “Isn’t it tiring to stand? Let’s sit together.”

Cen Shaoqing leaned over and sat down.

The two of them were very quiet.

“Cen Shaoqing leaned against the back of the chair. As long as he raised his eyes slightly, he could see the slender neck of that person. Looking down, he could see the exquisite collarbone and the ups and downs of it... ”

“After a while, CEN Shaoqing felt warm and thirsty. He stood up and said, “Be steady. I’m going out to get some fresh air.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

They came to the deck.

Cen Shaoqing looked at the endless sea. He held the Buddha beads in his hands and recited the heart-cleansing mantra more than ten times before he gradually calmed down.

He had lost his composure!

He had really lost his composure just now.

“In the past thirty years, he had never lost his composure like this! ”

“Fortunately, Ye Zao was focused on driving the yacht and did not notice anything unusual. ”

“Two hours later, the yacht was successfully parked at the dock. ”

“Cen Shaoqing’s car was parked in a nearby parking lot, so he drove ye Zao back. ”

“After a while, they arrived at the Ye family’s residential area. ”

Cen Shaoqing’s gaze fell on the rearview mirror.

The rearview mirror reflected two young men and women drinking milk tea.

It’s them again?

Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly.

“After getting out of the car, ye Zao invited Cen Shaoqing to his home for a cup of tea. ”

Cen Shaoqing was just being polite.

“In fact, no matter what request ye Zhuo made, Cen Shaoqing had no resistance at all. ”

He followed ye Zhuo to the door.

Ye Zhuo rang the doorbell.

“It was Xiao Baibai who opened the door. “Welcome back, the most beautiful person in the universe, Xiao Baibai! We haven’t seen each other for so many days. Have you missed the most intelligent person in the universe, Xiao Baibai?” ”

Ye Zhuo looked at Cen Shaoqing somewhat awkwardly. “This is the robot at home.”

“Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. He looked calm on the surface, but in his heart, he felt that this robot’s tone sounded a little like ye Zhuo’s... ”

An illusion?

“Little White immediately greeted Cen Shaoqing. “Hello, Distinguished Guest. I’m the smartest little white in the universe. It’s nice to meet you.” ”

“Hello.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“After entering the house, Little White was busy pouring water for Cen Shaoqing. ”

Cen Shaoqing sat on the sofa and looked up at Ye Zhuo. “Your robot is quite smart. Is it a robot butler?”
