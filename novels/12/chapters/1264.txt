“No wonder people say that hair is a good thing, daughter is a good thing. ”

“This is not biological, in the end is not biological. ”

“No matter how much you do for her, she will not be the slightest bit grateful. ”

Take Zhou Xiang for example.

“Her mouth is better than singing, said that she treated her as her biological mother. ”

And Now?

“If Zhou Xiang really treated her as her biological mother, would she let her stay in a hotel? ”

Which daughter would say such a thing?

“Actually, Zhou Xiang was really wronged. ”

“Xie Wanqiu’s character was very strange, and she was also very strong-willed. She had to make decisions about everything. ”

“In the Zhou family, she was the only one who made decisions about the big and small matters in the Zhou family. Father Zhou could not even make decisions about the big and small things. ”

“Therefore, Xie Wanqiu and old Madam Cen did not get along. ”

Neither of them could stand the other.

“Therefore, every time she came to the capital, Xie Wanqiu would stay in a hotel. ”

“In the long run, Zhou Xiang had formed a habit. She did not expect that Xie wanqiu would change her personality this time! ”

“Zhou xiang continued, “But didn’t you always stay in a hotel when you came here before?” ”

“”That was in the past. This time, I want to stay at your house.”Xie wanqiu turned to look at Zhou Xiang and asked, “Why? You Don’t want me to stay at Your House?” ”

“”No, no, no. Why would I do that?”Zhou xiang smiled and said, “Then let’s go quickly.” ”

“Xie wanqiu followed Zhou Xiang’s footsteps and continued, “Why didn’t anyone inform me that Shaoqing was in a relationship?” ”

“Zhou Xiang felt a little troubled. “I’ve been a little busy recently, so I didn’t have the time to inform you.” ”

“Xie wanqiu put on a fake smile and said, “Then you’re really busy!” ”

“Zheng wanyin said, “Auntie, I heard that cousin’s girlfriend is very pretty. Is that true?” ”

“Yes.”Zhou Xiang nodded.

“Zheng wanyin continued, “I really want to see what my future cousin-in-law looks like!” ”

“Xie wanqiu snorted coldly. “Pretty? What’s the use of being pretty? Can she be used as money, or can she be used as food?” ”

Strength was the most important thing.

Xie wanqiu hated those who relied on their looks to get ahead the most.

“Zhou xiang hurriedly said, “Mom, actually, not only is burning beautiful, she’s also very outstanding. She and Shaoqing are evenly matched.” ”

“”Evenly matched with cousin!”Zheng wanyin said in surprise, “Then my future cousin-in-law must be very powerful, right?” ”

“Yes.”Zhou Xiang nodded.

Xie wanqiu sneered.

Evenly matched with Cen Shaoqing?

This stepdaughter of hers was probably dreaming!

“Xie wanqiu looked at Zhou Xiang. “Then tell me, what achievements has she achieved?” ”

“Zhou Xiang said, “Zhuozhuo is a very low-key good girl. I’ve told you, you and Wanyin must not tell anyone else.” ” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“”Tell me,”Xie Wanqiu said. ”

“Zhou Xiang continued, “Zhuozhuo is miracle doctor ye who cures cancer.” ”

Miracle Doctor Ye?

Cures cancer.

Did this stepdaughter of hers think that she was senile?

She really dared to say anything!

“Hearing this, Zheng wanyin exclaimed, “Aunt, that future cousin-in-law is too amazing! Curing cancer is something that benefits all mankind.” ”

“”Yes.”Zhou xiang continued, “Actually, your cousin-in-law’s achievements are far more than that. Don’t look at her age as being five or six years younger than you, but she is really outstanding. Your Cousin’s grandmother, your cousins, and I all like her very much!” ”

What did Zhou Xiang mean by this?

Was she implying that Zheng Wanyin was inferior to ye Zao?

Xie Wanqiu’s expression was very ugly.

She was five or six years younger than Zheng Wanyin.

How Old was ye Zao?

Twenty years old!

A 20-year-old little girl who could cure cancer?

Such words could only be used by an old woman like her.

Zheng Wanyin was also a simple girl. She actually believed such words.

Xie wanqiu could not be bothered to expose Zhou Xiang.

Her stepdaughter was a simple-minded person. She did not have any tricks up her sleeve. She would believe whatever others said.

“Why didn’t Ye Zhuo come with you to pick me up?”Xie wanqiu suddenly asked.

“Ye Zhuo was Cen Shaoqing’s girlfriend. If she wanted to marry into the Cen family in the future, she would have to obtain her approval. ”

“However, Ye Zhuo did not come to the airport with Zhou Xiang to pick her up. ”

“It was obvious that he did not take her, his grandmother, seriously! ”

He did not even have an elder in his eyes. He definitely could not accept such a person!

“Zhou Xiang said, “Zao did not know that you were coming.” ”

“You did not say?”Xie wanqiu asked in return.

“Yes.”Zhou Xiang nodded.

“Xie wanqiu continued, “If you did not say, didn’t she know to ask?” ”

Zhou Xiang held back a breath in her heart.

But this person was her stepmother.

“The relationship between stepdaughters and stepmothers was always rather delicate, and Xie wanqiu was already so old. If she really got into an argument with Xie wanqiu, it wouldn’t sound good if word got out. ”

“Seeing that the atmosphere wasn’t right.., ”

“zheng Wanyin smiled and helped her out. “Grandma, look at how lively it is outside! I haven’t been to Beijing for a few years, and this change isn’t just a little bit. As expected of the capital of China!” ”

“Hearing this, Xie Wanqiu turned to look out of the car window. “It has indeed changed a lot! If I had known earlier, I would have brought little six here to have some fun.” ”

Zhou Xiang gave Zheng Wanyin a grateful look.

Zheng Wanyin smiled at Zhou Xiang.

On the other side.

Ye Zhuo and old madam Cen were chatting when they suddenly heard a weak voice.

“Your uncle is awake!”Old Madam Cen said.

“Ye Zao immediately stood up from the sofa. Ye Sen, who was on the sickbed, was indeed awake. ”

“Uncle.”

“Ye Sen pressed his temples. “Zao Zao, I. . . What happened to me?” ”

“”You’re injured.”Ye Zao continued, “But you’re fine now.” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen brought over chicken soup. “Here, brother-in-law, drink some chicken soup.” ”

“Ye Sen took the bowl. “Old Mrs. Cen, I can do it myself.” ”

“”You Child, why are you being so polite with me!”Old Mrs. Cen continued, “You’ve just recovered, so you don’t have any strength at all. Let me feed you.” ”

“Ye Sen was already so old, but old Mrs. Cen still called him a ‘child’. This made him blush and feel a little embarrassed. ”

Old Mrs. Cen handed the spoon to Ye Sen’s mouth. “Open your mouth quickly!”

Ye Sen opened his mouth stiffly.

“After a bowl of chicken soup, Ye Sen had recovered a lot of his strength. ”

Old Lady Cen scooped another bowl of chicken soup for ye sen. “Drink another bowl.”

“Ye Sen said, “I can do it myself this time.” ”

Old Lady Cen could only pass the bowl to Ye Sen.

“Father Zhao had never come in from the outside. When he saw this scene, he was immediately stunned. ”

His face was filled with surprise and joy.

He was awake.

His son was finally awake!

Was this an illusion?

Father Zhao pinched himself hard.

It hurt!

It wasn’t an illusion!

It wasn’t an illusion!

His son was really fine.

Father Zhao pounced on him. “Son! You’re fine! That’s Great!”

“Ye Sen was stunned. It took him a long time to react. “Uncle Zhao, you must have mistaken me for someone else, right? I’m not your son!” ”

“”You are my son!”Father Zhao cried as he said, “Son, it’s all father’s fault for letting you down! Father didn’t take good care of the both of you and made you suffer so much! I’m sorry! Don’t worry. From now on, father will make it up to you properly!” ”

“Ye Sen raised his head to look at Ye Zao. “Zao Zao, what’s Going On?” ”

“”Son! Son!”Father Zhao continued, “Listen to what Daddy has to say to you... ... Actually, your surname is Zhao, and your name is Zhao Ziye ! Back then, your mother and I were childhood sweethearts. Later on, something happened, and we got separated ! In that era where communication equipment wasn’t developed, finding a person was like finding a needle in a haystack. Fortunately, fortunately, the heavens blessed us, allowing us to meet again Son, you actually have a sister. Your sister looks just like you ”
