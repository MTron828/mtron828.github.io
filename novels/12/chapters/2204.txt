Ye Han was immediately stunned.

“His ears turned crimson, extending all the way to the depths of his cheeks. ”

“Although he was a classmate of Shi Qingcheng and knew her personality clearly, Shi Qingcheng’s sudden words still caught him somewhat unprepared. ”

It was... quite sudden.

Ye Han even wanted to find a hole to hide in.

“”I say, you’re a man, why are you blushing?”Seeing ye Han like this, Shi Qingcheng teased with a smile, “Isn’t it just a sentence? What’s there to hesitate about!” ”

“It was fine if Shi Qingcheng did not say it, but when Shi Qingcheng said this, Ye Han’s ears turned even redder. ”

Ye Han also did not know what was going on with him.

“He was obviously not like this normally, but in front of Shi Qingcheng, it was as if he was a whole lot shorter. ”

This kind of him was very unlike him.

Shi Qingcheng just looked at Ye Han and pressed him step by step. “Say something!”

“Perhaps because she had lived in the military academy for too long, Shi Qingcheng’s personality was a little like a boy’s. ”

“In a hurry, she would not hide anything. ”

“Seeing that ye Han did not speak, Shi Qingcheng continued, “Could it be that you already have someone in your heart?” ”

“No!”Ye Han replied swiftly.

“Shi Qingcheng crossed her arms in front of her chest. “Then, can we do this thing between us or not? It’s said that women chasing men are separated by layers of gauze. Why are you like a wall?” ”

“”I, I...”Ye Han began to stutter. ”

“Shi Qingcheng said speechlessly, “Why are you still stuttering? If it’s possible, we can just be boyfriend and girlfriend. If it’s not possible, we can just be good friends!”Shi Qingcheng did not think that once this matter was exposed, they would not be able to be good friends anymore, she was a very calm person. When she liked someone, her eyes were filled with him. If she did not like him, it meant that she did not like him anymore. If she broke it off completely, even if they were to be friends again, she would not have any other thoughts. ”

“Right now, she only needed one sentence from ye Han. ”

“”You, I...”Ye Han tried his best to calm himself down. “Can you let me think about it?” ”

He did not know whether he liked Shi Qingcheng or not.

“It was just that occasionally in the dead of night, he would also spend that time in the military academy. ”

“If he were to directly reject Shi Qingcheng, he was afraid that he would regret it. ”

“However, if he were to hurriedly agree, it seemed to be too hasty. ”

“”Alright, then you should think about it carefully.”Shi Qingcheng continued, “Although I’m three years older than you, I’m beautiful and can speak well. Although I’m not as outstanding as searing, I’m not inferior to other girls either. You have to think about it carefully. If you miss this village, there won’t be this shop anymore!” ”

“Okay.”Ye Han nodded.

Shi Qingcheng turned around and left.

Ye Han stood in the same spot and watched her back.

“At this moment, Shi Qingcheng looked back slightly. “Ye Xiaohan, what are you doing?” ”

“What’s Wrong?”Ye Han asked.

“Shi Qingcheng continued, “You promised to take me around, why are you still standing there?” ”

“”Oh, I’m Coming.”Ye Han instantly reacted and jogged to catch up with Shi Qingcheng’s footsteps. ”

“Shi Qingcheng seemed to have forgotten the conversation just now. “The alliance has changed a lot over the years. By the way, where is the Central Plaza Now? Is It this way?” ”

Ye Han was stunned for a moment before he reacted. “It’s over here.”

Shi Qingcheng followed his footsteps. “I want to buy a chip. Bring me to the central plaza to take a look.”

“Okay.”

“The two of them chatted as they walked. In a short while, Ye Han had also forgotten about what had just happened. His expression and tone had become natural. However, for some reason, when he looked at Shi Qingcheng again, his heart would beat faster for a moment. ”

That feeling was like being electrocuted. It had never happened before.

...

“Man Wen successfully ascended to the presidency. Although there were many people who were not convinced, there was still a group of big shots standing behind him that he could not afford to offend. ”

“Mr. President.”The assistant walked in and said respectfully. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“What’s the matter?”Man Wen raised his head.

“The assistant continued, “Chairman Zhao is here.” ”

“Let him in.”Man Wen put down the document in his hand.

“Yes.”The assistant nodded and turned to leave.

“Soon, chairman Zhao came in. ”

“Mr. President.”

Chairman Zhao was 50 years old this year. He would retire in another 10 years. He was an old subordinate of man Jiangshan and a loyal fan of Man Xing.

“In his opinion, besides man Xing, no one else deserved to be the president. ”

“Therefore, director Zhao disliked man Wen in all kinds of ways. ”

“Even though man Wen was now the president, he still felt that man Wen was a waste. ”

Just wait.

Man Wen would be touched to the end one day.
