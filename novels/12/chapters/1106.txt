“Chapter 1107: 243: face-smacking burning online, forcefully cleaning up the family! 3”

Translator: 549690339

Zhao Xueyin’s lips curled up without a trace.

She was too flustered just now and forgot that the entire Shunxi Financial Group was now under her command.

Ye Zao wanted to show off in her territory?

Difficult!

“Wu Yong didn’t listen to Ye Zao’s orders, but she wanted to see how ye Zao would end up!”

The people on the side also looked at ye Zao curiously.

At this moment.

The sound of footsteps could be heard in the air.

It was the sound of heavy leather boots stepping on the floor.

“Everyone turned around and saw Wu Yong, who was wearing a camouflage uniform, walking over.”

“Next, Wu Yong would definitely directly ignore ye Zao.”

Zhao Xueyin looked at ye Zao without batting an eyelid. Her eyes were filled with joy.

“At this moment, Wu Yong turned slightly and saluted Zhao Xueyin.”

“Zhao Xueyin’s lips curled slightly. Just as she was about to say something, Wu Yong spoke before her, “Miss Ye, what can I do for You?””

Miss Ye?

Miss Ye! ?

“At this moment, Zhao Xueyin thought she was hearing things.”

Could it be that Wu Yong wasn’t saluting her just now?

Was he saluting ye Zao?

The others at the side were also stunned.

Didn’t Wu Yong usually only listen to Zhao Xueyin?

Why was he suddenly so respectful to ye Zao today?

“For a moment, everyone couldn’t believe their eyes.”

Ye Zao’s gaze swept past Sun Yiran. “Get him out.”

“Roger.”Wu Yong signaled to the two team members on the side.

“”How dare you!”Sun Yiran looked at ye Zao and raised her voice. “Ye Zao! If you dare to touch me, my grandfather won’t let you off...””

“Before Sun Yiran could say anything, Wu Yong covered her mouth with tape.”

“Then, Sun Yiran was dragged out of the hall by the three men.”

“Seeing Sun Yiran being dragged out, ye Zao turned to look at Zhao Xueyin, “Miss Zhao, as the interim chief of the consortium, I have three questions to ask you.””

Zhao Xueyin still couldn’t react.

She did not understand why Wu Yong would suddenly switch sides and listen to Ye Zhuo’s words.

What right did ye Zhuo have? Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Zhao Xueyin’s heart was in a mess.

She had a strange feeling.

It was as if something had changed in the unseen world.

“After a moment, Zhao Xueyin looked up at Ye Zhuo. “Ask.””

She had to calm down now.

“When the soldiers came, the generals would block. When the water came, the Earth would cover!”

She wanted to see what ye Zao could ask!

“Ye Zao was already a level higher than Zhao Xueyin. At this moment, Zhao Xueyin, who was looking down from above, looked like an elder lecturing an ignorant junior.”

“”First, how did a person like Sun Yiran, who can’t even distinguish the corporate culture, get the position of vice president? “Can I question your management ability? “Second, when the Shunxi Financial Group was in my great-grandfather’s hands, it was always ranked in the top five in the international rankings. Why did it decline in the hands of the Zhao family instead of rising? “Let alone the top five, even the top 20 in the current international rankings can’t find the name of the Shunxi Financial Group! “Third, how did the Zhao family manage the financial group all these years?””

“These three questions from ye Zao directly stunned Zhao Xueyin, causing her blood to flow backwards.”

She did not expect ye Zao to ask such a sharp question.

It hit the nail on the head.

Didn’t Ye Zao Not Know About Finance?

“The other people around were also like Zhao Xueyin, very confused.”

“Originally, everyone wanted to see ye Zao make a fool of himself.”

They did not expect that Sun Yiran and Zhao Xueyin would become the main characters in the joke.

Sun Yiran was fired by Ye Zao.

Zhao Xueyin was questioned by Ye Zao.

“In the eyes of everyone, Zhao Xueyin had always been a two-faced, two-faced existence.”

But today.

“In front of ye Zao, Zhao Xueyin had become like a noob in the workplace.”

“If one didn’t see it with their own eyes, who would believe that it was true?”

“”Why, are these three questions hard to answer?”Ye Zao continued to ask.”

Zhao Xueyin swallowed her throat.

It wasn’t difficult to answer.

It was simply impossible to answer.

“The three questions ye Zhuo asked seemed simple, but in fact, every sentence carried a trap.”

It was very obvious.

Ye Zhuo had come prepared.

This time.

She was at a disadvantage.

“There was no expression on ye Zhuo’s face. From the beginning to the end, she had an indifferent look on her face, “It’s okay if Miss Zhao can’t answer these questions now. I want to see your report before three o’clock tomorrow afternoon.””

“”Miss Ye!”The voice of the lawyer suddenly appeared in the air. “If I remember correctly, Miss Zhao’s position should be above yours, right?””

What he meant was that ye Zhuo was not qualified to let Zhao Xueyin write the report.
