“”Yuyan,”song Chenyu frowned slightly and turned to look at Cen Yuyan. ”

“What’s Wrong?”Cen Yuyan asked.

“Song Chenyu continued, “You don’t seem to have the authority to access Miss Ye’s moments.” ”

“What do you mean?”Cen Yuyan frowned.

Song Chenyu handed the phone to Cen Yuyan.

Cen Yuyan took the phone and saw the screen clearly. Her expression changed.

The phone screen actually showed that ye Zhuo’s moments were not open to her!

What did ye Zhuo mean by this?

She actually blocked her!

She was Cen Shaoqing’s fourth sister!

Did Ye Zhuo still treat her as his fourth sister?

“Cen Yuyan was furious. She held the phone and said, “I’ll go find her!” ”

Why did ye Zhuo block her? Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Song Chenyu grabbed Cen Yuyan’s wrist and said in a gentle tone, “Yuyan, you’re too impulsive!” ”

Cen Yuyan was pulled to the sofa and sat down.

“Song Chenyu continued, “If you go over to miss ye’s side just like that, what if Miss ye says that she accidentally set it up? “Furthermore, everyone has their own privacy. What if Miss Ye didn’t block you alone? “Furthermore, who is Miss Ye’s right to block? If you go over there like that, everyone will only think that you’re making trouble without reason!” ”

“Song Chenyu analyzed calmly, but there wasn’t any abnormality on his face. ”

“Zhou Xiaowan nodded. “I think what Chenyu said makes sense. Yuyan, you’d better not be too rash.” ”

“Cen Yuyan frowned. “Then what should I do?”She couldn’t ask ye Zao to block her for no reason, right? “...” ”

“Song Chenyu continued, “Just pretend that you don’t know anything. Under normal circumstances, if Miss ye treats you as family, she definitely won’t block your moments.” ”

The rest was self-evident.

“Cen Yuyan snorted coldly, “She doesn’t treat me as family? I should be the one who doesn’t treat her as family! If it wasn’t for my grandmother’s senile eyes, how could my fifth brother take a fancy to her? Does she really think that she’s some kind of heavenly fairy? Just wait and see. Sooner or later, my fifth brother will kick her out! Let’s see how she can be proud when that time comes!” ”

“In Cen Yuyan’s view, it was only a matter of time before ye Zhuo was kicked away by Cen Shaoqing! ”

A person like ye Zhuo simply did not deserve to enter the CEN family!

“”Alright, Alright. Don’t dwell on this matter.”Song Chenyu patted Cen Yuyan’s hand. “It’s just a small matter. Is it worth you being so angry about? Besides, didn’t you block Miss Ye’s circle of Friends?” ”

Cen Yuyan snorted coldly. She was extremely angry.

Even though she blocked ye Zhuo as well.

But Ye Zhuo couldn’t block her.

She blocked ye Zhuo because she didn’t want ye Zhuo to pry into her privacy.

But why did ye Zhuo block her?

What right did ye Zhuo have to block her?

“Ye Zhuo blocked her, but no! ”

“Song Chenyu continued, “Oh right, Yuyan, I’m meeting Lu Xiu tomorrow to go to the nursing home to visit the elderly. Do you want to come along?”As a public figure, song Chenyu had to do some charity activities every year. ”

She would go to the orphanage to visit the children.

She would go to the nursing home to visit the elderly.

“After that, she would find someone to take a photo and post it on the Internet. It was another trending topic. ”

Song Chenyu was very good at marketing herself. This was also the reason why she had always been the number one celebrity in the entertainment industry.

Who in the entertainment industry did not have some dirt on a female celebrity?

“However, Song Chenyu was an exception. ”

Song Chenyu was like a lotus flower that had emerged from the mud without being tainted. She was so pure that not a single stain could be seen.

“Lu Xiu knew that song Chenyu liked to do public welfare activities, so he often invited song Chenyu to the nursing home. ”

“However, Lu Xiu was of the opposite sex after all. It was different with Cen Yuyan around. ”

“When she heard the name Lu Xiu, the anger on Cen Yuyan’s face instantly disappeared without a trace. She smiled and asked, “Really?” ”

Song Chenyu nodded. “Of course it’s true! I’ve already made an appointment with him. We’ll meet at Nine o’clock Tomorrow Morning.”

“Then I’ll go to Your House at eight o’clock to look for you!”Cen Yuyan said excitedly.

“Sure.”

“”Chenyu, you’re really too good to me!”Cen Yuyan hugged song Chenyu excitedly. ”

“Song Chenyu smiled and said, “Why are you being so polite to me?” ”

“Zhou Xiaowan teased, “Yuyan, is Lu Xiu really that good? Look at you, you’ve become a flower addict!” ”

“Cen Yuyan raised her head to look at Zhou Xiaowan. Her eyes were sparkling as she said, “Lu Xiu is the most manly man I’ve ever met!” ”

“”Actually, Yuyan, there’s something that I don’t know whether to say or not,”song Chenyu said hesitantly. ”

“Cen Yuyan smiled and said, “Chenyu, who’s with whom between the two of us? Is there anything that can’t be said?” ”
