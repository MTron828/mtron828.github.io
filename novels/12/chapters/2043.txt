Dead?

What did ‘dead’mean?

‘dead’and ‘dead’meant ‘agreed’.

‘Ye Zao died! ?’?

How was this possible! !

“Hearing this, the few people at the side stood up almost at the same time. “What nonsense are you spouting! What Death? How did Miss Ye Die! Don’t you know that such words can not be casually said?” ”

“The white-bearded elder immediately said, “Calm down! Calm down! Everyone, calm down. I didn’t say this. I’m just hearsay.” ”

“”Even if it’s hearsay, you can’t say such things.”Yu Zhenfei loosened his collar, looking like he was about to fight, “Miss Ye usually treats us quite well, especially you, Bai changhu. Ask yourself, have you received any less favor from Miss Ye?” ”

“Hearing this, the others at the side all nodded, feeling that Yu Zhenfei’s words were very reasonable. ”

“Apart from life and death, there were no major matters. ” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Bai changhu should not joke about this matter!

“”Brother Yu, and everyone, listen to me. I saw that we are all not outsiders, so I spoke about this matter today.”The white-bearded elder stroked his beard, “I don’t wish for anything to happen to miss ye either, but now, such rumors are spreading. There’s no smoke without fire. I don’t have any other intentions. I’m just afraid that something has really happened to Miss Ye!” ”

“At this point, Bai changhu lowered his voice, “Miss Ye hasn’t appeared in front of all of us for several months. Now, she suddenly announced her retirement and even wants to pass on the position of female sovereign to Qiu Di. Don’t you all feel that there’s something strange about this matter? I suspect that Miss Ye has been controlled by someone!” ”

Strange.

“Of course, it was strange. ”

“After all, before ye Zao announced his retirement, there were no signs. ”

“Even when he announced the new female sovereign, she did not appear. ”

“Hearing this, Yu Zhenfei’s expression calmed down a little. ”

“Controlled?”Liu Zhengting frowned slightly. “Miss Ye is so powerful. Who can control her?”

“”It’s easy to dodge an open spear but hard to guard against an arrow in the dark,”Bai changhu said. “I’m afraid that Miss Ye has been plotted against!” ”

“Hearing this, the others looked at each other and didn’t say anything. ”

“Those who can plot against Miss ye are definitely not outsiders.”Yu Zhenfei looked outside. “There must be a traitor among the eight great clans!”

“”Brother Yu is right.”Bai changhu nodded. “Apart from the eight great clans, I see that Ye Lan and ye Han are also revealing something strange everywhere!” ”

“”These eight great clans are really something else! If it wasn’t for Miss Ye back then, the eight great clans would be what they are now!” ”

“As soon as he finished speaking, Liu Zhengting slammed the table and stood up. His face was filled with anger. ”

“Because the commotion was too loud, the surrounding people all looked over. ”

The atmosphere also became strange at this time.

“Yu Zhenfei immediately stood up and smiled at everyone. “I’m sorry, everyone. His mind is a little muddled today...” ”

Only then did Liu Zhengting realize that he had lost his composure and returned to his chair.

“Bai changhu continued, “Mr. Liu, don’t be too agitated. These are just our guesses. Miss Ye has done the eight great families a favor. I believe that they won’t easily betray Miss Ye. “Before we get the evidence, we can’t directly convict the eight great families.” ”

Yu Zhenfei nodded. “Let’s first look at the situation and the eight great clans’arguments.”

“Although the eight great clans had a high status in the Chang ‘Yue Kingdom, people like them who were loyal to ye Zhuo were not to be trifled with. ”

“Sun Bing, who had not spoken all this while, nodded. “Old Yu’s words make sense. Perhaps this is Miss Ye’s arrangement.” ”

Liu Zhengting slowly calmed down.

“As more and more people gathered, the main hall became noisy. ”

“At this moment, the noisy atmosphere suddenly quieted down. ”

Bai changhu looked outside.

“He saw that with the head chief, Shangguan Jue, as the leader, the eight heads of the eight great clans were all walking over. ”

“Bai changhu continued, “Brother Yu, you guys wait here. I’m going to take advantage of my seniority.” ”

Yu Zhenfei nodded.

Bai changhu tidied up his sleeves and went over to greet him.

“”Head chief, and the other seven clan heads. Long time no see.” ”

“The head chief, Shangguan Jue, smiled and shook hands with Bai changhu. “Old Mister Bai.” ”

“Bai changhu smiled and said, “I wonder if Miss Ye will come for today’s election?” ”

“The smile on Shangguan Jue’s face did not change. He continued, “I might have to disappoint old Mister Bai. Miss ye has already delegated full authority to our eight great clans for today’s election. She might not come.” ”

“”If Miss Ye doesn’t come, what election is this?”Bai changhu’s words were neither light nor heavy. It was as if he was questioning the head chief, but also as if he was joking. ”
