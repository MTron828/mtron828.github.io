Chapter 1310: 274: find a hole and hide in it. Ye Zao is the main assessment officer! 1

Translator: 549690339

Cen Shaoqing knows ten languages.

But Ye Zao doesn’t even know Hindi.

“If this gets out, it would be a disgrace. ”

Especially with so many people watching!

But Ye Zao sat in the wrong seat.

“Fortunately, not many people knew that ye Zao was Cen Shaoqing’s girlfriend. ”

“If others were to find out, not only would ye Zao lose face, even Cen Shaoqing would lose face as well. ”

Zheng Wanyin’s eyes flashed.

“Ye Zao was sending a message with his head lowered. He did not hear what Zheng Wanyin was saying. He looked up and asked, “What’s the matter?” ”

His voice was a little faint.

“Zheng Wanyin looked around and lowered her voice. She repeated, “Cousin-in-law, this is the position of the assessment officer.” ”

“”I know,”ye Zao’s tone was faint. ”

“If he knew, why was he sitting here? ” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Zheng Wanyin was stunned.

What was ye Zao trying to do?

“Did he really know, or was he pretending to know in order to save face? ”

“Zheng Wanyin tried her best to be tactful and said, “Cousin-in-law, the family seat and the assessment officer’s position are different. Now that the CEO is not here yet, you should hurry to the family seat! Otherwise, the CEO will get into trouble!” ”

An ordinary person actually sat in the Chief Assessment Officer’s position.

“If the CEO saw this, he would definitely scold her. ”

How could a little girl like ye Zhuo withstand this?

“Moreover, Zheng Wanyin had also heard that this chief assessment officer had a particularly big background. ”

He had his own achievements in various fields.

“Originally, he was not willing to be the chief assessment officer. ”

The CEO used a lot of effort to convince this chief assessment officer.

“However, ye Zao turned a blind eye to her words and sat in his seat without moving. ”

Yes.

She admitted that ye Zao was very beautiful. Even a man would be moved by her beauty.

Not all men liked beautiful women.

Their CEO was an exception.

The CEO was not someone who took pity on women.

“”Sister-in-law, did you hear what I Said?”Zheng wanyin continued, “Before the CEO arrives, Hurry up and follow me to the family seats.” ”

“Ye Zhuo raised his eyes slightly and his tone was a little flat. “About that, you might have misunderstood. I’m the assessment officer today.” ”

Ye Zhuo was the assessment officer?

She really dared to say that.

Why didn’t she say that she was the ABA’s CEO himself?

“Zheng wanyin continued, “Cousin-in-law, now is not the time to joke. The assessment is about to begin.” ”

Ye Zhuo turned off his phone and maintained his expression. “I’m not joking with you.”

“At this moment, Zheng Wanyin suddenly saw a figure. ”

“”Deputy Executive Officer.”When she saw who it was, Zheng Wanyin immediately stood up straight. ”

Why did the deputy executive officer come?

He must have seen ye Zao sitting in the position of the main examiner backstage and was interrogating him.

“This time, Ye Zao was finished. ”

What did this mean by ‘karma’.

This was karma.

“A second ago, Ye Zao was still bragging, saying that he was the examiner. ”

“A second later, the deputy executive officer arrived. ”

She wanted to see how ye Zao would explain himself.

Just as Zheng Wanyin was waiting to watch the joke unfold...

“The deputy executive officer walked in front of Ye Zao and said respectfully, “Miss Ye.” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly. “Speak.”

“This is the list of candidates for today’s assessment. Please take a look at it.”The Deputy Executive Officer passed a list to Ye Zao.

Ye Zao took the list and flipped through it page by page.

Zheng Wanyin stood at the side.

Her face was a little green.

What was going on?

Why was the deputy executive officer so respectful to ye Zao?

He even gave ye Zao the list of examinees.

Wasn’t this list only qualified for examinees?

Could it be...

Ye Zao was really an examinee?

How could that be possible!

Ye Zao didn’t even graduate from university.

He was still a sophomore.

No.

It was impossible.

There must be a misunderstanding.

Zheng Wanyin swallowed her throat.

“The deputy executive officer looked at Zheng Wanyin and said in a heavy tone, “Can’t you see that examiner ye has no water in his blanket? Hurry up and get examiner ye a glass of water.” ”

Zheng Wanyin was stunned.

What did the Deputy Executive Officer Call Ye Zao Just Now?

Examiner Ye?

Ye Zhuo was really an assessment officer?

Ye Zhuo?

Didn’t Ye Zhuo not graduate from university?

The ABA assessment criteria were very strict. Ordinary people could not join at all.

How did ye Zhuo become an assessment officer?

Could she have heard wrongly?

She must have heard wrongly.

Zheng Wanyin tried hard to calm herself down.

“Seeing that Zheng Wanyin did not move for a long time, the deputy executive officer continued, “Wanyin, what are you still standing there for?” ”

Zheng Wanyin was a relatively young member of the ABA.

“Therefore, the deputy executive admired her very much. ”

He felt that Zheng Wanyin was a talent that could be molded.

“However, Zheng Wanyin’s reaction today made the deputy executive somewhat disappointed. ”

“What did you say? I didn’t hear you clearly just now.”
