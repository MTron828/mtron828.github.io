An Lizi really didn’t expect Zhang Qingqing to pull such a trick.

She directly added wechat!

Just how much she wanted to marry into a rich family!

“Dog two smiled and took out his phone. “Sure, pretty girl, do you want to play chicken?” ”

“I do.”Zhang Qingqing nodded.

“Then we can team up together when you’re free.”

“When she heard that dog two had invited her to team up, Zhang Qingqing was very excited. After adding on wechat, dog two looked at an Lizi. “Cousin, what about you?” ”

An Lizi took out her phone and exchanged wechat messages with dog two.

“Zhang Qingqing looked at Lin Ze. “Handsome Lin, aren’t you going to add on wechat?” ”

Lin Ze took out his phone. “What’s Your Wechat number?”

Zhang Qingqing reported a string of numbers.

“Lin Ze continued, “I’ve added it.” ”

“At the same time, Zhang Qingqing received a friend request. ”

Lin Ze’s profile picture was of a youth wearing a black mask. He looked like an internet hacker. His wechat name was Sky City.

“After adding wechat, an Lizi stood there, feeling a little awkward. She tugged at Zhang Qingqing’s sleeve. “Let’s go back!” ” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“”Okay.”After successfully adding wechat, Zhang Qingqing was satisfied. ”

“An lizi continued, “Ah Ze, let’s go back to the table first.” ”

“Okay.”Lin Ze nodded.

“After the two of them left, dog two said, “Brother Ze, how old is your cousin older than you?” ”

“Lin Ze said, “She’s only older than me by two months.” ”

“No Wonder.”Dog two smiled.

“Li Wen, who was at the side, looked at Lin Ze with ill intentions. “Why? Do you want to be brother Ze’s cousin-in-law?” ”

“Don’t talk nonsense.”Dog two waved Li Wen’s hand away.

“”That young man is sentimental. What’s there to be embarrassed about!”Li Wen continued, “If you don’t have any feelings for your cousin, would you take the initiative to ask someone for Wechat?” ”

“Fat Tiger raised his head and said, “But didn’t dog two add Zhang Qingqing’s wechat first?” ”

“Fool! That’s because the drunkard’s intention is not in the wine!”

“Is That So?”Fat Tiger scratched his head.

“”Of course it is!”Li Wen continued, “But that Zhang Qingqing isn’t bad-looking either. Unfortunately, she’s not my type.” ”

Fat Tiger Shrugged. “She’s not my type either!”

“Dog Two looked up at Lin Ze. “Brother Ze, does your cousin have a boyfriend?” ”

Lin Ze put down his phone. “Do you really want to be my cousin’s husband?”

“”I’m just asking,”dog two said. ”

“Lin Ze said, “I don’t think so.” ”

No boyfriend...

The corners of dog two’s lips curled up.

“Li Wen cheered from the side. “Come on, dog two. As long as you get your cousin, you’ll be brother Ze’s brother-in-law!” ”

Dog Two didn’t say anything.

“After Zhang Qingqing returned to her seat, her heart was beating very fast. ”

“Although she didn’t know what Lin Ze was thinking, she was sure that buttface must be interested in her. ”

“Zhang Qingqing grabbed an Lizi’s hand. “Lizi, when you go back, you must help me ask Lin Ze if he has a girlfriend!” ”

“”Okay.”An Lizi nodded. “Qingqing, are you done eating? Let’s go after eating! There’s still a movie to watch!” ”

“Zhang Qingqing said, “Ask Lin Ze and the others if they want to go to the movie together. It’ll be more lively with more people.” ”

“”They seem to have other things to do!”An Lizi said, “Just the two of us!” ”

“How do you know that they have other things to do?”Zhang Qingqing took out her phone and sent a wechat message to dog two.

“Dog two quickly replied. Zhang Qingqing said excitedly, “Dog two has already agreed. Lizi, quickly go pay. After paying, we’ll go to the movie together!” ”

An lizi frowned slightly and turned around to pay.

“Just as she was about to pay, a good-looking hand reached out. “Use my card.” ”

“Buttface?”An Lizi looked up at Buttface.

“Buttface smiled and said, “Cousin, this meal is on me!” ”

“”No need.”An lizi continued, “Waiter, Please Use Mine!” ”

“Buttface continued, “Please come back again next time.” ”

“Alright then! Thank you!”An Lizi was a little embarrassed.

“”Of course.”Buttface said, “Brother Ze’s cousin is our cousin!” ”

“As they were talking, Lin Ze and a few others walked over. Zhang Qingqing followed behind them, wanting to talk to Lin Ze. Unfortunately, Lin Ze was a man of few words. Other than talking to fat tiger and Li Wen.., he did not respond to Zhang Qingqing at all. ”

On the other side.

C nation.

At the research base.

“Professor Cara! Professor Cara!”A staff member wearing a radiation-proof isolation suit quickly came over.

Professor Cara put down the glass tube in his hand. “What’s the matter?”

“He’s agreed! YC has agreed to sign the betting agreement!”

Professor Cara’s eyes lit up. “Are you sure?”

“In order to get YC to sign the betting agreement, Country C had held a lot of meetings with the five neighboring countries. In the end, they decided to look for people online to provoke YC. They wanted to use the method that Chinese people were best at to goad YC. They did not expect this move to be so effective, yC was too young and could not withstand the stimulation. They had agreed to it just like that! ”
