“The girl in front of him was not only young, she was also very beautiful. ”

She looked like she was at most 18 years old.

How could she be Niu Hulu YC?

“Chu Zimo gulped and reached out to shake hands with Ye Zao. “You, you are the boss’s assistant? is the boss in the back?” ”

Yes!

She was definitely the boss’s assistant.

Ye Zhuo took out his phone and logged into the technology website’s account in front of Chu Zimo. “Can you believe that I’m Niu Hulu YC Now?”

Chu Zimo was stunned.

“F * CK, F * ck! ”

Was this really the boss?

The boss himself!

Chu Zimo never dreamed that the boss would be so young!

One had to know that the youngest boss in the technology industry was only 38 years old.

When had there ever been a teenage girl?

Oh My God! VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

This was too scary!

Chu Zimo could almost imagine what kind of commotion this person would cause if he appeared at the Technology Conference!

“”Big, Big Boss, it’s really you!”Chu Zimo scratched his head. “I, I thought...” ”

Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly. “What did you think?”

He thought that the big brother was an old man in his sixties or seventies.

“”No, nothing!”Chu Zimo continued, “Big Brother, are we going to the hotel now?” ”

“Let’s go.”Ye Zao pushed the suitcase and stepped forward.

Chu Zimo pushed the wheelchair and quickly followed ye Zao’s footsteps.

Ye Zao lowered his eyes slightly. “Are you going to pick up the others?”

“No.”Chu Zimo shook his head.

“”Then this wheelchair is?”If she was not mistaken, there was a walking stick on the wheelchair. ”

“Chu Zimo could not say. This wheelchair was originally prepared for you, so he could only say, “I prepared this for my grandfather at home.” ”

“OH.”Ye Zao did not ask further.

Chu Zimo spoke while leading the way for ye Zao.

“Soon, they arrived at the underground parking lot. ”

It was a very cool Aston Martin that had been modified and equipped with very high equipment.

Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly. “This car is not bad.”

“Chu Zimo helped ye Zao Open the car door and said in surprise, “Boss, you also Know About Cars?” ”

“A little.”Ye Zao leaned into the car.

Chu Zimo put the wheelchair back into the trunk and then put ye Zao’s suitcase back in.

“Just as he sat in the driver’s seat, he received a wechat message. ”

It was from Zheng Yuanjie. [ did you get the Boss? ]

Chu Zimo turned to look at the figure in the rearview mirror and replied: [ Yes. ]

[ then I will wait for you at the hotel entrance with Dr. Warne. ]

Chu Zimo replied: [ Okay. ]

He deliberately did not tell Zheng Yuanjie that the boss was a young and beautiful girl. He wanted to give Zheng Yuanjie and Dr. Warne a surprise.

Especially Dr. Warne!

“After all, the boss had always been Dr. Warne’s Idol! ”

“If Dr. Warne saw that his idol was actually a little girl, what kind of expression would he have! ”

He would definitely be very surprised!

“After replying to Zheng Yuanjie’s wechat, Chu Zimo tilted his head and looked at Ye Zhuo. “Boss, if you get Carsick, there is a spray on the shelf on the left that specializes in treating carsickness. You can spray it and you won’t get Carsick.” ”

“The inventor of the car sickness spray was Miracle Doctor Ye, who cured cancer. ”

“Because the effect was too good and there were no side effects, it was very popular among Carsick people. ”

“”Thank you, I don’t get Carsick.”Ye Zao’s voice was shallow. ”

Chu Zimo started the engine and drove away.

...

On the other side.

Two people stood in front of a high-end five-star hotel.

“One of them was slightly younger, and the other looked to be around 50-60 years old. ”

The two of them looked at the side of the road from time to time.

They looked a little anxious.

“One of them was the famous Dr. Warne. “Little Zheng, are you sure that Little Chu has picked up senior?” ”

“Zheng Yuanjie nodded. “Yes, doctor. Don’t worry. The airport is a little far from here. They should be arriving soon.” ”

Dr. Warne was still a little worried. “Are you sure that the person they picked up is Senior?”

“”Yes, Doctor!” ”

“At this moment, an Aston Martin slowly drove over. ”

“Zheng Yuanjie’s eyes lit up. “They’re here! They’re here! Doctor, they’re here!” ”

Dr. Warne was especially excited. “Where are they?”

“Zheng Yuanjie pointed at the Aston Martin and said, “That’s Zimo’s car.” ”

“Let’s go there quickly.”

Dr. Warne couldn’t wait to meet his idol!

He had a lot of technical issues to discuss with Nehulu YC.

Zheng Yuanjie followed Dr. Warne’s footsteps.

The two of them came to the front of the car.

Chu Zimo just got out of the car.

“Where’s Big Brother?”
