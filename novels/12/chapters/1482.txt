“Chapter 1483: 315: Burning Power, the Father You can’t afford to offend! 2”

Translator: 549690339

Jin Yuyan was born a Princess of Korea and had seen all kinds of people.

But this was the first time she had seen someone like ye Zhuo.

“Did you show her my seal?”Jin Yuyan asked.

“Yes.”The assistant nodded.

“Yes?”Jin Yuyan narrowed her eyes. “How did she react when she saw the seal?”

“The assistant thought back to the scene just now and said, “She didn’t have much of a reaction. Let me pass that sentence on to you.” ”

How could this be?

Jin Yuyan had thought that ye Zhuo had rejected them because he thought they were swindlers.

“But now, it seemed that things were not like that. ”

“Jin Yuyan looked at the assistant and continued, “What kind of person do you think Miss Ye Is?” ”

“The assistant thought seriously for a moment before continuing, “I think she’s very special. She’s different from all the other girls.” ”

Jin Yuyan nodded. “She is quite different.” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“The strong all had a desire to conquer, and Jin Yuyan, the eldest princess, was no exception. ”

“It was not easy for a talent like ye Zhuo, and she really did not want to give up just like that. ”

“Turning ye Zhuo into a citizen of Korea would not only allow Korea to win this competition, but it would also consolidate her position in Korea, allowing her to inherit the throne more smoothly! ”

“Although Jin Yuyan was the eldest princess and was the most qualified person to inherit the throne, the Royal Palace of Korea had been constantly fighting in recent years, and there were many people who showed up. ”

“If she didn’t do something, she might be suppressed by others. ”

Jin Yuyan narrowed her eyes. It seemed that she had to do it herself.

...

“After training, Bai Xiaosu took ye Zao to a restaurant on the island to eat. ”

“Because of the recent competition on the island, the people who came to the restaurant for a meal were all people from different countries. Their skin color, clothes, and language were all varied. ”

“”There’s another seat over there. Miss Ye, let’s sit over there.”Bai Xiaosu found that there was an empty seat in the middle of the hall. ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly and walked over.

“After sitting at the table, Bai Xiaosu took the tablet and ordered the dishes. ”

“She had eaten with ye Zao a few times and knew ye Zao’s taste. In the end, she even specially ordered a few desserts before the meal. ”

The desserts were served very quickly.

“When ye Zao saw the desserts, his beautiful eyes lit up. He immediately picked up one and tasted it. ”

“The eating habits of the C nation people were very different from the Chinese people, but the desserts were very delicious. ”

Sweet but not greasy.

“Bai Xiaosu was a person who didn’t like desserts very much. She picked up the cup and drank a mouthful of lemonade. At this moment, she suddenly felt that the restaurant seemed to have quieted down. She looked around and realized that.., the restaurant that was filled with people just a moment ago was now only left with a table of guests! ”

“”You’re really in a hurry to come and go,”Bai Xiaosu teased. ”

Deng Deng Deng Deng —

“At this moment, the sound of footsteps suddenly came from the quiet air. ”

It was the sound of exclusive high heels.

Bai Xiaosu put down his glass and turned to look in the direction of the sound. He saw a middle-aged woman wearing a champagne-colored limited-edition luxury brand dress walking over.

Bai Xiaosu knew this luxury brand.

It was ZY.

It was a product from China and also the most high-tech clothing in China. It was called an air-conditioner by the outside world.

Wearing them was like walking on air-conditioning.

It was warm in the winter and cool in the summer.

The dress the middle-aged woman was wearing cost seven figures.

She dared to wear a house. She must be rich.

Bai Xiaosu narrowed his eyes.

“”Miss Ye.”Just as Bai Xiaosu was lamenting, the middle-aged woman stopped in front of their table. ”

“To be more precise, she stopped in front of Ye Zhuo. ”

“Bai Xiaosu was stunned and looked up at Ye Zao. “Miss Ye, do you know each other?” ”

Ye Zao put down his silver fork and shook his head slightly. “I don’t.”

Could she be ye Zao’s Fan?

Bai Xiaosu took another sip of lemonade.

“After all, Ye Zao had appeared on variety shows in China and had even been on Weibo’s trending searches previously. ”

“The middle-aged woman just stood there and continued, “Miss Ye, I’m Jin Yuyan from Korea. I’m very happy to meet you here today.” ”

Jin Yuyan!

Jin Yuyan from Korea.

Bai Xiaosu’s eyes widened when he heard this.

“If she remembered correctly, the royal family of Korea was surnamed Jin, and their royal eldest princess was called Jin Yuyan. ”

“She usually saw the eldest princess on TV, but she didn’t expect to finally see her in person. ”

No wonder she felt that Jin Yuyan was familiar when she first saw her.

“”Hello.”Ye Zhuo stood up and shook hands with Jin Yuyan. “If the eldest princess is still here because of that incident, I will still say the same thing. I will never betray my country.” ”
