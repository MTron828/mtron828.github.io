Translator: 549690339

“Zhao Xueyin pinched her fingers and raised her head to look at Father Zhao, “The onlooker sees clearly, but the person in the middle is confused. If you were me, what you did might not be as good as mine!” ”

“What did you say?”Father Zhao was so angry that his face was red.

Zhao Xueyin repeated what she had just said.

“”Vile daughter!”Father Zhao clutched his chest and coughed heavily twice, “Would I be inferior to a little girl like you? If you were my son today, I would simply beat you to death! Just treat it as if I have never raised such a useless thing like you!” ”

“Although Father Zhao had no taste, he was determined not to lay a hand on a woman. ”

“Although he was very strict with Zhao Xueyin, he had never laid a hand on her. ”

“When she was young, at most, he would hire a family teacher to discipline her. ”

Son.

It was a son again.

“Zhao Xueyin’s eyes flashed with a strong sense of unwillingness, and the anger in her heart was ignited in an instant. ”

She felt that her life was a joke.

Her mother was gone when she was born.

“Then, she was rejected by her biological father as not a son. ”

“If her mother was still around, her life would definitely not have become like this. ”

“”Son! You only know about sons! Have you ever had a daughter like me in your eyes? You like your son so much, what else do you want me to do? If you have the ability, go and give birth to a son!”She did not know how to give birth, yet she still blamed her! ”

How could she have such a father!

Father Zhao did not expect Zhao Xueyin to say such a thing.

People with physical defects abhorred such words the most.

“As the saying goes, one should not expose one’s shortcomings when scolding others. ”

It was fine if others said so.

But Zhao Xueyin was her biological daughter!

“He was still holding the power of the consortium, yet Zhao Xueyin dared to treat him like this. ”

“When he was old and could not move, wouldn’t Zhao Xueyin be even more outrageous? ”

“Father Zhao looked at Zhao Xueyin in disbelief. “What, what did you say?” ”

“Zhao Xueyin also realized that these words might be a little harsh. “Dad, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to...” ”

“Father Zhao didn’t speak for a long time, his eyes filled with disappointment. ”

“Seeing Father Zhao like this, Zhao Xueyin panicked and directly cried out,”... I just miss my mom too much. I really didn’t mean to. Dad, don’t be angry...” ”

“Hearing these words, Father Zhao’s heart softened a little. ”

That’s right.

This child didn’t have a mother.

It was the child’s fault for not teaching her father.

“Now that Zhao Xueyin had become like this, he was also responsible. Father Zhao waved his hand. “You’re tired too. Go upstairs and rest first.” ”

“Dad...”

Father Zhao ignored Zhao Xueyin and walked towards the study.

Zhao Xueyin sighed and also walked upstairs.

“By the time the lawyer found out about this, it was already afternoon. ”

“The lawyer came to the Zhao family and saw Zhao Xueyin whose eyes were as swollen as walnuts. His heart ached. “Xueyin, what exactly is going on?” ”

The lawyer really couldn’t figure out why Zhao Xueyin had entered the detention center all of a sudden.

“It was ye Zao who framed me!”

“”Ye Zao?”The lawyer continued, “Is this related to ye Zao?” ”

“”Yes.”Zhao Xueyin nodded, “From the beginning to the end, it was ye Zao who set me up! She clearly knew that Grandma Zhou would not use the prescription she gave her, but she still gave the prescription to Grandma Zhou! Then, she bribed Grandma Zhou to get the prescription, and finally used Auntie Wang to set me up! This was actually not her fault! If you want to blame someone, blame me for being too gullible! Foolishly deceived by her!” ”

“From Zhao Xueyin’s point of view, ye Zao had done it on purpose. ”

“If ye Zao had not done it on purpose, could she have been tricked so miserably? ”

Sister-in-law Wang was in cahoots with ye Zao!

The people in the entertainment industry were indeed different!

They were too good at acting!

Zhao Xueyin had never been tricked so miserably by anyone before.

Ye Zao was the first.

“Zhao Xueyin continued, “Ever since ye Zao came to the consortium, you’ve changed, and so has Xiao Yu! Anyway, all of you will leave me in the end, so it’s better for you to leave me now!” ” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The lawyer frowned.

He did not expect things to be so complicated.

He did not expect ye Zao to be the mastermind of this matter.

He had misjudged ye Zao!

“The lawyer hugged Zhao Xueyin tightly. “Xueyin, don’t worry, I will never leave you.” ”

Zhao Xueyin could not care about anything else. She hugged the lawyer and cried loudly.

Heartbreaking.

The lawyer was in unbearable pain.

He hated himself for not protecting Zhao Xueyin well.

“After comforting Zhao Xueyin, Si lui went downstairs quietly. ”

“Ah Lui is here.”Father Zhao’s voice suddenly appeared in the living room.

Si lui turned around. “Uncle.”

“Sit down.”Father Zhao’s voice sounded a little tired.

Si lui sat down on the sofa.

“Father Zhao continued, “Ah Lui, you and Xueyin have underestimated ye Zhuo from the start.” ”
