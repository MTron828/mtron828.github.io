“When he saw these hands, the man’s expression changed slightly. ”

“What’s Wrong?”Liang Ying looked up at him.

“The man continued, “What’s the name of this streamer?” ”

“”Sitara YC’s Ye,”Liang Ying replied. ”

Ye?

Also surnamed Ye?

Was it a coincidence?

“The man sat up straight and continued, “Do you have the full face of this streamer?” ”

“Liang Ying said, “Yezi had attended Miao Yin’s annual gala before, but that was two years ago. Her old fans had seen her before. It was said that she was very beautiful in person, but now her picture can no longer be found on the Internet.” ”

Liang Ying had only become a fan of ye Zao this year. She felt especially regretful that she could not see ye Zao’s face.

“Hearing this, the man frowned. ”

“Why are you suddenly so curious about Yezi?”Liang Ying continued to ask.

“It’s nothing. I’m just asking.”

“OH.”

“The man asked again, “By the way, how old is this streamer this year?” ”

“Eighteen?”Liang Ying was not too sure either.

Eighteen?

“If it was eighteen, their ages did not match. ”

Could it be...

That he was thinking too much?

The man lifted the blanket and got off the bed.

“Liang Ying asked curiously, “Brother Wei, where are you going?” ” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“I’m going out to make a call.”

“OH.”

“Cao Wei went to the balcony and lit a cigarette before making a call. “Hello, help me look up an anchor.” ”

“It was unknown what was said there, but Cao Wei continued, “Yes.” ”

“”Alright, I’ll send you a wechat message.” ”

“After hanging up, Cao Wei opened wechat. ”

He returned to his room ten minutes later.

“You went out for so long. What did you do?”Liang Ying was a little displeased.

Cao Wei’s expression was indifferent. “I made a call.”

“Liang Ying glanced at him. She knew that Cao Wei did not like blabbering women, so she did not ask further. ”

On the other side.

“After ye Zhuo ended the broadcast, he still donated all of today’s earnings to the charity organization anonymously. ”

Song Chenyu had been very busy recently.

“He was busy filming a television series, rushing to catch up on his work, and also busy dealing with Cen Yuyan. ”

“After filming a segment, Cen Yuyan walked over and said with a sullen face, “Chenyu, I invited Lu Xiu to watch a movie yesterday, but Lu Xiu rejected me.” ”

Cen Yuyan really liked Lu Xiu very much.

“Even though Lu Xiu’s family background was inferior to the CEN family, even if Lu Xiu didn’t like her at all, she still liked Lu Xiu. ”

“Song Chenyu patted Cen Yuyan’s hand, then, she said, “Yuyan, why don’t you forget it? Lu Xiu has grown up with me since young, and I know him very well. If he has someone in his heart, no matter how hard you try, he won’t be moved.” ”

“As she said this, song Chenyu paused. “Yuyan, you’re my best friend. I don’t want you to walk down a path of no return.” ”

Lu Xiu already had someone in his heart.

Who else could he have in his heart?

“Of course, it was ye Zhuo! ”

“When she thought about how Lu Xiu actually liked ye Zhuo, Cen Yuyan felt even more indignant. ”

What right did ye Zhuo have?

“He already had Cen Shaoqing, yet he still dared to seduce Lu Xiu. ”

He was simply Shameless!

Cen Yuyan bit her lip. “But I’m indignant!”

“”Forget it.”Song Chenyu looked at Cen Yuyan. “Miss Ye is indeed very outstanding. Otherwise, fifth master wouldn’t have liked her. It’s normal for Lu Xiu to like Miss Ye.” ”

The subtext of this sentence was that Cen Yuyan couldn’t compare to ye Zao.

Ye Zao was someone who could even subdue Cen Shaoqing.

“Cen Yuyan snorted coldly. “I really don’t know what kind of Charm Ye Zao has! It’s one thing for him to bewitch my grandmother and Shaoqing, but now even Lu Xiu has been deceived by her! She’s fickle and fickle. She’s simply Shameless!” ”

“”Don’t talk about miss ye like that.”Song Chenyu had a kind and understanding look on his face, “Liking someone comes from the heart, and there’s no way to control it. Lu Xiu likes miss ye because he’s attracted to her personality. I’ve known Lu Xiu for so long, but I’ve never seen Lu Xiu like someone so seriously.” ”

“When she said the last sentence, a look of envy appeared in song Chenyu’s eyes. ”

Personality?

What kind of personality could ye Zhuo have?

“Actually, it was not seduction! ”

“Cen Yuyan thought that she was a person with a good personality and was easy to get along with, but she did not have the slightest good impression of ye Zao. ”

She even felt uncomfortable when she saw ye Zao.

Not to mention seeing him.

Cen Yuyan could not even bear to hear ye Zao’s name.

“”Chenyu, why do you always speak up for ye Zao!” ”

Song Chenyu smiled. “I’m not speaking up for anyone. I’m speaking from the facts.”

“Cen Yuyan frowned. “Ye Zhuo doesn’t even want to add you on wechat. He’s looking down on you, yet you’re still speaking up for her! Chenyu, I think you’re an idiot!” ”
