“Chapter 959: 219: Cen Yuyan finally came to her senses. Dog Bites Dog, a mouthful of fur! 2”

Translator: 549690339

“Song Chenyu poured herself a glass of water and moistened her throat. “If it wasn’t for that trick, do you think she would have believed me? In short, you have to be more careful. Acting out a trick requires brains!” ”

Hearing these words.

“Cen Yuyan, who was hiding in the closet, was trembling all over. ”

It was a ploy to make her suffer.

So those were all ploys to make her suffer.

“Looking back on her actions these past few days, Cen Yuyan felt that she was the dumbest fool in the world. ”

The true lovers and true sisters that she thought were all fake in the end.

They were just acting with her.

“Cen Yuyan now really missed old Madam Cen, Zhou Xiang, and her three older sisters. ”

She regretted not listening to the words of her family.

“Other than regret, the only thing left was guilt. ”

She felt extremely guilty!

It was her fault.

It was all her fault.

She had let down those who truly loved her.

“”Got it.”Zhou Rui stood up and continued, “When will your two million be transferred over?” ”

“I’ve already asked my assistant to arrange it.”

“Then I’ll be leaving first.”Zhou Rui turned around and walked out.

“Song Chenyu stood up to send him off and reminded him, “Remember what I said. No matter what you do outside, remember to keep your hands and feet clean. Don’t do something that will bring you nothing.” ”

“”I got it, I got it! Aren’t you annoying? !” ”

“Looking at Zhou Rui’s back, the corners of Song Chenyu’s mouth curled up as she spat out two words, “Idiot!” ”

“In her eyes, Zhou Rui and Cen Yuyan were both idiots among idiots! ”

“If Zhou Rui did not have something to hold over him, she would not even look at Zhou Rui! ”

“After Zhou Rui left, song Chenyu turned around and returned to his room. ”

“Then, he entered the bathroom to wash up. ”

“During this period of time, Cen Yuyan had been sitting in the cabinet. Her face was deathly pale, and her entire person was like dead wood and ashes. There was not a single bit of luster on her body. ”

“After a long while, Cen Yuyan finally reacted. She stumbled out of the cabinet with tears on her face. ”

Cen Yuyan also didn’t know how she left this place.

“Standing on the busy street, Cen Yuyan’s face was at a loss. ”

She didn’t know where the future was.

She also didn’t know where she should go next. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

She was like a homeless vagrant.

What was the point of living?

How about...

She died.

“For a person like her, there was no point in living in the world. ”

She might as well die.

“Now, death was a relief for CEN Yuyan. ”

Cen Yuyan stuck out her stomach and walked to the middle of the road in a daze.

“Seeing a taxi quickly rushing over, Cen Yuyan closed her eyes. ”

“At this moment, countless images flashed before Cen Yuyan’s eyes. ”

There was old Madam Cen.

Zhou Xiang.

“There were three older sisters, Cen Shaoqing and Ye Zao. ”

“When she thought about it, the people she had let down the most were old madam Cen and ye Zao. ”

It was because of Song Chenyu.

She had imagined ye Zao as a scheming woman...

And Zhou Xiang and the three older sisters at home...

She had let them down.

A crystal-clear tear flowed from the corner of Cen Yuyan’s eyes.

PFFT!

“At this moment, an ear-piercing screech of brakes sounded in the air. ”

The front of the car was only 0.01 millimeters away from Cen Yuyan’s body.

Just a little bit.

Just a little bit more and the car would have hit Cen Yuyan.

“The driver cursed as he got out of the car. “What are you doing? If you don’t want to live, jump into the river! Who are you trying to harm by standing here?” ”

“Cen Yuyan opened her eyes and immediately bent down to apologize to the driver. “I, I’m Sorry!” ”

“The driver was furious. He was already tired after working for a whole day, and now he almost killed someone. If it were anyone else, they would not be too happy. ”

“”What’s the use of being sorry? Do you know that you almost killed me just now? If you want to die, then go die. What’s the point of implicating others here? Do you know that I have a Family?” ”

“Speaking up to this point, the driver looked at Cen Yuyan, then, he said, “You were deceived by a man? So you couldn’t take it lying down and sought death? I say, you’re quite interesting. You’re not even afraid of death, so why are you still afraid of living? If I Were you, I definitely wouldn’t die! I’ll pull myself together and personally watch that scumbag get his retribution!” ”

“Hearing this, Cen Yuyan seemed to have caught onto something as a light flashed in her eyes. ”

Yes.

She couldn’t die.

She hadn’t seen song Chenyu and Zhou Rui get their comeuppance yet!

“Thank you.”Cen Yuyan bowed deeply.

The driver waved his hand and turned to walk into the car.

“After sitting in the driver’s seat, the driver turned to look at the co-driver and said gratefully, “Young Lady, thank you! If it wasn’t for you, I would have gotten into trouble just now! Thank you!” ”
