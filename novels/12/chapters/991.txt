“Chapter 992: 224: a slap in the face. Big Brother Ye is still you, Big Brother Ye! 4”

He was still in university when he was 20 years old.

Ye Zhuo was able to take charge of the laboratory when he was 20 years old.

It was really infuriating to compare people!

“Cen Hu gulped, not knowing what to say. ”

“After Cen Shaoqing arrived, director Zhao and professor Yue immediately came over to welcome him. “Master five, I called you over this time because I have something to discuss with you.” ”

“”Elder Zhao, please speak.” ”

“Director Zhao continued, “It’s about the international science and Technology Exhibition. The Science and Technology exhibition will be held in a few days. The International Department is already urging the list of names. We haven’t arranged for a suitable person to go over yet.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips parted slightly. “I’ll go over to the international exhibition this time, and then professor Yue and Professor Wang will go over as well. I’ll have to trouble you with the base.” ”

“Director Zhao nodded and continued, “Then there’s still one more person left.” ”

“Tang Xue narrowed her eyes. “Why don’t we ask Miss Ye to go too? It just so happens that the international exhibition is in time for the winter vacation. Miss Ye’s talent is outstanding, so she’ll definitely be able to help!” ”

Professor Yue frowned slightly.

She had always felt that Tang Xue was a person who knew her limits.

Why would she say such inconsiderate words today?

Send Ye Zao over?

That was an international exhibition.

Perhaps even Dr. YC would appear.

What was ye Zao going over?

Was he embarrassing himself?

“Although ye Zao had dazzled everyone at the base last time,. ”

Professor Yue still felt that it was strange.

How Old was ye Zao?

She hadn’t even graduated from university. was her ability really that terrifying?

Perhaps this was just a self-directed play by Cen Shaoqing to get them to accept ye Zao.

Tang Xue and professor Yue had the same thoughts.

It was precisely because she doubted ye Zao that she suggested that Ye Zao go together!

“If ye Zao lost face at the Science and Technology Exhibition, then it would be interesting. ”

Tang Xue’s lips curled up without a trace.

Cen Shaoqing turned to look at ye Zao. “Do you want to Go Together?”

Ye Zao Thought for a moment. “What’s the exact date?”

“”The afternoon of the day after tomorrow,”director Zhao replied. ”

Ye Zao nodded. “Sure.”It just so happened that she had nothing to do during that period of time.

“Upon hearing this, professor Yue’s expression turned ugly. ”

Ye Zao was overestimating himself.

Did she know what the science and Technology exhibition meant?

She was probably going to embarrass Cen Shaoqing!

“Professor Yue smiled and said, “Master Five, can you ask Xiaoxue to go with me?” ”

He asked Tang Xue to go with him because he wanted to substitute ye Zao.

“If ye Zao caused any trouble at the science and Technology Exhibition, he could ask Tang Xue to make up for it immediately. ”

“Hearing this, Tang Xue was delighted. ”

She knew that Professor Yue would not let her down.

“After saying this, professor Yue added, “I’m not feeling well at the moment. If I let Xiaoxue go, she can take care of me at the same time.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing nodded. “Then, let Tang Xue go too.” ”

“”Thank you, Fifth Master.” ”

...

On the other side.

At the Xi family home.

“After getting along with Aunt Lang for a while, little half moon still resisted. She didn’t even let Aunt Lang take a hit. ”

“Aunt Lang was very uncomfortable. She stood up and said, “I’m going out for a walk.” ”

“Yang Jiao said, “Sister, don’t worry. It’s not that Little Half Moon doesn’t like you, she just doesn’t understand you yet.” ”

“MMM.”Aunt Lang nodded.

“It was dark outside, and a cool breeze blew in, clearing up Aunt Lang’s mind. ”

Inside the house.

“Yang Jiao was lecturing Little Half Moon. “Little Half Moon, that person just now is your mother. Don’t be afraid of her. She’ll be heartbroken if you do this.” ”

“Xi Weiyue smiled. “Mother, Sister Half Moon just came back, don’t force her.” ”

“Xi Weiyue reached out to Little Half Moon. “Sister Half Moon, let me take you to rest, okay?” ”

Little Half Moon gulped and reached out to take Xi Weiyue’s hand.

Xi Weiyue took little half moon upstairs to rest.

Yang Jiao and Xi Weiyue looked at each other and saw the scheming look in each other’s eyes.

“After a while, Aunt Lang came in. “Where’s Little Half Moon?” ”

Yang Jiao smiled. “She went upstairs to rest with Weiyue.”

Aunt Lang nodded and went upstairs.

The door to the room was closed.

“Aunt Lang knocked on the door. “It’s aunt, right? The door isn’t locked. Just come in.” ”

Aunt Lang pushed the door open and went in.

Xi Weiyue and Little Half Moon sat on the bed. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“When they saw Aunt Lang come in.., xI weiyue smiled and said, “Maybe it has something to do with her past experience. These days, Sister Half Moon has been letting people accompany her to sleep. Since you’re here, since you’re here, then it’s your turn to accompany Sister Half Moon.” ”

“”No, no, no, don’t let her go.”Little Banyue gripped XI Weiyue’s clothes tightly. ”
