Chapter 1263: 263: this is simply a fantasy. Ye Sen woke up 3

Translator: 549690339

Ye Zao was Miracle Doctor Ye.

He was the first person to cure cancer.

He was just a small doctor. It was normal for ye Zao not to believe him.

It was fine if ye Zao did not believe him now.

Facts speak louder than words!

“Six hours later, if ye Sen did not wake up, Ye Zao would believe him! ”

“At that time, ye Zao would know that what he said was right. ”

“It can’t be called a miracle.”Ye Zao’s voice was shallow.

“Doctor Li smiled and said, “Miracle Doctor Ye, you’re too modest.” ”

“Ye Zao continued, “Doctor Li, do you have anything else?” ”

“”No,”doctor Liu continued, “Miracle Doctor Ye, then I won’t bother you anymore! I’ll return to the department first.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly and turned around to return to the ward.

“As soon as he returned to the ward, ye Shu said, “Zhuo Zhuo, can your uncle eat when he wakes up?” ”

“”Yes.”Ye Zhuo continued, “But he can only eat a little liquid food.” ”

“When doctor Li, who had not gone far, heard this, a helpless look flashed across his eyes. ”

Eat?

“For the current ye Sen, eating might only happen in his next life! ”

Doctor Li shook his head.

“Okay.”Ye Shu took out her phone. “Then I’ll call your father and Ah Ze to make some chicken soup and bring it over.”

“”No need to call, no need to call. I brought chicken soup over.” ”

The voice came before the person arrived.

Ye Zhuo turned around and saw Zhou Xiang and old Mrs. Cen walking in from outside.

“”Grandma Cen, Auntie.”Ye Zao immediately went out to greet them. ”

Ye Shu also went out to greet them.

“Zao Zao.”Old Mrs. Cen held ye Zao’s hand. “How is Your Uncle Now?”

“The surgery went very smoothly. He will wake up around six or seven o’clock in the afternoon.”

“”That’s good.”Old Mrs. Cen nodded. “When I found out about this, I was shocked! By the way, have you caught the murderer?” ”

“Not yet.”Ye Zhuo shook his head.

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “This method is obviously malicious revenge. Did your uncle offend anyone?” ”

Malicious revenge.

Father Zhao’s eyebrows jumped when he heard this.

Did they really find out about him?

Father Zhao was anxious and worried at the same time.

Ye Sen really couldn’t wake up from his anxiety.

He was worried that he would be discovered.

This feeling was very bad.

“Ye Zhuo continued, “According to my uncle’s character, he shouldn’t have offended anyone.” ”

“Then could it be a competition among peers?”Old Mrs. Cen continued to ask.

Ye Zhuo’s expression remained the same. “I can’t rule out this possibility.”

“Ye Shu poured water into a cup. “Old Lady, what would you like to drink? Green tea or orange juice?” ”

“”I’ll just drink boiled water,”Madam Cen answered. ”

“”Xiang Xiang, what about you?”Ye Shu turned to look at Zhou Xiang. ”

“Zhou Xiang said, “I’ll drink green tea.” ” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Okay.”Ye Shu nodded and began to pour water.

“Soon, ye Shu arrived with boiled water and green tea. ”

“Madam Cen picked up the cup and took a sip of tea. She moved closer to ye Zao’s ear and whispered, “Zao Zao, who is that Bald Man?” ”

Bald Qiang?

There was a Bald Qiang in this room?

“Ye Zao was stunned for a moment before he asked, “Which Bald Qiang?” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “It’s that Bald Qiang who is a little bald and wears a blue shirt.” ”

Only then did ye Zao React. The ‘Bald Qiang’that old Mrs. Cen mentioned should be referring to Father Zhao.

He had to admit that old Mrs. Cen’s comparison was quite vivid.

“Looking at it this way, Father Zhao did indeed look like a Bald Qiang. ”

“Ye Zao continued, “That Bald Qiang claimed to be my uncle’s biological father.” ”

“Biological father?”Old Mrs. Cen widened her eyes. “Really? That Bald Qiang doesn’t look like a good person!”

Ye Sen was a good person without any good intentions. Old Mrs. Cen was worried that he would be deceived by the Bald Qiang.

“You have a good eye!”Ye Zao said.

“”Of course.”Old Mrs. Cen stuck out her chest proudly. “If I didn’t have a good eye, how could I choose such an excellent granddaughter-in-law like you?” ”

Even a narcissistic person like ye Zao was embarrassed by the praise.

“After saying that, old Mrs. Cen asked curiously, “Why do I see the Bald man looking so familiar? What’s his name?” ”

“”Zhao Zhenfei,”ye Zao answered. ”

“”So it’s him!”Old Mrs. Cen said, “I was wondering!” ”

“You know him too?”Ye Zao asked curiously.

“Old Mrs. Cen lowered her voice and said, “To tell you the truth, the good brother of the Bald Man once chased me!” ”

“Really?”The gossipy factor in ye Zao’s body was immediately triggered.

“”Of course it’s true.”Old Mrs. Cen patted her chest, “Your grandmother, I was one of the top beauties who chased after me back then. I could line up from the south of the city to the north of the city! In the end, I was blind and was deceived by the fifth girl’s grandfather! That old man was very bad. Shaoqing’s character was just like his grandfather’s. Don’t look at him as a prim and proper person. In today’s words, he was just sultry... “...”. “...” ”
