This kind of person just couldn’t bear to see others better than her!

“According to Zhang Qingqing’s knowledge, Lin Ze’s family background was much better than the Anlizi family’s. ”

“Lin Ze’s father owned all the shares of the Lin Group, and his mother, Ye Shu, was the founder of the ye group’s private dishes! ”

“His younger sister, Ye Zhuo, was the successor of the Shunxi Financial Group. ”

“Ye Zhuo was just a girl. As the saying goes, once ye Zhuo married out, the management rights of the Shunxi Financial Group would definitely be handed over to her, the eldest daughter-in-law. ”

“At that time, she will be the young mistress of the Lin Family! ”

Being the young mistress of the Lin family is much more glorious than being the eldest daughter of the Lin family.

“In front of her, an Lizi could not even be considered a pinky finger. ”

“Fat tiger continued, “I have an appointment with a friend over there. I’ll go over first.” ”

“En.”Zhang Qingqing nodded. “I should go back too.”

“Walking out of the game city, Zhang Qingqing called an Lizi and asked her to meet at a cafe. ”

An Lizi agreed.

“By the time Zhang Qingqing arrived, an Lizi had already sat in her seat and waited for a long time. ”

“”Qingqing, why did you call me out in such a hurry?”An Lizi asked. ”

Zhang Qingqing looked at an Lizi with eyes full of regret. “Lizi! I never thought that you were such a person! I treated you so well and treated you as my only good friend. Is this how you treat me?”

“What’s wrong with me?”An Lizi was confused.

“”What’s wrong with you? You still have the nerve to say what’s wrong!”Zhang Qingqing questioned angrily, “Let me ask you, why did you lie to me! ?”! Lin Ze clearly doesn’t have a girlfriend, and I trusted you so much, yet you lied to me! In your eyes, I’m just a gold digger, right? You must think that I’m very funny, right? Yes! You’re a rich young lady now, and I’m just an ordinary person. If you don’t like me, just say it. Why use such a thing to disgust people!” ”

Zhang Qingqing said a lot in one breath. She was not afraid of offending an Lizi. This matter was originally an Lizi’s fault!

“An Lizi did not expect Zhang Qingqing to find out so quickly, “Qingqing, let me explain. Things are not what you think! I have never looked down on you. We were good friends before we learned how to walk. In My Heart, you have always been my good friend. This matter is indeed my fault. I apologize to you! I’m Sorry!” ”

A mistake was a mistake. An Lizi did not want to explain too much.

“Zhang Qingqing was an Lizi’s childhood friend, and it was also a memory of her childhood. She didn’t want to break up with Zhang Qingqing. ”

Zhang Qingqing snorted coldly. “Who knows if you’re sincerely apologizing!”

“”It’s true, Qingqing. I really didn’t mean anything by it. I just thought that you and my cousin weren’t too suitable.” ” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Lin Ze’s personality was eccentric, and he didn’t talk much. He was suitable for understanding people. Girls who could enter his heart and speak the same language as him. ”

Zhang Qingqing only wanted to marry into a rich family. It wasn’t good to approach Lin Ze with a purpose.

“”Not suitable?”Zhang Qingqing’s eyes were full of self-mockery, “You look down on me, right? That’s right! I think too highly of myself! I’m a commoner Cinderella, and your cousin is a prince of a high and mighty family. How can a person with a low status like me be worthy of him? An Lizi! Anyone can look down on me, but you can’t! We grew up together. If My status is low, how good can you be?” ”

“In other words, an Lizi had no right to look down on her! ”

“”Qingqing, I really didn’t mean that. I’ve already apologized to you. What more do you want me to do?” ”

“”You really want to apologize, don’t you?”Zhang Qingqing asked. ”

“Yes.”An Lizi nodded.

“”Then I’ll give you a chance.”Zhang Qingqing continued, “Tomorrow, you invite your cousin out. We’ll go shopping together.” ”

An Lizi’s expression was a little awkward.

“”Fine, I know your answer. You still look down on me, right? If you look down on me, so be it! What’s there to be afraid of? You’re now the daughter of a rich family, and I’m just a gold digger who can’t stand up to the public. It’s understandable that you look down on me!”Zhang Qingqing mocked herself, but she didn’t show any mercy at all. ”

She was a gold digger.

What’s wrong with being a gold digger!

She was an honest gold digger. She didn’t want someone who was clearly a gold digger to hypocritically say that it was because of love! Because of love can marry a few decades older than his old man?
