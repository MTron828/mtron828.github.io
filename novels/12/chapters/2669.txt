Translator: 549690339

“Ye Zao was a doctor and was quite familiar with the s galaxy. If she said that there was no problem, there would definitely be no problem. ”

Ye Shu nodded. “Zao Zao just happened to be at home. I’ll get her to call and ask her to come over.”

“Okay.”

“After saying that, ye Shu immediately contacted ye Zao. ”

“Very soon, ye Zao arrived. ”

“”Mom, is there something you need me for?” ”

“Ye Shu nodded. “Zao Zao, sit down first.” ”

Ye Zao sat on the sofa.

Ye Shu told them about the matter. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Upon hearing this.., ye Zao said, “It’s indeed not suitable for a full moon baby to go to the s galaxy because many of the baby’s organs have not fully developed yet. Their resistance is much weaker than that of a normal person. If you insist on bringing them there, you will take a great risk. You have to consider this carefully.” ”

“It was a long journey to the s galaxy and it would take three days to reach it. After all, a child was still a child and their endurance was not as good as an adult’s. ”

“Hearing this, Bai Jingshu frowned slightly and continued, “Then, Zao, do you have any other ideas?” ”

“Not at the moment.”Ye Zao shook his head slightly.

“After saying this, ye Zao continued, “You can bring the old man over.” ”

“Bai Jingshu said, “Grandfather is old, so it’s not convenient to bring him over. He doesn’t want to come over either.” ”

“She was afraid that something might happen to grandfather Bai on the way here or on the way back. The old man was old, so anything could happen. ”

“”Zao Zao, when can we bring the baby back?”Lin Ze asked. ”

“Ye Zao said, “Yes, at least three months later.” ”

“Three months?”Lin Ze frowned.

“”Yes, that’s the shortest time.” ”

Lin Ze turned to look at Bai Jingshu. “What should we do?”

Bai Jingshu shook her head.

“Ye Shu continued, “Jingshu, why don’t you leave the baby with your father and me? You and Ah Ze can go back and visit your grandfather.” ”

The child had just reached the full moon. They couldn’t let him take such a big risk.

Bai Jingshu nodded. “That’s the only way now.”

“After saying that, Bai Jingshu looked at ye Zao and asked, “Zao, what will happen if I bring the baby back?” ”

“Ye Zao said, “There will be a mutation.” ”

“Once there was a mutation, the child couldn’t be defined as a human. ”

“Hearing that, Bai Jingshu’s face turned pale. “Is the probability high?” ”

“”About 90% ,”ye Zao continued, “And 10% depends on luck.”If Luck wasn’t good, it would be 100% . ”

“Ye Shu said, “Then forget it, Jingshu. You and Ah Ze go back and see grandfather. Your father and I will take care of the child at home.” ”

“Bai Jingshu still didn’t want to give up. She continued, “Zao, is there no other way?” ”

Old Master Bai’s only wish now was to take a look at the child. Bai Jingshu didn’t want him to have any regrets in his life.

“”Not for the time being,”ye Zhuozhuo continued, “The main thing is that the baby is too young. If it were a little older, it wouldn’t be a big deal to wear an isolation suit.” ”

Bai Jingshu sighed. “Grandfather’s health is getting worse by the day. I’m afraid that he’ll wait until three months later.”

“Ye Shu continued, “Jingshu, don’t think like that. Grandfather is a blessed person. He’ll definitely be able to see our little Tiezhu.” ”

“”Mom, I talked to grandfather’s attending physician the last time.”Bai Jingshu’s mood was a little down. “The Doctor said that he doesn’t have much time left.” ”

This was also the real reason why Bai Jingshu didn’t dare to bring grandfather Bai over.

“None of her uncles were reasonable. If something happened to old master Bai on Earth or on his way to Earth, then she wouldn’t be able to explain herself. ”

Ye Shu sighed softly. “But there’s nothing we can do now. We can’t risk our child.”

“After saying that, ye Shu continued, “Jingshu, don’t be anxious. It’s a taboo to be anxious during this month. Trust me, Old Master Bai will definitely be fine.” ”

Bai Jingshu nodded.

She was feeling very complicated right now and was beginning to understand why some parents did not allow their children to marry far away.

“Ye Shu continued, “Then, let’s do it this way. Jingshu, you rest well first. We’ll go back.” ”

“Okay.”Bai Jingshu nodded.

“Ye Shu, Lin Jincheng, and Ye Shu left the room. ”

“Bai Jingshu looked at Lin Ze. “Ah Ze, what should we do?” ”

“Lin Ze said, “Since the baby is too young to go, why don’t We Wait? I’ll go back with you first.” ”

“Bai Jingshu nodded. “Actually, I Just Want Grandpa to take a look at the baby.” ”

“Unfortunately, Earth and the s galaxy were too far apart, so there was no way to video-chat for the time being. Ye Shu and elder Bai had used energy stones previously, and now that they had used up all of them, it would be a luxury for elder Bai to meet the child. ”
