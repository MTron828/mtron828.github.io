Translator: 549690339

“Yang Jiao sighed helplessly and turned to look at Auntie Lang. “Sister, it’s alright. After we take her to see an old Chinese doctor, we won’t misunderstand you as a bad person for half a month.””

“Okay.”Auntie Lang nodded and walked upstairs.

Yang Jiao looked at Auntie Lang’s back and exchanged glances with Jiang Yan. They could see the smug look in each other’s eyes.

“Especially Yang Jiao, the smug look in her eyes was almost overflowing.”

Ye Langhua was such a talented girl from Glory World!

She was simply an idiot!

“After Auntie Lang went upstairs, Xi Muwen came down with the newspaper. “Is it done?””

“Yang Jiao nodded. “Don’t worry, it’s done.””

Xi Muwen nodded without batting an eyelid and then sat on the sofa to read the newspaper.

“Ten minutes later, Auntie Lang came down from upstairs. After breakfast, she was ready to leave.”

“Xi Muwen put the newspaper aside. “Lang Hua, where are you going? Coincidentally, I’m going to the office too. Why Don’t you wait another ten minutes and I’ll give you a lift along the way?””

Auntie Lang shook her head. “There’s no need. The place I’m going to isn’t on the way to the office.”

“Xi Muwen nodded. “Alright then, you can go first.””

“Aunt Lang walked out the door. Just as she walked out of the Xi family Villa area, a Mercedes-benz stopped in front of Aunt Lang.”

The driver in a black uniform came out and opened the door respectfully. “Please.”

Aunt Lang bent down and got into the car. “Elder Zhang.” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Elder Zhang nodded. “Xi Muwen didn’t notice anything, right?””

Aunt Lang shook her head. “None of them know.”

“That’s good then.”Elder Zhang looked up and ordered the driver. “Go to the second hospital.”

“Elder Zhang knew the doctors in the second hospital, so it was more reliable to have acquaintances.”

“Then, elder Zhang turned to look at Aunt Lang, “If the appraisal results show that the person XI Muwen brought back is not half a month old, you can come back with me! I’ll continue to arrange for people to help you find half a month old. Don’t worry, their efficiency is definitely not inferior to yours!””

“After a long while, just when elder Zhang thought Aunt Lang would not reply to him, Aunt Lang nodded. “Okay.””

“Then it’s a deal!”Elder Zhang was overjoyed.

“MMM.”Aunt Lang nodded.

“In a short while, they arrived at the Second People’s Hospital.”

Elder Zhang brought Aunt Lang directly to the appraisal department.

“Because elder Zhang had acquaintances in the appraisal department, he did not need to wait in line to get a number. He just needed to take a sample to be appraised.”

“Elder Zhang.”A doctor in a white coat walked out of the office.

“Elder Zhang handed the sealed bag to the doctor. “Doctor Zhou, I’ll have to trouble you.””

“”This is my job. It’s not troublesome.”Doctor Zhou took the sealed bag and continued, “This appraisal will take about four hours. Why don’t the two of you go and do other things first?””

Aunt Lang shook her head. “No need. I’ll wait here.”

“”Alright then.”Doctor Zhou continued, “Please follow me to the VIP room.””

Aunt Lang and old Zhang followed Doctor Zhou to the VIP room.

Waiting was the most torturous time.

Aunt Lang looked at the clock on the wall again and again.

One Hour.

Two hours.

Aunt Lang was anxious.

“Elder Zhang smiled and said, “Lang Hua, you don’t have to be so anxious. Sit Down and play with your phone.””

“Aunt Lang sighed. “It’s already at this time, how can I still have the mood to play with my phone?””

“”It’s futile for you to be anxious.”Elder Zhang continued, “There’s still more than an hour before the four hours that Doctor Zhou said.””

Aunt Lang could only sit down patiently.

“Time passed by minute by minute. Just as Aunt Lang was feeling like a year, four hours finally passed.”

“However, there was no movement from Doctor Zhou’s side.”

“Why isn’t Doctor Zhou Here Yet?”Aunt Lang looked outside from time to time.

“Doctor Zhou said about four hours. It’s only been four hours. He might still be busy! He might come in a while!”

Aunt Lang nodded.

Just as Aunt Lang was about to sit down and continue waiting...

Creak —

The VIP room door was pushed open.

Doctor Zhou walked in with the appraisal results. “Elder Zhang.”

“”Doctor Zhou, How’s the appraisal result?”Aunt Lang asked impatiently.”

Doctor Zhou handed the appraisal result to Aunt Lang. “Take a look for yourself.”

“Aunt Lang received the appraisal result with trembling hands. When she saw that the parent-child relationship was established in black and white, she couldn’t help but burst into tears.”

That’s great!

That’s really great!

That was her half a month.

“”What’s wrong, Lang Hua? Don’t Cry!”Seeing Aunt Lang suddenly burst into tears, elder Zhang was shocked. “What’s the result?””
