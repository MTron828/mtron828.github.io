“After all, the title of the first princess of Manxing Kingdom did not come for nothing. ”

“Manxing smiled and continued, “Actually, I still hope that I can look like my eldest sister.” ”

Ye Zhuo was miss ye of Changyue Kingdom.

“Now, she had completely disappeared from the s galaxy. ”

“If at this time, someone investigated and found out that she was ye Zhuo’s twin sister, it would not do her any harm. ”

However...

The risk of doing so was a little high.

“If ye Zao suddenly returned, the loss would outweigh the gain. ”

“After a while, man xing sighed and said, “Elder sister is my idol!” ” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“”What kind of idol is she?”Zhao Dan said firmly, “Xing ‘er, believe me, one day, you will be a hundred times better than her.” ”

“Ye Zao, a jinx, could become like this. ”

“Moreover, man Xing was a born lucky star. ”

“MAN XING smiled and said, “I will be satisfied if I can live half as long as elder sister.” ”

How could ye Zhuo’s current achievements be achieved by her?

She had received the best education ever since she was young. She was well-fed and well-dressed.

“Ye Zhuo lived a homeless life. Logically speaking, she should be more outstanding than ye Zhuo. ”

But she...

Pa..

Man Xing silently broke the brush in her hand.

“Zhao Dan said, “Xing ‘er, don’t belittle yourself so much. In My Heart, you are the most outstanding. That little disaster can’t compare to you at all.” ”

...

“Soon, it was the eve of the family recognition banquet. ”

Old Lady Cen had someone send over a pile of beautiful gowns. She wanted to pick out the most beautiful one to give to Ye Zao.

“In Old Mrs. Cen’s view, Ye Zao was the main character of this family recognition banquet. ”

Ye Zao had to make a high-profile appearance in order to put an end to those people’s messy thoughts.

“”I can’t even see what I’m Looking For!”Old Mrs. Cen massaged her temples. “Big Girl, Come and help me take a look.” ”

“”Grandma, what are you looking for?”Cen Yuying asked curiously. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen said, “I’m looking for a gown for Yezi. Which one do you think looks good?” ”

Cen Yuying looked at the gown on the hanger and pointed at a blue one-shouldered gown. “This is not bad.”

“”I feel that this dress doesn’t match Yezi’s temperament,”old Mrs. Cen said. ”

“What about this one?”Cen Yuying pointed at another one.

Old Mrs. Cen shook her head. “This one doesn’t work either! This one is too old-fashioned! It’s suitable for someone your age. Yezi is only so old!”

Cen Yuying:”...”it was heart-wrenching!

“Cen Yueya walked in from outside and smiled as she continued, “Grandma, don’t pick it. The searing beauty has a good temperament. It’s a natural hanger. Even if you wear a burlap sack, it’s the one that looks the best.” ”

“These words finally hit old Mrs. Cen’s heart. The old lady smiled and said, “Then this Red One!” ”

Ye Zao had never been picky.

“Moreover, she liked to challenge others. ”

She had turned some unpopular clothes into a trend.

“As it turned out, old Mrs. Cen’s judgment was very sharp. ”

“Red was originally a color that overtook the limelight, but when it was worn on ye Zao’s body, it was as if red was born for her. ”

“Cen Yueya smiled as she watched ye Zao walk out of the changing room. “Grandma, didn’t I tell you? Our Zao Zao looks good in everything!” ”

Old Lady Cen raised her head proudly. “It’s all because of my good taste in choosing a granddaughter-in-law.”

...

At the family identification banquet.

Duanmu Feng and Ye Han had just stepped into the hall when they were greeted with fawning flattery from all directions.

There were rumors that Leo and Ye Han were furious and would definitely support Duanmu Feng and Ye Han tonight.

“Although Duanmu Feng had fallen, her connections were still there. ”

“As long as the duanmu family did not fall, Duanmu Feng and her family would forever be the future First Lady of the alliance. ”

“Miss Duanmu is really beautiful tonight. She is simply stunning.”

“Duanmu Feng said humbly, “I don’t deserve to be called stunning. Miss ye is the one who is worthy of being called stunning.” ”

“Miss Ye? She is worthy of being called Miss Ye!”

“Just you wait! There will be a good show tonight!”

“At this moment, a strange movement came from the door. ”

“Hearing that, everyone looked back. ”

“They saw a tall figure walking over from there, followed by a few people carrying boxes. ”

“”Isn’t that Chief Ye’s assistant, Suiyue?” ”

“”Yes, it’s her.” ”

“I heard that Chief Ye prepared a full 100 million star dollars as a congratulatory gift for Miss Duanmu! And that doesn’t include the rare Grade-3 Armored Beast Bloodstone...”

“”It’s not just chief ye. I heard that the tribe leader of the Zerg, Leo, is also here!” ”

“There’s also the evil doctor!”

“I heard that there are also members of the JY team!”

“Duanmu fengyu listened from the side, and the curve of her lips became more and more obvious. ”

“She knew that she was quite popular, but she didn’t expect that so many people were willing to come and support her. ”
