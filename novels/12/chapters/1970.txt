Translator: 549690339

“Ye Zao said concisely, “It’s not a matter of distance.” ”

“If it’s not a matter of distance, then what is it? ”

It seemed that Mi Chen was right.

He ziteng most likely died on the operating table.

“Otherwise, ye Zao would not have stopped him from seeing he ziteng. ”

“Thinking of this, Xu Yao’s lips curled up. ”

“He ziteng, this idiot, was finally dead! ”

“Mother he continued, “Then can you shoot a video for us to see?” ”

Ye Zao nodded slightly. “I’ll get my assistant to arrange it later.”

“”Alright, Alright.”Mother he said, “Thank you, Miss Ye. We will remember your great kindness in our hearts.” ”

“”Mrs. He, don’t be in a hurry to thank me first.”Ye Zao’s tone was clear and shallow. “We’ll talk about everything in a week’s time.” ”

“Hearing that, mother he remembered what the director had said. ”

The director had said that he ziteng would only be truly safe after a week had passed.

“Ye Zhuo glanced at mother he and continued, “Mrs. He, you can go back with MR. He first. I’ll have my assistant inform you in a week’s time.” ”

It was useless for the he family’s parents to be in the hospital now.

“”Miss Ye, can you really not let me take a look at Ziteng before leaving?”Mother he asked. ”

“As a mother, she really could not let go of He ziteng. ”

“”I’m sorry, I can’t.” ”

“Mother he wanted to say something else, but Xu Yao continued, “Auntie, don’t make things difficult for Miss Ye. Let’s go back and wait for a week. I believe that Ziteng will definitely turn the situation around.” ”

Mother he nodded.

“After saying a few words to mother he, Ye Zhuo left the hospital with Cen Shaoqing. ”

“She had not eaten anything for almost a day. At this moment, she just wanted to sit in the dining room and feast. ”

“Knowing that she was hungry, Cen Shaoqing had booked the dining room before coming to the hospital. ”

“At this moment, she was sitting there eating. ”

He sat opposite her and looked at her.

“The bright crystal light shone on the side of her face, covering it with a layer of gauze. ”

It was exceptionally beautiful.

“Cen Shaoqing leaned back in his chair, holding a string of bright red Buddha beads in his hand. ”

“The steak today is not bad.”Ye Zhuo raised his eyes slightly and handed the steak to his mouth. “Try it.”

Cen Shaoqing opened his mouth and took it.

“It was delicate and soft. The meat was fresh, tender, and juicy. The taste was indeed not bad. Even Cen Shaoqing, who had never touched meat, thought it was not bad. ”

“Is it good?”Ye Zhuo asked.

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “It’s very good.”

“Then you want a piece too?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“”I’m not hungry,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Ye Zhuo quickly finished a piece of steak. “You only eat a little grass every day. There’s no oil at all. Are you really not hungry?”

Cen Shaoqing ate more vegetarian food than people who lost weight.

“Three meals a day were vegetable salad. Ye Zhuo could not eat a single bite, but Cen Shaoqing ate with relish. ”

“I’m used to it.”

“People who ate vegetarian food all year round would feel nauseous when they smelled meat. When Cen Shaoqing went out to attend the banquet, the organizers would change all the main dishes of the banquet to vegetarian food. ”

“When those partners ate with CEN Shaoqing, they did not dare to order meat dishes because they were afraid of causing Cen Shaoqing to feel uncomfortable. ”

“In the past, who would dare to feed Cen Shaoqing Steak? ”

“”What a strange person,”ye Zao said. ”

“On the other side, mother he received a video message from Little Shen’s assistant. ”

“In the video, he ziteng was lying on the hospital bed with his eyes closed. His face was pale and no signs of life could be seen. ”

“In Xu Yao’s eyes, he ziteng was no different from a dead person. ”

“After seeing he ziteng’s video, mother he heaved a sigh of relief. She packed up her things and went home with Father He. ”

“Yaoyao.”Mother he looked at Xu Yao.

“”What’s wrong, Auntie?”Xu Yao asked. ”

“Mother he continued, “Come back with us.” ”

“Xu Yao hesitated for a moment before saying, “I want to wait for Ziteng to come back from the apartment.” ”

“Mother he said, “Come back with us. You’re a person with two bodies now, so it’s inconvenient for you to do anything. If you stay with me and your uncle, at least we can take care of you.” ”

“Speaking up to this point, mother he continued, “Don’t worry, we won’t mistreat you in terms of status. We’ll let you stay at home as Ziteng’s fiancée.” ”

“Hearing this, Xu Yao was extremely pleased with herself. ”

“Three months ago, mother he still despised her and felt that she wasn’t worthy of he ziteng. ”

“Three months later, when she stepped into the he family’s door again, she would be the future mistress! ”

This feeling of smacking her in the face was really great!

“Although Xu Yao was very proud in her heart, she did not show it on her face. Instead, she said hesitantly, “This… This isn’t good, Auntie.” ”
