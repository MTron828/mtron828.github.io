“”No, it’s probably too cold!”Lin Ze said. ”

“”You child, I’ve already told you to wear more clothes. It’s best to put on Long Johns! How can you wear so little when you’re walking on the ice! Hurry, Hurry, go back to the house! It’s warm in the house!” ”

“”Okay.”Lin Ze nodded and walked into the house. “Mom, come in too. I have something to tell you and Dad.” ”

“What do you have to say in front of your dad and me?”Ye Shu asked.

“”You’ll know when you come in.”Lin Ze continued, “I just called searing. No one answered searing’s phone. Where did she go today?” ”

“Ye Shu said, “She went to the base. I heard that something went wrong with the aircraft carrier project! The signal inside is blocked, so she couldn’t get a call!” ”

“OH.”Lin Ze nodded. “Then we’ll talk to her when she comes back.”

“Ye Shu walked into the house with Lin Ze. “Ah Ze, what’s the matter?” ”

Lin Ze hadn’t said anything and still wanted to gather all the family members. This made ye Shu a little worried and felt that it wasn’t a good thing.

“”I’ll go to the study to call Dad!”Lin Ze turned to look at the maid. “Auntie Lan, please go and invite my grandmother over.” ”

“”Yes, Young Master!”Auntie LAN nodded. ”

“Seeing Lin ze like this, Ye Shu became even more anxious. ”

What exactly happened!

“Soon, Auntie Lan pushed Old Madam Lin over. Lin Jincheng also came down from the study room and the family gathered in the living room. ”

“Lin Ze looked at the few of them and said word by word, “Dad, mom, Grandma, I, I’m getting married.” ”

Getting Married!

Lin Ze was getting married!

“Ye Shu laughed out loud. “Ze! Are you kidding me? ! You Don’t even have a girlfriend, and you still want to Get Married? Dream On!”! ”

“”That’s right!”Lin Jincheng added, “And even if you have a girlfriend, you can’t get married so early. Do you know her? Do you know her? Ze, how old are you!” ”

“Old Madam Lin did not say anything. Looking at Lin Ze’s face, she felt that things were not that simple. ”

“Lin Ze continued, “She’s pregnant.” ”

Pregnant!

Who was pregnant?

“Lin Jincheng thought that he was hallucinating. “Ah Ze, what did you say? Who’s pregnant?” ”

Lin Ze did not say anything. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Ye Shu was immediately stunned. “Ah Ze! This joke is not funny at all!”

“I’m not joking.”Lin Ze’s face was expressionless. “She’s really pregnant. It’s been four weeks.”

Lin Jincheng was so angry that his face turned pale. He gave Lin ze a backhand slap.

This scene happened too quickly. Ye Shu quickly stood in front of Lin Ze and glared at Lin Jincheng. “Why did you hit the child? !”

Lin Jincheng sighed and blamed himself. “It’s my fault! It’s my fault! It’s my fault! It’s my fault for not teaching ze well...”

“Ye Shu knew that Lin Jincheng was not feeling well, she continued, “Now that things have happened, it’s useless even if you beat Ah Ze to death! When I gave birth to Ah Ze, I was only nineteen years old. Since ah ze proposed to get married, let’s Get Married!” ”

“Since things had already come to this, what else could they do? ”

They couldn’t possibly kill someone!

“After saying that, Ye Shu looked up at Lin Ze. “Ah Ze, does it hurt?” ”

“”No.”Lin Ze continued, “Mom, I really should have hit her!” ”

He shouldn’t have done that after drinking.

This was all his own trouble.

“Now that the situation had developed, Lin Ze didn’t want to find any excuses for his mistakes. ”

A mistake was a mistake. He would pay for his mistakes.

“”Ah Ze, where is she from?”Old Mrs. Lin asked. “How did you two meet?” ”

“Lin Ze looked at Old Mrs. Lin and continued, “She and Lizi are good friends. They grew up together. I only met her through Lizi.” ”

“Hearing this, old Mrs. Lin heaved a sigh of relief. She smiled and said, “If she’s good friends with Lizi, she must be a good child!”She had been a little worried that the other party had some ulterior motive for getting close to Lin Ze, but now it seemed that.., things were not as she had thought. ”

“An Lizi was a girl with a very good character. Lin Ze’s girlfriend was a good friend of an Lizi, so her character was definitely not that bad. ”

“”Since you’re pregnant, then let’s Get Married!”Thinking that she was about to be promoted to great-grandmother, Old Mrs. Lin was still a little happy. As she got older, she was looking forward to having more children in the family. ”

“Have you thought about getting married?”Lin Jincheng raised his head to look at Lin Ze. “Getting married isn’t just a formality! You’re only twenty years old this year!”

The times were different now. Very few young people got married and had children at the age of twenty.
