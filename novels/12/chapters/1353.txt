“As expected, the saying goes, ‘the mountains don’t turn and the waters don’t turn.’.”

“Although she had left ye Zhuo’s place, she had found a better place!”

Xiao Lu never dreamed that Tang Xue would personally invite her.

“”Of course.”Tang Xue smiled and said, “It’s my luck to be able to invite such an outstanding researcher like you.””

“Xiao Lu bowed 90 degrees to Tang Xue. “Researcher Tang, thank you!””

“”You’re welcome.”Tang Xue continued, “Come with me.””

Xiao Lu followed Tang Xue’s footsteps.

“Tang Xue said unintentionally, “Xiao Lu, how’s Miss Ye’s aircraft carrier project coming along? I heard that she’s going to create an aircraft carrier that exceeds the speed of light.””

“Xiao Lu said, “The aircraft carrier is huge. Whether it can successfully fly into the sky is still one thing, let alone exceed the speed of light.””

“Although Xiao Lu had joined ye Zao’s laboratory before this, she did not believe that ye Zao could create an aircraft carrier.”

That was an aircraft carrier!

It was not an ordinary aircraft.

Xiao Lu joined ye Zao’s laboratory because she had no way out and wanted to find a transitional job.

“Hearing this, Tang Xue narrowed her eyes. “Miss Ye is so amazing. I believe that she will definitely be able to realize the aircraft carrier plan and surpass the speed of light!””

“When she said the last sentence, even Tang Xue wanted to laugh.”

Surpass the speed of light?

“If it was really that easy to surpass the speed of light, then mankind would be the most invincible existence in the entire universe.”

Only ye Zhuo could say such words.

She really looked forward to the arrival of two years later.

“Xiao Lu shook her head, “I’ve stayed in the quality inspection department for many days. No one understands Miss Ye’s aircraft carrier project better than me. The structure of the aircraft carrier’s parts and components are not fundamentally different from other aircraft. Researcher Tang, I advise you not to have too much hope for her! After all, the greater the hope, the greater the disappointment!”” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Tang Xue was grateful to her. She did not want to see Tang Xue disappointed.

“This was Tang Xue’s true purpose of getting close to Xiao Lu. With Xiao Lu’s words, Tang Xue was relieved.”

“Not long after, they arrived at the Tang family’s laboratory.”

“Nie Gong.”

Old Nie walked out in his lab coat. “Miss Tang.”

“Tang Xue smiled and said, “Nie Gong, let me introduce you. This is Xiao Lu from the quality inspection department of Miss Ye’s research group. Xiao Lu has left the quality inspection department. You can arrange a suitable job for her.””

“Looking at Xiao Lu, old nie nodded.”

“After saying this, Tang Xue turned to look at Xiao Lu and said, “Xiao Lu, this is nie gong. He was a technician in Miss Ye’s research group before. I’ll let him take care of you in the future.””

“Nie Gong.”Xiao Lu bowed to old nie.

“Old nie smiled and said, “Come with me.””

“During this period of time, old nie was constantly glad that he had left ye Zhuo’s research team.”

He had found his true home with Tang Xue.

“After settling Xiao Lu down, old nie came to Tang Xue’s office. “Miss Tang.””

Tang Xue looked up. “The person has been arranged.”

“Old Nie said, “Xiaolu used to be in the quality inspection department, so I’ve arranged for her to be in the precision team.””

“Sure.”Tang Xue nodded.

“Old Nie rubbed his hands as if he had something to say, but when the words reached his mouth, he swallowed them back. He looked like he wanted to say something, but he hesitated.”

“Tang Xue put down the glass tube. “Nie Gong, if you have anything to say, just say it.””

“Old Nie looked at Tang Xue and continued, “Miss Tang, i... I have a presumptuous request.””

“Tang Xue smiled and said, “Nie Gong, you don’t have to be so polite when talking to me.””

“Seeing Tang Xue like this, old nie simply did not feel nervous anymore. “I want to recommend someone to you.””

Tang Xue raised her head. “Who?”

“Old Nie continued, “Zhou Dongyang.””

“Zhou Dongyang was a core member of Ye Zhuo’s research group. At the same time, he and old nie were very close friends.”

“Now that old nie had successfully left ye Zao’s place, Zhou Dongyang was still guarding ye Zao’s place.”

“To be friends, one had to be loyal.”

“Now that old nie had escaped from the sea of bitterness, he naturally couldn’t just leave Zhou Dongyang alone.”

“Tang Xue smiled and said, “Since Nie Gong has already spoken, I naturally can’t refuse. You Go and tell him that as long as he’s willing to come, I’ll let him take the position of Vice Minister.””

“”Miss Tang, thank you!”Old Nie was overjoyed.”

“He originally thought that Tang Xue would more or less make things difficult for him, but he did not expect Tang Xue to agree so readily.”

Who was Zhou Dongyang’s person?

He was from ye Zhuo’s research group!

“As long as it was someone from ye Zhuo’s side, Tang Xue would not reject anyone who came.”

“Tang Xue smiled and said, “You’re welcome.””

“After work, old NIE stood at the entrance of the base and waited for Zhou Dongyang.”

“From 9:30 to 10:30, everyone in the base was about to leave, but Zhou Dongyang was still nowhere to be seen.”
