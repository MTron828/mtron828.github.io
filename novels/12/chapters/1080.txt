Translator: 549690339

The live bullet screen exploded.

“[ F * ck! That’s Dr. Warne, right? I remember learning about him when I was studying modern history! ] ”

[ one above! I also learned about Dr. Warne. ]

[ who are those people next to Dr. Warne? ]

“[ Feiyu Squad! Those people who are studying nuclear bombs! With them, we don’t have to worry about the defense system on the aircraft carrier. ] ”

[ so many big shots have volunteered to join Dad’s research group. Let’s ask these reporters if their faces hurt! ]

“[ I’m afraid that even the reporters didn’t expect the situation to get out of control like this, right? ] ”

“Following that, the bullet screen was filled with the words ‘dad is mighty’. ”

The scene was also very quiet.

“Just as everyone was slightly stunned, another voice came from the entrance, “You guys are too much! Why didn’t you discuss this with Me First! Dr. YC, I wonder if I have the honor to join your research group with everyone?” ”

“As the camera slowly zoomed in, a straight figure slowly walked over. ”

Who Was This?

Dr. Millet!

Dr. Millet and Dr. Warne were the two giants of China’s science and technology industry. Her achievements had been incorporated into high school textbooks.

Such a big shot actually stood behind ye Zao without any hesitation.

“What was even more unexpected was that these big shots stood behind ye Zao, and their aura was actually much lower than ye Zao’s. ”

Invisibly.

Ye Zao had already guided everything.

[ it’s Dr. Millet! ]

[ I learned about Dr. Millet in high school too! I didn’t expect to see him on the live broadcast today! ]

[ the two giants of the tech world are gathered! ]

“[ wrong! It’s the three giants! YC’s dad is also a giant, okay? No! Dad should be a giant! ] ”

[ oh my God! I think I’m Dreaming! ]

“[ from left, it’s Dr. Warne, Dr. Millay, and then the Feiyu team. If anyone doesn’t know about the Feiyu team, they can go to Baidu. ] ”

[ even Dr. Millet is here! ]

“[ as expected, your father is still your father! YC is YC. If it were anyone else, would they be able to gather so many tech bigwigs? ] ”

“[ I just went to Baidu to search for the Feiyu team. Damn, they are so powerful. One nuclear bomb can blow up an island! I even went on an international kill warrant before. I didn’t expect such people to be conquered by my father! My father is really powerful! ] ”

“”Welcome,”ye Zhuo raised his eyes slightly and looked at the camera. His face was expressionless, and his tone was indifferent. “Dear reporters, is there anything else you want to ask?” ”

“Although his tone was indifferent, every word seemed to be stained with a biting cold, intimidating aura. ”

Click.

The reporter standing in front dropped the microphone in his hand on the ground. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

He didn’t know what to do.

The atmosphere was unusually quiet.

“Seeing this scene, the mocking smile on Tang Xue’s face disappeared completely. ”

“Ye Zao’s research group had a total of 58 members, and 29 of them had left in one night. In order to prevent those who had left from returning to Ye Zao’s Place, Tang Xue had specially arranged for these 29 people, each of them had a suitable place to go. ”

Who would have thought.

Who would have thought that Dr. Hua’en and Dr. Millet would bring a group of big shots from the science and technology industry to join ye Zao’s research team.

Were they crazy?

They actually believed that ye Zao could build an aircraft carrier.

Tang Xue frowned tightly.

“A reporter’s eyes were red, looking at the camera, he said, “I’ve been in the industry for so many years, but this is the first time I’ve seen such a passionate scene! I believe that under the leadership of Dr. YC, our Chinese science and technology will definitely reach a new peak!” ”

“Many of the reporters present had the same feelings, but they were so excited that they could not say anything. ”

“”Miss Ye!”Tang mi looked at ye Zao on the stage, covered her mouth, and almost screamed. ”

Cen Jiang looked at Old Nie who was not far away.

“At this moment, old NIE’s expression was very complicated. ”

He was now suspecting whether ye Zao could really develop an aircraft carrier.

“Otherwise, why would the big shots of the technology industry even come out? ”

“The remaining researchers were full of confidence in ye Zao. “Fortunately, we didn’t leave! Otherwise, we would have missed the opportunity to cooperate with Dr. Warne and Dr. Millet!” ”

“And the Feiyu team of the technology industry! Their members are the people I admire the most!”

[ oh my God! This Moment is so exciting! ]

[ I really like this face slap. ]

[ these reporters are all stunned. ]
