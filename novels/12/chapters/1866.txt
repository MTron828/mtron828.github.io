“After saying this, Xu Chaonan turned around and walked upstairs. ”

“If Xu Yao was a smart child, she would definitely make the right choice. ”

“Mother Xu looked at Xu Chaonan’s back and narrowed her eyes. After a moment, she turned to look at Xu Yao and said worriedly, “Does your aunt really have a boyfriend?” ”

Xu Yao shook her head. “I don’t know.”

“Mother Xu frowned. “No, no, I have to call your father!” ”

“Very soon, the call was answered. ”

“Father Xu was at the gambling table. When he heard what mother Xu said, he said nonchalantly, “Wait for me to come back first.” ”

“In the current situation, nothing was more important than gambling. ”

“Mother Xu was almost angered to death by Father Xu. She cursed loudly, “We’ll talk about it when you come back! We’ll talk about everything when you come back. If we really wait for you to come back, it’ll be too late! Looking at your sister’s appearance today, it seems like she still cares about that man! If she really marries someone, I’ll see what you’ll use to gamble in the future! Don’t forget, the person who holds the financial power in our family is your sister!” ”

“Father Xu said impatiently, “Isn’t it just finding a boyfriend? It’s not like she hasn’t found a boyfriend in the past. What’s The Big Deal?” ”

“In the past, Xu Chaonan had found at least ten boyfriends. ”

But every one of them was gone.

“All of this, of course, had to be attributed to these two. ”

Because the Xu family couldn’t do without Xu Chaonan.

The Xu family’s assets were all theirs!

“Other than them, no one else could dream of snatching the assets from them! ”

“Hearing this, mother Xu heaved a sigh of relief and continued, “Then when will you be back?” ”

“”We’ll see.”After saying that, father Xu directly hung up the phone. ”

“Immediately, a gambler beside him asked, “Who called?” ”

“An insensible Old Woman! Don’t bother about her!”Father Xu picked up the dice.

On the other side.

“After mother Xu hung up the phone, she looked up at Xu Yao and continued, “Yaoyao, don’t Let Your Aunt Lead You Astray! Do as mother says.” ”

“What if someone finds out?”Xu Yao asked.

“”This matter is known by the heavens and the earth. Who else would know?”Mother Xu continued, “Can I betray you? Calculate the ovulation period and quickly decide on this matter!” ”

The ovulation period was relatively easier to conceive.

“How do you calculate the ovulation period?”Xu Yao asked.

“Mother Xu said, “From about 14 days before the next menstrual period.” ”

Xu Yao frowned slightly. “Is this accurate?”

“”It should be about right.”Mother Xu held Xu Yao’s hand, “Yaoyao, you must not miss he ziteng. He ziteng is already 29 this year. I heard that the he family’s parents have long been eager to have a grandchild. If you can have a child, you will definitely become the treasure of the He family.” ”

“Xu Yao nodded. “Mom, I already know what you said. Please let me think about it again.” ”

“Although what mother Xu said was very reasonable, Xu Yao still couldn’t get over the hurdle in her heart. ”

“She, Xu Yao, was a famous person after all. How could she be reduced to using such underhanded methods? ”

“Moreover, what Xu Chaonan said was also reasonable. ”

“If she married into the he family for the sake of material life, she might as well think of ways to become stronger. ”

Nothing could compare to relying on herself.

“Xu Yao was born from her. Mother Xu knew clearly what Xu Yao was thinking, then, she said, “Do you think the he family’s current status can be achieved overnight? Stop Dreaming! No matter how hard you work, you can’t reach the He family’s status! Your aunt said it so nicely and thought that she was a strong woman. Then why can’t she bring our Xu family to squeeze into one of the top ten wealthy families?” ”

“At this point, mother Xu snorted coldly and continued, “She can’t even be compared to the top ten aristocratic families, yet she still thinks that she can be compared to the he family. Do you think she’s Dreaming?” ”

“When these words came out, Xu Yao was immediately stunned! ”

She had to admit that what her mother said was very reasonable.

“Xu Chaonan’s words were filled with passion, but he did not know how difficult it was to reach the height of the He family! ”

“If everyone could easily succeed, then fame and fortune would not be fame and fortune. ”

“Seeing the change in Xu Yao’s expression, he continued, “I think your aunt is jealous of you and doesn’t want you to marry into a rich family! Look at her, she’s already so old and still can’t get married! Seeing that you’re about to marry into the he family, doesn’t she feel bad? Yaoyao, don’t fall for her trick! Although she looks like she dotes on you on the surface, you didn’t crawl out of her stomach after all! She would never treat you with sincerity! In this world, the only people who can treat you with sincerity are your father and me!” ”

“Xu Yao nodded. “Yes, I understand, mother. Don’t worry, I know what to do.” ”

“Seeing Xu Yao like this, mother Xu heaved a sigh of relief. ”

She was really afraid that Xu Yao would be led astray by Xu Chaonan and give up on a high-quality man like he ziteng.

“If she really gave up on he ziteng, Xu Yao would regret it for the rest of her life. ”

At the CEN residence.

Ye Zhuo woke up again. It was already past three in the afternoon.

Cen Shaoqing handed her a glass of water. “What did you see this time?”

Ye Zhuo shook her head slightly. “I didn’t see anything.” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“You didn’t see anything?”Cen Shaoqing frowned.

“Yeah.”Even ye Zhuo was stunned.

“She thought that she would definitely remember something this time, but she didn’t remember anything. ”

“Cen Shaoqing put away the spirit pendulum and continued, “Lie down first.” ”
