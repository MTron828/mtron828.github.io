“Ye Shu hugged little tiezhu and continued, “Did the doctor say how much a normal child weighs?” ”

“Bai Jingshu replied, “Around 10-15 kilograms.” ”

“”Then our little Tiezhu is only three kilograms overweight.”Ye Shu turned to look at Bai Jingshu, then, she said, “Jingshu, if you control the baby’s weight, you must not lose too much at once. If you lose too much at once, the child will definitely not be able to take it.” ”

“Bai Jingshu nodded. “Don’t worry, Mom. I know.” ”

“As soon as she said that, Bai Jingshu seemed to have thought of something and asked, “Oh right, Mom, how are things at Home?” ”

“”It’s fine,”ye Shu said. ”

“That’s good.”

“”Dad, Mom, brother, sister-in-law, you guys are at home. I’ll go out for a while.”Ye Zhuo took his phone and walked out. ”

“Ye Shu turned around and looked at Ye Zhuo. “It’s already so late. Zhuozhuo, where are you going?” ”

“Ye Zhuo said, “Pingting is going out of town tomorrow. We’re going out for a gathering tonight.” ”

“Lizi is going too?”Ye Shu asked.

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “Yes.”

“OH.”

“Lin Jincheng continued, “You girls have to pay attention to your safety outside. Try not to drink alcohol. If it’s inconvenient to drive when you’re back, give me a call. I’ll pick you up.” ”

“”Okay, Dad.”Ye Zhuo changed into his white shoes. “I’ll be leaving first.” ”

The car was parked outside.

Ye Zhuo opened the driver’s seat door and sat inside.

“Soon, the black sports car disappeared into the night. ”

“Half an hour later, ye Zhuo parked the car in the parking lot near the night market. ”

“Sear Sear!”

“As soon as the car stopped, Zhao Pingting waved her hand and ran over. ”

“”Pingting, why are you here so early!” ”

“Zhao pingting smiled and said, “No, I just parked the car and saw you!” ”

“Where’s Lizi?”Zhao Pingting continued to ask.

“Didn’t she send a message in the group chat when I first set off? She should be here soon!”Ye Zao said.

Zhao Pingting took out her phone. “Let me see where she is now.”

“After that, Zhao Pingting sent a message to the group of three. [ I’m here with Big Zao! Where are you, Lizi? ] ”

“An Lizi was waiting for the traffic light. When she saw Zhao Pingting’s message, she immediately replied, [ right away! Go and order some food before drinking a cup of tea. Wait for me. ] ”

“[ okay, drive slowly. Don’t be anxious. ] ”

“After replying to an Lizi’s message, Zhao Pingting looked up at Ye Zhuo. “Lizi said that she’ll be here soon. She wants us to order first.” ” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“After an Lizi replied to the message, the traffic light at the intersection ahead turned green. An Lizi released the handbrake and the car slowly drove forward. ”

Bang!

“At this moment, a rolls-royce suddenly rushed over from the right intersection. ”

Chi!

An Lizi slammed on the brakes.

Her car had been hit.

“After realizing this problem, an Lizi immediately opened the door and got out of the car. “What’s wrong with you? Are You Blind?” ”

“”I’m sorry, Ma’am. I didn’t do it on purpose. Don’t worry, I’ll Take Full Responsibility.”The Rolls-royce driver was a middle-aged man with white gloves on his hands. From the looks of it, he was a professional driver. ”

“Seeing this, an Lizi’s attitude softened a little. She continued, “Uncle, do you know that you just ran a red light? It’s very dangerous to do this at an intersection!” ”

“You mean...”

“Before the driver could finish his sentence, the back seat door of the Rolls-royce was opened by someone. A well-built figure in a suit walked out. “Miss an.” ”

It was a very deep voice.

It sounded a little familiar.

“An Lizi looked up and said in surprise, “Boss song!” ”

“Song Shiyu nodded slightly and continued, “I felt that the voice sounded a little familiar when I was in the car just now. I didn’t expect it to really be you.” ”

“”I didn’t expect it either,”an Lizi said. ”

“Song Shiyu looked at an Lizi. “Miss an, I’m really sorry. My driver just started his shift. Don’t worry, I’ll take care of the car’s repairs.” ”

An Lizi turned to look at the car. “I’m afraid my car won’t be able to drive.”

Song Shiyu’s car had just stuck to the back of her car.

“The entire back of the car had caved in. If not for the chauffeur braking in time, she would already be lying in a hospital bed. ”

“Song Shiyu continued, “Miss an, where are you in such a hurry to go? I can send you over first and get my people to...” ”

“”A week ago.”Song Shiyu continued, “Miss an, if you’re not in a hurry, let’s find a place to sit and discuss the car maintenance.” ”

“”I’ve arranged to have dinner with Zhuozhuo and the others. Oh right, has boss song eaten yet?” ”

“”Not yet,”song Shiyu said. ”

“An lizi smiled and said, “Since you’re not, then you can come with us. When we’re done eating, we can still drive together.” ”

Song Shiyu hesitated for a moment. “That’s fine too.”

“”Then let’s go.”An Lizi continued, “Drive Your Car?” ”

“Yes.”Song Shiyu nodded slightly. “I’ll inform the driver.”

“An Lizi said, “Alright.” ”

Song Shiyu turned around and whispered a few words to the driver.

“The driver said respectfully, “Alright, don’t worry. I understand.” ”

“Song Shiyu walked to an Lizi’s side. “Miss an, let’s go.” ”

“Okay.”An Lizi nodded and followed song Shiyu into the rolls-royce.

“The driver turned into song Shiyu, and an Lizi sat in the passenger seat. ”

“Where’s the address?”Song Shiyu turned his head and asked.

An Lizi adjusted the navigation. “Just follow the navigation.”

“Okay.”

“About ten minutes later, the two of them arrived at the agreed location. ”

It was a night market.

The place was bustling with people and the air was filled with the smell of fireworks.

Song Shiyu’s gaze scanned the surroundings for a few times before he averted his gaze.

This place suited her style.

“Do we need to find a place first?”Song Shiyu turned his head to look at an Lizi and asked.

“An Lizi was looking around for an Lizi when she suddenly saw ye Zhuo talking and laughing with Zhao Pingting. She smiled and said, “Found it, found it. Mr. Song, Let’s go over there.” ”

Song Shiyu followed an Lizi’s line of sight and looked over.

“As expected, he saw ye Zhuo. ”

“In the crowd, she was wearing a simple white t-shirt, jeans, and hot pants. Her hair was tied up into a bun. ”

“Simple, but not simple. ”

“Zha Zha!”An Lizi waved at them excitedly. “Pingting!”

“”Lizi, over here!”Zhao Pingting immediately waved her hand in response. “Zha Zha, look at the person beside Lizi. He looks so much like brother song!” ”

Mr. Song?

“Hearing this, Ye Zha turned around and indeed saw song Shiyu’s figure. ”

Zhao pingting frowned slightly. “I forgot to wear my glasses when I went out today. Did I see wrongly?”

“I didn’t see wrongly. It’s him.”

“The two of them got closer and closer. Zhao pingting asked curiously, “Lizi, why are you here with Brother Song?” ”

“Zhao Pingting and song Shiyu had been driving black more often, so they addressed each other more intimately. ”

“An Lizi explained, “My Car and Mr. Song’s car had a little friction at the traffic light junction, so we came together.” ”

“Song Shiyu stood behind them and greeted them, “Ye Zhuo, Pingting, do you mind if I join you for a free meal?” ”

“”No, no,”Zhao Pingting said with a smile. ”
