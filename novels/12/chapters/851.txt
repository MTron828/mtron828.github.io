“Once Zhou Rui took care of Cen Yuyan, she would have another helper in the Cen family. ”

This was killing two birds with one stone for song Chenyu.

“Zhou Rui looked at song Chenyu. “This is the Cen family’s fourth miss! CEN fifth Master’s biological sister, you want me to take care of her? What kind of international joke is This!”Although Zhou Rui recognized his looks, song Chenyu was still the Cen family’s daughter, after all, the other party was the Cen family’s daughter. ”

“”Cen Yuyan is my best friend.”Song Chenyu continued, “As long as you do as I say, in less than a month, she will take the initiative to pursue you.” ”

“Is that true?”Zhou Rui did not dare to believe it.

“Of course it’s true.”

“Zhou Rui picked up the photo on the table and looked at it carefully. Suddenly, he felt that something was wrong. “CEN fifth master is already 31 this year. Doesn’t that mean that his sister is even older?” ”

Song Chenyu did not deny it. “Cen Yuyan is 37 this year.”

“36?”Zhou Rui stood up from his chair. “You want me to serve a 37-year-old woman?”

Zhou Rui was only 20 this year.

Cen Yuyan was 17 years younger than him.

This made Zhou Rui somewhat unable to accept it.

“After all, he had dated girls who were only 18 or 19 years old. ”

Cen Yuyan could already be his mother at this age!

Song Chenyu raised his head and looked at Zhou Rui. “Being able to get close to Cen Yuyan is something that no one can hope for. You shouldn’t be ignorant of your fortune. Do you know how much Cen Yuyan’s net worth is?”

“”When you’re with her, not only will your status rise with the tide, but your entire family will also rise with the tide.”Speaking up to this point, song Chenyu paused, then, he continued, “Compared to the CEN family, a small celebrity like me is nothing. In any case, you only have one chance. Think about it carefully.” ”

“Hearing this, Zhou Rui was stunned. ”

Song Chenyu was right.

“Compared to the CEN family, what was song Chenyu? ”

“If he could become the CEN family’s son-in-law, then even fifth master CEN would have to be respectful to him. ”

Besides.

“As long as he had money, what kind of woman would he want to play with? ”

“When he thought of this, Zhou Rui’s eyes were filled with pride. ”

“”Alright, I’ll listen to you.”Zhou Rui continued, “Do you really have a way to make Cen Yuyan chase after me?” ”

Being chased by Cen Yuyan and him taking the initiative to chase after Cen Yuyan were two different concepts. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“”Just listen to me.”Song Chenyu continued, “I’ll contact you when I go back.” ”

No one knew Cen Yuyan better than she did.

Song Chenyu knew clearly what Cen Yuyan liked and disliked.

“As long as she made a move, CEN Yuyan would not be able to escape. ”

“After meeting Zhou Rui, song Chenyu returned to the hotel. ”

“After settling Zhou Rui’s matter, song Chenyu was in a very good mood. He poured himself a glass of red wine and planned to celebrate. ”

“After drinking the red wine, song Chenyu checked Cen Yuyan’s recent schedule. ”

“Three days later, Cen Yuyan would be attending a celebrity party. ”

Perhaps.

This was a chance.

She had to think of a way to let Zhou Rui get the admission ticket.

“As a big star, it was not difficult for song Chenyu to get the admission ticket after he had helped song Chenyu accumulate a lot of connections in the circle. ”

“Therefore, song Chenyu easily got the admission ticket to the party. ”

“After getting the admission ticket, Song Chenyu met Zhou Rui again and conveniently told him some things. ”

“”Cen Yuyan is arrogant and conceited. She’s too smart. Because she’s the Cen family’s fourth young miss, she’s been pampered since she was young. All these years, with her family background, she’s gained countless suitors. As long as you act different from other men, she’ll definitely notice you.” ”

“Zhou Rui looked at song chenyu and asked doubtfully, “How is it different?” ”

The corners of Song Chenyu’s mouth curled up slightly. “Do the opposite.”

Do the opposite?

Zhou Rui still found it hard to understand. “Don’t give me such cultured words. Just tell me what to do.”

“Song Chenyu cursed ‘idiot’in his heart and continued, “You have to ignore her, despise her, and look down on her.” ”

“This time, Zhou Rui understood. ”

Wasn’t this playing hard to get?

“He only knew that women often played hard to get with men, but he did not expect that men could also use this trick on women. ”

“Song Chenyu said, “Song Chenyu hates those gigolos who live off women. Before she falls for the trap, you’d better restrain yourself. Only women who fall in love have zero IQ.” ”

“”Oh right,”song Chenyu seemed to have suddenly remembered something. “Cen Yuyan likes Mr. Fujiino’s Virgo. After you go back, take a look at this work and search for some analysis online.” ”
