“It was a very simple line of words, but it revealed an unstoppable domineering aura. ”

“It was fine if ye Zhuo did not forward it, but once he forwarded it, the entire Weibo was paralyzed. ”

[ some internet celebrities are really funny! They even want to come and take advantage of this kind of topic! ]

“[ people are talking about tech guru Nehulu YC, not some random Sitara YC! Do you really think that you are a tech guru just because you have a YC in your ID? ] ”

“[ didn’t some people say that they didn’t want to be famous? If they really didn’t want to be famous, why did they even try to steal this kind of popularity? ] ”

[ I really doubt that her live broadcast account name was obtained by imitating YC! ]

“[ the person above, be more confident and remove the words ‘really doubt’. ] ”

“[ hahaha, I’m laughing so hard that my head is falling off! How can there be such a person? ] ”

“[ only winning and not losing? This is too stupid! Moreover, the human blogger didn’t talk about you. People are talking about Dr. YC! Are You a Doctor? ] ”

“[ I used to think that she was quite Buddhist and didn’t fight for it, but now I can see it! Disgusting! ] ”

[ this is even worse than Zhou Chenyu! ]

“Ye Zhuo didn’t think too much about it. After forwarding it to Weibo, she went to bed. She didn’t know that Weibo was directly paralyzed because of a Weibo post that she casually forwarded. ”

…

“In the blink of an eye, it was the second day. ”

The day of the press conference.

The press conference was held in the southern region of the base.

“Before the time was up, all the reporters had already arrived. ”

“After all, it was an aircraft carrier! ”

“Currently, no technology bigshot had said that they could build an aircraft carrier. Niu Hulu was the first. ”

“Therefore, everyone was very excited and wanted to get their hands on some first-hand news. ”

“Tang Xue looked at the reporters surrounding the southern region and turned to look at her assistant. “Ruth, come over here for a moment.” ”

Ruth walked over to Tang Xue.

Tang Xue leaned into Ruth’s ear and whispered something in her ear.

“Hearing this, Ruth nodded. “Alright, I know what to do.” ”

“Go.”

Ruth walked towards the south side.

“Not long after, an explosive piece of news spread among the reporters. ”

“Ye Zhuo’s aircraft carrier project had just begun, and 29 out of 58 researchers had left! ”

“However, no one believed that this was real. ”

“After all, the other party was the Dr. YC of the scientific and technological world. Could it be that he did not even have this little bit of charisma? ”

10:10 am.

The press conference officially began.

Cen Shaoqing stood on the stage and presided over the press conference.

“”Cen Wuye, may I ask if it’s true that the CEN base and Dr. YC collaborated to create the aircraft carrier project?” ”

“It’s true.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“”Then why is Dr. YC still nowhere to be seen even after the press conference has started?”The reporter continued to ask, “I heard that Dr. YC’s research group had lost half of their advanced researchers when the aircraft carrier project had just started. How long do you think the remaining half of the advanced researchers will last?” ”

“Is the reason why Dr. YC hasn’t appeared in the press conference for a long time because of the influence of the group of researchers leaving?”

The Reporters’questions came one after another.

“Cen Shaoqing stood on the stage, twirling the Buddha beads as he methodically answered everyone’s questions. ”

“”It’s already 10:20 am, and Dr. YC still hasn’t arrived. May I ask if she’s Afraid?” ”

Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly. He was about to say something when his gaze suddenly passed over the reporters and looked towards the entrance.

The coldness in his eyes gradually faded.

Everything came back to life.

“Seeing Cen Shaoqing like this, the reporters who were asking questions also turned back to look. ”

They saw a detailed figure walking towards them step by step from the entrance.

Her figure was graceful.

It was cold and chilly.

“When the reporters who were surrounding the entrance saw her coming over, they all automatically made way for her. ”

Who Was She?

“Ye Zhuo had only appeared in the science and technology industry, and many people had never seen her before. ”

“Isn’t this Sitara Leaf?”

“”She was on country 2!”Soon, someone recognized ye Zhuo. ”

“Oh! I know! She’s CEN Fifth Master’s girlfriend! Didn’t Cen fifth master announce it last time?”

“She seemed to have retweeted Big V’s Weibo to gain popularity last night. I didn’t expect that she would come directly to the venue today! Her eating style is really ugly.”

“After recognizing ye Zao, everyone started to discuss animatedly. ”

Today’s press conference was broadcast live.RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Seeing ye Zao come over, the bullet screen exploded. ”

“[ yesterday, she gained popularity on Weibo. Today, she gained popularity on the spot again! There is no one like her! Why is she so disgusting? ] ”

“[ even if she is Cen Wuye’s girlfriend, she doesn’t have to be so high-profile, right? This is a scientific research press conference, not in the entertainment circle! She wants to gain popularity too? ] ”

[ I can’t watch anymore either! ]

[ the whole screen is filled with awkwardness. ]

“[ I want to see Dr. YC! who wants to see her! Does she really think that just because she is pretty, she can do whatever she wants? ] ”

“[ one is Niu Hulu YC, and the other is Sitara YC. Do you guys think that these two are the same person? ] ”

“[ please, the one upstairs has some brains! Can an internet celebrity compete with a tech tycoon? Although Dr. YC is a little arrogant this time, her previous contributions to China are real! ] ”

“[ add 10,086! I also feel that an internet celebrity can’t compete with a technology tycoon. ] ”

-LSB- daWhy why would an internet celebrity like her join in the fun? ]

[ I’m Speechless! ]

“At this moment, the words on the bullet screen suddenly changed to ‘Daddy’and ‘Daddy is mighty’. ”

“[ a troll army, right? ] ”

[ it must be someone who hired a troll army! How disgusting! ]

“At this moment, ye Zao walked onto the stage and gently took the microphone from the reporter’s hand. “I’m sorry to disappoint everyone. I didn’t retreat at the last minute, nor did I run away.” ”

“The reporter who was taken out of the microphone was stunned. He stared blankly at ye Zao for a long time before he reacted. Then, he said, “Who, who are you?” ”

“Ye Zao just looked at the camera like that. His clear face was covered in a layer of snow. With a pause, he said, “Niu Hu Lu · YC.” ”

Niu Hulu · YC!

Who would have thought that ye Zao was actually Niu Hulu · YC?

The words on the bullet screen all changed to ‘F * ck!’!

“Not to mention the audience in front of the screen, even the reporters at the scene were stunned. ”

Sitara and Niu Hulu were actually the same person!

“”You, you just said that you are YC?”The reporter looked at Ye Zao and his voice was trembling. “The YC of Doctor YC?” ”

“”Yes.”Ye Zao’s tone was indifferent, “You didn’t hear wrong.” ”

“Ah Ah Ah! Daddy is so handsome!”

“Ye is so awesome!”

“This reversal is really a slap to the face!”

“I want to be a fan of father ye for a hundred years!”

“A thousand years.”

“”Mom, I’m doing well! The streamer that I’m a fan of is actually a big shot!” ”

“”From an internet celebrity to a technology big shot, this is definitely a master of Crossover!” ”

“After a long while, the reporters at the scene finally digested the fact that Ye Zao was Dr. YC. ”

“The reporters continued to ask, “Dr. YC, I heard that 29 out of the 58 researchers in the research group that you set up have left! is the loss of half of the members related to your incomplete aircraft carrier plan?” ”

“May I ask how you plan to fill the vacancies of these 29 members?”

“”Dr. YC, I heard that the researchers at the CEN’s base are avoiding your research team. Is that true?” ”

“Why can’t you convince them?”

Da Da da —

“At this moment, footsteps suddenly came from the air. “Dr. YC, I wonder if I have the honor to join your research team?” ”

“This is Dr. Warne!”Someone in the crowd recognized Dr. Warne.

Who was Dr. Warne?

His achievements could be recorded in history.

“”And me.”As soon as he said that, a second voice came. ”

“”Father YC, we also want to join your research team.” ”

“However, in the blink of an eye, a group of big shots who could shake the entire scientific and technological world with just a stomp of their feet stood in front of the camera. ”
