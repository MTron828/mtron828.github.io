Chapter 268: 099: he’s so handsome. Zhao Pingting’s parents know the truth

Translator: 549690339

Zhao Pingting’s mother was very angry.

“Zhao Yingjun said, “Mom, Pingting is still young and doesn’t have enough social experience. She’ll be fine when she grows up. Don’t be angry. I’ll go over and take a look.” ”

“After saying that, Zhao Yingjun ignored Zhao Pingting’s mother’s objections and walked into Zhao Pingting’s room. ”

“In the room, Zhao Pingting was also feeling very uncomfortable. ”

She was only 19 years old.

“She had yet to go to university, had yet to confess to the person she liked, and had yet to show her filial piety in front of her parents... ”

There were still many things in her life that she had yet to do.

Why.

Why did fate treat her like this?

She thought of her ending three months later.

Zhao Pingting hugged the blanket and covered her head as she cried.

“At this moment, there was a knock on the door. “Pingting.” ”

“At this moment, Zhao Yingjun’s voice sounded. ”

Zhao Pingting stood up and stopped crying. She took out a tissue to wipe her eyes and went to open the door. “Big Brother.” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“”Pingting, are you crying?” ”

“I’m fine.”Zhao Pingting sniffed and closed the door.

“Zhao Yingjun sat on the chair in front of the desk and looked up at Zhao Pingting. “Pingting, I don’t blame you today. What’s wrong with you? This is our family’s condition. How can you buy such expensive things?” ”

Zhao pingting lowered her eyes and didn’t say anything.

“Zhao Yingjun continued, “Mom is very angry. Go apologize to her and then return the things with her tomorrow.” ”

“”I said I won’t return them!”Zhao Pingting suddenly couldn’t control her emotions and looked up at Zhao Yingjun. “If you don’t like it, you can throw the things in the trash can!” ”

“”Zhao Pingting!”Zhao yingjun frowned and said, “Do you know that 28,000 yuan is two months’salary for your brother? But you squandered it on a trip to the mall.” ”

“Zhao Pingting looked at Zhao Yingjun and tried her best to keep her voice low, “Money, money, money! You only know money! is money omnipotent? can more money buy time and life? You haven’t figured out what is the most precious!” ”

“By the end of her sentence, Zhao Pingting was already in tears. ”

So what if she had money?

Could her cancer be cured with money?

“Zhao Yingjun frowned, “Zhao Pingting! Have you read too many books and damaged your brain? ! Money isn’t important! Without money, can you live in such a good house? Can you have the chance to go to the mall and squander today? Don’t keep your brain filled with those unrealistic mind poison chicken soup! I think you must be out of your mind!” ”

“Zhao Yingjun’s monthly salary was 14,000 yuan. ”

“His monthly expenses were 5,000 yuan. ”

“Adding in the usual dinner gatherings and treating colleagues to a few cups of milk tea, under normal circumstances, he could only save 7,000 yuan a month. ”

“It was only 84,000 yuan a year. ”

“Adding in his wife Tang Jia’s salary, their annual income added up to about 200,000 yuan. ”

“The price of a house in Yunjing was 30,000 yuan per square meter. ”

Buying a three-bedroom house would cost at least 3.6 million yuan.

“He and his wife had been living frugally until now, but they had only saved 1.2 million yuan. ”

They were going to take out a loan to buy a house next month.

“The loan was 2.4 million yuan, which meant that they would be mortgage slaves for the rest of their lives. ”

“Therefore, he was very frugal. ”

He was wearing work clothes.

“Occasionally, he would buy a piece of clothing, but it would not cost more than 200 yuan. ”

“This time, Zhao Pingting bought him a suit, which cost more than 7,000 yuan. ”

“7,000 yuan, how many clothes did he have to buy? ”

Zhao Pingting’s mood was already unstable.

“Hearing Zhao Yingjun say that her brain was damaged from reading, she felt even more wronged. ”

If she had known earlier that she would get lung cancer.

Her life would have ended at the age of 19.

Why was she still reading?

“”Yes! You’re right! I’m Crazy! I only bought you gifts because my brain was damaged from Reading!”Zhao pingting cried, “Don’t worry! I will never give you gifts again!” ”

Never again.

Because there was no chance.

Zhao Pingting really wanted to tell her brother about this.

But she couldn’t.

“If her parents knew about this, they would definitely not be able to bear it. ”

“In the first 19 years, she had not done a single day of filial piety. ”

“In the last three months of her life, she could not let her parents suffer such pain. ”

“Hearing this, Zhao Yingjun’s tone softened a little, he continued, “Pingting, you are still young. It is normal that you do not understand many things. When you are older than me, you will know how hard it is to get money. “We’ve received the things you bought for us, but we can’t accept these things! “Ping Ting, listen to me. Go and apologize to Mom. Don’t make her angry.” ”
