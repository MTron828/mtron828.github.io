“Therefore, she had been adding birth control pills to Xia Xiaoman’s food. ”

“Although the dosage was small, Xia Xiaoman was old after all. It was already more difficult to conceive compared to young people, not to mention that there were drugs to prevent it. Therefore, Xia Xiaoman had been unable to conceive for a long time, but ye Zao had diagnosed it, xia Xiaoman had taken birth control pills before. ”

Sister-in-law sun was usually amiable and worked hard. Who would have thought that the problem was sister-in-law sun?

It was unheard of for a servant to give birth control pills to their master.

Let alone doubt it.

Others probably wouldn’t even dare to think about it.

“Sun Jiayi sat on the chair and said worriedly, “What if Xia Xiaoman finds out?” ”

“”She won’t.”Auntie sun smiled and said, “She trusts me. She even gave me a raise yesterday.” ”

“Really?”Sun Jiayi said in surprise.

“”Really, but who would want her ten thousand yuan! “When you become the mistress of this villa, we won’t have any money that we want!”! Auntie sun continued, “I heard that Mr. Lin’s hometown is even richer. His younger brother is called Lin Jincheng, the boss of the Lin Group. His daughter is a doctor or the head of some financial group. In short, she is rich and powerful! “Jiayi, you have to work hard and seize the opportunity. If you miss the chance, you won’t be able to hide from the rain! “After this village, there won’t be such a shop anymore!” ”

“One person had achieved enlightenment, and the whole family ascended to heaven. ”

“As long as Sun Jiayi could give birth to a son for Lin Qingxuan, then the entire Sun family would benefit from it. ”

“Sun Jiayi smiled and said, “Don’t worry, Mom. Am I not as good as an old woman?” ”

Xia Xiaoman was old enough to give birth to her.

Which man didn’t like young girls?

Could it be that Lin Qingxuan was a freak?

“Therefore, Sun Jiayi was very confident in himself. ” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Sun Jiayi took the family photo and continued, “Mom, who is this woman? She is so beautiful and the man beside her is so handsome!” ”

“Auntie Sun took a look and said, “She is Lin Jincheng’s daughter, Ye Zhuo. The man beside her is her boyfriend.” ”

“Her surname is Ye?”Sun Jiayi frowned. “She’s also a stepdaughter?”

“Auntie Sun shook her head. “She’s not a stepdaughter. She and Lin Jincheng are biological women. It’s said that she grew up with her mother when she was young, so she took her mother’s surname.” ”

Sun Jiayi nodded. “I see.”

“After saying that, Sun Jiayi said with envy, “This heiress is really good. She can marry such a handsome man!”Unlike her, she could only marry an old man who was more than 20 years older than her. She was not bad looking, and her studies were okay, if she had a good background, she would definitely be able to marry into a noble family of equal status. ”

It was a pity.

“It was a pity that she was born into the wrong family and actually became a servant’s daughter. Now, she could only make herself marry an old man! ”

“Thinking of this, Sun Jiayi sighed. ”

“Seeing her daughter like this, auntie sun said guiltily, “It’s all mother’s fault. Mother couldn’t let you have a good birth, so all these years, mother has been thinking of ways to make up for it.” ”

This was the chance to change her fate.

“Many years ago, Auntie Sun had sworn that she would never let her daughter become someone like herself. ”

Now.

This wish was about to come true.

On the other side.

C nation.

“Carl had used his connections to investigate for a long time, but he still couldn’t find out who the person who did this to him was. ”

In addition.

The surveillance camera in the apartment had disappeared.

It was obvious that someone had tampered with the surveillance cameras.

“Carl frowned and sent the video to his partner, Chris. ”

“Chris and Carl had been good friends for many years, and they were colleagues. Chris was extremely talented in computers, so it wouldn’t be difficult for him to fix some of the surveillance cameras. ”

He had just sent the video to Chris.

“Knock, knock — ”

There was a knock on the door.

Carl closed the lid on his laptop. “Come in.”

“The assistant came in. “Mr. Carl, the deputy is here to see you.” ”

Carl stood up from his chair. “I’ll be right there.”

Carl came to the deputy’s office.

The door to the deputy’s office was closed.

Carl reached out and knocked.

“Soon, the deputy’s voice came from inside. ”

Carl pushed the door open and went in.

“The deputy executive officer was sitting with his back to the door, so when Carl went in, he could only see his back. ”

“Subconsciously, Carl felt that there was something wrong with the deputy executive officer today, but he didn’t think much of it. “Deputy Executive Officer!” ”

“Mr. Carl.”The deputy executive officer turned his chair around.

“But what appeared in the air was a strange face, smiling at him. “Hello, Mr. Carl.” ”

Carl paused. “Who... Who Are You?”
