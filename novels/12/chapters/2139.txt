Old Mrs. Cen raised her walking stick and swung it at Cen Haifeng’s head.

“Just as the walking stick was about to fall, a hand suddenly grabbed it. ”

“”Old Lady, you can’t hit me!” ”

The person holding the walking stick was none other than the national master.

Old Mrs. Cen looked at the National Master. “Can’t hit me? Why Can’t You Hit Me? Let Go of me! Whether you let go or Not! What does it have to do with you that I’m disciplining my unfilial son?”

The National Master did not say anything. He just held the walking stick in Old Mrs. Cen’s hand.

“Old Mrs. Cen immediately pulled out the big knife that she had prepared earlier, “You’re not going to let go, are you? ! If I don’t let go of you, I’ll educate you as well! “What high-level civilization, high-level planet? I think you’re all just a bunch of motley crew. You actually did such a heartless thing and caused your families to be separated. You all need to be taught a lesson a long time ago!” ”

The box that she had used to store the large knife had been modified by Ye Zao. It could be shrunk at any size.

“The national advisor was shocked when he suddenly pulled out the large knife. He realized that old Mrs. Cen was not someone to be trifled with. He immediately let go of her walking stick and retreated far away. “Old Mrs. Cen, calm down, calm down...” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen raised her walking stick and hit Cen Haifeng’s back hard. “This time, I’m hitting you for abandoning your wife and children! You have to ask yourself, all these years, you have done right by Xiangxiang and the Children!” ”

Cen Haifeng did not say a word and did not resist.

“Even if there were thousands of reasons, he should not have forgotten about Zhou Xiang and the children. ”

“”This time, I’m hitting you for being unfaithful and unfilial!” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen used all her strength with every hit. Although the main alliance was a high-level civilized planet, Cen Haifeng was still a mortal. When the fifth hit hit hit hit, Cen Haifeng could not help but spit out a mouthful of blood. ”

The bright red blood mark on the ground was a bit dazzling.

But Old Mrs. Cen didn’t show the slightest bit of softness.

It was because the money wouldn’t go away and the son wouldn’t die.

“Now wasn’t the time to be soft-hearted. After giving birth to such an unfilial son, he should be taught a good lesson. ”

“Mom!”Zhou Xiang walked in front of old Mrs. Cen. “Stop hitting me!”

“Hearing Zhou Xiang’s voice, Cen Haifeng’s eyes were full of guilt. ”

“”Xiang Xiang, get out of my way!”Old Mrs. Cen scolded. ”

“Zhou Xiang looked at Old Mrs. Cen. “Mom, I beg you.” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen had some real skills. If he continued to hit him, even if Cen Haifeng didn’t die, he would lose a layer of skin. ”

“Although she didn’t have any feelings for Cen Haifeng, she couldn’t just watch him be beaten to death. ”

“Looking at Zhou Xiang, old Mrs. Cen Sighed, threw away the crutch in her hand, and continued, “Unfilial son, do you accept this beating wholeheartedly?” ”

“”Wholeheartedly.”Cen Haifeng raised his head and looked at Old Mrs. Cen, “Mom, I have let you down, and I have let Xiang Xiang and the children down. Whether it’s for the son, husband, or father, I have not fulfilled my responsibilities.” ”

“Twenty years had passed, and old Mrs. Cen’s hair was full of color. Even Zhou Xiang’s temples had some white hair. ”

The children had grown up.

“Looking at everything in front of him, Cen Haifeng felt even more guilty. ”

Sorry.

He had let them down.

“”Get up.”Old Mrs. Cen continued, “If Xiangxiang hadn’t pleaded for you today, I would have beaten you to death, you unfilial son!” ”

“Cen Haifeng stood up from the ground. “Mom, Xiangxiang, I’ll take you home first.” ”

“Where do you think we should go?”Old Mrs. Cen looked at Cen Haifeng in disbelief.

“”Home,”Cen Haifeng said. ”

“”That’s your home. What does it have to do with us?”Old Mrs. Cen said, “The s galaxy is such a high-level place. We can’t reach it.” ”

“Cen Haifeng immediately changed his words. “Mom, I’ll take you back to rest first.” ”

Old Mrs. Cen held Zhou Xiang’s wrist and followed his footsteps.

The group of people walked toward the headquarters in a grand manner.

“Although man Xing did not go to the scene, she saw the whole process at home. ”

“At this moment, she suddenly saw a familiar figure on the screen. ”

“Stop!”

The assistant pressed the pause button.

Man Xing looked at a silhouette in the crowd and narrowed his eyes. “Who is this person?”

“”This should be the girlfriend that young master Dongli brought over from Earth,”the assistant replied. ”

Young Master Dongli’s girlfriend?

Why did she find this person so familiar?

Even though it was just a silhouette.

“”Check her information,”man Xing said. ”

“Having worked beside man Xing for so many years, the assistant had a thorough understanding of man Xing’s personality. He then said, “Miss, I’ve already checked. This Earthling’s name is ye Zhuo.” ”

“”What did you say her name was?”At this moment, man Xing thought he was hearing things. ”

“Ye Zhuo.”
