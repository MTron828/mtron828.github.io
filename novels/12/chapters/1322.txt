Chapter 1323: 275: What a piece of trash! Zheng Wanyin’s face was swollen! 7

Translator: 549690339

Ye Zao!

Zheng Wanyin suspected that ye Zao had swapped her test paper with someone else’s?

“”Mom! As the main examiner, Zao Zao would definitely not do such a thing! Quickly get wanyin down, stop fooling around!”It was definitely not good for Zheng Wanyin to make such a big deal out of this. ”

Xie Wanqiu’s expression was very ugly. “Tell Yinyin to come down? To think that you would say that! You Are Yinyin’s biological aunt! Do you think that your niece is the kind of person who would create something out of Nothing?”

“”But burning is definitely not the kind of person who would tolerate cheating!”Zhou Xiang continued, “Mom, do you know the rules of the ABA? Once the examination papers are proven to be fine, Wanyin will not be able to join the ABA for the rest of her life!” ”

“Xie Wanqiu looked at Zhou xiang, “I know better than you what kind of strength Yin Yin is! The one who should regret is not Yin Yin, but someone who encourages evil!” ”

Zhou Xiang frowned tightly.

“Old Madam Cen walked out and said, “Those who are clear will be clear, and those who are unclean will be unclean. Xiang Xiang, ah! Some people like to be kind-hearted, no matter how you try to persuade them, it’s useless!” ”

“Zhou Xiang sighed. “Mom, it’s fine as long as you don’t regret it. When the time comes, if you regret it, no one will be able to help you.” ”

Xie wanqiu snorted coldly.

Zhou Xiang wanted to scare her?

Did she really think that she grew up being scared?

On the stage.

“The CEO continued, “Zheng Wanyin, are you sure you want to check the examination papers? Don’t you regret it?” ”

“”Yes, I don’t regret it.”Zheng Wanyin’s expression was firm. ”

“”Bai Xiaosu, what about you?”The CEO turned to look at Bai Xiaosu. ”

“Bai Xiaosu said, “I’m willing to cooperate with Zheng Wanyin.” ”

The CEO turned to look at his assistant. “Lisa.”

“Lisa nodded and walked to the bottom of the big screen. She clicked the mouse and said, “Bai Xiaosu, Zheng Wanyin, please take a look at the big screen.” ”

The two of them turned to look at the big screen.

“On the big screen, there were two enlarged test papers. ”

“Please confirm if these two test papers belong to the two of you?”

Zheng Wanyin and Bai Xiaosu nodded.

“Lisa clicked on the mouse and said, “Okay, then let’s take a look at the accuracy of the two of you.” ” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

The audience below the stage stared at the big screen without blinking.

“In the next second, one page of the test paper was flipped over. ”

Lisa’s voice sounded in the air again.

“”There are a total of 100 questions. Bai Xiaosu answered 3 questions wrongly, deducting 3 points.” ”

“”Zheng Wanyin, answer 30 questions wrongly, deducting 30 points.” ”

Zheng Wanyin’s face was pale and her entire body was trembling.

No.

Impossible.

This was not her examination paper.

How could she have done so badly.

Even though the handwriting was hers.

But it was impossible for her to do so well.

Someone must have imitated her handwriting and wrote a new test paper.

“Looking at the test paper on the screen and hearing Lisa’s voice, the people at the side sighed, “So we misunderstood Bai Xiaosu!” ”

“Bai Xiaosu is too amazing!”

“I knew it. The ABA is the fairest and fairest organization Alliance in the world. How could they pull the strings!”

“”Zheng Wanyin didn’t perform well herself, yet she still has to blame others! I support Bai Xiaosu this time!” ”

“Zheng Wanyin is really disappointing!”

“Even Liu Jingdou, who had been supporting Zheng Wanyin, was stunned. She had not expected this result. It turned out that Zheng Wanyin really did not do well in her exams. ”

She had even contacted so many people to support Zheng Wanyin Cheng and seek justice.

“Feeling everyone’s strange gazes, Zheng Wanyin tried her best to calm herself down and looked up at the CEO, “I request to see the assessment monitor. I didn’t write the assessment paper on the video! Someone is imitating my handwriting!” ”

“Under normal circumstances, during the assessment of the ABA, there would be a pinhole monitor that clearly recorded every examinee’s problem solving process. ”

But this was China.

China’s assessment should not have implemented this technology yet.

So.

The CEO definitely could not provide the monitor.

“As long as she could not return the monitor, it would prove her innocence. ”

Zheng Wanyin swallowed her throat.

“At this time, the CEO looked at Zheng Wanyin with disappointment in his eyes. ”

Yes.

Zheng Wanyin guessed correctly.

“During the assessment in China, there wasn’t a full surveillance system. ”

“Zheng Wanyin raised her head to look at the CEO. “CEO, please provide me with the surveillance.” ”

“The CEO narrowed his eyes. “Zheng Wanyin, stop fooling around!” ”

“”CEO, I Just Want to seek justice for myself!”Zheng Wanyin laughed self-deprecatingly. “Is it really the way of the powerful now? I don’t even have the right to seek justice for myself?” ”

Zheng Wanyin’s words once again ignited everyone’s emotions.

Because there was a message in her words.

On the other side.

The CEO felt guilty and did not dare to release the surveillance footage.

“Liu Jingjing stood out and said, “CEO, you’re not going to say that the surveillance footage is broken with such a lousy excuse, right?” ”

The CEO’s face was full of embarrassment.

“The ABA had announced that the entire assessment would be monitored. If he said that the China region did not implement it, no one would believe him. ”

What should they do now?

“Seeing this, Cen Shaoqing lowered his eyes and whispered to his assistant. ”

The assistant nodded and immediately ran out.

“In less than ten seconds, Lisa received the message and ran to the CEO’s side and whispered to him. ”

“Hearing that, the CEO’s dark eyes immediately lit up. “Go quickly.” ”

“Okay.”Lisa nodded.

“After a while, the CEO looked down at everyone and said, “My assistant Lisa has already gone to retrieve the surveillance footage. Please wait for a moment.” ”

“Hearing that, Zheng Wanyin frowned. ”

Retrieve the surveillance footage?

Where did the surveillance footage come from

“But even if there was really a surveillance footage, she was not afraid. ”

The handwriting could be imitated by someone.

But the surveillance footage could not!

“Zheng Wanyin raised her head to look at the CEO. “CEO, Lisa won’t Be Gone Forever, right?” ”

“The CEO did not answer Zheng Wanyin directly. Instead, he said, “Don’t worry, everyone. I will definitely give everyone an explanation. The ABA is the fairest and fairest alliance of International Organizations. There will definitely not be any acts of covering up for cheating.” ”

“Hearing this, everyone’s emotions calmed down slightly. ”

Ten minutes passed

Lisa was still not back.

“This time, everyone was not calm. ”

“It could not be like what Zheng Wanyin said. Lisa ran away and the CEO was stalling for time, right? ”

Fifteen minutes passed.

Lisa still did not make any movements.

“”CEO, when Will Lisa Be Back?” ”

“All of our time is precious!”

Zheng Wanyin’s lips curled up.

Come Back?

Lisa might not be able to come back.

Did the CEO want to let this matter rest?

No Way!

“Zheng Wanyin raised her head to look at the CEO and continued, “CEO, I don’t think there’s a need to wait for Lisa to come back! I hope you can keep your promise and deal with the Cheating Examiner!” ”

The CEO frowned slightly.

“At this moment, the sound of footsteps could be heard from the door. ”

Everyone turned around and saw that it was Lisa.

“”CEO, the monitor has been adjusted!” ”

The CEO finally smiled. “Hurry up and bring it over.”

Lisa jogged over and plugged in the USB.

“As soon as possible, two videos were played on the big screen. ”

One was Bai Xiaosu’s problem solving process.

The other was Zheng Wanyin’s.

“The monitor was playing quickly, but the question-solving process could be seen clearly. Looking at the monitor and then looking at the examination papers of the two people, one could see that there was nothing wrong with the two examination papers. ”

Zheng Wanyin looked at the big screen and felt her blood flow backwards.

Her back was covered with layers and layers of cold sweat.

No problem...

Really no problem.

What the hell was going on?

“”D * MN! This Zheng Wanyin really knows how to stir up trouble. She was clearly the one who wrote the test paper! She was still pretending to be innocent. Fortunately, there were surveillance cameras. Otherwise, it would really be hard to explain!” ”

“It’s such a pity to call her Zheng Wanyin. I think she should be called Zheng Lianhua!”
