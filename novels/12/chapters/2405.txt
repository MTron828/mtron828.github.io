“”Hurry up and go,”Mario said. ”

“About ten minutes later, Kading arrived. ”

“Are the two of you looking for me for something?”Kading asked.

Kading was currently very busy.

“He was busy finding the fatal weakness of the strange beast, and was also looking for the reason why the Strange Beast had escaped. ”

“With his back facing kading, Mario looked at the perpetual motion machine that was spinning. He then asked, “Do you know what that is?” ”

“Hearing this, Keating turned his head back and his eyes narrowed. ”

This is...

Perpetual Motion Machine?

It was hard to imagine that he would be able to see a perpetual motion machine in the L Continent Laboratory in his lifetime.

Keating’s eyes were filled with disbelief. He even suspected that he was dreaming.

“This... this...”Keating turned his head to look at Mario. “This is a perpetual motion machine?”

“Mario didn’t expect kading to be able to see through him with a single glance. The corners of his mouth curled up slightly. “That’s right, this is a perpetual motion machine.” ”

It was really a perpetual motion machine.

This was too inconceivable!

Could it be related to the exotic beasts?

“Thinking of this, kading narrowed his eyes. ”

“If that was really the case, then things wouldn’t be as simple as they seemed. ”

“However, when the energy of the exotic beasts was so powerful that even their strength was unable to contend against them, it would be a calamity for mankind! ”

“Recalling the defensive line that many countries had established near the L continent, the worry in Kading’s eyes grew even more intense. ”

Kading turned to look at Mario. “Is this the perpetual motion machine for the transformation of Exotic Beasts?”

“”That’s right,”Mario continued, “Kading, didn’t you support YC in the past to destroy it? “But now, not only did the exotic beasts not bring about any disaster, they even brought us the perpetual motion machine. Tell me, are you really a spy sent by China? ! “What exactly is the conspiracy behind your support for YC to destroy the exotic beasts?” ”

There was only one thing on Mario’s mind at the moment.

That was to drive kading out of the base.

A person like Kading simply did not have the qualifications to continue staying in the L continent base.

“”I’ve devoted my entire life to the base. You know very well whether I’m a spy or not.”Hearing that Mario suspected that he was a spy, Kading was extremely furious, he continued, “Mario, don’t be happy too early! If the exotic beasts were really controllable, there wouldn’t be such a thing as suddenly disappearing and suddenly returning! Don’t you feel that everything is extremely strange?” ”

Extremely Strange.

Kading also had a very strange premonition. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

The exotic beasts would soon break free from everyone’s control!

“Therefore, he had to nip everything in the bud when he could control it. ”

“Thinking of this, kading calmed down a little, he continued, “Mario, think carefully. If it was so easy to get the perpetual motion machine, would YC have destroyed the exotic beast while it was still a single cell? The sudden disappearance of the exotic beast yesterday was a warning!” ”

“At this point, Keating paused for a moment before continuing, “The most important thing for us now is to immediately clear up the tracks of the Beast Yesterday! What did it do during the period of its disappearance?” ”

Only by thoroughly investigating everything would we be able to know the true purpose of the Beast!

“Hearing Keating’s words, Mario immediately laughed out loud. “Keating, come and decide! Things have already come to this point, yet you’re still so obstinate! I think you’re a spy sent by China!” ”

“Even though the perpetual motion machine was out, Kading was still deceiving himself. ”

Did he really think that everyone else was as brainless as him?

“Kading continued, “Mario, there’s not much time left for us now! Do you know that the exit to the defense system has already been closed!” ”

“If the people of L continent wanted to leave now, it would be even more difficult than ascending to the heavens ”

Mario couldn’t be bothered with kading as he clapped his hands.

Pa Pa —

“Very quickly, two guards appeared in the laboratory. ”

“Mario continued, “Bring this base traitor down and lock him up.” ”

The two guards immediately controlled kading from both sides.

Kading looked at Mario in disbelief. “Are you crazy? What are you trying to do? I’m not a Spy!”

Mario turned around with a mocking look on his face. “Do spies have the word ‘spy’engraved on their faces?”

Of course not!

Mario had already tolerated kading for a very long time.

“However, there had never been a suitable reason to arrest kading. ”

“After all, Kading was an old man from the base. ”

“If they really locked kading up, the others would inevitably be unconvinced. ”

But it was different now.

He had used exotic beasts to create a perpetual motion machine!

What was a perpetual motion machine?

A perpetual motion machine was an invention that could cause a sensation all over the world.

“At present, other than China, there was no other country that could create a perpetual motion machine. ”
