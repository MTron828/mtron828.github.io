Others would definitely turn a blind eye to it.

Not everyone was like autumn flute.

And not everyone had such a good heart like autumn flute.

Ye Zhuo was a good example.

“Back then, she was clearly about to reunite with her parents’family, but it was ye Zhuo who forcefully broke them up. ”

So the way ye Zhuo became now was completely retribution!

It was all retribution!

“”Young miss,”ye Lan looked at Qiu Di. “No matter what, I have to thank you properly.” ”

“Qiu Di smiled gently. “Actually, there’s really no need. I didn’t help much either. Skynet was the one checking. Oh right, you’re going back to Manxing Kingdom soon. Have you thought about who will take over the base in the future?” ”

“Hearing this, Ye Lan was stunned. ”

She really hadn’t thought about this.

“Before this, she didn’t know her background, nor did she know that she was the princess of Manxing Kingdom. So, she didn’t think about leaving the base. ” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“After a moment, ye Lan turned to look at Qiu Di. “Young miss, who do you think is suitable to take over?” ”

“In any case, she would be the princess of Manxing Kingdom in the future. who was the manager of the base had nothing to do with her. ”

She might as well hand this matter over to Qiu Di.

“At the same time, she would return a favor to Qiu Di. ”

Qiu di frowned slightly. “You are the person in charge of the base. You should be in charge of this matter.”

“”No, no, no.”Ye Lan continued, “Miss, in my opinion, no one is more suitable than you to select the next manager.” ”

“”I am an outsider after all.”Qiu di continued, “The base was founded by you and Miss Ye. If it were me, it would be a little unfair.” ”

“Actually, Qiu Di had done so much for the Ye family’s base’s management rights. ”

“Otherwise, even if ye Lan changed the ye family’s base into Qiu Di’s base, what could she do? ”

Only by holding real power in her hands could people feel at ease.

“If Qiu Di did not lie to ye Lan that she was the Manxing Kingdom’s princess, would she so readily hand over all the management rights of the base to her? Damn ”

It was simply impossible!

“At first, Qiu Di was still worried that ye Lan would suspect that she was lying. ”

“Who would have thought that ye Lan, this idiot, would not have thought of this at all! ”

“Her heart was as high as the sky, and her life was as thin as paper. ”

“Ye Lan smiled and said, “Who said that you are an outsider! If it were not for you stopping me, the Ye family base would already be the Qiu Family Base Now! Tomorrow, Tomorrow I will hand over all the management rights and seals of the base to you. Who is the next manager, it is also up to you to decide!” ”

Tomorrow!

It seemed that she was getting closer and closer to her goal.

The corners of Qiu Di’s lips curled up without leaving a trace.

“”Since you trust me so much, then I will respectfully comply.”Qiu di smiled and said, “Sister Ye Lan, I will still say the same thing. After you arrive in Manxing Country, don’t forget about me as your elder sister.” ”

“Ye Lan smiled and said, “Don’t worry, I will forget about you no matter who I forget.” ”

“Qiu Di patted ye Lan’s hand. “Sister Ye Lan...”at this point, she seemed to have thought of something and immediately changed her words. “AH no, I should call you full moon sister from now on.” ”

Full Moon was the surname of the Manxing Kingdom.

Full Moon was the name of the first princess.

“Hearing this, Ye Lan’s face was full of smiles. ”

Full Moon.

Her name was full moon.

“”Eldest miss, you should call me by my current name.”Ye LAN continued, “My parents haven’t come over yet, so I don’t want to attract attention for the time being.” ”

Full Moon was too loud a name.

“If her enemies in Manxing Kingdom knew that she was the lost princess, they would definitely send people to assassinate her. ”

“Okay.”Qiu Di nodded.

“Ye Lan looked at Qiu di and said, “Young miss, then I’ll see you tomorrow. I’ll go back first.” ”

“Okay.”Qiu Di sent Ye Lan out.

“Ye Lan smiled and turned around. “Young miss, there’s no need to send me off. I can leave by myself.” ”

“Qiu di said, “Sister Ye Lan, you’re the Manxing Kingdom’s princess. It’s my honor to be able to send you out.” ”

“Perhaps it was because she had suffered too much when she was young, ye Lan really liked the title of Princess of Manxing Kingdom. ”

“”Eldest miss, please don’t make fun of me.”Ye Lan said somewhat embarrassedly, “The reason why I was able to find my biological parents and restore my identity is all thanks to you. If it wasn’t for you, I would still be kept in the dark!” ”

“”You should also thank yourself.”Qiu di continued, “As a person, it is still very important to judge the situation.” ”

“Yes.”Ye Lan nodded.

She was very glad that she had made the choice in the beginning.

“Don’t send me off. Go back quickly.”
