Translator: 549690339

A card!

A card could be shot straight into the wall.

And it was three points into the wood!

Who among ordinary people had such strength?

Yala looked at the card with his eyes wide open. His eyes were filled with disbelief.

Who?

Who was the person who threw the card?

“The next second, footsteps sounded in the air. ”

Yala looked up.

A slender figure walked over. She was wearing a black windbreaker and a pair of black Martin boots.

She had a black hat on her head and the wide brim of the hat covered her eyes.

“Looking up, she could only see a delicate jaw and dark red lips. ”

It was cool.

It was also a little cold.

This scene suddenly reminded him of a movie.

It was seamless.

“However, she felt colder and more real than in the movie. She could make people intuitively feel a sense of fear. ”

“When he watched the movie, he only felt that the plot of the movie was too exaggerated. ”

“In this world, there was no real kung fu. ”

Only now did he know.

The movie originated from life.

“Who are you?”Arle asked at this moment.

Carl’s eyes lit up when he saw who it was.

An!

It was An!

Carl did not expect ye Zao to appear at this moment.

“Just a moment ago, he thought that he would definitely die today. ” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Seeing Carl like this, Arle narrowed his eyes and looked at the person who came. “You are An!” ”

“”Yes,”ye Zaoqian said. ”

Yes!

Alar did not expect ye Zao to admit it so easily!

How did she come in alone?

Could it be that she had a mole in Las Vegas?

“An!”Carl called out excitedly.

Ye Zao nodded at him.

“Carl immediately walked towards ye Zao. subconsciously, he wanted to stand behind ye Zao. ”

Only by standing behind ye Zao would Carl Feel Safe.

“Stop!”Yaler put his hand on Carl’s shoulder.

“At the same time, Yaler’s men also quickly reached for the gun at their waist and aimed at Carl. ”

Carl stopped in his tracks. His heart was stuck in his throat.

“”The person you are looking for is me. Why do you have to make things difficult for Carl? Let him go. If there is anything, just come at me,”ye Zao said faintly. ”

“Are you really An?”Yaler asked.

“”I am.”Although ye Zao’s voice was faint, it was filled with a powerful aura. ”

“Alar raised his head and looked at ye Zao. “If you want me to let Carl Go, I can do it. I have one condition.” ”

“”Speak,”ye Zao said concisely. ”

“Alar continued, “Whose person are you? I want you to hand over your secret manual!”Ye Zao was able to win against Hibbert because of her secret manual, it was all because of her secret manual. She had cheated secretly. Yala had never seen any cheater who could escape from the cameras. ”

“Yala was the minister of La Nido Casino. If he mastered this secret manual, he would be invincible in the world! ”

“”No sect, no sect.” ”

“No sect, no sect? ”

How could ye Zao let Hibbert lose so miserably?

The corner of Yala’s lips curled up.

How could it be!

“It seems that you don’t want to save Carl anymore.”Yala’s eyes turned cold.

“Since you don’t believe me...”ye Zao said as he took out two cards from his pocket. “Then there’s nothing I can do.”

He finished his last sentence.

Shua!

She threw the cards in her hand out.

“Yala was stunned. The shadows of the cards were reflected in his eyes. Just when the cards were about to fly to his head, he quickly pushed Carl forward. ”

Looking at the biting cold cards.

Carl was so scared that he closed his eyes.

Carl thought that he would die under Yaler’s gun. He did not expect that he would die under a card.

“The next second, a hand grabbed Carl’s shoulder. Then, he was pulled out by a force. ”

“Are you okay?”A cold voice sounded in his ear.

Carl quickly opened his eyes. He saw that he had been pulled back to safety by Ye Zhuo.

“At this moment, Alar chased after him. ”

“Alar was born as a gangster. The previous boxing champion was his teacher. In addition, he had also learned combat and Sanda. He had trained all his muscles and was able to fight 10 people at once. ”

“Among ordinary people, very few people could be his opponent. ”

Unfortunately.

The person standing in front of him today was ye Zao.

“Ye Zao was not afraid, but Carl was so scared that his legs were shaking. ”

“He was from C Nation, so he naturally knew how powerful Carl was. ”

“Although ye Zao was also very good at throwing cards, that was only the skill of his fingers. ”

But yaler had real strength and muscles.

“If they fought in close combat, Ye Zao would definitely be at a disadvantage. ”

“After all, Yaler’s figure was comparable to three ye Zao! ”

“”An, what should we do?”Carl was about to cry. ”
