Chapter 1295: 272: she was completely stunned. Was That Ye Zhuo?

Translator: 549690339

What did the old cucumber paint green mean?

Pretentious!

“In Old Lady Cen’s view, this Xie Wanqiu was just pretending. ”

“Back then, if it wasn’t for the fact that Zhou Xiang was a good child and virtuous, Old Lady Cen would never have married such a person. ”

“Xie wanqiu also couldn’t stand Old Lady Cen. However, the Cen family was powerful and influential. Even if she couldn’t stand Old Lady Cen, she couldn’t show it. Not only could she not show it, but she had to use her cold face to warm up her butt. Just like now.., “Elder sister, it has been so many years since we last met, and you still like to joke around!” ”

“If it were not for Zheng Wanyin, she would not have come to see Bai Tang’s expression. ”

She was an unwavering presence in the Zhou family.

Old Lady Cen Glanced at Xie Wanqiu. “Am I joking? Don’t you know?”

“Xie wanqiu maintained her smiling face and continued, “Elder sister, didn’t I hear from Xiang Xiang that you went on a trip? Why didn’t you go on a trip for a while?” ”

“This damn old woman, why did she have to come back at this time. ”

Was she deliberately going against her?

“”I’ve only been out for a few days.”Old Mrs. Cen walked to the side and sat down. “Someone is already planning to renovate my house. If I stay out for a while longer, I’m afraid that the entire Cen family will have to change their name, right?” ”

“Xie wanqiu smiled apologetically. “Elder sister, I was just saying it casually. Look, you really took it to heart!” ”

This sentence was implying that old Mrs. Cen was stingy and calculative.

“She was, after all, the in-laws of the Cen family, Zhou Xiang’s mother. If she were to give her daughter some advice, would old Mrs. Cen really be so calculative? ”

“Old Mrs. Cen said, “For someone like you, it’s a pity that you don’t publish a book!” ”

“Xie wanqiu also felt that she was full of talent, but unfortunately, she did not encounter any bole. However, she still said humbly, “Elder sister, how can someone like me publish a book? You’re flattering me too much!” ”

“”Of course I can publish a book!”Old Mrs. Cen continued, “If you publish a book, ‘how old White Lotus was refined’, the sales will definitely be very good!” ”

“Xie wanqiu finally understood the hidden meaning behind old Mrs. Cen’s words, and her expression changed. ”

Old Mrs. Cen looked at Zhou Xiang. “Xiang Xiang!”

“Mom.”Zhou Xiang walked to Old Mrs. Cen’s side.

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “You are now a member of the CEN family. As a member of the CEN family, you should straighten your back a little. Don’t let any Tom, Dick, or Harry Step on your head!” ”

“Tom, Dick, or Harry? ”

Bai Tang was alluding to her?

Xie wanqiu narrowed her eyes.

“Of course, Zhou Xiang knew what Old Lady Cen meant, but Xie Wanqiu was still here, so she was in a dilemma and couldn’t answer Old Lady Cen’s words ”

She didn’t know when Xie Wanqiu would be able to go back!

“Old Lady Cen looked at Zhou Xiang, somewhat regretful that she didn’t live up to her expectations. ” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“As her daughter-in-law, she was good at everything. ”

But her personality was too soft.

She didn’t have much of a temper.

“Fortunately, her children didn’t follow her. ”

“Otherwise, they would have been bullied to death by Xie wanqiu, the old woman. ”

“In fact, old Mrs. Cen had taken a liking to Zhou Xiang. ”

To marry a good wife.

She was too lazy to deal with the fighting between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law.

“She made the family not like family, mother-in-law and daughter-in-law not like mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. ”

“Xie wanqiu looked at Zhou Xiang, her eyes full of resentment. ”

This daughter of hers was indeed a good biological daughter.

“If she were Zhou Xiang’s biological mother today, would Zhou Xiang still be bullied by this old woman from the Cen Family? ”

A cat and a dog.

“The Cen family’s old woman had already scolded her like this, but Zhou Xiang was still indifferent, as if she did not hear it. ”

Stepmother?

“No matter how good her stepmother was to her, she would not treat her stepmother as a human! ”

“Xie wanqiu narrowed her eyes and continued, “Elder sister, look at what you’re saying. Although our Xiangxiang is a kind person, she’s not someone who can be bullied by just anyone!” ”

“That might not be the case.”

“Seeing that the atmosphere between the two of them was getting more and more awkward, Zhou Xiang smiled and said to old madam CEN, “Mom, you just got home. You must be tired! Let me help you back to your room to rest!” ”

“After saying that, Zhou Xiang looked at Xie wanqiu and said, “Mom, you should go back to your room to rest as soon as possible.” ”

“Okay.”Xie wanqiu nodded and walked out of the door.

Look.

The difference between being biological and not biological was revealed again.

“Zhou Xiang was an ungrateful and ungrateful wretch. She raised Zhou Xiang from a teenager to her twenties in vain. After raising her for so many years, in the end, Zhou Xiang treated her worse than a mother-in-law. Whenever Zhou Xiang put her in his eyes, she would not have helped Old Lady Cen back to her room to rest and left her to the side! ”
