Chapter 747: 167: Sever the mother-child relationship and the assessment begins! 6

Translator: 549690339

And she was so determined!

Just the thought of Lin Qingxuan severing the mother-child relationship with her for Xia Xiaoman made old Madam Lin extremely uncomfortable.

She felt like she couldn’t breathe.

“She was already so old. If this news were to spread, how would she be able to live? ”

“Auntie Wang brought over a bowl of Chinese medicine. “Old Madam, it’s time to drink the medicine.” ”

Old Madam Lin turned her head. “I’m not drinking it! What’s the point of drinking the medicine now?”

“Auntie Wang Sighed, “Old Madam, no matter who you go against, don’t go against your own body. You have to at least drink some of this medicine. Don’t forget, you still have to participate in Miss Xianxian’s assessment! If you don’t drink the medicine, how are you going to take part in Miss Xianxian’s assessment?” ”

“Hearing this, Old Lady Lin’s expression changed and she sat up from the bed. ”

“Right now, other than Feng Xianxian, no one understood her and no one was filial to her. ”

She must not disappoint Feng Xianxian.

She wanted to see Feng Xianxian take first place with her own eyes!

“With this thought, Old Lady Lin’s expression softened a little. She took the Chinese medicine that Auntie Wang handed over and began to drink the medicine. ”

It was already the second day when ye Zhuo found out that Lin Qingxuan had broken off relations with Old Madam Lin.

“Actually, she was not surprised at all that Lin Qingxuan and old madam Lin had come to this point. ”

“According to Old Madam Lin’s methods, how many people would be able to withstand it? ”

“Lin Jincheng looked at Ye Zhuo. “Zhuozhuo, your fourth uncle and fourth aunt are going on a trip around the world. Why Don’t you go and talk to Lizi and have her stay with us for the time being?” ”

“Sure.”Ye Zao smiled and nodded.

“In the afternoon, Ye Zao went to find an Lizi. ”

“An Lizi was naturally very happy to be able to stay with ye Zao. However, apart from being happy, she was also a little worried. “Then, will your grandmother agree?”An Lizi did not forget that the Lin family still had a troublesome Old Lady Lin. ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “It doesn’t matter. She doesn’t live in the same courtyard as us. We don’t interfere in each other’s business.”Although they lived in the same manor as Old Lady Lin, because the Lin family manor was relatively large, in terms of life.., the family of four hardly interacted with Mrs Lin. ”

“So, on the same day Anlizi moved to the Lin family. ”

Lin Jincheng in leaf burning bedroom next door to Anlizi arranged a bedroom.

“”Thank you, Uncle Lin, thank you, Aunty,”said anlize ”

“Ye Shu said with a smile: “This child, now we are a family, also called Uncle Aunt?” ”

“An Lizi immediately changed her words. “Thank you, fifth uncle. Thank you, fifth aunt.” ”

“We’re all family. You’re welcome.”

“In order to celebrate an Lizi moving into the Lin family, Lin Jincheng personally cooked dinner that night. ”

“When Old Lady Lin heard that an Lizi was staying in the Lin family manor, she was furious again! ”

She called Lin Jincheng over overnight and asked him to chase an Lizi away.

“Lin Jincheng looked at old madam Lin and said, “Mom, if you don’t want fourth brother and I to make the same choice, then don’t get involved in this matter.” ”

Old Madam Lin choked in her chest and almost didn’t recover.

It was the opposite.

It was all the opposite.

These brothers were getting more and more outrageous!

Time passed very quickly.

“Seeing that the day of the literary world assessment was getting closer and closer, Feng Xianxian became more and more nervous. ”

“Although there were only thirty people participating in this assessment, other than ye Zhuo, everyone else had real talent. ”

“Other than Feng Xianxian, Liu Caiyi was also a little worried. ”

“After all, she had placed her bet on Feng Xianxian. ”

“In order to let Feng Xianxian smoothly get first place, Liu Caiyi specially invited the Chief Examiner to dinner tonight. “Mr. Teng, let me toast you.” ”

“”Vice-president Liu, you’re too polite.” ”

“Liu Caiyi’s talent was well-known in the Chinese Arts Association. Although she was only a vice-president now, she would definitely be able to become the president in time, or even a higher position. ”

“Liu Caiyi drank a mouthful of wine and continued, “I heard that Master Yu’s new last disciple, Miss Ye, will also participate in the assessment competition. I wonder if that’s true?” ”

“It’s like this.”Teng Xin nodded.

“Liu caiyi smiled and said, “I heard that Miss Ye is a talented person. She will definitely be able to get first place in this assessment.” ”

This was called flattery.

“After all, the higher one stood, the worse one would fall. ”

“When Master Yu’s last disciple, Ye Zhuo, was mentioned, Teng Xin’s gaze was a little complicated. ”

He didn’t even understand why master Yu would take in a person whom he had never heard of in the literary world as his last disciple.

Who Was Master Yu?

He was the great master of the literary world. The disciple he took in would one day become the great master of the literary world.

But could ye Zhuo really do it?

Teng Xin had heard a lot about ye Zhuo over the past few days.

It was said that ye Zhuo became master Yu’s last disciple because he used a backdoor.

“After all, master Yu and Old Master Lin were close friends. ”

“Moreover, old master Lin still owed Master Yu a favor. Therefore, master Yu only accepted ye Zao because he wanted to repay the favor. ”

Wasn’t he joking about the future of the literary world?

“Seeing that Teng Xin didn’t speak for a long time, Liu Caiyi asked, “Mr. Teng, What’s Wrong? Are you not feeling well?” ”

“It wasn’t that Teng Xin wasn’t feeling well, but he was unable to answer Liu Caiyi’s question. ”

There was no way for him to reply?

It would have been fine if ye Zhuo hadn’t entered through the back door.

“However, Ye Zhuo had entered through the back door. ”

Liu Caiyi said that ye Zhuo would be able to get first place?

Wasn’t this a fantasy?

“Teng Xin could only smile and say, “Since Miss Ye is Master Yu’s new last disciple, then her aptitude shouldn’t be too bad.”Master Yu was the person Teng Xin worshipped the most. Right now, he only hoped that ye Zhuo wouldn’t lose too miserably, he would embarrass master Yu. ”

“Seeing Teng Xin’s reaction, Liu Caiyi had a plan in her heart. ”

It seemed that these people in the literary world all knew about ye Zhuo’s background.

“Two hours later, Liu Caiyi said goodbye to Teng Xin and went to Feng Xianxian’s residence. ”

“At this time, Feng Xianxian was very happy to see Liu Caiyi. “Sister Caiyi, please come in.” ”

“Liu Caiyi nodded. “There are three more days until the assessment competition. Xianxian, how are your preparations going? Have you read the information I gave you last time?” ”

“”Sister Caiyi, don’t worry. I’ve memorized all the content.” ”

“”That’s good.”Liu Caiyi continued, “I just met the head examiner of this assessment today. He told me that at least half of the answers to the assessment questions are on the information I gave you.” ” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Really?”Feng Xianxian was overjoyed.

“She was originally worried that she wouldn’t be able to pass the other examinees, but now it seemed that she didn’t have to worry at all. ”
