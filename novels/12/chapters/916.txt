“Xiao Mei took a photo with her phone and sent it to her moments. Then, she started to drink coffee.”

Coffee was too bitter.

People without taste wouldn’t be able to drink it.

Xiao Mei frowned slightly. The taste of the rich was too strange. They actually liked to drink this kind of thing.

“XI weiyue continued, “Xiao Mei, do you have something to say to me?””

Xiaomei then remembered the important matter. “It’s about Little Half Moon.”

Little Half Moon?

Xi Weiyue narrowed her eyes. “Continue.”

“Xiaomei continued, “Just now, there was a man who looked to be about thirty-five or thirty-six years old. He drove a Bentley. Initially, Aunt Lang did not want to see him, but he said that he knew about little half moon. Then, Aunt Lang brought him into the house.””

“And then?”Xi Weiyue asked anxiously.

“Xiao Mei smiled. “I know you’re very concerned about half a month, so I hid outside the door and listened. I heard the man say that he’s 50% sure that it’s half a month, and he asked Aunt Lang to promise him something.””

“What is it?”

“Xiao Mei frowned, then said, “He asked Aunt Lang to go back with them.””

Go Back?

“XI weiyue asked, “Did they say where they were going?””

“”They didn’t say.”Xiao Mei shook her head. “But Aunt Lang didn’t seem to be willing to go back with them. After some consideration, Aunt Lang said that as long as she could find half a month, she would do anything.””

Xi Weiyue felt a sense of crisis.

“If ye Langhua really found half a month, then what was she?”

“All these years, she had always treated ye Langhua as her biological mother.”

What about ye Langhua?

Ye Langhua was like an ingrate. He did not treat her as his biological daughter at all.

“After a while, Xi Weiyue smiled at Xiao Mei. She took out an envelope from her bag and handed it to Xiao Mei. “Xiao Mei, thank you for telling me this.””

“Xiao Mei politely pushed the envelope back. “Miss Weiyue, you’re too kind. I can’t accept this.””

“”Keep it. It’s just a small token.”Xi Weiyue picked up her bag. “Then, I’ll go back first.””

“”Okay, take care.””

“Watching Xi Weiyue’s back disappear outside the shop, Xiao Mei shouted, “Waiter, come here for a moment.””

“Hello.”The waiter immediately trotted over.

“Xiao Mei continued, “Help me pack all these. I haven’t drunk these two cups of coffee, so pack them too.””

“”It’s a total of 32 yuan,”the waiter answered.”

Xiao Mei was stunned. “Didn’t you already pay for it?”

“The waiter smiled and explained, “This 32 yuan is for packing.””

30 yuan was enough to buy pork!

This high-end coffee shop was really different. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Xiao Mei continued, “Pack it up.””

The children at home had never eaten such high-end desserts and coffee before.

“Okay.”

...

On the other side.

Xi Weiyue returned to the Xi family home.

Xi Muwen was not home.

“Yang Jiao was playing mahjong with a bunch of rich ladies downstairs. When she saw Xi Weiyue, she asked curiously, “Weiyue, why are you back now?””

“At this time, Yang Jiao was still in the mood to play mahjong!”

Xi Weiyue was inexplicably annoyed and did not say anything. “I’m back for some matters.”

“OH.”Yang Jiao did not ask further.

“The rich lady sitting on Yang Jiao’s left side looked up at Yang Jiao as she touched the tiles. She smiled and said, “Mrs. Mu, your Weiyue is getting more and more beautiful!””

“”That’s right.”Another rich lady added, “Not only is her weiyue beautiful, she’s also amazing. Look at how she manages the company! How many people in this circle can compare to her?””

The other two ladies immediately chimed in.

“Xi Weiyue’s talent was well-known in the circle. She had been smart since she was young. She skipped three grades in primary school, then one grade in high school. Now, Xi Weiyue was only in her twenties, but she already had a master’s degree, and she had already set up her own company.”

“Compared to those rich second-generation heirs, she was many times better!”

“Hearing everyone praising her daughter, Yang Jiao’s face naturally lit up. After all, Xi Weiyue had crawled out from her belly.”

“At this moment, Mrs. Wang, who had her hair permed, said, “Oh right, why hasn’t That Crazy Woman returned recently?””

Who was the crazy woman referring to?

“Of course, it was ye Langhua!”

“Back then, ye Langhua’s name shook the capital. She was the first love of many nobles, and also the love rival of many people!”

“Later on, Ye Langhua fell off the altar. Her hair turned white overnight, and her talent was no longer there. She even lost the ye family. She cried all day long and became a crazy woman that anyone could step on.”
