That’s right.

This old man was professor Feng’s old mother.

“Professor Feng was the only daughter of this old man. Now that Professor Feng had left for C country, she had no other relatives in this world. ”

Wasn’t this kind of person a lonely old man?

“Therefore, Aunt Wu, who was in charge of taking care of the old lady, did not put the old lady in her eyes. She brought the whole family to the villa and lived a rich life. ”

“Auntie Wu, who was in charge of taking care of the old lady, instead changed from a servant to the owner of the villa. ”

And the old lady changed from the owner to someone who lived under someone else’s roof!

“”Mom, what if her daughter suddenly comes back?” ”

“Auntie Wu turned around with a smile. “Oh my silly daughter! Haven’t You Seen the news? That Feng Qi has already been expelled from China! Do you think China will still let her come back now?”In China.., there was no place for Feng Qi to stay. ”

How could she come back!

“The old lady did not have any relatives in Beijing, so Auntie Wu was not worried that Professor Feng would come back to cause trouble for her. She was even less worried that the old lady’s relatives would come back to support her! ”

“With that said, Auntie Wu’s daughter, Yang Ting, heaved a sigh of relief. She continued, “Really? Then she doesn’t have any relatives here?” ”

“”No,”Auntie Wu said. “She’s an only child herself and has given birth to an only child. Even if her family really does have any relatives, she’s already so old. How many of them can still live in this world?” ”

The old lady was already 89 this year. Her relatives were definitely around the same age as her.

The average age in China was 77. How many of them could live to 89?

Yang Ting nodded. “That’s good.”

Auntie Wu looked around and lowered her voice. “I heard that old lady has a treasure. We must think of a way to bring that treasure over.”

“What treasure?”Yang Ting asked curiously.

“Auntie Wu said, “I heard that it’s some kind of jade. It’s a national treasure of the Song Dynasty!” ”

Auntie Wu had worked for the Feng family for many years. She was quite familiar with the Feng family’s situation. She knew that Professor Feng did not bring the old lady’s Plain Jade with him when he went abroad this time.

“Really?”Yang Ting’s eyes lit up when she heard that it was a national treasure of the Song dynasty.

An item that was called a national treasure must be very expensive!

“”Of course it’s true.”Auntie Wu nodded. “Once we get our hands on that treasure, we won’t have to worry about food and clothing for the rest of Our Lives!” ”

“”Water, I want to drink water.”At this moment, the old lady who was lying on the rocking chair said in a hoarse voice. ”

“Can’t you pour the water yourself?”Auntie Wu stood up. “Your daughter doesn’t even want you anymore. Do you really think you are some old lady? And you want us to pour the water for you? Dream On!”

“Hearing this, the old lady glanced at Auntie Wu. After a moment, she slowly stood up from the rocking chair and staggered to the back room to pour the water. ”

“Auntie Wu looked at her back and continued, “Pour us a glass of water too.” ”

“”Mom, don’t make things difficult for the old lady. I’ll get you some water.”Yang Ting stood up from the chair. ”

“”Tingting, why are you so nice to her?”Auntie Wu said unhappily. ”

She was just an old woman who couldn’t do anything. There was no need to be too respectful to her.

“Yang Ting looked at the old lady’s back and her eyes were full of calculating light, then, she said, “Mom, don’t you want her heirloom? “She doesn’t have an heir, so let’s be nice to her. Maybe she will leave those things to us in the future! “Besides, she is already so old. If anything happens to her, who will pay you in the future? “For a lonely old man like her who doesn’t have any immediate relatives, the estate and property will be owned by the state in the future! “But with a will, it’s different.” ”

“As long as there was a will, all these things would belong to their family in the future. ”

Yang Ting’s words could be said to have woken up the person in the dream!

“”Right, right, right. Tingting, you’re right! Tell Me, why didn’t mom think of this! As expected, everyone who studies is better!”For people like them who didn’t have any education.., they could only see the benefits in front of them and understand this logic. Auntie Wu immediately ran into the house and said with a smile, “Old Madam, Old Madam! I’ll get you some water. Oh right, what do you want to eat for lunch? I’ll go buy it for you.” ”

Auntie Wu’s change was too big. The old lady looked at her and was slightly stunned.

“Auntie Wu took the cup from the old lady and said, “Old Lady, didn’t you say that you wanted to eat lobster porridge? How about I cook lobster porridge for You for lunch?” ”

“After a moment, the old lady reacted and nodded. “Okay.” ”
