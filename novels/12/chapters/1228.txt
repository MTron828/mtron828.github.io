Which noble family would be willing to marry a person with mental problems?

“Liu Sanniang said, “Don’t tell me! I really have one here. I just don’t know if you’re satisfied.” ”

“Oh? Which family is it?”Father Zhao looked up at Liu Sanniang.

“”You know this person too.”Liu Sanniang continued, “It’s young master Qian of the Qian Financial Group.” ”

Qian Financial Group?

Father Zhao narrowed his eyes.

The Qian Financial Group was also a large financial group.

The current Zhao Xueyin was really not on the same level as the Qian Financial Group.

“Unfortunately, the Qian Financial Group’s eldest son was an honest man. ”

He was not very good-for-nothing!

How honest was this honest man?

“He was so honest that when others lied to him that shit was cake, he would eat it without hesitation. ”

“Qian Dafu, the founder of the Qian Financial Group, once wanted to give up on this son and give birth to a new one. ”

“He thought that way, but in fact, Qian Dafu did the same. ”

“However, after giving birth to three children and an illegitimate child, all of them died before the age of three! ”

“After losing his beloved son four times in a row, Qian Dafu finally gave up on continuing to give birth and focused on raising his only son, Qian Xiaochuan. ”

“Although Qian Xiaochuan was a little honest, he was a good-for-nothing. ”

“It was better than nothing. At the very least, he could still carry on the family line. ”

“If it was in the past, Father Zhao would definitely chase Liu Sanniang away! ”

He actually dared to introduce his daughter to a fool.

“But now, it was different from the past. ”

“After a night of ferment, everyone knew that Zhao Xueyin was mentally ill and mentally abnormal. ”

It was almost impossible for her to marry into a good family in the future.

The Qian family probably saw this and dared to send Liu Sanniang.

“Otherwise, why would the Qian family send people at this time when they usually didn’t send people? ”

“Father Zhao frowned slightly. He was a young lady, so he was naturally unhappy to be insulted like this. ”

“Seeing Father Zhao like this.., liu Sanniang smiled and said, “Old Mister Zhao, don’t think that young master Qian is honest. In fact, this honest man has the benefits of being honest. This honest man, once Miss Zhao marries over, who will be in charge of the Qian Family? Of course it will be Miss Zhao! An honest man will not be fooling around outside. In the future, it will be up to Miss Zhao to decide. If Miss Zhao asks him to go east, I can guarantee that he will not dare to go west.” ”

“Hearing this, Father Zhao narrowed his eyes. ” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Liu Sanniang was right about one thing.

“If Zhao Xueyin married into the Qian family, the person in charge of the Qian family in the future would be Zhao Xueyin. ”

“After all, Qian Xiaochuan was Qian Dafu’s only son. ”

The current Zhao family was already riddled with holes. It would be great if they could marry into the Qian family at this time.

“Although he had such thoughts in his heart, Father Zhao did not show it. He continued, “Although that’s what you said, Whoever’s daughter is the one who dotes on her. Mrs. Liu, if it were you, would you be willing to let your daughter marry into the Qian Family?” ”

“”Look at what you’re saying.”Liu Sanniang smiled at Father Zhao, “If I had a daughter, I would definitely be willing to let her marry into the Qian family! This marriage is hard to find even with lanterns! I just don’t know if the head of the Qian family would take a fancy to my daughter.” ”

“If she had a daughter, she really wouldn’t be willing to let her daughter marry Qian Xiaochuan. ”

Who would let their daughter marry a fool?

But who asked Zhao Xueyin to have a problem herself?

How could this crazy person be matched with a fool?

“After saying that, Liu Sanniang continued, “Old Mr. Zhao, master Qian said that as long as you agree to this marriage, he will immediately give 2% of the Qian Financial Group’s shares as a betrothal gift.” ”

2% ?

The market value of the Qian Financial Group was in the 12th digits.

Father Zhao narrowed his eyes.

It seemed that the Qian family had really invested a lot in order to marry a wife!

“In this way, this business deal was not a loss. ”

“Although Qian Xiaochuan was a little honest, he was not ugly. As long as he did not speak, no one would find out that there was a problem with his IQ. ”

“Putting aside his IQ, Qian Xiaochuan was very suitable for Father Zhao’s son-in-law. ”

“”Marriage is not a child’s play. I have to be responsible for my daughter!”Father Zhao picked up his cup and took a sip of tea. “Mrs. Liu, I have to think about this carefully.” ”

“”This kind of thing should indeed be considered carefully!”Liu Sanniang asked her assistant to take out a red wooden box, then, she said, “Oh right, Mr. Zhao, the head of the Qian family heard that you have an old cold leg disease. He specially asked someone to bring back a special medicine from Yunchuan District to treat the old cold leg rheumatism. You must try it.” ”
