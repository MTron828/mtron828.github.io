“Okay.”Kevin nodded. “I’ll go now. Please wait a moment.”

“After saying that, Kevin turned around and went to look for Wen Zhi. ”

Wen Zhi was still in the midst of his earlier excitement and was unable to extricate himself.

“After all, he would be a leader in the future. ”

The Wen family had finally stood up in his generation.

“It was a pity that his father was no longer alive. If his father was still alive, he would definitely be proud of him! ”

“”Mr. Wen.”At this moment, Kevin’s voice came from the air. ”

Wen Zhi’s thoughts were pulled back at this moment. “Mr. Kevin!”

“Kevin continued, “Professor Mi Jia Di wants to see you. Please come with me.” ”

“”Okay.”Wen Zhi nodded. He held back the excitement in his heart and continued, “Why is the Professor Looking for me?” ”

Kevin smiled. “You’ll know when you get there.”

Wen Zhi did not ask any more questions and followed Kevin’s footsteps.

They arrived at Mi Jia Di’s office.

“Wen Zhi was not nervous. After all, he was someone who could deceive even ye Zhuo. Thinking of this, Wen Zhi straightened his body and looked at Mi Jia Di. ”

It would have been fine if he was born this way.

“However, Wen Zhi was just pretending. He gave people the feeling that he was pretending. ”

“Kevin walked forward and smiled. “Dr. Mi Jiadi, this is Mr. Wen Zhi.” ”

“Wen Zhi immediately said, “Hello, Dr. Mi Jiadi. I’m Wen Zhi.” ”

“Mi Jiadi looked up at Wen Zhi. “Mr. Wen Zhi, I’ve always heard your name in front of Kevin. It’s my honor to finally meet you in person!” ”

“Hearing this, a sense of superiority ignited in Wen Zhi’s heart. Although he was a nobody in the Cen family’s base, he was someone that Mi Jiadi had personally received in C nation. ”

How could an ordinary person receive such treatment?

“Although he thought so in his heart, Wen Zhi did not show it. He smiled and said, “Professor, you’re flattering me too much. I’m merely contributing my own strength to C Nation’s scientific and Technological Community!” ”

“Mi Jiadi nodded in satisfaction and continued, “Mr. Wen Zhi, you did very well this time. Your future will definitely be bright.” ”

“”Thank you for your praise, Professor.” ”

“”However,”mi Jiadi changed the topic at this time and continued, “I still have one last mission that I need you to complete.” ”

One Last Mission?

“Hearing this, Wen Zhi subconsciously felt that this mission was not simple, but he still said, “Professor, please say it. I will definitely do my best and die.” ”

“Although he knew that Mi Jiadi’s mission might be very difficult, Wen Zhi was not afraid at all. ”

“After all, everything was already in his hands. ”

“Including Ye Zhuo, they were all under his control. ”

“”With Mr. Wen Zhi’s words, I am relieved.”Mi jiadi nodded and continued, “I hope you can go to Mars again until China holds a global press conference.” ”

Make another trip back?

“Wen Zhi frowned slightly and continued, “Do you have other tasks for me?” ”

“”Yes.”Mi JIADI continued, “Right now, only Mr. Wen Zhi can complete this task.” ”

“When he heard this, Wen Zhi was extremely excited. ” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

He felt that this was Mi Jiadi’s recognition of him.

“In the entire C country, he was the only one who could complete this task. One could imagine his position in C country. ”

“”Doctor, just tell me directly,”Wen Zhi said. ”

Mi Jiadi looked at Wen Zhi. “I have been dealing with YC for more than two years. I know that YC is not a simple person. I want you to help me monitor her and report her every move to me.”

There were two meanings in one sentence.

“Because Mi Jiadi not only wanted Wen Zhi to supervise ye Zhuo, but he also wanted to supervise Wen Zhi. ”

“Now, he had to make sure that Wen Zhi was not giving him a live version of a double agent. ”

Just supervising ye Zao?

“Wen Zhi thought that this mission would be very difficult, but he did not expect it to be so simple. He immediately smiled and said, “Professor, don’t worry. I will definitely complete this mission beautifully.” ”

“Okay.”Mi Jiadi nodded. “I believe in you.”

“After saying that, Mi Jia di turned to look at Kevin. “Kevin.” ”

“I’m here.”Kevin took a step forward.

“Mi Jia di continued, “At 6 pm, we will hold a celebration party for Mr. Wen Zhi.” ”

“Okay.”

“When he heard this, Wen Zhi was extremely excited. He quickly bowed to express his gratitude. “Thank you, Professor.” ”

“”You deserve all of this.”Mi Jia Di looked at Wen Zhi and smiled. “Mr. Wen Zhi, your future glory will definitely not stop here.” ”

“Wen Zhi then bowed. “Thank you, Professor.” ”
