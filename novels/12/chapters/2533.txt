Baylor nodded.

“Ye Zao put Baylor on the ground, a little worried. ”

“Baylor had just learned how to walk, and when he walked, he swayed. Ye Zao was a little worried and used his hand to support him. Baylor pushed away ye Zao’s hand and said in a childish voice, “I know nine! I’m Not Fat!” ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Okay, okay, our Baylor is not fat!” ”

Baylor looked at Cen Shaoqing and snorted.

“He was clearly a child, but he acted like an adult, making people not know whether to laugh or cry. ”

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “Leader, why is he called Baylor?” ”

“Ye Zao continued, “Didn’t you notice his hairstyle?” ”

Cen Shaoqing immediately looked down and indeed saw Baylor’s unusual hairstyle. His thin lips parted slightly. “He’s already bald at such a young age. He definitely won’t be able to find a girlfriend in the future.”

“Although Baylor did not know what a girlfriend meant, he could tell that it was definitely not something good. He looked at Cen Shaoqing and rolled his eyes. ”

Ye Zhuo could not help but laugh. “He rolled his eyes at you.”

“Cen Shaoqing did not say anything on the surface. In fact, when ye Zhuo was not paying attention, he immediately rolled his eyes at Baylor. ”

This scene was coincidentally captured by Ye Zhuo who was looking back.

Cen Shaoqing was stunned.

“Ye Zhuo laughed out loud. “Mr. Cen, you’re too childish!”He actually rolled his eyes at a child. ”

Cen Shaoqing could not defend himself.

Baylor laughed very proudly.

“At this moment, Ye Zhuo received a text message. ”

It was from Zhao Pingting.

Zhao pingting came over to look for her. She had a misunderstanding with someone on the way and went to the police station. She needed to go over.

Ye Zhuo looked at Cen Shaoqing. “I’m going out for a while. You take care of Baylor.”

“Where are you going?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“”Pingting had a misunderstanding with someone. She asked me to go over. Don’t worry, I’ll be back soon,”ye Zhuo replied. ”

“”Okay.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly and continued, “Call me almost anytime if there’s anything.” ”

“”Okay.”Ye Zao nodded slightly and squatted down to look at Baylor. He instructed, “Baylor, listen to your uncle. Aunt will be back soon.” ”

Baylor pursed his lips and was about to cry.

Ye Zao had a headache.

“”Watch me.”Cen Shaoqing gave ye Zao a look, then squatted down and whispered a few words into Baylor’s ear. ”

It was very magical!

“After listening to Cen Shaoqing, Baylor immediately stopped crying. He raised his head to look at Ye Zao with tears in his eyes. “Listen, listen to me!” ”

“Cen Shaoqing explained from the side, “Baylor means that he is a little man. You can rest assured that he won’t Cry!” ”

“Yes.”Baylor nodded in cooperation.

“Baylor is so obedient!”Ye Zao hugged Baylor’s face and kissed him on the cheek.

Cen Shaoqing:”...”he really wanted to give himself a tight slap. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Ye Zao turned around and left.

Baylor looked at her back reluctantly until she was nowhere to be seen.

“Although Cen Shaoqing was a little against Baylor, he would not bother with a child, let alone a child who had just turned one year old. ”

“Not long after, Ye Zao came with Zhao Pingting. ”

“Zhao Pingting looked at the guests in the hall and asked curiously, “Why don’t I see Lizi?” ”

“Logically speaking, an Lizi wouldn’t be absent at such an occasion. ”

“Ye Zhuo explained, “Lizi’s defense is today. She might arrive later.” ”

“Her defense is today?”Zhao Pingting asked.

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“No Wonder.”

“While the two were chatting, a small figure rushed towards them. ”

“Du du!”Baylor opened both of his arms and rushed towards them.

Ye Zao squatted down and also opened his arms to welcome him.

“Baylor.”

“Seeing such a loving scene, Zhao Pingting’s heart almost melted. She asked, “Zao, whose child is This?” ”

“Ye Zha smiled and said, “This belongs to my eighth cousin’s sister-in-law.” ”

“Zhao Pingting reached out and pinched Baylor’s face. “How cute! Little Guy, What’s Your Name?” ”

“”Fai, Brother Fai!”Baylor said. ”

“Brother Fai?”Zhao Pingting was stunned.

“Ye Zha smiled and said, “It’s a handsome guy.” ”

“Yes!”Baylor nodded.

This was what his father had taught him.

“If a pretty girl asked him his name, he should answer that she was a handsome guy. ”

Zhao pingting laughed even more anxiously.

“Ye Zhuo continued to ask, “Where’s your uncle?” ”

“Then!”Baylor pointed with his small hand.

Ye Zhuo looked in the direction Baylor was pointing and saw Cen Shaoqing.

“”Pingting, let’s go take a look,”ye Zhuo said. ”

“Okay.”Zhao Pingting followed ye Zhuo’s footsteps.
