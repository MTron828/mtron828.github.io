Translator: 549690339

“Song Chenyu’s acting skills were good and her looks were good. She was also known as a once-in-five-thousand-years beauty. She was the goddess in the hearts of many otakus. At the same time, she was also the goddess in Lu Qi’s heart.”

“”Yes.”Song Yiwan nodded and asked in return, “Do you like her very much?””

Lu Qi did not hide his love for Song Chenyu. “I liked her before she debuted.”

“Song yiwan smiled and said, “Actually, I liked her too, especially her role in ‘beauty’. I watched it three times!””

“‘beauty’was a xianxia movie, and song Chenyu played the female lead in it.”

“The female lead died in the end to save the world, and her role was very likable. Many of Song Chenyu’s fans liked her from ‘beauty’.”

“Upon hearing this, Lu Qi quickly nodded in agreement. “Yes, yes, yes! I also fell in love with her from “Beauty of the world.””

“After saying this, Lu Qi continued, “But didn’t the internet say that song Chenyu doesn’t like this kind of reality show?””

“Song Yiwan frowned. “I’m not too sure about that. Anyway, I saw her on the guest list. Maybe our show is different from other shows, so she came, right?””

Lu Qi felt that what song Yi Wan said made sense.

“At that moment, the program team came over to greet them, reminding them that filming was about to begin.”

The three of them immediately got into the mood and began to talk about what happened last season.

“Wei Xing Zhi was a very funny person. With just a few words, he made song Yi Wan and Lu Qi laugh out loud.”

“Not long after, there was a knock on the door of the small courtyard.”

Wei xingzhi walked over to open the door.

“Three young people were standing outside the door with their luggage. When they saw Wei Xingzhi, they immediately bowed politely. “Hello, teacher Wei. I’m Chang Yu.””

“”Teacher Wei, I’m Wang Xuancheng.””

The two of them had been very popular a few years ago and had not produced any new works recently. They had come to participate in this program to consolidate their popularity and also to promote the new drama.

“”Hello, teacher Wei. I’m Yin Wei.””

The female star Yin Wei was a newcomer who had just debuted.

“Before participating in this program, she had acted in a youth school drama and had become popular online. Currently, the traffic was plummeting.”

“Wei xingzhi smiled and said, “Come in quickly.””

The three of them followed Wei xingzhi into the small courtyard.

“When they saw a new guest come over, Lu Qi and song Yiwan immediately came out to welcome him.”

They had just gotten to know each other.

“Knock, Knock, Knock”

There was another knock on the door.

It must be song Chenyu.

“Lu Qi’s eyes lit up. He looked up at the crowd and said, “It must be my goddess. I’ll go open the door. Don’t fight with me!””

“As soon as he said that, he immediately rushed over to open the door.”

The person standing outside the door was none other than song Chenyu!

“Song Chenyu was wearing a white one-piece dress, a straw hat on his head, and light nude makeup on his face. He looked fresh and natural, and people couldn’t help but look at him again and again.”

“Although Lu Qi was also a well-known male star, he only became popular last year and had never worked with song Chenyu before. This was the first time he had seen song Chenyu in person.”

“Suddenly facing song Chenyu directly, Lu Qi’s heart beat a little faster.”

“Song Chenyu usually saw the most men, the men who admired her. Looking at Lu Qi, she knew that Lu Qi must be one of her admirers. Song Chenyu suppressed the sense of superiority in his heart and looked up at Lu Qi, “Hello, is this a small village house?””

“Lu Qi finally reacted and immediately extended her hand to song Chenyu. “Hello, teacher song, I’m Lu Qi.””

Song Chenyu debuted four years ago.

“She was good-looking, had good acting skills, and had won many gold awards. In comparison, Lu Qi was just a newbie, so it was normal for her to call song Chenyu teacher song.”

“Song Chenyu smiled and said, “Lu Qi, I’ve watched your television. We’re all the same age. You can just call me by my name.””

“After learning that song Chenyu had watched his television, Lu Qi felt a little embarrassed. He turned his head and shouted into the courtyard, “Teacher Wei, Yi Wan, Xuan Cheng, Chang Yu, Yin Wei, come out quickly. Teacher Song Is Here!””

The five of them immediately trotted over to welcome song Chenyu.

Song Chenyu followed the five of them into the courtyard.

Lu Qi immediately went to pour a glass of water for song Chenyu.

Song Chenyu took the water and took a sip. His gaze scanned the surroundings without leaving a trace. “Are there any other guests who haven’t come?”

“Lu Qi said, “There seems to be another internet celebrity who hasn’t come.””

“OH.”Song Chenyu nodded.

“”Internet Celebrity?”When he heard this, Wang Xuecheng’s expression was a little complicated. “Are there any internet celebrities coming to participate in our program?””

Lu Qi nodded. “Yes.”

“Although Wang Xuancheng did not say it explicitly, the expression on his face said it all.”

Internet celebrities and celebrities were not in the same world at all.

He did not know what the program team was doing!

Why did they even invite an internet celebrity!

“Song Chenyu’s gaze swept across his face without a trace, and he continued, “The temperature here is too high! I was still wearing my coat when I got on the plane! I didn’t expect it to be 35 degrees when I got off the plane.””

The topic of being an Internet celebrity was deflected by song Chenyu just like that.

The director secretly praised Song Chenyu’s Eq.

“Song Yiwan looked at Song Chenyu. “Chenyu, do you live in the capital?””

Song Chenyu nodded. “I spend most of my time in the capital.”

“Song yiwan smiled and said, “I also came from the capital. The highest temperature in the capital today is only 15 degrees.””

“Yeah.”

The few of them chatted from the capital to their homes.

“Knock, Knock, Knock”

“Not long after, there was another knock on the door in the quiet courtyard.”

The others had gone to pack their luggage.

On the other side of the courtyard sat song Chenyu and Lu Qi.

“Perhaps it was because they were far away, and the two of them were having a lively conversation.”

“Therefore, no one heard the knock on the door.”

“In fact, both of them heard it.”

“Now, everyone was here except for Ye Zao.”

Who else could it be other than ye Zao who was knocking on the door?

The corners of Song Chenyu’s mouth curled up slightly.

It could be seen that Lu Qi and the others were quite opposed to ye Zao.

Especially Lu Qi.

“When the two words ‘Internet celebrity’were mentioned, the disdain in his eyes almost appeared.”

“However, it was normal when he thought about it.”

How could a celebrity compare to an internet celebrity?

They were not even on the same level!

Internet celebrities were equivalent to online beggars.

“In this information-rich era, negative news about internet celebrities was flying all over the place.”

It would be strange if they liked Internet celebrities!

“Now that everyone was against foreigners, no one opened the door for ye Zao.”

Ye Zao would definitely be embarrassed to death standing outside alone.

Song Chenyu wanted ye Zao to know that.

She and she were not from the same world.

She was a swan that spread its wings and flew.

Ye Zao was not even a frog at the bottom of a well.

Today was just the beginning.

“In the time to come, ye Zao would be prepared to let her slap him in the face!”

A frog was a frog.

Dreaming of flying up to the branches and becoming a Phoenix?

It was simply a dream!

“At this moment, a thin figure ran out of the inner room and opened the courtyard door.”

The speed was so fast that it was almost impossible to react.

Who Was This?

Why was he so blind?

“Song Chenyu narrowed his eyes and stood up from his chair. “Someone seems to be coming. Lu Qi, let’s go take a look.””

“His expression was very natural, as if he had just found out that someone was knocking on the door.”

“Lu Qi also stood up and said, “Okay.””

The two of them stood up and walked out.

Yin Wei had already opened the door.

“The person outside the door was tall and slender. He wore a black tasseled t-shirt and jeans shorts. His long legs were long and straight, and he wore a pair of black martin boots.”

A slender and fair waist was faintly discernible between the tasseled hem. The collision of black and White was soul-stirring.

She looked cool and wild.

This was too cool!

“Yin Wei was stunned for a moment. Then, she looked up and saw a black cap covering her eyes and brows. Although her face could not be seen clearly, she could still feel the strong aura of this person.”

“Yin Wei immediately apologized, “I’m sorry! We were busy in the room just now and did not hear the knock on the door. Sorry to have kept you waiting.””

“It’s fine.”A fair and slender hand took off the black cap.

A face so perfect that it made people sigh was exposed in the air just like that.

“The girl in front of him had exquisite facial features. There was not a single blemish on her porcelain-white face. Her pair of exquisite phoenix-shaped eyes were sparkling, and it could inadvertently seduce one’s soul.”

The entertainment industry was not lacking in beauties.

“However, even Yin Wei, who was used to seeing beauties in the entertainment industry, was stunned by her beauty.”

“One point was too fat, one point was too thin.”

“One point was too white, and one point was too red.”

“Perhaps, she could no longer be described as good-looking.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Just as she had yet to react, a good-looking hand reached out in front of her. “Hello, I’m Ye From The Wonderful Sound Streamer, Sitara YC. You Can Call Me Ye.””

“Yin Wei only reacted when she heard ye Zao’s voice. She immediately reached out and held ye Zao’s hand. “Hello, Ye. I’m Yin Wei. You can call me Yin Wei directly, or you can call me Wei Wei.””

“I’m Wei Wei.”Ye Zao smiled.

“Yin Wei was a very easy-going girl. She did not have any prejudice against internet celebrities. She immediately held ye Zao’s arm and said, “Ye, come inside with me. They’re all here.””
