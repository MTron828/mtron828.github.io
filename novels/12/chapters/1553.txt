“Hearing this, Tang Xue became even angrier! ”

SL * T!

Tang Mi was a SL * T!

“If she had known this would happen, she would have informed the head examiner when she first accepted Tang Mi. ”

“Tang Xue was so angry that she laughed, “Good, good, good! Tang Mi! You’ve grown wings, haven’t you! You better remember what happened today. In the future, even if you cry and beg me in front of me, I won’t think of any sisterhood! “Today, I will humiliate myself! “I’m a Slut!” ”

“After saying that, Tang Xue turned around and left. She was so angry that fire was about to burst out of her eyes. ”

She had never expected that Tang Mi would be so ungrateful!

“Since she was heartless, then don’t blame her for being unrighteous! ”

“As soon as Tang Xue Left, Cen he walked over from the side and said in disbelief, “Little Stutterer, I didn’t expect you to be such a shrew!” ”

“CEN he remembered Tang Mi as a shy and obedient girl who blushed easily. Therefore, many people in the base liked to make fun of Tang Mi. Today’s Tang Mi had really impressed Cen he! ”

“He had thought that Tang Mi would definitely suffer a loss, but he didn’t expect Tang Mi to win so much that Tang Xue left in a huff. ”

It felt so good just thinking about it!

Cen he hated Tang Xue very much.

“Ever since the aircraft carrier project team was established, Tang Xue had poached countless technical talents over here and left. ”

“Moreover, she was now suspecting that many bad rumors about ye Zao in the base had come from Tang Xue’s side. Coupled with the incident with Professor Yue, Cen he’s impression of Tang Xue was even worse. ”

“”I, I don’t stutter anymore!”Tang mi said. ”

“Tang Mi’s stuttering was only when she was nervous. Ever since she took ye Zao’s medicine, she had stopped stuttering. ”

“Cen he smiled and nodded, “Yes! I can hear it now. You really don’t stutter anymore! Not only do you not stutter, your tongue is also very sharp. Even Tang Xue, who has such high combat strength, is no match for you! TSK TSK TSK, Little Stutterer, you really make me look at you in a new light!” ”

“Hearing this, Tang Mi felt a little embarrassed and continued, “Is there something you need from me?” ”

“OH.”Cen he then remembered the important matter. “Miss Ye wants us to go over for a meeting!” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Got it.”Tang mi nodded. “I’ll pack up and go over right away!”

“”Alright, I’ll wait for you,”Cen he said. ”

...

On the other side.

“After ye Zhuo left, Zhang Qingqing took out her phone and dialed a number. The moment the call connected, she cried out, “Lizi! I don’t want this child anymore! I really can’t take this injustice anymore!” ”

“On the other end of the phone, an Lizi was shocked. “Qingqing, what’s wrong? Calm down and tell me slowly. What’s Wrong?” ”

Zhang Qingqing did not explain and only continued to sob.

“An Lizi was very anxious. After all, Zhang Qingqing was still pregnant. “Qingqing, where are you? Tell me, I’m coming to pick you up!” ”

Zhang Qingqing looked at her surroundings and reported the address to an Lizi.

“An lizi continued, “Qingqing, don’t run around and don’t think too much. Wait Here! I’ll be right there!” ”

“Okay.”Zhang Qingqing nodded.

An Lizi rushed out of the door.

“Just as she walked out, she saw ye Shu walking over with his bag. ”

“Auntie.”An Lizi walked over.

“Ye Shu said, “Lizi, are you going out?” ”

“”Yes.”An Lizi nodded. “There’s something urgent! Auntie, is there something you need me for?” ”

“Ye Shu continued, “I want to ask you about Ah Ze’s girlfriend, Zhang Qingqing.” ”

Lin Ze only said that Zhang Qingqing was an Lizi’s good friend. He did not say anything else.

“Ye Shu wanted to understand Zhang Qingqing, so he could only look for an Lizi. ”

“An Lizi was stunned. “Auntie, You Already Know About Qingqing?” ”

“Ye Shu nodded. “Yes. Moreover, Ah Ze also said that he wanted to marry her. ”

Marry?

An Lizi was stunned again. She never expected that Lin Ze would actually take the initiative to propose marriage. This was very different from what she had imagined.

“”Lizi, I just want to know if this Zhang Qingqing is a good girl! The situation of her family members!”Ye Shu continued to ask. ”

“An Lizi continued, “Since you already know about Qingqing’s matter, then you should come with me!” ”

“Where to?”Ye Shu asked curiously.

An Lizi’s expression was a little unsightly. “To Qingqing’s place. I don’t know what happened to her! She just called and said that she wanted to abort the child!”

Abort the child!

“Hearing this, Ye Shu’s face paled. “Go, go, Go! Then hurry up and Go!” ”

An Lizi nodded.

“The two got into the car, and an Lizi gave the driver the address. ”
