“Chapter 405: 118: when the great burning trap revealed Mu Yourong’s true colors, Li Qiandong was devastated! 1”

Translator: 549690339

“Seeing Mu Yourong so guilty, and even taking all the blame for Shen Rong’s death, Li Qiandong’s heart ached terribly. ”

He had never seen such a kind person like Mu Yourong.

“Yet, all of them had misunderstood mu yourong. ”

Especially Young Lady Cen.

Mu Yourong was her future granddaughter-in-law!

“When he thought of old Madam Cen’s actions last time, Li Qiandong’s heart turned cold. ”

“”Blame me! Blame me! Big Brother Li, Don’t try to excuse me!”Mu Yourong cried so hard that she couldn’t help herself, “It’s all my fault! I didn’t take good care of my mother! I let her down! My mother treated me so well, I’m not worthy to be her daughter! I’m Not Worthy!” ”

“Li Qiandong hugged mu yourong tightly. “Yourong, don’t be like this. If Auntie knew that you were so sad, she wouldn’t be at ease underground.” ”

“Now that Shen Rong was dead and soldier Mu was still in prison, Mu Yourong no longer had any support in this world. ”

He had to think of a way to get Mu Yourong to marry Cen Shaoqing as soon as possible.

Only Cen Shaoqing could give Mu Yourong the best support.

“Thinking of this, Li Qiandong continued, “Yourong, you’re not alone. You still have me, and you still have fifth brother! I definitely have a way to resolve the misunderstanding between you and fifth brother!” ”

“Mu Yourong lay in front of Li Qiandong’s chest, the corners of her mouth curling into a proud smile. ”

Li Qiandong was Cen Shaoqing’s best friend.

“Cen Shaoqing also trusted Li Qiandong very much. With Li Qiandong’s words, Mu Yourong would be at ease! ”

She believed that Li Qiandong definitely had the ability to restore the engagement between her and Cen Shaoqing!

“Mu Yourong finally managed to stop crying with much difficulty. Sobbing, she said, “Big Brother Li, don’t tell fifth master about my mother’s matter, and don’t tell the old madam either. I don’t want them to worry.” ”

“”Yourong, you’re too kind! Do you know that sometimes kindness can not be exchanged for anything!” ”

Mu Yourong was always planning for CEN Shaoqing and the Cen family.

But they... treated mu yourong that way.

Old Madam Cen had even belittled mu yourong to the point of being worthless.

“Thinking of this, Li Qiandong sighed in his heart and continued, “Yourong, don’t worry. I Won’t tell them about this.” ”

It was impossible not to tell!

“Now that Mu Yourong was alone, he had to let the Cen family know the truth and let them bring Mu Yourong to the Cen family. ”

“Because it was summer, Shen Rong was sent to the funeral home on the same day. ”

“On the way, Mu Yourong cried and fainted four times in total. ”

“After comforting Mu Yourong, Li Qiandong set off for the CEN family. ”

He wanted to go to the Cen family’s old lady to pay her respects.

The car had just arrived at the manor’s entrance when it was stopped by the security personnel.

Li Qiandong got down from the car with a face full of anger. “Are You Blind?”

“The security officer said apologetically, “Mr. Li, I’m sorry. Old Mrs. Cen had instructed us not to let you take even half a step in here.” ”

“Li Qiandong said angrily, “How can you believe an old man’s joke? Get lost quickly and let me in!” ”

The two security officers looked at each other and saw the dilemma in each other’s eyes.

“After all, Li Qiandong had a noble status. If they really offended him, they would not be able to bear the consequences. ”

“One of the security personnel said, “Mr. Li, please wait a moment. I’ll go and make a call to ask old Mrs. Cen.” ”

A moment later.

“The security personnel walked out from the pavilion. “Mr. Li, Old Mrs. Cen still won’t let you in. I’ll have to trouble you to return the way you came.” ”

Li Qiandong was stunned.

He had never expected that old Mrs. Cen would actually do it for real.

The old lady was indeed old!

She had actually become so muddle-headed!

“Old Madam Cen did not let him in, so Li Qiandong had no choice but to call the Cen family personally. ”

The person who answered the call was a servant of the Cen family. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Li Qiandong ‘an controlled his anger and said, “Please let Aunt Xiang answer the phone.” ”

“Old Madam Cen was unreasonable, but Zhou Xiang was always reasonable. ”

Zhou Xiang jogged over to answer the phone. “Hello.”

“Li Qiandong said, “Aunt Xiang, it’s me.” ”

“Hearing Li Qiandong’s voice, Zhou Xiang’s attitude immediately changed. “Oh, it’s You! is something the matter?” ”

“Li Qiandong continued, “Aunt Xiang, something has happened!” ”

“What happened?”

“Li Qiandong said, “Yourong, yourong’s mother has passed away from gas poisoning! She’s currently at the Yun Jing City Funeral Home.” ”

“OH.”Zhou Xiang’s tone was indifferent.

“When she and Old Lady Cen had gone to the Mu clan to discuss their marriage, soldier Mu and Shen Rong had joined forces to humiliate her and Old Lady Cen. ”

“Even now, when Zhou Xiang thought of this matter, she still gnashed her teeth in hatred. ”

“Back then, Cen Haifeng had treated the MU clan so well. ”

But the Mu clan had repaid kindness with enmity!
