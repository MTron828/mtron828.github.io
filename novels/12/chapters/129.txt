Chapter 130: 082: How does she match up to him? He doesn’t even have the slightest discernment! 3

Ye Zao took the business card. “Then I’ll have to trouble you.”

“You’re welcome.”

In the crowd, a man in a black windbreaker stood out from the rest.

He looked at ye Zao just like that.

His gaze seemed to be penetrating.

A moment later, he reached out and pressed down on the hat on his head. The wide brim of the hat covered his facial features.

Looking at the scene in front of him.

His ears could not help but recall the words of his assistant from yesterday.

“All of Miss Ye’s information has been encrypted. This side has no access to it.”

Encrypted.

Under normal circumstances, the information of an ordinary person would be encrypted?

Since he could not find out about ye Zhuo’s information, he could only understand her verbally.

What kind of person was she?

Ignorant, stupid, useless, unable to read a few big words...

But now, it seemed that these labels did not match her at all.

When ye Zhuo raised his head to look, there was no sign of him.

Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly.

Could it be an illusion.

After a moment, ye Zhuo withdrew his gaze and looked at Lin Sha who was beside him. “Sister Sha Sha, let’s go.”

“Okay.”Lin Sha nodded slightly.

The two of them walked down the mountain together.

It was said that it was easier to climb up the mountain than to go down, but this saying was not wrong at all.

When they went up the mountain, they climbed up in an hour.

It had been half an hour since they went down the mountain, and they had only covered one-third of the distance.

The two of them chatted as they walked.

“Burning, you’re really good at trapping! Can you teach me!”

Ye Zhuo smiled slightly, “Sure, but sister Sha Sha, don’t you have to revise? Don’t forget, you still have to take the college entrance exam next year.”

“Oh, right.”Lin Sha continued, “Then I’ll study after I finish college.”

Ye Zao continued, “I have a set of revision materials at home. It should be helpful to you. I’ll bring it to you when I get home.”

“Okay! Thank you, Zao Zao.”

“Be careful!”

Just then, ye Zao suddenly reached out and grabbed the man’s wrist.

She was very strong.

The man barely managed to stand, but his body was still a little unsteady. He took the opportunity to sit on the steps and turned to look at Ye Zao. “Thank you.”

This time, he turned his head.

Both of them were stunned.

“Mr. Song?”

“Miss Ye?”

Both of them said almost at the same time.

“Mr. Song Has Low Blood Sugar?”Ye Zao also half-squatted down.

Song Shiyu nodded. His face was a little too pale.

But his lips were red and flirtatious.

It was as if he had put on lipstick.

Ye Zhuo took out a few pieces of candy from his pocket and handed them to him. “I have a few pieces of candy here. Mr. Song, you’ll be fine after you eat them.”

“Thank you.”Song Shiyu took the candy.

“Boss! Are You Alright?” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

At this moment, two men in suits rushed over.

Song Shiyu slowly peeled a piece of candy and put it into his mouth. “I’m fine.”

The sweet and sickly taste spread on the tip of his tongue.

Song Shiyu suddenly looked up at Ye Zhuo, his dark eyes filled with ink. “Miss Ye, where did you buy this candy?”

“Big White Rabbit Milk Candy. I bought it at the supermarket,”ye Zhuo said curiously. “Mr. Song, you haven’t eaten this candy before?”

Big White Rabbit Milk Candy.

Song Shiyu frowned and felt a headache.

Ye Zhuo continued, “Mr. Song, since your assistant is here, I’ll go down the mountain with my friend First.”

Song Shiyu supported his assistant’s hand and stood up. His voice was still a little weak. “Thank you for today, Miss Ye.”

“You’re welcome.”

After ye Zhuo left, song Shiyu extended his hand to his assistant. His face seemed to be covered with a layer of ice. “Give me a pen and paper.”

Knowing his boss’s personality, his assistant always brought pen and paper with him. He immediately passed the pen and paper to Song Shiyu.

Song Shiyu ignored the fact that his hand was still trembling. He sat down on the ground and began to draw.

Beijing.

Feng Qianhua and Feng Xianxian spent the night in the hotel.

This morning, they took the hundred flowers nectar given by old madam Feng to the Lin family to wish Old Madam Lin a happy new year.

When she saw Feng Qianhua and her daughter, Old Madam Lin was instantly at a loss for words.

Feng Qianhua handed the hundred flowers nectar to the maid. “Aunt Lin, this is the hundred flowers nectar that my mother asked me to bring for you. I heard that it’s especially good for old people! When you drink water, remember to put some on it.”

Old Madam Lin chuckled and said, “Your mother is too polite. She didn’t even eat such a good thing and still brought it for me!”

Feng Xianxian smiled and continued, “Grandma Lin, you’re being too polite. My grandmother said that we’re all family. What do you mean by ‘Yours and mine’? There’s no need to be so clear about it.”

These words had finally reached Old Lady Lin’s heart.

To her, Feng Qianhua and Feng Xianxian had long been family with them.
