Translator: 549690339

The South China Sea was close to the equator.

“The temperature was extremely high, and the four seasons were like summer. It was a good place for a winter vacation. ”

Ye Zhuo had a special plot for the sea. It had to be said that Cen Shaoqing’s suggestion had hit the nail on the head.

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “When do we set off?”

“When do you want to set off?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

Ye Zao Thought for a moment. “Can you leave anytime?”

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Then I’ll go back and tell my parents that we’re Leaving Tonight?”Ye Zao said.

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips parted slightly. “Take me back and tell Grandma and the others.”

“It’s decided then.”

Cen Shaoqing drove ye Zao back first.

“Almost as soon as she got into the car, Ye Zao fell asleep in the seat. ”

“Her breathing was shallow, and the sunlight shone in through the car window, casting a layer of golden light on her face. ”

It was especially beautiful.

“Cen Shaoqing turned his eyes slightly and subconsciously slowed down the car, turning down the music in the car. ”

“After an unknown amount of time, when ye Zao woke up, the car had already stopped in front of the Lin family manor. ”

Ye Zao slowly opened his eyes. He was stunned for a moment before he turned to look at Cen Shaoqing. “You’re here?” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“”Yes.”Cen Shaoqing also took a nap. At this moment, his voice sounded a little lazy. ”

“Ye Zao continued, “When did you arrive? Why didn’t you call me?” ”

“”I just arrived for a while. I also slept for a while,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

Ye Zao nodded slightly.

Cen Shaoqing went around to the other side and opened the car door for ye Zhuo. “I won’t go in.”

“After going to Nanhai for a while, he still had to return with some close-fitting clothes. ”

Cen Shaoqing had a strange habit. He didn’t like others touching his close-fitting clothes.

Even his biological mother couldn’t do it.

“Ye Zhuo said, “Well, you should go back quickly. It’s getting late.” ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Ye Zao instructed, “Drive slowly on the road.” ”

“I know.”

“After the car disappeared in front of them, Ye Zao turned around and walked into the house. ”

Lin Ze and Bai Jingshu had been living in the Lin family manor ever since their marriage.

“When Bai Jingshu saw ye Zao return, she smiled and said, “Zao Zao is back.” ”

“Sister-in-law.”

“Bai Jingshu immediately walked over and took the bag from ye Zao’s hands. “I was just talking to mom about you. I thought you wouldn’t be back today. If I had known that you were back, I would have asked the kitchen to prepare more dishes.” ”

A very ordinary girl was different.

Ye Zao ate a lot.

“He especially loved desserts, so every time ye Zao ate at home, the kitchen would prepare a large table of dishes and also prepare a few desserts before and after the meal. ”

“Ye Zao said, “Sister-in-law, don’t trouble yourself. I still have to leave later.” ”

“You’re not eating at home?”Bai Jingshu asked.

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Just eat something.” ”

“”How can I just eat something? ! I just learned how to make a dessert recently. Wait here, I’ll make it for you to try,”Bai Jingshu said. ”

Bai Jingshu liked ye Zao very much.

That was because ye Zao was a very good sister-in-law.

“Since ancient times, the relationship between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law was the most difficult to handle. However, in the Lin family, there were no such difficult relationships. ”

Ye Shu and Lin Jincheng treated her like their own daughter.

Ye Zhuo even treated her like his older sister.

“In the Lin family, she felt a long-lost affection for her family. This was something she had never experienced from her parents in the past twenty years. ”

“”Sister-in-law, there’s really no need to go through so much trouble.”Ye Zhuo held Bai Jingshu’s arm. “Where’s Mom?” ”

“Bai Jingshu said, “I think she’s upstairs! By the way, where are you going tonight? When are you coming back?” ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “I’m going to the South China Sea for a vacation. I’m too tired recently, and my nerves are very tense. I plan to have a good rest.” ”

Ye Zhuo was a person who did not easily say that he was tired.

“But this time, it really made her physically and mentally exhausted. ”

“”It’s time for you to have a good rest.”Bai Jingshu continued, “Use this time to give yourself a good vacation.” ”

“”Yeah.”Ye Zhuo seemed to have thought of something. “Sister-in-law, are you going to play with my brother too? I remember that you guys haven’t gone out to play since you got married.” ”

“Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “We won’t go. We’ll go again when we have time.” ”

“It was obvious that ye Zhuo wanted to go out to play with Cen Shaoqing. If the two of them were to follow him, wouldn’t they become a third wheel? ”

Bai Jingshu was not the kind of person who was insensible.

“”Alright then.”Ye Zhuo continued, “Has my brother been very busy recently?” ”

“”He’s quite busy.”Bai Jingshu nodded. “He leaves early and returns late every day. After we settle things here, we still have to make a trip to the s galaxy.” ”
