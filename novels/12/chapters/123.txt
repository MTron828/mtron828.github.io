Chapter 124: 079: confirmed return date, strange bite Mark 3

How laughable.

Cheng Fengqin pursed her lips and put on a fake smile. “Plans can’t keep up with changes. There are some things you shouldn’t say too early.”

“Second sister-in-law is right. I’m just afraid that some people will end up spending eighteen years of their youth in vain!”Ding Xuemin replied sarcastically.

Feng Qianhua’s expression changed.

But she was sneering in her heart.

Just wait!

The day she sat on the Lin family’s mistress’throne, she would make these people regret their actions today!

At this moment, Old Madam Feng came down from upstairs.

When she heard her two daughters-in-law’s sarcasm towards Feng Qianhua, she did not stop them. She looked up at Feng Qianhua, “Your two sisters-in-law are right. A woman can not waste another eighteen years! I think boss Shen is indeed not bad. He will not mistreat you and Xianxian.”

After saying that, old madam Feng continued, “Although boss Shen doesn’t look as good as you think, he is rich and powerful. I heard that the new high-ranking official is a relative of his family!”

After saying that, old madam Feng paused and said earnestly, “Don’t delay yourself for a man who doesn’t have you in his heart. I’m your mother. I Won’t harm you!”

Hearing this, Feng Qianhua’s eyes revealed a hint of mockery.

She had always been a shrewd mother.

Even when half of her body was about to be buried, she still didn’t forget to pave a bridge and build a road for her four sons.

Who would benefit the most from her marrying boss Shen?

The Feng family, of course!

She really thought she was so gullible!

In order to marry Lin Jincheng, she had waited eighteen years.

How could she give up just like that!

Compared to Lin Jincheng, Boss Shen was nothing?

He couldn’t even compare to one of Lin Jincheng’s little fingers.

Feng Qianhua said, “Mom, I Know You Won’t harm me, but I don’t have a relationship with Boss Shen. In the future, don’t say such things anymore. By the way, have you seen Xianxian?”

“Mom, are you looking for me?”Feng Xianxian and her nieces and nephews walked in from outside.

Feng Qianhua nodded. “Tonight, we’re going to your uncle Lin’s house for the New Year. You should go and make some preparations.”

“Really?”Feng Qianqian’s eyes lit up.

Feng Qianqian was very happy to see Feng Qianhua and Lin Jincheng succeed.

Compared to the Feng family’s cousin,.

She wanted to be the legitimate eldest daughter of the Lin family.

The Lin family and the Cen family were close friends.

At that time, she would be able to get to know fifth master Cen and become Madam Cen.

Feng Qianhua nodded. “Quickly go and clean up.”

“I’ll go right away.”Feng Xianxian quickly ran into the house.

Old Madam Feng looked at Feng qianhua thoughtfully and said, “I still have a bottle of authentic hundred flower nectar here. Qiao’er brought it back from the mountains last time. You can bring it to old madam Lin later.”

Feng Qianhua curled her lips. “Then I’ll thank you on behalf of Aunt Lin.”

Old Madam Feng instructed the servants to get the hundred flowers nectar.

Not long after, Feng Xianxian came out after changing her clothes.

At this moment, Feng Qianhua’s phone rang.

When she picked up the phone, Feng Qianhua’s expression obviously changed, but it quickly returned to normal. She hung up the phone with a smile and waved at Feng Xianxian. “Xianxian, your grandma Lin Called to urge us. Let’s go over quickly!”

“Okay.”Feng Xianxian nodded. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Feng Qianhua told Old Madam Feng to take care of her. Ignoring the expressions of the others in the room, she directly took Feng Xianxian away.

“Tch! What are you so proud of!”Cheng Fengqin snorted coldly.

Ding Xuemin also couldn’t stand this annoying sister-in-law. “That’s right! Who doesn’t know that Lin Jincheng doesn’t like her at all!”

“Both of you, shut up!”Old Madam Feng said in a deep voice, “When she marries into the Lin family, there will be benefits for both of you! Don’t you even know how to put on an Act? You have shallow eyelids!”

The air instantly became quiet.

Cheng Fengqin and Ding Xuemin looked at each other, not daring to say anything more.

After walking out of the Feng family’s villa, the expression on Feng Qianhua’s face changed from sunny to cloudy.

She sat on the Internet to book a car and left the villa area.

Feng Qianqian asked curiously, “Eh, why didn’t Grandma Lin send a car to pick us up?”

Feng Qianhua kept a straight face and didn’t say anything.

Feng Qianqian was especially good at Reading Feng Qianhua’s expression. When she saw this, she immediately sat up straight and looked at her nose and heart.

She didn’t dare to say anything else.

Feng Qianhua was very strict with Feng Qianqian.

She had to stand and sit.

She had to be proficient in all kinds of music, chess, calligraphy and painting.

Feng Xianxian hardly had a childhood because she spent her childhood in various training classes.

Even now, Feng Qianhua was still very strict with Feng Xianxian.
