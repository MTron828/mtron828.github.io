Zhao Xueyin hid her thoughts in the bottom of her eyes and used the corner of her eyes to observe the expressions of the people around her.

Deng Deng Deng —

“Following the sound of footsteps, the lawyer walked straight over. ”

Zhao Xueyin puffed out her chest and looked at the lawyer.

The words of rejection were on the tip of her tongue.

“Next, let her reject the lawyer in front of everyone! ”

“At this moment, Si lui walked past Zhao Xueyin and slowly said, “Old Lady Ming.” ” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Old Lady Ming?

Didn’t Si lui come to confess to her?

The smile on Zhao Xueyin’s face froze at the corner of her mouth.

What was going on?

“On the side, Wen Si Lan’s voice was filled with regret. “After all this time, it turns out that I was overthinking things!”She really thought that Jin Ruyu was here to greet her. ”

She did not expect that Jin Ruyu was just passing by.

“After saying that, Wen si lan said, “That’s right. How could a handsome young master like Jin Ruyu, who prefers to be refined and refined, take a fancy to us Philistines? I’ve indeed been overthinking things!” ”

“Hearing this, Zhao Xueyin felt a little uncomfortable in her heart. ”

Philistine?

“If she was a philistine, would the lawyer have liked her for so many years? ”

Si Lui didn’t greet her just now because he didn’t see her.

“There were so many people at the banquet, so it was normal for Si lui not to see her. ”

Zhao Xueyin comforted herself in her heart and turned to look at Si lui.

“”This is ruyu, right?”Old Lady Ming looked at Si lui with a kind smile on her face. ”

“”Old Lady, I Am Ruyu.”Si lui nodded. “My father has been feeling unwell recently, so he asked me to come and celebrate your birthday. I hope old lady will not take offense.” ”

“”No offense, what’s there to take offense at!”Old Lady Ming grabbed Si Lui’s hand, “Good child, your father and I are old acquaintances. When we were young, we fought side by side. You can just call me grandma. What Old Lady! You’re too unfamiliar!” ”

Call Me Grandma?

“Hearing this, everyone looked at each other and saw the confusion in each other’s eyes. ”

“”Grandma,”si lui called out politely. ”

“Old Lady Ming smiled when she heard him call her grandma, then, she said, “Oh right, ruyu, let me introduce you. This is my granddaughter, Ming Yao. She’s 26 years old this year and has just returned from abroad. Yaoyao, this is the kid from the Jin family that Grandma told you about, Jin Ruyu.” ”

“When she saw this scene, Zhao Xueyin narrowed her eyes. ”

What did Old Lady Ming Mean?

Disguised matchmaking for Si?

Ming Yao?

Who does Ming Yao think she is!

SI’s favorite person should be her!

What does Ming Yao Want?

To Be a mistress?

“According to Si’s personality, he would definitely reject Ming Yao without hesitation. ”

He would embarrass Ming Yao in front of everyone.

“After all, she was the person Si loved the most. ”

Si lui hated this kind of disguised blind date the most.

“Besides, how could a woman like Ming Yao, who had no beauty at all, enter Si Lui’s eyes? ”

Just wait.

Ming Yao was about to embarrass herself.

“Thinking of this, Zhao Xueyin’s lips curled up, and her eyes were filled with joy. ”

“Wen Si Lan next to her continued, “One of them is the heir of the Jin family, and the other is the young miss of the Ming family. From the looks of it, the young miss of the Ming family and Jin Ruyu are quite compatible.” ”

Compatible?

Compatible with what?

A mocking light flashed across Zhao Xueyin’s eyes.

She was clearly the only one worthy of being a lawyer.

Just wait!

Ming Yao was about to make a fool of herself!

“At this moment, the lawyer extended his hand towards Ming Yao. “Hello, Young Miss Ming. I Am Jin Ruyu. I Am Jin from the Jin dynasty. A stranger is as beautiful as jade.” ”

“Ming Yao smiled and said, “A stranger is as beautiful as jade. Young Master is unparalleled in this world. Your name is very nice to hear.” ”

“”Thank you, Miss Ming.” ”

“”Ming Yao.”Ming Yao held the lawyer’s hand generously. “Tomorrow’s Ming, the Yao of the Yao Lake. Mr. Jin, you don’t have to be so polite. Just Call Me Ming Yao.” ”

“”Okay, then Miss Ming, you don’t have to be so polite. Just Call Me Jin Ruyu.” ”

Zhao Xueyin was completely stunned on the spot.

She thought that the lawyer would embarrass Ming Yao.

She didn’t expect that the lawyer would chat so happily with Ming Yao.

How could this be?

“Looking at this scene, Zhao Xueyin’s heart was about to burst with jealousy. ”

It was unbearable.

Why didn’t the lawyer reject Ming Yao?

Was he giving Old Lady Ming face?

Yes.

It must be like this.

Zhao Xueyin took a deep breath.

“Seeing that the two young people were chatting so well, Old Lady Ming was very gratified. She continued, “Don’t you have wechat now? Yaoyao, quickly add Ruyu’s wechat so that we can chat more in the future.” ”
