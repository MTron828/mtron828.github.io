In fact.

Even Feng Xianxian herself did not think that she could get full marks.

“After all, this year’s exam questions were very difficult. They covered all the difficult questions from both ancient and modern times. If one was not a talented person, there was no way to start.”

“The moment she saw the exam papers, even Feng Xianxian was stunned.”

She even felt that she did not know where to start.

“Fortunately, she had read the information that Liu Caiyi had given her in advance.”

“If Liu Caiyi had not shown her a portion of the exam questions in advance, she would not have gotten full marks.”

Feng Xianxian was a very grateful person.

“She knew that this time, it was all thanks to Liu Caiyi!”

“If it was not for Liu Caiyi, she would not be the person she was now.”

“Liu caiyi smiled and said, “I only played a supporting role. The one who should be thanked is still you. It was your hard work that won all of this.”The information that she had shown Feng Xianxian included half of the answers, at that time, they did not know which half of the questions would appear on the test questions.”

“Therefore, Feng Xianxian had to fully grasp all the questions and answers on the information.”

“If it was someone with average talent, would they be able to memorize all the questions and answers in such a short time?”

“No one would be able to do it, right?”

This meant that she did not misjudge the person.

Feng Xianxian also did not disappoint her.

Liu Caiyi was very satisfied with Feng Xianxian!

“Old Madam Lin was a little dumbfounded when she heard this. She stood up from her chair in disbelief. “President Liu, are you saying that our Xianxian got a perfect score?””

“Liu Caiyi nodded. “Not only a perfect score, but it’s the only perfect score in the literary world in the past 15 years.””

The only perfect score in the past 15 years?

Old Lady Lin was stunned.

She had never thought that Feng Xianxian would be so amazing.

She had never thought that Feng Xianxian would bring her such glory!

The only perfect score in the past 15 years!

This was enough to prove Feng Xianxian’s strength.

“”President Liu, are you not joking with me?”Old Lady Lin asked in disbelief.”

“Liu caiyi smiled and said, “Of course it’s true. Why would I joke with you about something like this?””

“Good! That’s Great!”Old Lady Lin was very excited at this moment. She wanted to let everyone know about this news.

“Feng Xianxian looked at old lady lin, “Grandma, the main examiner hasn’t announced the results yet. Don’t be so excited. Let’s sit down first.”Now, everyone was guessing who the person who got a perfect score was.”

She had to maintain her mysteriousness!

“Then, she would give everyone an unexpected answer!”

“Old Lady Lin smiled and said, “Right, right, right! Now is not the time to get excited! Let’s wait for the main examiner to announce the results! Then, we can go onstage and receive the award in a glorious manner!””

“When Feng Xianxian went onstage, she would definitely shock everyone!”

The disciple that master Yu personally took a fancy to turned in his papers two hours earlier and was ranked last.

“Feng Xianxian, on the other hand, had scored full marks for the disciple that master Yu had looked down on.”

How could master Yu have any face left?

Master Yu would definitely regret not taking Feng Xianxian as his disciple.

It was a pity.

There was no medicine for regret in this world for Master Yu.

“The More Old Lady Lin thought about it, the more excited she became. It was as if she had already seen master Yu’s regretful face.”

Old Lady Lin had even thought about how she would talk to Master Yu later.

“”Xianxian, if master Yu comes to look for you later, don’t bother with him,”Old Lady Lin instructed Feng Xianxian.”

“Feng Xianxian said hesitantly, “This... This isn’t very good, is it?””

Old Lady Lin snorted coldly. “What’s so bad about this! Wasn’t that how he rejected you back then?”It was also because Feng Xianxian had a good heart and was unwilling to argue with master Yu.

“Feng Xianxian did not want to argue with master Yu, but Old Lady Lin could not.”

She could not stand Feng Xianxian being wronged.

“Feng Xianxian smiled and said, “Alright Grandma, I understand.””

Old Lady Lin patted Feng Xianxian’s hand in satisfaction.

Feng Xianxian pulled Old Lady Lin to sit down in her seat. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“On the field, the thirty instructors who were grading the examination papers were also stunned.”

None of them had expected that there would be a contestant with full marks in this year’s assessment competition.

One had to know.

This year’s assessment competition was the most difficult year in recent years.

“In the past few years, they hadn’t even gotten full marks for common difficult questions.”

But this year.

“In the most difficult year in history, someone had actually gotten full marks!”

This was simply heaven-defying!

It was simply impossible to imagine what kind of person would be able to get full marks.

“The full score examination paper directly alerted the highest-level leader in the literary world, Li Zhentian.”

“Li Zhentian directly went to the examination venue. “Teacher Wang, I heard that you changed the examination paper to a full score?””
