Translator: 549690339

Xu Yao is so considerate.

“If it were anyone else, they wouldn’t be as considerate as Xu Yao. ”

“After all, Xu Yao was just injured. ”

A wounded woman needs comfort the most.

Especially from her boyfriend.

“The more considerate Xu Yao was, the more he ziteng felt guilty. ”

He was not a good boyfriend.

A good boyfriend would never let his girlfriend suffer such injustice.

“”Yaoyao, I’m sorry.” ”

“Xu Yao smiled and said, “Ziteng, what are you talking about! Don’t talk like that. I’ve already said that I don’t blame anyone for this! Alright, Hurry up and go to work! Don’t Be Late!” ”

Xu Yao considerately stuffed the briefcase into he ziteng’s hands.

He ziteng took the briefcase and kissed Xu Yao on the forehead. “Then I’ll be leaving first.”

“Okay.”Xu Yao nodded. “Drive slowly on the road. I’ll wait for you at home.”

“Okay.”

“After watching he ziteng get into the car, Xu Yao returned to the apartment. ”

“Just then, her phone vibrated. ”

Xu Yao looked at the text message and narrowed her eyes.

“[ Yaoyao, I know that you had no choice back then. Since God wants us to reunite, it means that he wants to give us a chance, a chance to fall in love again. ] ”

“After so many years, Xu Yao heard the excitement in her heart again. ”

He still loved her.

“After so many years, he still remembered her. ”

Xu Yao couldn’t tell what she felt in her heart.

She was very excited.

She was also very happy.

This feeling of being remembered until now was really blissful.

The person who sent the text message wasn’t anyone else.

It was Xu Yao’s first love.

The school Belle from high school.

“When they met again, the two of them acted very calm, as if they had never known each other. ”

She didn’t expect that he still loved her.

What was even more unexpected to Xu Yao was that he would take the initiative to send her a message first.

“Just as Xu Yao was in a daze, another text message came in. ”

“[ Yaoyao, I really love you. Come and meet me. Do you still remember that hug we agreed on? ] ”

The kids in high school were all rather childish.

“Back then, when Xu Yao broke up with him, they had agreed that if they ever met again in their lifetime, they would give each other a hug. ”

“If he hadn’t brought this up on his own initiative, Xu Yao would have long forgotten about it. ”

“She didn’t expect that after so many years, he would still remember it. ”

“When she thought of that promise again, Xu Yao’s face turned red. ”

She was looking forward to meeting him this time.

“After a long while, she replied with a ‘okay’. ”

“At three in the afternoon, Xu Yao arrived at the cafe on the road on time. ”

“When she arrived, the waiter immediately came out and said with a smile, “Miss Xu, right? Mr. Mi is already waiting for you inside.” ”

Xu Yao nodded and followed the waiter’s footsteps.

“First Love was sitting in the VIP room. When she saw Xu Yao, she immediately stood up. “Yaoyao.” ”

“”Mi Chen,”Xu Yao said. ”

“Mi Chen was wearing a pair of gold-rimmed glasses. She looked gentle and elegant. After all, she was the school’s Scarecrow. Her looks wouldn’t be too bad. Otherwise, Xu Yao wouldn’t have remembered her until today. ”

“If he ziteng was here, he would definitely be able to tell that this Mi Chen was the he family’s family doctor. ”

The person who helped Xu Yao bandage her wound yesterday was Mi Chen.

“Mi Chen looked at Xu Yao with an affectionate expression. She pulled out a chair for Xu Yao and said slowly, “Yaoyao, I thought you wouldn’t come to see me.” ”

“”Since I promised you, I won’t eat salt,”Xu Yao said. ”

“Mi Chen continued, “I brought your favorite milk tea from high school.” ”

“Thank you.”Xu Yao reached out to take it.

“It was different in front of he ziteng. In front of Mi Chen, Xu Yao didn’t need to pretend. After all, they were lovers. ”

“Mi chen smiled and said, “Yaoyao, when did you become so estranged from me?” ”

“Xu Yao stuck the straw in and took a sip of the milk tea. Then she said, “Mi Chen, I think you saw it yesterday. I have a boyfriend now.” ”

They could no longer go back to the past.

“So What?”Mi Chen looked at Xu Yao with a faint smile. “I know you don’t really like he ziteng.” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Xu Yao didn’t see any love in he ziteng’s eyes.

“Only that stupid pig, he ziteng, would be deceived. ”

Xu Yao smiled. “I will marry he ziteng and become Mrs. He.”

“”I don’t mind.”Mi Chen clasped her hands together. “Yaoyao, you should know how much I love you. I Don’t care who you marry. I just want you to give me a little bit of your love. Just a little bit.” ”

Xu Yao was stunned. Her heart was racing.

Mi Chen said he didn’t mind.

Did he mean that he was willing to be together with he ziteng and have her?

“Bang, Bang, Bang — ”

Xu Yao’s heart beat faster and faster.

“Mi Chen continued, “Yaoyao, the He family is very complicated. It Won’t be easy for you to marry into them. However, as long as you want to, I will help you!” ”

“Really?”Xu Yao asked.

“”Yes.”Mi Chen nodded. “Yaoyao, do you want to be pregnant with He Ziteng’s Child?” ”

Xu Yao was stunned. She just looked at Mi Chen and didn’t say anything for a long time.

“Mi Chen took out a bottle of pills. “Eat it. After you eat it, you can successfully be pregnant with he ziteng’s child.” ”

“Why should I believe you?”Xu Yao asked.

“”Because I love you. Because I can do anything for you.”Mi Chen looked at Xu Yao. “Yaoyao, in this world, no one loves you more than me!” ”

Xu Yao didn’t take the pills from Mi Chen.

What if it was poisonous?

Some people would destroy what they couldn’t get.

What if Mi Chen wanted to destroy her?

She couldn’t take such a risk.

“Mi Chen seemed to have read Xu Yao’s mind. She poured two pills from the bottle and swallowed them. “Yaoyao, Can You Trust Me Now?” ”

Xu Yao took the bottle from Mi Chen. “These pills can really help me get pregnant.”

“Mi Chen nodded. “Yaoyao, I won’t lie to anyone. No matter what, you can trust me unconditionally.” ”

Xu Yao glanced at Mi Chen.

She was a little excited and had a sense of superiority.

“The feeling of being liked and remembered by others was pretty good. This meant that she had her own personality and charm. If it was someone else, Mi Chen would have given her everything! ”

She was even willing to have her with he ziteng.

“Mi Chen looked at Xu Yao. “Yaoyao, so now you’re willing to trust me?” ”

“Xu Yao nodded and continued, “Where did you go after you graduated from high school?” ”

“”I studied medicine,”Mi Chen replied. ”

“After so many years of separation, it was inevitable that sparks would fly when they reunited. ”

“Soon, the two of them sat on a chair. ”

“Mi Chen held Xu Yao in her arms and greedily breathed in her scent. “Yaoyao, have I missed you all these years?” ”

Xu Yao leaned against his chest. “Haven’t you had any other girlfriends?”

“No.”Mi Chen shook her head. “I’ve been waiting for you.”

Xu Yao smiled. “How do I know if you’re lying to me?”

“”Yaoyao, do you think I’ll lie to You?”The next second, Mi Chen kissed Xu Yao. ”

Xu Yao was immersed in the kiss.

“The two of them were inseparable. Just as Mi Chen was about to make her next move, Xu Yao consciously stopped him. “Not yet.” ”

Although she really wanted to.

She was not pregnant with he ziteng’s child yet.

“According to the He family’s parents’personality, they would definitely take a paternity test after the child was born. ”

“If they found out that the child wasn’t he ziteng’s, then all her efforts would have been for naught. ”

“Xu Yao didn’t notice that when she said this, a trace of haze flashed across Mi Chen’s eyes. It lasted for a moment before she smiled and said, “Okay.” ”

It had already been two hours since they left the coffee shop.

Xu Yao returned to He Ziteng’s apartment.

“Although she had already gone back, her heart still couldn’t calm down for a long time. ”

“She and Mi Chen were in love for the first time, and they were truly in love. Therefore, she really liked the feeling of being together. ”

It would be great if she and Mi Chen could meet openly.

Unfortunately.

She couldn’t have it both ways.

She and Mi Chen were destined to be in the dark.

Xu Yao patted her face to stop herself from thinking too much and letting others see the clues. The most important thing for her now was to coax he ziteng.

“Since he ziteng made breakfast for her, she would make dinner for him. He ziteng must be very touched that she could still cook for him even though she was injured. ”

“At nine o’clock in the evening, he ziteng came back on time. When he saw the table full of food, he asked in surprise, “Yaoyao, did you cook all this?” ”

Xu Yao nodded. “Sit down and eat! It will be cold soon!”

“He ziteng continued, “In the future, just let the servants do these things. You Don’t have to do it yourself. You’re still injured!” ”

“Xu Yao smiled and said, “What’s this little injury? It’ll be a joke if people know!” ”

He ziteng walked over and hugged Xu Yao.

“In a corner that he ziteng could not see, Xu Yao curved her lips slightly. ”

“That night, Xu Yao ate a pill that Mi Chen gave her. ”

“It was a very ordinary pill. It didn’t have much of a taste, and she didn’t know if it would be that magical. ”

“In the afternoon, he ziteng suddenly brought someone back. ”

“When she saw who it was, Xu Yao was shocked. ”

“He ziteng introduced, “Yaoyao, you should still remember him, right? He’s our family doctor, Doctor Mi Chen. I’ll get him to examine your wound.” ”
