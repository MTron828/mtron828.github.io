“After saying that, ye Zao took Zhao Pingting’s phone and placed “53”on the table in front of Zhao Pingting, “If you have time, watch less of your phone and do more of “53”. Pingting, do you still want to take the test to Beijing with me?” ”

“Zhao pingting whimpered, “Da Zao Zao Zao, it’s impossible for me to get into Beijing University. It’s already good enough for me to get into Beijing Normal University!” ”

Although Beijing Normal University was not as impressive as Beijing Normal University.

It was still an important book.

“Zhao Pingting’s results were average. With Ye Zhuo’s help, although her results had improved a lot, it was still a little difficult for her to get into Beijing Normal University. ”

“”Do five or three more and you’ll get in.”Ye Zhuo took out a notebook from his desk and handed it to Zhao Pingting, “By the way, this is my summary of knowledge points and some college entrance exam questions. Take a look and it will help you.” ” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

The Things Ye Zhuo gave her were 100 times more useful than the review materials. Zhao Pingting’s results were improved because of the notes ye Zhuo gave her.

“”Zhuozhuo, I love you so much!”Zhao Pingting hugged ye Zhuo excitedly. ”

“Soon, it was Saturday. ”

Half past five.

Ye Zha left home on time.

She was wearing a simple green dress.

“Green was a very picky color. Even if her skin tone was slightly darker, it would not be able to suppress such a bright color. ”

“Ye Zha’s skin tone was fair and her facial features were exquisite and flawless. When she wore this green dress, it was as if this color was made for her. It was obviously a very simple and low-key style, but it made her look like a big shot. ”

“In an instant, everything in the world lost their color. ”

Ye Zao had just walked out of the door.

A low-key Maybus suddenly stopped by the roadside.

The car window rolled down.

A face as gentle as jade was revealed.

“Ye Zao.”

“Song Shiyu?”Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly.

Song Shiyu nodded slightly. “Where are you going?”

“”The Venus International Hotel,”ye Zao said. ”

“Song Shiyu continued, “I just happen to have something to do over there. I’ll bring you there on the way.” ”

“Is it too much trouble?”Ye Zao was a little embarrassed.

“It’s just a matter of stepping on the accelerator.”

“Since he had already said that, ye Zao did not refuse. “Then thank you.” ”

“After saying that, he opened the car door and sat inside. ”

A Faint Mint fragrance lingered in the car.

It was a very fresh smell.

It smelled very good.

“However, Ye Zhuo did not like the airtight environment, so he lowered the car window by half and continued, “How is Grandma Song recently?” ”

“Song Shiyu said, “After taking your medicine, her mental state has improved a lot recently. She keeps saying that she needs to find an opportunity to thank you properly.” ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “Grandma song is too polite.” ”

Song Shiyu looked ahead. He held the keyboard with one hand and took out a beautiful small box from the shelf with the other.

“There are some candies in here. Do you want to try them?”

“Thank you.”Ye Zhuo reached out and pinched a big white rabbit milk candy.

“In a short while, the car arrived at the Venus International Hotel. ”

Song Shiyu got out of the car and opened the door for her.

Ye Zao thanked her again.

Song Shiyu looked at ye Zao like this. The evening light cast a layer of light on his face. “You’ve been saying thank you ever since we got in the car. There’s no need to be so formal between friends.”

“Ye Zao smiled slightly. “Alright, drive carefully on the road then. I’ll treat you to a meal when I have time.” ”

“Okay.”Song Shiyu nodded slightly.

From Afar.

The two of them looked rather intimate.

“One was noble and beautiful, with an aura like an orchid. ”

“The other was gentle and jade-like, with an extraordinary bearing. ”

“Standing together, these two people attracted the attention of countless people. ”

This scene also stopped in front of the eyes of the man in the luxury car not far away.

“The man held a Buddhist bead in one hand, and the other hand was on the steering wheel. He was wearing a buttoned-up long gown, and his sharp facial features seemed to be covered with an impenetrable layer of thin ice. ”

It made people shudder.

“In a moment, he took out a cigarette from his pocket. The choking smell of tobacco filled his entire mouth. When the smoke in front of him dissipated, the Maybach in front of him had already disappeared. ”

She was still standing there in a green dress.

“After greeting song Shiyu, Ye Zao was just about to walk in when a gentle voice came from behind him, “Sister Ye Zao.” ”

Ye Zao turned his head slightly and saw Mu Yourong in a red evening gown.

“As the saying goes, you should never hit a smiling person. Ye Zao smiled faintly and said, “Miss Mu.” ”

Mu Yourong thought that she had seen wrongly.

She did not expect that this person was really ye Zao.

Li Qiandong had actually invited ye Zao as well.
