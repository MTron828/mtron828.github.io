Translator: 549690339

“Just then, old Mrs. Lin suddenly found that her phone was in her pocket. ”

She could call the police.

Call the police and arrest Feng Xianxian.

“Old Mrs. Lin wanted to take out her phone to call the police, but her hands didn’t listen to her. ”

“At this time, she was like meat on a chopping board. ”

She could only be slaughtered.

Would Feng Xianxian kill her to vent her anger?

“Perhaps, Feng Xianxian had gone into the house to get a murder weapon? ”

“She had already had a conflict with Lin Jin Cheng and the others, and she had treated Feng Xianxian so well. Even if Feng Xianxian really killed her, no one would suspect anything ”

What should she do?

What should she do now?

She could not die just like that.

“If she died, who would reveal Feng Xianxian’s true colors. ”

“The More Old Lady Lin thought about it, the more panicked she became. She could only shout in her heart, “Jin Cheng, come and save mom...” ” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“”Ah Ze, Chouzhuo, Grandma was wrong...” ”

“Grandma is sorry.”

“”And Qingxuan, Qingxuan, Mom was wrong. Mom really was wrong. Mom shouldn’t have stopped your marriage with Xiaoman.” ”

“Not long after, Old Lady Lin’s face was covered in tears. ”

Tap Tap Tap —

“Five minutes later, the sound of Feng Xianxian’s footsteps appeared in the living room again. ”

Old Lady Lin couldn’t do anything. She could only watch as the footsteps got closer and closer to her.

Was she going to die?

“Even if she was a ghost, she wouldn’t let this B * Tch Feng Xianxian off! ”

“At this moment, Feng Xianxian stopped beside Old Lady Lin. She reached out and pressed Old Lady Lin’s hand. Then, she took out the printing ink and pressed Old Lady Lin’s thumb into the printing ink. ”

Printing Mud?

What is Feng Xianxian trying to do?

What is she trying to do?

“At this moment, Old Lady Lin saw Feng Xianxian take out a document. Then, Feng Xianxian pressed a handprint on her thumb on the document. ”

Share Rights?

“When she saw the five big words on the document, Old Lady Lin woke up from her dream. ”

It turned out.

It turned out that Feng Xianxian was here for the shares of the LIN Group!

No.

She couldn’t let Feng Xianxian take the shares of the LIN Group.

Old Lady Lin wanted to struggle.

But she couldn’t struggle at all.

She could only glare at Feng Xianxian.

“Looking at Feng Xianxian’s face, Old Lady Lin wished she could stand up and bite her to death! ”

But she couldn’t do anything now.

She could only watch helplessly as Feng Xianxian used her hand to imprint her fingerprint on the share rights.

Not only that.

Feng Qianqian even imitated Old Lady Lin’s handwriting and wrote a will.

“The main content of the will was that if anything unfortunate happened to Old Lady Lin, Feng Qianqian would inherit everything in the Lin family. Lin Jincheng and ye Shu would not get a single cent. ”

Slut!

Feng Qianqian was a slut!

“After pressing the fingerprint, Feng Qianqian put away the will and the share rights agreement. Then, she seemed to have changed into a different person, crying, she said, “Grandma, What’s Wrong With You? What’s wrong with you? Just wait, I’ll call 120 immediately! I’ll definitely save you!” ”

Feng Xianxian hurriedly called 120.

She had already asked Gao Di.

“At the age of Old Lady Lin, once she had a stroke, even the gods would not be able to save her! ”

Old Lady Lin knew what Feng Xianxian was planning.

But she could not stop Feng Xianxian.

“She could only pray in her heart that the doctor could help her recover. She had to tear Feng Xianxian’s true face apart with her own hands. Otherwise, even if she died, she would not be able to close her eyes. ”

120 came very quickly.

“Twenty minutes later, Old Lady Lin appeared on the emergency table. ”

Feng Xianxian waited anxiously outside the emergency room.

Yes.

She was very anxious.

She was afraid that an accident would happen. What if Old Mrs. Lin was cured?

Feng Xianxian paced back and forth.

“Two and a half hours later, the door of the emergency room was opened and a doctor in a white coat walked out. ”

“Feng Xianxian hurriedly walked over. “Doctor, how is my grandmother?” ”

“The Doctor took off the mask on his face and said regretfully, “Although the patient was saved, she may not be able to stand up again in the future.” ”

“Feng Xianxian heaved a sigh of relief, but she still looked very anxious. “Then can my grandmother speak normally?” ”

The doctor shook his head.

No.

That’s great.

That’s really great.

“Feng Xianxian sniffed, with red eyes, she said, “Doctor, can you tell me why my grandmother suddenly became like this? Will she really not be able to stand up again in the future? My grandmother is a very strong person. She Can’t stand up and she can’t speak. How will she be able to live?” ”

“The doctor looked at Feng Xianxian, “The patient is old and all the organs in her body are failing. I’m not very sure about the exact cause of the stroke. Your family members should also be more open-minded and take good care of the elderly. Maybe one day, they will see a miracle.” ”
