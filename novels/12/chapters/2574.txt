“I’m almost bored to death.”Ye Zhuo stretched lazily.

“She did not care about trifles and did whatever she wanted to do. She simply had a good body. No matter what she did, she was very beautiful. ”

“Cen Shaoqing smiled and said, “Then why didn’t you come out earlier?” ”

“”I’m lacking one person. I’m embarrassed to come out.”After saying that, ye Zhuo continued, “And I won money in the first half.”There was an unwritten rule in the card game. The loser did not mention leaving the game, the person who won definitely could not speak first. ”

“CEN Shaoqing said, “So there’s such a saying.” ”

“Ye Zhuo said, “It’s always others surrounding you. Of course you don’t know.” ”

Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads. “What’s the use of that? Don’t I still have to be around you now?”

Ye Zhuo chuckled.

She realized that she was losing out to Cen Shaoqing.

In the inner room.

An Lizi brought buttface to meet her relatives.

“There were too many relatives in an Lizi’s family. Buttface was already feeling a little dizzy. “Lizi, I’m starting to lose track of who’s with whom.” ”

“”It’s alright.”An lizi smiled and said, “You can just follow behind me and bark. Look at that. That’s my third cousin, Wang Bin. He’s going to be a second-year grad student this year.” ”

“Okay.”Dog two nodded.

The two walked toward Wang Bin.

“Third cousin.”

“Lizi.”

“Wang bin smiled and said, “Your boyfriend is very good. He has good taste.” ”

“”Thank you, third cousin,”dog two said. ”

“Wang bin put his arm around an Lizi’s shoulder and said, “Lizi, I have something to ask you. Come with me.” ”

“Okay.”An Lizi nodded.

The two of them came to the door.

“Wang bin lowered his voice and asked, “Who is that girl in the White T-shirt?” ”

“Which one?”An Lizi asked.FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“”The one who is the most beautiful,”Wang bin Said. ”

“An Lizi said, “You mean burning?” ”

“”I think so.”Wang bin continued, “I don’t know her name, but she is the most beautiful one. Her skin is very white and she has a bun on her head.” ”

“You mean that?”An Lizi happened to see ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing walking by the artificial lake.

“Wang bin followed an Lizi’s line of sight and nodded excitedly. “Yes, yes, yes, that’s her!” ”

“An Lizi said, “She’s fifth uncle’s daughter.” ”

“Wang bin continued, “She’s really beautiful. Can you introduce her to me?” ”

“”Are you crazy?”An Lizi was a little speechless. “Do you know who she is? Besides, she already has a fiancée!” ”

“Hearing this, Wang bin Said nonchalantly, “She can still get a divorce after getting married. What’s there to be afraid of if she has a fiancé?” ”

“An Lizi frowned. This Wang Bin had never been on the right path since he was young. She had thought that after so many years, this person would change. She did not expect that a dog would never change! ”

“With so many people around today, an Lizi did not want to embarrass him. She continued, “Do you know Fifth Master Cen?” ”

“Yes.”Wang bin nodded.

“An Lizi continued, “Fifth Master Cen is burning’s fiancé.” ”

“At this point, an Lizi lowered her voice. “There was once a person who had the same thoughts as you. He had thoughts that he shouldn’t have. After that, he lost an eye.” ”

“Don’t be an alarmist!”Wang bin Said.

“An lizi smiled and said, “Whether it’s an alarmist or not, you’ll know once you try it! But Don’t blame me for not reminding you. If Cen Wu is ruthless, he won’t recognize anyone. When that time comes, he won’t care who you are!” ”

“Wang bin gulped and smiled, “Look at you, why are you so serious! I was just joking! It was just a joke!” ”

“”Sorry, I took it seriously!”An Lizi continued, “Wang Bin, it’s none of my business how you play in your own house, but this is the Lin Family!” ”

“After saying this, an Lizi turned around and left. ”

“Wang bin kept smiling along, “Yes, yes, yes, I was wrong. It was just a joke, just a joke!” ”

“When an Lizi’s figure disappeared, the smile on Wang Bin’s face disappeared completely. He snorted coldly, “Bah! What the hell! You’re really treating yourself like a big shot!” ”
