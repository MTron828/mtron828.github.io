“Chapter 302: 103: wise brother Ze, Old Lady Cen is the king of tricks! 4”

Translator: 549690339

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “That’s right.”

“Li Qiandong said in surprise, “Then this Miracle Doctor Ye can’t be a god, right?” ”

“”I’m not sure, but it’s very possible.”Cen Shaoqing’s expression was the same as usual. ”

Ye Zhuo was more low-key.

The rumored Miracle Doctor Ye was also very low-key.

These two people just happened to match up.

“Li Qiandong frowned, then he said, “The Almighty is so busy, busy with scientific research, busy playing games, busy with live broadcasts, and also busy with the college entrance exam. She shouldn’t be so free, right? “I heard that Miss Mu’s medical skills are also quite good. Do you think it’s Miss Mu?” ”

“Although ye Zhuo was really very powerful,. ”

Ye Zhuo was too busy!

He was busy with this and that all day long. How could he have time to study cancer antibodies?

This seemed a little unrealistic.

Mu Yourong had already retired from the live broadcast world. Li Qiandong still believed that it was Mu Yourong.

Cen Shaoqing raised his head to look at Li Qiandong. “You still want to eat pig large intestine sashimi?”

Li Qiandong immediately recalled his bet with Cen Shaoqing not too long ago.

Cen Shaoqing was especially ruthless.

“If he said ten catties of pig large intestine, then ten catties of pig large intestine. ”

“After eating ten catties of pig large intestine raw, Li Qiandong went to the hospital overnight to have his stomach pumped. As a result, when he heard the words ‘pig large intestine’, his footsteps became weak and his face turned pale. ”

“Li Qiandong continued, “Fifth brother, why do you have such a deep prejudice against Miss Mu? Although the god is very outstanding, Miss Mu is not bad either! Miss Mu is kind-hearted and versatile. She is really a very good girl!” ”

“”Fifth brother, are you still angry about the annulment of the marriage? Actually, I feel that there is really a misunderstanding about this matter. Why Don’t I help you make an appointment with Miss Mu? The two of you can meet face-to-face and explain this matter clearly?” ”

“If there was a misunderstanding, then it had to be resolved. ”

Cen Shaoqing could not stay single forever.

“Moreover, a powerhouse like Cen Shaoqing would definitely not like another powerhouse, so it was definitely impossible for him and ye Zhuo to be together. ”

“After all, as the saying goes, ‘use softness to overcome hardness’. ”

“Therefore, Mu Yourong was simply a good match. ”

She was worthy of Cen Shaoqing in every aspect.

“Most importantly, Mu Yourong really needed Cen Shaoqing. ”

“Cen Shaoqing’s expression was indifferent. He glanced at Li Qiandong and said, “Get out.” ”

“His voice was very faint, but it contained endless pressure that made people shudder. ”

It scared Li Qiandong so much that he shut his mouth.

“However, Li Qiandong was still a little unwilling. “Fifth brother, you really misunderstood mu...” ”

Cen Shaoqing raised his head slightly and opened his thin lips. “Aren’t you leaving yet?”

“Although Cen Shaoqing didn’t have any special expression on his face, Li Qiandong knew that this lord was really angry. ”

“I’m leaving! I’m leaving Right Now!”

Li Qiandong ran out in a hurry.

He was afraid that he would be blamed by this person in the next second.

“Although Cen Shaoqing usually did not lose his temper, he always looked calm and collected. He held a string of Buddhist beads in his hand at all times and muttered Amitabha. In fact, only Li Qiandong knew about it. ”

This person was hiding a knife in his smile!

Buddha’s mouth was like a snake’s heart.

“If he did not have some tricks up his sleeve, how could he have gotten to where he was today? ”

...

The Cen family.

Zhou Xiang was chatting with old Mrs. Cen.

“”Mom, Yunjing is close to the sea. I heard that there’s a small island with a pretty good view. Since we’re bored at home, why don’t we go on a vacation?” ”

“A small island?”Old Mrs. Cen rolled her eyes. “Is there a lot of people on that island?”

“Zhou Xiang shook his head. “It’s a private island. There are no other tourists, but the view is really good!” ”

Old Mrs. Cen was amused when she heard that. “Then call Yezi and Shaoqing along.”

Ye Zhuo was so beautiful and so outstanding. Old Mrs. Cen was worried every day that her granddaughter-in-law would be kidnapped by someone with bad intentions.

“Yezi is easy to talk about. Would Shaoqing be willing to go?”Zhou Xiang frowned slightly. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Cen Shaoqing had a strange personality.

“When he was free, he would rather go to a nearby temple to listen to the Buddhist music than go out for a vacation. ”

Go to a small island for a vacation?

That seemed a little unlikely.

“Old Mrs. Cen narrowed her eyes and chuckled twice. Anyone who heard it would know that there was a conspiracy hidden in her laughter. As she laughed, she reached out her hand to Pat Zhou Xiang’s shoulder. ”

Zhou Xiang felt a chill run down his spine. He shrank back and avoided old Mrs. Cen’s hand.

“When she patted the air, Old Mrs. Cen turned her head speechlessly. “You’re not a bastard, why are you shrinking?” ”

“Zhou xiang whimpered, “I’m afraid of you smiling like that...” ”

She had been with old Mrs. Cen’s mother-in-law for almost forty years.

Zhou Xiang knew her too well.

“Every time the old lady smiled like that, she must be planning something big. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen smiled and said, “What are you afraid of? Don’t worry, I’m not a good person!” ”
