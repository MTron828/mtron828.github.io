“When she returned to the ward again, Xie Wanqiu had already eaten half of the oil tea fruit. “Yinyin, call Zhou Xiang for me.” ”

“Call second aunt?”Zheng Wanyin was stunned.

“Xie wanqiu nodded. “Yes, tell her that if I don’t see Shaoqing coming to the hospital to visit me by tomorrow morning, then I won’t have her as a daughter in the future!” ”

“Zheng Wanyin frowned. “This... This isn’t good, is it?” ”

“”What’s not good about it?”Xie Wanqiu’s expression was very ugly. “If I tell you to hit me, then hit me!” ”

“Okay.”

“Since Xie Wanqiu had already said so, Zheng Wanyin could only do as she was told. ”

Zhou Xiang felt a headache coming on when he received the call.

He did not know what to do.

“Cen Shaoqing was a stubborn person. If he did not want to do something, not to mention a mother like her, even if old madam Cen stepped in, Cen Shaoqing would not do it. ”

“At this moment, Zhou Xiang suddenly thought of someone. ”

Ye Zhuo.

“Ye Zhuo was a variable in Cen Shaoqing’s life. If ye Zhuo spoke, Cen Shaoqing would definitely go to the hospital to visit Xie Wanqiu. ”

Right.

She should have called Ye Zhuo.

Why didn’t she think of that just now?

Zhou Xiang called Ye Zhuo.

“Very soon, the call went through. ”

Ye Zhuo was sitting in the room drawing.

“Old Mrs. Cen ran up with her phone. “Zao Zao, your phone is ringing!” ”

“Whose is it?”Ye Zao looked back slightly.

“”It seems to be from Xiang Xiang,”old Mrs. Cen said. ”

“Ye Zao took the phone and put it on the table. He turned on the speakerphone and controlled the mouse with one hand and the keyboard with the other. He was multitasking. “Hello, Auntie.” ”

“”Zao Zao, are you busy now?”Zhou Xiang asked. ”

“”No, please tell me.” ”

“Zhou Xiang thought for a moment and then said, “Zao Zao, Auntie wants to ask you for a favor.” ”

“What favor?”

Zhou Xiang cut to the chase. “I want you to talk to Shaoqing and ask him to visit his grandmother.”

“When she heard this, Old Madam Cen couldn’t stay calm. ”

What was Zhou Xiang doing?

Aiding the wicked!

People like Xie Wanqiu could just ignore them.

Zhou Xiang insisted on rushing over and sticking a warm face to her butt.

“No matter what she said, she couldn’t do it. ”

“If it weren’t for the fact that Zhou Xiang usually didn’t have any serious problems, old madam Cen would have scolded her. ”

“Old Madam Cen picked up her phone. “I won’t agree to it! Have I given her face? She even wants Shaoqing to go see her. Why doesn’t she go to heaven? Xiangxiang, how many times have I told you? Why Can’t You Learn Your Lesson?” ”

“On the other end of the phone, Zhou Xiang was stunned. After a long while, she said,”... Mother?” ”

“”If you still acknowledge me as your mother, then don’t bother about Xie wanqiu anymore.”Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Shaoqing’s grandmother has been gone for more than 30 years. What kind of grandmother is she?” ”

“Zhou Xiang sighed. “Mother, home is peaceful and everything is prosperous.” ”

“Actually, she really did not want to bother with Xie wanqiu. Now, she was forced into a corner. ”

“If one person took a step back, wouldn’t the sky and the sea open up? ”

Zhou Xiang did not want to see the scene of the house being restless and chaotic.

“”Xiangxiang! I’ve tolerated you for a long time! Don’t force me to Scold You!”Old Mrs. Cen’s voice suddenly turned cold, “I’ll say it one last time. If you’re like this, in the future, we’ll go our separate ways! The main road is facing the sky, and we’ll go our separate ways!” ”

Zhou Xiang’s personality was really too soft.

There was no need to use force.

“Zhou Xiang could tell that old Mrs. Cen was serious. “Mom, I got it.” ”

“After hanging up, Zhou Xiang’s face was full of sadness. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen put her hands on her hips. “Bah! Xie wanqiu, that trash!” ”

“After saying that, old Mrs. Cen realized that something was wrong. She looked at ye Zao and said with a smile, “Yezi, Yezi, don’t misunderstand! Actually, grandma is usually very civilized! That was just an illusion, an illusion!” ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Grandma Cen, what’s Going On?” ”

“”It’s still that Xie Wanqiu!”Old Mrs. Cen continued, “After she was angered by her own embarrassing granddaughter and was hospitalized last time, she created some shameless tricks again! “Actually, this is also Xiangxiang’s fault. If she hadn’t been patient, Xie Wanqiu wouldn’t have climbed on top of her head to take a shit!” ”

“Ye Zhuo said, “Actually, Auntie and my mother used to be quite similar. As long as we can get past this hurdle, we’ll be fine.” ”

“Previously, Ye Shu had also been exploited by the Ye family like this. ”

She swallowed her anger.

Old Mrs. Cen waved her hand. “She can’t be compared to your mother!”

“After saying that, old Mrs. Cen continued, “I’d better go back and take a look!”Old Mrs. Cen originally didn’t want to get involved in this matter, but now that Zhou Xiang was like this, she was very worried. She had to supervise Zhou Xiang! ”VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience
