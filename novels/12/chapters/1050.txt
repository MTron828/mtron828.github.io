An aircraft carrier?

“With the current technology, not to mention an aircraft carrier, even a slightly high-tech spaceship could not be developed. ”

Ye Zao looked serious. “I’m not joking with you.”

An Lizi was very cooperative. “Then when will your aircraft carrier be built?”

“It will take about two years.”

“An lizi continued, “When the aircraft carrier is successfully built, you have to treat Pingting and me to a meal!” ”

“No problem.”

“An Lizi had a smile on her face. “Scorching hot, when did you become so good at bragging?” ”

“Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly. He was too lazy to explain. He took the movie tickets and said, “It’s time. We can enter the cinema now.” ”

“Let’s go.”An Lizi stood up from her chair.

The three of them walked out of the movie theater.

“After watching the movie, they went to have supper. Ye Zao drove the two of them back. ”

“An Lizi, Xia Xiaoman, and Lin Xiaoman lived in a villa in the suburbs. ”

“Zhao pingting said, “Zao Zao, just send me to No. 560 Xuanwu Road. I’ll go to my childhood home.” ”

“”Okay.”Ye Zao nodded slightly. “Then I’ll send you there first. Then, I’ll send Lizi Home.” ”

“Okay.”

“Xuanwu road was not far from here, and they arrived in about 10 minutes. Zhao Pingting pushed the door open and got out. “Da Zao, Lizi, I’m leaving first.” ”

“Goodbye!”Ye Zao and an Lizi waved at her.

“Ye Zao instructed, “Pingting, it’s not safe at night these days. If you and your childhood friend have nothing to do, try not to wander around at night.” ”

The serial killer from last time had yet to be caught.

The three missing girls had already found two bodies.

“I know. You guys should leave quickly.”

“Zhao Pingting’s childhood friend was the same age as Zhao Pingting. The two of them had agreed to go to the zoo together tomorrow, so Zhao Pingting stayed at her childhood friend’s house tonight. ”

“Just as Zhao Pingting got out of the car, her phone rang. ”

“It was a call from her childhood friend. “Hello! Pingting, I’m sorry! I have some urgent matters to attend to at my grandmother’s house. I might not be able to come back in the next few days. We Can’t go to the zoo together tomorrow!” ”

“”It’s fine. Let’s meet again another day.”Zhao pingting hung up the phone. Her childhood friend was not at home, so she could only return to school first! ”

Zhao Pingting used the taxi app and called for an express car.

The car arrived very quickly. Zhao Pingting opened the car door and got into the car.

“The driver said, “Are you going to normal university?” ”

“Yes.”Zhao pingting nodded.

The driver started the engine and the car slowly drove on the road.

“About five minutes later, the driver handed over a cup of milk tea from the driver’s seat. “It’s cold. Have a cup of milk tea to warm your body.” ”

“Thank you.”Zhao Pingting took the cup of milk tea and took a sip. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

She did not see the inexplicable smile on the driver’s face after she drank the milk tea.

“After drinking a mouthful of milk tea, Zhao Pingting felt a little dizzy. Then, a wave of sleepiness hit her. Her upper and lower eyelids seemed to have been sealed by glue. She could not open them no matter how hard she tried. ”

“When Zhao Pingting woke up again, she was surrounded by darkness, and the air was filled with a damp and dark smell. ”

“If she didn’t hear wrongly, there was also the sound of a woman sobbing. ”

“Zhao Pingting tried to move, but she found that her hands were tied up with ropes. ”

Was she dreaming?

PA —

“At this moment, a light lit up the room. ”

“The sudden bright light made Zhao pingting close her eyes in discomfort. Before she could react, a sinister male voice sounded in the air, “B * Tch! Who told you to cry! Don’t Cry! I’ll Make You Cry! I’ll Make You Cry!” ”

Bang Bang Bang!

The next sound was the sound of a heavy object hitting the wall.

Zhao Pingting opened her eyes and saw this scene.

A ferocious-looking man was grabbing a woman by the hair and smashing her head against the wall.

A sense of fear immediately spread throughout Zhao Pingting’s body.

Where was this place?

It was also at this moment that Zhao Pingting discovered that she was locked in an iron cage with a chain tied around her neck.

There were several iron cages beside her.

“Two of the cages were empty, and three of the cages held three women. ”

“The women were terrified and curled up in the cages, shivering. ”

Zhao Pingting looked at the scene in front of her. Her face was pale and blood flowed out of her body.

“Could she, could she still walk out of here alive? ”

Who would save her?
