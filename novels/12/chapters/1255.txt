10% .

There was only a 10% chance of healing.

“Hearing this, the light in Father Zhao’s eyes quickly dimmed. ”

What to do...

“Ye Zhuo’s medical skills were so good that even Han Dongliang, who was on the verge of death, could be brought back to life. But now, she only had a 10% chance of healing ye Sen. This meant that the poison in Ye Sen was too difficult to cure... ”

Father Zhao was very regretful now.

He wished he could slap himself to death.

“If it were not for him, Ye Sen would not have become like this. ”

It was his fault.

It was all his fault!

Ye Sen blamed himself.

“Ye Shu held ye Zao’s hand and held back her tears. “Let’s not talk about 10% . Even if there is only a 1% chance, we have to try!” ”

Ye Zao still had a 10% chance. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“If he had 10% confidence, he could see hope. ”

It was better than listening to the Doctor and waiting for death!

“Ye Langhua nodded. “Ah Shu is right. As long as there’s hope, it’s good.” ”

“Father Zhao looked up at Ye Zao. “Chief Ye, then I’ll have to trouble you with my son. Please, you must...” ”

“”He’s my uncle. It’s my duty to try my best.”Ye Zao interrupted father Zhao and continued, “Also, old Mister Zhao, my uncle’s surname is Ye. Please watch your words.” ”

“After he finished speaking, ye Zhuo turned to look at Ye Shu. “Mom, where’s uncle’s attending physician?” ”

He had to negotiate with the attending physician before performing Ye Sen’s surgery at the hospital.

Ye Shu wiped her tears. “I’ll bring you there.”

Ye Zhuo followed ye Shu’s footsteps.

The attending physician’s office was on the third floor around the corner.

“”Hello, is doctor Li Around?”Ye Shu walked to the door and asked the nurse beside her. ”

“The nurse glanced at ye Shu and continued, “Are You Ye Sen’s family member?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Shu nodded. “I’m Ye Sen’s sister.”

“The nurse continued, “Doctor Li knew that your family member would come to look for him, so he specially asked me to wait for you here. He wanted me to tell you that he has done his best, but ye Sen’s injuries are too serious! “He had no choice. Please treat life and death with a normal heart.” ”

Many patients were unwilling to accept the death sentence and wanted to negotiate with the doctor.

Little did they know that it was unnecessary.

“If the doctor could save him, would he let it go? ”

“”You misunderstood,”ye Shu continued, “We just want to see Doctor Li. This is my daughter. She has a 10% chance of making my brother recover, so we want to discuss with doctor Li about my brother’s current situation.” ”

A 10% chance of making ye Sen recover?

“Hearing this, the nurse raised her head and looked at Ye Zao, her eyes full of disbelief. ”

How Old was she?

“After all, Dr. Li was a graduate student who had returned from studying abroad! ”

Could it be that Dr. Li was worse than a little girl?

“Although she thought so, the nurse did not show it. She continued, “Then wait a moment, I’ll go ask Dr. Li.” ”

“”Okay, then I’ll have to trouble you.”Ye Shu nodded. ”

The nurse turned around and walked into the office.

“Doctor Li.”

“Yes.”Doctor Li drank a mouthful of goji berry water from the Thermos flask. “What’s Wrong?”

“The nurse continued, “You guessed right. Ye Sen’s family is here.” ”

Doctor Li closed the flask. “What did you tell them?”

“The nurse said, “I told them what you said. However, Ye Sen’s sister said that her daughter has a 10% chance of curing ye Sen. They said that they would like to discuss ye Sen’s current situation with you.” ”

“Sister Ye Sen’s Daughter?”Doctor Li frowned slightly. “How old is she?”

“The nurse thought for a moment and said, “About 17 or 18 years old.” ”

Seventeen or eighteen years old?

“Doctor Li originally wanted to meet his niece, but when he heard that she was only seventeen or eighteen years old, he immediately dismissed the idea and continued, “Just say that I don’t have the time.” ”

Their daily job was to save lives and help the injured. They could not casually waste time in the hands of the Grim Reaper.

“Okay.”The nurse nodded. “I understand.”

“Go.”

The nurse turned around and walked out of the door.

“When she saw the nurse come out, Ye Shu quickly went up to her and asked, “How is it? is doctor Li willing to meet us?” ”

The nurse shook her head. “I’m really sorry. Our doctor Li is not free to meet you guys right now.”

Ye Zhuo took out his phone and looked at the time. His voice was clear and shallow. “When is he free? I Can Wait a moment.”

“The nurse shook her head. “We, Dr. Li, are very busy. I’m not too sure exactly when he will be free.” ”
