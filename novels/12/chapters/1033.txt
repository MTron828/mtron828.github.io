What exactly happened?

“Zhao Xueyin continued, “Big Brother Si, when you went to the XI family, did you see ye Langhua’s biological daughter?” ”

“There must be a reason why ye Langhua suddenly removed Xi Weiyue’s identity as the heir. Perhaps, she wanted to help her biological daughter up. ”

“No matter how good XI Weiyue was, she was still an outsider. How could she compare to her own daughter? ”

There must be a reason behind this.

Si Lu nodded. “I saw it.”

“How is it?”Zhao Xueyin asked.

“Xi Weiyue had nothing to do with Ye Langhua. Her talent was normal. If XI Weiyue had joined the Shunxi Corporation, Zhao Xueyin would not have taken Xi Weiyue to heart at all. ”

But Ye Langhua was different.

“Ye Langhua was a famous talent in the capital. If it were not for the sudden accident, her life would not have turned out like this. ”

“Ye Banyue, ye Langhua’s biological daughter, would more or less inherit some of ye Langhua’s genes! ”

“If the Zhao family wanted to take over the ownership of Shunxi Financial Group and promote to an aristocratic family, they had to have the ye family in their hands. ”

“After all, grandfather ye owned 60% of the shares of the Shunxi Financial Group. ”

Knowing Yourself and your enemy would win every battle!

Zhao Xueyin never fought unprepared battles.

Si lui recalled the scene of the Xi family. Jiang Yan was trembling even when she spoke to him. This kind of person was not worthy of Zhao Xueyin’s fear.

“”Ye Langhua’s biological daughter, Ye Banyue, is a very ordinary person. She’s so ordinary that she can’t even be seen in the crowd. You Don’t have to worry.” ”

“Zhao Xueyin narrowed her eyes. “I’m afraid that things will change. Brother Si, can I trouble you to go and take a look again?” ”

She was still a little worried if she did not investigate thoroughly.

“Sure.”Si Lu nodded.

“”Thank you, brother Si.” ”

“Si Lu smiled and said, “You don’t have to be so polite with me.” ”

Xi Weiyue was directly thrown downstairs by a few security personnel at the Shunxi Financial Group.

“Her clothes were in a mess, and her hair was in a mess. She looked a little disheveled. ”

“Just 20 minutes ago, Xi Weiyue was still proudly following behind the lawyer, but 20 minutes later, Xi Weiyue was thrown downstairs in such a disheveled state. This made the employees in the lobby on the first floor very curious, and they all turned to look at her, their eyes were full of interest. ”

Xi Weiyue had never been humiliated like this in her entire life!

Zhao Xueyin was too daring!

How dare she treat her like this!

She must make Zhao Xueyin pay the price.

“Although ye Langhua was not in the Shunxi Financial Group, her position in the Shunxi Financial Group was still there. ”

Wait!

She must chase Zhao Xueyin out of the Financial Group!

Xi Weiyue picked up her phone and called ye Langhua.

“At this moment, she suddenly saw the lawyer coming down from upstairs. ”

Xi Weiyue narrowed her eyes.

What was the lawyer doing here?

Could he be apologizing to her?

He must be!

What was Zhao Xueyin trying to do?

Slap her first and then give her a date?

Did he really think she was that easy to bully?

Xi Weiyue walked to the lawyer’s side. “Are you here to apologize on behalf of Zhao Xueyin?”

“The bodyguard beside the lawyer was about to stop Xi Weiyue, but he was stopped by the lawyer’s gaze. ”

“XI weiyue continued, “I don’t accept your apology! If Zhao Xueyin wants me to forgive her, then tell her to get down quickly and bow to me in front of everyone!” ”

“The corners of Si Lui’s mouth curled up slightly. “Miss XI, do you still understand your own situation? You Want Xueyin to apologize to you? In Your Next Life!” ”

The smile on Xi Weiyue’s face froze. “Si lui! What do you mean? ! You have to understand that I’m grandfather Ye’s heir! I’m Grandfather Ye’s granddaughter!”

Si lui glanced at her and then turned to leave.

“Although it was just a glance, xi weiyue could clearly see the sarcasm in his eyes. ”

Xi Weiyue was not a fool.

“At this moment, she had already vaguely realized that something was not right. She quickly took out her phone and continued to call ye Langhua. ”

“However, the call was busy. ”

“Under normal circumstances, only when she was blocked would the line be busy. ”

Would Ye Langhua block her?

Of course not!

Could it be that ye Langhua lost his phone?

“Xi Weiyue called XI Muwen again, but no one picked up. ”

Yang Jiao’s phone was also not picked up. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Xi Muwen’s situation was at its peak.

“First, Xi Empire’s products were reported, causing the stock to fall and fall. Then, the mysterious CEO suddenly appeared and forcefully bought Xi Empire! ”

“Now, the only person who could save Xi Empire was ye Langhua! ”
