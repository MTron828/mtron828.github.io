“Elder Wu downed the wine in his glass in one gulp, choosing his words carefully in his heart. “Miss Ye, I wonder if you’re interested...” ”

“”I’m not interested, and I don’t have the time!”Master Yu stood up and interrupted elder Wu. ”

“Elder Wu was not embarrassed and continued, “Miss Ye hasn’t expressed her stance yet. How do you know that she’s not interested?” ”

“Ye Zhuo looked at elder Wu. “Elder Wu, my master is right. I’m still in university. I really don’t have the time to cultivate other interests.” ”

Master Yu nodded in satisfaction.

His disciple had really given him face!

These three old fellows must be dying of envy for him.

Elder Wu and the others were indeed very envious of Master Yu.

Why did such a good thing happen to master Yu?

“In order to prevent ye Zao from being deceived by others, master Yu immediately took ye Zao away after the meal. ”

“On the way, master yu said earnestly, “Zao Zao, don’t be deceived by those old men! They are all trying to trick you into becoming their disciple!” ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Don’t worry. You are my only master in this life.” ”

Master Yu felt much more relaxed after taking some reassurance.

“After returning, master Yu brought ye Zao around the Sea of Books Club. ”

“By the time ye Zao returned to the hotel, it was already past seven in the evening. ”

“In the hotel, an Lizi and Zhao pingting were still not back. ”

Ye Zao went to the bathroom and planned to take a bath.

“After ye Zao finished taking a bath and came out of the bathroom, an Lizi and Zhao Pingting came back with big and small bags of things. ”

“”Zao Zao, you’re back.”An Lizi threw the things on the sofa and lay down on the bed. “I’m so tired today!” ”

“I’m tired too!”Zhao Pingting lay down as well.

Ye Zao wiped his hair. “Where did you guys go to be so tired?”

“Zhao pingting said weakly, “I was so tired after being brought by two little brothers to the streets for a whole day! But C city is really a good place. There are many delicious things and many fun things!” ”

“At this moment, there was a knock on the door. ”

Ye Zhuo walked over to open the door.

It was the hotel room manager.

“Because he had just taken a shower, ye Zhuo was wearing a white nightgown with a sling. ”

Water was dripping from the ends of his hair to his neck.

He looked like a beauty coming out of the shower.

“The manager controlled his gaze and continued, “Miss Ye, Congratulations on becoming our hotel’s 1008th Lucky Customer. This is the dessert our hotel prepared for the lucky customer. Please try it.” ”

He did not dare to look at this person carelessly.

“After all, the Big Boss lived next door. ”

Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly. “Does this mean that I’ve won the lottery?”

“That’s right.”

Ye Zhuo took the dessert with both hands. “Thank you.”

“”You’re welcome. It’s my pleasure.”The manager continued, “If Miss Ye needs anything, you can call us anytime. If there’s nothing else, I’ll be leaving first.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“After the manager left, Ye Zhuo closed the door. ”

He entered the room.

“An lizi asked curiously, “Zhuo Zhuo, who is it?” ”

“The hotel manager said that I won the lottery and sent me a piece of dessert. Do the two of you want to come over and try it together?”

“Forget it. I’ve gained a pound this month!”

“Zhao pingting continued, “A pound is nothing! I’m already two pounds!” ”

“Since the two of them did not eat, ye Zhuo could only enjoy it alone. ”

She would never get tired of desserts.

“After the manager gave the desserts to ye zhuo, he went to the room next door. ”

A figure was sitting at the desk with his back facing him.

“After a while, the man slowly asked, “Have you sent the things over?” ”

“”Yes, Boss.” ”

“The man nodded and continued, “You can leave now.” ”

“As if he had been granted amnesty, the manager immediately walked out of the door. ”

“After the manager left, song Shiyu put the hair clip back into the crystal box. ”

“Three days later, Ye Zhuo, an Lizi, and Zhao Pingting boarded the plane back to Beijing. ”

At the same time.

Song Shiyu also flew to Beijing.

“Song Chenyu, who was filming, suddenly received a call. “Third Brother is in Beijing? Okay! I’ll go prepare immediately!” ”

“Song Chenyu did not even change into her costume. She greeted the director and got into the nanny van. She instructed the driver, “Go to Yu Garden.” ”

“Alright.”

The car traveled very fast. They arrived at Yu garden half an hour later.

Yu garden was a famous wealthy district in Beijing.

Song Chenyu also bought an apartment there.

“It was 90 square meters, 45 million yuan. ”

Everything in Beijing was good except that the prices were expensive.

“Back then, Song Chenyu came to the capital alone to make a living. From nothing to a famous celebrity now, no one knew what she had experienced. ”
