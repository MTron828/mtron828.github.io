There were only a handful of people in the entire dessert area.

“I like to get along with desserts.”Ye Zhuo passed a dessert to Granny Zhou. “Do you want to Try This?”

“Granny Zhou was so frightened that she hurriedly waved her hand. “I’ve had diabetes for many years, so I can’t Eat Sweet Things.” ”

“Then.., granny Zhou continued, “I used to be like you, and I also loved to eat desserts. Now, I haven’t eaten sweet things for more than 20 years. Usually, I even eat a small amount of rice. “Miss Ye, you should also eat less sweet food. Some illnesses can’t be seen when you’re young, but when you’re old, you’ll suffer! “I’m a good example!” ”

“Speaking of which, Granny Zhou was also very regretful. ”

“If she had known earlier, she would have restrained herself when she was young. ”

Diabetes?

“Hearing this, Ye Zhuo raised his hand slightly. ”

“Immediately, an attendant walked over. “Miss, do you have any instructions?” ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Please give me a piece of paper and a pen.” ”

“The attendant nodded. “Alright, Please Wait a moment.” ”

“Granny Zhou asked curiously, “Miss Ye, what do you need a pen for?” ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and looked up. “Granny Zhou, you can just call me by my name.” ”

“Granny Zhou smiled and said, “I heard that everyone calls you searing hot, so I’ll call you searing hot too, right?” ”

“Sure.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Granny Zhou continued, “Searing, you haven’t told me yet. Why do you need a pen and paper?” ”

Ye Zhuo remained mysterious. “You’ll know in a while.”

“Soon, the waiter came over with a pen and paper. “Miss, this is what you want.” ”

“Thank you.”Ye Zhuo took the pen and paper and lowered her head to write.

She wrote very quickly and finished writing.

“Before Granny Zhou could see what was written on the paper, she had already finished writing. She handed the paper to Granny Zhou and said, “Granny Zhou, this is a prescription that can treat diabetes. Please go back and try it.” ”

Prescription?

Treat Diabetes?

Granny Zhou was a little stunned.

“After a while, Granny Zhou finally reacted and said in disbelief, “This prescription can really treat diabetes?”In recent years, Granny Zhou had gone to many hospitals at home and abroad, but she had not been able to cure diabetes, fortunately, diabetes was not a life-threatening disease. She just had to pay attention to her diet. ”

“However, although diabetes was not a life-threatening disease, it was still a disease. It was different from a normal person. Granny Zhou was very uncomfortable with the fear of her mouth. ”

People lived with their mouths open.

No one could empathize with the feeling of wanting to eat something but not being able to control it.

Ye Zao nodded slightly. “Of course.”

“Granny Zhou folded the prescription very seriously. “Alright, thank you, Zao Zao! I’ll definitely give it a try when I get back!” ”

“”Okay.”Ye Zao smiled and said, “After you’re done, you can eat these desserts as you please. You Don’t have to be afraid of your mouth anymore.” ”

“You really don’t have to be afraid of your mouth anymore?”Granny Zhou’s eyes lit up.

“Yes.”Ye Zao took a bite of the desserts. “I never lie.”

“Granny Zhou held ye Zao’s hand. “Zao Zao, if this prescription can really cure my diabetes, I will definitely thank you properly!”Granny Zhou had been afraid of her mouth for more than twenty years. She really wanted to eat and drink a lot in the following days, she ate and drank a lot. ”

“You’re welcome.”

“After chatting with ye Zao for a while, Granny Zhou looked at her watch and said, “Zao Zao, it’s getting late. I should go back now. Let’s chat again when we have time.” ”

“”Alright, take care.”Ye Zao stood up to send Granny Zhou off. ”

Granny Zhou smiled and waved her hand. “You don’t have to send me off.”

“After sending Granny Zhou off, ye Zao returned to the dessert area and continued eating dessert. ”

“”Ye Zao, right?” ”

“At this moment, an arrogant female voice appeared above his head. ”

Ye Zao looked up slightly.

Jiang Xiaoyu was stunned.

Holy shit!

So Beautiful!

“Although she was already very beautiful from afar, looking at her face-to-face, it made people’s eyes light up and they were unable to extricate themselves from it. ”

She was simply a beauty of the golden age!

“It’s me.”

“Ye Zhuo’s red lips parted slightly, and his tone was light. ”

Jiang Xiaoyu also reacted from this light voice. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

So what if she was beautiful?

Now it was all about inner beauty!

A person like Zhao Xueyin who was beautiful and kind-hearted was truly beautiful!

“It was truly a pity that she had such a good appearance. If this appearance had been on Zhao Xueyin’s face, she would have been able to lick it for the rest of her life. ”

Such a pity.

Such a pity.

“Jiang Xiaoyu continued, “Come out with me for a moment.” ”

“This was the venue of the banquet and many people knew her. If the old man in her family knew about this, she would be in deep trouble! ”

“Therefore, Jiang Xiaoyu decided to bring ye Zhuo out to teach him a lesson. ”
