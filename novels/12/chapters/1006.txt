“Chapter 1007: 226: The Truth of that year, the Real Half Moon was ye Shu! 2”

Translator: 549690339

“As Old Mrs. Cen walked, she told ye Shu about ye Langhua.”

“”When Little Langhua was young, she was a talented girl whose name shook the capital. In that era, she could be said to be truly glorious! She was good at everything, but her taste in men was not good...””

Old Lady Cen told the story that happened to Ye Langhua.

“Hearing this, Ye Shu also sighed endlessly.”

A talented woman of her generation had actually become like this.

Sigh!

“Other than sighing, she felt more heartache.”

How many thirty-six years could a woman have?

But Aunt Lang gave the best thirty-six years of her life to her daughter.

“So Auntie Lang has already found her daughter?”Ye Shu continued to ask.

“Old Mrs. Cen said, “That’s what they say, but I still think that the one that she found isn’t Little Half Moon! “With that Bastard XI Muwen, how could he be so kind? “I’m not slandering him! “Maybe he was the one who intentionally lost little half moon back then! “If Little Half Moon wasn’t lost, with Little Lang Hua’s methods, how could he turn the Ye group into Xi Group?””

Ye Shu sighed. “I hope Aunt Lang can see the reality soon and reunite with her daughter!”

“”Let’s go, let’s not talk about this anymore! Let’s Go Shopping!”Old Mrs. Cen held ye Shu’s arm. “I know a very good barbecue shop nearby. Let’s Go Eat Barbecue!””

“When she said the last sentence, stars were about to appear in old Mrs. Cen’s eyes.”

“Zhou Xiang had lost weight recently, so old Mrs. Cen’s blood pressure was on the high side. It had been a few days since she had seen meat on the Cen family’s dining table.”

“When she thought about how she would be able to eat delicious barbecue soon, old Mrs. Cen was beyond excited.”

On the other side.

Auntie Lang returned to the Xi family home.

“When she reached the door, she heard the sound of laughter coming from inside.”

“They were only separated by a door, but Auntie Lang felt like they were separated by a galaxy.”

They were just a family of four.

“Through the crack in the door, Aunt Lang looked at the scene inside with a self-deprecating look in her eyes.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“At this moment, Old Mrs. Cen’s words appeared in Aunt Lang’s ears again.”

“For a moment, Aunt Lang was stunned.”

“Aunt!”

“Just as Aunt Lang was stunned, Xi Weiyue opened the door and walked out. “Aunt, you’re back. We’re all waiting for you to have dinner!””

Aunty Lang smiled. “You guys can eat first. There’s no need to wait for me.”

“It’s more lively when there’s more people.”Xi Weiyue held Aunty Lang’s arm affectionately and the two of them walked into the house.

“XI weiyue continued, “Aunty, you’ll sit beside Sister Half Moon.””

This was to give Aunty Lang a chance to spend more time with half moon.

Aunty Lang looked at Xi Weiyue gratefully.

Xi Weiyue smiled at Auntie Lang. Her gaze seemed to be saying that they were a family.

Auntie Lang bent down and sat down.

“Just as she sat down, Little Half Moon, who had been sitting there, immediately hid behind Yang Jiao like a startled bird.”

“Seeing this scene, Auntie Lang’s eyes dimmed.”

“Yang jiao smiled and said, “This child, why are you hiding!””

“Little Half Moon pointed at Aunt Lang and said, “A bad person!””

A bad person.

“In the eyes of her biological daughter, she was a bad person.”

Perhaps this was retribution.

Retribution for losing her daughter.

Aunt Lang’s eyes that were already dim could not see any light at all.

“Yang Jiao continued, “She’s not a bad person, she’s your mother.””

Little Half Moon still hid behind Yang Jiao and did not dare to come out.

Aunt Lang stood up. “I’ll sit over there.”

Only when Aunt Lang walked over to Xi Weiyue’s side and sat down did Xiao Banyue dare to come out from behind Yang Jiao.

Xi Muwen turned to look at Aunt Lang. “The child still needs time. There are some things that can not be rushed.”

“MMM.”Aunt Lang nodded.

“After a meal, Aunt Lang ate like wax.”

“After the meal, Yang Jiao brought Xiao Banyue to wash up. Throughout the entire process, as Aunt Lang’s biological mother, she could only watch from the side.”

“After giving half a month a bath, Yang Jiao pushed the study door open. “Old Mu, I have something to tell you.””

Xi Muwen was in the study processing documents when Yang Jiao suddenly came in. He frowned unhappily. “How many times have I told you? You have to knock before entering the study!”

“”You’re the only one who cares!”Yang Jiao continued, “I have something serious to tell you.””

“What is it?”Xi Muwen raised his head to look at Yang Jiao and massaged his temples tiredly.

“”Something very important!”Yang Jiao walked over to the opposite side of the desk and sat down. “Old Mu, I suspect that crazy woman has returned to normal!””

“What do you mean?”Xi Muwen straightened his expression.

“Yang Jiao continued, “Don’t you think that crazy woman has been resisting ye Langhua on purpose for the past few days? Moreover, her eyes don’t look like the eyes of a crazy woman! If this continues, I’m afraid that she will fall out of our control.””
