Chapter 293: 102: a new Dark Horse in the face-smacking process! 2

“Do you know Dr. Gu de-ning?”

The smile on Su Zishan’s face froze when she heard gu de-ning’s name.

She regretted it very much.

She regretted it so much that her intestines turned green.

She wished she could strangle herself to death.

If she had not given this opportunity to Gu de-ning back then, she would be the one being chased by the reporters now.

And what about Gu Dening?

What right did gu dening have?

“Look! Doctor Gu is over there!”

Someone shouted from the crowd.

The reporters who were interviewing Su Zishan instantly ran far away.

Su Zishan’s expression became even uglier.

She was so angry that her entire body was trembling.

Her back was covered in a layer of cold sweat.

“Doctor Gu! Please wait!”

“Dr. Gu!”

Gu deling, who had just walked out of the conference room, was instantly surrounded by reporters.

“Hello, Dr. Gu! As a global YKA drug that has developed a cure for cancer, how do you feel about it? Have you encountered any difficulties in the process? Will the YKA drug be mass produced in the future?”

“Dr. GU, May I ask which school did you graduate from?”

“Doctor Gu, May I know how you discovered the cancer antibody?”

”...”

Gu decing smiled and looked at the camera, “First of all, I want to clarify a question through your media. I didn’t develop the YKA drug! “I’m not the first person to cure cancer in the country. I’m just a little luckier than others and participated in the process of developing the YKA Drug!”

As soon as he said that.

The reporters all looked at each other.

No one expected gu dening to say such a thing.

They also didn’t expect gu dening to not be the first person to cure cancer!

As soon as he said that, the reporters immediately asked, “Not you? Then who is the developer of Yka Medicine? Is He also a doctor from the first People’s Hospital of Yunjing City?”

GU dening continued, “The developer of Yka Medicine has the surname Ye. The initials of YKA medicine are taken from her surname. You can call her Miracle Doctor Ye! At the same time, Miracle Doctor Ye is also the first person in China to cure cancer!”

Miracle Doctor Ye?

Hearing this, the reporters’eyes were filled with excitement.

“Then can you tell us more about this Miracle Doctor Ye?”

Gu dening smiled and said, “I’m really sorry. Miracle Doctor Ye is a very low-key person. She doesn’t want to reveal her personal information. Please Don’t disturb her!”

No one expected that someone would reject such an honor!

After all, this was the first person to cure cancer.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The first person in the world!

The reporters were even more curious about this Miracle Doctor Ye.

The reporter then asked, “In that case, can you tell us the gender of this Miracle Doctor Ye?”

GU dening said, “Miracle Doctor Ye is a very beautiful local girl from Yunjing City.”

She had thought that Miracle Doctor Ye was a man.

She did not expect that Miracle Doctor Ye was also a woman.

The reporters wanted to ask about Miracle Doctor Ye’s situation, but gu dening did not reveal any more information about ye Zao, so the reporters could only ask other questions.

“Doctor Gu, since you participated in the development of YKA drug, does that mean that you have also mastered the method to cure cancer?”

Gu dening nodded. “Yes! Doctor Ye is the first person to cure cancer, and he is also my teacher! All the honors I have now were given to me by Doctor Ye! It was Doctor Ye who made me successful!”

Never Forget to dig a well when drinking water.

Gu dening was not the kind of person who was ungrateful.

She was really grateful to Ye Zhuo, if it were not for ye Zhuo.

She was still the ordinary doctor Gu.

“Then, other than you, are there any other doctors in the first People’s Hospital of Yunjing City who can cure cancer?”

“Not yet. I’m the only one who has been working with Miracle Doctor Ye,”gu dening said.

The reporter continued to ask, “Then why isn’t there anyone else working with Miracle Doctor Ye?”Was it because there was an inside story? Or did the director open a backdoor for Gu Dening?

This sentence was too informative.

“Because other than director Zhou and doctor Zhu, no one else believed that miracle doctor ye could cure cancer.”Gu Dening told the story in a concise and comprehensive manner, “From the initial doubt to the first patient recovering and leaving the hospital, Miracle Doctor Ye’s journey was really not easy!”

At that time, no one believed that ye Zao had the ability to cure cancer.

Walking in the hospital, no one knew how many people rolled their eyes at her.

But she still persevered.

Gu dening accompanied ye Zao all the way here, from the first experiment to the second experiment, then the third, fourth, and fifth experiment... ... In the eyes of outsiders, it might only be a short half a month, but only gu dening knew how difficult ye Zao’s journey was.
