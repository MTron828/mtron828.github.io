“Hearing this, Aunt Lang’s eyes suddenly lit up. She raised her head and looked at the person. “What did you say?” ”

“Cao Wei smiled and said, “I said I have news for half a month.” ”

“Really?”

Cao Wei didn’t say anything.

“Aunt Lang stood up and said, “Let’s go in and talk.” ”

Cao Wei followed Aunt Lang’s footsteps.

“Aunt Lang turned to look at Xiao Mei. “Put up the rest sign. We won’t be open for business in the afternoon. Go Tell Old Wang, Old Zhang, and Xiao Li to get off work.” ”

“Okay.”Xiao Mei nodded.

“After giving her instructions, Aunt Lang turned around and walked towards the main hall. ”

Cao Wei followed Aunt Lang’s footsteps.

This was Cao Wei’s first time entering the main hall. His gaze swept around the room.

“The interior of the room had an antique feel to it. There were carvings everywhere, as well as antique vases placed on the table. The only flaw was that there was actually a fake. ”

Cao Wei frowned without leaving a trace.

Aunt Lang poured a cup of tea for Cao Wei.

“Thank you.”

“Aunt Lang continued, “I won’t beat around the bush. You said that you had news about half a month ago. Is that true?” ”

“”Of course it’s true.”Cao Wei continued, “Otherwise, I wouldn’t have made this trip today.” ”

“Where is she?”Aunt Lang asked.

Cao Wei calmly picked up his cup and drank a mouthful of water. “Don’t be anxious. Allow me to drink a mouthful of water.”

Aunt Lang couldn’t wait any longer. She just looked at Cao Wei with an anxious look in her eyes.

“As a mother, she had waited for more than 30 years. ”

“Now that she had finally received news of half a month, she was both anxious and excited. ”

“In fact, over the past 30 years, she had heard about news of half a month countless times. ”

Unfortunately.

The people she found in the end were not half a month.

“Cao Wei kept his appetite in suspense before he put down his cup unhurriedly. “If you have found half a month this time, you can come back with me.” ”

“Hearing this, Aunt Lang’s expression darkened. ”

“Cao Wei continued, “It’s been more than 30 years. Have you still not let go of the knot in Your Heart?” ”

“Aunt Lang did not answer this question. Instead, she asked, “Where is half a month?” ”

“”To tell you the truth, I’ve only found some clues. I don’t know if that person is half a month.”Speaking up to this point, Cao Wei paused, then he said, “But I’m 50% sure that that person is little half moon.” ”

“Really?”Aunt Lang’s lips were trembling.

“”Really.”Cao Wei nodded with certainty. “If we really found little half moon, you can go back with us.” ”

“Okay.”

“After a long while, Aunt Lang nodded. ”

“Cao Wei smiled and said, “Then it’s a deal.” ”

“”As long as I can find Little Half Moon, I’m willing to do anything.”Aunt Lang continued, “By the way, can you tell me where Little Half Moon is now?” ” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Cao Wei continued, “I can’t tell you now, but don’t worry. If there’s any progress, I’ll inform you immediately.” Cao Wei said, “Take your medicine and take good care of your body now. Don’t let little half moon worry.” ”

Xiao Mei stood outside the door and listened to the conversation inside.

They had found little half moon.

Xi Weiyue would be very happy when she found out.

Xiao Mei immediately went outside the house and called Xi Weiyue. “Miss Weiyue.”

“”Xiao Mei, what’s wrong? Is There Something Wrong?”Xi Weiyue’s voice came from the other side. ”

“Xiao Mei continued, “Do you have time now? I have something important to tell you.” ”

The important thing that Xiao Mei was talking about was definitely about ye Langhua.

“Actually, this matter could be said over the phone. ”

“However, Xiao Mei did not want to say it over the phone. ”

“If she were to speak to XI weiyue face-to-face, Xi Weiyue would definitely give her some benefits. ”

“The bracelet that Xi Weiyue gave her last time, she had sold it for 25,000 yuan. ”

“If she were to say it over the phone, would she still receive good things from Xi Weiyue? ”

“Xi Weiyue was very generous. Perhaps this time, she would even receive a bracelet that was worth a lot. ”

“”Then, let’s meet at the meet cafe near half a month.”XI weiyue continued, “I happen to have something going on nearby.” ”

“Sure.”

Xiao Mei would change out of her work clothes and come to the cafe.

Xi Weiyue was already sitting in a conspicuous spot in the hall waiting for her.

“Miss Weiyue.”Xiao Mei jogged over.

“XI weiyue smiled and said, “Take a seat. I don’t know what you like to drink, so I just ordered two cups of coffee and snacks.” ”

“The encounter coffee shop was a high-end coffee shop. A cup of plain water was sold for more than ten Yuan per cup, not to mention coffee and snacks. ”
