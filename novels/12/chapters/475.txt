The rest was self-evident.

“Old Mrs. Lin continued, “I’ve already contacted the experts in country P and said that they will give the news in a few days. Anyway, I won’t let Qianhua suffer.” ”

“Hearing this, Aunt Zhang was confident. ”

Old Mrs. Lin was serious this time.

It seemed that it was only a few days before Feng Qianhua married into the Lin family.

On the other side.

Feng Qianhua returned to the Feng family.

“Just as she returned, she saw old madam Feng waiting for her at the door. ”

“When she saw old madam Feng, Feng Qianhua’s heart skipped a beat. ” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“As a mother, she had always seen only benefits. This time, there was definitely nothing good. ”

“Mother.”Feng Qianhua walked over.

Old Madam Feng smiled. “You’re back.”

“Mm.”Feng Qianhua nodded.

Old Madam Feng looked outside the door. “Did the Lin family’s chauffeur send you back?”

“Yes.”

“The expression on old madam Feng’s face softened a little, but her tone was still aggressive, “Qianhua, I know that old Madam Lin likes you very much and is very satisfied with you, but you won’t be able to get past Lin Jin city! I Can’t Let Old Lady Lin Marry You! I’ve waited for you for nineteen years, nineteen years, but you still haven’t married into the Lin family. Let me ask you, when will you be able to give me a definite letter?” ”

“It was said that the daughter who was married off would be splashed with water, but the Feng family had already raised Feng Qianhua and her daughter for so many years, yet they still hadn’t received any returns. ”

Old Madam Feng didn’t know when the splashed water would bring benefits to the Feng family!

“No later than this year.”Feng Qianhua’s tone was firm.

“Are you serious?”Old Madam Feng was in disbelief.

“I’m sure.”

Old Madam Feng glanced at Feng Qianhua. “I hope you won’t disappoint me this time.”

“Don’t worry.”

“After saying this, Feng Qianhua returned to her room. ”

Feng Xianxian was watching TV in the living room.

“Seeing this, Feng Qianhua frowned. “Xianxian, why didn’t you go to the body-building class?” ”

“In order to cultivate a refined temperament, Feng Xianxian not only learned Latin dance, but also signed up for a weekly body-building class. ”

“Feng Xianxian said, “Teacher has something to do today, so there’s no class today.” ”

“Feng Qianhua immediately turned off the TV. “Then go read a book, learn chess, and practice the way of tea! Mom is going to marry you into the Lin family soon. As the eldest daughter of the Lin family, you have to bring out the eldest daughter of the Lin family’s temperament.” ”

“I heard from your grandmother Lin that fifth master Cen likes to drink tea and play chess. You have to practice these two things well!”

“If she wanted to attract fifth master Cen’s attention, she had to cater to his interests. ”

“Although Feng Xianxian had studied the way of tea and chess since she was young, she was still a little immature in front of Fifth Master Cen. ”

“Hearing this, Feng Xianxian’s eyes lit up. “Mother, are you really going to marry into the Lin Family?” ”

“Yes.”Feng Qianhua nodded.

“In that case, she was about to become the legitimate eldest daughter of the Lin Family! ”

“Thinking of this, Feng Xianxian’s face was full of excitement. ”

“Thinking of the extremely noble fifth master Cen, Feng Xianxian felt her heart almost jump out of her chest. ”

Bang Bang Bang —

“Feng Qianhua continued, “By the way, Xianxian, from today onwards, you’ll be a vegetarian.” ”

“What? A vegetarian?”Feng Xianxian was stunned. “Mom! I’m Not Fat!”

“In order to maintain her weight, Feng Xianxian had already paid attention to her diet. If she were to eat a vegetarian diet and not touch any meat, who would be able to stand it? ”

“Feng Qianhua looked at Feng Xianxian. “Cen Wuye is a vegetarian. Before you follow me to the Lin family, you must change your eating habits.” ”

Fifth Master Cen is a vegetarian?

Upon hearing this sentence.

Feng Xianxian instantly had no objections.

“As long as she could marry fifth master Cen and stand at the top, she was willing to do anything! ”

“At that time, she would be the ruler of the four nine cities. ”

Didn’t these relatives of the Feng family feel that Feng Qianhua was unable to marry into the Lin family and usually ridiculed them?

She wanted to make those people in the Feng family who looked down on her regret beyond measure!

“Feng Xianxian nodded firmly. “Mom, I’ll listen to you.” ”

“Seeing her daughter so obedient and obedient, Feng Qianhua was also very gratified. ”

...

On the other side.

In the top-floor office of the CEN Group.

“Cen Shaoqing was sitting at his desk, brewing tea. ”

“On the jade green tea set, a pair of fair and slender hands weaved through it. When the tea set collided, it emitted a crisp ding dong sound. Tea smoke curled up, making that exquisite facial features even more hazy, as if it was covered with a layer of gauze. ”

“The man’s facial features were handsome. He wore a retro-styled long gown with a buttoned top. His eyes were slightly narrowed, and his thick eyelashes covered his bottomless eyes. The Red Mole at the end of his eyes only added to his charm. ”
