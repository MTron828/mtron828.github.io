“As soon as she said this, it was as if she had thrown a stone into a calm lake. Instantly, ripples spread in all directions. ”

“Bai Jingshu!”

“Bai Mo wanted to stand up, but she couldn’t muster the strength to do so. ”

“Bai Jingshu continued, “I’ve never done anything to you. This is all your own doing.” ” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“”You set me up?”Realizing this, Bai Mo’s eyes were filled with fear. ”

Bai Mo had never expected that she would hit herself in the foot.

“Although she did not want to admit it, her current symptoms were like she had been drugged. ”

“At this moment, Bai Mo was extremely flustered. ”

“Bai Jingshu continued, “Bai Mo, haven’t you realized your mistake yet? There’s no end to the suffering!” ”

“In fact, Bai Jingshu still hoped that Bai Mo would turn back in time. ”

She was still so young. There were endless possibilities for her future.

“In the next second, the door to the dressing room was pushed open again. ”

Bang.

A slender figure walked in from outside.

“”Sister-in-law, why are you being so polite to this kind of person?”A very clear voice asked. ”

“It was clearly a pleasant voice, but in Bai Mo’s ears, there was only endless panic. ”

It was ye Zao.

Bai Mo took a few steps back.

“In the end, she had underestimated ye Zao and Cen Shaoqing. ”

What should she do now?

“According to Ye Zao’s methods, she would probably end up in a miserable state, right? ”

Bai Mo’s body was trembling.

Bai Jingshu looked at Ye Zao. “Zao...”

“Ye Zao curled his lips slightly, but no expression could be seen on his face. He only said, “Sister-in-law, leave this person to me. You can go to the front hall!” ”

“To Bai Jingshu, Bai Mo was a scourge. ”

“If Bai Jingshu did not clean up Bai Mo, she would not be able to live a peaceful life in the future. ”

“Since she had interfered, she would definitely not leave any trouble for Bai Jingshu and Lin Ze. ”

“Bai Jingshu nodded. “Zao, then...” ”

“Bai Jingshu originally wanted to plead for Bai Mo, but on second thought, she felt that she did not know what was good for her. Bai Mo had already treated her like this, so there was no need for her to show mercy to Bai Mo.. ”

“”Zhuozhuo, I’ll have to Trouble You Then,”Bai Jingshu said. ”

Ye Zhuozhuo looked back slightly. “It’s nothing.”

“Soon, only ye Zhuozhuo and Bai Mo were left in the small makeup room. ”

The air was so oppressive that it was hard to breathe.

Bai Jingshu was feeling empty and afraid at the same time.

“”What... What do you want?”Bai Mo looked at Ye Zhuozhuo, his eyes filled with fear. ”

She did not understand why.

“Bai Jingshu was the one who had done something wrong, but everyone wanted to make things difficult for her. ”

She was only pursuing her own happiness. What was wrong with her?

But everyone was blaming her.

Including Lin Ze.

“Lin Ze liked her so much, but he refused to admit it. ”

Ye Zao reached out and snapped his fingers in front of Bai Mo..

Snap.

“The next second, Bai Mo closed her eyes and fell asleep. ”

“Today was the day of Lin Ze and Bai Jingshu’s wedding. Ye Zao did not want Bai Mo to ruin the good omen, so if there were things that could be handled outside, he would try his best to handle them outside. ”

“At this moment, ye Zao seemed to have thought of something. He straightened Bai Mo’s body and unbuttoned the first button on her shirt. Then, he took out a small dagger and gently slid it down Bai Mo’s neck and collarbone. ”

“In an instant, bright red blood oozed out from her skin. ”

“A moment later, she took out a transparent chip from Bai Mo’s wound. ”

“This chip was equivalent to an identity card in the S Galaxy. With it, one could freely enter and exit all parts of the s galaxy. At the same time, it also had the function of automatically connecting to the signal station in the s galaxy. ”

This was also the reason why Bai Mo could still communicate with Bai Yuanyuan in the s galaxy even when she was on Earth.

...

“When Bai Mo woke up again, she was surrounded by an unfamiliar environment. ”

She lay on a bed and stared at the surroundings for a long time before she realized that this was Liu Chao’s home.

Why was she at Liu Chao’s Home?

“Also, why couldn’t she move? ”

“Although she couldn’t move, she could feel that at this moment, she wasn’t naked. ”

What was wrong with her?

“Thinking about her experience at the wedding, Bai Mo broke out in a cold sweat. ”

She...

She wouldn’t...

Bai Mo didn’t even dare to think about the rest.

Creak.

“The next second, the door opened. ”

Liu Chao walked in from outside. “You’re awake.”

“Scram!”Bai Mo said angrily.

How could such a lowly person like Liu Chao see such a noble body of hers?

It was impossible.

“Liu Chao stood by the bed, his eyes full of ridicule. “Bai Mo, do you think you are still that high and mighty second miss of the Bai Family?” ”
