She recalled the days when she roamed with ye Zao.

“At that time, Ye Zao was the same age as her, but he was like a big sister, protecting her from everything. ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Of course, if I’m not powerful, who is?” ”

“”So, who is the real culprit behind the scenes?”Shi Qingcheng asked curiously. ”

“Ye Zhuo narrowed his eyes and continued, “Who benefits the most from Manwen’s imprisonment?” ”

“Manxing?”Shi Qingcheng asked incredulously.

“It’s her.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

Shi Qingcheng felt that her worldview had been refreshed. “But aren’t Manjiangshan and Zhao Dan her biological parents?”

She had never heard of such a thing in her entire life!

“”Man Xing is a very ambitious person. In order to achieve her goal, she will do anything.”Ye Zhuo continued, “The reason why man Wen has a reputation of being a hedonist is all thanks to her. If Man Wen’s will was a little weaker, he would really become a good-for-nothing hedonist!” ”

This was also one of the things that ye Zhuo admired about man Wen.

“A well-fed, pampered, well-fed life was really easy to cripple a person. ”

But Man Wen did not.

“Not only did he not, but he also learned how to hide and successfully deceived man Xing. ”

“”Oh my God!”Shi Qingcheng said in disbelief, “You mean, the reason why man Wen’s reputation is so bad is entirely because of man Xing?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“”Then man Wen is not easy,”shi qingcheng sighed, “He had a parent who favored his sister since he was young, and he was deliberately raised and crippled... Zao Zao, do you have evidence now? You must not let man Xing succeed!” ”

“”Don’t worry,”ye Zao said. ”

“On this side, Ye Han ran all the way to Granny Fei’s residence. ”

“Hearing the footsteps, Granny Fei, who had been taking a nap, slowly opened her eyes. She turned her head to look at the source of the sound and said with a smile, “Han Han is here.” ”

“Granny Fei.”

“Granny Fei slowly stood up from her rocking chair. “It was Zao Zao who asked you to come, right?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Han nodded.

“Granny fei smiled and said, “Follow me.” ”

Ye Han followed Granny Fei’s footsteps.

...

On the other side.

“Under the citizens’Bloody Letters, man Xing was ‘forced’to bring charges against man Wen, accusing him of hiring a murderer to kill. ”

“Facing Man Wen were two lives. Once convicted, he would be immediately hanged. ”

“Man Wen sat in the interrogation room, his face somewhat haggard. ”

He had never thought that man Xing would use this matter as an excuse.

Who was the murderer who hurt his parents?

Why did the smuggler who surrendered want to frame him?

Could it be...

“Thinking of this, Man Wen’s heart skipped a beat. ”

Could it be that man Xing had something to do with his parents’death?

“Although Man Wen hated man Xing, he still couldn’t face this fact. ”

“No matter how vicious man Xing was, he shouldn’t have made a move on man Jiangshan and Zhao Dan. ”

“After all, man Jiangshan and Zhao Dan were their biological parents. ”

“Man Wen knitted his brows tightly, and the expression on his face was a little unsightly. ”

“”Be lenient if you confess, but strict if you resist.”At this moment, the interrogator rudely picked up the lamp and shone it on man Wen’s face. “Yang Xiaowei has already confessed. You should confess earlier too! You Don’t have to suffer physical pain.” ”

The mood of the people was very high right now. They were all waiting for the police department to give an answer.

Man Wen’s thoughts were pulled back at this moment. He raised his head and looked at the interrogator. “I didn’t do those things.”

“”Didn’t do them?”The interrogator continued, “If you didn’t do them, would Yang Xiaowei give you up? If you didn’t do them, you would be caught! Everyone who came here said that they were wronged!” ”

“At this point, the interrogator took out a piece of paper. “I advise you not to delay any longer. Sign It quickly!” ”

“”If you didn’t do it, then you didn’t do it.”Man Wen waved the pen that the interrogator handed over. “Don’t you understand human language?” ”

Pa..

The pen fell to the ground with a crisp sound.

“The interrogator was furious. Just as he was about to punch man Wen, the door of the interrogation room was pushed open from outside. “Xiao Li.” ”

“What’s Wrong?”The interrogator looked up.

“Come here for a moment.”

The interrogator put down the light and walked over.

That person whispered a few words into the interrogator’s ear.

“Hearing that, the interrogator nodded. “Got it.” ”

“After saying that, that person turned around and left. ”

The interrogator returned to the room and looked at his two subordinates. “Send him to the small dark room first.”

“Yes.”

“Man Wen was lifted up from the left and right. The tip of his feet left the ground. In the next second, man Wen directly shook off the shackles of the two men. ”

“Let Go! I can walk on my own.”

“At this moment, Man Wen did not hide anything. His aura was fully unleashed, making people feel a little stunned. ”

The two guards did not dare to Touch Man Wen anymore. They just followed behind man Wen.

“The small black room was a completely sealed room. It was pitch-black and isolated from all sound from the outside world. If one’s mental endurance was not strong, one could make people surrender within an hour. ”

“However, a small dark room of this level was nothing to man Wen. ”

The things he had experienced when he was young were more than ten times darker than this one.

Man Wen squatted in a corner. The Darkness covered his expression.

...

On the other side.

In the office.

Man Xing turned to look at his assistant.

“How’s the matter going?”

“The assistant nodded and said, “Don’t worry, everything is ready.” ”

“Is there any movement on ye Zao’s side?”Man Xing asked.

The assistant shook his head. “Not yet.” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Man Xing was stunned. Things had developed to this point, but there was no movement from ye Zao at all. ”

This was a little strange.

“Logically speaking, ye Zao should have reacted. ”

“”What About Man Wen?”MAN XING continued, “Has man Wen confessed yet?” ”

“”Not yet.”The assistant continued, “But you don’t have to worry. With chief judge Li around, he has plenty of ways to get Manwen to confess.” ”

“Okay.”Man Xing nodded.

“She was not in a hurry about this matter. Now that all the evidence had been destroyed, could it be that ye Zao could still predict the future? ”

“”Continue to keep an eye on ye Zao’s side. If there are any problems, remember to report to me immediately.”Man Xing looked at the assistant. ”

“”Okay, don’t worry.” ”

Ye Zao must be very busy with the matter of man Wen. How could he be distracted to find the people she sent over?

This was only the beginning.

The fun was yet to come!

“She wanted ye Zao to watch in front of her. She, man Xing, could stand at the top without any help from anyone! ”
