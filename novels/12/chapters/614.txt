“Chapter 615: 147: publicly flaunting their love and envying others, the truth has surfaced! 1”

Translator: 549690339

“As soon as ye Zao finished speaking, the air turned silent.”

Those who were waiting to see ye Zao Make a fool of himself were also dumbfounded.

Cen Shaoqing?

CEN fifth master!

“Who would have thought that not only was ye Zao’s boyfriend not an old man, but he was the CEN fifth master that all the socialites in the capital wanted to marry!”

“Especially Feng Xianxian, the color on her face immediately disappeared.”

She could not believe it was real!

This blow was even greater than knowing that ye Zao was Dr. YC.

How could Cen Wuye Be Ye Zao’s boyfriend?

But the person in front of her was indeed Cen Shaoqing!

How could ye Zao be worthy of Cen Shaoqing?

“Moreover, ye Zao’s boyfriend should be that old man.”

He had already come to the school gate to pick up ye Zao twice.

Ye Zao also admitted that the old man was her boyfriend.

What was going on?

Feng Xianxian’s hand under the table was clenched into a fist.

She was clearly the person CEN fifth master liked.

Old Mrs. Cen was also very satisfied with her.

Why did Cen fifth master suddenly become ye Zao’s boyfriend?

Ye Zao!

Ye Zao must have seduced fifth Master CEN on purpose.

“After all, Ye Zao had a mistress’mother around.”

“Shameless, truly shameless.”

“Ever since ye Zao appeared in the capital, first he snatched away her position as the eldest daughter of the Lin family, and now even fifth master Cen was snatched away by Ye Zao!”

How could she endure this?

No Way!

She must snatch fifth master Cen Back!

Feng Xianxian tried her best to calm herself down.

“Feng Qianhua, who was beside her, was also stunned.”

It was as if she had split it. She had never thought that ye Zao’s boyfriend would be Cen Shaoqing.

Cen Shaoqing should be her son-in-law.

Old Lady Lin had also been trying to set Feng Xianxian and Cen Shaoqing up.

Why would cen Shaoqing get together with ye Zao?

She thought that she could use old lady Lin’s birthday banquet to chase ye Zao out of the Lin family.

“She did not expect that not only did she fail to chase ye Zao out, she even let ye Zao show off.”

This was CEN fifth master!

“Feng Qianhua squeezed Feng Xianxian’s hand and said in a low voice, “Act according to the circumstances.””

Feng Xianxian nodded.

“Since things had come to this point, she could only act according to the circumstances.”

“They could still get a divorce after getting married, not to mention that ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing had only just started.”

Cen Shaoqing was hers!

It could only be hers!

“Cen Shaoqing walked up to greet everyone. “Uncle, aunt, grandmother, first uncle, third uncle, fourth uncle, and aunt, second aunt, third aunt. Hello, I’m Cen Shaoqing, Zao Zhuo’s boyfriend.””

It wasn’t until Cen Shaoqing spoke again that everyone in the Lin family reacted.

“They looked at each other, their eyes filled with disbelief.”

Lin Jincheng’s heart skipped a beat.

Why was it Cen Shaoqing?

No wonder Cen Shaoqing came to the Lin family’s two banquets.

It wasn’t that Cen Shaoqing wasn’t outstanding.

It was that Cen Shaoqing was a little older.

He was 31 years old this year.

Ye Zhuo was only 19 years old. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

There was a difference of 11 years between them.

He had thought that ye Zhuo’s boyfriend was only two or three years older than ye Zhuo.

He had not expected that there would be a difference of 11 years.

This made Lin Jin Cheng find it hard to accept.

“Seeing that Lin Jin Cheng did not say anything for a long time, the Lin family’s eldest, Lin Qingfan, quickly stood up. “Fifth Master, please take a seat.””

“Cen Shao Qing was so frightened that he bowed. “Uncle, you’re too polite. I’m a junior. You can just call me little CEN.””

Little Cen.

“After all, this was fifth master Cen.”

“Even if Old Lady Lin and the Cen family’s old lady had some friendship, they usually didn’t dare to call Cen Shaoqing by his first name.”

“Even though Lin Qing had walked in the shopping mall for many years and had developed a body of iron and steel, he was still a little nervous in front of Cen Shaoqing. “Little, Little Cen.”He had never dreamed that.., that he would one day become CEN Shaoqing’s uncle.”

All of this was even more unreal than a dream.

“Ye Zhuo pulled Cen Shaoqing along and introduced him to his brothers from the Lin family. “This is my brother, Lin Ze.””

“Brother.”Cen Shaoqing followed behind and called him.

“He called him brother very naturally, as if he was really younger than Lin Ze.”

Lin Ze didn’t have a good impression of Cen Shaoqing.

“Cen Shaoqing had become famous too early and had a perverse personality. A few years ago, he was still unmarried. Why did he suddenly get together with ye Zao?”

“More importantly, Cen Shaoqing also had a serious tendency to violence.”

Cen Shaoqing might seem nice to ye Zao now.

“When a man was not married, he was as docile as a lamb. Once he got married, he would reveal his true colors.”

What if Cen Shaoqing Abused Ye Zhuo in the future?

Cen Shaoqing was 1.9 meters tall and was a martial artist.

“How could ye Zhuo, an unarmed weak woman, be his opponent?”
