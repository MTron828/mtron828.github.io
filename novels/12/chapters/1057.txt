Translator: 549690339

Zhao Pingting was panicking.

She had seen wrong!

She must have seen wrong! Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Ye Zhuo was so powerful, he definitely wouldn’t be caught by the Bald Man. ”

Zhao Pingting looked up again.

But the scene in front of her didn’t change.

It was ye Zhuo.

It was ye Zhuo.

“Burning burning...”

“The short-haired girl in the iron cage turned to look at Zhao Pingting and couldn’t help but ask in a low voice, “Do you know that girl?” ”

“Zhao Pingting’s breathing almost stopped. “She, she is my best friend!” ”

The short-haired girl was stunned.

“She had been locked in the basement for a long time, but this was the first time she had seen two good friends being dragged in at the same time. ”

“Zhao Pingting held the cage door tightly with both hands and said in a hoarse voice, “Zha Zha! Let Her Go! Bastard!” ”

Bang Bang Bang —

“Zhao Pingting smashed the cage loudly, trying to attract the bald man’s attention. ”

“No matter what, she could not let ye Zha suffer any harm. ”

“Seeing Zhao pingting like this, the short-haired girl beside her jumped in fright and said in a low voice, “Hey! You Don’t want to live anymore! Stop!” ”

Zhao Pingting’s actions had indeed attracted the Bald Man’s attention.

The Bald Man took off his hat and glasses and looked over.

His gaze was vicious.

“”B * Tch! You Want to die, right? If you want to die, I’ll Grant You Your Wish!” ”

“At the same time, Ye Zhuo also looked over. ”

When he looked over.

She was immediately stunned and a cold aura rose from her body.

That was Zhao Pingting.

“In just a day and a night, Zhao Pingting had already been tortured beyond recognition. ”

She was covered in blood.

Her hair was disheveled and her face was dirty.

Ye Zao pinched his fingers. His jade-like features seemed to be covered in a layer of snow.

The bald man grabbed the steel pipe on the side and walked towards Zhao Pingting.

The short-haired girl looked at the Bald Man in horror.

She had stayed in the basement for a long time and had seen the Bald Man kill people with her own eyes.

It was obvious that he had the intention to kill.

The bald man walked to Zhao Pingting with a steel pipe in his hand.

Crack —

The lock on the steel cage was broken at that moment.

The bald man suddenly swung the steel pipe and smashed it on Zhao Pingting’s head.

Zhao Pingting was so scared that she closed her eyes.

The short-haired girl covered her mouth with her hands and her eyes were filled with fear.

“At that moment, the short-haired girl saw a slender figure walking towards her. ”

“Many years later, the short-haired girl still remembered this scene clearly. ”

It was as if the girl had descended from the sky. She wore a black windbreaker and a pair of Martin boots of the same color.

It was cold and rustling.

Tap Tap Tap —

The sound of footsteps echoed in the damp basement.

“Just as the Bald Man was about to smash down with the steel pipe, someone patted his shoulder lightly. ”

The bald man narrowed his eyes and turned around in confusion.

“With one look, he saw a picturesque face. ”

He was quite bold

He liked bold people.

It seemed that this girl couldn’t wait to get his love.

“Thinking of this, a lewd smile appeared at the corner of the Bald Man’s mouth. He threw the steel pipe on the ground and reached out his hand to ye Zao. His eyes were full of lewd light. “Little beauty, are you already impatient?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zao’s lips curled slightly. “Already impatient...”

“Just as the Bald Man’s hand was about to touch ye Zao’s face, ye Zao gently raised his hand. ”

Just as the bald man had yet to react.

The next second.

Crack!

The clear sound of bones breaking suddenly sounded in the air.

No one saw how ye Zao attacked. They only saw that the bald man was stepped on the ground by ye Zao.

Even the bald man himself did not expect ye Zao to have such skill.

He was careless!

He was careless!

“The bald man put his hands on the ground and tried to get up. However, the feet that stepped on him seemed to weigh a thousand pounds. He could not move at all. ”

This scene stunned the women locked in the cage.

They thought that ye Zao was the prey that the bald man caught. They did not expect ye Zao to be so powerful!

At this moment.

Ye Zao was like sunlight shining into the darkness.

It was dazzling!

“At this moment, ye Zao let go of the foot that was stepping on the Bald Man’s body. Taking advantage of this opportunity, the bald man quickly stood up from the ground and picked up the axe on the ground and smashed it at Ye Zao’s face. ”

“Under the dim yellow light, the sharp blade of the axe shone with a cold and gloomy light. ”

“If this axe came down, they would lose their lives! ”

“Be careful!”

Zhao pingting shouted.

The women who were locked in the iron cage were also shocked.

Ye Zao’s appearance made them see the light and brightness that they had not seen for a long time.

But now...

Was this light and brightness going to disappear so soon?
