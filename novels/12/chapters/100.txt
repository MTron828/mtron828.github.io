Chapter 101: 075: dinner, thousands of miles to thank you! 1

The dim light shone on her face, coating it with a thin layer of light.

It was as clear as jade.

Lin Ze did not expect her to be a girl about his age.

In Lin Ze’s impression, little girls were usually delicate and weak.

A girl actually had such quick reactions.

It was somewhat impressive.

After a while, Lin Ze finally reacted and pulled his hand back.

At this moment, a young woman ran over from not far away. She was wearing a beige down jacket. “Zao Zao, What’s Wrong?”

Ye Zao looked back slightly and looked at Lin Sha. “Nothing.”

After saying that, Ye Zao looked at Lin Ze. “How are you?”

“I’m fine too.”Lin Ze shook his head slightly.

“That’s good.”Ye Zao smiled. After hearing Lin ze say that he was fine, ye Zao followed Lin Sha and left.

Lin Ze looked at the backs of the two of them and was stunned for a moment.

Moreover, this was a stranger that he had never seen before.

However, Lin Ze felt an inexplicable sense of affinity from her.

It was as if they had known each other for a long time.

It was a very strange feeling.

Could it be an illusion?

Lin Ze just looked ahead until the two figures completely disappeared into the crowd. He did not come back to his senses.

“Brother Ze! What are you looking at?”Li Wen walked over and patted Lin Ze’s shoulder.

Only then did Lin ze come back to his senses. “AH? Nothing!”

Li Wen curiously looked in the direction that Lin Ze had just looked. He did not see anything special, so he did not think too much about it.

“Let’s Go, brother Ze! Let’s go drink!” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Lin Ze followed Li Wen’s footsteps.

Lin Ze had a lot of alcohol in his heart, so he was a little tipsy.

They were all 18-year-old teenagers, and their upbringing was very strict. They were so drunk that they naturally couldn’t go home.

It just so happened that Buttface’s parents were on a business trip, so the three of them discussed going to Buttface’s house.

Tomorrow was Saturday, so they didn’t have to worry about going to school.

They went to Buttface’s house, took a shower, and squeezed all of them into one bed. Soon, they fell asleep.

When Lin Ze woke up, the snow outside had stopped. The sunlight shone in through the window, and it was a bit dazzling.

The snoring sounds in the house were one after another.

The snoring sounds of the 18-year-old boy were getting louder and louder.

Lin Ze picked up his phone and took a look.

It was already 10:30 am.

Dog two had already woken up. Only He, fat tiger, and Zhao Wen were still asleep.

Lin Ze pinched his temples, lifted the blanket, and went to the bathroom to wash up.

He had been to dog two’s house many times and was very familiar with it.

After washing up, dog two came in from outside. As it took off its hat, it said, “Brother ZE is awake! I bought breakfast. Are Fat Tiger and Mozzie still asleep?”

Lin Ze nodded.

“I’ll go wake them up.”Buttface placed the food on the table and ridiculed, “You really can sleep! You’ve been sleeping since 11 o’clock last night. Are you pigs reincarnated?”

Buttface lifted the duvet and opened the window.

A cold wind blew in from the window, freezing the two people on the bed. They quickly woke up. “Damn, it’s so cold! Mom, what are you doing so early in the morning?”

Dog two smiled and said, “Mozzie, take a good look at who I am. Also, it’s almost 11 o’clock in the morning!”

Only then did Li Wen wake up.

Dog Two threw the laundry to them. “Get up quickly! Brother ZE is waiting for you to eat outside!”

Li Wen reluctantly put on his clothes.

Fat Tiger said as he put on his clothes, “Did you buy my favorite meat buns?”

“Yes.”Buttface nodded. “Hurry up, it’s almost time for lunch.”

Among the four boys, Buttface was a good wife and mother. No matter what time it was, he could handle the trivial matters in an orderly manner and take good care of the other three.

Li Wen was a life mentor. Although his academic results were not good, he was especially outstanding in the aspect of dealing with people.

Fat Tiger was the simple-minded type. He didn’t care about anything. Whatever the other three did, he would do.

Lin Ze was the dull type. He rarely spoke, but he was a man of his words.

The boy washed up very quickly. In less than ten minutes, the two appeared in the living room refreshed and began to eat breakfast.

At this moment, an urgent phone rang in the air.

Lin Ze put down the half-eaten steamed bun and picked up the phone.

He didn’t know what was said on the other end of the phone, but Lin ze said “Okay”and put down the phone. He looked up at dog two. “Where’s your computer? Lend it to me.”
