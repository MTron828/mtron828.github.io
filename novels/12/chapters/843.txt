“Chapter 844: 185: I’ll break your leg. If my granddaughter-in-law isn’t good, who is? 2”

“At that time, Old Mrs. Cen will definitely regret it! ”

Old Mrs. Cen looked at Cen Yuyan. “I don’t have a granddaughter as stupid as you.”

Stupid?

Who is the stupid one?

“Cen Yuyan was holding a ball of fire in her heart as she held old Mrs. Cen’s hand, she said with a lie, “Grandma, I know that you have a sharp tongue but a soft heart. Although You Say So, you love me in Your Heart.”Old Mrs. Cen was the core figure of the CEN family. ”

“Cen Yuyan was a sensible person. She knew that she couldn’t offend Old Mrs. Cen now, so she could only swallow her anger and suck up to old Mrs. Cen. ”

“Thinking that old Mrs. Cen would soon see the truth, CEN Yuyan felt a lot better. ”

Old Mrs. Cen pulled her hand back and looked at Cen Yuyan with a strange look. She narrowed her eyes.

“Cen Yuyan continued, “Grandma, I have something to discuss with you.” ”

“Speak.”

“Cen Yuyan considered her words in her heart and continued, “Grandma, the place where Chenyu lives has been discovered by the illegitimate rice these few days. So, I want Chenyu to move in with us for a few days. What do you think?” ”

Celebrities were most afraid of illegitimate rice.

Song Chenyu had been very distressed these few days.

“Therefore, Cen Yuyan had asked Song Chenyu to move into the Cen family manor. ”

“The Cen family manor was not an ordinary manor. The security was top-notch, and ordinary people could not enter. ”

“When song Chenyu moved here, not only could he avoid the disturbance of the illegitimate rice, but he could also have the opportunity to be alone with Cen Shaoqing. ”

It was killing two birds with one stone.

“Old Mrs. Cen looked at Cen Yuyan. “I advise you not to have such thoughts, because it will affect your height.” ”

“Why will it affect your height?”Cen Yuyan’s face was full of question marks.

“Old Mrs. Cen picked up the walking stick at the side. “Because I will break your legs. If you don’t believe me, you can try.” ”

“Cen Yuyan was somewhat unwilling. “Grandma, please let Chenyu move in. Our family has so many rooms. Are we afraid of having one more person living in it?” ”

“”When I say no, I mean no.”Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Let song Chenyu move in and your legs. You Choose.” ”

“”Grandma, do you really want to break my legs?” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen did not have a smile on her face. “If you dare to let song Chenyu live here, I will break your legs. If you really break them, I will support you for the rest of your life!” ”

Cen Yuyan’s heart trembled when she heard that.

She could feel that old Mrs. Cen was not joking with her.

“Cen Yuyan swallowed her throat. “Grandma, I know that you have the heart of a bodhisattva. Chenyu is a girl, how pitiful it is to be alone outside! Now that she is being targeted by an illegitimate child, please help her!” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen glanced at Cen Yuyan and began to tidy up the paintings on the table, no longer paying attention to CEN Yuyan. ”

“Cen Yuyan continued, “Grandma, I’m begging you, okay?” ”

The old Mrs. Cen in the past was not like this at all.

“In Cen Yuyan’s eyes, Old Mrs. Cen had always been a very caring person. ”

“If this were in the past, old Mrs. Cen would definitely have agreed to let song Chenyu stay at the Cen family. ”

She seemed to have changed into a different person.

She had no compassion.

When did old Mrs. Cen become like this?

It started when she met ye Zao.

“When she thought of this, Cen Yuyan’s expression changed. ”

Ye Zao.

“It was all ye Zao’s fault. If it weren’t for Ye Zao, Song Chenyu would definitely have been able to smoothly stay at the CEN residence. ”

“After meeting ye Zao, Old Mrs. Cen began to be blind. ”

Song Chenyu was clearly such a good daughter of the nation.

“However, old Mrs. Cen just couldn’t see Song Chenyu. She even had an inexplicable dislike for song Chenyu. ”

“”Grandma!”Cen Yuyan wasn’t willing to give up just like that. She grabbed old Mrs. Cen’s arm, “Grandma, I’ve never begged you for anything. This time, can you treat it as I’m begging you? Just let Chenyu stay at home for a period of time. After she settles the matter of the illegitimate rice, she will move out.” ”

“Don’t say anymore. This is impossible.”

“After saying that, old Mrs. Cen brought the painting upstairs. ”

“Cen Yuyan looked at Old Mrs. Cen’s back view and was so angry that she gritted her teeth. She turned to Zhou Xiang and said, “Mom, please help me plead with Grandma! Don’t you like Chenyu the most?” ”

Song Chenyu was Zhou Xiang’s idol.

Song Chenyu was the star of one of Zhou Xiang’s favorite television dramas in ancient times.

“Zhou Xiang said with some embarrassment, “If your grandmother doesn’t agree, there’s nothing I can do.” ”

“”Mom!”CEN Yuyan continued, “Are you willing to watch Chenyu be disturbed by the illegitimate food? Mom, please help Chenyu!” ”
