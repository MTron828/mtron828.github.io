Ye Zao was not surprised to hear er Mao’s words.

“Looks come from the heart. Ye Zao did not like Zhang Qingqing very much at first glance. Moreover, her judgment was never wrong. ”

“Although he did not check Zhang Qingqing’s pulse, ye Zao could tell that her stomach was definitely more than a month old from her body shape and complexion ”

“Other than checking her pulse, traditional Chinese medicine emphasized on ‘looking, smelling, asking, and cutting.’ ”

“Putting aside asking and cutting, he could tell with just looking and smelling. ”

“Are there any photos and videos of her being a mistress?”Ye Zhuo continued to ask.

“To deal with a person like Zhang Qingqing, he still needed to use real evidence. Otherwise, she would be like a weed, endlessly stirring up new life when the Spring Breeze Blew! ”

One had to use evidence to directly hammer her to death.

“Er Mao said, “There isn’t any for the time being. If you want, I can help you check it out.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “Then I’ll have to trouble you.”

“”Of course.”Er Mao continued, “Then I won’t bother you anymore. I’ll call you after I’ve checked everything out.” ”

“”Okay.”Ye Zhuo was about to say yes when he seemed to have thought of something. He continued, “There’s one more thing. Help me check it out.” ”

“”Go ahead, Boss,”er Mao said. ”

“Ye Zao said, “Help me find out what happened to Zhang Qingqing at the Phoenix Union on the 8th of last month.” ”

It was not enough to just find out that Zhang Qingqing had been kept by someone. He had to give Lin Ze Justice.

Ye Zao had a premonition that Zhang Qingqing must have something else in her hands.

“Now that the public opinion on the internet was so big, if Zhang Qingqing were to bite back, it would be difficult to handle the matter. ” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Before exposing these things, they had to nip all the possibilities in the bud, leaving Zhang Qingqing helpless. ”

“”Alright boss, I will definitely investigate it thoroughly for you.” ”

“Thank you for your hard work.”

“It’s my pleasure.”

Er Mao hung up the phone.

“Just as he hung up the phone, eighty hair came over and asked, “Er Mao, why do you think the boss suddenly wants to investigate an ordinary person?” ”

“At first, he thought that Zhang Qingqing was some hidden big boss with other identities. ”

He didn’t expect that Zhang Qingqing was really ordinary and even became the mistress of a person who could be her father.

Er Mao narrowed his eyes. “It might be related to Lin Ze.”

“Who is Lin Ze?”Eighty hair asked curiously.

“Er Mao explained, “Lin Ze is the son of the head of the Lin family in Beijing.” ”

“The Lin Family? Is that the Lin Family?”Eighty hair asked.

“”Yes,”twenty hair asked. ”

Eighty hair touched his chin. “Could it be that the big boss has some relationship with the young master of the Lin Family?”

Twenty hair shook his head. “I’m not too sure about that.”

“Eighty Hair’s mind was blown. He continued, “I heard that the Lin family has a young miss. Do you think the Big Boss is the young miss of the Lin Family?” ”

Eighty hair and twenty hair were both Internet hackers. They only knew ye Zao’s code name and did not know ye Zao’s real identity.

“Twenty hair chuckled, “Those young misses are all pampered and pampered. I reckon that they don’t even know how to make Excel forms, let alone hacking skills!” ”

“The young misses of the wealthy families paid more attention to etiquette, music, chess, calligraphy, painting, flower arranging, and other subjects. How many young misses of the wealthy families were proficient in computers? ”

“That’s hard to say. What if it is!”Eighty hair said.

“”Stop Dreaming!”Er Mao patted eighty hair’s head, “I saw the Lin family’s eldest daughter on a variety show before. She was extremely beautiful! Have you heard of what a Useless Beauty Is? “When God opens a door for you, he will close a window for you. In this world, how can there be a perfect person!” ”

Er Mao had never associated z with ye Zao before.

“Ye Zao’s looks could not be found in all of China, let alone in the entertainment industry. ”

“Z’s hacking skills were the same. Her hacking skills could not be compared to hers, let alone China. Even if she was found, no one could compete with her! ”

“In this world, how could there be such a beautiful person with good hacking skills! ”

It was impossible!

“Eighty hair nodded. “You’re right! A smart woman won’t be too beautiful, and a beautiful woman won’t be too smart!” ”

“Er Mao turned on the computer. “So, don’t overthink it!” ”

“Eighty hair was still a little puzzled. “But if the big boss has nothing to do with Miss Ye, then what’s going on with Lin Ze?” ”

“”Maybe he knows Lin Ze!”Twenty hair continued, “This is the big boss’s private life, so let’s not bother about it! Just finish what the Big Boss gave us!” ”
