“Chapter 1267: 268: China, Ye Zao! 2”

No.

This matter must not be investigated by the police.

“Moreover, this matter could not be entirely blamed on him. ”

He also did not know that Ye Sen was his own flesh and blood.

“If he knew, he definitely would not do that. ”

Father Zhao was very regretful.

But it was no use regretting now!

He had to think of a way to save and get rid of the suspicion.

Thinking about it.

“Father Zhao immediately stood up from the ground and grabbed the leading policeman’s hand, preempting the attack, “”Comrade officers, I beg you to get justice for my son, to find out who is behind this, and if you can find out who is behind this, I will do whatever you want me to do! My Son is so pitiful, he lost his parents when he was young, and now he almost lost his life... . .”” ”

“In the end, Zhao’s father directly wailed out. ”

Just like a loving father.

“Who would have thought, looking at him, that he was the mastermind! ”

“Captain Li said, “”Sir, don’t worry. It is the duty of the police to fight against criminals and protect the lives and property of citizens. We will catch the criminals as soon as possible and punish them severely!”” ”

“Hearing the last two sentences, Father Zhao’s eyebrows jumped. ”

Punish them severely!

“Father Zhao gulped and continued, “”Have you found out anything? who exactly wanted to harm my son? I will definitely not forgive him!”” ”

“Captain Li continued, “”We can not reveal too much specific information to you, but don’t worry. Once there is any new information, we will definitely inform the family.”” ”

Can’t divulge too much specific information?

What did this mean?

Did the police find anything? VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Logically speaking, they shouldn’t be able to find anything. ”

“After all, Mike wasn’t an ordinary assassin. ”

“He had cooperated with Mike so many times, but Mike had never failed before. How could he be found out this time? ”

It was chaotic when he was concerned.

“Because ye Sen was his biological son, the more anxious he was, the more chaotic it became. ”

No.

He could not be anxious.

Father Zhao tried his best to calm himself down.

“””Okay, okay!””Father Zhao continued, “”Comrade police officers, it’s been hard on You! If you find anything, please inform me immediately.”” ”

“Captain Li looked at Father Zhao. “”It’s not hard at all. This is what we should do.”” ”

Ye Zhuo’s gaze inadvertently swept across Father Zhao’s face.

His expression was indifferent.

“Captain Li then walked to the side of Ye Sen’s bed and bent slightly. He looked at ye Sen and asked, “”Mr. Ye, how do you feel now?”” ”

“””Pretty good.””Ye Sen nodded. ”

“Captain Li then asked, “”Then is it convenient for me to ask you a few questions?”” ”

“””Sure.”” ”

“Captain Li turned to look at the other people in the ward. “”I want to ask the victim a few questions now. Please excuse us for a moment.”” ”

“””Okay.”” ”

Everyone walked out of the ward.

Father Zhao walked at the back.

“As he walked out, he turned around to look at the ward. ”

He felt uneasy.

“Not long after, Father Zhao came to the bathroom and made another call. ”

“When Mike saw Father Zhao’s call, his line of sight was cut off. ”

“However, Father Zhao was an old customer after all. There was still hope for cooperation in the future. Moreover, Father Zhao was generous and never defaulted on his commission. He picked up the call. “”Mr. Zhao.”” ”

“””M-mike!””Father Zhao’s voice was a little shaky. “”I’ve asked someone to book a plane ticket for you. Hurry up and leave China. Go out and lay low!”” ”

“On the other side, Mike was stunned. Even the cigarette between his fingers had burned his skin. He was completely unaware and asked with some uncertainty, “”Ye Sen has already woken up?”” ”

“””Yes!””Father Zhao continued, “”My son has already woken up! So you should hurry up and run! I can only say that my son’s Ye Zhuo is really not an ordinary person! If you don’t leave, she will definitely find out about you! At that time, we will all be finished!”” ”

Mike narrowed his eyes.

His eyes were filled with disbelief.

It was unbelievable.

It was simply unbelievable.

He did not expect that someone in a small country like China could actually cure his poison.

“After all, using poison was his specialty. ”

“Moreover, even he himself couldn’t cure his poison. How could a Chinese cure it? ”

“””Are you sure that your son has woken up?””Mike continued to ask. ”

“””Yes, I’m sure!””Father Zhao covered his mouth and said in a low voice, “”The police are already here! You should leave quickly!”” ”

“Mike said again, “”How is his mental state?”” ”

“””Very good!”” ”

Mike frowned deeply.

How could this be?
