“Therefore, when the two sisters went out together, they were often misunderstood as mother and daughter. ”

“Ye Sen was also embarrassed. “Sister, I’m sorry. I was blind!” ”

“It’s okay.”Gu Dexin waved her hand carelessly.

“Gu delin continued to introduce, “Sister, this is Miracle Doctor Ye’s uncle, Ye Sen.” ”

“Hearing this, Gu Dexin’s eyes lit up. “So You’re Mr. Ye! I’ve often heard about you from Dening!” ”

Gu dening often mentioned him in front of her family?

“Ye Sen glanced at gu dening and said, “Sister, you’re too kind! Just Call Me Xiao Ye!” ”

“”Then I won’t stand on ceremony.”GU dexin continued, “Xiao Ye, do you have a girlfriend?” ”

“”Not yet,”ye Sen answered. ”

“Gu dexin smiled and said, “It just so happens that our dening is still single! My parents are so worried about her, how about...” ”

“Gu dening quickly interrupted gu dexin, “Sister, the wind outside is quite strong, let’s go back quickly! Brother Ye, we’ll leave First!” ”

“After saying that, Gu dening pushed the wheelchair and turned to run. ”

Ye Sen smiled as he watched her back.

Gu Dening’s heart was still beating fast as she ran all the way to the ward.

Gu Dexin was a little speechless. “I’m talking to that Mr. Ye! Why are you running away!”

The Gu family’s parents were already over 90 years old.

Their only wish now was to see Gu dening hurry up and get married.

“Gu dening glanced at Gu Dexin. “Sister, who talks about that kind of topic on their first meeting! Besides, it’s not like your sister can’t Get Married!” ”

“”If you could get married, would you wait until now?”Gu Dexin asked back. ”

Gu Dening:”...”she was speechless.

Over here.

“After gu dening left, Ye Sen was ready to return to the ward. ”

“On the stone path, a doctor in a white coat brushed past him. ”

A moment later.

“The doctor in a white coat came back and looked at Ye Sen with disbelief in his eyes. “Ye, you, you’re Ye Sen?” ”

Ye Sen was actually fine?

“This was not an illusion, right! ”

Ye Sen nodded. “I’m Ye Sen. May I know if we know each other?”

The doctor in the white coat was doctor Li.

He did not expect ye Sen to wake up.

He also did not expect ye Sen to recover so quickly.

It was as if he was dreaming.

Doctor Li bit the tip of his tongue.

It hurt.

It was not a dream.

Ye Sen was really fine.

Could it be that it was a flash in the pan?

“Doctor Li continued, “Mr. Ye, I am your previous attending physician. My surname is Li! Can you come with me to my office? I want to give you a checkup!” ”

“Sure.”Ye Sen nodded and followed doctor Li to his office.

“After a checkup, doctor Li was completely stunned. ”

He was fine.

Ye Sen was actually fine.

Doctor Li thought that Ye Sen was already in a state of helplessness.

He did not expect ye Zao to Really Cure ye Sen.

Miracle!

This was simply a miracle.

“Seeing doctor Li like this, Ye Sen asked in puzzlement, “Doctor Li, What’s wrong? is my condition not too good?” ”

“”No! Your condition is very good!”Doctor Li continued, “I’m too surprised!” ”

“What are you surprised about?”Ye Sen asked.

“Doctor Li continued, “You may not know this, but your injury was very serious at that time. We gave you two critical notices. I, I even suggested pulling out the oxygen tube. It was your niece, Miracle Doctor Ye, who insisted on operating on you. That was why...”. “...”. The rest of his words.., were already self-evident. ”

Doctor Li’s feelings were very complicated now.

“At that time, because he did not believe that ye Zao would only have ye Sen, he even thought that ye Zao was experimenting on Ye Sen, so his attitude was not good. ”

“Thinking about it now, he was like a clown! ”

“Ye Sen smiled and said, “My niece is very powerful. She can even cure cancer, not to mention a small injury like mine!” ”

“After saying that, ye sen continued, “That doctor Li, if there’s nothing else, I’ll take my leave First!” ”

Doctor Li personally sent ye Sen out.

“When they returned to the ward, Lin Ze had already brought dinner. “Uncle, it’s time to eat.” ”

“Have you eaten?”Ye Sen asked.

“Lin Ze shook his head. “No, let’s eat together.” ”

Ye Sen looked inside the ward. “Where’s zhongruo?”

“I have something to do!”Lin Ze said.

“Ye Sen smiled and said, “Then let’s sit down and eat.” ”

There was a knock on the ward door.

Lin Ze walked over to open the door.

It was Father Zhao.

“When he saw Father Zhao, Lin Ze’s expression turned a little ugly. ”

“Father Zhao smiled and said, “Ah Ze, I’m here to bring your uncle some food.” ”
