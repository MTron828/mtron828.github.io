Translator: 549690339

Old Mrs. Cen looked at Cen Shaoqing with a face full of question marks. “So you’re saying that Yezi isn’t pregnant at all? !”

“”No, you’re thinking too much.”Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips opened slightly.”

Old Mrs. Cen’s face was full of disappointment. Why wasn’t she pregnant?

It seemed that Cen Shaoqing only wanted to make a dessert for ye Zhuo.

To think that she had imagined so much.

She had even thought of what clothes her future great-grandson and great-granddaughter would wear!

It was simply a waste of her imagination.

Old Mrs. Cen turned around and left.

“Even when she was about to leave, she did not forget to take away the bird’s nest on the table.”

“Seeing that old Mrs. Cen had returned with the bird’s nest and the servant responsible for taking care of old Mrs. Cen, ah XI said, “Old Mrs. Cen, didn’t you say that you wanted to nourish fifth master’s body? Why did you bring it back again?””

“”I didn’t even use all my strength to get down to business. What’s there to get up to!”Old madam CEN continued, “That damned brat has grown a body full of muscles for nothing.””

Business?

What was business?

“Although Ah Xi was quite curious, he did not ask further.”

On the other side.

“Seeing that Cen Shaoqing did not reply for a long time, Ye Zhuo made a call. “Cen Shaoqing.””

“Leader.”His deep voice sounded a little lazy.

“Ye Zao continued, “How is it? Is Grandma Okay?””

“Although old Madam Cen did not have any signs of Alzheimer’s disease, Ye Zao was still quite worried that Cen Shaoqing did not reply.”

“I’m fine. I was just making a big fuss over nothing.”

“”It’s good that you’re fine.”Ye Zao turned on the computer with one hand. “How’s the research on that heart-shaped candy, Mu Xue?””

“It’s still not ready yet.”Cen Shaoqing looked at the dessert that was being baked in the oven.

It’s almost ready?

The pastry chef at the side was stunned when he heard this.

“You’ve already used more than ten kilograms of raw materials, and this is called almost ready?” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Ye Zao naturally didn’t know about the situation here. He continued, “Call me when you’re done with your research.””

“Okay.”

“After hanging up the phone, ye Zao put his phone aside and continued to operate the computer.”

“The screen was filled with code that the layman could not understand. In a flash, the code was converted into the design of a huge space carrier.”

Ye Zhuo picked up the exclusive base communicator. “Cen Jiang.”

“”Miss Ye, I’m here.”Soon, Cen Jiang’s voice came from the other end.”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “You guys have been working on Area C these past few days?””

“”Yes,”Cen Jiang said.”

“Ye Zhuo clicked the mouse, and the computer screen immediately switched to the monitoring of the base. “Turn around and look to the right.””

Cen Jiang immediately turned around.

“Do you see the propeller on the left wing?”

“Yes.”Cen Jiang pressed the communicator. “Is there any problem with the propeller?”

“Ye Zhuo said, “If the quality is not up to standard, destroy the heavy equipment. Punish the Quality Inspection Department for a month’s salary. Submit a 3,000-word review report.””

An aircraft carrier was meant to fly in the sky.

“If there was a problem on land, it could still be fixed. But if there was a problem in the air, the consequences would be unimaginable.”

“Cen Jiang walked over and looked at the propeller. “Miss Ye, are you mistaken? There is no problem with the propeller.””

“”Some problems can not be seen with the naked eye. You will know once you test it.”Ye Zao’s voice was a little cold, “At a height of more than 10,000 meters, anything can become a deadly weapon. Therefore, we can’t afford to be careless in our work!””

“Cen Jiang said, “Don’t worry, Miss Ye. I’ll bring it over for testing right away.””

“After cutting off the communication, Cen Jiang immediately got someone to remove the propeller and bring it to the Quality Inspection Department for inspection.”

“Seeing Cen Jiang come over, the head of the quality inspection department smiled and said, “Why is team leader Cen, a busy man, so free to come over today?””

Cen Jiang asked someone to carry the propeller up. “This needs a new quality inspection.”

“A new quality inspection?”The head of the quality inspection department immediately put away his joking expression. “Could there be a problem?”

“”Miss Ye said that this propeller is unqualified, so she asked me to send it here for a new inspection.””

“The head of the quality inspection department looked at the quality inspection report on the propeller, then he said, “This Xiao Lu is in charge of the quality inspection. Xiao Lu is so careful, so there shouldn’t be any mistakes. Moreover, I can’t see what’s wrong with this propeller. Is Miss ye mistaken?””

“Cen Jiang continued, “Miss ye said that there are some problems that can’t be seen with the naked eye. Minister Wang, Take it and re-examine it.””

“Okay.”Minister Wang nodded. “Then follow me.”

The two of them walked into the quality inspection department.

“Xiaolu, who was in charge of the quality inspection, was checking the equipment. When he saw minister Wang coming over, he immediately greeted, “Minister Wang, group leader Cen.””
