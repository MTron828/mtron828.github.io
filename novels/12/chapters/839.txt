Ye Zhuo put down the pen and walked over to open the door.

The door was pulled open.

There was no one behind.

No One?

Ye Zhuo raised her eyebrows slightly. Could it be that she had heard wrongly?

“Little did she know that at the corner, Old Lady Cen and Xiao Bai were hiding together, covering their mouths and laughing. ”

Ye Zhuo closed the door and went back to continue painting.

“Just as he added a few strokes, there was another knock on the door. ”

“After confirming that it was not an auditory hallucination this time, ye Zhuo walked over to open the door. ”

“But after opening the door, there was still no one outside. ”

“Who is it?”

No one answered.

“Ye Zhuo continued, “If you don’t speak, I’ll close the door.” ”

Still no one spoke.

Ye Zhuo looked outside the door and was about to close the door when old Mrs. Cen jumped out from the side. “Surprise! Yezi! Are you surprised?”

“Grandma Cen!”Ye Zhuo’s face was full of surprise.

“”Big Yezi!”Old Mrs. Cen ran over and hugged ye Zhuo excitedly. “Yezi, long time no see. I’ve missed you.” ”

Old Mrs. Cen had originally wanted Cen Shaoqing to bring ye Zhuo back this week.

Who knew that Cen Shaoqing had some urgent business to attend to and had gone abroad on a business trip.

“Therefore, old Mrs. Cen personally came to look for ye Zhuo. ”

“”I miss you too.”Ye Zhuo continued, “Grandma Cen, where did you come from? Why didn’t you tell me? I could have gone to pick you up.” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen snorted lightly, “I already said that I would give you a surprise. If I were to inform you, what kind of surprise would that be?” ” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Ye Zhuo helped old Mrs. Cen in and then poured her a cup of Iced Coke.

“Old Mrs. Cen picked up the Ice Cola and said with a smile, “Ye, you know me! They don’t let me drink the fat otaku water. I’m already so old. What’s wrong with drinking the fat otaku water?” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen’s expression changed very quickly. She was still smiling one second ago, but in the next second, she became angry. ”

She was like a child.

“Ye Zhuo could not help but laugh, “Grandma Cen, fatty otaku water is a carbonated drink that contains a lot of sugar. If you drink too much of it, it will increase the burden on the human body to metabolize sugar. So, you have to control yourself and drink it in moderation.” ”

Old Mrs. Cen did not listen to anyone.

Only Ye Zhuo was an exception.

“When she heard this, she immediately asked, “What’s the appropriate amount?” ”

Ye Zao Thought for a moment. “About one cup a week.”

One Cup a week?

“Old Mrs. Cen: so, happiness will disappear, right? ”

“Seeing Old Mrs. Cen like this, ye Zao continued, “If you’re thinking of making peace, you can try sugar-free. Actually, isn’t fat otaku water just for a sip?” ”

“Is there still sugar-free water?”Old Mrs. Cen seemed to have opened the door to a new world.

“Ye zhuo nodded, “But sugar-free water can’t be drunk in large quantities. If you really can’t hold it in, you can use sugar-free water to satisfy your craving.” ”

“”Oh, I see.” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen gulped down the coke in her cup and burped in satisfaction, “It feels great!” ”

“The best Grandma in the universe. is the fat otaku water good?”Little White came over and asked.

“It’s good.”Old Mrs. Cen nodded. “Do you want to have a sip?”

Little White took a few steps back. “I’ll charge it!”

“Old Mrs. Cen snorted. “If you want to drink it, I won’t give it to you.” ”

“After saying that, old Mrs. Cen’s gaze fell on a ball of paper on the ground. She picked it up casually and opened it to take a look. It was fine to take a look. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen was immediately stunned. She raised her head to look at Ye Zao. “Ye, who drew this painting?” ”

“”I did,”ye Zao answered. ”

“You drew it?”Old Mrs. Cen’s eyes were filled with shock.

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded.

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “It was so well drawn. Why did you throw it away?” ”

“Looking at the ball of paper, Old Mrs. Cen’s heart ached terribly. ”

“Ye Zao said somewhat embarrassedly, “The painting wasn’t good, so I threw it away.” ”

Not Good?

This was called painting was not good?

Old Mrs. Cen suspected that Ye Zao was joking.

And there was evidence.

“”No! Your painting is very good!”Old Mrs. Cen continued, “It’s simply superb!” ”

Superb?

“Ye Zao suspected that old Mrs. Cen was mocking her, “Grandma Cen, don’t laugh at me! This painting is a defective product. It’s not as exaggerated as you said. Look here, here, and here. These are all areas that were not properly handled.” ”

Defective product?

Old Mrs. Cen suspected that she was deaf.

Ye Zhuo actually said that such a good painting was a defective product.

If such a painting was called a defective product.

Then what are the names of those master paintings in the Chinese Painting Circle?
