“In the eyes of the Si Lui, Zhao Xueyin was the person who could make him give up everything. ”

He was willing to do anything for Zhao Xueyin.

“Seeing the Si lui like this, uncle Fu sighed helplessly, “Young master, I know that you still hold a grudge against master, but Master is your biological father after all! He will not harm you. If Miss Zhao is really worth it for you to pay for her, Will Master Stop You?” ”

“Si lui snorted, “Biological father? In his eyes, am I his biological son?” ”

Si Lui would never forget the scene five years ago.

“Young Master!”

“”Uncle Fu, stop.”Si lui waved his hand, “I know what I am doing, I will never regret it!” ”

“Uncle fu frowned, “Young master, in fact, all these years, master was also in pain! He was also deceived by others... think about it from another perspective, if you were the master at that time, what would you do?” ”

The matter back then was too complicated.

“Now that five years had passed, uncle Fu thought that the lawyer would more or less let go. ”

He did not expect that the lawyer’s hatred for Master Jin was still so deep.

Think from another perspective?

“Hearing this, the lawyer’s eyes were full of ridicule. He looked up at Uncle Fu. “Think from another perspective? Would I be as stupid as him? To be deceived like that by a woman?” ”

“For the sake of a woman, Old Master Jin did not even care about his own son. ”

This kind of person was not fit to be a father!

“Uncle Fu sighed again. “Young master, have you ever thought that the current you is the old master from back then? You Can’t even see the current situation clearly. The old master is just an ordinary person!” ”

“Those who were in the middle of the situation were confused, while those who were watching from the sidelines were clear. ”

“In uncle Fu’s view, the current Si lui was the old master Jin from back then. ”

He was just as stubborn and unrepentant.

He wouldn’t turn back until he hit the wall.

Si lui looked up at Uncle Fu. “I’m not him! I Won’t be as stupid as him!”

“Uncle Fu continued, “Young master, if Zhao Xueyin really has you in her heart, would it have delayed you for so many years?” ”

Si Lui’s expression was very cold. “There’s no need for others to comment on the matters between us!”

“Young Master!”Uncle Fu was very anxious when he saw the lawyer’s reaction.

“The lawyer tried his best to calm himself down, “Uncle Fu, I don’t want to quarrel with you. “You don’t have to look for me anymore. Jin Ruyu died five years ago. The person standing in front of you is the lawyer. The lawyer is just the lawyer. He has nothing to do with the Jin family.” ”

He only wanted to live a good life as a lawyer. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“After saying this, the lawyer turned around and left. ”

Uncle Fu looked at the lawyer’s back and his eyes turned red.

Similar.

Too similar.

This determined back view was exactly the same as Old Master Jin’s back then.

PA —

The door was closed.

Uncle Fu Sighed.

“After a long while, uncle Fu walked out of the conference room. ”

On the balcony on the fifteenth floor.

Si Lu finished his last cigarette and went to the elevator. He pressed the button.

Ding —

The elevator door opened.

There were several people standing inside.

“Si Lu immediately saw ye Zhuo, who was standing at the innermost part of the elevator. ”

“After the banquet, she had changed back into her usual clothes. ”

It was a simple black coat and white pants.

“She wore a burgundy coat and a black hat on her head. The wide brim of the hat covered her facial features, and her whole body exuded an almost refreshing coldness. ”

“Although her face could not be seen clearly, it gave people a strong feeling that she stood out from the crowd. ”

Si Lu frowned slightly.

He could not help but think of the way ye Zhuo looked when she was eating macarons.

It was a kind of reverence for food.

The reverence that came from her bones.

It could not be faked.

Si Lu suddenly could not understand ye Zhuo.

Ding —

The elevator door closed.

Si Lu collected his thoughts.

The display screen of the elevator kept jumping.

“15,14,13 — ”

Bang!

“When the elevator reached the 10th floor, the entire elevator suddenly sank. ”

PA!

“In a split second, the lights in the elevator also exploded. ”

“Ah!”

“What happened?”

“Did the elevator malfunction?”

“Am I going to die?”

“What should I do? I don’t want to Die!”

“”Mommy, come and save me...” ”

“Grandma!”

“Daddy!”

“In just a blink of an eye, the elevator became a mess. ”

“Everyone was arguing, screaming, and crying. ”

In the darkness.

Si lui just stood there.

His entire body was trembling.

He had a severe phobia of claustrophobia.

“For a moment, Si Lui’s forehead was covered in layers of cold sweat. ”

“”Don’t panic.”At this moment, a clear and shallow voice rang out in the crowd. “The elevator has just encountered an obstacle in its operation. Everyone, calm down and wait for rescue.” ”
