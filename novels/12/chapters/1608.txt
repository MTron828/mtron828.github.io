Chapter 1609: 342: Mu Yourong’s death is decided internally? 6

Translator: 549690339

“Song Shiyu looked down at Mu Yourong from above. His gaze was sinister, like a demon that had crawled out from the depths of hell. ”

“After a moment, Mu Yourong raised her head and suppressed the panic in her heart. She said weakly, “Please let me die, give me a quick death!” ”

“Rather than live with no dignity and suffering, it was better to die. ”

Song Shiyu did not speak and slowly put on his gloves.

“Mu Yourong knew what he wanted to do next. “Song Shiyu, I Beg You...” ”

“Do you want to die?”Song Shiyu pinched Mu Yourong’s chin. “It’s not that easy!”

Mu Yourong closed her eyes in despair.

If.

“If there was an afterlife, she would definitely not choose to leave song Shiyu. ”

She would do everything in her power to make song Shiyu fall in love with her.

“She would make song Shiyu fall in love with her but not be able to. She would make him her dog, be at her beck and call, and pay with his life for her! ”

“She would make the person sitting here, conservatively suffering, become that slut ye Zhuo. ”

Wrong.

She was wrong.

She had been wrong from the start.

“If she had known that the only thing that was missing between her and Ye Zhuo was the bite mark on her arm, no matter what price she had to pay, she would have made the exact same bite mark. ”

Regret.

Mu Yourong was very regretful now.

She regretted that she had not clearly investigated the entanglement between her and song Shiyu.

“Since the heavens had given her a second life, they would definitely give her a second one. ”

Wait.

“Next time, she would definitely let ye Zao die without a complete corpse. ”

“As she thought of this, Mu Yourong’s eyes emitted a sinister look. Soon after, her pupils gradually dilated, and in the end, she lost her breath just like that. ”

“Unfortunately, Mu Yourong would never have thought that her rebirth was also because of the butterfly effect brought about by Ye Zhuo’s rebirth. ”

“If it wasn’t for Ye Zhuo’s rebirth, she wouldn’t have had any chance of rebirth. ”

Death was like a lamp going out.

“In the future, Mu Yourong would never appear in the world again. ”

Song Shiyu frowned slightly.

How did she die so quickly?

“In a flash, song Shiyu took off his rubber gloves and turned to look at his assistant. “Take care of it.” ”

“”Yes, Boss.”The assistant bowed slightly. ”

Song Shiyu turned around and walked out of the door.

The assistant called the cleanup team over.

“Mu Yourong was a fugitive on death row with a bounty of 100,000 yuan. No one would care about how she died. ”

The next day.

All the major news reported the sudden death of a fugitive on the run.

Ye Zhuodi looked at the news on his phone with an indifferent expression.

She wasn’t surprised to see the news of Mu Yourong’s death.

A person like Mu Yourong deserved to die.

“”Miss Ye! Miss Ye!”At this moment, Tang Mi ran in from outside. ”

Ye Zhuo put away his phone. “What’s Wrong?”

“Tang mi couldn’t hide the excitement on her face. “Miss Ye, your method is already effective! Now that the nuclear reaction and protons have changed, please come and take a look!” ”

Ye Zhuo followed Tang Mi and walked to the laboratory.

A lot of people had already gathered in the laboratory.

“”Miss Ye, you’re amazing! I thought that our aircraft carrier plan would stop at the power materials. I didn’t expect that Miss Ye has really changed the nuclear reactor and Protons!” ”

“If they had not seen it with their own eyes, who would believe that it was true? ”

“”I’ve already said it. With Miss ye around, there’s no need to worry at all!” ”

“Miss Ye is simply my goddess!”

“Keep your voice down when you say that. Be careful that master five will hear you!”

“Everyone spoke one after another. When they saw ye Zao come over, they immediately made way for him. ”

“”Miss Ye, look quickly!” ”

Ye Zao walked over.

“Unlike everyone present, there wasn’t much excitement on her face. She turned to Cen Jiang and said, “Team leader Cen.” ”

“Miss Ye!”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Issue a notice that no one in the greater C zone is allowed to spread this news.” ”

“Alright.”Cen Jiang nodded and did not ask ye Zhuo why. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“”In addition,”ye Zhuo continued, “In the future, have the legal department draft a confidentiality agreement. In the future, no matter what happens in our greater C zone, we are not allowed to reveal it to the outside world or other zones! If there are any violators, they will be punished according to the rules!” ”

Cen Jiang nodded. “Alright. I’ll do it right away!”

“After signing the confidentiality agreement, the CEN base rarely heard about aircraft carriers. ”

“A week later, Tang Xue felt that something was not quite right. She turned to look at her assistant. “Has there been any movement in the greater c region recently?” ”

The assistant shook his head. “There hasn’t been any movement.”

“Then.., the assistant continued, “The matter of the power raw materials hasn’t been resolved yet. What kind of movement do you think there will be? “Let the nuclear reactors and protons undergo changes before producing the power raw materials. Don’t you think this is a joke? “Once they resolve this problem, the three-year agreement will be up!” ”
