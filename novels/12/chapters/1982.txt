Translator: 549690339

“Qiu Di clenched his fists, his entire body trembling. “Little Bastard, do you really think that I won’t dare to kill you?” ”

He didn’t even have the time to react. He had already been goaded by Yi Ling.

“Yi Ling looked at Qiu Di’s falling hand, her eyes slightly red. ”

“I’m sorry, burning. ”

He really couldn’t hold on any longer.

“He was very hungry, very tired, and very tired. He was simply living a life worse than death. ”

Death was actually a kind of relief to it.

“In the next second, autumn flute’s hand tightly grabbed onto Yi Ling’s neck. ”

Bang.

It was also at this time that autumn flute’s hand was struck by a huge blow and was forced to release Yi Ling.

“Di’er! What are you doing?”

Autumn flute turned around. The anger on his face also completely disappeared at this time. “Father!”

“Qiu Changzhen picked up the spirit from the ground and looked at the wounded spirit. He frowned and looked at Qiu Di. “Di’er, didn’t I tell you? You have to win over the spirit! What have you done? !”Qiu Di was good at everything, he had the ability, but he was too young and too impulsive. ”

“If a battle uniform lost the spirit, it would be like losing a soul! ”

“He had told autumn flute many times not to offend the spirit no matter what. If she couldn’t do it the hard way, then she would do it the soft way. However, autumn flute refused to listen. ” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Autumn Flute’s face was cold. “Father, it is because you have protected it so many times that it dares to be so arrogant!” ”

“If autumn town had not stopped her, she would have long killed the spirit. ”

“Do you know what the spirit represents?”Qiu Changzhen asked.

“Qiu di snorted, “I don’t believe it. If it weren’t for the spirit, I wouldn’t be able to hold that position!” ”

“Qiu changzhen frowned and continued, “Di’er, you’re underestimating the position of the spirit in Chang Yue! Look at this!”Qiu Changzhen handed Qiu di a communication device. ”

“After looking at the communication device, Qiu Di’s expression changed. ”

“Qiu Changzhen continued, “Therefore, di’er, you must not harm Yi Ling’s life now. You must slowly tame it. Let it be used by you. Ye Zhuo is already dead. As long as you use Yi Ling well, you will be the new ruler of the Chang Yue Kingdom in the future. No one will be able to influence your position in the future.” ”

Qiu Di’s future was bright. Why bother with a dead person.

The dead person was already dead.

Could it be that she could get up from the liquid nitrogen room and threaten Qiu di’s position?

It was simply a fantasy!

“When she said this, Qiu di narrowed her eyes. ”

She was indeed too impatient earlier.

She shouldn’t have wanted to take Yiling’s life.

“Qiu Di turned to look at Qiu Changzhen. “Father, I was indeed lacking in consideration in this matter.” ”

“Qiu Changzhen nodded and continued, “It’s good that you know it in your heart.”After saying that, he continued, “You must know your limits. No matter what, you must not harm Yi Ling’s life.” ”

“Alright.”

Qiu Changzhen took out a pill from his pocket and fed it to Yi Ling.

This pill was given by the Great Witch Doctor and its effects were very good.

“The moment Yi Ling ate it, she felt a warm current in her body. All the pain in her body disappeared and what followed was a familiar feeling. ”

The Great Witch Doctor!

This was the Great Witch Doctor’s pill.

Yi Ling suddenly opened her eyes.

“She and ye Zao had long since become one. Ye Zao had fought with the Great Witch Doctor in his early years, so he was very familiar with the great witch doctor. ”

So...

The Great Witch Doctor was not dead!

“If the Great Witch Doctor was not dead, then he must have had something to do with Ye Zao’s disappearance. ”

“The Great Witch Doctor was an extremely dark person. He was good at hiding in the dark and stabbing people in the dark. If the Great Witch Doctor’s handiwork was involved, then these things could be easily explained! ”

“At this moment, the collar regained his lost will and confidence. ”

He couldn’t die.

He couldn’t die.

“If he died, if ye Zao came back in the future, he wouldn’t be able to see him anymore. ”

He had to survive!

“Great Zao Zao, he had to come back earlier to pick her up. ”

...

On the other side.

The eight great clans.

“The great clan leader sat at the head of the table. “Everyone, it’s going to be the day of the general election soon. In your opinion, do you want to support autumn flute?” ”

“Hearing this, the few clan leaders below the stage discussed animatedly. ”

“Logically speaking, autumn flute should be ye Zhuo’s only successor. After all, Ye Zhuo had once given everything to autumn flute. ”

“”How about this,”the head chief thought for a moment and said, “Those who support autumn flute, stand to my left.” ”

“After saying this, the second clan leader stood up from his seat. Just as he was about to walk to the left of the head chief, he turned around and saw that the other five clan leaders were still sitting on the same spot. The second clan leader was stunned, “None of you are prepared to support Lady Autumn Flute?” ”

“The position of a female sovereign is not a small matter. Qiu Di is too young.”The Five clan leaders spoke.
