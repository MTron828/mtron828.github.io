Translator: 549690339

“If Earth was really that bad, Bai Jingshu wouldn’t have liked Earth’s culture so much. If Lin Ze was really that bad, Bai Jingshu wouldn’t have fallen in love with him at all costs. ”

Happiness was something like a fish drinking cold water and knowing its own temperature. It wasn’t a symbol of happiness to live in a high-end galaxy.

“Many times, the people of S Galaxy were not as happy as the people on Earth. ”

“”Thank you, Jingfei.”Bai Jingzhu reached out and hugged Bai Jingfei. “The things in the past are all in the past. Moreover, if it weren’t for you, I would be a clone now.” ”

“Although Bai Jingfei was a little willful in the past, she did not do anything unforgivable in the end. ”

“From a certain perspective, Bai Jingfei could be considered a qualified younger sister. ”

“A moment later, Bai Jingfei released Bai Jingshu and took out a red packet from her bag. She handed it to Bai Jingshu. “I heard that everyone on Earth is interested in this. SIS, take this as my blessing to you.” ”

The red packet was so thin that it was impossible to tell what was inside.

“Bai Jingshu knew that Bai Jingfei’s life in the Bai family was not easy, so she did not want to accept it. She said, “Jingfei, your sister received your wish...” ”

“Before Bai Jingshu could finish, Bai Jingfei stuffed the red packet into Bai Jingshu’s hand. “This is a blessing. Don’t reject it.” ”

“Bai jingfei wiped away her tears. “Alright, I should go back! I snuck out today. If they find out, I’ll be finished!” ”

The Bai family’s parents had long severed their ties with Bai Jingshu. They would never allow their children to attend an Earthling’s wedding banquet.

“Then you should hurry back!”Bai Jingshu immediately said.

“”Okay, I’ll go back first.”Bai jingfei nodded and turned to walk out of the door. ”

Bai Jingshu followed her footsteps.

“When she arrived at the bedroom, Bai Jingfei did not forget to warn Lin Ze. “Lin Ze, I’m warning you. Don’t bully my sister in the future. Otherwise, I’ll teach you a lesson! The eldest sister of our Bai family is not to be trifled with!” ”

Lin Ze turned to look at Bai Jingshu.

“Bai Jingshu immediately introduced, “This is my second sister, Bai Jingfei.” ”

“Lin Ze nodded and looked at Bai Jingfei. “Don’t worry, second sister. I definitely won’t bully your sister.” ”

“”You’d better remember what you said today.”After saying that, Bai Jingfei greeted old master Bai and Bai Sanfeng, then immediately turned around and left. ”

“After Bai Jingfei turned around and left, she realized that something was definitely not right. who was that old lady that she saw in Bai Jingshu’s room just now? ”

Why didn’t she remember that the Bai family had such a relative?

Could it be a relative of the Lin Family?

“Also, when she entered the Bai family, she didn’t hear any jeers from the guests. ”

This was very wrong!

Bai Jingfei was puzzled as she boarded the aircraft.

“As soon as she returned to the Bai family, she saw her parents walking out of the door. They looked a little excited. ”

“”Jingfei!”When they saw Bai Jingfei, the Bai family’s parents became even more excited. ”

“Especially the Bai family’s mother, Zhou Ying. ”

“”What’s wrong, Mom?”Bai Jingfei asked. ”

“Zhou Ying continued, “Jingfei, did you just go to your grandfather’s house to visit your sister?” ”

“No!”Bai Jingfei immediately denied it.

“If her parents knew that she secretly went to visit Bai Jingzhu, it would be over! ”

“Really?”Zhou Ying asked with a smile. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Although Zhou Ying was smiling, Bai Jingfei felt a little scared. ”

This kind of smile was too abnormal!

“I really didn’t!”Bai Jingfei answered.

“”Look at you, child. If you went, so be it. After all, she is your biological sister and our biological daughter. Do you think we can stop you from visiting her?”Zhou Ying continued, “By the way, when you went, your sister wasn’t angry, right? Did she give you a hard time?” ”

Bai Jingfei looked at Zhou Ying and suddenly couldn’t react.

Why did her mother suddenly become like this?

Something was wrong!

“Your mother is asking you a question! Are You Mute?”Father Bai continued to speak.

“Bai jingfei continued to deny, “Father and mother, I really didn’t go to visit my sister! You have misunderstood!” ”

“Zhou Ying still maintained her smile and continued, “I know you went. Jingfei, don’t worry. Your father and I have already forgiven your sister. Tell us, is your sister angry with you?” ”

“Looking at Zhou Ying like this, Bai Jingfei was a little hesitant. “Dad, Mom, are you really not angry with my sister?” ”

“We’re really not angry! Your father and I are going to send your sister off to her wedding!”

Bai Jingfei’s face was full of confusion. What exactly happened?

Why did her parents suddenly have such a big change?

“Before Bai Jingfei could react, Zhou Ying continued, “Jingfei, quickly tell me, was there a lot of people at the wedding today? Was Old Lady Shangguan also there?” ”

“Who is Old Lady Shangguan?”Bai Jingfei asked.

“”Old Lady Shangguan is of course the head of the Shangguan Family!”Zhou Ying continued, “Did you encounter any unfamiliar faces at your grandfather’s House?” ”

Yes.

The Bai family’s parents had already heard about Old Lady Shangguan!

But they were also worried that it was all a lie.

“If Lin Ze really became the heir of the Shangguan family, then their family would be rich! ”

“Bai Jingfei thought for a moment. “I don’t know, but there is indeed an unfamiliar face.” ”

“Hearing this, Father Bai was very excited. “Is it an old lady?” ”

“Yes.”Bai jingfei nodded. “She looks about seventy or eighty years old and is in good spirits. She is holding a walking stick with a dragon head in her hand! She looks somewhat familiar!”

“”Then she must be Old Lady Shangguan!”Zhou Ying continued, “Then let’s go to the old house!” ”

Father Bai nodded. “Let’s Go!”

They could not miss Bai Jingzhu’s wedding.

Lin Ze’s status was different now. They had to suck up to this son-in-law.
