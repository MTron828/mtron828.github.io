Translator: 549690339

It had to be said that ye Sui sometimes saw things much more clearly than others.

“When she became Mrs. Ma, those people outside would never be able to compare to her! ”

“Thinking of this, Zhou Ziyue’s eyes were full of determination. ”

“Ye Sui continued, “So, ziyue, you have to suffer through hardships to become a better person. The hardships you are suffering now are all paving the way for your future happiness.” ”

“Thinking about how she would be able to attain the Dao and raise her family to heaven, ye Sui was very excited. ” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

He felt even more honored.

“After all, Zhou Ziyue was her daughter. She had nurtured and educated her well, which was why Zhou Ziyue had her current achievements. ”

“”Okay, mom, I understand.”Zhou Ziyue nodded. ”

“”It’s good that you know.”Seeing Zhou Ziyue like this, ye Sui nodded in relief. ”

On the other side.

“After dealing with the matters in the capital, Feng Yang bought a plane ticket back to cloud capital. ”

“Before returning to cloud capital, Feng Yang edited a text message and sent it to Zhou Ziyue. ”

He and Zhou Ziyue had a story of ten years.

These ten years could not be forgotten just like that.

“Therefore, he planned to give himself a chance and also give Zhou Ziyue a chance. ”

“After sending the text message, Feng Yang went to the address on the text message. ”

An hour passed.

Two hours passed.

“In the end, he still didn’t see Zhou Ziyue’s figure. ”

“Feng Yang looked into the distance, and his eyes gradually became moist. ”

“At this moment, he suddenly saw a familiar figure. ”

It was Zhou Ziyue.

Zhou ziyue came?

“He knew that Zhou Ziyue was definitely like him, unable to let go of the feelings of these ten years. ”

“Zi...”the remaining word ‘Yue’was stuck in Feng Yang’s throat just like that.

What did he see?

“He saw Zhou Ziyue actually hugging a man’s arm, smiling sweetly. ”

“The man’s facial features were not very friendly, but even if they were very far away, one could still see the rich and noble aura on his body. Not only that, there were even bodyguards behind him. ”

Feng Yang took a few steps back weakly.

He had waited for so long...

In the end...

Was this the result he had been waiting for?

“He had thought that there was only pure love between him and Zhou Ziyue, but it was not the case. ”

“Handsome.”

“At this moment, a pleasant female voice suddenly appeared in the air. ”

Feng Yang looked up and saw that it was a young woman with wavy curly hair.

She was very good-looking.

“”Hello,”Feng Yang said. ”

“The young woman continued, “Handsome, do you know Zhou Ziyue?” ”

“Yes.”Feng Yang nodded.

“”No Wonder,”the young woman continued, “My name is Nina.” ”

“”Feng Yang,”Feng Yang said. ”

“Nina smiled and said, “Are you and Zhou Ziyue a couple?” ”

“”We used to be,”Feng Yang said. ”

“Nina covered her mouth and smiled, “That’s true. But you’re so handsome, how do you see Zhou Ziyue?” ”

“Feng Yang didn’t say anything, ”

“nina continued, “Handsome, there are plenty of fish in the sea. Don’t be sad. Actually, this is a good thing for you. Zhou Ziyue will betray you now, but she can still get married in the future. Do you know who the person beside Zhou Ziyue is? The Young Master of the Ma Corporation, Ma Lu. When Zhou Ziyue and Ma Lu went on blind dates, she claimed that she was single. She even said that she would tolerate anything for Ma Lu. Even if Ma Lu hugged her from both sides, she wouldn’t care.” ”

“”To be honest, this is the first time I’ve seen a girl like her.” ”

“You’re really not worth it.”

Feng Yang couldn’t stand still.

His heart was broken.

It turned out that Zhou Ziyue had wanted to break up with him a long time ago. He thought that he had done something wrong and that Zhou Ziyue wanted to break up with him... ...

Everything had been planned for a long time.

“Thank you for telling me all this.”Feng Yang turned to look at Nina.

“Nina smiled and said, “You’re welcome. Actually, I’m the same as her. I love vanity.” ”

“However, she didn’t have a boyfriend like Feng Yang. ”

“”However, the only difference is,”nina paused and continued, “I never lie.” ”

“At this point, Nina continued, “It’s a good thing to get rid of people like Zhou Ziyue. I wish you peace and happiness for the rest of your life.” ”

“”Thank you,”Feng Yang said. ”

“You’re welcome.”

“After saying this, Nina turned around and left. ”

Feng Yang suddenly felt less sad. He picked up his suitcase and walked towards the airport.

“After a four-hour flight, Feng Yang arrived in Yun Jing. ”

The first thing he did after returning home was to buy a house.

“After mother Feng learned about this, she couldn’t help but blame, “Why didn’t you discuss it with Ziyue! What if she doesn’t like it?” ”

“”Mom.”Feng Yang carefully chose his words in his heart. Then, he looked at his mother and said, “I broke up with Zhou Ziyue.” ”

“Broke up?”Mother Feng’s reaction wasn’t as surprised as Feng Yang had imagined.

“Yes.”Feng Yang nodded.

“Mother Feng looked at Feng Yang and said, “It’s good that we broke up.” ”

“This time, it was Feng Yang’s turn to be surprised. He looked at mother Feng and asked, “Mom, are you telling the truth?” ”

“”Why not?”Mother Feng continued, “There are some things I didn’t want to say, but now that you two have broken up, it’s okay for me to say it.” ”

“What is it?”Feng Yang asked.

“You and Zhou Ziyue were never compatible from the beginning.”

“Mother Feng paused, “When Zhou Ziyue first came to our house, I felt that this girl was not someone who could live at home, let alone behave herself! “But there’s nothing we can do about it. You like her! “So your father and I can only respect your opinion. We thought that since the two of you are in love, maybe she could make a change for you.” ”

“Unfortunately, in the end, the two of them still went their separate ways. ”

“”Mom, you have never told me these things!”Feng Yang’s eyes were full of shock. ”

“Mother Feng smiled and said, “Because I know that you really like her. If I had stopped your development at that time, would you have listened to me? Since I couldn’t stop her, then I might as well wish her well!” ”

“Speaking up to this point, mother Feng held Feng Yang’s hand, then she said, “Yang Yang, you and she are not from the same world. Now that you have separated, I am very happy. Don’t feel any regrets. In the future, if she regrets it, you are not allowed to go back to the way things were. A man can not be lacking in ambition.” ”

“Although Feng Yang could not be considered outstanding, he could definitely be considered outstanding among ordinary people. ”

“He was a small leader in the unit. He had a car and a house. His parents were both civil servants. When he got old, he would have a pension. In the future, he would not need to have any worries. ”

“”Mom, I know.” ”

“Mother Feng continued, “How about this? From tomorrow onwards, I will pay attention to the right girl for you. Our unit does not have many things. We only have many young and beautiful girls.” ”

“”There’s no need for that, Mom,”Feng Yang continued, “I don’t want to start a new relationship so soon for the time being.” ”

“At the moment, he wanted to focus on his work. ”

“”That’s fine too.”Mother Feng knew Feng Yang very well, so she was not worried that he would turn back. She continued, “If you ever want to find someone, just let me know.” ”

“Okay.”

“After listening to his mother’s words, Feng Yang’s mood became even more cheerful. ”

He thought that his mother would be sad and sad.

“It turned out that everyone had seen the true nature of Zhou Ziyue, but he was the only one who had not seen it clearly. ”

He was really a fool.

“Feng Yang looked at the sunlight outside the window. At this moment, he was filled with confidence and hope for the future. ”

In the capital.

“Today, not only did Feng Yang see Zhou Ziyue, but Zhou Ziyue also saw Feng Yang. ”

“After returning home, Zhou Ziyue’s heart was still in a panic. ”

“Because the love in Feng Yang’s eyes could not be stopped. She was afraid that Ma Lu would discover something, and even more afraid that Feng Yang would run to Ma Lu and spout nonsense. ”

What should she do?

What should she do now?

“If Ma Lu knew that she had an ex-boyfriend, Ma Lu would definitely break up with her. ”

No.

She couldn’t break up with Ma Lu.

“After thinking about it, Zhou Ziyue decided to give Feng Yang a call. ”

“Soon, Feng Yang picked up. ”

“Hello.”

“”Feng Yang, did you see everything today?”Zhou Ziyue asked. ”

“See what?”Feng Yang asked.

“Zhou ziyue continued, “The person standing beside me today is my current boyfriend. I advise you not to overestimate yourself. You are not from the same world as him.” ”

“What are you trying to say?”Feng Yang asked.

“Zhou ziyue said, “I’m warning you. Don’t go to my boyfriend and talk nonsense, or else...” ”

“”Don’t worry, I Won’t go to your current boyfriend and say anything,”Feng Yang said word by word. “Zhou Ziyue, we won’t have any relationship in the future.” ”

“After saying that, Feng Yang hung up the phone. ”

This phone call could be considered to be the end of their relationship.

“In the future, they wouldn’t have any relationship anymore. ”

“Looking at the phone that was suddenly hung up, Zhou Ziyue was stunned. For a moment, she didn’t know how to react. ”

Feng Yang...

Seemed to be different from before.

She didn’t expect that Feng Yang would suddenly become so heartless.
