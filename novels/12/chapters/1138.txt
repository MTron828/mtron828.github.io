“Chapter 1139: 248: When I see Zhao Xueyin’s true face, I’ll cut her in half! 3”

Translator: 549690339

In the past.

She could have helped the Jiang Corporation for Jiang Xiaoyu’s sake.

But now.

It was impossible!

Since Jiang Xiaoyu didn’t know what was good for her.

Then don’t blame her for being impolite.

“When the time came, even if Jiang Xiaoyu knelt down for her, she wouldn’t forgive Jiang Xiaoyu! ”

“Zhao Xueyin narrowed her eyes and dialed the secretary’s internal line. “Linda, come up for a moment.” ”

“Soon, secretary-general Linda came up. ”

“”Miss Zhao, you were looking for me,”Linda said respectfully. ”

Zhao Xueyin pressed her temples. “Check if anything happened at the Imperial Court Hotel Last Night.”

“Although Zhao Xueyin did not personally experience it, she still felt that something must have happened last night. ”

“Otherwise, the lawyer would not have been conquered by Ye Zhuo so quickly! ”

And Jiang Xiaoyu.

Jiang Xiaoyu’s sudden defection must have happened last night as well.

“Okay.”Linda nodded.

“What Happened Last Night at the Imperial Court Hotel was not a secret. The people trapped in the elevator were all important figures in the financial world. Even if the hotel wanted to suppress the matter, it was impossible to do so. ”

“Half an hour later, Linda had investigated the matter clearly. ”

Linda handed the information she found to Zhao Xueyin. “The name of Old Lady Jiang was on the list of people who were trapped last night.” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Zhao Xueyin took the document Linda handed over and actually saw the name of the lawyer in the information.

“Zhao Xueyin looked up at Linda. “So, the lawyer was also at the scene.” ”

Linda nodded. “Yes.”

Zhao Xueyin’s lips curled up.

So that was how it was.

No wonder the lawyer treated ye Zhuo so well overnight.

An elevator accident?

Perhaps the elevator incident was done by Ye Zhuo himself.

“Otherwise, how could it be so coincidental that ye Zhuo and the lawyer were locked up inside? ”

The Sea King was the Sea King.

“Indeed, there were many tricks up his sleeve. ”

It was unexpected.

He could even cause an elevator accident.

How could an ordinary person think of an elevator accident?

It was also the lawyer’s fault for being stupid.

He couldn’t even see through such tricks!

How could such a person be qualified to be her backup?

“Thinking of this, Zhao Xueyin’s eyes were filled with disgust. ”

It was worse than eating a fly.

“After a while, Zhao Xueyin waved her hand. “I got it. You can leave now.” ”

Linda bent down slightly and turned to walk out of the door.

“”Wait a minute,”Zhao Xueyin said immediately. ”

“”Miss Zhao, do you have any other instructions?”Linda stopped and turned to look at Zhao Xueyin. ”

“Zhao Xueyin said, “Don’t mention to anyone about the matter I asked you to investigate.” ”

“I know.”Linda nodded.

It was past four in the afternoon.

“After much hesitation, the lawyer finally knocked on Zhao Xueyin’s office door. ”

“It was Zhao Xueyin’s assistant who opened the door. “I’m sorry, director Si, it’s not convenient for Miss Zhao to see guests now.” ”

“Alright.”Disappointment flashed in the lawyer’s eyes.

It seemed that Zhao Xueyin was really angry.

“Just as she was about to turn around and leave, Zhao Xueyin’s voice came from inside. “Let chairman si come in.” ”

Only then did the assistant make a ‘please’gesture.

Si Lui’s heart was filled with joy as he quickly walked inside. “Xueyin.”

“Big Brother Zhao.”Zhao Xueyin raised her head and smiled at Si Lui.

“Si lui continued, “Xueyin, I’m sorry about what happened this morning. I know that you’re feeling very uncomfortable now, but I’m not targeting you. I just think that Miss Ye’s plan is feasible. The consortium has been going downhill for five consecutive years. What if Miss Ye really has the ability to turn the tide? This is also a good thing for you... “...”. “...” ”

“To Si Lui, he only approved of ye Zhuo’s plan. He did not recognize ye Zhuo as a person. ”

“After saying that, Si lui paused and continued, “Xueyin, don’t worry. I’ll still support you as before.” ”

“”Don’t say anymore. I know.”A bitter smile appeared on Zhao Xueyin’s lips. “Just like last night’s clash, Ye Zhuo has always been an existence that everyone admires. I can only act as a foil to her!” ”

This sentence made Si Lui’s heart ache.

“He had only cared about ye Zao saving him. If Zhao Xueyin did not say anything, Si lui would have forgotten about the clash of clothing incident. ”

Si lui frowned slightly.

“Zhao Xueyin continued, “Brother Si, if ye Zao’s proposal was really made by herself, do you think I would object? “I am the Acting Chief of the consortium. I hope that the consortium can regain its former glory more than anyone else!” ”

“That plan was obviously masterminded by Elder Zhang. I did this to force elder Zhang out from behind ye Zao.”
