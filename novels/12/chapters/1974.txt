“After that.., mi Chen continued, “Ziteng! You can eat whatever you want, but you can’t say whatever you want! I didn’t say anything because you’re a patient. It doesn’t matter what you say about me! “But Xu Yao isn’t just your girlfriend. She’s also pregnant. Have you thought about how she feels when you talk about her like that?” ”

Mi Chen’s words were focused on two words.

Patient.

“He ziteng was a patient. When he got into a car accident, he injured his brain. How could he believe his words so easily? ”

“After hearing what Mi Chen said, the expressions of the he family’s parents changed. ”

“Actually, what Mi Chen said made sense. ”

“After all, he had just recovered. It was normal for him to be a little confused. ”

Mi Chen was just a doctor. How could she be so capable to kill someone and cause a car accident?

The He family’s parents felt that he ziteng was talking in his sleep.

“He ziteng looked at Mi Chen. “Mi Chen, how dare you say that you didn’t cause my car accident? How dare you say that you have nothing to do with Xu Yao?” ”

“”The more you say it, the more ridiculous it gets!”A look of anger gradually appeared on Mi Chen’s gentle face, she continued, “You have to be responsible for everything you say. You said that I was the one who caused the car accident and that I had a relationship with Xu Yao. You even said that the child in Xu Yao’s stomach was mine. Do you have any evidence? “Where is your evidence?” ”

Could the court convict him based on just one sentence from he ziteng?

Impossible!

“Therefore, no matter how much he ziteng said, it was just slander. ”

“He ziteng continued, “Mi Chen, I heard everything! When I was unconscious, the words you said to Xu Yao were the best evidence!” ”

“”Ziteng, don’t be too excited. Your condition has just improved. If you are too emotional, it won’t do you any good!”Mi Chen tried her best to speak in a calm tone, “Nothing happened between Xu Yao and me. You said that you heard me talking to Xu Yao while you were unconscious! “Ziteng, even you yourself said that you were in a coma at that time. That was just your imagination! “I have nothing to do with Xu Yao’s Innocence!” ”

Mi Chen was calm now.

It was as if he was really innocent with Xu Yao.

“At that time, he ziteng was in a coma. Even the Doctor said that there was no hope for he ziteng to wake up at that time. ”

“Even if it wasn’t a figment of his imagination, it was just a dream that he ziteng had. ”

What could a dream mean?

“He ziteng narrowed his eyes, “You can understand that it was all my imagination, but how do you explain Xu Yao’s stomach? “Mi Chen, my parents treated you well. I didn’t expect you to be an ingrate! “Not only did you want to harm me, but you also wanted to lay your hands on my parents after I was killed! “Are you even human? !” ”

He ziteng was extremely heartbroken!

“If he hadn’t heard it with his own ears, he wouldn’t have believed that Mi Chen and Xu Yao would betray him. ”

“Luckily, there was still Xu Yao’s belly. ”

“Xu Yao had been in cahoots with Mi Chen for so long, so the evil child in her belly was definitely Mi Chen’s! ”

How could mi chen really make Xu Yao pregnant with his child.

The reason why Mi Chen was so ruthless to him was because of Xu Yao’s belly.

He was afraid that he would see through something after the child was born.

“”Good! Since uncle and aunt are both here today, let’s do an appraisal together and let science tell you who the child is! Let reality tell you whether this is your imagination or not!” Mi Chen continued, “But ziteng, I also want to tell you that the human heart will turn cold! Doing a bone piercing appraisal will also affect the child. You’d better think it through!” ”

“Are you feeling guilty?”He ziteng looked at Mi Chen.

It must be Mi Chen who was feeling guilty!

“Otherwise, he wouldn’t have stopped him from doing the appraisal. ”

“”Alright, I understand what you mean.”Mi Chen nodded and looked at Xu Yao. “You are the child’s mother. What do you think?” ”

“Xu Yao bit her lip and looked at he ziteng with a pitiful look, “Ziteng, do you really not believe me? Just because of a dream and a fantasy, you think I betrayed you, and you suspect our baby? Is Our relationship so fragile?” ”

“”Xu Yao, what time is it? You are still acting!”He ziteng clenched his fists. His eyes were full of anger. He wanted to crush Xu Yao to death. ”

“However, his rationality told him that he couldn’t. ”

He couldn’t.

“Xu Yao immediately raised three fingers, “Ziteng, I can swear to the heavens that I have never been betrayed by you. I am carrying our baby! “If you don’t believe me, can you wait for the baby to be born before doing the appraisal? “I heard that many people miscarried because of the wrong amnio! This is our first child, ziteng, are you really willing to give it up?” ”
