Chapter 120: 078: an unknown past! Brother Ze, your biological mother might be in Yun Jing! 6

“Sir,”the assistant stepped forward, “There’s no need to investigate this matter.”

Song Shiyu turned to look at his assistant. “You Know About It?”

Such a major incident in the MU family was known to the entire city.

However, Song Shiyu was an exception.

He had never liked to gossip, so he knew nothing about external matters.

The assistant told Song Shiyu in detail about the Mu family carrying the wrong child.

In the dark night, song Shiyu pressed his temples, and the dark night covered the man’s face with a mysterious veil. “In other words, the Miss MU from before was not the real miss mu?”

“Yes,”the assistant continued, “The Miss Ye who came tonight is the Miss Mu from before.”

Miss Mu was not the real miss mu...

Ye Zhuo was the Miss Mu from before.

It was obvious that he had not expected this.

Song Shiyu narrowed his eyes and turned around to walk into the room.

The assistant followed his footsteps.

Song Shiyu took off his silver wristwatch and placed it casually on the table. He turned around to look at the assistant. “You can get off work first. I’ll call you if there’s anything.”

“Alright.”

The assistant left the room.

Song Shiyu went to the bathroom and prepared to take a shower.

His white shirt was taken off, revealing the man’s muscular chest. Under his eight-pack ABS, there was a beautiful mermaid line.

This figure was something that even a professional fitness trainer could not compare to.

The only flaw was that the man’s back was full of scars of all sizes.

Although it was old.

These scars were still very clear.

There was a thin red rope hanging around his neck, and on the red rope was a peach pit to keep him safe.

However, this kind of peach pit to keep him safe was mostly worn by children under the age of 10.

Perhaps it was because of the age, the peach pit had been polished until it was shiny.

The red rope’s color was not bright anymore.

But it was clean.

It had been half an hour since he came out of the bathroom after taking a shower. Song Shiyu was wearing a black silk nightgown, and his abdominal muscles were faintly discernible under the thin silk cloth.

This was a scene that made one’s blood boil.

Although his hair was wet, song Shiyu had no intention of taking out a hair dryer. He sat directly in front of the desk and began to draw.

He had been injured when he was young.

As a result, his memory was also intermittent. Occasionally, he would suddenly recall a certain fragment, and he would need to record the flash of images through drawing.

Soon, a piece of paper was filled with drawings.

In a dark room.

A thin and weak-looking youth was squatting in a corner. His eyes were empty, and his skin, which was exposed in the air, was covered with wounds of all sizes.

A little girl was standing in front of him.

She was bent over, as if she was talking to him.

“Big Brother is not afraid. It Won’t hurt if I help you.”

In this darkness, she was his only salvation.

Song Shiyu stared at the painting, and his eyes were filled with boundless viciousness. It was not until he took out the small peach pit hanging on his neck and rubbed it in his hands that most of the viciousness in his eyes disappeared.

The next day. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Old Master Yang came to the ye family with bags of gifts.

Although ye Zhuo had already agreed to the marriage proposal.

But this matter still had to be done through ye Zhuo’s parents.

This was the most basic form of respect.

After coming to the Ye family, Old Master Yang found out that ye Zhuo was born into a single-parent family. There was only one mother and one uncle in the family.

“Old Master Yang, please take a seat. The house is simple and crude. Please don’t mind it.”Ye Shu invited Old Master Yang to sit down.

Ye Sen quickly went to pour tea for Old Master Yang.

Old Master Yang smiled and said, “Mother Zao, what are you talking about! The house is so warm, how can I mind it!”

These words were not against his heart.

Although the ye family was small, there were only three bedrooms and one living room, but it was very warm inside.

One look and one could tell that the owner of the house was definitely a good wife and mother.

Although old master Yang lived in a manor, it was only an ice-cold manor. There was no warmth in it at all.

“Please have some tea.”Ye Sen brought the brewed tea to Old Master Yang.

“Thank you.”Old Master Yang picked up the tea and continued, “Why don’t I see Burning?”

Ye Shu said, “Zao Zao went out for a run. He should be back soon.”

Old Master Yang nodded and then said the purpose of this trip.

Because ye Zao had already told ye Shu and ye Sen about this when he came back last night, the two of them were not surprised at all.

Ye Shu smiled and said, “Old Master Yang, our Zao Zao has never had a grandfather since he was young. You want to be his godgranddaughter. This means that you and your grandson are fated. It’s also our family’s good fortune. As a mother, I’m more than happy!”
