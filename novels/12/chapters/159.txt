Chapter 160: 085: Lovely Old Mrs. Cen, my granddaughter-in-law is the most beautiful woman in the world! 4

However, she was disgusted by men who cheated even after having a family!

It was simply intolerable!

“No! No! Her mother can not know about this.”An lizi continued, “Zhuozhuo, is there a way to not let her mother know, but also to make her father turn back?”

An Lizi didn’t want to see her mother suffer any mishaps.

On the other hand, she also wanted to make her father back.

She also wanted to keep this happy family.

Ye Zhuozhuo thought for a moment, “Then let your neighbor’s sister go and expose this layer of window paper to her father! Since he’s so Shameless, then why is your neighbor’s sister still caring about his face? If this man has a sense of responsibility, he will definitely turn back and break off the relationship with that third party outside!”

An Lizi’s eyes lit up. Perhaps this method really could work!

Her father loved her so much, and he loved this family so much. He would definitely turn back.

After school, an Lizi rushed home in the evening, intending to have a chat with an dongliang.

However, after searching around the supermarket, she still could not find an dongliang. An Lizi could only look for Xia Xiaoman. “Mom, Where’s My Dad?”

Coincidentally, one of the cashiers took a leave of absence today. Xia Xiaoman was at the front desk. “Your dad went to buy some goods.” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Buy some goods!

......

Buy some goods again!

An Lizi’s eyes flashed with a cold smile.

“Why are you looking for your dad?”Xia Xiaoman asked.

“Nothing much.”An Lizi carried her school bag and went upstairs.

It was not until 10 pm that an Dongliang returned home.

An Lizi could clearly smell the scent of perfume on an Dongliang’s body. “Dad, I have something to tell you. Let’s go downstairs.”

An Dongliang took off his coat and smiled. “What is it? Why do you have to go downstairs?”

Although he said so, he still followed an lizi downstairs.

It was early spring, and the cold wind was blowing.

An dongliang said, “Lizi, what do you have to say that your mother can’t Hear?”

An Lizi raised her head and looked at an Dongliang. She did not beat around the bush and said directly, “It’s about you, Dad. Did you meet someone outside?”

An Dongliang’s expression changed.

“Don’t deny it. I have evidence.”An Lizi took out the photo she took last time.

“Lizi, I... I’m sorry...”an Dongliang did not know how to describe his feelings at this moment. No one could understand the feeling of being caught cheating by his own daughter.

No wonder an Lizi was acting so strangely these few days.

It was because of this matter.

An Lizi almost shouted it out, “Don’t apologize to me, you should apologize to Mom! Mom worked so hard every day! She sacrificed so much for this family! She was like a nanny waiting on you! Do you think you can let mom down by doing this? Don’t you want our family anymore?”

An Lizi’s eyes turned red again when she thought of her mother.

An Dongliang panicked when his daughter questioned him like this. He said with red eyes,

“I’m sorry, I’m sorry, Lizi. I’m sorry for you, I’m sorry for your mother, and I’m even more sorry for our family! Please don’t tell your mother about this, okay? I’ll cut off all contact with that woman immediately!”

“Are you serious?”An Lizi raised her head and looked at an Dongliang.

An dongliang immediately stretched out three fingers. “I’m serious, I swear! If I Lie, I’ll be struck by lightning!”

An lizi heaved a sigh of relief. Her father still had her and her mother in his heart. “Then, I’ll give you this chance. I hope you can remember what you said tonight.”

“Thank you, Lizi!”An Dongliang hugged an Lizi. “I’ll make it up to your mother in the future. Your mother is a good woman. I’ve let her down.”

After this day, an Dongliang seemed to have changed. He no longer left early or returned late. He even helped Xia Xiaoman with the housework.

The smile on Xia Xiaoman’s face was obviously much bigger than usual.

An Lizi also returned to her usual smiling face.

...

Soon, a week had passed.

Today was Saturday.

The weather was very good. The temperature had changed from minus one degree before the year to eighteen or nineteen degrees.

The weeping willows by the river had also sprouted new buds.

A breeze blew, bringing with it the fragrance of an unknown flower.

Ye Zhuo had made an appointment with Lin Sha yesterday to tutor her today, so she had just finished eating when she set off from home to the Lin family.

There was a distance between Lin Shasha’s house and the Ye family’s.

However, the weather was good today, so ye Zao didn’t want to take a taxi. He was going to walk there and exercise at the same time.

Bathing in the spring sunshine, he felt especially relaxed.

There were many people on Saturday.
