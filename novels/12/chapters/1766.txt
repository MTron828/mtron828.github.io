“Dr. Cara had been kidnapped before. Although he was a little worried, he was not that nervous. However, there was one thing that made Dr. Cara very curious. ”

“He was accompanied by dozens of bodyguards, and there were three or four assistants sitting outside the door. The research room was heavily guarded. How did this person get in? ”

He didn’t even hear the sound of the door opening

“Dr. Cara continued, “Don’t worry. As long as you can keep me safe, I’ll pay you whatever you want.” ”

“The Man didn’t say anything, but the corners of his mouth curled up slightly. ”

“The next second, he increased the strength in his hand, and the sharp tip of the knife directly pierced Dr. Cara’s throat. ”

Dr. Cara’s eyes were wide open.

He had never thought that the other party would directly kill him!

“After taking care of Dr. Cara, the man cleaned up the blood on the ground and injected a needle into Dr. Cara’s body. ”

“Finally, he moved Dr. Cara’s body to a chair and sat down in the position where he was looking at the computer. After that injection, Dr. Cara’s body quickly became stiff, like a marionette, it could be placed in any position. ”

“So, it seemed that Dr. Cara was no different from usual. ”

“After doing this, the man climbed up the wall and crawled away through the air-conditioning vent. ”

“When Tina called Dr. Cara again, there was no one there to answer. ”

“No one answered Dr. Cara’s call, which made Tina feel relieved. ”

“She was very afraid of Dr. Cara. If she said the wrong thing at such a critical time and made Dr. Cara unhappy, it would be over! ”

On the other side.

“After Feng Shujing’s old lady’s video was exposed on the Internet, the people all went to the cemetery to pay their respects to the old lady. ”

“When the old lady was buried, only ye Zhuo was handling the funeral arrangements, and there were only two people, including Cen Shaoqing. ”

It was very lonely and lonely.

“Now, a group of people were sending the old lady off. The snow-white chrysanthemums extended from the old lady’s tombstone to the roadside, causing the old man guarding the cemetery to sigh with emotion. ”

“After her death, there were still so many people who came to send her off. The old lady’s life had not been in vain! ”

“In addition, the netizens also spontaneously uploaded videos to the American sound platform to apologize to Ye Zhuo. ”

“”Hello, everyone. I’m Netizen 123, a blockhead. I’m here to apologize to Dr. YC, and also to apologize for my words and actions.” ”

“”Hello, everyone, I’m...” ”

“For a moment, the American sound short video was full of apology videos. ”

The American sound short video immediately launched a hashtag # International Apology Day.

“The netizens were all at the bottom of the video, pointing to the initiator of this incident, Dr. Cara. ”

Dr. Cara’s side did not respond.

“Looking at the comments on the Internet, Dr. Cara’s assistant was very anxious. ”

“Now that all the blame was pointed at Dr. Cara, if Dr. Cara did not come out and make a statement, it would be difficult to appease the public’s anger. ”

“The assistant wanted to go to Dr. Cara, but he didn’t dare. ”

“At such a critical time, if he went to Dr. Cara, wouldn’t he be shooting himself in the foot? ”

“But if he didn’t go and look for Dr. Cara, the situation would get worse, and Dr. Cara would hold him responsible. ”

What should he do now?

“If he stuck out his head, it would be a knife, and if he retracted his head, it would be a knife. ”

“After hesitating for a long time, the assistant finally decided to knock on the door of Dr. Cara’s office. ”

“Knock, Knock, Knock ”

There was no response from inside. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“The assistant mustered up his courage and knocked again, but there was still no response. ”

What was going on?

Could it be that Dr. Cara was not inside?

“The assistant frowned slightly, but he did not see Dr. Cara go out either. ”

The assistant did not dare to force his way in either. He turned around and went to the secretary’s office.

“Eva.”

“The secretary, Eva, walked over. “What’s the matter?” ”

“The assistant continued, “Did Dr. Cara go out?” ”

“No.”Eva shook her head. “He’s been in the office the whole time.”

“He’s been in the office the whole time? Then why didn’t he respond when I knocked on the door?”The assistant asked.

“Eva continued, “He should be resting. Is there anything you need from the Doctor?” ”

The assistant nodded.

“”Then I’ll go with you to take a look,”Eva said. ”

“”Sorry to trouble you, Eva.” ”

“Eva smiled and said, “It’s my pleasure.” ”

“The two of them walked to the door of the office. Eva reached out and knocked on the door. “Dr. Cara, are you inside?” ”

The result was the same as before. There was still no answer from inside.

Eva frowned slightly.

Where did he go?

Could he have fallen asleep?

There seemed to be something wrong.

“The assistant looked at Eva and continued, “Do you think we should take the key to open the door and have a look?” ”

“Eva said, “Wait a minute, I’ll see.” ”
