“Fang yinyue smiled and said, “Mom, look at what you’re saying. Although Shuyi’s actions are a little inappropriate, she is my niece after all, Yueyue’s cousin. How can I not treat her as my own niece?” ”

“At this point, Fang yinyue paused, then, she said, “Shuyi’s matter has happened. As an aunt, I’m also very sad, but it has already happened! The other party is Cen Wu Ye. What can an ordinary commoner like us do? “Mother, don’t be anxious. Our children and grandchildren will have their own blessings. I believe that Shuyi will definitely be fine.” ”

Fang yinyue’s words made Old Lady Lin Speechless.

“What about Sanzhu?”Old Lady Li asked.

“”He has something to do,”Fang yinyue replied. ”

Busy?

“It was the new year, what was there for him to be busy with! ”

He was hiding on purpose and didn’t dare to see her!

“Where did he go to be busy?”Old Lady Li asked.

Fang yinyue shook her head. “I’m not too sure.”

“Old Lady Li frowned slightly and didn’t say anything more. She continued, “I’ll go back to second brother’s place first. When Sanzhu comes back, tell him to go to second brother’s place.” ”

“Okay.”Fang yinyue nodded.

Old Lady Li Glanced at Fang yinyue and turned to leave.

“Seeing Old Lady Li’s back outside the door, Li Yueyue heaved a sigh of relief. She lowered her voice and said, “Mom, where did dad go?” ”

“Fang yinyue smiled and said, “He’s in the house.” ”

“”In the house?”Li Yueyue asked doubtfully, “Then you just said that he wasn’t Here?” ”

“Fang yinyue said, “If I didn’t say that, would your grandmother be able to leave? ?”She wasn’t Ye Zhuo, so she could directly make old madam Li doubt her life! ”

Li Yueyue sighed.

She didn’t know when this matter would pass.

“Old Madam Li had just returned when Li Erzhu asked, “Mom, how is it? What did fifth Master Cen Say?” ”

Old Mrs. Li’s expression was very bad. She pursed her lips and did not say anything.

“Seeing this, Linda frowned and said, “Mom, can’t you go in person? Fifth Cen didn’t even give you face?” ”

“Old Mrs. Li said, “Don’t worry, you two. Don’t worry. I will definitely handle it.” ”

“The matter was between Li Sanzhu and his wife. If the husband and wife appeared, they would definitely be able to settle it! ”

Perhaps the way ye Zhuo treated her was Fang yinyue’s fault. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Otherwise, she was already so old, so ye Zhuo wouldn’t have disrespected her so much! ”

“How are you going to handle it?”Li Erzhu asked.

“”Don’t worry about it.”Old madam Li continued, “In any case, I definitely can’t let Shuyi go to jail!”Even if Fang yinyue and Li Yueyue were to go to jail, she couldn’t let Li Shuyi go. ”

Who Was Li Shuyi?

The hope of the entire Li family!

“Seeing old madam Li like this, Li Erzhu heaved a sigh of relief. “Okay, mom, I understand.” ”

Time passed very quickly.

“At two o’clock in the afternoon, Ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing set out to return to the capital. ”

“Li Sanzhu, Fang yinyue, and Li Yueyue’s family of three sent them to the airport. ”

“Li Sanzhu said, “Fifth master, Miss Ye, if the two of you didn’t treat us well during this trip, please bear with us!” ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “Uncle, you’re too polite. You and Auntie are welcome to visit the capital anytime. When the time comes, I’ll be the host.” ”

“”Okay, okay, okay. We’ll definitely go,”Li Sanzhu said. ”

“Fang yinyue got someone to prepare two suitcases and then said, “Miss Ye, these two suitcases are filled with the local specialties of our grassland. Fifth Master, please take them back and share them with your relatives.” ”

“”Thank you, Auntie. Then we won’t stand on ceremony,”ye Zao said. ”

“Fang yinyue smiled and said, “It’s just a small token of our appreciation. There’s no need to stand on ceremony! As long as you don’t mind it, it’s fine. You must come and play often in the future.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“Li Yueyue held ye Zao’s hand reluctantly. “Da Zao Zao, then we can only see each other at the beginning of school!” ”

“”Okay, see you when school starts.”Ye Zao leaned forward and hugged Li Yueyue. ”

“Seeing the two of them walk to the boarding gate, Li Sanzhu and Fang yinyue, the family of three, finally left the airport. ”

“Forty minutes later, the family of three returned to the villa. ”

“The butler said, “Sir, the old lady has already asked someone to rush them twice.” ”

“Hearing this, Li Sanzhu felt his scalp go numb, but he could not avoid this kind of thing. “Okay, I got it.” ”

“After saying that, Li Sanzhu turned to look at Fang yinyue. “Then I’ll go over first.” ”

“You go ahead.”Fang yinyue nodded.

“Li Yueyue said, “Dad, be careful.” ”

“Okay.”

“Soon, Li Sanzhu came to Li Erzhu’s side. ”
