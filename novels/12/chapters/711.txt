Translator: 549690339

“When Li Shang saw ye Zao, he was stunned for a moment.”

“If song Chenyu had not taken the initiative to introduce ye Zao, he would have thought that he was hallucinating.”

He did not expect song Chenyu and ye Zao to know each other. He did not expect to see ye Zao in this club.

President Ye?

This call of President ye not only stunned Cen Yuyan.

Even song Chenyu was stunned.

Who Was Li Shang calling President Ye?

Ye Zao?

Ye Zao was President Ye?

Wasn’t Ye Zao a live streamer under President Li?

When did she become President Ye?

Did Li Shang get the wrong person?

Song Chenyu frowned without leaving a trace. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Ye Zao smiled slightly. “Uncle Li.”

“Li Shang and Lin Jincheng were about the same age, so it was reasonable for ye Zao to call him Uncle Li.”

“Li Shang looked at song Chenyu and said very formally, “Miss Song, let me introduce you. This is the real boss of our company, President Ye. I’m just President Ye’s partner.””

“Song Chenyu asked him to take care of Ye Zhuo, so how could Li Shang still stand firm?”

“Although ye Zhuo was young and always called Li Shang as Uncle Li, Li Shang never treated her as a little girl.”

A boss was a boss.

“Hearing Li Shang’s introduction, Song Chenyu was stunned.”

Ye Zhuo was the boss of world of Xing?

Li Shang was just a partner?

Did she hear wrongly?

“Song Chenyu had originally wanted to introduce Li Shang to ye Zhuo, but never did she expect things to turn out this way. Ye Zhuo had actually become Li Shang’s boss. She was extremely depressed, but she still maintained a smile, she said in surprise, “I didn’t expect Miss Ye to be the boss of the world. You’re really young and promising!””

“Song Chenyu was, after all, from the entertainment industry. Although she found it very difficult to accept this fact, there was not a single trace of abnormality on her face.”

“Ye Zao’s eyebrows remained the same, and his tone was shallow. “Miss Song, you flatter me.””

“Old Mrs. Cen walked in front of Ye Zao and looked at Song Chenyu, she raised her chin and said, “Of course! My granddaughter-in-law is not young and promising. Who is young and promising? Do you really think that any Tom, Dick, or Harry can become the CEN family’s daughter-in-law? !””

Ye Zao was so outstanding.

“As a grandmother, Old Mrs. Cen was also honored!”

“If it were not for her, would cen Shaoqing have married such an outstanding wife?”

She could see through song Chenyu’s tricks.

“Song Chenyu only wanted to use the fact that she knew Li Shang to make a name for herself in front of ye Zao. However, she never expected that ye Zao was the boss of the world!”

This face slap was too exciting!

Old Mrs. Cen’s indifferent words turned into a loud slap on song Chenyu’s face.

A cat or dog?

She was a cat or dog?

Although song Chenyu knew that old Mrs. Cen did not like her.

“But she had thought that in old Mrs. Cen’s heart, she was a nobody!”

Everything in the world could not escape the law of fragrance.

She was waiting for the day old Mrs. Cen called her a nobody’s granddaughter-in-law!

The others in the room were also stunned.

They had only heard that Cen Shaoqing had a girlfriend.

But they did not know that Cen Shaoqing’s girlfriend was ye Zhuo.

“Moreover, looking at Old Madam Cen’s appearance, she was very satisfied with Ye Zhuo. Otherwise, she would not have announced that ye Zhuo was her granddaughter-in-law in front of so many people.”

Song Chenyu had originally invited these people to see ye Zhuo lose face.

Who would have thought that the person who lost face in the end would instead be her? She was a superstar that was held up by the entire entertainment industry. When had she ever suffered such grievance?

“Song Chenyu suppressed his anger and said with a smile, “Old Madam is right. Miss ye is graceful and graceful, and Zhong Lingyuxiu is indeed not someone that ordinary people can compare to.””

Old Madam Cen looked at Song Chenyu.

Little Lotus.

She was quite calm.

“She was just short of naming song Chenyu as a nobody, but song Chenyu could still smile and praise ye Zao.”

His skin was thick enough!

It could be said that he was at the corner of the city wall.

“He didn’t have the looks of a vixen, yet he was trying to seduce people by copying other vixens.”

He really overestimated himself.

Did song Chenyu think that she was an old fool?

“With a good grandmother like her in China, this fish wouldn’t be able to succeed!”

Old Mrs. Cen snorted coldly.

“Cen Yuyan walked over with a smile. “Grandmother, Zao Zao, Chenyu, we’re here to play today, so don’t just talk. Sit down first.”Cen Yuyan was also angry.”

“She was clearly here to look for trouble for Song Chenyu today, but she didn’t expect the limelight to be stolen by ye searing.”

No.

She still had to help song Chenyu look for trouble.

“Cen Yuyan narrowed her eyes, thinking about how to help song Chenyu look for trouble.”
