Ye Zhuo took the test results from Gu decing.

“The results showed that there were a total of 23 medicinal herbs in the medicine that old Mrs. Lin usually drank, and three of them were addictive. ”

“Old Mrs. Lin’s cough was caused by these three medicinal herbs. As long as the medicine was stopped, Old Mrs. Lin would cough non-stop for a long time. In serious cases, she would even cough up blood. ”

“This medicine was not only addictive, but if taken for a long time, it would also cause damage to the body. ”

Old Lady Lin had been drinking it for more than ten years.

One could almost imagine how much damage her body had suffered.

“Ye Zhuo frowned slightly. At first, she only suspected that there was something wrong with the health-preserving soup that Feng Qianhua gave Old Lady Lin. She did not expect that there was really something wrong with the health-preserving soup! ”

She had drugged three kinds of poisonous drugs at once. Feng Qianhua was really ruthless!

“Madam Lin was usually closer to Feng Qianhua and her daughter than family. If it were anyone else, they would not have been able to do it. ”

She wondered how madam Lin would react after finding out about this.

“Ye Zhuo put away the test results and looked up at Gu Dening. “Sister dening, thank you so much.” ”

“”Miss Ye, you’re Too Kind.”Gu dening smiled and said, “If there’s nothing else, I’ll go back first.” ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Follow me to the house to have a cup of tea before leaving.” ”

“Gu dening shook her head and smiled. “I still have some small matters to attend to, so I won’t go in. I’ll disturb you another day.” ”

“”Alright then.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “Sister dening, drive carefully on the road.” ”

“”Yes, I will. Goodbye, Miss Ye.”Gu De Ning waved at ye Zhuo. ”

“After watching Gu de Ning get into the car, Ye Zhuo turned around and went back. ”

“After returning to the bedroom, Ye Zhuo began to prepare his luggage. ” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

She planned to return to Yun Jing for a while.

“At night, Ye Shu came back. ”

“Ye Zhuo poured a glass of water for ye Shu. “Mom, I plan to return to Yun Jing soon.” ”

Return to Yun Jing?

Ye Shu took the cup and frowned slightly. “Didn’t we agree to go back in the first month?”

“Ye Zhuo said, “I have some things to take care of when I go back this time.”The test results of the nourishing soup had already come out. The main purpose of Ye Zhuo’s return this time was to take care of Xu Lanyue’s matters. ”

“After all, Xu Lanyue was the person who provided all the conveniences to Aunt Zhang and Feng Qianhua. ”

Xu Lanyue was also the person who had swapped her with Mu Yourong.

All of this was related to Xu Lanyue.

“She had to find Xu Lanyue and clarify everything in front of Aunt Zhang and Feng Qianhua, so that these people would pay the corresponding price for their actions! ”

“They had done something bad, and they still wanted to get away with it? ”

Impossible!

“Ye Shu knew that ye Zao had his own little secret, so she did not ask what was going on. However, ye Zao went back alone, so ye Shu was a little worried. “Why don’t Mom go back with you?” ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “There’s no need to go through so much trouble. You’re quite busy now, and the restaurant can’t do without people. Besides, you can’t help much when you go back. I can go back alone!” ”

“It was the end of the year. During this period of time, Ye Shu’s restaurant was very busy. ”

“After saying that, ye Zao continued, “And it’s not my first time going on a long trip. Are you still worried?” ”

“Ye Shu continued, “Zao Zao, when will you go back?” ”

“Ye Zao said, “I’ll go to the school tomorrow to let them know. I’ll probably go back the day after tomorrow.” ”

“Ye Shu nodded and continued, “Then I’ll prepare some local specialties in the capital. You Go to Shasha’s house and send my regards to your Aunt Lian and uncle Lin on my behalf.” ”

“Okay.”

“The next day, Ye Zhuo went to the school to ask for leave from the counselor. ”

“Ye Zhuo’s performance was usually very good. Even if he asked for leave, he would not fail the course. Moreover, this person was a doctor in the science and technology field and was the face of the capital university. Therefore, the counselor very happily approved ye Zhuo’s leave request. ”

“Thank you.”Ye Zhuo took the leave request from the counselor with both hands.

“”It’s my pleasure.”In front of ye Zao, the counselor was a little reserved. ”

“After all, this person came to school just to go through the motions. ”

“Ever since she found out about ye Zao’s status in the science and technology world, the counselor did not dare to treat ye Zao as a student anymore. ”

“However, ye Zao did not put on any airs. ”

“Even if she had already made a name for herself in the science and Technology World, she did not act high and mighty. She was very humble in front of her teachers and classmates. ”

“Therefore, the counselor had always admired ye Zhuo very much. ”

“As soon as she came out of the office, Ye Zhuo received a call from CEN Shaoqing. “Hello.” ”

“”Leader, are you in school?”Cen Shaoqing’s voice came from the other end of the phone. ”
