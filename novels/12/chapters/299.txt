Chapter 300: 103: The Wise Brother Ze, the Old Lady Cen, the King of tricks! 2”

Translator: 549690339

Ye Shu was a mistress.

A shameless mistress!

B * Tch!

She was clearly Lin Jincheng’s favorite person.

“Yet, Ye Shu insisted on interfering. ”

Lin Ze raised his head to look at Feng Qianhua. “Do you think I’ll believe your one-sided Words?” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Even though he didn’t know what had happened back then.

Lin Ze still believed that his mother wasn’t that kind of person.

Definitely not.

“Feng Qianhua looked at Lin Ze, “Ah Ze, whether you want to believe it or not, this is all true! “But I don’t blame your mother. I never blame her! “Because love is something that can’t be controlled. She fell in love with your father and was beautiful. Everyone says that the flowers in the house don’t have the fragrance of wild flowers. Your father was a normal man after all, so what happened after that was only natural.” ”

“At this point, Feng Qianhua gathered her emotions and continued: ”

“”But, what I did not expect was that your mother had clearly gotten your father, but she betrayed him! “I feel that your father is not worth it! “I also feel that our love is not worth it. In order to fulfill your mother and your father, I gave up our love to fulfill them! But your mother betrayed him! What she didn’t want, I treated like a treasure! Ah Ze! Do you understand how I Feel?” ”

Feng Qianhua spoke with sincerity.

Even her eyes were red.

She portrayed herself as a kind and generous person who sacrificed her love in order to help others.

“If it was anyone else, they would definitely believe it. ”

But Lin Ze did not believe it.

“Before he saw his mother with his own eyes, he would not believe anyone’s one-sided words. ”

Especially since this person was Feng Qianhua.

Someone like Feng Qianhua.

She would do anything to achieve her goal.

Lin Ze only cared about what he cared about. “Who is my mother?”

“I don’t know her name.”Feng Qianhua wiped away her tears. “Your father protected her too well. I didn’t even have the chance to know her. I only know that she exists!”

“Lin Ze continued to ask, “Where is she now?” ”

“Feng Qianhua said, “She’s dead.” ”

Feng Qianhua knew.

Only when Lin Ze knew that his biological mother was dead would he let down all his guard against himself.

The reason why Lin Ze had never accepted her was because he wanted to find his mother.

Now.

“Not only did Lin ze know that his biological mother was dead, but she was also a bad woman with a bad record. He would definitely be extremely disappointed with his biological mother. ”

“At this time, she could take advantage of the situation. ”

She had to let Lin Ze know.

The maternal love that he had been looking forward to.

Only she could give it!

Only she was worthy of being Lin Ze’s mother.

“Feng Qianhua looked at Lin Ze and continued, “Your mother died in a car accident while eloping with another man. It was a very tragic car accident. It was said that even her complete body was not found.” ”

Ye Shu deserved to die without a complete body!

Dismembered into thousands of pieces!

Feng Qianhua’s lowered eyes were filled with a sinister light.

Lin Ze did not speak.

There was no other expression on his face.

This was not the first time he had heard such words.

Old Mrs. Lin had said the same thing before.

“”Maybe this is the legendary retribution,”Feng Qianhua continued, “She stole my fiancé. Even the heavens can’t stand it anymore.” ”

“”Aren’t you the one who wants to steal my father from my mother?”Lin Ze looked up at Feng Qianhua. “You keep saying that my mother is already dead, but you’re so guilty that you don’t even dare to say my mother’s name!” ”

Guilty.

They were guilty!

If mother was really such a person…

Would Old Mrs. Lin have kept it a secret until now?

Lin Ze had grown up by Old Mrs. Lin’s side. He knew that old Mrs. Lin was a person with a very high social status. Old Mrs. Lin wasn’t even willing to befriend him and buttface.

Perhaps it was because his mother was born too young that Old Lady Lin looked down on her.

“”It’s not like that, Ah Ze! We don’t have a guilty conscience!”Feng Qianhua stood up with red eyes, “Your mother is really dead! Some people might as well be dead! If she wasn’t dead, wouldn’t she have come to look for you once in all these years? It’s said that mother and son are linked by heart. You miss her so much, but does she miss you? !” ”

This sentence was implying that ye Shu was not worthy of being Lin Ze’s mother.

Nineteen years.

Ye Shu had never fulfilled her responsibility as a mother for a single day!

She had not even come to look for Lin Ze.

She was not worthy at all!

“Feng Qianhua continued, “Ah Ze, I’m just feeling sorry for you. You Care so much about your mother, but there are some people who are not worthy of your care at all! “You’ve never had a mother since you were young. I’ve watched you grow up. “I really hope that you can treat me like your mother! “Don’t worry, I’ll love you as if you were my own son!” ”
