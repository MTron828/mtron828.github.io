“”Alright then,”ye Zhuo continued, “Get ready. We’ll set off tomorrow morning.” ”

“Alright.”

“Lin Ze had made quite a number of friends in Galaxy S over the past few days. If he was going back, he would definitely greet his friends. ”

“On the way back, he bumped into Bai Mo.. ”

“Out of courtesy, Lin ze greeted her politely, “Miss Bai.” ”

Bai Mo nodded. “Mr. Lin hasn’t returned yet?”

“Lin Ze continued, “I’m preparing to return tomorrow.” ”

“”Have a safe journey,”Bai Mo said. ”

“Thank you.”

“After Lin Ze left, Bai Yuanyuan, the female companion beside him, asked curiously, “Is this the Lin Ze you were telling me about?” ”

“Yes.”Bai Mo nodded slightly.

“He’s Miss Ye’s younger brother?”Bai Yuanyuan continued to ask.

“Yes.”Bai Mo continued to nod.

“Bai Yuanyuan continued, “He’s actually not bad-looking! He’s tall, handsome, and has a good temperament at critical moments! It’s hard to find such a man in the S Galaxy Now, right?” ”

“Lin Ze’s appearance was hard to describe. He had inherited the good genes of the Lin family. He was tall and had long legs. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be the campus belle of Beijing University. ”

He would only be able to blow up the streets if he walked out.

“He’s not bad-looking.”A regretful look appeared in Bai Mo’s eyes. “It’s a pity that his background is a little bad.”

Saying that it was a little bad was just a euphemism. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Actually, it was not a little bad at all! ”

“Apart from his good appearance, Lin Ze was completely useless. ”

Just the fact that he was an earthling was something that he could not compare to people from the s galaxy.

“If Lin Ze was the same as ye Han, Bai Mo would definitely agree. ”

Unfortunately.

No.

“Bai Yuanyuan continued, “But his sister is Miss Ye! Mo Mo, why don’t you consider it? I think he has a pretty good impression of you. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have come all the way here to greet you! “Miss Ye’s birth wasn’t good either. She even roamed around before, but she still became someone superior!” ”

“”He can’t be compared to Miss Ye.”Bai Mo shook her head, she continued, “The reason why Miss Ye was able to succeed was because Miss Ye was born in the s galaxy. Lin Ze was different. Lin Ze was just an ordinary person from the beginning to the end.” ”

“Lin Ze was the same age as ye Zao, and Ye Zao was already a well-known miss ye in changyue. ”

What was Lin Ze?

“When Ye Han introduced Lin Ze to her, he always started with ye Zao’s younger brother. ”

“Ye Zao was indeed powerful, but his sister was his sister. ”

Lin Ze couldn’t rely on ye Zao for his entire life.

“Hearing this, Bai Yuanyuan nodded. “That’s true.” ”

Different people would have different circumstances if they were born different.

The ugly duckling could become a white swan because it was a white swan.

An ordinary duck could transform into a white swan?

“”I just feel that it’s quite a pity,”Bai Yuanyuan continued, “It’s such a waste to be so handsome!” ”

“Although Bai Mo felt a little regretful, he was not at Bai Yuanyuan’s level. He smiled and said, “The s galaxy is so big. There are many men who are more outstanding than Lin Ze. It’s just that you didn’t notice.” ”

“Is that so?”Bai Yuanyuan asked back.

“”Of course it is,”Bai Mo continued, “You have to know that appearance is the most useless thing in this world!” ”

“Compared to Bai Yuanyuan, who had a love brain, Bai Mo was simply clear-headed. ”

She knew very well what she wanted.

“Right now, power was the most important thing to her! ”

Lin Ze could not give her what she wanted.

“Bai Yuanyuan continued, “What you said makes a little sense.” ”

“”You’ll find out in the future,”Bai Mo continued, “Love without power is just like loose sand on the side.” ”

Lin Ze only greeted Bai mo out of courtesy. He didn’t expect Bai Mo to make so much up in her head.

“Because he had other things to do in the afternoon, he couldn’t help but hurry up. At this moment, he suddenly bumped into someone. ”

Bang!

The other party’s book was knocked to the ground.

“I’m Sorry!”Lin Ze immediately squatted down to pick up the book.

“”It’s okay,”a very gentle female voice said. The other party also squatted down to pick up the book. ”

Lin Ze picked up the last book and handed it to her.

“”Thank you.”The girl took the book with both hands. Not only did she not feel angry because of the bump, but she was also very well-educated and neither angry nor angry. ”

“After saying that, the girl picked up the book and left. ”

“At this moment, Lin Ze found a brooch on the ground. ”

Lin Ze immediately chased after her. “Please Wait.”

“When the girl heard the sound, she stopped and looked back. “What’s Wrong?”? ”

Lin Ze jogged after her. “You dropped something.”

The girl looked down and realized that she had dropped her brooch. “Thank you.”

“”I should be the one apologizing. If I hadn’t been so Careless, your brooch wouldn’t have dropped.”Lin Ze returned the brooch to her. ”
