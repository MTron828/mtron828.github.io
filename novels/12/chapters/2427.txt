Cen Shaoqing:”...”why did he ask such a question.

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Let me ask you a question.” ”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing held the handle of the suitcase with one hand and caught up with Ye Zhuo. He reached out and grabbed ye Zhuo’s wrist.

Ye Zhuo looked at Cen Shaoqing. “Who was your goddess when you first fell in love?”

“”You,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “What I mean is, when you were in school during puberty, did you have a crush on anyone in Your Class?” ”

“No.”Cen Shaoqing’s expression was calm. “I remember you asking this question before.”

“Really?”Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly.

“CEN Shaoqing said, “I really didn’t. Didn’t Grandma Tell You? When other people first fell in love during puberty, I saw through the secular world.” ”

This was Cen Shaoqing’s true experience.

He saw through the secular world when he was 14 or 15 years old. He felt that life was too simple and meaningless.

“Day after day, year after year. ”

“This persistence lasted for more than 10 years. When he said this, Cen Shaoqing turned to look at Ye Zhuo. “Then I met you.” ”

“Up until now, Cen Shaoqing still remembered the scene at that time. ”

“At that time, he mistook his heartbeat for an illness and even looked for ye Zhuo to feel his pulse. ”

“Thinking of this, the corners of Cen Shaoqing’s mouth curled slightly. ”

“”What are you smiling about?”CEN Shaoqing continued, “I remembered the scene when I looked for your pulse. Actually, I had already fallen in love with you at that time, but I didn’t realize it myself.” ”

This sentence also evoked ye Zhuo’s memories.

“At that time, it was also the first time she had fallen in love with someone. Just like Cen Shaoqing, she thought that she had some rare illness. ”

“Am I the first person you fell in love with?”Cen Shaoqing looked at Ye Zao.

“Ye Zao was a little speechless and said, “I remember that you asked this question too.” ”

“”I want to ask again,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

Ye Zao nodded. “Yes.”

Cen Shaoqing did not say anything. He just held ye Zhuo’s hand tightly.

The two of them quickly arrived outside.

“The driver had already parked the car outside the door. When he saw the two of them walking over, the driver immediately opened the door and got out of the car. He went forward to receive the suitcase in Cen Shaoqing’s hand and said respectfully, “Fifth master, Miss Ye.” ”

Cen Shaoqing opened the back door and carefully placed his hand on the roof of the car. He held ye Zhuo’s waist. “Slow down.”

“Okay.”Ye Zao nodded slightly and walked into the back seat.

Cen Shaoqing also got into the car and sat beside ye Zao.

The speed of the car was neither fast nor slow.

“The Cen family had their own parking space in the airport and their own VIP access, so there was no need to line up in the hall. ”

The two of them arrived at the boarding gate without any obstruction.

“Nanhai was more than 3,000 kilometers away from the capital city, and it took about four hours by plane. ”

“The Cen family’s private plane was especially luxurious. There were movie theaters, game rooms, gyms, and everything. ”

“Because Cen Shaoqing did not eat dinner, the captain also prepared an exquisite dinner. ”

“After eating, Ye Zao put on his blindfold and began to rest. ”

“He was too tired during this period of time, so ye Zao quickly fell asleep. ”

“Cen Shaoqing sat next to Ye Zao. As long as he tilted his head slightly, he could see ye Zao’s sleeping face. ”

There were thousands of stars outside the window.

The person beside him was the one he loved the most.

This was the best thing in life.

Cen Shaoqing picked up the thin blanket and gently covered ye Zao’s body.

“She was a light sleeper, but she was completely immune to CEN Shaoqing. ”

“After covering her with the thin blanket, Cen Shaoqing leaned over slightly and planted a light kiss on her red lips. ”

“Just as Cen Shaoqing was about to raise his head, ye Zao suddenly stretched out his hand and hooked it around his neck, pulling it gently. ”

“Cen Shaoqing was stunned. Just as he was about to say something, his thin lips were blocked by someone. All his words were swallowed into his stomach at that moment. ”

His heart was racing.

One moment after another.

The atmosphere became delicate.

“After an unknown amount of time, Cen Shaoqing finally let go of her. He was slightly panting as he turned around and walked to the other side. ”

“Where are you going?”Ye Zao opened his mouth at this moment.

Ye Zao was also stunned when he opened his mouth.

“Her voice seemed to have changed a little, but it didn’t seem to have changed at all. ”

“I...”Cen Shaoqing cleared his throat. “I’m going...”

“Before he could finish his sentence, he was interrupted by Ye Zao. “Are you going to the bathroom?” ”

“It was a very plain sentence, but it made Cen Shaoqing’s pupils widen in an instant. ”

It was as if ye Zao had said something fierce.

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Mr. Cen, if I Were you, I might as well not bear it.” ”

“After saying that, ye Zao paused and continued, “Do You Dare?” ” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“How could a man’s dignity tolerate such a provocation? Cen Shaoqing directly stepped forward and pressed on her body. His phoenix-like eyes were dark and heavy, and his voice was extremely dangerous. “What do I not dare?” ”
