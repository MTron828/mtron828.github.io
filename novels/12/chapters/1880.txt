The desserts were made very delicately.

“Placed on the plate, they looked like blossoming hibiscus flowers. One look and one could tell that they were very delicious. ”

Ye Zao smiled and picked up a piece of dessert. “That’s more like it.”

“But the next second, the smile on his face froze at the corner of his mouth. ”

Because this dessert only looked good.

It was not sweet at all! Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“How is this not sweet?”Ye Zhuo looked at Cen Shaoqing.

“Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddha bead. “You can’t eat sweet anymore. You’re a doctor. You should know more about the dangers of eating sugar than I do, right?” ”

Things that go too far will always turn against each other.

Everything should be done in moderation.

“If the human body consumed too much sugar, it would cause many diseases. ”

“Ye Zhuo frowned slightly and finished the remaining ‘dessert’. Then he said, “Reach out and pinch it for me.” ”

Cen Shaoqing reached out his hand that was holding the Buddha bead.

Ye Zao pinched it hard.

“”Ouch! It Hurts!”Cen Shaoqing sucked in a breath of cold air. “Leader, you really pinched it!” ”

“What do you think!”Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly.

“Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips curved slightly. “Leader, as long as you’re happy.” ”

The two of them played around for a while before Cen Shaoqing got up and went to the bathroom.

Ye Zao looked at the clouds outside the window and suddenly felt a little sleepy.

“In order to go to the grassland to play, Ye Zao had been staying up almost every day to do experiments. ”

“Therefore, when Cen Shaoqing came back from the bathroom, ye Zao had already placed one hand on his head and leaned against the window to sleep. ”

“Seeing this scene, a faint smile slowly appeared on Cen Shaoqing’s face. ”

It was warm and affectionate.

“After standing for a while, Cen Shaoqing walked to ye Zao’s side, bent slightly, picked her up, carried her to the lounge, and gently placed her on the bed. ”

“His movements were gentle, as if he was afraid that he would accidentally wake her up. ”

“In a flash, Cen Shaoqing picked up the thin blanket and covered her. ”

Ye Zao’s breathing was shallow. The contrast between the way he slept and when he was awake was quite big.

Cen Shaoqing also felt a little sleepy as he watched. He gently laid beside her and slowly fell asleep.

Six hours. It was neither long nor short.

“It was already five hours later when ye Zhuo woke up again. When she opened her eyes, she saw the man lying beside her. ”

The man seemed to be in a deep sleep. He did not even realize that she had woken up.

Ye Zhuo looked at him quietly.

“His eyelashes were very long and thicker than a girl’s. From the looks of it, he looked like an eyelash demon. ”

Under the High Bridge of his nose was a thin lips that were as thin as paper. It was almost pursed into a line.

His skin was very white and contrasted with the Little Red Mole at the end of his eyes. It was so red that it was almost flirtatious. It also added a bit of coldness to his appearance.

“Even ye Zao, who was used to big scenes, could not help but be a little surprised when he saw him. ”

Why was a grown man so good-looking?

“Looking at the curly and thick long eyelashes, ye Zao could not help but reach out to touch them. His eyelashes gently swept across his fingertips, slightly itchy. ”

“The next second, the man who was sleeping soundly also woke up at this time. ”

He opened his eyes. His eyes were so deep that one could not see the bottom. They were so dark that they were heavy. There was no drowsiness of a person who had just woken up. It was as if they were going to suck him in.

“The next second, the back of Ye Zao’s head was held by a large hand. Then, his red lips were blocked by someone. The faint smell of tobacco entered his nose through every orifice. ”

Ye Zao was a little confused.

“She did not expect this person to suddenly wake up, nor did she expect him to suddenly make such a move. ”

“At that moment, CEN Shaoqing was like a ferocious beast that was hunting! ”

“Just when Ye Zao was in a daze, Cen Shaoqing had already pried open her teeth and attacked the city. The positions of the two of them also changed. From lying on the side, it became her down and him up. ”

The temperature gradually rose.

“As if sensing something pressing against her waist, ye Zao’s face turned red. ”

“The previous few times, Cen Shaoqing had put his phone in his pocket to fool her. However, Ye Zao was a medical student after all. With such a clear feeling, if she still did not know anything, then all her medical skills would have been wasted. ”

“Moreover, under the influence of Old Mrs. Cen, she had read a lot of romance novels during this period of time. Although she had never eaten pork, she had seen pigs run. ”

“At this moment, a sharp pain suddenly came from her lips. ”

“Then, a low and hoarse voice came from beside her ear. His lips fell on her ear and were burning hot. “What are you thinking about? Can’t you focus more when you kiss?” ”

“Thinking of what he had thought of, especially the feeling at his waist, ye Zhuo’s face became even redder. His heart was beating fast. He reached out and pushed Cen Shaoqing away. “I need to go to the bathroom.” ”
