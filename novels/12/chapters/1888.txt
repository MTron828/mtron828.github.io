Slander?

He was slander the autumn flute?

“The guard captain never expected ye Han to say this, much less that not only did ye Han not thank him, he even pointed his weapon at him! ”

Ye Han was treating him as an enemy.

The guard captain was speechless. How could there be someone like ye Han in this world.

He didn’t know what was good for him!

“He reminded Ye Han with good intentions, but ye Han treated him like this. ”

He was mentally ill. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

He really deserved to be targeted by autumn flute.

“”Brother, don’t be so agitated. I didn’t mean that...” ”

“Ye Han’s eyes revealed a fierce light, and he looked somewhat sinister. “Apologize to the eldest miss.” ”

“To Ye Han, autumn flute was the most important person in this world. ”

He absolutely wouldn’t allow anyone to slander autumn flute.

The autumn flute letting him get caught in the rain definitely had her intentions!

“The guard captain held his breath and wanted to directly beat ye Han to death. However, he could not defeat ye Han, so he could only say, “Good, good, good. Brother, I’ll apologize right away, apologize right away! Don’t be agitated, don’t be agitated.” ”

“Although the emei spike was a relatively ancient weapon, ye Han had played with such an ancient weapon to perfection. ”

The slightest carelessness would cause one’s soul to return to their hometown.

“Seeing the guard apologize to autumn flute with his own eyes, Ye Han was finally satisfied. He continued, “If I hear it a second time, don’t blame me for being merciless.” ”

“After saying this, Ye Han turned around and left. ”

The guard looked at Ye Han with a speechless expression.

“Only when Ye Han’s figure couldn’t be seen in the air did he say somewhat speechlessly, “There’s something wrong with your brain!” ”

“After changing his clothes and walking out of the changing room, the head guard was still very speechless. ”

“At this moment, the head guard of Area C walked up to him. Seeing Xu Qian like this, he asked with a smile, “Brother Xu, What’s Wrong? You look like you want to fight?” ”

“Xu Qian just happened to be full of bitterness and did not say anything. He put his arm around Zhou Wei’s shoulder and said in a low voice, “I suspect that there’s something wrong with Wu Han’s head.” ”

“What do you mean?”Zhou Wei asked curiously.

Xu Qian told Zhou Wei about what he had just experienced.

“Hearing that, Zhou Wei’s face was also filled with disbelief. ”

“”It seems that not only is he sick, but he’s also quite sick.”Speaking up to this point, Zhou Wei paused, then he said, “Maybe he has masochism. “Actually, I’ve long noticed that there’s something wrong with him. You See, his ability isn’t low. He could have carried the load by himself, but he didn’t do anything! “He’s willing to follow the eldest miss and silently give up!” ”

One had to know that ye Han was an existence that challenged a level three armored beast by himself.

“In the entire changyue country, other than ye Han, there was probably no one else who had the ability to do so. ”

“Xu Qian continued, “In that case, is he secretly in love with the eldest miss?”Only someone who truly loved someone would be willing to give up unconditionally. ”

“According to Ye Han’s performance, he was most likely secretly in love with Qiu Di. ”

“Zhou Wei shook his head. “Based on my experience, it doesn’t seem like it.” ”

“How do you know?”Xu Qian teased.

“”I’m serious,”Zhou Wei analyzed. “It’s impossible to hide the gaze of someone you like. Wu Han only looks at Miss Qiu di with respect. He doesn’t like her, much less love her.” ”

That’s right.

There was only respect.

“As someone who had been through this, Zhou Wei could tell that ye Han did not love autumn flute. ”

“Xu Qian had never been in a relationship before, nor had he liked anyone. He was a steel-like straight man. He continued, “Are you serious? Can you tell from the look in his eyes that he likes her?” ”

It seemed a little uncertain.

“”You’ll understand when you truly put your heart and soul into liking someone,”Zhou Wei said. ”

“Xu Qian nodded and continued, “That’s even stranger. You said that Wu Han doesn’t like miss, so why should he treat her so well?” ”

Ye Han following behind the autumn flute was simply overusing his talents!

“Zhou Wei shook his head. “There’s always room for error. Unless Wu Han says it himself, outsiders like us won’t be able to guess Wu Han’s intentions.”They just felt indignant for ye Han, ye Han didn’t have to stay at the autumn flute to suffer. ”

“A person who could destroy a level three armored beast on his own, what a pity! ”

“The two of them chatted as they walked, their words filled with pity for ye Han. ”

On the other side.

Ye Han changed his clothes and returned to his residence.

His residence was very simple.

Two bedrooms and a living room.

There was no furniture in the bedroom other than a bed.

“Ye Han stood in the living room, his temple suddenly felt a little swollen and painful. ”

“These days, he felt that something was wrong with him, but he did not know what was wrong with him. ”

“Just then, the communication device rang. ”
