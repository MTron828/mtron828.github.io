“Seeing the troubled look on Han Laoshan’s face, Zhao Xueyin continued, “Could it be that brother Han’s life is more important to uncle Han than the Financial Group?” ”

This sentence was a little harsh.

“Of course not!”Han Laoshan said immediately.

“Zhao Xueyin continued, “Then why is Uncle Han still hesitating?” ”

Han Laoshan frowned tightly.

“Although many Chinese doctors had mentioned the Bezoar Pill in front of him, he was not sure if this bezoar pill could really heal Han Dongliang. ”

“What if after he had promised Zhao Xueyin, this bezoar pill had no effect on Han Dongliang? Wouldn’t that be a futile effort? ”

“Most importantly, Old Master Ye had done him a favor back then. If it were not for Old Master Ye, he would not be where he is today. ”

“Now, asking him to vote for Zhao Xueyin in the election was no different from betraying him! ”

Han Laoshan had never done anything immoral in his life.

“Zhao Xueyin continued, “Uncle Han, there is only one chance. I hope you can take it. Big Brother Han is still so young and his life has just begun. It would be a pity if he died just like that.” ”

Han Dongliang was only 36 years old.

Han Laoshan had yet to see him get married and have children.

Han Laoshan’s eyebrows jumped when he heard this.

“When one reached middle age, the worst thing one could do was to lose one’s life. ”

“No matter what, Han Laoshan could not just watch his son leave. ”

“After a while, Han Laoshan looked up at Zhao Xueyin. “Xueyin, can you give me some time to think about it?” ”

“”Yes.”Zhao Xueyin nodded, then, she said, “As long as Uncle Han leads the shareholders to vote for me at the election, I will send the Bezoar Pill to Uncle Han’s house after the election. “I believe that Big Brother Han will definitely get better after eating the bezoar pill.” ”

“Okay.”Han Laoshan nodded.

“Zhao Xueyin continued, “Uncle Han, I have said my piece. I hope that you can think about it carefully. I still have something to do, so I’ll be leaving first.” ”

Han Laoshan stood up to send Zhao Xueyin off.

“After sending Zhao Xueyin off, Han Laoshan looked at her back and sighed. ”

“Elder Han.”The chauffeur walked to Han Laoshan’s side.

Han Laoshan collected his thoughts and turned to look at the chauffeur. “Let’s go to doctor Liu’s place.”

“Alright.”The chauffeur nodded.

Han Laoshan got into the car with the chauffeur.

Doctor Liu lived in the suburbs.

It took about an hour to reach the destination.

The driver went to the back seat to open the car door.

“Han Laoshan walked out of the car and said, “Xiao Yao, wait outside for a moment.” ”

“Okay.”

Doctor Liu was a famous godly doctor in Beijing.

“Since he was a godly doctor, he had a temper. ”

“”Old Mr. Han.”Just as Han Laoshan walked to the door, doctor Liu’s granddaughter, Liu Zixuan, walked out. ”

“”Miss Liu,”Han Laoshan continued, “Is doctor Liu at home?” ”

“Yes.”Liu Zixuan nodded. “Follow me in.”

“Thank you for your trouble.”Han Laoshan followed Liu Zixuan’s footsteps.

“The weather had not been good these few days. Doctor Liu was sitting in front of the stove to warm himself. When he heard footsteps, he raised his eyes. ”

“Liu Zixuan said, “Grandfather, old Mister Han is here.” ”

Doctor Liu nodded. “Take a seat.”

Han Laoshan came in front of doctor Liu and sat down.

“Doctor Liu immediately said, “Mr. Han, I have already said what I need to say. I really can’t do anything about your son’s illness.” ” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Han Laoshan’s expression was unclear. “Miracle Doctor Liu, didn’t you say last time that as long as you have an Gong’s bezoar pill, you can save my son?” ”

“When he heard this, doctor Liu looked up at Han Laoshan. “You found the An Gong Bezoar Pill?” ”

“Yes.”Han Laoshan nodded.

“Quickly bring it over for me to take a look.”Doctor Liu immediately extended his hand towards Han Laoshan.

“He had practiced medicine for so many years, but he had never seen a bezoar pill that was made from natural bezoar! ”

He did not expect Han Laoshan to be able to get two such precious medicinal herbs.

This made doctor Liu very surprised!

“Han Laoshan said, “I don’t have the An Gong bezoar pill for the time being. I just want to confirm with you that if I can get the an gong bezoar pill, how confident are you that you can cure my son?” ”

It turned out that he had not gotten it yet.

The look in Han Laoshan’s eyes was immediately replaced by disappointment as he made a ‘7’gesture.

“You mean you have a 70% chance?”Han Laoshan asked.

“Yes.”Doctor Liu nodded.

70% ...

Han Lushan narrowed his eyes.

This meant that there was still hope for Han Dongliang!

There was still hope for the Han family!

“Thinking of this, Han Lushan’s eyes were filled with excitement. ”
