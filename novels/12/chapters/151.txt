Chapter 152: 085: The Smart Lin Ze, the great burning! 4

“I think she looks like him!”

“The President’s girlfriend is too beautiful!”

These voices came after Ye Zao entered the elevator, so ye Zao naturally did not hear them.

She walked straight to Zhao Yang’s office and knocked on the door.

“Come in.”

Zhao Yang’s voice came from inside.

Ye Zhuo pushed the door open and went in.

Zhao Yang was sitting on the boss’chair, processing documents. His brows were tightly furrowed, and he thought that it was his secretary who came in to deliver the documents. He said directly, “Xiao Song, you can just put the documents on the table. I’ll look at them later.”

“Brother Zhao Yang, it’s me,”ye Zhuo said faintly.

Hearing this, Zhao Yang raised his head and saw that it was ye Zhuo. Zhao Yang hurriedly stood up from the boss’chair and said, “Zhuo Zhuo!”

Although ye Zao called him brother, he was younger than him.

However, Zhao Yang never dared to really treat ye Zao as a younger sister.

This was because even though ye Zao was young, he had a sense of authority.

......

Every time he saw ye Zao.

It was like an elementary school student who hadn’t finished his homework seeing a teacher.

He couldn’t help but feel a sense of fear.

Ye Zao took out a design draft from his bag and handed it to Zhao Yang. “This is the latest spring dress design. Take a look.”

Zhao Yang took the design draft and his eyes were filled with surprise.

There were two English letters at the bottom right of each design draft.

Zy.

Zy was ye Zhuo.

If he hadn’t seen it with his own eyes, Zhao Yang would never have believed that a teenage girl would have such talent in design!

Anyone who saw her design draft and finished product.

Only had one word in their heart.

Buy!

Currently, ZY’s name had spread throughout the entire design circle.

It wasn’t so much spread.

It was more of a shock!

There was a popular saying in the circle now, ZY’s debut was the peak!

If people knew that ZY was only 18 years old, it would probably cause a huge uproar.

Most importantly.

Zy wasn’t just a designer, she was also the inventor of clothes that could adjust the temperature!

Zhao Yang did not dare to imagine what kind of storm it would cause in the business world once these two pieces of information were spread!

She was only eighteen years old.

A child who had not even participated in the college entrance examination.

Zhao Yang suppressed the shock in his heart, he continued, “Miss Ye, the style that you have designed will definitely become the new favorite of the nation once it goes on sale! “Oh right, there’s a popular female celebrity recently who wants to ask you to design a red carpet gown for her. Will you accept this bill?”

“How much?”Ye Zhuo asked calmly.

Zhao Yang gestured with the number seven.

“Seven million?”Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly.

Zhao Yang shook his head.

Ye Zhuo frowned slightly. “It can’t be seven hundred thousand, right?”

“Yes.”

“I won’t accept it.”Ye Zhuo continued, “Tell the other party that I’ll consider seven million, and then send another message at the same time. Tell them that I only accept three orders a month, and I won’t accept more than three orders.”

The rarer the item, the more valuable it was.

In the business world, this was called hunger marketing.

Zhao Yang nodded. “Alright, I got it.”

Ye Zhuo’s gaze landed on the contract on the office desk.

Zhao Yang hurriedly pulled out the contract. “This is the contract we signed with song Shi Group. Do you want to take a look?”

“Song Shiyu?”

Zhao Yang nodded.

Ye Zhuo took the contract and took a look at it. After a moment, the corners of her mouth curled up. “Old Fox.” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“What’s Wrong?”Zhao yang asked, “Is there a problem with this contract?”

He knew song Shiyu’s character, so he had looked at it carefully twice just now and did not find any obvious problems.

Ye Zhuo placed the contract on the table. “Here, and here. But it’s normal that you can’t see it. He just happened to step on a loophole in the terms.”

Zhao Yang didn’t see anything wrong with it at first.

After hearing what ye Zhuo said.

He suddenly understood!

He admired ye Zhuo a little more.

Actually, Ye Zhuo was also a little surprised. He didn’t expect that song Shiyu, who was only 28 this year, would be so shrewd!

Ye Zhuo continued, “Tomorrow, get someone to send a copy of this contract to Song Shiyu. Remember not to say anything.”

“Don’t Say Anything?”Zhao Yang didn’t quite understand ye Zhuo’s thoughts.

If he didn’t say anything, how would song Shiyu know that they had already discovered that there was a problem with this contract?

Ye Zhuo seemed to have seen through song Shiyu’s thoughts, he continued, “If song Shiyu is worth our cooperation, then he will definitely come personally to apologize. If he doesn’t do anything, then it means that we need to change partners.”

Song Shiyu was a smart man.

Even if he didn’t say anything.

When he saw that Zhao Yang had someone send the contract back, he could understand Zhao Yang’s intention.
