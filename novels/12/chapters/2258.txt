And there was more than one.

“Lin Ze calmly put his phone into his pocket, turned the corner in front, and went straight to a dead end. ”

“Lin Ze leaned against the wall, looked at his watch, and began to count down in his heart. ”

“3,2,1! ”

Now.

Lin Ze swept his leg over.

When the air did not have the expected sound of a heavy object landing on the ground.

Something was not right.

Lin Ze took action while carefully observing the opponent’s weaknesses.

“Soon, Lin Ze realized that something was not right. ”

They should not be ordinary humans.

“Although they had a human skin, they were very similar to the core robots he met in the s galaxy. ”

“At this moment, one of the core robots pulled out a laser gun from his waist. ”

A Blue Line shot over.

“If he didn’t Dodge in time, his entire body would be cut in half. ”

Lin Ze narrowed his eyes and easily avoided the blue line. He used a camouflage technique and disappeared from the spot.

The two core robots looked at each other and saw the confusion in each other’s eyes.

Where is he?

Lin Ze was clearly here just now.

Lin Ze had appeared behind the core robots at some point in time. He took out an electric defibrillator and controlled the two core robots.

The core robots realized that something was wrong and immediately activated self-destruction mode.

Lin Ze was one step ahead of him and stopped them.

Lin Ze had stayed in the s galaxy for a period of time. He was very familiar with the laws of the s galaxy.

Anyone who dared to kill humans on Earth could be sentenced to death.

“These two core robots were the best evidence, so they could not be allowed to enter self-destruction mode. ”

“Lin Ze had some understanding of programming, so he quickly took control of the two core robots. ”

Chen Yaosheng was not worried that the interstellar people he sent out would fail. He changed his clothes and started to go out.

Bai Jingshu had the habit of eating takeout every night.

“However, tonight, for some reason, after eating a takeout, she suddenly felt dizzy and a wave of heat rose in her heart. ”

Bai Jingshu pressed her temples and stood up from the chair. She was about to take a bath.

“However, at this moment. ”

The living room door suddenly opened.

Click.

Bai Jingshu frowned slightly.

“She did not have any other family on earth, and no one could open the door. ”

Could it be a thief?

Bai Jingshu picked up her phone and walked into the living room while enduring the strong dizziness.

“As soon as she entered the living room, she saw a figure that made Bai Jingshu feel disgusted. ”

It was Chen Yaosheng!

“Without waiting for Bai Jingshu to speak, Chen yaosheng smiled and said, “Jingshu.” ”

“Get Out!”Bai Jingshu placed one hand on the door handle. “You are not welcome here.”

“Chen yaosheng smiled and said, “But why do I feel that you really need my comfort now?” ”

“What do you mean?”Bai Jingshu asked.

“What do you think?”Chen Yaosheng said as he walked over.

Bai Jingshu suddenly reacted. “You drugged me!” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“It seems that you are not too stupid.”

“Bai Jingshu took a few steps back without batting an eyelid. Then, she walked into the study and slammed the door. ”

Chen Yaosheng was such a despicable person!

Bai Jingshu had never expected that he would use such an underhanded method!

What should she do now?

Bai Jingshu’s entire body was burning up and she felt extremely uncomfortable.

“Although she was locked outside the door, Chen Yaosheng was not worried at all. ”

Bai Jingshu had been drugged. She would not be able to hold on for long and he would play with her.

“”Jingshu, no matter what, my love for You is real. Open the door and I will definitely leave you an unforgettable night.” ”

“Bai Jingshu’s back was pressed against the door, and she bit her lips tightly. ”

What should she do?

What should she do now?

“At this moment, she suddenly thought of someone. ”

Lin Ze.

“With this thought in mind, Bai Jingshu immediately took action. She immediately sent Lin ze a location and message: [ Bai Jiayuan, Block 6, Block 106, come quickly! ] ”

“After receiving Bai Jingshu’s message, Lin Ze immediately dropped what he was doing and rushed over to Bai Jiayuan. ”

“However, Lin Ze was about 30 minutes away from Bai Jiayuan. ”

“Even if he sped crazily, it would still take him about 15 minutes. ”

“Gradually, Chen Yaosheng became a little impatient and kicked open the door of the study. ”

“Bai Jingshu sat on the ground and saw Chen Yaosheng come in. “Chen Yaosheng, don’t come over!” ”

“Look at what you’ve become. Why are you still pretending?”Chen Yaosheng’s lips curled into a wretched smile.

“Bai Jingshu could not help but take a few steps back. “Chen Yaosheng, you’ll regret this!” ”

Bai Jingshu naturally could not resist Chen Yaosheng.

“At the most critical moment, the sound of someone kicking open the door came from outside. ”

“Instantly, countless lights shone in from outside. ”

It also illuminated Bai Jingshu’s heart.

Bai Jingshu looked up and saw a tall figure.

It was Lin Ze.
