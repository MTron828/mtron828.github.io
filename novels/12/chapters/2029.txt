Chapter 2030: 425: a piece of trash. Ye Lan was stunned! 1

Translator: 549690339

This old woman really thought she was a fool!

“It was not enough to lie to her once, but she had to lie to her twice? ”

“She would not be the same as before, foolishly fooled by them. ”

Three years ago.

“Just as Ye Lan was about to succeed in the DNA comparison, Grandma Fei colluded with Ye Zao and secretly changed the information. In the end, she even came forward to stop her from looking for her parents. ”

“Helpless, she could only put the plan of looking for her biological parents on hold. ”

“Grandma Fei looked at Ye Lan, “Lan Lan, I really didn’t lie to you. Qiu Di didn’t have any good intentions. If you don’t believe me, you can come with me. I’ll bring you to your biological father’s place. You guys can go and do an appraisal. If I say even half a lie, I’ll be struck by lightning!” ”

No one could lie in front of an appraisal report.

“Hearing this, a dark light flashed in ye Lan’s eyes, and the corners of her mouth were filled with ridicule. ”

“She was clearly the Manxing kingdom’s direct princess, but these people actually wanted to turn her into the daughter of a drunkard who had a history of domestic violence. ”

This was simply unreasonable!

“After saying this, grandma FEI continued, “Qiu di has always said that you’re the Manxing Kingdom’s direct princess. Then, has she given you an appraisal report?” ” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“”Stop talking,”ye Lan said. “I am an adult. I know what I am doing. I am not a puppet in your hands that can be manipulated by others.” ”

No one could stop her from recognizing her biological parents.

“”Burning saw you as her biological sister, so she handed over the management rights of the base to you,”Grandma Fei Sighed, “If she really saw you as a puppet, would she be so good to you? Would she hand over the management rights of the base to you? Think about it carefully. All these years, did burning ever mistreat you?” ”

“Hearing this, Ye Lan’s eyes were full of sarcasm. ”

Why would ye Zhuo hand over the management rights of the base to her?

It was all because of her outstanding ability!

All of this was earned through her own hard work.

“Ye Zhuo had adopted her, that’s right. ”

But Ye Zhuo had also obtained a good reputation at the same time.

Who in the Changyue Kingdom did not know that Miss Ye was a philanthropist and a Bodhisattva with low eyebrows.

“Not only did ye zhuo obtain a good reputation, but she also obtained free labor. She was a rare talent in the scientific research world. How many problems had she helped ye Zhuo solve over the years? Perhaps even ye Zao could not compare to her. Otherwise, why would ye Zao put her in an important position? ”

Ye Zao could be said to have both fame and fortune!

Who knew the pain she had suffered all these years?

“She had been living under people’s strange gazes, separating from her biological parents. ”

This was all caused by ye Zao!

“Compared to Qiu Di, Ye Zao was a demon. ”

Qiu Di could restore her identity as a princess and allow her to recognize her parents. Could Ye Zao?

“Other than being jealous of her identity as a princess, what else could ye Zao Do? ”

Ye Zao was a wolf in sheep’s clothing.

Hypocrite.

“Disgusting, sinister and cunning. ”

Ye Lan wished she could add all the dark words in the world to ye Zao.

“Thinking of this, Ye Lan looked up at Grandma Fei and continued, “I know very well who ye Zao is. Don’t stand here and disgust people! You are not only disgusting me, but also yourself!” ”

“”Lan Lan! What are you thinking? !”Besides anger, there was also sadness in Grandma Fei’s eyes. “You’ve lived with Zao Zao for so many years. If she was really a bad person, would you still be alive today?” ”

“The corner of Ye Lan’s mouth was full of sarcasm. “Did I beg ye Zao to adopt me back then? If she didn’t adopt me, I would definitely be living a better life than I am now!” ”

“If it wasn’t for ye Zao, she would have been recognized by her biological parents long ago! ”

Grandma Fei frowned tightly.

“She didn’t expect that ye Zao didn’t do ye Lan any favors when he raised her. Instead, ye Lan bore a grudge against him. ”

“Sure enough, there was always a seedling. ”

Ye Lan’s father was a scumbag. Ye Lan didn’t inherit any good genes either.

It was her expectations of ye Lan that were too high!

“”Lan Lan!”Grandma Fei looked at Ye Lan, her eyes filled with pain. ”

“”You should leave quickly! I don’t want to make things difficult for you,”ye LAN continued, “Don’t make things difficult for yourself. You’re already so old, you can throw everything away, but you still have to care about your face. Even if you don’t care about yourself, you still have to care about the younger generation!” ”

“After saying this, Ye Lan turned around and left. ”

“Ye Lan! You’ll regret it! You’ll definitely regret it!”Grandma Fei looked at her back and shouted.

Ye Lan?

Ye Lan narrowed her eyes.

“One day, she would let everyone know that she was not ye Lan. ”

She was a full moon!

She was the full moon of the Manxing Kingdom’s successor.
