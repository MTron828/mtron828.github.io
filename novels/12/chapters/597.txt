“Chapter 598: 143: The Unexpected Dr. YC, a large-scale face-smacking event! 7”

Translator: 549690339

This award ceremony was not something that just anyone could attend.

“The people who came were either the winners, their families, or scholars who had contributed to scientific research. ”

“Feng Xianxian smiled and said, “It’s just an admission ticket. I can get as many as I want.” ”

“Really?”Bai Xiaoman said in surprise. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Feng Xianxian continued, “The admission ticket is an electronic ticket. I’ll send it to your phone in a while.” ”

“”Okay!”Bai Xiaoman said excitedly, “Thank you, Xianxian!” ”

“You’re welcome! You’re my good friend. This is the treatment that good friends should receive.”

Feng Xianxian especially emphasized the words ‘good friend’.

“At that time, Feng Xianxian originally wanted to rope in Li Yueyue to isolate ye Zao together. ”

She did not expect Li Yueyue to reject Feng Xianxian without knowing what was good for her!

“If Li Yueyue had not rejected Feng Xianxian, Feng Xianxian would definitely have brought Li Yueyue along. ”

“Bai Xiaoman turned around to look at Li Yueyue, “Li Yueyue, I see that you also admire Dr. YC. Why Don’t you apologize to Xianxian? Our Xianxian is so kind. On account of your apology, she will definitely forgive you and give you a ticket!” ”

“You want me to apologize to her? In Your Next Life!”She was not the kind of person who would bow down to evil forces just for a ticket.

“Bai Xiaoman smiled and said, “Things are different now. Li Yueyue, you have to judge the situation!” ”

“Li Yueyue sat next to ye Zao and said through gritted teeth, “A villain gets what he wants!” ”

It really made people unhappy!

Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly. “Do you want to go?”

“I don’t want to Go!”Li Yueyue denied.

Ye Zao picked up his phone.

“A few seconds later, he continued, “Look at your phone.” ”

“Why are you looking at your phone?”Li Yueyue was stunned.

“Although she didn’t understand ye Zao’s intention, Li Yueyue still looked at it. When she looked at it, she immediately jumped up from the ground. ”

Admission tickets!

Admission tickets to the award ceremony!

“Ah Ah Ah! Big Zao! I really love you to death!”Li Yueyue wanted to hug ye Zao and kiss him.

She was really very excited!

“Seeing Li Yueyue suddenly become like this, Bai Xiaoman frowned. ”

Did Li Yueyue lose her mind because she couldn’t go to the award ceremony?

Crazy!

“Feng Xianxian looked at Li Yueyue, her eyes full of sympathy. “Xiaoman, since someone doesn’t know what’s good for him, forget it. I haven’t had dinner yet. Come with me.” ”

“Okay!”Bai Xiaoman nodded.

The two of them walked out of the door together.

“After the two of them drove them away, Li Yueyue looked at ye Zao and asked, “Zao Zao, where did you get this admission ticket? Did you also participate in the award ceremony?” ”

Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“”Holy Sh * t! Then you also participated in the Science and technology competition? Which Place did you get? It Can’t be the first place, right?” ”

“”I didn’t participate in the competition,”ye Zhuo answered. ”

“Li Yueyue said in puzzlement, “But doesn’t this mean that only those who win the prize will have admission tickets?” ”

Ye Zhuo raised his eyes slightly. “Because I’m the award presenter.”

“But isn’t the award presenter Dr. YC?”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Li Yueyue smiled and said, “Da Zhuozhuo, you’re not going to say that you’re Dr. YC, are you?” ”

“Congratulations on guessing correctly.”

“”Stop joking!”Li Yueyue continued, “Oh, I know. Your brother must have also participated in the science and technology competition. Did he get first place?” ”

“I am really Dr. YC.”

“Li Yueyue lowered her voice and said seriously, “To tell you the truth, I am actually Dr. YC’s daughter!” ”

Ye Burning:”...”

“In the blink of an eye, it was Saturday. ”

The award ceremony was held in the center of Beijing.

Li Yueyue arrived at the venue on time with the tickets given to her by Ye Zao.

“When Bai Xiaoman saw Li Yueyue, her face was filled with disbelief. “Why are you here too?” ”

“Li Yueyue said, “Do you really think that Feng Qianxian is the only person in the world who has tickets!” ”

Bai Xiaoman narrowed her eyes.

“At this moment, she suddenly saw a familiar figure. ”

Ye Zao?

Where did ye Zao get the tickets.

“Bai Xiaoman quickly ran to Feng Xianxian’s side. “Xianxian, I think I saw ye Zao Just Now!” ”

“Feng Xianxian was stunned for a moment, then she smiled and said, “I gave her the tickets, so it’s normal for her to come.” ”

“Because of Old Lady Lin, Feng Xianxian gave her a lot of tickets. ”

Ye Zao’s tickets were definitely hers!

How Shameless.

She actually used her tickets to attend the award ceremony.

“Bai Xiaoman said in surprise, “Ah? Why did you give her tickets?” ”

“Feng Xianxian said, “Actually, I didn’t give them to Ye Zhuo directly. I gave them to her family.” ”

Bai Xiaoman snorted. “Then she’s really shameless!”She actually came uninvited!

Old Lady Lin and the Lin family members also came.

“Old Madam Lin turned to look at Feng Qianhua and said unhappily, “Why don’t we see Jin City?” ”

Feng Qianhua looked at the entrance. “Don’t you see that it’s Here?”

Not only did Lin Jin city come.

Even ye Shu came with them.

The husband and wife were dressed in formal clothes and looked very formal.

“Old Madam Lin said unhappily, “It’s not like her daughter won the award. Why did she come? She’s embarrassing herself!” ”

The smile on Feng Qianhua’s face did not fade.

She did not expect ye Shu to come.

“After all, this award ceremony had nothing to do with Ye Shu. ”

It seemed that Lin Jincheng must have asked ye Shu to come!

This meant that Lin Jincheng still cared about her and Feng Xianxian from the bottom of his heart.

“”Aunt Lin, it’s a good thing that Sister Ye Shu is here. It means that she’s also happy for Xianxian.” ”

Old Mrs. Lin snorted coldly and did not say anything.

“At this moment, Feng Xianxian, who was wearing a uniform from the capital university, walked over. “Mother, grandmother, you’re all here!” ”

“Feng Qianhua smiled and said, “I’m not the only one here. Your uncle and aunt are here too.” ”

Feng Xianxian immediately greeted the others and sat down.

“Feng Qianhua looked at Feng Xianxian, then at Lin Jincheng and Ye Shu. Her face was full of pride. ”

Just like what Old Lady Lin said.

Ye Shu was here to embarrass herself.

“After all, the winner was her daughter. ”

What was the use of Ye Shu dressed so formally?

“At this moment, the host walked onto the stage and began the award ceremony. “Now, let’s welcome the third winner of the YC science and Technology award, Feng Xianxian from the Finance Department of Beijing University, to the Stage!” ”

The audience gave a warm round of applause.

“Under everyone’s gaze, Feng Xianxian walked up to the stage step by step. ”

“The host continued, “Now, let’s welcome the second winner of the YC Science and Technology Award, Student Chen Zhaomu from Qinghua University’s Computer Science Department, to the Stage!” ”

After Chen Zhaomu went up to the stage.

“The host then announced the winner of the first place. “Now, let’s welcome the first winner of the YC science and Technology Award, Student Lin Ze from Beijing University’s computer science department, to the Stage!” ”

Lin Ze?

“Feng Qianqian was stunned, and her face turned slightly pale. ”

She had never dreamed that Lin Ze would actually be the winner.

It wasn’t just Feng Qianqian.

Even the Lin family’s relatives below the stage were stunned.

Old Mrs. Lin thought she was seeing things. “That... That’s Ah Ze?”

“Just last night, she had thought that Lin Ze was inferior to Feng Qianqian in everything. ”

She didn’t expect that he would be slapped in the face in the blink of an eye.

Feng Qianhua didn’t feel good either.

“Just now, she was laughing at ye Shu for embarrassing herself... ”

“But fortunately, Ye Zhuo wasn’t in second place. ”

It seemed that ye Zhuo still couldn’t compare to Feng Qianxian.

“The award ceremony on the stage was still going on. “Next, let’s invite Dr. YC to present the awards to the three of you.” ”

Everyone’s eyes moved to the red carpet.

They saw a tall and slender figure in formal attire slowly walking over.

Feng Xianxian was stunned. Her face instantly turned pale and she almost lost her balance.

That... That Was Ye Zhuo?
