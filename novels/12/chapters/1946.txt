“Hearing this, father he said in surprise, “Xunfang, are you saying that she didn’t make those pastries herself? !” ”

He really couldn’t tell. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

He had always thought that these pastries were really made by Xu Yao herself.

“Mother he glanced at him. “You two father and son, you’re simply more pampered than the other!” ”

He ziteng was exactly the same as father he.

He did not have a brain at all.

“Father he scratched his head, then, he said, “No wonder she was injured the moment she entered the pastry shop! So it’s because of this! I can see that her wound is not shallow. She’s really cruel to herself! This kind of girl really can’t be taken! It’s too scary!” ”

“Looking at father he, mother he shook her head helplessly. ”

“On the other side, in the study. ”

He ziteng called the family doctor over to dress Xu Yao’s wound.

“The family doctor pinched Xu Yao’s hand. “Miss Xu is really lucky. She was just a little bit away from severing her meridians. When that time comes, she’ll have to undergo surgery!” ”

“Hearing this, he ziteng felt a lingering fear. “Fortunately, I’m Fine!”Otherwise, he would never forgive himself for his entire life. ”

“The family doctor continued, “However, although the meridians were not injured, the wound is considered quite deep. It’ll need a few stitches to heal.” ”

“The moment he heard about the stitches, he ziteng became even more worried. ”

“Xu Yao smiled and said, “It’s alright, don’t worry. It’s just two stitches, right? What are you afraid of If I’m not afraid?” ”

“”Yaoyao, I’m sorry,”he ziteng said guiltily. ”

He was the one who had let Xu Yao down. He did not protect her well.

“Xu Yao said gently, “It’s alright. I’m really alright. It doesn’t hurt at all. I Can’t blame anyone for this. I can only blame myself for being careless.” ”

“If there was anyone to blame, it was actually someone else. ”

“If mother he didn’t insist on Xu Yao making pastries, Xu Yao wouldn’t have fallen. If Xu Yao didn’t fall, she wouldn’t have cut her hand. ”

“He ziteng continued, “My mother is usually quite nice. I don’t know why she suddenly became like this. Yaoyao, I...” ”

“Xu Yao interrupted he ziteng’s unfinished sentence, “Ziteng, what are you talking about! ! What does this have to do with Auntie? It was all my own carelessness. If I want to blame someone, I can only blame myself for not preparing well. I should have prepared a sugar-free pastry for auntie so that this wouldn’t happen!” ”

“At the end of her sentence, Xu Yao’s voice was filled with self-blame. ”

It was all her fault.

“The more Xu Yao acted like this, the more he ziteng’s heart ached. “Yaoyao, don’t worry. I will try my best to convince my mother to accept you! I will definitely not let you suffer in vain.” ”

Xu Yao looked at He Ziteng and curled her lips slightly.

He ziteng was an idiot!

“A moment later.., xu Yao continued, “Ziteng, I’m an outsider after all. It’s normal for Auntie to not be able to accept me for a while. If it were me, I wouldn’t be happy to have my son, who I’ve raised for more than 20 years, suddenly bring back an unfamiliar girl. So, I can understand Auntie.” ”

“Speaking up to this point, Xu Yao looked at he ziteng. “Ziteng, I don’t wish for your relationship with Aunty to become so strained because of me.” ”

Xu Yao’s words were reasonable and reasonable. There wasn’t a single mistake that could be picked out. He ziteng was extremely touched.

“”Yaoyao, thank you.” ”

“Xu Yao smiled and said, “Are you stupid? Why are you thanking me?” ”

“At this moment, the family doctor came over with a bottle of medicine. “Miss Xu, it’s time to prepare for the stitches.” ”

“He ziteng asked nervously, “Will it hurt?” ”

“The family doctor smiled and said, “It will definitely hurt. Of course, you can also apply anesthetics. However, because it’s on your hand, applying anesthetics may affect your movements for the next two days. In addition, Miss Xu’s injury is on her right hand.” ”

“There’s no need to apply anesthetics.”Xu Yao looked at the Doctor. “I can do it.”

“”Do it, do it, do it! You have to do it! How can you stand it if you don’t use anesthetic!”He ziteng could not bear to see Xu Yao suffer that kind of physical pain! ”

“Xu Yao looked at he ziteng and continued, “But anesthetic will affect the operation for two days.” ”

“Xu Yao did not dare to directly stitch without anesthetic. The reason why she said that was because she knew that he ziteng would definitely speak up to stop her. When that time came, she could officially make a request. ”

Just like now.

“She followed the family doctor’s words and said that the anesthetic would affect her actions for two days. Next, he ziteng would definitely say that he could be her hand. ”

“As expected, he ziteng’s next sentence was, “I can be your hand. In the next two days, if you have any problems, just call me directly.” ”

“Really?”Xu Yao raised her head and looked at he ziteng in surprise.

“He ziteng nodded. “Of course, it’s true.” ”

“After he said that, he ziteng turned to look at the family doctor. “Doctor Mi, give me the anesthetic.” ”

“”Okay.”Doctor mi nodded. He took out the anesthetic, drew it into the syringe, and injected it into Xu Yao’s arm. ”

“Xu Yao grabbed he ziteng’s hand with her left hand and said with her eyes closed, “I’m afraid of Pain.” ”

“”Don’t worry, it doesn’t hurt.”He ziteng continued, “You said it didn’t hurt when your hand was cut, so why are you afraid of this?” ”

“Xu Yao said, “That’s different. I’ve been afraid of needles since I was young.” ”

He ziteng felt that the girl who was afraid of needles was very cute.

“Doctor mi said, “I’m going to start the anesthesia.” ”

He ziteng covered Xu Yao’s eyes with one hand.

“When he ziteng could not see, Xu Yao curled the corner of her lips, and her eyes were full of pride. ”

“Soon, the anesthesia was done. ”

The doctor began to stitch Xu Yao up.

“Because the wound was relatively large, a total of more than ten stitches were stitched up. ”

The doctor told them some things to take note of.

“He ziteng stood up and said, “I’ll send you back.” ”

Xu Yao nodded. “Then let’s go to uncle and aunt’s place to say Hello First.”

“His mother had caused Xu Yao to be in this state, but she had not said a word until now. He ziteng did not want Xu Yao to go and say hello to them. ”

Too Much!

This was too much!

“”There’s no need to greet them,”he ziteng said. ”

“Since his parents did not treat Xu Yao as a guest, Xu Yao did not need to respect them. ”

“Xu Yao smiled and said, “Ziteng, when did your temper become so bad? We’re all family. Why do you have to make things so awkward? Besides, you’re the only son of your parents. If you ignore them, they will definitely be very sad.” ”

“He ziteng looked at Xu Yao and sighed. “Yaoyao, you’re too kind!”Sometimes, being overly kind was not a good thing. ”

“If Xu Yao could be a little stronger, she wouldn’t have been bullied by mother he. ”

It was all his fault.

He didn’t take good care of Xu Yao.

He ziteng blamed himself.

“Let’s go.”Xu Yao pulled he ziteng. “Let’s go see uncle and aunt and greet them.”

“Xu Yao insisted on going, so he ziteng had no choice but to go with her. ”

“When they arrived at the He family’s parents’room, Xu Yao smiled and said, “Uncle and aunt, sorry for making a fool of myself today. I’ll go back first.” ”

“”Okay.”Father he nodded and said, “Take it easy on the road. I’ll get the driver to send you back.” ”

“Before Xu Yao could say anything, he ziteng said, “No need to trouble uncle Wang. I’ll send Yaoyao back.” ”

Mother he looked up at He ziteng. “You stay here. I have something to tell you.”

“”If you have something to say, we’ll talk when we get back.”After saying that, he ziteng held Xu Yao’s hand and turned to leave. “Let’s Go!” ”

Xu Yao followed he ziteng’s footsteps.

“Looking at He Ziteng’s back, mother he’s expression was very bad. ”

How could she have given birth to such a stupid son!

She couldn’t even tell that Xu Yao was putting on an Act!

He ziteng held Xu Yao’s hand as they walked out of the door and got into the car.

“Because Xu Yao’s hand was inconvenient, he ziteng was the one who helped to fasten the seatbelt. ”

“Xu Yao hesitated for a moment before saying, “Ziteng, I want to discuss something with you.” ”

“”What is it? There’s no need to discuss. Just tell me directly,”he ziteng said. ”

“Xu Yao continued, “I want to stay at your place for a few days.” ”

He ziteng was stunned. He did not understand Xu Yao’s intention.

“Xu Yao immediately explained, “My hand was injured. When I go back, my parents will definitely ask me what happened at Your House today! “My parents already felt that there was a huge gap between us. They felt that I was not good enough for you. If they saw that my hand was injured, they would definitely disagree with this matter even more.” ”

“At this point, Xu Yao continued, “I’m the only child in my family, so my parents will be a little nervous. Ziteng, don’t mind me. If it’s really inconvenient for you there, you can just send me to a hotel.” ”

“Actually, Xu Yao’s real intention was to stay with he ziteng and get pregnant with he ziteng’s child as soon as possible. ”

“The first time she and he ziteng got pregnant, it didn’t go smoothly. ”

“She thought that she could get pregnant without being married, but after meeting the he family’s parents today, she realized how important it was to get pregnant without being married! ”

She had to get pregnant with he ziteng’s child. Only then would she be able to sit firmly in the position of the He family’s matriarch!

“Hearing this, he ziteng smiled and said, “I can’t wait for you to stay at my place every day!” ”
