Translator: 549690339

I didn’t expect it!

I didn’t expect Feng Xianxian to disappoint me so much.

“I spent a lot of money to nurture Feng Xianxian, but Feng Xianxian is not even as good as a bastard born from a B * Tch. ”

Even Lin Ze could become the top scorer.

Feng Xianxian got third place!

What a shame!

“”Do you know what your mistake was?”After a long while, Feng Qianhua lowered her head and looked at Feng Xianxian. ”

“”My mistake is that I didn’t study hard! I shouldn’t have lost to Lin Ze...”she could lose to anyone, but she couldn’t lose to Lin Ze. ”

Her mother had set the standard for her since she was young.

Better Than Lin Ze.

Better Than Lin Ze.

“And she herself was also more outstanding, no matter what she learned faster. ”

She had won an award at level nine piano.

She had won an award at level ten go.

She had even participated in a calligraphy competition and won second place.

He had also won an award in oil painting.

“It was not an exaggeration to say that he was proficient in all aspects of music, chess, calligraphy, and painting. ”

“Most importantly, Feng Xianxian’s academic results were very good. ”

She was always first in her grade.

“Otherwise, she would not have been able to get third place in the entire city. ”

“When Feng Qianhua learned that Feng Xianxian was third in the entire city, she was also very happy. After all, there were more than 60,000 college entrance examinees in Beijing this year. ”

It was already very difficult for Feng Xianxian to get into third place!

“But now, Lin Ze actually got first place. ”

“In front of first place, what was third place? ”

Third place could only be used as a foil to the icing on the cake!

The daughter she gave birth to was supposed to be the most outstanding!

“But now, why couldn’t she even compare to the son of a B * Tch. ”

Feng Qianhua lost to Ye Shu back then.

She would never allow her daughter to lose to Ye Shu’s child.

“Why! Why Can’t You Fight for me!”Feng Qianhua shook Feng Qianqian’s shoulders hard.

“”Mom, I’m sorry...”Feng Qianqian cried, “I tried my best! I really tried!” ”

“Shut up!”

“Feng Qianhua interrupted Feng Qianqian, “You didn’t try your best! If you tried, how could you not even be comparable to that bastard Lin Ze! How could my daughter, Feng Qianhua, not even be comparable to a little bastard!” ”

Feng Xianxian was so scared that she didn’t dare to say a word.

She didn’t even dare to cry.

She couldn’t make her mother angry anymore.

The atmosphere was tense and oppressive.

“After a long while, Feng Qianhua bent her knees and knelt on the ground, she hugged Feng Xianxian and said, “Xianxian, I’m sorry! Mom didn’t mean to be fierce to you! Mom Can’t lose to that B * Tch ye Shu! And you can’t lose to Lin Ze! Remember, you must always be better than him. No matter what, you can’t lose to him!” ” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Feng Qianqian nodded. “Don’t worry, Mom. I’ll please Grandma Lin in the future. Feng Qianqian will become Lin Qianqian one day!” ”

“Hearing this, a smile finally appeared on Feng Qianhua’s lips. ”

“”Yes! This is my good daughter!”Feng Qianhua seemed to see hope, she continued, “There are no girls in the Lin family. Once mom marries you, you’ll be the only granddaughter in the Lin family. When mom gives you a younger brother, then Lin Ze will have nothing to do with it!” ”

“Feng Qianxian raised her head and looked at the table lamp on the table, “Mom!”! “So a college entrance exam scholar is nothing. Although I didn’t get into the college entrance exam, no daughter in the circle can compare to me. Even if I didn’t get into the college entrance exam scholar, I can still marry Cen Wuye!”! “One day, when you become Cen Wuye’s mother-in-law, at that time, they will all have to do as you say!” ”

“After saying that, Feng Qianhua continued, “Mom, don’t worry. I will help you make the health-preserving soup in the future and send it to Grandma Lin on time every day. I believe that one day, Grandma Lin will see the heart of our city!” ”

“Hearing the words ‘health-preserving soup’, Feng Qianhua’s gaze became more determined and she narrowed her eyes. ”

“With the health-preserving soup, Old Lady Lin could not live without her. ”

“When Feng Xianxian married Cen Shaoqing in the future,. ”

She would become the matriarch of the Lin family.

“Then, the capital would be her world! ”

“When she thought of this, Feng Qianhua narrowed her eyes. ”

...

Lin Jincheng’s situation had not been very good recently.

He had been recuperating in the sanatorium these few days.

“After learning that Lin Ze had passed the examination for the top scorer in the liberal arts, Lin Jincheng immediately pulled out the needle in his hand and returned to the Lin family despite the doctor’s objections. ”

“Mom!”

“Hearing Lin Jincheng’s voice, Old Madam Lin was overjoyed and immediately went out to greet him. “Jincheng is back!” ”

Lin Jincheng walked over quickly. “Where’s Ah Ze?”

“He’s resting upstairs.”

Lin Jincheng wanted to go upstairs to take a look.

Old Madam Lin held his hand. “Ah Ze was too tired from preparing for the college entrance exam. Don’t go up and disturb him.”
