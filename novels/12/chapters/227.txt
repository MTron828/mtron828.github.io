Chapter 228: 093: it feels good to keep slapping my face! 6

Translator: 549690339

Hearing this.

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

Li Qiandong was stunned.

What did he hear?

He heard ye Zhuo call Cen Shaoqing fifth brother!

You have to know.

No one else could call Cen Shaoqing fifth brother other than him.

Outsiders had to respectfully call him fifth master.

And he also gained Cen Shaoqing’s trust because he sacrificed himself to save Cen Shaoqing in the war-torn region of the Middle East eight years ago…

But how many days had ye Zhuo known Cen Shaoqing?

“Moreover, in Li Qiandong’s eyes, Cen Shaoqing had never been a person who loved talent. ”

“Even if ye Zhuo had technological talent, he should not have treated her so differently. ”

“Moreover, Ye Zhuo had just been wearing that gown. ”

“”Fifth brother, the gown that the almighty wore just now was brought over from the capital, right?”Li Qiandong asked. ”

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly without any special expression on his face.

“Hearing this, Li Qiandong’s face was full of surprise! ”

It really was!

“Li Qiandong swallowed his throat and asked the question in his heart, “Fifth brother, do you, do you like the Almighty?” ”

The gown that ye Zao was wearing just now was not as simple as the one he brought from the capital!

“It had been personally designed by Cen Shaoqing’s second sister, Cen Yueya, for her future brother and sister. ”

Just the diamonds on the gown alone had cost tens of millions.

The fabric used for the gown had been imported from country L.

The reason why it had been brought to the capital was originally to allow Mu Yourong to wear it at the engagement ceremony.

Unexpectedly.

The two had broken off the engagement due to a misunderstanding.

But today!

They were wearing it on ye Zao.

Could it be that he had misunderstood?

“Cen Shaoqing did not come tonight because of Mu Yourong at all, but because of ye Zao? ”

Li Qiandong felt a little confused.

How could Cen Shaoqing Like Ye Zao?

“Although ye Zao was very powerful, if Cen Shaoqing fell in love with ye Zao, what would Mu Yourong do? ”

Ye Zao did not need to rely on a man to live well.

But Mu Yourong was different.

Mu Yourong needed Cen Shaoqing.

“You’re thinking too much. I only have admiration for ye Zao.”Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads.

“”Admiration?”Li Qiandong frowned. “Fifth brother, if it was just admiration, would you let her wear the gown that sister Yueya personally designed? This was designed by Sister Yueya for the future fifth sister-in-law.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing turned to look at Li Qiandong. “It’s just a gown. If she wears it, she’ll wear it. How can there be so many twists and turns? Besides, I won’t marry, and you won’t have a fifth sister-in-law.” ”

“”Fifth brother, do you really not like the Almighty?”Li Qiandong asked. ”

“I don’t.”Cen Shaoqing shook his head.

“Li Qiandong continued, “Since you don’t like the Almighty, then consider Miss Mu! After all, Miss Mu was once your fiancée! Moreover, she’s a good person and has a kind heart!” ” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Cen Shaoqing turned his eyes slightly and looked at Li Qiandong. “Since she’s so good, why don’t you marry her! I’ll Be Your Matchmaker.” ”

“Li Qiandong was stunned for a moment and said somewhat embarrassedly, “How can I be worthy of Miss Mu!” ”

Li Qiandong truly felt that he was not worthy of such an outstanding Mu Yourong.

“Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips parted slightly. “Between the two of you, one is a foolish playboy, while the other is a scheming green tea. It’s simply a match made in heaven.” ”

The term green tea.

Cen Shaoqing had just learned it from ye Zhuo.

It could also be considered to be using what he had learned.

“Hearing this, Li Qiandong was extremely anxious and hurriedly explained for Mu Yourong: ”

“”Fifth brother! You’ve really misunderstood Miss Mu! Miss Mu isn’t the kind of person you think she is. She’s really very kind! She has helped many people before, and she didn’t even dare to kill cockroaches!” ”

He didn’t understand why CEN Shaoqing had such a deep prejudice against MU yourong.

Cen Shaoqing usually looked like a smart person.

Good and evil were distinct.

Why was he so muddle-headed now?

Cen Shaoqing couldn’t be bothered to listen to Li Qiandong’s nonsense. He turned around and walked downstairs.

Li Qiandong sighed helplessly.

He had missed out on such a kind-hearted girl like Mu Yourong.

Cen Shaoqing would regret it one day.

“At that time, it would be useless even if he regretted it. ”

“Even if Cen Shaoqing had taken a liking to Mu Yourong, based on Mu Yourong’s personality, it was unlikely that she would take a liking to Cen Shaoqing. ”

“After all, Mu Yourong was not the type of money-grubber who clung to the powerful. ”

Li Qiandong did not want Cen Shaoqing to regret it.

On the first floor.

“Ye Zhuo began his journey to taste the desserts. He ate over ten plates in one go. The Michelin Master in charge of making desserts was stunned. “Miss, aren’t you afraid of gaining weight?” ”
