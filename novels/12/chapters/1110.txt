“Chapter 1111: 244: ruthless methods, face slapping like the speed of light! 1”

Translator: 549690339

Liu Neng was very flustered now.

Very flustered.

Wasn’t it said that ye Zao had no business talent?

Then how did ye Zao see that there was a problem with this proposal?

What to do?

“Layers of cold sweat appeared on Liu Neng’s forehead, and he tried hard to calm himself down. What if ye Zao was bombing him? ”

Yes.

It was definitely blowing him up.

Ye Zao was only 20 years old this year.

How could a 20-year-old girl achieve success in both the technological and financial fields at the same time? Could she understand the proposal that was full of professional terms?

“Moreover, this proposal was written by Zhao Xueyin. ”

Not to mention ye Zao.

Even those who understood finance would not be able to see anything unusual in a short period of time.

What could ye Zhuo tell in such a short period of time?

It was definitely an act.

Ye Zhuo had been in the entertainment industry before.

It was normal for people who had been in the entertainment industry to know how to act.

“Thinking of this, Liu Neng heaved a sigh of relief and said with a smile, “President Ye, are you mistaken? I have carefully checked the three places you mentioned. There is no mission problem! You just need to be responsible for signing it.” ”

“Once ye Zhuo signed it, it would bring losses to the consortium. ”

Could she still stay in the consortium?

All of this was planned in advance by the Zhao family. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

They were just waiting for Ye Zhuo to sign it.

“Ye Zhuo slightly raised his eyes and looked at Liu Neng. There was clearly no expression on his handsome face, but it made Liu Neng feel extremely pressured. ”

“Liu Neng subconsciously swallowed his throat, as if a ray of light was on his back. ”

It was the first time.

“In front of a 20-year-old little girl, Liu Neng was so nervous. ”

This kind of feeling was something he had never felt before in front of Zhao Xueyin.

Who Was Zhao Xueyin?

She was a famous genius in the financial world.

Could it be that Zhao Xueyin could not compare to ye Zao?

An illusion!

It must be an illusion!

“Liu Neng tried his best to make himself look at ease and cleared his throat, then, he said, “President Ye, if you feel that there’s something wrong with this proposal, then you should carefully study it again. If there’s nothing else, I’ll take my leave first. If there’s anything else, you can call me. I’m still busy downstairs.” ”

“Go ahead.”Ye Zao’s tone was indifferent as he flipped another page of the proposal.

“Hearing this, Liu Neng heaved a sigh of relief. ”

He knew that ye Zao was acting.

“If ye Zao wasn’t acting, would he let him go so easily? ”

“It was just a little girl, and she still wanted to fight with him? ”

She really overestimated herself.

Liu Neng walked easily to the cubicle on the 33rd floor.

Allie was still standing there.

“Seeing Liu Neng come over, she asked curiously, “How is it? Did president ye deliberately make things difficult for you?” ”

“Liu Neng smiled disdainfully, “Just that little girl? When I was writing the proposal in Shunxi Financial Group, she was still playing with mud! She wanted to make things difficult for me, but she didn’t even consider how much weight she weighed!” ”

Ali narrowed her eyes.

“Yesterday, when ye Zao fired Sun Yiran in public, Ali was beside him. However, she still felt that ye Zao was worthy of being a descendant of the ye family, having the imposing manner of old ye back then. ”

She didn’t expect that he wouldn’t be able to do it today.

He couldn’t even deal with people like Liu Neng.

It seemed that she had overestimated ye Zao.

She originally thought that ye Zao was a person who couldn’t be underestimated.

She did not expect ye Zao to be so mediocre.

He was just a paper tiger.

“Yesterday, he had relied on old Zhang’s support to strut around in the financial group. Today, old Zhang’s true colors were immediately revealed when he was not around. ”

“Liu Neng looked at Allie and continued, “Are you free tonight? Big Brother will treat you to dinner.” ”

At this moment.

“Allie’s gaze passed Liu Neng and looked forward. She said with a smile, “Director Zhou.” ”

Director Zhou was the head of the human resources department.

“Hearing that, Liu Neng immediately turned back and asked with a flattering smile, “Why is director Zhou free to come to the 33rd floor today?” ”

Yes.

Liu Neng was asking the obvious.

What else could director Zhou be doing here?

It must be because of his promotion.

“Zhao Xueyin had promised him that as long as ye Zhuo successfully signed, he would be promoted to the 34th floor. ”

In the Shunxi Financial Group.

“The higher the position, the higher the floor. ”

He didn’t expect director Zhou to come so quickly. Zhao Xueyin’s efficiency was too high.

“The more Liu Neng thought about it, the happier he became. ”

Director Zhou handed Liu Neng an envelope with an inexplicable expression. “See for yourself.”

Promotion notice!

This envelope was definitely a promotion notice!

Liu Neng’s eyes lit up. He took the envelope with both hands and was so excited that he wanted to sing a song.

Ally looked over curiously. “What’s This?”

“Liu Neng smiled and said, “A promotion letter.” ”

“You’re going to be promoted?”Ally said in surprise.
