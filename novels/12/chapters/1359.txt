“Zhou Xiang braced herself and called out, “Dad.” ”

“Zhou Zuolong put on a fake smile and said, “It’s really rare that you still remember me as your dad.” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen smiled and said, “In-law, look at what you’re saying. Although this Xiang Xiang was married off, she’s still your biological daughter. How could she not remember you?” ”

“After saying that, old Mrs. Cen continued to instruct the servants, “Cuiyu, go and pour tea for Mr. Zhou. Don’t neglect the honored guest.” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen’s words were really beautiful. She reminded Zhou Zuolong that Zhou Xiang was married off and reminded Zhou zuolong that in the Cen family, he was just a guest. ”

Want to make things difficult for Zhou Xiang?

No Way.

“Zhou zuolong also heard the hidden meaning in old Mrs. Cen’s words and continued, “Mother-in-law is too polite. I’m not thirsty. I came here this time because I want to talk to Xiang Xiang.” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen smiled. “Now that I think about it, it’s been seven or eight years since you’ve come to the capital, right?” ”

“In these seven or eight years, Zhou Zuolong had never taken the initiative to visit Zhou Xiang. To suddenly come here at this time and say that he missed Zhou Xiang was a little hypocritical. ”

Zhou zuolong frowned.

This old woman of the Cen family was really too difficult to deal with!

Which family and an eighty or ninety-year-old woman would be as nosy as Bai Tang?

And Zhou Xiang was also useless.

“Seeing how Bai Tang bullied him, Zhou Xiang, her biological daughter, did not even say a word. ”

No wonder Xie Wanqiu was so angry.

“Zhou zuolong continued, “It’s precisely because I haven’t been to the capital for seven or eight years that I took this opportunity to visit the capital. The changes in the capital these years have been too great. When I just got off the plane, I almost couldn’t tell north from south.” ”

“After saying that, Zhou Zuolong turned to look at Zhou Xiang and said, “Xiang Xiang, I have two more things to say to you in private.” ”

In private...

“Zhou Xiang suddenly had an ominous premonition, and her scalp went numb. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen smiled and said, “We’re all family, in-laws. If you have anything to say, just say it.” ”

Zhou Zuolong looked at Old Mrs. Cen. “This is a family matter of our Zhou family. I hope that mother-in-law can understand.”

“Since they were already talking about family matters, old Mrs. Cen naturally couldn’t say anything more. ”

“Zhou xiang continued, “Dad, follow me over here.” ”

Zhou Zuolong followed Zhou Xiang’s footsteps.

The two of them arrived at the CEN family’s teahouse.

“Zhou Xiang poured a cup of tea for Zhou Zuolong and said, “Dad, do you have anything you want to say to me?” ”

“”What is it? You should be very clear about it.”Zhou Zuolong’s expression was very ugly. “Xiangxiang, I always thought that you were a good and obedient child, but this time, you really disappointed me!” ”

“”Your mother was so good to you. She was always thinking of you. Even now, she was also speaking up for you. But what about you? Think about it yourself. What have you done? ! You caused your mother to be hospitalized. You caused yinyin to be expelled from the ABA... “... “...” ”

“Hearing these words, Zhou Xiang’s heart was very upset. ”

What did Xie Wanqiu’s hospitalization have to do with her?

What did Zheng Wanyin’s removal from the ABA have to do with her?

“Zhou Zuolong had blamed these things on her. If it was anyone else, they would not feel good! ”

“Moreover, this person was her biological mother. ”

“”Dad!”! You do not understand the situation at all. Wanyin’s removal from the ABA was entirely her own problem. If she did not question the assessment officer’s subterfuge, she would not have been removed! “Mom was also sent to the hospital because of this!” ”

“Zhou xiang continued, “Dad, I’m your biological daughter. Why Can’t You Be More Fair?” ”

“Ever since Xie Wanqiu married Zhou Zuolong, no matter what problems happened, the person who was at fault was definitely Zhou Xiang. ”

Xie wanqiu and her biological daughter would never make mistakes!

“Zhou Zuolong did not expect Zhou Xiang to actually talk back to him. He was so angry that his face turned red, “Then let me ask you, did yinyin question the test paper because her score was too low? If ye Zhuo gave Yinyin 3a, would yinyin still question the score?” ”

“”Dad! Why are you lying through your teeth?”Zhou Xiang was also very angry, “Wanyin took the 1a test herself. She also saw the monitor in the exam room. That was the test paper that she made herself. She only took the 1A test. Can Zhuolong give her 3A?” ”

“Zhou zuolong continued, “Then let me ask you, did your mother look for ye Zhuo before the examination and ask her to keep the 3A for yinyin?” ”

Zhou Xiang frowned slightly. “But the crux of the problem is that Wan Yin did not even get a 3A!”

“Who is ye Zhuo? Is She Shaoqing’s girlfriend?”

“Yes.”Zhou Xiang nodded.

“Zhou zuolong said, “Since she is, and she is the main examiner, why can’t she give yinyin A 3A? I think she did it on purpose! She deliberately targeted yinyin and tried to influence others. I don’t agree with Shaoqing’s relationship with her!” ”

“Zhou Xiang said, “You’re being unreasonable!”! Since Zhuozhuo was the main examiner, she had to take on the responsibility of the main examiner and help them cheat together. What was going on? If everyone relied on their connections to pull strings, then there would be no need for the assessment!” ”

“Seeing Zhou Xiang like this, Zhou Zuolong almost could not control himself. ”

How did he give birth to such an idiot! Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

He was even dumber than an idiot!

“If it was not for Xie Wanqiu’s sake, he would have fallen out with her long ago. ”

“No matter what, he could not let Xie wanqiu down. ”

“Zhou Zuolong sighed, “Xiangxiang, you are my daughter. This father and daughter only have one life without an afterlife. Father is already so old. He might leave one day. Can’t you listen to father properly once? Do you think I can harm you?” ”

“”Although yinyin is not related to me by blood, she is my granddaughter who I raised. Seeing her suffer such a great injustice, as her grandfather, how can I not feel sorry for her?” ”

“In Zhou Xiang’s impression, Zhou Zuolong had always been a very powerful existence. Zhou Xiang was not used to him suddenly becoming like this. ”

“”Father, I can understand you, but please understand me as well. This matter is really not Luoluo’s fault.” ”

Zhou Zuolong picked up the cup and drank a mouthful of water. “You like ye Zao very much.”

“Yes.”Zhou Xiang nodded.

“I heard that your mother-in-law also likes her very much?”Zhou Zuolong continued to ask.

“Yes.”Zhou Xiang continued to nod.

“Zhou zuolong asked back, “Haven’t you ever thought about why both of you are so satisfied with ye Zao?” ”

“Zhou Xiang said without hesitation, “Because she’s worth it.” ”

“Zhou zuolong said, “That is because she has good means! She has deceived the two of you! Ye Zao is not worthy of Shaoqing at all. She is here for the Cen family’s wealth. If they really get married, the Cen family will be destroyed by ye Zao!” ”

Women were only women after all. They could only see the surface when they looked at problems!

“”Zha Zha is not that kind of person! Dad, it’s fine if you say such things beside me, but please don’t let Shaoqing hear you!” ”

Zhou Xiang knew Cen Shaoqing’s temper the best.

“When that time came, not to mention Zhou Zuolong, even if it was her biological mother, Cen Shaoqing would be able to turn hostile and not acknowledge her. ”

He couldn’t let Cen Shaoqing hear him?

He was Cen Shaoqing’s grandfather. Could it be that Cen Shaoqing still dared to do anything to him?

“Zhou zuolong continued, “Xiangxiang, you’re a heartless person. Your mother-in-law is already old. It’s inevitable that she doesn’t have such a comprehensive view of things! I’m your father. How could I harm you? Xiangxiang, if you still treat me as your father, then listen to me and let Shaoqing Dump Ye Zao!” ”

“Speaking up to this point, Zhou Zuolong paused, “You watched that child yinyin grow up. She has to have a good appearance, education, and character. Although she and Shaoqing are cousins, they are not related by blood after all. Although the capital is a little far away, your mother dotes on you and is worried that you will be deceived by Ye Zao. For You and the Cen family, she is still very willing to let yinyin marry over.” ”
