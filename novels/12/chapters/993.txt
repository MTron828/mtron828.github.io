“Chapter 994: 224: face-smacking, Big Ye or you, Big Ye! 6”

“Upon hearing this, Xi Weiyue held back her anger. ”

She had initially thought of playing the family card with Ye Langhua. Ye Langhua would definitely tell her everything about the Shunxi financial group without any reservations.

She did not expect that at this time.

Ye Langhua was still dead set on being stubborn!

“Ye Langhua kept saying that he treated them as a family, but when it came to serious matters, he would always push back! ”

Hypocrite!

This damn old woman was simply hypocritical to the extreme.

It was disgusting.

Her daughter deserved to die outside.

Retribution!

This was her retribution.

“Even though she had scolded Aunt Lang a few hundred times in her heart, Xi Weiyue still maintained a smile on her face. “Since aunt doesn’t know Master Zhao, then forget it. It’s getting late, you should rest early. I’ll go back to my room first.” ”

Aunt Lang nodded.

Xi Weiyue had just returned to her room when Xi Muwen walked in. “What did your Aunt Say?”

“Xi Weiyue’s expression was a little unsightly. “She said that she doesn’t know Master Zhao of the Shunxi Financial Group. I said that the company lost 200 million, and she has no intention of taking out the gold mine map! I think she just wants to burn the bridge after crossing the river!” ”

“Hearing such an answer, Xi Muwen was not surprised. “We were too impatient. We still have to take things slowly.” ”

“After being married to ye Langhua for so many years, Xi Muwen knew ye Langhua too well. ”

“If she could reveal the secret of the Shunxi Financial Group so easily, she would not have waited until now. ”

“After that, Xi Muwen continued, “Stay at home for the next few days and spend more time with your aunt and half a month.” ”

Xi Weiyue nodded.

...

Two days later.

“Ye Zhuo, Cen Shaoqing, Professor Yue, Professor Wang, and Tang Xue boarded the plane to Country C. ”

“Six hours later, they arrived at C Nation’s central airport on time. ”

It was 10:30 a.m. in C Nation.

“Cen Shaoqing had just gotten off the plane when he received a call. He turned to look at Ye Zhuo. “Leader, go with them to the hotel first. I have something to take care of.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Ye Zhuo, Professor Yue, and professor Wang arrived at the hotel. ”

Cen Shaoqing did not come back until the afternoon.

At three o’clock in the afternoon.

“Tang Xue came to look for ye Zao. “Miss Ye, Professor Yue asked me to come and ask you. She wants to go to the science and Technology Center for a walk. Do you want to go?” ”

Ye Zao nodded slightly. “Yes.”

Professor Yue was already waiting for Tang Xue in the lobby downstairs.

“When he saw Tang Xue Bringing Ye Zao over, professor Yue frowned without a trace. ”

“She had asked Tang Xue to ask ye Zao just to go through the formalities. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have been able to answer to Cen Shaoqing. ” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

He didn’t expect ye Zao to really follow them.

“Professor Yue’s expression didn’t change. “Miss Ye, Xiao Xue, you’re here. The car is already waiting outside. Let’s go quickly.” ”

“The car was very fast. After half an hour, they arrived at their destination. ”

“Professor Yue turned to look at Ye Zhuo. “Miss Ye, Xiaoxue’s Hindi is pretty good. Remember to follow her in a while. This technology center is very big. If you get lost, it’ll be troublesome.” ”

Hindi was a completely different language.

“Although ye Zhuo knew English, she definitely did not know Hindi. ”

“Tang Xue smiled and said, “Professor Yue, don’t worry. I’ll take good care of Miss Ye.” ”

“Professor Yue nodded and said, “Then let’s go in.” ”

The Science and technology exhibition was about to begin. Many people from all over the world had gathered at the science and Technology Center.

“Suddenly, professor Yue’s eyes lit up as if he had seen something. “Master Aiwen!” ”

Master Aiwen?

“Hearing this, Tang Xue looked at Professor Yue in surprise. “You mean master aiwen from country P?” ”

Master Aiwen was a big shot in the scientific and technological world.

Tang Xue only heard his voice and did not see him. She did not expect to hear Master Aiwen’s name in the scientific and technological center today.

Professor Yue immediately nodded. “It’s master aiwen! You Didn’t hear wrongly!”

Professor Yue had cooperated with Master Aiwen once three years ago.

“After saying this, professor Yue turned to look at ye Zao, making him look indifferent. He thought that ye Zao did not know Aiwen, then, he said, “Master Aiwen is a level one master of Science and technology in country P. His ability can be compared to that of Dr. YC in the country!” ”

Ye Zao’s eyebrows remained the same. “We know each other.”

Know each other?

Professor Yue frowned without leaving a trace.

A mocking look flashed across his eyes.

Ye Zao said that she knew Master Aiwen?

But did master Aiwen know who she was?

Tang Xue also glanced at ye Zao.

This ye Zao really dared to brag about anything!

“He wasn’t afraid that if he said too much, he would hurt his back. ”

“At this moment, master aiwen, who was chatting with others, suddenly glanced over and quickly walked over. ”

Professor Yue didn’t expect Master Aiwen to suddenly walk over.

“Could it be that master aiwen still had an impression of her, so he specially came to greet her? ”

“Just as professor Yue thought that Master Aiwen had come to greet her, master Aiwen stopped in front of ye Zhuo and said excitedly, “Miss Ye! It’s really you! I thought I was seeing things!” ”
