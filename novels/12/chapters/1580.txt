“Bai Shu smiled and said, “This girl likes to be praised for her beauty the most. Searing, if you praise her now, this girl won’t be able to sleep at night!” ”

“”Grandma!”Yuan Fei was a little embarrassed by Bai Shu’s words. “No matter how beautiful I am, I’m not as beautiful as cousin-in-law!” ”

Zeng Rou was stunned.

What was going on?

How did Bai Shu introduce ye Zao to everyone?

Who Was Ye Zao?

Cen Shaoqing’s girlfriend?

At this moment.

Zeng Rou was about to faint!

“She had never thought of Cen fifth master, Ye Zao, the Ye Zao that she had always trampled under her feet. ”

“But this ye Zao, whom she had always looked down on, had suddenly become CEN fifth master’s girlfriend. ”

How did ye Zhuo become Cen Wu Ye’s girlfriend?

“She had no family background, no background, and no family background. ”

Which part of her body could stand shoulder to shoulder with Cen Wu Ye?

“Other than that face, how else could ye Zhuo stand on the stage? ”

“Zeng Rou’s heart was filled with jealousy, and she almost couldn’t breathe! ”

“She wasn’t even worthy of Cen Wu Ye, and with Ye Zhuo’s status, how could she? ”

“At the very least, she had to be better than ye Zao. ”

Calm down.

She had to calm down.

Maybe Cen Wu Ye was just toying with ye Zao? Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

He wasn’t serious at all.

Thinking of this.

Zeng Rou felt a little better. She even felt a little sympathy for ye Zao.

The current ye Zao definitely felt that he could become madam Cen in the future.

Little did she know that Cen Wu Ye didn’t even take a fancy to her. Cen Wu Ye was just playing around with her.

Zeng rou pinched her sleeves.

“At this moment, Bai Shu looked at Zeng Rou. “Zeng Rou, where’s your sister?” ”

“Zeng Rou turned to look at Bai Shu and continued, “She seems to be at the back.” ”

“”Go and call her over,”Bai Shu continued, “There’s an important guest at home. Why didn’t you come out to welcome her?” ”

“Alright.”Zeng rou nodded and turned to go to the backyard to call for someone.

Zeng rou came to the backyard.

“Before she entered the house, she heard laughter coming from inside. ”

“”Jiadong, do you like Boys or Girls?” ”

“Zhao Jiadong said without hesitation, “Nonsense! Of course it’s Boys!” ”

“Hearing this, Zeng Qiuwen was a little unhappy. “Then what if I give birth to a daughter? Do I throw it away?” ”

“”Look at what you’re saying! How can I Throw Away My Daughter? ! I only said that I like boys more!”Zhao Jiadong continued, “Only by giving birth to a son can we divide the family’s assets! “Do you want the old lady’s assets to be divided by the eldest’s Family?” ”

“The Zhao family did not divide the family’s assets. Although it appeared peaceful on the surface, there was a fierce fight in the mainland. Everyone was waiting for the old lady to die so that they could divide the family’s assets! ”

“Zhao Jiadong’s elder brother, the Zhao family, had a son and a daughter. Only Zhao Jiadong, who was over 40, still did not have any children. ”

“Zeng Qiuwen sighed and touched her belly. “Actually, I also hope to get a man in one go!”who did not like having sons? ”

“According to the current situation of the Zhao family, the more sons they had, the more assets they would get. ”

“Sis!”

“At this moment, Zeng Rou’s voice sounded from outside the house. ”

Zeng Qiuwen stood up from her chair. “What is Ah Rou doing here at this time?”

“I’ll go take a look.”Zhao Jiadong stood up.

“A moment later, Zhao Jiadong opened the door. “Ah Rou, is there anything you need?” ”

“Zeng rou said, “Brother-in-law, there’s an important guest in the front hall. The old lady asked my sister to go over.” ”

“Who is it?”Zhao Jiadong asked.

“It’s fifth master.”

“When he heard that it was Cen Shaoqing, Zhao Jiadong’s eyes lit up. “Why didn’t you inform me earlier that Shaoqing was here! I’ll go over immediately!” ”

Zeng Rou was a little displeased.

What he said.

She was not a servant of the Zhao family.

She should have informed him earlier!

Zhao Jiadong quickly went back to his room. “Change your clothes and tidy up. Follow me to the Front Hall!”

“”Who’s Here?”Zeng Qiuwen could not be bothered to move. “Is there a need to be so grand? And you want me, a pregnant woman, to fetch her!” ”

“There’s someone from the Cen Family!”Zhao Jiadong said.

“Zeng Qiuwen immediately perked up and continued, “Is fifth master Cen Here?” ”

“Yes.”Zhao Jiadong nodded.

“Zeng qiuwen continued, “Then I’ll go change immediately!” ”

“Hurry Up!”

Zeng Qiuwen went to change.

“In less than a few minutes, she changed into a decent set of clothes and followed Zhao Jiadong out to the main hall. ”

“On the way, Zeng Qiuwen asked, “Is fifth master Cen not married yet?” ”

“Yes.”Zhao Jiadong nodded.

“Hearing this, Zeng Qiuwen’s eyes darted around. ”

“If Zeng Rou could catch fifth master Cen’s Eye, would anyone in the Zhao family dare to give her a look? ”

“At this moment, Zhao Jiadong seemed to have realized something. “Don’t let your imagination run wild. Although your sister is pretty good-looking, who is Shaoqing? Not to mention your sister, even if you have ten sisters, you wouldn’t be able to catch his eye.” ”
