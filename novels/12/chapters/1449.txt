Translator: 549690339

It was very difficult for an enterprise to nurture a batch of outstanding talents.

And they were all talents among talents.

Therefore.

The CEN base would definitely not give up on them so easily.

“Really?”

“What if the base doesn’t want us anymore?”

“Sun Yu continued, “All of you have been on strike these few days. who received the base’s resignation letter?” ”

“Hearing this, everyone looked at each other and shook their heads in the end. ”

“I didn’t receive it.”

“I didn’t receive it either.”

“Hearing that no one received the resignation letter, Sun Yu heaved a sigh of relief, he continued, “That’s why everyone doesn’t need to be so worried. We are all the backbone of Area B, so the base will definitely not dismiss everyone so easily! Everyone, gather at my doorstep tomorrow morning. We will go to the base together.” ”

He didn’t believe that the CEN base could dismiss all of them.

“Moreover, if he brought everyone back to work, master five would definitely appreciate him and think that he knew when to advance and when to retreat, so he would give him a promotion. ”

“After all, he was a person with charisma, leadership, and executive ability. ”

“Thinking of this, Sun Yu was very excited. ”

“Soon, he would also become a manager. ”

“Okay!”

Everyone nodded.

“In the blink of an eye, the next day arrived. ”

Everyone gathered at Sun Yu’s house to wait for him.

Sun Yu walked down from upstairs.

“Brother Sun has come down.”

“Sun Yu looked at everyone and asked, “Is everyone here?” ”

“Everyone Is Here!”

“Sun Yu nodded. “Since everyone is here, let’s set off.” ”

“Let’s Go!”

Everyone rushed towards the direction of the base in an imposing manner.

“There were fifty people, just enough for a bus. Twenty minutes later, the bus stopped at the entrance of the base. ”

“With Sun Yu in the lead, everyone punched in. ”

Sun Yu stood in front and placed her work card in the induction zone.

Beep —

INVALID CARD!

Invalid card? Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Why was it an invalid card?

Sun Yu frowned slightly.

What was going on?

Could it be that the base had canceled his work card after he hadn’t returned to work for a few days?

That shouldn’t be possible.

“”You, come over and give it a try!”Sun Yu pulled the other person beside her over. ”

That person quickly took out his work card and leaned against the induction ground.

Beep!

It was still an invalid card.

Why was it an invalid card again?

“”I, I’ll give it a try.”The other person squeezed to the front of the induction ground and placed his work card on it. ”

Beep!

It was still an invalid card.

Why was it still an invalid card?

“At this point, Sun Yu’s forehead was already covered in beads of sweat. She raised her head to look at the others and continued, “Everyone, don’t be anxious. line up properly and try one by one.” ”

“Hearing this, everyone immediately lined up spontaneously and swiped their cards one by one. ”

“However, the result was the same in the end. ”

Invalid cards.

All of them were invalid cards.

“At this moment, everyone’s faces turned pale as they looked at Sun Yu. “Brother Sun, what should we do?” ”

“”All of our cards are invalid cards. It Can’t be that all of us have been expelled, right?” ”

“Brother Sun?”

Sun Yu’s expression was also very ugly.

No.

It couldn’t be.

There were more than 50 of them. How could they be expelled by the base at the same time?

There must be a problem with the system!

“Sun Yu took out her phone. “Don’t panic, don’t panic. Maybe there’s a problem with the system. I’ll call HR to ask.” ”

“Then hurry up and make the call.”

Sun Yu dialed the HR Department’s number.

Everyone looked at Sun Yu with anticipation.

Soon.

The call was connected.

“”Hello, Sister Nan? This is Sun Yu from Section B’s research room. I’d like to ask, why did our section B staff’s work card become invalid? Is there a problem with the system?” ”

“”Sun Yu?”Han Nan on the other end of the phone was silent for a moment before she continued, “Is it Sun Yu from the quality inspection team?” ”

“Quality inspection team? Sister Nan! Have you forgotten? I’m from the quality inspection team!”

“Sun Yu from the quality inspection team. At this moment, Han nan remembered and continued, “It’s that Sun Yu from the strike, right?” ”

“Although the strike sounded unpleasant, Sun Yu still nodded and smiled. “Yes, yes, yes.” ”

“Han nan continued, “When you came to the base, you didn’t sign the contract and didn’t look at the Employee Handbook?” ”

“Sun Yu’s heart skipped a beat, and she suddenly had a bad feeling. ”

Could it be...

No.

It couldn’t be.

“Sun Yu pretended not to understand and continued, “Sister Nan, you... You Mean... ?” ”

“”Don’t you understand the invalid card?”Han nan continued, “Everyone in your research lab has already been expelled by the base.” ”

Removed from the base!

And it was all of them.

How could this be?

“”Nan, Sister Nan,”sun yu stuttered, “Y-you must have made a mistake.” ”
