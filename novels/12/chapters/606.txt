“Chapter 607: 146: face smacking by force. This is my boyfriend, Cen Shaoqing. Feng Xianxian was dumbfounded! 1”

Li Yueyue was immediately stunned.

“Looking at little white standing in front of her, her eyes were filled with disbelief. ”

“After being stunned for a few seconds, she finally reacted and turned to look at Ye Zao. “Was it talking just now?” ”

Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“”Yes, you didn’t hear wrongly! It was the most powerful person in the universe talking just now!” ”

“Li Yueyue gulped. “F * CK, F * ck!” ”

“She originally thought that Little White was a pile of scrap metal, but she did not expect that this fellow was actually the strongest king. ”

Not only could he speak.

He was also so intelligent!

“Li Yueyue also had a robot butler at home, but his language ability was not as strong as Little White’s. ”

“If Little White had not been sent by express mail, Li Yueyue would have suspected that there was a living person hidden inside. ”

“Xiao Bai turned around and looked at ye Zao. In an instant, he was full of drama. “The most beautiful robot in the universe, Great Zao Zao. Long time no see. I’ve missed you to death! Do You Miss Me?” ”

“No.”

Xiao Bai looked hurt. “D * MN! Heartless! !”

“Li Yue tugged at ye Zao’s sleeve. “Zao Zao, where did you buy this robot at home? I want to buy one too!” ”

Little White slid to Li Yueyue’s side. “It’s a limited edition robot! The kind that you can’t buy even if you have money!”

“Really?”Li Yueyue looked at ye Zao.

Ye Zao nodded. “I assembled little white myself.”

Holy Sh * t!

I assembled it myself!

“Li Yueyue was stunned, but when she remembered that ye Zao’s other identity was Dr. YC, Li Yueyue was not surprised. ”

“After all, Ye Zao had his own achievements in the science and technology world. ”

It was normal to assemble a robot.

“Is it called Little White?”

“Yes! It’s called Little White!”Little White answered quickly.

“Li Yueyue deliberately teased little white, “You’re so amazing, why do you work so hard? How much does Big Zao Pay You in a month?” ”

“I use my salary to pay the Electricity Bill!”

Li Yueyue was amused by little white and burst into laughter.

The servants at home were also amazed and all came over to tease little white.

Little White had a powerful brain. It answered everyone’s questions very quickly.

The next day was Sunday.

“Because she had made an appointment with Feng Qianhua, she would bring Jiang Suran as a guest today. ”

“It was only nine o’clock, and Old Lady Lin was sitting in the hall, looking forward to it. ”

“”Aunt Zhang, go outside and see if Qianhua has arrived?” ”

“Aunt Zhang smiled and said, “Old Madam, don’t worry. It’s only nine o’clock now. Miss Qianhua has agreed to meet us at half past ten. Miss Qianhua has always been punctual. She should be here by half past ten.” ”

“Old Mrs. Lin nodded and continued, “Go and see Qingxuan! Don’t let him go out today!” ”

“Okay.”

“Aunt Zhang went to Lin Qingxuan’s courtyard, but she was told by the maid that Lin Qingxuan had already left. ”

Aunt Zhang returned to old Madam Lin’s courtyard.

“When she heard that Lin Qingxuan had already left, old madam Lin frowned. “Why did he leave so early?” ”

Aunt Zhang shook her head. “I’m not too sure either.”

“At 10:30 am, Feng Qianhua arrived on time. ”

Jiang Su ran was also following behind her.

“”Aunt Lin, this is the second daughter of the Jiang family that I told you about, Jiang Su ran.” ”

“Jiang su ran quickly walked to Old Madam Lin’s side. “Nice to meet you, Old Madam. I’m Jiang Su ran. You can just call me su ran.” ”

Old Madam Lin nodded and scrutinized Jiang Su ran from top to bottom.

“Jiang Su ran was 1.62 meters tall and was about the same height as Feng Qianhua. Her looks were average and she wasn’t very pretty, but she wasn’t too ugly either. She was the type that could stand to be seen. ”

The main point was that her buttocks were fuller.

“With just one look, it was obvious that she was a good mother. ”

“Seeing this, a satisfied light appeared in Old Lady Lin’s eyes. ”

“When a man reached Lin Qingxuan’s age, the most important thing was to have children. ”

Looks were secondary.

What she cared about the most was whether the woman could have children. She could not repeat the same mistake and marry another woman who could not have children.

“”Sit, sit.”Old Lady Lin continued, “We are not outsiders. There is no need to be so restrained.” ”

“”Thank you, Old Lady.”Jiang Suran bent down and sat down. ”

“As expected, she had entered female Durban. ”

Her temperament was different from that of an ordinary person.

Old Lady Lin liked people who knew the rules.

“At the moment, she was very satisfied with Jiang Suran. ”

Feng Qianhua picked up the soup that she had brought for old Mrs. Lin. Jiang SU ran stood up with a smile. “Let me serve the soup to the old lady.”

Feng Qianhua felt a little uncomfortable hearing this.

But Old Mrs. Lin liked to hear it.
