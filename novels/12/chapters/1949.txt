“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded.

“”You silly boy, you don’t even know how to follow us!”Old Mrs. Cen glanced at CEN Shaoqing and said with disdain, “With you like this, sooner or later, Yezi will be cheated by other Big Hoof Hoof Hoof Hoof Hoof Hoof Hoof Hoof Hoof Hoof Hoof Hoof Hoof!” ”

“Cen Shaoqing pinched the Buddha bead. “Grandma, you’re worrying too much.” ”

Old Mrs. Cen snorted. “I’m nothing.”

“On the other side, Ye Zhuo, Lin Ze, and Lin Jincheng, Ye Shu, came to south city together. ”

The family of four came by special plane.

The person who arranged the special plane was none other than Cen Shaoqing.

South city was a city with four distinct seasons.

“On the third day of the first lunar month, the warm sun shone brightly. ”

“The temperature reached 15 degrees, neither too hot nor too cold. Walking under the warm sun, it was very lively. ”

“As soon as they got off the plane, Lin Qingyun and his wife came up to welcome them. They smiled and said, “Jin city, sister-in-law, Ah Ze Zhuozhu, your family of four has finally arrived.” ”

Ye Zhuozhu and Lin Ze greeted them politely.

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “Second sister-in-law, the weather here is really good. No wonder you’re getting younger and younger.” ”

“South city was now 15 degrees Celsius, and the capital city was minus 15 degrees Celsius. ”

It was impossible to raise a flower outdoors.

“Zhang Zhenzhen smiled and said, “Only you know how to laugh at Me! You’re even getting younger as you live! You’re already an old woman!” ”

The two sisters-in-law joked as they walked.

Lin Jincheng and Lin Qingyun were also discussing something in a low voice.

Ye Zhuo and Lin Ze walked at the back.

This family was very handsome. Walking in the airport made many people look back at them.

They were full of admiration.

What kind of immortal family was this.

“Lin Qingyun turned to look at Ye Zao. “Zao Zao, why didn’t you let Shaoqing come over to play for a few days?” ”

“Ye Zao said, “Second uncle, he happened to have something on, so he didn’t come.” ”

“Lin Qingyun nodded and continued, “If you have time, you must let Shaoqing come over to play too.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“Zhang Zhenzhen looked at ye Shu and said, “What are fourth brother and sister-in-law busy with? Ask them to come. They said that they won’t be free for a while and that it will be in March.” ”

Fourth brother and sister-in-law were referring to Lin Qingxuan and Xia Xiaoman.

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “The four of them have gone abroad for the New Year and haven’t come back yet.” ”

“”I say,”Zhang Zhenzhen said, “The two of them are really in love.” ”

“Lin Qingxuan and Xia Xiaoman had been married for a long time, but they had never had any arguments. ”

It was said that it was not good for a couple to be separated halfway through their marriage. It seemed that it was not the case.

Ye Shu nodded. “Yes.”

An extended rolls-royce was parked outside the airport.

Lin Qingyun’s home was on a nearby mountain.

It was a big manor near the mountain.

A few children lived on the side.

It was also a lively and large family.

“There were many fruit trees and plants planted on the mountain. At this time, the red plums were in full bloom. Looking from afar, the entire mountain was a bright red color. ”

It was especially beautiful!

“Zhang Zhenzhen smiled and said to her eldest daughter-in-law, “Shuangshuang, bring little twelve and the children to pick strawberries. In the afternoon, we can go to the sun room to have a barbecue. This way, young people won’t be bored sitting together with us old people.” ”

“On the other side of the manor, an acre of strawberries was planted. Usually, there were people who specialized in taking care of it, and there were all kinds of strawberries. ”

“”Okay, Mom.” ”

“Hearing the mention of picking strawberries, the children were so happy that they almost jumped up. They held ye Zhuo’s hand and said, “Aunt, I’ve wanted to pick strawberries for a long time, but my grandmother has never let me. She said that she will only pick them when you come!” ”

“”Aunt, our milk strawberries are very sweet! A hundred times sweeter than the ones sold outside!” ”

“Ye Zao originally did not have much interest in picking strawberries, but when he heard that the strawberries were a hundred times sweeter than the ones sold outside, his eyes immediately lit up and his eyebrows curved. “Then let’s go pick them now!” ”

“Okay!”

“Third Cousin’s wife smiled and said, “Little Twelve, don’t be anxious. Let’s change into something lighter first.” ”

“The sun was warm outside, and the temperature inside the strawberry shed was at least 25 degrees Celsius. ”

“Okay!”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

The few of them changed their clothes and went into battle lightly.

“The One Mu of strawberry shed looked very big, and there was a bright red patch inside. There were also white snow-white strawberries, as well as the expensive zhangji strawberries, Hongyan strawberries, Yuxiang strawberries, and so on. ”

“Looking at the bright red large strawberries, ye Zao could not help but swallow his throat. He took a bite, and instantly, the juice flowed in all directions. It was very sweet! ”

The taste was very good.

It was also very sweet!

“Perhaps it was because he picked it himself, ye Zao felt that he had never eaten such delicious strawberries. ”

He ate one after another.

...

On the other side.

“The morning sunlight shone in from the window. Looking at the sleeping girl beside him, he ziteng’s lips curled up slightly. ”

What was happiness?

“In the past, he thought that happiness was earning a lot of money. ”

“Now, for him, happiness was waking up with the person he loved by his side. ”

Just like now. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

In a flash.

“He ziteng gently got off the ground, went to the kitchen, and began to make breakfast. ”

Little did he know.

“Just as he got up, Xu Yao opened her eyes on the bed. ”

Her eyes were full of pride.

“Who would have thought that the he family’s eldest young master, who had always been high and mighty, would personally make breakfast for her? ”

“In this world, who else could have such an ability other than her? ”

To directly subdue he ziteng?

“The pride in Xu Yao’s eyes grew even stronger. At this moment, she seemed to have thought of something. She took out her phone and looked at it. A few seconds later, she put the phone back in its original place. ”

“Not long after, a fragrance drifted from the kitchen. ”

“When he ziteng walked into the bedroom again, Xu Yao was already changing her clothes. ”

“Seeing he ziteng suddenly come in, Xu Yao’s face turned red. “Why didn’t you knock when you came in! Hurry up and get out, I want to change my clothes!” ”

“He ziteng smiled and said, “We’re already an old married couple, why are you still shy?” ”

“Who’s an old married couple with you?”Xu Yao threw a pillow over.

“He ziteng was a little confused. They had already done this a few times, why was Xu Yao still so thin-skinned. ”

It was simply unbelievable.

“However, he really liked the pure Xu Yao. ”

Little did he know that Xu Yao was faking it all.

“He ziteng continued, “Alright, Alright, Alright. I’ll turn around. Quickly change your clothes. Breakfast is ready.” ”

“Okay.”Xu Yao nodded.

“Xu Yao quickly changed her clothes, brushed her teeth, washed her face, and applied skin care products. ”

“Twenty minutes later, when she sat at the dining table, she seemed to have thought of something. She looked at he ziteng and said, “Ziteng, we seem to have forgotten last night, forgotten...” ”

“At the end of her sentence, her face was flushed red. She could not continue what she wanted to say. ”

“Forgotten what?”He ziteng asked in confusion.

“”That, that...”Xu Yao stuttered like a little wife who had just entered the house. ”

“He ziteng came to his senses at this moment and said with a smile, “I know what you want to say! You want to say that we didn’t take any measures, right?” ”

“Yes.”Xu Yao nodded.

“He ziteng smiled and said, “I did it on purpose.” ”

“Xu Yao pretended to be surprised and said, “Why?” ”

He Ziteng didn’t say anything and his face was full of smiles.

“Xu Yao continued, “What If I get pregnant? You’re too ridiculous!” ”

“Hearing this, the smile on he ziteng’s face froze. “Yaoyao, don’t you want to have a child that belongs to us?” ”

“Xu Yao shook her head first, then nodded, he ziteng continued, “It’s not that I don’t want to have a child that belongs to us, but I haven’t received uncle and aunt’s approval yet. If I get pregnant at this time, uncle and aunt will definitely think that I’m a frivolous girl.” ”

“”I know what kind of girl you are the best.”He ziteng scooped a bowl of porridge for Xu Yao. “Yaoyao, stay with me. You Don’t have to do anything to please anyone!” ”

“After what happened yesterday, he ziteng didn’t want Xu Yao to feel wronged anymore. ”

“Xu Yao was his girlfriend. No matter what his parents said, he had to marry Xu Yao. ”

“Hearing this, Xu Yao was very touched. She looked at he ziteng with red eyes and said, “Ziteng, thank you.” ”

“He ziteng smiled and said, “Silly Girl, why are you thanking me?” ”

“Xu Yao continued, “Ziteng, I’m saying what if, what if uncle and aunt never approve of me? After all, my family background is indeed not as good as yours. Our families are not of the same level.” ”

Xu Yao knew he ziteng too well. She knew how to say something that would arouse he ziteng’s sympathy and affection.

“For example, now. ”

He ziteng must have loved her to death.

“Reality proved that Xu Yao’s guess was right. He ziteng indeed loved Xu Yao to death. His gaze was firm as he said, “Yaoyao, don’t worry. No matter what happens, I will always be with you, forever and Ever!” ”

“Xu Yao nodded and said emotionally, “Ziteng, me too! No matter what happens, I will always be with you.” ”

“Seeing Xu Yao like this, he ziteng hugged her in his arms and kissed the top of her head. ”

“After breakfast.., he ziteng continued, “I might be a little busy today. Fifth Brother and fifth sister-in-law are not around. I still have a meeting at night. If you have anything to do during the day, just let the servants do it. I will try my best to come back before nine o’clock at night.” ”

Only be back before 9 pm?

Xu Yao narrowed her eyes.

Wasn’t this exactly what she wanted?

“Xu Yao stood up and said considerately, “Work is more important. You Go and do your work. I can stay at home by myself. You Don’t have to worry.” ”
