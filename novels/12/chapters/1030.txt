...

On the other side.

The lawyer brought Xi Weiyue to the Shunxi Financial Group.

Shunxi Financial Group was ranked 10th in the global rankings.

It was a real golden house!

Xi Weiyue was born into a wealthy family. What kind of luxurious building hadn’t she seen before?

“But now, standing in front of the Shunxi Financial Group, she finally knew what a real noble was!”

What was the true splendor of gold and Jade!

“Thinking about how she would soon become the future chief of the Shunxi Financial Group, Xi Weiyue was very excited.”

“She was grandfather Ye’s heir. Even though she had just joined the Shunxi Financial Group, with her talent, becoming the chief was only a matter of time.”

“Si Lu adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses and turned to look at Xi Weiyue. “Miss XI, this is the Shunxi Financial Group’s headquarters!””

Xi Weiyue tried her best to suppress the shock in her heart and nodded. “Okay.”

The lawyer picked up his phone to look at the time and sent out a message. [ we’re already downstairs of the Financial Group. ]

“The other party quickly replied, [ Okay, thank you for your hard work. ]”

“When he saw the other party’s reply, a faint smile appeared in the lawyer’s eyes. Then, he turned to look at Xi Weiyue and returned to his business-like manner. “Miss XI, come with me.””

Xi Weiyue nodded and followed the lawyer’s footsteps.

“The lawyer brought Xi Weiyue through the lobby on the first floor and stopped in front of the elevator marked “V”. Then, he pressed the up button.”

It had been a long time since Shunxi Corporation had a new member.

“At this moment, when the passing employees saw Xi Weiyue, they all looked at her strangely.”

“Feeling everyone’s gaze, Xi Weiyue straightened her back even more.”

“When Xi Muwen was young, he was a rare handsome man. Yang Jiao’s looks were also among the best. As her daughter, she naturally did not look bad.”

Xi Weiyue was surrounded by many suitors.

What was a girl’s most advantageous weapon?

“Of course, it was her beauty!”

“Since she had a beautiful face, she would not waste resources.”

Using her face to conquer a man and make him willingly do anything for her was also a kind of ability!

“Of course, the man Xi Weiyue wanted to subdue the most was still si lui.”

Si Lui was the chairman of Shunxi Financial Group.

“She was new here and was very unfamiliar with everything in the financial world. If she could subdue si lui, then everything would be much smoother.”

Unfortunately.

Si lui seemed a little bored.

He barely spoke to her on the way here. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“However, Xi Weiyue was not in a hurry.”

After all...

There was still a long way to go.

“Si lui noticed Xi Weiyue’s change from the corner of his eyes, and his eyes revealed a subtle sense of disgust.”

Ding

“At this moment, the elevator door opened.”

“Si lui made a ‘please’gesture. “Miss XI, Please.””

Xi Weiyue nodded slightly and walked into the elevator.

Si lui followed closely behind and pressed the button to close the door.

“The elevator rose very quickly. In less than ten seconds, it stopped at the 58th floor.”

“The lawyer said calmly, “Miss XI, we’re here.””

Xi Weiyue nodded and followed the lawyer out of the elevator.

“The moment they stepped out, an assistant in a suit greeted them respectfully, “Chairman.””

“The lawyer nodded slightly and continued, “This is elder Ye’s heir, Miss XI.””

“Miss XI.”The assistant looked at Xi Weiyue respectfully.

Xi Weiyue nodded.

The lawyer looked up at the assistant. “Is Miss Zhao in the office?”

“The assistant said, “Yes, Miss Zhao has been waiting for you two for a long time.””

“In the entire Shunxi Financial Group, who had the right to be called Miss Zhao?”

“Of course, it was Zhao Bin’s daughter, Zhao Xueyin.”

“Zhao Bin, elder Zhang, and grandfather Ye were the founders of Shunxi Financial Group.”

“Old Zhang had never married, so he had no descendants.”

“Old Master Ye passed away early. Later, ye Langhua did not have the heart to manage the affairs of Shunxi Financial Group, so old Zhang, the head of Shunxi Financial Group, became Zhao Bin.”

“Now, the Zhao family was a dominant existence in Shunxi Financial Group.”

“As Zhao Bin’s daughter, Zhao Xueyin was naturally a princess-like existence, and was also the future successor of Shunxi Financial Group.”

“In the entire Shunxi Financial Group, who wouldn’t address Zhao Xueyin as Miss Zhao?”

“Xi Weiyue didn’t understand the history of the Shunxi Financial Group, but she subconsciously felt that this Miss Zhao wasn’t someone to be trifled with.”

“But no matter how hard it was to provoke her, she wasn’t afraid!”

“After all, she was Grandfather Ye’s successor!”

“Back when he founded the Shunxi Financial Group, grandfather Ye’s biggest investor had 60% of the Shunxi Financial Group’s shares.”

“Now that Grandfather Ye was gone, she was the biggest shareholder.”

“No matter how powerful the other party was, he had to bow his head in front of her!”

“Si lui turned to look at XI weiyue and explained, “Miss Zhao is the daughter of the financial group’s founder, elder Zhao. Elder Zhao is already very old and has temporarily taken a step back. Currently, Miss Zhao will be taking elder Zhao’s place.””
