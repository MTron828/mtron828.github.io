She didn’t expect Feng Xianxian to be so generous!

“”Really, Xianxian?”Bai Xiaoman said excitedly, “Can I go?” ”

“Feng Xianxian smiled and said, “Of course you can. Isn’t it just a meal?” ”

“”Xianxian, thank you!” ”

Bai Xiaoman was very happy now. She knew that she was holding onto the right thigh.

“It was only the first day of school, and Feng Xianxian had already invited her to eat at a Michelin restaurant! ”

The Michelin restaurant was already here.

Would it be far to introduce her to a rich second-generation boyfriend?

“Ye Zhuo and Li Yueyue, those two country bumpkins who ate spicy hot soup, would definitely be envious of her! ”

Those two people would only be worthy of eating spicy hot soup for the rest of their lives.

“In a short while, takeout arrived. ”

Ye Zhuo accompanied Li Yueyue to get takeout.

The two of them ate and chatted in the living room.

“In a short while, Li Yueyue changed the way she addressed ye Zhuo from “First name”to “Burning”. ”

She realized that she really liked ye Zhuo.

Ye Zhuo was not the same as the cold and aloof beauty she imagined.

The spicy hot soup was very fragrant. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“The spicy and spicy taste was very strong. In a short while, the fragrance drifted into the bedroom through the living room. ”

The alluring fragrance made people unable to help but swallow their saliva.

Bai Xiaoman was so hungry that she couldn’t wait to order one immediately to quench her craving.

Feng Xianxian wasn’t any better either.

But she was constantly numbing herself.

She told herself.

That kind of cheap junk food was eaten by lower-class people. A noble princess like her should go to a five-star restaurant and eat foie gras Australian Dragon King Crab.

“After eating the spicy hot pot, the two of them returned to the dormitory. ”

Li Yueyue took out a bag of white stuff from her bag. “This is our specialty. Authentic milk slices can’t be bought in the capital. Try It and see how it tastes!”

“Looking at the milk slices that Li Yueyue handed over, Feng Xianxian’s eyes were filled with disgust. ”

Could this kind of junk food really be eaten?

“Feng Xianxian was about to refuse when she suddenly changed her words. “Thank you, Yueyue.” ”

“You’re welcome.”

“Seeing that Feng Xianxian had accepted it, Bai Xiaoman did not dare to refuse and thanked her as well. ”

Ye Zao peeled a piece of milk slice and put it into his mouth.

The milk fragrance was rich.

It was sweet but not greasy. The taste was indeed not bad.

“”Zao Zao, is it Delicious?”Li Yueyue looked at ye Zao. ”

“It’s very good.”

Li Yueyue was especially happy to receive ye Zao’s affirmation.

The next day was half a month of military training.

“At seven o’clock, ye Zao got up to wash up and change into a camouflage suit. ”

The camouflage suit of the capital university was a yellowish-brown desert camouflage suit.

Both men and women were the same color.

“The color of this desert camouflage suit was a little dark, and the size was not standard. People with slightly darker skin would not be able to suppress it at all. ”

“However, Ye Zao was different. ”

“She was tall and had outstanding facial features. When she wore the broad camouflage uniform, she had the innocence and liveliness of a girl of her age, as well as the valiant bearing of a female soldier. ”

Her legs were straight and slender.

She was extremely cool.

“When she saw ye Zao come out, Li Yueyue said in surprise, “Oh my God! Zao Zao! You look too good in camouflage! I suspect that we are not wearing the same camouflage uniform!” ”

Li Yueyue’s figure was a little petite.

“She had the figure of a Lolita. With her big sister’s face and loose camouflage uniform, she looked bloated. ”

“She was obviously 1.6 meters tall, but at this moment, she did not even look 1.5 meters tall. ”

God knows how much she envied ye Zao now.

Ye Zao leaned over and helped Li Yueyue adjust her collar. “You look good in this outfit too.”

“Really?”Li Yueyue did not expect to hear the word “Good-looking”from ye Zhuo’s mouth.

“After all, Ye Zhuo was a great beauty. ”

Li Yueyue was still very happy to hear her words from the mouth of a great beauty.

“Of course it’s true.”

“Li Yueyue continued, “I have sunscreen here. Do you want to apply some?” ”

Ye Zhuo shook his head and declined.

“Li Yueyue asked in puzzlement, “Why not? Aren’t you afraid of getting a tan?” ”

“Ye Zao said, “It’s too troublesome to remove makeup even after applying this.” ”

Li Yueyue:”...”

“In order to show her face on the military training field, Feng Xianxian specially got up at six o’clock to put on makeup and sunscreen. ”

She had just finished putting on makeup when she saw ye Zao and Li Yueyue coming out of the bathroom after changing into camouflage clothes.

“Her gaze fell on Ye Zhuo, and her expression turned ugly for a moment. ”

“She had been applying her makeup on her face for more than an hour, but it was actually not as good as ye Zhuo’s bare face! ”

Little B * Tch!

It was really too good for her!

She actually grew such a beautiful skin.

“But fortunately, the military training lasted for a total of fifteen days. ”

“It rarely rained in the capital, and the temperature was high. The Sun was scorching hot! ”
