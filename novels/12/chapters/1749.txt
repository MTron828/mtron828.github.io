“At the same time, Tina’s voice came through the earpiece. ”

“Hearing this, Feng Ying narrowed her eyes, she immediately changed her words, “Grandma, if you don’t want to go to country C, then I won’t go either. I’ll stay at home to accompany you. Don’t worry, I won’t be like my mother and let you stay in China alone.” ”

“The old lady’s expression changed when she heard this. She continued, “Really?” ”

“”Of course it’s true! Grandma, when have I ever lied to You?” ”

“”Okay.”What did people fear most when they were old? Loneliness, of course! The old lady was relieved when she saw that Feng Ying was willing to stay in China. ”

“At this moment, the old lady seemed to have thought of something. She looked at Feng Ying and continued, “You have to promise me one more condition.” ”

“”Grandma, please say that as long as I can do it, I will definitely promise you!” ”

“The old lady continued, “You have to promise me that you will never leave China! You can not betray China! You are born a Chinese, and you will die a Chinese soul!” ”

Feng Ying hesitated.

“After a moment, she said, “Okay Grandma, I Promise You!” ”

“”Then swear,”the old lady looked at Feng Ying and said, “If you follow in your mother’s footsteps, you will be struck by lightning!” ”

Feng Ying was forced into a corner by the old lady. She could only raise her fingers and swear.

What was there to be afraid of?

“It was already the twenty-first century, and the city had installed lightning rods. Could she really be struck by lightning? ”

“Seeing Feng Ying swear, the old lady was finally satisfied. ”

“Feng Ying smiled and said, “Grandmother, are you relieved now? By the way, are you up now? I’ll help you freshen up.” ”

“Okay.”The old lady nodded.

“Feng Ying followed the old lady into the house and helped the old lady change her clothes, wash her face, and comb her hair. ”

The 89-year-old old lady’s hair was almost completely white. Feng Ying held the old lady’s hair and felt a little sad.

“After all, the old lady was the one who raised her single-handedly. ”

“”Grandma, you were the one who combed my hair when I was young. Now it’s finally my turn to comb your hair,”feng ying continued, “I haven’t made any great achievements overseas, and I’ve been too ashamed to come back to see you. Don’t be angry. Don’t worry, Wang Hu, I’ll never leave you for the rest of my life.” ” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Feng Ying didn’t lie.

“All these years, she had always been the same. If Feng Qi hadn’t sent her money, she wouldn’t even have been able to maintain her basic food and clothing. ”

“It wasn’t that she didn’t have talent in design, but that she lacked talent and appreciation. ”

“Therefore, this time, she must seize the opportunity and seize it well. Only when she stood high up could she see far ahead. When she became a high-ranking official, she wouldn’t have to look at others. ”

The old lady sighed. “The past is in the past. It will get better in the future.”

“”Okay.”Feng Ying smiled at herself in the mirror and said, “By the way, grandma, Can I use this clip to clip your hair? Or this one?” ”

“The old lady smiled and said, “Any one will do.” ”

“”Then this one.”Feng Ying picked up a red flower-shaped hair clip and said, “I think this red one suits your skin color best.” ”

“The old lady was a beauty when she was young. Although she was old now, her temperament was still there. ”

“Beauty lies in the bones, not in the skin. ”

“”Okay.”The old lady nodded. “Xiao Ying, what’s that on Your Ear?” ”

“”Headphones, listening to music,”Feng Ying explained. ”

“OH.”

“In order to avoid suspicion from the old lady, Feng Ying took off her headphones and continued, “Grandma, I’m not listening to music anymore. I’ll accompany you to have a good chat and make up for the past ten years.” ”

“The old lady continued, “Xiao Ying, have you had a family overseas these years?” ”

“”No,”Feng Ying continued, “You’re my only grandmother. If I had a family outside, how could I not inform you?” ”

Marriage was no longer popular among young people in the west.

They lived together and solved each other’s biological needs. There were no financial disputes and no children.

Feng Ying liked this kind of life very much.

“She did not like being tied down and did not like children. Other than pursuing her ideals, this was also the reason why she had always lived abroad. ”

“You are not young anymore. Why don’t Grandma Get Someone to help you look for someone?”The old lady continued.

“”No need, grandma. I just want to be filial to you now. I don’t want to think about anything else.” ”

“Hearing this, the old lady’s mouth was full of smiles. She continued, “There’s no conflict between being in a relationship and being filial. If you have this intention, grandma will be satisfied.” ”
