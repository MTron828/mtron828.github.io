“It was originally a very fragrant smell, but when he breathed, he smelled a sweet and sickly feeling. ”

That feeling was as if it was placed in the clouds.

“At the same time, there was an inexplicable heat burning in his body. ”

It was very strange.

“Officer Wang turned to look at officer yin and said in a low voice, “Do you feel that the smell here is a little strange?” ”

“Officer Yin nodded. “Yes, I can smell it.” ”

“Officer Yin seemed to have thought of something and continued, “Quickly cover your nose. There is an aphrodisiac component in this incense.” ”

Officer Yin had handled many cases of selling yin. The common tactic of these street girls was to use aphrodisiacs to keep the customers.

The young people were fine.

Many of the older people were affected because of this. They lost their integrity in front of the street girls and brought shame to their children.

“Hearing this, officer Wang immediately covered his mouth and nose. ”

The two continued to walk inside.

“When they reached a room, the door was ajar. ”

“Officer Wang and officer Yin looked at each other for a moment. Then, Officer Yin kicked open the door. ”

Bang!

The force was so strong that the ground shook.

“Li Shuyi, who was inside, was also stunned. ”

It seemed that Cen Wuye’s medicine had already taken effect!

Linda had said that this drug effect was very strong.

Even a 500-pound strong man could still be knocked down and lose his mind in a daze.

There were no other women in this room.

When the time came...

“Thinking of that scene, and thinking of Cen Shaoqing’s eyes and brows, Li Shuyi’s face became even redder. ”

“If she could conceive fifth master Cen’s child in one go, that would be even better! ”

“Once she was pregnant with fifth master Cen’s child, she would be the Cen family’s mistress without a doubt. ”

As for Ye Zhuo.

Where did he come from? !

Not everyone could compare to her.

“Li Shuyi could not wait any longer. She walked out barefooted and greeted, “Fifth Master.” ”

“Her speed was extremely fast. Due to inhaling the incense, she did not pay attention to her surroundings and almost hugged officer Wang. ”

Li Shuyi was not wearing anything. She was white. Officer Wang dodged and avoided Li Shuyi’s hug.

“Police!”

“When she saw the person standing in front of her, Li Shuyi was stunned! ”

It was not Cen Wuye!

“Not only was it not Cen Wuye, but it was a police officer in uniform. ”

What was going on?

“At this moment, Li Shuyi almost thought she was hallucinating. ”

Who called the police?

Why did the police appear here?

What happened!

“”Ah!”Li Shuyi screamed as she reacted. She covered her body with her hands and ran inside. In a panic, she wrapped the blanket around her body and hid by the bed. “Get Out! Hurry up and get out! Ah!” ”

“When she thought about how she had been seen naked by the two police officers just now, Li Shuyi felt extremely uncomfortable. A sense of humiliation overwhelmed her. ”

Officer Wang and officer Yin immediately ran over. They took out the handcuffs on their waists and cuffed Li Shuyi. “Don’t move! Police!”

“What right do you have to arrest me?”

“Don’t tell me the police can just randomly arrest people?”

“Li shuyi shouted angrily, “Let go of me! I’m going to sue you for breaking and entering!” ” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Who Was It?

It had to be Li Yueyue!

“Li Yueyue knew of her plan and was jealous of her, so she called the police. ”

“Otherwise, why would the police come here for no reason? ”

B * Tch!

Li Yueyue was a B * Tch!

“Officer Wang said, “Someone reported that someone sold yin here. Please come with US for investigation!” ”

Sold Yin?

Li Yueyue’s face turned pale. The burning desire in her heart was extinguished in an instant.

How dare Li Yueyue frame her like this.

Where is Cen Wuye!

Where is Cen Wuye?

Cen Wuye quickly came to save her.

“After subduing Li Shuyi, officer Li called two assistants to collect evidence at the scene. ”

Li Yueyue prepared a lot of tools.

“There were whips, Viagra, and uniforms. These were the tools that Li Yueyue wanted to use in bed, but now they were all evidence of her selling yin and sexual harassment. ”

“Seeing her assistant collect all the things, Li Shuyi was flustered. ”

“”It’s a misunderstanding, officers. This is a misunderstanding! How can I be a streetwalker! “I’m the girlfriend of the owner of this room. I’m just waiting for my boyfriend to come back! “Is it illegal to wait for my boyfriend to come back in his room?” ”

“After saying that, Li Shuyi continued, “Officers, please believe me. I’m really not lying!” ”

“Although she was not Cen Shaoqing’s girlfriend yet, she would become CEN Shaoqing’s girlfriend one day. ”
