The three watermelons weighed 70 catties.

70 catties was less than one-third of the weight of the barbell.

How could they compare?

“Zhou Xiang said, “Although it can’t be compared to the barbell, it can at least prove that Zha Zha is stronger than an ordinary girl.” ”

“”Of course!”Old Mrs. Cen raised her head proudly. “Otherwise, why did I personally choose my granddaughter-in-law? My granddaughter-in-law is the best granddaughter-in-law in the world! and the most outstanding granddaughter-in-law in the world!” ”

“Zhou xiang smiled and continued, “Then can we wait for the matter between Zhuozhuo and Shaoqing?” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen nodded. “Yes, we’ll wait for a while.” ”

“Zhou Xiang hesitated for a moment and then said, “It doesn’t matter if it’s a boy or a girl. After all, Zhuozhuo is a girl. Do you think that if we don’t mention this matter, Zhuozhuo’s parents will misunderstand that we don’t value Zhuozhuo?” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen smiled and said, “Don’t worry. I will explain this matter to Ah Shu and Jin city. They are reasonable people. As parents, they also want to stay in Luoluo for a few more years.” ”

“Okay.”Zhou Xiang nodded.

“Cen Shaoqing, who was in the gym upstairs, did not know that he worked so hard to keep fit so that he could live a harmonious life in the future. However, old Mrs. Cen had delayed their wedding date because of this. ”

...

Today was Sunday. Ye Zao did not go out of the Lin family manor.

“At this moment, he was sitting in the rose garden with an easel in front of him. ”

On the easel was a half-finished painting.

In the background was an endless stretch of roses. The back of a long-haired girl was looking up into the distance.

“”Zao Zao.”At this moment, a gentle female voice came from behind him. ”

“Ye Zhuo turned his head slightly and saw Xia Xiaoman. “Fourth aunt, when did you come?” ”

“”I just arrived.”Xia Xiaoman’s gaze fell on Ye Zhuo’s painting. She asked in surprise, “Zhuo Zhuo, did you draw this?” ”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “Yes.”

“”Your painting is really good.”Although Xia Xiaoman didn’t know much about painting, she could tell that ye Zhuo’s painting skill wasn’t something that an ordinary person could have. ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “Just drawing. Oh right, fourth aunt, is Lizi here too?” ”

“”She’s in front,”Xia Xiaoman replied. ”

“Ye Zhuo could see that Xia Xiaoman had something on her mind, so he continued, “Fourth aunt, let’s go to the gazebo in front and have a seat, shall we?” ”

“Okay.”Xia Xiaoman nodded.

The two of them went to the gazebo.

“The wind was a little strong today, and it made the beaded curtains on the gazebo jingle. ”

It was especially pleasing to the ear.

“Of course, it was pleasing to the ears of those who were in a good mood, but to Xia Xiaoman’s ears, it made her even more worried. ”

“Ye Zhuo poured a cup of tea for Xia Xiaoman. “Fourth aunt, is there something on your mind?” ”

“Xia Xiaoman took the tea that ye Zhuo handed over with both hands, took a sip, and then said, “Zhuozhuo, I know that your medical skills are very good, so I want to ask you for a favor.” ”

“”If you have something to say, just say it. We are a family.” ”

“Xia Xiaoman considered her words in her heart, then she said, “I have been married to your fourth uncle for a long time. I really want to give birth to his child, but there has been no movement. I went to the hospital for a check-up, and the Doctor said that I am fine. I want you to help me see if I am really fine.” ”

“Although Lin Qingxuan had always said that the matter of a child was not something to be forced, having an Lizi as a daughter was enough. ”

But Xia Xiaoman wanted to give birth to his child.

A child that belonged to them.

“Hearing the purpose of Ming Xia Xiaoman’s visit, ye Zao continued, “Fourth aunt, stretch out your hand. I’ll Take Your Pulse.” ”

Xia Xiaoman immediately stretched out her hand towards ye Zao.

Ye Zao stretched out his hand and placed it on Xia Xiaoman’s pulse.

“A moment later, he let go of her hand. ”

“Xia Xiaoman immediately asked, “Zao Zao, how is it?” ”

“Ye Zao said, “From your pulse, it seems that there are no problems with your body. You shouldn’t be too anxious. There are some things that can not be rushed. Just let nature take its course.” ”

“Hearing that her body was fine, Xia Xiaoman heaved a sigh of relief. She smiled and said, “It’s good that you’re fine.” ”

“Ye Zhuo’s medical skills were very good. He could even cure cancer. Now That Ye Zhuo had said that there was no problem, there was definitely no problem. ” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“After saying that, ye Zhuo continued, “By the way, fourth aunt, have you taken birth control pills before?” ”

“No.”Xia Xiaoman shook her head.

Never taken birth control pills before?

Ye Zhuo frowned slightly. Could it be that she had heard wrongly?

Ye Zhuo reached out and placed his hand on Xia Xiaoman’s wrist again.

He had not heard wrongly.

“According to Xia Xiaoman’s pulse, she had taken birth control pills before. ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Fourth aunt, although you have never taken birth control pills before, you must have eaten food with birth control pills before. Nowadays, many vegetables are sprayed with phytohormones, which is very bad for the human body. You might not be able to tell anything from some young people with good physiques, but you are different. When you were giving birth to Lizi, you did not give birth properly. Now, you have eaten vegetables sprayed with phytohormones, which causes you to be unable to get pregnant.” ”
