“Young master Li!”The girl stood up and hugged Li Qiandong.

“Get lost!”Li Qiandong’s face immediately turned black as he shook off the girl’s hand.

“Seeing that Li Qiandong was really angry, the girl jumped in fright. She hurriedly changed her clothes and ran out of the bedroom as if she was escaping. ”

“When she passed by the living room, the girl glanced at Mu Yourong who was sitting on the sofa. ”

Li Qiandong changed his face as he said so. She had thought that some coquettish slut had come.

So that was all there was to it.

It was clear and watery.

How could it be half as charming and moving as her?

Li Qiandong’s taste was really terrible!

“When the girl was sizing up Mu Yourong, Mu Yourong also raised her head and glanced at her. ”

Her eyes were filled with ridicule.

So what if she was beautiful?

So what if she slept with Li Qiandong?

“In Li Qiandong’s heart, she was still the most important person. ”

“Even if she did not do anything, that Idiot Li Qiandong was willing to give up everything for her. ”

Three minutes later.

Li Qiandong walked out of the room neatly dressed and poured mu yourong a cup of water.

“”Thank you, Big Brother Li.” ”

Mu Yourong took the cup of water with both hands.

“”You’re welcome.”Li Qiandong continued, “Yourong, did you encounter some difficulties?” ”

“Hearing this, Mu Yourong immediately cried out, “Big Brother Li...” ”

“”What’s Wrong?”Seeing Mu Yourong Cry, Li Qiandong’s heart ached terribly. ”

“Mu Yourong immediately hugged Li Qiandong, crying as she said, “Big Brother Li, someone is targeting our family, and our family is going bankrupt... Big Brother Li, what should I do?” ”

Mu Yourong was a smart person.

“Since she couldn’t meet Li Qiandong by chance, and since he had taken the initiative to find her, instead of hiding it, she might as well get straight to the point. ”

“Li Qiandong’s body instantly stiffened as he comforted her, “Yourong, don’t worry. You’re So Kind, your family will definitely not go bankrupt! I’ll help you!” ”

“Really?”Mu Yourong raised her head to look at Li Qiandong with tears in her eyes. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Li Qiandong reached out to help mu yourong wipe her tears. “Really, yourong, don’t cry. This small matter isn’t worth your tears.” ”

“Mu Yourong was moved as she hugged Li Qiandong. “Big Brother Li, thank you.”She knew that Li Qiandong, this stepping stone, would not disappoint her. From an angle that Li Qiandong could not see.., the corners of Mu Yourong’s mouth curled up into a sinister arc. ”

“It’s my duty.”

“MU yourong continued, “Oh right, Big Brother Li, can you help me investigate who is targeting our mu group?” ”

“”That’s for sure. Even if you don’t say it, I will investigate.”He really wanted to see just who would dare to lay their hands on the Grand Elder! ”

Did he not know that he had the support of the Mu Group?

Mu Yourong knew that Li Qiandong would definitely help her vent her anger.

“Once it was discovered that it was ZY, not only the Li Corporation, even fifth master Cen would probably take action to suppress it. ”

“Compared to the CEN Corporation, ZY was nothing? ”

“At that time, the person on the verge of bankruptcy would be ye Zhuo! ”

“Thinking of this, Mu Yourong felt extremely happy! ”

“Ye Zhuo, that little slut, dared to fight with her? ”

She really overestimated herself.

Mu Yourong returned home.

Big Soldier Mu welcomed her.

“Knowing what big soldier Mu wanted to ask, Mu yourong smiled and said, “Father, don’t worry. Young Master Li has already promised me that he will immediately invest in our company. He will also send someone to inform the local tax bureau.” ”

“Hearing this, big soldier mu heaved a sigh of relief. ”

“As expected, his daughter was really capable! ”

“After sending Mu Yourong back to the Mu family, Li Qiandong called his secretary. “Hello, is this little Wang?” ”

“”It’s me, young master Li.” ”

“Li Qiandong instructed, “I want to invest in the MU group. In addition, sign the two recent major projects of the company to the MU Group.” ”

“”Yes, young master Li.” ”

“After the secretary hung up the phone, he went to do some work. ”

Ten minutes later.

Li Qiandong received a call from his secretary again. “Has the matter been settled?”

“The Secretary hesitated for a moment before continuing, “I’m sorry, Young Master Li. Your position has been revoked by the chairman, so you are temporarily unable to invest in the MU group. You also don’t have the right to decide on the company’s cooperation.” ”

“What did you say?”Li Qiandong suspected that he was hearing things.

The Secretary repeated what he had just said.

Only then did Li Qiandong believe that he had not heard wrongly. He immediately called Father Li.

He questioned why father Li wanted to revoke his position.

Father Li immediately cursed loudly:

“”You Prodigal Son, you still have the face to ask me! Don’t you think about what stupid things you have done during your time in Yunjing? ! All you do is drink and play with women! You lost 500 million last time! And Now You’re throwing money at the MU group! I’m not spending my money to raise women for you!” ”
