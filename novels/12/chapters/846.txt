“Chapter 847: 186: losing to an opponent like Miss Ye, I’m completely convinced! 1”

“Old Mrs. Cen said without hesitation, “I’m not selling.” ”

The old master thought for a moment and then stretched out five fingers. “I’m willing to offer this amount.”

Five hundred thousand.

The Old Master had operated the gallery for many years.

He could tell at a glance that the value of this painting in the future was far beyond five hundred thousand.

Old Mrs. Cen smiled and shook her head. “I won’t sell it even if you offer 500 million yuan.”

“The old master thought that old Mrs. Cen was complaining that the price was too low, so he quickly added, “If you feel that the price is not enough, we can discuss it again.” ”

“It’s not about the price. I really won’t sell this painting.”

“The old master continued, “Didn’t you say that this painting was painted by your granddaughter-in-law? Sell it to me and let your granddaughter-in-law paint another one.” ”

“The old lady said, “Painting also requires time and energy. I don’t want to tire my precious granddaughter-in-law.” ”

“Seeing that the old lady really didn’t want to sell it, the old master didn’t say anything more. ”

“After the painting was mounted, Old Lady Cen took the painting to a place. ”

Half an hour later.

Old Lady Cen appeared in a teahouse.

Sitting opposite her was a sage-like old man.

“The old man looked to be in his seventies or eighties. He wore a tang suit and looked at Old Lady Cen. “Sister Tang, you asked me to come here today. Do you have something important to say?” ”

“This old man was the elder of the traditional Chinese painting world, Qi Ziyue. ”

“Old Lady Cen did not say anything. She handed the painting scroll in her hand to elder qi and said, “Take a look at this.” ”

“Elder qi asked curiously, “Is this a painting?” ”

“Just take a look and you’ll find it.”

“Elder Qi opened the painting scroll. The expression in his eyes changed from indifference to shock. Finally, he asked in disbelief, “You painted this painting?” ”

“As an elder of the Chinese art world, when he saw this painting again, elder Qi seemed to have seen the future of the Chinese art world. ”

“Old Granny Cen smiled and said, “I haven’t touched my brush for more than twenty years. How can I still paint such a painting?” ”

“Then who painted it?”Elder Qi was very curious.

“There was a hint of pride in old Granny Cen’s eyes. “My granddaughter-in-law painted it. How is it? It’s still passable, right?” ”

Passable?

How could such a drawing be called passable?

It was simply a stroke of genius.

“Old Lady Qi said in disbelief, “It was really drawn by your granddaughter-in-law?”It was not the first time that Old Lady Cen had mentioned the word ‘granddaughter-in-law’, but at first, Old Lady Qi did not take it to heart. ”

She did not expect that this little girl had such a great talent!

“Old Lady Cen said speechlessly, “What? Can I still lie to You? Can I get a coke if I Lie to You?” ”

Elder Qi smiled and didn’t say anything.

Old Lady Cen had been a bit off-key since she was young.

He was afraid that Old Lady Cen was teasing him.

“It could be seen from this painting that the person who painted was calm, meticulous, and very patient. ”

This kind of patience was not something a young person could have.

The most important thing was the foundation.

“Without decades of painting experience, one would not be able to draw with this kind of foundation. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Do you really think I’m joking with You?” ”

“Elder Qi stroked his beard. “Sister Tang, the 27th of next month is the day of the election for the President of the Association. Why Don’t you bring your granddaughter-in-law along?” ”

Old Lady Cen looked at elder Qi. “Why? Are you going to be my granddaughter-in-law’s President?”

President?

Not just anyone could be the president of the association.

“As an elder of the Chinese art world, elder Qi naturally wouldn’t agree to such a thing. He smiled and said, “Sister Tang, you haven’t been to the Chinese art world for many years. You can also come and participate in this art exhibition.” ”

“”Sure, no problem.”Old Madam Cen agreed without hesitation. She added, “But I can’t guarantee whether my granddaughter-in-law can go or not. If she’s not free, then I’ll go alone.” ”

“Sure.”Elder Qi nodded.

...

On the other side.

Baron had been attacking the world’s database for the past few days.

He had changed three computers.

“However, the progress bar was still 1% . ”

This made Baron very depressed.

“Since he debuted at the age of 16, other than the famous Z, no one had made him suffer such a setback. ”

In a fit of anger.

Baron contacted his good brother in C country and prepared to work with his good brother to attack from both sides and break the firewall.

“Baron’s brother was called William, and he was a very powerful hacker. William had brought Baron into the hacker world. ”

“Over the years, the two of them had a very good relationship. ” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“When he received a call from Baron, he was very surprised. “There’s such technology in China?” ”
