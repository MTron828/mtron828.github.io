Chapter 163: 085: Lovely Old Mrs. Cen, my granddaughter-in-law is the most beautiful woman in the world! 7

As soon as the Doorbell Rang, Lin Shasha rushed over to open the door.

“Burning!”

“Sister Shasha.”

“Come in, I bought your favorite macarons, souffles, doughnuts, and Tiramisu!”Lin Shasha pulled ye Zao’s hand and walked in.

Ye Zao hugged Lin Shasha excitedly, “Sister Shasha, you’re So Nice!”

“I knew you liked these. But you eat so many desserts, aren’t you afraid of gaining weight?”

Ye Zao said fearlessly, “If you gain weight, then lose weight!”Moreover, this body seemed to be the same as her in her previous life. It was not easy to gain weight. No matter how much she ate, her body was still hot!

After finishing the desserts, ye Zao began to review Lin Sha’s homework.

Lin Sha’s liberal arts was okay.

Her science results were not too good.

She only got 210 points in math, physics, and chemistry.

However, ye Zao firmly believed that there were no students who could not teach, only teachers who did not work hard.

She had her own teaching method.

......

Although she usually laughed and laughed with her friends, when it came to serious matters, she could be as serious as she wanted to be.

For example, now.

Lin Sha did not even dare to breathe heavily as she listened to ye Zao’s lecture seriously. The strange thing was that the content that she could not understand from other tutoring teachers became extremely smooth in front of ye Zao.

It was like a gurgling stream.

Before she knew it, it was already afternoon.

The first thing Zhou Xiang did when she went shopping and came home was to tell old Mrs. Cen about her encounter today. “Mom! Let me tell you! I met an extremely beautiful girl today! She is even more beautiful than a sinking fish!”

It was rare to hear her praise others from Zhou Xiang’s mouth, but it was quite rare today.

One had to know that in Zhou Xiang’s eyes, song Chenyu was usually the most beautiful person in the world!

Old Mrs. Cen was stunned. “More beautiful than that fish? is that more beautiful than my granddaughter-in-law’s leaf?”?

Zhou Xiang said excitedly, “Although I haven’t seen the leaf you mentioned, I can guarantee that it’s definitely more beautiful than the leaf!”

“Nonsense!”Old Mrs. Cen frowned, “No matter how good looking she is, she can’t be better looking than the leaf! My leaf is the most beautiful in the world! The most beautiful in the universe! Everyone loves it, it’s devastatingly beautiful!”

In old Mrs. Cen’s eyes, Ye Zao was the most beautiful existence in the universe.

If anyone dared to say that ye Zao was not beautiful, she would be angry with them!

Even her own daughter-in-law couldn’t do it!

“Mom, you are too unreasonable! Zao Zao is so beautiful, how can she not be compared to a leaf?”Zhou Xiang really could not think of what a person who was more beautiful than ye Zao would look like.

The old lady was too good at bragging.

“How can you talk like that? Who are you calling a leaf?”Old Mrs. Cen put her hands on her hips.

Zhou Xiang did not show any weakness. “Then you always say that the sunken fish is a fish! Why, only the state officials are allowed to set fire, and not the people are allowed to light the lamps?”

Old Mrs. Cen choked. She was so angry that her cheeks were puffed up. She pointed at Zhou Xiang and said, “You are the leaf! Your whole family is the leaf!”

Zhou Xiang raised his eyebrows slightly. “Hehe, you say that as if you and I are not a family.”

Old Mrs. Cen:”...”thinking of her illustrious reputation, she had never lost a quarrel before. This time, she was actually involved in it!

How embarrassing!

She was so angry!

“I don’t care! Leaves are the most beautiful! The most beautiful in the universe. That Zhuo Zhuo of yours can’t even compare to one of my leaves’little fingers!”As she said that, old Mrs. Cen climbed onto the coffee table and looked at Zhou Xiang.

Although she was a little short.

She couldn’t lose to her imposing manner!

The coffee table couldn’t do it, but she still had the ceiling to climb on!

Zhou Xiang also placed her hands on her hips and imitated old Mrs. Cen. “A leaf, and you still want to compete with my burning? She can’t even compare to a single strand of burning hair!”

“You’re creating something out of nothing, making things up in secret, imagining things out of thin air, making things up out of thin air, being speechless, and incurable! There’s something wrong with your brain, and there’s no end to it!”Old Mrs. Cen was so angry that her face was red, she said a long string of words without even taking a breath, “My Yezi is the most beautiful woman in the world! That bullsh * T Zhuo Zhuo of yours, she, she can’t even compare to Yezi’s fingernails!” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Zhou Xiang raised her eyebrows and suddenly had a plan in her heart. “Mom, why don’t we call her over to our house and have a face-to-face comparison? Who’s Prettier?”Old Mrs. Cen had talked about Yezi for such a long time, but Zhou Xiang had not seen it once, his heart was really filled with curiosity.

Old Mrs. Cen nodded. “Sure! Let’s let five — no! Let Shaoqing be the referee.”

“Sure.”Zhou xiang continued, “When do we make the appointment?”
