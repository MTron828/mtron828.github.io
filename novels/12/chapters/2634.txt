“At this moment, the Butler walked over and said, “Madam, there are some things that I have wanted to say for a long time.” ”

“Hearing the Butler’s voice, Zhou Cui Hua grabbed her life-saving straw and immediately said, “Butler Zheng Xuan did not lie to me, right?” ”

“The butler sighed, “Actually, we were all actors that he hired. We all signed a confidentiality agreement with him for a month and a half.” ”

“What did you say?”Zhou cuihua’s expression immediately changed.

“The Butler took out the confidentiality agreement and continued, “This is the contract that we signed at that time.” ”

Li Hang took the contract.

It was written in black and white on the contract. All of this was just an act.

“A few seconds later, the butler continued, “Our employment relationship with Mr. Wang ends today. Madam, do you want to leave with us? It will be more convenient if you follow our car later.” ”

“Although Li Hang had chauffeurs when he went out these days, those cars were all rented. ”

Wang Ting’s courtyard was very large. It would take about half an hour to walk out without a transport car. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Leave?

“Zhou Cuihua was stunned again. If they left this place, where could the mother and daughter go? ”

No.

They could not leave.

“Zhou Cuihua looked at the butler and said, “Butler, you’re joking with me, right? You must be joking with me...” ”

“The butler said, “I am not joking with you.” ”

“At this point, the butler paused and continued, “Actually, Wang Zhengxuan is a liar. It’s just that the both of you have not realized it.” ”

“After saying that, the butler turned around and left. ”

Zhou Cuihua’s strength seemed to have been sucked away at this moment. Her entire body went limp on the ground and she wailed loudly.

“Li hang stood at the side, also in a daze. He did not know what to do. ”

“Only after a few minutes did li hang come back to his senses. He pulled Zhou cuihua up from the ground. “Mom, Don’t cry. Let’s leave this place first.” ”

Zhou cuihua raised her head to look at Li Hang. “Where are we going?”

“Li Hang did not know where she could go at this moment. He continued, “Let’s leave this place first.” ”

“Zhou Cuihua was stunned for a moment before she reacted. She said in a hoarse voice, “I don’t want to leave!” ”

She had already lived here for a month. She was already familiar with the days of being served by the servants.

She did not want to leave this place.

She could not leave this place either.

“”If you don’t Leave Now, are you going to wait for others to kick you out?”Li hang continued, “Wang Zhengxuan is a liar!” ”

“”No, he’s not a liar! He said he wanted to marry me. She can’t be a liar!”Zhou cuihua immediately cried. ”

“Li hang continued, “Where did you say you met Wang Zhengxuan?” ”

“”At Xia Xiaoman’s house,”Zhou Cuihua said. ”

“Xia Xiaoman! It must be Xia Xiaoman!”Li hang seemed to have suddenly thought of something. “Let’s go find Xia Xiaoman Now!”

“At the mention of Xia Xiaoman, Zhou Cuihua immediately nodded. ”

The mother and daughter went upstairs to pack their things.

“In fact, apart from clothes, they had nothing else to take with them. ”

“When they left, Zhou Cuihua’s eyes were full of reluctance. ”

“She thought that she could live here forever, but who would have thought that her dream would be shattered so soon. ”

“Stop looking.”Li hang dragged her.

“Zhou cuihua wiped away the tears in her eyes. “Xia Xiaoman, that D * MN B * Tch! It must be her!” ”

“Needless to say, all of this was planned by Xia Xiaoman. ”

“After all, she had only met Wang Zhengxuan at Xia Xiaoman’s place. ”

Li hang frowned. “What’s the point of saying all this now? I knew that there was something wrong with this boss Wang. It was you who felt that your charm was limitless!”

“How could a big boss of a real estate company fall for a middle-aged woman like Zhou cuihua, who couldn’t stand up to the public? ”

“Even if one thought about it with their toes, they would know that it was impossible! ”

But Zhou Cuihua firmly believed it!

“”Am I the only one who was deceived?”Zhou cuihua looked at Li Hang. “Hang Hang, you have to speak and act with a conscience! Besides, you’ve even studied in university. You’re a top student! Have you read all these years into your dog’s stomach?” ”

Li Hang did not say a word.

It was all Wang Zhengxuan’s fault for being too good at scamming people.

“Until now, Li Hang still could not figure out what Wang Zhengxuan’s true intentions were. ”

“Money and sex, he really wanted the same thing! ”

But Wang Zhengxuan did not seem to want anything!

“Unless, all of this was Xia Xiaoman’s scheme. ”

The mother and daughter dragged their luggage and directly took a taxi to the entrance of the Lin family’s villa.

“Zhou cuihua put her hands on her hips and began to curse, “Xia Xiaoman, come out! You Bitch!” ”
