“Do your best, leave it to fate. ”

“As a doctor, he didn’t want to see such a young girl being taken away by cancer. ”

But he couldn’t do anything about it.

“At present, let alone China, even country P, which had developed medicine, couldn’t cure cancer. ”

“Father Zhao stood up from the ground, his face full of sorrow. ”

After a long while.

The father and son walked out of the Doctor’s office.

“Mother Zhao stood up immediately. “His father, what did the Doctor Say?” ”

“Father Zhao smiled and said, “It’s fine, it’s fine. The Doctor said that our Pingting’s condition isn’t too bad. As long as we cooperate with the treatment, she will definitely get better!” ”

Mother Zhao’s eyes instantly lit up. “Really?”

“Father Zhao was speechless and said, “Look at what you said. Would I still joke with you about something like this?” ”

“After saying that, Father Zhao smiled and said to Zhao pingting, “Pingting, don’t say any more disheartening words. Just cooperate with the doctor’s treatment properly.” ”

“Zhao Pingting was very clear about her own physical condition, but in order to avoid her parents’worry, she still nodded. ”

“Zhao Yingjun said, “Then I’ll go and handle the hospitalization procedures first.” ”

“Go ahead.”Father Zhao nodded.

Tang Jia followed Zhao Yingjun’s footsteps. “I’ll go with you.”

“Let’s go.”Zhao Yingjun held his wife’s hand.

The two of them walked to the first floor together.

“After nodding, the smile on Zhao Yingjun’s face immediately faded. ”

“Tang Jia frowned slightly and asked in a low voice, “Is little sister’s condition not too good?” ”

Zhao Yingjun held Tang Jia’s hand tightly.

“Tang Jia sighed and held Zhao Yingjun’s hand back. “Don’t worry, little sister is very lucky. She will definitely be able to get through this difficult time.” ”

“Walking out of the elevator, Zhao Yingjun took a deep breath and said in a voice that was close to crying, “The Doctor said that Pingting may only have three months left.” ”

Although she knew that cancer was equivalent to death.

Tang Jia was still shocked.

She could not imagine that the lively Zhao Pingting would disappear from her life after three months.

“How could this be? Didn’t dad say that little sister’s condition isn’t too bad?”

Zhao Yingjun shook his head. “We can only try radiation treatment now.”

“”It’s fine! It will definitely be fine!”Tang Jia continued, “Go and tell the doctor that we can use the best medicine and equipment! Little sister will definitely get better!” ”

“Zhao Yingjun hugged Tang Jia. “Tang Jia, thank you.” ”

He was very glad that he had married such a good wife like Tang Jia.

“If it was anyone else, they might not be as sensible and kind as Tang Jia. ”

“”What are you thanking me for! is little sister your sister and not my sister?”After living together for so long, in Tang Jia’s heart, Zhao Pingting was her biological sister. ”

“She was the same as her parents. As long as she could save Zhao Pingting, she was willing to do anything for her. ”

“After completing the hospitalization procedures, Zhao Pingting was admitted into the ward. ”

“There were a total of five beds in the ward, and all of them were patients with lung cancer. ”

“However, Zhao Pingting was the youngest. ”

“When they saw Zhao Pingting walk in wearing her hospital gown, the other four patients were all very surprised. ”

After arranging for her to be hospitalized.

“Mother Zhao said, “Yingjun, you and Tang Jia can go back first. Your father and I will be fine here.” ”

“Zhao pingting nodded. “That’s right. Big Brother, sister-in-law, you guys can go back first. There’s no use for so many of you to accompany me. There’s not even an extra stool here. Hurry up and go back.” ”

Tang Jia nodded. “Then we’ll go home first and make some food to send over.”

“Zhao Yingjun didn’t want to go back at first, but when he heard his wife say that, he followed her back. ”

“After Zhao Yingjun and Tang Jia left, the middle-aged woman who was staying in the hospital bed on Zhao Pingting’s right asked curiously, “Big Sister, was that your son and daughter-in-law just now?” ”

Zhao Pingting’s mother nodded. “Yes.”

“Is That Your Daughter?”The middle-aged woman continued to ask.

“Yes.”

The middle-aged woman looked at Zhao Pingting with a look of pity in her eyes. She had thought that she was very pitiful.

She was only 55 years old and already had cancer.

This little girl looked like she was only 18 or 19 years old.

Sigh!

“The middle-aged woman continued to say, “Big sister, don’t be anxious. Although it’s said that cancer isn’t easy to cure, now that medicine has developed, as long as you cooperate with the treatment, you will definitely recover!” ”

“”Yes, I will.”Mother Zhao nodded. ”

Father Zhao looked at Zhao Pingting. “Do you have anything that you really want to eat? Dad will buy it for you.”

Zhao Pingting shook her head.

“Then I will buy some fruits for you! I remember that you like eating mangosteen the most.”

“I will go with you.”Mother Zhao stood up.
