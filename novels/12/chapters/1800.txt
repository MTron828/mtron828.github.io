“She rarely mentioned such a request, and she rarely hugged her like this. Most of the time, he was the one who took the initiative. ”

“Cen Shaoqing was slightly stunned, and his body instantly stiffened. ”

“After a moment, CEN Shaoqing slowly said, “Leader?” ”

There was no response in the air.

“Leader?”Cen Shaoqing called out again.

There was still no response in the air.

Cen Shaoqing looked down and saw ye Zhuo’s thick fan-like eyelashes. His breathing was even.

Asleep?

Cen Shaoqing was stunned.

How tired was this person? How could he fall asleep like this?

Cen Shaoqing looked at her like this. His deep eyes were full of affection.

“”Fifth brother.”At this moment, footsteps sounded in the air. It was he ziteng’s voice. ”

Cen Shaoqing turned his eyes slightly. He put his index finger to his lips and made a silent gesture. “Shh.”

“He ziteng did not dare to speak. When he saw ye Zao in Cen Shaoqing’s arms, he immediately walked out and instructed the others not to come in and disturb the two of them. ”

Ye Zao had slept for a very long time and it was very fragrant. It had been a long time since she had slept so soundly.

This sleep was so comfortable!

“Ye Zao slowly opened his eyes. When he saw the scene in front of him, he was stunned. ”

“What greeted his eyes was a fair and beautiful chin. Looking down from the chin, he could see a sexy Adam’s apple, a moon-white button-down gown, and the top button was unbuttoned, there was a hint of coldness in the abstinence. ”

The scent of sandalwood that belonged exclusively to him permeated into his nose.

It smelled very good.

It was also at this moment that ye Zao remembered that she had fallen asleep while hugging Cen Shaoqing while eating.

So what time was it now?

Ye Zao looked up at the wall and saw that it was already past six o’clock the next morning.

“In other words, she had slept for more than ten hours. ”

Ye Zao was a little surprised.

“At this moment, the arm that was holding ye Zao’s back tightened, and a deep voice came from above. “You’re awake.” ”

“Yes.”

“How did you sleep last night?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“Very well. How about you?”Ye Zao still maintained the posture of leaning on his body.

“”I’m also... very well.”In fact, last night had really tormented him. ”

He was a very normal man. How could he not be flustered with such a gentle and soft woman in his arms?

“However, ye Zao had fallen asleep on his body. He could not move randomly, so he could only ask someone to send over ice water. ”

“In the end, he did not know how he fell asleep. ”

“When will you graduate?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“”Another year,”ye Zao said. ”

One year.

There was actually another year!

This meant that he had to be a monk for another year!

“Thinking of this, Cen Shaoqing’s expression was a little subtle. ”

“After saying this, ye Zao continued, “Why didn’t You Wake Me Up Last Night?”She had slept on Cen Shaoqing’s body for more than ten hours. She was comfortable, but Cen Shaoqing was definitely very tired. ”

“”Because I fell asleep too,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

“It was morning, and it was the time of excitement in a man’s body. He could not let ye Zhuo notice his strange behavior. Cen Shaoqing cleared his throat, then he said, “It’s already half past six. I’ll send you back. You can have breakfast on the way.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo let go of Cen Shaoqing’s waist. “I want to eat breakfast at tenderroad.”

“”Okay.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly and continued, “Then I’ll go wash up first.” ”

“I’ll go too.”

...

On the other side.

At the rice noodle shop.

“During this period of time, Xu Xiao had been coming to the rice noodle shop almost every day to check in. However, what made Xu Xiao depressed was that she had not seen he ziteng or Lin Ze for the past few days. ”

“Although she had added he ziteng on wechat, she could not go directly to he ziteng either. ”

Wouldn’t that be no different from throwing herself at him?

“Just as Xu Xiao was listless, a pleasant male voice suddenly appeared in the air. “Miss Xu.” ”

This voice.

It was so familiar!

“It must be he ziteng, who had disappeared for many days. ”

“Xu Xiao was very surprised, but her face did not show it. She raised her head and said, “Mr. HE, are you here for breakfast too?” ”
