It was also at this time.

“The Alarm in the Selead branch went off. At this time, everyone discovered that Carl had been openly taken away from the deputy executive officer’s Office! ”

The deputy executive officer had an emergency meeting at the last minute to discuss the way to save Carl.

“However, the other party did not leave any clues. In addition, Carl had offended too many people. There were more than ten fingers, so they needed to check one by one. ”

Therefore.

“In a short period of time, it was impossible to find out who took Carl Away! ”

“At this moment, chris stood out and said, “Deputy Executive Officer, Carl previously sent me a surveillance camera to fix it, but the person who hacked that surveillance camera was too clean. I studied it for a long time, but I still could not recover it. I think that Mr. Carl’s sudden disappearance may be related to the surveillance camera that was hacked.” ”

The deputy executive frowned. “What surveillance footage? Let me take a look!”

Chris took out his phone and handed it to the Deputy Executive.

“When the deputy executive saw this, his expression immediately changed. ”

“It’s him!”

Him?

Who was he? Everyone at the side looked puzzled.

“The deputy executive said, “It’s L! L’s Back! Carl’s disappearance has something to do with L!” ”

L?

The L who was ranked first among the hackers back then?

“Before anyone could react, the deputy executive officer immediately said, “Contact Miss Smith! Hurry up, Miss Smith!” ”

“”I’ll go right away,”Chris said. ”

“When Ye Zhuo received the news of Carl’s disappearance, it was already the next morning. ” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Carl’s disappearance was not a small matter.

“Ye Zhuo put down the work in his hands, said goodbye to Cen Shaoqing, and flew to C Nation. ”

“As soon as he got off the plane, he saw Bai Xiaosu standing at the airport entrance. ”

Bai Xiaosu was the only Chinese who got an A in the last assessment. He was extremely talented and had been promoted to the management of ABA.

“”Miss Ye!”Seeing ye Zao, Bai Xiaosu immediately waved at her. ”

Ye Zao held the suitcase with one hand and walked over quickly. “What’s going on?”

Bai Xiaosu explained everything in a concise manner.

Ye Zao frowned slightly. “Take me to the SELEAD branch immediately.”

“Bai Xiaosu was stunned for a moment before continuing, “Miss Ye, aren’t you going to the hotel to rest for a while?” ”

“No need.”

Bai Xiaosu nodded.

“About an hour or so later, the car stopped at the SELEAD branch. ”

“Because of Carl’s disappearance, the SELEAD branch was very busy. Carl was not a simple person in the Selead branch. His disappearance immediately alerted the higher-ups of the headquarters. The higher-ups sent a commissioner to investigate the matter thoroughly. ”

The Commissioner brought two top computer experts.

“At this moment, the two experts were busy restoring the surveillance cameras. ”

“After all, this was the only way to find Carl. ”

“Bai Xiaosu brought ye Zhuo to the Deputy Executive’s office. “Deputy Executive, this is Miss Ye.” ”

“”Hello, Miss Ye.”The deputy executive immediately stood up. ”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly and went straight to the point. “Where is the missing surveillance source code?”

“Over here.”The deputy executive stood up. “Follow me.”

Ye Zao followed the Deputy Executive’s footsteps and the few of them went to the office next door.

“In the office, two computer experts were typing furiously on their keyboards. ”

“The deputy executive walked to the Commissioner’s side, he lowered his voice and said, “Mr. Adar, this is Miss Ye. She’s the youngest executive in ABA and has a deep understanding of computers. Miss ye can restore the surveillance and help us find Carl.” ”

“After hearing the deputy executive officer’s words, the Commissioner Looked Ye Zao up and down. Then, he said in fluent F country’s official language, “Chinese?” ”

“The Commissioner felt that ye Zao did not understand F country’s language, so his tone was filled with contempt and sarcasm. “She can restore the surveillance? What a joke! The ABA is also down and out. How can anyone become an executive officer? !” ”
