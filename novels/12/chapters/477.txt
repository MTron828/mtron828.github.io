“Old Lady Lin said forcefully, “Jin Cheng, I don’t care what you are thinking right now. You have to give me an answer today.” ”

“”Mom, do you know about the diary?”Lin Jin Cheng raised his head to look at Old Lady Lin. ”

Old Lady Lin was stunned. “Diary? What Diary?”

“You really don’t Know?”Lin Jincheng asked.

“”I know?”Old Lady Lin frowned. “Jincheng, what do you think I Should Know?” ”

Lin Jincheng narrowed his eyes. He felt a headache and his head was about to explode.

“Old Lady Lin continued to pressure him. “Jincheng, I have already found a master. This month’s 18th is very good. I will make the decision to settle the matter between you and Qianhua First! We will hold the wedding in December!” ”

“After all, it was also a big wedding for the Lin family. Old Madam Lin wanted to hold a big one and make it more lively! ”

“Lin Jin Cheng pressed his temples. His expression was normal, but his face was covered in layers of cold sweat. ”

It was very uncomfortable.

“Old Madam Lin turned to look at Lin Jin Cheng. “If you don’t say anything, I’ll take it as your acquiescence.” ”

“After saying that, old madam Lin turned around and walked out of the door. ”

“Bang!”

“At this moment, the sound of a heavy object falling to the ground came from behind Old Madam Lin. ”

Old Madam Lin looked back and was so frightened that her face turned pale. “Jin Cheng!”

“She saw Lin Jin Cheng lying on the ground, unconscious. ”

“Help! Help!”

“Immediately, medical staff rushed in. ”

“After some resuscitation, Lin Jin Cheng finally regained consciousness, but his complexion was worse than before. ”

“Old Lady Lin sat by the bed. “Jin Cheng, give Qianhua an explanation. Qianhua needs you, and Xianxian needs you.” ”

“After saying that, old lady lin continued, “Anyway, I’ve already set the date. It’s on the 18th of this month! Rest well for the next few days. You’ll be in good spirits when you attend the engagement party.” ”

“After saying that, Old Lady Lin explained something to the doctor before leaving the sanatorium. ”

Back at the Lin family home.

Old Mrs. Lin began to arrange the happy occasion on the 18th.

She had to cut the Gordian knot quickly and settle things while Lin Jincheng was still in a daze.

..

Beijing University.

“After the military training ended, it was the orientation party. ”

“Today was Monday, which was also the day of the orientation party. ”

“Originally, the school had arranged for ye Zhuo to speak on behalf of the new students. ”

“But Ye Zao refused, so the school went to find Lin Ze. Like Ye Zao, Lin Ze was not interested in these things. ”

“Helplessly, the school had to find someone else. ”

“After the new students spoke, the school also arranged for the famous entrepreneurs in Beijing to go on stage and share their successful experiences. ”

“Bai Xiaoman sat next to Feng Xianxian and looked at the stage curiously. “Xianxian, do you know this old Mr. Yang?” ”

“Feng Qianxian nodded, her eyes filled with pride. “Not only do I know Grandpa Yang, but I’ve also had dinner with him at the dinner table. He and my grandmother are old friends for many years!” ”

“As she spoke, Feng Qianxian looked in the direction of ye Zao. ”

Ye Zao was sitting in the same row as her.

It was obvious that ye Zao must have heard her voice.

“At this moment, ye Zao must be very envious of her! ”

So what if ye Zao snatched away her position as the school belle?

Her status and position was something that ye Zao could never have imagined!

“She could get to know Old Master Yang, who was also from a wealthy family. ”

Could Ye Zao?

“She was the eldest daughter of the Lin family. In the future, she would marry Cen Wu Ye and become the Honorable Cen family’s matriarch. ”

Ye Zao could only marry a lowly person and spend his entire life fighting for a house and a car!

“Upon hearing this, Bai Xiaoman said enviously, “Xianxian, is that true? Did you really have dinner with old Mr. Yang?” ”

That was the Yang Corporation!

“A famous brand in the country, the Yang Corporation that produced the top ten famous wines! ”

One had to know that Bai Xiaoman usually only saw old Mr. Yang on television.

“”It’s just a meal. Is it really hard to believe?”Feng Xianxian’s tone was very flat. “If you knew that every time my grandmother goes to the bank, the bank president personally receives her, wouldn’t you go crazy?” ”

“Your grandmother is really amazing!”Bai Xiaoman was even more envious.

“At this moment, the speech on stage ended, and Mr. Yang walked down the stage. ”

“Bai Xiaoman excitedly grabbed Feng Xianxian’s wrist. “Coming, coming! Mr. Xianxian, Mr. Yang must be here to look for you, right?” ”

“Of course!”Feng Xianxian had a smile on her face.

“As Mr. Yang walked over, the other students in the venue also looked over. ”

“Feng Xianxian smiled and stood up from her chair under everyone’s gaze. “Hello, Grandpa Yang.” ”

“However, Grandpa Yang ignored Feng Xianxian. He directly walked past her and stopped in front of ye Zao. He said excitedly, “Zao Zao, it’s really you! I thought I had misjudged you!” ”
