“”Get up, get up, Zhao Pingting, you big lazy bum.”An Lizi directly lifted the quilt on Zhao Pingting’s body. ”

The two of them dawdled until eight o’clock before they went downstairs to eat breakfast.

Breakfast was buffet.

The food was very rich.

There was even ye Zhuo’s favorite dessert.

“After breakfast, the three of them set off for the assessment competition venue. ”

At the assessment competition venue.

Although it was only nine o’clock.

Almost all of the thirty examinees had arrived.

Except for Ye Zao.

The examination venue was very big.

It was similar to a large conference hall.

In the middle were the examinees’seats.

Around them were the invigilators and spectators’seats.

Looking at ye Zao’s empty seat.

Everyone was discussing animatedly.

“Do you guys think that ye Zao doesn’t dare to come?”

“”Do you guys even need to say that? He must have chickened out at the last minute! Which one of us who is participating in the assessment competition isn’t blessed by the heavens? Just her, can she compare to us?” ”

“Hearing this, the corners of Feng Xianxian’s mouth curved into a proud smile. ”

Old Lady Lin was also sitting in the audience seats.

Everyone around her was also discussing ye Zao.

“After all, Ye Zao was Master Yu’s personal last disciple. ”

“It was already 9:20 am. The assessment competition was about to start, but ye Zao still did not show up. Everyone was naturally curious. ”

Old Lady Lin frowned slightly.

Embarrassing!

It was really too embarrassing!

“Fortunately, no one here knew that she was ye Zao’s grandmother. ”

“Otherwise, where would she put her old face? ”

“Old Lady Lin clasped her hands together and said, “Amitabha. Bodhisattva, please bless Feng Xianxian and make sure she gets first place.”. ”

“Then, she could slap master Yu in the face. ”

“”Old sister-in-law.”At this moment, master Yu suddenly walked over. ”

Old Lady Lin stood up and nodded.

“Master Yu continued, “Old sister-in-law, I really didn’t expect you to come today! Are you also here to cheer for Zao Zao?”Master Yu originally thought that Old Lady Lin didn’t like ye Zao. ”

Now it seemed that it was all a misunderstanding.

“If Old Lady Lin didn’t like Ye Zao, would she come to participate in today’s assessment? ”

“Hearing this, the smile on Old Lady Lin’s face faded a little. “I’m here to cheer for Xianxian.” ”

Xianxian?

Feng Xianxian?

“Before master Yu could react, old lady lin continued, “Let’s make a bet.” ”

“What Bet?”Master Yu asked.

“Old Lady Lin continued, “Let’s bet on who will win first place.” ”

“Master Yu nodded. “Sure, I’ll bet on burning.” ”

“Old Lady Lin smiled and said, “Then I’ll bet on Xianxian. If Xianxian wins first place, you’ll be crying about taking Xianxian in as your disciple. You Won’t have the chance.” ”

“Feng Xianxian was talented and intelligent. If she didn’t win first place, who would win first place? ”

Ye Zao?

Ye Zao didn’t even dare to participate in the competition. He had almost embarrassed the Lin family.

She could still get first place? Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

It was simply a fantasy.

“Master Yu also laughed. “Old sister-in-law, you! You’re really muddle-headed!” ”

“Old Lady Lin snorted. “Even if I’m muddle-headed, I’m still better than you! I mistook the Fish’s eye for a Pearl!”Feng Xianxian was so good that he couldn’t see it, but he chose ye Zao who wasn’t as good as Feng Xianxian. ”

“Just you wait, you’ll make a fool of yourself soon! ”

Master Yu shook his head.

9:25 pm.

The competition was about to begin.

Ye Zhuo still didn’t show up.

“This time, the crowd’s discussion became even louder. ”

“Wang Zhishu and Sun Openg seemed to have already expected this situation, “I didn’t expect Miss Ye to be so tactful. She knew that she would lose face in the assessment competition today, so she simply didn’t even come. That’s good too! “If she doesn’t come, we can still find an excuse to block her way so that master Yu won’t lose face too!” ”

Zheng Zikai frowned. “I don’t think Miss Ye is the kind of person who would run away at the last minute. She must have encountered something.”

Wang Zhishu sneered. He felt that Zheng Zikai was possessed.

“Sun Openg looked at Zheng Zikai. “Brother, why have you become a person who looks at faces?”From Sun Openg’s point of view, Zheng Zikai trusted ye Zao so much because ye Zao was good-looking. ”

Zheng Zikai did not explain. He only looked at the entrance with a determined gaze.

9:28 pm.

There were only two minutes left before the papers were released.

Han Zhen looked at the entrance. The huge rock hanging in his heart was finally put down.

Ye Zao not participating in the assessment was the best result.

“Seeing that it was almost 9:30 pm, master Yu was also a little anxious. ”

“At 9:20 pm, the examiner stood up and prepared to hand out the papers. ”

“Master Yu said, “There’s still one minute left.” ”

“Han Zhen tilted her head and looked at Master Yu. “Master Yu, Can’t you tell? Miss Ye won’t be participating in the assessment.” ”
