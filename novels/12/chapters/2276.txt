“Although Bai Jiacheng was younger than Old Master Bai, he was still no match for Old Master Bai. ”

They arrived at the door of Bai Jingshu’s room.

The maid was still standing at the door.

Bai Jiacheng kept winking at the maid.

The maid immediately stood up. “Old Master.”

“Old Master Bai snorted and turned to look at Bai Jiacheng. “Tell me, what’s Going On?” ”

“Bai jiasheng pretended not to understand. “What do you mean, what’s going on?” ”

“Why are you sending people here to keep watch? Could it be that some criminals are locked up in Jingshu’s room?”Grandfather Bai asked.

“”No.”Bai jiasheng wiped the cold sweat off his forehead. “Dad, What are you thinking about? !” ”

“You should ask yourself what you’ve Done!”Grandfather Bai shouted angrily. “Open the door for me!”

“Bai jiasheng continued, “The door was broken a few days ago, so I can’t open it for the time being! Dad, Jingshu is really not inside. Please believe me!” ”

“”Okay, you won’t open it, right?”Elder Bai nodded. “I’ll open it myself!” ”

“Dad!”Bai Jiasheng had no choice but to hug elder Bai’s arm.

“Inside, Bai Jingshu felt as if she had heard her grandfather’s voice. ”

“However, she couldn’t hear him clearly. ”

It was as if she was hallucinating.

“Bai Jingshu looked in the direction of the door, her eyes filled with longing. ”

How she longed for her grandfather to descend from the sky and bring her out.

“Outside, Old Master Bai rolled up his sleeves and prepared to forcefully break down the door. ”

“Bai Jiacheng was very anxious. “Dad, calm down. There’s really nothing inside! If You Miss Jingshu, I can bring you to Earth to find her.” ”

“Get the hell out of my way!”Old Master Bai Flung Bai Jiacheng away. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Zhou Ying was also very anxious.

Old Master Bai walked to the door and began to open it violently.

Only when she heard the sound of the door being kicked open did Bai Jingshu dare to believe that her grandfather had really come.

Her grandfather had come to save her.

That’s great!

“Grandfather!”Bai Jingshu regained some of her strength after taking the nutrition pills and shouted with all her might.

“Hearing the voice inside, grandfather Bai’s eyes turned red. He turned to Bai Jiacheng and said, “Didn’t you say that there was no one inside? Then whose voice is that? !” ”

Bai Jiacheng didn’t know how to answer.

“”You unfilial thing, are you even human? !”Grandfather Bai raised his foot and kicked at Bai Jiacheng. ”

Bai Jiacheng was caught off guard and was directly kicked to the ground by grandfather Bai.

“Zhou Ying immediately knelt down and stood in front of Old Master Bai, “Dad! Aren’t we out of options as well? Do you know how much trouble that wretched girl has caused? We’re doing this for her own good! Everyone says that we pity the world’s parents. would our biological parents harm her?” ”

“Then tell me what happened!”Old Master Bai said.

“Bai jingfei only told Old Master Bai about Bai Jingshu being locked up. She didn’t know what happened, but he wanted to see what the couple would say. ”

“Zhou Ying continued, “This girl offended the second young master of the Chen family, Chen Yaosheng, and even locked her up in the detention center...” ”

“After hearing that, Old Master Bai was so angry that his whole body was trembling. ”

He really couldn’t imagine what kind of grievances Bai Jingshu had suffered these past few days.

“”You two B * stards! You are simply not fit to be parents!”Old Master Bai was furious, “The one who is suffering now is Jingshu. She was almost bullied! As her parents, it’s fine if you don’t stand up for her, but you even locked her up to make her compromise! Are you still human?” ”

Master Bai hated himself for not knowing about this earlier and causing Bai Jingshu to be bullied.

Bai Jiacheng and Zhou Ying were worse than animals!

“”Do you think we want to lock her up? What kind of family is the Chen Family? “Master Chen personally came to apologize and even said that he wanted to marry Jingshu. From now on, Jingshu will be the second young mistress of the Chen Family!”Zhou Ying Cried. “If we didn’t want Jingshu to marry better, we wouldn’t have to do this!” ”

“Master Bai was really angry. The couple was clearly trying to squeeze Bai Jingshu, but they had to act like they were doing Bai Jingshu a favor! ”

“”Shut up!”Master Bai continued, “Do you think I don’t Know What You’re Thinking? “Let me tell you two, if there’s nothing serious with Jingshu today, it’s fine. But if she’s missing a hair, I’ll make you pay!” ”

“After saying this, Old Master Bai exerted force with his hand and kicked open the door. ”

It was as if a beam of light had suddenly shone into the dark and boundless space.
