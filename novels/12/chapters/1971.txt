“There’s nothing bad about it.”Mother he grabbed Xu Yao’s wrist. “It’s settled then! We’ll be more at ease if you stay with us.”

He ziteng was not around. They would only be at ease if Xu Yao stayed with them.

“Mother he insisted that she stay with the he family, so Xu Yao could only ‘reluctantly’agree. ”

“Half an hour later, Xu Yao and the He family’s parents moved into the he family’s manor. ”

“Mother he brought Xu Yao to He Ziteng’s room, “Yaoyao, you can stay in Ziteng’s room. If there’s anything you’re not used to, remember to tell your uncle and me. Don’t make yourself feel wronged. Just treat this place as your own home.” ”

“”Okay, I understand, Auntie.”Xu Yao nodded. “Don’t worry, I’ll definitely treat this place as my own home.” ”

“Good child.”

“After staying in the hospital for more than ten days, father he went back to his busy work. ” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Although he ziteng was in trouble, his life still had to go on. ”

Mother he was also a little busy.

“Hence, Xu Yao was the only one left in this huge manor. ”

“Xu Yao was lonely, so she invited Mi Chen over. ”

“In the midst of intense love, Mi Chen hugged Xu Yao and fell onto he ziteng’s bed. ”

“Xu Yao frowned slightly and asked worriedly, “Child, Will the Child Be Alright?” ”

Mi Chen blew into her ear. “I’m a doctor. I know what I’m doing. Don’t worry.”

“Okay.”Xu Yao nodded slightly.

“About half an hour later, Xu Yao lay in Mi Chen’s arms with a red face. “Do you think he ziteng is really dead? I Had a dream last night and he came back to life in the dream. It really scared me to death!” ”

“”Silly, dreams are reversed.”Mi Chen hugged Xu Yao tightly. “Don’t worry. Even if he ziteng isn’t dead now, he won’t be able to live! Next, it will be the two old guys’Turn!” ”

“Speaking up to this point, Mi Chen’s eyes flashed with a vicious light. ”

“Xu Yao continued, “Have you dealt with He ziteng’s car accident?”Xu Yao didn’t want anything to happen when her life was really sweet. ”

“”Don’t worry, baby.”Mi Chen lowered her head and kissed Xu Yao. “From now on, the He family will be ours.” ”

The corners of Xu Yao’s mouth curled up.

“At this moment, there was a sound from downstairs. ”

“From the sound, it seemed that the he family’s parents had returned. ”

“Xu Yao immediately sat up from the bed. “The old thing is back! Quick, quickly put on your clothes!” ”

Mi Chen was also quite frightened. She immediately found some clothes to put on.

“If the He family’s parents found out about their affair at this time, then all of their efforts would be wasted! ”

“After putting on her clothes, Xu Yao opened the window to let the air in. She turned around and looked at Mi Chen. “Come down with me later. Tell them that I’m not feeling well, so you came over to see me.” ”

“Okay.”Mi Chen nodded.

Xu Yao adjusted her expression and went downstairs.

“Downstairs, the He family’s parents had returned. ”

“Xu Yao smiled and said, “Uncle, Auntie, you’re back.” ”

“Mi Chen followed behind and called for them. “Uncle, Auntie.” ”

“Doctor Mi is here too!”Mother he said with a smile.

“Xu Yao nodded and said, “I’m not feeling well. I was afraid that you’d be worried, so I didn’t go to the hospital. Let doctor mi come over to see me.” ”

“When they heard that Xu Yao was feeling unwell, the he family’s parents immediately became nervous. “Yaoyao, are you alright? Where are you feeling unwell?” ”

“”Uncle, Auntie, don’t worry,”Mi Chen said at this moment. “It’s not a big problem. Just rest and rest more.” ”

“”That’s good.”The he family’s parents heaved a sigh of relief and continued, “Doctor Mi, you and our family’s ziteng have always been good friends. If you have time, you can come and accompany Yaoyao more often.” ”

“”Okay.”Mi chen nodded and continued, “Xu Yao’s foundation isn’t good to begin with. In addition, Ziteng’s condition has been affected, so his pregnancy is still a little unstable. You have to pay more attention to rest and replenish your nutrition.” ”

“Hearing this, mother he immediately nodded. “Don’t worry, doctor Mi. I know.”In the past few days, she had instructed the servants to make bird’s nest for Xu Yao every day. ”

“However, Xu Yao’s appetite was too small. She could only eat a small bowl at a time. ”

“”I still have some matters to attend to, so I’ll be leaving first. Goodbye, uncle and Auntie,”Mi Chen said gently. ”

“”Take care, doctor mi.”The He family’s parents sent doctor mi out of the door. ”

“After Mi Chen left, mother he sighed. “This doctor mi is really a good person.” ”

Xu Yao’s lips curled up slightly.

“In the blink of an eye, a week had passed. ”

Today was the day of the results.

“Ever since midnight, the He family’s parents had entered a period of insomnia. No matter how hard they tried, they could not fall asleep. They were looking forward to ye Zhuo’s call. ”
