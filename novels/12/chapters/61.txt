Chapter 62: Could They Be the Same Person?

She had saved the teapot and put it on the table in less than 20 seconds. It seemed to be a short moment, but only Cen Shaoqing, a martial artist, knew how difficult it was.

And the teapot was filled with boiling hot tea. Not only did she not burn herself, but she did not let a single drop of the tea spill out. The entire process was as smooth as flowing clouds and flowing water.

How could a person without any real martial arts background be able to do it?

“Thank you.” Ye Zhuo lowered his eyes slightly and met Cen Shaoqing’s eyes. Their eyes met. In a flash, there seemed to be ripples in all directions, but they soon disappeared.

Ye Zhuo had a good memory.

Seeing these eyes, she quickly remembered the man she saw at the Mu family banquet that night.

Then, she thought of Mu Yourong’s words and actions just now. She suddenly realized that Mu Yourong was probably acting for him. This man was obviously a favored son of heaven with an extraordinary background. It seemed Mu Yourong harbored quite big ambitions.

Cen Shaoqing was stunned.

When he was young, he became famous after a fight. Back then. his body was tainted with an evil aura. In reCent years, due to the fact that he had converted into a Buddhist and vegetarian, although his evil aura had dissipated quite a bit, there were still very few people who could look at him for more than three seconds. The same could be said for his business partners. Usually, when they talked to him, they deliberately avoided his eyes.

Unexpectedly, Cen Shaoqing met an exception today. He was extremely surprised that the other party was only a young girl in her teens.

“Zhuo Zhuo!”

At this moment, Bai Nana suddenly ran over.

“What’s wrong?” Ye Zhuo discreetly looked away and tilted her head to look at Nana.

Bai Nana handed her phone to her. “Zhuo Zhuo, your phone is ringing!”

“Oh, thank you.” Ye Zhuo took the phone and walked to a quiet place to answer the phone.

Cen Shaoqing watched her back, as he picked up his cup and took a sip of tea. His deep eyes were as dark as ink, and his right hand caressed the bright red Buddha beads.

“Brother Fifth, don’t tell me you have fallen for Ye Zhuo?” Li Qiandong asked worriedly.

Cen Shaoqing did not speak. The warm light contrasted with the cold and hard outline, making him appear noble and mysterious.

“Brother Fifth! Ye Zhuo is playing hard to get! You must not fall for her trick!”

Li Qiandong was worried that Cen Shaoqing would fall for her trick, so he was extremely anxious.

Cen Shaoqing was the only son of the Cen family. His methods were cold and harsh, and he stood at the highest end of the pyramid. There were too many women who wanted to get their hands on him.

In Li Qiandong’s opinion, not everyone was as pure and kind as Mu Yourong. Even in the face of the proud son of the heavens like Cen Shaoqing, she did not lose her true self.

“You think too badly of Ye Zhuo. She doesn’t need to play hard to get.” Cen Shaoqing’s tone was indifferent. “Moreover, I don’t want to get married.”

If he was like other men, then Ye Zhuo would definitely be a good match!

Unfortunately.

No.

His goal in life had never been to get married and have children.

Moreover, Ye Zhuo’s goal in life was not necessarily to get married and have children.

It was a pity that she was so young. If she were slightly older, it wouldn’t be a bad idea to be good friends with her.

At this moment, Fifth Master Cen still had not reacted. He did not have a single close female friend in his life.

Li Qiandong was on the verge of tears.

Cen Shaoqing usually seemed to be a rather intelligent person, so why couldn’t he see through Ye Zhuo’s little trick?! On the other hand, Cen Shaoqing insisted that the kind Mu Yourong was acting. But Cen Shaoqing was the one who couldn’t tell apart the genuine person from the fake one.

‘Brother Fifth has been really smart all his life. I can’t believe he’s so muddle-headed over this matter!’ Li Qiandong sighed.

Soon later, the vegetarian hotpot was served.

It was a big pot, and it looked no different from other vegetarian hotpots.

Seeing this, Cen Shaoqing lost his appetite. Moreover, he wasn’t a foodie.

Li Qiandong used his chopsticks to pick up some vegetables and some unknown balls for Cen Shaoqing. “Brother Fifth, have a taste. I guarantee that the taste will definitely satisfy you.”

Seeing Li Qiandong’s excitement, Cen Shaoqing picked up his chopsticks and took a bite of the vegetables. As soon as he took a bite, his originally calm eyes lit up.

The cooked vegetables tasted very good. They were crisp and carried the fresh fragrance of mushrooms.

Cen Shaoqing tasted the ball again and took a small bite. The juice flowed in all directions and the taste lingered on his lips and teeth. It was sour and spicy, especially appetizing.

Even Cen Shaoqing, who had eaten at countless state banquets, was instantly satisfied by this taste!

No wonder Li Qiandong could not stop praising it.

“How is it? Brother Fifth, the taste is not bad, right?”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “It is indeed not bad.”

Li Qiandong knew Cen Shaoqing’s personality. It was extremely difficult for him to say that it was ‘not bad’.

During the meal, Mu Yourong paid particular attention to her image. Not only did she appear elegant and generous, but she also ate two bowls of rice.

She was afraid that if she ate too little, Cen Shaoqing would think that she was being too pretentious.

After all, there were many young ladies who only ate a little bit at a time in order to lose weight.

She wanted to let Cen Shaoqing know that not only was she a vegetarian, she was also different from the rest!

Unfortunately, Cen Shaoqing did not even look at her from the beginning to the end. Instead, it was Li Qiandong who kept saying ‘Miss Mu is an extraordinary person’.

By then, Cen Shaoqing was 80% full. He put down his chopsticks and said, “I’m going back first.”

Hearing that, Li Qiandong also stood up.

Cen Shaoqing said, “You don’t have to follow me.”

Coincidentally, Li Qiandong was not full yet, so he said, “In that case, Brother Fifth, have a safe journey back.”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

When Cen Shaoqing passed by, Mu Yourong finally saw his stunning side profile.

He was beyond her reach. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Ba-dump! Ba-dump! Ba-dump!

Mu Yourong felt that her heart was no longer hers.

There was still a long way to go, but she would definitely make Fifth Master Cen bow down to her! Moreover, she wanted Fifth Master Cen to beg her to be with him!

…

After returning home at night, Ye Zhuo took a shower and went to live stream to play games.

What she was live streaming today was not the Honor of Kings, but chess.

Chess was the quintessence of China!

Whether in the past or now, Ye Zhuo liked it very much.

What surprised Ye Zhuo was that there were actually more than ten viewers in the live broadcast room today. There were even comments in the comment section.

‘F*ck! The streamer is actually a Level 7 chess player!’

Under normal circumstances, it was very difficult for a non-professional chess player to become a Level 7 chess player, especially when the player was a girl.

‘Little Missy, you didn’t find someone to play on your behalf, right?’

Ye Zhuo glanced at the comment section and found that more comments had popped up.

‘It’s only level 7. Do you think she needs others to play on her behalf?’

‘F*ck! Missy’s voice is so nice.’

‘Missy, show us your face!’

Ye Zhuo said, “I don’t need to rely on my looks to make a living.”

‘Missy, don’t brag!’

Ye Zhuo replied to the bullet screen while manipulating the mouse and keyboard.

Although her tone was casual, her playing speed was not slow. Almost as soon as her opponent started playing, she caught up, as if she did not need to think.

Her slender jade-like fingertips met the cold and hard black keyboard, forming an extremely beautiful scene. Her mind was clear.

The battle was getting more and more intense. Both sides seemed to be in a stalemate, chasing each other step by step, neither letting the other go. It was very obvious that the other party was also an expert!

‘Live streamer, you can do it! Play cautiously and don’t underestimate your opponent!’

However, Ye Zhuo’s tone was still nonchalant. “I’ll let him have another piece, then I will defeat him within three steps!”

‘Live streamer, it seems like the one who’s going to be defeated is you!’

‘The streamer is bragging!’

“I’m not bragging!”

At this moment, the game ended and the screen displayed, [Checkmate! Black wins!]

Ye Zhuo was playing Black.

‘F*ck! This streamer is f*cking amazing!’

‘That move was really amazing!!!’

[Account notification: Heaven-toppling earth-crushing Purple-gold Hammer 1225 gifted a sports car!]

[Account notification: Ah Lei gifted a cloud piercing arrow!]

[Account notification: Chao Hui 1985…]

Ye Zhuo played a total of two games, and the number of viewers in the live broadcast room increased from single digits to three digits.

Although there were only over 300 viewers, Ye Zhuo used her superb chess skills to gain over 200 fans and a profit of 300 yuan.

‘Streamer, play one more game!’

Ye Zhuo looked at the time. “I’m not playing anymore. It’s time to sleep. You guys should sleep early too.”

After saying this, Ye Zhuo turned off the live broadcast.

…

Meanwhile, on the other side.

[Defeated! Black wins!]

Seeing this line of words on the computer screen, Cen Shaoqing frowned and picked up the lighter beside him.

Pa!

A ball of faint blue flames rose in the air. His originally cold face was now pursed tightly. Under the light of the blue flames, he appeared even more reserved and cold.

Other than chanting sutras and chanting Buddhas, his biggest hobby was chess. Whether it was in his life or on the Internet, he had never met a worthy opponent. Today was the first time someone had defeated him.

Moreover, the other party had beaten him twice in a row.

Cen Shaoqing was used to strategizing. He was used to everything being controlled in his hands. Suddenly losing to a stranger and meeting a worthy opponent made it difficult for him to remain calm.

Cen Shaoqing lit a cigarette. He held the Buddha beads in one hand and the mouse in the other as he clicked on the opponent’s information.

In-Game Name: Hitara.YZ.

Inexplicably, Cen Shaoqing thought of Niohuru.YZ.

Could they be the same person?
