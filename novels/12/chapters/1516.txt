An Lizi scratched her face. “I don’t seem to have any outstanding young men around me who are particularly suitable for you!”

“”I’m not picky, as long as my family background is passable!”Zhang Qingqing continued, “Lizi, we grew up together, don’t tell me you’re not willing to help me with such a small favor?””

“An Lizi said with a troubled expression, “It’s not that I’m not willing to help, it’s that I really don’t have one! If there is one, how can I not introduce it to you? Most of the people I know already have girlfriends! or they’re just not suitable for you!””

“How are they not suitable for you?”Zhang Qingqing asked back.

“An Lizi said, “I know one, and he can change four or five girlfriends a week. Can you accept that?””

“”Of course!”Zhang Qingqing said, “If you introduce me to him, what if I’m the One? You didn’t even introduce me, and you already know that we’re not suitable? Lizi, aren’t you underestimating me too much?””

“An Lizi said, “Do you know who his last girlfriend was?””

“Who?”Zhang Qingqing asked.

“An lizi continued, “Nancy.””

“”Nancy?”Zhang Qingqing covered her mouth and said, “International supermodel Nancy?””

“DAMN!”Zhang Qingqing was very surprised.

“As an international supermodel, not only was Nancy good-looking, but her figure was also excellent.”

“After saying that, Zhang Qingqing continued, “No wonder for a period of time, Nancy’s resources were super good, and she even appeared on variety shows! Is it because of your friend?””

“Yes.”An Lizi nodded.

“”Awesome!”Zhang Qingqing continued, “Apart from that? Don’t you have any other friends?””

“”There’s another one,”an lizi continued, “But he has some special hobbies. Previously, he directly sent his girlfriend to the hospital!””

“Why?”Zhang Qingqing asked curiously.

An Lizi found it difficult to say it out loud. She leaned over to Zhang Qingqing’s ear and whispered.

“Hearing this, Zhang Qingqing frowned and said, “Eh, it’s disgusting! This won’t do either. Is there anything else?””

An Lizi shook her head. “The others already have girlfriends!”

“Hearing this, Zhang Qingqing was a little disappointed. She continued, “Then help me keep an eye out. If you meet a single person, you must introduce them to me!””

“Sure.”An Lizi nodded.

“As the two of them walked and talked, they passed by a hot pot restaurant. Zhang Qingqing said, “It’s so cold today. Let’s Go Eat Hot Pot!””

“Okay!”An Lizi nodded.

The two of them walked into the hot pot restaurant and chose a seat by the window.

“This was a relatively high-end hot pot restaurant, so there were not many people eating there.”

“After the two of them sat down, another group of people was brought in by the shop assistant.”

“”Brother Ze, that move you just made was amazing!””

“”Brother Ze, when are you going to bring our sister out to eat together?””

“My sister already has a boyfriend.”

“”If she has a boyfriend, then she has a boyfriend! If she has a boyfriend, then she can’t socialize? Her boyfriend is in charge of the world, so how can he make friends with our sister?””

“That’s right! That’s right!”Fat Tiger and dog two hurriedly nodded.

They didn’t have any other intentions. They just wanted to make friends with their sister. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Could it be that having a boyfriend didn’t even give them this little bit of freedom?

Lin Ze raised his head and looked at Li Wen. “My Sister’s boyfriend is Master Five.”

Master Five?

“Li Wen was stunned for a moment before he continued, “Master Five Cen?””

“Yes.”Lin Ze nodded.

“When he said that, the air went silent for a moment.”

“After a moment, Li Wen raised his head and said very seriously, “Brother Ze, I think you’re right. Since our sister already has a boyfriend, it’s better for her not to get involved with us men!””

Dog two nodded in agreement. “I think so too.”

Fat Tiger nodded as well. “I think so too!”

The waiter brought the group of people to a booth and sat down.

“Li Wen, fat tiger, and dog two took out their tablets and ordered dishes.”

“”Brother Ze, do you want to eat shrimp slip?””

Lin Ze nodded. “Yes.”

“At this moment, Lin Ze suddenly saw a familiar figure in the shop and said, “You guys order. I saw my cousin, so I went over to say hello.””

“You go ahead!”

Lin Ze picked up his phone and walked over to say hello.

“Sister Lizi.”

“An Lizi was chatting with Zhang Qingqing when she suddenly heard a familiar voice. She looked up and saw a youth wearing a black hoodie. “Ah Ze, you’re eating hotpot here too?””

“Lin Ze nodded. “I came with my friends. Sister Lizi, are you alone?””

“”My friend went to the bathroom,”anlize said.”
