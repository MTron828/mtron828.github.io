“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Actually, I was just being polite with you.” ”

“This girl!”Lin Jincheng chuckled.

“Ye Zao went upstairs and tasted the durian layer cake. He found that the taste was not right. Then, he tasted the mango pancake. Then, he took out his phone and sent a message to CEN Shaoqing. After editing a paragraph, Ye Zao deleted it again, cen Shaoqing must still be on the way. He would send it when he got home. ”

“Fifteen minutes later, Ye Zao sent a message to CEN Shaoqing. [ are you home yet? ] ”

“[ yes, I’m soaking my feet. ] Cen Shaoqing sent a picture of him soaking his feet to ye Zao. ”

“Ever since he got a girlfriend, Cen Shaoqing was used to taking a photo of what he was doing and sending it to the other party. ”

He understood all the actions of those couples that he did not understand in the past. He even enjoyed it.

“Ye Zhuo also took a photo for him. [ these two desserts were not bought. You made them yourself, right? ] ”

Cen Shaoqing was stunned. [ did you taste it? ]

[ yes. ]

Cen Shaoqing continued to reply: [ as expected of a biological girlfriend. ]

Ye Zao sent an emoji.

...

Time passed quickly.

“In the blink of an eye, the lantern festival had passed. On the day that Baizhi and Liu de left the Cen family, Ye Zao and some of the Cen family’s older sisters had gone to the airport to send them off. ”

The rest of their lives became busier again.

Ye Zao was busy running between the school and the base.

“She was already a junior this year. Unlike other departments, the chemistry department had to participate in various experiments during her junior year. ”

Ye Zhuo had just finished an experiment when he received a call from Tang Mi. She said that there was a problem with the laboratory.

“”Alright, I’ll be there right away.” ”

Ye Zhuo hung up the phone and sat in the driver’s seat. He then drove towards the base.

“Half an hour later, the car arrived at the base. ”

“Tang Mi was standing at the door. When she saw ye Zhuo walking over, she immediately went up to him. “Miss Ye!” ”

Ye Zao nodded slightly. “What went wrong?”

“Tang mi continued, “Didn’t you propose to use a nuclear reactor as the power raw material? “But when we did the experiment today, we found that the nuclear reactor didn’t react at all with the protons! “Miss Ye, do you think there’s a problem with the calculation formula?” ”

“At present, the production of the aircraft carrier was already half completed. If there was a problem with the power raw materials at this time, then all the efforts that they had put in for so long would be in vain! ”

“”It shouldn’t be a problem with the formula.”Ye Zhuo continued, “Don’t worry, let’s go in and take a look first.” ”

“Okay.”Tang mi nodded and followed ye Zhuo’s footsteps.

“Although it was only half an hour, the news of a problem with the power raw materials had already spread throughout the base. ”

“The aircraft carrier plan was already in doubt. Now that the power raw materials had gone wrong again, the entire construction cabin was in an uproar. ”

Everyone was discussing whether the aircraft carrier plan was going to be declared a failure!

“After all, the power raw materials were the heart of the aircraft carrier. ”

“If the aircraft carrier wanted to reach the speed of light, it had to use the nuclear reactor as the power raw materials. ”

“And the nuclear reactor had gone wrong again and again. From the looks of it, this aircraft carrier plan was most likely going to end in failure! ”

“Cen Jiang appeared among the crowd and said with a smile, “Don’t worry, everyone. Miss Ye hasn’t arrived yet! I believe that Miss Ye will definitely have a way to solve it.” ”

Cen Jiang’s appearance successfully reduced the noise of the crowd’s discussion. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Although the aircraft carrier plan had not been completed, they had witnessed ye Zhuo’s ability. Perhaps ye Zhuo really had a way to solve it. ”

“”Team leader Cen, have the leaders informed Miss Ye?” ”

“Cen Jiang said, “Don’t worry, everyone. We’ve already informed her.” ”

On the other side.

In Tang Xue’s office.

Tang Xue listened to her assistant’s report and smiled as she looked up. “Really? What’s the problem this time?”

“Although the aircraft carrier project had always been a fantasy, and Tang Xue had long been used to having problems from time to time, every time she heard that something had happened in Area C, she could not help but be excited. ”

She was very much looking forward to the arrival of the three-year agreement soon.

“More than a year had passed, and now there were less than two years left. ”

“The assistant continued, “I heard that it’s the nuclear reaction and the proton problem!” ”

“Hearing this, Tang Xue narrowed her eyes. “Did ye Zao previously claim that he could combine the nuclear reaction and the proton as power materials to create an aircraft carrier that was faster than the speed of light?” ”

“”Yes.”The assistant nodded. “Now that there is a problem with the power materials, the people in Area C are worried that the aircraft carrier will not be completed as promised.” ”
