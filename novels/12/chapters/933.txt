“My Grandmother said that you love the Cen family’s fourth miss and not Cen Yuyan. I just wanted to prove to them that you love me as a person! I didn’t expect you to actually scold me!”

“The more Cen Yuyan thought about it, the more uncomfortable she felt.”

Zhou Rui also came to a realization at this moment.

Yes.

How could he blame Cen Yuyan.

Cen Yuyan was his money tree and his hope for the rest of his life. He couldn’t blame Cen Yuyan.

“Since the Cen family didn’t believe him, then he had to prove to the CEN family that he wasn’t the kind of unreliable person.”

“After all, Cen Yuyan was the Cen family’s fourth young miss. The blood of the CEN family flowed in her body.”

Could it be that the CEN family could really let Cen Yuyan go?

Definitely Not!

“”Yuyan, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to be fierce to you.”Zhou Rui turned to look at Cen Yuyan, he continued, “I just feel that it’s not worth it for you to fall out with your family for me. After all, they are your family. They will definitely feel terrible if you do this.””

“”But I feel that it’s very worth it.”Cen Yuyan looked at Zhou Rui and said very seriously, “Zhou Rui, you’re my boyfriend. I’m willing to give up everything for you!””

Even my life!

“Zhou Rui was moved as he hugged Cen Yuyan. “Thank you, Yuyan.””

“Cen Yuyan sniffed and continued, “Zhou Rui, now my grandmother and my mother don’t want me anymore. Do you still want me?””

“”Yes, of course!”Zhou Rui hugged Cen Yuyan tightly. “Yuyan, in a while, I’ll earn money to support you! You’ll be responsible for being as beautiful as a flower, and I’ll be responsible for earning money to support the family!””

“Really?”Cen Yuyan was very touched.

“Zhou rui smiled and said, “Of course it’s true. You’re my girlfriend, my future wife, and also the future mother of my child. If I don’t support you, who will?””

“Cen Yuyan was even more touched. This was the most beautiful words of love she had ever heard in her life. Cen Yuyan directly kissed Zhou Rui’s lips. “Zhou Rui, thank you.”.”

“Although she could no longer be the Cen family’s princess, she could still be Zhou Rui’s princess.”

Cen Yuyan knew that Zhou Rui would not let her down.

Because Zhou Rui was not that kind of person!

The two of them lingered for a long time before letting go of each other.

“Zhou Rui said, “Then from now on, you just need to stay at home and be as beautiful as a flower.””

“Okay.”Cen Yuyan nodded.

The car soon stopped at the place where Zhou Rui was staying.

“Zhou Rui personally got out of the car and opened the door for Cen Yuyan. “Yuyan, we’re home.””

“Although this neighborhood was also a wealthy neighborhood, it couldn’t be compared to the neighborhood where Cen Yuyan used to live.”

“However, Cen Yuyan believed that with Zhou Rui’s ability, sooner or later, they would live in a more upscale neighborhood.”

Their good days had just begun.

The two of them entered the house together.

“Cen Yuyan had lived here twice before, so there was still Cen Yuyan’s change of clothes in the house.”

“Zhou Rui said, “Go in and take a shower first. I’ll get you some clothes. Oh right, what do you want to Eat Tonight?””

“Cen Yuyan smiled and said, “Anything Is Fine. The important thing is who you eat with.””

“Zhou Rui pushed Cen Yuyan into the bathroom. “Alright, go take a shower. I’ll order takeout.””

“Okay.”

“Although Cen Yuyan said that anything was fine, Zhou Rui still very considerately ordered a bunch of dishes that Cen Yuyan liked to eat.”

Cen Yuyan was already very touched.

“At this moment, she was even more touched.”

“The more she thought about it, the more she felt that she was right about the person.”

Zhou Rui was the man she wanted to spend the rest of her life with.

“After dinner, Zhou Rui found an excuse to go out.”

He had to ask song Chenyu for money.

“Cen Yuyan was now penniless, and he had no source of income. The two of them couldn’t just sit at home and eat their fill. “I want ten million.””

Zhou Rui opened his mouth and asked for ten million.

“Ten million?”Song Chenyu’s voice came from the other end of the screen. “Do you think I’m Cen Yuyan?” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“”Now that the CEN family has cut off all of CEN Yuyan’s financial resources, what do you want me to do?””

Song Chenyu narrowed his eyes. “I only have one million. I’ll transfer it to your card in a while. You guys should spend it sparingly during this period of time.”

“Only one million?”Zhou Rui frowned.

“Song Chenyu continued, “Now is not the time to worry about one million or two million. You have to quickly get Cen Yuyan pregnant. Only when Cen Yuyan is pregnant can you officially become the CEN family’s son-in-law!”! When the rice is cooked, they can’t deny it even if they want to!””

Zhou Rui also wanted to get Cen Yuyan pregnant.

Even in his dreams.

“However, he had tried so many times, but Cen Yuyan had never been able to get pregnant.”
