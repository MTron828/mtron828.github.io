“Her skin is even thicker than the city wall!”

“”Why doesn’t she look at herself in the mirror and see what kind of person she is! For someone like her, Jin Ruyu probably wouldn’t even look at her.” ”

“”If I didn’t see it with my own eyes, I would never believe that there is such a shameless person in this world.” ”

Everyone’s mocking laughter filled his ears.

“These words were like knives, cutting Zhao Xueyin’s face one by one. It made Zhao Xueyin almost lose her balance, and her back was covered in layers of cold sweat. ”

“Unwillingness, humiliation, and all sorts of emotions were mixed together. ”

Ming Yao turned to look at the butler beside her. “Butler Wang.”

“I’m here.”

“Ming Yao continued, “Invite this mentally abnormal lady out. Those who are here to celebrate Grandma’s birthday are all distinguished guests. If this mentally abnormal lady hurts someone, it won’t be good!” ”

“Okay.”The Butler nodded and immediately gave the bodyguard a look.

Two strong men walked over.

“”Xueyin, let’s Go...”Wen si lan pulled Zhao Xueyin and walked out. ”

It was better to leave by herself than to be chased away by the security guards!

“Just like that, Zhao Xueyin was pulled out by Wen Si Lan. ”

“”Xueyin, shall I send you back now?”Based on Zhao Xueyin’s current condition, Wen Si Lan would definitely be worried if she were to drive back alone. ”

“”No, I’m not going back!” ”

She wanted to wait for the lawyer.

She did not believe that the lawyer would be so heartless.

The book said that falling in love with someone only took a minute.

Forgetting someone would take a lifetime.

“The lawyer loved her to the bone, so how could he forget her so quickly. ”

The lawyer did this to make her jealous.

It had to be like this.

“As long as Si lui was willing to apologize now, she could marry Si lui immediately. ”

She didn’t care about the past.

“”Xueyin...”Wen si lan continued, “Do you really know Jin Ruyu?” ”

“I’m his favorite person. He even proposed to me!”Zhao Xueyin said.

“Wen Si lan asked doubtfully, “Are you sure?”She suspected that there was something wrong with Zhao Xueyin’s mental state. ”

“Otherwise, she wouldn’t have said such ridiculous things. ”

“Zhao Xueyin had been developing in the country all these years, and Jin Ruyu had only returned recently. ”

How could such two people have any interactions?

And they even proposed to each other

“Moreover, Jin Ruyu had already made it clear that he didn’t know Zhao Xueyin. ”

“Zhao Xueyin held Wen Si Lan’s hand tightly. “Si Lan, trust me! Trust me! The person si likes is really me! He’s doing this now just to make me jealous!” ”

“Wen Si Lan’s expression was a little complicated. “Xueyin, I’d better send you back first.” ”

“I’m not going back. I want to wait for him here.”Si Lui loved her.

Si lui only had her in his heart!

Ming Yao was nothing.

What right did Ming Yao have to compete with her.

Wen Si Lan sighed.

In the banquet hall.

Ming Yao held her wine and looked at Si lui with a smile. “You really don’t know Zhao Xueyin?”

“Si Lu didn’t deny it and continued, “It’s a long story. Now that I think about it, the only thing I have left from that memory is disgust.” ”

It was very disgusting.

“Can you tell me about it?”Ming Yao asked.

“Sure.”Si Lu nodded.

“When Zhao Xueyin was mentioned again, Si Lu was very calm. ”

“After listening to the whole process, Ming Yao frowned. “I didn’t expect that there would be such a story between the two of you.” ”

She didn’t expect that the beautiful Zhao Xueyin would be so disgusting.

No wonder si lui was so heartless.

“An hour later, the banquet ended. ”

Zhao Xueyin stood at the door and watched as everyone walked out one after another.

Zhao Xueyin didn’t care at all as everyone pointed at her.

Once si lui admitted her in front of everyone.

“At that time, they would be the ones who would feel the pain! ”

“At this moment, Zhao Xueyin finally saw a familiar figure and immediately rushed over, “Big Brother Si!” ”

“Si lui lowered his head to look at Zhao Xueyin, his eyes filled with disgust. ”

“”Big Brother Si, I’m Xueyin! You said that you loved me the most! Didn’t you propose to me before? Now I agree to you!” ”

“Urgh!”

“Looking at such a face, Si Lui’s stomach churned. He couldn’t control himself and directly vomited on Zhao Xue Yin’s face. ”

The sour and stinky smell that belonged to the digestive products assaulted his face.

Zhao Xue Yin was immediately stunned.

The people at the side were also shocked.

No one had expected that Zhao Xue Yin would directly vomit si lui.

“Si lui took the napkin that his assistant handed over and wiped his mouth. “Miss Zhao, a person should know their place. I hope that you won’t do such a disgusting thing next time.” ”

“After saying that, the lawyer turned around and left. ”

Zhao Xueyin looked at the cold and emotionless back of the lawyer and burst into tears. She was so desperate that her entire body was trembling.

“However, the moment she opened her mouth, the vomit flowed down the corners of her mouth. ”

Zhao Xueyin could only shut her mouth and cry in a muffled voice.

She regretted it.

She really regretted it.

“If she had known that the lawyer was Jin Ruyu, she definitely would not have been so heartless that day. ”

This kind of feeling of losing a watermelon after picking up a sesame seed was really too unbearable.

The onlookers just covered their mouths and looked at Zhao Xueyin as if they were watching a good show. There were even flashing lights.

“Ah!”Zhao Xueyin suddenly stood up and pushed aside the crowd to run to the side.

“By the time Zhao Xueyin returned to the Zhao residence, it was already late at night. ”

“Although it was already past eleven o’clock, Father Zhao was still awake. He still sat in the living room and waited for her. “Have you seen Jin Ruyu?” ”

Jin Ruyu. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“When she heard these three words, Zhao Xueyin’s heart felt like it was being cut by a knife. ”

“Speak! Are You Mute?”Father Zhao looked at Zhao Xueyin.

Zhao Xueyin nodded. “I have.”

“Father Zhao continued, “How is it?” ”

“I don’t know! I don’t know!”Zhao Xueyin covered her ears with both hands and quickly ran upstairs.

“Seeing her like this, Father Zhao narrowed his eyes and turned to look at his assistant. “Go and find out what happened at Old Lady Ming’s Birthday Banquet Tonight.” ”

“Okay.”The assistant nodded.

“As soon as the assistant left, Butler Old Zhang walked in from outside. “Master.” ”

“What’s the matter?”Father Zhao asked.

“The Butler looked around and confirmed that Zhao Xueyin wasn’t around. Then, he lowered his voice and said, “Master, there’s news about young master!” ”

“Really?”Father Zhao’s eyes lit up.

“Although he missed every time, every time he heard that there was news about Zhao Ziye, Father Zhao couldn’t help but be excited. ”

“After all, it was better to have news than to have no news. ”

“”It’s true.”The Butler hurriedly nodded and continued, “This time it must be true!” ”

“Where is Ziye?”Father Zhao immediately asked.

“The butler said, “Young master just moved here from the Yun Capital and is now in the capital. His surname is Ye.” ”
