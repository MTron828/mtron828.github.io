Chapter 1339: 277: Xie Wanqiu’s secret. Stupid to the extreme

Translator: 549690339

“”It’s been checked. There’s nothing wrong,”Ye Sen said. ”

“That’s good.”

Zheng Wanyin was stunned when she heard this.

Wasn’t Cen Shaoqing here to visit Xie Wanqiu?

So they had overestimated themselves.

“Seeing Cen Shaoqing like this, he didn’t seem to know that Xie Wanqiu was sick and was hospitalized. ”

Could it be...

Zhou Xiang did not tell him?

“Thinking of this, Zheng Wanyin quickly returned to the ward. ”

“Grandma.”

“Why are you back so soon?”Xie wanqiu put down her phone and turned the screen back on.

“Zheng wanyin said, “Grandma, Guess Who I saw outside just now?” ”

“”Who?”Xie wanqiu said, “Could it be ye Zhuo?” ”

“Other than ye Zao, Xie Wanqiu couldn’t think of anyone else. ”

“At this moment, Xie Wanqiu’s phone rang with a video call. ”

Xie wanqiu acted as if she didn’t hear it.

“Zheng wanyin reminded, “Grandma, your phone rang.” ”

“Xie wanqiu said, “Don’t worry about it. Continue.” ”

“Zheng wanyin nodded and continued, “I did see ye Zao downstairs just now. However, you were only half right.” ”

“What do you mean?”Xie wanqiu asked.

“After saying that, Xie Wanqiu’s phone continued to ring. ”

“”Grandma, aren’t you going to see who it is?”Zheng wanyin continued, “It might be something urgent.” ”

“Hearing that, Xie Wanqiu picked up her phone, but she did not press the call button. Instead, she switched to voice chat. “Hello.” ”

“It was unknown what was said on the other end, but Xie wanqiu continued, “It’s not convenient for me right now. I’ll talk to you later.” ”

“Then, she ended the call. ”

“Seeing that Xie Wanqiu had ended the call, Zheng WANQIU continued, “Other than ye Zhuo, I also saw my cousin.” ”

Cen Shaoqing?

Xie wanqiu was a little surprised. “Really? Shaoqing is here too?”

Zheng wanqiu nodded. “Really!”

Xie wanqiu was not surprised that ye Zhuo had come to apologize to her.

“After all, if ye Zhuo wanted to marry Cen Shaoqing, he had to get the approval of his grandmother. ”

“However, Cen Shaoqing had actually come along too. This was beyond her expectations. ”

Cen Shaoqing had a cold personality and rarely interfered in these matters. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

She had not expected that Cen Shaoqing would actually come along with Ye Zhuo to admit his mistake.

One could imagine how important her grandmother was in Cen Shaoqing’s heart!

“Thinking of this, Xie Wanqiu was especially excited. She continued, “Where are they now?” ”

“Zheng wanyin continued, “They’re at the hospital’s main hall.” ”

“They were already at the hospital’s main hall, which meant that they were about to arrive. ”

“Xie wanqiu hurriedly laid on the bed and instructed Zheng wanyin, “Yinyin, if your cousin arrives in a while, tell your cousin that I’ve been in a coma and haven’t woken up yet!” ”

She had to let Cen Shaoqing see how serious she was.

“Cen Shaoqing was so filial. When he saw that she was still unconscious, he would definitely dump ye Zao on the spot. ”

“When she thought of that scene, Xie Wanqiu felt very happy. ”

Who Did ye Zao think he was!

Someone like her wanted to marry Cen Shaoqing?

It was simply ridiculous.

She did not even consider her own weight.

“When she heard that, Zheng Wanyin’s expression was a little awkward. “Grandma, actually, there’s one more thing.” ”

“What is it?”Xie wanqiu asked.

“Zheng wanyin continued, “I told you not to be angry.” ”

“Xie wanqiu nodded. “Yes, I’m not angry.”Cen Shaoqing had already brought ye Zhuo over to apologize personally. What was there to be angry about? ”

There was absolutely no need for that.

“Zheng Wanyin was mulling over her words in her heart as she continued, “Cousin, cousin...” ”

“”What’s wrong with your cousin?”Seeing Zheng Wanyin like this, Xie Wanqiu was extremely anxious. “You’re not stuttering! Why Can’t you even speak!” ”

“Zheng Wanyin said in one go, “I don’t think cousin is here to see you. Besides, cousin, Ye Zhuo isn’t here to apologize to you. Grandma, we might have misunderstood.” ”

Not here to apologize to her?

How could that be!

“Then why are your cousin and the others at the hospital?”Xie wanqiu asked.

“Zheng wanyin continued, “I saw that ye Zhuo’s uncle is here as well. He seems to be here for a checkup, so...” ”

“So, Cen Shaoqing was here to see Uncle Ye Zhuo? ”

Impossible!

Xie Wanqiu did not believe it.

Who Was Ye Zhuo’s uncle?

She was Cen Shaoqing’s maternal grandmother.

“Compared to her own maternal grandmother, what was a distant uncle? ”

“Zheng wanyin continued, “But Grandma, don’t be angry. From the way cousin looks, he doesn’t seem to know that you’re in the hospital. If he knew, he would definitely come to see you.” ”
