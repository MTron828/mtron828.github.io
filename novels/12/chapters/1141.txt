“Chapter 1142: 248: Once I see Zhao Xueyin’s true face, I’ll cut her in half! 6”

Translator: 549690339

Did Ye Zao think that he was conducting an experiment?

Using a human life as an experiment?

Zhao Xueyin immediately put down her cup. “Is it that serious?”

“”Of course.”Ma Jiayue nodded. “Otherwise, I wouldn’t have come all the way here just for this!””

Ma Jiayue was a cautious person and never said anything that she wasn’t sure of.

“By saying this, she must be completely confident”

“Thinking of this, the corners of Zhao Xueyin’s lips curled up.”

Great!

This was really great!

“The heavenly axiom had a cycle of reincarnation, and retribution wasn’t pleasant.”

Even the heavens couldn’t stand a scumbag like ye Zhuo!

A human life was at stake.

And Ye Zhuo was practicing medicine without a license!

“With these few incriminating evidence added together, Ye Zhuo was prepared to spend the rest of his life in prison!”

“Zhao Xueyin looked at Ma Jia Yue and asked, “Then when will the patient’s condition worsen?””

“Ma Jia Yue said, “It depends on the individual’s physical condition. Under normal circumstances, it will take about 7-10 days.””

7-10 days?

“Hearing that, Zhao Xueyin had an idea.”

She was waiting for Ye Zhuo’s retribution.

“After a moment, Zhao Xueyin raised her head to look at Ma Jia Yue. “Second aunt, thank you so much.””

“Ma Jia Yue smiled and said, “We’re all family, what are you thanking me for! If you weren’t my niece, would I have helped you?””

“Zhao Xueyin took out two cards from her bag. “Second aunt, I have nothing to thank you for! Take these two shopping cards.””

These two cards were from high-end luxury brands.

“If it were in the past, Ma Jia Yue would definitely have taken them”

“But now, things were different from before.”

Ma Jia Yue stood up with a smile. “It’s as if second aunt really wants these two cards of yours! Keep them and don’t forget second aunt when the time comes.”

Everything was easy to repay.

Only a debt of gratitude was hard to repay.

“Zhao Xue Yin kept the cards and said with a smile, “Look at what second aunt said. Even if I forget someone, I can’t forget you.””

“”Okay, second aunt will be relieved with your words.”Ma Jiayue continued, “Alright, let’s not talk about it anymore. I have something to do, so I’ll leave first.””

“Take care. I’ll go pay the bill.”

“Go ahead.”Ma Jiayue nodded.

“Looking at Ma Jiayue’s disappearing figure, Zhao Xueyin’s eyes were full of pride.”

On the other side.

“After Jiang Xiaoyu came out from the Shunxi Financial Group, he was very depressed.”

It would be a lie to say that she didn’t care about her relationship with Zhao Xueyin for more than twenty years.

She was a human being.

A human being with flesh and blood!

She returned to the Jiang family like a walking corpse.

“Madam Jiang was shocked when she saw Jiang Xiaoyu like this. “Xiaoyu, who bullied you?”” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“”No one bullied me,”Jiang Xiaoyu said weakly. “I’m just in a bad mood.””

“Madam Jiang continued, “Why are you in a bad mood? Tell me quickly!””

“I want to sleep.”Jiang Xiaoyu walked upstairs.

“Madam Jiang was very anxious when she saw Jiang Xiaoyu like this. She knew that old madam Jiang said, “Mom, do you think our Xiaoyu has broken up with someone? Why do I feel that something is wrong with that child?””

“Old Madam Jiang was still a little conservative. She was not very happy when she heard Madam Jiang say that Jiang Xiaoyu had broken up with someone, “What nonsense are you talking about? Our Xiaoyu just returned to the country. Where did she get a boyfriend? I guess she’s just in a bad mood! The child hasn’t been back for three years. It’s inevitable that she won’t be used to her sudden return!””

“You’re right.”Madam Jiang nodded.

Jiang Xiaoyu slept until eight o’clock at night.

“Looking at the dark sky outside the window, Jiang Xiaoyu was already extremely depressed. Now, she was even more depressed.”

She had been abroad for three years.

“Other than Zhao Xueyin, she had lost contact with everyone else. At this moment, even if she wanted to find someone to talk to, she couldn’t find anyone.”

Her life was really a failure!

How about...

Go find ye Zao?

“Thinking of this, Jiang Xiaoyu’s eyes lit up.”

I’ll do it!

Jiang Xiaoyu immediately got up from the bed and walked to the fitting room.

“In a moment, Jiang Xiaoyu walked out of the fitting room.”

She liked to dress in a neutral style since she was young.

Jiang Xiaoyu was wearing a black t-shirt. She didn’t have any makeup on her face. She had a plain face and a pair of ripped jeans on her lower body.

Her short hair that reached her ears was dyed maroon.

“Looking at her like this, it was really hard to tell if she was male or female.”

“After studying abroad, she let herself go even more.”

“However, Zhao Xueyin didn’t like it.”

“She felt that it was neither a man nor a woman. Yesterday, in order to take into account Zhao Xueyin’s feelings, she specially put on a wig and a skirt.”

“From now on, she wouldn’t cater to anyone!”

“Jiang Xiaoyu came downstairs. When Madam Jiang saw her, her expression changed, “Xiaoyu! How did you become like this again? Isn’t it good to be like that during the day? Girls should be like girls! With you like this, who would dare to marry you in the future?””
