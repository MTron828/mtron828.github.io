“Chapter 1280: 270: Big Brother, she made her move! 1”

Translator: 549690339

Father Zhao was immediately stunned.

Wh-what?

Cold sweat broke out on his forehead.

These police found out so quickly?

“No, it can’t be... ”

What about Mike?

Mike was also caught by them?

Who was Mike?

An international top assassin.

How could he be caught so easily?

“”It’s a misunderstanding, it must be a misunderstanding.”Father Zhao tried his best to calm himself down. “Comrade police officers, you’ve made a mistake! I’m a good citizen, I’ve never committed any crimes!” ”

“Captain Li said, “Don’t worry, we, the People’s police, will not let a bad person go, and we will not falsely accuse a good person!”! “Come with US first. If you’re really wrongly accused, we will immediately release you. But you must also know that we, the police, will not arrest you without any evidence!” ”

“Then do you have an arrest warrant?”Father Zhao continued to ask.

Captain Li took out the arrest warrant.

Father Zhao’s heart turned cold when he saw the arrest warrant.

“Ye Sen was still unable to react. He walked to Captain Li’s side and said, “Captain Li, can I ask what happened? What did he do?” ”

“Captain Li looked at ye Sen and said, “Zhao Zhenfei was the mastermind behind this murder.” ”

Zhao Zhenfei was actually the mastermind!

Ye Sen was stunned. His expression was extremely ugly as he stumbled back a few steps.

“Father Zhao quickly explained, “No! It’s not like that! Sen, father was wronged! You have to believe father! Father just found you. Why would father have the heart to hurt you? Don’t listen to those people’s nonsense! They want to sow discord between us father and Son!” ”

Sow discord?

“If father Zhao was really wronged, would the police come with an arrest warrant? ”

Although Ye Sen was a good man.

But he wasn’t stupid.

Why would father Zhao suddenly come to recognize him?

And at such a critical time...

“It must be because after his accident, Father Zhao found out that they were father and son. ”

Disgusting.

It was simply disgusting.

How could he have such a biological father?

“Seeing that ye Sen did not have any reaction, father Zhao looked at Zhao Xueyin, “Xueyin! Father is innocent! Remember to get father a lawyer! Help father clear his name!” ”

Zhao Xueyin was also a little confused.

The police would not arrest someone for no reason.

“Unless, Father Zhao really had something to do with this matter. ”

Idiot!

She was simply an idiot!

“Ye Sen had already accepted her, but now, Father Zhao had actually done such a thing! ”

What should they do now?

“Zhao Xueyin said, “Father, don’t worry, I will definitely find the best lawyer for you!”After saying that, Zhao Xueyin turned to look at Ye Sen and grabbed his arm, “Brother! You must believe father. You are father’s only son. Why would father hurt you? Father has always dreamed of finding you. He will not hurt you!” ”

“Under the current situation, the most important thing was to stabilize ye Sen. ”

Let Ye Sen believe that Father Zhao was not the mastermind.

“Once ye Sen confirmed that Father Zhao was the mastermind, then her plan would be completely ruined. ”

She had just seen hope. She did not want to experience despair so soon!

No.

No.

Zhao Xueyin took a deep breath.

“”You father and daughter, one hired a murderer and the other tortured a cat to death. What else can you not do?”Ye Zhuo turned his eyes slightly. ”

“His tone was light, but it was loud and powerful, tainted with an inexplicable power. ”

Tortured a cat?

“When he caught this adjective, ye sen turned to look at Ye Zao. “Is she the one who skinned fat cat alive?” ”

Fat Cat was the nickname Ye Sen gave brother Meow.

He knew that brother Meow had been tortured to death.

His methods were extremely cruel.

But he didn’t expect that this person was Zhao Xueyin.

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

Ye Sen’s expression changed at that moment.

“Zhao Xueyin panicked. “Brother, things are not what you think, brother...” ”

“Scram!”Ye Sen pointed at the door and said.

Zhao Xueyin did not want to leave just like that.

Ye Zhuo had not treated her face yet.

She had not returned to the financial world!

She was not reconciled!

She was not reconciled!

“”Brother, I was wrong! Can you forgive me, Brother!”Zhao Xueyin knelt on the ground. “Brother, I’m sorry! Brother, I really know my mistake!” ”

Ye Sen was now her only Savior.

She had to hold onto ye Sen tightly!

Ye Sen immediately shook off Zhao Xueyin. “Scram!”

“Zhao Xueyin hugged ye Sen’s thigh. “Brother! We are blood relatives! I’m your only sister. You Can’t treat me like this, brother...” ”

“Ye Sen looked at Ye Zao and closed his eyes. “Zao Zao, I don’t want to see her. Tell her to get lost!” ”

Ye Zao nodded slightly. He picked up his phone and sent a message.
