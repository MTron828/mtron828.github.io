“Chapter 2177: 452: My Face Hurts. If I reveal the past, I’ll torture them! 3”

Translator: 549690339

“Hearing this, the audience below the stage and those watching the live broadcast immediately went to the official website of the Welfare Institute to search for information. ”

The results were found very quickly.

No one had expected such a reversal of events.

Wu Zhicheng was indeed Wu Zihao’s adopted child!

“After learning this result, Zhao Dan’s face, which had improved after much difficulty, turned pale again. Could it be that the equipment had returned to normal? ”

“Otherwise, how could others be able to measure accurately, but only her and Ye Zhuo’s? ”

Yes.

It had to be like this.

“Thinking of this, Zhao Dan continued, “Comrade Judge, I request for a new appraisal!”This time, there would definitely be no mistakes. ”

“”Sure.”The judge continued, “Miss Ye, do you have any questions?” ”

“”No problem,”ye Zhuo said. ”

The two of them walked up to the stage at the same time and pressed their palms again.

Although the answer could be given in a few seconds.

“However, Zhao Dan felt that these few seconds were longer than a few days. ”

She did not know why she was nervous.

She was clearly ye Zao’s biological mother.

“Soon, the voice of the appraisal device sounded again in the air. “After the appraisal, the relationship between Zhao Dan and ye Zao’s paternity test is not tenable.” ”

Not valid.

It was actually not valid again!

How could this be!

“This time, even man Xing’s expression changed. ”

Could it be that Zhao Dan had really mistaken him for someone else?

“Zhao Dan looked at Ye Zhuo, almost unable to maintain his kindness. “It’s You? It Must Be You, right?” ”

“The corners of Ye Zhuo’s mouth curled up slightly. “I’ve never really understood what it means to judge a person by himself. Today, Mrs. Man has really brought this idiom to life. It’s really an eye-opener.” ”

“After saying that, Ye Zhuo turned around slightly and faced the audience and the camera. “I think everyone here and the audience before the live broadcast must be very curious as to why Mr. Man and Madam Man have always thought that I’m a full moon, right?” ”

Zhao Dan’s heart skipped a beat. “What are you trying to do?”

“Ye Zhuo’s red lips parted slightly. “If you don’t do anything wrong, you won’t be afraid of ghosts knocking on your door. Madam Man, don’t be nervous. Now, let me tell you the truth of the whole matter.” ”

“”Actually, a month ago, Mrs. Man came to Chang Yue to look for me. At that time, she came here as My ‘mother.’. “The reason for her visit was probably because I was their long-lost daughter, the full moon. She wanted me to return to the full moon country with her and reunite with her family. “… “At that time, I didn’t give a clear reply to Mrs. Man. “Until, a week later, I gave the throne to Ye Han. At this time, Mrs. Man came to me again. I saw that Mrs. Man wanted to reunite with her deceased daughter’s family so much, so I wanted to help Mrs. Man realize her dream of reuniting with the family of the full moon princess ”

“”But when I promised to go back with Mrs. Man, do you know what Mrs. Man’s answer was? The following is Mrs. Man’s answer.” ”

“After saying that, Ye Zhuo sent out a video. ”

This video was a video of Ye Han and Zhao Dan’s conversation:

“”Full moon? My Full Moon died long ago! Do you really think that any Tom, Dick, or Harry can pretend to be my full moon! Your Sister Is Ye Zhuo, right? She’s the female monarch of Changyue! We can’t reach her!” ”

“”Madam, it’s not right for you to say that! Back then, you were the one who came looking for me and said that my sister was a full moon! And now you’re not admitting it! What do you mean by that? Do you really think that we siblings are easy to bully?” ”

“”I don’t mean anything, I just got the wrong person! Ye Zhuo has nothing to do with our Manxing Kingdom! Please tell your sister to stop Dreaming!” ”

No one expected that ye Han had recorded the video.

Even Zhao Dan himself did not expect it.

“Seeing this, everyone looked at each other and saw the disbelief in each other’s eyes. ”

The Zhao Dan in the video and the Zhao Dan at this moment were two completely different people!

“Ye Zhuo turned off the video and continued speaking, “When Mrs. Man told me not to indulge in wishful thinking, it happened to be after my meditation. At that time, I was neither the lady of Changyue nor Dongli’s fiancée. “I think everyone here is smart enough to guess why Mrs. Man’s attitude was so different from before. You should be able to guess it, right?” ”

“Of course, they could guess! ”

“If they felt that their daughter was useful, they would just take her back. If their daughter was no longer useful, they would just throw her away! ”Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“In the eyes of the man and his wife, their daughter was just an item. If they wanted her, they could take her. If they didn’t want her, they could just throw her away. ”

“Oh my God! I really didn’t expect things to turn out this way. It seems that I’ve been scolding the wrong person all these days!”

[ how could there be such parents? ]

“[ things are still very wrong. If Miss Ye isn’t Zhao Dan’s daughter, why did she agree to go back with Zhao Dan before? Does this mean that miss ye is actually a vain person? ] ”
