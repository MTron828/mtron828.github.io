“Therefore, she could only contact Bai Yuanyuan. ”

“With this thought in mind, Bai Mo hurriedly rolled up the sleeve on her left wrist and pressed the button on her watch. ”

“However, the familiar activation sound did not ring out. ”

What was going on?

Bai Mo’s face became paler and paler.

“Haven’t you noticed a problem?”Liu Chao continued to speak.

“Hearing this, Bai Mo immediately looked up at Liu Chao. ”

“Liu Chao continued, “Your Chip was destroyed. From now on, you, Bai Mo, no longer exist in the S Galaxy.” ”

Bai Mo immediately raised her hand to touch her collarbone.

“In the next second, all the blood in Bai Mo’s body instantly flowed backwards. ”

It was gone.

It was really gone.

What should she do now?

“If she didn’t have the chip, even if she found the interstellar shuttle, she wouldn’t be able to return. ”

“In the s galaxy, every baby would have a chip implanted into their body from the day they were born. ”

This chip would accompany the baby’s entire life.

“If something happened midway, the chip would disappear along with the host, and the host’s information would disappear from the s galaxy’s database. ”

Where was her chip?

“In that instant, Bai Mo panicked. She walked to Liu Chao’s side and grabbed his collar tightly. Her facial features were twisted to the extreme. “What did you do to me? Liu Chao! Do you believe that I’ll kill you? !” ”

Liu Chao did not retaliate against Bai Mo. he just stood there.

Bai Mo became angrier and angrier. She reached out and grabbed Liu Chao’s neck.

“Liu Chao, who had not retaliated at all, flung Bai Mo away at this moment. ”

Bang.

Bai Mo was thrown to the ground. Intense pain came from her body.

It was extremely painful.

“Liu Chao looked down at Bai Mo and said, “Bai Mo, wake up. You’re no longer the high and mighty second miss of the Bai family.” ”

“After saying that, Liu Chao turned around and left. ”

Bai Mo looked at Liu Chao’s back with a vicious look in her eyes.

Wait!

“She had to make Liu Chao pay. Bai Mo clutched the sand on the ground tightly. Because she had used too much strength, her knuckles were slightly white. ”

Liu Chao was not worried at all that Bai Mo would run away.

“Besides him, Bai Mo had no one else to rely on on on Earth. She could not run away at all. ”

“Unless, Bai Mo wanted to live the life that he had lived before. ”

“Spending all his time with rats, he could not bear to see the light of day. ”

...

On the other side.

Lin Ze and Bai Jingshu’s wedding was successfully completed.

Bai Jingshu went to find ye Zhuo and asked about Bai Mo’s situation.

“Ye Zhuo told Bai Jingshu the truth. “Bai Mo is already an ordinary person now. She will no longer have any relations with the s galaxy. Sister-in-law, just pretend that you never had this cousin.” ”

People like Bai Mo should be cut off from each other and never have any contact with each other again. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Otherwise, she would regret it for the rest of her life. ”

“After listening to Bai Mo’s experience, Bai Jingshu sighed. ”

“After all, Bai Mo was once such a proud person. Now that she had fallen from the clouds, she would definitely not be able to accept it. ”

“However, this was all Bai Mo’s retribution. ”

She would not be Mr. Dongguo either.

“”Alright, I understand.”Bai Jingshu grabbed ye Zao’s hand. “Zao, thank you. If it wasn’t for you, I really wouldn’t know how to handle this matter.” ”

Bai Jingshu was different from ye Zao.

Ye Zao was decisive and never hesitated.

“”We’re all one family,”ye Zao said. ”

“Seeing Bai Jingshu like this, Ye Zao was somewhat gratified. ”

“She was most afraid that Bai Jingshu was the kind of person who was indecisive. If that was really the case, then this matter would not be handled properly. ”

“Fortunately, it was not. ”

Bai Jingshu had a clear distinction between gratitude and resentment.

“Bai Jingshu continued, “Your brother and I have already completed the wedding. When are you and Mr. Cen going to organize it?” ”

“”When the time comes, it will naturally be done,”ye Zao said with a smile. ”

Bai Jingshu nodded. “You’re right.”

“Ye Zao continued, “Bai Mo will probably look for you again in the near future. Sister-in-law, you should know what to do, right?” ”

“”Don’t worry,”Bai Jingshu continued, “Zao, don’t worry. I definitely won’t drag your brother down.” ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Oh right, sister-in-law, when are you guys going to hold a baby? I think dad and mom can’t wait any longer.” ”

“Upon hearing this, a bashful expression appeared on Bai Jingshu’s face. ”

“Let nature take its course.”

“Ye Zao said, “Does that mean that you and my brother won’t use contraception?”Ye Zao was a doctor, so when he said this, he didn’t feel that there was anything wrong with it. However, Bai Jingshu was different. Although she was already married.., she was already a married woman, but she was still a little shy to discuss these private matters with outsiders. ”
