“Chapter 1249: 260: Zhao Xueyin’s face is disfigured, and the Zhao family has been expelled from the financial world! 6”

Translator: 549690339

Zhao Xueyin helplessly grabbed her hair and was close to bursting into tears.

“”Ah!”At this moment, the maid’s voice came from the air, “Miss, your... Your Face!” ”

Face?

What happened to her face?

Zhao Xueyin looked up at the maid.

“The maid gulped, “I... I’ll Go get a mirror for you.” ”

“Very quickly, the servant ran over with the mirror. ”

Zhao Xueyin took the mirror and looked at herself inside. She was also shocked.

It wasn’t her!

That wasn’t her!

“The person in the mirror’s face was not only red and swollen, but it was also split open. ”

“The skin was split open, and traces of blood seeped out. ”

She simply couldn’t bear to look at it.

“The strange thing was that her face didn’t hurt at all. Instead, it was very itchy. One couldn’t help but want to reach out to grab it. ”

PA —

Zhao Xueyin directly smashed the mirror on the ground and ran upstairs frantically.

“In the past few days, Father Zhao had asked many people to look for connections, trying to not move out of the financial world. ”

“However, it was useless. ”

“In the blink of an eye, it was the last day. Father Zhao had no choice but to move out of the financial world with Zhao Xueyin. ”

“In the past few days, Zhao Xueyin’s face had deteriorated more and more seriously, even emitting a strange smell. Father Zhao had invited many doctors to see her, and also gave Zhao Xueyin a lot of medicine. ”

“However, not only did the medicine not make Zhao Xueyin’s face better, it made her wound worse! ”

“Gradually, Zhao Xueyin did not dare to use the medicine anymore, and she hated Father Zhao even more. ”

“If it were not for Father Zhao’s Slap, she would not have become like this. ”

This face was Zhao Xueyin’s greatest pride.

But now.

Her face was going to be disfigured.

She was still so young. How was she going to face people in the future! !

“Father Zhao was also very guilty about Zhao Xueyin’s state. “Xueyin, don’t worry. I will definitely get the best doctor to take a look at your face.” ”

Zhao Xueyin sat in the car with her head lowered and did not say a word.

Father Zhao sighed.

“In just a few days, he seemed to have aged by more than ten years. ”

“About four hours later, the car drove out of the financial world and stopped in front of a villa. ”

“The Butler opened the car door. “Master, we’re here.” ”

Father Zhao nodded and got out of the car.

Zhao Xueyin got out from the other side of the car.

“As soon as he got out of the car, Father Zhao saw a familiar figure. ”

But...

Ye Sen?

“When he saw ye Sen, Father Zhao’s eyes were filled with hatred. ”

“If it wasn’t for the Ye family, the Zhao family wouldn’t have fallen to this state. ”

“Since the ye family didn’t let him have it easy, he wouldn’t let the Ye family have it easy either. ”

He wanted the ye family to have no descendants!

Then he would start with Ye Sen.

It just so happened that ye Zhuo wasn’t here.

This was definitely a good opportunity!

Father Zhao narrowed his eyes.

“”Master, we should go in.”It wasn’t until the butler called out that Father Zhao reacted and followed the butler into the villa. ”

“After returning to the villa, Father Zhao opened his contact list and made a call. “Alright, I’ll see you at 8 am tomorrow.” ”

“At 8 am the next day, Father Zhao came to a private teahouse near the Villa. ”

“Not long after, a foreigner wearing glasses with blonde hair and blue eyes sat opposite Father Zhao. “Mr. Zhao.” ” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

This man’s name was Mike.

He came from C Nation and was ranked tenth on the assassin list. He was also one of the top fifteen people in the martial arts world who wanted to kill him.

Mike had worked with Father Zhao many times.

“Mike’s hands were clean and neat, and father Zhao trusted him more. ”

Father Zhao pushed a photo to him. “Three million for this man’s Life!”

Mike put away the photo and looked at it. “No problem.”

“When do you want to do it?”Father Zhao continued to ask.

“I’ll contact you.”Mike took a sip of tea.

“Okay.”Father Zhao nodded.

“On the evening of the third day, Father Zhao received an anonymous text message. ”

Mike was finally going to do it.

“The corners of Father Zhao’s lips curled up, and his eyes were full of viciousness. ”

“Of course, he couldn’t miss such a good show. ”

He wanted to see the ye family disappear into the world one by one with his own eyes.

“First, it was ye Sen. ”

“Then it was ye Shu, then ye Zhuo, then Lin Ze. ”

He wanted ye Langhua to experience the heart-wrenching feeling.

Father Zhao came to a restaurant by the river. He ordered a pot of tea and a plate of exquisite desserts and looked at the beautiful scenery by the roadside.

“Because it was close to the river, there were many people coming and going. ”

Even though it was almost 8 o’clock.

Bang!

“At this moment, a loud noise came from the crowd. ”

Countless people screamed at this time.

The originally peaceful roadside was now in chaos.

Father Zhao’s eyes lit up.

Success!

Father Zhao immediately put down his teacup and walked out with the others to watch the show.

“Although there were many people watching, Father Zhao still squeezed to the front and saw the person lying on the ground. ”

It was ye Sen.

That’s right.

“Seeing ye Sen’s face, Father Zhao heaved a sigh of relief. ”

Ye Sen was ye Zhuo’s uncle.

“Without Ye Sen, Ye Zhuo would definitely be in chaos. ”

What happened next would be easier to handle.

“Not long after, the sound of an ambulance was heard. ”

Ye Sen was carried onto the stretcher.

“Throughout the whole process, father Zhao had been watching and the corners of his mouth curved into a carefree smile. ”

Retribution!

This was the retribution of the Ye family!

“Make Way! Make Way! Everyone make way!”The medical staff carried the stretcher and walked past Father Zhao.

“At this moment, Ye Sen’s arm, which was lying on the stretcher, suddenly slid down from the white blanket. ”

“On his snow-white arm, there was a visible birthmark. ”

Boom.

Father Zhao’s ears exploded with thunder.

What was that?

What did he see?

A red birthmark.

“He was wrong. He must have missed ah ye too much, so he was wrong. ”

How could there be a birthmark on Ye Sen’s hand!

“Father Zhao tried his best to suppress his emotions. He swallowed his throat and tried his best to squeeze forward, trying to prove that he was wrong. ”

“Squeezing forward, Father Zhao saw ye Sen lying on the stretcher and the birthmark on his arm. ”

Father Zhao rubbed his eyes.

But the scene in front of him did not change.

He was not wrong...

He was not wrong. There was indeed a birthmark on Ye Sen’s arm.

Father Zhao immediately turned around and raised his hand in the same direction as ye Sen.

Left hand.

“It was left hand, ”

the birthmark on Ye Sen’s hand was also left hand.

Could it be...

Ye Sen was a Ye?

“If Ye Sen was a Ye, then what kind of stupid things had he done. ”

“Father Zhao stood rooted to the ground, his face devoid of color. ”

“After a long while, he finally reacted. He wanted to follow the ambulance to the hospital, but by then, the ambulance had already gone far away. ”

Ding Ding Ding —

His phone rang in the air. Father Zhao’s hand trembled as he picked up the phone. “Hello.”

“”It’s Mike.”Mike’s voice came from the phone, “I’ve already hit Yesen. Although he didn’t die immediately, he definitely won’t live for more than three days! I hope that Mr. Zhao will be the same as before. Three days later, send the money as promised.” ”

“Father Zhao took a deep breath. “M-mike, can you do me one more favor?” ”

“”Go ahead.”Father Zhao was already a regular customer of Mike’s, so Mike didn’t mind doing him one more favor. ”

“Father Zhao continued, “Investigate ye Sen’s background.” ”

Don’t be a Ye.

Ye Sen must not be a Ye!

Father Zhao prayed in his heart.
