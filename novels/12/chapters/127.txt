Chapter 128: 082: How Does It match with her? She doesn’t even have the slightest discernment! 1

 

Diapers?

Ye Sen couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

Although his eldest niece was usually straight-laced, beautiful, and looked a little cold, there was actually a funny soul hidden deep within her skin.

It could often make people laugh.Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Then black it is,”ye Sen said with a grin. “You girls often say that black makes you look thin and tall. Why Don’t You Wear Black?”

After saying that, Ye Sen took his pants and walked into the room.

He was afraid that ye Zao would say something brilliant again.

At that time, he wouldn’t even be able to wear black pants.

Ye Zao closed the door and went in to change.

Today was the first day of the new year, so of course, he had to wear something festive. Therefore, Ye Zao chose a wine-red waist-pinching coat, black leggings, and a pair of black Martin boots.

The Burgundy contrasted with the plain white, and now it was as white as jade.

It was neatly dressed.

It was valiant, but it did not lack the youthful beauty that a girl of this age should have.

Before leaving the house, Ye Zao picked up a pearl clip from the dressing table and put it beside his ear. The Burgundy pearl clip matched the Burgundy coat perfectly.

When they arrived at the dining room, Ye Shu had already brought breakfast to the table.

Yun Jing’s custom was to eat noodles on the first day of the Lunar New Year.

Besides noodles, there were three tea eggs in the bowl.

The tea eggs on the first day of the Lunar New Year were called golden ingots.

The more one ate, the better the omen.

Although ye Zao was very thin, his appetite was not small. Three tea eggs were nothing to her.

As soon as she put down her chopsticks, Zhou Yuelian and Lin Jinshui’s family of four came over to pay new year’s greetings.

“Happy New Year, Shu!”

“Little Lian, brother-in-law, why are you guys so early? We just put down our chopsticks! Come in and have a seat!”As soon as she finished speaking, Ye Shu looked into the house again. “Zhonghua, Your Aunt Lian and sister Shasha are here!”

Ye Zhonghua hurriedly ran out of the house and greeted them one by one before making tea for everyone.

“Sister Shasha, do you want some fruit tea?”Ye Zhonghua asked while holding the tea leaf in his hand.

“What flavor?”Lin Shasha walked over.

Ye Zhuo looked at the packaging. “I think it’s pineapple and Hawthorn.”

“I’d like some.”Lin Shasha nodded.

“Brother Weiwei, would you like some?”

Lin Weiwei smiled and said, “I’d like some ordinary green tea.”

“Sure.”

After staying at home for a while, Lin Shasha suggested to go out and play. “Zhuozhuo, let’s go out to the temple fair! We saw a lot of people going to the Dragon King Temple on the way here just now!”

“Is it far?”Ye Zhonghua asked.

Lin Sha said, “It’s not very far. Let’s take a 30-minute car ride first, but the Dragon King Temple is on the top of the mountain. There’s no ropeway, so we have to walk up.”

“Are you going to the Dragon King Temple?”Ye Sen walked over and said, “I’m going to pay a new year visit to President Yu, so I’ll take you there on the way.”

“Okay.”Ye Zhonghua nodded and turned to look at Lin Weiwei. “Brother Weiwei, do you want to go with us?”

Lin Weiwei was a very shy big boy. When he talked to Ye Zao, he couldn’t help but blush. “I made an appointment with my high school classmates, so I won’t go with you guys.”

Lin Sha Hugged ye Zao’s arm. “It’s fine if he doesn’t go. Zao, let’s go.”

Ye Sen was a very sentimental person.

Although the efficiency of the express delivery company was getting better and better, he still drove the used van.

Although the van was second-hand, it had been modified by Ye Zhuo, so its performance was very good. It was full of high-quality facilities. In fact, this was the main reason why ye Sen had been reluctant to change cars.

Soon, they arrived at the foot of the mountain where the Dragon King Temple was located.

The car could not go up.

So many people gathered at the foot of the mountain.

Ye Sen got out of the car and opened the door for the two of them. “Eldest niece, Shasha, when do you plan to go home? I’ll come and pick you up.”

Yesen looked up at the Dragon King Temple on the top of the mountain. “I think it’ll take two or three hours! I’ll Call You Then.”

“Okay.”Yesen nodded and reminded the two of them to pay attention to their safety. If anything happened, they would call him and leave.

Yesen and Lin Sha began to walk up the mountain.

The top of the mountain was very shaky, and it was a little difficult to walk.

The two of them walked for an hour before reaching the top of the mountain.

Ye Zhuo and Lin Shasha bought some incense paper and donated some incense money. They entered the temple and kowtowed several times before walking out of the temple.

Today was the first day of the Lunar New Year, and there were many stalls outside the Dragon King Temple.

Eating, drinking, and having fun.

Everything was available.

“Zhuo Zhuo, look, there’s a ring over there. Let’s go take a look,”Lin Shasha said, pointing at the crowd not far away.
