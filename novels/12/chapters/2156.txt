“At this moment, there was another commotion at the entrance. ” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Duanmu Feng looked up and saw a figure in a champagne-colored gown.

She had a pair of delicate eyebrows.

“She was a standard beauty, and there was an amiable look between her brows that made people want to get close to her. ”

“If the people surrounding Duanmu Feng and her only wanted to get close to her, please her, and flatter her, then the people standing beside this woman were all sincere. ”

Man Xing’s popularity was really good.

From 90-year-old people to 9-year-old children.

Anyone who had seen man Xing would be conquered by man Xing’s charm.

Only Duanmu Feng and her did not understand what charm man Xing had.

“Looking at the person who came, Duanmu Feng and her brows furrowed slightly. ”

That Was...

Man Xing.

“Although man Xing had never offended her and she did not get along with man Xing, for some reason, Duanmu Feng and her did not like man Xing. ”

They even disliked him!

And they disliked him very much.

“For example, she was the most dazzling one in the entire family recognition banquet. After Man Xing appeared, everyone’s attention was immediately attracted to him. ”

Man Xing was like a magnet.

“”Miss Duanmu.”While Duanmu Feng and man Xing were deep in thought, the noble man Xing walked to her side and extended his right hand to her. “Hello, I’m man Xing.” ”

“”Hello.”Even though Duanmu Feng didn’t like man Xing very much, she wouldn’t show all of her emotions on her face. Therefore, she still shook hands with man Xing in a friendly manner. ”

“MAN XING continued, “Congratulations, Miss Duanmu. I hope you can help me in the future.” ”

“”Thank you.”Duanmu feng smiled and said, “It’s my honor to have you here, Miss Man.” ”

“”I don’t deserve to be called miss.”MAN XING paused and continued, “I have an elder sister called Full Moon.” ”

“I’m sorry.”Duanmu fengyu immediately realized that she had made a slip of the tongue.

“MAN XING smiled and said, “It’s fine. I Won’t hide it from Miss Duanmu. Actually, I’ve already found some clues about my elder sister.” ”

“Upon hearing this news, everyone was very happy for man Xing. Su Mu immediately asked, “Really?” ”

Man Xing nodded.

“Su Mu then asked, “Then where is Miss Full Moon Now?” ”

The others also looked at man Xing impatiently.

Man Xing was a good person.

Man Jiangshan and Zhao Dan had spent a lot of effort all these years to find the missing full moon. Everyone hoped that they could find the full moon and have a family reunion.

“Man Xing looked at Su Mu and said apologetically, “I’m sorry. Some details are still being verified. It’s not convenient for me to reveal too much...” ”

“Hearing this, everyone nodded to show their understanding. ”

“MAN XING continued, “Don’t worry. Once we confirm that it’s elder sister, I’ll immediately announce this good news to everyone.” ”

“”Alright. Miss Man Xing, we’ll be waiting for your good news.” ”

“Duanmu Feng and man Xing looked at each other, and a glimmer of light flashed in their eyes. ”

What did man Xing mean by this?

Didn’t she feel that she was being pretentious?

“At this moment, man Xing turned to look at duanmu Feng and said, “Miss Duanmu, can we talk in private?” ”

“In front of so many people, she naturally couldn’t reject man Xing. ”

Duanmu Feng and he nodded. “Sure.”

The two of them came to the lounge.

“Man Xing took the initiative to speak, “Miss Duanmu, I know that you’ve never liked me very much. If I’ve done anything wrong, please forgive me. I really didn’t do it on purpose. At home, my mother often told me that I have a bad temper and often offend people.” ”

“At the end of her sentence, man Xing bowed deeply. ”

Duanmu Fengyu was stunned.

She did not expect man Xing to come to apologize to her.

“MAN XING continued, “Miss Duanmu, from now on, you will be the First Lady of the General Alliance. You will be the leader of the women in our S galaxy. I’m afraid that even the commander of the Yue Nation, Miss Ye, will lose her face in front of you. Don’t worry, our man Xing nation will always be loyal to the General Alliance and to You!” ”

“Looking at the obedient Manxing in front of her, Duanmu Feng felt extremely happy. ”

“The Princess of the Manxing Kingdom, who was high and mighty in front of everyone, still had to bow down before her. ”

“At this moment, all of Duanmu Feng’s displeasure towards Manxing disappeared. She smiled and said, “Miss Manxing, you’ve misunderstood. I’m actually a very easy person to get along with. It’s just that I don’t talk much in front of people I don’t know well.” ”

“Since Manxing was so humble, she had to put on airs all the time. ”

Manxing was the legitimate Princess of the full moon kingdom. She would inherit Manxing Kingdom in the future. It wouldn’t do her any harm to have a good relationship with Manxing.
