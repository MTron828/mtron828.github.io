Ye Zhuo’s performance in ‘The village’had increased a lot of his mother’s and grandparents’fans.

“After saying that, the old lady looked at Cen Shaoqing who was beside Ye Zhuo. “Is this your brother?” ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “He’s my boyfriend.” ”

Cen Shaoqing was stunned.

He did not expect ye Zhuo to admit their relationship without any hesitation.

“Cen Shaoqing’s heart was filled at that moment, and all the sense of crisis disappeared without a trace. He smiled at the old lady and said, “Hello, Old Lady.” ”

“The old lady nodded. “Hello! Yezi, I think the young man is a good person. Your taste is really good! The two of you standing together are like a perfect couple!” ”

“Thank you.”

“”Yezi, can we, the old couple, take a photo with you?” ”

Ye Zhuo nodded. “Of course.”

“”Old Man, quickly go in and get the camera.” ”

The old man immediately went in to get the camera.

“Not long after, the old man came out with the camera. He switched the camera to auto-shoot mode and the four of them stood together to take a photo. ”

Ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing played on Changling Island for a week before returning to the city.

Cen Yuyan also boarded the plane back to the capital.

“A week had passed, and there was no longer any trace on Cen Yuyan’s face. ”

“Before boarding the plane, Cen Yuyan sent a message to Zhou Rui, “Dear, I’m back today, the plane leaves at 4 pm.” ”

“When he received this message, Zhou Rui was sitting in the private room of the KTV, hugging his left and right. ”

Why did the old woman come back so soon?

He had not had enough fun yet!

Zhou Rui frowned and threw his phone on the coffee table. He loosened his tie in frustration.

“”Brother Rui, what happened? Did she make you unhappy?”The female partner in his arms saw that Zhou Rui’s expression was not right, so she immediately went over and gave him a kiss. ”

Zhou Rui held the woman’s face and kissed her hard.

Cen Yuyan was almost twenty years older than him.

“How could she compare to these young, beautiful, and energetic girls? ”

“”You kissed her but not me, Rui Ge, you’re too biased.”Another female partner came over. ”

“Soon, a harmonious sound came from the dim KTV. ”

“An hour later, Zhou Rui took out two stacks of cash from his bag and threw them on the table. “These are all yours.” ”

“”Thank you, Brother Rui.”The two female companions did not even have time to put on their clothes and stood up to protect the money in their arms. ”

“After Zhou Rui put on his clothes, he went to the bathroom to wash his face. After making sure that there was no strange smell on his body, he left the KTV and went to the airport. ”

Cen Yuyan’s flight was at 4 o’clock.

“It was now 3:30, half an hour away from 4 o’clock. ”

“Zhou Rui looked at his watch, then went to the flower shop to buy a bouquet of perfume roses. ”

“The moment Cen Yuyan got off the plane, she saw Zhou Rui with fresh flowers in his hands. She ran over with a smile. “Zhou Rui!” ”

“Yuyan.”Zhou Rui opened his arms and hugged Cen Yuyan.

“From the angle that Cen Yuyan couldn’t see, Zhou Rui’s eyes were filled with disgust. ”

“If it wasn’t for money, who would be willing to curry favor with an old woman like Cen Yuyan? ”

“CEN Yuyan continued, “It’s been seven days. Have you missed me?” ”

“”Yes, even in my dreams.”Zhou Rui handed the rose to Cen Yuyan. ”

Cen Yuyan took the rose with both hands and lowered her head to sniff it. Her eyes were filled with happiness.

It was her fortune to be able to meet such a good boy like Zhou Rui. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Zhou Rui continued, “Yuyan, let’s go quickly. I even ordered a candlelit dinner.” ”

“Really?”Cen Yuyan asked.

Zhou Rui gave her surprises every moment. Being with him made Cen Yuyan feel an unprecedented joy.

“Of course it’s true.”Zhou Rui nodded.

The two of them left the airport together and got into the car.

“Cen Yuyan turned to look at Zhou Rui and asked curiously, “Have you not slept well these few days?” ”

“Why do you ask that?”Zhou Rui asked.

“”I see that you have dark circles under your eyes,”Cen Yuyan said. ”

“Zhou Rui’s lie came straight out of his mouth. “You weren’t in the capital these few days, so I thought of quickly settling all the matters on hand. This way, when you come back, I’ll have time to accompany you.” ”

“Hearing this, Cen Yuyan was extremely touched. She turned to look at Zhou Rui. “So, you’ve been working overtime these few days to deal with the company’s matters?” ”

“Yes.”Zhou Rui smiled. “But I didn’t work overtime for too long.”

“He already had dark circles under his eyes, yet he still said he didn’t work overtime for too long? ”

“Cen Yuyan held onto Zhou Rui’s arm and sniffed. “Zhou Rui, thank you.” ”

“Zhou Rui continued, “As long as I can be with you, I’m willing to do anything. So what if I work overtime?” ”
