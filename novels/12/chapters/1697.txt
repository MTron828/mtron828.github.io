“Why are you looking at me! Didn’t you hear what I Said?”Qian you long stared at Tao Lin.

“Tao Lin touched his nose. “Are you, are you sure? That’s s 3.” ”

“”Go, go, Go!”Qian you long waved his hand. ”

“Since Qian You Long had spoken, Tao Lin had no choice but to walk out. ” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

He was a little curious. Could This Qian you long have a bigger backer?

He was not even afraid of S3!

“Qian You Long was very annoyed and did not know how to deal with the Zou family. He looked at Tao Lin’s back and said, “S3? S3 is nothing! Even if S4 comes, I’m not afraid...” Qian you long seemed to have suddenly thought of something and his face turned pale. ”

S3?

Oh My God!

Was it the S3 that he knew of?

“Thinking of this, Qian you long hurriedly called out to Tao Lin. “Come back! Come back! Little Tao, come back!” ”

Tao Lin jogged back. “Director.”

Qian you long scratched his head. “What did you say just now? You saw the S3 logo on Ye Zhuo’s information?”

“Yes.”Tao Lin nodded.

Director Qian was stunned.

How could someone with the S3 logo appear in a small place like Yun Jing?

Was he mistaken?

“An S 3 was a big shot. If he really came to Yun Jing, it was impossible for there to be no news at all. ”

“In other words, if ye Zhuo really was an s 3, then he would be finished. ”

“If offending Zou Feifei was like poking a hornet’s nest, then it was like stirring the soil on the head of the supreme ruler! ”

“Qian Youlong tried his best to calm himself down. He looked at Tao Lin and said, “Could it be that you saw wrongly?” ”

“”I don’t know if I’ve seen wrongly either.”Tao Lin’s expression was very complicated. After all, this was the first time he had seen someone with the S3 logo. Moreover, the other party was such a young lady.., “That’s why I came to look for you.” ”

“How old is Ye Zhuo this year?”Qian Youlong continued to ask.

“The identity information of the S3 was all encrypted. Others simply did not have the authority to look at it. Tao Lin shook his head. “I don’t know either. But from the looks of it, he’s at most eighteen or nineteen years old.” ”

18 or 19 years old.

“When he heard this, Qian you long heaved a sigh of relief. ”

“Although he had never met a big shot of the S3 level, he knew that it was not easy to have such a level. ”

A young girl who was only 18 or 19 years old did not have such ability.

He must have seen it wrongly.

Qian You Long opened the webpage on his computer. “Enter her number and I’ll take a look.”

Tao Lin entered the number that ye Zao had reported in the search bar and clicked on the search button.

The internet speed was very fast.

“The next second, Qian You Long was also stunned. His face was covered in cold sweat as he fell straight onto his chair. ”

It was s 3.

It was really s 3!

“Seeing Qian You Long’s reaction, Tao Lin also knew that things were not looking good. “Sa-chief, what do we do now?” ”

“What do we do? What do you think we should do? Of course we should offer her up! where is her person? where is she now?”Qian you long asked.

“”He’s, he’s in the interrogation room!”Tao Lin said. ”

“It’s over, it’s over. ”

“Not only did they capture him, they even locked him up in the interrogation room. ”

“This time, his official fortune had come to an end! ”

“Director Qian immediately felt a headache coming on, and he immediately walked in the direction of the interrogation room. ”

The most important thing now was to stop the losses in time. He could not make mistakes again and again!

Tao Lin followed director Qian’s footsteps.

The two of them came to the interrogation room one after the other.

“Ye Zao was sitting there, leaning against the back of the chair. Her long legs were crossed and her posture was casual. However, her entire body exuded an aura that could not be underestimated. ”

“She was clearly eighteen or nineteen years old, but it gave people a feeling that she had been washed clean. ”

“”Miss, Miss Ye,”Qian Youlong smiled apologetically and walked carefully to ye Zao’s side. ”

Ye Zao looked back calmly.

“Qian Youlong was so scared that he started to talk incoherently, “Miss Ye, my name is Qian Youlong! I’m really sorry, I was blind. Your Prime Minister is able to push a boat, don’t lower yourself to my level! I didn’t know that your identity had offended you, so I’m here to apologize to you!” ”

“After saying that, Qian Youlong added, “Don’t worry, I’ll definitely return justice to your friend in this matter and let the person who poisoned him receive the punishment he deserves!” ”

“If he had known that ye Zhuo had such a powerful background, he would not have dared to provoke this great Buddha even if he had a hundred guts. ”

What should he do now?

Qian you long could only pray in his heart that Lord ye Zhuo was magnanimous and would not lower himself to his level.

Ye Zhuo’s tone was indifferent. “Ask Wu Jia Guo to come and see me.”

“”Sure, sure!”Qian you long nodded repeatedly. “I will contact team leader Wu immediately. Please follow me to the office first! This is not the place to talk.” ”
