Translator: 549690339

“Seeing her like this, Li Shuyi asked curiously, “Ai Ru, what’s Wrong?” ”

“Ai Ru narrowed her eyes, unable to react in time. “I, that...” ”

She had seen wrongly.

She must have seen wrongly.

Why would Cen Shaoqing appear here?

“Ai Ru wiped her eyes, but the words in front of her did not change. ”

The man dressed in black was really Cen Shaoqing.

Ai Ru was a little agitated. She gulped and pointed at Cen Shaoqing. “Who’s that?”

“You mean that?”Li Shuyi followed ai Ru’s line of sight. “The one dressed in Black?”

“Yes.”Ai Ru nodded.

“Li Shuyi said nonchalantly, “A poor relative of Li Yueyue’s family.” ”

Poor relative?

Cen Shaoqing?

CEN fifth master!

“Are you sure that’s your uncle’s poor relative?”Ai Ru asked.

“Yes.”Li Shuyi nodded. “I saw him at his house before.”

“However, she did not look closely and did not know that Cen Shaoqing and ye Zhuo were so handsome and beautiful. ”

Ai Ru’s expression was a little complicated. “Do you know who he is?”

“”He’s a relative of Li Yueyue’s family,”Li Shuyi repeated. ”

“”What poor relative!”Ai Ru continued, “He’s fifth master Cen.” ”

“Who’s fifth Master Cen?”Li Shuyi asked.

“Ai Ru continued, “He’s from the capital...” ”

“Before ai Ru could finish her sentence, Li Shuyi came to her senses and continued, “Are you talking about fifth master Cen, the number one family in China?” ”

“If one were to talk about fifth master Cen, other than that master, Li Shuyi could not think of anyone else in China. ”

“That’s right.”Ai Ru nodded.

“Hearing that, Li Shuyi laughed out loud. “How is that possible!” ”

That was clearly a poor relative who came to the Li family to fight. How could it be fifth master Cen!

Impossible!

How could the Li family know fifth master Cen.

Who Was Fifth Master Cen?

“He was a man who stood at the top of the pyramid. Even though Li Shuyi grew up abroad, she knew Fifth Master Cen’s name. ”

Even the Jones family couldn’t match up to Fifth Master Cen.

“How could a small Li family, a small Li Yueyue, match up to Fifth Master Cen. ”

“Li Shuyi continued, “Ai Ru, you must have mistaken him for someone else! He can’t be fifth Master Cen!” ”

“”I’m sure I didn’t mistake him for someone else,”ai ru continued, “I went to school with him when I was studying abroad in Xijing.” ”

“At that time, Cen Shaoqing was aloof and unapproachable. He was also a vegetarian and held a Buddhist pearl all day long. During his turbulent adolescence, he was unique and made many girls restless. Unfortunately, the vegetarian Cen Shaoqing had never been tempted. ”

“Really?”Li Shuyi asked.

“Yes.”Ai Ru nodded.

“Li Shuyi still couldn’t believe it. Li Sanzhu was an entrepreneur in a nice way, but in a bad way, he was a sheep farmer. How could he know someone like CEN fifth master? ”

Impossible!

Absolutely impossible!

“”AI ru, how many years have you studied abroad? Are you sure you didn’t recognize the wrong person?” ”

“Ai Ru was sure that she was right. Although eight or nine years had passed, Cen Shaoqing’s appearance had not changed. Moreover, Ai Ru noticed that he was holding a string of Buddhist beads in his hand. ”

“Ai Ru continued, “Wait a moment, I’ll go and Say Hello.” ”

“I’ll go with you.”Li Shuyi followed Ai Ru’s footsteps.

The two of them walked to Cen Shaoqing together.

“Master Five?”Ai Ru asked carefully.

“Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly. When he looked back, he saw Ai Ru. ”

She looked very unfamiliar.

“Ai Ru continued, “Master Five, don’t you remember me? We studied together in Xijing. I’m Ai Ru. I’m the third Ai Ru sitting in the second row to your left.”Ai Ru had studied quite well in class back then, she had even won the honor of being the school Belle. It was a memory of the youth of a generation of boys. It was impossible for CEN Shaoqing not to remember her. ”

“Thinking of this, Ai Ru stood up straight. She maintained a sweet smile on her face and looked at Cen Shaoqing with the best posture. ” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

She did not expect to see Cen Shaoqing in such a place.

“Since they met again, it meant that they were fated. ”

There was a saying in the Buddhist scriptures.

“She looked back 500 times in her past life, only to meet him again in this life. She had been classmates with Cen Shaoqing for half a year, and now they met again. What a great fate this was. ”

“Maybe Cen Shaoqing had a crush on her in her past life and could not get up from kneeling in front of the Buddha. Otherwise, how could she meet Cen Shaoqing again. ”

“She had never dared to think about this in the past, but it was different now. ”

Cen Shaoqing was standing in front of her.
