“What is a future husband?”Ye Zao asked.

“A future husband is someone who can accompany you for life.”Cen Shaoqing hugged her.

“Cen Shaoqing.”

“Huh?”

“You’re so Pretty.”Ye Zao hooked his arm around his neck. His red lips pressed against his thin lips and kissed him.

Cen Shaoqing was stunned for a moment.

“The Drunk Ye Zao was much more proactive than usual, and his hands and feet had become disobedient. ”

“Cen Shaoqing was not strong-willed to begin with, and at this moment, he was even more restless. He wished that he could immediately punish the person under him, but his rationality told him that he could not. ”

Hold it in.

Taking advantage of others’danger was not the work of a gentleman.

“As they kissed and kissed, Ye Zao fell asleep. ”

Cen Shaoqing sighed. This ancestor really knew how to torment people!

“At this moment, the car slowly came to a stop. ”

Cen Shaoqing opened the elevator board.

“The driver immediately got out of the car and went around to the back seat. He opened the car door and said, “Master five, we have arrived.” ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly and carried ye Zao out of the car.

“As soon as he got out of the car, Ye Zao woke up and struggled to get out. “Put me down. I can walk on my own.” ”

“Helpless, Cen Shaoqing had no choice but to put ye Zhuo down. ”

Ye Zhuo stood on the ground and felt that the world was spinning. It was very uncomfortable.

“Seeing that she was swaying, Cen Shaoqing immediately reached out to help her up. ”

Ye Zhuo shook Cen Shaoqing’s hand away. “I don’t need you to help me up. Help me up properly and don’t let the ground shake. I can walk properly!”

Cen Shaoqing:”...”

“”Hurry up and help me up!”Seeing that Cen Shaoqing did not move for a long time, ye Zhuo could not help but urge him. ”

Cen Shaoqing held his forehead slightly. “You’re drunk. I’ll Carry You Back.”

“You’re the one who’s drunk! Your whole family is drunk!”Ye Zhuo patted his chest. “Don’t you know that I’m not drunk even after a thousand cups?”

Cen Shaoqing:”...” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“At this moment, Ye Zhuo said in surprise, “White Dragon Horse!” ”

White Dragon Horse?

Where did the White Dragon horse come from?

“Before Cen Shaoqing could react, ye Zhuo staggered to the side and hugged the white samoyed that was tied under the tree, he said bitterly, “White Dragon Horse! Who tied you here! The flowers that I found for you are all gone!” ”

The Samoyed that was hugged by Ye Zhuo:”...”

Cen Shaoqing sighed helplessly. He really owed his ancestors in his previous life!

“When Ye Zhuo woke up again, a white dog’s head was staring at her without blinking. ”

Ye Zhuo was stunned.

Whose Dog was this?

Where was she?

“The next second, when ye Zao saw the decorations in the room, he realized that this was Cen Shaoqing’s residence. ”

Why was she at Cen Shaoqing’s residence?

Wasn’t she drinking with Li Yueyue at the Qing Bar?

“At this moment, ye Zao vaguely remembered that Cen Shaoqing seemed to have come to pick her up when they were halfway through drinking. She could not remember what happened after that. ”

Ye Zao raised her hand and pressed on her temple. She felt a slight headache.

She did not know what had happened until she raised her hand. She was shocked when she saw that there was a dog rope tied to her wrist.

A dog rope!

Why was there a dog rope tied to her wrist?

“Also, whose dog was this? ”

What exactly happened?

Ye Zao looked at the Samoyed’s dog head with a confused expression. The Samoyed also looked at Ye Zao with a confused expression. The Man and the dog stared at each other.

“At this moment, faint footsteps came from the living room. ”

It was Cen Shaoqing?

“Cen Shaoqing?”Ye Zao called out.

“You’re Awake?”Cen Shaoqing walked in from outside with a towel on.

“He was wearing a black bathrobe with a ribbon of the same color tied around his waist. It was loose and loose, and one could vaguely see the perfect mermaid line and abdominal muscles hidden in the fabric. ”

“He was used to his formal attire and meticulous manner. When he suddenly saw his bathrobe, ye Zao was momentarily stunned. ”

“If one had to describe the scene in front of him in four words, it would be that he was seductive. ”

The beauty came out of the shower.

Ye Zao looked at him and raised his eyebrows slightly. “Why are you taking a shower in broad daylight?”

“Hearing this, Cen Shaoqing only wanted to press ye Zao onto the bed and beat him up! ”

“If she had not made his blood boil, would he have taken a cold shower to put out the fire in such a cold day? ”

Cen Shaoqing opened his thin lips slightly. “Because you vomited all over me.”

Ye Zhuo was stunned. “I vomited?”

“What do you think?”Cen Shaoqing asked back.

Ye Zhuo frowned slightly. “But I remember that I never vomited when I was drunk.”

“Then do you still remember who it is?”Cen Shaoqing shifted his gaze to the White Samoyed on the ground.

“Ye Zhuo raised his wrist. “I was just about to ask you, why is there a dog leash on my wrist. Who Is It?” ”

“Cen Shaoqing raised his eyebrows slightly. “What, you don’t Even Know Your Beloved Disciple?” ”
