“The shop assistant said, “Yes, as long as your phone has traffic, you can check it no matter where you are.””

“Okay.”Zhou Zuolong handed the phone to the shop assistant. “Help me install it.”

“”Old Sir, please unlock it.”The shop assistant handed the phone back to Zhou Zuolong.”

Zhou Zuolong unlocked the phone.

It had been half an hour since he came out of the shop.

“Little did he know that as soon as he walked out of the store, Zhou Jinbei walked out of the experience store next door.”

Zhou Jinbei looked at Zhou Zuolong’s back and narrowed his eyes.

“Next, he just needed to quietly enjoy a dog-eat-dog drama.”

“In fact, when Zhou Jinbei learned about Xie wanqiu and Wu Youyu’s relationship, he was also shocked.”

He had never thought that Xie wanqiu would betray Zhou Zuolong.

Maybe.

“This was the legendary retribution, right?”

Zhou Zuolong betrayed Wu Lan and Xie wanqiu together.

“And now, Xie Wanqiu betrayed Zhou Zuolong again!”

The heavens have eyes!

“”Mom,”Zhou Jinbei looked up at the sky. “Did you see it from the Sky?””

“After leaving the shop, Zhou Zuolong specially went to a doll shop to look around. He bought a doll and put the surveillance equipment into the doll bag. After doing all this, Zhou Zuolong called Wu Youyu, “Brother Wu, where are you now?””

Wu Youyu looked up at the entrance of the second hospital. “I’m already at the hospital entrance.”

“I’ll come and pick you up right away.”

“Okay.”

“Soon, Zhou Zuolong trotted over and appeared in front of Wu Youyu. “Brother Wu.””

“Brother Zhou!”Wu Youyu waved at Zhou Zuolong.

“Zhou zuolong smiled and said, “Brother Wu, I’m really sorry. I was going to come downstairs to pick you up. When I passed by the doll shop, I thought of buying a doll to decorate the ward and give Wanqiu a change of mood! The atmosphere in the ward is really too depressing!””

“”It’s okay, it’s okay,”wu youyu continued, “Then let’s go up first.””

“Okay.”Zhou Zuolong nodded.

“Soon, the two of them arrived at the ward.”

“Zhou Zuolong placed the two dolls on the cabinet. “Wanqiu, brother Wu is here to see you!””

“Brother youyu.”Xie wanqiu looked up at Wu Youyu.

Zhou zuolong sized up the two of them without a trace.

“Looking at them like this, there was nothing unusual about the two of them getting along.”

Someone must be framing Xie wanqiu.

“Zhou zuolong smiled and said, “WANQIU, do you think this pair of dolls I bought looks good?””

“Yes.”Xie wanqiu nodded.

“Zhou zuolong continued, “Wanqiu, you have a good chat with brother Wu. I’ll go downstairs to buy some fruits. We’re going back to sea city soon. It’ll be difficult if we see brother Wu again in the future.””

“Xie Wanqiu was stunned. “Old Man, when are we going back?””

“Zhou zuolong said, “After we settle the matter with that unfilial daughter, we’ll go back.””

“What about yinyin?”Xie wanqiu asked.

“Zhou zuolong continued, “Yinyin will stay at the Cen family. You’re right. Zhou Xiang is a person without a mind of his own. If yinyin doesn’t stay at the Cen family, the Cen family will be defeated by Zhou Xiang and ye Zhuo sooner or later.””

“Alright.”Xie wanqiu nodded.

“Zhou Zuolong picked up his phone. “Then I’ll be leaving first. Brother Wu, Keep Wanqiu Company for a while.””

“Okay.”Wu Youyu nodded.

“After saying that, Zhou Zuolong closed the door and walked out. Just as he got off the elevator, he saw Xie Rongle and Zheng Wanyin walking up.”

“Zhou zuolong said, “Yinyin. “Your Grandpa Wu is here to chat with your grandmother. I’m planning to leave Beijing after settling the matter with Zhou Xiang. You and your aunt shouldn’t go up and disturb them. After we leave Beijing, it’ll be difficult for them to see each other again.””

“At the end of his sentence, Zhou Zuolong sighed.”

“Zheng Wanyin nodded, but she snorted coldly in her heart.”

Other people would sneak around behind their husbands’backs.

“Zhou Zuolong, on the other hand, personally sent his wife to Wu Youyu’s bed.”

He had never seen such a stupid person!

No wonder he had been deceived by Xie Wanqiu for so many years.

He really deserved to be deceived!

“Zheng Wanyin turned to look at Xie Rongle. “Cousin, shall we go have afternoon tea then?””

“Okay.”Xie rongle nodded.

In the ward.

Wu Youyu had been leaning against the window the whole time.

“Xie wanqiu lowered her voice and said, “Have you left?””

“Not yet.”

Xie wanqiu frowned slightly. “Why is it taking so long?”Isn’t that a little abnormal?

“At this moment, Wu Youyu continued, “I’ve left, I’ve left. Yinyin and RONGLE have left too. This Zhou Zuolong is really too stupid!””

“Hearing that Zhou Zuolong had finally left, Xie wanqiu heaved a sigh of relief.”T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m
