L frowned.

Could it be that a living person would disappear into thin air?

“At this moment, yaler suddenly said, “There is another possibility.” ”

“What possibility?”L asked.

“”An changed her clothes,”Yaler said. ”

“Hibbert quickly reacted, “That is to say, from 2 o’clock onwards, anyone who walks out of the casino could be An?” ”

“Yes.”Ale nodded.

This was a bit difficult.

“Ranito was a famous gambling city in the country. There were a total of 10 gates, and the traffic at each gate was very high. ”

It was almost heel-to-heel.

“To find An among these people was as difficult as ascending to heaven, ”

“”So,”Hibbert continued, “The most urgent thing is to find Carl.” ”

“Alar turned to look at L. and asked, “This Carl is from China?” ”

“Yes.”L. nodded and transferred the computer to Carl’s profile page. “Carl is 26 years old this year. He’s from China’s biter city.”

Alar nodded and turned to look at Hibbert. “Go and find this Carl right now.”

Finding a well-known Chinese with a height and appearance was much easier than finding a Chinese who didn’t know anything.

Hibbert nodded. “I’ll make the arrangements right away.”

“L said, “I’ve checked. Carl is not a simple person. He has a connection with the ABA. If you want to find him, you might have to spend some effort.” ”

Aba?

Yaler narrowed his eyes. “Does that mean that An is also related to the ABA?”

“If that was really the case, things would be a little tricky. ”

“L shook his head. “An is An, Carl is Carl. Although Carl is related to ABA, it doesn’t necessarily mean that An is related to ABA.” ”

“Hearing this, Yala heaved a sigh of relief. ”

...

On the other side.

Carl was standing on the streets of Beijing in China. He looked at the flight ticket information and immediately made a call.

“Soon, the call was connected. ”

“Hello.”A clear and shallow female voice came from the other side.

“An?”

“Hearing this address, Ye Zao was stunned for a moment, then he said, “What’s the matter?” ”

“”An, I’m going back to China soon. The flight is at 4 o’clock this afternoon.” ”

“Ye Zao was about to say that he had a safe journey when he suddenly thought that the term “Safe journey”was not suitable for flying. He quickly said, “Have a safe journey.” ”

His tone was a little lazy.

“Carl continued, “An, we’re brothers after all. I’m going back to China. As brothers, you should at least come and send me off, right?” ”

“Although he had met ye Zhuo many times, ye Zhuo kept a tight lid on every time they met. ”

“Until today, Carl had never seen ye Zhuo’s true face. He was quite curious. ”

“Originally, Carl thought that he would be able to see ye Zhuo when he came to Beijing this time. ”

He didn’t expect that his efforts would come to naught.

“”I’m not free.”Recently, Ye Zhuo had a lot of things to do. ZY’s new season, Shunxi Financial Group’s annual Grand Ceremony, LK Group’s design, as well as the Chinese painting and calligraphy world, “But I should make a trip to C nation during this period of time. I’ll See You Then.” ”

“Okay.”Carl’s voice was more or less regretful. “Then I’ll see you in C Nation.”

“”Okay, I’ll see you in C Nation.” ”

“Just as Carl was about to say something more, ye Zao hung up. ”

“Ye Zao Hung Up the phone, and Cen Shaoqing walked in from the door. “Leader, who called?” ”

“”A brother,”ye Zhuo said. ”

A brother?

Cen Shaoqing was stunned.

Shouldn’t they be sisters?

“Had their leader been too busy recently, and his mind was Dizzy? ”

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “Uncle just called and asked us to go back for dinner tonight.” ”

“Ye Zhuo was stunned. Only then did he remember that since the last time, she had not gone back for more than a month. “Okay, then we’ll leave early tonight.” ”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“At half past five in the afternoon, Ye Zhuo finished all his work and arrived at Cen Shaoqing’s office. ”

“Cen Shaoqing was sitting in front of his desk, processing documents. ”

“Seeing her come over, the secretary was about to speak, but she saw ye Zhuo put his index finger to his lips and made a gesture of ‘silence’. ”

The secretary immediately understood and did not say anything.

“Ye Zhuo walked lightly behind Cen Shaoqing, reached out to cover his eyes, and said in a different voice, “Guess Who I am?” ”

The Secretary looked at Ye Zhuo with surprise in her eyes. She thought she was hallucinating.

This... This was Cen Yueya’s voice!

The secretary had been by Cen Shaoqing’s side for many years and knew the CEN sisters’voices very well.
