Translator: 549690339

Lin Ze was the top scorer!

“He stood out from the 60,000 people. ”

One could imagine how hard Lin Ze worked.

Lin Jincheng nodded.

“Old Lady Lin continued, “Why did you come out of the sanatorium? Your body has recovered? There are no problems?” ”

“”There are no big problems,”Lin Jincheng replied. ”

“”Ah Ze got the top scorer this time. I plan to let the eldest, second, third, and fourth come back to celebrate Ah Ze. After so many years, our Lin family has finally produced a top scorer!” ”

Lin Jincheng nodded slightly. “I’ll make the arrangements.”

“Old Lady Lin shook her head. “You’re not well, and you’re usually busy with company matters. I’ll make the arrangements for such a small matter.” ”

“That’s fine too.”Lin Jincheng didn’t have much expression on his face.

“Although he and old Madam Lin were mother and son, the relationship between them was no longer what it was back then. Facing Old Madam Lin, he didn’t have anything else to say. He stood up and said, “I’ll go back to my room first.” ”

“”Okay, I’ll get doctor Su to come over later. You rest well.” ”

“Old Madam Lin looked at Lin Jincheng’s back, and she couldn’t tell what expression was on her face. ”

She knew. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Lin Jincheng still hated her.

Nineteen years had passed.

“Ever since that incident, he had never said a single word to her. ”

“But what happened between him and Ye Shu, could she be blamed? ”

“If she had not stopped that incident in time,. ”

Lin Jincheng would have married ye Shu long ago.

Then this cuckold would be very strict.

Raising a child for someone else.

The paper can’t cover up the fire.

“When that time comes, won’t everyone in the capital laugh at the Lin Family? ”

Sigh!

Old Mrs. Lin Sighed.

“In the end, it was all that bitch ye Shu’s fault. ”

“If she hadn’t interfered and seduced Lin Jincheng, the Lin family wouldn’t be like this. ”

Lin Jincheng didn’t have a wife.

Lin Ze didn’t have a mother.

“If Lin Ze’s mother was Feng Qianhua, then he would definitely be more outstanding than now. ”

Thinking of Ye Shu.

Old Lady Lin’s eyes were full of hatred.

She wished ye Shu could die right away!

Lin Jincheng came to the bedroom upstairs.

His bedroom was very clean.

“Although he hadn’t lived in it for a long time, the maids would come up every month to change the bedsheets and bedding, so it didn’t look like nobody lived in it. ”

Lin Jincheng lay on the bed.

He stared blankly at the ceiling.

Suddenly.

He saw a woman’s face smiling at him.

Who was this person?

“Looking at Lin Jincheng, his eyes suddenly turned red, and a name came out of his mouth. “Ah Shu...” ”

Ah Shu?

Who Was Ah Shu?

“Lin Jincheng suddenly felt as if he had forgotten something, so he quickly grabbed his phone and made a call. “Secretary Zhang, who is Ah Shu?” ”

“Secretary Zhang’s voice came from the other end of the phone, “President Lin, have you forgotten about those things again?”? “Madam’s full name is Ye Shu. There is a secret compartment in the safe in your room. There is a photo in the secret compartment. The person in the photo is madam. There is also a letter that you personally wrote to Madam.” ”

After hanging up the phone.

“Lin Jincheng quickly went to open the safe. According to Secretary Zhang, he found a photo and a letter in the safe. ”

The door to his memories slowly opened.

Lin Jincheng was immersed in his memories.

Lin Ze lived in the room next door.

“Lin Ze was sitting in front of his computer, his fingers constantly tapping on the keyboard. ”

The air was filled with crackling sounds.

“After he finished, he saved the document. ”

“In the document sending list, there was a person named [ director Wang ] . ”

“After sending the document, Lin Ze found ye Sen in his friends list and found that the department was for Ye Sen: [ Uncle Ye, my college entrance exam results are out. ] ”

Ye Sen was probably busy and did not reply immediately.

“Lin Ze then sent a message: [ Uncle Ye, how are you doing in Yunjing? ] ”

“[ oh right, I got into the top scholar in the liberal arts in Beijing. ] ”

[ do you think my mother would be very happy if she knew this news? ]

The first person Lin Ze wanted to share with was his mother after getting into the top scholar in the liberal arts.

It was a pity.

He didn’t even know who his mother was.

Lin Ze looked at his phone screen and a helpless smile appeared on his face.

“At the other end of the screen, Ye Sen was busy treating his employees to hotpot. ”

There were more than 500 people in the headquarters.

He had to call the Hotpot restaurant in advance and get ready.

“After settling the company’s matters, Ye Sen turned on his phone and was ready to share the good news with Bai Wei. ”

Only then did he see the message from Lin Ze.

He opened the message.

Yesen sighed.

This was also a poor child.

“Although he was born rich, he didn’t have a mother since he was young. ”
