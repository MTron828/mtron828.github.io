“”Don’t Cry, Don’t Cry!”Old Mrs. Cen hugged Zhou Xiang and patted her back with her right hand. “MOM is here! No matter what, Mom will never leave you.” ”

“Seeing Zhou Xiang like this, Old Mrs. Cen’s heart ached terribly. ”

“All these years, she had long treated Zhou Xiang as her own daughter. ”

“After crying for a while, Zhou Xiang gradually calmed down and looked up at Old Mrs. Cen. “Mom, is everything Shaoqing said true?” ”

Zhou Xiang felt like she was in a dream.

“In the dream, Cen Haifeng was still alive. He had forgotten everything and had a new wife in another world. They were a loving couple and the moon was full. ”

Was It a dream?

It must be a dream.

Zhou Xiang looked at Old Mrs. Cen with anticipation in her eyes.

“”It wasn’t a dream,”old Mrs. Cen continued, “Xiangxiang, all of this is true.” ”

“Although she did not want to admit it, it was the truth. ”

“After saying that, old Mrs. Cen continued, “I did not educate my child well. Xiangxiang, I have let you down...” ” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Old Mrs. Cen was very blaming herself now. All these years, she had always thought that she had let Zhou Xiang down. Who knew that she was the one who had let Zhou Xiang down the most. ”

Zhou Xiang just looked at Old Mrs. Cen without any reaction.

There were only three words left in her ears.

It wasn’t a dream.

Why wasn’t it a dream?

Why?

“She had always thought that their love was pure and worthy of being treasured. But now, time was telling her. ”

Her former husband had already found a family elsewhere.

“Seeing Zhou Xiang like this, old Mrs. Cen felt even more ashamed. “Xiangxiang, if you really can’t take it anymore, hit me a few times. It’s all because I didn’t do my duty as a mother...”she would put this beating on Cen Haifeng, after she saw that unfilial son, she would beat that unfilial son to death! ”

“”Mom, I Don’t blame you for this. I Don’t blame you at all.”Zhou Xiang looked at Old Mrs. Cen. “Please don’t blame yourself...” ”

Old Mrs. Cen was a victim just like her.

She had waited for Cen Haifeng all her life. Didn’t old Mrs. Cen wait for the Cen family’s old man all her life?

No one was to blame for this.

“If she was to blame, she could only blame her fate! ”

Her fate was not good.

“Seeing Zhou Xiang like this, old Mrs. Cen blamed herself even more. No matter what, it was Cen Haifeng who had let Zhou Xiang down, and she was Cen Haifeng’s mother. ”

“”Xiangxiang, don’t worry. I will definitely seek justice for you!”Old Mrs. Cen continued. ”

“Zhou Xiang held old Mrs. Cen’s hand and continued, “I want to ask him now if he has really forgotten me.” ”

She did not believe that Cen Haifeng would forget her.

She also did not believe that Cen Haifeng had a home outside.

“They had such deep feelings for each other, how could they forget it just like that? ”

“Seeing her like this, old Mrs. Cen sighed and did not know how to comfort Zhou Xiang. ”

“”Mom,”Cen Yuying walked in from outside the door, she continued, “Actually, father has his own difficulties. From what Shaoqing said, he was controlled by the people over there. He did not deliberately forget you. I believe that if father was conscious, he wouldn’t have done such a thing.” ”

“At this moment, he could only comfort Zhou Xiang. ”

“Hearing this, Zhou Xiang’s expression changed. ”

“At this moment, a servant came over with a bowl of porridge. CEN yuying took the porridge from the servant. “Mother, have some porridge first.” ”

Zhou Xiang shook her head. “I’m not hungry.”

People who were in extreme grief did not feel any hunger.

“”Mom, eat something.”Cen Yuying scooped up a spoonful of porridge with a spoon and handed it to Zhou Xiang’s mouth. “You haven’t eaten anything for a day. If you continue like this, your body will not be able to take it.” ”

Zhou Xiang still shook her head.

“CEN yuying continued, “Mom, we haven’t seen dad yet. If you starve yourself to death, how can you confront him face to face?” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen took the spoon from Cen Yuying and handed the food back to Zhou Xiang’s mouth, “You’re right, Big Girl. A man is made of iron and steel. You Can’t not eat anything. If you don’t eat anything, you won’t be able to see that unfilial son!” ”

“Hearing that, Zhou Xiang took the spoon. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen smiled and said, “Yes, yes, yes. This is my good child. Eat more. Let’s go and confront him together!” ”

“Zhou Xiang took the bowl from old Mrs. Cen. “Mom, I’ll do it myself.” ”

Old Mrs. Cen was an elder. How could she let an elder feed her.

“Seeing that Zhou Xiang was finally willing to eat, both old Mrs. Cen and Cen Yuying heaved a sigh of relief. ”
