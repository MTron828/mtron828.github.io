Translator: 549690339

“Li Qiandong was fifth master Cen’s best friend to begin with. Mu Yourong had even conquered Li Qiandong, so conquering fifth master Cen would definitely not be a problem. ”

It seemed that he would become fifth master Cen’s father-in-law one day!

“Thinking of this, soldier Mu’s face was once again covered with a smile. ”

Good!

Very good! FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

This was really too good!

“Once Mu Yourong married Fifth Master Cen, let alone the cloud capital, their MU family would also have to split half of the capital! ”

“Mu Yourong went upstairs to make some preparations. She changed out of her business suit, put on some nude makeup, and put on a light silk dress. She was prepared to meet Li Qiandong by chance. ”

“Li Qiandong looked like a playboy, but he actually paid quite a bit of attention to charity. ”

He would occasionally go to the orphanage to take a look.

“According to the system’s inquiries, Li Qiandong’s itinerary this afternoon was to go to the Angel Orphanage not far from the city. ”

Mu Yourong had to go over in advance to make preparations.

In the afternoon.

Li Qiandong and his secretary had just entered the orphanage when they saw a beautiful young woman playing chicken with the children.

“She was wearing a silk dress. As she moved, her dress fluttered in the wind, looking especially beautiful. ”

“For a moment, Li Qiandong was stunned by what he saw. ”

“Sensing Li Qiandong’s gaze, Mu Yourong’s eyes flashed with pride. She tried her best to make her movements and smile look more natural. ”

“If Zy’s founder was also a man, then he would definitely be like Li Qiandong and become her subordinate! ”

“It had to be her, and she was willing to give up everything for her. ”

Who knew!

ZY’s founder was actually that little slut ye Zhuo.

“Thinking of the humiliation she had suffered, Mu Yourong’s gaze instantly became sinister and fleeting. ”

“Yourong.”Li Qiandong tried his best to control his heartbeat and walked to Mu Yourong’s side.

“Big Brother Li?”Mu Yourong pretended to be very surprised as she looked at Li Qiandong. “Why are you here as well?”

“Li Qiandong said, “I’m here to see the children.” ”

“Mu yourong smiled and said, “What a coincidence. I’m also here to see the children.” ”

“The children at the side immediately said, “Sister Rong often comes to see us!” ”

“Actually, this was Mu Yourong’s first time coming. ”

The reason why the children said this was because Mu Yourong had given them benefits in advance.

“Mu Yourong had also promised them that if they cooperated well with her and finished today’s performance, she would fulfill each of their wishes! ”

Li Qiandong looked at Mu Yourong in great surprise.

He knew that Mu Yourong was a kind-hearted and good girl.

“If she really was the green tea that Cen Shaoqing was talking about, would she have come to the orphanage to visit the children? ”

What a pity!

“Not only was Cen Shaoqing a little blind, he also did not listen to advice... ”

Perhaps it was because powerful people had some flaws.

And Cen Shaoqing’s flaw was that he could not see people clearly.

“Li Qiandong continued, “Yourong, your kindness will definitely be rewarded well.” ”

“Mu Yourong looked into the distance, a hint of worry appearing in her eyes. She frowned and said, “I don’t ask for anything in return. I only hope that these children can lead a better life! Moreover, not everything you put in can be rewarded.” ”

“Seeing Mu Yourong’s frown, Li Qiandong felt a little uncomfortable. “Yourong, did you run into trouble?” ”

“”No, Big Brother Mu, what kind of trouble could I run into?”Mu Yourong pretended to deny it firmly. ”

“The more Mu Yourong denied it, the more Li Qiandong felt that there was something on Mu Yourong’s mind, he continued, “Yourong, we’re best friends. If there’s anything, just tell me directly. As long as it’s something I can help with, I’ll definitely help you.” ”

“Mu Yourong shook her head. “It’s really nothing, Big Brother Li. Thank you for your kindness.” ”

“”Really nothing?”Li Qiandong asked, somewhat worried. ”

“Really nothing.”

“Speaking up to this point, Mu Yourong changed the topic and continued, “Big Brother Li, do you know what my greatest wish is?” ”

“What is it?”Li Qiandong was very curious.

“Mu yourong smiled and said, “My greatest wish is that one day, there will be no orphans in our country! All children will be born into a happy family!” ”

Li Qiandong felt that Mu Yourong’s entire being was glowing at this moment.

“One could ask, in this world where benefits were so important, how many people could be as kind as mu yourong! So pure! ”

“Mu Yourong sighed, then she said, “Brother Li, look at how cute these children are! I don’t know how their parents were so cruel to throw them away! Perhaps they have their own unspeakable reasons? But no matter what happens, they shouldn’t throw away their own children!” ”
