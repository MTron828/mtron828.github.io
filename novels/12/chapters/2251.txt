“Moreover, she took the initiative to question whether man Wen was Bai Jingshu’s boyfriend. This way, she would not expose her own thoughts. ”

What was this called?

“This was called walking one’s own path, leaving others with no path to walk. ”

“Bai Jingshu immediately explained, “No, Momo, you misunderstood. I’m just a normal friend of man Wen. Oh right, Man Wen, let me introduce you. This is my cousin, Bai Momo.” ”

Manwen nodded at Bai Momo. “Hello.”

“”Hello.”Bai Momo looked at Manwen and unconsciously bit her index finger. She continued, “You, I, I seem to have seen you somewhere before! You look so familiar! SIS, have I seen brother Manwen before?” ” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Bai Jingshu was somewhat unable to react when Bai Momo suddenly became like this. The usual Bai Momo was also not like this.

“”Manwen is the president of Manxing Country,”Manxing explained. ”

“Hearing this.., bai Mo said in surprise, “So Brother Manwen is the president of Manxing country. No wonder I look so familiar! “SIS, you’re really amazing. You can actually become good friends with brother Manwen. You’re practically the person I admire!” ”

“Bai Mo kept calling him brother Manwen, and it was very easy for her to call him that. ”

“After saying that, Bai Mo hugged Bai Jingshu’s arm and continued, “Sis, where are you guys going later? Can you bring me along?” ”

“Hearing this, Bai Jingshu could basically understand Bai Mo’s true motive. ”

She was not trying to get drunk.

“Manwen continued, “Jingshu, bring your sister to play. I still have something to do, so I’ll head back first.” ”

“”Brother Man Wen, let’s add our contact details!”Bai Mo continued, “There are many people around me who admire you. I want to show them that I am good friends with the most powerful person in Manxing Kingdom!” ”

“Man Wen furrowed his brows and wanted to reject Bai Mo’s request. However, as Bai Mo was Bai Jingshu’s younger sister, he was a little embarrassed to reject her. He could only nod and say, “Alright.” ”

“The two of them added each other’s contact details. Bai Mo was very excited. “Brother Man Wen, thank you!” ”

“”You’re welcome.”Man Wen looked at Bai Jingshu. “Then I’ll take my leave first. If you have any questions, contact me.” ”

“Okay.”Bai Jingshu nodded. “You can go back first.”

Man Wen turned around and left.

“Bai Mo looked at man Wen’s back. Adding the contact details was only the first step. Just you wait. Sooner or later, she would make man Wen her subordinate. He had to be her. ”

“Where are you going to play?”Bai Jingshu turned to look at Bai Mo..

“At a time like this, Bai Mo naturally wouldn’t offend Bai Jingshu. After all, Bai Jingshu’s relationship with Manwen wasn’t ordinary. ”

“Bai Mo held Bai Jingshu’s arm. “SIS, you can go to my house. I have something to give you.” ”

“”Mo Mo, I appreciate your kindness, but I still have to return to Earth in a while, so I won’t go to Your House,”Bai Jingshu said. ”

“Bai Momo looked at Bai Jingshu and continued, “SIS, you can’t go back to Earth now.” ”

“Why?”Bai Jingshu asked with a slight frown.

“Bai Momo explained, “When I came here just now, I found that first uncle and aunt locked your interstellar shuttle. I also heard from first aunt that this time, you have to marry or not, but you mustn’t run away.” ”

Bai Jingshu’s brows furrowed tightly when she heard this

“She didn’t expect her parents to be so dictatorial. In order to force her to agree, they actually restricted her travel. ”

What right did they have to do this!

“Furthermore, she had sneaked back this time. How did her parents find out? ”

Could it be that her parents were spying on her?

Bai Jingshu’s anger rose from the bottom of her heart. She wanted nothing more than to immediately go and argue with her parents.

“At that moment, Bai Mo held Bai Jingshu’s hand tightly. “Sis, don’t worry. I’ll help you. Come with me to my house.” ”

Bai Jingshu could only listen to Bai Mo and nodded. “Okay.”

Bai Mo’s lips curled into a sinister smile.

Bai Jingshu would never have dreamed that she was the one who had tipped them off.

She was the one who had told Zhou Ying.

“Moreover, she had even given Zhou Ying an idea. ”

Her parents had ordered the matchmaker to use force to suppress Bai Jingshu’s interstellar shuttle if she did not listen to them.

“Zhou Ying had always been a soft-hearted person. She had no idea how vicious Bai Mo’s intentions were. Moreover, Bai Mo and Bai Jingshu were cousins. It was unlikely that the two sisters would harm each other. ”

“Bai Mo continued, “Sister, uncle and Aunty have gone too far! Don’t worry, I’ll stand on your side!” ”

“For the first time in her life, Bai Jingshu felt the warmth of her younger sister. “Mo Mo, thank you.” ”
