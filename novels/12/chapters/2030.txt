Translator: 549690339

She wanted to unveil the sheepskin on ye Zao’s body in front of everyone and show the ugliest and most disgusting side of ye Zao in front of everyone.

As for regret?

She really regretted it now.

She regretted not cooperating with the six clan leaders earlier.

She regretted not killing ye Zao earlier.

“All these years, she had always taken into account the sisterhood between her and Ye Zhuo. She had never thought that she would be worse than a dog at ye Zhuo’s side. ”

“”Mom.”Fei Yu walked over from the side and continued, “Forget it. From the looks of Ye Lan, she is determined not to turn back.” ”

Grandma Fei’s face was full of tears.

She had already said everything that needed to be said.

“She had originally wanted to pull ye Lan back, but who knew that ye Lan would actually sink deeper and deeper. ”

“Now that things had come to this, she was helpless. ”

“Seeing that her mother had not said anything, Fei Yu continued, “Mother, do you think that Ye Lan is really a descendant of the Manxing Kingdom?” ”

“She saw that ye Lan was so confident, as if it was really true! ”

“”It’s fine if she’s daydreaming, but you’re also daydreaming!”Fei Fei’s grandmother wiped away her tears, then, she said, “The Manxing kingdom found the corpse of the full moon princess in the second year after she was lost! I don’t know if ye Lan’s eyes were covered by a ghost or not, but she actually believed such words!” ”

“If Ye Lan was really a descendant of the royal family, the Manxing Kingdom would have come over to acknowledge her as their relative with great fanfare long ago! ”

Would they have waited until now?

“Then why hasn’t the Manxing Kingdom announced this matter to the public?”Fei Yu continued to ask.

“Up until now, the official description of the princess was ‘missing...’ ”

Grandma Fei shook her head. “I’m not very clear about the specific situation either. It’s probably... to hide something.”

“The matters of the imperial family were very complicated to begin with. If one was not involved, who would be able to uncover the truth layer by layer! ”

“”Oh,”fei yu asked, “Mother, then you said just now that you’ve found ye Lan’s biological parents and want to bring her for an appraisal. is that true or are you lying to her?” ”

“”It’s true.”Grandma Fei nodded. “As early as three years ago, miss ye had already found ye Lan’s biological parents.” ”

“Hearing this, Fei Yu frowned strangely. “Since you’ve already found ye Lan’s parents, then why did Miss Ye Keep It a secret all this while?” ”

“”Ye Lan’s self-esteem has been strong ever since she was young. She has always insisted on finding her parents because she believes that her parents are not ordinary people. She was born extraordinary,”said Fei Yu, granny Fei paused for a moment, “If she finds out that her mother was forced to death by her father, that her father was an alcoholic, and that her sister was sold into the Little Red Mansion, how will she be able to bear this blow? “Moreover, if ye Lan’s father really finds her and is pestered by such a father, how will ye Lan continue to live her life in the future? “Therefore, I came up with an idea to have burning flame keep this matter a secret for now... ... .. ”

“Ye Lan’s father was called Zuo Shunguo. He was a complete drunkard and had been drinking for a long time. For the sake of alcohol, he had already sold off one of his daughters. ”

“If ye Lan and Zuo Shunguo were to acknowledge each other, ye Lan’s life would be over! ”

“Grandmother Fei pitied ye Lan’s background and did not want ye Lan to be pestered by such a father. Who would have thought that in the end, Ye Lan would instead hold a grudge against ye searing because of this matter. ”

“If she had known this would happen, she would not have come up with such an idea in the first place! ”

“Fei Yu frowned tightly, “So there were so many things in the middle! I say, why would miss ye Stop Ye Lan from finding her biological parents! Then what should we do now? Autumn flute was clearly setting up a trap for ye Lan. Ye Lan was also not clear-headed and actually really believed that she was a princess!” ”

“”Let her be.”Grandma Fei massaged her temples and recalled the words that ye Zao often said. She continued, “People have to pay for their own actions!” ”

“Fei Yu said, “Mom, is Miss Ye Not Dead?” ”

“”I don’t know,”Grandma Fei said. ”

“Fei Yu continued, “I know that you definitely know. You just don’t want to tell me! Seriously, you can’t even trust your own daughter!” ”

“It wasn’t that Granny Fei didn’t trust Fei Yu, but she knew Fei Yu too well. ” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Fei Yu had always been carefree since she was young, and she couldn’t hide anything in her heart. If she knew the secret of her family, it would become everyone’s secret in less than three days. ”

“”Go back, go back!”Granny Fei turned around and walked back. ”

“Fei Yu followed her footsteps, muttering along the way, “Mom, just tell me! I swear, I won’t tell a single word... am I still your biological daughter...” ”
