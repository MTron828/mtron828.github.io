“What do you think?”Ye Zao raised his eyebrows and asked back.

Cen Shaoqing’s hands trembled as he put the ring on her finger.

He had secretly measured the size of her ring finger.

“Therefore, the ring was just right for her. ”

Ye Zao stared at the ring on her ring finger.

“The design was quite nice, very much in line with her aesthetic standards. ”

It was just that the diamond was a little too big. It was a little too exaggerated to wear out.

It was not suitable for daily life.

“Moreover, it was inconvenient to do anything with such a big diamond ring. ”

“Do you like it?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“I like it.”Ye Zao nodded slightly. “It’s just that the diamond seems to be a little too big.”

“CEN Shaoqing said, “The bigger the diamond, the more valuable it is. The bigger it is, the more it can represent my love for you.” ”

Bang Bang Bang —

“With these words, countless fireworks rose around the small island. ”

“With the sound of an explosion, countless colorful smoke sprayed into the air! ”

“Although the light during the day had dimmed the color of the fireworks, CEN Shaoqing had modified the fireworks to dilute the color of the fireworks and deepen the color of the smoke. There were all kinds of colors in the smoke, and it was especially spectacular when combined together, it was majestic and very beautiful! ”

“Finally, the colorful smoke slowly converged in the air with the direction of the wind and finally formed a line of words: ”

“Ye Zhuo, I love you for Your Whole Life! ”

“Before the smoke dispersed, another round of explosions sounded in the air. ”

Ye Zhuo turned around and saw that it was the fireworks behind him.

The fireworks finally formed a line of words:

“Ye Zao, I love you so much! ”

Bang Bang Bang —

Another round of explosions.

“This time, the words were: ”

Three lives lucky to meet you.

Bang Bang Bang —

“This time, the words were: ”

“For the rest of my life, it will be you. ”

“Ye Zao stood in the Sea of roses with a smile on his face. He looked up at CEN Shaoqing and said, “Mr. Cen, I love you too.” ”

“After saying that, she tiptoed and gave him a light kiss on the corner of his lips. ”

“After skimming the surface of the water, she was just about to leave. ”

A pair of large hands pressed down on her waist.

The light kiss deepened.

They attacked the city and seized the lake.

“They went back and forth, not budging an inch. ”

“In the end, it was not just who had fallen to whom. ”

“Right at this moment, Bang Bang Bang — ”

The five-colored ribbons landed on the top of their heads and shoulders...

“Surprise!”

“”Congratulations, Great Burning!” ”

“”Congratulations, Miss Ye and Master Wu!” ”

“I wish all of you a long and lasting life!”

“We’ll grow old together!”

“Have a son soon!”

“...”

The sudden sound of blessings made ye burning open his eyes.

“The moment he opened his eyes, he saw the crowd surrounding them. ”

“There was an Lizi, Li Yueyue, Zhao Pingting... ”

“There was also Lin Ze, Bai Jingshu... ”

“There was also Yu Zifei, Tang Mi, Xu Gong... ”

There were many familiar smiling faces.

“Ye Zhuo was stunned for a moment and asked in surprise, “Why are all of you here?” ”

“Zhao pingting smiled and said, “Master Five asked us a month ago if we had time!” ”

That’s right. Cen Shaoqing had planned to propose a long time ago.

He wanted more people to witness this happiness together. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“”Yes, yes, yes.”Tang Mi’s eyes were red as she said, “Miss Ye, I’m really touched.” ”

“When unmarried men and women saw such a scene, their hearts would always be inexplicably touched. ”

They even had the urge to immediately find a boyfriend and get married.

“An lizi smiled and said, “Scorching, you must be happy!” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

Everyone was happy.

Only Lin Ze’s expression was a little complicated.

“Bai Jingshu lowered her voice and said, “Ah Ze, what’s wrong? Are you not feeling well?” ”

Lin Ze shook his head. “I’m fine.”

“Bai Jingshu continued, “Oh, I got it. After all, burning is our only sister. Are you afraid that burning won’t come home when she gets married?” ”

Lin Ze was an older brother after all. He was naturally unhappy to see his sister being taken advantage of by a pig.

“Lin Ze looked at ye burning in the crowd, “Did you know? “Actually, I didn’t really like any younger siblings in the past. In fact, I was very resistant to them. “It wasn’t until I saw Zao Zao for the first time that I felt an inexplicable sense of familiarity. Even though I had never seen Zao Zao before, I felt as if I had known her for a very long time. “At that time, I thought that if Zao Zao was my younger sister, I would definitely give her the best thing in the world!” ”

Bai Jingshu nodded. “I understand.”

She also liked ye Zao very much and had always treated him as her biological sister.

“After saying that, Bai Jingshu continued, “Ah Ze, don’t worry. Even if Luoluo gets married in the future, she will still be our closest and only sister.” ”

“Okay.”Lin Ze nodded.

Cen Shaoqing’s proposal this time was neither low-key nor low-key.
