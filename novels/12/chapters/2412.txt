“After all, the reason why they had become like this was all because of Mario. ”

“If it wasn’t for Mario’s obstinacy, how could l continent have become like this? ”

“Mario felt sorry for everyone and lowered his head, not daring to look at their faces. ”

“William helped Mario find a place to sit down and said, “Buddy, wait here for a moment. I’ll go find some food.” ”

Mario nodded without saying a word.

William turned around to look for food.

“Mario sat in a corner and buried his head in his knees, crying uncontrollably. ”

“At this moment, he no longer looked like a doctor. ”

“Not only was his dream of dominating the world shattered, but he had also caused the entire L continent to become a living hell. ”

He was a sinner!

“Other than regret, Mario didn’t know what to think. ”

But what was the use of regret?

“Let’s eat something first.”William walked over and handed Mario a piece of bread.

Mario looked up. “You eat. I’m not hungry.”

How could he still have the mood to eat now...

“William continued, “No matter what, you have to eat something. Only when you’re full will we have the confidence to destroy these strange beasts.” ”

“Can we really exterminate them?”Mario asked.

“”Yes.”William nodded his head firmly, “No matter what it is, it has its own weakness. These exotic beasts are no exception. Buddy, Pull Yourself Together First! I believe that we will definitely be able to restore L continent to its previous State!” ”

“Seeing William’s confidence, Mario suddenly felt a sense of confidence. “Really?” ”

“”Of course it’s true!”William continued, “Buddy, we’ve gone through so many ups and downs over the years. This little bit of difficulty in front of us is nothing at all!” ”

Mario fell silent for a moment.

Was this really just a little bit of difficulty?

“William continued, “Right, we can still contact Miss Ye! Dr. YC will definitely have a way!” ”

“When he heard Dr. YC, Mario’s eyes suddenly lit up. He grabbed William’s hand tightly and said, “That’s right! We can still look for Dr. YC!” ”

“Back then, it was ye Zhuo who had first discovered that there was a problem with these single-celled organisms. ”

“However, at that time, Mario had not taken those words to heart. ”

“Now that he thought about it, he was simply a retard back then! ”

“William’s expression darkened for a moment. “It’s a pity that our communication system has been destroyed by the exotic beasts. Otherwise, we could have contacted Dr. YC right now.” ”

“Fix it! Fix It immediately!”Mario immediately stood up from the ground.

He urgently needed ye Zhuo’s help.

William grabbed Mario’s arm. “Wait a moment.”

“What’s the matter?”Mario turned to look at William.

“William continued, “Let’s eat first! After eating, we’ll think of a way together! Isn’t there a saying in China? The body is the capital of the Revolution.” ”

Mario nodded and sat back down. He took the bread from William and began to eat it.

William was right. Only when he was full would he have the strength to do other things.

“After finishing a piece of bread, Mario stood up and said, “Let’s Go!” ”

“William continued, “I haven’t finished eating yet.” ”

Mario sat down again.

He was very anxious now.

“He was in a hurry to repair the machine. As long as the machine was repaired, there would be hope for the L continent. ”

“Ten minutes later, William finished a loaf of bread and the two of them set off to repair the communication equipment. ”

“The communication equipment was badly damaged, and it was almost impossible to see its original appearance. ”

William frowned slightly. “Can this really be fixed?”

“Mario couldn’t care about anything else. He had even forgotten about the pain in his legs. Rolling up his sleeves, he said, “Believe in yourself. It will definitely be fixed!” ”

William could only cooperate with Mario to repair the equipment.

“Actually, he knew very well that the communications equipment wouldn’t be fixed! ”

“However, at this moment, he had to find something to do. He couldn’t just sit around and wait for death! ”

Only when there was hope would people have the desire to live!

...

On the other side.

It was already the second day after Susan woke up.

“When she opened her eyes, she saw Joseph leaning against the bed and napping. ”

Why was Joseph Here?

Could it be that they had already returned to L continent?

Susan reached out and pushed Joseph. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Joseph immediately woke up from his sleep. When he saw that Susan had woken up, he said in surprise, “You’re Awake? How Do You Feel Now? Do you feel uncomfortable anywhere?” ”

“Susan pressed her temples and continued, “Where are we now? Have we arrived at L Continent?” ”

It was also at this moment that Susan realized that the surrounding environment was still so unfamiliar.
