Translator: 549690339

“Professor Yue said, “A phone call is nothing. Just wait. He will definitely come to me personally.” ”

“”I hope so.”Wan Sheng continued, “Have you told Little Tang about our Wan Hui?” ”

“Not yet.”Professor Yue shook his head.

“That’s good.”Wan Sheng heaved a sigh of relief. “I always feel that Little Tang’s child is a little unsuitable for our Wan Hui.”

Wan Hui was the only son of Wan Sheng and professor Yue.

He was 28 years old and unmarried.

“Therefore, the couple had always wanted to set up Wan Hui and Tang Xue. ”

“However, after this incident, Wan Sheng felt that it wouldn’t be a good thing if the two of them really became a couple. ”

“Professor Yue was a stubborn person. Once he got Tang Xue Back, he wouldn’t be able to live a good life with Professor Yue. ”

“”You don’t like Xiaoxue. Xiaoxue doesn’t like our Xiao Hui!”Professor Yue continued, “Do you know how many people in the base have a crush on Xiaoxue?” ”

Even a talent like Wang Lei liked Tang Xue. This was enough to prove Tang Xue’s charm.

Wan Sheng smiled. “It’s not that I don’t like her. I just think it’s a little inappropriate. Wan Hui’s personality is too quiet.”

Professor Yue rolled his eyes at Wan Sheng and didn’t say anything.

On the other side.

“Professor Ma stayed in his office the whole night. His eyes were red from staying up all night, but he still couldn’t crack the password on the chip. ”

“Seeing that the agreed delivery date with Country L was about to arrive, he couldn’t go on like this. ”

Professor Ma narrowed his eyes.

“After thinking for a while, professor Ma changed to another method to crack the password. ”

“An hour later, it still ended in failure. ”

“After learning that Professor Ma didn’t go back for the whole night to crack the password, Tang Ruye woke up early and specially brought breakfast for Professor Ma. “Professor Ma, you didn’t go back for the whole night?” ”

Professor ma nodded. “It seems that I’m really old! Why Can’t I crack this password!”

“Tang Ruye handed the food to Professor Ma. “Please eat something first, I’ll take a look.” ”

Professor Ma put the food aside and sighed. “How can I be in the mood to eat if the password hasn’t been cracked?”

“”People are made of iron and iron. You’ve been busy all night. You should at least eat something.”Tang ruye continued, “Give me a chance too. It’s said that those who are in the middle of the matter are clueless. Maybe I’ll crack it!” ”

“Professor ma smiled and said, “Then come and try it.” ”

Tang Ruye sat on Professor Ma’s chair.

“On the computer, a webpage showing the password cracking was displayed. ”

Tang Ruye tried to enter a line of code.

“Very soon, the password was cracked. However, before she could be happy, she was faced with a second question. ”

She saw that the password cracked on the screen was quickly covered with a new layer of password.

Tang ruye frowned slightly. “What’s going on?”

“Professor Ma took a bite of the bun and said, “I’ve been doing this for a whole night!” ”

“Who do you think set this password?”Tang Ruye asked.

“Who else could it be? It must be the previous leader of this research room. I heard that his surname is Yue.”

“Tang ruye continued, “Someone came to look for that Professor Yue yesterday.” ”

“Is that so?” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“”Yes.”Tang ruye nodded, “Professor Ma, do you think we should look for this professor Yue? Since she set the password, she must know what the real password is. After all, the delivery date with Country L is coming up soon.”No matter what.., they couldn’t delay the delivery date. ”

“”Let’s Wait a little longer.”Professor Ma took a sip of soy milk. “I just took over Area B, and I encountered such a difficult problem. I have to ask Professor Yue. It Won’t sound good if it gets out.” ”

“Okay.”Tang ruye nodded.

“In the blink of an eye, another day had passed. ”

“However, professor Ma still couldn’t crack the password. In desperation, professor Ma had no choice but to invite his good friend. ”

“His good friend had been engaged in scientific research for many years. Currently, he was retired at home. ”

“After receiving a call from Professor Ma, his good friend rushed over. However, after sitting on the chair and studying for a long time, he still couldn’t figure out anything. ”

“”Old Lian, how is it?” ”

“Lian Jianbang shook his head. “The other party is deliberately giving you a difficult problem! Other than the person who set the password, no one else can break it!” ”

“Professor ma frowned. “Old Lian, then you mean that I have to ask the person who set the password?” ”

“Yes.”Lian Jianbang nodded.

Professor ma sighed. “Is there really no other way?”

“There is a way.”Lian Jianbang said.

“What Way?”Professor Ma asked impatiently.
