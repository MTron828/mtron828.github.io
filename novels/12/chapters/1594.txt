“Chapter 1595: 340: returning to her previous life, so the cause and effect was for her! 4”

“When she thought of ye Zao, Mu Yourong’s eyes were filled with hatred. ”

Hers.

They were all hers.

Everything that ye Zao had now was hers!

“If ye Zao had not used the system to snatch her things, she would not have fallen to this state. ”

“When Mu Yourong’s system was still around, it had taught her how to snatch away the methods of others who had the system. ”

Just wait.

“Not only did she want ye Zao to die, she also wanted to take away ye Zao’s system and rebuild a prosperous life! ”

“This time, she would not let anyone plot against her! ”

Mu Yourong narrowed her eyes.

“”Sister Rong, come with me!” ”

“At this moment, a person suddenly rushed out from the side, grabbed Mu Yourong’s hand and pulled her inside. ”

“Mu Yourong looked around, and after confirming that there were no problems, she immediately followed in. ”

“Although this was just an inconspicuous alley, there was a different world inside. ”

“After opening the door to the alley, there was a large courtyard. ”

There was an underground trading hall hidden in the courtyard.

Mu Yourong followed them into the office.

“That person took off his sunglasses and turned to look at Mu Yourong. “Sister Rong, you weren’t discovered along the way, right?” ”

“Mu Yourong shook her head. “Don’t worry, I wasn’t discovered.” ”

“That’s good. You must have been hungry along the way. I’ll go get something for you to eat.”

“”I’m not hungry.”Mu Yourong sat down. “Little Wang, what did you do with the things I asked you to do?” ”

“Little Wang also sat down and continued, “Sister Rong, the person you asked me to investigate is now the eldest daughter of the Lin family. If you want to get close to her, there’s only one way.” ”𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Xiaowang and Mu Yourong had been cellmates.

“Mu Yourong could tell that Xiaowang was not some simple criminal, so she used methods to gain Xiaowang’s trust. ”

“Sure enough, after escaping from prison, Xiaowang became her right-hand man! ”

“What did you say?”Mu Yourong’s eyes were filled with disbelief. “Whose eldest daughter is she?”

“”The Lin family,”Xiaowang said. “Her father is Lin Jincheng.” ”

Lin Jincheng.

Mu Yourong naturally knew who Lin Jincheng was.

How could this be.

How could ye Zhuo possibly be Lin Jincheng’s child.

How did she do it?

The system.

Ye Zhuo had the system.

“Ye Zhuo used the system to find out his background, so he resolutely left the Mu family and climbed up another branch. ”

No!

The position of the Lin family’s eldest daughter should be hers.

“After all, she was the child that ye Shu raised single-handedly. ”

What was ye Zao?

Ye Zao was just a slut who only knew how to occupy the magpie’s nest.

“Mu Yourong was very regretful now, regretting that she shouldn’t have left ye Shu, shouldn’t have left the ye family. ”

“If she hadn’t left the ye family, then the position of the eldest daughter of the Lin family would have been hers! ”

“At this moment, Mu Yourong suddenly came to a realization. ”

She finally understood why ye Zao had left the Mu family at that time!

It turned out that ye Zao had long known that she was a child of the Lin family.

No wonder!

No wonder!

Only she was foolishly kept in the dark and did not know that her identity had been stolen.

“Compared to the Lin family, what was the Mu Family? ”

The Mu family could not even compare to the Lin family’s Pinky!

Ye Zao was truly scheming!

Truly Shameless!

How could there be such a shameless person like ye Zao in this world?

Mu Yourong was so angry that her entire body was trembling. She wanted nothing more than to directly tear ye Zao into pieces.

Just wait.

She had to take back both the Lin family’s eldest daughter and fifth Cen’s fiancée.

She had to let ye Zao know that he had to pay a price for snatching other people’s things!

“Seeing that Mu Yourong did not speak for a long time and still looked so pale, little wang asked worriedly, “Sister Rong, Are You Alright?” ”

“”I’m fine.”Mu Yourong collected her thoughts and continued, “What method did you tell me to get close to ye Zao?” ”

“Little Wang took out a recruitment notice. “The Lin family is currently lacking three maids to clean up. Sister Rong, if you don’t have any problems, I can arrange for you to enter the Lin family.” ”

Maid?

Let Her Be Ye Zhuo’s maid?

On what basis?

“But now, other than being a maid, there seemed to be no other choice. ”

“If she couldn’t bear it, she would mess up the big plan. ”

“In order to take back everything that belonged to her, she could bear it! ”

“After a moment, Mu yourong nodded and said, “Alright, that’s what we’ll do. Xiao Wang, I’ll have to trouble you!” ”

“Xiao Wang smiled and said, “Miss Mu, look at what you’re saying. You took care of me inside. If it wasn’t for you, my legs would have been crippled. I should be the one thanking you properly!” ”

“”No matter what, I still have to thank you.”Mu Yourong held Xiao Wang’s hand. “Xiao Wang, don’t worry. If anything happens, I will absolutely not implicate you!” ”
