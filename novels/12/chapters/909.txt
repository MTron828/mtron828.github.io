“Cen Yuyan bit her lip. “Second sister, don’t worry. I Won’t interact with song Chenyu ever again! I’ll Pretend I don’t know this person from now on!””

Cen Yueya looked at Cen Yuyan in surprise and reached out to touch her forehead. “You have a fever?”

“No Fever.”Cen Yuyan took Cen Yueya’s hand away. “I just saw her face clearly all of a sudden! I never knew she was that kind of person!”

Cen Yuyan still couldn’t help but cry when she said this.

She was really sad.

“She had always treated song Chenyu as her best sister, and even took two slaps from Cen Shaoqing for Song Chenyu.”

But what about Song Chenyu?

Song Chenyu played her like a fool!

What she really got in return was a fool.

“Perhaps in song Chenyu’s eyes, she was a fool.”

“When she thought of this, Cen Yuyan’s eyes were filled with ridicule.”

“Although Cen Yuyan was not a smart person and sometimes liked to meddle in other people’s business, this did not mean that she was a girl who loved to cry.”

“When she saw Cen Yuyan Cry, Cen Yueya jumped in fright and hurriedly said, “What’s wrong? Who bullied you?””

“Cen Yuyan just happened to have a stomach full of grievances to say. She hugged CEN Yueya and said, “Second sister, Song Chenyu lied to me! She played me like a fool...””

“”What’s going on? Tell second sister. When the time comes, second sister will help you vent your anger.””

Cen Yuyan hugged Cen Yueya and sobbed as she told her what happened.

“Hearing this, Cen Yueya frowned tightly, “Grandma has long reminded you that song Chenyu is a scheming person. In the entertainment industry, which one of them doesn’t know how to Act? Learning from your mistakes is actually a good thing for you!””

“Cen Yuyan cried until she was out of breath. “I just feel very uncomfortable. I treated her so well, but she treated me like this! She clearly knew Lu Xiu’s intentions, yet she still incited me to confess to Lu Xiu...””

“”Okay, okay, Don’t cry anymore. As long as you see clearly what kind of person she is,”cen yuaya continued, “In the future, be more careful when you make friends. You’re already in your thirties this year, why are you acting like a child? “You can’t even differentiate between good and bad. If you had listened to Grandma’s words earlier, you wouldn’t have ended up like this!””

Cen Yuyan was also very regretful.

She regretted not listening to Old Madam Cen’s words.

“Cen Yueya patted Cen Yuyan’s shoulder and continued, “Don’t you already have a new boyfriend now? Oh right, when are you going to bring her back for us to see?””

Cen Yuyan’s mood eased up a lot when Zhou Rui was mentioned.

At least she still had love after losing her friendship.

“”Let’s Wait a little longer,”Cen Yuyan continued.”

“CEN Yueya said, “You’re almost forty years old. Bring him back as soon as you can. Don’t let mom and Grandma Worry About You every day.””

“Okay.”Cen Yuyan nodded.

“Cen Yueya took a tissue to wipe Cen Yuyan’s eyes and continued, “You want to rest for a while. I’ll go out and entertain the guests. Your second brother-in-law might not be able to handle it by himself.””

“”Alright, second sister, you can go.””

“Don’t be sad.”

On the other side.

Tian Tian ran to ye Zao’s side. “Little aunt!”

“Tian Tian.”

“Tian Tian continued, “Little aunt, I’ve completed my mission!””

“Tian Tian is so awesome!”Ye Zao patted Tian Tian’s little head.

“”Little aunt, I’m so awesome. Are you really not considering rewarding me?””

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Then what reward do you want?””

“Tian Tian tilted her head and thought for a while, “I want a robot that can talk, a small one that can be put in your pocket, but not that stupid robot. I want the smartest robot in the universe like Xiao Bai!””

“Okay.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“Really?”Tian Tian looked up in surprise.

“Of course it’s true.”

“”Long live little aunt!”Tian tian cheered, “Little aunt, you are simply the most powerful little aunt in the universe. All the little aunts in our class combined are not as powerful as you!””

“Ye Zao lowered his head and pinched Tian Tian’s face, “Have you gained weight recently?””

“”No.”Tian Tian shook her head and reached out to hug ye Zao’s waist, “Little aunt, your body smells so good, much better than my mother’s!””

“Tiantian.”

A deep voice suddenly appeared in the air.

“Tiantian turned around and saw Cen Shaoqing standing behind her. His thin lips were tightly pursed, and his facial features seemed to be covered with an impenetrable layer of ice.”

“”Uncle, uncle.”” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Such an uncle seemed a little scary.

Tiantian was so scared that she swallowed her saliva.
