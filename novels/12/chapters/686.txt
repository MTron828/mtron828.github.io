“Song Chenyu nodded very seriously. “Really! Yuyan, don’t worry about those problems that come out of nowhere anymore!” ”

“Song Chenyu had grown up with Lu Xiu since young. When she heard song Chenyu’s words, Cen Yuyan felt much more at ease. ”

“She believed that with song Chenyu’s help, she would definitely be able to woo Lu Xiu. ”

“Soon, the two of them walked to Lu Xiu’s side. ”

Lu Xiu and another young man were fiddling with the roasting tray.

“Song Chenyu said softly, “Lu Xiu, do you mind if Yuyan and I join you?” ”

“Before Lu Xiu could say anything, the young man beside him said, “Of course I don’t mind. We’re more than happy to welcome you!” ”

“Of the two of them, one was the best actress in the entertainment industry, and the other was the fourth daughter of the Cen family. No matter which one they were, they were unattainable. Now that they took the initiative to come over, he naturally would not reject them. ”

“Song Chenyu smiled and said, “Then I’ll be in charge of roasting. The three of you will be in charge of eating.” ”

“The young man was also a very discerning person. He continued, “Miss Song, I’ll Be Your Assistant. Otherwise, you definitely won’t be able to handle it by yourself.” ”

“”Alright, then I’ll have to trouble you.” ”

“Thus, the scene changed to Song Chenyu and the young man sitting there roasting while Cen Yuyan and Lu Xiu sat opposite each other eating. ”

“Although Cen Yuyan was already thirty-four years old, she was still as shy as a young girl when facing Lu Xiu and paid attention to the way she ate. ”

“Song Chenyu placed a skewer of roasted golden needle mushrooms on the plate and said with a smile, “Lu Xiu, why are you acting like a quiet gourd? Aren’t you going to talk to Yuyan?” ”

Lu Xiu rubbed his nose but didn’t say anything.

“Song Chenyu continued, “Oh right, Yuyan, aren’t you quite interested in AI technology? It just so happens that Lu Xiu is quite good at this convenience. If there’s anything you don’t understand, you can ask Lu Xiu more.” ”

“Hearing this, Cen Yuyan raised her head to look at Lu Xiu. “That Mr. Lu, can I really ask you?” ”

Lu Xiu knew what song Chenyu meant. Song Chenyu was nothing more than trying to set him up with Cen Yuyan.

But he had no feelings for Cen Yuyan at all.

The person he liked had never been Cen Yuyan.

“All these years, he had been waiting for Song Chenyu... ”

“However, Cen Yuyan was song Chenyu’s good friend after all. No matter what, she could not refute song Chenyu’s good intentions. Thinking of this, Lu Xiu raised his head and looked at Cen Yuyan. “Yes, if you have any questions, Miss CEN can ask.” ”

“Cen Yuyan was overjoyed in her heart, and her gratitude towards song Chenyu deepened. ”

“If it were not for song Chenyu, she probably would not have had the chance to sit at the same table as Lu Xiu. But now, not only could she sit at the same table as Lu Xiu, but she could also discuss problems with Lu Xiu. ”

“Cen Yuyan asked Lu Xiu many questions in a row. Finally, she said, “Mr. Lu, thank you for being so attentive in answering so many questions for me. Let’s have a meal together when you have the time? Take it as me thanking you.” ”

“Under the current circumstances, Lu Xiu could only nod his head and agree. ”

“He was afraid that if he rejected, song Chenyu would be disappointed. ”

He didn’t want to see song Chenyu disappointed.

“Seeing Lu Xiu nod, Cen Yuyan was very excited. ”

“Song Chenyu was roasting the chicken wings in his hand, and his gaze turned to ye Zao. ”

“The two of them sat in front of the barbecue stove, roasting and eating. ”

“To be more precise, Cen Shaoqing was roasting and Ye Zao was eating. ”

Cen Shaoqing was roasting?

Song Chenyu frowned.

Was she really not mistaken?

Wasn’t it supposed to be ye Zao roasting and Cen Shaoqing Eating?

Was Ye Zao...

Being spoiled and arrogant?

Taking advantage of Cen Shaoqing’s love for her and doing whatever he wanted?

Song Chenyu had become famous early on and had experienced many things.

She knew very well that there was no lasting love in this world.

“Especially for a man like Cen Shaoqing, his love had no expiration date. ”

“As long as ye Zao had a brain, he would not be spoiled and arrogant like this. ”

She should think of a way to ingratiate herself with Cen Shaoqing and have a common language with CEN Shaoqing.

It seemed that the relationship between the two would not last long.

Song Chenyu curled the corner of her lips and looked away.

“Although Cen Shaoqing had never barbecued before, under ye Zao’s influence, his skills were getting better and better. From the first skewer’s pitch black to the third skewer’s golden yellow on both sides, it took less than ten minutes. ”

“Ye Zao took the baked potato chips that Cen Shaoqing handed over and teased, “Mr. Cen’s cooking skills are getting better! You can even open a barbecue shop now.” ”

“”Thank you, leader.” ”

“Ye Zao was overjoyed. He took a bite of the potato chips. They were crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. After biting open, the potatoes inside were soft and sticky. They combined the fragrance of chili powder and cumin powder, and the taste was very good. ”
