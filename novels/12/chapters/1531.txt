Young.

Too Young.

Dr. Cara looked at her with a complicated expression.

The most famous Doctor of Science in the world was an Indian named elbu.

“Elbu became famous at the age of 25. At the age of 30, he became the youngest Doctor of Science in the history of scientific research! ”

“After that, no one could surpass elbu. ”

“After all, the child now had not graduated from a doctor at the age of 30! ”

The girl in front of him was so young that Dr. Cara even suspected that there was something wrong with the previous science and technology competition.

The people behind Cara were also a little surprised.

“Firstly, they did not expect ye Zao to be so young. Secondly, they did not expect ye Zao to really dare to come. ”

Ye Zao did not appear for a long time. They thought that ye Zao was going to chicken out.

They did not expect ye Zao to come.

“While they were thinking, the girl walked in front of the crowd. She was graceful and elegant. Her movements were elegant and pleasing to the eyes. ”

“”Hello, Dr. Cara. I am YC.”Ye Zao took the initiative to reach out his hand to Dr. Cara. ”

“Dr. Cara finally reacted and continued, “I am Cara. This is Dr. Tina and Dr. Orvis. These two are the office staff of the International Notary Office.” ”

“Hello.”

The others nodded to ye Zao with a smile.

“Dr. Cara looked at ye Zao and continued, “Dr. YC, you’re late. We thought you were going to chicken out.” ”

“”A man of his word is hard to keep. Since it’s already an agreement, why would I chicken out? You’re worrying too much!”Ye Zao smiled faintly and continued, “Besides, we Chinese are the most honest people.” ”

“Although the people standing in front of her were all famous technology bigwigs from various countries, ye Zao did not have the slightest cowardice on his face. Instead, he exuded a sense of confidence from his bones, and his back was very straight. It even gave Kara the illusion that the person in front of her was not a young girl at all, but an elder who had gone through a thousand sails! ”

“Cara had seen many people in her life, but this was the first time she had seen someone like ye Zao. ”

She was too calm and too confident. It was hard to believe that she was just a young lady.

Dr. Cara smiled and nodded. “Dr. YC is right.”

“Ye Zao walked to the conference table, displaying the demeanor of a big country. “Everyone, please take a seat. I believe that everyone has already seen the new agreement. If you feel that there is no problem, you can just sign it.” ”

Dr. Cara and the others looked at each other before sitting down on both sides of the conference table.

“”We’ve already signed the agreement.”Dr. Cara handed the agreement to ye Zhuo. “Now, we’re just waiting for your signature.” ”

Ye Zhuo took the agreement. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The gambling agreement was in triplicate.

“She kept one copy. Dr. Cara and the other doctors from five other countries kept one copy. Then, the international notary office kept one copy. ”

“Ye Zhuo read ten lines at a glance. After confirming that there were no problems, he signed all three agreements and handed the agreement to Dr. Cara. ”

“Dr. Cara looked at the signature in black and white, and a faint smile appeared on the corner of his mouth. ”

He could finally put down his heart that had been waiting for so long.

“Next, he just had to wait for the two-year agreement! ”

“Two years later, the management rights of the CEN’s scientific research base in China would belong to them! ”

“Two staff members of the International Notary Office stood up, “Dr. YC, in order to avoid conflicts and disputes in the future, we may need you to cooperate with us to make a video recording. If you have no objections, sign this document.”After saying that, the staff member handed a document to Ye Zhuo. ”

“The cross-border betting agreement was not a small matter. It had to be strict and rigorous. If ye Zhuo were to go back on her word after two years, with this evidence, would she still have any room for regret? Doing so was equivalent to cutting off all of ye Zao’s options of retreat! She had no room for retreat! ”

Ye Zao took the document and signed his name on it.

The staff took the camera and started recording.

A total of ten minutes of recording.

“After recording, the entire signing process was completed. ”

“Ye Zao kept the agreement and continued, “Dr. Cara, is this your first time in China?” ”

“Professor Cara shook his head and said with a smile, “I came here once thirty years ago. I was only ten years old at that time.”In the blink of an eye, he was already forty years old! ”

“Ye Zhuo nodded slightly and maintained a polite smile on his face, then, he said, “Thirty Years is neither short nor long. I don’t know if professor Cara has noticed, but in just thirty years, there has been a qualitative change in China. “How about this? I’ll be the host. I’ll take you around the capital and try some of the local delicacies of China.” ”
