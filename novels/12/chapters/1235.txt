“Chapter 1236: 258: Great Scorch strikes, blood beats Zhao Xueyin! 5”

Translator: 549690339

“At this moment, ye Zao couldn’t believe his eyes. ”

Was the ‘Beep Beep’sound coming from the bloody thing on the ground?

“”Great, great scorch...”little white looked at ye Zao and said with difficulty, “This, this is a silly cat...” ”

“At the end, Whitey burst into tears. ” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Although the robot did not cry, its feelings were real. ”

“After spending so much time with brother Meow, Whitey had long treated brother Meow as its silly son. ”

“Now that brother Meow was gone, and in this way, he was gone. ”

Whitey’s feelings at this moment could not be expressed in words.

“”What nonsense are you talking about!”Zhao Xueyin’s voice sounded a little panicked, “That’s just an imitation meat, not your cat!” ”

“”It’s a silly cat! That’s a silly cat! The silly cat has a chip that can prove its identity!”Little White pointed at Zhao Xueyin and said, “You Evil Woman! You killed the silly cat!” ”

“”You dare to touch my things,”ye Zhuo’s gaze was very cold, “Zhao Xueyin, who gave you the courage?” ”

Even though he was already prepared that Zhao Xueyin was the one who captured brother Meow.

Ye Zao did not expect that Zhao Xueyin’s methods would be so cruel.

“From the looks of it, brother Meow’s fur should have been ripped off alive. ”

It was hard to imagine what kind of pain the little cat had suffered at that time.

It must have been in despair!

“After being in this world for so long, this was the first time ye Zao knew that the human heart could be so vicious to such an extent. ”

“Now that things had developed to this point, Zhao Xueyin did not plan to pretend anymore. ”

“Since she dared to kill the cat, she was prepared to face ye Zao. ”

“”That’s right, that damned cat was killed by me! What’s wrong? Isn’t it just a cat? If you have the ability, kill me too!” ”

Would Ye Zao Dare?

She did not dare!

“In this world, there was only a death penalty for killing people, but there was no such thing as a death penalty for killing a cat. ”

“Thinking of this, Zhao Xueyin was extremely happy. She continued, “Ye Zao, if you have the ability, then kill me! Come On!” ”

Zhao Xueyin was not afraid at all.

Because...

Her future had been destroyed by Ye Zao.

“She could not see the light, nor could she see the light. ”

“If ye Zao really made a move, then ye Zao would also have to bear legal responsibility! ”

If he really took a human life...

Then ye Zao’s fate would definitely be a thousand times worse than hers!

“The more Zhao Xueyin thought about it, the happier she became. She continued to provoke ye Zao, “Ye Zao, do you know how miserable that damn cat died?” ”

“”Zhao Xueyin, do you really think that I don’t dare to touch you?”Ye Zao’s voice was a little low, “I have a hundred ways to make you disappear from this world!” ”

“When she heard the last sentence, Zhao Xueyin’s heart trembled and her body was drenched in cold sweat. ”

Could it be that ye Zhuo really dared to make a move?

No!

Impossible.

It was only the death of a cat. Ye Zhuo could not do anything to her.

Zhao Xueyin comforted herself in her heart.

“After a moment, ye Zhuo let go of Zhao Xueyin and picked up a tissue to wipe his hands. He looked back at Little White. “Bring the silly cat with you. Let’s go.” ”

Little White used the paper box to carry brother Meow away.

“Looking at Ye Zao’s back, Zhao Xueyin curled her lips. “Ye Zao, is that all you’ve Got?” ”

She had thought that ye Zao was very capable!

“In the end, he still did not dare to touch a single hair on her head? ”

Could it be that ye Zao wanted to revoke her position?

“Thinking of this, Zhao Xueyin narrowed her eyes. ”

Revoke her position because of a cat?

Impossible!

Zhao Xueyin snorted coldly.

“Just wait, this was just the beginning. ”

“From a few days later, she would make ye Zhuo pay back what he owed her, bit by bit! ”

Xiao Baibai held brother Meow in its arms and remained silent the entire way. All of its emotions were written on its face.

“An employee passed by on the way and asked curiously, “Xiao Baibai, have you found brother Meow?” ”

Xiao Baibai lowered its head and did not speak.

“Xiao Baibai was not usually like this. For a moment, everyone was very curious about what had happened. ”

“Only when they followed ye Zhuo back to the office did Xiao Baibai speak, “Da Zao, the silly cat died so tragically... are we just going to let it go like this...” ”

“There was no expression on ye Zhuo’s face. “Don’t worry, I won’t let the silly cat die in vain.” ”

“Previously, she did not touch Zhao Xueyin because Zhao Xueyin had not crossed her bottom line. ”

This time.

She would make Zhao Xueyin regret it beyond measure.

Ye Zhuo picked up a pen on the table.

PA!

“The next second, the pen was broken. ”

“Little White hugged the paper box and cried as it said, “Silly cat, why are you so silly? Don’t you know how to run when you see that evil woman, Zhao Xueyin?” ”
