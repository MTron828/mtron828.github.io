“Chapter 1658: 348: Miss Ye’s anger is very scary, late stage of wife control! 1”

Translator: 549690339

Yu Zifei’s current glory was all because of him.

He was the one who personally ruined his future.

“Old Nie looked down on ye Zhuo from the beginning, thinking that ye Zhuo was young and bragging. Because he was also in the scientific research field, he knew that the current technology of mankind could not possibly reach the speed of light! The speed of light was a myth to mankind. From the beginning to the end, he never thought that a little girl in her early 20s could really build an aircraft carrier that surpassed the speed of light and successfully landed on Neptune, turning the myth into reality. ”

He should not have looked down on ye Zhuo.

And he should not have left the aircraft carrier project team.

Old Nie now wished he could beat that stupid old nie to death.

He only hated that there was no medicine for regret in this world.

“At this moment, his colleague, Old Zhou, seemed to have thought of something and continued, “Oh right, nie gong, I remember that Big C area’s Yu Zifei, team leader Yu, should be your disciple, right?” ”

“Old Nie was stunned for a moment, then nodded. “Yes.” ”

“”Then you can go look for your disciple! Team leader Yu is now a very popular person in front of Miss Ye! As long as he speaks, Miss Ye will definitely be able to let you return to Big C area.” ”

Old Nie could not put on an expression when he heard this.

Let him look for Yu Zifei?

How could he pull down his face like this.

“After saying this, old Zhou continued, “I have no way out. If you have a way out, then hurry up and go! You have to know that many people want to enter the greater C area now. If you go late, you won’t have the chance!” ”

Old Nie sighed. There was some bitterness that he could not say.

“He had previously treated Yu Zifei so badly, and now he was asking him to beg Yu Zifei? ”

Wasn’t this humiliating himself?

“Old Zhou patted old Nie’s shoulder, he said earnestly, “Nie gong, I know that you can’t bring yourself to lose face, but how much is face worth? Team leader Yu is your disciple after all. He has to give you face no matter what! Think about it carefully. I’ll go inside and take a look! Now that the laboratory has been disbanded, we still don’t know how the base will arrange things for us! Anyway, if I Were you, I would definitely look for team leader Yu! It’s a pity that I don’t have a good disciple like you!” ”

“After saying that, his colleague walked in. ”

Old Nie looked at his colleague’s back and had a very complicated expression on his face.

Could it be that he really had to be thick-skinned to look for Yu Zifei?

“At this moment, another colleague walked out from inside. ”

“Old Nie hurriedly went up to welcome him. “Xiao Wang, how is it? What arrangements have been made for us here at the base?” ”

“Xiao Wang was also feeling extremely uncomfortable, he then said, “What other arrangements can there be? Almost all of us have come from Miss Ye’s side! In any case, I’ve been assigned to do odd jobs! If I had known this would happen, I wouldn’t have left Big C district even if I died! “This is all Miss Tang’s fault. If it wasn’t for her, how could I have left Big C District!” ”

Little Wang was also very regretful. He regretted that he didn’t have a firm stand and had been deceived by Tang Xue’s flowery words.

“If he had stayed in Big C district, he would still be a glorious existence now. It was all his fault that he had become like this! ”

Xiaowang wished he could slap himself twice!

“Doing odd jobs?”Old Nie’s face was full of disbelief.

Xiaowang was also a technician in the Tang family’s laboratory. How could he have been assigned to do odd jobs?

“”Yes! Do you think you will give us good jobs?”Xiaowang continued, “I will report to Area B first. I Won’t talk to you anymore.” ”

Old Nie nodded. He didn’t have time to say anything else and walked inside.

There was a notice on the wall of the department.

The notice clearly indicated the future direction of everyone in the department.

Old Nie quickly found his name.

He was actually arranged to be in the warehouse.

Warehouse manager?

“Seeing this, old Nie’s face turned pale. ”

He was a senior researcher after all. How could he be arranged to be in the warehouse!

No.

He could not manage the warehouse.

The other people in the department also looked very upset and dejected.

“But now, other than accepting it, what else could they do? ”

Who asked them to follow the wrong person back then!

There was no medicine for regret in this world.

Looking at the notice on the wall. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Old Nie did not want to resign himself to fate.

He simply could not accept such a difference!

Yu Zifei.

He had to find Yu Zifei right away.

“Yu Zifei followed ye Zhuo to Neptune and occupied an important position on ye Zhuo’s side. As long as Yu Zifei spoke, Ye Zhuo would definitely agree to it. ”

Old Zhou was right. How much was face worth?
