“Here.”

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “I’ll wait for you at the West Gate.””

“”Alright, I’ll be right there.””

“After hanging up, Ye Zhuo walked towards the west gate.”

“Just as he reached the west gate, he saw Cen Shaoqing, dressed in a plain robe, leaning against the car door with a string of bright red Buddhist beads in his hand.”

“His facial features were outstanding, and his figure was slender. He was leaning against the car door. It was originally a very casual action, but it gave off an unattainable domineering aura. It was hard to imagine how many streets he would surpass the young male stars.”

“The students who passed by all looked at him and whispered among themselves. Some of the girls wanted to go forward and ask for wechat, but that person’s aura was too strong. They did not have the courage to go over at all.”

“What kind of woman do you think is worthy of such a top-notch man?” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“”Of course, only a celestial immortal is worthy of him!””

“That’s not possible. I think he must be waiting for the girls in our school!”

“How do you know it’s a girl? What if he’s waiting for his good brother?”

“At this moment, a tall and slender figure walked over. He had an extraordinary temperament, and his eyes were as clear as a painting.”

The crowd instantly fell silent.

“At first, everyone was wondering what kind of celestial immortal would be worthy of such a top-notch man?”

It was only until ye Zao’s appearance that everyone was convinced.

“The two of them stood together. One was handsome, and the other was beautiful. They were evenly matched. Even if they didn’t do anything, it was enough to shock everyone.”

Ye Zao walked directly to Cen Shaoqing. “When did you arrive?”

“”I just arrived.”Cen Shaoqing held ye Zhuo’s hand and bent down slightly, leaning his head on ye Zhuo’s shoulder.”

“What’s Wrong?”

“”I’m a little tired.”Cen Shaoqing reached out and wrapped his arm around her waist, pulling her into his embrace. “Don’t move, let me carry you for a while.””

“There was a refreshing orchid-like scent on her body, and it smelled very comfortable. It could make people instantly put down all their fatigue. Cen Shaoqing took a deep breath.”

“About a minute later, Cen Shaoqing let go of her. “Shall We Go Eat First?””

“Sure.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

Cen Shaoqing went to the other side and opened the car door for ye Zhuo.

Ye Zhuo got into the car.

“In the blink of an eye, the luxury car disappeared at the school gate, raising a cloud of dust.”

“DAMN! was that the school Belle just now?”

“I think so!”

“”So, that man is the boyfriend of the school Belle? He’s a perfect match!””

“”Yeah, yeah! I also feel that they’re a good match!””

“Feng Xianxian walked out of the door. When she saw this scene, she was so jealous that her facial features were twisted.”

On what basis?

On what basis did ye Zao have?

Cen Shaoqing was hers!

She should be the one who was jealous!

“If ye Zao had not interfered, Cen Shaoqing would be her boyfriend now!”

Ye Zao!

It was all ye Zao’s fault!

Ye Zao was a slut!

“Just like her mother, he was a shameless person who specialized in snatching other people’s boyfriends!”

After a long while.

Feng Xianxian finally reacted and turned around to leave.

“On the other side, the luxury car stopped in front of a member-only restaurant.”

“Cen Shaoqing was a regular customer here. The manager respectfully welcomed the two of them in. As they walked, he sized up ye Zao who was beside Cen Shaoqing.”

He was very shocked.

“He had known Cen Shaoqing for a long time, but he had never seen Cen Shaoqing bring a female companion here.”

This was the first time.

Could this girl be a relative of CEN fifth master’s Family?

“The two came to the private room and sat down. The manager suppressed the doubt in his heart and continued, “Fifth master, are we still serving the dishes according to the old rules?”Because Cen Shaoqing was a vegetarian.., therefore, the head chef of the restaurant had specially made a vegetarian dish for Cen Shaoqing.”

Cen Shaoqing placed the Buddha beads on the table and looked up at Ye Zhuo. “What do you want to eat?”

Ye Zhuo turned to look at the manager. “What are the chef’s recommendations for today?”

The manager handed a tablet to ye Zhuo. “These are the chef’s recommendations.”

“Ye Zhuo took the tablet and lowered his eyes to choose the dishes he wanted to eat. Then, he handed the menu to Cen Shaoqing. “I’ve chosen. What do you want to eat?””

“The same as you.”

“”Then, I’ll add two more dishes?””

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “Just watch what you order.”

Ye Zhuo added another serving of sirloin steak and fried foie gras. He turned to look at the manager and handed the tablet to him. “These will do.”

Seeing this scene.

The manager thought that he was hallucinating.

Ye Zhuo had chosen almost all meat dishes.

But wasn’t Cen Wu a vegetarian?

Oh My God!

This world is too magical!

“If he hadn’t seen it with his own eyes, the manager wouldn’t have believed it at all!”
