“Not only was he unhappy, but he felt like someone owed him money. ”

“Ye Shu and Lin Jincheng came in through the door. When they saw Father Zhao like this, they frowned slightly. ”

“Didn’t you say that Ah Ze is here?”Ye Langhua stood up from the bed. “Why didn’t I see Ah Ze?”

“Ye Shu said, “Ah Ze went home to wash up. He should be here right away.” ”

Ye Langhua nodded.

“The two of them ignored father Zhao and walked into the ward. Ye Shu lowered his voice and asked, “What happened to him?” ”

Ye Langhua shook her head. “I don’t know.”

“On the other side, after doctor Li heard that ye Zhuo had successfully completed the surgery, his face was filled with disbelief. “Is it really done?” ”

“Nurse Wang nodded. “It’s true! Besides, I heard that Ye Sen is out of danger now.” ”

Out of danger?

“With Ye Sen’s condition, how could he be out of danger so smoothly? ”

It was impossible!

Unless a miracle happened.

No.

He had to figure this out.

“Doctor Li narrowed his eyes, stood up, and walked out. ”

“Nurse Wang asked curiously, “Doctor Li, where are you going?” ”

“”I’m going to Ye Sen’s ward to take a look,”doctor Li said. ”

Nurse Wang immediately followed doctor Li’s footsteps.

“Not long after, they arrived at Ye Sen’s ward. ”

The ward was filled with people.

Ye Zao sat on the sofa and played with his phone.

His fair fingers tapped lightly on the screen.

Bang.

The character in the game was shot in the head.

“Doctor Li walked in front of ye Zao. When he saw that ye Zao was still in the mood to play the game, he could not help but be a little surprised. ”

Was she not worried about Ye Sen at all?

No matter what.

“She shouldn’t be playing games at this time, right? ”

“Doctor Li suppressed the emotions in his eyes and continued, “Miracle Doctor Ye, can I take a look at your uncle’s condition?” ”

“Go ahead.”Ye Zao opened his red lips slightly and said without raising his head.

Doctor Li walked to the bedside and began to check on Ye Sen’s condition.

“After a series of checks, doctor Li frowned slightly. ”

“Looking at Ye Sen’s condition, he did not look like he was out of danger. ”

“Not only was he not out of danger, but his situation was even more serious than before. ”

He knew that this matter was not that simple!

“If ye Sen could get out of danger so easily, then wouldn’t his years of being a doctor be wasted? ”

“Doctor Li turned to look at Ye Zhuo. “Miracle Doctor Ye, can I have a word with you?” ”

Ye Zao put away his phone. “Sure.”

“”Miracle Doctor Ye, this way please.” ”

Ye Zao followed Doctor Li’s footsteps.

“When the two of them arrived outside the ward, doctor Li lowered his voice and said tactfully, “Miracle Doctor Ye, I feel that your uncle’s current situation is still very dangerous. He’s not as optimistic as I thought.” ”

Ye Zao’s family trusted ye Zao too much.

They did not know how excited they were now and how sad they would be in a day’s time.

It could even be ten times more sad!

“According to what he had just checked, Ye Sen only had less than a day left! ”

“Ye Zao’s expression was indifferent. His exquisite brows and eyes seemed to be covered by a layer of light, just like the snow on a cold mountain, “Thank you for your concern, doctor Li. I know that you are giving me a kind reminder, but my uncle is currently recovering. He will regain consciousness in about five to six hours.” ”

Five to six hours was a conservative number.

“In fact, Ye Sen would wake up in two to three hours at most. ”

How was that possible!

“If he could really regain consciousness in five to six hours, Ye Sen would not be in this state anymore. ”

The current ye Sen was clearly at the end of his life.

“Doctor Li continued, “Miracle Doctor Ye, let me say something out of line. I feel that you must have made a mistake in your judgment this time. Based on your uncle’s current situation, actually, my personal opinion is to pull out the oxygen tube. It’s too painful for him!” ”

Every minute now was a torture for ye Sen.

Only those who had experienced this kind of feeling would understand.

Death was actually a relief for him.

“At most six hours.”Ye Zhuo turned to look at Doctor Li. “My uncle will definitely wake up.”

Doctor Li felt like he was speaking to a chicken.

Ye Zhuo did not seem to understand what he was saying.

“He had already said that Ye Sen was hopeless, but ye Zhuo had always believed that ye Sen would wake up. ”

Ye Zhuo was too confident. He was so confident that he could not hear any sound.

“Since they had already said that, doctor Li could not say anything more. He continued, “If that is really the case, then it will be another miracle in the medical world!” ”

“If miracles really happened that easily, then it would not be called a miracle. ”
