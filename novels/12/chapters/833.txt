“At this moment, a young woman chased over and held the little girl’s hand. ”

“The little girl looked at her young mother. “Mommy, I want to Eat Candy.” ”

“Good children can’t eat candy! Eating candy will cause cavities!”

“”No, no, no! I just want to eat candy.” ”

Aunt Lang’s memories instantly returned to more than 30 years ago.

“The day before she disappeared, she was just like this little girl, begging for candy. Just like this young mother, she refused to buy candy because she had cavities. ”

“Now that she thought about it, she really regretted it. ”

This was also one of the biggest regrets in Aunt Lang’s life.

How many times did she dream in the middle of the night and wet her pillow with tears.

“In her dreams, she bought her favorite fruit-flavored lollipop for Little Half Moon. ”

“But in real life, it had always been her regret. ”

I’m sorry.

I’m sorry.

“Aunt Lang took a deep breath. She really wanted to stop crying, but she couldn’t stop her tears. ”

“”Aunt Lang, are you okay?” ”

A concerned female voice sounded behind her.

“Aunt Lang turned around and saw that it was Xiao Mei, a staff member of the shop. “I’m fine.” ”

Xiao Mei handed aunt Lang a tissue. “Please Wipe Your Tears.”

Aunt Lang took the tissue.

Xiao Mei had worked for half a month for five years.

“In these five years, the most common thing she had seen was Aunt Lang leaning against the door and wiping her tears. ”

She was looking forward to a miracle.

She was looking forward to half a month coming back to find her.

Unfortunately.

“So many years had passed, but there was still no news of half a month. ”

“Xiao Mei continued, “Are you thinking about half a month again?” ”

Aunt Lang turned to look at Xiao Mei. “Do you think my little half a month can be found back?”

“”Yes, Definitely!”Xiao Mei said with certainty, “A good person deserves a good reward. Aunt Lang, you have done so many good things. The heavens will definitely not mistreat you. I believe that the two of you will definitely be reunited.” ”

“All these years, Aunt Lang had used all the money she had spent on managing the restaurant to help find the missing children. ”

Thirty years.

“She had helped twenty-six parents find their own flesh and blood, but she had not found her own flesh and blood. ”

Everyone knew very well whether Little Half Moon was still alive or not.

She just did not want to say it out loud.

“If she was still alive, it was impossible for her not to appear for so many years... ”

“Hearing Xiao Mei’s words, Aunt Lang felt much better. She smiled and said, “Xiao Mei, you’re right. My Little Half Moon will definitely come back. She also promised me that when she grows up, she will buy me a lot of beautiful clothes.” ”

“When she was young, Aunt Lang loved to look beautiful. ”

The fitting room was always filled with all kinds of new clothes.

“When Little Half Moon saw her, she said that when she grew up, she would buy her mother the most beautiful new clothes in the world. ”

“Xiao Mei nodded. As she comforted Aunt Lang, her eyes could not help but turn red. ”

“In the past, she did not understand why Aunt Lang missed little half moon so much. She even thought that it was just a child? If she lost it, she would just give birth to another child. ”

“It was not until three years ago, when she became a mother, that she finally understood how aunt Lang felt. ”

To a mother.

A child was the heavens.

It was fate!

It was everything.

“Xiao Mei sniffed and said, “Aunt Lang, let me help you in to rest for a while?” ”

“Yes.”Aunt Lang nodded.

Xiao Mei helped Aunt Lang into the house.

“When they entered the house, Xiao Mei poured a glass of water for Aunt Lang. ”

“Aunt Lang took the water, her face still sad. ”

“Aunt.”

“Just then, a gentle female voice sounded from outside the door. ”

“Before she arrived, the voice came first. ”

“”Miss Weiyue is here, right?”Xiao Mei smiled and said, “I’ll go out to take a look.” ”

Xi Weiyue was very good at putting on a facade.

“While she coaxed Aunt Lang, she also fawned over the people around Aunt Lang. ”

“Therefore, the few employees who worked at the Little Half Moon restaurant all liked Xi Weiyue very much. ”

Xiao Mei walked to the door and took a look.

“Sure enough, it was Xi Weiyue. ”

“Xi Weiyue was wearing a pink dress. In one hand, she was holding a large bunch of white lilies of the bell, and in the other hand, she was holding a gift box. ”

“”Miss Weiyue, let me help you with your things.”Xiaomei took the gift box from XI Weiyue. ”

“Xi Weiyue smiled. “Thank you, Xiaomei. By the way, where’s my aunt?” ”

“”She’s inside,”Xiaomei answered. ”

Xi Weiyue held the lilies in both hands and walked into the house.

Aunt Lang was sitting on the armchair.

“Xi Weiyue walked over to Aunt Lang with the flowers in her hands. “Aunt, this bouquet is for you.” ”

“Thank you.”Aunt Lang temporarily forgot about the pain when she saw the pure white lilies of the bell.

“Xi Weiyue smiled. “Auntie, we’re all family. Why are you still treating me like an outsider?” ”

“Aunt Lang personally placed the lilies of the bell into the vase and turned to Xi Weiyue. “Weiyue, why are you free today?” ” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“XI weiyue continued, “Today is such an important day. Of course, I have to accompany Auntie. By the way, Auntie, this is a gift I prepared for sister Half Moon.”Xi Weiyue handed the gift box to Aunt Lang. ”

“Aunt Lang’s emotions, which she had already suppressed, surged up again. ”

Yes.

Today was Little Half Moon’s birthday.

“Aunt Lang’s hands trembled as she took the gift box from XI Weiyue. Tears rolled down her cheeks. “Weiyue, thank you. Thank you for remembering Little Half Moon’s birthday.”XI weiyue almost remembered every birthday of Little Half Moon. ”

“Every time she thought of this, Aunt Lang was very grateful to XI Weiyue. ”

“XI weiyue smiled and said, “Aunt, look at what you’re saying. Sister Half Moon is also my elder sister. As a younger sister, isn’t it normal for me to remember her birthday?” ”

Aunt Lang wiped her tears.

“Xi Weiyue looked at Aunt Lang and continued, “Aunt, actually, my father has always remembered Sister Half Moon’s birthday. This morning, he even specially reminded me to come and visit you.” ”

“At this point, Xi Weiyue paused, “Once, when I woke up in the middle of the night, I even saw my father secretly standing outside the balcony crying. All these years, he never dared to mention half moon sister in front of you. He was afraid that you would be sad, and he was also afraid that you would blame yourself... ... It wasn’t that he didn’t care about half moon sister ... .. ”

“”After Half Moon sister went missing, my father’s sadness was no less than yours...” ”

“At the end of her sentence, Xi Weiyue’s eyes turned red as well. ”

Little Half Moon had been lost in Aunt Lang’s hands.

“She was only half a body away, and Little Half Moon had been taken away. ”

“All these years, Aunt Lang had been living in deep self-blame. ”

“Back then, if she had not turned around and held little half moon’s hand tightly, such an accident would not have happened. ”

“Now, Xi Weiyue’s words made her cry again. ”

“XI weiyue continued, “Aunty, I know you hate my father, but think about it from another angle. Actually, my father was quite pitiful. He lost his daughter before he was thirty, and then you broke up with him. Although he married my mother, he only married after he divorced you. I hope you can understand him. He has been through a lot these years...”. ...” ”
