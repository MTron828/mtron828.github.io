“If it wasn’t for her, would ye Zao’s name spread across the country? ”

Dream On!

“At that time, when she was looking for her biological parents, it was fine if ye Zao didn’t help, but he still wanted to interfere. ”

Deliberately.

Ye Zao did it on purpose.

“Ye Zao was an orphan that no one wanted, so she felt unbalanced and was jealous that she had biological parents! ”

“If ye Zao did not stop her from doing so, she would have long recognized her biological parents. ”

This was all ye Zao’s fault.

“As long as she recalled those past events, ye Lan wished that she could kill ye Lan with her own hands. ”

There was no special expression on ye Zao’s face.

So that was how it was.

The protection that she thought was given to others was just jealousy.

“Ye Zao said faintly, “So, you still hold a grudge because of this?” ”

“Shouldn’t I hold a grudge?”Ye Lan asked.

“I won’t kill you today.”Ye Zao put away his gun. “But I want to warn you that Miss Ye hasn’t let you down in any way. You should take care of yourself.”

“After saying this, ye Zao turned around slightly and faced everyone. “All of you, if you’re willing to continue following Miss Ye, please follow me.” ”

“With Li Zi Yue as the leader, most of the people in the room followed ye Zao’s footsteps. ”

Even though she wasn’t ye Zao yet.

But she had something similar to ye Zao on her.

“Although ye Lan was very unwilling, she could only let them go. ”

Where did this ugly woman come from!

“If it wasn’t for her, all these people would have been silenced by now. ”

“At that moment, ye Lan didn’t dare to change the plaque anymore. She immediately went to the Qiu residence and reported everything that happened here to Qiu Di. ”

“Hearing this, Qiu di frowned slightly. ”

“Who is that woman?”

“The question she was most worried about now was not who that woman was, but whether that woman would affect her position! ”

Ye Lan shook her head. “I’ve never seen her before.”

“”Could it be...”Zhou Qing, who was at the side, said hesitantly, “Could it really be ye Zao who came back?” ”

“Impossible! The one who came is just an ugly woman! She is definitely not ye Zao!”Ye Lan directly denied.

Ye Zao had already died!

How could she have come back!

“”Show me the video,”Qiu di continued. ”

“Okay.”Ye Lan nodded and turned on the portable video.

“Soon, a transparent screen appeared in the air. On the screen was the image of ye Zao holding the gun against Ye Lan. ”

“Zhou Qing said in surprise, “This speed is too fast!” ”

“Before she could even see how ye Zhuo had made his move, Ye Zhuo had already put the gun against Ye Lan’s head. ”

Qiu Di snorted coldly. “It’s just a small trick.”

“At this speed, she could even close her eyes! ”

An ugly girl. She felt dirty just by looking at her.

It was fortunate that ye Lan was so frightened.

“Xiao Ya!”Qiu Di continued.

“”Yes, miss.”Xiao Ya immediately walked over from the side. ”

“Qiu di continued, “Investigate this ugly woman’s background.” ”

“Yes.”

Xiao Ya nodded respectfully. She took the scanner and quickly locked onto the facial features of the person on the screen.

“Soon, a line of information appeared on the scanner — ”

Name: Joey. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Gender: Female.

Age: 21.

“Seeing this, Qiu Di’s face was full of disdain. ”

Joey?

A nobody that she had never heard of.

“Most importantly, before ye Zao had pacified the state of Chang Yue, Qiao was the lowest surname in the state of Chang Yue. ”

She was not even qualified to be a servant for a rich family.

“When she saw this information, ye Lan suddenly thought of something, then she said, “Oh, I remember! This Joey was ye Zhuo’s little sidekick! He followed ye Zhuo every day and blew rainbow farts! I thought who it was! So it was her!” ”

“If she had known that it was Joey, she would not have let them go back then. ”

Ye Lan was very regretful now!

“After thinking for a while, ye LAN continued, “Eldest miss, please give me some time. I promise that within three days, I will capture Joey and personally kowtow to you to confess your crimes!” ”

“There’s no need.”The corners of autumn flute’s mouth curled up.

“Hearing this, Ye Lan was stunned. ”

There was no need.

“Autumn flute continued, “Compared to kowtowing to plead guilty, I prefer to watch them bite each other’s fur.” ”

“Now That Ye Zhuo was dead, there was only a group of small fries left. Wouldn’t it be dog biting dog fur in the future? ”

Autumn flute was looking forward to the scene that followed.

Killing each other.

It would definitely be very good to watch.

Ye Lan also understood autumn flute’s intentions instantly. Her eyes flashed with ridicule.

“”Alright, you can go back first.”Autumn flute continued to speak. ”

Ye Lan nodded.

“Wait a moment.”Autumn flute seemed to have thought of something and called out to Ye Lan.
