Then there was a video from that day in the hand room.

“With the video, the direction of the wind changed in an instant. ”

“”My God, how can there be such a mother in the world!” ”

“”It’s really disgusting! Indeed, we can’t look at the problem too one-sidedly.” ”

“”How should we put it? Before the little girl has made a statement, we can’t believe the hospital’s one-sidedly.” ” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“[ yes, we’ll wait and see how the little girl responds. ] ”

“[ no matter how the little girl responds, the parents’words in the operating room are already disgusting! ] ”

No parent would discuss how to divide the child’s inheritance when their child’s life was on the line.

“Seeing that the matter was getting more and more serious, little Zhao told the situation to Vivi who was far away abroad. ”

“This matter had to be handled personally. Otherwise, it would not be resolved. ”

“After knowing the situation, Vivi immediately made a statement. ”

“She appeared in front of the camera with a smile and looked forward, “Hello, everyone. I’m Xiang Wei. I’m also the daughter of this Ms. Liu in the video. I’m now abroad. I’m very safe and well. Don’t worry about me.” ”

“At this point, she paused, then, she continued, “This Lady Liu left me when I was three years old. During this period, I fantasized countless times that she could bring me back, but she didn’t. Perhaps in her eyes, I’m just a burden! In the past, I only thought that way. Until recently, I was completely certain that in her eyes, I’m just a burden... ... .. ”

“Vivi calmly told her life story. Her eyes did not even turn red during the whole process. When people were extremely disappointed, they did not have any emotions. ”

“However, it touched the countless netizens in front of the camera. ”

“[ don’t be afraid, you will be my daughter from now on! ] ”

[ I’m so angry! This kind of mother does not deserve to live in this world. How can she have the face to ask the hospital for her? Is She a mad dog? Vivi should not return the favor. Is she worthy of this kind of person? She is not worthy of being a mother! ]

[ this kind of person is worse than a Mad Dog! ]

“[ this time, I’m standing at the Hospital! ] ”

[ I’m standing at the hospital too! ]

“[ Vivi, set up an account. From now on, US uncles and aunts will accompany you to grow up and see the world together. ] ”

[ we just found out that Vivi’s pen name in the comic is Vivi. Let’s go and pay attention to Vivi. ]

[ ... ]

“For a time, a lot of people paid attention to Vivi. ”

“Vivi’s fans rose from 300,000 to 600,000. ”

“That night, Vivi had an inspiration and created her new work, “She who fell from the sky,”with the female lead, Fanye. ”

“After opening the first sentence, Vivi’s thoughts surged. She drew ten sentences overnight and uploaded them all backstage. ”

The response of the new manga was particularly good.

“On the first day of its release, the number of comments had exceeded 1,000. ”

“The style of the new manga was indeed very different from before. After all, Vivi was based on Ye Zhuo this time. ”

The female lead was a Doctor Who Saved lives and helped the injured.

“From being unknown to being surrounded by stars, she had doubts and support along the way. This kind of growth-type female lead was more popular. ”

“[ after half a year, the Vivi that we are familiar with has returned. The style of the new manga feels completely different from before. ] ”

[ the female lead is self-reliant and self-reliant. I like it very much. ]

“[ the profession of doctor is really too great. The Doctor Fanye in the story reminded me of Miracle Doctor Ye. If it wasn’t for Miracle Doctor Ye, the cancer would still be incurable. ] ”

[ I also thought of Miracle Doctor Ye. ]

The chief editor didn’t expect that Vivi would start serializing the new manga so soon. He also didn’t expect that the new manga would receive so much attention the moment it was released. He knocked on Vivi’s door that very night.

“Vivi.”

Vivi came over to open the door.

“Sister Linda.”

“Linda looked at Vivi and said, “Why did you start serializing the new comic so soon? Didn’t you say that you needed to rest for a period of time?” ”

“Vivi smiled and said, “I just had an inspiration, so I started.” ”

“Linda continued, “Is the prototype of your new comic Miss Ye?” ”

Vivi did not hide it and nodded. “Yes.”

“Linda continued, “I knew it. Your body has just recovered, don’t tire yourself out. Do what you can.”Although Linda also hoped that Vivi could continue to serialize comics.., setting a new record, the body was still the most important thing. ”

Only with a healthy body could one create a better work.

“”Yes.”Vivi nodded, “Sister Linda, I know, don’t worry.” ”

“Linda continued, “Then from Tomorrow, I’ll bring you soup every morning before I go to work.” ”
