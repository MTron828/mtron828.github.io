Lin Jincheng nodded.

“The kitchen was not big. After placing all the dishes into the dishwasher, Lin Jincheng continued to speak, “Ah Shu, come back with me! In the future, I will never let you mother and daughter suffer any grievances. If my mother makes things difficult for you, then our family will move out to Live!” ”

“Although ye Shu had never met Old Mrs. Lin, she did not have a good impression of her. ”

“If Old Mrs. Lin had not secretly carried Lin ze away, they would not have been separated for so many years! ”

“”I want to ask for Zhuozhu’s opinion,”ye Shu replied. ”

“Of course.”

“After coming out of the kitchen, ye Shu found ye Zhuozhu and asked for her opinion. ”

“Ye zhuozhu smiled and said, “Go back! Of course I have to go back!” ”

“Although Old Lady Lin was very scary and was not an easy person to get along with, it was not a good idea to keep running away. ”

Who knew how many more years she would have to live? Could it be that their family had been hiding from this old lady for the rest of her life?

They definitely had to think of a way to get rid of her once and for all.

Ye Zao had never been a person who was afraid of trouble.

“Moreover, Old Lady Lin had carried Lin ze away without saying a word, indirectly causing ye Shu to suffer for so many years. She really wanted to see what kind of old lady this was and whether she would suffer retribution in the future! ”

“On the other hand, Ye Zhuo also did not believe that Old Lady Lin alone could do so many things. ”

She now suspected that Old Lady Lin definitely had people around her who had ideas and plans.

“Even carrying the wrong child was their handiwork. When she had just transmigrated, Ye Zhuo felt that the original owner’s mind was not quite the same as a normal person’s. Her brain should have been corroded by some medicine. ”

She had to investigate all of this. She couldn’t let the original owner and ye Shu suffer for so many years for no reason.

Ye Shu was no longer the ye Shu of the past. She was someone who was so fierce that she dared to chop off her own fingers. Ye Zao didn’t have to worry about ye Shu being bullied by Old Lady Lin at all.

“Okay.”Ye Shu nodded. “Then I’ll go tell your father now.”

Ye Shu went to the kitchen. “Zaluo has agreed to go back with us.”

“Hearing this, Lin Jincheng was extremely excited. He wanted to hug ye Shu, but he didn’t dare. “Ah Shu, thank you and Zaluo! I’ll definitely hold a grand family recognition banquet for you and your daughter!” ”

“The wealthy families paid the most attention to ceremonies. If they didn’t even hold the most basic family recognition banquet, then everyone would really wonder if ye Shu and ye Zaluo were shameful. ”

“Therefore, not only was this banquet to be held, but it was also going to be a grand event that would be known by the entire city! ”

“He had to let everyone know that not only did Lin Jincheng have a wife, but he also had a daughter who was twins with Lin Ze. ”

“After washing the dishes and coming out of the kitchen, ye Zao handed Lin Jincheng a bottle of medicine. “If you believe me, stop taking the medicine now and take the Medicine I gave you. Take this medicine three times a day, one pill at a time.” ”

“”Zhuo Zhuo, you studied medicine?”Lin Jincheng was a little surprised. ”

Ye Zhuo’s tone was indifferent. “I know a little bit of medicine.”

“Lin Jincheng nodded. “Okay, father will remember it.” ”

“Although ye Zhuo was young, as a father, Lin Jincheng did not doubt ye Zhuo’s medical skills at all. ”

“Even if ye Zhuo really gave him a bottle of poison, he would still eat every single one of it. ”

“When the outside world learned that the Lin family was going to hold a family recognition banquet, they all sighed. ”

They felt that it was not worth it for Feng Qianhua and Feng Xianxian.

“That was because, compared to Feng Qianhua, Lin Jincheng’s wife was a vulgar country woman. She was uneducated, uneducated, and had no family background. ”

As for his daughter...

“That was even worse. She could not be compared to Feng Xianxian. She had been an idiot since she was young, and it was said that she could not even read Chinese characters. ”

What was the use of recognizing the old and the young?

Was it embarrassing?

Many people accepted the Lin family’s invitation with the attitude of watching a good show.

They wanted to see how the mother and daughter would lose face at the banquet.

...

“At noon, Ye Zhuo arrived at the CEN group. ”

“When she arrived, Cen Shaoqing was in a meeting, so ye Zhuo sat at his desk and waited for him. ”

In the conference room.

“Cen Shaoqing stood in front of the conference table. He leaned slightly and looked at everyone. He clearly did not say anything, but the pressure in the conference room had dropped to the freezing point. ”

The higher-ups did not even dare to breathe loudly. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

They were scared.

“After a while, he tapped the table with his fingers. “This is the plan that your planning department has come up with?” ”

The head of the planning department felt a chill on the back of his neck.

Ding —

“At this moment, the phone on the table rang. ”

“Cen Shaoqing looked sideways at the phone, and the coldness in his eyes faded a little. He picked up the phone and said, “That’s all for today’s meeting. Dismissed!” ”

“As soon as he said this, Cen Shaoqing had already walked out of the meeting room. ”

The higher-ups looked at each other in dismay. They actually felt a sense of ecstasy as if they had escaped death.

“While they were rejoicing, they were also curious. who was the person who sent Master Five a message? ”

The influence was actually so great.

There was also that Pink Piglet’s phone case.

When had master five CEN ever had such a young girl’s heart?

Could it be... Master Five’s wife?

“The moment Cen Shaoqing pushed open the office door, he saw ye Zhuo sitting on his boss’s chair with his legs crossed on the office desk. ”

His posture... was a little heroic.

“It was the first time Cen Shaoqing had seen such an unscrupulous girl, yet he loved her to the bone. ”

“Seeing him enter, ye Zhuo lazily raised his eyelids. “Cen Shaoqing, I want to tell you something.” ”

This tone.

This way.

“Other than ye Zhuo, there was another person who dared to do this in front of Cen Shaoqing? ”

Did he want to die?

“”I’m all ears.”Cen Shaoqing held the Buddha bead in his hand. “Please enlighten me, leader.” ”

“”I found my biological father,”ye Zhuo said slowly. ”

Biological Father?

Cen Shaoqing was stunned.

“Really?”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “Yes.”

“Then...”Cen Shaoqing counted the Buddha bead. “Who is your future father-in-law?”

“”Lin family, Lin Jincheng.” ”

Lin Jincheng?

“Cen Shaoqing was stunned again. If he remembered correctly, Lin Jincheng had a son. “Then you and Lin Ze are?” ”

“He should be a younger brother, right? ”

The kind of half-brother?

“Ye Zhuo said concisely, “He and I are twins.” ”

Brother and sister?

“In that case, not only did ye Zhuo recognize a biological father, but he also recognized an older brother for him? ”

An older brother twelve years younger than him?
