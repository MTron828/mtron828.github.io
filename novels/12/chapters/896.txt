“You’re So Nice.”

“There was no car in front, so Zhou Rui lowered his head and kissed Cen Yuyan.”

Cen Yuyan’s heart was instantly filled to the brim.

Little did she know that Zhou Rui’s heart was about to vomit.

“Soon, the car stopped in front of a high-class hotel.”

The two of them walked in arm in arm.

“There was a violinist playing the romantic “Serenade”in the hall, and the atmosphere was very good.”

“During dinner, Zhou Rui very considerately cut the steak in front of Cen Yuyan. “Yuyan, I want to discuss something with you.””

“Go ahead.”Cen Yuyan took a bite of the steak.

“Zhou Rui continued, “I want to bring you home to meet my parents.””

Meet My Parents?

Cen Yuyan’s heart raced when she suddenly heard this.

“She and Zhou Rui had been talking for some time, but Zhou Rui had never taken the initiative to bring her home to meet his parents. At first, Cen Yuyan thought that Zhou Rui was concerned about her age.” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“But now, it seemed that she had misunderstood Zhou Rui.”

“If Zhou Rui really cared about his age, he wouldn’t have brought up the matter of meeting his parents.”

Cen Yuyan raised her head to look at Zhou Rui. “Then will your parents mind my age?”

“”No.”Zhou rui smiled and said, “My parents are very open-minded people. They know that you’re very outstanding, so they want to meet your future daughter-in-law.””

“When she heard the words ‘daughter-in-law’, Cen Yuyan’s face immediately turned red. “What nonsense are you talking about?””

“Zhou Rui looked at Cen Yuyan and asked very seriously, “Don’t you want to be my parents’daughter-in-law?””

“After saying that, Zhou Rui continued, “If you don’t want to go, I won’t force you. But Yuyan, there’s one thing you must know, and that is that I’m serious about you.””

“Cen Yuyan was afraid that Zhou Rui would misunderstand something and immediately said, “No, no! Zhou Rui, I didn’t mean that. I’m just afraid that uncle and Auntie won’t like me.””

“”They won’t.”Zhou Rui held Cen Yuyan’s shoulder. “You’re so beautiful, your temperament is good, and you were born noble. It’s more like my parents are secretly happy to have a daughter-in-law like you. How could they not like you?””

“Really?”Cen Yuyan raised her head and asked.

“Of course it’s true.”Zhou Rui nodded.

“Cen Yuyan continued to ask, “Then when are we going to see uncle and Auntie?””

“”That depends on when you have the time,”Zhou Rui continued, “My parents said that they will try their best to cooperate with you.””

Cen Yuyan lowered her head and thought for a moment. “Then let’s do it this Saturday.”

“”Okay.”Zhou Rui nodded. “As long as you have no problems, then we have no problems.””

“”Zhou Rui, thank you.”Cen Yuyan hugged Zhou Rui.”

“Zhou rui smiled and said, “What nonsense are you talking about! You are not allowed to say thank you to me in the future!””

“Cen Yuyan continued to ask, “Oh right, Zhou Rui, do uncle and Auntie have any interests or hobbies?””

This meant that the Zhou family’s parents had to prepare a gift for the meeting.

“Zhou Rui narrowed his eyes and continued, “My father is a snob and likes to collect antiques. My mother is especially vulgar and likes jewelry.””

“After spending so much time with Cen Yuyan, Zhou Rui understood Cen Yuyan too well.”

“Cen Yuyan would either not make a move, or as long as she made a move, she would not send those cheap goods, which could easily reach six or seven figures.”

“When he thought of how he could earn a huge sum of money again, Zhou Rui could not be more excited.”

“Cen Yuyan nodded and had a rough idea in her heart. “You’re so condescending and elegant, especially vulgar. Zhou Rui, is that how you talk about uncles and Aunties?””

Zhou Rui pulled Cen Yuyan into his embrace. “You’re not an outsider. Could it be that you’re going to complain in front of my parents?”

Cen Yuyan was overjoyed that this sentence was not an outsider.

The details determined everything.

“From the details, it could be seen that Zhou Rui had already treated her as one of his own.”

“Cen Yuyan smiled and said, “How do you know that I won’t complain to uncle and Auntie?””

“”If you dare to complain, then I’ll punish you.””

“How will you punish me?”

“Zhou Rui’s hand slipped into Cen Yuyan’s clothes. “This way, or this way.””

“Aiya! You’re so bad.”Cen Yuyan smiled sweetly.

“It was Cen Yuyan’s first day back today, so Zhou Rui was definitely going to accompany Cen Yuyan.”

It was not until the next morning that Zhou Rui returned home.

“Although the Zhou family’s family background was ordinary, because of Song Chenyu, the Zhou family was currently living in a luxurious villa. They even hired two nannies, so their life was very comfortable.”

“”Dad, Mom, I’m back.””

“Zhou Rui entered the house, threw his briefcase on the sofa, and shouted at the top of his voice.”

“Rui Rui is back.”
