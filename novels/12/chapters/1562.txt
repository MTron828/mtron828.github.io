Got It.

An Lizi really knew everything.

What should she do now?

No.

“She wanted to marry Lin Ze, she wanted to become the young mistress of the Lin Family! ”

“”Lizi, I didn’t, I really didn’t! We grew up together, when have I ever lied to you! Someone is framing me!”Zhang Qingqing looked at an Lizi, “Ye Zao! It must be ye Zao! Ye Zao has always looked down on me! She doesn’t want me to marry Lin Ze, this is all ye Zao’s scheme. Lizi, can you trust me? The only person who can help me now is you!” ”

“An Lizi looked at Zhang Qingqing in front of her, the memories of her childhood kept appearing in front of her eyes. ”

This was the Zhang Qingqing that she had known for more than 20 years.

She had changed.

Zhang Qingqing had changed a long time ago.

“”Zhang Qingqing, when did you become like this?”An Lizi was a little heartbroken. “You can go! I Won’t have you as a friend in the future!” ”

“”Lizi, I’m kneeling down for you. Please believe me this time!”As she said that, Zhang Qingqing knelt down on the ground. ”

“She had thought that an Lizi would definitely be soft-hearted, but an Lizi did not even look at her. She turned around and walked into the house. ”

“Looking at an Lizi’s back, the light in Zhang Qingqing’s eyes gradually faded. ”

“After a long while, she stood up from the ground. ” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Since the Lin family wasn’t kind to her, then don’t blame her for being unrighteous! ”

“Lin Ze didn’t recognize this child, right? ”

Fine!

She had plenty of ways to make Lin Ze admit it.

Since when was a barefoot person afraid of wearing shoes?

Zhang Qingqing narrowed her eyes and returned to the hotel.

“Zhang Qingqing’s parents waited at the hotel for a long time. Finally, Zhang Qingqing returned. ”

“When mother Zhang saw Zhang Qingqing return alone, she curiously looked behind her. However, she did not see anyone else and asked, “Why are you alone? Where’s the Lin family’s young master?” ”

“Zhang Qingqing cried out and hugged mother Zhang. “Mom! What should we do! Lin Ze wants to break up with me, and the Lin family won’t acknowledge me!” ”

What?

“Mother Zhang widened her eyes in disbelief. “Qingqing, what did you say?” ”

“Hearing that, Father Zhang and Zhang Lei quickly surrounded her. “What happened? Qingqing, did you and the Lin family’s young master get into a fight?” ”

“”We didn’t get into a fight,”Zhang Qingqing cried. “He didn’t want me anymore! The Lin family thinks that our family is too low-born and doesn’t deserve the Lin family! Dad, Mom, what should I do?” ”

Why did the Lin family bring up all those old grudges?

It was all because they looked down on others! They looked down on the Zhang Family!

“”This is outrageous!”Father Zhang slammed the table angrily. “Who does the Lin family think they are! They can get you pregnant if they want to, and break up if they want to! How can there be such a cheap thing in this world!” ”

“Mother Zhang said, “Qingqing, don’t cry first. Your dad is right. How can there be such a cheap thing in this world! ! You’re still carrying the Lin family’s child in your belly! If it really doesn’t work out, we’ll find the media to expose them! If he dares not take responsibility for you, we’ll sue him for rape!” ”

“Right now, Zhang Qingqing was carrying Lin Ze’s child in her belly! If this matter were to blow up, Lin Ze would be in big trouble! ”

“If rape led to pregnancy, Lin Ze would have to spend a few years in prison no matter what. ”

Was the Lin family willing to let Lin Ze spend a few years in prison?

Father Zhang turned to look at Zhang Qingqing. “Do you have evidence of the two of you being together?”

“Yes!”Zhang Qingqing nodded.

“Before leaving the clubhouse, Zhang Qingqing took a lot of photos. ”

“”That’s Good!”Father Zhang narrowed his eyes, “Don’t look at how big the Lin family is. Once a scandal breaks out, tens of thousands of people will boycott it, and the family will fall in an instant. Qingqing, don’t worry, we will definitely get justice for you!” ”

“With the development of the times, the development of technology, and the development of the Internet, it was no longer an era where power overshadowed the sky! ”

“After hearing father Zhang’s words, Zhang Qingqing felt a lot more at ease. ”

“Zhang Lei said, “I have a friend who works for the newspaper. I will contact him right now.” ”

“Father Zhang raised his head to look at Zhang Lei, then, he said, “Don’t be anxious. Finding the media to expose them is the last step. First, let your sister find the Lin family to negotiate! If the Lin family is still like this, we will find the media to expose them!” ”

“Okay.”Zhang Lei nodded.

“Father Zhang continued, “Qingqing, contact the Lin Family First and see what their attitude is!” ”

“Okay.”

“Zhang Qingqing continued to contact Lin Ze, but Lin ze blacklisted her. So, Zhang Qingqing could only contact buttface. ”

She still had buttface’s wechat.

Zhang Qingqing edited a long paragraph of wechat for Buttface.
