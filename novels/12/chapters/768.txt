“Chapter 769: 171: No. 1! 5, fought over by the big shots”

“They were respectively the calligraphy world, the Chinese painting world, and the chess world.”

The other two were the presidents of the literary world and poetry world.

“One of them had a head full of gorgeous hair, an old man with a sage-like appearance stood out and said, “Chief Li, I heard that you were holding a banquet to welcome miss ye here, so we came uninvited. Chief Li, please don’t take offense.””

“Li Zhentian smiled on the surface, but in his heart, he was F * cking mad.”

It had been less than two hours since he decided to hold the banquet.

Where did these old foxes find out about this news?

What were they here for?

They were just here to snatch people from the literary world.

“The matter of ye Zhuo getting full marks not only shocked the literary world, but also the entire circle.”

A talent like her was really too rare.

“Li Zhentian smiled and said, “Elder Wu, you are too polite. Everyone who comes is a guest. Everyone, please come in.””

“Elder Wu looked at ye Zhuo and continued, “Is this Miss Ye?”” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Li Zhentian really wanted to shake his head and deny it, but he still maintained his smile. “Yes, this is Miss Ye.””

“Hearing this, the eyes of the few people behind elder Wu lit up.”

“This young lady had a clear temperament, and it was hard to ignore her just by standing there.”

No wonder she was able to amaze everyone in the assessment!

“Seeing ye Zhuo in person, the few elders were extremely excited. They wanted nothing more than to immediately pull ye Zhuo into their own camp.”

“At the same time, they were also regretting that they did not have as good a luck as Master Yu.”

If they had met ye Zhuo in advance...

What would master Yu have to do with it?

“Master Yu immediately stood in front of ye Zhuo and said, “What unspeakable things do you guys want to do to my disciple?””

“Elder wu smiled and said, “Elder Yu, what you said is too serious! We just want to see Miss Ye’s true appearance. What unspeakable things do we want to Do?””

“After saying that, elder Wu looked at ye Zhuo and said, “Hello, Miss Ye. I’m the second elder of the calligraphy world, Wu Jianhai.””

“As soon as elder Wu finished speaking, he was immediately pushed aside. “Miss Ye, I’m Qi Kaiyuan, the vice-chairman of the chess world.””

“”I’m Guan Sheng, the first elder of the Chinese painting world. I heard that Liu Caiyi, the vice-chairman of our Chinese Painting Association, accidentally injured Miss Ye during the assessment. I’ll apologize to you on behalf of Liu Caiyi!”! “Don’t worry, Miss Ye. I’ll definitely tell them to give Liu Caiyi a punishment when I get back.””

“The three elders stood in a row, hoping to leave a good impression in ye Zao’s heart.”

“These three people were all big shots from all walks of life. Li Zhentian did not want to offend them, so he continued, “Please come in. We have something to discuss inside.””

“In fact, compared to inviting them inside, Li Zhentian wanted to chase them out.”

Unfortunately.

He couldn’t.

The few of them walked inside.

They arrived at the private room.

Li Zhentian informed the waiter and began to serve the dishes.

The waiter nodded.

“Guan Sheng smiled and said, “Before the dishes are served, I still have a small gift to give to Miss Ye. Please accept it, Miss Ye.””

“I have one too!”

“I have one too!”

Elder Qi of the chess world and elder Wu of the calligraphy world did not allow each other to have one.

The three of them each took out the gifts they had prepared.

It was very unexpected.

The three of them had prepared exquisite desserts.

The three of them looked at each other and saw the surprise in each other’s eyes.

They had thought that they had gotten exclusive information.

They hadn’t expected...

They had miscalculated.

“Seeing that they had prepared the same gifts, elder Wu hurriedly stood up and said, “Miss Ye, this dessert of mine was made by a high-level dessert master. There’s only one serving in the whole world, and it tastes very good! It’s sweet but not greasy!””

“”Miss Ye, this dessert of mine was just flown in from France this morning. It’s said to be the most delicious dessert in the world.””

“Nonsense! Only this dessert of mine is the most delicious dessert in the world!”

“Seeing the three people presenting their treasures, master Yu could not help but curl his lips.”

These individuals were really ambitious.

“In order to snatch his disciple from him, they even found out what ye Zao liked to eat.”

Ye Zao accepted the gifts from the three of them and thanked them one by one.

“After accepting the gifts, they began to serve the dishes.”

No one had expected that the appetizer would be a dessert.

Ye Zao ate with satisfaction.

“Master Yu looked at the ambitious people around him, all of whom were eyeing his disciple. He had a heart-wrenching meal.”

“After half a day, elder Wu raised his cup and stood up. “Miss Ye, let me toast you.””

“Ye Zhuo raised his cup. “Elder Wu, you’re too serious. I’m a junior. I should be the one to toast you.””
