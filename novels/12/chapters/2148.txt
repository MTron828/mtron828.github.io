“Although CEN Shaoqing grew up on Earth, he still had the blood of the General Alliance. ”

What About Ye Zao?

Ye Zao was just an ordinary human with no backing. She couldn’t be compared to Duanmu Fengyu.

“After saying that, Mrs. Duanmu looked at Duanmu Fengyu, then, she said, “Fengyu, as long as you make sure that the old lady’s ears are soft, everything will be easy to handle. The first time is new, the second time is familiar. Just because she scolded you today doesn’t mean that she will scold you tomorrow.” ”

“Do you mean that I have to kiss her ass tomorrow?”Duanmu Fengyu looked at Mrs. Duanmu.

“Mrs. Duanmu said, “I know that doing this might be a little unfair to you! But fengyu, you can only do this now! Unless you want to hand over that position to someone else!” ”

“Hearing this, Duanmu fengyu immediately said, “Mom, I’ll listen to you.” ”

“Okay.”

On the other side.

Old Mrs. Cen came to Ye Zao’s room.

“Yezi! Yezi!”

“Hearing the voice, ye Zao immediately walked out to open the door. “Grandma Cen, I was just about to call you over for breakfast.” ”

“He expected that old Mrs. Cen would not be used to the food of the Allied countries, so ye Zao prepared a lot of delicious food on this trip. ”

“”Yezi, you understand me!”Old Mrs. Cen held ye Zao’s arm. ”

“When they walked into the house, they found that the three sisters of the Cen family were already sitting on the sofa and chatting. When they saw old Mrs. Cen enter, they all stood up to call for her. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen smiled and said, “You guys really know how to enjoy life. You came to Yezi’s place early in the morning to freeload and drink!” ”

“CEN Yueya said, “That nutrient fluid is really terrible. I don’t know how the people here persevered through it!” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen looked around and then asked, “Where is Shaoqing?” ”

“”He should still be in the house,”ye Zhuo answered. ”

“I’ll go take a look.”Old Mrs. Cen walked out.

“Cen Yueya stood up. “Grandma, I’ll go with you.” ”

“No need.”Old Mrs. Cen waved her hand. “I’ll go alone. None of you need to follow me.”

“Alright.”Cen Yueya sat back on the sofa.

Old Mrs. Cen came to Cen Shaoqing’s room and knocked on the door.

“Soon, the door opened. ”

The person who opened the door was Cen Shaoqing.

“Grandma.”

Old Mrs. Cen looked up at him. “Aren’t you going to Yezi’s for breakfast?”

“”I’ll go there later,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen said as she walked in, “I have something to tell you.” ”

“Go ahead.”

Old Mrs. Cen walked to the sofa and sat down. “Have you read the few famous books that I gave you before?”

“What famous books?”Cen Shaoqing was stunned.

“”It’s something like president ba chasing his wife’s 365 styles!”Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Didn’t I give you a stack of them before? So you haven’t read any of them?” ”

“I have.”Cen Shaoqing opened his thin lips.

“Before Old Mrs. Cen gave him the book, he didn’t think that he would be able to read such a book. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen said, “It’s good that you read it. Brat, I’m telling you, you’re at a critical juncture now! According to the plot of President Ba’s novel, at a time like this, it’s easiest for you to have a misunderstanding with the female lead and then have some melodramatic plot! I’m telling you, you can’t! You have to put an end to all misunderstandings and melodramatic plot!” ”

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Old Mrs. Cen said again, “From now on, you can’t be alone with that little house sparrow, and you can’t talk to her either! You have to Remember, your girlfriend, the future daughter-in-law of our Cen family, can only be Yezi forever! If you dare to do something that causes Yezi to misunderstand, I’ll teach you a lesson! Did you hear that? !” ”

“”I heard it,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen was still a little worried, “I usually hate reading those novels that are full of melodrama. So, Brat, you better watch out! Not only can you not let ye Zao Misunderstand You, you also can’t let ye Zao Suffer! Not even a little bit!” ” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Cen Shaoqing continued to nod his head.

Old Mrs. Cen gave Cen Shaoqing a lot of questions before she finally gave up. She returned to Ye Zao’s room and began to eat breakfast.

On the other side.

Manxing country.

The Information Manxing had asked people to look up had already been found.

“Manxing immediately opened the document and quickly flipped through it. When he found out that ye Zao was just an ordinary human from Earth, his eyes were filled with disappointment. ”

He wasn’t.

But how could there be people in the world who looked so alike?

“But thinking about it carefully, there were so many planets in the universe that had life forms. It was normal for one to occasionally look alike. ”
