“When he was analyzing the composition of the drug, Ye Zhuo was so busy that he did not sleep for two whole nights. The next day, he was still in high spirits and went to the sterile room to do experiments. ”

Rumors were terrible.

Just the rumors and the white eyes were not something that ordinary people could bear.

“After defeating the cancer cells, it was supposed to be her time to shine. However, she retreated behind the scenes and hid her achievements and fame. ”

“If it was anyone else, they would not be as indifferent to fame and fortune as she was. ”

“Su Zishan looked at the reporters supporting Gu Dening, and her heart felt extremely uncomfortable. ”

She should be the one who was supported by the stars.

It should be her.

Who was Gu Dening? She had never even walked out of the country.

“Thinking that in the future, not only would gu dening appear in front of the national television station, but she would also appear in front of the global audience, and that in the future, all the people who would interact with GU dening would be medical professors from all over the world, Su Zishan was very jealous. ”

Yes.

Jealous.

“As a proud daughter of heaven, Su Zishan had never been jealous of anyone. Even she herself did not expect that one day, she would be jealous of a country bumpkin who had never even walked out of the country. ”

This kind of jealousy made Su Zishan feel like she could hardly breathe.

This opportunity should have been hers!

“If she could turn back time, she would definitely not look down on ye Zao. ”

She would definitely not reject this opportunity.

“If she were to be ye Zao’s assistant, she would definitely be ten times or a hundred times better than Su Zishan. ”

Unfortunately.

There was no way to turn back time in this world.

Rumble —

“At this moment, a loud noise appeared in the air. ”

Everyone turned their heads to look out of the window.

They saw.

A few helicopters flew over the hospital.

“”Doctor Su! Doctor Su! The director is looking for you!”At this moment, a nurse rushed over. ”

“”Okay.”Gu decing turned around and apologized to the reporter. Then, she left with the nurse. ”

“The reporter could not interview gu decing, so he had to interview the other doctors in the hospital. ”

“”Hello, May I ask if it was true when doctor Gu said that few people in your hospital believed that Miracle Doctor Ye could cure cancer?” ”

“The doctor who was interviewed looked a little embarrassed, but he could only tell the truth. After all, there were people who were more embarrassed and regretful than them, “It’s like this, doctor Gu is right. In fact, our director Zhou recommended other doctors to be Miracle Doctor Ye’s assistants in the beginning, but this doctor refused because he had other patients in his hands! Later, it was doctor Gu who volunteered.” ”

“Because he was too curious about Miracle Doctor Ye, the reporter asked him about Miracle Doctor Ye again. ”

“Miracle Doctor Ye is young and very beautiful.”

“But other than being young and very beautiful, he could not ask any other questions. ”

Because the hospital director had specially instructed before that ye Zhuo’s identity could not be exposed to the public.

“The reporter did not give up and went to ask the cleaning lady in the hospital again, “Have You Seen Miracle Doctor Ye?” ”

“”I have.”The cleaning lady nodded and tried her best to recall the brief encounter before she gestured to the reporter, “Miracle Doctor Ye is about this tall, MM, taller than you, thinner than you, and whiter than you. She is very beautiful! “I have worked in the hospital for so many years, but I have never seen such a beautiful little girl! She is so handsome! No one would believe that she’s a miracle doctor!” ”

The cleaning lady suddenly saw the reporter’s phone case. “Hey! She’s even more beautiful than the Big Star on your phone case!”

The Big Star was song Chenyu.

She was known as a beauty that only appeared once in five thousand years.

“Hearing this, the reporters were stunned. ”

How could anyone be more beautiful than song Chenyu?

She felt that the cleaning lady had over-beautified this Miracle Doctor Ye.

“After interviewing the cleaning lady, the reporter went to interview other hospital staff. ”

The answer was the same.

She was very beautiful.

She was young.

“After the reporter’s interview, there was a new hot search on various websites. ”

“For a moment, everyone was filled with curiosity towards Miracle Doctor Ye. They all wanted to know who he was. ”

Unfortunately.

Even the top hackers could not find any information about Miracle Doctor Ye.

[ my surname is also Ye! I suddenly feel my face lit up! ]

[ Miracle Doctor Ye has benefited all mankind. It can be recorded in history. ]

“[ it is certain to be recorded in history, but Miracle Doctor Ye is too low-key. He might not be willing to reveal his personal information to be recorded in history. ] ”

“[ this doctor Gu is also very capable! When Miracle Doctor Ye was being questioned, she had always been by Miracle Doctor Ye’s side. She did not give up and did not give up. She liked her very much! ] ”
