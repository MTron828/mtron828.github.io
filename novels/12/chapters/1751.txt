“Chapter 1752: 361: unexpected reversal, Feng Ying’s death! 1”

Translator: 549690339

“At this moment, ye Zao was wearing an isolation suit as he worked in the laboratory. ”

“By now, the space-time shuttle had been half-researched and was stuck at the most crucial step. There was still one chip left. ”

“As long as he found a suitable chip, he could activate the shuttle. ”

“Miss Ye.”Cen Hu jogged over.

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo put down the controller and looked up at Cen Hu.

“Cen Hu continued, “Miss Ye, Feng Qi’s mother wants to see you.” ”

Feng Qi’s mother?

Ye Zhuo was stunned. “Who’s Feng Qi?”

“”It’s Professor Feng.”Cen Hu explained, “She said she has something important to ask you.” ”

Professor Feng’s mother wants to see her?

“Ye Zhuo frowned slightly and asked, “Where is she now?” ”

“She’s at the door.”Cen Hu looked up at Ye Zao. “Do you want to see her now?”

“”Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly. Although Professor Feng had betrayed the base, it was Feng Qi’s mother standing outside the door. ”

Feng Qi was Feng Qi. These were two different things.

“The old lady said that she had something important to see her, so there must be something. ”

“As Ye Zao spoke, he walked into the preparation room. “Go out and tell the old lady that I’ll be out in five minutes.” ”

“Okay.”Cen Hu nodded. “Then I’ll take her to the waiting room first.”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“On this side, Cen Hu came outside and saw an old man with a head full of silver hair standing there. ”

“The old man looked to be in his eighties or nineties. He was leaning on a cane. Perhaps it was because of the death of his daughter in his old age, but the old man had a hunched back. Looking at him like this, it made people feel a little moved. ”

“”Hello, Old Man.”Cen Hu walked in front of the old lady. ”

“”You, Hello.”The old lady raised her head to look at Cen Hu. ”

“Cen Hu was about 1.8 meters tall. He was tall and strong. Standing in front of the old lady, the old lady had to raise her head to look at him. ”

“Cen Hu said politely, “Old man, I’m Miss Ye’s assistant, Cen Hu. Miss ye is a little busy right now. Please follow me in and wait for her.” ”

“”Alright, thank you.”The old lady followed Cen Hu’s footsteps. ”

“The waiting room was inside the base, so it was still some distance to walk over. In order to take care of the old lady, Cen Hu deliberately slowed down his footsteps. ”

“The old lady walked and watched along the way. When she remembered that Feng Qi had once worked here, her eyes welled up with tears. ”

“Things are not as they should be. If one wanted to say something, tears would flow first. ”

“If Feng Qi did not do it, he would be like Cen Hu, a member of the Cen family’s base... ”

Unfortunately.

There were no ifs in this world.

Feng Qi had already become a traitor and was forever nailed to the pillar of shame.

“Thinking of this, the old lady sighed. ”

“Feeling the change in the old lady’s mood, Cen Hu slowed down and lowered his head to ask, “Old Lady, are you okay?” ”

“”I’m fine, I’m fine, I’m fine.”The old lady wiped her tears and tried her best to squeeze out a smile. ”

“Cen Hu did not know what to say. He had always been a person who did not know how to comfort others, so he could only pretend that he did not see the old lady wiping her tears. ”

“A few minutes later, Cen Hu brought the old lady to the waiting room. ”

Ye Zhuo was still inside changing into his isolation suit and had not come out yet.

“Cen Hu asked someone to pour a cup of tea for the old lady. “Have some tea first. Be careful, it’s hot.” ”

“”Thank you, young man.”The old lady smiled and thanked him. ”

“”You’re welcome.”Cen Hu continued, “Miss Ye’s side might have to wait a few more minutes before coming over. It’s been hard on you to wait.” ”

The old lady looked at Cen Hu. “It’s not hard on you. It’s fine for me to wait. I have nothing to do anyway.”

“Soon, footsteps could be heard in the air. ”

A slender figure walked in from outside.

“The crystal lights pulled her figure a little too long. She was not there yet, but her aura was already there, making it hard for others to catch up to her. ”

The old lady narrowed her eyes.

Cen Hu immediately looked up. “Miss Ye!”

“At this moment, the figure outside the door appeared in the air and nodded slightly at Cen Hu. “Yes.” ”

“Then, Ye Zhuo walked in front of the old lady and said, “Hello, Old Lady. I’m Ye Zhuo. I heard that you have something to talk to me about.” ”

“Hearing this, the old lady looked up. ”

“Although she was old, her eyes were not blurry. ”

The little girl standing in front of her was about eighteen or nineteen years old. She had a pretty face and delicate facial features.

“The Old Lady was born into a prestigious family. In her life, she had seen many famous beauties. ” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

But no one had ever made her so stunning!

Was this the Miss Ye who built the aircraft carrier?

The old lady was stunned.

She had to admit that ye Zhuo was very different from what she had imagined.

“She had thought that Miss Ye was in her twenties or thirties, but she had not expected her to be so young. ”
