“Chapter 818: 179: Face Smacking, master five: This is my girlfriend, Ye Zhuo! 3”

Translator: 549690339

“Professor Yue looked at Ye Zhuo, his expression unchanged. ”

“Ye Zhuo greeted politely, “Professor Yue.” ”

“Professor Yue nodded, then turned to look at Cen Shaoqing. “Master Five, are you guys going to the R & D Department?” ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“”Just in time, I’ll go with you to take a look.”After saying that, professor Yue continued, “Master Five, why don’t we let Xiaoxue take miss ye to look around somewhere else first? Xiaoxue, go and show miss ye around our base.” ”

The research and Development Department of the experimental base could not allow outsiders to enter.

“With Ye Zhuo following them, it was not good. ”

Some rules still had to be followed.

“Okay.”Tang Xue nodded.

“No need.”Cen Shaoqing’s voice suddenly sounded. His tone was low. “Zhuozhuo is not an outsider.”

Not an outsider?

Was he trying to clear ye Zhuo’s name?

Professor Yue was stunned. A worried look flashed across his eyes.

She did not expect Cen Shaoqing to say that.

“The R & D Department was the Core Department of the entire experimental base. If ye Zao accidentally revealed any secrets, the consequences would be unimaginable. After all, young girls did not know what was important. ”

Cen Shaoqing had only been dating ye Zao for a few days?

Did he know ye Zao?

Professor Yue furrowed his brows without leaving a trace.

“A fallen beauty, a hero’s tomb. ”

The destruction of a beautiful woman.

“Since ancient times, how many emperors’shoulders had been destroyed in the hands of women? ”

“King Zhou of Shang, Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, Emperor Jie, King You of Zhou, King Xian of Jin, which one of them had not lost their country because of women! ”

It was not easy for professor Yue to get to where he was today.

One mistake could lead to eternal regret.

It was too late to regret.

Professor Yue’s expression was full of worry.

He had thought that Cen Shaoqing could be exempted from the customs.

He did not expect that Cen Shaoqing would not be immune in the end.

It was normal for people to have seven emotions and six desires.

“She could understand that Cen Shaoqing wanted to find a girlfriend. After all, everyone had physiological needs. ”

But Ye Zhuo was too beautiful.

Beautiful women were more likely to cause trouble in people’s hearts.

Those ancient demon concubines that caused trouble to the monarch’s heart were also very beautiful.

“Thinking of this, the worry on Professor Yue’s face became even more obvious. ”

Tang Xue looked at Professor Yue with a normal expression.

“Elder Zhao chuckled and said, “Fifth master is right. Miss Ye is not an outsider, so there’s no need to avoid suspicion. Let’s continue walking.”Elder Zhao’s first impression of ye Zhuo was very good. He felt that this little girl’s body was filled with spiritual energy, she was not an ordinary person. ”

Professor Yue kept a straight face and did not reply.

The group of people continued to walk in the direction of the R & D Department.

“In a short while, they arrived at the R & D Department. ”

“Just as they entered the R & D Department, the head of the R & D department led three people to welcome them. “Master Five, you’re here.” ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

High-tech products could be seen everywhere in the R & D Department. There were even many military products.

“As everyone knew, military technology was tens of times more advanced than civilian technology. ”

All the high-tech products currently used by the Chinese military were all from this experimental base. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Being in the R & D Department gave people the feeling that this was the future of technology.

“If an ordinary person came in, they would definitely be shocked. ”

But who was ye Zhuo?

She was a technology guru standing at the top.

This technology was nothing in her eyes.

There was not even a hint of emotion on her face.

“Professor Yue was discussing the problem with elder Zhao when he turned to look at Ye Zao. Seeing that ye Zao had taken out his phone, professor Yue frowned. “Xiaoxue, come here for a moment.” ”

“”Teacher, What’s Wrong?”Tang Xue jogged over. ”

“Professor Yue whispered into Tang Xue’s ear, “Go and talk to Miss Ye. We have a lot of high-tech equipment here. She’s just a little girl. It Won’t be good if she hurts herself.” ”

“In order to prevent theft, the entire R & D department was filled with laser beams. The slightest carelessness could result in death! ”

“Ye Zao didn’t know what to do. If he bumped into something, he would definitely make a scene! ”

Then it would be a joke.

“Okay.”Tang Xue nodded.

“After saying that, Tang Xue walked over to Ye Zao. “Miss Ye, this is your first time in the R & D Department. Let me show you around.” ”

“”Thank you,”ye Zao declined politely. “I’m just looking around.” ”

“Since ye Zao didn’t want her to follow him, there was no need for her to shamelessly follow him. ”

Even a delicate young lady like ye Zao was not easy to please.

“Tang Xue continued, “Alright, I’ll be right here. If you need anything, you can call me anytime. Oh right, Miss Ye, it’s best if you don’t go to the eastern and northern regions. There are many traps there. The slightest carelessness will trigger the laser beam.” ”
