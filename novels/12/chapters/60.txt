Chapter 61: She Was Not Someone to Be Trifled With

“Pfft!”

Li Qiandong, who was sitting at the back table, was drinking water. When he heard this, he could not help but spit out all the water in his mouth.

‘Eating rats…’

This reply was simply amazing!

The man in plain clothes sitting in front of Li Qiandong was holding a string of bright red Buddha beads in his hand. When he heard this, he slightly raised his eyes. There seemed to be a faint smile between his brows. The vapor from the tea curled up, making that smile seem even more unreal and somewhat cold.

His slender fingers slowly twirled around the polished Buddhist beads. Between his fingers and the Buddhist beads, there was a clear distinction between the dazzling white and cold red.

The little girl’s mouth was very sharp.

She was not someone to be trifled with.

Mu Yourong also knew that the situation was not looking good for her. She had originally wanted to use the fact that Fifth Master Cen was a vegetarian to win the favor of Fifth Master Cen. She had not expected that Ye Zhuo would turn the tables on her.

Mu Yourong narrowed her eyes, then she said, “I am a person who has been a vegetarian all year round. I feel that no matter if it is rabbits or mice, they are all living beings! We should respect life and not casually harm them! Don’t you think that you are being too cruel? Eating meat is a heinous sin. I suggest that you change all the rabbit meat in the shop to vegetarian food and let the rabbits return to nature!”

No matter what, Fifth Master Cen was a vegetarian.

These words would definitely resonate with Fifth Master Cen!

Ye Zhuo frowned slightly.

What was Mu Yourong up to?

Was she possessed?

“Everyone’s beliefs are different. If you eat and are willing to eat, I respect you, but you can not attack people who are not vegetarian. If saying that not being a vegetarian means not respecting life, then vegetarian people similarly do not respect life! Could it be that carrots and vegetables did not have life? All living things in the world have life. True faith is in the heart, not in the mouth.

“If Miss Mu really respects life that much, then you’d better give up on rice. Oh right, you can’t drink water either. After all, water is the source of all living things. If you drink more water, there will be less water on Earth. If you drink less water, you will die of thirst. Miss Mu is so kind, you definitely can’t bear to let the little rabbit die of thirst, right?”

Mu Yourong looked at Ye Zhuo in disbelief. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

What was wrong with this piece of trash!

Since when did her mouth become so sharp?

Originally, she wanted to use the fact that she could not eat meat to show her kindness and generosity. She wanted to let Fifth Master Cen know that she and he were from the same world. She did not expect that Ye Zhuo would now say that even drinking water was a crime!

Yet, Ye Zhuo still said it so convincingly that there was no way to refute it.

No way!

She absolutely could not let Fifth Master Cen’s attention be drawn away by Ye Zhuo. Mu Yourong excitedly grabbed Ye Zhuo’s hand, as if she had just recognized Ye Zhuo, “Oh, it’s Sister Ye Zhuo! You’ve changed so much that I almost didn’t recognize you just now! I’m sorry, I’m used to being a vegetarian. I’m a little not used to seeing you selling rabbit meat here all of a sudden. Please don’t mind me, I didn’t mean any harm. If I had offended you with my words just now, I’ll apologize to you. I’m sorry.”

Only those who were at a disadvantage could gain the public’s attention. That was why Mu Yourong took the initiative to apologize.

This was a common tactic used by high-level ‘white lotus[1]’.

After saying this, Mu Yourong changed the topic and said gently, “Sister Ye Zhuo, I know that you’ve never liked me and have a deep misunderstanding of me. But I believe that after some time, you’ll definitely accept me as your elder sister!”

“What are you trying to say?” Ye Zhuo smiled faintly. “Don’t tell me that after I pick up a piece of trash, it will become a priceless treasure after some time?”

Trash will always be trash.

A White Lotus[2] will always be White Lotus!

The smile on Mu Yourong’s face froze for a moment. She wished that she could stand up and give Ye Zhuo a few slaps, but at this moment, she could only forcefully endure it.

She absolutely could not destroy her beautiful image in Fifth Master Cen’s heart!

“Little Sister sure knows how to joke. You’re still working, right? Then I won’t waste your time. Just help us order a vegetarian hotpot. Oh right, do you have any drinks that you can recommend to us?”

“Green tea[3] is not bad. It suits you very well.” Ye Zhuo smiled, but her smile did not reach her eyes. “I am my mother’s only child. In the future, don’t call me Little Sister. I don’t have time to accompany you in the drama of Sisterly Love.”

Ye Zhuo’s words had a double meaning. Every sentence was sarcastic. Mu Yourong could not lose her temper, so she could only suppress it in her heart. She said softly, “Since you don’t like it, then I won’t call you Little Sister in the future.”

After Ye Zhuo left, Zeng Rou said, “Yourong, Ye Zhuo has really gone too far! Do you want me to teach her a lesson?”

Mu Yourong frowned and said sullenly, “Rou Rou! How can you say such things! Although Zhuo doesn’t treat me as an elder sister, I have always treated her as my biological sister! You are not allowed to bully her!”

Zeng Rou sighed, “Yourong, you are just too kind! If a person is kind, he will be bullied. If a horse is kind, he will be ridden!”

“It’s fine,” Mu Yourong said with a smile. “It’s a blessing to be at a disadvantage.”

Mu Yourong played the role of a kind and generous elder sister while secretly sizing up the situation next to her.

Fifth Master Cen had been sitting at the table next to hers the entire time.

This meant that Fifth Master Cen had definitely noticed her.

After all, other than her, there weren’t many girls in this world who were willing to eat vegetarian food.

Later on, she had to pay attention to her eating manners, maintain her elegance, and regain all the face she had just lost.

With this thought in mind, Mu Yourong subconsciously straightened her back, not daring to relax even a little.

Li Qiandong had been paying attention to Mu Yourong the entire time, and he said in a low voice, “Brother Fifth, the Mu family’s daughter is the same as you! She’s also a vegetarian! No wonder she said that rabbits are cute. I think she’s probably used to eating vegetarian food, so she can’t bear to eat rabbits! In that case, she and you are quite fated.”

If it were anyone else, Li Qiandong would definitely think that the other party was acting.

But this person was Mu Yourong!

Mu Yourong was so kind, she couldn’t do such a pretentious thing.

Cen Shaoqing turned his head unhurriedly, his eyes slightly deep. “Don’t you feel that compared to Mu Yourong, Ye Zhuo is more like a daughter of a prestigious family?”

Whether it was in terms of bearing, appearance, or manner of speaking, Mu Yourong couldn’t compare to Ye Zhuo.

Not to mention Mu Yourong, even the daughters of the rich and powerful socialites in the capital could not compare to Ye Zhuo at all.

Li Qiandong frowned slightly. “Brother Fifth! Don’t be deceived by Ye Zhuo! Perhaps she was acting just now. Who in the Yunjing Province doesn’t know of Ye Zhuo’s reputation?” Li Qiandong thought for a long time and felt that the real Ye Zhuo could not have uttered such words. She was definitely acting!

She was still playing hard to get!

“When did you become so blind?” Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads, and his low voice was tinged with coldness. “The person who was really acting was Mu Yourong. However, it’s obvious that she underestimated Ye Zhuo.”

If Ye Zhuo was really as stupid as the rumors said, then the person who suffered tonight wouldn’t be Mu Yourong, but Ye Zhuo!

“Brother Fifth, you really misunderstood Miss Mu!” Li Qiandong continued, “You don’t understand her at all. Last time, I saw her feeding stray dogs by the roadside. Last time, I saw her send a lost child home, and last time…”

“How could it be so coincidental that you saw her every time?” Cen Shaoqing lit a cigarette. The smoke curled down, and it was impossible to see the expression in those deep eyes. “You’re 28 this year, not 8. Remember to use your brain when you encounter something.”

It was fine if it was just a coincidence.

They had encountered each other so many times, and she had bumped into Li Qiandong so many times. It was clearly intentional.

“Brother Fifth, do I look like a fool in your eyes?” Li Qiandong was a little speechless. Could it be that he could not even differentiate between good and bad? He really did not know why Cen Shaoqing kept speaking up for Ye Zhuo.

Cen Shaoqing slowly blew out a smoke ring. The smoke dispersed and his cold and noble features gradually became clear. After a moment, his thin lips opened slightly. “Be more confident. Change the words ‘do I look like a fool’ to ‘I am a fool’.”

Li Qiandong did not have any other shortcomings except that his eyesight was not good.

He often fell for women.

“Brother Fifth, you must not be deceived by her!”

Li Qiandong was too excited. He swept his arm and knocked over the teapot on the table. Just as the teapot was about to fall to the ground, break into pieces and splash water all over his body…

“Be careful.” A hand as white as jade quickly caught the teapot and put it back on the table steadily. “This is freshly brewed tea. It’s very hot!”

The hand belonged to Ye Zhuo. Looking up, he saw Ye Zhuo’s extremely calm face.

Cen Shaoqing raised his eyes slightly and looked at her. His deep eyes were pitch black, and his voice was low and deep as he said, “Not bad.”

The term ‘Green Tea B*tch’ refers to a woman who presents herself as innocent, sweet, and kind in order to approach guys who she finds useful, potentially in the sense of money, power, or purely fulfilling. Yet this woman is actually calculating and all her good qualities are fake merely in order to appeal the guy. This woman uses many methods to achieve her goal, usually involves lying and being immoral.
