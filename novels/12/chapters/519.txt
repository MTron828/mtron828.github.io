“Which Six Words?”Cen Shaoqing raised his eyebrows slightly.

“Old Mrs. Cen said, “That is buy buy buy buy! Pamper! It’s best to Pamper the female lead to death!”She had not read romance novels for nothing these years. She had more or less summarized some experience. ”

Novels originated from life.

Cen Shaoqing:”...”

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Right, there’s another very important rule that you have to Remember.” ”

Cen Shaoqing:”? ? ?”

Rule?

“Old Mrs. Cen said, “This rule follows the three virtues and the four Virtues.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly. “Grandma, it’s already a new society now, and you still want to use this kind of thing to restrict searing?” ”

“”I already said that it’s your rule!”! “What does it have to do with searing!”Old Mrs. Cen continued, “I told you to remember well. The three followers and four virtues are: the wife goes out to follow; the wife obeys orders; the wife says the wrong thing blindly; the wife puts on makeup and waits; the wife remembers her birthday; the wife tolerates beatings and curses; the wife is willing to spend money!” ”

“Cen Shaoqing:”? ? ?”If he remembered correctly, wasn’t the three followers and four virtues following the father before marriage? Since the husband was married, the husband died and followed the son? ”

“Seeing that Cen Shaoqing didn’t speak, Old Madam Cen stood on Tiptoe and patted his arm. In fact, she wanted to give him a slap on the head, but unfortunately, she wasn’t tall enough. “I’m talking to you! Did you hear that? Are you not convinced?” ”

“I’m not convinced. I heard it all.”

Old Madam Cen didn’t believe Cen Shaoqing. “Then can you recite it for me?”

Cen Shaoqing’s memory was very good. He recited the new edition of three virtues from four virtues almost word for word.

“Only then was old Mrs. Cen satisfied. “I didn’t realize that a brat like you had such a high comprehension ability! Alright, read all these books by yourself! After reading them, you’ll be able to find the direction. I’ll go downstairs first.” ”

“After taking a few steps, old Mrs. Cen seemed to have remembered something. She turned back and pulled out a book from the pile of books, “Oh right, you must never learn from the scumbag male protagonist in this book! This book is used as a negative example for you!” ”

“Cen Shaoqing had never read any romance novels before. He frowned and said, “Is there anything special about this book?” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen gritted her teeth and said, “The male protagonist in this book is a big scumbag! Not only did he dig out the heart and kidneys of the female protagonist, he also misunderstood the female protagonist! Anyway, the female protagonist is miserable! In short, you just need to remember that he is your negative example!” ”

“”If this jerk was my eldest grandson, I would have beaten his dog head askew long ago!” ”

“At this point, Old Mrs. Cen waved her fist fiercely. ”

“Cen Shaoqing:”...”he suspected that old Mrs. Cen was implying something about him, but he had no evidence. ”

“After saying this, old Mrs. Cen walked downstairs. ”

“”Grandma, wait a minute.”Cen Shaoqing called out to Old Mrs. Cen. ”

“What’s Wrong?”Old Mrs. Cen turned around.

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “Grandma, are you going to the Lin family’s banquet tomorrow?” ”

“”No,”old Mrs. Cen answered without thinking. ”

The main reason was that she couldn’t stand that old fool.

Was she going to look for trouble?

“”Grandma, do you know who uncle Lin’s long-lost daughter is?”Cen Shaoqing continued to ask. ”

“”Who I love has nothing to do with me.”Old Mrs. Cen said angrily, “Anyway, I can’t be bothered with those stupid things in the Lin Family!” ”

“Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads.”... maybe, it really has something to do with you.” ”

“What do you mean?”Old Mrs. Cen narrowed her eyes.

Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips parted slightly. “Zhuo Zhuo is Uncle Lin’s long-lost daughter.”

“What?”Old Mrs. Cen widened her eyes in disbelief.

“You didn’t hear wrong.”

“Old Mrs. Cen’s face immediately fell, “Yezi is such a good child. How can she be that old fool’s sweet granddaughter? No Way! Impossible! There must be a mistake. Yezi is Yezi! Yezi can’t be her granddaughter!” ”

Granny Cen was jealous.

It was unbearable.

“She was such a cute old lady, but she couldn’t even have a granddaughter as outstanding as ye Zhuo. What right did Zhao fangyue have? ”

What right did she have to be stupid?

What right did she have to be deaf?

What right did she have to be blind?

It took Granny Cen a long time to digest this fact. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “So, are you still going to the Lin family’s banquet?” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen nodded, “Yes! Of course! Why shouldn’t I go to my granddaughter-in-law’s banquet! If I don’t go, what if that old fool bullies my granddaughter-in-law?” ”

“All the way downstairs, old Mrs. Cen was still a little depressed. ”

“Zhou Xiang asked curiously, “Mom, What’s wrong with you?” ”
