“”Okay.”Mrs. Han nodded and asked again, “How many times can I go out on that day?” ”

“”Two or three times is enough.”Ye Zhuo reminded again, “In addition, you can eat some things in the next few days, but you can’t eat too hard. After a month, your diet will return to normal.” ”

“Mrs. Han took notes one by one, not daring to be careless. ”

“”By the way, do you have a pen and paper?”Ye Zhuo continued to ask. ”

“”Yes, yes!”Han Laoshan, who was standing at the side, quickly nodded. “Aunt Qing, go get a pen and paper!” ”

“Okay.”Aunt Qing turned around to get a pen and paper.

“Soon, Aunt Qing came in and handed the pen and paper to Ye Zhuo. ”

Ye Zao took it and started to write the prescription.

“A few minutes later, ye Zao handed the finished prescription to Mrs. Han. “From today onwards, let Mr. Little Han take this prescription.” ”

“”Okay.”Mrs. Han took the prescription and nodded. After a moment, she exclaimed, “Godly Doctor Ye’s handwriting is so beautiful! Have you practiced it before?” ”

“The words on the prescription were so strong that they penetrated the back of the paper. The Strokes were like dragons and snakes, and the strokes were like the bones of a willow tree. Without a person who had more than ten years of writing skills, it would be impossible to write it. ”

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Actually, he had not practiced it much. It was just that he had written too many words, so it became more beautiful. ”

“Mrs. Han continued, “Godly Doctor Ye, how long will you take to take this prescription?” ”

“Ye Zhuo said, “Three times a day. Just drink it for a month straight.” ”

“Okay.”

“Ye Zhuo opened the medicine box and took out a small porcelain bottle. “Right, this is to be eaten together with Chinese medicine.” ”CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Is it also three times a day?”Mrs. Han asked

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Okay.”

Ye Zhuo gave some advice on what not to eat when taking medicine and then proposed to leave.

Han Laoshan and Mrs. Han sent ye Zhuo to the door.

“Watching the black car disappear into the night, Mrs. Han sighed and said, “Miracle Doctor Ye is really amazing! Her character is also good. If anyone marries her in the future, it would be like smoke rising from the ancestral grave!” ”

“”That’s right,”Han Lao Shan agreed. ”

“After a moment, Han Lao Shan reacted and continued, “Chief ye has a boyfriend.” ”

“Who is it?”Mrs. Han was very curious.

She really could not imagine what kind of man would be worthy of such an outstanding girl like Ye Zhuo.

“Han Lao Shan said, “Cen Fifth Master.” ”

“CEN Fifth Master?”Mrs. Han thought for a moment. “Is he the one from the Cen Family?”

“Yes.”Han Laoshan nodded.

“Mrs. Han smiled and said, “If that’s really the case, then these two people are simply a perfect match!” ”

“Although Cen Shaoqing kept a low profile and rarely showed his face, Mrs. Han had seen him once at a banquet two years ago. ”

“At that time, she had been astounded. ”

“Unfortunately, Cen Shaoqing was still an unmarried man at that time. ”

…

On the other side.

Zhao family.

It was already past eight o’clock in the evening when Zhao Xueyin returned home.

Father Zhao’s expression was a little ugly. “Didn’t I tell you to come back as soon as possible?”

“Zhao Xueyin took a deep breath. “Dad, can’t you just let me calm down?” ”

PA —

“At this moment, Father Zhao threw a red invitation card at Zhao Xueyin. ”

“What is this?”Zhao Xueyin asked.

“Father Zhao continued, “It’s an invitation to Old Lady Ming’s birthday banquet.” ”

The Ming family was also one of the few financial masters in the financial world. Old Lady Ming’s birthday banquet would definitely gather all the powerful people in the financial world.

“Now, Zhao Xueyin had nothing. She had to use this opportunity to consolidate her connections! ”

“”Didn’t you say that even if you can’t marry Fifth Master, you can still marry Jin Ruyu, the heir of the Jin family? I’ve asked around, and Jin Ruyu will also attend Old Lady Ming’s birthday banquet.” ”

Zhao Xueyin picked up the invitation.

She was indeed too careless about fifth master.

But Jin Ruyu was definitely in her pocket!

“Thinking of this, Zhao Xueyin narrowed her eyes. ”

The next night.

Zhao Xueyin arrived at the banquet on time.

“Just as Father Zhao had said, celebrities gathered at the banquet. ”

It was a dazzling sight.

“Xueyin.”

A socialite saw Zhao Xueyin and welcomed her warmly.

Zhao Xueyin raised her head slightly. “Si Lan.”

“The person who came was called Wen Si Lan, an old classmate of Zhao Xueyin for many years. ”

“Wen Si Lan held Zhao Xueyin’s arm intimately and said with a smile, “Long time no see. Xueyin, how have you been?” ”

“Upon hearing this, a sinister light flashed across Zhao Xueyin’s eyes. ”

“If it wasn’t for Ye Zhuo’s sudden appearance, she would already be the chief of Shunxi Financial Group and fifth master’s fiancée! ”

Why would she need to attend such a banquet?

“At this moment, discussions could be heard from the door. ”

Zhao Xueyin raised her head and saw a familiar figure.

The person was wearing a custom-made suit with a white shirt button tied to the top.

“Looking Up, it was an exquisite pair of eyes and brows. ”

This was…

Si Lu?

Why would si lu appear here?

“Could it be that he knew that she would attend the banquet tonight, so he chased her here? ”

“Zhao Xueyin frowned slightly, her eyes filled with disgust. ”

“Wen Si lan continued, “Xueyin, you definitely don’t know him, right? He is Jin Ruyu, the heir of the Jin family. I heard that he has been studying abroad in C Nation all these years, and he just returned recently.” ”
