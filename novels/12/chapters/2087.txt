Chapter 2088: 433: would he be influenced by a woman? 3

Translator: 549690339

She was just laughing.

“Duanmu feng continued, “It’s normal to be discovered. Why Don’t you take a look at young master’s identity? What’s Your Identity!” ”

Duanmu Feng was a woman who was unwilling to be ordinary.

“If the young master of the eastern fence on Earth was an idiot, would she consider marrying him? ”

“The person who was worthy of her, Duanmu Feng, would definitely be someone who had absolute power and stood at the top of the world. ”

“Hearing this, Wang Meilin instantly understood what she meant and immediately nodded. “You’re right.” ”

“Duanmu feng asked again, “You didn’t find anything on this trip?” ”

“”Not really.”Wang Meilin continued, “This core robot stayed with young master’s mother and grandmother for a day, so it knows them well...” ”

“Hearing this, Duanmu Fengyu’s face was full of disdain. “I only want to hear about young master.” ”

“As long as Zhou Xiang and Bai Tang were two low-level Earthlings, Duanmu Fengyu didn’t want to waste a minute on them. ”

“So what if they were Cen Shaoqing’s mother and grandmother? In the end, they were still abandoned by others! ”

“In Duanmu Fengyu’s eyes, Zhou Xiang and Old Lady Cen were tools to give birth! ”

“Pitiful, pathetic. ”

“Therefore, she had to give birth to a child that belonged to her. She did not want to devote her entire life to someone else’s child. ”

“Wang Meilin said, “There’s no news on young master’s side for the time being.” ”

Duanmu Feng narrowed her eyes. “Do you know anything about that Earthling?”

“Who?”Wang Meilin was slightly stunned.

“Duanmu feng continued, “She wants a woman who can soar to the heavens in one go!” ”

Wang Meilin immediately realized that Duanmu Fengyu was referring to the girlfriend of the young master of Dongli.

“Upon hearing this, Wang Meilin asked, “Miss, do you want to check?” ”

“Yes.”Duanmu fengyu nodded.

She originally didn’t want to bother with that cannon fodder.

“However, it was very likely that the cannon fodder would give birth to a future young master in the future. ”

“Therefore, she needed to know the other party’s identity in advance. ”

“That way, it would be easier for her to act. ”

“”Alright.”Wang Meilin seemed to have thought of something, then, she said, “Oh right, Miss, I heard that the woman from Earth seems to be very powerful. Before the young master knew her, he had been eating vegetarian and chanting Buddhism. Even the Grand Tutor was worried that he might really become a monk until... ... ...” ”

Duanmu fengyu also knew a little about this matter.

But she never took it to heart.

“After all, not everyone could be compared to her. ”

“The reason why the young master of Dongli did not fall in love and wanted to become a monk was because he wanted to. Now, he suddenly did not want to believe in Buddhism. Coincidentally, at the most critical moment, that woman appeared. ”

Everyone thought that it was that woman who changed the young master of Dongli.

“In fact, they were thinking too much. ”

The young master of Dongli was a dragon among men. How could he be influenced by a woman?

“”Don’t worry about that.”Duanmu fengyu continued, “Find out who that woman is and place a few core robots by her side. I’ll tell you what happens next.” ”

“In fact, what happened next was very simple. ”

Make that woman infertile!

“”Miss, this...”Wang Meilin said with some difficulty, “The grand tutor is very secretive. He might not be able to find out for a while.” ”

It was probably to prevent someone from making things difficult for her.

“Therefore, the grand tutor ”

“Duanmu Feng narrowed her eyes. “As long as you put your heart into it, there’s nothing in this world that you can’t do!” ” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Yes!”Wang Meilin immediately stood up straight.

“Duanmu fengyu immediately said, “I don’t want to hear any explanations. I just want to see the results.” ”

Duanmu Fengyu was so determined that Wang Meilin could only bite the bullet and nod.

Who asked her to have such a Master?

It seemed that she could only slowly think of a way.

“Duanmu Fengyu closed her eyes and said, “Alright. You can go out first.” ”

“”Okay, call me if you need anything. I’ll go out first.”Wang Meilin bent her back and walked out. ”

“After Wang Meilin left, Duanmu Fengyu also went outside and coincidentally bumped into Mrs. Duanmu who was returning from her trip. ”

“Duanmu Fengyu immediately went up to greet her. “Mom, where did you go?” ”

“Mrs. Duanmu left very early in the morning. She yawned and said, “I went to your aunt’s place.” ”

“After all, Duanmu Fengfei was the wife of the Chief Alliance. She had a lot of things to deal with, so she couldn’t meet her whenever she wanted to. ”

Even Mrs. Duanmu’s sister-in-law had to meet her on the appointed day.

Today was not the day to meet Duanmu Fengfei.

“Why are you going to my aunt’s Place?”Duanmu Fengyu asked.
