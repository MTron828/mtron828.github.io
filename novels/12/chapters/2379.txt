Yes.

“As long as Lin Ze could forgive her, she could abandon everything. ”

“Facing a person like Bai Mo, Lin Ze was speechless. “I’ve said what I needed to say. Since you’re Shameless, there’s nothing I can do about it.” ”

A person who was shameless was invincible in the world.

Lin Ze really had no way of dealing with such a person.

“Bai Mo looked at Lin Ze and said, “You’re not saying what you mean. You clearly have me in your heart! “Lin Ze, I regret it now. I regret it very much. I regret why I rejected you in the first place. If I hadn’t rejected you, would I be the one with you now?” ”

It was all because of Bai Jingshu.

Bai Mo’s hatred for Bai Jingshu had reached its peak.

He wished he could kill Bai Jingshu right away.

“Lin Ze was about to leave, but when he heard Bai Mo’s words, he couldn’t help but turn around and continue, “Even if you didn’t reject me back then, I would have rejected you as well. You were the one who thought too highly of yourself. I was with Jingshu because I loved her and had nothing to do with anyone else, especially you!” ”

“After saying this, Lin Ze walked straight to the front of the car, opened the driver’s seat door, and sat inside. ”

Dust rose in the air.

“Soon, the silver-gray car disappeared in front of them. ”

“Bai Mo watched as the car disappeared in front of them. Her eyes were filled with sorrow, and her heart was filled with pain. ”

The silver-gray car soon arrived at the Lin family manor.

Lin Ze took off his suit jacket and handed it to the maid. “Where’s Miss Bai?”

“The maid took the jacket and said respectfully, “Miss Bai has already left.” ”

Lin Ze nodded.

“His wedding with Bai Jingshu on Earth was scheduled for the 26th. Everything that needed to be prepared was almost ready. Now, he just needed to wait quietly for the wedding to arrive. ”

“”Ah Ze!”Just then, ye Shu walked in from outside. ”

“Mom.”Lin Ze looked up at Ye Shu.

“Ye Shu continued, “Ah Ze, cousin Jingshu is here today.” ”

Lin Ze frowned slightly. “It’s Bai Mo. .”

“Ye Shu nodded. “Yes, it’s called Bai Mo. . But Jingshu said that this Bai Mo doesn’t have any good intentions. She even went on a blind date with you before, right?” ”

“Yes.”Lin Ze nodded.

“Ye Shu continued, “You have to be careful. I heard from Jingshu that Bai Mo isn’t a good person. You Can’t be fooled by her.” ”

“Ever since the incident with Zhang Qingqing, Ye Shu felt that Lin Ze was easier to fool. ”

She was a little worried about Lin Ze.

“”Don’t worry, I know,”Lin ze said. ”

Ye Shu nodded and smiled. “Hurry up and wash your hands. It’s time to eat.”

“Did Jingshu go back?”Lin Ze asked.

“”She went back. She said that the publishing company had something to talk to her about,”ye Shu replied. ”

“OH.”Lin Ze turned around to wash his hands.

Ye Zao was also at home today.

It was very rare for her to play with her phone while eating. The corners of her mouth were slightly curved.

“Ye Shu asked curiously, “Zao, what are you smiling about? Why Are You So Happy?” ”

Ye Zao put down his phone. “It’s a funny video.”

“Lin Ze continued, “It’s from fifth brother, right?” ”

“Smart.”Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly.

“Lin Ze ate a mouthful of vegetables and asked curiously, “When are you two going to do something?” ”

“No Rush.”Ye Zao’s tone was indifferent.

“Lin Ze smiled and said, “Even a certain someone is not in a rush?” ”

“As a man, he knew Cen Shaoqing too well. ”

“Although he could not bear to part with his sister, Lin Ze still felt a little sympathy for Cen Shaoqing. ”

A man in his thirties who was still a vegetarian was indeed a little miserable.

“Hmm...”ye Zhuo hesitated for a moment. “He shouldn’t be in a hurry either.”

Lin Ze chuckled and ate a mouthful of vegetables. He did not say anything else.

“Ye Shu said, “Zhuo Zhuo, Shaoqing is not young anymore. Don’t be too considerate.” ”

“”Mom,”ye Zhuo turned to look at Ye Shu. “Am I your biological daughter or is he your biological son?” ”

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “He’s my biological son-in-law.” ”

“After saying that, ye Shu continued, “Zhuo Zhuo, I’m serious. You Can’t make things too difficult for Shaoqing. Shaoqing is an honest child and doesn’t talk much. Don’t bully him all the time.” ”

“Hearing that, Ye Zhuo looked at ye Shu in disbelief, “Mom, who are you calling honest? Cen Shaoqing?” ” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“As expected, when a mother-in-law looked at her son-in-law, the more she looked at him, the more she liked him. Ye Zhuo didn’t expect that Cen Shaoqing would leave ye Shu with an honest image. ”

“”That’s right. Is Shaoqing not honest?”Ye Shu continued, “You see, every time he hits you, he doesn’t fight back. He doesn’t even return the scolding. If it wasn’t because he likes you, who could do this?” ”

“Ye Zao took a bite of the pudding. “Mom, then you really don’t know that Mr. Cen.” ”
