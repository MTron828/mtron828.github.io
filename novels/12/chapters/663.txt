“Ye Zhuo suddenly called Xu Lanyue over and said a bunch of strange words. Although Aunt Zhang did not know what ye Zhuo’s ultimate goal was, she knew that she could not let ye Zhuo continue speaking. ”

She had to stop ye Zhuo immediately!

“Ye Zhuo turned to look at Aunt Zhang, the corners of his mouth curling into a faint smile. “You keep calling her Miss Qianhua. Does this mean that you are not prepared to acknowledge your own biological daughter?” ”

Aunt Zhang’s expression changed when she heard this. “What biological daughter? What nonsense are you talking about?”

Feng Qianhua’s heart skipped a beat. She took a step back and tried her best to look as if there was nothing wrong with her. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

The smile on Ye Zhuo’s face did not diminish as he spoke slowly.

“”Aunt Zhang, oh no! I should call you aunt Xu. Your real name is Xu Lanying, and you’re Xu Lanyue’s biological sister.” ”

“”Forty years ago, you used some means to get to know Old Master Feng, and you secretly had a child with old master Feng. Ten months later, you gave birth to Feng Qianhua. “You wanted to use a daughter to get to the top, but Old Madam Feng is not a vegetarian. She would rather accept an illegitimate daughter than divorce old master Feng. She also found someone to suppress you. Under all kinds of pressure, you had no choice but to fake your death to avoid the rumors. You changed your name to Zhang Lan and lived under the sun again.” ”

“”Nineteen years later, Feng Qianhua reached the marriageable age. For the sake of your biological daughter being able to marry into the Lin family, you came to the Lin family under the name of Zhang Lan to be a helper. Step by step, you gained my grandmother’s trust. In the end, you became my grandmother’s personal helper. You said all the good things about Feng Qianhua in front of my grandmother, and you successfully made my grandmother accept Feng Qianhua ”

“”Unfortunately, things didn’t go my way! “Not long after, my father met my mother and had me and my brother. When Feng Qianhua learned of this, she was both angry and jealous! “So, the two of you colluded in secret. On the night my mother gave birth, you used your sister Xu Lanyue’s position as an obstetrician to successfully swap Mu Yourong and me! In order to prevent things from changing, you even fed me, who had just been born, a psychoactive drug called piperazine. Once I took this drug, it would cause a neurological disorder! Because of this, I was cursed as an idiot for nineteen years ”

“”After you swapped Mu Yourong and me, you deliberately labeled my mother as a fickle woman in front of my father! You also deliberately guided her in front of my grandmother. Fraternal twins can have different fathers!” ”

“Speaking up to this point, Ye Zhuo turned to look at Feng Qianhua and continued: ”

“”Oh right, there’s also my father’s car accident. Why did my father get into a car accident on the way to Yunjing? “This was also your doing. You tampered with the brakes, and the brakes failed, causing my father to crash into the car in front of him. Not only did the car accident cause my father to lose a leg, but it also caused my father to lie in bed for ten years.” ”

“Actually, when she investigated the car accident that happened in Lin Jin city, Ye Zhuo was also very surprised. ”

She did not expect that the car accident in Lin Jin city was also Feng Qianhua’s doing.

Hearing this.

Ye Shu’s emotions immediately broke down and she burst into tears.

She did not expect that it was Feng Qianhua who did not wait for Lin Jin city to give birth.

“She also did not expect that Feng Qianhua not only swapped ye Zao and Mu Yourong, but also poisoned the newborn ye Zao. ”

Ye Shu had never understood why ye Zao had such a big change. Now she finally understood.

It turned out that she had been fed medicine since she was young.

“Feng Qianhua! You are so heartless! Why do you treat US Like This!”

Lin Jincheng was also stunned. He clenched his fists tightly and his entire body was trembling. The way he looked at Feng Qianhua was filled with extreme hatred.

It was his fault!

It was all his fault!

“If he had sensed Feng Qianhua’s wolf-like ambition earlier, the family of four would not have suffered so much. They would not have let ye Shu and ye Zhuo suffer nineteen years of grievances. ”

Lin Jincheng blamed himself endlessly.

“”Shut up! You Shut Up! I don’t know what you’re talking about!”Feng Qianhua grabbed old madam Lin’s arm tightly, she said in a panic, “Aunt Lin, don’t believe them! They’re talking nonsense! I didn’t do this at all!” ”

“Old Madam Lin also did not believe that Feng Qianhua was such a person. Feng Qianhua had given her nineteen years of health-preserving soup, so she would not be deceived by ye Zhuo’s one-sided words. ”

She was not a fool!

“Moreover, she had known madam Feng for so many years, but she had never heard that Feng Qianhua was the illegitimate daughter of Old Feng. ”
