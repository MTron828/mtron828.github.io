“If he ziteng had listened to his parents earlier, things would not have turned out this way. ”

“He ziteng nodded. “I understand, sister-in-law.” ”

...

“On the other side, after Xu Yao was brought to the detention center, she had a miscarriage due to her amniocentesis and was rushed to the hospital. ”

“Initially, Xu Yao had hoped to escape with her pregnancy. ”

But now...

The child was gone and so was her trump card.

What should she do now?

No.

She had to escape immediately.

“Hence, when the police officers were not paying attention, Xu Yao quietly slipped away. ”

Xu Yao came all the way to Xu Chaonan’s office building and quietly ran to Xu Chaonan’s office.

“Auntie!”

“When he saw Xu Yao, Xu Chaonan was shocked. ”

“”Yaoyao, you... Why are you here?” ”

“Xu Yao cried and knelt down to Xu Chaonan. “Auntie, you have to save me! Only you can save me now!” ”

“Did you escape from the detention center?”Xu Chaonan frowned.

“From the beginning, Xu Chaonan knew that Xu Yao would not have a good ending. ”

She had advised Xu Yao not to go down this path more than once.

But Xu Yao had turned a deaf ear to it.

“Initially, Xu Chaonan thought that Xu Yao would at most be dumped by HE ziteng. He did not expect that she would actually throw herself into it! ”

“Xu Yao’s future was originally bright, but now it was dark. ”

“Xu Chaonan held Xu Yao’s hand, “Quickly follow me to the detention center and take the initiative to admit your mistake. According to your current crime, you are at most an accomplice. You will be able to get out after a few years of rehabilitation. If you escape, then it won’t be a matter of years!” ”

“Xu Yao cried and shook her head, “I don’t want to go, I don’t want to. Aunt, please find some connections to send me overseas! I beg you, you only have me as your niece. Do you have the heart to watch me go to jail?” ”

“Xu Chao Nan frowned and hesitated for a moment before continuing, “Go to the resting room to wash your face and rest well. I will arrange the rest.” ”

“Hearing this, Xu Yao immediately wiped her tears and smiled, “Thank you, Auntie. Thank you, Auntie!” ”

She knew that Xu Chaonan would definitely save her.

“After all, she was Xu Chaonan’s only niece. ”

Xu Chaonan brought Xu Yao to the resting room to rest.

“After washing her face, Xu Yao looked at Xu Chaonan and said, “Auntie, I’m a little hungry.” ”

“”What do you want to eat? I’ll give you some,”Xu Chaonan said. ”

“The detention center was not a place for people to stay. Every day, it was just boiled cabbage and potatoes. Xu Yao ordered a lot of food in one go. ”

“Half an hour later, Xu Chaonan brought the food that Xu Yao ordered to the lounge. ”

“Smelling the fragrance in the air, Xu Yao swallowed her saliva. Before Xu Chaonan could put down the lunchbox, she could not wait to snatch the lunchbox from Xu Chaonan’s hands and start wolfing down the food. ”

“Xu Chaonan saw this and felt pain in his heart. No matter what, Xu Yao was a child that she had watched grow up. ”

“Xu Yao had been pampered since she was young, so she had never experienced such hardship. ”

“Seeing Xu Yao like this, Xu Chaonan said, “Eat slowly. No one is going to snatch it from you.” ”

“Although Xu Yao nodded, she didn’t slow down. ”

“After eating and drinking her fill, Xu Yao fell asleep on the bed. ”

This was the first good sleep she had in so many days. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

She did not want to go back to the detention center.

“Xu Chaonan quietly walked out of the lounge and walked to the floor-to-ceiling window of the office. He looked down at the traffic on the road. Finally, he took out his phone and made a call, “Hello, is this the Public Security Bureau? I am Xu Yao’s aunt, Xu Chaonan. You Don’t have to look for me. Xu Yao is with me now. The address is 1024 MENGHAI road, building A. I will arrange for my secretary to meet you downstairs.” ”
