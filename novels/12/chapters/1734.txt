“Chapter 1735: 358: honestly, I’m from 200 years later, the jealous Fifth Master! 3”

Translator: 549690339

Just like Cen Shaoqing before this.

He had never known that this was how it felt to love someone.

Marry into the family?

Ye Zhuo did not expect Cen Shaoqing to be able to say these two words. “I realize that your skin is really getting thicker.”

“CEN shaoqing calmly replied, “This is what I call a married couple.” ”

“”Be serious,”ye zhuo continued, “Honestly, how did you know that I came from the future?” ”

Cen Shaoqing happily twirled the Buddhist beads. “Because you said so.”

“Ye Zhuo was always in the base, saying that she was not from this era. Although no one had ever taken her words seriously, Cen Shaoqing knew that ye Zhuo was not joking. ”

She did indeed come from the future world.

Her personality was very different from the rumored Mu Zao.

“After a while, CEN Shaoqing continued, “Leader, tell me about your future world. Also, how did you come to this world?” ”

“Ye Zao nodded slightly and leaned on Cen Shaoqing’s shoulder, talking about their world. ”

The Earth two hundred years later was no longer the Earth of today.

“Trees were cut down excessively, the area of vegetation was gradually reduced, the air was polluted with unprecedented pollution, the destruction of the ozone layer seriously led to global warming, polar bears, penguins and other animals had long been extinct. ”

“Not only animals, there were also many humans who died because of the high temperature. ”

“Ye Zao spoke seriously, and Cen Shaoqing also listened attentively. ”

“”So, when developing scientific and technological civilization, protecting the ecological environment is also very important. Perhaps only those who have experienced this kind of feeling will understand,”ye Zao continued, “If I hadn’t returned to two hundred years later, I would never have believed that the earth was so beautiful.” ”

“Before she had transmigrated, ye Zhuo had once suspected that the history books were exaggerating the beauty of Earth. ”

It was only until now that ye Zhuo realized that the evidence in the history books was not exaggerating the facts.

The past of Earth was even more beautiful than described in the history books!

“Unfortunately, the people in the future would no longer be able to appreciate this kind of beauty! ”

“Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly and continued, “Then how did you come to this world?” ”

“”Because of an accident,”ye Zao said, “I was conducting experiments with a few students on the space station when an explosion suddenly occurred. When I woke up, I became Mu Zao.”After understanding his own situation.., ye Zao quickly made a choice. He left the Mu family and returned to Ye Shu’s side. At that time, Ye Zao’s thought was that since she had taken over the body of the original owner, she would definitely be filial to the original owner and improve the living conditions of the original owner’s mother. ”

“As time passed, Ye Zao gradually adapted to this new identity. Soon, she got used to having a mother, an uncle, and then her brother and father... ! ... because of these people, she gained family, friendship, and love. Many times, ye Zao forgot that she came from another world! ” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“”Accident?”Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly. “It shouldn’t be that simple, right?”With Ye Zao’s reputation and status at that time, there should be many people who coveted her. Therefore, this was definitely not an accident! It was intentional. ”

“Ye Zao continued, “I also feel that it’s not that simple, but I have no way to investigate it now.”He did not know how her world was now. ”

Different dimensions led to different times.

“She had spent more than three years here. In her world, who knew how many years had passed. ”

Ten years?

Or twenty years?

“Could it be someone by your side?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“The laboratory was in outer space. Unless there was a mole by ye Zao’s side, there would definitely not be an explosion. ”

Ye Zao frowned slightly. “Probably not.”

“At that time, those who were in the laboratory were ye Zao’s most trusted confidants. They were friends who had been through life and death. Ye Zao believed that they would not betray her. ”

“Other than them, who else had the ability to blow up the laboratory? Moreover, it was in a situation where no one would know. ”

“Don’t think too much.”Cen Shaoqing put his arm around her shoulder and hugged her tightly. “You have me in the future.”

“No matter what, he would never betray her. ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “Oh right, leader, do you want to go back and take a look?” ”

“”I thought about it before, but I don’t think about it now.”Ye Zhuo continued, “And this kind of thing is not something that I can accomplish just by thinking about it.” ”

“The future world was so developed, but they had not been able to develop a space-time shuttle, let alone now. ”

“In fact, ye Zao has studied space-time shuttles. ”
