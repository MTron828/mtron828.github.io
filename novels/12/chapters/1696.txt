Translator: 549690339

Number Input?

“Tao Lin raised his head to look at Ye Zao, his eyes already showing some impatience. “Could it be that your name is a string of numbers?” ”

“Input it.”Ye Zao’s eyes were clear.

“It was a very light voice, but Tao Lin’s entire body trembled when he heard it. It was a very strange feeling, making people subconsciously not dare to refute her words. Tao Lin continued, “056189, right?” ”

“Yes.”

Tao Lin entered the number into the computer and then clicked search.

The computer screen quickly turned to another screen.

“Looking at the information displayed, Tao Lin was immediately stunned. ”

S 3?

“On the day that Tao Lin entered the job, he had received formal training, so he naturally knew what s 3 represented. ”

“But he had been on duty for so many years, but he had never seen anyone with an S 3 identity in real life! ”

Tao Lin raised his head and looked at Ye Zhuo.

“The little girl looked about eighteen or nineteen years old. She was not old, but her entire body exuded a powerful aura. ”

This was something that girls her age did not have.

“There was no way to imitate it, and there was no way to copy it. ”

Could it be that she was really an S 3?

No.

No Way?

Could it be that the system made a mistake?

“Tao Lin closed the web page and entered the search system again, but the results were still the same. ”

S 3!

It really was S 3.

“At this moment, Tao Lin’s legs were shaking, and he almost couldn’t stand properly. He gulped and walked straight to the director’s office. ”

“If this little girl in front of him was really s 3, then their institute would be finished! ”

“When he reached the door, Tao Lin Glanced back at ye Zao. ”

The little girl was dressed very simply.

She wore white clothes and black pants. She had bright eyes and white teeth. Her temperament was outstanding.

“If she was really an S3, then it would be too terrifying! ”

In the office.

“Zou’s mother crossed her arms and stood there. She pointed at the director and said, “Then what do you plan to do with ye Zao?” ”

“She paused at this point and continued, “And that Lin Shasha? Why Didn’t You Capture Lin Shasha?” ”

“The director nodded repeatedly, his forehead covered in cold sweat, “Yes, yes, yes. Mrs. Zou, don’t worry. We will definitely follow the rules. We will definitely not let your daughter suffer in vain. As for Lin Shasha, I have already sent people to investigate. Don’t Worry, trust me! I will definitely handle this matter beautifully.” ”

This Mrs. Zou was born into a merchant. She was not someone to be trifled with.

“Moreover, Zou Feifei was their only daughter! ”

“In addition, they had the support of the Wu family, so this matter was even more troublesome. ”

The same went for the two young ladies. They had no choice but to provoke Zou Feifei!

How could zou feifei be so easily trifled with?

This was great!

They had dragged him down with them.

“At this moment, there was a knock on the door. ”

“Knock, Knock, knock — ”

“Hearing the knock on the door, the superintendent heaved a sigh of relief. He cleared his throat and said, “Come in.” ”

Tao Lin pushed the door open and walked in. “Superintendent.”

“Seeing Tao Lin, the superintendent said in surprise, “Tao Lin, why are you here?” ”

Wasn’t he in charge of interrogating ye Zhuo?

He had interrogated him so quickly?

“Tao Lin looked at mother Zou and said, “I have something to report to you.” ”

“Seeing this, mother Zou stood up and looked at director Qian. “Little Qian, then I won’t say anything more to you. You can handle this matter yourself! If you can’t handle it well, I’ll Get Wu Jia Guo to personally send people down to handle it!” ”

“Director Qian’s face turned pale when he heard the last sentence. He immediately smiled and said, “Don’t worry. I definitely won’t trouble director Wu with such a small matter.” ”

“It’s best that way.”Mother Zou glanced at Tao Lin and turned to leave.

“Director Qian heaved a sigh of relief when he saw mother Zou leave. He turned to look at Tao Lin and said, “Do you have anything to report?” ”

“Tao Lin looked at Wu Jianguo and continued, “That ye Zhuo doesn’t seem to be an ordinary person.” ”

Tao Lin didn’t know whether that was s3 or not.

“Director Qian frowned slightly. “Who is she if not an ordinary person?”No matter who it was, offending Zou Feifei wouldn’t bring them any good results! ” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“After saying that, Qian youlong continued, “Moreover, Zou Feifei isn’t an ordinary person. We must give the Zou family an explanation for this matter!” ”

“But...”

“Before Tao Lin could finish his sentence, Qian Youlong continued, “What do you mean by ‘but’! Even if she is the king of heaven, this matter must be handled according to Mrs. Zou’s instructions!” ”

“”I saw the S-3 logo on her identity,”Tao Lin continued. ”

“”What’s wrong with S-3? Can S-3 be superior to others?”Qian Youlong said disdainfully, “You do as I say.” ”

Tao Lin looked at Qian Youlong in surprise.
