Translator: 549690339

Xu Yao’s words finally hit he ziteng’s heart.

Other than ye Zhuo.

It was the first time he had met such a straightforward girl.

“”Actually, I also prefer spicy rice noodles,”he ziteng said. ”

“Really?”Xu Yao said.

“”Of course,”he ziteng continued, “Didn’t I tell you before? I like that family’s rice noodles the most.” ”

“Xu Yao continued, “Then let’s eat this before we go eat the rice noodles?” ”

“He ziteng put down his fork. “Sure, but before we go to the rice noodles shop again, I have something to say.” ”

“”Go ahead,”Xu Yao said. ”

“He ziteng said, “Close your eyes first. Open them when I tell you to.” ”

“Okay.”Xu Yao nodded and slowly closed her eyes.

He ziteng looked at the manager at the side.

The manager immediately understood.

“After about ten seconds, he ziteng looked at Xu Yao and said, “Yaoyao, you can open your eyes now.” ”

“Xu Yao slowly opened her eyes. When she saw the scene in front of her, she was immediately stunned. ”

She saw two waiters pushing a small cart over.

The cart was filled with flowers and flashing colorful lights. In the middle of the flowers was a very beautiful birthday cake.

It was a pure white swan. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

It was so lifelike.

“Although the size was not big, only enough for two people to share, the price was not low, and it was a limited edition. ”

This birthday cake was basically used by rich and noble young masters to propose or confess.

“In the past, Xu Yao had only seen pictures on her moments. She did not expect to finally have the chance to see the real thing today! ”

“If she wasn’t afraid that he ziteng would notice something, Xu Yao would have taken out her phone and taken a photo. ”

Beside the cake was a jewelry box.

“He ziteng picked up the jewelry box and opened the lid. “Yaoyao, I confessed to you once before, but you rejected me that time. Now, can you accept me? I really like you. I really, really like you.” ”

It was the first time in his life that he ziteng was so determined to like someone.

“Xu Yao looked at the necklace that was handed to her and was stunned for a moment. Then, she said, “I, I...” ”

She knew that she could not reject he ziteng anymore.

“If she rejected he ziteng again this time, he would not have the chance. ”

“However, she could not agree to it immediately. ”

“After all, she would not cherish it even if it was too easy to get. ”

She had to let he ziteng see how reserved she was.

“Let me think about it again.”

“He ziteng said, “Yaoyao, you are the first girl that I have taken the initiative to confess to. You are also the first girl that I want to be responsible for. Don’t worry, I will definitely not let you down.” ”

He knew Xu Yao’s views on love.

“Since he had confessed to her again, he was prepared to enter the marriage hall with Xu Yao. ”

Meeting the right person at the right time was a very blissful thing.

“Xu Yao’s eyes reddened slightly. After a moment, she took the jewelry box from he ziteng’s hands with both hands. “Did you mean what you said just now? You will never let me down?” ”

“Yes! I will never let you down!”He ziteng nodded excitedly.

“Xu Yao said, “Okay, then I promise you.” ”

She promised!

Xu Yao promised!

“He ziteng was very excited. He picked Xu Yao up and spun around on the spot. “Yaoyao, thank you.” ”

“Xu Yao said, “You have to remember what you said today.” ”

“”Don’t worry, I will remember it for the rest of my life.” ”

“After a while, he ziteng put Xu Yao down. “Yaoyao, let me put the necklace on you.” ”

“Okay.”Xu Yao nodded.

He ziteng put the necklace on Xu Yao.

“After leaving the Western restaurant, he ziteng drove Xu Yao to eat rice noodles. ”

“Although Xu Yao hated rice noodles, she still pretended to eat happily so that he ziteng wouldn’t see anything. ”

“Halfway through the drink, Xu Yao looked up at He ziteng. “Do you want to drink?” ”

“Yes.”He ziteng nodded. “You want to drink too?”

“”Yes. It’s rare for me to be happy today, but I can only drink a little fruit wine,”Xu Yao said. ”

“He ziteng smiled and said, “Okay. I also saved some wine from the boss earlier.”Although the rice noodle shop was not big, he ziteng was a regular customer and had long become friends with the boss. Therefore, he had saved a lot of famous wine here. ”

“Soon, the boss came over with the wine. ”

“He ziteng was happy today. Under Xu Yao’s guidance, he drank one cup after another. After a while, he was a little dazed and felt like he was stepping on cotton. ”

“Seeing that he was almost done drinking, Xu Yao stood up and said, “Ziteng, it’s late now. Let me send you back.” ”

“”Drink, I still want to drink! I’m Happy Today!” ”
