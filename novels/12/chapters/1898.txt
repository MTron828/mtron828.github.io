“Ye Zao smiled and said, “You can’t force matters of the heart. What’s there to be angry about? Yueyue, what are you thinking about!” ”

“It’s good that you’re not angry.”

...

“After eating, they went out. It was exactly 8 o’clock in the morning. ”

“Although it was morning, the sound of firecrackers outside was incessant. The air was filled with the smell of gunpowder and the thick smell of the new year. ”

Both Yun capital and the capital prohibited the setting off of fireworks. Ye Zao had never experienced such a new year before.

“Li Yueyue walked in front as a tour guide. “Da Zao Zao Zao, I’ll take you guys to participate in the heaven worship ceremony first. Then, we’ll have a bonfire dance at night.” ”

“”Okay, sure.”Ye Zao nodded and followed behind Li Yueyue. ”

“This year was the new year on the prairie. The weather was very good. The sky was clear and the sun was shining brightly. Usually, the temperature on the prairie was around-10-20 degrees Celsius, but today, the temperature had actually reached above zero. ”

“The adults and children were all wearing the national costumes, and their faces were beaming with joy. ”

“Soon, they arrived at an open-air square. ”

There were three ancient-style buildings built on the square.

“When everyone saw Li Yueyue coming over, they greeted her warmly, “Yueyue is here.” ”

There were even people who invited Li Yueyue to their home for New Year’s Eve dinner.

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Yueyue, you’re so popular.” ”

“Li Yueyue said, “Do you know why?” ”

“Why?”Ye Zao asked.

“Li Yueyue lowered her voice and said, “Because those three ancestral halls were funded by my father.” ”

“Li Sanzhu had done a lot of good things for the grassland, so everyone was especially warm to the Li clan. ”

“I see.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

The ceremony of worshipping the heavens was very complicated. Those who participated in the ceremony had to kneel three times and kowtow nine times.

“If the high priest in front did not get up, no one else could. ”

“The scene was very solemn. Other than the sound of firecrackers and burning paper money, there was no other sound. ”

“The Li clan had more than a hundred people. When all of them knelt down, it was an exceptionally spectacular sight! ”

Ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing were spectators. They only needed to stand by the side and watch the ceremony. There was no need for them to participate.

These two were dragons and phoenixes among men. They immediately attracted the attention of many people.

“Who is that? How come I’ve never seen him before?”

“I’ve never seen him before either! I heard that he’s a relative of the Yueyue family.”

“He’s too good-looking. Does that young lady have a boyfriend?”

“Look at what you’re asking. They’re obviously a couple!”

“What if they’re brother and sister? How can you be so sure that they’re a couple?”

“That’s impossible. Brother and sister don’t look at each other like that.”

“Family and love were two different things, so their gazes were naturally different. ”

The crowd was discussing animatedly.

The commotion quickly attracted Li Shuyi’s attention.

“Although Li Shuyi was also a member of the Li clan, she wasn’t willing to participate in the heaven worship ceremony with her clansmen. ”

“After all, she had one-fifth of C Nation’s bloodline. ”

She was different from those people.

“No wonder China could not develop. What era was it now, and they were still engaging in such feudal superstitions. It was really pitiful and pathetic. ”

Li Shuyi curled the corners of her lips. She looked up and saw a side profile that was stunning.

“The man looked sideways at the girl beside him. The bridge of his nose was tall, and his pair of phoenix-shaped eyes were slightly raised. They were deep and bottomless. He wore black clothing that reached to his ankles, and an invisible powerful aura erupted from him. ”

Who Was This?

“Li Shuyi was stunned for a moment, and then she realized that he might be a poor relative of Li Yueyue’s family. ”

What a pity!

A poor relative who could not make a name for himself actually looked so exquisite and had an aura.

“Li Shuyi had seen many handsome men in the country and abroad, but so far, she had not seen anyone who could surpass this man in front of her! ”

Handsome was handsome.

“Unfortunately, he was too poor. ” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Li Shuyi didn’t want to learn from her mother, Linda. She didn’t want to help the poor with precision. ”

“Her man either wore a military uniform to protect his home and country on the frontier battlefield, or he wore a suit in his office to strategize! ”

“Thinking of this, Li Shuyi withdrew her gaze and no longer looked over there. ”

“”Shuyi.”At this moment, Ai Ru walked over. ”

“Ai Ru.”Li Shuyi looked back.

Ai Ru walked over and held Li Shuyi’s arm. “It’s so lively here today.”It was also Ai Ru’s first time celebrating the new year on the prairie.

“En.”Li Shuyi nodded. “Today is the most lively day of the year.”

“There was almost no free time on the prairie. All year round, she was busy herding sheep and cattle. Other than this season, she basically didn’t come back at all. ”

“With a glance, AI ru seemed to have seen something. Her gaze changed, and her eyes were filled with disbelief. ”
