Translator: 549690339

Xu Chaonan was swift and decisive in his business. He was a true self-made man.

Many men were very impressed by her!

“After saying that, Liu Zetian continued, “In any case, you have to be careful. Just don’t be deceived by others.” ”

“”Okay, got it,”he ziteng said. ”

“”Okay, that’s it then. I’ll hang up first.” ”

“After hanging up, he ziteng sent a message to ye Zao. ”

“[ goddess, I found a girlfriend! ] ”

“Ye Zao did not reply immediately. After ten minutes, he sent a message. [ Congratulations. ] ”

[ thank you! ]

Time passed quickly.

“In the blink of an eye, two days had passed. ”

Today was the day that ye Zao and Cen Shaoqing went to the grassland for a vacation.

“At eight o’clock in the morning, the two of them pulled their suitcases and arrived at the CEN family’s private airport. ”

The Cen family’s airport was very large.

There were a total of three planes parked there.

“One was old Mrs. Cen, one was Cen Shaoqing, and the other was used to transport fresh seasonal vegetables. ”

The other one was driven away by Zhou Xiang.

“”Fifth master, Miss Ye.” ”

“The two of them had just entered the parking lot when the captain, deputy captain, and three or four flight attendants came out to welcome them. ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “Is everything ready?”

“The airport said respectfully, “Don’t worry, everything is ready. It will take a total of five hours and 30 minutes to fly to the grassland of Hu City.” ”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing then nodded.

“Ye Zhuo looked at the huge plane, deep in thought. ”

“It was a pity that the light-speed aircraft had limited energy and could only fly to the major planets. Otherwise, it would only take a blink of an eye to go to the grassland of Hu City. ”

The two of them walked into the cabin.

Ye Zao picked a seat by the window. “Let’s sit here.”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing didn’t have any objections.

“The private plane was very spacious. Not only could they sit, but they could also lie down. ”

“The cabin was even equipped with a bar, a restaurant, and a billiard room. ”

Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddha beads and sat opposite ye Zao.

The stewardess walked over and poured water for the two of them.

Cen Shaoqing looked up slightly. “Two cups of black tea and one set of cookies.”

“”Okay, please wait a moment.” ”

Ye Zao put down his phone and looked at Cen Shaoqing. “What are cookies? Are they delicious?”

“She had eaten a lot of desserts, but this was the first time she had heard of cookies. ”

“It sounded very simple, but it did not make one have an appetite. ”

“”The taste is not bad. It’s a specialty of Jianzhou. You can try it later,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Soon, the stewardess came over with the cookies and black tea. ”

“Not only did the cookies have an ordinary name, but their appearance was also very ordinary. ”

They were beige in color with a faint burnt yellow at the edges.

“Ye Zhuo said, “This is the cookie?” ”

“CEN shaoqing nodded slightly, “Yes.” ”

“”It doesn’t look very delicious,”ye Zao said as he picked up the cookie and stuffed it into his mouth. Soon, the expression in his eyes changed from indifference to surprise! ”

“He didn’t expect that the cookie, which looked ordinary, would taste so good. ”

“The taste was very sweet, but it was not greasy at all. It was the kind that got more fragrant the more one chewed it. There was also a faint fragrance in the taste. ”

“It was like an osmanthus, but also like a rose. It spread from the mouth to the nasal cavity and did not disappear for a long time. ”

“After eating a mouthful of the cookies, he drank a mouthful of rich black tea. The feeling was simply too good! ”

Ye Zao sighed softly. “The cookies are really delicious. The black tea is also very fragrant.”

“After eating two pieces in a row, just as ye Zao was about to take the third piece, Cen Shaoqing reached out and held her hand. “You can only eat two pieces today.” ”

“Why?”Ye Zao asked.

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “Because you ate all of today’s amount yesterday.” ” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Sweets were too high in sugar. Eating too much was not good for the body. The average sugar intake of the Chinese people was about 50 grams per day.

Cen Shaoqing then made a custom plan for ye Zao.

He could not eat more than 120 grams of sugar per day.

Ye Zao especially liked to eat sweets. He could not move around when he saw delicious sweets. He had eaten so many sweets in one go yesterday. He had long exceeded the limit!

“Ye Zao was so hungry that he stretched out a finger. “One, I’ll eat the last one.” ”

“No.”Cen Shaoqing shook his head and turned to look at the air stewardess beside him. “Take this away.”

“”Okay, please wait a moment.”The air stewardess walked over and took away the remaining desserts. ”

“Looking at the desserts that were taken away, ye Zao felt a little uncomfortable. “Cen Shaoqing, you’re too heartless!”Seeing delicious desserts that could not be eaten, he could only watch as they were taken away by others. This feeling was too uncomfortable! ”

“Cen Shaoqing asked someone to bring a plate of desserts and smiled. “I am responsible for you. Come, Try This.” ”
