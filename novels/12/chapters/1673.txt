“”Didn’t you ask me to go back and ask my parents yesterday? Now they have agreed to let me be the person-in-charge of the OASIS project.” Yu Zifei placed a piece of paper on the table and continued, “This is the consent form signed by my parents.” ”

“Ye Zhuo picked up the consent form and said with a smile, “Alright, from now on, you are one of the people-in-charge of the OASIS Project!” ”

“”One of them?”Yu Zifei asked curiously, “Is there anyone else?” ”

“Ye Zhuo said, “Cen Hai.” ”

“Cen Hai has also applied?”Yu Zifei asked.

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Yu Zifei nodded. “Oh, I see. Then, apart from us, is there anyone else who will go with us?” ”

“Ye Zhuo said, “Apart from the 300 technicians, it will be you, Cen Hai, and worker Xu.” ”

“”Okay.”Yu Zifei continued, “Then when do we set off?” ”

“”Three days later,”ye Zao said. ”

“Yu Zifei nodded. “Alright. If there’s nothing else, then I’ll leave first, Miss Ye.” ”

“Okay.”

“After taking a few steps, Yu Zifei turned back, looking like he wanted to say something but hesitated. ”

Ye Zao looked up slightly. “Do you have anything else?”

“Yu Zifei scratched his head and continued, “Miss Ye, are you really not going to land on Europa?” ”

“”Yes.”Ye Zao looked serious. “The environment on Europa is definitely not as simple as what we can observe with our naked eyes. If we forcefully land on Europa, we will regret it later.” ”

“On the surface, Europa was indeed the second small earth. ”

“However, everything could not be seen on the surface. ”

“Yu Zifei continued, “I think Professor Feng and director Ma have been studying Europa all their lives. If we don’t go, they will definitely not be able to accept it in a short period of time.” ”

Professor Feng and director Ma had indeed put in a lot of effort for Europa.

“Ye Zao’s red lips parted slightly. “If you can’t accept it in a short period of time, then learn to accept it slowly.” ”

Ye Zao had already told director Ma and Professor Feng about the various issues at stake. The rest of the questions needed to be slowly digested by them.

“”Miss Ye, What’s on Europa?”Yu Zifei asked. ”

“”Viruses and exotic beasts,”ye Zao continued, “Although Europa looks beautiful on the surface, in fact, this is all an illusion created by the virus. “Humans rely on breathing oxygen to survive on earth, but not every creature needs to breathe oxygen. The exotic beasts on Europa are non-breathing creatures. Not only do they have a strong territorial awareness, but they also have an attack power that exceeds the limits of humans. If we forcefully land, we will be controlled by the exotic beasts. At that time, facing humans will be a disaster!” ”

Yu Zifei frowned deeply and firmly believed ye Zao’s words.

No Wonder Ye Zao never agreed to Professor Feng and director Ma logging on Europa.

“”I see.”Yu Zifei looked up at Ye Zao. “Miss Ye, I believe that Professor Feng and director Ma would understand if they knew about this.” ”

Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“Then I’ll take my leave first.”

“After leaving ye Zhuo’s office, Yu Zifei went to Professor Feng’s office. ”

The Yu family was somewhat related to professor Feng.

“Yu Zifei didn’t want professor Feng to have a knot in his heart, and she didn’t want Professor Feng to have anything to do with ye Zhuo because of this. ”

“Professor Feng sat at his desk. When he saw Yu Zifei come over, he asked with a smile, “Why is Zifei Here?” ”

“Yu Zifei walked over. “Auntie Feng, I’ve already applied with Miss Ye to become the person-in-charge of the OASIS project.” ”

“”Is that so? Congratulations.”Professor Feng continued, “Take a seat! You must be here for something, right?” ”

“”Yes.”Yu Zifei leaned over and sat on the chair, she continued, “Auntie Feng, I know that you’ve always wanted to land on Europa. I’ve already asked Miss Ye just now. She said that Europa is very dangerous. Not only are there viruses, but there are also exotic beasts. If they’re controlled by exotic beasts, it’ll be a disaster for humans!” ”

Professor Feng had a smile on his face the whole time as he looked at Yu Zifei.

He didn’t say anything.

“Yu Zifei continued, “So, Auntie Feng, there’s a reason why Miss Ye didn’t let us land on Europa. Don’t misunderstand Miss Ye.” ”

“The smile on Professor Feng’s face didn’t change as he continued, “Zifei, I understand what you mean, and I also understand Miss Ye’s painstaking efforts. Don’t worry, I Won’t blame Miss Ye.” ”

There were viruses and exotic beasts?

How was that possible! Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

These were obviously words that ye Zhuo used to fool people.
