Translator: 549690339

“These words made sense. After all, Ye Zhuo and ye Han were indeed close siblings in the past. ”

“After saying that, Qiu di looked at his assistant. “Go and call Wu Han over.” ”

“Yes.”The assistant nodded.

“Very soon, Ye Han arrived. ” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Facing Qiu Di, Ye Han was still extremely loyal. “Eldest miss.” ”

“Autumn flute looked at ye Han and continued, “Tell them if what I said just now is true.” ”

“Ye Han was just about to respond, but at this moment, a fierce pain came from his left head. ”

“In an instant, his face turned white. ”

“His body was unstable, and cold sweat appeared on his forehead almost within a few seconds. ”

Countless memory fragments flashed through ye Han’s mind.

“”Sister, Happy Birthday!” ”

“”You don’t have a home, and I don’t have a home either. In the future, you’ll follow me, and we’ll form a family.” ”

“What’s Your Name?”

“I don’t have a name.”

“Then you’ll be called Ye Han from now on.”

“Yeah! I have a name! My Name Is Ye Han!”

“Ye Han pressed his head, trying his best not to faint on the ground. He remembered, he remembered everything. ”

“He remembered, his name was not Wu Han, he was ye Han. ”

His sister was Ye Zhuo.

“Seeing that ye Han did not speak for a long time, Qiu di frowned slightly and continued, “Wu Han.” ”

Wu Han?

“Along with this voice, Ye Han also remembered his experiences during this period of time. ”

Qiu Di.

The Great Witch Doctor.

The six clan leaders.

And Ye Lan.

These people all betrayed ye Zhuo.

He couldn’t forget the last scene when he saw ye Zao.

“”Autumn Flute!”Ye Han directly took out the emei thorn from his waist and stabbed towards the direction of the autumn flute, “Return my sister’s Life!” ”

Autumn flute was directly stunned.

Ye Han.

What was going on with Ye Han?

He remembered?

Impossible!

This was impossible!

“Looking at Ye Han rushing over, autumn flute lost its reaction and just stood there. ”

This scene also stunned everyone below the stage.

What kind of situation was this?

Bang!

“Right at this moment, ye Han’s Emei Thorn was hit to the ground, making a crisp sound. ”

“The sixth elder appeared out of nowhere and blocked in front of Qiu di, “Ye Han! Are You Crazy!” ”

“”Traitor!”Ye Han had just regained consciousness, and his physical strength had not completely recovered. His head was still a little dizzy, “Just by being righteous, this day next year will be the anniversary of your death. I want you to pay Miss Ye back with your life!” ”

“The sixth tribe leader narrowed his eyes. It looked like ye Han had already regained consciousness. In the next second, he directly attacked and fought with Ye Han. ”

The Great Witch Doctor was also hiding in the middle of the crowd.

“Seeing this scene, he turned the ring on his finger. ”

This change was outside of his expectations.

He did not expect that ye Han would suddenly regain consciousness.

Could it be that the Gu worm in ye Han’s body had already been removed?

No.

Impossible!

This kind of extremely yin gu worm could only be removed by the purple leaf flower.

“Without the purple leaf flower, even if ye Zhuo was resurrected, he would not be able to remove it. ”

Resurrected?

“Thinking of this term, the great witch doctor’s expression changed again. ”

Could it be...

That Ye Zhuo had resurrected?

“However, now was not the time for him to think too much. ”

He had to first stabilize the current situation.

The Great Witch Doctor took out a small medicine bottle from his pocket and poured out a black insect from the bottle.

“After coming into contact with the air, the insect mutated and quickly grew a pair of transparent wings from its back. ”

The Great Witch Doctor flicked his finger.

The insect flew out.

“In a moment, the great witch doctor pressed the communicator on his waist. ”

Autumn flute received the great witch doctor’s signal and looked up. He saw the great witch doctor who was as calm as usual.

“Seeing the great witch doctor being so calm, autumn flute also heaved a sigh of relief. ”

“At this moment, the little bug landed beside ye Han’s ear and bit him. ”

“Ye Han’s vision went black, and his attack slowed down. ”

“Taking advantage of this opportunity, the six clan leaders directly controlled ye Han ”

“Ye Han opened his eyes once again. He couldn’t see or hear anything in front of him, as if he was in a state of chaos. ”

“When autumn flute received the Great Witch Doctor’s message, she took a few steps forward and continued, “I’m sorry to have frightened all of you just now! This is the aftereffect of Miss ye changing ye Han’s memories. He has relapsed twice a month now...” ”

“”Nonsense! It’s clearly you guys who controlled ye Han!”Bai changhu continued, “Just now, team leader Ye said that all of you are traitors!” ”

“Autumn Flute’s eyes were red, and she tried her best not to let her tears fall, as if she had been wronged, “I don’t need to say anything about ye Han’s ability, and all of you are very clear about it. Please think carefully. Other than Miss Ye, who else can control ye Han? Who Can Change Ye Han’s memories?” ”

These words made sense.

“In the entire Chang Yue country, other than ye Zhuo, there was probably no other person who could subdue ye Han. ”

“If it wasn’t for Ye Zhuo taking the initiative to make a move, who else could it be? ”

“Who said there wasn’t a second person!”Liu Zhengting seemed to have suddenly recalled something. “The Great Witch Doctor was able to change team leader Ye’s memories! Who knows if you and the Great Witch Doctor were in cahoots!”

“When these words were said, everyone nodded in agreement. ”

“Qiu di continued, “The Great Witch Doctor died long ago! “Mr. Liu, I know that you can’t acknowledge me, and I know that I’m inferior to miss ye, but I will earnestly complete the task that Miss Ye has given me. I will be worthy of the heavens, worthy of the earth, worthy of everyone.” ”

“The six clan leaders said, “Mr. Liu, I’m the same as you. At the beginning, I was also unable to accept Miss Qiu. “As time passes, one can see the hearts of the people. As time passes, you will discover that Miss Qiu is an extremely outstanding person. Her excellence is absolutely not inferior to miss ye! She just lacks the stage to perform! If she really doesn’t have any expertise, do you think that Miss Ye will hand the heavy responsibility to her and hand over the information of the star-crossing case to her as well?” ”

“Speaking up to this point, the six clan leaders lowered their heads to look at the crowd and continued, “As everyone knows, other than the eight great clans and Miss Ye, no one else can open the information of the star-crossing case, but Miss Qiu Can!” ”

“What! Autumn flute can open the information of the star transference case?”

“It can’t be!”

“The crowd below the stage discussed animatedly. The first patriarch frowned slightly, not understanding why the sixth patriarch said this. ”

“After all, they were the ones who gave autumn flute the password to the information of the star transference case. ”

How did it become that autumn flute had the ability to do so when it came to the sixth patriarch?

“The first patriarch was just about to open his mouth to say something when the third patriarch pulled him back. “Big Brother, this is old six’s delaying tactic. If you open your mouth to explain at this time, isn’t it equivalent to adding fuel to the fire?” ”

“Words have no basis. Ask Autumn Flute to open the information on the star-crossing table in public!”

The sixth clan leader immediately got someone to bring over the information on the star-crossing table.

Autumn flute opened it in front of everyone.

Everyone looked at each other. They could see the shock in each other’s eyes.

Could it be...

Autumn flute was really chosen by ye Zao?

Clap Clap Clap —

“At this moment, clapping sounds suddenly appeared in the quiet air. ”

It was a little strange.

The six clan leaders narrowed their eyes. “Who?”

“Ye Zhuo.”
