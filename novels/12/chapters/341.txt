“Chapter 342: 108: The Smart Big Scorch, let’s just break up. CEO’s wife, Chauness! 2”

Translator: 549690339

There must be a reason for this.

“At this moment, Ye Sen could only change the topic with a smile. “SIS, Where’s Scorch?” ”

“Ye Shu said, “She should be in the house. I’ll go get her.” ”

Ye Shu had just stood up from the sofa.

“Speaking of the Devil, the Devil had arrived. ”

“Ye Scorch walked out of the house. “Mom, Uncle.” ”

“As he looked around, he noticed that there was an unfamiliar woman in the room. ”

This is Bai Wei?

Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly.

“Almost like ye Zao, he immediately recalled the scene that happened in the skincare store yesterday. ”

“Ye Sen smiled and introduced ye Zao. “Zao, this is your Aunt Bai. Bai Wei, this is my eldest niece.” ”

“Bai Wei immediately stood up from the sofa. A look of amazement flashed across her eyes. “This is Zao Zao! She’s so beautiful! Hello, Zao Zao, my name is Bai Wei. I’ve heard so much about you from your uncle!” ”

“Bai Wei had been in the nightclub for so many years, but she had never seen such a beautiful girl. ”

Beautiful.

She was really too beautiful.

“If this was in their nightclub, it would be the brightest star in the night sky, the kind that was sought after by tens of thousands of people. ”

“”Hello, Auntie Bai,”ye Zhu greeted politely. ”

Bai Wei frowned.

Ye Zhu was just a nineteen-year-old child.

But she felt an inexplicable pressure.

It was very strange.

That feeling was like seeing the supreme leader of a nightclub.

She felt a little weak.

She didn’t even dare to look up at Ye Zao.

Bai Wei lowered her head to look at herself.

“She didn’t say anything wrong, and she didn’t offend the mother and daughter. ”

She was well-dressed too...

But why did her heart feel like it was weighed down by a big stone?

“Ye Shu looked at Bai Wei and asked, “What does your family do?” ”

Ye Shu only had a rough idea of what happened yesterday.

She was afraid that she would misunderstand Bai Wei.

She couldn’t just kill her with one blow.

“Bai Wei continued, “My father is a university professor, and my mother is an archaeologist. They are currently living abroad.” ”

“In fact, Bai Wei’s parents were just a pair of very ordinary farmers. ”

Ye Shu nodded. “Then your family is a scholarly family! How many brothers and sisters do you have?”

“”I’m an only child.”Bai Wei continued, “That’s why I’m very envious of Ye Sen for having such a good sister like you!” ”

Ye Shu smiled.

“Seeing that ye Shu did not reply, Bai Wei immediately changed the topic. “Oh right, sister, I brought you a gift. It’s a small token of my appreciation. I don’t know if you like it.” ”

“As she spoke, Bai Wei took out the gift that she had prepared earlier. ”

It was a brand-name lipstick.

No woman could resist a lipstick.

“Ye Shu declined politely. “I appreciate your kindness, but I don’t know how to put on makeup very well. You can keep it for yourself.” ”

“Bai Wei placed the gift box on the table. “Sister, I’ve brought it with me. Please accept it.” ”

“Ye Sen immediately spoke up for Bai Wei. “Sister, this lipstick has been chosen by Bai Wei for a long time. Just keep it.” ”

“But I really don’t need it.”Ye Shu stood up. “You guys chat first. I’ll Go Cook.”

“”Sister, let me help you!”Bai Wei immediately stood up as well. ”

Ye Shu refused. “No need. The kitchen is too smoky. Don’t get your clothes dirty.” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“It’s okay. I often cook at home.”

“This time, Ye Shu looked at Bai Wei in surprise. ”

“Logically speaking, a girl who often cooked at home and loved life would not have a bad personality. ”

Why would Bai Wei...

Could it be that she misunderstood Bai Wei?

Ye Shu and Bai Wei went to the kitchen to work.

Only Ye Sen and ye Zhuo were left in the living room.

“Ye Sen looked at Ye Zhuo. “Eldest niece, do you not like Bai Wei very much?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

Ye Sen was stunned. He did not expect ye Zao to be so Frank.

“Why don’t you like her?”Ye Sen continued to ask.

“Ye Zao picked up an apple. As he chewed on it, he told her about what he saw in the mall yesterday. ”

“Hearing this.., ye Sen said, “Eldest niece, did you guys misunderstand Bai Wei? I have known Bai Wei for a long time. She is not the kind of person to throw a tantrum! “If that cabinet lady was in the wrong first, Bai Wei could have been forgiven for giving her a slap out of anger.” ”

“After saying that, ye sen continued, “Eldest nephew, you only saw Bai Wei beating someone up, but you didn’t see the cause of the incident. It’s not good to take things out of context, right?” ”

It was normal for people to lose their temper when they were very angry.

Beauty was in the eye of the beholder. Ye Sen believed that Bai Wei was not the kind of person who would lose her temper for no reason.

“Ye Zao took a bite of the apple, then he said, “Although we didn’t see the cause of the incident, a person’s eyes will not lie. From Bai Wei’s eyes, we can see that she is not a person who is easy to get along with. “By the way, uncle, what did you say her occupation was?” ”
