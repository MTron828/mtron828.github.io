Chapter 185: 087: so it’s Ye Zao! Old Mrs. Cen was trying to trick Cen Shaoqing! 5

Old Mrs. Cen pulled Cen Shaoqing to the door of the living room. She pointed at the big fat cat nestled in ye Zao’s arms and said, “Look, you’re not even as fat as Big Fatty!”

Cen Shaoqing:”...”

The cat was his biological son.

Ye Zao was also his biological son.

Only he was not.

Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Are you not convinced?”

“No.”

Old Mrs. Cen rolled her eyes at him, “It’s useless even if you’re unconvinced. If you were really that amazing, the one nestled in Leaf’s arms wouldn’t be fat anymore! Even a cat knows to be attentive to the person they like! I don’t even have an adjective to describe you now! You’re nothing!”

After reprimanding Cen Shaoqing, old Mrs. Cen returned to the main hall and continued chatting with Ye Zao.

Her granddaughter-in-law was still the best!

Unlike that little rascal!

Her entire body was filled with disgust.

At this moment, footsteps came from outside the door.

......

“Old Madam, Madam, Young Master Zeyan is here.”

Just as she finished speaking.

A young man wearing a gray hoodie walked in from outside.

Zhou Xiang immediately stood up. “Zeyan is here.”

It was none other than Zhou Xiang’s nephew, Zhou Ze Yan.

“Auntie.”

Then, Zhou Ze Yang greeted old Madam Cen. “Hello, Old Madam.”

“Good! All Good!”Old Madam Cen said with a smile, “Take a seat quickly.”

After saying that, old madam Cen grabbed ye Zao’s hand and introduced him to Zhou Ze Yang. “Ze Yang, this is Yezi. Even though she’s younger than you, she’s not young at all. She’s the one who cured my head disease!”

Xu Zeyan was stunned.

He did not expect the legendary godly doctor to be a little girl.

Moreover, she was so beautiful.

Zhou Zeyan had never been resistant to beautiful people. He quickly stood up and extended his hand to ye Zao. “Hello, Godly Doctor Ye. I’m Zhou Zeyan.”

Ye Zao smiled faintly and touched Zhou Zeyan’s hand with his fingertips. “Mr. Zhou, you’re too polite. You can just call me by my name.”

Zhou Zeyan smiled and said, “Then you don’t have to be polite with me. Just call me by my name.”

Ye Zao was so beautiful. It would naturally be great if he could make friends with her!

Cen Shaoqing was sitting beside him.

Looking at the two people holding hands, his brows unconsciously knitted together. He had the urge to stomp on Zhou Zeyan’s dog paw.

Men and women should not be intimate!

It was too indecent.

“Zeyan, eat an apple.”Cen Shaoqing used his hand that was holding the Buddha bead to pick up an apple and handed it to Zhou Zeyan.

Zhou Zeyan immediately let go of Ye Zao’s hand and took the apple from Cen Shaoqing, feeling flattered.

His eldest cousin was ten years older than him.

He was usually not smiling.

In addition, CEN Shaoqing was always high-profile and had such a strong aura around him, which caused Zhou Zeyan to be subconsciously afraid whenever he saw Cen Shaoqing.

He did not expect his eldest cousin to take the initiative to give him an apple today.

It was really too rare.

Zhou Zeyan lowered his head and took a bite of the apple.

Kacha!

It was so sweet!

“This apple is not bad! Yezi, do you want one too?”Zhou Zeyan picked up an apple and handed it to Ye Zhuo.

“Thank you.”Ye Zhuo reached out to take the apple.

Cen Shaoqing pursed his thin lips and the pressure around him was extremely low.

“Achoo!”Zhou Zeyan suddenly sneezed and rubbed his nose. “Who’s scolding me?”

Old Mrs. Cen’s eyes darted back and forth between the two of them, and the corners of her mouth curled up into a wicked smile.

During lunch, old Mrs. Cen called Cen Shaoqing to the side alone. “Brat, I’ll ask you again. Do you really not like Yezi?”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “Yes, no matter how many times you ask, this is my answer.”

He was an unmarried man.

He only admired ye Zhuo.

“Okay!”Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Then I won’t set you and Yezi Up! You Don’t like her anyway!” Old Mrs. Cen changed the topic. “Shaoqing, what do you think of Zeyan? Does he match Yezi quite well?”

The old lady’s eyes were full of calculation.

Isn’t Cen siu-ching stubborn?

Then she will give some crisis to CEN Shaoqing to see!

Let him worry for a while!

Experience a cold one-time cool, chasing his wife crematorium taste.

Otherwise, he’ll never see his own heart.

I have to say, Zhou Zeyan’s timing is impeccable.

Not only is she the best grandma in the universe,.

And the smartest Grandma in the universe!

Cen Shaoqing slightly frowned, fingertips around the Buddha beads, “Grandma, you are in a mess point mandarin duck spectrum!” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Who says I’m messing with the music! What if the leaf also likes Ze Yang? Zeyang is not bad! If nothing else, he is at least ten years younger than you! Unlike you, in the old words, can be the father of leaves! No wonder you can’t catch leaf!”
