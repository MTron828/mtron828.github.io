Life was a gamble.

And she was at the crucial moment of revealing the answer to the riddle.

“Doctor Liu frowned. “Miss Chen, everyone has an impulsive moment. Believe me, after this impulsive period, you won’t make the same choice.” ”

“”See the guest out,”Chen Siyao said again. ”

Little Xu had no choice but to force doctor Liu to go downstairs.

“Chen Siyao looked at Doctor Liu’s back, and hope appeared in her eyes again. ”

“Although doctor Liu denied that song Shiyu was the one who said those words, she had a special feeling that it must be song Shiyu’s intention. ”

“Otherwise, doctor Liu would never have come all the way here! ”

Just Persevere.

There was hope soon.

Yun Jing.

“Old Master Chen had gone to several places in a day, but he could not find anyone who could help the Chen family. ”

“Not only that, there was also a problem with the Chen Group’s transnational cooperation case. ”

They were currently in a state of turmoil!

“Old Master Chen’s health was not good to begin with. After experiencing these two twists and turns, his spirit was even worse. He was now bedridden. ”

“Have you managed to contact Shi Shi?”Old Master Chen looked at his assistant.

The assistant shook his head. “No.”

Old Master Chen Sighed.

“The Chen family had suffered such a great calamity. Other than song Shi Yu, no one else could pull the Chen family out of the mud. ”

“The Butler continued from the side, “Old Master, don’t be anxious. It’s just that we haven’t managed to contact third master song yet.” ”

Not Anxious?

The Chen family had become like this in just a few days.

“First, Chen You Long was locked up in the detention center and was about to face ten years in prison. Then, the Chen Corporation was about to collapse. How could old master Chen not be anxious? ”

“He only hated himself for not closing his eyes earlier. If he had closed his eyes earlier, he wouldn’t have been able to see these terrible things! ”

“Is there any news from Yaoyao?”Old Master Chen asked.

The Butler shook his head. “Not yet.”

Old Master Chen sighed again.

“The butler continued, “Old Master, don’t think too much. Sometimes, no news is good news.” ”

“At times like this, if there was news from Chen siyao, there were only two types of news. ”

The first type was that song Shiyu had compromised.

The second type was that something had happened to Chen Siyao!

“If it was the first type, it would be fine. But if it was the second type, then old master Chen really wouldn’t be able to hold on! ”

It wasn’t easy for the Chen family either!

“Chen Youlong, the pillar of support, was locked up in the detention center. Chen Siyao, the star of the future, was desperate for love. All that was left was old master Chen. ”

“The butler continued, “Old man, should we tell the eldest miss not to let her really hurt herself?” ”

“The Butler had watched Chen Siyao grow up with his own eyes, so he didn’t want Chen Siyao to be hurt. ”

“Say what? Let Her stop the plan?”Old Man Chen turned to look at the butler. “Now is really the critical moment. The rise and fall of the Chen family depends on her!”

Chen Siyao had to persevere to the end!

Only by persevering to the end could she see hope.

“The housekeeper frowned and said worriedly, “What if... What if third master turns a blind eye?” ”

“He won’t!”Old Master Chen said firmly.

“He had done song Shiyu a favor, so song Shiyu definitely couldn’t just watch Chen Siyao Die! ”

Definitely Not!

“The butler continued, “But everything is a contingency. You Can’t be so absolute.” ”

“”You don’t understand Shiyu very well.”Old Master Chen looked at the butler and said, “Shiyu will definitely appear at the critical moment!” ”

Just wait!

“As long as song Shiyu appeared, those families that had been pushed down by everyone would regret it! ”

“Thinking of this, a hopeful light appeared in Old Master Chen’s eyes. ”

“Seeing Old Master Chen like this, the Butler didn’t say anything else. ”

“Although he was different from the other servants in the Chen family, he wasn’t related to the Chen family after all. Some things were best left unsaid. Talking too much would make people dislike him. ”

Another Day passed.

“Although it was only a short day, Chen Siyao was having an extremely hard time. Almost no one could understand the feeling of hunger. ”

It was terrifying.

“Especially in the dead of the night, when she smelled the aroma of the barbecue by the beach. ”

Chen Siyao swallowed.

Hold on.

She had to hold on.

“In a trance, she seemed to see song Shiyu’s smiling face. ”

“Song Shiyu smiled and called her, “Yaoyao.” ”

“Shiyu.”

“The two of them appeared at the beach together. Song Shiyu took photos of her with his camera, hugged her, and kissed her. ”

Their laughter drowned out the sound of the waves.
