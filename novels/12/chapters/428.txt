“Chapter 429: 121: if I bump into them, they are both from Beijing University. Feng Qianhua’s fear, ye Shu found his biological daughter! 4”

Ye Shu had the same intention.

“”No, no, Lizi, Pingting, and I have an appointment to leave together. Uncle, you and my mom can go first.”An Lizi and Zhao Pingting filled in Qinghua University and Beijing Normal University respectively. ”

“Although they were not in the same school, they were not too far away. Besides Zhao Pingting, Qinghua University was next door to Beijing University. ”

“Therefore, the three of them had already made an appointment to go to Beijing together. ”

“Ye Shu asked worriedly, “Then can you stay at home alone?” ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “Are you still worried about me? Anyway, it’s only three days. I’ll go to Beijing to look for you in three days.” ”

Ye Shu nodded.

“After lunch, Ye Zhuo sent ye Shu and ye Sen to the airport. ”

It was already past two in the afternoon when they returned from the airport.

“When they reached home, Ye Zhuo began to plan for the online celebrity agency. ”

The plan was quickly customized.

They were not short of money.

All they needed now was a manager.

“Therefore, Ye Zhuo began to post the recruitment information online. ”

“After completing this series of tasks, Ye Zhuo took out the design drafts, revised them, and made a final trip to ZY technology. Ye Zhuo went straight to Zhao Yang’s office. ”

Zhao Yang personally poured a glass of water for ye Zhuo. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Ye Zhuo took out a stack of design drafts and placed them on the table. “This is the latest autumn and winter collection. The eye-catching series is a limited edition.”

“How many pieces are limited?”Zhao Yang asked.

“Ye Zhuo said, “500 pieces.” ”

Zhao Yang was stunned. “Only 500 pieces?”

“Although 500 pieces were not a small number, ZY was now a listed company, and all the new products were sold globally. ”

This was only 500 pieces.

How many seconds would it take to snatch them?

It would probably take another second!

“Ye Zhuo crossed his legs, picked up the cup, and took a sip of tea. “Isn’t there a saying that says, ‘it’s better to have a lack than to have a lack’? But in the business world, this is called hunger marketing.” ”

“Zhao Yang had learned this from the start, so he naturally understood. “Is the price the same as before?” ”

“Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “Other than this eye-catching item, the other prices are the same.” ”

“Understood.”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “By the way, Brother Zhao, I’ll be leaving Yun Jing for a period of time. I’ll only be back at the end of the year. During this period of time, I’ll leave the company to you. If you have any problems, just contact me on Wechat.” ”

“Where are you going?”Zhao Yang was a little curious.

“After all, after working with Ye Zhuo for so long, Ye Zhuo had never left Yun Jing for a long period of time. ”

“”I’m going to the capital to study,”ye Zhuo replied. ”

Zhao yang instantly understood.

Ye Zhuo was really too amazing.

“Although he was only nineteen years old, whether it was his temperament or his mannerisms, he did not seem like a nineteen-year-old child. Therefore, Zhao Yang had almost forgotten that this person was still a student. ”

“”Then I wish you a smooth journey.”Zhao yang continued, “Leave the company to me. Don’t worry.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. ”

She said a few more things to Zhao Yang before leaving.

“When they passed by the cubicle downstairs, everyone looked up at her with curiosity flashing in their eyes. ”

“It was just this little girl. In just a few minutes, she had solved a problem that more than a dozen people in the program department could not solve. ”

“Miss Ye!”

A short-haired girl mustered up her courage and called out to Ye Zhuo.

“Ye Zhuo looked back slightly, and the corners of her mouth curled up into a smile. “You’re calling for me?” ”

“Yes.”The short-haired girl nodded.

“What’s the matter?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“The short-haired girl continued, “I’ve encountered a little problem here. Can you help me take a look?”The short-haired girl had just come to ZY not long ago, and there would more or less be a phenomenon of bullying in the workplace. ”

“She had consulted many people about the problem she had encountered, but none of them had told her the actual plan. ”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly and walked over.

“In less than two minutes, ye Zhuo had solved the short-haired girl’s problem and handed her a note. “This is my wechat. You can add it. Next time you encounter any problems, you can directly send me a wechat message.” ”

“The short-haired girl had originally intended to give it a try. She did not expect ye Zhuo not only to respond to her, but also to be so amiable. ”

“After saying this, ye Zhuo continued, “Who is the team leader of Team C?” ”

“Me.”A young woman who looked very capable stood up.

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “Allowing the team members to bully the new employees. You Don’t have to come to work tomorrow.”

“Hearing this, the young woman’s face immediately turned pale. ”

She had only been in office for less than three months.

It was said that new officials were always in a hurry. She just wanted to establish some prestige so that everyone could obey her. She did not expect to cause such a big mess.
