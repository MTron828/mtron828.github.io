Translator: 549690339

“The Way Old Mrs. Cen looked at Samoyed was even more loving than looking at her own grandson, Cen Shaoqing. ”

“The kindness in her eyes was almost overflowing. One after the other, they looked like two completely different people. ”

“”Great-grandmother’s good great-grandson, quickly call her great-grandmother.”At the end, she even hugged the dog’s head and kissed it. ”

“Cen Shaoqing stood behind Old Mrs. Cen. Seeing her like this, he said somewhat speechlessly, “Grandmother, didn’t you just say that it was ugly?” ”

“”Am I talking about it? I’m obviously talking about you!”Old Lady Cen rolled her eyes at Cen Shaoqing. “I’m so annoyed when I see you! My Obedient Great-grandson is still the prettiest! Great-grandson, right?” ”

“Woof!”Samoyed seemed to understand Old Lady Cen’s compliment and immediately cried out.

“Seeing this, old lady cen said in surprise, “Oh my God! Yezi, look at how smart it is! It can even understand us! It’s not like this little rascal. Not only is it ugly, it only learned to speak when it was two years old! It’s very annoying!” ”

“As Old Madam Cen said this, she rolled her eyes at Cen Shaoqing. She looked as if she was disgusted by him. ”

“Cen Shaoqing:”...”in the past, his position in Old Madam Cen’s heart was not as high as ye Zhuo’s. ”

“But now, he could not even be compared to a dog with a straight face! ”

Ye Zhuo turned to look at Cen Shaoqing and raised his eyebrows slightly. “You only learned to speak when you were two years old?”

“Cen Shaoqing touched his nose and continued, “I could read and write when I was three years old, read historical records when I was five years old, and learned three languages when I was seven years old.” ”

There was a type of genius known as the accumulation of experience. Cen Shaoqing was one of them.

“Back then, Cen Shaoqing could not speak even when he was three years old. He was taciturn and not as lively and active as children his age. Old Madam Cen was once worried that Cen Shaoqing was a fool, she secretly took Cen Shaoqing to do three or four intelligence tests. ”

“After he was two years old, Cen Shaoqing suddenly opened his mouth to speak. The first thing he said was three hundred Tang poems. No matter how they tested him, he could answer them smoothly. ”

Only then did old Mrs. Cen Relax!

“However, after a few years of comfortable life, Old Mrs. Cen became anxious again. ”

“Because CEN Shaoqing actually saw through the secular world during his restless adolescence. He ate vegetarian and chanted Buddha all day. Other People’s children were busy dating and chasing their girlfriends. He ate vegetarian and chanted Buddha. Other People’s children were busy getting married and having children, he was still eating vegetarian food and praying to Buddha. ”

“It was fine if he ate vegetarian food and prayed to Buddha. In the end, Cen Shaoqing still ran to the temple all day long! ”

“He stayed for a few days. During those days, old Mrs. Cen was extremely anxious. In addition to the torture of her head disease, old Mrs. Cen could not sleep all day long during that period of time. ”

“Later, Old Mrs. Lin gave her an idea and asked her to force Cen Shaoqing. ”

“If it weren’t for Old Lady Cen threatening him with death, Cen Shaoqing would never have set foot in cloud capital. ”

Only when she met Ye Zhuo in cloud capital did old lady CEN relax.

Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly. “Is that true?”

“”If you don’t believe me, Ask Grandma.”Cen Shaoqing looked back. ”

Ye Zhuo looked at Old Lady Cen.

“Old Lady Cen nodded. “There is such a thing, but so what? After growing up, you still became stupid. If it weren’t for me, you wouldn’t even be able to find a wife. You’re just a sand sculpture!” ”

“Back then, she was shocked when she saw ye Zhuo. She thought that this person would definitely be her granddaughter-in-law in the future. She did not expect that her dream would come true in the end! ”

“If she had not set up Cen Shaoqing to be jealous, Cen Shaoqing would still be insisting on not getting married! ”

Old Mrs. Cen sometimes felt that she was the best grandmother in the world. There was no one like her!

“”Yezi, do you think I’m the best grandmother in the Universe?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded lightly. “Very much so. You must be.”

Old Mrs. Cen was very happy to be coaxed. “My granddaughter-in-law is still the best. Unlike that Brat who only knows how to make me angry.”

Cen Shaoqing touched his nose.

“Old Mrs. Cen pulled the dog leash with one hand and held ye Zao’s arm with the other. “Let’s go in, Zao Zao Zao! The wind is too strong outside!” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zao nodded slightly and followed Old Mrs. Cen into the house.

Cen Shaoqing followed behind the two of them.

“After entering the house, Old Mrs. Cen sat on the sofa. While stroking the dog’s head, she said, “Yezi, have you given my great-grandson a name?” ”

“The Samoyed’s fur was not only snow-white, but it was also luxuriant. Most importantly, it was very fat. It weighed a total of 70 pounds! It felt very comfortable to touch! ”

“”Not yet.”Ye Zhuo shook his head slightly. “Grandma Cen, Why don’t you give it one?” ”

“Grandma Cen looked at the plump and round samoyed. “Look at how white it is, how beautiful it is, and how bright its eyes are. Why don’t we call it...” ”Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎
