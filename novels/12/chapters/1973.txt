Chapter 1974: 414: The Conspiracy has been exposed and she is going straight to jail! 1

Translator: 549690339

Xu Yao was caught off guard and was thrown to the ground by he ziteng. Intense pain came from her knees and hands.

What was going on.

What the hell was going on?

Did He ziteng find out about her and Mi Chen?

“Otherwise, why would he ziteng say these words? ”

But how did he ziteng find out?

It was only for a moment. Xu Yao’s face turned extremely pale.

“If these things were exposed, what would she do? ”

“Not to mention Xu Yao, even the He family’s parents were stunned. Mother he immediately helped Xu Yao up. “Yaoyao, are you okay?” ”

“”I’m fine.”Xu Yao shook her head and turned to look at he ziteng. “Ziteng, what’s Wrong?” ”

“He ziteng sneered. “What’s wrong with me? Xu Yao, you and Mi Chen, don’t you know what you’ve done together? You still have the face to ask me what’s Wrong!” ”

He ziteng only wanted to kill Xu Yao now.

This woman was the greatest humiliation in his life!

“”What did I do?”Xu Yao looked at he ziteng with red eyes. “Between me and Mi Chen, we’re innocent. What’s wrong with us? You, on the other hand, just woke up and you’re accusing me and Mi Chen so indiscriminately!” ”

“Speaking up to this point, Xu Yao’s tone softened a little as she said with tears in her eyes, “Ziteng, what’s wrong with you? Are you feeling unwell somewhere? Can you tell me?” ”

“”Pretending! You’re still pretending! Xu Yao, why didn’t I realize that you were so good at acting before?”Now that he thought about it, he felt that it was ironic. ”

He ziteng used to think that Xu Yao was the best girl in the world.

“Not only was she beautiful, but she was also understanding. ”

It was his fortune to be able to find a girlfriend like Xu Yao.

He never dreamed that Xu Yao would betray him.

“Perhaps, from the moment he met Xu Yao, all of this was a trap. ”

Mi Chen narrowed her eyes and watched this scene.

He had to think of a way to resolve all of this as soon as possible.

“Otherwise, all of his previous efforts would have been in vain! ”

“Xu Yao shook her head and said very sadly, “Ziteng, I didn’t! I really didn’t. What’s wrong with you? Why are you treating me like this? Are you still the He ziteng that I know?” ”

“Hearing this, mother he frowned slightly. “Ziteng! What’s going on? What do you mean by these words? Are you talking nonsense?” ”

The He family’s parents were a little dumbfounded.

They couldn’t believe that what he ziteng said was true.

“After spending the past few days together, mother he had completely accepted Xu Yao. Xu Yao was sensible and obedient. Now that she saw Xu Yao being wronged, how could mother he accept it? ”

“Furthermore, Mi Chen was her savior. If it wasn’t for Mi Chen, she would have already died. ”

“Most importantly, Xu Yao and Mi Chen didn’t know each other at all. ”

“After all, he ziteng had just woken up, so it was normal for him to be a little confused. ”

“”Mom, Dad, we’ve been tricked! We’ve all been tricked!”He ziteng turned to look at his parents, “Mi Chen and Xu Yao have known each other for a long time. They’ve been hooking up in the dark! “The bastard in Xu Yao’s stomach isn’t mine at all! “The two of them are here for the He family’s property. “Their plan is to get rid of me first, then use the bastard in Xu Yao’s stomach to inherit the he family’s property! “After everything goes according to plan, they’ll design a plan to get rid of you and dad as well! “At that time, this adulterous couple will be able to be together legally!” ”

Mi Chen and Xu Yao had been together for a long time.

“Therefore, the bastard in Xu Yao’s stomach was definitely Mi Chen’s! ”

He ziteng controlled his desire to kill.

He had to pay with his life.

It was not worth it for such an adulterous couple.

“What are you saying?”Mother he was stunned when she heard these words.

Father he was also stunned.

The expression on Xu Yao’s face was very panicked.

What should she do?

What should she do now?

He ziteng really heard everything.

“After all, Mi Chen had indeed told her these words. ”

“Mi Chen looked in Xu Yao’s direction and gave her a look without leaving a trace, indicating that everything should be handed over to him. ”

“Whether it was creating a car accident or being with Xu Yao, he had cleaned up his tail very thoroughly. ”

Did He ziteng have evidence?

“If he didn’t have any evidence, it would be called framing! ” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Xu Yao tried her best to calm herself down after receiving mi Chen’s gaze.

“At this moment, she couldn’t panic. ”

“The next second, Mi Chen laughed out loud. ”

“Laughter suddenly appeared in the quiet space, causing everyone to shift their gazes to him. ”

“Mi Chen looked at he ziteng and said, “Ziteng, are you sure you’re not dreaming? “Even the traffic police said that you were in a traffic accident, but you said that I was the one who caused your accident. I’m just a doctor, how can I be so capable! “What I can’t understand the most is that you actually said that I want to get rid of you and then get rid of uncle and aunt. Ziteng, it’s already a society ruled by law. Do you really think that the police station is run by my family? I don’t have to go to jail for doing bad things?” ”
