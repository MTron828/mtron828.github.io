“Chapter 610: 146: a forceful slap to the face. This is my boyfriend, Cen Shaoqing. Feng Xianxian was dumbfounded! 4”

Old Lady Lin Sighed.

“Aunt Zhang said again, “No matter what, you are Qingxuan’s mother. I believe that he will definitely understand you! Between mother and son, how can there be any overnight feud?””

The next day was Monday.

“In the morning, Lin Jincheng sent ye Zhuo, Lin Ze, and Li Yueyue to school.”

“When they got off the car, Li Yueyue bowed to Lin Jincheng, “Thank you, uncle, for your hospitality on Saturday and Sunday. Our Prairie is picturesque. If you have time, you and Auntie must go to our prairie for a visit! I’ll be the host!””

“Lin Jincheng smiled and said, “Okay, I’ll definitely bring your auntie there.””

“”That’s settled then, uncle.”Li Yueyue stretched out her hand. “Let’s give each other a high five!””

Lin Jincheng stretched out his hand to give Li Yueyue a high five.

“Ye Zhuo looked at Lin Jincheng. “Dad, we’ll go in first.””

“Okay.”Lin Jincheng nodded and watched the three of them leave.

Lin Ze wore a black hoodie and a black mask on his face. He followed behind the two of them like a guardian God.

The passing students looked at him sideways.

Li Yueyue had never felt so many people staring at her. She felt quite embarrassed for a moment.

“At the next intersection, Lin Ze was going to separate from them to go to the boys’dormitory.”

“Li Yueyue was conflicted, but she still said, “Brother Ze, wait a moment.”” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“What’s Wrong?”Lin Ze stopped in his tracks.

Li Yueyue waved her phone. “Let’s add each other on wechat?”

Lin Ze hesitated for a moment. “Okay.”

“Hearing Lin Ze’s reply, Li Yueyue was so excited that she wanted to jump up, but she still held it in. She immediately opened wechat and added Lin Ze as a friend.”

Lin Ze’s wechat name was very simple.

It was just the initial letter of his name.

LZ.

“After adding wechat, Li Yueyue continued, “Brother ZE, is it convenient for you to tell me what kind of girl you like?””

Lin Ze was stunned.

“After a while, he replied, “I don’t know either.””

“”Ah?”Li Yueyue said incredulously, “Don’t you have any standards for choosing a partner?””

Lin Ze shook his head.

“Li Yueyue continued, “Do you like girls who have a big sister Type?””

“I don’t know.”

“Lin Ze had never met a girl that he liked, so he did not know what kind of girl he liked.”

In fact.

“Before finding ye Shu and Ye Zhuo, Lin Ze was even resistant to the opposite sex.”

“After spending time with his mother and sister, this psychological resistance to the opposite sex disappeared a lot.”

Li Yueyue originally thought that a handsome boy like Lin Ze must have had a lot of romantic experiences. She didn’t expect that Lin Ze was as pure as the little dragon girl who had just come out of the ancient tomb.

“For a moment, Li Yueyue could not bear to let her classmate, a veteran in love, Harm Lin Ze.”

“After Lin Ze left, Li Yueyue asked ye zao curiously, “Da Zao Zao, has your brother really never been in a relationship?””

“Yes.”

“Li Yueyue said, “Your brother is so handsome. There are so many girls who send him love letters every day. How could he have the heart to refuse? If it were me, I definitely wouldn’t have the heart to refuse!””

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Don’t tell me you want to have three wives and three thousand concubines?””

“Li Yueyue first nodded, then shook her head and said with a false heart, “I’m not that kind of person!””

The two of them chatted and laughed as they walked into the dormitory. Only then did they realize that Feng Xianxian and Bai Xiaoman’s beds were empty and their belongings had been moved away.

“Li Yueyue said in surprise, “I’m Giao! Did the two of them move away?””

“”From the looks of it, they should.””

“Li Yueyue smiled and said, “Then we should really celebrate! I hope that the new roommate isn’t so weird!””

“I hope so too!”

Feng Xianxian and Bai Xiaoman had indeed moved away.

“In the past, Feng Xianxian always felt superior in front of ye Zao. Now that such a thing had happened, how could Feng Xianxian still have the face to stay in the same dormitory as ye Zao?”

“In the blink of an eye, it was Friday.”

There were no classes in the morning.

Cen Shaoqing had made an appointment with ye Zao to bring her around the CEN group’s laboratory.

Ye Zao had just walked out of the school gate when he saw the familiar Maserati parked at the school gate.

“At this moment, the car door was pulled open from the inside.”

“However, it was not Cen Shaoqing who came, but his chauffeur.”

“”Miss Ye, master five has a small matter to take care of at the last minute. He asked me to pick you up.””

Ye Zao nodded. “Alright.”

This scene was coincidentally seen by Bai Xiaoman who was passing by.

She could not hear their conversation from afar. She only saw the driver opening the door for ye Zao.

But she knew this man.

Wasn’t this ye Zao’s mysterious boyfriend?
