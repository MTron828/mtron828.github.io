Translator: 549690339

Zhou Ziyue didn’t say anything.

It would be a lie to say that she didn’t feel uncomfortable.

“If this Ma Lu was like Zheng Ke, it would be fine if she was a sunny and handsome guy, but Ma Lu’s appearance made Zhou Ziyue somewhat unable to accept it. ”

“I’m talking to you! Do You Hear Me!”Ye Sui saw that Zhou Ziyue didn’t respond and reached out to Pat Zhou Ziyue.

“Zhou Ziyue handed the phone to ye Sui. “Look, this is Ma Lu.” ”

“In the photo, Ma Lu was with a beautiful woman with a good figure. The beautiful woman had a hot figure, and Ma Lu was dark and fat. She couldn’t even reach the shoulders of a beautiful woman. She was like a little dwarf! ”

Zhou Ziyue felt disgusted at the sight of such a person. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Ye Sui picked up the phone, and his eyes immediately lit up. “Look, look how well-shaped this child is! Not Bad, not bad!” ”

“”Mom, what are you talking about!”Zhou Ziyue looked at ye Sui, her eyes full of speechlessness. ”

“Ye Sui continued, “A child is not bad-looking to begin with. He has a nose and eyes. Ziyue, let me tell you, don’t look at people with your nose! “Besides, can good-looking be used as food? “Feng Yang is not bad-looking. Ask him if this beautiful woman in the photo would like Feng Yang.” ”

Zhou Ziyue was silent for a moment.

“”Besides, you don’t look that good yourself. Don’t think that you’re some kind of celestial being!”Ye Sui continued, “I’m warning you, there aren’t many chances for a woman to change her fate. Take advantage of it. If you miss this opportunity, you can’t start all over again!” ”

“After saying that, ye Sui ignored Zhou Ziyue’s reaction and immediately took out his phone to call Bai Jingshu. ”

“”Hello, is that Jingshu?” ”

“It’s me.”Bai Jingshu’s voice came from the other end of the phone.

“Ye Sui smiled and said, “Jingshu, Ziyue and I have already made an agreement. When do you think you can invite the man over and let the two of them meet?” ”

“Bai Jingshu said, “Is tomorrow morning okay? If It’s okay, I’ll go and contact Maru right now.” ”

“”Yes, yes, Absolutely.”Ye Sui smiled and said, “Anyway, Ziyue has nothing to do here.” ”

“After hanging up the phone, ye Sui looked at Zhou Ziyue. “I’ve made an appointment for you. Tomorrow morning, 9:30 am, at the Dunhuang Road Cafe.” ”

“Okay.”Zhou Ziyue nodded.

“What did you say to Feng Yang?”Ye Sui continued to ask.

“Zhou ziyue said impatiently, “We’ll talk about it tomorrow.” ”

“Ye Sui said with disappointment, “Just do it!” ”

Zhou Ziyue didn’t say anything.

“On the other side, Bai Jingshu turned to look at Lin Ze, who was lying on the bed. “Do you know who called you just now?” ”

“”Ye Sui,”Lin ze said. ”

“Bai Jingshu said in surprise, “How do you know?” ”

“Lin Ze smiled. “Not only did I know that ye Sui called, but I also know that Zhou Ziyue has agreed to meet tomorrow.” ”

Bai Jingshu gave Lin ze a thumbs up. “Smart!”

“Lin Ze continued, “Tomorrow, Zhou Ziyue will definitely tell you that she’s not some appearance association. She’s willing to try it out with Ma Lu.” ”

Bai Jingshu frowned slightly and opened the lid of the skin cream. “That’s not necessarily true.”

“”Then just you wait,”Lin ze said. ”

Bai Jingshu trusted Zhou Ziyue very much. She believed that Zhou Ziyue was a very innocent and loving person. Zhou Ziyue was definitely not like what Lin Ze had said.

“What If you lose?”Bai Jingshu asked.

“Lin Ze said, “If I lose, I’ll wash iron pillar’s diapers for a month.” ”

“Okay.”Bai Jingshu nodded. “You’ll definitely wash this diaper.”

“Lin Ze smiled and said, “What If you lose?” ”

“”I won’t lose,”Bai Jingshu said. ”

“You’re that confident?”Lin Ze asked.

Bai Jingshu raised her chin. “Of course.”

“Lin Ze continued, “If you lose, you have to promise me something.” ”

“Sure.”Bai Jingshu nodded.

On the other side.

Zhou Ziyue looked at ye Sui. “Didn’t you just say that you were going to call my dad? Tell him to bring libang over.”

“Ye Sui had just said that he was going to call back, but this time, ye Sui was already sitting in front of the dressing mirror and applying skincare products. He seemed to have forgotten what he had just said. ”

“”Didn’t Bai Jingshu say that she was going to introduce you to someone? If I call back to my hometown now, what if Bai Jingshu goes back on her word?”Ye Sui applied the expensive skincare products on his face, then he said, “So, let’s wait for your matter to be settled first!” ”

“For the time being, he still couldn’t call back. ”

Zhou Ziyue didn’t say anything.

It was already the next day.

“In the morning, ye Sui personally sent Zhou Ziyue out of the door. ”

“”Jingshu, I’ll leave Ziyue in your hands. I hope she can find a good person this time.”Ye Sui held Bai Jingshu’s hand earnestly. ”

“Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “Don’t worry.” ”

“”Okay, Jingshu. I’ll be at ease with your work.”Ye Sui nodded. ”

Dunhuang Road was not far from the Lin family manor. They would arrive in about ten minutes.

“When the two of them entered, Ma Lu had not arrived yet. ”

“Bai Jingshu smiled and looked at Zhou Ziyue. “Ziyue, Ma Lu is usually quite busy. Do you mind if we wait for a while?” ”

“I don’t mind.”Zhou Ziyue smiled and shook her head.

Bai Jingshu nodded. “Then let’s order something to drink first.”

“Okay.”

“They had agreed to meet at 9:30, but Ma Lu didn’t arrive until after 10:00. ”

“The first time Zhou Ziyue saw Ma Lu, she wished she could die on the spot. ”

Ugly.

She was really too ugly!

She had never known that there was someone in this world who could be so ugly!

“She had thought that the Ma Lu in the photo was ugly enough, but who knew that the Ma Lu in real life was even uglier! ”

“Ma Lu was holding a briefcase in her hand. “Sister-in-law, I’m sorry I’m late.” ”

“Bai Jingshu stood up with a smile. “It’s fine, it’s fine. Come, let me introduce you. This is Zhou Ziyue. Ziyue, this is Ma Lu.” ”

“Ma Lu turned to look at Zhou Ziyue, and her expression instantly changed. She looked like an emperor choosing his concubine and continued, “Ma Lu.” ”

Zhou Ziyue took the initiative to extend her hand to Ma Lu. “I’m Zhou Ziyue.”

“Ma Lu Looked Zhou Ziyue up and down before continuing, “Not bad. What University did you graduate from?” ”

“Jianglu University.”

“Ma Lu nodded and continued, “It’s barely considered a key university.” ”

Barely?

Zhou ziyue frowned slightly. She had entered a university!

What did she mean by barely?

“After saying that, Ma Lu continued, “Do you know how to do housework?” ”

“”A little,”Zhou Zi Yue said. ”

“Ma Lu sat down, then, she said, “Let me explain my requirements. I don’t like outsiders at home. So, after you marry me, you don’t need to go out to work. You can just focus on taking care of the children and doing housework at home. In addition, I will give you six figures of pocket money every month.” ”

“Zhou Ziyue felt very uncomfortable when she heard this, but she still had to force a smile. ”

Why would there be such a strange person in the world?

Zhou Ziyue wanted to slap the table and leave immediately.

But...

She couldn’t.

Because the temptation of six figures of pocket money a month was too great.

She couldn’t refuse.

“After saying this, Ma Lu looked at Zhou Ziyue and asked, “What do you think?” ”

“Zhou Zi Yue smiled and looked at Ma Lu, “Mr. Ma, we just met for the first time today. Isn’t it a little too early to talk about this?” ”

“Ma Lu said, “Not too early, not too early. After all, I’m already at the age to get married! The earlier we settle this matter, the less those two old fogeys will be at home urging me.” ”

Two Old Fogeys?

Ma Lu was referring to her parents?

Zhou Ziyue was a little speechless.

“Although she couldn’t say that she was very filial to her parents, she definitely wouldn’t say such things about her parents in public. ”

“However, she also understood from these words that what Ma Lu lacked was a marriage partner. ”

“Oh right. I still have a question to ask you.”

Zhou Ziyue took a sip of coffee. “You ask.”

“Ma Lu continued, “Are you still a virgin?” ”

Zhou Ziyue almost spat out the coffee that she had just drunk.

“Ma Lu looked at Zhou Ziyue and continued, “Our family’s views are very traditional and we care more about this. The girlfriends we found before all broke up because of this.” ”

“Zhou Ziyue and Feng Yang had been together for so many years, how could they still be virgins! ”

“But at this moment, she still nodded. ”

“Ma Lu continued, “Alright then.” ”

“At this moment, Ma Lu seemed to have thought of something and continued, “Oh right, I have another request.” ”

“Speak.”Zhou Zi Yue put down her coffee cup.

“Ma Lu continued, “My woman must be obedient. After marriage, she has to be filial to her parents-in-law. I can treat my parents badly, but you can’t!” ”

Zhou Ziyue did not say anything.

“Ma Lu continued, “Also, you can’t interfere in my personal life. It’s normal for a man to have three wives and four concubines, but you can’t! A woman has to follow the rooster, marry the dog, and follow the dog!” ”

What era was this! Why Could Ma Lu still say such words!

Zhou Ziyue was truly speechless.

“After saying this, Ma Lu continued, “Jingshu, I’ve said my conditions.” ”

“Bai Jingshu smiled at Zhou Ziyue. “Ziyue, what about you?” ”

“Zhou ziyue said, “It’s nothing for now. If Mr. Ma has a good impression of me, I think we can give it a try.” ”

She was now in a passive state. What could she say? What would she dare to say?

Ma Lu lowered her head and sent a message to Bai Jingshu. [ your cousin is really patient! ]
