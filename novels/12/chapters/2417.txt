“Therefore, CEN Shaoqing stood out. ”

“Ye Zhuo looked at Cen Shaoqing, her eyes slightly red. “Fool!” ”

“Then are you a Fool?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“”I’m not.”Ye Zhuo continued, “You are, you are the biggest fool in the world.” ”

Little by little.

“Whenever there was a little problem with C 1, CEN Shaoqing did not have the opportunity to stand here and talk to her. ”

“Cen Shaoqing smiled and said, “Oh, so Miss Ye’s boyfriend is a fool. That Miss ye is definitely not smart. Who would find a fool to be a friend of a normal person?” ”

“Ye Zhuo chuckled and continued, “You’re not allowed to do this in the future.” ”

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “Just this once.”

“How do you feel now?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“CEN Shaoqing said, “I don’t feel anything special.” ”

Ye Zhuo grabbed Cen Shaoqing’s wrist. “Let’s go. I’ll bring you to have a check-up.”

“”I’m really fine.”Seeing how serious she was, the corners of Cen Shaoqing’s mouth were filled with a helpless smile. ”

This feeling of being cared for by others was very good.

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Just because you don’t feel anything now doesn’t mean that you’re fine. Follow me to have a check-up!”Otherwise, ye Zhuo wouldn’t be at ease. ”

“Helpless, Cen Shaoqing could only follow ye Zao’s footsteps. ”

“The two of them came to the examination room. After checking that there was nothing wrong with Cen Shaoqing, ye Zao heaved a sigh of relief. ”

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “See, I already said that I’m fine.” ”

“”This time, you’re just lucky.”Ye Zao continued, “You’re not allowed to do this next time!” ”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing nodded.

Ye Zhuo was a little angry. “Lower your head and hit it for me.”

“Although the height difference between them was only about 20 centimeters, Cen Shaoqing did not lower his head. She really was not enough for Cen Shaoqing’s head. ”

“Hearing this, Cen Shaoqing immediately lowered his head. ”

Ye Zhuo patted his head.

“At this moment, a person suddenly walked out from the intersection. ”

It was worker Li.

“Cen Shaoqing immediately stood up straight and pretended as if nothing had happened, hiding his achievements and fame. ”

Worker Li looked at Cen Shaoqing and really wanted to say that he had seen master five! Stop pretending!

But he did not have the guts.

“He just greeted respectfully, “Miss Ye, master five.” ”

Ye Zhuo nodded.

Cen Shaoqing also nodded.

The two of them walked all the way to the laboratory.

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “Aren’t you going back?” ”

“Isn’t it good to advance and retreat together with you?”Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows and asked. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“”Alright,”cen Shaoqing continued, “But rest is also very important. You haven’t rested for a long time.” ”

“”Once we settle this matter, we can rest,”ye Zhuo said. ”

“Having been together with Ye Zhuo for so long, Cen Shaoqing knew ye Zhuo’s character. He also knew that no matter what he said at this moment, ye Zhuo would not listen. ”

“After a moment, Cen Shaoqing held ye Zao’s hand. “Okay, let’s advance and retreat together.” ”

“Okay.”

The two of them held hands and walked inside. The lights in the laboratory made their figures elongate.

This experiment had been going on for a day and a night.

“When ye Zao walked out of the laboratory again, he looked a little tired. ”

“Cen Shaoqing followed behind her and said, “I’ll send you back to rest first.” ”

“Just go to the lounge and rest for a while. I’ll wait for news from worker Xu and the others.”

“At present, the virus to conquer the exotic beasts had already been researched. ”

But whether it would have any effect was still unknown.

They had to wait for worker Xu’s notice.

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “I’ll go with you.”

The two of them went to the lounge together.

Cen Shaoqing poured a glass of milk for ye Zhuo.

“After drinking a glass of milk, ye Zao felt a little better. ”

There was only one bed in the lounge.

“Cen Shaoqing lay on his side on the sofa. “I’ll sleep on the sofa, you sleep on the bed.” ”

“”Then I won’t stand on ceremony,”ye Zao said. ”

“Cen Shaoqing smiled and said, “You speak as if you’ve never been polite to me.” ”

“”There’s no need to stand on ceremony with your own son,”ye Zao said. ”

“Cen Shaoqing looked at ye Zhuo and said somewhat helplessly, “Why do you always want to be my father?” ”

“Don’t meddle in my father’s matters.”Ye Zhuo raised his brows slightly.

Cen Shaoqing:”...”he had to admit that he had such an ancestor.

On the other side.

L continent.

“A Day had passed, and the population of L continent had shrunk by more than half. ”

“At this moment, the communicator suddenly rang. ”

“Mario, who was originally dejected, suddenly lit up and looked at William. “Miss Ye has sent a message!” ”

William also perked up at this moment and immediately clicked on the communicator.

Worker Xu’s face immediately appeared on the screen.
