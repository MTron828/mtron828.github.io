Bai Wei was still a little nervous. She tidied her collar and tidied her hair. “Do you think I can do this?”

“This time, she wasn’t pretending to be nervous. ”

She was really a little nervous.

What if ye Shu was a difficult person to get along with?

“Ye Sen nodded. “Yes, she’s very beautiful!” ”

Bai Wei took ye Sen’s arm. “Then let’s go in quickly.”

“Okay.”Ye Sen reached out and knocked on the door.

“Bai Wei was a little nervous outside, but ye Shu was also very nervous inside. ”

“After all, this was the first time ye Sen brought a girl back. ”

Ye Shu put the cut fruit platter on the table.

“At this moment, there was a knock on the door. ”

Little White walked over to open the door.

“Ye Shu quickly said, “I’ll do it! I’ll do it! Little White, Go Get Burning!” ”

“Okay.”Little White slid into the room.

Ye Shu jogged over to open the door.

“”Sis,”Ye Sen said with a smile. ”

“Bai Wei also called out, “Sis.” ”

Ye Shu responded and looked up at Bai Wei. The smile on her face was a little stiff.

“She was indeed very beautiful and had a gentle temperament, but why did Bai Wei look familiar. ”

As If... she had seen her somewhere before.

“At this moment, ye Shu suddenly remembered. Wasn’t this the woman who slapped the shopkeeper in the mall yesterday? ”

Was it her?

Or was she mistaken?

Ye Shu frowned slightly.

“Although her first impression of Bai Wei wasn’t very good, Ye Shu didn’t embarrass Bai Wei. After all, everyone who came was a guest. She smiled and said, “Come in quickly.” ”

What if she was mistaken?

She could not wrongly accuse the girl.

“Although ye Shu already had some doubts about Bai Wei, Bai Wei did not recognize ye Shu. ”

She also did not know that ye Shu had seen her yesterday.

“Bai Wei held ye Shu’s arm very intimately. “Sister, you really take good care of yourself! If you walk out with Ye Sen and say that you are his sister, no one will doubt you.” ”

Bai Wei’s greatest advantage was that she could talk.

“She could talk to people, but she could talk to ghosts. ”

“Ye Shu smiled and looked at Bai Wei. “You take good care of yourself too. You usually use perfect skincare products, right?” ”

Perfect was the shop that ye Shu went to yesterday.

“Bai Wei nodded and said in surprise, “Yes! SIS, don’t tell me you use the same brand as me?” ”

Ye Shu was stunned.

So she didn’t recognize her wrongly.

Bai Wei was the Miss Bai who slapped the shopkeeper sister yesterday.

“The Bai Wei today and the overbearing Miss Bai yesterday were completely different. If they hadn’t seen it with their own eyes, no one would believe that they were the same person. ”

“Perhaps, there was some misunderstanding about this matter? ”

“Ye Shu frowned without leaving a trace and continued, “Come in and sit.” ”

“Perfect skincare products are not bad! The moisturizing and anti-wrinkle effects are very good. No wonder you take such good care of yourself! I can’t tell your real age at all!”Perfect skincare products were not cheap.

Ye Shu naturally could not afford to use such skincare products with a burden on her.

“Without even thinking, she must have used ye Sen’s money. ”

“The mother and daughter Ate Ye Sen’s and used ye Sen’s, but now she, the future mistress, was actually trying to please her! ”

How infuriating!

A sullen look flashed across Bai Wei’s lowered eyes. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“But now, she had not registered with Ye Sen, so she could only endure these grievances. ”

“Coming to the living room, Ye Shu said to Ye Sen, “Quickly bring some fruit for Miss Bai to eat.” ”

Ye Sen nodded and handed a watermelon to Bai Wei. “Just treat this place as your home. Take whatever you want to eat. Don’t stand on ceremony.”

“Bai Wei took the watermelon and said with a smile, “Sister, you can just call me Bai Wei or Xiao Wei.” ”

“Ye Sen smiled and said, “Yes, yes, yes. We’re all family. It’s too strange to call Miss Bai.”Ye Sen was going to marry Bai Wei. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have brought Bai Wei home so quickly. ”

Family?

“Perhaps because of yesterday’s incident, Ye Shu couldn’t like Bai Wei at all. She always felt that Bai Wei wasn’t a good girl. ”

Ye Shu picked up the cup and took a sip of tea. “You’ve only known each other for three months. It’s a little early to say this.”

An awkward look flashed across Bai Wei’s face.

She was very angry in her heart!

Ye Shu was just a pitiful wretch who lived under someone else’s roof. What right did she have to give her a look?

It was really disgusting!

Ye Sen was also a little puzzled.

Ye Shu was usually a person who was easy to talk to. Why was she acting a little strange today?

Could it be that she didn’t like Bai Wei?

Or was there a hidden reason?

“Ye Shu and he were siblings for many years, and he knew that Ye Shu wasn’t the kind of person who would change her face just like that. ”
