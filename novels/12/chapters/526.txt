“Chapter 527: 134: continue to slap the face, the large-scale and fragrant scene! 4”

“At that moment, Old Lady Lin could only bring Feng Xianxian to the banquet. As they walked, she comforted Feng Xianxian in a low voice, “Xianxian, don’t be afraid! Grandma will definitely help you vent your anger in the future! Teach this wild girl a good lesson!” ”

“Feng Xianxian said kindly, “Grandma, I Don’t blame her. I know she didn’t mean it, so please don’t blame her.” ”

“Hearing this, Old Mrs. Lin’s heart ached even more. “Good girl, you’re as kind as your mother! If that wild girl was half as sensible as you, I’d be satisfied!” ”

Old Mrs. Cen looked at Old Mrs. Lin who was walking over and was so angry that she blew her beard and glared at her.

Was this Zhao fangyue really senile?

She didn’t want her outstanding biological granddaughter.

Going to get close to an outsider who is nothing!

Isn’t she afraid of Hurting Ye Zao’s Heart?

What an old fool!

“Seeing Old Mrs. Cen looking in her direction, Feng Xianxian’s eyes reddened even more. ”

“Needless to say, old Mrs. Cen must be trying to redress her grievances. ”

“After all, she was the granddaughter-in-law that old Mrs. Cen had taken a fancy to in the first place. ”

What’s with Ye Zao’s meddling now?

Feng Qianhua was sitting next to Feng Xianxian.

“When ye Zao started playing the piano, she had sensed a strong sense of crisis. ”

“She was originally the same as everyone else, thinking that ye Zao was just an idiot who knew nothing. ”

“But if ye Zao was really an idiot, how could he play such a difficult piano piece? ”

How could an idiot be so sharp-tongued?

“Although the amount of medicine used back then was not much, it was enough to damage one’s intelligence. After all, Ye Zao was just a little baby at that time. ”

“If ye Zao’s intelligence was not damaged, why would there be rumors in the cloud capital that Ye Zao was an idiot? ”

What exactly happened in between?

“Feng Qianhua pinched her fingers. There was still a smile on her face, but she was a little flustered in her heart. ”

She hoped that everything would go smoothly from now on.

Feng Qianhua looked down at her watch.

It was already 10:30 am.

It was almost time.

Lin Jincheng brought ye Shu and ye Zhuo to the banquet to recognize them.

“”Ah Shu, this is second sister-in-law and third sister-in-law.” ”

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “Second sister-in-law and third sister-in-law, I’m Ye Shu. You can just call me by my name.” ”

“Ye Zhuo followed behind them and greeted them politely, “Hello, second aunt and third aunt.” ”

“Zhang Zhenzhen and Yang Wenyin had thought that ye Shu and ye Zhuo were just like the rumors. They thought that they were just two people who couldn’t stand up to the public. They didn’t expect that not only were the mother and daughter good-looking, but ye Zhuo also knew how to play the piano. ”

“Not only did they not embarrass the Lin family at all, they even gave them face. ”

Who Didn’t like an outstanding and smart niece?

It was ye Zhuo who used his strength to conquer them.

“Zhang Zhenzhen held ye Shu’s hand affectionately, “Fifth sister-in-law, you’re really lucky to have a good daughter, unlike the two of us who didn’t even have a daughter’s life! This is a small gift that I prepared for you and the child to meet. Don’t be polite with me.”As she said this, zhang Zhenzhen stuffed a red packet into ye Shu’s hand. ”

“Yang Wenyin also stuffed a generous red packet into ye Shu’s hand. “Fifth sister-in-law, you’ve accepted second sister-in-law’s, you can’t not accept mine!” ”

“These two sisters-in-law were not fools. From ye Zao playing the piano just now, it could be seen that ye Zao was not some idiot. ”

“To be able to teach such an outstanding daughter like Ye Zao, Ye Shu was even more not a simple person! ”

No wonder Lin Jincheng insisted on bringing them back.

Ye Shu did not refuse and accepted it with a smile.

Lin Jincheng brought ye Shu and ye Zao to get to know the Lin family’s second brother and third brother. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Ye Shu held up her wine glass. “Second brother and third brother, let me propose a toast to the both of you.” ”

“The Lin family’s second brother and third brother stood up and downed the wine in their glasses in one gulp. “Sister-in-law, eldest niece, from now on, we will be a family. Everything is said without saying. Everything is in this glass of wine.” ”

“Then, they went to the side of old Mrs. Cen and Cen Shaoqing. ”

“Lin Jincheng continued to introduce, “Ah Shu, this is old Mrs. Cen.” ”

“Hearing this, Feng Qianhua looked over. ”

A sarcastic light flashed in her eyes.

Old Mrs. Cen was not some kind old lady. It would be strange if she would bother with Ye Shu.

“Ye Shu held up the wine cup and said, “Old Mrs. Cen, let me toast to you.” ”

“Old Lady Cen stood up with her wine cup in her hand. “Ah Shu, this old lady feels close to you the moment she sees you!” ”

“At this point, Old Lady Cen placed her wine cup on the table, took off the bracelet on her hand, and put it on Ye Shu’s wrist. “I don’t have anything to give you on our first meeting. This bracelet can be considered a gift from me.” ”

“When she said this, everyone was stunned. ”

“After all, this was the old Mrs. Cen! ”
