“No.”Li Yueyue sniffed. “I just miss you and mom too much.”

“Hearing that, father Li heaved a sigh of relief, but he was still a little worried. “Yuebao, are you really okay?” ”

“”I’m really okay,”Li Yueyue said. ”

“”If someone bullies you, you must tell Dad!”Father Li continued. ”

“”Yes, I know.” ”

“After saying that, father li continued, “Yuebao, I heard that you found a boyfriend, right?” ”

“”We broke up,”Li Yueyue said. ”

Broke up?

“Father Li immediately sensed that something was wrong from these words, then he said, “Yuebao, did that Stinky Man Bully You? Tell Daddy, What’s His name! Although Daddy doesn’t know many people in the capital, there are still people who help you vent your anger!” ”

“”No, he didn’t bully me. We broke up because I saw his character clearly.”Li Yueyue tried hard to calm herself down, he continued, “Daddy, I’m really fine. You Don’t have to worry about me. By the way, are you and mom okay at home? Where’s My Brother? Is He back yet?” ”

“”He’s not back yet.”Father Li continued, “Yuebao, I heard that you’re coming back by train during winter vacation, right?” ”

“Yes.”Li Yueyue nodded.

“”It’s too slow to come back by train! Dad will fly over to pick you up! By the way, is there a place to park your plane in your school?” ”

“”No, no, no!”Li Yueyue immediately stopped him, “Dad, please don’t do this. I haven’t taken a train at my age! Please let me take a train!” ”

“It was said that the route from the capital to the prairie was very beautiful, especially in winter. One could sit in the train and enjoy the scenery along the way. ”

“Because the journey was far away, one could even enjoy the spring, summer, autumn, and winter. ”

“Li Yueyue had wanted to experience it for a long time, but unfortunately, she never had the chance. ”

“Because father Li felt that the old-fashioned train was slow, the seats were hard, and it was uncomfortable to sit on, so every time school started, father Li would charter a plane to come over. ”

“As a result, father Li had recently obtained a flight permit and went to buy a plane. He wanted to fly the plane over to pick up Li Yueyue. ”

“Father Li continued, “Yuebao, listen to your father. Will Father Hurt You? I promise you, as long as you board the train, you will definitely regret it!” ”

“”Father, I just want to board the train, please...” ”

“Father Li’s heart ached for his daughter. He did not want Li Yueyue to board the train, but he could not persuade Li Yueyue, so he could only let Li Yueyue experience the feeling of flying. ”

“”Alright, Alright. Since you want to take the train so much, let’s take it once.”After saying that, father li continued, “If you regret it halfway, get off the train quickly. Daddy will fly a plane to pick you up.” ”

“”Okay, thank you, Daddy.”Seeing that Father Li finally agreed, Li Yueyue was especially excited. ”

“”Oh right, Yuebao, I just asked your mother to transfer some money to you. Don’t treat yourself unfairly in life. Buy More delicious food. If you don’t have enough money, call your mother and tell her not to save money for me and your mother, okay? “Isn’t that what your parents earn money for? “Otherwise, what’s the point of US earning money?” ”

“Li Yueyue said, “Dad, you just transferred money to me last month. I have enough money to spend. You Don’t have to transfer money to me anymore!”Ever since she came to Beijing to study, father Li was always worried that she wouldn’t be able to eat well and sleep well outside, he would transfer money to her every once in a while. ”

“And every time, it wasn’t a small amount that Li Yueyue wouldn’t be able to spend in a year. ”

“At this time, when she heard that her father was going to transfer money to her again, Li Yueyue couldn’t help but hold her forehead. ”

“Li Yueyue continued, “Dad, my money is really enough to spend. I don’t have any expenses at school, so I really don’t need that much money.” ”

“”This child, is there anyone who dislikes having too much money?”Father Li continued, “Yuebao, girls must not mistreat themselves. Besides, you are already so old. You should learn to teach yourself a lesson! “You see, other little girls like to buy some bags and skin care products, but you don’t buy anything! “This year, when you go home for the New Year, you must buy five bags! “And buy a watch. That Dan something is not bad! “If you don’t buy it, I will ask your mother to mail it to you after she buys it!” ”

“The Li family was a nouveau riche. That year, father Li accidentally bought a lottery ticket, but he did not expect to win five million! ”

“In that era, five million was not a small amount. After obtaining this fortune, father Li did not lose his sense of direction, but did a good accounting. ”

How long could the family spend this five million?

“In the end, the husband and wife made a major decision, using the five million to invest in the breeding industry. ”

“Just like that, the final five million became ten million, ten million became fifty million, sixty million... ... this cycle continued for more than ten years. At the moment, even father Li did not know how much money he actually had. ”

“Hearing her father say this, Li Yueyue hurriedly said, “Okay Dad, I got it. Don’t worry, I will definitely bring five bags home this year. Please don’t let my mother buy them!” ”

Mother Li was born in her 60s and had a unique vision. She especially liked the bright red and green colors.

“”Yuebao, girls must learn to take good care of themselves. How many times have I told you this? Why Can’t You Learn?” ”

“”I understand, dad,”Li Yueyue said. ”

Father Li hung up after giving some instructions.

On the other side.

He ziteng had officially embarked on the path of pursuing Xu Xiao.

“When she received he ziteng’s confession, Xu Xiao was stunned. Her heart was racing and her face was red. ”

“Never in her wildest dreams did she expect that one day, he ziteng would really confess to her. ”

This was he ziteng!

It was very unreal.

“Xu Xiao suppressed the excitement in her heart and continued, “Mr. HE, the time we have spent together is too short. If we were to say love now, it would be too fake. How about this, can you let me go back and think about it?” ”

“If she were to directly agree, then she would be no different from an ordinary girl. ”

“Therefore, he had to fish he ziteng for a while. ”

He ziteng did not expect Xu Xiao to reject him.

It seemed that Xu Xiao was indeed not quite what he had imagined.

“He ziteng looked at Xu Xiao and continued, “Sure. Then let’s meet here at this time tomorrow. What do you think?” ”

“Okay.”Xu Xiao nodded.

“”Then it’s settled.”He ziteng continued, “Xu Xiao, I’m not a good talker. I hope you can seriously consider it.” ” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Xu Xiao nodded.

He ziteng looked at his watch. “Then that’s all for now. I have a meeting in the afternoon.”

“Xu Xiao smiled and said, “Mr. He, you can go back to your work first.” ”

“He ziteng said, “I hope that after we meet tomorrow, you can address me differently.” ”

Xu Xiao smiled and did not say anything.

“After he ziteng left, Xu Xiao also returned to the Xu family. ”

The first thing she did when she returned to the Xu family was to tell her parents about this matter.

“When she found out that Xu Xiao had actually rejected he ziteng, mother Xu immediately stood up from her chair and said, “Xiaoxiao! Are you crazy! That’s the He family! If you reject he ziteng, where are you going to find such a rich husband!” ”

“”Long hair, short knowledge!”Father Xu looked at mother Xu, then he said, “This is called wanting to get an old friend! For a person like he ziteng, what kind of girlfriend do you have to find first? If our Xiao Xiao doesn’t act special, do you think you can capture he ziteng’s heart?” ”
