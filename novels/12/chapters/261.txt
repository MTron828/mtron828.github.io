Translator: 549690339

“This time, he sent another ten peerless beauties in a row. ”

The bullet screen was filled with the words ‘Big Boss 666’and ‘request for a mistress’.

He sent two batches of gifts.

Cen Shaoqing suddenly heard ye Zhuo say that he would not play chess tonight and would continue playing games.

Continue playing games?

“Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly and sent another ten or so gifts. Then, he closed his computer and walked downstairs. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen and Zhou Xiang were sitting on the sofa in the living room, applying facial masks. ”

“Seeing Cen Shaoqing come down, Zhou Xiang asked curiously, “Shaoqing, where are you going?” ”

“”I’m going to Qian Dong’s place,”Cen Shaoqing answered. ”

Zhou Xiang frowned slightly. “Why are you still looking for Qian Dong at this time of Night?”

The sound of a car engine came from outside the door.

Not long after.

The car was parked downstairs in Li Qian Dong’s apartment.

The lights in the apartment were on.

“When Cen Shaoqing came in, Li Qiandong was sitting on the sofa watching the live broadcast. ”

On the screen.

A female streamer wearing a bunny outfit was twisting and turning in front of the camera.

She had a very good figure.

She was also very beautiful.

Li Qiandong had given her 20 sports cars.

“The streamer immediately said coquettishly, “Thank you for the sports car, young master Li. I love you for 10,000 years. In order to thank young master Li for the sports car, let me sing a song for Young Master Li? I wonder what song young master Li Likes to listen to? “After I finish singing, if young master Li thinks that I’m singing pretty well, how about giving a few sports cars to your sister?” ”

Li Qiandong typed in the title of the song.

The host immediately sang.

“As he sang, he made flirtatious glances, heart gestures, and kisses in front of the screen. ”

Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly.

This host was far inferior to Ye Zhuo.

Ye Zao had never asked for gifts from his fans.

Nor had he ever worn such revealing clothes.

Nor would he do such strange actions.

Vulgar.

It was really too vulgar.

“Cen Shaoqing averted his gaze. He, who had always kept a straight face, had a rare look of disgust in his eyes. ”

“Qian Dong.”

The sudden voice gave Li Qian Dong a fright. “Fifth brother? When did you come?”

“I just arrived.”Cen Shaoqing spun the prayer beads.

“Li Qiandong quickly jumped down from the sofa and said, “Fifth brother, you came to look for me for something, right?” ”

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

Li Qiandong poured cen shaoqing a glass of water.

Cen Shaoqing declined politely.

“Seeing that Cen Shaoqing wasn’t drinking, Li Qiandong drank it himself. “Fifth brother, what did you come to look for me for?” ”

“Cen Shaoqing continued, “Teach me how to play games.” ”

What?

Play games?

“Cen Shaoqing, who was devoted to Buddhism, actually asked him to teach him how to play games? ”

“Li Qiandong suspected that he was hearing things, and he spat out all the water in his mouth. ”

“”Fifth brother, did I hear it right? Play Games?”Li Qiandong casually wiped his hands with his sleeve. ” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“”Yes, play games.”Cen Shaoqing looked serious. ”

“Li Qiandong said incredulously, “Fifth brother, you don’t have a fever, do you?” ”

“No.”Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads. “I’m very serious.”

Li Qiandong was even more incredulous.

He sized Cen Shaoqing up and down.

Everything was fine.

Why did Cen Shaoqing want to learn to play games?

Was he crazy?

Or was he possessed?

“Cen Shaoqing leaned over and sat on the sofa. “Hurry up, I don’t have much time.” ”

“Li Qiandong also quickly sat down. “Fifth brother, which game are you going to Learn?” ”

“King.”

“”King?”Li Qiandong looked at Cen Shaoqing. “Fifth brother, are you serious?” ”

“Cen Shaoqing placed the Buddha beads on the table and took out his phone. “I’ve already downloaded the game. Teach me how to dress, move, and think.” ”

Li Qiandong was stunned.

What was wrong with Cen Shaoqing today?

“”Fifth brother, are you infatuated with any streamer?”Li Qiandong asked. ”

Cen Shaoqing’s expression did not change. “No.”

Li Qiandong narrowed his eyes. “Then why did you suddenly learn this?”

“”To keep up with the times,”Cen Shaoqing said concisely. ”

Li Qiandong looked at him suspiciously and did not ask further.

He began to teach Cen Shaoqing how to play games.

Cen Shaoqing was very smart.

He understood everything at once.

“In a short while, he became an expert in the valley. ”

An hour later.

Li Qiandong sent Cen Shaoqing away.

He returned home.

Cen Shaoqing turned on the livestream again.

It was a pity.

Ye Zhuo had already logged out.

How could he log out so soon?

“Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly. He picked up the computer, wrote a script, and installed it on his phone. ”

“This way, even if he did not add ye Zhuo as a friend in the game, he would still be able to match ye Zhuo. ”

“When they matched, they would still be able to match ye Zhuo. ”

...

“After learning that ye Zhuo was the top scorer in Yunjing City, an Lizi and Zhao Pingting were especially happy. The two of them quickly logged into their school forum accounts and posted on the forum to mock the person who had plagiarized ye Zhuo. ”
