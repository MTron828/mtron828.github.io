He didn’t expect that an eastern girl who looked so young would be so powerful!

“”I’m sorry, I know it’s not polite, but I still want to ask, What’s Your Name?”Mr. Embert saw that ye Zhuo was so young, so he didn’t take ye Zhuo seriously at all. ”

“Naturally, he did not pay attention to her name. ”

“My Name Is Ye Zhuo.”

“Mr. Embert stood up and walked in front of Ye Zhuo. He reached out his hand to her and said in fluent mandarin, “Hello, Miss Ye. Nice to meet you.” ”

Ye Sen and Xiao Hu were stunned as they did not expect Mr. Embert to suddenly speak Mandarin.

Their eyes were filled with disbelief!

Ye Zhuo calmly shook hands with Embert. “It’s my honor to know you.”

Embert turned to look at his assistant. “Go out and tell them that we’ve found a partner. Tell them not to wait in line anymore.”

The assistant nodded. “Okay.”

The assistant went out and told him about this matter. The various companies that had been waiting in line were instantly enraged.

Which Company was working with Toaeon?

“After all, the most competitive wind speed company and Mingde company had yet to go on stage! ”

“In fact, wind speed company and Mingde company were also very confused! ”

“Just a moment ago, they had thought of each other as their competitors. ”

“Unexpectedly, they had lost before this had even begun! ”

“Other than them, could it be that there were other companies that were more powerful than them? ”

This was too strange!

“Because Mr. Embert was speaking Mandarin throughout the entire process, upon hearing this, Ye Sen and Xiao Hu looked at each other and saw the disbelief in each other’s eyes! ”

No one had expected that ye Zao had actually won the cooperation.

This was too amazing!

Ye Sen even pinched his thigh hard.

Hiss —

It really hurt!

It wasn’t a dream.

It was real!

It was already six o’clock in the evening when the cooperation was discussed.

“Mr. Embert admired ye Zao very much. He even wanted to Poach ye Zao to Toaeon Company. When he found out that ye Zao was still a senior in high school, he was even more shocked. He gave ye Zao a thumbs up and said, “Your China is really full of talents!” ”

“In the past, Embert always had a prejudice against China. ”

“He thought that there were no particularly powerful people in China, and they were not as powerful as country P in all aspects. After seeing ye Zao today, he finally understood the foundation of a big country! ”

This kind of foundation of a big country would not disappear no matter how many wars it had gone through!

It was worthy of respect!

“Until he walked out of Toaeon with the contract, Ye Sen still felt that it was especially unreal. ”

They had actually gotten the cooperation case of TOAEON!

“At this time, the news of Shengdong Express getting the cooperation case of Toaeon was also spread among the major express delivery companies. ”

“No one had expected that TOAEON would choose such a small, unknown company. ”

“Hearing this news, Xu Dadong, who was talking to his friend, was stunned. “Which Company do you think Toaeon signed with? Wind speed or Mingde?” ”

“”Neither!”His friend shook his head. “Speaking of which, you know the person in charge of this company! It’s Ye Sen from Shengdong Express!” ”

Pah —

The cigarette butt between Xu Dadong’s fingers fell on the table. He looked at his friend in disbelief. “You’re not mistaken?”

“”Don’t worry, I’m not mistaken! My sister works at the top level of wind speed. is what she said true?” ”

Xu Dadong felt a throbbing pain in his head.

“Because a few hours ago, he had mocked ye Zao for daydreaming. ”

He did not expect to be slapped in the face!

Xu Dadong stood up and walked out the door.

“Hey! Where are you going?”

“Xu Dadong said without turning his head, “To find Ye Sen!”He still did not believe it if he did not ask about this matter personally. ”

He really couldn’t understand why TOAEON would work with Sheng Dong?

It must be a mistake!

“Soon, Xu Dadong arrived at Ye Sen’s company. ”

“The front desk knew Xu Dadong, so they let him in directly. ” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Xu Dadong came all the way to Ye Sen’s office.

“Ye Sen saw Xu Dadong, who was sweating profusely, and was stunned at first. Then he said, “Why is President Xu Here? Is there something urgent?” ”

“Xu Dadong smiled and said, “Old Ye, I heard that you’ve taken down the Toaeon Company’s cooperation case! Congratulations!” ”

Ye Sen asked Xiao Hu to pour xu Dadong a glass of water. “CEO Xu’s news is fast enough!”

Hearing that.

Xu Dadong was immediately stunned.

His expression was unclear.

“He had originally thought that this was a misunderstanding, and saying these words would make ye Sen embarrassed. ”

He didn’t expect...

He didn’t expect to get it.

Toaeon’s list was worth at least seven figures!
