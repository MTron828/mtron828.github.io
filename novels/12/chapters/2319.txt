“Tang mi smiled and said, “Professor Zhang, your starting point is also for the sake of the base.” ”

“Little did she know that not far away, Wen Zhi had sneaked into the office and transmitted all the important information that Professor Zhang had given him back to Earth. ”

“When Kevin saw this information, he stood up from his chair in excitement and hurriedly ran out of the laboratory, all the way to Professor Mi Jia Di’s office. ”

“Seeing him like this, Mi Jia di immediately stood up and asked nervously, “Did something happen?” ”

“Yes!”Kevin nodded. “Something big!”

“Mi Jia di continued, “Ye Zhuo discovered Wen Zhi?” ”

Kevin chuckled. “Of course not!”

“Seeing Kevin like this, Mi Jia di heaved a sigh of relief. “Then what is it?” ”

Kevin handed the communicator to Mi Jiadi. “Take a look for yourself.”

“Mi Jiadi took the communicator. Her face was filled with shock. After a long while, she finally reacted. She raised her head and looked at Kevin. “Where did this come from?” ” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Kevin suppressed the excitement in his heart and continued, “Wenzhi sent it from Mars.” ”

“After saying that, he added, “Professor, Can We Start Plan B Now? Let’s make another bet with China and take back the base that belongs to us in one GO!” ”

“What if we lose?”Mi Jia di asked in return.

“”Lose?”Kevin’s face was full of disbelief, and there was even a hint of ridicule. “How can we lose? Do you think ye Zao can still climb back up?” ”

Unless ye Zao had three heads and six arms!

“Kevin continued, “The current situation will only get worse and worse. Professor, if you don’t come to a conclusion, our base will really never be taken back!”As long as he thought about the base that originally belonged to country c.., but the right to use it had become China’s, Kevin felt extremely humiliated! ”

“Since the founding of country C, there had never been such a thing. ”

Mi Jiadi narrowed her eyes. “Let me think about it again.”

“Seeing how indecisive Dr. Mi Jiadi was, Kevin was extremely anxious. ”

It was now or never.

“”Doctor, don’t think about it anymore!”Kevin continued, “While the CEN’s base is in a mess, let’s hurry up and sign the BET agreement. If one day our intelligence is exposed, we won’t be able to sign it even if we wanted to!” ”

Mi Jiadi turned around and looked at Kevin. “Don’t you think that things were very wrong from the start?”

The progress was a little too smooth.

“With Mi Jiadi’s understanding of Ye Zao, Ye Zao should not be so stupid. ”

“Kevin continued, “Are you still suspecting that ye Zao is acting?” ”

“”Yes.”Mi Jiadi nodded. “Ye Zao is not an ordinary person to begin with. If this is her deception, then our C Nation’s technology will never be able to hold its head up in front of the rest of the world!” ”

“If ye Zao was an ordinary person, he would not have created a legend that belonged to China’s aircraft carrier by himself. ”

“Mi Jiadi continued, “I think we still need to carefully consider this matter.” ”

“Seeing Mi Jiadi being so submissive, an evil fire ignited in Kevin’s heart. ”

A person like Mi Jiadi would never be able to stand out in her entire life.

No one knew how he got to his current position.

“”Doctor, time is limited. We really can’t think about it anymore!”Kevin suppressed the anger in his heart, “We have to sign the betting agreement immediately. The era that belongs to Ye Zhuo has passed. Her ability to create an aircraft carrier is already a miracle machine. A person can not create miracles forever! There is a saying in China that goes, ‘when a man’s talents run out, he will run out.’the current ye Zhuo is that man! “There are all kinds of medicines in this world, but there is no medicine for regret, doctor! “Wake up!” ”

“Mi Jiadi was very clear-headed now. It was precisely because she was clear-headed that she was hesitating. She turned her head to look at Kevin, “Calm down first and think carefully. If this document is really that important, can wen Zhi, a mere assistant, get it?” ”

This kind of encrypted file should be under strict supervision.

“But now, it was actually taken by Wen Zhi! ”

Wen Zhi was just a mere assistant.

“”Professor, now is not the time for you to worry about this or that. The most important thing now is to sign the betting agreement and take back the base that belongs to us! “Why don’t you understand?”Kevin continued, “You have no idea how chaotic Mars is now! They only want to solve the problem at hand right now. How can they have the mood to investigate other things! “Moreover, this document was originally meant for Yu Zifei. Wen Zhi is Yu Zifei’s assistant. Is it difficult for people to understand that Wen Zhi gave something to Yu Zifei through his hands?” ”
