Translator: 549690339

Old Mrs. Cen was not joking with Cen Shaoqing.

“Cen Haifeng had abandoned his wife and son, causing Zhou Xiang to wait for him for so many years in vain. Yet, in the blink of an eye, he had another lover in the alliance. ”

Was he worthy of Zhou Xiang?

“Although she was Cen Haifeng’s mother, she would not help her family. Moreover, she was also in the game. ” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“According to Cen Shaoqing, Cen Shaoqing’s grandfather was just like Cen Haifeng... ”

“When she thought of this, the anger in Old Mrs. Cen’s heart was greater than her sadness. ”

“Although she was old and the Cen family’s old man had passed away for so many years, she had always thought that she and the Cen family’s Old Man were true love. ”

She had never thought...

It was simply laughable.

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “You should have killed him! This kind of person doesn’t deserve to live in this world!” ”

“At this point, old Mrs. Cen seemed to have suddenly thought of something. She turned to look at Cen Shaoqing and narrowed her eyes. “You won’t be like your father in the future, will you?” ”

“What are you talking about!”Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly. “How can I Be Like Him?”

“Old Mrs. Cen raised her walking stick. “If you dare to be like that unfilial son, I will break your legs and beat your dog head!” ”

“”Don’t worry, I will never be a heartless person.”Cen Shaoqing’s tone was indifferent, but it was sonorous and forceful. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen snorted coldly, “You men, your words are better than your singing! Your grandfather said that he would give up everything for me, and your father also treated your mother as a treasure in his hands. But in the end? I can finally see that men are all heartless dogs!” ”

“Cen Shaoqing could not refute her words. After all, his grandfather and father had indeed done such things. ”

“The most disgusting thing is the General Alliance! This kind of broken country should not exist!”Old Mrs. Cen used her walking stick to knock the ground loudly. “These women of the CEN family have been ruined by them!”

“Old Mrs. Cen’s mother-in-law was widowed at the age of 30, and her mother-in-law was widowed at the age of 26. She had been widowed at a young age for several years. She had thought that this was fate, but who would have thought that it was all man-made? ”

“At this moment, a servant came in with the family doctor. “Old Mrs. Cen, Doctor Qiu is here.” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen immediately put away the anger on her face and immediately went up to him. “Doctor Qiu, Please Check on my daughter-in-law. Is She Alright?” ”

“”Okay, old Mrs. Cen, don’t be anxious.” ”

“Doctor Qiu nodded, put down the medical box, and took out the stethoscope to diagnose Zhou Xiang. ”

The three CEN sisters stood anxiously at the side.

“After a moment, doctor Qiu put down the stethoscope. ”

“CEN yuying immediately asked, “Doctor Qiu, is My Mother Alright?” ”

“”It’s nothing serious.”Doctor Qiu shook his head and continued, “Mrs. Cen is mainly anxious. I’ll prescribe a prescription for her to recuperate. She’ll be fine in a few days.” ”

“Hearing this, Cen Yuying was relieved. She smiled and said, “Thank you, Doctor Qiu.” ”

“You’re too kind. This is what I should do.”Doctor Qiu put away the medical kit.

Old Mrs. Cen personally sent Doctor Qiu out.

“Inside the room, Cen Yuying walked to Cen Shaoqing’s side and asked in a low voice, “Shaoqing, what’s going on? Look at how scared you are of Mom! is our dad really still alive?” ”

Cen Yuying felt that this matter was a little mysterious.

Cen Haifeng had been missing for twenty years. Could it be that he was really brought back by someone outside the Milky Way?

“It’s true.”Cen Shaoqing continued.

“Cen Yuying frowned slightly. “But don’t you think this matter is very incredible? Could it be that they just happen to look alike? The world is so big that there are all kinds of strange things...”just like Old Lady Cen.., cen Yuying now hoped that Cen Haifeng had really passed away. How would things end up like this in the future? ”

“Besides, this wasn’t fair to Zhou Xiang! ”

Cen Shaoqing didn’t say anything. He took out a photo and handed it to Cen Yuying. “Look at this.”

Cen Yuying took the photo.

The Man in the photo was elegant and handsome. The woman was gentle and careful. The man was talented and the woman was beautiful.

This...

“Young...”

“Cen Yuying was about to speak when CEN Shaoqing continued, “I went to do a paternity test.”The rest of his words were self-evident. ”

CEN yuying frowned tightly.

Cen Yueya and Cen Yueying walked over from the side. The two sisters also had worried looks on their faces.

“”Shaoqing, you are the pillar of the family. Give us an idea. What should we do now?”Cen Yueying said. ”

Cen Yueya nodded.

“”Give the choice to Mom,”Cen Shaoqing said slowly. ”

“CEN yuying continued, “You mean, no matter what mom chooses, we all support mom unconditionally?” ”

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.
