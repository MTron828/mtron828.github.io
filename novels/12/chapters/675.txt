Translator: 549690339

“When she heard that old Mrs. Lin knew the old man, Lin Qingxuan was even more confused. She then asked, “Mom, who was that Auntie just now? How come I’ve never seen her before?” ”

“Isn’t she that crazy woman from the Ye family!”Old Mrs. Lin answered.

“The crazy woman from the Ye Family? Who is that?”Lin Qingxuan had a face full of question marks.

“Old Mrs. Lin explained, “She’s XI Muwen’s first wife.” ”

“Lin Qingxuan frowned and said in disbelief, “She’s the Ye family’s Patriarch’s Daughter? Aunt Lang? !” ”

“Old Mrs. Lin nodded. “It’s her. After she went missing for half a month, ye Langhua became mentally ill. I heard that she often got sick and started throwing tantrums everywhere. It’s a good thing that she didn’t blame us just now! Otherwise, it would have been really bad luck!” ” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Who would have thought that she would meet this crazy woman as soon as she was discharged from the hospital today? It seemed that she would have to cross a brazier to get rid of her bad luck after she went back.

“Hearing this, Lin Qingxuan sighed endlessly. ”

“Who would have thought that the person with a head full of gorgeous hair just now was actually ye Langhua, the proud daughter of Heaven from back then. ”

“Although he was still young at that time, he knew everything about the Ye family. ”

“Back then, ye Langhua was one of the most beautiful women in the capital! ”

“Not only was she talented, but she was also beautiful. ”

There were countless people who pursued her.

“Who knew that ye Langhua did not take a fancy to anyone in the end. Instead, she took a fancy to the penniless XI Muwen and invited him over. ”

“When they found out that ye Langhua took a fancy to the penniless xi muwen, the nobles of the four or nine cities could not help but sigh. ”

“After all, what kind of person could a talented and beautiful girl like Ye Langhua not marry? ”

“Even if she married into the family, there would still be people coming after her. ”

“However, ye Langhua was completely devoted to XI Muwen. In desperation, the old patriarch of the Ye family had no choice but to help the two of them. ”

“The second year after ye Langhua and Xi Muwen got married, they gave birth to a cute daughter. ”

“Later on, Ye Langhua lost her biological daughter in an accident. The old patriarch of the Ye family could not bear the blow and suddenly suffered a cerebral hemorrhage and died. Ye Langhua worked day and night to find her daughter, so she did not have time to manage the company’s matters, from then on, she fell into a slump. ”

The Ye group was changed by Xi Muwen into Xi Empire.

“Lin Qingxuan continued to ask, “It’s been so many years, and Aunt Lang still hasn’t found her biological daughter, Xiao Banyue?” ”

Old Mrs. Lin shook her head. “She’s probably dead already! How can she still be found?”

“It had been more than thirty years. Lin Qingxuan thought that ye Langhua had already found her daughter, but she did not expect that ye Langhua still had not found her daughter! ”

“”Mom, don’t talk nonsense! She is definitely fine! Maybe she is looking for Aunt Lang Now!” ”

“Old Lady Lin’s eyes were full of disdain, “A mother will give birth to a daughter like that. Ye Langhua is so stupid, how good can her daughter be? Even if she is still alive, she is probably as stupid as ye Langhua! She has no prospects!” ”

“If ye Langhua wasn’t stupid, would she have lost her own daughter? ”

“If ye Langhua wasn’t stupid, would she have become like this? ”

“If ye Langhua wasn’t stupid, would she have taken a liking to a person like Xi Muwen? ”

“In short, ye Langhua was still stupid. The reason why she became like this was all her own doing. ”

There was nothing to sympathize with such a person!

“Lin Qingxuan frowned. “Mom, your words are too harsh! It wasn’t Aunt Lang who wanted to lose half a month! After half a month went missing, as a mother, wasn’t it her duty to look for her daughter?” ”

Old Lady Lin rolled her eyes at Lin Qingxuan. “How was my words harsh? She was stupid and didn’t let anyone say anything?”

“”Mom, I remember that you had a good relationship with Aunt Lang back then, right?”Lin Qingxuan turned to look at Old Lady Lin. ”

“Before the Ye family was in trouble, Old Lady Lin’s relationship with ye Langhua was indeed good. ”

“Ever since the Ye family was in trouble, Old Lady Lin and ye Langhua had completely cut off all contact because Old Lady Lin never wasted her time on useless people. ”

“Old Lady Lin turned her head and denied, “Who has a good relationship with such a fool? You’ve remembered wrongly!” ”

“”Aunt Lang is, after all, a strange woman of a generation,”Lin Qingxuan continued, “Don’t call her a fool. It’s too ugly.” ”

“With ye Langhua’s popularity in the capital back then, it was not an exaggeration to describe her as a ‘Strange Woman’. ”

“”If you think it’s ugly, cover your ears!” ”

Lin Qingxuan did not say anything else and continued driving.

“Old Madam Lin felt a little uncomfortable. Ever since Lin Qingxuan came to the hospital to pick her up, she did not say a word of greeting. She did not even care about her condition. Instead, she argued with her for so long on behalf of a crazy woman. ”
