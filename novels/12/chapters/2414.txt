“”But if it wasn’t for me, she wouldn’t have thought of going back! It’s my fault! It’s all my fault!”Susan cried. ”

“”It’s really not your fault!”Jerry continued, “It’s not that I didn’t stop Elena. I even tried to use the same trick to make Elena drink water, but she refused.” ”

“Hearing that, Susan looked at Jerry, “You also poured her sleeping water?” ”

Jerry nodded. “But all of you are determined to go back. I had no choice but to think of this method.”

“Susan wiped her tears. If that was really the case, then it was fate! ”

Elena was also unlucky. She had just returned to L continent when a riot broke out.

She watched helplessly as the strange beast swallowed several people in front of her.

“Elena ran as fast as she could to the entrance area, but she was still a step too late. ”

The entrance was already closed!

“At this moment, L continent had become a true cage. ”

Her ears were filled with shouts and screams.

It was especially terrifying.

...

On the other side.

Ye Zhuo sat in front of the observation platform and observed the current situation of L continent through the holographic technology. He frowned slightly.

These exotic beasts were more terrifying than she had imagined.

“When they were still single-celled, they might have been afraid of potassium carbonate, but now they had almost no weaknesses. ”

“Whether it was potassium carbonate or wind, rain, thunder, or lightning, they could absorb them all. ”

And they were constantly growing.

“Ye Zao raised her hand and pressed on her temple. She turned to Dr. Zhang and asked, “Has the S-2 virus been developed yet?” ”

“Not yet.”Dr. Zhang shook his head.

“After saying that, Dr. Zhang continued, “Can the S-2 virus really subdue these exotic beasts?” ”

“I don’t know either.”Ye Zao’s expression was a little complicated. “We can only give it a try now.”

“Dr. Zhang looked at the holographic image and said, “Miss Ye, why don’t we forget about them? Don’t worry about them! You said that there was a problem with those things back then. They didn’t listen to you!” ”

“If the people of L continent had listened to ye Zao’s words, they wouldn’t have ended up like this. ”

They had brought this upon themselves.

“Ye Zao continued, “But they are all fresh human lives.” ”

“Although he could not interfere in such matters, ye Zao could not watch as those lives disappeared one after another. ”

Professor Zhang Sighed.

“As a researcher, professor Zhang couldn’t stand it. However, he was afraid that he would be dragged into the mess if he couldn’t save them. ”

“After all, China was safe now. ”

“If there was even the slightest problem, China would become a second hell on Earth. ” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“”Miss Ye,”professor Zhang turned to look at ye Zao and said, “What if... what if those exotic beasts break through the defense system when we release S-2?” ”

“”I’ll think of a way,”ye Zao said. ”

She would definitely not put herself in danger.

Dr. Zhang nodded. “Then I’ll go and urge the laboratory again.”

“Okay.”

L continent.

“Mario and William had not slept for a day and a night, and they finally succeeded in repairing the communicator. ”

“Looking at the communicator that was beeping, Mario was so happy that he almost cried! ”

William’s face was also filled with disbelief.

He had never thought that it would actually be fixed!

“After all, he had only wanted to console Mario at that time. ”

“”Alright! Alright!”The two of them hugged each other in excitement, suddenly forgetting all the pain. “We’re saved!” ”

“In a flash, the two of them let go of each other, and Mario began to contact ye Zao. ”

“Before contacting ye Zao, Mario had already mentally prepared himself. ”

“After all, he was the one who had taken ye Zao’s good intentions for granted. ”

“Therefore, even if ye Zao’s words were unpleasant, he would still endure it. ”

“Very quickly, the other party picked up. ”

Ye Zao’s face appeared on the transparent screen.

“Miss Ye!”

Mario hurriedly called out.

“Ye Zao nodded slightly. “Doctor Mario, are you guys Alright Now?” ”

“Mario was stunned for a moment. He had thought that ye Zao would be mocking him. However, the first thing ye Zao said was to say hello. ”

“”I’m fine,”Mario said. ”

“”That’s good.”Ye Zao continued, “You guys take good care of yourselves. We’re already researching the virus to conquer the exotic beasts. We’ll try our best to deliver it within three days.” ”

Mario looked at ye Zao in disbelief. How could he have imagined that ye Zao would take the initiative to help them solve their problems before he could even speak.

“At this moment, Mario’s heart was filled with displeasure. His eyes reddened as he looked at ye Zao and said, “Miss Ye, I’m sorry.” ”

“William, who was by the side, had never imagined that things would end up like this. ”

Ye Zao had exceeded his expectations.

He had originally thought that ye Zao would no longer bother with them.

“”Things have already happened. There’s no point in saying sorry.”Ye Zao continued, “The most important thing for all of you right now is how to survive these three days!” ”

“Three days wasn’t long, but it wasn’t short either. ”

“Against that group of exotic beasts, humans simply didn’t have any ability to attack. Once they were targeted by the exotic beasts, there would only be one outcome. ”

Waiting for death.

“It was very cruel, but it was also very realistic. ”

“Hearing ye Zhuo’s words, Mario’s expression became a little desolate. However, he quickly said, “Miss Ye, don’t worry. I will definitely protect everyone!” ”

“He was the one who had caused this matter, so he would be the one to end it! ”

Even if he had to risk his life.

“And me!”William stood behind Mario. “We will definitely be able to survive for three days together!”

“Ye Zao looked at the two of them and continued, “I will also speed up my progress and try my best to release the virus that will conquer the exotic beasts within a short period of time.” ”
