“To have a talent like her serve tea and water to a little girl, wasn’t that an insult? ”

“Director Zhou continued, “How about this, you arrange for the patient in your hands to be assigned to doctor Liu.” ”

Su Zishan was the child of a friend of director Zhou’s.

Letting Su Zishan be the team leader of Team A and listen to Ye Zao’s orders was actually opening a back door for Su Zishan. The others were not blessed with such luck.

Once ye Zao cured the cancer.

“As Su Zishan’s assistant, Ye Zao would definitely impart the treatment plan to Su Zishan without any reservations. ”

“As the second person in the world who could cure cancer, at that time, her status would also rise along with the tide. ”

“However, Su Zishan did not know how blessed she was. “No, I have to be responsible for my own patients. I Won’t be at ease leaving it to others.” ”

“Director Zhou continued, “Doctor Su, this is a rare opportunity for you. I hope you can seriously consider it.” ”

“Su Zishan said with disdain, “Thank you, director Zhou, for your love. However, you should leave this opportunity to those who need it!” ”

“Since that was the case, director Zhou did not insist. He continued, “Then, who here is willing to volunteer to be the team leader of Group A?” ”

The moment he said that.

The entire meeting room was silent.

No one was willing to speak.

No one believed that there was anyone in this world who could cure cancer.

Let them be an assistant to a young girl?

What kind of joke was this?

“”Director Zhou, let me do it.”A bespectacled female doctor with scholarly features stood up. “I’m willing to be the team leader of Group A to cooperate with Miss Ye’s work.” ”

“This female doctor was called Gu Dening. She was 26 years old this year and was usually modest. Other than not having any experience of studying abroad, she had received many awards. ”

“”Doctor Gu, have you considered it?”Director Zhou looked at Gu Dening. ”

“Yes.”Gu dening nodded.

“Director Zhou nodded in satisfaction. “Then let doctor Gu be the team leader of Team A. the rest of you don’t have any objections, right?” ”

“No.”

“”If not, then the meeting is adjourned.”Director Zhou continued, “Dr. Su, come to my office in a while.” ”

“Okay.”Su Zishan nodded.

“After the meeting was adjourned, Su Zishan came to director Zhou’s office. ”

“There were no outsiders in the office, director Zhou said, “Zishan, your father and I have been old friends for many years. He previously instructed me to take care of you in the hospital. This opportunity is really rare! “I believe that Miss Ye will definitely be able to cure cancer. How about this? You will be the leader of Group A, and doctor Xiao Gu will be the deputy leader. What do you think?” ”

“Su Zishan smiled and said, “Uncle Zhou, thank you for your kindness. I appreciate your kindness! “But I really don’t want to get involved in this mess. I heard that the little girl surnamed ye is only nineteen this year! I Don’t care if you believe her or not, I won’t believe her anyway! I advise you not to believe this kind of fantasy. Although the patient’s family has signed a waiver for us, once the treatment plan fails, this matter will have some impact on our hospital!” ”

This was cancer.

It wasn’t a cold. Just taking some medicine would be enough to get better.

“If cancer could really be cured so easily, there would not be so many people who would lose their lives due to cancer every year. ”

“Director Zhou continued, “Zishan, I’ve already said it to you. If you regret it, there will be no medicine for you to take.”He and Zishan’s father were old friends after all, now that everything was clear, it was Zishan who wanted to reject it. When that time came, Zishan’s father would not have any reason to blame him. ”

“Su Zishan’s eyes flashed with sarcasm. “Uncle Zhou, don’t worry. I will never regret it. As for you, once the matter is settled, you can’t regret it!” ”

“Director Zhou smiled and said, “Zishan, your uncle Zhou has crossed more bridges than you have. I believe in Miss Ye’s ability.” ”

“”Uncle Zhou, haven’t you heard of a saying?” ”

“What saying?”Dean Zhou asked.

“A wise man is a fool for a time.”

To say that Dean Zhou was a wise man is a fool for a time was all polite words.

“In Su Zishan’s eyes, Dean Zhou was a fool for old age! ”

“If he wasn’t a fool for old age, would he have been deceived by a little girl? ”

“It was one thing for him to be deceived by others, but now he wanted to pull her along to be deceived! ”

Did he really think that her five years of study was for nothing? Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Dean Zhou smiled and did not explain.
