“Li Yueyue said, “Da Zao’s boyfriend is here! He’s right below our dormitory!” ”

“Really?”Mi Lu was also very surprised.

Li Yueyue nodded.

Ye Zao tied his shoelaces. “I’m going downstairs now. Do you two want to come down with me to take a look?”

“Mi Lu said, “You’re going on a date with your brother-in-law. Why are we going to join in the fun? Yueyue and I can just stand on the balcony and take a look.” ”

“Alright then. I’ll get my boyfriend to treat you to a meal after the holidays. I’ll go down first.”

“Go ahead.”Li Yueyue waved at ye Zao.

Ye Zao’s figure had just disappeared into the corridor when Mi Lu and Li Yueyue rushed to the balcony impatiently. “Where? Where? where is Big Zao’s boyfriend?”

“”Yueyue, do you think it’s that one?” ”

“Which one?”

“Milo pointed to a man standing under a tree and said, “It’s the one standing under the tree wearing a black down jacket.” ”

“Li Yueyue shook her head. “It shouldn’t be! That one seems a little greasy! And he’s wearing tight pants, isn’t it?” ”

“What about that one?”

“”That one is too white, just like a gigolo. It’s definitely not him.”Li Yueyue still shook her head. ”

“At this moment, ye Zao walked out of the dormitory building. ”

“Milo said excitedly, “He’s coming, he’s coming! Zao Zao is coming out!” ”

“As soon as ye Zao came out, a tall and straight figure walked over from the side. He wore a long gown and a plain clothes. His body was like a jade tree. His facial features were extremely cold. His entire body emitted a noble and cold aura, as if he had walked out of a painting. ”

The students walking around all looked at him.

“Li Yueyue’s eyes were about to pop out stars. “F * ck! F * ck! This is the best in the world! This can’t be Big Zao’s boyfriend, right?” ”

Milo was also stunned.

“Although she had already prepared for ye Zao’s boyfriend to be extraordinary, she did not expect that there was someone in this world who could be so perfect. ”

It was simply a sigh!

“I think it’s very similar. This must be Zao Zao’s boyfriend!”

“Compared to the man in front of her, the few boys she had pointed at earlier were simply too weak. ”

“In Milo’s opinion, only this man in front of her could match up to Ye Zao. ”

Cen Shaoqing walked in front of ye Zao and extended his hand to her. “Are you cold?”

Ye Zao extended his hand to him. “It’s okay. It’s not very cold.”

“On a snowy day, although Cen Shaoqing was dressed very thinly, the temperature of his palm was very high. ”

“Ye Zao had a cold body. In winter, no matter what he wore, his hands and feet would be very cold. ”

“At this moment, one was cold and the other was hot. Her hand was being warmed up by him bit by bit. ”

Ye Zao tilted his head to look at him. “Are we going to He ziteng’s place today?”

“”Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly and continued, “When are you guys going to take the exam?” ”

“Next Wednesday.”

“Seeing this scene, Li Yueyue and Milo’s teenage hearts were about to explode. “They’re holding hands! They’re holding hands! They’re holding hands!” ”

“Li Yueyue hurriedly covered Milo’s mouth. “Keep your voice down. If da Zhuoluo hears this, she’ll definitely be embarrassed!” ”

“”Oh, right!”Milo also reacted at this time. ”

The two of them watched as ye Zhuluo and Cen Shaoqing left the dormitory building hand in hand.

“Driving was not allowed on the campus of Jing University, so Cen Shaoqing’s car stopped at the school gate. ”

Cen Shaoqing opened the door of the front passenger seat.

“Ye Zhuluo sat in the car. Just as he fastened his seatbelt, a good-looking hand handed him a cup of hot milk tea. ”

“You bought it?”Ye Zao tilted his head and looked at Cen Shaoqing.

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “Let’s go to Ziteng’s house and watch a movie after having a barbecue.”

“Sure.”Ye Zao nodded.

“”Let’s go to have hotpot after watching the movie,”Cen Shaoqing continued. ”

He wanted to do all the things that ye Zao had done with his two roommates yesterday.

“Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly. “Cen Shaoqing, are you jealous of my roommates?” ” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Cen Shaoqing’s expression was the same as usual. He opened his thin lips slightly. “No.”

Ye Zao took a sip of the milk tea. “Really?”

Cen Shaoqing held the steering wheel with both hands and looked straight ahead. “Really.”

“Ye Zao smiled and continued, “Let’s go to He ziteng’s place. Do you want to buy something?” ”

Buy Something?

“Other than buying things for ye Zao’s relatives, Cen Shaoqing had never bought anything for anyone else. ”

“”There’s no need,”cen shaoqing continued, “Even if we buy it, he wouldn’t dare to accept it.” ”

...

He ziteng had a lot of friends today.

“At this moment, the sunny room on the second floor was very lively. Everyone gathered together and chatted and laughed. ”
