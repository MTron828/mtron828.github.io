Translator: 549690339

Bai Yuanyuan was like a foil to Bai Mo. .

“Are you so sure it’s Bai Mo? What if it’s Bai Jingshu?”Someone said in a low voice.

“Bai Jingshu? Are You Dreaming? Who in the S Galaxy doesn’t know that Bai Jingshu is marrying an Earthling?”

Master Bai was waiting for Old Lady Shangguan’s answer.

“Old Lady Shangguan smiled and said, “It’s your eldest granddaughter, Bai Jingshu.” ”

Bai Jingshu!

It was actually Bai Jingshu!

“As soon as she said this, the air instantly quieted down. ”

How could it be Bai Jingshu?

Bai Mo’s eyes widened as she stared at Old Lady Shangguan in disbelief.

She couldn’t figure out why this person was Bai Jingshu?

What right did she have to be Bai Jingshu?

“Bai Mo clenched his fists tightly. Because he had used too much strength, his knuckles had turned slightly white. ”

Why was it always like this!

“Ever since she was young, no matter what happened, Bai Jingshu would always come and interfere. ”

“It was like this in the past, and it was still like this now. ”

Fortunately.

“Fortunately, Bai Jingshu had already met Lin Ze. ”

“With Bai Jingshu’s personality, she would never compromise with Old Lady Shangguan. After all, in the eyes of this idiot, Bai Jingshu, only Lin Ze was her true love. ”

“Otherwise, she wouldn’t have fallen out with the Zhou family back then. ”

“Thinking of this, Bai Mo’s mood slightly improved. ”

“Old Master Bai was also stunned. He turned to look at Old Lady Shangguan and said with some embarrassment, “Old lady, it’s really unfortunate. Jingshu has already been married to someone. Today is the day they get married...” ”

“Old Lady Shangguan smiled and interrupted old master Bai’s unfinished words. She continued, “May I ask if the person eldest Miss Bai is going to marry is Lin Ze?” ”

“Yes.”Old Master Bai nodded.

“Old Lady Shangguan continued, “That’s right. The heir of our Shangguan family is Lin Ze. “My betrothal gift is for Ah Ze, and so is Ah Ze’s child. He’s about to get married, but he didn’t inform me of such an important matter and neglected Miss Bai. I’m really sorry!” ”

The decision to appoint Lin Ze as the heir of the Shangguan family was not old lady Shangguan’s willful decision.

She thought about it for a long time.

“In the end, she felt that Lin Ze was the most suitable. ”

“Although Lin Ze was born on Earth, his ability was not inferior to anyone born in the F Galaxy. ”

“Most importantly, Lin Ze had saved her, and Lin Ze looked like her grandson. ”

The old lady had always felt that Lin Ze was sent by God to save the Shangguan family.

“After thinking about it, the old lady announced the news within the family. ”

Lin Ze was the heir of the Shangguan Family

What was going on?

“Hearing this, everyone was stunned. ”

Especially Bai Mo..

Her hands and feet were cold and her face was pale.

She had not expected Lin Ze to be the heir of the Shangguan family.

How could Lin Ze be the heir of the Shangguan Family?

Wrong!

Wrong!

There must be a mistake!

“At this moment, Bai Mo’s hands were shaking and her body was cold. ”

“Bai Yuanyuan also felt that it was a little unbelievable, holding Bai Mo’s hand, she said, “Mo Mo, don’t be anxious. I think they must have made a mistake. It’s just that they have the same name and surname. Lin Ze is an earthling. How can he be worthy of being the heir of the Shangguan Family?” ”

“In this world, there were many people with the same name and surname. After all, Old Lady Shangguan was old, so it was very normal to mix them up. ”

“Old Master Bai also felt that Old Lady Shangguan had made a mistake. Just as he was about to say something, the sound of firecrackers suddenly came from outside the door. ”

It was Lin Ze!

“Old Lady Shangguan smiled and said, “Is the groom here to pick up the bride?” ”

“I think so.”Old Master Bai nodded.

Old Lady Shangguan immediately walked out.

Old Master Bai followed Old Lady Shangguan’s footsteps.

“When the two of them came outside, it was indeed Lin Ze in wedding clothes. ”

“Ah Ze!”Old Lady Shangguan immediately went up to greet him.

“When he saw Old Lady Shangguan, Lin Ze was also stunned. “Grandma, Why are you here?” ”

“Old Lady Shangguan rebuked, “You Child, why didn’t you tell Grandma about such a big wedding?” ”

Lin Ze didn’t tell Old Lady Shangguan because he knew Old Lady Shangguan’s personality.

But he didn’t expect Old Lady Shangguan to still come.

“Seeing the interaction between the two, everyone, including Bai Mo, was completely dumbfounded. ”

No one had expected that the Lin Ze that Old Lady Shangguan was talking about was actually this Lin Ze.

What was going on?

How did Lin Ze suddenly become the heir of the Shangguan Family?

“Bai Mo’s face, which had finally calmed down, was now as white as a sheet of paper, and she was extremely uncomfortable. ”

What was this?

What was this?

Why had no one ever told her that Lin Ze was the heir to the Shangguan Family?

“If she had known this would happen, she would never have rejected Lin ze! ”

What should she do now?

“Lin Ze was the heir to the Shangguan family, so Bai Jingshu was the future mistress of the Shangguan Family? ”

What was she?

The position of mistress of the Shangguan family should belong to her!

No Way!

She was not willing. She was not willing to let her position be snatched away by Bai Jingshu!

Bai Mo’s eyes were filled with regret.

“Bai Jingshu, that B * Tch! ”

“All of this was her scheme. She knew that Lin Ze’s identity was not ordinary, so she deliberately approached him and snatched him away from her! ”

How could there be such a shameless person in the world!

No wonder!

No wonder Bai Jingshu was determined to marry Lin Ze.

So that was the reason.

How could she be so foolish as to make Bai Jingshu’s wedding dress.

“Bai Mo was so regretful that her intestines were turning green. She had always thought that she was smarter than Bai Jingshu, but it turned out that Bai Jingshu was the one who was the most scheming. ”

“Compared to Bai Jingshu, she was nothing? ”

Bai Mo wished that he could kill Bai Jingshu right away.

“Bai Yuanyuan, who was beside her, also felt that everything was unbelievable. If Bai Mo had dated Lin ze directly back then, wouldn’t the person who married Lin Ze now be Bai Mo? ”

Bai Mo had picked up a sesame seed and lost a watermelon!

“However, Bai Mo couldn’t be blamed for this. Who would have thought that the heir of the Shangguan family, who had been spreading rumors, was actually Lin Ze. ”

“”Mo Mo, don’t worry,”Bai Yuanyuan comforted her in a low voice. “Lin Ze doesn’t really like Bai Jingshu at all. The first person he met was you, and the person he liked was also you. There are so many things happening in this world every day. Even if he gets married, he can still get a divorce! “Moreover, you two are a couple!” ”

“In Bai Yuanyuan’s opinion, Bai Mo and Lin Ze were originally a couple. If it weren’t for Bai Jingshu’s interference, the two of them would not have separated. ”

“In terms of a mistress, Bai Jingshu was the real mistress. ”

“Hearing Bai Yuanyuan’s words, Bai Mo felt a little better. ” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

That’s right.

Lin Ze liked her. So what if Bai Jingshu married Lin ze now?

“As long as she said she was willing to marry him, Lin Ze would immediately turn back. By then, Bai Jingshu would be the next abandoned wife. ”

Bai Mo puffed out her chest and walked forward. “Mr. Lin is here. Sister has been waiting inside for a long time.”

Lin Ze nodded and walked inside.

Bai Mo looked at Lin Ze’s back in disbelief.

“How could Lin Ze’s back be so calm? Logically speaking, Lin Ze should have noticed that she had changed her address. ”

“Previously, she had been calling Lin ze brother-in-law to make him give up. Now, she was calling him Mr. Lin to let Lin Ze know that she had changed her mind. ”

But Lin Ze did not seem to have any reaction.

Bai Mo narrowed her eyes. She did not feel good.

She should not have
