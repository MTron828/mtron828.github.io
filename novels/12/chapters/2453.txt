Could it be...

Xiaotian really didn’t know about this.

“But Xiaotian was song Shiyu’s personal assistant after all. If even Xiaotian didn’t know, then who knew? ”

Who was the girl song Shiyu loved but couldn’t get?

“At this moment, Xiaotian seemed to suddenly remember something and continued, “Sister Yao, do you know that boss has been looking for someone? I think it might have something to do with this person.” ”

“Who?”Chen Siyao asked.

“”It seems to be a little girl. How should I put it? She’s not a little girl anymore. I heard that it has something to do with Boss’s childhood.”Xiaotian continued, “Because of this matter, Boss had previously investigated the Mu family’s daughter, Mu Yourong.” ”

Xiaotian didn’t know much about this matter.

He only knew about this matter.

“Chen Siyao also seemed to suddenly remember something and continued, “Then what happened after that?” ”

“Little Tian thought for a moment. “After that, the daughter of the Mu family was imprisoned for murder, and then she escaped from prison. In the end, I heard that she died on her way out.” ”

Chen Siyao nodded lightly.

Was It This Mu Yourong? 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Chen Siyao stood up and looked at Little Tian. “Little Tian, thank you for telling me this.” ”

“”Sister Yao, you’re too polite.”Little Tian stood up as well. ”

“Chen Siyao smiled. “I’ve already bought the order. I still have something to do, so I’ll be leaving first.” ”

“After taking a few steps, Chen Siyao seemed to have thought of something. She continued, “I ordered some desserts for the waiter to take away. You can bring them back and give them to your family to try.” ”

“”Thank you, sister Yao,”Xiao Tian immediately thanked her. ”

“The coffee shop that Chen Siyao chose was a high-end coffee shop. For ordinary people, it was an existence that was out of reach. ”

That was why they could only take a look at it.

It was very thoughtful of Chen Siyao to ask him to take the desserts home.

“You’re welcome.”Chen siyao walked out.

“Just as Chen Siyao left, the waiter brought the desserts over. ”

“Xiao Tian took the desserts and said politely, “Thank you.” ”

Old Master Chen also came to Nanhai to relax.

Chen Siyao immediately went to the hotel where Old Master Chen stayed and asked about the situation back then.

“”Grandpa, was Shiyu saved by a little girl back then? What exactly happened back then? Can you tell me?”Chen Siyao looked at Old Master Chen and asked. ”

Old Master Chen was old and couldn’t stand alone. He was sitting in a wheelchair.

“”Yaoyao, do you still have fantasies about Shiyu?”Old Master Chen looked at his only granddaughter with a complicated look in his eyes. ”

“As an elder, he also liked song Shiyu very much and hoped that Chen Siyao could get together with song Shiyu. ”

“Because he had watched song Shiyu grow up, he knew that song Shiyu was a person who was worthy of being entrusted with his life. ”

“Unfortunately, falling flowers intentionally flowed without mercy. ”

There were some things that couldn’t be forced.

Especially when it came to relationships.

“Chen Siyao continued, “You know that I love Shiyu very much. I love him very much.” ”

Old Master Chen sighed. “But he’s not suitable for you.”

“Chen Siyao’s gaze dimmed for a moment before she continued, “Grandfather, all you have to do now is tell me about what happened back then.” ”

“Old Master Chen’s memories instantly returned to the past as he slowly said, “Back then, Shiyu was kidnapped. Coincidentally, there was a little girl who was locked up with Shiyu that day. Later on, I found out that the little girl was the daughter of the Mu family.” ”

“After he said that, old master Chen continued, “I heard that this girl gave Shiyu a lot of warmth. If it wasn’t for him, Shiyu might not have been able to hold on.” ”

Chen Siyao listened carefully.

“According to what Old Master Chen said, the person in song Shiyu’s heart was most likely the deceased daughter of the Mu family. ”

No wonder he couldn’t love her.

“In that instant, Chen Siyao saw hope. ”

“Mu Yourong was already dead. Even if song Shiyu liked her, he could only keep her in his heart. ”

“Chen Siyao squatted in front of old master Chen. “Grandfather, I want to ask you for something.” ”

Old Master Chen was stunned.

“Chen Siyao was his only granddaughter, and she had never spoken to him in such a tone before. ”

“What is it?”Old Master Chen asked.

“Chen siyao continued, “Grandpa, I remember that you were kind to me when I met you.” ”

“What do you want?”Old Master Chen asked.

“Chen Siyao held old master Chen’s hands tightly, “Grandpa, do you know how much I love when I met you? I just want to marry him for the rest of my life! If I can’t marry him, I’d rather die alone! “You owe him a favor. If you speak to him personally, he definitely won’t reject you.” ”
