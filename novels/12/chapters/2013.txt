“”Then...”Li Zi Yue looked at ye Zhuo and continued, “Then Miss Ye will definitely come back, right?” ”

Ye Zhuo nodded. “Yes.”

“She will. She will definitely come back.”

“Really?”Li Zi Yue’s eyes were filled with hope once again.

Ye Zhuo nodded again.

“Then is there anything that we can help with?”Li Zi Yue asked.

Ye Zhuo looked at Li Zi Yue as if he suddenly remembered something. “There is indeed something.”

“”Sister Qiao, go ahead,”said Li Zi Yue. ”

Ye Zhuo whispered something into his ear.

“Hearing this, Li Zi Yue nodded. “Sister Qiao, don’t worry. I will definitely do a good job for you.” ”

“”Okay.”Ye Zhuo continued, “I have other matters to attend to. I’ll be leaving first.” ”

“Li Ziyue immediately made way. “Take care, sister Qiao.” ”

Ye Zao walked forward.

“Only when ye Zao’s figure disappeared in front of him did Li Ziyue remember something. He patted his forehead and said, “I forgot to leave her contact information!” ”

“Old Dai smiled and said, “Since Miss Qiao can follow Miss Ye, it means that she’s not an ordinary person. As long as she wants to, she’ll definitely have a way to contact you.” ”

Li Zi Yue nodded. “That’s true.”

“After all, looking at Qiao Yi’s skills, he knew that she was not a simple person. ”

Ye Zao walked all the way to the worn-out aircraft before stopping.

Yi Ling flew out from the backpack behind her. “Great Zao Zao.”

“En.”Ye Zao opened the door of the aircraft with one hand.

“”Ye Lan is really too inhuman!”Yi Ling said very angrily. “Back then, you were so good to her and helped her shoulder everything. But what about her! ?”! She judged a gentleman’s heart with a villain’s heart. She felt that you didn’t let her find her biological parents because you were jealous! What on Earth is she thinking! ! Has she grown a brain?” ”

Did Ye Zao need to be jealous of her?

“If one thought about it with their toes, they should know that there was definitely an inside story behind this. ”

But ye LAN seemed to have no brain.

“Yi Ling continued to say, “Da Zao Zao, why didn’t you let me say everything just now! ?”! ”

“If ye Zao had not stopped it, it would have rushed out and said everything! ”

“”There are some words that have no meaning anymore,”ye Zao said faintly. ”

Her sisterly relationship with Ye Lan had come to an end.

Ye Zao could tolerate anything except betrayal.

Yi Ling looked at ye Zao and did not know how to speak. Her eyes were slightly red. She flapped her wings and flew up to hug ye Zao. “Great burning.”

“Ye Zao reached out and patted its back. His eyes were curved. “Doggie, I’m fine.” ”

Yi Ling understood ye Zao too well.

“She looked strong and did not care about anything. In fact, she was weak in her heart. ”

She wished more than anyone that she could have a home and someone to lean on.

“No matter how strong a person was, they all had weaknesses. ”

Family ties were probably ye Zao’s biggest weakness.

“Because ye Zao had experienced it all the way, she knew how difficult it was to be an orphan. ”

But now.

“Her younger sister, who had been raised by him, had betrayed her, and her younger brother, who was even closer to her than her own brother, had also betrayed her. ”

Yi Ling only felt her heart ache.

“She yearned for family ties so much, but family ties had betrayed her time and time again. ”

How terrible must she feel now!

“As she thought about it, Yi Ling actually cried out loud. ”

“”Don’t Cry Anymore,”ye Zhuo continued, “I’m really fine. There’s something I forgot to tell you. On Earth, I found my own family. They treat me very well...” ” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Perhaps, this was the so-called loss and gain. ”

“What didn’t exist in changyue, on Earth, she had it all. ”

“Family, friendship, love... ”

“Hearing this, Yi Ling stopped crying and looked up at Ye Zhuo. “Really?” ”

“Of course it’s true.”Ye Zhuo rubbed Yi Ling’s little head. “So I have to quickly settle things here. They’re still waiting for me there.”

“Are you going back?”Yi Ling asked.

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Then will you come back?”

Ye Zao hesitated for a moment.

She really had not thought about this.

“Seeing that she did not speak, Yi Ling continued, “Then can I go back with you?” ”

It wanted to see ye Zao’s family.

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“Oh Yeah! That’s Great!”Yi Ling hugged ye Zao excitedly and kissed her.

“At this moment, ye Zao’s communicator lit up. ”

Ye Zao picked up the communicator and narrowed her beautiful eyes.

“”Da Zao Zao, What’s Wrong?”Noticing that her expression was not right, Yi Ling asked. ”
