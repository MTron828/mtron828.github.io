“The two of them walked into the house together. Cen Shaoqing directly pushed ye Zhuo behind the door and trapped her between the door and him. “Leader, when can I end my internship?” ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “Look at me...” ”

“The remaining two words, ‘mood’, were stuffed in Cen Shaoqing’s mouth and swallowed in his stomach. ”

“The kiss lasted for about five minutes. Cen Shaoqing only let go of her when he could no longer hold it in. He turned around and said, “I’ll make the bed.” ”

Ye Zhuo looked at his back and teased him on purpose. “Why do you want to make the bed? Why Don’t you sleep in the same room as me tonight?”

Cen Shaoqing stopped in his tracks and quickly walked to the second bedroom.

“This second bedroom was where ye Sen had stayed before. Cen Shaoqing had stayed here once before, so he was quite familiar with this place. ”

“Ye Zhuo stood outside the door. “Mr. Cen, are you sure you don’t want to consider it?” ”

“Cen Shaoqing took a deep breath, his eyes darkening. ”

“However, Ye Zhuo continued to tease him outside. “Mr. Cen, there won’t be such a shop after this village.” ”

Ye Zhuo understood Cen Shaoqing very well.

He was a rare gentleman.

“Although they would usually kiss and hug each other, CEN Shaoqing never did anything out of line with her. ”

“Even if he couldn’t help it anymore, he still maintained his gentlemanly demeanor. ”

Like now.

It was precisely because he knew Cen Shaoqing’s personality that ye Zhuo dared to tease him like this.

“Right at this moment, the door that was originally closed suddenly opened. ”

Ye Zhuo raised his brows slightly. “Have you thought it through?”

Cen Shaoqing looked at Ye Zhuo like this. “A gentleman hides his weapon in his body and waits for the right moment to make a move. I’ll remember this debt today.”

“After saying that, Cen Shaoqing slammed the door again. ”

Ye Zhuo was stunned.

A gentleman hides his weapon in his body and waits for the right moment to make a move?

Did this sentence mean what she had understood at the beginning?

“When ye Zhuo completely understood this sentence, it was after the wedding night. ”

“From then on, she could no longer look directly at this sentence. ”

Of course.

This was also a matter for the future.

...

The next morning.

“Ye Zao woke up early to prepare breakfast. When he woke up, he found that Cen Shaoqing was already busy in the kitchen. ”

“The man was wearing a plain long gown. He was clearly dressed in a very retro style, but there was a hint of unruly arrogance on his body. He placed the Buddha beads on the stove at the side. ”

“Ye Zao leaned against the door frame of the kitchen and smiled. “Mr. Cen, you’re really becoming more virtuous.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing looked back slightly and said in a low voice, “So Miss Ye, from now on, you just have to be responsible for being as beautiful as a flower. Leave the rest to me.” ”

“After saying that, Cen Shaoqing turned around and asked, “What do you want to eat in the morning?” ”

“Ye Zhuo asked, “What did you make?” ”

“CEN Shaoqing said, “I made porridge, and then I saw some buns in the refrigerator. I steamed two buns, and then I boiled milk.”There weren’t many people living here, and Ye Zhuo had bought the buns from the supermarket. ” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Then let’s eat what you made.”Ye Zao walked over and helped him bring the porridge and the buns to the dining table.

Breakfast was very simple.

“After bringing everything to the table, ye Zao seemed to remember something, and then he said, “Oh, right, there’s still some pickled vegetables. I can have porridge, I’ll go get them.” ”

“Where is it? I’ll go.”Cen Shaoqing stood up.

“”It’s on the second floor of the hanging cabinet,”ye Zao said. ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly and walked into the kitchen.

“Ye Zao had soaked the pickles with the leftover white radishes the night before last. They were sour, spicy, delicious, crisp, and very appetizing. They were just right for the porridge. ”

The two of them sat opposite each other and ate breakfast slowly. It was a beautiful and quiet morning.

Cen Shaoqing slightly raised his eyes to look at her. The corners of his mouth curled up slightly. His deep eyes seemed to be filled with the whole world.

“At the same time, in Beijing. ”

At the hospital.

“Gu Dexin lay on the bed and looked at Gu Dening, who was arranging flowers by the window. “Dening, why don’t you go and meet someone later?” ”

“I don’t want to go.”Gu Dening’s face was full of unwillingness.

“”Why not?”GU dexin continued, “How Old Are You? Don’t you know? Ye Sen is the same. He clearly has a crush on you, yet he kept it to himself! You are the same. If he doesn’t want to say it, then just say it! He’s already 28 years old. Why Are You So Shy?” ”

“Who said I like him?”Gu dening retorted.

“”If you don’t like him, then go on the blind date obediently!”Gu Dexin said. ”

“Actually, Gu Dexin had her own reasons for letting gu dening go on the blind date. ”

“Firstly, Gu dening was indeed old enough. ”

“Secondly, she wanted to give ye Sen a sense of crisis. ”

“She didn’t know what was going on with ye Sen. He was obviously interested in gu dening, but he didn’t say anything. ”
