Chapter 76: 072: Face slapping! In the Burning Business Empire, Lin Shasha recognized the scumbag and had an abortion

No, no, no!

Cen Shaoqing quickly dismissed this unrealistic idea. Only the vegetarian mu yourong was the most suitable for CEN Shaoqing. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Lin Shasha took a walk outside.

When she returned home, she calmly told her parents about her pregnancy and her desire to have an abortion.

The Lin family’s parents were conservative people. When they heard that their daughter was pregnant, they thought that they should forget about the dowry.

Seeing that her parents were thinking this way, Lin Sha turned on her phone and showed the video that ye Zao had sent her to her parents.

After the video was sent, even someone as good-tempered as Lin Jinshui could not help but slam the table and stand up!

The Zhang family was too much of a bully!

Zhou Yuelian hugged Lin Shasha with a heartache. “Shasha, don’t be afraid. I’ll go to the hospital with you tomorrow.”

“Thank you, Mom.”Lin Shasha thought that Zhou Yuelian would scold her and blame her for not recognizing people clearly.

Unexpectedly, Zhou Yuelian and Lin Jinshui did not blame her at all.

“Silly child, you must not be so careless when you find a boyfriend in the future,”Zhou Yuelian continued, “This time, it’s all thanks to searing. If it weren’t for her, you would still be suffering in the future if you really got married!”

How many mothers in this world would sacrifice their entire lives just for the sake of their children and not get a divorce.

Zhou Yuelian was really scared now.

Fortunately!

Fortunately, they met ye searing.

The next day, Zhou Yuelian brought Lin Shasha to the hospital.

The moment they came out of the operating room.

Lin Shasha felt as if she had been reborn.

From now on, she would only be herself!

She would not rely on anyone.

And she would not leave the rest of her life to a man!

These days, Zhao Pingting had been insisting on taking ye Zao’s prescription and running with him.

The effect was very obvious. In just half a month, Zhao Pingting had lost more than ten pounds.

When an Lizi heard that the two of them ran together every morning, she also joined them and ran with them.

The two-person line became a three-person line.

Class 7.

“Hey, did you guys notice that Zhao Pingting seems to have lost some weight recently?”

“Yes, yes, yes! I noticed it too!”

A short-haired girl said in a strange tone, “Did you guys see wrongly? I think Zhu Bajie is still as fat as before! An ugly monster. Even if she loses weight, she’s still an ugly monster!”

“Shh! God Ye Is Here!”

The students who were originally gathered together and chattering immediately shut up.

“F * ck! God Ye walks with the wind!”

“God ye is so cool!”

Ye Zhuo lazily threw his bag on the desk. Then, he walked to a seat and stopped. He just looked at the short-haired girl.

Her gaze was very indifferent, but she inexplicably looked at the short-haired girl and shivered.

“Ye, God Ye, What’s Wrong?”

Ye Zao casually picked up the ballpoint pen on the table and casually folded it.

“Kacha –”

The hard ballpoint pen broke just like that.

The short-haired girl nervously swallowed her throat.

Everyone knew that ye Zao was very protective of his shortcomings.

Without even thinking, it was obvious who ye Zao was here for.

Ye Zao slightly bent over and tapped on the table with his fingers. He lowered his voice and said, “Pig Ba Jie? Ugly Freak? Who gave you the courage to talk about my deskmate behind my back? HMM?”

The short-haired girl’s face turned pale. “I’m... I’m sorry, God Ye...”

At this moment, Zhao Pingting walked in from outside the classroom. “Zao Zao, what are you doing?”

Ye Zao put his arm around the short-haired girl’s neck and smiled. “I’m telling a joke to Gu Ziyao! Gu Ziyao, is the joke I just told you funny?”

Gu Ziyao nodded. “Yes, it’s funny.”

“Um...”Zhao Pingting walked over. “Zhuo Zhuo, her name is Li Ziyao.”

Ye Zhuo:”...”

On the other side.

Lin Sha hadn’t contacted Zhang Qiang for a few days, which made him a little flustered.

Zhang Qiang immediately called Lin Sha.

However, it was a cold electronic voice on the other end of the phone. “Hello, the number you have dialed is switched off.”

Then, Zhang Qiang logged into wechat again and realized that Lin Sha had blocked him.

Zhang Qiang realized that something was wrong and quickly went home to find mother Zhang.

Mother Zhang did not take this matter to heart at all, she smiled and said, “She just wants to scare you on purpose. Don’t worry, she won’t dare to do anything to you! Just leave her alone for a while. In less than ten days, she will take the initiative to add you back on wechat!”

“Really?”Zhang Qiang looked at mother Zhang in disbelief.

“Of course it’s true,”mother zhang said, “I’ve seen all kinds of people in your mother’s life? “But when the time comes, if she adds you on wechat, you must not forgive her so easily. At least show her some colors! “Let her know what the rules of our Zhang family are!”
