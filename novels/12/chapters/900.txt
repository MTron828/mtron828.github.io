“Just as song Chenyu was feeling depressed, director Feng raised his head in surprise. “Ye, you and CEO song, Do you know each other?””

Ye Zhuo smiled slightly. “We’re friends.”

Song Shiyu nodded slightly. “Yes.”

“When he heard that song Shiyu and Ye Zhuo knew each other, director Feng heaved a sigh of relief.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

It was good that they were friends.

“If they did not know each other, director Feng really did not know how to end things.”

“After all, Song Shiyu’s reputation was well known.”

Friend?

Ye Zhuo’s face was really big. He actually said that she and song Shiyu were friends.

“If it were not for Cen Shaoqing’s words, song Shiyu probably would not have even looked at her twice.”

He did not know how she had the nerve to say such a thing!

“Song Chenyu opened his mouth at the right time. “Third brother, when did you and Yezi Meet?””

“”Not long ago,”song Shiyu said concisely.”

“OH.”Song Chenyu nodded.

“Looking at song Shiyu’s indifferent expression, he probably didn’t take ye Zhuo to heart.”

She knew that song Shiyu had given Cen Shaoqing face and barely responded to Ye Zhuo.

“In front of Song Shiyu, Ye Zao was nothing?”

He was not even a small sparrow.

“Ye Zao looked at the two of them in surprise. “Brother Song, are you brother and sister?””

“Yes.”Song Shiyu nodded slightly. “Chenyu is my sister.”

Ye Zao did not expect that song Chenyu and song Shiyu were actually brother and sister.

“When Old Madam Song passed away last year, Song Chenyu was not present. Ye Zao thought that song Shiyu was the only son.”

“OH.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Song Shiyu raised his head to look at song Shiyu and continued, “Third brother, it’s not easy for you to come here. I’ll bring you to see where I live.””

Ye Zhuo was too beautiful.

“Although song Shiyu did not have any thoughts towards ye Zhuo right now, just in case, song Shiyu still did not want ye Zhuo to have too much contact with song Shiyu.”

“Alright.”Song Shiyu nodded slightly and followed song Chenyu’s footsteps.

“Yin Wei stood beside ye Zao, she said softly, “Yezi, I was scared to death just now! That was the head of the song family! “It’s a good thing that you know the head of the song family. But speaking of which, I really did not expect song Chenyu and the head of the song family to be brother and sister! “The two of them don’t look alike at all!””

“Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly. “Actually, I didn’t expect that they were brother and sister.””

“Yin Wei continued, “I heard that song Shiyu killed someone.”After all, a person whose hands were stained with blood was different from an ordinary person. There was a sense of ruthlessness that ordinary people could not resist.”

“I’m not too sure.”Ye Zhuo’s expression was indifferent.

“Seeing that ye Zhuo did not seem to be interested in this matter, Yin Wei did not continue speaking. She followed ye Zhuo into the house.”

“Ye Zao found the medical kit that he carried with him. He took out a bottle of ointment and handed it to Yin Wei. “Wei Wei, go and give this to Song Shiyu. I’ll go to the kitchen to take a look.””

“Due to Guan Li, song Shiyu’s face was not only bruised but also swollen. If he did not apply some ointment, it would probably take about a week for the bruise to disperse.”

Yin Wei hurriedly waved her hand. “I’m afraid. I’m not going.”

“Although song Shiyu did not do anything, Yin Wei was still afraid. She did not even dare to look up at him. Just one more look and her scalp would go numb.”

That kind of fear was emitted from deep within her bones.

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “Look at how useless you are! No matter how terrifying song Shiyu is, he’s just a human. He can’t eat you up.””

“”I’m not going anyway,”yin wei continued, “There’s no use trying to provoke him.””

“Ye Zao continued, “Then go to the pot and watch the fire. I’ve just boiled the chestnuts and they’re almost cooked now. If the water in the pot has been boiled dry, add more water. Don’t let it Burn.””

“”Okay, I’ll go now.”Yin Wei quickly ran toward the kitchen.”

Ye Zhuo took the ointment and went to where song Chenyu was resting.

“Standing outside, he could vaguely hear song Chenyu’s voice coming from inside.”

“”Third brother, why didn’t you inform me beforehand that you were coming to see me? I could have arranged for my assistant to pick you up at the airport in advance.””

Song Shiyu’s tone was indifferent. “There’s no need to go through so much trouble.”

Ye Zhuo did not have the habit of listening to the corner of the wall. He reached out and knocked on the door.

“Who is it?”Song Chenyu asked.

“It’s me.”

It was ye Zhuo again.

Song Chenyu’s eyes were filled with disdain.

What was Ye Zhuo doing here?

Wasn’t he just trying to seduce song Shiyu.

It was really too disgusting!

“Standing behind the door, song Chenyu adjusted his expression and smiled. “Yezi, why are you here?””

Ye Zhuo took out the ointment. “This is the ointment for promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis. Please pass it to Brother Song.”
