“Lin Ze said politely, “Grandma Cen, you’re too polite. Fifth Master Cen is busy with his official business, so we shouldn’t disturb him.” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen smiled and said, “Ah Ze, you’re of the same generation as our Shaoqing. It’s strange to call him fifth master, just call him fifth brother.” ”

“”Fifth brother,”Lin ze greeted politely. ”

“At this moment, Lin Ze never expected that CEN Shaoqing would become his brother-in-law in the near future. ”

“Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “Ah Ze, do you have any misunderstanding about me?” ”

“”No,”Lin ze replied. ”

He knew Cen Shaoqing too well. Why would he need to have a misunderstanding?

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “It’s good that there’s no misunderstanding. Then we’ll go back first. Ah Ze, Yezi, you must come to my place to play when you have time!” ”

Lin Ze and ye Zhuo sent the two of them out of the hotel.

“Lin Jincheng and ye Shu were standing outside the door to send the guests off. When they saw Cen Shaoqing and old Mrs. Cen coming out, the two of them immediately came over to welcome them. ”

They got into the car.

“Old Mrs. Cen looked at Cen Shaoqing and said very seriously, “Rascal, you’re in trouble!” ”

“Huh?”Cen Shaoqing looked back slightly.

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “What’s the use of staring at me with your beautiful Big Eyes Now? Do you know that you’ve offended your brother-in-law terribly?” ”

“Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads, his expression unmoving. ” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Old Mrs. Cen said again, “Looking at Ah Ze’s appearance, it’s almost impossible for him to forgive you in a short period of time! “So, you should take it slow and use your actions to influence him! “Don’t always act tough and smile more. Look at you, you look like someone who owes you millions. It would be strange if Ah Ze would accept you as his brother-in-law!” ”

“”You sand sculpture, did you hear what I Said?”Old Mrs. Cen poked at Cen Shaoqing’s arm. ”

Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips parted. “I heard it.”

“Old Mrs. Cen then instructed, “And your father-in-law, you have to please him as well! I think your father-in-law won’t have it easy either! Remember to read those books that I gave you last time! Read them carefully! Learn the tricks of a straight-a student chasing his wife! Haven’t you heard of a saying? Since ancient times, deep feelings can not be kept. Only tricks can win the hearts of people! You say that you have deep feelings and tricks. Can a petite wife escape?” ”

“At this point, Granny Cen seemed to have thought of something and sighed, “Why do you think that Yezi is Zhao Fangyue’s granddaughter? !”! “Now that I think of Zhao Fangyue’s ugly face, I get angry!”! “Yezi is so beautiful, so outstanding, and so amazing. What right does she, Zhao fangyue, have to be Yezi’s grandmother?”? “Fortunately, Yezi looks like Jin Cheng and Ah Shu. If she looks like Zhao fangyue, then it would be the scene of a disaster movie!” ”

Old Mrs. Lin was ye Zhuo’s grandmother. It was simply difficult for old Mrs. Cen to calm down.

Not long after.

The car stopped at the entrance of the Cen family manor.

Old Mrs. Cen got off the car with a crutch.

“”Grandma, you’re back.”Cen Yueya hurriedly came up to greet her. “Have you seen your sister-in-law?” ”

Old Mrs. Cen nodded and handed the crutch to Cen Yueya. “Of course I’ve seen her!”

“Cen Yueya took the walking stick and could not help but complain, “Grandma, you don’t need a walking stick at all. Why do you always bring a walking stick when you go out? Is it not a problem?” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen was more than eighty years old this year. She was not deaf, not blind, her footsteps were steady, and her body was excellent. It was delicious to Eat! ”

She did not need a walking stick at all.

“”What do you know! This is called imposing!”Old Mrs. Cen raised her head and said arrogantly, “Didn’t you see the old matriarch on TV holding a walking stick with a dragon head?”The way she looked could not be more imposing! ”

“Of course, the most important thing was that it was convenient to hit people! ”

“If anyone dared to provoke her, she would swing the walking stick and hit them. ”

“Cen Yueya’s face was full of smiles. This grandmother of hers was simply an old mischievous child, like a child. ”

...

The Lin family.

“As soon as they returned to the Lin family manor, Old Mrs. Lin called Lin Jincheng to the side hall. ”

“When are you going to change that girl’s surname?”

“Lin Jincheng frowned slightly. “Mother, what do you mean?” ”

“Old Lady Lin glared at Lin Jincheng. “What I mean is for you to change her surname! Since she is of the Lin family’s bloodline, what’s the point of always following an outsider’s surname?” ”

“”I can’t do that.”Lin Jincheng continued, “Zhuoluo was brought up by Ah Shu, so she should follow Ah Shu’s surname. Also, Ah Shu isn’t an outsider. She is my wife, Zhuoluo and Ah Ze’s mother.” ”

“In the past nineteen years, he had never fulfilled his father’s duty, and now he was asking him to change ye Zhuozhuo’s surname? ”
