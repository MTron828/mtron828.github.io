“Who knew that once it was removed, Cen Haifeng would immediately remember many things. ”

“Helpless, Duanmu Phoenix Fei could only use those fragmented memories to deceive Cen Haifeng. Who knew that Cen Haifeng would actually insist on going to Earth to bring those people back. ”

This was something that Duanmu Phoenix Fei had never expected.

“En.”Duanmu Phoenix Fei nodded.

“She was glad that she still had a family that she could rely on. Otherwise, she really did not know who to look for after such a huge incident. ”

“Mrs. Duanmu continued to comfort her, “Sister, don’t be too anxious now. I believe that the Imperial preceptor and the great elder will definitely have a solution.” ”

“If she said that she was not anxious at all, it would definitely be a lie. ”

“Since things had come to this point, Duanmu Fenghuang Fei could not fall asleep for the entire night. ”

“After a while, Duanmu Fengfei grabbed Duanmu Fengyu’s hand tightly and said, “Fengyu, you must think of a way to have a child of your own in the future. Even if it’s a girl, it’s better than nothing.” ”

Duanmu Fengfei was very regretful that he did not have a child.

“If he had a child as a link, Cen Haifeng would not be so heartless. He would not stay away for more than half a month ”

“Duanmu Huangfei’s words were from the bottom of his heart. He continued, “Don’t worry. When the time comes, I will help you too.” ”

“Duanmu fengyu nodded. “Thank you, aunt.” ”

“”Fengyu, I don’t have a child of my own. You are just like my biological daughter.”At the same time, Duanmu Huangfei did not want to watch Duanmu fengyu repeat her old path. ”

“Back then, it was because she didn’t listen to Duanmu Tianxiang that she was reduced to this state. ” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

What Love.

It was all BULLSH * T!

“Thinking of this, Duanmu huangfei tightly gripped the armrest of the chair. Because she used too much strength, her knuckles had already turned slightly white. ”

...

Lin family.

“After eating, Ye Zhuo sat in the courtyard and chatted with Ye Shu. ”

“The mother and daughter lay on the rocking chair and looked at the stars in the sky. The summer wind was gentle, and it was really pleasant. ”

“”Zha Zha, is Xiao Han home now?” ”

“Not yet.”Ye Zha looked at the starry sky. “I think he will have to wait for another day or so.”

“Ye Shu nodded and continued, “Oh Right, Zha Zha, your aunt Xiang’s birthday is in a few days. What do you plan to give her?” ”

“Which day is Aunt Xiang’s Birthday?”Ye Zha was stunned.

“If ye Shu did not mention it, she really would not know when Zhou Xiang’s birthday was. ”

“Ye Shu continued, “The 18th of July in the solar calendar is her birthday.”Ye Shu was a thoughtful person. She wrote down all the birthdays of her relatives in her notebook. If she did not have the time to personally come and wish them well.., she would prepare some exquisite gifts for people to send over. ”

“Therefore, Ye Shu’s popularity was very good. ”

She was good at handling interpersonal relationships.

“Ye Zhuo counted with his fingers and then said, “That’s still a week away.” ”

“Yes.”Ye Shu nodded. “You and Shaoqing are boyfriend and girlfriend. This gift can’t be too light or too heavy. You must consider it carefully.”

The Cen family and the Lin family were not ordinary families. Many people were watching the gift-giving.

It had to be appropriate and thoughtful.

“”Don’t worry, Mom. I know,”ye Zao said. ”

“Ye Shu said, “When Little Han left last time, did you tell him to come home more often?” ”

“Ye Zao smiled at Ye Shu and continued, “Mom, I’m not the only one who said that. Just you and dad held his hand and said it more than eight hundred times in front of him.” ”

“Ye Shu said, “I don’t know why, but I really like that Kid Little Han. I still feel empty in my heart when he suddenly left.” ”

“Ye Zao had a smile on his face. If ye Han heard this, he would definitely be very happy. ”

Ye Han was the same as her.

He had longed for a family since he was young.

“Unfortunately, this ordinary wish had never been realized. ”

“”Ye Han also likes our family very much,”ye Zao said. ”

“Ye Shu sighed. “Unfortunately, Xiao Han still has more important things to do. Otherwise, I really want him to stay. In the future, I’ll let him take over my noodle shop and your father’s business.” ”

Other families were all siblings fighting over family assets.

“When they arrived at the Lin family, the siblings were not interested in accepting the family business. ”

It was not easy for ye Han to come. He had to leave after only staying at home for a few days.

“”Don’t worry, he’ll come to see you often in the future,”ye Zhuo said. ”

“Ye Shu seemed to have thought of something and continued, “Oh right, Zhuo Zhuo, did anything special happen at Shaoqing’s house recently?” ”

“”No, why would you suddenly ask?”Ye burning asked. ”
