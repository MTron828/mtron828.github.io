“Chapter 1570: 238: After learning the truth, the entire Internet was furious. What happened to Zhang Qingqing! 3”

An Lizi did not understand computers. She only saw lines of code that kept changing on the computer screen.

She was dazzled.

“The next second, the screen full of code turned into a surveillance screen. ”

Ye Zao clicked save.

“An Lizi said in surprise, “Isn’t this Chao Feng Club?” ”

“That’s right.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“An lizi continued, “Is this the surveillance camera in Ah Ze’s room?” ”

“Yes.”

“But isn’t there no surveillance camera in Chao Feng Club?”An Lizi was a little puzzled.

“”This is a pinhole camera placed by other guests,”ye Zhuo continued, “So, when we stay in the hotel, we must check it carefully!” ”

“Oh my God!”An Lizi’s scalp was numb. “I thought this kind of thing only happened in the news! I didn’t expect it to happen in real life!”

On the other side.

“Er Mao looked at the changes on the computer screen, looked at his watch, and said incredulously, “Ten minutes! Big Boss only used ten minutes!” ”

“Eighty hair said, “Big Boss’s speed is too fast. I didn’t even see it clearly!” ”

“He, a professional computer expert, didn’t even see it clearly, let alone an ordinary person! ”

“”If Big Boss isn’t fast, then can he still be called Big Boss?”Er Mao looked at eighty hair. ”

Ba Mao nodded. “That’s true!”

“After all, he was a big shot. ”

There was a reason why he could become a big shot.

“Just as the internet was seeking justice for Little Zhang and praising Father Zhang and mother Zhang for being good people, the official Weibo of the LIN Group posted a Weibo. ”

“Official Weibo of the Lin Group: [ justice may be late, but he will never be absent. ”

“Our department has already sent a lawyer’s letter to Ms. Zhang Qingqing, Mr. Zhang Dadong, and Ms. Liu Yueqin,@wenmanhe lawyer. ] ”

“Below the text, there was a surveillance video. ”

“When they first saw this weibo, they were furious. ”

Send a lawyer’s letter?

What’s wrong with this world!

A rapist actually sent a lawyer’s letter to the victim!

“But when everyone clicked on the video, they were stunned. ”

It was another twist.

“At the beginning of the video, there was a young man lying on the bed. ”

“In a flash, the door opened. ”

“A woman crept in from outside the door. Although she was far away, she could still tell that the woman was Zhang Qingqing. ”

“After Zhang Qingqing came in, she first looked at the young man lying on the bed, then lifted the quilt and lay on it for a while. Then, she took out a dagger and directly cut her wrist. ”

“The blood dripped on the bedsheet, and instantly, a flower bloomed. ”

“After doing all this, Zhang Qingqing took out a small bottle of spray and sprayed it into the air twice... ”

“The video was not long, but everyone was filled with anger. ”

Who would have thought that this was all a play that Zhang Qingqing had staged herself!

“[ so it was her who cut her wrist! I told you, how could a person who had been kept by an old man have a first time! ] ”

[ see you when you live. ]

“[ I thought that Lin Ze must have had sex with her, so nothing that should have happened happened happened! Everything was just a self-directed act by this woman. ] ”

“[ how could such a woman still have the face to live in this world? If I were her, I would just bang my head against the Wall and die. ] ”

“[ Lin Ze is really unlucky. He just slept for a while. After he woke up, he inexplicably became the baby’s father. ] ”

[ I really feel sorry for Lin Ze. ]

[ this woman is really shameless! ]

[ F * ck! It’s really disgusting. ]

“[ fortunately, there’s a video. Otherwise, young master Lin wouldn’t be able to clear his name even if he jumped into the Yellow River. This kind of person isn’t worthy of sympathy at all. It’s best if he is locked up and not released for the rest of his life! Otherwise, he will cause harm to others! ] ”

[ you’re right! This kind of vicious woman with a venomous heart should be locked up for the rest of her life! ] Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

[ I’m so angry watching her through a screen! ]

[ I’m really embarrassed for her parents. ]

[ didn’t the person upstairs watch her parents’Video? How should I put it? The environment is what it is. It’s precisely because her parents don’t have a good outlook on life that her daughter doesn’t have a good outlook on life! ]

“[ damn it, I’m dying of laughter! I’ll just ask those who said that the Zhang family’s parents have a good outlook on life. Does their face hurt? ] ”

“[ yes, it hurts a lot. ] ”

“[ stop talking, I want my face. ] ”

“[ here, I want to apologize to the LIN Corporation, Beijing University, and finally, Yezi. ] ”

“[ I’m sorry, I’m sorry, we shouldn’t force ourselves to follow the trend! ] ”

“Zhang Qingqing thought that when she opened her phone again, it would be a bunch of private messages to comfort her and make her stronger. ”

“She did not expect that after opening the private messages, they would all curse her to die! ”
