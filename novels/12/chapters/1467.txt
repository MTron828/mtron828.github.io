It was really too strange.

“This person spent two hours but was unable to break through the firewall. However, after changing his ID, he managed to break through within a short ten minutes. ”

Could it be that the other party had changed people?

“But even if they had changed people, they should not have been able to break through his firewall within a short ten minutes. ”

L narrowed his eyes.

At the same time.

Selead branch.

In the head office.

“When Smith found out that ye Zao had recovered the surveillance footage that L had hacked, he said in disbelief, “Really?” ”

The deputy executive nodded. “It’s the real Miss Smith! I’ve already handed the recovered surveillance footage to the technical department to investigate. I believe we’ll be able to find Carl very soon!” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Smith walked to Ye Zhuo’s side. “This is Miss Ye?”

“Ye Zhuo took the initiative to reach out his hand to Smith. “Miss Smith, nice to meet you. I’m Ye Zhuo.” ”

“”Miss Ye is really amazing,”Miss Smith said with a smile. “It’s just like what you Chinese say! Young and promising!” ”

“”You’re too kind,”ye zhuo continued, “Regarding Carl’s matter, I...” ”

“Before ye Zao could finish his sentence, the office door was suddenly pushed open forcefully. ”

Adar walked in with Polly.

“”Mr. Adar, what happened?”Smith looked up at Adar. ”

“Adar said angrily, “Miss Smith! That’s not what happened! It was Miss Ye who stole Polly’s results. The surveillance was restored by Polly. It has nothing to do with Miss Ye!” ”

“Smith looked at Yardar with a face full of question marks. “Mr. Yardar, what do you mean?” ”

“Yardar continued, “Because Miss ye used Polly’s computer just now. After Miss Ye sat on it, the progress bar reached 100% . Therefore, the surveillance footage was recovered by Polly. Miss ye only benefited from Polly!”Yardar could not bear this injustice. ”

“The person who restored the surveillance footage was clearly Polly, so why should ye Zao take the credit? ”

“If he did not say a word, ye Zao would really think that F Nation people were easy to bully! ”

A puny Chinese wanted to bully them?

No Way!

Ye Zao chuckled. “Can’t afford to lose?”

“”Is it that we can’t afford to lose, or did you use underhanded methods!”Yardar looked at ye Zao, then he said, “Do you really think you can recover the surveillance footage that L hacked? In your dreams! WHO IS L? The number one hacker in the world! Miss Smith, please give Boris Justice!” ”

Smith was a little troubled.

“Ye Zao was the one who recovered the surveillance footage, but ye Zao was using Boris’computer. ”

“After all, Boris had already been working hard on the computer for two hours. ”

“Just as Adar had said, Polly had been working hard for two hours but still could not restore the surveillance. How could ye Zao Restore the surveillance after only ten minutes? ”

There was only one reason.

“When Polly’s immediate efforts were about to see the results, ye Zao sat in front of Polly’s computer and stole the results of Polly’s work. ”

“Smith was, after all, a citizen of F Nation. He would definitely subconsciously stand beside Adar. ”

Smith turned to look at Ye Zao. “Miss Ye...”

“Ye Zao’s expression was indifferent. Obviously, he did not take this matter to heart, “Since Mr. Adar cares so much about who restored the surveillance camera, then I’ll give it to him! The most important thing now is to find Carl. Miss Smith, I have a request.” ”

“”What do you mean give it to me? The surveillance camera was originally restored by Polly!”Adar was furious. “Do we, the great F nation, still need you to give it to us!” ”

“If he had not seen it with his own eyes, Adar would never have believed that there was someone as thick-skinned as ye Zao in this world. ”

How Shameless!

At this moment.

Chris rushed in from outside the door. “Deputy Executive Officer! Where’s Miss Ye?”

The deputy executive officer turned around. “She’s Here! What’s Wrong?”

“Chris continued, “All the computers on the first floor have been controlled by L. quickly get Miss Ye to go over and take a look!” ”

“Just now, when ye Zao was restoring the surveillance on the first floor, Chris was also there. ”

“Ye Zao only used ten minutes to restore the surveillance, alarming L. with his toes, it was obvious why L. Was Here! ”

“L had never met an opponent in his career, ye Zao should be the first. ”

“How could this be!”The Deputy Executive’s expression changed.

“There was a secret room on the first floor, all the important documents were stored in the computer in the secret room. ”

“If there is a failure on the first floor that can not be fixed, then the whole Selead branch will be greatly weakened! ”
