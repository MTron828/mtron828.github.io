Chapter 456: 125: Scum will never be late. Everyone was dumbfounded. Ye Zao was Miracle Doctor Ye! 1

Translator: 549690339

Cen Yuyan looked at ye Zao with a smile on her face.

Ye Zao was a doctor.

But he was just a nobody.

How could she know Gu Dening?

“After all, Gu Dening was now a globally renowned professor. Every country was lining up to invite her to participate in medical experiments. This year’s appointment was already three years in the future. ”

“If song Chenyu and Gu Dening did not have a close relationship, an ordinary person would not be able to invite gu dening. ”

“Therefore, Cen Yuyan’s words were also intended to embarrass ye Zao. ”

“When Gu Dening saw ye Zao, she was extremely shocked. She thought that she was hallucinating and asked in surprise, “Miss Ye?” ”

“Doctor Gu.”Ye Zao raised his eyebrows in surprise.

She also didn’t expect to meet Gu Dening in the Cen family.

“Until ye Zao opened his mouth, Gu De Ning dare to believe that this is not an illusion, “Miss Ye! It really is you!” ”

“”Is me.”Ye zhuo slightly nods, “Gu doctor you are not wrong.” ”

“GU de-ning said excitedly, “Miss Ye, didn’t I already tell you? You can call me Xiao Gu from now on.”Although she was older than ye Zhuo, but in front of ye Zhuo, gu dening really couldn’t bear to be called ‘Doctor Gu’by her ”

Ye Zhuo was really too outstanding!

Her strength had long surpassed her age.

Xiao Gu?

Cen Yuyan was dumbfounded.

The others at the side were also dumbfounded.

“No one expected that gu dening actually knew ye Zhuo, and Gu dening actually made ye Zhuo call her Xiao Gu? ”

What was going on?

Cen Yuyan felt like she was hallucinating!

This was gu dening!

“Apart from Miracle Doctor Ye, she was the second person to conquer cancer! ”

Why was ye Zao called Gu Dening Xiao Gu?

Cen Yuyan frowned.

“Today was the day Cen Shaoqing brought his girlfriend back. After learning that song Chenyu and Gu Dening were old friends for many years, she deliberately revealed to song Chenyu that Zhou Xiang had been feeling unwell recently. ”

She asked Song Chenyu to invite Gu Dening to treat Zhou Xiang.

It was so that Cen Shaoqing’s girlfriend would retreat after seeing the outstanding song Chenyu.

“After all, not everyone had the chance to get to know gu dening. ”

“Song Chenyu was not only good-looking, but also talented! ” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

She did not expect it.

She did not expect ye Zhuo to actually know gu dening...

This sudden change made Cen Yuyan dumbfounded.

Song Chenyu was also a little confused.

She also did not expect that there would be a second person who knew gu dening in the Cen family.

Gu dening asked ye Zhuo to call her ‘Little Gu’. Could it be that ye Zhuo and gu dening were related?

What the hell was going on?

Old Madam Cen was amused.

Her silly fourth granddaughter and song Chenyu wanted to use gu dening to show off in front of everyone. They did not expect to be slapped in the face by her granddaughter-in-law!

They had failed to steal the chicken and lost the rice!

This feeling was too great!

“GU dening continued, “By the way, Miss Ye, why are you here too?” ”

Ye Zhuo smiled slightly and introduced Cen Shaoqing to Gu Dening. “This is my boyfriend.”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly at Gu Dening.

Gu dening widened her eyes in disbelief.

It seemed that she did not expect Cen fifth master and Ye Zhuo to be boyfriend and girlfriend.

“Old Mrs. Cen was really curious about the relationship between Gu Dening and ye Zao. She continued to ask, “Little Doctor Gu, do you know our Ye Zi as well?” ”

“GU dening said, “Old Mrs. Cen, not only do I know Miss Ye, but Miss Ye is also my mentor. If it weren’t for her, I wouldn’t have achieved what I have today!” ”

Gu dening was not an ungrateful person.

She had always remembered ye Zhuo’s kindness.

Mentor?

As soon as gu dening said this.

The air instantly fell silent.

Old Madam Cen originally thought that ye Zhuo and gu dening were at most good friends. She didn’t expect her granddaughter-in-law to be so amazing!

Mentor!

Mentor?

Old Madam Cen suddenly reacted.

Could it be...

Ye Zhuo was Miracle Doctor Ye?

“After all, Miracle Doctor Ye was the one who personally taught gu dening how to cure cancer. ”

Zhou Xiang and old Madam Cen had the same thought.

The two of them looked at each other and saw the surprise in each other’s eyes!

“Old Madam Cen turned to look at Gu dening and said excitedly, “You said that our Ye Zi is your master?” ”

Gu dening nodded.

“Hearing that, Cen Yuyan raised her head in disbelief. “T-doctor gu, don’t joke around! You’re the second person to conquer cancer. How Can Miss Ye Be Your Teacher?” ”

Ye Zhuo was only 19 years old this year and had just entered his first year of university.

“Although she also knew some medical skills, how could she compare to song Chenyu? ”

Could Ye Zhuo’s medical skills be better than Gu Dening’s?
