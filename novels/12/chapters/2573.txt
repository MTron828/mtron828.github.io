Like an unreachable flower.

No wonder an Lizi was willing to live under someone else’s roof and be a stepdaughter.

Being a stepdaughter was really worth it!

“If not for being Lin Qingxuan’s stepdaughter, would an Lizi know big shots like Ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing? ”

“After all, her horizons were too short. ”

“Li hang smiled and said, “Miss Ye, your skin is really good. Compared to you, even movie stars are inferior by more than a third!” ”

“Thank you.”Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Li hang continued, “What kind of skincare products does miss ye usually use?” ”

“”Ziyang,”ye Zao answered. ”

Ziyang?

Li Hang was stunned.

Ziyang was a very inconspicuous brand. would someone like ye Zao use such an inconspicuous skincare product?

It was obvious that he was not telling the truth!

“He originally thought that ye Zao was easy to get along with. He did not expect that the moment he opened his mouth, the distance between the two of them had widened. ”

She was still too naive!

“For a person like her, without a stepfather like an Lizi, how could she be worthy of making friends with Ye Zao. ”

“Li hang smiled and said, “So Ziyang’s effects are so good. I’ll try Ziyang Tomorrow.” ”

“Third Cousin’s wife smiled and said, “I also used Ziyang. The effects are indeed good.” ”

“So you also used Ziyang?”Li Hang looked at third cousin’s wife.

“Yes.”Third Cousin sister-in-law nodded with a smile. “It was also fiery who recommended me to use it.”

“”Then I must give it a try,”Li Hang said with a smile. ”

“Although she was smiling on the surface, in her heart, she had already begun to scold third cousin sister-in-law for being hypocritical. ”

“A top-notch noblewoman like them should not even bother to look at Ziyang, right? ”

“Actually, what Li Hang was annoyed about was not that they did not use Ziyang. Instead, he was disgusted with their hypocritical faces, which they were obviously unwilling to admit even though they had used even more high-end skincare products. ”

“After three rounds, Ye Zhuo had already made three rounds. ”

“Third Cousin’s wife smiled and said, “Shaoqing, you are not allowed to help little twelve this time! If this continues, the few of us will even lose to you and your wife!” ”

Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads. “It’s third cousin who is giving in to us.”

“”Talking to a cultured person is really different,”third cousin’s wife said with a smile. ”

Ye Zhuo looked at Cen Shaoqing. “I can almost play.”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Mahjong was very simple. Although they had only played three rounds, Ye Zhuo had almost grasped the rules. ”

“Although the second round did not have Cen Shaoqing’s guidance, Ye Zhuo still played mahjong. ”

“Li Hang said as he shuffled the cards, “Miss Ye is really amazing. At that time, I only learned mahjong for one day. Unlike Miss Ye, who just learned the rules and could already play mahjong.” ”

“Li Hang had no other skills, but he had a glib tongue. She did not even offend a three-year-old child, so she was like a fish in water in the circle. Her advice was harsh to the ear, and people liked to listen to pretty words. ”

“Although she had just met third cousin’s wife, third cousin’s wife already had a very good impression of her. ”

“Hearing this, third cousin’s wife immediately nodded in agreement. “Hang Hang is right. This smart person is different after all.” ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “He was just lucky.” ”

“”Luck is also a part of strength,”Li Hang continued. ”

Ye Zhuo was indeed lucky.

“Not only was she beautiful, she was also born into a top-tier wealthy family. ”

“Her father was the head of the Lin family. Although her mother was born ordinary, she was also a famous entrepreneur. She was the Mrs. Lin that everyone envied. ”

Her brother was the founder of the LK Group.

Her sister-in-law was a famous history writer.

She was also knowledgeable and stood at the top of the technology world. Even finding a fiancé was a big shot.

This life was like cheating!

“If not for her good luck, how could ye Zhuo have been born with all these? ”

“After a few rounds, the fourth cousin-in-law came over to join in the fun. “Who won and who lost?” ”

“Li hang continued, “Miss Ye won the first half. Third cousin-in-law won the second half. I was the only one who lost.” ”

“And I also lost!”Zhao Pingting continued.

“Li hang smiled and said, “Then we lost.” ”

“Ye Zhuo yawned and looked at fourth cousin-in-law. “Fourth cousin-in-law, do you want to play?” ”

“”Little Twelve, you play. I’ll watch.” ”

“Ye Zhuo pulled Cen Shaoqing up from the chair. “I’ve been sitting for too long. My back hurts. Fourth cousin-in-law, why don’t you play a game? Let’s go out for a walk.” ”

It was too stuffy inside.

“”Alright, I’ll play a game.”The fourth cousin-in-law rolled up her sleeves and sat down. ”

Ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing walked out.

“Seeing ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing walk out, Li Hang couldn’t sit still anymore. He wanted to follow them out, but he couldn’t find an excuse for a while. ”

He could only continue playing mahjong.

Ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing came outside.
