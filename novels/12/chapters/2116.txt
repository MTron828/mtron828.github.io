Cen Haifeng turned to look at Ye Zao. “Then I’ll have to trouble the two of you.”

“”It’s no trouble,”ye Zao said. ”

Cen Haifeng followed the two of them to the aircraft.

“The warm aircraft made Cen Haifeng’s thoughts clear up a lot. “I don’t think the two of you are from the General Alliance, Right?” ”

“Ye Zao nodded. “My name is Zhuo Ye, and this is my boyfriend Shao Qing. We’re both from Changyue.” ”

“Cen Haifeng stood up. “Thank you so much for today, Miss Zhuo and Mr. Shao. My surname is Cen. You can call me uncle Cen. I’ll definitely repay both of you in the future!” ”

“”Uncle Cen, you’re too polite.”Ye Zhuo continued, “But why did you faint in the snow by yourself?” ”

“Speaking of this, Cen Haifeng’s face was filled with a distant expression. “It’s a long story.” ”

“Ye Zhuo did not ask further and continued, “By the way, Uncle Cen, do you know that there is an ancient forbidden clan living in the Northwest Region?” ”

“”Miss Zhuo, why are you asking about this?”CEN Haifeng continued, “Could it be...” ”

Some of them were also affected by the forbidden clan?

“Ye Zhuo continued, “To tell you the truth, I am the descendant of the Forbidden Clan’s fifth lunar month, but my ancestor has long passed away. I grew up in the state of Changyue and only know that the forbidden clan is in the northwest region. My boyfriend and I have searched this area for a long time, but we still haven’t found them! I wonder if they have already moved away!” ”

“At the end of his sentence, Ye Zhuo sighed. ”

“”Miss Zhuo! You, you are really the descendant of the fifth clan?”Hearing this, Cen Haifeng’s eyes flashed with excitement. ”

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Then why do you have the surname Zhuo?”Cen Haifeng asked.

The descendant of the fifth clan should have the surname fifth.

“”It’s like this,”ye Zhuo explained. “When the ancestor was still alive, he violated the clan rules and was stripped of his surname. He was chased out of the northwest province and wandered all the way to the state of Changyue. Later on, he settled down in the state of Changyue.” ”

Cen Haifeng narrowed his eyes. He didn’t know much about the Forbidden Arts clan.

“However, when ye Zhuo said this, he seemed to have recalled something. Sixty years ago, the sole heir of the fifth family, fifth lanyue, fell in love with a foreign man and violated the clan rules. He was chased out of the General Alliance. From then on, he took his husband’s surname. ”

“”I see.”Cen Haifeng nodded and continued, “Then I wonder if Miss Zhuo’s ancestor passed the method to unlock the forbidden technique to Miss Zhuo?” ”

“Ye Zhuo did not directly answer him. Instead, he said, “I came here just to fulfill a dying wish of my ancestor. I will kowtow in front of the ancestral hall on her behalf. Don’t worry, I absolutely have no other thoughts!” ”

“”Miss Zhuo, you have misunderstood me,”Cen Haifeng said. “I have nothing to do with the forbidden clan. To be honest, I suspect that I have been affected by the forbidden technique, causing me to forget a lot of my memories. If Miss Zhuo knows how to lift the forbidden technique, could you please help me take a look?” ”

“Although Cen Haifeng did not know ye Zao, he could feel that the couple in front of him were definitely not bad people. ”

He believed them.

“You were hit by a forbidden spell?”Ye Zao looked at Cen Haifeng.

“Cen Haifeng first nodded, then shook his head. “I don’t know either.” ”

“After saying that, he continued, “I always feel like I’ve forgotten a lot of things. Miss Zhuo, can you help me take a look?” ”

“For example, Duanmu Huangfei told him that those people on Earth were the widows of his good brothers. ”

He always felt that something was very wrong.

That was why he insisted on bringing them back to the s galaxy.

“Originally, during this trip to the northwest region, he thought that he would be able to recall those lost memories. ”

Who knew that he would actually make a trip for nothing.

“Although the clan leader clearly told him that he wasn’t bound by the forbidden spell, Cen Haifeng still felt that something was wrong. ”

The clan leader and the others definitely had something to hide from him.

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Then, in that case, you are also here to look for the forbidden spell clan?” ”

“Yes.”Cen Hai Feng nodded his head without hiding anything.

“Then they didn’t release you from the Forbidden Spell?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“Cen Hai Feng shook his head, “They said that I wasn’t affected by the forbidden spell. Miss Zhuo, please help me. To be honest, I always feel that my entire life has been a lie.”If he was busy, then forget it.., in his spare time, those fragmented memories would always appear in his mind. ”

“But when he thought about it carefully, he couldn’t remember anything. ”

It was very strange.

“Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips opened slightly, “People always like to find excuses for their mistakes. Perhaps twenty years is just a snap of the fingers for some fickle lovers, but for those who value loyalty, it feels like years.”In these twenty years.., zhou Xiang seemed to be living well, but in fact, she was living in torment every day. ”
