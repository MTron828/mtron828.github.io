Translator: 549690339

“After Jin Xi en finished his sentence, Jin Yuyan was stunned. Her back was drenched in cold sweat and her face was filled with disbelief. She even thought that she had heard wrongly. ”

She was stripped of her status as the eldest princess and demoted to a commoner. She was banished from the royal family forever.

How could this be?

“Secretary Zhou, who was beside Jin Yuyan, was also extremely shocked. He hurriedly knelt down, “Your Majesty, Please Reconsider! The eldest princess is your most beloved daughter! If she does something wrong, you can punish her however you want. You absolutely can not demote the eldest princess to a commoner!” ”

What did Jin Yuyan do wrong to make Jin Xi en so angry!

“Just a week ago, Jin Xi en had mentioned to Secretary Zhou about passing on the throne. He did not expect that in just a few days, Jin Xi en would cripple Jin Yuyan. ”

It was unreal.

Too Unreal!

Secretary Zhou felt that he was dreaming.

“If it was not a dream, why would Jin Xi en suddenly Cripple Jin Yuyan? ”

Secretary Zhou secretly pinched his thigh.

Hiss!

It was very painful.

It was very obvious that this was not a dream.

“”Blame it on her for offending someone she shouldn’t have offended!”Jin Xi en was very angry. “Fortunately, Miss Ye is fine! If anything were to happen to miss ye, not to mention demoting her to a commoner, even if she had ten lives, it would not be enough to compensate!” ”

“Jin Xi en had always liked Jin Yuyan, this eldest daughter. ”

“But this time, Jin Yuyan really let her down. ”

“Although Jin Yuyan was a princess of a country, in the end, Korea was only a small country. Jin Yuyan actually relied on her identity as the eldest princess to misbehave outside. It was fine if nothing happened in the past, but now that she had offended a big shot.., she could only pay the price of blood! ”

“Jin Yuyan was very regretful now and cried bitterly, “I was wrong! Mother, I was really wrong! Please give me a chance to change! I promise, I promise that I will never do this again!” ”

“”What’s the use of admitting your mistakes now!”Jin Xi en continued, “When you were acting recklessly outside with your identity as the eldest Princess of Korea, why didn’t you think of Now?” ”

“”Mother!”Jin Yuyan hugged Jin Xi’en’s leg, unwilling to let go. “Mother, mother, I beg you!” ”

She was the Grand Princess of Korea and was going to inherit the throne in the future. How could she be demoted to a commoner and expelled from the Imperial Family?

No Way!

“She was born to be superior. If she was demoted to a commoner at this time, how could she live in the future? ”

“Secretary Zhou also pleaded, “Your Majesty, no matter what, the eldest princess is your biological daughter. Please forgive the eldest princess this time for the sake of mother and daughter! I believe that the eldest princess will definitely not do it again in the future!” ”

“”This matter is already a foregone conclusion. No matter how much you say, it’s futile. Go Out!”Jin Xi’en waved her hand tiredly. She only hoped that the person would not vent his anger on her. ”

“Right now, the Jin family’s foundation in the royal family was weak. If there were any more incidents this time, the person in power in Korea would probably be replaced. ”

“If she forcefully protected Jin Yuyan, it would only bring disaster to the Jin family. ”

“Mother!”

“Her Majesty the Empress!”

Jin Xi’en did not speak anymore. He dialed the internal line and let the Chamberlain in.

“Seeing Jin Xi’en’s chamberlain enter, Jin Yuyan knew that she was completely finished this time. ”

“Jin Yuyan raised her head and looked at Jin Xi en, almost hysterically shouting, “Mother! I need a reason to kill someone! Why are you punishing me like this! What is Ye Zao’s identity to make you protect her like this! is my biological daughter inferior to an outsider?” ”

What was ye Zao’s identity!

“Before Jin Yuyan made her move, she had clearly checked. ”

Ye Zao was just a very ordinary Chinese university student.

Could it be that ye Zao was Jin Xi En’s illegitimate daughter?ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Otherwise, why would Jin Xi en protect her so much? ”

“The more Jin Yuyan thought about it, the more she felt that it was possible! ”

“After all, she had offered such a high condition for ye Zao to join Korea, but ye Zao did not agree to it. ”

Who would refuse such an exorbitant wealth?

“”Then I’ll let you die today!”Jin Xi en looked at Jin Yu Yan and continued, “Miss ye is fifth master’s fiancée! Is this reason enough?” ”

Boom!

Jin Yu Yan was struck by lightning. Her face immediately turned pale and she collapsed on the ground. Her face was like dead wood and ashes.

Fifth Master.

The person behind ye Zao was actually fifth master.

“How, how could this be! ”

No Wonder Jin Xi’en was so angry.

Secretary Zhou’s face was also full of shock.

Fifth Master.

“Fifth Master had the ability to help the Jin family to the top, so he had the ability to bring the Jin family back to its original state. ”
