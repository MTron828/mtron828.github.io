“Hearing Manxing’s words, Zhao Dan’s emotions slowly calmed down. He nodded and said, “Alright, then you can check first. Remember to tell me as soon as you’re done.” ”

“Okay.”Manxing nodded.

In another room.

Manwen heard the conversation coming from the earpiece and frowned slightly.

Could it be that young master Dongli’s girlfriend was really ye Zhuo?

Then what should he do now?

He had to think of a way to inform ye Zhuo of this news so that she could make a perfect plan.

“But, how should he inform her? ”

Man Wen fell into deep thought.

“No matter what, he couldn’t let these people pester ye Zhuo. ”

The man family already owed her enough.

...

On the other side.

In the General Alliance.

“Mrs. Duanmu stood in the crowd and turned to look at Duanmu Fengyu. She said in a low voice, “It seems that your aunt and I have underestimated this Zhou Xiang.” ”

“”Mom, What’s Wrong?”Duanmu Fengyu was stunned. ”

“Mrs. Duanmu said, “Look at that move of hers. She is obviously trying to make your uncle pity her.” ”

“If Zhou Xiangzhen did not have any feelings for Cen Haifeng and only had resentment, she would not have come forward to plead for Cen Haifeng. ”

She was obviously trying to attract Cen Haifeng’s attention.

“”What about Auntie!”Duanmu fengyu continued, “We can’t let this woman take Auntie’s position!” ”

The thought of Zhou Xiang replacing Duanmu Fengyu disgusted Duanmu Fengyu.

How could Zhou Xiang compare to Duanmu Fengfei?

What right did she have to replace Duanmu Fengyu?

Only Duanmu Fengyu was the most honorable woman in the S Galaxy!

“”If you can’t bear it, you’ll mess up big plans.”Mrs. Duanmu continued, “From now on, you have to be closer to Zhou Xiang than you are to your aunt.” ”

Only in this way could duanmu Fengyu win Zhou Xiang’s favor.

“Duanmu fengyu also felt that she would be able to bear it. However, after seeing Zhou Xiang, she realized that she couldn’t bear it at all. ”

Not even for a minute.

“In her eyes, besides Duanmu Fengfei, no one else was worthy to stand shoulder to shoulder with Cen Haifeng. ”

How could Duanmu Fengyu not be angry that her uncle had been snatched away? Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“”Fengyu, you have to bear with it now.”Mrs. Duanmu continued, “Even if it’s not for yourself, it’s for your aunt.” ”

Duanmu fengyu bit her lip and nodded.

“”Didn’t you say that the young master of Dongli also came back with him?”Duanmu Liangchen walked over from the side. “Fengyu, have you seen the young master of Dongli?” ”

Duanmu fengyu shook her head.

“”He should still be at the back,”Mrs. Duanmu said. ”

“The corridor leading to the headquarters was very long. Standing there, they could only see old Mrs. Cen walking in the front and not the people behind her. ”

“At this moment, a burst of exclamations came from the crowd. ”

“Then, there were discussions. ”

“”That’s the young master of Dongli, right?” ”

“He’s so handsome!”

“”Although the woman from Earth walking beside him is quite beautiful, she’s still an earthling after all. It’s more like an earthling giving birth to a child for the young master. However, it’s a little whimsical for her to sit in the position of the wife of the Chief Alliance.” ”

“I’m just afraid that some people don’t think that way. Would a person who has been a phoenix ever want to be a sparrow again?”

How could that be possible!

“”If she doesn’t leave after giving birth, what about Miss Duanmu?” ”

“In the hearts of the people of the General Alliance, only the daughter of the Duanmu family was qualified to be the wife of the General Alliance. ”

“As for the Earthling in front of her, other than her face, she couldn’t even compare to half of Duanmu Feng. ”

“Do you know the name of this earthling?”

“What’s her name?”

“Ye Zao.”

“Ye Zao? Just Her? She deserves it!”

The surrounding people immediately burst into laughter.

Duanmu Feng raised her head and saw a stunning face.

“The man was more than a head taller than the people around him. His body was like a jade tree, and his face was like a crown of jade. The old-fashioned long gown he wore made him look refined and refined. He exuded an incomparable powerful aura. ”

“At this moment, apart from the sound of her own heartbeat, Duanmu Fengyu could not hear any other sounds. ”

“In the past, Duanmu Fengyu had never known what it meant when a stranger was like Jade and the young master was unparalleled in the world. ”

It was only at this moment that she understood.

So there really was someone in the world who could reach this realm.

“In a blink of an eye, Duanmu Fengyu saw the side profile of Ye Zhuo, and her expression changed. ”

This Earthling’s appearance was somewhat out of her expectations.

She originally thought that her appearance was already outstanding enough.

Who knew...

“Her appearance was even worse than an Earthling’s. To Duanmu Fengyu, it was a humiliation. ”

“She was an outstanding earthling from the s galaxy. Logically speaking, she should be a hundred times more beautiful than this earthling. ”

“Thinking of this, Duanmu Fengyu clenched her fists. ”
