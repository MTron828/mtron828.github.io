“Chapter 1225: 259: a Tiger Father does not have a dog son. If you do not seek death, you will not die! 1”

Surname Ye?

For some reason.

Father Zhao did not have a good impression of the surname Ye.

“However, the other party might be his biological son after all. ”

“As long as he could find his son, what did it matter what his surname was? ”

“Thinking of this, the disgust on Father Zhao’s face lessened a little. He continued, “Where is Ziye’s specific address?” ”

“The butler continued, “The exact address hasn’t been sent over yet. I heard from the detective that young master has made some achievements in the capital and is doing very well!” ”

“Hearing this, Father Zhao smiled and said, “Like father, like Son! How can my son be bad?” ”

“You’re right.”The Butler immediately agreed.

“At this moment, the Butler’s phone rang. The Butler picked up the phone and looked at it. He then said, “Master, the detective has already sent over the address. He is now asking, when should we go over to take a look?” ”

“”Tomorrow!”Father Zhao continued, “We will go over first thing in the morning.” ”

This was related to his son.

“If it wasn’t for the fact that the sky was already dark, father Zhao would have flown over immediately. ”

“Okay.”The housekeeper nodded. “Then I will immediately make the arrangements.”

“Go.”

“On this side, the housekeeper had just left when the assistant returned. ” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“What exactly happened at the Ming family’s birthday banquet?”Father Zhao raised his head to look at the assistant.

“Hearing this, the assistant’s expression didn’t look too good. ”

“Speak!”

The assistant couldn’t bear the pressure and bent down slightly. He lowered his head and whispered a few words in Father Zhao’s ear.

Father Zhao’s expression became uglier and uglier. Even his eyebrows were about to knit together.

He had never thought that this would be the result!

He had been thrown out as a mental patient.

And it was in front of the entire banquet hall.

One had to know that the people in the banquet hall today were all influential figures in the financial world.

Long face.

“Zhao Xueyin, this outstanding daughter, had really given him a lot of face! ”

“This matter wasn’t over yet. When Father Zhao heard that the lawyer was Jin Ruyu, he was so angry that he even threw out his favorite pipe. ”

What kind of stupid thing did Zhao Xueyin do!

“Vile daughter! Vile daughter!”

“If Zhao Xueyin had listened to her words, she would not have ended up in this state. ”

This was great.

“If the East did not succeed, the West did not. She even became a lunatic. ”

Who would dare to marry Zhao Xueyin in the future?

“Father Zhao originally thought that without fifth master, the Zhao family could rely on the Jin family to rise again. ”

He did not expect...

He didn’t expect that everything would be ruined by Zhao Xueyin’s hands.

“If Zhao Xueyin didn’t do it, she would be the young madam of the Jin family now. ”

“Her heart was as high as the sky, and her life was as thin as paper! ”

“Father Zhao was so angry that his head hurt. If he had a heart attack, he would have had a heart attack by now. ”

“”Master, Please Calm Down.”The assistant didn’t know how to comfort Father Zhao, so he continued, “Since it has already happened, it’s useless for you to be angry...” ”

“At this moment, Father Zhao couldn’t listen to anything else. He walked upstairs. ”

“Master!”The assistant immediately followed Father Zhao’s footsteps.

“”Don’t follow me!”Father Zhao roared, “I’m going to beat that wicked daughter to death today!” ”

“Out of sight, out of mind! ”

Perhaps no one could understand father Zhao’s feelings.

That feeling was even worse than losing a hundred million!

He had said long ago that the lawyer was a good backup plan and told Zhao Xueyin not to offend the lawyer.

But Zhao Xueyin always turned a deaf ear to his words!

It was all right now!

“Zhao Xueyin had done things so ruthlessly, would the lawyer still turn back? ”

A good horse would not turn back!

The lawyer was not a fool.

Father Zhao went straight to the third floor and knocked on the door of Zhao Xueyin’s room.

“”Unfilial daughter! Open the door for me! Open the door, I’ll kill you today. Just pretend that I never raised you as a daughter.” ”

Zhao Xueyin lay on the bed and covered her head with the blanket as she cried.

“Father Zhao felt bad, and so did she. ”

Who knew that lawyer Si was Jin Ruyu?

“If she had known that lawyer Si had such a powerful background, she definitely would not have done things so ruthlessly. ”

Regret!

Very Regret!

Very Regret.

“Seeing that Zhao Xueyin did not open the door, Father Zhao became even angrier. “Bring me the Ax!” ”

“The assistant was afraid that someone would really die. Cold sweat was dripping down his forehead. “Old, Old Master...” ”

“I told you to get the Ax!”

“At this moment, the Butler heard the news and rushed over. “Old Master, What are you doing? Why Are You So Angry?” ”

“Father Zhao kicked the butler, “Are you deaf? I want you to get an axe and split the door open for me!” ”

“”No, you can’t do that.”The Butler hugged Father Zhao, then, he said, “Master, even if miss has done something terrible, you can’t use a knife or a gun! There are some things that can not be undone! Please calm down.” ”
