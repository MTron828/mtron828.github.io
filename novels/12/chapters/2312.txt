Cen Lao er was Cen Lao Zi.

“In the past, the Cen family’s Old Master had adopted a child, then Cen Lao Zi. ”

“As she spoke, Cen Lao Zi’s eyes became redder and redder. She wiped away her tears, then, she said, “Originally, I could have been a little sadder, but who asked you to act like that for the rest of your life! Forget it, forget it. You’ve already left, so why should I bother with you? ! “It’s my fault for calling you old white lotus in the past. Please don’t scare me at Night!” ”

“As she finished speaking, Old Madam Cen walked to the front of the hotel and looked at her old friend lying in the ice coffin. Her expression was very complicated. ”

Old Madam Lin’s body had always been fine. She left just like that without even saying goodbye. Did this mean something?

“What if one day, just like Old Lady Lin, something unexpected happened to her? ” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Old Lady Lin Sighed deeply.

“She was not afraid of death, but she had yet to see Cen Shaoqing get married and have a child. ”

How could she leave?

“Old Lady Cen continued, “If there is a spirit in heaven, please bless me not to be like you. I want to see Shaoqing and Luoluo get married. Luoluo is your only granddaughter. You definitely can’t bear to see her sad, right? “Let me tell you, Luoluo likes me the most as a grandmother! “If I leave first, she will definitely be very sad!” ”

“Then it’s a deal. You must protect me!”

“After saying a few words and bowing in front of old Mrs. Lin’s spirit, old Mrs. Cen turned around and left. ”

The custom in the capital was to go to the front hall to have a bowl of tea after mourning the deceased.

A group of people gathered in the front hall.

“After drinking the tea, Old Mrs. Cen went to the garden for a stroll. She happened to bump into Cen Shaoqing and ye Zhuo chatting with their children in the garden. ”

“Looking from afar, the scene was somewhat harmonious. Old Mrs. Cen could even see through this scene what it would be like if she had a great-grandson in the future. ”

It would definitely be as warm as it was now.

“The sadness in Old Mrs. Cen’s heart instantly faded a lot. The corners of her mouth rose slightly, and she suddenly felt that death was not so scary anymore. ”

“After all, she had already seen what she wanted to see. ”

“Three days later, Old Mrs. Lin was officially buried. ”

The funeral procession was very long.

“Coincidentally, the originally sunny weather actually started to rain the moment everyone arrived at the cemetery. ”

“The Daoist priest dressed in bright yellow Daoist robes pinched his fingers and said, “From a feng shui point of view, the wealth of the water level coincides with the rain when the old lady is buried. This means that the old lady is a person of great fortune. The future generations will have good weather and good fortune along the way!” ”

People naturally liked to listen to auspicious words.

“Under the Taoist priest’s words, some people even stopped holding umbrellas, hoping to get more rain. ”

“After all, rain was equal to wealth. Getting more rain was equal to getting more wealth. ”

...

“In the blink of an eye, a month had passed. ”

Ye Zao was very busy during this period of time. He often stayed at Mount Mars for three to five days.

“As the oasis project was approaching, everyone was keeping an eye on the CEN base. At this critical moment, the project could not have any problems. ”

Everyone was waiting for ye Zao to announce the success of the OASIS project.

“Of course, there would also be objections. ”

“After all, ye Zao wanted to transform Mars. ”

What kind of place was Mars?

“There was no air, and the temperature was as low AS-63 degrees Celsius. The mass was only 14% of Earth’s, and the gravitational acceleration was only 40% of Earth’s. In such an environment, ye Zao would not be able to nurture any green plants no matter what. ”

“Seeing that there was only a week left until the OASIS Project’s planning period, and there was still no news from Mars, country C and Country L began to stir, the Science and technology website was full of topics about Professor YC’s OASIS project plan. ”

“[ how grand the launch of the aircraft carrier was back then, how terrible the fall of YC will be now! ] ”

“[ in the blink of an eye, so much time has passed! I always thought that the launch of the aircraft carrier was yesterday. ] ”

“[ what can I say? It has been two years. Other than China, no other country has developed a second aircraft carrier that shocked the world. As the first country in technology, China is a model for us to learn from. ]. [ instead of slander, some results do not exist just because of slander. ] ”

[ do you know that there is a word in China called Licking Dogs? ]

“[ licking until the end, nothing. ] ”

“[ YC’s results are undeniable. She is the first in technology, so it is undeniable. However, everyone has to admit that in recent years, YC did not have any other achievements other than the aircraft carrier. Now, it seems that the Mars project has been ruined. ] ”

“[ is the person above joking? What do you mean there are no other achievements other than the aircraft carrier project? One aircraft carrier can directly ascend to godhood, okay? In ancient China, people like her had to set up temples to ascend to Godhood! ] ”
