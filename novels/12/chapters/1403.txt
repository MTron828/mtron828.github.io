Translator: 549690339

[ I’m Crying Too! This is so infuriating. How can there be such a heartless person in the world? ]

[ Zhou Jinbei and Wu Lan are both bad people! ]

“[ brothers and sisters, let’s work hard. We must not let the popularity drop. Let the higher-ups take this matter seriously and remove Zhou Jinbei from his position. Let him receive the punishment he deserves! ] ”

“[ top, top, Top! ] ”

“[ Zhou Jinbei, get out of China. ] ”

“For a time, Zhou Jinbei’s Weibo and the official Weibo of the Zhou group were surrounded by netizens. ”

There were even netizens who had a strong sense of justice. They brought rotten eggs and rotten vegetables and threw them on the door of the Zhou Group.

The higher-ups of the Zhou group held an emergency meeting overnight. The public relations team deleted the comments and controlled the comments.

“However, the public opinion was too big. ”

Just the strength of the Zhou group alone was not enough to contend with it.

The matter became bigger and bigger.

“In just one night, it was irreparable. ”

“Just as the public relations team was busy, Zhou Jinbei called all the higher-ups for a video conference overnight. ”

“On the screen, the higher-ups were so anxious that their faces were pale. ”

“If they didn’t think of a way to stop public opinion, then the entire Zhou group would suffer as well. ”

They all relied on the Zhou group to survive.

“If the Zhou group was gone, they would also lose their jobs. ”

“The public relations manager looked at Zhou Jinbei’s calm face on the screen and said, “Director Zhou, you and old Mr. Zhou are biological father and son. As the saying goes, a tiger will not eat its own son. As long as you admit your mistake, old Mr. Zhou will definitely not hold a grudge against you.” ”

The person who solved the problem had to be the one who solved it.

“In the current situation, other than Zhou Jinbei personally appearing, there was no other way. ”

“Actually, the Zhou Group’s upper management all knew Zhou Zuolong very well. ”

“Over the years, he had caused a lot of trouble. ”

“However, not once was he as ruthless as this time. ”

“This time, it was as if he really wanted to kill Zhou Jinbei. ”

Zhou Jinbei’s expression was the same as ever. “Where’s manager Wang from the marketing department?”

Manager Wang from the marketing department?

What time was this!

Zhou Jinbei actually had the spare time to look for manager Wang from the marketing department!

Could it be that Zhou Jinbei was so anxious that he was dizzy and couldn’t even differentiate between priorities?

“The public relations department manager continued, “CEO Zhou, the most important thing right now is how to stop public opinion.” ”

“Zhou Jinbei flipped a page of the document in his hand, “The reason why I called for a video conference was to tell all of you not to be influenced by the outside world. Do what you normally do!”! “Zhu Gang, you’re the manager of the public relations department. You just need to maintain the image of the company. You Don’t need to interfere in this matter.” ”

“”But your image is the image of the company! CEO Zhou, haven’t You Seen the news yet? The netizens’mood is very high right now. If we still don’t take measures, our company will be finished!” ”

“”Don’t worry, it won’t be over.” ”

“Zhu gang’s expression was unclear as he continued, “CEO, CEO Zhou, are you sure?” ”

“Zhou Jinbei nodded. “Yes, I’m sure! If anything really happens, I’ll bear all the consequences alone!” ”

“No matter what was in Wu Lan’s suicide note, this time, he would definitely not compromise with Zhou Zuolong! ”

“Hearing this, the higher-ups in the meeting room were all stunned. ”

What did Zhou Jinbei Mean?

“Breaking the pot, breaking the fall? ! ”

“The vice president sitting on the left said, “President Zhou, you must not underestimate the power of public opinion. If you really intend to ignore this matter, the consequences are unimaginable.” ”

“”Don’t worry, I know better than any of you what the consequences will be,”Zhou Jinbei continued, “From now on, the company will return to normal order. The public relations department will no longer pay attention to Zhou Zuolong’s matter. That’s it, meeting adjourned! “Oh, right, vice president Qian, after the meeting adjourned, get manager Wang from the marketing department to come and look for me.” ” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Got it.”Vice President Qian nodded.

“In a moment, Zhou Jinbei directly cut off the video. ”

“On the other side, the meeting room was filled with discussions. ”

“What exactly is President Zhou up to?”

“Vice president Qian! Are We really going to sit back and do nothing?”

“”The matter has been blown to such a big extent, yet director Zhou was still able to laugh just now!” ”

“”Vice director Qian, why don’t our company send a representative to visit old Mr. Zhou and ask him to come forward and explain that all of this is a misunderstanding?” ”

Vice director Qian had followed Zhou Jinbei for a long time.

He knew that Zhou Jinbei was not the kind of person who did not know his limits.

Zhou Jinbei must have his own reasons for doing so.

“Vice President Qian closed the computer in front of him and looked up at the crowd. “Everyone, please calm down. We have been in the Zhou group for so many years and have survived many storms. I believe that we will definitely be able to survive this time!” ”

“”Although that’s what you said, but what President Zhou is doing is really worrying.”A senior executive stood out and said, “Vice President Qian, why don’t you go and persuade President Zhou again?” ”

“Vice president Qian said, “I know better than everyone here what kind of person President Zhou is. I believe that he must have his own motives for doing this. Alright, everyone go and do your work. Everything will be done according to President Zhou’s wishes!” ”

“Hearing this, everyone didn’t say anything else. ”

“After vice president Qian left, everyone whispered, “President Zhou and vice president Qian are like possessed. Our company is already like this now, but they are still indifferent!” ”

“”Forget it, forget it. We just need to do our job properly.” ”

“President Zhou is not willing to admit defeat to old Mr. Zhou. We can only do this now!”

The dozen or so higher-ups walked out as they spoke.

At the hospital.

“Looking at the front page of every news section that had Zhou Jinbei’s news, Zhou Zuolong was extremely pleased with himself. ”

“Without thinking, it was obvious that the Zhou Corporation was now in chaos. ”

“He wanted to see how long Zhou Jinbei, this unfilial son, could last. ”

“Originally, he only wanted Zhou Jinbei to come to the hospital to see him and Xie wanqiu. ”

Now...

He had to let Zhou Jinbei know how powerful he was as the head of the family. He would not forgive Zhou Jinbei if he did not make Zhou Jinbei pay the price.

“Xie wanqiu brought a glass of water to Zhou Zuolong. “Old man, if Jinbei comes to apologize to you later, don’t make things difficult for him. He’s still your son after all. As a child, it’s fine as long as he knows he’s wrong.” ”

“”A kind person is bullied. This time, I must make that unfilial son suffer a little!”Zhou Zuolong turned to look at Xie wanqiu. “Wanqiu, I know what to do about this. Don’t interfere.” ”

Xie wanqiu sighed.

“After saying that, Zhou Zuolong turned to look at Zheng Wanyin. “Yinyin.” ”

“”Grandpa, What’s Wrong?”Zheng Wanyin asked. ”

“Zhou zuolong continued, “Go to the hospital to go through the transfer procedures.” ”

“Zheng wanyin said in surprise, “Transfer? You mean to transfer grandma to another hospital?” ”

“Yes.”Zhou Zuolong nodded.

“Xie wanqiu said, “But if that’s the case, won’t Jinbei not be able to find us?” ”

“”I just want him to be unable to find us!”Zhou zuolong continued, “If we don’t make him anxious, he’ll never know who’s his father and who’s his son!” ”

“Not only did he want Zhou Jinbei to beg him, but he also wanted Zhou Jinbei to be anxious ”

He wanted Zhou Jinbei to know that his father would always be his father!

Zhou Jinbei was still too inexperienced to fight with his father.

“Hearing this, Xie wanqiu pretended to hesitate and said, “Old man, must we do this? I don’t think there’s a need to make things difficult for the child.” ”

“”Being soft-hearted is a disease. Wanqiu, from now on, you have to harden your heart! No matter what I do, you have to support me!” Zhou Zuolong turned to look at Zheng Wanyin. “Yinyin, quickly do it. By the way, don’t tell anyone other than your grandfather Wu about this!” ”

Zheng Wanyin looked up. “Even second aunt?”

“No.”

“Zhou Xiang and Zhou Jinbei were in the same boat. The reason why he arranged for Xie Wanqiu to be transferred was to make Zhou Jinbei anxious. If he told Zhou Xiang about this, why would he bother with this? ”

“Zheng Wanyin nodded. “I got it, Grandpa.” ”

“Zhou zuolong continued, “Go and do it now.” ”

“Alright.”

The transfer operation was done very quickly.

“While Zhou Zuolong was busy, Xie Rongle looked at Xie wanqiu. “Auntie, are you sure this will work? What if Zhou Jinbei can’t find us?” ”

“Xie wanqiu smiled and said, “Who is Zhou Jinbei? As long as he wants to, who can’t he find? “My Silly Girl, don’t let your imagination run wild. Just wait patiently to be the bride! “Your uncle said that after Zhou Jinbei comes, he will settle your matter and let Zhou Jinbei and Chu Ying get a divorce!” ”

“”Really?”Xie rongle continued, “What if Zhou Jinbei doesn’t agree?” ”

“Xie wanqiu narrowed her eyes. “Doesn’t agree? Does Zhou Jinbei Dare? Now that things have come to this, unless Zhou Jinbei really wants to lose his reputation, he has to listen to your uncle!” ”
