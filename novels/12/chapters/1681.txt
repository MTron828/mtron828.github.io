“In other words, Ye Zhuo would be back on the 9th at the earliest. ”

Professor Feng narrowed his eyes.

“Tang mi continued, “Professor Feng, why are you looking for Miss Ye? Do you need my help?” ”

“”Are you free now?”Professor Feng continued, “If you are free, come and help me take a look. Miss Ye isn’t here, so I can’t find anyone else.” ”

“”Okay, it just so happens that I’m not very busy right now,”Tang Mi said. ”

“Professor Feng smiled and said, “Then come with me!” ”

“Okay.”Tang Mi followed Professor Feng’s footsteps.

“Professor Feng took out his phone and looked at it. He quickly put it back into his pocket. As he walked, he chatted with Tang Mi. “Tang Mi, have you found a boyfriend?” ”

“Not yet.”Tang mi shook her head.

“Professor Feng smiled and said, “Then I’ll introduce you to one another another day.” ”

“”Thank you, Professor Feng.” ”

“Professor Feng said, “We’re all on the same side. You’re welcome.” ”

“After Tang Mi left for a short while, director Ma came to Tang Mi’s office. ”

“Is Tang Mi not here?”

“The assistant said, “Team leader Tang went to Professor Feng’s lab. Director Ma, why are you looking for her? I’ll help you look for her.” ”

“Director ma said, “It’s not a big deal. I just left a document with her. You specially went to look for her. She must be busy right now! I’ll look for her myself.” ”

“Seeing that director Ma was not an outsider, the assistant nodded. “Okay, thank you for your hard work.” ”

“”It’s nothing.”Director ma waved his hand and continued, “You go and do your work too!” ”

The assistant walked out.

“As soon as the assistant left, director Ma put away the smile on his face and quickly rummaged through Tang Mi’s desk. ”

“Five minutes later, director Ma walked out of Tang Mi’s office with a document in his hand. ”

“The assistant was working outside the office. When he saw director Ma walk out, he immediately stood up from his chair. “Director Ma, have you found it?” ”

Director ma smiled and nodded. “Yes.”

...

Zou family.

“The college entrance exam was the day after tomorrow, so the Zou family’s parents were very nervous. ”

“Zou’s mother said, “Feifei, you must work hard and get the top scorer in the market. Let everyone’s eyes light up!” ”

“Before this, Zou Feifei was also full of confidence. She felt that she would definitely get the top scorer in the market. ”

But now...

“Ever since she found out about Lin Sha’s results in the mock exam, she had been feeling uneasy and a little uncomfortable. ”

The top scorer in the college entrance exam was originally in her pocket. How could she not feel uncomfortable when it was suddenly snatched away by someone else?

“Feeling that Zou Feifei’s expression was a little strange, Zou’s mother continued to ask, “Feifei, are you not feeling well?” ”

“”No,”Zou feifei shook her head, “I’m Fine, Mom. You Don’t have to worry.” ”

“Zou’s mother said, “The college entrance exam is coming up soon. How can I not worry at a time like this! Feifei, if you feel uncomfortable, you have to say it immediately. Don’t hide it! It’s not good to delay the college entrance exam!” ”

“”Yes, I know.”Zou Feifei said. ”

“Zou’s mother continued, “I remember that your admission ticket has been issued, right?” ”

“Yes.”Zou feifei nodded.

“Mother Zou stretched out her hand towards Zou feifei, “Hurry up and hand over the admission ticket to me for safekeeping! If you lose the admission ticket, you won’t be able to enter the examination venue!”Every year, there would be news reports that examinees would miss the college entrance examination because they lost the admission ticket! ”

“Zou Feifei was going to be the champion of the college entrance examination, so she couldn’t miss the college entrance examination! ”

“The speaker didn’t mean it, but the listener did. Hearing this, Zou Feifei’s eyes lit up. ”

“If Lin Sha lost her admission ticket, she wouldn’t be able to take the college entrance examination? ”

Yes.

That was it.

“”Kid, I’m talking to you! What are you laughing at!”Zou’s mother patted Zou Feifei in dissatisfaction. ”

“Zou Feifei finally reacted and said, “Mom, don’t worry. I Won’t lose my admission ticket.” ”

“”Quickly bring it over and I’ll keep it. I Won’t be at ease leaving it with you,”Zou’s mother said. ”

“Okay.”Zou Feifei stood up from the chair. “I’ll go get it for you.”

“After a while, Zou Feifei came over with the admission ticket. Zou’s mother carefully put away the admission ticket and then felt relieved. “By the way, Will Your Aunt Come Back Tonight?” ”

“”I don’t know either,”zou feifei continued, “Mom, I’ll go back to my room to study first.” ”

“Hearing that Zou Feifei was going to study, Zou’s mother didn’t say anything more. ”

Zou Feifei went to the bedroom and took out his phone to send a message to Ning Lan.

He quickly figured out Lin Sha’s examination room.

“Coincidentally, Lin Sha was in the same examination room as him. ”

“Tomorrow, the examinees would go to the examination room in advance. At that time, Lin Sha would definitely be there. ”

“With an idea in his mind, Zou Feifei felt much more relaxed. ”

“At this moment, Zou Feifei seemed to think of something and frowned ”

“In the blink of an eye, it was the next day. ”

Zou Feifei agreed to go to the examination hall with Ning Lan.

“The examination hall was in the suburbs, an hour away from the city. ”

“At around ten in the morning, the two arrived at the examination hall. ” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“At this moment, Ning Lan suddenly grabbed zou feifei’s arm, “Feifei, look at Lin Sha!” ”

Zou Feifei looked back.

“Ning LAN continued, “Look at the girl next to Lin Sha. Isn’t she very beautiful? She has a unique temperament and looks like Dr. YC! I don’t know which school she is from!” ”

“Zou feifei snorted, “Isn’t she just a little more beautiful? Can Beauty be a meal? Dr. YC! I think she can’t even compare to Dr. YC’s pinky finger. What’s the use of looking like her? Even if she looks like him, she can only be an imposter!” ”

“Zou Feifei had been a proud daughter of heaven since she was young. She couldn’t stand to see others being better than her. First, Lin Sha’s mock exam results were higher than hers. Now, there was a beautiful beauty. Zou Feifei couldn’t accept it. ”

“However, when he thought about how that girl was only an imposter even though she was beautiful, Zou Feifei felt a lot better! ”

What was there to be proud of about an imposter?

“Zou feifei turned to look at Ning Lan and asked, “Did you bring your admission ticket?” ”

“I did.”Ning Lan nodded.

“Zou feifei said, “Then you have to take care of it. If you lose it, you won’t be able to take the college entrance exam.” ”

“”It’s okay.”Ning LAN said indifferently, “It’s different from before. You can download the admission ticket and print it online. If you really lose it, just print another one.” ”

What?

The admission ticket could be reprinted?

Zou Feifei’s face turned pale. “When did this happen?”

“Didn’t your teacher tell you?”Ning Lan asked.

Zou feifei shook her head.

“Ning Lan took out her phone and explained to Zou Feifei where to download the admission ticket. “Well, download it here and then go to the printing shop to print it.” ”

Zou Feifei’s heart turned cold. She had thought that she could steal Lin Sha’s admission ticket and prevent her from taking the college entrance examination. Who knew that the admission ticket could be printed at any time now!

Then what was the use of stealing the admission ticket?

It seemed that she had to think of other ways.

“Zou feifei narrowed his eyes and turned to look at Ning Lan. “Come, let’s go and say hello to Lin Sha.” ”

Ning Lan was stunned. “Are you familiar with her?”

“”I’ve met her twice.”Zou Feifei’s father was in the financial industry, and Lin Sha’s parents had borrowed a loan from the Zou family. ”

The two walked to Lin Sha’s side.

“Zou Feifei greeted her with a smile, “Sha Sha! Are you also in this exam room?” ”
