“At this point, Feng Qianhua paused, then, she said, “At the engagement party between your uncle Lin and I Tomorrow, your grandmother Lin invited the Cen family’s old lady. Maybe fifth master Cen will also attend. At that time, you must pay attention to your image and let Old Lady Cen and fifth master Cen see a different young lady from a wealthy family.” ” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Feng Xianxian nodded. “Mom, don’t worry. I know what to do.” ”

“Feng Qianhua continued, “Fifth Master Cen is a vegetarian. You should also pay more attention to the way you dress tomorrow. Remember to wear something simple and elegant!”! One or two jewelry straps that could reveal one’s identity would do. They should not be like those vulgar and vulgar people who wore everything on their bodies. ”

“”Okay,”Feng Xianxian said, “Mom, I even specially ordered a qipao.” ”

Cen Wuye liked wearing a long robe. It was very suitable to stand with him in a qipao.

Feng Qianhua’s eyes were filled with satisfaction.

“Feng Xianxian was good-looking and had a good figure. After wearing the qipao, she would definitely be stunning. ”

“In the blink of an eye, it was the day of the engagement. ”

“Seeing that the downstairs was getting more and more lively, Lin Ze was extremely anxious. Hurry up! He had to hurry up! ”

Lin Jincheng should be back in a while.

“At this moment, a word suddenly popped up on the computer screen. ”

Success!

“He successfully hacked into the database, but unfortunately, there was no information about his mother in the database. ”

Ye Shu.

Female.

39 years old.

“Pregnant with a daughter, this year 19 years old, studying at Beijing University. ”

Name!

Ye Zao!

Ye Zao?

Ye Zao was actually ye Shu’s daughter!

Lin Ze was stunned. What was going on?

“If ye Shu was the mother that he had been looking forward to for so many years, then how did she give birth to him and ye Zao at the same time? ”

“Looking further down, Ye Shu was currently living with her brother, Ye Sen. ”

“Seeing this, Lin Ze was stunned again. ”

“So, Ye Shu and Ye Sen were siblings. ”

“Lin Ze suddenly thought of what ye Sen had said to him. He said that his sister was a single mother. Because she had been cheated, she had given birth to a daughter. All these years, she had raised her daughter alone. ”

“Ye Sen had also used this to comfort Lin ze, telling him not to give up looking for his mother. ”

Lin Ze thought of what fat tiger and the others had said.

Fat Tiger said that ye Zhuo looked very similar to him.

Could it be...

Could it be that he and ye Zao were really brother and sister!

They were twins.

Did he really have a sister?

“Not only did he have a mother, but he also had a sister. ”

“Thinking of this, Lin Ze was so happy that he almost cried. ”

“With the information he had found, he hurried downstairs. ”

“Downstairs, the servants were busy, and more than half of the guests had arrived. Old Mrs. Lin was greeting the guests with a smile on her face. ”

“”Grandpa Butler, Where’s My Dad?”Lin Ze ran to the butler’s side. ”

“The butler said, “I saw him just now. He said that he was going to pick someone up from the Feng family.” ”

The Feng Family?

Lin Ze’s eyebrows jumped. “When did you see my dad?”

“About five minutes ago.”

The Feng family was quite a distance away from the Lin family.

“Five minutes, there was still time! ”

Lin Ze turned around and ran out. He took out his cell phone and made a call. “Fat Tiger! Are the three of You Together Now? Okay! You guys immediately ride your bikes to East City Avenue to stop my dad’s car! The license plate number is Beijing Y6218! I’ll be there right away!”

“”Okay, brother Ze, I got it.” ”

“After fat tiger hung up, dog two asked curiously, “Brother ze called?” ”

“Li Wen said, “Brother Ze’s dad is engaged today. Brother ze must be in a bad mood right now!” ”

Dog two sighed. “He’s really engaged? Then what about our brother Ze?”

Fat Tiger picked up the keys to his bike and handed it to the three of them. “Brother Ze just called and told us to go to East City Avenue to stop his dad’s car! It looks like there’s something urgent! Let’s go quickly!”

“Hearing this, Li Wen straightened his expression. “What’s the license plate number?” ”

“Fat Tiger replied, “Beijing Y6218!” ”

“Dog Two, who had been lying on the sofa, immediately stood up. ”

“The three of them had a life-and-death relationship with Lin Ze. No matter when or where, as long as Lin Ze opened his mouth, they would not hesitate to help Lin Ze! ”

“Not long after, three motorcycles appeared on the highway at lightning speed. They were so fast that only an afterimage could be seen, causing the passing cars to look at each other. ”

“The skills of the three of them were very good. With a rumble, they perfectly avoided every car on the highway. ”

Extremely handsome!

“”Boss, the three cars behind seem to be coming for us.”Secretary Zhang sat in the front passenger seat and turned to look at Lin Jincheng. ”

“Lin Jincheng pressed his temples and said tiredly, “Tell the driver to be careful.” ”

He had just finished his sentence.
