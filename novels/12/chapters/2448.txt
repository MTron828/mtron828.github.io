“”It’s alright.”The assistant smiled and said, “We’re used to it.” ”

“Soon, they arrived at the pharmacy. ” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Doctor Liu took some painkillers and said, “Give this to boss song.” ”

“Okay.”The assistant nodded.

“Doctor Liu then instructed, “By the way, Tell Boss song to pay attention to rest for the next few days. Don’t touch junk food!” ”

“”Okay.”The assistant continued, “Doctor Liu, aren’t you coming back with me?” ”

“Doctor Liu said, “I have other things to do.” ”

“”Okay, then I’ll be leaving first, doctor Liu.” ”

The assistant took the medicine and walked in song Shiyu’s direction.

“Doctor Liu looked at the assistant’s figure, and the curiosity in his eyes was very obvious. ”

He was curious as to why song Shiyu had become like this.

He was also curious as to who had caused song Shiyu to be unable to fall in love with him.

The assistant quickly returned to song Shiyu’s side and handed the medicine to Song Shiyu.

“”Boss, this is Painkiller.” ”

“Song Shiyu reached out to take it, unscrewed the bottle cap, and took two pills. ”

“The assistant continued, “In addition, doctor Liu also instructed you not to eat outside food for the time being. Otherwise, even the painkiller would be useless.” ”

Song Shiyu did not say anything. He just looked up at his assistant. “Pack up all the Food I ate today and bring it back.”

Pack up?

The assistant was stunned.

“”Your hearing is bad?”Seeing that his assistant did not speak for a long time, song Shiyu frowned slightly. ”

“The assistant instantly reacted. “But, but Doctor Liu...” ”

“You want to be doctor Liu’s assistant?”Song Shiyu looked up at his assistant.

“The assistant immediately said, “Okay, I’ll get it ready right away!” ”

Song Shiyu stood up and walked back.

“”Shiyu!”At that moment, a pleasant female voice sounded in the air. ”

Song Shiyu turned around and saw a young woman in a light blue dress.

It was Chen Siyao.

“Why are you here?”Song Shiyu asked.

“Chen Siyao wasn’t angry at song Shiyu’s words. She maintained a faint smile on her face and didn’t hide her emotions. She continued, “I came here specially to look for you.” ”

“What’s the matter?”Song Shiyu asked.

“”Let’s Find a place to talk,”Chen Siyao continued. ”

“Perhaps afraid that song Shiyu would reject her, Chen Siyao continued, “I have something very important to discuss with you.” ”

“Since it was something very important, song Shiyu naturally wouldn’t reject her. He looked down at his watch and asked, “Is half an hour enough?” ”

“It’s enough.”Chen Siyao nodded.

“Let’s go.”Song Shiyu raised his foot and walked forward.

Chen Siyao immediately followed song Shiyu’s footsteps.

Song Shiyu came to a teahouse with few people.

He ordered some snacks and green tea.

“Chen Siyao said in surprise, “Didn’t you used to like drinking black tea?” ”

“”You also said that it was in the past,”song Shiyu said. ”

Chen Siyao nodded. “That’s true. People Change.”

Song Shiyu had changed a lot.

The only thing he hadn’t changed was that he liked her and accepted her.

“With that thought, Chen Siyao’s face was filled with a bitter smile. ”

“Soon, dim sum and green tea were served. ”

“Song Shiyu took a sip of tea and continued, “What did you want to talk to me about?” ”

“Just as he was about to say something, he suddenly heard song Shiyu’s voice. Chen Siyao didn’t know what to say. ”

“After mulling it over for a while, Chen siyao continued, “Let’s get married.” ”

“Although it was only a few words, it had exhausted Chen Siyao’s lifetime of courage. ”

Get Married?

“Upon hearing this, song Shiyu looked at Chen Siyao. ”

There was no expression on his face.

There wasn’t even a look of disgust or surprise.

“Get Married?”Song Shiyu looked at Chen Siyao. “Me and you?”

“”Yes.”Chen siyao nodded and continued, “Marrying me won’t do you any harm.” ”

Song Shiyu took a sip of tea and listened with interest as Chen Siyao continued.

“Chen siyao continued, “People have to get married eventually, and we’re already at the right age for marriage. Shiyu, instead of marrying an unknown woman, you might as well marry me.” ”

“”I don’t mind if you don’t like me, and I don’t mind being a tool. Shiyu, do you understand what I’m saying?” ”

Chen Siyao mustered up a lot of courage to say this.

She wanted to marry song Shiyu.

Her love for Song Shiyu would never change.

“If words had to describe her love for Song Shiyu, it would definitely be the love between a woman and a man in a TV series. ”

“In the TV series, a woman, in order to marry her beloved, knew that there was no result, but she still resolutely married her beloved’s photo. ”
