Translator: 549690339

Master Cao’s words stunned Manxing.

She was silent for a moment.

Because even Manxing herself did not expect things to turn out like this.

“Manjiangshan and Zhao Dan’s plan was to use public opinion to recognize ye Zao back, and then smoothly establish a reasonable relationship with the General Alliance. ”

“Who would have thought that not only did their parents not recognize ye Zao back, but they also dragged themselves into it. ”

And it was a whole ten years. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“This sudden blow, outside of Manxing’s plan, also made it hard for her to accept. ”

“Master Cao patted Manxing’s shoulder, “Xing ‘er, I know you’re worried about Sir and madam, but now is not the time for you to be worried. Those people outside are eyeing you like a tiger watching its prey. If you’re not careful, your position might be snatched away!” ”

“At this moment, man Xing had to be on full alert. He could not afford to make any mistakes. ”

“Speaking up to this point, master Cao paused and continued, “Sir and Madam have lost their power. The only person who can help you now is yourself.” ”

“If Man Jiangshan and Zhao Dan had not been locked up, man Xing would naturally have been able to inherit the throne from man Jiangshan. ”

“But now, man Xing had to fight for it with strength ”

“”Master, I understand everything you said.”Man Xing looked at master Cao. “Don’t worry, I will not let you down. I will not let my parents down.” ”

Master Cao nodded.

He had placed his life’s Hope on man Xing. He wanted man Xing to succeed more than anyone else.

“”Xing ‘er, a teacher for one day is a father for life.”Master Cao continued, “You should know that I expect more from you.” ”

What was Manxing Country?

“According to Manxing’s talent, she should be standing at the top of the s galaxy. ”

“Yes.”Manxing nodded.

She knew Master Cao’s wishes and was very willing to set off in the direction that master Cao hoped for.

“Master Cao looked out of the window. “When you were born, the sky was dyed with seven colors. That was the first time I saw an auspicious omen.”From then on, master Cao knew that Manxing was not an ordinary person. Later on.., man Xing did not disappoint him. ”

“Man Xing only needed to watch a few times to learn. Her peers were still babbling, but she had already mastered a hundred calculations. ”

“Hearing this, man Xing followed master Cao’s line of sight and looked over. “Master, when my eldest sister was born, was there really a strange phenomenon?” ”

“”Yes.”Master Cao nodded. “When the full moon was born, it rained the whole day.” ”

“When it rained, an umbrella was needed. ”

“When the umbrella was homophonic, it meant that it was scattered. ”

What did being scattered mean?

“The family was separated, the People’s hearts were scattered, and they were like a pile of loose sand... ”

“Seeing that the situation was not right, master Cao immediately made a divination. The divination showed that ye Zao was a fierce person, and he was the bane of his parents and siblings. ”

“As expected, since the birth of the full moon, Manxing Kingdom had fallen into all kinds of natural and man-made disasters! ”

“Master Cao continued, “Actually, when you told me that Ye Zao was your eldest sister, I was a little puzzled. How could such a fierce person have the ability to pacify Changyue Kingdom? But madam insisted that she would not mistake her daughter.”In addition, according to the situation at that time.., recognizing ye Zao would indeed be of great help to Manxing, so master Cao did not object. ”

“”So, Ye Zao is not my eldest sister at all,”Manxing said. “My eldest sister died a long time ago. This matter has been going in the wrong direction from the beginning!” ”

“If they had not provoked ye Zao, things would not have become like this. ”

Master Cao nodded.

“During that time, master Cao thought that there was something wrong with his divination. He even doubted his divination skills. According to the results, there was nothing wrong with his divination. ”

Ye Zao was ye Zao.

The full moon was the full moon.

“Even if a jinx coated her with a layer of gold, she could not become an existence that everyone respected. ”

“It was good that the Little Jinx died, so that she would not stay in the world to harm others. ”

“”Xing ‘er, the past is already in the past. As a person, you can only look forward, you can not look back.”Master Cao looked at the full moon, then, he said, “Becoming the president is just the beginning of your success. The road to becoming the king is long and difficult. You must be mentally prepared. The first step must not go wrong.” ”

“If the first step went wrong, the rest of the road would be impossible. ”

“With Manxing’s talent, she would dominate the s galaxy in the future. ”

“Manxing looked at master cao. “Master, I know what you said. What I’m most worried about now is my parents. I can’t really let them suffer ten years in prison.” ”
