“Feng Xianxian thought for a moment. “Mom, shall we go to the Lin family now? I have a feeling that something isn’t right!” ”

Feng Qianhua nodded. “Okay.”

The mother and daughter set off to the Lin family home.

“Grandma!”Feng Xianxian ran to Old Lady Lin like a butterfly.

“Xianxian!”Old Lady Lin was very happy to see Feng Xianxian.

“However, the smile only lasted for a few seconds before Old Lady Lin’s face fell again. She said guiltily, “Xianxian, Grandma has let you down!” ”

“What’s wrong with Grandma?”

“Old Lady Lin continued, “That blind old lady from the Cen family actually can’t see how good you are...”thinking about this matter.., old Lady Lin felt angry. Feng Xianxian was so good and so outstanding, but Old Lady Cen was comparing Feng Xianxian to a nobody! ”

“Feng Qianxian quickly said, “Grandma, please don’t say that about Grandma Cen. Sister Ye Zao is prettier and more outstanding than me. It’s normal for her to like Sister Ye Zao! “Even though I know Fifth Master Cen before Sister Ye Zao, so what? “There’s no such thing as first-come, first-served love!” ”

“At this point, Feng Qianxian paused and continued, “I don’t blame Sister Ye Zao, and I don’t blame Grandma Cen either. If you want to blame someone, blame me for not being fated with Fifth Master Cen! Grandma, Please Don’t blame them!” ”

“The more Feng Xianxian acted like this, the more old Mrs. Cen felt her heart ache. ”

This child was just like her mother. Everything was good except that she was too kind.

“Old Mrs. Cen said that she could forgive Old Mrs. Cen even if she was just a cat or dog. Ye Zhuo had stolen her boyfriend, so she could still forgive ye Zhuo. ”

“It was fine if she forgave them herself, but she also advised herself not to blame them. ”

Sigh!

“In this world, kind people would suffer more! ”

“Old Lady Lin patted Feng Xianxian on the back. “Xianxian, don’t worry, I will definitely help you get justice! When that wild girl comes back from having sex with female Durban, I will let her break up with Shaoqing!” ”

Female Durban’s closed-door education could change a person’s character. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Accepting adversity, not retaliating, not retaliating was the slogan of female Durban. Feng Xianxian was now looking forward to the reborn ye Zao. ”

“At that time, not to mention breaking up with Cen Shaoqing, even if ye Zhuo were to go east, she would not dare to go west! ”

“Feng Qianqian very well concealed the pride in her heart and continued, “Grandma, what you’re doing is too unfair to sister Ye Zhuo...” ”

“”That wild girl snatched Shaoqing away from you and that’s Fair?”Old Lady Lin said angrily, “Shaoqing should have been yours to begin with! It’s only right for her to return it to you! She owes you this!” ”

“Feng Xianxian was touched as she hugged Old Lady Lin. Her eyes were red as she said, “Grandma, you’re So Good to me...” ”

“Silly child.”Old Lady Lin was also touched beyond words.

...

Female Durban was located in the suburbs of the capital.

It was in the middle of nowhere.

“There was only one building in the surroundings. There were a total of eight vicious dogs in the courtyard. There were posters posted everywhere with slogans such as ‘don’t fight back, don’t scold back, don’t submit, never divorce’, ‘obey your father at home, marry your husband’and so on. ”

It was as if a woman’s dignity was being rubbed on the ground.

“Passing by a classroom, ye Zhuo looked inside through the window. ”

“A middle-aged woman wearing a modified version of the Cheongsam stood in front of the blackboard, she pointed at the words on the blackboard and said, “If the husband is angry, don’t be angry, step back and give in, and keep your voice low! This is a warning to us women to put our husbands above everything else, and never do anything that goes against women’s morals and shamelessness...” ”

“Below the stage, there were women in their 19s and 30s. ”

“All of them listened very seriously and did not forget to take notes. Among so many people, not a single one of them came out to refute. ”

Ye Zhuo frowned slightly. He felt that his worldview was about to explode.

Mr. Zhang turned to look at Ye Zhuo. “What are you looking at! Hurry up and follow!”

Ye Zhuo retracted his gaze.

“Soon, Mr. Zhang brought ye Zhuo to an office and stopped in front of it. He knocked on the door. “Sun Shu, are you in there?” ”

“Mr. Zhang.”

“A middle-aged woman in her forties walked out. She had a medium build and was about 1.6 meters tall. Like all the staff here, she wore a long black qipao and looked very serious. ”

She looked like an old witch from a fairy tale. Walking out of the room would scare a child to tears.

“Mr. Zhang continued, “This is the new student, Ye Zhuo. Take her to the dormitory later and teach her our rules! I still have other things to do.” ”

Ye Zhuo?

A glimmer flashed across Sun Shu’s originally calm eyes.

Could this be the ye Zhuo that Feng Qianhua had asked her to take special care of.
