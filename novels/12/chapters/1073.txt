“When he said that, the surrounding people burst into laughter. ”

Diamond Freedom?

How could that be possible!

“The conditions on Neptune were harsh. Even if ye Zao had designed the speed of light, the aircraft carrier would not be able to land on Neptune smoothly! ” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Yu Zifei wanted to say something else.

Old Nie’s face was cold. “Zifei! Come Back!”

Yu Zifei walked over unwillingly. “Teacher! He...”

Old Nie interrupted Yu Zifei. “Don’t embarrass me here! Follow Me!”

Embarrass me?

Yu Zifei’s heart was filled with blood and he felt very uncomfortable.

How could he be called embarrassed?

“”Teacher! You’re mistaken! They were slandering miss ye just now, so i...” ”

Old Nie sighed. “What they said is right.”

“Teacher?”Yu Zifei looked at old nie in surprise.

“Old Nie continued, “Miss Ye’s aircraft carrier project was originally a dream. I was also old and muddle-headed, so I decided to join her research group!” ”

“Yu Zifei did not expect his teacher to suddenly become like this. “Teacher, you’re one of Miss Ye’s research group members. How can you say that about Miss Ye! You should believe in Miss Ye!” ”

Old Nie sighed and did not say another word.

“At this moment, footsteps suddenly sounded behind him. ”

“Nie Gong.”

Old Nie turned around and saw Tang Xue. “Miss Tang.”

“Tang Xue smiled and said, “Nie Gong, what’s wrong with you? Why are you frowning?” ”

“Nothing.”He had chosen to join Ye Zhuo’s research team back then. It was too late for him to say anything now! He could only bite the bullet!

“Tang Xue seemed to have seen through old NIE’s worries. “Nie Gong, you’re worried about Miss Ye’s aircraft carrier plan, right?” ”

“Hearing this, old nie felt a little embarrassed. Back then, Tang Xue had visited the cottage three times and wanted to invite him to join her laboratory. However, his head had been kicked by a donkey and he had directly rejected Tang Xue! ”

There was no use regretting it now!

“If he had known earlier, he wouldn’t have rejected Tang Xue no matter what. ”

“Tang Xue continued, “Nie Gong, actually, I knew long ago that there was a loophole in the aircraft carrier plan. After all, Miss Ye’s age was obvious. Even if she had the ability to build an aircraft carrier, she also lacked actual combat experience. Talking about war on paper is ultimately empty. That’s why I had to visit the cottage three times!” ”

“When old nie heard this, his face alternated between green and white. He didn’t know what to say. ”

“Tang Xue looked at old nie and said, “Nie Gong, if you regret now, the door of our Tang family’s laboratory will always be open to you!” ”

“When he heard this, old Nie’s eyes lit up. “Miss Tang! Are you serious?” ”

“Tang Xue smiled and said, “Of course I’m serious! Do you think I would lie to You? As long as you’re willing to come back, we welcome you at any time!” ”

“Old Nie said somewhat embarrassedly, “Miss Tang, do you not mind at all that I treated you in the past?” ”

“”What’s there to mind!”Tang Xue continued, “Everyone makes mistakes. Moreover, none of us are Saints!” ”

“Miss Tang! Thank you!”Old Nie was ashamed. “Thank you for not bothering with me!”

“”It’s nothing,”Tang Xue smiled and said, “Nie Gong, if you’ve thought it through, just contact me. I have something to do, so I’ll leave first.” ”

“”Take care, Miss Tang.”Looking at Tang Xue’s back, the dark cloud in old Nie’s heart finally dissipated. ”

“Yu Zifei frowned slightly. “Teacher, you’re not really going to quit Miss Ye’s research group, are you?” ”

“Old Nie nodded, “I was originally worried that Miss Tang would hold a grudge against me for rejecting her before. Now that Miss Tang isn’t willing to hold a grudge against me, why shouldn’t I go back?”Old Nie wasn’t the kind of person who wouldn’t turn back until he hit a wall. ”

“”Teacher! How can you do this?”Yu Zifei frowned. “Now that Miss Ye’s aircraft carrier project has begun, if you withdraw now, who will fill your vacancy?” ”

“Old Nie patted Yu Zifei’s shoulder. “Zifei, you’re still young. Some things can not be done with a passion. When you reach my age, you’ll understand my current mood!”Old Nie was already in his fifties, he had practically dedicated his life to the Cen family’s base. He wanted to do something when he retired! ”

He didn’t want to be ridiculed by others by following ye Zhuo!

“After entering Tang Xue’s laboratory and retiring, he would receive a sky-high pension. ”

“Following ye Zhuo, not only would he not receive any pension, he would also be ridiculed by others! ”
