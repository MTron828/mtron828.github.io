“”Fengyu is right,”Mrs. Duanmu continued, “Sister, they say that time is cruel, but it hasn’t left anything on you. You are still the same as you were when you were young!” ”

Duanmu Fengyu and Duanmu Fenfei were both born beauties.

Each age had its own beauty.

This kind of beauty could not be seen from others.

“Otherwise, the Duanmu family’s young lady would not have become the Chief Alliance’s wife. ”

“Moreover, the Duanmu family had always had a very magical thing. ”

“If the Duanmu family’s daughter-in-law was pregnant, they would definitely have twins. ”

A son and a daughter.

Duanmu Feng and her brother went to military school.

Duanmu Huang Fei sighed softly. “What’s the use of being good-looking? It’s just skin.”

She was indeed pretty.

“However, Cen Haifeng’s mind was not on her. ”

“Sometimes, she would ask herself. ”

What was so good about being the wife of the Chief Alliance?

“She seemed to be in a glorious position, but in fact, she was well aware of all the hardships and sufferings. ”

“In fact, Cen Haifeng was fine when he first came back. ”

Later on.

Cen Haifeng refused to share a room with her and refused to talk to her...

“Until now, Cen Haifeng had actually proposed to bring all those people back from Earth. ”

Where did this leave her?

It was simply ridiculous!

“Mrs. Duanmu saw Duanmu Huangfei’s distress and continued, “Brother-in-law hasn’t returned yet?” ”

“Not yet.”Duanmu huangfei shook her head.

“Mrs. Duanmu continued, “Then let’s Go in and talk?” ”

“Okay.”Duanmu huangfei nodded.

The three of them walked inside.

In the inner room.

“Mrs. Duanmu put down the curtain and looked at Duanmu Huangfei. “Sister, what is brother-in-law thinking? He can’t keep running away from you.” ”

“”He’s not running away from me. He’s going to find a way to lift the ban,”Duanmu Huangfei said. ”

Mrs. Duanmu was stunned. “Does that mean brother-in-law already knows?”

“Duanmu Huang Fei sighed. “Although he doesn’t know all of it, he probably knows most of it.” ”

“After saying that, Duanmu Huang Fei continued, “This is all my fault! I brought this upon myself! I Don’t blame him for feeling sorry for him just because he has a headache! If it weren’t for my unnecessary actions, he would never have thought of all this! It’s all my fault!” ”

“Even now, Duanmu Huang Fei still blamed herself very much. ”

“If she wasn’t soft-hearted, how could all these things have happened? ”

It was her fault.

It was all her fault!

“Mrs. Duanmu narrowed her eyes. “So, brother-in-law still doesn’t know that those people on Earth are his wife and children?” ”

“Duanmu huangfei nodded, “I told him that those people on Earth were his brother’s widows and sons. “But this can only be hidden for a while, how can it be hidden forever? “Once he brings those people back, how could he not know? “Do you know how regretful I am right now?” ” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“”Sister, since it has already happened, there’s no use regretting it,”Mrs. Duanmu continued, “What we need to do now is to look forward and move forward to think of a way to resolve this matter.” ”

Now was not the time to blame and regret.

“After saying that, Mrs. Duanmu continued, “Brother-in-law hasn’t discovered anything yet, which means that he hasn’t completely deactivated the chip in his body. By the way, does the great elder and the Imperial preceptor know about this?” ”

“”They don’t.”Duanmu huangfei continued, “I haven’t told them yet.” ”

“”Sister, you’re really too muddle-headed!”Mrs. Duanmu frowned. “How can you not tell the Great Elder and the Imperial preceptor about this!” ”

Duanmu huangfei also had his own difficulties.

“After all, this matter was caused by her mistake. ”

“Mrs. Duanmu continued, “Sister, we have to tell the National Master and the great elder about this matter and ask them to think of a way. Don’t worry, things have already developed to this stage. Moreover, you didn’t do it on purpose. I believe that they will not blame you.” ”

“”Aunt, I say that mother is right,”Duanmu Fengyu continued, “Now is not the time to pursue the responsibility. We have to think of a way to stop uncle. Otherwise, when uncle really lifts the ban, everything will be too late!” ”

“When the General Alliance was brought back to the General Alliance, they would be sealed by the ancient ban left behind by the General Alliance. ”

“Under normal circumstances, they would not have their memories sealed by the prohibition until they died. ”

The reason why CEN Haifeng remembered the fragments and knew that he came from Earth was because he could not bear the pain caused by the prohibition. That was why Duanmu Huangfei had removed a bit of it for him.
