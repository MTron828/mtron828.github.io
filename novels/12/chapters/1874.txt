“As soon as this photo was posted, the group started discussing it. ”

Everyone was extremely envious of Mother Xu.

Mother Xu looked at the replies in the group and her eyes were filled with smiles. Her vanity was instantly satisfied.

“At this moment, the sound of footsteps could be heard in the air. ”

It was Xu Yao going downstairs!

“Thinking of this, mother Xu immediately put away her phone and turned around to walk out of the door. ”

“Just as she walked out of the door, she saw Xu Yao, who was dressed neatly and walking down. ”

“Yaoyao.”

“Mom.”Xu Yao walked over.

“Mother Xu pulled Xu Yao’s hands and looked them up and down before saying, “My daughter is really beautiful!” ”

“Xu Yao was 165 centimeters tall and had a curvy front and back. Her facial features were very good and her eyes were round and big. Although her eyelids had been cut, because of her good recovery and the cover of her makeup, nothing could be seen. ”

“Xu Yao smiled and said, “Thank God mom gave birth to me well.” ”

“”By the way, have you thought about that?”Mother Xu asked ”

“What?”Xu Yao was stunned.

Mother Xu whispered into Xu Yao’s ear.

“Xu Yao blushed and said, “It depends.” ”

“”This is not a matter that depends on the situation,”mother xu said very seriously, “You have to seize the opportunity!” ”

It was now or never.

“Okay.”Xu Yao nodded.

“”Okay, go quickly.”Mother Xu patted Xu Yao’s hand. “Don’t make he ziteng wait so anxiously.” ”

“”Then I’ll leave first, Mom.” ”

“”Go.”Mother Xu watched Xu Yao walk downstairs, then to the balcony. ”

Xu Yao jogged all the way to the door. “I’m sorry to have kept you waiting for so long.”

“”It’s okay.”He Ziteng put away his phone. “Isn’t it normal for men to wait for women? By the way, Happy Birthday!” ”

“After saying that, he ziteng opened the door of the passenger seat and took out a bunch of bright red roses and handed them to Xu Yao. ”

There were a total of 51 roses.

The implication: I only have you in my heart.

Xu Yao’s lips curled up without a trace. She took the red roses from he ziteng with both hands. “Thank you.”

“Seeing Xu Yao accept his flowers, he ziteng was a little excited. ”

He thought Xu Yao would reject him!

“”It’s my honor to be able to accept these flowers,”he ziteng said. ”

Xu Yao lowered her head and sniffed the flowers. “It’s also my honor to be able to receive the flowers you sent.”

He ziteng suppressed the excitement in his heart and opened the car door. “Get in first.”

“Okay.”Xu Yao carried the red rose and got into the car.

“He ziteng was quite excited along the way, and his heart was beating fast. ”

“About half an hour later, the car stopped at the entrance of a high-end Western restaurant. ”

The waiter walked forward and opened the car door.

The two of them got out of the car and walked into the restaurant.

Xu Yao had been to this restaurant a few times before.

“In her memory, every time she came, there would be a full house, but today, she didn’t see a single guest. ”

This was a little unusual.

Could it be...

That he ziteng booked this place?

Yes.

That must be the case.

It seemed that he ziteng was preparing to confess his love today.

Xu Yao narrowed her eyes. Her eyes were full of pride. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

The two of them went to the best seat on the top floor.

He ziteng handed the menu to Xu Yao.

Xu Yao ordered two dishes and returned the menu to he ziteng.

“The environment of the Western restaurant was very good. Sitting by the window on the top floor, not only could they enjoy the most beautiful scenery in the entire capital, but they could also listen to beautiful music. ”

“Although Xu Yao had been to this western restaurant to eat, she had never been to the top floor, and she had never ordered a top-tier set meal. ”

“He ziteng opened a bottle of’82 Lafite and poured a glass for Xu Yao personally. “Yaoyao, Happy Birthday.” ”

“Thank you.”Xu Yao raised her glass.

“Halfway through the meal, he ziteng suddenly put down his knife and fork and said, “Yaoyao, I’m going to the bathroom.” ”

“Okay.”Xu Yao nodded.

He ziteng stood up and walked in the direction of the bathroom.

“Xu Yao looked at He Ziteng’s back and smiled. Then, she took out her phone and took a picture of the dining table in front of her. Then, she took a picture of the scenery outside the window and sent it to her moments. ”

“Almost as soon as she sent it, she received a lot of comments and likes. ”

Xu Yao replied to the comments one by one.

“Not long after, he ziteng came back. Xu Yao put down her phone and said hello to he ziteng. Then, she turned her head to enjoy the scenery outside the window. ”

“He ziteng asked, “Aren’t you going to eat?” ”

Xu Yao shook her head. “I’m full.”

“You have such a small appetite?”He ziteng asked.

“Xu Yao smiled and said, “To be honest, I prefer spicy rice noodles to red wine and steak.” ”
