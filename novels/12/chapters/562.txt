“Feng Qianhua revealed a smile. “Fourth sister-in-law, what are you talking about? What Secret? Why Can’t I Understand?””

Zhao shuning naturally knew what Feng Qianhua meant. His eyes were filled with gratitude.

“Feng Qianhua was the first person to know this secret, but she did not use it to threaten her.”

“Therefore, no matter what happened, Zhao shuning would always stand on Feng Qianhua’s side.”

Because Feng Qianhua was worth it!

“Qianhua!”Zhao shuning hugged Feng Qianhua without saying anything.

“From an angle that Zhao shuning couldn’t see, the corners of Feng Qianhua’s lips curled up.”

To Feng Qianhua.

Zhao shuning was the ‘knife’that was used to kill people.

“Zhao shuning looked smart, but she was actually very stupid.”

“If she wanted Zhao shuning to work for her willingly, she had to influence Zhao shuning. If she used ‘threats’, it would backfire.”

“After Feng Qianhua’s emotions gradually stabilized, the two of them went to Old Lady Lin’s bedroom.”

“Feng Xianxian would make Old Lady Mo Happy. At this moment, the room was filled with Old Lady Lin’s laughter.”

“”Mom, fourth aunt, you’re back.”Feng Xianxian smiled and asked, “Are the Roses in the garden looking good?””

“Yes.”Feng Qianhua nodded.

“Old Mrs. Lin looked up at Feng Qianhua and asked curiously, “Qianhua, why are Your Eyes Red?””

“Feng Qianhua subconsciously rubbed her eyes and said with a smile, “They’re not red! Aunt Lin, you’re mistaken!””

“”Mom, are you crying?”Feng Qianxian was making a big deal out of nothing.”

“No!”Feng Qianhua turned her head.

Crying?

Old Madam Lin was extremely nervous when she heard that.

“What’s wrong with Qianhua? Who bullied you?”

“Feng Qianhua smiled and said, “Aunt Lin, no one bullied me. I’m Fine! I’m really fine. Don’t listen to Xianxian’s nonsense!””

“Zhao shuning couldn’t take it anymore and stood up for Feng Qianhua. “Other than that Vixen, who else can bully Qianhua?””

Vixen?

Old Lady Lin immediately thought of ye Shu. “It’s Ye Shu?”

“”Yes.”Zhao shuning nodded, then, she said, “Mom, you don’t know how much that Vixen has gone overboard! She’s only spouting nonsense because she’s blind in Jin City! It’s also because Qianhua has a good temper and isn’t willing to lower herself to her level! Mom, you must get justice for Qianhua!””

“She’s rebelling! She’s rebelling!”Old Madam Lin was so angry that she coughed. “That B * Tch ye Shu! Does she really think that an old woman like me has died in bed?”

She actually dared to bully Feng Qianhua right under her nose!

She’s really too B * Tch!

“A glimmer of light flashed across Feng Qianhua’s eyes and disappeared in a flash. “Aunt Lin, don’t blame sister Ye Shu. She didn’t do it on purpose. Moreover, I’m also at fault in this matter! It’s only right for me to apologize to her!””

Apologize?

Old Madam Lin stared at Feng Qianhua with wide eyes. “That Vixen still dares to make you apologize to her?”

Zhao shuning added fuel to the fire. “It’s not just an apology! That Vixen ye Shu even insulted Qianhua for not knowing shame!”

Not knowing shame?

How would she dare?

Old Madam Lin was furious to the extreme. She wished she could slap ye Shu to death.

B * Tch!

“Zhao shuning continued, “Mom, that Vixen did it on purpose! She knew that you loved Qianhua so much and treated Qianhua like your own daughter, but she still treated Qianhua like that! Isn’t that slapping your face?””

“Speaking up to this point, Zhao shuning sighed, “Mom, Jin city is such a good person. How could they meet a woman like ye Shu? If Jin city had married Qianhua back then, how could such a thing have happened?””

PA —

“Old Madam Lin slammed the table and stood up. “Ye Shu, that B * Tch! I’m not done with her!” Then, she looked down at Feng Qianhua and comforted her. “Qianhua, don’t worry. I’ll definitely help you get justice! As long as I’m around in this family, no one can bully you!””

“Feng Qianhua walked to Old Madam Lin’s side and held her arm, she said gently, “Aunt Lin, I’m really fine! Don’t let this affect your relationship with sister ye Shu, and don’t let these small matters affect the harmony of the family!””

“Old Lady Lin turned to look at Feng Qianhua, her eyes full of gratitude.”

Feng Qianhua was still the best.

Feng Qianhua was understanding.

What about ye Shu? FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

She was simply an unruly person!

No wonder there was an old saying that unruly people came out of the mountains and rivers!

“The More Old Lady Lin thought about it, the angrier she got!”

“Feng Qianhua then comforted her, “Aunt Lin, I’ve never asked you for anything before. This time, I’m begging you, okay? Please don’t go and find trouble with sister Ye Shu. I’m really fine! I don’t want brother Jin Cheng to have any estrangement between me and sister Ye Shu.””
