“An Lizi sighed. “Qingqing, I really didn’t ask about this!” ”

“Zhang Qingqing smiled and said, “That’s Easy! Just ask where Buttface’s family lives!” ”

Rich second generation children definitely lived in areas where every inch of land was worth a fortune.

“Therefore, knowing where Buttface lived allowed them to know his family background. ”

“Who should I ASK?”An Lizi didn’t want to ask.

It wasn’t good to pry into other people’s privacy this time.

“You should ask your cousin!”Zhang Qingqing felt that an Lizi was a little silly. “Is there anything between you and your cousin that you’re embarrassed to say?”

An Lizi sighed.

“Zhang Qingqing continued, “Lizi, quickly go and ask. I’m waiting for your reply!” ”

“”I. . .”An Lizi was still a little hesitant. Zhang Qingqing couldn’t be bothered to waste her breath on an Lizi. She directly said, “It’s settled then. Go and ask right now. I’m hanging up now.” ”

“An Lizi looked at the phone that was hung up, her face full of worry. ”

Could it be that she really had to ask Lin Ze?

“At this moment, Zhang Qingqing sent a wechat message. [ did you ask? ] ”

An Lizi replied: [ not yet. ]

[ hurry up and ask! ! ! ]

An Lizi had no choice but to open Lin Ze’s wechat. [ is Ah Ze around? ]

“Lin Ze did not reply immediately. After a long while, Lin Ze replied: [ yes. ] ”

“An Lizi continued typing. ‘Ah Ze, where does your friend Buttface Live?’ ”

“After thinking for a while, an Lizi felt that it was not appropriate to ask such a question. She deleted all the words and edited them again. ”

“After repeatedly deleting them several times, she finally edited a sentence, [ AH ZE, let me ask you a question. ] ”

[ Okay. ]

[ where does buttface live? ] An Lizi made up her mind and directly sent this sentence over.

“No matter how she asked, she couldn’t get away from this central point. ” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“On the other side, Lin Ze was stunned. ”

Why would an lizi ask this out of the blue?

“Lin Ze quickly opened Buttface’s chat box and saw that two hours ago, buttface had sent him a wechat message asking an lizi what type of boy she liked. ”

Could it be...

That the two of them were interested in each other?

“Lin Ze couldn’t understand what the two were thinking, so he replied to an lizi first, [ his family lives in Shengshi Hailan District. ] ”

“[ okay, got it. ] ”

“After receiving Lin Ze’s reply, an Lizi immediately replied to Zhang Qingqing, [ got it for you. ] ”

“Seeing this, Zhang Qingqing couldn’t wait to reply, [ where do you live? ] ”

“An Lizi replied, [ Shengshi Hailan District. ] ”

Shengshi Hailan?

Zhang Qingqing narrowed her eyes. How come she had never heard of the name of this district?

Zhang Qingqing immediately switched to the search page and searched for the name of this community.

Shengshi Hailan.

“It was a very ordinary community. In the Imperial City, which was full of dignitaries, this community could only be considered mid-to high-end. Many white-collar workers liked this community, but unfortunately, it was completely different from a wealthy family. ”

“Not to mention a wealthy family, it couldn’t even be considered an ordinary wealthy family. ”

“Seeing this, Zhang Qingqing was very disappointed. She had thought that dog two was a low-key rich second generation, but she didn’t expect that dog two was a poor loser. ”

She didn’t care what she wanted.

“Thinking that dog two had added his wechat, Zhang Qingqing was a little angry. ”

A poor loser was also worthy of adding her wechat!

Zhang Qingqing was angry and disappointed at the same time. She sighed deeply.

Could it be that she wasn’t destined to marry into a rich family?

No.

She had to marry into a rich family and change her fate!

Yes.

She couldn’t accept her fate.

Xia Xiaoman could marry into a rich family with a burden and even turn an lizi into a rich daughter. Why couldn’t she?

Buttface wasn’t a rich second generation. There were others!

“Although Lin Ze had a girlfriend now, who knew what would happen tomorrow? ”

Maybe Lin Ze would break up with his girlfriend Tomorrow!

She could cultivate a relationship with Lin Ze in advance and wait for him.

“Moreover, with an Lizi as a godly assistant, she would definitely be able to win Lin ze over. ”

“Thinking of this, Zhang Qingqing sent a wechat message to an Lizi. [ Lizi, help me find out how your cousin’s relationship with his girlfriend is. ] ”

“An Lizi was a little speechless. Looking at the wechat message from Zhang Qingqing, she didn’t want to bother with her anymore. ”

“But very soon, Zhang Qingqing sent another wechat message, like a serial killer. ”

An Lizi had to pick up her phone to reply her. [ ah ze has a very good relationship with his girlfriend. ]

“Seeing this message, Zhang Qingqing wanted to smash her phone. ”

“If Lin Ze’s relationship with his girlfriend was average, she could still wait. But Lin Ze had a good relationship with his girlfriend. How could she wait? ”
