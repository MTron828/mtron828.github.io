Gu dening looked up and saw a handsome face. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

This was...

Ye Sen.

“At this moment, gu dening felt that her breathing was a little irregular.”

Her heartbeat also inexplicably accelerated.

“Ye...”gu dening was about to speak when ye Sen raised his hand to cover her mouth.

“Ye Sen looked down at Wei Liping. “You, apologize to my girlfriend!””

Wei Liping was dumbfounded.

Didn’t they say that Gu Dening was single?

Why did she suddenly have a boyfriend?

“Apologize!”

“Seeing that Wei Liping did not speak, Ye Sen walked directly to Wei Ping.”

“Ye Sen was 1.85 meters tall, more than a head taller than Wei Liping. Under pressure, Wei Liping took a few steps back, picked up his phone on the table, and turned to run.”

Ye Sen curled his lips.

“Gu dening finally reacted and walked to Ye Sen’s side. “Mr. Ye, thank you for just now.””

“Ye Sen smiled and said, “I should be the one apologizing to you. Pretending to be your boyfriend without your consent.””

“Thinking of the experience just now, Gu Dening’s ears were a little red. “No matter what, I still have to thank you. If it weren’t for you, I really don’t know how I would have dealt with him.””

“”It’s a piece of cake,”ye Sen continued, “Were you on a blind date just now?””

Gu dening nodded.

“Ye Sen teased, “Who introduced you? You’re too careless. Why do you have to introduce everyone to you?””

“At the mention of this, Gu Dening was a little distressed. “It was my aunt who introduced me. The person just now was a high school student of my aunt’s husband. I heard that he’s always been a good student with excellent character. I didn’t expect it to turn out like this...””

“If she had known this would happen, she definitely wouldn’t have agreed to meet him.”

Ye Sen nodded. “So it was a family relative who introduced him. No wonder I couldn’t refuse.”

“GU dening continued, “By the way, Mr. Ye, when did you return to Yunjing?””

“”We came back yesterday,”ye Sen answered.”

“”OH.”GU dening continued, “Did miss ye come back with us?””

“”Yes, we all came back together.”Ye Sen nodded.”

“After that, Ye Sen looked at gu dening and asked, “Shall we go out for a walk?””

“Okay.”Gu dening nodded.

The two of them walked out of the cafe together.

“Gu Dening’s heart was in a mess. When she was crossing the road, she didn’t notice that there was a car on the road and directly crossed it.”

“At this moment, Ye Sen grabbed her wrist and pulled her back. “Be careful! Are You Okay?””

“Gu dening was also scared out of her wits. In a split second, she almost brushed past the car.”

Almost.

“”I’m, I’m fine.”Gu Dening’s face was a little pale.”

“Ye Sen smiled and said, “It seems that the blind date incident has hit you hard.””

Gu dening smiled embarrassedly.

“At this moment, Ye Sen saw a movie theater promoting a new movie and said, “Miss Gu, Why don’t we watch a movie to relax?””

“Okay.”Gu dening nodded.

The two of them walked to the movie theater together.

“Ye Sen was standing beside Gu Dening. As long as gu dening looked up, she could see the side of his face.”

Bang Bang Bang —

Her heart seemed to beat faster.

“Because she was too nervous, gu dening didn’t even see what movie ticket ye Sen had bought. It wasn’t until she entered the theater that Gu Dening realized that this was a super scary ghost movie.”

“Although gu dening was a doctor and knew that there were no ghosts in this world, she was most afraid of this kind of ghost movie. Before it even started, her body was already covered in cold sweat. She was extremely afraid.”

“Are You Afraid?”Ye Sen tilted his head and looked at Gu Dening.

“Gu dening shook her head and tried hard to calm herself down. “No, I’m not afraid.””

“Ye Sen smiled and said, “These are all fake. You Don’t have to be afraid. Besides, I’m sitting next to you.”At this point, Ye Sen handed his arm to Gu Dening, “If you’re afraid, you can pinch me. Don’t worry, I’m not afraid of Pain!””

“Gu dening really admired ye Sen. The big screen was playing such a horrifying scene, but he didn’t care at all. He could even talk to her with a smile.”

Was he not afraid at all?

“Because of the working environment, gu dening seldom got along with men her age. The men around her were either fathers or grandfathers. This was the first time she sat with the opposite sex to watch a movie.”

“”Thank you, thank you,”gu decing thanked him.”

“You’re welcome.”

“After the movie, Ye Sen and Gu decing went to have a meal together. After the meal, Ye Sen drove Gu decing to her house and then went home.”

“On the way home, Ye Sen was in a good mood and even whistled.”

“Until he got home, Ye Sen was still whistling and lying on the sofa with his legs crossed.”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Uncle, what happened to you? Why Are You So Happy?””

Ye Sen turned to look at Ye Zao. “It’s a secret for now.”

“Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly. “Looking at you, did you find me an aunt?””

“”No, don’t guess blindly.”Ye Sen immediately stood up from the sofa. “I’m going to take a shower first.””

Ye Zao looked at Ye Sen’s back and felt that this matter was not simple. He could not help but worry about Ye Sen’s taste.

After all...

Ye Sen had already been deceived twice.

“However, ye Zao did not intend to interfere in this matter. No matter what, this was Ye Sen’s privacy.”

“On the 14th day of the first lunar month, the family of four set off for the capital.”

“Because ye Sen still had matters to deal with, he stayed in cloud capital and returned to the capital a few days later.”

...

On the other side.

In the capital.

Lin Qingxuan had been a little annoyed these few days. He had promised Xia Xiaoman that he would settle their matters after the new year and give her an explanation.

“However, Old Lady Lin had not relented. Not only did she not relent, but Old Lady Lin had also invited many young ladies in their twenties to visit the Lin family, causing Lin Qingxuan to feel extremely awkward.”

“After they left, Lin Qingxuan went to look for Old Lady Lin. “Mom, can you not be like this? I’ve already told you that I won’t marry anyone other than Xiaoman.””

“Old Lady Lin’s face was stern. “That Xia Xiaoman is already forty-one years old, and she still has a burden on her shoulders. Just what is so good about her?””

Which of those twenty-something-year-old girls was not better than Xia Xiaoman?

Old Lady Lin thought that Lin Qingxuan would be able to see the truth after seeing these girls again. She did not expect him to be so stubborn.

“”She is good in every way,”Lin Qingxuan continued, “Also, Lizi is not a burden. She is a very sensible and good child. I have already treated Lizi as my own daughter.””

“Old Mrs. Lin looked at Lin Qingxuan. “Fourth brother, why do you have to go against me?””

“”Mom, I’m not going against you. I really like Xiaoman. For the rest of my life, I just want to live with her.””

“Old Mrs. Lin slammed the table angrily. “You can only choose between Xia Xiaoman and me! There’s no me, no her, no me! You Choose!””
