Translator: 549690339

Song Shiyu didn’t say anything. He just took a sip of tea.

“Bai Jiayu looked at song Shiyu. “Actually, I’m quite curious. Who is the person in your heart?” ”

Was It Ye Zhuo?

“After all, Ye Zhuo was the only woman who came into contact with song Shiyu. ”

“Most importantly, the little girl song Shiyu met in his childhood was Ye Zhuo. ”

“Although song Shiyu had never admitted it openly, Bai Jiayu could feel that the little girl was ye Zhuo. ”

“In fact, Bai Jiayu had always had this answer in his heart, but he didn’t dare to say it out loud. ”

“Song Shiyu smiled at Bai Jiayu and continued, “If I say it out loud, won’t I be someone that’s buried in the bottom of My Heart?” ”

True Love wasn’t something that everyone knew.

Everyone knew that it was a burden.

Bai Jiayu looked at song Shiyu. “Then are you just going to keep it buried deep in your heart?”

“What else?”Song Shiyu asked back.

“Bai Jiayu said, “Of course I said it out loud! Isn’t there a saying? Love must be said out loud! If you keep it buried deep in your heart, she will never know, and neither will you two!” ”

“”There doesn’t need to be a result,”song Shiyu’s tone was indifferent. ”

He only needed to know his own feelings.

“Bai Jiayu looked at song Shiyu with a look of disbelief in his eyes. “Third brother, when did you become a love-struck fool?” ”

Song Shiyu had always been decisive and decisive. He had never shown such an expression. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Love-struck Fool?”Song Shiyu turned to look at Bai Jiayu.

“Bai Jiayu nodded. “That’s right. It’s infatuated seed. If someone like you isn’t infatuated seed, then what is?” ”

Song Shiyu chuckled but didn’t say anything.

“Bai Jiayu continued, “Third brother, you can’t do this!” ”

“Huh?”

“Bai Jiayu said, “Girls are very emotional. You have to move them with your actions. You’ll always be the 10,000-year-old second male lead in novels! Do you understand second male lead?” ”

“Before this, Bai Jiayu had never thought that song Shiyu would one day become like this. ”

The third master of Song in Yun Jing was stubborn and cold-blooded. He would do anything to achieve his goal.

“But now, for a girl, he was actually so lowly! ”

“A child is not a fish. How would you know the happiness of a fish?”Song Shiyu’s tone was indifferent.

“Bai Jiayu was a little speechless and said, “I think you are a silly fish!” ”

Song Shiyu didn’t say anything else and took a sip of tea.

Bai Jiayu shook his head helplessly.

Love was really a harmful thing!

“Why don’t you ever confess? Is it because she already has someone she likes?”Bai Jiayu continued to ask.

“”Yes.”This time, Song Shiyu didn’t deny it and directly nodded. ”

“Bai Jiayu continued, “Are you scared here? You can still get a divorce after getting married! Go chase after her! I support you!” ”

Song Shiyu took another sip of tea.

“Why aren’t you saying anything?”Bai Jiayu asked.

“Song Shiyu said, “I was born in the Abyss. I Can’t pull her into the Abyss again.” ”

“He was an existence of extreme darkness, and she was indeed an existence of extreme purity. ”

They were not from the same world to begin with.

“”Third brother, this is not like you!”Bai Jiayu looked at song Shiyu, his eyes filled with disbelief. ”

“Song Shiyu smiled, but didn’t reply. Instead, he said, “If the Chen family comes looking for you again in the next few days, don’t bother with them.” ”

“”En.”Bai Jiayu nodded. “Third brother, will you still get married?” ”

“”No,”song Shiyu answered directly. ”

“Why?”Bai Jiayu asked.

“Song Shiyu slowly said, “Because my family doesn’t have a throne to inherit.” ”

The love of compromise was only for the sake of procreation.

This was meaningless!

“Bai Jiayu smiled and said, “Third brother, be more serious! I’m not joking with you!” ”

“Yes.”Song Shiyu nodded. “I’m not joking with you either.”

“”No Way, third brother? You Don’t even want a child anymore?”Bai Jiayu couldn’t understand. ”

“Life was so long to begin with. It wasn’t easy to live once, so he had to leave a descendant for himself. ”

“Song Shiyu did not say anything. In a moment, he took out a big white rabbit from his pocket and peeled it open to eat. ”

It was very sweet and also very greasy.

“At this moment, the sound of footsteps suddenly came from outside the door. ”

“Bai Jiayu looked up and saw that it was doctor Liu, who was carrying a medical kit. ”

“”Boss song, Mr. Bai is here too,”doctor Liu took the initiative to speak. ”

“Bai Jiayu nodded. “Long time no see, doctor Liu.” ”

“Doctor Liu smiled and said, “I’ve been staying at Boss Song’s place every day for the past few days.” ”

“Upon hearing this, Bai Jiayu immediately turned to look at song Shiyu. “Third brother, what’s going on?” ”

“Doctor Liu was song Shiyu’s personal doctor. If song Shiyu hadn’t met with any trouble, doctor Liu wouldn’t have come once every ten days or half a month. ”
