Chapter 209: 091: A GREAT VICTORY! 1

Translator: 549690339

Old Mrs. Lin had a younger sister.

She was ten years younger than her and had a happy family.

It was a pity.

“Her younger sister was infected with Du twenty years ago. After she was infected, she led her brother-in-law to the depths of despair. In the end, she overdosed and had hallucinations. She set fire to the house where she lived, and they were a good family, they were broken up just like that. ”

The family was broken up and the person was dead.

“Therefore, old Mrs. Lin hated people who sucked du the most in her life! ”

“Even if this person was her favorite grandson, it wouldn’t do. ”

Lin Ze wanted to destroy this family!

Destroy her grandmother.

Old Mrs. Lin was so angry that her entire body was trembling. She was about to faint.

“Seeing this, Feng Qianhua quickly walked over to hold old Mrs. Lin and gently explained for Lin Ze, “Aunt Lin, don’t be angry. What if it’s a misunderstanding! Ah Ze is a good child and so obedient. He definitely won’t do such a heinous thing!” ”

“At this moment, Feng Qianhua might as well not explain. ”

“The more she spoke up for Lin Ze, the more she confirmed the fact that Lin Ze was absorbing DU. ” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

She was adding fuel to the fire and increasing old Mrs. Lin’s anger!

“”Qianhua, don’t speak up for him anymore! He’s so rebellious! I was wondering why he’s been acting so mysterious these past few days! So he’s hiding at home doing something shameful!”Old Lady Lin clutched her chest and started coughing violently. ”

“”Grandma Lin, don’t be angry. It’s all my fault. I shouldn’t have said anything...”Feng Qianqian helped Old Lady Lin with her back and said guiltily. ”

Feng Qianhua looked at Feng Qianqian with a satisfied look in her eyes.

It was fleeting.

This daughter of hers was really becoming more and more like her. She would definitely be able to do great things in the future.

“Old Lady Lin turned to look at Feng Qianqian. “Good child, this isn’t your fault! It’s that bastard who doesn’t want to be good!” ”

It was really like a dragon giving birth to a phoenix.

“Feng Qianqian was Feng Qianhua’s daughter, so she had been sensible since she was young. ”

“Lin Ze had crawled out from that slut ye Shu’s stomach. Even if he had the Lin family’s blood flowing in his body, he still had a bad nature deep down in his bones! ”

Old Mrs. Lin felt that it was a pity that Feng Qianqian was not Lin Jincheng’s biological daughter.

“Feng Qianhua continued, “Aunt Lin, please calm down first and clarify the matter. None of us saw Ah Ze do that with our own eyes. It’s not good to wrongly accuse the child like this!” ”

“Aunt Zhang continued, “Miss Qianhua is right! But, old lady, I saw him sucking in young master’s room just now... Let’s go up and see if it’s true...” ”

“Let’s Go!”Old Lady Lin stood up angrily.

They went to Lin Ze’s room on the third floor.

The door was half open.

Lin Ze’s figure could be seen from the outside.

“Lin Ze’s back was facing the crowd, so it was hard to see what he was doing. However, one could vaguely see a bag of white powder on the table. ”

There were also a few pieces of paper.

“If this wasn’t sucking du, what was he doing? ”

“Seeing this scene, old Mrs. Lin’s eyes were full of anger. ”

UNFILIAL grandson!

This unfilial grandson!

He was really too lawless!

Feng Qianhua and Feng Xianxian looked at each other and saw a smug look in each other’s eyes.

“No matter how much Lin Ze tried to sweet-talk her this time, she would probably never forgive him again! ”

“From now on, the Lin family’s assets would no longer have anything to do with Lin Ze. ”

At that time.

“Feng Xianxian would officially become the only daughter of the Lin family, and Feng Qianhua’s child would directly replace Lin Ze’s identity as the heir! ”

“Bastard!”

Old Mrs. Lin couldn’t take it anymore and kicked open the half-closed door.

“Lin Ze was startled by the sudden voice inside and quickly hid the things in his hands into the drawer. He turned around in a panic, “Grandma, Grandma, Why are you here?” ”

“What are you doing?”Old Mrs. Lin glared at Lin Ze as if she was going to eat him.

“Lin Ze avoided old Mrs. Lin’s gaze and said guiltily, “Nothing, nothing much...” ”

“Feng Qianhua stepped forward and said softly, “Ah Ze, you’re still a good kid. We saw what you were doing outside just now! Just admit it! Apologize to your grandmother. You’re your father’s only child. As long as you repent, your grandmother will definitely forgive you!” ”

Feng Qianhua especially emphasized the words ‘you are your father’s only child’.

She said this especially for Old Lady Lin.

It was precisely because Lin ze was Lin Jincheng’s only child and the heir of the Lin family that Lin Ze could not make a single mistake.
