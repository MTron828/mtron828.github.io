Ye Zhuo walked in just like that.

“His picturesque face seemed to be covered in a layer of snow, making people shudder. ”

Seeing ye Zhuo.

Manager Liu instantly felt as if he had seen his backbone. “President Ye!”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

Zhao Xueyin looked up at the door and was stunned.

She didn’t Expect Ye Zao to appear at this time.

Putting on airs in front of her?

How Shameless!

“When she was the current head of Shunxi Financial Group, Ye Zao was still playing in the mud somewhere! ”

Zhao Xueyin looked up. “I told Liu Manshan not to come. Why? Does president ye have a problem with it?”

Ye Zao Could Fire Sun Jiayi in front of her.

Why couldn’t she fire Liu Manshan?

“Today, she was going to kill ye Zhuo’s prestige! ”

She was going to let ye Zhuo know who the real owner of the Shunxi Financial Group was.

“”Tell manager Liu Not to come?”Ye Zhuo walked to the rostrum and looked down at Zhao Xueyin. His tone was so indifferent, “You? Are you qualified?” ”

This way.

He was a little arrogant.

Zhao Xueyin thought she was hearing things.

She was not qualified?

Why was she not qualified?

The person who was not qualified should be ye Zhuo!

Zhao Xueyin narrowed her eyes and turned to look at Annie. “Inform the personnel department immediately and Fire Liu Manshan.”

“Okay.”Annie nodded.

Liu Manshan looked at Ye Zhuo.

He was a little worried.

“Ye Zhuo ignored Zhao Xueyin’s words and placed the document on the table. “Alright, the meeting will continue. Manager Liu, please tell us about Team A’s plan.” ”

“With Ye Zhuo’s words, manager Liu was relieved. He nodded and stood up to speak. ”

Ignoring her.

Ye Zhuo actually ignored her.

“Not only did ye Zhuo ignore her, the rest of the higher-ups also continued the meeting as if they had not heard Zhao Xueyin’s words. ”

Zhao Xueyin was so angry that her entire body was trembling.

Good!

Very good!

Now they could all ignore her.

“Ye Zhuo turned to look at Zhao Xueyin. “If Miss Zhao isn’t willing to participate in the meeting, the main door is over there.” ”

Zhao Xueyin turned around and left.

She wanted to see how ye Zhuo would continue the meeting without her!

“Without her as acting chief, who would sign the proposal? ”

Ye Zhuo thought that she wouldn’t dare to leave?

Just wait.

“In less than three steps, ye Zhuo would ask her to return. ”

One step.

Two Steps.

Three Steps.

“Even when Zhao Xueyin walked to the door, ye Zao did not speak. ”

Zhao Xueyin narrowed her eyes slightly.

What did ye Zao Want to Do?

“At this moment, ye Zao’s voice sounded in the air. ”

“Ellie.”

Zhao Xueyin curled her lips slightly.

She knew ye Zao would ask her to go back.

Ask Ellie to ask her to go back?

Did Ye Zao think that she was the kind of person who could just come and go as she pleased?

“Today, she had to make ye Zhuo personally beg her to come back and preside over the meeting! ”

“Otherwise, ye Zhuo would really think that she was a soft persimmon. ”

He could manipulate her at will.

“President Ye.”Ally walked to Ye Zhuo’s side.

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Close the door.” ”

Close the door?

Ye Zhuo called ally just to make her close the door?

Zhao Xueyin’s face turned pale.

PA —

The door was closed.

Zhao Xueyin’s figure was isolated outside.

The meeting continued inside.

How dare she?

“How dare she, this B * Tch, ye Zao! ? ”

“Zhao Xueyin took a deep breath, feeling as if her lungs were about to explode from anger. ”

The higher-ups in the meeting room also looked at each other.

None of them had expected that ye Zao would be so tough!

He dared to challenge Zhao Xueyin.

But it was also ye Zao who had the ability.

“If it was anyone else, they would not have dared to do so. ”

He was indeed worthy of being elder Ye’s descendant.

He had elder ye’s boldness from back then!

The higher-ups looked at ye Zao and were instantly filled with energy!

Outside the door.

Zhao Xueyin was filled with anger as she walked towards the direction of the office.

“Xueyin!”

Si lui jogged over.

Zhao Xueyin smiled. “Big Brother Si.”

“Si lui continued, “Didn’t you go to a meeting just now? Did you finish it so quickly?” ”

“Yes.”Zhao Xueyin nodded. She didn’t want to say anything more and continued walking forward.

The lawyer frowned. He felt that something was wrong and reached out to stop Annie.

“After Zhao Xueyin left, the lawyer turned to look at Annie and asked, “What happened just now?” ”

Annie’s expression was a little ugly.

“Speak.”

“Annie continued, “Well, Miss Zhao was chased out of the meeting room by President Ye.” ”

What?

Ye Zao actually chased Annie Out!

Si Lui’s expression immediately changed.

Too Much!

Ye Zao was simply too much!

Zhao Xueyin was the acting chief of the Shunxi Financial Group.

“Whether it was her position or strength, she was higher than ye Zao. ”

But ye Zao actually chased Zhao Xueyin out of the meeting room. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Si lui narrowed his eyes and continued, “Then what’s going on with Jiang Xiaoyu?” ”
