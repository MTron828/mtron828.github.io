“I’m asking you a question!”Zhou Xiang continued.

Cen Shaoqing turned a page of the book. “I don’t know either.”

“”What Book Are You Reading?”Zhou Xiang said speechlessly, “Is it that good?””

“It’s not bad.”Cen Shaoqing’s tone was indifferent.

“I asked you what book it is?”Zhou Xiang said unhappily.

Cen Shaoqing’s tone was low. “I’m just taking a look.”

Zhou Xiang:”...”

She could finally see that Cen Shaoqing only acted like a normal person when he was by Ye Zhuo’s side.

“Other times, he was as reticent as gold!”

“After eating, Zhou Xiang stood up from the chair. When she passed by Cen Shaoqing, she specially turned her head to look at his book.”

She thought that Cen Shaoqing was definitely reading some kind of Buddhist scripture.

He did not expect the title of the article to be: how to make durian layer cake.

Zhou Xiang could not help but sigh. “The power of love is really great!”

“If it was in the past, Cen Shaoqing would not even enter the dessert room, let alone read books on this subject.”

“After reading the recipe for several desserts, cen Shaoqing sent a message to ye Zhuo.”

“[ leader, do you want to eat durian layer cake or mango halberd? ]”

“After a while, Ye Zhuo replied, [ I want to eat both. ]”

Cen Shaoqing:”...”

“A few seconds later, Cen Shaoqing replied, [ Okay. ]”

“They had ingredients for these two desserts at home, so it was not too troublesome to cook them.”

“After replying to Ye Zhuo’s message, Cen Shaoqing took the book and walked to the dessert room.”

10:30 pm.

“Ye Zao sat in front of his desk and looked at the big data. At this moment, his phone lit up. Ye Zao picked up his phone and looked at it. It was a message from CEN Shaoqing. [ come down, I’m downstairs. ]”

“Seeing this message, ye Zao immediately put on his coat and walked downstairs with his phone.”

“When he passed by the living room, little white asked, “Big Zao, it’s so late. Where are you going?””

“”I have something to do,”ye Zhuoluo said.”

“Do you want me to help duck?”Little White continued to ask.

“No need.”It was snowing outside. Ye Zhuoluo picked up an umbrella.

“”If you need help, don’t be polite. We’re all on the same side!”Little White shouted at Ye Zhuoluo’s back.”

Ye zhuoluo came to the door.

Cen Shaoqing leaned against the car door. He didn’t have an umbrella. The Snowflakes fell all over his shoulders.

“Why don’t you have an umbrella?”Ye Zao jogged over and held the umbrella over his head.

“It’s okay. I’m not cold.”Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips opened slightly.

Ye Zao stood on Tiptoe and swept the snow on his shoulder. “It’s so late. Why did you come to see me?”

“Didn’t you say that you wanted to eat mango pancake and durian cake?”Cen Shaoqing said.

“You bought it?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly and did not explain that he made it himself. He opened the door of the passenger seat, took out the dessert box inside, and handed it to Ye Zhuo.”

“Ye Zhuo said, “Come in and have a seat with me.””

Cen Shaoqing looked at his watch. “It’s too late. It’s not suitable.”It was not good for girls.

“I didn’t realize that you were so Conservative.”Ye Zhuo took the dessert.

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “Go back quickly. Go to bed early after eating the dessert.””

“When are you going back?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“”I’ll go back when I see you go in,”Cen Shaoqing said.”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “Then I’ll go back first. Drive safe on the road.”

“Okay.”

Cen Shaoqing watched ye Zao’s back.

“Ye Zao took a few steps forward and suddenly turned around. He trotted over and stood on his toes. His red lips landed on the man’s cold chin. “Cen Shaoqing, thank you!””

Cen Shaoqing reached out and hugged her waist. He lowered his head and pecked her lips lightly. “You’re so short!”

“Hearing this, Ye Zao was unhappy. “Who are you calling short! I’m 173 and you’re 190. Aren’t we just 17 centimeters apart?””

“”To be precise, it’s 20 centimeters.”CEN Shaoqing continued, “Grandma was afraid that I would be too tall to find a girlfriend, so she underreported by 3 centimeters.””

Ye Zao:”...”I’m so angry! DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Cen Shaoqing reached out and rubbed ye Zao’s head. “Alright, let’s go back.””

Ye Zao gave him a kick before leaving.

“Looking at a certain someone’s back, Cen Shaoqing’s lips curled into a faint smile.”

What a little girl!

Ye Zhuo carried the dessert box back into the house.

“Coincidentally, Lin Jincheng came down from upstairs. Lin Jincheng asked curiously, “Zhuozhuo, did you order takeout?””

“”No.”Ye Zhuo explained, “Cen Shaoqing brought the dessert. Dad, do you want to try it?””

Lin Jincheng shook his head. “You eat it. I can’t eat it.”
