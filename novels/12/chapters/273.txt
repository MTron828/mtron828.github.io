“Tang Jia said speechlessly, “Don’t worry. Your Sister’s physique is so good. She won’t encounter any problems! Besides, does she look like she’s suffering a loss?” ”

“Zhao Yingjun continued, “Give me 500 yuan.” ”

“What do you need money for?”Tang Jia’s face was full of vigilance.

“”I’ll give it to Pingting.”Zhao Yingjun continued, “Pingting must have been too tired from work recently. I’ll give her some money so that she can buy some delicious food to nourish her body.” ”

Tang Jia was a little unhappy. “Take your own private money! Don’t even think about touching my money!”

“How can you be like this? Isn’t Pingting treating you quite well? You Can’t even bear to take 500 yuan?”

Tang Jia pursed her lips. “300 yuan! I Can’t give you any more! We still have to save our money to buy a house!”

“With that, Tang Jia took out 300 yuan and handed it to Zhao Yingjun. ”

“After receiving the money, Zhao Yingjun quickly went to look for Zhao Pingting. Just as he reached her door, he heard Zhao Pingting coughing in the house. ”

“”Pingting, open the door.” ” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Hearing this, Zhao Pingting hurriedly threw the toilet paper that was covering her mouth into the trash can. She looked at herself in the mirror before walking over to open the door. “Big Brother, why are you here?” ”

“Zhao Yingjun asked with concern, “I heard you coughing in the house just now. Are You Okay?” ”

“Zhao pingting smiled and said, “I’m fine. It’s just that my throat is a little uncomfortable.” ”

“Zhao Yingjun was a little worried. “Why don’t I accompany you to the hospital to take a look? Sometimes, coughing is not a small matter!” ”

“”I’m really fine.”Zhao Pingting sat on the bed as if nothing had happened. She continued, “Big Brother, it’s so late and you’re not sleeping. Is there anything you need from me?” ”

“Zhao Yingjun then remembered what he had to do. He quickly took out 500 yuan from his pocket. “Pingting, your sister-in-law asked me to give you this 500 yuan. She saw that you’ve been working too hard recently, so she asked you to buy some delicious supplements.” ”

“Tang Jia only gave him 300 yuan, and the remaining 200 yuan was Zhao Yingjun’s personal savings. ”

“”Help me thank sister-in-law, but I’m not short of money. You should take this money back.”Zhao pingting continued, “Brother, aren’t you guys preparing to buy a house recently? Hurry up and pay the down payment! Don’t spend money recklessly! My classmate said that the house price in Yunjing will rise again.” ”

“Zhao Yingjun directly stuffed the money into Zhao Pingting’s hands. “Even if you want to buy a house, you don’t lack this 500 yuan! Take it, be good!” ”

“After saying that, Zhao Yingjun turned around and left the room. ”

Zhao Pingting looked at Zhao Yingjun’s back as he left. Her nose was sore and she almost cried.

But she tried her best to hold it in.

“The next day, Zhao Pingting went to work on time. ”

Tang Jia had a rest today.

It was not easy for her to have a day off. She slept until ten in the morning before she woke up.

Everyone in the family went to work.

The house was empty.

“After eating, Tang Jia began to clean. ”

There were many people in the family.

“Every time she cleaned, she would take turns. Whoever rested would get it. ”

“When they cleaned Zhao Pingting’s room, Tang Jia discovered that there was blood on the toilet paper in the trash can. ”

What was going on?

“Tang Jia frowned slightly. She picked up a clump of toilet paper, stood up from the ground, and accidentally knocked over the bag on the table. ”

Crash —

The things in the bag were scattered all over the floor.

Tang Jia quickly squatted down to pick up the things.

“At this moment, Tang Jia suddenly picked up a CT report and a medical case. ”

Patient: Zhao Pingting.

Lung Cancer?

“When she saw these two words, the report fell to the ground, her face pale. ”

Zhao Pingting actually had lung cancer.

The date of her visit was the day Zhao Pingting bought gifts for her family.

At this moment.

Tang Jia finally understood why Zhao Pingting had changed so much during this period of time.

So...

So she had lung cancer.

Zhao Pingting was only nineteen this year.

Tang Jia couldn’t imagine how she had managed to survive by herself these past few days.

Tang Jia couldn’t care less about anything else. She quickly called Zhao Yingjun and her in-laws to tell them to come back as soon as possible.

“She hurriedly hung up the phone and ran out of the door. She didn’t even have time to change her shoes. She ran to a restaurant not far from the neighborhood and found Zhao Pingting, who was serving dishes in the crowd. ”

“Little Sister.”

“Sister-in-law?”Zhao Pingting was a little surprised when she suddenly saw Tang Jia.

Tang Jia directly took the plate from Zhao Pingting’s hand. “Stop carrying plates! Come Home with me!”

“”Sister-in-law, what’s Wrong?”Zhao Pingting looked at Tang Jia in confusion. ”

“You come with me!”Tang Jia dragged Zhao Pingting out.

“At this moment, the restaurant owner walked out from inside. “Little Zhao! It’s a busy time right now. Who are you chatting with? Come in quickly!” ”
