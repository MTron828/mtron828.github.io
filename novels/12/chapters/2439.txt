Chapter 2440: 512: Ye Zao is Miss Ye! 1

Translator: 549690339

Yu Luonian’s intention was very simple.

He wanted to understand ye Zao through ye Zao’s friends.

“Although it was only the first time he met ye Zao, he felt that this girl was even more profound than the sea. ”

It was impossible to see the bottom.

“As Cen Shaoqing’s good brother, Yu Luonian did not want to see Cen Shaoqing being cheated. When that time came, he would lose everything. ”

“Although CEN Shaoqing was experienced and invincible in the business world, in terms of love, Cen Shaoqing was still a young boy who did not know anything. ”

“Yu Luonian nodded. “Yes, I have been single for a long time.” ”

“”Mr. Yu, do you plan to get married and start a Family?”Ye Zhuo continued to ask. ”

“Yu Luonian shook his head and said very frankly, “Life is a lifetime, and the grass and trees will fall in one autumn. I don’t want to be tied down by marriage. I just want to be in love with the person I love. Why do I have to Get Married?” ”

Different views of love led to different understandings of love.

“Ye Zhuo looked at Yu Luonian. “I’m sorry, Mr. Yu, but I don’t have any friends who are suitable for you.” ”

Yu Luonian was stunned. “AH? Why?”

“”Because a great man once said that all relationships that are not for the purpose of marriage are hooligans,”ye Zhuo said. ”

Either be beautiful alone.

Or make a promise to a girl.

Ye Zao did not quite agree with Yu’s view of love in his old age.

People like Yu’s old age obviously just wanted to play around.

“The smile on Yu’s Old Age’s face did not diminish. He continued, “Actually, people who love each other do not have to get married.” ”

“”That is why the friends around me are not suitable for you,”ye Zao said slowly. “They hope to be plain and simple happiness. Three meals a day, four seasons a year. I hope Mr. Yu can find someone who understands you as soon as possible.” ”

“Yu Luonian picked up his cup and took a sip of tea. Then he said, “What about Miss Ye? Does Miss ye not agree with my view of Love?” ”

“”Benevolence is different from benevolence, wisdom is different from wisdom. I respect Mr. Yu’s choice,”ye Zao said faintly. ”

What a good four to two to push a thousand catties.

“Yu Luonian looked at ye Zao, and there were some ripples in his eyes. ”

“In the end, he still underestimated ye Zao. ”

“This girl was not only beautiful, but her temperament and IQ were also on the line. ”

It was completely different from what he had imagined.

Cen Shaoqing picked up a dessert and handed it to Ye Zao. “This tastes pretty good. Try It.”

“Okay.”Ye Zao took the dessert and started to lower his head to taste it.

Yu Shaoqing was slightly stunned.

Cen Shaoqing’s reaction was also unexpected.

Cen Shaoqing had never eaten dessert before.

“But now, for the sake of a girl, he actually started to eat sweets. ”

“”Zixu,”Yu Muannian continued. ”

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing raised his eyes slightly. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Yu Muannian continued, “I was afraid that Miss Ye would be bored, so I invited some girls of the same age as Miss ye today. Let’s go play golf later?” ”

“”Are you going?”Cen Shaoqing did not directly answer Yu Muannian’s words, but turned his head to look at Ye Zhuo. ”

Look at him.

How was this like the CEN fifth master who was a man of his word?

Yu Mumu lowered his head. No one knew what he was thinking about?

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “I’m fine with anything.”It just so happened that he had not played golf for a long time.

Proper exercise could exercise one’s body.

“Yu Mumu immediately said, “Since Miss Ye has no problem with it, then let’s go.” ”

Cen Shaoqing stood up and held ye Zhuo’s hand.

The three of them walked towards the golf course.

Yu Mumu looked sideways at the two of them. His eyes were suddenly filled with envy. He was very envious that Cen Shaoqing always had someone to accompany him wherever he went.

“However, when he thought that it would never be someone else in the future, he was no longer envious. ”

He was still the best.

He could hug this one today and that one the next.

No one could control him.

The golf course was very big.

“The three of them had just arrived when the butler walked to Yu Muqing’s side. “Sir, Miss Linda and the others have arrived.” ”

“Yu Muqing said, “Please come over quickly.” ”

“Okay.”The butler nodded.

“Yu Muqing walked to Cen Shaoqing’s side. “Zixu, they will be here soon.” ”

“Okay.”

Yu Muqing glanced at Cen Shaoqing.

“At this moment, CEN Shaoqing was no different from the CEN Shaoqing he knew. ”

He was a man of few words.

He was a man of few smiles.

“But after being together with Ye Zao, he instantly became another person. ”

It was... very strange.

“Not long after, the butler brought five or six young women who were dressed gorgeously and walked over. ”

“We’re Here!”Yu Sunset’s eyes suddenly lit up. “This way.”

“Young Master Yu!”

“”Young Master Yu, long time no see! I’ve missed you to death!” ”

“...”

Yu was instantly surrounded by a group of women in his old age.

Was this the happiness of the rich?
