Translator: 549690339

She just didn’t marry a good man.

“Speaking up to this point, Zhou Cuihua looked at Li Hang. “So, Hang Hang! If you’re looking for a boyfriend, you must keep your eyes open. Never Look for a poor guy who has nothing!” ”

“No matter how good his character was, he couldn’t marry. ”

“Because from ancient times until now, there hadn’t been any examples of salted fish turning over a new leaf. ”

“Li Hang looked much better than an Lizi. If an Lizi could find a disciple from a powerful family, Li hang could do the same. ”

“Li hang nodded and said with a smile, “Mom, don’t worry. I definitely won’t do worse than an Lizi.” ”

Li hang was very confident.

Zhou cuihua nodded in satisfaction.

“After a while, Li Hang looked at Zhou Cuihua. “Mom, what do you mean by Xia Xiaoman? She asked a servant to send the things back! Does she think that poor relatives like us can’t reach her?” ”

This was too rude!

Zhou Cuihua was also very angry. “I’ve felt that something was wrong since she didn’t ask us to have dinner together!”

“At this point, Zhou Cuihua narrowed her eyes and said, “Maybe that rich businessman doesn’t know about this yet!” ”

“What do you mean?”Li Hang asked.

“Zhou cuihua said, “If the rich businessman knew about this, she could have asked us to bring the things back in front of the rich businessman! There’s no need for her to ask the butler to send the things back! This Xia Xiaoman is too scheming!” ”

“Li hang nodded and felt that what Zhou cuihua said was very reasonable. After all, it was very impolite to return a gift given by someone else, “She pretended to be very warm in front of the rich merchant. The rich merchant definitely wouldn’t have thought that she was a person who would act behind his back in front of him!” ”

“The more they talked, the angrier they became. The more they talked, the more jealous they became. Especially Zhou cuihua, she wished that she could replace Xia Xiaoman! ”

Because Xia Xiaoman was not worthy of Lin Qingxuan at all!

“”Let’s go again tomorrow,”Zhou Cuihua said. ”

“Li hang frowned, “She doesn’t welcome us today. Do We have to go again tomorrow?” ”

“”Yes, not only do we have to go, we have to bring back the things she returned! Let the rich businessmen see her ugly face!” ”

Zhou cuihua only wanted to let Lin Qingxuan discover Xia Xiaoman’s true colors!

“Then, she kicked Xia Xiaoman. ”

“When she thought of Xia Xiaoman’s ending, the corners of Zhou Cuihua’s mouth curled up. ”

“That way, it was as if she had already seen Xia Xiaoman’s ending. ”

“Li hang nodded, “Mom, you’re right.”For a hypocritical person like Xia Xiaoman, she should expose her true colors in time. ”

Punish evil and promote good.

“Otherwise, she would think that there was no justice in this world. ”

“After saying that, Li Hang said with some worry, “But, the rich businessman is so busy. What if he’s not at home tomorrow?” ”

“If the rich businessman was not at home, wouldn’t they have wasted their efforts? ”

“”It won’t be. I’ve already found out from the side. The rich businessman will be at home to take care of the children for the next few days,”Zhou Cuihua said. ”

Li hang nodded. “That’s good.”

“He was afraid that if everything was planned out, all his efforts would be in vain. ”

“Okay.”

“As the mother and daughter spoke, they walked into the elevator. ”

“When they reached home, Li Hang opened the bird’s nest that Xia Xiaoman had asked the butler to send over. He said in surprise, “Mom! Come and take a look!” ”

“What’s Wrong?”Zhou cuihua asked.

“Li hang raised the bird’s nest and said, “Look, this is a celebrity bird’s nest of the same style.” ”

The bird’s nest that Xia Xiaoman had asked the butler to send over was imported from country M. Just one gram was worth five figures.

“And this kind of bird’s nest was sold from twenty grams, so Li Hang had never bought it. ”

Because it was really too expensive!

He didn’t expect that Xia Xiaoman would send over a box.

Zhou Cuihua walked over and took a look. “It really is!”

“As she said that, she said in a somewhat strange tone, “This rich lady from a rich family is really different!” ”

Why did she not have such a good life like Xia Xiaoman?

The next day at 10:30 am.

The mother and daughter duo carried their wine and reappeared at the Lin family villa.

“When they stepped into this villa area again, Zhou Cuihua no longer had the surprise from yesterday. Under the lead of the butler, the two of them came to the living room. ”

The person who brought the baby today was still Lin Qingxuan.

“When he saw Zhou Cuihua and Li Hang, Lin Qingxuan’s head hurt a little. However, the two of them were still Xia Xiaoman’s relatives after all, so he could not show it directly. He still said warmly, “Please take a seat.” ”

“After saying that, he turned to the servant and said, “Quickly go and pour tea for the distinguished guest.” ”

“Okay.”

“Zhou cuihua smiled and said, “Cousin-in-law, you don’t have to be so polite. Actually, we came here today to deliver something.” ”
