Chapter 194: 088: Big Brother Zao is online. I’ve finally found her! 7

“Okay.”Old Madam song nodded and looked at ye Zao carefully.

Because school had just ended, Ye Zao was still wearing the school uniform.

The wide school uniform made her thin and weak body look even thinner. Her hands were very soft, like a piece of warm jade, fair and delicate.

People liked her more and more the more they looked at her.

They just didn’t know if she was fated to meet song Shiyu.

A moment later, ye Zao loosened his grip on old madam song’s wrist, but his expression remained the same.

Old Madam Song asked with a smile, “Zao Zao, do I not have many days left?”

Ye Zao Tucked Old Madam Song’s hand back into the blanket. “Grandma Song, your illness is not a big problem. Rest assured and take care of your body. When spring comes, you will be fine.”

“Zhuo Zhuo, I know my own body.”Saying this, Old Madam song sighed. “People should leave when they’re old. It’s just a pity that I didn’t get to see Shi Yu get married.”

Song Shiyu had always been a worry for Old Madam Song.

This child had suffered a lot when he was young.

Due to his childhood experiences, he was also very withdrawn and even a little violent...

Ye Zhuo patted old madam song’s hand under the blanket. “Grandma Song, you’ll definitely see Mr. Song get married and have children.”

......

“Then I’ll borrow your auspicious words.”

At this moment, a servant came to deliver the medicine to Old Madam Song.

Ye Zhuo stood up and said, “Can you show me the Medicine?”

The servant looked at song Shiyu.

Song Shiyu nodded.

Seeing song Shiyu nod, the servant dared to pass the medicine to Ye Zhuo.

However, when she passed it to him, she lost her balance and spilled the soup on ye Zao’s body.

Ye Zao caught the bowl, but he did not manage to keep the soup inside.

The servant was so frightened that she panicked and immediately apologized, “Miss Ye, I’m sorry! I’m sorry! Let me wipe it off for you!”

Song Shiyu’s face darkened. “Hurry up and get a set of clean clothes for Miss Ye.”

“Okay.”The maid immediately ran out of the door.

Ye Zao patted his clothes. “It’s fine, it’s fine. It’ll be dry in a while.”

“It’s uncomfortable to wear wet clothes. Let’s change into another one.”Old Madam song continued, “Sister Hong, take Zao Zao to the bathroom.”

“Miss Ye, come with me.”The female assistant who had been standing by Old Madam Song’s bed made a ‘please’gesture.

It was indeed uncomfortable to be sticky, so ye Zao did not refuse.

He followed sister Hong to the washroom in the outer hall.

Sister Hong continued, “Miss Ye, please go in first. I’ll stand guard outside for you. I’ll call you when the clothes are delivered.”

“Sorry to trouble you.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

Not long after, a servant came trotting over with a set of clean clothes.

Sister Hong took the clothes and knocked on the door. “Miss Ye, the clothes are here.”

Ye Zhuo opened the door a little and a snow-white arm stretched out from inside. “Sorry to trouble you, Sister Hong.”

A shallow bite mark was particularly eye-catching on the snow-white arm.

Sister Hong narrowed her eyes and handed the bag to Ye Zhuo.

Ye Zhuo took the bag and thanked her.

“Miss Ye, you’re Too Kind,”sister Hong said as she winked at the servant beside her.

The servant immediately understood and trotted out.

Song Shiyu was waiting outside.

The night covered his entire body and the expression on his face could not be seen. His voice was very cold. “How is it?”

“There is indeed a scar on Miss Ye’s arm.”

“A burn?”Song Shiyu asked.

The servant shook her head and tried hard to recall the shape of the scar. “It doesn’t look like a burn. It does look like it was bitten by something.”

“A new injury?”

The servant continued to shake her head. “It’s not a new injury. It looks like it’s been around for some time. It’s just that Miss Ye’s skin is white, so that scar looks very obvious.”

“Alright, Go Do your work,”she added. “I’ll get the housekeeper to give you a raise.”

“Thank you, Boss!”The servant was ecstatic.

She had been in the song family for so long, but this was the first time she had seen song Shiyu take the initiative to give a raise!

If other colleagues found out, they would definitely die of envy.

Song Shiyu returned to Old Madam Song’s room.

His expression was still very indifferent.

Old Madam Song turned to look at Song Shiyu. “Shiyu, tell me honestly, what kind of medicine are you up to?”

Song Shiyu was stunned. “I don’t understand what Grandma means by that?”

“Why did you let Little Zhang Sprinkle the medicine on Searing Scorch all of a sudden?”Old Madam song continued, “Your real intention should be to let searing scorch change his clothes, right?”

“Grandma, you’re worrying too much.”

“You know very well whether it’s worrying too much or not.”Old Madam Song’s gaze fell on the door. “Shiyu, it’s been so many years. Can’t you just have a heart-to-heart with Grandma?”

Even though song Shiyu was old Madam Song’s grandson.

But Old Madam Song had never truly understood this grandson.

“Grandma, take good care of your body. Don’t think too much.”Song Shiyu walked over and helped old Madam Song Tuck in the Cup.

Not long after, Ye Zhuo changed into a new set of clothes and walked in from outside.

The light green dress suited her skin very well.

“You look very beautiful in this dress!”Old Madam song complimented from the bottom of her heart.

Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly. “Could it be because you look good?”

Old Madam Song was tickled by her and laughed softly.

Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “That’s right, Grandma Song. You should smile more. Smiling more can increase the breathing function of your lungs and express healthy emotions. It will be of great help to your body.”

The smile on Old Madam Song’s face became even wider. “Alright, Alright, Alright. Then I’ll listen to Yezi and smile more in the future.”

After chatting with Old Madam Song for a while and writing a prescription, Ye Zao said goodbye.

Song Shiyu sent ye Zao off.

After walking out of old Madam Song’s Courtyard, Ye Zao took the initiative to say, “Grandma song has at most half a year’s time. Mr. Song, you have to be mentally prepared.” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Hearing this, Song Shiyu did not show any special emotions on his face. “Is there no other way?”

Ye Zhuo shook his head. “Grandma song has already reached her age, and all the organs in her body have begun to gradually fail. However, the medicine I have prescribed can help Grandma song reduce her pain.”

Doctors could only treat illnesses.

Even if ye Zhuo was Hua Tuo, he could not prevent natural aging and death.

Song Shiyu did not say anything else.

Over the years, he had grown accustomed to life and death. Even if old madam song were to go now, he would not be able to squeeze out even a single tear.

Song Shiyu drove ye Zhuo to the entrance of the unit where the Ye family lived.

“Thank you, Mr. Song, for driving me back. Be careful on the road.”Ye Zhuo got out of the car and thanked him.

“I should be the one thanking you.”Song Shiyu said slowly, “Miss Ye, you don’t have to be so polite. Just call me by my name in the future.”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “Then you don’t have to be polite with me. Just call me by my name! It’s too late now, so I won’t ask you to go in for tea. I’ll go back first.”

“Okay, I should go back too.”Song Shiyu got into the car and closed the door.

The car that was supposed to be speeding on the highway stopped at a fork in the road not far from the Ye family’s estate.

Song Shiyu pulled down the red rope around his neck, and the hostility in his eyes dissipated bit by bit. “I’ve finally found you.”
