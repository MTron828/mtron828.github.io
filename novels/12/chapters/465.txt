“Cen Yuyan was already feeling bad about missing out on a limited edition ZY. Now that she saw Cen Yueya wearing her new clothes on the other end of the screen, she felt even worse. ”

“If she hadn’t thrown away the packaging box, she wouldn’t have to Envy Cen Yueya now. ”

It was all her fault...

She was too impulsive.

Cen Yueya frowned slightly when she saw the video that was hung up. “What’s wrong with these four girls? They’re so Strange.”

“Cen Yuyan couldn’t tell the CEN sisters about her grievance, so she could only send the video to Song Chenyu. ”

“Song Chenyu was sitting in the makeup room removing her makeup. From the looks of it, she should have just finished shooting the commercial. ”

“”Yuyan, what’s Wrong?”No matter what, Song Chenyu always had a smile on her face. ”

“In addition to her beautiful appearance, she gave people an inexplicable sense of affinity. ”

“Therefore, song Chenyu’s affinity with the audience was very good. ”

“”Chenyu, are you free tonight? I want to talk to you.” ”

Song Chenyu looked at his watch. “Come to my house at 10:30 and look for me.”

“Okay.”Cen Yuyan nodded.

...

On the other side.

Cen Shaoqing was a little depressed after receiving the ‘love each other as a family’message.

Ye Zhuo had prepared gifts for everyone in his family.

He just didn’t prepare anything for him.

Why was this so?

Could it be that he didn’t do anything well enough to make ye Zhuo angry?

“For a moment, CEN Shaoqing was very perturbed. ”

The full score for the internship period was 100 points.

“Not only did he not add a single point, but he also lost more than ten points because of He Zi’s bad move. ”

“If this continued, would he not even pass the internship period? ”

Cen Shaoqing held the Buddha bead in his hand and looked up at ye Zao beside him. He was inexplicably a little nervous.

“Ye Zao was about to make tea when he opened the tea barrel and saw that the tea leaves were already gone. He looked back at CEN Shaoqing and said, “There are no more tea leaves at home. is sprite okay?” ”

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

Ye Zhuo took out two bottles of sprite from the fridge and threw one bottle to Cen Shaoqing.

This was Cen Shaoqing’s first time drinking sprite.

“In the past, what he drank was either tea or water. ”

“When the ice sprite entered his throat, there was an indescribable sense of excitement. ”

It seemed to be a little spicy.

The taste was not as good as he had imagined.

Did all the young girls nowadays like to drink this kind of thing?

Cen Shaoqing looked at the green coke bottle and narrowed his eyes slightly.

“You don’t Like This?”Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly.

“Cen Shaoqing hurriedly denied, “No, it tastes very good! I like it very much!” ”

“”That’s good.”Ye Zhuo continued, “Wait for me for a moment.” ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

Ye Zhuo turned around and walked into the room.

“Not long after, she came out with an emerald-green rectangular paper box in her hand. “This is for you. When I went out this morning, I was so busy making you take those clothes that I forgot about this.” ”

Was this a gift from ye Zao?

So he had a gift too!

“The haze in Cen Shaoqing’s heart instantly disappeared, but his expression remained the same. “This is for me?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded and looked back at the clock on the wall. “My mom and the others will be back soon. You should go back quickly.”

“Am I so shameful?”Cen Shaoqing raised his eyebrows slightly.

“Cen Shaoqing had been in a high position for a long time. No matter where he went, everyone treated him respectfully. ”

This was the first time he was chased away by someone.

Ye Zhuo pushed him out. “I haven’t announced our relationship to my mom and the others. It’s already nine o’clock. Don’t you think it’s inappropriate for a man and a woman to be alone?”

“Why not?”Cen Shaoqing looked down at her.

“Ye Zhuo pushed him as he said, “Because you’re still an intern.” ”

“...”Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips parted. “Then when can we announce it?”

Ye Zhuo placed his hand on Cen Shaoqing’s waist and suddenly realized that this guy’s waist was quite thin. There was not a single bit of fat on it. Summer’s expectations were very thin. She even touched the firm abdominal muscles in her lower abdomen. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Tsk.

His figure was really not bad!

No wonder Old Lady Cen said that this person often exercised.

Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly.

“Feeling the hands that were messing around his waist, Cen Shaoqing’s breathing became a little hurried at this moment. The blood in his body was boiling. A familiar yet strange feeling came as promised. ”

One of his hands held onto ye Zao’s hand. His tone was low and somewhat hoarse. “I’m asking you a question.”

The Buddha Pearl in Cen Shaoqing’s palm pressed against her hand and it hurt a little. How much strength did this person use?

Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly.

“When can it be announced?”Cen Shaoqing asked in a hoarse voice again.

Only then did ye Zao React. “You can do your best and announce it after your internship.”
