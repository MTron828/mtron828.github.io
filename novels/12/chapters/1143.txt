Translator: 549690339

“Jiang Xiaoyu quickly reacted, then, he said, “Miss Ye, I’m sorry to bother you so late at night! “This is the dessert I brought for you. Our chauffeur said that although this dessert is located in a remote area and not expensive, the taste is definitely top-notch! “I guarantee that you’ll want to eat it again after the first time!” ”

Ye Zhuo’s gaze fell on the food bag in Jiang Xiaoyu’s hand. “Have a seat first. I’ll go and change my clothes.”

“Upon receiving ye Zhuo’s instructions, Jiang Xiaoyu immediately sat down on the sofa. ”

“A moment later, ye Zhuo changed his clothes and walked out of the house. ”

“”Doggie, pour some water for the guest.” ”

Xiaobai’s voice came from inside. “I’m making tea!”

“Make me a cup too.”

“Got it!”

“Jiang Xiaoyu said a little embarrassedly, “I’m not thirsty. I don’t need to pour water. Miss Ye, I’m here to thank you. Thank you for reminding me so that I can see Zhao Xueyin’s true face clearly...” ”

“”It’s good that you can see it clearly. Everyone makes mistakes sometimes. The most important thing is not to make them again in the future,”ye Zao’s tone was indifferent. ”

Even though Jiang Xiaoyu had not known ye Zao for long.

“However, in Jiang Xiaoyu’s eyes, ye Zao seemed to have always been this indifferent. ”

“”Miss Ye, don’t worry. I’ll definitely make them again!” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“The air seemed to have fallen into an awkward and strange atmosphere. Jiang Xiaoyu immediately took out the dessert. “Miss Ye, quickly try the taste of the dessert I bought.” ”

Ye Zhuo picked up a piece of thousand layer cake.

He took a small sip.

It melted in his mouth.

It left a pleasant taste in his mouth.

“The taste was indeed not bad. Ye Zhuo turned to look at Jiang Xiaoyu and asked, “Which dessert shop did you buy this from?” ”

“Jiang Xiaoyu smiled and said, “I just returned to China yesterday. I don’t know the exact address, but my chauffeur knows. I’ll help you ask our chauffeur tomorrow! Then I’ll send you a wechat message! “Oh right, I don’t think I have your wechat. Why don’t we add each other on wechat?” ”

She said the last sentence very carefully.

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo took out his phone.

She agreed!

Ye Zhuo agreed!

Oh My God!

She actually added ye Zhuo’s wechat.

“Jiang Xiaoyu was even happier than winning the five million yuan prize. She immediately took out her phone and said, “Miss Ye, I’ll scan you!” ” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Ye Zhuo took out the QR code.

Beep!

She had successfully added him as a friend.

Jiang Xiaoyu typed the word “Goddess”in her wechat comment.

“Just as Jiang Xiaoyu was commenting, Ye Zhuo had already finished three desserts. ”

“Aren’t you going to eat?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“I’m... I’m not hungry.”Jiang Xiaoyu was a little embarrassed.

“Gulp.”

“At this moment, the sound of her stomach was heard in the air. ”

Jiang Xiaoyu:”...”

“At this moment, Xiao Bai served the tea that had been brewed. ”

“Ye Zao said, “I’m a little hungry. Go make two bowls of beef noodles.” ”

“Okay.”

Jiang Xiaoyu looked at ye Zao in surprise.

Ye Zao had bought a lot of semi-finished beef noodles and placed them in the refrigerator. He only needed to heat them up and add some spicy seeds and coriander.

“Soon, Xiao Bai came over with the cooked beef noodles. ”

The fragrant question went straight into Jiang Xiaoyu’s nose.

It made Jiang Xiaoyu swallow her saliva.

Fragrant.

It was too fragrant!

Ye Zhuo picked up his chopsticks and ate the beef noodles.

Jiang Xiaoyu was a little embarrassed.

Ye Zhuo looked up slightly. “Hurry up and eat. It Won’t taste good when it gets cold.”

“Hearing this, Jiang Xiaoyu put down all her persistence and picked up her chopsticks to eat the noodles. ”

Slurp slurp.

“In the end, she even drank the noodle soup. ”

“”Miss Ye, your noodles are really delicious!” ”

“”If you’re not full, you can ask Xiaobai to cook another bowl.” ”

“”No need, no need.”Jiang Xiaoyu could not help but Burp. “I’m already full!” ”

“After that night, Jiang Xiaoyu returned to the Ye residence for a few days. ”

“If ye Zhuo was busy, she would talk to Xiao Bai or play with the cat. ”

“In the blink of an eye, a week had passed. ”

Su Qiang had been taking traditional Chinese medicine for a week.

“These days, he could clearly feel that his body was much better. ”

“In the past, he would pant when he took two steps. ”

“Now, he could even jog when he walked. ”

His strength had also recovered a lot.

“Seeing that Su Qiang was getting better and better day by day, Auntie Wang said, “Why don’t I ask for leave today and bring you to the hospital to have a look?” ”

“Su Qiang smiled and said, “There’s no need to ask for leave. I can go by myself.” ”

“”How can you go by yourself!”As she said that, Auntie Wang called to ask for leave. ”

“Because Ma Jia Yue had previously instructed them, the butler immediately informed Ma Jia Yue after receiving Auntie Wang’s call for leave. ”

“When she received the call, Ma Jianyue was shopping with Zhao Xueyin. “Really? Wang Sao really took leave to go to the hospital?” ”

“”Absolutely. Wang Sao personally called me to tell me. From her tone, she should be quite anxious! Oh right, she also asked me for President Ye’s address.” ”

“Ma Jianyue asked, “Did you tell her?” ”

“”I don’t know where President Ye lives either, so I gave her the address of Shunxi Financial Group!” ”

“”Okay, I got it!” ”

“After hanging up the phone, Ma Jianyue’s face was still full of joy. She turned to Zhao Xueyin and said, “Xueyin! Ye Zao is finished now!” ”

“What’s Wrong?”

“Ma Jianyue told her about sister-in-law Wang asking for leave to go to the hospital, “If it’s not serious, what’s the point of going to the hospital? Moreover, the Butler said that sister-in-law also asked for Ye Zhuo’s address! She must be looking for ye Zhuo to demand an explanation!” ”

“After all, Ma Jianyue had made it clear at that time. ”

“If anything happened, Ye Zhuo would take full responsibility. ”

“Hearing that, Zhao Xueyin’s face was full of joy that could not be concealed. ”

“Ma Jianyue continued, “Call the police! Let’s quickly call the police! Let’s wait for a rabbit in the consortium! In case sister-in-law is bribed by Ye Zhuo!” ”

“In a poor family, a life was nothing? ”

“When Ye Zhuo gave sister-in-law Wang a few million, perhaps sister-in-law Wang would not pursue the matter! ”

“Zhao Xueyin also thought of this and immediately said, “I’ll immediately contact officer Wang!” ”
