The person who can’t give birth is Zhao Shuning?

The moment these words left his mouth...

The atmosphere turned silent.

Old Lady Lin looked at Lin Qingxuan in disbelief.

“Zhao shuning was completely stunned. It was as if someone had poured a bucket of cold water on him from top to bottom. From head to toe, it felt as if his blood was about to freeze. All the strength in his body seemed to have been sucked away in that instant. ”

I know...

Lin Qingxuan actually knows?

How did Lin Qingxuan Know?

Zhao shuning never dreamed that Lin Qingxuan would know about this.

No!

She wasn’t the one who was infertile!

The one who was infertile was Lin Qingxuan. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“All these years, she had been taking the blame for Lin Qingxuan. ”

“Thinking of this, Zhao shuning tried hard to calm herself down. ”

“”Qingxuan, what... What are you saying?”Old Lady Lin looked at Lin Qingxuan, her voice trembling. ”

“In Old Lady Lin’s eyes, Zhao shuning had always been a good daughter-in-law and a good wife. ”

She had never thought that all of this was fake.

It was all Zhao shuning lying to her!

Did she hear wrongly?

“She must have heard wrongly, right? ”

“Lin Qingxuan took a deep breath. “I said, the person who can’t give birth isn’t me at all! It’s Zhao shuning!” ”

“Zhao shuning pounced over and grabbed Lin Qingxuan’s arm. “Lin Qingxuan, you’re talking nonsense! You’re the one who can’t have children! It’s You!” ”

“Lin Qingxuan shook Zhao shuning off and his voice was a little cold. He had never thought that the person next to him would lie to him, “I went to the hospital for a checkup today! The Doctor said that I’m Fine! Zhao shuning, stop pretending! After pretending for so many years, aren’t you tired?” ”

He was grateful for everything that Zhao shuning had done for him.

“Because he was grateful, he could tolerate everything about Zhao shuning. ”

But Zhao shuning lied to him.

It was not a good feeling to be lied to.

“Every time he saw the other family of three enjoying themselves, he felt very sorry for Zhao shuning. ”

“All these years, he had been living in guilt. ”

“”It was a misdiagnosis! The hospital must have misdiagnosed it!”Zhao shuning said with trembling lips, “The one who can’t give birth is you, Li Qingxuan!” ”

She had dedicated 21 years of her youth to Lin Qingxuan.

She didn’t expect that Lin Qingxuan would treat her like this!

“Zhao shuning hugged Old Lady Lin again, she cried, “Mom! You have to help me! I’ve been in the Lin family for so many years, and I’ve never done anything to let Qingxuan down. Instead, I’ve lost my right to be a mother because of him. He can’t treat me like this! Mom!” ”

“Old Mrs. Lin patted Zhao shuning on the back. “Don’t worry, I’ll help you with this matter!” ”

“Lin Qingxuan looked at Zhao shuning. “I’ve been to five hospitals in total, and the five reports are all normal! Could it be that the five hospitals have all misdiagnosed?” ”

Five reports!

“At this moment, Zhao shuning felt that this man in front of her was extremely unfamiliar. ”

She had never thought that Lin Qingxuan would not trust her.

He used to love her so much. How could he go to the hospital for a checkup behind her back?

“She had been married to Lin Qingxuan for so many years and had taken the blame for him for so many years. It was fine if Lin Qingxuan did not appreciate her, but he still suspected her! ”

What right did Lin Qingxuan have?

Old Lady Lin extended her hand to Lin Qingxuan. “Bring Me the report!”

Lin Qingxuan took out the report from her bag and handed it to Old Lady Lin.

“No! You Can’t look at it!”

“Zhao shuning panicked. He snatched the report and tore it into pieces, “It’s fake! These reports are all fake! Mom, don’t believe him! This is fake! Qingxuan is the one who can’t have children! It has nothing to do with me! Nothing to do with me!” ”

“It had been twenty-one years. Sometimes, Zhao shuning even fooled herself. ”

She had never thought that Lin Qingxuan would discover something.

“Seeing this scene, what else did Old Lady Lin not understand? ”

“All these years, she had always felt sorry for Zhao shuning. She felt sorry for Zhao shuning for enduring humiliation and bearing too much of a bad name for Lin Qingxuan. ”

“In addition, Zhao shuning came from the same family as her. She believed that Zhao shuning was a good child. Even though she was suspicious by nature, she had never doubted Zhao shuning. ”

“Even though she knew that Zhao shuning would always hit and scold Lin Qingxuan, she turned a blind eye to it. ”

Because she knew that Zhao shuning was not having it easy.

“As a woman, she understood Zhao shuning. ”

She had never thought that Zhao shuning was such a person!

“B * Tch!”Old Lady Lin couldn’t contain her anger. She raised her hand and slapped Zhao shuning. “You snake-hearted B * Tch! What did our Lin family do to you? I treated you so well!”

Zhao shuning was stunned. She looked at Old Lady Lin with disbelief in her eyes.
