Translator: 549690339

Father he had always been the one who focused on the outside but not the inside.

Everything at home was managed by mother he.

“Mother he glanced at him and continued, “Don’t worry, with the weak feelings between them, they definitely won’t last three years. One year, at most one year, they will end up breaking up.” ”

Father he heaved a sigh of relief when he saw how confident his wife was.

“Ever since she came to He Chaonan’s apartment to drink, Mi Chen had been coming to the apartment more and more frequently. ”

“However, he ziteng didn’t suspect anything. ”

“Instead, he thanked Mi Chen for taking the time to accompany Xu Yao. ”

“Mi chen smiled and said, “We’re all friends. You’re welcome.” ”

Another month passed.

“That morning, Xu Yao suddenly felt uncomfortable. ”

“Her head was heavy and her legs were light. Her chest was still very stuffy. Because she felt too uncomfortable, Xu Yao did not wake up. ”

“Today, he ziteng was resting. He woke up very early and specially made Xu Yao’s favorite stewed dumplings. ”

“”Yaoyao, quickly get up, brush your teeth, wash your face, and eat. I made your favorite stewed dumplings this morning,”he ziteng said as he walked into the room. ”

“Xu Yao said, “I can’t eat. I want to sleep a little longer.” ”

“Hearing this, he ziteng walked over nervously and reached out to touch Xu Yao’s forehead. “Are you feeling unwell?” ”

“”I’m not feeling unwell. I just want to sleep for a while longer,”Xu Yao continued. ”

“He ziteng said, “Then I’ll make some food and bring it over for you. You have to eat something in the morning. Otherwise, it’s not good for your body. Let’s eat before we sleep, okay?” ”

“”Okay,”Xu Yao replied in a daze. ”

He Ziteng went back to make breakfast.

“Soon, the braised dumplings were ready. He ziteng brought the dumplings to the kitchen. “Yaoyao, get up and eat.” ”

“Hearing he ziteng’s voice, Xu Yao was a little irritated. She even wanted to scold him. ”

But she still held it in.

“Xu Yao lifted the blanket and started to get up. But when she smelled the smell of the braised dumplings in the air, her stomach churned. That feeling was very uncomfortable, as if she would vomit at any time. ”

Xu Yao immediately ran to the bathroom and vomited all the food in her stomach.

“Seeing this, he ziteng said nervously, “Yaoyao, Yaoyao, what’s wrong? Why are you throwing up?” ”

“Xu Yao’s face was very pale. She covered her chest and said, “I’m fine.” ”

“”You’re already throwing up so badly, and you still say you’re fine!”He ziteng continued, “I’ll call doctor Mi to come over and take a look.” ”

“”It’s just a small problem,”Xu Yao continued, “You don’t have to call Doctor Mi. I’m really fine. I’ll probably be fine after eating something.” ”

“He ziteng supported Xu Yao as the two of them walked into the bedroom. They smelled the smell of the oil-braised dumplings again, and Xu Yao’s stomach churned again. She ran back into the bathroom and started throwing up. ”

“He ziteng patted Xu Yao’s back and was extremely anxious. “Yaoyao, did you eat something bad?” ”

Xu Yao shook her head.

She had been eating very normally these few days and had not eaten anything special. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“As she vomited, Xu Yao felt that something was not right. ”

Could it be that she was pregnant?

“Thinking of this, Xu Yao was ecstatic. ”

That’s right.

She definitely was pregnant!

“He ziteng continued, “No, I have to call Mi Chen immediately and ask him to come over.” ”

“This time, Xu Yao did not stop him. ”

“About an hour later, Mi Chen arrived. ”

“”Ziteng, what did you say about Xu Yao’s condition?” ”

“He ziteng said, “She vomited terribly. This morning, she vomited several times! Mi Chen, show her if she ate something bad!” ”

“He ziteng had never experienced such a thing, so naturally, he would not think about being pregnant. ”

“What he was worried about now wasn’t that Xu Yao had eaten something wrong, but whether Xu Yao was sick! ”

“Mi Chen took out her stethoscope and looked at Xu Yao’s tongue. Finally, she put down the stethoscope. Before she could say anything, he ziteng couldn’t wait to ask, “Mi Chen, is Yaoyao Alright?” ”

“Mi chen smiled and said, “Ziteng, Congratulations.” ”

Congratulations?

For what?

He ziteng was stunned.

Xu Yao narrowed her eyes. It looked like she was really pregnant!

This was great!

He ziteng looked at Mi Chen. “What are you congratulating me for?”

“Mi chen smiled and said, “You might be going to be a father.” ”

A father!

“At that moment, he ziteng thought he was hearing things. ”

“”W-what did you say?”After a long while, he ziteng found his voice again. ”

“Mi Chen continued, “Congratulations on becoming a father, but I’m not sure if Xu Yao is pregnant. I suggest you go to the hospital for a detailed check-up.” ”

“Really? I’m really going to be a father!”He ziteng stood up from his chair happily.

“Yes.”Mi Chen nodded.

He ziteng was ecstatic. He reached out and grabbed Xu Yao’s shoulder. “Yaoyao. Yaoyao! I’m going to be a father! You’re going to be a mother!”

He was so happy!

“After having a child, his mother would definitely agree to his marriage with Xu Yao. ”

“After all, his parents had long wanted to have a grandchild. ”

“Xu Yao was much calmer than he ziteng. She continued, “Didn’t Big Brother Mi say it just now? He’s not sure if he’s really pregnant either. Everything will only be confirmed after he goes to the hospital for a check-up.” ”

Mi Chen nodded. “Xu Yao is right.”

“He ziteng held Xu Yao’s hand and said, “We’ll go do the test right now!” ”

He couldn’t wait to confirm this good news.

Xu Yao nodded.

“He ziteng looked at Mi Chen. “Mi Chen, help yourself. I’ll take Yaoyao to the hospital first.” ”

“You’ll drive there?”Mi Chen asked.

He ziteng nodded.

“Mi chen smiled and said, “Why don’t I Drive You There? You’re so excited right now. It’s not suitable for you to drive.” ”

“”That’s fine too.”He ziteng handed the keys to mi Chen and said, “Thank you for your hard work, Mi Chen.” ”

“”It’s my pleasure,”mi Chen said. ”

Mi Chen’s driving skills were pretty good. They soon arrived at the city hospital.

Mi Chen sat in the car. “I won’t get out. I’ll wait for you guys in the car.”

He ziteng nodded. “Okay.”

Mi Chen looked at he ziteng and Xu Yao’s disappearing figures in front of her and narrowed her eyes.

He ziteng.

He could disappear from this world very soon.

He ziteng brought Xu Yao to the gynecology department to register and then queued up for an examination.

“After a long while, he finally received the report form. ”

“He ziteng could not understand the report form either. He turned to Xu Yao and said, “Yaoyao, you rest here for a while. I’ll go and ask the Doctor.” ”

“Xu Yao smiled and said, “I’ll go with you.” ”

“That’s fine too.”He ziteng nodded.

“Very soon, they arrived at the Doctor’s office. He ziteng could not wait to ask, “Doctor, may I ask if my girlfriend is pregnant?” ”

“The Doctor took the report, looked at it, and nodded. “Congratulations, your girlfriend is indeed pregnant! After all, she’s already six weeks pregnant! Remember not to exercise intensely for the first three months, and then...” ”

The Doctor gave some instructions.

“Hearing this, he ziteng was very excited. He picked Xu Yao up on the spot and cheered. ”

“Seeing this, the doctor quickly said, “Quick, quick, quick! Stop! Didn’t I just tell you not to exercise too intensely?” ”

“He ziteng immediately put Xu Yao down. “I’m too excited! Yaoyao, are you alright? Are you feeling unwell?” ”

“”I’m fine.”Xu Yao smiled and said, “Don’t worry, I’m not that delicate.” ”

“When he heard that Xu Yao was fine, he ziteng heaved a sigh of relief. ”

“Ever since he came out of the hospital, the smile on he ziteng’s face had not disappeared. ”

“After getting into the car, he ziteng did not wait for Mi Chen to ask. He said, “Brother! Brother! I’m going to be a father! I’m really going to be a father!” ”

“Mi chen smiled and said, “Congratulations.” ”

“”Same to you.”He ziteng continued, “I have to quickly tell my parents the good news!” ”

“”Wait a minute,”Xu Yao suddenly said. ”

“What’s Wrong?”He ziteng asked.

“Xu Yao continued, “Don’t tell uncle and Auntie for the time being.” ”

“He ziteng asked in puzzlement, “Why?” ”

“Xu Yao continued, “I’m only one month pregnant. Under normal circumstances, pregnant women would only announce this news three months later.” ”

“Because the first three pregnancies were unstable, it was very easy for the fetus to slip. For the conservative period, it would be announced three months later. ”

“Hearing this, he ziteng nodded. “Alright, I’ll listen to you.” ”

“Mi Chen’s eyes were filled with a sinister light. Unfortunately, he ziteng, who was sitting in the back seat, could not see it at all. ”

“He ziteng had always loved Xu Yao. When he found out that Xu Yao was pregnant, he held her in his hands and refused to let her do anything. ”

He hired five servants at once to take care of Xu Yao’s daily life.

“Originally, there was only one servant responsible for cleaning in he ziteng’s small apartment. ”

It was a pity that Xu Yao did not let him tell the good news to others for the time being.

“In the blink of an eye, another fifteen days passed. ”

“In order to take good care of Xu Yao, he ziteng specifically asked for leave to accompany her during this period of time. ”

“To He ziteng, nothing was more important than accompanying Xu Yao. ”

“With he ziteng’s company, Xu Yao was very troubled. ”

“Previously, when he ziteng was busy, she could see Mi Chen at least once a day. Now, she hadn’t seen Mi Chen for three days! ”

No.

She had to think of a way to see Mi Chen.

“At this moment, Mi Chen sent a wechat message to give Xu Yao some advice. ”

Xu Yao curved her lips slightly and walked in front of He ziteng. “Ziteng.”

“What’s Wrong?”He ziteng turned around.

“Xu Yao continued, “I want you to drink the Ji Rui milk tea that you bought for me personally.” ”
