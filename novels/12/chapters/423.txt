“Chapter 424: 120: Xi Da Pu Ben, Five Ye Confession Big Burning, together! Six”

Translator: 549690339

The roots of the burning leaves were a little red.

“Before she met Cen Shaoqing, including in her previous life, she had never considered falling in love. ”

And now I can’t Say No.

Maybe.

She could try love.

“”Ye Zhuo, stay with me. From now on, you will be my leader. Our Cen family will be under the leadership of the leadership. All assets under my name will be under the leadership of the leadership. Together with myself, I will be under the leadership of you.” ”

“Ye Zhuo looked up at Cen Shaoqing and enunciated each word clearly. “Then, I officially announce that Mr. Cen Shaoqing has entered the internship period.” ”

“”Really?”Cen Wu Ye, who was calm and composed a second ago, suddenly became ecstatic. His eyes were filled with light. ”

He promised him!

Ye Zhuo promised him!

Cen Shaoqing felt that he had never been so happy before.

His heart was filled at this moment.

Even if it was just entering the internship period.

“Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “Don’t be happy too early. If the internship period doesn’t pass, we will still return to the same path!” ”

“I guarantee that the leader will be satisfied.”Cen Shaoqing stood up and gave a very standard salute.

“After all, he was someone who had lived in the Middle East. Although he had been a vegetarian all these years, he still carried a bit of blood in him. ”

“Ye Zao tapped the table with his fingers. “Now, let me talk about what I’m not satisfied with. Do you know why I only let you enter the internship period?” ”

Cen Shaoqing was stunned.

Was there anything about him that ye Zao was not satisfied with?

“”Please instruct me, leader.” ”

“Ye Zao continued, “First of all, when we went shopping last time, the pink dresses that you gave me were really complicated. I clearly said that I didn’t like them and that they didn’t look good, so why do you want me to do whatever I Want?” ”

Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly. “You don’t like them?”

“”Do you think I’m a Barbie Doll?”Ye Zhuo continued, “Besides, when have you ever seen me wear such exaggerated clothes?” ” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Cen Shaoqing was stunned again.

He really didn’t seem to have seen ye Zhuo wear such clothes before.

“CEN Shaoqing said, “But don’t girls like to speak the truth? If they say that they don’t like them, then they like them. If they say that they don’t want them, then they want...” ”

Ye Zhuo was so angry that he laughed. “Who told you that?”

“Cen Shaoqing told him the truth, “It was Ziteng who told me. The last time at the sweet water shop, you clearly said that you didn’t like to eat sweet potatoes, but I ordered milk, sweet potato, and tapioca. Not only did you eat happily, but you also ordered another serving after you finished eating.” ”

“If it weren’t for the bowl of milk, sweet potato, and tapioca, Cen Shaoqing wouldn’t be so sure that girls liked to speak the truth. ”

“Ye Zhuo took a deep breath and tried his best to calm himself down, “So, that’s why you did so many strange things. You brought me to watch movies that I don’t like, you treated me to milk tea that I don’t like, you bought things that I don’t like, and you gave me food that I don’t like to eat?” ”

“You don’t like all of these?”Cen Shaoqing frowned.

“Ye Zhuo nodded and said very seriously, “Yes! I don’t like all of them!” ”

“Then what’s with the milk and sweet potato sago?”

“Ye Zhuo explained, “The milk and sweet potato sago is because I ate a very disgusting type of sweet potato when I was young. Therefore, in my subconscious mind, sweet potatoes are a very scary food. “But I didn’t expect that yesterday’s sweet water shop could make sweet potatoes taste so delicious.” ”

“So, it’s just a coincidence? ”

Shum Siu Ching was stunned.

“Ye Zhuo continued: “To say the truth is to divide people, some girls are more shy, occasionally more like to say the truth, but this is only in a few cases.”. Moreover, the truth is that there is no distinction between men and women, my head teacher is a typical like the truth to say the person. However, most people don’t have the habit of saying the opposite! Therefore, Mr. Cen Shaoqing, please be more normal in the future. Otherwise, you will never pass the internship.” ”

Cen Shaoqing’s breathing stopped.

Dog He ziteng!

I was almost killed by him!

“If it wasn’t for he ziteng, he might not even need to enter the internship and directly become a full-time student. ”

This dog!

It was really too much of a delay!

“On the other side, he ziteng sneezed inexplicably. ”

“He ziteng scratched his head and said with a puzzled look, “Did someone miss me?” ”

“Cen Shaoqing looked at ye Zao and opened his thin lips slightly. He said very seriously, “Leader, don’t worry. I will definitely change.” ”

Ye Zao nodded in satisfaction.

“Cen Shaoqing continued to ask, “So, is there a deadline for the internship period?” ”

“Ye Zhuo thought for a moment, “I haven’t decided yet. It depends on my mood.” ”

Cen Shaoqing only wanted to kill the dog now!

“Over there, he ziteng sneezed again. ”
