“Doctor Liu looked at Han Laoshan and continued, “Don’t be too happy yet. An Gong’s bezoar pill is priceless. Even if you can buy it, 70-80% of it is fake.” ”

“At this point, doctor Liu paused, then, he said, “To say the least, even if you really get the authentic bezoar pill, I only have 70% confidence. So, old Mr. Han, don’t be too excited. “Moreover, Mr. Xiao Han only has two months left. Are you sure that you can find the bezoar pill within two months?” ”

“Yes.”Han Laoshan nodded seriously. “I’m sure.”

“”So, you really have news of the Bezoar Pill?”Dr. Liu asked. ”

“Yes.”

“Dr. Liu Sat up straight. “Then what are you waiting for! Hurry up and buy the Bezoar Pill. With Mr. Xiao Han’s current condition, the sooner he takes the Bezoar Pill, the greater the hope of recovery!” ”

“Really?”Han Laoshan asked.

“”Of course it’s true!”Doctor Liu nodded. “If Mr. Xiao Han can take the bezoar pill within three days, his chances of recovery will increase by at least 10% !” ”

“With doctor Liu’s words, Han Laoshan was relieved. He stood up and said, “Okay! I’ll do it right away. Thank you, Doctor Liu!” ”

Doctor Liu waved his hand.

...

“After leaving the Teahouse, Zhao Xueyin went straight back to the Zhao residence. ”

Father Zhao sat in the living room. “What did Han Luoshan Say?”

“”He said he wanted to consider it,”Zhao Xueyin said. ”

“Hearing this result, Father Zhao was not surprised. Instead, he said very calmly, “Then let’s wait.” ”

“Zhao Xueyin was a little worried. “Dad, what do you mean by Han Luoshan?” ”

“Don’t worry.”Father Zhao narrowed his eyes. “Few fathers would put their sons’lives at risk.”

“Moreover, Han Dongliang did not even leave behind an heir. How could Han Laoshan Watch Him Die? ”

Unless Han Laoshan wanted to watch the Han family rear up.

“Therefore, Father Zhao was not worried at all. ”

“To him, Han Laoshan was like a turtle in a jar! ”

There was no way for him to escape.

“Zhao Xueyin narrowed her eyes. “If Han Laoshan really cares about Han Dongliang, why would he still consider it?” ”

Didn’t normal people always agree to such a situation?

Han Laoshan’s reaction was a little strange.

“Father Zhao said, “Because he is not sure whether the an gong bezoar pill is really useful to Han Dongliang!” ”

“”Once he is sure that bezoar pill is useful to Han Dongliang, he will definitely contact you immediately.” ”

Zhao Xueyin nodded.

“At this moment, Zhao Xueyin’s phone suddenly rang. ”

Zhao Xueyin looked at Father Zhao. “It’s Han Laoshan Calling.”

“Pick up.”

Zhao Xueyin slid to pick up the call and pressed the speakerphone button.

“Han Laoshan’s voice came from the other end. “Xueyin, I have already thought about it! I agree with your plan. Don’t worry, when the day comes for the chief election, I will definitely get all the shareholders to vote for you!” ”

“The corners of Zhao Xueyin’s mouth curled up. “Uncle Han is a sensible person. In that case, I wish us a happy cooperation.” ”

“Han Laoshan continued, “Xueyin, currently, Dongliang’s physical condition is getting worse by the day. Xueyin, can you bring the bezoar pill over and let Dongliang use it first? I have asked the doctor. The Doctor said that using the bezoar pill now can increase the hope by at least 10% !” ”

“Hearing this, Zhao Xueyin turned to look at Father Zhao. ”

Father Zhao shook his head.

Let Han Dongliang use it now?

What a joke!

What if Han Dongliang used it now and it did not work?

The Bezoar Pill was not a godly medicine. It could cure all diseases.

“Even if it was a doctor, he could not guarantee that he could cure Han Dongliang 100% . ”

“Therefore, he had to wait until the election was over before he could give the Bezoar Pill to Han Laoshan. ”

“Zhao Xueyin also knew what Father Zhao meant and continued, “Uncle Han, I’m really sorry. This might not work. Don’t worry, after the election is over, I will definitely personally send the ox-bezoar pill to your house.” ”

“Han Laoshan was eager to save his son. When he heard Zhao Xueyin say no.., he immediately said, “Xueyin, your uncle Han has always kept his word! Don’t worry, as long as I get the ox-bezoar pill, no matter what the final outcome is, I will keep my promise and never go back on my words!” ”

“Zhao Xueyin said apologetically, “Uncle Han, you should know that the human heart can not withstand the test. I’m sorry.” ”

“Han Laoshan’s tone was close to begging, “Xueyin, even if Uncle Han is begging you, can you do it? If you don’t believe me, I can write a guarantee for you! I really have no other way. The Doctor said that now is the best time for treatment!” ”
