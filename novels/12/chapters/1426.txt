The nuclear reactor had malfunctioned.

“Hearing this, the faces of the four brothers, Cen Jiang, Cen he, Cen Hu, and Cen Hai turned pale and immediately ran over. ”

“The space mothership was different from other aircraft. Not only was it big, but it also had to reach the speed of light. It was definitely impossible to use ordinary fuel as the fuel for the flight. Therefore, the nuclear reactor was used as the fuel for the flight. ”

“The base had a large number of nuclear reactors. If there was a malfunction and the nuclear reactor leaked, a large amount of nuclear radiation would be produced. The consequences would be unimaginable! ”

“Cen Jiang turned to look at CEN he, Cen Hu, and Cen Hai. “The three of you go and help Zhou Gong. I’ll contact Miss Ye!” ”

“After saying that, CEN Jiang continued, “Put on the radiation-proof isolation suit!” ”

“”Got it. Go quickly!”Cen He, Cen Hu, and Cen Hai ran inside. As they ran, they grabbed the isolation suit on the side and put it on. ”

Cen Jiang quickly walked out of the construction warehouse.

“The three brothers walked inside. “What’s going on, Zhou? Isn’t the nuclear reactor always under special management?” ”

“I’m not very clear about the specific situation either! Have you contacted Miss Ye?”Zhou Dongyang asked.

“Dajiang has already contacted her.”

Zhou Dongyang nodded and picked up the communicator at the side. “Is Xiao Wang around?”

“”I’m here, Zhou Gong.” ”

“Zhou Dongyang continued, “Inform all the staff in Area C to immediately put on the radiation-proof isolation suit and prepare to evacuate at any time!” ”

“Alright! Arrange it immediately!”Xiao Wang replied.

“After instructing everyone to put on the isolation suit, Zhou Dongyang looked at the three brothers. “Erhe, Sanhu, Sihai, let’s go inside and take a look.” ”

“Okay.”The three brothers nodded.

On the other side of the base.

At the Tang family’s laboratory.

“Hearing the urgent alarm, Tang Xue stood up from her chair. “What’s going on?”She had stayed at the Cen family’s base for so many years, but this was the first time she had heard such an urgent alarm. ”

“It seems like there’s a problem with area c.”Xu Guo pushed the door open and walked in with the documents in her arms.

Large Area C?

Wasn’t large Area C ye Zao’s territory?

“Ever since the base established the aircraft carrier project, Large Area C had been assigned to Ye Zao to manage. ”

Large Area C occupied more than 100 mu.

“Before this, Tang Xue had been applying to Cen Shaoqing, hoping to get the authority to manage large area c. ”

“Moreover, in the entire base, other than Tang Jia, no one else had the qualifications to do so. ”

Who knew that ye Zhuo would appear out of thin air in the end!

Tang Xue narrowed her eyes. “What’s going on over there?”

“Xu Guo shook her head. “I heard them say that the alarm came from over there, but I’m not too sure what exactly happened. To sister Xue, this is the experiment report from last time. Take a look.” ”

“Tang Xue took the experiment report and was about to say something when the closed door was pushed open again. “Big News, Big News!” ”

“What happened to Xiao Lu?”Tang Xue put the experiment report aside and looked up at Xiao Lu.

“Xiao Lu clutched his chest and said breathlessly, “Do you know what happened outside? Why did the alarm sound?” ” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“”What’s wrong, what’s wrong! Tell me quickly! Don’t keep me in suspense!”Xu Guo was an impatient person. ”

“Xiao Lu took a deep breath, ”

“there was a gloating look on her face. “It’s the nuclear reactor at the aircraft carrier planning team that has malfunctioned!”Ever since Xiao Lu left the aircraft carrier planning team, she had been hoping for something to happen at Area C every day. ”

But this day had finally arrived!

“Hearing this, Tang Xue’s expression changed. “Nuclear reactor? Why would there be a nuclear reactor at their place?” ”

Nuclear reactors were also known as atomic reactors. They could maintain a controllable self-sustaining chain-type nuclear fission reaction to realize the use of nuclear energy.

“At present, there were very few people in China who could truly master nuclear reactor technology. Once the operation went wrong, it would cause destructive damage. ”

Who would have thought that ye Zao would actually dare to store a nuclear reactor in the base.

Wasn’t this a joke to everyone in the base?

“Xiao Lu said, “Sister Xue, don’t you know? Ye Zao is going to use a nuclear reactor as the power raw material for an aircraft carrier!” ”

“”Use a nuclear reactor as the raw material? Is she crazy?”Under normal circumstances, an aircraft carrier would use fuel oil or nuclear power as the power raw material. Who would have thought that ye Zao would actually use a nuclear reactor! ”

Was she dreaming?

“Tang Xue frowned, her face full of worry. “Are you sure that she’s going to use a nuclear reactor as the raw material?” ”

“Xiao Lu nodded, “We all had training when we joined. Ye Zao did use a nuclear reactor as raw material for power. It was said that many people were against ye Zao at that time, but in the end, they all gave up. I didn’t expect that something would happen this time!” ”
