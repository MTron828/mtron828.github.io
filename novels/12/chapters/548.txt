A slender girl was sitting at the desk by the window.

“She was wearing white silk pajamas and holding a pencil in her hand. She was drawing something on the design draft with her eyebrows lowered. As long as she raised her eyes slightly, she would be able to see a crescent moon hanging in the sky outside the window. ”

The bright moonlight shone through the glass window and coated her body with a layer of clear light.

A moment later.

“She put down the pen in her hand, stretched, and opened the laptop. Her jade-white fingertips formed a sharp contrast with the black keyboard. Before long, the room was filled with the sound of clacking keyboards. ”

“Although there were some clues about the incident that happened in the 19th year at the Yun Jing women and Children’s Hospital, it was still very vague so far. ”

“First, it had been too long. ”

“Second, the surveillance system had not been completely perfected, and some cities had not even popularized surveillance. ”

“Third, the medical staff of that year had basically all retired. ”

“Ye Zhuo frowned slightly. Although it would be difficult to investigate all the things that had happened back then, she did not want to give up just like that. ”

She had to take it slow.

She looked forward to the day when she would uncover the truth layer by layer.

“After turning off the sky eye system, Ye Zao entered Feng Qianhua’s name into the search engine. ”

...

The next morning.

Ye Zao got up on time to run.

“The Morning Air was very good, and there were birds chirping and flowers in the backyard. ”

Ye Zao ran around once and saw Lin Qingxuan come out to run as well.

“”Good morning, fourth uncle.” ” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Although Zhao Shuning wasn’t a good person, ye Zhuo had a good impression of Lin Qingxuan as his fourth uncle. ”

“He had just talked about ye Shu behind his back last night. Now that he saw ye Zhuo, Lin Qingxuan felt a little guilty. “Good morning, Zhuo Zhuo. Did you come out to run too?” ”

“”Yes, fourth uncle.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. His gaze swept past Lin Qingxuan’s face without leaving a trace. ”

This was...

BEATEN?

“Cough Cough!”

A cough came from behind.

“An unnatural expression flashed across Lin Qingxuan’s face. “Zao Zao, I went over there to run.” ”

“Okay.”

“After Lin Qingxuan left, Ye Zao looked back. ”

He saw Zhao shuning walking over from the side.

Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly.

He didn’t expect Lin Qingxuan to be afraid of his wife.

“Zhao shuning smiled. “Zao Zao, come out for a run!” ”

“”Fourth aunt,”ye Zao called out politely. ”

But that was only limited to politeness.

She really didn’t have a good impression of this fourth aunt.

Zhao shuning’s gaze swept past ye Zao.

Whether it was in terms of image or temperament.

“In the entire capital, there was probably no one else who could do that. ”

“Such a good-looking face, how could she give birth to this wild lass just like that? ”

Zhao shuning’s eyes flashed with disgust.

If Lin Qingxuan could give birth...

The daughter she gave birth to would definitely be ten thousand times more beautiful than this wild girl!

What was this wild girl?

“Looking at ye Zao, Zhao Shuning narrowed his eyes, the corners of his mouth still maintaining a smile. “Zao Zao, do you have a boyfriend?” ”

“”This has nothing to do with you,”ye Zao continued, “I still have to run, so I won’t chat with you.” ”

Zhao shuning’s smile froze at the corner of her mouth.

A wild girl was indeed a wild girl!

She didn’t have any manners at all!

Did she really put fourth aunt in her eyes?

Zhao shuning looked at ye Zhuo’s back and gnashed her teeth. She wanted nothing more than to eat ye Zhuo!

“After the run, they went back. ”

Lin Jincheng was already arranging breakfast.

“The Lin family’s manor was very large. Ever since ye Shu returned, Lin Jincheng had led a family of four to live in the east courtyard. Their clothes, food, accommodation, and travel were all separated from Old Lady Lin. ”

“”Zhonghua, it’s time to eat.” ”

“I’ll go up and wash my face first.”

“Okay.”Lin Jincheng nodded.

“By the time ye Zhonghua finished washing his face and went downstairs, Ye Shu and Lin Ze were already sitting at the dining table. ”

Ye Zhonghua walked over to Lin Ze and sat down.

“Lin Ze picked up the peeled eggs and placed them into ye Zhonghua’s bowl. Then, he served ye Zhonghua with porridge. ”

“Seeing how little affection the two siblings had for each other, Ye Shu felt very gratified. ”

At first.

Ye Shu was still worried that the two children would not get along.

“”There’s too much. I’ll make some for you.”Ye Zhuo did not eat much for breakfast, but she did not have the habit of wasting food, so she could only give the extra porridge in her bowl to Lin Ze. ”

“Lin Jincheng was about to say that Lin ze did not like eight treasures porridge, but Lin ze actually nodded and said yes. ”

This made Lin Jincheng stunned.

It seemed that there were still many similarities between them.

“Ye Zhuo took a bite of the egg and continued, “Dad, does fourth uncle and fourth aunt not have children?” ”

Lin Jincheng nodded. “Yes.”

“Fourth aunt doesn’t have the ability to give birth?”Ye Zhuo continued to ask.

“Lin Jincheng said in surprise, “You can even tell that? Right, aren’t you skilled in medicine, Zhuo Zhuo? Is there any way to make your fourth aunt pregnant?” ”
