“Chapter 1213: 257: Face slapping, she was the target of everyone’s expectations. Zhao Xueyin was dumbfounded! 1”

“Needless to say, Han Laoshan must be very regretful now. ”

“After all, he was the one who killed his own son! ”

“If he did not believe in ye Zhuo, Han Dongliang would not have died. ”

It was a pity.

It was too late to regret now!

“In this world, there was everything except regret. ”

“Zhao Xueyin looked at Han Laoshan, her eyes filled with joy. ”

“Now that Han Dongliang was in trouble, would Han Laoshan still choose ye Zao? ”

Of course not!

“Not only would ye Zao not be able to run for the chief seat, he would also be imprisoned! ”

“In the future, no one would be able to take away her things! ”

This was ye Zao’s retribution!

“After waiting for so long, Ye Zao finally got his retribution. ”

The smug look in Zhao Xueyin’s eyes was almost overflowing.

“After a while, Zhao Xueyin looked at Han Laoshan who was sitting on the ground and crying bitterly. She turned around and walked out of the door. ”

11 am.

The chief election meeting officially began.

“Han Laoshan was the last to arrive. Although he tried his best to hide his emotions, his eyes were still very red. ”

One look and one would know that he had cried.

When she saw Han Laoshan enter.

Zhao Xueyin narrowed her eyes.

It seemed that Han Dongliang was not dead.

“If Han Dongliang was dead, Han Laoshan would not be able to attend the election. ”

“However, even if Han Dongliang was lucky enough not to die, he was probably only left with his last breath. ”

“Otherwise, Han Laoshan would not be so depressed. ”

It seemed that Han Dongliang’s life would have to be continued with an Gong Niu Huang Wan.

“A moment later, Zhao Xueyin retracted her gaze. ”

“At this time, Han Laoshan also walked to his seat and sat down. He had a discussion with a few shareholders. ”

“After a while of discussion, elder Zhang stood up and said, “Since everyone is here, I now announce that the third chief election is starting now! This vote concerns the future of the Shunxi Financial Group. I hope that all shareholders will be cautious!” ”

“As soon as he finished speaking, the meeting room fell into a strange silence. ”

“”Now, let’s invite President Ye and Miss Zhao to speak.” ”

Ye Zhuo and Zhao Xueyin sat opposite each other.

“After the two of them exchanged some pleasantries, the shareholders began to vote. ”

“I support President Ye.”

“I support Miss Zhao.”

“...”

“A few minutes later, the big screen showed the votes of the two people. ”

Ye Zhuo had 16 votes. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Zhao Xueyin also had 16 votes.

“At the moment, the two people were evenly matched. ”

“If they wanted to determine the winner, it would still depend on the crucial vote in Han Laoshan’s hands. ”

“Once Han Laoshan cast his vote, the shareholders behind him would also follow Han Laoshan to vote. ”

“For a moment, everyone turned to look at Han Laoshan. ”

The atmosphere was a little tense.

Who Would Han Laoshan choose?

Zhao Xueyin?

Ye Zhuo?

Who would be able to sit in the first seat? !

“Just as everyone was waiting for Han Laoshan to vote, Han Laoshan did not make his next move. ”

Anyone with a discerning eye could see that he was hesitating.

“The crowd below the stage discussed animatedly, unable to guess Han Laoshan’s intentions. ”

“Elder Zhang turned to look at Han Laoshan and said in a low voice, “Old Han, what’s wrong with you? Didn’t we agree to vote for searing?” ”

Han Laoshan moved his lips but didn’t say anything in the end.

“Zhao Xueyin looked at elder Zhang with a mocking look in her eyes. After a moment, she said calmly, “Elder Zhang, you don’t have to make unnecessary decisions for Uncle Han. I believe that Uncle Han will make the best choice!” ”

“Speaking up to this point, Zhao Xueyin looked at Han Laoshan. “Uncle Han, am I right?” ”

Han Lao Shan still didn’t say anything.

“Hearing this, elder Zhang turned to look at Zhao Xue Yin. ”

He felt that something wasn’t right.

“He had clearly discussed with Han Lao Shan half a month ago, and Han Lao Shan had made it clear that he would bring the shareholders to vote for Ye Zhuo. ”

But now... Han Lao Shan was actually hesitating!

What was he hesitating about?

“Elder Zhang frowned, very worried. ”

“Although Han Laoshan did not answer Zhao Xueyin, she was not worried at all. ”

Because Han Laoshan had to choose her.

Unless...

Han Laoshan wanted to watch Han Dongliang Die!

But could Han Laoshan Watch Han Dongliang Die?

Han Dongliang was Han Laoshan’s only son!

Zhao Xueyin’s eyes were full of determination.

“At this moment, Han Laoshan stood up and turned to look at Zhao Xueyin. ”

Zhao Xueyin smiled.

At least Han Laoshan had good eyesight.

“After a while, Han Laoshan slowly opened his mouth and said word by word, “I support President Ye!” ”

Support Ye Zhuo?

“Zhao Xueyin, who had already stood up from her seat, turned pale. ”

Auditory hallucination.

It must be an auditory hallucination.

How could Han Laoshan Support Ye Zao?
