“[ did you guys notice that Yezi’s hands have blisters from the sharpening of the knife, but she didn’t act as miserably as song Chenyu. ] ”

“[ the one above, I specially paused to take a look. Yezi’s hands did indeed have two large blisters from the sharpening. ] ” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

[ I saw it too. ]

[ little Missy’s spirit is worthy of praise. ]

“[ emmm, drawing such a comparison makes the drawing next door easier. ] ”

“After cutting the grass, they went to pick the watermelon. ”

“When everyone saw that song Chenyu refused to go back to rest and insisted on carrying the watermelon with injuries, the bullet screen became unstable again. [ my heart aches for Chenyu. ] ”

“[ Chenyu, you’ve worked hard. ] ”

[ Chenyu has really done a lot for team blue. ]

“[ previously, there were still anti-fans who criticized Chenyu for being lazy. If Chenyu was really lazy, she wouldn’t have moved the watermelon with everyone. ] ”

“Looking at Team Red, Wei Xingzhi and Chang Yu only casually told ye Zao to go back and rest. Ye Zao actually went back to rest. ”

And she left without looking back.

[ does this internet celebrity have no brain? Can’t she see that everyone is busy? ]

“[ this is a little ruining the relationship of the passers-by! which one of the people present isn’t her senior? Senior didn’t even go back to rest, yet she actually went back... I’m really drunk. -RSB- ”

[ does this person have no Eq? ]

[ I had a pretty good impression of her when I was mowing the grass just now. Now... I take back what I said just now. ]

“Seeing this, Cen Yuyan felt extremely happy in her heart. ”

Ye Zhuo was finally ridiculed by the group.

“Old Mrs. Cen looked at the words on the bullet screen and was so angry that her face turned pale, “Our Yezi worked so hard when she was cutting the grass just now. Almost two-thirds of the grass was cut by her! What’s wrong with going back to rest? What right do these people have to point at us?” ”

“”Grandma, don’t be angry. Let’s continue reading.”Cen Yuyan suppressed the smug look in her eyes and pretended to persuade Old Mrs. Cen. ”

The program team did not cut in the process of Ye Zhuo borrowing the tractor.

“The scene changed, and Yin Wei looked at the tractor that was approaching not far away in surprise. ”

[ F * ck! F * ck! ]

[ did little Missy drive the tractor over? ]

[666666! ]

[ what kind of fairy little Missy is this? ]

[ I fell in love. ]

[ she is clearly driving the tractor. Why Do I Feel Like Little Missy is riding a big horse? ]

“[ oh my God, she’s So Handsome! ] ”

[ I’m going to Miao Yin to pay attention to her! ]

[ add one on Top! ]

[ add two! ]

The netizens who were originally disgusted with Ye Zhuo became happy one after another.

Ye Zhuo stopped the tractor and moved the watermelons onto the tractor with everyone else.

[ she really looks like a Hercules. ]

“[ hahaha, teacher Wei and Chang Yu are both stunned. ] ”

“Seeing this, old Mrs. Cen was also overjoyed. “My granddaughter-in-law is really amazing! She can actually drive a tractor! weren’t they just slacking off with ye Zao? Now they’ve been slapped in the face!” ”

“Ye Zao is so amazing!”

The Cen sisters were also extremely surprised.

The smile on Cen Yuyan’s face was slowly disappearing.

She didn’t expect things to turn out this way.

She also didn’t expect ye Zhuo to know how to drive a tractor.

Ah!

“At this moment, Yin Wei’s scream suddenly appeared on the television. ”

She had encountered the cauliflower snake.

“When Chang Yu ran over, he was already shocked. ”

“At this moment, a figure walked over and calmly grabbed the cauliflower snake on the ground. ”

The program team even added a ‘hero of the world’special effect on her back.

[ F * ck! Am I seeing things? ]

[ catching a snake with your bare hands? ]

[ little sister is really amazing! ]

[ she can drive a tractor and catch snakes! I love this little sister. ]

[ this boyfriend strength is simply too strong! ]

“[ I was so handsome that I cried. My boyfriend didn’t cry, and then I beat him until he cried. ] ”

[ such a fairy lady is really in love. ]

[ oh my God! I really like leaf! ]

“The red team easily pulled the watermelon back and went to the fish pond to fish. Then, they saw that the red team was still working hard to move the watermelon. ”

“After returning from fishing in the fish pond, ye Zhuo took the fish to return the tractor to the uncle. ”

[ leaf is really polite. ]

[ the uncle and aunt are also very warm! ]

[ leaf is really a treasure. ]

“[ the red team is about to cook, while the blue team is still moving the watermelons. ] ”

“[ actually, they can also borrow the tractor, but unfortunately, no one knows how to drive it. ] ”

“Then, the camera switched to Ye Zao’s cooking scene. ”
