It’s impossible!

“Thinking of this, Dr. Karla was extremely excited. ”

A few hours later.

The major news sections broke even bigger news.

The matter of Grandma or granddaughter was a conspiracy!

There was an even bigger mastermind behind this.

“And this person was the famous aircraft carrier manufacturer, Dr. YC! ”

“When this news came out, the entire Internet was shocked. ”

“No way! Our Dr. YC is not that kind of person! I don’t Believe It!”

“Spreading rumors is against the law.”

“”Is there something wrong with the informant? Why did Dr. YC poison two ordinary people? Could it be for money? I said Dr. YC is as rich as a country, none of you would object!” ”

“In other words, Ye Zao had no motive at all. ”

Could it be that she would poison two people because of money?

“[ Dr. YC is indeed great and has contributed a lot to mankind. But if this is true, I hope that Dr. YC will be punished by the law. Life for life. After all, life does not differentiate between nobility and inferiority. The lives of ordinary people are also life! Just because she was a doctor and had made contributions to mankind, she could not let it go and let it go! Let the Dead Rest in peace ”

“Two lives! The authorities are really bad. Why didn’t they suppress such news? Now that the matter has become so big, even if the authorities wanted to protect YC, they would not be able to do so ”

“So, it’s better now. If it were in the past, these grandparents and grandchildren would have died in vain ”

“[ so, why did Dr. YC poison them? ] ”

“At this moment, the informant released a video of Feng Shujing going to the CEN family base to look for ye Zhuo before she passed away. ”

Dr. Cara spent a lot of money to buy this video.

“In addition, someone also revealed the matter of Feng Shujing’s daughter, Feng Qi. Feng Qi used to be a member of the Cen family base, but he later betrayed them! ”

“However, after Feng Shu passed away, the person who helped Feng Shu deal with her funeral was actually ye Zao. ”

“Feng Qi betrayed ye Zao and the Cen family base, but in the end, the person who helped Feng Qi’s mother deal with her funeral turned out to be ye Zao. This was too unbelievable! ”

A normal person wouldn’t do such a thing!

“Afterwards, the informant revealed news about the jade. ”

“It was said that the Feng family had a piece of jade that was passed down from generation to generation and was of great value for scientific research. Ever since the Feng family’s grandfather and grandson were poisoned to death, the Jade had disappeared! ”

It was obvious that the Jade was stolen by someone.

“With all the evidence from the informant, the person who stole the jade and poisoned the grandfather and grandson was obviously ye Zhuo. ”

Ye Zhuo was trying to destroy the evidence and create the illusion that the old lady had poisoned her granddaughter.

“For a moment, the entire internet was in an uproar. ”

Even foreign netizens climbed over the wall to chase after ye Zao and Curse!

“That was two lives, and Ye Zao’s methods were so cruel. After that, he even blamed all the crimes on the old lady, making the old lady bear this injustice for nothing. ” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

[ YC’s actions have really broadened my horizons! ]

[ those were two lives. are the Chinese police really not going to do anything? ]

“”I’m sorry, I apologize to Grandma. I wronged Grandma earlier. The real murderer is still standing in the sunlight and smiling!” ”

“”The Chinese police are really disappointing!”The comments below were a mess of people, which made the matter even more heated. ”

The internet trolls deliberately stirred up the emotions of the people. They led everyone and started to attack the Chinese police. Tens of thousands of people wrote blood letters requesting the arrest of Ye Zhuo. There were even people who held high the protest flag in front of the Supreme People’s court.

Ye Zao flipped through the news calmly. She looked indifferent as if she was just a bystander.

“From the moment this matter came out, she knew who was behind it. ”

“She originally wanted to spare Carla’s dog life, but unfortunately, the other party did not understand the value of life at all. ”

In the office on the other side.

“Cen Shaoqing sat in front of his desk and gently tapped the table with his hand that was holding the Buddha bead. After a moment, he looked up at his assistant. “Carla, right?” ”

“”Yes, Master Five.” ”

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips parted slightly.

Yes?

“The assistant was stunned. Ever since Cen Shaoqing met ye Zao, he rarely said these two words, causing Cen Shaoqing to say these two words again. The assistant’s face was filled with shock. ”

“You don’t understand what I’m saying?”Cen Shaoqing raised his eyes slightly.

“Only then did the assistant react. His heart trembled and he immediately said, “Master Five, I’m sorry. I’ll immediately arrange for someone to handle it.” ”

Cen Shaoqing waved his hand and the assistant left the office.

“After thinking for a while, Cen Shaoqing was still a little worried. He twirled the Buddha beads, stood up from his chair, and walked towards Ye Zhuo’s office. ”
