Chapter 135: 083: torturing scum, satisfying the hearts of the people! Great Maternal Love 1

It was a very soft voice, but it was loud and powerful.

Everyone looked towards the door.

They saw a slender voice walking in from the door.

On a cold winter day, she was wearing a thin white hoodie, black pants, and a pair of white sports shoes, which made her legs look extremely slender. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Her face was obviously not made up, but it was breathtakingly beautiful.

When she saw ye Zao, Ye Shu’s heart instantly calmed down. She said to Ye Dafu with a cold face, “Zao Zao is right. I have long broken off relations with you. My family does not welcome you. Please leave immediately!”

“B * Tch! What did you say?”Ye Dafu slammed the table and stood up, glaring at ye Shu fiercely.

Lin Xiaowei was a smart person. They came here today to ask for money from ye Shu. Their relationship couldn’t be too bad, so they tried to smooth things over with a smile, “Dad, don’t be angry. Xiaoshu didn’t mean that. She’s your biological daughter. Her bones are broken and her tendons are still attached. How could she sever her relationship with you guys? !”

After saying that, Lin Xiaowei looked at ye Shu again, “Shu!”! What happened at Big Sis’House last time was all a misunderstanding. At that time, everyone was angry, so they spoke out in anger. They didn’t really want to sever their relationship with you. You mustn’t take it seriously! Didn’t mom and Dad bring your brother and I here today to apologize to you? As children, we should respect filial piety. How could we really be angry with our parents? This is a lightning strike! Shu, sister-in-law knows that you are definitely not that kind of person!”

“Moreover, our parents, your brother and I have always been thinking about you and searing. Look, we know that you like to eat peanut butter. We specially bought this for you.”

Lin Xiaowei was indeed a cultured person.

After such a long speech, she did not even gasp for breath.

Not only did she ingratiate herself with Ye Shu, but she also did not forget to remind her to be filial to her parents.

A good daughter, no matter what her parents did, she could not be angry with them.

This was filial piety.

Ye Shu frowned tightly.

She had always been a person who was not good with words. A word of filial piety could crush a person to death... ...

Lin Xiaowei’s words had indeed grasped her weak spot.

For a moment, she did not know what to do.

Ye Zao smiled and continued, “If you really miss my mother, why didn’t you come to visit my mother once when we were still living in the basement? “For a full 18 years, even Grandma Liu, who lived next door to us, thought that my mother was an orphan whose parents had both died! “Now that our days are better, who are you going to disgust by carrying a bag of expired peanut butter?”

Now, not only had ye Shu opened three restaurants, but he had also moved out from the basement. His days were getting more and more prosperous, and these people could not sit still.

They did not even think about how ye Shu had humiliated ye Shuang’s family that day!

Ye Zao had lived for two lifetimes. What kind of person had he not seen?

This was the first time he had seen such a shameless person!

Upon hearing this, an awkward expression flashed across Lin Xiaowei’s face.

The peanut butter they had brought over had indeed expired. Initially, they had only wanted to fool ye Shu, but they had not expected ye Zhuo’s eyes to be so good.

Even from so far away, she had already seen that the peanut butter had expired.

“No, Zhuo Zhuo, you’ve misunderstood!”Lin Xiaowei continued, “This peanut butter is something that your uncle and I have always been reluctant to eat. We wanted to save it and bring it over for your mother to eat! Who would have thought that it would expire right after it was released! It’s said that a gift from a thousand miles away is light, but it means a lot. This peanut butter is the same. This peanut butter represents our friendship to your mother.”

A peanut butter that had expired was said by Lin Xiaowei to be a friendship that was worth thousands of gold coins.

Ordinary people really didn’t have such eloquence.

Ye searing curled his lips slightly. “A tree without skin will die without a doubt. A person without face is invincible in the world! We can’t accept such a precious friendship! The door is over there. Please leave immediately! You are not welcome in our home!”

“Ye Shu! Is this how you Teach Your Daughter?”Ye Shuai slammed the table and stood up in anger.

Ye Zhuo raised his head to look at Ye Shuai. “This is my house. How My mother teaches her daughter has nothing to do with you. Who Do you think you are?”

“Little B * Tch! Is this how you talk to your uncle? I Can’t beat you to death today, you little B * Tch!”Yao Cui Fen jumped up, she casually picked up the feather duster on the side and was about to hit ye Zao, “Little B * Tch! Your Mother didn’t teach you how to behave! Today, I will teach you how to behave on behalf of your mother! If you don’t apologize to your Uncle Today, I will beat you to death!”
