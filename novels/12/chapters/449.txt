Translator: 549690339

“”I know! In the end, Miss Qianhua is too soft-hearted...”Zhang Sao echoed. ”

...

On the other side.

“After ye Zhuo and Li Yueyue finished their dinner, they returned to the dormitory. ”

“Ye Zhuo, an Lizi, and Zhao Pingting were watching a video together. ”

“Although it had only been a day, an Lizi and Zhao Pingting’s skin had obviously darkened by a degree. ”

“After chatting, Ye Zhuo turned on his computer and started working on the management company. ”

The company was already registered —

“Xing Tianxia Culture Co. , Ltd. . ”

“As soon as he turned on his computer, he received a message from his partner, Li Shang. ”

“Li Shang was previously the CEO of Dazhuan culture, and he had started from nothing with his partner, Zhao Jianghe. ”

It was a pity.

“There was no room for two Tigers on the same mountain. As Dazhuan culture climbed higher and higher, Li Shang’s abilities became stronger and stronger. Zhao Jianghe also became more and more fearful of Li Shang, so he used methods to take away the real power in Li Shang’s hands. He then tried to frame Li Shang again, step by step, he chased Li Shang out of the great legend culture. ”

Ye Zhuo opened the message that Li Shang had sent him.

Li Shang: [ the location of the company has already been decided. When will you have the time to come over and take a look? ]

“Bei Feng: [ no need, as long as you think it’s fine. ] ”

Li Shang: [ ? ? ? ]

Were all rich people nowadays so willful?

This partner called ‘bei Feng Qi tie’had only chatted with him online for a few days before sending a huge sum of money into his account.

“The two of them had not even met formally before. He did not even know bei Feng Qi Zhen’s real name, whether it was a man or a woman... ”

Was bei Feng Qi Zhen not afraid that he would run away with the money?

“However, the other party seemed to have seen through Li Shang’s worries as he sent a message over. [ don’t worry, you won’t be able to run away. ] ”

Li Shang clicked on the three pictures and was immediately stunned. His face turned pale.

“The first picture showed his household registration address and current address. Below that was the record of his departure during this period, and even the detailed address of his departure. ”

“The second picture showed all the asset certificates under his name, as well as his previous employment experience. ”

“The third picture showed the status of his family members, and even where his children went to school. It was clearly marked. ”

This was too terrifying!

Who was the other party?

Why could he check his privacy so thoroughly.

Li Shang gulped.

“At this moment, the other party sent another message: [ don’t worry, I’m not a liar, and I’m not Zhao Jianghe! Also, the contract is very clear. I’ll pay, you’ll contribute, and you’ll have 10% of the shares. ] ”

“[ if you regret it, it’s still not too late. ] ”

Only then did Li Shang react. He hurriedly sent a message over. [ no! I don’t regret it! ]

“Back then, when Bei Feng had finally found him, he had been at the most lost in his life. ”

He was over 40 years old and had suddenly lost his job. He still had a wife and children at home to support him.

Li Shang had been working in the media industry for ten years.

“Apart from the media industry, he knew nothing and knew nothing. ”

“However, the requirements for those companies were particularly high. They required a high degree, and some of them even imported talents directly from abroad. ”

“Other than the ten years of work experience, Li Shang had no degree and no connections. He could not find any good jobs at all. ”

“Helpless, he could only post job applications online. ”

Who would have thought that someone would actually come looking for him.

“Just as Li Shang thought that the other party was making fun of him, a few days later, he received a bank transfer message. ” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“When he opened it, he was completely dumbfounded. ”

Only then did he realize that the other party was not joking with him.

“Bei Feng: [ Oh Right, Sitara YC’s Ye is our company’s first signed streamer. Please get your marketing account to send out the release as soon as possible. ] ”

“Seeing this news, Li Shang was completely stunned. ”

“Sitara YC’s Ye had already debuted for more than a year, and had become a hot topic on all the short video platforms. All the big companies had extended an olive branch to her, and even the culture that Li Shang was previously in wanted to sign with her, but Sitara YC’s Ye had rejected it. ”

“Originally, Li Shang was still worried. Their company had just debuted, so there was no way they could sign with any popular streamer. They could only rely on nurturing new people to develop their influence. ”

He did not expect that the boss whom he had never met before would actually sign a contract with Sitara YC’s Ye!

“With Sitara’s live traffic, why would he need to worry about the company’s lack of popularity? ”

“While he was shocked, Li Shang was still a little worried that ye Zhuo was looking for him to be happy, so he turned on melody and searched for Sitara YC’s Ye. ”

“When he opened Sitara YC’s Ye’s personal information, he saw the column marked on his personal information: [ Xing Tian Xia Culture Co. , Ltd. has signed a contract with a streamer. ] ”
