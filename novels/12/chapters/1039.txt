“Elder Zhang originally wanted ye Langhua to return to the sovereignty, but ye Langhua said this instead.”

“Hearing this, elder Zhang’s face was filled with loneliness.”

“Just as elder Zhang was at a loss, ye Langhua continued, “Elder Zhang, what do you think of Searing Flame?””

“Elder zhang said bluntly, “Compared to you back then, she’s a notch above you!””

Elder Zhang had witnessed ye Zao’s ability.

“Although she was young, her horizons, knowledge, and achievements were not even comparable to ye Langhua back then!”

“Elder Zhang had not been able to find any results from his investigation of the incident 36 years ago for a long time, but in ye Zao’s hands, he had managed to find out everything in less than three days. From this, one could see ye Zao’s true strength”

“Ye Langhua nodded with a smile and continued, “So, I want to make Zao My Father’s successor. What do you think?””

“”Of course it’s Great!”Elder Zhang’s eyes lit up. In fact, elder Zhang had already had this idea, but he was too embarrassed to say it out loud.”

“With ye Zao’s methods, as long as she agreed to join the Shunxi Financial Group, how could the Zhao family have any say in it?”

Elder Zhang seemed to have seen the scene when ye Zao joined the Shunxi Financial Group!

“Ye Langhua said, “Then it’s settled. However, I still have to go back and discuss it with Zao.”Taking over the Shunxi Financial Group was not a small matter, and ye Zao had to agree to it himself.”

“Okay.”Elder Zhang nodded. “Then I’ll wait for Your Good News.”

“En.”

“After elder Zhang left, ye Langhua got someone to draft a document and then returned to the Lin family.”

The Lin family was very lively today.

“Ye Langhua and ye Shu introduced themselves as mother and daughter, and Lin Jincheng invited the four brothers of the Lin family back.”

Cen Shaoqing and the Cen family also came.

“Old Mrs. Cen sighed, “Ah Shu, I really didn’t expect you to be Langhua’s daughter!””

“Because she was more than 20 years older than ye Langhua, old Mrs. Cen always liked to call ye Langhua ‘Little Langhua’in the past. Now that ye Langhua had become ye Shu’s mother, if she were to call ye Langhua ‘Little Langhua’again.., it would be a little inappropriate.”

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “It’s not just you. Even I feel like I’m Dreaming.””

“Until now, Ye Shu still felt that all of this was very unreal.”

“Seeing ye Langhua come over, Old Madam Cen smiled and said, “Langhua! You’re considered to be perfect now! You’ve got such a good daughter, and you’ve also got a pair of outstanding grandchildren!””

“Ye Langhua was also full of smiles as she continued to say, “Shaoqing isn’t Here?””

“Old Madam Cen said, “He’s Here! How can he not come on such a joyous day! Look at where Ye Zi is, he should be there.””

Ye Langhua nodded.

On the third floor.

Ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing were discussing the issue of the space mothership in the room.

“One would not know if they did not discuss it. When they discussed it, Ye Zhuo was shocked to discover that no country in this world had ever created a real space mothership.”

Even the most technologically advanced country C was only at the theoretical design stage.

“Ye Zao said, “Is it difficult to create an aircraft carrier?””

“Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads. “First of all, putting aside the expensive cost, an aircraft carrier is a huge carrier. It’s impossible to achieve it floating on the sea, let alone flying in the air!””

“”It’s very easy to fly,”ye Zao said indifferently. “All you need to do is strengthen the propulsion system and the coordinated control system. What’s so difficult about that?””

Cen Shaoqing was stunned.

He was very curious about what was going on in this person’s mind. Why was he able to speak so casually?

Strengthen the propulsion system and the coordinated control system? Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

An aircraft carrier was a huge fighter plane. It was heavier than a mountain. How powerful was the propulsion system and the coordinated control system to make it fly?

“Just as Cen Shaoqing was puzzled, ye Zhuo continued, “The problem of cost is even easier to solve. As long as it is reasonably designed and does not waste materials, we can save a lot of money by using the recycling system.””

“Cen Shaoqing continued to twirl the Buddha beads, “Then how can we solve the safety problem? The radar reflection area of the space mothership in the air is very large, and it is easy for the enemy to find it. Once it is found, it will be destroyed by anti-aircraft missiles. At that time, the loss outweighs the gain!”Actually, this was also the real reason why many countries were unable to develop a space mothership!”

“If the problem of defense was not solved properly, even if it really flew into the sky, it would be destroyed in a second or something.”

The aircraft carrier was huge. There was no way for it to avoid the missiles. It could only rely on its own defense system
