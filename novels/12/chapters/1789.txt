“What happened? Tell me slowly.”Ye Zhuo looked back slightly.

“The assistant continued, “Team leader Yu has gone missing.” ”

“Yu Zifei?”He ziteng asked.

“”Yes, president he,”the assistant replied. ”

“Mars was, after all, outer space. Under normal circumstances, there were only two possibilities for Yu Zifei to go missing on Mars. ”

The first possibility was that he had been hijacked by an alien creature.

The second possibility was that the spacecraft had failed.

“Regardless of the above possibilities, it was very dangerous for Yu Zifei. He had to get in touch with Yu Zifei immediately. ”

Ye Zhuo frowned slightly. “Get Ready. We’ll set off for Mars immediately.”

“Okay.”The assistant nodded.

“He ziteng said, “Fifth sister-in-law, I’ll go with you.” ”

“Okay.”

“I’ll go change into my spacesuit first.”He ziteng walked to the lounge to change his clothes.

The assistant went to start the aircraft.

“Ten minutes later, Ye Zhuo and he ziteng arrived on the aircraft. ”

“Although this aircraft was only one percent the size of an aircraft carrier, its speed was not inferior to that of an aircraft carrier. It could seat 100 people. ”

“About 40 minutes later, the aircraft arrived on Mars. ”

“CEN he immediately greeted, “Miss Ye.” ”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “What happened?”

“CEN he said, “At 8:30 in the morning, Old Yu said that he was going to the west to investigate. After 10 o’clock, we couldn’t contact him! I went to the west to look for him twice, but I still couldn’t find him! Currently, Cen Hu is still in the west.” ”

“He ziteng said, “Was Yu Zifei the only one who went there?” ”

“”His assistant was with him,”cen he said. ”

“Is there no response from the Locator?”Ye Zhuo turned to look at CEN he.

“”No.”This was also what Cen he was most worried about. At the moment, he could no longer find the location of Yu Zifei on Mars. ”

It was as if Yu Zifei and his assistant did not exist at all.

“Have you notified their families?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“Not yet.”Cen he shook his head. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Ye Zhuo said as he walked towards the Mars base, “Don’t notify them for now, in case their families get anxious.” ”

“”Yes, Miss Ye.”Cen he had been extremely anxious ever since Yu Zifei disappeared. Seeing ye Zhuo now, Cen he felt as if he had been reassured. ”

“The few of them came to the base. In the tracking room, a few experts who were good at positioning were already studying the possibility that Yu Zifei’s aircraft would stop there. ”

“How’s the investigation going?”Ye Zhuo walked over.

“One of the experts shook his head. “The last place that team leader Yu passed by was here. There’s a crater a hundred meters deep here, but our people have searched around several times, but haven’t found any remains of the aircraft.” ”

Ye Zhuo took the controller from his hand and kept changing the computer screen.

“Although the screen changed very quickly, she didn’t even frown. After a while, she pointed to a location and said, “Have you looked here?” ”

“The expert said, “This place is not in the same direction as the crater. Team leader Yu’s aircraft probably won’t pass through here.” ”

...

On the other side.

Yu Zifei dragged his heavy steps and walked in a barren desert area on Mars.

“The wind was raging, and the ground was covered in dust. The visibility was less than two meters, and the weather was unimaginably bad. ”

“When he was inspecting the western region, the aircraft was suddenly attacked by an unknown object, and then the aircraft exploded. If he hadn’t jumped quickly, he probably wouldn’t have been able to find the remaining human tissue. ”

“After he jumped off the aircraft, he lost consciousness. When he woke up again, he was already here. ”

“What made Yu Zifei feel the most despair was that this place was a hemisphere away from the base. He did not have a communication device, and the only locator was broken. If he did not contact the base within three hours.., he would die on Mars! ”

He was not afraid of death.

“The only thing he was worried about was his elderly parents. He was the only son in the family. If something happened to him, how would his parents survive? ”

“Thinking of his parents, Yu Zifei sighed. ”

Survive.

He had to survive.

“As Yu Zifei walked forward, he called the little assistant’s name, “Li Xiang! Li Xiang!” ”

“At that time, he and the little assistant had jumped into the flying machine together. ”

“He had fallen here, so the little assistant should not be far from here. ”

“Unfortunately, Yu Zifei had called for a long time, but he still could not call for the little assistant. ”

“There was no water on him, nor was there any relief supplies. Yu Zifei clearly knew that he had to maintain his strength and not shout loudly. ”

“Thus, he could only walk while using his gaze to look for the little assistant’s figure. ”

Time passed minute by minute.
