Chapter 175: 086: Murder in prison! A big shot in the business world! 3

The police arrived very quickly.

An Dongliang was taken away by the police.

Ten days later, Xia Xiaoman and an Dongliang’s divorce case officially began.

Because an Dongliang was abusive and cheating, the court directly sentenced him to leave the house with nothing.

This time, an Dongliang really panicked! He knelt in front of Xia Xiaoman and cried bitterly, saying that he would immediately sever all ties with Liang Xinyi.

He would treat Xia Xiaoman and an Lizi well in the future.

Unfortunately, Xia Xiaoman was no longer the Xia Xiaoman of the past. “An Dongliang, we can’t go back! I wish you and Liang Xinyi a long and lasting life!”

The poor and lowly husband and wife were always sad.

Now that an Dongliang had nothing left, could he really stay with Liang Xinyi for a long time?

Hearing this, an Dongliang’s eyes lit up and he immediately found a place to rest.

That’s right!

He still had Liang Xinyi!

With Liang Xinyi by his side, even if he had nothing, he could still make a comeback!

......

An Dongliang got up from the ground. “Xia Xiaoman! Remember what you said today. Don’t regret it in the future!”

Xia Xiaoman smiled. “Don’t worry, I will never regret it.”

After saying this, Xia Xiaoman turned around and left.

An Dongliang also returned to Liang Xinyi’s residence.

In order to celebrate an Dongliang’s successful divorce, Liang Xinyi prepared a sumptuous candlelit dinner.

Looking at the candlelit dinner that Liang Xinyi had prepared meticulously, an Dongliang was very happy.

He knew that Liang Xinyi truly loved him. No matter what he became, Liang Xinyi would never abandon him.

However, after learning that an Dongliang had been stripped clean of his assets, Liang Xinyi’s gentle expression instantly changed. “Dong, Dongliang, stop joking!”The An family had such a large amount of assets, and an Dongliang was the head of the family, how could he be stripped of his assets!

An Dongliang sighed. “It’s true! Xia Xiaoman, that B * Tch, tricked me! I don’t even have a chance to appeal! Xinyi, I don’t have anything now, I only have you.”

“Where’s the court’s verdict? Let me take a look!”Liang Xinyi said.

An Dongliang passed the verdict to Liang Xinyi.

Liang Xinyi initially thought that an Dongliang was testing her.

After reading the verdict, Liang Xinyi’s heart turned cold!

She did not expect that an Dongliang was actually left with nothing!

He did not even get a single cent!

“So, you’re a penniless pauper now?”Liang Xinyi looked at an dongliang.

Back then, she only hooked up with an Dongliang because he was rich.

Now, an Dongliang was already a pauper. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Then, there was no need for her to continue pretending.

She did not want to waste time on a pauper!

“Xinyi?”An Dongliang looked at Liang Xinyi in disbelief. He thought that he was hallucinating.

“An Dongliang, since things have come to this point, let me be frank with you! I never loved you. I was with you because of your money!”

An Dongliang looked at Liang Xinyi in disbelief.

In her eyes, Liang Xinyi had always been a kind and good woman.

How did she become like this?

“Xinyi, you’re joking with me, right?”

Liang xinyi said, “I’m not joking with you! Why Don’t you take a look at yourself! Do you think you’re worthy of me? If you have any self-awareness, pack your things and get lost!”

Hearing these cold and ruthless words, an Dongliang’s face was filled with anger. He raised his hand and slapped Liang Xinyi. “B * Tch! You B * Tch! I’m separated from my family because of you! I’m penniless! How dare you lie to me!”

For so many years, an Dongliang had never thought that Liang Xinyi was with him for money.

Liang Xinyi was stunned. She did not expect an Dongliang to hit her. She screamed, “Ah, you dare to hit me! You’re a poor man! A toad wants to eat swan meat! Shameless!”

These words made an dongliang lose control. He pressed Liang Xinyi to the ground and used whatever he could to hit Liang Xinyi.

“B * Tch! B * Tch, you’ve made me suffer so much! I’ll kill you today!”

Liang Xinyi struggled as she said, “Help! I’ve killed someone!”

“Scream! I’ll Let You Scream!”An Dongliang’s expression became fiercer and fiercer.

Very soon, Liang Xinyi stopped moving.

An Dongliang sat on the ground with a numb expression.

It took a while for an dongliang to react. He looked at Liang Xinyi, who was completely disfigured on the ground, and said with a smile, “Well done! B * Tch! You deserve to die!”

Just as an Dongliang packed his clothes and prepared to escape overnight, the door was kicked open by the police.
