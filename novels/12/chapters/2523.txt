“Hearing this, Old Master Bai’s expression turned serious. He looked at Bai Jingshu. “What’s the matter?” ” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Bai Jingshu helped Old Master Bai Sit Down. “Please sit down first.”

“Old Master Bai didn’t have the mood to sit down now. He continued, “Jingshu, hurry up and tell me!” ”

“”Grandpa, I’m Pregnant,”Bai Jingshu continued. ”

Pregnant?

Elder BAI’s expression turned incredulous. “Really?”

Lin Ze nodded. “It’s really grandpa.”

“”Good, that’s great!”Elder Bai grabbed Bai Jingshu’s hand. “God Bless Us!” ”

“There had been no news of Bai Jingshu and Lin Ze for more than a year. In fact, the person who was most anxious was still elder Bai. ”

He had been praying that Lin Ze and Bai Jingshu would have a child of their own soon.

Fortunately.

“Fortunately, the old man heard his prayers. ”

“Old Man Bai continued, “How long have you been pregnant?” ”

“Bai Jingshu said, “Five weeks.” ”

Old Man Bai did some mental calculations. “That’s more than a month?”

“Yes.”Bai Jingshu nodded.

“Old Man Bai smiled and said, “Does your in-laws know about this?” ”

“They all know.”

“That’s good.”

“Elder Bai looked at Lin Ze, he then said, “Ah Ze, you’re a good child. I can trust you to take care of Jingshu. “I heard that pregnant women have tempers that fluctuate. If she does anything wrong during pregnancy, you have to be tolerant of her.” ”

“Lin Ze said, “Don’t worry, grandfather.” ”

Elder Bai nodded.

He felt that he had not misjudged the person.

“At first, everyone thought that Lin Ze was just an ordinary earthling. Who knew that in the end, this person would suddenly become the hot heir to the Shangguan family. ”

“After their wedding, there were rumors that Lin Ze would definitely dump Bai Jingshu. ”

“After all, Lin Ze was the heir to the Shangguan family. ”

How could a powerful man like him fall for a vase like Bai Jingshu? !

Bai Jingshu had been married to Lin Ze for a year and was not pregnant. This speculation was even more serious.

Some people said that Bai Jingshu would not give birth.

There were also rumors that Lin Ze would not allow Bai Jingshu to give birth.

The future heir to the Shangguan family must have a noble birth mother.

Bai Jingshu was nothing?

But now.

Bai Jingshu was pregnant.

All the rumors were destroyed.

“Old Master Bai’s previous wish was that Bai Jingshu could get pregnant as soon as possible. Now, his only wish was to see his great-grandson be born. ”

“As long as he saw his great-grandson be born, he would be able to close his eyes in peace. ”

He would also be able to walk in peace on the road to the underworld.

“After eating, old master Bai walked to Bai Jingshu’s side and said in a low voice, “Jingshu, come with me for a moment.” ”

“Okay.”Bai Jingshu nodded and followed Old Master Bai’s footsteps.

The grandfather and grandson walked into the study.

“”Close the door,”Old Master Bai said. ”

“Okay.”Bai Jingshu turned around and closed the study’s door.

“Old Master Bai sat at the head of the study and pointed at the stool beside him. “Jingshu, you sit too.” ”

“Bai Jingshu sat on the stool. “Grandfather, do you have something to tell me?” ”

“Yes.”Old Master Bai nodded.

“After that, the old man continued to ask, “How did your in-laws react when you came back this time?” ”

“Bai Jingshu said, “They supported my return and even prepared a lot of gifts for you.” ”

“Hearing that, Old Master Bai stroked his beard and nodded. “Ah Ze’s parents are all kind and courteous people. Since they treat others with courtesy, Jingshu, we have to treat them with courtesy too.” ”

Bai Jingshu was stunned for a moment. She didn’t quite understand what elder Bai meant.

“Elder bai continued, “Jingshu, your sudden return this time was a mistake.” ”

“Why?”Bai Jingshu asked.

“Elder bai continued, “You’re only pregnant now. According to the saying that the fetus is unstable during the first three months of pregnancy, under normal circumstances, most people would only announce it to the public after three months of pregnancy. Try not to travel too far three months ago and be careful. You’re only one month pregnant now and you’ve already come to the s galaxy. If anything happens, how do you want me to explain this to Ah Ze’s parents?” ”

Bai Jingshu did not say anything. She did not expect that there would be so many explanations for her pregnancy.

“”Actually, it’s not your fault. This should have been what your mother told you, but that mother of yours...”at this point, elder Bai sighed softly. “It’s fine if you don’t say it!” ”

“Bai Jingshu looked up at elder Bai. “Grandfather, what should I do now?” ”

“Elder bai said, “I’ll call Ah Ze’s parents and tell them.” ”
