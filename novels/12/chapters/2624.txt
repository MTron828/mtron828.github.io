“”Okay, uncle Wang.”Li Hang continued to nod.”

“After eating, Li Hang drove home.”

“Along the way, she thought a lot.”

“In the end, she had an answer in her heart.”

“In order to avoid arousing Li Dalong’s suspicion by going back too early, Li hang specially sat in a nearby coffee shop for a while and waited until it was dark before going back.”

The next day was the day that Li da long brought his current girlfriend back.

Li hang woke up early.

Li Da Long had just woken up as well.

“”Dad, quickly go and pick up Auntie fan. Leave the house to me.””

“Li Da long smiled and said, “Hang Hang, thank you.”With a daughter as sensible as Li Hang, Li Da Long was really very gratified.”

How many daughters could do what Li Hang did?

“Li hang said somewhat helplessly, “Dad, are you still so estranged from me? Alright, quickly go and pick up aunt fan. Girls need to put on makeup when they go out. You can wait for Aunt Fan.””

“”Okay, okay, I’ll go right away.”Li Da long nodded.” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Li hang seemed to have thought of something and continued, “Oh right, what kind of dishes does aunt fan like to eat? Let aunt fan taste my cooking today.””

“Since he was brought up by his grandmother, Li Hang’s cooking skills were very good.”

Li Da Long was even more touched. It was really rare for his daughter to do what Li Hang did!

“”As long as it’s cooked by you, your auntie fan likes to eat it,”Li da long said.”

“Li hang smiled and said, “Okay, then I’ll make some random dishes.””

“Okay.”Li Da long nodded.

“After Li da long left, Li Hang quickly began to prepare lunch.”

“About two hours later, the doorbell rang in the air.”

Li hang wiped his hands on the apron and immediately ran over to open the door.

“Dad.”

The person standing outside the door was Li da long. Beside Li da long stood a plain-looking middle-aged woman.

She had short black hair and wore a plaid dress. She had no makeup and her facial features were not bad. She had the standard appearance of an ordinary person and was completely different from Zhou Cui Hua.

“Li dalong smiled and introduced, “Hang Hang, this is your aunt fan. Juan ‘er, this is my daughter, Li Hang. You can just call her hang hang.””

“”Hello, Aunt Fan. Come in and have a seat.””

“Fan Juan walked in and said, “Hang Hang is really beautiful! No wonder your father talks about you all day long.””

“”Thank you, Aunt Fan. You’re also very beautiful,”Li Hang said.”

“After saying that, Li hang continued, “We have tea and drinks at home. What would you like to drink, Aunt Fan?””

“Fan Juan said, “Tea and I will do.””

“”Okay, I’ll pour you some tea.””

“Fan Juan stood up and said, “Where’s the Tea? I can pour it myself.””

“”I’ll do it.”Li hang smiled and said, “There’s no reason to let the guests do it.””

“As Li Hang said this, he poured some tea for Fan Juan.”

Fan Juan sized up the young girl in front of her.

Sensible and beautiful. This was her first impression of Li Hang.

“It seemed that Li Da Long was right. He indeed had a rare and good daughter. Initially, fan Juan thought that Li Da Long’s words were more or less exaggerated, but now that she saw Li Hang, she realized.., li Da Long was not exaggerating at all.”

Li Hang was indeed very outstanding.

“Very soon, Li Hang came over with tea. “Auntie fan, please have some tea first. The food will be ready soon.””

“After saying that, Li Hang looked at Li da long and continued, “Dad, please take care of Auntie fan. I’ll go to the kitchen to take a look.””

“Li Da long smiled and said, “You go ahead.””

“Fan Juan stood up as well. “Hang Hang, let me help you.””

“”No need, no need.”Li hang turned around and placed his hand on fan Juan’s shoulder as he sat back down on the sofa. “Auntie fan, you can just sit here and chat with my dad. I’m a junior, so it’s normal for me to cook for you guys.””

Li Hang’s action was also to make his conscience feel better.

She had to let Li da long have some company before she left Li da long.

“Li Da long smiled and looked at fan Juan. “Since it’s hang hang’s filial piety, don’t argue with her.””

“Fan Juan nodded. Looking at Li Hang’s busy figure in the kitchen, she said, “Hang Hang is really a good child.””

This was a heartfelt compliment. It was rare for a child as old as Li Hang to accept his parents’second marriage.

“But not only did Li hang accept it, his attitude was also so sincere. It was really quite surprising.”

“Li Da long said somewhat proudly, “I’ve already said it. Hang Hang is a sensible and obedient child.””

Fan Juan nodded. “Your ex-wife taught her very well.”

“This sentence made Li da long somewhat unhappy. He continued, “What can she teach hang hang? It’s mainly because hang hang is excellent to begin with.””
