Chapter 95: 075: Heal and save. Brother and sister meet

Sun Fulian continued, “My surname is Sun. This is our old man. We met you on the plane before. A year ago, our old man was diagnosed with an incurable disease. The young Divine Doctor is very skilled. Could the young Divine Doctor take a look at my old man?”

At this moment, Lin Sha ran over from not far away. “What happened to searing?”

Ye Zao briefly explained the situation and then said, “Please extend your hand and let me check his pulse.”

Lin Sha knew that ye Zao was skilled in medicine, so she did not ask further. She stood aside and waited quietly for ye Zao.

Old Man Yang extended his hand.

Ye Zao gently put his hand on grandfather Yang’s wrist and focused on listening to his pulse.

A moment later, ye Zao let go of grandfather Yang’s pulse.

Sun Fulian quickly asked, “How is it, Little Miracle Doctor?”

Ye Zao said, “Grandfather Yang’s illness can not be cured simply by taking medicine. It needs to be accompanied by acupuncture. If the two of you trust me, you can leave an address. Tomorrow, I will come to visit grandfather Yang for acupuncture.”

Although the trip to the capital was quite rushed, if she could free up time to treat grandfather Yang’s illness, she would not have much time to play.

However, she was still a doctor.

As a doctor, she could not stand by and watch him die no matter what.

Hearing this, Sun Fu Nian and grandfather Yang looked at each other. Both of them saw hope in each other’s eyes.

Sun Fu Nian’s eyes were red, as if a fishbone was stuck in her throat.

He clearly had a lot of things he wanted to say, but he couldn’t say a single word.

“So you’re saying that my illness can be cured?”Elder Yang tried his best to calm himself down.

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “You can say that.”

Although elder Yang’s illness was incurable, in Ye Zhuo’s hands, it was really not a serious illness.

In her opinion, illnesses that could be cured with medicine were not considered serious illnesses.

Elder Yang tried his best to calm himself down. “Little miracle doctor, how confident are you?”

Even though ye Zhuo was just a child in his teens.

But he gave off a sense of stability that even an adult did not have.

It inexplicably made people feel at ease.

It was said that the mountain was not high, but if there was a fairy, it would be a spirit.

Medical Skills and knowledge were the same.

Age did not determine one’s ability.

Some people lived their entire lives and might not even be as good as a child.

Elder Yang did not know what was wrong with him either. He had only met ye Zao once, yet he trusted ye Zao so much.

Ye Zao’s tone was indifferent. “Yes, 70% .”

Although his tone was very shallow and also very faint, it was very powerful.

Elder Yang had been sick for so long, and this was the first time he saw hope.

Winter was over, and all things were revived. Spring was warm and flowers were blooming.

Elder Yang continued, “Little Miracle Doctor, where do you live? When are you free tomorrow? I’ll get the driver to pick you up.”

Ye Zhuo gave his address and phone number.

Sun Fulian quickly took out his phone and wrote it down.

“Little Miracle Doctor, then we’ll send the driver to pick you up at 9:30 a.m. Tomorrow. Do you think it’s okay?”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “Yes.”

After saying that, ye Zhuo continued, “Oh right, I rushed to Beijing this time and didn’t make any preparations. You still need to prepare a set of acupuncture equipment.”

Ye Zhuo had come to Beijing this time to attend Miao Yin’s annual gala. He didn’t expect to meet elder Yang, so he naturally didn’t prepare any medical equipment.

Sun Fulian asked, “Young Godly doctor, do you have any requirements for acupuncture equipment?”

“Just a normal silver needle will do,”ye Zhuo replied.

Sun Fulian nodded. “Alright.”

Grandfather Yang originally wanted to Treat Ye Zhuo and Lin Shasha to a meal, but ye Zhuo declined.

When grandfather Yang returned to the manor, Mu Yourong had yet to leave.

“There’s a guest at home?”Knowing that there was hope for his illness to be cured, grandfather Yang was in a good mood and smiled at the servants beside him.

When he saw grandfather Yang, Yang Danian quickly went up to him. “Dad! You’re finally back.” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Grandfather Yang patted the snow on his body and said doubtfully, “You’re waiting for me.”

“I’m not waiting for you. There’s a noble waiting for you.”Yang Danian brought grandfather Yang into the living room. “Dad, this is the successor of the Godly Doctor Hua Tuo, Miss Mu!”

The Godly Doctor Hua Tuo?

Grandfather Yang frowned slightly.

During the period when he was sick, many famous doctors came to recommend themselves.

However, none of them were really capable!

Grandfather Yang did not believe any of these people who claimed to be famous doctors and recommended themselves.

Yang Danian continued, “Dad, Miss MU brought the ancestral godly medicine over. This medicine will definitely help you recover.”
