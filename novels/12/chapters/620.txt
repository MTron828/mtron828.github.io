“”Great burning, I’ve already found out.” ”

Ye Zhuo took the information.

He frowned slightly.

“According to the information Xiao Bai found out, although Feng Qianhua was the eldest daughter of the Feng family, she was not the daughter of the Feng family’s old madam. ”

“When the Feng family’s old master was young, he was a womanizer. The red flags at home did not fall, and the colorful flags outside fluttered. ”

Feng Qianhua was a womanizer that the Feng family’s old patriarch had caused outside.

“When the Feng family’s old patriarch carried Feng Qianhua back, the Feng family’s old madam also cried and made a scene. But in the end, she still lost to reality. ”

Because there were only two ways to face her.

Either accept this child. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Or divorce.

“For the sake of the family’s face, and for the sake of her four young sons not being mistreated by their stepmother, the Feng family’s old Madam accepted this fact with tears in her eyes and announced to the public that Feng Qianhua was her biological child. ”

“For so many years, apart from old madam Feng and the relatives of the Feng family, no one else knew about this secret. ”

Feng Qianhua and Mrs Zhang were so close. Could it be that the two of them were mother and daughter?

“But according to the information, Feng Qianhua’s biological mother, Xu Lanying, was already dead. ”

Could it be.

“In fact, Xu Lanying was not dead at all. ”

Was she the current Mrs Zhang?

And the health-preserving soup that Feng Qianhua sent to Old Lady Lin every day.

“In their conversation, they mentioned the health-preserving soup more than once. ”

Was the health-preserving soup really that magical.

Or was there another mystery behind it?

Did Old Lady Lin Raise a tiger as a threat and reap the consequences.

Ye Zhuo narrowed his eyes.

This matter seemed to be getting more and more interesting.

She was also looking forward to the day when the truth would be revealed.

On the other side.

At the CEN residence.

Old Mrs. Cen sat on the sofa and waited for Cen Shaoqing to return.

“It was almost twelve o’clock, but there was no sign of CEN Shaoqing. Old Mrs. Cen was extremely anxious. ”

“When she heard the sound of footsteps, she jumped up from the sofa and ran out the door. She was so excited that even her slippers flew away. “Fifth, Shaoqing is back!” ”

“Grandma.”

“Old Mrs. Cen said impatiently, “How was your trip to the burning house today? Did you manage to settle your father-in-law and mother-in-law? Did everything go smoothly?” ”

“CEN Shaoqing said, “The situation is a little better than expected. It’s just that Ah Ze’s side might still have some misunderstandings about me.” ”

“Ah Ze?”Old Mrs. Cen stood on the small stool and slapped Cen Shaoqing. “That’s your brother! Your biological brother! I’ve already said it. There’s a cause and there’s a consequence. It’s your fault for being blind and offending Ah Ze!”

Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads and silently accepted the criticism.

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Other than Ah Ze, what is the attitude of your father-in-law and mother-in-law?” ”

Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips parted slightly. “Uncle and aunt don’t object to us being together.”

“”That’s good.”Old Mrs. Lin heaved a sigh of relief, then, she said, “You Brat, you have to live up to your expectations too. When you have time, you should look at the law of wooing a wife and learn how the great CEO goes about wooing his wife! You must not bully Yezi! If you dare to bully Yezi and do anything to let her down, your grandmother will beat your dog’s Head Up!” ”

“Cen Shaoqing nodded. “Don’t worry, I won’t.” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen glanced at Cen Shaoqing and raised her chin proudly, “It’s also your kid’s fortune to have a good grandmother like me in China! If it wasn’t for me, a godly assistant, would you be able to chase after Yezi so quickly? Tell me, did you, Little Brat, Save the Milky Way in your previous life?” ”

“If she was like Old Lady Lin, an old fool and sweet-natured person, then Cen Shaoqing would be finished. ”

“CEN Shaoqing then nodded, “Yes, yes, yes, you are the best grandmother in the world.” ”

“”That’s right!”If Old Lady Cen had a tail, then she would definitely be in the sky by now. ”

The next morning.

Ye Zhuo was running in the garden as usual when he happened to run into the butler walking over.

“”Grandpa Butler,”ye Zhuo greeted politely. ”

“Young miss.”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “How many times have I told you, you can just call me Zhuo Zhuo.” ”

“The Butler said with a serious face, “The master is the master, and the servant is the servant! Young Miss, you can’t break the rules of the entire Lin family just because of me.” ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Grandpa Butler, can I ask you a question?” ”

“”Please Ask, miss. .” ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “How many years has aunt Zhang stayed in our Lin Family?” ”

“The Butler raised his head and calculated, “About... about twenty years.” ”

“After that, the butler continued, “Miss. . Why are you asking this?” ”

“Ye Zhuo said, “It’s nothing. I just asked casually.” ”
