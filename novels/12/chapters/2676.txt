Translator: 549690339

“The driver asked, “Big Sister, is your sister married to the head of the Lin Family?” ”

“”Yes, yes, yes. It’s the head of the Lin family, Lin Qingcheng.” ”

Lin Qingcheng?

The driver frowned. “But isn’t the head of the Lin family called Lin Jincheng? Who Is Lin Qingcheng?”

“”Lin Jincheng?”Ye Sui continued, “You must be mistaken! My Brother-in-law is clearly called Lin Qingcheng.” ”

“Although it had been a long time, because Lin Jincheng was very handsome when he was young, ye Sui still remembered his name. ”

“I’m not mistaken. The head of the Lin family is called Lin Jincheng.”The driver nodded. “It’s Jinxiu’s Jincheng. The head of the Lin family is very famous in the capital. His sons and daughters are also very outstanding. I Won’t be mistaken about his name.”

“Ye Sui smiled and said, “Master, you must be mistaken!” ”

“Back then, ye Sui had witnessed Ye Shu and Lin Qingcheng’s love life. ”

“But back then, Lin Qingcheng was just a poor boy, so ye Sui didn’t care. ”

“If she had known that Lin Qingcheng was an invisible rich man, she would have definitely thought of a way to please Lin Qingcheng. She heard that Lin Qingcheng had four older brothers! Then she and Ye Shu were sisters-in-law now. ”

How could they be like now.

“Ye Shu was already a rich lady from a wealthy family, but what about her? ”

She was still the wife of an ordinary worker.

“She and Ye Shu grew up together. Ye Shu had been outstanding looking since she was young. Later on, she followed a poor boy and gave birth to an illegitimate daughter. This made ye Sui extremely happy! ”

So what if Ye Shu was good-looking?

“She lived in the basement and raised an illegitimate daughter. In the end, she was even cursed as a mistress. ”

She was different.

“Zhou Haitao was a native of Yun Jing. Not only was he handsome, but he also had a house and a car at home. At that time, ye Sui was extremely superior. ”

Who knew that the tables would turn soon!

“”Big Sister, is your sister really married to the head of the Lin Family?”The driver expressed his doubt. ”

“”I’m sure!”Ye Sui said, “Would I be mistaken about my brother-in-law’s name?” ”

“The chauffeur continued, “Big sister, if you don’t believe me, you can search on the internet to see if the head of the Lin family is Lin Qingcheng or Lin Jincheng.” ”

“Ye Sui looked at Zhou Ziyue. “Ziyue, you search.” ”

Zhou Ziyue nodded. She opened her phone and used the search engine to search for the name of the head of the Lin family.

“A moment later, Zhou Ziyue looked up at ye Sui. “Mom.” ”

“What’s Wrong?”Ye Sui asked.

“Zhou ziyue continued, “The head of the Lin family in the encyclopedia is indeed called Lin Jincheng.” ”

“Lin Jincheng?”Ye Sui asked.

“”Yes.”At that moment, Zhou Ziyue also began to doubt. ”

Was Lin Jincheng and Lin Qingcheng the same person? Was Ye Shu really married to a millionaire!

How could someone like ye Shu really marry a millionaire.

“The driver smiled and said, “That’s what I said. The head of the Lin family is Lin Jincheng.” ”

“Mom?”Zhou Ziyue looked at ye Sui.

“Ye Sui frowned slightly and said, “Then, then maybe I made a mistake! It doesn’t matter if the name is wrong, as long as the person is right! Anyway, my brother-in-law is the head of the Lin Family!” ”

The driver didn’t say anything.

“Zhou ziyue tugged at ye Sui’s clothes and said in a low voice, “Mom, are you sure that your uncle-in-law is really the head of the Lin Family?” ”

“Yes!”Ye Sui nodded.

“Since she was already here, she had to go to the Lin family to find out. She absolutely couldn’t let go of this opportunity to turn things around. ”

Zhou Ziyue didn’t say anything else.

The driver in the front seat also didn’t say anything else.

“Not long after, the car stopped at the entrance of a low-key manor. At the entrance were two hundred-year-old towering trees, and the security booth was hidden under thick leaves. ”

Low-key and mysterious.

“”Big sister, we’re here,”the driver reminded. ”

“We’re here already?”Ye Sui looked out of the window. “Are you sure this is the manor where my sister’s brother-in-law lives?”

“The driver smiled and said, “It’s here. The place where rich people live is heavily guarded. If outsiders go in first, they have to make an appointment in advance. You can go to the security booth and ASK.” ”

Only then did ye Sui notice the security booth hidden under the big tree.

“The mother and daughter pulled their suitcases and walked inside. Before they reached the inside, they were stopped by the security staff in uniform. ”

“Who are you looking for?”

“Ye Sui smiled and said, “I’m looking for my sister and brother-in-law. My brother-in-law is Lin Jincheng and my sister is Ye Shu. I’m their sister, Ye Sui. This is their niece, Zhou Ziyue.” ”

“The staff looked ye Sui up and down and said, “Wait a moment.” ”

“Although ye Sui didn’t look like ye Shu’s relative, she was still surnamed ye after all. They still had to investigate clearly to avoid offending the nobleman. ”

On the other side.

In the manor.

Ye Shu was playing mahjong when the housekeeper walked over. “Madam.”

“What’s Wrong?”Ye Shu turned around.

The housekeeper whispered into ye Shu’s ear.

“Hearing this, Ye Shu frowned slightly. ”

Why was ye Sui Here?

“Today was a good day. If she just ignored ye Sui, based on ye Sui’s character, since she was able to find him, she would definitely make a big fuss. ”

“Ye Shu thought about it in her heart and said, “Okay, I got it. Let them in first.” ”

“Alright.”

“After the Butler left, Ye Shu looked at the few people at the table. “Sister-in-law, second sister-in-law, and third sister-in-law. I’m sorry, but I have a small matter to take care of. You guys can play for now.” ”

“Then let Jingshu take over.”.

Ye Shu nodded and called Bai Jingshu to take over.

“After a while, Ye Shu went to the back hall and waited. ”

“On this side, ye Sui was brought in by the butler. ”

They came in by car.

“After entering, ye Sui found out that the interior of the Lin family manor was different. The deeper they went, the more luxurious the decorations. ”

It turned out that ye Shu had been living such a good life all these years!

Ye Sui was extremely envious.

“A few minutes later, the car stopped in front of a building. ”

“Both of you can get off.”

“Ye Sui nodded and held Zhou Ziyue’s hand. “Come, Ziyue, we’re here.” ”

Zhou Ziyue followed ye Sui’s footsteps.

“As they walked into the house, ye Sui asked, “Uncle, who did you say you were? Are You My Sister’s housekeeper?” ”

Ye Sui had only heard of the word “Housekeeper”in television dramas. He did not expect to see it with his own eyes today.

The housekeeper nodded. “Yes.”

“What About My Sister?”Ye Sui asked.
