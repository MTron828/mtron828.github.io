“”Madam is in the front hall now. Please wait a moment,”the Butler said. ”

In the front hall.

“Hearing this, ye Sui looked around and remembered what he had seen when he came in the car. He then asked, “Are all the places here my sister’s Home?” ”

The Butler glanced at ye Sui and nodded. “Yes.”

It was obvious that the mother and daughter were not easy to deal with.

He did not understand why ye Shu had such relatives.

“It was one thing to hear about it, but it was another to witness it with one’s own eyes. Ye Sui’s eyes were full of envy. ”

“”Little Shu is really rich!”Ye Sui looked at the housekeeper and continued, “Do you know who I am? I Am Little Shu’s biological sister!” ”

She wanted to announce to the world that ye Shu was her sister.

The Butler did not say anything and only smiled politely.

“Ye Sui continued, “Why isn’t my sister here yet? Why Don’t you hurry her up?” ”

“The butler said, “Don’t worry, Madam should be here soon.” ”

“How long have you worked at my sister’s House?”Ye Sui continued to ask.

“The housekeeper continued, “It’s been twenty years.” ”

“Ye Sui said in surprise, “Twenty years?” ”

The housekeeper nodded.

Ye Sui was very surprised.

Twenty years!

“To be able to hire a housekeeper twenty years ago, how rich must the Lin family be! ”

As expected of a rich family!

“Ye Sui asked again, “Then how much do you earn for a month now?” ”

“”I get an annual salary,”the housekeeper said. ”

“Annual salary?”Ye Sui asked.

The housekeeper nodded.

“Ye Sui continued, “Then your annual salary must be very high, right?” ” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Although ye Sui had never come into contact with a wealthy family, he knew that the annual salary was usually at least 200,000 yuan. ”

“A housekeeper’s annual salary was already over 200,000 yuan. The Lin family was really too rich! ”

The housekeeper didn’t say anything.

“Zhou Ziyue pulled on ye Sui’s sleeve and said in a low voice, “Mom, don’t talk so much.” ”

Ye Sui looked like a country bumpkin who had never seen the world. It was too embarrassing!

“What About Me?”Ye Sui was a little speechless. “He’s just a servant. Do I have to be afraid of Him?”

“Zhou ziyue said, “Mom, I didn’t mean that. Anyway, you should just say less.” ”

Ye Sui was about to say something else when footsteps suddenly came from outside.

“”Madam,”the butler greeted respectfully. ”

Ye Sui immediately smiled and ran out. “Little Shu!”

“When he saw ye Shu, ye Sui was stunned. ”

“Was the person in front of him wearing a cheongsam, elegant temperament, and expensive jewelry really ye Shu? ”

This was too different from the Ye Shu in ye Sui’s memory!

“Little Shu?”

“”Sis,”ye Shu called out. ”

“She grew up with ye Sui. During her most difficult times, ye Sui lent her 300 yuan. ”

“Although the money wasn’t much, it was a life-saving straw for ye Shu at that time. ”

Ye Sui just liked to climb higher and trample on the lower ones. He wasn’t completely heartless.

“”Aiya, Little Shu! It’s really you!”Ye Sui hugged ye Shu and was extremely happy. “Little Shu, I’ve finally met you!” ”

“As he finished speaking, ye Sui let go of Ye Shu and looked at Zhou Ziyue. “Ziyue, quickly call for Help!” ”

“Zhou Ziyue looked at the elegantly dressed lady in front of her and then looked at ye Sui who was beside the lady. She could not tell what expression she had in her eyes, so she politely called out, “Aunt.” ”

Ye Shu looked at Zhou Ziyue and smiled. “I haven’t seen you in a few years. Ziyue has become more beautiful again.”

“After saying that, ye Shu asked again, “Have you found a family yet?” ”

“Zhou Ziyue was two years older than ye Zhuo. Under normal circumstances, she should have found a family. ”

“Without waiting for Zhou Ziyue to speak, ye Sui interrupted, “Not yet! What kind of good family can you find in a small place like Yun Jing?” ”

“Hearing that, the butler’s expression changed. ”

Yun Jing could not find a good family?

Then what did ye Sui Mean?

Did she mean that she wanted ye Shu to find a good family for ye Zhuo in the capital?

That would only be possible if the capital’s influential people could see Zhou Ziyue last week!

“Ye Shu also heard the hidden meaning in ye Sui’s words. She didn’t answer him, but said, “Where’s brother-in-law? has brother-in-law come?” ”

“”No, he’s at his hometown!”Ye Sui continued, “Little Shu, where’s brother-in-law?” ”

“Ye Shu said, “There’s a guest at home today. He’s in the front hall greeting the guests.” ”

Guests?

“Hearing this, Ye Sui was a little unhappy. ”

Lin Jincheng was greeting guests in the front hall?

Then what kind of person was she in the Lin Family?

What did ye Shu mean by this?

“However, ye Sui didn’t show any displeasure on his face. He smiled and said, “I see! Oh right, Xiao Shu, I also brought gifts for you, brother-in-law, and the children.” ”

“As she spoke, ye Sui opened the suitcase that she had brought with her. ”

“After opening the suitcase, it was filled with some of the specialties from her hometown. ”

“Vegetables, corn, and so on. ”

“Ye Sui smiled and said, “I specially went back to my hometown to pick these. I knew you couldn’t buy them in a big city.” ”

“As the saying goes, a gift from a thousand miles away is light but heavy. ”

“In fact, ye Sui did not go back to her hometown at all. She bought these things in the supermarket. ”

“Anyway, the vegetables she bought looked the same as the vegetables she picked in the field, so ye Shu definitely couldn’t tell. ”

“”Sister, thank you!”Ye Shu smiled and said, “It’s hard for you to bring vegetables from such a far place.” ”

“”We’re sisters, there’s no need to be so polite,”ye Sui said. ”

“Ye Shu continued, “Sister, you and Ziyue have worked hard all the way here. Take a rest first. Butler, ask the kitchen to make some food and bring it to the guest room.” ”

“”Yes, Madam.” ”

“”Sister, Ziyue, follow me to the guest room.” ”

This sentence made boss ye Sui unhappy again.

Guest Room?

She was ye Shu’s sister and could be considered half the owner of this house. How could ye Shu let her stay in the guest room!

This was too much!

“After all, she had made a fortune and started to disown her family! ”

Ye Sui cursed ye Shu in his heart and smiled as he followed ye Shu’s footsteps.

The guest room was on the second floor.

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “Sister, Ziyue lives next door to you. If you have any problems, you can call the housekeeper at any time.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Sui nodded.

“Ye Shu continued, “The housekeeper will send food over in a while. If you want to take a shower, there’s a bathroom in the room. The toiletries in there are all new. You can use them as you like.” ”

“”Okay,”ye Sui said. ”

“Ye Shu continued, “Then I’ll go to the front hall to take a look. You guys can rest after eating.” ”

“After saying that, Ye Shu turned around and left. ”

“Watching ye Shu’s back disappear at the elevator exit, ye Sui said in a low voice, “They actually let us stay in the guest room! They even said that there are guests in the front hall! If the guests in the front hall are guests, then what am I! ! Ye Shu, this little b * tch, once she became rich, she wouldn’t be able to see the sisters that she had gone through thick and thin with! What was that! ”

“”Mom, Please Lower Your Voice.”Zhou Ziyue immediately stopped ye Sui. ”

“Ye Sui said, “Don’t worry, my voice is low. They won’t be able to hear me.” ”

Zhou Ziyue didn’t say anything and sighed.

“Ye Sui continued, “Don’t worry, your mom isn’t that stupid. At times like this, I will build a good relationship with her and try to get her to introduce you to a good partner. When that happens, our family will be able to hold our heads high in front of your uncle’s family.” ”

“But...”Zhou Ziyue was a little hesitant.

“”But what? !”Ye Sui frowned and said sternly, “Ziyue, let me tell you, don’t think about those nonsense! How can a person like Feng Yang be worthy of you! He is simply a toad that wants to eat swan meat!” ”

“Feng Yang was Zhou Ziyue’s boyfriend. The two of them began to fall in love in university and it was not easy for them to get to where they were now. Unfortunately, ye Sui had always looked down on Feng Yang because the Feng family was not rich enough to give Zhou Ziyue a rich and noble life. ”

“Ye Sui continued, “I’m warning you, break up with Feng Yang immediately! Then ask your aunt to introduce you to someone better!” ”

“”Men are afraid of entering the wrong line of work and women are afraid of marrying the wrong man. If you get together with that kind of person, you will regret it for the rest of Your Life!” ”

“In the past, ye Sui never thought that men were afraid of entering the wrong line of work and women were afraid of marrying the wrong man until he saw ye Shu’s success. ”

Ye Shu was able to get to where she was today because she married well.

“She had already missed a chance and couldn’t marry again. However, Zhou Ziyue was still young, so she still had a chance. ”

“Zhou Ziyue hesitated for a moment and then said, “Mom, but this is too unfair to Feng Yang.” ”

“After all, Feng Yang was Zhou Ziyue’s first love, so Zhou Ziyue had forgotten him just like that. For a moment, Zhou Ziyue really couldn’t accept it. ”

“”Fair, can fair be a meal?”Ye Sui looked at Zhou Ziyue and asked, “Let me ask you, do you want to live like me or like your aunt?” ”

Zhou Ziyue was silent.

“Ye Sui continued, “If you want to live like me, then just pretend that I never said these words. You can live like Feng Yang!” ”

“Mother!”Zhou Ziyue looked at ye Sui.

“Ye Sui continued, “Ziyue, you have to believe one thing. No mother in the world would harm her own daughter! If you have to choose Feng Yang, mother will not object. Just don’t regret it in the future.” ”

Zhou Ziyue fell silent again.

“She was very envious of Ye Shu’s current life, but she did not want to break up with Feng Yang. ”

It was true that she liked Feng Yang.

It was also true that she wanted to grow old together with Feng Yang.

Why couldn’t love have it both ways?

“Ye Sui wanted to slap Zhou Ziyue directly to wake her up, but after thinking about it, she held back. ”

“As a mother, she believed that Zhou Ziyue would definitely wake up. ”

“”Ziyue, think about it yourself,”ye Sui continued, “You only have one life. If you make the wrong choice, you can’t start over. So, think about it yourself.” ”
