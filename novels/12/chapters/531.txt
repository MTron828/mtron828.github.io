“Zha Zha Zha!”

“At this moment, a male voice suddenly appeared in the air. ”

Ye Zha turned his head slightly and saw that Lin Ze had appeared at the entrance of the garden at some point in time. He was looking in his direction with a wary gaze.

“Brother?”Ye Zha was a little surprised.

“Lin Ze walked directly between Ye Zha and Cen Shaoqing and separated the two of them. He looked at ye Zha and said, “Zha Zha, mom is looking for you. Let’s go back.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zao nodded slightly and followed Lin Ze’s footsteps.

They walked to a corner.

“Lin Ze said, “Zao Zao, do you know Cen Fifth Master?” ”

Ye Zao nodded slightly. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Lin Ze turned around and looked, then, he said, “CEN fifth master is famous at a young age. His personality is eccentric. He usually eats vegetables and reads Buddhism. He seems to be able to see through the secular world and stay aloof from worldly affairs. In fact, he is just a ferocious beast that lurks in the dark. He can give people a fatal blow at any time. “Zha Zha, you’re still young. You’re not a match for such an Old Fox. Try not to talk to him in the future.” ”

Ye Zha was only 19 years old this year.

How could she be a match for the wily old Cen Shaoqing?

“Is he that terrifying?”Ye Zha raised his eyebrows slightly.

“Lin Ze said very seriously, “CEN fifth master is far more terrifying than what I said.” ”

“Ye Zha said, “Brother, do you have some misunderstanding about him?” ”

“”Zao Zao, you can’t judge a person by his appearance,”Lin ze said slowly, then, he said, “Fifth Master Cen is only thirty-one years old this year, but he has already monopolized the business world in China and made the CEN family the number one family in China. How can such a person be a simple person?” ”

“After saying that, Lin ze continued, “Moreover, as far as I know, fifth master Cen has always been pure-hearted and doesn’t get close to women. For No Reason, why is he so close to you? He must have other motives!” ”

“Ye Zhuo looked up at Lin Ze. “Brother, actually, I’ve known Cen Shaoqing for quite some time. I feel that he’s pretty good. He meets my criteria for choosing friends in all aspects.” ”

“Hearing this, Lin Ze’s heart skipped a beat. ”

“It’s over, it’s over! ”

His inexperienced sister was about to be deceived by this sly fox.

“Alarm Bells Rang in Lin Ze’s heart, “Zha Zha, I’ve known Cen Shaoqing for nineteen years. I know him better than you do. Not only is he grumpy, he’s also likely to be violent. He’s so close to you, he must be up to no good.” ”

Ye Zhuo raised an eyebrow. “Violent?”Why couldn’t she tell that Cen Shaoqing had a violent side to him?

“Lin Ze nodded seriously. “Yes, and it’s a very serious violent side.” ”

“Ye Zhuo touched his nose out of habit. “Brother, have you experienced his violent side?” ”

“”Sort of,”Lin ze replied. ”

“Although Lin Ze was only three years old at the time, that experience was still fresh in his mind. He still couldn’t forget the scene of Cen Shaoqing holding him in the swimming pool to wash up. ”

“From then on, he didn’t dare to visit the Cen family as a guest. ”

“Lin Ze continued, “In any case, zhuozhuo, you just need to keep your distance from him.” ”

Ye Zhuo turned around to look at Cen Shaoqing.

Cen Shaoqing was stunned by Ye Zhuo’s gaze. A bad premonition suddenly ignited in his heart.

His future brother-in-law definitely didn’t speak well of him in front of ye Zhuo!

“He couldn’t really still remember that incident 16 years ago, right? ”

“Cen Shaoqing’s hand that was holding the Buddha beads paused as he looked at the back of the brother and sister. His deep eyes could not see the end, as far as the eye could see, as if there was a vast universe hidden in his eyes. ”

“In the hall, the banquet was still going on. ”

“Feng Xianxian looked at ye Zao who walked in with Lin Ze, and her eyes narrowed slightly. ”

Her hands unconsciously tightened.

“Seeing this scene, it would be a lie to say that she did not feel anything at all. ”

What right did ye Zhuo have?

“She had called Lin ze her elder brother for nineteen years, but Lin Ze did not respond at all. He treated her like a stranger and did not treat her as a sister at all. ”

How many days had ye Zhuo been here?

“Could it be that before she became Lin Ze’s nineteen-year-old brother and sister, she was worse than a stranger that she had only known for a few days? ”

Heartless ingrate!

Lin Ze was a heartless ingrate!

“”Xianxian, what’s Wrong?”Old Lady Lin asked concernedly when she saw that Feng Xianxian was acting strangely. ”

“Feng Xianxian pretended to smile innocently. “Nothing. I’m just happy that brother Ah Ze has finally found his sister! Grandma, look how much brother Ah Ze dotes on sister ye Zao.” ”

Old Lady Lin looked up at Lin Ze and ye Zao with a cold expression.

She felt that Lin Ze was very insensible.

“After all, Feng Xianxian had been his brother and sister for so many years. The two of them had grown up together. He was usually cold to Feng Xianxian and did not even have a smile on his face, but he was so nice to that wild girl.., not to mention Feng Xianxian, no matter who it was, they would probably feel very uncomfortable, right? ”
