Translator: 549690339

Feng Qianhua was unwilling.

She was unwilling to have her position snatched away by Ye Shu just like that.

“She was originally the eldest daughter of a rich family. After marrying that disappointing man, within a year, she had become an ordinary housewife. ”

But Ye Shu had transformed from the lowest class to the mistress of the Lin family.

How could she accept this?

Fortunately.

“Fortunately, she had waited until today. ”

“Now, she could finally sit in the position of the mistress of the Lin family. ”

As for that B * Tch ye Shu!

“Until her death, she would never be able to see Lin Jin city again. ”

“Thinking of this, Feng Qianhua curled the corners of her lips. Her eyes were filled with pride. She said gently, “Ah Ze, your father is not available to answer the phone right now.” ”

“What’s My father doing? Where are you guys now?”

“Feng qianhua deliberately said ambiguously, “AH ze, sometimes it’s not convenient for us adults to tell you things about a child. Don’t call him again. Your father will be back on the 18th.” ”

The 18th?

Wasn’t the 18th the day of their engagement?

“When Lin Ze wanted to say something else, Feng Qianhua had already hung up the phone. ”

“On the other end of the phone, Lin Ze was frowning. ”

“Since he couldn’t find Lin Jincheng, he could only check on his mother first. ”

“Now that he had photos, he was much more confident. ”

“After all, there were photos in the population database. ”

“Lin Ze carried his bag back to the Lin residence, locked the door, and began to search for information. ”

“There were many firewalls and security systems in the database, so it was not easy to break in. ”

Lin Ze’s fingers kept jumping on the keyboard.

The only thing that could be heard in the quiet air was the crackling sound.

“The fluorescent light from the computer screen hit his face. He was only nineteen years old, but he gave off the impression of an adult! ”

It was fascinating.

The sky was getting darker and darker.

Lin Ze kept doing one thing.

…

On the other side.

After the collaboration ended.

“Feng Qianhua walked to Lin Jincheng’s side. “Brother Jincheng, are you tired? Let me help you over there to rest for a while.” ”

Lin Jincheng gently pulled his arm away from Feng Qianhua’s. “I’ll be fine here by myself. You should go back and rest first.”

The smile on Feng Qianhua’s face was a little stiff.

“Lin Jincheng’s behavior told her that although he had already agreed to the engagement, he was still resisting her. ”

“Although they stayed in the same hotel, they had two suites. ”

“But at this moment, Feng Qianhua had no choice but to maintain a decent smile, “Then I’ll go back first. Oh right, ah ze called in the afternoon. If the child really doesn’t agree to us being together, then forget it. I’ll respect the child’s opinion. I don’t want anyone to be hurt.” ”

“After saying this, Feng Qianhua turned around and left. ”

Lin Jincheng looked at Feng Qianhua’s back and unconsciously frowned.

He tried very hard to convince himself to accept Feng Qianhua. Feng Qianhua was the person in his memories.

But he found that he couldn’t accept it at all.

“Being with Feng Qianhua, he couldn’t feel the happiness described in the diary at all. ”

Maybe he still needed time.

Lin Jincheng sighed softly. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Ye family.

“After eating, Ye Zhuo looked at Ye Shu. After hesitating for a moment, he said, “Mom, can you tell me about my father?” ”

“After being reborn for such a long time, Ye Zhuo had never heard ye Shu talk about her biological father. ”

Today’s encounter made her curious about the word ‘father’.

Ye Shu was stunned for a moment before she recovered.

Ye Zhuo was nineteen this year. There were some things that could not be hidden from her for the rest of her life.

She had the right to know her biological father.

“Ye Shu fell into the memories of that year when she was eighteen. “Your father was from Liu City. His name was Lin Qingcheng. I met him when I was eighteen. At that time, he was nineteen…” ”

Ye Shu told ye Zhuo everything about how she met Lin Jincheng without reservation.

“”When the woman who claimed to be your father’s fiancé came to me, I didn’t believe that I was a mistress, nor did I believe that he would lie to me. Because in my eyes, he was a man who stood tall and strong. He was a gentleman! He wouldn’t lie to me.” ”

“”I’ve been waiting for him, but he didn’t show up until after you were born.” ”

“”He didn’t show up, so I had to go find him myself. In Liu City, Lin Qingcheng found a few, but none of them matched him.” ”

“At this point, a sarcastic smile appeared on Ye Shu’s lips. “At that time, I found out that he left a fake name and his home address was also fake.” ”

“Now, Ye Shu spoke so casually, and at that time, she was so desperate. ”
