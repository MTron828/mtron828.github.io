Translator: 549690339

The nurse entered Ye Sen’s name into the computer. “There’s a patient named ye Sen. He was transferred in at 8:50 last night. He’s now in the ICU Ward on the third floor.”

“Hearing that, father Zhao hurriedly said, “How is he? How is my son? Is he out of danger now?” ”

“Not yet.”The nurse shook her head. “The situation is very serious. Your family members should be mentally prepared as soon as possible.”

The situation is very serious?

Father Zhao staggered and almost lost his balance.

“At this moment, the Butler finally caught up with Father Zhao. “Master! How is the young master?” ”

Young Master?

Master?

Were these two acting in a rich family drama?

“The nurse on duty had only been an intern for half a month. When she heard such a strange name, the nurse looked at Father Zhao curiously. ”

This was not something to look at.

She saw that Father Zhao was covered in some famous luxury brand’s high-quality products.

Tsk.

No wonder it was the master!

“The nurse continued, “The elevator over there can go directly to the third floor ICU. Oh right, Ye Sen lives at A306.” ”

“Hearing this, Father Zhao hurriedly ran in the direction of the elevator. ”

The Butler followed Father Zhao’s footsteps.

“A few seconds later, the elevator reached the third floor. ”

“As soon as he exited the elevator, Father Zhao ran out. ”

“The Butler followed behind and said, “Master! You’re going the wrong way! A306 is over here!” ”

“Hearing this, Father Zhao immediately turned around and walked over. ”

“Therefore, Lin Jincheng and ye Shu stood in front of the transparent glass window and looked at Ye Sen. ”

“”A Ye! A Ye! A Ye, my son! It’s all father’s fault! Father has let you down! My Son...” ”

Father Zhao lay in front of the glass window and cried loudly.

Lin Jincheng and Ye Shu were stunned.

Who was this person?

“Lin Jincheng turned to look at Ye Shu and said in a low voice, “A Shu, is he your father?” ”

Ye Shu shook her head. “No.”

“Since he wasn’t, then he must have mistaken him for someone else. ”

“Lin Jincheng looked at Father Zhao. “Uncle, you’ve mistaken him for someone else! He’s not your son!” ”

Only then did father Zhao realize Lin Jincheng and ye Shu. “I didn’t make a mistake! I didn’t make a mistake! He is my son!”

“Ye Shu stood up and said, “Uncle, you really made a mistake! The person lying inside is my brother. How can he be your son?” ”

“Father Zhao wiped his tears. “You Are Ye Shu, right?” ”

“I am.”Ye Shu nodded.

“Father Zhao continued, “Ye Sen is indeed my son. He is the son of me and Ye Yuyi.” ”

Ye Yuyi?

These words made ye Shu feel even stranger.

“But ye Yuyi is our aunt!”

“”No!”Father Zhao continued wiping his tears. “Ye Yuyi is ye Sen’s biological mother. Zhang Cuiping is only ye Sen’s foster mother! If you don’t believe me, you can do a paternity test!” ”

Ye Shu’s eyes were filled with disbelief.

She had never thought that she and Ye Sen were not Zhang Cuiping’s children.

But this also explained why Zhang Cuiping was the only one who treated her and ye Sen badly.

“At this moment, ye Langhua ran over from the elevator. “How is it? How is Little Sen?” ”

Ye Shu shook her head with reddened eyes. “Nothing much!”

“Hearing that, ye Langhua frowned. At this moment, she suddenly saw Father Zhao. “Why are you here?” ”

“Ye Shu asked curiously, “Mom, do you know this uncle?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Langhua nodded.

Ye Shu then explained the whole process to ye Langhua.

“Father Zhao nodded. “Yes, Ye Sen is my biological son.” ”

Ye Langhua’s face was filled with disbelief.

“After so many years, this was the first time she had heard that Zhao Zhenfei had a son. ”

What made ye Langhua even more incredulous was that this son was actually ye Sen!

It was truly a coincidence.

“Ye Langhua continued, “Have you done a paternity test?” ”

“Zhao Zhenfei was a person with many tricks up his sleeves. In order to achieve his goal, he would do anything. Who knew what he was planning this time! ”

“Moreover, Ye Zhuo had recently removed the name of the Zhao family from the Shunxi Financial Group! ”

“At such a critical moment, they had to be on guard! ”

“Father Zhao continued, “Although the results of the paternity test are not out yet, believe me, Ye Sen is really my biological son!” ”

Ye Langhua looked at Father Zhao. “Let’s wait for the paternity test report to come out first.”

“Just as everyone was talking, the ICU was bustling with work. ”

The doctors even used their face defibrillators.

“Seeing this scene, father Zhao’s eyes were filled with anxiety. “Don’t get hurt! A Ye, you mustn’t get hurt! If anything happens to you, let Daddy Live Like This!” ”
