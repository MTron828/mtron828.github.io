“”Sister Rong, you’re being too polite! Since I’ve decided to help you, I’m not afraid of being implicated!”After all, doing anything was risky.”

“”Xiao Wang, thank you.””

“”I should be the one thanking you, Sister Rong.”Xiao Wang was very grateful to Mu Yourong. If it wasn’t for Mu Yourong, she would already be a cripple.”

“After saying this, Xiao Wang continued, “Sister Rong, then I’ll arrange for you to enter the Lin family home now.””

“Yes.”Mu Yourong nodded.

On the other side.

In an office building.

“An assistant dressed in black stood in front of Song Shiyu and said respectfully, “Boss, Thunderstorm Pavilion has already found traces of Mu Yourong!””

Song Shiyu frowned slightly and tapped his fingers on the table. “Where is she now?”

“”Just as you thought, she was just about to make a move on Miss Ye.”.” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

PA —

A crisp sound suddenly rang out in the air.

The assistant raised his head and saw song Shiyu directly break the pen in his hand.

“”Bring it here,”song Shiyu continued.”

“Bring it to Wutong Garden?”The assistant asked.

“What do you think?”Song Shiyu raised his eyes slightly.

“The assistant suddenly shivered. “Okay boss, I got it!””

Song Shiyu narrowed his eyes.

“The next day, Mu Yourong took her fake ID card and went to the Lin family with little Wang.”

“Little Wang walked in front. “Sister Rong, when we reach the MU family, don’t say anything. I’ll tell you.””

“Okay.”Mu Yourong nodded.

The two of them talked as they walked. Little did they know that they had long been targeted.

“Mu Yourong sensed that something was wrong, but when she turned around, there was nothing behind her.”

Could it be an illusion?

“Mu Yourong turned around. Just then, she felt an intense pain on the left side of her neck, and then she blacked out.”

The person who had knocked Mu Yourong out gave a look to his companion beside him. His companion immediately understood and immediately helped his companion get Mu Yourong into the car beside them.

“The driver got the three of them into the car, immediately stepped on the accelerator, and left.”

“Little Wang did not notice that someone was missing. “Sister Rong, after you go to the MU family, you have to be careful. If you encounter any difficulties, just give me a call.””

“And...”

Little Wang turned around and realized that Mu Yourong was nowhere to be seen!

Where was Mu Yourong?

“Sister Rong! Sister Rong!”Little Wang shouted loudly.

But he did not receive a single reply from Mu Yourong.

How could mu Yourong suddenly disappear?

Could it be that something came up?

“Xiao Wang was very anxious. He immediately took out his phone and dialed Mu Yourong’s number. However, the other party’s phone had already been switched off.”

Could it be...

That something bad had happened to Mu Yourong?

“If something had happened to Mu Yourong, it was impossible for her phone to be switched off!”

“Xiao Wang took out his phone and wanted to call the police. Just as he pressed the three numbers 110, he immediately put his phone back into his pocket.”

No.

She couldn’t call the police.

“Mu Yourong was a fugitive to begin with. If she called the police, not only would it not be beneficial to Mu Yourong, it would even harm her.”

“At the moment, Xiao Wang could only use the connections she had at her side to try her best to find Mu Yourong!”

Western Suburbs.

Wutong Park.

“Despite the elegant name of Wutong Park and its artistic style, this was actually a madhouse.”

Song Shiyu was led into a sealed room by his assistant.

“”Boss, she’s inside.””

Song Shiyu pushed the door open.

Mu Yourong was tied to the sofa. Her mouth was sealed with tape and she was in a coma.

“”Wake her up.”Song Shiyu subconsciously lit a cigarette. The next second, as if he had thought of something, he extinguished the cigarette in his hand.”

“Yes.”

The assistant immediately got someone to get some ice water and splashed it on Mu Yourong’s face.

Whoosh —

“Although the heater was turned on in the room, it was winter after all. With this bucket of ice water, it was bone-chilling. Mu Yourong was immediately woken up. When she opened her eyes and saw the scene in front of her, she thought that she was hallucinating!”

Song Shiyu!

The person standing in front of her was actually song Shiyu!

How did song Shiyu appear here?

And where was this place?

No.

She could not be captured by a demon like song Shiyu.

“As soon as she saw song Shiyu’s face, Mu Yourong could not breathe. An overwhelming sense of fear pounced on her. That feeling was truly too uncomfortable!”

“Mu Yourong struggled with all her might, but the rope was too tight. She could not struggle at all.”

“Mu Yourong wanted to cry for help, but the tape on her face was so tight that she could not make a sound.”

What should she do?

What should she do now?
