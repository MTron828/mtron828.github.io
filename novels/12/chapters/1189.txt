“Milai’s current company was 25,000 yuan. ”

“Half a year’s salary was 150,000 yuan. ”

“If that was the case, she would not lose out. ”

“Thinking of the 150,000 yuan, Milai felt much better. ”

“Ye Zhuo turned his gaze slightly. “You want to settle the score? Then let’s settle the score properly, Ally.” ”

Allie nodded. She immediately took out a document and handed it to Millie. “Take a look for yourself.”

Millie stretched out her hand to receive the document.

She took a look.

“Her complexion, which had already improved, turned pale again. Her eyes were filled with disbelief. ”

She knew.

It turned out that ye Zhuo knew all of the little tricks she had done in private.

It was just that she did not say it out loud.

“At this moment, millet felt as if she was naked. ”

She had always thought that the things she had done were very clean.

She did not expect that ye Zao actually knew about it.

This feeling was not good at all.

“Millet’s legs went weak and she directly knelt on the ground, crying out, “I’m sorry! I was wrong! President Ye, I’m Leaving Now! Please let me off this time and don’t pursue my responsibility! I beg you!” ”

“Get lost!”Ye Zao’s red lips parted slightly.

Milai scrambled out of the office.

“Ye Zao turned to look at ye Sen. “Uncle, let’s go in.” ”

Ye Sen nodded and followed ye Zao in.

“Only when they reached the office did ye sen ask, “Niece, what’s with that Milai?” ” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Just a second ago, she was still clamoring for ye Zao to pay for the compensation. ”

“But in the next second, she ran away dejectedly. ”

He did not know what ye Zao was showing her.

Ye Sen was very curious.

“Ye Zao poured ye Sen a cup of tea, “She is Zhao Xueyin’s spy. On that document, all her faults are recorded. Once those matters are recorded in her personal file, it will be difficult for her to find a decent job in the future.” ”

“Her tone was very indifferent, as if she was discussing with Ye Sen what to eat the next morning. ”

“”Zhao Xueyin?”Ye Sen frowned, “Is she that Zhao family’s Daughter?” ”

Ye Sen also knew a little about the Shunxi Financial Group.

“”Yes.”Ye zhuo nodded slightly, “It’s her.” ”

“Ye Sen narrowed his eyes, “This little girl is really bad! She actually planted spies by your side! She didn’t bring you any losses, right?” ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Don’t worry, she didn’t.” ”

It was precisely because she didn’t bring any losses that ye Zao didn’t pursue Milai’s responsibility.

“It’s good that she didn’t.”

“Right at this moment, ye Sen seemed to have recalled something and continued to say, “The uncle who brought me to look for you just now couldn’t be Zhao Xueyin’s father, right?” ”

“What does he look like?”Ye Zao asked.

“Ye Sen said, “He’s thin and tall. He looks about 70 years old. There’s a black mole on the left side of his face.” ”

“”That’s right,”ye Zao continued, “He’s Zhao Zhenfei!” ”

“”Oh my God! I really couldn’t tell!”Ye Sen said in surprise, “He looks like a kind old man who likes to laugh!” ”

Who would have thought that such a person would actually do something like taking over a financial group after old ye left.

“”You can’t judge a book by its cover.”Ye Zhuo picked up the cup and drank a mouthful of water. “Oh right, uncle, how did you get here? Why didn’t you inform me in advance?” ”

“Ye Sen said, “I just happened to be here to do something and came by to see you. I called you, but your phone was turned off!” ”

“Turned off?”Ye Zhuo raised her eyebrows slightly and took out her phone from her pocket.

The screen was black!

Her phone was indeed turned off.

Xiao Bai must have secretly used her phone to use pesticide.

Ye Zao took the phone to charge it.

“Ye Sen walked around Ye Zao’s office. “Zao Zao, the scenery here is not bad! 58th floor, right?” ”

“”Yes.”Ye Zao continued, “If you like it, you can also move your office to the 58th floor.” ”

“”It’s too high for me. I’d better forget it.”Ye Sen walked over. “By the way, Zao Zao, I’ve been feeling dizzy and sleepy for the past few days. Can you take a look at it? What’s Wrong?” ”

“As Ye Sen spoke, he rolled up his sleeves and handed over his hand. ”

Ye Sen’s skin was very white.

“After rolling up his sleeves, a part of his fair skin was immediately revealed. The red birthmark on his arm was also very obvious. ”

“Ye Zhuo was stunned. “Uncle, what’s going on with your arm?” ”

“”Birthmark,”ye Sen’s tone was indifferent. ”

“”OH.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly and reached out to touch ye Sen’s pulse. After a moment, she continued, “There’s nothing wrong with you. It’s just that you haven’t been sleeping enough recently. You just need to sleep more.” ”

“That’s good.”Ye Sen heaved a sigh of relief.
