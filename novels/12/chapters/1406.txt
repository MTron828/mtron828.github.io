“Chapter 1407: 301: the Will has been successfully restored, and the truth has surfaced (14th watch)1”

Translator: 549690339

“Hearing this, Zhou Jinbei thought he was hearing things. ”

It was restored!

It was finally restored

“”Searing, is it true?”Zhou Jinbei asked. ”

“”Of course it’s true.”Ye searing said, “Where are you?” ”

“Zhou jinbei continued, “I’m at Shaoqing’s house.” ”

“”Alright, I’ll be there right away.” ”

“After hanging up the phone, Zhou Jinbei went downstairs. ”

“The moment he arrived downstairs, he saw Zhou Xiang kneeling in front of old Mrs. Cen. ”

Zhou Jinbei was stunned. “What’s going on?”

“Based on his understanding of old Mrs. Cen, she was definitely not the kind of person who would make Zhou Xiang kneel. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen stood up from the sofa, her expression already somewhat ugly. “Let your sister tell you.” ”

For her parents to kneel down to her like that.

Perhaps only Zhou Xiang would do that.

Old Mrs. Cen was really angry.

“She was still around, and she could still restrain Zhou Xiang. If she was not around, Zhou Xiang might do something stupid! ”

“Sister?”Zhou Jinbei looked at Zhou Xiang.

Zhou Xiang turned to look at Zhou Jinbei. “Father and mother transferred to another hospital. I begged mother to tell me the address of their transfer.”

“Zhou jinbei sighed and said, “SIS, get up First!” ”

“Zhou Xiang said, “If mom doesn’t tell me today, I won’t get up.” ”

Old Mrs. Cen shook her head helplessly.

“Zhou jinbei continued, “Sis, get up first. Mom’s will has been repaired. We’ll talk about it after we see the will.” ”

“Really?”Zhou Xiang raised her head to look at Zhou Jinbei with a face full of disbelief.

Even Old Madam Cen was a little surprised.

Ye Zao had said a week at that time. She did not expect that ye Zao would be able to repair the suicide note in just three or four days.

“”Of course it’s true!”Zhou jinbei said, “Would zao lie to me? Get Up quickly!” ”

Only then did Zhou Xiang stand up from the ground.

Very soon.

The sound of a car engine could be heard from outside.

Zhou Jinbei stood up from the sofa. “It must be searing!”

Old Mrs. Cen walked out. “I’ll go out and take a look!”

“Just as she walked out of the door, she saw Cen Shaoqing and ye Zao getting out of the car. ”

“”Searing!”Old Mrs. Cen said excitedly, “Searing, you’re finally here! Your uncle has been waiting for you for a long time!” ”

“Grandma Cen.”Ye Zao walked to Old Mrs. Cen’s side.

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Has that letter really been restored?” ”

“”Yes.”Ye Zha nodded. “To be precise, it should be a will.” ”

“Since ye Zha had restored the will, he naturally saw the contents of the will. ”

It would be a lie to say that he was not shocked.

The few of them came to the hall.

“When they saw Ye Zha, Zhou Jinbei immediately stood up from the sofa. “Zha Zha.” ”

“”Uncle, Aunty,”ye Zao greeted politely. ” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Zhou Jinbei couldn’t wait to ask, “Zao Zao, Where’s the letter?” ”

“Ye Zao said, “Uncle, before you read the letter again, you and Aunty have to make preparations.” ”

“Okay.”Zhou Jinbei nodded.

Ye Zao took out the will.

“Although it was restored, the will was still the same as before. There were no traces of restoration. ”

Zhou Jinbei carefully opened the medical skill.

What entered his eyes was a row of beautiful handwriting.

“Xiang Xiang, Jinbei, I’m sorry. ”

My mother was a bad mother.

“When I made this decision, my mother thought for three days and three nights. ”

“If I had a little courage to live, I would not choose this result. ”

I never understood before why someone would seek death.

“If they were not afraid of death, why would they be afraid of living? ”

The living would never understand why some people would do this.

Now.

“I finally know, because sometimes, it takes more courage to live than to die. ”

Mom is most worried about you now.

“Xiang Xiang, you are the elder sister. ”

“After mom leaves, you have to take good care of your younger brother, understand? ”

And Jinbei.

“In the future, when mom is not around, you are the younger brother. You have to listen to your elder sister, understand? ”

“If you don’t listen, Mom will be angry! ”

“Besides you, the people that mom has let down the most in this life are her grandparents. ”

Mom is too ashamed to see them now.

“Mom is not a good mother, and is not a good daughter. ”

“Xiangxiang, your grandparents have had a hard life. Please be filial to them in my place. ”

“Back then, your grandparents tried to stop me from being with Zhou Zuolong, but I always thought I was right. ”

I believe in my own judgment.

“When I saw that scene, I thought I was hallucinating. ”

“If it wasn’t a hallucination, how could your father, the love of my life, do such a thing? ”

Until the second time.

They were caught red-handed by me.

Everything that had been beautiful had become a joke.

“Your father and I, were in free love, and it was ironic how passionately we loved each other in the past. ”

I never dreamed that Zhou Zuolong would betray me.

“We loved each other passionately for more than a decade, but not as much as a woman he had known for more than a decade. ”

“When he slapped me, I knew it was over. ”

“When that woman showed off in front of me, I knew I had lost. ”

Completely.

“At that moment, my life lost its original meaning. ”

“By the way, that woman’s name is Xie Wanqiu. ”

Mom doesn’t want to die without knowing why.

“After I die, if your father lets that woman get into the family, you can go to your grandparents’house and beg your aunt and uncle. ”

“You are my only blood in the world, they will certainly not sit by and do nothing. ”

“Xiang Xiang, you are a girl. ”

“The most important thing for a girl is self-respect, self-respect, and good taste. ”

“You can not be like Xie wanqiu, meddling in other people’s marriages. ”

“And you can not be like your mother, who is blind and stupid. ”

“As the saying goes, if you don’t listen to the old people, you will be at a disadvantage in front of your eyes. ”

“When you reach marriageable age, you must listen to your grandparents more often. ”

They walk more bridges than you do.

It’s always right to listen to their opinions.

And to go north.

“Even though you’re a boy, you still have to learn self-respect, self-respect, self-reliance and self-improvement. ”

“As a man, not only should you take responsibility, but you should also support yourself and the people you love. ”

He should be even more loyal to his partner.

Don’t be like your father.

Finally.

I hope you will have a happy and peaceful life.

...

“In this life, you come and go naked. ”

“A suicide note, two full pages, full of Wu Lan’s helplessness. ”

She met Zhou Zuolong when she was eighteen.

She married Zhou Zuolong when she was 19.

“After marriage, they had a pair of children. She originally thought that she would be with the person she liked to keep a pair of children, happily staying together for a lifetime. ”

“She did not expect that in the end, what she received was a heart-wrenching betrayal. ”

“When she wrote this suicide note, Zhou Xiang and Zhou Jinbei slept next to her. ”

What about Zhou Zuolong?

Zhou Zuolong was drunk in a dream with Xie Wanqiu in a tender place.

“After writing this suicide note, Wu Lan changed into her favorite clothes, put on exquisite makeup, kissed the faces of the two children, and went to the railway track in the suburbs. ”

“When she lay on the track, she saw the gorgeous blue sky and white clouds. ”

The weather was very good.

It was very similar to the day she and Zhou Zuolong first met.

If only time could be reversed.

She would rather have never known Zhou Zuolong.

Hula —

The train whizzed by.

An elite teardrop streaked across the corner of Wu Lan’s eyes.

Her life had come to an end here.

“After reading a letter, Zhou Xiang’s face was already covered in tears. ”

“In the past, how much she trusted Zhou Zuolong was now how disgusting it was. ”

“She had never thought that her mother would end her life in this way, much less that Zhou Zuolong would do something that would let Wu Lan Down. “Mom, Mom! I’m sorry, I’m sorry to you...” ”

“Thinking about how she had misunderstood Wu Lan for so many years, Zhou Xiang was on the verge of breaking down. ”

“All the strength in her body was drained in that instant, and she collapsed to the ground, her heart filled with grief. ”

At that moment.

Zhou Xiang seemed to have returned to the year when she was 13 years old.

She was woken up by the butler in her sleep.

“Miss! Something Bad has happened!”

“”Madam, Madam, Madam has left!” ”

“In just one night, she had lost her most beloved mother. ”

“Little Zhou Xiang, who was only 13 years old, also understood what death meant for the first time. ”

“After so many years, when he saw Wu Lan’s handwriting again, Zhou Jinbei could not control his emotions. His entire body was trembling. “Mother...” ”

“Even though he had long prepared for Wu Lan’s death to be related to Zhou Zuolong, when he truly faced reality, he would still collapse. ”

Old Mrs. Cen sighed. “It’s such a pity for my mother-in-law. She was only 34 when she left...”

The person who should have left was still alive.

The person who should have been alive had become a pile of bones.

Fate played tricks on people!
