Ming Yao nodded and looked at the driver in front. “Let’s go.”

“”Yes, miss. .”The driver drove away. ”

“Seeing the black car disappear from her sight, the light in Zhao Xueyin’s eyes disappeared bit by bit. ”

She knew.

She was finished.

The lawyer was the only person she could rely on in this world.

Now.

She had no one to rely on.

“Zhao Xueyin walked on the street in a daze. She used the money to buy a phone card and sent a message to Si Lui’s cell phone. “Brother Si, I’m at the crossing bridge. If you don’t come to see me, I’ll jump down from here.” ”

She planned to make a final gamble.

She waited for a long time.

The sun set in the west.

The golden sun was coated with a layer of golden light on the thick snow. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Zhao Xueyin looked at the turbulent river beneath her feet, unable to put on any expression. ”

Jump?

She did not know.

“If she jumped, her life would be gone. ”

Not Jump?

What was the use of her remaining in this world?

Her family background was gone.

Her face was disfigured.

But at least she still had hope to live.

“If she died, even her last hope would be gone. ”

“Moreover, even if she died, she couldn’t just die. ”

She had to take ye Zao with her to die.

One Life for one life.

“This way, she wouldn’t be lonely on the road to Hell. ”

Right.

She had to take ye Zao with her.

“After all, it was that B * Tch ye Zao who had caused her to be like this. ”

“Zhao Xueyin narrowed her eyes. At this moment, she suddenly saw a familiar car. ”

That Was...

The lawyer’s car.

The lawyer was here.

Zhao Xueyin’s eyes were full of light.

She knew that the lawyer must still love her.

She had to let the lawyer experience the pain of losing the person she loved the most.

Only by losing once would she know how to cherish it.

She also had to make the lawyer regret it.

“After she jumped down, the lawyer would definitely jump down immediately to save her. ”

“Si Lu was a good swimmer. Based on the time, she would definitely be fine. ”

“With this thought in mind, Zhao Xueyin turned around and jumped down from the bridge. ”

Bam!

Water splashed everywhere.

“”She really jumped!”Ming Yao, who was sitting beside Si Lu, said in surprise. ”

Si Lu pulled over with a calm expression. “Did you call the police?”

“I did.”Ming Yao nodded.

“Then let’s wait for the police to come.”

“”You’re so cold,”Ming Yao said. ”

Si lui turned to look at Ming Yao. “Why? Do you still want me to cry for Zhao Xue?”

“The moment she jumped into the water, Zhao Xue Yin only felt a vast expanse of whiteness in front of her eyes. Countless water rushed into her nose, throat, and finally her lungs. She couldn’t breathe, and the more she struggled, the more she sank. ”

Why hasn’t Si lui come yet?

Why isn’t he here yet?

Why isn’t he jumping down to save her? !

“If the lawyer doesn’t come soon, she will die. ”

“Zhao Xueyin continued to struggle, and in the end, the water droplets became smaller and smaller... ... until they completely sank to the bottom of the water. ”

“At this moment, the sound of police sirens rang out by the bridge. ”

“A few good-natured police officers took a speedboat down the river, but what they brought up was a yellow body bag. ”

“When Zhao Zhenfei, who was in prison, heard the news, not only was he not angry, he was relieved instead. ”

He was dead.

It was good that he was dead.

“If he was dead, he would not have to worry about someone scheming against ye sen. “My son, father can finally rest in peace this time!” ”

...

On the other side.

At the CEN residence.

“Zhou Xiang’s stepmother, Xie wanqiu, and niece, Zheng Wanyin, had been staying at the CEN residence. ”

“”Xiang Xiang.”After dinner, Xie Wanqiu went to Zhou Xiang’s room. ”

“”Why are you here?”Zhou Xiang was applying a facial mask. When she saw Xie wanqiu, she quickly stood up from the Imperial Consort’s chair. ”

“Looking at the black facial mask on Zhou Xiang’s face, Xie wanqiu frowned slightly. ”

He was not a woman!

This man had been dead for so many years. She did not know who Zhou Xiang was showing off to every day.

“He was already so old, yet he was still putting on a mask. ”

He was not afraid of being laughed at by others.

No one knew why the Cen family had chosen Zhou Xiang in the first place.

“Zheng Wanyin’s mother, her biological eldest daughter, was a hundred times prettier than Zhou Xiang! ”

“Why? Can’t I come if there’s nothing else?”Xie wanqiu asked in return.

“”No, you’ve misunderstood.”Zhou Xiang took off the mask on his face. “Please sit down.” ”

“Xie wanqiu took the opportunity to sit down and continued, “I came over to discuss yinyin’s matter with you.” ”

“Wanyin? What’s wrong with Wanyin?”Zhou Xiang asked.

Xie wanqiu looked at Zhou Xiang and took the initiative to strike first. “How did you become her second aunt? !”

“Zhou Xiang’s heart skipped a beat. “You know that I don’t know how to read people’s minds. If you have something to say, just say it.” ”

“”Wan Yin is already 25 this year. As her second aunt, didn’t you think of introducing her to someone else? Are you going to watch her become an old lady?” ”
