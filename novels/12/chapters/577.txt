“Looking at the two suitcases, Zhao shuning finally realized that this was not a dream.”

She was really going to be kicked out of the Lin family.

The people who were going to be kicked out of the Lin family should be ye Shu and Ye Zhuo.

How did it suddenly become her?

Zhao shuning kept backing away.

No.

She didn’t want to leave the Lin family.

“Lin Qingxuan looked at Zhao shuning and said calmly, “Tomorrow Morning at nine o’clock, I’ll wait for you at the entrance of the Civil Affairs Bureau. If you don’t come, I’ll ask the lawyer to pass the divorce papers to you.””

“Since they had already come this far, Lin Qingxuan didn’t want to hesitate anymore.”

He had to cut the Gordian knot quickly.

“”Qingxuan, we’ve been husband and wife for 21 years. Do you really have no feelings for me at all?”Zhao shuning said with a choked voice, “Is the child that important to you? I can tolerate that you can’t have children, so why can’t you understand me for once? Do I deserve to be used as a reproductive tool for your Lin Family?””

“”Do you think the problem between us is that who can’t have children? “If you hadn’t Lied to me twenty-one years ago, we wouldn’t be where we are today! “Zhao shuning, think about what kind of life I’ve been living in the past twenty-one years!””

“He would get slapped, kneel down, and not be able to talk to the opposite sex... ... and still live in guilt for Zhao shuning.”

Lin Qingxuan felt that he had had enough of these days.

All he wanted now was to be free.

Zhao shuning closed her eyes.

She thought that Lin Qingxuan was willing to do those things for her.

She didn’t expect that.

“Every single thing, every single thing, he remembered...”

“Old Lady Lin held onto Lin Qingxuan’s wrist. “Qingxuan, why are you still talking to this B * Tch! Xiao Liu, Xiao Wang, quickly send her to the Zhao family!””

Xiao Liu and Xiao Wang pulled Zhao shuning up from the ground.

Zhao shuning struggled violently. “I’m not going! I’m not going anywhere! This is my home! None of you have the right to chase me away! Lin Qingxuan! B * Stard! You’re not human!”

Twenty-one years of being together had finally come to an end.

Aunt Zhang stood at the side and watched this scene with her brows furrowed.

Who would have thought that something would happen to Zhao shuning all of a sudden?

“Without Zhao shuning, Feng Qianhua would lose a capable assistant.”

This incident was a blow to Feng Qianhua.

Zhao shuning was sent to the Zhao family overnight.

“Zhao Shuqi had just lost his job because of Zhao shuning, and the Zhao family had suffered heavy losses. The Zhao family was no longer the same as before. Now that Zhao Shuning had been sent back by the Lin family, Father Zhao was already seriously ill in bed. When he saw Zhao shuning now.., he was so angry that his face turned pale.”

“”I knew that something would happen sooner or later!”Father Zhao casually picked up the table lamp on the bedside table and smashed it on the ground, “What did I tell you? I told you not to do it! There is no man who doesn’t like women who are gentle and petty! As long as you treat Qingxuan a little better, you wouldn’t have gotten to where you are today!””

Madam Zhao wiped away her tears at the side.

They already knew that it was Zhao shuning who was infertile.

“At that time, they had advised Zhao shuning not to go overboard. The truth would come out one day, but Zhao shuning insisted on doing it.”

It was all Zhao Shuning’s fault that she had gotten to where she was today.

She couldn’t blame anyone.

“Father Zhao pointed at Zhao shuning and said, “Get lost! Get lost! Our Zhao family doesn’t have such an embarrassing thing like you!””

“Madam Zhao said in tears, “Shuning is already like this now. Do you want to watch her live on the streets?”” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Breaking the bones and connecting the scriptures.

“No matter how many mistakes Zhao shuning had made, they couldn’t change the fact that she was their daughter.”

Father Zhao sighed. “Clean up the guest room on the third floor.”

“Okay! Okay! I’ll go now!”Madam Zhao was overjoyed.

Guest Room.

“When she heard these two words, no expression could be seen in Zhao shuning’s eyes.”

“It turned out that in the Zhao family, she had already fallen to the point where she could only stay in the guest room.”

Lin family.

“Old Lady Lin held Lin Qingxuan’s hand and said with tears streaming down her face, “Qingxuan, it’s mom who has let you down. Mom has let you down... if it wasn’t for mom who made you marry that B * Tch Zhao shuning back then, this wouldn’t have happened...””

Twenty-one years.

“For twenty-one years, Old Mrs. Lin hated herself for not finding out the truth earlier.”

“”Damn it, qingxuan, it’s all my fault! It’s all my fault!”No one knew how regretful old Mrs. Mo was now.”

“”Mom, don’t mention the past anymore.”No matter how much she apologized, the past twenty-one years would never happen again. “Mom, you have to thank Zhuoluo for this.””
