Cen Hai nodded. “I just heard director Zhao and master five talking on the phone. That’s what they said.”

“Hearing that, Cen Hu ran over from area A. “What are you guys talking about? Miss Ye is coming?””

“”F * ck! Are you serious? Miss ye is coming to our base? When? I’m leaving work in two minutes. No, I have to find professor Yue and work for another two hours!””

“Where is Miss Ye?”

“Soon, Cen Jiang and Cen Hai were surrounded by a group of people.”

“Ever since ye Zao came to the base last time, he had become the legend of the base.”

“One minute to crack the laser beam in Area C, and three minutes to fix the flaws in the design drawings.”

“Not to mention in this base, even if they searched all over China, they would not be able to find a second person.”

Many people who had never seen ye Zao could not wait to see him once.

“When Tang Xue passed by the technology department, she happened to see this scene. She frowned slightly and felt a little uncomfortable.”

“Until now, she still did not understand how ye Zao could be so powerful.”

“From the entertainment industry to the technology industry, to the live broadcast industry, Ye Zao had dabbled in all of them, and they were all very outstanding.”

“It was as if there was nothing in this world that she did not want to do, and nothing that she could not do well.”

“Tang Xue looked at the village 2 that ye Zao had starred in, and there were even comments under the comments that Ye Zao was a world-crossing master.”

But was this really ye Zao’s true ability?

Was there really such a perfect person in the world?

“Before ye Zao appeared, Tang Xue was the most popular person in the base. However, ever since ye Zao appeared, the radiance on Tang Xue seemed to have disappeared all of a sudden.”

“In the past, the most common words she heard were, “Sister Xue is so amazing!””

“Sister Xue is going to break the record again!” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Your sister Xue is still your sister Xue!”

And Now?

“The most common words she heard were, “If only Miss Ye were here!””

“Miss Ye will definitely be able to solve this problem!”

“I wonder if Miss Ye will join our laboratory.”

“Miss Ye...”

“No matter what happened, everyone habitually compared her to Ye Zao.”

The word “Ye Zao”had now become Tang Xue’s nightmare.

“Actually, this was not anyone’s fault.”

“There were not many girls in the laboratory to begin with. After everyone witnessed ye Zao’s abilities and saw other girls, they would subconsciously compare the two of them.”

“Thinking of this, Tang Xue bit her lip. Her eyes were filled with unwillingness, but she still tried her best to act as if nothing had happened. She walked in front of everyone and said with a smile, “Is Miss Ye Coming?””

Cen Jiang hurriedly nodded. “That’s right. Miss Ye is coming!”

“Tang Xue said, “That’s great. Once Miss Ye comes, we’ll have a backbone.””

“Cen Hu said, “Do you guys think that Miss Ye is more powerful, or is the Big Boss YC from the science and technology world more powerful?””

“Hearing this, there was a moment of silence in the air.”

Everyone knew that YC was a big boss in the science and technology world.

It was also the dark horse that crushed c nation in the science and technology competition.

“Although ye Zhuo was very powerful, she had not entered the science and technology competition before after all.”

Tang Xue did not say anything. A strange look flashed in her eyes.

“Jiang Yue said, “It should be YC boss who is more powerful, right? After all, he is the boss who crushed C Nation...””

“Tang Xue smiled and said, “As a girl, Miss Ye is also very impressive. Not everyone can reach the level of YC Boss.””

“”Sister Xue is right.”Cen Hai nodded. “After all, Boss is a boss. But Miss Ye is also very powerful. At the very least, there is no one in our base who is more powerful than her!””

“Right.”

Di —

“At this moment, the laboratory door was opened.”

Two figures walked in from outside.

“”Master Five, Miss Ye.””

Everyone immediately went up to welcome them.

“Cen Hu looked at Cen Hai by the side, he lowered his voice and said, “Is this the legendary Miss Ye? She looks so young! I don’t know what brand of skincare products she uses. I’ll ask her later and buy a set for my girlfriend.”Such a powerful skincare product.., his girlfriend would definitely be ten years younger after using it.”

“”It’s not that she looks young. She’s already young,”Cen Hai said. “Miss Ye is only twenty years old this year.””

“Twenty years old?”Cen Hu exclaimed. “Nine years younger than sister Xue?”

“He had thought that ye Zao was definitely older than Tang Xue. After all, ye Zao’s strength was evident here.”

He did not expect that ye Zao was even younger than Tang Xue!

How on earth did she do it so well?

“”Yes,”cen hai continued, “That’s why I said that Miss Ye is amazing and promising at a young age!””
