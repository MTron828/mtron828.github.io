Chapter 150: 085: The Smart Lin Ze, who was at the peak of his career! 2

His computer was very light.

It was light in his hands and didn’t seem to carry much weight.

“Grandpa Butler, can you tell me why Grandma suddenly asked me to go back?”

The Butler turned to look at Lin Ze. “Young master, do you really not know?”

“I don’t know.”Lin Ze shook his head in confusion.

It was as if he didn’t know anything.

The Lin family had their own plane.

After arriving at the airport, the plane flew directly to Beijing.

On the way, Lin Ze’s face didn’t have any special expression. He had been playing with his computer.

When he returned to Beijing, it was already past one o’clock in the morning.

The Lin family manor was brightly lit.

Lin Ze had just walked into the hall.

A Cup flew over.

“Bang!”

The cup fell to the ground and shattered in front of him.

Lin Ze narrowed his eyes and continued walking inside.

He saw Old Mrs. Lin sitting on the sofa angrily, her face dark.

“What happened to Grandma?”Lin Ze walked over with a smile and sat beside Old Mrs. Lin. “Who made our matriarch angry?”

“Speak!”Old Madam Lin’s face was cold. “Where did you go?”

Lin Ze did not hide it. “I went to Yun Jing!”

“What are you going to Yun Jing for?”Old Madam Lin could not contain her anger. “Do you still have a grandmother in your eyes?”

She had grown wings!

Now, she even dared to carry her to Yun Jing.

Shouldn’t the next step be to bring that B * Tch Ye Shu back?

Lin Ze was stunned. He frowned and said, “Grandma, what are you talking about? I just went to Yun Jing with my classmates to play. Why Do I not see you as my grandma? Can’t I go to Yun Jing?”

“Didn’t you say that you were going to sea city?”Old Mrs. Lin looked at Lin Ze.

Lin Ze explained, “Originally, we were going to sea city, but my classmate said that the Fairy Peak in Yun Jing is the Best Mountain in the world. Moreover, he has relatives there, so he changed his mind and went to Yun Jing at the last minute! “Grandma, we went to Fairy Peak yesterday afternoon. It’s so beautiful! “We even took a photo. See if it looks good!”

With that, Lin Ze took out a photo.

In the background of the photo was Fairy Peak, a famous scenic spot in Yunjing.

Looking at the photo, Old Mrs. Lin’s frown eased a little.

Was this child really going to Yunjing just for a trip?

Was she mistaken?

But it was normal. No one in this family had ever told Lin ze anything about ye Shu.

For no reason.

How could this child know that ye Shu was in Yun Jing!

Maybe she was too sensitive!

“Who is this?”Old Mrs. Lin pointed at the stranger in the photo and asked.

Lin Ze introduced, “This is the relative of my classmate! This is the cousin of my classmate, this is my classmate, and this is the classmate of my classmate’s relative!”

Old Mrs. Lin nodded.

She also had some impression of this classmate of Lin Ze’s.

His family background was not bad. Although it could not be compared to the Lin family, his family background in Beijing could be counted on one’s fingers.

Old Mrs. Lin did not object. Lin Ze interacted with this classmate. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

After saying that, Lin ze continued, “Grandma, why did you suddenly ask the butler to call me back? Is there something urgent?”

An awkward smile appeared on Old Lady Lin’s face. “There’s nothing urgent. I was just afraid that something would happen to you. Didn’t you say that you were going to sea city? You suddenly went to Yun Jing. Grandma was afraid that you would be deceived!”

Lin Ze said guiltily, “This is also my fault! I’m a big gambler. I forgot everything when I saw Fairy Peak. I should have told you in advance! Oh, Grandma, I also bought you a bunch of crystal beads that have been exposed to light. The layman of the Fairy Peak said that these crystal beads that have been exposed to light are especially good for the elderly and keep them safe. See if you like them.”

With that, Lin Ze took out a small wooden box from his school bag.

This bunch of crystal beads indeed came from the fairy peak.

But it wasn’t bought by Lin Ze at the Fairy Peak.

Because Lin Ze had never been to Fairy Peak.

He photoshopped the photos.

Whether it was the crystal bracelet or the photos, Lin Ze had prepared them in advance.

Just in case.

He didn’t expect it to come in handy!

Ever since he saw the way Feng Qianhua and Feng Xianxian treated old Mrs. Lin, Lin Ze knew that he had to put on a good show with his grandmother.

After all, Feng Xianxian could make her smile with three pairs of insoles that cost ten yuan.

It turned out that.

He had done the right thing.

This was a very practical move for old Mrs. Lin.

Lin Ze narrowed his eyes.
