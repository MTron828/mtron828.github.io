“Xu Xiao smiled and said, “He said he wants to wait for me.” ”

“”See! Am I right? I knew he ziteng would definitely wait for you!”Mother Xu continued, “But Xiaoxiao, don’t let he ziteng wait too long. Men aren’t very patient.” ”

“Waiting for a day or two, a month or two months, was enough to whet he ziteng’s appetite, but if he had to wait for a year or so, he would probably be beaten to a pulp. ”

“Xu Xiao said, “Mom, he said that he will wait for me for ten years, twenty years. As long as I turn back, he will always be there. If I agree to him so quickly, wouldn’t that be too cheap!” ”

“”Ten years or twenty years?”Mother Xu said in surprise, “He ziteng really said that?” ”

“Of course!”Xu Xiao nodded very seriously. “Can I Lie to You?”

“”My Daughter is really amazing!”Having such a powerful daughter, mother Xu was also honored and proud, “Then how long do you plan to make him wait?” ”

“”I can’t wait too long,”father xu said, “This kind of thing pays attention to moderation and must not backfire. Xiaoxiao, you have to have a limit yourself.” ”

“Xu Xiao nodded, “Dad, I know.” ”

“”Little Miss, the eldest miss is looking for you.”At this moment, the Butler came down from upstairs. ”

“In this house, Xu Xiao could only be called little miss, and the eldest miss was Xu Chaonan. ”

“Okay.”Xu Xiao nodded and turned to walk upstairs to the study.

Xu Chaonan stood in front of the French window in the study and waited for Xu Xiao.

Xu Xiao reached out and knocked on the door. “Auntie.”

“Come in.”

“Xu Xiao lifted her foot and walked in. “Auntie, is there something you need me for?” ”

“Xu Chaonan turned to look at Xu Xiao and walked over to the chair beside him to sit down. “Xiao Xiao, I’ve already heard about you and he ziteng.” ”

“”Among the rich and powerful, he ziteng is indeed a rather outstanding existence. However, he hates lying the most. If one day he finds out about what you did to him, will he still love you as much as he does now?” ”

“Although Xu Chaonan did not say anything, it did not mean that she did not know anything. ”

Xu Xiao had used a lot of tricks in order to attract he ziteng’s attention.

“Xu Xiao was her biological niece. As an aunt, she could not watch as Xu Xiao fell into the abyss step by step. ”

The love that was cheated could not last long.

“This was not responsible for herself, but also for he ziteng. ”

“Hearing this, Xu Xiao did not say anything. ”

She felt a little uncomfortable.

“No matter what, Xu Chaonan was still her aunt, but Xu Chaonan did not care about the feelings of his aunt and nephew. ”

“Other People’s aunts encouraged their nieces, but Xu Chaonan added insult to injury. ”

“Xu Xiao said, “Aunt, I know that you’re doing this for my own good, but I really like he ziteng. I want to use my own way to keep him. Moreover, I don’t think there’s anything shameful about this method.” ”

To be able to use such methods to make he ziteng completely devoted to her was also a kind of ability.

“Xu Chaonan looked at Xu Xiao. “Xiaoxiao, aunt doesn’t have any children. In the future, aunt will have to leave everything to you. Therefore, aunt has high hopes for you.” ”

“Speaking up to this point, Xu Chaonan’s gaze changed. ”

“”Aunt hopes that you can become a towering tree, and not a dodder flower that lives on a big tree.” ”

“The He family’s name was indeed well-known in the capital, but those were fought over by the older generation and had nothing to do with Xu Xiao. ” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Once he ziteng and Xu Xiao abandoned Xu Xiao, Xu Xiao would have nothing left, just like a dodder flower that lost a big tree. ”

Dodder flower?

Xu Xiao felt that Xu Chaonan was somewhat laughable.

“It turned out that in Xu Chaonan’s eyes, she was a dodder flower. ”

“”Aunt, I know what you are worried about.”Xu Xiao tried her best to suppress the anger in her heart and continued, “But please rest assured, I will definitely not let you down.”He ziteng loved her so much, so how could he abandon her? Fine ”

“Xu Chaonan’s expression did not change, he continued, “Since you already have a choice in your heart, then Auntie will respect your choice. However, Auntie will still say that unorthodox methods are not acceptable. If you want to conquer he ziteng, you have to use your own personality and charm.” ”

“”I know, Auntie.”Xu Xiao nodded. “Do you have anything else?” ”

“”No,”Xu Chaonan said. ”

“Xu Xiao continued, “If you don’t have anything else, then I’ll go downstairs first.” ”

“You go.”

“Xu Xiao turned around and left. Looking at Xu Xiao’s back, Xu Chaonan’s eyes were filled with worry. ”

She was afraid that Xu Xiao would be at a disadvantage.

But Xu Xiao’s current appearance was clearly that she would not turn back until she hit the wall.
