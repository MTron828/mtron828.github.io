“Ye Shu nodded. “Okay then, send your luggage to your room first. Come downstairs to help after you get some rest.””

“Okay.”

The eastern courtyard had always kept ye Sen’s room.

“Ye Sen came to the room and put away his luggage. Then, he went to the main hall and cut the window flowers with ye Zao.”

“Although Ye Sen was a big man, his hands were very skillful. He cut the flowers beautifully with one hand, which made the five little guys exclaim, “Great-uncle, you’re really amazing!””

“Ye Sen said with a proud face, “Of course. Otherwise, why would I be your great-uncle?””

“”Great-uncle, can you cut an aunt?””

“”Yes, no problem.””

Ye Sen took the red paper and scissors and walked around casually. A small portrait of ye Zao appeared.

“It was so lifelike that it looked real. Even ye Zao was surprised when he saw it. “I didn’t expect you to know this, uncle.””

“Ye Sen smiled and said, “Big niece, I don’t want to brag, but there are many things you didn’t expect!””

Ye Zao took the small portrait and took a photo and sent it to Cen Shaoqing.

[ does it look good? ]

Cen Shaoqing was reading the Buddhist scriptures when he heard the voice on wechat. He immediately picked up his phone and saw the picture that ye Zhuo sent.

It was a small portrait cut out of red paper.

It was vivid and beautiful. Cen Shaoqing recognized that it was ye Zhuo at a glance.

[ it looks good. ]

“After Cen Shaoqing sent a message, he sent another message. -LSB- leader, did you cut this? ]”

[ my uncle cut it. How is it? Is My Uncle Good? ]

[ very good. ]

“After sending these three words, Cen Shaoqing felt a little depressed.”

He also wanted ye Zhuo to praise him.

Cen Shaoqing put his phone on the table and walked downstairs.

Today was the New Year’s Eve.

“At this time, Old Mrs. Cen and Zhou Xiang were also busy cutting the window flowers downstairs.”

“Although the CEN family had four daughters, three of them were married and had their own families. They were in their own families for the New Year and would only come back to pay their new year greetings on the first day of the New Year, therefore, only old Mrs. Cen, Zhou Xiang, Cen Shaoqing, and Cen Yuyan were at home.”

“However, Cen Yuyan had not returned yet.”

“”Grandma, Mom.”Cen Shaoqing walked in front of the two of them.”

Old Mrs. Cen raised her head and looked at Cen Shaoqing. “Why are you down here?”

“I’m here to help you.”

Help?

That was a new word.

“Cen Shaoqing had always been a person who had no desires or desires. The New Year was no different from any other day for him. When others stuck couplets, he would read Buddhist scriptures upstairs. When others cut window flowers, he would still read Buddhist scriptures.”

Old Mrs. Cen looked Cen Shaoqing up and down. “You’re here to help us?”

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly and picked up a pair of scissors. “I’ll help you cut window flowers together.” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Cut window flowers?

“Zhou Xiang stretched out her hand to check Cen Shaoqing’s forehead and said strangely, “I don’t have a fever either.””

“Cen Shaoqing looked at Old Mrs. Cen. “Grandma, Can you tell me about the skill of cutting window flowers?””

“Old Mrs. Cen asked suspiciously, “Do you really want to Learn?””

Cen Shaoqing nodded.

“Old Mrs. Cen saw that Cen Shaoqing did not look like he was joking, so she began to teach Cen Shaoqing how to cut the window-cutting flowers.”

Cen Shaoqing listened very carefully.

“Twenty minutes later, he went upstairs with the scissors and the red paper.”

“Zhou Xiang looked at Cen Shaoqing’s back. “Mom, do you think Shaoqing has been possessed?””

Old Mrs. Cen narrowed her eyes. “I think this matter has something to do with Yezi.”

Zhou Xiang nodded in agreement.

“At this moment, footsteps could be heard from outside.”

Cen Yuyan had returned with her luggage.

Cen Yuyan usually did not stay in the Cen family’s old residence. She would only stay for a few days during the New Year.

“”Mom, Grandma!””

“Yuyan is back!”Zhou Xiang stood up.

Cen Yuyan walked over and hugged Zhou Xiang before hugging old Mrs. Cen. She then took out the new year gifts that she had prepared for Zhou Xiang and old Mrs. Cen.

“Old Mrs. Cen took the gifts that Cen Yuyan had bought. “If you are so solicitous for no reason, you must be up to no good. Fourth Girl, you must have something to ask of us, right?””

“Cen Yuyan was already in her thirties this year, but she had never bought any gifts for her family.”

Would the sun rise from the West?

Of course not!

“So, there must be something hidden here!”

“Cen Yuyan pursed her lips. “Grandma, I’m being filial to all of you! What kind of person do you think I am? Buying something for you is asking for something from you?””

“Zhou Xiang smiled. “Mom, maybe the fourth girl has really grown up!””

“As a mother, Zhou Xiang was very happy to receive her daughter’s new year gift. She was not as considerate as Old Lady Cen.”
