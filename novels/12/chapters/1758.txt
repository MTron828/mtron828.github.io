Feng Ying never thought that her own grandmother would poison her.

Her own grandmother!

This was her own grandmother!

“A tiger would never eat its own son, let alone a human. ”

Did she even have a shred of humanity?

No!

She wouldn’t!

“The old lady was her own grandmother, she wouldn’t do that. ”

Feng Ying tried hard to calm herself down.

“The old lady just looked at Feng Ying, “It’s exactly because you are my biological granddaughter that I have to help you! I Can’t just watch you walk down the same path as Feng Qi! You were born in China, grew up in China, and now you have to die in China!”Even if she had to die.., the old lady could not let Feng Ying betray her country and make people laugh at her. ”

The old lady would never allow two traitors to appear in the Feng family!

Die in China?

“Hearing these words, Feng Ying was completely flustered! ”

Could it be that the old lady had really made up her mind to kill her?

No.

She wouldn’t.

The old lady was joking with her.

“”Grandma!”Feng Ying clutched her chest and endured the pain in her abdomen as she walked to the old lady’s side, she cried, “Grandma, you’re joking with me, right? I’m your only granddaughter in this world. You Can’t Bear for me to die, right?” ”

“”I’m not joking with you. Not only is it poisonous, it’s also extremely poisonous.”The old lady’s face gradually turned pale. “Feng Ying, this is your fate. Accept it.” ”

Everything was fate. It was not up to anyone. The old lady did not want this to happen.

“After saying this, the old lady looked at Feng Ying and continued, “Even if I spare your life now, you won’t have a good ending in the future! Instead of being despised by others in the future, why don’t You Leave Now?” ”

“Since ancient times, how many good endings did traitors have? ”

“Feng Ying immediately broke down. The pain in her abdomen became more and more obvious. She almost fainted from the pain and shouted hysterically, “Feng Shujing! You’re not human! You’re not human! Where’s the antidote? Quickly give me the antidote!” ”

The old lady did not say anything. She just looked at Feng Ying without any expression in her eyes.

She never thought that her old age would end like this.

“Fortunately, it was about to end. ”

Everything was about to end! Damn it

“”Quick, give me the antidote.”Feng Ying knelt on the ground, crying and begging the old lady, “Grandma, Grandma! I beg you, please spare me. I don’t want the Pure Jade anymore, and I Won’t return to C Nation anymore! I swear, if I break my oath, I will be struck by lightning! “Grandma, I will always be with you in the future!” ”

“”It’s too late.”The old lady shook her head. “Feng Ying, if you knew this would happen, why did you do it in the first place?” ”

There were some things that could be done. There was no use regretting it.

“As the more intense abdominal cramps came, Feng Ying was close to despair. ”

She was only thirty-two years old.

Her life had just begun.

Was she really going to die like this?

She couldn’t die!

She couldn’t die!

She couldn’t die.

“She wanted to live, and she wanted to become the vice-minister of the International Fashion Department. ”

She wanted to make a name for herself in the international fashion department!

She wanted to make all those who had looked down on her regret.

“Just then, Feng Ying suddenly saw a cell phone on the coffee table. ”

Feng Ying’s eyes lit up.

The hospital.

She had to go to the hospital immediately. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The only thing that could save her now was the hospital.

“Feng Ying endured the pain in her abdomen, walked to the coffee table, picked up the cell phone, and called 120 emergency. ”

“The old lady looked at her actions and smiled. “It’s useless. There’s no cure for this poison. In ten minutes at most...”in ten minutes, they would meet on the road to the netherworld. ”

“Feng Ying broke down completely when she heard this, but she still steadied herself. Her voice was trembling, “Hello, 120 Emergency Center? My Name Is Feng Ying. I’m poisoned now. My stomach hurts and I keep vomiting blood. Quickly send an ambulance over.” ”

“”Yes, Ma’am. What’s Your Address?” ”

“”Affordable villa, A16.” ”

“”We’ll arrange for an ambulance to come here immediately. Ma’am, please keep your phone open.”Then, the customer service representative gave Feng Ying some first-aid measures for poisoning. ”

“”Okay.”Feng Ying nodded. “Okay, I got it.” ”

“After hanging up the phone, Feng Ying picked up the first-aid kit on the first floor and began to operate according to the customer service representative’s instructions. ”

“Halfway through the first-aid measures, Feng Ying suddenly felt that the abdominal pain symptoms had lessened quite a bit, and she no longer vomited blood. ”

It worked.

It really worked!

It seemed that she didn’t have to die.

“Thinking of this, Feng Ying was ecstatic. ”
