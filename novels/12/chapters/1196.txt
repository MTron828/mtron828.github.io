“Chapter 1197: 256: the lawyer suddenly came to his senses! Face slapping, Grandpa Five’s vest dropped all over the floor! 6”

Translator: 549690339

Zhao Xueyin was stunned.

The expression on her face was a little ugly.

What was the lawyer doing?

Proposing?

Why couldn’t he have any self-awareness at all.

Even a little!

“As long as the lawyer had a little self-awareness, he wouldn’t do such a ridiculous thing! ”

“In the current situation, Zhao Xueyin could only temporarily accept the flowers from the lawyer and then think of a way to stabilize the lawyer’s emotions. ”

“Just as Zhao Xueyin was about to reach out to take the flowers, a glimmer of light suddenly flashed in her eyes. ”

This was the camera’s flash.

Someone was secretly taking pictures of her!

“Realizing this problem, Zhao Xueyin quickly looked around. When she looked around, her face was a little pale. ”

Who was that?

Li Zhaoyang!

“Master five had already misunderstood her relationship with the lawyer. If she accepted the lawyer’s flowers under such circumstances, it would really be hard to explain. ”

No.

Things could not go on like this.

She had to draw a clear line with the lawyer in front of Li Zhaoyang.

“”Marry you? What are you thinking? Why do you think I will marry you?”Zhao Xueyin looked at the lawyer, her eyes were full of sarcasm. “Why don’t you look at yourself in the mirror and see what kind of person you are! Which part of your body do you think is worthy of me?”The only person who was worthy of her.., was Master Wu! ” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Besides Master Wu, no one else was worthy of her. ”

Since they had already fallen out.

Then there was no need to show any mercy.

They should constantly be in trouble.

“She was the daughter of the Zhao family, and Si lui was just a worker. Si lui was not worthy of her. ”

“You finally said it.”The lawyer laughed.

“Zhao Xueyin continued, “If you know what’s good for you, you should resign and leave. Otherwise, I’ll do it myself and embarrass everyone!” ”

“The lawyer took a deep breath. “You’ve wanted to do this for a long time, right?” ”

Zhao Xueyin lowered her voice. “You can only blame yourself for not knowing your place!”

“As long as the lawyer knew his place, he would not think that she liked him. ”

She had never said that she liked the lawyer.

All of this was because the lawyer was self-righteous.

“”Yes, I was too stupid...”the lawyer’s mouth was full of self-mockery. “Zhao Xueyin, I have done so much for you. Aren’t you even a little touched?” ”

“”You volunteered, why should I be touched?”Perhaps afraid that Li Chaoyang heard something, Zhao Xueyin’s voice was a little low. “Lawyer, to tell you the truth, I have tolerated you for a long time!” ”

“After saying this, Zhao Xueyin took her things and turned to leave. ”

Without a trace of hesitation.

Si looked at her back and fiercely smashed the Roses on the ground.

Bang —

Bright red petals scattered all over the ground.

“Si was so upset that he wanted to shout, but he had no choice but to suppress his emotions. ”

“”Sir, do you need help?”The waiter in the restaurant walked over and asked. ”

“”No need.”Si Lu took out a stack of RMB from his wallet and placed it on the dining table. Then, he turned around and walked out of the door. ”

“The waiter picked up the diamond ring on the table. “Sir, you forgot to take your item.” ”

“Throw it away.”Si Lu said without turning his head.

His voice was not as energetic as before. It was weak.

It was as if he had been struck by something.

The waiter was stunned.

“Such an expensive diamond ring, and he threw it away just like that? ”

“After a moment, the waiter quickly chased after him. “Sir...” ”

The lawyer turned around angrily. “I said throw it away! Don’t you understand human language?”

The waiter was shocked.

“Before she could react, the lawyer had already left the restaurant. ”

The lawyer seemed to have returned to the morning.

He walked alone on the noisy street like a toy that had been abandoned.

“However, this time, he felt even worse than in the morning. ”

“In the morning, he could even use his misunderstanding of Zhao Xueyin as an excuse to comfort himself. ”

And Now?

What was he going to use to comfort himself?

“Ah!”

“The lawyer looked up at the sky and roared, venting out all his emotions. ”

That night.

The lawyer didn’t know how he got through it.

He probably didn’t sleep at all.

“The next day, he went to the Shunxi Financial Group to go through the resignation procedures. ”

“When the personnel department staff learned that he was leaving, they were all very surprised. ”

“After going through the resignation procedures, the lawyer made a trip to the 58th floor. ”

“As soon as he got out of the elevator, he saw Zhao Xueyin walking over. ”

Zhao Xueyin also noticed the lawyer at the first moment. Her eyes were full of disgust.

Why did the lawyer come again?

Could it be that he came to find her to apologize? To Beg for her forgiveness?

She had already made things clear yesterday. Why did lawyer Si still have to do this?

It was so disgusting!

“Zhao Xueyin furrowed her brows tightly, “Lawyer Si, Can’t you leave some dignity for yourself? Do you have to be so persistent? I’ve already told you that I don’t like you. All along, it’s all your wishful thinking. Why Can’t you understand? ! What do you want?”Zhao Xueyin could almost imagine the lawyer’s next reaction. ”
