“Shi Qingcheng was not someone to be trifled with. She knew that Bai Mo had deliberately tripped her, so she stomped down on Bai Mo’s foot. ”

It hurt so much that Bai Mo’s expression changed.

“However, Shi Qingcheng pretended not to know anything, “I’m sorry, Bai Mo. I accidentally stepped on your foot. Does it hurt? I really didn’t do it on purpose. I didn’t expect that you don’t look very tall. Your legs are quite long. You can even stretch from that side to this side!” ”

The last sentence was very meaningful.

“Bai Mo was furious. She wanted to show Shi Qingcheng a lesson, but she did not expect to be tricked by Shi Qingcheng. ”

“”Miss Shi, I’m fine. You Don’t have to blame yourself.”Bai Mo stood up. “I’m going to the washroom.” ”

“Not long after Bai Mo left, Shi Qingcheng stood up as well. “I’m going to the washroom too.” ”

Shi Qingcheng was standing at the entrance of the washroom.

“The moment Bai Mo came out, she saw the slender Shi Qingcheng. ”

“”Miss Shi, you came to the washroom too?”Bai Mo took the initiative to greet her. ”

“Seeing Bai Mo come out, Shi Qingcheng stood up straight. “I’m here to look for you.” ”

“”Look for me?”Bai Mo frowned slightly. “Miss Shi, is there something you need me for?” ”

“Shi Qingcheng curled the corners of her lips. “Bai Mo, there’s no one else here besides us. You Don’t have to pretend anymore! Aren’t you tired?” ”

“”I don’t understand what you mean, Miss Shi,”Bai Mo said. ”

“Shi Qingcheng looked at Bai Mo with a smile, she said condescendingly, “Bai Mo, I’m very clear about your thoughts. To be honest, I’m quite disgusted with people like you. However, you’re still Jingshu’s cousin after all. That’s why I tried my best not to shed all pretense with you. “If you like Ye Han, feel free to make a move. If ye Han has the slightest bit of wavering in his heart, I, Shi Qingcheng, will immediately break up with him!” ”

“If ye Han could be seduced by Bai Mo so easily, then it was because Ye Han was not worthy of her! ”

“For Shi Qingcheng, it was not a bad thing for Bai Mo to suddenly appear out of nowhere. On the contrary, it was a good thing. ”

She also wanted to see how serious ye Han was about this relationship.

“Don’t you think you’re too confident in yourself?”Bai Mo looked at Shi Qingcheng.

Shi Qingcheng curled her lips. “Stop pretending?”

“Bai Mo did not answer directly. Instead, she said, “Miss Shi, I hope that you can remember what you said today. If you continue to bicker and cry, it won’t look good!” ”

“Shi Qingcheng looked at Bai Mo and said, “I, Shi Qingcheng, am a straightforward person. I will never do anything that goes back on my words!” ”

“After saying that, Shi Qingcheng turned around and left. ”

“Looking at Shi Qingcheng’s back, Bai Mo snorted coldly. ”

What was so great about Shi Qingcheng?

Just wait and see!

“Very soon, Shi Qingcheng would regret her decision today. ”

“After returning to the front hall, Bai Mo remained as polite as before to Shi Qingcheng. No one would have thought that the two of them had already shed all pretense of cordiality. ”

Lin Ze did not return to the hotel until evening.

“On the way, Lin Ze looked at BAI Jingshu and said, “Your grandfather is really nice.” ”

Bai Jingshu raised her eyebrows slightly. “He’s Just My Grandfather?”

“”He’s our grandfather,”Lin Ze corrected himself. ”

“Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “Where’s your grandfather? How is he?” ”

“Lin Ze narrowed his eyes. “My impression of my grandfather is very vague. In my impression, he should have a better temper than my grandmother...”elder Lin had left earlier, before Lin Ze could remember everything, he had already left. ”

“If elder Lin could make decisions in the Lin family, Lin Jincheng and ye Shu would not end up like that either. ”

Elder Lin was a person who respected the younger generation very much. He did not have any opinions about his family background.

“He had a free relationship with Old Lady Lin, and it was the kind of relationship where he had to be intimate with her. Therefore, elder Lin respected old lady Lin very much. ”

“”Your grandmother is also very nice,”Bai Jingshu continued. “She’s the grandmother I imagined.” ”

Lin Ze nodded. “My grandmother’s temper did improve a lot in the end.”

“Wasn’t she nice in the past?”Bai Jingshu asked.

Lin Ze continued to nod. “Not really.”

“Now that old Mrs. Lin had left, the deceased was the most important. Bai Jingshu couldn’t continue asking, she continued, “Actually, my grandmother’s temper isn’t that good either. My grandfather used to Dote on me very much, so she said, ‘what’s there to like about a little girl? If you like her, you’ll have to marry someone else in the end!'”! “But my grandfather doesn’t think that way. My grandfather is willing to dote on me!” ”

“Bai Jingshu’s grandmother was a very traditional grandmother. She always had the idea of throwing away the water that was thrown out by her daughter after she married off, so she did not treat her granddaughters very well. ”
