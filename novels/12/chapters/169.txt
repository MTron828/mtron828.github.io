Chapter 170: 087: Divorce! 6

Which man was not a romantic?

An Dongliang hugged Liang Xinyi tightly. “Xinyi, thank you for understanding me.”

Afraid that Xia Xiaoman would suspect him, an dongliang only stayed at Liang Xinyi’s place for about ten minutes before he went back.

An Lizi followed an Dongliang to Liang Xinyi’s place and called Ye Zhuo.

She was very worried now!

She was worried that if Xia Xiaoman did not divorce an Dongliang, Xia Xiaoman would be the one to be stripped of all her assets.

“Zao Zao! What should we do! My mom forgives my dad, my dad came to look for that Mistress Again!”An Lizi’s voice was close to tears.

Ye Zao’s voice came from the other end of the phone, “Lizi, don’t worry, listen to me...”

Ye Zao’s words were like magic, able to calm people down instantly.

After the call with Ye Zao, an Lizi had a plan in her mind. She went home to tidy up some things.

The next day, an Lizi went to Liang Xinyi’s office.

Qinghai company.

This was a foreign company. Liang Xinyi had worked in it for many years and could be considered half a small leader.

......

When her colleagues saw her, they would call her sister Liang.

“Hello, I’m looking for Liang Xinyi.”An Lizi came to the front desk.

The front desk lady said, “Young Lady, why are you looking for Sister Liang?”

An lizi smiled and said, “I’m a relative of her family. Can I trouble sister to call her out?”

The front desk lady saw that an Lizi was so good-looking and knew how to be polite, so she said, “Sister Liang is eating in the canteen. I’ll bring you there.”

“Okay, thank you.”

The cafeteria was very big, and there were more than 100 employees eating there.

An Lizi saw Liang Xinyi at a glance and strode to her side. Before Liang Xinyi could react, she gave Liang xinyi a hard slap!

Slap!

Liang Xinyi was stunned by the slap and didn’t recognize an Lizi. She frowned and said, “Who are you? What right do you have to hit people?”

“Mistress! Shameless! Destroying other people’s families!”An Lizi slapped Liang Xinyi again and said angrily, “I hit you! B * Tch! Who told you to seduce my father!”

As soon as she said this, those who were eating looked over with curiosity.

In this era, everything was lacking except for the masses.

“What nonsense are you spouting! I’m not a mistress! You’re slandering me!”Liang Xinyi immediately stood up and said with a flustered expression, “Where are the security guards! Call the security guards over quickly!”

The receptionist was stunned.

She originally thought that an Lizi was really Liang Xinyi’s relative, but she didn’t expect... Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

This melon came a little unexpectedly.

One had to know that Liang Xinyi was usually a very serious person. She would never say anything to those male employees because of personal matters.

In everyone’s eyes, she was just a kind big sister.

An Lizi took out a thick stack of photos that she had prepared beforehand from her bag. She tossed them all into the air and then took out the loudspeaker, “Everyone, Look! Liang Xinyi is Shameless! She seduced my father! She seduced a married woman and destroyed a happy family! How could your unit recruit such a shameless employee! “Now the evidence is clear. The person in the photo is my father, and Liang Xinyi is the third party!”

Because the loudspeaker was turned on, an Lizi’s voice filled every corner of the cafeteria.

At this moment, everyone gathered around to snatch the photo that had fallen to the ground.

Things happened too quickly. Liang Xinyi wanted to stop it, but it was too late. She could only shout helplessly, “Don’t pick it up! Don’t pick it up! Don’t do this!”

An Lizi was still shouting over and over again with the megaphone.

The crowd held the photo in their hands and pointed at Liang Xinyi.

Liang Xinyi felt as if she had been stripped naked.

She was an extremely shameless person. She didn’t expect to be humiliated like this in public today!

This was worse than killing her.

“F * ck! Can’t you see how serious she usually is? She’s actually this kind of person in private!”

“Bah! How Shameless!”

“The mistress will die a horrible death! She deserves to go to hell!”

These words were like knives, cutting Liang Xinyi’s body one by one. Liang Xinyi wished she could find a hole to hide in.

Not long after, the company leader came with the security guards. Everyone immediately made way for him.

“What’s Going On!”

The company leader was a very young man.

An Lizi was not afraid of him and took a step forward, “Hello, leader. My name is an Lizi. I would like to ask you, what is your company’s recruitment criteria? Is this kind of immoral person who seduces other people’s husbands and destroys other people’s families worthy of entering your company?”
