Chapter 151: 085: the Clever Lin Ze, the great burning of his debut! 3

Yun Jing, he will definitely go there again.

Taking out the crystal bracelet from the wooden box, a strong sense of guilt appeared in Old Lady Lin’s eyes.

Originally, she was still wondering if this child had gone to Yun Jing to look for ye Shu.

Unexpectedly, this child was only going to Yun Jing for a vacation.

Moreover, when he was playing, he did not forget this grandmother of his.

Sigh! Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

It was her fault.

She shouldn’t have doubted her own grandson so much.

Lin Ze put the crystal bead on Old Lady Lin’s wrist.

Dark purple crystal bead.

It was Old Lady Lin’s favorite color.

The smile on Old Lady Lin’s face deepened. “Thank you, Ah Ze. Grandma really likes the crystal bracelet you gave her. Ah Ze has grown up now and knows how to show filial respect to Grandma!”

Lin Ze smiled. “It’s good that you like it, Grandma. You raised me so hard since I was young. It’s only right for me to show respect to you!”

......

Hearing that.

Old Mrs. Lin’s eyes were filled with relief.

She knew it.

This grandson of hers was a filial and good child.

Seeing that old Mrs. Lin’s anger had completely dissipated, Lin ze continued, “Grandma, I’m sorry that I made you worry for so long. It’s getting late now. I’ll send you back to your room to rest.”

“Okay.”Old Mrs. Lin nodded.

The grandfather and grandson looked very harmonious, and the atmosphere was very harmonious.

Aunt Zhang looked at the backs of the grandfather and grandson and frowned deeply.

She had thought that the grandfather and grandson would have a big fight!

It would end with the grandfather and grandson falling out.

What was unexpected was that not only did the grandfather and grandson not fall out, but Old Mrs. Lin’s love for Lin Ze deepened.

Aunt Zhang returned to her room and gave Feng Qianhua a call.

She did not say much on the phone and only reminded Feng Qianhua that Lin Ze had already returned. Old Mrs. Lin did not fly into a rage.

She hung up the phone.

Feng Qianhua’s expression was frighteningly dark. “Are you playing a roundabout tactic with me?”

She had spent a lot of effort to sow discord between the grandfather and grandson. She did not expect that Lin Ze would use a photo and a bracelet to make old Mrs. Lin forget everything.

She would never believe it if she said that Lin Ze did not go to Yun Jing to look for ye Shu!

It seemed that she had underestimated Lin Ze.

However, so what if Lin Ze was smart?

He was just a teenager after all!

Feng Qianhua narrowed her eyes. She must become Lin Jincheng’s wife and give birth to a child that belonged to her and Lin Jincheng. She must drive Lin Ze out of the Lin family forever!

The Lin family.

Lin Ze had just arrived at his bedroom when the smile on his face disappeared. He picked up his phone and sent a message to ye Sen. [ Uncle Ye, I have arrived in Beijing safely. ]

[ home? ] Although it was already late at night, Ye Sen replied very quickly.

[ yes, Uncle Ye, if you have time to visit Beijing, you must tell me. I am the most familiar with the four or nine cities. ]

“Okay, my niece has been talking about applying to Beijing University recently. If she gets into Beijing University, I will tell you.”

Lin Ze looked at the words on the screen and smiled faintly.

Being Ye Sen’s niece must be very happy.

He wondered if his mother had any siblings.

If she did.

He should have an uncle too.

Then what does his uncle look like?

Will he be like Ye Sen?

Lin Ze fell into deep thought.

After a while, Lin ze replied, “I’ll wait for you in Beijing.”

“Well, it’s getting late. Go to bed early. Children can’t stay up late.”

“Good night, Uncle Ye.”

After replying to this message, Lin Ze went to the bathroom to take a shower.

...

In the blink of an eye, it was the 15th day of the first lunar month.

The arrival of the 15th day of the first lunar month meant that the new year had come to an end and that Yunjing city had resumed full-scale construction.

The students were going to start school.

The Ye family’s private kitchen was also going to open for business.

Ye Shu could not work because her hand was injured, so she recruited two more people. She just had to take turns in the shop.

However, although she could not work, she was not idle either. She was learning English every day. Even the music played during the lunch break in the shop was in English.

Hard work would be rewarded.

Although it was only a short ten days, ye Shu could now have simple meals and communicate with foreigners.

Ye Zhuo carried her schoolbag and went to school to report.

Before going to school, she went to the company on the way.

She rarely came to the company. When the employees saw her directly enter the president’s private elevator, they were all very curious.

“Who’s that? She’s So Pretty! The CEO’s Daughter?”

“I heard that our CEO is only 27 years old this year.”

“F * ck! Could she be the CEO’s girlfriend?”
