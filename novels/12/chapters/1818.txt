“Beloved Disciple?”Ye Zao was confused.

“”Have you forgotten?”CEN Shaoqing continued, “At that time, you hugged him and cried and cried, but you didn’t let go.” ”

“Ye Zao insisted that the Samoyed was her beloved disciple, the white dragon horse. He cried and cried. Helpless, CEN Shaoqing could only negotiate with the owner of the Samoyed and buy the Samoyed at twice the price. ”

“”Are you sure?”Ye zhuo frowned slightly, “How could I do such a thing! You must be lying!” ”

“”Woof!”The Samoyed immediately cried out, as if it was accusing ye Zhuo. ”

Ye Zhuo was inexplicably a little flustered.

Could it be that she was really such a sand sculpture after she got drunk?

Cen Shaoqing took out his phone and clicked to play the video.

“The next second, a video was played in the air. In the video, Ye Zhuo was hugging Samoya and did not let go. He cried bitterly, “White Dragon horse, don’t worry. I will never abandon you again! My White Dragon Horse!” ”

Ye Zhuo raised his hand to cover his eyes. He was a little embarrassed!

“If she had not seen it with her own eyes, she would never believe that this was her. ”

“Now do you believe that you vomited all over me?”Cen Shaoqing’s voice came from the air again.

The truth was right in front of her eyes. Ye Zhuo had no choice but to believe it. He raised his head and looked at Cen Shaoqing. “Why did you still record it? Quickly delete it! Isn’t it embarrassing?”

Cen Shaoqing smiled. “Now you know how embarrassing it is?”

Ye Zhuo did not say anything.

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “Do you know how the dog owner reacted back then?” ”

“Without a doubt, the dog owner must have been stunned. ” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Ye Zhuo glared at him. “I don’t want to know!”

“Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips parted slightly. “Alright, quickly get up! Grandma is still waiting for us to go back and eat.” ”

“Then what about it?”Ye Zhuo looked at the Samoyed on the ground.

The Samoyed also tilted its head and looked at Ye Zhuo.

“Ye Zhuo was too busy and did not have much time to raise small animals. Meanwhile, the Lin family had already raised a husky that was tearing down the house. With the addition of the Samoyed, under the guidance of the Husky, it would probably be able to turn the sky upside down! ”

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “Bring it back and let Grandma raise it. Coincidentally, a few days ago, Grandma said that she wanted to raise a puppy.” ”

“”Alright then,”ye Zhuo continued, “If Grandma doesn’t raise it, bring it back to my house.” ”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing turned around and left.

“After taking a few steps, he turned back and brought the Samoyed back with him. ”

“Ye Zhuo sat on the bed and woke up for a few seconds. Then, he lifted the blanket and got up, preparing to change his clothes. ”

The clothes were prepared by Cen Shaoqing in advance.

It was a set of beige and fragrant clothes.

“Ye Zao was a walking clothes rack and could control any clothes. After changing his clothes, he stood in front of the floor-to-ceiling mirror and whistled coolly, “Why do I Look So Good!” ”

“Half an hour later, the two of them appeared at the entrance of the Cen Manor while holding Samoyed’s hand. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen was standing at the door early. When she saw ye Zao, she ran over excitedly, “Yezi!” ”

“Grandma Cen!”The old man and young man hugged each other for a long time before letting go.

“Cen Shaoqing led the Samoyed over. “Grandma, didn’t you say that you wanted to get a dog? This Samoyed is for you to keep.” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen snorted and continued, “Where did the dog come from? Why does it look as ugly as you!” ”

“CEN Shaoqing said, “This dog was bought by Zhuo Zhuo, but she didn’t have time to keep it. Since you don’t want to keep it, then forget it!” ”

“Hearing this, Old Mrs. Cen’s expression instantly changed. She immediately took the dog leash from Cen Shaoqing’s hand and stroked the dog’s head, she said, “I was wondering why this little guy is so cute and so handsome! So it was bought by burning! Good great great grandson, quickly let great grandma take a look!” ”

Cen Shaoqing:”...”
