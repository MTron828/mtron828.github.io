“Chapter 1654: 347: light speed slaps face, Tang Xue goes to jail! 3”

“After all, he had done something wrong, and the minister always felt very uneasy. ”

“Dr. Cara leaned against the back of his chair, lit a cigar, and blew out a puff of smoke. The corners of his mouth curled into a sarcastic smile. “Found out? By Who?” ”

“As long as the notary office stood on his side and did not leak the evidence from that year, no matter how hard ye Zhuo tried, it would be useless. ”

“The notary office was mostly C Nation’s people. If their own people did not help their own people, would they help ye Zao? ”

“The minister said nervously, “Will there really be nothing wrong?” ”

“”Minister Anthony, don’t worry.”Dr. Cara stood up from his chair, “I assure you that nothing will happen! I have already gotten someone to clean up the video from that year. Everything is based on evidence. If YC doesn’t have any evidence, what can they do to us?” ”

“There was only one copy of the video evidence from back then, and it was all kept by the international department. ”

“Currently, the International Department had already destroyed everything. Another two years had passed. Could Ye Zao still find anything? ”

“Hearing this, Anthony relaxed a little. ”

“The evidence from the international department had all been destroyed. Currently, only YC and Dr. Cara had a gambling agreement. However, the agreement in Cara’s hands was different from ye Zao’s agreement. Both sides had their own opinions, without the proof of a third party, even if they went to the International Court, the agreement would still be invalidated. ”

“Dr. Cara was relying on this, which was why he dared to be so unscrupulous. ”

“At this moment, Dr. Cara’s cell phone suddenly rang. ”

Dr. Cara took out his cell phone and took a look. The caller ID showed that it was ye Zao.

Ye Zao?

Why would ye Zao call him at this time?

He must be at his wit’s end!

“Otherwise, he wouldn’t have taken the initiative to call him. ”

PA —

Dr. Cara threw his phone on the table. “Look who called.”

Anthony looked down. “YC?”

“Yes.”The sarcastic smile on Dr. Cara’s face was very obvious. “Do you think she would have called me if she had a solution?”

“Without thinking, it was obvious that ye Zao must have called to reason with him. ”

Ye Zao was also an idiot!

Because anyone with a brain would not call him at such a time.

He and ye Zao were on opposing sides. Could it be that ye Zao still expected him to be honest on the international internet? was all of this self-directed and self-staged by him and the notary office?

How could that be possible!

Anthony smiled and picked up the goblet on the table. “Let’s have a toast.”

Dr. Cara also picked up the goblet. “Cheers.”

“He put down the goblet. Anthony said again, “Do you think YC will look for the chairman of the Board?” ”

The chairman of the board was Anthony’s immediate superior.

“Everyone knew about the bet agreement at that time. Although the notary office did not come out to notarize it, it would not be of any benefit to him if this matter was brought up to the higher-ups. ”

“Hearing this, Dr. Cara laughed out loud, “Do you think the president would be so free to care about a Chinese person with no background?” ”

“The president was also a C citizen, so his people would definitely help his people. Would the president be on Ye Zhuo’s side? ”

It was impossible!

Unless the president was crazy.

Anthony nodded and felt that what Cara said made sense.

“Other than building a lightspeed aircraft carrier, YC indeed did not have any background in C country. and the President of the International Department was from C country. It was easy to guess which side the president would be on! ”

“After saying that, Dr. Cara continued, “We have saved the base. Maybe the President will reward you for that!” ”

“Anthony smiled and said, “If that’s really the case, then I must thank you, Dr. Cara!” ”

On the other side.

“Cara did not pick up the phone, so ye Zao did not continue to call. Instead, he put down the phone, picked up the microphone on the table, plugged in the magnetic card on the landline, and made a call. ”

“Soon, the call was connected. ”

“Get Me Maxine.”

“Hearing ye Zao’s voice, the person on the other side of the phone was stunned at first, then looked at the caller ID and immediately said, “Yes! Please wait a moment.” ”

“Soon, a deep and respectful voice came from the other end, “Hello, this is Maxine!” ”

“Ten minutes later, in C Nation. ”

“Minister! It’s a call for you!”The assistant hurriedly ran in from outside the door.

“Who is it?”Anthony asked. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“The assistant lowered his voice and said, “It’s Mr. President Calling!” ”

President?

“Anthony immediately put down the goblet and took the cell phone from the assistant with both hands. “Hello, chairman! This is Anthony!” ”
