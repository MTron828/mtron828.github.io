“Chapter 1307: 273: directly slapping her in the face, making Zheng Wanyin doubt her life! 6”

Translator: 549690339

Zheng Wanyin frowned.

The taste was a little pungent.

Could Ye Zhuo really eat these things?

“It smells so good!”Cen Yueya took a deep breath.

“Everyone sat down around the table. Old Mrs. Cen picked up her chopsticks. “Those who can sit at the table today are not outsiders. Don’t be shy, let’s eat.” ”

“Cen Yueya could not wait to pick up a piece of Mandarin fish meat. “It’s so delicious! The taste is too authentic! Zhuozhuo, have a taste.” ”

“As she finished speaking, Cen Yueya quickly picked up her chopsticks and picked up a piece of Mandarin fish meat for ye Zhuo. ”

Ye Zhuo took a bite.

“The meat was fresh and tender. It was refreshing and chewy. There was a hint of smelly in the fragrance. The texture was first-class. After one bite, one would want to take a second bite. ”

“Cen Yueya looked at Ye Zao. “Zao Zao, how does it taste?” ”

“”It’s very delicious,”ye Zao said. ”

“Cen Yueya smiled and said, “It’s not like a family doesn’t come into the same house. I knew you would definitely like this one too.” ”

Ye Zao picked up a chopstick and gave it to Cen Shaoqing. “You want to try it too?”

“Seeing this scene, Zheng Wanyin’s eyes were filled with shock. ”

Making Cen Shaoqing eat smelly mandarin fish?

Who Didn’t know that Cen Shaoqing had always been a vegetarian!

“Ye Zhuo wanted to show that he was different in front of Cen Shaoqing, but he didn’t act like this either. ”

Wasn’t this a little arrogant because he was spoiled?

It seemed that ye Zhuo still didn’t know Cen Shaoqing well enough.

Who Was Cen Shaoqing?

Cen Wuye was a man of his word. How could he change anything because of a little girl.

Zheng Wanyin originally thought that ye Zhuo would accompany Cen Shaoqing for a period of time.

She never thought that ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing would end up on a piece of smelly mandarin fish meat.

It shouldn’t be. It shouldn’t be. Ye Zhuo shouldn’t have challenged Cen Shaoqing’s bottom line.

Zheng Wanyin sighed softly.

“But in the next second, Zheng Wanyin’s pupils suddenly widened. ”

“She, what did she see? ”

“She saw Cen Shaoqing actually pick up the fish meat in the bowl, and then... ”

She ate it.

She ate it!

Cen Shaoqing actually ate it.

“Cen Yueya smiled and asked, “How is it, fifth girl? is the fish that searing gave you delicious?” ”

“It’s very delicious.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“CEN Yueya continued, “I see that you will be a strict wife from now on.” ”

“As Cen Shaoqing’s sister, Cen Yueya understood Cen Shaoqing too well. ”

Cen Shaoqing had a lot of faults and was very difficult to please.

It was fine if ye Zhuo was around.

“If ye Zhuo wasn’t around, she wouldn’t eat either here or there. ”

“Every time they ate, old Mrs. Cen would ask the kitchen to make a serving for CEN Shaoqing. ”

To Eat Smelly Mandarin fish?

How could that be!

“Aunt had sent smelly mandarin fish to the Cen family for decades, but she had never seen Cen Shaoqing eat it. ”

Cen Shaoqing did not refute her. He placed the Buddha beads on the table with his left hand and looked like he was proud of his wife.

Strict Wife?

Who?

Cen Shaoqing?

Zheng Wanyin felt that her worldview had collapsed.

How could a person like Cen Shaoqing be strict wife!

How could this be?

This was not quite what she had imagined.

“Cen Shaoqing picked up a prawn and slowly peeled it. Just when Zheng Wanyin felt that Cen Shaoqing was going to eat it, Cen Shaoqing put the prawn into ye Zhuo’s bowl. ”

“After peeling the prawn, Cen Shaoqing picked up a crab leg... ”

“Soon, ye Zao’s bowl was filled with meat. ”

“There were obviously servants around, but Cen Shaoqing had to do it himself. ”

“For a moment, Zheng Wanyin felt like she was chewing on wax. ”

Xie wanqiu also couldn’t stand it.

“She was Cen Shaoqing’s grandmother. Cen Shaoqing should have been filial to her, but Cen Shaoqing had never peeled prawns for her. ”

“Even as a grandmother, she had never enjoyed such treatment. ”

Ye Zao?

Who the hell was ye Zao?

Someone like ye Zao still wanted to marry into the Cen Family?

Don’t even think about it!

“Let’s not talk about anything else. First of all, she would not be able to pass this test. ”

She would never let such a disrespectful girl marry Cen Shaoqing!

“Xie wanqiu put down her chopsticks and looked at Ye Zao. She put on a smile and said kindly, “Zao Zao, have you graduated from university?” ”

“Ye Zao didn’t like to talk while chewing. He slowly swallowed the food in his mouth and said, “Not yet.” ”

“How many years until graduation?”Xie wanqiu continued to ask.

“”Two years,”ye Zao answered. ”

“Two years? That’s soon.”Xie wanqiu drank a mouthful of soup. “Have you thought about where you will go to work after graduation?”

Ye Zao shook his head slightly.

“”I have to think about it quickly.”Xie wanqiu continued, “Zao Zao, do you know the International Organization Alliance Aba?” ”

“I’ve heard of it.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

He didn’t know if he really knew or if he was pretending to know because he wanted to maintain his reputation.
