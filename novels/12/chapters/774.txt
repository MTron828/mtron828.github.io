Liu Caiyi snorted coldly. “I’m getting old. It’s inevitable that I’m a little old and muddle-headed.”

Some people could turn a blind eye to master Yu’s protection.

But she could not.

She was the Messenger of justice!

1

She could not stand anything unfair in this world.

She would definitely make ye Zhuo stand higher and fall more miserably!

“Liu Caiyi held mother Liu’s hand, she smiled and said, “Mom, don’t worry. When I become the President of the Chinese Arts Association, I Won’t be far away from becoming an elder. At that time, I will definitely join hands with the president and chief of the calligraphy and chess world, as well as the president and chief of the literary world, to let them clean up the internal atmosphere! Clean Up the house!” ”

Liu Caiyi was determined to become the president.

Her life would not stop at the president.

“In the future, she would be an elder, the chief elder, and the chief president! ”

What About Ye Zao?

Ye Zao would end up being chased out of the literary world.

Thinking of that scene.

“The corners of Liu Caiyi’s lips curled up, and her heart was filled with joy. ”

“Mother Liu narrowed her eyes. “So, you are confident that you will be able to run for the position of President?” ”

“Liu Caiyi nodded, “Over the years, there hasn’t been any new blood injected into the Chinese art world. Even if there are newcomers, they are still inferior to me! “Now, not only is second elder very satisfied with me, president Zheng is also very satisfied with me. President Zheng has already told me to take over his position.” ”

President Zheng was the current president of the Association. No one’s approval was more important than president Zheng’s approval.

Liu Caiyi was not a blindly confident person.

“”That’s good.”Hearing these words, mother Liu heaved a sigh of relief. ”

Their Liu family was not some Orthodox scholarly family. It was not easy for Liu Caiyi to enter the world of traditional Chinese painting and achieve her current achievements. Mother Liu hoped that Liu Caiyi could walk further and further down this path.

...

Lin family.

“Ever since Feng Xianxian lost the competition, she had been depressed, which made Old Lady Lin very unhappy. ”

She felt that this was all ye Zhuo’s fault.

If it was not for ye Zhuo...

Feng Xianxian would not have become like this.

“Ye Zhuo got full marks, while Feng Xianxian only got 60 marks. No one would feel good about this. ”

“If ye Zhuo had relied on his strength, it would have been fine. ”

“However, Old Lady Lin felt that there was something fishy going on. ”

Ye Zhuo was only 20 years old.

How could she be that good?

She was a doctor YC in the science and technology field. How could she get full marks in the literary world?

It was definitely master Yu who helped her cheat.

She had to be the one to solve the problem.

“If she wanted to open Feng Xianxian’s heart, she had to rely on ye Zhuo. ”

Old Lady Lin went straight to Beijing University.

Ye Zhuo was drying his hair in the dormitory. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“At this moment, Li Yueyue pushed the door open and came in. “Da Zao Zao, your grandmother is here.” ”

“My Grandmother?”Ye Zao was stunned.

Old Lady Lin?

“Yes.”Li Yueyue nodded. “She’s downstairs right now. Hurry down and take a look.”

Ye Zao put down the hairdryer and walked downstairs.

“As expected, Old Lady Lin was waiting for her downstairs. ”

“Zao Zao.”

“Seeing ye Zao, Old Lady Lin came up to him with a smile. “This is the dessert I just bought. Try It.” ”

There must be something fishy going on.

Old Lady Lin must have something up her sleeve to look for her.

“Although ye Zao loved dessert as much as his life, he did not take the dessert from Old Lady Lin. “Grandma, if there’s anything, just tell me directly. There’s no need to be so pretentious.” ”

The smile on Old Lady Lin’s face stiffened a little.

Ye Zao would always be like this.

“In front of an elder like her, he did not look like a junior at all. ”

Other People’s granddaughters were so filial to their own grandma.

What About Ye Zao?

Ye Zao probably wished that she would die as soon as possible.

“Old Lady Lin continued, “Zao Zao, I did come to look for you because of something.” ”

“”Please speak,”ye Zao’s tone was indifferent. ”

“Old Lady Lin said, “Zhuozhuo, ever since you defeated Xianxian in the assessment, Xianxian has been in a bad mood for the past few days. I hope that you can go over and Enlighten Xianxian and apologize to her at the same time.” ”

“Apologize?”Ye Zhuozhuo’s eyes remained the same. “Why should I apologize to her?”

“Old Lady Lin Glanced at Ye Zhuozhuo. “Others may not know what method you used to win the assessment, but I know very well in my heart.” ”

“Ye Zao’s expression turned cold. “Then, please tell me, what method did I use to win the assessment? I respect you as an elder, so I call you grandma. I also hope that you can face yourself properly and not push your luck!” ”

Old Lady Lin’s expression was also very ugly. “You mean you don’t want to apologize to Xianxian?”

“After saying that, old lady lin continued, “Do you still have a grandmother in your heart? If you don’t apologize to Xianxian, I won’t have a granddaughter like you from now on!” ”
