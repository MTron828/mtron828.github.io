Translator: 549690339

Cen Shaoqing and old Mrs. Cen naturally sat at the main seats.

Feng Qianhua and Feng Xianxian were also arranged by Old Mrs. Lin to sit at the main seats.

“Looking at Cen Shaoqing sitting above her, Feng Xianxian tried her best to control her heartbeat. ”

10 o’clock Sharp.

The music at the banquet was stopped.

Everyone looked at the stage in the middle of the banquet hall.

“Lin Jincheng appeared on the stage. “Hello, everyone. Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to attend our Lin family’s family recognition banquet. I am deeply honored!” ”

Thunderous applause sounded from below the stage.

“”Next, I would like to introduce my wife, Ye Shu, and my daughter, Ye Zao...” ”

“Hearing this, everyone perked up. ”

“A vulgar village woman from the countryside, an idiot who didn’t know how to read. ”

“In such a grand occasion, these two people who came from a small place would definitely be embarrassed. ”

They were really looking forward to this scene!

Ye Zao?

“Hearing this name, Feng Xianxian frowned. ”

Could it be that they had the same name?

How could an idiot be admitted to Beijing University?

They must have the same name!

“Oh my God!”

“Holy shit! This is too beautiful!”

“At this moment, a gasp of cold air suddenly sounded from the crowd. ”

Feng Xianxian raised her head and saw two figures slowly walking towards the stage.

“One of them had a gentle temperament and a smile on her face. Her beautiful face did not have the vulgar aura that everyone had imagined. Instead, it was filled with nobility and elegance. She did not lose out to any of the wealthy ladies present. ”

“She had a slender figure. Her beautiful facial features were as exquisite as exquisiteness. There was not much expression on her breathtakingly perfect face. However, for no reason, she had a feeling that she could not catch up to her. ”

This was the true beauty of the country.

“Even if one searched the entire capital, they would not be able to find such a person. ”

This?

This was ye Zao?

Ye Zao!

Feng Qianqian felt that her entire person was in a bad state. Her back was covered with layers of cold sweat. Never in her dreams did she expect that ye Zao was actually Lin Jincheng’s daughter.

How could it be ye Zao!

How could it be ye Zao!

Then what was she?

“After all, in the dormitory, she had always considered herself as the Lin family’s eldest miss... ”

“In school, Ye Zao had snatched away her title as the school Belle. ”

“Unexpectedly, when she returned to the Lin family, she was robbed of her title as the eldest miss of the Lin family by Ye Zao. ”

Was Ye Zao that fond of stealing her things?

Feng Xianxian took a deep breath.

No Way!

She couldn’t let ye Zao steal her things just like that.

So what if ye Zao was beautiful? She came from a small place and didn’t know anything. She still had a way to embarrass her in public! Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“At that time, Old Lady Lin would definitely kick ye Zao out! ”

“After all, Old Lady Lin cared about face the most. ”

“At that time, she would still be the only young miss of the Lin family. ”

Feng Xianxian’s hands were clenched into fists.

Wait!

Ye Zao was about to make a fool of himself.

The appearance of Ye Shu and ye Zao shocked everyone in the banquet hall.

“They thought that they would see two people who were full of ugliness. They didn’t expect that not only did they not make a fool of themselves, they even won the gasps of the audience. ”

This was a little different from what they had imagined of a country bumpkin.

“”Don’t say that, this Lin family’s eldest miss really looks like the Lin family’s eldest miss!” ”

“She’s the authentic Lin family’s eldest miss. is she something that those unorthodox people can compare to?”

“Hearing this, Feng Xianxian’s face was a little embarrassed. ”

Unorthodox?

She was not some unorthodox person!

The real unorthodox person should be ye Zhuo!

“With this in mind, Feng Xianxian stood up from her seat and smiled at the stands. “Congratulations to Uncle Lin for finding my sister. In order to welcome my sister home, I specially prepared a small gift. Please accept it, Sister.” ”

“As soon as she finished speaking, someone carried a piano up. ”

“Seeing that Feng Xianxian was giving a piano.., during the banquet, someone immediately said, “I heard that young master Lin is extremely talented in music. At such a young age, he is already at the professional level. I believe that Miss Lin’s musical talent is definitely not inferior to young master Lin’s. I wonder if we will be lucky enough to hear Miss Lin play a piece today to broaden our horizons? We can also try out the tone of this piano.” ”

A piano was not an instrument that an ordinary family could play.

“After all, an ordinary piano cost tens of thousands of dollars. ”

Not to mention the tuition fees.

Ye Zao had just been brought back by the Lin family. She knew how to play the piano?

“She probably couldn’t even knock a bowl as well as Feng Xianxian, right? ”

“To put it bluntly, ye Zao was just the surface light of a donkey dung egg. ”

He didn’t know anything!

“When he said this, everyone turned to look at Ye Zao on the stage. ”

“Ye Zao’s expression was indifferent. His exquisite brows were coated with a layer of light by the Crystal Light. “My musical talent is average, so I won’t make a fool of myself.” ”

“”Miss Lin, you don’t know how to do it, right?” ”

It was unknown who said this at the banquet.

Old Lady Lin’s expression turned cold.

What a disgrace! He didn’t even know how to play a simple instrument like the piano!
