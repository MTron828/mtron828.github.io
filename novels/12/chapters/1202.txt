“It won’t happen again. Don’t worry.”Si lui didn’t have any expression on his face. “I’ve left the Shunxi Consortium.”

“Left?”Jiang Xiaoyu widened his eyes in disbelief. “Are you sure you’ve left the Shunxi Consortium?”

“En.”Si lui nodded.

“Jiang Xiaoyu asked curiously, “How did you see Zhao Xueyin clearly?” ”

Si lui smiled but didn’t say anything.

“Jiang Xiaoyu continued, “Then what do you plan to do now?” ”

“”Go home,”Si lui said. ”

“Go Home?”Jiang Xiaoyu was stunned.

Wasn’t Si Lui an orphan?

Which home did he want to go back to?

“However, Jiang Xiaoyu didn’t ask further. He nodded and said, “Oh, I wish you a better future and a bright future.” ”

“Thank you.”

“You’re welcome.”

“After saying a few more words to Jiang Xiaoyu, the lawyer turned around and left. ”

The car sped along.

“Soon, they arrived at the Jin family’s old residence. ”

The lawyer got off the car.

“Under the sun, he just looked at the Jin family’s old residence. There was no expression in his eyes. ”

It had been five years.

He was back.

In the future.

“In this world, there was only Jin Ruyu and no lawyer. ”

“Uncle Fu took the watering can and was about to water the flowers in the garden. When he came out, he saw the lawyer standing at the door. ”

“”Young, Young Master!” ”

“At this moment, uncle Fu thought that he was hallucinating and wiped his eyes with his sleeve. ”

Nothing had changed.

The scene in front of him hadn’t changed.

It wasn’t an illusion!

“Uncle Fu was so excited that he didn’t even want the watering can. He turned around and ran into the house. “Old Master, Old Master!” ”

“Hearing Uncle Fu’s voice, Old Master Jin put down the pipe in his hand. “What’s Wrong?” ”

“Uncle Fu was out of breath. “Young, young master, Young Master is back!” ”

PA —

The pipe in Old Master Jin’s hand fell to the ground and he grabbed uncle Fu’s hand. “Really? Ruyu is really back?”

“She’s Back! She’s Back!”Uncle Fu nodded hurriedly. “Young master is really back!”

“Quick! Come out with me and take a look!”

Uncle Fu followed Old Master Jin’s footsteps.

“When he reached the door, he saw Si lui standing outside. ”

“At that moment, Old Master Jin’s eyes turned red. ”

His throat was also hard.

He was back.

His son was finally back.

“After a long while, old master Jin slowly calmed down and walked to Si Lui’s side. “You’re back. Why aren’t you in the House?” ”

It was a very familiar voice. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

It was not as cold and sarcastic as he had imagined.

Si Lu lowered his head and saw Old Master Jin with a head full of gorgeous hair.

It had been five years since they last met.

Old Master Jin had aged quite a bit.

“Dad.”

Si Lu said with a raspy voice.

“After experiencing so many things,. ”

Si Lu understood a lot.

Ye Zhuo was right.

“However, doing good deeds meant Mo Wen’s future. ”

“He had such a deep misunderstanding of Ye Zhuo, but ye Zhuo could still understand him. ”

The person in front of him was his father.

The father who had raised him since he was young.

He shouldn’t have been angry with Old Master Jin.

What happened back then wasn’t all Old Master Jin’s fault.

“When he heard this ‘father’, Old Master Jin’s emotions immediately collapsed. He hugged Si lui and cried out bitterly. ”

“”Child, good child, father has let you down! What happened back then was all father’s fault...” ”

Si Lui was stunned.

“In his impression, Father Zhao had always been an old-fashioned man who cared a lot about face and had a strong chauvinism. In front of the younger generation, he would never lower his head and admit his mistake. ”

Even if he was indeed wrong in this matter.

He would never admit his mistake.

“But this time, Old Master Jin was actually like this in front of him. Thinking of what he had done all these years, Si lui felt very uncomfortable. “Dad, you’re not wrong, I’m the one who’s wrong...” ”

“Seeing that the father and son had finally broken the estrangement, Uncle Fu was so excited that he wiped his tears. ”

That was great!

That was really great.

“After a while, uncle fu continued, “Master, young master, it’s not a place to talk outside. Let’s quickly enter the house.” ”

Old Master Jin wiped his tears and put his arm around Si Lui’s shoulder. “Yes! Let’s enter the house! Let’s enter the House First!”

Si lui followed Old Master Jin into the house.

“Old Master Jin continued, “Ruyu, you haven’t eaten yet, right? I’ll ask the kitchen to make something for you!” ”

“”I’ve already eaten,”si lui said. ”

“It’s good that you’ve eaten.”Old Master Jin looked at Si lui but didn’t see his suitcase.

Could it be that this child wasn’t planning to stay at his parents’place?

“Uncle Fu saw the sadness in Old Master Jin’s eyes and continued, “Young master, you’re not leaving this time, right?” ”

“Yes.”Si lui nodded. “I’m not leaving.”

“Hearing Si lui say that he wasn’t leaving, old master Jin heaved a sigh of relief. ”
