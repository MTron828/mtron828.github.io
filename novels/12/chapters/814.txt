“Chapter 815: 178: Shunxi Financial Group, the mystery of half a month’s disappearance 6”

Translator: 549690339

A child who did not know that she had been kidnapped since she was young would naturally not embark on the path of family search.

“Therefore, Xi Muwen had never thought that one day, ye Langhua would find half a month. ”

He was even less worried that half a month would find ye Langhua.

“”Don’t worry, she won’t be able to find her way back.” ”

Yang Jiao glanced at Xi Muwen. “Are you that sure? What if that Little Bastard is found? What will we do then?”

“Xi Weiyue was a little speechless. “Mother, don’t you think about what kind of place Yunjing is? There are unruly people out there. Little Half Moon isn’t even the biological child of that family, so why would they treat her well? “Maybe she’s already been raised to death. Even if she’s still alive now, she’s probably just a yellow-faced old woman who doesn’t know anything! “She’s already married and has children! “She’s uncultured and ignorant. Do you think she has the ability to bring her back?” ”

“Back then, half a month was only a few years old and she didn’t remember anything at all. ”

“Furthermore, to prevent any accidents from happening, Xi Muwen had even left half a month outside to freeze for an entire night, causing her to have a high fever. ”

“Even if this high fever didn’t take half a month’s life, her intelligence would definitely suffer as well. Perhaps half a month would have turned into a fool long ago. ”

“Upon hearing this, Yang Jiao heaved a sigh of relief. ”

“Xi Weiyue then looked at XI Muwen and continued, “Father, I saw a very strange person at Aunt’s place today.” ”

“How Strange?”Xi Muwen asked.

“XI weiyue then continued, “I can guarantee that he’s definitely someone from a big family, but he looks very unfamiliar. He’s never been on the financial report or the news.” ”

“What does he look like?”

“Xi Weiyue’s mind went back to her memories. “He’s very tall. He’s wearing a long gown from the Republic of China era. He even has a string of Buddhist beads in his hand. His aura is very strong... Dad, do you think he’s from the Shunxi Financial Group?” ”

Xi Muwen narrowed his eyes. “Is the person you’re talking about vegetarian?”

“If he was vegetarian, he would definitely be from the CEN family. ”

Xi Weiyue shook her head. “I don’t think he’s a vegetarian because the main dish aunt prepared for them was old duck and vermicelli soup.”

“”Then, it shouldn’t be him.” ”

“XI weiyue immediately asked, “Who do you suspect?” ”

“”CEN fifth master,”Xi Muwen answered. ”

CEN fifth master?

“When she heard this, Xi Weiyue’s eyes lit up. Never in her wildest dreams would she have thought that the man she met in half a month was the famous CEN fifth master. ”

“Then, XI Muwen continued, “However, Fifth Master Cen has been a vegetarian for many years. The person you met shouldn’t be him.” ”

“Disappointment flashed across Xi Weiyue’s eyes when she heard this. “But if it’s not fifth master Cen, then who is he?” ”

“Xi Muwen shook his head and continued, “In a few days, it will be little half of the month’s birthday. During this period of time, you should visit your aunt more often and pay attention to her situation at the same time.” ”

“Even though Little Half Moon had gone missing for many years, Aunt Lang still remembered her every birthday and would prepare gifts for her every year. ”

“In order to make Xi Weiyue more like Little Half Moon, when Xi Weiyue was only nine months old, Xi Muwen had arranged for the doctor to give Yang Jiao an early c-section. ”

“Therefore, Xi Weiyue’s birthday and Little Half Moon’s birthday were on the same day. ”

Xi Weiyue nodded. “I know.”

On the other side.

It was already an hour later after ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing finished their meal.

The two of them bid farewell to Aunt Lang and set off for the cinema.

The car was moving very fast.

“Ye Zhuo sat in the passenger seat and took a nap. Just then, the phone rang in the car. ”

“”Leader, please help me answer the call.” ”

Ye Zhuo picked up the phone on the central console. “Hello.”

“The sudden female voice stunned the other side for a few seconds. After verifying that he had not dialed the wrong number, a cautious voice came from the other end of the phone. “Hello, May I know if Master Five is there?” ”

“One moment.”Ye Zhuo leaned over and passed the phone to Cen Shaoqing’s ear. “He should be looking for you for something.”

“What is it? Speak.”Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips parted.

“A cautious voice came from the other end, afraid that he would accidentally offend this master. “Master five, there’s a problem in the laboratory. Do you have time to come over and take a look now?” ”

Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips parted slightly. “Think of a way to solve it.”

Nothing was more important than watching a movie with his wife!

“After hanging up the phone, ye Zhuo looked at Cen Shaoqing. “Let’s go to the laboratory. We can watch the movie when we have time.” ”

“Don’t worry.”Cen Shaoqing’s tone was low. It was obvious that he did not take this matter to heart. “They will think of a way to solve it.”

“Go to the laboratory.”

“These four words were very light, but they scared Cen Shaoqing so much that he shivered. He immediately turned at the next intersection and said, “I’ll go now.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing held the steering wheel with one hand and the Buddha beads with the other. He tilted his head and looked at Ye Zhuo. Seeing that she still looked the same, Cen Shaoqing was a little nervous. ”

“She shouldn’t be angry, right? ”

In the laboratory.

“After Cen Jiang hung up the phone, Cen Hai immediately came over and asked, “When will master five arrive?” ”

Cen Jiang still couldn’t react at this moment. “The person who answered the phone just now was a girl...”

“”A girl? !”Cen Hai was stunned. “Really? Dajiang, did you hear wrongly?” ”

When had a girl appeared beside Cen Shaoqing?

She even answered CEN Shaoqing’s phone call.

“Cen Jiang gulped. “I’m sure I didn’t hear wrongly. That Girl’s voice was pretty nice, so she gave the phone to master five.” ”

“Cen Hai continued, “Then what did Master Five Say? When will he arrive?” ”

“”Master five asked us to think of a way to solve it ourselves.”Cen Jiang continued, “I have a feeling that master five will not come to the lab. He seems to have gone on a date with that girl.” ”

Date?

How could that be possible!

“Everyone in Beijing knew that Fifth Master Cen was an unmarried man. He was already in his thirties, and even his first love, first kiss, was still there. ”

How could he date a girl?

“At this moment, a young woman with long hair and a good temperament walked over. “Date? who went on a date?” ”

“”Fifth master,”Cen Jiang replied. ”

“The long-haired woman smiled and said, “You must have heard wrongly.” ”

“Cen Jiang said, “Sister Xue, it’s true! The person who received Master Five’s call just now was a girl! “Furthermore, master five has always placed great importance on the laboratory. When he heard that there was a problem in the laboratory, how could he let us think of a way on our own? “He’s clearly in a hurry to go on a date with someone else! “Our experimental base will soon have a female owner!” ”

“Tang Xue looked at Cen Jiang. “I don’t think you’re awake yet, right?” ”

Ding Fu

“At this moment, the door of the experimental base was opened. ”

“Who’s Here?”Tang Xue pressed the communicator on her chest.

“It’s master five.”

Tang Xue released the communicator and turned to look at Cen Jiang with a smile in her eyes. “Didn’t you say that master five went on a date?”
