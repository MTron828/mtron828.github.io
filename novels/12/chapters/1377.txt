“By the time Zhou Zuolong found him, he was already a wealthy merchant. ”

As for Zhou Xiang.

“Zhou Xiang had always been a well-behaved girl and listened to Zhou Zuolong’s words. If she had not met Cen Haifeng by accident, Zhou Xiang would have been married to an old man who was more than thirty years older than her. ”

“Fortunately, Cen Haifeng had his own opinions and knew Zhou Xiang’s personality. Therefore, after he fell in love with Zhou Xiang, he had always protected Zhou Xiang. That was why Zhou Zuolong and Xie Wanqiu did not succeed. ”

“”Sister, things are not as simple as you think! If moving forward could solve the problem, I would not have investigated for so many years!” ”

“Zhou jinbei continued, “Do you still remember the abnormality before our mother passed away? During that time, mother was depressed, while father often left early and returned late! Have you ever thought of the reason?” ”

How could Zhou Xiang not have thought of this?

She even confronted Zhou Zuolong.

“Zhou Xiang took a sip of coffee and explained, “During that period of time, DAD was investigating Mom’s matter, while Mom was worried that dad would find out.” ”

One was busy investigating leaving early and returning late.

“The other was worried that Zhou Zuolong would find out something, so she was depressed. ”

“It seemed to be a very reasonable explanation, so when Zhou Zuolong told Zhou Xiang about this matter, Zhou Xiang did not doubt Zhou Zuolong’s words at all. ”

“”SIS, do you really believe that this is the case?”Zhou Zuolong asked. ”

“Then what do you think is the case?”Zhou Xiang asked back.

“Zhou zuolong continued, “The result of my investigation was that Xie Wanqiu interfered in their marriage. When mom found dad to question her, dad told mom that she could get a divorce. “At that time, I was eight years old, and you were thirteen years old. In order to be with Zhou Zuolong, mom even fell out with Grandpa’s people. In the face of Zhou Zuolong’s betrayal, what do you think Mom Could Do?” ”

“Wu Lan was a serious young lady. For the sake of her lover, she had betrayed almost everyone. ”

She did not expose her family’s dirty laundry.

Her dignity did not allow her to reveal this matter to the public.

“Hence, she could only swallow her anger. ”

“Until one day, when she could not bear it anymore, she stayed in that world forever. ”

She committed suicide by lying on the tracks.

Her body was smashed into pieces.

Zhou Jinbei really could not imagine what kind of state a person had reached in despair before he had the courage to commit suicide by lying on the tracks!

Zhou Jinbei had once encountered a person who had committed suicide by jumping off the tracks during a train ride.

“The train whizzed past, leaving behind only a mangled corpse. ”

“For so many years, whenever Zhou Jinbei thought of that scene, he felt so uncomfortable that he could not breathe. ” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

This was because his mother had experienced the same thing.

“Sometimes, he felt that his mother was too weak and stupid. ”

Why did she have to die?

Why couldn’t she wait for him to grow up?

Her death did not exchange for Zhou Zuolong’s repentance.

The Sun would still rise in the east tomorrow.

“Instead, it helped Zhou Zuolong and Xie wanqiu, the scumbag couple. ”

“Thinking of this, Zhou Jinbei clenched his fists tightly. ”

“He only hated that he was too young at that time and did not give Wu Lan a shoulder to lean on, causing Wu Lan to choose the most extreme path. ”

The reason why Zhou Jinbei did not blame Zhou Xiang for not recognizing people clearly was because Zhou Xiang was extremely similar to Wu Lan.

His elder sister was like a mother.

“In the days when Wu Lan passed away, Zhou Xiang gave him irreplaceable love. ”

“When Zhou Jinbei was a child, he was timid. When it rained and thundered, he was so scared that he did not dare to sleep. ”

“As the elder sister, Zhou Xiang was obviously scared to death, but she pretended to be fearless, comforting Zhou Jinbei and protecting him. ”

She said with tears in her eyes that she was not afraid.

The siblings comforted each other and survived the dark period.

“Zhou Jinbei looked up at Zhou Xiang. “Elder sister, although mom committed suicide, the masterminds were Xie Wanqiu and Zhou Zuolong! If it weren’t for them, mom wouldn’t have done such an extreme thing!” ”

“Hearing that, Zhou Xiang’s eyes were filled with disbelief. ”

Was It Xie Wanqiu and Zhou Jinbei who indirectly harmed Wu Lan?

It couldn’t be.

It couldn’t be!

Zhou Xiang couldn’t believe this fact.

“Zhou Zuolong was her father whom she had respected for many years, and Xie Wanqiu was her mother whom she had personally acknowledged. How could the two of them have done something to let Wu Lan Down? ”

“”Jinbei, how did you know about this?”Zhou Xiang asked. ”

“Do you still remember Uncle Feng?”Zhou Zuolong continued to ask.

Zhou Xiang nodded. “I do. But didn’t uncle Feng’s family immigrate to C Nation three years after Mom’s accident?”

“”A month ago, I met Uncle Feng in the suburbs of C Nation,”Zhou Jinbei said slowly, “I asked him for a long time before uncle Feng was willing to tell me about the past. He told me that Mom had a fierce argument with Zhou Zuolong before she was lying on the tracks. The day after the argument, uncle Feng saw Xie Wanqiu at our house. On the third day, something happened to my mother.” ”
