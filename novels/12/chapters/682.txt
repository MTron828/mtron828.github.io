“Chapter 683: 155: stunned everyone, the youngest phd in the science and Technology field, the number one in the science and Technology Conference! 1”

Translator: 549690339

Lu Xiu’s sudden words stunned everyone in the room.

Father?

Who was he calling father?

There was Lu Xiu’s father here?

“When Cen Yuyan heard this address, she subconsciously stood up, intending to leave a good impression on Lu Xiu’s father.”

“After all, Lu Xiu’s father was very likely to be her future father-in-law.”

“Just as everyone was wondering who Lu Xiu’s father was, they saw Lu Xiu walk step by step to Ye Zhuo. The excitement on his face could not be concealed. “Father, I didn’t expect to meet you here today!””

Lu Xiu had always been a very calm person. There were very few times when he could not control his emotions.

“But today, he really could not control himself.”

“After all, YC was a legend in the science and Technology World.”

“At last year’s science and Technology Conference, YC swept through the top three in country P and directly ascended to the first place, becoming a dark horse in the industry.”

Lu Xiu had never worshipped anyone.

YC was the first.

“For YC, he even joined the ‘Niu Hulu family’and became a member of the NIU Hulu family. Perhaps it was because he was used to calling his father in the family group, so when he saw ye Zhuo.., he blurted out ‘father’.”

Lu Xiu never expected to see ye Zao at He Ziteng’s place today!

“To him, this was simply a surprise that fell from the sky!”

“At this moment, there were no words that could describe Lu Xiu’s mood.”

This feeling of meeting an idol in real life was too good!

“Ye Zao slightly raised his eyes, and there was some doubt between his brows. “You’re calling me?””

Seeing this scene.

A disdainful look appeared in Cen Yuyan’s eyes.

This ye Zao was really narcissistic.

He actually thought that Lu Xiu was calling her father.

She didn’t even look in the mirror to see how much she weighed.

She was just a small Internet celebrity.

Did she still think that Lu Xiu was one of those brainless fans who watched her live broadcast?

“At this moment, even if ye Zao wasn’t embarrassed, Cen Yuyan felt embarrassed for ye Zao.”

“If she were ye Zao, she would just find a hole and hide in it!”

She did not know how ye Zao could say this out loud.

“He was so young, why did he have no shame at all?”

He was truly shameless and invincible in the world!

Song Chenyu’s expression remained the same.

“She and Lu Xiu were old friends. The two of them had grown up together. She knew that Lu Xiu had always had a good impression of her. Lu Xiu was already over 30, but he was not married yet. It was also because he was waiting for her.”

Song Chenyu knew Lu Xiu’s personality very well.

Lu Xiu was a person who had always been indifferent to unimportant people and matters.

Why did he act so strangely in front of ye Zao today?

Because...

Ye Zao had done it beautifully?

“However, based on her understanding of Lu Xiu, Lu Xiu was not the kind of person who paid attention to his appearance.”

Could it be that ye Zao had misunderstood?

“If ye Zao had misunderstood, then this matter would be interesting.”

There were so many people in this room!

“If Lu Xiu directly denied ye Zao’s words later, then where would ye Zao put his face?”

“Ye Zao couldn’t really think that after she hooked up with Cen Shaoqing, everyone would give her face, right?”

Then she was gravely mistaken!

Lu Xiu was not the kind of person who would bow down to some evil force.

“Even if ye Zao was Cen Shaoqing’s girlfriend, Lu Xiu would never give ye Zao Face.”

Song Chenyu raised her eyes and looked at Cen Shaoqing who was standing beside ye Zao.

She was looking forward to Cen Shaoqing’s reaction in a while.

Song Chenyu originally thought that ye Zao was a smart person.

Now it seemed that.

Ye Zao was just so-so.

A truly smart person would not be as eager for quick success and instant benefits as ye Zao!

“Lu Xiu tried his best to control his agitated emotions so that he would not scare ye Zao, then, he said, “Yes, I’m calling you! Hello, YC father! My name is Lu Xiu, a c-rank engineer in the scientific and technological world, and also a member of the NIU Hulu family! I’m very happy to be able to meet you here today!””

“When Lu Xiu said this, he directly shocked everyone in the room.”

So Lu Xiu was really calling ye Zhuo father.

Didn’t they say that ye Zhuo was a small internet celebrity?

“How could a small Internet celebrity make the god of Science and Technology, Lu Xiu, act like this?”

What the hell was going on?

None of them thought that Lu Xiu was calling ye Zhuo father.

Especially Cen Yuyan.

“A second ago, Cen Yuyan was still laughing at Ye Zhuo for thinking too highly of himself.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

She didn’t expect to be slapped in the face by Lu Xiu in the next second.

She never dreamed that Lu Xiu would actually call ye Zao Daddy.

She was already prepared to please Lu Xiu’s father.

Who knew that Lu Xiu was calling ye Zao?

What right did ye Zao have?

How did ye Zao and Lu Xiu know each other?
