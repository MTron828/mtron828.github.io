“Go ahead.”

Ye Zao came up with his own solution.

“After saying that, ye Zao continued, “What do you think of My Solution?””

“Lin Jincheng hesitated for a moment before continuing, “Alright, I’ll do as you say! I’ll make the arrangements now.””

Ye Zao nodded slightly and picked up the fat cat beside him and hugged it in his arms.

“Big Zao Zao!”Little White walked out from inside and leaned its little head over. “You’re hugging this silly cat again! I want to hug it too!”

“Ye Zao glanced at it and said with disdain, “You’re too ugly!””

“Meow.”Brother Meow licked its paws elegantly and glanced at little white arrogantly.

“”I’m not ugly! I’m not only the smartest in the universe, I’m also the most handsome in the universe!”Little White raised its head, “I am much more handsome than this silly cat! This silly cat is not only the dumbest in the universe, but also the ugliest in the Universe!””

“”Meow!”Brother Meow seemed to understand the words of Whitey, stretched out his paw, facing Whitey’s face is a paw.”

You look like hell.

“”Not painful! Not Painful at all!”The small white made a grimace, “You are a silly cat, silly to marry daughter-in-law son silly cat”

“Meow brother ‘Zeng’from ye Zao body scuttled down, jumped to the head of a small white scratch.”

“Silly cat!”

“Meow!”

“Anlizi came in from outside and said with a smile, “Burning, this little white boy of yours is quite clever.””

“That is!”The small white one face proud way: “You also don’t see my father who is!”

“Who is your father?”Asked Annette Curiously.

“”Of course it’s the universe’s most beautiful great burning!”Whitey continued, “With a father so powerful, how can I not be smart? He has the universe’s most powerful AI.”” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“An lizi asked suspiciously, “Is that true?””

“”Of course it’s true!”Whitey raised its head. If it had a tail, its tail would already be in the sky.”

“Narcissistic.”She could tell that this Whitey was as narcissistic as ye Zhuo.

“”You’re the narcissistic one!”Whitey continued, “Why don’t I ask you a question to test your IQ?””

“You ask.”

Whitey cleared its throat. “Did your mother Hit You When You Were Young?”

“An Lizi nodded without hesitation. “Yes, of course she did.””

She still remembered the scene when Xia Xiaoman chased after her with a Feather Duster when she was disobedient when she was young.

“Hahaha!”Xiao Bai laughed hysterically. “Idiot! You Big Idiot!”

“? ? ?”An Lizi’s face was full of black question marks.

“Xiao Bai continued, “Let me ask you, where were you when your mother was young?””

An Lizi finally realized that she had been tricked by Xiao Bai.

Xia Xiaoman was not like her when she was young.

“Little White continued, “You are as stupid as this silly cat.””

“Brother Meow, who was licking his paws:”...”thank you, he was offended.”

“An Lizi did not expect that she would be tricked by little white. She said angrily, “Then let me ask you a question to test your IQ.””

“Ask.”

“An lizi continued, “Is the black chicken better or the white chicken better? Why?””

“Whitey smiled and said, “Of course the black chicken is better! Because the black chicken can lay white eggs, but the white chicken can’t lay black eggs.””

“”Good! You got it right!”An lizi continued, “Then let me ask you again. If the iron is left outside, it will rust. What about the gold?””

“Whitey shrugged, “Of course it was stolen. I don’t even want to answer such retarded questions. Can you ask some technical questions?””

An Lizi:”...”QWQ was so angry!

“Ye Zao glanced at the man and the machine, picked up brother Meow on the ground, and silently walked upstairs.”

“If it was not unexpected, the two of them could argue downstairs for a whole day.”

Ye Zao came to the small room upstairs.

“This was a research room, which she usually used to study medicine.”

“At this time, there was an empty bottle on the workbench.”

“Ye Zhuo picked up the rubber gloves and put them on. Then, he opened the pharmaceutical device and took out the pills inside. He put them on the tip of his nose and smelled them.”

“The white pills didn’t have any strange smell. Instead, there was a faint fragrance. It was similar to the smell of milk and roses.”

It smelled good.

Ye Zhuo curled his lips slightly and put the pills into the bottle.

“After leaving the research lab, Ye Zhuo sent a message to Wang Shuya.”

Wang Shuya replied immediately.

The two arranged to meet tomorrow morning.

“In the blink of an eye, it was the next day.”

Ye Zhuo came to the place where he met Wang Shuya.
