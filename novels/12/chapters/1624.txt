“Once C Nation took over the base, there would definitely be a huge purge. ”

Those who stayed would become the management team.

“In this situation, other than the people from the Tang family’s laboratory, who else could stay? ”

Zhang Pandi was dreaming of joining the CEN family’s laboratory.

“”Am I not already working hard?”Yu Zifei grabbed Zhang Pandi’s hand and said very seriously, “Pandi, you have to believe me. Miss Ye’s aircraft carrier plan will definitely succeed!” ”

“Once the aircraft carrier was successfully launched, the names of all the members of their Area C would be on the stage of history. ”

“Zhang Pandi looked at Yu Zifei and said, “Yu Zifei! You’re 32 years old this year! You’re already past the age of Dreaming! Wake Up!” ”

“”Pandi, you have to believe me one more time.”Yu Zifei held Zhang Pandi’s hand tightly. ”

“Zhang Pandi took a deep breath, then she said, “If I was only eighteen this year, then I would definitely wait for a miracle with you. But I am already twenty-eight this year. I have no time to waste! Go back and think about it at night! If you haven’t left Big C area by tomorrow, then we will break up!” ”

“Pandy! Do you think breaking up can be said so casually?”

“”Yu Zifei, wake up. I’m not just saying it casually. I’m very serious!”Zhang Pandy was a very realistic person. “Since you can’t give me the sense of security I want, someone can!” ”

It wasn’t that she didn’t want it.

“After saying this, Zhang Pandy turned around and left. ”

“Pandy!”Yu Zifei chased after her.

“Zhang Pandi shook off Yu Zifei’s hand. “Yu Zifei, I’m very serious now. Don’t think that I’m joking with you.” ”

Yu Zifei looked at Zhang Pandi’s back and sighed helplessly.

He had been dating Zhang Pandi for five years and was about to reach the age of marriage. Who would have thought that there would be a problem at such a critical time!

“”Brother, now is the time for you to make a choice.”Cen Hai walked over and put his arm around Yu Zifei’s shoulder. “Do you want a career or a girlfriend?” ”

“Yu Zifei smiled and said, “Pandi is just acting like a child. It will be fine in a few days!” ”

“In a few days, the launch ceremony of the aircraft carrier would be held. ”

“If the aircraft carrier plan was successful, Zhang Pandi would definitely be very happy. ”

“Thinking of that scene, Yu Zifei was a little excited. ”

“”I don’t think so.”Cen Hai looked at Zhang Pandi’s back and said, “Zhang Pandi’s heart is obviously not with you anymore!” ”

“Don’t talk nonsense.”Yu Zifei used his elbow to hit Cen Hai’s chest.

“Cen Hai continued, “Facts speak louder than words. Just wait and see! Your girlfriend is definitely not someone easy to deal with!” ”

“Yu Zifei did not take this matter to heart. She just thought that the little girl was complaining and said with a smile, “Let’s go, let’s go and eat. We have been busy for a whole day and haven’t eaten yet. I’m Starving!” ”

“”Let’s Go!”Cen Hai was energized at the mention of eating. He continued, “I haven’t even eaten breakfast! I’m Starving!” ”

The two of them laughed as they walked.

“When the others saw this, they all had complicated expressions on their faces. ” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“At a time like this, the people from Big C district could still laugh. ”

“Especially Xiao Lu. When she saw Cen Hai and Yu Zifei, the sarcasm in her eyes was overflowing. ”

“Back then, she had been punished by ye Zhuo for a small mistake. She had left the quality control department unwillingly, but she had not expected to be taken in by Tang Xue in the end. ”

“Now that she thought about it, she felt extremely fortunate. ”

“She was very clear that she had met Tang Xue. If it had not been for Tang Xue, she would still be cooped up in Area C of the university! In the future, she would still be expelled from the scientific and technological world. ”

“But now, it was different! ”

“She was a member of the Tang family’s laboratory. In the future, she would also become a manager. ”

In the high-level office.

A few leaders of the scientific and technological world were gathered for a meeting.

“Ye Zhuo stood in front of the conference table with his hands propped up in front of it. He leaned forward slightly and said, “Doctors, I believe that everyone has seen it just now. As long as everyone works together on the day of the launch ceremony, there won’t be any problems.” ”

“Dr. Warne’s face was filled with disbelief. “Miss Ye, are you sure that there won’t be any problems?” ”

“Ye Zhuo pressed the mouse, and the projector immediately converted into a 3D image and a precise formula. “The aircraft carrier rises from here and accelerates from here.” ”

“”But if it suddenly accelerates, won’t it cause weightlessness to the human body?”Chen Hao, one of the members of Feiyu team, asked. ”

“”No.”Ye Zhuo switched the screen. “As long as the defense system is turned on, no matter how fast the aircraft carrier is, it will be the same as when we were on Earth.” ”
