“Thinking of this, Feng Qianhua was very excited.”

“Old Madam Lin was also very excited. “Jin Cheng, is this news reliable?””

“After all, master Yu’s status was noble.”

“Moreover, master Yu’s personality was particularly eccentric. He always kept to himself and never interacted with any family.”

The Lin family could be considered a special case.

Lin Jincheng nodded. “Master Yu’s assistant specially called to inform me.”

“Alright.”Old Lady Lin nodded and turned to look at Auntie Zhang. “Go and call the butler over.”

She wanted to instruct the butler to clean up the entire Lin family in order to welcome master Yu.

“According to tradition, the first thing master Yu would do when he came to the capital city was to come to the Lin family.”

“Aunt Zhang said, “Alright, I’ll go now.””

“Lin Jincheng continued, “Mother, I’ll be leaving first.””

“Old Madam Lin smiled and said, “Jincheng, send Qianhua home later.””

“”Mother, I’m a married woman now,”Lin Jincheng said very seriously. “It’s really not suitable to send Qianhua home.””

“Hearing this, Feng Qianhua’s expression turned ugly for a moment.”

She had loved Lin Jincheng for so many years.

Did Lin Jincheng really have to treat her like this?

“He clearly had no feelings for ye Shu, so why was he still unwilling to look at her?”

How was she inferior to Ye Shu?

“Old Madam Lin frowned. “If I ask you to send me off, you can!””

“”Mom, I really can’t.”After saying this, Lin Jincheng did not stay any longer and turned to leave.”

“Old Madam Lin turned to look at Feng Qianhua, her face full of guilt.”

“Feng Qianhua smiled at Old Madam Lin. “Aunt Lin, I’m fine.””

...

On the other side.

Lin Qingxuan drove the car out. He had no destination and didn’t know where he could go. He just drove aimlessly.

He felt extremely depressed.

He suddenly wanted to find someone to confide in.

Lin Qingxuan took out his phone and opened his contact list. He realized that he didn’t have anyone to talk to.

“He was middle-aged, but he didn’t even have a friend to talk to.”

“Lin Qingxuan suddenly realized that he had failed. He put his phone back into his pocket, took a deep breath, and continued driving.”

“After driving for half an hour, Lin Qingxuan parked the car in the parking lot near the university city. He planned to get out and walk around.”

There were many hotels and food streets near the university town.

The university students walked together in twos and threes.

“Looking at these young faces, Lin Qingxuan felt that he also became younger.”

The last time Lin Qingxuan visited the university town was more than twenty years ago.

“At that time, the university town was not so prosperous.”

One had to say.

China had developed too quickly in recent years.

“As she walked, Lin Qingxuan walked into a quiet alley.”

“Lin Qingxuan turned around and walked back. When she turned around, she suddenly heard a voice, “Take out all the money you have!””

“I only have so much cash on me...”

“What’s the Alipay Password?”

“Lin Qingxuan frowned slightly. This voice sounded very strange. She immediately quickened her pace and walked into the alley. When she reached the corner, she saw five strong men blocking a woman and blackmailing her.”

This back view looked a little familiar.

“Lin Qingxuan narrowed her eyes and shouted, “What are you doing in broad daylight? !””

This sudden voice scared the five strong men.

They turned around and saw that Lin Qingxuan was alone. The expression on their faces became disdainful again.

One person could beat the five of them?

The woman who was being blackmailed also turned around. Her eyes instantly lit up. “Mr. Lin!”

Lin Qingxuan did not expect that the other party was actually ye Zhuo’s mother. “Ms. Xia? !”

“As if she realized something, Xia Xiaoman continued, “Mr. Lin, run quickly!”There were five of them. Lin Qingxuan alone was not their match.”

“If Lin Qingxuan ran out to call the police now, they still had a chance of survival.”

But Lin Qingxuan had no intention of running.

These strong men didn’t give Lin Qingxuan time to run either.

Want to run?

It wasn’t that easy!

“They were all people who wandered on the fringes of society, and some were even suspects on the run. They didn’t care about robbing one more person, a little fat lamb that was delivered to their door. They didn’t want to give it up for nothing. Damn”

Lin Qingxuan was full of high-end brands.

One look and one could tell that he was rich.

Everyone knew that rich people were afraid of death!

“The three strong men immediately surrounded Lin Qingcheng. The leader of the group used the back of his knife to Pat Lin Qingxuan’s face, while patting him, he said, “Brother, if you know what’s good for you, you’d better shut up and hand over the things you have on You!””
