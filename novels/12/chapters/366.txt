Translator: 549690339

“Mu Yourong’s lips curled up slightly. “In other words, as long as I can get a place in the science and Technology Conference, CEN Fifth Master will personally give me an award?” ”

Cen Shaoqing already had a very good impression of her. The reason why he had not been able to confess to her was because he had yet to understand his own heart. He was still conflicted.

“If he could let Cen Shaoqing see her at this science and Technology Conference, CEN Shaoqing would definitely confess to her immediately. ”

“At that time, she would be able to let Cen Shaoqing experience the feeling of torturing his wife for a moment and chasing after his wife to be cremated. ”

“Thinking of this, the smile on Mu Yourong’s face became even more obvious. ”

“[ it’s like this. ] The system continued, [ although there are only three winners, with the help of the system, it shouldn’t be a problem for you to get third place. ] ”

“That’s Great!”Mu Yourong stood up from the sofa and walked into the fitting room.

She installed a very large full-body mirror in the fitting room.

The light was switched on. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Mu Yourong saw herself in the fitting mirror.

Her figure was very good.

Her face was also very beautiful.

“There were still a few days before the science and Technology Conference, so she had to prepare well. ”

There were not many women who could participate in the science and Technology Conference.

“That Little Slut ye Zhuo did not have the qualifications to come to the science and Technology Conference. This time, no one was competing with her. When the time came, as the only lady who won the prize, she would be the center of attention. ”

“Mu Yourong’s lips curled up slightly, and so did the beauty in the mirror. ”

...

“In less than a day, the news that Niu Hulu YC was going to participate in the science and technology conference spread throughout the entire science and technology world. ”

The forum was very exciting.

Niu Hulu Xiaodai: [ Daddy is going to participate in the science and Technology Conference! I’m so excited! I’m so excited! ]

“Niu Hulu was happy every day: [ it seems that Daddy has read Our Ten Thousand People’s blood letter! Brothers, we are really awesome! ] ”

“Niu Hulu: [ those accounts that say that YC’s Daddy is a team dog, come out! ] ”

Niu Hulu: Year of flowing water 1985: [ dad is mighty! I Love Dad! ]

“Hua ran X R: [ the science conference hasn’t started yet, don’t be too proud! Who knows if your dad will stand you up! ] ”

“Are you an idiot? : [ actually, I’m looking forward to Niu Hulu yr! ] ”

Hua ran X R: [ plus one! I’m looking forward to YR more than Team Dog! She’s much more realistic than team dog! ]

Ye Zhuo did not know anything about these things on the forum.

She was doing a mission.

“Suddenly, she received a message. ”

“A: [ Big Brother, there are only a few days left until the science and Technology Conference. Can you add me on wechat? At that time, we will arrange for someone to pick you up at the airport. ] ”

“Ye Zhuo handled the mission with one hand and replied to him with the other: [ yes, send me a wechat message. ] ”

A: [ I’ll add you. ]

Ye Zao sent the wechat message over.

“In order to be able to distinguish between two and three dimensions, ye Zao specially applied for a new account. ”

“Very soon, the other party successfully added it. ”

“[ hello, Big Brother, I’m Chu Zimo. ] ”

[ hello. ]

“[ Big Brother, let’s meet in the capital city. ] ”

Ye Zao replied: [ see you in the capital city. ]

“On this side, Chu Zimo held his phone and immediately opened ye Zao’s moments. ”

His moments page was empty.

There were no messages.

The column for personal information was also empty.

“Chu Zimo looked at Zheng Yuanjie beside him and asked curiously, “Yuanjie, do you think that the Big Boss is a big man who likes to pick his feet?” ”

Zheng Yuanjie frowned slightly. “Maybe he’s an uncle who’s over 50 years old.”

“Ah?”Chu Zimo’s face was full of surprise. “Can the big boss be that Old?”

“Zheng Yuanjie smiled and asked, “How old is Dr. Warne this year?” ”

Chu Zimo suddenly understood.

“Usually, those who contributed to the scientific and technological world were the older ones. For example, Dr. Warne only became famous at the age of 46. ”

And the three big bosses in country P were not young either.

That was because scientific research and technology required time and research.

“Young people had not even finished their university studies, so how could they be famous in the scientific and technological world? ”

“From this, it could be seen that Big Boss YC was definitely an old man. ”

And he should be very old.

“Zheng Yuanjie continued, “Oh right, who did big boss give that extra invitation to?” ”

“”Newcomer Yr,”Chu Zimo replied. ”

“Zheng Yuanjie narrowed his eyes. “YC, YR. The prefix is the same, just one word difference. Big Boss gave her the invitation again. What do you think the relationship between the two of them is?” ”

“Chu Zimo scratched his head, “Yr is also a very energetic newcomer. She has only registered her ID for less than half a year and already has a very good result! Do you think these two are father and daughter? Otherwise, why would boss give her the invitation card?” ”
