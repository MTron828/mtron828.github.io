“Zhao pingting said, “I just started my job, so it might not be convenient for me to apply for leave.” ”

An Lizi’s face was filled with regret.

Zhao Pingting was the same.

“Ye Zhuo held Zhao Pingting’s hand and smiled. “It’s Alright, Pingting. I’ll post the wedding video in our group.” ”

Zhao pingting nodded. “Then you guys have to post more photos in the group that day. Just treat it as me attending the wedding.”

“Okay.”

“Not long after, song Shiyu looked at his watch and said slowly, “Ye Zhuo, I have a meeting later. I might have to excuse myself.” ”

“Ye Zhuo turned to look at song Shiyu. “Alright, Brother Song, you should go back now.” ”

“Song Shiyu stood up and left. “Pingting, miss an, I’ll be leaving first.” ”

“”Brother song, be careful on the road.” ”

“After song Shiyu left, Zhao Pingting looked at his back and said, “Brother song is quite handsome and has a good personality. How can he not have a girlfriend?” ”

“”A good personality?”An Lizi turned to look at Zhao pingting and continued, “Pingting, I’m afraid you have some misunderstanding about a good personality!” ”

“Why?”Zhao Pingting’s face was filled with confusion.

“An Lizi continued, “Do you know what song Shiyu’s nickname in the circle is?” ”

“What?”Zhao Pingting asked.

“An Lizi said slowly, “King Yama.” ”

“After saying that.., an lizi continued, “Actually, in recent years, song Shiyu has restrained himself quite a bit. I heard that when he was still a minor, he was imprisoned in the Juvenile Detention Center for many years because he killed his father. “Anyway, the people in the circle have a very bad impression of him. “Before I met him, I didn’t have a good impression of him.” ”

“Ah?”Zhao Pingting was surprised.

Song Shiyu didn’t look like this kind of person.

“During this period of time, song Shiyu had always been like a spring breeze. ”

An Lizi continued to explain many things about song Shiyu to Zhao Pingting.

...

In the infirmary.

“Song Shiyu sat on a chair expressionlessly, allowing doctor Liu to examine him. ”

“Bai Jiayu also sat beside him and said, “Third brother, what did you do? You made yourself look like this!” ”

Song Shiyu was in a very bad condition. Red bumps were growing all over his body.

“Hearing this, song Shiyu did not say anything. ”

“Doctor Liu continued, “Boss song is allergic to prawns. Luckily, he came back in time. Otherwise, he might go into shock at any time.” ”

He was not afraid of shock.

He was just afraid that ye Zhuo would find out something was wrong.

“Bai Jiayu frowned. “Third brother, What’s going on? Did you get ambushed?” ”

Song Shiyu’s constitution was not good and he was allergic to many things.

Especially prawns.

“Therefore, song Shiyu definitely ate prawns without knowing. ”

“Furthermore, the other party was definitely someone who knew song Shiyu very well. ”

Who Was It?

Who wanted to harm song Shiyu?

“”No,”song Shiyu said slowly. “I ate it myself.” ”

Bai Jiayu widened his eyes in disbelief. “Why?”

Self-torture?

“Song Shiyu said unhurriedly, “It’s nothing.” ”

“Bai Jiayu narrowed his eyes. “Third brother, there’s something very wrong with you!” ”

He had definitely met someone?

“”It’s Ye...”before Bai Jiayu could finish his sentence, he was interrupted by Song Shiyu. “It has nothing to do with anyone. It’s me who wants to taste what shrimp tastes like.” ” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Bai Jiayu took a look at song Shiyu. His eyes were actually filled with heartache.

Song Shiyu was such a proud person.

“But now, he had become like this... ”

“”Third brother.”Bai Jiayu squatted down and looked up at Song Shiyu. “Actually, you don’t have to put yourself through this. If you like it, go and fight for it. Life is so long. Don’t leave yourself with regrets.” ”

“He laughed when he was happy, cried when he was sad, and chased after the person he liked. ”

Why was there a need to be so tired?

“With song Shiyu’s current status, there was no need for him to do that. ”

“”Yeah, life is like a spring in the grass.”Song Shiyu sighed softly. “Jiayu, Cherish Little Tang well.” ”

Little Tang was Bai Jiayu’s current girlfriend.

“The two of them were on and off, and they had feelings for each other. However, Bai Jiayu felt that there was something missing, so he didn’t care. ”

“Bai Jiayu was a little speechless. “Third brother, we’re talking about you now! What are you CUE me for?” ”

“I just don’t want you to regret it.”

“Song Shiyu paused and turned to look at the completely dark sky outside, “I should have been a dead man twenty years ago, but God gave me another life. I’ve already avenged what I should have. What else am I not satisfied with?” ”

“Bai Jiayu looked at him, speechless for a long time. ”

“After a long time, Bai Jiayu continued, “Third brother...” ”
