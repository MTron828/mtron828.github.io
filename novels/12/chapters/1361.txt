Chapter 1362: Xie wanqiu’s face turned pale when she saw this

Translator: 549690339

A Fool is a fool.

“Other people grow their brains to think about problems and distinguish right from wrong, but her brain is nothing but a decoration. ”

It can’t even be compared to a decoration.

Pin Xi XI socialite?

“Zhou Xiang of course knew about pin XI socialite, who was popular all over the internet a while ago. ”

What did Zhou Zuolong Mean?

Did he mean that ye Zhuo was a pin XI celebrity?

“”Dad, What are you talking about? Zhuolong is not a pin XI celebrity! She is the rightful eldest daughter of the Lin family, and she is Miracle Doctor Ye who can be recorded in history!” ”

Recorded in history?

Just Ye Zhuo? Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Hearing this, the disdain on Zhou Zuolong’s face was almost overflowing. He did not know whether to be angry or laugh. He did not understand why Zhou Xiang was so stupid! ”

She could even say such unrealistic words like ‘chronicling history’!

Was She Dreaming?

“She was such a person, yet old lady CEN had taken a liking to her at that time. ”

“Oh, he had forgotten. ”

Old Lady Cen was just like Zhou Xiang. She was also an idiot.

“Otherwise, Old Lady Cen would not have chosen Zhou Xiang as her daughter-in-law. ”

“”Chronicling history? A joke in History?”Zhou zuolong continued, “Xiang Xiang, you are an elder now. Don’t you know that you have to think before you speak or do anything?” ”

No wonder Xie Wanqiu was wary of Zhou Xiang and Old Lady Cen being deceived by Ye Zao.

“With Zhou Xiang’s IQ, it would be strange if she was not deceived! ”

She was even more retarded than a three-year-old child!

“”Dad, I’m serious. Zao Zao is really the Miracle Doctor Ye who cured cancer! Do you think I would use such a thing to deceive you?” ”

“As the saying goes, one should not argue with a fool. ”

Zhou Xiang was even more foolish than a fool. What could she say to her?

“Zhou Zuolong raised his hand and continued, “I just want to ask you one thing. Do you want Shaoqing to break up with Ye Zhuo or not?” ”

“Zhou Xiang frowned slightly. “Dad, I’ve already made myself clear. Why Can’t you understand?” ”

“Zhou Xiang had a soft personality and did not have any opinions. Therefore, no matter what request Zhou Zuolong made, Zhou Xiang would unconditionally meet it. ”

But today.

Zhou Xiang had actually rejected him.

And it was not just once.

This made Zhou Zuolong unable to accept it.

Zhou Zuolong looked at Zhou Xiang. “What do you mean by this? You look down on yinyin?”

“”It’s not that I look down on yinyin,”Zhou Xiang continued, “It’s just that yinyin and Shaoqing are not suitable. Shaoqing already has a girlfriend. Dad, don’t get involved in this matter. I’m begging you, okay?” ”

“Hearing this, Zhou Zuolong’s expression turned ugly. “Are you blaming me for meddling in other people’s business?” ”

“Zhou xiang patiently explained, “Dad, it’s Shaoqing’s own right to be with anyone. He’s already an adult. Whether it’s me or you, neither of us have the right to interfere in his personal life. Why do you have to misinterpret my meaning?” ”

“Hearing this, Zhou Zuolong became even angrier. ”

What did Zhou Xiang Mean?

Was she referring to the fact that his maternal grandfather had no right to interfere in CEN Shaoqing’s matters?

Did Zhou Xiang still care about his biological father?

“”Why is it that your mother-in-law can arrange a girlfriend for Shaoqing, but I can’t? Could it be that my maternal grandfather can’t compare to that grandmother of hers? Without me, how could I have you? Without You, how could Cen Shaoqing have what he has today?” ”

Xie wanqiu had already told Zhou Zuolong that ye Zhuo was arranged by old madam Cen for Cen Shaoqing.

“To put it bluntly, Old Madam Cen had been deceived by Ye Zhuo. ”

“An old fool had arranged for his biological grandson to be a celebrity on the eve of the festival, and was still so pleased with himself that he thought that she had found some fairy from the nine heavens! ”

It was simply a joke if it was spread out.

“Bai Tang had introduced a celebrity on the eve of the festival to Cen Shaoqing, but Cen Shaoqing could accept it. The girl he had introduced to Cen Shaoqing was the most outstanding girl in the world! ”

Cen Shaoqing would only reject it if he was blind.

“As long as Cen Shaoqing was sensible, he would be very grateful to him. ”

“After all, Zheng Wanyin was more than ten times better than ye Zao! ”

“Zhou Xiang explained, “Dad, although my mom was the one who introduced Zao Zao to Shaoqing in the beginning, things are not what you think. “Shaoqing knew Zao Zao Zao before my mom set him up with Zao Zao, and he already had a good impression of Zao Zao. So, they can be considered to be in a free relationship! “You should know Shaoqing’s temper. As long as he doesn’t want to, let alone my mother, even if the Emperor comes, he won’t be able to do anything to him!” ”

Excuses.

“In Zhou Zuolong’s view, Zhou Xiang’s words were all excuses. ”

“Ye Zhuluo was obviously forced onto Cen Shaoqing by Old Lady Cen, but Zhou Xiang insisted that they were free love! ”

Cen Shaoqing is Who?
