Translator: 549690339

In an instant.

Li Qiandong had no good impression of ye Zao at all.

She had thought that ye Zao was different from other girls.

“But now, it seemed that ye Zao was not as beautiful as he had imagined. ”

He had come to ye Zao with all his schemes just to marry Cen Shaoqing.

He had misjudged ye Zao!

“Li Qiandong was very angry now. He raised his head and looked at Old Madam Cen. “Old Madam, let me say something unpleasant. Don’t be angry. Ye Zao is too scheming. Since ancient times, beauties have caused disasters. She doesn’t deserve fifth brother at all...” ”

Old Madam Cen did not want to argue with a junior like Li Qiandong.

“But now, he actually said something bad about ye Zao behind his back! ”

How could she endure this?

She couldn’t endure it!

“Old Madam Cen directly interrupted Li Qiandong’s unfinished words, “Shut up! You shut up for me! You Son of a bitch! You dare to speak ill of my granddaughter-in-law! My granddaughter-in-law is the bright moon in the sky, and she, Mu Yourong, can’t even compare to the mud on the ground! I see that your brain is filled with water, and your small brain raises fish! Your eyes are even blind! You Can’t even tell good from bad! Little Zhao, Little Qian, Little Sun, Little Li! Come out quickly!” ”

“Old Lady!”Four strong men wearing sunglasses immediately walked out of the door.

These four were the Cen family’s bodyguards.

They were usually in charge of Old Lady Cen’s safety.

“Li Qiandong still wanted to say something. “Old Lady, I’m telling the truth...” ”

“Old Lady Cen did not give him the chance. She said angrily, “Little Zhao, Little Qian, Little Sun, Little Li! All of you, seal this son of a bitch’s mouth!” ”

The four bodyguards were quick and ruthless. Li Qiandong’s mouth was immediately sealed by tape and he could not say a single word.

“Old Mrs. Cen pointed at the door and said, “Throw him out! Throw him out right now! From now on, he is not allowed to step into our Cen family ever again!” ”

“”Yes, Old Mrs. Cen.” ”

The four bodyguards dragged Li Qiandong away.

“Although Li Qiandong’s skills were not bad, these four bodyguards had trained before! ”

How could he be a match for these four people!

Li Qiandong was unable to speak and he was so angry that he was about to explode!

“Could it be that when people got old, they could not differentiate between good and bad? ”

“Clearly, old Madam Cen was not like this in the past! ”

“Seeing Li Qiandong being dragged away, old Madam Cen was still very angry, but she still comforted herself. “I’m not angry at all! I’m not angry at all! If I’m angry, I’ll get wrinkles!” ”

“Zhou Xiang heard that something was wrong downstairs and came down from upstairs, “Mom, What’s Wrong?” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen finally managed to calm down her anger, but at this moment, it burst out again, “It’s that kid from the Li Family! I’m so angry! He actually dared to say bad things about my granddaughter-in-law!” ”

“What’s going on?”Zhou Xiang was a little curious.

“Old Mrs. Cen told the whole story. Hearing this, Zhou Xiang was also very angry, “What’s wrong with this kid, Qiandong? I remember that he used to be quite sensible!” ”

“”He must be blind! I think Old Li’s family is about to be broken by him! To think that our fifth and Shaoqing are so good to him!”Old Mrs. Cen took off her costume, “No! I have to go find my granddaughter-in-law! I Can’t let this bastard go to my granddaughter-in-law and talk nonsense! Nonsense!” ”

“I’ll go with you.”Zhou Xiang stood up.

Old Mrs. Cen waved her hand. “I’ll go alone! Get Someone to keep an eye on that son of a B * Tch!”

“Okay!”Zhou Xiang nodded.

Old Mrs. Cen went into the house to change her clothes and then went out.

She had developed a good habit of changing clothes when she went out.

“When the car passed by a fruit supermarket, old Mrs. Cen suddenly said, “Xiao Li, stop for a moment. I’m going to the car to buy fruit! My granddaughter-in-law likes to eat mangosteen from this house.” ”

“Xiao Li said, “Old Mrs. Cen, wait in the car. I’ll go over and buy some.” ”

“Just wait in the car!”How could she let someone else buy fruit for her granddaughter-in-law! She had to choose the fruit herself!

Old Mrs. Cen got off the car and walked to the fruit supermarket.

“Not only did she buy mangosteen, she also bought Lychees and a bunch of other fruits that ye Zao liked to eat. ”

“Just as Old Mrs. Cen was carrying a bunch of fruits out, she was suddenly hit by someone. ”

Bang —

The fruits scattered all over the ground.

Old Madam Cen was also hit to the ground. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“At the same time, a shrill voice came from the air, “Damn Old Woman! Don’t you have eyes?” ”

Old Madam Cen instantly flew into a rage!

She had hit someone and still dared to scold her!

“Raising her head, she saw a familiar face. ”

It was Mu Yourong!

“In the past, Mu Yourong would definitely not come personally to buy fruits, but this was not the past. Their family no longer had any servants. ”
