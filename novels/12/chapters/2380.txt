Cen Shaoqing had something to do with honesty?

“”I know who Shaoqing is.”Ye Shu put down her chopsticks and said with a smile, “By the way, are you busy recently, Zhuozhuo?” ”

“”I’m okay. I’m not too busy,”ye Zhuozhuo said. ”

“Ye Shu continued, “If you’re not busy, accompany me to the mall tomorrow.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

On the other side.

At the CEN residence.

“Old Mrs. Cen was sitting on the sofa, holding half a watermelon in her hand. She turned to look at Cen Shaoqing. “Fifth girl!” ”

“Hearing this address, Cen Shaoqing rubbed his nose but did not say anything. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen snorted lightly. “Brat! You even learned to look at people and make dishes. When Zhuo Zhuo called you fifth girl, you agreed more than anyone else. When it’s your grandmother’s turn, you must be deaf, right?” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen had observed that every time ye Zhuo called Cen Shaoqing like that, not only did Cen Shaoqing not get angry, but a flower almost blossomed on his face. ”

How could it be like this!

“Cen Shaoqing looked back slightly. “Zhongruo calling me that is the joy of the boudoir. Grandmother, when I was five years old, you could call me that. How Old Am I Now?” ”

“In fact, Cen Shaoqing had already been unable to accept such a nickname when he was five years old. ”

“However, he was too young at that time and did not have much authority. Hence, after he was in his teens, he resisted this nickname with all his might. Gradually, he gained control of the Cen family and no one dared to call him that anymore. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen snorted coldly and said, “I think you need to be taught a lesson!” ”

Cen Shaoqing took a sip of tea and did not say anything.

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Oh right, Zhuozhuo has graduated. When do you plan to propose?” ”

“As time passed, old Mrs. Cen was more anxious to hold her great-grandson. ”

Life was a matter of closing and opening one’s eyes.

She did not want to leave any regrets before closing her eyes.

“No Rush.”Cen Shaoqing’s expression was normal.

No Rush?

“Hearing this, Old Mrs. Cen’s face was full of disbelief. ”

Cen Shaoqing wouldn’t be in a rush?

How was that possible!

“”You Brat, why are you still pretending in front of your grandmother!”Old Mrs. Cen rolled her eyes at Cen Shaoqing. ”

“CEN shaoqing continued, “Searing has just graduated, I’m really not in a rush.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing changed the topic and continued, “But if you’re in a hurry, I can force myself to be in a hurry.” ”

Cen Shaoqing was serious. It was as if he was really not in a hurry.

“In fact, a certain someone’s heart was already scratching like a cat’s Paw. It could not be stopped. ”

“”Brat!”Old Madam Cen was a little speechless and said, “With you like this, you seem to be getting married. If it wasn’t for me, the Invincible and good grandmother of the universe, you’d be waiting to be a bachelor for the rest of Your Life!” ”

“Cen Shaoqing put down the cup in his hand. He still wore a serious look on his face. “Yes, yes, yes. Grandma, whatever you say is right.” ” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

This made it seem like old Mrs. Cen was the one who was being unreasonable.

“Why are you such a child?”Old Mrs. Cen said with a frown.

“Cen Shaoqing stood up from the sofa. “Grandma, I still have something to take care of. I want to go upstairs.” ”

Old Mrs. Cen also stood up. “Wait a moment.”

“Do you still have something to do?”Cen Shaoqing looked back slightly.

Old Mrs. Cen walked over. “Lower Your Head and hit me.”

“Cen Shaoqing was 193 and old Mrs. Cen was 158. The distance between the two was 35 centimeters. Every time she spoke to Cen Shaoqing, Old Mrs. Cen would raise her head. ”

“Cen Shaoqing bent slightly. “Other than your head, you can hit me anywhere you want.” ”

“”Why?”Old Mrs. Cen put her hands on her hips, looking like an old blackmailer that she couldn’t afford to offend. ”

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “Because my head can only be hit when it’s burning.” ”

“Show!”Old Mrs. Cen gave Cen Shaoqing a thumbs up.

She had nothing to say to that.

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “Do you still want to hit me? If you don’t, I’ll go upstairs first.” ”

Old Mrs. Cen stood on the small stool and slapped Cen Shaoqing on the shoulder. “Kneel and be at peace!”

An elder in the family was like having a treasure. Cen Shaoqing smiled helplessly and turned to walk upstairs.

“Seeing that Cen Shaoqing’s figure was about to disappear upstairs, old Mrs. Cen continued, “Wait a minute.” ”

Cen Shaoqing looked back slightly. “What else do you want to tell me?”

“”About the matter between you and searing flame, when are you going to propose?”Old Mrs. Cen asked. ”

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “Since you’ve already said it, I’ll definitely do it as soon as possible.” ”
