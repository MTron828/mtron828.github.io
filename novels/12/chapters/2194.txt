Support Him?

Ye Zhuo actually said that he was going to support him.

This made Leo stunned.

What kind of person would be able to make ye Zhuo support him?

“Leo asked curiously, “Father Zhuo, who are we going to support?” ”

Ye Zhuo looked up slightly. “Guess.”

“”I can’t guess,”Leo said. ”

“You’ll know when you get there.”

“After saying that, ye Zao continued, “See you in the square in ten minutes.” ”

“Okay.”

“After cutting off the communicator, ye Zao changed his clothes and flew the aircraft to the square. ” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“As soon as the aircraft landed, Leo welcomed it. ”

“Father Zao!”

“Ye Zao put his hands on the railing of the aircraft and jumped lightly, landing on the ground just like that. His posture was a little handsome, and people could not help but want to whistle. ”

“Are you alone? Where’s Ye Han?”

“Leo looked at his watch. “He asked me to come over first, but it should be almost time.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Leo continued, “Father Zhuo, have you called Mr. Feng?” ”

“”No,”ye Zhuo continued, “Mr. Feng has been quite busy recently.” ”

“As they were talking, the sound of the aircraft came from the sky again. ”

“It must be ye Han.”Leo looked at the sky.

The aircraft was getting closer and closer.

“Leo narrowed his eyes, “It looks a bit like Mr. Feng’s aircraft.” ”

“It’s him.”Ye Zao raised his eyes slightly.

“Soon, the aircraft landed. ”

“Mr. Feng got down from the aircraft. As usual, he first knelt on one knee before standing up. ”

“Leo immediately walked over and asked curiously, “Old Feng, why are you here?” ”

“”All of you are here. How can I Not Be Here?”Mr. Feng turned to look at Ye Zao, then, he said, “Miss Ye, I’ve said before that as long as miss ye needs me, no matter where I am, I will definitely be unimpeded. In the future, if Miss Ye needs help, please let me know.” ”

“”Actually, it’s just a small matter.”Ye Zhuo continued, “There’s no need to trouble you to make a trip.” ”

“”Miss Ye, if you say that, then you’re treating me as an outsider!”Mr. Feng continued, “You don’t have to thank me either. If you say thank you to me, then how many times do I have to thank you?” ”

“If it wasn’t for the Ye Zhuo from back then, how would he be the current him? ”

That debt of gratitude would be unforgettable even in death.

“Leo patted Mr. Feng’s shoulder and said with a smile, “At least you, this old kid, are loyal! Miss Ye didn’t help the wrong person back then.” ”

“Ye Zhuo raised his eyes slightly and continued, “Mr. Feng, the matter back then is already in the past. You Don’t have to keep it in mind. Over these years, you’ve already helped me a lot.” ”

“Speaking up to this point, Leo was a little curious. ”

He had never known what had happened between Ye Zhuo and the Feng clan back then.

“Not long after, Ye Han also came. ”

Ye Han did not come alone. Guangxing and the great clan leader also came.

“Grandma!”Guangxing saw ye Zhuo and rushed over happily.

“Guangxing.”Ye Zhuo looked back slightly.

“Leo and Mr. Feng looked at each other, not quite understanding what was going on. ”

When did ye Zao have such a grandson?

And guangxing called him so affectionately.

The most depressed person should be the head of the clan.

He was the same generation as Guangxing’s father. If guangxing called ye Zao Grandma.

Then what should he call ye Zao?

Mom?

“Thinking of this, the head of the clan was even more depressed. ”

Guang Xing was usually very normal. Why did he become a child when he came to Ye Zhuo’s place?

“What the head chief could not understand was that the two of them were clearly not that different, but Guang Xing called ye Zhuo grandmother without any sense of dissonance. ”

“Guang Xing took out a pile of glittering glass beads from his pocket. “Grandmother, do you think these beads look good?” ”

“Under the sunlight, the colorful glass beads emitted a dazzling light. ”

It was especially beautiful.

“They’re okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Guangxing stuffed all the glass beads into ye Zhuo’s hands. “Grandma, these beads are for you.” ”

“Thank you.”Ye Zhuo did not decline and just took it as coaxing the child to be happy.

“Sure enough, after ye Zhuo took the beads, the smile on Guangxing’s face became even more intense. ”

He was just like a child who had done something that his parents had approved of. He was very happy.

“Guangxing continued, “My grandfather didn’t come?” ”

“”Grandfather?”Ye Zao was stunned for a moment before he reacted, “Are you referring to Cen Shaoqing?” ”

“Yes.”Guangxing nodded.

The mouth of the head chief standing behind the two twitched slightly. Guangxing this kid really knew how to recognize relatives. He was not afraid that the coffin of the Guang family’s ancestor would not be able to cover it.
