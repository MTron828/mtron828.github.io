“For the so-called position of the General Alliance, he would even give up his blood relatives and loved ones? ”

“In Cen Shaoqing’s memory, his father loved his mother very much. ”

He had always been puzzled as to why Cen Haifeng would do this.

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Don’t think too much. The test results are not out yet. What if he’s not an uncle?” ”

“Actually, Ye Zhuo was also conflicted. ”

She hoped that old Mrs. Cen and Zhou Xiang could see their son and husband and reunite as a family soon.

But she was also afraid that they would see the truth.

“After all, the truth was too cruel. ”

No matter what had happened in between.

“It was true that Cen Haifeng had abandoned his wife and children, and it was also true that he had married someone else in another country. ”

“Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “If the test results are out, don’t hide it from me.” ”

“Ye Zhuo looked at Cen Shaoqing. “Don’t worry, it won’t happen. As soon as there’s a result, Ye Han will immediately inform me.” ” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“They used a special wireless communication device and could also contact ye Han, who was in the S Galaxy, on Earth. However, the number of times they could contact him was limited. ”

They could only contact him once a month.

“Every time, it would take five minutes. ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “Okay.”

“After saying that, ye Zhuo continued, “By the way, do you want to take out the chip from your body immediately?” ”

“Cen Shaoqing pursed his thin lips slightly. After a moment, he said, “What do you think?”? ”

“The alliance had implanted the chip in his body for a reason. If they forcefully took it, there would definitely be an abnormality. ”

“However, if he did not take it, Cen Shaoqing felt that the chip was restricting his ability to think. ”

“For a moment, he actually fell into a dilemma. ”

“Ye Zhuo thought for a moment and then said, “I think that in order to avoid alerting the enemy, you should not take it for the time being. Wait and see.” ”

“After all, this chip did not have much of an impact on CEN Shaoqing. ”

“Cen Shaoqing had been through this for so many years, so he did not need to care about such a short period of time. ”

“I’ll listen to you.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“At this moment, there was a knock on the door. “Miss Ye.” ”

“”Come in,”ye Zhuo said softly. ”

“The new assistant walked in. “Miss Ye, this is the information you requested.” ”

“Put it there.”

The assistant placed the information on the side of Ye Zhuo and turned to leave.

“Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly. He keenly sensed that something was wrong. Just as he was about to stand up, Ye Zhuo casually held his hand and signaled her with his eyes not to act rashly. ”

“When the assistant had completely disappeared outside the door, Cen Shaoqing looked at Ye Zhuo. “What’s Going On?” ”

“I’ve already discovered that Core Robot.”Ye Zhuo’s tone was indifferent.

Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly. “Then you’re still keeping it.”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “Don’t worry. She doesn’t have any ill intentions. It’s not a big deal if she stays.” ”

“Do you know who sent it?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“I know.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Who?”

Ye Zhuo took a sip of tea. “Man Wen.”

Ye Zhuo was a very intelligent person. She had long seen through man Wen’s disguise in the man family.

“In fact, the matter between her and the man family had nothing to do with Man Wen. ”

“From a certain perspective, man Wen was a very good younger brother. ”

The reason why he cooperated with Ye Han to beat up man Wen was to put on a show.

“He didn’t chase away the core robots that man Wen had arranged for him, in order to make man Wen feel at ease. ”

“Man Wen was treading on thin ice in the man family. If she got too close to man Wen, she would definitely bring trouble to man Wen. ”

He couldn’t let man Wen’s efforts all these years go down the drain.

“Who is man Wen?”Cen Shaoqing narrowed his phoenix-like eyes.

“Subconsciously, he felt that this name was a little like a man’s. ”

“A man or a woman?”Cen Shaoqing continued to ask.

“”A man,”ye Zhuo replied. ”

“Hearing this, Cen Shaoqing turned to look at Ye Zhuo. ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “Don’t worry, listen to me.” ”

“”Man Wen might be my younger brother in Chang Yue Country,”ye Zhuo continued to tell Cen Shaoqing about what he had done in the s galaxy. ”

“Hearing this, Cen Shaoqing frowned. “How can such a person be a parent?” ”

How could a parent give up on their own daughter twice?

“Hearing this, other than man Wen, the rest of the family were not good people. ”

“”Zhonghua, you were right not to recognize them.” ”

“Ye Zhonghua smiled and said, “I am ye Zhonghua now. I have nothing to do with them to begin with.” ”

“Ye Zhonghua, who was related to them by blood, had long disappeared. ”

Cen Shaoqing had never heard ye Zhuo talk about her childhood. She only knew that she was raised by a grandmother who was not related by blood. She did not know that so many things had happened in between.
