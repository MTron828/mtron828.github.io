Tang Xue finally understood what was going on and frowned.

“You said that you weren’t accepted?”

“”Yes.”Bai Yun nodded. “SIS, what’s Going On? Did someone impersonate me?” ”

How would Tang Xue Know What was going on.

She had clearly made a deal with the assessment head!

“Tang Xue walked to her desk, picked up the microphone, and made a call. “Get Me the Assessment Department.” ”

“”Yes, Miss Tang. Please wait a moment.” ” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Soon, the call was connected. ”

“”Check Bai Yun’s results for me,”Tang Xue said. ”

“Please Wait a moment. Check the admission ticket number.”

“After checking the admission ticket number, the other side continued, “Bai Yun has 0 points.” ”

“The CEN base’s assessment was very strict, with a total of 50 points. Even if it was a top student with rich combat experience, it was very rare for them to get a full score, let alone Bai Yun, who knew nothing about scientific research, it was too normal to get 0 points. ”

0 points.

Bai Yun actually got 0 points.

She had clearly informed the head examiner that Bai Yun shouldn’t have only gotten 0 points.

How dare he!

How dare he!

“Although Old Master Tang was no longer around, the gratitude he had shown the head examiner when he was still alive was still there. ”

Ungrateful.

Tang Xue had never expected that the head examiner would call her Xiao Xue on the surface and be extremely affectionate. He even said that he wanted to take her as his biological granddaughter. She had never expected that the mainland would not even give her this bit of face!

“The world was really cold and people died like extinguished lamps. Now That Old Master Tang was no longer around, all of them had changed their faces. ”

Old Master Tang should not have helped the assessment leader back then.

Tang Xue was very angry!

“Bai Yun walked to Tang Xue’s side and continued, “Sister, what should we do now? Can I still be accepted by the base? Help me go to the assessment office and Talk About It!” ”

“Tang Xue was already very angry. Now that she heard Bai Yun’s words, she was even more furious. “Even if the announcer did not mention your name, you can’t go to the broadcast room and cause trouble! Do you know how much you have embarrassed me? !” ”

“Now, everyone in the base knew that this idiot, Bai Yun, was her sister! ”

Bai Yun lowered her head and didn’t say a word.

She had thought that Tang Xue had great authority!

She didn’t expect that Tang Xue’s authority wasn’t even comparable to that of a head of the security department.

“Tang Xue continued, “You can go back first!” ”

Go Back?

“Since Bai Yun was here, she didn’t want to go back just like that. ”

“Bai Yun looked at Tang Xue in surprise, “Sis! I’m here to participate in the CEN Base’s assessment competition! Everyone around me knows that I’ve been accepted by the CEN base. What’s the point of going back now!”Wasn’t it embarrassing? ”

“Do you know how many points you scored?”Tang Xue asked.

“I don’t know.”

“”0 points!”Tang Xue said angrily, “You want to join the CEN base even though you scored 0 points?” ”

“Bai Yun snorted and said confidently, “Isn’t that because of you?” ”

She studied finance. It would be strange if she could get full marks!

“If she didn’t have Tang Xue as her backing, Bai Yun wouldn’t have come to participate in this assessment. ”

Tang Xue was so angry that her head hurt.

How could she have such a useless cousin?

Why was she so confident when she got 0 points?

“Bai Yun continued, “If I knew you couldn’t do it, I wouldn’t have come!” ”

Couldn’t?

She couldn’t?

Tang Xue felt her dignity being trampled on by Bai Yun.

She was the backbone of the Cen family base.

The descendant of Old Master Tang!

“Before ye Zhuo appeared, she was the youngest female doctor in the base. ”

Who wouldn’t address her as Miss Tang?

But now.

Bai Yun actually questioned her strength!

It was all that damned old man Zhou Guangwei’s fault!

“If it wasn’t for his ingratitude, Bai Yun wouldn’t have only gotten 0 points. ”

“Whenever she thought of Zhou Guangwei, Tang Xue would be extremely angry. ”

Zhou Guangwei’s position as the test leader had been brought up by Old Master Yang.

She didn’t expect Zhou Guangwei to forget so quickly!

“After a while, Tang Xue turned to look at Bai Yun and said, “Go back and wait.” ”

Wait?

“When she heard this, Bai Yun’s eyes lit up. Could it be that she still had a chance? ”

“”Then I still have a chance, right?”Bai Yun looked at Tang Xue. “Sister, you’ve already promised me! You Can’t go back on your word!” ”

“Tang Xue narrowed her eyes and continued, “When Ye Zhuo’s two-year agreement expires, I will definitely let you enter the base and let you be the management of the base.” ”

“Two years later, even the entire CEN group’s base would be hers. What else could she not decide. ”

“At that time, not to mention Zhou Guangwei, even ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing would have to see her face! ”
