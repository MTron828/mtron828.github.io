Chapter 106: 075: dinner, thousand miles of gratitude! 6

Ye Zhuosubai’s fingers picked up a chess piece, and his tone was indifferent. “This game is called the mantis stalks the cicada, but the oriole is behind.”

“High! Really High!”Cen Shaoqing was not stingy with his praise. “What a good mantis stalks the cicada and the oriole is behind!”

Ye zhuosubai said modestly, “It’s just average, you’re too stupid.”

For the first time in his life, the high and Mighty Cen Fifth Master was pointed at his nose and said he was stupid!

Moreover, that person was only a little girl.

However, not only was he not angry, he said instead, “It’s because I’m short-sighted and didn’t see that I was out of the game.”

“Actually, your go skills are pretty good,”ye zhuo continued, “Usually, very few people can make me use my real skills. You’re the first one. Oh, it shouldn’t be the second one.”

The first person should be that Netizen called layman.

“Then who’s the first one?”Cen Shaoqing furrowed his brows.

Ye Zhuo said concisely, “It’s a netizen that I met during the live broadcast.”

Netizen?

Which Netizen?

Was it a man or a woman?

How Old was he?

Where did he live?

Had they met before?

Perhaps even Cen Shaoqing himself did not realize that not only had he thought of so many questions, he had even furrowed his brows.

Ye Zhuo picked up his cup and took a sip of tea. “Mr. Cen, it’s getting late. I should go back to the hotel.”

Cen Shaoqing had wanted to play another round, but when he heard what ye Zhuo said, he immediately stood up and said, “I’ll send you off.”

“Then I’ll have to trouble Mr. Cen.”Ye Zhuo stood up, put on his coat and hat.

Cen Shaoqing also picked up the suit hanging at the side and put it on.

“It’s my pleasure.”

About ten minutes later, the car stopped in front of the hotel.

Ye Zhuo got out of the car and said goodbye to Cen Shaoqing. He also told him to drive safely on the road.

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “I will.”

Ye Zhuo turned around and walked towards the hotel.

As soon as they arrived at the hotel, Lin Shasha gossiped, “How was it? Did you get along well with Mr. Cen?”

Ye Zao nodded slightly, “It was alright.”

Lin Sha Looked Ye Zao up and down and felt that the two of them were very promising.

One was handsome.

The other was beautiful.

Both of them were especially good. They were simply a perfect match!

Ye Zao continued, “Sister Sha Sha, let’s go back tomorrow. Have you prepared your luggage?”

Lin sha nodded, “Don’t worry, it’s already prepared.”

The next morning, the two of them arrived at the airport.

On the plane.

Lin Shasha said with some worry, “It’s almost the new year, and I haven’t found a job yet. Zhuozhuo, what kind of job do you think I should find after the New Year?”

Lin Shasha had been working in the factory.

The life in the factory was dull and boring. She did the same thing every day. Lin Shasha wanted to change her job.

However, she did not know anything.

She could not find a suitable job at all.

Ye Zhuo looked up slightly, “Sister Sha Sha, you are only twenty years old this year. If I Were you, I would not choose to work. I would pick up my books again and study for the third year of high school. I would take the college entrance exam the year after next. I would take the college entrance exam that I want to take. I would study the major that I like. After graduation, I would do what I want to do.”

Lin Shasha looked at Ye Zhuo in surprise. “But I’m already twenty years old this year!”

Ye Zhuo smiled slightly, “Sister Shasha, you’re only two years older than me. I’m only in the third year of high school this year, and I’ll take the college entrance exam next year. “You should go back and review the high school curriculum. Next year, you’ll transfer to the third year of high school, and the year after that, you’ll take the college entrance exam. You’ll only be one year younger than me. Twenty years old is just the beginning of your life.”

Studying was not the only way out.

But studying was the best way out for Lin Sha.

Moreover, no matter where she went to work now, her education was the most important!

Lin Sha was a little hesitant when ye Zhuo spoke so seriously. “Can I really do it, Zhuozhuo?”

Ye Zhuo nodded. “Sister Sha Sha, if you want to learn, I can help you review.”

After saying that, ye Zhuo continued, “By the way, Sister Shasha, what was your dream when you were in school?”

Lin Shasha thought for a long time. “In the past, my dream was to be a lawyer.”

“Then work hard towards this goal! Get into the University of Political Science and Law! Become an excellent lawyer! Sister Shasha, you are 20 years old this year. The year after next, you will be 22 years old when you take the college entrance exam. After graduating from university, you will be 26 years old. If you go to graduate school, you will do two years of graduate school and three years of graduate school. No matter which one you graduate from, you will not be 30 years old! “30 years old. Do you want to live as you want to live, or do you want to be a housewife who has to worry about daily necessities?” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Don’t you think my dream is ridiculous and imaginative?”How could someone like her become a lawyer.
