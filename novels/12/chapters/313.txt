It could be seen from ye Sen’s eyes.

He had her in his heart.

“Li Yiyi continued, “The people that ye Sen cares about the most are his sister ye Shu and his niece. Fawning over him is only secondary. Thinking of ways to fawn over ye Shu and ye Shu’s daughter is the main thing.” ”

“Speaking up to this point, Li Yiyi paused, “As long as you get ye Shu’s approval and have her speak up for you in front of Ye Sen, then you don’t have to worry about anything! Ye Shu is a very easy to get along with woman. She’s quite simple. It’s not difficult to get her approval and like.” ”

Li Yiyi had heard ye Sen talk about ye Shu more than once before.

“At that time, Ye Sen was still a poor kid who had nothing. ”

“From his words, it could be heard that ye Sen respected ye Shu a lot! ”

“Every time they went out to eat, he would pack a bag for ye Shu. ”

“Even if Ye Sen was rich now, he would definitely not forget ye Shu. ”

“Therefore, Bai Wei had to please ye Shu! ”

“Bai Wei nodded. “Okay, I got it.” ”

“Usually, kind people would not have too many hearts. ”

Bai Wei could even coax those smelly men.

How could she not coax a housewife?

“”And there’s Ye Sen’s niece.”Li Yiyi continued, “That niece of his seems to be quite smart. You have to be more careful in front of her.” ”

“Hearing this, a disdainful smile appeared on the corner of Bai Wei’s mouth. “What does an eighteen or nineteen-year-old little girl know?” ”

Bai Wei really did not take ye Zao to heart.

She was already thirty years old.

Would she still fall into the hands of a little girl?

“Li Yiyi frowned. “In short, don’t let your guard down. Those who don’t seem to pose any threat are the most threatening!”Just like her back then. ”

It was precisely because she looked down on ye Sen.

Who would have thought that a poor kid with nothing would suddenly become the boss of a courier company?

Li Yiyi really regretted it.

“If she had not chosen to Dump Ye Sen back then, she would be ye Sen’s legitimate girlfriend now. ” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

How could Bai Wei still have the right to interfere?

“Bai Wei smiled and said, “Sister Yiyi, don’t worry. She’s just a little girl who hasn’t even dried her milk. There’s no need to take her to heart! I’ve been through hundreds of battles. What kind of stinky man have I Not Seen?” ”

“Thinking of Bai Wei’s experience and knowledge over the years, Li Yiyi did not say anything more and nodded, then she said, “Lanxiang, it’s good that you know what to do. In short, before you get the marriage certificate with Ye Sen, you can’t let anyone notice anything unusual!” ”

Bai Wei frowned. “What’s the point of getting the marriage certificate? Just get pregnant with his child! Don’t tell me that he doesn’t recognize his own flesh and blood?”

Ye Sen was already so old. He would definitely want to have a child of his own.

“Rather than waiting for the marriage certificate to be so troublesome, it would be better to take a leap into the sky. ”

Get pregnant with Ye Sen’s child.

“Who knew that once these words were said, Li Yiyi immediately rejected it. “No! You absolutely can not do that!” ”

“”Why?”Bai Wei looked at Li Yiyi, her eyes full of confusion. ”

“Li Yiyi continued, “Perhaps because of her sister’s influence, Ye Sen is a very conservative person. He is very opposed to living together before marriage. If you want to maintain the image of a good girl in front of him, you must not have too much intimate contact with him! Otherwise, all our previous efforts will be in vain!” ”

“Bai Wei looked at Li Yiyi in disbelief. “No Way, Sister Yiyi! During the years you were with him, did you not... ?” ”

Li Yiyi shook her head.

“Hearing this, Bai Wei sighed. “I didn’t expect ye Sen to be such a good man!”In today’s society, who could be as restrained as ye Sen? ”

This sentence of “Good Man”deeply hurt Li Yiyi’s heart.

This man used to belong to her.

Unfortunately.

He didn’t belong to her now.

“In the future, he would belong to Bai Wei. ”

“Thinking of this, Li Yiyi looked at Bai Wei. “Lanxiang, Congratulations. From now on, you’ll be the lady boss of Shengdong Express! Ye Sen will never betray you once you marry him!” ”

“Bai Wei could hear the hidden meaning in Li Yiyi’s words, “Sister Yiyi, you’re the Bole of my life. If it weren’t for you, I wouldn’t have met Ye Sen! Don’t worry, no matter what happens in the future, you’re still my sister! I Won’t let you drink soup if I get to eat meat!” ”

Bai Wei’s words came from the bottom of her heart.

There was no falsehood at all.

“After all, she and Li Yiyi were on the same boat. ”
