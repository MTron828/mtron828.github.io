Chapter 1186: 255: Zhao Xueyin fell into a trap and saw through her true colors. Si Lui was stunned! 2

Translator: 549690339

Si lui and Yang Wenhao were friends for more than ten years.

“He never thought that one day, he would be schemed against by his good friend.”

It was his fault.

It was all his fault for trusting others too easily.

“If it wasn’t for him, Zhao Xueyin wouldn’t have suffered so much.”

“Thinking of the scene of ye Zhuo being humiliated by Zhao Xueyin, Si lui almost couldn’t breathe.”

He would rather be the one being humiliated by Ye Zhuo.

He did not want Zhao Xueyin to suffer any grievance.

“Si lui raised his head and looked at Yang Wenhao, he enunciated each word clearly, “Don’t you know what you’ve done in your heart? Is there any point in pretending to be dumb? Yang Wenhao, I’ve Been Your Friend for more than ten years. You took the lead and set me up like this? You Don’t have to like Xue Yin, but why did you collude with Ye Zhuo to humiliate her?””

“Yang Wenhao did not understand a single word that si lui said. “Brother Yu, what’s wrong with you? Why Can’t I understand what you’re saying? Yes! I admit that I don’t like Zhao Xueyin, but when did I humiliate her?””

“”You can leave.”Si lui pointed at the exit. “From now on, we won’t interfere with each other’s business.””

“Yang Wenhao was so aggrieved that he could not speak. Si lui did not explain the reason, so he could not even explain. “I’m even more wronged than Dou E! Brother Yu, what’s wrong? Are you going to break up with me?””

“”Stop pretending!”Si lui continued, “Is it interesting?””

“Yang Wenhao couldn’t take it anymore, “Jin Ruyu! Are you sick? ! Ever since you got to know Zhao Xueyin, that green tea, your tone has turned tea-like! Can’t you just tell me what the problem is? You have to let me guess! You said that I humiliated Zhao Xueyin. Why would I humiliate her? If I wanted to humiliate her intentionally, would I have introduced her to Qian Jiu?””

“Who did you say was green tea?”The lawyer asked calmly.

“Yang Wenhao said directly, “Zhao Xueyin!””

Bang —

The lawyer raised his fist and threw a punch.

“Yang Wenhao’s head was knocked to the side, and he fell heavily to the ground.”

“Before Yang Wenhao could react, the lawyer grabbed his collar. “Yang Wenhao! I’m warning you, don’t insult Xueyin again. Otherwise, don’t blame me for being rude to you!””

Yang Wenhao did not expect Si Lu to attack him.

It was a lie to say that he was not disappointed.

“He had been friends with Si Lu for more than ten years, but he did not expect that he would end up in the hands of a woman.”

“Bah –”

“Yang Wenhao spat out a mouthful of blood. “I won’t admit to things that I didn’t do! I didn’t humiliate Zhao Xueyin, which means I didn’t humiliate her! Not to mention that I won’t humiliate her, Miss Ye is also disdainful of doing such things!””

“Idiot!”Si lui spat out two words coldly.

Yang Wenhao was an idiot.

A huge idiot.

“He kept calling ye Zao Miss Ye, but little did he know that in Ye Zao’s eyes, he was just a chess piece.”

“Now that Yang Wenhao was used by Ye Zao, he kept saying that ye Zao was good.”

Wasn’t he an idiot?

“In fact, in Si Lui’s memory, Yang Wenhao had always been quite smart.”

He didn’t know when he had become like this. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“”Who is the real idiot?”Yang Wenhao looked at Si Lui, the expression in his eyes was unclear. “The real idiot is you! If you mistake the fish eye for a pearl, you will regret it one day!””

Regret?

The one who should regret was Yang Wenhao.

“When he saw ye Zhuo’s true face in the future, he would definitely regret it too late.”

“But at that time, it would be too late for Yang Wenhao to regret it.”

Some things were lost.

He would never forgive Yang Wenhao!

Si lui let go of Yang Wenhao. “Get lost! I don’t want to See You Again!”

Yang Wenhao stood up from the ground and turned around to walk towards the entrance of the unit building.

“Si Lui’s voice came from the air again. “In the future, I won’t have a friend like you. If you still have face, don’t come to me in the name of a friend.””

Yang Wenhao should never have colluded with ye Zhuo to humiliate Zhao Xueyin.

He should not have acted as if nothing had happened after he insulted Zhao Xueyin.

Si lui hated this kind of people the most in his life.

“Hearing Si Lui’s voice, Yang Wenhao stopped in his tracks.”

He knew.

The friendship between him and Si Lui had come to an end.

Yang Wenhao pinched his fingers and took a deep breath.

“All sorts of memories of the past surfaced in his mind, and he felt very uncomfortable.”

The lawyer took out the key and opened the door.

He lived alone.

There was no smell of fireworks in the three-bedroom room.

“After changing his slippers, the lawyer went to the kitchen and took out a can of beer from the refrigerator. He opened the can with one hand and deleted Yang Wenhao from wechat with his phone in his other hand.”
