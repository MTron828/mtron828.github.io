“Chapter 2009: 420: Trash! Miss ye will always be here, and her faith will never end! 5”

Translator: 549690339

The ‘Ye’surname was a disgrace to her!

It reminded her all the time that she was a homeless orphan!

“If ye Zao really wanted her well-being, he should have helped her find her family and restore her surname. ”

But Ye Zao did not!

Ye Zao was a selfish and selfish villain!

“Hang it Up!”Ye Lan said angrily.

“Yes!”

“Immediately, an assistant brought a ladder and climbed up to pick the plaque. ”

“Those old subordinates who had followed ye Zao from the beginning all clenched their fists tightly, their eyes full of unwillingness. ”

“Wait!”Ye Lan said at this time.

“Chief.”The assistant walked to Ye Lan’s side respectfully.

“Ye Lan pointed at the nameplate beside her and said, “Pass this out and have each of them wear it properly.” ”

“Yes.”

“The assistant nodded, picked up the nameplate, and walked down the stage. ”

“When the crowd saw the nameplate, their already furious expressions became even more unsightly at this moment. ”

They saw that the new nameplate was designed with the surname ‘Qiu’.

“Qiu Yi he and fire were combined. The word ‘fire’was extended to a very long stroke, and everyone’s name was written on that stroke. ”

“”Everyone, from now on, all of you will be under Miss Qiu’s control. Hurry up and change your old nameplate! As a person, the most important thing is to judge the situation! “Everyone is an elite of the base. There are some things that I don’t need to say too much about, right?”Speaking up to this point.., ye Lan paused, then, she said, “The past is the past after all. As a person, you can’t always look back. You have to learn to look forward! “With all of your qualifications and abilities, after Lady Qiu takes the position of the female sovereign, she will definitely not treat all of you unfairly! “All of you still have a bright future ahead of you! “I can’t guarantee anything else, but I, Ye Lan, can guarantee that Lady Qiu will treat all of you better than ye Zao!” ”

What was ye Zao in front of Qiu Di?

These words caused everyone’s expressions to change.

Were they really going to betray ye Zao?

No!

No!

They couldn’t betray ye Zao.

“But if they didn’t betray ye Zao, were they going to leave the base? ”

“Qiu Di was going to be the female monarch of Chang Yue. If they really left the base, it would be the same as going against Qiu Di. In a while, would there still be a place for them to live in Chang Yue? ”

“Ye Lan was right. No matter how powerful ye Zao was, it was only the past. ”

One had to learn to look forward.

Ye Zao’s era was no longer there. The current era belonged to Ye Zao.

“He couldn’t destroy his own life for the sake of his so-called belief, right? ”

Zuo Xiao Shan hesitated for a long time before finally choosing to pin the nameplate with ‘Qiu’on her chest.

“As for the old nameplate, he directly threw it on the ground. ”

“There was always a first, there would always be a second, and then a third... ”

Seeing everyone compromise one after another...

“Old Dai, who was lying on the ground, almost cried like rain. ”

Miss Ye!

Miss Ye!

Quickly open your eyes and take a look.

“Bah!”

“At this moment, one of the youths directly picked up the nameplate and fiercely smashed it onto the ground, “Who does the autumn flute count as! ! What right does the autumn flute have to take over Miss Ye’s base! ! Ye Lan, let me tell you, there’s rain in the sky and goods in the people! The Heavenly Dao has reincarnation. Just Wait, you and the autumn flute will get your retribution sooner or later!” ”

The Crystal nameplate was smashed into pieces on the ground.

“Zi Yue! Good job!”Old Dai lay on the ground and said loudly.

“Ye Lan narrowed her eyes and looked at the youth. “Good! You have backbone! Li Zi Yue, you really have backbone! Let me tell you, you better not regret it!” ”

“Regret?”Li Zi Yue smiled at Ye Lan. “This young master has never known regret in my entire life!” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Only betraying ye Zhuo would make him regret it!

“After saying that, Li Zi Yue walked to Old Dai’s side and helped him up. “Uncle Dai, are you alright?” ”

“I won’t Die!”Old Dai waved his hand. “I haven’t seen the person who betrayed Miss Ye get retribution! How can I be in the lead? !”

Li Ziyue took out a black pill from the first-aid kit and fed it to his head.

“”F * ck! I’m not doing it anymore!”At this moment, a middle-aged man with a strong build also threw away the nameplate in his hand. “I’ve long disliked that little girl, Qiu Di! What right does she have to stand here and Shout! It’s disgusting!” ”

PA —

“In the crowd, more and more people threw the new nameplate on the ground. ”

“Li Zi Yue took the opportunity to stand in front of the crowd and shouted, “Everyone, listen to me! Miss ye will definitely not be easily killed by others! She will definitely come back! Miss ye will always be here, and her faith will never end.” ”

“With these words, everyone became even more excited. They raised their right hands high. “Miss Ye will always be here, and her faith will never end!” ”

The entire scene could not be controlled for a moment.

Their blood boiled.

Ye Lan looked at these people coldly.

Just wait.

They would regret it soon.

Miss Ye will always be here?

Hur!

In your dreams!

“At this point in time, you still expect ye Zao to save them? ”

Ye Zao had long become a pile of dirt.

Pathetic.

Ridiculous.

Pathetic.

“”Leng Ye,”ye Lan turned around and looked at the people beside her. ”

“”Yes,”Leng ye said. ”

Ye Lan narrowed her eyes. “Close the door. Don’t leave anyone alive!”

Those who betrayed the autumn flute didn’t have the right to live in this world.

The person who would be in charge of the Changyue kingdom was the autumn flute. Who would care about the life and death of these people?

Bang Bang Bang Bang

All the doors were closed at this moment.

“However, Leng Ye was still standing beside Ye Lan. ”

Ye Lan frowned.

What’s going on?

Leng ye clearly didn’t move. How did this door close?

Someone came in!

Who Was It?

It seemed like they didn’t come with good intentions!

Could it be ye Zao’s old subordinates?

Leng ye also entered a state of vigilance.

The others at the side looked at each other and saw confusion in each other’s eyes.

“Who are you?”Leng ye narrowed his eyes. “How dare you act so presumptuously in front of Chief Ye!”

A chuckle came from the air. “Chief Ye?”

“Hearing this, everyone looked toward the source of the voice. ”

They saw a slim and tall figure walking toward them step by step.

The person was dressed in black and wore black pants. He was wearing a pair of black military boots that reached his knees. He had a cap on his head that covered his eyes and eyebrows. His face was a little hard to see. A powerful and intimidating aura erupted from his body.

She shuddered!

“Although her face could not be seen, this figure was extremely familiar to ye Lan. ”

“Ye Lan’s pupils constricted abruptly. Her eyes were filled with horror, and her back was drenched in cold sweat. ”

It was her!

She was back!

“Ye Lan’s footsteps were unsteady, and she took a few steps back. Her face was as white as paper. ”

She walked step by step to the chief stage. The crowd below the stage automatically made way for her.

“Miss Ye!”Someone shouted in the crowd.
