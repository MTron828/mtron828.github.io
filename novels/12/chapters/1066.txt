Zhao Xueyin looked at the lawyer and nodded seriously.

...

Three days passed in the blink of an eye.

Zhao Pingting was officially discharged from the hospital.

Ye Zhuo and an Lizi came to fetch Zhao pingting out of the hospital. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Ye Zhuo handed the flowers in his hand to Zhao Pingting. “Pingting, Congratulations on being discharged!” ”

“”Thank you!”Zhao Pingting took the flowers and hugged ye Zhuo. She whispered in her ear, “Zhuozhuo, thank you. You gave me two chances to be reborn.” ”

“If it wasn’t for ye Zao, she would probably be a pile of ashes by now. ”

“Whenever she saw ye Zao, her life would be filled with light and brightness! ”

“Unknowingly, Ye Zao had become the guiding light in her life. ”

“Ye Zao patted Zhao Pingting’s back. “The three of us are friends, best friends.”In her previous life, Ye Zao was busy with scientific research and had never made a true friend. While Zhao Pingting thanked her, she also thanked Zhao Pingting, she was also very grateful to Zhao Pingting. ”

“Okay.”Zhao pingting nodded.

“A moment later, Zhao Pingting let go of Ye Zao and hugged an Lizi. ”

“An lizi smiled and said, “Okay, okay, stop being so pretentious! Have you packed your things?” ”

Zhao Pingting sniffled. “My mom and the others were almost done packing last night.”

“An lizi continued to ask, “Are you really going back to Yunjing? Aren’t you going to stay in the capital for a few more days?” ”

“As the winter vacation was about to begin, Zhao Pingting decided to apply for leave from school and study at home. She would come back to school after the winter vacation. She could take advantage of this period of time to get along with her family. ”

“Zhao Pingting shook her head, “I’ve already talked to the school counselor and bought the plane tickets! We’ll see each other again when school starts! Don’t worry, when we get to yunjing, I’ll send out more home videos and photos to ease your homesickness.” ”

“”Okay!”An lizi continued, “We might go back to Yunjing for the New Year this year, and we’ll visit you at Your House!” ”

“Mother Zhao and Zhao Yingjun walked in from outside. “The formalities have been settled. Pingting, let’s go.” ”

“Okay.”Zhao pingting nodded.

Mother Zhao and Zhao Yingjun carried their things and walked out.

Ye Zhuo went to the parking lot in advance to drive.

“Because there were quite a lot of people in the past few days, ye Zao drove the Lincoln Limousine. ”

“Lin Jincheng originally wanted the driver to follow them, but ye Zao felt that the driver was troublesome, so he didn’t let the driver follow them. ”

“When Zhao Pingting and the others arrived at the hospital, the car was already parked in front of them. ”

“Mother Zhao said very embarrassedly, “Zao Zao, Pingting has already troubled you and Lizi for the past few days. Why would she trouble you to send us to the airport?” ”

“”Aunty, Ping Ting and we are best friends. You are being too polite!”Ye Zha said. ”

“An Lizi nodded with a smile. “Aunty, Zha Zha Zha is right! Hurry up and get on the car! The traffic in the capital is heavy. Don’t miss your flight later!” ”

Zhao Yingjun’s mother then got into the car.

“It was Zhao Yingjun’s first time sitting in such a luxurious car. He felt that it was very novel. He looked at Ye Zha and said in embarrassment, “Zha Zha Zha, can I take a few photos?” ”

All men liked cars.

Zhao Yingjun was no exception.

“”Yes,”ye Zao continued, “By the way, there is a switch next to the left seat. That is the switch for the car refrigerator. There are fruits and drinks in the refrigerator.” ”

An Lizi immediately demonstrated to Zhao Yingjun.

Zhao Yingjun was very surprised. He had never known about the car refrigerator before. It seemed that luxury cars were different. He immediately took photos with his phone.

“”Oh right, brother Yingjun, there’s a blanket over here.”An Lizi opened the locker in the middle. ”

“Within a few minutes, Zhao Yingjun had a rough idea of the interior structure of the car. ”

“However, what surprised Zhao Yingjun even more was ye Zao’s driving skills. ”

“It was common knowledge that super-long cars were difficult to control, so they would slow down when turning and overtaking. ”

“But on the way, not only did ye Zao not slow down, he was speeding instead. He was extremely agile! ”

“If they had not seen it with their own eyes, who would believe that a little girl would have such good driving skills? ”

She could actually drive the extended Lincoln so well!

Even an experienced driver like Zhao Yingjun would not be able to do it.

“Half an hour later, the car stopped at the parking garage at the bottom of the airport. ”

Ye Zhuo and an Lizi got out of the car and sent Zhao Pingting and the others to the boarding gate.

“Ye Zhuo said, “Auntie, brother Yingjun, Pingting, I wish you a safe journey! Pingting, don’t forget to send a message to Lizi and me to tell us that you’re safe when you get home!” ”

“Zhao pingting smiled and said, “Don’t worry! I Won’t forget.” ”
