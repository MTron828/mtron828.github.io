“Chapter 668: 152: the truth has been pushed aside, the secret of the health soup, Old Lady Lin regrets it! 6”

Translator: 549690339

She did not think that Old Lady Lin would suddenly attack her.

After so many years.

Old Lady Lin did not even say a harsh word to her.

But this time.

Old Lady Lin actually gave her a slap.

Could it be that she was really going to Lose Old Lady Lin’s trust in her?

Would everything that she had spent nineteen years on collapse overnight?

This slap was simply exhilarating.

One did not need to think to know how much Old Lady Lin regretted her previous actions.

“Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly, he continued, “Because she wants you to become dependent on her, so that you can not leave her. She wants you to become a marionette in her hands. She wants to use your trust in her to successfully marry into the Lin family! Then, she wants to use your relationship with Granny Cen to marry Feng Xianxian into the Cen family. When that happens, the mother and daughter will be able to control the entire capital.” ”

It was only at this moment.

Old Madam Lin finally came to her senses. Just how muddle-headed was she.

Regret!

She really regretted it!

She regretted inviting a wolf into the house.

She regretted even more that she had treated a wolf as her own daughter-in-law for so many years.

Old Mrs. Lin slapped Feng Qianhua’s face again. “B * Tch! You’re a B * Tch!”

“After the slap, Old Mrs. Lin could not hold on any longer and fell backward. ”

“Fortunately, there were servants supporting her from behind. ”

How could Feng Qianhua not regret it?

All she regretted now was that she did not directly kill that little b * Tch ye Zao back then! She should not have fed ye Zao piperazine. She should have fed ye Zao poison directly!

If ye Zao died!

How could such a thing happen again?

“If time was reversed, she would have poisoned ye Zao without hesitation. ”

Ye Zao would never have the chance to speak!

“At this moment, Lin Jincheng stood up and said, “Mom, Feng Qianhua, Aunt Zhang, and Xu Lanying have done all kinds of bad things. Our family of four, including you, are all victims. Now that the witnesses and evidence are all here, let’s call the police.” ”

“If it wasn’t for the fact that he had to pay with his life, Lin Jincheng would have even wanted to kill someone! ”

But he couldn’t do anything about it.

“He had a wife, a son, and a daughter now. He couldn’t dirty his hands because of Feng Qianhua. ”

The law would always be in place.

He believed that the law would punish Feng Qianhua severely.

“”Call the police! Yes, call the police!”Old Mrs. Lin subconsciously wanted to call Aunt Zhang, but she immediately changed her words. “Xiao Lan! Call the police! Call the police!” ”

Call the police?

“Hearing this, Feng Qianhua panicked. ”

No!

She couldn’t go to jail.

She still wanted to marry Lin Jincheng!

She still wanted to become the mistress of the Lin family.

“Feng Qianhua hugged old Mrs. Lin’s thigh tightly and cried, “Aunt Lin, I’m sorry. I know I was wrong. Please forgive me! I’m willing to be your slave to repay you! I beg you, please forgive me this time!” ”

“Get lost! B * Tch! Get lost!”Old Mrs. Lin kicked Feng Qianhua away. “You’re a beast worse than a pig or a dog! You Don’t have the right to call me Aunt Lin!”

“Old Mrs. Lin had been confused for thirty years. Now that the clouds had cleared and the Sun had come out, she would no longer believe Feng Qianhua’s flowery words! ”

Feng Qianhua was kicked to the ground like a deflated rubber ball. She looked at the grayish-white patch like a dead tree.

Was her life really over just like that?

She couldn’t accept it!

She really couldn’t accept it!

“Soon, police sirens sounded outside the door. ”

“Feng Qianhua wanted to escape, but there was nowhere for her to run now. ”

A group of police officers came in one after another. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Just like that, they controlled Feng Qianhua, Aunt Zhang, and Xu Lanyue. Three cold handcuffs were handcuffed to their hands. ”

“Feng Qianhua never expected that one day, she would become a prisoner. ”

This was a great humiliation for her!

It was worse than death.

“As the victims, Old Madam Lin and Lin Jincheng’s family of four also brought the evidence to the police station. ”

It was not until an hour later that the five of them walked out of the police station.

“Facing Lin Jincheng’s family of four, old madam Lin felt both guilty and regretful. “Jincheng, Ah Shu, and Zao Zao, I, I have let you guys down. For the sake of an ingrate, I actually treated you guys like that earlier...” ”

Especially ye Shu and Ye Zhongruo.

Old Lady Lin had never treated ye Shu and ye Zhongruo as daughter-in-law and granddaughter-in-law before.

“In her heart, only Feng Qianhua and Feng Xianxian were her granddaughter. ”

She was regretting it now!

“Old Lady Lin grabbed ye Shu’s hand. “Ah Shu, zhongruo, can you all forgive me?” ”

“Ye Shu just looked at Old Lady Lin, her expression unclear. ”

Nineteen years.

“Because of Old Lady Lin, she and her own daughter had suffered for so many years. ”

Some hardships and some injuries could not be erased by time.

“Moreover, after returning to the Lin family, Old Lady Lin had done so many heart-chilling things. ”

“At this moment, facing Old Lady Lin, she simply could not say the word ‘forgive’. ”

Nor could she forgive.

“Seeing ye Shu like this, Old Lady Lin looked at ye Zao again. “Zao Zao, are you... are you willing to forgive Grandma...” ”

Ye Zao’s eyes remained the same. “Let me ask you a question.”

“You ask.”Old Lady Lin nodded.

“Ye Zao continued, “If I did not bring out so much strong evidence today and only told you what Feng Qianhua had done all these years, would you believe me?” ”

When she said this.

Old Madam Lin was stunned.

Because she didn’t know either.

Although she didn’t want to admit it.

She still didn’t believe the answer in her heart.

“After all, Feng Qianhua had been with her for so long. ”

She had never known that she had raised a wolf.

“I...”

“Ye Zhuo smiled slightly. “Alright, I think I should know your answer.” ”

“At that moment, Old Mrs. Lin felt as if she had lost something important. ”

“Old Mrs. Lin opened her mouth, ready to say something. ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “You’ve drunk Feng Qianhua’s health-preserving soup for 19 years. It’s better for you to go to the hospital for a check-up.” ”

“Lin Jincheng turned to look at the driver. “Xiao Li, take old Mrs. Lin to the hospital. We’ll take a taxi back.” ”

Lin Jincheng had no intention of accompanying Old Lady Lin to the hospital.

“Although Old Lady Lin had also been deceived by Feng Qianhua, Lin Jincheng could not sympathize with her at all. ”

There was nothing to sympathize with people who had suffered the consequences of their own actions.

“Hearing this, Old Lady Lin’s eyes turned even redder. She turned to look at Xiao Li and tried her best to suppress the sadness in her heart. “Xiao Li, let’s go.” ”

Xiao Li nodded and opened the backseat door for Old Mrs. Lin.

...

It was already afternoon when Feng Xianxian learned that Feng Qianhua was in prison.

“The police station temporarily prevented her from seeing Feng Qianhua. She did not know what had happened, so she could only go to the Lin family to look for old Mrs. Lin. ”

The Feng family did not have much power in the capital.

So Feng Xianxian could only go to look for old Mrs. Lin.

“Old Lady Lin treated Feng Qianhua so well, she would definitely not sit by and do nothing. ”

“After learning that Old Lady Lin was in the hospital, Feng Xianxian rushed to the hospital. ”

“When she arrived, Old Lady Lin was lying on the hospital bed. Her face was pale and her mental state looked a little bad. Feng Xianxian immediately pounced over and asked with concern, “Grandma, What’s Wrong? What’s wrong with you?” ”
