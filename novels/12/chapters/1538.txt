“”Zha Zha Zha, help me answer the phone,”Cen Shaoqing said.”

“Okay.”

“Ye Zha subconsciously searched his waist for a pocket, but after searching for a long time, he still could not find the pocket. His hand could only go down, left, and right. In the end, he actually touched something that he should not have touched. Ye Zha let go of his hand as if he was electrocuted.”

“Why don’t you have a pocket on you!”

Cen Shaoqing’s eyes contained a faint smile. “The phone is on the table.”

Ye Zao was a little embarrassed. “Why didn’t you say so earlier!”

“You didn’t ask.” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“I think you did it on purpose.”Ye Zao picked up the phone. “There’s no phone number. Should I give it to you?”

“Just say that I’m busy.”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly and slid to answer the call. “Hello.”

“The person on the other end of the phone did not know if he heard ye Zhuo’s voice, so he hurriedly hung up the phone.”

Ye Zhuo frowned slightly.

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “What’s Wrong?””

“”He hung up the phone.”Ye Zhuo asked, “Do you want to call and ask?””

“”No need.”Cen Shaoqing focused on fixing the lamp. “If there’s anything, I’ll call again.””

“Ye Zhuo nodded slightly,”

in the kitchen.

“Seeing that little du had returned so quickly, ye Langhua asked curiously, “Little Du, did you take the Chen Pi that I asked you to take?””

“Little Du’s heart was still beating a little fast. He shook his head and said, “No.””

“Ye Langhua asked with some doubt, “If I didn’t, why did you come back so quickly?””

“Little du continued, “Aunt Lang, why don’t you stop making Chen Pi Tea!””

“Why?”Ye Langhua asked.

“Xiao du looked at the courtyard in front of him. “Well, Miss Ye and master Wu are in front.””

“What does it have to do with you taking Chen Pi?”

“Well... it’s just that...”Xiao du didn’t know how to say it.

“Seeing Xiao du like this, ye Langhua could probably guess what had happened. She turned her head to look at the front room and saw that the lights in the room had all been turned off, she smiled and said, “Then let’s make Chrysanthemum Tea! Drinking mutton soup is easy to cause a fire. It just so happens that drinking chrysanthemum will cause a fire!””

Little du nodded. “Then I’ll go get Chrysanthemum.”

“Go ahead.”

On the other side.

At a luxurious club in Beijing.

“After spending an entire afternoon, an Lizi finally finished setting up the private room.”

“She had really put in a lot of effort. The interior was decorated very warmly. At the same time, she had also called some roommates to celebrate Zhang Qingqing’s birthday. She had originally planned to call ye Zhuo, but ye Zhuo had gone to visit ye Langhua today, therefore, she did not call ye Zao.”

“At 10 o’clock in the evening, Zhang Qingqing was the first to arrive at the clubhouse. Once she entered the private room, she was extremely touched. She covered her mouth and said, “Lizi, thank you!””

“What silly words! This is what I should do.”An Lizi walked to Zhang Qingqing’s side.

Zhang Qingqing hugged an Lizi and wept emotionally.

“”Silly, why are you crying!”An Lizi said with a smile.”

“Zhang Qingqing really wanted to say that she was crying because of an Lizi’s stupidity. “Lizi, I’m really touched!””

“An Lizi continued, “Alright, Alright, it’s nothing! Oh right, let me introduce you. These are my roommates. Rong Yin, Hua Xian, and this is Ouyang Qian. Yin Yin, Xian Xian, and Ouyang. This is my childhood friend, Zhang Qingqing, who grew up with me. You can call her Qingqing.””

“Looking at an Lizi’s three roommates, Qingqing Zhang was a little speechless, but she still pretended to be very happy to greet them.”

On purpose.

An Lizi definitely did it on purpose.

“She asked an Lizi to bring some friends to celebrate her birthday, and an Lizi brought three roommates.”

“An Lizi’s meaning was very obvious, she didn’t want to give herself any chance to marry into a rich family.”

Hur.

Did an lizi really think that this would stop her from marrying into a wealthy family?

What a joke!

Just wait and see.

“She would soon become an Lizi’s younger sister-in-law, the young mistress of the Lin family. Thinking of this, Zhang Qingqing narrowed her eyes. A faint light flashed through her eyes and disappeared in a flash. She smiled and said, “Thank you for coming to celebrate my birthday. Thank you!””

“You’re welcome.”Ouyang Qian was the most neurotic of the three roommates. “Lizi’s friends are our friends!”

“Rong Yin said with a smile, “Ouyang is right. You Don’t have to be so polite with us.””

An Lizi treated everyone well and got along very well with her roommates.

“The few of them were chatting when the sound of footsteps came from outside the door again. An Lizi looked up and saw that it was dog two, fat tiger, and the others. She said in surprise, “Dog two, why are you here too!””

“Knowing what Zhang Qingqing was thinking, an Lizi didn’t inform Lin Ze. She didn’t expect dog two and the others to come.”
