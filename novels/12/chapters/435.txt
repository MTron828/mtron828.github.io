“Chapter 436: 122: Big Burning’s domineering entrance, slapping Feng Xianxian in the face! 4”

Translator: 549690339

There was not even a ripple on ye Zhuo’s face. He was extremely calm.

Bai Xiaoman even suspected that ye Zhuo’s ears were not working properly!

“Otherwise, how could he be so calm? ”

“Under normal circumstances, shouldn’t ordinary people scream when they saw a wealthy and noble family? ”

Bai Xiaoman was a little disappointed that she did not see a very surprised expression on ye Zhuo’s face.

Such an ignorant country bumpkin!

He did not even know about the Lin family.

“Bai Xiaoman continued, “It’s normal that you foreigners don’t know about the Lin family.” ”

“After all, the communication information in a godforsaken place was not well-developed. ”

It was obvious that ye Zao must have come from the countryside.

“After saying that.., bai Xiaoman continued, “But I can give you some information. You should all know about the brand of Hua Pu, right? Hua Pu is the Lin family’s family business! However, Hua Pu is only one of the Lin family’s businesses. Hua Pu also has brands like Summer Flower, Pale Moon, and Merrill Lynch.” ”

Hua Pu was the top brand in the domestic household industry.

Seventy percent of the household goods in China came from Hua Pu.

There was no one in China who did not know about Hua Pu.

“Hearing this, Li Yueyue said in surprise, “Really?” ”

“Seeing Li Yueyue like this, Bai Xiaoman nodded her head in satisfaction. That proud look of hers was as if she was the real daughter of the Lin family. “Of course it’s true! That’s the Lin family. Don’t tell me that anyone would dare to impersonate the Lin family’s daughter!” ”

Ye Zhuo’s tone was indifferent. “OH.”

Oh?

Bai Xiaoman frowned.

Why was this new roommate’s reaction so calm?

Did she even know what the Lin family’s eldest daughter meant?

Country Bumpkin!

She had never seen the market before.

“Feng Xianxian was also stunned. She was the Lin family’s eldest daughter. No matter where she went, she would always be praised by others. ”

This was the first time she had seen such a person with no discerning eyes.

“Feng Xianxian raised her head to look at ye Zao, her eyes sizing him up. With this look, she was completely stunned. ”

She originally thought that ye Zao was a very ordinary country girl.

She did not expect that ye Zao was actually so beautiful!

Feng Xianxian saw a sense of crisis on ye Zao.

“Although Feng Xianxian was usually very pretentious, in front of ye Zao, she had to admit that ye Zao was more beautiful than her. ”

Feng Xianxian’s gaze turned to the logo on ye Zao’s clothes.

From head to toe.

Not a single piece of clothing was a big brand.

They were all miscellaneous brands that she had never seen before!

They were probably just street goods. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

She then turned her head to look at Ye Zao’s table.

On the huge table.

Other than a few books and a computer.

There wasn’t even the most basic skincare set!

Just how poor was she to not be able to afford a set of skincare products?

“Moreover, the military training was about to begin. ”

She didn’t even prepare sunscreen.

The most valuable thing on the table was that broken computer.

“However, that computer was really too broken! ”

It was even shabbier than second-hand goods.

It didn’t matter what she wanted!

How could such a beautiful skin bag grow on the face of such a lowly person?

Feng Xianxian instantly felt nauseous as if she had eaten a fly.

“If this skin grew on her face, how great would that be! ”

“Feng Xianxian suppressed the disdain in her heart and looked at Ye Zhuo. She took the initiative to speak, “I’m Feng Xianxian, the Feng beside two o’clock water. I’m a person from the capital, a finance major.” ”

“”I’m Ye Zhuo,”ye Zhuo said very politely. “My mouth is made of wood leaves, and it’s burning with brilliance. I’m from Yun Capital, and I’m also a chemistry major in pharmaceutical chemistry.” ”

Yun Jing was just a small place.

Even a hundred Yun Jing schools could not compare to the capital.

Feng Xianxian’s eyes flashed with a mocking look.

So she was from Yun Jing. No wonder she was dressed like a street vendor.

“Li Yueyue said excitedly, “Ye Zao, then we are in the same major!” ”

Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“After saying that, Li Yueyue looked at Feng xianxian and asked curiously, “Didn’t Xiao Man say that you are the eldest daughter of the Lin Family? Then why is your surname Feng?” ”

“Feng Xianxian smiled and said, “I’m surnamed Feng with my mother.” ”

“I see.”Li Yueyue came to a sudden realization.

“Bai Xiaoman looked at Li Yueyue and ye Zhuo and said, “Let’s talk about our family conditions now! My father opened a company in Beijing and has three apartments at home! What about the two of you?” ”

“Ye Zhuo said, “My mother is a caterer. Her family conditions are average.” ”

Catering?

Her family conditions are average?

Bai Xiaoman and Feng Xianxian’s eyes flashed with ridicule.

Then her mom must be working as a waiter in a restaurant!

“What About Your Dad?”Bai Xiaoman continued.

“I don’t have a dad.”Ye Zao’s expression remained the same. “But I have an uncle.”
