“David nodded and said with satisfaction, “Miss Tang, as long as you successfully complete this task, Dr. Cara will definitely treat you well.” ”

“Tang Xue looked at David and said with a smile, “Assistant David, don’t worry. Just give me five minutes.” ”

Wasn’t it just bringing a bomb in?

Everyone in the base was thinking about how to curry favor with Tang Xue.

It was simply too easy for Tang Xue to do something!

“”Okay,”David said with satisfaction. “Then I’ll wait for Miss Tang here.” ”

“Okay.”

Tang Xue turned around and walked out.

David looked at Tang Xue’s back with a sarcastic look in his eyes.

Chinese people were all idiots.

They didn’t even know that they were being used.

Especially this Tang Xue.

“For the sake of a C nation, she would even betray her own countrymen. ”

How pathetic!

“With the existence of someone like Tang Xue, it was inevitable that China’s technology industry would be destroyed. ” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

On the other side.

On the aircraft carrier.

“After ye Zhuo and the others entered the aircraft carrier cabin, the silver staircase automatically retracted. ”

The nearly 120-meter staircase disappeared into the air in less than three minutes.

It was as if nothing had ever happened.

The people on the ground watched the changes in the aircraft carrier in the air with shock in their eyes.

This kind of shock could only be understood by those who had experienced it firsthand.

The shock could not be seen through the screen at all.

[ why does it look like a special effect to me? ]

[ it looks like a special effect plus one! ]

[ does anyone in the audience want to explain? ]

“[ I’ve seen it. Although it’s not special effects, it doesn’t have any high-tech content. It’s just a gimmick used to impress the audience! ] ”

“[ does YC really think that the aircraft carrier project will be announced as a success just like that? An ignorant fool. She’s stupid herself, yet she still wants to treat others as idiots. ] ”

“[ the Chinese love this! Putting on an Act! It’s so fake! Especially this YC. At a time like this, I really don’t know how she can put on an act. Doesn’t she feel embarrassed in front of so many heads of State? ] ”

“[ YC, get out of the technology world! Don’t embarrass yourself! I feel awkward just looking at you. ] ”

“[ if this trash aircraft carrier self-destructs in the air later, it’ll be hilarious! ] ”

“[ what the person above said makes a lot of sense. If a missile or something came at this time, it would be able to teach YC how to behave. ] ”

“[ sigh, although I’m also Chinese, I also feel quite embarrassed. ]. I clearly know that this aircraft carrier is impossible to exceed the speed of light, but I don’t know what I’m expecting. ]. Actually, it wouldn’t be a big deal if YC announced the failure of the aircraft carrier plan openly. After all, no country has yet developed an aircraft that can surpass the speed of light... ... .. ”

“[ the person above is right. In fact, this matter was nothing in the beginning. If YC didn’t seek death herself, she wouldn’t have died. She was the one who bragged, and she signed the betting agreement herself. Who can she blame? ] ”

[ don’t be so pessimistic. What if Dr. YC succeeds? At least Dr. YC didn’t run away. She really built an aircraft carrier! Have you ever seen such an aircraft carrier before? ]

[ the person above is crazy! He actually believes that YC’s aircraft carrier can exceed the speed of light. ]

“[ Haha, I’m Dying of Laughter! ] ”

“At the same time, on the other side. ”

“Ye Sen was sitting in front of his computer, watching the aircraft carrier launch ceremony. ”

“Because he believed in ye Zao, he was not nervous at all. ”

“He was not nervous, but when he saw so many people scolding ye Zao on the bullet screen, Ye Sen was very angry and immediately started scolding people on the internet. ”

“Although ye Zao had many fans and the protection of the NIU Hulu family, this live broadcast was an international live broadcast. He was facing a global audience. ”

“Even though ye Sen had the help of the Niu Hulu family, he was still outnumbered when facing a global audience. ”

“At this moment, Ye Sen seemed to have thought of something. He immediately put down the keyboard, took out his cell phone, and made a call. ”

“”Hello, is this old Xu?” ”

“”It’s me.”Old Xu’s voice came from the other side. “Director Ye, is there something you need me for?” ”

“Ye Sen continued, “Old Xu, I remember you saved a batch of diamonds before, right?” ”

“Yes.”

“Ye Sen said, “Old Xu, listen to me. Dr. YC’s aircraft carrier will be launching today. The first stop of the aircraft carrier will be Neptune. There are large quantities of diamonds on Neptune. Dr. YC will bring back a bunch of diamonds soon and realize the freedom of all diamonds! “Hurry up and sell the diamonds in your storage. Otherwise, you will suffer a huge loss!” ”

“Lao Xu laughed out loud. “Ye, do you really think that the aircraft carrier plan will work?” ”
