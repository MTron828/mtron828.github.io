“Aunt Lang said, “Since Little Half Moon isn’t interested in the position of heir, let Weiyue come! Little Half Moon is right, the rich water shouldn’t flow to outsiders.” ”

“Hearing this, Xi Weiyue creased her brows without a trace. ”

So she was only qualified to ask for things that others didn’t want!

This damned old woman.

“Fortunately, she was already prepared and found Jiang Yan to pretend to be Little Half Moon. ”

“If this damn old woman really found half a month, then would she still have the position of Grandfather Ye’s successor? ”

Just wait!

“When she had a firm foothold in the financial world, she would definitely let this old woman get what she deserved! ”

“Xi Weiyue looked up at Aunt Lang, then, she said, “Aunt Lang, don’t worry. I Won’t hold on to grandfather’s position and not let go. As long as sister half a month wants to go to the financial world, then I can return the position of successor to her at any time.” ”

“”Okay.”Aunt Lang nodded and continued, “Prepare yourself. If nothing unexpected happens, someone from the Shunxi Financial Group will come tomorrow.” ”

“”En.”Xi Weiyue Ann held back the excitement in her heart. “Aunt, thank you.” ”

“”Weiyue, you’ve grown up with your own eyes. There’s no need to be so formal with aunt.” ”

Xi Weiyue was moved as she hugged Aunt Lang.

Aunty Lang patted her back.

“From an angle that Aunty Lang could not see, Xi Weiyue and Jiang Yan looked at each other and saw the scheming look in each other’s eyes. ”

“Walking out of the study room, Aunty Lang looked at Jiang Yan. “Little Half Moon, Let’s go pack our things.” ”

“”Pack our things?”Jiang Yan said, “Mom, are we going on a long trip?” ”

“Auntie Lang said, “We’ve Disturbed Your Auntie and the others for a long time. It’s time for us to leave.” ”

Leave?

“She had only lived for a few days as the daughter of a wealthy family, and now she was being asked to leave? ”

Jiang Yan didn’t want to leave!

“The XI family had maids and chefs, and there was even a chauffeur to pick her up. Everyone respectfully called her miss. ”

Only a fool would leave!

“Jiang Yan frowned slightly, “Mom, I don’t want to leave. I want to be with Dad and the others... “This is also our home. Why do we have to leave “It wasn’t easy for dad to find me. I don’t want to leave dad, and I don’t want to leave you either. Please don’t leave, Okay?” ” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Jiang Yan was on the verge of tears.

Auntie Lang sighed when she saw Jiang Yan like this. “But this isn’t our home after all.”

“”Sister, look at what you’re saying! If outsiders hear this, they’ll think that I’m mistreating you and Your Daughter!”Yang Jiao walked over from behind, “Sister, if we’re talking about master, you and Little Half Moon are the real masters of this family. We’re the real outsiders! “Since Little Half Moon doesn’t want to leave, why are you making things difficult for the child? ! “This child has just found her parents. It’s only natural that she doesn’t want to leave! “Sister, you’ve experienced the pain of losing your daughter, so you should know what it’s like to have your own flesh and blood separated. Now that old MU has only found her for half a month, let alone half a month, even old mu can’t bear to part with her!” ”

“Although ye Langhua had given the position of heir to the Shunxi Financial Group to XI Weiyue, she still had a gold mine map in her hands! ”

“As long as she got that gold mine map, Ye Langhua, this damn old hag, would go wherever she wanted to go! ”

She would not say another word!

“But now, the gold mine map was still tightly held in ye Langhua’s hands. ”

Ye Langhua wanted to leave?

No Way!

“Yang Jiao’s words were reasonable. Aunt Lang turned to look at Jiang Yan. “Little Half Moon, you don’t want to leave your father?” ”

“Jiang Yan nodded hurriedly, “Not only do I miss my father, I also Miss Auntie and Weiyue. If it wasn’t for Auntie and sister Weiyue who brought me back from the relief station, I would still be suffering in the relief station! “I want to spend more time with them! “Mom, let’s not leave, okay?” ”

“Yang jiao echoed, “Since the child has said so, sister, don’t leave! Stay at home as long as you want!” ”

“Auntie Lang hesitated for a moment. “Alright then, Yang Jiao, thank you.” ”

“Yang jiao smiled and said, “Sister, why do you like to Talk Like This! If you continue to do this, I’ll be angry!” ”

“Jiang Yan held Yang Jiao’s hand. “Auntie, you’re such a good person!” ”

On the other side.

Cao Wei and elder Zhang came to Beijing University.

“After asking around, they finally found ye Zhuo’s counselor. ”

“The counselor’s surname was Jia, and she was in her fifties this year. “May I ask what is your relationship with student ye Zhuo?” ”

Ye Zhuo’s identity was not simple.

“Although she was still a student in school, she was also a doctor in the science and Technology field. ”

She has her own field in medicine.
