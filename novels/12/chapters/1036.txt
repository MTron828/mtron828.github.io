“Half a month was very attached to Xi Muwen as a father. Every Time XI Muwen came back in the middle of the night, no matter how busy he was, he would hug her for half a month. ”

“Perhaps even half a month herself did not expect that one day, the father who loved her the most would lay his hands on her. ”

She was still so young.

She was only three years old.

“Every time she thought about the suffering that half a month had gone through all these years, ye Langhua could not control herself. ”

“”Ha...”ye Langhua sneered. “Sad? If you were sad, you wouldn’t have laid a hand on your own daughter! Xi Muwen, are you still human? !” ”

“Xi Muwen’s brows twitched. “Langhua, I don’t understand what you’re talking about!” ”

“Ye Langhua looked at Xi Muwen. “Let me ask you, where were you when you went missing half a month ago?” ”

“Xi muwen replied, “Back then, Dad wasn’t feeling well. I was out of town on a business trip for the past few days. It’s not like you don’t know!” ”

PA —

Ye Langhua took out a stack of documents and threw them on the conference table.

“”Then, take a look at what these are. Were you out of town on a business trip back then? Did you bring Little Half Moon along on a business trip?”Ye Langhua practically roared, “Xi Muwen, Little Half Moon is your biological daughter! Your blood is flowing through her body! How could you bear to do such a thing! has your conscience been eaten by a dog?” ”

Xi Muwen picked up the documents on the table and his hands could not help but tremble.

He did not expect ye Langhua to discover these things.

Thirty-six years!

“If ye Langhua could have discovered it, she would have discovered it long ago. She would not have waited until now! ”

Could it be that there was an expert behind ye Langhua?

“If there wasn’t someone behind ye Langhua, ye Langhua wouldn’t have discovered this! ”

“Xi Muwen tried his best to calm himself down. He gulped and raised his head to look at ye Langhua, “Langhua, listen to me. It’s really not like this! Someone is framing me! He wants to drive a wedge between us husband and wife! You mustn’t fall for it!” ”

“”It’s already so late, and you’re still pretending! Are you doing half a month wrong by doing this?” ”

“Xi muwen continued, “Lang Hua, half a month has been found. Let bygones be bygones! “From now on, the three of us will live happily together. If you don’t like Yang Jiao and Mind Yang Jiao, I can divorce Yang Jiao immediately! We’ll move out with Little Half Moon! Yes! Remarry! Lang Hua, let’s remarry!” ”

Remarry!

Remarry immediately!

Ye Lang Hua loved him so much that he would definitely agree to remarry!

“However, after Xi Muwen finished his sentence, Ye Lang Hua’s face did not show any joy. “Remarry? Xi Muwen, how can you still have the face to say such words!” ”

“”Let’s just do it for Little Half Moon, okay? Lang Hua, let’s remarry!” ”

“Ye Langhua stood up from the chair. “Did you forget that she has another name, Jiang Yan?” ”

Jiang Yan!

“When he heard this name, Xi Muwen’s brows jumped. How did ye Langhua know this name. ”

Could it be that she had discovered Jiang Yan’s identity as well?

“Before XI Muwen could think about it, the meeting room’s door was opened. ”

A few uniformed police officers filed in from outside.

“Who’s XI Muwen?”

“Xi Muwen was stunned. “I, I am.” ”

“The police officer in front showed his police ID card and continued, “We are police officers from Shuanghe Road. We suspect that you are related to the crime of intentional abandonment and attempted murder. Please come with us!” ”

“Xi muwen quickly explained, “Comrade police officer, you must have misunderstood!” ”

“”Whether it’s a misunderstanding or not, let’s talk about it at the station! Don’t worry, we police won’t frame a good person, and we won’t let a bad person off!” ”

“As soon as he said this, a cold handcuff was handcuffed to XI Muwen’s wrist. ”

“Xi Muwen turned to look at ye Langhua. “Langhua! I’m Innocent! You have to believe me! Langhua... Langhua, you have to believe me...” ”

Ye Langhua watched Xi Muwen’s back without any expression on her face.

“Thirty-six years ago, she had already made a mistake. ”

“This time, she would not be wrong again! ”

On the other side.

At the Xi family’s villa.

Yang Jiao was waiting for Ye Langhua at home.

“Who knew that ye Langhua would not be there and instead, she would be waiting for the people from the court. ”

“Xi Empire’s losses were severe. This villa had already been mortgaged to the court, and the court had requested Yang Jiao and the others to move out of the villa within seven days! ”

“Yang Jiao panicked and immediately contacted Xi Muwen, but the person who answered the phone was a police officer. ”

The police officer passed the phone to XI Muwen. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Over the phone, Xi Muwen explained the situation briefly and instructed Yang Jiao to find a lawyer for him. ”
