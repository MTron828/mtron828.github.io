“Chapter 1636: 333: successfully landing on Neptune, face slapping! 4”

Translator: 549690339

What were Cen Shaoqing and Ye Zhuo?

They didn’t even have the right to pour water for Dr. Cara!

“David smiled and said, “You deserve all this.””

“Tang Xue was very excited, but she was also glad that she didn’t make the wrong choice.”

“She, Dr. Cara, had done so much with country C. in the future, Dr. Cara would help her become half the owner of Cen’s base no matter what.”

David took the nuclear bomb and walked quickly to Dr. Cara. He bent down slightly and whispered a few words into Dr. Cara’s ear.

“Hearing this, Dr. Cara’s lips curled into a proud smile.”

He knew that the Chinese would not let him down!

“Where’s The Thing?”Dr. Cara looked at David.

David handed the thing to Dr. Cara.

Dr. Cara opened the lid and saw the thing inside. The smile on his face became more obvious.

Good.

Very good.

“In a moment, Dr. Cara pressed the communicator beside his ear. “Dr. YC.””

“Speak.”

“It was a very simple word, but it was loud and clear. It was transmitted to everyone’s ears through the loudspeaker.”

“The next second, ye Zao switched to the screen. On the big screen at the scene, the internal video of the aircraft carrier appeared.”

“Everyone stared at the big screen, afraid that they would miss something.”

“Professor Cara looked up at the big screen and asked, “Dr. YC, when will it take off?””

“Look at the timer at the back.”Ye Zao lowered his head to set the trajectory and the time to land on Neptune.

“After he said that, professor Cara and the others noticed that the numbers were rolling on the big screen behind ye Zao.”

“35,34,33,32...”

“”Even though I know that it’s impossible for an aircraft carrier to reach the speed of light, I’m still looking forward to it. I don’t know what I’m looking forward to!””

“”20 seconds left! Go, China! Go, Professor YC!””

“10 seconds!”

“Let’s Witness YC’s face-smacking moment together.”

“Ah Ah Ah! I’m so excited! I believe in YC’s father! She’ll definitely be able to realize her plan to land on Neptune.”

“”I think these Chinese people are crazy. They actually believe in YC. They don’t even know that they’re about to die. Just Wait, YC will lose face soon.””

“However, when the number on the timer changed to ‘8’, the bodyguard next to Dr. Cara waved his hand.”

“The bodyguard immediately walked to his side and asked, “Dr. Cara, what are your orders?””

Dr. Cara said a few words in a low voice before handing the box containing the nuclear bomb to the bodyguard.

“The bodyguard immediately took the box. “Alright, I’ll do it right away!””

Dr. Cara looked at the huge object in the air with a mocking expression on his face.

Just you wait.

“Soon, YC and that group of trash from the Chinese scientific and technological world would be buried in the abnormal explosion!”

“The shooter loaded the nuclear bomb into the gun barrel, aimed at the aircraft carrier, and fired.”

Whoosh —

The sophisticated nuclear bomb seemed to be covered with a biting cold deterrent force.

Fast!

Too Fast!

“In the defense cabin, when Tang Mi saw the nuclear bomb on the screen, the corners of her mouth curled up. “This group of Chinese people are really sneaky! They actually used this trick!””

“Cen Jiang walked over with a smile. “Unfortunately, Kara and miss ye are not at the same height at all. Let alone such a small nuclear bomb, even if an asteroid flew over from outer space, we would be able to digest it directly!””

The defense level of an aircraft carrier was SSS!

It could deal with all kinds of unexpected dangers in space.

“For example, an asteroid, a meteorite, or an alien attack!”

“After all, they were in outer space. No one knew what dangers would happen.”

“Therefore, a small nuclear bomb was like a joke in Cen Jiang and Tang Mi’s eyes. They did not have to worry at all.”

“Under normal circumstances, the naked eye could not observe the trajectory of the nuclear bomb flying towards the aircraft carrier, but Dr. Cara’s eyes were installed with advanced chips, he quickly locked onto the location of the nuclear bomb.”

“3,2,1 –”

Now.

The nuclear bomb directly shot into the interior of the aircraft carrier!

Dr. Cara’s lips curled slightly.

“The next second, the curvature of Dr. Cara’s lips froze.”

Because there was no explosion in the air.

It was as if nothing had happened.

It shouldn’t be.

It shouldn’t be!

The power of this nuclear bomb was enough to destroy an island. How could it be so calm?

Could it be that the nuclear bomb had been changed?

He had checked it carefully just now. There was nothing wrong with the nuclear bomb.

Dr. Cara simply swallowed his throat.

Could it be... ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Could it be that the aircraft carrier’s defense system had taken effect?

Dr. Cara had never expected that the aircraft carrier’s defense system would be so advanced.

“At this moment, ye Zao’s voice came from the microphone, “Dr. Cara, a wise man does not do evil deeds. I will treat the nuclear bomb that you asked your men to deliver as a salute to me!””
