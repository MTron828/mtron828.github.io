Translator: 549690339

Song Shiyu didn’t expect Chen Siyao to look for ye Zhuo.

“What was Miss Ye’s reaction?”Song Shiyu looked at his assistant and asked.

“The assistant said, “Miss Ye didn’t have any special reaction. She left after paying for the tea.” ”

Paid for the tea?

It seemed like that person was angry.

“If not, Ye Zhuo wouldn’t have directly thrown a look at her. ”

“Song Shiyu tapped the table with his index finger. “Okay, I got it. You can leave now.” ”

“Okay.”The assistant nodded.

“Although song Shiyu didn’t do anything or even react, he knew that the Chen family was doomed. ”

Chen Siyao repeatedly challenged song Shiyu’s bottom line.

Third Master song wasn’t the kind of person who would suffer in silence.

“After his assistant left, song Shiyu made another call. ”

“Come to my study in ten minutes.”

“”Yes, Boss.” ”

On the other side. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

The Chen family.

Old Master Chen had given up hope after being rejected twice.

“Life had a face. Since song Shiyu wasn’t willing, he couldn’t keep pressuring him. If outsiders found out, they would think that Chen Siyao couldn’t get married. ”

Neither Chen Siyao nor the Chen family could afford to lose face!

“After being rejected by Ye Zao, Chen Siyao became very dispirited. She even became a villain, trying to use other methods to change ye Zao’s mind. ”

But... it was useless.

“When Chen Siyao sent another message to ye Zao, it showed that she had been blacklisted by Ye Zao. ”

Chen Siyao was so angry that she directly dropped her phone.

Bang!

The phone instantly shattered into pieces.

What should she do?

Her only hope was gone.

Was she really going to copy the plot in the TV series and marry Song Shiyu’s photo.

No.

She was going to become the authentic Mrs. Song.

Song Shiyu was her only husband in her life.

Chen Siyao came to grandfather Chen’s courtyard.

“Grandfather Chen was sitting in a rocking chair sunbathing. He said he was sunbathing, but he was actually worried. ”

He was really worried about Chen Siyao.

“In his eyes, song Shiyu was the most suitable person to be the grandson-in-law of the Chen family. ”

“”Grandfather.”At this moment, Chen Siyao’s voice suddenly sounded in the air. ”

Old Master Chen sighed in his heart and opened his eyes to look at Chen Siyao. “She’s here.”

“Chen Siyao directly knelt by the rocking chair and said in a sobbing voice, “Grandfather, can you think of a way?” ”

“”Yaoyao, do you have to do this?”Old Master Chen looked at his precious granddaughter helplessly. ”

“Chen Siyao tried her best to suppress her emotions. “Grandfather, I really love to meet people. From the first time I met him, I secretly decided that I would marry him in the future.” ”

“But he doesn’t have you in his heart. He clearly told me that he can marry anyone but you.”Old Master Chen was also disappointed.

How did he meet such a granddaughter.

“If Miss Ye was his granddaughter, he would probably wake up laughing in his dreams. ”

Unfortunately.

Things didn’t go as planned.

“Chen siyao continued, “Grandfather, I don’t care. I Don’t care who he likes. Who’s in his heart? I just want to marry her.” ”

Marrying song Shiyu had already become Chen Siyao’s obsession.

“All these years, no matter what she did, her starting point was definitely song Shiyu. ”

“Song Shiyu liked to smoke, so she started collecting all kinds of rare and expensive cigarettes. She even planted her own tobacco. ”

“When song Shiyu started to quit smoking, she started paying attention to all kinds of food that helped him quit smoking... ”

“Song Shiyu liked Ginger water with brown sugar, so she personally boiled ginger water with brown sugar for him. ”

“Song Shiyu fell in love with antiques for a period of time, so she went to meet a master in the antique industry... ”

“From the very beginning, she was destined to live for Song Shiyu. ”

“As long as she could marry song Shiyu and stay by his side every day, Chen Siyao was willing to do anything for him. ”

“”Yaoyao, I’ve told you everything I need to say. Why don’t you have any sense of shame?”Old Master Chen frowned. “He, Song Shiyu, doesn’t like you! He doesn’t like our Chen family either!” ”

“As his grandfather, Old Master Chen didn’t want to speak so harshly. ”

But he couldn’t.

“If he didn’t get to the point, Chen Siyao would never wake up. ”

There were some things that had to be said.

“”Grandfather, can you think of a way? I know, you definitely have a way!”Old Master Chen was, after all, Song Shiyu’s Savior. ”

“Grandpa Chen was a person who cared a lot about his face, but some things could not be done smoothly because of his face? ”

He had to put down his dignity.

“”There’s no other way.”Grandpa Chen shook his head. “For your sake, I even put my old face on the line.” ”
