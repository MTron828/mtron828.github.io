“Halfway through the meal, a message suddenly came from Cen Shaoqing’s phone. ”

It was from ye Zhuo. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Cen Shaoqing immediately put down his chopsticks, picked up his phone, and looked at the message. ”

It was a very short five-word message.

Return in three days.

“In fact, Ye Zhuo and ye Han had already set off, but it would take three days to cross the Milky Way from the s galaxy to Earth. ”

“After receiving ye Zhuo’s message, Cen Shaoqing waited for the Moon and stars until the last day. ”

“Cen Shaoqing came to the base, sat in his office, and kept flipping through his phone. ”

“At this moment, a light suddenly appeared on the interstellar map. ”

The light was getting brighter and faster.

It was the interstellar shuttle!

“Cen Xiaoqing immediately stood up and walked out of the office, all the way to the room where the interstellar shuttle was placed. ”

The interstellar shuttle roamed the quantum realm. Humans could not see it with their naked eyes. Cen Shaoqing could only determine their exact location through the map on his phone.

“At this moment, a small black dot landed on the ground. ”

“The small black dot grew bigger and bigger. In the end, it actually transformed into the appearance of an interstellar shuttle! ”

“Cen Shaoqing immediately stood up. His slender fingers touched the door handle of the shuttle. Very quickly, the door was pulled open. ”

“In the next second, Cen Shaoqing was hugged by someone. A familiar fragrance assaulted him. ”

It was especially nice.

It had been a long time since they last met. Cen Shaoqing was a little nervous and did not know where to put his hands.

“Ye Zao put his hands around his waist and tiptoed. He whispered in his ear, “Mr. Cen, long time no see.” ”

“The corners of Cen Shaoqing’s lips curled up slightly. He hooked his hands around her slender waist and opened his thin lips. “Miss Ye, welcome back.” ”

“As he finished speaking, ye Zhuo pressed his red lips onto his thin lips. ”

His aura became subtle.

Ye Han walked to the entrance of the aircraft. What he saw was a scene that was unsuitable for children. Ye Han immediately turned around and returned.

Don’t look when it’s indecent.

Don’t look when it’s indecent!

“A few minutes later, Ye Zhuo released cen Shaoqing and continued, “Oh right, I’ll introduce you to someone.” ”

Cen Shaoqing slowly tidied up his sleeves and slowly raised his eyes.

“Ye Zhuo looked at the shuttle. “Ye Han, come out.” ”

“Hearing Ye Zhuo’s voice, Ye Han walked out of the shuttle. ”

He was about eighteen or nineteen years old.

“He was handsome, sunny, and handsome. When he walked on the street, he was the type that could make a bunch of girls scream. ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “My brother, Ye Han.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly and extended his right hand to Ye Han. “Hello, I’m your sister’s boyfriend, Cen Shaoqing.” ”

“The residents of changyue were originally humans, so they still kept the habit of shaking hands. Ye Han extended his hand to hold Cen Shaoqing’s hand, “Mr. Cen, my sister is the number one female monarch of changyue. Her body is delicate and precious. If I find out that you bullied her, no matter where you are, even if you chase her to the ends of the Earth, I will definitely make you pay the price!” ”

“When he said the last sentence, Ye Han increased the strength of his hand. ”

“Cen Shaoqing acted as if he did not feel anything. His face maintained a polite arc. “Don’t worry, I will never let her down.” ”

Ye Han was stunned.

He originally thought that Cen Shaoqing was just an ordinary human. He did not expect that Cen Shaoqing could actually withstand his imprisonment.

One had to know that his hand strength was one of the best in changyue.

Ye Han sized him up.

“Cen Shaoqing’s expression did not change. He was as steady as Mount Tai, as if nothing had happened just now. ”

“A moment later, Ye Han let go of Cen Shaoqing’s hand and said meaningfully, “Mr. Cen’s skills are not bad.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing held the Buddha bead in his left hand. “Little brother, you are also not bad.” ”

As expected of ye Zhuo’s little brother.

“If it was anyone else, they would not be able to withstand his counterattack. ”

“Ye Han’s gaze turned to Cen Shaoqing’s left hand and continued, “Do you believe in Buddhism?” ”

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Ye Han frowned and said, “If you believe in Buddhism, why are you still dating my sister? You Won’t let my sister become a widow for you, right?” ”

“Ye Zao was shocked by Ye Han’s words. He turned his head to look at Ye Han, shock written all over his face. ”

“When he looked at Cen Shaoqing again, he was very calm. His thin lips parted slightly. “Brother, don’t worry. I’m doing fine. I’ll give your sister happiness.” ”

“When Ye Han came, he was still worried that ye Zao’s boyfriend would be unreliable. Now that he saw Cen Shaoqing, he was completely at ease. ”

Because no one was more reliable than Cen Shaoqing.

“In the country of changyue, the height of men was around 185. Cen Shaoqing’s height was estimated to be 1.9 meters. He was handsome and had an extraordinary temperament. With just a glance, one could tell that he was a dragon and Phoenix among men! ”

“Moreover, his skills were not bad and he was on par with ye Zao. This way, there was no need to worry that ye Zao would have no one to protect him in the future ”
