Chapter 138: 083: torturing scum, satisfying people’s hearts! Great Motherly Love 4

Ye Zao controlled her strength.

It was neither light nor heavy.

It just so happened to cause blood to flow out of her forehead.

Her face was originally pale, so even the slightest injury would be obvious. At this moment, it looked even more shocking.

“Zao Zao!”Ye Shu rushed over and hugged ye Zao.

“Mom! I’m in so much pain!”Ye Zao hugged ye Shu, displaying the essence of acting and began to moan.

No one expected this sudden scene.

“Isn’t it just a little blood? It Won’t kill anyone!”Yao Cuifen glared at Ye Zhuo. “Little Bastard! I think you did it on purpose!”

When ye Zhuo was holding the feather duster just now, he was still so strong. Why did he lose his strength now?

“My Daughter isn’t a bastard! She’s not a bastard!”Ye Shu couldn’t hold it in anymore and roared, “Get out of Here! Get out of here right now!”

“We won’t leave without 100 million!”Yao Cuifen rolled her eyes at Ye Shu.

Her daughter was a coward.

She seemed to be very angry, but perhaps she was already planning how to transfer the money to them.

Ye Shu helped ye Zao to the sofa and sat down, then rushed into the kitchen.

When she came out, she had a kitchen knife in her hand!

Yao Cuifen and ye Dafu were both shocked.

Ye Shuai and Lin Xiaowei were also shocked.

“Xiaoshu! I’m telling you! Don’t mess around! Killing is against the law! I’m your brother, she’s your sister-in-law, and they’re your parents!”

Ye Shu looked at these four relatives in name, “You’re not my brother! I don’t have a brother! And them, they’re even more unworthy to be my parents! They say that if you’re born without a father, you can return the broken finger. Today, I’ll return this favor to you! From now on, we’ll cut it off!”

With that said!

Ye Shu raised her knife and slashed down.

A part of her index finger was cut off just like that.

The air was frighteningly quiet.

At this moment.

Even ye Zhuo was frightened.

She didn’t expect that ye Shu would lay a hand on her.

“Mom!”Ye Zhuo rushed over.

“Mom is fine!”

Ye Shu’s face was deathly pale as she looked at Yao Cuifen, Ye Dafu, Ye Shuai, and Lin Xiaowei, “From now on, other than my surname being Ye, I have nothing to do with you people! “In the future, if you come to disturb our mother and daughter’s lives again, I’ll kill you! “I’ll kill two of you! I’ll kill until your family is exterminated! At worst, we’ll die together! “I don’t want to live anymore anyway!”

After saying that, ye Shu fiercely chopped the kitchen knife on the wooden dining table.

The edge of the knife was stained with blood.

The severed finger was on the side.

It made one’s hair stand on end!

Yao Cuifen, Ye Dafu, and the others were so scared that they were trembling.

They just wanted to ask for some money.

They didn’t expect things to develop like this.

Even more unexpectedly, when Ye Shu became ruthless, she even stamped her own finger.

She was so ruthless to herself, what else was there that she didn’t dare to do?

No one doubted that her words were fake. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Compared to her life?

What was money?

At that moment, the few of them looked at each other and ran away in fear, afraid that ye Shu would chop them to death with a kitchen knife in the next second!

Seeing that the few of them had run away.

Ye Shu let out a sigh of relief.

After dialing 120, Ye Zhuo found the first aid kit and gave ye Shu emergency treatment. Her vision was blurry. Ye Zhuo took a cotton swab and wiped his tears with his arm. “Mom, are you okay? Does it hurt?”

It was the first time in her life.

She truly experienced the love of a mother.

It was also the first time she knew what it meant to be a weak woman and a strong mother.

It had been a long time since ye Zao came back, but this was the first time ye Shu saw her cry. She smiled and comforted her, “It’s okay, it doesn’t hurt at all! Zao Zao, Don’t Cry, Mom really doesn’t hurt. Oh Right, Zao Zao, is your head okay? Does it still hurt?”

“It doesn’t hurt, it doesn’t hurt at all! Mom, I’m sorry, I’m sorry! I could have avoided it just now, it’s all my fault!”Ye Zhuo began to regret why she did that just now.

If she hadn’t played along, Ye Shu wouldn’t have broken her finger.

It was she who underestimated the power of maternal love.

“Silly child! How can you be blamed for this? For people like your grandparents, you have to do this to get it over with once and for all. Otherwise, we will never have a good life! Silly Child, don’t cry. Mom really doesn’t hurt at all. Isn’t it just a finger?”

For her daughter, she had to throw caution to the wind!

Originally, ye Shu wanted to spend some money to settle things.

However, when she saw the moment ye Zhuo was injured.

She knew.

If not to throw caution to the wind, the mother and daughter will never have peace.
