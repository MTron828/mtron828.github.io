“Feng Xianxian came back to her senses and wanted to stop him, but it was too late. ”

Ye Zao had already taken the silver needle and pierced it into Old Lady Lin’s auricular acupoint.

Old Lady Lin only felt a wave of dizziness in her head.

Boom!

Something exploded in front of her eyes.

“After the dizziness, there was a violent headache. ”

Old Lady Lin closed her eyes and fainted just like that.

Seeing this scene.

Everyone sucked in a breath of cold air.

Feng Xianxian’s face was pale. She stretched out her hand to check Old Lady Lin’s breath.

“No, she was not breathing! ”

Feng Xianxian was delighted.

Good!

Great!

She had thought that ye Zao really had some ability to cure Old Lady Lin.

She did not expect that one needle would send old lady Lin to the afterlife.

“Now that there was no evidence of her death and Ye Zao was the murderer who killed Old Lady Lin, who would be able to stand in her way in the future? ”

“Although she was very happy, Feng Xianxian still pretended to be very sad. Her sobbing voice sounded, “Grandma! Grandma, are you okay? Ye Zao! I know that you have never liked Grandma and hated Grandma! But even if you hate grandma, you can’t do this to her! You actually killed Grandma! This is your own Grandma! Ye Zao, don’t you have a conscience? !” ”

Dead?

Old Lady Lin is dead? 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“This time, the crowd completely exploded. ”

No one expected that Old Lady Lin would actually die.

“Ye Zao’s brows and eyes were still the same, there wasn’t even the slightest trace of panic on her face. ”

Feng Xianxian narrowed her eyes.

“Old Lady Lin was no longer breathing, could it be that ye Zao still had the ability to bring her back from the dead? ”

All she needed to do now was to put on a good show.

She did not expect that even God was helping her.

“Grandma! Grandma!”Feng Xianxian lay on Old Lady Lin and cried miserably. “Please Wake Up!”

She looked like a filial granddaughter.

“At this moment, Old Lady Lin, who had her eyes closed, suddenly opened her eyes. Before Feng Xianxian could react. ”

PA —

A slap landed directly on Feng Xianxian’s face.

This slap stunned everyone.

Feng Xianxian felt as if a mountain was pressing down on her. Blood flowed backwards from her body and her face instantly turned pale.

She could move?

Old Lady Lin could actually move!

Wasn’t she dead?

What was going on?

Feng Xianxian covered her left cheek and looked at Old Lady Lin in disbelief.

“”B * Tch! You snake-hearted B * Tch!”Although Old Lady Lin could move her hands and speak, she still could not stand up. She sat in her wheelchair and could only look at Feng Xianxian. ”

That gaze was as if it was going to eat her up.

Feng Xianxian was immediately stunned and did not know how to react for a moment.

“Seeing that Old Lady Lin did not recover, the reporters immediately passed the microphones over. “Old Lady Lin, may I ask if you have signed the share concession letter and are willing to leave all the shares of the Lin Group to Miss Feng?” ”

“Old Madam Lin said, “No! “I have not signed any share concession letter, and I have not left any will! “The reason why I suddenly had a stroke and became paralyzed was also because of the poison that this B * Tch Feng Xianxian had poisoned me! “After I was poisoned, she forged the share concession letter and the will and pressed my hand on the forged share concession letter and Will!” ”

Old Lady Lin could finally speak. She wished she could tell her everything that she had suffered during this period of time.

It felt so good to be able to speak.

“When she said this, everyone was in an uproar. ”

No one had expected that things would turn out this way.

“Feng Xianxian tried her best to calm herself down. “No, I didn’t! I didn’t do these things. Grandmother, did you remember wrongly? The share rights and will were all decided by you! I didn’t force you! No!” ”

“Old Mrs. Lin raised her head to look at Feng Xianxian, her gaze terrifyingly cold, “I raised you for twenty years! I doted on you for twenty years! I treated you better than my own granddaughter! I even turned against my own biological son and granddaughter because of you! But what about you? Is this how you repay me? You actually poisoned me! Slut! You deserve to die!” ”

Old Mrs. Lin never thought that Feng Xianxian would lay a hand on her one day.

“If she hadn’t experienced all this herself, old Mrs. Lin wouldn’t have believed it. ”

No one knew how happy old Mrs. Lin was at the moment.

She could finally speak.

She could finally expose Feng Xianxian’s crimes in front of everyone.

“During the ten days in the hospital, Old Mrs. Lin even thought that she was going to die under Feng Xianxian’s torture. ”
