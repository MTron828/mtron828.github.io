There was also old Mrs. Cen.

“In this world, there was nothing more painful than sending someone to their death. ”

“However, there were some people who were not used to using wounds to show others. ”

“Cen Haifeng had just said that he had forgotten, and he wanted to mention all the things that had happened in the past? ”

How Fair was this to the people that he had hurt? UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Hearing this, Cen Haifeng was stunned. He raised his head and looked at Cen Shaoqing. “Mr. Shao, do we know each other before?” ”

“No.”Cen Shaoqing’s voice was a little deep and cold.

No?

Cen Haifeng frowned slightly.

Did he really not know each other?

Why would a person he did not know say these words to him for no reason?

Could it be that Shao Qing knew something?

“Moreover, the twenty years that Shao Qing mentioned happened to be the twenty years that he had been on the throne for. ”

Or could it be that.

Shao Qing knew someone who had been hurt by him in his forgotten memories?

“CEN Haifeng continued, “Mr. Shao, I think you’re right. Twenty Years is just a blink of an eye for a lover, but for someone who values relationships, it’s like a year. “That’s why I can’t wait to get my memories back. What happened has already happened. What we need to do now is how to make up for it.” ”

“Hopefully, there was still time. ”

Cen Shaoqing did not say anything.

“For a moment, he did not know how to face Cen Haifeng. ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Uncle Cen, please don’t mind. My boyfriend always talks like this.” ”

“Cen Haifeng smiled and said, “I think what Mr. Shao said makes sense.” ”

“After he said that, Cen Haifeng turned to look at ye Zao and said, “Miss Zhuo, can you help me take a look? Two-thirds of my life has already passed. I want to use the rest of my time to find myself.” ”

“Did you only recently suspect that you were under a forbidden spell?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“Cen Haifeng nodded, “To tell you the truth, I’ve always had a headache. Half a month ago, after I ate the pill my wife gave me, I had a strange dream. From then on, the faces of some people in the capital would appear in my mind...” ”

Wife...

Who was he calling his wife?

“Although Cen Haifeng had forgotten about Zhou Xiang, Cen Shaoqing still felt very uncomfortable when he heard this title. ”

“If Duanmu Huangfei was the wife he was talking about, then what was Zhou Xiang? ”

What was Zhou Xiang’s years of waiting for him?

“Cen Shaoqing clenched his hand into a fist. Because he had used too much strength, his knuckles had turned slightly white until a soft hand was placed on his hand. ”

Only then did the nameless anger in Cen Shaoqing’s heart dissipate a little.

“Ye Zhuo turned to look at Cen Haifeng, he then said, “Alright, I understand. If you believe me, I can help you take a look. However, what I have learned is just a superficial skill. Whether or not I can successfully remove the restriction is still up to you.” ”

The forbidden technique differed from person to person.

“If the person who had been removed from the restriction could not wait to break free from the restriction of the forbidden technique, the forbidden technique could be removed. ”

“On the other hand, if the person who was unbound had an indifferent attitude, the forbidden spell would never be removed. ”

“”Thank you, Miss Zhuo!” ”

“Ye Zhuo took out a pill and handed it to Cen Haifeng. “If you believe me, you can eat this pill.” ”

“”Miss Zhuo, I believe you.”Cen Haifeng took the pill. ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “After you eat this pill, you will be in a coma for about two days. Please think carefully.” ”

“”I’ve thought about it.”Cen Haifeng took the pill. “I’ll leave it to Miss Zhuo and Mr. Shao for the next two days. After this is done, I’ll definitely reward the two of you handsomely!” ”

“Just as ye Zhuo had said, after taking the pill, Cen Haifeng’s head instantly became heavy and his legs became light. In the next second, Cen Haifeng directly lost consciousness. ”

Ye Zhuo looked at Cen Shaoqing. “Help uncle to the bed inside.”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly and helped CEN Haifeng inside.

Ye Zao went to get the medical kit.

“In the blink of an eye, Cen Shaoqing and Cen Haifeng were the only ones left in the room. ”

Cen Shaoqing stood by the bed. His thin lips were tightly pursed. No expression could be seen on his face.

It would be a lie to say that he did not hate Cen Haifeng.

“But looking at him now, there seemed to be some unspeakable reasons... ”

“Very soon, ye Zao came over. ”

“Cen Shaoqing turned to look at ye Zao. “Zao Zao, what should we do now?” ”

“Ye Zao said, “Lift uncle’s ban.” ”

“Lift the ban?”Cen Shaoqing was stunned. “Do you really know how to do that?”

“Ye Zao nodded slightly and continued, “Although I’m not a descendant of the fifth family, I’m a good friend of the fifth lunar month’s descendant, Diulan. Alan had no children in his life, so before he died, he gave me the method to lift the ban.” ”

“She and diulan were old friends, so they called each other by their names. ”
