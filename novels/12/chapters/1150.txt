“Okay.”Father Zhao nodded. “Go do your work.”

Old Zhang turned around and walked out of the door.

In the house.

Father Zhao sighed again.

Bodhisattva bless.

Bless him that he must find Zhao Ziye.

Once he found his son.

“As long as he could find his son, he was willing to give up everything! ”

“After thinking for a while, Father Zhao walked towards the temple hall. After burning an incense stick, he sincerely kowtowed several times. ”

Zhou family.

Ma Jia Yue was still waiting for Zhao Xueyin to call her to tell her the good news.

“However, after waiting for a long time, she still didn’t receive a call from Zhao Xueyin. ”

What was going on?

“Could it be that after Zhao Xueyin sent ye Zhuo to prison, she had forgotten about her? ”

That wouldn’t do!

“With this in mind, Ma Jia Yue hurriedly dialed Zhao Xueyin’s number. ”

“Upon seeing Ma Jia Yue’s call, Zhao Xueyin immediately cut it off without thinking. ”

Ma Jiayue still had the cheek to call her!

“If it wasn’t for Ma Jiayue, she wouldn’t have lost so badly! ”

“Looking at the phone that was hung up, Ma Jiayue became even more confused. ”

“Logically speaking, Zhao Xueyin shouldn’t have reacted like this. ”

Something must have happened.

Ma Jiayue called a little sister.

The Little Sister’s husband was the police station.

She must know something.

After hanging up the phone.

Ma Jianyue’s face turned pale.

All right.

Wang Sao’s lover was actually fine.

“Not only was he fine, but he also implicated Zhao Xueyin and almost got detained for ten days. ”

No Wonder Zhao Xueyin was so angry.

She didn’t even pick up the phone.

“For a moment, Ma Jianyue was very anxious. ”

She was worried that her mother-in-law would scold her if she knew about this.

“If it wasn’t for her, the person who had recovered now would be mother-in-law Zhou. ”

She was also afraid that Zhao Xueyin would hold a grudge against her.

“After a long while, Ma Jiayue finally calmed down and got someone to call the butler over. ”

“”Madam, you were looking for me.” ”

Ma Jiayue nodded. “Go to Aunt Wang’s house right now and tell her that she doesn’t have to come to work tomorrow.”

This matter must not be known by mother-in-law.

“If she allowed mother-in-law ye Zao’s prescription to cure Aunt Wang’s lover, then she would be finished! ”

“Even though Granny Zhou was old, she still had diabetes. ”

“In fact, the life and death of the Zhou family was in her hands. ”

The Butler was stunned.

“Ma jiayue continued, “Don’t worry, I will compensate her three months’salary.” ”

“”Okay, I understand.” ”

“Ma jiayue continued, “If the old lady asks about Auntie Zhang, you can say that the family has something to do and you have to resign.” ”

The butler nodded.

“After instructing the butler, Ma Jiayue personally made a trip to the Zhao family to apologize to Father Zhao and Zhao Xueyin. ”

On the other side.

Jiang Corporation.

Jiang Corporation had suffered a lot recently and its shares had fallen by the daily limit for a week.

It was on the verge of declaring bankruptcy and withdrawing from the financial world.

“Under such circumstances, the Chief CEO of Jiang Corporation, Jiang Chao, could only seek help. ”

“After running for an entire afternoon, Jiang Chao still couldn’t find anyone to lend a helping hand. ”

“At this moment, Jiang Chao thought of someone. ”

Zhao Xueyin. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Although Shunxi Financial Group wasn’t ranked in the top ten in the international rankings, it was still an unshakable position in the financial world of China. ”

Zhao Xueyin was also the acting chief of Shunxi Financial Group.

“As long as Zhao Xueyin was willing to help, the Jiang Corporation would definitely be able to come back to life. ”

Furthermore.

This was a mutually beneficial cooperation.

There was no reason for Zhao Xueyin not to agree.

“Thinking of this, Jiang Chao called his secretary over. “Help me make an appointment with Miss Zhao from the Shunxi Financial Group.” ”

“The secretary said, “Alright.” ”

About ten minutes later.

“The secretary came to the office. “Director Jiang, Miss Zhao’s appointment has already been scheduled for two weeks later.” ”

Two weeks later?

Jiang Chao frowned slightly.

“Based on the current situation, the Jiang Financial Group would not be able to wait for a week. ”

No.

He had to think of a way.

“At this moment, Jiang Chao suddenly thought that Jiang Xiaoyu and Zhao Xueyin were very good friends. ”

He could use Jiang Xiaoyu to discuss the collaboration.

“Thinking of this, a smile finally appeared on Father Zhao’s face. He immediately called Jiang Xiaoyu. ”

“When Jiang Xiaoyu received the call, she was completely dumbfounded. ”

He wanted her to contact Zhao Xueyin?

But she had already cut off all ties with Zhao Xueyin!

“Xiaoyu! You and Miss Zhao are good friends. It’s most appropriate for you to tell her about this. Whether our family can continue to survive in the financial world will depend on you!”

“The words of rejection were on the tip of her tongue, but Jiang Xiaoyu could not say the amount of money. ”

“If she refused, her family would be expelled from the financial world. ”

No.

She couldn’t do that.

“Jiang Xiaoyu took a deep breath and pretended to be very relaxed. “Okay, Dad. I got it. I’ll go find Xue Yin now.” ”
