Translator: 549690339

“Zhou cuihua asked, “Is this the room Xia Xiaoman is staying in now?” ”

“No.”Li hang shook his head.

“Zhou cuihua said in surprise, “If it’s not Xia Xiaoman, then who is it? An Lizi?” ”

“Not really.”Li Hang continued to shake his head.

“Zhou cuihua seemed to have suddenly thought of something and continued, “Could it be that the rich businessman is raising a concubine outside? This is too arrogant, he actually dared to bring a concubine directly into the house!” ”

“”Mom, what are you thinking about!”Li hang said somewhat speechlessly, “How can there be someone who would openly take care of a mistress! And I think that the rich businessman really loves Xia Xiaoman!” ”

“”Impossible! Absolutely Impossible!”Zhou cuihua smiled and waved her hand, “How can there be someone who likes that kind of woman who is half-old!” ”

“Seeing her like this, Li Hang did not continue this topic and continued, “Mom, this room is the room of Xia Xiaoman’s nanny!” ” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“What?”Zhou Cuihua’s eyes were filled with disbelief.

The nanny’s room!

A nanny actually lived in such a good room!

What the hell!

“Li hang continued, “Xia Xiaoman’s life now is much better than you think! We have all underestimated her means.” ”

“To be able to live like this, one could imagine Xia Xiaoman’s means. ”

“Zhou cuihua originally wanted Li Hang to watch Xia Xiaoman’s joke, but she didn’t expect that in the end, it would end up like this. ”

“The joke didn’t catch their eye, but it made them extremely envious. ”

“Speaking up to this point, Li hang paused, then continued, “She now has a maid service at home and a personal chauffeur when she goes out. Unlike us, who live in this kind of low-class slum, living there isn’t as good as her nanny.” ”

“The more he spoke, the more Li Hang felt indignant. ”

Very indignant.

“When Zhou Cuihua heard this, she felt extremely uncomfortable. “If I knew about this flower, I would have gone to take a look today!” ”

“Although she felt very uncomfortable, she wanted to see it with her own eyes. People were sometimes so contradictory. ”

“Li hang seemed to have thought of something and continued, “Mom, when I came back today, Xia Xiaoman asked about you. She asked you to visit the Lin family when you have time!” ”

“I’m not going!”Zhou cuihua said.

What was she going to do?

Was she going to watch Xia Xiaoman show off for her?

She couldn’t stand it.

“”No, you’re going. And you have to go politely.”Li hang narrowed his eyes, he looked at Zhou cuihua and said, “I heard that rich businessman likes to drink. Didn’t my dad collect a bottle of old wine from the 1970s? You can bring the old wine with you!” ”

“Hearing that, Zhou Cuihua was speechless and said, “Are you crazy? !” ”

Bring wine for Xia Xiaoman?

“Do you know how much your dad’s bottle of wine is worth?”Zhou cuihua continued to ask.

“”The more expensive it is, the more it shows our sincerity!”Li hang said, “Besides, the Lin family has a lot of money. It’s just a bottle of wine. No matter how expensive it is, it’s only six figures. The Lin family doesn’t care about it at all.” ”

“Zhou cuihua said, “There’s no need for us to curry favor with them!” ”

“Zhou Cuihua was already very jealous when she found out that Xia Xiaoman was living such a good life. Now, Li Hang even asked her to bring a gift to the Lin family to visit. Wasn’t this the same as throwing salt on her wound? ”

“”Mom, Xia Xiaoman is no longer the Xia Xiaoman of the past,”Li Hang said very seriously, “It’s good for us to have a good relationship with her now! “Only through Xia Xiaoman can we get to know people who are not strong enough in our current circle.” ”

“Although Li Hang also didn’t like Xia Xiaoman, and even threw up if he took one more look at her, she had no choice but to bow to reality. ”

“Speaking of this, Li hang continued, “Moreover, I found that an Lizi’s boyfriend doesn’t like an Lizi at all.” ”

“Although he didn’t finish his sentence, it left people with endless reveries. ”

“Hang Hang.”Zhou cuihua raised her head to look at Li Hang.

“The mother and daughter didn’t say much, but at this moment, they both understood each other’s meaning from the other’s eyes. ”

“Li hang nodded. “Yes, Mom.” ”

“Speaking up to this point, li hang continued, “Since Xia Xiaoman can change the trajectory of her life through herself, then I can do the same.” ”

Wealth comes from danger.

“Zhou cuihua licked her lips and said somewhat worriedly, “This, is this really okay?” ”

She was still a little worried.

“”No problem.”Li hang stood up and walked to Zhou Cuihua’s side, holding her arm. “Mom, you just need to accompany me on a trip tomorrow.” ”

“Zhou cuihua hesitated for a moment, then nodded. “Okay.” ”
