“At this moment, Ye Lan thought she was hearing things. ”

What was Qiu di saying?

“Qiu Di said that she was a deranged woman, and he wanted to chase her out? ”

She heard it wrong.

She must have heard it wrong!

Why would Qiu di treat her like this.

“She must have been too happy, so she was hearing things wrong. ”

Ye Lan raised her head to look at autumn flute.”... eldest miss.”

“Autumn flute ignored ye Lan’s gaze and turned to look at Zhou Qing beside her. His gaze was ruthless as he said, “What are you still standing there for! Quickly get this lunatic out of Here!” ”

Lunatic! Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“This time, ye Lan really heard this term. ”

Autumn flute actually called her a lunatic.

How could this be?

“Ye Lan looked at autumn flute. At this moment, her eyes widened. ”

There were thousands of reasons why she had to say it.

“”Yes, eldest miss.” ”

“Sun Xiaoqian, who was disguised as Zhou Qing, sneered in his heart. ”

“Finally, he saw ye Lan suffer retribution! ”

How satisfying!

“In a moment, Sun Xiaoqian walked to Ye Lan’s side, grabbed her wrist, and pulled her out. ”

“Autumn flute slowly curved his lips and said in a gentle tone, “Madam, let’s go this way. Don’t let a crazy person ruin our elegant mood.” ”

Zhao Dan glanced at ye Lan and nodded. “Okay.”

Madman!

Qiu Di actually called her a madman.

Ye Lan thought of Granny Fei’s words.

Could it be.

This was all a trap set up by Qiu Di from the start?

No.

It wouldn’t be.

“She was the Princess of the Full Moon Kingdom. The graceful and elegant woman in front of her, who was like a Phoenix, was her mother! ”

“Thinking of this, Ye Lan suddenly broke free from Sun Xiaolu’s confinement and ran to Zhao Dan. She cried, “Mom! Mom! I’m really a full moon! Mom, you’re here to pick me up, right? Mom!” ”

“Looking at the crazy woman kneeling at his feet, Zhao Dan frowned. Then, he lifted his foot and directly threw ye Lan out. ”

Bang!

“Ye Lan was thrown to the ground, blood dripping from the corner of her mouth. ”

Ye Lan was also stunned.

Why?

Why did things turn out like this?

Could it be that Qiu Di was lying to her?

Why did Qiu di lie to her?

Because of the management rights of the Ye family base?

Ye Lan’s eyes were filled with disbelief.

“”What’s wrong with this crazy woman?”Zhao Dan looked at Qiu Di, his eyes filled with displeasure. ”

“Qiu Di immediately lowered his brows and apologized, “Madam, I’m really sorry! I’ll get someone to get her out immediately! You’re the mother of the world, why bother with her?” ”

“Zhao Dan tidied his clothes. He felt that what Qiu di said was reasonable, so he did not say anything. ”

It was indeed beneath his dignity to be calculative with a madman.

“Qiu Di raised his voice and said, “Zhou Qing! Zhou Qing! get her out of Here!” ”

“Sun Xiaolu immediately ran over, wanting to grab ye Lan. ”

“Ye Lan was after all someone that ye Zhuo had raised, so her skills were naturally much stronger than ordinary people. She directly shook off Sun Xiaolu’s hand and rushed in front of Qiu Di, grabbing onto Qiu di’s collar, “Qiu di! You B * Tch! You Lied to me! Didn’t you say that I’m the full moon Princess of the Manxing Kingdom? Didn’t you say that the ruler and mother of the Manxing Kingdom are my parents?” ”

“”When did I say something like that! Ye Lan! Why Don’t you look at yourself in the mirror and see how much you weigh!”Qiu di frowned coldly. “Even in your dreams, you dare to dream about being a princess of the Manxing Kingdom! This is simply unreasonable!” ”

“Ye Lan just looked at Qiu di like that, and her eyes could not tell what kind of expression she had. ”

She only felt that she was so stupid.

So stupid that she was pitiful!

Kill her.

She wanted to kill the autumn flute.

Ye Lan narrowed her eyes and reached out to pinch the autumn flute’s neck.

Xiu.

“At this moment, a emei spike flew over quickly. Just as it was about to pierce ye Lan’s temple, Ye Lan released the autumn flute and dodged, avoiding the flying emei spike. ”

“In the next second, Ye Han appeared in front of the autumn flute. He reached out to catch the Emei Spike and turned to look at the autumn flute. “Eldest miss, Are You Alright?” ”

“I’m fine.”Qiu Di cleared his throat.

Ye Lan rushed over again. “Qiu di! I’m going to kill you!”

Killing Qiu Di was the only way to vent his anger.

Ye Han immediately went up and fought with Ye Lan.

Qiu Di looked at the two of them and curled his lips.

Ye Han and Ye Lan were originally siblings.

“Now, it was a dog-eat-dog situation. ”

This big show was simply too good to watch.

Unfortunately...

Ye Zhuo would never be able to see it again.

The smug look in autumn flute’s eyes became more and more obvious.

“Ye Lan and Ye Han were both taught by Ye Zhuo, but ye Han wanted ye Lan’s skills to be much better. In less than three moves, he subdued ye Lan. ”

“Although she was subdued by Ye Han, Ye Lan was still unconvinced. She raised her head to look at autumn flute, “Autumn flute! Why did you lie to me! Why did you lie to me! You Slut! Madam, I’m not a lunatic! All of this was Qiu Di’s scheme. She lied to me and said that I was your daughter who went missing in the early years, the full moon! Otherwise, I wouldn’t have lost my composure in front of you! Madam! Please believe me!” ”
