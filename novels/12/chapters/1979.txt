“After finishing his sentence, Xu Chaonan hung up the phone. ”

“Xu Yao had done something wrong, so she should pay the price. ”

“Maybe Xu Yao would hate her temporarily, but in the future, Xu Yao would definitely be grateful to her. ”

“No matter what, she could not let Xu Yao make mistakes again and again. ”

Xu Chaonan looked at the clouds in the sky and sighed deeply.

“At this moment, the sound of sirens came from downstairs. ”

Xu Chaonan looked in the direction of the lounge.

The soundproofing of the lounge was very good. Xu Yao did not hear any sound.

“Soon, she was awakened by the sound of the door opening. ”

Xu Yao woke up from her sleep. She looked up and saw several police officers and Xu Chaonan who was standing behind the police officers.

Xu Yao looked at this scene in disbelief.

What was going on?

What the hell is going on?

“Auntie!”

“Xu Chaonan looked at Xu Yao, he said earnestly, “Yaoyao, it’s not scary for people to do wrong. What’s scary is to refuse to admit your mistakes. I’ve already made a deal with the police officers. As long as you cooperate with them and work hard in prison, not only will they not pursue your responsibility, but you’ll also get a chance to reduce your sentence in the future!” ”

Wasn’t her heart aching to personally hand her niece over to the police officers?

She wished that she could directly take Xu Yao’s place in prison.

But the law would not allow it!

Xu Yao looked at Xu Chaonan and wished that she could bite him to death.

She was already starting to regret it.

“She should not have come to seek refuge with Xu Chaonan. In the eyes of people like Xu Chaonan, there was no kinship at all. ”

Disgusting!

It was simply disgusting!

“Xu Yao roared hysterically, “You are not my aunt! Xu Chaonan! My mother is right, you have never treated me as your niece! Xu Chaonan! I will never forgive you!” ”

“Looking at Xu Yao like this, Xu Chaonan’s eyes were slightly red. The image of Xu Yao when she was young kept appearing in her mind. ”

She didn’t understand.

She didn’t understand why such a cute little girl would become like this.

It was all her fault.

“If she hadn’t been busy with her career and neglected to discipline Xu Yao, Xu Yao wouldn’t have gotten to where she was today. ”

Xu Chaonan was very regretful now as he pinched his temples.

“”Xu Chaonan, don’t be so hypocritical! You’re just like a cat crying over a mouse!”Even when the police officer put her in the police car, Xu Yao was still cursing. ”

Xu Yao regretted it.

She really regretted it.

She shouldn’t have been so obsessed back then. Why did she go to Mi Chen’s appointment.

“If she didn’t go to the appointment, she wouldn’t have been tempted by Mi Chen and got into her trap. ”

It was all caused by Mi Chen!

“Originally, she just wanted to marry he ziteng in peace and be the mistress of the He family. ”

“But later, somehow, things turned out that she wanted to kill he ziteng... ”

Xu Yao used her handcuffed hands to hug her head and cry bitterly.

“The policeman at the side said coldly, “If you knew this would happen, why did you do it in the first place!” ”

To the policeman.

These were the tears of a crocodile.

“If Xu Yao had not been caught red-handed, then the person who was crying now would be the victim. ”

Such a person was not worthy of sympathy at all.

On the other side.

Father and mother Xu were directly chased out of the villa.

“Xu Chaonan stood in front of them. “In the future, I won’t have brothers and sisters like you and you won’t have a sister like me. Let’s cut all ties and never see each other again!” ”

“If they continued to cut ties, they would only end up in a mess. ” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“If it were not for the indulgence of her brother and sister-in-law, Xu Yao would not have ended up like this. ”

“”Chaonan, I’m your biological brother!”Father Xu looked at Xu Chaonan. “It’s fine that you didn’t save Yaoyao, but do you still have to treat your biological brother and sister-in-law like this?” ”

“Father Xu never thought that one day, they would be chased out of the house by Xu Chaonan. ”

“All along, Xu Chaonan had been a sister who didn’t mind working hard. ”

“Even if the Xu family’s parents interfered in her finding a boyfriend, she didn’t discover anything. ”

“To the Xu family’s parents, Xu Chaonan was just a marionette, a tool to earn money. ”

“But now, this marionette suddenly had its own thoughts and broke away from their control. How could they accept this? ”

No.

No.

“They could not be chased out of the house by Xu Chaonan. If they were chased out, how would they survive in the future. ”

Mother Xu was so scared that her face turned pale.

“All these years, she had been used to being a rich lady. Every day, she would be with those rich ladies. She would have afternoon tea, play cards, and brag at the same time. Her life was very carefree. ”

“If she was kicked out, would she still be able to live like this? ”

“”Superman, you are of the same lineage as your brother. Even if your bones are broken, your tendons are still attached. You Can’t be so heartless!”Mother Xu continued, “We are not leaving! We are not leaving! This is the Xu family. Even if we die, your brother and I will die here!” ”
