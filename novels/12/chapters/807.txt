“Chapter 808: 177: serves her right, Feng Xianxian goes to jail! 5”

Translator: 549690339

The police immediately went to retrieve the surveillance footage from that day.

“In order to make a mistake, they watched from 2 pm to 5 pm, but they still did not see Feng Xianxian and Gao di meet.”

“Did you remember wrongly?”

“”No! I didn’t remember wrongly!”Feng Xianxian was a little flustered, and continued, “Is it because the surveillance footage is broken?””

“The policewoman next to her said, “If the surveillance camera at the intersection is broken, then the surveillance camera at the coffee shop across the street will definitely be able to capture it! Captain Wang, why don’t we check the surveillance camera at the coffee shop?””

“Okay.”Captain Wang nodded.

A few policemen went to the coffee shop to negotiate with the owner of the coffee shop to get the surveillance camera at the coffee shop.

But.

“After checking for two whole hours, they still couldn’t find the surveillance camera of Feng Xianxian and Gao Di’s meeting.”

“When she found out that there was no surveillance footage of Gao di meeting her in the cafe, Feng Xianxian was on the verge of breaking down.”

How could this be?

“Feng Xianxian tried her best to calm herself down and said, “Oh right, there’s also a call record. I called Gao Di! You can check the call record!””

“At this moment, the call record became the only evidence that she and Gao di knew each other.”

Unfortunately.

The result still disappointed Feng Xianxian.

“After a few police officers went to check, they didn’t find any phone records between her and Gao di in Feng Xianxian’s phone records. Instead, they found records of Feng Xianxian buying medicine in Feng Xianxian’s shopping account.”

Everything was accusing Feng Xianxian of being the mastermind.

No one threatened her at all.

What Gao Di.

What recording.

It was all her own doing.

The police transferred Feng Xianxian to the Supreme People’s Court in Beijing that afternoon.

“After the trial, Feng Xianxian was sentenced to 12 years in prison.”

“When she heard the news, Old Mrs. Lin was very happy, but she was still a little angry.”

“Feng Xianxian had done so many wrong things, and in the end, she was only sentenced to 12 years in prison.”

“But on the other hand, it was quite worth it.”

Feng Xianxian was only twenty years old this year.

“Twelve years later, she would be thirty-two years old.” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“At that time, what else could she do?”

“Old Mrs. Lin sat in her wheelchair and turned to look at Auntie Wang. “Is scorching hot at home today?”Currently, although all the toxins in old Mrs. Lin’s body had been removed, her legs were crippled.”

She could only spend the rest of her life in a wheelchair.

Retribution.

This was her retribution.

“Feng Xianxian’s retribution was twelve years in prison, and her retribution was crippled legs.”

“”Today is Sunday. Ah Ze and zhongruo are both at home,”Auntie Wang said.”

“Push me to the east courtyard.”

“Okay.”

“Ten minutes later, Auntie Wang pushed Old Mrs. Lin to the east courtyard.”

The courtyard was very peaceful.

Lin Jincheng and Ye Shu were watering the flowers and plants.

Old Lady Lin’s eyes were slightly red when she saw this scene. How come she had never realized the beauty of life before?

“Lin Jincheng and ye Shu were such a good couple, and Lin Ze and ye Zhuo were such good grandsons and granddaughters. Moreover, she was dissatisfied with them all day long, and she even thought of ways to break them up.”

It was all her fault.

All of this was her fault!

“If she had lived a peaceful life, there wouldn’t have been so much trouble.”

Old Lady Lin was very regretful now.

But what was the use of regretting?

These things had already happened.

Old Lady Lin closed her eyes and looked up at Lin Jincheng. “Jincheng.”

Lin Jincheng didn’t notice Old Lady Lin. It wasn’t until Old Lady Lin opened her mouth that he knew Old Lady Lin had come over. “Mom.”

Ye Shu also walked over. “Can I get you a glass of water?”

Old Lady Lin shook her head and smiled. “No need to trouble yourself. I’m not thirsty.”

“After saying that, old lady lin continued, “I came over today to apologize to your family of four. I’m sorry. It was my fault. I was blind in the past. I’ve let down your family of four, and I’ve let down Zhuo Zhuo!””

“”Zhuo Zhuo is a good granddaughter, but I’m not a good grandmother. I know it’s too late to say anything now, but I still want to personally apologize to all of you.””

“Lin Jincheng sighed. “Mom, if I knew this would happen, why did you do it in the first place?””

“If not for this incident, Old Madam Lin would probably have been deceived by Feng Xianxian for the rest of her life.”

“Although Old Madam Lin was also a victim, Lin Jincheng could not sympathize with her.”

“If Old Lady Lin had listened to her advice, she would not have ended up in this State!”

Old Lady Lin had not only nearly harmed herself.

“If ye Zao had not intervened, she would have even implicated the entire Lin family.”

“Old Lady Lin also sighed. “Oh right, where are Zao and Ah Ze? I want to personally apologize to the two children.””
