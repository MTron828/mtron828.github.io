Chapter 102: 075: dinner, thousand miles of gratitude! 2

“I’ll go get it for you.”

A moment later, dog two brought the laptop to Lin Ze.

Lin Ze took the laptop and came to the French window. He sat on the floor and kept typing on the computer keyboard with his hands.

Fat tiger asked curiously, “What do you think brother Ze is doing? Is He being mysterious?”

“WHO KNOWS!”Li Wen spread his hands helplessly.

Lin Ze was always so mysterious, and the three of them never went to the end to get to the bottom of it.

About ten minutes later, Lin Ze came back with his laptop. He pressed the keyboard with one hand and chewed on a bun with the other.

The other three chatted on their own and did not disturb Lin Ze.

After breakfast, the three of them carried their school bags and went home. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Lin Ze had just returned home when he ran into Feng Qianhua.

Feng Qianhua asked with concern, “Where did Ah Ze go last night? I heard from your grandmother that you didn’t come back all night.”

“Thank you for your concern, Auntie Feng.”Lin Ze’s tone was very indifferent.

Feng Qianhua continued, “Ah Ze, you are now at a sensitive age where you are curious about everything. In the future, try not to spend the night outside and don’t spend the night outside. Otherwise, your grandmother and I will be very worried about you.”

Did this Feng Qianhua really think that she was the mistress of the Lin Family?

Lin Ze’s eyes showed a hint of impatience.

At this moment, Old Mrs. Lin’s voice came from inside. “Ah Ze, come in for a moment.”

“Coming,”Lin ze replied and walked inside.

Old Mrs. Lin sat on the sofa, her expression a little ugly. “Where did you go last night?”

“Grandma, I was at a classmate’s house last night.”

“At which classmate’s house?”

Lin Ze didn’t answer.

“Is it that dog two?”Old Mrs. Lin continued to ask.

“Yes.”Lin Ze nodded.

Old Mrs. Lin slammed the teacup in her hand onto the table. The boiling hot tea splashed directly onto the back of her hand.

“Grandma!”Lin Ze was shocked and quickly handed a tissue to old Mrs. Lin to intervene.

Seeing this.

Old Lady Lin Sighed, “Ah Ze! How many times has Grandma Told You? Grandma doesn’t interfere and doesn’t object to you making friends. However, birds of a feather flock together. Who is dog two? Who Are You? Being with such a person will only lower your status!”

Lin Ze’s hand paused. “Grandma, he is my friend!”

“He’s not your friend!”Old Lady Lin said angrily, “He’s not from the same world as you!”

That Buttface’s parents were just ordinary white-collar workers. They bought a house in Beijing and took out a loan.

What right did such a person have to be Lin Ze’s friend?

Poor people were surrounded by poor people.

At that time, Lin Ze would be surrounded by a bunch of poor people.

Back then, she didn’t control Lin Jincheng properly, which resulted in Lin Jincheng not knowing the principle of birds of a feather flock together. In the end, he got together with Ye Shu...

The door wasn’t right, the family wasn’t right!

He had a child out of wedlock!

If Lin Ze continued like this, sooner or later, he would follow in Lin Jincheng’s footsteps.

“Grandma, Buttface is my friend. No matter how rich or poor, everyone in this world is equal! I hope you don’t look at him differently!”

“You don’t even listen to Grandma?”Old Mrs. Lin looked at Lin Ze with heartache.

She remembered that Lin Ze was very cute and obedient when he was young.

Lin Ze would do whatever she said.

Since when did Lin ze start to disobey his grandma?

Lin Ze looked at Old Mrs. Lin and said seriously, “Grandma, I’m 18 years old now. I can tell right from wrong. I know what kind of friends to make and what kind of friends to avoid.”

“If you listen to Grandma, you can cut ties with that dog two!”

“I’m sorry, I can’t do that.”

Old Mrs. Lin was as angry as Lin Ze was indifferent.

This reminded her of Ye Shu.

If Lin Ze’s mother was Feng Qianhua, he definitely wouldn’t disobey her like this.

“Grandma, if there’s nothing else, I’ll go back to my room first.”After saying that, Lin Ze turned around and left.

Looking at Lin Ze’s back, Old Mrs. Lin was so angry that her face turned pale.

Feng Qianhua walked in from outside and comforted old Mrs. Lin, “Aunt Lin, ze is still a child. He will only understand many things when he’s older. Please don’t be angry.”

Old Mrs. Lin Sighed, “This child is getting more and more unreasonable now. He spends all day with those shady people. Sooner or later, he will be led astray by those people! Xianxian is still sensible. She has never worried you since she was young.”
