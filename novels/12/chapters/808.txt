“I’ll go get them.”Ye Shu turned around and walked into the house.

“After a while, Ye Shu walked out of the house with Lin Ze and ye Zao. ”

“Old Mrs. Lin looked at the two of them and said with slightly red eyes, “Zao Zao, Ah Ze, Grandma has let you two down...” ” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Ye Zao didn’t have much expression on his face, “You know very well what you’ve done. It would be too hypocritical of me to say that it’s okay. I hope that in the days to come, you’ll remember this lesson. Don’t forget the pain after you’ve healed your scars.” ”

Although Old Mrs. Lin had already crippled a pair of legs.

Ye Zhongrao still could not forgive her for what she had done.

What was done could not be undone.

“Sometimes, what was done was done. ”

“Old Lady Lin nodded. “Don’t worry, Zhuo Zhuo. There won’t be a next time.” ”

“After saying a few words to Old Lady Lin, ye Zhuo and Lin Ze returned to their room. ”

“Old Lady Lin looked at Lin Jin Cheng. “Jin Cheng, can you help me contact Qingxuan?” ”

“A wary look appeared in Lin Jin Cheng’s eyes. After all, Old Lady Lin had been very dissatisfied with Xia Xiaoman and Lin Qingxuan. ”

“Why are you looking for fourth brother?”

“”Jincheng, don’t misunderstand. I just want to apologize to Qingxuan.”After so many things had happened, old Mrs. Lin had thought it through. “It was all my fault in the past. I shouldn’t have stopped the two of them from being lovers.” ”

Lin Jincheng somewhat doubted the authenticity of old Mrs. Lin’s words.

“After all, she had said the same thing to him twenty years ago. ”

“That year, in order to lure him back from Yunjing. ”

“Old Lady Lin pretended to agree to her and ye Shu’s matter over the phone. After he returned, Old Lady Lin fell out with him and locked him in the room. ”

“Old Lady Lin saw the suspicion in Lin Jincheng’s heart, she continued, “Jincheng, don’t worry. I really didn’t lie to you. Xiao Man is a good woman. I trust Qingxuan’s judgment. Right, is that child lizi here? You can let me meet her too! From today onwards, Lizi is my biological granddaughter!” ”

“Thinking of how an Lizi had never given an Lizi a good look in the past few days when she was in the Lin family, Old Lady Lin felt very regretful. ”

“In the past, she had gone too far. ”

“In the future, she wouldn’t. ”

“Lin Jin Cheng said, “Lizi had something to do at school and didn’t come back this week.” ”

“Hearing that, Old Lady Lin nodded regretfully and continued, “Then can you call Qingxuan? I want to apologize to them over the phone.” ”

Lin Jincheng hesitated for a moment.

“Three minutes later, he still dialed Lin Qingxuan’s number. ”

“But unfortunately, Lin Qingxuan didn’t pick up the phone. ”

“Old Lady Lin continued, “Since fourth brother isn’t picking up the phone, then forget it.” ”

“After saying that, Old Lady Lin turned to look at Auntie Wang. “Let’s go back.” ”

“Okay.”Auntie Wang nodded.

“Looking at Old Lady Lin’s back, Lin Jincheng turned to look at Ye Shu. “Ah Shu, do you think mom really knows her mistake this time?” ”

Ye Shu retracted her gaze. “It’s hard to say now.”

“After all, after Feng Qianhua’s incident was exposed last time, Old Lady Lin had a look of regret on her face. ”

It was just that.

She had not regretted it for three days before her true nature was revealed.

Ye Shu did not have any expectations for Old Lady Lin now.

In the western courtyard.

“After sister-in-law Wang pushed Old Lady Lin back, the servants brought the bird’s nest to Old Lady Lin. ”

“Old Lady Lin raised her hand to reject. “From today onwards, I’m a vegetarian.” ”

“She had already done too many wrong things in the first half of her life, and she wanted to use the second half of her life to make up for it. ”

“Hopefully, it was not too late. ”

...

Sunday.

“In the morning, after Ye Zhuo sent the last design to nine Li, he left the house. ”

“Just as he left the house, he saw a low-profile Maybach parked there. ”

“In front of the car door, there was a tall figure leaning against it. His eyes were slightly lowered, and he could vaguely see a string of bright red Buddhist beads in his hand. ”

Ye Zhuo walked over. “When did you get here?”

“Just now.”Cen Shaoqing put the Buddha beads back between his fingers and opened the door of the passenger seat.

Ye Zhuo sat in the car.

Cen Shaoqing also got into the car from the other side.

“”Leader, have you thought about where to eat?”Cen Shaoqing tilted his head and looked at Ye Zhuo. ”

A face filled with the vicissitudes of time suddenly appeared in front of ye Zhuo’s eyes. “Let’s Go for half a month?”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

Soon.

The car arrived at half a month.

“The half a month was still the same half a month, but compared to the first time they came here, the lilies in the courtyard bloomed even more vigorously. ”

“Just as the two of them walked in, Aunt Lang came out to welcome them. “Shaoqing is here.” ”

“Aunt Lang.”

“Aunt Lang turned to look at Ye Zao, a smile blossoming on the corner of her mouth. “Zao Zao is here too!” ”

“Do not know how, as long as see ye Zhuo, Lang aunt had a kind of inexplicable intimacy. ”
