The prescription that they took from the upper class society was definitely not a problem.

Auntie Wang trusted this prescription very much.

“Otherwise, she wouldn’t have bought the prescription back so quickly. ”

“Can it really cure my illness?”Su Qiang’s eyes lit up.

“He had been suffering from diabetes for a very long time. Because it was too serious, not only did he have to refrain from talking, but his body was also very weak and couldn’t do heavy work. ”

“He did not have much education, so he could only do some physical work. Ever since he got sick, he had been resting at home. Fortunately, his wife was virtuous. All these years, she had been working as a servant in the Zhao family to supplement her life and had never complained! ”

Su Qiang dreamed of curing his own diabetes. He wanted to contribute to the family and take on the responsibility of a husband and a father!

“Unfortunately, there was no specific medicine that could cure diabetes at the moment. ”

“Now that he heard that this prescription could cure diabetes, Su Qiang was extremely excited. ”

It was as if someone who was terminally ill suddenly saw hope.

“”It’s true!”Auntie Wang nodded. “I think on this prescription, if you drink it three times a day for seven consecutive days, you can see the effect!” ”

“”Okay, then I want to try it. I must try it!” ”

“Auntie Wang poured the medicine into the bowl. “Drink it while it’s hot. Xiao Qing, go get a candy for your dad.” ”

“Okay.”Su Xiaoqing ran outside to get the candy.

“Su Qiang took the bowl. “Actually, there’s no need for sugar. I can drink it.”The bitterness he had experienced over the years was much more bitter than this bowl of Chinese medicine. ”

“Auntie Wang could hear the hidden meaning in Su Qiang’s words. She smiled and said, “Eat a candy! In the future, our life will definitely be like candy, sweet and sweet.” ”

“Okay.”Su Qiang nodded.

In the coffee shop.

“Zhao Xueyin walked into the coffee shop and went to the reserved seat. “Second aunt, why did you call me over in such a hurry?” ”

Who was sitting opposite Zhao Xueyin other than Ma Jiayue?

“Ma jiayue smiled and said, “Xueyin, you have to treat me to this cup of coffee today! Otherwise, I won’t be able to help you!” ”

“Zhao Xue Yin narrowed her eyes. “Second aunt, your niece is stupid. If you have anything to say, just say it. Don’t beat around the bush with me.” ”

“”You’re Stupid?”Ma Jia Yue glanced at Zhao Xue Yin. “If you’re stupid, there won’t be any smart people in the financial world!” ”

“If Zhao Xue Yin was stupid, she wouldn’t have achieved what she did today. ”

“”Second aunt,”Zhao Xue Yin smiled and said, “Don’t beat around the bush with me!” ”

“”Okay, okay, okay! I Won’t beat around the bush with you!”Ma Jia Yue then told Zhao Xue Yin about what happened last night, “Ye Zao is in big trouble this time! I just called her, and sister-in-law Wang has already started to let her husband take medicine! Just wait! Something will happen sooner or later!” ”

“”Are you so sure that something will happen?”If something happened to Ye Zao, she couldn’t ask for more. ”

She was just afraid that something unexpected would happen again.

“Ma Jia Yue was a little speechless and said, “You still don’t believe in your second aunt’s medical skills? Even if you don’t believe in your second aunt’s medical skills, you should believe in your grandfather!” ”

Ma Jia Yue’s father was called Ma Da bin.

“When he was still alive, everyone called him Sai Bian Que. He was a famous godly doctor in the financial world. ”

“Although Ma Jia Yue didn’t practice medicine, her medical skills were not inferior to that of a proper traditional Chinese medicine doctor. ”

“Zhao Xue smiled and said, “It’s not that I don’t trust you. I just feel that based on ye Zhuo’s character, she shouldn’t be able to do such an unreliable thing.”To let a patient take a problematic medicine.., wasn’t this like shooting herself in the foot? ”

Ye Zhuo wasn’t stupid!

Would she do such a self-destructive thing?

“Ma Jia Yue narrowed her eyes. “If she was reliable, she wouldn’t be able to boast about building a space mothership! Who does she think she is? Is she that Miracle Doctor Ye who cures cancer? I think she just likes to be in the limelight!” ” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

How could ye Zhuo compare to Miracle Doctor Ye?

There was no comparison at all!

“Hearing this, Zhao Xueyin felt that what Ma Jianyue said made sense. ”

Ye Zhuo must have done this to gain a foothold.

She had just returned to the financial world and her foundation was still shallow.

She needed the support of others.

“At present, she had already received the support of the lawyer and Jiang Xiaoyu. ”

“If it wasn’t for Ma Jianyue who was well-versed in medical science, the Zhou family would probably have been deceived by Ye Zhuo. ”

Right!

That must be the case.

“Zhao Xueyin picked up the cup and took a sip of coffee before asking, “Second aunt, will ye Zao’s prescription aggravate the patient’s condition?” ”

“Ma jiayue replied, “Aggravating the patient’s condition is still considered light! If it’s more serious, it could kill a person!” ”

Ma Jiayue really didn’t spout nonsense.

The two herbs that ye Zao had added to the prescription might not even dare to try so easily while Old Master Ma was still alive.
