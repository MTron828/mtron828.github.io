“Chapter 1641: 345: Trash, Tang Xue is expelled from the base. 2”

Translator: 549690339

“”Everyone, please.”Cen Shaoqing made a welcoming gesture.”

“The few of them followed Cen Shaoqing and walked up the stage. There were only a few people, but there were thousands of them.”

“”Clap, clap, clap –“”

The scene was filled with applause.

“Seeing ye Zao and the others walk over, the Chinese leaders on the stage stood up first and applauded to welcome them. When the leaders of the various countries and Dr. Cara saw that everyone stood up, they had no choice but to stand up and applaud together, to welcome the return of the hero.”

“Cen Shaoqing walked to the front of the rostrum, dialed the microphone, and opened his thin lips slightly. “I now announce that the 5.18 Chinese aircraft carrier launch ceremony has been successfully held!””

Clap Clap Clap —

Another round of deafening applause.

“Cen Shaoqing slowly raised his right hand. Although it was a very simple action, it successfully quieted the scene down.”

“”Dr. YC and her team, including Dr. Warne, Dr. Millet, the flying universe team, and all the staff of the CEN base in Area C, have successfully built the world’s first aircraft carrier faster than the speed of light! Landing on the eight planets was only the first step for mankind to conquer the universe. “In the coming days, Dr. YC will lead her team to create more miracles in the world” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“”The members who will board Neptune with Dr. YC this time are: Dr. Hua’en, Zhao Hua’en, Captain Chen Hao of the Feiyu team, and Cen Jiang, Cen he, Cen Hu, Cen Hai, Tang Mi, and Yu Zifei of the Cen family base in Area C! “They are all heroes of China, Heroes of the people! “Heroes of the world!””

Applause grew louder and louder.

No one had expected that ye Zao could really build an aircraft carrier that surpassed the speed of light. They had never expected that ye Zao could successfully land on an aircraft carrier!

“One had to know that before this, everyone had come to watch the launch ceremony as if they were watching a show.”

But Ye Zao had done it!

“Below the stage, Tang Xue’s face turned pale.”

Dream on.

This must be a dream.

“If all of this was true, then what would she do?”

“During this period of time, she had done her best for Country C, all for the sake of obtaining the management rights of the CEN base.”

But now...

“The aircraft carrier project had succeeded, and country C had become the loser. She was on the same side as country C, and country C’s failure meant that she had also failed.”

How could country C fail!

Country C was a well-known technological power!

“If country C failed, wouldn’t she become a joke?”

“At that moment, everyone around Tang Xue cheered.”

“Except for Tang Xue, Bai Yun, and Tang, who was sitting next to them.”

“Tang originally thought that Tang Xue would win glory for the Tang family this time, get the management rights of the CEN base, and slap Tang Mi in the face.”

She didn’t expect that.

She didn’t expect that the aircraft carrier plan would actually succeed.

“Not only did it succeed, but Tang Mi, that little b * TCH, had also followed the aircraft carrier to Neptune, becoming the first person to land on Neptune.”

How could tang swallow this grievance! !

There was also Bai Yun. She had almost thought of the days when she would become the manager of the CEN base.

She had not expected ye Zhuo to return.

“The aircraft carrier was still floating in midair. Dr. Cara narrowed his eyes and lowered the microphone for a moment, then he said, “Fifth Master Cen, Dr. YC, none of us have been to Neptune before. We can’t believe that you did indeed take a light-speed aircraft carrier to Neptune just by listening to your side of the story. Please provide us with evidence to prove that you did indeed take an aircraft carrier to Neptune.”. “...””

“As soon as he said that, the comments on the bullet screen changed completely.”

“”Yes, yes, yes! Professor Cara is right. Let YC Show us the evidence! Didn’t YC say that everyone could have their diamond freedom? Where are the diamonds? Where are the samples collected from Neptune?””

“Show us the evidence!”

“Maybe landing on Neptune is a scam!”

“There isn’t even any evidence. It must be a scam!”

“Liar!”

Ye Zhuo looked back at Tang Mi.

“Tang mi immediately understood. She smiled and said, “Professor Cara, please look over there!””

Professor Cara turned his head to look at the place Tang Mi was pointing at.

“The aircraft carrier slowly landed in a storage room. The door to the storage room was opened, and a colorful light shone out of it.”

The storage room was filled with dazzling diamonds.

“Not only were there common diamonds, but there were also collection-level pink and green diamonds!”

They were all colorful.

“Tang mi continued, “Those are the diamonds we brought back from Neptune. There are twenty tons in total.””

Twenty tons!

It must be noted that a diamond mine could only produce two to three tons of diamonds on average.
