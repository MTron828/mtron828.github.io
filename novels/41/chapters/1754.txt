Chapter 1755 – Vermillion Bird

Lu Yu and Lu Lán were the strongest amongst the nine maids but completely lost to Lin Yun. With just Kill Zone, Lin Yun refreshed everyone’s understanding of his music dao. They also realized that Yan Tianchen wasn’t lying when he said Lin Yun didn’t give it his all during the Nirvana Banquet.

“That’s Kill Zone?” The Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion’s pavilion master muttered to himself, and he exchanged a gaze with the elders beside him. He could also see the shock in their eyes.

They interacted with musicians often, and Kill Zone was a pretty common ancient score that the various musical houses and sects had a copy of. But they had never heard someone playing in Lin Yun’s manner before. It was simply unheard of.

“Young master!” Lu Yu and Lu Lán’s faces were pale with shame as they retreated behind Mei Zihua.

“It’s fine. It’s worth it since I can hear such a version of the Kill Zone.” Mei Zihua smiled. Before the music ended, he already expected that Lu Yu and Lu Lán would lose, and it was just a matter of time. Both sides played Kill Zone, but Lin Yun’s version was much better than his two maids.

Donned in his blue robe, Mei Zihua stood with his hands behind him and smiled, “It’s no wonder why you’re first on the Nirvana Banquet. Not bad. You’re a lot stronger than your senior brother. But you’re still inferior when compared to me, and it won’t be easy to take revenge for your senior brother…

“What’s the matter? You don’t believe me?”

Seeing Lin Yun didn’t say a word, Mei Zihua sat down with ten fingers on the zither.

On the other hand, Lin Yun remained seated before his zither and reached out with one hand, signifying Mei Zihua to go on. He could tell that Mei Zihua was strong, judging from how he heavily injured Yan Tianchen with one string. So Lin Yun wouldn’t look down on Mei Zihua because the latter might be stronger than he’d imagined.

He initially didn’t want to come to Dual Moon Lake. But since he was here and had already sat down, no one could chase him away. Mei Zihua could only dream about wanting his Three-Lives Fruit. The Ten Musical Clans might have a long legacy, but Lin Yun still had a lot of trump cards.

“Not bad!” Mei Zihua smiled and repeated what he did with Yan Tianchen by pulling one zither string with one finger. The zither began to tremble, but there was no music from it.

This scene immediately made the faces of everyone at Dual Moon Lake pale, and they quickly dashed towards the lakeside. As for those already on the lakeside, their faces changed and retreated ten-odd miles away.

They had been standing there previously, and they suffered considerable injuries because of it. So no one dared to look down on Mei Zihua when they saw he would make a move again.

“Senior Brother was defeated by this move previously, and it’s hard to block.” Lin Wan said in a concerned tone while standing beside Luo Shuyi and Yue Weiwei. Beside her, Yue Weiwei’s face gradually became grave because she could sense the boundless mental energy gathered on that zither string.

This scene made everyone nervous. They had already witnessed Mei Zihua’s strength earlier and didn’t know how Lin Yun would deal with it.

A smear of surprise flashed across Lin Yun’s pupils. When Mei Zihua continued to pull the zither string back, he could clearly sense an invisible pressure spreading out and becoming stronger.

“Your senior brother was defeated by this earlier, so I’m curious about how you’ll face it.” Mei Zihua squinted his eyes with a smile. He was confident in himself and had pride written on his face.

But Lin Yun had no change on his face as he also used a finger to hook on a zither string before slowly pulling it. The aura released from them grew even stronger when the strings were fully pulled.

Lin Yun and Mei Zihua exchanged gazes, and their pupils were cold. A buzzing noises echoed throughout heaven and earth when they released the strings. As heaven shattered, the layers of heaven began to shatter until the sixth layer.

This instantly caused an uproar in the surroundings, with everyone’s mouths widened. They were shocked by how Lin Yun and Mei Zihua could shatter the sixth layer of heaven. Mei Zihua shone with dazzling radiance, and the light he gave practically enveloped the entire Dual Moon Lake. But Lin Yun wasn’t any weaker than him, having thunderstorms surrounding him, and the golden human in his sword ocean started emitting dazzling sword rays. When Lin Yun circulated his sword intent, his forehead became heated.

Lin Yun and Mei Zihua looked like two bright moons on Dual Moon Lake. When they released the zither strings, visible shockwaves spread out from the two. When the shockwaves collided, an explosion occurred on Dual Moon Lake, with water geysers soaring to the sky and huge rising waves. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Without any hesitation, they began to start strumming on their zithers. There wasn’t any skill but a brutal clash in strength, like two experts clashing their fists. Under this breathtaking bombardment, Mei Zihua was the first to make a move.

Soaring to the sky, a flute appeared in Mei Zihua’s hand, and he started playing it. His flute music was like a waterfall pouring from the sky, but what shocked everyone even more was that another Mei Zihua was still playing the zither on a stage.

This instantly made everyone recall Mei Zihua’s title, Saint Hands. They instantly understood where he got his title from, and the afterimage he left behind was like plums emitting a clear fragrance. Plums also flew out from the zither, and his flute music was like snow. When the two melodies combined, snow and plum also fused.

The artistic concept in Mei Zihua’s melody completely suppressed Lin Yun. But Lin Yun was calm and composure as he executed the Divine Phoenix Touch. As his afterimages overlapped, an afterimage played the Thunderstorm Zither while the other played the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute.

It was also a combination of zither and flute melodies. The phenomenon summoned by Mei Zihua was plum petals, while Lin Yun was a dragon and phoenix. He played the Heavenly Dragon Score with the Thunderstorm Zither, and the Divine Phoenix Score with the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute. At the same time, he also circulated the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon.

Mei Zihua was surprised when he saw this scene, before his afterimage playing the zither suddenly changed, and a forest of plum trees appeared on Dual Moon Lake. Like that, the heavenly dragon and phoenix clashed with the snow and plum petals.

As a wisp of flame blazed within Mei Zihua’s pupils, the Vermilion Mark on his forehead bloomed, with the plum petals and snowflakes starting to fuse. This was like a fusion between blood and water, and a Vermilion Bird flew out from Dual Moon Lake.

When the Vermilion Bird appeared, the sky shattered, and the Vermilion Bird Constellation beyond the thirty-six layers of heaven was attracted. The Vermilion Bird Constellation was one of the four sovereign constellations in the Divine Dragon Era, and the Vermilion Bird suddenly opened its eyes. The thirty-six layers of heaven shattered, and Mei Zihua gave off a sacred aura.

This made Lin Yun groan with his five organs trembling before he threw out a mouthful of blood. His melody was suddenly cut off, making him suffer a backlash. The afterimages he created also disappeared.

But this scene made Lin Yun shocked. He couldn’t understand how Mei Zihua managed to accomplish this. Did he have a Sovereign Constellation, or did he use a Sovereign Saint Artifact? After all, he had summoned a small portion of the Azure Dragon Constellation with the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella but also suffered severe injuries.

On the other hand, Mei Zihua was having an easier time because he only made the Vermilion Bird Constellation open its eyes. But even so, it instantly suppressed him.

Mei Zihua smiled, and his afterimages of playing the two instruments shattered as if they had never existed.

“Lin Xiao, you can be proud to have forced me this far.” Mei Zihua shut his eyes and shook his head while playing the zither. When his music reached the peak, the Vermilion Bird in the sky spat out a mouthful of crimson flames.

This scene changed Lin Yun’s face, and he had no choice but to dodge it. When the flame landed on the lake, it created a huge crater, and he would be heavily injured even if he wasn’t incinerated to ashes if he stayed behind.

Meanwhile, Mei Zihua still wore a smile and played his music. When his melody reached a peak again, the Vermilion Bird breathed out another mouthful of divine flames. Mei Zihua’s hands were dancing on the zither, and his hands were overlapping, which forced Lin Yun to keep dodging. He could only receive a one-sided beating from Mei Zihua.

Under the gaze of the Sovereign Constellation, Mei Zihua stood out in his blue robe, shocking everyone by the lakeside. After all, that was a Sovereign Constellation they were talking about, and Mei Zihua’s music actually managed to lure it out. Just thinking about it made their scalps go numb. They didn’t dare to imagine how terrifying Mei Zihua’s attainment in music dao had reached, and it was no wonder why he could look down on everyone else's music dao.

“This fellow is a little terrifying…” The lips of Ye Chen from the Divine Phoenix Mountain twitched, and his face was ugly. He was previously furious because of Mei Zihua’s arrogance. But now that he looked at it, Mei Zihua did have the capability to be arrogant and comment on their music dao.

“Perhaps this is the foundation of the Ten Musical Clans.” Liu Ruochen sighed, shaking his head.

When Mei Zihua repeated his song nine times, the Vermilion Bird in the sky spread its wings apart, and the surrounding space began to distort under tremendous pressure. With the space distorting, there was no way Lin Yun could avoid this before the Vermilion Bird breathed out a mouthful of divine flames towards Lin Yun. Then again, the Vermilion Bird was a phenomenon created by music and not an actual Vermilion Bird.

But even so, this still made Lin Yun suffer some injuries with a trace of blood dripping down his lips. He was like a broken kite falling before he dropped to one knee.

“You’re strong, but it hasn’t been long since you started practicing music dao. So there’s no way you can compete with me.” Mei Zihua said indifferently.

Wiping the blood off his lips, Lin Yun looked at the blood in his hand before raising his head with a smile, “You’re right. But your aloofness is really annoying.”

“That’s how I am from birth. I’m invincible amongst those of the same generation, and you don’t understand my loneliness…” Mei Zihua waved his hand and got a maid to pour a cup of wine for him. Taking a small sip, he continued, “It’s not embarrassing to admit your defeat against me because you’re not the first.”

The lips of everyone on the lakeside twitched, and their faces were ugly because Mei Zihua was too arrogant.

“Then I’m afraid you’ll be disappointed because this was just a warm-up!” Lin Yun stood up and waved his hand. When the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute returned to his hand, sword intent swept out from him when he raised his head. In the beginning, everyone wasn’t too bothered because they already sensed that Lin Yun was a swordsman, including Mei Zihua.

But when his flute melody swept out, Mei Zihua’s cup and several strands of his hair shattered into pieces. When Mei Zihua raised his head, he was surprised because Lin Yun grasped the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent!
