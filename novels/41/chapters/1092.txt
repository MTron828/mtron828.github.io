Chapter 1093 - He’s Not Qualified!

Aside from having a pavilion, the Wind Bank Residence also had a large river behind the courtyard filled with spiritual energy. It flowed from the sect master’s mountain, which gave everyone nearby a noble status.

The reason why Lin Yun could stay here was all thanks to Feng Jue. When Lin Yun sat in the courtyard, the spiritual array began to absorb the spiritual energy in the surrounding atmosphere. Closing his eyes, Lin Yun slowly digested all of his insights from the final battle.

He mainly focused on the battle with the Imperial Feather Realm Son, who was the strongest among the ten Realm Sons. If it wasn’t for the fact that he was lucky, he might have lost to the Imperial Feather Realm Son. Paired with the holy spirit martial techniques left behind by the latter, Lin Yun had lots of comprehension from the fight.

The Imperial Dragon Seal was the secret technique of the Dragon Clan, which the Imperial Feather Realm Son managed to cultivate thanks to the Flame Dragon’s Heart. The same was true for the Heavenly Meteorite Fist because the Imperial Feather Realm Son fused his flame intent into it.

As insights flashed in Lin Yun’s mind, his sword dao gradually improved. So his sky sword intent in complete mastery became a lot more robust. The highest stage of the sky sword intent was one with heaven and earth, which meant merging sword intent and nature together. However, Lin Yun didn’t have a complete fusion and was at the bottleneck of his sky sword intent. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Half a day later, the sword intent in Lin Yun’s eyes grew a lot sharper.

“As I expected. My sword intent has improved, but it’s still the sky sword intent. I’m still far from reaching the fourth grade…” Lin Yun muttered, but he wasn’t too disappointed because he had expected it. He knew that it wouldn’t be that easy to grasp the fourth-grade sword intent. After all, Feng Jue was still stuck in the fourth grade.

However, Lin Yun was certain that he would break through the sky sword intent. For now, he just needed to focus on his cultivation and sword sutra. Otherwise, he would run into trouble in three days.

Waving his hand over the ground, Lin Yun retrieved the Divine Astral Pellets from his interspatial pouch. If the other disciples of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect were here, their jaws would drop in disbelief. Lin Yun was simply too wealthy.

After all, ordinary inner disciples would only get about ten Divine Astral Pellets a month. Although core disciples would have more, they wouldn’t get such a terrifying amount. Even Ye Ziling could only receive roughly 400-500 Divine Astral Pellets.

Lin Yun calculated that he only needed about 3,000 Divine Astral Pellets to make a breakthrough.

“Lin Yun, you’re finally going to make a breakthrough in your sword sutra? Is it because you feel gratitude towards me?” Lil’ Purple became excited in the subconscious space and continued, “Remember to leave the Azure Dragon True Bone for me. If I’m in a good mood, I can consider giving you some benefits.”

“We’ll see.” Lin Yun didn’t answer her because he had to reach the sixteenth stage in the Iris Sword Sutra sooner or later in order to find out about the secrets of the sword box. He just wasn’t certain if he should give the Azure Dragon True Bone to Lil’ Purple because Lin Yun was cautious of her.

Over the next three days, Lin Yun finally managed to make a breakthrough in the Iris Sword Sutra and his cultivation thanks to his insights from the Heavenly Path. When he circulated the Iris Sword Sutra, an Iris Flower bloomed beneath him that devoured the surrounding Divine Astral Pellets.

At the same time, the Demonic Astral Flowers in his aura oceans began to blaze. After being tempered by the Heavenly Path, he now had an ethereal temperament.

The next morning, news of Lin Yun being taken in as a core disciple spread. It caused a huge uproar in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, especially when everyone heard that Lin Yun didn’t even make it onto the white ranking. All of the inner disciples were furious and assumed that Lin Yun could only make it as a core disciple because of Feng Jue.

There were over 3,000 inner disciples in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect and 500 core disciples. Lin Yun was in the fifth soul Heavenly Soul Realm, and in the eyes of many inner disciples, he couldn’t even be compared to an outer disciple. There was no way they could accept him becoming a core disciple.

As for the 500 core disciples, they were naturally unhappy as well. After all, not only did Lin Yun become a core disciple, but he also received the opportunity to enter the Sword Saint Mountain. The Sword Saint Mountain had a significant meaning to everyone in the entire Profound Azure Manor.

Normally speaking, if a core disciple wanted to ascend the Sword Saint Mountain, they would need to have enough talent and make enough contributions to receive the qualification. So Lin Yun had practically offended both core and core disciples. Even the outer disciples weren’t very happy. After all, the Heavenly Path might not be famous in Kunlun Realm, but how could someone who hadn’t even made it on the white ranking be accepted as a core disciple?

“Outrageous!” Ye Ziling was furious when she heard about it, which made Wang Yuruo feel uneasy. She wanted to speak up for Lin Yun, but she didn’t dare to utter a word with Ye Ziling next to her.

Ye Ziling had just come back from the Sect Master Mountain to have the sect master take back his order. But the sect master didn’t even come out to look at her. Wang Yuruo knew that Ye Ziling wasn’t furious that the sect master didn’t come out. It was more complicated than that.

The opening of the Sword Saint Mountain was an important event in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. Not only did it require a large amount of Divine Astral Pellets, but the sect master had to host it personally. Otherwise, the one who entered wouldn’t be able to come back out with the terrifying energy contained in the Sword Saint Mountain.

So the quota in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect was extremely precious as it involved the ranking battle in the Profound Azure Sect. Naturally, Wang Yuruo knew how hard Ye Ziling had worked for it.

“Senior Sister, what did the sect master say?” Wang Yuruo asked cautiously.

With a cold expression, Ye Ziling continued, “The sect master told me not to interfere in this matter and just watch.”

Suddenly, Ye Ziling asked, “Who spread out the news that he didn’t even make it on the white ranking?”

Although Lin Yun didn’t catch her attention, she didn’t think that Lin Yun didn’t even make it on the white ranking. She speculated that even if Lin Yun wasn’t talented, it shouldn’t be a problem for him to make it on the white ranking.

In the Heavenly Path, those in the top ten were transcendent geniuses that she couldn’t even compete with. However, those who weren’t in the ranking could only be considered ordinary geniuses in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect.

When Wang Yuruo heard that, she explained what happened the other day. She had a sinking feeling that Feng Zhang spread the news because of his temper. Then again, it was a little petty for an empyrean to act against a fifth soul.

“Looks like he’s the one behind this…” Ye Ziling instantly knew it was true. Although she wasn’t happy with Feng Zhang, she didn’t think that he did anything wrong this time. He naturally did this because he didn’t want Lin Yun to become a core disciple or receive the opportunity to enter the Sword Saint Mountain. Then again, if she had to choose, any core disciple was a lot better than Lin Yun.

Meanwhile, there were many core disciples gathered on a platform closest to the Sword Saint Mountain. This was the Flying Cloud Palace, where the sect master would announce Lin Yun as a core disciple. Feng Zhang was standing in the center of the group with unconcealable fury in his eyes.

“Senior Brother Feng, Lin Yun was ultimately brought here by Senior Feng Jue. Naturally, there’s no way we can compare with him. So there’s no need for you to be angry about it.” Several core disciples were trying to comfort Feng Zhang.

The Sword Saint Mountain was the dream of every single one of them. It would give them a chance to cultivate the strongest sword technique of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. If Lin Yun hadn’t come, there was a high chance that Feng Zhang would ascend the mountain. But a nobody had actually taken that opportunity away from him. How could Feng Zhang not be furious?

Every single opening of the Sword Saint Mountain required the sect master to rest for a long time, and the sect master’s presence was required to host the Sword Saint Mountain.

In an unwilling tone, Feng Zhang replied, “It makes sense for Lin Yun to become a core disciple with Senior Feng Jue’s status. But he’s not qualified to ascend the Sword Saint Mountain!”
