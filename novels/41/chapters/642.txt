Chapter 643 - Final Gate

Left or right? Lin Yun opened his eyes and made a decision. According to his memory, Chief Leng chose the left statue. It didn’t matter if Chief Leng knew about it beforehand, but it was definitely the safest choice.

Taking a step forward, Lin Yun placed his palm on the right statue. When he let go of the statue, there was a dragon spiritual seal on his palm. He looked at it carefully and noticed that it was constructed of numerous complicated spiritual runes, but it didn’t have a powerful fluctuation. Instead, it looked like a key made up of spiritual runes.

The spiritual seal embedded itself on his palm, waiting for the chance to spread across his body. Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts with a peculiar light flashing through his eyes. Recalling back to how the crater appeared, he felt that there was something unusual about it.

How could Lei Yunzi, an infamous demonic cultivator, leave his treasures and inheritance to other experts? Thinking this way, Lin Yun didn’t hesitate to restrict the spiritual seal to his palm.

With light flickering in his pupils, Lin Yun circulated the Iris Sword Sutra and suppressed the spiritual seal on his palm. He only felt relieved after the spiritual seal was completely suppressed. Then, he stopped thinking about it.

The order of the statues so far was tigers, tortoises, and dragons. Suddenly, Lin Yun’s eyes lit up. Were those representing the White Tiger, Black Tortoise, and Azure Dragon?

He had a feeling that he would have to go through four gates to reach the core of the Thundercloud Treasury and that each door had a spiritual seal that acted as a key into the core region. This meant that without the spiritual seal, it would be impossible for anyone to try and enter the core region.

“Since that’s the case, there should be another door with two Vermilion Bird statues.” Lin Yun muttered to himself as he looked at the dragon spiritual mark suppressed on his palm. No matter what, he now had the qualification to enter the core region. Regardless of what tricks Chief Leng was trying to play, he wouldn’t leave here empty-handed.

There was another seal left, so it would be up to Bloodwolf to figure it out.

“Time to get serious.” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly. He had been watching everything by the side. The Bloodwolf Clan and Three-Eagle Stronghold seemed to treat him as some pushover that could be crushed at any time. Since that was the case, he wanted to see who would be the last one standing.

Meanwhile, the Bloodwolf Clan and Three-Eagle Stronghold’s parties continued their journey, pushing their movement techniques to the limit. Both parties had a feeling that the core region was far away. So if they were one step slower, they might lose their initiative on the treasures left behind by Lei Yunzi. They would also lose out on the Blood-Devour Demonic Canon.

However, there were many dangers still along the way. When they arrived at the last gate, the Bloodwolf Clan only had Bloodwolf and Master Fu still alive. As for the Three-Eagle Stronghold, only the three chiefs and Leng Xiangyun were alive.

It seemed like a moment ago when everyone was feeling excitement for the treasures left behind by Lei Yunzi. But in the end, even those in the Yin-Yang stage had suffered a considerable amount of injuries to get this far.

“Another two statues?” Bloodwolf looked at the two statues in the form of birds with doubt in his mind. The statues might look vivid, but he couldn’t find anything unusual about them.

“The last gate!” Chief Leng looked at the stone gate up ahead with excitement. In the next second, he soared into the sky and entered the gate.

Bloodwolf was briefly stunned before he cursed and followed behind. But just when he was about to push the gate open, he paused briefly and turned back to look at Master Fu, giving the letter a signal.

When he entered the gate, the gate behind closed and an isolated palace appeared before him. The palace was massive and without any cracks. Inside, there were nine coffins neatly arranged.

“This…” Master Fu who followed behind was briefly stunned. Are there any more paths? This palace was unlike the core region that everyone had imagined. If this was the final destination, then this place was a little too shabby. How could someone like Lei Yunzi bury himself in such shabby coffins?

Just when they were feeling baffled, the nine coffins exploded and the corpses lying within bounced up on their feet. They all emitted a demonic aura to which Master Fu’s flinched and said, “Human puppets!”

Judging by the clothing of the nine puppets, the puppets looked like the artisans who constructed Lei Yunzi’s abode when he was alive. Unfortunately, they had been refined into puppets. Many spiritualists were proficient in refining puppets, but making puppets out of human beings was taboo since ancient times.

Lei Yunzi was truly brutal and there was a reason why he was called a demon. But before Bloodwolf and Master Fu could think about it, the nine puppets sensed a living being and pounced over.

“Courting death!” Bloodwolf snorted as flames ignited on his armor, forming a ferocious fire dragon that coiled around him. With the dragon coiled around him, he emitted an even more violent energy, climbing closer to the greater Yin-Yang stage.

The dragon would coil around his arm and overlap with his fist whenever he threw a punch. With each punch, the sound of a dragon roar and whistling wind could be heard.

The attacks were ferocious and the defensive abilities of the Flamedragon Armor was unbelievably strong. With the armor, Bloodwolf wasn’t even afraid of the puppet’s corrosive and poisonous attacks. By himself, he faced four puppets at the same time and was even able to suppress them.

On the other hand, the three chiefs were barely able to block four puppets. Aside from Chief Leng, the other two chiefs were having difficulty facing the puppets as the corrosive demonic aura from the puppets was too terrifying.

As for the remaining puppet, it was being stalled by Master Fu and Leng Xiangyun. The tedious battle lasted for an hour before the nine puppets were dealt with. All four of the Yin-Yang stage experts had suffered injuries from the fight. Even Bloodwolf, who didn’t seem injured, had a pale expression as he had exhausted a great deal of his origin energy.

“Hehe, Bloodwolf, you’re going to be shocked that you made it so far with such great difficulty only to die,” sneered Chief Leng and the two chiefs as they stood before Leng Xiangyun and looked at Bloodwolf.

Just when Bloodwolf was bewildered, Chief Leng chuckled and started pouring origin energy into his open palm. The tiger spiritual seal began to emit a bright light that caused the entire palace to tremble violently with large rocks constantly falling down from the ceiling.

At the same time, a painting appeared on the wall up ahead. The painting was two meters in length and looked like a bronze gate with a white tiger painting engraved on it.

Chief Leng looked at Bloodwolf with mockery on his face, “You should be able to figure it out by now. What a pity. You can enter this place, but you can’t leave.”

Bloodwolf looked at the painting on the wall before he looked down at the spiritual seal in his palm. He smiled, “I see. Looks like I have to thank you for resolving my doubts.”

When Chief Leng saw the smile on Bloodwolf’s face, he instantly felt that there was something unusual about this situation. Standing beside Bloodwolf, Master Fu snickered as he opened his palm. Beside the white tiger painting, a vermillion bird painting slowly appeared.

“You were acting well this whole time. I was nearly fooled by you and allowed you to take the entire Thundercloud Treasury!” Bloodwolf looked at Chief Leng coldly.

Chief Leng’s acting was pretty believable as he pretended to accidentally place his hand on the statue when they jumped into the crater. He also went out of his way by pretending to be anxious and trying to divert Bloodwolf’s attention away from the statues. Bloodwolf was just one step away from being fooled.

The tense atmosphere was suddenly interrupted when the stone gate opened up and an azure figure walked in. When everyone saw the appearance of the newcomer, both Bloodwolf and Chief Leng were shocked, “Lin Yun!”

“Lin Yun is actually still alive!” Many people had died along the way, including pinnacle Yang stage experts. Lin Yun was only in the greater Yang stage, but he was actually one of the last ones standing. This alone left them shocked.

Lin Yun raised his head to look at the paintings on the wall and instantly knew what was going on. The paintings were the gates that could only be resolved by those with the spiritual seals. When Lin Yun poured his origin energy into his palm, an azure dragon painting appeared beside the two other paintings.

“The two of you don't seem to welcome me,” said Lin Yun when he noticed the changes on Bloodwolf and Chief Leng’s faces.

“Kill him!” Bloodwolf and Chief Leng both came to an agreement. It was tough for them to accept that they had to divide the treasury into two shares, not to mention three. So Lin Yun had to die no matter what.

Looking at Chief Leng and Bloodwolf coming to him, Lin Yun maintained his composure with a faint smile rising on his lips.
