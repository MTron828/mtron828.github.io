Chapter 2023 - Black Lotus Sacred Flame

Over the past month, a heated discussion revolving around the Divine Blood Flower existed. Due to an ancient seal around the God Burial Mountain Range, no one above the Quasi-Saint Realm could enter.

Everyone felt that the Divine Blood Flower would go to the six holy lands no matter how they competed, and that was initially the case. The Heavenly Dao Sect’s Nangong Fuye managed to seize the Divine Blood Flower, and the other holy lands could only wait for Saint Realm experts to arrive to compete with the Heavenly Dao Sect again.

But Jin Xuanyi’s arrival surprised everyone, and he seized the Divine Blood Flower from Nangong Fuye. Ultimately, he welcomed everyone to challenge him for the Divine Blood Flower. When the news got out, everyone was curious as to why Jin Xuanyi wanted to do this. After all, he was ranked first on the King Ranking for two years and purposely didn’t enter the Quasi-Saint Realm.

This made everyone speculate that Jin Xuanyi was waiting for the Blue Dragon Record to appear. Jin Xuanyi wanted to use this opportunity to defeat the six holy lands’ experts and step into the Quasi-Saint Realm with an invincible demeanor. This was what Jin Xuanyi was planning, but many people wanted to use this opportunity to defeat him.

If they could defeat Jin Xuanyi, they could obtain the Divine Blood Flower and even obtain the glory Jin Xuanyi had accumulated from being on the King Ranking for the past two years. Glory might be invisible, but it truly existed.

Six Holy City was a majestic city that existed since ancient times. It was a Dragon City forged by the Dragon Gate but later became desolate during the Golden Era. The six holy lands now took over to manage the city, and it was the safest place within the God Burial Mountain Range. The city had multiple arenas where many cultivators often fought, with at least ten thousand people watching their battles.

The biggest arena was the Stormwind Arena, also known as the Six Holy Stormwind Arena. Half a month ago, the tickets in the arena were all gone, and the price of one ticket went as high as a hundred thousand Nirvana Pellets.

Today was the day Jin Xuanyi would accept the challengers, and the arena was filled with people. The six holy lands occupied the spots closest to the arena.

“I remember that Jin Xuanyi wasn’t that high-profiled in the past. So why is he suddenly standing out?” A purple-clothed man said. His name was Qu Duan, ranked sixth on the King Ranking. He was a genius demonic cultivator from the Black Mountain with deep and unfathomable strength.

A grey-clothed youth beside him named Li Yanxian smiled, “Brother Qu, you’ve been in seclusion for too long. There are rumors that the Blue Dragon Record will appear, and all the geniuses wtihin the Kunlun Realm will gather at that time. No one can leave their name on it if they aren’t Quasi-Saints, and Jin Xuanyi is ambitious. He wants to use the six holy lands’ geniuses as a stepping stone, wanting to seize all of their glory!”

“The Blue Dragon Record is going to appear?” Qu Duan was shocked. He said, “I’ve heard rumors about it in the past, but I’ve been in seclusion to refine the Black Lotus Sacred Flame. It looks like I’ve ended my seclusion at the right time.”

Qu Duan was excited, with flames blazing within his pupils. After all, the Blue Dragon Record was a divine artifact that represented the re-emergence of the Golden Era. There were legends that it had countless geniuses recorded on it, and geniuses would compete amongst themselves whenever it appeared.

“The Black Lotus Sacred Flame? You really obtained the Black Lotus Sacred Flame?!” Li Yanxian exclaimed.

“I obtained it long ago and have spent two years refining it. I have achieved the Black Lotus Saint Physique now with ten dragon pulses. The sacred flame has tempered my entire body!” Qu Duan smiled. There were legends that the Black Mountain had an emperor flame passed down from ancient times and had been burning on the Black Lotus.

One could only obtain a sacred flame seed from the emperor flame after going through several tests and putting their lives on the line.

Not only did Qu Duan make it through the tests, but he even survived. Thus, he had spent the last two years obtaining the Black Lotus Saint Physique.

“You’re here for Jin Xuanyi!” Li Yanxian exclaimed.

Qu Duan was conceited and asked with a smile, “I can’t? Only he’s allowed to use the six holy lands’ geniuses as stepping stones, and I can’t? I’m not the only one with this intention. I might have feared Jin Xuanyi in the past, but not anymore.”

Li Yanxian smiled and said, “The six holy lands must have their confidence to agree with Jin Xuanyi. They’re probably not afraid of him.”

Qu Duan threw a glance at the six holy lands. He had a rough impression of the one leading the party for the six holy lands.

“It looks like those who came aren’t weak. Wu Jun of the Divine Phoenix Sect, Zhang Ziling of the Ming Cult, Chen Daoyuan of the Heavenly Flame Sect, Zhang Qiu of the Myriad Lightning Sect, and Gu Yunfei of the Divine Dao Pavilion. All of them can make it into the top ten on the King Ranking.” Qu Duan didn’t look down on those from the six holy lands, especially the Divine Phoenix Sect and Divine Dao Pavilion.

“Who’s that woman from the Heavenly Dao Sect? She wants to replace Nangong Fuye?” Qu Duan curiously asked.

“That’s the Serene Dust Great Saint’s disciple, and she had reached the ninth transformation of the Nirvana Stage not long ago. But she’s lacking, and her life will probably be in danger if she fights Jin Xuanyi,” Li Yanxian said.

“There is a huge gap between the Heavenly Dao Sect’s generation. Aside from the Dao Yang Holy Son, don’t they have any other geniuses?” Qu Duan smiled.

“They do. I heard that they recently acquired a genius swordsman named Ye Qingtian. His sword technique is formidable, and he’s also a genius in Music Dao. Even Young Master Wushuang was defeated by him,” Li Yanxian replied.

“Never heard of him before.” Qu Duan shook his head and said, “His reputation is probably fake. Who dares claim to be a genius swordsman before Brother Li? I remember you’ve long grasped the Firmament Sword Intent, right?”

Li Yanxian had pride reflected in his pupils when he heard that, and he smiled, “That was a long time ago. I have reached the Quasi-Astral Sword Intent now.”

Qu Duan dropped his smile and replied, “As expected of Li Yanxian, ranked seventh on the King Ranking. It looks like you’ve made huge progress like me.”

“Who doesn’t want to be on the Blue Dragon Ranking? If we can step on Jin Xuanyi, we’ll be able to seize all the glory he has accumulated on the King Ranking,” Li Yanxian smiled.

“You can have fun thinking about it, hahaha!” Qu Duan laughed, and he flew to the arena.

At the Stormwind Arena, Jin Xuanyi was resting with his eyes closed. He opened his eyes and looked ahead when he sensed a baleful aura.

“Jin Xuanyi, you said anyone from the six holy lands can challenge you. I wonder if someone from the Black Mountain can also challenge you?” Qu Duan smiled.

“Qu Duan?” Jin Xuanyi called out after pondering for a moment.

“It has been two years since we last met, and I’m glad you didn’t forget me.” Qu Duan smiled with a hint of pride in him.

A commotion rose from the surroundings because no one expected someone to step forth to challenge Jin Xuanyi before the six holy lands.

“I heard he obtained the Black Lotus Sacred Flame two years ago. But everyone thought he was incinerated to death by the sacred flame because he hadn’t shown himself for the past two years.”

“How is it possible for him to be dead? He’s probably trying to obtain the Black Lotus Saint Physique so that his journey in the Quasi-Saint Realm can be smoother.”

“He has probably achieved it, and I bet there’s a great show to watch now.” The Black Mountain was influential within the Eastern Desolation. Seven Great Saints established the Black Mountain on the demonic path. Their foundation might be inferior to the six holy lands, but their reputation wasn’t any weaker, especially in the past millennium.

The surrounding atmosphere became high, and it was pretty exciting to see Qu Duan fighting Jin Xuanyi.

“That works as well.” Jin Xuanyi casually said as he stood up. “It won’t waste much time anyways. Anyone can challenge me since I dare to set up an arena.”

The two began to fight in the Stormwind Arena. They didn’t take long to exchange over a few hundred moves. They were evenly matched in this battle and it was exciting. Even with a barrier enveloping the arena, everyone could feel the horrifying aura when they fought.

“Black Lotus Sacred Flame!” Qu Duan didn’t want to drag the battle any longer. As a Black Lotus appeared within his pupils, black lotuses ignited around him.
