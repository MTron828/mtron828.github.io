Chapter 209 - Perfect One Star Spiritual Rune

The sight of Ku Yun kneeling had shocked everyone. Not just Liu Yue and Hu Xingyang, but even Lin Yun himself was taken aback. But he soon recovered from his shock. Ku Yun must’ve seen the Firecloud Pellets on the table. Ku Yun might be grumpy, but he was also a straightforward person.

He was merciless when scolding others, but he would also apologize straightforwardly when he knew that he was in the wrong. But even so, there was no way Lin Yun could accept Ku Yun kneeling to him.

He had no idea what the Firecloud Spiritual Runes meant to Ku Yun. It was the last wish of Ku Yun’s father, the goal that he had worked tirelessly for his entire life. Yet, this was accomplished by Lin Yun. In the end, he had mistakenly blamed Lin Yun when in reality, it was Lin Yun who helped him fulfill his father’s last wish.

He had even badly scolded Lin Yun… So although getting down on his knees might seem a little dramatic, it was an act that contained fifty years of emotions that Ku Yun had been suppressing in his chest. It was the embodiment of all his bitterness and pain. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Master, please get up. I can’t possibly accept you kneeling to me.” Lin Yun quickly stepped forward and helped Ku Yun up.

After Ku Yun got up, he looked at Liu Yue and Hu Xingyang with a frown. He turned to Lin Yun and explained, “Lin Yun, I swear that I’ve said nothing about you destroying my Spiritual Rune Brush. I was the cause for the brush’s destruction, so there was no way I could blame you for it.”

His words instantly caused a commotion in the surrounding. Liu Yue and Hu Xingyang said they were under orders from Master Ku Yun to arrest Lin Yun, but Ku Yun was saying something different. His words were equivalent to a slap on Liu Yue and Hu Xingyang’s faces.

Huangfu Jingxuan wore an odd smile when he watched this scene unfolding. Looking at the awkward expression on Liu Yue and Hu Xingyang’s face, he instantly understood something.

“Hahaha, so it turns out this was a misunderstanding. Then we’ll be taking our leave,” Hu Xingyang laughed. He knew that things were going in the wrong direction and wanted to take his leave immediately. But how would he get his wish so easily?

“Stop right there!” Lin Yun barked. “We’re not done yet, so why are you leaving?”

“What’s going on?” Ku Yun asked with doubt on his face.

Looking at Liu Yue, Lin Yun explained, “I have some bad blood with this woman, so Deacon Hu is trying to degrade me to a herb slave under your ‘orders.’”

At this moment, Huangfu Jingxuan immediately stepped forth and explained, “I can be a witness to that. Everyone here can. Earlier on, Deacon Hu said that it was under your orders to arrest Lin Yun.”

Ku Yun’s face instantly turned black when he heard that. He roared, “Hu Xingyang, do you not want your position as a deacon anymore? Who gave you the authority to slander me? I will be talking about this to the Hall Masters!”

Hu Xingyang was frightened. As a deacon, his position was naturally inferior to an alchemist. He had done something so outrageous, so he knew that he wouldn’t be able to escape punishment if this matter reached the upper hierarchy. He was acting rampantly under the name of an alchemist and this was something that no alchemist could accept.

“Master, please let me go!” Hu Xingyang collapsed onto the ground and started begging, “I didn’t have a choice!”

He was now filled with regrets. He never expected Lin Yun to have such an ironclad relationship with Ku Yun. Nor did he expect that Lin Yun wasn’t chased away in the manner that he thought.

“Tell that to Lin Yun,” Ku Yun replied. His face was cold and he didn’t want to be bothered with Hu Xingyang.

“Lin Yun, this really is a misunderstanding. I-I-I won’t make things difficult for you anymore in the future.” Hu Xingyang immediately turned to Lin Yun with his tears on the verge of falling.

However, Lin Yun was sneering inwardly. He still remembered how Hu Xingyang made things difficult for him three days ago. It was just that revenge came so quickly and sweetly. It was already too late for Hu Xingyang to apologize even if he begged on his knees.

“Deacon Liu… why don’t you say something?” Hu Xingyang immediately turned to Liu Yue for help.

Ku Yun raged the moment he heard that. “You’re a deacon from the Herbal Hall. Who gave you the balls to interfere in the matters of the Pellet Hall?!”

Liu Yue’s face instantly turned ugly. Other deacons from the Herbal Hall wouldn’t have the right to speak in the Pellet Hall and they could only bow when facing a one star alchemist. After all, the Herbal Hall was under the Pellet Hall’s jurisdiction. But Liu Yue was different. Her father was the commander of the Divine Guards, the Soaring Dragon General.

With a cold face, she replied coldly, “Master Ku Yun, this matter is none of your business, so I’m giving you a warning. You’d better not interfere in my matters with Lin Yun. Deacon Hu, get up on your feet. I’ll personally explain it to the Third Hall Master.”

Everyone’s faces suddenly changed when they saw how Liu Yue dared to threaten an alchemist. She had flipped the tables completely. But then again, she did have some authority to speak in the Pellet Hall. Otherwise, Hu Xingyang wouldn’t have listened to her.

Hu Xingyang felt relieved and cupped his hands together, “Master, I will definitely give you an explanation after this matter.”

Liu Yue dared to offend Ku Yun. However, Hu Xingyang didn’t dare to do this, else he couldn’t stay in the Pellet Hall anymore.

Ku Yun’s face became unsightly at Liu Yue daring to threaten a one star alchemist. Damn it, if only I were a two star alchemist, there’s no way this brat would dare to act so arrogantly.

“Who’s causing the racket here?!” A group of people walked over. The one leading the group was an old man who had a serious look. There were three stars embroidered on his chest, which proved his status as a three star alchemist.

“Greetings, Second Hall Master!” Everyone immediately bowed upon seeing the old man. When Liu Yue and Hu Xingyang saw the Second Hall Master, Leng Ya, their faces changed drastically.

Leng Ya swept a glance out and frowned, “Ku Yun, aren’t you busy making a breakthrough to the two star alchemist? What are you doing here arguing with a few juniors instead of refining?”

Ku Yun smiled bitterly upon hearing that and did not know what to say.

At this moment, Lin Yun’s eyes flickered. He cupped his hands together and said, “Reporting to the Second Hall Master, Master Ku Yun has mastered the Firecloud Spiritual Rune and successfully refined the Firecloud Pellet. But there were some twists and turns on the way. I accidentally destroyed his brush and as a result, someone tried to make a fuss over it and degrade me to a herb slave. This is the reason why Master Ku Yun stood up for me.”

“Oh? Something like that took place in the Pellet Hall? One of my alchemists was placed in a difficult position? Wait a minute… What did you just say? Ku Yun grasped the Firecloud Spiritual Rune?!” Leng Ya’s face changed drastically.

Even Ku Yun panicked a little. But when he saw the eye signal Lin Yun gave him, he bit the bullet and went with it, “It’s all thanks to the Pellet Hall that I managed to grasp the Firecloud Spiritual Rune.”

Leng Ya suddenly smiled, “The Firecloud Spiritual Rune is difficult. Do you have a Firecloud Pellet with you that I can take a look at?”

Unfortunately, Ku Yun didn’t carry it with him since he came in a hurry. He immediately replied, “They’re in my Alchemy Chamber and there are three in total.”

“Men, bring it to me immediately!” Leng Ya seemed excited. If Ku Yun grasped the Firecloud Spiritual Rune, then he would become a two star alchemist. One and two stars might seem to have a small difference when you look at the grades, but the gap was truly enormous.

It was a piece of good news to the Pellet Hall if Ku Yun could be promoted to a two star alchemist, so how could Leng Ya not get excited?

It didn’t take long for someone to fetch the three Firecloud Pellets. Leng Ya took them and looked at the spiritual rune at the bottom before his eyes suddenly lit up. Throughout this entire process, Ku Yun was feeling nervous.

On the other hand, Lin Yun had a smile on his face. He was confident in his attainments.

Leng Ya examined the three Firecloud Pellets briefly before he nodded with a smile, “Interesting… The Firecloud Pellets are so perfectly inscribed, elegant and powerful. Take a look at it yourselves. And here you guys were still mocking Ku Yun over the fact that he blew four cauldrons. Now, take a look at the pellets yourselves and learn from him!

“So what if you guys blew your cauldrons? If you guys can inscribe such a perfect Firecloud Spiritual Rune, blowing four cauldrons isn’t even worth mentioning. You can blow up hundreds of them if you want!”

The alchemists behind him looked at the pellet and all of them were surprised.

“Congratulations, Brother Ku Yun. This Firecloud Spiritual Rune is really amazing!”

“Even I’m feeling ashamed looking at it.”

“It’s truly worth celebrating that you can refine Firecloud Pellets of such quality at the cost of four cauldrons.” The alchemists began giving their congratulations to Ku Yun.

“Ku Yun, you’re now a two star alchemist starting today. You are now allowed to look up and learn two star spiritual runes,” Leng Ya announced with a smile, promoting Ku Yun to a two star alchemist.

Everyone was shocked when they heard this. Many of them looked at Ku Yun with their eyes glowing. In the Pellet Hall, there were only ten core alchemists that were two stars, aside from the three Hall Masters, who were three star alchemists.

At the same time, Liu Yue and Hu Xingyang’s faces became quite interesting. Hu Xingyang even wanted to slap himself on the spot. He couldn’t afford to offend a one star alchemist, not to mention a two star alchemist.

He understood that alchemists were the Pellet Hall’s pillars and the dozen two star alchemists were its cores, aside from the three Hall Masters.

“Hall Master, I’m still not confident about that. Can we do that on another date?” Ku Yun had no confidence about that. After all, the Firecloud Spiritual Runes were done by Lin Yun and they had nothing to do with him.

“Why are you so humble? The Firecloud Spiritual Rune is the hardest among one star spiritual runes and you’re fully qualified to become a two star alchemist since you can inscribe such a perfect spiritual rune. Or are you doubting my eyes?” The Second Hall Master teased, not giving Ku Yun any opportunity to decline.

Suddenly, Leng Ya thought of another matter and looked at Lin Yun, “What’s your name again?”

“My name is Lin Yun.”

“Lin Yun, what did you say earlier? I forgot it.” Leng Ya looked at Lin Yun. He was too excited earlier on and finally remembered Lin Yun’s existence.

“These two deacons tried to make me into a herb slave by waving Master Ku Yun’s banner. Especially the Herbal Hall’s Deacon Liu. She even arrogantly threatened Master Ku Yun not to be too close to me,” Lin Yun said without showing any mercy. Didn’t Liu Yue want to play with him? Then he’ll play with her!
