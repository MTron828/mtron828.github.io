Chapter 791 - Ferocious Competition

Lin Yun, who was seated at the center of the stage, exploded with a terrifying aura. As a dazzling light shined from his eyes, his aura surged until it reached the pinnacle Yin-Yang stage. Not only did he make a breakthrough in three days, but he had also reached the pinnacle Yin-Yang stage.

A while later, the light in Lin Yun’s eyes dissipated and his terrifying aura calmed down. However, it almost seemed like Lin Yun was a flame that was accumulating and waiting to ignite once more. Lin Yun gave a sigh of relief and grey smoke exited his body.

He only needed three days to refine all 7,000 fourth grade spiritual jades. It was unbelievable that Lin Yun was able to refine all of them. He was only able to succeed because the Iris Sword Sutra refined the spiritual jades while the Azure Dragon Enneaform contained the tyrannical power. It was risky, but the results were worth it.

In his violet palace, the origin energy millstone had solidified and now flickered with purple luster. After reaching the pinnacle Yin-Yang stage, the yin and yang energy constantly merged within Lin Yun’s body. Geniuses with deep foundation and powerful cultivation techniques would even possess dense origin energy.

As for Lin Yun’s origin energy, it was as massive as a mountain and swayed with the enormous millstone. The Iris Sword Sutra successfully solidified his dense origin energy that came from the spiritual energy that he absorbed.

Even heaven-defying geniuses wouldn’t be able to subdue such a powerful millstone because that amount of origin energy would’ve ripped their body apart. But Lin Yun was different. His Iris Sword Sutra reached the eleventh stage, which meant that the Iris Flower had ninety-nine petals with each petal containing an immense sword aura.

The Iris Flower was planted at the center of the millstone like an array that suppressed the violent aura of the millstone. So, Lin Yun’s body wouldn’t be harmed by the millstone even if he used his full strength, not to mention that he also had the Azure Dragon Enneaform for emergencies.

Tapping his foot on the stage, Lin Yun flashed and appeared among the puppets. There were many puppets gathered on one side of the courtyard as a training area. They were fifth grade puppets created by powerful spiritualists from the Sacred Alliance, so they were stronger than ordinary puppets.

Lin Yun looked at a pinnacle Yin-Yang stage puppet. The puppet was six meters in height. It was made of black material, it’s eyes constantly flickered , and it was filled with a dense aura.

“Let me give it a whirl.” Lin Yun muttered to himself before he flicked several fourth grade spiritual jades towards the puppet. When the spiritual jades entered the puppet, the aura of the puppet suddenly exploded with terrifying power.

Iris Sword Sutra! Lin Yun circulated his cultivation technique and the millstone in his violet palace started to spin. The millstone spun slowly and it trembled violently every half inch while roaring like a ferocious beast. In a split second, violent silver origin energy filled Lin Yun’s profound veins.

An explosive power leaked out of Lin Yun’s body as his pores opened and radiated a faint silver color. His power wasn’t flashy, but it sent sparks towards the puppet once it activated. With just this, the surface of the puppet was filled with dents as if it had been corroded by rain.

But Lin Yun knew that this wasn’t enough. If his power was only this strong, then the resources he spent over the past three days would have been a waste. With a single thought, Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with silver brilliance as the millstone spun even faster. Soon, Lin Yun exploded with silver brilliance that cut through the darkness like a sharp sword.

Almost immediately, the dents on the puppet turned into holes. When the puppet got close to Lin Yun, he clenched his fist and threw a punch. Just like that, the puppet was smashed into countless pieces.

Lin Yun gasped for air as beads of sweat dripped from his forehead and unprecedented joy filled his eyes. Through relying on just his cultivation, he could easily destroy a pinnacle Yin-Yang stage puppet. His origin energy was so high that pinnacle Yin-Yang stage experts at the level of the seven elites weren't even comparable.

“This is enough to deal with the seven elites. But what do I do about the three kings?” Lin Yun’s face became grave as the three kings were equivalent to towering mountains. His spiritual sword intent was his greatest trump card and he had yet to reveal the Dustlight Sword Art, Azure Dragon Enneaform, and the Overlord Sword’s fifth and sixth forms.

He also had his two strongest sword techniques, Supreme Dominance and Terranean Destruction. If they weren’t enough, his last resort was the Iris Sword Sutra.

“I might have a chance to get first place.” Lin Yun analyzed his chances in his heart. However, the three kings were still the three kings. Even if they didn’t fight for real, there wasn’t a guarantee that Lin Yun could win. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Fifteen minutes later, Lin Yun walked out of the cultivating chamber and started practicing the Dustlight Sword Art in the courtyard. He had completed the mysterious sword technique from the painting and brought it to the manifestation stage. Every single time he practiced it, he would gain a new comprehension and would be submerged in his thoughts.

When Lin Yun sheathed his sword, his heart had calmed down. Looking at the stars in the sky, Lin Yun smiled because the great boost in his cultivation had actually affected his mentality. He naturally had to fight to become the number one ranker, but there was no need for him to get obsessed with first place.

With the Flower Burial Sword in his hand, he would try to shine as much as he could. As long as he tried his best, he wouldn’t be disappointed in himself. Suddenly, Lin Yun got goosebumps from a terrifying aura that came out of nowhere. Without any warning, a sword ray was headed straight for him. So, Lin Yun turned around and sliced it in half..

“Hehe, that’s a great sword technique.” Out of nowhere, a voice chuckled from the shadows. When Lin Yun raised his head, he saw Yue Weiwei sitting on the branch of a tall tree. She was smiling at him like a little girl who had just pranked someone.

Sheathing his sword, Lin Yun sat beside the stone table and smiled, “Come and sit.”

“Okay, I’m coming down,” said Yue Weiwei as she nodded her head. When she landed next to Lin Yun, she pulled a fruit from her back and tried to shove it into Lin Yun’s mouth, “Come, open your mouth. This is for you.”

“No need.” When she got close, Lin Yun caught a whiff of her fragrance. Not understanding what game she was playing at, Lin Yun quickly tried to avoid her. But the moment he moved, Yue Weiwei predicted his movement and got in his way. Her hand reached for his chest, which caused his face to change and he nearly drew his sword by instinct. However, he immediately hesitated when he remembered Yue Weiwei’s antics.

The brief hesitation allowed Yue Weiwei’s hand to reach his chest and she gave Lin Yun a solid thump. The pain forced Lin Yun’s mouth wide open and Yue Weiwei quickly shoved a piece of the fruit into his mouth.

“Your body is pretty honest, unlike your words.” Yue Weiwei smiled at Lin Yun.

Lin Yun smiled bitterly, but he could sense that his body temperature was lowered by quite a bit. He instantly knew that the fruit wasn’t simple since the cold aura coursed through his body, alleviating the deep injuries that he had received over the last few days.

“What was that?” Lin Yun asked curiously.

“It’s the Cold Cloud Fruit from the Heavenly Demon Pavilion. It’s something the demon clan likes to eat to temper their physique. The pavilion master gave me a few when he saw how pretty I am. Hehe, not even Yan Long’zi has one of these.” Yue Weiwei smiled. While she talked, she ignored Lin Yun’s gaze and shoved the remaining fruit into her mouth.

It didn’t take long for her to eat the entire fruit and Lin Yun knew that she purposely gave him something precious.

“Why did you join the banquet?” Lin Yun finally asked her the question that had been bothering him for a while. Yue Weiwei must be from the bigger world like Drifting Goblet and Su Ziyao, so it made no sense for her to join this banquet. After all, if she was able to come, she was able to return.

“Me?” Yue Weiwei retracted her smile and put on a resentful expression. “Because I’m too pretty. Actually, everyone from the Heavenly Fox Clan is a beauty. At the age of six, many people visited my father to ask for my hand in marriage. When I was fifteen, we had a visitor that my father couldn't deny and they started to plan my wedding. That’s when I chose to run away from home.”

“But how is that related to you joining the banquet?” Lin Yun asked. Yue Weiwei was beating around the bush and hadn’t given him the answer yet.

“Why don’t you guess?” Yue Weiwei smiled before she left like a wisp of smoke.

Perhaps it had something to do with Heavenly Gate. Lin Yun pondered this matter, but he couldn’t guess the actual reason no matter how hard he speculated. In the end, Yue Weiwei’s appearance was just a small event.

Another day passed and the entire city boiled once more because the ranking battle was going to start soon.
