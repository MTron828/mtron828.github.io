Chapter 2112 - Huge Opportunity

“You’re saying this is a Buddhist Emperor Relic?” Lin Yun captured the key point in Lil’ Purple’s words, and the two words ‘Buddhist Emperor’ were enough to make him excited. After all, the holy sons and holy maidens from around the world have gathered at the God Burial Mountain Range, risking their lives for the inheritance of an ancient Emperor.

That was when martial cultivation was the most splendid era, and Emperors in ancient times could even compete with deities. If the heart of the Sacred Fire Golden Lotus had a Buddhist Emperor Relic, it would be a huge opportunity for him. This meant he obtained an opportunity comparable to those holy sons and holy maidens without going to those forbidden grounds.

“Wait, that’s not right.” Before Lil’ Purple could reply, Lin Yun suddenly thought of something and said, “Isn’t a Buddhist Relic something produced after a monk's death? Why did it appear within the golden lotus? Lil’ Purple, you’re not bluffing me, right?”

“Let me explain it to you. Many people only know that the Golden Lotus Flametree is a sacred tree of the Buddhist Sect, but they didn’t know that there is a unique type Golden Lotus Flametree, which could be called a divine tree. Ordinary Golden Lotus Flametrees naturally couldn’t produce Buddhist Relics, but if it was fused with the golden body of a Buddhist Emperor and nourished with the Buddhist Emperor’s soul, do you still think it’s impossible to produce a Buddhist Emperor Relic?” Lil’ Purple explained.

“So you’re saying this tree is something like that?” Lin Yun looked at the Golden Lotus Flametree, but he couldn’t find anything special about it.

The cultivators from the other domains came in at this time, and their faces were ugly. This was because the six holy lands divided all of the matured Sacred Fire Golden Lotuses amongst themselves, so no mature golden lotus was left. The golden lotuses left to them were immature, giving off a dim radiance with many impurities. But there was nothing they could do about it, so they retrieved those golden lotuses.

To vent their unhappiness, several people snapped the tree branches and punched the tree trunk before leaving. When all the Sacred Fire Golden Lotuses were divided, the tree branches and leaves became dim, losing their radiance. They also began to rapidly wither away, looking like they would die soon.

Lin Yun naturally wasn’t convinced that this tree had fused with the golden body of a Buddhist Emperor and nourished with a Buddhist Emperor’s soul.

“You’ll know at that time. Peel off the tree bark after everyone leaves, and you’ll know.” Lil’ Purple shook her head with her cheeks puffed up.

Lin Yun could only stow the Sacred Fire Golden Lotus and didn’t talk much about it with her. Disciples of the Heavenly Dao Sect still surrounded him, and they all looked at him with reverence, congratulating him.

Bai Qingyu’s smile bloomed on her face, and anyone could tell she was proud. When she looked at Lin Yun, her eyes were shining brightly. “See what I said before? It’s the right decision to bring Big Brother Ye over!”

In her heart, Ye Qingtian was invincible.

“Congratulations. It looks like I was blind before.” Bai Yunfeng stepped forth to apologize to Lin Yun.

“It’s fine,” Lin Yun smiled. Bai Yunfeng wasn’t hateful. Although Bai Yunfeng didn’t like him, he still considered him a fellow disciple. Not to mention that it was thanks to Bai Yunfeng that he could obtain the Sacred Fire Golden Lotus containing a Buddhist Emperor Relic.

“But that doesn’t mean I’ll let you go for ruining the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden’s reputation,” Bai Yunfeng seriously said after congratulating Lin Yun.

When Lin Yun wanted to reply, Bai Qingyu stood out. She unhappily said, “What are you talking about? Even if someone does go after him, it will be my brother-in-law, not you. So don’t poke your nose too deep into this business. Besides, I don’t mind it!”

Bai Yunfeng was furious upon hearing that because Bai Qingyu was helping an outsider. He didn’t want to stay there for much longer and left with the other saint disciples for the Heavenly Dao Sect after giving a few instructions.

Lin Yun called out to Wang Yue, and asked, “Wang Yue, why is the Blood Moon Sect so bold now?”

The Blood Moon Sect had a terrifying foundation; not even the Nine Emperors joining hands could wipe them out. After developing for many years, their forces have spread throughout the Kunlun Realm. But they have been lying low in recent years and rarely acted with such a high profile like Zhao Tianyu.

“The Eastern Desolation has become chaotic, with various forces gathering together. But the holy lands’ attention is on the God Burial Mountain Range, and they couldn’t care about anything else for now. Most importantly, the Demonspirits have begun to appear in great numbers, so the various holy lands are cautious,” Wang Yue sighed.

Lin Yun didn’t expect the Eastern Desolation to become so chaotic for the past two months he was in seclusion.

“Big Brother Ye, are you coming with us? With the Sacred Fire Golden Lotus, you can attempt to reach the Quasi-Saint Realm before the Blue Dragon Record appears!” Bai Qingyu’s eyes shone brightly. It’s as though she could already see Ye Qingtian shining brightly after recovering from his injuries.

But Lin Yun merely smiled and found an excuse to reject her offer. He wanted to see if Lil' Purple’s statement was true, so he had to wait till night.

He left with the group but didn’t leave for long and found a secluded location near the magma river. When he took out the Sacred Fire Golden Lotus, he calmly looked at it, knowing that it was a great treasure. Each petal was transparent, like a flawless jade covered with ancient runes. As the sacred fire blazed, saint radiance shone brightly, and Lin Yun could hear someone chanting a scripture into his ears. He exclaimed, “This is really magical.”

He had yet to start refining it, and yet he could sense his comprehension increasing after basking in the radiance, entering an empty state of mind. If he practiced his sword technique in this state, it would have an unbelievable effect. This was much stronger than the previous Bodhi Seed that he refined. Furthermore, the Sacred Fire Golden Lotus looked alive, and the flames gave him a feeling that it would never be extinguished.

“You’re really lucky to have obtained a treasure like this so easily. It’s much easier than the other holy sons and maidens who fought amongst themselves.” Lil’ Purple came out of the Iris Secret Realm and exclaimed.

But Lin Yun didn’t like what she said. He replied, “I didn’t obtain it for nothing. I injured three Venerables, not to mention there’s one at the Indigo Origin Phase who has grasped a greater dao amongst them.”

Lil’ Purple looked at the Sacred Fire Golden Lotus and said with disdain, “They’re nothing. That Blood Moon Divine Son is the trouble. That Whiteclothed Venerable might not even be able to defeat Bai Yunfeng.”

Lin Yun didn’t refute those words because the Blood Moon Divine Son was truly unfathomable. But Lin Yun was surprised that Zhao Tianyu would leave so easily after retrieving a few ordinary golden lotuses.

“The Blood Moon Divine Son is strong. If he didn’t care about the three Venerables, the outcome might have been uncertain.” Lin Yun didn’t dwell on it, and changed the topic. He asked, “How do I use this? Can it reforge the physique like what Bai Qingyu said?”

Lil’ Purple nodded, “What she said is right. Remember that your dragon pulses were heavily damaged in the past? The Sacred Fire Golden Lotus can repair your dragon pulses, and the effects are much better.”

“How do I refine it, then?” Lin Yun asked with his eyes shining brightly.

“Refine it? Why refine it now? Leave it for now,” Lil’ Purple said. “You’re not injured. Others think you’ve failed in your breakthrough and suffered injuries because of it, but you’re not injured. Have you even lost your memory? If you use it now, it won’t have much effect, so you might as well keep it with you as an extra life. You have a ferocious fighting style, and I’m more relieved now that you have it.”

Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts. What Lil’ Purple said wasn’t wrong.

“Not to mention the greatest effect isn’t to reforge your body. You can use the leaves to cultivate the Buddhist Cult’s Golden Body. As for the lotus heart, not only can it increase your comprehension, but it can also help you go into a state of enlightenment. With it, you can easily grasp the Sword Dao!” Lil’ Purple said with her eyes blazing. “The Sword Dao is one of the thirty-six Sovereign Daos, and many swordsmen might not be able to grasp it, even after spending a decade at the Quasi-Saint Realm.”

Lin Yun’s eyes lit up upon hearing that, and he said, “It looks like this is a great opportunity for me.”Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

But Lil' Purple took it away from him when he wanted to store it. She said, “I’ll keep it for now. I have some use for it.”

Lin Yun naturally had no opinion against that. If Lil’ Purple needed any treasures, he wouldn’t hesitate to give them to her. There was no longer a distinction between them. But it looked like this Sacred Fire Golden Lotus was really a treasure for even Lil’ Purple to lose her composure, which was rare.

When night came, Lin Yun wore the Silver Moon Mask and headed to the cave. The mountain range was bustling with people during the day, but Lin Yun didn’t run into anyone.

“This thing is really tough to retrieve. We can’t cut it away, and it looks like we can’t take it.”

“Those from the Eastern Desolation are too much to leave some scraps for us.”

“Ye Qingtian is too ruthless. If he didn’t stand out, Zhao Tianyu wouldn’t have stopped so easily.”

“He’s worthy of his ‘Holy Maiden Killer’ nickname…”

When Lin Yun approached the cave, he discovered some people. It looked like he wasn’t the only one after the tree. The cultivators from the other domains also shared the same thought but didn’t know the tree's origin. They were just trying to test their luck since they have failed to obtain anything during the day.

Lin Yun hid his aura, while the corner of his lips twitched upon hearing the nickname ‘Holy Maiden Killer’ from the crowd. He felt an urge to stand out and teach these people a lesson. “Since when did I become a Holy Maiden Killer?”

“Don’t bother struggling. There might be a wrong given name, but there’s no wrong nickname. Let these people probe the way for you, and don’t be in such a hurry to show yourself,” Lil’ Purple said, rolling her eyes.

Several people were surrounding the Golden Lotus Flametree, looking disappointed. They felt that this tree was extraordinary and that there might be other uses. They had no intention of digging it up because the conditions for transplanting such a tree were harsh. Instead, they were planning to cut the tree and bring it with them. But they realized that they couldn’t do anything to the tree after several attempts.

Hiding in the dark, Lin Yun noticed something unusual about the tree. The tree branches looked sinister in the darkness, like ominous weapons. They looked like they could ambush those people anytime.

“Let’s leave. This place is too eerie. This place was enveloped in a holy radiance during the day, but I didn’t expect it to be so eerie at night.” Someone spoke up, and his suggestion received everyone’s agreement. But before they left, they plucked all the leaves off of the tree.

This time, the Golden Lotus Flametree was bald. A long time after the group left, Lin Yun casually showed himself and came before the tree. The Golden Lotus Flametree had completely withered. Previously, it was a towering tree, but now it had shrunk from a hundred meters to ten.

Lin Yun used his fingers as a sword to hack the tree. But the collision only created metallic sounds with some faint traces left on the tree bark. He muttered, “There’s something weird about this.”

But that could mean anything, so Lin Yun retrieved the Flower Burial Sword after taking a deep breath. The Flower Burial Sword was sharp and pierced half an inch into the tree bark, causing a golden liquid to seep out from the cut. This shocked Lin Yun, and he exclaimed, “The Buddhist Emperor’s Saint Blood?”
