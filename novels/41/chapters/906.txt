Chapter 907 - Great Harvest!

Lin Yun’s words instantly made Xian Yunzhen freeze. He was especially terrified when he noticed the cold flash in Lin Yun’s pupils. If Lin Yun was this strong without his sword, Xian Yunzhen couldn’t imagine how powerful Lin Yun would become after using his sword.

Fear spread from Xian Yunzhen’s heart that immobilized him. Chen Qiong was shocked because he never would have thought that Xian Yunzhen would kneel on the ground so obediently. With that, one of them laid on the ground while the other kneeled on the ground.

This was the outcome of two geniuses from the higher realms even after working together. The spectators were dumbfounded and couldn’t even utter a single word. No one had expected this unbelievable outcome.

“Are they really geniuses from the higher realms?”

“They lost…?” An uproar broke out after a brief silence. Not only did Lin Yun take all the treasures in the Hidden Treasure Pavilion, but he even humiliated Chen Qiong and Xian Yunzhen.

The geniuses from the higher realms treated the other realms like livestock. So no one dared to compete with them in fear of being slaughtered. If Lin Yun wasn’t here, they wouldn’t even have the courage to spectate from afar.

“Lin Yun, let this come to an end. Let me go and the Violetyang Realm won’t come looking for you. This was just our personal grudge and I guarantee that I won’t pursue this any longer.” Chen Qiong hesitated for a long time before he made up his mind. He felt greatly humiliated right now.

“You’ve already obtained the treasures in the Hidden Treasure Pavilion. I can swear that the Myriadlight Realm won’t come looking for you,” said Xian Yunzhen.

Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with mockery as he retorted, “Come to an end? Let me off? Sorry, but I don’t intend on resolving this matter with your suggestion.”

Chen Qiong and Xian Yunzhen were jokers. They acted arrogantly and only decided to let him off after losing? Just how shameless were they? The foundation of the higher realms was terrifying, but Lin Yun was already prepared to face the worst the moment he made his move.

“What do you want?” Chen Qiong was completely dumbfounded by Lin Yun’s words. “Do you know the consequences of offending an entire higher realm?”

“Kill me and you’ll definitely regret it!” Xian Yunzhen said with a twisted face.

The smile on Lin Yun’s face disappeared as his immortal spiritual sword intent gushed out. As a hum permeated the surroundings, Lin Yun’s terrifying sword aura caused lightning to flash in the sky.

When Lin Yun took a step forward, the entire ground started to tremble under his sword intent. Chen Qiong and Xian Yunzhen’s faces had turned pale and it was hard for them to move under Lin Yun’s sword aura.

“Damn it. His sword intent is too strong.” Chen Qiong and Xian Yunzhen were completely shocked. Most importantly, they discovered that even their blood flow had been frozen. They knew that they were only a step away from death.

In that split second, their heartbeats froze as death loomed over them. At this moment, Lin Yun said coldly, “It looks like the two of you have no idea of your current situation. You have no right to speak, yet you continue to do so. I can let you live, but you need to hand over 2,000,000 astral pellets and a treasure that you found in Flamefeather City. Just to be clear, I don’t care which realm you come from.”

Lin Yun’s words were filled with killing intent that left the surrounding cultivators dumbfounded. Some people even wondered if their ears were messing with them. Someone from the Profound Amber Realm actually wants to blackmail two geniuses from the higher realms? At this moment, the unthinkable was happening.

Not only did Lin Yun defeat the higher realms, but he was even blackmailing them.

“My heavens. Am I hearing things?”

“He wants them to use their treasures to buy their lives. How insane!”

“A treasure that they found in Flamefeather City plus 2,000,000 astral pellets. Did I hear that right?” An uproar broke out after a brief moment of silence. Even Chen Qiong and Xian Yunzhen wondered if they heard Lin Yun correctly.

“Interesting. Was I not clear enough? It’s a pity that I don’t have a habit of repeating myself. Since you aren’t willing, you can’t blame me for being ruthless,” said Lin Yun indifferently.

“I’ll give them to you! I’ll give them to you!” yelled Chen Qiong. Ignoring Xian Yunzhen’s gaze, Chen Qiong took out 2,000,000 astral pellets from his interspatial pouch. Lil’ Red chuckled and took all of them.

“It looks like you’re missing something,” said Lin Yun.

Chen Qiong’s face changed when he heard that. The astral pellets might be a huge sum, but he could easily get that amount back by robbing others. So he didn’t feel much heartache when giving it away. But to get the treasures, he had to risk his life. He knew he didn’t have a choice, so he had to give it up.

Taking a deep breath, Chen Qiong took out a box from his interspatial pouch and said, “Fourth grade spiritualists are also known as Saint Spiritualists. There aren’t many of them even in Kunlun Realm and this is something that only Saint Spiritualists can refine. I think that you’ll be satisfied with this.”

Lil’ Red grabbed the box before opening it and tossing the pellet into its mouth. Chen Qiong’s lips twitched because it was difficult to get the pellet. However, the pellet was casually swallowed by the Dragon-blooded Cat.

“Farewell.” Chen Qiong gave Lin Yun a deep glance before he turned to leave without hesitation. He knew that today’s events would make him a joke in everyone’s eyes.

Xian Yunzhen’s face was pale before he gnashed his teeth to take out two million astral pellets and a pellet as well. Once again, Lil’ Red immediately swallowed the pellet. When Xian Yunzhen saw this, he couldn’t help vomiting blood.

Lil’ Red had already embarrassed him by opening the Hidden Treasure Pavilion’s gates, not to mention that it also took every single treasure from the Hidden Treasure Pavilion. Now, Lil’ Red was eating saint pellets like it was eating fruit.

Suppressing his anger, Xian Yunzhen looked at Lin Yun, “You’re reasonable after all. Killing me will only pit you against the Myriadlight Realm. But don’t think that I will let go of this grudge between us. You’ll regret this in the future!”

Xian Yunzhen was rather straightforward and didn’t try to hide the hatred in his heart. Facing Xian Yunzhen, Lin Yun spoke, “The two of you hadn’t crossed my bottom, which is why you were spared. You better cherish your life. Since I can let you go, I naturally have the strength to kill you with one sword.”

“You think I believe you?” Xian Yunzhen said coldly before he left.

Looking at Xian Yunzhen, Lin Yun smirked because the unknown was always the most terrifying one. Lin Yun wasn’t exaggerating when he said that he only needed one sword to kill Xian Yunzhen. Every single one of the Three Heavenly Divides was enough to kill Xian Yunzhen.

The spectators all stared at Lin Yun with disbelief. When Lin Yun turned around, they quickly fled for their lives. After all, Lin Yun was someone who could even blackmail geniuses from higher realms.

There was no doubt that Lin Yun’s fame would spread throughout Flamefeather City. After all, no one had blackmailed geniuses from the higher realms before.

Lin Yun couldn’t be bothered with the spectators because he still needed to sort through his harvest.FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“The 4,000,000 astral pellets and the greater fortune martial techniques are enough for Fang Shaoyu and the others to overcome their tribulation. Unfortunately, that greedy goofball ate both saint pellets.” Naturally, the saint pellets weren’t meant for Lin Yun since he had divine astral pellets, but he could have given them to his friends.

Calling Lil’ Red over, Lin Yun decided to sort through his harvest from the Hidden Treasure Pavilion. First, he grabbed the black dagger. The dagger looked like a short sword that could devour all light. When he stared at it, he felt his soul being sucked into the dagger.

He instantly knew that the dagger was a dao artifact. When he saw the name engraved on the shortsword, Lin Yun muttered, “Void Blade…”

When Lin Yun held the hilt, he could sense his vitality being devoured and that the dagger could easily tear apart space. Taking a few steps back, Lin Yun’s figure began to shuttle through illusion and reality. But a short moment later, he started gasping because this short moment had exhausted a third of his vitality. Lin Yun instantly loosened his grip on the dagger. He had never felt so weak before.

“How terrifying…” Lin Yun knew that the dao artifact was strong, but he didn’t have a cultivation technique that went along with it. However, Lil’ Red could rely on its powerful bloodline to use the dagger.

When Lil’ Red took the Void Blade from Lin Yun, it had joy written in its pupils.

“Don’t worry. It belongs to you,” smiled Lin Yun as he continued examining his harvest. First, he counted the divine astral pellets. He had a total of 18,000 pellets, which was more than he imagined. Then, he examined the imperial fortune martial technique, the Ten Profound Steps.

Although it was mentioned that one needed to be in the second soul Heavenly Soul Realm, Lin Yun could give it a try since he had cultivated the Seven Profound Steps that also belonged to the Sunchasing Art.

Finally, there was the Millennium Flame and dragon clan wine. The harvest from the Hidden Treasure Pavilion had far exceeded his imagination. When he turned back to look at the tattered Hidden Treasure Pavilion, Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts.

If this was the foundation of a branch clan, just how powerful was the branch clan when they were still alive? Lin Yun also began to wonder if the Mo Clan still existed in the Kunlun Realm.

While Lin Yun was thinking, a golden light shined brightly in Flamefeather City and lit up the entire sky. When Lin Yun turned around, his face had changed because he knew that the Glorysun Spirit was emerging.
