Chapter 760 - The Prodigal’s Return

The Falling Aquatic Empyrean’s reaction could have been worse. At this moment, the faces of the five old men standing before Lin Yun became awkward. They never expected to be in such an embarrassing position and they wanted to find a hole to hide in.

Who would’ve imagined that Lin Yun was the mysterious person standing on the Indigothunder Dragonvulture?! They were all greatly humiliated when Lin Yun killed the seven geniuses. When they recalled what they had just done, they could feel their faces burning from humiliation, especially Skycloud Sect’s sect master.

“Outrageous! Why are you here in Skymound City? Haven’t you embarrassed us enough?!” The face of Skycloud Sect’s sect master turned red as he roared with a trembling body.

“I’m leaving Thunder Prefecture from Flamedragon Hill, so I need to pass by Skymound City. What’s the matter? I can’t even pass by?” Lin Yun sneered at the old men.

“Sword slave, you’re courting death! You actually dare to come and humiliate me after killing my son? Do you really think you’re invincible because of the Indigothunder Dragonvulture?” The face of the Chen Clan’s patriarch was ugly because his son, Chen Ziyu, was killed by Lin Yun. If it wasn’t for the Falling Aquatic Empyrean, he would’ve killed Lin Yun a long time ago.

Who would have thought that Lin Yun would return. They couldn’t get Lin Yun’s words out of their minds as they had already determined that Lin Yun came on purpose to humiliate them.

“I would have forgotten about that if you didn’t show up. Well, it doesn’t matter. You’re no different than a piece of trash before the Indigothunder Dragonvulture.” Lin Yun spoke with killing intent in his eyes. He had already resolved his grudge with Skymound City once he killed the seven geniuses. But since someone dared to call him a sword slave, he wouldn’t mind teaching them a lesson.

Sensing Lin Yun’s killing intent, a powerful pressure was released from the Indigothunder Dragonvulture. Dragon runes began to squirm all over its body while the thunderclouds in the sky tumbled. The thunderclouds instantly covered the sky and turned everything black. The Indigothunder Dragonvulture’s purple dragon runes pushed its aura from an overlord demonic beast to that of a monarch.

The terrifying aura instantly crushed the five old men’s aura. Their angry expressions were replaced with fear. Then, the Skycloud Sect’s sect master spoke, “Young Master Lin, let’s all calm down. Did you say that you were just passing by? We’ll open a path for you immediately.”

“Too late. Lil’ Purple, smack him to death!” Lin Yun looked at the Chen Clan’s patriarch with his eyes flashing coldly.

The Indigothunder Dragonvulture’s massive body exploded with shocking speed as thirty dragon runes gathered onto its claw. Its claw flashed with blinding lightning as it descended like a comet onto Skymound City.

“Not good!” The face of the Chen Clan’s patriarch changed as he turned and ran. But in the next second, his pupils were filled with despair as he felt himself being restricted under the monarch demonic beast’s aura. It was hard for him to even turn around.

“Damn it!” Chen Clan’s patriarch cursed as he had no choice but to retaliate.

A resounding collision echoed out in mid-air and the Chen Clan’s patriarch fell to the ground like a broken kite. When the purple lightning spread out, the faces of the Skycloud Sect’s sect master and the patriarchs of the three major clans changed as all four of them vomited blood.

When the Chen Clan’s patriarch fell to the ground, his collision destroyed all the buildings within a ten mile radius. All of Skymound City could sense this tremor.

“How is this possible?!”

“Did the Chen Clan’s patriarch die?”

“Lin Yun! Why is he here again! Who can stop him now?”

“Holy shit, why did these people have to provoke this monster?”

The shocking scene in the sky was imprinted in everyone’s mind as horror spread throughout the city. When everyone felt the pressure, they fell to the ground and trembled in fear. They were afraid that Lin Yun would start a massacre. After all, Skymound City hadn’t been exactly friendly to Lin Yun ever since he first appeared.

When there were rumors of Lin Yun being killed by Chen Ziyu, the entire city even celebrated for a long time. But at this moment, they were consumed by fear. However, this was out of their guilty conscience.

Standing on the Indigothunder Dragonvulture, Lin Yun looked at the four remaining old men indifferently. These Heavenly Soul Realm experts were terrified and their faces turned pale from Lin Yun’s gaze. They were even willingly lowering their heads.

Even if they were unhappy, all they could do was suck it up. After all, the death of the Chen Clan’s patriarch was fresh in their minds. At this moment, the entire city lowered their heads to Lin Yun. None of the four old men dared to look at Lin Yun directly as this event would surely be the humiliation of their city for the next millennia.

They would become a laughingstock. How could several Heavenly Soul Realm experts tremble in fear and lower their heads to a young man.

Lin Yun retracted his gaze as he ignored them. Prior to this, he didn’t have any intention of going after them. He would only teach those who ran their mouths a lesson. Since they had lowered their heads, there was no reason to push them any further.

The Indigothunder Dragonvulture spread its wings that measured nearly a hundred meters. Dragon runes began to gather on its wings, causing them to glow brilliantly from the wind and lightning energies.

With a bolt of rumbling lightning, Lin Yun said, “Let’s go!”

In the next second, a violent wind that was accompanied by a dragon roar pressed down on everyone. Everyone had to close their eyes as they were nearly blown away. After the four old men stabilized themselves with great difficulty, Lin Yun had already traveled a few hundred miles away.

When everyone saw that Lin Yun had left, their eyes and mouths were wide open. Lin Yun had practically faced the entire city all by himself.

Mu Han turned to look down at his Iron-horned Falcon. It couldn’t compare to the Indigothunder Dragonvulture. Lin Yun was riding a dragon while he was basically riding a chicken.

“The difference is too great…” Mu Han said with an ugly expression.

“We’re letting him go?” The three patriarchs looked at Lin Yun with grievance written on their faces.

“What else can we do?” Skycloud Sect’s sect master glanced at them and snorted, “That Indigothunder Dragonvulture is now a monarch Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beast. You have no idea how terrifying it is. Didn’t you see Old Chen’s outcome?”

“Is Old Chen dead?” They finally recalled the Chen Clan’s patriarch now that someone mentioned it.

“Don’t poke your nose into it even if he isn’t dead. Old Chen offended Lin Yun the most. Look at his outcome now. Lin Yun is someone that holds a grudge, so who knows when he’ll come back.” The Skycloud Sect’s sect master waved his sleeve and left with a darkened expression.

The three patriarchs sighed as they shook their heads. In the end, none of them bothered to check on the Chen Clan’s patriarch. With the Draconic Banquet getting closer, all of the geniuses who went out had gradually returned.

“I wonder how they are doing now.” Lin Yun’s mind was on the Sword Firmament Pavilion. He wanted to meet his brothers and take a look at Guardian Plum. Lin Yun continued, “Lil’ Purple, a little faster please.”

As lightning flashed in the Indigothunder Dragonvulture’s pupils, it flapped its wings even faster and shuttled through the horizon.

Half a month later, at the gates of the Sword Firmament Pavilion, the atmosphere was tense. Wen Yanbo had been promoted to the position of the Primal Origin Sect’s sect master. So he stood before the Sword Firmament Pavilion with a darkened face.

Standing before the gates of the Sword Firmament Pavilion, Luo Feng’s face was ugly. He had no idea what Wen Yanbo did to reach the Heavenly Soul Realm half a year ago and became the strongest expert in the Great Qin Empire. He forcibly took over the Primal Origin Sect and allowed his sect to become the head of the four sects.

Over the past six months, the Sword Firmament Pavilion had many rough days. The Primal Origin Sect had acted arrogantly, which forced Guardian Plum to go into seclusion to make a breakthrough. After Guardian Plum went into seclusion, Wen Yanbo forcibly took over some of the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s businesses.

When he heard that Zuo Yun arrived at the Sword Firmament Pavilion, he demanded that they hand Zuo Yun over or else he would trample the Sword Firmament Pavilion. This was already his third attempt.

“Luo Feng, hand Zuo Yun over. Your Sword Firmament Pavilion is really bold to accept a traitor of my Primal Origin Sect. Are you guys tired of living?” asked Wen Yanbo coldly.

“Zuo Yun was invited over by Lin Yun. Stop dreaming that we’ll hand him over to you,” said Luo Feng.

“Lin Yun? Haha, if he dares to come back, I’ll make him kneel before me!” Wen Yanbo sneered. He had become a lot more arrogant after reaching the Heavenly Soul Realm. “That bastard wants to participate in the Draconic Banquet? I can cripple him with one hand!”

The Primal Origin Sect has suffered greatly in the past because of Lin Yun. Even Wen Yanbo’s beloved disciple Heartcliff was killed by Lin Yun in the Dragon Gate Competition.

“That’s enough. I’ll go with you guys,” said Zuo Yun. He never imagined that he would bring so much trouble to the Sword Firmament Pavilion.

“No way.” Luo Feng said as he stepped in front of Zuo Yun to block him. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“No way? You’re overestimating your strength,” said Wen Yanbo with disdain on his face. These pieces of trash have no idea how terrifying a Heavenly Soul Realm expert is. He threw his palm forward and broke Luo Feng’s ribs, making him spit up blood.

“You dare stand before me when you can’t even take half my palm?” Wen Yanbo spoke coldly as he released his aura, causing the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s disciples and elders to tremble. In an instant, he had immobilized everyone.

Wen Yanbo was practically invincible at this moment, bringing pride to the faces of the Primal Origin Sect’s disciples and elders. This was the power of a Heavenly Soul Realm expert!

“Traitor, get over here!” Wen Yanbo roared, unleashing a terrifying shockwave that shook the eardrums of the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s party. Even Zuo Yun’s face had become ugly.

“Do you refuse? Looks like I’ll have to show you some force to make you crawl over.” Wen Yanbo laughed as he was about to shatter Zuo Yun’s knees.

But right at this moment, a loud booming rang out that caused the entire heaven and earth to tremble. An azure figure stood on a colossal beast with a sword box strapped to his back. It was Lin Yun. “Old geezer, I’ll destroy your entire sect if you dare to touch a strand of his hair!”

“Junior Brother Lin!” Everyone from the Sword Firmament Pavilion cheered when they saw him. Their blood boiled in excitement because the legend had finally returned to the sect.
