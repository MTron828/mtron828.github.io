Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

When everyone looked at Yu Haotian, they were shocked to discover that he had reached the fourth soul Heavenly Soul Realm. After reaching the third soul Heavenly Soul Realm, each tribulation was life and death.

After making it through the tribulation, one’s strength would greatly soar. If one had a deep foundation, they might even have an astral flame temper their soul and lightning temper their physique. Based on the strength Yu Haotian had revealed, there was a high possibility that he had faced astral flames in his tribulation.

What was even more shocking was the fact that he had just reached the initial third soul Heavenly Soul Realm when he arrived at the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm. No one could imagine what Yu Haotian obtained in the test to boost his strength so much.

When Yu Haotian looked at Jun Mengchen, the surrounding atmosphere became tense. No one could tell what Yu Haotian was trying to do. Was he going to make a move against Jun Mengchen?

That thought was dismissed after a moment of thinking. After all, Jun Mengchen, Qin Lin, and Luo Chen were always together. So unless Yu Haotian was insane, he wouldn’t try and provoke Jun Mengchen.

“Jun Mengchen, why don’t you repeat what you said?” Yu Haotian smiled while looking down on Jun Mengchen. The plaza clamored at Yu Haotian’s blatant provocation. Jun Mengchen was one of the seven heads and those from higher realms didn’t dare to be rude to him.

Did Yu Haotian actually take the initiative to provoke Jun Mengchen? This scene made Luo Chen frown as he pulled Jun Mengchen back. “Yu Haotian, give me some face and put an end to this.”

Does Luo Chen want to settle this matter peacefully? Yu Haotian’s eyes flashed with ridicule as he grinned, “Sure, let me take a look at all of your inheritances and I’ll let this matter go. Otherwise, don’t say I didn’t warn you. Even if you guys are the seven heads, the three of you won’t have a good outcome!”

Everyone was dumbfounded by Yu Haotian’s words. They were astounded by Yu Haotian’s arrogance. Not only did he slap Jun Mengchen in the face, but he even disregarded Luo Chen, who was the chief of the seven heads. Is Yu Haotian courting death?

Everyone looked at Yu Haotian as if they were looking at a madman. Even if Yu Haotian was in the fourth soul Heavenly Soul Realm, that was no reason to be arrogant. After all, there was a reason why Luo Chen was known as the chief of the seven heads.

When Jun Mengchen heard that, he spoke coldly, “Big brother, it looks like he has completely disregarded us. I have no idea where he gets his confidence from when he just reached the fourth soul Heavenly Soul Realm. It looks like we’ll have to teach how to behave. You want our inheritance? Dream on! I’ll make you hand yours over instead!”

After Jun Mengchen was done, a terrifying aura exploded out of his body while he emitted a dazzling purple radiance and lightning energy. At this moment, he looked like a lightning god with his pupils filled with lightning. But this time, Luo Chen didn’t stop him because he knew that there was no way they could resolve this matter peacefully now or else Yu Haotian would think that they were really afraid of him.

“Die!” Pushing his aura to the limit, Jun Mengchen roared and disappeared. When he reappeared, he was in front of Yu Haotian.At the moment, his lightning was so strong that the radiance covered the entire plaza. It was enough to make the spectators nervous.

Just when everyone thought that Yu Haotian would be defeated by a single attack, Yu Haotian didn’t even move. Instead, a white brilliance shined out of his body as he met Jun Menghen’s attack with a punch of his own. Jun Mengchen was surprised because he didn’t hold back, but Yu Haotian actually managed to take his attack head-on.

He threw another punch that manifested into a lightning dragon that charged towards Yu Haotian. But Yu Haotian took the attack head-on again.

“H-how is this possible?!” yelled Jun Mengchen in disbelief. He couldn’t believe that Yu Haotian was actually able to take his strongest attack head-on so easily. Without a second thought, he decided to retreat.

But before he could even retreat, Yu Haotian sneered as a silver moon appeared on his palm, “You think you can run?”

As a gigantic silver winged human appeared behind him when he clenched his fist. Jun Mengchen was shocked to discover that his movement was restricted with the appearance of the winged human. When Yu Haotian’s fist reached him, Jun Mengchen’s origin energy was shattered. The blow instantly broke all of his ribs and disrupted his organs.

Jun Mengchen threw up a mouthful of blood as he fell to the ground with a pale face. Yu Haotian pushed down on Jun Mengchen’s head and laughed, “Kneel!”

The spectators were stupifed because Yu Haotian defeated Jun Mengchen in just three punches. “Holy shit! How did he manage to do it?!”

“He defeated Jun Mengchen in three punches?” All eyes were on Yu Haotian. Even Qin Lin’s face had changed as he jumped to his feet.

“Yu Haotian, are you courting death?!” Qin Ling roared.

“You’re not qualified to speak with me. I initially wanted to swap inheritances, but I can only help myself to yours since you guys didn’t want any face,” smiled Yu Haotian coldly.

“Swap inheritances? How is that a swap? You clearly want to snatch!” Qin Ling roared.

Yu Haotian wasn’t bothered by what he said and smiled, “You can think anyway you want. But you’re not exactly wrong.”

Right at this moment, a terrifying aura soared into the sky that caused the entire plaza to start trembling with a terrifying chill. This made everyone feel a chill down their spine because there was a terrifying killing intent mixed in that chill.

“It’s Luo Chen!”

“He’s enraged!”

Everyone’s face changed when Luo Chen stood up from his stage with killing intent filled in his eyes. But Yu Haotian had no fear written on his face and laughed, “I told you! You’re not qualified to speak to me.”

“You!” Qin Lin’s face became green when he heard that because Yu Haotian was looking down on him publicly.

Luo Chen looked at Yu Haotian and said, “Yu Haotian, we don’t have any grudges between us. Do you have to push it this far?”

“Is that so? Wasn’t Brother Mengchen acting arrogantly earlier? Why do you guys want to reason with me now that he’s kneeling? Don’t worry, you’re next. Seven heads or not, you’re nothing in my eyes. Even you barely have the qualification to speak to me,” smiled Yu Haotian.

Yu Haotian’s words had left everyone shocked because they never expected that he would be so arrogant. After all, Luo Chen was the chief of the seven heads.

When Luo Chen heard that, his eyes flashed coldly, “You think you’re comparable to Lin Yun just because the two of you are from the same realm?”

Upon hearing Lin Yun’s name, Yu Haotian stopped smiling, “What do you think I’m doing right now? You guys are only the appetizer. It’ll be Lin Yun’s turn when he’s out. When he kneels before me, you’ll know the difference between us. He’s nothing but a clown in my eyes. I, Yu Haotian, am the strongest from the Ancient Southern Domain and he’s nothing! NOTHING!”

With Yu Haotian’s face changing so drastically at the mention of Lin Yun’s name, the crowd knew that Yu Haotian had a deep seeded hatred for Lin Yun. The grudge was much deeper than anyone could have imagined.

“You’ll regret it,” said Luo Chen indifferently.

“Cut the crap. The two of you can come at me together. Otherwise, don’t blame me for not giving you a chance,” replied Yu Haotian coldly. When he finished, a black glove appeared before him. The glove was blazing with bizarre flames as if it could even burn through space. Astral flames!

“Chief of the seven heads? You are nothing in my eyes…” Yu Haotian wore the glove on his right hand as disdain flashed through his eyes.
