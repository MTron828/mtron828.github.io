Chapter 1017 - Profound Iron Demonic Apes

Just by hearing the name Divine Blood Fruit, Lin Yun knew that it was an extraordinary treasure. He never expected that Pei Xue would have something so precious on her, not to mention that Yue Weiwei also had one. Didn’t that mean that Yue Weiwei was also under the pursuit of the war realms?

Lin Yun didn’t understand what the Divine Blood Fruit was, but he also didn’t ask too much about it. Very quickly, the horde of demonic beasts surrounded them as several figures made their way over from afar.

When Lin Yun squinted his eyes over, he could sense several powerful aura coming from the horde. Clearly, there were dozens of overlord demonic beasts who were in the fourth soul Heavenly Soul Realm. There were even several monarch demonic beasts in the horde.

“Kill me if there’s no other way and take the Divine Blood Fruit. When you reach the Four Phase City, help me give it to the Imperial Diagram War Realm. I was injured previously and now my injuries are too heavy,” said Pei Xue in an emotional voice. However, she still had a trace of hope in her eyes. She wasn’t optimistic that she could leave the Yellow Sandy Plain, but that wasn’t as bad as bogging Lin Yun down in her mess.

In her opinion, it was just a matter of time before they were captured from the three war realms. After all, they joined hands with dozens of higher realms. Additionally, Pei Xue recognized the person who was controlling the horde, Beast King Nie Xuan from the Nether Divinity War Realm.

He was even more terrifying than the Profound Lightning Twin Swords as a demonic beast and human mix. Not only could he manipulate demonic beasts, but he was also one of the four generals of the Nether Divinity War Realm.

“How far are we from the Lunar Soul Herb?” Lin Yun asked while carrying Pei Xue on his back.

“At least two days from now,” replied Pei Xue. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Let’s go then.” After he secured Pei Xue to his back, he got Lil’ Red to follow from behind while he activated the Golden Crow Nine Transformations.

Two days later, Lin Yun was still pursued by a demonic beast. It was a humanoid demonic beast, a Profound Iron Demonic Ape that was covered in black scales and shrouded in demonic aura. It was in the pinnacle fourth soul Heavenly Soul Realm and had a cold luster on its scales.

It charged over without any hesitation when it discovered Lin Yun. It was over ten feet tall with fingers that looked like iron hooks.

Lin Yun didn’t stop running and activated the Azure Dragon Saint Armor. Colliding with the Profound Iron Demonic Ape, Lin Yun sent the demonic beast flying as its fingers were destroyed. When it fell to the ground and raised its head, the Profound Iron Demonic Ape’s pupils were filled with dense fear. It was almost like Lin Yun was the demonic beast instead.

Right at this moment, dozens of Profound Iron Demonic Apes charged over. They were all enveloped in golden scales and were clearly a lot stronger than the previous ape. However, these ones were overlord demonic beasts.

Pei Xue laid on Lin Yun’s back with deep shock in her eyes. After all, these overlord Profound Iron Demonic Apes were emitting terrifying vitality. Every single one could make it on the ranking, not to mention that their bodies were comparable to dao artifacts.

Lin Yun locked his brows together because there were too many apes. It wouldn’t be easy for him to deal with them. After all, these overlord Profound Iron Demonic Apes were practically invincible existences in the Yellow Sandy Plain. Since they were forced to come together, they were even more unstoppable.

The surface of Lin Yun’s body began to flicker with purple and golden dragon runes while the Divine Sun Breaking Seal bloomed in the palm of his hand. When he moved, he released a terrifying aura. In the next second, Lin Yun’s punch created a hole in a Profound Iron Demonic Ape. Just like that, many of the demonic apes were killed after several exchanges.

“Roar!” A demonic ape emitted golden light from the center of its brows while its fists burned like a star. It was strong, and it managed to destroy the aura of Lin Yun’s punch with a single attack. In the end, Lin Yun was forced backwards.

As the remaining demonic apes surrounded him, fists full of bright light kept attacking Lin Yun. It was a bitter battle against fifteen overlord Profound Iron Demonic Apes. There was one specific Profound Iron Demonic Ape that was especially powerful because it was nearly twenty feet tall.

Lin Yun was strong, but he was handicapped with Pei Xue on his back. If it was an ordinary overlord demonic beast, Lin Yun could easily kill them with a single punch.

“Don't worry about me. Leave after you obtain the Lunar Soul Herb.” Pei Xue’s face was pale with despair deep in her heart. If Nie Xuan caught up to them right now, they would have no other paths of retreat.

At that time, the Realm Sons would catch up to them. Nie Xuan alone would be tough for them to deal with, not to mention three Realm Sons.

The moment she was done speaking, Lin Yun tossed her to the ground. Her face was enraged for a moment, but she accepted her fate. With tears welling up in her eyes, Pei Xue spoke, “Kill me and retrieve the Divine Blood Fruit. Please, help me give it to the Imperial Diagram War Realm…”

When Lin Yun saw this scene, he replied, “Who wants your Divine Blood Fruit? Close your eyes.”

He only found it troublesome to draw his sword, so he dropped Pei Xue on the ground. Taking advantage of Lin Yun’s break, the demonic apes charged over. At this moment, Pei Xue’s face turned pale just thinking about her body being torn into a million pieces.

“Am I that weak? I haven’t even drawn my sword…” Lin Yun muttered before he retrieved his sword with boundless fighting spirit. As soon as the Flower Burial Sword was in his hands, his temperament underwent a drastic transformation. Now, Lin Yun looked like a fiend from hell.

“Die!” Lin Yun’s face turned cold as he unleashed his sky sword intent. Soaring into the sky, Lin Yun unleashed fifteen swords that targeted all fifteen demonic apes. Every single one of his attacks pierced the hearts of the apes.

When Lin Yun landed on the ground, the demonic apes collapsed. Sensing that everything had calmed down, Pei Xue carefully opened her eyes only to be shocked by what she was seeing. All of the demonic apes were killed when she closed her eyes.

Not far away was the back of an azure clothed youth. At this moment, blood was dripping down from his sword. Lin Yun turned around, wiping the sweat off his forehead and sheathing his sword. The demonic apes were stronger than he had imagined, even after bringing out his sky sword intent. If he didn’t know about their vital spots, he probably would have to spend a lot of effort to kill them.

“They’re all dead?” Pei Xue was shocked by this scene as she looked at Lin Yun with disbelief. The overlord demonic apes were as tough as dao artifacts. However, they were slain despite their tough skin.

“What else would you expect? I drew my sword, so how could I leave any of them alive?” replied Lin Yun before he dealt with the injury on his chest. This injury was left behind by the leader of the demonic apes, which nearly broke his rib. If it wasn’t for the Azure Dragon True Bone, then he would have been heavily injured.

“You’re too terrifying, just how did you…” Pei Xue was shocked because she knew how strong the apes were. Who would have thought that Lin Yun was even more terrifying?

“Is it that unbelievable? Even the Profound Lightning Twin Swords lost to me. What did you think would happen?” replied Lin Yun. Although it was slightly dangerous to face so many demonic beasts, everything was still within Lin Yun’s control. After dealing with his injuries, Lin Yun looked at Pei Xue and continued, “I'm an extraordinary talent. Plus, it’s not like this is the first time you’ve seen me fight.”

Pei Xue was speechless when she heard that and she no longer wanted to talk to Lin Yun. It was true that Lin Yun was an extraordinary talent, but he hadn’t risen to prominence quite yet. Defeating the Profound Lightning Twin Swords and fifteen overlord demonic beasts were two entirely different concepts. Naturally, the latter was more dangerous because the Profound Iron Demonic Apes had a stronger physique and bloodline than ordinary demonic beasts.

“It looks like that person found us…” Lin Yun looked into the distance and sensed a terrifying aura. The other party had sensed his sky sword intent and was observing him from afar.

The reason why Lin Yun hadn’t been using his sword was because he didn’t want to expose his location. Although the other party had already discovered him through the demonic beasts, using his sky sword intent was akin to providing a beacon to his enemies.

“That’s Beast King Nie Xuan of the Nether Divinity War Realm, one of the four generals.” Sensing the aura, Pei Xue’s expression became nervous.

“Generals?” Lin Yun asked.

“In the Ten War Realms, everyone aside from the main clan is a servant. But servants are also divided into different ranks. Generals are the highest-ranking servants with the qualification to take in their own servants. They’re the direct vessels of the Realm Sons. The Profound Lightning Twin Swords that you defeated aren’t weak, but they’re still far from being generals,” explained Pei Xue.

“Is he strong?” questioned Lin Yun.

“Very,” said Pei Xue with a grave expression.

“Oh.” Lin Yun nodded his head, which baffled Pei Xue. Before she could respond, Lin Yun placed her on his back once more and headed towards the Demonic Wolf Clan.

“Y-y-you! Put me down! My injuries have gotten better and I can walk by myself…” Pei Xue blushed when Lin Yun placed her on his back without warning.

“Why are you making such a huge fuss? This isn’t the first time anyway,” replied Lin Yun.

“W-w-what do you mean by that! Put me down, you idiot!” Pei Xue blushed as she began to struggle behind Lin Yun.

“I wish, but you’re too slow. You’re even slower than Lil’ Red,” replied Lin Yun. He ignored her and continued to travel with the Golden Crow Nine Transformations.

“Lil’ Red? Who’s that?” Pei Xue was baffled when she heard the name Lil’ Re’. Could it be that this Lil’ Red was another lover of Lin Yun?

“There.” Lin Yun pointed his finger in a direction. When Pei Xue turned her head, she saw Lil’ Red grinning at her. Her face immediately turned dark. Just how is that despicable cat red?
