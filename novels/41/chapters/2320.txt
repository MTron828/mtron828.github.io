Chapter 2321 - Big Shot?

Just as Lin Jiangxian had told Lin Yun. There were many treasures in the Blood Mist Swamp, but they paled in comparison to the Supreme Monument. So there’s no need to give up something more critical for insignificant things.

“Is the Sovereign Monument that magical?” Lin Yun asked curiously.

“That’s right. I’ll be waiting for you at the Sovereign Monument,” Lin Jiangxian straightforwardly replied. Although she didn't show excessive warmth to them, she gave them enough attention.

"Alright, I will see you at the Sovereign Monument," Lin Yun nodded, before leaving with Ji Zixi.

While looking at them departing, Xi Ruo coldly remarked, “At least he has some self-awareness, knowing not to be a burden to us. So he’s not that bad.”

Chang Jun chuckled, “I think he’s just greedy, believing he can make a name for himself in this Blood Mist Swamp."

“He’s simply dreaming.” Chang Jun and Xi Ruo whispered amongst themselves, drawing Lin Jiangxian’s attention and causing them to quiet down.

Lin Jiangxian’s gaze was sharp, and she said, “He will be restricted if he’s with you guys. They’re not ordinary, and it’s enough if they can reach the Sovereign Monument in time.”

“What?!” Everyone was shocked, especially Chang Jun and Xi Ruo, who had disbelief on their faces.

After bidding farewell to the Heavenly Sword Pavilion, Ji Zixi and Lin Yun executed their movement techniques and sped up their pace. They passed by many places and stopped after verifying that they had traveled far enough to avoid people. After traveling for about a hundred miles, they noticed a faint fire in the blood mist that caused them to stop.

When they got close, they discovered that there was a fruit in the flame that resembled a jade. Ji Zii instantly recognized it, and said, “Exquisite Saint Fruit!”

It was also known as Exquisite Jade since it was only recorded in ancient books in the Kunlun Realm. They had disappeared over time. If a Saint consumes them, it could temper their bloodline and strengthen their internal organs. This was a treasure to someone who possessed a divine physique, and the effects of cultivating for a hundred years might not be comparable to this fruit.

The Exquisite Saint Fruit shimmered with light that seemed to be breathing the surrounding spiritual energy. When rustling sounds were heard, the Exquisite Saint Fruit immediately burrowed into the swamp.

Lin Yun was agile and lunged forth to capture it. But a red light suddenly flashed from the incredibly fast swamp. The red light shattered Lin Yun’s multiple afterimages before he was struck by it. The moment he was struck, the red light wrapped around him with poison, trying to seep into his body. When he got close, he discovered the red light was a long tongue.

The tongue wrapped around Lin Yun and dragged him over, revealing a massive lizard mouth. The lizard’s tongue was faster than a Saint, but Lin Yun’s sword intent was even faster. When a sword ray flew out, the lizard’s head exploded.

“Big Brother Lin, are you alright?” Ji Zixi asked worriedly.

“The tongue was poisonous, and even a sixth-stage Saint Lord might not be able to bear it. But I’m fine since I have the Blue Dragon Bone,” Lin Yun said while swinging his sword, causing the swamp to explode and revealing several corpses.

When he swept his gaze over, he suddenly squinted and reached out, dragging the Exquisite Saint Fruit over, “I finally found you! Azure Dragon’s Grasp!”

After he merged the Azure Dragon Divine Rune into the Azure Dragon’s Grasp, the power had reached a whole new height.

“The Exquisite Saint Fruit should share a symbiotic relationship with the lizard. The saint fruit is responsible for luring people over while the lizard attacks before dividing the spoils,” Lin Yun said, surveying the bodies in the swamp. After a brief examination of the Exquisite Saint Fruit, Lin Yun and Ji Zixi continued their journey.

Half an hour later, they ran into trouble again. Frighteningly long worms had shot out like arrows. They possessed sharp teeth, and they looked menacing. With a wave of his hand, Lin Yun unleashed his sword intent, and the worms exploded before they could even get close, intimidating the other demonic beasts in the swamp. They could see corpses lying around the ground as they continued their journey.

“The Blood Mist Swamp is more dangerous than I thought. The blood mist contains poison, and the demonic beasts living here are tough to deal with,” Lin Yun said with a grave expression. He was fortunate that he had the Blue Dragon Bone and Divine Light Sword Intent. The Blue Dragon Bone could resolve any poison, while the sword intent could destroy all of his enemies.

As they traveled, they would run into many bizarre demonic beasts, which they would simply kill. If Lin Yun couldn’t kill them within three moves, he wouldn’t stay around since he didn’t want to stay in the same place for long. Their efforts proved to be rewarding since they acquired multiple more fruits aside from the Exquisite Saint Fruit.

Suddenly, Lin Yun’s chest trembled. The Flower Burial Sword had sensed something.

“There’s an exotic flower!” Based on the Flower Burial Sword’s reaction, Lin Yun was practically confident that an exotic flower existed. He followed the Flower Burial Sword’s guidance and found an enormous skeletal structure that looked imposing, like a city. This was the corpse of a pure-blooded demonic beast!

But with Lin Yun’s limited experience, he couldn’t recognize what beast this was.

“Big Brother Lin, look!” Ji Zixi pointed at an unusual stone in the jumbled bones.

Upon closer inspection, Lin Yun realized it wasn't a stone but an extremely tough organ. The Flower Burial Sword began to vibrate before Lin Yun threw his punch at the ‘stone’ without hesitation, but he failed to budge the ‘stone’ since there weren’t any cracks on it.

“This is weird,” Lin Yun furrowed his brow. He had used his sword intent in his punch, but he failed to damage it. Just when he was feeling uneasy, Ji Zixi used her phoenix fire. The organ was tough, but it began to dissolve under the phoenix fire. Ji Zixi then gave Lin Yun a smile and a wink.

“Impressive,” Lin Yun said, praising her. The Divine Light Sword Intent was powerful, but the organ was tougher. After the organ dissolved, no exotic flower could be seen but a grey substance that emitted a fragrance. As they closely looked at it, they noticed that countless patterns on it looked like bright stars.

“That’s the Dragon Amber with the Gloryfire Spirit engraved on it!” Lin Yun rejoiced as he summoned the Flower Burial Sword. This wasn’t an exotic flower, but was even more precious than an exotic flower. The Flower Burial Sword was now a Fourspirit Glory Saint Artifact, and it could become a Fivespirit Glory Saint Artifact if it could devour this Dragon Amber, becoming one step closer to a Sovereign Saint Artifact.

When the fragrance entered the Flower Burial Sword, Lin Yun and Ji Zixi could sense the surrounding temperature increasing.

Suddenly, Ji Zixi whispered, “There’s someone else here.”

The commotion caused by the Flower Burial Sword was great, and it was natural for nearby cultivators to be attracted. Four figures could be seen approaching from a distance, radiating with an aggressive aura. They were giving off a powerful murderous intent, which identified them as demonic cultivators.

When the four landed, their eyes lit up with joy on their faces.

“So a powerful sword appeared here! I didn’t expect it to be the Gloryspirit Dragon Amber!”

“This brat is really lucky!”

“He’s lucky, but he’s a little stupid to stand here and devour such a treasure so openly.”

“If he’s not stupid, how would that give us an opportunity?”

“Hahaha!” The four were all fifth-stage Saint Lords. So they naturally didn’t place Lin Yun and Ji Zixi in their eyes and greed was radiating from their eyes.

But Lin Yun made the first move. A powerful aura swept out from him, leaving the four demonic cultivators taken aback. The murderous intent je had unleashed was too terrifying. Before the four could respond, a dragon’s claw descended from the sky with a divine rune blooming at the center with thunderstorms following behind. Since a powerful suction force was unleashed, the four demonic cultivators were dragged over.

When Lin Yun reached out, the four demonic cultivators were crushed with their blood raining down when Lin Yun stopped moving. Their saint souls and saint physiques were completely ripped apart and they couldn’t be any more dead. The reason why Lin Yun was so brutal was to intimidate anyone in the surroundings.

As expected, several figures retreated, aghast. This was because Lin Yun was even more brutal than demonic cultivators like them.

“Hehe. It's impressive that you have grasped the long-lost Dragon Clan’s martial technique, the Azure Dragon’s Grasp. I heard that only the sect master of the Dragon’s Gate knew about it.” An eerie laughter resounded. There were bound to be people who weren’t intimidated by Lin Yun. This person had a pale face and was enveloped in a baleful aura when he appeared.

The baleful aura that he gave off was powerful, and he was a sixth-stage Saint Lord who had tugged his arms together. This youth had a vicious gaze and looked calm, as though he had seen through Lin Yun. He said, “You’re ruthless, but I have long noticed your weakness. Your saint dao is pale in comparison to the other sects’ geniuses, and you will fall into a disadvantageous position in an hour if you engage in a fight.”

Ji Zixi took a look at the Flower Burial Sword that was still devouring the Dragon Amber and moved closer to Lin Yun.

Lin Yun said, “Since that’s the case, why didn’t you make a move? According to what you say, I should be a dead person in an hour.”

“We’re all smart people, so why beat around the bush? I’m naturally afraid of you. Aside from the Azure Dragon’s Grasp, you must possess other martial techniques as well, and I will also suffer if I’m not careful,” the youth smiled. “So why don’t we negotiate? Share half of the Dragon Amber with me. I’m a big shot at the sixth-stage Saint Lord, and you should be satisfied that someone like me is taking a step back for you.”

A big shot? Since when can a sixth-stage Saint Lord be known as a big shot? But Lin Yun suddenly realized that he hadn’t killed a sixth-stage Saint Lord before, so he smiled, “The Azure Cloud Realm has three demonic sects, the Suspension Palace, Blood Bone Gate, and Golden Jade Pavilion. Which one do you hail from?”

“The Golden Jade Pavilion,” the youth said pridefully.

“Oh.” Lin Yun soared to the sky with his Divine Light Sword Intent unleashed and his temperament changing.

“I have guessed it…” The youth was surprised. He had already expected that Lin Yun still had trump cards, but he wasn’t expecting the Divine Light Sword Intent. But the youth quickly calmed down after the initial shock. Since he already predicted that Lin Yun still had trump cards, he naturally wouldn’t come out unprepared.

But before he could do anything, a flower ignited like fire on Lin Yun’s shoulder. The flower was the Othershore Flower, which flew to the sky. The youth panicked while sinking into the illusion that was created by the Othershore Flower.

When he came to his senses, he saw that his body had become as light as a leaf as he drifted away from Lin Yun. Seeing his decapitated body, he finally realized that Lin Yun had decapitated him just when he fell into the illusion. With that, a genius of the Golden Jade Pavilion had died.

But this had nothing to do with Lin Yun. He merely released his Divine Light Sword Intent and unleashed an attack. He caught the Othershore Flower descending from the sky. The flower bud was blazing, and a divine rune could be faintly seen.

When the headless corpse fell to the ground, worms burrowed out from the ground and soon devoured the corpse.

“A big shot? Since when is a sixth-stage Saint Lord considered a big shot?” Lin Yun said with contempt as he stowed the Othershore Flower.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m
