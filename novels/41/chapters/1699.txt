Chapter 1700 – Celestial Dance (2)

What Lin Yun said gave her tremendous insight. When she looked at Lin Yun again, her pupils had admiration. If the Prairie Phoenix Fire was a coincidence, then she had to admit that Lin Yun had reached an unbelievable height in his music dao when he pointed out the true profundity of the Ni Chang Dress Song.

“Lin Xiao, you’ve really given me a surprise.” Mu Xueling said sincerely.

“It’s just some shallow understanding. There’s no way I can be compared to Saint Elder when it comes to music dao.” Lin Yun replied.

“You don’t have to be humble. You’re not simple, and the Heavenly Origin Mirror has discovered your secrets. But I’m surprised that you have such a shocking attainment in music dao as well. You’re right, I have to let you take a look at the Profound Fairy because the dress needs something real to make it look unrealistic.” Mu Xueling said as she waved her hand, splitting apart the snowflakes and fog.

The scene before them was like a mirror with the fog clearing up, ultimately fixating on the woman dancing on the lake. She was ten miles away, but it felt like she was just beyond his reach.

But Lin Yun still hadn’t come to his senses from what Mu Xueling had said earlier. His secret was discovered? Was his actual appearance discovered? But if his true appearance were discovered, Mu Xueling definitely wouldn’t conceal it for him. Then, it would either be his Blue Dragon Bone, the broken sword, or one of his other secrets.

Just when Lin Yun’s thoughts were in a mess, a person appeared within the mirror. When he looked at that person's appearance, he was stumped, and all the chaotic thoughts in his mind dispersed. He widened his mouth in disbelief, looking at the woman.

He recalled the young lady playing the flute by the lakeside back in the Profound Amber Realm, their encounter in the Yin Wind Stream, reuniting during the Draconic Banquet, and how they said farewell on the Heavenly Path as she gave him the Divine Jade Bamboo Flute. Multiple scenes flashed within his mind from his memories. The young lady was naturally Yue Weiwei. He never expected that the Profound Fairy would be Yue Weiwei.

When Yue Weiwei turned around in the mirror-like screen and bumped into his gaze, Lin Yun’s heart throbbed, and he nearly lost his composure. He didn’t know if he should respond if Yue Weiwei suddenly called out ‘Big Brother Lin.’

But before he could think about it, the screen gradually faded, and the scenes became blurred once more. At this moment, Lin Yun finally came to his senses, and he knew that Yue Weiwei didn’t see him since she was focused on the Nine Heavenly Profound Dance. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Due to the snowflakes, there was no way she could take a closer look at Lin Yun’s face since they were ten miles away. Even if she could see him, she would only see an unfamiliar face.

Mu Xueling wasn’t surprised when she saw Lin Yun dazing off. She said, “Do you know why I didn’t want you to look at her?”

But Lin Yun was still distracted, as if he didn’t hear what she said. This made Mu Xueling furrow her brows, and she asked, “Lin Xiao? Lin Xiao?”

When she called out to Lin Yun twice, Lin Yun finally came to his senses, and he replied, “Sorry about that. I was a little distracted, earlier.”

“You’ve seen the Profound Fairy before?” Mu Xueling asked.

“No, I’ve never seen her before.” Lin Yun sat down and took out the Thunderstorm Zither. “Let us begin now.”

Before Mu Xueling could say anything, Lin Yun sat down on a boulder. Since it was Yue Weiwei whom he was playing for, there was naturally no need for him to refuse. Even if Mu Xueling didn’t give him any Profound Saint Pellets for his effort, he would still do his best because it was for Yue Weiwei, and that was enough for him.

While zither music quickly resounded, Lin Yun had already started playing the Ni Chang Dress Song before Mu Xueling could respond. He was earnest in playing it, and his attention was all on the zither. Occasionally, he would take a glance in Yue Weiwei’s direction.

On the other hand, Mu Xueling was surprised. She initially wanted to give Lin Yun a few reminders, but she was already too late since he had already started playing. The pace Lin Yun was playing at was a lot faster than before, and Mu Xueling soon forgot about everything. Looking at how Lin Yun was focused and his ten fingers dancing on the zither, she was quickly captivated by his music. She had to admit that Lin Yun was really dashing.

As for Yue Weiwei, who was focused on dancing on the lake, she soon noticed that something wasn’t right as rainbow threads descended from the sky. She instantly knew someone was playing the Ni Chang Dress Song, and she soon came to her senses.

She had some reluctance for this song. This was why she couldn't reach a rapport, even if she could force herself to accept it. No matter how perfect the song was, it couldn’t compliment her and would only mess up her dance.

She initially thought that her Aunt and Senior Sister had already given up on it, but it appeared that they still wanted to give it a try again. Yue Weiwei naturally knew that her Aunt and Senior Sister were doing this for her, and she also didn’t want to disappoint them. Thus, she tried to reach a rapport with the zither music.

Initially, she wasn’t too bothered by it, but she soon discovered that she had reached a rapport with the music. Rainbows shone down from the sky that formed into threads that enveloped her. She soon forgot about the zither music and was soon submerged in the Nine Heavenly Profound Dance.

Her heart and the zither music had become one at this moment, reaching an unprecedented rapport as if they had known each other for a long time. This strummed her heartstrings as she turned around to look at the blurred figure ten miles away.

“It’s a success!” Mu Xueling’s pupils were filled with joy when she raised her head. When she looked down at Lin Yun again, she had to admit he was really a genius. Not only did he possess a Sovereign Constellation, but he even had such high attainments in music dao.

When Lin Yun was done playing, he briefly pondered about the song he had played earlier before his hands left the zither.

“The Profound Saint Pellets.” Mu Xueling handed a jade bottle over. “You can leave first. I’ll be teaching you the complete Ni Chang Dress Song afterward.”

“Thank you, Saint Elder.” Lin Yun took the jade bottle and didn’t hesitate to leave with his zither. He still wasn’t prepared to meet Yue Weiwei now, and it was fine knowing that she was all right.

Not long after he left, Yue Weiwei descended from the sky and landed beside Mu Xueling. She asked, “Senior Sister, the one playing the zither was Lin Xiao, right?”

“How did you manage to guess it?” Mu Xueling asked.

“It’s just a casual guess. I never thought that it was really him.” Yue Weiwei smiled as she rolled her eyes.

“You want to meet him?” Since it was a success, Mu Xueling felt that it was best for them to meet each other. After all, they would still have to work together for a long time.

“No need. It’s pretty good this way.” Yue Weiwei smiled as she reached for a snowflake in her palm. Looking at the snowflake slowly melting in her palm, she showed a beautiful smile.
