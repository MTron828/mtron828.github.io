Chapter 2012 - Come Down!

After the Blood Crow Ancestor was done speaking, Lil’ Purple said, “Give him another treatment and see if he’s lying this time.”

The Blood Crow Ancestor squinted his eyes and quickly said, “I’ll speak! I’ll speak! I lied earlier! Just don’t come near me…”

But Lin Yun ignored the Blood Crow Ancestor’s pleas for mercy and gave him another ‘treatment.’ After that, the Blood Crow Ancestor finally behaved himself and shared everything he knew about the Udumbara Flower. It turned out that there was a primordial altar within this forest, and the Udumbara Flower was on it. But it was a secret realm; only the Blood Crows knew where it was.

“Kill me,” the Blood Crow Ancestor said, begging to die.

“Big Brother Ye, let me do it.” Bai Qingyu spoke out just when Lin Yun was about to make a move.

When Lin Yun saw the determination within her eyes, he nodded and took a few steps back. Bai Qingyu had changed a lot. She had played along by using herself as bait. If it were in the past, Bai Qingyu would definitely be terrified to the point that she couldn’t even hold her sword. But she did it this time, and she did it beautifully.

Bai Qingyu cut the Blood Crow Ancestor in half with her Stalewater Sword without hesitation, and the Blood Crow Ancestor’s body began to crumble into ashes, leaving behind a golden bead.

When Lin Yun reached for the golden bead, Bai Qingyu fell to the ground, her face pale.

Lil’ Purple asked, “Disciple, what’s wrong with you?”

“Master, I’m fine.” Bai Qingyu was helped back to her feet, and she smiled. She then looked at Lin Yun and asked, “Big Brother Ye, do cultivators really have to kill?”

This was her first time ‘killing’ someone. It was common for her to bully others as the princess of the Bai Clan, but she had never taken another life before.

“We can’t be soft-heated in the path of cultivation. If killings cannot be avoided, let blood and bones forge a path to the peak,” Lin Yun casually said, having passed that phase. He hovered in the air as his sword intent began to burn the surrounding bones, paying homage to the dead.

While looking at the flames and Lin Yun, Bai Qingyu was shocked by this scene. Once the flames grew stronger, the group went out.

“Here, you can have it.” Lin Yun handed the golden bead to Bai Qingyu, and he continued, “I already have one. So you can have this.”

He didn’t allow Bai Qingyu to question him, and his attitude made the latter feel somewhat uncomfortable. But Bai Qingyu still accepted the golden bead with a flushed face. She sneaked a peek at Ye Qingtian and was happy that Ye Qingtian was concerned about her.

But this scene made Lil’ Purple plant her arms at her waist and looked at Lin Yun unhappily.

“Big Brother Ye, are we going to the altar now?” Bai Qingyu asked.

“There’s no need to hurry. I want to refine the bead first and see if I can reach the eighth transformation of the Nirvana Stage. As for you, try to reach the pinnacle eighth transformation of the Nirvana Stage,” Lin Yun said.

“Okay,” Bai Qingyu nodded and looked at Ye Qingtian with reverence. What happened earlier was still a huge blow to her, to kill a Quasi-Saint demonic beast. She didn’t know how she did that. Perhaps it was her trust in Ye Qingtian, or perhaps she had a reason not to lose that enabled her to make the right decision in the critical moment.

In the treehouse inn outside the God Burial Mountain Range, many cultivators were discussing the recent fight of the Divine Blood Flower.

“Six holy lands and hundreds of cultivators, but I didn’t expect the Heavenly Dao Sect to obtain the Divine Blood Flower.”

“The Profound Maiden of the Heavenly Dao Sect is strong enough to block nine Ming Cult experts and the Heavenly Flame Sect by herself. As expected of the Serene Dust Great Saint’s disciple.”

“But Nangong Fuye is the unexpected one. He’s truly worthy of ranking ninth on the King Ranking, seizing the Divine Blood Flower amidst the chaos and charging out.”

“The King Ranking will have to be rearranged after this battle.”

“The Blue Dragon Record will soon appear, and the geniuses on the King Ranking seem much stronger.” The surrounding discussions were focused on the Divine Blood Flower. The Divine Blood Flower was rare, and it could replace the Divine Blood Fruit to a certain extent. It was a treasure that Saints would dream of obtaining.

The top fifty on the King Ranking were practically all drawn over by the Divine Blood Flower, and those who witnessed the battle were shocked.

“Hehe, Senior Brother Nangong, everyone is praising you.” Wang Muyan smiled while sitting at at table on the second floor of the inn while pouring wine for a purple-clothed youth. Aside from them were Xin Yan, Wang Yue, Chen Zhong, and the other Heavenly Dao Sect saint disciples. The nearby seats also had Heavenly Dao Sect saint disciples.

Nangong Fuye, whom everyone was talking about, was a handsome youth, and he was a saint’s disciple of the Heavenly Yin Palace, ranked ninth on the King Ranking.

Xin Yan quietly drank her wine by the side while Chen Zhong and Wang Yue were on the alert. This was because the experts of the five other holy lands were outside the inn.

Nangong Fuye pushed Wang Muyan away and said, “Muyan, there are men from other holy lands here, and it’s inappropriate for us to drink.”

“That’s right. Let’s just wait for the sect’s Saint Elders to come and fetch us,” Wang Yue said. He was cautious, nervous, and uneasy. Seizing the Divine Blood Flower was an important matter, and delivering it back to the sect was another. To a certain degree, delivering it back to the sect was more dangerous.

Wang Yue even suspected that the other holy lands’ saint disciples purposely allowed the Heavenly Dao Sect to seize the Divine Blood Flower.

Wang Muyan smiled, “What do we have to be afraid of with Senior Brother Nangong here? They’re nothing.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Senior Brother, come have a drink!” Wang Muyan leaned over.

This immediately placed Nangong Fuye in a difficult position, and he could only take a drink. Seeing this, Wang Muyan raised her head and poured another cup for him, “Senior Brother is really impressive. Come and have another drink.”

Her voice was bewitching, attracting the gazes of other cultivators. Many demonic cultivators even had lust burning within their pupils.

“That woman is really bewitching. I really want to have some fun with her.”

“Haha, that woman isn’t a person someone like you can provoke. She’s the Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden!”

“She’s the Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden? Her cultivation doesn’t seem impressive… She’s only at the fourth transformation of the Nirvana Stage…” The surrounding cultivators whispered, but their gazes never shifted away from Wang Muyan.

Nangong Fuye’s caution was lowered after drinking wine and hearing Wang Muyan’s flattering. This made him feel a little floated, which made Wang Yue and Chen Zhong shake their heads.

“Profound Maiden Miao Yin, shouldn’t you give Senior Brother Nangong a toast since he saved you?” Wang Muyan turned to look at Xin Yan.

Xin Yan’s face changed, and her pupils flashed with displeasure. Even if Nangong Fuye didn’t help her, she was confident about getting away. So she didn’t need Nangong Fuye to save her at all.

Wang Yue quickly said, “Muyan, this place isn’t safe. So stay low-profiled!”

But Wang Muyan didn’t seem concerned, and she smiled, “Who here doesn’t know that we’ve obtained the Divine Blood Flower? Not to mention Senior Brother Nangong is here with us, so why do we have to be afraid?

“Everyone here is a mere clown, and Senior Brother Nangong can easily squash them to death with a finger.”

Nangong Fuye smiled when he heard that and drank another cup of wine. The surrounding cultivators were unhappy, but they could do nothing about it because Nangong Fuye was ranked ninth on the King Ranking.

“Clowns? Since when have the Heavenly Dao Sect’s disciples been so bloated?” A cold voice resounded. The voice came from the surroundings, and no one could tell who said it.

“Who is it?!” Nangong Fuye roared, putting the cup down.

“Me!” A voice resounded. When everyone turned their heads over, they saw a black-clothed youth looking at the Heavenly Dao Sect’s party.

Upon seeing this person, everyone became nervous, with their faces changed, including the Heavenly Dao Sect’s party.

Nangong Fuye was also shocked, with a hint of fear in his pupils.

“Nangong Fuye, weren't you really cocky earlier? Come down, then. I’m sitting here, so let me see how you’ll kill me!” The black-clothed youth patted his palm on the table. His roar made everyone’s hearts tremble, and they quickly held their chests.

Nangong Fuye’s face also became ugly when he heard what the black-clothed youth said.
