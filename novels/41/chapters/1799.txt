Chapter 1800 - A Form of Inheritance

Lin Yun and Yue Weiwei strolled on the sea, facing the breezy wind under the moonlight. A while later, Yue Weiwei raised her head and smiled, “I can’t imagine that coming from Big Brother Lin.”

As the breeze blew on her long hair, the bashfulness on Yue Weiwei’s face faded a little, and her pupils were filled with tenderness. It was hard for her to imagine Lin Yun saying such words. Perhaps he was being truthful, or perhaps he was lying. But it didn’t matter to her.

Tilting her head, Yue Weiwei said with a mischievous smile, “Big Brother Lin, did anyone call you a scumbag before?”

This question left Lin Yun startled, and he naturally thought of Lil’ Purple. He replied, “Yeah.”

Yue Weiwei widened her eyes, and she couldn’t help laughing. “Big Brother Lin, why are you so adorable? You can deny it.”

“No matter what, I won’t lie to you. As long as you ask, I will answer everything I know.” Lin Yun shook his head.

Yue Weiwei’s heart became soft, and she finally knew why she would be so infatuated with him. Raising her head, Yue Weiwei had heartache in her heart, and she caressed Lin Yun’s face. She asked, “Are you close with her? If you’re not, I won’t allow her to say that or I’ll tear her mouth apart.”

Holding onto Yue Weiwei’s hand, he smiled, “I can’t tell that you’re so domineering.”

“Anyhow, no one is allowed to say anything bad about you.” Yue Weiwei said seriously.

Lin Yun smiled, “She’s an ice phoenix, a little girl who lived for a hundred thousand years. She likes to brag, cry, and throw tantrums. But in times of need, she’s really trustable. The Courting Phoenix was taught to me by her.”

“It’s fine, then.” Yue Weiwei smiled.

The two continued chatting and Lin Yun told her many stories about Lil’ Purple, to which Yue Weiwei listened seriously. Speaking of which, Lil’ Purple was pretty fond of Yue Weiwei and often spoke out for her.

Lin Yun didn’t hide it from Yue Weiwei and told her everything. This further piqued Yue Weiwei’s curiosity, and she said, “I want to meet her, if there’s a chance. Speaking of which, it has been a long time since I last saw the cat.”

“There’s a chance in the future.” Lin Yun said. He also missed Lil’ Purple and Lil’ Red. It had been over a year since they last met, and he had no idea how they were doing at Myriad Demon Peak. He just hoped that they wouldn’t miss their appointment to meet at the Heavenly Dao Sect.

Three days later, when Lin Yun and Yue Weiwei could see Heavenly Domain City from a distance away, they stopped and looked at each other. In the end, Yue Weiwei said, “Let’s part here. Big Brother Lin, you have to be careful. I’ll wait for you in the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion.”

“Okay.” Lin Yun nodded. He was going to find his fellow disciples in Heavenly Domain City, and he had to be cautious because he would be in great trouble if his identity was exposed.

After the Martial Dao Tea Party, Lin Yun’s reputation spread far and wide. There weren’t many people in Heavenly Domain City that didn’t know about his name.

“Wait.” Lin Yun called out to Yue Weiwei just when she was about to leave, and he took out the Thunderstorm Zither. He already made up his mind, and erased his mark on the zither, “I don’t have any relatives in this world, but Big Brother Jiang can be considered one. This belonged to him, so I’d like you to keep it safe for me.”

To Lin Yun, the Thunderstorm Zither was equally as important as the Flower Burial Sword. This was a companion who had been with him for a long time. This was something left behind by Jiang Ling, containing his dying wishes.

“I-I can’t take this…” Yue Weiwei was taken aback.

But Lin Yun seriously said, “Take it. The Divine Indigo Bamboo Flute is a relic from your mother. If you refuse to accept this, I’ll be embarrassed to keep it with me. Besides, I believe you will also treat this zither well, just like how I cherish the flute. If Big Brother Jiang knew that I gave this zither to you, I believe he wouldn’t blame me for it.”

Yue Weiwei looked at Lin Yun. She knew how important this was to him. A long time later, Yue Weiwei finally received the Thunderstorm Zither and said, “I’ll treat it well.”

The Thunderstorm Zither and Divine Indigo Bamboo Flute were like two love tokens being exchanged between them. After Yue Weiwei put away the Thunderstorm Zither, she stepped forth and gave Lin Yun a hug. She then whispered a lot in Lin Yun’s ears before giving him a smile and leaving once she was done.

“I don’t mind…” Lin Yun muttered what Yue Weiwei told him. He watched till Yue Weiwei left before he disguised himself and entered Heavenly Domain City.

Heavenly Domain City was complicated, and it wasn’t hard for him to find the Sword Sect’s residence. After knowing that they were still around, he heaved a sigh of relief. This was because it would be troublesome if they had already left and he had to catch up to them.

He wasn’t in a hurry to head over and decided to wait till nightfall. The Sword Sect stayed on an island in the White Tiger District. Perhaps because they wanted to keep a low profile, the island was pretty remote.

Lin Yun spent some time before he managed to quietly sneak onto the island. This was a courtyard with the outer regions guarded by the Sword Sect’s disciples. Lin Yun used the Divine Phoenix Transformation to swiftly travel across the courtyard and soon found Zhao Yan’s residence. Zhao Yan was a sword fanatic, and he was probably still practicing his sword at this time.

When Lin Yun landed on a roof, he saw a familiar figure practicing the sword at night. She looked heroic, and gave off a faint radiance with her sword ray looking like a white dragon.

This was a sword technique that Lin Yun had never seen before. It didn’t seem like the Sword Sect’s inheritance, and while this made Lin Yun surprised, he also looked relieved.

It looks like the ancient saint origin she obtained at the Ancient Barren Battlefield was a huge fortune for her. Lin Yun inwardly murmured.

It was needless to say this woman was Ye Ziling. When she was done performing her sword technique, Ye Ziling sheathed her sword and looked at the White Dragon Saint Sword in her hand before falling into deep thoughts. The sword was here, but the person that gave him this sword was no longer around.

“Junior Brother Lin, I bet this Martial Dao Tea Party would’ve been even more lively if you’re still around…” Ye Ziling muttered.

Suddenly, she frowned and turned in the direction Lin Yun was in. But when she raised her head, Lin Yun had already disappeared and couldn’t be seen anymore.

Lin Yun sensed her movement beforehand, so he had no choice but to leave, despite wanting to take a few more glances at her. When he left, he couldn’t help feeling conflicted because the Sword Sect still remembered him, even after he had left for a long time.

An hour later, Lin Yun finally found Zhao Yan, who was training with his sword in a separate courtyard. Each of his movements were agile and elegant, causing a great contrast to his dull appearance. His sword was sharper than anyone could imagine.

Just as Zhao Yan pondered over it, he suddenly recalled Lin Xiao’s sword techniques. The more he comprehended, the more it felt profound to him, and this enveloped him in fear.

“How can there be someone so powerful amongst those of the same generation? He doesn’t have any flaws at all…” Zhao Yan sheathed his sword and fell into deep thought. He was a sword fanatic, and he wouldn’t forget any sword technique he saw. He could even find the flaw in Tian Xuanzi’s attacks after pondering for a long time.

So anyone could tell how strong Zhao Yan’s research spirit was. Zhao Yan’s talent might not be the strongest, but his persistence was something that no one could rival. Lin Yun was optimistic about Zhao Yan and knew he would definitely be able to become a Sword Saint in the future.

“Still the same as before.” Lin Yun smiled under his mask. He turned into a streak of light that bolted towards Zhao Yan.

“Who’s there?!” Zhao Yan’s face changed, but what responded to him was a brilliant sword ray. His sword technique was too fast, and Zhao Yan had to bring out his full strength right from the start. He didn’t even have the opportunity to call out to his companions.

Several clashes later, Zhao Yan gradually became puzzled because there was no killing intent coming from this person, and yet this person even gave him a sense of familiarity.

“Heaven Sword Form!” Zhao Yan exclaimed when he saw Lin Yun executing the Carefree 9 Swords, and he also executed the same technique by instinct.

As two ‘Heaven’ words clashed in mid-air, a massive aura swept out. But before Zhao Yan could even think, Lin Yun raised his hand and unleashed another attack of the Carefree 9 Swords. His attacks were slow, containing his insight in it that filled every corner of this courtyard in sword rays.

The Carefree 9 Swords slowly bloomed within Lin Yun’s hands. Like how the Radiant Sword Saint taught him back then, Lin Yun also infused all his insight into his attacks. He swiftly executed the fifth, sixth, and seventh sword forms. When he executed the eighth sword form, boundless killing intent swept out from Lin Yun’s pupils.

This instantly enveloped Zhao Yan’s heart in fear because he could sense himself being surrounded by killing intent. As the sword aura fluctuated in mid-air, Zhao Yan was isolated from the outside world, as if he was trapped in a dark abyss.

Countless figures exploded from Lin Yun with sword rays intertwining, strengthening the cage around him before a bloody ‘Kill’ word appeared. Before his attack even descended, Zhao Yan’s sword aura shattered, making the latter feel like he had taken one step into death.

But Lin Yun didn’t use this sword to attack Zhao Yan. He sheathed his sword at the last moment and pulled his mask down, revealing his face as Lin Xiao, the first on the Nirvana Banquet.

“Lin Yun.” Zhao Yan came to his senses.

“It’s me.” Lin Yun smiled.

Zhao Yan was briefly stunned before he stepped forth and gave Lin Yun a hug. When he let go, he smiled, “If everyone knew that Lin Xiao is Flower Burial, I wonder what they would think.”

“It’s best that no one knows about it.” Lin Yun smiled.

“Yeah.” Zhao Yan smiled. “Senior Brother Lin, come back with us. Everyone misses you a lot. The sect master and peak masters often talk about you.”Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“I want to go back too, but it’s not the time now. My identity still has to be kept a secret.” Lin Yun smiled wryly.

“I know.”

“Do you have any questions about the Carefree 9 Swords? I can guide you tonight.” Lin Yun asked after they sat down.

Zhao Yan also wasn’t polite and asked all the questions he had, including the sword technique Lin Yun performed at the Martial Dao Tea Party. Lin Yun would occasionally nod his head, and their topic basically revolved around swords.

A long time later, Lin Yun uneasily asked, “How’s my master?”

“After you left, Martial Ancestor Radiant was brought back to the Sword Sect by Sword Emperor Yu Qingfeng. He should be fine, but I don’t know the exact details. Martial Ancestor never showed up in public, and there is no news about him, either.” Zhao Yan said honestly.

Lin Yun knew that he owed Yu Qingfeng a lot. He heaved out a breath of relief because no news was good news. But his face soon sank, and he asked, “What about the Profound Sky Sect? Any news about them?”

“None.” Zhao Yan said. “After what happened outside the Ancient Barren Battlefield, the Profound Sky Sect has been laying low, especially Tian Xuanzi. The entire Profound Sky Sect has been restraining themselves a lot, and they practically only operate within their own sphere of influence now. The Ancient Barren Domain has become fairly calm because of it.”

This made Lin Yun furrowed his brows and he became vigilant, wondering what Tian Xuanzi was planning because it was so unlike him to disappear from the public eye.
