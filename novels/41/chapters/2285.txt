Chapter 2286 - Saint Realm

The death of the Ming Cult’s young sect master would cause a huge uproar. But Lin Yun couldn’t be bothered about that since he was someone who decisively settled his grudges. If someone wanted to kill him, he would kill them.RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

He had his hands held in the Flame Dragon Valley and could only put it down for the moment. But since they ran into each other again, Lin Yun had no reason to keep Huang Jingyu around. He wasn’t a reckless person, but one with a clear judgment.

Three Saint Lords were heavily injured and couldn’t bring out much power from their Sovereign Saint Artifacts. So Lin Yun wasn’t afraid even if they wanted to fight him, and he also had the Buddhist Emperor Golden Lotus Spear.

The Indigo Brave Saint Lord was right, Lin Yun came to the Fallen God Valley. He didn’t jump down this time, and he wouldn’t jump down even if the three holy lands caught up with him. Without the Iris Sword Box, he would only die if he jumped down.

There was a violent gale coming from the Fallen God Valley. Lin Yun slowly walked over to the cliff and played the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute.

“Why did the aura here become even more powerful?” Lin Yun frowned. This could only mean that Su Ziyao hadn’t subdued the hand yet, and it was resisting. This instantly made Lin Yun anxious and he wanted to jump down and take a look. But he ultimately held himself back and placed the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute on his lips, playing it. He was playing Courting Phoenix to tell the two below he was fine. Lil’ Purple taught him this song, so she should be able to recognize it.

When his music came over to the island, Su Ziyao was sitting with her eyes closed, while Lil’ Purple was lying on a tree branch with the Iris Sword Box casually beside her. When Lil’ Purple heard the music, she opened her eyes and looked excited. She stood up and said, “Courting Phoenix! The scumbag is here!”

When she jumped down the Divine Mulberry Tree, she heaved a sigh in relief because the fact that Lin Yun was here meant that he was safe and had retrieved the divine flame fragment. But contempt soon appeared as she said, “Why is he playing Courting Phoenix? He can just jump down if he’s missing his wife.”

Su Ziyao opened her eyes and smiled, “You’ll probably be the first to become anxious if he jumps down.”

“Says who? Do you know who I am?” Lil’ Purple said proudly.

Su Ziyao didn’t argue with Lil’ Purple, but said, “The flute music can come down, but my zither music can’t reach him. Do you have a way?”

She looked at Lil’ Purple, hoping the latter could devise a way. But Lil’ Purple didn’t say anything since that question had troubled her.

Seeing this, Su Ziyao smiled, “It looks like there are things that even the Heavenly Slaughter Empress can’t accomplish.”

Lil’ Purple flushed and said, “What’s so difficult? Just watch!”

With a wave, she brought the Iris Sword Box down and began forming seals with her hands. As the floral patterns on the sword box began to change, the two Sovereign Divine Runes within the Iris Secret Realm bloomed before they soared to the sky and shone brightly in the night.

“He should know we’re fine after seeing the light,” Lil’ Purple said smugly.

“The Sovereign Divine Runes are powerful. I wonder what the Iris Sword Box will become when all seven Sovereign Divine Runes are gathered…” Su Ziyao said, looking at the sword box.

“The Iris Secret Realm will be restored once all seven Sovereign Divine Runes have gathered together. The sword box will then become comparable to a holy land. This means that you will be carrying a holy land wherever you go, speeding up your cultivation speed,” Lil’ Purple said. “Back then, this sword box greatly helped the Iris Sword Saint when he was slaying deities and grasped the Nirvana Dao while at the Saint Realm.”

“The sword that’s supposed to be in the sword box as well?” Su Ziyao asked. She was curious about the sword box.

“I don’t know about that. I haven’t seen it before,” Lil’ Purple said. “Su Ziyao, will you go back on your words and not give me the Lunar Divine Rune?”

She thought Su Ziyao didn’t want to give her the Lunar Divine Rune now after asking so many questions.

“You’re overthinking it,” Su Ziyao said, looking at the spatial vortex before her. “Once I subdue this hand, I will return the Lunar Divine Rune to you.”

The two have been here trying to subdue the hand. But they underestimated the power of this hand and failed to subdue it after several attempts. As a result, they could only alter their plans, so Lil’ Purple had to find another way.

“That’s more like it.” Lil’ Purple’s facial expression eased. She asked, “Do you mean what you said before?”

“I have already told you many times that I mean it,” Su Ziyao replied.

When the two radiances shone, Lin Yun lowered the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute. He recognized the radiance that the two Sovereign Divine Runes had released and muttered, “It looks like it hasn’t been smooth for them.”

Since there was a reply, this meant that the two were safe. But the fact that they didn’t come out meant that it wasn’t easy to subdue that hand.

“Let’s wait for a little longer.” Lin Yun hoped Su Ziyao could leave with him, so he waited near the cliff. Since he had nothing better to do, he took out the saint fruits and herbs that were given to him when he was on the Flame Dragon’s skeleton. They were all precious treasures that were rare in the outside world.

“I will need time to consolidate my cultivation after reaching the Saint Realm. I can try to reach it since I have so many saint elixirs,” Lin Yun muttered, looking at the saint elixirs. He could already fight with Saint Lords while being at the Quasi-Saint Realm and suppress them, but it would be troublesome if he faced someone like the Crow Shot Saint Lord. However, things would be different if he could make a breakthrough.

“The Saint Realm…” Lin Yun muttered to himself. Speaking of which, he was only twenty-seven this year, so it was unimaginable to others for him to reach the Saint Realm at this age. But with a grand era’s arrival, it was easier to reach the Saint Realm since the world was slowly changing. Even in the entire Kunlun Realm, it was a big deal if a twenty-seven-year-old Saint Lord appeared. The moment he becomes a Saint, this would spark the beginning of a whole new era.

“I have at least a 70% chance of confidence…” Lin Yun calculated. It wasn’t because he was confident but because his bottleneck had loosened when he suppressed the demonic corpses. If it wasn’t because the Flame Dragon Valley wasn’t safe, he would’ve reached the Saint Realm on the spot. But that was only an opportunity after undergoing a battle, so he could only try another way since he missed it.

“Let’s give it a try. Even 50% is enough for me to take a bet.” Lin Yun made up his mind and sat down by the cliff. To reach the Saint Realm, he must combine his saint soul, sacred flame, and saint constellation to condense his saint origin. At that time, saint energy would be produced within his violet palace. That would then mean that he had successfully become a Saint.

But Lin Yun wasn’t in a hurry. He refined the Qilin Fruit given to him by Qu Wushuang to increase the saint aura within his violet palace. His dragon’s blood began to boil as the effects of the Qilin Fruit far exceeded Lin Yun’s expectations. A few breaths later, Lin Yun felt that he had reached his limit and his entire body began to turn red like boiling magma, with steam rising from him.

Lin Yun realized he was careless because his body had reached a limit after refining an entire saint elixir of this quality. In the next second, a saint radiance shone out of his body. Lin Yun could only spend his time dealing with the violent energy within his body.

Half a day later, the violent energy settled down with his eyes shining brightly. This made him feel heartache since he had wasted one-third of the Qilin Fruit. Now that he was experienced, he began to refine the other saint elixirs and had to strengthen his foundation so that his breakthrough would be smoother. Just like that, three days passed and Lin Yun refined all the saint elixirs without any waste to strengthen his foundation, such as the Thunder Dao, Wind Dao, Sword Dao, the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron, the Heavenly Dragon, the Divine Phoenix, and the three swords…

He pushed them to the limit before becoming a Saint. As for his cultivation, his saint aura had been tempered ten-odd times until the saint elixirs couldn’t further strengthen his saint aura.

On the fourth day, Lin Yun’s bottleneck shattered as his sacred flame, saint soul, and saint constellation began to fuse. Everything was so smooth that it surprised Lin Yun because he had condensed his saint origin in just half a day. When the saint origin was formed, Lin Yun gave off a dazzling radiance with a pillar of light spreading out.

The spiritual energy in the surroundings began pouring into the saint origin within Lin Yun’s body. His violet palace was slowly being filled with saint energy, converting his saint aura. Lin Yun was excited as an endless flow of saint energy filled his body. But he continued to devour the spiritual energy in the surroundings to the point that even he couldn’t control it. His saint origin soon stabilized, giving off a golden radiance.

“I-I’ve almost reached the pinnacle of the first-stage Saint Lord?” Lin Yun was surprised that he nearly made a breakthrough to the second-stage Saint Lord. He quickly focused since making another breakthrough before his saint origin had stabilized would shake his foundation.

He did his best to control the violent energy within his body and forged his saint origin into the shape of an Iris Flower. The Iris Flower was golden, looking like it was forged with metal. The saint origin had just been formed and hadn’t been stabilized, so he could shape it with his sword intent.

Lin Yun was confident in this step since the saint origin was his foundation as a Saint, and he couldn’t be careless with it.
