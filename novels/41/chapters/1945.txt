Chapter 1946 - Bai Shuying (2)

“You’re not allowed to do anything to it. I’ll teach you the Heavenly Silkworm Hands. There are still dozens of varieties you’ve not learned yet,” Lil’ Purple said before she dragged Lin Yun aside. She only felt relieved after Lin Yun was far from the Phoenix Tree.

“Let’s begin!” Lil’ Purple placed her hands up and down with her thumbs connected. Her left palm was facing her while her right palm was facing out. She grinned as she began to change her hand signs. Her movements were slow, but her hands began to leave behind images like a flower closing up.

The movements of her hands became dazzling, and he was having a tough time catching up. But Lil’ Purple smiled, and Lin Yun was shocked to discover that the saint runes on his robe were being removed like silk threads.

“This is magical.” Lin Yun praised, then he said, “But my robe is ruined, now…”

“Hehe. This is nothing. I can sew them back for you.” Lil’ Purple’s hands changed again, and the saint runes returned to Lin Yun’s robe.

Witnessing this, Lin Yun was breath-taken, and he praised, “Impressive…”

He suddenly thought of something and smiled, “So this is the Heavenly Silkworm Hands. Not only can it dissolve saint diagrams, but it can even strip someone nude.”

But surprisingly, Lil’ Purple wasn’t furious and smiled, “Someone really did that in the past.”

“Isn’t this your masterpiece? Why did you let it spread around?” Lin Yun asked.

“I have a lot of creations, and this is nothing.” Lil’ Purple said in disdain.

Well, Lil’ Purple was the one who received a beating from Bai Shuying.

Lin Yun smiled, but didn’t openly expose her. He began to get familiar with the Heavenly Silkworm Hands. He was smart, and his mental energy wasn’t weak. He had Lil’ Purple, the creator of the Heavenly Silkworm Hands, teaching him.

So he naturally learned it quickly. He might not be able to catch up with Bai Shuying, but he grasped more varieties than her.

“Someone’s here.” While the two were excitedly cultivating, Lin Yun suddenly sensed someone coming, and said, “Chen Feng is here. I’ll go out first.”

“Go on, go on.” Lil’ Purple said, quickly urging Lin Yun to leave.

Lin Yun merely smiled because he could tell Lil’ Purple was afraid that he would make a move against the Phoenix Tree. After he left the Iris Secret Realm, he saw Chen Feng excitedly running over.

“Senior Brother, something happened!” Chen Feng yelled with a rosy face.

When Lin Yun saw this, he couldn’t help smiling and asked, “What can possibly happen within the Heavenly Dao Sect?”

“It really is a huge matter!” Chen Feng took a deep breath and said in a grave tone, “The Nether Orchid Holy Maiden is personally here outside the courtyard. But she’s afraid she might disrupt your cultivation, so she had me look for you.”

When hearing that, Lin Yun’s face slightly changed, and he wondered what she was doing here.

But Chen Feng was excited, while Lin Yun was more composed. She knew that Bai Shuying wouldn’t be here for no reason. So could it be because of what happened before?

Lin Yun couldn’t help suspecting with his brows furrowed. He didn’t want to see Bai Shuying right now. After all, there was a misunderstanding between them, not to mention she left in a fury half a month ago.

It wouldn't be simple since she came to Indigo Thunder Peak, even at the expense of breaking her oath. So Lin Yun recollected himself and said in a decisive tone, “You tell her I’m not around.”

“What?” Chen Feng was dumbfounded on the spot.

The entire Indigo Thunder Peak went into an uproar at the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden’s arrival, and outside was filled with disciples. They were all shocked by Bai Shuying’s charm.

This was a glory because the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden had a lot of pursuers within the Heavenly Dao Sect. It was so much so that she even had pursuers outside the sect, but she never paid any attention to them.

So if the news that Bai Shuying personally came to Indigo Thunder Peak and was waiting outside Ye Qingtian’s courtyard spread out, god knows how many people would die of jealousy.

But Ye Qingtian did not react, and he wasn’t even willing to see her. So wasn’t this a little too cocky? Even Chen Feng never expected Ye Qingtian to reject the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden.

But he soon thought of something. After all, the relationship between his senior brother and Wang Muyan was complicated, and he probably wanted to avoid arousing suspicion if he met Bai Shuying.

Chen Feng instantly comprehended it and looked at Ye Qingtian with reverence filling his pupils. Ye Qingtian was playing with the two holy maidens in his palm.

The Nether Orchid Holy Maiden ultimately couldn’t win against his senior brother’s means, but that wasn’t all because his senior brother still wasn’t going to meet Bai Shuying. This was the same as hanging Bai Shuying in suspense.

This instantly made Ye Qingtian his idol, and Chen Feng smiled before he cupped his hands together, “I understand. This is really an excellent move by Senior Brother. You’re our role model, and I’ll tell her immediately.”

“What?” Lin Yun was surprised this time because he had no idea what Chen Feng was talking about. When he saw Chen Feng leaving in excitement, he was dumbfounded because he just wanted to avoid Bai Shuying, and this made him wonder what was going on within Chen Feng’s mind.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Holy Maiden… this…” But before he could think about that, Chen Feng nervously returned.

When Lin Yun placed the teacup down, he saw Bai Shuying entering his courtyard.

“Senior Brother… I said nothing…” Chen Feng lowered his head and quickly fled. Bai Shuying was already waiting outside, and she heard their conversation.

“Ye Qingtian, you’re really shameless! Am I that terrifying?” Bai Shuying glared at Lin Yun.

This instantly placed Lin Yun in an awkward position, and he didn’t know how to respond.

Bai Shuying sat down and placed her sword to the side before she mocked, “Aren’t you proficient in reciting poems? What poem should you recite at this moment? Go on, I’m all ears.”

Lin Yun didn’t want to argue with her and lowered himself, “They’re just pearls of wisdom left behind by the ancestors.”

Bai Shuying was just casually talking about it, and she became serious after listening to Ye Qingtian’s explanation. Bai Shuying had checked all the poems Ye Qingtian recited, but there weren’t any clues about them.

“You have no choice but to recite one today. No one has ever dared to lie to me so blatantly.” Bai Shuying’s mood naturally became foul after hearing that Ye Qingtian wanted to pretend not to be around.

She initially didn’t want to come in, but she became furious after hearing what Ye Qingtian said. Since Ye Qingtian didn’t want to meet her, she insisted on coming in. How could she let Ye Qingtian off so easily?
