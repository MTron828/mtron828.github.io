Chapter 373 - Yin-Yang Pellet

The Indigo Thunderfiend Dracoape’s beast core flickered with lightning and the demonic miasma shrouding the black lotus was filled with bloodlust and violence. Vaguely, Lin Yun could even see a faint demonic dragon’s image. It was probably the ancient demon dragon’s bloodline that belonged to the Indigo Thunderfiend Dracoape.

The beast core was enveloped with spiritual energy along with demonic miasma that reeked of violence and brutality. This was why it was extremely compatible with the Dracophant Battle Physique. Lin Yun didn’t regret offending Mu Xiuhan for this beast core.

Closing his eyes, Lin Yun circulated the dracophant energy to refine the beast core. The beast core’s energy shuttled through his body like bolts of lightning, which put him under great pressure. But this was a treasure for cultivators of the Dracophant Battle Physique.

This violent energy was necessary for cultivators of the Dracophant Battle Physique. Even if the bolts of lightning were violent, the dracophant energy would absorb them completely.

As time slowly passed, dracophant energy started emitting from Lin Yun’s body. At the same time, his aura began to violently rise. His clothes fluttered like a war flag under the energy fluctuation and his facial features slowly became even more defined.

When he was done refining the beast core, his aura reached a new pinnacle. Lightning flickered in the purple mist that shrouded him.

Lin Yun slowly opened his eyes and a hint of ferocity flashed through his pupils. His eyes were filled with pressure like an ancient beast. However, he was still one step away from the fifth stage of the Dracophant Battle Physique. But he wasn’t worried because he still had the Dao Insight Diagram.

Lin Yun unrolled the painting and he found himself in a barren land facing an ancient dracophant. A dracophant roar echoed throughout the barren land as the dracophant ferociously charged. It crushed countless beasts with its foot and seemed like it would shake the mountains whenever it moved.

Strangely, the dracophant was moving quietly when it did this. The aura that the dracophant was emitting was suffocating. When it stopped charging, it felt like time stopped. Lin Yun couldn’t imagine the strength of the dracophant that could even stop time. Lin Yun fell into deep thought before six words appeared in his mind ‘lifting heavy as if it's light!’

This was the true profundity behind the Dracophant Battle Physique. When one’s strength reached the pinnacle, one could step on heaven and earth with one’s foot. It might seem like a light step, but the ground was suppressed so that it couldn’t shake.

Lin Yun had no idea how far he was from that level. But he was satisfied that he could comprehend something from the painting.

Lin Yun shut his eyes to sense the profundity in the painting while the outline of a dracophant war cauldron appeared in his mind. Rather than refining the dracophant energy, Lin Yun decided to walk on a whole new different path from the Primal Origin Sect.

The painting hovering in the air also started to ignite. By the time Lin Yun reopened his eyes, the painting was already reduced to ashes.

Standing up on his feet, Lin Yun punched the secret chamber’s wall. His punch produced five echoes of saintly music that sounded like an ancient war song, echoing throughout the chamber. At the same time, fine cracks started to spread out around the chamber.

When Lin Yun’s foot landed on the ground, he landed silently like a feather.

His strength had reached five cauldron’s worth of strength, but Lin Yun felt that this wasn’t his limit. Lin Yun fell into deep thought before he circulated the dracophant energy within his body. Accompanied by lightning crackles, Lin Yun threw another punch out. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

This time, the wall before him collapsed entirely and broke down into pieces. The Black Lotus Palace’s wall couldn’t even take one of his punches, which showed how powerful Lin Yun had gotten.

“I should be able to reach sixth cauldron’s worth of strength at my full strength. But I’ve just reached the fifth stage, so I can continue to uncover more potential of the Dracophant Battle Physique later.” Lin Yun let out a breath and slowly regained his composure. The sword was ultimately still his main focus.

“I should be able to hold my ground against cultivators in the tenth stage now. I might even have a chance at winning if my opponent doesn’t know my trump card, but my odds aren't high. I have to reach the tenth level, there’s no other choice. I really need to advance my Iris Sword Sutra.” The gap between each stage of the late phase of the Profound Martial Realm would become wider and wider.

He might be able to hold his ground against enemies in the ninth stage by relying on the Iris Sword Sutra, but the pressure would be great if he encountered someone in the tenth stage. Then again, it wouldn’t be easy for cultivators in the tenth stage to defeat him either.

Lin Yun decided it was time to go and continued forward. He arrived at the sixth level’s Lotus Treasure Stage and saw that the treasure had already been taken. This meant that someone was here not too long ago, but he wasn’t surprised. After all, he wasted quite a bit of time with the Dracophant Battle Physique, so this was to be expected.

Stepping on the Lotus Treasure Stage, Lin Yun ascended to the seventh level. The seventh level’s test was to face and survive ten attacks from the white-clothed man.

The white-clothed man would reveal a flaw on purpose in his test. So it wasn’t difficult as long as the participants were attentive enough. Then again, that was only the case for someone at Lin Yun’s level.

Meanwhile, other participants had made it through the test.

“Hehe, it’s good that I managed to obtain a harvest in the sixth level. Otherwise, I might not have been able to get through this test.” The Hundred Beast Gate’s Feng Ye grinned when he stepped into the passage.

His strength had improved greatly and he was only half a step away from reaching the tenth stage of the Profound Martial Realm. His steps were heavy and he would leave a footprint behind with every step.

This showed his powerful strength as well as his lack of proficiency to control his strength after making a breakthrough.

Looking at the scene before him, the Sevendespair Palace’s Jing Jue muttered to himself coldly, “I’ve finally reached the eighth level. Now, I can finally hold some expectation for the last three treasures.”

The eighth level had two stages, while the ninth level only had one. This meant that there were three treasures. There was no doubt that the treasures were priceless. In fact, they were so famous that they were known as Black Lotus Treasures. Only by obtaining one of them could someone be considered the biggest winner of the Black Lotus Palace.

Jing Jue only hoped for a cosmic artifact. Specifically, he wanted a saber that fit him well. Additionally, the Demonflame Sect’s Bai Yue, Heavenly Profound Sect’s Tang Yuan, and Demonic Moon Villa’s Shui Wuhen were also on the eighth level.

If Lin Yun was included among them, then only six people were left. Everyone outside the Extermination Barrens was paying close attention to how things would go. After all, their results represented glory and Black Lotus Treasures.

When Lin Yun was walking in the passage, he was certain that he had caught up to everyone else. There were also some who were left behind by him. Those in the seventh and sixth levels would have nothing if they were slow.

Right at this moment, a familiar fluctuation came from in front of him. It was the Lotus Treasure Stage’s aura. While Lin Yun was searching through the hall, a bright light caught his attention.

“Don’t tell me that we can’t even see the treasure itself?” sighed Lin Yun. He no longer dared to be careless in the eighth level. Those who could make it this far had proven their strength.

When the Lotus Treasure Stage’s aura slowly became clearer, Lin Yun soon found himself in a majestic hall. The Lotus Treasure Stage was emitting a faint glow, which was the sign of an emerging treasure.

When the radiance disappeared, a pellet appeared on the Lotus Treasure Stage. The pellet had golden and silver runes, which formed two dragon runes that coiled around the pellet. The aura of the two dragons were completely opposite from each other, which represented Yin and Yang. Under the dragon images, the medicinal energy coming from the pellet had reached a state of balance. At the very least, this should be a fourth grade spiritual pellet.

Lin Yun’s heart jolted. He was barely in the eighth stage of the Profound Martial Realm, so it would be great if he could use this pellet to reach the pinnacle eighth stage.

“The Yin-Yang Pellet?” Another figure appeared from another passage, also looking at the pellet on the Lotus Treasure Stage.
