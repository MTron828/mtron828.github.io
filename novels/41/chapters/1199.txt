Chapter 1200 - Azure Dragon Sword Array

The dense stench of blood was striking, especially with corpses covering the plaza. As everyone recovered from the music, they were shocked to see a hellish scene in front of them.

“This…” Zhao Yan didn’t know what to say when he recovered.

As for the rest of the crowd, they couldn’t believe what they were seeing. Their eyes nearly fell out of their sockets from disbelief.

Like Lin Yun, there were many people that completed the first round. However, no one ever got through the first round as easily as Lin Yun had. In fact, no one had ever killed a hundred swordsmen with just one sword.

The aftermath of the slaughter was a huge blow to the Azure Rock Hidden Sword Pavilion. After all, it took a lot of time and resources to nurture a hundred swordsmen. In the future, the Feng Clan wouldn’t be able to operate the Hundred Ghost Sword Array on their own. So the Hidden Sword Pavilion would be closed for a long time.

Feng Xuanzi threw up a mouthful of blood as soon as he saw the scene.

“Big Brother!” The other elders’ faces changed when they saw that Feng Xuanzi was about to collapse. They quickly stepped forward to support him. Feng Xuanzi’s face was terrifyingly pale and haggard now, which made the other elders of the Feng Clan turn pale.

“This bastard! I have to kill him no matter what!” The Feng Clan’s Grand Elder had rage written on his face when he looked at Lin Yun.

“Come back!” Feng Xuanzi gave the Grand Elder a command that he couldn’t disobey. As for the representatives from the other clans, they weren’t sure what to do. The only thing that they could think about was how this never happened before.

Even if someone managed to get through the first round, they would still give face to the Hidden Sword Pavilion. Lin Yun was the only person ruthless enough to kill every single swordsman. It really seemed like the Feng Clan was doomed.

“Lin Yun, you’re really ruthless!” Feng Xuanzi gnashed his teeth while looking at Lin Yun.

“I’m ruthless?” Lin Yun sneered inwardly because he had never seen someone so unreasonable. The Hundred Ghost Sword Array was ruthless. Plus, the swordsmen came at him with the intent to kill him. So how could Feng Xuanzi call Lin Yun ruthless?

Lin Yun couldn’t even draw his sword to deal with the swordsmen. So why was he called ruthless when he simply used his other means?

“Whatever,” said Lin Yun before he turned his head away. He clearly had no interest in arguing with Feng Xuanzi.

The Feng Clan’s elders were furious at Lin Yun’s attitude. They couldn’t believe that Lin Yun was so arrogant that he would ignore Feng Xuanzi. Feng Xuanzi was also deeply angered, but he managed to calm himself down. “Lin Yun, I’ll give you a chance now. Stop this nonsense and I’ll pretend like nothing happened.”

“Big Brother!” The Feng Clan’s Grand Elder became anxious when he heard that. After all, how could they let Lin Yun go after suffering such a huge loss?

“Shut it!” Feng Xuanzi glared at the Grand Elder before he continued, “I can even give you a thousand rune saint sword to compensate for your loss of the Incineration Sword.”

His words were like a huge bomb that caught everyone by surprise. Who would have thought that the Feng Clan would extend an olive branch? Not only were they going to let Lin Yun off, but they would give him a new sword.

“Holy shit, this is too shocking!” Ye Feifan was completely shocked by Feng Xuanzi’s words and his heart began to throb violently. Did Lin Yun scare the entire Feng Clan with his sword? It was like Feng Xuanzi was begging Lin Yun to give up.

The crowd broke into an uproar because it seemed like Lin Yun had a chance to defeat the array. Even if Lin Yun only had 1% chance of succeeding, it seemed like the Feng Clan wasn’t willing to risk it.

The Feng Clan already suffered an immense loss, so they probably wanted to protect the Lightning Shadow Sword. If they lost that too, they would never recover.

Gongsun Yan looked at Lin Yun with deep jealousy in his eyes. After all, not every single disciple from the Sword Emperor’s lineage had a thousand rune saint sword. Furthermore, the sword promised by Feng Xuanzi would at least have a ninth-grade saint rune. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Many people stared at Lin Yun with conflicted gazes. Suddenly, Gong Haoran spoke up, “There’s no way he will refuse. Everyone that has challenged the arrays were left for dead. Plus, Lin Yun has already accomplished his goal and embarrassed the Feng Clan. It looks like he will walk away with a decent thousand rune saint sword.”

“Sorry, but I refuse.” The suggestion was tempting, but Lin Yun didn’t even consider the offer. Zhao Yan covered his mouth and held back his laughter. At this moment, Zhao Yan knew that Lin Yun was a genuine swordsman. No genuine swordsman would give into temptation when they had a clear objective.

After getting smacked so quickly, Gong Haoran’s expression became awkward. “I don’t believe that he can make it through the second round!”

“Lin Yun, don’t push it!” The Grand Elder of the Feng Clan also felt a burning pain on his cheek because Feng Xuanzi humbled himself to give Lin Yun face. Feng Xuanzi didn’t even have to give a saint any respect, so how could the Grand Elder stand to see Lin Yun disrespect Feng Xuanzi?

Feng Xuanzi’s face was ugly when he heard Lin Yun’s reply and said, “Second round, the Azure Dragon Sword Array!”

When a dragon roar echoed out in the horizon, a dragon broke through the clouds and unleashed a dazzling sword ray. At this moment, the sword aura and dragon aura combined to form the Azure Dragon Sword Aura. Shortly after, the Azure Dragon dove down.

But just when the azure dragon was about to descend, the azure dragon exploded into swords that rained down from the sky. Countless swords plunged into the grounds while releasing a loud hum. A total of 343 swords pierced the ground in the outline of the Azure Dragon Constellation.

Each sword represented a star, and the Azure Dragon Sword Array represented the Azure Dragon Constellation. Shortly after, 300 people flew over and stood on the swords. Leading the group was a middle-aged man in his fifties. Clearly, his sky sword intent was at an extremely high level.

“The Azure Dragon Sword Array!” Many people held their breaths when they saw how strong the sword array was. Simply put, anyone who challenged the array would lose their life.

It had been a long time since the geniuses of the Azure Rock County City saw the Azure Dragon Sword Array. But they never expected that an outsider from the Profound Azure Prefecture would force Feng Xuanzi this far. No one had survived the Azure Dragon Sword Array, so it looked like Lin Yun was finished.

“Kill him!” Feng Xuanzi said coldly while grinding his teeth. The Azure Dragon came to life and charged toward Lin Yun with a ferocious roar.

The entire heaven and earth were trembling as countless sword rays formed a gigantic dragon. From afar, it looked like a real Azure Dragon was in front of the now tiny Lin Yun.

As the Azure Dragon emitted a dazzling radiance, the pressure forced Lin Yun to take several steps back. Although the people who stood on the swords were restricting their cultivation to the Heavenly Soul Realm, they were strong together. So Lin Yun’s quasi-divine firmament sword intent didn’t stand a chance.

“Azure Dragon Tail Whip!” The middle-aged man roared. The azure dragon’s tail emitted a flash of dazzling lightning before it swept over. A powerful gale swept out with the tail and left cracks in space.

But Lin Yun managed to dodge the attack and destroyed the gale with his sword. But in the next second, the azure dragon turned around and charged at Lin Yun again. “Azure Dragon’s Dance!”

When the Azure Dragon opened its mouth, Lin Yun couldn’t dodge. So he brandished his sword to block the attack head-on. Although the azure dragon collided with Lin Yun’s sword, it was actually the clash between Lin Yun’s sword and the middle-aged man’s sword. As for the other swordsmen, they were all emitting sword auras to empower the Azure Dragon Sword Array.

Under the huge collision, Lin Yun’s feet sank into the ground. At this moment, Lin Yun was surrounded by stones that were hovering in the air.

“He’s still too tender…” Zhao Yan wore a grave expression because the Azure Dragon Sword Array was simply too unreasonable. It had 300 people working together who had worked together for over a decade. If an empyrean couldn’t find a flaw in this array, how could a Heavenly Soul Realm?

In the end, the only choice was to destroy the array by brute force. But everyone had to restrict their cultivation in the Heavenly Soul Realm, so it was an impossible task.
