Chapter 1309 - Serene Night

Lin Yun’s body was already on the verge of collapse after creating his own Sovereign Constellation. But when his Sovereign Constellation entered his body, his injuries were recovering at a rapid speed, and he also began to emit flashes of dazzling brilliance.

Standing on the summit of the mountain, Lin Yun was like a bright sun with astral energy filling up every single corner of his body, filling him with boundless vitality. This improvement was quick and unbelievable.

Under the dazzling light, Lin Yun’s body was like a huge, blazing cauldron, enveloped in a golden brilliance. At this moment, his cultivation was rising at a rapid speed, reaching the Lesser Astral Stage in the blink of an eye. Suddenly, an explosion resounded from within his body, and his aura in the Astral Stage was boosted once more.

“Greater Astral Stage!” Lil’ Purple was surprised by this scene because this was simply too shocking. She had never heard of anyone reaching the Greater Astral Stage upon entering the Astral Stage. But that wasn’t all, Lin Yun’s aura continued to rise.

Then again, it wasn't surprising because Lin Yun had previously refined the Saint Dragon Blood Fruit, and he also exhausted five million Divine Astral Pellets to create his own Sovereign Constellation. This gave him a terrifying foundation, and now that he had created his own constellation, his physique was greedily devouring the surrounding spiritual energy.

Under the bright light, Lin Yun’s Sovereign Constellation was faintly appearing, and the eight ominous souls could be seen together. As they breathed astral energy, they were slowly becoming vivid.

Suddenly, a sword ray appeared above the eight ominous souls, along with the appearance of a cosmos. As light flowed between the eight ominous souls and the divine sword, they seemed to be nourishing each other at this moment.

The eight ominous souls were empowering the divine sword, while the divine sword controlled the eight ominous souls. This gave off the feeling that the entire cosmos would be destroyed if the divine sword made a move.

“Heaven Burial!” Lil’ Purple muttered with deep shock in her eyes. Even now, she still couldn’t believe that Lin Yun had created his own Sovereign Constellation, creating his own invincible painting. This meant that Lin Yun had opened his own path under the pressure of a hundred Sovereign Constellations, and this was simply too shocking.

But why did so many geniuses in the Golden Era fail while Lin Yun succeeded? This was something that Lil’ Purple couldn’t figure out. In terms of talent, there were unrivaled geniuses in the Golden Era that weren’t any weaker than Lin Yun. They were so much so that there were even geniuses stronger than him.

She had seen countless heaven-defying geniuses who were practically invincible. In terms of talent in the sword, the Iris Sword Saint was naturally stronger than Lin Yun. After all, the Iris Sword Saint could slay deities while he was only at the Saint Realm, and he was a legend among legends in the Golden Era.

He was so mysterious and terrifying that even deities had to lower their heads before him. But the Iris Sword Saint wasn’t able to create his own Sovereign Constellation. It didn’t matter if he wanted or not, but the Iris Sword Saint didn’t choose to try and create his own Sovereign Constellation. Instead, he had chosen to succeed the Heaven Subduing Constellation.

“Is it because of that sword?” Lil’ Purple muttered with curiosity filling her pupils, making her look adorable. Shortly after, a smile appeared on her face. She gave up trying to figure it out. It didn’t matter if his path ahead would be difficult; since he had survived, he has shown the potential of reaching the peak of the Kunlun Realm.

“Hmph, you made this empress worry about you!” Lil’ Purple pouted unhappily. When Lin Yun wakes up, she definitely had to teach him a lesson, but when she thought about it, it didn’t seem possible since she never succeeded every time before. Not only did she fail, but she even embarrassed herself even more.

Thinking about it made Lil’ Purple puff up her cheeks and started grinding her teeth. Right at that moment, the shattering of spiritual runes resounded with an ancient aura slowly invading it. This instantly made Lil’ Purple’s face change and turn cold because the spiritual array she had set up was being destroyed!

“You’re courting death, no matter who you are!” Lil’ Purple’s eyes flashed with a killing aura. Lin Yun was in a critical moment right now, so if someone disrupted him at this moment, not only would all of his efforts go down the drain, even his Sovereign Constellation would suffer huge damage. Judging from the speed of Lin Yun’s improvement right now, it wouldn’t be surprising if his cultivation managed to reach the Quasi-Elysium Core Realm. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Lil’ Red!” Lil’ Purple yelled while she stood on the Snow Heed Blade, before heading to the edge of the spiritual array.

Lil’ Red quickly followed behind Lil’ Purple. Outside the array, there was a grey-clothed old man. He was old and only at the Lesser Elysium Core Realm, but the aura that he gave off was comparable to a Greater Elysium Core Realm. He was enveloped in a boundless black light.

His face was stiff and looked like a dead person’s, but the boundless vitality that he was giving off was terrifying. This scene made Lil’ Purple lock her brows together because there was a huge gap between the Lesser and Greater Elysium Core Realms.

Lin Yun could easily deal with those at the Lesser Elysium Core Realm, but he had to resort to using the Lightning Shadow Sword to face Greater Elysium Core Realm experts. Then again, that was before he reached the Astral Stage.

The grey-clothed elder was clearly at the Lesser Elysium Core Realm, but the aura he gave off was comparable to the Greater Elysium Core Realm, and this was a little terrifying. When the grey-clothed elder stood in mid-air, he was like a ferocious beast that blatantly ignored Lil’ Purple. When he looked through the barrier, his eyes were fixed on Lin Yun’s direction.

This made Lil’ Purple baffled and wonder how this person knew that Lin Yun was here. Suddenly, the grey-clothed old man raised his hand. As astral light surged, the surrounding sky became dark and flames converged before slamming against the barrier.

But that wasn’t all. A green light also began to converge in his palm before a gigantic, hundred-foot green palm came pressing down. In the path of the green palm, space began to crack and unleashed a destructive prowess that looked like the arrival of the apocalypse.

This scene made Lil’ Purple’s face change and she wondered where this monster came from. If she really allowed the grey-clothed old man’s attack to reach the barrier, the array that she had set up would be instantly destroyed.

Right at that moment, a ferocious roar echoed with Lil’ Red taking the form of an Ancient Dracoape before charging at the grey-clothed old man. When it brandished its staff, the sky began to change and the runes engraved on the staff began to light up. The space around the staff began to distort as it collided with the gigantic palm, leaving fine cracks on the green flaming palm.

The dracoape had rage flashing through its pupils as it brandished the staff once more. Repeating the strike three times, the gigantic green palm finally shattered into pieces.

“A Dracoape?” The grey-clothed old man said, but in a woman's voice.

This made Lil’ Purple surprised because she initially thought that this grey-clothed old man had been turned into a Demonic Corpse by a demonic aura. But that was clearly not the case, and there was clearly something wrong with this grey-clothed old man.

“Watch out!” Lil’ Purple’s face changed upon sensing the danger.

Before Lil’ Red could respond in time, the grey-clothed old man instantly approached it with a few flickers. As the grey-clothed old man emitted a bizarre fragrance, it made Lil’ Purple confused. But before it could wake up, the grey-clothed old man clapped its hands together and a green light landed on the head of the dracoape.

This made Lil’ Red release a miserable shriek as its vitality was being swiftly devoured by the grey-clothed old man at a visible speed.

Watching this scene, Lil’ Purple wore a grave expression before she soared into the sky on the Snow Heed Blade. Her hair had turned silver, and she began to emit an ancient yet sacred aura. At the same time, the clouds behind her had formed into a pair of phoenix wings.

When Lil’ Purple began to form seals, one silver shackle after another began to appear before shooting at the grey-clothed old man. The grey-clothed old man was forced to release Lil’ Red before gently flicking towards those shackles, easily destroying them.

Then, the grey-clothed old man’s gaze fell onto Lil’ Purple, and said once more, “A phoenix?”

When he was done, he seemed to have gone insane with green flames blazing on him while he pounced at Lil’ Purple. All the shackles that stood in his way instantly crumbled, and he had appeared before her in the blink of an eye.

Letting out a grin, the grey-clothed old man began to swell in size before reaching for Lil’ Purple’s head. Under his palm, everything seemed to be restrained, and even the air had stopped flowing.

“Dragon Locking Prison!” But Lil’ Purple didn’t panic and tapped her fingers. As a cold light began to shine from the broken shackles, they began to converge together and formed a crystal cage and trapped the grey-clothed old man within it. When the grey-clothed old man’s hand stretched out of the cage, his hand was completely frozen in ice.

But before Lil’ Purple could catch her breath, a terrifying dark light was emitted from the grey-clothed old man, and all of heaven began to tremble. The demonic light immediately tore apart the first layer of heaven, destroying the cage along with it.

“H-How is this possible?!” Lil’ Purple squinted her pupils with fear flashing across her pupils. This was too terrifying because this grey-clothed old man was even stronger than ordinary Greater Elysium Core Realm experts.

“Phoenix!” A woman's voice resounded from the grey-clothed old man once more as he reached out to grab Lil’ Purple. But right at that moment, a sword ray flew out and hit the grey-clothed old man. At the same time, an azure-clothed figure flew over.

“Let’s go!” Grabbing onto Lil’ Purple, Lin Yun flew towards the sky.

Just when the two left, cracks began to appear on the grey-clothed old man before he exploded, causing the surroundings to tremble from the surging, destructive aura.

When Lin Yun squinted his eyes at the cloud of dust, he saw a blurred green outline. This made him surprised because he recognized it. At the same time, he didn’t think that it would follow him here. “The Serene Night?”
