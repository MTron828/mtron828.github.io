Chapter 1566 - Turning Back

When Lin Yun executed the Profound Sword Form, Huang Xuanyi’s attack that could kill any Elysium Core Realm genius was returned to him.

This scene made Huang Xuanyi cuss out loud, but he couldn’t afford to be distracted, since he knew how terrifying the Divine Sun Moon Altar was. He would be heavily injured on the spot if he took it head-on.

He swiftly began to form seals, but he was ultimately one step slower and was sent flying away. When he was sent flying away, he finally finished forming his seal. Seeing the Divine Sun Moon Altar flying at him again, Huang Xuanyi roared before he pushed his hands forth, “Lightless Sun Moon!”

The Divine Sun Moon Altar then shattered, returning to its sun and moon form hovering around Huang Xuanyi. But this also made Huang Xuanyi’s face pale and he threw out a mouthful of blood because the circulation of his astral energy had exceeded the limit of his physique. The Divine Sun Moon Altar wasn’t something that he could take head-on.

“Die!” Huang Xuanyi raised his hand. The sun and moon merged to form a ‘Ming’ word again. But it was different this time The word flickered with crimson light and looked more solidified. It was the Light Destruction Divine Array again, and the crimson word briefly hovered before falling towards Lin Yun.

Lin Yun raised his head and quickly made a decision. He knew that the ‘Ming’ word this time was different, and he couldn’t destroy it with the Azure Dragon Grasp.

The other sects’ disciples were nervously holding their breaths because an outcome could be determined at any moment, and even they were unsure who would be the last man standing. This was something that no one had imagined. After all, Huang Xuanyi was ranked first on the Elysium Core Ranking, an existence that could sweep through all the Elysium Core Realm geniuses. He was known to be invincible amongst the same generation.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

So no one expected his fight with Lin Yun to be so intense, not to mention that Lin Yun even held a slight advantage in the battle against him.

“Hahaha! Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple, use whatever means you have! Where’s the Azure Dragon Grasp that you used earlier?!” Huang Xuanyi’s facial expression was somewhat hideous when he said that.

Just when everyone felt that Lin Yun would use the Azure Dragon Grasp to resolve this attack again, Lin Yun suddenly raised his sword before him and placed two fingers on it. As he closed his eyes, he began to circulate the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra within his body.

Circulating the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra, the Netherflower within his violet palace radiated brightly and a black miasma poured out from his body. He was still holding onto the Flower Burial Sword, allowing the crimson ‘Ming’ to descend without moving.

“What’s going on? He’s no longer using his secret technique, but the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra?”

“Strange. Isn’t the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra a mediocre technique in the Sword Sect? It’s known for being hard to practice, and he probably hadn’t even reached the lesser mastery since he’s in the Elysium Core Realm.”

“This is really weird. I have no explanation for it.” Discussions resounded from the surroundings as everyone’s gazes became grave when they looked at Lin Yun.

As the crimson ‘Ming’ slowly descended like heaven under Huang Xuanyi’s control, the surrounding space began to shatter inch by inch, and this scene made everyone’s hearts pump rapidly.

But just when the crimson ‘Ming’ was about to finish its descent, Lin Yun suddenly opened his eyes and thrust his sword at it. When the Flower Burial Sword stabbed the center of the crimson ‘Ming,’ a massive Netherflower that looked like a dark hole appeared behind him.

The sword tip first created a fine crack in the crimson ‘Ming,’ and a mighty corrosive power exploded. The ‘Ming’ word was slowly being corroded, and the saint runes embedded on the ‘Ming’ slowly became dark. Not long later, black snowflakes fell from the sky, corroding all of the saint runes.

This scene shocked everyone because they didn’t expect the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra to be so powerful.

“How is this possible?”

“How can Lin Yun possibly corrode saint runes with his nether energy when he’s only at the Elysium Core Realm?” No one was willing to believe Lin Yun could reach higher than the third stage with the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra, but the reality was right before their eyes.

As the saint runes were being corroded, the crimson ‘Ming’ power dropped before it slowly crumbled. But Lin Yun didn’t stop there. He charged forth with his sword, completely shattering that word. When the ‘Ming’ was destroyed, the Golden Crow Wings unfolded behind him and he began to shine with golden radiance. Lin Yun was shining brightly like a sun as he shuttled through space. His speed was so fast that not even Huang Xuanyi could track him, and his sword was like a reaper that had descended.

This changed Huang Xuanyi’s face because Lin Yun’s speed was much faster after using the Golden Crow Wings. With no solution, Huang Xuanyi could only execute the Lightning Saint Physique and rely on his instincts to dodge.

But with one sword after another, the speed of the Flower Burial Sword in Lin Yun’s hand kept increasing. Facing his sword, Huang Xuanyi could only duck left and right, but he still couldn’t break free from Lin Yun’s sword aura. He was like a dragon, and the Flower Burial Sword was like a dragon whip in the hands of a deity. No matter how Huang Xuanyi struggled, he was ultimately trapped in it and would occasionally suffer a lash.

Not long later, Huang Xuanyi was covered in injuries, and this scene shocked all the spectators. Within Lin Yun’s hand, the power of the Firmament Sword Intent was fully unleashed, and none of them was willing to blink their eyes.

“This is the true Firmament Sword Intent?” Nangong Yan began to tremble as he watched. He could sense that his Firmament Blade Intent was on a different level when compared to Lin Yun. The Firmament Sword Intent’s true glory was fully exhibited in Lin Yun's hands.

Huang Xuanyi’s forehead was covered in sweat, and he didn’t have the time to consider what others thought of him. If he relaxed for even a moment, he would die under Lin Yun’s sword, and he had never sensed this kind of danger before when amongst those of the same generation.

“Lightning Abyss, Radiant Sun!” Huang Xuanyi roared as he pushed the Lightning Saint Physique to an unprecedented height. A lightning vortex appeared behind him, giving off the feeling that there was an ancient beast hiding within.

This made the hearts of all Sword Sect’s disciples tremble because it was the Great Sun Seal. Since Huang Xuanyi had a serendipitous encounter, he grasped the secret technique of the Great Sun Seal, which could perfectly fuse with his saint physique.

This made everyone wonder if Lin Yun could withstand it. No one had expected that not only did Lin Yun not block Huang Xuanyi’s attack, but his attacks also became even more ferocious.

A vortex appeared within Lin Yun’s violet palace, and the ancient cauldron slowly rose from the astral energy ocean.

“You’re courting death!” Huang Xuanyi’s pupils joyfully flashed as a sun flew out from the lightning vortex. But when the sun just rose into the sky, it was severed into two by Lin Yun. While Huang Xuanyi was rapidly retreating, a sword ray left a crack in his saint armor, forcing him to throw out mouthfuls of blood.

“Abyssal Prison!” Huang Xuanyi roared, and the lightning vortex behind him manifested into a pillar, instantly forming a prison that would trap Lin Yun within.

“Die!” Huang Xuanyi lost it and formed seals with his hands to empower the prison.

Lin Yun no longer held back at this moment and manipulated the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron with the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra, pushing his cultivation to the limit. When he kept swinging the Flower Burial Sword, the prison was easily sliced apart like bamboo, giving others the feeling as though it was as fragile as beancurd and not a ghost spirit martial technique.

“How many trump cards do you still have?!” Huang Xuanyi nearly went insane because, before this, he didn’t even have to resort to his trump cards and was invincible amongst the same generation. But when facing Lin Yun, not only was his common sense destroyed, it even caused an unimaginable impact on his heart.

When the two collided and exchanged a few hundred moves, they landed on a pavilion. Ten moves later, Lin Yun knocked away the saint sword that was in Huang Xuanyi’s hand. But that wasn’t all. Lin Yun swung three swords, slashing at the same spot and tore Huang Xuanyi’s saint armor apart.

“You lost.” Lin Yun sheathed his sword and placed his palm on Huang Xuanyi’s head, pushing it down before the latter could even speak. Just like that, Huang Xuanyi fell to his knees before everyone, making the entire manor silent. All the Elysium Core Realm geniuses could feel their scalps tingling as they looked at Lin Yun.

“First on the Elysium Core Realm? Nothing impressive at all. You want to sweep through the Ancient Barren Domain with only this much strength? You should go back and train for a few more years!” Lin Yun said as he turned around and left.

His words made Huang Xuanyi’s face turn red. He couldn’t accept this humiliation. He refused to accept his defeat. A sun and a moon suddenly manifested behind him again, forming into the Divine Sun Moon Altar.

“Backstab?” Everyone present was shocked because they never thought someone like Huang Xuanyi would resort to a backstab.

Just when Mu Xueqin and others were about to make a move, Lin Yun merely turned around and glanced at Huang Xuanyi, executing the Divine Dragon Eyes. As a draconic roar echoed from Lin Yun’s body, his glance shattered the incomplete Divine Sun Moon Altar.

When Huang Xuanyi raised his head and looked Lin Yun in the eyes, his eyeballs exploded, and his screams echoed across the horizon.

This scene left everyone dumbfounded, and the scene of Lin Yun turning back was deeply engraved in their minds.
