Chapter 1489 - Picking the Lightflow Saint Fruit (2)

A youth donned in crimson armor decorated with golden threads appeared. This youth’s aura was condensed, and he was radiating a terrifying vitality that instantly made everyone feel a chill down their spines.

“It’s the transcendent genius of the Blood Rain Pavilion!”

“Why is a genius like him here instead of the Dragon Burial Valley?” Several people whispered, looking at the youth with fear lingering in their pupils.

“Cousin!” The Blood Rain Pavilion’s woman rejoiced as she ran over. In response, the youth lightly nodded his head indifferently.

“Why are you so late?” That woman grumbled.

“Senior Brothers and others ran into some trouble while attacking the Dragon Burial Valley. I took some time to come, and I must rush back once I’m done here.” The youth said while he walked forth.

He stood directly beneath the tree as countless leaves flew over. But he relied on his armor to withstand the attacks and retrieved a Lightflow Saint Fruit before tossing it to the woman from the Blood Rain Pavilion.

Seeing this, she suddenly thought of something and said, “Cousin. That person obtained two saint fruits, and that woman scolded me earlier!”

“Who dares to scold my woman? Is she tired of living?” The youth’s eyes flashed with killing intent, and the surrounding temperature suddenly dropped, instantly making everyone feel a chill down their spines.

“Ye Qingli, it has been a long time.” An Liuyan smiled when the youth turned around.

When that youth by the name of Ye Qingli saw An Liuyan, the killing intent on his face disappeared, and he exclaimed, “Envoy An, what are you doing here?”

“Your killing intent earlier was really shocking.” An Liuyan smiled.

“My woman is ignorant. Bring it here.” Ye Qingli smiled awkwardly. As he spoke, he took the Lightflow Saint Fruit in the hand of the woman from the Blood Rain Pavilion. He then threw it to An Liuyan before leaving with that woman, unwilling to stay for another second. “This is a gift of apology from me.”

“What are you doing? That Lightflow Saint Fruit belongs to me!” That woman yelled out anxiously.

But Ye Qingli slapped her and yelled, “Shut up! Who are you to interfere in my talks? It’s just a Lightflow Saint Fruit. I can just get another one for you!”

The woman’s eyes turned red, and she no longer dared to utter a word. But when she turned around to look at An Liuyan, her gaze was vicious. This made Lin Yun feel uncomfortable, but he didn’t say a word, so he immediately turned around and left. As for An Liuyan, she stowed the Lightflow Saint Fruit and followed behind him.

“So she’s An Liuyan of the thirteen envoys. No wonder even Ye Qingli gave her face…” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“I heard that she has an astronomical sum of wealth. Many cultivators, whether they are on the righteous or demonic path, are willing to befriend her.”

“But I have no impression of the man beside her.” There were many eyes on An Liuyan and Lin Yun, even after they left.

An hour later, Lin Yun opened his eyes and let out a breath. His eyes were shining brightly. After consuming the Lightflow Saint Fruit, his ocean of astral energy had grown to 17,000 feet, and the number of saint aura strands had expanded to 1,700. The effects of the Lightflow Saint Fruit were miraculous, and it could be considered a powerful treasure.

But his cultivation didn’t make a breakthrough to the five-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm as rumored because he still had a bottleneck.

“Looks like the rumors aren’t that true.” Lin Yun looked at An Liuyan, who had also refined a Lightflow Saint Fruit.

An Liuyan was confused when she heard that. “By rights, those beneath six-star should increase by a star after consuming the Lightflow Saint Fruit. What’s the previous size of your astral energy ocean and saint aura?”

“16,000 feet and 1,400 strands.” Lin Yun replied truthfully.

An Liuyan fell into silence upon hearing that before she said, “You’re really a monster. Ordinary people at the six-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm only have an ocean of astral energy of 10,000 feet. It will be unreasonable if you still make a breakthrough with the Lightflow Saint Fruit.”

“Wait here for me. I’ll be back shortly.” Lin Yun said.

“Where are you going? You’re willing to throw a tiny, weak woman like me behind?” An Liuyan grumbled.

But when Lin Yun looked at the sheer size of her chest, he had no idea how she was tiny or weak. He soon recollected his gaze and disappeared with a few flickers.

Half an hour later, he returned to where the tree was and saw a lot more corpses on the ground. Only forty-odd Lightflow Saint Fruits were left, and the number of people in the surroundings also decreased. He briefly waited for everyone to leave after they couldn’t find a solution to safely obtain the Lightflow Saint Fruit.

When everyone left, Lin Yun appeared, and stopped outside the range of the tree in deep thought. The holy light enveloping the tree was equivalent to a barrier, and it would attack anyone who enters the light. So it was practically impossible to harm that tree. If he didn’t enter the barrier, it was impossible to obtain the Lightflow Saint Fruits. But if he entered the barrier, he would have to face the attacks of the tree, and this was an unsolvable situation.

Taking a step forth, the tree instantly recognized his aura, and hundreds of leaves flew towards him. Simultaneously, countless tree branches lashed out like whips at him.

With a single thought, eight thousand dragon runes formed into armor that enveloped him. No matter how the branches and leaves landed on him, they would only cause sparks to fly, and none of the attacks could inflict any injury on him.

Carefree 9 Swords—Earth Sword Form!

Lin Yun stretched his hand out to summon the Flower Burial Sword. With a flick of his wrist, he unleashed over thirty swords. When the sword rays flashed, the Lightflow Saint Fruits that were severed from the tree briefly hovered in the air before they flew away. But under the gravity of his sword technique, the Lightflow Saint Fruits that flew away slowed down.

Azure Dragon Grasp!

Sheathing his sword, Lin Yun waved his hand, and a vortex formed in his palm, instantly pulling thirty-six saint fruits over. When he raised his head, the tree was bald. Not only were there no fruits left, but the leaves were also gone.

Taking a step back, Lin Yun left the scope of the tree. As he examined the bald tree, Lin Yun asked, “Lil’ Purple, does this tree still have any value? Should we move it to the Iris Secret Realm?”

But the tree began to tremble when it heard what Lin Yun said. It pulled itself from the ground with its roots forming into two feet and ran away, disappearing in a flash. This scene made Lil’ Purple’s lips twitch, and she couldn’t help complaining, “You’re a beast!”
