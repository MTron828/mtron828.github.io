Chapter 1709 – Harmony

“Young Master Lin, you’re a little too impulsive today.” An Liuyan smiled.

Lin Yun didn’t say a word because he knew he was too impulsive. After all, this was the Heavenly Star Pavilion. Since An Liuyan dared to let Liu Chenxin in, she naturally had ways to deal with him. But it didn’t matter because no man could endure it after hearing Liu Chenxin’s terms.

“Here are three Heavenly Snow Lotus’ hearts, and they should be able to help you recover from your injuries.” An Liuyan took the Heavenly Snow Lotus’ hearts out and placed them before Lin Yun.

Opening the box, the Heavenly Snow Lotus’ hearts were crimson like blood, but they also gave off a sacred and holy feeling. Lin Yun was surprised because he thought An Liuyan was lying to Liu Chenxin. After all, a Heavenly Snow Lotus’ heart was already priceless, but An Liuyan managed to obtain three. It’s no wonder why she didn’t make a contract with him for such a long time.

“Since you already have three, why did you still want to buy more?” Lin Yun asked.

“I just want it to be safe, not to mention that you must recover from your injuries quickly. You have already wasted a lot of time, so you can’t possibly wait for six months.” An Liuyan said.

Taking a deep breath, Lin Yun finally understood what An Liuyan had done for him. He said, “I owe you too much.”

“It’s fine. I'm happy that I can just stay beside you.” An Liuyan smiled, and her smile was gentle.

“Young Master Lin, hurry up and refine them. I have already prepared a place for you. There’s a secret realm within the Heavenly Star Pavilion. Regardless of the commotion, no one will disrupt you.” An Liuyan stowed the Heavenly Snow Lotus’ hearts back in the box.

She was thoughtful, and she even prepared a place for him to refine the Heavenly Snow Lotus’ hearts.

An hour later, in an isolated space within the Heavenly Star Pavilion’s secret realm. A spiritual lake was long prepared, and An Liuyan dropped the Heavenly Snow Lotus’ hearts in it and mixed in some herbs.

It didn’t take long for bubbles to start rising on the lake along with a heat wave. The entire lake looked like a terrifying pool of blood.

“Young Master Lin previously said that the effects of the leaves would gradually weaken over time. So I initially wanted to prepare five to help you recover from your injuries, but we only have three now. I’m not sure if you can fully recover with three.” An Liuyan said.

“There are only two dragon pulses left to repair, so it should be enough.” Lin Yun said after a brief pondering.

“Then, let me help you undress.” An Liuyan smiled.

When Lin Yun hesitated, An Liuyan’s hand had already come in contact with him, so he gave up all resistance. After he was done undressing, An Liuyan smiled, “You don’t need to refine the herbal lake; you just need to soak yourself in it. I’ll be taking my leave, first.”

As Lin Yun soaked himself in the herbal lake, he looked at An Liuyan, and ripples spread out in his heart. An Liuyan was charming, and it was hard for him to resist her charm.

Lin Yun’s hand reached toward An Liuyan’s face, which made An Liuyan blush. But despite blushing, flames were blazing within the depths of her pupils, as if she was looking forward to Lin Yun taking another step forth.

“Young Master, do you want me to stay behind?” An Liuyan reached out and grabbed Lin Yun’s hand. Her hand was soft, but she firmly held onto Lin Yun’s hand.

“I can refuse you, but I can’t accept myself losing you, just like what happened earlier. Even if I know you’ll be fine, I’m still worried that you might suffer just to collect Heavenly Snow Lotus’ hearts for me and do something impulsive.” Lin Yun said. He had this chance in the future, but he would reject or maintain a distance with her and only treat her as a friend. Even after their relationship became closer, they still didn’t cross that line.

“That’s enough.” An Liuyan’s eyes welled up with tears, and she said, “That’s enough. What you said is enough. I’m only a demoness in the eyes of others. Many people are eyeing me, but no one treats me like you do. You saved me in the Dragon Remnant Astral Realm and even gave me the White Dragon Bone. Young Master Lin must have other women around you, but I don’t want to compete for anything. It’s enough as long as I have a position in your heart.

“Although I didn’t say anything earlier, I was happy that you made a move earlier.” An Liuyan mustered her courage to look at Lin Yun. Her love was pitiful, but it was real.

Lin Yun was dazed, looking at An Liuyan. As he reached out, An Liuyan gently floated to the lake. He asked, “You won’t regret it?”

“I’ll never regret it.” An Liuyan looked at Lin Yun.

Breathing out a sigh of relief in his heart, Lin Yun knew there were many people after his life, but An Liuyan firmly stood beside him. To buy Heavenly Snow Lotus’ heart for him, An Liuyan was willing to interact with a scumbag like Liu Chenxin.

Although An Liuyan didn’t say anything, he knew she must’ve suffered a lot to gather the three Heavenly Snow Lotus’ hearts for him. If he let her down, he knew how sad she would become. Most importantly, Lin Yun realized he had a spot for An Liuyan in his heart.

He didn’t attack Liu Chenxin because of his friendship with An Liuyan but because she had a position in his heart. Thus, he couldn’t accept seeing her being bullied by anyone else.

“If you won’t regret it, then I…”

When Lin Yun was about to speak, An Liuyan suddenly covered his mouth and said, “You don’t need to speak much, and I’m satisfied knowing that I have a position in your heart. You don’t have to give me any promises, and this is my first time. I hope that Young Master Lin can be gentle.”

Her voice became softer when she spoke, and her face was red. When she raised her head again, she gradually removed her clothes and was only left with her undergarments. But since she was in the lake, her body was damp, and the undergarments were sticking to her figure. This further outlined her figure, and her half-concealed and half-revealed peaks looked even more outstanding.

With a smile, An Liuyan gradually got close to Lin Yun before their bodies came in contact. In the next moment, the lake water started splashing around.

It had been long since Lin Yun felt so relaxed, and the interaction with An Liuyan was so beautiful that it couldn’t be described with words. He was soon submerged in it. Although this was An Liuyan’s first time, her knowledge had opened Lin Yun’s eyes. It was so much so that Lin Yun could sense two warm currents flowing within their bodies, and his injuries were recovering even faster.

After asking An Liuyan, Lin Yun learned that it was the secret cultivation technique of the Heavenly Demon Canon. An Liuyan did browse through it, but it was her first time using it. If Lin Yun also cultivated it, it would benefit them even more.

After knowing that this secret technique could speed up the recovery of Lin Yun’s injuries, An Liuyan was even happier, and no longer had any reservations about using it. An Liuyan was charming in the fog and had no qualms about using the secret technique. At this moment, she gave her beloved her heart and body.

Their kisses were like two serpents trying to indulge in each other’s tastes, trying to give the other party their everything. Occasionally, violent ripples would spread out on the lake.

A long time later, harmony descended between the two of them. Lin Yun and An Liuyan felt delighted in their hearts and bodies. When Lin Yun lowered his head to look at An Liuyan, he saw that she was exhausted and was weakly lying on Lin Yun.

At this moment, she looked charming, and An Liuyan smiled, “Young Master Lin, check your injuries.” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

When Lin Yun examined his injuries, he was shocked to discover that he had completely recovered. Furthermore, countless saint auras began to flow into his violet palace. Not only did he recover all four of his dragon pulses, but they had gotten even stronger.

“Where did the saint aura come from?” Just when Lin Yun was puzzled at the improvement of his cultivation, he suddenly recalled the Myriad Flowers Wine. The saint aura stored within the Myriad Flowers Wine for a thousand years nourished his every cell, and he could absorb it after his dragon pulses were recovered.

“I’m fully recovered.” Lin Yun said, opening his eyes.

This made An Liuyan rejoice, and she finally felt relieved. After knowing Lin Yun’s injuries, she was worried about this for a long time. She then immediately started searching for the Heavenly Snow Lotus’ hearts when she came to Heavenly Domain City.

Since the leaves were no longer effective, she began to look for the hearts of Heavenly Snow Lotus at all costs. She was worried about Lin Yun every single day. When he finally recovered from his injuries, she breathed a sigh of relief.

“Can I undergo my tribulation here?” Lin Yun asked. He could sense that his cultivation was improving rapidly due to the Myriad Flowers Wine, so Mu Xueling didn’t lie to him.

“You can, but will you be alright to undergo your tribulation now?” An Liuyan asked in a worried tone.

“I’ll be fine. The Azure Dragon Lord gave me a droplet of the Blue Dragon’s Divine Blood, and my physique has gotten much stronger. So you don’t have to worry about me.” Lin Yun replied.

“I believe you. You’re the best.” An Liuyan smiled.
