Chapter 482 - Bai Yi

The beautiful sword empowered by xiantian sword intent charged down, showcasing its absolute destruction. Lin Yun had just grasped this attack and he hadn’t used it against anyone yet. The old man was the first person, but he definitely wouldn’t be the last.

“No!” The old man’s face changed drastically when he sensed Lin Yun’s xiantian sword intent. He wanted to retreat, but it was already too late. Before he could even react, the earthshaking attack devoured him whole. The attack pierced through his chest and took his life instantly.

But before the old man died, he managed to throw out a palm at full power. A meteorite descended from the sky that was empowered by the old man’s marital soul.

Lin Yun’s face changed drastically. All he could do was try to block this attack, but he had exhausted all his power by executing the Thunderbolt Slash. With a huge explosion, Lin Yun was knocked away.

He slowly lost his consciousness as he fell into the lake. Before he closed his eyes, he could see Lil’ Red neighing anxiously by the lake. The undercurrent in the lake was rapid and the impact made him wish he was dead.

He was already injured and his consciousness was blurred. Even if he could open his eyes, all he would see is darkness. He couldn’t even move his fingers, not to mention circulate his origin energy. He had suffered unprecedented injuries and he was no longer in control of his life.

Am I dead? Lin Yun gradually regained his consciousness, but had no idea how long he had been out. Although he wasn’t sure how much time had passed, he was relieved because he felt pain. Pain only meant one thing, he was still alive. However, he still couldn’t move his body, so his body was carried by the current.

Occasionally, there were waves that would sink him into the water. Throughout the ride, Lin Yun struggled to stay alive by sheer willpower alone. He never expected that a greater Yin stage of the Violet Palace Realm would be so powerful.

Although his consciousness was hazy, he could still sense that he was saved by someone. He could also vaguely hear their voices.

“Interesting, he’s actually still alive after such injuries. I wonder where he came from.”

“Even if he isn’t dead, he’s probably crippled. It’s impossible for him to be a cultivator anymore in the future. Let’s leave him…”

“No, he’ll die if we leave him.”

Lin Yun finally had a moment to relax after suffering from the current for such a long time.

A few days later, Lin Yun struggled to open his eyelid. He found himself in a room filled with junk. The room also had a moldy smell.

A junk room? Lin Yun could tell that the place he was lying in had clearly been cleaned up by someone. He let out a breath and tried to touch his forehead, but he was powerless. His throat was dry and he was in an extremely weakened state.

When he looked within his body, he was greatly shocked because seven out of his ten profound veins were in a barely visible state. The remaining three were a mess and they even had traces of being burned.

“Holy…” Lin Yun’s face sank. Back then, he couldn’t be bothered about his inner injuries in the fight with the old man. But he didn’t expect to be so heavily injured. If someone else was in his position, they would be crippled after suffering such heavy injuries.

But this was still within the acceptable range for the Dracophant Battle Physique. He could heal from his injuries as long as he had enough time. However, this battle had also given Lin Yun a lesson not to be so careless. Otherwise, he wouldn’t even know how he died.

“I should be on a boat right now,” muttered Lin Yun as he looked around. He still didn’t know who had saved him, but he wasn’t exactly happy about his current state. After all, anyone could kill him in this state. So what he had to do right now was to heal up from his injuries.

But when he reached out to the interspatial pouch on his waist, his face changed. His interspatial pouch was gone, but that wasn’t all. Even the sword box he had always been carrying was gone. Did he lose them in the lake or did someone take them away from him?

Lin Yun’s gaze became dark because it wasn’t funny if it was the latter. His interspatial pouch had a Heavenly Soul Realm beast core and the rose painting that contained boundless secrets, not to mention the Scarletflame War Flag and other treasures. As for the sword box, it contained his personal sword.

Just when Lin Yun was in deep thought, the door suddenly opened. A beautiful woman that looked to be fifteen or sixteen walked in.

“Oh, you’re awake!” The girl rejoiced when she saw that Lin Yun was awake. But when she thought of something, she bashfully took several steps back. After all, they were opposite sex, so it wasn’t appropriate for her to pounce over.

Looking at her, Lin Yun couldn’t help but to smile, “My name is Lin Yun. Are you the one who saved me?”

“So your name is Lin Yun. I’m Bai Yi. I saw you floating on the water three days ago and got my senior brothers to fish you up,” said the gentle girl.

“Thank you for your care. May I know where am I right now? How far is this place from the Sword Firmament Pavilion?” Lin Yun wanted to ascertain his current position.

“The Sword Firmament Pavilion? I’ve never heard of it…” Bai Yi locked her brows together.

“What about the Great Qin Empire?” asked Lin Yun. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Oh, that’s an intermediate force in the Nether Prefecture. This is the Raging Dragon River, it’s far from the Great Qin Empire. Even a Heavenly Soul Realm expert would have to travel for half a month to reach the Great Qin Empire.” Bai Yi’s eyes lit up the moment the Great Qin Empire was mentioned.

“Nether Prefecture?” questioned Lin Yun.

“You don’t know about the Nether Prefecture? That’s weird…” Bai Yi continued, “The Ancient Southern Domain was separated into nine prefectures in ancient times. The Nether Prefecture was located in the west and the Great Qin Empire is located at the borders of the Nether Prefecture.”

Lin Yun finally understood her words. He did hear Guardian Plum saying something about that before. If he was right, the Nether Prefecture’s overlord was the Profound Yang Palace. Every prefecture had a prefectural city that was larger than one of the Great Qin Empire’s counties. Since he was out, then he naturally had to look around.

“Right, Miss Bai, have you seen my interspatial pouch and sword box?” asked Lin Yun. He had nearly forgotten about his things.

“This…” Bai Yi revealed a difficult expression and said, “They’re in the hands of my second senior sister. She said that your origin is unknown, so she’s keeping it for the time being. There’s nothing I can do about it… I’m sorry.”

Lin Yun was a little enraged when he first heard it, but his rage gradually calmed down. He could tell that Bai Yi was a gentle and weak lady and that she would be a target of bullying if she was in the sect.

“It doesn’t matter. Bring me to your senior sister. I’ll talk to her personally. You don’t have to apologize to me,” said Lin Yun as he struggled to get on his feet.

“Don’t move, you’re still injured. My eldest senior sister…” Bai Yi suddenly thought of something and hesitated, “My eldest senior sister instructed that you shouldn’t move around.”

Lin Yun wanted to laugh because he was sure that wasn’t what Bai Yi’s eldest senior sister said. She must’ve said that he would be a cripple in the future. Bai Yi practically revealed all her emotions on her face when talking to him.

“It doesn’t matter. Bring me over,” smiled Lin Yun. He cultivated the Dracophant Battle Physique, so his recovery far exceeded normal people. What he wanted to do right now was to get his interspatial pouch back. After all, he staked his life for the Heavenly Soul Realm beast core, so he would start killing if someone took it.

“Alright, I’ll help you. Be careful.” Bai Yi helped Lin Yun up as they headed to find Bai Yi’s second senior sister. There were people along the way that would look at Lin Yun weirdly with disdain.

But there was no change to Lin Yun’s expression because he could tell that they all had an extraordinary temperament. They wore the same clothes, which meant that they must be from the same sect. Any one of them could compare with the seven titles in the Great Qin Empire.

Aside from Situ Yi and Bai Lixuan, none of the other titles could win against these disciples. Just where did these people come from? Lin Yun couldn’t hide his shock when he realized that even the ordinary disciples could compare to the seven titles. At the same time, he felt that things were becoming more complicated and he could foresee that it wouldn’t be easy to get his things back.

“Bai Yi, you usually act like a pure lady, but you’re actually holding a man right now, not to mention a sword slave with uncertain origin. Don’t tell me that you’ve fallen for this piece of trash…” A voice of mockery sounded out and a girl donned in blue stood at the front. She had tons of boys following behind her.

Each of those boys were strong. Some were in the tenth stage of the Profound Martial Realm, while the rest were in the quasi-Violet Palace Realm. Lin Yun could sense that each of them were powerful and they could suppress the Great Qin Empire’s cultivators in the same cultivation.

But Lin Yun wasn’t focused on that. His gaze was on the girl’s right hand because the girl was holding onto the Flower Burial Sword. Lin Yun instantly narrowed his eyes into slits because this was the first time he saw an outsider holding onto his sword openly in public.
