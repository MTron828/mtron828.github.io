Chapter 1613 - Heavenly Desolation Nine Swords

“Lin Yun!” Everyone was surprised when they heard Lin Yun’s voice and turned around. But before they could react, Lin Yun had landed on the summit under the silver moon.

The Silver-Eyed Demonspirit wielded the Nether Saint Sword while emitting a terrifying demonic aura that enveloped the entire sky. Xuan Feng, Chen Tao, and Xiao Kui were surprised by the Nether Saint Sword’s power. This was why they were in such a pathetic state under the demonic aura.

“Hmph!” Seeing Lin Yun’s appearance, the trio snorted and executed their Glory Saint Artifacts. A jade dragon flew out from the Dragon Manifestation Monument, coiling around Chen Tao. This was a perfect complement to his Glazed Treasure Physique. Xuan Feng’s Golden Vajra emitted a faint Buddhist aura that made him look like an Arhat. Xiao Kui’s Demonblood Blade was enveloped in demonic light that manifested into an ominous beast, Zhu Yan.

But even so, they were still having great difficulties withstanding the demonic aura, and they only ensured they wouldn’t go down on their knees under it. On the other hand, Lin Yun was calm and composed and didn’t seem to be having any difficulty.

This made the three surprised with disbelief. They couldn’t comprehend how Lin Yun managed to maintain his composure while facing the demonic aura.

“The Divine Firmament Sword Sutra!” Xiao Kui suddenly said. This made Chen Tao and Xuan Feng’s eyes light up as they looked at a black flower beneath Lin Yun’s feet. This Netherflower had forty-eight petals. They instantly understood Lin Yun was using the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra’s nether energy to defend against the demonic aura.

“This Silver-Eyed Demonspirit isn’t that terrifying. It’s mainly because of that Nether Saint Sword rendering us helpless. But Lin Yun cultivated the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra, so he’s not feeling any pressure.” Chan Tao said coldly.

“Divine… Firmament Sword Sutra…” The Silver-Eyed Demonspirit’s eyes lit up when he looked at Lin Yun. It might seem mighty, but it had no joy on its face at all. Deep within its pupils was a Netherflower that was like a shackle that was sealing it. No matter how it struggled, it couldn’t break free at all. So the more it struggled, the more helpless it felt. This was why the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit had excitement when it saw Lin Yun.

“Hahaha! The heaven didn’t give up on me, Murong Ke! I have come back to life, destined to reach the summit! At that time, my Divine Blood Clan will return to the Kunlun Realm once more!” The Silver-Eyed Demonspirit’s eyes blazed with flames while looking at Lin Yun.

The demonic corpses attacking the three sects stopped and slowly surrounded Lin Yun. This alleviated Xuan Feng, Chen Tao, and Xiao Kui's pressure. They fell into deep thoughts and exchanged glances. The three immediately had an idea, and they retracted the aura of their Glory Saint Artifacts from the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit.

“Go!” After they stowed their Glory Saint Artifacts, they swiftly led their disciples out of this place. Anyone could tell that the demonic spirits weren’t easy to deal with, and they would have to pay a great price if they stayed here, even if they could make it out alive.

The Silver-Eyed Demonspirit’s attention was on Lin Yun, which was a golden opportunity for them to leave. After leaving the summit, they regathered and looked at the summit. The mountain's summit was enveloped in demonic clouds, and the clouds were so dense that not even moonlight could shine through.

“Are we going to leave just like that?” Xiao Kui still wasn’t willing to leave. “With our strength, we might have a chance if we fight that Silver-Eyed Demonspirit.”

They came from powerful sects and had other trump cards besides their Glory Saint Artifacts.

“Haha. This is the best situation,” Chen Tao smiled. “Lin Yun has trump cards of his own, and he’s probably planning to wait for us to die before obtaining all of the harvests. But I bet he never expected that the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit would turn his attention from us to him. Anyhow, this allowed us to watch them fight.”

“That’s right. Even if the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit managed to deal with Lin Yun, he won’t come out unscathed. At the very least, the Nether Saint Sword’s power will decrease greatly. At that time, we will have a bigger advantage.” Xuan Feng analyzed. They have already reached the pinnacle fourth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, and they could bring out 30-50% of their Glory Saint Artifacts’ powers. The Silver-Eyed Demonspirit wasn’t fully resurrected and would be significantly weakened without the Nether Saint Sword.

“But that Silver-Eyed Demonspirit… seems to have other intentions…” Xiao Kui had an ill premonition. The Silver-Eyed Demonspirit might have been terrifying earlier, but he didn’t give him this ill premonition. But when its attention turned to Lin Yun, this instantly gave Xiao Kui an ill premonition.

“Ha. We’ll just wait and react accordingly.” Xuan Feng and Chen Tao smiled. They weren’t fools. They could tell that something wasn’t right, but they chose to ignore it. They both planned to probe the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit after he fought Lin Yun.

At the mountain summit, the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit didn’t stop the three sects from leaving but controlled the remaining demonic corpses to surround Lin Yun.

“They’re really fast at running.” Lin Yun revealed a mocking smile. He wouldn’t have shown up so quickly if those three weren’t on the verge of going down on their knees. Since the nether energy was too massive, his Divine Firmament Sword Sutra quickly reached the sixth stage in just half an incense’s time.

He initially planned to deal with the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit together with them, but he never expected that they would leave him behind. Then again, there was a reason why they were the chief disciples of their sects.

“Your Divine Firmament Sword Sutra isn’t complete, and you won’t be able to reach complete mastery. If you’re willing to help me, I can grant you a genuine king grade martial technique, equivalent to dragon spirit martial techniques, according to your world’s terms.” The Silver-Eyed Demonspirit said, looking at Lin Yun.

“Oh?” Lin Yun smiled. He knew the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra wasn’t complete because the complete version was in the Great Profound Sword Canon in the Great Profound Palace.

“What do you think? Are you interested?” Murong Ke squinted his eyes with a smile. “You’re not from the Jian Clan. So there’s no need for you to maintain your loyalty, and many forces in the Kunlun Realm have submitted to my Divine Blood Clan!”

“How do you want me to help you?” Lin Yun asked, seemingly interested in Murong Ke’s offer.

“Use your Divine Firmament Sword Sutra to undo the restriction left in my body by Jian Qingkong. Not even Great Saints can undo this seal, but you can because you cultivated the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra. If the restriction loosens, I can come back to life!” Murong Ke opened his eyes with a dazzling light shining in his pupils.

But just when his pupils shone brightly, two Netherflower in his pupils suppressed it. It was as though a terrifying beast was hidden within his pupils, and his body was a cage that caged him in. But that beast was greatly restricted by the Netherflower, and this made the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit’s face distorted with pain as fine cracks appeared on its body.

Lin Yun was surprised by that bizarre nether energy. The Silver-Eyed Demonspirit had a powerful origin energy, but he couldn’t use it. The moment he tried to activate it, he would instantly be suppressed, and blood would drip down the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit’s fingers. That was the blood that he had devoured, and it was slowly flowing out. This was because the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit’s body was already dead, and the blood couldn’t fuse with his body. If he wanted to restore his vitality, he would have to break the restriction.

“What dragon spirit martial technique are you planning to give me?” Lin Yun seemed to have fallen for it.

“You’re a swordsman, so you naturally need a sword sutra. My Divine Blood Clan has an unrivaled sword technique called the Heavenly Desolation Nine Swords. Every sword will manifest into a set of seven glory spirits. One glory spirit has ten-odd sword astrals. After the ninth sword, the glory spirits can manifest into a Sovereign Constellation. Paired with the Heavenly Desolation Sword Sutra, you can form a sword universe within your body after reaching the ninth sword.” The Silver-Eyed Demonspirit said in a tempting voice and continued, “After your sword intent manifests into a universe, even a deity won’t be able to take your sword! With a glance, you can destroy millions of stars and kill a Great Saint.”

Lin Yun’s heart started to throb because no swordsmen could restrain their emotions upon hearing that. Most importantly, this was the same as the Profound Sky Sect’s Profound Sky Canon. It was shocking, regardless of using sword intent to manifest a Sovereign Constellation or create a universe.

“How is it?” The Silver-Eyed Demonspirit smiled.

“Have you cultivated this sword technique?” Lin Yun asked, falling into deep thought.

“I naturally did. How am I going to teach you otherwise?” The Silver-Eyed Demonspirit said pridefully.

“Since that’s the case, why were you defeated and landed in this state?” Lin Yun asked.

The Silver-Eyed Demonspirit’s lips began to twitch because Lin Yun was starting to get on his nerves to rub salt in his wound. Suppressing his anger, the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit said in an unconfident tone, “How could I lose? I was only unlucky to run into someone from the Jian Clan on this ancient battlefield.”

Since the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit called this place an ancient battlefield, he wasn’t an ancient demonspirit, but from the Darkest Era three millennials ago. This place belonged to the Dragon Gate and wasn’t called an ancient battlefield in ancient times. Only after that battle among deities was this place called an ancient battlefield.

“So, do you want the Heavenly Desolation Nine Swords?” The Silver-Eyed Demonspirit didn’t want to spend more time on Lin Yun and asked, “Your friends have fled. Even if you don’t cooperate with me, that doesn’t mean I can’t force you to help me.”

“Give me the technique first,” said Lin Yun.

“Ha. Come over if you dare, and I’ll grant it to you!” The Silver-Eyed Demonspirit said.

This provocation method was flawed, but Lin Yun took several steps toward the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit.

This made the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit comment in a mocking tone, “You really dare to come.”

As the surrounding demonic corpses approached, they sealed off Lin Yun’s path of retreat. The demonic clouds in the sky also became denser, making Lin Yun’s face change. As the demonic aura restricted the surrounding space, he couldn’t unleash his sword intent.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Haha, you tried to pretend to fall for it to numb me, but it’s a pity that this is nothing but pitiful tricks before a genuine expert. I’ll give you the Heavenly Desolation Nine Swords, then!” Murong Ke laughed. His eyes flashed with mockery as his vertical eye slowly opened as he reached out. When his finger fell onto Lin Yun’s brow, his vertical eye opened, and a silver demonic light enveloped him.
