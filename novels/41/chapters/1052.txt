Chapter 1053 - A Swordsman's Will

“No!” The Nether Divinity, Profound Dragon, and Elysium Trigram Realm Sons were all scared silly by Lin Yun’s punch. Everything took place too quickly, even for the other war realms. Clearly, no one had expected Lin Yun to be so strong.

Just like that, Lin Yun’s punch landed on the Nether Divinity Realm Son. A furious roar echoed out in everyone’s ears and a terrifying thought started to form in everyone’s minds. Is the Nether Divinity Realm Son about to die?

It was a thought that gave everyone chills. After all, a Realm Son was a person of nobility in the Heavenly Path that the powerful sects had to give face to. They were like deities who stood above all others. So for a Realm Son to die was unprecedented.

But now, a Realm Son was actually about to die. Suddenly, the Profound Dragon and Elysium Trigram Realm Sons shot over. They charged through the sky like two bright comets. Without hesitation, neither the Profound Dragon Realm Son nor the Elysium Trigram Realm Son hesitated to unleash their holy spirit martial technique.

“Profound Dragon Devouring Palm!”

“Sky Demonic Elephant Devouring Palm!”

The Profound Dragon Realm Son unleashed a gigantic dragon claw with several runes interlocking at the core. His runes had effectively formed a miniature array. The Elysium Trigram Realm Son created countless demonic runes that formed a barbaric elephant.

Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon Saint Armor was shattered at this point, and he would be heavily injured if he insisted on killing the Nether Divinity Realm Son.

“A mere ant like you wants to kill me? Dream on!” The Nether Divinity Realm Son flew into a fury and began to struggle. He still had many trump cards he hadn’t used, so he wasn’t willing to die.

As he struggled, it sounded like his bones were starting to crack. But a brief moment later, his aura started showing signs of life.

“Hahaha!” The Nether Divinity Realm Son laughed as his hair fluttered in the wind. His aura was rising as he formed seals to unleash a trump card.

“My heavens!” Somehow, the Nether Divinity Realm Son actually managed to turn the tables around. As long as the Nether Divinity Realm Son could take Lin Yun’s attack head-on, the two other realm sons’ attacks would be able to harm Lin Yun. It was a scary way for the Nether Divinity Realm Son to use himself as bait.

“The Realm Sons can’t be humiliated! Death to those who dare to humiliate the Realm Sons!” The Nether Divinity War Realm’s geniuses and generals began to sneer when they saw this scene. Flames also blazed in the depth of their pupils.

The Nether Divinity Realm Son’s lack of pride had left many people surprised. AFter all, he was relying on two other Realm Sons to help him out.

“Haha, Lin Yun, you’re still too tender to compete with me. Kneel and beg for death!” The Nether Divinity Realm Son laughed while he began to form seals even faster. But right at this moment, a pair of golden wings appeared behind Lin Yun, pushing his speed to the limit as he teleported above the Nether Divinity Realm Son.

Without any hesitation, his punch landed on the head of the Nether Divinity Realm Son, directly smashing him into the ground. The Nether Divinity Realm Son was only one step away from finishing his seals before he was smashed into the ground. His laughter was still echoing in everyone’s ears, which showed how fast Lin Yun was.

A brief moment later, a huge explosion sounded out from the ground as boundless flames poured out from the cracks. Everyone was dumbfounded by Lin Yun’s attack. Just how strong was Lin Yun’s attack that he even destroyed a flame vein?

“Impossible!” The geniuses from the Nether Divinity War Realm were completely dumbstruck as their bodies began to tremble. They couldn’t accept that their Nether Divinity Realm Son was actually smashed into the ground by Lin Yun.

“Kill him!” At the same time, the attacks of the two Realm Sons had arrived as their attacks devoured Lin Yun. Their eyes were red with fury as they roared, “This bastard has to die!”

Lin Yun merely flapped his wings to push the Golden Crow Nine Transformation to the limit. The attacks from the two Realm Sons only managed to destroy his afterimages in the end.

But it was still dangerous for him as the two attacks chased after him. The scale of the phenomena was so terrifying that there was no path of retreat for Lin Yun.

“That bastard still isn’t dead?” The geniuses of the war realms were so furious they almost threw up blood. Right at this moment, Lin Yun sucked in a cold breath as purple-bolden runes began to squirm on the surface of his body. Beads of sweat covered his forehead as his sword intent and heart began to beat.

Seeing that the two attacks were about to devour him, Lin Yun recalled how the Azure Dragon Lord destroyed his attack with a simple grab. His eyes turned red as he wore a grave expression. After all, he still hadn’t recovered from exhausting his vitality. In this weakened state, he had no way to catch his breath.

He might not be able to execute the Azure Dragon Lord’s move perfectly in his current state, but he knew that he wasn’t about to die. He was here to save Yue Weiwei, and he also had someone to meet, so his will as a swordsman wouldn’t allow him to fall.

Releasing a roar, his clothes and hair began to flutter violently. Then, the dragon runes on his body shined brightly as he made a vortex of thunderstorms. As the dragon runes squirmed, Lin Yun reached out and grabbed onto the space before him.

Just like that, Lin Yun grabbed onto the dragon claw and the elephant before crushing them into pieces. The boundless phenomena disappeared mysteriously, causing everyone to widen their eyes with disbelief. Those who were calling for Lin Yun’s death were dumbfounded.

Everyone widened their eyes as they looked at the youth hovering in the air. His face was pale and blood dripped down from his eyes. Then, Lin Yun roared, “Lil’ Red, go!”

Lil’ Red swung its staff, tearing apart several of the war realm geniuses. Afterwards, Lil’ Red turned into a black figure and charged towards Yue Weiwei.

“You’re courting death!” The Realm Sons flew into rage when they saw a mere cat do as it pleased to their war realms.

“Here, you guys can have it back!” Lin Yun suddenly loosened his grip, tossing two attacks back at the Realm Sons in a ferocious manner. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“You bastard!” The Realm Sons cursed. Afterwards, Lin Yun let out a sigh as his Golden Crow and Silver Phoenix flew out of his body once more. His pale complexion swiftly became rosy as his hair fluttered wildly in the wind.
