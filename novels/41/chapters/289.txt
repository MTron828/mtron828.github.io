Chapter 290 - A Messy Fight

The tricolored auspicious sign was spectacular and it could clearly be seen from the observation platform. All the disciples and elders on the platform held their breath because they knew that the battle was starting. The contest for the Imperial Sword Herb was starting and the results would be revealed in a few hours at best.

“It’s finally starting. Normally there aren’t any disciples, so the demonic beasts can fight over the Imperial Sword Herb ferociously. The brutality of their fights is something that you can’t imagine.”

“Compared to a demonic beast’s physique, a cultivator’s physique is much weaker. I wonder if they’ll be able to resist the sword intent coming from the Imperial Sword Herb.”

“Yeah. If you aren’t careful, you’ll become covered in wounds.”

“I wonder who will stand out.” Discussions could be heard as everyone curiously watched.

“Isn’t it obvious? Chu Haoyu will naturally take it first. After all, he’s ranked first. Who else can compete with him?”

Bai Ting smiled. He looked confident as he threw a provocative glance towards Luo Feng. “Elder Luo Feng, 1,000 second-grade spiritual jades isn’t a small sum. You can hand it over right now.”

“That’s right. Why bother being stubborn. Luck might be a factor, but the end result still depends on strength.”

“Chu Haoyu has the strongest odds. But if it’s not him, then it will be Ye Xiu or Jiang Feng. The fight over the Imperial Sword Herb will be a brutal one and you can’t use tricks for it.”

“Elder Luo Feng, why place your hope on someone who won’t show up?” The elders who had a good relationship with Bai Ting said all of this with smiles.

“You guys seem rather confident. Since you guys are so confident why don’t you place some bets too?” replied Luo Feng with a composed smile.

Seeing that Luo Feng showed no signs of taking a step back, the elders all became furious.

“So be it! I’ll place 500 second-grade spiritual jades on Chu Haoyu getting the first Imperial Sword Herb!”

“Hehe, it’s so great that Elder Luo Feng wants to give us spiritual jades for free. I’ll place my bet on Ye Xiu! 800 second-grade spiritual jades!”

“I’ll place my bet on Jiang Feng! He’s ranked third after all.”

After all the elders placed their bets, Bai Ting sneered, “Old geezer, I’ll see if you can smile later on. We now have about 5,000 second-grade spiritual jades in the bet.”

A bomb suddenly exploded on the stage. The bet had reached an astronomical sum, startling all the disciples. Lin Yun experienced life and death to obtain 1,200 second-grade spiritual jades, but the bet between elders reached 5,000!

They were, after all, elders, so disciples couldn’t be compared to them. When everyone from the Locket Mountain heard about the bet between elders, they became startled. Mo Cheng smiled, “And here I thought Senior Sister Xin Yan was going insane with 5,000 first-grade spiritual jades. It turns out that we’re not even close to the bet by the elders.”

“It looks like Elder Luo Feng shares the same view as me. He’s also confident in junior brother,” smiled Xin Yan.

Everyone smiled bitterly because they didn’t know how to carry on with the conversation. After all, Lin Yun was still nowhere to be seen. They had no idea where Xin Yan got her confidence from. On the other hand, Wang Yan and everyone from the Gentlemen Union looked at the Burial Sword Peak with confidence.

“Senior Brother Wang, Xin Yan still doesn’t seem to have given up. Does the Locket Mountain really think that Lin Yun will show up?”

“They’re a bunch of fools. They have no idea what Senior Brother Wang did to force Lin Yun into hiding.”

“I’m looking forward to seeing him going after the Imperial Sword Herb. After all, the bounty is meaningless if all he does is hide,” sneered Wang Yan.

The bet between Luo Feng and Bai Ting brought the atmosphere on the observation platform to a whole new level. Currently, everyone was guessing who would obtain the first Imperial Sword Herb. Without a doubt, Chu Haoyu was the most popular vote and 70% of the spiritual jades were on him. As for Ye Xiu and Jiang Feng, they stood in second place.

As for Lin Yun? No one doubted his ability. He definitely had the strength to compete for the Imperial Sword Herb. However, since he had offended everyone in the top ten, it made sense that he wouldn’t show himself in the first round. After all, everyone would besiege him if he dared to show himself.

Many people sighed. This was the consequence of Lin Yun being too high-profiled. If he didn’t forcibly take the four A-ranked missions, he wouldn’t have to hide like a turtle right now, not to mention that he had also offended everyone on the top ten in the ranking.

Aside from Xin Yan and Luo Feng, no one was confident in Lin Yun. The atmosphere in the observation platform was truly on a whole new level.

Lin Qiushan and everyone from the party looked at the island with excitement. The sword intent emitting out from the island and the descending auspicious signs actually caused the entire island to tremble. Suddenly, cracks started spreading out from the island like a cobweb.

At the same time, a jade-white herb broke out from the surface of the earth along with a huge tremor. Everyone could feel their blood boil from the sword buzz. It looked like a small herb, but it wasn’t small at all. It was half a meter in height, emitting a domineering sword intent in the form of ripples.

“That’s the Imperial Sword Herb?” Lin Yun looked at the Imperial Sword Herb with fire blazing in his eyes. Not only him, but all the disciples in the surroundings were looking at the imperial Sword Herb. The herb didn’t seem like a mortal object because of how it looked.

With just a glance at the herb, the sword intent in everyone’s body began to spiral out of control. Other cultivators wouldn’t react so intensely. However, cultivators who had comprehended sword intent felt an irresistible thirst for the Imperial Sword Herb.

Everyone seemed to have an agreement as none of them made their move. On the other hand, Lin Yun looked calm beneath his mask. He knew that the island didn’t seem as calm as it looked, and the surging sword intent wasn’t that simple. Even elites like Gu Feiyun didn’t react rashly.

A series of beastial roars sounded out. A few sixth stage demonic beasts charged over and those who were unlucky enough to stand in their way were knocked over. The demonic beasts were charging towards the island and when they landed on the island, a powerful gale covered the demonic beasts in injuries.

But even so, the demonic beasts persevered and continued to approach the Imperial Sword Herb. The sudden appearance of so many demonic beasts caused the leaders of the various alliance-unions to have a change in expression. After all, the demonic beasts had a strong advantage due to their physique.

“Everyone, you have seen how powerful these demonic beasts are. There’s no way any of us can take them alone. The Imperial Sword Herb will only fall in their hands if we fight among ourselves. Rather than doing that, why don’t we join hands to get rid of them first?” Gu Feiyun smiled, he had delivered these words right as the scene began to shock the crowd.

He might be powerful, but he was alone. He didn’t have any advantage in terms of numbers, not to mention that these demonic beasts were troublesome even for him.

“No matter what, we can’t let these beasts obtain the Imperial Sword Herb,” said Nie Tian.

“Hehe, Brother Wei and I have no objections since Brother Nie have already said so.” Xiao Feng and Wei Songhan exchanged a glance. It sounds like a good idea for them to get rid of the demonic beasts before going after the Imperial Sword Herb. Anyhow, they didn’t fear facing Gu Feiyun with their combined strength.

“I have no objections either,” said Han Feng. The surrounding alliance-unions all agreed to the suggestion, except for Lin Qiushan’s party.

“Brother Zhong, what do you think?” asked Lin Qiushan. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Lin Yun revealed a smile beneath the mask. It looks like Gu Feiyun intends to weaken everyone by using the demonic beasts. Does he really think that the Imperial Sword Herb is his? He replied, “It’s fine. Just agree with him for now. These demonic beasts are indeed in the way.”

“The Will-o'-Wisp Alliance also agrees to it,” yelled Lin Qiushan.

“Then let’s get started,” said Gu Feiyun. He sneered in his heart and drew a greatsword from his back. He charged at the island, towards the demonic beasts. The black sword gleam bolted down and struck a sixth stage demonic beast, splitting it into two.

“This sword technique seems a little ferocious.” Lin Yun focused his gaze and found Gu Feiyun’s sword technique similar to the Dragon-Tiger Fist. It had a ferocious style. A single strike could probably immobilize anyone in the same cultivation. Gu Feiyun’s attack had also sounded the beginning of the battle on the island.

“Let’s get started as well. But be careful. The sword gale on the island is terrifying,” said Lin Qiushan. Her eyes flickered because she knew they would be blamed if they didn’t get started soon.

“Brother Zhong, we’ll create an opportunity for you to snatch the Imperial Sword Herb with the Seven Profound Steps,” whispered Gu Beixuan.

“We’ll go with that plan.” Lin Yun was calm. He knew that everyone would scheme against each other in this messy fight. No one would be foolishly fighting the demonic beasts. The game was just beginning.
