Chapter 1070 - Three Moves Have Passed!

The slap not only left the Nether Divinity Realm Son dumbfounded, but everyone else too. The Nether Divinity Realm Son was in the sixth soul with ten Demonic Astral Flowers in his aura oceans while Lin Yun hadn’t even basked in the Saint Spiritual Lake. So everyone expected that Lin Yun would be heavily injured by the Nether Divinity Realm Son.

It was a surprising outcome to say the least. Even the elders in the sky were dumbfounded. They acknowledged Lin Yun’s potential, but not his current strength. After all, Lin Yun didn’t bask in the Saint Spiritual Lake like the Nether Divinity Realm Son had.

Slamming his palm on the lake, the Nether Divinity Realm Son soared into the sky with a swollen face.

He glared at Lin Yun and coldly said, “Looks like I underestimated you. It seems like you found an opportunity in the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm. But that won’t be enough. No matter your harvest, there’s no way it can compare to my harvest in the Saint Spiritual Lake!”

“Is that so?” Lin Yun asked as he cleaned his hand with the napkin. He felt dirty after slapping the Nether Divinity Realm Son in the face, but killing the Nether Divinity Realm Son instantly would be letting him off too easily. Since the Nether Divinity Realm Son humiliated Luo Chen, he had to pay the price!

“You’re courting death!” The Nether Divinity Realm Son was enraged when he saw Lin Yun’s indifferent attitude. Instantly, all ten Demonic Astral Flowers began to bloom, radiating a light that made his body glow.

“Lin Yun, watch out!” Qin Lin and his group called out subconsciously.

They were far from the Nether Divinity Realm Son, but they could still sense the immense aura coming from the latter. After all, the Demonic Astral Flowers increased the Nether Divinity Realm Son’s aura to an unprecedented height.

Even the people surrounding Qin Lin were nervous. They thought that Lin Yun got lucky and caught the Nether Divinity Realm Son off guard. If the Nether Divinity Realm Son became serious, would Lin Yun even have the chance to turn the tables around?

With a vicious stare, dark light began to bloom behind the Nether Divinity Realm Son. He was unleashing a secret technique belonging to the Nether Divinity War Realm. When he executed it, everyone could sense that his aura had become a lot heavier from the dark light. It was a strength that surprised the other Realm Sons.

The Nether Divinity Realm Son’s gaze was cold as he wouldn’t make another mistake. He decided to empower himself with a secret technique that even empyreans couldn’t find a flaw in.

“You can die now!” The Nether Divinity Realm Son roared. With explosive pressure, he made his move. At this moment, Lin Yun looked like he was frozen by the immense pressure.

The Nether Divinity Realm Son’s pressure enveloped Lin Yun to make the latter kneel. He wanted Lin Yun to feel the humiliation he felt in Wind Mound City. It was the perfect way to vent his anger.

When his palm was about to descend onto Lin Yun, the Nether Divinity Realm Son smiled ecstatically. However, Lin Yun’s figure turned into golden fragments. Was that an afterimage? How is this possible? The Nether Divinity Realm Son was confident that he had unleashed his aura entirely.

The Nether Divinity Realm Son’s eyes bulged out of his head when he realized that Lin Yun executed the Golden Crow Nine Transformations. With every step, Lin Yun left behind afterimages full of lightning. Since each afterimage was filled with thunderstorm energy, it was hard for others to tell which image was real.

Damn it, where is he?! But before the Nether Divinity Realm Son could think, Lin Yun reached out to give him another slap. As Lin Yun’s hand approached his face, a black vortex appeared behind the Nether Divinity Realm Son.

Empowered by ten Demonic Astral Flowers, the Neter Divinity Realm Son’s attack was extremely terrifying. So he blew Lin Yun’s figure into pieces. But once again, it was one of Lin Yun’s afterimages. The Nether Divinity Realm Son began to panic. When he turned around, Lin Yun was already charging over with thunderstorm energy in his palm. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

The Nether Divinity Realm Son was furious, so he threw a series of punches with countless black vortexes. Black light began to streak across the horizon, but all they hit were Lin Yun’s afterimages.

“This is the power of having ten Demonic Astral Flowers?” The Nether Divinity Realm Son’s performance shocked many people. However, once his aura reached its limit, he received a resounding slap to the face. Lightning exploded from Lin Yun’s palm that sent the Nether Divinity Realm Son flying with a swollen left cheek.

“Second move,” said Lin Yun. Everyone in the Saint Spiritual Lake was dumbfounded. What the hell is going on? They were certain that the Nether Divinity Realm Son would crush Lin Yun, but Lin Yun’s thunderstorm intent was unbelievably strong. It wasn’t this strong when he was in Wind Mound City. On top of that, he paired it with his Golden Crow Nine Transformations, which managed to fool the Nether Divinity Realm Son.

“Haha, well done!” Qin Lin roared with laughter as the Nether Divinity Realm Son went flying. All the frustration he felt up to this point was finally resolved by Lin Yun.

Although the reaction of Luo Chen and the others wasn’t as great, they were still happy that Lin Yun was getting revenge for them.

The Elysium Trigram and Profound Dragon Realm Sons could tell that something was wrong. But just when they were about to help, the Nether Divinity Realm Son soared into the sky and roared, “Don’t come over! I’ll crush him myself and make him feel the humiliation I felt…”

However, the moment he finished speaking, Lin Yun charged forward once more. The Nether Divinity Realm Son executed his holy spirit martial technique and unleashed a phoenix from his body, “Soaring Phoenix!”

A water screen rose behind him that started to distort the surrounding space. It was a powerful holy spirit martial technique from the Nether Divinity War Realm.

Then, a sorrowful cry sounded out as Lin Yun grabbed the wings of the Nether Divinity Realm Son’s holy spirit and tore it in two. He completely unleashed his Azure Dragon Sword Aura, which was akin to a real dragon.

This aura comparable to a holy spirit restricted the Nether Divinity Realm Son’s movements. In the next second, Lin Yun grabbed the right shoulder of the Nether Divinity Realm Son. Lin Yun’s actions made the spectators cover their mouths because they knew what was going to happen next.

“You bastard, stop!” The Elysium Trigram and Profound Dragon Realm Sons charged over without any hesitation.

“No! No! Lin Yun, spare me! I’ll even kneel before you…” The Nether Divinity Realm Son was on the verge of crying as he tried to fall to his knees.

“You have no qualification to kneel before me!” said Lin Yun indifferently as he ripped off the Nether Divinity Realm Son’s right arm, causing the latter to scream out in pain.

“Third move,” said Lin Yun coldly. “I told you, I only needed three moves. Now, I’m going to sever one of your arms to uphold my promise!”
