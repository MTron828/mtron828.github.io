Chapter 945 - Heavenly Demonic Dipper Staff

As the two ferocious attacks clashed together, it was a competition between two ‘suns’. There was naturally nothing to say about Mo Yan’s Great Sunblazing heaven because it took half the life of the Gold-furred Demonic Ape when it was trapped.

Otherwise, Wu Mu wouldn’t have the opportunity to shatter the Gold-furred Demonic Ape’s head. All the geniuses were also paying attention to this attack because this would determine the outcome of this fight. After all, advanced fortune martial techniques were too powerful and there was a high possibility that the loser would be directly killed.Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

When the two moves clashed together, Mo Yan who relied on his advantage instantly obtained the upper hand in the fight and pushed the golden brilliance coming from Lin Yun back, even with cracks spreading out.

In the process, countless golden flames rained down on the Ashes Valley which created huge craters on the ground. This made the higher realms’ geniuses face to change into fear. They were all rejoicing at the fact that they didn’t join the battle. After all, just the shockwave alone would be enough to injure them and they would be cannon fodders if they went up.

But looking at this current situation, Mo Yan seems to be holding the advantage in the fight. Although they could sense that Lin Yun’s advanced fortune martial technique was a lot stronger than Mo Yan, the huge difference in their cultivation allowed Mo Yan to fully unleash the might of the Great Sunblazing Heaven.

“Hmph, you’re just a piece of trash from the lower realm. I’ll capture you today and make you kneel before me when the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm opens. Flower Burial? You’re just a joke before me.” Mo Yan already had all his rage pent up in his chest. So when he saw that he could suppress Lin Yun, he quickly started sneering.

But right at this moment, an accident happened with an ancient seal blooming in the huge sun with unprecedented golden brilliance pouring out which made the radiance emitted from Mo Yan become dim.

“A firefly dares to be so impudent?” Lin Yun took a deep breath with the winged human behind him unfolding its wings and shining brightly.

The winged human looked down and the sun Lin Yun threw out also released the dazzling brilliance of a divine sun before shattering Mo Yan’s fist and sending him flying out. When the origin energy around Mo Yan was destroyed, Mo Yan threw out a mouthful of blood before he crashed onto the ground.

Only then, did the winged human behind Lin Yun gradually dimmed down. When Mo Yan struggled to get back up, he didn’t hesitate to turn and run for his left. He didn’t even have the courage to take another glance at Lin Yun which left all the higher realms’ geniuses shocked. After all, only higher realms would rob others but now, they were robbed by Lin Yun even with so many geniuses here?

Mo Yan first recruited six higher realms to seal off the Ashes Mountain Range. But now, he didn’t even dare to glance at Lin Yun and started running for his life. This had left everyone in disbelief. When they recovered from their shock, they also turned around and ran for their lives.

“This…” As for Mu Ziyi who was fighting Lil’ Red, he was also stunned by this scene. Even Mo Yan and Wu Mu couldn’t defeat Lin Yun? How was that possible?!

After all, even they had killed a monarch demonic beast like the Gold-furred Demonic Ape. But now, they were defeated by Lin Yun? Taking the moment he was distracted, a crimson whip flew over that sent him flying out, destroying several spiritual runes around him. When the whip lashed on his face, he could feel the burning pain coming from his cheeks.

“You bastard! Lin Yun, this isn’t over! We’ll meet again at the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm!” Mu Ziyi roared before he ran for his life as well.

“No need to chase after them,” said Lin Yun as he placed the sword box on his back. Right now, aside from Gold-furred Demonic Ape’s corpse, the surroundings were in a mess. All the higher realms’ elites had also retreated without any hesitation fearing that Lin Yun might come after them.

After all, they still remembered the rumour about Yuan Hengtian being stripped. So no one wanted to be the second Yuan Hengtian. But there was still someone left behind. Wu Mu and the Demonic Constellation Realm’s geniuses all left behind with no thoughts of leaving.

“Lin Yun, do you think we can negotiate? Let me have the Gold-furred Demonic Ape’s corpse and I can pay you with resources. Or we can also help you out once,” said Wu Mu. He clearly couldn’t let go of the Gold-furred Demonic Ape’s corpse. Even the Demonic Constellation Realm’s geniuses behind him were also looking at the corpse with yearning in their eyes.

Hearing what Wu Mu had to say, Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts. To be honest, he was really tempted. He might not be lacking resources, but he knew that these people were really ruthless to themselves. Just Wu Mu’s fight with the Gold-furred Demonic Ape alone had left a deep impression on Lin Yun.

If Mo Yan and Mu Ziyi didn’t have Wu Mu standing at the front, it wouldn’t be easy for them to kill the Gold-furred Demonic Ape. The Gold-furred Demonic Ape’s corpse was a treasure, but Lin Yun only needed its beast core to cultivate his Divine Glorysun Fist. As for its corpses and eyes, he didn’t really need them.

But just when he wanted to make a decision, Lil’ Red ran over and shook its head. Lin Yun instantly recalled that Lil’ Red had cultivated the Ancient Dracoape Art. So it probably wanted to use the Gold-furred Demonic Ape’s bloodline to cultivate. This meant that he couldn’t give them to Wu Mu.

When Wu Mu noticed Lin Yun’s expression, he immediately spoke out, “Your Dragon-blooded Cat has a mutated bloodline. It can use the Gold-furred Demonic Ape’s blood essence to reach the second soul Heavenly Soul Realm. But it shouldn’t need all of it. It’s enough if you can leave behind one-third of it for me. As for the remaining corpse, I don’t need it.”

Lin Yun turned to look at Lil’ Red when he heard that, but he noticed that Lil’ Red was staring at the iron staff Wu Mu was holding. This instantly left him speechless because Lil’ Red was really obsessed with dao artifacts. He already had Void Blade and Blood Viperwhip, but he still wanted Wu Mu’s staff?

But Lin Yun had to admit that Wu Mu’s dao artifact was truly formidable. It was heavy and the spiritual runes on it were extremely ancient. Most importantly, he still remembered how this staff broke into the Gold-furred Demonic Ape’s head.

Sensing Lil’ Red’s gaze, Wu Mu was briefly stunned before he laughed, “Haha. This dao artifact of mine is called the Heavenly Demonic Dipper Staff, forged with demonic dipper metal. I don’t have to explain about its weight. You can wield it because your physique is strong enough, and the true power of this staff lies in the saint runes. The grades might not be high, but it was extremely ancient. Even in Kunlun Realm, no one could fully wield it.

“Even I can’t unleash its true power. According to what was recorded by my ancestors, the demonic dipper metal will truly shine only if someone is capable of wielding it completely.”

Lin Yun could tell that Wu Mu wasn’t lying by glancing at the staff. This Heavenly Demonic Dipper Staff was truly formidable. At the very least, Lin Yun could tell that it had a huge origin judging from the saint runes engraved on it.

Mentioning his dao artifact, Wu Mu had pride reflected on his face while he said to Lin Yun, “If you Dragon-blooded Cat can wield it, I can give it to him for free.”

Wu Mu then plunged the Heavenly Demonic Dipper Staff onto the ground and the saint runes on it started enveloping the entire staff with a demonic aura. Lin Yun was initially thinking of warning Wu Mu not to look down on Lil’ Red. But when he saw this scene, he started frowning his brows.

The Heavenly Demonic Dipper Staff was truly weird because the saint runes engraved on it looked like they were linked to heaven and earth. So pulling it out wouldn’t be any lighter than moving an entire mountain. Furthermore, Lin Yun could sense a familiar aura similar to his sky sword intent.

Judging from this appearance, it looks like Wu Mu was really determined to obtain one-third of the Gold-furred Demonic Ape’s bloodline and wanted Lil’ Red to take a step back. At that time, Lin Yun would have no choice but to agree to his suggestion. Then again, Lin Yun also wouldn’t suffer a loss since he could get the Demonic Constellation Realm to help him once.

But just when Lin Yun was in deep thoughts, Lil’ Red had already stepped forth and grabbed onto the Heavenly Demonic Dipper Staff. Before everyone could react, Lil’ Red released a roar and pulled the staff off the ground. This instantly caused lightning to rumble in the sky with the entire valley starting trembling.

In the next moment, the Heavenly Demonic Dipper Staff shone brightly with a flash of golden brilliance. Even the demonic aura enveloping the staff earlier had disappeared as the saint runes shone with an unprecedented brilliance as if there were golden blood flowing on the staff.

At the same time, Lil’ Red’s tiny figure also started spinning as it held onto the Heavenly Demonic Dipper Staff with the image of a majestic dracoape appearing behind it which made the entire heaven and earth start trembling violently.

This scene had caused Lin Yun and Wu Mu’s faces to change as they quickly retreated. When everyone settled down, everyone from the Demonic Constellation Realm was completely dumbfounded.

“H-how is this possible…” Wu Mu was naturally the one who was most shocked. At this moment, he deeply regretted his action. Not only did this Dragon-blooded Cat pull out the Heavenly Demonic Dipper Staff, but it actually unleashed the full power of the demonic dipper metal. This was simply a scene of legend.

In their clan, it had been thousands of years since someone was capable of unleashing the full power of the demonic dipper metal. Right at this moment, the other geniuses from the Demonic Constellation Realm went down on their knees and kowtowed when the dracoape image behind Lil’ Red gradually cleared up.

“Ancient Dracoape!” Wu Mu was also shocked before he immediately went down on his knees and kowtowed as well.
