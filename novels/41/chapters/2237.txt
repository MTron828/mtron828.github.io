Chapter 2238 - Hold It!

On this broken, barren land, a sword ray soared to the sky as Lin Yun hovered in the hair with his hair fluttering in the wind. His gaze fell onto Kui’erkong, and his gaze was cold.

Kui’erkong and Kui’ertuo were shocked. Unlike Kui’erdo, they were at their prime, and they couldn’t believe that a Quasi-Saint managed to block an attack that was released by a second-stage Saint Lord while using a secret treasure.

Kui’erkong coldly said, “It looks like we have underestimated you. You're too naive if you think this is a pitiful trick. Die!”

The Spiritual Ghost Flag in his hand was tossed at Lin Yun like a spear when he finished speaking. The Spiritual Ghost Flag was already about to shatter, so he pushed the energy fluctuation from the flag to the peak. But after this strike, the Spiritual Ghost Flag would be destroyed.

Lin Yun seemed to have predicted this and quickly dodged the flag’s impact.

The Spiritual Ghost Flag expanded and a terrifying black vortex appeared, looking like a black hole that could devour everything. Inside the black hole were all kinds of resentment spirits releasing powerful saint auras.

This evil secret technique used the Spiritual Ghost Flag as the price, and even a third-stage Saint Lord would die if they were hit by it. Kui’erkong’s heart was aching since he had to use this to deal with Lin Yun. But the Spiritual Ghost Flag was already on the verge of breaking, so he might as well use it one last time.

But when the Spiritual Ghost Flag exploded, Lin Yun turned into a golden streak of light and flew out. When he briefly paused in the air, ripples spread beneath his feet as he dashed forth even faster, charging at Kui’erkong.

“H-How is this possible?” Kui’erkong’s face changed. He didn’t expect a Quasi-Saint to be so fast, even faster than him.

“Firefly’s Radiance!” Lin Yun held onto the Flower Burial Sword and drew a circle with afterimages flying from his body. As ten-odd sword rays formed into a circle, he unleashed a sword ray that reached a hundred feet, flying out.

Kui’erkong quickly made a move and threw a punch out. When his fist clashed with the sword ray, the two energies were evenly matched, with a powerful shockwave sweeping around.

“How did this fellow manage to fight Kui’erkong evenly?” Kui’ertuo was surprised as he watched this scene.

This was a frontal confrontation, but no one could do a thing to the other party despite the huge difference in their cultivation. Kui’erkong and Kui’ertuo wondered if Lin Yun really was only at the Quasi-Saint Realm.

“Get lost!” Kui’erkong was furious and pushed his other palm forth, pouring his saint energy into his palm. His brows were knitted together because he couldn’t figure out how Lin Yun was evenly matched with him.

“That sword… Something’s not right about it…” Kui’erkong was horrified to discover that the sword in Lin Yun’s hand was terrifying, and the palm he created with saint energy was slowly being pierced.

Kui’erkong immediately knew that something wasn’t right. If Lin Yun managed to get close to him, the consequences would become dire in addition to Lin Yun’s sword intent. This made Kui’erkong plunge into fear as the flow of saint energy within his body was messed up, completely suppressed by Lin Yun’s sword aura.

The saint energy in Kui’erkong’s palm exploded as a sword ray flew over. He relied on instincts to dodge, and the sword ray brushed past his face. As a few strands of hair fell, Kui’erkong’s face was nervously pale. “That was dangerous.”

But when he said that, a cut appeared on his cheek, and his dipper aura was destroyed. After the cut, half of Kui’erkong’s face exploded as he screamed. He was furious, with fear and rage on his face.

“Move!” In the critical moment, Kui’ertuo moved as he reached out with a grasp, brushing past Lin Yun, and his claw shattered the air in his path.

“Kill him!” Kui’erkong’s face soon recovered with anger blazing in his eyes, and he mustered his full strength.

In the next moment, he no longer held back, pushing his dipper aura to the limit with his vertical eye-opening. He joined forces with Kui’ertuo and they sandwiched Lin Yun, especially since they were pinnacle second-stage Saint Lords and equivalent to over ten Horizon Hawk Saint Lords.

As golden light flashed within Lin Yun’s eyes, he circulated his Quasi-Divine Light Sword Intent with his Sword Dao blooming. The two sword canons were activated and fused with his Flower Burial Sword.

“Die!” Lin Yun ignored Kui’ertuo’s attack and charged at Kui’erkong.

“Great!” Kui’erkong’s eyes lit up as he began to laugh. In his eyes, what Lin Yun did was no different from courting death. If Lin Yun took Kui’ertuo’s attack head-on, he would be ripped into pieces since the latter executed the Netherghost Claw.

This attack might seem insignificant, but it could easily tear a second-stage Saint Lord apart, and no Quasi-Saints could withstand it. So Kui’erkong only had to withstand this attack. At that time, even if this sword was powerful, he would only be heavily injured at best, and the injuries were nothing to Demonspirits as long as they weren’t dead. They could swiftly recover from their wounds.

“You’re dead!” Kui’erkong laughed as demonic radiance shone on him with a huge palm descending. But when the black palm came in contact with the sword, it was swiftly destroyed by the Flower Burial Sword.

Kui’erkong had expected this scene as he clasped his hands together, firmly clamping onto the Flower Burial Sword.

“Brat, you’re still too young,” Kui’erkong wore a smug face as he coldly looked at Lin Yun, pouring his saint energy into his hands.

“Who gave you the courage to catch my sword?” Lin Yun no longer held back and activated the four glory spirits in the Flower Burial Sword.

Kui’erkong’s smug look on his face was short-lived as Lin Yun’s Sword Dao and Quasi-Divine Light Sword Intent ripped his hands to pieces. While he still couldn’t comprehend what Lin Yun meant, he had already lost his arms with his blood gushing down.Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“My hands…” Kui’erkong screamed as he turned around and fled, but Lin Yun shook his wrist as the Flower Burial Sword fell onto Kui’erkong’s neck.

That wasn’t all, Lin Yun flicked his finger, unleashing a sword ray at the latter’s vertical eye, executing the Flicking Divine Finger, completely killing his enemy. Everything happened too quickly. Kui’ertuo’s Netherghost Claw then reached him at this moment, which Lin Yun took a full blow with his back.

Kui’ertuo’s claw stabbed into Lin Yun’s flesh. But just when he wanted to crush Lin Yun’s ribs and grab his heart, Kui’ertuo was shocked to discover that Lin Yun’s bones were tough, like a saint artifact. Not only were his claw unable to rip Lin Yun into two pieces, he couldn’t even crush Lin Yun’s heart.

Lin Yun’s face twitched, but he maintained his composure as he let go of the Flower Burial Sword, which aimed for Kui’ertuo’s temple from a tricky angle.

This made Kui’ertuo shocked as he quickly pulled out his hand and retreated.

Lin Yun turned around and grabbed the Flower Burial Sword. A chant that felt like it had traveled through time could be heard, and Lin Yun unleashed a sword ray that flew towards Kui’ertuo.

The sword intent immediately injured Kui’ertuo as he retreated, but he couldn’t dodge the sword intent. The sword ray was like a rapid river, and the sword aura reached the limit after traveling for a few thousand meters.

Kui’ertuo couldn’t escape and was struck by this sword ray, throwing out a mouthful of blood, and was sent a hundred meters away before he fell to the ground onto one knee. He threw out blood as he raised his head and saw a swordsman hovering in the sky with his clothes and hair fluttering in the wind.

“This is Flower Burial?” Kui’ertuo was shocked because he felt he had offended someone he shouldn’t have. He shouldn’t have come; only the Ying River King could handle this person. But that didn’t mean he had lost!

Looking at the approaching Lin Yun, Kui’ertuo wiped the blood off his lips and coldly said, “Flower Burial, it looks like you want to stand against my Spirit Clan!”

“I’m fearless.” Lin Yun approached as his Quasi-Divine Light Sword Intent roared.

“Don’t think that you’ve won! The game has just started!” Kui’ertuo slammed his palm on the ground as the nearby demonic corpses charged at Lin Yun. The saint aura released by the demonic corpses reached a terrifying height, making Lin Yun squint his eyes because he nearly forgot about the demonic corpses.

He frowned, and he was surprised when the demonic corpses came over. The demonic corpses were giving off saint aura, but their movements were stiff without saint origin or saint constellation, looking like killing puppets without any spirituality in their eyes.

This was different from what he had imagined. He initially wanted to flee, but he hesitated and allowed himself to be surrounded by the demonic corpses and played with them. Initially, the demonic corpses looked terrifying with their numbers, but Lin Yun relaxed after he held his ground. Relying on his sword intent, the demonic corpses couldn’t even touch him.

“I see…” Lin Yun closed his eyes and let the demonic corpses charge at him.

“What’s going on?” Kui’ertuo had a bad feeling about this.

When Lin Yun opened his eyes, his sword intent was like ink spread out as Lin Yun executed the Heaven Sword Form. As thirty-six layers of pressure came crashing down, the demonic corpses were entirely suppressed. When the ‘Heaven’ word was formed, all the demonic corpses were ripped into pieces with one sword.

“They’re just empty corpses. It might be effective against others, but it’s nothing to me,” Lin Yun held his sword as he slowly approached.

Kui’ertuo felt so much despair that his jaw nearly fell off. He no longer had any hesitation and fled for his life.

But Lin Yun didn’t look at him as he sheathed his sword. When a dragon roar echoed, the Quasi-Divine Light Sword Intent that had remained within Kui’ertuo’s body erupted like spears piercing out of his body, turning the latter into a hedgehog.

“Mhm?” When he was about to leave, Lin Yun suddenly felt a terrifying aura approaching. There was a crimson cloud approaching from afar.

“Flower Burial, hold it!”

The already despaired Kui’ertuo rejoiced and yelled, “Ying River King, save me!”

Lin Yun ignored Kui’ertuo and turned to look into the distance. Over there, there was a figure enveloped in a saint radiance that was like the arrival of a bright moon, releasing a crimson radiance that formed into a terrifying phenomenon.
