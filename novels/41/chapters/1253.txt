Chapter 1254 - Refining Dragon Origin Pellet

Lil’ Purple’s mouth was too vicious, and Lin Yun didn’t want to see her at this moment. Since there was still half a month until the Profound Wither Island opens, Lin Yun knew that he couldn’t waste his time and had to push himself to his limit.

With half a month left, he could only temper his astral energy and Divine Solar Lunar Fist. It was impossible for him to refine astral energy through ordinary divine astral pellets since he still hadn’t manifested his astral energy. But Lin Yun had two dragon origin pellets, and it was also time for him to start the next section of the Divine Solar Lunar Fist.

After listening to what Ye Ziling said, Lin Yun realized that he had underestimated the dangers that he would have to face on the Profound Wither Island. After all, those powerful sects could get Lesser Elysium Core Realm and Greater Elysium Core Realm into the Profound Wither Island, not to mention the Elysium Core Realm deacons were stronger than ordinary experts of the same generation.

Those in the Lesser Elysium Core Realm were still alright, but only death awaited him if he faced an expert in the Greater Elysium Core Realm. Just thinking about it made Lin Yun’s scalp feel numb. He knew that he had to prepare some trump cards or he wouldn’t even know how he would die.

“But risks and opportunities always coexist. If it’s that dangerous, that means that the opportunities will also be great.” Lin Yun muttered and placed the sword box on the ground before circulating his astral energy. As he formed the Sky Unlocking Seal, a powerful suction force exploded from the sword box that pulled him in.

After appearing on the desolate world within the sword box, Lin Yun sat on the jade bed that was not far from the Phoenix Tree. Then again, the jade bed had long lost its effects a long time ago.

When Lin Yun swept his gaze over this world that should’ve been a holy land, he saw that there were no signs of life in this world.

There used to be a Phoenix Tree at the center, a jade bamboo forest in the east, a lighting tribulation pool and purgatory in the south; then add the fact that the jade bed he was on was located in the north. Not to mention a sword mound was in the west with all the swords belonging to a saint. Aside from that, there was also the Hidden Weapon Pavilion with all sorts of divine artifacts and treasures in it. But what captivated his attention the most was the throne.

Not to mention the seven dao intents that filled this world. There were no benefits in going into seclusion here, except that no one would know regardless of the commotion he would create.

“Mhm?” Suddenly, Lin Yun’s eyes lit up when he discovered something. Based on the elements of the location in this holy land, the east represented wood, the west represented metal, the north represented water, and the south represented fire. As for the Phoenix Tree that was located in the center, it naturally represented earth. This meant that all five elements that corresponded with the four ancient constellations could be found in this world; the azure dragon, vermillion bird, black tortoise, and white tiger.

Lin Yun knew that back in ancient times, the azure dragon’s position as one of the four constellations used to be the Blue Dragon, but he had no idea why the azure dragon replaced it as the divine beast of the east.

“The four ancient constellations along with a primordial ice phoenix. This is interesting. There are five elements now, so where’s yin and yang?” Lin Yun wondered. This world was profound, and there were many secrets for him to discover. But it was too hard for him to gather all the Sovereign Divine Runes. Even if he managed to find them, it wasn’t certain that he could restore this secret realm back to how it once was.

After all, Lin Yun knew that Lil’ Purple’s words couldn’t be completely trusted. He knew that Lil’ Purple definitely had her own thoughts about finding the Sovereign Divine Runes.

Sitting on the jade ice bed, Lin Yun waved his hand and retrieved a jade box from his interspatial pouch. When he opened the box, boundless origin energy spread out in the form of a mist, and he could even hear draconic roars coming from the mist. When the mist cleared up, Lin Yun finally saw white pellets sitting within the box. These were the dragon origin pellets that Feng Jue gave him.

The dragon origin pellet was something that not even Samsara Edict Realm experts could acquire in bulk. After all, it was something that had to be personally refined by saints. According to Jian Jingtian, even a Dragon Pulse Realm expert would be blown to death if he or she wasn’t careful.

“With the Azure Dragon Saint Physique, my physique isn’t any weaker than a thousand-rune saint artifact right now. Even an expert in the Dragon Pulse Realm might not have a stronger physique than me.”

Lin Yun looked at the dragon origin pellet and took a deep breath before he wore a decisive expression. Reaching out, Lin Yun took the dragon origin pellet and circulated the Azure Dragon Saint Art before he began to refine this dragon origin pellet. A draconic roar was echoing from within his body.

But the refining speed was a lot slower than Lin Yun had expected. He only managed to refine a small wisp of it even after an hour. But when the dragon origin energy poured into his body, it immediately coursed through his body like a boiling current. The next second, a crimson fog immediately appeared on the surface of his body. Just this wisp of dragon origin energy alone had already caused such a huge impact to him.

After taking a deep breath, Lin Yun quickly activated the Azure Dragon Mark on his chest and the saint rune within the mark began to ignite. As dragon runes appeared on the surface of his body, they immediately fortified Lin Yun’s body, which was about to blow apart.

When the blood mist dissipated, the violent impact within his body finally started to settle down. This made Lin Yun take in a deep breath, but he didn’t dare to relax and controlled the dragon origin energy into the astral river in his violet palace.

When the dragon origin energy entered, the astral river in his body began to gradually grow from a small stream into a huge river. As Lin Yun continued to refine the dragon origin energy, the impurities within his astral energy were being released from his pores, forming a multi-colored mist. But this was actually the impurities and toxins that were contained within his astral energy.

While Lin Yun was refining the dragon origin pellet, Mu Qingqing and the Sword Sect’s party also returned to their residence.

When they settled down, Zhang Ting complained, “Senior Sister Mu, aren’t we a little too polite to the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect?”

Qin Tian was silently standing to the side with his cheek still swollen. After hearing Zhang Ting’s words, the other Sword Sect disciples also turned to look at Mu Qingqing. They have long heard that there was a huge opportunity in the Sword Saint Mountain, and even if they couldn't obtain the opportunity, they still wanted to give the Thirteen Trials a try.

They initially thought that they could do anything they wanted since they were from the Sword Sect. But today, they were greatly embarrassed, so there was no way they could take this lying down.

Looking at them, Mu Qingqing revealed a faint smile. “The Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect isn’t the same as the other branch sects. The sect master clearly doesn’t want to see us, so there’s no need for us to seek humiliation. After all, he’s…”

But Mu Qingqing stopped halfway and didn’t continue. But when Zhang Ting heard that, he unhappily said, “What’s so impressive about them? They’re still stuck in a countryside like the Profound Azure Prefecture.”

“Is that so?” Mu Qingqing wore a mocking expression and said, “Then did you guys know that Ye Ziling, who was together with me today, is a direct descendant of an Ancient Saint Clan?”

The words ‘Ancient Saint Clan’ made the faces of Sword Sect disciples change. They didn’t mishear Mu Qingqing say “Ancient Saint Clan” and not “Saint Clan”. There was a huge difference between the two.

If a clan produced a saint, they could be called a Saint Clan. But Ancient Saint Clans were saint clans that remained through the darkest era, and every single one of them was a colossal figure in the Kunlun Realm. They were comparable to powerful sects, and some Ancient Saint Clans could even be comparable to a holy land.

There were only a handful of Ancient Saint Clans in the Eastern Desolation. As for the Ancient Barren Domain, they were even rarer. But Ancient Saint Clans usually kept a low profile and rarely interfered in the conflicts between powerful sects, not to mention that they had a complicated relationship with the Divine Dragon Empire.

After all, the Divine Dragon Empire rose with the annihilation of many Ancient Saint Clans, and the Ancient Saint Clans that remained after the rise of the Divine Dragon Empire all possessed unimaginable foundations.

“She’s from an Ancient Saint Clan? No wonder she makes such a huge impression,” said Qin Tian.

Mu Qingqing took a glance at Qin Tian. Looking at his swollen face, Mu Qingqing couldn’t help frowning and said, “The wound on your face is merely a superficial wound. With your strength, you should have been able to recover from it a long time ago.”

“Please don’t misunderstand, Senior Sister. I’m not in a hurry to recover not because I’m holding a grudge, but because I want to remember this lesson well. If I wanted to take revenge against him, do you think he’d still be alive with my strength?” Qin Tian replied.

Hearing that, only then did Mu Qingqing feel relieved.

Qin Tian then wore a prideful expression and said, “Senior Brother Sikong Zhou is my objective, not Lin Yun. There’s no way he can catch up to my future achievements. But his slap did give me a wake-up call. Even an ant cannot be underestimated, and it’s worth it to buy a lesson with a slap before going to Profound Wither Island.”

His words made the other disciples of the Sword Sect move. They were all filled with admiration for Qin Tian at this moment. Then again, what Qin Tian said also made sense since he was destined to be someone that Lin Yun would never be able to catch up to. When Zhang Ting looked at Qin Tian again, his eyes were filled with respect.

“Speaking of which, when’s Senior Brother coming?” Qin Tian asked.

Mu Qingqing replied, “I’m not sure about that. He and some transcendent geniuses are all looking for the Profound Wither Key. I heard that this key fell into the hands of Flower Burial, but no one has an idea about Flower Burial’s true identity.”
