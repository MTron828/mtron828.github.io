Chapter 2173: Great Profound Sword Canon

Within the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion, Mu Xueling looked at the trembling string with surprise on her face. Although all daos were connected together in the end, Tian Xuanzi had shocked her by playing the Imperial Tune. As long as someone grasps the Imperial Tune, one would be able to confront Saint Realm experts by only relying on their music accomplishment.

The Imperial Tune had three realms, and the highest realm could confront Great Saints. This meant that Tian Xuanzi wasn’t simple.

“Saint Elder, what’s going on?” A figure came. This was the pavilion master of the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion. She might be the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s pavilion master, but her status was beneath Mu Xueling. The Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion was only a branch of the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain, and there was no way it could compare to the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain.

“Tian Xuanzi came and snatched the Heavenly Dragon’s blood,” Mu Xueling said. Her facial expression was calm without any ripples.

The Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s pavilion master was shocked as she looked at Mu Xueling. “I-Isn’t he a little too bold?”

Mu Xueling said, “No need to worry. It should be an instruction from that official, thinking that she could flatter her master this way. But she made a grave mistake.”

Back during the Blue Dragon Record, that official had been hinting to give the Heavenly Dragon’s blood to the Empress. But Mu Xueling ignored her and decided to give it to Lin Yun instead. At that time, that official was so furious that her face became red.

She must’ve gone to look for Tian Xuanzi along the way. According to her knowledge, Tian Xuanzi’s objective should be the Myriad Thunder Sect, and what he said in the end was absolute rubbish. The moment he said that, Mu Xueling already knew that he wasn’t taking it for himself.

“So you let him take it just like that?” The Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s pavilion master asked.

“Don’t worry about it. Her master will make her return it, and she will also be in trouble,” Mu Xueling said coldly. It was rare to see Mu Xueling so furious. She wasn’t that furious when she was against Tian Xuanzi, but she couldn’t bear it upon knowing that it was that female official who was behind it.

Heavenly Dao Sect’s Heavenly Wheel Pagoda

After Lin Yun managed to manifest the Wind Dao, he smoothly grasped the Thunder Dao. Thereafter, he also managed to grasp multiple Lesser Daos such as Speed Dao, Falling Leaf Dao, Fleeting Cloud Dao, and various other Lesser Daos. There were multiple smaller dao flowers hovering around the two bigger dao flowers.

Anyone could tell from the aura of the two bigger dao flowers that they were stronger than the flowers manifested by lesser daos. After grasping ten-odd Lesser Daos, Lin Yun opened his eyes and the surrounding thirty-six pagodas became dim.

“Not bad, Junior Brother. Although I manifested my daos for you, it's impressive that you managed to grasp the Wind and Thunder Daos in your first attempt,” Ye Guhan smiled opposite of Lin Yun. He wasn’t being polite but truly meant what he said. After all, many people might not even be able to grasp a Greater Dao in their lifetime, but Lin Yun easily grasped two. As for Lesser Daos, there were eighteen of them, and this was an unfathomable number.

“Senior Brother, when can I start to comprehend Sword Dao?” Lin Yun asked.

After grasping saint daos, Lin Yun’s strength had undergone a qualitative transformation, but he was most concerned about the Sword Dao now. After all, the Sword Dao was one of the thirty-six Sovereign Saint Daos, and it was on a whole new level than the three thousand Greater Daos. Aside from that would be Nirvana Dao.

There were nine Eternal Daos, and one would be able to reach an unimaginable height if they could grasp one. But the Nirvana Dao was too difficult, so Lin Yun placed it behind Sword Dao.

“It’s fine as long as you grasp it before the second stage of the Heavenly Origin Phase, and you’ll grasp it sooner or later. So you don’t have to be in a hurry about it,” Ye Guhan said.

“The second stage?”

“That’s right. The Heavenly Origin Phase is the same as a lesser saint. The first stage is to manifest your sacred flame, obtaining thirty-six layers of pressure that represent heaven. The second stage is to temper your saint soul, fusing all your saint dao into your soul. But the soul can only contain three saint dao, so you have to think this through. The third stage is the saint constellation, which turns your constellation into a saint constellation. The moment the saint constellation is formed, your constellation will undergo a transformation,” Ye Guhan said. “The Sacred Flame, Saint Soul, and Saint Constellation. After achieving all of them, you will reach the Saint Realm, and your sacred flame will become your saint origin. At that time, you will have a thousand years of lifespan.”

Lin Yun sighed, “My cultivation speed is too slow, and I don’t know when I can reach the Saint Realm.”

Hearing what Lin Yun said, Ye Guhan smiled, “You’re only twenty-six this year, and yet you find your cultivation speed slow? Not to mention that you have even grasped the pinnacle Astral Sword Intent, and you can fight those with a higher cultivation than you. Back in my time, we couldn’t even imagine cultivating as fast as you.”

“That might be the case, but Tian Xuanzi gave me too much pressure,” Lin Yun said.

Knocking on Lin Yun’s head, Ye Guhan smiled, “What are you thinking of? If we have to rely on you to deal with Tian Xuanzi, we might as well die.”

“Ouch!” Lin Yun rubbed his head because it really hurts this time.

“Alright, it doesn’t hurt anymore.” Ye Guhan caressed Lin Yun’s head dotingly while smiling, “You’re a genius, and Tian Xuanzi is also a genius. He’s a few hundred years older than you, and the resources he received are unimaginable. He also has a special background.” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“How special?” Lin Yun asked. He had been curious about that for a long time.

“Him…?” Ye Guhan paused, before he sighed, “He seems to have come from heaven. His appearance, talent, aptitude, and comprehension are flawless. He’s so flawless that he doesn’t look realistic. Master wanted to take him in as a disciple back then, but he sighed and gave up after knowing Tian Xuanzi’s background. After that, he no longer mentioned it again.”

Lin Yun knew about that because he could tell from their conversation back then that the Radiant Sword Saint had helped Tian Xuanzi. This was why Lin Yun hated Tian Xuanzi so much. The Radiant Sword Saint clearly helped him before, and yet Tian Xuanzi kept targeting the Sword Sect. Regardless of the devastation to the Sword Sect’s golden-generation or Jian Jingtian, they were all caused by Tian Xuanzi.

If it wasn’t because the Radiant Sword Saint was benevolent, there would have been multiple chances for him to take Tian Xuanzi’s life before the latter could grow up. But Tian Xuanzi had no gratitude for the Radiant Sword Saint. He wasn’t even worthy of being a human.

“What’s his background?” Lin Yun asked.

“I don’t know about that, either. Master never told it to anyone, and I’m afraid no one knows about it, aside from the Nine Emperors,” Ye Guhan said. He then continued, “I knew him for a few hundred years, but even I can’t guess his secret.”

“Senior Brother, you knew him in the past?” Lin Yun asked.

“Not only did I know him in the past,” Ye Guhan smiled. “We’re called the Twin Stars of the Eastern Desolation back then, and we’re a lot stronger than the two now. Our names spread far and wide throughout the entire Kunlun Realm.”

“But…” Ye Guhan sighed. “Ever since he joined the Profound Sky Sect, I couldn't see through him anymore. Gradually, I was no longer able to catch up to his cultivation, and the Twin Stars of the Eastern Desolation no longer existed back then. Only Tian Xuanzi’s name was spreading throughout the Kunlun Realm.”

Suddenly, Ye Guhan looked at Lin Yun, and smiled, “You’re him from five hundred years ago, also blessed with peerless talent. You’re the protagonist of this era, just as he was the protagonist of the era five hundred years ago…”

“It’s best not to put us together,” Lin Yun smiled awkwardly.

“Let’s not talk about it anymore. I’ll teach you the Great Profound Sword Canon,” Ye Guhan said. “The Great Profound Sword Canon is the strongest martial technique of the Sword Sect, but it is a pity that two of the Sword Sect’s peaks were levelled by Yu Qingfeng back then. As a result, the Great Profound Sword Canon is no longer complete. Otherwise, it would be a lot more powerful now.”

“Why is the sword canon no longer complete after losing two peaks? Does that mean that the sword canon will disappear if all seven peaks are gone?” Lin Yun asked.

“You’re not wrong about that. The Great Profound Sword Canon has nine stages in total, and each stage will double the strength of your sword intent. After reaching the ninth stage, your sword intent can multiply by ninefold,” Ye Guhan smiled bitterly.

Lin Yun widened his mouth upon hearing that. It was a little too unbelievable.

“You can manifest a sword with each level, such as the Divine Firmament Sword, Scarlet Firmament Sword, Profound Firmament Sword, Indigo Firmament Sword, and so on.”

Lin Yun’s eyes lit up as he said, “It corresponds with the nine peaks of the Sword Sect.”

“That’s right. So the nine peaks have to exist to cultivate it. For example, the existence of the Divine Firmament Peak can allow you to manifest the Divine Firmament Sword, and the Scarlet Firmament Peak is required to manifest the Scarlet Firmament Sword,” Ye Guhan explained.

“It’s really magical,” Lin Yun said as he fell into deep thoughts.

“Not exactly. You will manifest the swords within your body, and each sword contains different attributes. You can release them to fight, and the Great Profound Sword Canon is comprehensive, containing many sword techniques and secret techniques…” Ye Guhan carried on with his explanation, “There are legends that say that if someone can cultivate all nine stages, you will be able to reach the height of the Great Profound Nine Transformations. Which is to multiply the power of your sword intent more than nine times, ultimately reaching eighty-one times.”

Lin Yun could feel his scalp going numb as he listened to Ye Guhan’s explanation, since this was a little too terrifying.

“Are you frightened?” Ye Guhan smiled, “Otherwise, why do you think that the Sword Sect is capable of being the strongest sect for swordsmen within the Kunlun Realm?”

Lin Yun’s thoughts drifted as he recalled the oath he made when he first joined the Sword Sect, which was to bring the Sword Sect’s position back to a holy land.

“What are you thinking about? So, do you want to learn the Great Profound Sword Canon?” Ye Guhan smiled.

“Yes, I do.” Lin Yun nodded.

“Good. Focus on cultivating and put Tian Xuanzi aside for now,” Ye Guhan said.

“I got it, Senior Brother.” Although Lin Yun agreed, he wasn’t that convinced in his heart. If there was an opportunity, he would personally take Tian Xuanzi’s life and destroy the entire Profound Sky Sect.

“I will teach it to you now, but you have to make a Heavenly Dao Oath that you won’t teach it to others without our master’s permission,” Ye Guhan said seriously.
