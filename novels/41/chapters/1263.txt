Chapter 1264 - Jiao-Dragon Saint Tablet

Aside from Lan Kong, who was the strongest there, all the other Azure Thunder Sect’s disciples were dead. They came furiously wanting a bloodbath from the disciples of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. This even made everyone worried that there would be a bloodbath.

There was indeed a bloodbath, but no blood from the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect was shed. Instead, it was the blood of the disciples of the Azure Thunder Sect that was shed. Even Lan Kong, who managed to survive, had to flee because his opponents were too strong. He was only alive because Ye Ziling spared him.

When Lan Kong crawled out from the rubble, he immediately fled for his life without even turning back. The two women were too terrifying, and they naturally had huge origins. He could sense that Ye Ziling had an ancient bloodline that even made him afraid.

The audience members no longer dared to stay behind after being intimidated by Ye Ziling and Luo Hua’s strength, not to mention how brutal and ruthless they were, sending chills down their spines.

Just a moment ago, they were still submerged by Ye Ziling’s beauty and found it a pity if a beauty like her died. But now, they did not dare to have any thoughts and only wanted to leave this place quickly.

In the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s camp, Jiang Lichen and the rest didn’t utter a single word because they could sense that the surrounding atmosphere wasn’t right. So they could only alternate their gazes between Ye Ziling and Luo Hua.

They had a feeling that there seemed to be sparks flying between the two women’s eyes. After all, Luo Hua said to let Lan Kong leave, but Ye Ziling still attacked and heavily injured him. Then again, that seemed normal because they knew that Ye Ziling didn’t have any favorable opinion about Luo Hua.

But their senior sister was someone with self-restraint and would rarely speak so blatantly. This made them wonder if this was because of Lin Yun. After all, Lin Yun was ridiculously close to Luo Hua, as if they were a couple. Not to mention that anyone could tell that they had known each other for a long time.

This made them wonder if their senior sister was jealous. As their thoughts began to run wild, they actually came to a similar conclusion and this made them hold their breaths from the tensed atmosphere. They felt as if the two women would fight in the next moment.

“I’ll go ask around and see what’s going on.” Ye Ziling didn’t think too much about it and only wanted to know what Lin Yun did.

As for Luo Hua, she only glanced at Ye Ziling before she retracted her gaze. She was calm and wasn’t concerned with what kind of turbulence Lin Yun caused. Or rather, there was no need for her to be worried about him.

Very quickly, Ye Ziling returned with a piece of shocking news. It turned out that Lin Yun had a conflict with a disciple of the Azure Thunder Sect because of a Scarlet Blood Fruit. The other party threatened him with the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect and Lin Yun slew his opponent. Furthermore, Lin Yun even used two fingers to snap a saint artifact.

“Snapping a saint sword with two fingers!?”

“Junior Brother Lin is already so strong?” Jiang Lichen and the rest were shocked. They knew that Lin Yun had gotten even stronger, but they never imagined that he would become this strong in just one month.

“So, where’s he right now?” Jiang Lichen asked.

“He went for a quasi-saint elixir,” said Ye Ziling and glanced at Luo Hua when she spoke.

The night sky was charming in the Profound Wither Sea while being covered with bright stars. As Lin Yun landed on an island, the scale of this island might not be comparable to those occupied by powerful sects, but it was also massive, roughly at the scale of two Fleeting Cloud Sword Sects.

Furthermore, this wasn’t far from the Profound Wither Island. Looking at the rainbow light enveloping this island, Lin Yun appeared in a swamp. Due to the rainbow light, many of the tree branches’ growths were accelerated.

But the island was desolate, and the trees were distantly placed. When he landed on the ground, he could sense an eerie aura that enveloped the atmosphere with a boundless vitality. The vitality was massive and ancient, but it gave him a feeling that it was sealed in ice and was slowly awakening.

This made Lin Yun’s heart beat quickly. The Azure Dragon Saint Art had caught the smell of ‘food’ once again. This feeling made Lin Yun squint his eyes because it was the third time he had this feeling. The first time was the Blood Flame Dragon Gold Rune, the second was the divine dragon aura, and the third was the saint blood essence from the Nine Li Illusion Realm’s altar.

This time, it was the five thousand-year-old Dragon Blood Fruit. The past three times brought great benefits to him, allowing his Azure Dragon Saint Art to undergo a transformation. It looked like those guys didn’t lie to him and the value of this Dragon Blood Fruit was terrifying.

But none of them dared to get close to Lin Yun and only followed far behind him. This was because it would be convenient for them to run if anything happened. They might seem bold, but they were more cowardly than anyone else.

Lin Yun followed this aura and it didn’t take long for him to hear rumbling sounds ahead of him. Although the big sects have sealed off this island, the Dragon Blood Fruit still tempted many people who wanted to seize the opportunity on this island.

After all, a five thousand-year-old Dragon Blood Fruit was too terrifying. Even if they couldn’t obtain the Dragon Blood Fruit, it would be great if they could obtain an elixir that was born along with it.

“This island is sealed off! Aside from disciples from big sects, no one is allowed to ascend the mountain!”

“We’re already benevolent. Get lost or don’t blame me for being ruthless!”

“Disciples from the ten big sects do inform your arrival and avoid unnecessary conflicts.” Compared to those who descended onto the island, there weren’t many disciples from the big sects, but none of them were afraid. They would unleash their astral energy in mid-air and seal off the surroundings.

This made Lin Yun fall into deep thoughts because this was the ‘rapport’ between the big sects that the woman from the Azure Thunder Sect spoke about. Looks like they were planning to seal off all the quasi-saint elixirs before competing amongst themselves.

They were simply too overbearing, and this made Lin Yun shake his head before he continued forth. Suddenly, someone’s gaze fell onto Lin Yun. This was a black-clothed youth who was enveloped with flames, wielding a saint artifact. His saint artifact was a stone tablet that had a remnant soul of a jiao-dragon sealed within it.

Upon unleashing it, he could summon a flaming dragon. He was very strong, and just him alone was equivalent to a few hundred people. When the black-clothed youth’s gaze fell onto Lin Yun, he activated the tablet in his hand, and a flaming jiao-dragon charged towards Lin Yun.

Lin Yun didn’t say a word and soared into the sky, clashing head-on. He used his physique to confront the flaming jiao-dragon before raising his palm and pushing it against the black-clothed youth’s face. This made the black-clothed youth scream out in pain with blood bleeding from his seven orifices, but he didn’t die from that.

“Oh?” Lin Yun was surprised because it was rare to see someone who hasn’t died after taking his attack head-on in the face. Executing his movement technique, Lin Yun spread his arms apart and soared into the sky like a golden crow. Every single step he took would cause a rumble in the air, proving that each of his footsteps could easily kill an Empyrean.

As flames flew out from the tablet once more, it manifested into a jiao-dragon coiling around the black-clothed youth.

“Who the hell are you? How dare you…!” The black-clothed youth flew into rage but the flaming jiao-dragon around him was instantly destroyed. When Lin Yun pushed his palm out, dragon runes accompanied by a thunderstorm began to surge on the surface of his body. This instantly left half the black-clothed youth’s body charred.

“You…” The black-clothed youth was both shocked and terrified. But looking at the aura being emitted from Lin Yun, the black-clothed youth’s words immediately changed, “This is a misunderstanding! You must be from a big sect, right? You can just enter after telling me your identity. There’s no point for us to start a conflict, and we only stop those ants from trying to fish for benefits.”

“Who’s together with you?” Lin Yun replied indifferently. He didn’t have a background from a big sect. Even if he did, he wouldn’t want to stand together with these people, not to mention that Lin Yun didn’t like how these people from the big sects acted. If he was weaker, then he would’ve fallen like cannon fodder.

“Brother, I’m a disciple from the Flame Dragon Sect, this is a misunderstanding!” The black-clothed youth squeezed out a smile but he was sending messages to the other martial brothers. At the same time, he also had killing intent brewing in the depth of his pupils. He had roughly guessed that Lin Yun might not be a disciple of a big sect, and people like him were someone that they had to be cautious with.

Others could only fish for benefits at most, but there was a high possibility that people like Lin Yun could snatch the Dragon Blood Fruit. So this was why the big sects joined hands together and formed a rapport to reduce that possibility to the lowest. They also had an agreement that the one who obtained the quasi-saint elixir wouldn’t be allowed to participate again if another appeared.

This meant that everyone could practically obtain a quasi-saint elixir. When those following behind Lin Yun heard where the black-clothed youth came from, they were shocked and quickly pulled back even more. The Flame Dragon Sect was a terrifying sect and wasn’t any weaker than the Azure Thunder Sect. They had an ancient inheritance, and it was said that they had a several thousand-year-old Flame Jiao-Dragon in their sect.

“The Flame Dragon Sect?” Lin Yun muttered.

“That’s right. I’m from the Flame Dragon Sect…” The black-clothed youth said with joy on his face.

“I don’t know the Flame Dragon Sect.” Lin Yun stepped forth and eight hundred dragon runes gathered towards his palm. When he pushed his palm out, the black-clothed youth threw out a mouthful of blood before he was torn to pieces.

This scene left everyone terrified and quickly dispersed after they recovered from their shock. Lin Yun waved his hand and summoned the tablet into his hand. He first erased the mark in it before imprinting it with his mark. After he was done, he was shocked when he took a look at it.

The heart of the tablet actually had a droplet of a jiao-dragon’s blood. The blood was violent, looking like a flaming ocean. The more Lin Yun looked at it, the more shocked he was because the saint runes imprinted in the blood had fused perfectly together.

“The owner of this blood is definitely a terrifying monster.” Lin Yun was shocked because this jiao-dragon might be in the Saint Realm, and there was a high possibility that it was in the Great Saint Realm. It was no wonder why the black-clothed youth could take his first attack head-on and didn’t die. So it was due to this tablet.

“Am I a little too shocked? So it’s still because my experience is lacking…” Lin Yun inwardly muttered. He didn’t expect that he would obtain such a terrifying saint artifact after casually killing someone. Could that be the terrifying foundation of this Flame Dragon Sect?

If the black-clothed youth could bring out one-third of this tablet’s power, it would be tough for Lin Yun to kill him. But he soon tossed it to the back of his mind because this tablet now belonged to him.

Holding onto the tablet, lightning exploded around him as Lin Yun charged forth. Since the black-clothed youth’s death was abrupt, everyone was only able to recover from their shock after a long time had passed.

“Pei Cheng is dead!”

“Oh my god! That fellow died? Didn’t his senior brother give him the Jiao-Dragon Saint Tablet?” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Holy shit, the west gate will explode!” The faces of the big sect’s disciples were ugly because they knew that a strong opponent had intruded their territory. But when they raised their heads, they could only see a blurred flicker of lightning and it was already too late for them to catch up.
