Chapter 1942 - Empress In Danger

Lin Yun took out the Divine Sunchasing Art within the Three-Lives Realm and began comprehending it. He would separate his remaining time into four portions. He would spend six hours comprehending the Divine Sunchasing Art and refining the Golden Crow’s saint blood, six hours practicing the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra, and six hours on the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon and Nirvana Pellets to strengthen his cultivation, and six hours on the last three sword forms of the Divine Firefly Sword and perfecting his Sword of the Beginning.

Three months passed in the blink of an eye, and Lin Yun mastered the eleventh and twelfth sword forms of the Divine Firefly Sword. With that, he was one sword form away from mastering the full Divine Firefly Sword.

It would be impressive if many in the pinnacle Nirvana Stage experts could master seven to eight sword forms, but Lin Yun mastered all twelve before reaching the Nirvana Stage.

Another two months passed in the blink of an eye, and Lin Yun reached the pinnacle sixth channel of the Profound Death Stage. The dragon origin within his violet palace also reached a terrifying height.

“My progress is faster than I thought. I only used five months to reach the pinnacle sixth channel of the Profound Death Stage.” Lin Yun took a deep breath with a flash of decisiveness running through his pupils. He was 60% confident that he could make a breakthrough or wait up to half a year with a higher chance of making a breakthrough.

“Let’s go for it.” It was already worth a gamble since there were 60% odds of success. Lin Yun had always been decisive, and he wouldn’t hesitate when he decided. The Profound Death Channel had seven channels, and the seventh channel was dangerous because above it would be the Nirvana Stage.

Lin Yun closed his eyes and circulated the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon. As a heavenly dragon and divine phoenix appeared, the surrounding Nirvana Pellets were crushed, and a densely packed nirvana aura poured into his body. Each impact from this nirvana aura would make his body tremble, and he could sense an impact through his internal organs.

No one would do something like this because the risk was significant and painful. Over two hundred attempts later, Lin Yun opened his eyes and threw a mouthful of blood. He wiped the blood off his lips and noticed that his hands were trembling.

“Let’s slow down a little.” Lin Yun sighed and circulated the Blue Dragon Bone to treat his injuries. But his face was still pale because the injuries to his soul were still around.ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

But he didn’t rest for long and closed his eyes to continue making a breakthrough. He couldn’t rest for long, or all his effort would go down the drain.

Half a day later, the bottleneck to the seventh channel finally loosened up, and he was covered in blood. This was a domineering method, and it would cause significant harm to his physique. If he wasn’t careful, his cultivation would fall. But Lin Yun gritted his teeth and relied on his willpower as a swordsman to persevere.

Seven days later, Lin Yun was halfway through the last channel, and the profound death aura was seeping out from the last channel, coursing through his meridians. The pain made Lin Yun numb, and the ground was covered in blood as he endured unimaginable pain.

“Carry on!” Lin Yun’s eyes became bloodshot as he gritted his teeth. He wanted to give up several times but persevered, thinking that his master was running out of lifespan and Tian Xuanzi, who wanted to rule the entire Eastern Desolation.

“Lin Yun, your master suffers while Tian Xuanzi is still alive. How can you give up?! Have you forgotten your master’s teachings? Have you forgotten how your master saved you back then?!”

There was a roar within his heart. He was suppressing the pain with insanity supporting him. Suddenly, the nirvana aura within the Three-Lives Realm began to rumble before it poured towards him. The nirvana aura coursed through his body, and ten dragon pulses were gathering within his violet palace.

The seven profound life and profound death channels were opened simultaneously, with the profound life and profound death auras gathering within his violet palace. With that, he finally reached the seventh channel of the Profound Death Stage.

He took a deep breath, and his injuries began to recover at a rapid speed. It hadn’t been easy for him to reach the seventh channel of the Profound Death Stage, but he had finally reached it. Sensing the profound death and profound life auras gathering within his violet palace, Lin Yun couldn’t help smiling.

When the profound death and profound life auras combine, his dragon origin would transform into nirvana aura. At that time, a new gate would be opened before him, but he wasn’t in a hurry because he knew he couldn’t rush it.

“I’ll spend my remaining time refining the Golden Crow’s feathers and the Divine Sunchasing Art!” Lin Yun spent nearly half a year within the Three-Lives Realm, but only a few days had passed in the outside world. He couldn’t go into seclusion for a long time, or it would make people suspicious, since many people were paying attention to him within the Heavenly Dao Sect.

Lil’ Purple was within the Nether Orchid Courtyard for seven days. She would practically appear at night. This place was massive as one of the three courtyards, with more disciples than the Indigo Thunder Peak.

But she wasn’t too concerned about it. Whenever she walked past the saint disciples, they would respond as though they didn’t see her. She had covered herself with a simple spiritual array that perfectly fused her with the surroundings.

As long as she was careful, even a Quasi-Saint wouldn’t be able to discover her. But there was also a flaw because she couldn’t make a move, or her identity would be revealed.

“It looks like I have to take a trip to the Celestial Pool.” Lil’ Purple turned to look at the southwest of the Nether Orchid Courtyard. Her face briefly changed before she decided, “I can’t rely on that scumbag, I can only rely on myself!”

No one was there since it was forbidden ground, and they would only let saint disciples in at a certain time. The foot of the mountain was covered with flowers, and the Nether Orchid Mountain was up ahead. “It smells really nice…”

The Celestial Pool was located at the waist of the mountain, and there was no one there, aside from two deacons at the foot of the mountain. Lil’ Purple closed her eyes and the purple and golden runes shone on her forehead before she reopened them.

“There’s a reaction!” Lil’ Purple nodded at Lil’ Red before entering the Nether Orchid Mountain behind the two deacons. On the other hand, Lil’ Red turned into a black ray of light and merged with the surrounding darkness.

“It’s really in the Celestial Pool!” Lil’ Purple became excited when she was getting close and increased her speed.

Half a cup of tea later, Lil’ Purple finally saw the legendary Celestial Pool. The air was covered in spiritual energy but couldn’t be considered spiritual energy because it was no different from saint aura. Within the fog covering the entire pool, a figure could be faintly seen sitting in it.

“There’s someone here?” Lil’ Purple briefly paused and hid behind a rock, carrying Lil’ Red back. When she took a peek, she couldn’t help smiling, “Isn’t this that scumbag’s maid?”

She was confident that the Solar Lunar Divine Rune was at the bottom of the Celestial Pool, so she wasn’t in a hurry. She had plenty of time to wait for Bai Shuying to leave before looking for the Solar Lunar Divine rune.

“I have finally found it. There’s nothing impressive about the Nether Orchid Courtyard after all.” Lil’ Purple smiled and occasionally nodded while looking at Bai Shuying in the fog. She commented, “Not bad.”

Suddenly, water splashes resounded as a robe flew over and covered Bai Shuying’s naked body. This scene made Lil’ Purple nod, “She’s really white.”

When Bai Shuying was done putting on her clothes, she fell into deep thought before turning to look in Lil’ Purple’s direction. But there was no one there aside from the rock.

“Even a Quasi-Saint can’t see me. You think you can see me?” Lil’ Purple smiled, and she looked straight at Bai Shuying fearlessly.

On the other hand, Bai Shuying furrowed her brow with her head covered in water. Lil’ Purple became nervous as she moved closer and didn’t dare to move. She even held her breath to forcibly maintain her composure. But fortunately, Bai Shuying merely glanced in puzzlement before she left, which made Lil’ Purple let out a breath of relief.

But before Lil’ Purple could react, Bai Shuying suddenly turned around and pushed a palm out, landing on Lil’ Purple’s chest. This made Lil’ Purple throw out a mouthful of blood before she was sent flying away.

When Lil’ Purple flew out, her figure appeared in mid-air. She was wearing the Silvermoon Mask when she appeared. She hovered in mid-air, clad in the moonlight, with her silver hair grown to her waist.

Bai Shuying coldly questioned, “Who the hell are you? How dare you intrude on the Nether Orchid Courtyard!”

“Haha. This empress has gone through various dangers, and the Nether Orchid Courtyard is nothing.” Lil’ Purple hovered in the air as her ethereal and mysterious voice resounded.

“Empress?” Bai Shuying became uncertain after hearing what Lil’ Purple said.

“I’m born before heaven, and I’m eighteen years old. Each year for an era,” Lil’ Purple's indifferent voice resounded.

“Who the hell are you?” Bai Shuying frowned.

“Haha, it’s fine to tell you. I’m the Divine Phoenix Clan’s Supreme Heavenly Slaughter Empress of Four Seas, Eight Barrens, 36 Heavens, and 72 Earths!” Lil’ Purple said and continued coldly, “Lass, move away, and I can grant you an opportunity. But I can only make you suffer if you insist on being stubborn!”

“Bullshit!” Bai Shuying didn’t believe what Lil’ Purple said and soared to the sky with a golden and silver radiance shining from her. At the same time, a terrifying aura spread out, with her pupils becoming silver and gold.

This scared Lil’ Purple, but a black figure appeared before her and clashed with Bai Shuying head-on. After an exchange, the black figure was sent flying away; it was a fat cat.

“A cat and a little girl?” Bai Shuying suddenly thought of something and said, “So Zhang Yue wasn’t lying. You’re the culprit!”

Her face was calm, but her pupils emitted a terrifying aura with a saint radiance being emitted from her. Lil’ Red immediately wanted to change into the Ancient Dracoape form to stop Bai Shuying and allow Lil’ Purple to leave.

Lil’ Purple was also alarmed, and she could sense an ancient aura that was sealed within Bai Shuying’s body. She carried Lil’ Red and hid her aura before she fled. “Run!”

As Bai Shuying’s gaze flickered, she retracted her saint aura. She wanted to see who else was there because Zhang Yue mentioned that there was a man besides a little girl and a cat, and that man was the mastermind. She really wanted to know who was so bold as to use her name to write such a lecherous poem.

Bai Shuying slowly followed behind Lil’ Purple and Lil’ Red, who were swiftly leaving the Nether Orchid Courtyard. She was surprised to discover that Lil’ Purple seemed familiar with the Nether Orchid Courtyard, and she didn’t alarm anyone in her way.

“What is she doing in the Nether Orchid Courtyard?” Bai Shuying became alert. But her face soon changed because Lil’ Purple and Lil’ Red were escaping towards Indigo Thunder Peak, instantly making her think of Ye Qingtian. When she thought of Ye Qingtian, a smear of disgust appeared on her face.

She was a fool to believe that Ye Qingtian had changed, only to be fooled by Ye Qingtian and Wang Muyan. She was calm when she heard that Ye Qingtian had become the champion of the Di Group, but her heart couldn’t help fluctuating when she saw Indigo Thunder Peak.

“What a pity…” Bai Shuying shook her head and muttered to herself. She planned on stopping Lil’ Purple and Lil’ Red before reaching Indigo Thunder Peak.

A golden radiance shone from Lin Yun’s back within the Three-Lives Realm as a golden pair of wings with a wingspan of ten feet appeared behind Lin Yun. Basking in the golden radiance, Lin Yun looked like a deity. But he suddenly opened his eyes, and his face changed, “Lil’ Purple!”

He could sense that Lil’ Purple was in danger, and he immediately left the Three-Lives Realm and grabbed the Flower Burial Sword before charging out.
