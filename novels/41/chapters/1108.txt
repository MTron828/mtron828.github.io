Chapter 1109 - Listen Well Then

Flute music drifted out from the sea of clouds with snowflakes falling down. Lin Yun was calm, but his face was full of disbelief. He couldn’t believe that this music was from Lil’ Purple, especially as her music made her look even more ethereal.

At this moment, she was the focus of attention in the entire world. Very quickly, Lin Yun could sense the Iris Sword Sutra circulating without his control along with the music. As the Iris Flower bloomed in his violet palace, indigo petals flew out from his body, which made the scenery even more beautiful.

In the end, Lin Yun closed his eyes and sat down while the Iris Sword Sutra circulated along with the music. When the Iris Flower bloomed within his body, waves of sword aura swept out of his body uncontrollably. His Iris Sword Sutra was displaying an unrivaled luster after being led by the music.

As the music continued, Lin Yun felt as though a whole new world had opened to him. It was a bizarre feeling. Then, the music notes played by Lil’ Purple were imprinted into his sword aura to display an unrivaled demeanor.

When the music came to an end, without realizing, Lin Yun was enveloped in a terrifying sword aura that manifested into an Ice Phoenix outside of his body. Lin Yun was deeply shocked as he had a whole new understanding of using the flute as a sword.

With the flute, the Iris Sword Sutra revealed a newfound complexity that left Lin Yun speechless. When he opened his eyes, he looked at Lil’ Purple and asked, “What song is this? Praise the Phoenix?”

Shaking her head, Lil’ Purple replied, “Praise the Phoenix is a part of the Dragon-Phoenix Sword Score. How can you possibly learn that with your current cultivation? This song is called Dancing Indigo Phoenix.”

“You created it? This song is absolutely brilliant, and it matches my Iris Sword Sutra well,” replied Lin Yun.

When Lin Yun said that, Lil’ Purple’s face became weird, “This was created by that brat, Iris Sword Saint. It’s just a beginner song, so there’s nothing impressive about it. Hmph, the Dragon-Phoenix Sword Score that I’m going to teach you is a genuine divine song!”

When Lin Yun heard that, he smiled awkwardly and became silent.

But Lil’ Purple became energetic and said, “But you’re right. This song matches your Iris Sword Sutra perfectly. Although it’s not comparable to Praise the Phoenix, it can allow you to wield the flute as a sword within a short period of time.”

“What exactly is wielding the flute as a sword?” Lin Yun asked curiously.

“It means combining the music and your sword intent perfectly. It will allow your music to manifest your sword intent while containing the intent of any sword technique. As long as your sword intent is strong enough, the intent displayed in the music will be even more terrifying,” replied Lil’ Purple with her head tilted to the side.

Is it that strong? Now that he looked at it again, the grades of the sword techniques that he learned in the past such as the Thunderclap Sword Art and Dustlight Sword Art weren’t high, but the intent contained in them was strong. This also meant that he could start using them again, which filled him with anticipation.

“After grasping this method, you’ll be able to use any sword technique you want. If the sword technique matches the music well, the power will far exceed your imagination.”

Lin Yun’s eyes lit up and said, “Just like the Divine Dragon Sword Score, Godly Phoenix Sword Score, and Dragon-Phoenix Sword Score?”

“Smart.” Lil’ Purple then continued, “Come. Stand behind me so I can teach you the Dancing Indigo Phoenix and the technique.” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Lin Yun listened to what she said and stood behind her.

“Put your hands over the flute like this,” said Lil’ Purple.

In the end, Lin Yun had no choice but to sit down and hold onto the flute from behind Lil’ Purple. Just like that, two pairs of hands, one tiny and one large, wielded the flute together. This also meant that their hands were touching each other.

Lil’ Purple wasn’t happy with it, so she turned around to glare at Lin Yun, “You’re not allowed to take advantage of me.”

When Lin Yun heard that, he scrunched his face. Just what is this brat thinking? Lin Yun wasn’t perverted to the point of being interested in a brat. But seeing how serious she was, he could only smile awkwardly and not defend himself.

“Hmph!” Lil’ Purple snorted and whipped her braids to slap Lin Yun’s face. Lin Yun was talented, so he quickly picked up the technique she was teaching him. So Lil’ Purple started to test Lin Yun.

Holding onto the flute, Lin Yun began to play it without any anxiety on his face. He circulated the Iris Sword Sutra and sword rays shined out of his body. At this moment, he looked gentle and sacred. When the flute music sounded out, snowflakes and indigo phoenixes began to soar in the surroundings.

Lil’ Purple was shocked as she watched Lin Yun’s sword sutra and music resonate together. As his fingers played the flute, his hair fluttered in the wind.

“Not bad.” Lil’ Purple praised softly. It was already impressive that Lin Yun could accomplish this when he just learned how to play the flute.Perhaps this young man before her really was a peerless genius when it came to sword dao. But Lil’ Purple shook her head because this was all thanks to her. She was a good teacher!.

When Lin Yun was done, he opened his eyes and asked, “How is it?”

“Not bad. There’s naturally no way you can compete with me. Plus, the Dancing Indigo Phoenix is easy for me.” Lil’ Purple continued, “If you can’t last over an hour this time, I won’t let you off easily!”

She glared at Lin Yun with the most ferocious look she could muster, but it made her look even more adorable. So Lin Yun smiled and gently nodded his head.

Two hours later, Lin Yun ascended the mountain once more where the azure-clothed figure was waiting for him. Looking at Lin Yun, the azure-clothed figure wore a smile because he didn’t believe that Lin Yun could learn anything in just two hours. “How was it?”

“Not bad, I guess,” replied Lin Yun.

“If you really want to learn how to use a flute, I can teach you. As long as you give up on the test, I have plenty of time to teach you. What do you think?” The azure-clothed figure asked.

Honestly speaking, Lin Yun was very tempted, but he had other priorities, “I refuse.”

“Hmph, if you dared to agree to his request, this empress would have taught you the true meaning of despair.” Lil’ Purple was satisfied with Lin Yun’s reply.

The azure-clothed figure was briefly stunned when he heard that before he said, “Let’s get started then.”

With a flick of his finger, he lit up the incense on the cliff once more and played his flute. Lin Yun also maintained his composure and placed the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute by his lips.

This scene made the azure-clothed figure wear a playful smile because he didn’t think that Lin Yun could learn anything in two hours. In his view, Lin Yun was still too young and needed to learn how to walk before he could run. As music drifted out of his flute, it pounced like a ferocious dragon.

He was planning to use a single note to defeat Lin Yun. But the music that came from Lin Yun’s direction resonated with sword rays and sliced the dragon in half.

“That flute!” The azure-clothed figure was surprised because he could sense that the flute wasn’t simple. So he no longer dared to treat Lin Yun lightly. Just like that, Lin Yun and his music rang out with boundless sword aura.

As their music continued to clash, it looked like two treasured swords were exploding in the air. This left the azure-clothed figure even more shocked because he couldn’t believe that Lin Yun could achieve this level in just two hours.

Noticing the flaw in the azure-clothed figure’s heart, Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly and his music changed. It sounded like countless swords being drawn.

Accumulating boundless sword aura, Lin Yun manifested a massive array. Iris Sword Sutra—Unrivaled.

“He’s going to overtake me!” The azure-clothed figure’s heart sank when he saw that Lin Yun didn’t want to simply pass the test, but launch a counterattack too. In the next second, Azure Birds flew out of his body and charged towards the massive array.

But naturally, Lin Yun wasn’t an easy target. So he changed his tune, which caused the Iris Sword Array to reverse circulate. Primal Origin—Praise the Phoenix!

When the array circulated nine times, an indigo Ice Phoenix flew out of the breathtaking array, destroying all the Azure Birds with just one exchange.

Seeing this, the azure-clothed figure’s music came to a stop and he lowered his flute, “I lost.”

He knew that he was careless. Plus, Lin Yun’s flute had a huge origin. The moment he revealed his flaw, Lin Yun pounced like a true genius. Lin Yun’s reaction was terrifyingly fast, not to mention that it went well with his sword sutra.

“So I’ve passed the test, right?” Lin Yun smiled.

Nodding his head, the azure-clothed figure replied, “But I wish to know who taught you how to use the flute?”

He was really curious how Lin Yun managed to reach this level in just two hours. He was certain that the person who taught him wasn’t simple, and that it wasn’t something Lin Yun figured out on his own.

“Then you have to listen well. Her title is a little long,” smiled Lin Yun.

“Go ahead,” replied the azure-clothed figure.

“She’s the Divine Phoenix Clan’s Supreme Heavenly Slaughter Empress of Four Seas, Eight Barrens, 36 Heavens, and 72 Earths!”

When the azure-clothed figure heard that long title, he nearly dropped his flute. His mouth twitched at the ridiculously long title.
