Chapter 1231 - Death

When the Golden Crow and Silver Phoenix let out a cry, a dazzling radiance surged out of Lin Yun’s palm. As the space above him distorted, it looked like Lin Yun had grasped heaven and earth. In the next second, Lin Yun’s palm radiated with a chaotic light that contained unbelievable destructive prowess.

When the two attacks collided together, they caused a huge explosion. Facing Lin Yun’s attack, Xiahou Jue was sent flying back. At the same time, cracks began to appear on the crimson dragon behind him, along with a terrifying fluctuation that swept out. The fluctuation brought out all sorts of phenomena that made everyone who saw it shocked.

The disciples of the Crimson Moon Elysium were entirely dumbfounded, but they soon recovered from their shock. They now knew why their senior brother was so cautious even though Lin Yun’s sword intent was useless because of the poison.

If Xiahou Jue didn’t activate his Blood Saint Dragon, he would have faced a fate worse than flying back. He would have been heavily injured and he would have lost at least 30% of his fighting prowess.

“It’s impressive that you can practice two holy spirits at the same time. But I wonder how many trump cards you have left? My cultivation stands right here, and it has not been raised by using any secret techniques!” Xiahou Jue snickered as he wiped the blood off his lips.

He wasn’t wrong with those words, since cultivation was the foundation for every cultivator. Although cultivators could increase their power through their attacks and secret techniques, cultivation was still the foundation to everything.

Xiahou Jue was clearly injured, but he didn’t care about the surging vitality in his body and dashed at Lin Yun before he could unleash his phenomenon.

“Die!” His long nails turned into dragon claws that were aimed at Lin Yun’s face. But Lin Yun calmly formed seals with both hands, allowing the Demonic Astral Flowers in his aura oceans to bloom.

When Xiahou Jue’s attack reached him, Lin Yun was done forming his seals. Then, the seven Demonic Astral Flowers in each of his aura oceans began to blaze.

In the next second, 49 flowers began to blaze behind Lin Yun, and each layer made Lin Yun’s aura soar even further. When all 49 flowers bloomed, Lin Yun’s aura broke through the boundaries of the Empyrean Realm, reaching the pinnacle of a lesser Elysium Core Realm expert.

“H-how is this possible…” Xiahou Jue squinted his fear-filled eyes. It was already too late for him to retreat.

When the terrifying aura swept out from Lin Yun, it instantly sent Xiahou Jue flying. In mid-air, Xiahou Jue threw up another mouthful of blood and his facial expression became ugly.

Standing in the sea of flowers, Lin Yun stood in mid-air with starlight shining out of every single inch of his clothes. Empowered by the 49 flowers, Lin Yun could feel that the empowerment was a lot stronger than when he was in the Heavenly Soul Realm.

This was the first time he activated the Demonic Astral Flowers while he was in the Empyrean Realm. Empowered by his sword intent, his cultivation was actually comparable to a lesser Elysium Core Realm expert. It was probably because astral energy was more suitable with the Demonic Astral Flowers compared to origin energy.

In the next second, Lin Yun emitted a terrifying aura that didn’t belong to someone who was poisoned. The poison in his blood could last for four hours, which should be enough time for him to defeat Xiahou Jue.

Then again, there might be mishaps in the process, so he had to get rid of the poison as soon as possible. As Lin Yun’s eyes flickered, he raised his head to look at the crimson moon once more.

When Lin Yun summoned the 49 Demonic Astral Flowers, they drew exclamations from the audience while everyone looked at Lin Yun with shock. The limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm was a legend that everyone had heard of but had never seen. Who would have thought that Lin Yun would show them this legend?

“So the rumors were true…” Chu Tianhao’s gaze became distracted since the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm was stronger than he had imagined.

“This fellow really has a lot of means!” Xiahou Jue could sense that after Lin Yun activated the Demonic Astral Flowers, his aura was a lot stronger. Even without using his sword, Lin Yun could rely on his aura to confront or even crush Xiahou Jue.

“Let me see how strong your determination to win is.” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed as he activated the Golden Crow Nine Transformations. When he took a step out, a sonic boom exploded as he arrived before Xiahou Jue while being accompanied by boundless flames.

When Lin Yun threw out his punch, it was equivalent to a sword’s thrust. Under his sword, the air before him was like a myriad of blades that were blown apart by his fist. At the same time, space was being compressed and formed countless visible fluctuations.

“Blood Dragon Break!” But facing Lin Yun’s attack, Xiahou Jue pushed himself to the limit and let out a burst of laughter. He faced Lin Yun’s punch head-on. When the two fists collided, it was like two blazing cauldrons had collided in mid-air. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

With a grin, cuts appeared on Xiahou Jue’s arm that was covered in scales. After clashing with Lin Yun head-on, he launched another attack on Lin Yun’s right shoulder before Lin Yun could react. He wanted to worsen Lin Yun’s injuries, which would make the poison that was circulating throughout the body even faster.

After several collisions, a ruthless light flashed through Lin Yun’s pupils as he threw a punch out. His punch landed on Xiahou Jue’s right shoulder. With a huge collision, the dragon scales on Xiahou Jue’s right shoulder shattered into pieces and a huge hole appeared, dripping blood.

Simultaneously, Xiahou Jue’s punch was headed for Lin Yun’s right shoulder. However, a cold light flashed through Lin Yun’s pupils as his right shoulder jolted against Xiahou Jue’s punch.

The huge rebound force made Xiahou Jue’s arm go numb and his lips twitched. But he treated himself even more ruthlessly as he launched another attack at Lin Yun’s heart despite the rebound force. When his punch landed on Lin Yun’s chest, hundreds of purple-golden dragon runes were ignited. They instantly transformed Lin Yun’s body to the same level as a hundred-rune saint artifact, especially the heart, which had reached an unbelievable height.

Not only did he fail to injure Lin Yun, but he even acquried three broken ribs from Lin Yun’s punch. But before Xiahou Jue could think more about it, he took a punch directly to his face. The bridge of his nose was instantly broken and he threw up a mouthful of blood.

But Lin Yun didn’t let him go so easily and grabbed onto Xiahou Jue’s wrist. Then, he slammed him into the ground, causing cracks to spread out even though the ground was strengthened by arrays.

“Lin Yun, you’ll die a terrible death!” Xiahou Jue yelled, but Lin Yun replied with a ruthless stomp to his face. The brutality of this scene made everyone’s heart jolt violently.

“Senior Brother actually lost in a physical fight…” The Crimson Moon Elysium’s disciples were all dumbfounded by this scene. Even the Grand Elder was panicking after looking at this scene.

As for Ye Ziling and the rest, their faces also became grave because this was a rare opportunity that Lin Yun had obtained after using the 49 Demonic Astral Flowers and the Azure Dragon Saint Physique. But even so, Lin Yun still couldn’t deal any fatal injuries to Xiahou Jue.

As Lin Yun’s aura continued to decline, the poison in his body circulated even faster. As time passes, Lin Yun’s strength would disappear even faster.

Just when Lin Yun wanted to stomp and crush Xiahou Jue’s head, a bone spike suddenly shot towards his forehead. Although Lin Yun threw out a punch to block this attack, the bone spike still sent him flying back.

When the bone spike spread out, Xiahou Jue flew out from the crater with a pair of crimson wings on his back. At the same time, the injuries on his face instantly recovered by 70%, which made Lin Yun frown. At the same time, he looked at the crimson moon in the sky once more because he could feel that there was something wrong with it.

“You can’t even use your sword, but you still forced me to enter the second phase of the Blood Saint Dragon. Looks like I’ve really underestimated you.” Xiahou Jue smirked.

The key to the poison should lie in the crimson moon. Lin Yun took a deep breath as he sensed the poison in his body slowly getting stronger and targeting his heart.

“Don’t even think about it. There’s no solution to the poison!” Xiahou Jue took a deep breath and continued, “If you can draw your sword, there’s no way I can put up a fight against you even if I have numerous trump cards. But it has come to an end now. A monster like you should die and stay dead! Demonic Blood Dragon!” Xiahou Jue snickered as torrential crimson light shone out from his body.

Under the violent storm, the sky became dark and the crimson moon became even more bewitching. Under the moonlight, the spiritual energy in the atmosphere seemed to have been tainted.

Soon, Lin Yun’s eyes lit up since he figured out what was going on.

“Lin Yun, this is my last trump card. If you can block this attack, then I’ll kowtow and admit defeat!” Xiahou Jue smiled. As long as Lin Yun couldn’t resolve the poison in his body, it was practically impossible to take his attack head-on.

When the ground suddenly exploded, a bone frame popped out from the ground like centipedes. The bone frame was tainted red and looked like a crimson bone dragon. In the blink of an eye, the bone dragon grew a hundred feet in size and was shrouded in a deathly aura.

Suddenly, Lin Yun threw up blood because the poison in his body had grown even stronger. At the same time, his lips were turning even darker.

“Lin Yun, admit defeat. After you admit defeat, the poison in your body will dissipate in three days. But if you take my attack head-on, you’ll die a terrible death!” Xiahou Jue calmly looked at Lin Yun as the crimson bone dragon continued to appear behind him. When the dragon’s head radiated a crimson light, the bone dragon looked even more terrifying.

“I’m not someone who will easily admit defeat, not to mention that I haven’t even drawn my sword!” Lin Yun smirked. Waving his hand, the Flower Burial flew out from the sword box.

When Lin Yun grabbed onto his sword, his sword intent soared and black cobwebs began to spread out on his pale face. It was just as Xiahou Jue had said, the poison was using his martial intent as nourishment to grow.

“The stronger your sword intent, the more powerful the poison will become. This means that you’re courting death!” Xiahou Jue said with his teeth gritting while he panicked. After all, Lin Yun was already so strong without drawing his sword, so he couldn’t imagine how strong Lin Yun would become after drawing his sword.

“What you said is right. I’m indeed courting death, but if my sword is fast enough, death might not be able to catch up with me.” Lin Yun raised his head to look at the crimson moon in the sky. Even at the risk of death, Lin Yun had no hesitation to swing his sword.
