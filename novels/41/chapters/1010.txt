Chapter 1011 - Who Is He?!

I’m being suspected as well? Lin Yun was surprised. Then again, it might have something to do with the fact that he was wearing a hood over his head.

“You’re courting death!” Seeing that Lin Yun was hesitating, Mo Xuan’s eyes flashed coldly. His patience was limited and in his eyes, those who hesitated upon being called were simply courting death.

“Mo Xuan, don’t push it. He’s my friend.” Luo Chen roared, seeing the killing intent flashing in Mo Xuan’s pupils. When he spoke, he also unleashed his aura. A month had passed and Luo Chen was a lot stronger than when he faced Yu Haotian. After all, he was the head of the Azure Dragon Region’s ranking and his name was on the ranking in the Heavenly Path.

Although there was a considerable gap between him and the Profound Lightning Twin Swords, he wasn’t completely powerless against them. Plus, Qin Lin and Jun Mengchen also released their auras to show that they would advance and retreat with Luo Chen.

After all, if it wasn’t for Lin Yun, they might have been killed by Yu Haotian. So there was no way they would stand by and do nothing.

Mo Xuan’s face sank when he saw the response of Luo Chen’s group. After all, this was the first time they met resistance after intimidating everyone. The killing intent started to grow in Mo Xuan’s eyes. Clearly, he had no intentions of letting this matter go.

As the atmosphere became tense, Han Lei stopped Mo Xuan, “Luo Chen, we’re not butchers and we’re not targeting your friend on purpose. Just have him come out. If he’s not the person we’re looking for, we naturally won’t make things difficult for him.”

Compared to Mo Xuan, Han Lei was calmer and more composed. As geniuses from war realms, they were a lot stronger than the majority of the realms. Their spiritual sword intent alone was enough to deal with most people, not to mention their lightning aura. Then again, they weren’t invincible because there were troublesome people for them to deal with, such as Luo Chen.

Although Luo Chen couldn’t pose a threat to them, he could still fight them. Chaos would ensue as long as Luo Chen was able to hold them off. At that time, the target they were looking for might take advantage of the chaos to escape.

“I already said that he’s a friend of mine and not the one you’re looking for.” Luo Chen was putting his foot down and wouldn’t budge. After all, everyone knew that Lin Yun had a huge harvest. Although the young masters might not be interested in Lin Yun, the same couldn’t be said for the Profound Lightning Twin Swords.

“What stubbornness!” Han Lei finally lost his temper. After all, he spoke politely to Luo Chen and even gave Luo Chen face. In Han Lei’s eyes, despite being on the ranking, Luo Chen was a troublesome ant.

But right at this moment, Lin Yun walked out of the crowd without saying a word. Luo Chen was shocked, so he called out to Lin Yun, “Brother Lin…”

Lin Yun’s footsteps paused briefly, but he didn’t reply and continued to walk forward. He didn’t want to cause any trouble, but that didn’t mean that he was afraid of trouble. He didn’t mind trouble even if it came from the so-called forbidden existences.

When Lin Yun stepped forward, Han Lei and Mo Xuan’s expressions loosened up before looking at the disguised Pei Xue, “Don’t just stand there. Get out here!”

Pei Xue had already guessed Lin Yun’s identity, so she walked out as well. Not long after, hundreds of people were standing together. When the Profound Lightning Twin Swords stopped looking at the crowd, everyone felt relieved. After all, anything was acceptable as long as the crowd wasn’t condemned.

“Didn’t I say that I’m not the person you’re looking for!” Among the hundreds of people who were called out, a youth with an irritable temper shouted. After all, he was a leader of a higher realm and he wasn’t happy that he was called forward. Even then, there was nothing he could do but bear it inwardly.

“Strip,” said Han Lei coldly.

“What?” The youth was baffled.

“Remove your clothes.” Han Lei said again.

“You’re insane!” The youth finally recovered from his shock and roared, “How dare you!”

He was the leader of a higher realm and was used to being aloof in the Black Tortoise Region. So how could he possibly strip and humiliate himself with so many people watching?

“What games are you guys playing? I’m not interested in playing with you guys anymore!” The youth snorted and decided to leave.

“Who permitted you to leave?” Han Lei wore a mocking smile.

“Don’t push it!” The youth’s face sank when he saw that Han Lei didn’t want to let him go.

“Die then.” Han Lei didn’t waste any time and pointed his finger out, unleashing a bolt of lightning towards the youth.

But in that split second, the youth also pushed his origin energy to the limit and threw out several palms, “Heavenly Origin Palm!”

This was a profound palm technique, a monarch fortune martial technique that the youth had cultivated to a high level. After the brief clash, the youth was still standing. This alone had shocked many people because this was the first time Mo Xuan or Han Lei had failed to kill someone with a single attack.

“Hmph!” The youth snorted coldly and continued, “I told you not to push it. The two of you might have huge fame, but I’m not a pushover either. Others might be afraid of you guys, but not me…”

But as he spoke, his face gradually became ugly while fear flashed in his eyes. He pointed at Han Lei and stammered, “Y-y-you…”

Just when everyone was feeling baffled, the youth took a step forward and charged towards Han Lei. However, as soon as he moved, his head burst apart. The crowd watched this in disbelief. After all, the youth named Zheng Rong was the leader of a higher realm with huge fame in the Black Tortoise Region.

Han Lei had no change on his face as he examined Zheng Rong’s corpse. “It’s not him.”

Tossing the corpse away, Zheng Rong’s corpse suddenly exploded. Looking at this scene, there was no change on Lin Yun’s face because it was the same as his Lightning Cocoon. If you couldn’t figure out how it worked, there was nothing you could do even if you had high attainment in your cultivation technique.

By compressing sword aura as fine as a strand of hair, one could easily pierce through origin energy and enter the opponent’s body. If it was fast enough, the victim wouldn’t even feel any pain.

Lin Yun glanced at Pei Xue. He could see that although Pei Xue tried her best to maintain her composure, her pupils were flashing with anxiety. This confirmed his suspicion that the war realms were looking for her. Although getting someone to strip was a little brutish, it was an effective method.

With Zheng Rong as an example, everyone else stripped obediently. But fortunately, the Profound Lightning Twin Swords only had them remove their upper clothes. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Coming this far, Lin Yun had no doubts that those two were looking for Pei Xue. It didn’t take long for everyone to strip. However, only Lin Yun and Pei Xue were clothed. As a female, even if Pei Xue used some means to conceal her figure, there was no way she could strip in public.

Mo Xuan looked at Lin Yun before his gaze fell onto Pei Xue, “Strip!”

Even Han Lei was watching. After all, Lin Yun had someone backing him up, so they decided not to force him for now. They thought it would be easier if they dealt with Pei Xue first.

Their words made Pei Xue’s face change because this was too humiliating for her. She did have a treasure that could change the final ranking, but there was no way she could hand it over because she still needed it.

As time passed, Mo Xuan and Han Lei gradually sensed that there was something unusual about the disguised Pei Xue and their gazes became sharp, “Strip or die!”

The two of them slowly flew over with terrifying sword aura unleashed while the lightning runes in their aura oceans began to emit an ancient aura. Meanwhile, Pei Xue became unprecedentedly nervous and her face turned ugly. As Mo Xuan and Han Lei’s eyes flashed with killing intent, their eyes were also flickering with excitement.

“You two clearly know that she’s a woman disguised as a man. Why do you want her to strip? Isn’t the Elysium Trigram War Realm a little too shady?” Right at this moment, a lazy voice sounded out and drew Han Lei and Mo Xuan’s attention.

“Do you have an opinion about it?” Mo Xuan squinted his eyes and wore a playful smile. He would’ve made his move earlier if it wasn’t for the task assigned to him. But now that he had found their target, he naturally had no reservation to attack. Although he was smiling, everyone could sense the chill in his tone.

“What’s the matter? Are you angry now that you’re being embarrassed?” Lin Yun sneered. Everyone could hear the mockery in his tone. Lin Yun must’ve lost his mind to provoke those two after witnessing their strength.

“Die!” Mo Xuan’s smile froze as he raised his hand.
