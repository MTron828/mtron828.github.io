Chapter 2168: No Longer Young When The Flowers Bloom Again

When Lin Yun returned to his residence to rest, the Dao Yang Palace already received news of his return. At the foot of the Dao Yang Mountain, the Dao Yang Palace stood majestically with countless palaces decorating around it, looking like bright stars.

In the main hall of the Dao Yang Palace, the Serene Dust Great Saint, Dragon Origin Great Saint, and Heavenly Jade Sword Saint were gathered here with Dao Yang Holy Son standing at the back. The Great Saints gathered here weren’t naturally because of Lin Yun’s matters, and there were other important matters.

The Serene Dust Great Saint frowned, “Thousand Plume, we might not have any evidence, but there are many clues pointing to that lass from the Wang Clan being the holy maiden of the Blood Moon Sect, and she might even be a divine maiden.”

Wang Muyan possessed the Lunar Yin Saint Physique, not to mention that she practiced the Thousand-Faced Demonic Art. As a result, many people already suspected that she might have a relationship with the demonic sects. But because of the Wang Clan’s status in the Heavenly Dao Sect, no one dared to speak out as there wasn't any conclusive evidence.

The Wang Clan wasn’t only an Ancient Saint Clan, but they were deeply rooted in the Heavenly Dao Sect for thousands of years, firmly holding onto the Heavenly Yin Palace. This meant that they held high authority in the Heavenly Dao Sect.

The Heavenly Dao Sect had two palaces, three courtyards, and seventy-two peaks. The two palaces were naturally the Dao Yang Palace and Heavenly Yin Palace. The two palaces had an aloof position with a powerful foundation and inheritance.

The Serene Dust Great Saint and Heavenly Jade Sword Saint were already suspicious of Wang Muyan, not to mention they received a warning from Lin Yun. So they managed to discover something, but they couldn’t find any conclusive evidence as Wang Muyan had been cautious.

The Thousand Plume Great Saint said with a grave expression, “Everyone is aware of it, but we don’t know how many of the Wang Clan are involved. There’s something even more terrifying right now. The Ninth Princess gave information to all the holy lands of the Eastern Desolation, stating that the Blood Moon Sect has colluded with the Demonspirit Clan, and their objective might be the God Burial Mountain Range.”

“The God Burial Mountain Range?” The Dragon Origin Great Saint was shocked. He asked, “How is that possible? Don’t tell me that it’s related to that Blood Monarch?”

“Blood Monarch?” Dao Yang Holy Son asked. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint glanced at him, and she said, “Three thousand years ago, there were Three Monarchs aside from the Nine Emperors that were on the same level. From a certain degree, they were even stronger than the Nine Emperors. The sect master of the Blood Moon Sect was one of the Three Monarchs, known as the Blood Monarch. He was already famous before the rise of the Nine Emperors, and he was invincible in the world, ruling the Kunlun Realm. At that time, the Blood Moon Sect’s flag could be seen everywhere, and they’re known as the strongest sect in the world.”

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint paused briefly, and he continued, “The Blood Monarch was ultimately defeated by the Southern Emperor. But there were rumors that the Blood Monarch wasn’t dead, and the Southern Emperor wasn’t able to kill him. His corpse was rumored to be sealed in the God Burial Mountain Range.”

The Dao Yang Holy Son was shocked, and he exclaimed, “Even the Southern Emperor wasn’t able to kill him?”

He thought of a certain possibility, but he didn’t dare to think too much because that speculation was too terrifying. After all, it could only be a deity that even an emperor couldn’t slay. This was because deities were immortal, and no one could kill them aside from another deity.

Since ancient times, only the Iris Sword Saint managed to slay a deity in the Saint Realm, and there wasn’t a second person who achieved that feat.

“Indeed, there are such rumors,” the Thousand Plume Great Saint said in a worried tone. “Furthermore, the place where the Blood Monarch’s corpse was sealed was complicated. The Southern Emperor chose the God Burial Mountain Range because there was a Dragon Clan’s array that was left from ancient times. It was rumored that the Southern Emperor used his own method to perfect the array and seal the corpse in the Six Holy City.”

The Dragon Origin Great Saint said in a worried tone as well, “If that’s the truth, all the Demonspirit Clans suppressed in the God Burial Mountain Range will come out once the Blood Monarch was resurrected. At that time, the Eastern Desolation will fall into chaos, and it will be a catastrophe.”

If the Eastern Desolation fell into chaos, the Heavenly Dao Sect would be first to bear the charge, and this was why the Thousand Plume Great Saint was worried. There was a high possibility for this matter because the resurrection of the Blood Monarch could break the seal. At that time, the Demonspirits sealed in the God Burial Mountain Range would have no more concerns. The seal might have loosen up now, but Saints still couldn’t freely enter the God Burial Mountain Range; only the Quasi-Saint could enter.

The Dragon Origin Great Saint looked at the Thousand Plume Great Saint, and he said, “Thousand Plume, we should make a decision now.”

The Thousand Plume Great Saint fell silent. In the past, everyone could ignore it despite knowing as long as the Heavenly Dao Sect wasn’t endangered. After all, which of the four major clans in the Heavenly Dao Sect didn’t have any dirt on them?

The Thousand Plume Great Saint didn’t like the Ye Clan’s way of doing things and separated himself from them. Otherwise, the Ye Clan’s position would rise further now. This was a tough decision to make as the Heavenly Dao Sect didn’t have a sect master, and it was operated through ancient rules. No one could overpower the other party.

Theoretically speaking, the Thousand Plume Great Saint controlled the Dao Yang Palace, the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint controlled the Nether Orchid Courtyard, the Serene Dust Great Saint controlled the Profound Maiden Courtyard, not to mention there was another Great Saint, the Dragon Origin Great Saint.

Logically speaking, it should be more than enough for them to suppress the Wang Clan and Heavenly Yin Palace, but they couldn’t mobilize the forces of their various clans. So they couldn’t guarantee that there weren’t spies from the Wang Clan in their factions. The moment they fell out, the battle wasn’t as simple as the four of them suppressing the Heavenly Yin Great Saint.

If the matter blew up, it might rip the Heavenly Dao Sect apart. The Zhang Clan and Ye Clan weren’t pushovers, and the results might not be good at that time.

The Thousand Plume Great Saint sighed, “It’s easier said than done. As long as the Heavenly Dao Sect doesn’t have a sect master, we won’t be able to resolve this issue. If we made a move against the Wang Clan, how would the Ye Clan, Bai Clan, and Zhang Clan think? They would think if they might be next. Do you think they will believe that the Blood Monarch might resurrect? Putting it bluntly, even if they believed it, do you think they will be concerned with the life and death of the sect? Who knows, they might hope for the destruction of the Heavenly Dao Sect so that they can divide it up.”

What the Thousand Plume Great Saint said wasn’t wrong because the four major clans were rotted to the core, and clans would naturally place the interest of their clans above the sect. There was no solution to this matter, and everyone knew the issue. If it was that easy, they would’ve taken action long ago.

“Do you think we can join forces with the Ninth Princess?” Dao Yang Holy Son asked tentatively. The moment he said that, the four great saint’s faces became weird, but no one answered.

A long time later, the Dragon Origin Great Saint sneered, “The Divine Dragon Empire probably wanted the Heavenly Dao Sect to be destroyed the most.”

The Thousand Plume Great Saint frowned, “The Ninth Princess isn’t a pushover. The first day she arrived in the Eastern Desolation, she demanded the six holy lands to dispatch Quasi-Saints to accept the command of her Blood Word Battalion.”

The Dragon Origin Great Saint, “So we have to wait for Ye Qingtian to grow up?”

“That’s the best solution,” the Thousand Plume Great Saint said. “Senior Tian Xing told me that Ye Qingtian saw the Emperor Sword, and he nearly brought it back. He had a strong fate, and he might be able to bear ‘Heavenly Dao’ on his shoulders. If he brings back the Emperor Sword, it’s not an issue for the two guardians to listen to him if he’s willing to become the sect master.”

The Heavenly Dao Sect had two divine artifacts, and the two divine artifacts weren’t only famous in the Eastern Desolation, but it was also famous in Kunlun Realm.

But outsiders didn’t know that the two swords wouldn’t show themselves unless the Eastern Desolation was in danger. This meant that the two guardians wouldn’t make a move even if the Heavenly Dao Sect was destroyed. Unless the Heavenly Dao Sect gave birth to a sect master that could bear the weight of ‘Heavenly Dao’ and wield the Emperor Sword, only then can they command the two guardians.

“Don’t even think about it. He won’t agree to it.” A voice sounded from the corner as it came from the Azure River Sword Saint, Ye Guhan. He had been around, and he was just hidden in the shadows.

“But this involved the entire Eastern Desolation, and he should stand out since he has the capability,” the Thousand Plume Great Saint said.

“We’re enough to carry it. Don’t make it tough for a young lad,” Ye Guhan smiled. “Even we don’t dare to bear ‘Heavenly Dao,’ so why are you forcing him to do it? I have discussed it with Senior Tian Xing. He also didn’t want to force a child to bear it, not to mention that the sect isn’t destroyed yet. There are countless powerful sects through the river of time, but how many people know about them? No longer young when the flowers bloom again. Let’s talk about righteousness with him after those from the older generation like us are dead. A young man should do something of his age.”

The surrounding fell silent upon hearing what he said, and the Dragon Origin great Saint broke the silence. He said, “Ye Guhan, we can be considered to be two generations above you, and don’t call yourself old in front of us. Thousand Plume is still from the same clan as you.”

“That’s right. Who’s old? I don’t think I’m old.” The Serene Dust Great Saint glared at Ye Guhan. The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint might not be saying anything, but Ye Guhan could sense that she was unhappy with him.

This made Ye Guhan smile and apologise.

“Speaking of which, what the Azure River Sword Saint said is right. Furthermore…he’s not from the Heavenly Dao Sect, to begin with,” the Serene Dust Great Saint said. Anyone could tell that she didn’t want Lin Yun to bear those two words, and Lin Yun’s identity wasn’t a secret here. Everyone already knew about his identity long ago.

The Thousand Plume Great Saint fell into a long silence before he looked at Ye Guhan, and he smiled, “I didn’t think that you’re strong when you peed your pants when you’re small, but well said. No longer young when the flowers bloom again. A young man should look like a young man, and we should be the one bearing it as his seniors.”

Ye Guhan smiled awkwardly upon having his dirt exposed.

“Master, disciple is willing to bear the two words. I’m born in Heavenly Dao Sect, and I will die in Heavenly Dao Sect,” the Dao Yang Holy Son said.

The Thousand Plume Great Saint scolded, “Don’t try and snatch it. If it belongs to you, you won’t be able to run away even if you wanted.”

“I won’t run,” the Dao Yang Holy Son grinned.

The Thousand Plume Great Saint nodded, “Let’s put it aside for now, but we need to take precautions. It’s time to sweep the Dao Yang Palace, Profound Maiden Courtyard, and the Nether Orchid Courtyard. Let the clans think whatever they want.”

“I agree.”

“It’s long overdue.”

“THat’s right. We have to ensure that our territory isn’t on fire when chaos takes place.” No one had any objections.

“One more thing. Tian Xuanzi will start weighing the Eastern Desolation soon, and he has already set off. His first stop is the Myriad Lightning Sect,” the Thousand Plume Great Saint said.

“That sissy really came?” The Dragon Origin Great Saint had disdain on his face, but he also wore a grave expression, not daring to look down on Tian Xuanzi.

“He can’t wait any longer. Weighing the Eastern Desolation is a lie, and he’s seeking a breakthrough through battles,” the Serene Dust Great Saint said.

The Thousand Plume Great Saint glared at Ye Guhan, and he said, “Look at him? The two of you were the two most outstanding geniuses in the Eastern Desolation back then. But what about now?”

Ye Guhan smiled bitterly, “Master said that he was the strongest genius in the Eastern Desolation in the past thousand years, so much so that he has the strongest talent in Kunlun Realm. So who dares to compete with him?”

“Mhm?” Just when the Thousand Plume Great Saint was about to speak, he smiled, “That brat is here.”
