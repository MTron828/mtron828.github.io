Chapter 1990 - Onwards! The Myriad Graves Valley!

When a figure landed on the ground, Ye Qinghong, Xiao Jingyan, Zhang Kui, and Bai Yizhou took a few steps back before they regained their foothold. Their faces changed with shock as they looked at this person, and they exclaimed, “Bai Xiao!”

Bai Xiao was an older generation saint disciple, and he was someone in the top ten of the King Ranking in the past. Now that he was nearly a hundred years old, his cultivation naturally reached the Quasi-Saint Realm.

On the other hand, Ye Qinghong, Xiao Jingyan, Zhang Kui, and Bai Yizhou were only in the top hundredth of the King Ranking, especially Xiao Jingyan, who’s strength was deep and unfathomable. He must be strong as a person, since he could lead the Wang Clan’s younger generation in the Heavenly Yin Palace despite having a foreign surname.

“Bai Xiao, do you want to meddle in our affairs?” Bai Yizhou furiously looked at Bai Xiao. They might belong to the Bai Clan but weren’t in the same faction. So they had more enmity instead of a close relationship.

Bai Xiao’s face was indifferent as he raised his head, “Bai Yizhou, it’s forbidden to kill a fellow disciple within the sect, and I naturally have to interfere as a Golden Guard.”

“Who’s killing a fellow disciple? We’re only sparing as fellow disciples!” Bai Yizhou said in a strange tone. “He has become famous within the Eastern Desolation after defeating Young Master Wushuang half a month ago. Who within the Eastern Desolation doesn’t know that we have a genius in the Heavenly Dao Sect?”

Nie Wushuang was famous. Even if he had just entered the Eastern Desolation, he was famous as a descendant of the musical clan. Half a month ago, his defeat greatly embarrassed him, making Ye Qingtian famous within the Eastern Desolation, instead.

“Ha.” Bai Xiao sneered. He couldn’t be bothered to argue with these people and merely turned to look at Bai Qingyu, “Don’t get involved with him.”

Bai Qingyu was like a delicate flower with no experience in the outside world, and she wasn’t the same as Ye Qinghong, Xiao Jingyan, Zhang Kui, and Bai Yizhou. But Bai Qingyu clearly failed to understand the hidden meaning in Bai Xiao’s words, and she said indignantly, “He forced my sister to leave and ruined her reputation. I won’t let him off so easily!”

But Bai Xiao merely shook his head and left with Lin Yun.

Seeing this, Bai Qingyu was still fuming and chased after them.

“Is there something wrong with Bai Xiao’s head? How can someone from the Bai Clan stand together with Ye Qingtian?!” Bai Yizhou said furiously. Since the exchange between the two sects, they had been waiting for Ye Qingtian to to come out so that they could teach him a lesson, but it was interrupted by Bai Xiao.

“Bai Xiao can’t protect him for the rest of his life,” Ye Qinghong said coldly. “Let’s just wait. The ancestor has abandoned him, and no one can protect him, not even the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint, nor the Dragon Origin Great Saint, not to mention a tiny Bai Xiao.”

“The Strong Peak Saint Sovereign?” Zhang Kui’s eyes lit up. The Ye Clan’s ancestor might be a Saint Sovereign, but his strength was terrifying, and he was extremely old. He had an unrivaled status within the Heavenly Dao Sect and could mobilize the sect’s resources.

“Ha, the seniors of my Zhang Clan have also reached the limit of their patience with Ye Qingtian,” Zhang Kui added. Before Lin Yun defeated Zhang Yue, he already offended Zhang Yue’s master. So the Zhang Clan naturally disliked him.

“That fellow is really cocky. We must let him know who’s in charge within the Heavenly Dao Sect!” Bai Yizhou said coldly.

Xiao Jingyan suddenly said, “He has been looking into the Myriad Graves Valley for the past few days. I’m guessing that he’s probably planning to leave the sect.”

“Good. Keep a close eye on him. If he dares to step out of the sect, we’ll find an opportunity to get rid of him. Otherwise, we won’t have a bright future once he reaches the Quasi-Saint Realm and joins the golden generation!” Ye Qinghong said.

The other three nodded and left after hearing what Ye Qinghong said.

After leaving the Profound Maiden Courtyard, Lin Yun separated from Bai Xiao and returned to Indigo Thunder Peak. It was different within Indigo Thunder Peak because he had become a legendary figure. Whenever disciples of Indigo Thunder Peak saw him, they would have excitement on their faces, which Lin Yun nodded as a greeting with them.

Lin Yun didn’t take long to meet the Indigo Thunder Peak Master. After the latter heard what Lin Yun said, he asked in a surprised tone, “You’re going to Myriad Graves Valley?”

“Yeah. I’m here to bid you farewell and ask if you have any news about Myriad Graves Valley,” Lin Yun replied. The information was limited in the Contribution Hall and was definitely not as detailed as information from a Quasi-Saint.

“The Myriad Graves Valley is located within the God Burial Mountain Range, and countless ancient tombs exist there. The sins there can cover the clouds, and blood crows can also be found there. But the environment also gave birth to countless bizarre flowers. Although those at the Quasi-Saint Realm can’t enter the Myriad Graves Valley, that doesn’t mean it’s not dangerous there. Many flowers are tainted with sin and are turned into terrifying monsters. Aside from that, there are also ancient creatures like the blood crows,” the Indigo Thunder Peak Master shared what he knew about the Myriad Graves Valley.

“As I’ve thought.” Lin Yun’s eyes lit up when he heard that. The Myriad Graves Valley was the land of death, but the vitality was terrifying, which meant that there was something weird about it. If he went there, he could upgrade the Flower Burial Sword, even if he couldn’t find the secrets of Life Intent. With so many bizarre flowers, it should be enough to upgrade the Flower Burial Sword.

“Peak Master, do you know the origin of the vitality there?” Lin Yun asked the crucial question.

“An Udumbara flower,” the Indigo Thunder Peak Master said. The Udumbara Flower was known to be one of the three rare flowers that could actually be found within Myriad Graves Valley. This gave Lin Yun a surprise. If he could find it, he might be able to upgrade the Flower Burial Sword into a Twospirit Glory Saint Artifact.

Lin Yun got a map from the Indigo Thunder Peak Master before bidding his farewell. He didn’t want to waste any time, but before he left, the Indigo Thunder Peak Master’s voice resounded, “Be careful. The Myriad Graves Valley is weird, so keep your guard up.”

Lin Yun nodded his head. But when he left the Indigo Thunder Peak, he ran into Bai Qingyu. Bai Qingyu raised her brow and questioned, “Ye Qingtian, you’re going to the Myriad Graves Valley? Don’t deny it because I heard your conversation.”

Lin Yun was curious about how Bai Qingyu managed to listen to his conversation with the Indigo Thunder Peak Master. Most importantly, he and the Peak Master failed to detect her. But he soon figured Bai Qingyu must have a treasure to conceal her aura. He replied, “It has nothing to do with you.”

Bai Qingyu sneered, “You want to sneak away and shake me off? Dream on! I’m determined to take your head, no matter what!”

Lin Yun’s expression became strange when he heard that. He asked, “You sure you want to kill me? You probably never even killed an ant before in your life.”

When Lin Yun fought her earlier, he could sense that she didn’t have a hint of murderous intent on her, and she was just a delicate flower. She might have a strong foundation, a Twospirit Glory Saint Artifact, or even other treasures, but it wouldn’t change the fact that she was too inexperienced. When fighting others, it would be impressive if she could even bring out 30% of her strength.

Without mentioning Lin Yun, even a wandering cultivator at the Nirvana Stage could find ways to kill her.

Being exposed by Ye Qingtian only made Bai Qingyu feel ashamed, and she roared, “How have I not taken lives before? My sister and the clan elders told me that I could shine in the Golden Era with my talent and even become an Emperor in the future!”

“Oh? So I’m talking with a future Emperor?” Lin Yun smiled.

“Hmph, good that you know now,” Bai Qingyu said proudly.

Lin Yun couldn’t be bothered with this brat and disappeared, flying past her.

“Ye Qingtian, don’t even think about leaving! I have to take your head today, no matter what!” Bai Qingyu snorted and chased after Lin Yun, executing an ancient movement technique. But it was a pity that Lin Yun was faster than her, and he soon disappeared from her sight.

“Damn it, where did that bastard go?!” Bai Qingyu said furiously. She yelled, “Ye Qingtian, we’ll see! I won’t let you go so easily!”

Lin Yun glanced back at Bai Qingyu from far away but wasn’t too bothered about her.

An hour later, Lin Yun left the Heavenly Dao Sect. He wore black clothes with a bamboo hat as he rode on Lil’ Red in its Dragon-Blooded Horse form. The journey to the God Burial Woods was far, and it was more appropriate to ride the Dragon-Blooded Horse. Firstly, Lil’ Red wasn’t slow and Lin Yun could save his nirvana aura to handle unexpected situations.

Not long after he left, the news of Ye Qingtian heading to the Myriad Graves Valley spread throughout the Heavenly Dao Sect.

“That trouble maker has finally left the Heavenly Dao Sect. I heard he’s heading to the Myriad Graves Valley.”

“The Myriad Graves Valley? Are there even treasures there? So many people’s eyes are on him, so isn’t it the same as courting death to leave the Heavenly Dao Sect?!”

“His safety can still be ensured in the sect, but who will care about him outside?”Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“You can’t put it that way. He can’t possibly stay within the Heavenly Dao Sect for the rest of his life.”

The news spread like wildfire, and the whole Eastern Desolation knew about it in just half a day. Many people learned that Ye Qingtian had gone to the Myriad Graves Valley, thanks to Nie Wushuang. Nie Wushuang had a huge fame, and Ye Qingtian became famous after trampling on him. In addition to his fame within the Heavenly Dao Sect, there were many rumors that he was catching up to the golden generation within the sect, not to mention his scandal with the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden.

So many people wanted to take a look at Ye Qingtian, who forced the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden to leave the Heavenly Dao Sect.

When Ye Qinghong heard that Ye Qingtian had left the sect, he was excited, “I never expected him to leave so quickly. Quick, let the ancestor know about this!”

“The Myriad Graves Valley is within the God Burial Mountain Range, the perfect place to take his life. Ye Qingtian is simply courting death!” Zhang Kui, Bai Yizhou, and Ye Qinghong immediately dispatched people from their clans to the God Burial Mountain Range.

In a courtyard within the Heavenly Yin Palace, Wang Muyan was cultivating as an overwhelming fragrance swirled around her. Xiao Jingyan suddenly appeared and said, “Holy Maiden, the news has already spread. The Zhang Clan, Bai Clan, and Ye Clan have made their moves. Are we going to make a move as well?”

“Of course,” Wang Muyan smiled, opening her eyes. “I’ve wanted to know who he is for a long time, and if he’s that person. After all, he’s the biggest variable for the Divine Sect!”
