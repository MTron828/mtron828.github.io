Chapter 1693 – Prairie Phoenix Fire

Mu Xueling was trying to teach them the profundity of music dao that ordinary musicians couldn’t grasp. While taking a look at everyone, Mu Xueling placed her hands on the zither before gently strumming it, and she roared, “Wind!” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Along with a strum, a wisp of light flew out from the zither, manifesting into a violent gale that blew within the Saint Altar. It didn’t take long for everyone to start feeling pain from the wind, and they had no choice but to resist with their dragon origin.

Squinting his eyes, Lin Yun raised his head and noticed that the zither string was still trembling.

What’s going on? Lin Yun questioned himself. He could also do the same, but it was practically impossible for him to last this long.

“The strings of a zither are different from the other instruments. Are long as you have the proper method, the note can last a long time. Then again, you can also unleash them all in a bursting manner.” Mu Xueling’s fingers swiftly strummed the zither, and the speed was so fast that afterimages were left behind.

As zither notes resounded, there was a pause between each one, but each note existed individually, and each note turned into a terrifying tornado. In the blink of an eye, one tornado after another appeared within the Saint Altar, blowing back and forth.

This made many people feel terrible as they circulated their cultivation techniques to resist, fearing that they might be dragged into the tornado. When the violent gale dissipated, Mu Xueling suddenly raised her head, revealing her stunning appearance.

All of the wind within a hundred feet gathered around her, and the invisible wind was like a liquid forming into an ocean.

When Lin Yun’s ears twitched, he could hear the sound of the ocean flowing from Mu Xueling’s zither music. The wind seemed to have become an ocean, and Mu Xueqin was seated on the ocean.

Whenever Mu Xueling played a note, the ocean would ripple with waves, and the wind turned into a tornado that reached ten feet above her, along with her music. When a terrifying aura swept out, the tornado seemed to have come to life and roared along with the zither music.

This shocked everyone, fearing that the tornado might devour them. This also left surprise on Lin Yun’s face because Mu Xueling was only using Noble Tone. But she had shocked everyone, and it didn’t seem taxing for her to achieve it.

There were many ruthless people around. Aside from the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s disciples, there were also geniuses from other domains, including geniuses from Ancient Saint Clans. They practiced music dao from a young age and even possessed a rare mental cultivation technique. But at this moment, they were all filled with admiration for Mu Xueling.

“That’s not all.” Along with Mu Xueling’s voice, her fingers moved quickly, playing a different note, and the surroundings became dark. Wind, fire, lightning, and ice. Phenomena of different attributes appeared along with her zither music.

Lin Yun was utterly captivated by her skills, and he engraved every detail in his mind. At this moment, the aura emitted from Mu Xueling shocked everyone. When her zither music calmed down, everyone’s emotions were high, and their attention was unprecedentedly focused.

Lightly nodding her head, Mu Xueling swept her gaze over everyone, before her gaze fell onto Lin Yun. Seeing that he was entirely focused was utterly different from the impression he gave her yesterday. His fingers were also moving, and he seemed to be comprehending. This instantly made her doubt if he was putting on an act.

The contrast was too great, which made Mu Xueling suspicious. After all, Lin Yun possessed a Sovereign Constellation, and he did not need to waste time on music dao. While she was pondering, Lin Yun suddenly raised his head and smiled.

Retracting her gaze, Mu Xueling continued her explanation, going into detail about the profundity of what she had done earlier. Everyone in the surroundings was listening seriously, and there were geniuses amongst them. They gave it an attempt, and they could already mimic Mu Xueling. Tornados of different sizes didn’t take long to start appearing in the Saint Altar.

Looking at them, Lin Yun knew they were all geniuses in music dao, since they could comprehend it after one explanation. Although there was no way they could be compared to Mu Xueling, it was already impressive. Amongst them, there were a few who held back when they tried.

They all had strong mental energy, and sixth-grade Saint Spiritualists were amongst the crowd. They knew they were competitors, so they didn't need to reveal too much.

Lin Yun soon retracted his gaze and wasn’t too bothered. He also had no intentions of giving it a try. He came to the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion for the Nirvana Banquet’s quota to confirm his speculation if the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion and Nirvana Palace were related to each other and complete the task given to him by Big Brother Jiang.

Suddenly, exclamations resounded from the surroundings as a tornado the size of ten feet appeared.

“It’s Senior Brother Jiang Feng!”

“Senior Brother Jiang Feng is really strong to comprehend it so thoroughly so quickly.”

“As expected of Senior Brother Jiang.” Multiple gazes were surprised as they looked at Jiang Feng. After all, this proved that Jiang Feng had an impressive talent.

Along with his zither music, the tornado circled the Saint Altar before it charged towards Lin Yun’s direction. Jiang Feng was wearing a smile as he gently flicked his finger. Before the tornado was about to come in contact with Lin Yun, it suddenly turned around and swept its tail out.

This gave Lin Yun, Lin Wan, and Luo Shuyi no choice but to lower their heads to avoid the tail sweep. When Jiang Feng’s zither stopped, the tornado disappeared, and the two ladies furiously glared at him, “Jiang Feng, what are you trying to do?!”

“Hahaha, sorry about that. I was a little too excited and made a mistake. Brother Lin, are you alright?” Jiang Feng smiled with his brow raised, looking at Lin Yun with a provocative gaze.

“I’m fine.” Lin Yun merely glanced at Jiang Feng as he reached out to stop Lin Wan.

“Coward.” Jiang Feng said coldly, with mockery filling his pupils.

“This is only a small trick, and there will be teachers to guide you with it. So I won’t be wasting time on it. Today, I will teach you guys an ancient score, the Prairie Phoenix Fire.” Mu Xueling said, and the surrounding immediately fell into silence with everyone’s pupils blazing with flames.

After all, a complete ancient musical score was rare, and even the disciples of the Ancient Saint Clans present showed an interest in it.

Lin Yun also fell into deep thought before his gaze became more focused.

“The biggest advantage a musician has over a martial cultivator is that they can fight multiple enemies by themselves, and it’s easy for them to fight foes with higher cultivation than them. I killed over a hundred demonic beasts in the same cultivation with the Prairie Phoenix Fire when I was still at the Dragon Pulse Realm. So you guys have to learn well. I will teach you the first portion today.” Mu Xueling swept her gaze out and continued, “After I’m done, I’ll be testing you guys.”

Everyone present was a genius amongst the younger generation, and they became more focused after hearing what Mu Xueling said. After all, this was an opportunity for them to display their talents in front of Mu Xueling.

Mu Xueling was a Quasi-Saint, and she even grasped the Imperial Tone that allowed her to confront Saints, not to mention that she was a beauty. She gave off an icy aura like an iceberg, but she was also filled with an educated aura that made her absolutely charming.

“The Prairie Phoenix Fire focuses on the wild artistic conception yet simultaneously contains a wisp of loneliness. This sort of artistic conception isn’t easy to comprehend because you’ll lose the loneliness if you’re too wild, and vice-versa. This score is complicated, involving over a thousand changes in musical notes. It’s not easy to play, even if it’s just the first portion. We will start with the unison of the twelve notes…” Mu Xueling’s explanation was thorough. The complexity was all explained by her, and it wasn’t too hard for everyone.

Occasionally, someone would ask questions, and Mu Xueling would answer them. As an expert comparable to a Saint, Mu Xueling was plain yet had a barrier around her that made it tough for others to approach.

It didn’t take long for the majority of the people present to furrow their brows. This was because the musical score was complicated. Even if Mu Xueling’s explanation was thorough, there were still many parts they couldn’t comprehend. They couldn’t play it smoothly, nor could they grasp the artistic conception of the music.

On the other hand, Lin Yun’s eyes flickered as he fell into deep thoughts because it wasn’t as challenging as he had imagined. At the very least, it would be easy if he played it with the Divine Phoenix Touch.

As he lowered his head and briefly strummed the zither strings, he was confident that he could play it. When he raised his head, he saw Mu Xueling’s gaze directed at him. This made him feel weird, but he nodded before turning his eyes away from Mu Xueling’s gaze.

“Don’t force yourself. It’ll be good enough if you guys can grasp 30% of it on your first try. I will play the complete score once, and you can comprehend it from my music.” Mu Xueling said and started to play the zither.

When she started playing, her temperament became ethereal, giving her a disposition that she was a fairy who came to the mortal world. The musical notes looked like they were alive whenever her fingers moved.

Lin Yun closed his eyes to listen to the music. A heat wave swept out not long after as the musical notes in the air intertwined, brightly lighting up like lamps. When the song reached its climax, a phoenix flew out from the dazzling light, letting out a phoenix cry.

As the phoenix merged with the song, it placed everyone in a profound state. The phoenix cry was fake, but the music was real. Reality merged with the fake, making it hard for others to differentiate between what was real and what was fake. At this moment, it felt as though time and space had been distorted.

Phoenixes existed since ancient times, while the zither music was played presently. But the two were tied together under Mu Xuling’s music, leaving everyone stumped. They couldn’t imagine how someone could achieve something so bizarre with music.

When the music ended, everyone cheered, and their pupils were shocked as they looked at Mu Xueling.

When Lin Yun opened his eyes, he lightly furrowed his brows because he could sense that something was lacking in this song. But he couldn’t find the problem, which made him feel butterflies in his stomach.

“Who’s willing to come and try? If I’m satisfied, I’ll reward you with a Profound Saint Pellet.” Mu Xueling said.

The Profound Saint Pellet was extremely rare. It could increase the mental energy of a spiritualist. Pellets with such an effect were rare, not to mention one that reached the saint grade.

“Saint Elder, Jiang Feng is willing to give it a try.” Jiang Feng stood out with flames blazing in his pupils.

Mu Xueling lightly nodded her head, and it didn’t take long for a few more people to stand up. After all, there was no lack of competitors before beauty, and it didn’t take long for close to ten people to stand out.

“Young Master Lin, you’re not coming up to try?” Mu Xueling said, looking at Lin Yun.

“Me?” After confirming that Mu Xueling meant him, he replied, “I haven’t gotten it yet. So I won’t embarrass myself.”

“At least a barbarian like you knows some self-knowledge. But aren’t you a little too arrogant to refuse when the Saint Elder called out your name? You’re not giving the Saint Elder face?” Jiang Feng snickered. He was determined to embarrass Lin Yun in public.
