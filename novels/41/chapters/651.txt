Chapter 652 - Forcing Me To Draw My Sword

Feng Wuhen, Bloodwolf, and Chief Leng’s faces turned pale as they fell to the ground. When they got back on their feet, their eyes were filled with disbelief.

“Damn it!” Chief Leng was the most injured among the three. Wiping the blood off his lips, he looked at Lin Yun with a complicated gaze and began to feel regret. Earlier, if he knew that Lin Yun was so powerful, he definitely wouldn’t have dared to bring him, even if he was a hundred times more gutsy.

Back then, he thought that it would be easy to crush Lin Yun the moment Lin Yun no longer had any value. But now, he realized how big of a joke that was.

“How did that brat do that? His physique alone is comparable to my Flamedragon Armor!” Compared to Chief Leng, Bloodwolf’s eyes were filled with fear. He couldn’t help feeling his scalp turn numb when he realized that Lin Yun’s physique was comparable to his defences.

“Damn it! This kid…” Feng Wuhen glared at Lin Yun with a torrential killing aura filling his pupils. The combined attacks of these three could threaten someone in the greater Yin-Yang stage, but Lin Yun managed to withstand it by relying on his physique alone.

Lin Yun retracted his fist and said, “Let her go.”

He was looking at Leng Xiangyun and his tone was unquestionable. This caused Chief Leng, Bloodwolf, and Feng Wuhen’s faces to change. They all looked at Lin Yun with shock. The two chiefs also looked at Leng Xiangyun nervously as they didn’t dare to make a decision carelessly.

“What are you trying to do?!” Feng Wuhen probed. He then said firmly, “You want to sacrifice her and get the Blood-Devour Demonic Canon for yourself? You wish!”

Even Bloodwolf and Chief Leng glared at Lin Yun ruthlessly. This made Leng Xiangyun’s face change as her lips began to tremble. She didn’t know who to put her faith in when even her biological father couldn’t be trusted.

But despite that, she still held a trace of hope in her heart. She hoped that Lin Yun would be different from others as she looked at Lin Yun with watery eyes.

“Sacrifice?” Lin Yun looked at the altar before turning to the two chiefs controlling Leng Xiangyun. Thinking about what Feng Wuhen said previously with the current situation, he instantly understood the current situation.

But when he thought through it, his face immediately became cold. For a long time, he heard that demonic cultivators had cast away their humanity. However, this was the first time he had truly witnessed it. Leng Xiangyun was only fourteen years old, yet everyone wanted to sacrifice her for the Blood-Devour Demonic Canon.

“I don’t have to explain my actions to you people. Let her go, now,” said Lin Yun as he looked at the two chiefs with his sword intent directed at them. This instantly placed the two under a great pressure as if there was a sword right above their heads. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“You want the Blood-Devour Demonic Canon for yourself? Dream on!” Chief Leng gnashed his teeth. He nurtured Leng Xiangyun for so many years, specifically for today. So how could he possibly hand her over to Lin Yun?

“You don’t have a choice.” Lin Yun raised his brow as he unleashed a golden light. Taking a step forward, he left behind seven afterimages in the air and each afterimage threw out a punch. When the seven afterimages overlapped together, a lightning bolt shot over.

Before the two chiefs got a clear look at Lin Yun’s actions, one of them was sent flying. As for the other chief, he managed to appear above Lin Yun as he tried to smash Lin Yun’s head.

“Get lost!” Lin Yun grabbed onto the chief’s wrist as the Azure Dragon Mark on his chest began to flicker. When the Azure Dragon Mark was activated, Lin Yun’s heart began to throb violently as waves of terrifying energy coursed through his veins, granting him explosive power.

Empowered by the terrifying strength, Lin Yun ripped that chief’s arm off. This caused the chief to cry out in pain while others were dumbfounded by Lin Yun’s brute strength.

“Let’s go!” Lin Yun grabbed hold of Leng Xiangyun and retreated to the entrance before Feng Wuhen, Bloodwolf, and Chief Leng could react.

“Stop him!” Feng Wuhen, Bloodwolf, and Chief Leng recovered from their shock as their faces changed. Clearly, they didn’t expect that Lin Yun would actually try and leave this place with Leng Xiangyun. How could they possibly allow Lin Yun to leave?

“How annoying!” Killing aura began to pour out of Lin Yun’s pupils. Inside his sword box, the Flower Burial Sword was trembling in excitement as boundless sword intent began to accumulate within Lin Yun’s body. When the accumulated sword intent reached its limit, Lin Yun’s body began to tremble like a volcanic eruption.

It looks like these people hadn’t learned their lesson as they were forcing him to draw his sword. Looking at the trio that was charging at him, Lin Yun sucked in a cold breath as his heart began to throb violently.

Lin Yun’s new aura instantly threatened Bloodwolf, Chief Leng, and Feng Wuhen and looks of surprise filled their faces. Then, they came to a stop, not daring to take another step forward.

“It’s futile. No one can leave here unless we obtain the Blood-Devour Demonic Canon. If you’re willing, we can let you have the cultivation technique and we won’t bother you for your treasures. We’re satisfied as long as you can share the cultivation technique with us,” persuaded Chief Leng as his expression became more amicable.

“Brat, don’t tell me that you’re not interested in the Blood-Devour Demonic Canon. You must be trying to compete in the Draconic Banquet, right? You might be strong, but you still pale in comparison to those top-tiered geniuses on the inner ranking, especially the three kings and seven elites. The seven elites are all in the pinnacle Yin-Yang stage. As for the three kings, they’re existences who can confront Heavenly Soul Realm experts. However, if you have the Blood-Devour Demonic Canon, you might have a chance at the top ten,” smiled Feng Wuhen as he tried to tempt Lin Yun.

“Are you done?” Lin Yun looked at Feng Wuhen coldly.

“You!” Feng Wuhen wanted to vomit blood as he held onto the Indigoflame Thunderwhip tightly with torrential hatred in his heart. If his physique was slightly stronger, he would be able to bring out 50% of the Indigoflame Thunderwhip’s power. Then, Lin Yun wouldn’t be in a position to act so arrogantly towards him.

For years, he had ruled over the Cloud Prefecture as a demonic cultivator. However, during his reign, he had never felt so humiliated by a youth.

“Why bother with all that bullshit? We can just bring out our martial souls and slaughter him,” said Bloodwolf as his gaze turned ferocious. If they put their lives on the line, they were totally capable of killing Lin Yun.

“Try me,” sneered Lin Yun. The Flower Burial Sword within the sword box was still brewing. It was so intense that some blood had started to seep out from his skin.

There was no question that a Yin-Yang stage expert would be terrifying when they brought out their martial soul. However, they probably never experienced how terrifying the xiantian sword intent at complete mastery was!
