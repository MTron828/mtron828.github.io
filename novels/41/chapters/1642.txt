Chapter 1643 - Azure Dragon Is Here!

Seeing how emotional the Azure Dragon Lord was made Lin Yun baffled because he never expected that the Azure Dragon Lord would be so expressive upon seeing the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella. One must know that Jiang Ling was the Dragon Gate Lord. So, what kind of treasure had he not seen before?

“Is this umbrella very powerful?” Lin Yun said with uncertainty.

“It’s strong.” Jiang Ling couldn’t bear to let go of the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella and sighed, “If I had this with me back then, it would have been more convenient to kill them.”

“Aren’t there divine artifacts?” Lin Yun asked.

Jiang Ling knocked on Lin Yun’s head and rolled his eyes in disdain, “What does a brat like you know? There are only ten divine artifacts in the Kunlun Realm, and each of them is extremely precious. The price of using a divine artifact isn’t comparable to sovereign saint artifacts, and this umbrella isn’t inferior to a divine artifact in the hands of the Azure Dragon’s lineage.”

Lin Yun’s eyes lit up when he heard that. The Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella wasn’t inferior to a divine artifact in the hands of the Azure Dragon’s lineage? It’s no wonder why it was so tough for him to undo the first seal. In his hands, he could only use it like a mace to smash his enemies.

“What are you thinking about?” Jiang Ling asked.

“Haha. I’m hoping Big Brother can help me undo the seal on the umbrella!” Lin Yun smiled. He decided he would never tell Jiang Ling that the umbrella was no different from a mace in his hands because it would be too embarrassing.

“Hahaha! Good!” Jiang Ling laughed, wielding the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella. “Observe. I’ll undo the first restriction first, Sun-Moon Radiance!”

When the umbrella opened up in Jiang Ling’s hands without any resistance, the glorysun and glorymoon spirits engraved on the umbrella were activated. As a faint radiance blazed on the umbrella, a sun and a moon flew out.

When Jiang Ling opened the umbrella, it felt like he had opened up the thirty-six layers of heaven with the heaven and earth were trembling. When Lin Yun looked at Jiang Ling, it felt like Jiang Ling was far beyond his reach. As the sun and moon revolved, even the surrounding space became distorted.

Lin Yun briefly pondered before he stretched his hand out. Just when he was about to touch Jiang Ling, it felt like the space was stretched apart. Jiang Ling was close to his reach, but he couldn’t touch Jiang Ling, no matter how much he tried.

“How bizarre.” Lin Yun was breath-taken by this scene.

“You don’t need to find it strange just because the surrounding space is affected. If you reach my height, you can fully unleash the power of this umbrella, and you can control the spatial fluctuations as you wish. As long as your strength has reached a certain height, no one can touch you when the sun and moon revolve.” Jiang Ling smiled.

“Open!” Jiang Ling roared. A starry sky appeared above the sun and moon with star light shining down. The next moment, a crescent moon symbol appeared within the Azure Dragon Lord’s pupils. Along with an explosion, nine azure dragons flew out from the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella and flew around the sky.

“Those are dragon souls, and every single one of those azure dragons was at least at the Great Saint when they’re alive. But the power that they can unleash depends on your martial intent. If your martial intent is strong, the dragons will become terrifying, and they can even fuse with your martial intent.” Jiang Ling explained. “With your Heavenly Dome Sword Intent, the dragons can unleash the power of the Samsara Edict Realm in your hands. It can even reach the Nirvana Stage if you give it your all!”

Lin Yun’s eyes lit up when he heard that because it was a little terrifying.

“But with your current cultivation, you definitely won’t be able to control it well. Even with your Blue Dragon’s Divine Blood and Blue Dragon Bone, you might be unable to bear it. So the strength of the azure dragons will vary.” Jiang Ling said with a grave expression.

“What about in your hands?” Lin Yun asked.

“Pinnacle Saint Realm. When the nine dragons combine, they can even reach the Emperor Realm. But that’s for me, since I’m the Azure Dragon Lord.” Jiang Ling grinned.

The corner of Lin Yun’s lips twitched because the Azure Dragon Lord was a little shameless to praise himself. Jiang Ling folded the umbrella and looked at it, unwilling to part.

“Alright. Keep it well.” Jiang Ling handed the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella to Lin Yun.

“Big Brother, keep it if you like it.” Lin Yun said.

Hearing that, Jiang Ling smiled, “You fool. What are you talking about? Keep it well. I have undone the three seals, and I was still troubled that I didn’t have anything to give you earlier.”

“The third seal is also undone?” Lin Yun asked, taking the umbrella back.

“Yeah.” Jiang Ling nodded. “But I can’t display it for you. The third seal can summon the Azure Dragon Constellation from the thirty-sixth layer of heaven. It’s the actual constellation, not a phenomenon.”

Lin Yun was speechless when he heard that because the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella was wasted to be in his hands.

“Give it a try and see if there’s anything different about it.” Jiang Ling smiled.𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Okay.” Lin Yun held onto the umbrella and poured his dragon runes into it. Suddenly, everything disappeared before him as he was beyond the thirty-sixth layer of heaven. He could see the stars forming into astral clusters before developing into a massive constellation. That pair of eyes was the Azure Dragon Constellation’s eyes.

The constellation was dazzling, and it was beyond any description. Standing before it, Lin Yun could feel how tiny he was, making him panic because he could feel that his soul was about to be devoured by that pair of eyes. “What’s going on?”

Right then, a soft bark echoed in his ears, pulling him back to reality. As Lin Yun swayed his head, he saw Jiang Ling looking at him with a playful smile. The Azure Dragon Lord asked, “What did you see?”

“The Azure Dragon.” Lin Yun replied.

“Your soul left your body earlier, and what you saw weren’t illusions. There are no longer any restrictions on this umbrella. When you activate it, the Azure Dragon Constellation will be able to see you, and vice-versa.” Jiang Ling explained. “Any sovereign saint artifact requires the acknowledgment of the constellation itself, or you won’t be able to borrow the constellation’s power.”

Lowering his head to look at the umbrella, Lin Yun said, “That means that even if I don’t purposely try to summon the constellation, I can still borrow the power of the Azure Dragon Constellation?”

“That’s right. The most straightforward display will be the control over thunderstorms and the Azure Dragon Constellation’s dragon aura. Then again, being observed by the Azure Dragon Constellation might not be good, and you probably sensed it earlier. Even if it had no ill intentions against you, you’d be devoured by it if you’re not careful, just like…” The Azure Dragon Lord briefly paused before he continued, “Just like how you step onto ants when you walk. You have no intention to kill them, but your existence alone threatens them.”

Lin Yun’s excitement turned to caution when wielding the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella. This was the true power of a sovereign saint artifact, and its existence alone was dangerous to weaklings. If he wasn’t careful, he would lose his life.

“I’ll keep it in mind.” Lin Yun nodded. He knew what Jiang Ling was trying to tell him.

“Oh, right. If there are only ten divine artifacts in the Kunlun Realm, what grade is the Firmament Saint Cloth you gave me?” Lin Yun asked.

“Why ask me when you already have an answer in your heart? There are two special traits about it. One is that it can only be possessed by the Dragon Gate Lord, and it was left behind by Lord Ancestral Deity. I heard that it wasn’t something that belonged to the Kunlun Realm.” The Azure Dragon Lord smiled.

Lin Yun was shocked when he heard that because the origin of the Firmament Saint Cloth was too great.

“You only have to know that it’s stronger than the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella. So don’t use it unless absolutely necessary.” Jiang Ling smiled.

“I got it.” Lin Yun nodded.

“I’ll give you another treasure, the Thunderstorm Zither. This was given to me by my dao companion in the past. I couldn’t give it away over the years. It might not be considered a divine or sovereign saint artifact, but I heard it was one of the ten saint zithers…” The Azure Dragon Lord’s expression became gentle as he reminisced.

Lin Yun’s face changed when he heard that because he could feel something wasn’t right. It sounded more like Jiang Ling was trying to give out all of his treasures before his death.

“Take good care of it.” Jiang Ling sent the Thunderstorm Zither over.

As Lin Yun received the zither, Jiang Ling asked, “You can take good care of it, right?”

But before Lin Yun could reply, Jiang Ling took out a blue token.

“The Wind God Order?” Lin Yun asked.

“Oh?” Jiang Ling smiled. “You know this? There are many rumors about it. Some say it’s a sovereign saint artifact, but it’s a token of the Azure Dragon Lord. Take this and look for the Nirvana Pavilion in the Heaven Domain’s Unholy Sea. Give it to the pavilion master.”

When Lin Yun received the Wind God Order, the token felt heavy in his hand.

“This is the Wind God Order. If you take it out, the other party will also take out a token called the Thunder God Order. When the two token fuses together, it’ll form into the Divine Azure Order, and those with it will be the new Azure Dragon Lord of my Azure Dragon’s lineage.” Jiang Ling said.

Will I become the new Azure Dragon Lord? Lin Yun was stumped because he wasn’t prepared for that at all. After he came to his senses, he asked, “Big Brother, are you…?”

Jiang Ling smiled before he nodded his head. This struck Lin Yun greatly. Jiang Ling’s soul must be dissipating soon, or he wouldn’t have told him so much. When the Azure Dragon Lord’s body gradually faded, Lin Yun’s face changed, and he stepped forth. “Big Brother!”

“Sit down.” Jiang Ling pressed Lin Yun down and wore a smile. His smile was gentle, but Lin Yun’s heart ached to look at his smile, and he now knew why Jiang Ling gave him the feeling of a big brother. It turned out that Jiang Ling was similar to Big Brother Xin Jue.

“You don’t have to feel sad. Everyone in the world will die, and death isn’t the end of everything. I have never regretted my life, but my dream is far beyond my reach. You can break into the fourth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, and I’ll help you withstand your tribulation before I leave. Azure Dragon is here; no one can take your life, not even heaven!” Jiang Ling laughed while patting Lin Yun’s shoulder.
