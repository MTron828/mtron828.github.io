Chapter 2049 - Tiger, Leopard, Wolf, and Hound

Zhao Wuji’s appearance with his powerful sword aura radiating from him instantly made him the center of attention. But there was a hint of a devilish aura on him, which made everyone uncomfortable.

“Why is he here?!” Everyone was baffled. Everyone from the Eastern Desolation came to Nether Ethereal City for a month, and they naturally heard Zhao Wuji’s name. It was hard for them to hold their front against someone like him.

The Black Plume Palace was a holy land in the colossi in the Northern Ridge, and their position in the Northern Ridge could be comparable to the Heavenly Dao Sect’s position within the Eastern Desolation.

Zhao Wuji was a golden generation genius within the Black Plume Palace, known to be invincible beneath the Quasi-Saint Realm, and had practiced the mysterious Black Plume Sword Canon. Facing the powerful aura he gave off, everyone from the Eastern Desolation took several steps back.

This instantly made Zhao Wuji and his four sword servants wear mocking expressions. The sword servants wore a different mask each: a demonic hound mask, a black tiger mask, a golden leopard mask, and a white wolf mask that looked terrifying.

The four masks were like a seal that fused with the four of them, making the four look weird. The sword servant wearing the demonic hound mask smiled, “Our young master heard that the talented swordsmen of the Eastern Desolation were here, and he wishes to see if you guys are qualified to participate in this Sword Assembly.”

His words immediately grew dissatisfied with the surroundings. They were invited and naturally possessed the qualifications to participate in the Sword Assembly, but Zhao Wuji didn’t place them in his eyes.

“We’re all invited here. So how are we not qualified?”

“The three rounds of tests haven’t even started yet, and you want to represent the Hidden Sword Manor?”

“Since when does the Black Plume Palace have the qualifications to be so cocky?” In reality, talented swordsmen would probe each other during every Sword Assembly to find their potential opponents, but Zhao Wuji simply used an even cockier method.

Zhao Wuji casually found a table and sat down, ignoring everyone as he drank his wine.

“Zhao Wuji, what do you mean by this?” An Ziyun, who provoked Lin Yun earlier, stepped out, walking over to Zhao Wuji with a cold expression.

There were rumors that Ye Qingtian was cocky, but he didn’t notice how Ye Qingtian was cocky. On the contrary, Zhao Wuji was really cocky to disregard them!

“Who’re you?” Zhao Wuji said, looking at the wine in his cup and not glancing at An Ziyun.

“An Saint Clan’s An Ziyun!” An Ziyun said coldly.

“The An Saint Clan can be considered a giant within the Eastern Desolation with Great Saints since ancient times. But it's a pity that they don’t have any talented swordsmen. If the heir of your clan comes here, he might be able to take a few moves of mine. As for you? You’re not even qualified to fight me,” Zhao Wuji replied.

An Ziyun had never suffered such humiliation before, and his face sank. Zhao Wuji even disregarded his entire clan, naturally making An Ziyun furious. He drew his sword, releasing a sword ray that enveloped half the field. He roared, “You’re courting death!”

An Ziyun’s sword vibrated with the might of glory spirits released. It turned out that his sword was a glory saint artifact, and this made everyone’s faces change, releasing their nirvana auras to defend themselves. The power of a glory saint artifact was powerful, especially in the hands of a swordsman. The sword aura would injure them if they weren’t careful, and not even Saint Armor could withstand the power.

“An Ziyun isn’t simple, capable of unleashing one-tenth of the glory saint artifact’s power!”

“It’s no wonder why he dares to provoke Ye Qingtian. It appears that he came prepared.”

An Ziyun flicked his wrist, and a powerful phenomenon appeared behind him. A sea of fire appeared as he unleashed the sword ray, manifesting into a fire dragon.

This merely made Zhao Wuji smile, but he didn’t move as he continued drinking his wine. Just when the sword was about to reach Zhao Wuji, the sword servant wearing the demonic hound’s mask appeared and grabbed onto the sword.

The sword servant’s hand was like a myriad year ice that grabbed the sword, and the fire dragon dissipated, leaving everyone dumbfounded. No one could figure out how the sword servant accomplished this feat.

This immediately made everyone’s faces change as they looked at the demonic hound-masked sword servant, Zhao Quan, with fear in their pupils. Three demonic hound phenomenons appeared behind Zhao Quan, and each hound reached a hundred feet, releasing a powerful aura.

At the same time, an ominous aura swept out from Zhao Quan that made everyone come to their senses. They immediately realized that Zhao Quan possessed the Cerberus Bloodline.

“There hasn’t been any genius swordsmen within the Eastern Desolation after Jian Jingtian, and I have witnessed today that even someone like you isn’t qualified to stand before me. You’re too weak,” Zhao Quan mocked.

The youth wearing the white wolf mask snickered, “Jian Jingtian is nothing. He has self-imprisoned himself and won’t be able to reach the Saint Realm in his lifetime. As for the Sword Sect, it has long declined.”

An Ziyun’s sword was firmly held onto, and his forehead was covered in sweat, trying to break free from Zhao Quan’s hand by circulating his nirvana aura.

Zhao Quan snorted, and a roar came from within his body. After he let go of the sword, his figure disappeared. When he reappeared, his palm fell onto An Ziyun’s chest, shattering An Ziyun’s nirvana aura and leaving a huge hole in his chest. When An Ziyun flew back, he crashed against a stone pillar and fainted.

Zhao Quan returned to where he stood and coldly said, “A piece of trash like you dares to be disrespectful to the young master? It looks like you don’t know how death is written!”

There were many swordsmen within the Eastern Desolation, and they were so shocked that they couldn’t say a word. They were dumbfounded and frightened silly. An Ziyun might not be a swordsman standing at the top of the pyramid, but he could be considered a talented swordsman. He even had records of facing a Quasi-Saint and leaving safely. This immediately made everyone imagine how powerful Zhao Quan was.

Gongsun Yan took a cold breath, his face changing, and hid behind Zhao Yan, trembling in fear. Zhao Yan’s face was also ugly because Zhao Quan was a little too powerful, and he could sense a huge threat coming from the latter. Most importantly, Zhao Quan was only Zhao Wuji’s sword servant and was the weakest.

Lin Yun squinted his eyes. Zhao Quan shouldn’t be so strong. The reason why he could curb An Ziyun was because of his attributes. The phenomenon was an illusion, and he could withstand An Ziyun’s attack because he fused a glory saint artifact into his palm. But because he used an extremely fast movement technique, not many people could detect it.

In reality, Lin Yun didn’t pay attention to Zhao Quan but was looking at the man wearing the white wolf mask.

Zhao Quan looked around, and his gaze was fixed on the Sword Sect’s party. He smiled, “The Sword Sect’s disciples are also here. Don’t tell me you guys think you can repeat the legend from eighteen years ago, right? Sword dao has declined within the Eastern Desolation, and the Sword Sect is nothing.”

“The Black Plume Palace is formidable, but if my Sword Sect’s Flower Burial was still around, all of you would be nothing in comparison!” A cold voice resounded. When Lin Yun turned his head over, he saw that it came from Ye Ziling.

Zhao Quan looked at Ye Ziling and was stunned because of her unique temperament, and the cold temperament she gave off made others feel inferior.

“Flower Burial?” Zhao Quan said coldly, “If he didn’t offend Tian Xuanzi, he might’ve been considered a genius. But he’s nothing but a coward.”

“Flower Burial is nothing. Let’s not mention that there are rumors that he’s dead. Even if he’s still alive, I can easily slap him to death with a palm!” The white wolf mask said coldly.

Ye Ziling raised her brow with flames blazing within her pupils. She wouldn’t let anyone insult Flower Burial. The surrounding atmosphere became cold as Radiant Snow Flowers appeared within her pupils.F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“You want to make a move?” Zhao Quan and the white wolf said in disdain, not putting Ye Ziling in their eyes. But Ye Ziyun and Mu Qingqing quickly stopped her because there weren’t any chances of her winning by facing two opponents by herself.
