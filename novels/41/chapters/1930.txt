Chapter 1931 - Champion

The Dragon Origin Great Saint wanted Lin Yun to maintain a low profile, but it was a pity that Lin Yun’s strength didn’t allow him to. He could easily defeat his opponent even before obtaining the Astral Sword Intent and spending two months in the Three-Lives Realm.

When his attainment in sword dao reached a certain height, the difference in cultivation wouldn’t be that terrifying anymore, and only Wang Yue gave him a slight headache.

Now that he had undergone a drastic transformation, how could he maintain a low profile? Even if he went easy on Qi Yu by not summoning his constellation, it was still tough for him to find an evenly-matched opponent unless he ran into the other candidates with the ‘0’ medals. Thus, Lin Yun easily won three more rounds and didn’t have to summon his constellation.

This naturally made the Saint Elders on the Heavenly Dao Altar to give out praises for Ye Qingtian.

“That Ye Qingtian is really a genius. If he’s in the Tian Group, he might suffer due to the drastic difference in cultivation. But he’ll stand out too much in the Di Group, and it’s not easy to categorize him.”

“With such a high attainment in the sword, he might’ve grasped more than six sword forms of the Divine Firefly Sword.”

“To have such an achievement at the Profound Death Stage, we should make an exception for him to cultivate within the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda to make a breakthrough to the Nirvana Stage as soon as possible.” The flow of time within the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda differed from the outside world, and cultivating there for a year was equivalent to a month in the outside world.

Aside from that, there were also a lot of benefits within the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda, since it was a sacred cultivation ground to begin with. The pagoda was filled with nirvana aura, and the few highest levels were filled with saint aura and natural saint aura. It contained the Heavenly Dao Sect’s secret treasures, cultivation techniques, saint pellets, and unimaginable benefits.

“Martial Aunt Heavenly Jade, what do you think of Ye Qingtian?” A Saint Elder asked, looking at the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint.

Hearing what this Saint Elder said, the Dragon Origin Great Saint opened his eyes to glare at this person, but that person didn’t know and was still looking at the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint.

“He’s a genius. If he can reach the Nirvana Stage, he will undergo a drastic transformation and become a saint in the future,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said. This was a high evaluation that Zhang Yue, Ye Feifan, and Wang Yue didn’t receive.

While the Dragon Origin Great Saint felt depressed and was about to close his eyes, the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint continued, “But there are many uncertainties in the world. Just like the Dragon Origin Great Saint said, there’s a high chance of him falling if he doesn’t change. So he will only have two outcomes: rise like a dragon or fall like a comet. He still needs to be observed. Aside from that, his talent in the sword needs some improvements.”

The Dragon Origin Great Saint unhappily opened his eyes when he heard that.

Right then, the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint looked at the Dragon Origin Great Saint and asked with a smile, “Dragon Origin Great Saint, what do you think of what I said?”

“If it’s only within the Heavenly Dao Sect, all your evaluations are right. But there are many geniuses within the Kunlun Realm, not to mention the Divine Dragon Empire that has flourished for the past three thousand years. Aside from the Eight Ancient Domains, forces like the Hidden Sword Manor, Skysolute City, Blizzard Saint Palace, Myriad Sword Pavilion, and Black Feather Palace contain many genius swordsmen.” The Nether Slaughtering Sword Sovereign continued, “The Sword Emperor established Skysolute City, and his disciples are all monstrous geniuses. The Hidden Sword Manor’s inheritance isn’t weaker than our Heavenly Dao Sect, not to mention that Frost Emperor of the Blizzard Saint Palace. That person is also a genius swordsman, and his attainment in Blizzard Sword Dao is stronger than Yu Qingfeng, in certain factors.”

“The champions of the Heavenly Paths have also grown up. I heard that Gu Xiyan, the champion of the First Heavenly Path, reached the Nirvana Stage two years ago, obtaining the Ancient Lightning Emperor’s inheritance. The champion of the Second Heavenly Path also obtained the Pegasus Inheritance…” The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said.

The moment she said that, the Saint Elders fell into silence. The Nine Heavenly Paths’ champions all shook the Kunlun Realm. Let’s not mention those that the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint mentioned, but Lin Yun, who had been causing a great shock within the Eastern Desolation, was the Ninth Heavenly Path’s champion.

“Aside from that, the Nine Emperors also have their inheritances, not to mention there are also geniuses being produced in the other holy lands.”

“Even within the Heavenly Dao Sect, Ye Qingtian is still inferior to those few,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said. “Don’t be a frog in the well because the world has already changed. When the Blue Dragon Record appears, a grand era comparable to the Golden Era will arrive.”Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

The Saint Elders became quiet because many geniuses had recently appeared within the Heavenly Dao Sect. The sect might seem glorious, but they knew that the Heavenly Dao Sect was no longer the same as it was three thousand years ago, and it was still being determined if they would have a position in the Golden Era.

Ye Qingtian was a genius, but many people were stronger than him within the Kunlun Realm.

Ye Qingtian was the Dragon Origin Great Saint’s disciple. He could say bad things about Ye Qingtian, but wouldn’t allow others to do that. The Dragon Origin Great Saint’s face was ugly as he said, “Who knows the future? But it’s undeniable that Ye Qingtian will rise in the Golden Era, and I saw Yu Qingfeng’s demeanor on him. He will become a Sword Emperor and surpass the Radiant Sword Saint.”

The Saint Elders’ faces changed when they heard that. There was a hidden meaning behind the Dragon Origin Great Saint’s words, which meant Ye Qingtian’s talent was also stronger than the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint, one of the Three Sword Saints.

The other Saint Elders didn't dare to say a word, and they could sense how protective the Dragon Origin Great Saint was. But they all inwardly laughed as they looked at the Dragon Origin Great Saint who was acting as anxious as a child.

On the contrary, the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint merely smiled and said nothing.

The Nether Slaughtering Saint Sovereign stroked his beard and smiled, “He might not even be able to become the champion. As for being comparable to the Radiant Sword Saint and becoming a Sword Emperor? Dragon Origin Great Saint, aren’t you exaggerating it a bit?”

He wasn’t in the position to compete with the Dragon Origin Great Saint before, but it was different now with the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint standing there.

The Dragon Origin Great Saint also stroked his beard and replied, “It’s just becoming the champion. My disciple can easily obtain that. Just watch.”

Unlike earlier, the Dragon Origin Great Saint hoped Ye Qingtian would be more high profile.

“He’ll easily obtain it?” The Nether Slaughtering Saint Sovereign smiled with disdain flashing across his pupils. There was no question that Ye Qingtian was talented, but it was another story about becoming the champion. Amongst the top ten were the Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden, Wang Yue, Zhang Yue, Ye Feifan, and Lin Beitong. All of them were geniuses, and he didn’t think Ye Qingtian could hold his ground against them.

On the other hand, Lin Yun welcomed his fifth opponent. His fifth opponent was an old man who was a hundred years old.

When the old man came on the stage, he cupped his hands together, “Ren Tong of the Upper Nine Peaks!”

“Come on!” Lin Yun replied.

Ren Tong focused on his physique and grasped the Flame Yang Saint Physique. He practiced the Metal Fusion Saint Canon, refining many precious metals. This meant he was a formidable opponent and should be able to force out Lin Yun’s trump cards.

But in just ten-odd exchanges, sparks flew around Ren Tong’s body. Although Lin Yun’s attacks might not have injured him, his sword intent had infiltrated Ren Tong’s body, causing damage to his internal organs. He yelled, “Stop! Stop! I admit defeat!”

Ren Tong looked at Lin Yun and sighed, “If I was fifty years younger, I wouldn’t have let you win so easily.”

Lin Yun nodded his head and believed what Ren Tong said. But it was undeniable that Ren Tong’s vitality had declined with aging. Ren Tong suffered no injuries and could still last a long time with his physique.

If Lin Yun didn’t use the Astral Sword Intent, he might not have been able to inflict severe injuries on Ren Tong, even with three thousand attacks. But Ren Tong had long lost his motivation, and it had become useless even if he had a powerful physique.
