Chapter 1766 – Three-Lives Realm (2)

According to Saint Elder, the size of this lake was related to his cultivation. The lower his cultivation, the wider the lake. If a mortal was pulled into this bottle, this droplet of divine blood would seem like a boundless ocean to them, and they wouldn’t be able to cross the ocean even if they spent a lifetime.

He would refine the divine blood to cultivate the Blue Dragon Skybreaking Art. The Blue Dragon Skybreaking Art was a profound body-refining technique that was difficult to cultivate. If Lin Yun wanted to combine it with his Azure Dragon Saint Physique, it would be much more complex than anything else.

“Big Brother didn’t make it clear, and he only said I must cultivate the Blue Dragon Skybreaking Art to perfection. But the reality is a lot more troublesome, and I have to give it a try to grasp the Azure Dragon Divine Physique no matter what!” A determined look appeared on Lin Yun’s face. Hee was filled with infinite expectations.

The Azure Dragon Divine Physique was a legend, and no one possessed it before. It was a path that no one has accomplished. Even if he only achieved the lesser mastery of the Azure Dragon Divine Physique, it would grant him a physique that was no different from those powerful divine physiques in history or even stronger.

But achieving the Azure Dragon Divine Physique was challenging and only possible with special encounters. This was equivalent to merging two saint physiques into one. He already had his special encounters, the Blue Dragon Bone, Blue Dragon’s Divine Blood, and even the Azure Dragon Lord’s guidance. But even so, it was still unknown if he could grasp the Azure Dragon Divine Physique.

Over in the Ancient Barren Domain’s Profound Sky Sect, Qin Cang had his eyes closed, standing on a lake with a black saint sword in his hand. He recalled his fight with Lin Yun back at the Profound Wither Sea.

Suddenly, he opened his eyes, and his gaze became sharp. When he moved, he disappeared and reappeared a few hundred feet away. When he looked back, the afterimage he left behind moved, turning into Lin Yun’s appearance with the Flower Burial Sword in his hand.

As Lin Yun soared to the sky, he executed the Azure Mountain Beyond The Clouds and Emerald Stars of the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords. Each attack was terrifying, and his sword was the only light source in this world.

But Qin Cang was calm as he suppressed his cultivation and swung his sword at the Empyrean Realm.

“Lesser Heavenly Moon!” A moon appeared that blocked Lin Yun’s sword ray. The moon soared into the sky, forcing Lin Yun to retreat.

Fleeting cloud isn’t my will, and ten thousand years with the flick of a finger.

Qin Cang wore a grave expression and took a deep breath before a dazzling golden brilliance exploded from his body.

“Universal Sun and Moon!” Qin Cang executed the Lesser Heavenly Sun and Lesser Heavenly Moon. When the sun and moon fused together, they formed a Yin-Yang diagram. When the diagram opened, the sun and moon appeared from it with meteorites that were like thousands of stars embellishing them. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

When he swung his sword, he managed to block Lin Yun’s sword and even shattered Lin Yun’s afterimage. Even then, a bloodstain was left on his face, with a few strands of his hair having fallen off.

Zhuge Qingyun suddenly appeared and held a strand of hair in his hand.

Putting his sword away, Qin Cang asked, “Senior Brother, how is this sword of mine?”

But Zhuge Qingyun shook his head and replied, “Not very good. This sword technique was used by Lin Yun when he was at the Empyrean Realm, and you still can’t break it yet. If there’s no surprise, I’m afraid his current sword technique isn’t something you can take head-on.”

Zhuge Qingyun was Tian Xuanzi’s prideful disciple and was known to be invincible beneath the Saint Realm. But this title became empty when Jian Jingtian reached the Samsara Edict Realm.

“Is the difference between us that great? If that’s the case, I’ll lose if I compete with him in swordsmanship.” Qin Cang was a little disappointed. Ever since he returned from the Divine Dragon Empire, his mental state and cultivation had undergone a drastic transformation. He was far stronger than before, but he still couldn’t fight with Lin Yun in terms of sword dao alone.

“Well, it’s fortunate that I no longer practice the sword.” Qin Cang’s hands emitted a terrifying sharpness, far surpassing any sharp weapon, and he snapped the black saint sword into two.

Looking at this, Zhuge Qingyun was surprised, and verified, “The Golden Dragon Saint Physique? Are you sure you want to take the path of becoming a saint through your physique? This path won’t be easy.”

“The Golden Dragon Saint Physique is just the beginning. In terms of sword dao, I won’t be able to surpass Flower Burial Lin Yun in my lifetime, and I won’t be able to stand out as long as he’s around.” Qin Cang indifferently replied. “Senior Brother, why have you come to look for me?”

“I just received news that this year’s champion on the Nirvana Banquet is someone by the name of Lin Xiao. He appeared out of nowhere and even defeated a descendant from one of the Ten Musical Clans. He even made the Three-Lives Tree bloom; something no one could accomplish for the past thousand years.” Zhuge Qingyun said.

“He’s imposing. His music dao cannot be underestimated, but what does that have to do with me?” Qin Cang said, losing interest.

“What if he possesses the Azure Dragon Saint Physique and even grasped the Quasi-Heavenly Dome Sword Intent?” Zhuge Qingyun said slowly.

Qin Cang’s expression froze when he heard that. He began to murmur, “That’s impossible. Music dao isn’t something that can be achieved in one day. How can Lin Yun possibly be the first on the Nirvana Banquet and defeat all the music dao geniuses in the world? Not to mention he still dares to show up publicly. Shouldn’t he be in hiding, instead?”

“I also think it’s unlikely that he will appear so openly. His identity was verified by the Heavenly Origin Mirror of the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion, but we have to be cautious about this. Recently, the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea isn’t calm, and there is a lot of commotion at the Black Tortoise Void Sea. There are a lot of Dragon Pulse Realm experts, and even if Lin Xiao isn’t Lin Yun, you can go there to join the fun.” Zhuge Qingyun sighed.

“I won’t be going there. There’s no meaning in the Dragon Pulse Ranking.” Qin Cang shook his head. If he was still first on the Empyrean Ranking and hadn’t been defeated by Lin Yun, he might go for the title as first on the three rankings. But there was no longer a need for that now.

“I want to go into seclusion to reach the Samsara Edict Realm. The Blue Dragon Record is my battleground!” Qin Cang said firmly.

“But what if he is Lin Yun?” Zhuge Qingyun asked.

Hearing that, Qin Cang became speechless and was unable to answer.

With a sigh, Zhuge Qingyun said, “You’re still afraid of Lin Yun in your heart, and you can’t bear losing to him again. With your current mental state, it’s useless even if you reach the Samsara Edict Realm.”

He disappeared when he was done, leaving Qin Cang alone to ponder.

Having his sore spot rubbed with salt, Qin Cang’s face was gloomy. Waving his hand, a fragment of the saint sword he shattered flew to his palm, and his entire hand turned golden. He kept kneading the fragment until it was crushed to powder.

His expression was constantly changing on his face, becoming distorted and hideous. After the fragment was crushed to dust and blown away by the wind, Qin Cang’s expression finally calmed down.
