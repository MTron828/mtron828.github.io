Chapter 1289 - Riding on an Azure Dragon to Defeat Transcendents

This scene exceeded everyone’s expectations because no one expected that Lin Yun would be the one charging towards Bai Luli. After all, Lin Yun was only at the Galaxy Stage, and his opponent was a transcendent genius at the Elysium Core Realm!

This was simply too unbelievable, and they couldn’t imagine that something so rare was taking place right before their eyes. It wasn’t rare to see transcendent geniuses in the Empyrean Realm killing lesser Elysium Core Realm experts. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Even an idiot could tell that Lin Yun was a transcendent genius, but his opponent was also one. Not to mention that his opponent has reached the Elysium Core Realm and was the Chief Disciple of the Flame Dragon Sect, ranked within the top hundredth on the Empyrean Ranking.

With such a huge gap in their cultivations, they couldn’t believe that Lin Yun actually decided to face Bai Luli head-on when he hadn’t even manifested his constellation.

“Holy shit, this is too insane!”

“Just where did this monster come from? The Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect? What the hell is that place?” The audience had their jaws dropping when they saw this scene.

“You’re playing with fire!” Bai Luli’s face was eerie and flew towards Lin Yun. Just like that, the battle between the two broke out and they had exchanged over ten-odd moves in the blink of an eye.

The sky was radiated with flames, making it look as if the sky itself would collapse. Right at that moment, Lin Yun flew out from the phenomena and instantly killed another Flame Dragon Sect disciple.

“How dare you! I’ll annihilate your entire sect!” Bai Luli flew into a rage. Lin Yun was too cunning. Even when the two of them were fighting, Lin Yun still didn’t give up on killing the other Flame Dragon Sect disciples. But when he charged forth, it was already too late.

In just that moment, two Flame Dragon Sect disciples had lost their lives before Lin Yun flew towards the youth who initially attacked him first. When his hand reached out, it was like a dragon claw enveloping that youth.

“Senior Brother, save me!” The grey-clothed youth exclaimed in fear.

“Stop!” Bai Luli barked with his eyes becoming bloodshot.

Under the dragon claw, the grey-clothed youth yelled with much reluctance in his pupils. But he still lost his life to Lin Yun.

“NO!” Bai Luli was on the verge of going insane as he kept chasing after Lin Yun.

“This…” The battle had left the audience members dumbfounded while they watched from afar. Lin Yun was disregarding Bai Luli a little too much and hunted the other Flame Dragon Sect disciples.

This wasn’t because Lin Yun was ruthless. But since the Flame Dragon Sect’s disciples wanted his life, then he naturally wouldn’t hold back, either.

Watching as one Flame Dragon Sect disciple died after another, everyone’s lips began to twitch because this was too unreal. Even if the competition on the Profound Wither Island was brutal, the big sects had always been the ones bullying others, and they have never seen the disciples of big sects being butchered in this manner before.

“Bai Luli is too pitiful. I would throw out blood if I were in his position.”

“Killing disciples of the Flame Dragon Sect before him, Lin Yun is too ruthless…”

“How pitiful.” Everyone even felt pity for Bai Luli. He was a transcendent genius, but he was forced into such a terrible state by Lin Yun. Just a moment ago, the Flame Dragon Sect disciples were still mocking that Lin Yun looked like a beggar and that he was only at the Galaxy Stage. But what was happening right now had toppled all their imagination.

“Soaring Jiao-Dragon!” When all the Flame Dragon Sect’s disciples were butchered, Bai Luli was the only one left and he went insane, pushing his constellation to an unprecedented height.

The jiao-dragon at the summit of the golden volcano suddenly began to grow in size before breathing black beams from its mouth. Every single beam had saint runes engraved with blood as they flew toward Lin Yun in the form of shackles that contained a boundless dragon aura.

The shackles soon enveloped the azure dragon around Lin Yun, binding the claws, head, and tail. Bai Luli’s eyes were gloomy when he executed this secret technique. As the shackles bound onto Lin Yun, it forcibly dragged the azure dragon over. Looking from afar, it looked like the jiao-dragon had breathed threads that bound the azure dragon, wanting to drag the azure dragon over and devour it.

This made the azure dragon release a miserable howl as it struggled. When it roared, the thunderstorm energy from the azure dragon made the nine heavens tremble.

“Die!” After binding onto the azure dragon, Bai Luli released his Elysium Core Realm aura, wanting to get close to Lin Yun and kill him. But Lin Yun easily avoided this attack with a flap of his wings. When the shockwave of Bai Luli’s attack swept out, it caused an entire mountain to collapse.

“Dragon Manifestation Soundwave!” Bai Luli unleashed another roar with an ancient flaming dragon rune appearing on his forehead. When he opened his mouth, a soundwave manifested into golden flames that headed towards Lin Yun. When the soundwave swept through, countless mountains were being sliced off.

“With your azure dragon bound, I’ll see what else can you do to face me!” Bai Luli’s eyes flashed with a ferocious light and knocked Lin Yun back with one strike. When he charged over again, his fighting spirit blazed so ferociously that it soared into the sky.

“You’re really annoying!” Lin Yun said. Forty-nine Demonic Astral Flowers suddenly flew from his body, each flower was shining brightly like a miniature sun with flames gloriously blazing. At the same time, Lin Yun’s aura began to violently soar, and he had also broken through the limits of his physique.

He was a rare genius that could only be found once in a millennium who had reached the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm. Many geniuses died trying to reach the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm. But even so, many geniuses still didn’t stop giving their lives for it. After all, if they managed to break through the limit of the martial path, they would have a chance to transcend.

In that split moment when the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm’s phenomenon appeared, this instantly left the audience members’ jaws dropping. But their surprise didn’t affect the battle between Bai Luli and Lin Yun. They were so fast that they looked like they had teleported before the eyes of others, destroying many mountains along the way.

“You, a sinner who killed the disciples of my Flame Dragon Sect. Die!” Bai Luli roared. As ten flaming jiao-dragons manifested behind him, the jiao-dragons flew out when his hands joined together.

This was a terrifying phenomenon. The ten jiao-dragons were like bright suns, lighting up the entire horizon, wanting to devour Lin Yun.

Facing Bai Luli’s attack, a golden crow and silver phoenix flew from Lin Yun’s body. In the next second, the golden crow manifested in the sky while the silver phoenix manifested on the earth. This formed the majestic scene of a golden ocean forming within the sky, spreading a myriad mile radius, and the ground turning into a silver lake that looked like a mirror with a moon reflected on it.

“Divine Solar Lunar Fist—Heaven and Earth Unite!” As a pair of golden wings unfolded behind Lin Yun, the two’s attacks collided together. But the moment they came into contact, the ten flaming jiao-dragons were immediately dissolved.

This made Bai Luli throw out a mouthful of blood, and the power of the sun and moon were wreaking havoc within his body. On the other hand, Lin Yun’s clothes were torn apart with cracks on the dragon runes that were on the surface of his body. If someone looked at him carefully, they would even notice that Lin Yun had suffered some light injuries.

“Is this all a transcendent genius got? You are the Chief Disciple of the Flame Dragon Sect, but you’re really lacking compared to Dugu Yan.” Lin Yun calmly said. He didn’t even have the joy of defeating his opponent on his face. After all, Dugu Yan was someone who was rumored to be invincible in the sword, and he was a lot stronger than Bai Luli.

“How dare you humiliate me!” Bai Luli roared with reluctance in his tone. He couldn’t accept the fact that he was actually being looked down upon by an ant at the Galaxy Stage. He furiously roared, “I’ve not lost yet! I’ll devour your azure dragon!”

The jiao-dragon on top of the volcano was still pulling the azure dragon over.

When Lin Yun looked at this scene, he didn’t look too satisfied. After all, the azure dragon manifested from the Azure Dragon Saint Art still couldn’t be compared to a genuine azure dragon. “Looks like it’s still too weak, and there’s no way it can be comparable to a genuine azure dragon. Well, it looks like I have to strengthen it even more.”

But the audience members who heard his words nearly threw out a mouthful of blood. After all, not only did Lin Yun defeat an Elysium Core Realm transcendent genius while he was only at the Galaxy Stage, but he even wanted to use such a secret technique to be comparable to his opponent’s constellation? Wasn’t that a little too greedy?

“This should be enough.” Light shone from Lin Yun’s forehead and the golden human within his sword ocean formed a seal. The azure dragon sword aura then flew out from his forehead before entering the bound azure dragon. In the next moment, a draconic roar echoed. The azure dragon sword aura gave the azure dragon a soul.

The azure dragon was instantly enveloped in thunderstorms with sword rays surging in its pupils. The shackles on its body also snapped before the azure dragon flew over with sky sword intent and instantly suppressed the constellation.

When the azure dragon flew over, it landed on the summit of the golden volcano and immediately devoured it. When the flaming jiao-dragon was devoured, a painting was ripped apart in the sky.

“N-N-NO!” Bai Luli panicked and threw out a mouthful of blood with his face turning pale before he fell from the sky. When he fell onto the ground, the fragments of his constellation returned to his body. Without any hesitation, Bai Luli used both of his hands and feet to try and flee.

“Hmph!” Lin Yun snorted and landed on the purple-golden azure dragon. Just like that, he pursued Bai Luli while riding on the azure dragon.

“Holy shit!”

“It really devoured the flaming jiao-dragon. Just what’s going on?”

“How is this possible? How did that azure dragon manage to tear apart a constellation…?” The audience members were left baffled and dumbfounded.
