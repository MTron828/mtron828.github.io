Chapter 1182 - A Swordsman's Pride

Yan Zijing couldn’t be bothered by the humiliation because his sect gave him a mission to get an invitation. When he began to crawl through the hole, Yan Zijing turned around to see that Lin Yun was still standing on the field. This scene of Lin Yun being so aloof made him feel more annoyed, and it didn’t take long until Lin Yun was the only one left standing.

“Miss, that person hasn’t moved.” The maid said while pointing at Lin Yun with the whip.

“Hmph. I like to deal with tough bones like him the most. If he doesn’t crawl, then I won’t let him even enter my doors, not to mention obtaining an invitation!” The little miss of the Feng Clan spoke with her eyes squinted. She looked adorable when she smiled, but her thoughts were vile and disgusting.

Without any warning, Lin Yun soared into the sky while crimson saint runes bloomed in the Azure Dragon Seal. With a physique comparable to a saint artifact, Lin Yun punched a hole in the barrier and left the field.

This scene left everyone dumbfounded while the little miss of the Feng Clan became angry. This scene made her gnash her teeth furiously.

Meanwhile, Lin Yun pierced through the barrier like a sword. When he swept his glance forward, he saw several people who crawled out of the hole looking at him in admiration. Yan Zijing was the last to crawl out of the hole, so he was dumbfounded that Lin Yun arrived before him.

“H-How did you come out?” Yan Zijing asked in disbelief.

“What has it got to do with you?” Lin Yun looked at Yan Zijing indifferently and ignored him. But this made Yan Zijing even more furious that someone in the Heavenly Soul Realm dared to be disrespectful to an empyrean like him. If this wasn’t the Feng Clan’s manor, he would’ve taught Lin Yun a lesson a long time ago.

“Follow me!” The maid appeared once more and led everyone towards an elegant room. In the room, the little miss of the Feng Clan was already seated. When everyone came in, they fell to one knee and flattered her before offering their gifts.

The gifts they offered were extremely precious. There were third-grade saint pellets, thousand-year old fruits, expensive pieces of jewelry, and even a bizarre flower. The flower was gifted by Yan Zijing. None of the treasures could catch the little miss' attention except for the flower by Yan Zijing.

The change in her expression made Yan Zijing rejoice as he quickly spoke, “Third miss, this is a rare Silver Needle Rose, and it requires a millennium for it to become the perfect shade of purple.”

“I guess it’s alright!” The little miss of the Feng Clan took a few petals and crushed it, looking at the gorgeous petal fragments. Just like that, the Silver Needle Rose that required a millennium to bloom disappeared in her hand. This scene made Yan Zijing’s lips twitch, but he didn’t dare to utter a single word.

“What about you? What have you prepared for me?” The little miss of the Feng Clan looked at Lin Yun with a cold light flickering across her pupils.

Sensing the killing intent emitting from her, Lin Yun frowned because he didn’t think that such a young girl would have such an intense killing aura. He had long seen that the little miss of the Feng Clan was just messing with them and that she had no intention of giving them the invitation.

Just when Lin Yun took out a box and was about to take a step forward, the maid flashed her whip and barked, “Why aren’t you bowing upon seeing our little miss?”

“It doesn’t matter. Let him come over. I’m very interested in his gift,” smiled the little miss of the Feng Clan.

When Lin Yun stepped forward and opened the box, he revealed a silver bracelet flickering with a dazzling silver light. The bracelet looked exquisite. The bracelet was forged with ice that emitted a bizarre light under the sunlight that made it look like a soaring ice phoenix.

This was something that Lil’ Purple had refined last night, which she ensured that the little miss of the Feng Clan would be interested in.

Upon seeing the bracelet, the little miss of the Feng Clan’s eyes lit up. She quickly took the bracelet in her hands and toyed with it. Furthermore, she wasn’t the only one praising the bracelet because the maids were also taken aback. “What a gorgeous bracelet.”

This scene instantly made the faces of Yan Zijing and the others change. But right at this moment, the maid from before mocked Lin Yun, “I didn’t expect that a mere Heavenly Soul Realm like you from somewhere like the Profound Azure Manor would be able to give something that catches my miss' attention.”

“I’ll take the invitation now if she likes the gift,” said Lin Yun. His words instantly silenced the room and made the atmosphere turn weird. The swordsmen were shocked by Lin Yun’s bold words. They couldn’t believe that Lin Yun was courting death.

The little miss of the Feng Clan who was smiling earlier instantly turned cold as she looked at the bracelet on her waist and said, “You’re really bold. You want to participate in the Sword Assembly held by my family and you dare to speak to me in this manner? The fact that you dared to injure my beloved dog is already enough to grant you death, but you still want the invitation?”

She then put on a mocking smile and continued, “You want the invitation? Sure, beg me!”

This scene made the eyes of Yan Zijing and the others flicker because this was an opportunity for them. They didn’t think that there was anything wrong in kneeling to receive the invitation.

But Lin Yun merely glanced at these people and knew why they couldn’t obtain an invitation. After all, none of them had the pride of a swordsman, and they couldn’t be called a swordsman regardless of how talented they were.

“Not going to kneel? Dig his eyes out and pull out his teeth!” The little miss of the Feng Clan spoke coldly. The maid from before immediately charged forward. She was young, but her cultivation was in the Astral Stage. She didn’t bother using her saint artifact because Lin Yun was only in the Heavenly Soul Realm. As she sneered, she appeared before Lin Yun, “You lowly slave!”

But just when she was about to raise her hand, she noticed that Lin Yun was already gripping her wrist like a dragon. No matter how hard she tried, she couldn’t break free of Lin Yun’s grasp. Furiously, she yelled, “Let me go, you lowly slave!”

When Lin Yun let go of her, the maid emitted a terrifying killing aura and charged at Lin Yun. But the sword cocoon in the center of Lin Yun’s brows twitched, and Lin Yun condensed his sword intent into his eyes. At such a close distance, the eyeball of the maid exploded, causing the maid to collapse and roll to the ground, “My eyes!”

Her scream made everyone feel a chill run down their spine, but Lin Yun wasn’t done. He stepped forward and sent the maid flying with a kick. His body was comparable to a saint artifact after attaining the Azure Dragon Saint Physique, so one could imagine how strong his kick was. Just like that, the maid was sent flying away like a ragdoll, creating a hole in the wall while her bones were shattered.

“If you’re not willing to give me the invitation, give me back the bracelet!” Lin Yun started to walk towards the little miss of the Feng Clan.

“Stop him!” The little miss panicked and yelled. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

As the other maids all charged toward Lin Yun, he sent them all flying with a slap. As he continued to walk toward the little miss of the Feng Clan, her face turned pale as she yelled, “D-D-Don’t come over here!”

But just when Lin Yun was about to approach her, he suddenly stopped because he sensed a terrifying aura locking onto him. It was an expert in the Dragon Pulse Realm, but Lin Yun merely sneered inwardly. He wouldn’t mind if that expert made a move against him since he also wanted to see how terrifying the Firmament Battle Cloth was.

“Young lad, let’s put a stop here.” The Dragon Pulse Realm expert transmitted his voice to Lin Yun.

Stop here? Lin Yun had no intention of stopping here as he looked at the little miss who was hiding in a corner. “You better give me back the bracelet before I leave Azure Rock County. Otherwise, no one will be able to save you.”

When he was done, Lin Yun turned around and left, ignoring all the so-called ‘swordsmen’.

“You want to come and go as you wish? Who do you think you are?” Yan Zijing jumped up and pushed his palm towards Lin Yun when the latter turned around. A sinister smile was plastered on his face because he was unhappy with Lin Yun. Plus, this was a chance for him to perform for the little miss.

But when his palm landed on Lin Yun’s body, he instantly became dumbfounded. It felt as though he had collided against a huge mountain.

“I-I was just joking with you.” Yan Zijing pulled his hand back awkwardly trying to pretend that nothing had happened.

But Lin Yun raised his head to look at him. As the saint rune in the Azure Dragon Mark radiated, he threw a punch. The punch instantly destroyed all of Yan Zijing’s internal organs, creating a huge hole in his chest. Coughing, Yan Zijing fell to the ground as blood dripped from his lips.

Before he could move, Lin Yun had already stepped on his head. His head was instantly buried into the ground. When Lin Yun was done, he walked away, thoroughly disgusted by this place.
