Chapter 2350 - Unhindered

The commotion was so frightening that Gu Jun and Gu Xing couldn’t bear to take another look. There were at least two hundred swordsmen.

“Damn it... How did this happen...?” Gu Jun frowned.

“Big Brother Jun, the situation doesn’t look good,” Gu Xing shivered.

“They will know how laughable they are after seeing the Divine Clans. Climb the stairs!” Gu Jun and Gu Xing sped up without a hint of hesitation.

Lin Yun’s party wasn’t any slower than the Gu Clan as he released his sword intent to bear the pressure on the stairs.

“What is that fellow planning?” Lin Yun looked at Gu Jun with doubt when he saw the panic on the latter’s face. After all, Gu Jun must have a plan based on what he said earlier, not to mention that Gu Jun didn’t use his divine physique or constellation. So he shouldn’t be running in a panic.

“Big Brother Lin, are we going to let them go?” Ji Zixi also noticed how much Gu Jun and Gu Xing were panicking.

“Climb up for now,” Lin Yun said. He had a feeling that it wasn’t that simple.

A few minutes later, they felt a tremendous pressure upon arriving at the Deity Slaughter Monument. The monument was massive, with ‘Deity Slaughter Monument’ engraved on it. The words were emitting a murderous aura.

“This is the Deity Slaughter Monument?” Lin Yun’s face became grave. He could sense how tiny he was before the monument, and it really did seem to have slain a deity before. This made everyone look at the monument respectfully, and all the swordsmen behind Lin Yun calmed down.

“Flower Burial, you’ve really come!” A voice resounded. It was from Gu Jun, who came over. But compared to his earlier panic, he was calm and aloof.

When Lin Yun looked over, he saw six other figures, each with a golden seal on their forehead. When they opened their eyes, their gazes fell onto Lin Yun, and they were all aloof, like Gu Jun. Behind them, there were close to a hundred cultivators, all looking at the group of swordsmen with disdain and pride.

Lin Yun knew these people were all from the Divine Clans, with a deep relationship with the Gu Clan. They were all at the seventh-stage Saint Lord, and they were only slightly stronger than Gu Jun.

Anger blazed in Lin Yun’s heart upon finally understanding where Gu Jun’s confidence came from.

“The Liu Divine Clan, Wang Divine Clan, Yan Divine Clan, Jin Divine Clan, Wu Divine Clan, and Bai Divine Clan... The Seven Divine Clans!”

“Isn’t this too despicable?”

“So this is why Gu Jun lured Lin Yun over? No wonder he wasn’t willing to admit defeat even after being slapped... It turns out that they’re prepared.” This scene was too shocking and the surrounding swordsmen were stumped. This was a frightening scene when the Seven Divine Clans were together.

But Lin Yun was fearless and furious. He wasn’t a bloodlusty person, and he didn’t take anyone’s life on Heavenly Barren Saint Mountain. He sneered, “What a spectacular scene.”

“Afraid?” Gu Jun sneered. “Nothing would’ve happened if you had handed over a Golden Saint Fruit. Now, you can only leave behind three Golden Saint Fruits, along with your saint origin.”

Lin Yun’s face changed with murderous intent flashing in his eyes.

“Furious? Do you think that a bunch of clowns can confront the Divine Clans? You think too highly of yourself. I have long told you that the Gu Clan wasn’t the only one after your Golden Dao Fruit.” Gu Jun held onto his chin with disdain and contempt.

“So what if you’re a prodigy swordsman? You’re nothing before me, and I can do anything I want as long as I don’t go against the rules of the Heavenly Barren Saint Mountain!” Gu Jun smiled and suddenly noticed that something wasn’t right when he saw Lin Yun’s face.

“Digging out one’s saint origin is also within the rules?” Lin Yun smiled. “I didn’t know how to deal with you before, but now I know.”

Lin Yun was smiling, sending a chill down everyone’s spine.

“Don’t worry. I’m famous for having a good temper, so I will obliged by the rules since I’m here.” Lin Yun squinted with a bright smile.

“Young Master Lin, we’ll help you!”

“Yeah! Swordsmen aren’t afraid!”

“The Divine Clans are too much!”

When everyone saw this scene, they were furious. So what if they were from the Divine Clans? Did that mean that they could bully anyone they wanted?

Lin Yun spread his hands apart and smiled, “Let me do it myself.”

When he stepped forth, the seven leaders of the Divine Clans looked at him coldly.

“One against seven? Do you think that the Divine Clans don’t have any temper?”

“Let’s go!” Gu Jun roared and charged at Lin Yun. The other six also didn’t hesitate and flew over. They were all influential figures from the Divine Clans and were all seventh-stage Saint Lords.

Lightning began to rumble in the sky as they activated their deity bloodlines with a terrifying pressure enveloping the surroundings.

“He’s finished...” Everyone didn’t expect the seven from the Divine Clans to be so strong, and their pressure was enough to suppress Lin Yun.

Lin Yun’s sword intent was powerful, but he was only a sixth-stage Saint Lord. He might be able to fight three, but fighting seven was a pipe dream. But facing this situation, Lin Yun was unprecedentedly calm as he reached out, executing the Azure Dragon’s Grasp. The Azure Dragon Divine Rune poured into his palm and a thunderstorm began to rumble.

But that wasn’t all. A dao flower appeared behind him. A golden lotus, which represented the Azure Dragon Dao, bloomed and released a radiance comparable to his Sword Dao. A dragon’s claw descended, enveloped in the power of divine runes. When the claw of the azure dragon descended, it tore apart the clouds, leaving behind cracks in the path of the claw, and destroying the aura formed by the seven geniuses of the Divine Clans.

“What’s going on?”

“The Dragon Clan’s martial technique?”

“Go at him together!” The seven were surprised before they executed their martial techniques at the dragon’s claw.

Lin Yun raised his hand and formed a seal, circulating the Great Profound Sword Canon and Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon with the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron rising within his violet palace.

“Azure Dragon Reversal!” A vortex appeared from Lin Yun’s palm as a suction force swept the seven attacks over, forcing the seven to retreat. Lin Yun wore a smile, and he took a step forth, “Divine Clan? How mighty.”

He might be smiling, but the chill in his eyes was terrifying.

The Liu Divine Clan’s Liu Aohan coldly said, “Lin Yun, don’t blame us for bullying you. You will be targeted since you stood out. If we don’t suppress you now, what will we do in the future? There are only ten quotas, but the actual quotas are only a few. If we can’t suppress you, we will have no chance!”

“The reason is really straightforward, and I can’t refute that,” Lin Yun smiled.

“Good that you know! Hand over the Golden Dao Fruits and back off from the test. We won’t make things difficult for you,” the one from the Wang Divine Clan said with a smile.

“Why waste time with him? Just suppress him! Don’t tell me that you guys are afraid of him?” The Bai Divine Clan’s Bai Wuhen said pridefully. The seven hovered in the air with a seal shining on their foreheads, making them look noble.

“Let’s go! He won’t be able to execute too much of that dragon clan’s martial technique!” Everyone felt their blood boiling as their deity bloodlines began to boil. When the auras they gave off combined, it became so terrifying that the Deity Slaughter Monument began to tremble.

The aura made Lin Yun’s hair flutter, and even his sword aura showed signs of collapsing.

The seven wore a smile. Lin Yun was just a prodigy swordsman. How could he confront the deity bloodlines?

Right then, something unexpected occurred. Sword intent began to clash within Lin Yun’s sword sea. In the next second, sword intent began pouring out from Lin Yun’s pores, which sent the seven of them flying away with blood dripping down their lips.

“What’s going on?”

“His sword intent changed!” The seven of them were surprised and were stumped when they raised their heads. Lin Yun was enveloped in golden flames as his figure stood upright like a sword. He was like a bright sun, and the sword aura he gave off made everyone’s eyes sting.

“Quasi-Bright Sun Sword Intent!”

“H-How is this possible?!” Everyone from the Divine Clans was shocked. The Bright Sun Sword Intent was the eighth-grade sword intent, and even Great Saints would have trouble grasping it. So they couldn’t believe that someone from a barbaric realm could actually grasp it.

“Don’t hold back!” Bai Wuhen roared with a vicious light flashing in his eyes.

“Divine Desolation Cauldron!”

“Divine Starbreaking Sword!”

“Primordial Flame Seal!”

“Dragon Slaughtering Sword!”

The seven brought out their Glory Saint Artifacts or treasures from their clans, pushing their divine physiques to the limit. But just when they wanted to make a move, they heard a voice in their ears, “Three thousand Greater Daos, but only the Sword is supreme!”

Lin Yun opened his eyes and charged forth. But what was even faster was the Flower Burial Sword that flew out from his chest, with Lin Yun following behind. Flames were blazing within Lin Yun’s eyes and he became unhindered with his sword.Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))
