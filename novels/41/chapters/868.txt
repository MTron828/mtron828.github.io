Chapter 869 - Don’t Run Around At Night!

Sword intent was Lin Yun’s greatest weapon, not to mention that his sword intent consisted of spiritual sword intent, immortal intent, and azure dragon sword aura. With the three combined, his sword intent could suppress other martial intent in the second pinnacle stage.

After making a breakthrough in his Azure Firmament Sword Sutra, Lin Yun started moving around in the room. There wasn’t any space in the room for him to execute his martial techniques, so all he could do was practice his Dragon-Tiger Fist slowly. The Dragon-Tiger Fist was naturally insufficient for him, but when he practiced it, the origin energy within his body started surging. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

As long as he unleashed a wisp of it, it was enough to turn the entire house into dust as well as everything in a thousand meter radius. However, Lin Yun had superb control and didn’t leak any traces of his strength.

His slow movements manipulated the air in the room, which made the air circulation dense. If one looked clearly, they could sense that the air was pure astral energy. The astral energy was extremely pure and contained violent energy.

Lin Yun’s movements might look like that of an old man, but his body was full of boundless energy. As the origin energy in his body surged even more violently, dragon runes squirmed all over Lin Yun’s body.

When the astral energy filled the entire room, Lin Yun took a deep breath. All of the astral energy entered his body and headed for his violet palace. In this short moment, Lin Yun made more improvements in his Azure Firmament Sword Sutra. To him, the Heavenly Path was simply a treasure.

“It’s time to temper my sword technique,” said Lin Yun. His spiritual sword intent had long reached the pinnacle of lesser mastery and it was time to reach greater mastery. Although it wasn’t easy to cultivate sword intent, Lin Yun could still make improvements based on his comprehension so far. If there was nothing to assist the tempering of sword intent, one would have to depend on their sword sutra, sword technique, and fighting experience.

At this point, his Azure Firmament Sword Sutra reached the seven stage while his Azure Firmament Thirteen Swords reached the sixth form. All that he was lacking was a fight. But relying on his two improvements as well as his comprehension from the Dragoncloud Treasury was enough to reach greater mastery in the spiritual sword intent.

His spiritual sword intent ultimately needed a transformation to become stronger. Lesser mastery could only bring out 30% of his spiritual sword intent. But once he reached greater mastery, he would be able to unleash 70% of his spiritual sword intent. Then again, he still couldn’t be too anxious as he was facing a decent bottleneck.

“It’s fine if I can comprehend it without the astral pellets.” Lin Yun’s eyes were calm and he unleashed his sword intent in the room. However, his movements were careful and his sword intent only fluctuated in the room. From the outside of the stone house, it looked like nothing was going on.

As time passed, Lin Yun’s strength grew swiftly. As for the rest, they weren’t feeling good because they were focusing on refining astral pellets to leave the city. It was easy to imagine how torturous it was to be in a treasured land and unable to cultivate.

As for Yu Haotian, he was rather relaxed. He refined the astral pellets without showing any signs of panic.

“This is a really good place. My cultivation has grown double of what it was seven days ago. I easily managed to reach the third stage of the Lesser Phaseless Demonic Art you gave me,” muttered Yu Haotian to himself.

When he finished, a weird laughter sounded out in his mind, “Hehe, this is nothing. This is just the border of the Heavenly Path. When you reach the Kunlun Realm, you’ll realize how brilliant the world is.”

This was the demonic spirit that the Indigomoon Elysium gave to Yu Haotian. The spirit was also Yu Haotian’s greatest trump card against Lin Yun. When hearing about the Kunlun Realm, Yu Haotian’s eyes lit up while his tone became grave, “The Heavenly Path won’t be easy. The border has already proved to be troublesome because of the Flamecloud Realm. It won’t be easy for me to reach the end.”

“With me around, how will you lack opportunities? You’re the only one able to succeed in summoning my seed. Before you appeared, 99 people died. Since you’re able to accept my descent, you won’t have an ordinary fate,” sneered the demonic spirit.

Yu Haotian’s eyes flashed coldly because he recalled how dangerous it was to summon the demonic spirit when he had just reached the Heavenly Soul Realm. His body nearly exploded from the intense pain, which furthered his obsession to take revenge.

He couldn’t forget how he was defeated and humiliated by Lin Yun. So he was determined to take revenge against Lin Yun to cleanse his humiliation.

“Leave after you’re done with this. Fang Shaoyu’s group is useless to you. You’re ultimately still too weak and you’re not strong enough to obtain the opportunities here,” said the demonic spirit.

“Indeed, it’s time to leave,” said Yu Haotian. “Tomorrow is the time the Flamecloud Realm group will collect Astral Pellets. But before leaving, I have to kill someone!”

“I suggest you give up for now.” The demonic spirit’s voice explained, “You’re not his opponent the way you are right now. His talent in swords is terrifyingly high and I can’t see through his cultivation techniques. His limit in the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm far exceeds your imagination, so you better not reveal any killing intent before you’re strong enough.”

Listening to those words, Yu Haotian remained silent.

Lin Yun opened his eyes as his pupils shined brightly. His spiritual sword intent had formed seven vortexes behind him. If the phenomenon exploded, half of the city would light up.

“My spiritual sword intent has finally reached greater mastery.” Lin Yun let out a breath as he stood up. When he breathed out, his entire body felt lighter as if it had been cleansed.

Lin Yun spread his hand apart as the seven vortexes landed in his palm. When he clenched his fist together, Lin Yun could sense boundless sword intent. He was confident that he could heavily injure Fang Shaoyu without using his origin energy. However, Fang Shaoyu could no longer be considered a genius in the Heavenly Path.

“Lil’ Red, let’s go and take a stroll.” Lin Yun was in a good mood since his spiritual sword intent reached greater mastery. Lil’ Red’s eyes lit up as it sat on Lin Yun’s shoulder with a grin.

With a few flickers in the dark, Lin Yun landed on the city wall. Through the barrier, he could see darkness enveloping the land outside as the demonic aura in the clouds had descended. Occasionally, ferocious roars would sound out, leaving many people shocked.

Looking outside the city, Lin Yun muttered, “With my spiritual sword intent at greater mastery, the demonic aura won’t be able to affect me.”

Sword intent was the bane of the demonic aura, not to mention that his sword intent still contained the Immortal Azure Dragon Aura. So he could easily resist the demonic aura’s influence with just his origin energy. If he was willing, Lin Yun could leave now because tomorrow was the day that Tang Yan and the others would collect the astral pellets.

“Are you tired of living to barge into the forbidden zone?” Right at this moment, a roar sounded out as a black figure threw a punch at Lin Yun. The power behind the punch was terrifying and it flew like a bolt of lightning.

With the punch flying over, lightning began to crackle in the horizon. No matter how one looked at it, the person wasn’t inferior to Fang Shaoyu in any way. However, Lin Yun didn’t move. Instead, Lil’ Red brandished a claw at the punch.

With a huge explosion, the person who attacked Lin Yun groaned and took several steps back. When he retreated, he looked at Lil’ Red with shock, “A cat?”

As urgent footsteps sounded out, the Flamecloud Realm’s group came over with Tang Yan leading the way. The youth who attacked Lin Yun smiled and pointed at Lin Yun, “Brother Tang, I discovered this brat trying to escape.”

But Tang Yan couldn’t be bothered with that person because his gaze was on Lil’ Red. Lil’ Red’s ferocious aura was enough to make him feel terrified. But soon, Tang Yan’s eyes lit up because he recognized this cat. It was a Dragon-Blooded Cat.

“Come back,” said Lin Yun.

Lil’ Red dispersed its aura before landing on Lin Yun’s shoulder like a bolt of lightning. Sitting on Lin Yun’s shoulder, it looked at Tang Yan and the others coldly.

“Friend, don’t wander around at night.” Tang Yan’s gaze fell onto Lin Yun with a playful smile. The geniuses of the other realms were livestock in the eyes of the Flamecloud Realm. They weren’t even qualified to be their stepping stone in the Heavenly Path.

Lin Yun turned around without showing any expression. Looking at this scene, the youth who suffered a loss at the hands of Lin Yun spoke out, “Brother Tang, we’re going to let him go just like that? He clearly has no intention of handing over astral pellets to us and wants to escape!”

Tang Yan sneered, “I’m letting him go on purpose. He’s just a piece of trash in the Profound Amber Realm. He’s just an ant in my eyes. I know that there will be issues tomorrow, so I’ll let him go until then.”

And then, I’ll subdue his Dragon-Blooded Cat!
