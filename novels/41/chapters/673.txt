Chapter 674 - Trouble

Lil’ Red whined for a little before it stretched its neck out and looked at Lin Yun pitifully with watery eyes. This made Lin Yun’s cheeks twitch as he put away the Frost Moon, “Go. Go.”

The moment Lin Yun said that, Lil’ Red got back on its feet with a goofy smile and ran off. This made Lin Yun sneer in disdain inwardly. It looked like he couldn’t depend on Lil’ Red.

Then again, he wouldn’t be willing even if Lil’ Red was willing. Blood essence was a demonic beast’s foundation. Although a drop wouldn’t harm Lil’ Red’s life, it would still greatly harm its foundation.

It appears that he had to ask around in the Skymound City if there were any demonic beasts with dragon bloodline in the surroundings.

Without thinking much about it, Lin Yun appeared a few thousand meters away and opened the door.

“Lin Yun has come out!”

“He’s really here! Quick, spread the news…” Many people instantly turned to look at Lin Yun in shock. After all, the story of what happened in the auction had long spread out in Skymound City.

When people started to spread the news of Lin Yun’s appearance, it instantly caused an uproar. After all, Lin Yun was someone who humiliated the geniuses of the four major clans and the Skycloud Sect. So it was natural for Lin Yun to attract so many people’s attention when he appeared.

There were many people stationed here day and night, waiting to catch a glimpse of Lin Yun. But Lin Yun wasn’t bothered by the surrounding commotion when he stepped out of the residence. However, with his keen sword intent, he instantly sensed several different killing intents enveloping him.

Before he could even react, a black-clothed elder appeared before him. This old man was in the lesser Yin-Yang stage and had seven people behind him, all dressed in black.

Looking at them, Lin Yun was starting to get annoyed. Seven days had already passed, yet these people were still eyeing him. But Lin Yun wasn’t bothered by them as they couldn’t even catch his attention.

“Attack!” Just when Lin Yun was about to leave, the black-clothed elder smiled sinisterly as he started forming seals while the seven people behind him did the same.

Hmmm? Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly. These people really weren’t afraid of death. Aside from the black-clothed elder who could barely exchange a few moves with him, the others were small fries in his eyes. He wasn’t even interested in making a move against them.

Lin Yun was puzzled and then an immense pressure descended from the sky, enveloping him. It felt as though space had been isolated and not even wind could get in.

A black dot descended from the sky and gradually expanded in everyone’s eyes. When it landed, Lin Yun was able to get a clear look at it. An ancient bell fell from the sky like a prison, trapping Lin Yun.

“It’s the Chen Clan’s Profound Note Bell!”

“Wow, look at that. I heard that the genuine Profound Note Bell is located in the main clan at the Thunder Prefectural City. The seven branch clans have a replica and I heard that each use will exhaust the lifespan of it. I can’t believe they’re actually using it to deal with Lin Yun.”

“No wonder they dare to come to Lin Yun with this formation. So they’re trying to trap him and wait for the true experts to come to kill Lin Yun.”

“Lin Yun shouldn’t have come out. This will be terrible for him once he’s trapped. He will die if he can’t leave.” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“They’ve planned well to take Lin Yun’s life.” When the bell appeared, it was instantly recognized by many people as one of Chen Clan’s secret artifacts. So it instantly caused a commotion. After all, Lin Yun had humiliated the geniuses of the various clans.

Otherwise, why else would they be willing to use the secret artifact? After all, there was a limit to the amount of times it could be used.

In just one moment, the Profound Note Bell descended and enveloped Lin Yun like a mountain. Now, Lin Yun was having difficulty moving since even the air was sealed.

“You want to move around in the Profound Note Bell? How naive!” The old man sneered. But the moment he finished speaking, a dragon roar echoed out from Lin Yun’s body as black cracks began to appear in the air.

Simultaneously, thirty lightning runes began to gather onto Lin Yun’s right fist .When the bell was about to complete its envelopment of Lin Yun, he threw his punch out as a loud buzzing noise echoed from the Profound Note Bell.

Under the soundwave, the surrounding pavilions began to tremble and cracks even started to appear on some of them. As for the seven black-clothed men and the old man, they released a groan as their faces turned pale.

“Suppress him!” The old man roared as the Profound Note Bell that was knocked away descended once again with even more ferocity. A loud sound wave was emitted from the Profound Note Bell, making the surrounding cultivators feel dizzy and their internal organs uncomfortable.

“Again?” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly as forty-five lightning runes began to move.

Azure Dragon Enneaform—Triform!

When Lin Yun clenched his fist, forty-five lightning bolts rumbled like a tidal wave as they surged out and destroyed the soundwave from the bell.

“Break!” An azure figure soared through the sky and punched the Profound Note Bell.

The Profound Note Bell suddenly exploded into countless fragments. All the pavilions within a ten mile radius began to collapse. Along with the Profound Note Bell’s destruction, the black-clothed elder and his men threw up mouthfuls of blood and their faces turned as white as paper.

“My heavens!”

“The Profound Note Bell shattered!”

“How is this possible?! He destroyed it with one punch? He’s like an ancient beast!” Everyone was shocked by this scene.

“Retreat!” The black-clothed elder and his men turned around in panic and began to run for their lives.

“You guys think you can escape?” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly as the Profound Lightning Shuttle flew out, empowered by his xiantian sword intent at complete mastery. In the next second, blood splattered as eight decapitated corpses fell onto the ground and dyed the ground red.

Waving his hand and summoning the Profound Lightning Shuttle back, Lin Yun’s face was extremely cold. It looks like the various geniuses were determined to come after him. Since that was the case, he couldn’t be blamed. The eight lives he took would be a lesson to them.

Right at this moment, sounds of people shuttling through the sky could be heard as Lin Yun could vaguely see Xiang Tianhe’s figure amid the cloud of dust. Accompanying him was Chen Xiong and the other geniuses who were present at the auction.

As Lin Yun’s eyes flickered, he flashed and returned back to the courtyard.

“Damn it!” Chen Xiong cursed when he saw the eight corpses lying on the ground. He was even more furious that the Profound Note Bell that he had gotten with great difficulty had shattered.

“Looks like the Five Acute Lightning Crystals have boosted his strength greatly,” said Xiang Tianhe.

The faces of the other geniuses were ugly as Lin Yun’s improvement was too terrifying. They still couldn’t believe that Lin Yun could destroy the Profound Note Bell with one fist in just seven days.

Initially, they had calculated that even with the xiantian sword intent at complete mastery, it was practically impossible for Lin Yun to break the Profound Note Bell. But they never imagined that Lin Yun could break through the restriction and destroy the sound wave.

“We’ll wait! I refuse to believe that he’ll hide in the Falling Aquatic Residence for the rest of his life,” said Chen Xiong coldly. His face was ugly, which sent a chill down the spine of the spectators.

When Lin Yun turned around, the sword box behind him was buzzing as his xiantian sword intent was accumulating. Before him stood another opponent.

He wasn’t unfamiliar with this person because this person was Luo Yu who held the Death Auction a week ago. The others didn’t know it, but Lin Yun knew that Luo Yu was powerful and was only pretending to be weak.

But Lin Yun was shocked at how Luo Yu came in. As a third grade spiritualist, he knew the restrictions well. The restrictions of the courtyard could even forbid the entry of a Heavenly Soul Realm expert. This was why Lin Yun was confident that the likes of Xiang Tianhe couldn’t get in.

“You seem to be filled with enmity towards me?” smiled Luo Yu. “You don’t have to wonder, I’ll explain. I was the one who rented this courtyard to you, so I can naturally come and go as I wish. I apologize for what you suffered when the various forces made a mess at the auction.”

“Come with me. This is not the place to speak,” said Lin Yun as he glanced at Luo Yu.

“This brat...is interesting…” Looking at Lin Yun’s figure, Luo Yu was briefly stunned before he smiled. He was only somewhat unhappy by how proud Lin Yun seemed to be. But despite what he felt, he still had no choice but to follow Lin Yun.
