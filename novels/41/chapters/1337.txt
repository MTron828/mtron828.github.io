Chapter 1338 - Ancient Martial Stone Tablet

When Qin Cang gave out his orders, the surrounding Profound Sky Sect’s disciples began to spread out.

“Young Master, we’re not done searching this mountain yet…” The few Greater Elysium Core Realm deacons said. They were filled with fear for Qin Cang. Due to their respect for him, they didn’t dare to call Qin Cang by his name.

But Qin Cang immediately interrupted them with a wave of his hand, “Just go and execute my orders. There’s no need to continue searching this mountain, let the other sects go ahead and compete. Did they think that it would belong to them if they obtained it? They’re just a joke. So, what are you guys still standing here for? Go!”

“Yes! Yes! Yes!” The Greater Elysium Core Realm experts immediately acknowledged. Qin Cang might not care about the saint elixirs, but they did. So they couldn’t help feeling a little unhappy after seeing that Qin Cang was ordering them like other disciples. But none of them dared to disobey his orders and could only go and obediently execute them. Very quickly, Qin Cang was the only one left on this mountain.

“Great Saint Origin…” Qin Cang muttered. The Great Saint Origin might be useless for him, but since it was an order from Tian Xuanzi, he would get it, no matter what. In his heart, he didn’t have the Nether Divinity Clan. Only Tian Xuanzi, a person who was like a master and father to him.

Since Tian Xuanzi had asked for the Great Saint Origin to be retrieved, then Qin Cang would definitely obtain it, even if he had to fork out his life. Not to mention that there might be other treasures where the Great Saint Origin was located, and there was no doubt that those treasures would definitely be more precious than the saint elixirs on this mountain.

“Lin Yun, don’t disappoint me…” Qin Cang muttered before he sat down and began cultivating. Circulating the Golden Dragon Bone, a golden aura began to nourish his body, and the golden aura was a lot more powerful than ordinary astral energy. It emitted a majestic and ancient aura. That was the Golden Dragon Aura!

Close to where the blood pool was located in the pagoda, this was a place that those who wanted to enter the depths of the pagoda definitely had to pass by. But if they fell into the blood pool, then even a Greater Elysium Core Realm expert would instantly lose his life.

When Jiang Lichen made it through the mist with great difficulty, he was filled with lingering fear when he saw the pile of corpses. Not long later, a black figure appeared from the mist. It was Lil’ Red, who had been waiting there.

“Thank you.” Jiang Lichen smiled the moment he saw Lil’ Red. If it wasn’t Lil’ Red who waited outside and even reminded him, then he might have lost his life by now.

Lil’ Red raised its head and nodded, looking aloof with disdain in its eyes. Seeing this made Jiang Lichen’s cheeks tremble because he was being looked down upon by a cat. But fortunately, no one else had seen this.

“Senior Brother, you’re being looked down upon by a cat.” Just when Jiang Lichen thought that there was no one around, Liu Qingyan and Feng Zhang walked over with a smile on their faces.

Hearing that made Jiang Lichen’s face turn red and retorted, “You’re telling me that this cat is that intelligent? Furthermore, what is there to look down on?”

“It was left behind by Junior Brother Lin to warn us of the danger. You’re the slowest among us, so it is naturally looking down on you…” Liu Qingyan smiled.

“W-What? Are you serious?” Jiang Lichen wore an awkward expression when he heard that.

Right at this moment, Ye Ziling and Su Ziyao walked over side-by-side. Upon seeing them, Jiang Lichen finally knew that he was, indeed, the slowest out of everyone. This instantly made him embarrassed because he was the senior brother in name.

When Lil’ Red saw Ye Ziling and Su Ziyao, the disdain in its eyes disappeared and became innocent with a fawning smile. This scene made Jiang Lichen’s lips twitch because this cat was really intelligent, now that he looked at it again.

“This cat is pretty adorable.” Even Su Ziyao wore a smile and squatted down to rub Lil’ Red’s head.

Lil’ Red closed its eyes and enjoyed Su Ziyao’s caress. When it was done enjoying it, it suddenly recalled that it had a task given by Lin Yun and began to make gestures with its hands.

Su Ziyao couldn’t understand what it was saying, but Ye Ziling fell into deep thoughts and said, “You’re saying that Lin Yun tasked you to wait here for us and bring us over to him?”

Lil’ Red nodded its head and happily pointed at its nose with its claws.

Seeing this, Ye Ziling smiled, “This cat is pretty smart.”

“But how does it know where Junior Brother Lin is at? There’s no way we can communicate here,” said Jiang Lichen. But Su Ziyao and Ye Ziling didn’t say a word and merely looked at him.

Liu Qingyan finally couldn’t hold back from laughing and replied, “Senior Brother, you’re really stupid. Since the cat pointed at its nose, this naturally means that it can track Lin Yun by his scent. So we just have to follow it.”

Hearing that, Jiang Lichen wore an awkward smile and felt that he should keep his mouth shut in case he embarrasses himself even more.

“Can it be that there’s an issue for Junior Brother Lin to gather us together?” Feng Zhang suddenly asked.

“We’ll know after meeting him,” replied Su Ziyao. Others might not know, but Su Ziyao knew that Lin Yun had the Profound Wither Key. So this meant that Lin Yun had the highest chance to obtain the Great Saint Origin.

But Lin Yun didn’t want to receive all the benefits alone and wanted to take care of these people, he just didn’t inform them beforehand. After all, the Profound Wither Key did not necessarily mean the Great Saint Origin.

Under Lil’ Red’s lead, they headed to where Lin Yun was at. The depths of the pagoda was filled with dangers, and similar places like the blood pool could be found everywhere. If they were careless, they might even get devoured by the pagoda. So there was no way they could increase their speed.

At the same time, the competition for treasures had reached a climax in various mountains. On a mountain in the depths of the pagoda, there were many fated transcendents gathered together. The Thunder Sect’s Zhang Jin, Heavenly Blade Pavilion’s Nangong Ze, Emerald Jade Manor’s Ning Feng, and Azure Thunder Sect’s Dugu Yan have joined hands when facing a bald monk. Their faces were ugly because they couldn’t get any benefits, despite joining hands.

Especially Zhang Jin and Nangong Ze, whose injuries were rather serious. Only Ning Feng was fine, thanks to his ancient armor. Aside from that, the Profound Valley’s Tang Jing and Heavenly Note Sect’s Luo Shuyi were also here because an extremely precious treasure would soon appear here.

The bald monk was the fated transcendent of the Vajra Monastery, Cang Yun. He was laughing with blood dripping down his lips, and his laughter was demonic. He was hugging an incomplete stone tablet with many ancient runes engraved on it.

Behind the tablet, there was an ancient golden crow rune that stood out. With a glance, anyone could tell that this should be an ancient martial technique. Although there was only half of it, it would be a huge opportunity if he could extract it.

After all, the famous Profound Sky Canon was something that was extracted. So who could guarantee that the martial technique recorded on this stone tablet wouldn’t be comparable to the Profound Sky Canon? At the very least, this stone tablet was more attractive to the powerful sects than saint elixirs.

“No wonder you people can’t deal with Flower Burial, even after coming together. It turns out you guys are pretty weak. I have no idea why you guys entered the Profound Wither Island in the first place with your strength.” Cang Yun mocked.

The faces of Nangong Ze and the rest were cold. They didn’t argue with Cang Yun, but merely sealed off his path of retreat.
