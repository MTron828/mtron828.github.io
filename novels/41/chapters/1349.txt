Chapter 1349 - Breakthrough to the Elysium Core Realm

“The Golden Crow Plume Feather…” Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts as he grabbed the plume feather. The weight had far exceeded his imagination and it was even heavier than the Lightning Shadow Sword. One must know that the Lightning Shadow Sword was close to a hundred cauldrons in weight.

If he triggered the divine rune, the weight of it would increase as the power increased. After all, one could imagine how powerful the Lightning Shadow Sword was when he nearly severed Qin Cang’s arm. It might seem like boasting, but Lin Yun already possessed one hundred cauldrons of strength.

Then again, being able to unleash an explosive power of a hundred cauldrons and lifting a hundred cauldrons were two different concepts. At the very least, one needed at least a thousand cauldrons to lift a hundred cauldrons worth of weight. But if one’s physique wasn’t strong enough, they could circulate their astral energy to do so. Otherwise, those cultivators who didn’t temper their bodies wouldn’t even be able to lift a saint artifact.

But what Lin Yun was shocked about was that the Golden Crow Plume Feather was smaller than the Lightning Shadow Sword, but it was a lot heavier in comparison.

“The Golden Crow Plume Feather was where the essence of the body lies, like a dragon’s true bone. Not all of a dragon’s bones can be called the true bone. Only the bone before the chest could be called the true bone that can give birth to the origin saint rune.” Lil’ Purple explained, seeing that Lin Yun didn’t seem to understand the Golden Crow Plume Feather.

While playing with the Golden Crow Plume Feather in his hand, he sensed a sharp piercing aura that was comparable to his firmament sword intent, and it felt natural. If one activated it with astral energy or sword intent, it could be considered a powerful treasure.

“How do you refine this? My firmament sword intent can’t leave behind any marks,” asked Lin Yun.

“You’re really stupid. Don’t tell me that you’re going to eat it. You think refining the Golden Crow Plume Feather is the same as refining saint elixirs?” Lil’ Purple said in disdain.

Lin Yun wore an awkward expression when she said that, since he had no experience.

“Let me give you the Elysium Core Realm portion of the Divine Sunchasing Art,” said Lil’ Purple as she placed her finger before Lin Yun’s forehead.

When Lin Yun closed his eyes, a surge of boundless information poured into his mind. The Elysium Core Realm portion was the true beginning of the Divine Sunchasing Art. The Violet Palace Realm and Heavenly Soul Realm portions were just entry-level. The Violet Palace Realm and Heavenly Soul Realm portions were considered the foundation before cultivating the Golden Crow Seal to manifest the Golden Crow Wings. A brief moment later, Lin Yun suddenly opened his eyes.

“Understood?” Lil’ Purple asked.

Nodding his head, Lin Yun circulated the Golden Crow Seal and allowed the Golden Crow Plume Feather to hover before him. As he squeezed a droplet of his blood essence from his finger, the blood essence fell onto the Golden Crow Plume Feather. Since he had the Innate Azure Dragon Saint Physique, his blood was glowing with a faint golden light that made it look extraordinary.

When the blood fell onto the Golden Crow Plume Feather and fused into it, fluctuations spread throughout the surrounding space. Some time later, surges of a terrifying aura were being emitted from the Golden Crow Plume Feather.

“Empress, how long do I have to last?” Lin Yun asked in a feeble voice with his face pale. The blood wasn’t a mere droplet of blood, but a droplet of blood from his heart, and every single droplet contained his essence. So every droplet of it represented boundless vitality.

“Almost there…” Lil’ Purple replied because that was the only way she should answer. But the moment she finished, the Golden Crow Plume Feather began to melt into a golden liquid. The liquid was like molten magma at a high temperature and emitted a devastating pressure.

“Back off.” Lil’ Purple pulled Lin Yun and retreated ten-odd steps. As the golden liquid turned into a golden flaming ball, a dazzling light shone like a bright sun in this space.

“Oh my god!” Lin Yun could sense the terrifying aura being emitted from the sun, and he could also sense the vitality coming from the ‘sun’. This made him wonder if the golden crow would come to life.

“Now!” Lil’ Purple yelled. “Remember, when you refine it, you have to unlock the first seal. Not only do you have to imprint the golden crow saint rune on your elysium core, you also have to manifest the Golden Crow Divine Wings. This means that you have to multitask and this is a challenge. But there’s no better alternative.”

If Lin Yun had another origin saint rune, then he wouldn’t have to take the risk to multitask. But he didn’t have a choice right now. Taking a deep breath, Lin Yun circulated the Divine Sunchasing Art with his astral energy, forming the golden crow seal with his left hand while reaching out with his right hand to walk forth.

As he circulated the Divine Sunchasing Art, Lin Yun began to emit astral light from his body, basking him in a bright glow that made him look ethereal.

“Assimilate!” After Lin Yun got close, he tugged with his right hand and the golden ‘sun’ entered his body. The blazing energy was like a flaming dragon made of golden magma as it filled his body.

Lin Yun had no expression on his face as beads of sweat rolled down his forehead. When a golden light shone out from his pores, he felt as though his physique was about to be blown apart. When the golden sun entered his body, Lin Yun sat down and placed both of his hands on his knees.

With a single thought, Lin Yun undid the first layer of the restriction on the Profound Wither Key. In a split second, Lin Yun’s heart blazed with his blood boiling. His body also began to emit a golden glow as every single strand of his hair and all of his blood became golden.

“Lin Yun, quick! Circulate your astral energy to refine this energy!” Lil’ Purple’s voice nervously resounded. Even if it was the first layer of restriction, just one-thousandth of the Great Saint Origin’s power was really terrifying.

When the restriction to the Profound Wither Key loosened, a hole tore open in Lin Yun’s heart. Whenever his heart throbbed, a powerful energy would gush forth and flow throughout his body, flowing towards every single cell. As the astral energy circulated, the power of the Great Saint Origin began to grow within his meridians.

Just like that, Lin Yun’s cultivation was swiftly improving. Under this terrifying energy, the ten saint elixirs that Lin Yun had prepared were of no use. When Lin Yun controlled his breathing to circulate his astral energy, he controlled the magma towards the Golden Crow Seal. At the same time, he also had to extract the origin saint rune, and this meant that he had to focus on three tasks.

Four hours later, Lin Yun’s cultivation reached the peak of Quasi-Elysium Core Realm, and the astral energies in his aura ocean had reached an unprecedented height. The forty-nine Demonic Astral Flowers in his aura ocean also began to shine brightly as they began to devour the Great Saint Origin’s power.

As time gradually passed, seven days passed in the blink of an eye. Lin Yun’s Innate Azure Dragon Saint Physique was constantly growing stronger as the golden magma even dyed his bones gold and purple dragon runes could be seen flickering on the surface of his body.

While receiving the baptism of the Great Saint Origin, Lin Yun’s cultivation was improving and his Innate Azure Dragon Saint Physique was also getting stronger. But Lin Yun felt that something was lacking, like a painting needing a final tough. If he couldn’t find this final touch, then he would leave regrets behind, even if he reached the Elysium Core Realm.

So he began to become anxious as he wondered what was lacking. Suddenly, Lin Yun thought about the Seven Flowers Convergence. He had achieved the Seven Flowers Convergence when he was in the Heavenly Soul Realm, allowing him to have a powerful foundation compared to other Empyreans. Now that he was about to reach the Elysium Core Realm, the demonic astral flowers also needed to take a step further or he wouldn’t be able to make the breakthrough.

“The Demonic Astral Flowers need to take a step further or all my effort in the Heavenly Soul Realm will be in vain.” Lin Yun gritted his teeth and forcibly suppressed his aura from making a breakthrough.

Just like that, three days had passed and Lin Yun’s physique reached a limit. He also began to hover in the sky without anyone knowing with rings of golden light blooming behind him.

Suddenly, a loud sound echoed from Lin Yun’s body with countless flower petals flying out. The forty-nine Demonic Astral Flowers in his aura ocean have shattered at the same time with a domineering power surging out.

As a sacred song suddenly resounded throughout the surroundings, it felt as though someone had broken through the boundary and achieved eternity. In the next moment, the spiritual energy in the surroundings swept over and devoured all the petals.

As the Demonic Astral Flowers began to disappear from Lin Yun’s aura ocean, they regathered in his violet palace and formed into a golden flower with forty-nine petals.

“The Divine Astral Flower!” Lil’ Purple exclaimed. She couldn’t believe that Lin Yun actually managed to allow the Demonic Astral Flowers to transform into the Divine Astral Flower at the Quasi-Elysium Core Realm. But it was still lacking because he didn’t imprint a divine rune on it. Even so, it was still shocking enough.

After the Divine Astral Flower was formed, it would only refine and strengthen his astral energy, it could also strengthen his physique.

An hour later, boundless astral energy charged from his violet palace and formed into a golden pellet. When the golden pellet was formed, Lin Yun could sense his sword intent, martial comprehension, and all his cultivation techniques flowing towards the golden pellet.

When the elysium core was formed, Lil’ Purple’s breathing became nervously hurried. She yelled, “Lin Yun, the origin saint rune! Don’t forget the origin saint rune!”

If the elysium core was fixed, then it would be too late. Lin Yun had beads of sweat rolling down from his forehead as heat waves exploded from his body. He was trying his best to control the Golden Crow Seal. If he couldn’t manifest the Golden Crow Divine Wings, then he wouldn’t be able to extract the origin saint rune.

Inwardly letting out a roar, Lin Yun decided to take a risk and all his clothes disappeared. As golden light wriggled on his back, the golden pellet above the Divine Astral Flower in his violet palace was still devouring all his martial comprehension and the astral energy in his aura ocean. Lin Yun could sense that even his soul was about to be sucked in, and the immense pain nearly made him collapse.

About half an incense’s time later, Lin Yun let out a roar to vent out all the pain that he had been bearing. At the same time, a pair of golden wings flickering with a metallic luster and began to grow from his back. In the next moment, the pair of golden wings had grown to nearly twenty meters in length, overshadowing all the light in the world when it appeared.

“Finally!” Lil’ Purple let out a breath of relief. She was so nervous earlier, it was as though she was the one in Lin Yun’s position.Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com
