Chapter 1279 - Innate Azure Dragon Saint Physique

The island occupied by the Sword Sect was one of the islands closest to the Profound Wither Island. It was enveloped in spiritual energy so dense that it had even formed into a mist. Now that a saint elixir was born, this instantly made the island become popular.

On a distant mountain from where the saint elixir was born, there were two figures standing there, emitting terrifying auras as though they had become one with the heavens and earth. If someone else looked in their direction, they would see nothing.

They were both giving off a terrifying sword aura. One of them was Feng Jue, the other was also a Samsara Edict Realm expert from the Sword Sect whose cultivation was higher than Feng Jue. He was a Sword-Bearing Elder of the Sword Sect, Lin Zhen. Sword-Bearing Elders had a high position in the sect, and they had the authority to get involved with the seven peaks aside from the Divine Firmament Peak.

“The commotion caused by your young friend isn’t just big. It’s so like you disciples from the Divine Firmament Peak.” Lin Zhen said with a playful expression.

“That’s for sure,” smiled Feng Jue, who didn’t hear the deeper meaning behind Lin Zhen’s words.

“Haha. Has the Profound Sky Sect discovered his identity?” Lin Zhen asked.

Feng Jue was briefly stunned before he replied, “Not yet. But it’s uncertain once the Profound Wither Island opens. The day will finally come, and there’s no way that brat can hide with his temper.”

“He is, after all, the champion of the Ninth Heavenly Path. No matter how you try, you can never conceal his light. But it’s still too early for him now,” sighed Lin Zhen.

Feng Jue didn’t deny those words because they weren’t false. The current Lin Yun still had a huge gap to fill when compared to those geniuses ranked in the top ten. Otherwise, Lin Yun would definitely come and compete for the saint elixir based on his temper.

Right at that moment, one figure after another began to appear around them, and each of them was emitting a terrifying energy. They were Samsara Edict Realm experts from the other powerful sects. The Heavenly Note Sect, Heavenly Blade Pavilion, Vajra Monastery, and Emerald Jade Manor. The majority of the eight powerful sects from the Ancient Barren Domain were here, aside from the Profound Sky Sect.

It was unnatural that so many Samsara Edict Realm experts would gather for a mere saint elixir.

“The Profound Sky Sect only sent one person over. They’re practically disregarding us…” A silver-clothed man wielding a blade spoke first. The others also swiftly responded with unhappiness and fear for the Profound Sky Sect.

The big sects could only afford to send out one Samsara Edict Realm expert. It wasn’t because they didn’t want to send out more, but it was because their foundation couldn’t be compared to the likes of the powerful sects. The Sword Sect was rather restrained, unlike the other powerful sects who sent out four and were determined to obtain the great saint origin.

As for the Profound Sky Sect, they had only sent out one Samsara Edict Realm expert.

“It’s Zhuge Qingyun who came.” Lin Zhen calmly said, and his words made everyone silent because that person was Tian Xuanzi’s most outstanding disciple, and he had great fame back then.

“That’s because my senior brother isn’t here. Otherwise, he’d have no position here,” said Feng Jue in disdain.

But everyone else had ignored his presence. A middle-aged woman then said, “According to our previous agreement, we won’t interfere in the competition between our disciples. Regardless of who obtains the great saint origin, all of us have to help protect them. It might just be a verbal agreement between us, but I believe everyone will keep to your words, right?”

“The Emerald Jade Manor won’t go against our words.”

“Neither will the Heavenly Blade Pavilion.”

“Monks don’t lie.”

When they were done, all of them turned to look at Lin Zhen. After all, the Sword Sect was a lot stronger than them, and the alliance would be weak without Lin Zhen joining in.

“The Sword Sect won’t go against our promise,” said Lin Zhen.

“That’s great, then.” Not long later, the Samsara Edict Realm experts disappeared as if they had never appeared in the first place.

But Lin Zhen wore a complicated gaze and let out a sigh. When Feng Jue saw this scene, he smiled. “Elder Lin, what are you sighing about? With all five sects joining forces together, the great saint origin definitely won’t fall into the hands of the Profound Sky Sect. So you should be happy.”

But Lin Zhen shook his head and replied, “How many years has it been? The five sects now have to join forces to face the Profound Sky Sect. I can’t imagine how terrifying they will grow in the future.”

Hearing what Lin Zhen said, the smile also disappeared on Feng Jue’s face because it was undeniable that Tian Xuanzi was too strong. After all, he had reached his current achievement in less than five hundred years, and no one else in the Ancient Barren Domain would restrain Tian Xuanzi, aside from his master.

Over the past five hundred years, the Profound Sky Sect had been soaring and showed signs of dominating the entire Ancient Barren Domain. Everyone knew about Tian Xuanzi’s ambitions, and no one knew how strong he would become in just another hundred years. The moment the Radiant Sword Saint could no longer suppress him, there wouldn’t be anyone in the Ancient Barren Domain who could keep him under control.

“Day has come,” said Feng Jue as dawn broke through the clouds. At the same time, the saint elixir was also born and the geniuses from the various forces gathered to compete for it.

“But it’s a pity that brat isn’t here.” Feng Jue shook his head. Even if Sikong Zhou was extraordinary, Feng Jue still felt that something was lacking since Lin Yun wasn’t around.

Two days later, the snowy mountain was enveloped in a terrifying dragon aura with thunderstorms forming in the sky, condensing into a terrifying vortex. however, no one could see this scene because everyone had already left. They were more focused on the saint elixir that appeared two days ago.

But if someone climbed up the mountain, they would see a crimson dragon cocoon. The entire cocoon was made of crimson threads, and there were countless dragon runes imprinted on the surface of the cocoon.

The ground was covered with cracks, and the height of the dragon cocoon reached three meters, emitting an extremely terrifying aura. At the same time, the thunderstorm vortex in the sky was linked with the dragon cocoon with thunderstorm energy being poured into the cocoon.

Inside the cocoon, there was a figure curled up like an infant, and the entire cocoon was emitting a holy and ancient aura. If one looked from afar, the cocoon appeared to contain a dragon within, an azure dragon that would awaken soon.

“It should be about time.” Lil’ Purple muttered while she held onto her chin. The Profound Wither Island was opening, and Lin Yun would miss the chance to enter the island if he didn’t come out now.

Lil’ Purple was also interested in the Profound Wither Great Saint’s inheritance. After all, the Profound Wither Great Saint was someone who was involved with the Life-Death Diagram. If the painting in Lin Yun’s hand was really the Life-Death Diagram, then it would be really unbelievable.

After all, there were many rumors revolving around the Life-Death Diagram back in ancient times. According to the Iris Sword Saint, the Life-Death Diagram wasn’t just a divine artifact but had the entrance to hell hidden within it. Most importantly, she remembered that the Iris Sword Saint said something about wanting to obtain it.

She believed that if the Iris Sword Saint made the move, he would definitely be able to obtain it. But she had no idea why it fell into the hands of the Southern Emperor. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“The Nine Emperors appeared three thousand years ago. Can it be that they’re all related to that Iris Sword Saint brat?” Lil’ Purple’s brows were locked together. Since her features were too flawless, she looked adorable even with her brows locked together.

Just when Lil’ Purple was in deep thoughts, cracks began to appear on the crimson cocoon with dazzling light shining out from the seems of the cracks. When the light shining from the cocoon grew even brighter and reached the limit, the entire cocoon exploded and Lin Yun slowly stood up from his curled position.

He didn’t have any clothes on, and his skin was pearly white, like a newborn. He didn’t have a robust figure, but a perfectly lean figure with his hair casually draped down.

“It hurts.” Lin Yun could feel the sting in his eyes from the sunlight when he tried to open them, but his eyes soon adapted to the light.

“What’s going on…?” Lin Yun was shocked as he examined himself. He discovered that his body was comparable to a newborn, but he could also feel the unbelievable power contained beneath his skin. The current him was at least twice as strong as before he refined the Dragon Blood Fruit. Most importantly, he could feel a faint dragon aura in his bloodline, as though he was born with it.

Suddenly, the words ‘Innate Azure Dragon Saint Physique’ appeared in his mind. In the past, his Azure Dragon Saint Physique was something he had acquired later on, but it looks like it had transformed into an innate physique right now. Although there was only a word difference between the two, the actual difference was a lot bigger.

At this moment, he was completely flabbergasted by this ‘opportunity’ that Lil’ Purple had prepared for him. He could still faintly remember that when he entered the jar, his blood and flesh began to burn off, leaving behind his skeletal frame. At that time, his blood and flesh had perfectly fused with the saint liquid in the jar and were being reforged.

If it was an ordinary person, they would’ve lost their lives a long time ago. It was thanks to the breath of flame from Lil’ Purple that protected his vitality and soul. But when he was done refining the Dragon Blood Fruit, he had completely lost his consciousness and fell into a deep slumber.

“This is…?” Lin Yun’s gaze fell onto the Azure Dragon Mark on his heart and noticed that the saint rune had undergone a drastic transformation. It had been upgraded to a divine rune.

When he circulated the Azure Dragon Mark, purple-golden dragon runes began to appear under his skin and instantly reached a thousand runes. When they gathered together, they looked like an ancient azure dragon coiling on the surface of his body.

When the divine rune blazed, the azure dragon on the surface of his body came to life and flew from his body. As the azure dragon coiled around Lin Yun, the thunderstorm vortex that disappeared earlier reappeared once more with a terrifying dragon aura that instantly made the sky turn dark.

When Lin Yun merely moved his fingers, he could sense that the thunderstorms surging in the surroundings instantly became violent. It felt as if the thunderstorm was completely under his control and he didn’t even need to learn how to use it. It was as though he was born with the ability to do so.

This brought joy to Lin Yun’s face. The saint rune must have been upgraded to a divine rune. He could summon an azure dragon from it, one with blood and flesh under his control. As the azure dragon let out a roar and soared into the clouds, it was emitting a terrifying aura with every single movement, not to mention that Lin Yun could see what the azure dragon saw, it was like another Lin Yun.

“Come back!” With a single thought, the azure dragon returned to his body and his strength began to ferociously rise. The thousand dragon runes then shone brightly.

“The Azure Dragon Saint Art actually reached the eighth stage!” The more he examined himself, the more shocked Lin Yun became.

“Ahem. Do you mind putting on some clothes before showing off?” Lil’ Purple’s voice resounded.

Her words woke Lin Yun up from his joy and only then did he realize that he was completely naked. Wearing an awkward expression, he asked, “Were you here the entire time?”

“What do you think?” Lil’ Purple smiled.

“Holy shit!” The corner of Lin Yun’s lips twitched and he quickly got himself dressed.
