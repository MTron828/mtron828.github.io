Chapter 2368 - Stage Meant For Geniuses!

“What do you mean?” Xiong Tiannan asked.

Lin Yun looked around and saw multiple beams soaring into the sky. Recollecting his gaze, he said, “The appearance of the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit was abrupt, so it must have been lured over by someone else. It looks like most of the people have run into a Silver-Eyed Demonspirit. Someone must be behind this and sent out Silver-Eyed Demonspirits to stop us.”

Xiong Tiannan finally understood what Lin Yun meant, and Lin Jiangxian said, “That means that we might run into danger if we go any deeper, and we’re not the only ones who are facing a Silver-Eyed Demonspirit.”

“That’s more or less it,” Lin Yun nodded.

Ao Jue’s face changed, before he said, “Xiong Tiannan and I will stop here. There’s something weird about these demonspirits. I have interacted with the Demonspirit Clan before, but the demonic runes are too unusual.”

Lin Yun wasn’t surprised since he had also faced demonspirits before in the Kunlun Realm. They might be hard to kill, but they didn’t have such a terrifying defense. When he faced the Ying River King in the Heavenly Void, the other party was a frightening opponent that nearly forced Lin Yun to use all his trump cards. Even so, it wasn’t as challenging as this Silver-Eyed Demonspirit. He thought that the demonspirits outside the Kunlun Realm were stronger, but he didn’t expect that it was also the case for Ao Jue and Xiong Tiannan.

“There’s something weird about those demonic runes and sacred flames that even sword intent can’t break through.” Xiong Tiannan frowned, and said, “It gave me a feeling that they used the divine blood of the Demonspirit Clan to draw them.”

“Not only that, but the demonic runes have formed into an array with the weakness moving around. It’s practically invincible,” Lin Yun shared his experience with everyone.

“I’ll back out. I can’t stay here any longer,” Ao Jue said decisively. He already discovered that Lin Yun was much stronger than them. If he stayed behind, he would only burden Lin Yun.

“I’ll back out as well,” Xiong Tiannan said. No one persuaded them since even though the Heavenly Barren Banquet’s quotas were necessary, they needed to stay alive to go there.

“Hehe, I’ll wait for you guys on Heavenly Barren Saint Mountain!” Xiong Tiannan smiled. Before they left, they handed over all the spirit cores they had before crushing their medals. An array then appeared beneath them and they disappeared.

Lin Yun and Ji Zixi had to stay behind, and Lin Jiangxian didn’t choose to leave, either. She looked at Lin Yun, and said, “I’ll stay behind to help Zixi. If needed... my sword can also be of help.”

Lin Yun nodded. He believed in Lin Jiangxian’s strength and he needed someone to take care of Ji Zixi while he fought. He asked, “How many spirit cores do we have now?”

“Eighty-three,” Ji Zixi said.

“Not enough. We have to go deeper.” They were far from reaching three hundred, so Lin Yun headed forth. Since Lin Jiangxian was staying around, Lin Yun decided to help her as well.

At the same time, seven swordsmen were fighting a Silver-Eyed Demonspirit deep in the woods. They were all seventh-stage Saint Lords with a high rapport between them.

The Silver-Eyed Demonspirit was strong, not to mention that it was covered in demonic runes. It was hard to inflict heavy injuries on it, even with the Divine light Sword Intent. But with the seven of them forming into an array, the sword intent that they gave off was powerful, and they trapped the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit in the array.

Even if the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit opened its vertical eye, there was nothing it could do to break free from the sword array. Occasionally, when it was about to break free, a sword ray would descend from the sky, suppressing the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit.

Aside from the seven of them, there was also someone in the air who was the core of this array. If someone else was there, they would recognize that it was the Heavenly Sword Pavilion’s Heavenly King Sword Array. As for the person hovering in the air, it was Jiang Ziyao.

“This demonspirit is really tough to deal with, and I can’t find its weakness...” Jiang Ziyao’s eyes flashed. If it was an ordinary Silver-Eyed Demonspirit, it would’ve already been killed by the sword array, so there’s something weird about this demonspirit.

“Since I can’t find the weakness... I will just tear it into pieces, then!” Jiang Ziyao raised his sword and swiped his fingers across the sword with his sword aura rising. Once the Heavenly King Sword Sutra was activated, a white jade palace appeared.

The seven swordsmen underneath Jiang Ziyao also changed their formation and performed the same action as Jiang Ziyao. When the seven light beams flew out, they gathered on Jiang Ziyao and a massive pavilion appeared with an echoing sword vibration.

“Heavenly Divine Sword!” Jiang Ziyao roared, unleashing a sword ray that pierced the chest of the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit and shattered the demonic runes.

“Kill!” Seven swordsmen charged forth and chopped the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit into thousands of pieces.

With a flash, Jiang Ziyao grabbed onto the silver spirit core with a smile.

“Congratulations, Chief!” The seven divine disciples came forth to congratulate their leader.

Jiang Ziyao casually waved his hand, “There’s something weird about this Silver-Eyed Demonspirit, and it’s so tough to deal with that even the Divine Light Sword Intent can’t pierce through it.”

“But it’s still not the chief’s opponent!” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“The chief is invincible!”

“Even if Lin Jiangxian managed to survive by following that Flower Burial, she could only leave, crushing the medal.” The seven divine disciples were flattering, knowing what Jiang Ziyao loved to hear.

Hearing Lin Jiangxian’s name, Jiang Ziyao sneered, “Sword intent has become useless, and even Flower Burial can only become helpless before a Silver-Eyed Demonspirit. It’s a pity... if she’s willing to call me ‘Chief’, I won’t mind protecting her.”

The Divine Shadow Palace’s Heavenly Book was also facing a Silver-Eyed Demonspirit. He was proficient in Great Solar Dao and had grasped the Great Solar Domain. Relying on his Great Solar Dao, he incinerated the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit into ashes. But the demonic runes didn’t disappear but burrowed into the ground.

Seeing this, Heavenly Wood said, “No wonder they’re so tough to deal with. It’s the Demonic Rune Array. Shangguan Jue and Zhao Zhanli stay behind. The rest can leave.”

Under his order, the other disciples of the Shadow Divine Palace left, leaving behind Shangguan Jue and Zhao Zhanli as his aids.

“Senior Brother, do you think Lin Yun can deal with the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit now that sword intent has become useless?” Shangguan Jue asked.

Zhao Zhanli also curiously looked over upon hearing that.

“It’s tough for the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit to kill him, but he can’t deal with the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit either. This stage is his bane,” Heavenly Wood said confidently.

Lin Yun’s talent was unrivalled on Heavenly Barren Saint Mountain, and even Jiang Ziyao was inferior. But he would be in trouble when facing the Silver-Eyed Demonspirits. It would be impossible for Lin Yun to make it through this stage.

“He can already give up on the Heavenly Barren Banquet. The Nether Woods Mountain Range is a hunting ground for geniuses like us!” Heavenly Wood smiled. The Nether Woods Mountain Range was dangerous, but it was also filled with opportunities, and he liked this feeling, especially knowing Lin Yun would be eliminated. But he didn’t know that he was only half right.

The Dao Sect’s Qin Yun, Emerald Jade Manor’s Mu Qianxue, Blood Purgatory Gate’s Can Jue, and Tuoba Hong... all of them shone brightly within the Nether Woods Mountain Range. They were dealing with the Silver-Eyed Demonspirits.

The Nether Woods Mountain Range became a stage for geniuses, while everyone else had left.

At the same time, as more people returned to the Heavenly Barren Saint Mountain, they all felt a lingering fear.

“That was too terrifying. The Silver-Eyed Demonspirits are nearly invincible.”

“This stage is really dangerous.”

“I saw Gongsun Lou, ranked eighty-sixth on the Brandished Dragon Ranking. He was killed before he could crush his medal.”

Everyone’s faces were ugly, but Xiong Tiannan and Ao Jue calmed down after returning. Sensing the surrounding atmosphere, they became worried for Lin Yun.

Everyone began to see who didn’t return from the Nether Woods Mountain Range.

Right then, Profound Sky Venerable flicked his finger, and scenes of the Nether Woods Mountain Range began to appear.

“Heavenly Wood is still in there!”

“So is Tuoba Hong!”

“Jiang Ziyao as well!”

“There’s Qin Yun!” Everyone finally knew what monstrous geniuses meant when they saw the images, and the atmosphere on the stage was no longer that tense.

“It looks like the quota for the Heavenly Barren Banquet will emerge between them, but we’re still lacking...” Everyone sighed.

Ao Jue and Xiong Tiannan were anxious when they couldn’t see Lin Yun anywhere. But there was nothing they could do because they didn’t control the scenes.

Suddenly, a commotion resounded upon seeing a blue-clothed swordsman, Flower Burial Lin Yun.

“Flower Burial is also still there! He defeated a Silver-Eyed Demonspirits as well? This is too unbelievable!”

“If I remember correctly, sword intent doesn’t have much effect on the Silver-Eyed Demonspirits, right?” Everyone on the Heavenly Barren Saint Mountain was shocked. They thought that Lin Yun had returned because that was no longer a stage for him. This was why they were surprised when they saw that he was still there.

In the Nether Woods Mountain Range, Lin Yun frowned upon sensing that someone was spying on him.

“Can he sense it? This is interesting...” Profound Sky Venerable smiled before the scenes disappeared.
