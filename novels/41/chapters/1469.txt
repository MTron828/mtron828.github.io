Chapter 1470 - Not A Bad Idea

All the audience members were left dumbfounded when they saw this scene. They still thought Lin Yun would lose because Jin Xuanyi was simply too strong after he brought out his full strength, shattering all five thousand of Lin Yun’s dragon runes with a punch.

This would’ve ended the myth of Lin Yun’s absolute strength amongst the same generation. But who would’ve thought Lin Yun would respond with a punch, and his punch made Jin Xuanyi kneel on the spot? With the battle coming to this point, anyone could tell who was the stronger one.

Both sides didn’t draw their sword, nor did they summon their constellations, and Jin Xuanyi had failed to suppress Lin Yun. This made Ji Shuxuan turn back and look at this scene with shock. He couldn’t believe Lin Yun used a punch to heavily injure Jin Xuanyi. This toppled his common sense.

Before he could come to his senses, Lin Yun dashed towards the ninth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flower after making Jin Xuanyi fly away with a punch. His pupils were blazing with flames because the ninth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flower alone was enough for him to give it his all, even without the reward of the Dragon-Blooded Crystal.

“Faster! Faster!” Lin Yun rushed himself. Although Jin Xuanyi was heavily injured, this didn’t mean that he no longer had the strength to fight. So Lin Yun wanted to grab the ninth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flower before Jin Xuanyi recovered.

“Don’t even think about it!” Ji Shuxuan unleashed his sword aura upon seeing through Lin Yun’s objective. As flames blazed in his pupils, he quickened his pace in breaking through the sword aura around the Azure Lotus Sword Flower.

The ninth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flower was shrouded in countless golden threads, and it was dangerous to try and get in. This was the defense mechanism of the Azure Lotus Sword Flower. If one didn’t have enough strength, they would be torn to pieces when they tried to break in.

The threads' range had spread to roughly a thousand meters, but this distance was nothing for Lin Yun and Ji Shuxuan. But because of the threads, Lin Yun and Ji Shuxuan had to be cautious.

“I won’t be able to catch up.” Lin Yun paused and looked at Ji Shuxuan, who made it though eight hundred meters of golden threads. Ji Shuxuan had brought out the Scarlet Firmament Sword Sutra, and Lin Yun could tell that his saint sword was exceptionally sharp.

So if Lin Yun couldn’t think of a way, there was no way he could catch up. He was more than seven hundred meters away from the Azure Lotus Sword Flower, while Ji Shuxuan was only left with over a hundred meters. The difference between them was too significant.

Lin Yun recollected all his sword intent and pushed his cultivation to the limit before he threw a punch out, but the threads didn’t budge and tensed up, making the threads even tougher. Lin Yun tried to use his vitality and nether energy, but none of them had any effects.

While testing the threads, Ji Shuxuan was less than ten meters away from the ninth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flower. When Ji Shuxuan turned around and saw the distance between Lin Yun and him, he was briefly stunned before a smile appeared on his face.

Not too far away, Jin Xuanyi’s complexion improved after he threw out a few mouthfuls of blood. He breathed a sigh of relief when he raised his head and saw that Ji Shuxuan was about to retrieve the ninth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flower.

He wasn’t afraid that Ji Shuxuan would take it for himself; he believed in Ji Shuxuan’s character. He believed that Ji Shuxuan would wait for him to recover before holding a fair battle between them to determine the ownership of it.

“He doesn’t have a chance.” Mu Qingqing whispered on the Celestial Observing Stage.

“Let’s wait a little longer.” Mu Xueqin said. Lin Yun gave her too many surprises, and she didn’t think that he would disappoint her. Not to mention that Lin Yun stopped on purpose, and he should be getting a result soon in whatever he was doing.

After Ji Shuxuan glanced at Lin Yun, he turned back and continued to hack the golden threads. The golden threads were entangled together like silk, but fortunately, only a few meters were left.

But when he turned around, he saw that Lin Yun had instantly figured it all out. The threads could only be cut by sword intent, and no other energy could sever them. Lin Yun didn’t hesitate to summon the Flower Burial Sword from the sword box he carried before drawing it out from the sheath.

When he waved his hand, all the threads ahead of him were easily sliced into two. Without the golden threads stopping him, Lin Yun wouldn’t even need the time to blink to cross this distance.

When Ji Shuxuan turned his head around, Lin Yun was a few hundred meters away. But when he turned his head back to the ninth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flower, a figure had already grabbed it while breathing a sigh of relief.

This made Ji Shuxuan’s smile stiffen as he muttered, “What the hell is going on?”

He quickly turned around and could only see an afterimage of Lin Yun that was eight hundred meters away, making him furrow his brows. When he turned back, that figure was already gone, leaving him even more confused. As he turned his head back again, Lin Yun reappeared where he left his afterimage. But it was different this time because Lin Yun was holding onto the ninth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flower.

This instantly made Ji Shuxuan’s mind go blank as he wondered if he was hallucinating. He couldn’t comprehend what was happening, but all the audience members had clearly seen it. All the threads before Lin Yun snapped after he drew his sword, which meant that Ji Shuxuan instantly lost his advantage as Lin Yun retrieved the Azure Lotus Sword Flower before retreating.

Everyone in the Celestial Observing Lake fell into a brief silence before breaking into an uproar. Lin Yun made Jin Xuanyi kneel before retrieving the ninth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flower ahead of Ji Shuxuan. Why do they feel that the Twin Stars of the Earth Ranking were nothing in front of Lin Yun?

This was too unbelievable and this drew exclamations from everyone in the surroundings. Ji Shuxuan’s face became ashen as he returned with his gaze fixed on Lin Yun. A golden light streaked past. Jin Xuanyi then appeared, but his facial expression was ugly.

As Jin Xuanyi took a deep breath, he looked at Lin Yun. “Hand it over. We can compensate you with an eighth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flower. You have no chance at facing us both.”

His tone had softened this time and was no longer as aloof as before because he offered to give Lin Yun compensation. Evidently, he knew why young people were arrogant from that punch earlier, and he no longer dared to look down on him.

“You don’t have any ghost spirit martial techniques, and you’ll be at a disadvantage when facing us both. This is also why Brother Jin didn’t draw his sword against you. This is because we don’t want to take too much of an advantage of you.” Ji Shuxuan maintained his composure as he tried to reason with Lin Yun.

“Did I draw my sword earlier? Why do you make it sound like I’ve drawn my sword?” Lin Yun responded with a smile.

His words put Ji Shuxuan and Jin Xuanyi at a loss for words because Lin Yun didn’t draw his sword in his fight with Jin Xuanyi, and he was clearly stronger in the last confrontation.

“You two don’t have to go easy on me. I didn’t practice a ghost spirit sword technique because it was my master’s instructions. But that doesn’t mean my sword technique can’t confront ghost spirit sword techniques. If you guys want the ninth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flower, prove to me that you two are worthy with your swords, then.” Lin Yun said.

Jin Xuanyi and Ji Shuxuan were shocked by Lin Yun’s words because that was the same as challenging them simultaneously.

“I, alone, am enough to deal with you!” Jin Xuanyi said as he drew his sword from his sword box. When he unsheathed his sword, he appeared before Lin Yun with a painting unfolding behind him. This painting was a golden person wearing a crown, a portrait of an ancient king. But it didn’t stop there, that person walked out of the painting and was three hundred meters in height, unleashing the aura of a monarch.

This time, Jin Xuanyi didn’t hold back, bringing out his full power, including his constellation and sword technique. He had laid all of his pride down, hoping to cleanse his humiliation from his previous fight with Lin Yun.

Ji Shuxuan briefly hesitated and ultimately chose not to interfere.

Facing Jin Xuanyi, Lin Yun calmly summoned his constellation and three paintings flew out from him. They were the Flying Serpent, Qiongqi, and Aurora Dragon. When the three paintings appeared, they immediately negated the aura from Jin Xuanyi’s constellation, and the aura from those three paintings was even stronger.

Holding onto the Azure Lotus Sword Flower with his right and his sheathed sword in his left, Lin Yun swayed his body to dodge Jin Xuanyi’s attacks. He would occasionally raise his left hand to block Jin Xuanyi’s attacks with the sheath.

“You’re looking down on me?” Jin Xuanyi’s eyes blazed with raging flames when he saw Lin Yun still having no intentions of drawing his sword. With a flick of his wrist, he unleashed countless sword rays.

As he unleashed his dual sword souls from the center of his brows, Lin Yun waved the sheath in his left hand as he retreated. The cauldron in his violet palace had also come out of the astral energy ocean, and his body was filled with explosive astral energy. After circulating both his sword sutras, his attacks weren’t any weaker than Jin Xuanyi. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

He might seem like he was just casually waving his left hand, but he would repeatedly point out the flaws in Jin Xuanyi’s attacks. Just like that, a bizarre scene occurred where Lin Yun easily resolved all of Jin Xuanyi’s attacks, no matter how ferocious the latter’s attacks were.

Right then, Jin Xuanyi suddenly changed his move and pulled his sword before stabbing it forth. This time, his sword wasn’t aimed at Lin Yun’s vital points but his right wrist, the hand Lin Yun used to hold the Azure Lotus Sword Flower. So this meant that Lin Yun couldn’t draw his sword.

This made Lin Yun interested as his eyes flashed. With a smile, Lin Yun tossed the Azure Lotus Sword Flower into the air and grabbed onto the Flower Burial Sword, drawing it out. As a dazzling sword ray bloomed, Lin Yun easily knocked Jin Xuanyi’s sword away.

As he gently tapped his foot on the lake, Lin Yun circled around the lake with his sword aura accumulating. When he returned to the front, the tip of his sheath struck Jin Xuanyi’s chest.

This made Jin Xuanyi let out a groan before he was sent flying away and landed beside Ji Shuxuan. When Jin Xuanyi raised his head, he saw the ninth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flower landing on the tip of Lin Yun’s scabbard.

“Not a bad idea. But unfortunately, I’m faster than you.” Lin Yun smiled.

But Ji Shuxuan and Jin Xuanyi couldn’t smile because Lin Yun’s smile made them feel a chill down their spines with their backs covered in a cold sweat.
