Chapter 1062 - Two Birds With One Stone

With a piece of white cloth covering his eyes, Lin Yun walked to the edge of the cliff. Under the light from the Time-Turning Mirror, the Divine Blood Fruit glistened with dew.

Lin Yun couldn’t see it right now, but he could sense the existence of the Divine Blood Fruit. It was an extremely rare Divine Blood Fruit that far exceeded the value of the other three. It made sense that the temptation for this Divine Blood Fruit was a lot stronger than normal. After all, Lin Yun was tempted to eat it. Even Yue Weiwei, who had a Divine Blood Fruit, nearly fell for its temptation.

“Big Brother Yun, why don’t we wait? Your eyes are still bleeding.” Yue Weiwei didn’t dare to look at the abyss because of her fear of the Divine Blood Fruit.

“No need. If I refine the sword ray right now, I won’t be able to retrieve the Divine Blood Fruit after my eyes recover,” analyzed Lin Yun calmly.

Lin Yun might not be able to refine the leaves and fruit right now, but he might be able to refine the dew on the leaves. If he could do it, then it would be a huge asset for him. As for the actual fruit, he would have to wait.

The Divine Blood Fruit was a fortune for powerhouses, so there was no way someone in the Heavenly Soul Realm could refine it. Even Lin Yun couldn’t ensure that he could maintain his clarity if got too close to it. But now that he had temporarily lost his eyesight, he had a good chance before him.

“Big Brother Yun, you have to be careful. You have to put it in this bottle immediately after taking it. No ordinary item can contain the Divine Blood Fruit except for this bottle. There’s pure water inside that can contain the Divine Blood Fruit.” Yue Weiwei clearly had preparations as she had a container for the fruit.

After understanding how to use the bottle, Lin Yun put it away and took a deep breath. Then, he jumped off the cliff. He couldn’t see anything, but he could sense the Divine Blood Fruit clearly with his origin energy.

When Lin Yun was 1,000 meters away from the Divine Blood Fruit, various phenomena began to appear. Halos full of immense power formed around the Divine Blood Fruit.

In the blink of an eye, the lights formed a figure. The Divine Blood Fruit had sensed danger and was defending itself. Clearly, the fruit had some kind of intelligence. After all, even ordinary herbs had the intelligence of a kid after 10,000 years. However, the Divine Blood Fruit’s intelligence couldn’t be compared to a kid as it had a pretty evolved intelligence.

The figure threw a punch at Lin Yun full sword profundities. Countering this, light emitted from the surface of Lin Yun’s body as he faced the attack with his own sword intent.

“Comet Moon!” Lin Yun clenched his fist and threw an attack towards the figure. The figure was blown away, allowing Lin Yun to get 200 meters closer to the Divine Blood Fruit.

As its phenomena were destroyed, the Divine Blood Fruit emitted a dark blood light. Then, all seven of its petals moved, unleashing elemental martial intents such as wind, flame, lightning, and ice. Each elemental martial intent formed a fatal attack that caught Lin Yun by surprise.

Each one of the attacks was a holy spirit martial technique. It was only natural that Lin Yun was surprised. It seemed like each leaf contained martial intent and dao rhyme of the god.

Lin Yun began to theorize that the attacks would transcend holy spirit martial techniques after the Divine Blood Fruit grew to a certain extent. But before he could think more about it, seven different holy spirit martial techniques flew towards him. Lin Yun didn’t dare to face the attacks head-on, so he condensed a pair of golden crow wings behind him.

“Flower Burial Sword!” Lin Yun waved his hand and summoned the Flower Burial Sword along with the two holy spirits from within his body. With the Golden Crow on his left and the Silver Phoenix on his right, all darkness in the abyss was dispelled.

“Solaris Lunar!” Lin Yun roared as the spirits manifested a sun and moon. Then, he executed the third form of the Three Heavenly Divides. When the boundless sword ray shot out, it tore out a hole through the incoming attacks. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

However, the attacks continued to make their way over. In the next second, the dragon images around Lin Yun shattered as he flew in the sky.

The combination of the seven holy spirit martial techniques was too strong. After all, the Azure Dragon Saint Armor was able to resist the strongest attacks of two Realm Sons. Since his armor shattered, he decided to fly back to the cliff.

At this moment, light was shining on the surface of Yue Weiwei’s body. She seemed to be circulating her cultivation technique as her hair fluttered wildly and revealed a crimson mark on her forehead. Her face was also pale as she was still recovering her strength.

What kind of cultivation technique is that? Lin Yun couldn’t see, but he could sense the demonic aura coming from Yue Weiwei. However, the demonic aura was extremely pure and not violent like what he had sensed in the past. Although he had a feeling that Yue Weiwei was from the Demon Clan, her origin seemed to be a lot more terrifying than he had imagined.

“Big Brother Lin, you’re up.” Yue Weiwei opened her eyes and the crimson mark on her forehead disappeared. Her gaze was a lot gentler now as she didn’t bother to hide her expressions.

Lin Yun nodded his head and explained what he experienced. When Yue Weiwei heard his words, she locked her brows together and bit her lips, “Seven martial intents and seven holy spirit martial techniques overlapping together… even an ordinary empyrean might not be able to face that head-on. It looks like it won’t be easy to obtain the Divine Blood Fruit.”

Lin Yun didn’t say anything because he avoided most of the attack. Since the Azure Dragon Saint Armor shattered, he knew that he could easily die if he wasn’t careful. Without reaching the Empyrean Realm, Lin Yun didn’t have much hope in obtaining the Divine Blood Fruit.

“Perhaps I can do this…” Lin Yun said after a brief moment of hesitation. If he actually refined the sword ray in his eyes, he could face the seven holy spirit martial techniques. He didn’t need to destroy them, but he needed just enough more help to get the fruit into the bottle.

With the power of that sword ray, it might be possible. Then again, it was also a dangerous method.

“Haha. Big Brother Yun, that method might actually work.” Yue Weiwei looked around before she held her chin, “Normally speaking, it’s hard to refine that wisp of sword ray, but you might have a high chance if you use that Divine Blood Fruit.”

Yue Weiwei was smart, so she thought about many things that Lin Yun overlooked.

“I thought you would stop me,” smiled Lin Yun.

“Hmph, I won’t stop you from doing what you want to do. But if you end up dying down there, I’ll die alongside you because you’re my Big Brother Yun.” Yue Weiwei smiled. She knew that Lin Yun couldn’t see her right now, so she didn’t feel shy when she looked at him.

But even though Lin Yun couldn’t see with his eyes, he could still sense how bewitching Yue Weiwei was. Fortunately for him, he couldn’t see her smile.

A fragrant breeze blew past Lin Yun as Yue Weiwei shoved a pellet into Lin Yun’s mouth. When she saw that Lin Yun was caught by surprise, she smiled, “Big Brother Yun, just hold that saint pellet in your mouth to replenish your vitality.”

Lin Yun knew that this saint pellet was precious, so he simply nodded and jumped off the cliff. He wanted to refine the sword ray in the abyss to grab the Divine Blood Fruit.

The speed of Lin Yun's descent slowed down when he recalled the wisp of sword ray in his eyes. Light was shining through the cloth covering his eyes, which meant that his injuries were getting worse, “How troublesome.”

He knew that he didn’t have much time left. If he couldn’t refine the sword ray in the short amount of time that he had, he might lose his sight forever. He might even get buried in the abyss. However, Lin Yun had no intention of admitting defeat. Plus, he didn’t want Yue Weiwei to die here with him.

So what if it was a god? As long as Lin Yun had his sword, he could face anything in his way! In the next second, he wielded the Flower Burial Sword and charged towards the Divine Blood Fruit.
