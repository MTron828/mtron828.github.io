Chapter 1386 - It Has Been Ten Moves (1)

Lin Yun merely glanced at Jiang Tao before he shifted his gaze to everyone else, using his sword intent to sweep through the entire inn. The Sword Sect used this inn to house their subsidiary forces, but many people entered this inn because of how filled the city was.

The inn was heavily guarded, and Lin Yun’s sword intent could sense many Dragon Pulse Realm experts and a Samsara Edict Realm expert. But seeing that they didn’t react, did this mean that they wouldn’t interfere in the affairs between juniors?

Swiftly recollecting his thoughts, Lin Yun said, “You guys are all here for the test, and it’s only right for us to get acquainted, especially since we’ve just arrived. But it’s late tonight, so we’ll pay everyone a visit at a later date. So, please leave.” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Lin Yun was already polite, hinting his refusal and the test's importance. But Jiang Tao’s face sank because he felt he was being disregarded. Earlier, he seemed confident that Ye Ziling opened her door for him, but Lin Yun quickly disregarded him. How could he accept that? Most importantly, Ye Ziling didn’t deny that, and she didn’t spare a glance at him.

“Looks like the door wasn’t opened for Jiang Tao…”

“Haha, this is interesting. Jiang Tao is being disregarded.” Those from the other forces were briefly stunned before they instantly figured out what Lin Yun was trying to say. But their expressions became playful because a small sect from the Profound Azure Prefecture actually dared to disregard Jiang Tao.

It was just as they had expected, since the other disciples from the Flowing Cloud Sect became unhappy when they saw Jiang Tao’s face sink.

“Who the hell do you think you are? Our senior brother is here to pay Lady Ye a visit.”

“Who the hell do you think you are? Didn’t you see that the door has opened for our senior brother?”

“Get lost while you still can!” The Flowing Cloud Sect’s disciples all looked at Lin Yun unhappily.

Their words nearly made Ye Ziling flare up. But just when she was about to make a move, Lin Yun stopped her with a smile, “I have a good temper. So let me handle this matter first.”

When Lin Yun claimed that he had a good temper, the lips of Feng Zhang and Liu Qingyan twitched as they sent a weird look at Lin Yun. This was because they knew how ‘good’ Lin Yun’s temper was.

“I really have a good temper…” Lin Yun looked at Feng Zhang and Liu Qingyan, who had helpless smiles on their faces.

“So, you’re saying I don’t have a good temper?” Ye Ziling unhappily glared at Lin Yun.

Lin Yun didn’t dare to reply, but he knew that Ye Ziling had no tolerance for someone like Jiang Tao. If she made a move, then no one here would be able to escape. At the very least, they would all end up heavily crippled.

At that time, let’s not mention if they could still partake in the test, it would be a problem if they could get down from their bedward in half a year. Since this inn belonged to the Sword Sect, Lin Yun felt he had to give the Sword Sect some face. After all, there was a Samsara Edict Realm stationed in this inn.

When Jiang Tao saw Lin Yun and Ye Ziling happily chatting amongst themselves and disregarding him, his rage finally reached the limit.How could he suck this up? Who was he? He was a descendant of a Saint Clan! But mere barbarians have the guts to disregard him?

But what made him even more furious was how close Ye Ziling and Lin Yun looked when they were chatting, which sparked his jealousy. Initially, he only treated Ye Ziling as a gem from the countryside, but he didn’t expect her to be so aloof. So how could he possibly bear it?

As rage blazed in Jiang Tao’s eyes, he suppressed his anger. Since they wanted to play with him, he would play with them. He smiled, “You look decent. How do I address you?”

When Lin Yun looked at Jiang Tao, he instantly knew what the latter was planning and replied with a smile, “Lin Yun. Flower Burial Lin Yun.”

“Lin Yun? Have you heard of him before?”

“Do you guys know who he is?”

“Haha, what are you talking about? How can someone from the countryside possibly be heard by me? They have to be at least in the top three thousandths on the Empyrean Ranking, but do you think that’s possible?”

“That makes sense.” Everyone mocked when they heard Lin Yun’s introduction.

It had only been two months since the events on the Profound Wither Island, so Lin Yun’s acts of starting a massacre and suppressing Qin Cang still hadn’t spread out in the Ancient Barren Domain. Not to mention that Lin Yun had just reached the Elysium Core Realm, so he didn’t leave his name behind on the Empyrean Ranking, nor did he have his name on the Elysium Core Ranking for now.

But Lin Yun’s name had long spread throughout the saint clans and powerful sects. So Lin Yun’s name was only heard by those at the top of the pyramid in the Ancient Barren Domain for now. These people who were ridiculing him had no idea that they were the frogs in the well.

Jiang Tao had stayed in the Flowing Cloud Sect for a long time, so he naturally never heard of Lin Yun’s name. He smiled, “Since you dare to give yourself a title, I believe that Brother Lin is proficient in the sword, right?”

He planned to praise Lin Yun to cloud nine before slapping his face. Jiang Tao had often used this tactic and planned to use it on Lin Yun again.

“Not bad, I guess?” Lin Yun replied.

Jiang Tao squinted his eyes and said with a friendly smile, “So, do you have any interest in exchanging some moves? You said it wasn’t appropriate for a visit since it has gotten dark, so it should be fine to forge a friendship with swords, right?”

“I don’t think that’s a good idea.” Lin Yun disagreed because he had no interest in bullying Jiang Tao.

“Haha. Brother Lin, you don’t have to worry that I’ll take advantage of you. Let’s not use our cultivation at all, and we’ll simply exchange some moves with our sword techniques.” Jiang Tao wore an even more friendly smile.

“I don’t think there’s a need for that,” replied Lin Yun.

If they used their cultivation, Jiang Tao might be able to last for a more extended period of time since he had a cultivation at the Greater Elysium Core Realm. But if they weren’t going to use their cultivation at all, then Jiang Tao was no different from courting death. This was why Lin Yun didn’t think there was a need for that.

“It’s just a small game. To start, I’ll place something to bet on myself,” said Jiang Tao as he retrieved a box from his interspatial pouch. When he opened the box, an elixir shrouded in nine strands of sacred light was revealed.

Each strand of light was brilliant and looked alive. Aside from that, the pellet's surface was engraved with runes that prevented the spiritual energy in the pellet from escaping.

The pellet's surface was enveloped in a faint light that made the entire pellet look like a crystal. A fragrance was also emitted from the pellet that formed into a faint rainbow ripple in the air, so the entire pellet was shining brightly.

“Nine Profound Pellet!”

“Holy shit. The Flowing Cloud Sect prepared a saint pellet for Jiang Tao?”

“Looks like the Flowing Cloud Sect treated him well because of his origin from a saint clan. This is really generous of them…”

“He’s probably here to become a disciple of a saint. I heard that the saints of the Sword Sect would be showing up this time to take in disciples. If he manages to become a saint’s disciple, everything will be worth it!”

When everyone saw the Nine Profound Pellet in Jiang Tao’s hand, they were first shocked before their pupils were filled with envy. Meanwhile, everyone from the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect was looking at Lin Yun with weird gazes.

“I don’t need you to defeat me. This Nine Profound Pellet is yours as long as you can last ten moves under my hands. I, Jiang Tao, am a man of my word!” Jiang Tao smiled. He wasn’t afraid Lin Yun wouldn’t be attracted because he was confident that anyone would fall for his trick if they heard his offer.

When he was done, even the people in the surroundings were tempted by Jiang Tao’s offer and turned to look at Jiang Tao enviously.

“There’s no need for that.” Lin Yun still didn’t agree to it. That saint pellet was extraordinary, and he would be lying to say that he wasn’t tempted. But he would be bullying Jiang Tao if he agreed to it. If Jiang Tao didn’t take out the saint pellet for the bet, Lin Yun might have had a slight interest in playing with him.

“What’s wrong? Flower Burial doesn’t have the guts to take on my challenge? You don’t even dare to take ten moves from our senior brother, and you have the face to give yourself a title?” A disciple of the Flowing Cloud Sect mocked with everyone echoing after her.

None of them was a pushover, and they instantly figured out that Jiang Tao was trying to mess with this barbarian from the Profound Azure Prefecture.

Lin Yun briefly pondered and replied, “Let’s exchange a few moves, then. It’s a friendly spar, so let’s not take it too far. After all, I have a good temper.”
