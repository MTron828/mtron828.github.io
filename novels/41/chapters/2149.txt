Chapter 2150 - Eastern Desolation’s Glory

“Senior Brother has made a move!” While Lin Yun was treating Ji Zixi’s injuries with his blue dragon aura, he watched as the Dao Yang Holy Son clashed with He Xuanjing.

The Dao Yang Holy Son was strong because he also practiced a bizarre cultivation technique, the Heavenly Devour Sacred Canon, aside from possessing the Great Sun Saint Physique. He had devoured ten-odd Glory Saint Artifacts before reaching the Quasi-Saint Realm.

Before Lin Yun had grasped the Azure Dragon Divine Physique, even his physique couldn’t be compared to the Dao Yang Holy Son. Then again, the Dao Yang Holy Son must’ve gotten stronger now after reaching the Indigo Origin Phase of the Quasi-Saint Realm.

Lin Yun wanted to see if the Dao Yang Holy Son’s Great Sun Saint Physique and Heavenly Devour Sacred Canon could compete with his Azure Dragon Divine Physique.

“Don’t be distracted,” Bai Shuying said.

Lin Yun smiled, “It’s fine. I have already resolved the blade intent within her body.”

“What?!” Bai Shuying and Xin Yan were surprised. They knew how powerful He Xuanjing’s blade intent was, not to mention that it was further empowered with saint dao. The blade intent left in Ji Zixi’s body was equivalent to a bottomless abyss, and they couldn’t get rid of it no matter how much saint aura they transmitted into Ji Zixi.

“How did you manage to do it?” Bai Shuying asked.

“That’s a secret.” Lin Yun didn’t talk much because he didn’t want them to worry. Blade intent that reached the sixth grade was troublesome to deal with, just like sword intent. If one wanted to get rid of it, it would be best for a Saint to personally make a move since even a Quasi-Saint at the Heavenly Origin Phase wouldn’t have a better solution for it.

That was the same for Lin Yun, but he had another method, which was to absorb the blade intent into his body before fusing it with his Astral Sword Intent. The process was dangerous, but Lin Yun could withstand it with his Azure Dragon Divine Physique.

“Her complexion has become much better,” Xin Yan said, looking at Ji Zixi’s face. Ji Zixi’s face had become rosy, and the wound on her chest was slowly healing up.

Ji Zixi suddenly coughed as she struggled to open her eyes.

“You’re awake?” Lin Yun smiled.

But when Ji Zixi saw Lin Yun’s face, she became unhappy and gave Lin Yun a punch. Lin Yun was still transmitting his blue dragon aura into her body, so he couldn’t avoid this punch. The punch was painful, making Lin Yun take a cold breath.

Bai Shuying and Xin Yan quickly helped explain Lin Yun’s actions. Realising that she made a mistake, Ji Zixi embarrassedly said, “I’m sorry. I thought…”

“You thought that I’m a Holy Maiden Killer, and was trying to take advantage of you? It’s fine. It looks like the little princess already knows how to protect herself at a young age,” Lin Yun smiled.

Ji Zixi frowned because she didn’t like someone calling her a little princess.

Lin Yun ignored her and took a deep breath before he stopped treating her injuries. He said, “All done now. There won’t be any hidden injuries left behind.”

“What about the injuries on her back?” Bai Shuying asked.

There were two terrifying wounds on Ji Zixi’s back, left behind when He Xuanjing ripped the wings off of her.

“There’s nothing I can do to help. There’s a powerful saint seal there, and my blue… my saint aura can’t get close,” Lin Yun said. He nearly had a slip of his tongue, but it was lucky that he responded in time.

“He’s right. Big Sister Shuying, I’ll be fine after a short rest,” Ji Zixi said. Now that her injuries settled down, everyone’s gazes fell on He Xuanjing and the Dao Yang Holy Son. The fight was intense, and the two were evenly matched. The two had already summoned their constellations without any reservations in the fight.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

The sky was covered with an indigo saint aura with various phenomena clashing together. The Dao Yang Holy Son was like a bright sun, enveloping the Dragon’s Head in a high temperature that required saint aura to withstand.

Everyone outside the dragon mountains came to their senses and realized that the Dao Yang Holy Son wasn’t any weaker than the champion of a Heavenly Path. They were greatly surprised by this tattered-looking youth.

He Xuanjing also felt great pressure coming from the Dao Yang Holy Son, and he wasn’t acting this time. His blade intent was practically invincible after being empowered with saint dao. He could even shatter saint artifacts with his attacks, but his attacks didn’t leave any marks on the Dao Yang Holy Son’s body, whose physique was tougher than a Glory Saint Artifact.

This made him feel uncomfortable because he couldn’t inflict any injuries on the Dao Yang Holy Son, no matter how strong his attacks were. Even if he used his secret techniques, they were easily resolved by the radiance given off by the sun. On the contrary, the Dao Yang Holy Son’s attacks covered him in blood.

“His great sun aura has gotten stronger.” Lin Yun fought with the Dao Yang Holy Son before, and he knew about the latter’s strength. The latter might seem to possess an invincible physique, but that was because of the great sun aura within his body.

The aura possessed a powerful yang energy that was so domineering that it could reflect many attacks. But Lin Yun didn’t understand much about it and only felt that it was filled with mystery. The Dao Yang Holy Son didn’t require any weapons to fight against He Xuanjing because his body was the strongest saint artifact!

“I guess it’s my turn now?” After the Dao Yang Holy Son sent He Xuanjing flying away, he raised his brow and dashed forth.

The stalemate was immediately shattered. The Dao Yang Holy Son would leave a hole in mid-air whenever he threw his punch. Each punch was enveloped in blazing flames that were like a dazzling sun. The Dao Yang Holy Son held the advantage in the battle while He Xuanjing was forced to retreat.

But this scene made everyone from the Heavenly Dao Sect nervous because He Xuanjing was too cunning, and it was hard for them to differentiate if this was real or an act. So they couldn’t tell if the Dao Yang Holy Son really held the advantage in the fight.

“That fellow is doing it again!” Ji Zixi said furiously. She fell for it before and was under the impression that He Xuanjing was fighting with his best. As a result, she didn’t resort to her trump cards, allowing He Xuanjing to inflict heavy injuries on her with one strike.

“Don’t worry about it. He’s really in trouble this time,” Lin Yun said.

Ji Zixi looked at Lin Yun with surprise because he sounded a little too confident, which seemed arrogant.

“The champions of the Heavenly Paths are really strong. Even if you’ve defeated Mu Qianjue, you can’t underestimate the other champions,” Ji Zixi said. Considering that Lin Yun saved her earlier, she didn’t directly rebuke his words.

Lin Yun smiled because he was the Champion of the Ninth Heavenly Path, so he understood better than anyone else how powerful the other champions were. He smiled, “Carry on watching.”

Right then, something unexpected occurred. A terrifying aura swept out from He Xuanjing. This caught the Dao Yang Holy Son by surprise and was sent flying away by He Xuanjing’s blade aura. An unprecedented blade aura formed into a bizarre flower behind He Xuanjing. This flower had nine petals, enveloped in countless saint daos with a crimson radiance shining from the flower bud.

“Sovereign Dao!” Everyone outside the dragon mountains was shocked with disbelief. Many people were wondering if anyone would grasp the Sovereign Dao, but most people didn’t believe it since it was too shocking. There weren’t many who could grasp the Sovereign Dao in the past three thousand years.

Each of them was a peerless expert, and they were only second to the Nine Emperors. As for those who grasped it at the Quasi-Saint Realm, there were simply none. But one had appeared before their eyes, and this left everyone shocked. Those from the Heavenly Dao Sect even felt despair when they saw this scene.

Would what happened to Ji Zixi be repeated with the Dao Yang Holy Son? Everyone trembled when they recalled Ji Zixi’s encounter. Blade intent was the same as sword intent, and it was also one of the thirty-six Sovereign Daos, so many saints couldn’t grasp it in their lifetime. But He Xuanjing had grasped a Sovereign Dao while being at the Quasi-Saint Realm!

He Xuanjing was a decisive person and his blade fell onto the Dao Yang Holy Son. This time, cracks appeared on the Dao Yang Holy Son’s body, and the golden radiance coming from his physique became dim. The high temperature on the Dragon’s Head weakened, and the aura released by the Dao Yang Holy Son crumbled with one blade.

But He Xuanjing’s blade was soon stuck on Dao Yang Holy Son’s shoulder bone, and he couldn’t pull his blade out when he tried. He praised, “It’s impossible for you to withstand my blade with the Great Sun Saint Physique alone. You must have had other encounters. But it doesn’t matter before absolute strength.”

He Xuanjing was exhausted and didn’t want to waste any words with the Dao Yang Holy Son. He only wanted to end this battle quickly so that he could rest. This battle was too exhausting for him, and his face suddenly changed when he was shocked to discover that he couldn’t draw the blade no matter how he tried.

He squinted and was so shocked that he couldn’t say a word. His blade wasn’t stuck on the bones but there was a powerful force coming from the Dao Yang Holy Son that stuck onto the blade. Not only the blade but the saint aura in the blade, as well as the saint dao being devoured at a swift speed.

This shocked He Xuanjing, and he quickly loosened his grip. He wanted to let go of the blade and flee, but it was already too late.

“You’re too late,” The Dao Yang Holy Son smiled. He finally managed to trick He Xuanjing into revealing his trump card, so why would he let the latter go so easily?

“Heavenly Devour Sacred Canon!” Dao Yang Holy Son formed a seal with a powerful devouring force coming from within his body, and a powerful aura exploded. This time, the aura he gave off belonged to Devour Dao, one of the thirty-six Sovereign Daos, and the flower behind He Xuanjing began to wither.

When the Dao Yang Holy Son threw a punch, he poured his devouring energy into this punch, smashing apart half of He Xuanjing’s body and sending him flying away.

The Dao Yang Holy Son removed the crimson blade. This Glory Saint Artifact had already lost its luster, so he easily snapped the blade apart by slightly exerting some force.

“My blade!” He Xuanjing screamed when he saw this scene. To a bladesman, there was nothing more humiliating and painful than to have his blade snapped in public.

The Dao Yang Holy Son said, “You can jump down yourself. After injuring so many people of my Eastern Desolation, don’t even think about leaving your name on the Blue Dragon Record.”
