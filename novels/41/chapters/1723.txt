Chapter 1724 – Submit

Seven days later, a dragon’s roar and phoenix’s cry echoed from Lin Yun’s body as he sat on the Nine Saint Diagram. As waves of powerful sword aura swept out from Lin Yun, he emitted an unprecedented golden brilliance like a sword that had undergone the temperament of flames for a thousand years.

At this moment, Lin Yun’s Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon finally reached the sixth stage. Along with a breakthrough in the sword sutra, the scriptures engraved on the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron increased and grew from a thousand to two thousand words.

The two thousand ancient words were emitting a faint radiance, and a destructive and bloodlusty aura. When the cauldron trembled, a sword vibration echoed. The cauldron became much heavier, and the Netherflower, initially suppressing the cauldron, was knocked away.

When the dragon origin ocean broke apart, the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron restored its demonic trait with a destructive and bloodlusty aura being emitted, trying to possess him.

“This fellow is really a double-edged sword.” Lin Yun predicted this, and knew that the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra at the seventh stage would have great difficulty suppressing the cauldron. But he didn’t panic. The golden human in his sword ocean formed a seal, and the golden dragon coursed through his body.

When the Azure Dragon’s sword soul was released, Lin Yun was enveloped in a sword ray with every part of his body covered in torrential killing intent. He was no longer the same person he was when he joined the Sword Sect. If the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron wanted to cause him trouble, he would just teach it a lesson, then.

As shattering noises echoed from within his body, the crimson demonic radiance emitted from the cauldron began to crumble. Within his sword ocean, the golden human was controlling the Azure Dragon’s sword soul to teach it a lesson.

If the crimson demonic radiance was spreading through his blood, he would just have to deal with it from the root. If the crimson demonic radiance took root in his internal organs, he would just have to force it out. If the crimson demonic radiance wanted to hide within his dragon pulses, he would just have to destroy it within his dragon pulses. He didn’t go easy and efficiently suppressed the crimson demonic radiance.

“Go back!” Lin Yun roared, forcing the crimson demonic radiance from the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron back. A contending sensation spread throughout his body when the crimson demonic radiance was pushed back.

But even if the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron had calmed down, Lin Yun had no intentions of letting it off. His Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon had just reached the sixth stage, and he needed to make the cauldron spit something out.

Under the control of the golden human within his sword soul, the Azure Dragon’s sword soul entered the Netherflower. As sixty-four petals opened simultaneously, a five-foot sword rose from the stamen. In the next second, the Netherflower began to rotate with a boundless sword aura crashing down on the cauldron.

When the cauldron was slowly dragged out from the dragon origin ocean, he could sense that the cauldron was trying to struggle free. But Lin Yun ignored its struggles since he was determined to teach it a lesson today.

The Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron was a behemoth, devouring a lot of Lin Yun’s resources. So who knew how much it devoured from the Nine Lotus Diagram, but he was sure that the cauldron devoured at least nine-tenths.

Not only was it a behemoth and devoured most of his resources, it even wanted to possess him. So how could Lin Yun possibly let the cauldron off so easily?

When he activated his Blue Dragon Bone, a hundred thousand dragon runes appeared above the dragon origin ocean. They were like an army of a hundred thousand, strengthening the sword aura of the Netherflower. He was determined to teach the cauldron a lesson today, no matter what.

Spit it out! Lin Yun inwardly roared.

The trembling cauldron finally couldn’t take it, and boundless light started gushing out. That was the divine runes’ highly purified energies, which made the two saint runes insane within his profound palace. The Golden Crow and Silver Phoenix Saint Runes were like bottomless black holes devouring the divine runes’ energies, and Lin Yun could sense his mental cultivation snowballing.

In the blink of an eye, he reached the pinnacle of the seventh-stage Saint Spiritualist. But before he could respond, he easily broke through the bottleneck and reached the eighth-stage Saint Spiritualist. Under the control of his two saint runes, his massive mental energy was condensed into eight dazzling stars.

“Fuck! This bastard!” Lin Yun couldn’t help cursing because he found out the cauldron devoured ninety-nine percent of the divine runes’ energy that he had absorbed over the past seven days. Just a moment ago, he was just rejoicing that the nine saint lotuses couldn’t compete over him, but it was no wonder why he didn’t make any breakthrough in his mental cultivation.

“Not enough!” Lin Yun roared. The Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron tried to struggle free and escape, but a hundred thousand dragon runes were like shackles descending from the sky, binding the cauldron. Then, the Netherflower transmitted sword intent through the restraints.

After he managed to suppress the cauldron, he used his sword intent to slam into it again and again, wanting it to spit out all of the divine runes’ energy that it absorbed.

A long time later, two streaks of light flew out. They were the heavenly dragon and divine phoenix that were previously devoured by the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron. Through this period of nurturing, the heavenly dragon and divine phoenix became even more vivid and stronger than before.

Lin Yun rejoiced because he could sense that when the heavenly dragon and divine phoenix rose to the sky of the dragon origin ocean, his dragon origin ocean began to grow.

Just when he relaxed, the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron finally managed to break free from the shackles and dove into the dragon origin ocean. Looking at it, the corner of Lin Yun’s lips twitched because the cauldron submitted. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

After the cauldron sank to the bottom of the ocean, he controlled the Netherflower to descend to the dragon origin ocean.

This is my Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron and Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon now… Lin Yun inwardly muttered. Although he couldn’t control the cauldron entirely, it should be easier for him to handle it in the future.

“Continue to devour!” Lin Yun’s confidence was significantly boosted. Now that he had dealt with the cauldron, it was time for him to deal with the nine saint lotuses. The saint lotuses weren’t easy opponents either because they had fought him for the past seven days and seven nights, trying to suck him dry.

In his heart, the divine runes’ energies were great nourishment. In the saint lotuses’ eyes, Lin Yun was also their greatest nourishment since he possessed the Blue Dragon Bone, which produced vitality for him.

Just when Lin Yun was going to go for it, a piece of fragile information flowed into his mind from the saint lotuses. The information needed to be clearer with a complete sentence of words. This was a primitive method of mental transmission, and Lin Yun could roughly understand the information. The nine lotuses were reaching their limit, hoping Lin Yun wouldn’t use the cauldron again.

They were already struggling, to begin with. So when Lin Yun reached the eighth-stage Saint Spiritualist, and his Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon reached the sixth stage, the saint lotuses finally couldn’t hold on any longer. The nine saint lotuses possessed simple intelligence, but they were primitive. They were one, but they were also individual entities.

“No need to beg for mercy. As long as you guys don’t try and absorb my vitality at once, I won’t use the cauldron.” Lin Yun said. The Nine Lotus Diagram might not be able to suck him dry, but it would significantly exhaust his vitality if all of them initiated the absorption at the same time, and he couldn’t be genuinely refined by the altar. The moment he got any benefits, they were devoured by the saint lotuses.

His words made the saint lotuses happy, and Lin Yun could hear the birds chipping. The flames enveloping him also slowly weakened.

Before Lin Yun could even respond while sitting on the Nine Lotus Diagram, ripples began to spread out on the painting, and Lin Yun slowly entered it. When he came to his senses, he discovered that he was at a pond.

Lin Yun instantly understood that the Nine Lotus Diagram displayed goodwill to him. Cultivating here was more convenient than when he was outside the painting.

“You guys want me to cultivate here?” Lin Yun asked, looking at the nine lotuses.

As the nine lotuses swayed as though they were nodding their heads, Lin Yun smiled, “Who’s first?”

As the saint lotuses swayed, the nine lotuses were conversing amongst themselves. In the end, a white lotus floated over like a bashful girl. Lin Yun wanted to reach out at the white lotus by instinct when it came before him. But the white lotus was alarmed and retreated.

Looking at this, Lin Yun smiled, “Alright, I won’t touch you. So don’t be afraid.”

But the white lotus didn’t seem to believe him and waited for a long time before slowly approaching Lin Yun.

“Interesting…” Lin Yun smiled and started cultivating. The effect was more significant than he had imagined, and the lake was filled with an unimaginable amount of divine rune energy.

Lin Yun devoured the surrounding divine rune energy with the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon. Not only could it strengthen his mental cultivation, but his physique and cultivation were also growing.

Perhaps I can try and reach the sixth stage in my cultivation. Lin Yun inwardly muttered.

As time passed, half a month passed in the blink of an eye. On the summit of the snowy mountain, Yue Weiwei and Mu Xueling were chatting amongst themselves.

“Senior Sister, isn’t Big Brother Lin great? He’s still inside!” Yue Weiwei smiled.

Mu Xueling was reading a book, and she replied, “He’ll have to spend at least a few days to ascend the Golden Crow Altar. He will need a few more days to stand firmly before the Nine Lotus Diagram. He should still be cultivating on the altar, but it won’t be easy to control the Nine Lotus Diagram. Who knows? Perhaps he might not have officially started yet.”

“Is that so?” Yue Weiwei asked.

“Don't worry about it. Do you think I’ll bluff you? He’ll come out by himself in less than ten days. The Nine Lotus Diagram isn’t something that just anyone can withstand!” Mu Xueling indifferently lowered the book.

“Senior Sister, do you want to make a bet with me?” Yue Weiwei smiled.

“What bet?” Mu Xueling asked. After hearing what Yue Weiwei said, Mu Xueling asked, “You sure you’ll go back to the divine mountain and obediently be the holy maiden when you lose? The price of this bet is a little on the higher side. After all, it wasn’t easy for you to come out.”

“I believe in Big Brother Lin!” Yue Weiwei replied.

“Okay.” Mu Xueling agreed to the bet without any hesitation. She was confident that she wouldn’t lose.

“Then, Senior Sister isn’t allowed to go back on your words if you lose.” Yue Weiwei winked, and a cunning light flashed across her pupils.
