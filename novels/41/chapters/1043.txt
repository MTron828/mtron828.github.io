Chapter 1044 - Final Lap

There were only ten days left until the Demon Slaughtering Assembly and Lin Yun was still in seclusion. Many people had already left for Wind Mound City because none of them wanted to miss out on such a great event .

After all, Lin Yun was a heaven-defying genius swordsman that three Realm Sons were scheming against. Everyone pitied Lin Yun because they were certain he was throwing his life away. However, if Lin Yun didn’t show up, he would have a demon in his heart forever. It would prevent his cultivation from ever improving. To someone as proud as Lin Yun, a lifetime in the same cultivation was worse than death.

But even so, they wanted to watch the fall of a legend with their own eyes. There were also many people who didn’t head over to the gathering point. Since the Realm Sons couldn’t do anything in the Four Phase City, many people stayed behind assuming that Lin Yun would hide. After all, no one would eagerly face death head-on.

Back in Lin Yun’s courtyard, he was still in secluded cultivation. Naturally, he had no idea what was going on outside. He was refining the True Dragon Saint Liquid to cultivate the Azure Dragon Saint Art. Luo Chen helped him purchase 17 droplets of True Dragon Saint Liquid. Lin Yun even devoured ten droplets at once.

When he refined the Bloodflame Pellets earlier to practice the Divine Solar Lunar Fist, the pellets tempered his physique. Although they only tempered his vitality, his vitality was crucial to having a strong physique.

Enveloped in a boundless dragon aura, the violent storm made heaven and earth quake. Lin Yun practically shaved off two years of cultivating by refining ten droplets of True Dragon Saint Liquid. It was an explosive improvement that made his bones crackle like lightning.

His physique was currently undergoing a transformation under the influence of the True Dragon Saint Liquid. At the same time, Lin Yun discovered some secrets of the Azure Dragon True Bone.

The radiance that enveloped the divine rune looked like a barrier that sealed the Azure Dragon True Bone. As the divine rune’s radiance began to dissolve, the Azure Dragon True Bone also gradually began to appear. Lin Yun could sense the powerful vitality and energy contained in the bone.

The power of the Azure Dragon True Bone was so powerful that Lin Yun needed more strength to control it. Now, if anyone wanted to take the Azure Dragon True bone from him, they would be injured by the power of the divine rune.

When Lin Yun looked carefully, the Azure Dragon True Bone had a total of ten barriers. Each barrier was stronger than the previous one. Additionally, he would obtain a portion of the Azure Dragon True Bone’s power with every barrier that he unlocked. If he could unlock all ten barriers, he would come in contact with the true power of the Azure Dragon True Bone.

This was the arrangement provided by the Azure Dragon Lord. His intention was for Lin Yun to gradually grasp the power of the Azure Dragon True Bone. Coincidentally, the Azure Dragon Saint Art also had a total of ten stages.

“I’m currently in the first stage of the Azure Dragon Saint Art, which means that I’ll need to reach the second stage to unlock the first barrier. I wonder if ten drops of True Dragon Saint Liquid is enough…” Lin Yun pondered inwardly.

An hour later after Lin Yun refined one droplet of True Dragon Saint Liquid, which caused the first barrier to loosen up. Four hours later, he had refined three droplets and the barrier finally broke. But after that, his refinement speed began to slow down. Then again, Lin Yun wasn’t in a hurry because the power contained in the True Dragon Saint Liquid was strong.

Refining ten droplets at once was Lin Yun’s limit. Half a day later, Lin Yun finished refining all ten drops. He could sense that he had made a breakthrough in the Azure Dragon Saint Art. Meanwhile, boundless vitality surged in his body while his purple-golden dragon runes grew to 15.

“I have 15 purple-golden dragon runes. I bet the Azure Dragon Saint Armor is a lot stronger now.” Lin Yun squinted his eyes with a desire to check his improvements.

With a single thought, Lin Yun summoned the Azure Dragon Saint Armor with 15 purple-golden runes. Compared to the past, the Azure Dragon Saint Armor was clearly a lot stronger than before.

Now, if anyone wanted to injure him, they would have to destroy all 15 dragon runes. This alone had greatly boosted Lin Yun’s ability to protect himself. At the same time, Lin Yun discovered the powerful current around the dragon runes that would punish his opponent if they couldn’t destroy his runes.

“This can be considered a trump card of mine. How nice, it combines offense with defense.” Lin Yun revealed a satisfied expression and dispelled the Azure Dragon Saint Armor. Then, 15 dragon runes gathered in his right hand while he created a terrifying vortex, “Azure Dragon Grasp!”

When Lin Yun reached out with his hand, he grabbed a pavilion a thousand meters away. When the pavilion flew over, it began to crumble.

Countless specks of sand drifted in the wind, which meant that Lin Yun was at the second stage of the Azure Dragon Saint Art.

Suddenly, the true bone in his chest began to tremble. The first barrier on the Azure Dragon True Bone was slowly disappearing. “It’s coming!”

Lin Yun knew that the first barrier on the Azure Dragon True Bone would break when he reached the second stage in the Azure Dragon Saint Art. When the barrier finally broke, a wisp of ancient dragon aura began to pour out from the Azure Dragon True Bone. It was the dragon energy belonging to the azure dragon when it was alive, similar to human cultivators’ origin energy, except for the fact that the origin energy refined by the azure dragon was a lot stronger.

As boundless energy began to fill his body, Lin Yun started to float in the air. At the same time, his bottleneck in the third soul Heavenly Soul Realm was broken and his cultivation reached the fourth soul Heavenly Soul Realm while a new aura ocean appeared. The entire process was so overbearing that it caught Lin Yun by surprise.

At the same time, thunderclouds began to gather above Lin Yun. Fear flashed in his eyes because a Demonic Astral Flower had appeared.

“Great, at least I won’t die with this dragon energy around.” Lin Yun’s eyes flickered as he suppressed the fear in his heart. If he was careful, he might be able to plant another Demonic Astral Flower in his aura ocean. It was an insane thought, but it would help him out a lot.

He was a lot stronger than before and the holy spirit martial technique allowed him to undergo a transformation. On top of that, his sky sword intent had reached greater mastery. He might be able to face the hundreds of Demonic Astral Flowers in the sky with his current strength.

Each flower was dangerous, so Lin Yun didn’t dare to underestimate them. He had to weaken the Demonic Astral Flowers before refining them. If he made a single mistake, it could cause the destruction of an aura ocean and his cultivation would fall.

“Come on!” Lin Yun wore a grave expression as a Golden Crow and Silver Phoenix flew out of his body and towards the Demonic Astral Flowers. At the same time, sky sword intent began to accumulate in his pupils while 15 dragon runes squirmed on the surface of his body.

Other than his martial souls, Lin Yun had brought out all of his trump cards. While Lin Yun underwent his tribulation, Lil’ Red did the same.

It had eaten all the treasures in its interspatial pouch and with the cultivation technique given by Yue Weiwei, it had reached a crucial point. If it could make a breakthrough, Lil’ Red would be able to execute the Ancient Dracoape transformation. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Lin Yun and Lil’ Red were giving it their all for the promise they made. At this moment, the two brothers had the same goal!
