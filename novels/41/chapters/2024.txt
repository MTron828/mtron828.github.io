Chapter 2025 - Fight

Ye Qingtian’s appearance caused an uproar in the surroundings. After all, he had defeated Young Master Wushuang and had an ambiguous relationship with the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden. Many people had heard of his name and knew that a talented swordsman had appeared within the Heavenly Dao Sect. But not many people took him too seriously.

Xin Yan was surprised that Ye Qingtian really showed up, and she couldn’t help turning to look at Wang Muyan.

Wang Muyan smiled in response. She wasn’t surprised by Ye Qingtian’s arrival and smiled, “Junior Brother Ye, I knew that you’d come because of Senior Sister and the Heavenly Dao Sect’s reputation.”

“I have to thank Holy Maiden for telling me about it,” Lin Yun said deeply.

“You’re welcome,” Wang Muyan smiled. Others would only take it as if they had a good relationship, but they didn’t know the deeper meaning of their words.

Xin Yan said nothing, but Jin Xuanyi was practically invincible amongst the same generation based on the strength he displayed so far. Jin Xuanyi’s strength was deep and unfathomable. He was a lot stronger than Nangong Fuye. But even so, Nangong Fuye couldn’t even force Jin Xuanyi to bring out his trump cards, and everyone only knew that he had received the Lightning Qilin’s inheritance.

Furthermore, Jin Xuanyi was also famed for being ruthless. Xin Yan was confident that she might be able to protect herself against Jin Xuanyi, but it was another question with Ye Qingtian.

But Xin Yan shook her head and said, “I was the one who lost the Divine Blood Flower. Let me handle this battle. Even if I lose, you can win for me in the future.”

“In the future?” Lin Yun continued, “It’s just one Jin Xuanyi, and I don’t have to wait long to deal with him. So you can feel assured, Senior Sister. I’ve obtained so many benefits from the Serene Dust Great Saint. So allow me to repay her.”

Wang Muyan rolled her eyes and looked at an old man before she said, “Elder Shi Feng, Ye Qingtian obtained great benefits in the Myriad Graves Valley. With him around, I’m confident we can regain the Divine Blood Flower.”

When Lin Yun turned his gaze over, he noticed there was a Quasi-Saint elder within the party. But this made him curious about how a Quasi-Saint could be in the God Burial Mountain Range. But he soon found the reason. It was forbidden for Quasi-Saints to enter the God Burial Mountain Range, but that wouldn't stop someone at the ninth transformation of the Nirvana Stage from making a breakthrough.

With the holy lands’ means, they could dispatch many older generation saint disciples into the God Burial Mountain Range, and one could surely make a breakthrough. When Lin Yun swept his gaze around, he noticed the other holy lands had Quasi-Saints around.

But Shi Feng didn’t care much and asked, “Ye Qingtian, are you really confident in seizing the Divine Blood Flower back?”

“Yeah.” Lin Yun knew it was hard to convince Xin Yan, but he could convince this Quasi-Saint.

Shi Feng’s face changed, but he kept his silence. Since they were determined to lose, he would rather let Ye Qingtian enter the arena rather than Xin Yan. After all, the Serene Dust Great Saint would come after him if anything happened to Xin Yan.

But he didn’t have that concern with Ye Qingtian. After all, Ye Qingtian’s reputation was ruined within the Heavenly Dao Sect, not to mention he was the one who wanted to go to the arena on behalf of Xin Yan.

Shi Feng soon decided and turned to look at Ye Qingtian, “Ye Qingtian, you can enter the arena. I have heard of your name. Many people say you only know how to show off in the sect. So this is a perfect opportunity for you to prove yourself.”

Wang Yue and Chen Zhong widened their mouths and were dumbfounded. There was such a saying within the sect, and many saint disciples were unhappy with Ye Qingtian. But it was too much for Ye Qingtian to prove himself against Jin Xuanyi.

“Thank you for your trust, Elder.” Lin Yun glanced at Shi Feng before entering the arena.

“Ye Qingtian!” Xin Yan called out to him with a hint of rage within her pupils. She didn’t like how this was going. She might seem optimistic, but she was a prideful person and a thorny rose. When she decided on something, she didn’t like someone changing it.

Lin Yun turned around and smiled, “Can you call me ‘Junior Brother’? Senior Sister once said that you only have one Junior Brother, who faced the entire world for you. I also have a Senior Sister, and she’s actually standing right before me.”

Xin Yan was stunned when she heard that, and her eyes blurred.

Lin Yun turned around and went to the arena, just like when he faced the whole world back then. “Since ancient times, love has always been unforgettable.”

“Ye Qingtian, you’re really slow. If we had fought, you would’ve died a hundred times.” Jin Xuanyi said in disdain. He didn’t place Ye Qingtian in his eyes at all. He was a genius who received the Qilin’s inheritance, not to mention a Golden Era was arriving soon. Thus, Jin Xuanyi couldn’t be bothered to conceal himself any longer.

“You’ll know later if my sword is slow,” Lin Yun smiled.

Jin Xuanyi wasn’t bothered by what Ye Qingtian said. He summoned a sword and looked at Lin Yun, “You’re not worthy of making me draw my sword. But I heard you’re a genius swordsman within the Heavenly Dao Sect, so I’ll face you with my sword. Let me see how shameless the Heavenly Dao Sect is to claim you’re a genius swordsman!”

Shi Feng’s face sank when he heard that, and he regretted letting Ye Qingtian enter the arena. If Ye Qingtian terribly lost or begged for mercy, the Heavenly Dao Sect would be greatly humiliated.

The other holy lands couldn’t help laughing when they heard that. They only treated Ye Qingtian as a joke, and no one took him seriously.

“This is a great opportunity to see how capable this ‘genius’ swordsman is!” The one who spoke was Jiu Yang, a Quasi-Saint from the Ming Cult. The Ming Cult had a terrible relationship with the Heavenly Dao Sect, so they naturally stood out to mock the Heavenly Dao Sect.

Standing beside him was a hooded old man, looking unfathomable and eerie.

“This person is a lecher who peeked at the holy maiden showering. He was expelled from the Heavenly Dao Sect, so I don’t know where he got the face to return.” Ming cult’s Zhang Yiling poured oil onto the flame, exposing Ye Qingtian’s deeds within the Heavenly Dao Sect.

Hearing that, Shi Feng’s face became red, but he didn’t dare to say a word.

“Hahaha!” Zhang Ziling and Jiu Yang laughed, causing the other holy lands to chatter.

On the stage, Jin Xuanyi had already started his fight with Lin Yun.

“Ye Qingtian, let me show you what a swordsman is today!” Jin Xuanyi flicked his finger, and the saint sword in his hand flew out like a lightning bolt. His sword streaked across the horizon and disappeared before everyone.

This surprised Lin Yun because Jin Xuanyi was manipulating his sword from afar, which meant Jin Xuanyi was stronger than most swordsmen within the Heavenly Dao Sect. Then again, Jin Xuanyi was nothing compared to him. With a single thought, the Flower Burial Sword also flew out. He, too, was manipulating his sword from afar.

As sparks flew, the two swords began to clash amongst themselves. When the two swords trembled, Lin Yun divided his sword into two and unleashed countless sword rays from his body. A sword aura storm flew out, and it dashed forth like a dragon when Lin Yun flicked his finger, wanting to devour Jin Xuanyi like a dragon.

“Not bad.” Jin Xuanyi immediately analyzed that Lin Yun’s attainment in the sword was much higher than his.

“Come back!” Jin Xuanyi smiled and reached out to grab the saint sword. As he circulated all the nirvana aura within his body, he swung his sword forth, pouring all of his cultivation into the sword and created a massive sword aura.

“This is only an appetizer.” Jin Xuanyi dashed forth to suppress Lin Yun.

But a sword ray flew out from the Flower Burial Sword. It was like a crescent moon that was aiming for Jin Xuanyi’s chest.

“What a pitiful trick.” Jin Xuanyi had no change on his face, wanting to knock Lin Yun’s sword away. But the Flower Burial Sword suddenly stopped, and Jin Xuanyi’s sword missed. After Jin Xuanyi was done raising his sword, the Flower Burial Sword stabbed forth with an even faster speed, targeting Jin Xuanyi’s chest.Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Radiant Moon Heart!” Lin Yun stood in the same spot as he pushed his palm forth, with the Divine Firefly Sword technique’s sword aura empowering the Flower Burial Sword. It was like a giant descending from the sky, grabbing the Flower Burial Sword.

The Flower Burial Sword easily tore apart Jin Xuanyi’s nirvana aura and reached him.

This forced Jin Xuanyi to retreat before thrusting his sword forth and facing the Flower Burial Sword head-on. Two sword auras exploded from Jin Xuanyi and Lin Yun as their sword intents caused the entire arena to tremble.

Under the two massive powers, the arena began to shake, and it would fall apart if saint runes didn’t empower it.

Jin Xuanyi took a deep breath and circulated his nirvana aura. He relied on his powerful cultivation to knock the Flower Burial Sword away before swinging his sword. The Flower Burial Sword was knocked away like a ball, making Jin Xuanyi heave a breath of relief.

He quickly stepped forth, wanting to use this opportunity to end the battle.

But the Flower Burial Sword suddenly flew forth, splitting into twelve afterimages as it dashed again. Each sword left behind an afterimage that formed a halo, enveloping Jin Xuanyi.

“How is this possible?!” Jin Xuanyi was shocked. He couldn’t believe anyone could reach such a height in manipulating the sword.

He tried his best to dodge, but three swords still attacked him. As Jin Xuanyi took several steps back to stabilize himself, he exclaimed in shock, “Myriad Swords Unite! You can execute Myriad Swords Unite with sword manipulation?!”

Lin Yun waved his sword and grabbed the Flower Burial Sword.

“How far have you reached in your sword attainment?” Jin Xuanyi asked.

“That’s a secret,” Lin Yun replied. It was a pity earlier because he had the opportunity to inflict heavy injuries on Jin Xuanyi.

But Jin Xuanyi’s movement technique was too powerful, and it wasn’t at all inferior to his Divine Sunchasing Art. Jin Xuanyi could instantly change his direction and even left behind fluctuations in the surrounding air when he moved. So Jin Xuanyi had managed to avoid all the attacks targeted at his vitals.

Jin Xuanyi and Ye Qingtian only briefly fought, leaving everyone dumbfounded. No one thought Ye Qingtian could obtain the advantage in his fight with Jin Xuanyi. This scene was too unbelievable for them, and they now knew why Ye Qingtian was called a genius swordsman within the Heavenly Dao Sect. Most importantly, Ye Qingtian didn’t move a single step throughout the fight.
