Chapter 1005 - Somewhat Relieved

Within Lin Yun’s consciousness, neither Lin Yun nor the demonic spirit dared to move upon seeing the ancient ice phoenix. Compared to Lin Yun, the demonic spirit was enveloped with fear because he recognized the origin of the ice phoenix. Naturally, he knew how terrifying it was. If he could do everything over right now, he wouldn’t risk invading Lin Yun’s consciousness.

As for Lin Yun, he was more shocked than terrified because he never expected to find an ice phoenix sleeping in his consciousness. Although the ‘broken sword’ within his body had a mysterious origin, he knew that it wouldn’t harm him. On the other hand, the ice phoenix made Lin Yun feel a chill down his spine. He had a feeling that the ice phoenix could possess his body if it wanted to.

Under this stalemate, the demonic spirit couldn’t contain his fear anymore. Sneaking a peek at the ice phoenix, the demonic spirit retracted his aura and slowly retreated. At this moment, he no longer dared to control Lin Yun’s body.

Suddenly, space began to tremble violently as the ice phoenix released a terrifying aura. When the aura was released, Lin Yun was shocked to discover that he had been completely restricted.

“N-n-no! S-senior, I have no intention of disturbing you!” The demonic spirit immediately started begging for his life. But his effort was futile as the ice phoenix slowly opened its eyes. The moment it opened its eyes, the demonic spirit instantly blew apart and disappeared. He had completely disappeared from Lin Yun’s consciousness, which shocked Lin Yun greatly. Lin Yun was filled with uneasiness because he had no idea what the ice phoenix would do to him.

“Get lost. Chosen one, don’t disrupt my sleep before you can wake me up. What a bastard…my beautiful dream…I really want to gobble you up…” A clear female voice sounded in Lin Yun’s ears. After the ice phoenix was done speaking, it fell asleep once more.

Eat me? Lin Yun retreated from his consciousness with great shock. When he regained control of his body, he couldn’t find Yu Haotian anywhere. Pei Xue was the only one standing in front of him.

“You’re awake? Are you Lin Yun or…?” Pei Xue looked at Lin Yun with uneasiness.

“Do I seem like someone who can be possessed so easily?” Lin Yun smiled, which relieved Pei Xue.

“Where’s Yu Haotian?” Lin Yun asked. What he experienced in his consciousness was shocking, but Lin Yun had other things to prioritize. Based on what he saw, that ice phoenix had no enmity towards him. If the ice phoenix wanted to kill him, there was no way he would be alive right now.

He could tell that the ice phoenix wasn’t in its complete form, so he didn’t need to be afraid. Plus, he was certain that the ice phoenix was connected to the Iris Sword Saint. So rather than worrying about the ice phoenix, Lin Yun needed to focus on Yu Haotian. He had already resolved half the threat by killing the demonic spirit, but he couldn’t feel relieved until Yu Haotian was dead.

“He left, but your demonic pet chased after him along with Luo Chen’s group. With his injuries, he shouldn’t have gotten far,” replied Pei Xue.

“Don’t be so sure about that!” Lin Yun said as he began to form seals with his hands. Then, boundless light began to converge behind him to form a pair of golden wings. He looked just like the golden winged human from the Divine Glorysun Fist, although he was a lot weaker. Then again, it was more than enough for Lin Yun. When the golden wings flapped, Lin Yun disappeared in front of Pei Xue.

“What speed! His speed isn’t inferior to my Cloud Rising Step…” Pei Xue was surprised. Purple light began to distort around her as she chased after Lin Yun.

After Lin Yun executed the Golden Crow Nine Transformations, he pushed his speed to the limit. It didn’t take long for him to reach Luo Chen’s group and Lil’ Red. They were standing outside of a region with demonic clouds. When Lin Yun arrived, he could sense some terror from the region and realized that it was a forbidden zone, which was quite common in the Heavenly Path.

“Lin Yun?” Luo Chen’s group greeted Lin Yun when they saw him descend from the sky.

“Yeah. Are you guys sure Yu Haotian ran in there?” Lin Yun asked.

“Yeah. But this is a forbidden zone and we don’t dare to take the risk. We’ve been guarding this area the whole time and he hasn’t come out yet. He must’ve died in there,” replied Luo Chen.

“We have to double check his body. I have to make sure he’s dead,” said Lin Yun.

“Don’t! This has been a forbidden zone since ancient times. I heard that even Divine Core Realm experts will be trapped to death in it. No one has ever come out of it since ancient times.” Luo Chen’s group immediately stopped Lin Yun from trying to go in. After all, they knew more information about the Heavenly Path than Lin Yun.

“He’s right. A long time ago, two incredible powerhouses fought here and dyed this space with misfortune.” Purple light distorted as Pei Xue appeared.

“I won’t go in. I’m just going to take a look.” Lin Yun could sense a strange aura from this forbidden zone that could corrode lives.

Without any hesitation, Lin Yun executed the divine ability of the Aurora Dragon, Aurora Dragon Eyes. As flames began to blaze in his pupils, his sight broke through the demonic clouds and he could see many corpses lying on the ground. The corpses looked rather recent. Clearly, these geniuses went in despite knowing how dangerous it was. However, the sheer number of corpses lying on the ground sent shivers down his spine.

When he finally found Yu Haotian, Lin Yun saw him lying on the ground with his eyes wide open and his heart split in half. Lin Yun could also see a trace of blood dripping out of Yu Haotian’s eyes. Shutting his eyes, Lin Yun said, “He’s dead. Even his heart was split in two.”

When everyone heard what he said, they let out a sigh of relief. After all, Yu Haotian was too terrifying and none of them wanted to see him alive. But all of a sudden, boundless sword intent exploded out from Lin Yun, which shocked everyone. When they turned to look at Lin Yun, their eyes were filled with shock because Lin Yun was using his sky sword intent.

Before they could even react, Lin Yun tapped his interspatial pouch and retrieved an old sword. Instead of grabbing it, he controlled it with his sword intent. He poured his sky sword intent into the ordinary sword, making it shine with cold light.

When the sword ray accumulated enough power, the sword flew into the forbidden zone. Then, the sword stabbed the center of Yu Haotian’s forehead, piercing his skull and pinning him into the ground.

Luo Chen and the rest sucked in a cold breath because Lin Yun was too terrifying. However, they failed to understand that Lin Yun couldn’t be relieved without making sure that Yu Haotian was dead. After all, Yu Haotian had threatened him time and time again. No matter the lengths, Lin Yun had to make sure. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

As time passed, the demonic clouds closed up and covered up Yu Haotian’s corpse. Right at this moment, Lil’ Red came over and tossed Yu Haotian’s interspatial pouch and glove towards Lin Yun.

Lin Yun’s eyes lit up because he was afraid that Yu Haotian took his fortune and artifacts into the forbidden zone. Now, he could combine the Divine Glorymoon Fist with the Divine Glorysun Fist to form the Divine Solar Lunar Fist. With a smile, Lin Yun caught the interspatial pouch.
