Chapter 1773 – The Radiant Snow Flower Never Withers!

This was an outcome no one had expected. They didn’t expect the dull-looking and insignificant Zhao Yan to defeat Cheng Xiong, especially with the last sword. No one could understand that sword.

Under his bamboo hat, Lin Yun nodded his head because Zhao Yan didn’t disappoint him.

“Interesting…” Holy lands geniuses like Ji Lingfeng’s eyes lit up when they saw this sword.

“Sword Sect’s Zhao Yan is grateful for the battle.” Zhao Yan had no intention of leaving after defeating his opponent. He looked around and asked, “Does anyone else wish to fight me?”

“Let me face you. I’m Yuan Hao of the Ghostcloud Sect!” This person looked to be in his thirties and had a robust figure. He was the senior disciple of Cheng Xiong.

“Come!” Zhao Yan didn’t waste any time and merely greeted with his sword.

As Yuan Hao soared to the sky, a massive ghost appeared behind him with his hand descending on Zhao Yan. The palm of the gigantic ghost also came descending on Zhao Yan, and a huge shadow enveloped the sky, causing the Thunderblood Battlestage to tremble.

“Heaven Sword Form!” Zhao Yan swung his sword out, and his dull pupils changed to a sharp gaze. He unleashed thirty-six sword rays, tearing the huge palm into pieces before forming a descending ‘Heaven’ word.

Simultaneously, his Firmament Sword Intent became rampant, which made the ‘Heaven’ word even more terrifying. This made Yuan Hao lightly lock his brows before he gave a kick, and the massive ghost behind him landed on the ‘Heaven’ word. Everyone could hear the sounds of heaven shattering.

“Earth Sword Form!” Before Yuan Hao could catch his breath, Zhao Yan dashed forth with his sword, unleashing multiple sword rays from the sky.

After executing the Earth Sword Form, the surrounding gravity multiplied, significantly slowing down Yuan Hao’s bizarre movement technique. That was especially the case for the massive ghost who looked like it was in a quagmire.

“Heaven and Earth!” Ten-odd moves later, Zhao Yan turned around as the ‘Heaven’ and ‘Earth’ words overlapped together. The surrounding space began to distort, and his sword pierced through the air.

Under the empowerment of the various phenomena, the massive ghost started to crumble. A hundred moves later, Yuan Hao gradually reached his limit. His cultivation might be higher than Cheng Xiong, and he should’ve easily suppressed Zhao Yan, who was at the seventh-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, but as time passed, Yuan Hao gradually fell into a disadvantageous position.

“The Carefree 9 Swords! That’s the sword technique used by Flower Burial!”

“Who is this person?”

“He’s just a nobody who knows a part of Flower Burial’s sword techniques, but he can already force Yuan Hao into such a pathetic state. If Flower Burial was the one using it, how powerful would it be?”

“This person isn’t simple, and his Carefree 9 Swords seems more majestic. He’s is different from Flower Burial.” Soon enough, everyone was shocked when they recognized the sword technique performed by Zhao Yan.

There was much information about Lin Yun after that battle outside the Ancient Barren Battlefield, and many things about him were mythicized. The sword technique used by him was naturally spread out as well.

Lin Yun was known as a peerless genius in the sword for the past millennium, and many swordsmen researched his sword dao. So everyone was familiar with the Carefree 9 Swords that he used on multiple occasions.

When Lin Yun heard the surrounding discussions, he couldn’t help rejoicing. He never used the Carefree 9 Swords with his identity as Lin Xiao.

But he was impressed by Zhao Yan. He didn’t expect the latter could reach such heights in the four swords he passed on to him, but that was Zhao Yan. If it was someone else, it was practically impossible for them to grasp those four swords without the guidance of the Radiant Sword Saint.

Lin Yun also knew he had to find an opportunity to hand the remaining five to Zhao Yan. He only knew the first four sword forms back then, so he couldn’t teach the remaining five. With Zhao Yan’s talent, it would be a huge waste if he didn’t practice those other five swords.

“Go down!” Zhao Yan became even more ferocious as he fought. When he executed his sword technique, a massive sword aura was combined and brought his sword dao to a new level.

Facing his attack, Yuan Hao threw out a mouthful of blood before he could stabilize himself after taking five steps back.

“You lost.” Zhao Yan said, standing with his sword.

“Okay. Yuan Hao, you can go down now.” The Autumn Mountain Lord announced, seeing that Yuan Hao wasn’t convinced by his loss and still wanted to fight.

Yuan Hao also knew that his odds of winning were low if he continued to fight. He was practically invincible as long as he could find a way to deal with Zhao Yan’s sword techniques.

As for Zhao Yan, he continued to fight another six rounds with the Carefree 9 Swords, winning all six battles. His ranking on the Dragon Pulse Realm also skyrocketed because of it, making it into the top thousandths.

After six battles, a commotion broke out from the surroundings, and Zhao Yan became famous. Even the holy lands geniuses began to look at him thoughtfully.

“That sword technique is really powerful, and I can’t find a way to deal with it.” The Blue Frost Lord of the Four Young Masters said with his brows furrowed.

“I, on the other hand, wish to experience this sword technique in the hands of Flower Burial. I want to see how powerful it is.” The Autumn Mountain Lord smiled. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The other young masters also nodded their heads because the name “Flower Burial” itself represented a legend. He clearly went into hiding, but there were still legends around him. His name was even mentioned multiple times at this Martial Dao Tea Party.

Vaguely, his fame was already catching up to Jian Jingtian, who was first on the three rankings. But everyone felt fortunate because Lin Yun chose a path of death and wouldn’t show himself for at least a decade. There were even rumors that he had already died.

“You’re not the only one from the Sword Sect, right? That’s too boring if that’s the case. Let me face you.” A person stood up. When everyone saw this person, they took a cold breath and were shocked because this person was ranked in the top two hundredths on the Dragon Pulse Ranking, Ming Cult’s Yan Xiao!

They were shocked that a genius from a holy land finally stood out, but the difference in their ranking was too significant, and this was no different from bullying.

“Zhao Yan, let me face him!” Right then, Ye Ziling stood out. She wanted everyone to change their opinion of the Sword Sect. The Sword Sect might not be comparable to before after losing Jian Jingtian and Lin Yun, but that didn’t mean they had no one else. Even when facing a genius of a holy land, the Sword Sect’s geniuses could also fight them!

“How beautiful!”

“The Sword Sect has such beauty? Unbelievable…”

“Just being beautiful has no meaning because this Martial Dao Tea Party speaks with strength, not beauty.”

“She’s pretty confident. Does she think she’s stronger than Zhao Yan? I don’t believe it!” When Ye Ziling stood out, her beauty captivated everyone’s attention, and their eyes soon turned to her legs.

She had a pair of fair and long legs. Even if she didn’t display them on purpose, they still captivated everyone’s attention. Even the Four Young Masters and the holy land geniuses couldn’t help being breathtaken.

“She’s Ye Ziling? It looks like Big Brother Lin has no lack of beauty around you.” Yue Weiwei smiled, looking at Ye Ziling.

Lin Yun already told her his story after they parted, so Yue Weiwei naturally had an impression of Ye Ziling. Even so, she couldn’t help being surprised when she saw Ye Ziling, especially those long legs that even she felt jealous of.

“That’s her. She’s the daughter of my senior brother.” Lin Yun replied.

Yue Weiwei nodded her head. She naturally knew about Lin Yun’s relationship with Ye Ziling, which was why she was curious about the latter.

“I like Flower Burial, which has nothing to do with Lin Yun. That’s what she said, right? Hehe, I like that character of hers.” Yue Weiwei adorably squinted her eyes.

Beneath his bamboo hat, Lin Yun smiled because he was also shocked when Ye Ziling told him that. When Zhao Yan saw Ye Ziling stepping forth, he nodded his head and sheathed his sword before returning.

Just when everyone’s attention was attracted to Ye Ziling, Zhao Yan’s gaze became dull once more, and he returned to his seat. This was drastically different from how he was on the stage.

“Why did a woman stand out?” Yan Xiao raised his brow upon seeing Ye Ziling. He smiled, “I don’t have a habit of hitting women. Get another person to come up, or get Zhao Yan to fight me after he’s done resting. I have no personal interest in the Sword Sect, and I’m only interested in the Carefree 9 Swords used by Flower Burial.”

“If Junior Brother was here, I’m afraid you wouldn’t even have the courage to say those words.” Ye Ziling replied.

“You think too highly of him. If he’s really here, it’d be a problem if he could make it into the top hundredth, not to mention the top ten.” Yan Xiao snorted when he heard the contempt in Ye Ziling’s tone.

“You don’t believe it? I’ll have some fun with you, then!” Yan Xiao didn’t think too highly of Flower Burial. He wanted to fight Zhao Yan to prove that there was nothing impressive about the Carefree 9 Swords. But he never expected Ye Ziling to stand out. Then again, it wouldn’t matter because he would first defeat her before forcing Zhao Yan to come out.

“Divine Radiance Annihilation!” Yan Xiao threw out a punch, and the blazing aura formed into a brilliant flow of waves. The dazzling radiance made his punch look like a beam of light streaking across the horizon.

The saint blood on the stage was ignited by the heatwave and began to burn. Under the reflection of the flames, a golden mark bloomed on Yan Xiao’s forehead that shone brightly like a sun.

Everyone was secretly alarmed and now knew how strong the holy land geniuses were. Even the thunderclouds in the sky became faint under this punch.

No one was optimistic about Ye Ziling, and they all felt that she would be defeated by this attack. Thus, they couldn’t help looking at her with pity in their pupils.

But surprisingly, Ye Ziling didn’t retreat when facing this punch. Instead, she drew her sword to face it head-on. When a sword ray shone on her sword, a dragon roar echoed, and this sword gave everyone a feeling that it could even split heaven and earth.

As the snow fell, her sword ray formed into a divine dragon. Not only did the dragon crush Yan Xiao’s attack, it also knocked Yan Xiao flying away.

When she stood on the stage that was covered in saint blood under the snow, a purple flower bloomed within her pupils, making her look aloof.
