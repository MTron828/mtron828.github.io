Chapter 1807 - Full of Treasures

When the Wind Edge Lord heard what Lin Yun said, his face sank with a murderous aura flashing within his pupils. He was furious that Lin Yun dared to be so arrogant despite facing death. If they were outside, he might not openly dare to do anything to him. But he didn’t have much reservation when he’s at the Black Tortoise Void Sea.

The Black Tortoise Void Sea was a forbidden zone, and it was normal for people to die. Since Lin Yun dared to come alone, he naturally had his confidence in doing so. But he was only at the eighth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, so there was no way Lin Yun could escape from his grasp.

Thinking about this, the Wind Edge Lord immediately calmed down. He smiled, “Lin Xiao, you’re a smart person. You won’t put your life at risk if you don’t have any confidence. But smart people often die faster. Do you know why I chased after you, despite knowing that you have trump cards?”

“I don’t care what a dead person thinks.” Lin Yun said, putting away the Divine Indigo Bamboo Flute.

The Wind Edge Lord’s face sank when he heard that, and coldly said, “Lin Xiao, you’re too arrogant. You’re too bloated just because you obtained first on the Nirvana Banquet and Dragon Pulse Ranking. You’re only first on the Dragon Pulse Ranking. You’re not invincible at the Dragon Pulse Realm, not to mention when facing someone at the Samsara Edict Realm!”

“You’re right.” Lin Yun replied.

As the Wind Edge Lord squinted his eyes, he eerily smiled, “Your indifference is really getting on my nerves. I suddenly don’t want to kill you now. I want to torture you and make you beg before me while I slowly break every single bone in your body.”

“Young Master, why waste time with someone like him? He’s just a small fry at the Dragon Pulse Realm. I’ll deal with him!” A Profound Life Stage expert stood out from behind the Wind Edge Lord.

This person’s name was Liu Hai, an elder of the Liu Saint Clan. Liu Hai was tall and robust, wielding a spear as he jumped off the Black Tortoise Ship to charge at Lin Yun.

The Wind Edge Lord’s face changed a little. Liu Hai was over a hundred years old, and his cultivation was at the second stage Profound Life Stage. Empowered by his profound life aura, Liu Hai’s dragon origin underwent a transformation, and it had far surpassed a mere cultivator at the Dragon Pulse Realm.

Even if Lin Yun was talented, he was only at the eighth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. He might be able to face someone who had just stepped into the Profound Life Stage, but it was practically impossible against Liu Hai, an expert of the Liu Saint Clan. So the Wind Edge Lord decided to let Liu Hai test Lin Yun’s strength and see his trump cards.

As Liu Hai stomped his foot on the sea, a huge wave was created as a crater appeared. When he flew forth like an arrow, the collapsed region on the sea bounced back up and created a thousand-foot wave.

The dragon origin within Liu Hai’s body was terrifying, not to mention it was further empowered by the profound life aura. So he simply dashed forth with the spear in his hand.

As the myriad rune saint artifact began to light up, it released a dazzling brilliance before he swept the spearhead forth. This created a terrifying current, wrapped in seawater forming into a wave that charged at Lin Yun. The wave wall was powerful, emitting a faint radiance, and slammed against Lin Yun. The huge wave knocked Lin Yun a few hundred meters away.

When Liu Hai charged out from the wave, he sneered, “Do you know how powerful a Samsara Edict Realm expert is now? This power is way beyond your imagination!”

He dashed over and shot his spear forth when Lin Yun landed. But Lin Yun dodged his attacks and managed to regain his footing after ten-odd moves before using the Flower Burial Sword to block Liu Hai’s spear. When the spear and sword collided, an explosion swept out.

Lin Yun took the initiative to retreat. Swinging his sword, the sword ray he unleashed manifested into a dragon’s claw that charged towards Liu Hai.

As a powerful gale swept behind Liu Hai, he shook his hand, “Nine Heavenly Gale Quake!”

His spear produced afterimages of his spear. When the afterimages overlapped together, the spear was thrust forth. When the saint spear flew over, it easily shattered the azure dragon’s claw. But that wasn’t all. Liu Hai was still emitting a terrifying, majestic aura and dashed over.

Lin Yun raised his head and stomped his foot on the ground before he retreated back by three feet and spun in mid-air with the Flower Burial Sword. When his sword moved, an azure dragon wrapped around him.

In a split second, the azure dragon condensed with dragon origin shattered, and Lin Yun was sent flying away. When Lin Yun descended, his heart throbbed violently with fine cracks appearing.

Many of the dragon runes on his chest shattered because he was injured. Fortunately, his injuries weren’t serious. When the Blue Dragon Bone emitted a faint blue energy, the cracks around his heart swiftly recovered.

“Lin Xiao, do you now know the drastic difference between you and the Samsara Edict Realm? So what if your dragon pulses are at ten thousand feet? You’re not much different from an ant before the Profound Life Stage.” The Wind Edge Lord smiled.

Liu Hai stood proudly with the spear in his hand. He was confident in winning. Facing a genius at the Dragon Pulse Realm, his sword intent was useless even if it was strong, and it was meaningless even if he had strong attainment in martial dao. Just the difference in one realm alone was enough to crush everything.

“Indeed, the second stage Profound Life Stage is stronger than I imagined.” Lin Yun said softly.

“You know now, but it's too late.” Liu Hai said indifferently.

“That’s not necessarily the case.” Lin Yun’s face changed. His gaze became sharp, and he released his Sword Heart.

Very quickly, Lin Yun’s sword intent began to rise, and all the spiritual energy within the surroundings was drawn by his Sword Heart. A dazzling silver radiance shone on his chest, and his invisible Sword Heart formed a shape.

Lin Yun’s aura swiftly broke through the restriction of the eighth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, soon reaching the Profound Life Stage. Ever since he grasped the Sword Heart, he had yet to reveal it before anyone. By releasing the Sword Heart, not only could it empower his sword intent, but it could also multiply the coverage of his Sword Heart.

“Sword Heart?!” Liu Hai’s face changed with shock in his pupils.

The Wind Edge Lord and the others were also shocked because this wasn’t possible. He now knew why Lin Yun could hold his ground facing Ji Lingfeng, Xiao Yuanqi, and the Autumn Mountain Lord. At times, he even looked as though he could see the future.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

The Wind Edge Lord recalled the scenes back at the Martial Dao Tea Party and woke up from his shock. When he looked at Lin Yun, his pupils were filled with shock, and his murderous aura became denser.

He had to kill Lin Yun no matter what, or it would be troublesome in the future. Grasping the Sword Heart was even more terrifying than grasping the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent. After all, Lin Yun could be called a Sword Saint after reaching the Saint Realm now that he had grasped the Sword Heart. But Lin Yun already grasped the Sword Heart at the Dragon Pulse Realm. So how heaven-defying was his talent in the sword path?

“So what if you’ve grasped the Sword Heart? You’re still a mere insect at the Dragon Pulse Realm!” Liu Hai’s pupils radiated with hostility. When he came to his senses, he summoned his constellation, and the pressure he gave off became even stronger. When he got close, his terrifying dragon origin swept out and emitted a powerful aura.

Liu Hai’s spear techniques became even more ferocious, causing the sea within ten-odd miles of radius to tremble. But Lin Yun easily faced it because there were more openings in Liu Hai’s spear techniques. Under the empowerment of the surrounding spiritual energy, Lin Yun’s sword aura became even more terrifying and easily blocked the aura given off by Liu Hai.

His Sword Heart was like a vortex within his body, attracting the surrounding spiritual energy and converting it into sword aura. Ten-odd moves later, a cold light suddenly flashed within Lin Yun’s pupils because he saw a huge opening.

As Lin Yun soared to the sky, he executed the Divine Sunchasing Art and was like a bright sun. Under the dazzling radiance, Liu Hai was forced to shut his eyes.

When Lin Yun turned around, his hundred thousand dragon runes manifested into a massive azure dragon before he landed on the Azure Dragon’s head.

At this moment, Lin Yun’s sword aura completely merged with the Azure Dragon, and Lin Yun divided into two, swinging his swords out. He executed the Azure Dragon Sword Art—Unrivaled•Thunderstorm Slash.

When the two sword rays intertwined, the surrounding space was split into four, and the spot where the sword rays intertwined was fixed onto Liu Hai. As Liu Hai’s Profound Life Stage aura began to crumble, Lin Yun loosened his sword before gently pushing his right hand forth.

The glory spirit within the Flower Burial Sword was activated. Before anyone had the time to react, a streak of light pierced through Liu Hai’s chest, creating a huge hole. When Liu Hai fell into the sea, he could no longer get up again.

“Come back!” Lin Yun pressed his right hand down and grabbed onto the Flower Burial Sword. Just like that, a second stage Profound Life Stage elder of the Liu Saint Clan died.

The Wind Edge Lord’s heart trembled, and he had not yet come to his senses. When Lin Yun descended once more, the azure dragon disintegrated into dragon runes while returning his body. As for the Flower Burial Sword, there was blood dripping down from it. This was the power of the sword.

The Wind Edge Lord stared at the Flower Burial Sword and could sense the sharp and murderous aura coming from it while emitting a terrifying power. This was a sign that the Flower Burial Sword was a Glory Saint Artifact far stronger than the Nethermoon Saint Armor. So it wasn’t an injustice for Liu Hai to be killed so quickly. When the Wind Edge Lord came to his senses, his pupils were blazing with flames.

“A Glory Saint Artifact. Hahaha! Lin Yun, you do not just bolt!” The Wind Edge Lord looked at the Flower Burial Sword with greed radiating within his pupils. After all, a Glory Saint Artifact was something that could even tempt saints.

The eyes of the three remaining elders behind the Wind Edge Lord also greedily looked at Lin Yun’s sword. They suddenly realized that Lin Yun was full of treasures.

“You want it? Sorry, but you’re not worthy.” Lin Yun replied.

The corner of the Wind Edge Lord’s lips curled up, and he smiled, “It’s fine. A dead person like you doesn’t have to care if I’m worthy or not. You still have other treasures on you, right? I’m looking forward to it now. Lin Xiao, you have given me a great surprise.”
