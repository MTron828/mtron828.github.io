Chapter 465 - Bitter Fight!

Lin Yun defeated Trueorigin with the Great Wind Sculpture and pointed his sword at Qin Yu. He defeated three people in Hell Mode and his achievements were practically a miracle. In the situation where no one was optimistic for him, Lin Yun defeated Situ Yi, Bai Lixuan, and then Trueorigin. What he had accomplished up to this point was legendary, but who knew what he went through to get to this point?

Without any magnificent talk or speech, he merely pointed his sword at Qin Yu. He had waited too long for this day and it was time to get justice for Xin Jue’s death, even if he had to crawl out of hell. He was telling everyone that he was after Qin Yu in the Great Qin Competition.

On the stage, Lin Yun’s eyes had never before blazed with such fighting spirit. He was suppressing the rage and insanity in his heart.

“Just what did he go through to have such a gaze?”

“Terrifying. I’ve never seen such fighting spirit in someone’s eyes before. He’s definitely not pushing himself. The championship was always his goal.”

“Perhaps it’s because of his promise. I heard that Lin Yun had promised Xin Jue that he would win.”

“If Xin Jue was here, I bet he would be happy to see how far Lin Yun has come.”

Everyone was infected by Lin Yun’s fighting spirit. At the same time, their belief that Hell Mode could not be conquered was also shaken. They couldn’t help wanting to show their support for Lin Yun. After all, Lin Yun had come so far and he was only one step away from creating a never before seen legend. But could Lin Yun really defeat Qin Yu?

Qin Yu revealed a sneer as he took a step forward. In the next second, he appeared on the stage. Looking at Lin Yun standing before him, his blood boiled with excitement. Not only could he become the champion after defeating Lin Yun, but he could also kill the one person he wanted to kill the most. Just imagining it filled Qin Yu with excitement.

“I never expected that you would come so far just to fight me. That palm must be what you got from the Demonlotus Realm, right? But can you use it again?” Qin Yu sneered as he looked at Lin Yun who was covered in wounds.

“You can give it a try,” said Lin Yun.

“You can’t make me bring out all my strength at your current state. Let’s talk after you take three palms from me,” sneered Qin Yu. He continued, “If you’re still alive after three palms, then you’ll have the qualification to fight me for real.”

Everyone could sense the arrogance in Qin Yu’s words. Even if Lin Yun had defeated three people, he was still nothing in Qin Yu’s eyes. But no one mocked Qin Yu for his arrogance because he was Qin Yu, he was Flying Feather. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

No one had seen how strong he was. They had only seen him lose to Drifting Goblet in one move, but that was three years ago. No one knew how strong he had become after three years.

“Hell Mode’s final match, Flower Burial VS Flying Feather!”

The moment the judge made the announcement, Qin Yu casually threw out a palm. Although this palm might seem simple, it emitted a terrifying aura that swept up a cloud of dust on the stage. Shortly after, a huge palm formed with origin energy appeared out of nowhere.

Once the palm appeared, everyone’s gazes changed. The aura coming from it was too terrifying and even the elites in the Martial Profound Realm trembled in fear. As for the Violet Palace Realm experts, they looked at the palm with grave expressions.

Lin Yun narrowed his eyes into slits at this scene and he drew the Flower Burial Sword without any hesitation, “Aquaselenic Sword—Luminous Moon!”

At the same time, the Iris Flower in his dantian blossomed. This added a purple tint to the moon as it clashed with the huge palm. Even the atmosphere was trembling under the clash and in the next second, the purple sword ray collapsed.

Lin Yun’s face changed slightly and he placed his sword before him to defend himself against the incoming palm. The moon was destroyed under the palm and Lin Yun was also pushed to the corner of the stage. Even his face was terrifyingly pale.

“Too weak. I’m barely using 30% of my power, but you can’t even take a hit?” Qin Yu looked at Lin Yun with a smile. At the same time, his words left everyone shocked. Qin Yu only used 30% of his strength to force Lin Yun into this state. Just how terrifying was Qin Yu?

Lin Yun wore a grave expression because Qin Yu was more terrifying than he had imagined. Although he didn’t use all of his power, the power of his sword was definitely not weak since it was empowered by the Iris Sword Sutra. Was this because Qin Yu had cultivated an earth grade cultivation technique?

“Let’s try again. This time, guess how much strength I’ve used?” Qin Yu was enjoying this feeling. He enjoyed slowly tormenting Lin Yun. At the same time, another huge palm was sent out from him, but this time, the power contained in the palm was more terrifying.

The terrifying heatwave instantly raised the surrounding temperature in the plaza. Under this palm, it felt as though everything had stopped. There was nothing else aside from the brutal heat coming from the palm.

Lin Yun wore a grave expression and the sword in his hand began to buzz as he faced the incoming heatwave. In the next second, the Flower Burial Sword emitted a dazzling radiance. This was a sword close to being a cosmic artifact and it was pushed to the limit by Lin Yun. This time, he was unleashing the Aquaselenic Sword—Myriad Frost.

The Aquaselenic Sword’s essence was in its coldness and in Lin Yun’s hands, it had reached the manifestation stage. So the power naturally exceeded everyone’s expectations. It was a sword that could freeze everything within a myriad miles.

A layer of frost swiftly covered the surface of the stage and even the atmosphere was frozen. Even the palm from Qin Yu was frozen.

Success? Everyone raised their brows. But before they had any joy on their faces, Lin Yun’s attack shattered once more and the blazing palm slammed into Lin Yun.

Once struck by the attack, Lin Yun threw up a mouthful of blood. He had suffered an unprecedented injury in this competition.

“Looks like you won’t be able to fight me for real,” said Qin Yu with an indifferent gaze. Looking at Lin Yun, he muttered to himself, “Then again, you’re only a sword slave. It’s too naive to think that you can turn the tables around. This time, I will return to you the humiliation I suffered in the wedding with 70% of my strength!”

The moment he finished, he appeared above Lin Yun, sending his third palm down. This palm was so condensed that it looked like a huge flaming mountain falling from the sky. The entire stage was trembling from its might and everyone could tell that this palm was more terrifying than the other two.

When everyone saw this attack, they felt chills down their spine. This attack was more than enough to kill ten quasi-Violet Palace realm cultivators.

Looking at the incoming attack, Lin Yun’s eyes flashed. Just 70% of his power is this terrifying? This means that the previous attack was barely even 50%. Am I going to lose now?

“How can our grudge be settled so easily!” Lin Yun’s eyes blazed with boundless killing aura. Basking in the killing aura, Lin Yun looked like a fiend from hell. As he circulated the Iris Sword Sutra, an Iris Flower slowly took form in the sky.

Aquaselenic Sword—Heavenly Cloud Shatter!

Lin Yun brought out his strongest attack now that the phenomenon from the Iris Sword Sutra reaching the ninth stage had appeared.

This sword was just used to defeat Bai Lixuan, so when it appeared once more, Qin Yu looked surprised. But soon, his face turned grim, “No wonder you can defeat the Thunderclap Crusher. This is truly terrifying, but it’s a pity that you ran into me. Our difference isn’t something that your sword technique can overcome. Die!”

When the palm crashed down, it was like a comet falling to the ground, creating a huge crater. The stage was wrecked as if it had just been through a natural disaster.

Lin Yun’s face changed as the Iris Flower behind him shattered before disappearing.

“I told you that I was going to repay you for the humiliation I suffered!” Qin Yu’s eyes flashed coldly and his palm suppressed Lin Yun ruthlessly.

The entire stage trembled violently and Lin Yun was buried beneath the stage. The status of his life was unknown.
