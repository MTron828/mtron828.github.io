Chapter 1714 – Silver Starry Sky and Nine Heavenly Phoenix Dance

When Yun Xi saw Xiahou Feng and Xin Wuhen, her eyes shone so brightly that it was as though she wanted to immediately pounce at them.

“Who are they?” Lin Yun asked.

“Xiahou Feng is proficient in the flute, Xin Wuhen is proficient in the short flute, and our senior brother is proficient in the zither. The three have grasped the Saint Tone and are all Grand Musicians.” Yun Xi smiled with her face blushing.

Lin Yun wasn’t surprised by that. Just because he could grasp the Saint Tone under the guidance of Lil’ Purple, that didn’t mean others couldn’t. After all, he didn’t spend much time cultivating the music dao when compared to those devoted from a young age. In the eyes of others, he should be someone who’s considered a monster to grasp the Saint Tone after picking it up midway.

“The two of you came together?” The Wind Edge Lord smiled.

“I came when we bumped into each other.” Xiahou Feng smiled, holding onto his flute, and he gave off a faint elegance that made him look like a celestial that would be carried by the wind any moment now.

On the other hand, Xin Wuhen wasn’t at all inferior when compared to him. They both grasped the Saint Tone, and the aura that they were emitting was clearly stronger than other musicians.

The banquet soon began when all the guests arrived, and everyone laughed and chatted. The topic slowly shifted to the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion and the Exquisite Court’s recent challenge.

“I heard someone arrogant recently appeared in the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion, and Brother Xu suffered in his hands?” Someone’s gaze fell onto Xu Dongfei.

Xu Dongfei was placed in an awkward position to be asked publicly. Beside him, Lan Hongyan’s face was cold, and she nearly lost her composure when she heard Lin Xiao being mentioned.

“Brother Xu can just speak. There are no outsiders here.” The Wind Edge Lord said with an amicable smile.

“That’s true. Lin Xiao’s achievement in music dao is shocking. His music contains ancient rhythm, and he also has a mysterious finger technique. Most importantly, this person has fused his martial dao and music dao. But his character is poor. He is vicious and even humiliated my junior sister using music dao.” Xu Dongfei smiled.

“He’s just a dog nurtured by the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion!” Lan Hongyan said coldly. She looked unsightly, which made everyone’s faces change as they turned to look at Jiang Yu. After all, Jiang Yu was an elder from the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion.

But Jiang Yu merely took a sip of his wine and smiled, “That person is indeed a dog. Not only is he a dog, but he’s a rabid dog. He likes to claim to be barbarian, and he crippled my son’s dragon pulses and ten fingers when they had an argument!”

Everyone took a cold breath when they heard that. This Lin Xiao was really ruthless.

“That’s not all. He even teased Saint Elder on his first day in the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion.” Jiang Yu added coldly.

“Looks like this person is also a lustful dog.” The Wind Edge Lord smiled.

“Hahaha!” Everyone else laughed along, and the atmosphere became joyful.

Far away, Yun Xi exclaimed when she heard their conversation, “Is Lin Xiao really that bad?”

She didn’t have much of a good impression of Lin Yun, but she couldn’t help feeling weird when he heard everyone discussing Lin Xiao behind his back, including the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s elder. But if his character was that bad, why did the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion still want to accept him? ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Play your zither, and don’t let the dancers mess up the tempo.” Lin Yun smiled.

On the stage, Huang Xuanyi took a sip of wine and commented, “Looks like the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion has declined to accept someone so unruly. They don’t deserve a position as one of the Four Musical Houses at all.”

“That’s right. To accept someone as despicable as Lin Xiao, the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion should have been kicked out long ago.”

“They don’t deserve their position, to begin with. Not to mention they accepted someone like Lin Xiao.” The other guests agreed.

The Wind Edge Lord smiled, “All of you need not to be so emotional. The Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion determines the Four Musical Houses; we do not determine them. But we should get rid of this Lin Xiao because he’s too much.”

His words were beautiful because he only targeted Lin Xiao, not the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion. But if the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion handed Lin Xiao over, they would take a massive blow to their prestige. The matter would blow up if they didn’t hand Lin Xiao over.

Lan Hongyan’s blood began to boil as she recalled what had happened. She said, “Wind Edge Lord, you have to help me. That Lin Xiao bullied a woman like me with his martial dao just because he has the entire Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion backing him!”

Xu Dongfei rolled his eyes and instantly understood what the Wind Edge Lord was trying to do. He needed an excuse to deal with the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion. Since Lin Xiao was determined as a scumbag by everyone not long ago, this naturally became a great excuse for them to make a move against the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion. Even he hadn’t forgotten his loss to Lin Xiao back then.

“I ask the Wind Edge Lord to uphold justice for my junior sister. That Lin Xiao is despicable, and someone like him shouldn’t exist within the Heavenly Domain City. His existence alone brings down our city's reputation!” Xu Dongfei said as he went down on one knee.

“Please, get up. I can’t accept you guys kneeling to me.” The Wind Edge Lord said.

Huang Xuanyi toyed with the wine cup in his hand and sneered, “Get up. A mad dog like him doesn’t need the Wind Edge Lord to personally deal with him. You guys think too highly of him. Didn’t you guys say that he likes to call himself a barbarian? Let me deal with him, then. I happen to have a hobby of beating up dogs!”

The Wind Edge Lord swept his gaze over before stopping on Xiaohou Feng, Xin Wuhen, and Kong Ying. He held those three with the highest regard amongst all the musicians present because they were grand musicians.

“If he’s willing to compete in the zither, I’m willing to play with him.” Kong Ying said.

“Haha, the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion has fallen. They have a Profound Fairy that doesn’t show herself, and they even accepted a Lin Xiao. There’s no way they can convince everyone with that.” Xin Wuhen said while drinking his wine.

In the end, the Wind Edge Lord’s gaze moved to Xiahou Feng. Seeing this, Xiahou Feng smiled, “I’m not interested in him, and it’s enough with Brother Kong around. I’m more interested in their Profound Fairy.”

Wearing a smile, the Wind Edge Lord said, “Then let us pay the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion a visit tomorrow morning.”

“Thank you, Wind Edge Lord!” Lan Hongyan and Xu Dongfei quickly got up with the excitement on their faces. This was because they knew that they could finally take their revenge now.

“I don’t hold much hope in that. Saint Elder places great importance on Lin Xiao, and it won’t be that simple for you to take him.” Jiang Yu said.

“I heard this Saint Elder came recently, right? In terms of seniority, there’s no way she can be compared to Uncle Jiang. We’re only targeting Lin Xiao tomorrow, so I’ll need Uncle Jiang to discuss this matter with the other seniors of the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion.” The Wind Edge Lord smiled.

“That shouldn’t be an issue.” Jiang Yu smiled.

“Ladies and gentlemen, what do you guys think?” The Wind Edge Lord smiled.

“It’s naturally part of our responsibility to rid the city of scum!”

“That’s right. Someone like Lin Xiao should be taught a lesson, so let me see if the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion will hand him over tomorrow.”

“If the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion isn’t willing, they should be removed from being one of the Four Musical Houses.” The Wind Edge Lord invited everyone, and they naturally knew what he was planning. So everyone agreed with the Wind Edge Lord, which also brought the atmosphere in the banquet to a new height.

As the Wind Edge Lord emitted an aura at the ninth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, he said, “We’ll go with that plan, then. We have to make the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion hand over Lin Xiao, regardless if they want to or not!”

His voice had suppressed all the noise in the banquet, causing a brief silence. But right then, beautiful zither music resounded, instantly captivating all the dancers. Their dance also became charming, and they were fully immersed in it as their dance gradually became faster along with the music.

They even wore bizarre expressions, as though they had sold their souls to the devil, and this scene made everyone feel their scalps tingle. They were like phoenixes dancing on stars.

“Who’s playing the zither?!” The Wind Edge Lord roared. Not only Huang Xuanyi but all the musicians present could sense that something wasn’t right, and someone was clearly controlling the dancers. If it weren’t for the Wind Edge Lord’s words that caused a brief silence, they wouldn’t have been able to notice it.

This realization instantly made everyone feel a chill run down their spines, and they quickly turned to look at where the music came from.

“Silver Starry Sky and Nine Heavenly Phoenix Dance! Who the hell are you?!” The Wind Edge Lord’s gaze became sharp, and he used his cultivation to interrupt the music. When the music stopped, all the dancers fainted on the ground.

When Lin Yun raised his head, he smiled, “You guys have been back talking about me for an entire night, but you don’t even know who I am? There’s no need to wait for tomorrow. The Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s Lin Xiao is here!”
