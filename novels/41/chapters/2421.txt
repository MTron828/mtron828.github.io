Chapter 2422 - Sword Saint

On a mountain in the Azure Sky Realm, Lin Yun sat with his eyes closed while circulating the two sword canons. A Heavenly Dragon and a Divine Phoenix were coiling around him, devouring the surrounding saint energy

This was where the Azure Sky God Lord went for his seclusion, so the density of saint energy here was high, forming into ribbons as they poured into Lin Yun’s chest.

Seven swords also appeared behind Lin Yun, representing the seven peaks in the Great Profound Sword Canon. When the saint energy poured into his body, a portion converted into his cultivation, and a portion nourished his Bright Sun Sword Intent.

Within Lin Yun’s mind, there was a golden fireball within his sword sea. If that light shot out, it could pierce through any ninth-stage Saint Lord, and even a Quasi-Saint Sovereign wouldn’t be able to withstand it. This was the power of eighth-grade sword intent.

Lin Yun’s heart began to beat while feeling uneasy that he couldn’t circulate his two sword canons any further. This feeling was as terrifying as having dropped into a lake. He took a deep breath to recall the two sword canons and the Heavenly Dragon and Divine Phoenix returned to his violet palace.

His violet palace had been significantly transformed now, looking like a small world instead. When the seven swords entered his body, Lin Yun was doubtful as he opened his eyes. He muttered to himself, “What’s going on? This has never happened before...”

He had never faced this situation before, and it was a bad premonition that made him feel uneasy. His saint energy began to fluctuate just when it had calmed down, and the cauldron within his violet palace also trembled violently.

When space began to distort, the Iris Sword Saint appeared before Lin Yun and patted his hand on Lin Yun’s forehead. When a warm energy coursed through his body, Lin Yun gradually calmed down.

“Thank you, Senior,” Lin Yun heaved in relief.

The Iris Sword Saint gave Lin Yun a weird look, “Aren’t you trying to reach the Saint Sovereign? Why did you run amok all of a sudden?”

With Lin Yun’s foundation, it’s still impossible for him to become a Saint Sovereign, and he could be in danger if he forced himself. Lin Yun naturally knew that, and he couldn’t try to make a breakthrough now. He said, “I was cultivating normally, but I had a bad premonition that made my heart clench, and the two sword canons went out of control. This is weird...”

“Karma has arrived,” the Iris Sword Saint said.

Karma? What karma? It didn’t take long before Lin Yun figured it out. He asked, “You’re saying my master’s tribulation has started?”

“Highly possible, and he might even be in danger. Either that or the Kunlun Realm is in danger. Either way, they’re not good signs,” the Iris Sword Saint nodded. “If there’s someone proficient in Karma Dao, they can show it to you. But I can’t determine what karma it is.”

“Senior, please send me back,” Lin Yun said.

“You’re not going to cultivate the Nirvana Dao?” The Iris Sword Saint asked.

“There’s not much time left. If my master is undergoing his tribulation now, I must return,” Lin Yun said.

The Iris Sword Saint briefly looked at Lin Yun, before he said, “The Saint Sovereign has three stages: the Saint Domain, Heavenly Domain, and Dao Domain Stages. By becoming a Saint Sovereign, your saint origin can turn into a small world, producing an endless supply of saint energy within your body so that even heaven and earth can’t destroy your foundation. That’s the meaning of the Saint Domain.

“Once formed, it can devour and contain more saint daos. At the same time, your saint origin and saint physique will also transform. If you reach complete mastery, the small world will turn into a big world, and it’s hard for Saint Lords to injure you at that time. The saint energy is endless, and you can leave whenever you want, even if you face a tough opponent.”

As the Iris Sword Saint explained, Lin Yun’s anxiety gradually calmed down. The Iris Sword Saint continued, “With your cultivation as a Quasi-Saint Sovereign, two Eternal Daos, two Sovereign Constellations, and sword intent, ordinary Saint Sovereigns can’t defeat you; you might even kill them if they’re careless. But if you face a pinnacle Saint Domain Saint Sovereign, they’re ruthless before you, not to mention Heavenly Domain and Dao Domain Saint Sovereigns...”

“Senior, please don’t speak any further,” Lin Yun said.

“I have to carry on, or I can’t calm you down,” the Iris Sword Saint said. “I might’ve left the Kunlun Realm for a long time, but those who are capable of interfering with your master’s tribulation are at least Great Saints since even pinnacle Saint Sovereigns can’t get close because even just the shockwave alone is enough to kill them.”

Lin Yun didn’t refute that since he knew that what the Iris Sword Saint said was true. He sighed, “I understand, and I also thought that way coming to the Heavenly Barren Realm. Even if I die outside, it’s worth it as long as I can get the Divine Phoenix Holy Master to help.”

He bitterly smiled, “But I couldn’t control my emotions earlier, and it must’ve been a joke to you.”

“I won’t laugh at you as I have experienced it before. Even if we know the reasons, we still can’t help feeling helpless,” the Iris Sword Saint said.

Lin Yun was surprised since he didn’t expect that from the Iris Sword Saint. It was true that he felt helpless, knowing that he couldn’t do anything to help.

“I have experienced the same as you regardless of whether my master went to suppress the Nether Realm alone or that battle back then,” the Iris Sword Saint continued. “But your situation is better because it’s not hopeless.” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Senior, can you allow me to confront Great Saints in three days?” Lin Yun asked.

“I can only guide you in three days so that you can reach the Emperor Realm more easily. I can’t allow you to confront Great Saints in three days,” the Iris Sword Saint shook his head. “Only demonic cultivators can do that with the Blood Sacrifice Ceremony, but they’re exhausting their potential to accomplish it.”

Lin Yun couldn’t help feeling disappointed, so he smiled, “Senior, is there really no other way?”

Seeing that Lin Yun had calmed down, the Iris Sword Saint smiled, “You’re smart. It’s unrealistic to allow you to confront Great Saints, but you can use external help. This has to be stronger than Sovereign Saint Artifacts, which is something that you have.”

“The Firmament Saint Cloth?” Lin Yun asked.

“That’s right,” the Iris Sword Saint replied.

Lin Yun scratched his head and smiled, “I used it once to kill a Great Saint. But after Tian Xuanzi came to his senses, he could withstand the power of it. As for the price, I would probably be dead if I used it again.”

The Iris Sword Saint smiled, “When you used it previously, it exhausted your life force. But it’s not that terrifying if you can shift the price elsewhere.”

“Senior, can you go deeper into that?” Lin Yun’s interest was piqued.

“Let the Firmament Saint Cloth bear the price. It can be fixed if damaged, but you’re gone if you’re dead,” the Iris Sword Saint said.

Lin Yun instantly understood what the Iris Sword Saint meant, which was to let the Firmament Saint Cloth bear the price. But if he used it, the Firmament Saint Cloth might be destroyed. Let’s not mention if the Iris Sword Saint could do that, but Lin Yun felt heartache losing a treasure like that. Then again, it was acceptable in comparison to his master’s tribulation. He could only apologize to the Azure Dragon Lord.

The Iris Sword Saint said, “The Azure Dragon Lord gave you the Firmament Saint Cloth, hoping you can reforge the Heavenly Path. He didn’t expect you to grasp Nirvana Dao. With my guidance, you can rely on it to reforge the Heavenly Path. Furthermore, don’t you have another item comparable to the Firmament Saint Cloth?”

“The Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella? Buddhist Emperor Golden Lotus Spear? Black Tortoise Chains? They’re not exactly supreme treasures...” Lin Yun was baffled.

“Think carefully again,” the Iris Sword Saint said.

Lin Yun’s face changed since he couldn’t recall a treasure comparable to the Firmament Saint Cloth. When baffled, he saw the Iris Sword Saint’s face becoming cold. “Senior...”

Suddenly, an item appeared in his mind, and he asked uncertainty, “The Iris Sword Box?”

“That’s right. The Iris Sword Box is stronger than the Firmament Saint Cloth. So you don’t have to overthink about the possibility of the Firmament Saint Cloth being destroyed,” the Iris Sword Saint smiled. “You can use the Firmament Saint Cloth for your master’s tribulation and the Iris Sword Box and Nirvana Dao to reforge the Heavenly Path. Isn’t that perfect?”

Lin Yun pondered and found sense in the Iris Sword Saint’s words. But thinking about it again, something felt weird somewhere. Why couldn’t he destroy the Iris Sword Box for his master’s tribulation and use the Firmament Saint Cloth to reforge the Heavenly Path? The Iris Sword Saint hinted at him for so long, seemingly wanting him to destroy the Firmament Saint Cloth.

Just thinking about it shocked Lin Yun, and he wondered if there was a feud between them.

Sensing Lin Yun’s thoughts, the Iris Sword Saint smiled, “I have no personal feud with the Azure Dragon Lord. But when I left the Kunlun Realm back then, he grumbled at me. Furthermore, he wouldn’t care about the Firmament Saint Cloth as long as you can reforge the Heavenly Path.”

Lin Yun bitterly smiled and no longer dared to say anything else. He finally knew why Lil’ Purple was so petty. It turned out that she was the same as the Iris Sword Saint, and these two must’ve done many bad things back then.
