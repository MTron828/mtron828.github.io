Chapter 1401 - Blank Scroll

The Sword Sect’s gate was in a mess, with the heirs of six saint clans kneeling with their heads on the ground. This humiliation was unprecedented, at least not in Sword Sect’s history. It was extremely rare for someone to humiliate them this much, even in the Ancient Barren Domain.

The shock that Lin Yun had brought to everyone was too great; defeating the successors of seven Saint Clans all by himself. At this moment, everyone was already comparing him with Xiahou Yan, who was able to pull out the Sky Annihilation Saint Sword.

“He’s simply too strong. Is this the power of the firmament sword intent? I’m simply speechless…”

“The seven of them are on the Elysium Core Ranking, right? How far can he go? He’s only at the Lesser Elysium Core Realm, so does that mean he can even become first on the Elysium Core Ranking when he reaches the Heavenly Elysium Core Realm one day?”

“I already feel that he’s comparable to Xiahou Yan now. If he draws that sword out, he might even be able to surpass Xiahou Yan.”

“Let’s not talk about that… you’ll be in trouble if you accidentally offend the Xiahou’s.”

Typically speaking, it should be hard for someone to climb the stairs. Lin Yun’s performance made him seem unrivaled, aside from Xiahou Yan. But what surprised everyone was that Lin Yun gave up on pulling the Sky Annihilation Saint Sword after looking at it for a few seconds.

His eyes briefly flickered before he went down the stairs. Lin Yun didn’t want to be in the limelight because this wasn’t the Hidden Sword Pavilion. If he pulled the sword out and the sword snapped, everyone would suspect him, and he would lose more than his gains if his secrets were exposed. Not to mention that he was already in the spotlight now.

After today, the name Flower Burial Lin Yun would surely spread throughout Eastern Desolation or even the Kunlun Realm. Who in the world would dare to face the heirs of the seven Saint Clans by himself, and how many people could accomplish what Lin Yun did? With the Carefree 9 Swords, he was simply unbeatable amongst those of the same generation.

Many women had splendors in their eyes when they looked at Lin Yun, and they discovered that he was pretty handsome, especially the purple mark that made him look devilish. Lin Yun’s charm was like an abyss sucking them in.

When Lin Yun passed Ye Ziling and the others, he nodded with a wink, “I’ll wait for you guys down below.”

Without the interference of the Saint Clans, it shouldn’t be an issue for them to get through the first stage.

“Haha! Lin Yun, you really have a good temper!” Gongsun Yan laughed.

“That’s for sure. My temper has always been good.” Lin Yun smiled as he rubbed his chin. But when others heard that, their lips twitched. Thinking about what happened to the seven princes, they would be fools to believe Lin Yun had a good temper.

When Lin Yun came down the stairs, he came to where Old Liu was and stood beside him. Old Liu’s face was plastered with smiles, and Lin Yun’s performance today had even outshone Xiahou Yan. Then again, some would disagree because Lin Yun didn’t choose to pull out the Sky Annihilation Saint Sword while Xiahou Yan accomplished it.

“Lin Yun, why didn’t you pull out the Sky Annihilation Saint Sword?” Old Liu asked. Even if Lin Yun wouldn’t succeed, he should at least give it a try.

“Is there a need for that?” Lin Yun replied. “I just have the climb the stairs to get through the first stage, right?”

“You’re really foolish!” Old Liu was speechless. “Didn’t you see that the six saints are here? They should be examining everyone to pick their disciples. Do you know how precious time is for saints? They’re rarely even willing to take in a disciple. You should give it a try. I can tell those saints are curious about you, and you might become a saint disciple if you catch their attention.”

“There’s no need for that,” replied Lin Yun. He believed it was enough to be a saint disciple with his performance. Furthermore, there was a vast difference between becoming the disciple of those saints and the disciple of the Radiant Sword Saint.

His obsession with the Radiant Sword Saint was too strong. After all, the Radiant Sword Saint sent Feng Jue to save him in the Heavenly Path from Jin Jue, which was why he wanted to prove himself to the Radiant Sword Saint. But he had it all wrong, looking at it now. The six saints were already there, but the Radiant Sword Saint was nowhere to be seen. So this couldn’t help making Lin Yun feel disappointed.

“You’re really a fool.” Old Liu weakly smiled. He had no idea what to say about Lin Yun.

Lin Yun didn’t try, but everyone else who climbed the stairs tried to pull out the sword, and none succeeded. Then again, most people couldn’t even climb the stairs, and even if they did, it wasn’t easy getting close to that sword. Only four people managed to get close to the sword: Ye Ziling and Zhao Yan. They were both interested in pulling out the sword and naturally failed.

The other two were Xiahou Yan’s younger brother, Xiahou Yun, and Bai Saint Clan’s prince, Bai Zhanli. As the Nether Divinity Clan was tied to the Profound Sky Sect, they naturally wouldn’t be coming to partake in the test. So amongst the nine remaining Saint Clans, only the Xiahou Saint Clan and Bai Saint Clan didn’t stand out to target Lin Yun.

Xiahou Yun and Bai Zhanli’s performances were outstanding enough. When they tried to pull out the sword, their sword aura was comparable to Lin Yun in that split moment, but they still failed to draw the sword.

With that, the controversy over whether Lin Yun or Xiahou Yan was stronger was settled. In most people’s view, Lin Yun chose not to draw the sword because he knew he would fail. Since that was the case, the one who could draw the sword was naturally stronger in their eyes.

Then again, some feel that Lin Yun was disdainful of pulling the sword, and he could draw it out if he wanted. The controversy gradually grew stronger, and it was something that Lin Yun hadn’t expected. This was also because his battle with the seven various saint clans’ princes had left many people in admiration.

After everyone was done, Ye Ziling, Zhao Yan, Feng Zhang, Liu Qingyan, and Gongsun Yan gathered beside Old Liu, which instantly drew much attention. After all, they had now become famous after the previous fight and won respect with their strength.

“It’s too hard just to get close to the sword, and it nearly took everything out of me.” Gongsun Yan looked at Lin Yun before he sighed, “I finally understand why you didn’t choose to draw the sword.”

“Indeed, when I held onto the sword, it felt as if the sword was in an abyss. I have no idea how Xiahou Yan managed to pull it out.” Ye Ziling nodded in agreement.

Zhao Yan, who also tried to pull the sword, had a dull expression. He was thinking about what the Sky Annihilation Saint Sword represented. But no matter what, everyone was in a good mood because they made it through the first stage with smiles plastered on their faces.

This time, the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect had become famous. Not only did everyone make it through the first stage, but they even made most geniuses from the Jiang Saint Clan fail. Gongsun Yan and Feng Zhang were especially excited and still hadn’t calmed down.

But Lin Yun said nothing about it. They still had some distance to be compared to those top-tiered geniuses from the saint clans, but they were still young. So who knew who would be stronger in the future?

“Let’s go to the second stage. I still have no idea what the second stage is,” Old Liu smiled as he brought everyone into the Sword Sect. They soon arrived at the second stage of the test, and many people were gathered there. They were all geniuses who made it through the first stage. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“The Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect is here! Lin Yun is also amongst them!”

“Wow, Lin Yun is really handsome!” A woman exclaimed when she looked at Lin Yun. But no one said anything about it because it was a fact, especially when he looked like an immortal when he executed the Carefree 9 Swords. Even men couldn’t help being captivated by that sort of temperament around Lin Yun.

“Weird. Why isn’t Xiahou Yan here?”

“Yeah, there’s Xiahou Yan? The two didn’t meet in the first stage, and I’m waiting for them to fight.”

“He’s gone. I heard he’s exempted from the second stage since he drew the sword, and he’s now waiting at the third stage.”

“What? Really? Holy crap!” Everyone was stumped when they heard that Xiahou Yan was exempted from the second stage of the test. Then again, this was also because Xiahou Yan’s performance was too breathtaking.

Xiahou Yun and Bai Zhanli were standing together amongst the crowd. They weren’t too bothered by everyone’s praises for Lin Yun, especially Xiahou Yun, “Brother Bai, you heard that? Are these people comparing Lin Yun to my big brother? My big brother has been famous in the Ancient Barren Domain for a long time, and he’s acknowledged as the strongest swordsman amongst the younger generation. So who does Lin Yun think he is?”

“He’s not a pushover. He defeated the seven princes, which can be considered a breathtaking accomplishment,” smiled Bai Zhanli.

But Xiahou Yun’s eyes flashed with disdain and replied, “They can’t summon their constellations, and no one can resist his firmament sword intent. So he can naturally do what he wants. If they’re going to fight with their lives on the line, Lin Yun will be the one kneeling!”

While everyone was discussing amongst themselves, a painting appeared above everyone and unraveled. When the scroll unraveled, a grey-clothed elder appeared, and his voice resounded, “The second stage is a test on everyone’s comprehension. This scroll has a sword technique hidden within, and every single form contains an intent. Those who want to get through this stage must grasp at least three forms!”

His words made everyone lock their brows while Xiahou Yun’s eyes lit up. If they had to fight, Xiahou Yun wasn’t Lin Yun’s opponent since he couldn’t summon his constellation. But it would be different if it was a competition between their comprehensions.

He had a strong comprehension and was confident of beating anyone except his big brother, Xiahou Yan; not to mention that he could even get help from Bai Zhanli. The corner of his lip rose, and he said, “Brother Bai, let him watch us, the saint clan’s geniuses, on this stage!”
