Chapter 2277 - I Believe Him

Wang Muyan was surprised, but she smiled, “Flower Burial, don’t hold back.”

She multitasked, suppressing the Divine Phoenix Mountain group with the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda while fighting Lin Yun. This was how confident she was with herself.

They were both using the Dragon Sun-Moon Seal, but the profundities they executed were different. Lin Yun used the Azure Dragon as his base to unleash the power of the divine dragon while using his two sword canons as the sun and moon. The divine dragon came before the sun and moon as he unleashed the full power of the two sword canons.

As the sun and moon revolved, the Heavenly Dragon, Divine Phoenix, Azure Firmament Sword, Indigo Firmament Sword, and Divine Firmament Sword manifested different phenomena, each one immediately riddling the crimson sky with holes.

It was different for Wang Muyan. The sun and moon came first before the divine dragon. As two crimson moons bloomed in her eyes, her heart violently beat like a bright sun within her body. There were two dragons coiling around her hands that looked like two divine dragons that were combining together when she clasped her hands. Her heart was the sun, her eyes were the moon, and her hands were the divine dragon.

When a boundless radiance shone, this made Wang Muyan look like a deity. Aside from that, the time and space seals around her made her figure look blurred.

Lin Yun’s gaze fell onto Wang Muyan’s sleeves. He was wondering how she was able to subdue the divine flame fragment. After all, even the Astral River Saint Lord had to divide his attention while suppressing the divine flame fragment.

He speculated that Wang Muyan must have some sort of treasure that could contain the divine flame fragment. As a result, she could just keep the divine flame fragment contained and didn’t have to suppress it.

“Dragon Sun-Moon Seal!”

“Dragon Sun-Moon Seal!” After they both formed their seals, they pushed their hands out and the two seals collided with powerful energy fluctuations sweeping out.

When everything settled down, Lin Yun took three steps back and raised his head to look over with surprise. On the other hand, Wang Muyan merely hovered in the air.

“You retreated?” Wang Muyan smiled as her ten fingers began to form the Dragon Sun-Moon Seal once more.

“Revolving Sun and Moon!” As Wang Muyan began forming seals, the sky alternated between light and dark. She looked confident as she executed the seal, giving everyone the feeling that everything was in her grasp.

“Blood Dying Sky!” Lin Yun’s long hair fluttered with a night screen descending from the sky, enveloping Wang Muyan.

“This move again?” Lin Yun and Wang Muyan had interacted within the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda for months, and they didn’t keep their comprehension of the Dragon Sun-Moon Seal from each other. So she was familiar with this move and had long come up with a solution to deal with it.

“Sun and Moon Unite!” Sunlight and moonlight bloomed as a crimson moon and a sun flew out from her. As the sun and moon began to fuse, they formed a powerful aura that made her look like a deity, tearing the darkness apart.

After she was done, she smiled, but her smile soon froze on her face. She resolved the profundity in Lin Yun’s Dragon Sun-Moon Seal, but Lin Yun appeared before her when the darkness disappeared and grabbed her wrist.

“Let go!” Wang Muyan’s eyes flashed with fury, and attacked Lin Yun with her left hand.

But Lin Yun merely smiled since he had no intention of holding onto her wrist and dodged her attack. He then reached out and tore Wang Muyan’s sleeves apart, which revealed Wang Muyan’s entire arm up to her shoulder.

“It’s not here?” Lin Yun was surprised because there wasn’t any treasure that he had speculated.

While he was momentarily distracted, Wang Muyan’s palm landed on Lin Yun’s chest, sending him flying away.

Blood dripped down from Lin Yun’s lips as he fell with one knee on the ground and his face pale.

After raising his head again, he had a clear gauge of Wang Muyan’s cultivation. It was at the second-stage Saint Lord. But the price for probing Wang Muyan’s strength was great, which was taking a palm head-on from Wang Muyan. He didn’t even suffer such heavy injuries in his fight with the Ying River King.

“Flower Burial, you’re really bold!” Wang Muyan raised her brow and looked at Lin Yun. She continued, “Since you want to see, I’ll let you see till you’re satisfied.”

The Blood Moon Divine Maiden removed her belt and threw her coat away. She wore thin clothes that outlined her perfect figure, looking charming.

This made Lin Yun look awkward, and knew that Wang Muyan had guessed his intentions. She was just humiliating him on purpose. He began to miss Lil’ Purple now because she definitely knew where the divine flame fragment would be if she was around.

“If you obediently come with me to the Blood Moon Sect, my sect master will treat you well,” Wang Muyan smiled as she dashed forth once more.

While Lin Yun fought with Wang Muyan, he observed her up and down, trying to determine if she had any inter-spatial treasures.

Logically speaking, it was impossible for something like the divine flame fragment to be kept in an inter-spatial treasure. Otherwise, the Astral River Saint Lord would’ve already done so. But what if Wang Muyan kept the divine flame fragment in a secret treasure before placing the secret treasure in the inter-spatial treasure?

Lin Yun soon shook his head because that was highly impossible due to the power the divine flame fragment contained. If the divine flame fragment broke free of the special treasure, the energy that it contained would blow apart the inter-spatial treasure, forming a space vortex that would devour Wang Muyan.

Hence, the divine flame fragment couldn’t be placed in an inter-spatial treasure since it couldn’t suppress its energy with only the space law of an inter-spatial treasure. Hence, the special treasure containing the divine flame fragment must still be on Wang Muyan, and she had to pour her saint energy into it to suppress it.

“You dare to be distracted during our fight?”

Lin Yun showed a flaw since he was multitasking. A roar echoed beside him as Wang Muyan pushed her palm at him.

Lin Yun moved, turned around and looked at Wang Muyan’s chest.

“You lecher…” Li Feibai couldn’t hold herself back anymore because Lin Yun’s eyes never stopped wandering over Wang Muyan’s body. He took it to the next level by staring at Wang Muyan’s chest.

Lin Yun finally figured it out and smiled after retracting his gaze. When Wang Muyan charged again, he looked relaxed despite taking three palms head-on. When they clashed their palms together, Lin Yun performed a somersault in mid-air and landed in the ruins. After his hand came in contact with the ground, he soared to the sky with a gentle push, executing the Azure Dragon’s Grasp, absorbing all of the Flame Dragon’s blood into his palm.

“It’s really still around.” Lin Yun looked at the Azure Dragon’s Seal on his palm that absorbed the dragon heart’s blood. With a gentle wave, he landed on the Flame Dragon’s skull to avoid Wang Muyan’s palm.

Everything happened in the blink of an eye, but Wang Muyan had no idea what Lin Yun did. While they clashed on the Flame Dragon’s skeleton, the three Saint Lords, who were heavily injured by Wang Muyan, watched as their faces darkened.

They wanted to join hands to restrain Wang Muyan and snatch the divine flame fragment and Heavenly Wheel Pagoda away. But even after bringing out three Sovereign Saint Artifacts, they still couldn’t confront Wang Muyan and were heavily injured by the time-space domain.

“Let’s go. We can’t stay here any longer.” The Heavenly Sage Saint Lord’s heart sank as he watched Lin Yun and Wang Muyan fight. Even while Wang Muyan was multitasking, she could still suppress Lin Yun, shocking the three Saint Lords.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Flower Burial wasn’t weak. The fact that Wang Muyan could make him throw out a mouthful of blood even without using the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda was unimaginable.

“Her strength is deep and unfathomable. She cannot be underestimated, so we have to leave,” the Crow Shot Saint Lord said with a dark expression.

The Indigo Brave Saint Lord glanced at the Flame Dragon Valley’s situation with his face becoming grave. The Flame Dragon Valley was in chaos, with demonic corpses clashing with Saints from the Eastern Desolation.

The Ying River King and Zhao Tianyu joined hands as they forced all the escaping cultivators back.

On the other hand, Wang Muyan had suppressed the Divine Phoenix Mountain group, which could barely hold on with the Divine Phoenix Mirror. No one knew about the Astral River Saint Lord’s condition.

If the three holy lands left, anyone could imagine what the outcome for everyone in the Flame Dragon Valley would be.

“I’m afraid that the Demonspirit Clan wants to refine demonic corpses using living people,” the Indigo Brave Saint Lord said with an ugly expression. Demonic corpses refined by using living people were much stronger than those refined using the dead. Back in the Dark Era, this was how the Demonspirit Clan suppressed cultivators from the Kunlun Realm.

Back then, Kunlun Realm’s cultivators were reduced to livestock and slaughtered after they grew up.

“So what? We might die here if we don’t leave. At that time, we won’t be able to protect the Sovereign Saint Artifacts,” the Heavenly Sage Saint Lord said coldly.

Hearing that, the Indigo Brave Saint Lord could only helplessly nod.

“Let’s split up. They won’t be able to stop us,” the Crow Shot Saint Lord added.

“Okay.” The three Saint Lords immediately put their decision into action and they led their elites to charge in different directions, trying to break free from the encirclement.

“Heavenly Sage Saint Lord, bring us along!”

“The three holy lands are just going to take care of themselves and leave us here to die?”

“We will be dead without the Sovereign Saint Artifact!”

Their actions caused panic to spark amongst the other Saint Lords. But the three Saint Lords were heavily injured and couldn’t even bring out 20% of the Sovereign Saint Artifacts' power. Their safety couldn’t be ensured, so why would they help others?

They could only try to sneak away while Wang Muyan was held down by Lin Yun, and the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda was held down by the Divine Phoenix Mirror.

“Let them leave,” the Ying River King said just when Zhao Tianyu was hesitating over whether he should let those people leave.

The Ying River King smiled, “It will be troublesome for us if those people are pushed into a dead-end. It’s already enough for us to take down the Divine Phoenix Mirror.”

The Ying River King knew the Divine Phoenix Mirror’s value, which was higher than the other three Sovereign Saint Artifacts.

In front of them, those from the Divine Dao Pavilion had formed an array with Qu Wushuang at the center, playing the zither to empower the entire array. But it was almost time for the Blood Moon Sect and Demonspirit Clan to destroy it.

“Young Master can’t hold on for long. We’ll protect and send him out now.” Several elders of the Divine Dao Pavilion said with sorrow on their faces. They were probably going to die here. But Qu Wushuang might have a chance to live if they joined forces to send him out.

But Qu Wushuang was still holding on as he glanced at Lin Yun. That swordsman had once humiliated him greatly in the Heavenly Dao Pavilion, but he had also given him courage in such a critical moment.

Lin Yun, where are your fangs?! Qu Wushuang inwardly roared. He then said, “I believe in him. I believe in Flower Burial!”
