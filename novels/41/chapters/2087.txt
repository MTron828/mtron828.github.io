Chapter 2088: Rights and Wrongs

Lin Yun was smart, so he naturally understood what she meant. It was painful to miss someone, but she was willing to bear the pain if someone had to bear it.

Su Ziyao came then left in a hurry. Lin Yun didn’t even have the opportunity to give her the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown he had prepared for her. Looking at the direction Su Ziyao left in, Lin Yun fell into deep thought. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“What are you looking at? She has already left.” A burst of laughter resounded. When Lin Yun turned around, he saw the Serene Dust Great Saint looking at him with a playful smile. Clearly, she had arrived some time ago.

“Mistress!” Lin Yun was briefly stunned before he rejoiced. He knew his Mistress would follow him. If he managed to retrieve the Sovereign Saint Sword, his two mistresses wouldn’t watch as he fell into danger. The Indigothunder Peak Master was uneasy, but Lin Yun never feared the Black Plume Palace.

“Since when did you hook up with the Ninth Princess? It’s troublesome to get involved with her,” the Seren Dust Great Saint said. She knew some of Su Ziyao’s past and that she possessed the?Divine Dragon Empire's royal clan bloodline.

“The Ninth Princess?” Lin Yun asked. “I only know she’s from the Profound Imperial Palace, but I never expected that she’s a princess.”

“The Profound Imperial Palace was established by the?royal clan of the Divine Dragon’s lineage. In its early years, everyone in it possessed the Divine Dragon’s bloodline. But the requirement had eased up a lot over the years. But the title of 'Dragon Heir' can only be received by those possessing the Divine Dragon’s bloodline.”

Lin Yun guessed that the title of a Dragon Heir should be similar to a Holy Son in holy lands.

“The Dragon Heir is sent to lesser realms while they are young to cultivate their imperial aura, so you must’ve gotten acquainted with her in the Profound Amber Realm,” the Serene Dust Great Saint guessed.

“That’s right,” Lin Yun acknowledged.

“She’s courageous.” The Serene Dust Great Saint dropped her smile and continued, “I shouldn’t be telling you about this, but you better think it through. If you get together with her, there will be a lot of obstacles and troubles along the way.”

“I’m not afraid,” Lin Yun smiled. He wanted to take on the path of a Sword God; even the Nine Emperors weren’t his goal. He wanted to become the unprecedented Sword God and sever everything with the sword. Compared to becoming a Sword God, the difficulties mentioned by the Serene Dust Great Saint were nothing.

“I did not disappoint,” Lin Yun said as he brought over the Sovereign Saint Sword with a hint of pride and handed it to the Serene Dust Great Saint.

The Serene Dust Great Saint was stunned when Lin Yun declared he wasn’t afraid and removed the Sovereign Saint Sword. His confidence would make others want to believe him. He looked like the Radiant Sword Saint from back then, who wasn’t afraid of any challenges. Receiving the Sovereign Saint Sword from Lin Yun, the Serene Dust Great Saint smiled, “You’re the same as your master.”

She had seen the fearless Radiant Sword Saint’s shadows from Lin Yun.

Lin Yun smiled upon hearing that. He suddenly thought of something and asked, “Will this sword help my master’s tribulation?”

“It’s not advisable to put all your hope on this sword. The purpose of this sword is to deal with Tian Xuanzi,” the Serene Dust Great Saint said. “Who do you think helped Tian Xuanzi borrow that sword? He doesn’t have that much face to borrow a Sovereign Saint Sword. The one who borrowed it for him is noble, and no one dares to provoke her. But Heavenly Jade and I don’t want Big Brother Wuming to suffer any grievances. Since others can have it, Big Brother Wuming will also have it. This is a matter between women.”

Lin Yun speculated that the Empress might have borrowed the Sovereign Saint Sword for Tian Xuanzi. But looking at the Serene Dust Great Saint, Lin Yun couldn’t help smiling. To a certain degree, Lin Yun envied his master.

“Are those from the Sword Sect all right?” Lin Yun asked.

“They’re fine. Bai Ziyuan is also here,” the Serene Dust Great Saint said.

Lin Yun was shocked that the two of them had come. After all, it was shocking to dispatch two?great saints at once.

“Do you think it’s unbelievable?” The Serene Dust Great Saint asked. “Not long after you left, the White Bone Blade Saint arrived. If not for that lass, today’s matter wouldn’t have ended so easily.”

“What is he here for?” Lin Yun frowned. He naturally knew about the White Bone Blade Saint, one of the seven saints of Black Mountain.

“The sword. What else? It’s a Sovereign Saint Sword that can be combined with the Firmament Sword to form a divine artifact,” the Serene Dust Great Saint said. She continued, “Now that the battle has ended, you can return to the Heavenly Dao Sect. I’ll keep the sword for now.”

Back at the Hidden Sword Manor, the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint and Abyssal Gale Great Saint were facing each other when the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint casually placed her sword on the table.

“Have you been using this sword all along?” The Abyssal Gale Great Saint asked, looking at the sword. This sword was called Soft Snow. It was personally forged by him five hundred years ago, and it was a famous sword back then within the Kunlun Realm.

“It’s a good sword,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said.

“You can change it now that there’s a better one,” the Abyssal Gale Great Saint smiled. The Abyssal Gale Great Saint was one of the few master blacksmiths in the world, and he had a good relationship with most swordsmen. The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint could be considered half an old friend of his.

“I prefer the old sword, and there’s no need to change,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said. “I’m sorry for what happened today. I knew you wouldn’t lend it to me if I asked, so I could only use this method.”

“It’s fine. How can young people be young if they aren’t cocky? Not to mention he held back. Shaoyu might be heavily injured, but his life isn’t in danger,” the Abyssal Gale Great Saint smiled. He didn’t look stubborn. It's as if he had undergone a drastic change.

The Abyssal Gale Great Saint’s generosity surprised the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint. After all, the Hidden Sword Manor was greatly embarrassed by this incident, but she couldn’t sense any rage within the Abyssal Gale Great Saint. This immediately made the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint cautious because she would have tried to compensate the Abyssal Gale Great Saint if he was angry. But she was in a difficult position upon seeing the smile on his face.

“These are his rewards as the champion of the Sword Assembly. He left in a hurry, so you can take it back on his behalf.” The Abyssal Gale Great Saint took out two bottles containing thirty Great Solar Saint Pellets and Great Lunar Saint Pellets. They were something so precious, a treasure to someone who had grasped sword intent, and even the Heavenly Dao Sect didn’t have much in stock.

But the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint felt uncertain, so she wasn’t in a hurry to take them.

“As for the Heavenly Dipper Sword, It’ll take some time to reforge it. I won’t let him suffer a loss. He can’t use the Cauldron Sword with his cultivation, so I’ll forge a Heavenly Dipper Sword that is compatible with him,” the Abyssal Gale Great Saint said sincerely.

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint briefly pondered before she said, “There’s no need for you to be so polite.”

The Abyssal Gale Sword Saint realized something and smiled, “Don’t overthink it. I’m really not bothered about it, and he might be the person the Hidden Sword Manor has been waiting for.”

“What person?” The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint asked.

“The true owner?of the Heavenly Dragon Seal. But I’m not certain now. I can only be certain after he steps onto the saint path,” the Abyssal Gale Great Saint said vaguely.

Far away, Feng Wuji stood in a palace, looking in a certain direction with a grave expression because the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint came personally. Feng Wuji couldn’t see the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint’s appearance with his cultivation because she was enveloped in radiance, but the sword intent radiating from her made him fearful. After all, she was one of the three sword saints within the Eastern Desolation, and even he?wasn’t qualified to entertain someone like her. Only the old man was qualified to entertain such an expert.

“Who are you looking at?” Feng Yu came over.

Feng Wuji frowned and reprimanded, “Hush. The old man is entertaining a big shot.”

The Kunlun Realm was a world where the strong were respected. Feng Wuji was only a Saint Sovereign, with a huge gap between him and the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint. Even if he became a Great Saint, there would still be a huge gap between him and the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint. After all, there were differences between the strengths of Great Saints.

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint had long reached the pinnacle as a Great Saint, and she could take that step out to reach the Emperor Realm at any moment. At that time, he wouldn’t have the qualifications to look at her directly, even if he was?the Hidden Sword Manor’s Manor Master.

“Oh, it’s the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint,” Feng Yu smiled. “Why are you so afraid? But then again, she doesn’t have a good temper.”

Right then, the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint seemed to have heard their conversation and turned to look over.

This scared Feng Wuji. He hissed, “Keep your voice down!”

“I’m not you. I have a good relationship with Big Sister Bai,” Feng Yu smiled. She left Feng Wuji behind and entered the pavilion that the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint and Abyssal Gale Great Saint were located at.

“Big Sister Bai, when did you come? Why didn’t you inform me about your arrival?” Feng Yu walked over to the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint. She knew the relationship between the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint and her master. She didn’t dare to address the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint as a ‘Mistress’ like Lin Yun, and she didn’t want to address the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint as a ‘Martial Aunt’ either.

The Abyssal Gale Great Saint’s face turned green upon hearing Feng Yu’s form of address. He and the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint were in the same generation, but Feng Yu addressed the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint as ‘Big Sister,’ so wouldn’t the seniority be messed up?

Just when he was about to reprimand Feng Yu about it, the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint smiled, “I came in a hurry, so I didn’t have time to inform you.”

“Hehe, why don’t you stay here for a few more days? What are you talking about with the old man? He’s stingy and a miser. Let’s go, I’ll show you around.” Feng Yu pulled the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint’s arm, wanting to bring her away.

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint smiled because she was also intending to leave. But before she stood up, she didn’t forget to take the two bottles off the table. After all, she had to bring those pellets back to Lin Yun.

“Father.” Feng Wuji rushed over with his forehead covered in sweat because he couldn’t stop Feng Yu.

The Abyssal Gale Great Saint sighed, “That lass only knows how to help outsiders. It looks like I have no control over her anymore.”

“I’ll bring her back immediately,” Feng Wuji said.

“Forget about it.” The Abyssal Gale Great Saint shook his head and sighed, “Perhaps I made a mistake back then, and Radiant was right. If he’s right, then some things cannot be ignored. After all, the rights and wrongs must be clear.”

Feng Wuji was stumped upon hearing that. Did I just hear my father admit defeat? That?stubborn old man who is the rival of the Radiant Sword Saint?
