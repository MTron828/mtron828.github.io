Chapter 1947 - Taking My Leave

Lin Yun wore a bitter expression and heaved a breath of relief because Bai Shuying didn’t seem to be here to question him. But the corner of his lips twitched when he noticed Bai Shuying’s cold gaze. He didn’t expect Bai Shuying to hold a grudge and wanted him to recite a poem.

He didn’t want to be tangled up in this matter and said, “I have no intentions of lying to you, and I do have a matter to handle and am planning to take a trip out today. I have no intention of lying to the holy maiden.”

“I don’t want to hear that. Just recite one, and I’ll let you off today. If you can’t recite one, I’ll have to suspect if you’re related to Zhang Yue’s lecherous poem,” Bai Shuying said indifferently.

Lin Yun opened his mouth and had no idea how the two were related.

But Bai Shuying had other thoughts, and she didn’t believe that the poems Ye Qingtian recited were taken from elsewhere and were created by him.

Lin Yun had no choice, and he could only put up a strong front and replied, “Let me think about it.”

“No need to hurry.” Bai Shuying poured a cup of tea for herself and drank it. Her expression was calm, and she suddenly smiled when she lifted her cup.

Before coming, she felt that Ye Qingtian might make things difficult for her, mocking her for going against her oath. But when she came, she made things difficult for Ye Qingtian instead.

Lin Yun happened to see Bai Shuying’s smile, and this made him briefly stunned. He had to admit that her smile was gorgeous, like a gorgeous jade.

Bai Shuying placed the cup down and barked when she saw Ye Qingtian staring at her, “Ye Qingtian, do you want me to dig your eyes out?”

“Senior Sister, you’re beautiful when you smile.” Lin Yun couldn’t help praising.

“What did you say?” Bai Shuying frowned.

Lin Yun smiled and quickly changed the topic, “You’re like jade, a lone orchid on the mountain with a floral fragrance spreading out along with the cold wind, and my lovesickness is like a long river in autumn.”

Bai Shuying was briefly stunned upon hearing that. Even if she couldn’t comprehend it, she roughly knew that Ye Qingtian must be talking about her. Since the poem mentioned the orchid, it naturally referred to her as the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden.

She was surprised because she purposely tried to put Ye Qingtian in a difficult position to ease her awkwardness. Most importantly, there was a part that touched her. When she pondered over what Ye Qingtian said, her gaze became dim. It turned out that Ye Qingtian was infatuated, and he misunderstood her. When she looked at Ye Qingtian again, Bai Shuying’s gaze eased up.

But before she could say anything, Lin Yun said, “If two are lovesick, it can be considered spending a lifetime together.”

Bai Shuying’s face changed, and she said, “Ye Qingtian, I never knew that you’re such a talented person. It looks like you’re the one who wrote that lecherous poem back then.”

Lin Yun inwardly smiled but tried his best to maintain his composure.

“But…” Bai Shuying changed her tone and said with a hint of guilt. “There’s no need for you to keep your attention on me. Like you, my heart is also on someone.”

“How are you so certain that the person I’m talking about is you?” Lin Yun smiled awkwardly.

Bai Shuying thought that Ye Qingtian was embarrassed, and she smiled, “That’s for the best.”

What Bai Shuying said made Lin Yun uncomfortable, and he could only change the topic with a smile, “I’m pretty curious about who the person you’ve fallen for is. I never heard that you’ve ever fallen for someone…”

He was honestly shocked. After all, Bai Shuying had rejected many geniuses; everyone she rejected was a peerless genius. There were even nobilities of the Divine Dragon Empire. But who would've thought that Bai Shuying’s heart was already on someone?

“It’s natural that you’ve not heard of it. This is also the first time I’m talking about this to someone, and I’ve only met him once… He said that he’d come to look for me within the Heavenly Dao Sect,” Bai Shuying said.

Lin Yun was confused about what Bai Shuying said.

“Is it weird?” Bai Shuying raised her head. “Didn’t you say back in the Nether Orchid Courtyard that there doesn’t need to be a reason to fall for someone? Perhaps just a sight is enough for someone to fall for another person.”

Lin Yun opened his mouth and was speechless because he was only casually talking about it. But his instincts told him that it shouldn’t be reliable about this person that Bai Shuying fell for.

“Why didn’t he come, then?” Lin Yun asked.

Bai Shuying’s gaze became dim, and she said, “I don’t know. But someone like him shouldn’t go against his promise.”𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

As she spoke, she thought about that person's experience, and her gaze lit up when she recalled what she saw back then.

This further confirmed within Lin Yun’s heart that the man Bai Shuying fell for must be a scumbag.

Bai Shuying hid her thoughts and smiled, “It looks like I’ve misunderstood you, and I apologize. You’re deeply in love, and that’s also the same for me. I don’t care about you and Wang Muyan, as it has nothing to do with me, and I realized that I have a deep misunderstanding with you. I thought you’d make things difficult for me. It now appears that I’m too narrow-minded.”

Her sincerity made Lin Yun feel uncomfortable, and he quickly cupped his hands together, “Holy maiden, you’re too serious. Ye… I can’t accept your apology.”

He initially wanted to say Ye Qingtian but used ‘I’ instead after thinking about something.

Bai Shuying naturally didn’t notice this, and she laughed, “It’s fine. I have something to talk to you about.”

“Holy Maiden, please,” Lin Yun said.

“My master instructed me to invite you to the Nether Orchid Courtyard seven days from now. Not only you, but all the talented swordsmen within the Heavenly Dao Sect will be present, and my master will guide everyone personally,” Bai Shuying finally went into the topic.

“This is good,” Lin Yun smiled.

“But…” Bai Shuying briefly paused before she said in a hesitant voice, “My master wanted me to come and invite you instead and not her.”

Lin Yun was briefly stunned before he laughed, “I understand. If the Dragon Origin Great Saint asked about it, I will properly address it.”

“That’s good.” Bai Shuying heaved a breath of relief and smiled. She finally completed the task her master gave her, and she asked, “Junior Brother Ye, have you heard of the Sword Assembly?”

“I’ve naturally heard of it,” Lin Yun said. He didn’t only hear about it, but he also participated in a small-scale Sword Assembly.

A small-scaled Sword Gathering Assembly would be held within the Hidden Sword Pavilion’s branches, while the Hidden Sword Manor would hold a large-scale Sword Assembly. This was a grand event for all swordsmen in the world.

He briefly pondered and asked, “Will the Heavenly Dao Sect also participate?”

“It’s nothing in the past but different this time. My master seems to be serious about it this time, which is why she wanted to gather all the swordsmen within the Heavenly Dao Sect, including the saint disciples outside the sect,” Bai Shuying said.

“I remember that anyone beneath the Quasi-Saint Realm can participate in it. So the meaning behind me participating doesn’t mean much,” Lin Yun smiled.

Bai Shuying embarrassedly said, “That’s what I said to my master.”

Seeing Bai Shuying’s expression, Lin Yun couldn’t help smiling because it was rare for him to see Bai Shuying shy.

“But since my master asked you to come over, she must have a reason. Even if you don’t participate in the Sword Assembly, your attainment in the sword will greatly improve with my master’s guidance,” Bai Shuying said sincerely.

“I will be there,” Lin Yun agreed.

“Senior Brother, there’s trouble!” Chen Feng anxiously ran into the courtyard. He said, “Senior Brother, Ye Feifan is here!”

“He’s only a mere loser. So why are you panicking?” Lin Yun smiled.

As Chen Feng gasped for breath, he said, “He has two Quasi-Saints and a Saint following him, and they’re all from the Ye Clan.”

“Ye Clan?” Lin Yun’s eyes flickered.

But he had already predicted this day to occur. It was natural that Ye Qingtian would arouse suspicion with the sudden boost in his strength. But he didn’t panic as he said, “Holy Maiden, I’ll be taking my leave first.”
