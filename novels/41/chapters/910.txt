Chapter 911 - Who Is It

Mo Han had an infamous reputation for those outside of the Azure Dragon Ranking. After all, many people fell victim to his halberd. With his chilling aura, there was no way that someone like him wouldn’t attract everyone’s attention since his existence was like a bright sun.

Soon after, two more figures appeared. It was the Nethercloud Realm’s Shi Feng and Chen An. Based on the huge contrast in their physiques, they drew everyone’s attention.

There were many geniuses gathered in the Flamefeather City, but only four geniuses deserved to be called monsters. All four of them owned dao artifacts and were right below the Azure Dragon Ranking.

With three of the four monstrous geniuses present, the atmosphere became very lively. But just as the crowd started getting out of hand, a faint killing aura appeared that made everyone’s heart tremble. The source of the killing aura was so terrifying that everyone felt a little uncomfortable.

“Feng Wuji is here!” Everyone knew who it was.

Feng Wuji, who wore black clothes, glanced at the barried before heading towards the crowd. When everyone saw that Feng Wuji was coming, they quickly retracted their gazes to avoid eye contact.

Feng Wuji’s name was the most infamous of the four geniuses and everyone knew about the Bloodbone Realm’s reputation in the Azure Dragon Region. It was common knowledge that Feng Wuji and the Bloodbone Realm couldn’t be provoked.

When Liu Yun saw Feng Wuji’s appearance, his face uncontrollably became pale.

“What’s wrong?” Chen Xuan naturally noticed Liu Yun’s weird behaviour and asked.

Liu Yun hesitated briefly before he ultimately told Chen Xuan how he took the Blood Sun Fruit from Feng Wuji. Since Lin Yun was standing nearby, he naturally heard their conversation. Simultaneously, he figured out why Liu Yun was acting so strange earlier. A 3,000 year old Blood Sun Fruit was a considerable harvest.

But seeing how afraid Liu Yun was when Feng Wuji appeared, it was too late.

“You fool!” Chen Xuan’s face changed drastically as he began reprimanding Liu Yun. “Don’t you know that geniuses from the higher realms will definitely get their revenge? Not to mention that it’s Feng Wuji. It will be impossible for him to act as if nothing happened!”

When Qin Feng and Yan Kui heard what Liu Yun said, they both had fear in their eyes. Liu Yun was too bold to dare to steal from Feng Wuji. It would be a huge win if Feng Wuji didn’t come after him.

What Chen Xuan said made Liu Yun’s heart beat wildly as he started to panic. Recalling those who were slain by Feng Wuji, Liu Yun’s face became pale as he trembled, “Senior brother, you have to help me. What should I do now? Should I just give it back to him?”

“It’s already too late,” sighed Chen Xuan. “Since you weren’t seen by him, he definitely doesn’t know that you took the Blood Sun Fruit. It’ll be fine as long as you don’t reveal any flaws. Then again, the best situation would be that Feng Wuji already forgot about it.”

Listening to what Chen Xuan said, Liu Yun could only nod his head uneasily because he didn’t have any other options.

At this moment, a torrential killing aura soared into the sky that practically tore the clouds apart. The crowd clamored because the source of the killing aura was Feng Wuji.

After Feng Wuji arrived, he had been sweeping his gaze around like he was looking for someone. When he retracted his gaze, he unleashed his killing aura and made everyone around him nervous. At the same time, his face became even colder.

Just what was going on with Feng Wuji? Everyone was confused and guessed that Feng Wuji was trying to chase everyone away. But there was no need for him to do that since only Mo Han, Shi Feng, and Chen An could compete with him. Even the other geniuses from higher realms wouldn’t dare to compete for the Glorysun Spirit.

“One of you took something from me,” said Feng Wuji while everyone felt uneasy. His voice wasn’t loud, but everyone could clearly hear him. Hearts sank as the crowd wondered who would be bold enough to steal something from Feng Wuji?

“I can grant you a straightforward death if you step forward right now. Don’t force me to pick you out one by one!” Feng Wuji snorted and swept his cold gaze around. No one dared to meet with his eyes as they looked at the ground. Even the innocent people were feeling guilty.

Out of the blue, Feng Wuji grabbed someone from the crowd and asked coldly, “Did you steal my Blood Sun Fruit?”

The person who was grabbed by Feng Wuji in the throat turned pale and begged, “N-n-no. Not me!”

“Look into my eyes,” said Feng Wuji coldly. In the end, his victim was forced to look at him in the eye while he trembled incessantly. Then, Feng Wuji said indifferently, “Not you.”

But before his victim could let out a breath of relief, Feng Wuji’s had already snapped his neck. As for the victim’s teammates, they could only cower in fear. Feng Wuji was simply too brutal to kill an innocent bystander. But it made sense since the geniuses from other realms had nothing to do with him. Naturally, Feng Wuji didn’t care who he killed.𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“You don’t dare to admit it? Fine, but I’m going to have fun playing with you once I find you!” Feng Wuji walked through the crowd and would occasionally grab someone before killing them. In just a brief moment, there were already ten victims.

He was killing anyone that looked suspicious to him. With that, the surrounding atmosphere became tense because no one knew if they would be the next victim. On the other hand, geniuses from higher realms were calm and composed while they watched.

It would still take some time for the barrier to weaken, so they might as well watch the show Feng Wuji was putting on for them. After the tenth person’s death, Liu Yun’s face was completely pale and his legs shook with fear.

The faces of Chen Xuan and the others were also pale because Feng Wuji didn’t forget about the Blood Sun Fruit. The current situation had actually surpassed their wildest imagination.

As Feng Wuji swept his glance around, his gaze eventually fell on Chen Xuan’s party. However, his gaze was on Lin Yun. After all, the geniuses in the surroundings were trembling with fear and only Lin Yun was calm. Naturally, he stood out.

“Was it you? Did you steal my Blood Sun Fruit? You do have some courage since you aren’t shaking. You’re the only one who isn’t trembling. Wow, your courage has blown me away,” said Feng Wuji while looking at Lin Yun.

Lin Yun merely looked at Feng Wuji in silence. Feng Wuji’s explanation made sense, but his conclusion was wrong. However, Feng Wuji was wrong. The person that stole his Blood Sun Fruit wasn’t courageous, he was stupid.

“Get your ass over here and beg for death!” Feng Wuji barked. His voice echoed in everyone's ears, which made everyone tremble. They all knew that Lin Yun was doomed. It didn’t matter if Lin Yun didn’t steal the Blood Sun Fruit. He had already attracted Feng Wuji’s attention, which was a death sentence.

Furthermore, Feng Wuji hadn’t revealed such a terrifying killing intent until now. This sudden scene caught Chen Xuan by surprise. He didn’t expect that Feng Wuji wouldn’t come after Liu Yun but would target Lin Yun.

Liu Yun was also surprised because he never expected that Feng Wuji would place his attention on Lin Yun. Although he didn’t like Lin Yun, there was no reason for Lin Yun to take the fall for him. However, he still didn’t have the courage to admit his mistake.

“Sorry. I don’t understand what you’re saying,” said Lin Yun coldly without any expression on his face.

Looking at Lin Yun’s reaction, Feng Wuji laughed instead of losing his temper. Solemnly, he spoke with Lin Yun, “You’re truly courageous. Do you dare to say that you’re not the one who stole my Blood Sun Fruit? Aside from you, who else has the courage to speak to me in this manner?!”

“Who cares if I took the Blood Sun Fruit or didn’t? Did it have your name on it? Who the hell do you think you are to claim that an item without an owner belongs to you?” Lin Yun replied with his eyes flashing coldly.

He wasn’t standing up for Liu Yun, he simply didn’t like Feng Wuji’s attitude. Most importantly, Lin Yun had no reason to fear Feng Wuji. The conversation between Lin Yun and Feng Wuji was short, but everyone could feel the bond that went off.

It was simply unbelievable to think that someone dared to talk back to Feng Wuji.
