Chapter 969 - Azure Dragon Seven Constellations!

Luo Chen smiled at Lin Yun who was in deep thought. “You don’t have to think too much about it. We already know about your divine astral pellets. We don’t have any interest in your pellets, your advanced fortune martial technique or dao artifact. So no need to worry.”

Unlike the elites from the higher realms, Luo Chen, Jun Mengchen, and Qin Lin didn’t have any enmity towards Lin Yun. After reaching a certain level, the seven heads had a completely different mindset than normal people. Lin Yun could tell that they weren’t lying as he could also sense an immense divine astral pellet’s aura coming from them.

Based on their dangerous aura, Lin Yun was certain that they also knew monarch fortune martial techniques. He was also certain that they had greater dao artifacts and possibly even transcendent dao artifacts.

“Lin Yun, the Heavenly Path is huge and the Azure Dragon Region is only one of four regions. In the future we will leave the Azure Dragon Region and face the other regions, we might even have an opportunity to work together,” smiled Luo Chen. “Although we can’t work together right now, we can still befriend each other. What do you think?”

Luo Chen’s foresight truly surprised Lin Yun. Lin Yun smiled and responded, “I’m honored to hear such words from you.”

This was how Lin Yun had always been. He would respect those who respected him. Then again, he also wouldn’t flatter Luo Chen just because Luo Chen was the Azure Dragon Region’s chief. As a swordsman, Lin Yun naturally had his own pride.

“Well said.” Luo Chen nodded. “I can see that you aren’t interested in the Cloud Soul Sect’s inheritance. You’re intending to head towards the seven constellation palaces, right?”

“Are you doing that too?” Lin Yun replied with a question.

“Yes and no. What’s more important to us in the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm is the Azure Dragon Palace. After all, there will be inheritances that are far beyond imagination!” Luo Chen’s face had turned grave when he mentioned the Azure Dragon Palace.

Inheritances that surpasses imagination? Lin Yun was deeply shocked when he heard that. This was the first time he had heard of such a thing. It was all but confirmed that the seven heads possessed monarch fortune martial techniques. After all, they were only interested in opportunities that surpassed fortune martial techniques. Lin Yun continued to chat before everyone went their separate ways.

“Luo Chen, aren’t you thinking too highly of Lin Yun? We’re optimistic about his potential, but…” Jun Mengchen looked at Luo Chen with doubt in his eyes. Qin Lin paid attention because he felt the same way. Although they had witnessed Lin Yun’s strength and acknowledged his potential, Luo Chen’s attitude didn’t make sense. Luo Chen talked to Lin Yun like they were on the same level.

“No, his potential isn’t just shocking. He already possesses a terrifying power. Although he hid it well, I can still sense it…” Luo Chen paused briefly before he smiled, “If those four misjudged Lin Yun’s strength, it’ll be something interesting to watch.”

The four he was talking about were naturally the other seven heads on the Azure Dragon Ranking. Clearly, they weren’t united as a group.

“Are you serious?” The doubt on Jun Mengchen’s face became denser. Could it be that Lin Yun had trump cards that could compete with them?

“Aren’t your words a little too unbelievable?” Qin Lin also didn’t believe Luo Chen’s words.

With a gentle smile, Luo Chen said, “I’m not exaggerating anything. He had started refining divine astral pellets when he reached the Heavenly Soul Realm. We only started that when we were in the third soul Heavenly Soul Realm. In terms of foundation, he might actually be stronger than us. Furthermore, I can also sense two auras from him, which means there is a high possibility that he practices two different cultivation techniques at the same time. Then there’s the matter of the ice beauty. It seems like he catches her attention for an entirely different reason.”

Pei Xue, who was suddenly dragged into the topic, yawned, “I don’t know anything, so don’t ask me. Anyway, I’m heading to the Glorygold Constellation Palace, so don’t follow me.” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

When she was done speaking, purple light intertwined and distorted space as she disappeared. It was a bizarre movement technique that made others envious.

Qin Lin pondered briefly before he continued, “That woman must know something. Mengchen and I saw her make a move against Lin Yun. Back then, Lin Yun’s strength wasn't as dazzling as it is now. There must be a special reason why.”

Spreading his arms apart, Luo Chen said, “If the ice beauty doesn’t want to say it, no one can force her. Which constellation palaces do you guys want to go to?”

“Gloryfire Constellation Palace.”

“Alright. I don’t have much interest in the other constellation palaces.” The three chatted as if the seven constellation palaces were something to pick from. It made sense since they didn’t have many opponents in the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm.

After bidding farewell to Luo Chen’s group, Lin Yun continued on his journey. Lin Yun wanted to ask Pei Xue about her grudge with Yue Weiwei and what trouble Yue Weiwei was in, but Pei Xue didn’t say anything. So Lin Yun didn’t force her to say anything because he was certain she wouldn’t tell him.

Putting the issue of Pei Xue aside, Lin Yun spent three full days traveling. He moved at full speed while he approached dense astral energy.

The astral energy was so dense that it formed a fog. However, it also had a trace of demonic aura mixed in, which was difficult to refine. At the same time, the surrounding space became more damaged with spatial fragments and floating rocks.

Instantly, Lin Yun knew that he was on a battlefield from ancient times. He knew that he would see a lot of similar scenes to Baili Qi dying even after reaching the Divine Core Realm.

“I’m almost at the depths of the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm.” Lin Yun could sense that the people along the way had decreased. It was especially apparent when he passed by groups with cultivators who weren’t any weaker than Liu Mu.

After he got acquainted with Luo Chen, Lin Yun realized that there were many hidden dragons and crouching tigers in the Azure Dragon Region. It was best for him to be cautious until he had enough strength. Then again, he didn’t mind teaching a lesson to anyone that looked down on him.

An hour later, Lin Yun sensed a heat in the atmosphere that made his blood boil. Lin Yun raised his head, “This sensation is a little familiar.”

He could see flames stretching across the sky, which made his eyes hurt. The flames were the same flames that were on the divine astral pellets, “Astral flames…”

Lin Yun couldn’t imagine what would happen if the astral flames hit the ground. But as Lin Yun got closer, he saw a distorted space deep in the sea of flames.

He could see seven majestic palaces within the distorted space that were shrouded in different colors. The palaces also had various phenomena that made them look sacred. Lin Yun also heard a faint song lingering in space that spoke of an era that had already passed.

“The Azure Dragon Seven Constellations!” Lin Yun looked at the majestic phenomena and recognized the seven constellation palaces.

“So where is the Glorysun Constellation Palace…” After some time, Lin Yun found the Glorysun Constellation Palace that was shining like a golden sun. But if he wanted to enter it, he had to go through the sea of flames. They were flames that could easily stop a cultivator beneath the third soul Heavenly Soul Realm.

Even cultivators above the third soul Heavenly Soul Realm had to be cautious because they would be completely incinerated if they weren’t careful. At this moment, there were many people who were charging into the sea of flames.

Lin Yun also didn’t hesitate because he knew that the Azure Dragon Array was set up by the Dragon Gate, which probably had a connection to the Iris Sword Saint. There was a chance that Lin Yun might even be able to find the complete sword sutra left behind by Iris Sword Saint somewhere among the Azure Dragon Seven Constellations. He could also find out more information about his sword box.

The blazing heat coming from the sea of flames started to turn Lin Yun’s skin red. Furthermore, his origin energy even showed signs of bursting into flames because of the astral flame. As he raised his head, the seven constellation palaces turned into mirages in the desert. Lin Yun began to wonder how many people had died to reach the Azure Dragon Seven Constellations.

“My cultivation is too low and I’ll be exhausted to death if I simply rely on my origin energy. Looks like I have to use my sword intent to charge forward…” Lin Yun muttered. He didn’t dare to risk the Azure Dragon Battle Physique with these flames. If he ran out of origin energy, he would probably be incinerated in an hour. So he could only pray that his sword intent would be enough.
