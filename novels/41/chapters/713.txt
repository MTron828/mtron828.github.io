Chapter 714 - Compete

Lin Yun’s strong stance shocked Chen Ziyu and the rest. But a moment later, killing aura began to surge in their pupils. In Chen Ziyu’s view, Lin Yun was truly courting death. He wanted to spare Lin Yun’s life, but the latter didn’t appreciate it at all. After all, the seven geniuses didn’t want to waste time on Lin Yun and miss out on the Demonification Fruit.

They were all geniuses with outstanding strength, but they could tell that Lin Yun wasn’t weak, especially with his xiantian sword intent at complete mastery. It was easy to defeat him, but killing him was another issue. No one was confident that they could kill Lin Yun anytime soon and they would definitely waste a lot of time if they fought.

So they had to make a decision soon. While they were pondering, the radiance soaring into the sky from the tree became even denser. Then, the entire tree began to shake, causing the leaves to start falling like snow.

Chen Ziyu stretched out to catch a leaf and his face changed. This was a sign that the Demonification Fruits were about to mature. Right at this moment, everyone soared into the sky as they headed towards the towering tree.

“Seize the Demonification Fruits first. We’ll kill him later!” Chen Ziyu snorted before he soared into the sky. Chu Muyan also spread his arms apart as he flew towards the Demonification Tree like an eagle.

No one cared about Lin Yun anymore as they charged towards the Demonification Tree. They clearly never expected that the Demonification Fruits would mature so quickly. For now, they had to let go of Lin Yun. After all, the Demonification Fruits were more important.

“We’ll spare you for now,” said the Jin brothers as they glanced at Lin Yun coldly. This had embarrassed them greatly, so they were naturally unhappy with Lin Yun. It didn’t take long for the trees to be filled with people.

But Lin Yun didn’t move as he unleashed his sword intent to probe the unusual towering tree. The tree was so colossal that it looked like a mountain. But if one looked at it carefully, they would notice that there were nine different segments. The Demonification Fruits at the bottom only had a wisp of crimson aura.

The fruits themselves looked like thousands of stars hanging on the tree. Right at this moment, a Demonification Fruit suddenly swelled up and exploded, killing a pinnacle Yin-Yang stage by surprise. But that wasn’t all as the fluctuation from the explosion caused more fruits to start exploding. In that split moment, countless cultivators were caught by explosions and began to fall from the tree.

The Demonification Tree itself was emitting immense pressure, so going up the tree was like carrying a mountain on one's shoulders. It was easy to imagine how terrible it was to be turned into minced meat. The fruits themselves were dangerous, which made it seem like the cultivators weren’t the biggest obstacle.

A dragon roar echoed from within Lin Yun’s body as he circulated the Azure Dragon Enneaform. His blood began to boil as he was shrouded in a purple mist. Right at this moment, he had unleashed his Azure Dragon aura without any restraints.

Like a sword ray, Lin Yun soared into the sky and reached the sixth segment of the Demonification Tree. The Demonification Fruits in this region had at least six strands of aura enveloping them. There was no question that the strands of aura represented the odds of awakening martial intent.

Geniuses and powerful wandering cultivators were gathered on this segment and higher. They couldn’t even be bothered to look at the Demonification Fruits on the lowest level. When Lin Yun landed on a thick tree, an immense pressure weighed down on him, suppressing 30% of his movement technique. But the situation was even more terrible for others as they could barely even bring out 50% of their movement technique.

“Demonification Fruit!” Lin Yun swept a glance at a crimson fruit on a tree branch not far away. It looks like his luck wasn't that bad. Although there appeared to be countless Demonification Fruits, finding them wasn’t easy after coming in.

The further one went, there were less Demonification Fruit. So he was considered pretty lucky. But there were many experts here and the competition was brutal. Unfortunately, the Jin brothers and Qin Xu weren’t too far away. In addition to those three monstrous geniuses, there were also many demonic cultivators in the pinnacle Yin-Yang stage.

Without any change in his expression, Lin Yun headed towards the Demonification Fruit.

“Get lost!”

“Sword slave, you’re courting death!” The Jin brothers became enraged when they saw Lin Yun and immediately attacked him. They threw out their palms, unleashing torrential flames towards Lin Yun. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

But Lin Yun merely placed his thumb on his middle finger and circulated his Iris Sword Sutra. When he flicked his finger, a dazzling sword ray shot out and destroyed the flaming palms. Destroying their attacks, Lin Yun stepped forward. He was a lot closer to the Demonification Fruit now.

Although he had slowed down because of the Jin brothers, the others didn’t get any closer to the fruit either. Everyone was all looking at Lin Yun with killing aura surging in their pupils.

“Get lost or die!” Qin Xu swept his glance over and unleashed his aura, which manifested into a demonic ape. Qin Xu was known for his powerful physique. He had a fortunate encounter and obtained a Demonic Ape’s cultivation technique, which he trained to the peak. His physique was comparable to an ancient demonic ape, so he could tear a Yin-Yang stage demonic beast with his bare hands.

Previously when Chen Ziyu and Chu Muyan wanted to slaughter Lin Yun, he was the first to stand up to get everyone to gang up on Lin Yun. In his view, Lin Yun was just an annoying fly. This was why he was so enraged that Lin Yun dared to come.

“Cut the crap. Force me out if you’re capable of it,” said Lin Yun. He couldn’t even be bothered with Qin Xu as he continued forward.

“You’re courting death! A mere sword slave like you dares to compete with me?” Qin Xu suddenly stretched out his hand, which grew into a black furry hand with sharp nails. When he moved his hand, the surrounding atmosphere began to tremble as the hand came crashing down on Lin Yun.

Lin Yun also stretched his hand out as he poured eleven dragon runes into it, emitting a dazzling lightning. When the two hands collided, an explosion left a crack in the air as surges of ominous aura poured into Lin Yun’s arm, shredding his sleeve into pieces. In just a split second, his entire arm was covered in blood.

“You’re still too tender to compete with me!” Qin Xu sneered as he took a step forward and grabbed onto Lin Yun’s fist, unleashing black aura from his arm that shrouded Lin Yun’s arm.

“Die!” Qin Xu grinned with a sinister expression. He wanted to rip Lin Yun’s arm off before throwing him to the ground. If Lin Yun fell down from such height, there was no question that he would die.

“Lin Yun is going to die. His arm got grabbed by Qin Xu.”

“The two Jin brothers are also coming. He’s finished.”

“He’s too bold to actually come here.” The seven geniuses were the center of attention, so this matter instantly attracted everyone’s gazes.

The thick tree branches began to tremble from the Jin brothers’ killing aura as they charged over. Whenever they took a step, they would leave their footprints on the tree branch, causing the entire tree branch to tremble. But Lin Yun didn’t panic as he raised his left hand with a sword ray starting to accumulate in his nail.

“You want to repeat what you did earlier?” Qin Xu sneered. Then, his entire arm transformed into an ancient demonic ape’s arm.

Lin Yun smirked. He raised his left hand only to attract Qin Xu’s attention. In the blink of an eye, Lin Yun left behind an afterimage and formed an ancient seal in front of his chest.

The Azure Dragon Mark on Lin Yun’s chest became active as a terrifying aura was unleashed. Simultaneously, he finished forming his seal with his left hand, which emitted a boundless azure radiance.

While this occurred, the wounds on his right arm recovered at a terrifying speed. His right arm also began to swell, breaking free of the black tentacles manifested from Qin Xu’s aura. Then, blood began to splatter out from Qin Xu’s palm. This made Qin Xu yell out in pain with fear reflected in his pupils as he wanted to retreat.

“You want to leave? Too late…Azure Dragon Palm!” Lin Yun roared as his right hand turned into a dragon claw that grabbed onto Qin Xu’s wrist. He then lifted Qin Xu before throwing him at the Jin brothers.

“Shit!” The Jin brothers cursed when they saw Qin Xu flying at them. They quickly began to form flaming armor on their bodies. When they collided, the three of them threw up a mouthful of blood before they flew a thousand meters away.

By the time they got back on their feet, Lin Yun had already seized the Demonification Fruit. This made the three geniuses’ faces ugly. They had been humiliated, unable to do anything to Lin Yun.
