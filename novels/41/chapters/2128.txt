Chapter 2129: Biggest Winner

Even so, they didn’t dare to be careless and used various means to smash the skeleton into ashes before they were finally relieved. As the three approached the silver coffin, they lowered their heads and found some items buried with the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit.

There were a lot of round silver metal pieces that looked like copper coins, with patterns engraved on the front and back. The copper pieces looked ordinary, but when they held onto them, the copper coins felt extraordinary as they had many saint runes engraved.

“These should be some ancient coins passed among Saint Realm experts…the power of these coins is ancient. Perhaps we can absorb it directly.” Cao Yang weighed the coins in his hand and gritted his teeth, feeling tempted to try and bite it with his teeth, but he ultimately held himself back.

“These are the Imperial Dragon Coins. They’re forged with meteorites containing primal chaos aura. It can aid Saint Realm experts to cultivate. In ancient times, experts used them as currency, and I have some kept at my home,” Mo Li explained.

Cao Yang was excited because he picked up a treasure. The three counted the items and split the three hundred Imperial Dragon Coins, which could be considered a huge harvest. Aside from that, the coffin had four items: a bamboo flute, a jade pendant, a dagger, and a silver dragon-shaped bracelet. Many small bells on the bracelet produced a piece of ethereal music.

Mo Li chose the flute, Cao Yang took the dagger, and Lin Yun picked the jade pendant. They could tell the bracelet had the highest value, which should at least be a Twospirit Glory Saint Artifact. It was exquisite and could pique the joy in everyone’s hearts. With one treasure left, the three wanted it, and they fell silent.

“Uh…” Cao Yang opened his mouth. He wanted to say that he took the harshest beating and that the bracelet should go to him. But when he opened his mouth, Lin Yun and Mo Li looked over. This made Cao Yang smile awkwardly, and he smiled, “The two of you saved my life, and I’ll give up on this bracelet.”

“You do not qualify to obtain it, to begin with,” Mo Li replied. He continued, “Ye Qingtian, you can take out a treasure to exchange for it, and I can give up for it as well. Otherwise, we can exchange three moves and see who obtains this bracelet.”

“You should’ve grasped the ice and lightning martial intents, right?” Lin Yun asked.

Mo Li squinted because his ice martial intent was a secret, and he didn’t know how Lin Yun managed to notice it. He replied, “So?”

“A Thunderfrost Saint Fruit for you to give up on it. As for exchanging three moves, there’s no meaning in it. Swordsmen don’t spar and only fight to the death!” Lin Yun smiled. His cultivation was the lowest, and he would naturally suffer a loss if they were about to determine the ownership of this bracelet in three moves. So he hoped Mo Li could be wise and not play small tricks on him.

“Have you not heard of my Heavenly Note Demonic Canon before?” Mo Li asked coldly. He had a strong stance and released his greater dao. The bell above him also began to ring, releasing a terrifying aura that felt like a volcano that would erupt the next moment.

Lin Yun raised his brow and drew out the Flower Burial Sword. He said, “My sword is also sharp.”

Lin Yun’s aura drastically transformed, like an invisible sword was brewing in the air. This made Mo Li’s heart tremble because he could sense a dangerous aura, which made him tense up. He instantly knew that Lin Yun couldn’t be underestimated.

The two began to clash in the air, and Mo Li decided to step back. He didn’t want to engage in a life-and-death battle with Lin Yun because it wasn’t worth it, not to mention he would receive the Thunderfrost Saint Fruit. The True Dragon Secret Realm lacked saint fruits, but saint fruits containing ice and lightning attributes were rare.

Cao Yang opened his mouth, and his eyes bulged out, seeing that Lin Yun would use the Thunderfrost Saint Fruit to exchange for the bracelet. Didn’t the saint fruit belong to him? This naturally made Cao Yang furious, but he couldn’t say that and could only slam his palm on the coffin with a grievance. He felt irritated and turned around to leave, saying, “I’ll take my leave first. I won’t return to this accursed place even if I die.”

“It looked like Brother Cao suffered a grievance.” Mo Li toyed with the saint fruit in his hand with a smile. The saint fruit was extraordinary and rarer than he had expected, which he was satisfied with.

“Maybe,” Lin Yun replied with a smile.

“Let’s go.” The two walked out of the bronze palace together, chatting. When they separated, Mo Li waited till Lin Yun disappeared before he squinted.

“Ha,” Mo Li sneered. As he took a deep breath, he turned around, executing a ghost spirit movement technique, and returned to where he came from with lightning speed. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Two hours later, a figure appeared before the bronze gate, donning a cloak and a mask that enveloped himself. This person had a robust figure, looking cautious as his gaze fell onto the bronze gate with a smile after confirming that there wasn’t anyone.

“Cao Yang, do you think I can’t recognize you?” But just when this cloaked figure wanted to open the bronze gate, a cold voice sounded behind him.

The cloaked figure turned around and exclaimed, “Mo Li!”

Cao Yang didn’t expect even Mo Li to return, and the cloaked figure was naturally the Ancient Vajra Monastery’s Cao Yang. Mo Li sneered, “I already knew that you wanted to steal the coffin after seeing how you slapped the coffin at the end. You’re the shame of the Buddhist Cult.”

Cao Yang’s face blushed, and he sneered, “Don’t pretend that you’re any different. Despite your noble and elegant appearance, you’re nothing more than a beast. I might be the shame of the Ancient Vajra Monastery, but you’re not any different either. Aren’t you also here for the coffin?”

They both knew none of the treasures they obtained in the bronze hall could compete with the silver coffin's value. The treasures they received were valuable, but they could see the origin of those items. Only the silver coffin was enveloped in saint radiance and mystery. They couldn’t recognize the origin of the coffin, and it must be a treasure.

Mo Li and Cao Yang pretended not to be concerned earlier, trying to fool everyone, making it convenient for them to obtain the coffin later.

Mo Li said, “You’re merely someone who lost to me. Get lost, or I’ll turn you into ashes right now!”

Mo Li was prideful and didn’t place Cao Yang in his eyes. They fought multiple times, and Cao Yang never beat him once. This was where he got his confidence from.

“Mo Li, don’t push it!” Cao Yang said with a rage of flames blazing in his eyes.

“So what if I’m pushing it? Get lost if you don’t want to die!” Mo Li replied.

Cao Yang was furious but a little scared of Mo Li as he lost all their battles. He also didn’t want to leave just like that either. Even Ye Qingtian, who was in the Nirvana Stage, dared to face Mo Li. So why couldn’t he do it as well?

Cao Yang decided to go all out and roared, “My fist is also hard!”

The corner of Mo Li’s lip twitched. He couldn’t take Cao Yang’s stupidity any longer and roared, “Do you think you’re a swordsman? Your bones are as tough as Ye Qingtian’s sword? You won’t give up if I don’t teach you a lesson. Kneel!”

Mo Li flew into a rage, his hair fluttering wildly as murderous intent boiled in his eyes. He was genuinely furious this time. He might be unable to deal with Ye Qingtian, but Cao Yang thought too highly of himself.

Cao Yang regretted the moment he said that. When he saw Mo Li in a rage, he immediately cowered, but he still maintained a strong stance on his face despite his legs trembling. This was because the Quasi-Saint aura released by Mo Li was too terrifying.

Right then, the ground began to tremble with a huge sound coming from the bronze palace. This instantly made Cao Yang and Mo Li’s faces change as they turned to look at the bronze gate. They were baffled about what was going on and if the demonspirits had returned to life.

“Let’s open the gates first,” Cao Yang said, breaking the silence. They were dumbfounded when they opened the bronze gate because the silver coffin had disappeared. There was a huge crack at the far end of the hall, with Astral Sword Intent lingering at the crack. With a glance, anyone could tell that a sword created this crack.

“It’s Ye Qingtian! Chase after him!” Mo Li and Cao Yang immediately entered the crack and chased, but they couldn’t see Ye Qingtian anywhere. Not only were they unable to find Lin Yun, they couldn’t even sense any aura he left behind, which was weird. When they chased out of the underground palace, they couldn’t see anyone.

“Ye Qingtian!” Mo Li finally couldn’t hold it and gave himself a facepalm. He didn’t expect Ye Qingtian to return and take the silver coffin.

“That fellow is really fast.” Cao Yang looked dispirited as he continued, “We’re both fooled by him.”

Mo Li said pridefully, “You still didn’t realize it yet? He hasn’t left, and he hid himself in the bronze palace. The crack is only a trap to lure us away.”

“What?” Cao Yang was shocked.

Mo Li said coldly, “Only you’re fooled by him. So don’t compare me with you. Not to mention, I didn’t suffer a loss either because I have at least received a Thunderfrost Saint Fruit from him.

Cao Yang was furious and wanted to laugh simultaneously, looking at Mo Li’s prideful expression. He said, “You retard. That Thunderfrost Saint Fruit belonged to me. Furthermore, your senses were right about the pillars back then. They’re glory spirit saint runes and all taken by him. He’s the biggest winner, so stop pretending in front of me.”

“H-how is this possible…” Mo Li was stumped, looking at the Thunderfrost Saint Fruit in his hand. The Thunderfrost Saint Fruit suddenly became not that attractive to him anymore.
