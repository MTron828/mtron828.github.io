Chapter 1743 – Swordsman

Hua Hongyu wanted to challenge Yue Weiwei, which made the already heated battle even more exciting. Everyone knew that there was a grudge between Hua Hongyu and Yue Weiwei. The former provoked the latter publicly, and there were rumors that they crossed hands again at the banquet last night.

Anyone with eyes could tell that Hua Hongyu’s reputation as the most beautiful woman in the Heavenly Domain City was worthless before Yue Weiwei’s appearance. They were both considered beauties, but Hua Hongyu had lost to Yue Weiwei in terms of beauty. This was why Hua Hongyu targeted Yue Weiwei; she was jealous.

The opportunity she picked was ingenious. She wasn’t in a hurry to fight Yue Weiwei because she wasn’t confident she could defeat her. But Yue Weiwei had undergone multiple battles, and she wouldn’t have much mental energy left, even if she was strong.

“You can rest if you want. I’m not in a hurry.” Hua Hongyu said indifferently, putting on an act.

“Profound Fairy, you can rest before fighting. As long as you have not lost, you can carry on fighting.” An elder of the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion said.

This made Hua Hongyu lightly furrow her brows as she glanced at the elder, cursing him in her heart. She was only casually saying it, but did not genuinely intend to let Yue Weiwei rest.

Lin Yun wanted to persuade her to come down, but he knew that he wouldn’t be able to let her go if he opened his mouth. Since he had decided to make a clean cut with her, he should be decisive about it. But even so, he couldn’t help feeling heartache.

“Let’s begin.” Yue Weiwei said, and the white ribbons around her danced. When her ten fingers moved, Wind Intent appeared. She also grasped a powerful martial intent. As she played the flute, she emitted a dazzling radiance. She was like an ethereal fairy who came from heaven.

This made Hua Hongyu’s face change because she didn’t expect that Yue Weiwei to still have trump cards after so many rounds. She raised her flute by her lips and started playing it. When a dazzling radiance shone behind her, multiple flowers flew out and soon spread around the Nirvana Stage.

As she stood in the sea of flowers, there was a fiery phoenix dancing amongst the flowers. When Hua Hongyu flew to the sky, she gently tapped her feet on the ground and landed on the phoenix. Simultaneously, her flute music became sacred and ancient.

The soundwaves in the surroundings were like sword auras clashing together. They sounded like metallic clashings, like billowing waves.

On the other hand, Yue Weiwei was slowly lifted into the air by the wind. Under her music, the gentle breeze formed into blades flying towards Hua Hongyu.

Seeing this, Hua Hongyu sneered, and the phoenix wings flapped its wings to block the incoming blades. When the phoenix flapped its wings again, torrential flames swept out, and the flower petals formed into an ocean.

Soaring to the sky, Hua Hongyu stood on the sea of petals, flute music forming billowing waves. As waves rose on the sea of petals, she stood on the wave, and the billowing waves swept over, wanting to devour Yue Weiwei whole. This instantly placed Yue Weiwei in a dangerous position.

Lin Yun shut his eyes, but his hands were clenched and trembling. His heart wasn’t calm. Right then, Yue Weiwei’s music became sharp, and a crimson mark appeared on her forehead with a powerful mental energy sweeping out. Her flute music soon became eerie, with a layer of frost forming on the sea of petals. The entire ocean and Hua Hongyu were sealed in ice in the next second.

But Yue Weiwei didn’t stop there. The nine white ribbons around her manifested into nine serpents that pounced towards Hua Hongyu. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The ice only managed to briefly seal Hua Hongyu before she broke free from the ice. But the nine serpents struck her when Hua Hongyu broke free from the ice. This made Hua Hongyu throw out a mouthful of blood, and the ocean of flowers instantly shattered. When she fell from the sky, the nine serpents were like sharp swords stopping before her just when she wanted to raise her flute to her lips again. If Hua Hongyu dared to make a move, the white serpents would instantly strike her again.

“You lost.” Yue Weiwei said. Her voice was calm, which stunned everyone around the stage.

“I’ve not lost!” Hua Hongyu’s pupils radiated with reluctance, and she wanted to raise the flute to her lips.

But just when she made a move, the nine serpents sent her flying away, and the impact made Hua Hongyu throw out a mouthful of blood. With that, Yue Weiwei defeated Hua Hongyu after several battles, and she nearly eliminated half of the remaining twenty people by herself.

The outcome of this battle surprised everyone because they thought Hua Hongyu would defeat Yue Weiwei after experiencing several battles without any suspense. After all, Hua Hongyu clearly came prepared and probed Yue Weiwei’s strength through the previous battles. But Yue Weiwei easily won the battle, completely suppressing Hua Hongyu.

“Her white ribbons are weird, and you have belittled your enemy. It’s not because you’re weaker than her, so you don’t have to be too bothered about this loss.” Qin Hao comforted Hua Hongyu. His voice wasn’t loud, but it was heard by everyone else. He was signifying this battle wasn’t fair because Yue Weiwei used an external object.

Yue Weiwei manipulated those white ribbons with music, not to mention she fought several battles. So Hua Hongyu should hold the advantage. But she lost, which only meant she was weaker than Yue Weiwei. Then again, no one dared to say anything because of Qin Hao’s identity as a holy land’s genius.

“Yue Weiwei, let me come face you.” An indifferent voice resounded from Qin Hao. This made everyone briefly stunned, with surprise flashing across their pupils. They never expected Qin Hao to lower himself to fight Yue Weiwei, since he was a popular candidate. At the very least, Yue Weiwei shouldn’t be worthy of him making a move when she underwent several battles.

Everyone was briefly stunned before they came to their senses. It was clear that Qin Hao wanted to stand out for Hua Hongyu, and he wanted to teach Yue Weiwei a lesson. When Qin Hao stepped forth, he hovered over the Nirvana Stage.

When massive mental energy swept out, flames appeared behind Qin Hao, and the fire was terrifying and looked like it was alive.

“Not good!” Yan Tianchen furrowed his brows beside Lin Yun, and he could clearly sense Qin Hao wasn’t the same as the other opponents Yue Weiwei faced.

“Weiwei, admit defeat!” Mu Xueling sent a furious look at Lin Yun before roaring at Yue Weiwei.

“Come then.” Yue Weiwei ignored what Mu Xueling said and stared at Qin Hao.

“Let me teach you some rules…” Qin Hao’s face was indifferent, looking arrogant. As he spread his arms apart, his hands emitted a faint radiance. As flames swept out behind him, it formed into an ancient zither before him, and the zither emitted a massive pressure under the fire.

Everything happened too quickly. Before Yue Weiwei came to her senses, zither music resounded with musical notes flying out. The musical notes soon manifested into fireballs that appeared before Yue Weiwei.

This caught her by surprise, and she could only block the incoming attacks with the white ribbons since she didn’t have time to play the flute. But the zither music was too fast, like a violent storm, while Yue Weiwei was a small rift.

Yue Weiwei only briefly lasted with the nine ribbons before a fireball landed on her. Before Yue Weiwei could play the flute, she was already sent flying away. The impact made her throw out a mouthful of blood, and she nearly lost her grip on her flute. This scene made Yan Tianchen anxious, and he couldn’t help getting up on his feet.

“The difference is too great!”

“It’s not because the difference is too great, but mainly because Yue Weiwei has undergone several battles, and she doesn’t have much mental energy left.”

“Isn’t this a little too cruel? Why is the Profound Fairy persevering, then?”

“I don’t know. Qin Hao is too much. She doesn’t even have to admit defeat and just go down the stage to rest. It’s fine if he wants to stand out for his woman, but is there a need to take advantage of her?” Controversy resounded from the surroundings. Not only did Qin Hao take advantage of Yue Weiwei’s condition after several battles, but he didn’t even allow her to play the flute.

It was a one-sided suppression on the Nirvana Stage, but Yue Weiwei gritted her teeth. She was trying to find an opportunity to play the flute.

“Let’s end this now!” Qin Hao coldly snorted, and the flames from the zither swept out. The flames instantly enveloped Yue Weiwei, and the nine serpents were soon incinerated to ashes.

“She’s finished!” Everyone’s faces changed because Qin Hao was a little too much.

Below the stage, Hua Hongyu snickered, and he felt a lot more comfortable. Just then, a torrential outburst of killing intent swept over the Nirvana Stage.

“What’s going on?” Everyone was shocked. They were scared by the killing intent and could feel a chill running down their spines under an immense pressure. When they turned their attention to where the aura came from, they saw Lin Yun opening his eyes with killing intent filling his pupils.

“Qin Hao, you’re courting death!” Lin Yun roared, and he charged towards the Nirvana Stage. He gave up everything that was on his mind just a moment ago. How could he be considered a swordsman if he couldn’t protect his woman? As boundless rage filled his heart, Lin Yun was like a fiend god who came from hell as he charged towards the stage.
