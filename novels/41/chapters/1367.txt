Chapter 1368 - One Step To The Heaven

When Jian Jingtian swung his sword out, a terrifying aura enveloped the entire summit of the fleeting cloud, causing the sun and moon to dim under his sword ray. Jian Jingtian was also using his firmament sword intent and the Lightning Shadow Sword, but it was a hundred times more powerful than when Lin Yun used it.

Most importantly, Jian Jingtian was merely swinging his sword out of rage and didn’t use any martial techniques behind his attack. So this scene made the corner of Lin Yun’s lips twitch with his scalp going numb.

When he was at the quasi-firmament sword intent, he already sensed how terrifying Jian Jingtian’s sword intent was. Back then, he bled from his eyes when he just took a glance at Jian Jingtian’s sword intent because it looked like a bright and majestic sun.

At the same time, all the other Samsara Edict Realm experts had their mouths wide open while looking at this sword unleashed by Jian Jingtian. But in Lin Yun’s impression, he knew that this wasn’t the limit to Jian Jingtian’s sword intent. Was it because Jian Jingtian was under a certain restriction and couldn’t unleash his full power?

As Lin Yun’s eyes flickered, he was puzzled because there were too many secrets shrouding Jian Jingtian. Perhaps his current state wasn’t right because his accumulation in the Dragon Pulse Realm was too terrifying.

As boundless energy poured into the Lightning Shadow Sword, Jian Jingtian began to glow and his black hair began to flutter in the wind violently.

“Was the old geezer always so handsome?” Lin Yun now knew why Feng Jue called Jian Jingtian his junior brother. It turned out that Jian Jingtian wasn’t old at all. In terms of his appearance, even Zhuge Qingyun was inferior to him. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

When Jian Jingtian swung his sword down, all of heaven and earth began to tremble, causing the entire Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect to tremble along. All the restrictions in the sect were activated before they crumbled and disappeared. Only Lin Yun was smart enough to stand near the Sword Saint Mountain, and this wasn’t affected by it at all.

“Profound Sky Canon!” Zhuge Qingyun couldn’t think much right now when he sensed a threat coming from Jian Jingtian. So he immediately pushed the Profound Sky Canon to the limit right away.

As nine lights began to converge on his body, it then manifested into a rainbow armor. As space behind him distorted, the sun and moon revolved in his palm, which instantly caused space to form into a rainbow spatial distortion. This was the move that Zhuge Qingyun used the most, the Universal Reversal.

“This move again!” Feng Jue’s face changed beside Lin Yun as he became nervous. This was the move that defeated the six Samsara Edict Realm experts back then, and this was also the move that instantly defeated him without being able to put up any resistance. Even now, he still hasn't recovered from the injuries that Zhuge Qingyun gave him.

But this only lasted briefly before cracks spread out in the surrounding distorted space. Shortly after, sword rays exploded and caused the cracks to become even wider.

As everything cleared up, space was no longer distorted and Jian Jingtian’s sword landed on Zhuge Qingyun. Along with an explosion, Zhuge Qingyun gritted his teeth as he took this attack head-on with the Profound Sky Armor.

“The Radiant Sword Saint cannot be humiliated!” But Jian Jingtian’s sword was too terrifying with flames still blazing in Jian Jingtian’s eyes.

In the end, Zhuge Qingyun could no longer bear it and his armor began to shatter. When the armor shattered, Zhuge Qingyun had already backed off, but even so, he still suffered a terrifying wound on his chest. Seeing the blood gushing from his chest, Zhuge Qingyun’s face instantly became pale.

“Didn’t you want to show me the difference between us? Why are you still the same as eighteen years ago, pathetic. You can’t even take one sword from me?” Jian Jingtian said, looking at Zhuge Qingyun who had taken a hundred steps back without any expression as he wielded the Lightning Shadow Sword.

As Zhuge Qingyun coughed, his face became uglier, and he threw out several mouthfuls of blood.

“Jian Jingtian, I’m just giving you face! Don’t forget that I’ve not summoned my constellation. You really think that I can’t do anything to you?” Zhuge Qingyun was furious because he thought that summoning his constellation to deal with a Dragon Pulse Realm expert was too humiliating. But he never expected that Jian Jingtian would be so heaven-defyingly strong.

When a painting flew out from his body, the painting unfolded and revealed nine mountains. Each of the mountains was enveloped in profound light that looked like blazing sacred flames. When the constellation unfolded, Zhuge Qingyun’s aura began to rise and instantly overwhelmed Jian Jingtian’s aura in a breath’s time.

As more layers of heaven shattered, Zhuge Qingyun basked in starlight and unleashed all of his aura as a Samsara Edict Realm expert. This scene instantly made the faces of all the Samsara Edict Realm experts from the other powerful sects change.

“Zhuge Qingyun is serious now!”

“He even brought out his constellation! Looks like there’s nothing he can do to Jian Jingtian. Now that he has gone all out, I’m afraid that he won’t hold back anymore, and the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect will be doomed.”

“Looks like this sect will be destroyed!” Everyone’s faces changed and they no longer dared to stay in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect.

“Zhuge Qingyun, stop!” Lin Zhen roared. “If you dare to destroy the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, I swear that I won’t let you go so easily!”

The majority of the elders and disciples of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect still couldn’t retreat in time. If the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect was destroyed, then the accumulation in the sect would all be gone. Most importantly, there would be countless deaths, and those deaths were innocent.

“Damn it!” Su Ziyao and the rest who arrived had their faces changed when they saw this scene. Was the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect really going to be destroyed today?

A brutal light flashed through Zhuge Qingyun’s pupils as he snickered, “What has the annihilation of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect have to do with me? It’s already too late now. Jian Jingtian, kneel and beg me if you’re scared now. Otherwise, I won’t hesitate to go all out!”

Hearing what Zhuge Qingyun said, a cold light flashed through Jian Jingtian’s pupils as he asked, “Are you threatening me with the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect?”

“So what if I am?” Zhuge Qingyun smirked. “Defeating me with a sword? What can you do? I just don’t wish to bully a Dragon Pulse Realm like you. If I’m serious, not to mention the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, but there’s no way you can escape!”

But Jian Jingtian merely wielded the Lightning Shadow Sword and didn’t utter a single word.

“Bring out your constellation if you’re unhappy!” Zhuge Qingyun hovered in the air as his aura crashed down on Jian Jingtian’s aura after being empowered by his constellation. In the blink of an eye, Jian Jingtian’s sword aura could only shrink back to the summit of the snow mountain, looking like a raft in the ocean.

Since Zhuge Qingyun was anxious to take revenge, he reappeared on the summit of the snowy mountain before Jian Jingtian could reply. Then, his palm flew out towards Jian Jingtian’s head. But just when his palm was about to reach Jian Jingtian’s head, Jian Jingtian closed his eyes, as though he had submitted to his fate.

But in the next second, something bizarre happened. All the dragon pulses started pouring into Jian Jingtian’s body. At the same time, Jian Jingtian’s bottleneck in the Dragon Pulse Realm instantly broke and reached the Samsara Edict Realm. But that wasn’t all. As the dragon pulses continued to enter his body, his aura continued to rise, reaching the Profound Life Stage, then the Profound Death Stage, then Nirvana Stage before finally reaching the pinnacle Nirvana Stage.

Just like that, Jian Jingtian had immediately broken through the Dragon Pulse Realm and reached the pinnacle Nirvana Stage under so many people’s eyes. But that wasn’t all. Jian Jingtian’s aura continued to crow, causing everyone’s hearts to throb with their eyes nearly bulging out.

“H-How is this possible?!” Zhuge Qingyun was quickly left dumbfounded by this scene.

Lin Yun’s face changed because he remembered what Lil’ Purple said. Jian Jingtian’s accumulation at the Dragon Pulse Realm was unprecedented. The moment he makes a breakthrough, he would far exceed the limit of the Nirvana Stage. If saints didn’t appear, then he would become an invincible existence.

When Lin Yun turned to look at Lil’ Purple, Lil’ Purple knew what he wanted to ask and nodded her head, “Heavenly King!”

Just like that, Jian Jingtian had taken one step to reach heaven. Even in ancient times, it was rare for anyone to reach Jian Jingtian’s height as a Heavenly King because a Heavenly King was an invincible existence as long as saints weren’t around.

“Zhuge Qingyun, you need to get something clear. I don’t need to bring out my constellation if I want to defeat you,” said Jian Jingtian before he pushed his palm out.

Facing Jian Jingtian’s palm, Zhuge Qingyun threw out a mouthful of blood and his constellation broke into pieces. Under Jian Jingtian’s attack, his bones, internal organs, and meridians were all thrown into chaos.

Just like that, everyone watched as Zhuge Qingyun rolled down the snowy mountain like a snowball. When he reached the foot of the mountain, he was covered in blood, and his hair was scattered around. Without any hesitation, Zhuge Qingyun turned around and fled using both hands and feet.

“I already said that I’ll grant you death if you dare to come to the summit of the fleeting clouds. Since you’ve come, then don’t leave!” Jian Jingtian hovered in the air like a deity, pulling Zhuge Qingyun, who wanted to flee, back to the summit of the mountain.

Before Zhuge Qingyun could respond in time, Jian Jingtian gave him a slap and said, “This slap is to remind you that the Radiant Sword Saint cannot be humiliated!”

Zhuge Qingyun’s cheek instantly became swollen with blood dripping from his lips.

“This sword is to tell you that anyone who dares to humiliate the Radiant Sword Saint will die!” Jian Jingtian then raised the Lightning Shadow Sword and swung it. But just when the sword ray was about to swipe through Zhuge Qingyun’s neck, a golden petal flew over while Zhuge Qingyun was in despair.

As the sword and petal collided, sparks flew out and the trajectory of the sword was shifted. Looking at this scene, Zhuge Qingyun quickly got back on his feet and turned back before he cried out, “Master!”

When everyone heard what Zhuge Qingyun said, their faces changed because Zhuge Qingyun’s master was Tian Xuanzi. So did that mean that Tian Xuanzi had come? Thinking about it, everyone quickly turned in the direction that Zhuge Qingyun had cried out.
