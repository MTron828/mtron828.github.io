Chapter 1050 - I’ve Come As You Wished

Wind Mound City’s plaza was bustling with many geniuses who wanted to witness the Demon Slaughtering Assembly.

Pei Xue was seated next to the Imperial Diagram Realm Son. She was nervously watching the gate. There was no way she could relax since the Nether DIvinity Realm Son sent out six geniuses from the gold ranking, ten generals from the war realms, and dozens of cultivators from the higher realms.

Every single person was beyond ordinary and had treasures gifted by the Realm Sons. Even without the gold ranking geniuses, the sheer number of treasures would make it easy to kill Lin Yun. So with the gold ranking geniuses, suppressing Lin Yun would be a piece of cake.

There was a gigantic pillar in the middle of the plaza that had a red-dressed woman at its base. Her hair was scattered and her body was bound with shackles. Whenever she moved, lightning would flicker on her body.

“Thunder Shackles!” Pei Xue’s face changed as she looked at the shackles on Yue Weiwei. She felt fearful because the shackles had a saint rune that would explode with lightning energy anytime the captive struggled. The lightning would stab into the captive’s body like a venomous viper and torture the captive.

So the more that Yue Weiwei struggled, the more painful it would be for her. The shackles were meant to tear one’s will apart and plant a seed of fear in them. It was an extremely vicious method of torture. Because of the shackles, Yue Weiwei speculated that the Nether Divinity Realm Son had no intention to kill her.

The Nether Divinity, Elysium Trigram, and Profound Dragon Realm Sons were seated at the top of the plaza casually chatting with the guests who came. There were many people gathered in the plaza who were invited by the Realm Sons. Some were seated while others were forced to stand. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“That’s Yue Weiwei? She truly is a beauty in the Heavenly Path. No wonder Lin Yun is willing to come to Wind Mound City for her, but what a pity…”

“The Realm Sons are luring Lin Yun over on purpose. If I were him, I wouldn’t come.”

“There’s nothing he can do. The Nether Divinity Realm Son said that he would strip Yue Weiwei publically if Lin Yun didn’t show up.”

“How brutal.” Discussions sounded out in the plaza, but no one dared to speak loudly. They didn’t want to be heard by the Realm Sons.

Lin Yun was an underdog in the Heavenly Path, and there was a high possibility that he might be able to threaten the Realm Sons if he underwent the baptism of the Saint Spiritual Lake. However, his impatience meant that he had fallen for their trap.

He was still too inexperienced to deal with the schemes of the Realm Sons. Although everyone knew that Lin Yun managed to slaughter his way into the plaza, no one had high hopes for him.

Just moments ago, six geniuses on the gold ranking had left to deal with Lin Yun. Every single one of them emitted an extremely powerful aura. Clearly, they had received many benefits from the Realm Sons. Once again, the foundation of the war realms was on full display.

There were rumors that the war realms had taken the majority of the inheritances in the Heavenly Path. They would also target those who received a great fortune, such as Lin Yun. His Azure Dragon True Bone had drawn the attention of many Realm Sons. Naturally, they would make use of their foundation and promise to encourage others to target Lin Yun.

The Realm Sons sat together as they wore an indifferent expression. The Profound Dragon Realm Son glanced at Yue Weiwei and said, “Isn’t it a little too brutal to use the Thunder Shackles on her?”

After all, not even the Realm Sons could bear the torture of Thunder Shackles. He really couldn’t figure out why the Nether Divinity Realm Son used it on Yue Weiwei. Most importantly, he knew that the Nether Divinity Realm Son wanted to subdue Yue Weiwei. Isn’t he afraid that Yue Weiwei will hate him for using this method?

“The Nether Divinity Realm Son has been kind to her. However, she refused his goodwill. So she only has herself to blame for the cruelty. The Thunder Shackles will make her fear and respect the Nether Divinity Realm Son. Then, the sight of Lin Yun crawling into the plaza will destroy her will,” smiled the Elysium Trigram Realm Son.

“The game has just begun.” The Nether Divinity Realm Son replied calmly with a playful smile. “Just like a stallion needs to be broken, she will ultimately bow before me. If this method doesn’t work, I have a few other ways to make her submit.”

The surroundings became silent as the intention of the Demon Slaughtering Assembly was revealed. The Realm Sons were looking for an excuse to deal with Lin Yun.

“It’s like I thought.” The Imperial Diagram Realm Son smiled while chugging his wine. He turned to look at Pei Xue and said, “This is a trap. There’s no way the Nether Divinity Realm Son will kill Yue Weiwei. Only Lin Yun would fall for this scheme. Then again, no one here would save Yue Weiwei if they were in his position.”

He was naturally talking about the other Realm Sons. Pei Xue was stunned, so she replied, “He’s not supid. He’s just worried that she’ll suffer. It’s really not as complicated as you think it is.”

“Haha, is that so? But what can he even do? Won’t he be forced to kneel anyway?” The Imperial Diagram Realm Son’s eyes flickered as he examined the other Realm Sons. All of them were here to watch the show, but also for Yue Weiwei’s Divine Blood Fruit and Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon True Bone.

If there was a chance, none of them would hesitate to compete for those treasures. However, the six gold ranking geniuses made the first move. Strangely, they were taking a long time to finish up with Lin Yun.

The Nether Divinity Realm Son glanced at Yue Weiwei, who glared at him with hate and disgust in her eyes. He frowned because she was still struggling even at this moment. Let’s see how much you struggle when Lin Yun crawls into the plaza.

As time passed, everyone began to wonder why the six gold ranking geniuses were taking so long. But just as the puzzled thoughts were expressed, a phenomenon appeared in the sky with a towering Azure Firmament Tree. The tree was decorated with Iris Flowers that left everyone dumbfounded. Plus, there was a powerful sky sword intent in the distance.

From far away, everyone could tell how powerful the sword intent was. It was so powerful that a few people lost control of their swords.

“What a powerful sword intent!”

“Is that the legendary sky sword intent? How terrifying!” The outburst of sword intent instantly drew everyone’s attention. Just like that, everyone watched as a sword ray streaked across the horizon.

It was so radiant that everything paled in comparison. Then, the plaza began to tremble as the sword aura swept through all of the surroundings. At the same time, six powerful auras disappeared into thin air.

A terrifying thought began to formulate in everyone’s minds. Did the six gold ranking geniuses lose their lives?

But just when everyone was feeling doubtful, a powerful and sharp sword intent roared over. Without any signs, a ray of light descended onto the plaza. A youth carrying a sword box on his back slowly appeared. At this moment, he emitted a powerful aura that came crashing down on everyone’s hearts.

Everyone could hear a sword hum echo in their ears as they looked at Lin Yun who was shrouded in a powerful aura. This was the aura that he had been building up by slaughtering all the geniuses along the way. Finally, he had reached the peak.

He swept his gaze at Yue Weiwei, who was bound onto the pillar and killing aura began to boil in his pupils. Looking at the Nether Divinity Realm Son, Lin Yun said coldly, “I’m here.”

His blood boiled with anger as he made a promise to kill everyone. If he couldn’t throw the three war realms into chaos, he couldn’t resolve his boiling rage.
