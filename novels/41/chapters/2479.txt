Chapter 2480 - Starry Sky

The Empress pushed a palm out in the Radiant Sword Emperor’s direction, and no one could respond in time because everything happened too quickly.

The Black and White Emperors stepped forward to stand beside Lin Yun. They said, “She’s right. If you want to fight her, you will have to see how powerful she is, and your master isn’t as weak as you think.”

Before Lin Yun could think more about it, the palm already reached the Radiant Sword Emperor.

“Myriad Swords Bell!” The Radiant Sword Emperor formed seals with his hands, and the golden bell in his sword heart began to shine brightly, forming into a bell engraved with divine runes around him. The intertwined threads were like a divine sword blocking the Blade Emperor’s Heart Shattering Form.

The golden palm released by the Empress fell onto the bell. When the soundwave spread out, resonating with heavenly dao. This was a secret technique that derived from Myriad Swords Unite, and this manifested the sword's intent after merging with heavenly dao.

Fine cracks appeared on the golden bell, intertwining that looked like a boat’s keel being damaged. But the bell echoed, forming countless waves on the stage.

“You watch first,” the Black and White Emperors exchanged a look and attacked. They pushed Lin Yun outside the stage, who landed beside the Ice and Abyssal Emperors.

Lin Yun felt helpless because he knew the three were determined to fight with the Empress.

The Radiant Sword Emperor’s blood rumbled, but he knew this was an ordinary palm from the Empress. He smiled, “Empress, I also have a sword for you to experience!”

When he finished, nine swords appeared behind the Radiant Sword Emperor, forming a circle.

“Great Profound Sword Array—Myriad Swords Unite!” The Radiant Sword Emperor soared to the sky, allowing his sword intent to multiply ninefold. The Radiant Sword Emperor’s sword intent already reached the pinnacle ninth-grade, not to mention that he inherited the title of Sword Emperor.

But after his sword intent was multiplied ninefold, the stage looked like an apocalypse as the nine swords scattered out, forming a circle, into a sword array. That was a wall formed with millions of swords, forming into a grand sword array.

The sky cracked as starlight shone down, and everyone now understood why the Radiant inherited the title of Sword Emperor. This was a long story, but everything happened in the blink of an eye.

The Blade Emperor’s face changed, and he muttered, “Nine swords...he only used seven swords to fight me...”

The Flame Emperor replied, “He completed the nine peaks in Sword Sect when he became an Emperor. I have long told you not to underestimate him.”

“Sword Emperor, take a sword from me!” The Radiant Sword Emperor roared and unleashed a sword ray with the flick of his finger. Truth Dao bloomed behind Lin Yun as nine buzzes echoed, releasing a dazzling radiance.

When the sword ray flew out, time and space in the path became chaotic as time slowed while space distorted. This enveloped the Empress in a powerful sword aura. Under the suppression of his sword aura, the aura released by the Empress became dim.

Facing this terrifying sword, the Empress’ face changed. But she had no fear in his eyes and maintained his indifference.

“Imperial Dragon Fist—Myriad Dragons!” The Empress clenched her fist and punched, sending millions of dragons flying out. When the dragons flew out, they left cracks in the barrier of space and time. It looked as though time and space had shattered before she collided with that sword ray.

When the sword and punch collided, the sword array and dragons shattered. When the shattering sound echoed in the Kunlun Mountain Range, the nearby cultivators couldn’t withstand the shockwave and retreated. This was shocking because their attacks left behind fluctuations in time and space, and the Empress’ punch shattered time-space.

“Imperial Dragon Fist—Soaring Dragon Fist!” The Empress threw out a punch to shatter the terrifying sword ray.

Blood dripped from the Radiant Sword Emperor’s lips, his face pale. But the Empress looked at him indifferently, and she didn’t continue to make a move after seeing the Radiant Sword Emperor’s terrible state. She turned around as the Black and White Emperors appeared before her.

When she threw a punch, the White Emperor’s face changed, and he quickly released his phenomenon as a mythical emperor. When their punches collided, the pain nearly made the White Emperor scream.

“Yan Chen, you killed a Demonspirit Clan’s Emperor back then. Why is your punch so weak now?” the White Emperor smiled, shaking his hand. With the White Emperor’s personality, he wouldn’t admit defeat even if his body was crushed.

The Empress didn’t waste time with the White Emperor and threw another punch, shattering time and space. This made the White Emperor grit his teeth and face her head-on.

When the White Emperor charged forward, the flow of time increased, creating a time vortex with his leg clashing with the Empress’s fist. They were so fast that they created multiple afterimages, and the two exchanged over ten-odd moves before the Empress threw another punch to shatter the vortex.

As the time vortex disappeared, the White Emperor took a few steps back. It was painful, but the White Emperor still wore a smile, “Yan Chen, no wonder the Southern Emperor doesn’t like you. You’re no different from a tigress.”

The Empress charged forward once more. Facing the Black Emperor’s attacks trying to intercept her, she would either take them head-on or resolve them casually. However, the Empress only targeted the White Emperor.

This made the White Emperor cry bitterly in her heart, but he held on gritting his teeth. When the White Emperor took another punch, he threw out blood, with cracks appearing on his Golden Emperor Physique. The White Emperor smiled, “Haha! Not enough!”

The Empress ignored him, and his aura underwent a drastic transformation. Her divine dragon’s aura disappeared, replaced with indifferent heavenly dao’s aura. When she threw another punch, the punch caused heavenly dao beyond the thirty-six layers of heaven to rumble, and it was more terrifying than an Emperor’s tribulation. This was the legendary Heavenly Dao Fist!

This punch instantly left a crack in the White Emperor’s phenomenon. His Golden Emperor Physique was on the verge of collapse, and he couldn’t stand firmly on the stage.

Looking at the White Emperor, the Empress said, “Whitey, only your mouth is tough. As one of the Nine Emperors, you’re incredibly weak.”

Lies wouldn’t hurt others, but the truth would. Beaten to this state, the White Emperor could no longer smile and was furious. In the critical moment, the Radiant Sword Emperor arrived, but his injuries were more or less recovered.

The Empress casually avoided a sword as her hair fluttered in the wind, and the Empress took all the incoming attacks with one hand and the other hand behind her. No one could find any other word to describe her other than invincible.

The Empress stabilized and no longer retreated, with her palm landing on the Cauldron Sword. The Cauldron Sword buzzed with sparks flying around, and the Radiant Sword Emperor retreated to a thousand feet before stabilizing himself.

“Together!” The White Emperor caught his breath and roared, charging forward. The Radiant Sword Emperor and Black Emperor also moved as three mythical emperors ganged up on the Empress.

The Black Emperor might’ve lost his status as a mythical emperor, but his strength wasn’t inferior to the White Emperor. More importantly, he could perform the Black-White Divine Canon if they joined forces. When they joined hands, they unleashed an even more powerful aura than the Radiant Sword Emperor, causing phenomena to envelop the entire mountain range.

The world was only left with black and white colors, forming a domain that trapped the Empress.

“Myriad Swords Bell!” The Radiant Sword Emperor attacked as ripples spread out from him. This trump card that defeated the Blade Emperor made the Empress feel somewhat uncomfortable, and she took several attacks because the Black-White Domain caught her by surprise.

But everyone knew that they couldn’t stop the Empress for real.

The Empress roared, “Yin-Yang as heaven!”

An Eternal Dao bloomed behind Liu Wuxie. This flower represented Yin-Yang Dao, and a Yin-Yang Trigram appeared, breaking the Black-White Domain. But that wasn’t all as the Empress roared, “Five Elements as earth!”

Yin-Yang manifested the heaven while the Five Elements manifested the earth. When the two Eternal Daos combined, a powerful aura swept out from the Empress, shattering all the incoming attacks from the three mythical emperors.

But that wasn’t all, as the Empress said coldly, “I am the Sovereign!”

The Empress was like Heavenly Dao, grabbing Yin-Yang and Five Elements in her palm before throwing out a punch, unleashing terrifying, murderous intent.

The three mythical emperors couldn’t take this head-on and threw out a mouthful of blood. They fell onto the ground, rolling. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

This made all the spectators quiet, feeling their scalps numb with fear. That was especially the case for those who previously spoke badly of the Empress, making their faces pale.

The Ice and Abyssal Emperors also had despair on their faces when they sneaked a peek at Lin Yun. The Empress was too strong, not to mention that she didn’t bring out her actual cultivation in the Quasi-Deity Realm. She merely fought with her cultivation in the pinnacle Emperor Realm.

When they thought about that, the Empress gave off a powerful aura, reaching the Quasi-Deity Realm.

The surrounding islands around the stage shattered, and the powerful shockwave drained all the water in the river. But that wasn’t all as the Empress roared, “The Heaven is heartless, and dao is ruthless!”

Clenching her fist, the Empress grabbed the thirty-six layers of heaven within a million miles of radius in her hand, all the secret realms and continents in the thirty-six layers of heaven. All the lives that lived in this region all died.

When the Empress threw out a punch, all the surrounding mountains snapped aside from Mount Tai. A huge hole appeared in the sky, and anyone could see the starry sky as long as they raised their heads. When starlight shone down, it made the Empress look dreamy.

This scene terrified everyone, and many Emperors fell on their knees. They didn’t even dare to look at the Empress head-on.

The Empress turned to look at Lin Yun and said, “Flower Burial, come and fight. Let me see where you get the confidence to deal with the God Burial Mountain Range from!”
