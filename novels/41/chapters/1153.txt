Chapter 1154 - Withering Radiant Snow Flower

The place where the origin stone was born was filled with violent astral energy. Right now, all sorts of explosions, lightning, flames, ice, snow, sword rays, and punches were flying around. The destruction caused by the fight between Ye Ziling and Lei Ying was unimaginable, and the shockwaves were extremely destructive.

Amidst the chaos, Azure Birds covered in purple lightning flew through the air like sharp swords. Even in this desperate situation, Ye Ziling refused to give up. She was giving Xiao Kun and the others a headache. After all, they couldn’t chase after Lin Yun.

Ye Ziling was clearly at a disadvantage, but she still blocked everyone.

As lightning and flames exploded, the elements manifested to various demonic beasts. And the region that Lei Ying was in was a lightning purgatory.

He locked onto Ye Ziling with his astral energy before he emitted a dazzling glow. Then, he pushed his palm out and hundreds of demonic beasts manifested around him to attack Ye Ziling.

When his palm enveloped with lightning and flame collided with Ye Ziling’s sword ray, the astral energy surged out of his body and easily destroyed Ye Ziling’s attack. Having her attack destroyed by a palm, Ye Ziling drifted into the snow flowers that were enveloped with lightning energy and sky sword intent.

After Lei Ying knocked Ye Ziling back, he charged straight into the sea of flowers. Lightning jumped out at him from the flowers that he passed, which made his face turn dark. He was losing count of how many times he had to destroy Ye Ziling’s attacks. THe never ending lightning annoyed him to no end since Ye Ziling continued to evade him.

Although the movement technique of the Radiant Snow Saint Clan, the Divine Lightning Shadow Art, wasn’t hard to deal with, it was powerful when merged with the bloodline of the saint clan. If Lei Ying wasn’t careful, he could lose his life.

But Lei Ying was a bold person. So he decided to barge into Ye Ziling’s territory anyway. When he swept his glance out, he quickly found Ye Ziling whose sword exploded with lightning and iciness. But despite looking heroic, her face was terrifyingly pale.

Although the blood on her lips dried up, it was clear for everyone to see that she was in a terrible state.

“Ye Ziling, as someone who possesses the Radiant Snow Saint Clan’s bloodline, why are you lowering yourself to risk your life for the Fleeting Cloud Sword Saint? You can go anywhere you want with your identity. Are insignificant people really worth your life?” Lei Ying sneered while he looked at Ye Ziling.

“You haven’t won yet!” Ye Ziling raised her head and looked back at Lei Ying indifferently.

“Tsk, tsk, tsk!” Lei Ying was briefly stunned before he began to chuckle, “You know that you’ll die the moment I get serious. I just don’t wish to kill you, offending the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect and Radiant Snow Saint Clan.”

“No. You’re injured. Seriously injured.” Ye Ziling looked at Lei Ying coldly and continued, “Your cloak must be the reason why you were able to kill two Elysium Core Realm experts. But the elders of my Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect aren’t that weak, even if they’re only in the lesser Elysium Core Realm.”

“You!” Lei Ying’s body began to tremble with his killing aura surging.

“Disciples of the demonic cult might seem to have bizarre emotions, but none of them are stupid. You killed Qin Feng because you wanted to intimidate everyone else. You fooled the other demonic cultivators, but you can’t fool me…” Ye Ziling’s indifferent voice continued. “You even dared to betray a powerful sect of the demonic cult, so you’re really afraid of the Radiant Snow Saint Clan and the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect? I know that you can’t fight with your full strength, and you’ll have to pay a great price if you want to bring out your constellation.”

When the other demonic cultivators heard what Ye Ziling said, their backs were covered in a cold sweat as they turned to look at Lei Ying and wondered if what she said was true.

“Tsk, tsk. Looks like I’ve underestimated you!” Lei Ying revealed a weird smile before he continued, “Ye Ziling, you’re really not afraid of death!”

When he was done speaking, a painting slowly opened up behind him. The painting was engraved with an ancient demonic beast. When the painting was done unfolding, the demonic beast pounced forward. It was a Black Demonic Eagle manifested with lightning and flames.

When the demonic eagle let out a sharp cry, terrifying demonic light began to surge around Lei Ying. At this moment, he looked like a demon from hell. With a strange laugh, Lei Ying pushed his palm towards Ye Ziling.

The demonic light around him condensed into a colossal palm that flew towards the blizzard and Ye Ziling’s Azure Birds. Lei Ying wasn’t holding back anymore as he planned to crush Ye Ziling by force.

Facing his attack, Ye Ziling’s blizzard disappeared in a split second. Although the Azure Birds began to revolve and unleashed terrifying sword intent, they didn’t last long under Lei Ying’s attack. When the demonic eagle charged down, her sword aura disappeared.

Then, the eagle collided with Ye Ziling, sending her flying and spitting up blood. Her face paled from the terrifying attack as she knelt on the ground.

Ye Ziling’s consciousness began to blur while Lei Ying gasped for air. His shocking attack made blood drip from his cloak and exhausted him a little.

Lei Ying looked at Ye Ziling, “You want to die? Don’t worry, I won't let you die so easily. I let you experience something even more terrifying than death. Capture her and sell her to the Demon Domain! Let her know the true meaning of despair!”

Clearly, Lei Ying had paid a great price for that attack earlier, causing the rage in his heart to reach its peak.

Xiao Kun was briefly stumped before he recovered from his shock, he immediately nodded his head and approached Ye Ziling along with the other demonic cultivators, “Y-Y-Yes!”

Just when Ye Ziling was about to lose his consciousness entirely, she sensed someone approaching. But she didn’t even have the strength to wield her sword right now due to her heavy injuries. The current her couldn’t even kill herself if she wanted, not to mention resisting.

But just when her consciousness was about to turn black, she heard flute music playing from the distance with rage and violence. Lin Yun combined his noble tune and sky sword intent with the Divine Indigo Bamboo Jade Flute.

The heads of the demonic cultivators that were approaching Ye Ziling exploded. In the next second, numerous headless corpses fell to the ground. Although Xiao Kun barely managed to break free from the music with a punch, he still took several steps back to stabilize himself. “Who is it?!”

But no one replied to him as the music continued. Then, an azure dragon collided with Xiao Kun, covering him in wounds while he rolled over the ground.

When Xiao Kun raised his head, he could see a silver figure descending from the sky holding onto a jade flute. With a silver luster of moonlight, it looked like an immortal was descending into the mortal realm.

“Flower Burial…w-why is he here…” Ye Ziling could only see a blurred figure, but she was extremely familiar with the sound of Lin Yun’s flute. There were many people who could play the flute in the world, but there was only one Flower Burial. She struggled to open her eyes, but there was nothing she could do as her consciousness gradually faded away.

Am I going to die here…? Just when Ye Ziling’s consciousness began to blur, she felt no pain or regret. She merely felt sorry. Silver light shined in the darkness, but she could no longer see the world. At this moment, she was only a withering Radiant Snow Flower.Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com
