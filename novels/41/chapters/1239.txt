Chapter 1240 - Look At my Lips

Seeing the heat blazing in Lin Yun’s eyes, Lil’ Purple waved her hand and the painting rolled shut. When the painting closed, the scenery disappeared.

Lin Yun still didn’t have enough of it and said, “It’ll be tough for me to gather a constellation of that level, right?”

“It might be hard for others, but not for you. After all, you can observe the painting any time you want.” Lil’ Purple waved her hand and the painting flew to Lin Yun. She continued, “As long as you have enough divine astral pellets, you’ll be able to form the constellation any time you want. Furthermore, you’ve cultivated the Iris Sword Sutra, so it’ll be easy for you to form the constellation.”

That simple? Although it was strange, it made sense since Lin Yun was the Iris Sword Saint’s heir. It would make no sense if he couldn’t form the constellation, especially since he had a painting to refer to. Thinking about it, a fire blazed in Lin Yun’s heart as he chuckled, “How many divine astral pellets do I need? I’m not lacking in divine astral pellets.”

After all, he took about 100,000 divine astral pellets from the ten war realms, and was left with about 20,000 divine astral pellets. Plus, if he sold the few hundred-rune saint artifacts that he obtained from the Sword Assembly, it wouldn’t be hard to get another hundred or two hundred thousand divine astral pellets.

Two hundred thousand divine astral pellets was an astronomical sum, and Lin Yun dared to bet that no sect master in the Profound Azure Prefecture could take out such a sum. That amount might not even be seen if an entire sect pooled all of their resources together.

Even monstrous geniuses of the Ancient Barren Domain would have difficulty taking out 100,000 divine astral pellets.

“Not a lot. The Iris Sword Saint spent about five million divine astral pellets. If it’s you, I guess two to three million will be enough. If you really don’t have enough resources, you can choose not to copy it completely. However, its power will be weakened if you do that,” said Lil’ Purple.

“Get lost!” The smile on Lin Yun’s face became stiff when he heard that. How was two million not a lot? Even the saint clans wouldn’t spend that many divine astral pellets to nurture their direct descendants.

“Hehe, it’s really not a lot. Back then, it was common to see people spend over ten million divine astral pellets to form their constellation. Well, it was a lot easier to create the divine astral pellets in the past too.” Lil’ Purple soon locked her brows together.

At least two to five million divine astral pellets to perfect the constellation… Just thinking about it made Lin Yun’s face turn pale.

“Hey, are you alright?” Lil’ Purple quickly ran over and supported Lin Yun before she smiled, “Then let’s not go with the Iris Sword Saint’s constellation. You can return the painting and figure one out yourself.”

“No.” Lin Yun tightened his grip on the painting and shook his head, “L-Let me think of a solution.”

Five million divine astral pellets was a little intense.

“Aside from creating your constellation, you can also raise your sword intent to the divine firmament sword intent or practice your flute,” said Lil’ Purple. “Once you entered the threshold of wielding the flute as a sword, you were ready to start practicing the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Cannon.”

When Lin Yun thought about it, those two options were easier than gathering more divine astral pellets. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Will it really be that strong now that I’ve entered the threshold of wielding the flute as a sword?” Lin Yun asked. Now that he had grasped the noble tune, the power of his flute was already so terrifying.

“It’ll be at least ten times stronger. It’ll far exceed your imagination, but this will have a high requirement on your skill and sword intent,” said Lil’ Purple seriously.

The current Lin Yun was already strong, but he still wanted to prepare a few trump cards before heading for the Profound Wither Island. The Azure Dragon Saint Physique and Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords weren’t enough for him to sweep through all his competitors, so he had to grasp the two other methods that Lil’ Purple talked about.

Otherwise, someone else would end up stealing his key, and he couldn’t accept that outcome.

“Let’s go out first. I have to talk to the old geezer about the Sovereign Divine Rune hidden in the Sword Saint Mountain. I also have other matters to ask the old geezer about,” said Lin Yun while he inwardly sighed and gazed at the Iris Secret Realm. It was such a pity that a holy land of this scale was reduced to the barren land before him.

In the blink of an eye, half a month had passed. During this period, Lin Yun either visited Luo Hua or improved his strength. Most of the time, he was in his residence refining the divine dragon aura and comprehending the divine firmament sword intent. Occasionally, he would also practice the flute under Lil’ Purple’s guidance.

He didn’t have to care about anything else because it was absolutely safe in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. It was an especially precious time because he would eventually leave the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect when the year was up and he would never have such a peaceful time ever again.

At the same time, he didn’t dare to neglect his cultivation because he knew that he would have to face violent storms after leaving this safe haven.

On this day, another crack appeared on the sword cocoon on his forehead. This time, the golden-yellow aura that flowed out had far exceeded the two previous times. As Lin Yun touched his forehead, his purple mark got hot and emitted a bewitching aura.

“This is the third time,” muttered Lin Yun. He was getting close to obtaining the divine firmament sword intent, but it was still a little too slow. At the same time, he still didn’t know where he was lacking, and he wasn’t the type who would just sit and wait.

“Looks like I still have to pay the old geezer a visit,” smiled Lin Yun as he jumped off of the stage. Suddenly, he threw a punch out as his vitality burned, turning into a golden mist that poured out of his pores.

Lin Yun tried it again, and this time 400 dragon runes appeared on his fist as he clenched his right hand. As Lin Yun emitted a terrifying power, he threw his punch out. Although this punch didn’t seem heavy, the power of this punch could tear an entire mountain apart.

When Lin Yun landed on the ground, he took a deep breath while a satisfied look appeared on his face. He had more or less refined the divine dragon aura that he had absorbed. He would probably have 500 dragon runes once he finished refining the last divine dragon aura.

The purple-golden dragon runes had two colors - purple for lightning and gold for wind. With the two combined, he would be able to grasp thunderstorm intent. Naturally, his power would reach a terrifying height like this.

“If I cultivate my physique to the limit, I might be able to reach the limit of dao. This means that all three thousand daos end up in the same place, and each dao can bring you to the end of the path,” muttered Lin Yun to himself.

He speculated that there must definitely be those who only relied on their physique to become saints or even emperors, and it wouldn’t be any inferior to sword dao. But even if he went on that path, it was impossible for him to compete with those who specialized in their physique. This meant that he still had to cultivate his sword and physique together.

Now that he was done, he planned on paying Jian Jingtian a visit. The old geezer might not seem friendly, but Lin Yun knew that he definitely had a lot hidden. After all, he was ranked first on the three rankings, and Lin Yun would be stupid not to seek the old man for advice.

An hour later, Lin Yun found Jian Jingtian who was cultivating with his eyes closed on the main mountain. If one didn’t notice carefully, they would think that he was sleeping. But when Lin Yun poured his sword intent into his pupils, he could see the radiance that Jian Jingtian was emitting.

This scene baffled Lin Yun because Jian Jingtian’s sword intent had left his body. But how was that possible? Jian Jingtian was seated there, but his sword intent was like a soul flying around. This made Lin Yun curious about what would happen if he cut the connection between the sword intent and Jian Jingtian.

“Your thoughts are dangerous,” said Jian Jingtian as he looked at Lin Yun coldly, instantly shattering the sword aura that Lin Yun released. Simultaneously, stinging pain filled Lin Yun’s mind.

Realizing that his thoughts were revealed, Lin Yun squeezed out a smile, “Old geezer, don’t think too much about it. I’m here to drink with you.”

As he spoke, he took out two bottles of Dragon Clan wine out of his interspatial pouch and walked forward. But Jian Jingtian merely swept a glance at him and coldly smiled, “Speak, what do you want?”

“Nothing. I’m only here to drink with you. You really think too much, no wonder your temper is so foul that even your daughter doesn’t like you,” said Lin Yun while he poured wine.

“You’ve been here for six months, and the times you looked for me can be counted on one hand. Speak, what request do you have? I’ll definitely help you to the best of my ability,” said Jian Jingtian.

Hearing that made Lin Yun’s eyes light up, “Well, I do need a little help from you. But I’m mainly here to drink with you.”

Jian Jingtian wore a mocking smile and snickered, “I know what you wanted the moment you move your tail. Don’t bother putting on an act before me.”

“I’d like to borrow some divine astral pellets,” smiled Lin Yun.

Jian Jingtian smiled seeing that Lin Yun was only here to ask for divine astral pellets. He drank the cup of wine and smiled, “It’s about time for you to reach the Astral Stage, so you need divine astral pellets. So? How many do you need?”

“Not a lot, just five million,” smiled Lin Yun.

Hearing that nearly made Jian Jingtian spit out the wine.

“Read my lips.” He then looked at Lin Yun like he was looking like an idiot before he mouthed the words ‘get lost’.
