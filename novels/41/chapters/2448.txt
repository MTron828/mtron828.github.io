Chapter 2449 - Empress' Rage

It turned out that Tian Xuanzi was a painting!

Lin Yun was shocked as a hand reached for the painting and flew over. The painting looked like the Southern Emperor, which surprised Lin Yun because it was the Southern Emperor.

This was because when he drew his sword in the Azure Sky Realm, the Southern Emperor’s remnant had appeared, which was the first time he had seen the Southern Emperor’s appearance. He also had an outstanding and flawless appearance like Tian Xuanzi, but that was only a remnant will, and he couldn’t take a clear look.

Most importantly, the Southern Emperor had black hair, while Tian Xuanzi’s hair was golden. This was the reason why Lin Yun never linked them together. But thinking about it again, Tian Xuanzi shared an uncanny resemblance with the Southern Emperor aside from his hair.

A bright moon shining in the sky as the broken bridge is filled with water and snow. No one knows that my heart is like the moon, and who mocks who for being in the painting!

Lin Yun recalled the poem Yu Qingfeng recited when he saw Tian Xuanzi in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. This meant that Yu Qingfeng already knew of Tian Xuanzi’s identity, but it wasn’t convenient for him to reveal it directly. But this was too bleak for Tian Xuanzi.

The peerless genius in the eyes of everyone, the strongest beneath the Emperor Realm, turned out to be a painting.

What is going on? The Great Saints from the Profound Sky Sect’s faction were dumbfounded, with disbelief in their eyes. But when they came to their senses, their faces changed and they quickly soared to the sky, wanting to leave this place.

But those from the Sword Sect couldn’t be bothered with them. Looking at the painting, Ye Guhan’s questions were all resolved.

On the Golden-Purple Dragon Throne, the white cat stared at the painting in a daze before leaping down and running towards Ye Guhan. The latter naturally knew this cat, and he reached out, allowing the cat to jump into his embrace.

The cat opened its mouth, and a golden jade slip appeared, making Ye Guhan squint. That was the new martial technique after combining the Profound Sky Canon and Great Profound Sword Canon. But it wasn’t complete, so Ye Guhan had to finish it himself. It turned out that Tian Xuanzi had arranged everything and was prepared to die.

Lin Yun carried the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron and descended to the ground, placing the cauldron on the stage, which caused the entire Scarlet Firmament Peak to tremble. He quickened his footsteps and said with a complicated gaze, “Earlier, when Tian Xuanzi fought me, he was seeking death on purpose. He didn’t go all out with me, which must be because of you.”

When they fought earlier, Lin Yun couldn’t determine the right time and didn’t have enough trump cards. This was why he couldn’t find the opportunity. If Tian Xuanzi dragged the battle out, he would lose the fight after Tian Xuanzi got used to the Firmament Saint Cloth.

But Tian Xuanzi told him about his flaw: telling Lin Yun that he would go all out. Because Tian Xuanzi would go all out, Lin Yun placed his bet that Tian Xuanzi would reveal his true self and took the risk of recalling the Firmament Saint Cloth.

The outcome was as he had expected. But he didn’t expect Tian Xuanzi to lie and spare him. If that last palm landed on him, even the Divine Dragon Sovereign Physique might not have been able to withstand it, and it was unsure if he could survive the blow. He could only put that on Tian Xuanzi and Ye Guhan’s relationship.

“Are you blaming yourself for it?” Ye Guhan looked at Lin Yun and said, “There’s no need to blame yourself. He might have been under someone's order but he still harmed the Sword Sect. He’s the reason why the Sword Sect is almost destroyed. He’s a pitiful person, but he’s also a hateful one. Even if you didn’t make a move, I would have still killed him myself.”

Lin Yun sighed, “I never regret killing anyone who died by my sword, but I only felt that my victory wasn’t fair.”

Ye Guhan said, “Let’s not talk about that now. The three holy lands have left, and now is the critical moment for our master’s tribulation. The Empress won’t give up so easily.”

“Master’s tribulation? What’s going on now?” Lin Yun looked at the depths of the Sword Sect with concern in his eyes. There was a terrifying aura from that direction that even those who were pinnacle Great Saints didn’t dare to intrude. With his current cultivation, he couldn’t tell what was happening.

“His heart. Our master has to sever the heart demon, which is why he's extracting the Sword Sect’s saint vein to resist the tribulation. This is also the critical moment,” Ye Guhan said with a grave expression.

Lin Yun’s face changed, before he said, “Senior Brother is worried that an Emperor might interfere?”

Nodding his head, Ye Guhan said, “Tian Xuanzi was the best chess piece to ensure the rules weren’t broken. But Tian Xuanzi is gone now, so we can’t be sure that the Empress won’t disregard the rules.”

The Azure Python Great Saint came and coldly said, “Let her come, if she dares. She might be the strongest, but that doesn’t mean she can kill all the Emperors in the world. Our Azure Dragon’s lineage also has an emperor here. As long as Flower Burial is willing to become the Azure Dragon Lord, the Azure Dragon’s lineage will be at your command, and that emperor will also listen to you.”

The moment he said that, everyone from the Sword Sect became excited.

The Divine Phoenix Holy Master looked at Lin Yun, and said, “The Divine Phoenix Mountain’s Emperor is also here. If the Empress disregards the rules, we do not need to fear her.”

Mister Ghost looked at Lin Yun and said, “Lady An is currently accepting the Demon Emperor’s legacy. She will rule the Demon Gate in the future and can also help you.”

Lin Yun asked, “How is An Liuyan now?”

“Accepting the Demon Emperor’s inheritance is a painful process. In the future, there won’t be An Liuyan, only the lord of the Demon Gate. But before the ceremony, her only condition was hoping that the Demon Gate could help the Radiant Sword Saint’s tribulation,” Mister Ghost said.

Lin Yun’s heart sank, knowing he owed An Liuyan a lot.

Su Ziyao stepped forth, asking, “You’ve sworn to reforge the Heavenly Path. If you reach that step, the Sacred Alliance won’t stand and watch.”

“There’s something that I have to tell everyone,” Lin Yun said, looking at everyone. He continued, “Yu Qingfeng promised that he would also appear, if needed.”

Everyone became excited upon hearing that. After all, Yu Qingfeng was a myth, one of the nine Emperors. Although those from the Sword Sect had already guessed that Yu Qingfeng was their backing, they finally felt relieved after hearing a confirmation from Lin Yun.

The various forces had Emperor Realm experts, but they didn’t have any mythical emperors. Since Yu Qingfeng was willing to make a move, the situation was different now.

Lin Yun looked at Mu Xuankong, and said, “Sect Master, what about this? Disperse everyone else in the Sword Sect, and I’ll stay at Scarlet Firmament Peak to protect the saint vein. Even if an Emperor makes a move, no one can harm me as long as I hide beneath the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron.”

“This is the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron left behind by the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity?” The Azure Python Great Saint asked with his eyes shining brightly.

They were deeply shocked when everyone heard what he said because everyone knew the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity’s story.

“Yeah, this is the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron he left behind. With this cauldron, the Sword Sect might be able to become a holy land as long as we can make it through this ordeal,” Lin Yun said. The Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron had countless inheritances that the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity’s lineage had been using. It was more than enough to make the Sword Sect a holy land.

“Alright, we’ll listen to Flower Burial’s arrangement,” Mu Xuankong smiled. Through this battle, his form of address toward Lin Yun changed, and everyone began to make arrangements.

Lin Yun circulated the sword sutras, drawing the shattered Firmament Saint Cloth over from the surroundings. The Firmament Saint Cloth might have been destroyed, but he dispersed it on his own accord. Thus, repairing it would also be easy.

At the same time, Tian Xuanzi’s painting flew to the Divine Dragon Empire. The Empress sat on her throne as she waved her hand and summoned the painting over.

On the golden clouds, the Blade Emperor, Lightning Emperor, Black Emperor, White Emperor, and Flame Emperor were present. They had observed the entire battle in the Sword Sect.

The Empress coldly said, “Tian Xuanzi, that traitor! I shouldn’t have depended on and nurtured a painting for years. A painting slave had his own thoughts without my permission and sought death!”

Whenever she said a word, heaven and earth would tremble, and lightning flashed in the sky. But none of the other emperors spoke as they wore complicated expressions. They already knew that Tian Xuanzi was someone the Empress painted with the Southern Emperor as a model, and everyone felt sympathy for Tian Xuanzi.

Tian Xuanzi hadn’t known his identity for a long time and was infatuated with the Empress. Even after knowing his identity, he still followed the Empress's orders.

He and Ye Guhan were friends who could give their backs to each other, not to mention that the Radiant Sword Saint treated him well. But even so, he willingly became the Empress’ chess piece.

The White Emperor and Black Emperor were together. The White Emperor transmitted his voice over to the Black Emperor, “Blacky, is she pretending to be furious, or is she really outraged? As the saying goes, one would grow affectionate to a dog after being kept for a long time, not to mention a person. He might have been a painting, but he was drawn with the Southern Emperor’s blood and she wasted the Heavenly Dao’s power to create him. It’s impossible for her to feel anything. Tian Xuanzi is pitiful to seek death, and I would do the same if I was in his position. Blacky, why aren’t you saying anything?”

The Black Emperor, who didn’t transmit his voice, said, “You’re the one courting death. Your voice transmission skill hasn’t improved over the years. Do you think that no one else heard that?”

The White Emperor was stumped before he raised his head to look at the Empress’ murderous gaze. He awkwardly smiled, “I’m just joking.”

The Empress indifferently said, “Let the old fogies of the three holy lands make a move. If Yu Qingfeng makes a move, I will stop him personally, and I won’t put up with him any longer.”
