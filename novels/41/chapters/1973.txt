Chapter 1974 - Heartache

Bai Shuying was briefly stunned, seemingly wondering why the intruder saved her. But when she regained her senses, she roared, “Let go of me!”

Lin Yun awkwardly smiled and immediately let go of Bai Shuying. But when he let go of her, the pool water surged from both sides, creating a powerful undercurrent at the bottom of the pool, and the momentum brought Bai Shuying back to Lin Yun.

This time, Bai Shuying bumped into Lin Yun’s embrace, and he could clearly sense the softness before her chest. Before Bai Shuying could flare up, they fell because Lin Yun couldn’t stand any longer, and they were brought to the bottom of the pool by the powerful momentum, creating a powerful vortex at the bottom of the lake.

The vortex swept Lin Yun and Bai Shuying as they began to spiral. This caught them by surprise, and they couldn’t get away from each other. On the contrary, they stuck closer to each other instead.

Lin Yun gave it a try, but couldn’t use his cultivation under the boundless saint aura within the pool.

“Get lost!” Bai Shuying’s face finally changed.

This gave Lin Yun no choice but to forcibly shove Bai Shuying away. But when he pushed with both his hands, he kneaded onto something soft with his hands, and his face instantly changed beneath the mask.

“Let go!” Bai Shuying roared.

“Y-Yeah. I’ll let go…” Lin Yun awkwardly removed his hands. But the moment he let go, the vortex stuck them together again, creating an awkward situation between them. Just like that, they were carried by the momentum.

When the vortex finally settled down, Lin Yun took advantage of this moment and soared to the sky like a blade.

When Bai Shuying was finally free, she quickly took a robe from her interspatial bracelet. But the robe couldn’t bear the high temperature at the bottom of the pool, and the saint runes began to melt.

Bai Shuying couldn’t be bothered about that and gritted her teeth, “You want to leave? Dream on!”

When Lin Yun soared out of the Celestial Pool, he stowed his wings and carried the sword box as he flew down. This instantly attracted the attention of all the deacons guarding outside, and they looked at Lin Yun with shock. They couldn’t figure out how this person came in, leaving them with huge question marks on their foreheads.

“So there’s really a mosquito.” Bai Xiao smiled with his eyes squinted and stepped forth, charging at Lin Yun.

A fatal threat soon approached Lin Yun. When they fought, Lin Yun discovered that an actual Quasi-Saint was much stronger than the Silvermoon Alpha Wolf. In just one exchange, Lin Yun was sent flying away.

“Keep him alive!” Bai Shuying flew out from the Celestial Pool, enveloped in saint radiance.

“Alright,” Bai Xiao said. He had already probed Lin Yun’s strength from his last attack, so he descended back to the ground and ordered, “Capture him!”

He was confident that his palm could severely injure Lin Yun, and it was more than enough for the ten deacons to capture him.

But Lin Yun took a tree branch and used it as his sword. Thirteen figures flew out from him and started drawing circles that overlapped with fireflies. Lin Yun’s attack was slowly grounding down the attack from Bai Xiao, and Lin Yun’s sword aura slowly absorbed it.

Lin Yun thrust his sword three circles later, surprising the incoming deacons. The deacons were sent flying back and collided with the surrounding rocks. Lin Yun dissolved Bai Xiao’s saint aura and turned it into his before releasing it towards the incoming deacons.

“Myriad Swords Unite?” Bai Xiao was dumbfounded with disbelief within his pupils when he saw this scene. How did this person manage to do it when he was clearly only at the Nirvana Stage?

Saint radiance burst out from the surroundings as multiple Quasi-Saints approached. Lin Yun knew that he was in trouble. The security around the Celestial Pool increased after several rounds of intrusion. It was fine if he didn’t cause any commotion, but it would be hard for him to leave now after causing a commotion.

In just a brief moment, eight Quasi-Saints surrounded Lin Yun. A Quasi-Saint roared, “Who the hell are you?! How dare you intrude on the Celestial Pool!”

He wanted to make a move, but Bai Shuying stopped him and said, “Hold on. I have something to ask him.”

Bai Shuying then coldly said, “Remove your mask and let me see who you are!”

“Take off your mask!” A few Quasi-Saints roared with murderous intent flashing within their pupils. Their faces were ugly because someone actually intruded on the Celestial Pool even though they were guarding it. This was no different from slapping their faces.

Bai Xiao was still all right because he already sensed something earlier, but he couldn’t intrude on the Celestial Pool since it was a forbidden ground. He was also curious about who this person was beneath the mask, and he had a feeling this person was a saint disciple of the Heavenly Dao Sect.

Lin Yun bitterly smiled beneath his mask; he had already expected this scene. Since he intruded on the forbidden ground, he could be discovered. But he never expected that Bai Shuying would be at the Celestial Pool's bottom. He also never expected that they would have such close contact at the bottom of the Celestial Pool.

If that didn’t happen, Lin Yun wouldn’t mind removing his mask. He was a Great Saint’s secluded disciple, and he wouldn’t be killed. It would be easy to resolve this matter when the Dragon Origin Great Saint returned. But now, he even intended to use his trump cards to escape. After that, he could just deny it since he was wearing the mask.

“If you take off your mask, I’ll spare you, no matter who you are!” Bai Shuying gritted her teeth.

But Lin Yun smiled bitterly and replied, “I might be able to live if I don’t remove my mask. You’ll probably be the first to take my life if I do.”

“It’s not up to you!” Bai Xiao smiled and suddenly made a move, appearing before Lin Yun.

Although Lin Yun sensed his movement with his Azure Dragon Sword Heart, it was already too late, and he could only fall backwards. This made Bai Xiao surprised because he failed. But he was faster and pushed his palm forth at Lin Yun’s chest before rapidly removing his mask.

When Lin Yun took three steps back, he fell onto one knee, and his true appearance appeared before everyone. When they saw his face, everyone was shocked with disbelief in their pupils. This was because everyone recognized this person.

“Ye Qingtian!” Bai Shuying exclaimed as she took a step forth. Not only her, but the other Quasi-Saints were also shocked.

No one expected that Ye Qingtian would be so bold as to intrude on the Celestial Pool again. Bai Xiao was also surprised as he held onto the Silvermoon Mask and looked at Lin Yun.

After having his mask removed, Lin Yun no longer dwelled on it. He tied his hair and smiled, “Brother Bai, do you mind returning the mask to me?”

Bai Xiao awkwardly smiled and handed the Silvermoon Mask back to Lin Yun, secretly giving him a thumbs up.

Lin Yun took the mask before looking at Bai Shuying with a smile, “See? I said that you’ll probably be the first person wanting to take my life if I remove my mask.”

“You’re right,” Bai Shuying said coldly. She ordered, “Kill him.”

“What?” Bai Xiao was shocked before he awkwardly smiled, “Shuying, there’s no need to take it that far.”

The other Quasi-Saints also fell into a dilemma. After all, Ye Qingtian was the secluded disciple of the Dragon Origin Great Saint, and his position within the sect was higher than theirs. But they couldn’t refuse the holy maiden’s order either.

“I said, kill him.” Bai Shuying repeated with her face becoming even colder.

Right then, the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint descended from the sky and relieved everyone before they cupped their hands together. “We pay our respects to the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint.”Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint looked at Lin Yun and mocked, “Your master really taught a good disciple!”

“Remember what I told you? Quick!” Lil’ Purple transmitted her voice from the Iris Secret Realm.

This made Lin Yun’s face briefly change before he made up his mind and secretly said to the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint, “Mistress, there’s a long story. So please help me resolve this crisis first.”

When the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint heard Lin Yun call her ‘Mistress,’ her face changed, and the surrounding temperature plummeted. No one knew what had happened, and they had fear on their faces. The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint roared, “Ye Qingtian, who gave you the guts!”

Lin Yun instantly knew he was doomed. But before he could react, the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint pushed her palm forth with a powerful saint radiance released from her.

When she gave off her pressure, all the Quasi-Saints fell onto their knees with their souls trembling under the terrifying saint radiance.

This scene also made Bai Shuying anxious. She wanted to kill Ye Qingtian but couldn’t help feeling heartache when she saw this scene. She began to recall how Ye Qingtian risked his life to block the pool water for her earlier and how he took a one-sided beating when he could retaliate. This instantly made her doubt if she had misunderstood him. Was that the action of a lecher?

For some reason, Bai Shuying felt heartache. She had never experienced this before, and she turned to look at her master, “Master, no…”

But before she could open her mouth, the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint already made a move. Her palm landed on Lin Yun, causing the latter to lose his consciousness and leaving everyone in the surroundings trembling in fear.
