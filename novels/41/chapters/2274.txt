Chapter 2275 - Bow To The Blood Moon Sect!

“The Heavenly Wheel Pagoda!” When the Heavenly Sage Saint Lord, Crow Shot Saint Lord, and Indigo Brave Saint Lord raised their heads to look at the pagoda in the sky, their scalps became numb as their faces changed. The Heavenly Wheel Pagoda was giving off a powerful aura before it started to descend, forcing all the Saint Lords who were underneath it to be sent flying away.

“Quick, we have to stop the pagoda!” The Heavenly Sage Saint Lord’s face changed as he poured his saint energy into the cauldron. When some ancient runes appeared on the cauldron, a sun and a moon appeared, giving off the powerful aura of a Sovereign Saint Artifact before it charged out.

The cauldron was like a lofty mountain that bore the pressure from the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda. The power of the Sovereign Saint Artifact was spreading as the cauldron flew over.

The Ming Cult’s saint elders and their subsidiary forces band together, not daring to run. This was because even Saints were helpless before the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda’s time-space energy.

“Immortal Indigo Moon!”

“Eternal Heavenly Flames!” The Crow Shot Saint Lord and Indigo Brave Saint Lord brought out their secret techniques, activating their Sovereign Saint Artifacts as well.

A powerful aura swept out from them, especially the Crow Shot Saint Lord, who had lightning converging into an indigo moon that rose above his head.

But that wasn’t all; there was a pair of lightning wings behind him with many ancient runes engraved on them. In this split second, his aura became terrifying as he fully displayed the powerful foundation of a holy land’s Saint. He held the golden axe with one hand, looking like a deity, before he threw it.

When the golden axe flew out, a terrifying aura swept out that shattered the space that was in its path. The lightning on the axe was becoming even more terrifying with every rumble.

Compared to that, the commotion caused by the Indigo Brave Saint Lord was smaller. He only swiped his fingers and ignored the heavenly flame in the blade. Once the heavenly flame and the blade combined, he unleashed a blade ray that had reached over a thousand feet as it soared toward the sky.

But shortly after, the blade ray manifested into a humanoid figure, charging at the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda. The three Saint Lords stood together with their auras combined.

The Heavenly Sage Saint Lord said with a grave expression, “The Heavenly Wheel Pagoda might be terrifying, but it might not be that powerful in the hands of a little girl.”

The Indigo Brave Saint Lord and Crow Shot Saint Lord’s eyes flickered, instantly understanding what the Heavenly Sage Saint Lord meant.

The Crow Shot Saint Lord said, “That’s right. We might be able to snatch the divine flame fragment from her. If she shows weakness, we might even be able to snatch the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda.”

The Indigo Brave Saint Lord said, “Don’t be careless. That’s the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda that we’re talking about!”

The Heavenly Dao Sect might have been split apart, but it used to be the strongest holy land in Eastern Desolation. Aside from the Heavenly Sword and Dao Sword, they also had the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda.

The time-space treasure was also considered a Sovereign Saint Artifact. But it was on a completely different level from other Sovereign Saint Artifacts. The only reason that they had a chance of winning was because Wang Mayan might not be familiar with it since she was too young. In other words, she couldn’t bring out the full power of the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda.

“What the Indigo Brave Saint Lord said is right,” the Heavenly Sage Saint Lord looked around, then whispered, “If we really can’t block it, we will retreat with our core men.”

The Indigo Brave Saint Lord and Crow Shot Saint Lord fell into silence. This was a cruel decision. But with a Sovereign Saint Artifact, they could leave even if they couldn’t fight the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda. Even so, it was another story of how many people they could bring with them. They naturally couldn’t care about the other forces and might even have to sacrifice some saint elders from their sect.

“But if she can’t hold on, we can take this opportunity to take her down. After all, the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda contains many resources from the Heavenly Dao Sect,” a hint of ferocity flashed across the Heavenly Sage Saint Lord’s eyes as he coldly looked at Wang Mayan.

When the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda appeared, Wang Mayan easily broke free from the encirclement and soared to the sky, joining the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda. As a radiance shone from her, her hair fluttered, making her look sacred.

“Ye Qingtian…” Wang Mayan’s gaze fell onto Lin Yun below, who was treating the Astral River Saint Lord’s injuries.

When they bumped gazes, Lin Yun soon shifted his eyes away, unwilling to take another look at her, and focused on treating the Astral River Saint Lord’s injuries.

Ye Qingtian, you’re unwilling to take another look at me? Wang Muyan’s smile froze on her face as bitterness rose in her heart. She inflicted heavy injuries on the Astral River Saint Lord and snatched the divine flame fragment, then broke free from the three holy lands’ encirclement. But she had no smile on her face despite her achievements at this moment.

“Senior, your injuries might take some time to recover,” Lin Yun said. The Astral River Saint Lord’s injuries were special, and he didn’t dare to go all out, even with the blue dragon aura. This was because if he accidentally broke the Astral River Saint Lord's seal, his cultivation might return to a Saint Sovereign.

Within the Heavenly Void, if your cultivation reached a certain height, it would draw the God Burial Mountain Range’s attention and would be killed by the lingering aura of the deities.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

The Astral River Saint Lord bitterly smiled, “I know my situation well. For a Saint Sovereign like me to fall for a little girl’s trick…”

“That’s the Thousand-Faced Demonic Art,” Lin Yun said.

“The Thousand-Face Demonic Art?” Everyone looked baffled as Lin Yun briefly explained the Thousand-Face Demonic Art. This mental technique would cast an illusion on others even though Wang Mayan’s face had never changed. As a result, everyone would see a different face when they looked at her.

Lin Yun knew that Wang Mayan had relied on this demonic technique in the past to make many men fall for her beauty. But he didn’t expect that Wang Muyan could also use it to disguise herself.

“That damned demoness!” Ji Zixi gritted her teeth.

The Divine Phoenix Mirror hovered above everyone’s heads to resist the power of the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda. With the Astral River Saint Lord injured, Ji Zixi didn’t dare to carelessly make a move. Unlike others, she had feelings for those from the Divine Phoenix Mountain and their subsidiary forces. She didn’t dare to carelessly put those people in danger.

“The divine flame fragment is a pity.” The Astral River Saint Lord had reluctance on his face as he looked at Ji Zixi with guilt. He continued, “I am guilty for ruining something that the Lord instructed.”

Ji Zixi said, “Uncle Xinghe, don’t put it that way. My father would hope for your safety. We can find another divine flame fragment again in the future.”

“The possibility is low.” The Astral River Saint Lord shook his head. He knew how tough it was to obtain a divine flame fragment.

“Where’s Qu Wushuang?” Lin Yun asked. The Divine Dao Pacilipn was one of the six holy lands, and Qu Wushuang’s attitude was friendly. There was a high possibility that they also brought a Sovereign Saint Artifact here, which could be of help.

“He has long fled,” Li Febai said furiously. “I have been watching him, and he left with the Divine Dao Pavilion when everyone took out their Sovereign Saint Artifacts.”

“He’s a smart person,” Lin Yun smiled.

“You still have the luxury of time to smile?” Li Feibai glared at Lin Yun.

“Why don’t we leave as well? Lin Yun, you can come with us,” Ji Zixi said.

Lin Yun was surprised to hear that since he could tell that the Divine Phoenix Mountain needed the divine flame fragment for a reason, unlike the other holy lands. They even risked letting a Saint Sovereign enter, meaning they must have a plan. But he didn’t expect Ji Zixi to be willing to give up now.

“You really want to leave?” Lin Yun asked.

Before Ji Zixi could reply, Li Feibai smiled, “Of course not. But she can’t bear to have you die here and wants to protect you with the Divine Phoenix Mirror.”

Lin Yun was stumped upon hearing that and looked at Ji Zixi.

Ji Zixi blushed, and said, “The divine flame fragment might be important, but there’s no need to risk our lives for it. Do you want to leave with us?”

Lin Yun shook his head, “It’s not that simple. Where do you think the Ying River King and Zhao Tianyu are located?”

Everyone was briefly stunned because they had neglected those two after they left.

“Furthermore, who says we have no chance of retrieving the divine flame fragment?” Lin Yun raised his head and looked at Wang Muyan. Everyone here could leave except for him, and who said that he didn’t have a trump card?

While everyone was talking amongst themselves, the three Sovereign Saint Artifacts were clashing with the descending Heavenly Wheel Pagoda. The entire Flame Dragon Valley began to collapse when they clashed, creating an apocalyptic scene.

“We’ve managed to stop it!” The Heavenly Sage Saint Lord rejoiced at this scene. The three Sovereign Saint Artifacts not only managed to stop the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda, but they also managed to send it back.

“She’s too young!” The Crow Shot Saint Lord sneered as he flapped his wings, soaring to the sky and grabbing the golden axe that flew out. The Heavenly Sage Saint Lord disappeared, before raising the cauldron and slamming it against the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda. The Indigo Brave Saint Lord then swung the blade in his hand.

They knew that they had to take this opportunity to suppress the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda, even if Wang Muyan showed a weakness on purpose. To show weakness on purpose in a battle of this scale was the same as playing with fire.

“You three still dare to come?” Wang Muyan’s hair was like a waterfall, draping over her shoulders as they fluttered in the wind. Her voice sounded charming and could bewitch anyone.

“Why wouldn’t we dare?” The Heavenly Sage Saint Lord sneered. “We have experienced countless lives and deaths to become Saints, so which of us will be afraid of a trap that you set up?”

“The Heavenly Wheel Pagoda is a time-space treasure. It’s not something that a little girl like you can completely control. So you can’t fool us,” the Crow Shot Saint Lord sneered.

“Hahaha! I’m afraid that you guys will have to be disappointed!” Wang Muyan laughed. “Everyone in the Eastern Desolation only knows that the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda belonged to the Heavenly Dao Sect, but no one knows that the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda is a treasure that belonged to the Blood Moon Sect in the first place! When the crimson moon enveloped the entire Eastern Desolation, you were just subsidiaries to the Blood Moon Sect!”
