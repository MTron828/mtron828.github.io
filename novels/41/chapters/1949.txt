Chapter 1950 - Teaching On Behalf Of Master

Lin Yun revealed expectation within his pupils upon hearing what Ye Guhan said. Was he finally going to teach him how to cultivate the Sword Heart? He had a lot of questions about the Sword Heart.

The Azure Dragon Sword Heart seemed strong, but the difference wasn’t that great. It didn’t seem to have any other usage besides an increased sense of danger and seeing through the loopholes of attacks. Then again, these two effects were strong enough because Lin Yun relied on them often when fighting.

“Junior Brother, release your Astral Sword Intent and let me see,” Ye Guhan said. “Your sword sea seems weird, and I can faintly sense that you’ve grasped the Astral Sword Intent. But I can’t sense anything else.”

Lin Yun wasn’t surprised because not even a Great Saint couldn’t see through him.

With a thought, his forehead shone, and he released his Astral Sword Intent. This instantly enveloped him in sword rays, his hair fluttering violently with a terrifying sword aura spreading out.

“You’ve already reached lesser mastery?” Ye Guhan was surprised. He wasn’t surprised that Lin Yun grasped the Astral Sword Intent. After all, this junior disciple was greatly loved by their master, meaning Lin Yun’s sword talent must be extraordinary. In addition to his intentional guidance during their previous meeting, it shouldn’t be a problem for Lin Yun to achieve the Astral Sword Intent if he had any opportunities.

But to Ye Guhan’s estimation, Lin Yun should’ve just reached the Astral Sword Intent, not lesser mastery. One must know that it wasn’t easy to cultivate the Astral Sword Intent.

“I’m just lucky.” Lin Yun smiled and shared his experience on the Celestial Purging Mountain.

“It’s better this way,” Ye Guhan smiled. “I even prepared some Sword Emperor Herbs to refine into the Sword Emperor Pellet for you. But it looks like I can save on them now.”

“What? No, I still need them. It’s too hard to cultivate the Astral Sword Intent, and I spent half a year in the Three-Lives Realm but made no progress,” Lin Yun immediately said. Without the Heavenly Cloud Fruits, he barely progressed in his sword intent.

“Haha, it’s futile,” Ye Guhan smiled. “You can use external items to aid you before the lesser mastery, but it’s too hard after reaching the lesser mastery. You’ll need something even more powerful. You can release your sword intent now.”

As the two sat down, Ye Guhan said, “Before teaching you how to cultivate your Sword Heart, I’ll teach you a secret technique to cultivate your Astral Sword Intent. This is the ultimate technique of our master’s lineage, and I’ll teach you on behalf of our master. You can’t teach it to others unless they also enter our lineage.”

“Okay,” Lin Yun nodded.

“This secret technique is called the Myriad Astral Celestial Art. When cultivating this technique, you can use your star as a sword and absorb astral energy to temper your star…” Ye Guhan sat down and tapped on Lin Yun’s forehead with boundless information pouring into the latter’s mind.

Lin Yun quickly shut his eyes to digest the information. Half a stick of incense later, he opened his eyes after digesting the Myriad Astral Celestial Art.

“I’ll guide you in your first time as it’ll be dangerous by yourself. But you can only rely on yourself in the future,” Ye Guhan said. “Come, form a seal together with me.”

Lin Yun nodded and sat down with his hands changing. As they both released their sword intents, multiple swords appeared behind Ye Guhan, igniting a few thousand golden stars.

On the contrary, Lin Yun only had one star, and it was insignificant in comparison.

“Let’s go!” Ye Guhan laughed.

Before Lin Yun could respond, the few thousand stars carried his star and flew out, instantly breaking through the thirty-six layers of heaven and coming to a majestic universe. He could see thousands of constellations and the majestic sun and moon. Taking a few glances, his star became unstable, and his sight began to narrow to a few thousand miles of radius.

But Ye Guhan took care of Lin Yun as the stars coiled around his star, repelling the primal chaos in the surroundings and even releasing starlight on Lin Yun’s star.

“Don’t panic. Now, try and release your sword soul,” Ye Guhan said, and Lin Yun’s heart gradually calmed down.

Lin Yun gave it several attempts and circulated the Myriad Astral Celestial Art, but he couldn’t release his sword soul no matter how he tried, naturally making him anxious. He began to wonder if he was too stupid.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

At the same time, he discovered that his vision was beginning to narrow, which plunged him into fear. His senior brother illuminated the stars he saw, while his star was insignificant in the grand universe. Before the grand universe, his star might fade any moment now, and this really scared Lin Yun. He feared that his Astral Sword Intent might disappear in the next moment.

“Don’t be afraid. I’ll illuminate for you, and the universe is beautiful.” A peal of laughter resounded as Ye Guhan’s sword soul appeared. This was a golden sword soul with a candle and a saint rune engraved on it.

When the candle blazed, Lin Yun’s vision recovered. Although it was only a hundred feet in radius, Lin Yun felt warmth when the light shone onto him, and his emotions stabilized.

“There’s no need to hurry. Even if you fail, your Astral Sword Intent won’t disappear,” the golden human smiled.

This made Lin Yun relieved, and he began to attempt. Although he kept failing, Ye Guhan was patient.

Lin Yun’s sword soul suddenly appeared a few hundred attempts later, and a golden human appeared on his star. At this moment, Lin Yun could finally see Ye Guhan’s figure, which felt like a colossal mountain. He yelled, “I’ve succeeded!”

But he didn’t notice that there was an even more majestic figure behind Ye Guhan.

“What’s that?” Lin Yun looked at the candle in Ye Guhan’s palm. He could feel that this candle was extraordinary and shone brightly as the engraved saint rune blazed.

“This is…” Ye Guhan briefly paused and smiled, “A treasure left behind by our master, the Deity Luring Candle. It’s refined with divine blood. Back when our master taught me, he also used the Deity Luring Candle, which symbolizes that the inheritance of our lineage will continue. Alright, recollect yourself and focus. Our master is looking at us down below.”

“What?” Lin Yun exclaimed.

“I’m not lying,” Ye Guhan smiled. “Our master can sense it the moment the Deity Luring Candle ignites. After all, it also contains his heart’s blood, aside from divine blood.”

Lin Yun’s face changed, and he looked down, wanting to see through the thirty-six layers of heaven to find his master in the Sword Sect.

Back in the Sword Sect, an old man was looking at the sky, and a candle was before him. Blood melted down instead of wax as the candle flickered in the wind. His lifespan was reaching an end, but his will was stronger as he warmly looked at the sky.

The old man smiled, allowing the wind to blow as he tapped his finger on the candle, “My life hasn’t come to an end yet!”

“Focus.” Ye Guhan tapped on the golden human’s head, which was painful to Lin Yun.

“Ouch!” The golden human rubbed his head before focusing on cultivating, looking adorable.

This couldn’t help make Ye Guhan smile, and he recited the Myriad Astral Celestial Art. Suddenly, the candle's light shone brightly, radiating to myriad miles.

Lin Yun’s vision also opened up, and he could see many stars.

Meanwhile, Ye Guhan fell into deep thoughts, and his smile disappeared when he lowered his head. Since Lin Yun was focused on his cultivation, he naturally overlooked this scene.

Two days later, Lin Yun’s star turned into a miniature sword and descended like a waterfall. When the star returned to his sword sea, Lin Yun was surprised to discover that his star had grown by a small ring, and this naturally brought joy to his pupils when he opened his eyes.

Although there was only a small improvement, it was equivalent to six months of cultivation. Most importantly, Lin Yun had just started and still significantly improved in the Myriad Astral Celestial Art.

“How does it feel?” Ye Guhan smiled.

“Strong!” Lin Yun nodded his head.

“This is just the beginning, and Sword Heart’s cultivation technique is also hidden in the Myriad Astral Celestial Art,” Ye Guhan smiled.

“Oh?” Lin Yun was curious because he didn’t notice it.

When he wanted to ask about it, Ye Guhan said, “There’s no need to hurry. I’ll bring you somewhere.”

The two soared to the sky and reached a few thousand miles away in the blink of an eye. This mountain range was a demonic beast forest of the Heavenly Dao Sect.

“Wait for me.” After placing Lin Yun on the summit, Ye Guhan stepped out.

“Here you go.” When Ye Guhan returned, he was accompanied by a powerful gale that made Lin Yun narrow his pupils to stabilize himself. He then gave Lin Yun a crimson fruit.

When Lin Yun ate this fruit, he could sense his blood boiling, and his cultivation had risen. This saint fruit must be over five thousand years of age, at the very least.

“How is it?”

“It’s sweet.” This saint fruit was pretty good, and it didn’t take long for him to be left with the seed. But when he wanted to put the seed down, Ye Guhan slapped his hand, and the seed entered his mouth. As Lin Yun gulped down, he asked, “Senior Brother?”

Ye Guhan smiled, “Junior Brother, this is the Blood Rune Fruit, and there’s a Quasi-Saint demonic beast in this territory. He waited a few hundred years to consume this fruit and allow his bloodline to transform. Speaking of which, can you sense its rage?”

Lin Yun’s face changed when he heard that because he realized he was fooled.

“Go and play with it. If you can last through the night, your Sword Heart is more or less accomplished.”

“Senior Brother, you…” Before Lin Yun could finish, Ye Guhan lifted him and threw him out. When Lin Yun landed on the ground, he was right before the den of that Quasi-Saint demonic beast.
