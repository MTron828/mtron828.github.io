The cave was already cold, to begin with. But when the eyes appeared, the temperature in the surroundings immediately dropped. Lin Yun was still fine because he practiced a dragon clan’s body-refining technique, and his vitality was majestic, like an abyss.

The dark space was like a cauldron, and he could feel the blood pumping in his heart. This instantly enveloped him in a terrifying chill, and he could feel a chill down his spine. But the whole place suddenly became dark, and they couldn’t see or hear anything besides their hearts pumping.

Lin Yun poured his sword intent into his pupils, and what he saw made him feel a chill down his spine. He locked his brows together and held his breath, not daring to make a move. This was his first time seeing a Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpse. But right then, Lin Yun could sense a soft and warm body leaning against him.

Sensing the warmth on his body, that body leaned even closer, especially the peaks of her chest that were nearly sticking onto his back. At the same time, An Liuyan’s face was pale, and her lips were purple. “I’m a little cold.”

Lin Yun inwardly sighed because there was nothing he could do, even if he knew that she was doing this on purpose. He carefully retreated, wanting to put some distance against this creature. But the owner of those crimson eyes was fixed on him, and it was slowly approaching them.

While grabbing onto the Flower Burial Sword, Lin Yun could sense that his palm was covered in sweat and his brows were locked together. This was the first time he had run into such a troublesome situation.

Suddenly, the owner of those crimson eyes pounced over, and it disappeared when it got within a hundred meters.

Lin Yun instantly felt a threat enveloping him, and he swung his sword without hesitation. As sparks flew, a black sword appeared before him, emitting a terrifying yin aura. But fortunately, Lin Yun was keen, or that sword would have stabbed into his heart. Regardless of whether the Azure Dragon Saint Art could withstand this sword, Lin Yun had a feeling that he would be in danger if he was struck.

Just when Lin Yun’s thoughts flashed, one sword after another quickly enveloped him. He didn’t hesitate to activate the dragon runes on his body, and they formed into a hundred-foot azure dragon.

The Azure Dragon was vivid. It was covered in scales, and the claws were enveloped in wind and lightning. After summoning the Azure Dragon, Lin Yun’s defenses weakened since he didn’t have the dragon runes’ protection.

But he couldn’t think about that right now. Even if he had the dragon runes protecting him, Lin Yun wasn’t willing to face the attacks of these demonic corpses. So he could only place his hopes on the azure dragon to protect him.

As countless sword rays flashed, the azure dragon protected him the whole time. Once he suddenly broke through the siege, the azure dragon immediately disintegrated and returned to Lin Yun in the form of dragon runes.

“Come back!” Lin Yun’s hands joined together, and he stretched out. The sword box stuck in the crack in the wall flew back and returned to his hand. After he retrieved the sword box, a pair of golden wings unfolded behind him.

Carrying An Liuyan on his back, Lin Yun placed his hands on the sword box and quickly escaped. But even so, there were still a few pairs of crimson eyes directed at him, and he couldn’t shake them off no matter how hard he tried.

An Liuyan reached out and threw out several ice-attributed flames. The power of those flames was terrifying, and they should be a form of saint flames because they transformed into spears. But when the spears landed on the Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpses, the fire immediately dissipated. None of An Liuyan’s attacks were effective against them.

“How can this be? Are these ghosts?” An Liuyan could feel her scalp going numb, which was the first time she had run into this situation.

“I don’t think so!” Lin Yun put An Liuyan down with a chill flashing through his pupils. The relentless pursuit was starting to make him feel a little annoyed. Since he couldn’t get rid of them, he might as well kill them. Lin Yun didn’t believe that there were any ghosts in the world.

So he decided to face them head-on, wanting to kill these four ominous creatures with absolute power. If he wanted to kill these demonic corpses, he would have to find their actual bodies, and Lin Yun didn’t think that these demonic corpses were ghosts.

As a constellation unfolded behind him, the Aurora Dragon appeared, and Lin Yun’s aura began to rise. Golden flames blazed within his pupils, and he could see through all the illusions in the world; they were the Aurora Dragon Pupils.

Lin Yun considered this divine ability a taboo, but he could see four transparent humanoid figures in the air. Those figures were filled with liquid and had black flames in their hearts. Those flames were similar to the other demonic corpses that Lin Yun had seen in the other ancient ruins.

But they were much more intelligent and mysterious than those demonic corpses. But that wasn’t the main point, Lin Yun had finally found them!

In the eyes of An Liuyan, she could only see four pairs of crimson eyes charging at Lin Yun, but Lin Yun remained motionless, with his eyes flickering with golden flames and sweat dripping down from his forehead.

An Liuyan’s face changed, and she wanted to step forth. But she was shoved away by Lin Yun. When a painting unfolded behind Lin Yun, the flames in his pupils gradually faded. After the Aurora Dragon Painting appeared behind him, he could feel his blood boiling, and his pupils were filled with ferocity.

At this moment, it was as though he had turned into a primordial demonic beast, with his ferocity reaching a terrifying height. His terrifying aura continued to grow, and the crimson light was like blazing flames.

Not long later, the crimson light on Lin Yun’s body began to blaze like a dazzling sun before he summoned his second painting, the Qiongqi Painting.

“This is… a sovereign constellation?” An Liuyan’s heart skipped a beat when she saw this scene. Seeing Lin Yun’s temperament, she was reminded of certain geniuses in the Ancient Saint Clans and Holy Lands. She had only had a brief glimpse of them, and their aura was shocking, even when she saw them from afar.

Now, that kind of aura had appeared once more, and it was coming from Lin Yun. Before she could come to her senses, Lin Yun stepped forth and clenched his fists together before throwing four punches at those Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpses.

Along with a series of loud explosions, the four demonic flames were forced to retreat as blood began to drip into the eyes of those four pairs of crimson pupils. Then, four rotten corpses appeared, and they were all emitting a disgusting and eerie aura.

The demonic aura was too terrifying, so Lin Yun quickly retreated with An Liuyan. Once he was far enough away, he threw out a mouthful of blood. The crimson flames in his pupils and his constellations returned to his body.

“Lin Yun, are you alright?” An Liuyan quickly asked.

Lin Yun’s face was pale as he shoved a Profound Wither Pellet into his mouth. This was a saint elixir, also known as the pellet of rejuvenation. But it couldn’t recover all of his vitality.

“I’m afraid that you will have to carry me now.” Lin Yun smiled bitterly while refining the saint pellet. His current state was terrifying, blood was dripping down from his pupils. Even a fool could tell he was in a weakened state.

At this moment, Lin Yun finally knew why no one could enter the Dragon Burial Valley, and why everyone was so afraid of the Dragon-Blooded Demonic Corpses. They were indeed too bizarre, and he had to bring out his trump cards to just barely take on the four demonic corpses.

What happened next was, naturally, An Liuyan carrying Lin Yun as she ran. While Lin Yun refined the saint pellet along the way, his exhausted vitality and astral energy were gradually replenished, and his face became rosy.

“What do you think of those demonic corpses?” Lin Yun asked after recovering briefly.

“Perhaps it has something to do with the abyssal fiends in the chaotic era. This might not be the first time this astral realm has been discovered…” An Liuyan said after a brief pondering.

“Abyssal fiends?” Lin Yun asked in a surprised tone.

“Yeah. They’re taboo and only recorded in ancient books in the Ancient Saint Clans. But everyone knows that although the chaotic era was calmed, the threat of the abyssal fiends is still around. Their traces can be found in many forbidden zones…” An Liuyan shared her speculation, before she continued, “I’m guessing that this astral realm has probably existed since ancient times. But it was destroyed by the abyssal fiends, so they’re sealed it till now.”

Shouldn’t the Ancient Saint Clans be the only ones to know about the abyssal fiends? But why did An Liuyan also know about it? Did this mean that An Liuyan was also from an Ancient Saint Clan?

While listening to An Liuyan’s explanation, she had seemingly, inadvertently, revealed her identity. But he wasn’t too bothered about it because he already had his speculations long ago. It wasn’t weird for members of the Ancient Saint Clans to join the demonic sects as long as they weren’t under the jurisdiction of the Divine Dragon Empire; the Eastern Desolation was much larger than the Ancient Barren Domain.

“What is this place?” An Liuyan suddenly stopped, and she looked surprised. What appeared before them were multiple palaces, and those palaces were enveloped in dragon aura, appearing to have once been the home of divine dragons.

This place was enveloped in a dazzling light that made them feel as if they had gone back in time, leaving them both shocked.
