Chapter 979 - Golden Crow Enneaform

No one could believe that Lin Yun won. After all, Feng Xuanyi was one of the seven heads on the Azure Dragon Ranking who stood at the top of the Azure Dragon Region. Every single person knew his name as it had already appeared on the Heavenly Path Mirror. Even the strength that he showed today was greater than anyone could have imagined.

The seven heads were invincible existences, so they could only be defeated by another one of the seven heads. So how did Lin Yun manage to do it when he wasn’t even on the ranking?

Perhaps Feng Xuanyi still had trump cards to use, but he ultimately gave the Glorysun Constellation Palace’s inheritance to Lin Yun. Technically, it was with the help of Lil’ Red, but it was still Lin Yun’s victory.

Watching Feng Xuanyi leave, Lin Yun let out a sigh of relief as boundless exhaustion overwhelmed his senses. His entire world spun as his injuries started to worsen. However, he managed to stabilize himself after spitting up blood.

His face paled after throwing up, but his clarity had returned. A feeling of comfort filled his body as the battle was tremendous for his growth. With a smile on his pale face, Lin Yun roared in excitement, “That felt great!”

The battle was great for Lin Yun because he was pushed to his limit, but he didn’t reveal any trump cards. The fact that he was able to preserve two of his trump cards had given him a thorough understanding of his current strength. Then again, it wouldn’t have been possible without Lil’ Red.

After spitting up more blood, Lin Yun’s complexion began to improve. When Lin Yun turned to look at Lil’ Red, he saw that Lil’ Red was also vomiting blood. Then, the two brothers looked at each other with smiles. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“I’ll go look at the inheritances in the Glorysun Constellation Palace. You can wait here for me.” Lin Yun rested briefly before leaving Lil’ Red behind with the Divine Firebird beast core and bloodline. It was time for Lil’ Red’s strength to improve. Otherwise, Lil’ Red wouldn’t be able to bring out its full strength and the Heavenly Demonic Dipper Staff would go to waste.

When Lil’ Red looked at the beast core and bloodline, its eyes instantly lit up. It could sense that the beast core and bloodline contained a trace of the Golden Crow’s bloodline. These treasures were practically a guaranteed boost in strength.

Looking at Lil’ Red with a smile, Lin Yun headed towards the valley. The path that he was supposed to take was in ruins after his battle with Feng Xuanyi. The only unharmed area was the valley and it was unharmed because it was protected by a certain restriction. As Lin Yun stepped into the valley, he saw the seven corpses again.

Luckily for him, he was strong enough to resist Feng Xuanyi. Otherwise, he would be another corpse on the ground. An individuals’ strength and courage was extremely important to grab hold of the opportunities in the Heavenly Path.

Sweeping his gaze out, Lin Yun looked at the mat with the eight paintings in the surroundings. Lin Yun felt relieved that Feng Xuanyi didn’t take the paintings with him. Otherwise, he would have ended up with an incomplete inheritance.

“Let’s go and take a look,” muttered Lin Yun. As he sat on the mat, he could feel the statue looking at him from different directions. Then, he looked at the eight paintings. Although the paintings weren’t open, he could guess that they were similar to his.

Tapping his interspatial pouch, the last painting flew out of Lin Yun’s hand. With nine paintings gathered, the hidden array was activated. Suddenly, all nine paintings unfolded at the same time.

The nine paintings were divided into eyes, wings, and feathers to form the complete Golden Crow. At the same time, golden runes with fire appeared on the mat beneath Lin Yun. As the nine paintings continued to circulate, the Golden Crow looked like it was alive. But before Lin Yun could react, the Golden Crow charged at him. In the next second, Lin Yun found himself on the back of a massive Golden Crow.

“What is this?” Lin Yun was shocked. He had a feeling that he was in an illusion or a secret realm. When he lowered his head to look at his interspatial pouch again, he was shocked to realize that he could retrieve his items from his interspatial pouch.

Right at this moment, a golden brilliance enveloped the entire starry sky with golden flames. The dazzling brilliance made Lin Yun shut his eyes. When he opened his eyes again, his mouth was wide open with disbelief because there was a sun in front of him.

Then, the golden crow dove into the sun in the blink of an eye. Within the sun, Lin Yun saw all sorts of demonic beasts and legendary herbs. When the Golden Crow took him further into the sun, it put him down on a stage with an entire clan of Golden Crows around him.

“Unbelievable…” Lin Yun looked around with disbelief. He was sure that this place wasn’t the real sun or else he would have been incinerated. However, he could circulate his origin energy smoothly.

Lin Yun could tell that his surroundings had dense astral energy. When he absorbed it into his body, the quality exceeded the divine astral pellets. Then again, it made sense because he was in the depths of this sun.

Lin Yun calmed down because he knew that he couldn’t stay here for long. He was certain that he was in the Great Sun Realm of the Glorysun Constellation Palace’s inheritance. The name Great Sun Realm was made up by him because he didn’t know where he was. But there was no question that this was an unprecedented treasured land that could allow his cultivation to soar.

Squinting his eyes and looking at the Golden Crows around him, Lin Yun figured out how to make use of this place. His cultivation would increase as he breathed, so he didn’t need to stabilize his foundation. In fact, his astral energy would temper his body and aura oceans.

He knew that he could try cultivating the Ten Profound Steps because he would be able to achieve twice the efficiency with half the effort. When he fought with Feng Xuanyi previously, he noticed that Feng Xuanyi’s movement technique was extremely quick. Feng Xuanyi must have a greater fortune martial technique. Fortunately for Lin Yun, the Ten Profound Steps was an imperial fortune martial technique and part of the Sunchasing Art.

In terms of grades, it was higher than Feng Xuanyi’s movement technique. If he was successful in cultivating it, he wouldn’t have a glaring weakness anymore. The Ten Profound Steps corresponded with Golden Crow’s nine transformations, so it could also be called the Golden Crow Nine Transformations. It required him to be in the second soul Heavenly Soul Realm. In the past, Lin Yun didn’t dare to cultivate it because his cultivation was too low. But now, it was a great opportunity.

Lin Yun could easily reach initial mastery in the Ten Profound Steps movement technique. As for lesser mastery, he might have some difficulty since it required high comprehension skills.

After reaching greater mastery, one would have to observe a Golden Crow painting and comprehend the profundities in it. As for pinnacle mastery, one would have to form the Golden Crow seal containing the dao rhyme of the Golden Crow.

Lin Yun was focused on cultivating the Golden Crow Nine Transformation, which was even harder than cultivating the Divine Glorysun Fist. Fortunately, this place was excellent for him. Every time he opened his eyes, he would see vivid Golden Crows and engrave their dao rhyme in his heart.

While Lin Yun was comprehending in the Glorysun Constellation Palace, the other Seven Constellation Palaces were wrapping up. The Glorygold Constellation Palace was taken by the mysterious Pei Xue, the Gloryfire Constellation Palace was obtained by Jun Mengchen and Qin Lin, and the other constellation palaces were also taken by the seven heads. The Glorymoon Constellation Palace was the only one with an unexpected outcome because it wasn’t taken by the seven heads.

No one had expected the Glorymoon Constellation Palace’s inheritance to fall into the hands of another person from the Profound Amber Realm. Yu Haotian was rejoicing because the inheritances of the Divine Glorymoon Fist matched the inheritance well.

“Lin Yun’s Divine Glorysun Fist seems to be a monarch fortune martial technique as well. If I combine it with my Divine Glorymoon Fist…” He had a feeling that he would obtain a martial technique that far exceeded a fortune martial technique.

Yu Haotian’s eyes flickered before he smiled coldly, “Just you wait. No matter what opportunities you have, they will become mine! I’m the real seed of the Profound Amber Realm!”
