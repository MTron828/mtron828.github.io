Chapter 1605 - You Can Have It Back!

Lu Chen’s voice wasn’t loud, but the commotion caused was startling because his voice rumbled like thunder. This shocked many people within a hundred miles, wondering who was bold enough to provoke the Myriad Beast Gate and even Lu Chen.

After all, everyone in the Ancient Barren Battlefield knew that the Myriad Beast Gate had already submitted to the Profound Sky Sect, and no one dared to provoke them. In that split second, countless people swiftly flew over when they heard the commotion.

“I go by the surname Lin, and my name is Yun. Since the Myriad Beast Gate has submitted to the Profound Sky Sect, you guys shouldn’t be unfamiliar with my name, right?” Lin Yun smiled. When he was done, he took a deep breath before blowing out, sweeping away all the dust on him, revealing his actual appearance.

“It’s you!” Lu Chen exclaimed as he stood behind the nine golden light rays.

“Lin Yun!”

“The Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple, Lin Yun!”

“Flower Burial?” All the Myriad Beast Gate’s disciples were briefly stumped before their faces became ugly. After all, wasn’t Lin Yun a little too bold? He confronted Qin Tian outside the Ancient Barren Battlefield and dared to provoke them. He was only at the second-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. Was he tired of living?

“Senior Brother, kill him! Take revenge for me!” Liu Feng screamed, covering her eyes.

“Senior Brother, please deal with him!” The Myriad Beast Gate’s disciples that were previously sent flying away looked at Lin Yun with flames of rage blazing in their pupils. If they could’ve killed Lin Yun, they would’ve already slaughtered him thousands of times.

“Interesting. You guys make it sound like I’m a demon, but weren’t you the ones who wanted to dig my eyes out first?” Lin Yun said indifferently. Judging from these people’s appearances, this would only make others misunderstand that he was bullying the Myriad Beast Gate.

But Lin Yun soon wore a smile. So what if he was bullying the Myriad Beast Gate? No matter what, the Golden Lotus was his!

“Who the hell do you think you are? You only learned some secret techniques by relying on your identity as the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple. With your cultivation, you’re no different from an ant in our eyes!”

“Do you really think that the old geezer can make a breakthrough? The Ancient Barren Domain should’ve changed a long time ago!”

“The Ancient Barren Domain has no spot for the Radiant Sword Saint!” The Myriad Beast Gate’s disciples looked at Lin Yun coldly, with disdain reflected in their pupils.

Standing on the cliff, Lu Chen smiled, “Lin Yun, since you dare to provoke my Myriad Beast Gate alone, I’ll be taking your head, then! I believe Young Master Qin Tian will be happy!”

“Senior Brother, don’t kill him so easily. Let him suffer worse than death!” Liu Feng said with hatred filled in her voice.

“You want my head? I’m afraid that you guys will be disappointed!” Lin Yun grinned with a cold light flashing in his pupils. When Liu Feng sensed his killing intent, her face changed, and the other disciples wanted to stop him. But it was too late. They were too slow. Lin Yun swiftly crushed Liu Feng’s skull. Two of the Myriad Beast Gate’s disciples who rushed over to help took a slap to their faces and were sent flying away.

The two could feel their eardrums buzzing. They couldn’t comprehend what happened. Even though they were at the third-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, they were like children before Lin Yun. This was too shocking.

Not only were the Myriad Beast Gate’s disciples shocked, so was everyone else. They still thought Lin Yun was too bold, but they were instantly slapped the next second.

“Myriad Beast Gate doesn’t seem so impressive after all.” Lin Yun smiled as he looked at Lu Chen. He was smiling, but his smile was terrifyingly cold. “Why don’t you come at me, instead!”

“Stop him!” Lu Chen said after a brief pause.

When the Myriad Beast Gate’s disciples summoned their constellations, there were nearly twenty of them, and they released their third-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm cultivations. Their auras were linked together, and their constellations were also terrifying. They were of various demonic beasts. As boundless dragon origin mixed with demonic aura that spread out, the demonic beasts came out of their constellations.

“Death to anyone who dares to stand in my way!” Lin Yun had no intention of holding back, circulating the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra and Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon. As a terrifying demonic cauldron appeared from the dragon origin ocean, Lin Yun’s pupils became red, and a massive, ominous aura spread out.

As the destructive aura from the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron spread throughout his body, Lin Yun’s strength boosted significantly and a golden light spread out from him. He was alone, but his aura efficiently suppressed all the Myriad Beast Gate’s disciples, leaving the audience stumped.

Stomping his foot on the ground, Lin Yun dashed forth, causing everyone whom he passed through the suffocate from the immense pressure. All of the Myriad Beast Gate’s disciples were easily killed by Lin Yun after several exchanges.

“H-How is this possible?!” Everyone’s jaws nearly fell off because this was too terrifying. Lin Yun was like a living demonic god, killing all the Myriad Beast Gate’s disciples in just a few breaths. Those people were still saying they wanted to take Lin Yun’s head and offer it to Qin Tian, but they were all dead.

Lin Yun easily made it to the cliff without any hindrance. When his foot landed on the ridge, the entire world began to tremble as countless rocks fell from the cliff, and those rocks were like falling snow. This made everyone’s lips twitch as their faces became unnatural because Lin Yun’s vitality was too terrifying. He was like a ferocious beast.

Right then, golden light shone out from the cliff, catching everyone by surprise as they swiftly retreated even further, “What’s going on?”

This also surprised Lin Yun. A massive golden Buddha statue appeared before them when the entire cliff crumbled. The Buddha statue was seated with a smile, giving off a holy aura.

This shocked Lin Yun because he never expected that there would be a Buddha statue on the cliff. This meant that this Buddha statue probably had a huge secret, and there was a possibility that this might be an expert on the Buddhism path who died in ancient times. This expert probably became a saint by relying on his physique but died in that ancient battle.

When Lin Yun raised his head, he saw Lu Chen’s dark expression and wasn’t too surprised. He smiled because this meant Lu Chen knew about the cliff's secret. “You’re fortunate.”

“You’re courting death!” Lu Chen’s face distorted with killing intent brewing in his pupils. This was initially a massive opportunity for him, but it was now exposed. Even if he killed Lin Yun, it’s practically impossible for him to monopolize it now. He instantly made his move.

As he let out a ferocious roar, a black mist appeared from his pupils, and two dragon horns grew out from his head, with scales appearing on his face. He had taken a semi-human and dragon form, possessing the bloodline of the Dragon Clan.

But everyone could tell that his Dragon Clan’s bloodline wasn’t pure. At the very least, this was nothing compared to Tian Xuanzi. Even so, this made him look terrifying, and his roar sounded like an actual dragon roar and a painting unfolded behind him. It was a demonic dragon that had reached nearly a hundred feet, enveloped in black flames.

“Sky Incinerating Demonic Dragon!” Lu Chen opened his mouth and breathed out black flames. The flames were mixed with poison, instantly enveloping Lin Yun. This was a secret technique, and the power could even melt an ordinary saint artifact.

Even if geniuses in the same cultivation as him could withstand the flames using their dragon origin, there was no way they could block the poison in the flames. Not to mention that the power of the dragon flames was extremely terrifying, and it was comparable to the strongest attack of a cultivator at the pinnacle fourth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm.

At such a close distance, Lu Chen didn’t think Lin Yun could survive. The black flames even burnt through space. Lin Yun finally couldn’t withstand it and was forced to circulate his Blue Dragon Bone. When the surface of his body was covered in dragon runes, the flames couldn’t threaten him. As for the poison, it was too tender before the Blue Dragon Bone.Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“You’re still too tender to fight me!” Lu Chen said coldly.

Everyone still hadn’t come to their senses after seeing Lin Yun being enveloped by the torrential dragon flames. Lin Yun, who was invincible just a moment ago, was killed just like that? This made everyone feel terrible, but this was the reality. The demonic dragon from the painting made Lu Chen look like a majestic demonic deity.

“Hahaha. The Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple isn’t so impressive after all!”

“Almighty Senior Brother!”

“Flower Burial is nothing!” The remaining Myriad Beast Gate disciples were briefly stunned before they rejoiced upon seeing this scene.

But suddenly, a bizarre scene occurred. The flames began to revolve into a vortex. When everyone was wondering what was happening, the dragon flames swiftly disappeared into Lin Yun’s mouth, leaving everyone dumbfounded.

After Lin Yun devoured the dragon flames, he radiated with a purple-golden radiance and wasn’t injured. This made Lu Chen widen his mouth with his eyes bulging out.

“Here, you can have it back.” Lin Yun smiled. Taking a deep breath, the Blood Flame Divine Rune spat out the dragon flames he devoured, and the blazing flames instantly burnt through half the sky.
