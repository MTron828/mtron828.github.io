When the Realm Sons unleashed their holy spirit martial techniques, they destroyed the plaza even more. Boundless flames gushed out of the ground while countless rocks hovered in the sky.

As for the Nether Divinity Realm Son, he was pinned into a rock by the Flower Burial Sword. He continued to throw up blood as reluctance flashed in his eyes. Kneeling to Lin Yun two times was too great a humiliation for him.

At this moment, Lin Yun soared into the sky to face two Realm Sons at once.

The Realm Sons burst with killing aura as they watched Lin Yun charge at them. “You’re courting death!”

“Almighty Dragon Suppression!”

“Star Annihilator Demonic Elephant!” The two realm sons roared, pushing their holy spirit martial techniques to the limit. A dragon suddenly appeared behind the Profound Dragon Realm Son, which sealed the surrounding space.

Simultaneously, the Elysium Trigram Realm Son was enveloped by demonic aura. It looked like primal demonic runes were moving towards his palm.

Everything in the world was dull compared to their holy spirits. Then, the sound of Lin Yun’s sky sword intent shattering could be heard as he faced two holy spirit martial techniques.

“Holy shit, is this the genuine power of a holy spirit martial technique?”

“Isn’t it a little too terrifying? Even the sky sword intent couldn’t block it…”

“Sky sword intent is something that can only be grasped by empyreans, but holy spirit martial techniques aren’t supposed to be grasped in the Heavenly Soul Realm either. Lin Yun might have had a chance if it was only one holy spirit martial technique, but he’s facing two at once.” Someone made an analysis that explained the cracked sky sword intent. No matter what, everyone knew that the current situation wasn't good for Lin Yun.

“Is Lin Yun planning to face two enemies at once? His sword is suppressing the Nether Divinity Realm Son, so he’s already exhausted his vitality. How is he going to face two Realm Sons?” Lin Yun’s insane actions shocked everyone. After all, they knew that Lin Yun couldn’t bring out his holy spirit martial technique.

“It’s a shame that this has to come to an end…” The Imperial Diagram Realm Son’s eyes flashed because Lin Yun nearly turned the tables around. Unfortunately, the situation was too bleak for Lin Yun to salvage.

He didn’t think that Lin Yun could block two holy spirit martial techniques, not to mention suppressing the Nether Divinity Realm Son at the same time. If Lin Yun died, he could make a move for the ownerless Azure Dragon True Bone. So he didn’t care what happened in the fight.

Lin Yun’s sword aura crumbled in the face of two holy spirit martial techniques. He knew that there was no way he could resist the power of two holy spirit martial techniques with his current cultivation.

“Tsk, tsk!” The Nether Divinity Realm Son suddenly smiled. Then, he grabbed onto the Flower Burial Sword while blood dripped from his palms. He wanted to pull the sword out even if he had to undergo great pain. Meanwhile, the Elysium Trigram and Profound Dragon Realm Sons were also approaching Lin Yun to fully destroy his aura.

Right at this moment, Lin Yun shut his eyes and allowed his sword aura to crumble. He began to circulate the Azure Dragon Saint Art to recover his vitality and then formed seals with both of his hands. At this moment, a Golden Crow appeared on his left hand while a Silver Phoenix appeared on the right one.

“Holy spirit martial techniques?” Everyone was shocked and even the other Realm Sons started to doubt their eyes. Was Lin Yun insane? Did he dare to execute his holy spirit martial technique?

Lin Yun had cultivated two holy spirits, which meant that his level of exhaustion was pretty high. But not only was Lin Yun planning to bring out his holy spirit right, he even wanted to bring out the complete holy spirit.

Even if he could block both attacks, Lin Yun would lose all vitality. Suddenly, dragon energy began to pour out of the Azure Dragon True Bone, which replenished his depleted vitality.

As the Azure Dragon True Bone was activated, the Golden Crow and Silver Phoenix became realistic looking. Although Lin Yun’s sword intent was on the verge of collapse, the aura of his holy spirits were blazing violently.

Everyone was shocked by Lin Yun’s actions. They could tell that Lin Yun wasn’t invincible as his pale complexion made him look like he would collapse at any moment. However, his determination won their respect. Only Yue Weiwei looked at Lin Yun with regret.

She ignored the shackles on her body and began to struggle. She hated herself for being caught by the Realm Sons and placing Lin Yun in such a dangerous position. She still remembered Lin Yun’s promise to her.

“Futile!” The Elysium Trigram Realm Son sneered and the demonic runes grew even more brightly on his body. He and the Profound Dragon Realm Son had both executed their holy spirit martial techniques, so they were feeling great pressure.

“Golden Crow as heaven!” Lin Yun roared and opened his eyes. The Golden Crow then soared into the sky. Facing immense pressure, the Realm Sons couldn’t believe what was happening. Lin Yun’s sword intent was on the brink of collapse, so the power of his holy spirit didn’t make sense.

“How impudent. So what if you can still use your holy spirit marital technique? Can you possibly stop both of us?” The Profound Dragon Realm Son refused to believe that Lin Yun could take their holy spirit martial techniques head-on. Even if Lin Yun managed to do it, Lin Yun would be heavily injured and then his only outcome would be death.

Lin Yun ignored those words and continued to form seals. A Silver Phoenix flew away from his body and the ground instantly turned into a silver lake. Standing at the center of the lake, beads of sweat dripped from Lin Yun’s forehead. “Silver Phoenix as earth!”

Lin Yun could feel that his vitality would be exhausted in the next second. But he didn’t have a choice since this was the price of cultivating two holy spirits at the same time.

His body was on the verge of collapse as he felt himself swaying. But he endured it and roared, “Heaven and Earth, Unite!”

The Golden Crow and Silver Phoenix cast a gold and silver brilliance onto Lin Yun’s palm. Boundless energy poured into Lin Yun’s body while his heart beat.

Suddenly, heaven and earth began to tremble as many spectators threw up mouthfuls of blood. Those who were strong enough felt their hearts thumping out of their chests.

“Damn it, what’s going on?!” Many people began to panic as they circulated their origin energy to defend themselves from the weird beating. Even the two Realm Sons squinted their eyes in fear. Was this really a holy spirit martial technique they were witnessing?

“Go down!” Lin Yun roared and threw his punch out. In a split second, their holy spirits were torn into pieces by Lin Yun’s punch. Although they spit up blood, they naturally had dao armor to defend themselves as Realm Sons. However, the dao armor shattered the moment they made contact with Lin Yun’s fist.

As their dao armor shattered, blood began to flow down from their chest. Then, they fell to the ground. But Lin Yun didn’t pursue them and merely headed for the Dragon Imprisoning Stage.

This time, everyone was speechless as they watched Lin Yun. None of them could conceal the shock in their eyes because Lin Yun had just swept through the three war realms. It was unimaginable to think that Lin Yun was from the Profound Amber Realm.

“Sword!” Just when he was about to approach the Dragon Imprisoning Stage, Lin Yun waved his hand and the Flower Burial Sword pinning the Nether Divinity Realm Son flew into his hand. Grabbing hold of the sword, Lin Yun’s collapsing sword intent soared once more. Then, the phenomena of the Azure Firmament Tree appeared with blooming Iris Flowers.

Without any hesitation, Lin Yun swung his sword down and destroyed the cage. Now, his clothes were tattered and his face was pale. But when he looked at Yue Weiwei, he smiled and reached out with his hand, “Yue Weiwei, I’m here!”
