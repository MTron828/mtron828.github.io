Chapter 2042 - Li Daoyang's Breadth Of Mind!

“Don’t accuse me if you don’t have any evidence,” Lin Yun smiled.

“Ye Qingtian, don’t listen to him. You’ll die if you become the Heavenly Dao Holy Son because ‘heavenly dao’ isn’t something that just anyone can use as their title,” Crane Fairy said as she jumped out.

“It doesn’t matter. You’re from the Indigo Thunder Peak, right? You can also be called the Indigo Thunder Holy Son,” Li Daoyang smiled. “If you don’t like that, you can also be called the Nether Orchid Holy Son. Don’t you have a story with the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden? If it doesn’t work, you can also go for the Heavenly Yin Holy Son.”

“Don’t listen to him. Someone who doesn’t shower like him must be planning something. Ye Qingtian, come with me to see my master,” the Crane Fairy said.

Lin Yun nodded and cupped his fists together, wanting to leave. He had a favorable impression of Li Daoyang, but Li Daoyang’s suggestion didn’t sound that reliable.

“Ye Qingtian, why don’t you leave after listening to me?” Li Daoyang appeared a hundred meters away and stood in their way. When he released his aura, it was like an invisible wall that stopped Lin Yun and the Crane Fairy from taking another step forth.

Lin Yun’s face became grave, and he said, “Holy Son, what do you want?”

“You can leave, but leave after hearing me out. Or you can also use your sword to attack me. If you can make me take a step back, I’ll immediately leave,” Li Daoyang smiled.

“Ye Qingtian, don’t listen to him. He must be planning something bad. Go and teach him a lesson,” Crane Fairy hid behind Lin Yun.

Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts because he didn’t mind leaving after hearing what Li Daoyang had to say. But he also wanted to test out the current power of his Astral Sword Intent, and he naturally wouldn’t refuse it since Li Daoyang was willing to test his sword.

“I apologize in advance, then,” Lin Yun’s hand fell onto the Flower Burial Sword and released his Astral Sword Intent with his aura changing, giving off a powerful aura.

Seeing Lin Yun was serious about this, Li Daoyang couldn’t help bitterly smiling. But he didn’t step back and allowed Lin Yun to draw his sword.

When Lin Yun drew his sword, he divided it into thirteen figures that stabbed into thirteen different spots of Li Daoyang, executing Myriad Sword Unite. The last sword formed a circle, and Lin Yun’s sword ray looked alive.

But the Flower Burial Sword failed to stab through Li Daoyang’s body. It didn’t even leave any injuries and only caused sparks to fly around. At the same time, a powerful yang aura exploded from Li Daoyang, sending Lin Yun flying away.

Lin Yun lost his grip on the Flower Burial Sword with blood dripping from his palm. Most importantly, there were cracks on Lin Yun’s right-hand bone, which naturally shocked him.

Li Daoyang stood in the same position and said, “Not bad. To force me to release the dao yang aura, you can be considered the first beneath the Quasi-Saint Realm.”

Lin Yun flung his lips to the side and could only hear Li Daoyang praising himself. Bearing the pain of his right hand, Lin Yun took a deep breath and asked, “What’s your cultivation?”

“If I say I’m still not a Quasi-Saint, would you believe me?” Li Daoyang said.

Lin Yun widened his mouth. How was that possible? Lin Yun didn’t hold back in his attack, and he was confident that even someone at the Azure Origin Phase of the Quasi-Saint Realm would be injured.

Li Daoyang smiled, “You don’t have to feel shocked about it. My condition is special because I possess the Great Sun Saint Physique. Three years ago, I had an encounter, obtaining a Heavenly Devour Sacred Canon and devoured too many saint artifacts. This is why my saint physique transformed. But the saint artifacts haven’t completely fused into my saint physique, causing me to lose control of my saint physique as a result. It might be powerful, but I can’t control it or reach the Quasi-Saint Realm.”

“How many saint artifacts did you devour?” Lin Yun asked.

“Eighteen glory saint artifacts,” Li Daoyang replied.

“It’s no wonder…” Lin Yun replied after a brief shock. Li Daoyang couldn’t be determined with proper logic. But Lin Yun began to imagine how powerful Li Daoyang would become if the Heavenly Devour Sacred Canon fused with his saint physique. He asked, “This is why you can’t shower?”

Li Daoyang nodded and smiled, “My body is even hotter than a cauldron, and water will evaporate when it comes in contact with me. But I’ve gotten used to it, and you’ll realize it's pretty satisfying after you get used to it. Haha, you can also give it a try.”

“You’re smelly,” the Crane Fairy said with disdain.

When Li Daoyang glared at Crane Fairy, this scared Crane Fairy and she hid behind Lin Yun.

“Treat your injuries first,” Li Daoyang said.

Lin Yun no longer talked about it and swallowed a pellet, activating the Blue Dragon Bone to treat his injuries. A few minutes later, Lin Yun had already recovered from his injuries.

“You’re fine now? I’ll carry on then,” Li Daoyang went straight into the topic. “I want to become a Saint Lord, and I’m determined to bear the heavenly dao on my shoulders. But no one is confident when hearing this. I want you to become a holy son to become a replacement in case I die. Then again, I can also be your replacement if you want. It’s good if you can bear the heavenly dao, but I can bear it if you die.”

Lin Yun was stunned because he never expected Li Daoyang to be so ambitious, completely disregarding his life and death. This instantly made Lin Yun look at Li Daoyang in a higher light. But ‘replacement’ sounded weird for some reason.

“Why do you want to become a Saint Lord?” Lin Yun asked. “Becoming the Heavenly Dao Sect’s Saint Lord is difficult.”

Li Daoyang sighed, “The Golden Era is arriving, and a huge tribulation will follow. The Kunlun Realm will reshuffle along with it. The Heavenly Dao Sect might seem united, but it’s divided. The various clans have thoughts of their own, and the Heavenly Dao Sect will disperse if there’s an impact. If you’re a little outstanding, many forces within the Heavenly Dao Sect will come after your life. This was unimaginable in the past.”

Lin Yun had a first-hand experience of that and believed that it wouldn’t have happened in the past.

“Not only you, but many people have died in the past,” Li Daoyang said. “This isn’t their first time doing it; they’re too cocky. As for why I want to become a Saint Lord, it’s because someone has to stand out and tell them how ‘heavenly dao’ is written!”

Lin Yun’s heart throbbed, and his facial expression became grave while looking at Li Daoyang. Even the Serene Dust Great Saint told him to bear it when regarding Wang Muyan, and they couldn’t be touched without evidence.

Even a Great Saint had to be cautious, but Li Daoyang dared to stand out. Lin Yun couldn’t help admitting that Li Daoyang was befitting of his temper. He asked, “Why me?”Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Li Daoyang smiled and asked, “You need evidence to deal with those people? Did they require evidence to assassinate you in the Myriad Graves Valley?”

Lin Yun was briefly stunned, and Li Daoyang was ruthless to himself and his enemies.

Li Daoyang smiled, “You already have an answer in your heart, don’t you? This is the reason why I chose you because we’re the same kind of person, to a certain extent.”

“I don’t have a habit of not showering,” Lin Yun muttered.

Li Daoyang was speechless upon hearing that and bitterly smiled, “Alright. I need your answer now.”

“I have no intention of being a holy son now, but I can consider it. I’ll give you a proper answer when I’m back from the Sword Assembly,” Lin Yun replied after a brief consideration. He was willing to help Li Daoyang, and the Heavenly Dao Sect needed cleansing. Lin Yun also had no intentions of letting the clans do whatever they wanted, but he had to reconsider the position of a Saint Lord.

“You don’t have to go and cultivate within the Heavenly Dao Sect. The Sword Assembly is only an event for the Sword Alliance,” Li Daoyang said. “The main event is the Blue Dragon Record, where all the geniuses within the Kunlun Realm will flock over, in addition to the champions of the nine heavenly paths. If they manage to leave their names on the Blue Dragon Record, their name would be left behind for eternity, and they would have a position in the Golden Era.”

Hearing that, Lin Yun couldn’t help looking forward to it. He asked, “I have a reason to go to the Sword Assembly.”

Li Daoyang sighed upon hearing that and smiled, “Then I’ll wait for your good news. Crane Fairy, you can bring him to see your master. Am I so terrifying? Why are you hiding from me?”

Li Daoyang smiled and dragged Crane Fairy out.

After they left, Li Daoyang touched his chest, and he had bloodstains on his palm. He smiled, “I can’t remember the last time I have bled.”

While Lin Yun left with the Crane Fairy, he began pondering his attack. He couldn’t believe that Li Daoyang wasn’t a Quasi-Saint. He might not seem concerned about it, but he was actually concerned. He couldn’t believe that Li Daoyang managed to block an attack imbued with his Astral Sword Intent when he wasn’t a Quasi-Saint.

If Li Daoyang stepped onto the saint path, how powerful would he be? He now knew that Li Daoyang was worthy of his reputation as the Eastern Desolation’s Twin Stars.

“What are you playing with?” Lin Yun turned to see the Crane Fairy playing with a brown bead. The bead was dark, but Lin Yun could sense it containing a powerful energy.

“This is a treasure of the Dao Yang Holy Son called the Great Sun Saint Crystal,” the Crane Fairy smiled. “He gave it to me when we guarded you earlier. He might seem fierce, but he’s a good person. But Master has a lot of resources, so I don’t need it.”

“Why don’t you give it to me if you don’t need it?” Lin Yun asked. He needed resources and could tell that this brown bead wasn’t ordinary. Perhaps it would benefit his Astral Sword Intent.

“Alright,” the Crane Fairy gave it to Lin Yun and smiled, “I’m happy he thinks about me. You can have it instead since you possess dual sword stars.”

After Lin Yun stowed it, he smiled at Crane Fairy because this lass was really easy to fool.
