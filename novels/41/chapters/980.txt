Chapter 981 - Gathering in the Azure Dragon Palace

Lin Yun’s speed was on a completely different level when he pushed the Golden Crow Nine Transformations to the limit. As he raced forward, he noticed other people heading in the same direction as him.

As he passed people, they were shocked. Currently, Lin Yun was shining with golden brilliance like blazing flames. From afar, it looked like a Golden Crow shuttling through the sky. However, they could only sense Lin Yun’s powerful aura and they couldn’t see him.

Everyone wondered which one of the seven heads Lin Yun was. They even thought he was from another region.

When Lin Yun saw the crowd, he dissipated the Golden Crow Nine Transformations and used the Cloud Soaring Art. After all, he didn’t need to draw attention to himself. As he flew, he passed by many ruins that felt very ancient.

Looking around, he could see more and more people gathering. Anyone who could get to this point in the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm was strong.

“Hmmm?” Suddenly, starlight gathered in the sky and distorted space. In the depths of the starlight was a massive dragon that released a boundless aura.

“Is that the Azure Dragon Palace?” Lin Yun was briefly stunned before his eyes blazed with excitement. Increasing his speed, he joined the others in the sky who were taking a closer look at the distorted space.

Luo Chen, Qin Lin, and Jun Mengchen had arrived a long time ago. Clearly, they had a close relationship. As for the remaining four from the seven heads, they belonged to another faction and couldn’t be seen.

Luo Chen, Qin Lin, and Jun Mengchen saw Lin Yun and nodded their heads as a greeting. At the same time, Lin Yun nodded his head before turning his attention towards the massive vortex.

Within the massive dragon were many majestic buildings surrounding an ancient plaza. The plaza was filled with many ancient runes that formed a profound painting. When Lin Yun reached out, he felt a barrier in front of him. It appeared that everyone needed to wait to enter.

“An opportunity that far exceeds fortune…” Lin Yun sighed. This kind of opportunity could only be found in the Heavenly Path. It was impossible for a lower realm genius to experience anything like this. So the Heavenly Path was an opportunity to catch up with the top-tier geniuses.

As long as someone could accumulate enough opportunities, they would be able to transform and rise. They couldn’t choose how they were born, but they could grasp their fate in their hands. If one had the determination to rise, one could become a dragon. After all, it was the Divine Dragon Era.

But with everyone competing, it wouldn’t be easy to change one’s fate. While Lin Yun pondered his future prospects, he felt several cold gazes look at him. Four people were looking at him while emitting terrifying auras.

The pressure was horrifying and Lin Yun could sense killing intent from the gazes. Currently, Feng Xuanyi and the remaining seven heads were staring at him.

Feng Xuanyi didn’t bother hiding his killing intent while speaking to a black-clothed figure next to him. The black-clothed figure looked ordinary, but his aura wasn’t any weaker than Luo Chen’s.

“That must be Mu Xiuhan, the second ranked cultivator on the Azure Dragon Ranking…” Lin Yun guessed that Feng Xuanyi was talking about him to Mu Xiuhan.

Interesting…are they coming after me? Lin Yun sneered inwardly. Clearly, Feng Xuanyi’s team learned of his loss and wanted to make Lin Yun pay.

When the crowd saw what was happening, they started to clamor. After all, the movement of the seven heads was always heavily scrutinized. The crowd even started to feel nervous as any battle would implicate them.

Right at this moment, a figure appeared and drew many people’s attention.

“Yu Haotian!”

“That’s Yu Haotian? I heard that he’s also a genius from the Profound Amber Realm. He also seized the Glorymoon Constellation Palace’s inheritance.”

“Haha, not only that, but he’s hidden his strength quite deeply. He almost killed the Gloryfire and Glorywater Spirit’s owners.”

“He’s that terrifying?”

“You’ve not witnessed how terrifying he is. He even made the two astral spirits’ owners beg for their lives.”

“I wonder who is stronger, Lin Yun or him…” Yu Haotian’s appearance instantly caused a huge uproar.

When Yu Haotian obtained the Glorymoon Spirit, no one thought much about it. In fact, they looked down on him and mocked him whenever they could. However, his act of seizing the Glorymoon Constellation Palace had shocked many people.

“It’s been a long time, Lin Yun!” Yu Haotian wasn’t bothered by the gazes. After all, he was used to being the center of attention in the Profound Amber Realm. When Lin Yun saw Yu Haotian, he didn’t conceal the killing intent in his eyes.

“Looks like you’re pretty confident in your strength,” said Lin Yun coldly. They had an irreconcilable feud because Yu Haotian tried to kill him time and time again. Not only did Yu Haotian injure Yue Weiwei, but he even threatened to annihilate the Sword Firmament Pavilion, which had crossed Lin Yun’s bottom line. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Then again, Yu Haotian was quite lucky because he survived Lin Yun’s onslaught multiple times. There was no way that Lin Yun would feel comfortable with Yu Haotian around. Furthermore, he couldn’t guarantee that his friends back in the Sword Firmament Pavilion wouldn’t be harmed. On top of that, Yue Weiwei told Lin Yun to get rid of Yu Haotian as soon as possible because of the karma between them.

Sensing the killing intent coming from Lin Yun, Yu Haotian smiled coldly, “Brother Lin, why are you in such a hurry? Don’t worry, we will resolve our feud. Not only will I pay back the humiliation you gave me a hundredfold, but I’ll also kill every single person you care about!”

Yu Haotian was trying to provoke Lin Yun on purpose. He seemed to be confident that Lin Yun wouldn’t dare to make a move against him.

Feng Xuanyi’s party was staring at Lin Yun with playful gazes. Evidently, the feud between Yu Haotian and Lin Yun had far exceeded their imagination. They wouldn’t mind enjoying a show before entering the Azure Dragon Palace.

“Brat, don’t fight with so many people around. If you die here, I won’t mind eating you.” A charming voice sounded out just as killing intent began to surge in Lin Yun’s pupils. It was Pei Xue, who had just appeared next to Luo Chen’s party. Her appearance had instantly drawn everyone’s attention, including Feng Xuanyi’s group.

“I wonder if she’s a friend or an enemy,” muttered Lin Yun after calming down a little.
