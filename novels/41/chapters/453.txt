Chapter 454 - Life and Death

Lin Yun used the floating platforms as launching points to soar into the sky. The further he went, the more dangerous it became. When another crimson bolt of lightning tore through the clouds towards Lin Yun, he threw a punch at it.

He destroyed the first bolt of lightning, but another one was already on its way. Lin Yun was barely able to withstand the bolts of lightning and was struck down by them. When he landed on a platform, it cracked under the immense pressure. When the lightning dissipated, Lin Yun’s face was pale as blood dripped from the corner of his lips.

Stomping his foot on the ground and shattering the platform, Lin Yun shot into the sky like an arrow. He was circulating his sword intent to the highest level to face the incoming bolts of lightning.

Just when he was about to charge into the crimson clouds, a phenomenon suddenly occurred. The crimson clouds began to form a skull that tried to devour Lin Yun.

Within the crimson skull’s path, all the platforms were devoured. Lin Yun knew that his physique wasn’t as strong as those platforms, so he would be dead if he was devoured. But Lin Yun wasn’t someone who would give up easily.

His body suddenly paused and a wind started blowing around him. As the wind started to grow bigger and bigger, it grew to the point that the heaven and earth were trembling.

Where does the wind come from? When the crimson skull approached, Lin Yun’s eyes were opened wide and he slapped the clouds with his palm.

Great Wind Scripture!

A huge palm sank into the crimson clouds and ripped them apart. The skull shattered, allowingLin Yun to charge past. However, there was a thin membrane that prevented him from proceeding. Lin Yun briefly thought about his next move.

Raising his head, Lin Yun released his sword intent and appeared in front of the membrane in the blink of an eye. Raising his fist, he threw a punch that combined the four seals. The collision created cracks on the membrane, but the membrane was still intact.

At the same time, a powerful rebound force blasted him away.

“Is it starting?” commented Lord Thirteen as he looked at the exploding bamboo.

“In the name of my sword, bloom!” Lin Yun started forming seals and a colossal Iris Flower appeared behind him. In a split second, Lin Yun’s aura surged. He immediately charged forward ten times faster than before and crashed into the membrane.

“Break!” His fist was like a sword that fell onto the membrane.

“I did it!” Lin Yun’s face flashed with joy when cracks began to spread out. Without any hesitation, he charged through the crack.

In that split second, a sword ray was being gathered together in the Sword Burial Woods that charged into the sky. This instantly caught everyone’s attention in the capital. After all, the sword ray was bright in the darkness.

“What did I just see?”

“Stars lighting up… Wait, is that a sword ray?”

“What’s going on?”

“Is the Great Qin Empire changing?” Many people even suspected that their eyes were messing with them.

Some of the elders from the various sects looked in the direction of the Sword Burial Woods with strange expressions. They murmured, “That direction… Is that the Sword Firmament Pavilion?”

The phenomenon prevented many people from getting sleep. There was too much going on, especially now that the new titled figures were born. They couldn’t help but think that this phenomenon was a sign.

“How majestic!” Lin Yun stood on the ancient platform on the sixth level. There was only one platform in the sixth level, the one he was standing on. There were no thunderclouds in the sky, but a starry sky. It feels as if the stars were within his reach.

When Lin Yun focused his attention, he realized that the sky was a starry diagram formed with sword intent spiritual runes and that the sword intent contained in every star was shocking.

“How terrifying…” Lin Yun began to look around. The platform he was standing on was the only one here, so he summoned his Flower Burial Sword without any thought.

An ancient and eerie voice suddenly rang out, “You won’t be allowed out of this place if you can’t comprehend the xiantian sword intent…”

When the ancient voice disappeared, sword rays suddenly descended. The sword intent contained in the ray was shocking and seemed to possess destructive prowess. Each ray was like a star that descended from the sky.

When the stars began to converge together, the platform beneath Lin Yun trembled in fear. In the blink of an eye, the starlight devoured Lin Yun. When he was devoured, he could sense countless thoughts appearing in his mind.

Lin Yun didn’t dare to do anything else and immediately sorted his thoughts. A long while later, Lin Yun was shrouded with origin energy as he began to dance on the platform with his sword. When his origin energy roared, the sword rays would leave deep marks on the platform.

“I’ll have to create my own sword to grasp the xiantian sword intent. The Heavenly Cloud Shatter might seem to be a move that I created, but in reality, it was born from Aquaselenic Sword. It might be strong, but there are too many imprints that don’t belong to me. So it’s not completely a sword that belongs to me…” It was just like Bai Lixuan’s Thundercloud Crusher or Heartcliff’s Astral Devour.

But creating a sword that totally belonged to him wasn’t easy.

“If I succeed, then, without question, I’ll be ahead of many people. I’ll have my own sword and I will also grasp the xiantian sword intent. At that time, I will be confident to fight against Qin Yu.” Lin Yun’s face was grave because he knew that he would die if he was trapped here.

But right at this moment, he was feeling extremely emotional. This was a swordsman’s thirst for the xiantian sword intent. Shortly after, Lin Yun began to swing his sword on the ancient stage, performing everything that he had learned to seek his own path.

Meanwhile, he was also waiting for the next starlight to descend. After all, the starlight gave him lots of inspiration. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

A long time later, Lin Yun had undergone eight starlights. He could sense that he was getting endlessly close to the xiantian sword intent with every starlight. However, there seemed to be a barrier standing in his way. The fast progress was highly related to the fact that he had a high comprehension when it came to swords.

“The Flowing Wind Sword, Thunderclap Sword, Overlord Sword, and Aquaselenic Sword… Those are the four sword techniques that I’ve learned so far. Aside from the Overlord Sword, I’ve already reached the highest possible mastery in the three other sword techniques. What I have to do is to make use of my comprehension to break through this barrier.” Lin Yun rejoiced when he realized that he was getting close to the xiantian sword intent.

Right at this moment, Lord Thirteen’s voice echoed out, “Brat, you’ve already basked in eight starlights. If you’re still unable to grasp the xiantian sword intent by the ninth starlight, the following starlights will start to hurt. I told you that you shouldn’t come to the sixth level without a Violet Palace Realm cultivation. This is your last chance because no one will be able to save you after this.”

Lord Thirteen’s words were like a bucket of water that rained down on Lin Yun’s head. His face instantly became serious. The ninth starlight was his last chance.

Lin Yun raised his head and looked at the starlight gathering in the starry sky.
