Chapter 1123 - Crimson Moon, Bashful Beauty

Two days later, the radiating silver moonlight lit up the Qiu Clan’s residence. However, no one was in the mood to admire the moon. Everyone, including Patriarch Qiu, had a face full of anxiety and solemnity.

Today was the appointed time with Thunderclap Sword Demon. Since the Qiu Clan didn’t prepare the Divine Astral Pellets that Thunderclap Sword Demon had requested, they needed to prepare for a massacre.

Although Patriarch Qiu was composed, his eyes flashed with ferocity. He was determined to make Thunderclap Sword Demon pay if he dared to show up.

Right at this moment, a burst of laughter sounded out that broke the silence in the hall, “Hahaha! Qiu Clan, did you prepare the Divine Astral Pellets that I asked for?”

The laughter was filled with arrogance, which made many people fearful. “He’s here!”

Thunderclap Sword Demon was a brutal demonic cultivator that openly killed the core disciples of the four major sects. Furthermore, he was in the Galaxy Stage, and not many people could face him aside from some core disciples from the four major sects. There were even some rumors that he had even killed Astral Stage geniuses.

“Let’s go!” Patriarch Qiu took the lead without any change on his face. When the group came out of the hall, they could see a black figure standing on the roof up ahead. He was donned in black clothes, and he looked a lot younger than everyone had imagined. Additionally, he was enveloped with a baleful aura that made his handsome face look devilish.

There were rumors that he was the disciple of a powerful sect in Ancient Barren Domain with terrifying strength. However, he was expelled from the sect and forced to become a wandering cultivator. So if he didn’t kill for resources, he wouldn’t be able to make any progress in his cultivation. So as time passed, he naturally became a demonic cultivator.

“That’s Thunderclap Sword Demon?” Lin Yun was also looking at this person while wearing his silver mask. He could sense the demeanor of a disciple belonging to big sects from this person. It seemed like the rumors were true, Thunderclap Sword Demon was expelled from a powerful sect.

Two days had passed and Lin Yun had recovered from all his injuries. So much so that he even took a step further in his cultivation, strengthening the origin energy in his aura oceans by a lot. Even the Demonic Astral Flowers in his aura oceans were shining brightly.

“Sorry, but my Qiu Clan can’t afford 8,000 Divine Astral Pellets. Then again, we wouldn’t give it to you even if we could afford it,” said Patriarch Qiu coldly.

“No matter. I have always been a reasonable person. You can just give me your life.” The Thunderclap Sword Demon grinned, but his words made everyone feel a chill down their spines. Then, he left behind afterimages as he landed on the empty ground before the hall.

With an outburst of baleful aura, he forced all the empyreans from the Qiu Clan to become pale. They were shocked to discover that their origin energy became stagnant and could no longer circulate properly.

Wisps of faint crimson aura were emitted from the Thunderclap Sword Demon before spreading out on the ground like tentacles. The Qiu Clan’s empyreans felt like they were suffocating from the bizarre baleful aura.

With each step that Leng Aohan took, everyone’s hearts began to beat faster. After seven steps, Leng Aohan came to a stop. He glared at those surrounding Patriarch Qiu, making them go flying while spitting blood. In that split second, they felt like they were being grabbed by an invisible force with a hammer striking against their chests.

But to Leng Aoran, it was just a small trick as he looked at Patriarch Qiu and grinned, “You still want to carry on? You think you can rely on these so-called core disciples to fend me off?”

Patriarch Qiu’s heart sank when he heard that. It appeared that Thunderclap Sword Demon knew of the core disciples that he gathered.

The moment Thunderclap Sword Demon finished his words, figures began to charge out from various corners of the courtyard to seal off the entire area. When the core disciples from the various sects released their aura, they tried to restrict Leng Aoran.

Their aura was like a mountain range pressing down on the Thunderclap Sword Demon, while Yan Teng, Xuan Fei, and Lei Lan all hovered in the sky. All of them emitted starlight from their bodies while staring at Thunderclap Sword Demon.

“The Thunderclap Sword Demon is indeed decisive. Plus, the way you manipulate your baleful aura is brilliant.” Yan Teng smiled while he looked at Thunderclap Sword Demon calmly with a smile full of confidence.

Thunderclap Sword Demon looked around before he smiled, “What a great formation. Looks like my head is pretty precious.”

He had no fear and even looked excited. This was also the reason why he left the Qiu Clan a note, declaring his arrival beforehand. After all, these core disciples were wealthy and carried many pellets bestowed to them by their sects. They might even have holy spirit martial techniques on them.

This was his real target. After all, fifteen days was enough for the Qiu Clan to shift their wealth away. Instead, he was focused on the wealth of the core disciples. Even though there were many core disciples around, they weren’t guaranteed to have perfect chemistry. So he really could benefit from this encounter.

He was confident because he had never failed once. Even if he ran into genuine experts, he only suffered some light injuries and was still able to flee.

“Me, Brother Lei, and Brother Xuan will be responsible for dealing with him. The rest of you will just be responsible for sealing off the entire place to ensure that he doesn’t escape.” Yan Teng’s voice sounded out as he had no intention of letting anyone interfere in dealing with Thunderclap Sword Demon. His words were mainly meant for the other core disciples from their three sects. He didn’t even consider the existence of the other sects.

He knew that everyone was here to fish for benefits, and that they might even be an obstruction to the fight. So, he descended with Lei Lan and Xuan Fei in a triangle formation that sealed off every single direction of Thunderclap Sword Demon.

Lei Lan slowly drew out a sword under the moonlight. He swung his dao artifact sword casually, causing the ground to tremble violently. Meanwhile, Xuan Fei pulled out a staff while smiling sinisterly. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

As for Yan Teng, he merely stood with his hands behind him and didn’t take out any weapon. But even so, the aura that he released was the strongest. As he circulated the King Suspend Art, he emitted a faint imperial pressure that slowly merged with his empyrean aura. At this moment, he looked like an actual emperor.

Everyone was shocked when they realized that there were no weaklings among the top sects. It didn’t matter if it was Yan Teng or the others, any single one of them could suppress the crowd. It seemed like there was hope to take Thunderclap Sword Demon down.

Looking at this scene, Leng Aoran smiled, “I love dealing with you disciples from the four major sects. But it’s a pity that there are no disciples from the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect.”

“Don’t worry. After tonight, there will be no more Thunderclap Sword Demon in the Profound Azure Manor!” Yan Teng smiled.

“Hahaha!” Thunderclap Sword Demon laughed as the baleful aura slowly squirmed around him, causing the ferocious aura emitted from him to rise even further. His laughter was like a demonic tune that echoed in everyone’s ears.

If one didn’t have strong willpower, they would be dragged into an illusion by the burst of laughter and enveloped in fear. In the next second, several people became bloodshot.

“Let’s go!” Yan Teng’s face changed, not wanting to give Thunderclap Sword Demon any advantages.

“Divine Demon Subduing Staff!” Xuan Fei was the first to make his move, using his staff to execute the famous Demon Subduing Staff from the Azure Thunder Monastery. Lightning flickered on the surface of his body and the staff before he used his staff to make a stab. Instantly, he created a hole in the space before him while countless Buddhist runes swiftly formed a majestic painting.

The huge sound produced by his attack interrupted Thunderclap Sword Demon’s burst of laughter as the painting formed into a golden ‘卍’ mark that flew towards Thunderclap Sword Demon.

“Dancing celestial cranes in the depth of white clouds!” Lei Lan’s figure began to turn illusory as his sword aura manifested into a sea of clouds. When the sword ray bloomed in the sea of clouds, the sword ray looked like a celestial crane.

Then, Yan Teng pushed his palm out. Although he used the least amount of effort, his attack was the strongest. A gigantic palm descended from the sky, while heaven and earth began to shrink in size. The three of them didn’t hold back as they executed their strongest attacks. Clearly, they didn’t want the battle with Thunderclap Sword Demon to drag on.

“Well done!” Thunderclap Sword Demon smiled and a sword appeared in his hand before anyone could respond. He merely responded with a swing of his sword. As a crimson sword ray flew out, the ‘卍’ mark that was flying towards him was cut in half.

Then, he swung his sword once more, unleashing a crimson sword ray that manifested into a python. The python soared into the sky and clashed with Lei Lan’s attack, resolving the attack.

Then, Leng Aoran unleashed another crimson sword ray that manifested into a dragon. The crimson demonic dragon collided with the gigantic palm descending from the sky. Just like that, Leng Aoran easily dealt with the attacks from the three core disciples from three major sects.

In the end, Xuan Fei took five steps back, Lei Lan took seven steps back, and Yan Teng took two steps back.

“You are still too tender to fight me!” Leng Aoran’s eyes flashed coldly with a disdain on his face. It was so humiliating that the faces of Yan Teng’s group became ugly. Although they knew that there was a difference between them and Leng Aoran, they didn’t think that the difference would be so huge.

“Tonight, I’ll show you why I, Leng Aoran, am called Thunderclap Sword Demon!” Leng Aoran roared as his killing aura dyed the entire night red. Even the moon was dyed red like a bashful beauty.
