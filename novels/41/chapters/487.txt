Chapter 488 - Breaking The Array

Lin Yun travelled through the forest with a grave expression because he didn’t dare to be careless. He stopped on a tree branch briefly and closed his eyes. When he closed his eyes, his sword intent fluctuated out and he started to sense the peculiar energy rippling in the air once more. It sounded like a crying ghost or a musical instrument.

“Is it over there?” Lin Yun opened his eyes and he looked at the direction where the sound was coming from. He was confident that his sword intent was pointing him in the right direction. Without any hesitation, he executed the Seven Profound Steps and left behind afterimages in the forest.

As he gradually approached, he could hear the music even clearer. He was right that someone was controlling the Draconian Rockrats. Without any signs, Lin Yun came to a stop. Several black-clothed men dashed out from the woods as they looked at him.

“Kill him!” The black-clothed men charged at him without any hesitation. This also meant that the mastermind couldn’t free himself anytime soon. But they must be dreaming to think that they could kill him with only this many people.

Looking at the black-clothed men charging over, Lin Yun’s eyes lit up. A dragon and tiger roar echoed out from his body and he threw out his punch that was covered in a silvery glow. It flew at them like a bolt of lightning.

His punch easily knocked the black-clothed men back as they burst into clouds of blood. It was a lethal attack that claimed their lives instantly. With 90% of his origin energy converted, he could crush all the opponents who had a lower cultivation than him. He then waved his hand and took their interspatial pouches.

“This feels good. If I can get my sword back, I should be able to face lesser Yin stage cultivators,” smiled Lin Yun confidently. He tapped on the ground and shot out like an arrow. As he got closer to the mastermind, the number of black-clothed men he encountered along the way increased. But they were only in the eighth or ninth stage of the Profound Martial Realm.

Back when he was in the Great Qin Empire, he could easily crush people with that level of cultivation. Now that he was a lot stronger, it was even easier.

“That’s…” Lin Yun landed on an ancient tree and saw a spiritual rune array up ahead. The entire array was set up with third grade spiritual jades and it looked like at least a thousand had been used.

There was a black-clothed man seated in the center of the array with dozens of skulls around him. The array was bizarre, filled with an evil energy.

“How generous…” Lin Yun was shocked by the spiritual jades used to set up this array. At the same time, the black-clothed man suddenly raised his head. When Lin Yun saw the black-clothed man, he knew his guess was right. The man was wearing a raccoon mask as he blew on a bone flute. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

As he blew the bone flute, the array circulated and the skulls around him would constantly emit black miasma. This must be the array that manipulated the Draconia Rockrats. The mysterious person Lin Yun saw back on the Bloodwing Pavilion’s boat really was the culprit.

“Damn it!” The black-clothed man’s eyes gushed with killing aura as the music suddenly changed. A terrifying miasma swept out from his body and blew towards Lin Yun.

“Weird…” Lin Yun frowned his brows. But he didn’t panic at the attack. A dragon and tiger roar echoed out from his body and he threw his punch forward to clash against the black miasma. The clash made the ground tremble and the surrounding trees began to collapse.

In the next second, the miasma formed a sinister-looking skull that flew towards Lin Yun.

Lin Yun spread his arms apart and soared into the sky, forming the Golden Vajra Seal. When the skull was close, Lin Yun sent the seal flying to destroy it instantly.

“What powerful origin energy!” The masked man was shocked and he started gathering the black miasma once more.

“Soul Devouring Hand!” The black miasma formed a crimson hand that enveloped Lin Yun. It felt like the hand could even crush his soul.

Courting death! Lin Yun sneered inwardly as he started forming seals again. This time, it was the Demon Vanquishing Seal. The gigantic sword pierced through the crimson hand easily, but in the next second, a figure dashed out under the moonlight.

“Get lost!” Lin Yun’s aura soared and he unleashed the Heavenly Seal. His origin energy formed eighteen sword rays that shot out. Under the empowerment of the Heavenly Seal, Lin Yun sent his attacks into the array towards the masked man.

The masked man began to panic because he didn’t even have any time to react. In the end, the array was disrupted and he had no choice but to retreat.

Feeling helpless, the black-clothed man placed the bone flute down and began to run. But the skulls that were emitting black miasma suddenly exploded. They turned into a crimson vortex that shot towards the masked man.

This made the masked man throw up a mouthful of blood because he was suffering from the backlash of the array. Lin Yun could sense that the masked man had been weakened by at least 50%. This was a great opportunity for Lin Yun to kill the masked man.

He started to form seals, this time combining all four. A terrifying aura surged from Lin Yun’s body when the four seals combined and Lin Yun’s aura reached a terrifying height that far exceeded what a quasi-Violet Palace Realm cultivator could unleash.

“You’re courting death!” The masked man was enraged as he pushed his palm out in Lin Yun’s direction. A crimson hand flew out in the air towards Lin Yun.

When Lin Yun’s fist clashed with the crimson hand, illusions began to appear in Lin Yun’s mind that briefly dazed him. He could see a sea of corpses laid before him. An illusion?

“Hmph, killing you will be as easy as crushing an ant if it’s not for the fact that I have to control the array,” sneered the masked man. His dried-up hand stretched out from his sleeve and headed for Lin Yun’s heart. But just when he was about to reach Lin Yun, a boundless sword intent burst out from Lin Yun’s body.

“I was tricked…” The masked man was shocked. Lin Yun could have broken the illusion much earlier, but he waited on purpose.

“You want to run? It’s too late!” snorted Lin Yun as he sent the four combined seals at the masked man’s chest.

The masked man was blown away and he threw up a mouthful of blood. When he fell onto the ground, he disappeared in the next second and only left behind a mask. When Lin Yun raised his head, the masked man was already gone.

Lin Yun picked up the raccoon mask, but he didn’t chase after the masked man. There was something unusual about this man, so it wouldn’t be so easy for Lin Yun to defeat him if he didn’t suffer the backlash from the array. Furthermore, Lin Yun was weakened without his sword.

Back in the Heavenly Province Academy’s camp, the place was covered with blood. All of a sudden, the Draconian Rockrats suddenly fled.

“What’s going on?” Many disciples were shocked.

Even Liu Yunyan was surprised. But she merely thought about it briefly before she spoke out, “Count the casualties. Don’t let your guards down because they might come back any time.”

Now that everyone had finally relaxed, groans began to sound out in the camp.

“Bai Yi, did you kill them yourself?”

“Wow…”

“Holy shit, eighteen Draconian Rockrats!” An exclamation sounded out as everyone surrounded Bai Yi.

Even Liu Yunyan frowned her brows as she walked over. This made Bai Yi’s face blush as she quickly waved her hand, “I didn’t. It was Big Brother Lin. Furthermore, he even said that these demonic beasts were being manipulated. He must’ve defeated the mastermind. Otherwise, those demonic beasts wouldn’t have fled.”

Right now, she was excited that Lin Yun really managed to do it.

“Lin Yun?” Many people couldn’t believe it.

“Are you sick in your mind?” Lu Siyin was enraged as she walked over. She snorted, “What nonsense are you talking about? A sword slave is capable of killing this many Draconian Rockrats? The demonic beasts were clearly chased away by us, but you’re saying that a sword slave did it? Are you courting death?”

The Heavenly Province Academy’s disciples soon nodded their heads inwardly as they looked at Bai Yi weirdly. The demonic beasts suffered huge casualties under their retaliation, so it was a little too hilarious that Bai Yi said it was all thanks to Lin Yun’s contribution.

“‘I’m serious. It must be Big Brother Lin. He promised me before he left!” Bai Yi mustered up her courage.

“What nonsense! That sword slave must’ve fled. Mention that cripple once more and I’ll slap you to death!” Lu Siyin stomped her way over with a darkened face. She was already furious that she was messed up by the Flower Burial Sword. She initially wanted to look for Lin Yun after the battle, but Lin Yun was nowhere to be found. So she naturally vented her anger on Bai Yi instead.

“It’s Big Brother Lin. He promised to help us,” said Bai Yi with her teeth gnashed.

“You’re courting death!” Lu Siyin’s gaze turned dark as she raised her hand. But just when she raised her hand, she felt a chill run down her spine as she was locked onto by killing aura. When she turned her head over, she saw Lin Yun looking at her coldly.

“L-l-l-lin…” Lu Siyin’s voice began to tremble, but she had no idea why she was afraid of this sword slave.

“Is she someone you can touch?” Lin Yun bolted out and slapped Lu Siyin on her face without any warning.
