Chapter 2027 - Don't Shake Your Head

When Jin Xuanyi’s headless corpse collapsed, his heavy arms caused a cloud of dust to rise from the arena.

Everyone came to their senses when they heard the huge thud, and only one person was standing in the arena. At this moment, everyone finally believed that Jin Xuanyi was dead. Just like that, a legendary figure who was determined to shine during the Golden Era, someone who was rumored to have killed a Quasi-Saint that was at the Azure Origin Phase, had died in the hands of Ye Qingtian, the genius swordsman of the Heavenly Dao Sect.

“How is this possible…?” Wang Muyan couldn’t help exclaiming with her face changed. Others might not know, but she knew that Jin Xuanyi had indeed killed a Quasi-Saint before. Although that Quasi-Saint was only in the Azure Origin Phase, a Quasi-Saint with saint aura was invincible when compared to cultivators at the Nirvana Stage.

Furthermore, Jin Xuanyi had many means that he had yet to use and yet he died just like that. This was why no one could accept what they were seeing. They were expecting a tough battle, even if Ye Qingtian managed to win.

“Holy Maiden, what do you mean by that?” Xin Yan turned to look at Wang Muyan with an ugly expression. Everyone else from the Heavenly Dao Sect also turned to look at Wang Muyan.

Wang Muyan immediately came to her senses and awkwardly smiled, “Although I’ve guessed that Ye Qingtian could win, I didn’t expect him to win the fight so easily.”

Everyone finally understood what Wang Muyan said. They actually shared the same thoughts as well. They didn’t expect Ye Qingtian to be so strong.

Elder Shi Feng sighed, “Same goes for me. This battle is like a dream.”

But he soon smiled excitedly, “But since Ye Qingtian killed Jin Xuanyi, not only did we retrieve the Divine Blood Flower, but the Heavenly Dao Sect’s reputation will also rise along with him! Ye Qingtian is now ranked first on the King Ranking!”

He initially thought it foolish to let Ye Qingtian fight Jin Xuanyi, but the outcome was a huge surprise.

“I’m afraid it won’t be that easy,” Xin Yan calmly said.

“So we still have to depend on him in the end. Eighteen years ago, Jian Jingtian was known as One Sword Jingtian. But from today onwards, Senior Brother Ye will be known as One Sword Qingtian! Hahaha!” Wang Yue laughed.

“One Sword Qingtian?” The Ming Cult’s Zhang Ziling sneered beside the Quasi-Saint, Jiu Yang. He said, “Ye Qingtian, let me ask you. What is the name of that sword?”

“Light of the Beginning,” Lin Yun replied from the arena as he looked at Zhang Ziling.

“Light of the Beginning, a sword so fast that it leaves no traces behind. It’s truly worthy of this name,” Zhang Ziling sighed, but his tone suddenly changed. He said, “But you’re only lucky. You cannot be compared to Jin Xuanyi in regards to cultivation, foundation, or opportunities. The Qilin lineage has four major inheritances: Lightning, Fire, Wind, and Water. Jin Xuanyi obtained the Lightning Qilin’s inheritance. Not only did he fuse the power of Qilin into his arms, but also his feet. He also refined a Qilin Core and used it to kill a Quasi-Saint at the Azure Origin Phase.”

Zhang Ziling’s words made everyone come to their senses because that was the case.

“What are you trying to say?” Lin Yun asked.

“Am I not clear enough? Jin Xuanyi didn’t use his full strength out of concern for the five other holy lands,” Zhang Ziling said. “You’re only lucky that you managed to kill him and merely took advantage of him. If you two fought again, you’d probably not be able to take a single attack from him.”

“I see, so you’re trying to say that I’ve actually lost the battle?” Lin Yun asked.

“Not exactly. You did win, but your win isn’t righteous. So don’t really think that you’re ranked first on the King Ranking and can be called One Sword Qingtian,” Zhang Ziling replied.

The other holy lands’ geniuses all agreed with what Zhang Ziling said. Zhang Ziling had said what was in their hearts. If Jin Xuanyi wasn’t fearful of them, Ye Qingtian probably wouldn’t even last a move under Jin Xuanyi.

Seeing that Ye Qingtian fell silent, Zhang Ziling said in disdain, “What’s the matter? Are you unconvinced? Do you want me to reveal everything behind your sword earlier?”

“I’m all ears,” Lin Yun replied.

“It looks like you won’t give up. Since it’s a sword technique, there must be traces left behind. You might be able to fool others, but you can’t fool me. I have a sword myself; why don’t you experience it?” Zhang Ziling smiled as his right hand fell onto his sword, releasing a dazzling radiance when he drew it.

Everyone saw two intertwining sword marks left on the arena when everything settled down. The arena was fortified by saint runes, thus making it tougher than ordinary stone. But the cut left on the arena was clean. So one could imagine how sharp Zhang Ziling’s attacks were.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The two sword marks reached as far as a hundred feet and were only one inch away from Ye Qingtian. This made everyone take in a cold breath as they looked at Zhang Ziling with their faces changed.

The Ming Cult’s Quasi-Saint, Jiu Yang, turned to look at Shi Feng and smiled, “Brother Shi, don’t make a declaration so quickly. It’s still uncertain who will obtain the Divine Blood Flower and be first on the King Ranking.”

Shi Feng’s face was ashen when he heard that.

“What do you think?” Zhang Ziling gave Ye Qingtian a provocative gaze, and he said, “Your sword might be fast, but you’re just trying to fool the eyes using light. Your sword can be traced.”

Everyone finally understood what was going on after hearing Zhang Ziling’s words because that really seemed like the case. So when they looked at Ye Qingtian again, the solemnness in their pupils disappeared.

“Others can’t see through your sword and found it powerful, but you can’t fool my eyes,” Zhang Ziling pridefully said. He continued, “That’s one. As for the second point, you’re too slow, even if your sword is powerful, regardless of your attacking speed or movement technique. This is why you tried to numb Jin Xuanyi into approaching you, and your attainment in the sword isn’t as high as everyone thinks.”

Lin Yun didn’t say a word and merely looked at Zhang Ziling.

“That seems to make some sense?”

“Zhang Ziling managed to see through Ye Qingtian’s sword with a gaze. Should I say as expected of Ming Cult’s geniuses?”

“Hahaha! I already said it’s impossible for a legendary figure like Jin Xuanyi to die so easily!”

“It’s a pity that he died before he could fully unleash his strength. Ye Qingtian is really low to use such a scheme.” Everyone around the arena began to discuss amongst themselves, and even Qu Duan nodded.

Zhang Ziling’s words made more sense that way. After all, Jin Xuanyi was invincible on the King Ranking, and so Ye Qingtian merely took advantage of the fact that Jin Xuanyi couldn’t unleash his full strength. Everyone acknowledged that Jin Xuanyi was stronger.

“That Ye Qingtian is really shrewd. Even I was fooled by him,” Qu Duan said softly.

“I have a feeling something isn’t right.” Li Yanxian muttered to himself. He could feel that Ye Qingtian’s sword wasn’t just fast but was accompanied by the phenomenon of the world being established. But the entire process of a world being born was disrupted by nirvana, and it disappeared when you wanted to take a clear look at it.

That light was different from the light Zhang Ziling displayed. Li Yanxian couldn’t describe it properly, but it felt like a firefly’s light being compared to the light from the sun and moon.

“What’s wrong with it? I'll be going if no one is going on the stage.” Qu Duan was excited to go on the stage and prove himself.

Lin Yun looked at Zhang Ziling from the arena and asked, “Are you done?”

“ There’s no need to hurry. There’s still one last pointer. You only unleashed one sword, but I unleashed two. If you can’t touch me, you won’t have the opportunity to draw your sword,” Zhang Ziling smiled.

“Why don’t you come up, then?” Lin Yun waved his hand.

Zhang Ziling mocked, “I don’t think that’s good. After all, no one’s safety isn’t ensured in the arena, and you’re a ‘genius’ swordsman from the Heavenly Dao Sect. It will be a pity if you die on the stage.”

“It doesn’t matter. Since you spent the effort to waste so much saliva by talking, I can give you this opportunity,” Lin Yun said. He turned around and continued, “If anyone has any opinions about my victory, you can also come to the arena to challenge me.”

Four figures stood up. One each from the Divine Phoenix Mountain, Heavenly Flame Sect, Myriad Lightning Sect, and Divine Dao Pavilion, with fighting spirits blazing within their pupils. But Zhang Ziling flew out before any of them and went to the arena.

“Let us determine this match with one sword,” Lin Yun said.

Zhang Ziling sneered before his gaze became sharp, “I share the same thoughts as well.”

When Ye Qingtian and Zhang Ziling stood in confrontation, Zhang Ziling was the first to draw his sword while Ye Qingtian’s sword was still in the scabbard. Everyone from the Ming Cult saw this scene and couldn’t help becoming excited.

“Zhang Ziling is really strong. As he said, Ye Qingtian cannot draw his sword,” Qu Duan sighed.

In the arena, Lin Yun said, “Don’t shake your head.”

Zhang Ziling sheathed his sword with disdain reflected within his pupils. He didn’t put what Ye Qingtian said in his heart. After sheathing his sword, Zhang Ziling smiled and said, “Ye Qingtian, you’re already dead.”

Zhang Ziling said it so easily with a hint of a smile. His act of shaking his head was also natural, and this scene left everyone present dumbfounded, with their faces becoming white and their souls trembling from what they saw.

Many people covered their mouths with their eyes wide open.

Qu Duan, agitated to go on the stage, fell to the ground, his heart throbbing violently. He clutched his chest with his heart pumping violently.

Li Yanxian already had a speculation, but his cheeks trembled when he saw his scene, and he could feel his legs going soft.

“What’s going on?” Zhang Ziling’s vision suddenly expanded when he saw this scene, and his body became light. It felt as though he was flying, and he could see everyone from the Ming Cult having horror on their faces.

When he finally saw a headless body, he wanted to smile and tell his companions not to be afraid because Ye Qingtian was already dead. But his smile soon froze because that headless body was holding onto his familiar saint sword.

As he bumped gazes with Ye Qingtian, Ye Qingtian said, “I already told you not to shake your head since it’ll fall.”

After Lin Yun spoke, Zhang Ziling’s head rolled on the ground like a ball.

This scene was shocking, and many people couldn’t even see what just happened. They didn’t even see the ray of light from Ye Qingtian’s sword and only saw Zhang Ziling shaking his head by habit in the arena.

It was fine if he didn’t shake his head, but his head fell when he shook. This scene naturally left everyone present deeply shocked. After all, Zhang Ziling’s head suddenly rolled on the ground as he spoke, and no one could see how he died.

The faces of the four geniuses from the six holy lands were ugly, before they sat back down, pretending as if nothing had happened and saw nothing.

“Ye Qingtian, how dare you!” A thunderous roar echoed around the arena as the face of the Ming Cult’s Jiu Yang became ugly.

The man wearing a black hood beside him flew into the arena and made a move, ripping apart the black cloak on him with an azure saint aura spreading out.

“A Quasi-Saint?” Everyone was shocked; their faces changed.

“You’re courting death!” Shi Feng was furious when he saw this scene and wanted to charge into the arena. But Jiu Yang was clearly prepared as he flew over to the Heavenly Dao Sect’s party, his hand falling on Shi Feng’s shoulder.

“Haha! Shi Feng, where do you think you’re going?” Jiu Yang said coldly. “Don’t spoil the rules.”

“Get lost!” Shi Feng couldn’t be bothered to waste saliva with Jiu Yang and pushed his hand forth. Ye Qingtian had proven himself a genius swordsman, and he could imagine how furious the sect would be if Ye Qingtian died here.

“How dare you bring two Quasi-Saints with you! Your Ming Cult is really despicable!” Shi Feng roared.

“The Eastern Desolation no longer belongs to your Heavenly Dao Sect. Then again, no one said Quasi-Saints aren’t allowed to go into the arena,” Jiu Yang sneered.

When Jiu Yang and Shi Feng faced off, a powerful saint aura swept out after three moves, and everyone was sent flying away. There was nothing others could do in a fight between two Quasi-Saints.

Suddenly, an exclamation resounded that piqued everyone’s curiosity. Even the other Quasi-Saints couldn’t be bothered to watch the battle between two Quasi-Saints and turned their attention to the arena with shock on their faces. They couldn’t believe that this was real.

“Elder Shi Feng!” Wang Yue said in a trembling tone. “Senior Brother Ye, he…”

“What’s the matter?” Shi Feng asked anxiously, hoping that Ye Qingtian could hold on longer.

Wang Yue said in disbelief, “Senior Brother Ye… doesn’t seem any weaker than that Quasi-Saint!”

“What?!” Shi Feng was stumped. He couldn’t be bothered with Jiu Yang and quickly turned his attention to the arena. When he looked at the fight on the stage, he was left dumbfounded and couldn’t believe that this was real.
