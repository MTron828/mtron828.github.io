Chapter 557 - Time’s Up

It was easy for Lin Yun to get the second style of the Overlord Sword to lesser mastery. Although it was already terrifying, it wasn’t up to Lin Yun’s standards. It was supposed to be like a bird streaking across the surface of the water to tear it apart. It was the same as trying to sever the sun.

This move had to be quick and unforgettable in order to be like a bird streaking across the surface of the water. As for slashing the sun, it was the momentum of slashing the sun.

Lin Yun thought about it and then opened his eyes. He muttered to himself, “I have to practice my sword somewhere else.”

In the Spiritwood Peak, only the Profound Yin Lake had water, so it was naturally the most suitable place that was nearby. It was only accessible to core disciples, but no one would stop him with his current position.

Two hours later, Lin Yun appeared at the Profound Yin Lake. The surface of the lake was covered in mist and there were many disciples cultivating here. Lin Yun’s appearance naturally attracted everyone’s attention.

“Lin Yun?”

“What is he doing here…” Many people looked at Lin Yun curiously. After all, Lin Yun’s performance in the competition had shocked them.

They watched Lin Yun disappear into the mist with reluctance. After all, it was rude for them to follow him.

“This is a good spot.” Lin Yun nodded his head in satisfaction when he saw that there was no one around him. It really was a good location for him to practice Solar Slash. Standing on the surface of the lake, Lin Yun shut his eyes and recited the Overlord Sword’s mantra in his mind.

His surroundings suddenly became quiet. Previously, he could only hear the water splashing around from the faint breeze, but now that he had calmed down, the noises disappeared. He couldn’t even hear his own heartbeat.

A long time later, Lin Yun opened his eyes and unsheathed the Flower Burial Sword. At the same time, a sword buzz rang out from Lin Yun that resonated with his sword. When Lin Yun swung his sword, it raised a three hundred meters water screen as the torrential sword aura streaked across the surface of the lake and soared.

“So that’s it! In addition to speed, it needs to contain the intent of soaring. I have to gather my origin energy into two sides and swing my sword.” Lin Yun began to swing his sword again and again. Two days passed in the blink of an eye. It was so fast that Lin Yun had forgotten about time because he was cultivating like a maniac.

As Lin Yun swung his sword again, the waves on both sides reached over nine hundred meters in height while Lin Yun soared like a sparrow and his sword ray pierced through the air. When he landed back on the surface of the water, Lin Yun shook his wrist and held the Flower Burial Sword in a reverse grip. “Still not enough.”

The power of the Solar Slash had barely reached greater mastery, but Lin Yun could feel that he was still somewhat lacking. However, he didn’t know where the problem was. Was this move not really able to slash the sun? Was his feeling that he could slash the sun a misperception?

Lin Yun raised his head and saw the sun rising. Suddenly, inspiration appeared in Lin Yun’s mind as his pupils lit up. What would allow this move to slash the sun?

His attack was more than enough to slash the sun, even if it was only for a split second. Furthermore, sunlight traveled over thousands of miles, so nothing was impossible. Perhaps this was what it meant by slashing the sun.

The more Lin Yun thought about it, the more emotional he got. As he circulated the Iris Sword Sutra, his sword aura raised to a terrifying height. Lin Yun’s eyes suddenly lit up as he waved his sword, “This is it!”

A rumbling lightning roared when Lin Yun swung his sword and he raised waves of over three hundred meters on his left and right. The waves were enormous and looked like the wings of a kunpeng. Then, Lin Yun shot out with his sword.

All the light in the path of the sword cracked and the surroundings suddenly plunged into darkness. When sunlight reappeared, Lin Yun was gasping for breath with his forehead covered in sweat. His face was pale, but his eyes were filled with excitement. He finally felt satisfied with the results from Solar Slash. Now, he could bring out 120% of his strength.

He muttered to himself, “There should be three days left until the Five Academies Competition, which should be enough time for me to refine the Yin-Yang Jadecloud Pellet.”

If someone had accomplished what Lin Yun did, they would definitely be overwhelmed by joy. However, Lin Yun’s excitement only lasted briefly before he thought about his next move. Although the Iris Sword Sutra enabled him to fight with geniuses in the lesser Yang stage, Lin Yun still wasn’t satisfied.

Furthermore, the cultivation techniques of those overlord forces’ disciples would definitely be inferior to the Iris Sword Sutra.

“I’ll just refine the pill right here,” sighed Lin Yun as he looked around. He had shined brightly in the competition and received the fourth grade pellet as a reward. Now, it was time for him to refine the pellet that he won.

Without any hesitation, Lin Yun sat down and he opened the delicate box. A surge of chilling air instantly gushed out from the box, making Lin Yun’s face turn pale as ice covering his hair.

“How cold!” Lin Yiun was shocked. He had refined many pellets in the past, but this was the first time he had to use his origin energy to resist the chilling aura coming from a pellet. When he looked at the pellet closely, he could see azure spiritual runes were imprinted on it. They looked like a blue fire as they wandered around the pellet.

Even with his attainment in spiritual runes, he could barely understand this spiritual rune.

“Is this a fourth grade spiritual rune? The dean’s attainment in spiritual rune is really terrifying. It looks like he placed some effort into refining this.” Lin Yun was filled with expectation as he popped the pellet into his mouth.

When the pellet entered his mouth, it immediately dissolved and energy started coursing through his body. He could instantly feel his temperature drop.

Lin Yun clenched his heart as he quickly circulated the Iris Sword Sutra. His silver origin energy began to gush out from his violet palace as it coursed through his veins. It didn’t take long for it to fuse with the pellet’s energy.

Black smoke began to rise up from Lin Yun’s body. It was the impurities leaving his body. As his body continued to release the black smoke, Lin Yun could feel his body getting lighter. Furthermore, his origin energy was even more refined than before.

Lin Yun rejoiced because he never expected that this pellet would remove the impurities in his origin energy and then refine his origin energy. With that, his strength had gotten even more terrifying. He was shocked by the pellet.

The Heavenly Province Academy’s dean wasn’t just the strongest spiritualist in the Nether Prefectural City, but he was ranked in the top ten in the Ancient Southern Domain. In terms of redefining pellets, he was ranked in the top three. This was also partly the reason why Mu Xue was treated so well in the Heavenly Sword Sect.

Three days later, after Lin Yun refined the pellet, his eyes glowed brightly when he opened them. Lin Yun gave off the feeling of a majestic mountain the way that the terrifying aura was released from his body. If a core disciple was here, they would feel pressured.

Lin Yun leaped into the sky. Refining the pellet had given him a pleasant surprise. It didn’t increase his cultivation, but it refined his strength instead. His body was now even lighter than before and he felt like a dragon flying in the sky.

“Time for me to head down the mountain,” smiled Lin Yun as his figure shot out of the lake like an arrow. When the disciples around the lake saw this scene, they all had shock on their faces because they thought that their eyes were messing with them.
