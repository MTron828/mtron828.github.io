Chapter 860 - Never Turn Back!

Shangguan Qinghong’s words instantly aroused Mu Han’s anger. Luckily, Nangong Wanyu reacted in time and quickly stopped his junior brother. There were many elders from the Sacred Alliance staring, so how could they react casually? Furthermore, Mu Han might not be able to defeat Shangguan Qinghong. If that happened, Mu Han would be humiliated.

“Coward,” sneered Shangguan Qinghong with disdain in his eyes. He was angry because of his loss to Lin Yun, so he naturally took advantage of this opportunity to humiliate those from the Ancient Southern Domain.

Shangguan Qinghong smiled with narrow eyes, “The Ancient Southern Domain has been ranked in the bottom for a thousand years now. Calm down, country bumpkin. You’ll soon know how strong the champion of my Mountain Western Domain is!”

Bastard! Mu Han was enraged, but he would fall for Shangguan Qinghong’s trap if he did anything.

When Shangguan Qinghong saw how enraged Mu Han was, he was pleased. After all, there was nothing Mu Han could do. Shangguan Qinghong’s mood had improved after embarrassing Mu Han.

But right at this moment, someone spat on Shangguan Qinghong’s face, which instantly made his face turn dark. He roared, “Who spat on me! Show yourself!”

His roar instantly caused a huge commotion which attracted many people’s gazes. Mu Han and Nangong Wanyu were also stunned and were at a loss.

“Who did it? Come out!” Shangguan Qinghong naturally lost his composure because he had never suffered such humiliation before. The moment he finished yelling, more spit landed on his face, leaving him dumbfounded. When he looked around, he saw a squirrel was spitting on him.

“You bastard, I’ll kill you!” Shangguan Qinghong instantly lost his temper and charged over.

But the squirrel dove into the Mountain Western Domain’s crowd like a bolt of lightning. Occasionally, it would turn back and spit on Shangguan Qinghong’s face again.

In the blink of an eye, Shangguan Qinghong had been toyed with by a demonic beast. The demonic beast was even laughing at him. When Shangguan Qinghong heard the laughter, his face grew even darker.

“Whose pet is that? Hahaha!”

“I think it was Lin Yun’s pet. I saw him carrying it earlier.”

“Haha, this is so funny. Look at Shangguan Qinghong being messed with like an idiot. Not only was he defeated by Lin Yun, but he’s even being bullied by Lin Yun’s pet!” Many people started laughing when they saw Shangguan Qinghong get humiliated.

“Let me see where you’re going to run to now!” Shangguan Qinghong’s face had turned black as he pushed his movement technique to the limit. Seeing that he was going to catch up to Lil’ Red, Lil’ Red moved like a bolt of lightning and landed on Qing Tu’s shoulder. This instantly made Shangguan Qinghong’s face change and quickly stopped. When he saw Lil’ Red’s goofy buck toothed smile, he couldn’t take it anymore.

“Get back here!” Chang Hai roared.

“Elder, that bastard spat on me!” Shangguan Qinghong said with grievance in his voice.

Once Chang Hai heard Shangguan Qinghong’s response, his face turned black, “Get back here! Haven’t you thrown away enough face?!”

Shangguan Qinghong was helpless and he turned back to glare at Lil’ Red. But when he turned around, another mouthful of saliva hit his face.

“Hahaha!” Everyone started laughing when they saw this scene.

Shangguan Qinghong nearly vomited from anger, but he didn’t dare to stay any longer. In the end, his only choice was to leave while Lil’ Red chuckled. Initially, Lil’ Red appeared cute. But when it started to chuckle, it gave everyone an annoyed feeling.

The incident between Shangguan Qinghong and Lil’ Red barely received any attention. After all, everyone was focused on the battle between two champions. Shangguan Qinghong still felt humiliated, but all he could do was push his anger down and wait for Lin Yun to be killed.

Back in the hall, the atmosphere was dense as Lin Yun had returned to his top state. Slowly, his killing aura started to spread out.

“Brat, you don’t seem to be convinced by my words?” Zhong Xuan narrowed his eyes at Lin Yun.

“Brat?” Lin Yun’s brow twitched and he revealed a cold smile, “I don’t like it when people call me that. It doesn’t matter though. Since you failed to kill me, you have no hope of leaving anymore.”

Zhong Xuan’s smile gradually faded and he responded, “I’m actually being underestimated by a brat from the Ancient Southern Domain? It looks like you have no idea what kind of position the Ancient Southern Domain has in the Profound Amber Realm. Let me show you!”

Zhong Xuan floated forward and disappeared into the black mist. As Lin Yun looked around, the black mist spread throughout the entire hall. At this moment, Zhong Xuan’s aura had disappeared.

“Brat, stop looking around. I’m right here!” A voice came from the left. But just when Lin Yun was about to turn around, a bell ring echoed on his right side. Zhong Xuan was underestimating Lin Yun if he thought the same trick would work twice.

Circulating the Azure Firmament Sword Sutra in his body, the Iris Flower petals in Lin Yun’s violet palace suddenly trembled. Immediately, a brilliant sword ring echoed out. When the sound of the sword clashed with the sound of the bell, a terrifying shockwave spread throughout the hall. When the shockwave exploded, Zhong Xuan showed up and his attack enveloped Lin Yun.

“Pitiful tricks!” Lin Yun was already prepared for it and circulated his Cloudsoaring Art. In the blink of an eye, Lin Yun blocked the attack and retaliated with a dozen of his own punches. Every single one of his punches contained boundless Azure Dragon Sword Aura, which forced Zhong Xuan to retreat. When Lin Yun’s punches exploded, Zhong Xuan was sent flying away with shock in his eyes. He clearly never thought that Lin Yun would be so powerful.

Lin Yun sneered as he stepped forward. Seeing Lin Yun charge over, Zhong Xuan smiled weirdly as his body dissipated into the black mist.

“Brat, you’re still too tender!” An eerie laughter echoed behind Lin Yun. It was Zhong Xuan who spread his hand apart as he gathered immense black mist. Soon, the black mist manifested into a glove covered with spikes that emitted an eerie luster.

Not only was the black glove strange, but it also absorbed all the light in the hall and plunged the hall into darkness. Then, Zhong Xuan charged over with an unbelievable speed. His punch was aimed at Lin Yun’s head. If Lin Yun was hit by this attack, there was no question that he would be killed.

But Lin Yun was even faster than Zhong Xuan. He turned around before Zhong Xuan was able to turn into black mist. As Lin Yun’s eyes glowed, he saw through everything clearly even though the fist continued to expand in his eyes.

“Immortal Azure Dragon Sword Aura!” Lin Yun roared, unleashing a sword aura that filled the entire hall. A thirty meter long azure dragon appeared behind him with eyes that radiated brightly and an aura that emitted immortality. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Lin Yun didn’t use his spiritual sword intent, but the Immortal Azure Dragon Sword Aura had already exceeded the scope of the xiantian sword intent. With his sword aura, Lin Yun clenched his fist and threw a punch out at Zhong Xuan’s chest.

Zhong Xuan exclaimed because Lin Yun moved too fast. He was forced to take a few steps back as shock filled his eyes. Is this the spiritual sword intent?

“Spiritual sword intent might be strong, but it won’t be that simple for you to stop me! Fortune martial technique, Heavenly Bell Art!” A ruthless light flashed through Zhong Xuan’s eyes as he pushed his intermediate grade fortune martial technique to the limit. Then, an ancient bell appeared behind him. He used the bell to resist Lin Yun’s Immortal Azure Dragon Sword Aura.

“Fortune martial technique? Is that what you’re relying on?” Lin Yun’s pupils flashed before he roared, “Who said that I was using spiritual sword intent? You’re just a frog in a well!”

When Lin Yun brought out his spiritual sword intent, he didn’t hold back. His aura instantly pierced through the ceiling, causing countless luminous pearls to rain down. At this moment, it looked like the starry sky was broken. Then, an unparalleled aura swept out of Lin Yun’s body as the entire ground shook. It was as if heaven and earth had submitted to Lin Yun’s sword intent. With just a glance, Lin Yun had already pierced through the ancient bell.

“Damn it!” Zhong Xuan’s face changed. Under the immense sword aura, he felt his body becoming stiff.

“Come here!” Lin Yun opened his palm and reached for Zhong Xuan’s neck.

“No, no, no…” Zhong Xuan’s eyes flashed with horror as Lin Yun held his neck.

“I told you, I don’t like it when people call me brat. I especially hate it when it comes from trash like you!” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly as he punched Zhong Xuan.

As Lin Yun’s punch began to expand in Zhong Xuan’s eyes, Zhong Xuan was filled with reluctance. He still had many other techniques, not to mention that he hadn’t even obtained the Heavenly Path quota.

In the next second, Zhong Xuan’s head exploded. Feeling satisfied, Lin Yun tossed Zhong Xuan’s headless corpse to the side. He felt no pity because the martial path was brutal. If he wasn’t ruthless enough, he would be the one lying on the ground.

As a breeze blew past the Profound Amber Mountain, all of the Sacred Alliance’s elders were dumbfounded. Lin Yun had no idea of the shockwaves that his actions created. He simply looked at the bronze gate before him and punched it.
