Chapter 863 - Outcome Determined

Yan Mo’s terrifying attack formed a crimson prison around Lin Yun. At this moment, Lin Yun couldn’t control his killing aura because of the Bloodflame Pupil. The second stage of massacre intent was truly impressive.

“Lin Yun, die! You should be proud, you’re the first person to survive my attacks before I brought out the Bloodflame Pupil.” Looking at Lin Yun’s eyes gradually becoming bloodshot, Yan Mo sneered.

“Hmph, my heart as a swordsman won’t crumble so easily. You have no idea what I’ve experienced!” Lin Yun snorted and started circulating the Azure Firmament Sword Sutra to face Yan Mo’s massacre intent.

Wind and lightning soon enveloped Lin Yun to form a tornado that flickered with lightning. Lin Yun circulated his thunderstorm intent to the limit and tore the incoming crimson radiance into pieces. When Yan Mo’s palm came in contact with the tornado, he was sent flying from a huge explosion.

On the other hand, when Lin Yun circulated his Azure Firmament Sword Sutra, the terrifying ocean of origin energy within his body woke up and started coursing through his body. As boundless azure sword rays exploded, Lin Yun’s clothes fluttered with terrifying lightning crackling.

Whenever the crimson radiance would get near him, it was torn into pieces by the azure sword rays. Yan Mo wiped the corner of his lips with surprise. Just what kind of sword sutra did Lin Yun have that could even cut his massacre intent? In the end, his plan to make Lin Yun lose control of his killing aura had failed.

“Bloodflame Pupil–Demonic Radiance!” Yan Mo’s expression became colder as he formed seals with one hand. The crimson flames in his pupils began to surge, causing the bloodlust around him to condense into droplets of blood. A puddle of blood formed below Yan Mo as he charged at Lin Yun. Empowered by his Bloodflame Pupil, Yan Mo unleashed another attack, “Bloodflame Demonic Radiance!”

“Azure Firmament Flash!” Lin Yun barked and the Azure Firmament Tree appeared behind him as he swung his sword. With this collision, the ground and nearby pillars started to crack. At this point, it felt like the hall would collapse if they continued.

“The pillars cracked!” The faces of Sacred Alliance’s elders changed because they had never seen this before. The construction of the hall was strengthened by spiritual runes that could even defend against a Heavenly Soul Realm expert’s attack.

“Again!” A terrifying light flashed in Yan Mo’s pupils as his massacre intent spread out. Enveloped by the terrifying killing aura, Yan Mo looked like a demonic god from hell.

“Wind Congealing Azure Wood!” Before Yan Mo could attack, Lin Yun swung his sword out once more as the Azure Firmament Tree turned into wisps of sword aura that shred Yan Mo’s killing aura to pieces.

Yan Mo was forced into the air by the sword rays as he threw another punch. With this collision, the pillars gave out and the debris flew across the hall. The flying debris weighed 66 tons each, so they caused a terrifying current in the air.

“Aura Shattering Firmament!” As Lin Yun’s figure flashed in mid-air, he swung his sword out. His boundless sword ray split Yan Mo’s attack in two.

A cloud of dust filled the entire hall after the collision as Yan Mo suddenly descended from the sky. With his fast and bizarre movement technique, he reached for Lin Yun’s head. Those who were watching this scene exclaimed.

Lin Yun maintained his calm. With a single thought, three branches broke off from the Azure Firmament Tree. Pouring the thunderstorm sword energy into his hand, the fine lightning in his palm then turned into an ocean of lightning.

Flicking Divine Finger!

Then, Lin Yun pressed his thumb into his middle finger as he gathered lightning. Before Yan Mo could get close, the sword ray pierced through his right shoulder and knocked him back.

“He avoided it?” Lin Yun was shocked. His Azure Firmament Sword Sutra had reached the sixth stage. Plus, he used three of the Azure Firmament Tree’s branches, which were made of thunderstorm sword energy. Using three branches at the same time was the limit of what Lin Yun could do. However, Yan Mo still managed to dodge the attack.

Since Yan Mo dodged the attack, Lin Yun just had to do it again. Pouring his origin energy into his finger, Lin Yun circulated the Iris Sword Sutra and Azure Firmament Sword Sutra. An azure-purple sword ray exploded out of his body with boundless origin energy.

The Iris Flower petals flew out of his violet palace and formed a gorgeous light screen behind him. A dazzling radiance shined from Lin Yun’s finger, which lit up his face. The power contained in his finger was unbelievable as a sword ray even thicker than the stone pillars caught up to Yan Mo in the blink of an eye.

Vomiting blood, Yan Mo collided against the ceiling with pearls. At this moment, the screen at the top of Profound Amber Mountain crumbled, which caught many people by surprise. They had no idea what was going on in the hall anymore.

“This…”

“Isn’t that sword ray a little too powerful? What a monster!”

“Yan Mo wouldn’t die just like that, right?”

“He shouldn’t. If he couldn’t take the attack, he would have been torn into pieces instead of colliding against the ceiling.”

“That’s right. Since he hit the ceiling, he must have had origin energy that was protecting him. But Lin Yun really has a lot of trump cards. What kind of sword sutra did he cultivate that rendered Yan Mo’s massacre intent useless?” Everyone began to mutter with shock on their faces as they were curious of the outcome.

When Yan Mo fell from the ceiling, his face was nasty because he never expected this scene. “Lin Yun, you’ve truly enraged me!” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Yan Mo’s face was terrifyingly nasty as his eyes nearly burst. Blood began to flow out of his eyes as his aura grew at a shocking speed. Simultaneously, his body withered as his vitality was being drained. This time around, Yan Mo’s blood had formed a pond.

“Die!” With a sinister expression, Yan Mo roared, “Bloodflame Pupil—Light of Annihilation!”

Crimson radiance descended from the sky like rain as Yan Mo soared into the sky and pushed his palm out. A crimson palm slowly appeared in the sky and annihilated all the vitality around it. The palm was covered with spiritual runes, giving off a terrifying fluctuation.

“Azure Firmament Thirteen Sword—Fallen Leaves!” Taking a deep breath, Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with ferocious light. Circulating his Azure Firmament Sword Sutra to the limit, immense azure sword energy poured into the sword in his hand. As an azure radiance burst out of the sword, lightning and wind spiraled around the sword and turned into leaves. When he swung his sword out, countless leaves flew out.

“Azure Firmament Thirteen Sword—Azure Firmament Lightning Tribulation!” There was no change to Lin Yun’s face as he attacked once more. It was terrifying as he poured his origin energy into his sword. A lightning pond appeared in the sky, which slowed the crimson palm from descending.

“Damn it, what sword technique is this?” Yan Mo’s crimson palm began to weaken from the lightning pond while the origin energy protecting him weakened from the leaves.

“Azure Firmament Thirteen Sword—Heavenly Divine Tree Slash!” Raising the Flower Burial Sword, countless leaves began to hover in the sky before creating a complete Azure Firmament Tree above the lightning pond. When the tree circulated, the crimson palm shattered.

At this moment, the outcome had been determined.
