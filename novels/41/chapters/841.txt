Chapter 842 - Thunderstorm Intent

As more people competed, the energy from the Divine Radiantlight Stone fragments grew even stronger, creating different phenomena of wind, fire, lightning, and cloud. Under this situation, it would be dangerous for anyone outside of the top ten to compete for the fragments. However, a dangerous situation wouldn’t stop the greed in everyone’s hearts.

It wasn’t easy for Yu Haotian and the others to obtain the fragments. Because they were under immense pressure, their speed was very slow. Then, Yu Haotian was sent flying, which terrified everyone in the top ten.

The fragments were circling the flag, filling it with a dense dao aura. Additionally, the area around the flag had become a mess of hidden traps. Lin Yun’s gaze was like lightning as he sorted through the fragments with swift decisiveness. With a flash, he drew his sword and shattered a few sinister-looking bolts of lightning.

“Overlord Sword–Thunderbolt Slash!” Lin Yun relied solely on his Iris Sword Sutra, to push the first form of the Overlord Sword to the limit. Raising his hand, 36 bolts of lightning sword rays destroyed the phenomena they came in contact with.

Lin Yun’s wrist trembled and his lightning bolts converged into one gigantic lightning bolt.

“What is that fellow trying to do?” Zhao Wuji’s eyes flickered. His luck wasn’t bad as he had obtained three Divine Radiantlight Stone fragments so far. As for his other two martial intents, he had to focus on them while sorting through the phenomena.

So, Lin Yun’s actions startled him. After all, this wasn’t a test that could be resolved with brute strength. Each phenomenon was extremely complicated due to the leaking dao. Just a moment ago, Yu Haotian was nearly trapped because he wanted to open a path with his Overlord Fist.

In fact, everyone had similar thoughts to Yu Haotian and Lin Yun. There were those who wanted to watch a good show and there were those who had a good relationship with Lin Yun. The latter quickly reminded him of the dangers, but Lin Yun couldn’t be distracted at this moment. Instead, he replied with his actions.

“Break!” When he brought out his spiritual sword intent, he swung his sword out once more. A crack appeared before him and quickly spread out. It didn’t take long for the crack to reach the core region while opening a path for him. As Lin Yun’s eyes flickered, he took nine steps out in mid-air and dashed forward.

“An opportunity!” The eyes of Yu Haotian and Zhao Wuji lit up as they executed their movement techniques to follow Lin Yun. However, the crack closed in a split second and the two were trapped in the quagmire while their movement became stiff.

When they raised their heads, they saw a blurred figure dashing towards the core region.Of course, the figure was Lin Yun.

“Damn it.” Yu Haotian and Zhao Wuji cursed before they quickly backed out.

Zhao Wuji stabilized himself as flames burned on his body. Then, he made up his mind and ignored Lin Yun. “There’s no need for me to compete with him. I only have to bring my lightning intent to the level of spiritual sword intent, so I won’t have to fear him. The fragments I’ve collected are already enough for me.”

As for Yu Haotian, his face was indifferent and no one knew what he was thinking.

In the core region, Lin Yun looked at the fragments in front of him and circulated the spiritual sword intent and Azure Dragon Enneaform to defend himself. The dragon runes that were on the surface of his body left, forming a rope. Empowered by wind and lightning eneries, the rope gathered nearly 100 fragments.

“That’s enough.” Lin Yun nodded his head and called his dragon runes back. With a wave of his hand, he stored all of his fragments while he turned his attention to the flag. The flag was about 10 meters long and had a divine rune embedded in its center. Golden dust fell from the divine rune, making it look special.

Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts because he knew that this flag had transcended the level of cosmic artifacts. He suddenly thought of something and sheathed his sword before tapping his interspatial pouch to retrieve the Indigoflame Thunderwhip. The Indigoflame Thunderwhip was once a dao artifact that swept through the Ancient Southern Domain. However, following the death of Lei Yun’zi, this weapon was sealed. Even now, the seal existed, restricting it to the level of transcendent cosmic artifacts.

“The golden dust must be the dao that Yue Weiwei mentioned. Perhaps I can give it a try.” Lin Yun suddenly had an idea to try. He wanted to see if the Indigoflame Thunderwhip could devour the golden dust to break its seal.

Under Lin Yun’s control, the whip began to burn with purple flames as it twisted through the air like a python. As the golden dust fell onto the whip, the purple flames grew even more ferocious and Lin Yun could sense that the seal was shaking.

Suddenly, a cracking voice sounded out. As the seal broke, Lin Yun sensed that the Indigoflame Thunderwhip had become a lot heavier. While carefully controlling the whip, it suddenly flew out of his hand and towards the mysterious flag. At this moment, it looked like a greedy dragon trying to devour a treat.

Lin Yun’s face changed because the flag was also a dao artifact, albeit a damaged one. As soon as he realized his difficult position, the whip transformed into a flaming dragon that devoured the banner and flew into the horizon.

Did it fly away? Lin Yun’s jaw dropped in disbelief. Raising his head, Lin Yun looked at the long pole that was left behind. Even with Lin Yun’s broad experience, this scene still took him by surprise.

He heard rumors that weapons would leave their owner after growing strong. Did the Indigoflame Thunderwhip think that he wasn’t qualified?

“What a nasty personality.” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed. He had no solution for now and could only put the matter to the side for now. He wasn’t in a rush to leave because the lingering dao aura was a lot stronger than it was outside. First, he protected himself with his sword intent. Then, he sat down to comprehend the wind and lightning intents with the fragments he just obtained.

“It shouldn’t be a big problem.” Lin Yun still hadn’t comprehended the lightning or wind intent. However, he had a deep comprehension of both thanks to the Great Wind Scripture and Overlord Sword. So his cultivation proceeded a lot faster than he expected. In just half an hour, Lin Yun refined dozens of lightning attributed Divine Radiantlight Stone fragments.

Just like that, Lin Yun comprehended the lightning intent and swiftly brought it to greater mastery. Martial intents were divided into nine grades. The first grade of lightning intent was similar to xiantian sword intent, and it was unbelievable that Lin Yun could bring it to greater mastery when he had just started comprehending it.

Then, Lin Yun started to comprehend wind intent. Wind intent couldn’t be seen and was a lot harder to comprehend compared to lightning intent. Even if azure dragons wielded the power to control wind and lightning, he would be lacking if he only comprehended lightning intent. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Four hours later, Lin Yun’s forehead was covered with sweat while his face was pale. However, his eyes were flashing brightly with excitement. Putting both of his fingers together, Lin Yun stabbed his fingers out like a sword that soared into the sky.

The sword ray from his attack pierced through the clouds while lightning crackled and a violent gale blew. At this moment, he successfully comprehended the thunderstorm intent, which perfected his azure dragon aura even more. If he combined it with his spiritual sword intent, it would only become even stronger.

His sword was an azure dragon, and with it, he wielded both wind and lightning. Letting out a sigh, Lin Yun slowly stood up. Although he didn’t make a breakthrough in his cultivation, his fighting prowess had reached a terrifying height.

Then, he turned to the sky to find the Indigoflame Thunderwhip, but it was nowhere to be seen. A brief moment later, Lin Yun retracted his gaze and silently left the core region. The Divine Radiantlight Stone fragments in the outer region had been snatched up by the ten geniuses who were seated on the ground. They were trying to refine the fragments by relying on the lingering dao.

Zhao Wuji had ten fragments around him, five of lightning attribute and five of wind attribute. A terrifying thundercloud intent circulated around him and everyone could sense that he was making swift progress in it.

Sensing Lin Yun’s gaze, Zhao Wuji opened his eyes and looked at Lin Yun with disdain in the depth of his eyes before closing his eyes once more.

Interesting. Looks like he has a decent harvest. Lin Yun commented inwardly before he started to look around. Nangong Wanyu and Mu Han were nervously refining fragments of ice attributes while Bai Lixuan had lightning flickering on the surface of his body.

There were also many people who were kneeling in front of Yu Haotian as he pressured them with his Heavenly Earth Overlord Art. He was forcing them to hand over their Divine Radiantlight Stone fragments.

“Get lost.” Yu Haotian said coldly as he opened his eyes. Everyone felt relieved as the pressure disappeared. Throwing up blood, the crowd felt bitter because their efforts went down the drain.

Then, Yu Haotian turned to look at Lin Yun and snorted. Yu Haotian and Zhao Wuji couldn’t accept their defeat. Now that they had quite the harvest, they stopped concealing their pride.

Suppressing the killing aura in his heart, Yu Haotian left and headed towards the last mountain. It also didn’t take long for Zhao Wuji to open his eyes and look at Lin Yun with a smug face.

“Lin Yun, I told you. Everyone is equal in the Dragoncloud Treasury. We’ll see who ends up benefiting the most.” Zhao Wuji laughed before he headed towards the last mountain as well.

However, Lin Yun didn’t bother them and frowned before looking around to find Yue Weiwei. She was probably already at the last mountain. There might even be a fortune martial technique hidden there since that mountain was the highest.
