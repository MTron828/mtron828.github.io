Chapter 2468 - Yu Qingfeng's Death

Since the Dao Suspend Sword Saint led all the swordsmen present to give him a toast, he would return them with a toast and kept all the petals manifested with sword intent.

The Dao Suspend Sword Saint came to his senses first, and he smiled. He summoned a cup of wine and smiled, “I offer my toast to Flower Burial!”

The other sword saints came to their senses and raised their cups, “We offer our toast to Flower Burial!”

As everyone drank their wine, the event of Lin Yun challenging all the world's swordsmen ended.

Right then, a sword buzz echoed that tore apart the clouds in the sky. The white clothes were like leaves being swept away as two figures soared to the sky, releasing a dazzling white radiance as the thirty-six layers of heaven shattered. The powerful sword intent that they gave off shocked all the swordsmen present.

“They’re finally going to fight!”

“So they have been observing the fight here!”

“They’re going to fight beyond heaven!”

Everyone came to their senses and realized that the two had been observing Lin Yun’s challenge. As for their fight beyond heaven, it was expected.

In reality, Lin Yun and the ten sword saints also held back, or the Skysolute City would’ve been destroyed. As for the Radiant Sword Emperor and Yu Qingfeng, they were seeking dao and wanted to see beyond the ninth-grade sword intent through their fight. They want an answer, won’t stop, and can’t fight on the Heavenly Divine Mountain.

If they fought, they might destroy the Heavenly Divine Mountain, and even the Skysolute City might be caught in their fight. Thus, they could only fight beyond the thirty-six layers of heaven.

Simultaneously, several people emitting an aura in the Emperor Realm also soared to the sky. They were the Emperors of various sects and wanted to observe the fight.

“Master has held the title as Sword Emperor for three thousand years. I won’t if he can keep it this time,” the Dao Suspend Sword Saint said with a grave expression. This was the first and official challenge received by Yu Qingfeng. As for Radiant, he wasn’t an ordinary sword saint either because he was chasing up to the Nine Emperors after reaching the Emperor Realm.

“Even if the Radiant is strong, he has only just become an Emperor. How can he possibly fight Yu Qingfeng?” The Heavenly Plume Sword Saint comforted. The other sword saints also comforted and were optimistic about Yu Qingfeng. They didn’t feel that Radiant could succeed in the challenge.

Hearing that, Lin Yun merely wore a smile. He was also optimistic of Yu Qingfeng, and his master only wanted a fight because of the obsession that lasted for three thousand years. He was seeking an answer.

The Dao Suspend Sword Saint shook his head and sighed, “I know my master’s personality. The title of Sword Emperor was only a title, and he was already tired of it. If someone was willing to bear the responsibility, he would’ve given it away long ago. The title can be a burden to my master...”

The Dao Suspend Sword Saint stopped midway. No one understood better than him that the title was only a restriction on his master.

Lin Yun’s eyes flashed when he heard that and instantly guessed something. The Yu Qingfeng he saw outside Kunlun Realm shouldn’t be the same Yu Qingfeng. That Yu Qingfeng was more youthful, looking like an actual youth.

“It shouldn’t be a simple clone...” Lin Yun pondered to himself. The Yu Qingfeng he saw outside Kunlun Realm might be the real person, and this Yu Qingfeng was a clone. But that was only his speculation because Yu Qingfeng said that he had no opportunities, which Lin Yun didn’t understand.

“Let’s put an end to the gathering today. If all of you are confident, you can watch the battle or stay here,” the Dao Suspend Sword Saint said as the other sword saints flew to the sky before the Dao Suspend Sword Saint could finish. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

But the majority was disappointed because they weren’t strong enough, and they would be caught in the shockwave if they got too close to it. Even so, they would receive a great harvest if they could sense even a ripple of their fight.

“Junior brother, we’re going to observe the fight. Do you want to come with us?” Jian Jingtian came over with the other martial brothers and sisters. They wanted to go, but they were waiting for Lin Yun.

“I’m fine. I have a lot of insight in the previous fight, and I need to digest them,” Lin Yun smiled. Lin Yun needed to digest the insight in his fight with the ten sword saints because his Heavenly Desolate Sword Intent grew stronger. He recalled many of the sword techniques he had forgotten, especially the Divine Firefly Sword. He had far surpassed it and comprehended his own Divine Firefly Sword.

Most importantly, Lin Yun could sense that his sword could connect with the sky. This was a profound sensation because his sword seemed to have turned into the sky when his right hand fell onto his sword, and he could cover the sky with a raise of his hand.

But this wasn’t the reason why he stayed behind. His master was someone Lin Yun respected the most, and he also had a special feeling for Yu Qingfeng, who had been taking care of him. So, whose side was he going to take? Thus, it was best that he didn’t look at the fight.

“Alright. You leave behind.” Ye Guhan and everyone nodded before soaring to the sky. Half of the people soon left on the stage. Most of the swordsmen remaining had their legs crossed and eyes shut to comprehend the shockwave released by the two emperors.

“Lin Yun, who do you think can win this fight?” Lil’ Purple asked.

“Yu Qingfeng. Master can’t win, and I have a foreboding,” Lin Yun replied.

“What do you mean?” Lil’ Purple asked.

“I’m not worried for my master, but...” Lin Yun sighed, raising his head.

“You’re worried about Yu Qingfeng?” Lil’ Purple asked.

Lin Yun nodded upon hearing that.

Lil’ Purple smiled, “You really know how to think. What’s there to worry about Yu Qingfeng? He’s the Sword Emperor. Your master might be strong, but he has only just reached the Emperor Realm. So, how can he injure Yu Qingfeng?”

Lin Yun smiled and said nothing. Everyone felt the same, but when he heard what the Dao Suspend Sword Saint said and Yu Qingfeng he met outside Kunlun Realm, he felt something wasn’t right.

Suddenly, Lin Yun sensed a familiar gaze coming from a veiled woman in the Heavenly Dragon Monastery’s party, about to leave.

Lin Yun was stunned and soared to the sky, blocking the woman with his sword ray. When he saw the eyes behind the veil, he smiled and raised his hand to stop her. He smiled, “Senior Sister, you’re ruthless to say nothing when you come.”

This woman might’ve covered herself completely, but Lin Yun instantly recognized her.

Removing her veil, Xin Yan smiled, “I have gone to seek my Buddhist fortune. I heard about this gathering in the Western Desert and came to take a look. You’ve achieved it.”

“Big Sister Xin Yan, I knew it was you,” Lin Yun smiled.

“I’ll take my leave now. Someone is waiting for me,” Xin Yan smiled, and her smile was pure.

Taking a deep breath, Lin Yun looked at Xin Yan, “Buddhist fortune? Where is it?”

“It should be outside Kunlun Realm. If the Heavenly Path is reforged, we will meet again, just like how we reunited after parting in the Profound Amber Realm,” Xin Yan said.

Lin Yun was filled with emotions as he clasped his hands together and bowed. He was happy that Xin Yan could receive this opportunity, not to mention that she came upon hearing about him. This meant that he had a spot in her heart, and their relationship wouldn’t break just because of Buddhist fortune.

“Junior Brother, take care of yourself, and I will wait for you.” Xin Yan stepped forward to give Lin Yun a hug; she knew that Lin Yun had something more important to do.

Watching Xin Yan leave, it took a while before Lin Yun calmed his emotions.

“Hmph.” Lil’ Purple snorted.

Lin Yun smiled, “Let’s go and find a place for me to go into seclusion for a few days.”

Lin Yun found an inn in the Skysolute City and went into the Iris Secret Realm to cultivate. His potential was further excavated after fighting with ten sword saints. His strength was infinitely close to Emperors. If he had used the Iris Sword Box and Sovereign Divine Runes, ordinary Emperors might not have been able to defeat him.

The fight between Radiant and Yu Qingfeng lasted for seven days and nights.

In the Iris Secret Realm, Lin Yun’s Heavenly Desolate Sword Intent improved after stabilizing his cultivation in the pinnacle of Boundless Stage. He took papers and a brush to write down all the sword techniques he recalled. Even those cultivation techniques he practiced in the past were recalled, but the power had undergone a drastic transformation.

Even so, it wasn’t enough for the current him. But he still wrote them down as a record. He had a thought, which was to leave behind some inheritances if he left Kunlun Realm one day for the future generation, just like how he obtained those inheritances when he was an insignificant youth in the past.

Back then, Lin Yun’s greatest regret was the Overlord Sword. The Overlord Sword didn’t have a sword sutra that came along with it, but it was perfected now.

After the Radiant and Yu Qingfeng finished their battle, all the swordsmen returned to the Skysolute City with disbelief on their faces. They didn’t see the outcome clearly and didn’t tell who won.

When the Ice Emperor descended on the campsite of the Frostsnow Sacred Palace, the Chill Cloud Sword Saint came forward to bow and asked about the outcome of the battle. Aside from sword saints, the battle between Radiant and Yu Qingfeng also attracted many Emperor Realm experts, and the Ice Emperor was one of them.

The Ice Emperor sighed, “No one lost, and no one won. From today onwards, the Sword Emperor won’t be Yu Qingfeng but Radiant.”

“Why?” The Chill Cloud Sword Saint was baffled.

“No why. The Sword Emperor is a title and responsibility. Yu Qingfeng held it for three thousand years and has been protecting the Ancient Barren Domain. Now, Radiant would take over the responsibility to protect Kunlun Realm and fight when the Heavenly Path is reforged,” the Ice Emperor said.

That might be a fight between Yu Qingfeng and Radiant, but it was also an inheritance from Yu Qingfeng, passing down his understanding of sword dao to the latter. At the same time, they used their strongest attacks, hoping to see beyond the ninth-grade sword intent.

But it was a pity that they only saw a wisp of light, the Sword Dao sealed behind Heavenly Dao. In the end, Yu Qingfeng charged over and finally opened a small crack, allowing the radiance behind the gate to shine on him. But Yu Qingfeng also paid the price and was saved by Radiant.

That was the scene that the Ice Emperor saw, and he didn’t know about the exact situation. He sighed, “Yu Qingfeng is going to die soon...”

“What?” The Chill Cloud Sword Saint was shocked.

Three days later, the news that Yu Qingfeng was about to die spread throughout Skysolute City, shocking everyone. The Dao Suspend Sword Saint also announced that Yu Qingfeng wanted to see Lin Yun before his death on the condition that he could climb the Heavenly Divine Mountain.
