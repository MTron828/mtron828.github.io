Chapter 565 - Topple

Everyone looked at Lin Yun with shock in their eyes. No one thought that Lin Yun could defeat Jiang Yi, who brought out the Primal Chaos Nine Transformation. Furthermore, Jiang Yi was the one who surrendered. They were still captivated by the grace of Lin Yun’s fight and they couldn’t gather themselves.

Everyone from the Heavenly Province Academy, except for the bitterly smiling Mu Xue, had joy on their faces. Lin Yun’s last sword not only defeated Jiang Yi, but it also dealt Mu Xue a slap on the face and destroyed all her pride.

So what if she was from an overlord force? Even Jiang Yi, who was ranked among the Cloud Trigram Sect’s top ten inner disciples, had admitted defeat. The sad truth was that she wasn’t any stronger than Jiang Yi.

“I nearly forgot that he’s also a swordsman,” smiled Liu Yunyan as she recalled how mighty Lin Yun looked back at the Indigocloud Lake with his Flower Burial Sword.

“We were right,” chuckled Tang Yu as he stroked his beard. He was one of those who supported Lin Yun. Now that Lin Yun had revealed his strength, none of those elders who were against it could utter a word.

“That fellow is a little terrifying.” Chen Yu of the White Jade Academy had shock on his face. Aside from him, the youth carrying the greatsword, Luo Shen, was most shocked. Before he joined the White Jade Academy, he had suffered a huge loss in the hands of a Cloud Trigram Sect’s disciple and nearly died. But he never thought that Lin Yun could force Jiang Yi into admitting defeat.

“I’ve never heard of him. Where did he come from?”

“The Heavenly Province Academy really invited a strong helper this time.” The White Jade Academy’s elders all wore a grave expression. They never imagined that the Heavenly Province Academy would be their strongest opponent besides the Violethut Academy.

But since it was only Lin Yun, they weren’t too worried about it. After a brief discussion, Cao Xiu’s eyes flashed coldly and he sneered, “Leave that brat to me. I can use him to practice my skills before challenging Cao Zhen.”

Lin Yun raised his head and saw that Jiang Yi had already dispelled the Primal Chaos Art and was left with a pale face. Jiang Yi was greatly shocked by Lin Yun’s sword and he was wondering what would have happened to him if Lin Yun aimed that sword at him.

Thinking about how he confidently asked Lin Yun to surrender, he instantly felt awkward. He smiled bitterly, “You are exactly the way that your friend described you. You’re not someone to be underestimated.”

Although Jiang Yi never underestimated Lin Yun, he still faced Lin Yun with pride as a genius from an overlord force. Then again, he couldn’t be blamed for it since the nine overlord forces were giants in the Ancient Southern Domain. Wherever these disciples went, they would receive respect. Pride had already taken root in Jiang Yi’s bones and it couldn’t be changed.

Lin Yun didn’t hate Jiang Yi as the latter faced him openly. However, he was curious about the ‘friend’ mentioned by Jiang Yi. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“You want to know who that friend of yours is, right?” Jiang Yi smiled. “I can’t tell you, but I can tell you that this person has been thinking about you. He’s quickly growing strong and was taken in as a personal disciple of a great figure the moment he joined.”

“I’ll wait for him,” said Lin Yun. There was nothing he could do except wait. After all, he would eventually find out during the Draconic Banquet.

“I believe the Heavenly Province Academy invited you to deal with Cao Zhen, but you should also be careful of the White Jade Academy. Cao Xiu isn’t an easy opponent and you won’t make it out if you’re careless,” smiled Jiang Yi as he cupped his hands together and left.

Lin Yun fell into deep thought because Jiang Yi didn’t seem to place the Flowing Cloud Academy in his eyes. Was he so sure that the White Jade Academy could defeat the Flowing Cloud Academy?

Lin Yun raised his head to look at the Violethut Academy’s Cao Zhen who was meditating with his eyes closed. He didn’t seem to have any intention of opening his eyes. It seemed like he didn’t care who his opponent was. In fact, the entire Violethut Academy was also calm and composed.

Is Cao Zhen really as terrifying as the rumors? Lin Yun collected his thoughts and returned to his seat.

“Thank you,” smiled Tang Yu as he stood up with Mo Ling and the rest. They had great respect for him. After all, it was thanks to Lin Yun that they could win this battle so beautifully.

“Congratulations. I admit that I’ve made a mistake,” said Mu Xue as she came over.

Lin Yun rubbed his nose and smiled, “No worries. I knew you would admit it.”

Mu Xue glared at Lin Yun, “You’re really as arrogant as ever. But I don’t hold it against you since you defeated Jiang Yi.”

Mo Ling smiled, “Alright, it’s time for the Flowing Cloud Academy and White Jade Academy to fight. If nothing goes wrong, there’s a high chance that the White Jade Academy will win.”

Everyone from the Heavenly Province Academy looked at the stage with seriousness. The White Jade Academy was a powerful enemy that stood in their way.

Mo Ling spoke with a grave expression, “Cao Xiu from the White Jade Academy is strong, not to mention that there’s also Luo Shen. One is a monstrous genius from the Blackflame Sect, while the other is a wandering cultivator that they groomed. Plus, we know nothing about Luo Shen.”

Luo Shen? That weird youth with the greatsword? Lin Yun turned to look in Luo Shen and Cao Xiu’s direction.

“They’re really not easy to deal with…” Lin Yun muttered to himself. He could tell that the two were at least on the same level as Jiang Yi. In fact, Cao Xiu might be even stronger than Jiang Yi. Otherwise, Jiang Yi wouldn’t be so wary of him.

A brief moment later, the battle between the White Jade Academy and Flowing Cloud Academy began. The White Jade Academy sent out Luo Shen for the first battle and he walked out with an oversized greatsword. Because of the size, the crowd wondered if Luo Shen could really swing it.

The outcome of the battle had shocked everyone. Not only was Luo Shen able to swing his sword, but the sword moved with great agility under his control. Every strike made the Flowing Cloud Academy’s participant’s face turn ugly as if he was suffering great pain.

Five moves later, the participant from the Flowing Cloud Academy was sent flying. When he landed on the ground, he could no longer get up and his face was pale.

Everyone was shocked by how quickly this battle ended. The faces of the Heavenly Province Academy’s party also became grave as Mo Ling spoke out, “This must be a chess piece purposely groomed by the White Jade Academy. His fighting style is weird, so you’ll lose if you can’t take his first attack.”

Mo Ling managed to piece some clues together from the fight.

Lin Yun nodded his head in agreement. In his eyes, it was a pity that the battle ended too quickly because he could have observed Luo Shen even more.

The second battle was surprising because the White Jade Academy sent out Chen Yu instead of Cao Xiu. Going by Mo Ling’s information, Chen Yu was probably the weakest from the White Jade Academy.

This also made many people surprised because no one expected that the White Jade Academy would send out Chen Yu to deal with a disciple of an overlord force. But the most conservative method was to use the weakest in the team to exhaust the other party’s strongest fighter. With Cao Xiu last, it was practically destined that the White Jade Academy would win.

But the outcome had shocked everyone once more. The ‘weakest’ among the three actually defeated the Flowing Cloud Academy’s helper.

“The White Jade Academy is a little too terrifying.”

“The weakest Chen Yu is actually so powerful? Don’t forget that there’s still Cao Xiu.”

“The White Jade Academy seems to be going after the championship. Who knows, they might even snatch it from the Violethut Academy.”

“Haha, this is interesting. It’ll be even more difficult for the Heavenly Province Academy to retain that incomplete divine rune.” The spectators became even more excited when they saw this. They could imagine the ferocious battle between the Heavenly Province Academy and White Jade Academy.

After Chen Yu defeated his opponent, he looked at Lin Yun eerily. He raised his brow with an eerie smile filled with provocation.

“This is going to be difficult…” Tang Yu wore a grave expression. Neither Mo Ling nor Liu Yunyan uttered a word.

A grave atmosphere slowly spread out in the Heavenly Province Academy, washing away the joy from Lin Yun’s victory. They expected the White Jade Academy to be strong, but not this strong.

Even the confident Mu Xue became silent because she knew that her odds of beating Chen Yu or Luo Shen was lower than 60%.

The morale among the Heavenly Province Academy began to topple at this moment because they couldn't afford another loss.
