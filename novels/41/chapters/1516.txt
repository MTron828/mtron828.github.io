Chapter 1517 - I Have A Sword, Heaven Sword Form!

Tian Jue was shocked beyond words when he saw the Creation Pellet. This pellet should be called the Divine Dragon Creation Pellet, instead.

But when Tian Jue saw Lin Yun, he soon hid his emotions but had shock in his pupils. He found this person to be familiar, and it took some time before he was sure that this person was Lin Yun. But he was shocked Lin Yun could make it to the eighth level.

When he saw Lin Yun had no intentions of leaving, Tian Jue shifted his gaze from the pellet and wore a playful smile, “What’s the matter? You want to compete with me for the pellet?”

“I can’t?” Lin Yun replied calmly.

“Hahaha!” Tian Jue laughed with mockery in his pupils. “I advise you to think it through before I make my move. It’s not easy for you to come this far, and I can pretend that you never existed if you get down on your knees. Otherwise, I don’t mind ending your life here and now!”

He was already giving Lin Yun some face. But he couldn’t be blamed for being ruthless if Lin Yun didn’t appreciate it.

“Come at me, then.” Lin Yun couldn’t be bothered to waste time talking to Tian Jue.

“How stubborn. Do you really think you can compete with me for the Creation Pellet?!” Tian Jue’s face sank before flying into a rage. In his view, Lin Yun was really courting death to dare to challenge him when he was so cowardly back then.

When Tian Jue let out a ferocious roar, dazzling lightning exploded from him that manifested into a long blade was swung down. When the lightning exploded in the hall, Lin Yun unleashed his sword intent, instantly leaving holes in the lightning.

But that wasn’t all, a dragon roar echoed while being accompanied by saintly music in the next second. It sounded like an ancient war song as a draconic aura radiated from Lin Yun, before he punched the lightning blade.

When the lightning dissipated, Tian Jue pointed with his finger, unleashing a gigantic finger covered with lightning saint runes. In the path of that finger, the surrounding space began to shatter. Tian Jue was the first envoy and was a lot stronger than those Lin Yun had fought in the past.

But that wasn’t an issue for him. After he landed on the ground, nine thousand dragon runes appeared on his body before pouring into his right hand. When he opened his right hand, his fingers were like dragon claws with violent storms gathering and reaching a terrifying height.

Just like that, Lin Yun’s dragon claw tore that gigantic finger into pieces. But that wasn’t all, Lin Yun roared, “I’ll return you with a palm, then!”

His palm was like a dragon claw that was descending from the sky, making Tian Jue furrow his brows. He naturally recognized that Lin Yun had practiced a Dragon Clan’s body-refining technique. But flames soon blazed in his pupils because he realized Lin Yun was a little troublesome.

But it was nothing before him. He clasped his hands together. When an ocean of lightning appeared beneath his fet, Tian Jue waved his hand before the terrifying phenomena, and the raging ocean surged forth.

Like that, the dragon claw and lightning ocean collided, like two dragons letting out ferocious roars. As the dragon roar and rumbling thunder echoed, the spacious hall became filled with the phenomena created by Lin Yun and Tian Jue. In the blink of an eye, they had exchanged over ten-odd moves.

Tian Jue was inwardly shocked and couldn’t believe this was happening. He couldn’t believe someone at the six-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm could fight him. He soon realized that Lin Yun had reached the seven-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm. But even so, there was a difference of a star between them. To a monstrous genius, the difference between a star could be fatal in a fight.

“Sky Shattering Lightning Dragon!” Tian Jue roared, and the eight stars in his violet palace lit up. The aura he gave off rapidly increased and soon reached eight folds. He wanted to use the advantage in his cultivation to quickly put an end to Lin Yun because he couldn’t obtain any benefit in terms of techniques or martial intent.

But Lin Yun smiled when he saw this scene. Tian Jue was naive, wanting to suppress him by using the advantage of his cultivation. Once he activated all the astral energy within the ocean in his violet palace, starlight soon filled his body, and the light was being emitted from his pores. After he was basked in golden light, a Netherworld Flower with twelve petals appeared behind him.

Blood dripped down from the corner of Tian Jue’s lips as he was sent flying away. When he collided with the wall, his face instantly became pale, and he couldn’t believe that he had lost when competing in cultivation. This immediately made him wonder what kind of monster Lin Yun was as he looked at him in disbelief.

“Who the hell are you?!” Tian Jue roared. “You’re name is definitely not Lin Tian!”

“Ha!” Lin Yun laughed, but he had no intention of telling Tian Jue his identity. What could Tian Jue do even if he refuses to tell him?

But his snicker had thoroughly enraged Tian Jue. Waving his hand, the twenty thousand rune saint artifacts appeared in his hand. This was the inheritance saint artifact of the Heavenly Astral Pavilion—Heavenly Feather Blade!

“I’ll make you speak!” Tian Jue’s eyes coldly flashed, and he drew his blade with a terrifying blade intent unleashed from him. That was his firmament blade intent. Not only did Tian Jue’s lightning intent reach the fourth grade, but his blade intent as well. Otherwise, it would make no sense that he could compete with the chief disciples of the other six demonic sects.

“Rising Moon!” As Tian Jue’s astral energy radiated, he swung his blade down. When he swung his blade, a moon rose from the lightning ocean, a purple moon condensed with lightning. When his boundless blade intent enveloped Lin Yun, he was instantly restricted.

This blade was too terrifying, and even Lin Yun was caught by surprise. Although he took several steps back, he still couldn’t avoid this attack. When the blade ray landed on Lin Yun, it instantly shattered three thousand of the dragon runes with sparks flying around.

“End of the World!” Before Lin Yun could react, a mountain rose from the lightning ocean with a purple moon hanging above it. While Tian Jue basked in the moonlight, the attack he unleashed was too fast, and Lin Yun believed that this attack could sever a mountain that was a hundred miles away in the outside world.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

When three thousand more dragon runes shattered, Lin Yun threw out a small mouthful of blood, and his face became pale. That attack was too quick, and he didn’t even have the time to react. As he retreated while taking the huge blow, the remaining three thousand dragon runes had already dimmed.

“Heavenly Feather!” Tian Jue unleashed another attack just when Lin Yun regained his footing. His boundless blade instant instantly immobilized Lin Yun.

“You can be proud that you forced me to draw my blade and made me use my three strongest attacks. You can die now!” When Tian Jue was done, the terrifying blade ray flew out a with terrifying momentum.

When the remaining three thousand dragon runes shattered, crimson flames blazed on Lin Yun, and the crimson flames only blazed for a brief moment. But when the sword was about to land on Lin Yun, a pair of Golden Crow Wings unfolded behind him, and the twenty thousand saint runes were instantly activated.

When the Heavenly Feather Blade landed on the Golden Crow Wings, sparks flew as the wings folded together. The next second, the twenty thousand saint runes lit up, and Tian Jue was sent flying away. This made Tian Jue furrow his brows with doubt flashing through his pupils.

His attack should have killed Lin Yun, but he didn’t expect him to still have a trump card. But it no longer mattered. He was confident that no one could survive his three attacks; even if they could, he could just unleash another attack should anyone survive his third attack.

“I’ve not used my sword. So where did you get the confidence that you’ve won?” As the Golden Crow Wings unfolded, Lin Yun’s azure clothes began to flutter under the wind. He was already grabbing a hold of the Flower Burial Sword. His temperament had undergone a drastic transformation just by gripping the sword hilt.

Tian Jue was immediately sent flying away by Lin Yun’s aura. Every time Tian Jue stepped back, he would throw out a mouthful of blood with his face distorted by pain. When Lin Yun drew his sword, a sword vibration echoed.

“I have a sword, the Heaven Sword Form! So please experience it well!” Lin Yun waved his hand and his firmament sword intent swept out. Thirty-six sword rays then intertwined to form a ‘heaven’ word.

He was paying Tian Jue back with the same method, it’s just that his sword was faster and more ruthless. His sword ray quickly pierced through Tian Jue’s saint armor, immediately destroying it before his sword stabbed into Tian Jue’s chest by half an inch.

But Tian Jue’s hands firmly stopped the sword from proceeding any further, with blood dripping down from his palms. After Tian Jue took three steps back, his back was in direct contact with the wall.

Tian Jue took a deep breath before throwing out another mouthful of blood. His blood was like an arrow aimed at Lin Yun’s face. But Lin Yun quickly retreated and raised his sword to block the blood arrow since he could feel a fatal threat from this attack, which meant that there must be something special about it.

“Ha!” Tian Jue took this opportunity to quickly crawl out of the hall without even daring to turn his head around.

“He’s swift at running away.” Lin Yun sheathed his sword and chose not to chase after Tian Jue. It wasn’t because he purposefully spared Tian Jue, but the creation pellet was of utmost importance.

Aside from that, his injuries weren’t light since all nine thousand dragon runes were shattered, and he had never suffered such grave injuries ever since he entered the Dragon Remnant Astral Realm. If he chased after Tian Jue, someone might take the creation pellet, which meant that he would have to face the chief disciples of the other demonic sects.

But Tian Jue could be considered a ruthless person. This made Lin Yun fall into deep thoughts because it wouldn’t be an easy battle if Tian Jue didn’t underestimate him right from the start. Just Tian Jue was already so powerful, and this only meant that the chief disciples of the other demonic sects were no pushovers.
