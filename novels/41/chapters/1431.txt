Chapter 1432 - Jian Clan

The Radiant Sword Saint saw him before in the Profound Amber Realm? Lin Yun looked at the Radiant Sword Saint with a huge question mark above his head.

Seeing the doubt in Lin Yun’s eyes, the Radiant Sword Saint smiled, “Perhaps I wasn’t clear with what I said. I only saw you from afar, but I’ve remembered you ever since then.” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“What do you mean?” Lin Yun was still puzzled.

The Radiant Sword Saint briefly pondered before he asked, “Do you remember that immortal sword ray when your xiantian sword intent reached the spiritual sword intent?”

“The one left by the founder of the Sword Firmament Pavilion, Jian Wuming…” Lin Yun exclaimed.

“I was the one who left it behind,” smiled the Radiant Sword Saint.

“Y-Y-You’re Jian Wuming!” Lin Yun exclaimed with disbelief because this was too incredible. It turned out that the founder of the Sword Firmament Pavilion was the famous Radiant Sword Saint in the Divine Dragon Era. But it made sense since the Sword Firmament Pavilion had its inheritance from the Southern Domain’s Sword Sect. But after the Sword Sect was destroyed, Jian Wuming brought the Sword Sect’s inheritance to the Great Qin Empire and established the Sword Firmament Pavilion.

“The Lower Realm’s Sword Sect and the Kunlun Realm’s Sword Sect?” Lin Yun suddenly figured something out. Back in the ruins of the Profound Amber Realm’s Sword Sect, he also heard the same oath: Eight thousand years of reign with our halo enveloping ninety thousand miles. As long as the moon exists, the Sword Sect never dies!

“That’s right.” The Radiant Sword Saint calmly said. “Back when the Sword Sect was at its peak, there were many branches in the lower realms, and geniuses from the lower realms could even directly enter the Kunlun Realm. But after the two peaks were destroyed three thousand years ago, the lower realms’ Sword Sects began to crumble. This includes the Profound Amber Realm’s Sword Sect. I wanted to preserve the legacy and established the Sword Firmament Sect before I traveled around the Profound Amber Realm and ultimately came to the Kunlun Realm.”

“Disciple Lin Yun greets the ancestor!” Lin Yun couldn’t help bowing once more in excitement.

“Haha, there’s no need for that. You’re my disciple now, so you can just call me Master.” The Radiant Sword Saint heartily laughed.

Despite what the Radiant Sword Saint said, Lin Yun couldn’t contain his emotions. But his eyes suddenly flickered and asked, “Then… has Lord Thirteenth and the old Pavilion Master been to the Sword Sect?”

He never forgot about Jian Shisan and Jian Xuanhe, who helped him immensely in the past. They selflessly helped him when he was in need. So they were benefactors that he would never be able to forget in his entire life.

“They did. But they’re orphans of the Jian Clan and went to look for the ancestral ground.” The Radiant Sword Saint smiled.

“Jian Clan?” Lin Yun was surprised before he fell into deep thoughts. He suddenly recalled everyone with the surname ‘Jian’ that he had come across, Jian Wuya, Jian Wuming, Jian Xuanhe, Jian Shisan, and Jian Jingtian. He had a feeling that the Jian Clan had a vast origin.

“That’s right. The Jian Clan was one of the eight ancient imperial clans. But after the ancient battle of gods, they were nearly destroyed, and only some orphans were left behind. Furthermore, the surname ‘Jian’ only passes down to the males, not females…” The Radiant Sword Saint explained.

“But why are they looking for the ancestral ground if everything is destroyed?” Lin Yun was still puzzled.

“It might be destroyed, but the ancestral ground is still around. It’s just that not everyone can find it. Only those who possess the imperial bloodline can find it. They came to the Kunlun Realm to find their roots, so I naturally gave them some clues.” The Radiant Sword Saint replied.

“Master, does that mean that my senior brother, Jian Jingtian, is also from the Jian Clan?” Lin Yun suddenly asked.

“That’s for sure.” The Radiant Sword Saint’s had a grave expression before he sighed. “Not just anyone can take on the ‘Jian’ surname. Rather than orphans, we prefer to call ourselves ‘the forgotten’ as we’re just a group that people have forgotten.”

Lin Yun no longer asked about it; he could tell that his master didn’t have much sentimentality towards the Jian Clan.

“So when you comprehended the spiritual sword intent through the sword intent that I left behind, I also saw you through my sword intent. This is my third time seeing you, and the fate between us has long been set.” The Radiant Sword Saint continued.

Lin Yun only managed to calm down after hearing that. It was unbelievable that such a legendary person was standing before him. But Lin Yun thought of something and asked, “But Master… I heard that you only have five years left in your lifespan…”

“Who said that? Yu Qingfeng?” The Radiant Sword Saint asked with a playful smile.

Sure enough, the Radiant Sword Saint and Tian Xuanzi had noticed who possessed him back then. But the Radiant Sword Saint didn’t shy from the topic regarding his lifespan and replied, “He’s not exactly wrong.”

The Radiant Sword Saint’s acknowledgment caused huge waves to bellow in Lin Yun’s heart. He hesitated for a brief moment before taking out the Divine Blood Fruit without hesitation. “Master, I wonder if this Divine Blood Fruit can help you?”

It was the Divine Blood Fruit that Lin Yun obtained back on the Heavenly Path. It was extremely precious, according to Yue Weiwei. Even saints couldn’t resist them because it could boost their cultivation and increase their lifespan, if Lin Yun had guessed it right.

“Nine-Leaf Divine Blood Fruit!” The Radiant Sword Saint was surprised to see what Lin Yun took out. It wasn’t because he was shocked by the Divine Blood Fruit but by Lin Yun’s actions. This was only their second meeting, and Lin Yun had no qualms about offering it to him. Lin Yun should know how precious the Nine-Leaf Divine Blood Fruit was.

“Do you know what this is?” The Radiant Sword Saint asked as he looked at Lin Yun.

“The Divine Blood Fruit, one that can increase a saint’s lifespan.” Lin Yun nodded.

The Radiant Sword Saint was briefly stunned before he smiled, “Put it away. I could have accepted it if you had offered it to me ten years ago. But I have already refined a Divine Blood Fruit, so this is no longer effective on me. It doesn’t matter, either way. If I can’t take that step out, no medicine or elixir can help me. You don’t have to grieve for me because I had a wonderful life, and everyone’s life will eventually end.”

Lin Yun couldn’t help feeling melancholy upon hearing that the Divine Blood Fruit was useless.

“Besides, who can be sure that I won’t be able to make a breakthrough in five years?” The Radiant Sword Saint smiled with pride flashing across his pupils. This was his pride as a swordsman.

Seeing this, Lin Yun had no choice but to stow the Divine Blood Fruit.

Looking at Lin Yun, the Radiant Sword Saint solemnly said, “I have to primarily be in seclusion for the next five years. But since I’ve taken you in as a disciple, I will naturally fulfill my obligations. You can come here once every six months. But before you reach the Dragon Pulse Realm, I won’t teach you any other martial techniques. Now, show me the sword techniques that you’re most proficient in.”

The sword techniques he was most proficient in? His strongest and most proficient sword techniques should be the Aquaheaven Sword Technique and Carefree 9 Swords. The other sword techniques could no longer keep up with his current strength.

In addition, there were a few other secret techniques that he could show the Radiant Sword Saint. However, Lin Yun was too embarrassed to perform sword techniques that were too unrefined in front of the Radiant Sword Saint.

“This is the Aquaheaven Sword Technique. Please take a look at it, Master.” Lin Yun bowed before he drew his sword and demonstrated the Aquaheaven Sword Technique in this peach blossom forest. This sword technique contained thirty-six intents, and Lin Yun had mastered them all. So it didn’t take long for him to perform the entire sword technique.

The Radiant Sword Saint carefully watched Lin Yun’s demonstration. When Lin Yun was done, he asked, “Not bad. Anything else?”

Nodding his head, Lin Yun used his sword as a brush and performed the Carefree 9 Swords—Heavenly Sword Form. After thirty-six strokes, a word appeared in this peach blossom forest that brought the power of his firmament sword intent to the limit.

“Anymore?” The Radiant Sword Saint asked, and his eyes were glowing brighter than before.

Lin Yun briefly pondered before demonstrating the Flicking Divine Finger and the Sword of the Beginning. Those two couldn’t be considered sword techniques but secret techniques, since Lin Yun rarely used them in battles.

“That’s enough.” The Radiant Sword Saint nodded, indicating that Lin Yun could stop now.

“Let’s start with the Aquaheaven Sword Technique.” The Radiant Sword Saint briefly pondered before he continued, “This is a portion of a ghost spirit martial technique, and I can sense that you can only summon the holy spirit after mastering the thirty-six intents. This sword technique has a total of one hundred and eight phenomena. I’ll demonstrate it for you, so watch carefully.”

Grabbing a tree branch using suction force, the Radiant Sword Saint used it as a sword and took a step forth. He then divided it into one hundred and eight afterimages. Whenever his afterimages used a sword, there would be a white dragon that coiled around it.

When all his afterimages combined, a white dragon with a length of three hundred meters was formed. Not only was it massive, there was even a blood mark on its forehead. This mark gave the white dragon a touch of divinity, allowing the divine dragon’s aura to reach a terrifying height. Aside from that, the dragon claws were enveloped in a white light that could easily tear the sky apart.

The Radiant Sword Saint tapped out and a white light entered Lin Yun’s mind, instantly imprinting the hundred and eight phenomena within his mind so that he wouldn’t forget it.

“Your second sword technique should be the Carefree 9 Swords from the Southern Emperor. You must’ve gotten his inheritance on the Profound Wither Island, right?” The Radiant Sword Saint recognized the Carefree 9 Swords as he continued, “But your Heavenly Sword Form is obviously more inferior than the Aquaheaven Sword Technique.”

But Lin Yun was surprised to hear that. He had already brought the Heavenly Sword Form to the manifestation stage, and he had been practicing it for much longer than the Aquaheaven Sword Technique. But the Radiant Sword Saint said that his Heavenly Sword Form was inferior to the Aquaheaven Sword Technique?

“You don’t believe my words?” The Radiant Sword Saint smiled.

Lin Yun thought about it for a while before he nodded, “Indeed, I can’t believe it. Please clarify it, Master.”
