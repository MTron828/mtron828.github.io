Chapter 659 - The Gathering's Qualification

Lil’ Red was enveloped in a crimson cocoon, like a caterpillar transforming into a butterfly. The crimson cocoon had completely sealed Lil’ Red without a trace of its aura leaking out.

From where Lin Yun was standing, he could hear a powerful heartbeat from the cocoon that made his gaze become grave. The entire world had become quiet and only the powerful heartbeat could be heard. He had a feeling that a powerful aura was being accumulated in the cocoon.

Suddenly, Lin Yun squinted his eyes as the crimson cocoon split apart. Under his surprised gaze, the cocoon broke into pieces and a surging demonic aura soared into the sky. Under the demonic aura, the clouds began to surge violently.

Lin Yun squinted his eyes to look for Lil’ Red. Its glossy fur looked like crimson crystals. Additionally, there were a few patches of silver hair on its back that looked like runes emitting an ancient aura.

“Looks like this fool’s bloodline has awakened a little more,” sighed Lin Yun as Lil’ Red’s faint dragon aura had become more refined.

As he exclaimed, the flesh on Lil’ Red’s back began to wriggle before it formed into a pair of crimson draconic wings. The pair of wings had fused perfectly with Lil’ Red.

In the Indigocloud Lake, Lil’ Red had evolved once, giving off the feeling of being a dragon. Although the aura Lil’ Red emitted was powerful back then, it wasn’t perfect. Back then, Lin Yun speculated that Lil’ Red had undergone a mutation and hadn’t awakened its bloodline fully.

But now, Lil’ Red bloodline has fully awakened. Although it didn’t evolve into a dragon, its wings were a huge change. While he examined Lil’ Red, a crimson light flashed and Lil’ Red appeared in front of him.

“What speed!” Lin Yun exclaimed inwardly. Lil’ Red had reached a speed so fast that he couldn’t catch up with it. If he met an enemy with such speed, he would be in the disadvantageous position.

Looking at the shock on Lin Yun’s face, Lil’ Red chuckled and revealed its bucktooth smile.

Putting the Indigoflame Thunderwhip away, Lin Yun mounted Lil’ Red and smiled, “Let’s get going.”

It was time for Lin Yun to head to the Thunder Prefecture. This prefecture was known as the pinnacle of the Ancient Southern Domain where countless geniuses gathered. While riding horseback, Lin Yun’s eyes lit up brightly and his blood began to boil.

In the Ancient Southern Domain, the nine overlord forces were considered the kings. The Ancient Southern Domain also had nine prefectures, with the Thunder Prefecture being the strongest. Among the nine overlord forces, the Indigomoon Elysium was the strongest and they displayed the power of the Sword Sect. Only the Heavenly Demon Pavilion and Northern Snow Manor could fight them, but they were still ultimately weaker.

The Thunder Prefecture was where the Sword Sect was back in the day. So it naturally had a stronger foundation than the other eight prefectures. With the Indigomoon Elysium being stationed in the Thunder Prefecture, the Thunder Prefecture had become even more famous.

For cultivators, they constantly sought to grow. So it was natural that elites would start to gather in the Thunder Prefecture. In addition to the Thunder Prefectural City, the Thunder Prefecture also had seven other main cities. The seven cities weren’t inferior to any of the other prefectures.

But if the seven cities were like stars in the sky, the Thunder Prefectural City was like a boundless moon shining brightly. The Skymound City was one of the seven cities and it was where the Sword Sect had originated from.

Therefore, the Skymound City occupied a huge territory of the Thunder Prefecture and the city was filled with towering pavilions. Between the boundless palaces, the city had a towering inn filled with people. However, there were two people among the crowd looking around as if they were looking for someone.

These two were Guo Xu and Yang Fan. They arrived in Skymound City three days ago at the agreed upon time. However, Lin Yun was still nowhere to be seen. Because of this, they couldn’t help feeling a little anxious.

“Brother Yang, did Lin Yun leave because he had something else?” Guo Xu asked with his brows locked.

“Since he promised us, he will definitely show up. Even if something came up, he should have arranged someone to inform us about it,” said Yang Fan calmly.

“Is that so? What if he ran into trouble in the swamp?” questioned Guo Xu.

“I don’t think that’s possible,” said Yang Fan. With Lin Yun’s strength, it shouldn’t be a problem for him to make it out of the swamp as long as he didn’t provoke any overlord demonic beasts. But thinking about it again, the odds of Lin Yun provoking an overlord demonic beast were rather high.

Hmmm? Yang Fan’s eyes suddenly lit up and he smiled, “He’s here.”

“Where is he?” asked Guo Xu.

Right at this moment, Lin Yun slowly walked over while riding on an eye-catching Dragon Blooded Horse. Lil’ Red had already retracted its wings, but even so, it was pretty eye-catching. Many people even looked at Lin Yun with a malicious gaze.

“Sorry for making you guys wait,” said Lin Yun as he got down the horse and cupped his hands together.

“It’s alright. Let’s go,” said Yang Fan and Guo Xu. They examined the Dragon Blooded Horse with shock. Back in the Withernorth Sea, Lil’ Red had left a deep impression on them. But when they looked at Lil’ Red again, they noticed a mighty and profound aura.

The two led the way before stopping at a majestic courtyard. The walls of the courtyard were as high as ten meters. Even in the Skymound City, a manor of such scale was rare. Before they even went in, someone recognized Yang Fan and rushed forward to lead the way.

“Let’s go in,” said Yang Fan.

The trio passed through many corridors as they headed towards a hall as high as three thousand meters.

“Lin Yun, have you participated in a similar gathering in the past?” probed Guo Xu.

“Not really, but I have a rough idea about the rules,” said Lin Yun as he nodded his head.

Yang Fan smiled, “This gathering is a bit different. It might be an exchange, but no one here is simple. Normally, no one would bother participating, but with the Draconic Banquet so close, everyone wants to see each other’s strength. This helps us get a rough estimate of this year’s Draconic Banquet.

Lin Yun understood those words because that was also one of the things that attracted him. The host of this gathering was a genius in the inner ranking.

“But…” Yang Fan looked at Lin Yun and hesitated. “Lin Yun, we’re outsiders. The locals of the Skymound City will probably stand together, so it's best for you to be prepared.”

Be prepared? Lin Yun smiled, but he didn’t reply to those words. He wouldn’t cause any trouble as long as no one provoked him. He would retreat others with respect if he was given respect. But Lin Yun was never someone with a good temper.

Guo Xu and Yang Fan exchanged a look before revealing bitter smiles. It looks like their warning was useless. Lin Yun had stood out back in the Withernorth Sea, so how could he be someone without a temper? They knew that Lin Yun didn’t care about someone’s origin if he was provoked.

However, they were also curious as to how strong Lin Yun had gotten in the past few months. This gathering should be enough to force out Lin Yun’s true strength.

When they entered the hall, the tables were already arranged with dozens of youths sitting down. With a quick glance, it was easy to tell that they were all in the pinnacle Yang stage. There were even two geniuses in the lesser Yin-Yang stage that were emitting a powerful aura.

“Yang Fan, you’re late,” smiled a youth.

“Indeed, I’m late,” said Yang Fan as he cupped his hands. Simultaneously, he transmitted his voice to Lin Yun, “This is the host of today’s gathering, Xiang Tianhe. He was ranked forty-seven on the previous Dragoncloud Ranking. He was already in the Yin-Yang stage half a year ago. Of course, he’s much stronger now.”

Lin Yun couldn’t help examining this person after listening to Yang Fan’s explanation. Xiang Tianhe was skinny and tall, with an aura like a blazing sun. Lin Yun could sense some pressure just by standing close to him.

Xiang Tianhe looked to be twenty-three years old. He was in the lesser Yin-Yang stage half a year ago, but now he was in the pinnacle Yin-Yang stage. It wasn’t easy making any improvement after reaching the Yin-Yang stage, so Lin Yun could guess that this person was strong since he could reach the pinnacle Yin-Yang stage so quickly.

Lin Yun speculated that Feng Wuhen probably couldn’t take more than ten moves from Xiang Tianhe.

“Yang Fan, you’re still stuck in the pinnacle Yang stage? Somuch time has passed, so I’m afraid it won’t be easy for you to stay on the Dragoncloud Ranking with your current cultivation,” said an arrogant youth with a playful smile next to Xiang Tianhe.

“Haha, how can my talent be compared to you, Brother Jin Yan. I can only try my best,” replied Yang Fan calmly with a smile.

The youth known as Jin Yan revealed an unnoticeable smile in his eyes before he continued, “Who’s this person next to you? I don’t think I recognize him. Brother Xiang might have a good temper, but you’re in no position to bring anyone you please. Everyone here is an elite of Skymound City and they’re experts on the Dragoncloud Ranking. There’s no room for a nobody.”

Guo Xu spoke coldly, “Who are you calling a nobody? Even Ji Wuye was defeated by Lin Yun. Do you really think you have the qualifications to mock him?”

His words instantly caused the hall to go silent as many people turned to look at Lin Yun. Even Jin Yan turned to look at Lin Yun with surprise.

Xiang Tianhe smiled, “Ji Wuye is infamous in the outer ranking. Since you defeated him, you naturally have the qualifications to be here. Someone, show him to his seat.”

Under countless peculiar gazes, Lin Yun sat down and raised his cup without any change in his expression. It looks like this gathering was going to be more interesting than he could have imagined.
