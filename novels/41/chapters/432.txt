Chapter 433 - Unexpected Strong Opponent

Lin Yun was surprised that Wu Mohan of the Primal Origin Sect was his last opponent. This person did not have any stunning fights and his victories had been difficult to obtain. Even Lin Yun wasn’t optimistic for him. In fact, he didn’t even pay much attention to this person.

To his knowledge, the strongest group from the Primal Origin Sect were Heartcliff and Zuo Yun. However, neither of them were in the eighth group. He initially thought that there weren’t any Primal Origin Sect’s disciples in the eighth group, so he never expected Wu Mohan to be from there.

When Lin Yun suddenly thought of something, a smile rose on his lips. If Wu Mohan had only won several times, then it was doubtful. But coincidentally, none of Wu Mohan’s wins were easy. Once or twice was a coincidence, but consecutive wins were a little fishy. The first round was an elimination battle and there wouldn’t be any coincidences as the battle progressed.

“They ran into each other?” A cold smile rose on Wen Yanbo’s face. The scene he was expecting had finally come. The other elders, along with Heartcliff, wore sinister smiles because they were looking forward to this battle.

On the other hand, Zuo Yun appeared concerned. He could only hope that Lin Yun wouldn’t underestimate Wu Mohan’s strength.

“And here I thought that I wouldn’t run into you. What a coincidence for us to meet in the last match,” said Wu Mohan as he looked at Lin Yun.

“You’ll regret running into me,” smiled Lin Yun. He knew that this person was probably the Primal Origin Sect’s hidden chess piece for the Dragon Gate Competition.

“You seem rather confident about your strength. Then again, everyone from the Primal Origin Sect has heard about you,” replied Wu Mohan. His tone sounded calm, but there was something unusual about the calmness behind his tone. Lin Yun had been on his hitlist ever since Lin Yun killed three of the Primal Origin Sect’s core disciples in the Demonlotus Realm. So there was vague killing intent hidden in Wu Mohan’s calm tone.

“Start your attack. This is the last fight, so there’s no need for you to beat around the bush. The winner will stay and the loser will leave,” replied Lin Yun coldly.

“As you wish!” Wu Mohan took a step forward. When he stepped out, he suddenly unleashed a torrential aura that signified his cultivation had surpassed the pinnacle tenth stage.

“Quasi-Violet Palace Realm!” Lin Yun’s face turned grave when he felt the aura. Clearly, Wu Mohan had been putting on an act all along.

“Holy shit, what’s wrong with this fellow?”

“No one was optimistic about him before, but he actually has cultivation in the quasi-Violet Palace Realm?”

“His schemes run deep.” Everyone was confident that Lin Yun would win this battle. After all, Lin Yun had crushed his opponents along the way. So no one had expected that Wu Mohan would appear out of nowhere. If Lin Yun didn’t run into him, he could probably continue his consecutive victories.

The dracophant energy spread out on Wu Mohan’s body. When he stomped on the ground, the sheer force shook the entire stage. Wu Mohan was seen clenching his fist as an ancient cauldron slowly enveloped his fist. The cauldron was engraved with the ancient dracophant, which emitted a violent aura. He was unleashing the Primal Origin Sect’s strongest martial technique derived from the Dracophant Battle Physique, the Dracophant Battle Fist.

Focusing all his energy, Wu Mohan threw a punch at Lin Yun. The sheer force behind this punch could easily kill an elite in the tenth stage.

“You think killing me is that easy?” Lin Yun’s strength was definitely not as it appeared on the surface. He might be in the pinnacle ninth stage, but he could already kill cultivators in the tenth stage and was comparable to a quasi-Violet Palace Realm. So there was no need for him to be nervous.

Raising his brow, Lin Yun suddenly emitted a crystallized luster that bloomed like a bright sun. In his dantian, the Iris Flower also bloomed as it slowly revolved. When his sword aura reached the pinnacle, the Golden Crow Seal appeared behind him and he soared into the sky. He was swinging both his fists at the incoming cauldron.

With an earth-shaking clash that echoed in the surroundings, his fist that was enveloped with his sword aura smashed into the cauldron. He threw out over a hundred punches to destroy the cauldron.

“Take a move from me too!” Lin Yun started to form seals and manifested the Undying Vajra Seal and Sky Breaking Seal. With an aura that wasn't any weaker than Wu Mohan’s, he attacked with the seals.

Looking at the two seals coming at him, Wu Mohan pointed his finger out with an indifferent expression. His dracophant energy focused into a crimson beam that pierced through the seals.

“Vajra Breaking Seal!” But the moment the Vajra Breaking Seal was destroyed, Lin Yun took seven steps with the Seven Profound Steps and appeared beside Wu Mohan. The combination of three and four seals might be powerful, but it was too taxing on his origin energy. So he couldn’t use them casually.

In an actual fight, it was more suitable for him to mix and match the four seals. Relying on the Seven Profound Steps, Lin Yun circled around Wu Mohan as he kept throwing out different seal combinations. He used the Vajra Vanquishing Seal, Vajra Breaking Seal, and Heavenly Vanquishing Seal combinations ro envelop Wu Mohan. After fending off ten-odd moves, Wu Mohan finally lost his patience and yelled, “Dracophant War Spear!”

His origin energy gushed out from his body and formed into a crimson spear that looked like a ferocious dragon. Holding the spear with both hands, he swung it in a circular motion. “Break!”

The seals began to shatter in front of his spear. After Wu Mohan dealt with all the seals, he stabbed his spear at Lin Yun. As for Lin Yun, he could only watch as the spear swiftly approached.

“You won’t be able to escape,” sneered Wu Mohan as he watched Lin Yun trying to dodge with the Seven Profound Steps. It was impossible for Lin Yun to dodge this attack even if his movement technique was powerful. Lin Yun could be proud that he managed to last so long under his attacks.

“How powerful!” Lin Yun had never been forced to this step in the competition and he couldn’t tell how much power Wu Mohan poured into this attack.

“The Primal Origin Sect isn’t like the Heavenly Profound Sect. So what if you’ve learned the Dracophant Battle Physique? You’re still forced into a dead-end!” Wen Yanbo stroked his beard while watching. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Damn it!” The faces of the Heavenly Profound Sect’s elders and disciples turned dark, but they could only hold their rage inside.

“This old fellow!” Trueorigin’s eyes flashed with displeasure when he looked at Wen Yanbo’s smug face.

The spear that he couldn’t dodge was swiftly approaching, so Lin Yun made a decision. He suddenly came to a stop, which confused many people.

“You’re courting death if you dare to take the Dracophant War Spear from a quasi-Violet Palace Realm head-on!” snorted Wen Yanbo.

Without any warning, Lin Yun threw his punch out at the spear. His vitality surged like a violent wave as he threw out a dracophant from his punch. Under his punch, the terrifying attack from Wu Mohan was forcibly stopped. At the same time, saintly music echoed out from the stage. This was the sign of the Dracophant Battle Physique reaching the pinnacle of the fifth stage. Under his punch, the spear began to crack before it shattered into pieces.

“Damn it! How is this possible?!” Wen Yanbo was dumbfounded. The number of those in the sect who could reach the fifth stage were few in number. How exactly did Lin Yun manage to do it?

Although the spear cracked, the energy contained in the spear was still horrifying as the energy gushed at Lin Yun like a volcanic eruption. However, before Wen Yanbo could rejoice, the energy bounced off from Lin Yun’s body.

Standing on the stage, Lin Yun was currently donned in a purple armor. The armor was covered in dracophant runes and emitted a violent aura. It was thanks to this armor that Lin Yun came out unshattered from the clash.

“The Dracophant War Armor!” The Primal Origin Sect naturally recognized the armor.

“Now, this is interesting. If my eyes aren’t fooling me, this should be your sect’s secret art, right? So why is it in the hands of an outsider? The Primal Origin Sect is truly formidable. It looks like only the Dracophant War Armor could block the Dracophant War Spear!” mocked Trueorigin. His mockery instantly raised a laughter from the Heavenly Profound Sect’s party.

“Just what the hell is going on?” Wen Yanbo’s facial expression was brilliant. He never imagined that the Dracophant War Armor used by Lin Yun was even stronger than the ones summoned by many elders.

“Bright out all your strength. It’s impossible for you to kill me with just this much. Don’t embarrass the Primal Origin Sect,” said Lin Yun coldly.

“I have indeed underestimated you. But it’s time for this little game to come to an end!” Wu Mohan laughed with cold killing intent gushing out of his eyes. At the same time, a terrifying aura began to emit from his palm.

Martial Soul? Lin Yun frowned his eyebrows.
