Chapter 1767 ‚Äì Dual Dragon Saint Physique

Within the Lotus Treasure Bottle within the Three-Lives Realm, a person was seated on the sea of blood with his legs crossed. He was enveloped in a blue radiance, and seven dragon pulses were behind him.

The sky was filled with thunderstorms, and the Divine Azure Blood was endlessly pouring into his dragon pulses. Each of his dragon pulses have reached the height of four thousand feet, tempered by the Divine Azure Blood. They were like immovable mountains emitting horrifying pressure.

Without him knowing it, Lin Yun had stayed within the bottle for half a year now. Within six months, he has refined less than one-tenth of the Divine Azure Blood. Although there were no breakthroughs in his cultivation, the length of his dragon pulses reached an unbelievable height.

After all, the dragon pulses could be tempered only after reaching the ninth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, accumulating their strength before reaching the Samsara Edict Realm. But under the help of the Divine Azure blood, Lin Yun‚Äôs dragon pulses grew to four thousand feet.

It wasn‚Äôt because he didn‚Äôt want to make a breakthrough in his cultivation, but he couldn‚Äôt undergo his tribulation here. The Three-Lives Realm was an isolated space that differed from the other secret realms. This secret realm was utterly isolated from the Kunlun Realm, and even the flow of time was different here.

There wasn‚Äôt any spiritual energy here, not even the concept of heaven and earth. Thus, no tribulation could descend here, meaning Lin Yun couldn‚Äôt make a breakthrough in his cultivation even if he wanted to. But even if he couldn‚Äôt make a breakthrough in his cultivation, he could still allow his dragon pulses to grow.

He also made a breakthrough in the Blue Dragon Skybreaking Art here, reaching the third stage. But despite the breakthrough in his body-refining technique, the number of golden-purple dragon runes didn‚Äôt increase, but a new variety of dragon runes appeared.

He now had jade-blue dragon runes symbolizing the Blue Dragon and golden-purple dragon runes symbolizing the Azure Dragon, so a hundred thousand dragon runes should be the limit. As time flowed, three years passed when he finally reopened his eyes.

There was still two-thirds of Divine Azure Blood that remained, and his dragon pulses grew to nine thousand feet. His physique had reached a limit, and he could no longer refine the Divine Azure Blood. According to Lin Yun‚Äôs speculation, he could only continue to refine them after reaching the Samsara Edict Realm.

With a flash, he left the space within the Lotus Treasure Bottle. When he waved his hand, the bottle returned to his hand, and he put the cork back on.

Looking satisfied, Lin Yun raised his head and noticed that the black void at the edge was gradually dissipating. While the void was dissipating, it was being reduced to particles that were progressively disappearing. G·∫πtt the lùíÇtest ùíèùíêvùíÜls at ùíè.o/(v)/e/l/biùíè(.)coùíé

‚ÄúThose should be space-time particles‚Ä¶‚Äù Lin Yun muttered to himself. The space-time was how the Three-Lives Realm was formed and how the Three-Lives Tree projected the past, present, and future.

Speaking of which, he hadn‚Äôt asked what Yue Weiwei saw from him. He was actually pretty curious because if he had a past, was it Lin Yun on Earth or Lin Yun in the Profound Amber Realm?

He quickly recollected his thoughts, slowly removed his upper clothes, and circulated the Blue Dragon Skybreaking Art. Two different dragon runes appeared on his body, one was blue, and the other was golden-purple, and the number of both dragon runes together reached a hundred thousand.

The golden-purple dragon runes emitted a domineering and ferocious aura, while the jade-blue dragon runes looked like jades, flawless and emitting a noble aura.

Over the past three years and six months, he refined one-third of Divine Azure Blood. In addition to the assistance of the Blue Dragon Bone, his Blue Dragon Skybreaking Art reached the pinnacle ninth stage. Strictly speaking, he now possessed the Dual Dragon Saint Physique, consisting of the Azure Dragon Saint Physique, which granted him the ability to manipulate thunderstorms, and the Blue Dragon Saint Physique, which granted him control over life and death.

The Blue Dragon symbolized lifeforce, but because he cultivated the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra, he possessed the characteristics of death in the form of erosion of life. It wasn‚Äôt an exaggeration to say that the Blue Dragon controlled life and death. Although it wasn‚Äôt that exaggeration, it had taken shape now.

‚ÄúPerhaps I‚Äôll also be able to grasp the nirvana dao one day?‚Äù Lin Yun muttered to himself. The Iris Saint Sword grasped the nirvana dao, which was why he could slay deities while being at the Saint Realm. Life and death were a form of nirvana, and he wondered if this was an opportunity for him. Then again, he was just thinking about it.

The nirvana dao was a supreme dao, and it wasn‚Äôt as simple as life and death. Life and death were nirvana, time and space were nirvana, and the changes of four seasons were also part of nirvana. But it was still too soon for him to think about it now.

Recollecting his thoughts, the golden-purple and jade-blue dragon runes condensed before they separated. Not long later, two dragons flew out from his body. One was a Blue Dragon, and the other was an Azure Dragon. The former had lightning flickering in its pupils, while the latter looked like blue jades eluded a noble aura. Rather than calling the Blue Dragon a divine dragon, it looked like an immortal amongst dragons because of its jade-like temperament, and the divine radiance within its pupils grew even more terrifying.

When the two dragons flew over, they intimately approached Lin Yun; to which Lin Yun smiled and caressed their heads. He then leaped to the sky and landed on the back of the Azure Dragon before soaring around this space. The Blue Dragon followed behind, and the two dragons danced within this space, filling every inch with a majestic dragon aura. The dragon's aura was so massive that it could blow up this place anytime.

When Lin Yun had enough fun, he recalled the two dragons back into his body, and his pupils were excited. He now possessed the Dual Dragon Saint Physique and was one step closer to the Azure Dragon Divine Physique. Then again, it was a long process that required opportunities, so he couldn‚Äôt be too anxious about it.

Since the Three-Lives Realm could still last, Lin Yun decided to practice the Azure Dragon Sword Art. This sword technique had ten swords, and the first seven swords represented each part of the Azure Dragon, manifested with sword rays before allowing him to wield his sword like a dragon.

The last three swords were ultimate attacks, and one was more ferocious than the previous. The Azure Dragon Sword Art required a high level of comprehension, but it wasn‚Äôt as tough as the Divine Firefly Art. With his talent in sword dao, he could easily grasp it.

In addition to his Azure Dragon Saint Blood and refining so much Divine Azure Blood, he also grasped the profundity of the Azure Dragon. So practicing this sword technique was much easier than the Carefree 9 Swords. It might be simple to cultivate, but the power wasn‚Äôt weak at all. In addition to the Azure Dragon‚Äôs profundity, it was even stronger than the Carefree 9 Swords in some aspects.

The first sword form was named Azure Dragon Claw. As his figure changed, the sword he swung was like a claw with the clouds rumbling as the claw became enveloped in a thunderstorm. Each sword was accompanied by a piercing thunderstorm, resounding between heaven and earth, that boosted his azure dragon‚Äôs aura.

The second sword form was named Azure Dragon Tail, and the sword ray unleashed by the Flower Burial Sword would turn into a dragon tail that was a few dozen feet in length. In the path of the majestic thunderstorm, even space became distorted.

The third sword form was named Azure Dragon Scales. When he rose to the sky, the dragon scales became engraved with saint runes, like sharp daggers raining down like a densely packed storm.

The fourth sword form was named Azure Dragon Body. This sword technique focused on defense. When Lin Yun swung his sword down, a massive dragon coiled around him, protecting him like an impenetrable castle.

The fifth sword form was named Azure Dragon Head. He would turn into a streak of light that stabbed forth, and he could even pierce through a mountain,

The sixth sword form was named Azure Dragon Eyes. Swinging the Flower Burial Sword, his sword ray shone like the Azure Dragon‚Äôs eyes, making it too dazzling for anyone to look at.

The seventh sword form was named Azure Dragon Horns, and this was the sharpest attack. The sword was like the dragon‚Äôs horns, and the sword ray could even pierce through the defenses of saint armor and demonic beasts.

The eighth sword form was named Nine Heavenly Storm. This was the ultimate attack of the Azure Dragon Sword Art by unleashing a powerful tornado with a swing of the sword, crushing everything that stood in the way and fully unleashing the destructive power of the wind.

The ninth sword form was named Thunder Spike. It could summon lightning from the nine heavens with the sword, accumulating all the lightning bolts within a hundred thousand miles in radius before forming into nine lightning bolts on the sword. This sword was terrifying, more terrifying than the Nine Heavenly Storm.

The last sword form was named the Universal Thunderstorm, unleashing the pinnacle power of a thunderstorm by perfectly blending wind and thunder together. It was born from the Azure Dragon and surpassed the Azure Dragon, and this sword was infinitely close to dao.

Lin Yun brought the first seven sword forms to the manifestation stage in just three days. It didn‚Äôt take long with the seventh and eighth sword forms. But for the last sword form, he couldn‚Äôt fully master it within the Three-Lives Realm.

Lin Yun roughly knew the profundity contained within it, but this place was isolated from the Kunlun Realm. Without the concept of heaven and earth, he couldn‚Äôt grasp the Azure Dragon Dao here.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs look at it again after I get out.‚Äù Lin Yun stowed the Flower Burial Sword. When he looked around, this region was reduced by a lot. Looking at this speed, the Three-Lives Realm would disappear in another six months.

He didn‚Äôt waste any time and sat with his legs crossed to stabilize his cultivation. When he reopened his eyes, six months had already passed.

When the Three-Lives realm disappeared, Lin Yun found himself in the courtyard he was previously in. When he swept his gaze over, he saw Mu Xueling, who was toying with the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella, and she was looking at him with a strange look of surprise.

She asked, ‚ÄúHow long have you been in there?‚Äù

‚ÄúHow much has time passed in the outside world?‚Äù

They asked their questions at the same time. Lin Yun briefly paused before he smiled, ‚ÄúSaint Elder, you first.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt has been seven days in the outside world.‚Äù Mu Xueling replied.

This meant the four years he spent in the Three-Lives Realm were only seven days in the outside world. The Three-Lives Realm was really mysterious.

When Mu Xueling knew that four years had passed, she didn‚Äôt seem rather joyful, but said, ‚ÄúIf I knew it would be so long, I shouldn‚Äôt have let you use the Three-Lives Fruit.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù Lin Yun asked in surprise.

The shortest time for the Three-Lives Fruit was one year, and the longest was ten years. To stay in the Three-Lives Realm for four years, his luck wasn‚Äôt too bad.

Mu Xueling explained, ‚ÄúHave you considered how terrifying your tribulation will become with your nine thousand foot-long dragon pulses? Nine thousand feet! Your dragon pulses will probably reach ten thousand feet by the time you reach the eighth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm!‚Äù

Lin Yun was taken aback when he heard that because he hadn‚Äôt really thought about it.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine if you only stayed there for a year.‚Äù Mu Xueling said. ‚ÄúBut even your Blue Dragon Bone might not be able to save you now.‚Äù

After a brief pondering, Lin Yun wore a wry smile, ‚ÄúThis is a problem. I‚Äôll figure it out when the time comes. At the very least, staying four years is better than one.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre pretty optimistic. I‚Äôll need some time with the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella. I have to go back to the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion to seek help from the pavilion master. Are you going back with me?‚Äù Mu Xueling asked.

‚ÄúI have to go meet Mei Zihua first. So I‚Äôll entrust the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella to Saint Elder.‚Äù Lin Yun said.
