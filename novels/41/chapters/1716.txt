Chapter 1717 – Celestial

I can’t see anything. As blood splashed, Huang Xuanyi fell into horror when he discovered that his vision had become dark.

“NO!” Huang Xuanyi wailed out, but Lin Yun couldn’t be bothered with him and simply tossed him away.

“Brother Huang!” The Wind Edge Lord was shocked as his wine glass fell. Executing his top speed, he caught Huang Xuanyi. But when he examined Huang Xuanyi, his face instantly became dark because Huang Xuanyi was blinded once again.

All the guests were shocked by this scene, and their jaws nearly fell to the ground. Everything happened too quickly. Not only did the table turn around instantly, but Lin Yun even blinded Huang Xuanyi’s eyes.

As a terrifying killing intent swept out from the Wind Edge Lord, he coldly looked at Lin Yun and reprimanded, “Lin Xiao, how dare you! Do you really think that I don’t dare to kill you? How dare you be so ruthless in a friendly spar!”

“What impressive breadth of mind. Wind Edge Lord, why didn’t you say anything earlier when he threatened me, then?” Lin Yun ridiculed.

“Wind Edge Lord, why bother getting furious over a brat like him? You won’t be able to answer the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion if you kill him. Let me do it.” Jiang Yu stood up just when the Wind Edge Lord’s facial expression was extremely dark.

“I’ll have to trouble Uncle Jiang, then. I’ll thank you greatly after that.” The Wind Edge Lord rejoiced and quickly left with Huang Xuanyi. He immediately arranged for a senior of his clan to treat Huang Xuanyi’s eyes. He had reservations about killing Lin Yun, but it would be great if Jiang Yu made a move.

Jiang Yu appeared before Lin Yun with a flash, and he coldly looked at the latter. When he released his aura as a Samsara Edict Realm expert, it immediately made everyone in the surroundings feel tremendous pressure.

“Lin Xiao, Huang Xuanyi is a genius of the holy land. How dare a barbarian like you blind him! Are you trying to start a war between the two sects?!” Jiang Yu said coldly while taking a step forth. “I have long discovered that you’re a disaster, holding ulterior motives towards my Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion. Today, I’ll clean up the scum and cripple your eyes before bringing you to the Ming Cult to be punished!”

“You dare?” Lin Yun glared at Jiang Yu, and he barked, “You’re simply a traitor. As an elder of the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion, how dare you openly attend the West Garden Banquet. Are you disregarding the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion? A person is really invincible when he forsakes his face. Do you really think that I’m here alone?”

Logically speaking, Gu Jun should be nearby, but Lin Yun could no longer trust him when Gu Jun still hadn’t shown up. He could only treat it as Gu Jun had fled. After all, there was no way Gu Jun could protect him, even if he were around.

But he couldn’t be bothered with that and could only use it to intimidate Jiang Yu. He was confident that Jiang Yu was guilty and wouldn’t dare to touch him.

Everything went as he had expected. Jiang Yu’s hand stopped in mid-air. Despite being furious, he didn’t dare to move after hearing what Lin Yun said. He doubtfully looked around, trying to see if anyone else was hiding in the surroundings.

“You want to make a move against me when you’re already in trouble? Get lost!” Lin Yun was flamboyant when he saw Jiang Yu panic. He quickly pushed his palm forth against Jiang Yu. But because Jiang Yu had strong cultivation, this palm couldn’t injure him. Even so, he was still caught by surprise and was sent flying back, smashing a table into pieces.

This scene dumbfounded everyone because they never expected that an expert at the pinnacle Nirvana Stage would be so pathetic in front of Lin Yun.

“Father, kill him!” Jiang Feng stood up when he saw Lin Yun being so arrogant.

Jiang Yu’s face changed, and he had a feeling that there was a pair of eyes directed at him. This instantly made him panic, and he began to look around to see if Saint Elder had come. He ignored what Jiang Feng said and became suspicious.

“The brightest moon shines on the most beautiful lady, and her graceful steps tingle my heart.” While everyone was shocked and received a huge impact, an ancient song suddenly resounded within the banquet. This voice sounded ethereal, and the song soon captivated everyone. Their hearts became peaceful, with a rising moon and a beauty in their hearts.

That was the Saint Tone. Everyone could instantly savor the artistic concept in the song. Turning their heads over, they saw the Orchid Creek Valley’s chief disciple, Kong Ying, playing the zither. His clothes were fluttering, looking ethereal and elegant.

The zither music manifested by Saint Tone sounded beautiful to others, but it harbored boundless killing intent towards Lin Yun.

Lin Yun spun in mid-air and dodged the soundwaves. When he stabilized himself in mid-air, the soundwaves assaulted him again, and half of his fluttering hair was sliced off. This instantly made his hair scatter into a mess as his hair fell to the ground.

“The willow weep upon my departure, with rain and snow falling upon my return.” Kong Ying strummed the zither, and another soundwave flew out. The soundwaves manifested into willow branches lashing at Lin Yun. The willow branches might seem soft, but they left cracks in the surrounding space when lashed.

Despite pushing his Divine Sunchasing Art to the limit, Lin Yun was still caught by the shockwaves, which left several wounds on his body. Although he already expected that it would be terrifying when Kong Ying used those hands of his to play the zither, he never expected it to be so troublesome.

When he took a few more lashes, Lin Yun returned to where he initially stood and gently placed his hands on the Thunderstorm Zither.

Saint Tone was constantly being unleashed from Kong Ying’s fingers through music, and his attacks were like herds of horses galloping over from different directions, emitting an ancient radiance.

As Lin Yun placed his hands on the Thunderstorm Zither, he looked at Kong Ying before shaking his head, “Your song is disappointing.”

But Kong Ying didn’t care about him, and he continued to sing, “Oh brilliant white colts, will you come to me?”

Empowered by his music, the galloping white horses emitted a terrifying aura like ancient heavenly horses that wanted to crush Lin Yun.

Right then, a phoenix cry echoed when Lin Yun’s fingers strummed on the zither, and the speed of his strumming reached an unbelievable pace. The music was filled with ferocity, and the first note was like an explosion that resounded beside everyone's ears, making everyone feel their scalps tingle and ears ringing.

As more musical notes flew out from Lin Yun’s fingers, each note was terrifying, and Lin Yun's radiance was even stronger than Kong Ying's. Under his music, the galloping white horses began to explode and let out miserable wails.

When everyone looked at Lin Yun again, their eyeballs nearly fell out of their eye sockets. This was because Lin Yun was also using Saint Tone, but how was that possible? They couldn’t believe that Lin Yun was also a Grand Musician, and everyone present nearly went insane. No matter how they pondered it, the thought of Lin Yun being a Grand Musician had never crossed their minds. A Grand Musician was noble, so how could it possibly be connected with a barbarian like Lin Yun?

“T-T-This…” Xu Dongfei and Lan Hongyan were dumbfounded, their faces becoming pale, especially Lan Hongyan, who nearly fainted on the spot. They also couldn’t believe that someone so unruly would be a Grand Musician. There had to be a mistake somewhere. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

This caught Kong Ying by surprise, and the strings on his zither snapped in the next second, placing him in a dangerous position.

Right then, the Wind Edge Lord waved his hand to retrieve an ancient zither before giving it to Kong Ying, “Brother Kong, use my zither!”

Simultaneously, two flute musics resounded. One from a normal flute and the other from a long flute. The Saint Tone became even more profound when the two flutes’ music combined.

When the Wind Edge Lord’s zither fell before Kong Ying, the latter gently strummed it. Hearing the sound produced by the zither, Kong Ying praised, “What an excellent zither!”

Raising his head to look at Lin Yun, Kong Ying began to play the zither. This time, Kong Ying, Xiahou Feng, and Xin Wuhen joined forces. Their music instantly became more majestic, creating a massive phenomenon around them that filled every inch of space with musical notes.

When their music swept towards Lin Yun in the form of three massive waves, their pupils were filled with destruction, as if they had become the manifestation of the waves. Their music immediately caused the Prairie Phoenix Fire Lin Yun was playing to crumble, and the crimson phoenix also let out a wailful cry before being crushed into pieces by that wave.

“Excellent!” Lin Yun smiled, looking at the three waves sweeping over, and his music changed once more. This time, he was playing the Ni Chang Dress Song. As snowflakes fell, the rainbow light rays were like clothes forming into a robe donning Lin Yun.

Wearing a smile, Lin Yun’s ten fingers danced on the zither, and he was exuding unrivaled elegance at this moment. He was like a celestial rising to heaven, crushing the three waves under his music. As Lin Yun caressed his zither, he said, “My turn now.”

Pushing the Divine Phoenix Tough to the limit, Lin Yun’s fingers became blurred, and everyone could see countless fingers strumming the zither. When Kong Ying, Xiahou Feng, and Xin Wuhen saw this scene, they were dumbfounded, and their eyeballs nearly fell out.

As lightning flickered on the zither strings, Lin Yun played another ancient score by himself, the Silver Starry Sky and Nine Heavenly Phoenix Dance.
