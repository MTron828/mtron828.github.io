Chapter 181 - Indisputable

The sword flash released from the Divine Flicking Sword pierced through Wang Ning’s chest. The wound ran so deep that it looked impossible to close up anytime soon.

Lin Yun and Li Wuyou followed the blood tracks that were left behind. The two of them shuttled through the forest with great agility, leaving dust in their wake. In just fifteen minutes, they caught up to Wang Ning.

“You still want to run?” Lin Yun sneered, unleashing two violet ripples from his fingertips.

Ohmmmmn!

The violet sword flashes rippled as they pierced through the air. The tree branches that were in the way were all snapped and their leaves drifted down. Wang Ning attempted to block the attack, but he was sent flying from the explosions.

Whoooosh!

Lin Yun jumped and landed on the ground with Li Wuyou. A sword shrouded in blood mist fell onto the ground, stabbing Wang Ning’s bloodied hand. The sight was captivating. He had a wound so deep that it ran into the bones.

He had injured his hand earlier when he tried to block the Divine Flicking Finger. Lying on the ground, Wang Ning maintained his composure and smiled savagely, “Sword slave, it looks like you’re really unable to bring out your Martial Soul. You’re nothing but a piece of trash!”

Lin Yun’s face was calm in the face of Wang Ning’s insults, he only stared at him coldly. He had an irreconcilable blood feud because Wang Ning had engraved pain into his heart. Back in the Azure Sky Sect’s Sword Cleansing Chamber, he had cowardly hid in the icy pool. At that time, there was nothing he could do except listening to how Wang Ning took Senior Hong’s life. He would return an eye for an eye and today was the day he would exact his revenge.

“I don’t need my Martial Soul to kill you,” said Lin Yun.

Wang Ning began to feel fear when he looked at Lin Yun’s gaze. He was frightened by the dense killing intent in Lin Yun’s eyes. However, he didn’t want to beg for mercy and replied coldly, “You bastard, kill me if you dare! You’re just a puny sword slave who can’t bring out his Martial Soul! Even if you join the Sword Firmament Pavilion, you’re still a piece of trash! My brother will seek vengeance for me!”

“As you wish.” A violet sword flash gathered in Lin Yun’s fingertips once more, aimed at the center of Wang Ning’s forehead. But before the sword flash could reach Wang Ning, it was suddenly intercepted by a Blackflame Crow. The Blackflame Crow turned into a blood mist, but it managed to stop Lin Yun’s attack. Wang Ning’s eyes lit up when he saw this and immediately rolled onto his feet to resume his escape.

Caaaw! Caaaaaaaw!

Blackflame Crows flocked over from the surroundings before Lin Yun and Li Wuyou could chase after Wang Ning. The Blackflame Crows were just third orifice demonic beasts, but they traveled in flocks!

With thousands of them coming together, not even a Profound Martial Realm cultivator could escape them. If a Profound Martial Realm were trapped, the consequences would be dire.

Boooom! Boooooom!

Lin Yun threw out three punches and every strike killed over a dozen Blackflame Crows. Everywhere his fists traveled, a mist of blood was left created. In the blink of an eye, he had taken the lives of nearly a hundred Blackflame Crows.

On the other hand, Li Wuyou was brandishing his sword, taking a Blackflame Crow’s life with every stab. But the black flames from the Blackflame Crows were greatly restricting them.

“Big Brother Lin, someone’s controlling these Blackflame Crows!” Li Wuyou yelled.

“I know! Try and figure out how these birds are being controlled!” yelled Lin Yun.

Blackflame Crows only ate rotten meat. So it made no sense for them to attack unless they were being manipulated. There was a towering white bear at the edge of the flock with someone sitting on top and blowing a bone flute. As the man blew on the flute, the Blackflame Crows would flock over endlessly from the surrounding forest.

“Mo Qingyun!” Li Wuyou was slightly stunned when he saw the culprit. Mo Qingyun was also a seeded candidate. He had obtained his status through his Profound Martial Realm cultivation. He had only met Mo Qingyun once back when the latter was standing on the stage, so he wasn’t familiar with this person.

Putting down the bone flute in his hand, Mo Qingyou smiled, “Second Young Master Wang, how do you plan on thanking me for this?”

Taking a deep glance at the latter, Wang Ning replied, “You’re a smart person. You should know that the Profound Martial Realm doesn’t mean much in the Sword Firmament Pavilion. It’s hard to make any improvements without anyone backing you up. Luckily, my brother never treats an intelligent person poorly.”

Mo Qingyun didn’t give any reply except for a deep smile. He looked at Lin Yun and Li Wuyou, who were surrounded by the Blackflame Crows and asked, “How do you want to deal with these two?”

“Torture them! But don’t kill them. I want to do it personally.” Wang Ning said with a vicious light glowing in his eyes.

“Understood,” replied Mo Qingyun.

Wang Ning took out two pellets and consumed them before he closed his eyes to recover. Mo Qingyun was shocked when he saw the pellets. One was the Great Profound Pellet, while the other one was the Heart Nourishing Pellet. They were precious pellets used by Profound Martial Realm cultivators. Wang Ning was truly worthy of being the Wang Family’s direct descendant to casually use such precious resources.

Retracting his gaze, the white bear beneath Mo Qingyun roared as he played the bone flute once more. Within the flock of Blackflame Crows, Lin Yun and Li Wuyou were both trying their best to defend themselves from the attacks.

“Big Brother Lin, someone is manipulating them using a bone flute!” Li Wuyou took a brief pause between the Blackflame Crow’s attack to look around and saw the person blowing the flute again.

“Buy me some time!” Lin Yun opened the sword box on his back and grabbed onto the Flower Burial Sword. He felt connected with the sword, allowing him to manipulate his sword intent as he wished.

“Are you going to attack? Don’t worry. I won’t let a single one of these stinking birds get near you!” Li Wuyou’s eyes flashed with a vicious light.

Amidst the flock of crows, Li Wuyou’s sword flashed, instantly creating an empty region in the center. Raising his sword before him, Lin Yun closed his eyes and started brewing the incomplete sword intent within him. The Iris Flower in his Dantian also began to burn wildly, releasing violet spiritual energy that coursed through his veins. Every circulation would cause the flames to burn even brighter.

After eight circulations, the sword intent rippling around Lin Yun’s physical body was already at its limits. The surface of his skin began to crack and beads of blood flowed out. However, Lin Yun endured it because he knew that he hadn’t reached his limit. At the very least, he still hadn’t used the Thunderblitz Battle Physique!

When the Iris Flower circulated for the ninth time, Lin Yun suddenly opened his eyes. A wisp of flame blazed within his eyes as he activated the Thunderblitz Battle Physique. The incomplete sword intent that he had accumulated also reached an unprecedented height.

Shrrrrnnnk!

Lin Yun pulled out his sword. The Flower Burial Sword flowed smoothly like water as it streaked across him. The rippling sword intent contained in it caused the sword to start buzzing. As the sword buzzed, Lin Yun unleashed his sword intent.

In a split second, the surrounding Blackflame Crows were all shredded into pieces. Above the forest up in the horizon, a Sword Condor was patrolling in the sky. The ears of the elder that was standing on it jolted lightly before he commented, “What a powerful incomplete sword intent…”

Mo Qingyun, who was blowing the bone flute, spewed a mouthful of blood. The bone flute in his hand also cracked. He only took a glance at it before his complexion turned pale. This bone flute was his Martial Soul and he would be harmed directly if he was injured any further.

As for Wang Ning, who was circulating his cultivation technique to recover from the injuries, he received a heavier blow and vomited out three mouthfuls of blood. When he was done, his face had turned completely white. His head was ringing and he had a splitting headache.

“Get on!” Mo Qingyun gnashed his teeth and reached out for Wang Ning. He pulled the latter up on the white bear and began to make his escape.

“Lil’ Red!” Lin Yun roared with killing intent flickering through his pupils. The Dragon Blooded Horse shuttled out from the forest at his beckoning. Lin Yun jumped onto the horse and pulled Li Wuyou up on it. The Dragon Blooded Horse then transformed into a crimson bolt and started galloping like the wind.

The ground would rumble when its flaming hooves landed on the ground. Mo Qingyun’s face changed. When he turned around, he could only see a crimson bolt chasing after him. But before he could even react, the crimson bolt slammed into the white bear. Wang Ning and Mo Qingyu were both thrown off the bear.

The bear flipped and rolled on the ground. It roared, revealing its sharp teeth. Its eyes had turned red and it was shrouded in killing intent.

The Dragon Blooded Horse responded mockingly with a goofy grin that revealed its iconic bucktooth. TIt stepped forward and gave three heavy stomps on the white bear. The first stomp caused the white bear to cry out in pain, the second one drew a mournful howl from it, and the third stomp had directly killed it. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Lin Yun and Li Wuyou got off the horse and walked towards Wang Ning and Mo Qingyun. Looking at Mo Qingyun, who was a seeded candidate, Lin Yun smiled, “There doesn’t seem to be a shortage of people who want to become the Wang Clan’s lackeys.”

Mo Qingyun felt insulted as rage burned wildly in his chest. He spoke out solemnly, “You only got lucky because I was careless. Killing a fifth orifice like you is as easy as slaughtering chickens!”

“Behave yourself!” Li Wuyou moved forward and stepped on Mo Qingyun.

Mo Qingyun, whose Martial Soul had been injured, couldn’t move at all. He could only inwardly bear the humiliation.

Lin Yun turned to look at Wang Ning. The latter was injured by the ringing from his sword earlier and his injuries had became more serious. However, Wang Ning gnashed his teeth and kept silent.

“You can blame me that even heaven wants you dead.” Lin Yun stabbed his sword out at Wang Ning’s head. But when he stepped forward, a mighty gale descended from the sky. The boundless sword aura in the wind made Lin Yun and Li Wuyou take a few steps back.

They waited for the gale to dissipate before they opened their eyes. A Sword Condor had descended from the sky with an elder standing on it.

“Save me!” Wang Ning cried out pitifully as he ran over to the elder.

Lin Yun’s rage blazed. He raised the Flower Burial Sword in his hand and swung it at Wang Ning.

“Impudent!” The elder barked and waved his hand at the Flower Burial Sword.

“Lin Yun wants to kill me! Senior Brother Mo here is my witness!” Wang Ning stared daggers at Lin Yun with a smug look on his face.

“Lin Yun is deranged! He launched a sneak attack on us and even damaged my Martial Soul!” Mo Qingyun said coldly with slyness flashing in his eyes.

The elder looked down at the two parties before he spoke out, “Lin Yun, what are you doing, trying to kill your fellow disciples instead of hunting demonic beasts?”

Right at this moment, Leng Mo’s group rushed over. He was briefly stunned when he saw the elder before he spoke out, “Lin Yun killed four seeded candidates and all of their pendants have been taken by him. I’m guessing that he intended to do this from the beginning.”

The slander made Li Wuyou roar out furiously, “Do you guys have any shame?! Who’s trying to kill who?! If Big Brother Lin and I didn’t have any strength, we would be dead by now!”

“Lin Yun even dares to kill me with you around. His words can’t be trusted! A shameless person like him who only knows how to stab people in the back is shameful to the sect! I suggest that you kill him here!” Wang Ning sneered.
