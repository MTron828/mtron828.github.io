Chapter 2474 - Youth And Phoenix

Back to the Skysolute City, the White Emperor said, “It’s a pity that the Flame Emperor is too smart. If the Blade Emperor made a move, we have to cripple him, at least, even if we can’t kill him.”

“You’re doing it on purpose,” Lin Yun smiled.

“Half-half, I guess. This lapdog is arrogant, and he should be taught a lesson to be disrespectful to you. How can your current status be compared to him? We should’ve moved against him earlier,” the White Emperor smiled.

Lin Yun still hadn’t come to his senses from what the White Emperor said.

The Black Emperor nodded, “Whitey is right. You’re our lord, and your status is equal to the Empress. As for him...he’s a lapdog of the Empress...” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

As he spoke, he continued, “As a lapdog of the Empress, he had no qualification to speak to you in that manner, and we have to set up the rules.”

The White Emperor smiled and looked at the Black Emperor, satisfied that the Black Emperor also called the Blade Emperor a lapdog. The White and Black Emperors were myths in the Kunlun Realm, and this concept was imprinted in everyone’s mind. Who could’ve thought the mythical emperors would take Lin Yun as their lord?

“Dao Suspend, we will be taking our leave to discuss the Deification Ceremony,” the Radiant Sword Emperor said as he came over. This sword was the Heavenly Dipper Sword that Lin Yun ‘borrowed’ from the Hidden Sword Manor, but it was a pity that he didn’t use it on his tribulation. But when everything ended, the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint still gave it to the Radiant Sword Emperor, and he cherished this sword or the person who gave it to him.

“You all can stay in Skysolute City for now. If you all need help, the Skysolute City will do our best to help,” the Dao Suspend Sword Saint said, cupping his fists together.

“Thank you,” the Radiant Sword Emperor cupped his fists together and left. With that, the gathering in Skysolute City had ended, and what happened in the gathering would shock the entire Kunlun Realm.

Lin Yun first challenged all the sword saints, defeating ten sword saints, and he climbed the summit of the Heavenly Divine Mountain. When he came down, he could fight an Emperor and even defeat an expert among the Emperors like the Ice Emperor. His strength had caused a great shock to everyone.

Many people were saying that even the Southern Emperor might not be able to surpass him at his age and cultivation. More people compared him with the Iris Sword Saint, a legend who slew a deity in the Saint Realm. It had always been a legend, which no one believed. But after witnessing Lin Yun’s strength, they finally believed it.

“Perhaps he can accomplish it. Otherwise, where would Flower Burial get his confidence to fight the Empress?”

“Let’s not mention if it’s true or fake, but the White and Black Emperors have acknowledged Lin Yun as their lord. Do you think the eyesight of mythical emperors are inferior to us?”

“Indeed. The White Emperor even wanted to teach the Blade Emperor a lesson for Lin Yun.”

Lin Yun’s achievements weren’t as shocking as the Black and White Emperors’ attitudes against him. The influence of mythical emperors was more significant than Lin Yun had imagined.

When the news spreads, Lin Yun’s status rises in everyone’s hearts, causing his fortune to rise significantly. On the contrary, the Empress’ fortune was affected because of it.

The Thousand Plume Grreat Saint left with the Dao Yang Holy Son and Bai Shuying on the same night. Meanwhile, Lin Yun, the Radiant Sword Emperor, and the two Emperors were discussing the Deification Ceremony.

“13th of Month Four...there’s less than half a month left...” Lin Yun frowned. He had a great harvest in this gathering and needed time to digest them.

“No hurry. The problem is how we should deal with that. Should we call the other Emperors to go with us?” The White Emperor muttered.

“Is there a need for that? Isn’t this between me and the Empress?” Lin Yun asked curiously.

“What are you thinking about? There are many forces behind the Empress, and everyone’s interest would be affected if she failed. Let’s not mention the others, but the dragon kings were willing to see him become a Deity,” the Black Emperor smiled. “If she became a deity, the Divine Dragon Empire’s position would rise, and the dragon kings could even take a step further.”

The Radiant Sword Emperor nodded, “Most importantly, Yu Qingfeng is gone, and no one is certain that they won’t have other thoughts.”

Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts as that was an issue. Even if Yu Qingfeng didn’t make a move, his presence was a deterrence to many people, and Lin Yun had underestimated that influence in the past. Not that the deterrence was no longer around; those people might take the risk and do something that the Empress could not control, such as that Blade Emperor!

The Blade Emperor asked, “Radiant Sword Emperor, how are you compared to Yu Qingfeng?”

The Radiant Sword Emperor didn’t hesitate, and he said, “If it’s the Sword Emperor from three thousand years ago, I can defeat him. But if it’s the Sword Emperor now, I only have thirty percent odds of winning.”

Then again, there was only Yu Qingfeng in the Kunlun Realm, and the Yu Qingfeng outside was a different story.

“But I have an advantage compared to him. I have the Jian Clan’s inheritance and the Truth Dao I comprehended.”

When the Black Emperor heard that, he smiled, “Since that’s the case, there’s no need to invite any other Emperors. If Lin Yun fails, we can leave with him relying on our strength.”

The Black Emperor was cautious and confident in Lin Yun, but complete preparation was necessary.

“Will it be a problem for you now that you’re no longer a myth?” The White Emperor asked in a concerned tone.

The Black Emperor smiled, “It might be a problem now, but it won’t be a problem when the Heavenly Path is reforged. I have a high chance of reaching the Deity Realm ahead of you now that I’m no longer tied down.”

As he spoke, he looked at Lin Yun, “You can go into seclusion first. We’ll handle the other matters.”

“Okay.” Lin Yun left without any hesitation. He needed to go into seclusion to digest his harvest in this gathering.

After Lin Yun left, the Black Emperor’s eyes flashed with a hint of murderous intent. He said, “We have to be well prepared. I know the temper of those in the Divine Dragon Empire and the Blade Emperor...they won’t give Lin Yun a fair chance at fighting. Let’s not mention the dragon kings, but the Blade Emperor will surely try to stop it. Even the Empress might not be able to stop him.”

“I will deal with him,” the White Emperor said.

“Truth be told, you might not be his opponent. The Radiant Sword Emperor is why the Flame Emperor stopped him,” the Black Emperor said.

The White Emperor sneered in disdain, but he didn’t refute that.

“You can spar with Radiant these days,” the Black Emperor said.

The White Emperor wasn’t willing, but he gave in after looking at the Black Emperor’s gaze. After all, the Blade Emperor even gave up his status as a myth because Lin Yun paid a bigger price than him.

The White Emperor said, “Radiant, you can smash my status as a mythical emperor like your disciple.”

“How will I? We’re just playing around,” the Radiant Sword Emperor smiled.

“That’s great.” The White Emperor said, but he couldn’t help feeling a chill down his spine looking at the Radiant Sword Emperor’s smile. For some reason, he felt this smile was similar to Lin Yun's. Would it really be fine?

The Radiant Sword Emperor looked at the Black Emperor, “What about the Flame Emperor? You have missed him out.”

“He won’t make a move. His personality is humble, but he just goes with the flow, always leaving some leeway for himself,” the Black Emperor smiled.

The Ninth Emperors might be geniuses, but they have a different personality. The Southern Emperor was infatuated in love, Yu Qingfeng was a youth, the White Emperor was a brute without brains, the Empress was a ruler, and the Black Emperor was simply two-faced.

After leaving, Lin Yun swiftly met Lil’ Purple, who descended and stood in his way.

“You’re not going to return to the Divine Phoenix Mountain?” Lin Yun asked. The Deification Ceremony would be a battle in which not even the Divine Phoenix Holy Master could participate. Even the Thousand Plume Great Saint had returned, and Lin Yun planned to let Lil’ Purple stay in the Divine Phoenix Mountain for some time.

“I’m not going back to the Divine Phoenix Mountain. I’ll go wherever you go,” the Lil’ Purple said, raising her head. She continued, “Don’t look down on me. Now that the Phoenix Tree is fully grown, I have one-tenth of my peak strength.”

“Let’s go,” Lin Yun smiled. The Lil’ Purple could stay in the Iris Secret Realm in the critical moment, and no one could harm her. He was only worried that she might jump out when he fought the Empress.

The Lil’ Purple’s eyes lit up, and she asked, “Where are we going?”

“The Heavenly Divine Mountain’s summit,” Lin Yun said. He brought Lil’ Purple to the waist of the Divine Phoenix Mountain, which was the starting point of this path.

“Are we going to climb together?” Lil’ Purple smiled.

“Yeah. Stand behind me, and I’ll bring you over,” Lin Yun nodded.

“No need!” Lil’ Purple snorted and gave off an ancient yet sacred aura before Lin Yun could respond. As a phoenix cry echoed, this aura belonged to a phoenix, the aura of a pure-blooded divine beast.

Even if this aura wasn’t directed at Lin Yun, it shocked him. He saw an indigo ice phoenix hovering close to a hundred feet in the air, spreading his wings apart and looking flawless.

“How beautiful!” Lin Yun couldn’t help praising as that was a phoenix, and he now knew that Lil’ Purple wasn’t boasting.

The Lil’ Purple pridefully said, “Don’t think I didn’t improve in the Divine Phoenix Mountain. My harvest was bigger than yours. Give me your hand; I’ll bring you up the mountain.”

Lin Yun merely smiled and recalled what Lil’ Purple told him many years ago. She said she would bring him and fly when she regained her body.

Lin Yun smiled and grabbed Lil’ Purple’s claw before they flew up the mountain. Lil’ Purple might be flying, but the speed wasn’t fast.

When Lin Yun looked down on the mountain, it felt magical, with his vision opening up. The path looked like a coiling dragon stretching to the sky. Grabbing the claw felt weird for Lin Yun, and he smiled bitterly, “Empress, are you going to carry me to the summit like this?”

“Hmph, sit properly, you scumbag!” Lil’ Purple put Lin Yun on his back as they flew.
