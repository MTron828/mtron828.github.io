Chapter 1267 - Dignity

While Lin Yun was standing in mid-air, the surroundings were piled with corpses and blood forming into a river. All the disciples of the big sects were dead. Since they were dead, their treasures, saint artifacts, and interspatial pouches were all swept up by Lil’ Red.

All the Empyreans down the mountain were dumbfounded by this scene and were shocked by the strength that Lin Yun had revealed. After they recovered from their shock, they excitedly yelled out with their blood boiling.

Previously, ten-odd big sect disciples were enough to intimidate, kill, and humiliate them. But now, what Lin Yun did was equivalent to taking revenge for them.

Looking at the sky, Lin Yun looked around before he barked, “Since big sect geniuses can compete for treasures that don’t have an owner, why can’t we? If anyone dares to stand in my way, then I won’t hesitate to kill them!”

His words left everyone dumbfounded because that was the same as waging war with the big sects and this was simply insane in their eyes. After all, the big sects all had an ancient heritage, and some of them could even compete with the powerful sects.

The Flame Dragon Sect had a flame jiao-dragon that they kept in their sect, and it was a great saint jiao-dragon. As for the Azure Thunder Sect, they had an azure moon that manifested with lightning and flames that hadn’t extinguished for thousands of years.

When Lin Yun was done, he turned into a streak of light and charged towards the Dragon Blood Fruit’s birthplace.

An hour later, Lil’ Purple’s voice resounded from the sword box as she flew out, “Stop.”

The saint liquid had stopped raining, but the atmosphere was still moist. They could even see big sect disciples around, excitedly collecting the saint liquid.

“You’ve come out?” Lin Yun smiled.

“Yeah. I’m out to get some fresh air. I’m gratified by your domineering performance earlier.” Lil’ Purple nodded her head because she felt that Lin Yun didn’t let her down.

In response, Lin Yun merely smiled. He had gained an inheritance from the Azure Dragon Lord, who bestowed him the Azure Dragon Saint Art, not to mention that he had many other opportunities as well. Regardless of the Origin Saint Rune, divine dragon aura, or blood essence, they had nothing to do with Lil’ Purple, and it was those three opportunities that allowed him to soar into the sky. They brought his Azure Dragon Saint Art to an unprecedented height, and the azure dragon aura wasn’t any weaker than his divine firmament sword intent.

More accurately, his azure dragon aura and divine firmament sword intent complemented each other, as was reflected in the azure dragon and miniature human in his sword ocean.

“The saint liquid is extraordinary, don’t waste it,” said Lil’ Purple as she looked at the saint liquid with a grave expression.

Lin Yun was briefly stunned by her words. But since she said so, this meant that the saint liquid wasn’t ordinary, since he knew how high Lil’ Purple’s eyesight was.

“But I won’t be able to compete for the Dragon Blood Fruit if I spend time collecting the saint liquid…” Lin Yun didn’t hold back earlier in killing to end the battle as quickly as possible. He knew that the Dragon Blood Fruit was going to appear soon, and this place was big. This meant that he needed time to search the place.

It was night time and the air was moist. He could only roughly sense the direction, but he knew that he would have to spend some time before the phenomenon appears.

“Then I’ll collect some for you. Not much, just a jar will do. Even if the others collected the saint liquid, they won’t be able to tell how extraordinary the saint liquid is like me,” said Lil’ Purple with pride written on her face as she raised her head.

“Are you serious?” Lin Yun asked.

“Have you ever seen me bullshit?” Lil’ Purple became unhappy when she heard what Lin Yun said.

Hearing that, Lin Yun could only smile awkwardly because Lil’ Purple really did bullshit a lot, like how she was born before the world and how she wouldn’t die even if the world dies.

“Don’t worry. When this empress gathers enough saint liquid, I can help your physique reach a new height before you leave the Profound Wither Island, reaching the level of a thousand runes.” Lil’ Red said before she left together with Lil’ Red and even pointed towards a direction for Lin Yun, “The Dragon Blood Fruit is over there.”

Lin Yun knew that reaching the level of a thousand runes wouldn’t be easy. He was only two hundred away before reaching the level of a thousand runes, and the Scarlet Blood Fruit only added a few dozen dragon runes.

It wasn’t because the Scarlet Blood Fruit was bad. It was a lot stronger than the true dragon saint liquid he had refined in the past, but it was because he had reached a high level in the Azure Dragon Saint Art.

Since Lil’ Purple was usually pretty reliable, he was looking forward to it, and this made his eyes blaze with flames. Following the direction Lil’ Purple pointed out to him, Lin Yun sped his way through and encountered many big sect disciples along the way.

Since they were too far away and those people still had no idea what he had done, they didn’t hesitate to attack Lin Yun when he encountered them. At the same time, Lin Yun also didn’t hesitate to start a massacre with no one capable of stopping him.

But when they looked at Lin Yun heading towards the Dragon Blood Fruit’s birthplace, it was as though they were looking at a dead person. A brief moment later, a towering mountain appeared before Lin Yun. This was a barren mountain that was emitting a faint light and traces of scarlet aura.

“It’s you?” Just when Lin Yun was about to go forth, a figure appeared before him. When Lin Yun saw them, he was surprised because this was someone he knew. It was Gongsun Yan whom, he met and fought back in the Sword Assembly.

Gongsun Yan said that they would fight again in the future and he would let Lin Yun know about his true strength at that time. But the current Gongsun Yan was covered in injuries, looking as if he was running for his life. When Gongsun Yan saw that there was someone ahead of him, he was startled and wanted to flee for his life. But when he caught a clear glimpse of Lin Yun, he exclaimed, “Lin Yun? What the hell are you doing here?”

“Same as you,” replied Lin Yun.

Gongsun Yan was briefly stunned before he sneered, “I’m not the same as you. I’m here for the quasi-saint elixir. Don’t tell me you think you’re qualified to compete for it?”

“The Dragon Blood Fruit is with you?” Lin Yun’s eyes shone brightly as he circulated the Azure Dragon Saint Art with fighting spirit blazing in his heart.

But Gongsun Yan didn’t notice Lin Yun’s changes and only wore a mocking smile. “I thought that I can compete for it with the chief disciples of those big sects. But it turns out that I’m too naive…”

He was disappointed and seemed to have suffered a huge blow. Furthermore, he was heavily injured and even seemed to be humiliated.

His words gave Lin Yun a headache, and he interrupted, “The Dragon Blood Fruit has been born?”

“Not yet,” replied Gongsun Yan.

“Then take care of yourself.” Lin Yun didn’t have any friendship with Gongsun Yan. So he merely nodded his head before he continued forth.

Since Gongsun Yan was greatly affected by his failure, he had no intentions of fighting Lin Yun and only wanted to find a place to recover from his injuries. But just when he was about to leave, he suddenly recovered and yelled, “Don’t tell me you’re going to fight for the quasi-saint elixir?!”

“Why not? If you can, why can’t I?” Lin Yun didn’t want to bother with Gongsun Yan at this moment. Gongsun Yan was just a failure, and even looked down on him. If it wasn’t because Lin Yun wasn’t fond of committing unnecessarily massacre, he would’ve long slaughtered Gongsun Yan.

“Haha.” Gongsun Yan’s eyes flashed with mockery. “Don’t tell me you think you can compete with those top-tiered geniuses just because you became the champion of the Sword Assembly? You better think it through. We all had to restrict our cultivation back then and gave you the chance to win. Otherwise, I could easily defeat you with a single hand.”

“Are you done?” Lin Yun asked in annoyance.

“I…” Gongsun Yan swallowed his words, seeing that Lin Yun was starting to get annoyed. He knew that he couldn’t fight Lin Yun right now.

“If you’re done, then you can get lost,” said Lin Yun coldly.

“You!” Gongsun Yan became enraged and threw out a mouthful of blood with his face turning even paler. Then, he wore a bitter smile. “I’m really unlucky to let you see me in this state. But let me tell you that even if I’m this injured, I’m not someone you can humiliate!”

But when Lin Yun heard that, he burst out in laughter. Gongsun Yan was just a failure in Lin Yun’s eyes, and he thinks of himself as a dragon or tiger? Lin Yun only found Gongsun Yan adorable at this moment.

“What are you laughing at!” Gongsun Yan raged.

“Alright, you can follow me, then. If I’m in a good mood, I might spare you some leaves of the Dragon Blood Fruit,” smiled Lin Yun.

Hearing that made Gongsun Yan feel humiliated, and he coldly said, “You’re humiliating me? I might not be from the direct lineage of the Sword Emperor, but I have my own pride. Even if I died in the hands of the big sects and won’t be able to get the quasi-saint elixir, I won’t take anything from you!”

Looking at Gongsun Yan talking with such dignity, Lin Yun was briefly stunned before he said, “Looks like I’ve underestimated you. You do have some dignity after all. Do as you wish, then.”

When he was done, he no longer bothered with Gongsun Yan and left. When Gongsun Yan looked at Lin Yun’s silhouette, he coughed becaused Lin Yun was really going after the quasi-saint elixir. But just when Gongsun Yan turned around, he began to have doubts on his face.

“I’ll follow him and see how he dies!” Making up his mind, a decisive light flashed through Gongsun Yan’s eyes as he secretly followed Lin Yun.
