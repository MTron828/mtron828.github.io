Chapter 1160 - Chill Down The Spine

When dawn arrived, Ye Ziling opened her eyes and looked at Lin Yun.

Seeing that Ye Ziling had woken up from her comprehension, he smiled, “Looks like you’ve benefited greatly.”

“You didn’t sleep?” Both of them spoke at the same time. Ye Ziling could tell from Lin Yun’s bloodshot eyes that he didn’t sleep or cultivate after drinking the Millennium Wine. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“You drank the Millennium Flame and then cultivated like nobody’s business. How could I dare to sleep? What would we have done if Lei Ying suddenly returned?” smiled Lin Yun. He had always been a cautious person.

“You’re a lot more cautious than I would have thought. Were you this cautious when you were in the Heavenly Path? Never letting your guard down even for a moment. It’s tiring, right?” Ye Ziling asked.

Lin Yun merely smiled and changed the topic, “I have something I need to be honest with you about. The Blood Flame Dragon Rune Metal’s origin stone might not have been lost. I think I might have refined it subconsciously. Otherwise, I wouldn’t be able to achieve the Azure Dragon Saint Physique upon awakening.”

Lin Yun was careful with his words. After all, Ye Ziling had placed her life on the line to secure the origin stone for the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. She might even be blamed for losing it. Furthermore, she might even be responsible for the death of the two elders at the campsite.

It was naturally good if the origin stone was still around, but he had unknowingly refined it. So it would probably be troublesome when the elders arrive later.

Ye Ziling got up from her seat and looked at Lin Yun with a playful smile, “Lin Yun, you must have drank too much. What nonsense are you talking about? I didn’t hear you correctly. How can the origin stone be possibly refined?”

“I didn’t drink much…” Lin Yun paused halfway before he smiled after looking at Ye Ziling’s playful expression. He looked at her doubtfully and asked, “You already knew about it?”

“Why don’t you take a guess? The Azure Dragon Saint Physique is no small matter. Now you can focus on reaching the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm when you get back. Champion of the Ninth Heavenly Path, I’m looking forward to seeing how you’ll shine in Kunlun Realm,” smiled Ye Ziling.

“Hahaha!” Lin Yun laughed because he had never felt so happy before. It was great that he could have someone to talk to genuinely for the first time without any burdens or schemes.

Ye Ziling also examined Lin Yun before she smiled, “You’re pretty handsome, and I’ve never seen someone so handsome swinging the sword aside from my father.”

“Lady Ye, don’t tell me that you’ve fallen for me?” Lin Yun smiled.

“I might have fallen for you if I didn’t already fall for someone else. You’re outstanding, and you have a scent that I like,” replied Ye Ziling honestly.

“Flower Burial?” Lin Yun probed.

When Ye Ziling heard that, she nodded her head bashfully.

But when Lin Yun heard that, he immediately cried out inwardly before he replied, “You like him, but he might not like you. Loving someone one-sidedly isn’t easy.”

“You don’t understand,” replied Ye Ziling. “We both have a common secret that we share!”

Secret? What secret? Why the hell don’t I know about this secret? Lin Yun widened his eyes in disbelief and asked, “What secret?”

“Heh!” Ye Ziling smiled. “I’m not telling you anything.”

When Lin Yun heard that, the corner of his lips couldn’t help twitching because he had no idea what Ye Ziling was smiling about.

“Hahaha! Don’t be jealous of Flower Burial because you’re already very outstanding. You’re not inferior compared to Flower Burial. You’re just lacking a little in style.” Ye Ziling turned her head away and began to recall how Flower Burial barged into the Heavenly Astral Pavilion clad in the moonlight and claiming lives with his flute.

When Lin Yun heard that, he couldn’t help smiling bitterly inwardly. After all, he was Flower Burial, so why would he be jealous? Then again, he only spoke about those in his heart and didn’t tell Ye Ziling anything.

“They’re here.” Ye Ziling raised her head to see several people rushing over from the campsite. There were three elders among them who were all in the greater Elysium Core Realm.

“Yeah.” Lin Yun replied. With what Ye Ziling said earlier, there was no need for him to worry about the origin stone anymore.

In the end, Ye Ziling took some of the blame for the origin stone, but the three elders didn’t doubt her words that the origin stone fled. In the end, one elder was left behind to search for the origin stone and chase after Lei Ying while the two remaining elders were responsible for escorting them back to the sect.

Along the way, he had won the respect of the other core disciples, thinking that it was Lin Yun who saved Ye Ziling. Ye Ziling didn’t deny their words because she didn’t want to share about Flower Burial’s arrival. Anyhow, Lin Yun and Ye Ziling had gotten a lot closer after this incident.

Six days later, the party finally returned to the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. When Lin Yun returned to his residence, he took out the jade flute to play it in front of Ye Ziling. But Flower Burial didn’t show up, leaving Ye Ziling disappointed. On the other hand, there was a piece of zither music that sounded out from the direction of the Sword Saint Mountain that matched Lin Yun’s music perfectly.

The music naturally came from Luo Hua, but Ye Ziling didn’t like Luo Hua so she only spoke in a disappointed tone, “Looks like he’s really heavily injured… Maybe he’s busy right now and isn’t even in the sect.”

“Perhaps.” Lin Yun put away the flute before he continued, “He’ll probably come and look for me when he’s back.”

While the two of them were chatting, a third person appeared in Lin Yun’s residence. He was a blue-clothed youth who carried a sword box on his back. Although his temperament wasn’t comparable to Lin Yun's, it wasn’t any worse.

“Junior Sister, it’s been a long time,” smiled the youth.

Junior Sister? Lin Yun was briefly stunned before he realized the identity of this person. There were four heavenly core disciples. Aside from Lin Yun, Luo Hua, and Ye Ziling, the last one should be this youth.

“You’ve reached the Astral Stage?” Ye Ziling asked in a surprised tone.

“I was lucky with my training outside. It looks like I made it in time for the ranking battle,” said the youth with his eyes glowing brightly.

“You’re Lin Yun, right? I’ve heard many things about you. I have to thank you for saving Junior Sister Ye.” The youth smiled at Lin Yun before lowering his head, “My name is Jiang Lichen, the chief disciple of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect and also Ziling’s senior brother.”

He had a good name, but his enmity was a little too obvious. It appeared that he had a crush on Ye Ziling for a long time. Why is he looking for me? She has a crush on Flower Burial!

“What are you doing here?” Ye Ziling frowned.

Jiang Lichen didn’t seem too bothered by her frown and smiled, “I just finished visiting our master. He instructed me to tell you both to go see him. I also heard that Junior Brother Lin has been trapped in the Heavenly Soul Realm for some time. You can look for me if you need any guidance. After all, I’m the chief disciple around here, and it’ll be bad for my name if others say that I’m not helping my juniors.”

At this moment, Lin Yun knew why Ye Ziling had no interest in Jiang Lichen despite his decent appearance and talent. Clearly, he only knew how to scheme. Although he said that he was willing to guide Lin Yun, he was actually mocking Lin Yun for not being qualified as a heavenly core disciple.

“I don’t need you to worry about me. Senior Sister should be free for the next few days, so I’ll just look for her instead.” Lin Yun winked before he smiled, “What do you think about tomorrow at my residence?”

When Ye Ziling heard that, she glared at Lin Yun before she replied coldly, “Keep going and I might break your legs.”

Hearing Ye Ziling’s response, Lin Yun shrugged his shoulders at Jiang Lichen, but it also made him look close to Ye Ziling. But Lin Yun didn’t stop talking, which made Jiang Lichen’s face turn even darker, “Hahaha. If Senior Sister is willing, I don’t mind if you break my legs.”

Jiang Lichen clenched his fist as he watched Lin Yun and Ye Ziling walk away together. His face was dark because they looked too close.

On the way to the sect master, Ye Ziling replied, “Senior Brother Jiang’s personality is pretty good, but he gets jealous easily. It’s not good for you to provoke him.”

“What can I do? I’m not a generous person either,” smiled Lin Yun. Jiang Lichen was just trying to show off his superiority in front of Lin Yun. However, Lin Yun had hundreds of ways to make Jiang Lichen feel terrible.

When they arrived at their destination, the sect master was waiting. When the sect master saw Lin Yun, he wore an amicable smile while exuding an unfathomable aura. He smiled, “I heard that you saved Ziling from the hands of Lei Ying?”

But before Lin Yun could respond, Ye Ziling replied, “Not him. Flower Burial saved me, but I’m not sure about his true identity. Is he really a core disciple of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect like the rumors say?”

When the sect master heard that, he was briefly stunned. After all, wasn’t Lin Yun Flower Burial? He first glanced at Lin Yun before he asked, “Why are you asking about him? He’s just a hermit. Don’t tell me that you’ve fallen for him.”

“I have.” Ye Ziling nodded her head, acknowledging her crush for Flower Burial.

But when Lin Yun heard that, he nearly choked on his saliva because Ye Ziling was too direct. He didn’t even dare to raise his head because he could feel a chill down his spine from the sect master’s gaze.
