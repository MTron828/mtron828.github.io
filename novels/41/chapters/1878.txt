Chapter 1879 - Who Do You Think You Are?!

Everyone from the Nether Orchid Courtyard practiced sword techniques because the Nether Orchid Courtyard only had the inheritance of sword techniques. The other peaks had various martial techniques, including swords, blades, and palms. But the Nether Orchid Courtyard was born for swords.

The last time he met Bai Shuying was when it was only her clone, and Lin Yun couldn’t help feeling breath taken to see her in person. Bai Shuying was donning a white dress decorated with orchid flowers. She had pearly-white skin and flawless features.

The word ‘peerless’ wasn’t enough to describe her beauty. This woman was absolutely gorgeous, and Lin Yun didn’t hold back in looking at her. At the same time, he was inwardly alarmed because he couldn’t see through her cultivation. This meant that she was at least at the Nirvana Stage, and it was no wonder why she was the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden.

But Lin Yun wasn’t surprised by that because Bai Shuying was already at the Dragon Pulse Realm three years ago. As the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden and the disciple of the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint, it wasn’t surprising that she could reach this height in just three years. It would be strange if she couldn’t do it.

When everyone saw how Ye Qingtian fearlessly looked at Bai Shuying, this instantly made everyone within the Nether Orchid Courtyard furious, and they didn’t conceal the disgust within their pupils when they looked at Ye Qingtian.

“Who the hell do you think you are? Who allowed you to come in?!”VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“What a bummer!”

“When did he come back? I thought he was crippled by Zhang Yue a year ago? Where did he get the guts to come back from?”

“This lecher is still the same as before. How dare he blatantly look at the holy maiden!” The silence within the Nether Orchid Courtyard was soon disrupted as everyone threw their cups on the floor.

Lin Yun could also sense more killing intent falling onto him. He had no change on his face, despite panicking within his heart, and he said, “Empress, can you sense the Sovereign Divine Rune?”

“I can’t come out, so it’ll take longer. Try and hold on for a little longer.” Lil’ Purple said from the Iris Secret Realm.

“Ye Qingtian, what are you doing here? Get out! Don’t you know that we’re holding the Sword Discussion Gathering here?!” Everyone from the Nether Orchid Courtyard was furious, wanting to take down Ye Qingtian. But Bai Shuying didn’t say a word. They would be bullying Ye Qingtian with their numbers if they made a move.

But the other peaks naturally didn’t have that much reservation. A blue-robed, elegant youth said, “Ye Qingtian, what is a piece of trash like you doing here? Get out! Don’t you know that we’re holding the Sword Discussion Gathering?!”

Right then, the Indigo Thunder Peak’s disciples came in, and they couldn’t help feeling a little afraid upon looking at this formation. After all, the disciples of the Nether Orchid Courtyard, Holy Spirit Courtyard, and ten-odd peaks’ disciples were glaring at them. There were a few hundred people gathered here for the Sword Discussion Gathering, and they were all top-tiered geniuses in the inner sect without exception.

"Senior Brother, that person is Su Ye of the Blue Frost Peak. You fought him two years ago.” Chen Feng whispered to Lin Yun. He didn’t dare to say that Ye Qingtian was taught a lesson by Su Ye, and he could only say that they fought in the past. This Su Ye was another one of Ye Qingtian’s "old friends".

At this moment, Lin Yun felt that everyone he ran into within the Heavenly Dao Sect had taught Ye Qingtian a lesson. But this made him even more curious as to just what did Ye Qingtian do in the Heavenly Dao Sect to be hated by so many people?

Are you sure? How long will it take? Lin Yun inwardly asked. He didn’t like this place, especially Bai Shuying’s gaze. From that gaze alone, he could tell that there must be a story between Bai Shuying and Ye Qingtian.

“Shut up and buy time.” Lil’ Purple said in an annoyed tone. Within the Iris Secret Realm, the Extreme Wind and Myriad Lightning Divine Runes were hovering beside her while slowly pouring their energy into her body. Lil’ Purple had to absorb the two Sovereign Divine Runes if she wanted to confirm if the Solar Lunar Divine Rune was in the Nether Orchid Courtyard. She could sense it as long as the Sovereign Divine Rune was here.

With no choice, Lin Yun could only embolden himself and step forth. Mimicking Ye Qingtian’s arrogance, he smiled, “Junior Brother Su, why are you asking the obvious? I’m naturally here to support Senior Sister Bai. How can it be called the Sword Discussion Gathering without me?”

As he spoke, he looked around and discovered that there were no empty seats around.

“Junior Brother Su?” Su Ye was stumped by Lin Yun’s form of address. He and everyone else were also dumbfounded, wondering if they had heard it wrongly. There might not be a clear line to differentiate between senior and junior brothers. Still, those from the Indigo Thunder Peak were of pitiful status, and they could only bow and address others as ‘Senior Brother’ no matter who they saw.

Thus, everyone was naturally shocked to hear how arrogant Ye Qingtian was to address Su Ye as a junior brother.

“Excuse me.” Seeing that there were no empty spots, Lin Yun walked forth and patted the shoulder of the person before him.

His action naturally infuriated that person, roaring, “This is my spot. Don’t touch me and get lost!”

“It belongs to me now.” Lin Yun wore a charming smile with his eyes squinted. He then immediately grabbed that person by the shoulder and threw him out before that person could respond. He had used the power of the Azure Dragon and Blue Dragon in his move, and that person flew out like a cannonball.

This scene instantly left everyone dumbfounded, and they were even more shocked than Lin Yun’s form of address toward Su Ye earlier. As for the disciples from the Indigo Thunder Peak, they were long dumbfounded by this scene.

Lin Yun sat down, picked up the spiritual fruit before him, and shoved it into his mouth. He smiled, “It tastes pretty good. Junior Brothers, come over and have a taste.”

As he ate, he ignored the gazes of everyone else seated at the table. A warm current flowed into his body when he swallowed the spiritual fruit, and his cultivation improved a little. It looks like the Nether Orchid Courtyard had taken out their treasures to host their guests.

Lin Yun naturally wouldn’t let this opportunity go and swallowed a few more spiritual fruits. He had to admit that the spiritual fruit tasted pretty good, and his action was no different from being arrogant in the eyes of everyone.

There was a nameplate on this table with ‘Soaring Bird Peak’ engraved on it, and this meant everyone at this table should be disciples of Soaring Bird Peak. The party's leader was a youth named Zhang Jinglong, with his cultivation at the pinnacle first channel of the Profound Death Stage. He would be conferred as a saint disciple half a month from now.

He was even younger than Lin Yun and naturally in his prime. So he naturally never experienced this situation before, and he lost his temper. Zhang Jinglong slammed his palm on the table and charged towards Lin Yun, “Ye Qingtian, you’re courting death!”

When he got close in mid-air, Zhang Jinglong reached out to Lin Yun’s neck. He was confident in his strength and wanted to hold Lin Yun by his neck and humiliate the latter. His speed was fast, and he only took a single second to arrive before Lin Yun.

Lin Yun, who was focused on eating the spiritual fruits, pushed his palm over without raising his head. He didn’t even place Ye Qing, who was at the third channel of the Profound Death Stage in his eyes, not to mention someone at the first channel of the Profound Death Stage like Zhang Jinglong.

Zhang Jinglong had swiftly charged over, but was sent flying out even quicker. When he was sent flying back, he coughed and threw out a mouthful of blood.

This scene naturally left everyone present shocked, and they couldn’t believe that Zhang Jinglong was defeated with one move.

“You bastard!” This naturally made Zhang Jinglong furious.

But just when Zhang Jinglong wanted to charge over again, Lin Yun laughed, “Wine, please!”

Lin Yun slammed his palm on the ground, and the wine in the jar before him splashed out. He raised his head to gulp down the wine. The wine was strong, and this made his face rosy.

The Soaring Bird Peak’s disciples, who were still seated at the table, were sent flying away by the force of Lin Yun’s palm before they could even respond. When they flew out and fell onto the ground, they all threw out a mouthful of blood with their faces distorted from the pain. With that, the disciples of the Soaring Bird Peak were eradicated just like that.

“Good wine!” Lin Yun laughed.

Zhang Jinglong, who wanted to dash forth once more, was horrified by this scene and no longer dared to make a move. This also caused a series of exclamations within the Nether Orchid Courtyard, and everyone turned to look at Ye Qingtian with shock in their eyes.

Even Bai Shuying was surprised. Sending those disciples flying away and causing the wine to splash out from the jar wasn’t surprising, but it was another story because Lin Yun accomplished both with one palm. Most importantly, not a single droplet of wine was wasted, and the spiritual fruits on the table weren’t affected by the shockwave of Lin Yun’s palm. Others might not be able to see how extraordinary that was, but Bai Shuying could.

“Why are there suddenly so many empty seats when I’m only having a drink? No one else wants to sit here? Let the disciples of the Indigo Thunder Peak sit here, then…” Lin Yun looked around and smiled with his eyes squinting.

The disciples of the Soaring Bird Peak gritted their teeth, but they didn’t dare to say a word and could only turn to look at Bai Shuying. The disciples of the Indigo Thunder Peak were also trembling in fear as they uneasily looked at Bai Shuying.

“Chen Feng, come over and sit here. Since Senior Sister Bai didn’t say a word, she naturally has no issues with it. Don’t underestimate the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden’s breadth of mind.” Lin Yun waved his hand.

Chen Feng didn’t dare to go against Lin Yun’s words and could only walk over with his head lowered. When the other Indigo Thunder Peak disciples saw that Bai Shuying didn’t say anything about it, they quickly walked over and sat down with joy on their faces.

“Holy Maiden…” The Nether Orchid Courtyard’s disciples finally couldn’t hold it back anymore, and turned to look at Bai Shuying.

Bai Shuying’s expression was cold, but she didn’t flare up on the spot and replied, “Let’s wait and see what he’s trying to do.”

Ye Qingtian was so arrogant in just one year, naturally confusing everyone.

“Ye Qingtian, how dare you disregard me!” A roar echoed.

Lin Yun, who was raising his cup, turned to look at where the roar came from. It came from the Blue Frost Peak’s Su Ye, who lost his temper when he saw Lin Yun ignoring him. Lin Yun sneered, lowering the cup to the ground, “Why can’t I disregard you? Many people hate me, so who do you think you are?”
