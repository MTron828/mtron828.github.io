Chapter 800 - Yue Weiwei VS Qing Ruoyou

Everyone fell silent when they saw Lin Tao get cut in half. First it was Qin Yang, now it was Lin Tao who got killed. Coincidentally, they were both from the Profound Yang Palace.

This made everyone suspect that Lin Yun had a grudge with the Profound Yang Palace. Perhaps this was the case since Xin Jue died from the Great Qin Empire’s crown prince’s scheme. After all, the crown prince had the Profound Yang Palace behind him.

Lin Yun really didn’t have a favourable opinion of the Profound Yang Palace. In fact, among the nine overlord forces, he loathed them the most. He would be disgusted if he even looked at them, which is why he never even spared Qin Yang a look during the beast tide. He didn’t even acknowledge Qin Yang’s attempt to mock him.

If it was someone else, the outcome might have been different. But since Lin Tao courted death, Lin Yun naturally wouldn't mind fulfilling his wish. After all, Lin Tao made several claims to cripple Lin Yun, which crossed his bottom line.

Everyone looked at Lin Yun with disbelief. After all, Lin Tao was one of the seven elites, and Lin Yun killed him. Even those who weren’t optimistic of Lin Yun no longer dared to belittle him.

“Damn it!” The faces of many elders from the Profound Yang Palace turned dark as they looked at Lin Yun with killing intent. All of them felt the urge to storm the stage and kill Lin Yun. Not only did Lin Yun kill Qin Yang, but he even killed Lin Tao. This meant that the Profound Yang Palace’s journey had come to an end.

They were already ranked at the bottom of the nine overlord forces, so their fortune would drop greatly after this banquet. It was uncertain if they could keep their spot among the overlord forces. Although they were enraged, they maintained their rationale.

After all, not even the Indigomoon Elysium dared to say a word when Lin Yun killed one of their disciples. At this moment, Yan Long’zi’s face was even more terrifying since he was dumbfounded by Lin Yun. “H-how is this possible?!”

Not only did Lin Yun kill Lin Tao, but he also proved Yan Long’zi wrong. Yan Long’zi nearly threw up blood as Lin Yun had become his bitter rival. None of the disciples around him dared to utter a word when they sensed the chilling aura from Yan Long’zi.

“What a piece of garbage! Did Lin Tao really want to challenge the three kings with that little strength?” Yan Long’zi cursed as he vented his anger on the already deceased Lin Tao.

“Whoa, his dragon is nearly thirty meters long!” A commotion broke out as Lin Yun’s dragon projection grew even bigger after absorbing Lin Tao’s profound amber aura. Suddenly, the dragon projection soared into the sky and roared as it brandished its claw. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

A terrifying dragon roar echoed out that caused the entire Nine Dragon Lake to tremble violently. Everyone could sense the terrifying pressure crashing over.

“How grand.”

“Even the likes of Yu Haotian can’t neglect him anymore.”

“How terrifying, the growth of Lin Yun’s dragon projection is even faster than the three kings. The fourth group is so exciting. Next we will get to see if Nangong Wanyu, Li Mubai, or Lin Yun is the strongest swordsman!”

“But based on the sword techniques revealed so far, Lin Yun is still far from Li Mubai and Nangong Wanyu. I wonder if he has any more trump cards.”

“It’s hard to say. After all, who would have imagined that Lin Yun would have such a terrifying physique and fist technique?”

“Lin Yun is at a disadvantage because he more or less revealed his trump cards because of Lin Tao.” The growth of Lin Yun’s dragon projection caused the crowd to share their opinions.

Even Lin Yun was surprised. He expected that he would devour a lot of profound amber aura by killing Lin Tao, but he never imagined that it would be this much. When the dragon projection returned to his body, he could sense his expended origin energy recovering at a swift speed. His aura had also grown even stronger and more refined.

“What a peculiar sensation. If I refine the dragon projection now, I’ll probably reach the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm.” Lin Yun could sense that his sword intent had gotten more refined under the nourishment of the dragon aura. The speed wasn’t fast, but he could sense the benefits from the dragon projection.

Right at this moment, Lin Yun sensed two gazes locking onto him. One was from Li Mubai and the other was from Nangong Wanyu. Their eyes were filled with fighting spirits and they didn’t bother restraining their sword intent, which made their gazes even sharper.

Their thoughts were obvious. Their dragon projections would become huge if they defeated Lin Yun.

Lin Yun turned to look at them and memorized their facial expressions. In that split second, he knew what they were thinking about. There weren’t many battles left, so he would run into them very soon. They clearly thought that Lin Yun revealed all of his trump cards.

Lin Yun waved his hand and directed the Flower Burial Sword into its sheath. Spreading his arms apart, he flew off of the stage. Although he already left the stage, everyone was still talking about him.

“Just how strong is Lin Yun?”

“In terms of sword technique, he might be weaker than Nangong Wanyu and Li Mubai. However, he has an advantage with his physique, so it’s really hard to say.”

“That’s right. Li Mubai and Nangong Wanyu are overconfident if they think they can suppress Lin Yun.” The intensity of the battles increased after Lin Yun went, especially when it was Yan Long’zi and Yu Haotian’s turn. If their opponents didn’t admit defeat, they would just kill their opponent in three moves.

Not long later after, Yan Long’zi, Zhao Wuji, and Yu Haotian’s dragon projection had also grown the same size as Lin Yun’s dragon. However, it seemed like they had reached the limit, which made everyone wonder if there would be a breakthrough.

Half an hour later, Lin Yun, who was meditating, suddenly woke up from an uproar that was even louder than when the three kings went up to the stage. When he opened his eyes, he instantly knew what was going on.

All attention was on the second group where Yue Weiwei was matched with Qing Ruoyou. Both of them were quite popular and had terrifying strength, especially Yue Weiwei whose appearance was exceptionally outstanding. People even thought they could make it into the top ten.

Qing Ruoyou was also gorgeous, but she was unfortunate because she was placed on the same stage as Yue Weiwei.

“It’s uncomfortable for me to look at that face of yours.” Qing Ruoyou said coldly with a killing aura flashing in her eyes. She was already unhappy with Yue Weiwei when she noticed that Yue Weiwei was pretty close to Lin Yun. This reminded her of Su Ziyao.

She had no idea where Su Ziyao went. Even worse, Su Ziyao was backed by the Falling Aquatic Empyrean. However, Yue Weiwei was right in front of her, so she would rip Yue Weiwei’s face to shreds in front of Lin Yun.

“Big sister, what do you mean?” Yue Weiwei smiled and gave off a pathetic aura.

“Don’t bother using your seduction techniques on me. I will let you off if you admit defeat. Otherwise, don’t blame me for being ruthless. You can only blame yourself for being too close to Lin Yun!” Qing Ruoyou said in a chilly tone, which made everyone feel uncomfortable.

The battle between Yue Weiwei and Qing Ruoyou wasn’t as simple as everyone thought. Many people’s eyes flickered as they fell into deep thoughts. Although Qing Ruoyou’s grudge with Lin Yun and Su Ziyao had been suppressed by the Indigomoon Elysium, there were still bits and pieces that leaked to the public. So when the crowd noticed the killing aura in Qing Ruoyou’s eyes, they instantly knew that the rumours were true.

“How domineering. Then let me see how ruthless you are.” Yue Weiwei smiled, but her eyes also had a trace of chill and mockery.
