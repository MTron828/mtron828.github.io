Chapter 1707 – Lead The Way

In the beginning, Lin Yun was worried that Yue Weiwei might recognize him and that he might bring trouble to her and the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion. But when they both smiled at each other, Lin Yun inwardly bitterly smiled because he knew that Yue Weiwei had already recognized him.

Even An Liuyan could see through his disguise, so how could Yue Weiwei not see through it? He could change his face, but his personality and feelings when he saw an acquaintance wouldn’t change. Not to mention that this wasn’t his first time seeing Yue Weiwei.

In this period, he often played the Ni Chang Dress Song at the summit of the snowy mountain, and it was hard to ensure that Yue Weiwei hadn’t recognized him then. If she only had a speculation before, she practically had confirmation now.

But Yue Weiwei didn’t expose his identity because she knew his current position. It was pretty good this way, and it was fine that they both had a rapport between themselves.

After Yue Weiwei gave Lin Yun a smile from the crowd, she quietly backed off and disappeared. Lin Yun’s heart dropped. He wanted to chase after her by instinct. But he fell to the ground when he stepped off the platform and felt powerless. His head felt heavy, and his entire world was spinning.

When his consciousness began to fade, he instantly realized that he had drunk a little too much. Just when the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s disciples were about a step forth, a figure descended and grabbed Lin Yun before disappearing from the hall.

Lin Wan and Luo Shuyi breathed a sigh of relief because Mu Xueling had brought Lin Yun away. With the Saint Elder around, Lin Yun should be fine.

After Mu Xueling brought Lin Yun to the summit of the snowy mountain, she threw Lin Yun to the ground. The chill and the strong impact made Lin Yun sober up a little, but his vision was still blurred when he looked at Mu Xueling. He could see multiple Mu Xuelings overlapping one another, and he couldn’t focus, no matter what.

At the same time, a burning sensation began to spread throughout his body. He could feel his entire body burning as if the fire had been accumulating for a thousand years, and it was entirely being released within his body now.

This made Mu Xueling, who was concerned in the beginning, furrow her brows. When she held onto Lin Yun’s wrist and sent wisps of her saint dao into Lin Yun’s body, she finally understood what was happening after she saw Lin Yun’s injuries. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

When Mu Xueling’s palm fell onto Lin Yun’s chest, a chilling white light poured into Lin Yun’s body, and the chilling light contained saint dao. The domineering chill instantly suppressed the blazing flames within Lin Yun’s body.

Lin Yun slowly opened his eyes, and the blurred Mu Xueling within his sight gradually sharpened. He asked, “What’s wrong with me?”

“The Myriad Flowers Wine is a thousand-year-old saint wine, and a mouthful is usually the limit for others to drink. You drank the entire jar, so the saint aura contained within the wine is exploding within your body.” Mu Xueling explained.

“Is that so?” Lin Yun scratched his head.

“It’s nothing big, and you should be able to absorb it with your saint physique. But I just checked your body, and two of your dragon pulses have practically been destroyed. Since you can’t improve your cultivation, you can’t absorb this saint aura.” Mu Xueling continued to explain.

“So I nearly burst apart?” Lin Yun’s face changed.

“More or less. It’s not safe now, and I can only suppress it for you.” Mu Xueling replied.

Letting out a breath of relief, Lin Yun knew he should be saved now, looking at Mu Xueling’s expression.

“You have two choices. I can help you disperse the wine within your body, or I can fuse the saint aura into your physique so that you can refine it when your injuries are recovered.” Mu Xueling said. “Brewing the Myriad Flowers Wine really takes a thousand years when compared to the Mo Clan’s Millennium Flame.”

“I pick the latter.” Lin Yun soon made a choice.

“That works. But you have to promise me something.” Mu Xueling said.

“Saint Elder, please go ahead.”

“I examined your injuries earlier, and your dragon pulses are severely damaged. It’s practically incurable, and it’s not caused by external factors. So I have my doubts and want to see if you have a dragon bone. You know what I mean.” Mu Xueling said.

“Saint Elder, you don’t even believe the Heavenly Origin Mirror? Not to mention that Saint Elder can examine me based on my current condition, so you don’t have to ask me.” Lin Yun smiled.

“Do you agree, or do you not?” Mu Xueling interrupted.

“Go ahead.” Lin Yun removed his shirt straightaway.

Mu Xueling briefly hesitated before she placed her hand on Lin Yun’s chest. Her fair hand was cold, but Mu Xueling could clearly sense Lin Yun’s heartbeat.

When Mu Xueling’s hand fell onto his chest, Lin Yun secretly circulated the Divine Tortoise Transformation, completely concealing the Blue Dragon Bone and transforming it into an ordinary bone.

Mu Xueling was confused as she examined Lin Yun’s body. When her palm fell onto Lin Yun’s chest earlier, she had already sensed a powerful dragon aura. But Lin Yun wasn’t entirely conscious earlier, and she didn’t like to probe someone’s privacy in that manner. But when her saint dao poured into Lin Yun’s body, she became puzzled after she couldn’t sense any dragon bone.

“Saint Elder, are you done?” Lin Yun asked.

“I’m done.” Mu Xueling retracted her hand with her face blushing. Strictly speaking, this was her first time having such intimate contact with a man. So she couldn’t help feeling bashful, even when she was half a step into the Saint Realm.

“You really don’t have a dragon bone… How can your Azure Dragon Saint Physique be that strong, then?” Mu Xueling couldn’t help asking.

“I refined a droplet of a Divine Dragon’s blood.” Lin Yun explained. That was the truth because the Azure Dragon Lord did give him a droplet of Divine Dragon’s blood back in the Ancient Barren Battlefield.

“It makes sense now, then.” Mu Xueling nodded. “Well, I don’t care if you’re Flower Burial, since I won’t do anything to you. But I would have to make preparations to ensure that the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion won’t be in trouble because of you. This is the reason why I have to verify.”

“I understand.” Lin Yun smiled. He had interacted with Mu Xueling, and he understood her rather well. He could trust her, but not everyone else in the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion.

“You can go now. I have suppressed the Myriad Flowers Wine’s saint aura for you, which has fused into your physique. Even if your injuries don’t recover, the saint aura will gradually merge with your body as time passes.” Mu Xueling said.

Lin Yun was briefly stunned before he smiled. Mu Xueling was rather adorable.

“Alright, but I have to leave for a few days, so I won’t be able to play for the Profound Fairy during this period. It will take about three days to half a month, but I’ll surely come back.” Lin Yun said after taking a deep breath.

What happened today gave him a wake-up call, and he couldn’t delay healing his injuries any longer. So he decided to make a trip to the Heavenly Star Pavilion.

Mu Xueling glanced at Lin Yun before gently nodded her head.

Returning to his residence, Lin Yun briefly rested before looking for Gu Jun.

Upon seeing Lin Yun, Gu Jun smiled, “Hehe, at least you have some conscience to remember me.”

He had already heard what happened in the Cloud Fragrance Hall. Lin Yun chased away the Exquisite Court by himself, and even the pavilion master had secretly shown up. Lin Yun was a famous person in the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion.

“I need to go out.” Lin Yun said.

“For what reason?” Gu Jun asked, squinting his eyes.

Lin Yun didn’t answer, and he gave the latter a Profound Saint Pellet. “Remember our previous agreement?”

“Hahaha. Of course, I remember.” Gu Jun smiled, and snatched the Profound Saint Pellet. With that, he almost took back all the Profound Saint Pellets he lost to Lin Yun. If he could find an opportunity to con a few more from Lin Yun, he might even be able to make a profit.

“Let’s go!” The two left the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion and went to the Heavenly Star Pavilion. The entire journey was smooth, without any accidents, and they swiftly arrived at the Heavenly Star Pavilion.

Along the way, Lin Yun wondered if he was overly suspicious. Regardless of the Exquisite Court or Jiang Yu, none of them did anything, which was really weird.

“The Heavenly Star Pavilion? Why did you come here?” Gu Jun asked.

In the Vermillion Bird District, the Heavenly Star Pavilion was a rather famous chamber of commerce, and its position wasn’t at all inferior to the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion.

“Wait for me outside.” Lin Yun recollected his thoughts and entered the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion.

This made Gu Jun’s lips twitch because Lin Yun was really rude, and he even wanted to give Lin Yun a beating.

When Lin Yun entered the Heavenly Star Pavilion, he took out the card that An Liuyan gave him, successfully entering the core region of the Heavenly Star Pavilion. Every single Heavenly Star Pavilion had such a place, a massive lake with a cauldron at the bottom of it. On the lake were various buildings that decorated the lake.

Lin Yun waited there for a long time. Just when he was wondering if he should leave after waiting for a long time, Mo Ling’er appeared. Mo Ling’er was a trusted aide of An Liuyan, and Lin Yun asked, “Is Lady An busy?”

“Yeah. She’s meeting a guest right now.” Mo Ling’er said in an unnatural tone.

Lowering his head to take a sip of the tea made Lin Yun furrow his brows, and he said, “Who is this guest?”

“Please be patient. That guest doesn’t like to be disrupted.” Mo Ling’er said anxiously.

“Bring me there.” Lin Yun said after lowering the cup.

“That’s…” Mo Ling’er’s face was ugly.

“Lead the way!” Lin Yun repeated with his face sinking.

Seeing this, Mo Ling’er didn’t dare to look at Lin Yun straight in the eyes, and she could only lead the way for Lin Yun.
