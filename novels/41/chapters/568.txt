Chapter 569 - My Sword, Freezing Like Snow

Everyone’s jaw dropped when they saw the decapitated head flying in the air. Everyone was familiar with that head, but it felt unreal. After all, they had a deep impression of Luo Shen’s strength, who crushed Mu Xue from the Heavenly Sword Sect.

Mu Xue nearly lost her life earlier and the crowd could vividly recall that scene. But this time around, Luo Shen had actually lost his life. Furthermore, Lin Yun had only used three swords to claim Luo Shen’s life.

What was even more shocking was that Lin Yun had already turned around. He didn’t even spare a glance at Luo Shen’s corpse. As for the three participants who were charging towards Lin Yun, they all felt their hearts being hammered when they saw the head flying behind Lin Yun.

They still couldn’t believe that Luo Shen was dead. At this moment, they could feel a chill run down their spines as Lin Yun’s killing aura made their faces pale.

“Retreat!” The shock they felt from Lin Yun had disrupted their momentum, so they knew that it was courting death to continue to charge at Lin Yun right now. However, Lin Yun wouldn’t give them the chance to retreat. Without any hesitation, he stabbed out with his sword towards the three participants.

It was a bizarre scene. An azure-clothed youth was forcing back Cao Xiu, Bai Yuchen, and Chen Yu all by himself.

“Screw it!” Knowing that there was no path of retreat, the three participants roared as they launched their attacks towards Lin Yun.

However, Lin Yun seemed to have predicted their attacks as he chopped his sword downwards, leaving a gash on their arms. This made them groan out in pain, but Lin Yun didn’t stop there as he continued to charge forward.

In the next second, Chen Yu was stabbed in the chest and was sent flying. However, Cao Xiu and Bai Yuchen’s eyes lit up at this opportunity as they stepped forward and launched their strongest attacks.

But things naturally wouldn’t go their way as Lin Yun spread his arms apart and soared into the sky. Then, using the momentum, he dove back down with his sword. This caused Cao Xiu and Bai Yuchen to miss their attacks. Instead, their attacks made a huge crater in the ground.

Before the two of them could get away, Lin Yun swung his sword, unleashing a radiant moon. It was naturally the Luminous Moon from the Aquaselenic Sword technique.

Further empowered by the Iris Sword Sutra, the power of his attack was unbelievably strong. Lin Yun’s sword tore apart their defences and left gashes on their bodies.

“H-how did he manage to do this?” Cao Xiu and Bai Yuchen were shocked that Lin Yun’s attack managed to injure them despite the fact that they defended together. It made no sense for Lin Yun to be so powerful with his cultivation only in the pinnacle Yin stage. Just what cultivation technique did he learn?

“What a terrifying sword. You know, this doesn’t seem to be Lin Yun’s strongest attack. His cultivation technique must be powerful.”

“I’m afraid that it’s not that simple. The xiantian sword intent is terrifying, to begin with. But did you notice that Lin Yun’s sword intent is near completion?”

“Now, it makes sense why his attack is so powerful.”

The brutality on the stage had plucked everyone’s heartstrings. The strength that Lin Yun had displayed made everyone’s eyes light up. After all, not even the Bloodwing Pavilion and Shattered Sword Pavilion in the Nether Prefectural City could nurture such a monstrous genius.

When Jiang Yi heard the surrounding discussion, he shook his head lightly. These people weren’t wrong, but they all neglected something…

Lin Yun’s reversal of the situation wasn’t just because Luo Shen died. If the remaining three participants worked together, they would still have at least a 60% chance of winning. But Luo Shen’s death had left a trauma in their hearts, which gave Lin Yun the upperhand. The most important factor was Lin Yun’s mentality. He was calm and composed, which fully displayed the grace of a swordsman.

Everyone from the Heavenly Province Academy was also shocked by this scene. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“What a terrifying sword technique.”

“Great! Luo Shen is dead!”

“Haha, well done!”

“Senior Sister Mo’s eyesight is unique indeed. Even if we lose the competition, no one will dare to underestimate our academy!”

“That’s right. How many people can accomplish what Lin Yun just did?” All of them were excited while watching Lin Yun’s battle. Mu Xue was lying on the chair as she opened her eyes weakly. Her vision was blurred, but she could still identify the people on the stage. Right at this moment, she suddenly recalled how she tried to intimidate Lin Yun with her initial xiantian sword intent.

With Lin Yun’s strength, he could easily embarrass her in front of Tang Yu if he was willing to. Thinking about it, she couldn’t help but feel guilty that she had wronged Lin Yun.

Back on the stage, when Lin Yun forced Cao Xiu and Bai Yuchen back, he didn’t notice the venomous gaze on him. The gaze came from Chen Yu, who suffered a stab from Lin Yun.

“Die!” The fan in Chen Yu’s hand turned into a violet bolt of lightning as it flew towards Lin Yun’s chest. He had been preparing this attack for a long time, so he was confident that he could heavily injure Lin Yun.

Just when his fan was about to reach Lin Yun, it exploded into twelve thin blades aimed at Lin Yun’s lethal spots. Looking at this scene, Chen Yu began to laugh out aloud, “Haha, Lin Yun, you’re dead!”

But Lin Yun suddenly turned around as he swung out eighty-one sword rays that bloomed like an Iris Flower, knocking all twelve thin blades away. This caught Chen Yu by surprise as the thin blades stabbed his own vital spots, making him look like a hedgehog.

A thin blade in his forehead ended up claiming his life. Chen Yu’s face turned pale as he could sense his vitality being drained away.

“I hate sneak attacks the most.” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with a chill as he recalled how Xin Jue died. He turned into a sword ray and pierced through Chen Yu’s body, destroying Chen Yu’s body completely so that his corpse was unrecognizable.

When Chen Yu’s mutilated limbs fell onto the ground, waves and waves of sword aura eventually reduced what was left of Chen Yu’s corpse into ashes. With that, the White Jade Academy’s Chen Yu died an even more terrible death than Luo Shen.

This made everyone’s face twitch in shock. They could tell how ruthless Lin Yun’s attack was, but they didn’t know what Chen Yu did to Lin Yun to deserve this. Simultaneously, everyone from the White Jade Academy had their faces turn black with deep hatred in their eyes. They didn’t know where Lin Yun came from.

“Bai Yuchen, don’t hold back anymore. Otherwise, we might end up like them.” Cao Xiu wiped the blood on his lips and he smiled bitterly as he looked at Lin Yun. This was too brutal. They initially thought that they could gang up and kill Lin Yun, but the situation had completely turned around. Hell Mode had become their hell instead. On top of that, the White Jade Academy was humiliated and was going to become Lin Yun’s stepping stone.

But Cao Xiu didn’t want that. He wanted Lin Yun to die no matter what. Mustering his killing aura, Cao Xiu’s eyes became sharp.

Standing beside Cao Xiu, Bai Yuchen also looked at Lin Yun coldly, “Fine with me. I have no intention of going easy anymore. We won’t be able to turn the tables around today if he doesn’t die…”

But before he could finish speaking, a sword ray streaked across the stage and Cao Xiu was severed in two before he brought out his trump card. This instantly made Bai Yuchen’s legs turn soft and his lips tremble. He recognized Lin Yun’s sword as the one that forced Jiang Yi to surrender.

Overlord Sword—Thunderbolt Slasher!

The rumbling sound from the sword intent started to ring out, but Cao Xiu was already dead. Everyone was fixated on Lin Yun as he slowly walked towards Bai Yuchen. It was just like how Lin Yun walked towards the four participants at the beginning of Hell Mode.
