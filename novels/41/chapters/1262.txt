Chapter 1263 - Demoness (2)

“The Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect is finished…”

“This place is destined to be turned into a river of blood, and none of them will be able to escape.”

“What a pity. Those two women are really gorgeous.” The crowd following the Azure Thunder Sect’s party shook their heads and sighed.

When the Azure Thunder Sect’s disciples flew over, their faces were dark.

“Is there anything we can help you guys with?” Jiang Lichen asked before he continued, “I’m the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s Senior Brother, Jiang Lichen.”

“Nothing much. I only want you guys to kneel, beg for mercy, and pay blood for blood.” A black-clothed youth from the Azure Thunder Sect’s party barked with a cold smirk.

“I believe we haven’t done anything to offend you guys, right?” Jiang Lichen said with his brows locked together. He wasn’t happy with the other party’s tone because it made him feel uncomfortable.

“You guys dare to do that but don’t dare to admit it?” The black-clothed youth coldly said. “Lin Yun killed a core disciple of my Azure Thunder Sect and even broke a saint artifact that belonged to us.”

Jiang Lichen was briefly stunned before he replied, “We do.”

His decisiveness left all the disciples of the Azure Thunder Sect shocked and didn’t know how to continue. Even the crowd gathered around were shocked and felt that something wasn’t right somewhere. Shouldn’t Jiang Lichen’s group beg for mercy? Why did they admit it so straightforwardly and didn’t even ask what happened?

“Leave the women behind. As for the men, kill them all,” said Lan Kong, who was the leader of the Azure Thunder Sect.

“Hehe. I have the same thoughts.” The black-clothed youth snickered. “Today, we’ll let Lin Yun know the consequences of offending the Azure Thunder Sect!”

When he was done, he pushed his palm out. The power behind his palm was terrifying, being enveloped with lightning and azure flames. When the lightning and azure flames combined together, a simple palm was accompanied by great power.

Jiang Lichen immediately circulated his astral energy and faced this palm head-on. When the two palms collided, the collision caused a huge explosion.

The powerful gale made Jiang Lichen’s hair flutter in the wind as he wore a grave expression. But he didn’t take a single step back. On the other hand, the black-clothed youth was careless and was forced to take several steps back. This made his face change and become ugly.

“You’re courting death!” The black-clothed youth roared and unleashed another attack. But this time, he had summoned his constellation with a painting spreading out behind him.

“Let me do it.” Just when Jiang Lichen was about to retaliate, a voice resounded and Ye Ziling flew over. As purple flames formed into a flower in her pupils, she began to brightly shine, making the surroundings light up brightly like a bright sun.

While she was enveloped in lightning, this made Ye Ziling even more stunning in her purple dress. When she attacked, she also pushed out a palm and faced the black-clothed youth’s constellation head-on.

In the next second, a terrifying scene took place. When they clashed, the black-clothed youth’s right hand burst into a blood mist and blood flowed from his shoulder. This made the black-clothed youth scream out in pain as he fell, rolling onto the ground.

“My hand!” The black-clothed youth wailed out in pain as he rolled on the ground.

“Junior Brother Chang!” The other disciples of the Azure Thunder Sect’s faces changed. When their gazes fell onto Ye Ziling, they flew into a rage, “You deserve to die!”

In the next second, all of them charged toward Ye Ziling, wanting to gang up on her and make her pay for what she had done.

But Ye Ziling joined her hands together and began to circulate the Radiant Snow Bloodline. When she circulated her bloodline, the Radiant Snow Flower within her pupils instantly became colder.

As one flower after another flew from her body, they emitted a bright glow. When the flowers bloomed, all the Azure Thunder Sect’s disciples who charged forth were instantly sent flying back.

They were all covered in wounds with the pain they suffered distorting their faces. In just one second, they had instantly lost their power to fight.

The power that Ye Ziling unleashed was terrifying and this made the remaining two people from the Azure Thunder Sect’s faces change. Fear loomed over their hearts and they also began to tremble.

As for the surrounding cultivators who followed behind the Azure Thunder Sect, they were left dumbfounded by this scene with their jaws wide open. At this moment, they began to wonder what kind of sect the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect was since Ye Ziling was a little too unreasonably strong.

They all heard that Lin Yun was ruthless and didn’t even hesitate to kill a woman from the Azure Thunder Sect. But this scene simply made their scalps go numb since Ye Ziling was no different from a demoness in their eyes.

This scene also made Jiang Lichen, Feng Zhang, and Liu Qingyan’s lips twitch. They knew that this senior sister of theirs was a little violent. After all, she was someone who had been bearing the entire Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect on her shoulders all this time, and her decisiveness to kill wasn’t inferior to any man.

But after she became stronger, that decisive and ruthless part of her seemed to be even stronger. Even Lan Kong, the leader of the Azure Thunder Sect’s party, was completely dumbfounded and could no longer maintain his composure.

Right at this moment, the other Azure Thunder Sect’s disciple standing beside Lan Kong turned his cold gaze to Luo Hua. He could feel that Ye Ziling wasn’t a pushover, so his gaze fell onto Luo Hua.

Based on Luo Hua’s dress and temperament alone, he could tell that Luo Hua definitely had a noble status. So he believed that he could threaten Ye Ziling as long as he could capture that woman.

But just when he took a step forth, Luo Hua couldn’t even be bothered to bat an eye at him and pushed her palm out towards him. This instantly made the youth freeze in mid-air before his body blew apart and his blood splashed across Lan Kong’s face.

This scene made the audience members take in another cold breath with their faces instantly turning pale. Their scalps even went numb, and they could feel that their hearts were on the verge of bursting out of their chests. They began to wonder where this other demoness came from, since she was also a little too terrifying.

When Jiang Lichen, Feng Zhang, and Liu Qingyan’s gazes fell onto Lan Kong, this instantly made him feel as if he was being surrounded by a pack of wolves. At this moment, he was weak, pitiful, helpless, and he could only tremble in fear.

Without any hesitation, he turned and ran for his life. He seemed pretty proficient at running away, judging from how far he ran.

“Let him go. He only knows how to cause trouble and not clean up his mess. It’s time to teach him a lesson,” said Luo Hua.

Jiang Lichen, Feng Zhang, Liu Qingyan, and Ye Ziling could naturally tell that Luo Hua was talking about Lin Yun. Furthermore, they could even tell from her tone that she was a little angry and unhappy.

“Even so, we can’t let him leave that easily,” said Ye Ziling before she swung her sword out.

When she drew her sword, a sword vibration echoed before a sword ray flew out like a divine dragon, instantly catching up to Lan Kong. With a huge collision, Lan Kong was sent flying by the sword ray and collided against a distant hill.

The hill that Lan Kong landed on instantly collapsed with him buried under the crumbling hill. This instantly left all the spectators dumbfounded once more with their mouths wide open. They couldn’t comprehend what just happened because the disciples of the Azure Thunder Sect seemed to have been annihilated right before their eyes.

When they recovered from their shock, their faces greatly changed and they immediately fled for their lives. After all, Ye Ziling and Luo Hua were too terrifying. They instantly imprinted in their minds that Lin Yun’s women…no, the women of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect couldn’t be offended because they were all demonesses.
