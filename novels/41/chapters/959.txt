Chapter 960 - Dragon Gate's War Sovereign!

All of the Demon Slaughter Realm cultivators were feeling upset because they didn’t go with the elites. After all, there was a high possibility that the corpse might have a Divine Core. The corpse might even have a few dao artifacts and martial techniques on it.

But most importantly, there might have been a trace of dao rhyme. Naturally, no one would feel happy if they missed out on such treasures.

Suddenly, the Demon Slaughter Realm’s elites, as well as Xu Que, ran out of the demonic fog. They were covered in wounds that matched their pathetic state. Even worse was the fact that Xu Que’s face was as white as a ghost. What just happened?

What happened to the elites and Xu Que? Everyone was curious about the heavy injuries, but no one dared to say anything in fear of Xu Que’s ferocious reputation.

“Damn it! Where did that damned cat come from?!” Xu Que was still brooding over Lil’ Red showing up out of nowhere. If he knew that Lil’ Red was nearby, he wouldn’t have been so impulsive. Unfortunately, it was too late for regret. On top of that, he finally experienced Lin Yun’s real strength. Lin Yun’s fortune martial technique was enough to leave him in despair. In fact, if his cultivation wasn’t strong enough, he would have been killed.

“Damn it! I refuse to accept this!” Xu Que’s eyes flashed with reluctance. “Let’s go. I’m going to find Liu Mu. We’ll make Lin Yun pay!”

Despite his injuries, Xu Que was still full of schemes. It was clear for everyone that he held grudges.

“So it was because of Flower Burial Lin Yun!”

“He was there? I didn’t even notice him…”

“Haha, they deserved it.” Everyone took joy in Xu Que’s misfortune. Although they didn’t dare to enter with Lin Yun around, it was better to lose to Lin Yun than the Demon Slaughter Realm.

Lin Yun passed through the demonic corpses in the surroundings and headed towards the massive stone. But just when he was about to get close, an invisible dragon aura spread out as a majestic dragon appeared before Lin Yun. Its eyes were radiating brightly with a glare that froze Lin Yun in his tracks.

It was as his entire soul would be shattered by the dragon aura. However, a sword hum echoed from Lin Yun’s body. His sky sword intent had revealed itself upon being threatened.

Golden flames blazed in the depth of Lin Yun’s pupils, causing the entire world’s aura to fuse into the sword aura. Then, the aura collided with the dragon aura.

After a while, the dragon head slowly dissipated. Lin Yun’s face was still pale, but he was able to sigh in relief. He knew he would run into some dangers, but he had the sky sword intent to save his life.Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

When Lin Yun looked at the large stone again, he could sense that the dragon aura was a little weaker than before. Not wasting any time, Lin Yun descended on the stone. But when he stepped onto the stone, he could feel an immense pressure trying to force him to kneel.

Raising his head to look at the azure-clothed man standing at the center of the stone, Lin Yun exclaimed, “How young!”

Because of the powerful aura, he had mistaken the cultivator as an old man or senior. Instead, he was met with someone who looked to be a few years older than him. Can someone so young transcend the Empyrean Realm?

Lin Yun never would have expected meeting a top-tier genius from the Golden Era by chance.

Lin Yun was also able to sense the lingering dao in the atmosphere. Suddenly, a bolt of lightning flashed across the horizon, lighting up everything.

When the lightning flashed, the azure-clothed man became clear as day. And as soon as the bolt of lightning was about to dissipate, the azure-clothed man suddenly opened his eyes. BOundless radiance shined, which made Lin Yun’s heart beat wildly.

Just when he was feeling anxious, he was shocked to discover that he was in a barren land. All around him were demonic fiends that were charging at the azure-clothed man.

“Glory Iris Flower, Brilliant Shine!” The azure-clothed man raised his hand and hundreds of Iris Flowers bloomed behind him. With a flick of his finger, hundreds of demonic fiends were pierced in the forehead and died. The azure-clothed man looked incredibly mighty, despite his grave expression.

Then, Lin Yun noticed a massive array on the ground. Additionally, corpses littered the ground around the azure-clothed man. It turned out that his companions died and the array on the ground could shatter at any moment.

“Baili Qi, will you surrender?!” A majestic voice echoed from the horizon with enormous pressure.

“The Dragon Gate’s War Sovereign will die fighting! I, Baili Qi, won’t surrender!” The azure-clothed man didn’t hesitate as fighting spirit emitted from his body. His aura rose violently and broke through the boundary of the Empyrean Realm. In a last ditch effort, he managed to reach the Divine Core Realm.

But the moment he reached the Divine Core Realm, a gigantic demonic claw descended. The claw was covered with terrifying scales and sinister patterns. As it descended, heaven and earth instantly shattered.

Lin Yun woke up from the vision and immediately threw up. “I’m still alive?”

When the demonic claw descended, he felt like he died. But when he looked around, he realized that the vision was just a scene from the ancient battle. However, he could still hear the words of the azure-clothed youth.

“If you want my Divine Core, you will have to succeed in my karma. No matter who you are, you will succeed the will of the Dragon Gate’s War Sovereign. There’s no way you can avoid this karma. Are you willing?” A voice sounded out in Lin Yun’s ears. Surprised, Lin Yun raised his head, but the azure-clothed man’s eyes were still closed.

Clearly, it was the azure-clothed man’s lingering will. Anyone who approached him would hear the same question as long as they had the qualification to watch the vision.

Taking a deep breath, Lin Yun said, “I’m willing. If the demonic fiends descend in the future, I’m willing to fight to my last breath with the sword in my hand!”

When Lin Yun said that, the azure-clothed figure faded away as it left behind a blazing Divine Core.
