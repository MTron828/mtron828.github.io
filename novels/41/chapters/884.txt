Chapter 885 - Shaking the Entire Thunderflame City

The cold voice rang in everyone’s ears. When Lin Yun said something similar a moment ago, everyone treated him as a joke. But now, no one had any doubts about Lin Yun.

There weren’t many with the tribulation qualification in Thunderflame City, and Feng Xuan was one of the strongest among those who were qualified. So how could Feng Xuan get tossed by a youth from the Profound Amber Realm whose cultivation was in the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm?

Although everyone could tell that Feng Xuan barely used 30% of his strength, no one knew how much strength Lin Yun used. Many people had playful expressions as they watched the bizarre scene unfold. After all, the Flamecloud Realm offended many people every day.

They initially thought Lin Yun would boost Feng Xuan’s prestige, but it seemed like the fight wouldn’t be so simple. At this moment, all of the first soul Heavenly Soul Realm experts were gazing at Lin Yun with interest.

Feng Xuan, who was lying on the ground, swiftly stood up. Watching Lin Yun walk out of the flames, his face sank, “No wonder you killed Yan Tie. I really underestimated you. No matter what, I’m taking your life!”

“I don’t think you’ll be able to,” sneered Lin Yun as he circulated the Azure Firmament Sword Sutra. Lightning origin energy surged out of his body as an azure radiance shined with his sword aura.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“You’re courting death. I barely used 30% of my strength!” Feng Xuan’s face sank because he was embarrassed by his earlier blunder. He was determined to use all his strength to end this battle quickly. Otherwise, it would be tough for him to maintain his footing in Thunderflame City.

Flame runes started enveloping his palm as a powerful blazing aura spread out. When his aura reached its pinnacle, Feng Xuan charged over and unleashed a huge wave of flames at Lin Yun. If it weren’t for the statue’s pressure, the entire plaza would be enveloped in flames.

“Looks like Feng Xuan is getting serious now!”

“The control of his flame intent is really meticulous.”

“His foundation is deep. It won’t be easy for Lin Yun to overcome the gap of talent and comprehension.”

“Lin Yun seems to be in trouble.” After seeing that Feng Xuan was no longer holding back, everyone became worried. As for the disciples from Flamecloud Realm, they had pride on their faces because they were certain that Lin Yun would be killed within three moves.

“The Profound Amber Realm is basically a lower realm. There’s no way it compares to my Flamecloud Realm. All of you are about to see how weak you are compared to us.” The Flamecloud Realm’s disciples looked at Fang Shaoyu, Zhao Chen, and Zhu Qingshan with disdain.

The Flamecloud Realm disciples acted arrogantly as if Feng Xuan was never sent flying. Lin Yun, however, didn’t panic and threw a punch out.

As the punches collided, terrifying shockwaves spread out with flames and sword rays flying around. Everyone had to retreat a few hundred meters away to avoid the attacks. As for Lin Yun, he took three steps back with each step dissipating the violent origin energy from his collision with Feng Xuan.

“Hehe. It must feel terrible, right? Don’t worry because this is just the beginning!” Feng Xuan’s expression became sinister as his origin energy fluctuated. When the heatwave spread out, the air started to distort from the high temperature.

In the blink of an eye, they exchanged several moves that made the plaza tremble. Lin Yun was surprised because Feng Xuan was capable. This meant that Feng Xuan’s cultivation technique wasn’t any inferior to the Azure Firmament Sword Sutra. With Feng Xuan’s flame intent, there was no way Lin Yun’s xiantian sword intent could get close to Feng Xuan.

Lin Yun’s sword intent started to melt before it even got close to Feng Xuan. Although Lin Yun was only using xiantian sword intent, it was still the first time someone was able to melt his sword intent.

“Wow, you were able to cultivate your xiantian sword intent to this level without reaching the Heavenly Soul Realm. You really do have the qualification to be arrogant. But you’re still too inexperienced compared to me!” Feng Xuan laughed as his flame intent turned into a ferocious beast that descended onto Lin Yun.

When the ferocious beast and Feng Xuan’s palm combined, the plaza lit up with flames. At this moment, Feng Xuan smiled and threw a punch at Lin Yun’s head. With his ruthless attack, there was no doubt that Lin Yun’s head would burst if the attack landed.

Lin Yun didn’t have any panic on his face and sneered, “Xiantian sword intent? I guess you have no idea how your friends from the Flamecloud Realm died.”

“Immortal Azure Dragon Sword Intent!” Lin Yun roared as his spiritual sword intent and immortal azure dragon aura combined together to form a thirty meter long azure dragon. With just a glare from its eyes, the flames that enveloped the entire plaza shattered. Furthermore, Lin Yun was only using his spiritual sword intent in lesser mastery. However, since it was the immortal azure dragon aura, it far exceeded Feng Xuan’s flame intent.

With no hesitation, Lin Yun faced Feng Xuan’s attack head-on. Feng Xuan’s punch only lasted for a split second before cracks started to spread out on the flaming beast behind him with signs of collapsing.

When Feng Xuan was sent flying, he had a deep shock in his eyes. Spiritual sword intent? How? How can someone from the Profound Amber Realm grasp the spiritual sword intent before reaching the Heavenly Soul Realm?!

Without any hesitation, Feng Xuan flipped in mid-air and quickly retreated. But before he could retreat, Lin Yun’s eyes flashed brightly and barked, “You think you can escape? Sword!”

The Flower Burial Sword flew into his hand as it exploded with dazzling sword rays. At the same time, Lin Yun circulated both his sword sutras and powerful origin energy poured out.

The Azure Firmament Tree appeared behind him with Iris Flowers on the branches. Immediately, Lin Yun’s sword intent enveloped the entire plaza. An azure-purple sword ray poured out of Lin Yun’s body with power comparable to a first soul Heavenly Soul Realm expert.

“Greater mastery of spiritual sword intent!”

“How the hell did he manage to do that? It’s too terrifying to grasp the spiritual sword intent at such a high level before reaching the Heavenly Soul Realm. T-this is too unbelievable!”

“Not only that! There’s also something weird about his cultivation technique. It isn’t inferior in any way to greater fortune cultivation techniques!”

Exclamations rang out in the entire plaza as many people were shocked by the sword intent coming from Lin Yun. No one had expected that a young man in the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm would be so strong. In the next second, Lin Yun’s Flower Burial Sword caught up to Feng Xuan.

As blood splattered, Lin Yun’s sword ray whipped out like a dragon tail. Feng Xuan was sent flying with a wound so deep that his bones were showing.

H-how is this possible?! Everyone from the Flamecloud Realm was dumbfounded. How was Feng Xuan almost severed in two?

Even Feng Xuan was shocked as fear flashed in his eyes. But he ultimately suppressed his injuries and roared, “This is the end! Flamecloud Incinerating Palm!”

Six ancient flaming seals appeared on his palm as his aura rose violently. Behind him, purple flames began to revolve at a terrifying speed and a purple flaming palm reached out at Lin Yun. The second the flaming palm appeared, the entire plaza began to tremble violently.

The Flamecloud Incinerating Palm was rather infamous in Thunderflame City. But no one had expected that Feng Xuan could actually summon six seals at once.

On the other hand, Lin Yun was surprised that someone managed to survive his sword. This meant that his sword wasn’t fast enough.

“The Flamecloud Incinerating Palm? I also know how to use that martial technique!” The azure-purple sword rays coming from Lin Yun as four gold flaming seals appeared.

They couldn’t believe that Lin Yun also knew the Flamecloud Incinerating Palm, not to mention that he even reached the level of gold seals. This scene had completely left everyone from the Flamecloud Realm dumbfounded. They couldn’t believe that Lin Yun actually achieved a level that Feng Xuan couldn’t.

Lin Yun’s version of the Flamecloud Incinerating Palm was a lot smaller, but when it collided with the purple flaming palm, the purple flaming palm only lasted for a split second before it started to crumble. Countless purple flames started to burst like fireworks under the immense power of the gold flaming palm.

Then, the gold flaming palm reached Feng Xuan, instantly reducing him into a pile of meat. This scene sent chills down everyone’s spine because they couldn’t believe that Feng Xuan was dead. Even worse was the fact that Lin Yun used the fortune martial technique that belonged to the Flamecloud Realm!
