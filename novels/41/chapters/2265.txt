Chapter 2266 - A Clown

Li Feibai was furious after realizing that Lin Yun was teasing her, but she still followed him as he headed towards the Divine Phoenix Mountain group.

“Ji Zixi, it has been a long time since we last met,” Lin Yun smiled as he greeted Ji Zixi and those from the Divine Phoenix Mountain, not looking unfamiliar at all.

“Indeed. The last I saw you was on the ninth.” Ji Zixi was filled with emotions when she looked at Lin Yun again. After all, chaos had taken place in the Heavenly Dao Sect shortly after they met.

Others didn’t know the exact story and only knew that the Heavenly Dao Sect took a great blow after the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda had been seized by the Blood Moon Sect. From that day onwards, the Heavenly Dao Sect was no longer the strongest holy land in the Eastern Desolation, with their forces being seized by others.

At the same time, the news that Ye Qingtian was Lin Yun had also spread out, causing an uproar throughout the Kunlun Realm.

But when Ji Zixi looked at the smile on Lin Yun’s face, she aggrievedly said, “Why didn’t you come and look for me in the Heavenly Void? Do you still consider us as friends? I was heartbroken when I learned you had fallen into the Fallen God Valley.”

Her ambiguous tone made the faces of everyone from the Divine Phoenix Mountain change. Ji Zixi was the little princess of the Divine Phoenix Mountain, so how could she say that in public?

Li Feibai smiled when she saw this and jabbed Lin Yun with her elbow. “What did I say earlier? You still say that you have nothing to do with Ji Zixi?”

The old man beside Ji Zixi changed the topic, “We’re grateful that Flower Burial helped us deal with them.”

Lin Yun smiled, “The Blood Moon Sect is the Heavenly Dao Sect's mortal enemy, as well as the Kunlun Realm's public enemy. So you don’t have to be so courteous about it.”

“You still haven’t answered me yet!” Ji Zixi furiously said. She was still fuming, not wanting to let Lin Yun brush it off so easily.

“You said that you would visit Divine Phoenix Mountain. If you don’t make things clear today…” Ji Zixi didn’t continue any further because she was afraid that Lin Yun might take her seriously and say he wouldn’t come anymore.

“My identity was sensitive, and I didn’t want to walk around under the identity of Ye Qingtian. That is why I didn’t go to the Divine Phoenix Mountain.” Lin Yun had already prepared his answer before he continued, “But I have been observing from the dark, and I’m amongst the Divine Phoenix Mountain’s party this time. If the divine flames appear, I will do my best to help the Divine Phoenix Mountain obtain it.”

The moment he said that, the eyes of everyone from the Divine Phoenix Mountain lit up, especially the old man beside Ji Zixi.

Ji Zixi’s face turned for the better, and she smiled, “That’s more like it.”

“Are you serious about that?” The old man asked.

Before Lin Yun could respond, Ji Zixi approached him, saying, “You think he does not dare to be serious in what he says? But… who is this?”

She naturally noticed Li Feibai, who was standing beside Lin Yun, wearing a mask and having a slender figure that looked mysterious.

“I’m a nobody, so you don’t have to pay any attention to me,” Li Feibai smiled.

“This is a friend of mine,” Lin Yun said.

“Since you are Young Master Lin’s friend, you are naturally our friend.” The old man from the Divine Phoenix Mountain said. The old man’s name was Ji Xinghe, an elder of the Ji Clan. This old man was mysterious, since Lin Yun couldn’t see through him.

Everyone from the Divine Phoenix Mountain was happy to hear that they would receive Lin Yun’s help. This was mainly because Lin Yun had proven his strength and had subdued everyone after displaying it. After all, strength was of utmost importance in the Kunlun Realm, especially for a swordsman like Lin Yun.

Lin Yun was calm as he said, “Zhao Tianyu and the Ying River King didn’t suffer any heavy injuries. They were probably here to probe everyone’s strength and will return anytime.”

“Ha. You know how to lift yourself. You have just defeated them and yet you praise their strength now.” Huang Jingyu and the other two holy lands came forth, with the surrounding atmosphere becoming tense.

“What is there to fear with five holy lands joining forces together? We can just break the restriction and wait for the divine flames to be released.” Huang Jingyu looked arrogant as he opened up the fan in his hand.

“Since you’re so powerful, why didn’t you stand out earlier?” Li Feibei retorted.

“There’s no need for me to use the trump card of my Ming Cult against the two of them. Everything went as I had expected. The Ying River King only looked tough and couldn’t even deal with a Quasi-Saint,” Huang Jingyu replied.

“What will you think if I tell you that the Ying River King is a Golden-Eyed Demonspirit?” Li Feibai revealed. Her words caused a sudden uproar.

The five holy lands, the saint clans, and everyone else were shocked after hearing what Li Feibai said.

“Golden-Eyed Demonspirit? How can that be…?”

“Now that I think about it, his aura didn’t look like someone who was just at the initial phase of the fourth-stage Saint Lord.”

“There’s a high possibility that he might really be a Golden-Eyed Demonspirit.”

“If he’s a Golden-Eyed Demonspirit, why did he leave so easily?” Discussions resounded from the surroundings, with everyone being shocked. Everyone here was a Saint Lord, so they knew what a Golden-Eyed Demonspirit represented. That was the royal lineage of the Demonspirit Clan, representing invincibility against those of the same cultivation.

There weren’t many Golden-Eyed Demonspirits, and a bloodbath and massacre would follow after each appearance. Ordinary Demonspirits were already tough to deal with. A Silver-Eyed Demonspirit would be more troublesome, not to mention a Golden-Eyed Demonspirit that only seemed to have existed in legends.

The faces of those from the Ming Cult, Myriad Lightning Sect, and Heavenly Flame Sect changed with disbelief.

Huang Jingyu was stunned before sneering, “If he’s really a Golden-Eyed Demonspirit, would Lin Yun still be alive now? Why would he retreat so easily?”

Huang Jingyu turned to look at Lin Yun. He naturally didn’t believe that Lin Yun could defeat a Golden-Eyed Demonspirit.

“Flower Burial, was he a Golden-Eyed Demonspirit?” Someone from the Divine Phoenix Clan asked.

“You can believe or not believe, whether you like it or not,” Lin Yun said.

“I believe you,” Ji Zixi said.

When Lin Yun raised his head and looked at Ji Zixi, he could see trust and a hint of admiration in her eyes.

“As if we would believe you,” Huang Jingyu said coldly.

Liu Yunlan and the Heavenly Kui Saint Lord fell into deep thoughts without saying a word.

Right then, the Ming Cult’s Heavenly Sage Saint Lord said, “Flower Burial, the Divine Blood Fruit must still be with you since you’re still alive, right?!”

His words caused an uproar since everyone nearly forgot about the Divine Blood Fruit. After all, the Heavenly Void had three great opportunities: the Divine Blood Fruit, the Blood Flame King’s treasures, and the divine flame fragments.

Lin Yun was by himself and had obtained the Divine Blood Fruit, not to mention what kind of opportunities he could have had in the Fallen God Valley.

“That’s right. The Divine Blood Fruit is in my hands, so you can snatch it from me if you have the capability.” Lin Yun raised his brow at the Heavenly Sage Saint Lord with murderous intent flashing in his eyes.

The Heavenly Sage Saint Lord, Crow Shot Saint Lord, and Indigo Brave Saint Lord were fourth-stage Saint Lords. Lin Yun didn’t forget the despair that he had felt when facing them back then. He would go after them, even if they didn’t come for him.

“Who dares?!” Ji Zixi said before the three Saint Lords could make a move, stepping forth with those from the Divine Phoenix Mountain, coldly looking at the three holy lands.

The Divine Phoenix Mountain wasn’t weak. If they fought, they would have no problem protecting Lin Yun.

Huang Jingyu looked at Ji Zixi, who was protecting Lin Yun. Recalling her indifference to him, he mocked, “Lin Yun, you’re someone who hides behind a woman?”

“Huang Jingyu, I advise you to behave yourself. You came here uninvited, and the Divine Phoenix Mountain isn’t afraid of you if you want to fall out.” Ji Zixi’s eyes flashed with a chilling light. She had been unhappy with Huang Jingyu for a long time.

As the atmosphere became tense, the saint clans and sects began taking sides, soon splitting into two factions within the Flame Dragon Valley. The three holy lands had a huge array, but the Divine Phoenix Mountain wasn’t inferior.

“The divine flame fragments will appear soon, so a fight might occur. So you guys might not want to fight right now to determine a victor,” Li Feibai said, adding oil to the fire.VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Hearing that, Huang Jingyu looked at Li Feibai coldly.

“The Ying River King might return, not to mention that the Blood Moon Sect won’t give up so easily. If we start a conflict between us right now, we will only benefit others instead,” Qu Wushuang said. “The ownership of the Divine Blood Fruit has ended, and the treasure naturally goes to capable people. You can’t possibly want to try and snatch whatever catches your eye, right? Speaking of which, the three of your holy lands have divided the Blood Flame King’s treasures, and yet you guys didn’t tell us what you obtained.”

Qu Wushuang wasn’t impartial with his words but was on Lin Yun and the Divine Phoenix Mountain’s side.

“Let’s forget about it. What Qu Wushuang said makes sense, so there’s no need to start a fight amongst ourselves for the Divine Blood Fruit now. The divine flame fragments are more important now,” Liu Yunlan said.

The Heavenly Kui Saint Lord also said, “Our focus should be on the divine flames now. Without Ji Zixi’s help, we won’t be able to break the last restriction.”

After those words were spoken, only the Ming Cult of the five holy lands remained.

Huang Jingyu’s face changed and became ugly before he gritted his teeth, “We’ll talk about this again once we leave this place. The Ming Cult won’t let this matter rest so easily!”

Lin Yun had no change on his face, but he found Huang Jingyu to be a clown. If it wasn’t for Su Ziyao’s reminder to not let the Blood Moon Sect obtain the divine flame fragments, Lin Yun would’ve made a move on the spot.

“Zixi, don’t be in a hurry to break the restriction. Can I take a look at it first?” Lin Yun asked, suppressing his murderous intent.

“I’ll accompany you,” Ji Zixi replied, nodding.

The two headed to the restriction together, with Qu Wushuang’s lips twitching when he saw this scene, but he quickly followed them.
