Chapter 1525 - There's A Need For A Dream (2)

Since Lin Yun’s obsession with a Divine Dragon Bone had practically become a demon in his heart, he would be consumed by the ferocity if he wasn’t careful. Simultaneously, a faint black demonic aura could be seen on his forehead.

If Lin Yun didn’t have the quasi-Heavenly Dome Sword Intent or the Azure Dragon Saint Physique, Lil’ Purple would definitely not let him fuse with the Blue Dragon Bone. But even so, the entire fusion process was dangerous, and it had reached a critical point now. Lin Yun could only try and overcome this whole ordeal by himself.

Half a day later, the blue light gradually faded, and the wound on Lin Yun’s chest was slowly being healed. All of the dragon runes were inside the Blue Dragon Bone and the ferocious aura that Lin Yun was releasing gradually dimmed.

When Lin Yun reopened his eyes, the black aura on his forehead was severed by several sword rays. With excitement flashing across her pupils, Lil’ Purple knew he had succeeded. She couldn’t contain her emotions at this moment.

As Lin Yun slowly descended, he suddenly lost control of his body and fell to the ground.

“Ouch!” Lin Yun yelled out in pain when he landed on the ground. He raised his head and saw a pearly white hand reaching over.

Lin Yun reached over with a smile, and Lil’ Purple pulled him back up. She muttered, “You’re as clumsy as a pig. I can’t drag you around anywhere.”

Her words made Lin Yun wear a mocking smile because he couldn’t muster any of his strength. Scratching his head, he swallowed a pellet and sat down. “I’ll briefly rest.”

After the time it took for half an incense to burn, Lin Yun opened his eyes and examined himself. When he clenched his fist, he could feel an ancient power surging from the Divine Dragon Bone. As purple-golden dragon runes flowed over the surface of his fist like water, it gave him the feeling that he could destroy a mountain with one punch.

“This…” Lin Yun smacked his lips with shock flashing through his pupils. This was a bizarre feeling. The purple-golden dragon runes would disappear and return to the Blue Dragon Bone after being used. It felt similar to astral energy. Like how cultivators had to refine astral energy, there was a scale. It was just like when his astral energy ocean reaching 35,000 feet; he couldn’t unleash the power that exceeded that.

The number of purple-golden dragon runes within the Blue Dragon Bone has reached 20,000. But the number wasn’t significant. The key lied in the fact that the Blue Dragon Bone could keep producing dragon runes. The Blue Dragon Bone could produce another one whenever he used a dragon rune.

This was the same as astral energy. In the past, it needed time to recover the dragon runes when they shattered. There might not seem to be much of a difference, but the difference was actually like heaven and earth.

Aside from that, Lin Yun could also sense that he was a lot stronger than before. Not only had his physique undergone a transformation, his astral energy would also contain the suppression of a blue dragon whenever he circulated the Blue Dragon Bone. This meant that he could fight enemies who had a cultivation higher than his own.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Simultaneously, his Azure Dragon Saint Art finally reached complete mastery, and there was no longer a flaw with his Azure Dragon Saint Physique.

Spreading his palm out, purple-golden dragon runes began to appear on his palm, and each dragon rune had a wisp of crimson engraved at the center of it. The dragon runes then began to combine..Initially, it wasn’t clear, but Lil’ Purple soon saw an azure dragon’s tail appearing within Lin Yun’s palm.

When the azure dragon’s tail appeared, the dragon runes merged together even faster. Soon, dragon scales, claws, bones; an entire dragon was slowly taking form. It didn’t take long for a 200-foot long azure dragon to be formed, filling the entire hall.

When the dragon's head fell onto Lin Yun’s right shoulder, the body of the azure dragon coiled around him. But that wasn’t all. Lin Yun then activated the Azure Dragon Saint Art.

A thunderstorm formed and a blue light surged. More dragon runes were being produced within the Blue Dragon Bone. Through this entire process, Lin Yun could sense that his vitality was swiftly being sapped away from him. So this didn’t mean that the dragon runes were endless.

He would need some time to recover when he runs out of vitality. This was the same logic as exhausting astral energy. But despite the restriction, the current him was ten times stronger than before.

When the Blue Dragon Bone produced another ten thousand dragon runes, Lin Yun formed a seal with his hands, and the dragon runes swiftly merged into an armor that enveloped him. The sight of this brought joy to him because there was no way he could summon the azure dragon and dragon armor at the same time in the past.

In the past, he could only choose between summoning the azure dragon or dragon armor. But now that he had the Blue Dragon Bone, he wouldn’t have to worry about that any longer.

Dismissing the azure dragon and dragon armor, Lin Yun tried to use the Azure Dragon Grasp. When his right hand reached out, Lin Yun instantly felt like he had summoned a vivid azure dragon claw.

This was bizarre because the azure dragon claw felt too real. It’s just that he was currently isolated from heaven because of the Blue Dragon Trial Tower, so he couldn’t really execute the Azure Dragon Grasp.

Since that was the case, he decided to try the thunderstorm vortex. With a single thought, dragon runes appeared within his palm that soon transformed into a terrifying vortex.

A powerful suction force exploded from his palm when the vortex appeared. The suction force was so powerful that it created cracks in the surrounding air. It was as if space would collapse in the next moment. This surprised him because he didn’t expect the vortex to tap into space.

His eyes shone brightly, and he could clearly feel that he had distorted the space, not the air. Although space and air might sound the same, they were completely different.

In the past, Lin Yun could compress and explode the air, but it had nothing to do with space. So even if the surrounding air had distorted, it would just take time for the air to recover. Furthermore, it had nothing to do with space, regardless of how terrifying it was.

But looking at the fluctuation and slight distortion in the air, Lin Yun could clearly sense that he had affected space, instead of air.

“The Azure Dragon Grasp is a little terrifying. It looks like the Azure Dragon Lord didn’t bluff you.” Lil’ Purple said. In the Azure Dragon Lord’s inheritance on the Heavenly Path, Lin Yun was shameless in asking for a small gift from the Azure Dragon Lord, and the Azure Dragon Grasp was that ‘small’ gift from the Azure Dragon Lord.

The Azure Dragon Lord taught it to him. But now that he looked at it again, the Azure Dragon Lord didn’t give him a ‘small’ gift.

Lin Yun nodded his head in agreement with Lil’ Purple’s words. When he was done testing the power of the Blue Dragon Bone, Lin Yun began to search around the hall.

“What are you looking for?” Lil’ Purple curiously asked.

“A divine art, obviously!” Lin Yun replied as he continued to search the hall. More accurately, he was looking for a body-refining technique belonging to the Blue Dragon’s lineage. After all, he couldn’t possibly keep using the Azure Dragon Saint Art with the Blue Dragon Bone.

Now that he had completely mastered the Azure Dragon Saint Art, he naturally focused on the body-refining technique of the Blue Dragon’s lineage.

Lil’ Purple instantly saw through his thoughts, and grumbled, “You’re really shameless. The Azure Dragon Saint Art is enough to last you to the Samsara Edict Realm and even the Saint Realm. So what if you found the body-refining technique of the Blue Dragon’s lineage? There’s no way you can cultivate it!”

Lin Yun retracted his attention when he heard that because he also realized he was too greedy.

“But…” Lil’ Purple rolled her eyes and winked, “There’s a need for a dream. What if you really found it?”

When Lin Yun looked at Lil’ Purple, he was briefly stunned before he smiled. It turned out that Lil’ Purple was also greedy.
