Chapter 2290 - Fight

Everyone from the Ming Cult was furious and couldn’t hold themselves back. Not only did Lin Yun kill Huang Jingyu and snatch his treasure, but he even used it in public with no concerns.

The Azure Glory Saint Sovereign lowered himself as a Saint Sovereign to launch a sneak attack on Lin Yun. Not only did Lin Yun manage to resolve it, but he even used Huang Jingyu’s treasure. This naturally made the Azure Glory Saint Sovereign furious and he no longer held back. The spatial cracks had become even more terrifying. “It looks like you must be tired of living!”

“It looks like you no longer want your face!” The Jade Lotus Saint Sovereign was also furious as she took a step forth to resist the pressure coming from the Azure Glory Saint Sovereign.

“Die!” The Azure Glory Saint Sovereign didn’t hide his murderous intent and pushed his palm forth with a revolving sun and moon, suppressing the Jade Lotus Saint Sovereign. In the path of his palm, the ground began to crack with explosive sunlight and moonlight.

A light pillar close to a thousand meters in radius exploded on the ground. This was the dragon spirit martial technique of the Ming Cult, the Sun-Moon Seal. Lin Yun had seen similar means from Huang Jingyu; however, the Azure Glory Saint Sovereign’s version was much stronger. When the seal descended, the surrounding space was destroyed.

“Glorious Divine Phoenix!” The Jade Lotus Saint Sovereign’s eyes shone as her hair began to flutter. With a gentle tap of her finger, light manifested into a divine phoenix that shattered the incoming seal. The attacks from the two Saint Sovereigns caused a huge commotion.

“The Divine Phoenix Mountain and Ming Cult are fighting!”

“Holy shit! How long has it been since holy lands fought one another in the Eastern Desolation?”

“The Ming Cult is domineering. They don’t even place the Divine Phoenix Mountain in their eyes since the Heavenly Dao Sect’s decline.”

“He wants to kill Lin Yun, which means that the rumors are true that Flower Burial saved everyone in the Flame Dragon Valley.”

“The Divine Phoenix Mountain might be strong, but they might not be able to protect Flower Burial with the three holy lands joining forces together.”

Everyone retreated as they watched, fearing being caught up in the clash between two Saint Sovereigns.

“Let’s go!”

“Kill them!”

“Since the Divine Phoenix Mountain dares to protect him, we do not need to speak with them. Let’s go!” The Flame Cry Saint Sovereign and Ghost Cleanse Saint Sovereign didn’t bother concealing themselves and they joined the fight. The three holy lands had joined forces to deal with Lin Yun. But in reality, they only needed an excuse to snatch the divine flame fragment from the Divine Phoenix Mountain.

The Jade Lotus Saint Sovereign sneered, “Why bother acting when you guys are obviously after the divine flame fragment? Do you think the Divine Phoenix Mountain is afraid of you guys?”

The Divine Phoenix Mountain came prepared for the divine flame fragment, and they knew they would be attacked by the three holy lands the moment they obtained it.

“Everyone from the Divine Phoenix Mountain, listen up! Kill them!” The Jade Lotus Saint Sovereign gave an order and all the Saints from the Divine Phoenix Mountain charged forth. “Astral River Saint Sovereign, time for you to undo the seal!”

Lin Yun could feel his blood boiling. He was a swordsman and naturally wouldn’t be afraid of a fight. But he maintained his composure and knew that the Jade Lotus Saint Sovereign wouldn’t be able to last long under the siege of three holy lands, so they needed the Astral River Saint Sovereign’s help.

The Blue Dragon Bone activated and vitality poured into the Astral River Saint Sovereign’s body when he pushed his palm forth.

“Saint energy?” The Astral River Saint Lord was shocked upon sensing the blue energy within his body. He only took a few moments before he recovered from his injuries.

Lin Yun could barely ensure that the Astral River Saint Lord was alive earlier. But the effect was different after his saint aura converted into saint energy.

After a brief shock, the Astral River Saint Sovereign laughed as he undid his seal, unleashing a terrifying saint aura. An additional Saint Sovereign alleviated the pressure that the Jade Lotus Saint Sovereign felt. Four holy lands fought with hundreds of Saint Lords clashing, creating a spectacular scene.

“Brat, let us see how you will run this time!” Three figures came. They were old acquaintances. They were the Heavenly Sage, Crow Shot, and Indigo Brave Saint Lords. These three Saint Lords once forced Lin Yun to jump down the Fallen God Valley, and Lin Yun killed Huang Jingyu when they met again. The three Saint Lords, especially the Heavenly Sage Saint Lord, were humiliated and released his murderous intent without reservations.

“Sun-Moon Seal!” The Heavenly Sage Saint Lord roared as his constellation opened behind him. The power of his palm caused the ground to collapse. He might not be as strong as the Azure Glory Saint Sovereign, but that didn’t mean he was weak.

“Thunder Chains!” The Crow Shot Saint Lord also attacked with his dao flower blooming behind him. Golden lightning formed into chains that descended from the sky, wanting to restrict Lin Yun’s movements, not giving him a chance to escape. At the same time, countless blade rays were flying over like a storm.

The three Saint Lords didn’t hold back the moment they attacked. Many people exclaimed when they saw Lin Yun being attacked and they became nervous.

“Good!” Lin Yun laughed as he faced the Heavenly Sage Saint Lord head-on with his palm. When the two palms collided, the Heavenly Sage Saint Lord threw out a mouthful of blood before he could respond and was sent flying away. This was shocking since Lin Yun was standing in the same spot without moving.

After the Heavenly Sage Saint Lord was sent flying away, Lin Yun pointed with his finger, creating a huge hole in the chest of Heavenly Sage Saint Lord. After landing on the ground, the Heavenly Sage Saint Lord threw out three mouthfuls of blood before stabilizing himself.

“Azure Dragon’s Grasp!” Lin Yun reached out with his dao flowers blooming and his dragon’s blood boiling. A dragon’s roar echoed and formed into a vortex with a thunderstorm. The suction force devoured all the chains of lightning into his palm.

“H-How is this possible?” The Crow Shot Saint Lord was shocked. But that wasn’t all. He soon noticed something wasn’t right. After the Azure Dragon’s Grasp devoured the chains, the suction force didn’t stop and pulled him over. It looked as though multiple azure dragons had pulled the Crow Shot Saint Lord over before he could respond.

“Come here!” Lin Yun reached out and grabbed onto the Crow Shot Saint Lord’s neck through the air.

“Let me go!” The Crow Shot Saint Lord struggled against Lin Yun’s five fingers, which were like dragon claws, grabbing onto the Crow Shot Saint Lord by his neck before throwing him away. Five holes were in his neck as the Crow Shot Saint Lord struggled on the ground like a dead fish.

At the same time, countless blade rays reached Lin Yun but the latter merely spread his arms apart, his Azure Saint Cloth fluttering in the wind. With a vibrating noise, the blade rays were all restricted by his sword intent and couldn’t move another inch forth.

“This…” The Indigo Brave Saint Lord raised his head, and his face froze when he looked at Lin Yun.

Lin Yun smiled as he shuttled through the blade rays and arrived before the Indigo Brave Saint Lord. He shattered the Indigo Brave Saint Lord’s dipper energy with his palm against the latter’s chest, sending the latter flying by a few thousand meters. The three Saint Lords were defeated in just one exchange, and this scene shocked everyone present.

“Die!” A roar broke the silence as a fifth-stage Saint Lord from the Ming Cult dashed over with a sun and a moon above him. When he performed a flying kick, all the space in the path of his kick shattered.

But Lin Yun didn’t panic. He executed the Divine Sunchasing Art and flew back.

“Do you think that you can escape?!” This Saint Elder was a fifth-stage Saint Lord as his daos had formed into a saint seal before he pushed his palm forth. When he attacked, the sun and moon above him revolved, allowing him to gain an advantage in the fight.

“If we don’t get rid of you, you’ll become a huge threat in the future!” The fifth-stage Saint Lord’s face was terrifyingly dark, seeing that the Indigo Brave Saint Lord was heavily injured, the Heavenly Sage Saint Lord dead, and the Crow Shot Saint Lord dying. He threw out eighteen palms, each seeming like a mountain that was descending from the sky.

Lin Yun didn’t face the attack head-on but circulated the two sword canons, accumulating the saint energy within his violent palace. The palms would land on the ground whenever he stepped back, causing the entire ground to violently tremble. When eighteen palms descended, they were like eighteen mountains that were blocking Lin Yun’s retreat path.

“Hmph!” Seeing his objective was achieved, the fifth-stage Saint Lord approached, wanting to kill Lin Yun. “Die!”

But Lin Yun had predicted his attack and raised his head, looking like a peerless sword even when eighteen palms were blocking his way and a fifth-stage Saint Lord attacking him.

“This is…?” Liu Yunlan’s heart throbbed as he sensed a terrifying aura coming from Lin Yun.

When a sword vibration echoed, boundless saint radiance swept from Lin Yun. Under the shock of everyone present, Lin Yun shone brightly with a pillar of light piercing through the clouds, looking like a blooming flower. The eighteen mountains shattered as he soared to the sky.

With a smile, Lin Yun looked arrogant as he laughed, “Who isn’t a Saint Lord now? Hahaha!”𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m
