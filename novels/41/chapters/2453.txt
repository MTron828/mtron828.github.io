Chapter 2454 - Myriad Sword Unite

The Radiant Sword Emperor’s words made everyone’s faces change, and they finally knew the objective of the Silver Dragon King. They were here to congratulate as a disguise, but their true objective was the dragon vein.

When the Radiant wanted to rush to the Divine Firmament Peak, the Silver Dragon King reached out to grab him. The Silver Dragon King said, “Stay behind!”

A powerful aura swept out from him, and his hand bloomed with silver radiance. A silver dragon’s claw appeared as the Silver Dragon King reached out.

“Go up!” Lin Yun’s face changed, but he knew he couldn’t interfere in a battle of this scale. He could only call everyone to the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron and retreated. This ensured that he wouldn’t drag his master down in the fight.

Before the aura swept over, Lin Yun and the Great Saints already stood on the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron. The cauldron was enveloped in a powerful pressure protecting everyone.

The Silver Dragon King was an Emperor second to mythical emperors, and everyone was worried for Radiant’s safety since he attacked suddenly. But the Radiant Sword Emperor was fearless as he took the palm head-on.

At the same time, a sword ray soared to the sky, piercing through the thirty-six layers of heaven, and retaliated with a palm. The Silver Dragon King took three steps back with a massive impact before stabilizing himself.

This surprised the Silver Dragon King because he hadn’t expected Radiant to be so strong when he had just reached the Emperor Realm, and this caught him by surprise. The Profound Imperial Palace’s two Emperor Realm elders fought with the Azure Dragon’s lineage and Divine Phoenix Mountain’s Emperors.

As for the Silver Dragon King, he was together with the three holy lands’ emperors as they sealed off Radiant’s path. The Silver Dragon King said, “Don’t treat him as someone who had just entered the Emperor Realm!”

This was the critical moment, and they couldn’t be bothered that they were ganging up on Radiant.

“What a formation!” Lin Yun took a deep breath with a grave expression.

Right then, a powerful impact sounded from the border of the Ancient Barren Domain, and everyone could sense how mighty the clash was. At the same time, a sword buzz and a dragon’s roar spread out, shattering the thirty-six layers of heaven.

Everyone could faintly see a white-clothed figure fighting a Golden-Purple Divine Dragon.

Lin Yun knew that Yu Qingfeng made a move and was sure the sword buzz came from the latter. But he had no joy because he could sense a faint deity’s aura from the Golden-Purple Divine Dragon.

“Quasi-Deity Realm!” The Divine Phoenix Holy Master said with a grave expression. Everyone else also wore a grave expression and could guess that Yu Qingfeng had made a move. But they didn’t expect that the Empress would have a cultivation in the Quasi-Deity Realm.

Taking a deep breath, Lin Yun said, “I believe in Yu Qingfeng!”

The Yu Qingfeng he saw beyond Kunlun Realm was someone who even dared to fight the Qilin Sword Immortal. So, how could he possibly fear a Quasi-Deity? If the Empress thinks she could suppress Yu Qingfeng with her cultivation in the Quasi-Deity Realm, she will suffer a loss.

In the Divine Firmament Peak, the Blade and Flame Emperors descended. But just when they wanted to make a move, the Black Emperor appeared as if he had already arrived.

“You betrayed the Empress. Luckily, Chen Yan made arrangements, or it will be troublesome if you join forces with the White Emperor.” The Blade Emperor didn’t seem surprised.

The Black Emperor sighed and knew that he couldn’t stop them.

“I’ll go in first. You two have a nice chat.” The Flame Emperor didn’t want to get involved and walked towards the Nether Palace.

The Black Emperor wanted to stop him, but he shook his head upon seeing the Blade Emperor staring at him, “There’s no meaning in this. Even if she managed to suppress the dragon vein here, she won’t be able to reach the Deity Realm.”

“We have to try to know if it’s meaningless or not. Nothing can be changed even if Yu Qingfeng made his move,” the Blade Emperor said.

“Let’s wait and watch then,” the Black Emperor smiled. The two stood in a stalemate and didn’t fight as they knew each other’s strength.

The Flame Emperor swiftly came to the Nether Palace and saw the Dustlight Great Saint guarding here. When Dustlight Great Saint saw the Flame Emperor, he despaired because he knew he couldn’t stop the latter.

He was only a Great Saint. He might be able to stand a chance against an ordinary Emperor, but he had no chance against the Flame Emperor.

“How long have you been here for?” The Flame Emperor smiled as he found a place to sit. He didn’t make a move.

The Dustlight Great Saint’s face changed, and he didn’t know how to answer that question.

“Don’t worry. I’m not here to kill anyone,” the Flame Emperor said.

“You’re here for the dragon vein. Make your move, then. I know I can’t stop you,” the Dustlight Great Saint said, sitting before the Flame Emperor.

“No hurry. Let’s wait,” the Flame Emperor said, shaking his head.

“Oh?” The Dustlight Great Saint was puzzled upon hearing that.

“I’m waiting for an outcome in the battle between Yu Qingfeng and the Empress,” the Flame Emperor smiled. He continued, “If the Empress wins, I will retrieve the Ancient Barren Dragon Vein. But if Yu Qingfeng won, I’m only here to chat with you.”

“What if it’s a draw?” The Dustlight Great Saint asked.

“If it’s a draw, I won’t retrieve the dragon vein and will leave the Dragon Suppression Monument to seal the dragon vein,” the Flame Emperor said.

“I heard that the Empress spent the past three thousand years refining nine Dragon Suppression Monuments. If you leave it here, the monument will still be used by her when she holds the ceremony,” the Dustlight Great Saint frowned.

“That’s right, but it’s different from taking it away. It can buy some time for the Sword Sect, for the Flower Burial,” the Flame Emperor nodded. He continued, “As long as he possesses the strength to defeat the Empress in the ceremony, he can protect the Ancient Barren Dragon Vein. At that time, the Sword Sect can even use the dragon vein.”

The Dustlight Great Saint couldn’t find a reason to refute that. He probed, “Have you really decided to do that?”

Based on the Flame Emperor’s strength, there was no need to waste time with them and could kill him easily. If he was more overbearing, the Flame Emperor could even use forbidden techniques to enslave him. But the Dustlight Great Saint was surprised that the Flame Emperor was so amicable with him.

The Flame Emperor nodded and said, “The world isn’t just black and white. I don’t like to take sides, and I don’t like to let anyone down. No matter what, I need your help. Otherwise, I can use my strength to break the seals, but it will cause huge damage to the Sword Sect and countless innocent lives.”

The Dustlight Great Saint’s face changed because what the Flame Emperor said was the truth. He asked, “Will you keep your promise?”

“I’m not a demonic cultivator and saved countless lives in the crisis three thousand years ago. I’m a righteous cultivator, and I won’t go back on my words,” the Flame Emperor smiled.

“Okay,” the Dustlight Great Saint agreed.

Seeing this, the Flame Emperor sighed, “I wouldn’t know what to do if you disagree, and you’ve helped me greatly.”

He took out the Flame God Wine he treasured and poured a cup for the Dustlight Great Saint.

The Dustlight Great Saint took a sip and could feel warmth throughout his body. The hidden injuries in his body were restored under the wine. He no longer hesitated and gulped it down before praising, “Good wine!”

“Can you tell me how long you have been guarding here?” The Flame Emperor smiled.

The Dustlight Great Saint sighed, “I don’t remember. In the past, this place was guarded by Emperors until my master died and I replaced him. At least two thousand years, I guess...”

“What a pity. In reality, no one will dare to go after the Ancient Barren Dragon Vein with Yu Qingfeng guarding it. If you knew, you wouldn’t have wasted two thousand years and might have a chance to reach the Emperor Realm,” the Flame Emperor said.

The Dustlight Great Saint wasn’t bothered, and he smiled, “But the Sword Sect still has to show our attitude.”

Unlike outside, the two were idly chatting like they were friends.

An hour later, the Flame Emperor said, “There’s an outcome.” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“How is it?” The Dustlight Great Saint asked nervously.

“Let me take a look.” The Flame Emperor closed his eyes and spread his senses to the border of the Ancient Barren Domain. He was surprised by the result because the radiance released by the Golden-Purple Divine Dragon became dim and couldn’t withstand its Quasi-Deity Realm’s aura.

Yu Qingfeng’s sword intent remained with blood dripping down his lips, but he wore a smile. The Empress suffered a loss, but Yu Qingfeng couldn’t defeat him.

The Flame Emperor opened his eyes and said, “Yan Chen failed to inflict heavy injuries on Yu Qingfeng in the Quasi-Deity Realm? This is unbelievable!”

“Yu Qingfeng won?” The Dustlight Great Saint rejoiced.

“A draw. Yan Chen is injured, but Yu Qingfeng wasn’t able to defeat her either,” the Flame Emperor muttered.

“I will keep to our agreement,” the Dustlight Great Saint said.

“That’s great,” the Flame Emperor nodded and cupped his fists together.

“With your strength, you don’t have to think about my view; this bow is unnecessary. Come with me,” the Dustlight Great Saint led the way according to their agreement and allowed the Flame Emperor to place the Dragon Suppression Monument down. This outcome was neither good nor bad.

With the Flame Emperor’s strength, the Dustlight Great Saint couldn’t stop him anyway.

There was also an outcome on the Scarlet Firmament Peak as the Emperors from the three holy lands had their chests pierced with a sword ray and fell onto one knee. Even their faces turned pale as well.

The three didn’t expect that the Radiant could inflict heavy injuries on them even when they were ganging up on him. Aside from the Silver Dragon King, who managed to block the Radiant’s attack, they couldn’t even get close to the Radiant.

This sword aura was too powerful as the Radiant caught up to Yu Qingfeng.

“Myriad Swords Unite!” The Radiant swung his sword as countless sword rays shattered the divine dragon behind the Silver Dragon King as ten thousand swords combined into a sword ray. The sword ray shattered the Silver Dragon King’s armor, covering the latter in blood.

The two elders from the Profound Imperial Palace also stopped as they quickly came over to support the Silver Dragon King.

“Hahaha! This sword has half of the power compared to mine back then!” When everyone was shocked by the Radiant Sword Emperor’s attack, Yu Qingfeng landed on the Scarlet Firmament Peak with a burst of laughter.

But before anyone could respond, the Empress descended on the Scarlet Firmament Peak. This made Su Ziyao nervous, with a hint of anxiety flashing across in her eyes. But Lin Yun said nothing and simply held onto Su Ziyao’s hand tightly.
