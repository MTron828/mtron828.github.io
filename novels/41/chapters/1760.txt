Chapter 1761 – Great Plans

Lin Yun and Yue Weiwei held hands and looked at each other on Dual Moon Lake. When the Three-Lives Flowers flew towards their location, a mysterious sensation rose in their hearts as their palms came into contact with one another. This was a bizarre feeling, and it felt like they were the only ones left on Dual Moon Lake.

A moment later, Lin Yun sat with many strange images playing in his mind, as if time was being reversed, and he saw many things.

He saw a woman who shared an uncanny resemblance with Yue Weiwei. When the scene flashed again, it turned to a picture of a baby, and a blurred middle-aged man stood beside the baby. He could sense how powerful the middle-aged man was, and he had a crimson aura around him. But when he looked at the baby, he wore a silly smile and gentle expression. As the scene flashed, the baby girl grew up quickly, and she was a younger version of Yue Weiwei.

When the scene became blurred, the next time he saw Yue Weiwei was an older version of her. But the scenes were extremely blurred, and he couldn’t distinguish them clearly. He could only sense a surge of sword intent accompanying her. Was that Yue Weiwei’s past, present, and future? The sword intent should be him, the baby should be Yue Weiwei, and the middle-aged man should be her father.

Yue Weiwei also saw a similar scene. She saw Lin Yun’s life flashing past her eyes. She saw a vague scene of a man lying in another man’s arms. When the man turned his head, his pupils were filled with boundless sadness, but the scene was too fast, moving towards the present before the future. She saw many scenes and had her eyes wide open in search of herself. A moment later, she was surprised to see herself with a child, but that scene flashed past too quickly. She began to wonder if that was her child with Lin Yun.

“Weiwei, what did you see?” Lin Yun asked.

When Yue Weiwei came to her senses, she blushed, “I won’t tell you. Big Brother Lin, what did you see?”

“I saw a sword beside you.” Lin Yun said truthfully.

“I don’t use a sword. So that must belong to you.” Yue Weiwei smiled.

Their hands were held even tighter as their past, present, and future flashed before their eyes. Right then, the Three-Lives Flowers that surrounded them entered their bodies. Both closed their eyes, and they became drowsy while falling into some sort of illusion.

This illusion was a test of love. It wasn’t only for Lin Yun but also Yue Weiwei. They will fail if they let go of each other’s hands in this test.

They both opened their eyes some time later, and a bizarre scenery appeared before them. A seed appeared in their palms that glowed and grew into a fruit. Compared to the Three-Lives Fruit that Lin Yun previously obtained, this Three-Lives Fruit was filled with even more spiritual energy and emitted a faint glow.

“The Three-Lives Fruit!” Yue Weiwei was excited as she raised her head to look at Lin Yun.

Lin Yun’s heart was billowing with waves despite wearing a composed expression.

“Lin Xiao really did it!”

“That fellow is really heaven-defying. It has been nearly a millennia since the Three-Lives Tree bloomed. Not only did it bloom this time, but it also bore a Three-Lives Fruit.”

“Unbelievable!” An uproar burst out from the surroundings, and everyone there looked at the two on Dual Moon Lake with envy. The women present all looked at Yue Weiwei with their pupils shining brightly.

They began to wonder how beautiful it would be if their lover confessed to them on Dual Moon Lake like Lin Yun and made the Three-Lives Tree bloom. Perhaps even a thousand years later, what happened today would be a legend.

On the ship, the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion’s pavilion master was so happy that the corner of his lips curled up.

“That brat has done a great job.” The pavilion master smiled, becoming even more fond of Lin Yun. It was as expected as an heir of their Azure Dragon’s lineage. He had yet to interact with Lin Yun, but he had already recognized Lin Yun’s status in his heart, regarding him as part of the Azure Dragon’s lineage.

“He actually made the Three-Lives Tree bear fruit.” Yan Tianchen smacked his lips, and his pupils were filled with admiration while looking at Lin Yun. When he turned to look at Yue Weiwei, a smile rose on his lips because his junior sister found a good belonging.

“It won’t be long before Lin Xiao’s name spreads throughout the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea.” Luo Shuyi smiled.

On the other side, those from the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion nodded lightly. Whether Lin Yun obtained first on the Nirvana Banquet, defeated Mei Zihua, and made the Three-Lives Tree bloom, they were all shocking events.

They could foresee that the name “Lin Xiao” would spread like wildfire, and he wouldn’t be as nameless as he was before.

“That fellow…” While everyone from the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion was excited, Chen Jun, Zhang Ying, and others wore ugly expressions.

“Not only did he defeat Mei Zihua, but he even made the Three-Lives Tree bear fruit.” A wisp of fear flashed across Chen Jun’s pupils, and he now knew how strong Lin Yun was. When Lin Yun previously fought with Li Yuxi, he probably didn’t even use his full strength.

Just where did a guy like him come from?

The Nirvana Banquet finally ended, but Lin Yun wasn’t done with his matters yet. Together with Yue Weiwei, they flew towards the ship hovering in the sky. When he swept his gaze over the ship, he could sense countless respectful gazes directed at him. His gaze then fell onto the pavilion master.

Cupping his hands as a form of greeting, Lin Yun asked, “Pavilion Master, when can we discuss our matters?”

“Anytime you want.” The pavilion master smiled.

Nodding his head, Lin Yun heaved a sigh of relief from the pavilion master’s friendly attitude. This gave him more confidence in the Azure Dragon’s Lineage affairs. If he could accomplish his goal, it meant that he didn’t spend the past six months practicing music dao for naught.

He was powerless against Tian Xuanzi, but it would be a strong boost if he could receive the help of the Azure Dragon’s lineage.

Tian Xuanzi was a top-tiered powerhouse to begin with. He also had connections with the Divine Dragon Empire, which made Lin Yun despair for a long time. But he finally saw a glimmer of hope today.

When Lin Yun and Yue Weiwei exchanged a glance, they both revealed a smile.

With the Nirvana Banquet ending, the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion soon became empty, and all the musicians were satisfied with this Nirvana Banquet. Not to mention that they witnessed history at the end of it.

Everyone could foresee that the name ‘Lin Xiao’ would spread like wildfire with their departure. The young man who defeated Mei Zihua and made the Three-Lives Tree bloom would become famous within the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea.

But Lin Yun had no interest in fame and was even afraid of it. After all, he was Lin Xiao and would be in greater danger with a greater reputation. He wouldn't want that fame if he had a choice.

On the second day after he obtained the Three-Lives Fruit, Lin Yun was brought to meet an elder from the Divine Phoenix Mountain under Liu Ruochen.

“Haha. I’m Ji Hongxin, the lord of the eighth peak of the outer sect.” This elder politely introduced himself upon seeing Lin Yun’s arrival.

Lin Yun instantly knew that Liu Ruochen should be an outer disciple. But he didn’t look down on them because of it, and said in a deep voice, “I heard from Brother Liu that the Divine Phoenix Mountain is interested in the Divine Phoenix Touch?”

“Since Young Master Lin is so polite, I won’t play any tricks, then. What do you want? Not only the Divine Phoenix Touch, but we’re also interested in the Phoenix Heart Song.” Ji Hongxin went straight into the topic without beating around the bush.

But Lin Yun had no change in his expression and replied, “There’s no need to hurry. For now, I can only give you either the Divine Phoenix Touch or Phoenix Heart Song.”

Liu Ruochen and Ji Hongxin exchanged a glance with doubt within their pupils. They had no idea what Lin Yun meant, so Ji Hongxin tentatively asked, “Young Master Lin, what do you want? I might be a peak lord of the outer sect, but I can still decide on many things.”

“That’s not the reason. The Divine Phoenix Mountain has nine palaces and eight peaks. Even a peak lord is an existence that I can only look up to, and they’re far beyond my reach. The peak master can pick one of them first.” Lin Yun replied.

Although Ji Hongxin was still baffled, he was flattered by Lin Yun’s attitude. He was humble because the surname ‘Ji’ had an unimaginable influence on Divine Phoenix Mountain.

“Ruochen, you choose.” Ji Hongxin turned to look at Liu Ruochen.

Liu Ruochen was taken aback for a moment before he smiled, “If I had to choose, it would definitely be the Phoenix Heart Song. But Brother Lin, are you sure about giving it to us here?”

Lin Yun didn’t say anything but handed a jade slip over. When Liu Ruochen took the jade slip, he had doubt on his face. But after checking the contents of the jade slip, his face gradually changed, and he was speechless for a long time. Liu Ruochen still couldn’t believe what he saw, and stuttered, “B-Brother Lin, you…”

“What is it?” Ji Hongxin took over the jade slip, and his face drastically changed after a while. The jade slip contained the complete score of the Phoenix Heart Song. When Ji Hongxin raised his head to look at Lin Yun again, he had the same disbelief on his face as Liu Ruochen.

They initially thought Lin Yun would only give them half or one-third of the score, but they didn’t expect Lin Yun to give it so straightforwardly. The Phoenix Heart Song was a powerful secret technique for ordinary people. But it had a significant meaning to the Divine Phoenix Mountain, and the value was priceless.

“You have won my admiration.” Ji Hongxin said, and his expression became a little grave. He no longer asked what Lin Yun wanted, and stood up with a smile. “I roughly know what you want. We’ll meet again in the future.”

“We will.” Lin Yun smiled.

When Ji Hongxin and Liu Ruochen walked out, the latter asked, “Peak Lord, what does Lin Yun want?”Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“I don’t know, but I know that it’s not something I can give.” Ji Hongxin said.

“What does he mean, then?” Liu Ruochen asked.

“By letting us choose between the Divine Phoenix Touch and Phoenix Heart Song, he’s telling us that this is only a meeting gift for us and represents his sincerity. I’m afraid that only the saint lord can decide what he wants…” Ji Hongxin smiled.

Liu Ruochen was shocked because Lin Yun was too generous. He asked, “But what if the saint lord doesn’t meet him? Doesn’t that mean he’s at a loss?”

“This is the reason why he won my admiration. He’s confident that the saint lord will meet him after obtaining the Phoenix Heart Song. He believes no one at Divine Phoenix Mountain understands the Phoenix Heart Song better than him.” Ji Hongxin sighed softly.

Finally figuring it all out, Liu Ruochen asked, “So, we’ll have to ask him for a favor in the end?”

“Not necessarily. The Divine Phoenix Mountain is one of the Eastern Desolation’s six holy lands. Even if the saint lord meets him, we can’t let Lin Yun look down on us.” Ji Hongxin said pridefully.

Mu Xueling quietly walked out after Liu Ruochen and Ji Hongxin left. Lin Yun was cautious, and he wouldn’t put himself in a dangerous position even if he trusted the other party. So he naturally prepared a backup plan in case something happened.

If they tried to force it out of him, they wouldn’t succeed with Mu Xueling around. Ji Hongxin’s speculation was right. The Divine Phoenix Touch and Phoenix Heart Song were just appetizers. Who else understood the Phoenix inheritance better than Lil’ Purple? She was old enough to be their ancestor, under the condition that she was willing.

“I’ll have to trouble Saint Elder to come with me now.” Lin Yun said, looking at Mu Xueling.

The Divine Phoenix Mountain was a surprise, and he gave them an act of expressing goodwill, even if things wouldn’t work out. But it was a different story for the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion.

“It’s not troublesome at all, and I’m also fairly curious about the Azure Dragon’s lineage.” Mu Xueling said. She was basking in a faint saint radiance that made her look like a cold deity.
