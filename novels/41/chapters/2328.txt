Chapter 2329 - Lin Jiangxian's Stength

Lin Jiangxian was a decisive person who charged at the Emerald Demonic Ape after asking Ji Zixi. But the Emerald Demonic Ape was a primordial beast who suffered heavy injuries, unleashing its full potential in a desperate strait.

With a wave of her hand, Lin Jiangxian released a sword ray, shattering all the incoming attacks. When the Heavenly Sword Pavilion’s disciples came, they realized they couldn’t join the battle.

But Lin Jiangxian wasn’t a pushover. She gave off a terrifying sword aura despite the vast difference in size between her and the Emerald Demonic Ape. Under the demonic clouds, Lin Jiangxian released a dazzling sword ray that left behind cracks in the surrounding space. She was like a flawless jade that no space could tear apart.

“What a powerful sword intent!” Lin Yun was surprised when he saw this scene. Lin Jiangxian didn’t possess a divine physique, but she could still withstand the tear of space. After a few exchanges, the Emerald Demonic Ape became even more disadvantageous.

Seeing that the Emerald Demonic Ape wanted to go all out, Lin Jiangxian let out a roar with a golden radiance shining from her pupils, unleashing her Quasi-Divine Light Sword Intent that formed into a descending colossal sword.

The sword ray flashed and the Emerald Demonic Ape was severed into two under Lin Jiangxian’s sword. When the corpse split apart, a golden fortune appeared with a saint origin and a near-perfect beast core. The beast core shone brightly like stars, giving off a powerful pressure.

The radiance from the beast core illuminated the heavens and earth as thunderclouds began to gather with descending lightning. Lin Jiangxian sheathed her sword and summoned the beast core, saint origin, and golden fortune with a wave of her hand.

“Golden fortune!”

“It’s a golden fortune!” Everyone from the Heavenly Sword Pavilion was excited as they began to harvest the Emerald Demonic Ape’s corpse. Wu Yuhua found an eyeball with an ancient rune within. With just a glance, anyone could tell that it was precious.

Everyone gathered beside Lin Jiangxian and looked excited by their harvest. When Lin Jiangxian saw Lin Yun and Ji Zixi coming over, she sent the golden fortune to Ji Zixi. This stunned Ji Zixi, since she hadn’t encountered this situation before. After a brief hesitation, Ji Zixi accepted it, “Thank you, Big Sister.”

Xi Ruo was furious when she saw this, and said, “Why give a golden fortune to an outsider? She’s an ugly girl who doesn’t even dare to reveal…”

But just when she wanted to continue, she suddenly felt a chill and saw Lin Yun’s cold gaze when she raised her head. This made her panic, and she swallowed her remaining words.

Lin Jiangxian said, “I’m just taking care of a friend from the Kunlun Realm, and she’s more suitable than you.”

Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts and wondered if Lin Jiangxian noticed something. Hearing what Lin Jiangxian said, Xi Ruo’s face became pale, and she had no choice but to suck it up.

“Trouble has come,” Lin Jiangxian said.

Three figures descended from the sky. They were surprised when they saw the corpse of the Emerald Demonic Ape before they became furious. Hovering in the sky were Bai Yu, Xiong Tiannan, and a white-clothed youth whom Lin Yun never met before. But since this person could come with Bai Yu and Xiong Tiannan, this person must be a genius on the Brandished Dragon Ranking.

Xiong Tiannan and the white-clothed youth aside, Bai Yu was already troublesome to deal with. He was one of the four sect’s chiefs and had been extremely brutal ever since he came to the Heavenly Barren Realm. A few days ago, everyone saw how brutal he could be.

The three had injuries on them, but they weren't heavily injured. Anyone could tell that they were chasing after the Emerald Demonic Ape with a glance.

Xiong Tiannan was fine when he saw Lin Jiangxian, but his face changed upon seeing Lin Yun. When he exchanged a gaze with Lin Yun, he immediately cowered when he saw the playful smile on Lin Yun’s face.

“I have something else to do, so I’ll take my leave.” Xiong Tiannan didn’t dare to stick around, surprising the white-clothed youth and Bai Yu beside him.

Bai Yu wasn’t bothered but coldly said, “Lin Jiangxian, it looks like you’ve gotten bolder to snatch something that belongs to me, but you can be considered my junior in the Azure Cloud Realm.”

The two might seem young, but Lin Jiangxian was much younger than Bai Yu. But she couldn’t be considered his junior. Bai Yu just wanted to suppress Lin Jiangxian with his seniority. He continued, “Hand over the beast core and saint origin if you’re smart. Otherwise… I’m afraid that you won’t be able to see the Sovereign Monument.”

Lin Jiangxian smiled, “Since I’ve made a move, I have no intention of handing them over. Come snatch them if you have the guts, and see if my sword is sharp.”

Her strong response made everyone from the Heavenly Sword Pavilion excited.

“A woman dares to be so arrogant before me? It looks like you’re tired of living!” Bai Yu became furious, and a fan appeared in his hand. When the fan opened up, a crimson baleful aura enveloped a hundred miles in radius. It was like a purgatory with him as the master.

Lin Yun squinted. This was similar to his Sword Domain. He instantly discovered that there were no weaklings on the Brandished Dragon Ranking.

“You can’t scare me.” Lin Jiangxian waved her hand and retrieved her sword, facing the fan head-on. The sword ray scattered, creating a colossal collision, while making holes in the crimson domain. They were evenly matched in this attack with both of them taking a few steps back.

Bai Yu was surprised and stared at Lin Jiangxian. He noticed that her eyes were shining brightly with a somewhat complete golden rune in her eyes. She wasn’t at the Quasi-Divine Light Sword Intent but the actual Divine Light Sword Intent, and she even reached lesser mastery in it.

“Bai Yu, I won’t compete with you. You can have it.” The white-clothed youth wore a cunning smile and left. He had already noticed that Lin Jiangxian had grasped the Divine Light Sword Intent, not Quasi-Divine Light Sword Intent. So, even if he and Bai Yu managed to defeat Lin Jiangxian, they wouldn’t be able to gain any benefits. He was intelligent, and didn’t want to put himself in that situation before the Sovereign Monument since he wanted to compete for the Dao Fruit.

Bai Yu inwardly cursed and coldly said, “Don’t think you’re invincible just because you've grasped the Divine Light Sword Intent. I have plenty of ways to deal with you.”

His golden pill bloomed with murderous intent sweeping out. He also summoned his constellation and a bone armor clad on him.

But Lin Jiangxian wasn’t afraid since she had her Divine Light Sword Intent. She soared to the sky and they exchanged over a dozen moves, shocking Ji Zixi from afar. This was the first time she saw a swordsman capable of being compared to Lin Yun when he was in the Heavenly Void. The only thing she lacked was dominance.

She still couldn’t forget when Lin Yun stood on the Flame Dragon’s skull with three thousand ribbons behind him. But compared to the crimson bone armor, Lin Jiangxian looked tiny and focused on defending.

“It doesn’t seem optimistic,” Ji Zixi said despite Lin Jiangxian holding the advantage in the fight on the surface.

Lin Yun said, “She has been holding back. She’s waiting for an opportunity, since she only has one. But Bai Yu also knows this, so he’s trying to inflict heavy injuries on Lin Jiangxian before then.”

Ji Zixi’s eyes lit up, and she said, “But why not like you?”

Lin Yun smiled, “I was also like that in the past.”

In the past, he had to kill his opponent through a desperate strait and nearly died a few times. The countless experiences with life and death transformed him, allowing him to gain comprehension after the fight. That might seem insignificant, but it all exploded after he became a Saint.

Lin Yun’s sword mastery had reached an unimaginable height, with his sword technique becoming profound. Without him knowing it, he already had the style of a grandmaster.

After ten-odd moves, the opportunity Lin Yun spoke of finally arrived, and it was futile for Bai Yu even if he was on his guard. As a sword ray flashed, twelve giant swords descended from the sky and shattered Bai Yu’s crimson bone armor.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

As Bai Yu retreated, the other cultivators from the Blood Bone Gate also rushed over.

Lin Jiangxian sheathed her sword with disciples of the Heavenly Sword Pavilion gathered behind her. She said, “Bai Yu, do you still have any opinions about what I do?”

Bai Yu was furious, but he knew that it was futile to carry on fighting, and it was impossible to retrieve the Emerald Demonic Ape’s beast core and saint origin. He could do nothing about this but suck it up and leave with the disciples of the Blood Bone Gate. “This isn’t the end!”

Everyone from the Heavenly Sword Pavilion rejoiced with excitement on their faces.

“The chief grasped the Divine Light Sword Intent in lesser mastery!”

“Who will dare to compete with the Heavenly Sword Pavilion before the Sovereign Monument?!” Cheers echoed as Lin Jiangxian came over to Lin Yun and Ji Zixi, and Ji Zixi congratulated her.

Ji Zixi smiled, “Big Sister Lin, you’re really powerful.”

Lin Jiangxian nodded, then looked at Lin Yun, “Compared to that, I’m more curious as to why Xiong Tiannan left after seeing you.”

If Xiong Tiannan didn’t leave, the white-clothed youth wouldn’t have left, either. At that time, she wouldn’t stand a chance, even with the Divine Light Sword Intent.

“Did he? I guess it’s a coincidence,” Lin Yun smiled.

“I’m afraid that it’s not,” Lin Jiangxian said but didn’t go deeper into it. The Heavenly Sword Pavilion’s disciples were bothered by what Lin Jiangxian said.

Only Wu Yuhua scratched his head and wondered if it was really Xiong Tiannan who saved him. Could it be that it was Lin Yun who saved him instead?!

Thinking about this, Wu Yuhua was shocked as he looked at the smiling Lin Yun. But he couldn’t convince himself with that, which left him confused.
