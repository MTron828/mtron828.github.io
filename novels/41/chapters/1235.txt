Chapter 1236 - Jian Jingtian!

Lin Yun now knew why the elders were all gritting their teeth when he walked out of the domain. If he was in their position, he definitely couldn’t bear it. Even if he was stupid, Lin Yun knew the consequences if the Divine Dragon Pagoda collapsed.

Most importantly, he had devoured 72 divine dragon auras. This meant that the deacons and elders wouldn’t be able to enjoy the divine dragon aura any time soon. Lin Yun scratched his head awkwardly because he knew that he was in the wrong.

He pondered if he should return some divine dragon aura. After all, he hadn’t completely refined them, and he could still return a few wisps if he turned back now.

But just when Lin Yun was about to tell Ye Ziling about his thoughts, Ye Ziling glanced at him and said, “Don’t think about it. Luo Hua took the responsibility for you.”

“Luo Hua?” Lin Yun was briefly stunned before he instantly figured it all out. This was also probably the reason why he was allowed to leave after absorbing all of the divine dragon aura. Luo Hua had helped him again, just like how she helped him back in the Sword Assembly. This made Lin Yun wonder what she and Yan Tie went to do. He knew that she had a strong personality, and she probably had killing intent toward those Dragon Pulse Realm experts.

At the same time, Lin Yun realized that he still wasn’t strong enough, and he couldn’t possibly let her help him all the time. After all, he couldn’t accept himself standing behind a woman as a man because it would make him seem too useless.

“Junior Brother Lin, you didn’t know that the Divine Dragon Pagoda nearly collapsed. All of us were dumbfounded, and the prefectural lord nearly went down on his knees. But Luo Hua was calm and retrieved a medal. When she took out the token, the Divine Dragon Pagoda that was about to collapse suddenly became firm,” said Liu Qingyan emotionally.

Lin Yun looked at Jiang Lichen and Feng Zhang. The two were still lingering with fear because what just happened had left a deep impression on them.

“What medal was it?” Lin Yun asked.

“I didn’t see it clearly. I was terrified at that time, but Senior Sister saw it,” said Feng Zhang. They were completely dumbfounded back then and didn’t manage to take a clear glimpse of the medal.

Only Ye Ziling maintained her composure, but her face changed when she saw the medal. Hearing what Feng Zhang said, Ye Ziling glared at the latter, scaring the latter to shut his mouth. When she saw Lin Yun’s gaze, Ye Ziling said, “I only saw an ‘Imperial’ word on it. She’s definitely not someone from the Luo Clan. There’s no way the Luo Clan can take out that medal.”

Lin Yun nodded his head and began to look around before he asked, “Where is she?”

“She asked us to return to the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect first and said there’s no need to wait for her,” said Feng Zhang.

“The Divine Dragon Pagoda exhausted too much origin dragon aura, and she has to stay behind to clean up the mess,” said Jiang Lichen.

Hearing that, Lin Yun knew that he had owed her greatly. Taking a deep breath, Lin Yun fell silent. Everyone fell silent as Ye Ziling and Wang Yuruo’s gazes fell onto Lin Yun. Even if they were stupid, they could tell that there was a story behind Lin Yun and Luo Hua.

Perhaps they already knew each other a long time ago. Otherwise, it would make no sense that a woman like her would help a stranger so much.

A long time later, Lin Yun raised his head and smiled, “Let’s go.”

But just when they were about to leave, Lin Yun turned back and bit his lips with perseverance flashing in his eyes. He recalled his promise back in the Profound Amber Realm that one fine day, he would stand at the summit of Kunlun Realm and wouldn’t be any weaker than any monstrous geniuses.

Five days later, the party finally returned to the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. The result of the ranking battle had already reached the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, so they were welcomed by a majestic group of people. When Lin Yun appeared, the surrounding cheers became even louder.

He was now a famous figure in the Profound Azure Prefecture after helping the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s fame grow even higher. Lin Yun had experienced a similar scene before back in the Firmament Sword Sect.

“I’m going to see the sect master. Are you coming with me?” Lin Yun asked since he had to return the Lightning Shadow Sword.

“It’s fine.” Ye Ziling smiled with a complicated light flashing through her pupils.

Lin Yun could tell that there was some desolation in her smile. She probably guessed where he went before the tournament. It also meant that in the eyes of her father, the ranking battle was nothing to him.

Knowing that the relationship between the father and daughter was complicated, Lin Yun merely nodded his head.

“Lin Yun, thank you.” Ye Ziling suddenly called out to Lin Yun just before he was about to leave.

“Me? I’m fine. After all, I like you as well, but not like that…” Lin Yun winked.

“That fellow is really interesting.” Looking at Lin Yun’s back figure, Ye Ziling couldn’t help smiling with the frost on her face melting. This scene instantly made all the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s disciples dumbfounded.

“Hehe. Go and chase after him if you’re also interested in him. Don’t tell me that you don’t have the confidence to beat Luo Hua?” Wang Yuruo smiled.

Hearing that, Ye Ziling pinched her nose and smiled, “You’re becoming more and more naughty. It’s not like that. I admit that he’s really tempting, but there are some people you won’t forget the moment you see them.”

Both Flower Burial and Lin Yun were important people to her. But after this incident, she was finally sure that her heart belonged to Flower Burial. The moment someone like her becomes attracted to someone, it would be impossible for her to change.

After all, her frozen heart wavered the first time she saw Flower Burial. It was like a hook stabbing into her heart that she couldn’t pull out.

As for Lin Yun, they were friends that watched each other’s backs. If Lin Yun was facing difficulty, Ye Ziling was even willing to put her life on the line for him.

In the main hall, the sect master held onto the Lightning Shadow Sword and smiled. He didn’t bother concealing the happiness on his face.

“Old geezer, isn’t your smile a little too wretched?” Lin Yun rolled his eyes. This fellow nearly made him lose his life in the three challenges. When he came over, the old geezer didn’t say a word and kept smiling at the Lightning Shadow Sword.

Initially, Lin Yun wasn’t going to hold it against the old geezer. But seeing this scene, his temper started to flare up.

“As long as I’m happy.” But the sect master didn’t care about him and said, “You’re really a genius in the sword. I never expected that even the old geezer of the Skysolute City would suffer in your hand. Hahaha! How satisfying!”

When he mentioned the Skysolute City, he couldn’t help bursting into laughter. He then turned to look at Lin Yun’s forehead and stroked his beard, “Looks like you already know why I asked you to participate in the Sword Assembly.”

Back then, Lin Yun was angry at him. But since he was willing to deliver the sword to him and even stayed behind, Lin Yun clearly understood what happened. Although Lin Yun had a foul temper, he still knew how to differentiate right and wrong.

“What are you talking about?” Lin Yun feigned ignorance and turned his head away.

“It’s good if you know about it. Take the sword. I’m already satisfied that I can see the sword again. Take good care of it on my behalf. It was given to me by a really powerful expert, and I know that you won’t let it down in your hands.” The old geezer handed the sword back to Lin Yun. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

When Lin Yun received the sword, his face became grave. It looks like the Huang Clan’s patriarch was right. The old geezer had already let go of the Lightning Shadow Sword, and he didn’t really need it when he asked Lin Yun to retrieve it. His sole objective was to allow Lin Yun to take another step with his quasi-divine firmament sword intent.

“Wang Jue isn’t your name. Your real name is Jian Jingtian, ranked first on the Empyrean, Elysium Core, and Dragon Pulse Rankings. Even now, you’re still ranked one on the Dragon Pulse Ranking! No experts in the Dragon Pulse Realm dare to make a move against you,” said Lin Yun as he received the Lightning Shadow Sword. The achievements of the old geezer were legendary.

“That isn’t important.” Jian Jingtian was calm when Lin Yun talked about him. Just like how he had already let go of the Lightning Shadow Sword, he had also let go of his past glory a long time ago.

“I’m really curious how strong your sword intent is! Let me experience it as a swordsman!” Lin Yun said. When he was done, the sword cocoon in his forehead shined and its golden aura burst into flames.

As his sword aura exploded, Jian Jingtian smiled in surprise. At this moment, the monstrous genius who was ranked first on the three rankings was back. With a faint smile, he said, “Looks like you’re a little too overconfident in yourself after crushing the Sword Assembly and the ranking battle…”

When he was done, the scenes before Lin Yun suddenly changed. The old geezer and the main hall had disappeared, replaced with a boundless ocean with a dazzling fireball hovering in the air. The light radiating from the fireball was dazzling and Lin Yun’s sword aura instantly collapsed under the terrifying aura.

Feeling threatened, the Azure Dragon Saint Art activated by itself and the Blood Flame Dragon Rune began to blaze in the Azure Dragon Mark with 300 dragon runes shining brightly. In the blink of an eye, the dragon runes formed battle armor over his body.

But the moment the armor was formed, it instantly shattered. One by one, the dragon runes began to shatter until the crimson flames in the Azure Dragon Mark were extinguished.

This made Lin Yun throw up a mouthful of blood as he held onto his eyes that were dripping with blood.

“You’re nothing before me.” Jian Jingtian’s prideful voice sounded out. “As you requested, that was my strongest sword intent. I showed it to you out of respect for you as a swordsman. You can be proud that you weren’t instantly killed.”

Lin Yun was embarrassed, and he knew that Jian Jingtian definitely held back.

“Get lost now. Furthermore, there are some changes in the Profound Wither Island, so you are to stay in the sect no matter what,” said Jian Jingtian while waving his hand.

In the end, Lin Yun could only leave quietly with the Lightning Shadow Sword. He had finally experienced the strength of a monstrous genius who was the first on all three rankings.
