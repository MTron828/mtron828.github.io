Chapter 862 - Bloodflame Pupil!

Lin Yun naturally had no idea that his test had been orchestrated by fate. If he won, the Ancient Southern Domain would rise, resolving the karma of the Sword Sect. But if Lin Yun failed, the Ancient Southern Domain’s rise would be disrupted.

The focus of this battle was no longer a simple test. Enveloped in starlight, Yan Mo looked at Lin Yun coldly, “I still have some expectation for this battle. After all, Yu Haotian isn’t a pushover. I hope that your spiritual sword intent won’t disappoint me.”

After he finished speaking, Yan Mo took a step forward and his aura exploded like a volcanic eruption. The hall began to tremble from his terrifying killing intent. But what shocked the spectators even more was Yan Mo’s martial intent, massacre intent.

Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with surprise because massacre intent wasn’t easy to comprehend. In the entire Ancient Southern Domain, only Wu Xiaotian managed to grasp it. But there was naturally no way Wu Xiaotian’s massacre intent could compete with Yan Mo.

Enveloped in crimson radiance, thousands of ghastly howls echoed out. Yan Mo was truly worthy of being the Gauze Eastern Domain’s champion. But since he came from a domain riddled with demonic cultivators, it made sense that he managed to cultivate the massacre intent to such a terrifying stage.

But Yan Mo wasn’t done. Suddenly, a sword hum echoed from Yan Mo’s body as he successfully combined the massacre intent with the sword intent.

“Lin Yun, this is my massacre sword intent!” laughed Yan Mo. At this moment, Yan Mo had manifested a crimson gale. Wielding his sword, Yan Mo stabbed his sword at Lin Yun’s chest. Based on Yan Mo’s aura, he could easily kill a quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm without even stabbing them.

“You aren’t impressive afterall.” Lin Yun didn’t even react to Yan Mo’s strength as he summoned the Flower Burial Sword to his hand. Sparks flew around the hall as the swords clashed. Lin Yun poured his boundless origin energy into his attack with the Immortal Azure Dragon Sword Aura. The massacre sword intent was terrifying, but it wasn’t hard for him to deal with.

“Spiritual sword intent!” Yan Mo’s eyes flashed because Lin Yun had exceeded his expectations. Logically speaking, his massacre sword intent should be on par with spiritual sword intent. However, his attack was actually stopped, which proved that Lin Yun truly had some means.

“Try this!” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly as he combined his spiritual sword intent with the Immortal Azure Dragon Sword Aura. With a domineering aura, Lin Yun swung out his sword. This caught Yan Mo by surprise as he suffered a great loss. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Overlord Sword—Thunderbolt Slash!” Before Yan Mo could react, Lin Yun flicked his wrist and eighteen thunderbolts combined into one.

As Yan Mo snorted coldly, crimson light exploded behind him. His massacre sword intent manifested into a crimson dragon to destroy Lin Yun’s attack.

“Solar Slash, Big Bang, Breaking Dawn, Tai’a Slash!” But just when Yan Mo destroyed Lin Yun’s attack, Lin Yun unleashed four other forms of the Overlord Sword in a single breath. At this moment, Lin Yun had pushed his Overlord Sword to the limit, creating various phenomena in the surroundings.

This was the first time Yan Mo had encountered such a troublesome opponent. With a cold light flashing through his eyes, he poured his origin energy into the crimson dragon behind him.

“Ocean Breaking Crimson Sword!” Yan Mo’s sword released a crimson radiance, destroying all of Lin Yun’s phenomena. The cold light from Yan Mo’s sword was terrifying, especially since it was empowered by his massacred sword intent.

Yan Mo’s crimson sword ray destroyed Lin Yun’s attacks without losing power. In an instant, the sword ray shot towards Lin Yun’s head.

Cloudsoaring Art!

Lin Yun stomped his foot in mid-air, which unleashed a fluctuation into the surroundings. Then, Lin Yun spun in mid-air and prepared his next attack. Lin Yun gathered the dissipated phenomena and merged them into a sword ray.

“Supreme Dominance!” Lin Yun held onto his sword and merged seven forms of the Overlord Sword together. The boundless sword ray easily destroyed Yan Mo’s attack before it had a chance to reveal its ferocity.

Facing Lin Yun’s attack, Yan Mo’s face finally changed because he didn’t think that Lin Yun’s sword technique would be so powerful. When Lin Yun’s sword reached him, his clothes began to flutter as he was pushed several steps backwards. Brandishing his sword, Yan Mo tried his best to cancel out Lin Yun’s attack. After taking ten steps back, a boundless sword aura surged out from his body that destroyed the remaining power of Supreme Dominance.

Then, Lin Yun and Yan Mo clashed again, exchanging dozens of moves in the blink of an eye. In the beginning, Yan Mo was able to rely on his massacre sword intent to fight Lin Yun evenly. But as time passed, he gradually fell into a disadvantageous position. Lin Yun’s sword intent was perfect and flawless, not to mention that it was merged with wind intent, lightning intent, azure dragon aura, and immortal intent. With another clash, Yan Mo was sent flying as he slid on the ground briefly before he managed to stabilize himself.

“Is that all you got?” Lin Yun sneered, “Champion of Gauze Eastern Domain, bring out your real trump card. Your current self is nothing to me.”

Lin Yun knew that Yan Mo was strong. At the very least, Yan Mo was stronger than Zhong Xuan. However, before Lin Yun’s spiritual sword intent, Yan Mo couldn’t gain an advantage.

“You really are a sword path genius. I can’t believe that you’re only eighteen. But that’s all you are.” Yan Mo smiled and the cold light in his eyes grew even colder. Suddenly, a crimson radiance shot out from his sword, which manifested into a dragon that flew towards Lin Yun.

All of this happened in a split second and an ordinary genius would fall to it. Although Lin Yun had no idea what Yan Mo was trying to do, he kept himself on high alert, so he was able to react in time. The crimson sword appeared half a meter before him and was stopped by an invisible sword aura.

A thirty meter long azure dragon appeared behind him with lightning crackling on its scales, wind shrouding its claws, and boundless sword rays in its eyes. When Lin Yun’s aura reached its limit, Lin Yun swung his sword down and tore Yan Mo’s attack into pieces.

This scene shocked all of the cultivators on Profound Amber Mountain. But those from the Gauze Eastern Domain were sneering because they knew that the show was just starting.

Yan Mo smirked as his aura became even more violent. His eyes gradually became bloodshot as flames gathered in his eyes. At the same time, another pupil appeared in his eyes, the Bloodflame Pupil. When this appeared, it instantly caused a commotion on Profound Amber Mountain as many people’s faces changed.

“Bloodflame Pupil… that’s a sign that the massacre intent reached the second stage. Isn’t he afraid of suffering a backlash?” Qing Tu sighed with a grave expression.

Back in the hall, Yan Mo’s sword intent was completely overshadowed by his massacre intent. The terrifying massacre aura spread throughout the hall and emitted dense bloodlust.

Seeing this scene, Lin Yun’s face became grave. The Profound Amber Realm had many hidden dragons and crouching tigers. Yan Mo was truly terrifying.

“You must be surprised, right? The sword is your life, but it’s just a tool to me. In terms of swords, I can never be compared to you. After all, you’re the only person to grasp spiritual sword intent before reaching the Heavenly Soul Realm. But I’m the only person who has grasped the second stage of massacre intent!” Flames blazed in Yan Mo’s pupils as he glared at Lin Yun.

At this moment, Lin Yun could feel his blood boil as the killing aura in his body showed signs of running amok.

“Go to hell!” Seeing this scene, Yan Mo laughed and threw his palm out before Lin Yun could react. When he pushed his palm out, the entire hall was instantly enveloped in dense crimson radiance that looked like blood.
