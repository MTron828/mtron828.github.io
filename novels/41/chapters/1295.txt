Chapter 1296 - Power of Firmament

The Silver-eyed Demonic Corpses were terrifyingly strong, and they spent quite the effort to deal with them. If any one of them were to face all seven of them, they would definitely turn around and leave without any hesitation.

But who could’ve thought that there was nothing waiting for them after they spent such a great amount of effort clearing the demonic corpses? The three of them couldn’t accept this, and Ye Xun’s face sank as he turned to look at Fang Muyang, “You’re the one who chose the path, so I need an explanation. Life path? My Heavenly Blade Pavilion lost several disciples, and I’ve been putting up with you for a long time!”

“You don’t look that impressive after all. Fengshui? I’m afraid you still need to study more,” said Xia Yunzhen coldly.

Their words made Fang Muyang’s face turn red, but he couldn’t refute them. A long time later, he awkwardly said, “Let’s look around, then. There might be other treasures around.”

“There’s nothing!” Xia Yunzhen said.

“Senior Brother, I found some fur belonging to a demonic beast.” The moment he was done yelling, several Thunder Sect disciples came with some black fur in their hands.

This instantly made Ye Xun stunned before he snickered, “So we found some fur. Xia Yunzhen, since your junior brothers have found them with such great effort, why don’t you keep them. At least that’s something.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Get lost!” Xia Yunzhen yelled, causing the other Heavenly Blade Pavilion disciples to start laughing. After all, Xia Yunzhen looked really generous earlier, as if he had already taken the Dragon Saint Pellet. So they couldn’t help laughing when they saw his current reaction.

“Wait!” Fang Muyang stowed his fan and yelled before taking the fur and examined it.

As his face gradually became solemn, Ye Xun and Xia Yunzhen came over and asked, “What did you discover?”

Raising his head, Fang Muyang said, “If I remember correctly, that guy should have a black dragon-blooded cat by his side.”

“It was him?!” Ye Xun and Xia Yunzhen yelled as they recalled the youth wearing a silver mask.

“He’s courting death!” Killing intent began to surge within Xia Yunzhen’s eyes because this meant that the Dragon Saint Pellet was taken by someone else, and this was something he couldn’t accept.

“Let’s chase after him!” It didn’t take long for the group to arrive at the third level, and they casually found a path before charging over.

“Wait, let me look for the right path.” Fang Muyang called out to them, but the two of them simply turned around and glared at him. This made Fang Muyang awkward before he smiled. “It’ll definitely work this time.”

Taking out the jade plaque again, he said in a confident tone, “We’ll take the death path. Believe me one more time.”

They took the life path earlier and were in great danger, so he was confident that he could get his face back this time.

“One last time!” Ye Xun and Xia Yunzhen decided to give Fang Muyang one more chance. After all, they weren’t too bothered with whatever path they took.

“Trust me, nothing will go wrong this time.” Fang Muyang smiled, “With our strength, we can easily catch up to that brat as long as we’re on the right path. At that time, we’ll make him spit out everything he has taken, and we have to unmask him to see who the hell he is!”

Meanwhile, Lin Yun had already reached the core of the third level. The entire journey was smooth since Lil’ Purple picked the life path, and there were also seven black-clothed elders facing the altar with devoted expressions.

They seemed to be praying with devotion to the altar, but they had all been turned into demonic corpses now. This made Lin Yun curious, so he asked, “What are they refining?”

Unlike the previous level, this altar was giving off the smell of blood, but the smell wasn’t evil and even gave off a sacred aura instead.

“Probably a saint artifact. After all, a saint artifact with a spirit is a monarch saint artifact, and it has to be at least a thousand-rune saint artifact.” Lil’ Purple shared her speculation.

A monarch saint artifact? Lin Yun had interacted with the Flame Dragon Sect and knew that their saint artifact contained a droplet of the jiao-dragon saint blood, allowing it to reach the height of a monarch saint artifact. But when the blood was completely exhausted, the power would greatly drop.

So those saint artifacts couldn’t be considered genuine monarch saint artifacts, but they were still a lot stronger than ordinary ones. If it were saint artifacts, Lin Yun didn’t have much desire because he was a swordsman. Even if it was a saint sword, it might also not be as strong as the Lightning Shadow Sword.

The Lightning Shadow Sword didn’t have a spirit, but it had a complete divine rune. If it had a spirit, then it would immediately become a divine artifact.

“Let me do it.” Seeing that Lil’ Purple was going to make a move, Lin Yun called out to stop her.

“This empress can do it. I’m not as weak as you think…” Lil’ Purple looked at Lin Yun unhappily.

“They’re merely Silver-eyed Demonic Corpses. There’s no need for you to make a move personally, and I’ll still be counting on you when we go against the three Greater Elysium Core Realms from the three sects,” smiled Lin Yun. He didn’t want Lil’ Purple to force herself because her face was terrifyingly pale before.

She had recovered some of her strength since then, but she was still weak. At the very least, she was weaker than him. But in terms of eyesight or spiritual runes, there was no way Lin Yun could be compared to her.

“That makes some sense. Then you have to be careful. The Silver-eyed Demonic Corpses are hard to deal with, and they’ve at least manifested their constellations when they were alive.” Lil’ Purple smiled upon hearing Lin Yun’s praises.

“Then, let me give it a try.” Lin Yun removed the Silver Moon Mask and revealed his actual appearance. When he took a step forth, his killing intent surged forth, not bothering to conceal it.

This instantly alarmed the seven demonic corpses and they immediately summoned their constellations. When seven ancient constellations appeared before Lin Yun, he saw that each of the paintings had an azure dragon enveloped in a demonic aura on them.

This instantly made Lin Yun feel a huge pressure, and the dragon runes were having a hard time resisting the pressure. At the same time, the demonic corpses charged over and even executed the martial techniques from when they were still alive.

“Come on!” Lin Yun took a deep breath with fighting spirit blazing in his pupils. The golden sword ocean in his forehead also began to surge and an azure dragon burst from the ocean. When Lin Yun unleashed his firmament sword intent, he began to glow with golden light, as if he was a statue forged from gold, looking like a deity who descended onto the mortal realm.

When Lin Yun let out a roar, both of his hands joined together to form a seal with the golden human in his sword ocean. “Divine Azure Annihilation!”

The azure dragon in his sword ocean was one of Lin Yun’s sword souls, and it was like a vivid dragon that couldn’t be tamed. But the golden human was like a deity and was even more terrifying than the azure dragon sword soul. When sword intent empowered the azure dragon, the golden human reached out and instantly restricted the azure dragon.

When the azure dragon flew from his forehead, all the demonic lights in its path were reduced to nothingness, including the spiritual energy in the surroundings. It was almost like an invisible wall that sent the seven demonic corpses flying back.

When the demonic corpses landed on the ground, Lin Yun let out a cold snort before he took a step forth. As his hair began to flutter, the seven demonic corpses fell to their knees and their struggles were futile. At the same time, fine cracks also began to appear on the surface of their bodies.

When Lin Yun took another step forth, the seven demonic corpses were all destroyed under the Divine Azure Annihilation, and the power of Lin Yun’s attack even left cracks in the surrounding space.

“What powerful firmament sword intent…” Lil’ Purple’s eyes lit up, and she felt safe standing behind Lin Yun. The firmament sword intent was a lot more powerful in Lin Yun’s hands because he possessed dual sword souls.

When he was done, Lin Yun flew to the altar. When the dragon runes on the altar manifested into dragons and charged at him once more, Lin Yun formed seals with his hands once more. “Divine Azure Annihilation!”

The azure dragon sword soul that was released converged onto Lin Yun’s forehead, making it look as if Lin Yun had another eye growing from it. When a golden beam shot out, the dragons were destroyed before they could even get close. Only after the dragons were destroyed did Lin Yun disperse his firmament sword intent and land on the altar.
