Chapter 2455 - Curtain Falls

“We pay our greetings to the Empress!” When they saw the Empress, the Silver Dragon King, and three holy lands’ emperors cupped their fists with one knee on the ground.

Everyone from the Sword Sect’s side remained indifferent, with no intentions of paying their respect. They only cupped their fists when they saw Yu Qingfeng.

The Empress swept her gaze through, stopping briefly at Liu Wuxie and Su Ziyao. Ultimately, her gaze fell onto the Radiant Sword Emperor, saying, “Radiant, congratulations on reaching the Emperor Realm.”

“I believe that without your ‘concern,’ my tribulation might be easier,” the Radiant Sword Emperor said. He didn’t give the Empress a face, which was no different from flipping the table. Then again, he couldn’t be bothered by the Empress’ identity.

The Empress said, “You’re right, but you’re smart. You should know that if I’m determined to stop you from becoming an Emperor, no one can stop me, not even Yu Qingfeng.”

“Don’t be so sure about that,” Yu Qingfeng smiled.

When he heard that, Lin Yun couldn’t hold back his laughter, but he quickly covered his mouth. His master was enough, but he didn’t expect Yu Qingfeng to show mercy. Then again, what he said wasn’t wrong because if the Empress was determined to stop his master from reaching the Emperor Realm, Yu Qingfeng could ensure that no one from the Profound Imperial Palace became an Emperor.

It wasn’t because the Empress was benevolent that she didn’t stop the Radiant Sword Emperor from becoming an Emperor, but she feared Yu Qingfeng’s strength. This was because Yu Qingfeng would make a move.

The Empress’ face sank and glared at Yu Qingfeng. Murderous intent swept out from her, making everyone present tremble and nervous.

“You want to fight?” Yu Qingfeng raised his brow. He looked at the Empress fearlessly and smiled, “The Quasi-Deity Realm isn’t invincible.”

Suddenly, the Blade and Flame Emperors appeared on the Scarlet Firmament Peak from the Divine Firmament Peak.

The Flame Emperor nodded at the Empress, which relieved the Empress.

But their appearance and the direction they came from made the Radiant Sword Emperor nervous. He asked, “Where’s my junior brother?” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“He’s fine, don’t worry,” the Flame Emperor replied.

“Senior Brother, I’m fine...” The Dustlight Great Saint flew over from the Divine Firmament Peak. The Radiant Sword Emperor quickly asked about the dragon vein, but the Dustlight Great Saint replied with a complicated expression, “We’ll talk about it later.”

“I’m not here to waste saliva with you. Su Ziyao, why aren’t you admitting your mistake after seeing me?” The Empress said coldly, looking at Su Ziyao while suppressing her anger.

“What mistake does she have to help my master in his tribulation?” Lin Yun stood before Su Ziyao on the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron, looking at the Empress fearlessly.

“She knows it in her heart. Su Ziyao, are you coming with me, or do you want me to bring you away?” The Empress’s gaze was on Su Ziyao the entire time.

“I’ll come with you,” Su Ziyao said, taking a deep breath.

“Ziyao!” Lin Yun looked at Su Ziyao, puzzled.

“The Empress Heart Sutra, the deeper I love, the more pain I feel. I don’t know why I wanted to get close to you in the past despite the pain, but I now know. I’m happy when I’m with you because I’m living for myself,” Su Ziyao said. “Since she can bring me away, you can bring me back. Lin Yun, you have to bring me back!”

Now that everything had settled down, Su Ziyao didn’t want the Emperors to fight over her, especially mythical emperors. But she believed Lin Yun would bring her back if he gave the word.

“I will bring you back for sure!” Lin Yun said.

“I believe you!” Su Ziyao wore a gentle smile and kissed Lin Yun on his lips.

When the Empress saw this, her face became dark with a complicated gaze.

Jumping down from the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron, the Empress soared to the sky, bringing Su Ziyao as they headed toward the Divine Dragon Empire.

“Let’s put that aside for now and listen to Dustlight. It seems that the dragon vein isn’t in a good situation,” Yu Qingfeng said, seeing that Lin Yun was still looking in the direction Su Ziyao left.

Seeing that everyone looked at him, the Dustlight Great Saint told everyone what happened in the Nether Palace.

Mu Xuankong said, “The Flame Emperor didn’t take the Ancient Barren Dragon Vein, but the Dragon Suppression Monument suppressed it. If the Empress holds the ceremony, she can extract the dragon vein for herself?”

Everyone’s face sank upon hearing that. The Ancient Barren Dragon Vein might not be seized, but it wasn’t much different.

The Radiant Sword Emperor said, “You don’t have to blame yourself. If I were you, I would also make the same decision.”

“This is my fault,” Yu Qingfeng said. “I never expect her to reach the Quasi-Deity Realm suddenly, and it’s not easy to defeat her now.”

Everyone was grateful that the Sword Emperor could help him, and none of them blamed him for it. In a nutshell, there was no way the Dustlight Great Saint could stop the Flame Emperor, and the latter could seize the dragon vein forcibly. Now that the dragon vein was only suppressed, the Flame Emperor already held back.

“No need to worry about it. Even if the dragon vein destroys the sect, we can leave the Sword Sect’s inheritance in the Heavenly Dao Sect. The Heavenly Dao Sect can merge with the Sword Sect, and the Thousand Plume Great Saint mentioned it to me. As long as junior brother can find the Emperor Sword back, he can become the sect master any time,” Ye Guhan said.

The moment he said that everyone’s eyes lit up because this was an opportunity. The Heavenly Dao Sect suffered a heavy blow because of the Blood Moon Sect and Demonspirit Clan. They were no longer the strongest holy land in Eastern Desolation.

The Sword Sect also took a heavy blow, but the Radiant Sword Emperor successfully became an Emperor. The two could complement each other well. Most importantly, Lin Yun had stayed in both clans, and he could connect the two.

No matter what, this incident had finally ended, and the Radiant Sword Emperor thanked everyone who came to help. After the Empress left, cultivators still came from everywhere to congratulate. These people were sincere about it, and the Sword Sect suddenly bustled.

Mister Ghost pulled Lin Yun aside and said, “The divine maiden accepts the Demon Emperor’s inheritance, and she will become the Demon Gate’s lord. She has to give up many things in that spot, including her relationship with you.”

“The divine maiden is An Liuyan?” Lin Yun asked.

“That’s right,” Mister Ghost nodded. He continued, “Before accepting the inheritance, she asked me to help in your master’s tribulation...”

Lin Yun interrupted, “I’m grateful you can help in my mater’s tribulation, but tell her I won’t agree. If anyone forced her to do it, I would take a trip to the Demon Gate. I won’t let her suffer any grievance, not even that Demon Emperor.”

Lin Yun already didn’t care about many things, just like Su Ziyao publicly declared she was his wife. He also didn’t want to hide the fact that An Liuyan was his woman, and no one could bully him.

Mister Ghost was stunned and said in a self-mocking tone, “The Demon Emperor already died nine hundred years ago. She won’t have to give up if the Demon Emperor is still around, but it’s precisely because the Demon Emperor is no longer around. Some people fear you’ll control the Demon Gate through her.”

“Very well. Pass my message for me. I won’t interfere with Demon Gate’s affairs, but the Demon Gate isn’t allowed to interfere in An Liuyan’s affairs. I have some matters to attend to, and I must leave momentarily,” Lin Yun said. He nodded at Mister Ghost before walking over to his master, whispering in his master’s ears.

The Radiant Sword Emperor looked in a specific direction and said, “Come back quickly. I just knew that the Black and White Emperors were here, and they brought something you need after everyone leaves.”

The Scarlet Firmament Peak was filled with people, and the Radiant Sword Emperor couldn’t possibly chase everyone away.

Lin Yun was shocked to hear that the Black and White Emperors were here, and he had something to attend to.

“Scumbag, where are you going?” Lil’ Purple asked, grabbing onto his hand. She said furiously, “Su Ziyao just left, and you want to meet another woman? I have to come along as well!”

Lin Yun smiled bitterly because Lil’ Purple was right. He smiled, “Sure, come along.”

It had been a long time since they last met, and Lin Yun couldn’t possibly chase her away. They soared to the sky and arrived in a remote mountain in the Sword Sect.

On the mountain, Mu Xueling was already waiting as she looked at the clouds, turning around when she sensed Lin Yun’s arrival.

Lil’ Purple instantly recognized Mu Xueling and her expression loosened up.

“Thank you for your help, Saint Elder,” Lin Yun cupped his fists together.

“You’re too polite,” Mu Xueling smiled and said nothing else as they simply looked at each other.

This had nothing to do with Lil’ Purple, and Lin Yun didn’t know how to speak even if Lil’ Purple wasn’t here. He had no reservations against Mu Xueling on the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain, and the situation was weird now. Ultimately, he broke the silence and said, “Saint Elder, you have already grasped the Divine Dragon Tone?”

Taking a deep breath, Mu Xueling mustered her courage and said, “Only when I’m playing the Nichang Dress Song.”

Lin Yun was stumped when he heard that.

After revealing everything, Mu Xueling looked relaxed and smiled, “You were right back then. I was the one who taught you the Nichang Dress Song, but you taught it to me in the end.”

Lil’ Purple scratched her head and couldn’t understand Mu Xueling's meaning. She could feel something between the two but couldn’t describe it.

This was a secret between Lin Yun and Mu Xueling. The Nichang Dress Song can only reach perfection if you are playing for someone you love.

Mu Xueling smiled, “I don’t understand in the past why moths would chase after light even if they might be burnt to death, but I do now, and I want to remember this feeling.”

“Come and find me at the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain if you’re free.” Mu Xueling flew away while Lin Yun looked to be at a loss.

Lil’ Purple repeated in a funny tone, “Come and find me at the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain if you’re free.”
