Chapter 1412 - So It's You!

Xiahou Yan had flipped the table with no intention of being polite with the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect and Lin Yun. When Lin Yun wanted him to apologize, he had already crossed his bottom line.

Who did Lin Yun think he was? Lin Yun wanted him to apologize in public? So what if he was the champion of the Ninth Heavenly Path?

Lin Yun had only been in the Kunlun Realm for a year. When Xiahou Yan became famous, Lin Yun was nothing in his eyes. Not only in the Ancient Barren Domain, Xiahou Yan had some fame throughout the entire Eastern Desolation.

Since Lin Yun wasn’t willing to listen when he was still polite, he couldn’t be blamed for being impolite.

Gongsun Yan mustered his courage, “Xiahou Yan, don’t you have some shame as someone acknowledged as the leader amongst all swordsmen in the younger generation?”

“Who the hell do you think you are?” Xiahou Yan’s eyes flashed with mockery. “Others might not know about your origin, but do you think I don’t? You’re just a bastard child of the Skysolute City, bluffing everyone in the Ancient Barren Domain by claiming to be from the Sword Emperor’s lineage. A piece of trash like you truly disgusts me.”

“You!” Gongsun Yan’s face turned red because he hated it when people exposed his origins, especially the word “bastard” that was his achilles heel. Gongsun Yan naturally lost his composure and charged at Xiahou Yan, “You’re courting death!”

“Wait!” Zhao Yan’s face changed. He wanted to stop Gongsun Yan, but he was too late because Gongsun Yan had appeared before Xiahou Yan, radiating with dazzling sword rays.

When Gongsun Yan’s sword aura exploded, he used the Heavenly Sword Sutra that Sword Emperor Yu Qingfeng gave him. Upon reaching a high stage, one could start condensing innate saint aura. It was a powerful ghost spirit cultivation technique. Even if Gongsun Yan had just achieved entry-level, it was enough for him to display incredible power.

“What fast speed!” The two Saint Clans and the four brothers of the Huang Clan were surprised by Gongsun Yan’s speed, which proved that the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s party was strong. But what happened next was even more shocking. Xiahou Yan merely stretched his hand out.

When he stretched his hand out, a hand manifested into the sky, enveloping Gongsun Yan. This made the dazzling light released from Gongsun Yan dim like a fire being extinguished by water. This surprised everyone because Xiahou Yan was too strong.

The four brothers of the Huang Clan exchanged glances and could see the shock in each other’s eyes. They also knew that they had made the right choice by cooperating with Xiahou Yan, which made Huang Clan's eldest brother smile.

“This…” Gongsun Yan was shocked to discover that his sword intent was like cotton before Xiahou Yan without any sharpness that a sword should possess. Before Gongsun Yan could respond, Xiahou Yan gave him a slap that forced him onto his knees. This made Gongsun Yan feel extremely humiliated, but there was nothing he could do about it.

“It has been a long time since we met. You’re still the same bastard from back then, but it looks like you’ve become more courteous.” Xiahou Yan looked at Gongsun Yan with disdain. His eyes were filled with mockery because his Innate Sword Physique and Innate Sword Heart gave him the capital to be arrogant. He looked down on Gongsun Yan from the bottom of his heart, and just Gongsun Yan’s birth origin alone was enough to make him feel disgusted.

“Xiahou Yan! Kill me if you have the guts! Otherwise, I swear that I’ll take revenge in the future!” Gongsun Yan roared.

“Kill you?” Xiahou Yan snickered. “I find it dirty even to slap you, so what makes you think trash like you have the qualifications to be killed by me? I, Xiahou Yan, don’t kill nameless people. In my eyes, you’re no different from a dog, so why should I kill you?”

When he was done, he gave Gongsun Yan a kick to his chest, causing Gongsun Yan to throw out a mouthful of blood with his chest caved in. When Gongsun Yan let out a miserable scream, his face was distorted from the pain. His state made Ye Ziling and the others feel a chill down their spines with rage flaming in their pupils.

Zhao Yan caught Gongsun Yan with a flash, but he discovered that Gongsun Yan had already fainted from the pain. But when he fainted, Gongsun Yan still clenched his fist with reluctance written on his face.

“Xiahou Yan, remember what you said today.” Zhao Yan said with an unprecedented cold light flashing through his pupils.

“You overthink this because none of you can leave today!” Xiahou Yan then waved his hand.

“Split up!” Ye Ziling gave a decisive order. They weren’t on the same level as the other party. So even if Ye Ziling was reluctant, she still made the right decision.

Without hesitation, everyone executed their movement techniques and headed in different directions. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Just when Xiahou Yan was about to get the geniuses of two Saint Clans to chase after them, the eldest brother of the Huang Clan, Huang Yancheng, smiled. “Brother Xiahou, why don’t you leave something like this to us? There’s no need for you to make a big fuss over this. My fourth younger brother alone is enough to bring them back.”

“Oh?” Xiahou Yan exclaimed without any changes on his face.

When Huang Yancheng smiled, he turned to the black-clothed youth amongst the four, “Brother, let Brother Xiahou have a look.”

“It’s nothing much. Big Brother Xiahou just has to wait here, and none of you have to move.” The black-clothed youth stood out with an eerie smile on his face.

The geniuses of the two Saint Clans were surprised and had doubt written on their faces. The Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s party wasn’t weak, especially Zhao Yan and Ye Ziling. Aside from Xiahou Yan, they didn’t think that any one of them could fight those two. So wasn’t the Huang Clan a little too over-confident? This made them curious if the Ancient Saint Clans had any trump cards.

The black-clothed youth smiled and took out a peculiar bone flute from his interspatial pouch. When he blew the flute, a piece of eerie music resounded like ghostly wails.

When everyone was baffled, a series of ferocious roars echoed from the woods, as if something was running amok. The entire ground also began to tremble as if the apocalypse had arrived with those demonic beasts under control.

“Saint spiritualist!” Bai Zhanli murmured with fear flashing through his pupils. This probably meant that he used this method to control the two monarch demonic beasts. They initially planned on waiting for Lin Yun and his party to be exhausted before they appeared. But they never expected that Lin Yun would face the two demonic beasts by himself, allowing Ye Ziling and the others to escape.

Although Xiahou Yan had no changes on his face, this scene caused his heart to ripple. The youngest brother of the Huang Clan could only guide monarch demonic beasts with his flute and not control them. But as for other demonic beasts, he could practically put them under his control. Judging from the roars from the surroundings, he was at least in control of a hundred demonic beasts!

“How is it? What do you think of my younger brother’s ability?” Huang Yancheng smiled.

“It’s not simple.” Xiahou Yan sent a deep look at the black-clothed youth.

As Huang Yancheng’s eyes flashed with pride, he smiled, “It’s nothing compared to Brother Xiahou’s firmament sword intent. With us joining forces, we can easily obtain the treasure in the sword mound. As for these people, they’ll come back in an hour at most, so Brother Xiahou can do what you want to them then. Consider this a meeting gift from me.”

Xiahou Yan maintained his silence because Huang Yancheng displayed his strength. Not only was Huang Yancheng showing his worth, but this was also a threat. Not to mention that the four brothers of the Huang Clan weren’t simple. They were all enveloped in a terrifying baleful aura.

But he, Xiahou Yan, wasn’t a pushover either. If ‘that’ treasure was really in the sword mound, as told by Huang Yancheng, he wouldn’t mind working with them. But as for the ownership of that treasure, it would depend on their abilities. The two had their own thoughts but were polite to each other on the surface.

Ye Ziling was facing a siege of ten-odd demonic beasts while she was running, and they were all overlord demonic beasts at the Greater Elysium Core Realm. They either came alone, or they came in a small pack. But it wasn’t a problem for Ye Ziling to protect herself, even if she couldn’t kill them.

But when their numbers reached ten, it placed Ye Ziling in a tough position. It didn’t take long for her to be injured since the bloodline of demonic beasts in this secret realm contained sword intent. So injuries dealt by them weren’t easy to heal.

She wasn’t the only one, there were demonic beasts trapping everyone else. No matter what they did, they couldn’t escape and could only be forced to retreat by those demonic beasts. This made them despair. It was as if the demonic beasts were endless, and they had all gone berserk; none of them were afraid of death.

The time it took for half an incense to burn later, Ye Ziling was the first to return. When everyone from the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect returned, they were all covered in injuries. Feng Zhang and Liu Qingyan even suffered severe injuries.

When they were forced to return, the demonic beasts only roared at them from afar and didn’t approach any further. When the black-clothed youth saw that the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s party had returned, he merely smiled before he backed down.

“The brothers of the Huang Clan, as impressive as rumored.” Xiahou Yan said after taking a glance at the black-clothed youth.

“Xiahou Yan, what do you want?” Ye Ziling gritted her teeth with her face dark.

Responding to Ye Ziling, Xiahou Yan merely smiled, “What do I want? Don’t you know already? I want to see if you guys or the Bodhi Seed is more important to Flower Burial!”

“You’re shameless!” Ye Ziling was furious because Lin Yun faced two Azureflame Dracoserpents alone to let them escape. Not only could they not do anything to help him, but they even became Lin Yun’s burden.

“I’m shameless?” Xiahou Yan coldly replied. “Am I more shameless than Lin Yun? He bullied my younger brother with the firmament sword intent and even wanted me to apologize in public. I have never seen someone as arrogant as him!”

“So, you’re the one behind all of this…” A voice echoed right at this moment as the surrounding temperature dropped.
