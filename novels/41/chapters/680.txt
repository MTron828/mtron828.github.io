Chapter 681 - Bitter Fight

The Heavenly Soul Realm expert soared into the sky and drew his sword, releasing a three hundred meters sword ray that crashed into the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture. This slowed the violent attacks of the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture.

But under the stalemate, anyone could tell that the Heavenly Soul Realm expert’s and the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture weren’t on the same level. The sword ray was radiant, but it couldn’t stop the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture’s descending figure as cracks began to appear on the Heavenly Soul Realm expert’s sword aura. Clearly, he had underestimated the power of he Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture.

“Ironblood Sword Array!” The Ironblood Sword Gate’s sect master barked with a grave expression as he soared into the sky with the two other vice-sect masters. Beneath them, the Ironblood Sword Gate’s disciples began to brandish their swords, unleashing a boundless sword intent that gathered onto the three sect masters.

Empowered by the massive sword intent, the sword aura glowed even more brightly and lit up the sky.

“Get lost!” Surging with sword intent, the Heavenly Soul Realm expert swung his sword out, unleashing another three hundred meter long sword ray onto the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture. He even created a phenomenon with crimson lighting.

The Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture released a furious roar as it didn’t dare to be careless. As countless purple lightning began to gather on its body, it actually formed an armor that surrounded its entire body.

Then, the Heavenly Soul Realm expert, who had been empowered by the Ironblood Sword Array, swung his sword at the purple lightning armor.

As cracks sounded out, the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture’s colossal figure fell down from the sky. But just when it was about to land onto the ground, a dazzling outburst of lightning exploded, reducing everything in the surroundings into ashes.

“The Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture is injured!” The Ironblood Sword Gate’s disciples cheered at this sight.

Only the Heavenly Soul Realm expert had his brows locked together. Although his attack was terrifying, it couldn’t even break through the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture’s defences. All he did was destroy the armor protecting it.

Meanwhile, Lin Yun was shocked to look at this scene from afar. But when he swept his glance out at Tang Ying, his face sank with chill gathering in his pupils.

“Soon!” Lin Yun’s face was cold and covered with a killing aura.

As the lightning dispersed out on the ground, a violent cry echoed out along with a storm consisting of demonic aura.

“Damn it!” The smile soon disappeared on the faces of the Ironblood Sword Gate’s disciples when they saw this scene. Before they could even react, the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture charged over and slammed into the Ironblood Sword Array. The terrifying force from the collision instantly left cracks on the array.

Under the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture’s violent attacks, the faces of everyone in the array turned ugly and blood flowed out of their mouths. However, they gnashed their teeth and persisted.

The Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture let out a breath before sweeping its gaze at everyone, as if it was trying to find something. Suddenly, its gaze fell onto the white-clothed youth who was well-protected in the array. Letting out a cry, the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture pounced over.

“Stop!” The Heavenly Soul Realm expert roared as his sword intent began to gush out from his body like a tidal wave. He raised his sword high before slashing down.

“Ironblood Sword Array—All for One!” The Ironblood Sword Gate’s sect master roared as all the disciples began to change their formation. Countless crimson sword rays soared into the sky and landed on the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture.

Under the attacks from the Heavenly Soul Realm expert and the Ironblood Sword Array, the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture was instantly covered with injuries. But it didn’t care about its injuries as it was fixated on the white-clothed youth, charging over without care.

“Ironblood Sword Array—Divine Mist Sword!” The sect master roared once more as a mist began to spread out within the array. From afar, it looked like a ferocious tiger.

The Heavenly Soul Realm expert landed on the head of the tiger. Then, with their combined aura, they slashed at the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture again.

There were no tricks or special techniques in this collision. It was a pure collision of strength. After all, techniques and tricks would be nothing before immense power that could even tear a greater Yin-Yang stage expert apart.

Under the bombardment of sword rays, the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture was sent flying away. Right at this moment, the crimson tiger roared at the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture.

As the Heavenly Soul Realm expert formed a seal, sword intent began to gather on the soundwaves of the roar, which made it even more powerful.

Once again, the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture was knocked away with more injuries on its body. The battle was extremely bitter.

Just when everyone felt relieved, the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture suddenly stood up and unleashed an unprecedented rage and violent aura. Without any signs, it started to flap its green wings that swept up a powerful gust.

The gust was like a colossal mountain as it slammed onto the ferocious tiger with countless purple lightning that descended onto it as well. This sudden change had caused many of the Ironblood Sword Gate’s disciples to be heavily injured. Even with the Heavenly Soul Realm expert at the front to defend, the Ironblood Sword Array was still on the verge of collapsing.

When the sword array suddenly exploded, everyone was thrown like ragdolls.

“It’s finally come to an end.” Lin Yun watched the sword array being destroyed without any change to his expression. He knew that without the sword array, not even the Heavenly Soul Realm expert could fight with the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture.

“Damn it!” The Heavenly Soul Realm expert’s face changed as he cursed. Unleashing a roar, his blood shot out from his acupoints that contained his will.

Just when Lin Yun was baffled at what the Heavenly Soul Realm expert was doing, the latter said in a solemn voice, “We’re forced into such a terrible state by a demonic beast. I, Murong Fei, a swordsman, request senior’s help!”

“We request senior’s help!” Many of the Ironblood Sword Gate’s disciples all kneeled onto the ground.

Suddenly, the sword hovering in the sky suddenly trembled as if it was responding to everyone. The Heavenly Soul Realm expert’s eyes flashed coldly as he formed a seal, “Slash!” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The sword hovering in the sky released a radiant glow that lit up the sky, leaving a huge wound of a hundred meters on the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture.

“Slash!” The Heavenly Soul Realm expert roared once more and his face had turned even paler. This sent the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture flying once more.

“Slash again!” The Heavenly Soul Realm expert roared once more from the bottom of his heart. As a sword ray flashed, it practically cut off one of the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture’s wings. But at the same time, the Heavenly Soul Realm expert also fell from the sky as he had been greatly weakened.

“It makes no sense for the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture to come here. Clearly, there must be something on us.” The white-clothed youth suddenly said, which made Tang Ying’s heart tremble.

The Heavenly Soul Realm expert was briefly stunned before he started looking at everyone. When he saw the unusual expression on Tang Ying’s face, he barked, “Take it out.”

“I-I don’t have it…” Tang Ying said with his voice trembling.

Right at this moment, the Ironblood Sword Gate’s sect master said coldly, “Take it out if you want to live.”

In the end, Tang Ying hesitated for a long time before he took out the egg, “I don’t have anything else on me that seems unusual except for this.”

The Heavenly Soul Realm expert took it over and his face changed, “YOU BASTARD! THIS IS THE INDIGO THUNDERDEMON DRAGONVULTURE’S EGG! WHERE DID YOU GET THIS?! ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL US?!”

“I-I-It was given to me by a brat,” said Tang Ying with his face turning pale from the killing intent in the Heavenly Soul Realm expert’s eyes.

Right at this moment, the heavily injured Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture supported its body up as it crawled over coldly, which made everyone’s faces even uglier.
