Chapter 1520 - Finally Battle In The Trial Tower

Lin Yun would probably agree if he had no background because what Murong Chen said did make sense. No matter how strong he was, he was only at the Elysium Core Realm, while the seven demonic sects had many Dragon Pulse Realm deacons outside.

Let’s not mention that there were also Samsara Edict Realm powerhouses outside that could easily kill him. If Lin Yun didn’t have a background, it would be futile even if he obtained the Blue Dragon Bone. But he was the disciple of the Radiant Sword Saint, and he also had the Firmament Medal given to him by the sect master that could protect him from Samsara Edict Realm experts for an hour.

Just the name “Radiant Sword Saint” alone was enough to deter many people, not to mention he also had the painting given to him by his master. This was where Lin Yun’s confidence came from. With the Sword Sect and Radiant Sword Saint behind him, he didn’t have to lower his head to anyone.

“You want my Netherflower?” Murong Chen’s gaze sank, and he wore a mocking smile. “Then you better die!”

When he was done speaking, Murong Chen stepped forth and appeared before Lin Yun. His body turned into a gigantic ocean filled with astral energy. When he raised his hand, it formed into a massive wave that was pouring down from the sky.

But Lin Yun’s face was calm as he used his finger like a sword. The giant wave shattered when it landed on the finger, and Murong Chen was sent flying away.

“What powerful astral energy…” Murong Chen furrowed his brows with surprise flashing through his pupils. He could sense that there was something weird with Lin Yun’s cultivation. Lin Yun might only appear to be at the eight-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm, but Lin Yun could easily suppress him with his sword intent.

Although his attack was only to probe Lin Yun’s strength, it was clear that Lin Yun’s attack was casual. But Lin Yun had just reached the eight-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm, which meant that Lin Yun’s cultivation was lower than his. Thinking about that, Murong Chen instantly came up with a solution, and his aura was pushed to the limit, “Torrential Waves!”

As a terrifying aura was unleashed from the waves, it gave off the feeling that it could break apart the sky. Simultaneously, he executed a ghost spirit movement technique and merged with the ocean. This made him look agile. When he moved, every single step would unleash a terrifying power, which was why he could suppress all the geniuses that were in the same generation as him.

“You want to compete with me in terms of cultivation? I’m afraid that you found the wrong person!” Lin Yun didn’t panic, especially since he had refined the Divine Dragon Creation Pellet. When he pointed with his finger, sword rays were enveloped in layers of moonlight, and a terrifying storm swept out like flying azure dragons.

Ten moves later, Lin Yun let out a roar and combined all the sword rays. When he waved his hand, space was torn apart, and cracks began to spread across the ocean beneath Murong Chen.

“Interesting. Let’s see how you’ll take this palm of mine!” Murong Chen’s pupils blazed with flames. The shattered ocean turned into rivers, instantly turning his disadvantage into an advantage. As thousands of rivers unleashed an even more terrifying momentum than before, a palm descended with the intent that it could destroy everything.

Lin Yun had to admit that the martial techniques of the Netherworld Hall were impressive. But Lin Yun didn’t fear nether energy. If someone else was in his position, they would have trouble facing Murong Chen. But if Murong Chen thought he could defeat him with only this much, Lin Yun could only say that Murong Chen was too naive.

He had never been afraid when competing in martial techniques, not to mention that his Aquaheaven Sword Technique had long reached the manifestation stage. Murong Chen could turn the shattered ocean into thousands of rivers, but Lin Yun could instantly turn the heavenly water into a hundred and eight phenomena.

When all the phenomena overlapped, Lin Yun was brightly radiating with sword rays, and his aura reached an unprecedented height. When all the phenomena combined, he easily stopped Murong Chen from taking another step forth.

As his sword aura came crashing down, Lin Yun swung his sword with every step he took, unleashing all the profundity of the Aquaheaven Sword Technique and fully restrained Murong Chen’s palm technique. When the heavenly river descended, the thousands of rivers that were manifested by Murong Chen shattered.

Under the boundless sword rays, Lin Yun’s palm landed on Murong Chen’s chest, making the latter throw out a mouthful of blood before he was sent flying away.

But Lin Yun had no change on his face as he took a step forth and quickly caught up to Murong Chen. As he waved his hand, all sorts of sword auras overlapped before they flew towards the latter.

The two had exchanged over ten-odd moves in the blink of an eye. As Murong Chen threw out another mouthful of blood, he was sent flying away. When he was sent flying away, a Netherflower bloomed behind him, and he finally managed to stop Lin Yun’s attack.

When Murong Chen took three steps back, he easily resolved Lin Yun’s attack. But Lin Yun was surprised when he saw the Netherflower. This was because the Netherworld Art of the Netherworld Hall was similar to the Firmament Firmament Sword Sutra, which was a little incredible.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

When Murong Chen landed on the ground, he wiped the blood off the corner of his lips, and he didn’t seem that heavily injured. But when he looked at Lin Yun again, his face became grave. Right then, claps resounded as a person walked out from a passage. It was naturally Ling Qianye, who was late.

Wearing a smile, Ling Qianye said, “This is my first time seeing someone bringing a sword technique to the manifestation stage, and you’ve still not drawn your sword. I can’t imagine how strong you’ll become after drawing your sword, and I’m inquisitive about your true identity.”

Lin Yun and Murong Chen weren’t surprised at Ling Qianye’s appearance. Although they both used their strongest attacks, they were still probing each other since they had long sensed Ling Qianye’s existence.

Ling Qianye initially planned to appear later, but he never expected that Murong Chen would be so pathetic while Lin Yun and Murong Chen were just probing each other. He knew that the stalemate would continue if he didn’t appear. Those two weren’t fools; they wouldn’t fight for real as long as he was around.

“Ling Qianye, you should have made a decision now since you’ve been watching for a long time, right?” Murong Chen said while gritting his teeth.

As they talked, the seal on the box was lifted, and a draconic roar echoed. Shortly after, a boundless blue light shone out that soon filled every single corner of the hall, and a dragon bone that’s as long as an arm slowly hovered out of the box.

The dragon bone had a dragon coiling around it, radiating a draconic aura. When the powerful draconic aura swept out, the three were surprised and took several steps back. When they looked at the Blue Dragon Bone, their faces changed, and their gazes became grave.

Although they had long speculated that the Blue Dragon Bone would be here, they couldn’t help feeling shocked when they ultimately saw it and could feel their hearts throbbing violently. The Blue Dragon Bone emitted a monarch aura. Aside from that, the surface of the Blue Dragon Bone had an ancient rune shining brightly.

That was an origin divine rune. Seeing that this Blue Dragon Bone had an origin divine rune, the three’s eyes blazed with flames, and Lin Yun’s obsession finally reached a limit. He couldn’t believe that it was actually an origin divine rune. One must know that Qin Cang’s Golden Dragon Bone only had an origin saint rune, and a dragon bone with a divine rune differed from one without.

The three instantly became excited and felt that this was a vast fortune for them. Taking a deep breath, Lin Yun forced himself to calm down.

“Murong Chen, you don’t mind us joining hands, right?” Ling Qianye said while looking at Murong Chen.

“Definitely. No matter what, the Divine Dragon Bone belongs to the seven demonic sects, and it can’t fall into the hands of an outsider.” Murong Chen replied.

“Joining hands?” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with mockery. Just a moment ago, Murong Chen wanted to join forces with him to deal with Ling Qianye. But now, the two strongest chief disciples wanted to join forces against him. If the news of this spread out, it would definitely shock many people.

“Don’t blame us for being shameless. You can only blame yourself for being unfortunate!” Ling Qianye said. “Before I came here, I knew that you’re not that simple since someone already told me about you.”

“Nothing is fair in this world. I gave you an opportunity earlier, but it’s too late now, even if you go down on your knees.” Murong Chen coldly said.

The two were confident as they slowly walked towards Lin Yun. Lin Yun was strong, but they didn’t think that he could defeat the two of them.

“Is that so?” A cold light flashed through Lin Yun’s pupils, and the Flower Burial Sword flew out from his sword box. When Lin Yun’s left hand held onto the sword, his temperament suddenly changed. His gaze became ferocious, and he coldly said, “You guys still have the time to regret now. It’ll be too late for you once I draw my sword!”
