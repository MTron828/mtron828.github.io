Chapter 1784 - Lin Yun's Sword

When Lin Yun took a step forth, he flew out like a bolt of lightning. When he landed on the ground, a faint breeze blew past him. This made the Wind Edge Lord surprised. He was surprised because Lin Yun really dared to appear before him. Everyone at Thunderblood Square also seemed pretty surprised.

“Lin Xiao actually accepted the challenge!”

“Wind Edge Lord possesses the strength to compete for the top three. He’s not on the same level as the three swordsmen. There’s no way Lin Xiao’s sword intent can do anything to him.”

“Yeah. Unless he grasps the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent, the differences in their cultivation levels will be exposed. He will probably be defeated in just one move.”

“Quasi-Heavenly Dome Sword Intent is still not the genuine Heavenly Dome Sword Intent.”

“But the Wind Edge Lord is too much. If Lin Yun didn’t accept his challenge, the strongest swordsman on the Dragon Pulse Ranking would be a joke.”

The Wind Edge Lord was briefly stunned before he scoffed, “An insignificant brat who was at my West Garden Banquet back then actually dares to stand before me. I should’ve killed you with a slap back then.”

“Talk about that when you win. Otherwise, your face will hurt later when you fail.” Lin Yun lightly said. His arrogance made the surroundings fall into a dead silence because no one expected him to be so arrogant when facing the Wind Edge Lord.

The Wind Edge Lord also locked his brows together. Even if the three swordsmen joined hands, they were insignificant before him. He didn’t know where Lin Yun got such confidence to be so arrogant, but he probably had a trump card of some sort. But that didn’t matter because everyone was nothing but a joke before absolute strength.

“Your mouth is stinky, and you really need a beating.” The Wind Edge Lord coldly looked at Lin Yun. Flinging his sleeves, he leaped to the sky, and his speed was like lightning wrapped in the wind.

With incredible speed, the Wind Edge Lord swiftly came before Lin Yun and gave the latter a kick in the face. Space was smashed by him, and his path was accompanied by lightning and wind. But that wasn’t all because he had a swift kick. He had accumulated the explosive power of wind and lightning into his feet. There weren’t any fancy tricks in it.

But he was destined to be disappointed because Lin Yun was even faster than him. His Sword Heart instantly captured the Wind Edge Lord’s trajectory, and he drew his sword without any hesitation. His sword was like a comet streaking across the horizon before clashing against the Wind Edge Lord’s foot. Their collision was like two exploding stars, and a horrifying shockwave swept out, causing the stage to tremble.

“So fast?!” The Wind Edge Lord squinted his eyes because Lin Yun’s sword was faster than he expected. Not to mention Lin Yun even accurately calculated his trajectory.

But that wasn’t all. His subsequent attacks were blocked, and he never encountered this situation when he previously fought Shi Feng.

After knocking the Wind Edge Lord away with his sword, Lin Yun slowly raised his sword. As he slid forth, he saw an opening and swung his sword down. His sword was accompanied by the Quasi-Heavenly Dome Sword Intent as it tore the sky apart. It was like an axe that could slice through the sky, slicing apart the dragon origin around the Wind Edge Lord.

When his sword fell onto the Wind Edge Lord, it caused sparks to fly when it came into contact with his dragon scales. As they swiftly moved, their figures intertwined with sword rays rippling out.

Ten-odd moves later, an ear-piercing noise resounded. When the Flower Burial Sword flashed past, dragon scales flew around. The Flower Burial Sword was half an inch away from injuring the Wind Edge Lord.

This made Lin Yun feel pity. If he could injure Wind Edge Lord, his sword intent could penetrate into the latter’s body, and the latter would definitely be severely injured.

“You’re courting death!” The Wind Edge Lord flew into a rage, circulating the Silver Dragon Saint Physique. Nine dragon pulses that were close to four thousand feet also appeared behind him.

This was a shocking scene, and the aura from the Wind Edge Lord’s dragon pulses was like a mountain crashing down on Lin Yun’s sword aura.

“You think you’re the only one who’s practiced the Dragon Clan’s martial techniques? Divine Dragon Overlord Fist!” Wind Edge Lord roared, throwing a punch forth, and the power of his attack had multiplied compared to before.

This brought his already powerful dragon aura to a new height. He was confident that Lin Yun would lose if he only had the Quasi-Heavenly Dome Sword Intent when his cultivation was only at the seventh-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm.

Under the overwhelming pressure, Lin Yun nearly lost control of the seven dragon pulses that were nine thousand feet wide, and even his sword intent couldn’t suppress it. While a terrifying power surged within his body, his dragon origin was already boiling.

Simultaneously, Lin Yun could keenly sense the power of the dragon tribulation beyond the thirty-six layers of heaven. He raised his sword before him to block, but he was blown away before the Wind Edge Lord’s fist even reached him.

“Haha. The strongest swordsman on the Dragon Pulse Ranking? You don’t seem impressive at all. Today, I’ll tear your mouth apart and see if you still dare to be arrogant!” The Wind Edge Lord laughed as a silver light surged around him. He then dashed forth.

Every time he took a step, he would rise to the sky. When he landed on the ground, his footsteps were like mountains crashing down on the stage. In just seven to eight steps, he already came before Lin Yun with his dragon aura charging forth.

Fortunately, my Azure Dragon Intent reached the fifth grade just a moment ago. Otherwise, I would’ve lost control of my dragon pulses. Lin Yun thought to himself. Since he still didn’t want to undergo his tribulation, he could only bring out his fifth-grade Azure Dragon Intent.

The sword intent around Lin Yun suddenly reached a limit. If Lin Yun was only using the Quasi-Heavenly Dome Sword Intent earlier, it was now comparable to the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent when he fused his fifth-grade Azure Dragon Intent into his sword intent.

With the fifth-grade Azure Dragon Intent merging into his sword intent, his sword intent rapidly began to rise, and the feeling he gave off was like a peerless sword now. At the same time, he was also like a true dragon standing on the ocean.

“Nine Heavenly Storm!” Lin Yun held onto the Flower Burial Sword. As saint runes surged on his sword, a powerful wind swept with nine heaven-shattering sounds.

The Wind Edge Lord came quickly and also left quickly. Even if he was giving off a massive aura, he was sent flying under that sword.

“Oh, my god. What sword intent is that?”

“Fifth-grade Azure Dragon Intent merged into the Quasi-Heavenly Dome Sword Intent. I’m afraid that even the complete Heavenly Dome Sword Intent will be at this level.”

“Lin Xiao is simply a monster!”

“See? What did I say earlier? Lin Xiao is a peerless genius of the Azure Dragon’s lineage. You guys didn’t believe it earlier. What about now? Believe me now?” An uproar rang out from the surroundings. Those who guessed that Lin Yun was from the Azure Dragon’s lineage were emotional, wanting to charge onto the Thunderblood Battlestage. Then again, they were only thinking about it, since they would be dead if they really did charge in.

“Divine Dragon Overlord Fist—Shattering Moon!” A few exchanges later, the Wind Edge Lord soared to the sky with silver dragon flames blazing on him. As the flames gathered to a single point, they formed into a fist that flew out.

“Thunder Spike!” Lin Yun was already prepared, and nine lightning shackles enveloped his sword, radiating brightly before they gathered at the sword tip.

In the end, the sword tip broke the Wind Edge Lord’s attack. But Lin Yun’s sword aura was also affected, and his sword ray shattered. The Wind Edge Lord wasn’t too surprised because he already expected that Lin Yun had a trump card.

“Is this your trump card? It’s a pity because I’m just getting started. Hahaha!” The Wind Edge Lord laughed. As saint runes began to appear on the surface of his body, those runes began to ignite, and his silver flames became even more ferocious. That was the Silver Dragon Saint Flame.

This was his strongest trump card. Upon bringing it out, not only could he strengthen the Silver Dragon Saint Physique, it could also double the power of his Divine Dragon Overlord Fist. This was what he prepared to use against Ji Lingfeng, but it didn’t matter even if he used it now. It was fine even if he revealed it.

“Silver Dragon Saint Flame!”

“The Wind Edge Lord has resorted to his trump cards.”

“Lin Xiao is doomed…” Everyone discussed, but the three swordsmen, along with those from the Sword Sect, had their gazes gathered onto Lin Yun. Not only them, but Ji Lingfeng, Xiao Yuanqi, the Autumn Mountain Lord, the Snow Master Lord, Yi Feng, and many others have gathered their gazes onto Lin Yun.

“Talk again after you win. Otherwise, it’ll be really painful on your face.” Lin Yun held onto the Flower Burial Sword in his hand. As his sword intent began to surge, it was like a ripple spreading out that gave everyone an unfathomable feeling. His forehead began to heat up, and the azure dragon sword soul flew out under the manipulation of the golden human.

As the azure dragon sword soul entered his sword intent, it further strengthened his sword intent. The sword vibration sounded like a draconic roar, and this scene left everyone shocked because they recognized it was dual sword souls.Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Lin Xiao actually has dual sword souls?!”

“Isn’t his attainment in sword dao a little too terrifying? I doubt even a Samsara Edict Realm swordsman’s sword intent will be stronger than his.”

“Does that mean he didn’t even use his dual sword souls earlier?”

“How terrifying. This kind of sword intent really isn’t something that can be possessed in the Dragon Pulse Realm!”

The Wind Edge Lord was shocked while being in mid-air. He thought Lin Yun was already at his wit's end, but he never expected him to still have some trump cards left.

“I don’t believe I can’t defeat you!” The terrifying sword intent forced the Wind Edge Lord to his limit, and his fighting spirit also rose to an unprecedented height.

“Divine Dragon Overlord Fist!” Silver flames burst out, and the Wind Edge Lord flew towards him like a silver dragon, with his offensive and defensive abilities reaching a new height. Even someone who had just made a breakthrough to the Samsara Edict Realm might not be able to stop him.

Coming before Lin Yun, the Wind Edge Lord threw his punch forth. But that wasn’t all. His fist suddenly turned into a claw with his five fingers spread out, and a silver dragon appeared, opening its dragon claw.

When the fist and claw merged together. It wasn’t just the Divine Dragon Overlord Fist, the Divine Dragon Skytearing Claw was being used as well.

Facing the violent gale head-on, Lin Yun took a deep breath and unleashed the tenth sword form of the Azure Dragon Sword Art. This sword was born from the azure dragon, yet surpassed the azure dragon.

Under this powerful sword, the ground cracked along with the barrier enveloping the Thunderblood Battlestage. With that, the Dragon Pulse Ranking’s dragon spirit had no choice but to make a move again, strengthening the barrier around the Thunderblood Battlestage.

On the stage that was stained with blood, saint flames blazed, but their battle had just begun. They both reached their limit, one executing the Azure Dragon Sword Art and the other executing the Divine Dragon Overlord Fist.

I still have three trump cards, the Azure Dragon Sword Art in the deification stage, the eleventh sword form of the Azure Dragon Sword Art, and the complete Heavenly Dome Sword Intent. Lin Yun’s thoughts processed quickly during the battle. Compared to the Wind Edge Lord, he was calmer in the fight.

“I can’t continue like this any longer, so I have to unleash the decisive blow.” The Wind Edge Lord became anxious. After knocking a sword ray away with a punch, silver saint flames blazed on him once more.

“Let’s go with that, then.” Lin Yun finally decided which trump card to use, since he didn’t want to give the Wind Edge Lord the opportunity to accumulate his attack. When he turned around, he split into two. One was enveloped in the wind, and the other was enveloped in lightning.

This was the eleventh sword form of the Azure Dragon Sword Art—Unrivaled•Thunderstorm Slash!

While everyone was dumbfounded, the two afterimages swung their swords, unleashing two sword rays. When the two sword rays intertwined, the entire heaven and earth became chaotic. Space distorted, and the world was divided into four, dazzling everyone.

In the world separated into four, there was the Wind Edge Lord’s figure and Lin Yun’s sword rays. This sword wasn’t something that could be described with words.

As Lin Yun sheathed his sword, everything returned to normal. But at the point where the two sword rays met, the Wind Edge Lord looked as though he was being restricted, and he couldn’t move at all.

When Lin Yun fully sheathed his sword, the dragon scales on the Wind Edge Lord exploded. His Silver Dragon Saint Physique broke, with blood flowing out from his chest, making him look pathetic. After he landed on the ground, Lin Yun dashed over with a flash.

“What are you trying to do?” The Wind Edge Lord said in horror. He clutched his chest, and his hair was disheveled.

“I already said your face will hurt.” Lin Yun faced the Wind Edge Lord with a slap and sent him flying away. Everyone only saw a figure flying away like a ragdoll and landed on the pavilion where the other Four Young Masters were located.
