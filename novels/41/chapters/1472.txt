Chapter 1473 - I'm The Heaven!

That was the real firmament sword intent, where the sword intent manifests into the sky. Just looking at the majestic sky made everyone’s hearts tremble, and they couldn’t look at it directly. The pressure was something that not even Dragon Pulse Realm deacons could bear for long.

As Lin Yun swept his gaze over, an immense pressure came crashing down on Jin Xuanyi and Ji Shuxuan, increasing the pressure that they were feeling. In the end, the two threw out mouthfuls of blood because they finally couldn’t bear it any longer.

“Now, are you guys still unconvinced?” Lin Yun asked.

“Dream on!” Jin Xuanyi and Ji Shuxuan had rage flashing through their pupils and summoned their swords back to their hands. As their sword auras exploded with golden sword rays bloomed behind them. They swiftly manifested into two golden seas of clouds with golden thrones in the clouds.

The thrones had nine dragons engraved on it, and boundless sword auras swept out. When the monarch auras enveloped Jin Xuanyi and Ji Shuxuan, majestic aura waves swept out as they slowly got back to their feet. As the two sword auras overlapped, the sword rays emitted from them grew even brighter.

“It’s the Sun Splitting Skydome!” Bursts of exclamations resounded from the surroundings as everyone’s faces changed. This was because they recognized this famous ghost spirit sword technique of the Sword Sect.

As two sword rays swept out, they instantly separated the seas of clouds. Under their sword rays, Lin Yun’s firmament sword intent became dim. But that wasn’t all. When the sword rays resisted the pressure of the firmament sword, Ji Shuxuan and Jin Xuanyi soared into the sky and exchanged glances. They could both see the admiration in each other’s eyes.

“Sure enough, you’ve also grasped the second form…” The two smiled. Every single one of the sword forms was terrifying, and even Dragon Pulse Realm geniuses might not be able to grasp the second form.

“I initially prepared this sword for you.” Jin Xuanyi looked at Ji Shuxuan with a complicated gaze.

Jin Xuanyi initially planned to save that sword for Ji Shuxuan under the gazes of everyone in the Five Peaks Competition, wanting to get an outcome before reaching the Dragon Pulse Realm. But everything changed too quickly, which caught them by surprise. After all, who would’ve thought Lin Yun would be able to outshine the top ten of the Earth Ranking?

“That goes the same for me, but it doesn’t matter. I’ll wait till we’re in the Dragon Pulse Realm before we decide a winner amongst ourselves!” Ji Shuxuan smiled. “Now, we have to deal with him first. After all, we can’t possibly let everyone see the Twin Stars of the Earth Ranking become a joke in the final battle!”

“Hahaha! Good!” They exchanged a glance and put down their rivalry for now. Right now, their objective was to defeat Lin Yun.

They were the Twin Stars of the Earth Ranking and had never suffered such grievances. Since Lin Yun wanted a battle, they would give him a battle. As their fighting spirits blazed, everyone could feel their blood boiling.

“Moon Splitting Skydome!” Ji Shuxuan and Jin Xuanyi yelled as their monarch sword auras started to rise. When they swung their swords, the entire Celestial Observing Lake burst into an uproar.

The disciples of the Golden Firmament Peak and Scarlet Firmament Peak had become excited with their right hands clenched into fists with their bodies trembling.

After all, aside from the Divine Firmament Peak’s disciples, the four peaks had their own leaders, and none of them liked Lin Yun. So they could feel the grievances and humiliations after seeing their leaders being trampled upon by Lin Yun.

They naturally hoped that the Twin Stars of the Earth Ranking could turn the tables around and let Lin Yun have a taste of his own medicine. Lin Yun was too arrogant, but it made them furious because there was nothing they could do to him. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

So when they saw Jin Xuanyi and Ji Shuxuan joining hands and executing the second form of the Skydome 9 Swords, how could it not make their blood boil? Many Dragon Pulse Realm disciples on the Celestial Observing Stage were also shocked as they watched this scene.

“Why didn’t they use such a powerful move before? It looks like Lin Yun was right. Jin Xuanyi and Ji Shuxuan are both unconvinced!”

“When were they going to get the chance? The Aquaheaven Sword Technique is completely different in Lin Yun’s hands, and they didn’t have a chance at all. But they now have a chance that was given to them by Lin Yun.”

“This Five Peaks Competition is really filled with twists and turns. I’m afraid that the ownership of the ninth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flower will change again.” The Dragon Pulse Realm disciples said with emotions filled in their voices.

“Moon Splitting Skydome? Not bad, but unfortunately… I’m the heaven!” Lin Yun smiled after seeing their sword techniques before gently tossing the ninth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flower, causing it to rise into the sky.

Behind him, thirty-six black figures appeared, each one wielding a sword. Their swords were like brushes that intertwined. After the ancient ‘heaven’ word appeared behind Lin Yun, it flew towards Jin Xuanyi and Ji Shuxuan when he pushed his palm forth.

They were easily knocked back a thousand meters from his palm, and their sword rays also shattered upon contact.

“No! No! No!” Everyone on the Celestial Observing Lake was stumped, unable to accept this.

As Jin Xuanyi and Ji Shuxuan threw out mouthfuls of blood, their clothes were shredded into pieces and their faces had turned red due to the humiliation. This placed them in an awkward position, so they had to jump into the lake and only dared to reveal their heads above the water.

This left the entire Celestial Observing Lake in silence. Both disciples of the Golden Firmament Peak and Scarlet Firmament Peak were crying in their hearts with their faces ugly.

“Senior Brothers, why aren’t you guys coming up?” Lin Yun landed on the lake and looked at the two of them, who only dared to show their heads. He smiled, “Looks like your injuries are too heavy. I’ll help you two get up!”

Lin Yun walked over when he was done speaking, wanting to pull the two out of the lake. But this scared Jin Xuanyi and Ji Shuxuan so much that they wanted to jump out of the lake and stab Lin Yun. “Stop!”

They knew Lin Yun was doing this on purpose, wanting to tease them despite knowing they were naked. But seeing that Lin Yun was approaching, Jin Xuanyi and Ji Shuxuan finally panicked with their faces changed, “We’re convinced! We’re convinced! Junior Brother Lin, we’re fully convinced! We won’t mention anything about you becoming a heaven direct disciple anymore!”

“No, no, no. I still have a long way to go.” Lin Yun smiled as he continued to walk forth.

“Lin Yun, we’re really convinced. You’ll be our senior brother in the future. So please spare us!” Jin Xuanyi and Ji Shuxuan were on the verge of crying, and they even addressed Lin Yun as their senior brother.

Upon hearing that, Lin Yun finally stopped, smiled and said, “Since you both address me as ‘Senior Brother’, I’ll reluctantly accept it. From today onwards, my Divine Firmament Peak will be the leader of the five peaks. So, Junior Brothers, please don’t let me hear about anyone who dares to bully the disciples of my Divine Firmament Peak. Otherwise, don’t blame me for not giving my two dearest junior brothers any respect!”

Jin Xuanyi and Ji Shuxuan’s faces turned black when they heard that. In the future, if the Divine Firmament Peak becomes the leader of the five peaks, wouldn’t the two of them become the sinners of the four peaks?

“Mhm? My dearest junior brothers don’t seem too happy about this. Is there anything wrong with my words? If you two are unconvinced, you can get up and fight me!” Lin Yun smiled.

“We dare not to be unconvinced.” Jin Xuanyi and Ji Shuxuan squeezed out a smile.

“Well then, my Divine Firmament Peak will be the leader of the five peaks in the future. So please keep this in mind, everyone!” Lin Yun smiled as he looked around, but no one dared to directly look at him.

Jin Xuanyi and Ji Shuxuan could only helplessly look up at the sky. They knew they had been thoroughly embarrassed through this battle, which meant that their title as the Twin Stars of the Earth Ranking had also become a joke.

When Lin Yun turned around, he flew back and grasped the ninth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flower.
