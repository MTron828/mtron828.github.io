Chapter 1960 - Unable To Comply! (2)

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint waved her hand and said, “I’ll be talking about the Sword Scripture today. The Sword Ancestor created this. Some of you here might’ve seen it before, and some might not. But it doesn’t matter because the Sword Scripture only has three thousand words, and it’s neither a sword sutra nor a sword technique. But over the years of accumulation, the Sword Scripture has no less than a million words. It’s practically impossible to completely understand it because everyone has their own understanding of it.”

“I’ll start with: What is the sword?” The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint pointed with her finger, and light converged to form a sword hovering in the air. As the sword released a vibrating noise, the sound reverberated throughout the Solar Jade Palace and stumped everyone.

Everyone could only hear a buzzing noise, but it wasn’t unpleasant. Accompanied by Bai Shuying’s zither music, it made everyone feel a warmth in their sword intent located at the center of their brows.

“What is the sword? The sword isn’t a lethal weapon but a sharp weapon. It possesses righteousness, gentleness, and sharpness. The sword can be connected to a swordsman’s spirit and manipulated from a distance away,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said as the sword flew around everyone’s heads, and the saint radiance released by the sword rays captivated everyone’s attention.

“The sword is shadowless and cannot be traced. It can be fine like the rain, it can also be ferocious like a beast, and it can also be unpredictable,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said, and the saint sword created various phenomena in the air along with her words.

The sword became blurred and realistic, accompanied by a violent gale, and a dragon roar could be heard occasionally. Or it would turn into pouring rain, drenching everyone in it.

Lin Yun wiped his face and noticed that it was just ordinary rain. But he couldn’t help wondering how the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint managed to do that.

“Sword!” The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint’s voice suddenly became sharp, and everyone involuntarily straightened their backs after hearing the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint’s roar.

At this moment, it felt like everyone had become a sword in her hand, and she could control them as she wanted.

A star slightly bloomed within the depths of Lin Yun’s brow, and he wasn’t controlled like everyone else. But he didn’t know if it was his misperception, but he seemed to notice the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint batting an eye at him.

Along with a roar, the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint became even more terrifying, and she said, “The sword can slay great qins in the mortal realm, slay demons of hell, and it can also break through heaven…”

A phenomenon appeared before their eyes. As the phenomenon became realistic, it was a one-sided slaughter. The mortal realm was covered with bones and beheaded demons in hell.

“Men have to live together with many things in the world, and that is the same with the sword. One has to temper their mentality to practice the sword, using sword dao as the foundation to step into dao.”

“......”

This naturally wasn’t Bai Shuying’s first time hearing the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint’s lecture. Her zither music fused into the scriptures, becoming one with the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint’s lecture. Her music wasn't inferior, but merged together with the scriptures. This piqued Lin Yun’s interest.

He neglected the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint’s scriptures for a moment and could feel the entire world revolving. The profundity of the music actually complimented the star above his sword sea. In the depths of his forehead, the saint radiance spread throughout his body, which felt comfortable.

“Wonderful!” Lin Yun opened his eyes and clapped his hands together. But his praise instantly disrupted the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint’s lecture.

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint was briefly stunned and unhappy. While everyone else noticed that the voice came from Ye Qingtian, they couldn’t help laughing.

“Haha. Big Brother Qinghong, Ye Qingtian is dead. He actually disrupted the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint’s lecture!” Ye Xin gloated.

Let’s not mention the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint. If anyone disrupted a Saint Lord’s lecture, it would draw the latter’s ire, and they might even make a move out of rage.

Bai Shuying stopped playing the zither, and the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint had no expression on her face. But no one could see her facial features and only saw a rough outline. This was because she was enveloped in a saint radiance, but anyone could vaguely tell that the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint was a peerless beauty.

“Ye Qingtian, how dare you disrupt the martial aunt’s lecture!” The Nether Orchid Courtyard’s Bai Yizhou stood up and roared at Lin Yun. The other Nether Orchid Courtyard’s disciples became furious as they looked at Lin Yun. After all, the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint was the master of the Nether Orchid Courtyard, and she was equivalent to their martial ancestor.

“Ye Qingtian, you’re disrespecting the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint!”

“Who do you think you are to interrupt the lecture? Are you disregarding our martial aunt?!”

Lin Yun gently sighed before the corner of his lips rose into a smile. Just how much hatred did these people have for him?

What he did earlier could be considered serious and insignificant, depending on how you view it. It might become serious if they grabbed onto it and didn’t let him off.

Beside him, Yuan Chen was so nervous that his heart almost leaped out of his chest. But when he saw that Ye Qingtian could still smile, he couldn’t help but be filled with respect for him.

Lin Yun couldn’t be bothered to explain and merely sneered, “The martial aunt hasn’t finished yet, so why are you guys standing up? At the very least, I’m still seated. If you guys say that I’m being disrespectful, you guys should be the ones being more disrespectful!”Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Lin Yun wasn’t a pushover, and he naturally wouldn’t just watch as they threw dirt on his name.

After hearing what Lin Yun said, Bai Yizhou’s face changed. He wanted to turn around and explain, but Lin Yun laughed, “Hahaha, it’s too late! You guys say that I’m being disrespectful, but you guys are the disrespectful ones. Bai Yizhou, not even crippling your cultivation can compensate for your disrespect!”

Bai Yizhou was on the verge of going insane, with his face turning red. He scolded, “You shameless bastard! I’m standing out to reprimand you and not being disrespectful!”

“Wanting to reprimand me on behalf of the martial aunt? The martial aunt is still alive, so who are you to act on behalf of the martial aunt? You’re still saying that you’re not disrespectful?” Lin Yun sneered.

Everyone’s faces changed when they heard that, and even Bai Shuying couldn’t help being alarmed. After all, Ye Qingtian was too ruthless with his words.

“Sit down,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said. She didn’t reprimand Bai Yizhou, but looked at Lin Yun before asking, “Combining Yin and Yang, nurturing an indigo-glazed and untainted heart.”

Lin Yun’s mind was filled with question marks when he heard that.

“What’s wonderful about it? If you can't explain it, you can get lost,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said.

Bai Yizhou, Xiao Jingyan, Ye Qinghong, and Zhang Kui wore gloating smiles. This was the most challenging part of the scripture, and there were multiple explanations. But finding an answer that could satisfy the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint was practically impossible.

The surroundings fell silent as they looked at Ye Qingtian, including Bai Shuying and the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint.

“I don’t know,” Lin Yun replied. He didn’t even listen to the second part of the scripture and naturally didn’t know what it meant. It wasn’t because he didn’t want to come up with something, but he truly didn’t know.

Raising his head, Lin Yun said, “I only heard the first half of it before my attention was shifted to the holy maiden’s music. When I said wonderful, I didn’t mean the martial aunt’s explanation but the holy maiden’s music. I don’t know anything about the Sword Scripture, but I know about music. I don't mind leaving if I can’t praise music in the Solar Jade Palace. I’m the Dragon Origin Great Saint’s secluded disciple. If you want me to get lost because of a single praise, you’ll have to ask my master if he agrees. Even if he’s willing, I’m not. So I apologize for being unable to comply!”

Everyone’s minds blew apart when they heard that, and they were all dumbfounded with their scalps going numb.
