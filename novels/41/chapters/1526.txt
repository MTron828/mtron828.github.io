Chapter 1527 - Showing Off His Might

Everyone from the seven demonic sects was stumped when they heard what Lin Yun said. Even the Samsara Edict Realm elders from the various sects had fear flashing across their pupils. The Sword Sect might have declined now, but there wasn’t a single person in the Eastern Desolation that hadn’t heard of the Radiant Sword Saint’s name.

Just the fact that he was one of the three Sword Saints in the Eastern Desolation was enough to speak for his strength. Only three people in the Eastern Desolation dared to use the word ‘Sword’ in their title. This might seem like a simple title, but it proved their strength through the lives of many. There were many swordsmen from the Saints, but not every swordsman could be called a Sword Saint.

The title was the glory and proof of their strength. Being a Sword Saint was an immense glory in this world, and anyone who wasn’t strong enough with that title would be long dragged down. So Lin Yun’s words were equivalent to dropping a bomb in the asteroid belt, leaving everyone shocked.

A long time later, an uproar exploded and everyone’s gazes were filled with shock when they looked at Lin Yun. “He’s the disciple of the Radiant Sword Saint?”

“I thought the Radiant Sword Saint was no longer taking in disciples? He even rejected Xiahou Yan, who possesses the Innate Sword Physique and Innate Sword Heart.”

“I heard that he did take in a disciple. Don’t tell me that he’s the one?”

“It makes sense, if it’s really him. Not to mention that he’s managed to last till the end.”

Since the activity of the seven demonic sects wasn’t mainly in the Ancient Barren Domain, they weren’t that well-informed in regards to this information. So they were shocked and puzzled when they heard what Lin Yun said. But if Lin Yun was really the disciple of the Radiant Sword Saint, it would be hard to resolve this matter today.

Not to mention what others think, even the five chief disciples in front of Lin Yun had shock on their faces. Lin Yun was the disciple of the Radiant Sword Saint? No one would dare to touch him today if he really was the disciple of the Radiant Sword Saint.

Their faces were ugly, with reluctance on their faces, but none of them dared to make a move. The arrogance they had before had now disappeared.

“Hmph. Don’t bullshit. You think I don’t know that he’s in seclusion?” A cold voice resounded from Qiu Qiong of the Netherworld Hall. “Hand over the Blue Dragon Bone, and I can give the Radiant Sword Saint face by sparing you. Otherwise, what can you do even if I bully you? A mere disciple of the Sword Sect dares to challenge the seven demonic sects?”

He was an arrogant person, to begin with. When he said those words, his temperament became even more domineering. The Samsara Edict Realm elders from the other demonic sects were all startled by Qiu Qiong’s words. They knew that Qiu Qiong was fearless, and they had personally experienced it today.

They had experienced how arrogant Qiu Qiong was today. He did not even give the Radiant Sword Saint any face. But when they thought about it again, what Qiu Qiong said wasn’t exactly wrong. It had been a long time since the Radiant Sword Saint showed himself, and Tian Xuanzi stole all the limelight in the Ancient Barren Domain.

“Murong Chen, go for it. The Radiant Sword Saint still can’t put his hands on the seven demonic sects!” Qiu Qiong coldly said.

“Roger that, hahaha!” Murong Chen laughed. With Qiu Qiong backing him up, he naturally didn’t have to fear the Radiant Sword Saint. Before Lin Yun could say a word, Murong Chen drew his demonic blade and charged over.

“Lin Tian, today is your death, and not even the Radiant Sword Saint can save you!” Murong Chen indifferently said. Before he charged over, a painting that covered half the sky unfolded behind him. His blade ray surged with a torrential demonic aura that made him look like a demonic dragon when paired with his cultivation at the Dragon Pulse Realm.

Why do I fear death as long as I have my sword in my hand? Lin Yun inwardly said the moment he grabbed onto the Flower Burial Sword. Raising his brow, he drew his sword and executed the first sword of the Earth Sword Form empowered by his pinnacle Firmamanet Sword Intent and destroyed the blade ray unleashed by Murong Chen.

“Looks like you’ve improved. But you’ll still die!” Murong Chen grinned. When he shook his wrist, he unleashed eighty-one blades in a breath. Each blade ray manifested into a demonic dragon that was enveloped with a crimson demonic aura. The demonic aura was filled with dense resentment, making the surroundings look like hell.

When Lin Yun executed the second sword of the Earth Sword Form, the Flower Burial Sword began to flicker with a cold and dark light. With a gentle brush, Lin Yun swung his sword out, and a boundless sword aura exploded. The sword ray was like a brush that landed on the demonic dragon.𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

When the demonic dragon shattered, Murong Chen was surprised because his attack was actually resolved so easily by Lin Yun. He began to wonder what sword technique that was because he never saw Lin Yun executing that before.

Lin Yun’s sword intent had reached a terrifying height when wielding the Flower Burial Sword. The aloofness in his sword intent was like a red flower in the snow. He wouldn’t provoke others on purpose. But if anyone tried to provoke him, he would return it ten-fold.

While gently tapping his foot on the ground, a carefree intent soared from Lin Yun, emitting a dazzling pride that no one could neglect. Facing his attack, Murong Chen actually failed to dodge it and took a sword on his right shoulder.

“Is this all? You don’t look so impressive after all, even after you’ve reached the Dragon Pulse Realm.” Lin Yun said when he landed on the ground.

“How is this possible?!” Qin Yue, Pei An, Chen Kui, and Yan Xuan were dumbfounded when they saw this scene. They couldn’t believe that Murong Chen was injured with three swords after his breakthrough into the Dragon Pulse Realm.

When the four exchanged glances, they reached an agreement and stood beside Murong Chen, drawing their weapons. They had no intention of letting Lin Yun off, to begin with. They were only concerned about Lin Yun’s identity. But they no longer had reservations since Murong Chen made the first move.

“Don’t go easy on him. His sword technique is weird, and I suspect he has refined the Blue Dragon Bone!” Murong Chen coldly said while looking at the wound on his right shoulder. That sword from earlier was weird, and he was fortunate because he was fast enough to avoid it. Otherwise, the consequences would’ve been dire.

“Let’s go at him together. We can discuss who will have the Blue Dragon Bone afterwards. As for his other treasures, we can split it amongst ourselves!” Chen Kui said. Aside from the Blue Dragon Bone, there was no doubt that Lin Yun definitely obtained other treasures in the trial tower. No matter what, they couldn’t allow him to leave, even if he was the disciple of the Radiant Sword Saint.

“I have no objection to that!” Yan Xuan licked his lips and revealed a sinister smile.

“I hope that you guys won’t regret it, then!” Lin Yun’s gaze was cold as he tightened his grip on the Flower Burial Sword. As if the sword had sensed his killing intent, it began to incessantly vibrate. Before the five made a move, he had already charged into the asteroid belt with his sword. He had decided to start a massacre, killing anyone who dared to stand in his way.

“You’re courting death!” When the five saw Lin Yun charging over, their eyes flashed with mockery. But their smiles lasted for only a split second because Lin Yun suddenly disappeared. More accurately speaking, Lin Yun’s sword aura had disappeared. His sword intent was like the clouds, giving off a feeling that it didn’t exist, yet it was everywhere.

“What’s going on?” Just when everyone felt uneasy and became alert, they pushed their astral energy to the limit. Suddenly, a sword vibration echoed, and a sword ray appeared. When Lin Yun reappeared, he was behind Chen Kui, thrusting his sword.

Chen Kui didn’t have the time to think as he turned around and raised his demonic blade. When the blade and sword collided, astral energy fluctuated, which caught Chen Kui by surprise because he had difficulty firmly wielding his sword.

“Let me deal with him!” A cold light flashed across Murong Chen’s pupils as he appeared before Lin Yun, thrust his blade.

“Together!” The remaining three were building up their attacks, and they charged forth, drawing their various weapons. As a terrifying aura exploded, it caused the entire heaven and earth to start trembling.

Murong Chen’s blade blocked Lin Yun’s sword. Sparks flew when the blade tip and sword tip collided. As Murong Chen let out a roar, he pushed his cultivation at the first-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm to the limit.

Under that immense pressure, the Flower Burial Sword began to bend as Murong Chen slowly approached.

“Die!”

When Chen Kui and the three others saw this scene, a cold light flashed across their pupils, and they charged over from different directions. This was an excellent opportunity because Murong Chen and Lin Yun couldn’t escape their stalemate. So this instantly placed Lin Yun in a dangerous position.

A ‘heaven’ word appeared in Lin Yun’s palm right then. It began to overlap as thirty-six sword rays bloomed over Lin Yun’s palm. When the thirty-six sword rays overlapped, Lin Yun threw it out at Murong Chen, causing the latter to throw out a mouthful of blood before he was sent flying away.

After sending Murong Chen flying, Lin Yun didn’t even glance at the four charging over and swung his sword. The Flower Burial Sword was like a brush, with each swing creating a painting that sent the four flying back.

When Lin Yun clasped his hands together, the Golden Crow Wings opened up behind him while he grabbed onto the Flower Burial Sword. When he held onto the Flower Burial Sword, space overlapped, and Lin Yun suddenly appeared before Murong Chen.

“Screw you!” A ruthless light flashed across Murong Chen’s pupils as a pair of crimson and silver wings opened up behind him. When the pair of wings unfolded, they were instantly sliced into two by Lin Yun’s Golden Crow Wings, causing Murong Chen to let out a wail.

But Lin Yun didn’t want to give Murong Chen a chance to catch his breath and executed the Earth Sword Form. Whenever he swung his sword, the surrounding space would become heavy. Thirty-six sword rays later, the space suddenly became so heavy that it made Murong Chen’s legs feel like two boulders.

Even Chen Kui and the other three felt like they had fallen into quicksand with their movements greatly restricted. This left everyone from the seven demonic sects dumbfounded because Lin Yun suppressed five Dragon Pulse Realm experts by himself!
