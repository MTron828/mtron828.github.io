Chapter 1232 - Invincible Sword Aura

When Lin Yun drew his sword, the black cobwebs swiftly crawled over the surface of his skin like centipedes that were about to devour his head.

When the audience saw Lin Yun’s face, they took a deep breath. Despite his sword ray being so beautiful, his face was terribly ugly, as if he was about to die. Plus, beneath his skin were countless poisonous worms that were charging toward Lin Yun’s heart.

His sword intent was too strong, which nurtured the Bloodborne Poison. However, Lin Yun still drew his sword with countless Azure Birds flying out of his body at the crimson moon.

“Demonic Blood Dragon!” At the same time, Xiahou Jue executed his strongest attack. His indifferent voice was chilly as he watched the colossal Demonic Blood Dragon pounce towards Lin Yun. The demonic dragon was covered in bizarre spiritual runes and its scales were enveloped in black demonic miasma that brought the aura of death to the stage.

“I’m impressed that you can force me to use this move!” Xiahou Jue’s face became pale after using this attack. When the demonic dragon charged forward, everything in its path became distorted with cracks spreading out on the ground.

Everyone could tell that Xiahou Jue was serious and was trying to end the battle. He even executed his trump card after being beaten up by Lin Yun. After all, Xiahou Jue had no idea how many trump cards Lin Yun had left. Since he could feel that Lin Yun was dangerous, he wouldn’t let Lin Yun gain an advantage with the sword.

Lin Yun swung his sword at the crimson moon while the dragon charged at him. At this moment, he didn’t put up any defenses as the poison swiftly spread throughout his body.

The audience silently watched Lin Yun, and couldn’t understand what he was doing. His obsession to use his sword made no sense since it was killing him.

In the next second, Lin Yun’s sword ray sliced the crimson moon in half like a watermelon. Countless crimson raindrops fell down from the sky and a bizarre scene occurred. When the crimson moon exploded, a massive and ugly black moth appeared before everyone, scattering invisible powder as it flapped its wings.

When the powder came in contact with the astral energy in the surroundings, it swiftly fused with the astral energy, allowing the poison to spread.

“What the heck is that? It’s so disgusting!”

“How terrifying. It’s poison is everywhere.”

“It’s the Heavenly Demon Moth!”

“This is too vicious. The Crimson Moon Elysium is too despicable!” Exclamations resounded around the plaza with everyone having disbelief on their faces.

Then, Lin Yun’s sword intent containing a quasi-divine firmament sword intent swept through the moth, immediately killing it.

Without the moth, the powder in the air fell to the earth like dust. At the same time, the black marks on Lin Yun’s face swiftly receded and the poison within his body was eradicated by the astral energy in his body.

“This is the end!” Xiahou Jue wasn’t surprised because he had guessed that Lin Yun would aim for the crimson moon. But so what? He had already executed his strongest attack and he didn’t think that Lin Yun could take this attack head-on.

The demonic dragon swiftly tore through the Azure Birds that guarded Lin Yun. Then, it coiled around him, causing cracks to spread out on the ground. Looking at this scene, all the disciples of the Crimson Moon Elysium let out a breath of relief. Without knowing, their foreheads were drenched in sweat.

They didn’t think that Lin Yun could take the attack head-on, even if he had a powerful physique or sword attacks. At the very least, Lin Yun would be incapable of fighting anymore.

As Xiahou Jue let out a sigh, exhaustion appeared on his face. Unleashing the demonic dragon was taxing, but the outcome was great. Regardless of the Divine Dragon Baptism or Sword Saint Mountain’s secret, it could benefit him greatly so that he would have more trump cards to become a holy son. He was especially pleased because the Sword Saint Mountain was said to contain the secrets behind the huge change three millennia ago.

The Divine Dragon Baptism was something that only those who had contributed greatly to the Divine Dragon Empire could receive. With the baptism, his foundation in the quasi-Elysium Core Realm would increase twofold.

So once he reached the Elysium Core Realm, he would get a spot on the Elysium Core Ranking.

But when he didn’t hear anyone announce his victory, he locked his brows together and barked, “The battle has already come to an end. What are you waiting for? Are you people from the Profound Azure Prefecture idiots?”

“Relax. We all sense that Lin Yun hasn’t died…” Several elders of the Profound Azure Prefecture said.

“Not dead?” Xiahou Jue snickered. “Of course he isn’t dead. But so what? Do you think he can still put up a fight? Just get it over with and announce my victory. Otherwise, I’ll be forced to slaughter that brat!”

The elders of the Profound Azure Prefecture’s faces became ugly and they had no idea how to resolve this issue. The elders started to discuss their thoughts and came to an agreement that there wasn’t an issue in announcing Xiahou Jue’s victory. No matter how they looked at it, they didn’t think that Lin Yun could still put up a fight.

But just when they were about to announce the result, a sword ray tore through the rubble. Shortly after, an azure figure slowly walked out of the cloud of dust with his sword box on his back. Lin Yun was covered in blood and most of the purple-golden dragon runes on the surface of his body had shattered. It looked like he would topple over with a small shove.

But when he raised his head, Lin Yun smiled. “Xiahou Jue, you want to announce your victory when I can still hold onto my sword?”

When Lin Yun finished, a boundless sword aura exploded out of him and soared into the horizon. This was Lin Yun’s sword aura that had been suppressed since the start of the battle.

The audience was shocked by this scene because they didn’t think that Lin Yun could survive Xiahou Jue’s attack. Furthermore, they could sense that Lin Yun’s sword aura had changed. Lin Yun clearly looked like he would fall, but he seemed like an immovable mountain when he held onto his sword. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“You…” Xiahou Jue looked at Lin Yun emotionlessly.

“Don’t think that you’re invincible just because you’re holding onto a sword. I defeated you once, I can naturally defeat you again! Blood Demonic Dragon!” Xiahou Jue roared, summoning the Blood Demonic Dragon once more. He damaged his foundation to unleash this attack, but he didn’t care.

Without the support of the crimson moon, this attack seemed somewhat lacking and wasn’t as ferocious as before.

“Futile!” Lin Yun wielded his sword and took a deep breath before swinging his sword. “Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords—Myriad Sword Condensation!”

When Lin Yun swung his sword, 13 Azure Birds fused into a gigantic azure sword that shone like the sun. At the same time, everyone could sense a dangerous aura coming from the azure sword. Instinctively, no one dared to look directly at the sword.

Facing the azure sword, the demonic dragon swiftly dissolved before turning into a puddle of blood on the ground.

“Xiahou Jue, you lost.” Lin Yun raised his head emotionlessly to look at Xiahou Jue. At this moment, his face was pale and his hand was trembling with blood dripping down from his palm. Lin Yun had also reached his limit after bringing out the genuine holy spirit of the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords.

“Impossible!” Xiahou Jue’s eyes flashed with violence as he charged toward Lin Yun.

“Such impudence!” Lin Yun snorted and the golden aura enveloping his sword cocoon ignited. Light came from his forehead that instantly suppressed Xiahou Jue.

It was as if an invisible hand was holding Xiahou Jue back. Then, Xiahou Jue slammed into the ground. No matter how much he struggled, he was forced to kneel before Lin Yun.
