Chapter 364 - Beating Three in One Sword

Lin Yun rushed over, intending to find his fellow disciples, so he made his move when he saw that Chen Xuanjun was in danger. After sending Zhang Yan back, Lin Yun arrived in front of Chen Xuanjun with the Seven Profound Steps.

“Lin Yun?” The three core disciples were all shocked before they rejoiced with killing intent brimming in their eyes.

“Junior Brother, leave! They’re here for you!” yelled Chen Xuanjun.

Lin Yun thought about Chen Xuanjun’s words. Here for me?

“Why bother leaving when you’re already here?” Zhao Quan smiled, “It looks like your harvest in the Demonlotus Realm wasn’t bad. You’re truly worthy of being called a monstrous genius to make a breakthrough in just barely one month.”

“It looks like we can’t let him live any longer. God knows how far he’ll reach when he leaves the Demonlotus Realm.”

“Attack!” ordered Zhang Yan.

Zhao Quan and Xiao Ming both laughed before they summoned their dracophant energy.

“Die!” The two threw a punch in Lin Yun’s direction, which was accompanied by saintly music. Their physical strength and origin energy had perfectly fused in their attacks.

“Watch out…” cried Chen Xuanjun.

“Pitiful tricks,” muttered Lin Yun. The three might be in the ninth stage, but they weren’t as strong as Feng Ye. He could fight Feng Ye back when he was in the seventh stage. So he naturally had nothing to fear since he made a breakthrough.

Lin Yun didn’t even bother using the Flower Burial Sword and threw out a punch. His dracophant energy had a hint of crimson in it, which signified that it was more violent than Zhao Quan and Xiao Ming’s dracophant energy.

When the fists collided, it was like two ancient beasts were clashing together. Zhao Quan and Xiao Ming were shocked that they failed to suppress Lin Yun, even with the two of them combined.

“Dracophant Battle Physique in the fourth stage?” Zhang Yan frowned at this. There were barely any disciples who could reach the fourth stage in the Dracophant Battle Physique in the Primal Origin Sect, so how could an outsider manage to accomplish this?

In the blink of an eye, the three of them exchanged more than ten moves, with Lin Yun evenly matched with Zhao Quan and Xiao Ming.

“Is that all you guys got?” Lin Yun said with disdain in his eyes.

“What arrogance!” they shouted.

Both Zhao Quan and Xiao Ming felt embarrassed. After all, there were so many people witnessing this fight. The contempt in Lin Yun’s eyes only made it worse for them.

Their dracophant energy blazed furiously as they threw their punches at Lin Yun. But when their punches fell on Lin Yun, they were shocked to discover a purple armour around Lin Yun. Their attacks couldn’t even injure Lin Yun. Just when the two were shocked, a roar echoed from Lin Yun’s body, sending them both flying away.

Lin Yun dashed over with a tiger manifesting behind him. He was executing the Hundred Beast Wave. When the tiger opened its eyes, Lin Yun threw out a punch that sent Zhao Quan and Xiao Ming flying away once again.

“Die!” Zhang Yan took advantage of the break to throw out a punch at Lin Yun. His dracophant energy blazed and enveloped Lin Yun. It looked as if even the clouds were about to burn.

The momentum behind this punch was too great and it attracted everyone’s attention. But before anyone could react, the Flower Burial Sword buzzed and flew into the flames.

The torrential sword aura shined like a bright moon that instantly crushed the blazing dracophant energy. After all, how could a firefly compete with the moon?

The instant the sea of flames engulfed Lin Yun, it was destroyed by Lin Yun’s sword aura. Even though Zhang Yan had retreated quickly, he still took a strike to the chest that drenched his clothes in blood.

“Senior Brother!” Zhao Quan and Xiao Ming both stepped forth.

“I’m fine.” Zhang Yan gnashed his teeth and looked at Lin Yun. Lin Yun was carrying a sword box behind him as the Flower Burial Sword rested on the ground beside him. He was looking at them coldly with both hands behind his back.

Zhang Yan instantly knew that they had to use their trump cards to kill Lin Yun. There was also no way they could get to Chen Xuanjun without getting through Lin Yun.

Lin Yun waved his hand and started pouring his quasi-xiantian sword intent into the sword. This made everyone’s swords buzz.

Everyone quickly held onto their swords with doubt reflecting in their eyes. They had no idea what Lin Yun was trying to do right now. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The three Primal Origin Sect’s core disciples also frowned their eyebrows. But all of a sudden, Lin Yun roared and swung his sword at the three of them.

It only took an instant for the sword to reach Zhang Yan, Zhao Quan, and Xiao Ming. The three were shocked and retaliated instantaneously. But they soon cried out bitterly in their hearts. The sword pushed the three of them back before Zhang Yan managed to knock the sword back.

“The three of you can try and cross this sword,” said Lin Yun.

Zhang Yan, Zhao Quan, and Xiao Ming’s faces were ugly. They felt humiliated that a junior was actually threatening the three of them. Their hearts couldn’t help but shiver when they looked at the Flower Burial Sword buzzing on the ground. They didn’t dare to look down on Lin Yun after experiencing the previous attack.

“How terrifying… A new talent from the Sword Firmament Pavilion actually forced three core disciples from the Primal Origin Sect back…”

“That’s Lin Yun, right? He rose to fame back at the Princess Manor, but I never expected that he would grow so quickly.”

“Maybe he got lucky in the Demonlotus Realm.” The abrupt change to the situation exceeded everyone’s expectations. Lin Yun knocked the three of them back with one sword and also intimidated them with his words.

Breaking the silence, several people rushed over. They were either disciples of the Sword Firmament Pavilion or the Primal Origin Sect. Despite having reinforcements, Zhang Yan, Zhao Quan, and Xiao Ming’s faces were unsightly because they felt embarrassed by Lin Yun.

“Let’s go!” Zhang Yan left with the disciples of the Primal Origin Sect before the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s disciples could gather together.

“Senior Brother Chen, what happened?” The faces of Xin Yan, Tang Tong, and everyone else changed when they saw Chen Xuanjun’s injuries.

“Senior Brother Chen must have saved junior brother from those bastards.” Tang Tong gave out a logical analysis.

But Chen Xuanjun smiled bitterly, “That’s not what happened. The three wanted to kill me and junior brother saved my life.”

“What?” Xin Yan and everyone’s faces changed. Then, Lin Yun walked over after he sheathing his sword.

Everyone then turned to look at Lin Yun with shock. They had no idea when Lin Yun became powerful enough to save Chen Xuanjun from the hands of three core disciples from the Primal Origin Sect.
