Chapter 1159 - Flower

Lin Yun had survived the battle with Lei Ying who was a quasi-Elysium Core Realm genius. It was the most dangerous battle he had experienced since coming to Kunlun Realm. However, he was the ultimate winner.

Looking at the crimson dusk, Lin Yun poured out all of his emotions into the flute. By the time he was done playing, the sun had completely disappeared from the sky. Just like that, the two of them sat in front of a bonfire, with a mood that was different from before.

“I take back my words from before. Your ability to play the flute isn’t inferior to Flower Burial.” When Ye Ziling looked at Lin Yun once more, her expression became gentler. Her opinion of Lin Yun was different, especially after hearing that he considered himself a disciple of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect.

“Not bad, I guess…” Lin Yun smiled.

As the breeze blew from the ocean, Ye Ziling wore a complicated gaze. “I’m surprised that you came back for me. I know I haven’t treated you the best after you joined the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect.”

Putting the jade flute away, Lin Yun casually threw a few more dried tree branches into the bonfire. Then, he told Ye Ziling what Feng Zhang and the others said when they were running.

“How are they now?” Ye Ziling asked.

“They should be at the campsite by now. I told them not to come out, so there shouldn’t be anything big,” replied Lin Yun. He believed that Liu Yuan could make everyone listen to him with his prestige.

“But you shouldn’t have come. You should know that Lei Ying isn’t an ordinary demonic cultivator. Plus, there’s no way you can fight him. Even if he was heavily injured, you and I still don’t stand a chance,” said Ye Ziling.

“But aren’t I still here in the end?” Lin Yun took out the jar of Millennium Flame from his interspatial pouch and took a sip.

Ye Ziling was furious for a brief moment when she heard that before she smiled, accepting what Lin Yun said. “Well, it’ll be weird if you didn’t come knowing that temper of yours. Your pride wouldn’t allow you to accept my sacrifice.”

“I’ll be honest with you, you’re pretty when you smile,” said Lin Yun after seeing Ye Ziling’s smile that could melt an ice mountain.

“I… can’t smile.” Ye Ziling sighed. “The next ranking battle will be hosted soon in the Profound Azure Prefecture, and the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s name will be removed in the Profound Azure Prefecture if we can’t make it into the top three.”

“Ranking battle? Removed?” Lin Yun heard bits and pieces about the ranking battle because of Wang Yuruo. But he felt that it had nothing to do with him because he didn’t feel like a part of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect.

“The ranking battle is held every decade to determine a sect’s territory and resources. Decades ago, the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect was still very strong, but it has declined ever since my father came…” Mentioning the sect master, Ye Ziling couldn’t help sounding disappointed. “My father was a genius in the Ancient Barren Domain, but he suffered a huge setback in the past that caused him to shut himself from the outside world. The decline of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect has a lot to do with him…”

When Lin Yun heard that, his face changed because he never expected to hear such a story. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“He was a prideful person back then. He might not place what others said in his eyes, but I do! I can’t allow the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s name to be removed from the Profound Azure Prefecture!” Ye Ziling said firmly.

After hearing all of Ye Ziling’s explanations, Lin Yun realized that the ranking battle wasn’t as simple as he had imagined. It turned out that the four major sects all had a powerful sect backing them up. The Profound Azure Prefecture might seem insignificant, but there were resources here.

After the ranking battle, there will only be three sects allowed to remain in the Profound Azure Prefecture. It had something to do with the power struggle between the powerful sects and the Divine Dragon Empire. If it was possible, the Profound Azure Prefecture wouldn’t even tolerate the existence of any powerful sects.

Although it was impossible for them to expel everyone at once, they could tighten their control slowly. In the past, there were ten sects that shared the resources in the Profound Azure Prefecture. But after this year, only three would remain.

“But since you’ve reached the Astral Stage, it shouldn’t be difficult for you to keep the sect in the top three,” said Lin Yun. He could sense that the current Ye Ziling was a lot stronger.

“I’m being restricted in a lot of ways. My bloodline isn’t compatible with the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords, not to mention that this sword technique isn’t complete. On the other hand, the Suspend King Palace’s Chu Tianhao has cultivated his sect’s technique to the highest level,” said Ye Ziling while she lowered her head.

Looking at her, Lin Yun also fell silent because he never expected that she would have so much pressure.

“Let’s stop talking about me. Why don’t we talk about you? You’re the champion of the Ninth Heavenly Path. I’m curious what kind of treasured place it was.” Ye Ziling smiled.

“Treasured place?” Lin Yun smiled and looked at Ye Ziling for a long time before he smiled bitterly, “It isn’t a treasured place. Although we’re all geniuses from the various realms, we’re no different from pitiful bugs struggling for a better stage. We all experienced life and death just so that we can have the same starting point as everyone in Kunlun Realm. But we know that the majority of us won’t make it far in Kunlun Realm.”

Lin Yun took another sip of wine before he sighed, “The Ninth Heavenly Path was a little more brutal because of the ten Realm Sons. Those bastards completely disregarded everyone else in their eyes and slaughtered countless people.”

“I’m sorry to hear that.” Ye Ziling didn’t expect the Heavenly Path to be so brutal. She was finally starting to understand what Lin Yun experienced on the Heavenly Path.

“It doesn’t matter since they’re all basically dead now…” Lin Yun grinned while taking another sip of wine.

Basically dead… Ye Ziling raised her head to look at Lin Yun’s pure smile, but she could imagine what kind of purgatory Lin Yun climbed out of.

“There’s no need to apologize. It’s a fact that we’re of lowly birth. But even an ant has the right to look at the sky. I don’t need anyone else to take pity on me because I’m the seed of the Profound Amber Realm, the champion of the Ninth Heavenly Path! I bear the hope of many people, and I will continue to press on until I reach the summit of Kunlun!” Lin Yun laughed.

But when Ye Ziling heard that, she was completely stunned because she never expected that Lin Yun would be so arrogant. A long time later, Ye Ziling said, “Looks like my first impression of you is right. You’re arrogant!”

“Hahaha!” Lin Yun laughed when he heard that. “Don’t tell me that we’re any different. Come, have some wine!”

“I don’t think so.” Ye Ziling frowned. She had never touched wine and didn’t want to even though she knew that the wine Lin Yun offered her was the Millennium Flame.

“Drink! Drink and I’ll teach you the last three swords of the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords!” Lin Yun didn’t give up and persuaded her to drink.

“I…” Ye Ziling was suddenly at a loss because she never expected that Lin Yun would be willing to teach her the last three swords of the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords.

“Go on!” Lin Yun poured a cup of wine as the sparks from the wine manifested into a golden crow that circled around them.

Ye Ziling looked at the wine and carefully took a sip. However, she was immediately choked by the burning sensation of the wine.

Looking at her, Lin Yun couldn’t help laughing, “Haha! I didn’t expect that Lady Ye, who isn’t even afraid of Lei Ying, would be afraid of drinking wine!”

“Who says that I’m afraid?!” Ye Ziling drank the entire cup of wine when she heard Lin Yun’s words. Immediately, the alcohol turned her cheeks red, making her look even more charming than usual.

“Watch carefully.” Lin Yun smiled before he grabbed onto the Flower Burial Sword and began to perform the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords. Although he had yet to reach the manifestation stage in the last three swords, it was more than enough for him to teach Ye Ziling.

“Clouds beyond the azure mountain with the emerald stars shining behind! Fleeting clouds isn’t my intention and a myriad year with a flick of my finger!” Lin Yun didn’t just perform but he even told Ye Ziling the meaning behind each sword, completely captivating Ye Ziling’s attention. Furthermore, Ye Ziling could see the boundless sword intent manifested by Lin Yun.

She suddenly realized that she had it all wrong. Even if she relied on her bloodline to forcibly reach complete mastery in the first ten swords, she had only touched the fleeting clouds. She was still beneath the clouds. Once she realized this, her bottleneck started to loosen up. Without any hesitation, Ye Ziling immediately shut her eyes to comprehend the profundity of the swords.

When Lin Yun was done, he returned the Flower Burial Sword to its sheath. Looking at Ye Ziling, who was glowing with purple snow flowers on her body, he couldn’t help feeling surprised, “Radiant Snow Flowers?”

Lin Yun could tell that Ye Ziling had many secrets. Because of the Flower Burial Sword, Lin Yun was pretty knowledgeable when it came to spiritual flowers. If he remembered correctly, the Radiant Snow Flower was ranked as a top ten flower and could only be found on snowy terrains. It was also called a saint flower.

Since she had a different surname from the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s sect master, she might really have some secrets about her. Then again, it had nothing to do with him, so he laughed it off.

Since the elders were arriving tomorrow, Lin Yun had to find a way to deal with them. This made Lin Yun vexed as he wondered if he should tell them that he refined the origin stone unconsciously.
