Chapter 1116 - Luo Hua

Lin Yun had long arrived in the Main Palace waiting for the sect master. This old geezer was still as unfathomable as in the past and his sword intent became even more terrifying than even Lin Yun couldn’t see through with his sword intent.

During this period of time, Lin Yun had a clear understanding of the cultivation in Kunlun Realm. A Dragon Pulse Realm expert was a powerhouse no matter where they were placed, and it wasn’t that easy to reach either. After all, each pulse would allow the cultivator to undergo a transformation.

The Profound Azure Manor wasn’t small even if it was just a small territory in the Eastern Desolation. In terms of size, it was even bigger than the Profound Amber Realm. The number of Dragon Pulse Realm experts in the Profound Azure Manor wouldn’t exceed the number of fingers in two hands.

Most elders in the four major sects in the Profound Azure Manor were all Elysium Core Realm experts, and the Dragon Pulse Realm meant equivalent position with the sect masters and could easily obtain a territory for themselves in the Profound Azure Manor to open their own sects if they wanted.

So it was weird for Lin Yun that the sect master’s sword intent would be so strong when he had such strong cultivation. He had a feeling that even ordinary experts in the ninth pulse also wouldn’t be able to put up a fight before the sect master. This made Lin Yun curious why someone like the sect master who could have a position in the Eastern Desolation would stay in a small place like the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect silently.

“You’re really patient. If I don’t look for you, you’re not going to find me? It has been nearly two months since you joined the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, right? You haven’t even come to pay me a visit once…” The sect master smiled.

The reason why Lin Yun didn’t want to come was that the sect master was too mysterious and fishy. But it looks like he wouldn’t be able to avoid meeting the sect master now.

“Old geezer, why did you look for me?” Lin Yun smiled.

The sect master didn’t care about Lin Yun’s rudeness and smiled, “There’s naturally a reason why I look for you. It has nearly been two months, and you’ve just reached the seventh soul Heavenly Soul Realm. I’m afraid that I won’t be able to give Feng Jue an explanation one year from now…”

Lin Yun was from the lower realm. Unlike the other geniuses in Kunlun Realm, Lin Yun clearly hadn’t excavated all his potential. Logically speaking, Lin Yun should be an empyrean by now since he had ascended the Sword Saint Mountain.

This made Lin Yun’s eyes flicker because the old geezer should be able to tell that he was trying to reach the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm. But Lin Yun didn’t explain and waited for the sect master to continue.

“It’s not that easy to reach the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm. Even if you have enough accumulation, it’s another issue if your physique can tough through it. I believe you must have exhausted most of your True Dragon Saint Liquid, right?” The sect master smoked with his eyes squinted, seeing through all of Lin Yun’s secrets.

Lin Yun’s heart sank when he heard that because he had almost used up all his True Dragon Saint Liquid now, and the Azure Dragon Saint Art was still stuck in the fourth stage. He had been making swift progress in his sword technique, sword sutra, and cultivation. But the progression of his physique was slow, and his progress was no different from stagnant.

“You have more True Dragon Saint Liquid?” Lin Yun’s eyes flickered and immediately regretted the moment he spoke out. It would be weird if the sect master didn’t have any with his cultivation. Not only did he waste his saliva asking, but he even revealed the fact that he needed more True Dragon Saint Liquid.

The sect master didn’t say a word and took out a scroll instead, “Five droplets of True Dragon Saint Liquid for a person and twenty-five droplets for the first name.”

When Lin Yun took the scroll over, he took a cold breath because they were all empyrean demonic cultivators, and the first name was even in the Galaxy Stage. This meant that this person was even stronger than most core disciples in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“You’re making it difficult for me,” said Lin Yun in a salty tone after glancing at the sect master. He was only in the seventh soul Heavenly Soul Realm. Although it wouldn’t be an issue for him to face ordinary Star Stage experts, demonic cultivators weren’t normal, and they were at least comparable to the core disciples. As for the first name, he was probably stronger than most core disciples aside from Ye Ziling.

So one could imagine how tough it would be to kill him. After all, defeating and killing someone wasn’t on the same level of difficulty. Take Lin Yun as an example, there was no way he could put up a fight against Ye Ziling, but he was also confident that Ye Ziling wouldn’t be able to kill him. Not to mention that demonic cultivators were brutal and cunning, so they naturally have powerful trump cards.

“So are you going to accept it?” The sect master asked, ignoring Lin Yun’s grumble.

“That’s for sure.” Lin Yun didn’t have any reason to refuse and kept the scroll carefully.

“Remember that you either don’t move or kill them altogether. Otherwise, you won’t be able to get any True Dragon Saint Liquid if you let one of them escape,” smiled the sect master.

Hearing that, Lin Yun’s lips twitched, and kept the scroll before he smiled bitterly, “Old geezer, you’re no longer making it difficult for me but want me dead instead.”

This old geezer had been giving him pressure since he came to the sect, and now, he wanted to kill him.

The sect master stroked his beard and smiled, “Brat, you don’t know what’s good for you. You have no idea how terrifying it is to make it to the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm. Don’t think that you’ll succeed relying on the Nine-Leaf Saint Fruit. Even if you slew everyone on the scroll, the amount of True Dragon Saint Liquid will still not be enough for you. Since you’re going to die either way, then you might as well make some contribution to the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect before your death.”

Keeping the scroll, a cold light flashed across Lin Yun’s pupils, and he smiled, “Then I might disappoint you because I’ll kill every single person on the list. I also won’t die reaching the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm!”

Lin Yun didn’t want to be underestimated by the old man.

After leaving the Main Palace, Lin Yun regained more of his rationale and couldn’t help smiling, “Looks like I’ve boasted a little too much this time.”

But just when he was going to go down the mountain, a piece of zither music drifted over from the distance and entered his ears. This instantly made Lin Yun’s eyes lit up because he knew that it was the white-clothed lady, and he was just in time to share some of her wine.

Lin Yun began to flicker in the sea of clouds as he executed the Golden Crow Nine Transformation and descended on the mountain that the zither music was coming from. He only hesitated briefly before he took out the jade flute and started to play it, playing the Dustlight Sword Art through the flute.

This wasn't their first time playing music together and soon found their own rhythm. Just like that, the zither and flute music complemented each other well and were like two phoenixes soaring through the mountains.

The intent of the Dustlight Sword Art was perfectly exhibited under the flute music that surprised the white-clothed lady. She didn’t hear this piece from Lin Yun before, and her fingers quickly strum on the zither, causing her music to be gentle. Then, her music paused briefly before it soared into the clouds like a phoenix.

This made Lin Yun smile because this woman seems to know him better than himself. This was the first time he played this piece, but she was able to match with him so quickly and easily. As the music became even louder, Lin Yun’s tune changed and his blood began to boil, exhibiting the last portion of the Dustlight Sword Art.

When he was done, it took some time for him to calm his surging emotions. When he saw the wine long prepared on the table, he smiled and stepped forth before gulping down the wine.

“There’s a huge change in your emotions through the music. Do you have anything bothering you?” Asked the white-clothed lady.

Lin Yun didn’t hide it from her and revealed what the sect master tasked him to do, taking out the scroll in the process.

When the white-clothed lady took the scroll over, she glanced at it briefly before she replied, “If you fight with the person on the first, you won’t even have a 30% chance of winning. The difference between your cultivation is too high, but you might have a chance of winning if you use the flute. After all, just your complete mastery of sky sword intent places you in an invincible position, not to mention that your sky sword intent has been mended in the Sword Saint Mountain and even fused with the Azure Dragon Sword Aura.”

Lin Yun was surprised as he looked at the white-clothed lady because he didn’t tell her that, and not even the sect master could guess that. Now, Lin Yun had a clearer view of the Saint Clans.

“You understand me well. This will be a dangerous trip, but I have no regrets about being able to drink such good wine before leaving!” Lin Yun laughed and gulped down the rest of the wine.

“If you like it, come back alive and I can prepare what you want,” smiled the white-clothed lady under the veil.

“Any wine?”

“Any.”

“Then I want the Millennium Flame!” Lin Yun chuckled.

“Sure.”

Lin Yun was only casually talking about it, but he didn’t think that the white-clothed lady would agree to it so casually. This instantly made him have a new impression of the Saint Clans.

“Then it looks like I have to make it back no matter what.” Lin Yun smiled. But before he left, he suddenly thought of something and asked, “I only know about your surname and I have no idea of your full name.”

“My surname is Luo, and my given name is Hua!”

Luo Hua, it was a weird name. But he soon smiled, “Actually, my other name also has something to do with flowers.”

He was naturally talking about his title as Flower Burial.

When Luo Hua looked over curious, Lin Yun merely smiled and left without any explanation. After all, his title as Flower Burial was accompanied by bloodbaths in the Heavenly Path, and he only needed one sword to kill. Now that he came to Kunlun Realm, it was also time for his title to shine.
