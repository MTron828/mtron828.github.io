Chapter 1433 - Heaven and Earth Rankings

“I have already brought it to the manifestation stage.” Lin Yun said after a brief pondering. “Can it be that there’s a higher stage than the manifestation stage?”

The Radiant Sword Saint looked at Lin Yun and asked, “Let me ask you, what is the manifestation stage?”

“One transforms the technique to make it their own and surpasses the limit by integrating their comprehension into it.” Lin Yun replied with a clear explanation.

“That’s right.” The Radiant Sword Saint nodded. “Then let me ask you, is your accomplishment in the sword stronger, or is the Southern Emperor’s accomplishment in the sword stronger?”

“The latter, of course.”Lin Yun blurted it out without thinking. When he was done, he realized something was wrong, making him furrow his brows. But he couldn’t figure out where the problem was. The sword technique did become stronger after reaching the manifestation stage, but why did it feel wrong?

When the Radiant Sword Saint saw Lin Yun in deep thoughts, he didn’t say a word. He gave Lin Yun some time to ponder before he said, “The Southern Emperor’s attainment in the sword is naturally stronger. So why do you have to walk out of his sword technique? Will it become stronger if you do?” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

The Radiant Sword Saint’s words stunned Lin Yun for a moment before he was enlightened. So he had only compared it with himself in the past and didn’t compare it to the Southern Emperor. But if that was the case, didn’t that mean that all the previous sword techniques he practiced were wrong?

“Don’t overthink it.” The Radiant Sword Saint looked at Lin Yun and said, “It’s inevitable for you to walk out of it, but you must walk back after walking out. No one has told you this before because not many people can reach the manifestation stage. So it will only make you run amok if you aren’t at the level to come in contact with that.”

“I have to walk back after walking out?” Lin Yun asked doubtfully.

“That’s right. That’s also the stage after the manifestation stage, the minuscule stage. This means that you have to walk back after walking out of the initial technique, reaching the minuscule stage.” The Radiant Sword Saint replied. “At least you have to understand why there are thirty-six strokes in the word. After entering the minuscule stage, you’ll reach the deification stage after walking out again.”

Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts, sensing that his conversation with the Radiant Sword Saint was more important than cultivating for years.

“Don’t bother learning any new sword techniques before reaching the Dragon Pulse Realm. Just focus on what you already have.” The Radiant Sword Saint said before he continued painting on the stone desk.

When Lin Yun looked at it from the side, he could see saint runes intertwining, and every stroke contained boundless sword intent. This made him curious because the Radiant Sword Saint was clearly not a saint spiritualist, so why did his painting give him the feeling that the Radiant Sword Saint was drawing saint runes?

“Curious?” The Radiant Sword Saint painted while he continued, “It doesn’t matter which path you take to become a saint because all paths converge at the end. The path above the Saint Realm is connected. No one is weaker than the other; it just depends on who can walk the furthest.”

When the Radiant Sword Saint was done, Lin Yun realized that it was a portrait of the Radiant Sword Saint himself. The entire painting was vivid, looking like a genuine saint who was sealed in a painting. Putting down his brush, the Radiant Sword Saint cut his finger and squeezed a drop of blood onto it.

“It’s done.” The Radiant Sword Saint nodded in satisfaction before giving it to Lin Yun. “Keep this painting well-protected. If you’re in danger in the future, unfold this painting, and it will summon my clone.”

Lin Yun trembled because this was equivalent to a talisman that could ensure his safety in crucial times.

“You can leave now. Come back here six months from now. Remember not to practice other sword techniques before reaching the Dragon Pulse Realm.” The Radiant Sword Saint said.

“This disciple will take his leave, then.” Lin Yun had no choice but to leave after stowing the painting. His thoughts weren’t calm because what happened today was too shocking for him, whether it was about the Radiant Sword Saint’s true identity or the minuscule stage. He needed some time to digest them.

When he came out of cave on Saint Mountain, Jue Chen had already left. There was a man dressed in a grey robe waiting there, and Lin Yun guessed that this person must be the senior brother who would bring him to the Divine Firmament Peak. This man looked pretty young, but his cultivation was in the Dragon Pulse Realm!

“Senior Brother, how do I address you?” Lin Yun stepped forth.

The grey-clothed youth nodded, smiling. “You can just call me Feng Luan. The Peak Master tasked me with leading you to the Divine Firmament Peak.”

As Feng Luan spoke, he was looking at Lin Yun with curiosity. Lin Yun was now a famous person. Not to mention that he was taken in as a disciple by the Radiant Sword Saint, who defeated Xiahou Yan when he joined the sect.

“Hehe. Junior Brother Lin, it has been a long time!” A chuckle resounded just when they were about to leave. Then, a familiar figure soon appeared before Lin Yun. It was Mu Qingqing.

“Junior Sister Mu, what are you doing here?” Feng Luan asked in a surprised tone.

“I’m naturally here to fetch Junior Brother Lin…” Mu Qingqing chuckled.

Feng Luan was shocked when he heard that. Does the Scarlet Firmament Peak want to snatch Lin Yun? Didn’t Ancestor Radiant take Lin Yun in as a disciple? What is she trying to do?

Mu Qingqing blinked before she smiled. “You’re so stupid. I’m naturally here to bring him to the Divine Firmament Peak and show him around the Sword Sect while I’m at it. What are you thinking about? Don’t worry because the Scarlet Firmament Peak won’t snatch someone from the Divine Firmament Peak!”

What Mu Qingqing said made Feng Luan wear an embarrassed smile before he awkwardly said, “Then, Junior Sister, you can come together with us.”

“Senior Brother, I wish to take Lin Yun to the Divine Firmament Peak myself.” Mu Qingqing said.

“This… doesn’t seem to be part of the rules.” Feng Luan replied.

“Why are you talking about the rules with me? Besides, you’re not as familiar with the sect as me. Don’t worry; I won’t kidnap him. Help me this time, and I’ll help you when you look for Junior Sister Chen when you go to the Emerald Firmament Peak.” Mu Qingqing winked and gave Feng Luan a playful smile.

Her words made Feng Luan’s face blush as he retorted, “Don’t talk nonsense. There’s nothing between Junior Sister Chen and me. I… I don’t mean it that way.”

“Senior Brother Feng, let Senior Sister Mu guide me.” Lin Yun awkwardly smiled upon seeing Feng Luan’s awkward expression.

“Then, let Junior Sister Mu guide you around. I’ll tell the Peak Master about this.” Feng Luan replied. When he saw Lin Yun nodding his head, Feng Luan breathed a sigh of relief before he whispered in Mu Qingqing’s ear and left.

This scene made Lin Yun smile and said, “That Senior Brother Feng is pretty adorable.”

“Is he as adorable as me?” Mu Qingqing tilted her head to the side.

“Of course not.” Lin Yun replied.

Hearing Lin Yun’s reply, Mu Qingqing squinted her eyes and nodded with a satisfied smile. She then rolled her eyes. “You’re pretty eloquent. Let’s go. I’ll bring you around. There’s no hurry to go to the Divine Firmament Peak.”

There’s no rush? Lin Yun had no idea what she was planning, making him wonder if she was here to kidnap him. After all, he remembered that she invited him several times in the name of the Scarlet Firmament Peak back in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect.

“Let me take you to a certain place first.” Mu Qingqing led Lin Yun into the sky before they shuttled through the clouds. When they landed on the ground, there was a massive stone platform, and they could see a vast land before them. It was a panoramic view with the entire Sword Sect right before them and seven peaks pierced into the clouds.

On the mountain, countless pavilions and palaces embellished the Sword Sect. Aside from that, there were also many mountains, and you could see the occasional waterfall. This was a majestic scenery, and Lin Yun couldn’t help being shocked. This is the Sword Sect?

He could also see people traveling through the air above the sky. Furthermore, there were some martial arenas where disciples sparred with each other, unleashing sword rays and creating many phenomena.

But what shocked Lin Yun the most was the floating stone monument. This monument was three thousand meters in height, and you could easily see the monument anywhere in the Sword Sect as long as you looked up.

“What is that?” Lin Yun muttered because he could see many names on the monument. It was different from the previous monument he saw, and Lin Yun felt that this monument was some sort of a ranking.

“That’s the Sword Sect’s Earth Ranking.” Mu Qingqing explained as she looked at the stone monument from afar.

“The Earth Ranking is meant for disciples at the Elysium Core Realm. Anyone at the Elysium Core Realm can challenge it, but only those in the top five hundred will appear on the monument.” Mu Qingqing explained.

Lin Yun then understood what was going on with his pupils flickering. It was equivalent to an inner ranking for those in the Sword Sect. This made him curious about how far he could reach on the Earth Ranking.

“What’s the matter? You can’t bear it any longer and want to give it a try?” Mu Qingqing smiled. “The Earth Ranking isn’t easy. It’s still hard for you to reach the top ten with your current strength.”

Lin Yun was surprised when he heard that. After all, he even defeated Xiahou Yan, so how could he believe he couldn’t make it into the top ten on the Earth Ranking if everyone was just in the Elysium Core Realm? Could it be that they all possessed the Innate Sword Physique and Innate Sword Heart? This was a little too unbelievable.

“You seem rather unconvinced.” Mu Qingqing smiled as she looked at Lin Yun’s expression. “To make it into the top ten, you need to be at least a three-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm. They’re all in their thirties, and their talent isn’t much weaker than Xiahou Yan. Some of them are even stronger than Xiahou Yan.”

Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts when he heard that. Then again, it was natural that cultivating in the Sword Sect was a lot faster.

“Since there’s an Earth Ranking, I bet there’s also the Heaven Ranking?” Lin Yun asked.

“That’s right.” Mu Qingqing’s expression became grave when it came to the Heaven Ranking. She looked behind the stone monument, where there were ten paintings, each representing a quota. They were the true monstrous geniuses of the Sword Sect.

“Only those who’ve reached the Dragon Pulse Realm are qualified to enter the Heaven Ranking. They’re the strongest amongst the younger generation of the Sword Sect. There are only ten quotas in the Heaven Ranking, and every disciple regards entering the Heaven Ranking as the highest honor.” Mu Qingqing briefly paused before she continued, “Amongst the ten on the current list, half of them are occupied by my Scarlet Firmament Peak. There’s not a single disciple from the Divine Firmament Peak.”
