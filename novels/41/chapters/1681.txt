Chapter 1682 – Sun and Moon

The water geysers were like tentacles as they coiled around Lin Wan and Luo Shuyi, their faces were pale and powerless, and they couldn’t bring out the full power of their cultivations. This was because the Blood-Horned Aquatic Serpents were too terrifying, containing a wisp of the pure dragon’s aura, far exceeding overlord demonic beasts in the same cultivation.

“Senior Sister, what should we do now?” Luo Shuyi asked in horror.

Lin Wan’s eyes flickered, but her facial expression was relatively calm. This was because she had a painting given to her by the Heavenly Note Sect’s sect master to ensure her safety. The moment she used it, it would summon the clone of a Saint.

Most saint disciples had something similar and it was extremely precious, so no one would use it unless it was absolutely necessary. Due to the enormous amount of exhaustion it would cause after summoning a Saint’s clone, a Saint’s disciple would only obtain one in their lifetime.

Seeing that they couldn’t deal with the Blood-Horned Aquatic Serpent, Lin Wan tossed the lute away and took out a painting with a flip of her wrist. A Saint's aura swept out when she held onto the painting, instantly suppressing the water tentacles around her.

“You’re a saint disciple!” The Blood-Horned Aquatic Serpent was first startled before it rejoiced. Saint disciples represent high talent and aptitude. If it could devour a saint disciple, it would have more confidence in evolving into a dragon-serpent. Then again, it was also bold to be so fearless, despite knowing that the other party was a saint disciple.

Like metal, the tentacles coiling around Luo Shuyi instantly became even more terrifying. Soon, cracking sounds came as Luo Shuyi screamed out in pain, her face distorted.

“Junior Sister!” The scream instantly caused Lin Wan to be distracted, and she quickly turned her head around.

Seeing this, the Blood-Horned Aquatic Serpent sneered and pounced over. When Lin Wan recollected herself, she was sent flying away, throwing out a mouthful of blood, and the painting in her hand flew out.

The Blood-Horned Aquatic Serpent was like a dragon pouncing forth and devouring the painting.

“Hahaha! The two of you want to fight this king? Surrender and be devoured by this king, becoming an ingredient for this king to evolve!” The Blood-Horned Aquatic Serpent laughed. It was taking a risk by coming to this route, but its tribulation was coming. If its bloodline couldn’t undergo a transformation and evolve to a dragon-serpent, it wouldn’t be able to make it through this tribulation.

Thus, it could only take a risk and come to this route. Fortunately, everyone on the ship were women, so they were the perfect ingredients for it to evolve into a dragon-serpent.

“Hahaha!” As the Blood-Horned Aquatic Serpent laughed, thunderclouds gathered and and thunder rumbled.

The water geysers were like ropes tying around Lin Wan and Luo Shuyi, bringing them to its mouth. At this moment, Lin Wan and Luo Shuyi were both filled with despair.

“I’m sorry, Senior Sister.” Luo Shuyi said, guilt filling her heart.

“It’s fine. We’re sisters. On the bright side, we can die together, not to mention that we’re still not dead yet. Perhaps a shining knight in armor might come and save us.” Lin Wan smiled. Perhaps because they would die in a moment, Lin Wan was calm after despair and even comforted the brawling Luo Shuyi.

Right then, a piece of ethereal flute music resounded as a person in white entered the storm. When this person came in, the tentacles tied around Luo Shuyi and Lin Wan crumbled.

This made the two ladies briefly shocked before they quickly retreated. “It’s him!”

“Lin Xiao!” The two ladies were surprised when they raised their heads. The person in white was Lin Xiao, whom they had met previously. He was donned in white, playing the flute, and wore a silver mask.

Lowering the flute, Lin Yun swiftly arrived before the two ladies. He could tell Luo Shuyi was injured while Lin Wan was fine, so his attention was mainly on Luo Shuyi. He asked, “Are the two of you alright?” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“We’re alright, but we’d have been dead if Young Master Lin was slightly slower.” Lin Wan looked at Lin Yun after calming herself down.

On the other hand, Luo Shuyi was worried and said, “Young Master Lin, be careful. This Blood-Horned Aquatic Serpent has the dragon clan’s bloodline. So we should return to the ship and make plans.”

“That’s right.” Lin Wan agreed.

But Lin Yun wasn’t too bothered because it was useless against him, who possessed the Blue Dragon Bone.

“None of you can leave!” The Blood-Horned Aquatic Serpent flew into a rage as it glared at Lin Yun. When it opened its jaws, a crimson soundwave swept out with immense pressure, causing an explosion on the sea's surface. The power contained within the soundwave nearly caused the surrounding space to crumble.

The Blood-Horned Aquatic Serpent’s attack came fast. Before Lin Yun could think, he stood before the two ladies and raised the Divine Jade Bamboo Flute to his lips. As he emitted a faint glow, he took a deep breath. As he blew on the flute, his fingers swiftly moved over the flute, reaching an unimaginable speed.

Simultaneously, the Golden Crow Saint Runes shone brightly in his profound palace, and Lin Yun instantly released hundreds of musical notes. When the crimson soundwave was about to reach him, a crimson sun rose behind him.

This was a crimson sun that rose to the sky, accompanied by rushed music that instantly lifted everyone’s hearts to their throats.

The crimson soundwave exploded before Lin Yun, forming a violent gale that blew on his clothes. His hair began to flutter, and the remnants of the soundwave raised a water screen that reached a thousand feet in height and could be seen ten miles away.

Lin Yun didn’t take a step back as the two soundwaves collided, but the Blood-Horned Aquatic Serpent was pushed back. This song was called Sun and Moon, one of the ten ancient songs that Lil’ Purple taught him. The specialty of this song was fast and could reach an unimaginable height. He wanted to suppress the Blood-Horned Aquatic Serpent and kill the latter immediately.

This domineering ancient song left him with no path of retreat. If his opponent interrupted or suppressed him, he would instantly suffer severe injuries from the backlash.

Seeing this, Luo Shuyi and Lin Wan were both dumbfounded, with their mouths wide open. They couldn’t say a word because it was too terrifying for Lin Yun to play over a thousand musical notes in a breath’s time. Not only that, but Lin Yun could play the intent contained within the song perfectly and instantly heavily injure his opponent.

Since Lin Wan and Luo Shuyi had high attainment in the sword, they could tell how terrifying Lin Yun’s achievement in music dao was.

As Lin Yun continued to play music, he slowly walked forth, and the crimson sun behind him rose to the sky, emitting a terrifying pressure that pressed down. When the sun rose to the sky, it cleared the thunderclouds that were above them. The storm had stopped, and only a piece of music could be heard being played.

No matter how the Blood-Horned Aquatic Serpent tried, it couldn’t get close to Lin Yun. On the other hand, Lin Yun’s hair fluttered in the wind as he slowly approached the Blood-Horned Aquatic Serpent. When he was less than a thousand meters away from the Blood-Horned Aquatic Serpent, the serpent collapsed as multiple wounds appeared on its body, causing it to let out a painful howl.

As the Blood-Horned Aquatic Serpent threw out a mouthful of blood, the Saint painting that it had previously devoured was also spat out.

“Descending Sun!” Raising his brow, a cold light flashed within Lin Yun’s pupils. As he soared to the sky, he immediately reached the height of the crimson sun, and the crimson sun was like a meteorite as it descended on the Blood-Horned Aquatic Serpent.

As he started the music with a high start, his soul energy and physique struggled to continue playing it before he could finish it. Thus, he could only let the crimson sun descend like a meteorite.

As the crimson sun and the Blood-Horned Aquatic Serpent collided, flames ignited on the serpent, causing it to let out an even more painful howl. The wound on its body began to expand, and the massive impact caused it to clash with the sea.

Seeing this, Lin Yun stopped as he gasped for breath and slowly descended from the sky. Standing on the sea’s surface, he briefly staggered before stabilizing himself. His sword intent could sense that the heavily injured Blood-Horned Aquatic Serpent was swiftly fleeing for its life. He was lucky that the Blood-Horned Aquatic Serpent escaped, or even he would be in trouble.

Meanwhile, Luo Shuyi and Lin Wan landed beside Lin Yun with their musical instruments. Lin Wan concernedly asked, “Young Master Lin, are you alright?”

Lin Yun had played the song too quickly earlier, reaching such a terrifying height that his heart nearly flew out. But he wasn’t affected by the song because he was the one who played it so that he could bring the song to perfection in a split second. When it reached perfection, Lin Yun’s music continued to climb, badly frightening Lin Wan and Luo Shuyi.

Lin Yun smiled because he knew the two ladies were probably severely frightened. Even he was afraid of himself earlier.

Meanwhile, Luo Shuyi examined him, and she was sure this person wasn’t Lin Yun.

“I’m alright. The Blood-Horned Aquatic Serpent won’t appear again.” Lin Yun smiled.

“Thank you for saving us.” Lin Wan and Luo Shuyi expressed their gratitude.

Playing around with the flute in his hand, Lin Yun replied, “The river is really small for us to run into each other again.”

After interacting with An Liuyan, he regained his confidence in the Divine Tortoise Transformation and wasn’t afraid to meet Luo Shuyi and Lin Wan.

Lin Wan flew to the sky and grabbed a painting. This painting emitted a saint radiance. Even after the Blood-Horned Aquatic Serpent devoured it, it was still clean and unstained.

Lin Yun could tell with a glance that this was a Saint Diagram. This was because the Radiant Sword Saint had given him a similar one. The Radiant Sword Saint then descended and slew six demonic sects’ Samsara Edict Realm experts.

Looking at the painting, Lin Yun couldn’t help feeling sad as he thought of his master, wondering how his master was now.

“Young Master Lin, you must come on our ship this time, no matter what!” Lin Wan was in a good mood since the crisis was resolved and she could get her saint diagram back. When she looked at Lin Yun, her pupils were blazing with flames.

Luo Shuyi also looked at Lin Yun with anticipation. It could be a familiar face under that mask, even if the hope was slim.

Lin Yun came to his senses and briefly pondered before he replied, “You guys are going to the Heavenly Domain City? If that’s the case, we can travel together for some time.”

“Young Master Lin, you can just travel with us.” Lin Wan and Luo Shuyi smiled after exchanging a gaze.
