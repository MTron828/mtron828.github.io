Chapter 2212 - Secret

Tian Xing smiled as he was reduced to light, merging with the sunlight that scattered throughout every corner of the Heavenly Dao Sect. Everything happened too quickly, and Tian Xing disappeared by the time everyone came to their senses.

After today, there wouldn’t be anyone playing the zither on the Celestial Purging Mountain, and no one knew if they would hear the Crane Fairy’s laughter again.

Lin Yun suddenly knew why Tian Xing came at the very last moment. The latter was only a remnant soul, so he could only stay for a brief moment once he appeared outside the Celestial Purging Mountain. That’s why, once he showed up, he slayed everyone who was related to this matter.

It was just like scraping the bone to remove the poison. The Heavenly Dao Sect was riddled with pests, and now they were all cleaned up by him. The Heavenly Dao Sect might suffer a huge impact because of this incident, with their reputation dropping, but they might be able to welcome a new life.

The pile of flesh left behind by the red-clothed youth began to shine with a faint radiance. The red-clothed youth was a clone of the Blood Moon Sect. He was strong and managed to suppress the entire Heavenly Dao Sect.

Although the Great Saints weren’t at their prime, they wouldn’t be his opponent even if they were at their prime and joined hands, judging from the strength that he displayed. But someone like him was killed by the Heavenly Sword.

Tian Xing relied on his identity as the previous sect master to mobilize the Heavenly Sword’s sword wielder, killing the red-clothed youth with one strike. The red-clothed youth was only the clone of an Emperor and not the Emperor himself.

“The Undying Phoenix Scripture?” Ye Guhan’s face changed, and he said, “Get back!”

He had fought the red-clothed youth before and only caught the red-clothed youth by surprise and inflicted heavy injuries. He had to pay a great price when they fought after that, forcing the red-clothed youth to use the Undying Phoenix Scripture. Since this scene was similar to back then, Ye Guhan couldn’t help feeling worried.

Everyone quickly retreated while becoming nervous. The dazzling radiance blinded everyone’s eyes before the radiance exploded, and a terrifying aura swept out. This instantly made everyone tense up.

The Solar Divine Rune within Lin Yun’s body reacted, making Lin Yun feel uncertain before he recalled something. He yelled, “Senior Brother, it’s the Lunar Divine Rune!”

It wasn’t the Undying Phoenix Scripture, but the Lunar Divine Rune that was with the red-clothed youth.

“The Lunar Divine Rune?” Ye Guhan squinted.

But Lin Yun’s reminder was already too late. The pile of flesh that was left behind by the red-clothed youth was reduced to ashes before soaring to the sky.

Wang Muyan waved her hand in mid-air and took the Lunar Divine Rune into her body. With a wave, she grabbed the dispirited Zhao Tianyu, “Let’s go!”

The female Saint Sovereign, the guardian of Zhao Tianyu, stayed beside him, which was how she managed to escape the fate of being slaughtered by Tian Xing.

The three entered the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda, and the pagoda began to release a time-space fluctuation. Shortly after, a vortex appeared with the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda at the center. As the vortex spiralled, it released a space-time fluctuation into the surroundings. Everyone knew that the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda was going to escape.

All the Great Saints were heavily injured, as well as Lin Yun. Not to mention that the plaza was in a mess, and no one could do a thing as they watch the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda.

“Can’t the Heavenly Sword and Dao Sword make a move again?” The Dao Yang Holy Son had anger reflected in his eyes. After all, that was the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda. It was the Heavenly Dao Sect’s time-space treasure, containing treasures that were collected by the sect for thousands of years.

The Great Saints were silent, and the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint clearly couldn’t make a move. Ultimately, the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda disappeared into the vortex along with Wang Muyan and Zhao Tianyu. With that, the storm had finally come to an end.

The Heavenly Dao Sect suffered heavy casualties from this event. The Heavenly Wheel Pagoda was stolen, and the five Great Saints were heavily injured. The Nether Orchid Courtyard was practically destroyed.

Dawn dispelled the darkness. Regardless of the casualties, the Heavenly Dao Sect had survived this ordeal. But no one was happy because the price for the Heavenly Dao Sect's survival was too high. Amidst the silence, everyone couldn’t help looking at Lin Yun because they knew that Ye Qingtian was Lin Yun, and Lin Yun was Ye Qingtian!

The Great Saints already knew this, but everyone else only knew that now. To them, they were deeply shocked when Lin Yun revealed his identity. Who could’ve thought that the famous Flower Burial would be hiding within the Heavenly Dao Sect? Furthermore, he didn’t keep a low-profile at all, as Ye Qingtian was ranked first on the King Ranking and became the Heavenly Dragon Lord.

This matter couldn’t be concealed and would soon spread throughout the Eastern Desolation or the Kunlun Realm.

“Brat, thank you for your help today. No matter what, the Heavenly Dao Sect owes you one. Otherwise, I don’t know how many more casualties there would have been. No matter what, you will always be a saint disciple of the Heavenly Dao Sect in my eyes,” the Thousand Plume Great Saint said, looking at Lin Yun.

“We thank Flower Burial for his help today!” The other Saints cupped their hands together. This scene was shocking because a group of Saints were thanking a Quasi-Saint.

“But the Heavenly Dao Sect is in a mess now, and I don’t have the time to talk. Ye Guhan!” The Thousand Plume Great Saint called out, but Ye Guhan was nowhere to be seen.

“I’m here! I’m here!” Ye Guhan was in a corner with a Divine Dragon Fruit in his hand.

“Take your junior brother away to treat his injuries and look after him,” the Thousand Plume Great Saint said furiously, looking at Ye Guhan.

“Hehe, don’t worry about that. Junior brother has my love, so no one can harm him with me around,” Ye Guhan smiled.

But the Thousand Plume Great Saint ignored Ye Guhan, and his face gradually became cold with his murderous intent brewing. He said, “Now, it’s time to clean up the remains of the Ye Clan and Blood Moon Sect.”

Since everything had come to an end, they were naturally going to clean up thoroughly.

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint came over to take Bai Shuying away with her. She glanced at Lin Yun but didn’t mention the Solar Divine Rune.

After everyone left, the Serene Dust Great Saint appeared beside Lin Yun with the Azure Jade Purification Vase and examined his injuries. The radiance released from the vase enveloped Lin Yun, and he could feel a warmth coursing throughout his body.

The saint liquid swiftly penetrated Lin Yun’s body, making him comfortable. Regardless of external or internal injuries, they were all recovering very rapidly, and Lin Yun could sense a boundless life force within his body.

“Mistress, what treasure is this? It feels comfortable, and my injuries have recovered,” Lin Yun smiled. He had exhausted his vitality and tapped into his life force to forcibly activate the seven glory spirits of the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella. Although it wasn’t as dangerous as when he was at the Ancient Barren Battlefield, his injuries were serious, and he would take at least half a month to recover.

But now that the Serene Dust Great Saint made a move, not only did his injuries recover, there weren’t any hidden injuries left behind.

“This is the source of the Azure Jade Saint Liquid. The Serene Dust Great Saint wasn’t even willing to use it to treat us, so you got a bargain,” Ye Guhan smiled. “Serene Dust Great Saint, why don’t you let me use it too?”Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Get lost. You’re useless as the senior brother and only know how to eat.” The Serene Dust Great Saint glared at Ye Guhan before she dotingly looked at Lin Yun. She smiled, “Lin Yun is better than you. He blocked the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda and killed four Saint Lords. Only someone like him looks like a disciple of Radiant.”

“Thank you, Mistress,” Lin Yun smiled.

“You have a sweet mouth,” the Serene Dust Great Saint smiled.

“Mistress, why don’t you let me use it as well? My injuries are serious as well,” Ye Guhan said.

“You’re shameless. You’re a Great Saint!” The Serene Dust Great Saint snorted and ignored Ye Guhan.

This made Ye Guhan smile bitterly. They were both disciples of the Radiant Sword Saint, but the treatment they received was too different. When Lin Yun recovered from his injuries, the Serene Dust Great Saint left, heading towards the Nether Orchid Courtyard and gathered up Xin Yan to treat the injured.

When Lin Yun came to the plaza, Xin Yan arrived at the Nether Orchid Courtyard. There were many injured at the Nether Orchid Courtyard who couldn’t retreat in time. They were all from the Golden Guard. It was lucky that she came in time and saved many of the Golden Guard who were on the brink of death.

“Master, are you alright?” Lin Yun asked as he supported the Dragon Origin Great Saint. The Serene Dust Great Saint had already taken a look, and the Dragon Origin Great Saint’s injuries had stabilized before she left.

“I’m fortunate that she has left. Otherwise, I would be in trouble when you call me ‘Master’,” the Dragon Origin Great Saint bitterly smiled. But anyone could tell he was happy when Lin Yun addressed him as “Master.”

“That’s because you’re my master,” Lin Yun said.

“You have already disclosed your identity as Flower Burial, and yet you’re still willing to address me as Master?” The Dragon Origin Great Saint asked.

“Of course,” Lin Yun nodded. The Dragon Origin Great Saint treated him well, and Lin Yun remembered the favors.

The Dragon Origin Great Saint looked at Lin Yun with a complicated gaze, before he said, “Radiant is really lucky to have you as his disciple. But it doesn’t matter because you’re also my disciple!”

His laughter was hearty, but it couldn’t conceal his depression. After all, he lost to the Golden-Eyed Demonspirit in terms of physique. He patted Lin Yun’s shoulder and looked much older, saying, “Stay in the Heavenly Dao Sect for now. Find me before you leave. I might not be comparable to Radiant, but I still have some attainment in body-refinement that I don’t want to bring to the coffin.”

“This old man is really dramatic. It’s not embarrassing to lose to a Golden-Eyed Demonspirit, not to mention it couldn’t be considered a loss,” Ye Guhan sighed. He could understand why the Dragon Origin Great Saint was depressed.

As everything came to an end, it wouldn’t take long before the storm this incident created sweeps throughout the Eastern Desolation. From today onwards, the Heavenly Dao Sect would no longer be the strongest amongst the holy lands, and they would need a long time to recuperate. All the ‘prestige’ that they had in the past was completely ruined.

Lil’ Red rushed over with two treasures, the Black Thunder Chains and Thunder Demon Subduing Beads. Everyone had left the plaza aside from Lin Yun, Lil’ Red, Lil’ Purple, and Ye Guhan.

“Junior Brother, you won’t introduce this little girl to me?” Ye Guhan looked at Lil’ Purple, knowing that his junior brother really had a lot of secrets.

Lin Yun smiled, “I also want to know her identity. Speaking of which, why do you know the Profound Sky Canon?”

“Who’s a little girl? Listen well!” But Lil' Purple unhappily spoke out before Ye Guhan could reply to Lin Yun. She glared at Ye Guhan and said, “I am…”
