Chapter 2357 - Union!

Lin Yun swung his sword, empowering his attack with Nirvana Dao. He unleashed a massive sword ray with two golden lotuses behind him as he circulated the two sword canons. He also released his Quasi-Bright Sun Sword Intent and the nine thousand ribbons.

But that wasn’t all, he also released his Sovereign Constellation. He didn’t hold back and could feel that as he released his sword intent, the vortex of primal chaos became firmer, especially after using Nirvana Dao. This allowed Lin Yun to give off a powerful aura from a thousand meters away.

“Break!” When he unleashed his sword, the sword ray reached four hundred feet and he swung down, causing a massive commotion with a powerful energy fluctuation, which sent Lin Yun flying away. When he landed on the ground and raised his head, his facial expression became grave.

A fine crack appeared in the vortex of primal chaos, giving Lin Yun a headache. If his strongest attack failed, he could only leave this place and lose to Shangguan Jue. But in the next moment, the fine crack began to spread out, making Lin Yun heave a sigh in relief as he approached the vortex.

At the center of the vortex, there was a transparent painting with a revolving sun and moon, each possessing frightening power that would be unleashed if he came into contact with them. But in the next moment, the balance broke as countless phenomena began to appear, looking like a starry sky.

“Heaven?” Lin Yun stepped on the ground. This painting gave him a feeling that it was heaven, and he seemed to be stepping on the ‘heaven.’ This was a weird feeling because there was also a painting in the mirror. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

But this mirror wasn’t the same as before. It was a three-meter bronze mirror that had a blue dragon in its reflection. When Lin Yun looked in the mirror, the coldly blue dragon looked at him, with countless paintings behind the blue dragon.

Lin Yun muttered and teased himself, “I knew that it wouldn’t be that simple. There’s no advantage with my identity as the Iris Sword Saint’s heir...”

Lin Yun’s gaze became serious, and he said, “Let me look at how tough the divine dragon is!”

While Lin Yun had run into a bottleneck, Shangguna Jue didn’t feel great, either. After reaching three hundred phenomena, each mirror became increasingly challenging to break, even with the Eye of Destiny. After three hundred and eleven phenomena, a bizarre scene occurred. The person reflected in the mirror also possessed an Eye of Destiny.

This made Shangguan Jue briefly stunned, but he wasn’t too bothered about it anymore since he had already won when he achieved three hundred phenomena. He smiled, “Since I have already won, why bother about the rest? I can just have some fun here.”

There was a commotion outside, with everyone feeling nervous.

“I wonder how many phenomena Lin Yun will find. It will probably be over a hundred.”

“After a hundred, what rewards will the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron give out?” The commotion continued with everyone’s attention on Lin Yun and Shangguan Jue.

“Lin Jiangxian, how many phenomena do you think Lin Yun can find?” Ao Jue asked. When he asked that, everyone turned their gazes over. After all, Lin Jiangxian’s talent as a swordsman was publicly acknowledged. If it was her, she could give an accurate answer.

Lin Jiangxian said, “Lin Yun has grasped the Quasi-Bright Sun Sword Intent, and he might have other trump cards. I feel that he can find at least two hundred.”

Her words instantly caused an uproar.

“Two hundred? Isn’t that too unbelievable?”

“Well, it’s not unbelievable if you consider his strength.”

“The key is on Shangguan Jue!”

“Yeah. He knew Lin Yun’s potential, so he must be confident since he dared to bet, wanting to trample on Lin Yun using the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron.”

“It looks like the situation doesn’t look good for Lin Yun.”

Compared to others, Lin Jiangxian wasn’t too bothered about Shangguan Jue. She was more concerned about what Profound Sky Venerable said, that the limit Lin Yun and Shangguan Jue could reach was three hundred, and the highest record in Heaven’s Gate’s history was nine hundred.

This information was more important than the bet because she wondered if Lin Yun managed to find the key in Profound Sky Venerable’s words.

“He’s just a mortal blood, and he’s destined to lose.”

“That’s right. If Lin Yun was in the outside world, who knows how many times he would’ve died.”

“Shangguan Jue will win!” Many people were supportive of Shangguan Jue. After all, more people from the Divine Clans and immortal holy lands made it to this stage.

Everyone was anxiously waiting, before someone ran out of patience and said, “The incense is almost done burning. So why hasn’t it come to an end yet? It only took four hours for others, at most.”

Suddenly, a commotion came from the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron and Shangguan Jue opened his eyes first with paintings appearing behind him. This was a grand scene that even made the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron tremble.

Something even more unbelievable occurred as Shangguan Jue’s cultivation began to rise. Sensing the saint energy within his body, Shangguan Jue laughed, looking arrogant with so much excitement that his face also became distorted. “Hahaha! Who can rival me in this world?!”

Shangguan Jue’s hair fluttered in the wind, and everyone could sense the pressure that he gave off. At the same time, eighteen Divine Dragon Destiny Pellets flew out of the cauldron, shocking everyone.

“How is this possible? Three hundred and fifty phenomena!”

“Three hundred and fifty phenomena, eighteen Divine Dragon Destiny Pellets! Shangguan Jue is ruthless.”

“Lin Yun is finished now.” Many people were shocked while the Shadow Divine Palace’s disciples cheered for Shangguan Jue with excitement on their faces.

Seeing this, Zhao Zhanli heaved a sigh in relief, and smiled, “He’s heaven-defying. How is he going to lose now?”

“Hahaha! How is he going to lose now? Senior Brother Zhao, look at the shock on Profound Sky Venerable’s face! He probably never expected this!” The disciples of the Shadow Divine Palace were excited while looking at Profound Sky Venerable’s face.

“Didn’t he say that three hundred was the max? It looks like he made a mistake, hahaha!”

Profound Sky Venerable was shocked because he felt that three hundred was the max for the two of them, but Shangguan Jue exceeded that number. He swiftly calmed down, and said, “It looks like you used an external item, but it doesn’t matter.”

When he looked at those from the Shadow Divine Palace, he inwardly sneered because he had seen countless geniuses. Shangguan Jue was a talent, but he didn’t make a mistake. Then again, it looked like Lin Yun was going to lose now.

Stowing the eighteen Divine Dragon Destiny Pellets, Shangguan Jue had excitement on his face. He couldn’t contain his emotions, and began laughing aloud with no one daring to say a word.

Shangguan Jue looked at Lin Yun, and smiled, “Three Flame Origin Pellets with a wave of a hand? Three Flame Origin Pellets are nothing compared to eighteen Divine Dragon Destiny Pellets!”

He didn’t conceal his words, and his voice spread far and wide. He felt that he finally took revenge for having the limelight stolen by Lin Yun before.

“Flower Burial, come out. How long are you going to keep pretending to be dead? Kowtow and get lost from the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron!” Shangguan Jue raised his brow and no longer pretended to be a gentleman. This made Lin Jiangxian and others unhappy, but there was nothing they could do about Shangguan Jue.

“I’m not pretending to be dead...” Lin Yun’s voice resounded as he opened his eyes.

“Admit defeat quickly!” Shangguan Jue roared with excitement on his face.

But in the next second, a bell began to echo in the world, and someone exclaimed, “That’s the sound of heavenly dao!”

In the next second, a primordial aura poured from the sky, but that wasn’t all. Countless paintings suddenly flew out from Lin Yun. There were too many paintings, looking like a waterfall pouring out from him. This lasted a few minutes and still showed no signs of stopping, leaving everyone in disbelief. The number of paintings had already exceeded hundreds.

It showed no signs of stopping even after it reached five thousand paintings. When everything stopped, everyone was dumbfounded because there were ten thousand paintings behind Lin Yun. When all the paintings opened up, more primordial aura began pouring down from the sky.

“How is this possible?! Ten thousand phenomena! Is he still a human?”

“He found all the phenomena left behind by the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity!”

“This is insane!” Everyone went insane and was dumbfounded, looking at this scene with disbelief. Cracks began to appear in the sky, alarming the divine guards within the Heavenly Barren Realm and they landed beside Profound Sky Venerable with grave expressions.

“Profound Sky, what’s the situation?” They looked at Profound Sky Venerable, wanting an answer from him.

As Lin Yun roared, all the phenomenon was stowed by him and combined into a painting consisting of a sun and a moon beneath him, “Union!”

A vibrating noise resounded as they formed into a golden jade slip that hovered in the sky. The jade slip was engraved with ancient divine runes, which Lin Yun grabbed a hold of. In the next second, an indigo aura and a blue dragon flew out from the cauldron, along with a dragon roar. The blue dragon coiled up and formed a dazzling pellet with complicated dragon runes, and each rune looked like an actual divine dragon.

“It’s the Divine Sovereign Dragon Pellet!” Profound Sky Venerable exclaimed.

As for Shangguan Jue, he was already left dumbfounded as he collapsed on the ground, muttering, “H-How is this possible?!”

“The bet.” Lin Yun snatched the eighteen Divine Dragon Destiny Pellets from Shangguan Jue, and smiled, “They’re treasures, but they belong to me now.”

At this moment, Lin Yun’s smile nearly drove Shangguan Jue insane. But Lin Yun didn’t stop there as he laughed, “Hahaha! But that’s not the end. The twenty Flame Origin Pellets and three hundred paintings also belong to me! So prepare them quickly!”

Lin Yun jumped down from the cauldron after he was done speaking and walked over to Profound Sky Venerable, which made the latter’s heart throb.

“Venerable, I wonder if you still mean what you said? I have exceeded nine hundred, and you must eat the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron,” Lin Yun smiled. “How would you like it? Steamed or roasted?”

Everyone present was dumbfounded because Lin Yun was too arrogant. The other party was Profound Sky Venerable, an Emperor Realm expert!

Profound Sky Venerable looked awkward, with his face becoming ashen. How long had it been since he was being pointed in the face, not to mention by a junior? But he couldn’t refute what Lin Yun said, and lowered his voice, “Young friend, I’m sorry about before. I admit that I was a little too loud earlier.”
