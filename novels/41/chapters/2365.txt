Chapter 2366 - Silver-Eyed Demonspirit

Xiong Tiannan took a deep breath and said, “Only those with noble bloodlines can construct a tomb. Most demonspirits will choose a grave to use when slumbering. There are fake graves, there might also be one with a demonspirit lying in it, and there might also be traps.”

When Xiong Tiannan looked around, he noticed some details were different.

“There are really a lot of people.” Lin Yun looked around and could see many people descending into the woods. This commotion would quickly alarm those monsters sleeping in the graves.

“Big Brother Lin, what should we do?” Xiong Tiannan looked at Lin Yun. Although he liked to explore tombs, he couldn’t decide now.

“Let’s decide as we go. Walk toward the graves, and check what’s in there,” Lin Yun said calmly. There was nothing to consider, since they would know after checking themselves.

Lin Yun walked forth with everyone following behind him. Everyone had a rapport to stay together since these woods were weird.

When more people arrived, the peace in the woods was disrupted as roars and screams could be heard. Along the way, Lin Yun’s group also encountered many demonic beasts. They were strong, but those demonic beasts didn’t even bring any trouble to them, so Lin Yun didn’t even have to make a move.

Suddenly, a grave before them exploded with a coffin flying out, smashing apart a tree and coming in Lin Yun’s direction.

Xiong Tiannan was swift as he threw out a punch, shattering the coffin. The power of his punch continued on and landed on the corpse within the coffin. But the punch felt like it came in contact with metal and couldn’t destroy the corpse.

The defenses of the corpse surprised Xiong Tiannan. This demonspirit was two meters tall, and its physique was as tough as a Glory Saint Artifact. But Xiong Tiannan didn’t believe it and threw a few more punches at the demonspirit. The demonspirit was fine and unharmed before the demonspirit merely used a punch to send Xiong Tiannan flying away.

“What’s going on?” Xiong Tiannan’s face changed. This was only an ordinary demonspirit at the sixth-stage Saint Lord, so it wasn’t too powerful.

“Watch out!” Lin Jiangxian warned.

When Xiong Tiannan raised his head, the vertical eye on the demonspirit opened and its clothes tore apart, revealing its body covered in demonic runes while letting out a roar, releasing its demonic aura.

Xiong Tiannan no longer dared to belittle the demonspirit and used his divine physique to face this demonspirit. But as they fought, the demonspirit didn’t fall into a disadvantage.

“You go take a look at him. Use your flames,” Lin Yun said to Ji Zixi.

A demonspirit’s physique was even more powerful than divine physiques, which was unbelievable. But in terms of intelligence and saint dao, Xiong Tiannan held the advantage, but he couldn’t suppress the demonspirit no matter how much he tried. So they could only try another method.

Ji Zixi soared to the sky and a phoenix cry echoed. The Phoenix Sacred Flame manifested into a divine phoenix that incinerated the demonspirit. The high temperature even made Xiong Tiannan fearful. He quickly took a few steps back before the temperature settled down.

“Burn it to death!” Xiong Tiannan cheered as the demonspirit let out a painful cry.

Ji Zixi also wore a smile, but her smile soon disappeared. The demonspirit ignored the flame and continued to charge at Xiong Tiannan. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

This made Xiong Tiannan frown and quickly retreated. He could still put up a fight when the demonspirit wasn't covered in flames, but it was enveloped in phoenix fire right now, which made Xiong Tiannan avoid a frontal confrontation.

“Let me give it a try,” Lin Jiangxian said as she drew her sword, releasing her Divine Light Sword Intent as she performed the Heavenly Divine Sword, forcing the demonspirit to take a hundred steps back under her attack. But even after ten-odd attacks, she still couldn’t kill the demonspirit.

The demonspirit felt that its life was threatened and escaped without a second thought.

“Don’t let it escape!” Xiong Tiannan roared. At the same time, ten-odd heads appeared from the ground. They were all demonic corpses.

“I’ll leave them to you,” Lin Yun said as he dashed out.

Lin Jiangxian only felt a flash, before Lin Yun had stopped the demonspirit. This alarmed Lin Jiangxian because she realized Lin Yun didn’t even use his movement technique and only merged with his sword. “What speed!”

Facing the incoming demonspirit, Lin Yun didn’t draw his sword but raised his right hand.

“Lin Yun, don’t be careless!” Lin Jiangxian reminded, worried that Lin Yun would underestimate the demonspirit.

But when Lin Yun pushed his hand forth, a violent gale blew that forced Lin Jiangxian to close her eyes. When she opened her eyes, a palm print appeared on the demonspirit’s chest as it fell to its knees. Even so, the demonic runes on the demonspirit didn’t dissipate.

“How is this possible?” Lin Jiangxian was surprised. She didn’t doubt Lin Yun’s mastery of the sword, but she was surprised to see that Lin Yun was so strong even without using his sword, which was unbelievable.

“Stop staring in the air and deal with it together!” Lin Yun called out. Ji Zixi and Lin Jiangxian then came over to gang up on the demonspirit, and they spent a great amount of effort to kill it. After killing it, the head exploded and a silver ray shone.

“Spirit core!” Everyone rejoiced as they came forth and saw the bead in Lin Yun’s hand. This bead was white, containing a complicated aura with saint origin, saint daos, and martial intents all mashed together, looking weird.

“This is the spirit core? It’s really a treasure.” Ao Jue asked as he came over. The spirit core was the demonspirit’s vertical eye, similar to saint origin. He had only heard of it but had never seen it before.

“It looks like we’re pretty lucky?” Lin Jiangxian smiled. Not every grave had a demonspirit, and some graves had demonic corpses. Even if those demonic corpses were killed, they wouldn’t produce a spirit core.

“The defenses were really powerful,” Xiong Tiannan said with lingering fear. If he had no help, he would have been in trouble while facing this demonspirit.

Ji Zixi said, “The demonic runes looked weird. It's as if they can even withstand sacred flame, sword intent, and primordial aura.”

Lin Yun nodded and also couldn’t find a way to deal with it anytime soon. It was fortunate that they were strong enough to forcibly kill it. The demonspirit was only a sixth-stage Saint Lord, so they would be in trouble if they faced a seven-stage Saint Lord.

“You keep it.” Lin Yun handed the spirit core over to Xiong Tiannan before they continued their journey. They began to search for graves and kill demonspirits, collecting their spirit cores. They had collected twenty spirit cores in just four hours.

The woods didn’t seem to be as dangerous as they had imagined. Just when everyone felt relieved, Lin Yun was surprised as he looked ahead.

The ground suddenly trembled as a meteorite blazing with black flames descended from the sky.

“What?” Xiong Tiannan was shocked because the meteorite was massive, leaving cracks in space when it fell. But before the meteorite landed, an azure figure charged out and threw a punch forth, executing the Sovereign Dragon Fist—Soaring Divine Dragon.

When a dragon’s roar echoed, the meteorite was destroyed. When the fragments fell, the trees lit up on fire and soon withered.

This made the faces of everyone change as they sensed the frightening aura. This was a Silver-Eyed Demonspirit. When they approached Lin Yun’s side, they saw a silver coffin hovering in the air with strange patterns engraved on it.

When the coffin opened, a silver-robed youth walked out with indifference.

“This is bad. That is a Silver-Eyed Demonspirit,” Ao Jue said nervously. A Silver-Eyed Demonspirit differed from what they faced in the past, since those demonspirits were half-dead. But this Silver-Eyed Demonspirit looked as though it was forcibly awoken from his sleep, and the aura he gave off was much stronger than other demonspirits.

“Who are you guys? How dare you disrupt my sleep!” The Silver-Eyed Demonspirit roared and waved his hand. Ten coffins then appeared from the ground with demonic corpses stepping out—ten Saint Realm demonic corpses and a Silver-Eyed Demonspirit.

Lin Yun frowned as he began to look around. Something didn’t seem right. There weren’t any graves in the surroundings, and the appearance of this Silver-Eyed Demonspirit was abrupt.

“What should we do?” Ao Jue asked.

“Let me face him. You guys deal with the other demonic corpses,” Lin Yun calmly said with a chill flashing in his eyes. He wanted to know who was behind this.

Ao Jue and the others were shocked. This Silver-Eyed Demonspirit might look young, but it might’ve lived for thousands of years and was at least an eighth-stage Saint Lord. Silver-Eyed Demonspirits were incredibly strong and were practically invincible as long as they were a seventh-stage Saint Lord.

“Leave it to me. I want to see how strong this Silver-Eyed Demonspirit is,” Lin Yun said.
