Chapter 1208 - Lightning Shadow Sword

Lin Yun had successfully broken the Four Phase Sword Array that was under the control of four Elysium Core Realm experts. At the same time, the brutality that he displayed exceeded everyone’s expectations.

At the same time, everyone was shocked by the sword holy spirit that Lin Yun displayed. Combined with his talent in the sword, Lin Yun was more monstrous than any of the geniuses present.

With a single thought, the azure sword slowly disappeared into Lin Yun’s body. Then, the terrifying pressure that had permeated the surroundings was slowly disappearing.

As Lin Yun stared at the decapitated corpses on the ground, he began to wonder if he had underestimated the power of the azure sword holy spirit. The holy spirit was too terrifying and he had a feeling that not even experts in the Dragon Pulse Realm could face it after restricting their cultivation in the Heavenly Soul Realm.

He didn’t even pair the holy spirit with the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords, but it was still strong enough to blind the elders. The aura was so sharp that it was hard for people to look at it.

Initially, Lin Yun thought that he would die, but the holy spirit proved him wrong. In fact, if he summoned the true holy spirit of the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords at the beginning of the battle, he wouldn’t have been in such dire straits.

Then again, it was understandable since this was the first time he had used the holy spirit to fight. He also didn’t have a chance to bring out the holy spirit before killing Feng Tianyuan. After all, that old geezer was vicious and harassed him right from the start of the fight.

Collecting himself, Lin Yun took another Nirvana Pellet and tended to his wounds. The wounds he received from the elders’ swords were still bleeding, and the sword intent of the elders were running rampant in those spots. It was so bad that his ribs were turning to dust.

After Lin Yun sealed his wounds, he circulated his origin energy to expel the sword intent left in his body. When the sword aura stained in blood exited through his pores, his complexion started to turn rosy. Then, the Nirvana Pellet revealed its might and started to heal his injuries rapidly.

“What the hell was that earlier?”

“It was too dazzling, I couldn’t see it clearly…”

“You had the courage to look?” All sorts of exclamations came from the crowd as they looked at the stage where countless swords were lying.

Gongsun Yan was also briefly shocked before he exclaimed, “That’s the genuine holy spirit of the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords!”

The Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords was famous in the Eastern Desolation because someone had once used it to sweep through those in the same generation. Many people were attracted to the Sword Saint Mountain because of that, but it was a pity that not many people had success.

Gongsun Yan was experienced, so he swiftly recalled the origin of the azure sword. As for the members of the Feng Clan, their eyes were dull. They couldn’t say a single word because what happened today was a huge blow to their ego.

At this moment, countless gazes were on Lin Yun, including the hidden experts from far away.

“Three rounds have passed. I should be able to leave with the Lightning Shadow Sword now, right?” Lin Yun took a deep breath as he turned to look at Feng Xuanzi. After coming this far, he had completely fallen out with the Feng Clan and was prepared for the worst.

“We can’t give it to him! The Feng Clan will be doomed if we do!”

“The Lightning Shadow Sword has stayed in our Feng Clan for eighteen years. It’s our signature, and we’ll lose our foundation without it!”

“Pavilion Master, please reconsider!” The Feng Clan’s elders spoke among themselves. They didn’t dare to speak loudly, but their words were still heard by everyone.

Although it was shameless, everyone understood why they were unwilling to hand over the Lightning Shadow Sword. However, they were disputing a rule of the Hidden Sword Manor, it wasn’t something the Feng Clan could disobey.

If the Feng Clan didn’t hand over the Lightning Shadow Sword, it would be a huge blow to the Hidden Sword Manor’s reputation. At that time, not even Feng Xuanzi could bear the rage of the Hidden Sword Manor.

“Young Master Luo, what if Feng Xuanzi doesn’t hand it over?” Bai Ting asked in a worried tone.

“He doesn’t have a choice,” said Luo Hua with a fluctuation in her emotions for once. The fluctuation in her emotions made Bai Ting feel a chill down his spine because he could sense her killing intent.

Just when everyone was waiting for Feng Xuanzi to make the decision, Feng Xuanzi finally spoke, “I have no right to change the rules set by the Hidden Sword Pavilion. But… this is an important matter because my Feng Clan has lost a lot of people and swords. Even my younger brother has died and my Feng Clan needs some time to adjust. What do you think of taking the sword in three days?”

His words instantly disappointed many people. After all, who knew if Lin Yun would still be alive in three days? Then again, they couldn’t fault him because the Feng Clan really did lose a lot of people.

Although Feng Xuanzi didn’t show any fluctuation in his emotions after Feng Tianyuan’s death, everyone knew that a dog who doesn’t bite was the most terrifying.

Lin Yun was briefly stunned before his face was full of disdain. He was completely stunned by Feng Xuanzi’s shamelessness. The Feng Clan didn’t want to hand over the Lightning Shadow Sword and they also didn’t want to be questioned by the Hidden Sword Pavilion. Did Feng Xuanzi think he was a fool?

“Feng Xuanzi, are you done messing around?” Luo Hua’s cold voice sounded out. “Immediately hand over the sword. I don’t wish to repeat myself twice. No more tricks.”

Everyone held their breaths when they heard the tone of Luo Hua’s voice. They were also shocked by her temperament.

Feng Xuanzi’s lips twitched because he was furious. But when he thought about Luo Hua’s origin, he had no choice but to swallow his pride. At the same time, he began to wonder what kind of relationship Luo Hua had with Lin Yun. So he probed, “This is between the Feng Clan and Lin Yun. Young Master Luo, do you have to be involved?”

“Are you really trying to figure out what kind of relationship we have? His business is my business. Anyway, he passed all three rounds, so hand over the sword. He might be willing to talk about the rules with you, but I’m not. If we did things according to my temper, you would be dead right now. Keep in mind that the only reason why you’re still alive is because of him.” Luo Hua’s words made Feng Xuanzi feel a chill down his spine.

The other elders of the Feng Clan looked at Luo Hua with annoyance and fury. They didn’t think that Feng Xuanzi had to be afraid of her, not to mention that the business of the Feng Clan had nothing to do with an outsider.

Lin Yun also looked at Luo Hua and fell into deep thoughts when he heard that.

“Retrieve the sword!” Feng Xuanzi gritted his teeth.

“Pavilion Master!” The Feng Clan’s elders all tried to stop Feng Xuanzi.

“Enough! It’s just a sword. As long as I’m still alive, the Feng Clan won’t fall!” Feng Xuanzi said coldly. Technically speaking, he was correct. As a heavenly spiritualist, the Feng Clan wouldn’t fall as long as he was still around. Then again, it was certain that the Feng Clan would decline after he died in the future because they would no longer have the Lightning Shadow Sword.

Under Feng Xuanzi’s insistence, the Eight Ominous Soul Locking Array that had disappeared into the ground had appeared once more. All of this happened so quickly that no one could react to Feng Xuanzi’s decision.

Feng Xuanzi’s decisiveness made many people wonder about Luo Hua’s origin.

“It’s impossible for a saint clan to subdue the Feng Xuanzi. At the very least, it has to be an ancient saint clan!” Gongsun Yan looked at Luo Hua with fire blazing in the depth of his eyes.

Any clan with a saint would be a saint clan. But only those with a deep foundation that had existed since the chaos era could be called an ancient saint clan. However, there weren’t many sects or clans that lasted through the golden era.

Even though a few of them made occasional appearances, they were all practically legends now. No one really ever saw them and they only existed by rumor like the Mo Clan.

Gongsun Yan looked at Zhao Yan and asked, “Is there an ancient saint clan that goes by the surname Luo?”

“There is, but there’s no one in that clan with her name. There’s also no one in the powerful sects that goes by her name.” Zhao Yan shook his head. Gongsun Yan’s origin was related to the Sword Emperor’s lineage. So if Gongsun Yan had no idea who Luo Hua was, he definitely wouldn’t know either.

Gong Haoran beside the two of them sighed, “Looks like no one will dare to touch Lin Yun with her around. After all, not even the elders from the Sword Emperor’s lineage can change Feng Xuanzi’s mind with just a threat.”

Gongsun Yan was briefly stunned because Gong Haoran was very logical. But for some reason, Gong Haoran’s words were full of jealousy.

Right at this moment, the shackles on the Eight Ominous Soul Locking Array began to snap like an avalanche. When the statues broke apart, the gigantic sword crumbled. An ancient sword hovered in the air that emitted immense pressure despite being sheathed.

There was no question that this was the famous Lightning Shadow Sword. At this moment, Feng Xuanzi’s face became much older as he powerlessly spoke, “Test the sword.”
