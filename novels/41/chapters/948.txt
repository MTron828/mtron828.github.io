Chapter 949 - Well Said!

Since Lin Yun still had ten days left, he wasn’t in a rush to reach the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm. He took his time traveling and fought all the demonic beasts he ran into. It was the perfect time to temper his Divine Glorysun Fist. He was even able to force overlord demonic beasts to retreat after three punches.

Seven days later, Lin Yun was able to see the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm. It was located on an altar and was surrounded by majestic buildings.

With the arrangement of buildings, the altar looked sacred. It looked like there were many powerful sects who protected the altar in the past.

Since the battles from ancient times were extremely brutal, many ruins were left behind. However, the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm was a realm, so there were many things that were preserved.

Lin Yun was looking forward to seeing what ancient times looked like. If he could catch a glimpse of the past and obtain some inheritances in the process, he would’ve fulfilled his objective for the trip. But just like Lin Yun, there were many geniuses who felt the same. So many geniuses from the higher realms were gathered in the city because no one wanted to miss out.

When Lin Yun saw the busy city, he was a little shocked. Lines of people were entering the city from all over.

“The Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm’s appearance really is a grand event. The higher realms are everywhere! I bet that many of the top-tier geniuses from the Azure Dragon Ranking are here too.” Lin Yun could feel his blood boiling.

The scale of the city was huge and far exceeded many cities from various astral lands. But even so, the city was reaching maximum capacity.

Lil’ Red was sitting on Lin Yun’s shoulder with excitement. It loved to be in lively places, but it also had a great deal of caution that was far greater than Lin Yun’s wariness. After all, the cautiousness of a demonic beast was deeply engraved in their bloodline.

If Lin Yun didn’t use his sword intent, he wouldn’t be as sensitive to danger as he currently was Raising his head, Lin Yun looked at the majestic buildings ahead of him. But no matter how high everything was, nothing could compare with the majestic altar. Although the city was extremely crowded, no one dared to get near the shrine. After all, the shrine had become the stronghold of the higher realms.

“We should go down there.” Lin Yun smiled as he pulled down his hood and joined the crowd. The hood was barely able to hide his appearance, but it wasn’t helpful concealing his identity. However, Lin Yun wasn’t concerned with his identity being revealed anymore.

“I heard that there are many treasures in the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm. In addition to the inheritances of the powerful sects from ancient times, there are also some secrets from the Divine Dragon Era. Legend has it that the four regions of the Heavenly Path are related to a colossal sect from ancient times. At their peak, they far exceeded all sects of the current era.”

“Isn’t that a little dramatic?”

“Well, they’re just legends, so who knows if they’re true? But there are definitely a lot of treasures in the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm. With a single treasure, it will be easy to rise in the Heavenly Path.”

“Hehe. You can dream all you want, but don’t you see the higher realms? Do you think you’re Lin Yun? How can you stand against the higher realms?”

“Who knows how many people will show up for the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm. Even some of the higher realms will miss out on treasures. I bet that only the seven heads will shine brightly this time.”

Lin Yun was mixed in with the crowd and heard everyone’s opinions. It seemed like the competition for the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm was a lot more troublesome than he originally thought.

“I heard that the owners of six astral spirits are already at the shrine. The only one left is Lin Yun.”

“Who would have thought that the owner of the Glorymoon Spirit is also from the same realm as Lin Yun. But it seems like the higher realms won’t make things difficult for him since they’re focused on Lin Yun.”

“Lin Yun isn’t just attracting their attention. He’s causing trouble for them. I heard that he snatched a monarch beast core from six higher realms, which drove Mo Yan crazy. Lin Yun is probably the only one in the Azure Dragon Region who can disregard the higher realms.”

“Lin Yun is truly impressive. But I doubt he shows up this time. After all, Liu Mu successfully reached the fourth soul Heavenly Soul Realm. So there are a few higher realms after him now.”

“Yeah. He’s practically public enemy number one right now. After all, he humiliated the higher realms and he has a lot of treasures on him. So there’s no way he’ll appear until the last moment.”RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Lin Yun was stunned by the information he was hearing. He wasn’t surprised that Liu Mu reached the fourth soul Heavenly Soul Realm, but it was still an impressive feat.

Fourth soul Heavenly Soul Realm geniuses weren’t common in the Azure Dragon Region. So it was no surprise that everyone knew about Liu Mu. However, Lin Yun was surprised that people knew he stole the Gold-furred Demonic Ape’s beast core. There was no doubt in Lin Yun’s mind that Mo Yan spread the information and was waiting for him.

Clearly, Lin Yun was in a lot of trouble. So he pulled his hood lower and continued towards the shrine.

As he walked forward, he saw fights breaking out all over the city. Everyone was competing for a better spot while they waited. They had to resort to this method because no one dared to approach the shrine where all the higher realms were gathered. After all, everyone wanted to enter the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm right when it opened.

But Lin Yun didn’t pay attention to anyone. His objective was the shrine.

Furthermore, Lin Yun wasn’t afraid of the Bloodbone Realm. Even if everyone from the Bloodbone Realm ganged up on him, he wouldn’t back down. But all of a sudden, Lin Yun sensed several familiar auras.

In a building close to the shrine, a fight was occurring between two people. One of the figures was from a higher realm and his cultivation was in the third soul Heavenly Soul Realm. His opponent wasn’t from the higher realms, but his cultivation was also in the third soul Heavenly Soul Realm.

It wasn’t hard to guess that the higher realms were trying to chase the group that was occupying the building. It was an interesting scene because no one ever dared to stand against the higher realms.

However, Lin Yun didn’t stop because of the fight. He stopped because he saw several familiar figures, Chen Xuan and Liu Yun.

So the one fighting the leader of the higher realm must be the Highcloud Realm’s leader, Mu Yan. Chen Xuan told him all about Mu Yan. Apparently, Mu Yan had the strength to compete with geniuses on the Azure Dragon Ranking. However, his opponent’s foundation was a lot sturdier than his.

So the outcome of the battle would probably be determined within ten moves. While Lin Yun thought about this, Mu Yan was sent flying.

“Senior brother!” Everyone from the Highcloud Realm felt worried when they saw this. Chen Xuan and Liu Yun even sped forward to help Mu Yan to his feet.

“You dare to compete with my Skyhawk Realm with only this much strength? Mu Yan, you must be tired of living. Do you think a piece of trash like you can occupy this building?” Everyone from the Skyhawk Realm looked at Mu Yan with disdain. Clearly, they had no intention of letting this matter go easily.

“We were here first!” Liu Yun said with fire blazing in his eyes. As soon as they settled into the building, they were attacked by the Skyhawk Realm. If Mu Yan didn’t come in time, the consequences would be even worse.

“First come first served? Does that work in the Heavenly Path? If we can reason things out, why do we need our fists?” The leader of Skyhawk Realm mocked Liu Yun and laughed at the absurdity.

“Well said. If things can be reasoned with words, why would we need our fists?” All of a sudden, a voice interrupted the conversation. When everyone turned around, they saw a figure donned in azure clothes with a hood covering half of his face. It was hard to see his face, but everyone could see the smirk on his face.
