Chapter 1442 - Won't Let The Sword Sect Down!

While everyone was talking, Lin Yun was shocked to see so many people having gathered together and swept his gaze around while hovering in the air.

Lin Yun squinted his eyes with a smile because he knew that the commotion created by him was a little too huge. After his dragon runes grew to five thousand, Lin Yun gave it a try and realized that he could enter the vortex, but could barely withstand the impact.

Over the past thirty days, his cultivation didn’t just reach the one-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm, he had even reached the third stage in the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon. The ancient scripture on the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron reached nearly a thousand characters.

This made the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron heavier. It was so heavy that his one-star heavenly elysium core could no longer suppress it. A small portion of the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron was popping out of the golden ocean of astral energy instead of fully submerging it.

This gave him a headache because the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron would be released if he didn’t pay enough attention to it. It was scary to think about, not to mention that the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron was pretty troublesome to deal with when it didn’t have any resources to devour.

Although the power contained within it was terrifying, it wasn’t something he could control with his current strength. If he wasn’t careful, he would be governed by the killing intent from the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron. Putting it in a nutshell, he would become a vessel of the cauldron.

What Lil’ Purple said about the cauldron wasn’t fake. It was a demonic cauldron born from primal chaos and was filled with mystery. Lin Yun’s Dragon-Phoenix Sword Aura also grew from eighteen to forty-two whisps. If he fought Xiahou Yan, Chen Bing, and Huang Yancheng again, he could defeat them more easily.

“Seems like I stayed in the Saint Pool for a little too long…” Lin Yun muttered while he looked at the shocked faces in the surroundings. Originally, he actually couldn’t stay in the Saint Pool for so long. Even if his dragon runes had grown to five thousand, his physique couldn’t bear the constant impacts. But when the scriptures on the cauldron reached a thousand, Lin Yun was shocked to discover that the scriptures flew from the cauldron and wrapped around him, protecting him from the vortex.

After that, the cauldron began to devour the golden dust at the bottom of the Saint Pool even more ferociously. It was as if the cauldron didn’t want to be disrupted from devouring the golden dust. This made him curious because he couldn’t control those scriptures.

Lin Yun could stay at the bottom of the Saint Pool for another month if he wanted. But that was a little unfair, and Lin Yun wasn’t so shameless. But even so, he scraped off nine layers of the golden dust before coming out.

When Lin Yun flew towards where Mu Chuan was, he noticed six people beside Mu Chuan. There was a grey-clothed old man whose sword aura radiated brightly like a majestic sun in front of the other five people.

“Lin Yun, why aren’t you greeting the sect master and these peak masters?” Mu Chuan’s face was ugly, but he reminded Lin Yun when he saw the latter coming over.

Lin Yun knew that he had blown up the matter after seeing that the sect master was there. Feeling guilty, Lin Yun smiled and cupped his hands, “Disciple Lin Yun greets the sect master and all the peak masters.”

“Looks like the Divine Firmament Peak has another genius now.” Mu Xuankong smiled.

But Mu Chuan interrupted them and asked, “Lin Yun, how much astral saint dust did you refine at the bottom of the Saint Pool?”

“Astral saint dust?” Lin Yun was puzzled when he heard that term.

“The golden dust at the bottom of the Saint Pool. How much did you refine?” Mu Chuan nervously asked.

“Uhh… it’s really hard to say.” Lin Yun scratched his head because he really had no idea how much gold dust he refined. He gulped down a mouthful of saliva and asked in a somewhat flustered tone, “Is it serious? Am I not allowed to touch it? I didn’t know of it beforehand. You won’t ask me to pay for it, right?”

“Hahaha!” Lin Yun amused Mu Xuankong. Lin Yun was too adorable in his eyes. Mu Xuankong smiled, “You don’t have to panic. Don’t be frightened by what your senior brother said. If you can refine them, it’s your own ability. We’re happy to see you grow stronger, so how will we blame you for it? You just have to tell us the truth.”

Hearing what Mu Xuankong said, Lin Yun breathed a sigh of relief and replied, “I really have no idea how much I refined. I only know that I scraped nine layers off…”

The peak masters all took a deep breath when they heard that, and even Mu Xuankong was surprised. It was no wonder why Lin Yun had no idea how much he refined, his measurement scale was by layers. That was equivalent to two hundred years of accumulation from the Divine Firmament Peak!

But in reality, Lin Yun didn’t refine that much himself. He roughly refined five layers while four of the layers were divided between Lil’ Purple and Lil’ Red, respectively. But it was better to count them as his own.

When the group recovered their senses, they all looked at Mu Chuan with strange smiles.

“Is there any problem?” Lin Yun asked weakly.

“Naturally not.” Mu Xuankong smiled. “It’s a reward to you by the sect. Do you know how long Jian Jingtian stayed at the bottom of the Saint Pool?”

“Erm… I don’t…”

“Eighteen days!” Mu Xuankong replied.

Lin Yun was surprised to hear that. He didn’t know that Jian Jingtian was that strong. He was an exception because he relied on the cauldron to stay for a month. So he couldn’t imagine how Jian Jingtian remained at the bottom of the Saint Pool for eighteen days.

“So you’ve done something impressive, lad.” Mu Xuankong looked at Lin Yun with his eyes filled with love for talent.

“I’m just lucky.” Lin Yun humbly replied. He knew he had cheated to obtain this impressive record, so it wasn’t too fair.

“It doesn’t matter what you do because there’s no fluke in this world.” Mu Xuankong deeply glanced at Lin Yun. “No matter what you do, it’s considered part of your strength. Gentlemen, I have a somewhat immature idea. Lin Yun might be young, and his qualifications are still shallow, but the potential he displayed is comparable to Jian Jingtian. So I wish to grant him the identity as a heaven direct disciple. What do you guys think?”

As soon as Mu Xuankong said that, an uproar exploded on the Divine Firmament Peak. “H-How is this possible?”

“Heaven direct disciple? Holy shit. Did I hear that correctly? He’s only been at the sect for a month!”

“Isn’t this a little too unbelievable? Lin Yun is only at the one-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm.”

Everyone in the surroundings was shocked; even Mu Qingqing had her mouth wide open. When she came to her senses, she sourly said, “Isn’t our father a little too biased?”

But Mu Xueqin fell into deep thoughts when she heard what her father said. This wasn’t exactly a piece of good news because it would make Lin Yun become a sore in everyone’s eyes. All the disciples in the Sword Sect were stubborn. They were all arrogant and would draw their swords upon a disagreement.

There were limited quotas for heavenly direct disciples in the sect every year. Aside from those in the top ten of the Heaven Ranking who could become heaven direct disciples, one at least need to possess cultivation in the Dragon Pulse Realm and undergo a series of tests to fight for one of the five quotas.

It was simply unheard of that someone in the Elysium Core Realm could become a heaven direct disciple. It was a glory that not even those in the top ten on the Earth Ranking received.

“Looks like the Sword Sect is going to become real lively…” Mu Xueqin smiled as she looked at Lin Yun from a distance. She could feel that the Sword Sect was starting to change because of his arrival.

Mu Xuankong’s words were shocking, so the other peak masters were stumped and speechless. Mu Chuan was the first to come to his senses. A light flashed through his pupils, and he yelled, “Brat, what are you waiting for? Why aren’t you thanking the sect master?”

His yell startled Lin Yun, and he quickly said, “Disciple Lin Yun thanks the sect master!”

Seeing Lin Yun react so quickly, Mu Chuan smiled and squinted his eyes. He quickly made the decision right away with a laugh, “Great. Since everyone has no opinion about it, you’re a heaven direct disciple starting today!”

The other peak masters only came to their senses now. How could they not have any opinion about that? If Lin Yun became a heaven direct disciple, this meant that one peak would lose their quota. Most importantly, this wasn’t appropriate because Lin Yun was only at the one-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm, while their peaks had disciples on the top ten of the Earth Ranking. Some had even reached the three-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm. So how were they going to explain to those disciples? Just thinking about it alone was enough to give them a headache.

So the peak masters were all unhappy as they turned to look at Mu Chuan. That fellow looked like he wanted to hack Lin Yun just a moment ago. But now, he was the first to react and got Lin Yun to thank the sect master before they could have a chance to speak, and this was simply too shameless.

Looking at Lin Yun, Mu Xuankong was happy as he continued, “I know you’ve suffered a lot of grievances on the Heavenly Path. You’ve walked to the end, but none of the powerful sects in the Ancient Barren Domain wanted you. You might’ve been taken in by Martial Uncle Radiant, but you can be reassured. The Sword Sect won’t let you suffer any grievances, and what happened to Jian Jingtian eighteen years ago will never happen to you. As long as you’re a disciple of the Sword Sect, we won’t let anyone bully you.”

When Lin Yun raised his head to look at Mu Xuankong’s eyes, the soft spot in his heart was struck. He had been wandering around since he left the Sword Firmament Pavilion and had never settled in a place. But he could feel an emotion he had never felt before after hearing what Mu Xuankong said.

Everyone knew that he was Flower Burial, the strongest genius on the Heavenly Paths. Everyone knew he was strong since he killed five and crippled five of the Realm Sons back on the Ninth Heavenly Path. But no one cared how lonely he felt, and he couldn’t show his weakness because he had nothing behind him. So he couldn’t afford to collapse.

As a sour sensation rose in Lin Yun’s nose, he sobbed and bit on his lips, not wanting to let his tears roll down his cheeks. “Disciple Lin Yun thanks the sect master!”

Lin Yun didn’t say much, but he had made up his mind. He wouldn’t let the Sword Sect down in this lifetime.Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎
