Chapter 1066 - Repaying Humiliation A Hundred Fold!

When the seal enclosing the Saint Spiritual Lake opened, the violent spiritual energy and stars began to radiate. The atmosphere became dreamy as dense spiritual energy filled the air. In just one moment, everyone felt their pores open while their origin energy started to boil.

“The Saint Spiritual Lake!” The hearts of everyone on the ranking began to throb violently before they charged towards the lake. Suddenly, a series of breaking noises rang out.

“Don’t move!” Luo Chen stopped Qin Lin, Jun Mengchen, and Lin Yun’s friends.

But the others around them charged towards the lake and were crushed by an immense aura. When they raised their heads, fear filled their eyes because the Realm Sons were hovering above them in the sky.

Every single one of them was emitting an immense aura from their bodies along with a brilliant radiance. Their aura alone had already suppressed all the geniuses who soared into the sky. In fact, the auras of everyone who was suppressed had practically crumbled.

It was a silent reminder that the Realm Sons were here and that they would enter the Saint Spiritual Lake first. The warning instantly quelled everyone’s excitement as they looked at the Realm Sons.

“How overbearing!” Qin Lin’s eyes flashed with indignance when he saw the blatant disdain on the Nether Divinity Realm Son’s face.

“Quiet down,” said Luo Chen coldly.

“Am I wrong? If Brother Lin Yun was here, there would be no room for the Nether Divinity Realm Son. Brother Lin’s name is clearly still on the ranking, but that guy is going around saying that Lin Yun is dead. He acts like he’s the one who defeated Brother Lin,” said Qin Lin in a disdainful tone.

Qin Lin was someone who would speak up if he was unhappy. In this situation, he couldn’t accept the fact that the Realm Sons were looking down on everyone, not to mention their attitude in the Yellow Sandy Plain. Although the Realm Sons weren’t there, they were the ones who made it difficult for Qin Lin to pass.

It was fine if they were strong, but the three Realm Sons relied on a trap to deal with Lin Yun. They even sent their servants to their deaths while using a girl to threaten Lin Yun. In the end, the war realms were nothing but losers, especially the Nether Divinity Realm Son who was slapped by Lin Yun.

Luo Chen fell into silence. It was clear that Lin Yun’s name was still shining brightly on the ranking, which meant that he was still alive. However, they also knew that it was impossible for Lin Yun to come back. Since the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm’s entrance closed, Lin Yun was trapped

Luo Chen and the others even circled the palace several times to find a way to reopen the entrance. However, each trip ended in failure.

“Those people are petty, so we better give up when the final battle starts,” said Luo Chen with his brows locked together.

“I’m just complaining right now. I won’t do anything rash.” Qin Lin sighed in disappointment because he knew that he couldn’t do anything. The Realm Sons were too strong.

The ten Realm Sons descended onto the Saint Spiritual Lake to occupy the best locations. When the ten of them descended, everyone who was waiting began to charge forward. Luo Chen and his group managed to take the corner position of the Saint Spiritual Lake, which submerged them up to their chest.

Then, their faces changed drastically because their cultivation was rapidly rising. At this moment, they concentrated on absorbing the golden sparkles that were entering their bodies. Everyone could sense their cells swelling as their physiques underwent a transformation. In just a single breath’s time, explosive power filled their bodies.

“How unbelievable,” said Luo Chen, who raised his hand with a grave expression. He long heard rumors that the Saint Spiritual Lake could allow someone to undergo a drastic transformation that would boost their strength if their foundation was sturdy enough.

The golden sparkles that Luo Chen was refining came from the Nine-Leaf Saint Fruit that was rumored to be located in the depth of the Saint Spiritual Lake. The leaf would bloom once every millennium and would mature after all nine leaves fully bloomed. It was the reason why the Saint Spiritual Lake was so magical. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

With such a great boost in strength at the border of the lake, Luo Chen couldn’t imagine how great the boost would be at the center of the lake. But with the Realm Sons occupying the middle, no one dared to move. On top of that, the servants of the Realm Sons were preventing anyone from getting close to the middle.

With the greatest resources in the Saint Spiritual Lake occupied by the Realm Sons, the other geniuses could only cultivate at the border of the lake. Although they would become strong, the Realm Sons would become even stronger because of where they were cultivating.

Just thinking about it made Luo Chen feel despair. He knew that even if Lin Yun could make it out of the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm, he wouldn’t be able to compete with the Realm Sons anymore.

“Unbelievable. I can sense that I will reach the fifth soul Heavenly Soul Realm in three days,” said Qin Lin with joy flashing in his pupils. Even the other geniuses were rejoicing in excitement.

Luo Chen merely sighed inwardly and didn’t say a word. After everyone’s initial joy for entering the Saint Spiritual Lake, the surroundings grew quiet. Everyone was focusing on refining the golden sparkles in the lake.

The process wasn’t as smooth as everyone imagined. Half a day later, many people had no choice but to stop because they noticed that the number of golden sparkles had decreased. Now, they could only refine ten golden sparkles in six hours.

Two days later, the majority of the people had woken up because they realized that there weren’t any more golden sparkles. Even so, everyone had a great boost in their strength along with a breakthrough in their cultivation. Luckily, everyone’s strength had doubled.

However, they were all looking at the center of the Saint Spiritual Lake with disappointment. The Realm Sons were glowing with golden radiance while golden sparkles enveloped them in the air.

“Damn it!” Qin Lin cursed because he was trapped in the bottleneck of the fourth soul Heavenly Soul Realm. He was half a step away from making a breakthrough to the fifth soul, but there was nothing he could do since all the golden sparkles had been exhausted.

On the other hand, Luo Chen was calm because he had already predicted this situation. The Saint Spiritual Lake had greatly boosted his strength and allowed his body to undergo a transformation. However, he didn’t bother with his cultivation and focused on transforming his physique.

Additionally, Luo Chen could sense a dao rhyme in the lake. The Nine-Leaf Saint Fruit was a thousand year-old saint herb, so it definitely had a powerful dao. It was a shame that he couldn’t comprehend the dao rhyme from where he was submerged. Only the Realm Sons could do so. Right at this moment, a commotion rang out on the Saint Spiritual Lake as everyone watched a rainbow glow appear behind the Realm Sons.

“My heavens! Not only did they have a great boost in their strength, but their martial intents also transformed!”

“It seems like their holy spirits are transforming too…”

“Unbelievable, just how did they manage to do it?” Many people’s faces changed upon seeing this because they were shocked by the phenomena surrounding the ten Realm Sons. The effects of the Saint Spiritual Lake weren’t just limited to one’s cultivation and physique, but it also extended to the dao rhyme.

Suddenly, the entire world began to tremble. The Nether Divinity Realm Son was the first to open his eyes as he made his breakthrough into the sixth soul Heavenly Soul Realm. When his tribulation began to form, bewitching flowers descended from the sky.

“Demonic Astral Flowers!” Many people’s faces changed when they saw this scene. It seemed like the Nether Divinity Realm Son wanted to subdue the Demonic Astral Flowers. After all, the fact that Lin Yun had more Demonic Astral Flowers left a scar in his heart.

If it wasn’t for the Demonic Astral Flowers, the slap from Lin Yun wouldn’t have sent him flying. Since Lin Yun had a total of eight Demonic Astral Flowers, he wanted to obtain nine.

So even if Lin Yun made it out of the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm, the Nether Divinity Realm Son could suppress him and repay the humiliation he suffered.
