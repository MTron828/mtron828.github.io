Chapter 865 - Heavenly Path!

The Ancient Southern Domain had obtained a total of four quotas, which surprised Lin Yun. He didn’t think that anyone aside from Yue Weiwei would make it through the test. However, Zhu Qingshan and Yu Haotian surpassed his expectations. It was good that Zhu Qingshan made it because Lin Yun had a good relationship with him, but Yu Haotian was troublesome.

Could it be that he would have to face Yu Haotian again in the Heavenly Path? Just when Lin Yun was in deep thoughts, he sensed someone’s gaze. When he raised his head, he saw Yu Haotian looking at him. But when Lin Yun looked at Yu Haotian, he could see that Yu Haotian was fearless.

“The eight of you can find somewhere close by to rest. Don’t go far because there will be a surprise at night,” said the Sacred Alliance elders before they left. The top of the mountain was massive. In addition to the majestic palaces were many teleportation arrays, prayer mats, and a star observation stage.

Lin Yun was somewhat exhausted from the battles, so he found a place to rest. Then, Lil’ Red ran over happily.

“Hehe, what an adorable cat.” Yue Weiwei walked over and chuckled as she looked at Lil’ Red.

“Cat?” Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts because Lil’ Red really looked like a fat cat now.

“Did you hear about the battle of fate?” Yue Weiwei asked as she sat down.

Lin Yun was naturally baffled. However, once Yue Weiwei explained everything to him, his eyes started to flicker. He found it interesting because it really felt like a battle of fate. His Azure Firmament Sword Sutra was created by Jian Wuya. Jian Wuya and Jian Wuming’s names were similar, and it was possible that they were both related to the Sword Sect.

“However, it doesn’t end with just Zhong Xuan and Yan Mo’s death,” said Yue Weiwei with a grave expression.

Lin Yun fell into a brief thoughts before he quickly said, “Yu Haotian!”

The Sword Sect’s annihilation was related to the Indigomoon Elysium, Mountain Western Domain, and Gauze Eastern Domain. The Mountain Western Domain and the Gauze Eastern Domain’s fortunes were severed by him, but Yu Haotian was still around.

“Things that involve fate are troublesome. If you can’t resolve it, it will affect you greatly. Only one of you can emerge from the Heavenly Path. I believe you can also sense it,” said Yue Weiwei.

Lin Yun did have the feeling that some force was pushing him from behind.

“There’s already a lot of trouble to enter the Heavenly Path. The Heavenly Path is a place where geniuses of countless realms gather. Yan Mo might be nothing compared to them,” said Yue Weiwei. “According to my understanding, the Profound Amber Realm is ranked in one of the lowest positions compared to other realms. It will be a brutal competition without any rules.”

Looking at Yue Weiwei’s grave expression, Lin Yun nodded his head because he had never treated the Heavenly Path lightheartedly. He knew that he wasn’t invincible and that there was no shortage of geniuses in the Heavenly Path. His aptitude might not be comparable to them, but with them as his grinding stone, he could become even stronger.

“Hehe. Big Brother Yun, did I scare you?” Looking at Lin Yun’s grave expression, Yue Weiwei chuckled. “The competition might be dangerous, but it’s also filled with opportunities. If you’re lucky, you might even be accepted as an inner disciple or a core disciple by the powerful sects.”

Forget being a core disciple, Lin Yun would be happy if he could even become an inner disciple. After all, even if Nangong Wanyu, Mu Han, and the others could arrive in the Kunlun Realm, they wouldn’t be able to obtain the powerful sects’ acknowledgement.

“Big Brother Yun’s fortune has always been good, so you don’t have to be too worried,” smiled Yue Weiwei.

Fortune? Of course, Lin Yun believed in fortune, but it was too vague. Compared to fortune, he would rather believe in the sword in his hand. Compared to fortune and resources, he was more concerned about his heart as a swordsman.

Boundless dangers also represented boundless opportunities. He wanted to use his sword to make himself stronger. Lin Yun and Yue Weiwei continued chatting as the sky became dark. Next to them, Lil’ Red stared at the big sky.

As night appeared, a beautiful scene unfolded. The stars in the starry sky were boundless and stirred the origin energy within their bodies. Is this the surprise Gao Zhangtian spoke about?

The starlight shined down from the starry sky for them to absorb. The current situation was unbelievable because everyone knew that only empyreans could absorb starlight and refine it into astral energy. However, there was still a difference because the astral energy they absorbed was directly extracted by empyreans.

Before Lin Yun thought about anything else, he shut his eyes and circulated his Azure Firmament Sword Sutra. With boundless astral energy pouring into his body, Lin Yun could sense that the bottleneck of the sixth stage’s Azure Firmament Sword Sutra was loosening.

Beside him, Lil’ Red became anxious because it couldn’t absorb the astral energy. Looking at this scene, Yue Weiwei smiled, “Come here.”

In the end, Lil’ Red walked over. When it got close, Yue Weiwei pointed her finger at Lil’ Red’s forehead. Then, a demonic beast’s cultivation technique flowed into Lil’ Red’s head. A brief moment later, Lil’ Red opened its eyes with a demonic flame flickering in its pupils. It was showing signs that it was about to transform.

It already possessed a trace of a true dragon’s bloodline, so obtaining this cultivation technique was akin to giving wings to a tiger. At this moment, Lil’ Red’s head felt stuffed because the cultivation technique was so immense. It didn’t know how to thank Yue Weiwei.

Basking in the starlight, Yue Weiwei’s charming temperament became even clearer. With a smile, she rubbed Lil’ Red’s forehead, “You don’t have to thank me. Remember to protect Big Brother Lin, alright? He’s too prideful, so he’ll suffer a loss in the Heavenly Path. Don’t let him get bullied.”

Yue Weiwei’s tone sounded worried. When Lil’ Red nodded its head, Yue Weiwei smiled, “Don’t go back on our promise then. If I know Big Brother Yun suffered a loss, let me think…roast, fried, boiled, steamed…I have a hundred ways to cook you.”

When Lil’ Red heard that, it began to tremble in fear as it nodded its head. Lil’ Red never expected that this beautiful girl would be so terrifying. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Hehe, how obedient. The cultivation of Demonic Clan’s Saint isn’t that easy to obtain. Go ahead and cultivate,” smiled Yue Weiwei.

Very quickly, Lil’ Red sat beside Lin Yun and absorbed the astral energy from the sky.

When morning arrived, Lin Yun opened his eyes as light flashed in them. He was only one step away from making a breakthrough in the Azure Firmament Sword Sutra. At this moment, there were almost 100 green pearls hovering around him.

“What is this?” Lin Yun took one of them and found that it was similar to astral pearls.

“They’re Astral Pellets. The astral energy yesterday was so large that you couldn’t refine all of them with your cultivation. Because of your sword sutra, the astral energy got refined into pellets,” said Yue Weiwei as she seemed to have woken up early.

“I see…” Lin Yun waved his hand and stored the Astral Pearls.

“There’s a limit to the astral energy you can absorb on the Profound Amber Mountain. It can only be done on certain days, once a month. But it’s different in the Heavenly Path. The environment there is so special that not even Kunlun Realm can compare to it,” said Yue Weiwei.

At this moment, Lil’ Red completed its cultivation and spat out a breath, which attracted Lin Yun’s attention. Lin Yun was shocked because Lil’ Red went from the size of his palm to the size of his arm. Furthermore, Lil’s Red’s pupils were filled with a domineering aura as it wore a smirk.

“What the hell?” Lin Yun was shocked.

“I gave it a cultivation technique from the Demonic Clan. It looks like it’s talent isn’t bad,” smiled Yue Weiwei as she rubbed Lil’ Red’s head. The domineering aura coming from Lil’ Red disappeared and it started trembling before closing its eyes like a cat.

“Looks like you’re fated with it. If you want, you can have it,” said Lin Yun, seeing that Yue Weiwei was so fond of Lil’ Red that she even gave it a cultivation technique from the Demon Clan.

No! Lil’ Red suddenly opened its eyes and tried to run. But just when it was about to run away, Yue Weiwei held it by its ears and smiled, “Did you hear that? Big Brother Yun wants to give you to me.”

Steam, roast, fried, boiled… Lil’ Red instantly became desperate. Clearly, Yue Weiwei was just teasing it and soon placed it down. When Lin Yun saw this scene, he smiled. Lil’ Red’s initial form looked more and more like a mix of a dragon and a cat.

Everyone else on Profound Amber Mountain opened their eyes and greeted each other. When Lin Yun looked around, he saw that everyone else had less than 50 Astral Pellets. Only one other person had a similar number of Astral Pellets to Lin Yun. Dusk arrived and the Sacred Alliance elders quickly appeared.

Gao Zhangtian began to speak to everyone, “The Heavenly Path is an ancient path that was around when the ancient era came to an end. It’s a mysterious battlefield filled with mystery. It used to be complete, but it has been broken into nine pieces. This means that everything you do will be a competition!

“The opportunities there will exceed all of your imaginations. I believe none of you need me to tell you about the dangers there.”

Lin Yun wore a grave expression because he already expected the Heavenly Path to be dangerous. No one in their right mind would dare to be careless. When night fully enveloped the sky, the ancient path Lin Yun had seen in the past appeared in the starry sky once more.

“Activate the teleportation array!” The faces of Gao Zhangtian and the others changed as their gazes became grave. A boundless dragon flew out of their bodies, which caused the entire Profound Amber Mountain to tremble violently.

“Enter the array!” With the Sacred Alliance elders barking, everyone entered the array. Lin Yun scooped up Lil’ Red and also entered the array. After everyone entered the array, a majestic light shot into the sky.

A brief moment later, the light dissipated as did Lin Yun and the others. Gao Zhangtian and the Sacred Alliance elders looked at the sky without uttering a single word.

With the Heavenly Path’s arrival, a new era would soon arrive. Everyone had to depend on themselves for the opportunities that were coming.
