Chapter 727 - All Present!

Now, there were five people who passed the tests, but they were part of the seven geniuses. As for the rest of the crowd, they had become spectators. Clearly, only the seven geniuses belonged on the stage.

But once the test resumed, an even more brutal scene appeared before everyone. Some geniuses made it up the stage by luck, but the seven geniuses would kick them out. “You think you’re qualified to stand with us? Get lost!”

Before the lucky few who made it onto the stage could catch their breath, five of the seven geniuses would kick them off the stage. This not only inflicted more injuries on those who made it through the test, but it also humiliated them.

However, the elders of the three overlord forces wore an indifferent expression at this. Perhaps, in their view, this was part of the test. Only those who could stand on the stage ultimately could enter their eyes. This scene instantly caused a commotion.

Right at this moment, the two remaining geniuses, Chu Muyan and Chen Ziyu also stood up. They instantly became the center of everyone’s attention.

“Brother Chen, I’m curious to see which stage you will pick,” smiled Chu Muyan.

“I’m picking the same one as you,” smiled Chen Ziyu.

“Is that so?” Then, Chu Muyan and Chen Ziyu disappeared. When they reappeared, they were enveloped by a purple moon. Both of them picked the Indigomoon Elysium. This instantly made the atmosphere tense as the crowd still remembered how everyone grew old and died.

Just when everyone was getting worried for Chu Muyan and Chen Ziyu, a torrential aura exploded from their bodies. One of them was enveloped in a cold fog and every step he took would unleash great pressure like a lofty mountain. The other one was blazing with flames and he left burning footprints with every step he took.

“Frost intent!” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Flame intent!” Exclamations came from the crowd in response to Chu Muyan and Chen Ziyu having comprehended martial intents. When the moonlight landed on Chen Ziyu, the light couldn’t even penetrate through the fog around him. As for Chu Muyan, the moonlight was being incinerated by the flames around him.

Both of them relied on their martial intent to resist the moonlight, causing a loud cheer from the crowd. This also caused the elders of the three forces to look at them.

“Not bad.” Qing Ruoyou spoke from the Indigomoon Elysium’s seat and continued, “I rarely praise anyone, but you two aren’t bad. Even in the Indigomoon Elysium, the two of you will shine brightly.”

“Thank you for your praise, Your Highness Ruoyou.” Chen Ziyu and Chu Muyan rejoiced as it was rare for someone to receive Qing Ruoyou’s praise. The reason for this, however, was largely because of Lin Yun’s death.

“Looks like that sword slave really attracts a lot of hatred that Her Highness Ruoyou would praise us.”

“Well done! If we can receive her father’s personal guidance, it’ll be a great fortune for us!” Chu Muyan and Chen Ziyu exchanged a glance, unable to conceal the joy on their faces.

“They’re finally all present…” Lin Yun’s face was dark beneath the mask. He was determined to take revenge for the day when he was suppressed by the Profound Note Bell, mocked by the seven geniuses, and forced to watch Lil’ Red sacrifice itself to save him. Since then, he had no intention of letting the seven of them off.

But just when Lin Yun was about to make a move, someone got through the Heavenly Demon Pavilion’s test. It was Yang Fan. He got through the test after nine palms from the statue and his face was currently pale.

But the moment he landed on the stage, a bolt of lightning flashed over and kicked him. It was Ouyang Hao who kicked Yang Fan’s knee and made him kneel on the ground. Bearing the pain, Yang Fan squeezed out a smile, “Did the two of you recognize the wrong person? I’m Yang Fan, ranked forty-seven on the outer ranking. I have some connections with a few of the disciples from your clan.”

He thought that these two would kick him out of the stage, but he was ultimately a genius on the outer ranking. Therefore, he thought that they would more or less give him some face.

“Connection? Who has connections with you? What I remember is that you were pretty close to that sword slave, right?”

“It’s fine if you’re a genius on the inner ranking. But trash on the outer ranking like you dares to stand before us?” Qin Xu and Ouyang Hao sneered. Their words made Skymound City’s geniuses smile as if they were the ones mocking Yang Fan. After all, they were happy to see geniuses not from Skymound City embarrass themselves.

“I’ll get down myself then…” Yang Fan’s face had turned pale from the humiliation as he struggled to get down.

“Let me send you off instead!” Qin Xu sneered as his right hand transformed into a demonic ape’s arm. When his arm lashed out on Yang Fan’s face, it made Yang Fan throw up blood and his teeth fly out.

“You guys!” Guo Xu came forward to help Yang Fan up with rage written on his face.

“Get lost!” Ouyang Hao raised his brow as he looked at Guo Xu with killing intent flickering in his pupils. Guo Xu didn’t dare to utter a word as he gnashed his teeth and took Yang Fan away.

“Well done!” The disciples of the various forces cheered at this scene, while geniuses not from the city trembled in fear and shook their heads.

At this moment, anyone could tell that the seven geniuses wouldn’t let anyone else on the stage. On top of that, the three forces had actually ignored their actions. This scene made everyone’s heart turn cold.

“Excuse me.” A white-clothed figure squeezed out of the crowd and stood at the front.

When Guo Xu walked past him, he warned, “Brother, it’s best if you don’t go there. They’re a bunch of bastards.”

“You’re right.” Lin Yun paused briefly and looked at Yang Fan who was heavily injured before turning to Guo Xu who had rage written all over his face.

The seven geniuses were indeed bastards and he was here to take their lives. So under Guo Xu’s surprised gaze, Lin Yun walked out of the crowd and instantly became the center of attention.

This shocked everyone because they thought that no one would dare to participate in the test anymore. But someone actually still dared to participate. Is this guy not afraid of death?

Lin Yun swept his glance out before he headed towards the Heavenly Demon Pavilion.

“Another one came out to die.”

“Looks like we’re too easy on them.” Guo Xu and Ouyang Hao sneered sinisterly with killing aura flashing in their eyes.
