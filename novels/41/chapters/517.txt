Chapter 518 - Monstrous Talent

While Lin Yun chatted with Bai Yi and Gong Ming, a few people were talking about him in the Gracecloud Hall. The shock brought along by Lin Yun’s Infernal Mountain and River Painting was greater than he could have imagined.

There were two people studying the Infernal Mountain and River Painting created by Lin Yun. One of them was Mo Ling and the other was naturally Elder Yu Mu. Next to them, Liu Yunyan also had doubt in her eyes.

“Is this really his first time seeing the Infernal Mountain and River Painting?” Yu Mu couldn’t conceal the shock in her eyes when she looked at the painting. Lin Yun’s monstrous talent was too terrifying and Lin Yun’s talent was comparable to some legendary ancestors of their academy.

But right now in the Ancient Southern Domain, they probably couldn’t find someone whose talent could compare with Lin Yun. Perhaps only in those overlord forces would there be monstrous talents like Lin Yun, but there definitely weren’t many.

“Elder Yu, I can be sure that this is his first time seeing the Infernal Mountain and River Painting. Do you know why?” Mo Ling said with a grave expression.

“Why?” Elder Yu was close to the Heavenly Soul Realm. But this still felt too unbelievable to her. This was why she doubted that Lin Yun hadn’t seen the Infernal Mountain and River Painting before. Otherwise, it would be hard to explain how Lin Yun could accomplish such a feat in his first try.

But Mo Ling said that she was sure this was Lin Yun’s first time seeing the Infernal Mountain and River Painting. Not only did this arouse the curiosity of Yu Mu, but also Liu Yunyan. They both wanted to know what made Mo Ling think that.

“Elder Yu, please look at this wind spiritual rune.” Mo Ling pointed her finger at the sole wind spiritual rune in the painting.

“This is…” Yu Mu also felt that this spiritual rune was peculiar, but she couldn’t explain it. “This is the Cloudgather Rune among wind spiritual runes. But at the same time, it doesn’t seem like it.”

“That’s right. This is indeed, the Cloudgather Rune. But this is one that I’ve modified. That means that there was no way he could come in contact with this spiritual rune in the past, so he picked it up on the spot,” smiled Mo Ling.

“Before he drew the Infernal Mountain and River Painting, he closed his eyes for fifteen minutes. I believe he must have been recalling back to how I drew the Cloudgather Rune.” Before Mo Ling began her lecture, she created five spiritual runes of different attributes to shock everyone. It made the sky turn dark with a wild gale. Among the five spiritual runes was this Cloudgather Rune, which meant that Lin Yun had imprinted it in his mind.

“This…” Yu Mu and Liu Yunyan’s faces changed with shock when they heard Mo Ling’s explanation. It was a little too incredible. Lin Yun had only taken a look to copy a second grade spiritual rune modified by Mo Ling?

“So I can be sure that this is his first time seeing the Infernal Mountain and River Painting and that he copied it on the spot. Some of the second grade spiritual runes even look crude,” explained Mo Ling. She was also shocked. Furthermore, the shock she felt was even greater since she had witnessed it on the spot.

“Actually, that’s not the most terrifying part about him,” sighed Mo Ling as she looked at the Infernal Mountain and River Painting.

“What do you mean?” Liu Yunyan and Yu Mu’s curiosity were both piqued.

“He copied every spiritual rune on the spot from me, and even the style is the same. But the Infernal Mountain and River Painting created by him is unique. He’s someone who doesn’t like to follow the path given to him by others. He’s someone who wants to walk his own unique path that solely belongs to him. Elder Yu, your attainments in spiritual runes might be stronger than him, but I’m afraid that even you don’t dare to add a wind spiritual rune into the Infernal Mountain and River Painting…” said Mo Ling after a brief pause.

What she said was disrespectful to Elder Yu, but Elder Yu wasn’t bothered by it as she smiled bitterly, “That’s indeed the case. Most spiritualists are like me, walking the path left to us by our predecessors. After all, the path of spiritual runes isn’t an easy one, so it’s extremely difficult trying to walk our own path. Not to mention modifying the spiritual diagram left to us by our ancestors.”

Nodding her head, Mo Ling turned to Liu Yunyan, “Junior Sister Liu, what do you think about him since you’ve interacted with him the longest?”

Liu Yunyan was briefly stunned as she recalled what happened back in the Indigocloud Lake. She spoke out, “He’s a person of loyalty, but at the same time, he’s also a petty person. He’ll definitely take revenge on anyone who steps on his tail and he definitely won’t go easy on them.”

Liu Yunyan paused briefly before she spoke with a grave expression, “I know that he knows some spiritual runes, but even I’m surprised that he has such talent in spiritual runes. As for what senior sister said about him not wanting to confine himself in the path of others, I can confirm that since his Aquaselenic Sword has reached the Manifestation Stage.”

Both Mo Ling and Mu Yu were shocked when they heard that. To be able to train his sword technique to the Manifestation Stage meant that Lin Yun had obtained his own comprehension. It wasn’t difficult to understand why Lin Yun wanted to modify the Infernal Mountain and River Painting. That was just in his nature. Someone like him would either be unheard of or shake the world.

The three chatted briefly before Mo Ling stored the painting carefully. On the other hand, Liu Yunyan wanted to say something, but she hesitated. In the end, she mustered up her courage, “Senior Sister Mo, you promised to teach me the lesser divine ability once I became a third grade spiritualist…”

“I did say that, but I also said that you needed to grasp ten third grade spiritual runes,” said Mo Ling.

“But there isn’t any time left. I wish to give it a try,” said Liu Yunyan as she bit on her lips.

“How do you want me to teach without grasping ten third grade spiritual runes? You don’t even have the qualification to observe the divine ability,” said Mo Ling indifferently.

“But I wish to give it a try…”

“Go down. I’ll naturally look for you once you grasp ten third grade spiritual runes,” replied Mo Ling. She had no intentions of giving in.

Although Liu Yunyan was filled with reluctance, she could only leave seeing the indifference on Mo Ling’s face. On the other side, Yu Mu wanted to say something, but she ultimately kept her mouth shut.

Mo Ling was already accommodating enough. In truth, you needed to grasp twenty third grade spiritual runes to try and cultivate a divine ability. Otherwise, the consequences would be dire.

After Liu Yunyan left, Yu Mu sighed, “She’s a little too stubborn. She ignored the dangers this time and obtained three Indigoflame Goldlotuses. She’s probably trying to make up for her father’s regret and disgrace back then…”

Mo Ling looked at Yu Mu, and she placed a finger on her lips. This made Yu Mu’s face change because she recalled that Liu Yunyan could still listen to their conversation. Near the gate, Liu Yunyan’s eyes became watery when she heard those words.

After Liu Yunyan left, Mo Ling spoke out, “Elder Yu, Lin Yun is only eighteen if I remember correctly, right?”

Yu Mu smiled, “I know what you want to say. Senior Brother Tang also has the same thoughts. He tasked me to observe him secretly, but I never expected that lad to attract your attention so quickly. But…” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“But what?” responded Mo Ling.

“Lin Yun injured your elder cousin and he had also offended you that day,” said Yu Mu carefully.

Mo Ling raised her brow and smiled, “You’re being too sensitive. That fellow is arrogant and it would be weird if I have a good opinion about him, but what Junior Sister Liu said is right. We don’t have much time left and he might be the key to our academy.

“As for my elder cousin, he was just a piece of trash back in the clan. The clan wanted to make use of my position in the academy to give him a position so that he doesn’t waste the clan’s resources.”

Yu Mu smiled bitterly because Mo Ling was really direct. All the elders knew why Mo Feng wanted to be a guest deacon. If it wasn’t for Lin Yun, they wouldn’t be too bothered by it due to Mo Ling. After all, Mo Ling was someone who grasped a lesser divine ability and she might even take over the entire academy in the future.

“That’s good then. I don’t have any concerns now,” smiled Yu Mu because she was glad that Mo Ling could be so understanding. “I’ll entrust you to train that lad. His talent is truly monstrous, but he’s lacking in guidance.”

“I’ll naturally do my best since I’ve accepted the task.”

“Very well. Also, if you can’t hold him, you can try to tempt him with a divine ability if needed.”

“This…” Mo Ling was shocked because she never expected that from Yu Mu.

“We can’t lose anymore. If he’s really that talented, then we need to take the bet. I believe Senior Brother Tang will agree to it as well,” sighed Yu Mu with a grave expression.

“I understand.” Mo Ling nodded her head. As for Lin Yun, he still had no idea what to expect, but something so important was decided without him knowing.

“Let me have the painting. I’ll let Senior Brother Tang take a look at it and then I’ll return it to you tomorrow,” said Yu Mu as she took the painting from Mo Ling before she left.
