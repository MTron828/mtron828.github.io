Chapter 505 - Promise!

Lin Yun’s appearance left everyone in disbelief. Not only Pan Yue, Han Fei, and Ye Cangming, but also the Heavenly Province Academy’s disciples and Liu Yunyan. They all witnessed how Lin Yun was sent flying by the Indigo Thunderpython before he ran in the opposite direction with the lotuses.

At that time, he was clearly trying to lure the python to another place before his death so that he wouldn’t implicate Liu Yunyan and the rest. So how did Lin Yun survive the pursuit of a greater Yin stage overlord demonic beast when he was only in the quasi-Violet Palace Realm? But Lin Yun had done the impossible by appearing before everyone.

“Big Brother Lin!” Bai Yi cheered out happily. Even the Heavenly Province Academy’s disciples all had excitement on their faces.

“Flower Burial, Lin Yun!”

“He actually survived. Holy shit!”

Even Liu Yunyan also had joy and shock on her face as she spoke up, “You’re actually alive?”

“Aren’t they intending to get revenge? How can I die if they’re like that?” Smiled Lin Yun as he gently patted on Lil’ Red to stand in front of the Heavenly Province Academy’s party. He then swept his gaze at Pan Yue, Han Fei, and Ye Cangming with a playful gaze.

The faces of the three paled as they took several steps back. Lin Yun’s sword technique back in the lake had left a deep impression on them and they didn’t want to recall that experience.

“So, who wants revenge,” smiled Lin Yun as he raised his eyebrow. The three of them were gnashing their teeth in their current dilemma.

“I do. You think you’re great? So what?” Ye Cangming was the first to stand out. He was a wandering cultivator, so he was used to being rampant. He barked, “Lin Yun, don’t take it too far. Otherwise, I won't let you have an easy time even if I die!”

He was a wandering cultivator, so he naturally had his means. Normally, a sect’s disciple wouldn’t be so hard-headed. It was truly a pity that he ran into Lin Yun.

The moment he finished speaking, blood splattered from his brows and they noticed that Lin Yun was already holding onto the Flower Burial Sword. Blood was dripping down from the sword and the sound of the blood dripping on the ground could be heard by everyone.

Lin Yun’s sword was too fast, so no one could see how he attacked. Even Liu Yunyan, Pan Yue, and the other experts could only sense a blurred sword ray streaking before them. As for the rest, they didn’t even notice it until they saw the sword in Lin Yun’s hand.

Ye Cangming, who was still threatening Lin Yun a second ago, was lying dead on the ground. He couldn’t even react. Ye Cangming only had a chance when Lin Yun was only in the quasi-Violet Palace Realm. Unfortunately for him, Lin Yun had already undergone a transformation.

Pan Yue and Han Fei were trembling in fear as they kneeled on the ground begging for their lives. They knew that there was no way they could take Lin Yun’s attack head-on. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

But right at this moment, the ground began to tremble from a violent aura. The next thing they knew, a demonic aura was sweeping over everyone.

“This is…” The faces of Liu Yunyan and the rest changed.

Pan Yue and Han Fei’s hearts both jolted before joy filled their faces, “Lin Yun, you’re finished!”

They didn’t have any fear on their faces at this moment and they were prepared to attack. The moment they finished speaking, a colossal rat appeared in everyone’s eyes.

“It’s the king!” That gigantic rat was naturally the Draconian Rockrat’s king that was emitting an aura in the greater Yin stage. It might be a lot weaker than the Indigo Thunderpython, but it was still stronger than anyone here.

Lin Yun, on the other hand, fell into deep thought. He recalled how Leng Yi summoned the Draconian Rockrats to attack the Heavenly Province Academy previously, but the plan was ruined by him. Coincidentally, they were going to use the same tactic again. If it was in the past, Lin Yun might have some concern about the rat king. But as of now?

Disdain filled Lin Yun’s face as he looked at the rat king. If the Indigo Thunderpython died in his hand, then what could a mere rat do?

When he released his aura, all the trees within a thousand meter radius snapped, causing the rats to feel great pressure. They trembled in fear before they were sent flying by Lin Yun’s aura.

“The Violet Palace Realm!” Pan Yue and Han Fei were both shocked. How could the aura of a Violet Palace Realm cultivator be so powerful? Even the core disciples of quasi-overlord forces wouldn’t be any different from Lin Yun’s aura, not to mention that Lin Yun had clearly just made his breakthrough.

The rat king also began to struggle when it sensed Lin Yun’s aura. But the struggle only lasted briefly before it was overwhelmed by violent emotions.

“Die,” Lin Yun didn’t give the rat any chance and poured his xiantian sword intent into his sword. When he threw his sword, the sword turned into a silvery sword ray that chopped off the rat king’s head. When the sword returned to his hand, the rat king’s head fell onto the ground.

“The Flower Burial Sword!” Liu Yunyan was shocked. Was this the true power of the Flower Burial Sword? It was no different from an ordinary sword in Lu Siyin’s hand, but it was entirely different when Lin Yun was wielding it.

“This…” Pan Yue and Han Fei were badly startled as they dropped on their knees. They immediately started begging for their lives, “Flower Burial, please spare our lives!”

The Bloodwing Pavilion and Threesolute Manor’s disciples all felt awkward seeing Pan Yue and Han Fei beg for their lives. They faced their own dilemma because they didn’t know if they should also beg for their lives. But when Lin Yun swept his cold gaze over, all of them dropped on their knees without any hesitation.

“I heard you guys like to rob others?” Lin Yun looked at Pan Yue and Han Fei coldly. “Then leave behind all your interspatial pouches.”

Pan Yue and Han Fei’s faces instantly became ugly, but they didn’t have a choice. They didn’t dare to fight with Lin Yun. They knew that they would end up like Ye Cangming and the rat king if they dared to disagree. Although they were reluctant, they still left behind their interspatial pouches.

“Get lost,” said Lin Yun. His words made everyone feel relieved as they quickly ran for their lives.

Looking at the interspatial pouches on the ground, the Heavenly Province Academy’s disciples were stunned. All of them were filled with admiration for how Lin Yun made the Bloodwing Pavilion and Threesolute Manor kneel.

Even if the core disciple of their academy was here, this was probably the limit to what they could do. They couldn’t believe that Lin Yun actually came from the Great Qin Empire.

“Thanks,” said Liu Yuynan as she looked at Lin Yun. Naturally, there was another meaning to her gratitude. She knew Lin Yun’s personality, so Lin Yun would’ve already killed them if it wasn’t for her. After all, it was an unspoken rule among the quasi-overlord forces not to kill each others’ elite disciples as the losses would be too great.

So even if Lin Yun didn’t come, Pan Yue and Han Fei also wouldn’t have taken her life. So Lin Yun naturally did out of consideration for the Heavenly Province Academy.

“It’s nothing,” smiled Lin Yun as he tapped on his interspatial pouches and retrieved a flower.

“The Indigoflame Goldlotus!” Liu Yunyan had joy on her face when she looked at the flower.

“I kept my promise,” smiled Lin Yun as he retrieved four lotuses for Liu Yunyan.

“Four?” Liu Yunyan was surprised.

“One is for you. Even if you don’t want it, don’t you have to think about the fellow disciples that came with you?” explained Lin Yun.

“Thank you,” Liu Yunyan accepted the four lotuses. At the same time, the surrounding disciples were all filled with good opinions for Lin Yun. They were going to receive rewards from the sect for this mission, so the lotus was a pleasant surprise for them.

“This is for you, silly lass,” smiled Lin Yun as he looked at Bai Yi.

“T-this...t-t-thank you, Big Brother Lin.” Bai Yi’s face was red as her heart beat wildly.

Liu Yunyan watched this scene with a smile, but she didn’t say anything about it. After all, Bai Yi did save Lin Yun’s life. So it wasn’t overkill for Lin Yun to give her one lotus.

“I’ll keep my promise as well and recommend that you become a guest deacon after I become a core disciple,” said Liu Yunyan.

Lin Yun simply smiled and kept his silence. Core disciples could recommend that an outsider should become a guest elder, but it was still uncertain if he could become one. He was prepared for anything that would come and he just hoped that it would go smoothly.
