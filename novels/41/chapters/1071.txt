Chapter 1072 - Kill

Everyone looked at the back of Lin Yun’s figure with shock in their eyes. They were shocked by Lin Yun’s confidence, or rather, his arrogance. Rumor had it that Lin Yun was arrogant, but no one really knew how arrogant he really was.

Just how arrogant was Lin Yun to say those words? The Imperial Feather Realm Son wasn’t easy to deal with, let alone all of the Realm Sons together. Lin Yun was only in the fifth soul Heavenly Soul Realm, not to mention that he revealed his strongest attack.

No matter how they looked at it, no one thought that Lin Yun could face all of the Realm Sons even though his sword intent had reached a heaven-defying level. After all, none of the Realm Sons were pushovers.

“Is Lin Yun insane? He isn’t cowering before the seven realm sons? Is he really insisting on killing the Nether Divinity Realm Son?”

“He must be insane. How stupid can he be…”

“The seven realm sons are probably dumbfounded…” The spectators flew into an uproar because they had no idea what Lin Yun was doing.

The Realm Sons locked their brows together because Lin Yun put them in a difficult position. They weren’t as shameless as the Nether Divinity Realm Son, so they didn’t want to gang up on Lin Yun. With that, the Realm Sons and spectators fell silent.

“How is it? Do you guys think I have that qualification?” asked Lin Yun. No one had expected Lin Yun to break the silence, but they could hear his fighting spirit when he spoke. He didn’t turn around, but he still emitted a powerful aura. Clearly, he wanted to defeat all of the Realm Sons on his own.

“Lin Yun, we have no intention of killing you. You just have to let the Nether Divinity Realm Son go,” said the Imperial Diagram Realm Son.

“That’s right. You’ve already taken it too far, so there’s no way we can watch you kill him.”

“The Nether Divinity Realm Son is wrong, but he doesn’t deserve to die. He wants to kill you, but aren’t you still alive? Why must you take it so far?” The other Realm Sons began to speak up while displaying their powerful auras.

Although they spoke in a righteous tone that sounded reasonable, they were annoying Lin Yun. How was it reasonable for the Nether Divinity Realm Son to kill him, but sinful for him to do the same? The Nether Divinity Realm Son set up the Demon Slaughtering Assembly to humiliate him, so was it too much to slap him a few times?

The Nether Divinity Realm Son’s failure to kill him allowed his strength to surge even more. So was he supposed to thank the Nether Divinity Realm Son? Just how laughable was that?

Lin Yun smiled because he already knew that the Realm Sons were going to say something. However, they were more shameful than he thought they would be. When the Imperial Diagram Realm Son saw that Lin Yun’s fighting spirit hadn’t dissipated, rage flashed in his eyes. “Lin Yun, there’s no way we will join hands to bully you. If news got out that seven Realm Sons ganged up on you, we would turn into a laughing stock. Keep in mind that we’re only expressing our goodwill to you. It’s not like we’re really afraid of you…” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Get lost!” Lin Yun interrupted.

“What did you say?” questioned the Imperial Diagram Realm Son with killing intent in his eyes.

“You’re starting to annoy me.” Lin Yun turned around and his sky sword intent soared into the sky. A boundless sword aura descended from the sky along with thunderstorm energy that could shatter everything in the world.

The Imperial Diagram Realm Son’s face changed because he never expected that Lin Yun would attack so decisively and threw a punch at him. Who would have thought that Lin Yun had the guts to punch the Imperial Diagram Realm Son?

When the two punches collided, the Imperial Diagram Realm Son’s sleeves shattered and he was forced to his knees. At this moment, Lin Yun looked like a deity as he was wrapped in a torrential killing aura. This bold decision of his to attack dumbfounded the crowd. Everyone could tell that Lin Yun really wanted to take the Imperial Diagram Realm Son’s life.

Suddenly, a golden war armor appeared on the Imperial Diagram Realm Son’s body. If it wasn’t for this armor, he would’ve lost his life to Lin Yun’s attack. As for Lin Yun, he was enveloped in his Azure Dragon Sword Aura.

“Stop!” The other Realm Sons unleashed their holy spirits and charged over at Lin Yun.

“Haha, Lin Yun, you really want to fall out with me?” The Imperial Diagram Realm Son sneered. He only stood up because he thought that he had a relationship with Lin Yun. But since Lin Yun didn’t want any face, he would kill Lin Yun.

Lin Yun responded to the Imperial Diagram Realm Son’s question with a mighty slap. It was so strong that the water on the Saint Spiritual Lake exploded 100 feet into the air. The slap also made the Imperial Diagram Realm Son spit up blood as he fell to his knees. The slap was even more brutal than the slap to the Nether Divinity Realm Son’s face. After all, it sent the Imperial Diagram Realm Son flying over a thousand meters away.

Lin Yun ignored everyone that was charging at him as he stomped his foot on the ground. Spreading his arms apart, he chased after the Imperial Diagram Realm Son like a Golden Crow through the air.

A cold light flashed in the Imperial Feather Realm Son’s pupils because Lin Yun easily broke free from the holy spirits that were enveloping him. Although it looked casual, Lin Yun pulled off quite the feat.

“Lin Yun, do you really want to go against me?” The Imperial Diagram Realm Son stabilized himself as he gnashed his teeth.

Lin Yun knew that the Imperial Diagram Realm Son wanted to stall for time. However, there was no way Lin Yun would fall for it. He wasn’t going to put himself in a disadvantageous situation and face the other six Realm Sons if he had a choice.

“Actually, I have something to tell you,” said Lin Yun. He got closer and with every step, an Iris Flower bloomed beneath him.

“Go on,” sneered the Imperial Diagram Realm Son coldly.

“I loathed you from the first time I saw you. That slap just now felt extremely satisfying.” Lin Yun smiled as he stood before the Imperial Diagram Realm Son.

“You’re courting death!” The Imperial Diagram Realm Son’s gaze became sharp as a golden throne appeared beneath him. It was his holy spirit, the emperor’s throne.

“Get lost!” The Azure Firmament Tree with Iris Flower suddenly appeared behind Lin Yun. At this moment, Lin Yun had pushed his sky sword intent to the limit. Various phenomena appeared as he suppressed the Imperial Diagram Realm Son’s holy spirit.

With a wave of his hand, the Flower Burial Sword flew into Lin Yun’s grasp. Then, he tore through the Imperial Diagram Realm Son’s holy spirit before manifesting a lotus. Azure Lotus!

Cracks spread across the Imperial Diagram Realm Son’s armor while blood dripped everywhere. At the same time, a series of rumbling sounds rang out while Lin Yun’s palm reached out towards the Imperial Diagram Realm Son. The Imperial Diagram Realm Son’s face changed because Lin Yun was too terrifying.

His dao armor was his trump card, but it was destroyed with just one attack from Lin Yun. Fortunately, he had his holy spirit or else he would have died. The Imperial Diagram Realm Son’s face turned sinister because he could tell that Lin Yun was targeting him.

“Lin Yun, what do you want? I don’t remember a grudge between us!” The Imperial Diagram Realm Son roared with half of his cheek now swollen.

“I want your life!” Lin Yun’s gaze turned cold because the Imperial Diagram Realm Son was the person who interfered earlier, causing the seven Realm Sons to take a stand. When the last phenomenon from the Three Heavenly Divides bloomed, Lin Yun’s sword hummed in the atmosphere.

The Imperial Diagram Realm Son’s face was flush with fear because he had never felt so afraid before. At this moment, it looked like the once arrogant Imperial Diagram Realm Son was being reprimanded by a deity.

Watching Lin Yun walk over, the Imperial Diagram Realm Son began to panic. After all, he could sense that his holy spirit was on the verge of collapsing under Lin Yun’s sword aura.

“Lin Yun, stop!” The six other Realm Sons started to panic because they would become a laughingstock if they allowed Lin Yun to kill the Imperial Diagram Realm Son.
