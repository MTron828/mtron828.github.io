Chapter 886 - Qin Feng of the Beaconfiend Realm

Aside from the flames in the plaza, not a single sound could be heard. Countless gazes looked at Lin Yun with shock. Even if they knew that Lin Yun had his spiritual sword intent at greater mastery, they didn’t expect that Lin Yun would be able to kill Feng Xuan so easily.

Defeating someone and killing someone were two entirely different matters. However, the most shocking thing was that Lin Yun also knew the Flamecloud Incinerating Palm. The greater fortune martial technique was infamous in the entire Thunderflame City and many people were injured by it.

Feng Xuan was impressive since he could summon six purple flaming seals, so no one would imagine that Lin Yun was capable of summoning gold flaming seals. They couldn’t believe that an outsider actually managed to cultivate the Flamecloud Incinerating Palm to such a terrifying height.

However, the true key to Lin Yun’s victory was his sword that tore apart Feng Xuan’s flame intent. If he hadn’t used his sword to injure Feng Xuan, the Flamecloud Incinerating Palm wouldn’t have killed Feng Xuan.

After all, even though Feng Xuan was only at the level of purple flaming seals, it was empowered by second grade flame intent.

It was even more unbelievable that Lin Yun could bring the spiritual sword intent to greater mastery before reaching Heavenly Soul Realm. With just this alone, Lin Yun was comparable to the heaven-defying geniuses from the higher realms.

But what would they think if they knew that Lin Yun’s spiritual sword intent at greater mastery wasn’t his limit? On top of that, he didn’t even use his strongest attack. His spiritual sword intent had long reached complete mastery and was only half a step away from sky sword intent.

There were also others in Thunderflame City with tribulation qualifications like Feng Xuan. When they looked at Lin Yun, their eyes were filled with fear. Since Lin Yun could kill Feng Xuan, he was capable of killing them too.

When the others from the Flamecloud Realm recovered from their shock, panic was all over their faces. They could sense countless malicious gazes, which made them turn pale. After all, they had offended many people and things wouldn’t be good now that Feng Xuan wasn’t around.

WIthout hesitation, everyone from the Flamecloud Realm ran away. Lin Yun merely smiled because he couldn’t be bothered with them. He knew that he didn’t have to deal with those people personally. Before anyone could react, an interspatial pouch flew from Feng Xuan’s corpse.

“Greetings! I am the Profound Amber Realm’s Flower Burial Lin Yun and I’m new here!” Lin Yun squinted his eyes with a faint smile as he looked around.

The spectators were stunned by Lin Yun’s response. It looked like Lin Yun knew how to advance and retreat. He wasn’t arrogant enough to look down on everyone just because he had killed Feng Xuan. But when they heard how Lin Yun introduced himself as a ‘newcomer’, many people had bitter smiles.

Lin Yun had already killed Feng Xuan upon arriving in Thunderflame City, which was unimaginable to many people. In that split second, everyone knew that Lin Yun was a prideful person. He wasn’t arrogant, so he was naturally welcomed by everyone.

In response, the crowd smiled and cupped their hands. The Heavenly Path was brutal where the strong preyed on the weak. Just a moment ago, they were all expecting to see Lin Yun die. But when Feng Xuan was killed by Lin Yun, their attitude changed and they were filled with respect.

Meanwhile, Fang Shaoyu, Zhao Chen, and Zhu Qingshan felt like they were dreaming because everything was surreal.

Lin Yun casually sifted through the pouch and found at least 300,000 astral pellets. It was an obscene amount that probably came from many strongholds that the Flamecloud Realm owned.

The amount was probably saved up since the beginning minus the pellets that were needed to cultivate. Most likely, Feng Xuan was saving these for his tribulation. But now, all of the astral pellets belonged to Lin Yun.

With the Flamecloud Realm resolved, Lin Yun was in a good mood. He led Fang Shaoyu, Zhao Chen, and Zhu Qingshan on a stroll through the plaza. They didn’t have to worry about not having enough astral pellets for intermediate fortune cultivation techniques. The only problem now was if they could find one.

They spent roughly an hour strolling the entire plaza. When they were reaching the end, the eyes of Fang Shaoyu, Zhao Chen, and Zhu Qingshan had become dim because they couldn’t find any greater fortune cultivation techniques. Furthermore, all the intermediate fortune cultivation techniques in the market were incredibly expensive.

“If you guys aren’t in a hurry, why don’t you use intermediate fortune cultivation techniques for now?” Lin Yun asked. His Azure Firmament Sword Sutra was a top-tiered greater fortune martial technique, but he couldn’t pass it around.

If the trio were captured and his cultivation technique fell into the hands of others, it would be disadvantageous to him. Plus, it would reveal his secret of practicing two cultivation techniques at the same time.

Fang Shaoyu, Zhao Chen, and Zhu Qingshan started to hesitate when they heard Lin Yun. An intermediate fortune cultivation technique could naturally boost their strength, but it wasn’t good enough for them. Furthermore, they felt bad that Lin Yun was paying for their cultivation techniques.

“Let’s go. The astral pellets weren’t mine to begin with, so I won’t feel any heartache using them,” smiled Lin Yun. Before the trio could respond, Lin Yun led them to a store.

The owner of the store came from the Beaconfiend Realm, a realm stronger than the Flamecloud Realm. It was rather famous in Thunderflame City. The techniques and treasures they sold came from the various ruins, which meant that they were quite strong to excavate the ruins. It was quite impressive that they had intermediate fortune cultivation techniques.

“I’ll be taking this Bloodshark Art according to its price of 130,000 astral pellets,” said Lin Yun. The grey-clothed youth he was speaking to had told him the price earlier.

So, the grey-clothed youth’s eyes lit up when he heard that. The price was a little high, but he was confident that Lin Yun could afford it because of Feng Xuan’s interspatial pouch.Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Haha. Young Master Flower Burial is really straightforward.” The youth smiled as he took the interspatial pouch and handed a flawless jade slip over. There were also other intermediate fortune cultivation techniques in the plaza, but it was a pity as most of them had a requirement on attributes. So they couldn’t match Fang Shaoyu, Zhao Chen, and Zhu Qingshan at the same time. So despite knowing that he would be slaughtered for the price, Lin Yun still bought it.

“Gu Fei, return the astral pellets.” Right at this moment, a handsome youth came out from the Beaconfiend Realm’s crowd.

Looking at the youth, Lin Yun was surprised because he recognized this person. This person was Qin Feng, the leader of Beaconfiend Realm. He was one of four who had reached the first soul Heavenly Soul Realm.

If it wasn’t for the first soul Heavenly Soul Realm experts, Lin Yun wouldn’t have had trouble with Feng Xuan. After all, he could have used his spiritual sword intent at complete mastery. If that happened, he could have taken Feng Xuan down with three moves.

“Are you giving me an intermediate fortune cultivation technique for free? Isn’t this gift a little too expensive?” Lin Yun took back the astral pellets and looked at Qin Feng.

“Consider it a gift of friendship,” smiled Qin Feng. “Since you can kill Feng Xuan, this means that you’re not any weaker than the four of us, not to mention that you’re not even in the Heavenly Soul Realm. Your potential is boundless, and it’s absolutely worth it for me to befriend you with an intermediate fortune cultivation technique.”

“That sounds reasonable, but it’s a pity that I don’t lack 130,000 astral pellets…” Lin Yun smiled. He didn’t want to owe someone a favor for no reason. Most importantly, he wanted to hear what Qin Feng had to say. He knew that this matter wasn’t so simple.

Qin Feng’s eyes shined brightly as he spoke, “You’re in the position to say that you don’t lack astral pellets? Then what about greater fortune cultivation techniques? What about sixth-grade spiritual pellets? Or artifacts with dao rhythm? What about treasures that can boost your martial intent? What about advanced fortune martial techniques like overlord, imperial, or monarch ones?”

Every single item that came from Qin Feng’s mouth was priceless and even caused some fluctuation in Lin Yun’s heart. Without any change on his face, he replied, “I don’t like it when someone beats around the bush. I don’t believe that you can take those out.”

“I don’t need to have them. I just need to know more than you to tempt you. This isn’t the right place to speak. Come with me if you dare,” smiled Qin Feng confidently.

“Lin Yun!” Fang Shaoyu, Zhao Chen, and Zhu Qingshan called out to Lin Yun with worry. They could sense that Qin Feng was strong and that Qin Feng wasn’t someone the likes of Feng Xuan could be compared to. From a certain angle, it felt as though Qin Feng had gone through the tribulation of life and death.

“Someone who dares to kill Feng Xuan doesn't have this much courage?” Qin Feng revealed a playful smile.

“Wait here for me.” Lin Yun had the Indigoflame Thunderwhip as his trump card, so he wasn’t afraid of Qin Feng playing any tricks.

“Come with me!” Qin Feng smiled. He then disappeared before Lin Yun, revealing his bizarre movement technique. Lin Yun was briefly stunned before he executed his Cloudsoaring Art and chased after Qin Feng. With a series of sonic booms, Lin Yun could barely catch up to Qin Feng despite pushing his movement technique to the limit.

Thirty minutes later, Lin Yun stopped on a roof with his brows locked together because Qin Feng had completely disappeared. It was as if he had never existed in the first place. But before he could find Qin Feng, a torrential killing aura descended at Lin Yun.

The attack didn’t come from Qin Feng, but another first soul Heavenly Soul Realm expert. It appears that the other party had prepared an ambush for him.

In that split second, Lin Yun could sense the threat of danger looming over him. If he wasn’t careful, he would lose his life.
