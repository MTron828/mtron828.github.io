Chapter 276 - Cloudstun Sword

His punch produced a huge explosion in the air that sounded like the buzzing of a cauldron. His aura charged forward like a sharp sword along with the ancient cauldron’s saintly music ringing out. A long gash in the sea of clouds appeared, which looked like a river being split into two.

Lin Yun’s aura soared like an ancient beast that even caused the mountain to tremble when he landed on his foot. At the same time, there was saintly music that accompanied his punch. Basking in the sunlight, his facial features were further defined.

“I’ve reached the third stage in just half a month…” Lin Yun muttered to himself. It was unquestionable that cultivating the Dracophant Battle Physique was taboo in the Great Qin Empire because he would be pitting himself against a colossal being like the Primal Origin Sect.

But so what? Lin Yun’s heart was as clear as a mirror. The 1,300 second-grade spiritual jades hadn’t come easily, but he made good use of them by practicing the Dracophant Battle Physique.

Now that he looked back, he felt that he made a good decision. He showed stunning progress by bringing the Dracophant Battle Physique to the third stage in half a month. Everyone would be envious of this speed.

Then again, Lin Yun made such swift progress because he was an exception to normal cultivators. In the entire Great Qin Empire, no one dared to have their body ignited while they were in the Xiantian Realm. No one could bear the pain while risking being reduced to ashes. Lin Yun didn’t rely on luck in his cultivation.

But the Dracophant Battle Physique slowed down once Lin Yun reached the third stage. Fortunately, the transformation in his physique would also strengthen his Dragon-Tiger Fist. The Heavenly Profound Sect’s disciples would practice the Dragon-Tiger Sculpture when practicing the Dragon-Tiger Fist, but the Dracophant Battle Physique was a lot stronger and more compatible with the Dragon-Tiger Fist.

“The stronger my body, the stronger my fist technique. I have to ponder how to bring these two to their limits.” Lin Yun’s thoughts cleared up and he began practicing the Dragon-Tiger Fist.

When he executed the Dragon-Tiger Might, his aura reached the sixth stage of the Profound Martial Realm. He used the Dragon-Tiger Steps and his figure soared like a dragon.

Flying Dragon, Leaping Tiger!

Dragon Tail!

Dragon Painting!

Lin Yun smoothly executed the five forms, pairing them with the Undying Vajra Sea, Sky Breaking Seal, and Demon Vanquishing Seal as he wished. He was like a dragon soaring in the sky and a tiger roaming throughout the mountains.

He was creatively blending everything together, unlike Bu Chen who got arrogant just because he could barely use Dragon Painting. Lin Yun was excavating the endless potential of the Dragon-Tiger Fist.

“All my martial techniques might seem to be a mess, but I’ve actually made an entire set by blending the Dracophant Battle Physique, Dragon-Tiger Fist, and Seven Profound Steps together.” Lin Yun paused briefly and looked at the towering peak beneath his foot. He muttered, “It’s like this mountain. The Dracophant Battle Physique is the mountain, while the Dragon-Tiger Fist and Seven Profound Steps are the trees. All of them are crucial. As for my heart, it is the mountain’s spirit.”

Lin Yun’s insight opened a new door in cultivation for him.

“But I still need to form the Golden Crow Seal. I can’t fall behind now, otherwise there will be a flaw in the mountain.” Lin Yun then started practicing the Seven Profound Steps. He had been cultivating it for months and he had also used the Seven Profound Steps in actual battles.

He wasn’t far from greater mastery. He just needed to go with the flow to form the Golden Crow Seal. Unless he was stupid, doing this should be easy.

Time gradually passed and the date of the Alliance-Union Battle got closer. Not only Lin Yun, but the top ten on the Mortal Ranking were focused on cultivating.

On a mountain range with hundreds of peaks, a youth was practicing his sword in the woods. He would soar like a graceful butterfly at times and the trees would bend backward wherever his sword went.

“Cloudstun Dawn!” A youth suddenly roared and infused his sword intent into the sword. When he swung his sword out, the sword flowed like a fine thread that contained unimaginable sword intent. The wisp of sword intent then slowly dissipated until it faded away.

The youth smiled and sheathed his sword. A huge explosion was produced when the sword returned to the scabbard. All the trees in an eight hundred meter radius suddenly snapped. But that wasn’t all. The sword intent reappeared and fluctuated, grinding the trees into bags of dust.

“Bravo, Junior Brother Chu!” Wang Yan walked over with a smile.

The youth was naturally Chu Haoyu, who fought with Bai Lixuan back then. Chu Haoyu turned around and replied, “You’re being too polite. I’m still lacking compared to you, Senior Brother.”

“I’m only a few years older than you. If I didn’t have the advantage of my cultivation, I might not be your opponent. I’ve long heard that you’ve reached greater mastery with the Cloudstun Sword, a transcendent profound martial technique. I’m truly impressed now that I witnessed it for myself,” Wang Yan waved his hand with a smile.

Any martial technique would exhibit great power upon reaching greater mastery. As for transcendent profound martial techniques, they were even stronger than ordinary spiritual martial techniques when they reached greater mastery. So it naturally went without saying for a top-tiered martial technique like the Cloudstun Sword. With this martial technique alone, Chu Haoyu could defeat most of the inner disciples on the Earth Ranking.

“You’re truly worthy of being the strongest in the outer sect. Your talent and comprehension can even be ranked among the top in the entire sect,” said Wang Yan.

“There’s no need for you to be humble. You’re a direct descendant of the Wang Clan. I might be confident in surpassing you, but I will never underestimate you. Let’s stop beating around the bush. Why did you come here?” asked Chu Haoyu.

Wang Yan’s eyes flashed with cold light when he heard that. Chu Haoyu had an odd temperament. He didn’t even care that Wang Yan was a direct descendant of the Wang Clan.

Then again, this also meant that Chu Haoyu was more reliable in the Alliance-Union Battle, meaning that Lin Yun would definitely die.

“There is still room for improvement in the Cloudstun Dawn. I can be your sparring partner if you’re willing,” said Wang Yan as he lowered his pride. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Chu Haoyu’s eyes lit up when he heard that and he smiled, “I’m naturally more than happy to hear this since you can be my sparring partner. I hope that Senior Brother can pressure me a little. I wish to get the Cloudstun Sword to complete mastery before the Alliance-Union Battle!”

Wang Yan’s heart sank when he heard that. He was shocked by Chu Haoyu’s ambition that didn’t waste any opportunities. It seemed like the Alliance-Union Battle would be interesting this year.
