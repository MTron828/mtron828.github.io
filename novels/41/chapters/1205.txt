Chapter 1206: Shining Brightly (1)

Countless starlight formed a waterfall that descended from the first layer of heaven. Even though many people had seen this before, it was still shocking.

But it was different this time. When Lin Yun used this move in the Azure Dragon Sword Array, the outcome of the battle was pretty much determined. But this time, Lin Yun was attacking out of desperation.

Even if Lin Yun managed to defeat Feng Tianyuan, he still had to face the second wave of attacks from the elders. Clearly, he was out of options.

Feng Tianyuan’s hair was scattered and blood dripped down from his body. In the eyes of others, he seemed to be evenly matched with Lin Yun in the previous clash. But only Feng Tianyuan himself knew that he wasn’t.

After Lin Yun summoned his Demonic Astral Flowers, the power of Lin Yun’s sword reached a whole new level that crushed Feng Tianyuan. Even if he was a quasi-Dragon Pulse Realm expert, there was no way he could compare to Lin Yun after he sealed his cultivation in the Heavenly Soul Realm.

Furthermore, he wasn’t even Lin Yun’s opponent when it came to attainments in the way of the sword. The only reason he managed to last until now was by relying on his foundation. So when he saw Lin Yun charging over, Feng Tianyuan couldn’t help laughing out of anger, “Little bastard, it’s time for you to die!”

As long as he blocked Lin Yun’s sword, the other elders could kill Lin Yun. If Lin Yun was smart, he would choose to give up and admit defeat.

“Kneel and beg me to spare you!” Feng Tianyuan laughed while he pushed his sword technique to the limit. In the next second, nine stars like flaming meteorites shined brightly. The sword rays placed a restriction on the surrounding space and formed an unbreakable barrier.

At the same time, the three elders approached with their swords ready to attack. They had been charging up their attacks for a long time and now their swords emitted a dazzling radiance. Lin Yun felt miserable from the three sword auras even though they weren’t attacking him yet. It felt like an invincible wind was scraping the surface of his body.

If it was someone else in Lin Yun’s position, they would be covered in blood and turned into a corpse by now.

“Lin Yun, I can still spare you if you admit defeat right now!” Feng Tianyuan squinted his eyes with a grin while he hid behind the barrier formed by his sword rays.

Truth be told, he was lacking confidence. After all, Lin Yun’s sword was terrifying and he was already forced to the point that he couldn’t retaliate. He could only choose to defend with his sword aura that was greatly restricted by Lin Yun’s boundless sword aura.

Lin Yun wasn’t fazed by Feng Tianyuan. After all, Lin Yun would never beg. He had come this far with great difficulty, so how could he possibly give up?

Everyone stared at Lin Yun in anticipation of what he would do. After all, this path was chosen by Lin Yun himself. When he forced Feng Tianyuan into a desperate strait, he should have known that the three elders wouldn’t sit idly by.

“Just die!” Lin Yun said.

As the sound of heaven cracking became more intense, the starlight shining on Lin Yun grew more brilliant.

So he easily destroyed Feng Tianyuan’s barrier with the swing of his sword. Shortly after, Lin Yun’s sword ray destroyed the nine sword rays, causing huge explosions. The sound alone was enough to make everyone’s hearts tremble.

As the Flower Burial Sword buzzed, Lin Yun’s sword continued to head towards Feng Tianyuan’s throat.

“What arrogance!” Feng Tianyuan raged, “You want to kill me? It won’t be that easy!”

Feng Tianyuan was ultimately an expert in the quasi-Dragon Pulse Realm. Even if he had sealed his cultivation to the Heavenly Soul Realm, his foundation in the martial path wasn’t a joke. He remained composed despite being in such a dangerous position and charged toward Lin Yun.

The sword in his hand radiated with a cold light like a star in the sky. Countless sword rays descended from the sky like fireflies as he aimed for Lin Yun’s throat. He just needed Lin Yun to retreat. After all, he would win as long as Lin Yun’s sword didn’t fatally wound him.

But as Lin Yun’s sword continued to expand in Feng Tianyuan’s eyes, fear began to rise within Feng Tianyuan’s heart that was throbbing uncontrollably. His heart was practically on the verge of jumping out from his chest.

Now, he wasn’t even sure if Lin Yun was afraid of death. Instantly, all of Feng Tianyuan’s courage disappeared.

If Lin Yun didn’t change his attack, Feng Tianyuan would die. The power of Lin Yun’s Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords was too much this time around.

Feng Tianyuan didn’t want to die nor could he afford to die. After all, he was a quasi-Dragon Pulse Realm, so why would he have to die together with Lin Yun? Why did he have to care about the rules?

As a decisive light flashed through Lin Yun’s eyes, Feng Tianyuan immediately broke through the restriction of the Heavenly Soul Realm and reached the Empyrean Realm. But he had no idea that the cowardice in his heart was the greatest flaw in this confrontation. After all, not being decisive enough was a taboo when facing life and death.

As Lin Yun and Feng Tianyuan passed by each other, blood splashed out of Feng Tianyuan’s throat. Lin Yun’s sword had stabbed Feng Tianyuan’s throat. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Feng Tianyuan immediately dropped his sword and held his throat as he fell to the ground. Under everyone’s gaze, Feng Tianyuan’s cultivation continued to surge until it reached the pinnacle of the Empyrean Realm. Then, his cultivation broke through the boundary of the Empyrean Realm once more and reached the Elysium core Realm.

When his cultivation reached the quasi-Dragon Pulse Realm, the sword ray in his throat bloomed and his head blew up. Just like that, the Grand Elder of the Feng Clan had lost his life.

“No!” Feng Xuanzi yelled as his entire body began to tremble. After all, he had already violated the rules by allowing Feng Tianyuan to join the Four Phase Sword Array to kill Lin Yun. Who would have thought that his brother would fail and die?

Everyone in the plaza was a genius, so they could tell that Feng Tianyuan had lifted the restriction on his cultivation when facing death. Strictly speaking, Lin Yun had already won the moment Feng Tianyuan lifted the restriction on his cultivation. But Feng Tianyuan had died too quickly, causing this fact to be overlooked.
