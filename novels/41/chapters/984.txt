Chapter 985 - Endless Killing Intent

“You don’t have a good temper? Even Luo Chen doesn't dare to speak to me in this manner. Who do you think you are? All you do is rely on your pet. Without your pet, you’re no different from an ant!” Mu Xiuhan smiled coldly.

In his view, Lin Yun was just a joke to face all four of them at once. Even if Lin Yun’s pet was a little troublesome to deal with, that was all there was to it. If they really fought, he was confident that Lin Yun’s pet wouldn’t last more than ten moves.

“As you wish.” Lin Yun patted Lil’ Red’s head for it to calm down. When the crowd saw Lin Yun stopping his pet, they were quite surprised. They didn’t understand why Lin Yun was so confident.

Seeing that Lin Yun had stopped his pet, Feng Xuanyi’s eyes began to flash with killing intent. He signaled Chen Hao and Zhao Qi to join hands with him, Mu Xiuhan stopped them, “Let me deal with him.”

The moment he spoke, boundless killing intent soared out of his body. When Mu Xiuhan’s killing intent and fighting spirits soared into the sky, a huge patch of thunderclouds covered the sky. The lightning was so strong that the plaza began to quake. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Pinnacle fourth soul Heavenly Soul Realm!” The crowd was fearful when they sensed the immense aura in Mu Xiuhan’s body. The boundless origin energy of his aura oceans even caused the entire heaven and earth to start trembling. In fact, it sent many seated geniuses flying.

“Lin Yun, your journey in the Azure Dragon Region has been too smooth, which is why you’re so arrogant. You should know that the Heavenly Path isn’t simple and that this seat isn’t something you can have,” said Mu Xiuhan with lightning flashing through his pupils.

Before he even got close, a boundless purple mist created by his lightning aura swept forward. It covered Lin Yun’s stage, which started to suppress Lin Yun. The bright fog then formed a star that charged at Lin Yun.

Mu Xiuhan was clearly a genius. First, he used the lightning fog to slow Lin Yun down. Then, he changed the fog into a star to pressure Lin Yun before any resistance occurred.

All of a sudden, tens of thousands of lightning bolts exploded. Luo Chen and the other seven heads sucked in a cold breath when they saw Mu Xiuhan’s ruthless attack. They could tell that Mu Xiuhan unleashed his strongest attack, a terrifying secret technique.

Rather than probing Lin Yun, Mu Xiuhan unleashed a finishing move. It was so fast that not even Lil’ Red had an opportunity to help.

At this moment, the stage was filled with lightning and boundless origin energy. It was akin to a pond of lightning. Although no one was inside the pond, they could sense the terrifying power.

Luo Chen’s group frowned because Lin Yun was caught off guard. Then again, no one would have imagined that Mu Xiuhan would bring out his strongest attack right from the start. There was basically no hope for Lin Yun anymore.

“Brother Mu isn’t like other people who boast with empty words. All will kneel to him as soon as he makes his move.!” Feng Xuanyi sneered. “Lin Yun, it was your honor to die by Brother Mu’s hands. In the end, you were just a little ant.”

Feng Xuanyi’s smile froze as countless golden crows flew out of the boundless lightning. Then, a gigantic winged human appeared and threw a punch. This made Mu Xiuhan’s face change as he miraculously dodged the attack. But even so, the winged human quickly grabbed hold of Feng Xuanyi.

At the same time, a hand grabbed Feng Xuanyi’s neck, which caused all the spectators to exclaim. After all, Lin Yun was standing on the stage, unscathed. Grabbing hold of Feng Xuanyi’s neck, Lin Yun indifferently looked down at Feng Xuanyi. Feng Xuanyi had provoked him time and time again even after he was taught a lesson.

Losing all his patience with Feng Xuanyi, Lin Yun destroyed Feng Xuanyi’s head with a single punch. The crowd was shocked because they couldn’t believe Lin Yun’s decisiveness. Lin Yun figured out Feng Xuanyi’s flaw, so he made an easy kill. Feng Xuanyi was on the Heavenly Path Mirror! Did he really die just like that?

Although Feng Xuanyi was already injured by Lil’ Red, he was still one of the seven heads. His death was unfathomable to the crowd.

Mu Xiuhan’s face paled when he looked at Lin Yun. Anger grew in his eyes because Feng Xuanyi’s death was basically a slap to the face. “Good, good, good! Lin Yun, you’re taking it too far!”

“Sorry, but you’re the one who forced me to do it. Like I said, this stage is taken,” said Lin Yun coldly. It appeared that Lin Yun was determined to obtain the heart stage.

“Lin Yun, aren’t you a little too much to kill Feng Xuanyi? He was already heavily injured by your pet!” Chen Hao cried.

Lin Yun instantly sensed the killing intent coming from Chen Hao. Chen Hao was ranked third on the Azure Dragon Ranking and was a lot stronger than Feng Xuanyi. In many people’s hearts, he was in the same tier as Luo Chen and Mu Xiuhan. Listening to what Chen Hao said, Lin Yun replied, “Too much? How am I too much? Would Lil’ Red have injured him if he didn’t attack me first? Furthermore, I wasn’t done fighting with Mu Xiuhan, but he kept jumping up and yapping.”

Lin Yun didn’t like to confront others, but he was really disgusted by Chen Hao. After all, Mu Xiuhan’s party only relied on their advantage in numbers to suppress others and not daring to provoke Luo Chen but treating him as a pushover. So how could he possibly accept it?

“So what if he said something? Does he really deserve to die after a few words? Did you know that even though the seven of us have been competing with each other, we’ve never taken each other’s life?” Chen Hao snorted. “You have such a violent temper at such a young age. If you’re going to be this unreasonable, don’t blame us for joining hands together to suppress you.”

“Join hands? Go ahead. Do you think I’m afraid of you?” Lin Yun barked as his killing intent surging. Did they really think that he was afraid of them joining hands?
