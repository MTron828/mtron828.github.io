Chapter 2138: Weaving Through His Enemies

When dusk arrived, this gave the surrounding atmosphere a touch of melancholy and sadness. Under the hazy moonlight, no matter what others said or how furious they were, Lin Yun and An Liuyan slowly approached the Dragon’s Head, admiring the scenery.

“He is an interesting person.” The champion of the Fourth Heavenly Path, Mu Qianjue, leaned on the throne located at the Dragon’s Head while calmly watching Lin Yun and An Liuyan approaching his location. There were all kinds of people on the Blue Dragon Record. There were arrogant people, people hiding themselves, ruthless people, and those who would betray their allies. But only Lin Yun brought someone along with him.

If it wasn’t during the Blue Dragon Record, Mu Qianjue might have been interested in befriending someone like Ye Qingtian. But it was a pity that there could only be one champion on each path of the Blue Dragon Record. When he stood up from the throne, two people appeared from his sides: a woman and a man.

The one on the left was the holy son of the Northern Ridge’s Lone Mountain, Mo Cheng. He came from the Lone Mountain holy land, a divine mountain covered in snow. Five years ago, the Lone Mountain’s holy son was already at the Quasi-Saint Realm, reaching the pinnacle of the Azure Origin Phase.

His understanding of Ice Dao had reached a great height, and there were rumors that he could make a breakthrough to the Heavenly Origin Phase if he wanted, grasping his own sacred flame.

The woman on the right was the Lone Mountain’s holy maiden, Luo Ying. She and Mo Cheng were from the same sect and were a couple. They were also evenly matched in terms of strength.

If Mu Qianjue didn’t descend from the Heavenly Path, they would be the leaders among the Lone Mountain’s saint disciples. But when Mu Qianjue arrived, he displayed outstanding talent within a few years and shone even brighter than the holy son and maiden. Thus, their sect told Mo Cheng and Luo Ying to follow Mu Qianjue on the Blue Dragon Record.

If Lin Yun was willing to disclose his identity and become the Heavenly Dao Sect’s holy son, the Heavenly Dao Sect would probably give him the same treatment as well, having the Dao Yang Holy Son and Nether Orchid Holy Maiden follow him as the leader. After all, there was a huge difference between them and the champions of the Heavenly Paths.

When Lin Yun and An Liuyan finally arrived at the Dragon’s Head, this place became shrouded in a mist, and everyone outside the Dragon Mountains was so tiny that they looked like ants. The Dragon’s Head was also enveloped in the Indigo Divine Dragon’s aura, and one could feel comfortable throughout their bodies when they took a deep breath.

Lin Yun stopped and looked at the three standing before him, before his gaze fell onto Mu Qianjue. The two looked at each other as an intense atmosphere spread throughout the surroundings.

Mu Qianjue was surprised. As the Fourth Heavenly Path’s champion, he faintly saw something else on Ye Qingtian. He sensed that the two came from one of the lesser realms, and that they would have some differences when compared to geniuses from the Kunlun Realm. This was a weird feeling that couldn’t be described.

In a nutshell, Mu Qianjue felt a familiar aura coming from Lin Yun. Standing with his hands behind him, he said, “Ye Qingtian, you’re qualified to fight me. If you want to let her go to the Dragon’s Claw, I permit you to fight with me on the Dragon’s Head.”

“Nah. The Dragon’s Head is way better, and she’s worthy of it,” Lin Yun replied.

Mu Qianjue looked at Lin Yun, and his gaze gradually turned cold. He questioned, “Are you looking down on me?”

He felt that Ye Qingtian was being too disrespectful when he spoke in a somewhat polite tone. But Ye Qingtian insisted on wanting a demoness to take the Dragon’s Head spot.

“You’re overthinking it. I only want her to take the Dragon’s Head spot. It’s that simple,” Lin Yun replied.

Mu Qianjue’s face became dark before a cold smile rose on the corner of his lips.

The Lone Mountain’s holy son, Mo Cheng, coldly said, “Ye Qingtian, you’re really bold. Not only do you want to fight for the Dragon’s Head spot, but you even want to send her to that position after defeating so many righteous path’s holy sons. Even if Holy Son Qianjue agrees to it, you’ll have to ask all the geniuses on the Dragon Mountain if they agree to it!”

Everyone on the Indigo Dragon Path stopped what they were doing as they looked at Lin Yun. This was because Mo Cheng spoke the thoughts in their hearts, and they immediately echoed along.

“Holy Son Mo is right!”

“A demoness like her wants to be ranked ahead of us?”

“Ye Qingtian, you have the cheek to call yourself a swordsman genius? You’re more like an idiot!”

“Ye Qingtian, get lost from the Indigo Dragon Path!”

This was too shocking. Everyone on the Indigo Dragon Path echoed along with Mo Cheng’s words, demanding Ye Qingtian to leave the Indigo Dragon Path. This made An Liuyan a little afraid, so she sneaked a peek at Lin Yun. But she noticed that he had no emotions, and he even wanted to laugh. Seeing this, An Liuyan couldn’t help smiling as her heart calmed down.

When Lin Yun heard the surrounding voices, he wore a playful smile and understood what Senior Tian Xing meant back then. The title of ‘genius’ became so cheap that anyone could claim to be a genius. But how come only a few dared to proceed when he approached the Dragon’s Head earlier? This only made the corner of Lin Yun’s lip curl into a smile with a mocking look.

“Ye Qingtian, do you hear what all the geniuses are saying?” Mo Cheng said, sneering.

“Geniuses? Where are they? Why can’t I see any of them?” Lin Yun looked around with a playful expression.

“Everyone on the Divine Dragon Paths is a genius!” Mo Cheng said coldly.

“But I only see mediocre people everywhere, and only I’m shining brightly like the sun. All I see are birds chipping around while I’m the sole phoenix who will soar to the sky,” Lin Yun said. Mo Cheng didn’t pay much attention initially, but he soon noticed something wasn’t right.

Lin Yun’s sword aura was rising as a sword vibration echoed, drowning all of the noises on the mountain. At this moment, Lin Yun was shining so brightly that it made it hard for others to look at him. The aura given off by Lin Yun also made Mo Cheng feel a great pressure and he couldn’t help taking three steps back with his face becoming ugly.

Outside the Dragon Mountains, all the cultivators were shocked by Ye Qingtian’s performance, and thought that he was really bold with his words.

“I can’t see any geniuses, only barking dogs. Mu Qianjue, what do you think?” Lin Yun’s hair fluttered in the wind as he smiled at Mu Qianjue.

“Holy Son Qianjue, don’t bother wasting words with him. We’ll all make a move together and cripple him first!” Mo Cheng said coldly. The atmosphere on the Dragon’s Head suddenly became tense since a fight could break out the next moment.

Outside the Dragon Mountains, those from the Heavenly Dao Sect couldn’t help becoming nervous after seeing that Ye Qingtian was really going to fight the champion of the Fourth Heavenly Path.

“The Lone Mountain’s holy son is ranked in the top thirty on the Divine Dragon Elite Ranking, possessing the Frost Saint Physique. He actually suggested ganging up on Senior Brother Ye!”

“The holy maiden is also ruthless, and her aptitude isn’t any lower than Mo Chen.”

“What are you talking about? Only Mu Qianjue can be considered a golden-generation genius. After all, he’s the champion of the Fourth Heavenly Path!”

“Senior Brother Ye is in trouble now, but he’s really dashing!”

Many people discussed it, but the focus wasn’t on Mu Qianjue. There was nothing much to be said about Mu Qianjue since his title as the Champion of the Fourth Heavenly Path was sufficient.

“Kill!” Mo Cheng made the first move, with Luo Ying following behind. They executed their martial techniques, targeting Lin Yun’s vitals.

“World Cleansing Frost Dragon!” Mo Cheng held onto a saint spear and approached Lin Yun with a flash. There were nine saint auras enveloping his spear, making it look like a vivid White Divine Dragon.

“Divine Dragon Nine Transformation!” Luo Ying empowered her martial technique with the Ice Dao by dividing herself into nine figures, each afterimage performing a different move.

The attacks from Mo Cheng and Luo Ying arrived simultaneously, unleashing immense power.

“Four Peaceful Seas!” Lin Yun drew the Flower Burial Sword and executed the Divine Firefly Sword. With a shake of his wrist, eighteen sword rays flew out, with each sword ray looking like a massive wave that reached a thousand feet, facing Luo Ying’s attacks head-on.

The sword rays Lin Yun unleashed were dazzling, and a groan could be heard soon after. Luo Ying had blood dripping from her lip as she was sent flying away.

After resolving Luo Ying’s attack with one sword, Lin Yun showed pity in his eyes. If they were fighting one-on-one, he could inflict heavy injuries on Luo Ying by following up with another sword, which was the style of swordsmen. The moment they injured their opponents, they could end the battle quickly.

But it was a pity that he was tied down. So he calmly turned his body to the side as though he had already seen it coming and gently raised his sword. When the sword and spear clashed, countless sparks flew around. This might seem like a gentle attack, but two powerful energies clashed together.

This immediately made Mo Cheng feel great pressure, with cold sweat on his forehead. When he clashed with Lin Yun, he finally realized Ye Qingtian’s sword intent was terrifying. It was unfathomable, and Ye Qingtian’s saint aura was even stronger than his own! Just what cultivation technique did Ye Qingtian practice?

Lin Yun formed a seal and a silver radiance exploded with his sword aura manifesting into a quasi-domain. Lin Yun had brought out the Azure Dragon Sword Heart. Mo Cheng was sent flying away the moment Lin Yun brought it out.

“Flaming Golden Lotus!” After Mo Cheng was sent flying away, Lin Yun swung his sword, and his sword technique flowed smoothly like water and couldn’t be tracked. When he waved his hand, golden lotuses bloomed on a sea of flames with his sword aura catching up with Mo Cheng, who was flying away.

Mo Cheng raised his spear before him, but his indigo saint aura and greater dao crumbled before he threw up a mouthful of blood. When he looked at Lin Yun’s sharp gaze again, his heart trembled with his back covered in cold sweat.

After briefly resting to catch their breaths, Mo Cheng and Luo Ying dashed forth again, with ice and snow filling the surroundings. If it was an ordinary person facing the greater dao pressure that they gave off, they would be instantly immobilized.

But Lin Yun could move freely, and the frost would break whenever it got close to Lin Yun. The cause was that the dragon’s blood within him was circulating through his meridians. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

When the three clashed again, various phenomena appeared with each attack being lethal, and there would be a loud explosion whenever they clashed.

“Moon Reflection Mirror!”

“Flowing Time!”

“Planting Soldiers!”

Lin Yun swung his sword and the surrounding space became distorted when he used Moon Reflection Mirror to easily resolve the incoming attacks. He maintained his calm throughout the fight and unleashed the next two attacks directed at Mo Cheng and Luo Ying.

Lin Yun divided himself into two, resolving Mo Cheng and Luo Ying’s attacks. When his attack struck them, they briefly froze. But it didn’t end there. Lin Yun swung two sword strikes, unleashing two sword auras that looked like a bright moon, leaving a few holes in Mo Cheng and Luo Ying’s bodies.

The two Lin Yuns overlapped when Mo Cheng and Luo Ying landed on the ground. When the two landed on the ground, they coughed out a mouthful of blood and faced the incoming sword aura head-on when they raised their heads.

Mo Cheng and Luo Ying squinted before being sent flying away again. The entire Indigo Dragon Path fell into silence, leaving everyone dumbfounded. They could only see a series of dazzling attacks, and the battle had ended. Lin Yun looked like he could weave through his enemies as he wished with his sword.
