Chapter 1731 – Peaceful Time

“I naturally have no problem with it since Saint Elder arranged it.” The blue-robed youth was somewhat unhappy with Lin Yun’s tone, but he still replied with a smile.

“Oh.” Lin Yun nodded.

When the blue-robed youth saw Lin Yun’s response, his pupils flashed with unhappiness. He wondered where Lin Yun came from. After all, this fellow had practically replaced his position within the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion over the past six months. Not only was he qualified to play the Ni Chang Dress Song for Yue Weiwei, but he was also arrogant.

He initially wanted to suppress Lin Yun with his identity as the chief disciple, but he never expected Lin Yun to not even bother with him and treat him as if he was invisible. Furthermore, he couldn’t do anything because of his identity as the chief disciple.

“Lin Xiao, this is the chief disciple of the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion, Yan Tianchen. He just returned from training on the divine mountain and will take the lead during this Nirvana Banquet to compete with the other forces.” Mu Xueling explained while examining Lin Yun.

“Are there any rules during the Nirvana Banquet?” Lin Yun asked.

“Tianchen, you tell him.” Mu Xueling said.

“In the past, the Nirvana Banquet was only between the Four Musical Houses, and the other forces were only embellishments. But the six holy lands will be around for this Nirvana Banquet, along with the various musical clans in the Kunlun Realm. The ten musical clans might even come for this banquet.” Yan Tianchen smiled. After a brief pause, he continued smiling, “On a conservative estimate, there should be at least ten thousand musicians participating.”

Lin Yun was shocked when he heard that number; he now knew why Mu Xueling was so calm about it. If the ten musical clans came, the Four Musical Houses would pale in comparison. The ten musical clans all possessed the inheritance of a Grandmaster Musician. This meant that they had a Grandmaster Musician in the past or a living Grandmaster Musician in their clan.

Grandmaster Musicians grasped the Divine Dragon Tone and were comparable to Emperor Realm experts in terms of strength. They were scarce in the Kunlun Realm.

Yan Tianchen continued, “The reward this time is generous. Those who reached the top ten can receive an ancient score, ten Dragon Clan wines, and at least a hundred Profound Saint Pellets.”

“What is the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion up to?” Lin Yun asked curiously. What could they obtain in return for giving out so many resources?

Yan Tianchen was briefly stunned because he had never considered that before.

“The Nirvana Banquet is used to nurture geniuses in music dao, waiting for someone to grasp the legendary Celestial Tone. They have been doing this for the past few millennia. Not only the Four Musical Houses, but the ten musical clans all have a relationship with the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion.” Mu Xueling said.

“Celestial Tone?” Yan Tianchen was shocked. “How is that possible? No one has grasped the Celestial Tone, even in ancient times. No one can be sure if it even exists.”

“This is the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion’s issue. You guys just have to know that if you display enough talent, the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion won’t hesitate in their rewards. The first at the Nirvana Banquet will be invited to the Nirvana Treasury, and the resources there aren’t what you can imagine. Don’t belittle the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion’s foundation, especially since they could stand above all the forces in the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea.”

“The Nirvana Treasury!” Yan Tianchen’s pupils had flames blazing within. He said, “I heard they have a winery that has countless Dragon Clan wines, Mo Clan’s Millennium Flame, and even the legendary Lunar Incineration Wine brewed by deities.”

Dragon Clan wines? Millennium Flame? Lunar Incineration Wine? Lin Yun was attracted to those words and had a stronger feeling that the Heavenly Nirvana Banquet was related to the Azure Dragon’s lineage.

“What are you guys talking about?” A figure chuckled as she descended from the sky. She was Yue Weiwei, who was done practicing the Nine Heavenly Profound Dance. She asked her question when she saw Lin Yun in deep thought.

“The Nirvana Banquet.” Lin Yun smiled when he came to his senses.

“There are only seven days left. Senior Brother, is this the reason why you came back?” Yue Weiwei turned to look at Yan Tianchen.

Yan Tianchen nodded. He was an attentive person. With just a glance, he discovered that the relationship between Lin Yun and Yue Weiwei wasn’t simple. They stood close together, as if it was natural for them. Yue Weiwei seemed closer to Lin Yun than Saint Elder, which shocked him.

His junior sister fell for this brat? He had been acquainted with Yue Weiwei for a year and naturally knew her personality. She would wear a smile when interacting with anyone but would also maintain her distance from everyone. This distance she maintained wasn’t rude, but it also wouldn’t allow anyone to get close to her.

“There are only seven days left. Junior Sister, you don’t have to work so hard, so rest well. The meaning isn’t great now.” Yan Tianchen squeezed out a smile despite the bitterness in his heart. Before anyone could reply, he had already left.

This shocked everyone and they could sense that the atmosphere wasn’t right. Lin Yun looked at Yan Tianchen’s silhouette and fell into deep thoughts. As a man, he roughly knew the reason why.

“Tianchen is right. Only seven days are left, so it’s pointless to continue practicing. You two can rest well during this period.” Mu Xueling said.

When Mu Xueling left, Yue Weiwei sighed, “Senior Brother is a good person. Big Brother Lin, did you make him angry earlier?”

“Uhh… Probably…” Lin Yun rubbed his nose. Now that he thought about it again, Yan Tianchen did nothing, but his attitude towards him wasn’t good. Reflecting on it, it was totally unnecessary.

“Hmph, I already guessed it. No next time.” Yue Weiwei said to Lin Yun.

Lin Yun merely replied with a smile, and he didn’t know how to explain.

At night, Lin Yun practiced his sword in the courtyard. His sword was slow, but each movement contained boundless profundity. The massive aura fused with the surrounding space formed a majestic trend.

Simultaneously, Lin Yun’s vitality began to rumble with a dragon roar echoing from his body. As a hundred thousand dragon runes wandered on the surface of his body, they released a powerful dragon aura, and each sword contained the divine dragon’s power.

This was the Blue Dragon Skybreaking Art. After it reached the third stage, it would affect his aura and pressure all the time. No matter what sword technique Lin Yun practiced, it would slowly strengthen his physique.

Although the number of dragon runes did not increase, Lin Yun could sense that his physique was constantly becoming stronger. Upon reaching the fourth stage, the Azure Dragon Saint Art and Blue Dragon Skybreaking Art could fuse together. His Azure Dragon Saint Art might undergo a drastic transformation at that time.

Right then, a figure landed on the wall. He asked, “Junior Brother Lin, can we talk?”

This person was Yan Tianchen, holding onto a wine jar and looking at Lin Yun. When Lin Yun raised his head, he could see that Yan Tianchen’s hair was unkept, and he no longer had the previous ethereal temperament. Lin Yun was stunned because he never expected Yan Tianchen to get wasted.

“Senior Brother, come down and speak.” Lin Yun said after coming to his senses.

As Yan Tianchen jumped down from the wall, he poured a cup of wine for Lin Yun and smiled, “Do you drink?”

“Of course.” Lin Yun gulped down the wine in one go. Looking at the cup, he said, “Not bad.”

“I brought it from the divine mountain, but it’s nothing compared to the Myriad Flowers Wine Saint Elder gave you. Even so, this is also an extraordinary wine.” Yan Tianchen smiled.

“You know about me so well?” Lin Yun was surprised. He never expected Yan Tianchen would go and find out something that happened so long ago.

Wearing a bitter smile, Yan Tianchen replied, “You already played the Ni Chang Dress Song for Junior Sister, so I naturally have to find out about you. But you’re impressive and can be considered a legend within the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion. Not only did you give Elder Jiang a beating on your first day here, you teased Saint Elder and even dared to teach Saint Elder how to play the zither. But that wasn’t all. You even sneaked into the West Garden Banquet alone and challenged everyone.”

The corner of Lin Yun’s lip twitched, but he could sense the complicated emotions in Yan Tianchen’s tone.

“Treat Junior Sister well.” Yan Tianchen suddenly said. “I know I don’t have the qualifications to say that, but she is a kind girl. I’ve never seen her so intimate with someone, so you two must’ve experienced a lot.”

“It’s fine. I understand what you mean.” Lin Yun was briefly stunned. He didn’t know that Yan Tianchen was also such a devoted person.

Yan Tianchen smiled, “Let’s not talk about that. Do you think the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion has a high chance during the Nirvana Banquet?”

“I’m not sure about that. I don’t understand the three other musical houses much, not to mention the six holy lands and musical clans.” Lin Yun replied. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“You’re being too humble. I can sense that you’re strong, and anyone who belittles you will die a terrible death.” Yan Tianchen said.

Lin Yun didn’t respond, but didn’t know how to answer that.

“No matter who we run into, even if we face someone from the ten musical houses, I will do my best and try to bring us as far as we can.” Yan Tianchen sighed. “The Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion has lost too many times. If we’re at the bottom again, it will a great blow to the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s reputation, and many people might leave.”

Lin Yun could tell Yan Tianchen had strong feelings for the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion. For some reason, he saw a similarity between Yan Tianchen and the chief disciple of the Sword Sect, Gu Ruochen.

“Senior Brother, you’re too overly concerned.” Lin Yun persuaded.

“I’m not.” Yan Tianchen shook his head and continued to drink with Lin Yun. When the moon climbed up in the sky, Yan Tianchen was already wasted, and Lin Yun couldn’t wake him, no matter how he tried. Yue Weiwei descended from the sky when he wanted to carry Yan Tianchen to the room.

“What’s wrong with Senior Brother?” Yue Weiwei was first alarmed before she quickly descended to the ground. When she discovered that Yan Tianchen was drunk, she breathed a sigh of relief.

Lin Yun told Yue Weiwei about his conversation with Yan Tianchen. When Yue Weiwei heard what Lin Yun said, she sighed, “Senior Brother actually has a lot weighing on his heart. There are no talents in the current generation of the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion. Before my Senior Sister and I came, he was the only one who grasped the Great Saint Tone amongst those of the same generation.”

Lin Yun knew well that the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion would probably be embarrassed by the Exquisite Court if he wasn't around.

“I’m surprised that he can come back alive.” Yue Weiwei said.

“What do you mean by that?” Lin Yun asked.

“With the approaching Nirvana Banquet, he probably entered the Divine Blood Purgatory on the divine mountain to quickly gain strength. That place is so dangerous that even disciples of the divine mountain are afraid of it.” Yue Weiwei’s pupils flashed with fear.

Lin Yun turned around and looked at Yan Tianchen. He really didn’t expect Yan Tianchen to bear it all on his shoulders, just so that everyone could enjoy a peaceful time here, and he had no one to rely on in the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion.
