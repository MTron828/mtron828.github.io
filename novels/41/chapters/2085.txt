Chapter 2086: Heartbroken

The sudden change of events shocked many people. This newcomer was donning an indigo robe, her hair draped down like a waterfall. But the most terrifying aspect was the wisp of imperial aura in her sword ray. That was the aura of an emperor, and it made her hair emit a faint glow.

With one sword, this woman heavily injured seven Azure Origin Phase Quasi-Saints, with the three Indigo Origin Phase Quasi-Saints being hindered. They were intimidated by her roar and didn’t dare to step forth.

This woman who was donned in an indigo robe had an oval face. She was wielding a saint sword, had a pendant hanging from her waist, and wore an indigo ice phoenix bracelet on the wrist of the hand she held her sword with. Her expression was as cold as ice with a noble temperament, and anyone could tell she wasn’t easy to get close to at first glance.

“Who the hell are you? How dare?you interfere in the affairs of the Sword Alliance. Don’t you know our identity?” The three Indigo Origin Phase Quasi-Saints could sense that this woman wasn’t a pushover and might have a huge origin. Thus, they immediately reported their background, hoping to intimidate her.

“Get lost!” The woman looked at the three Indigo Origin Phase Quasi-Saints and wasn’t polite with her tone.

“You’re courting death!”

“Don’t you have any?manners despite your young age? Not only have you injured the Quasi-Saints of my Sword Alliance, but you even dare to be rude to us?!” The three Indigo Origin Phase Quasi-Saints were furious. As flames of rage blazed within their pupils, they charged at the woman together.

Indigo saint radiance exploded from the woman. Not only was the aura she gave off not restricted by the three Indigo Origin Phase Quasi-Saints, it had even made them feel terrible. The three Indigo Origin Phase Quasi-Saints were shocked as they exclaimed, “Great Dao Flower!”

Three thousand great daos and countless lesser daos. The lesser daos were easier to comprehend than the great daos. This was why there was such a huge difference in their strengths despite being at the same cultivation.

There were countless lesser daos in the world, and anyone could easily comprehend four to five lesser daos as long as they were observant enough and had enough time. But great daos were an entirely different story. It wasn’t easy to comprehend a great dao, and it required high talent for one to succeed in comprehending a great dao.

But that wasn’t all. The Indigo Origin Phase Quasi-Saints were shocked because the woman only exhibited a great dao, and just one great dao was already so terrifying. This meant that her strength was only the tip of the iceberg, and this might be her weakest saint dao.

The three Indigo Origin Phase Quasi-Saints’ foreheads were covered in sweat with fear in their hearts. They were curious about who this woman was, but they were placed in a difficult position. They couldn’t take another step forth with this woman standing before them.

They and everyone else present were also curious about this mysterious woman’s identity.

“Why does she seem so familiar…?” Gu Zijing frowned. He found this mysterious woman somewhat familiar. But he was soon shocked by his thoughts because if this woman was that?Highness, why would she protect Ye Qingtian? This was unimaginable, and he immediately tossed this thought to the back of his mind.

But when he mentioned that this woman looked familiar, Jiang Yunting immediately turned over and asked, “You also find her familiar?”

Gu Zijing and Jiang Yunting were stunned and could see the shock in each other’s eyes. It might be a misperception if one of them found her familiar, but it should be unmistakable now that they shared the same thoughts.

They could immediately feel that their scalps were going numb.

Right then, an Indigo-Golden Dragon appeared from the woman, sending the three Indigo Origin Phase Quasi-Saints flying away.

“Is this the best the three of you can do?” The woman sheathed her sword while hovering in the air, emitting a faint saint radiance and imperial aura.

“Holy shit, it’s really that?Highness. Quick! Get into the carriage!” Gu Zijing no longer dared to delay; even Jiang Yunting was scared silly.

Discussions came from the surrounding area as everyone became curious about this woman’s identity since she was able to easily repel the three Indigo Origin Phase Quasi-Saints at such a young age.

The three Indigo Origin Phase Quasi-Saints were heavily injured as they laid on the ground. Seeing this, the three Heavenly Origin Phase Quasi-Saints from the Misty Rain Manor, Soaring Cloud Sect, and Aquamoon Sword Mountain finally couldn’t maintain their composure any longer.

When they came forth and raised their heads to look at the woman, they felt an invisible pressure enveloping them, bringing out the fear in their hearts, which naturally baffled them. “What’s going on?”

“Stop!” A roar echoed as Gu Zijing descended from his carriage with Jiang Yunting. “No one is allowed to make a move!”

Gu Zijing said coldly, stopping the three holy lands from approaching before he turned around and went down on one knee with Jiang Yunting.

“Snowfrost Saint Palace’s Gu Zijing and Myriad Sword Pavilion’s Jiang Yunting pays our respects to the Ninth Princess!” The two cupped their fists together with their heads lowered, looking nervous.

Even if the Sword Alliance was united, the Snowfrost Saint Palace and Myriad Sword Pavilion would be in deep trouble if they provoked her.

The Ninth Princess? The three Heavenly Origin Phase Quasi-Saints were briefly stunned before their faces changed. When they looked at the dragon coiling around the woman, their faces became pale, their feet trembling.

That was the Indigo-Golden Divine Dragon. Aside from the Ninth Princess, who else in this world possessed the Indigo-Golden Divine Dragon’s bloodline? They now realized why she was giving off such a powerful imperial aura.

Right then, the ground began to tremble from countless galloping horses. A torrent of murderous intent also swept out as a crimson tide barged onto the battlefield. Their appearance made heaven and earth seem like they were dyed in blood.

“Mhm?” Mu Chuang and the Indigothunder Peak Master separated from their opponents when they saw this scene.

“What’s going on?” The Indigothunder Peak Master asked.

“The Divine Dragon Army’s Blood Word Battalion!” Mu Chuan muttered with his face slightly changed. In the next moment, a battalion riding a ferocious beast appeared. They were donning crimson armor and masks while carrying a flag that was fluttering in the wind.

“The Blood Word Battalion!”

“That’s the strongest battalion of the Divine Dragon Army. Aren’t they the guards of the Ninth Princess? Why are they here?”

“This is weird. Wasn’t the Blood Word Battalion exterminating the barbarians from the Voodoo Cult and rarely left the Southern Border?”

“That person?” Many people were surprised when they heard that.

Seven holy lands have sealed the surrounding area, but the charge of the Blood Word Battalion opened up a path. The battalion didn’t take long to reach Lin Yun.

The one leading the Blood Word Battalion rode a demonic beast with dragon horns. He removed his mask, revealing a pale face enveloped in a murderous aura. It was a face that was rid of emotions. If Lin Yun wasn’t cultivating, he would definitely be able to recognize this person. This person was titled White from the Sword Firmament Pavilion, Bai Lixuan.

Two people were beside Bai Lixuan, a monk carrying a jar of wine with a faint smile and a white-clothed youth carrying an ancient zither on his back, Mei Zihua. These two weren’t donned in crimson armor, making them stand out in the Blood Word Battalion.

“Dismount!” Bai Lixuan ordered as the Blood Word Battalion got off their mount. Then, Bai Lixuan fell on one knee and roared, “Salute!”

““We greet the Ninth Princess!””

Everyone from the Blood Word Battalion roared, echoing between heaven and earth.

This left the three Heavenly Origin Phase Quasi-Saints in shock with their jaws wide open. They were stumped for a long time before they quickly paid their respects, with beads of sweat covering their foreheads and their legs trembling. They were nervous while continually wiping their foreheads with their backs covered in sweat.

The woman standing before them was the Ninth Princess. If they made a move against her and anything happened to her, even the Sword Alliance might not be able to bear the Divine Dragon Empire’s fury, not to mention the holy lands present. They couldn’t imagine how terrifying it would become if the Divine Dragon Empire turned their spears to them.

The indigo-clothed woman glanced back as Bai Lixuan stood up from the ground with the Blood Word Battalion.

“You people aren’t from the Divine Dragon Empire. So there’s no need to bow to me,” the indigo-clothed woman said as she looked at Gu Zijing.

“No, no, no. They didn’t know anything and attacked Your Highness rashly. They can’t represent the Sword Alliance, so please forgive us for it.” Gu Zijing took charge and took responsibility for this matter, looking humble as he feared the Sword Alliance might be in trouble.

“Back down,” the indigo-clothed woman said, waving her hand.

The Blood Word Battalion stepped forth and surrounded the wine table in circles, isolating it from everyone else.

When Gu Zijing and the others backed down, they sighed in relief because they knew this was finally over. But he and Jiang Yunting couldn’t figure out how Ye Qingtian got involved with the Ninth Princess.

After all, the Divine Dragon Empire’s Ninth Princess was one of the three most dazzling women within the Kunlun Realm, possessing a high status in the royal clan, and even the Empress favored her.

It was no wonder why the three holy lands didn’t realize she was the Ninth Princess since she stood out to protect Ye Qingtian. Even Gu Zijing didn’t think of it at first. After all, Gu Zijing had only seen her from afar, and they hadn’t interacted before.

“Holy shit. No one will dare to provoke Ye Qingtian now,” Jiang Yunting said. “If anyone dares to go after the Sovereign Saint Sword, they would probably die a horrible death.”

“Zhao Wuji died in vain,” Gu Zijing also felt complicated. He already guessed that Ye Qingtian must have been confident to leave since he dared to come for the Sovereign Saint Sword. But he never expected that Ye Qingtian’s source of confidence would have such a huge background.

Right then, Lin Yun opened his eyes at the table and the two sword stars and thirty-six galaxies entered his body. He had failed to reach the tenth transformation of the Nirvana Stage this time.

When he raised his head to look at the indigo-clothed woman, he couldn’t conceal the surprise on his face. He knew that something had happened in the outside world, but he didn’t know who the newcomer was since he was focused on making a breakthrough.

But when he saw the indigo-clothed woman, he couldn’t contain his shock because this woman was Su Ziyao.

It had been a long time since he said his farewell to Su Ziyao at the Fleeting Cloud Sect.

Su Ziyao nodded then landed on a golden dragon horse not too far away. She pulled the leash and turned to the stumped Lin Yun, “Get on the horse!”

Lin Yun smiled and grabbed the Flower Burial Sword bfore landing behind Su Ziyao.

This made Su Ziyao unhappy as she said, “I’m telling you to get on the horse beside?me!”

“I know, but I like this horse better!” Lin Yun smiled as he embraced Su Ziyao’s waist and held the leash with his right hand. Su Ziyao didn’t resist and let go of the leash, relinquishing control of the horse to Lin Yun.

“Let’s go!” Lin Yun laughed as the horse began to gallop. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Everyone from the Blood Word Battalion and even Bai Lixuan was shocked to see this scene. But a moment later, Bai Lixuan came to his senses and said, “Follow up!”

The initially smiling Drifting Goblet had his smile frozen as he said bitterly, “My heart is broken… I should’ve known it was him!”

He and the sounds of others’ hearts shattering could be heard in the surrounding area.

Mei Zihua was also shocked before he asked, “Who’s he?”

“Ask her yourself,” Drifting Goblet rolled his eyes at Mei Zihua.

This made Mei Zihua anxious because he didn’t dare to even ask Su Ziyao about it.

Far away, Jiang Yunting and Gu Zijing were also dumbfounded, with their jaws dropping. They wondered if they were hallucinating as they looked at Ye Qingtian and the Ninth Princess sitting on the same horse with Ye Qingtian embracing her waist.
