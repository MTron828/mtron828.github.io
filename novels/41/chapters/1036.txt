Chapter 1037 - Not On The Ranking

He Qianfan was even more arrogant than rumored. Although Lin Yun wasn’t on the ranking, his strength had already been acknowledged by everyone. There were no weaklings among the Ten War Realms since they were all at least in the purple ranking. Plus, the head generals could even make the top twenty of the purple ranking.

But even so, He Qianfan acted arrogantly towards Lin Yun. No one dared to belittle Lin Yun, but no one dared to ignore He Qianfan either. He Qianfan’s sudden attack was clearly an act of displaying his strength.

He Qianfan was already in the fifth soul Heavenly Soul Realm. However, no one could tell how much strength he used with his palm. Suddenly, the atmosphere became tense as everyone had some anticipation in their heart.

After all, they all heard about how Lin Yun destroyed three war realms. Since none of them had seen Lin Yun fight, they couldn’t wait to see what would happen. Many people even speculated if Lin Yun had used an elixir or treasure to sweep through the twelve generals. If so, he wasn’t as strong as rumored.

“You don’t want the invitation? Lin Yun, I guarantee that you’ll be interested in the invitation.” He Qianfan smiled. “Either take a palm from me or get on your knees and beg for the invitation.”

Despite He Qianfan’s provocation, Lin Yun didn’t pay him any attention. He was focused on tending to Pei Xue’s wounds first. Seeing her heavy injuries, he knew that He Qianfan purposefully attacked Pei Xue. He Qianfan secretly accumulated his energy and didn’t reveal any enmity to catch her off guard. This made Lin Yun angry. After he was done examining Pei Xue’s injuries, he turned to look at He Qianfan, “Did the three Realm Sons send you?”

He Qianfan was surprised when he heard that because he never expected that Lin Yun would guess it so quickly. He was, indeed, tasked by the Realm Sons.

“You’re ranked ninth on the purple ranking, so why are you acting like a dog?” Lin Yun looked at He Qianfan as if he was stating a fact.

“A wise man submits to his circumstances,” He Qianfan replied. “We will surely descend onto Kunlun Realm in the future. You’ll realize the difference between yourself and the Realm Sons when that happens. You have no idea how terrifying the foundations of the war realms are. Only an idiot like you would dare to provoke them.”

“Leave the invitation behind. Then, you can leave,” replied Lin Yun.

“Didn’t I tell you that you have to take a palm from me if you want it!” He Qianfan barked as the smile disappeared from his face. He could sense that Lin Yun thought nothing of him, which made him furious. After all, he was a monstrous genius who had made two breakthroughs in a row. On the other hand, Lin Yun was an imbecile from the lower realm.

“Flower Burial? I bet you’re afraid that you’ll embarrass yourself!”

“Brother He is giving you this opportunity because he’s giving you face. Otherwise, why would he waste his time?” A few people behind He Qianfan spoke out.

Lin Yun didn't have a good temper, and he was already upset that He Qianfan hit Pei Xue with a sneak attack right in front of him. But this was Four Phase City and many experts from powerful sects were here. In a way, Lin Yun was restrained. Plus, he wanted to know what this so-called invitation was about. After a brief moment of hesitation, he replied, “Sure. But I’m not fond of a one-sided exchange.” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“You want a spar? As you wish!” He Qianfan grinned. He didn’t think that Lin Yun could win against him because Lin Yun was only in the pinnacle third soul Heavenly Soul Realm.

He Qianfan unleashed his aura and Lin Yun followed suit. Lin Yun didn’t underestimate He Qianfan as he executed the Azure Dragon Saint Art. A shining brilliance came from the Azure Dragon True Bone that formed armor around Lin Yun.

Sensing the dragon aura coming from Lin Yun, He Qianfan squinted his eyes, “An Azure Dragon True Bone! You’re really lucky, but I’m also someone with great fortune! Draw your sword!”

“You must be dreaming. I don’t need to draw my sword to face you,” replied Lin Yun.

When He Qianfan heard that, he could sense the contempt Lin Yun had for him. With no intention to go easy on him, He Qianfan instantly brought out his strongest martial technique, an imperial fortune martial technique called the Thunder Star Dragon Palm. “How arrogant! Then let me show you the strength of someone ranked ninth on the purple ranking!”

Light flowed out of his palm as he appeared right in front of Lin Yun.

Lin Yun squinted his eyes after this happened because he could see that He Qianfan deserved his ranking. After all, He Qianfan wasn’t far from complete mastery in his imperial fortune martial technique. In other words, He Qianfan wasn’t any weaker than Lin Yun when he had just come out of the Azure Dragon Palace.

If it was the old Lin Yun, he might have been suppressed after ten moves. However, he wasn’t the same person anymore. To him, fortune martial techniques were no different from zombies without spirits.

Lin Yun merely waved his hand and casually took the attack head-on.

“What’s going on?!” This scene instantly made He Qianfan’s face change because he refused to believe that his imperial fortune martial technique could be so easily blocked. Taking a few steps back, He Qianfan threw out more palms.

With eight of his killing attacks flying out, lightning rumbled with a dragon roar echoing in the surroundings. But Lin Yun didn’t even budge as he easily dealt with He Qianfan’s attacks. The bizarre scene left the spectators dumbfounded.

In their view, Lin Yun was like a towering tree that couldn’t be shaken by He Qianfan’s attacks. From this alone, anyone could tell that they weren’t on the same level. But He Qianfan had already used an imperial fortune martial technique, so how strong was Lin Yun?

Lin Yun gently raised his hand and blocked another one of He Qianfan’s attacks. At the same time, boundless energy burst out of Lin Yun’s armor that pushed He Qianfan away.

“You’ve used a total of nine moves. It’s my turn now.” Lin Yun wasn’t interested in playing with He Qianfan and he wanted to see what the invitation was about.

“I’ll take a palm from you head-on then!” He Qianfan flew into a rage as his face changed. He was so angry that he couldn’t even force Lin Yun to use both hands. He knew that there was a huge difference between them, but he was confident that he could take a palm from Lin Yun head-on.

But before he could even respond, Lin Yun had already appeared before He Qianfan. Then, Lin Yun swung his palm towards He Qianfan’s face. The palm was ordinary, but it gave off a feeling that all of the light in heaven and earth was being devoured. Just by standing, Lin Yun looked like a domineering overlord.

Lin Yun didn’t use any martial techniques behind his attack. He simply infused some of his comprehension into his palm. It was a small bit of his holy spirit martial technique, but it was more than enough to deal with someone like He Qianfan.

His palm instantly crushed the origin energy enveloping He Qianfan. Just like that, He Qianfan was sent flying away before he crashed into the ground. Throwing up blood, He Qianfan knelt on the ground as his face distorted from the pain.

When the spectators saw this scene, the hairs on their arms began to stand. No one could believe that He Qianfan lost so terribly after one move. No one would dare to suspect Lin Yun’s strength anymore.

When they looked at Lin Yun again, they felt a huge blow in their hearts. Lin Yun’s name wasn’t even on the ranking, but his presence was suffocating. In the purple ranking, he was probably invincible.

Then, Lin Yun waved his hand and grabbed onto the invitation from afar with three words on it written in blood, Demon Slaughtering Assembly!
