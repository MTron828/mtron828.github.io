Chapter 2283 - We Welcome Flower Burial!

Lin Yun didn’t think much more as he turned around, not bothered with Wang Muyan’s life and death, nor did he intend to chase after her. This was mainly because he couldn’t be distracted while maintaining the restriction on the divine flame fragment. He needed to leave the Heavenly Void quickly now that he had obtained the divine flame fragment.

He passed through the space-time distortion and fireballs as he returned to the Flame Dragon’s skull. The Flame Dragon Valley had been destroyed along with the entire space there. Countless spatial fragments flew around, with the surrounding space being distorted. One might feel that they're facing upwards, when they could be facing downwards. Time distortion was even more terrifying because half of their body might become aged if they were caught in it while the other half remained youthful.

The time and space seals the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda set up were destroyed. Then again, this was also because they were in the Heavenly Void. If they were outside the God Burial Mountain Range, it wouldn’t be so easy to cause a space and time distortion.

The space and time here weren’t stable due to the battle of deities in ancient times. This was why those with a cultivation higher than a fifth-stage Saint Lord couldn’t step in. Lin Yun couldn’t recognize his location, so he could only roughly detect the Flame Dragon’s location.

While Lin Yun was baffled, flames soared to the sky before a golden ocean appeared with a lotus shining on the ocean, resisting the space and time distortion.

“It’s Li Feibai!” Lin Yun quickly guessed that Li Feibai must have used the Sovereign Constellation to direct him to their location. The surrounding time and space were distorted, but Lin Yun could see the location of the lotus. As a result, he didn’t have to worry about losing his way.

Just when Lin Yun was going to move, a golden phoenix flew out, clearing a path out. This brought a smile to Lin Yun’s face since he instantly figured out that Ji Zixi was opening a path for him, afraid he wouldn’t be able to return. “It’s that lass.”

Flute music resounded next, which was clear in the turbulence. This made Lin Yun feel warm since this music came from Qu Wushuang. This showed that they were all worried about his return. He squinted and said, “It looks like I’ve been looked down upon…”

Then again, that was only a joke because it wasn’t a problem for him to return based on his strength. It's just that it would be slightly more troublesome. But with so much help, it would be much easier for him. Lin Yun returned to the Flame Dragon’s skeleton in just a few minutes.

When he lowered his head, he saw Qu Wushuang playing the flute on the Flame Dragon’s skull. Li Feibai was seated with her eyes closed, trying to maintain her Sovereign Constellation. As for Ji Zixi, she was doing her best to control the Divine Phoenix Mirror to create a safe passage.

“Flower Burial is back!”

“He also retrieved the divine flame fragment!”

Over three hundred people were standing on the Flame Dragon’s skeleton, cheering with excitement on their faces.

Lin Yun smiled as he spread his arms and descended onto the Flame Dragon’s skeleton. His long hair fluttered as he descended, looking like a Saint Lord despite not being one. Lin Yun won over all the cultivators on the Flame Dragon’s skeleton. They had politely cupped their fists together. As they bowed, they said in unison, "“We welcome Flower Burial’s return!”"

Lin Yun had saved them twice. The first time was when he sealed all the demonic corpses with his sword intent before saving them when they fell into the abyss created by spatial distortion. Even the most heartless person would feel grateful for Lin Yun, and they spoke from the bottom of their hearts.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The unified voices were loud, which left Lin Yun shocked when they bowed.

“A young hero.” The weak Astral River Saint Lord stroked his beard as he exclaimed, watching this scene. He had lived a long life and had seen the Radiant Sword Saint’s grace when he was young. Looking at Lin Yun now, he believes that Lin Yun had surpassed his master when he was the same age. The Astral River Saint Lord sighed, “As expected of the Radiant’s lineage…”

Once Lin Yun descended, Qu Wushuang stowed the flute and cupped his fists together at Lin Yun, to which Lin Yun smiled and returned the gesture. With that, the grudge that they had in the past was resolved.

“Big Brother Lin, you’re finally back!” Ji Zixi rejoiced as she stowed the Divine Phoenix Mirror.

“You’re finally back. It looks like we didn’t try so hard for nothing,” Li Feibai said as she came over.

“Why did you guys think that I can’t return?” Lin Yun smiled.

Li Feibai examined Lin Yun, and said with disdain, “Don’t you know about the reason?”

“Young Master Li said that you’re a Holy Maiden Killer, and she’s afraid that you might get charmed by that demoness,” Ji Zixi smiled.

Li Feibai smiled, “You’re the one who was worried, not me. You only had to clear out a passage, but you cleared over a hundred passages. What’s the matter? Were you really afraid that your Big Brother Lin would leave with that demoness?”

“What are you talking about?!” Ji Zixi said with a blush on her face.

“Here, you can have this,” Lin Yun smiled as he handed the divine flame fragment over, shocking everyone in the surroundings.

“Young Master Lin!” The Saint Elders of the Divine Phoenix Mountain, including the Astral River Saint Lord, couldn’t maintain their composure when they saw this. Even Ji Zixi looked at Lin Yun with disbelief. Lin Yun risked his life to retrieve the divine flame fragment just for her.

“This…” Ji Zixi contemplated, wanting to say she didn’t need it. She couldn’t decide, so she turned to look at the Astral River Saint Lord, “Uncle Xinghe…”

The Astral River Saint Lord came forth, looking at Lin Yun, “Isn’t this a little too valuable?”

The Astral River Saint Lord was agitated but had done his best to restrain himself.

Lin Yun smiled, “Stop pretending. I've already noticed that you’re not that simple, since you took such a huge risk to enter the Heavenly Void. You must have objectives for the divine flame fragment that are different from the other holy lands. So take it!”

Lin Yun slowly undid the restriction, and smiled, “You wanted me to visit the Divine Phoenix Mountain, so consider this a gift. Furthermore, I’m also willing to maintain a friendship with the Divine Phoenix Mountain, so I’m not giving this to you guys for free.”

If the Divine Phoenix Mountain could come when his master undergoes his tribulation, it would be a great help. Lin Yun was straightforward with his intentions and didn’t bother concealing them.

“Really? You have to come, then!” Ji Zixi rejoiced with excitement on her face. She had been looking forward to Lin Yun taking a trip to the Divine Phoenix Mountain, but he never came despite agreeing to it. So when she heard what Lin Yun said, she couldn’t help being overjoyed.

The Astral River Saint Lord said nothing as he looked at Lin Yun deeply. Ji Zixi didn’t hear the hidden meaning in Lin Yun’s words, but the Astral River Saint Lord did. This was the reason why he couldn’t help feeling a little worried. He smiled, “This favor is a little too heavy.”

“Don’t worry. I won’t force anyone. It’s enough as long as the Divine Phoenix Mountain remembers this favor,” Lin Yun smiled. He genuinely wanted to befriend the Divine Phoenix Mountain and wouldn’t force them to repay him. This had always been how he did things. If someone helped him, he would repay them tenfold in the future, but he wouldn’t force them if they weren’t willing.

“Haha, I’m sorry for misunderstanding you.” The Astral River Saint Lord had guilt on his face as he cupped his fists together.

Lin Yun smiled and accepted the Astral River Saint Lord’s apology. With that, the divine flame fragment went to Ji Zixi while promising to meet again at the Divine Phoenix Mountain.

“You have to come!” Ji Zixi added, “When we’re out, you should just come with me to the Divine Phoenix Mountain.”

“That’s a good idea,” the Astral River Saint Lord smiled.

“What's the rush? Are you in such a hurry because you want Lin Yun to become the son-in-law of the Divine Phoenix Mountain?” Li Feibai teased. She had returned to her actual self after everything calmed down. When she joked in the past, those from the Divine Phoenix Mountain would look at her unhappily. But when they heard what she said again, they couldn’t help examining Lin Yun as if they were considering her question. Even the Astral River Saint Lord only smiled and had no unhappiness.

“Young Master Lin, can we talk?” Qu Wushuang called out to Lin Yun.

“What is it?” Besides those from the Divine Dao Pavilion, Lin Yun noticed many Saints around Qu Wushuang.

Qu Wushuang smiled, “Well, we’re all saved by you twice, and they wanted me to represent them to give you some gifts as gratitude.”

“Oh?” Lin Yun was shocked upon hearing that.

Qu Wushuang smiled, “I have such intentions as well. This is a ten-thousand-year Saint Elixir, the Qilin Fruit. The Divine Dao Pavilion obtained it in the Heavenly Void.”

“Flower Burial, this is a Heavenly Cloud Herb, a ten-thousand-year Saint Elixir. This is gratitude from the Ancient Saint Clans.”

“Flower Burial, this is a Snowshadow Saint Lotus, gratitude of my Clear Nether Sect.”

With Qu Wushuang taking the lead, everyone came forth with their gifts. Lin Yun could tell with a glance that they were all precious treasures that were hard to find, even in the Heavenly Void.

“Flower Burial, there’s no need to be polite with us and accept them. Without you, we would’ve died a long time ago.” These people were rather optimistic because no treasures could amount to their lives.

Qu Wushuang smiled, “Everyone has some harvest in the Heavenly Void, and we have more treasures. So you can feel free to accept them.”

Lin Yun pondered. He did need resources to make a breakthrough to the Saint Realm, not to mention that it would be rude if he refused their goodwill. He nodded with a smile, “Okay.”

Hearing that Lin Yun agreed, all the Saints heaved a sigh in relief. After all, Lin Yun gave away the divine flame fragment, so they were worried that these Saint Elixirs might not catch Lin Yun’s attention. When Lin Yun accepted the gifts, the atmosphere suddenly became much more friendly, with a group of Saints chatting with Lin Yun.
