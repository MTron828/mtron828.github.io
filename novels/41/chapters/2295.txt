Chapter 2296 - Ninth Princess’ Choice

Seeing Ji Zixi’s passionate invitation, Last Sky Great Saint smiled, “Don’t be so straightforward. People will think you’re trying to kidnap the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple. If that happens, I’m afraid the Azure River Sword Saint will have an opinion about it.”

Compared to Ji Zixi’s innocence, the Last Sky Great Saint was more experienced and brushed through it with a smile.

“Haha, that’s too exaggerated.” Ye Guhan smiled, “Since the Last Sky Great Saint has invited my junior brother, he can just directly head to the Divine Phoenix Mountain instead of returning to the Heavenly Dao Sect.”

Lin Yun already had such plans and took out the Divine Blood Fruit before giving it to Ye Guhan. He said, “I’ll have to trouble Senior Brother to give this to my master.”

Ye Guhan was stunned and smiled, “It looks like the Dragon Origin is fortunate. This Divine Blood Fruit can even strengthen his cultivation, as well as extend his lifespan. Alright, hand it to me.”

Everyone was shocked as they watched the Divine Blood Fruit being handed over so easily.

“Holy shit, I didn’t expect Lin Yun to also obtain the Divine Blood Fruit as well as the divine flame fragment.”

“Flower Burial is shocking.”

“Haha! His name will spread throughout the Kunlun Realm after today!”

“You should address him as Flower Burial Sword Saint now. Even those from the Divine Phoenix Mountain call him that.”

“Hahaha! I still can’t get used to it, since he’s too young. Who can imagine that he’s not even thirty?” Everyone looked at Lin Yun with shock.

Ji Zixi had joy on her face as moved to invite Li Feibai as a guest to the Divine Phoenix Mountain. She held onto Li Feibai’s hand and said, “Big Sister Bai, why don’t you come as well?”

“Young Master Li, are you willing to visit the Divine Phoenix Mountain?” The Last Sky Great Saint invited.

“I don’t mind. But I came to the Heavenly Void for a mission, so I have to return to report the results of my mission,” Li Feibai smiled.

The Last Sky Great Saint asked, “Is it because of the Demonspirit Clan?”

Li Feibai didn’t hide it from everyone and turned to the God Burial Mountain Range. She said, “The Southern Emperor had strengthened the seal three thousand years ago, but the seal has become weak now. It’s almost time for them to break out even if we manage to stop them.”

The Last Sky Great Saint said, “The Heavenly Path is broken, so there’s nothing much they can do.”

“Don’t be so sure about that. The situation in the Heavenly Void isn’t optimistic, according to what I saw. But there’s no need to be anxious about it because the Kunlun Realm isn’t the same as it was three thousand years ago.” Li Feibai looked at Lin Yun, and said, “Three thousand years ago, the Nine Emperors appeared and calmed the chaos. Three thousand years later, there will be heroes who stand out.”

Lin Yun awkwardly smiled, “I never expected that you’d have an objective in the Heavenly Void. But you’re right. According to what I know, the God Burial Mountain Range has more than one Heavenly Void. The Demonspirit Clan has been preparing for many years.”

“There are more things that you can’t imagine. I’ll be taking my leave,” Li Feibai smiled, cupping her fists together. She was the descendant of the Eight Imperial Clans, but she had stayed behind because she was concerned about Lin Yun’s safety. Now that everything had ended with the three holy lands departure, she had nothing to worry about.

“Take care of yourself. I’ll come find you when I’m free,” Lin Yun yelled, looking at Li Feibai’s back figure. After all, they fought together and had each other’s back to one another. That’s why Lin Yun naturally cherished his friendship with Li Feibai.

“Alright,” Li Feibai waved her hand as a form of reply.

“Senior Brother, Last Sky Great Saint, you guys talk while I go and see that… Senior. I’ll be right back.” Lin Yun pointed at Lil’ Purple and flew over.

Ye Guhan held onto his chin, and muttered, “Brother Last Sky, do you know about this… Divine Phoenix Clan’s Supreme Heavenly Slaughter Empress of Four Seas, Eight Barrens, 36 Heavens, and 72 Earths?”

When the Astral River Saint Sovereign and Jade Lotus Saint Sovereign heard that, their faces changed as they hesitated.

The Last Sky Great Saint had no change on his face, but smiled, “ The Kunlun Realm has four seas, the eight barrens should be referring to the eight barren continents, the 36 Heavens, and 72 Earths were controlled by the Eight Imperial Clans. But it’s weird if you’re asking if there’s anyone who can rule them.”

“Stop beating around the bush. Have you heard of her before?” Ye Guhan smiled.

The Last Sky Great Saint bitterly said, “I have, but it’s a secret of my Divine Phoenix Mountain, and I can’t tell you much about it. This is too sudden, and this friend of the Flower Burial Sword Saint must be talking about it casually. It can’t be real.”

Ye Guhan turned his head over and felt it was unreal, too. Not to mention that the other party could barely fend off the Thousand Seal Great Saint, or Lin Yun wouldn’t have asked him for help.

When Lin Yun was halfway over, the three pillars of light gradually dissipated, and he soon found Lil’ Purple on a mountain. It had been some time since they last met, and Lil’ Purple had grown up a lot, caressing Lil’ Red’s head.

Lil’ Red had its eyes closed, looking comfortable. Suddenly, it sensed something, jumped down from Lil’ Purple’s embrace, and ran towards Lin Yun.

With a smile, Lin Yun hugged Lil’ Red, “You’ve gotten heavy.”VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Lil’ Red was fatter than before, looking like a fat cat.

“You scumbag. I risked my life to save you, but you only come now. Were you captivated by the Divine Phoenix Mouintain’s little princess? Don’t forget that your wife is down below,” Lil’ Purple tugged her arms together and said unhappily.

Lin Yun handed Lil’ Red back, and frowned, “How will Ziyao come up now that you’re gone?”

“I didn’t want to either. But Su Ziyao feared that you might be in danger. She had already subdued the hand. So she asked me to quickly come out,” Lil’ Purple said.

“She has subdued the hand?” Lin Yun asked.

“Yeah, but it will take some time for her to refine it…” Lil’ Purple sighed. “You’re really lucky because she has given up on the Blood Word Battalion to refine the hand. She will probably be in trouble when she goes back.”

Lin Yun’s heart sank because he knew that Su Ziyao had chosen him over the Divine Dragon Empire. He said, “I will stand by her side no matter what happens.”

“Alright, let’s not talk about that. Have you promised the Divine Phoenix Mountain to visit them?” Lil’ Purple changed the topic. She knew Lin Yun planned to go to the Divine Phoenix Mountain to seek help for the Sword Sect. The Phoenix Heart Song was an investment that he made back then.

“I did. But I’m unsure what they want or if they will agree to it.” Lin Yun was pretty optimistic about it. He had a good relationship with Ji Zixi, and the Divine Phoenix Mountain tried to protect him earlier. But they would have to consider taking the risk and helping the Radiant Sword Saint in his tribulation, offending Tian Xuanzi in the process.

Lil’ Purple sighed, “You’re too righteous, always thinking for others. You think for others, but who thinks for you? You should grasp a hold of that little princess. Isn’t she one of the three beauties of the Kunlun Realm? Just win her heart! Don’t forget the divine flame fragment. Didn’t they want it? Don’t give it to them yet; only give it to them after they agree.”

After Lil’ Purple said that, she reached her hand out. Seeing this, Lin Yun couldn’t help smiling as he pinched Lil’ Purple’s face, saying, “Since you’re so smart, who have you grasped so far?”

“You only know how to bully me,” Lil’ Purple said unhappily.

“That’s right,” Lin Yun smiled. The two played around as they returned. Along the way, Lin Yun shared his harvest in the Heavenly Void with Lil’ Red. The latter had also received an opportunity in the Fallen God Valley, relying on the Divine Mulberry Tree to reach the Saint Realm.

“I know what you mean, but getting an immortal holy land to take the risk without giving them enough benefits is unrealistic,” Lin Yun said. “As for the divine flame fragment, I didn’t think much about it and already gave it to Ji Zixi.”

“Don’t worry. I’ll help you deal with them,” Lil’ Purple boasted.

“Carry on boasting.” Lin Yun knocked on Lil’ Purple’s head with a smile. She looked pretty adorable when she was boasting.

“Don’t forget who taught you the Phoenix Heart Song,” Lil’ Purple said.

“Yeah, I believe you,” Lin Yun said, but he didn’t treat it seriously. After all, Lil’ Purple was nearly in danger because of what she did earlier and had to rely on Ye Guhan to resolve the issue. Otherwise, she would have suffered if she continued fighting the Thousand Seal Great Saint. At the time, the three Sovereign Divine Runes couldn’t have lasted for much longer. Thinking about it, he smiled, “Speaking of which, was the Ming Cult’s ancestor really your disciple?”

“I don’t know. I don’t have any impression of him, so he’s probably a lackey. I have a high requirement for a disciple,” Lil’ Purple said unhappily.

Lin Yun merely smiled and took it as a joke.

“But I do have some impression about the Divine Phoenix Mountain. I’m a phoenix, and I can easily deal with them,” Lil’ Purple said seriously.

“Yeah, I believe you,” Lin Yun smiled. Right then, two streaks of light flew over. They were Drifting Goblet and Bai Lixuan.

Lil’ Purple said, “Don’t worry. Call them over.”

“Greetings, Senior.” Bai Lixuan cupped his fists together in Lil’ Purple’s direction.

Drifting Goblet was rather casual as he gave a wink to Lin Yun. He asked, “Flower Burial Sword Saint, do you have wine?”

“I don’t have any this time,” Lin Yun smiled.

“That’s a pity.” Drifting Goblet smiled as he turned to look at Lil’ Purple. He asked, “Senior, you said that the Ninth Princess has something to tell us. Can we know about it now?”

Lil’ Purple said, “The Ninth Princess said not to wait for her. She won’t return to the Blood Word Battalion this time and will bear the consequences.”

Bai Lixuan’s face changed when he heard that. Even the Drifting Goblet’s face became grave with his smile disappearing.
