Chapter 1492 - Alright!

An Liuyan was briefly stunned upon hearing that before she asked, “Lin Yun, what did you say earlier?” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“A ten thousand-year exotic flower.”

“Before that.”

“I said…” Lin Yun stopped halfway and saw An Liuyan looking at him with a smile.

“Carry on.” An Liuyan said with a charming smile.

“I said that trouble doesn’t only come with traveling with a beauty, but we’re pretty lucky as well.” Lin Yun smiled.

“Hehe.” An Liuyan smiled with her eyes squinted.

This made Lin Yun wonder if she was a fool. But he soon diverted his gaze to the surroundings to try and sense that exotic flower through the Flower Burial Sword. But he couldn’t find it with his naked eyes, which meant that the exotic flower probably had a camouflage ability and merged with the surroundings.

Refusing to believe he couldn’t find it, Lin Yun closed his eyes and activated the Golden Crow Saint Rune in his profound palace. Accurately speaking, he could also be considered a saint spiritualist, it’s just that he wasn’t that legit.

After his soul energy started to pour out, he still couldn’t find that exotic flower while relying on it alone. He then fused his sword intent with his soul energy. In the next second, a bizarre ripple appeared in his senses.

When he opened his eyes, he waved his right hand, and the Flower Burial Sword flew out from his sword box. When the Flower Burial Sword reappeared, he stabbed it into the ground, creating a crack and revealed a golden flower with a height of ten meters.

“Gold Flowlight Flower…” Lin Yun muttered as he looked at it. He had obtained it before, but that one was only a thousand years old. This one might have reached ten thousand years. It wasn’t only exotic, it even had intelligence, possessing extraordinary strength.

The Gold Flowlight Flower desperately struggled, but the Flower Burial Sword firmly suppressed it. As light flowed on the runes of the sword, the surrounding floral aroma poured into it.

As Lin Yun made another seal, his two sword souls flew out from the center of his brows. When the two sword souls empowered the Flower Burial Sword, the power of the sword skyrocketed, and Lin Yun muttered, “Devour!”

The devouring speed of the Flower Burial Sword increased. When the Flower Burial Sword devoured the floral aroma, it gradually became sharper, and the runes on the sword gradually lit up.

“What is the name of this sword?” An Liuyan asked curiously.

“Flower Burial.” Lin Yun replied as he looked at the sword. The Gold Flowlight Flower was desperately struggling, but he barely maintained this state, even under the empowerment of his dual sword souls. But this also meant that the Flower Burial Sword would greatly benefit from this after devouring the flower.

“Do you need help?” An Liuyan asked upon seeing how taxing it was for Lin Yun to maintain this state.

“It’s fine.” Lin Yun shook his head. As the Flower Burial Sword continued to devour, the Gold Flowlight Flower gradually shrunk in size, and it was barely a meter tall after four hours. Seeing this scene, Lin Yun breathed a sigh of relief. Looking at the crack beneath him, he retreated to a few hundred meters away with his hands on his knees, while his dual sword souls returned to the center of his brow.

Letting out a breath, Lin Yun slowly closed his eyes and circulated the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra. This time, An Liuyan clearly saw his dual sword souls, and she now knew why he had such a powerful attainment in the sword. She couldn’t contain the shock in her eyes, shocked by Lin Yun’s talent.

She had been with him for a long time, and she didn’t realize it. Furthermore, Lin Yun didn’t seem short-tempered and arrogant like the rumors. An Liuyan briefly rolled her eyes as a smile rose on her lips while she looked at Lin Yun.

“What a powerful sword ray! There’s actually a saint sword in the riverbed!” Several figures appeared in the distance, and the voice was pretty familiar.

When the three figures appeared, a familiar figure appeared in An Liuyan’s sight. Lan Siyu from the Netherworld Hall, who previously invited her, and the one that exclaimed earlier was the grey-clothed bladesman. When Lan Siyu saw An Liuyan, he rejoiced.

Lin Yun suddenly opened his eyes and grabbed onto An Liuyan’s shoulder before retreating a few hundred meters. When Lan Siyu saw Lin Yun’s hand on An Liuyan’s shoulder, his face immediately sank. It wasn’t easy for him and An Liuyan to run into each other again. So he became annoyed when he saw that piece of trash together with her.

“Young Master, look at that sword!” The grey-clothed bladesman pointed at the Flower Burial Sword with greed flashing in the depth of his pupils. “This is a saint sword forged with metallic wood and must have a terrifying origin. The saint light it was giving off hasn’t dissipated yet!”

The other skinny middle-aged man also had joy on his face, “Young Master Lan, this must be a treasure that survived the previous era. This is a great opportunity, and I have to congratulate Young Master Lan for your luck!”

Lan Siyu was briefly stunned before he rejoiced, “This is a god-sent opportunity. It looks like even heaven is helping me!”

But An Liuyan became anxious because she knew it was Lin Yun’s sword. Just when she wanted to take a step forth, she was stopped by Lin Yun.

“Haha! Cang Mu, go and retrieve that sword for me!” Lan Siyu smiled. When he glanced at Lin Yun from the corner of his eyes, he didn’t put Lin Yun in his heart.

This made An Liuyan grit his teeth with her chest heaving heavily. She couldn’t believe that there was someone who acted so shamelessly!

“Lin Yun, are you not angry? That’s your sword!” An Liuyan transmitted her voice to Lin Yun.

“No one can take my sword away from me. So don’t worry about it and just watch.” Lin Yun calmly replied.

After the grey-clothed bladesman charged forth and appeared above the Flower Burial Sword, he could see five thousand saint runes on the sword and the azure runes engraved on the surface of it. This sword gave him a feeling that it could even tear space apart with a simple swing.

“It’s really a treasure!” Cang Mu’s eyes greedily fell onto the sword and descended from the sky. But just when he was about to grab onto it, saint runes flowed over the sword, and a cut appeared on his palm.

“Interesting.” Cang Mu smiled as he unleashed his blade intent. He wanted to suppress this sword before retrieving it, but his face soon became ugly because he noticed that it was difficult for him to suppress it.

“What are you doing? Go and help him!” Lan Siyu yelled at the skinny middle-aged man who was also a seven-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm expert. This person wore an emerald saint robe that made him give off an extraordinary temperament.

When the two joined forces, the Flower Burial Sword trembled even more, sounding like zither music. In the ears of Lan Siyu, it was that wonderful. This placed him in a good mood as he secretly glanced at Lin Yun.

When he saw Lin Yun standing behind An Liuyan, he couldn’t help the contempt in his pupils. In his view, Lin Yun could only watch as he retrieved the treasure, and An Liuyan would rather stay with such a piece of trash than accept his invitation. So he made up his mind to deal with Lin Yun after he retrieved that sword.

“What’s going on?!”

“My feet!” Right then, the middle-aged man and the bladesman’s faces changed. They could see a layer of mist was enveloping their bodies. In the fog, they could feel their blood flow and astral energy freezing, and they couldn’t move at all. This made their faces change because they couldn’t comprehend what was happening.

This also made Lan Shiyu’s face briefly change. When he focused his attention on them, he was shocked to discover wisps of an eerie aura coming from the crack on the riverbed.

It wasn’t significant, but it was strange because it could freeze Cang Mu and that skinny man. Not only did it freeze their muscles, but also their astral energy.

The frozen two could no longer pay attention to the sword. They were trying to execute various means to dissolve the eerie aura. But something weird occurred. They could sense that even their astral energy was frozen, instantly enveloping their hearts in fear.

“Young Master Lan, save me!” The two panicked, and their faces changed.

An Liuyan was also shocked because she never expected this. She then thought of how Lin Yun retreated with her, she instantly wondered if Lin Yun had previously discovered this.

“Damn it!” Lan Siyu cursed before he turned to Lin Yun, “You bastard, are you behind this?”

“I don’t know what you’re talking about.” Lin Yun shook his head.

“Young Master Lan, you must be joking. This is your fortune. So what has it got to do with us?” An Liuyan smiled.

That reply made Lan Siyu even more furious, and he coldly said, “You piece of trash, go and save them! Otherwise, the Netherworld Hall won’t let you off, and there won’t be a place for you in the Eastern Desolation!”

But Lin Yun didn’t say a word, acting as if he was in deep thought.

“As long as you can do as I say, I’ll give up on that saint sword!” Lan Siyu said with a cold light flashing through his pupils.

Right then, Lin Yun could sense several auras a few hundred miles away, but they were all hidden.

“You piece of trash, why aren’t you making a move! Are you not afraid of my Netherworld Hall?” Lan Siyu surged with killing intent as he unleashed his cultivation at the seven-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm. Simultaneously, the baleful aura surging in the center of his brow condensed into a blood-red mark.

This changed An Liuyan’s face because she was still afraid of the Netherworld Hall. After all, it wasn’t an understatement to call the Netherworld Hall the chief of the seven demonic sects.

“Alright.” Lin Yun soared into the sky, flying past the two, and waved his hand, summoning the Flower Burial Sword to his hand. When he grabbed onto the Flower Burial Sword, he turned around and swung his sword, instantly decapitating those two. Two seven-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm experts lost their lives just like that.

“You’re courting death!” Lan Siyu roared after being briefly stunned. But just when he was about to make a move, Lin Yun already charged over and swung his sword down.

When he unleashed his firmament sword intent, Lin Yun also circulated the two thousand saint aura strands in his violet palace.

Lan Siyu used his full strength and could barely withstand this attack. His pupils rapidly shrank as blood dripped from the corner of his mouth.

On the other hand, Lin Yun quickly swung out a total of seven swords, causing Lan Siyu to throw out a mouthful of blood before he was sent flying away.

“How is this possible?!” Lan Siyu exclaimed with shock as he laid on the ground.
