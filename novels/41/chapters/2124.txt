Chapter 2125: One Sword

Before Lin Yun could respond to the poisonous mist, it swept over him. It was as though Lin Yun’s body had an attraction force, sucking all the poisonous mist into his body. As the poisonous mist swiftly accumulated within his blood, it didn’t take long for Lin Yun’s blood to turn black, and the poison was swiftly penetrating Lin Yun’s internal organs through blood flow.

Everything happened in the blink of an eye, and Lin Yun had never heard of such a powerful poison before. His body was starting to get corroded, and he couldn’t stop this process even with his nirvana aura and Astral Sword Intent because the poison had merged with his body.

At the time, the marsh exploded as the hunter appeared, revealing its head. It gave off a dragon aura while coldly looking at Lin Yun. But it was cautious and didn’t make a move. It waited till Lin Yun’s lips turned black before unleashing its attack. The tongue that Lin Yun had severed earlier had regenerated and flew over like a lightning bolt.

But just when the tongue was about to reach Lin Yun, Lin Yun opened his eyes and grabbed onto the tongue before dragging the lizard over. The lizard was also decisive as it bit down on its tongue and landed down.

“Die!” Lin Yun didn’t want to waste time with the lizard. He tossed the lizard’s tongue with his right hand and flicked his finger, letting the Flower Burial Sword fly out.

With Astral Sword Intent empowering the Twospirit Glory Saint Artifact, the Flower Burial Sword easily pierced the lizard’s tough skin, severing it into two. As blood scattered across the marsh, the two bisected body parts of the lizard were wriggling as if they wanted to regenerate into two lizards.

“You’re starting to get on my nerves!” Lin Yun recalled the Flower Burial Sword, before pouring his nirvana aura into it. He then swung his sword. His attack decimated flesh of the lizard, reducing it to dust.

“That’s a Dragon Lizard, possessing a dragon clan bloodline. Its body can split into pieces, and its tongue contains powerful toxins. If you’re hit, it can control you like a puppet,” Lil’ Purple explained.

“It’s a little troublesome, not to mention it’s not a demonic beast at the Quasi-Saint Realm. If I didn’t transform my blood into dragon’s blood, I might have even had trouble dealing with the poison,” Lin Yun said. After being poisoned, he immediately circulated the Azure Dragon Divine Physique, and his dragon blood began to boil like magma, swiftly burning up the toxin.

“Let’s leave this place first.” Lin Yun didn’t want to stay here for long, but wanted to join up with Ye Ziling and the others. But it didn’t take long before he ran into trouble again. He ran into ten humanoids with snake heads and a horn growing from their foreheads, making them look sinister.

The ten snake humans screamed, releasing a powerful sound wave that struck Lin Yun’s soul. If it was someone else who ran into them, they would probably be in trouble. But Lin Yun’s sword intent was the bane of such mental attacks.

“Withered Tree Coming To Life!” Lin Yun swung his sword as the ancient tree behind him appeared. As his sword ray expanded, countless flower petals began to flutter before a sword ray flew out. Ten snake humans were all ripped apart before they could get close to Lin Yun.

“The demonic beasts within this secret realm all have an ancient origin and possess an ancient bloodline. They come in various shapes, and you’ll fall for it if you’re not careful.” Most importantly, the snake humans weren’t demonic beasts at the Quasi-Saint Realm. He knew that the trial in the secret realm wouldn’t be that easy, not to mention this was only the True Dragon Secret Realm.

Lin Yun analyzed that the demonic beasts within the secret realm came in various shapes and seemed to be ancient demonic beasts. He didn’t know how massive the marsh was, but Lin Yun walked for four hours; however, he couldn’t find his way out of this marsh.

Along the way, Lin Yun would run into various demonic beasts, similar to those from ancient times, possessing special abilities. They would either be proficient in poison, have an unusual vitality, or be proficient in sound waves.

Not too long ago, he slew a transparent horned demonic beast. It was hidden in the wind and could breathe lightning. Most importantly, Lin Yun’s sword aura couldn’t touch it. In the end, Lin Yun found the demonic beast with thunderstorm intent before crushing it with the Azure Dragon Grasp.

“This is?” Lin Yun found a bizarre herb a thousand meters away, emitting a faint radiance. In the marsh, such insignificant herbs like that should be cautious around because they were either real treasures or a trap that had a powerful demonic beast guarding it.

“Did I see it wrong?” Lin Yun noticed that the radiance coming from the herb had disappeared. He easily traveled across a thousand meters with a tap of his feet and appeared before the herb. When he reached out, the herb suddenly ‘crouched’ down. But before it could move, the herb didn’t seem to possess any spirituality, and yet Lin Yun failed to grab it.

“This is a really unusual herb.” Lin Yun’s eyes lit up because this meant that the herb possessed intelligence, knowing how to conceal itself like a demonic beast. As it swayed in the wind, it looked like a pitiful lady.

“Don’t move.” Lin Yun had no patience to play with the herb and sealed the entire space with his sword intent before grabbing it and tugging it out of the ground. As golden flames soared to the sky, the disguise that was on the herb was removed, revealing an herb enveloped in golden flames. It had already bore fruit and looked like a golden cauldron with a divine phoenix and heavenly dragon engraved on it.

“Oh my god…” Lin Yun was shocked because this was a ten thousand year-old Golden Cauldron Herb, containing pure dragon blood and even possessed innate saint runes. It began to struggle when Lin Yun grabbed onto it, revealing its real body, releasing the sound of greater dao as the cauldron vibrated. Lin Yun’s blood boiled, and his internal organs nearly exploded under the shockwave. If it was a Quasi-Saint who was here instead, he would definitely be killed by the shockwave.

“Holy shit, it’s an innate saint fruit! Lin Yun, your luck is really heaven-defying!” Lil’ Purple said enviously. “I dare say that the Divine Dragon Secret Realms might not even have?an innate saint fruit."

Lin Yun rejoiced upon hearing that. He was also lucky to discover this herb.

“Give up!” The herb was still struggling, trying its best to attack Lin Yun. But Lin Yun didn’t waste time with it and grabbed the herb with his left hand. Then, the Black Thunder Chains dug into the ground, cutting its roots. The herb’s roots were unbelievable because they spread over ten-odd miles or even over a hundred miles.

But it was futile because it ran into Lin Yun. Lin Yun first restricted it with his Astral Sword Intent before severing its roots with a Glory Saint Artifact. Lastly, he competed with it in brute strength, relying on his Azure Dragon Divine Physique. In the end, Lin Yun managed to pull the herb out of the ground.

The Golden Cauldron Herb was rare and precious, but the one before him was incredibly precious because it was ten thousand years old. Not to mention, it possessed innate saint runes, which manifested into a divine phoenix and heavenly dragon, looking similar to the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron.

“Innate saint fruit, this is really a treasure!” Lin Yun could clearly sense the boundless saint aura inside the cauldron. Aside from that, it even contained pure dragon blood. So it would achieve an unbelievable height regardless of using it to make a breakthrough or to cultivate his Azure Dragon Divine Physique. Lin Yun even suspected that it could help him reach the Quasi-Saint Realm.

“Lil’ Purple, do you think it can help me reach the Quasi-Saint Realm?” Lin Yun asked. He could sense the immense power contained within the innate saint fruit. Lin Yun naturally desired the Quasi-Saint Realm despite not looking like it. But he gave up after several attempts because he reached the tenth transformation of the Nirvana Stage.

“Yeah. You can’t make a breakthrough not because your foundation isn’t enough but because your bottleneck is too tough. The Golden Cauldron Fruit is perfect for making a breakthrough because of its domineering energies. You shouldn’t worry about your bottleneck at that time, but if your physique can withstand it,” Lil’ Purple analyzed. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Someone is here!” Lin Yun had just received the innate saint fruit, before several Quasi-Saints at the Indigo Origin Phase looked at Lin Yun.

“Brat, hand over the Golden Cauldron Herb!”

“Don’t force us to make a move!” There were six people who gathered around him, wanting to force Lin Yun to hand over the Golden Cauldron Herb. Some people didn’t even notice that Lin Yun obtained an innate saint fruit, not just the Golden Cauldron Herb.

“You guys are courting death!” Lin Yun didn’t waste time with them. These Quasi-Saints didn’t even grasp a greater dao and were no different from mere ants before him.

As Lin Yun swung his sword, those who got close to him were sent flying away. This scene scared everyone before Lin Yun swung his sword, killing another three Quasi-Saints. It didn’t take long for one Quasi-Saint to be left, who fled to where he came from.

Lin Yun didn’t pursue him but swung his sword, unleashing a sword ray that severed that Quasi-Saint into two. He didn’t hold back as he carried on, and a purple-clothed youth sat on a rock, looking at him with a smile.

This youth seemed extraordinary; his purple clothes were extraordinary saint armor. He looked confident as he allowed Lin Yun to walk in his direction. As he ate a fruit, he smiled, “As expected of Ye Qingtian. It's no wonder why you can be on the Divine Dragon Elite Ranking, killing six Quasi-Saints at the Indigo Origin Phase like nothing. But I’m not the same. I've grasped a greater dao half a year ago. I might not be on the Divine Dragon Elite Ranking, but you’ll lose terribly if you put me on the same level as those people. Everything beneath the greater dao is…”

But before the youth could finish, Lin Yun swung his sword and severed that person into two with his saint armor. That youth didn’t even know how he died nor how Lin Yun killed him from ten steps away. His saint aura was clearly amplified by greater dao, and he still had many trump cards left.
