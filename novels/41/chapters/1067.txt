Chapter 1068 - Bully

Safety wasn’t guaranteed in the final battle, so the elder’s words were a reminder to everyone. However, many people felt a dilemma because they benefited greatly from the Saint Spiritual Lake.

Although the benefits they received weren’t comparable to what the Realm Sons experienced, they still transformed. In just three days, they had grown one fold stronger as they still had a lot of spiritual energy that they needed to refine.

Then again, it would be a pity if they lost their lives on an impossible challenge because giving up was the same as giving up on the Kunlun Realm.

However, the elderly voice didn’t care about everyone’s thoughts and continued, “The rules for the final battle are simple. The Nine-Leaf Saint Fruit will reach maturity in an hour. The leaves take 9,000 years to bloom, and all of the accumulated flower fragrance from the past 9,000 years will condense into floral saint liquid. The ranking for the final battle will be decided by the amount of floral saint liquid…”

The rules were simple, so everyone understood what to do. Whoever collected the most floral saint liquid would be crowned the champion. Naturally, the competition would be intense to become the champion and to capture the attention of the elders. It would be a bloodbath once the fruit matured.

The commotion became softer as everyone began to hesitate. They could always obtain some floral saint liquid before giving up. Otherwise, they would be left with nothing. There was no doubt that the floral saint liquid was a lot more precious than the golden sparkles in the lake.

“Big Brother Luo, what should we do now?” Qin Lin, Jun Mengchen, and those from the Profound Amber Realm all turned to look at Luo Chen because he was their leader.

Luo Chen’s eyes began to flicker as he fell into deep thoughts. There was no question that his companions were tempted by the floral saint liquid, so they wanted to participate in the final battle. However, Luo Chen had a bad feeling.

“Let’s give up. The Nether Divinity Realm Son probably won’t let us go if we join the final battle,” said Luo Chen. He sensed a strong killing aura a few days ago that kept him guarded.

Qin Lin and the rest didn’t hesitate to give up because Luo Chen was their leader. When Luo Chen’s group gave up, everyone looked over in confusion. They couldn’t believe that Luo Chen’s group was heading for the shore.

“They’re going to give up? It makes no sense with their strength…”

“Luo Chen, Qin Lin, and Jun Mengchan all have the strength to reach the top twenty in purple ranking. Luo Chen can even make it into the top ten. Why are they giving up on the opportunity to join a powerful sect?”

“What can they do? Everyone knows about their relationship with Lin Yun. After all, they were the ones who helped Lin Yun buy the True Dragon Saint Liquid and Blood Flame Pellets in Four Phase City.”

“Weren’t they courting death when they decided to help Lin Yun back then?” Luo Chen’s group weren’t nameless figures, so their departure instantly attracted everyone’s attention. But it only took a moment for everyone to understand what was going on. With the Nether Divinity Realm Son’s temper, there was no way he would let Luo Chen’s group off that easily.

After all, there was no way the Nether Divinity Realm Son would let this matter rest easy as long as Lin Yun’s name was still on the golden ranking.

“We’re here!” The group let out a sigh the moment they reached the shore. But in the next second, a cold aura swept out and enveloped the entire region. Luo Chen’s face changed when he felt the aura.

A figure descended before Luo Chen’s group and said, “You want to leave? Aren’t you a little too naive to think that you can leave with me around?”

The Nether Divinity Realm Son’s face radiated with dark killing intent. He unleashed his pressure that made everyone aside from Luo Chen throw up a mouthful of blood. Luo Chen was barely able to resist the pressure and said, “Nether Divinity Realm Son, we gave up. Is there really any reason for you to take things this far?”

The Nether Divinity Realm Son’s eyes flashed with mockery as he sneered, “You don’t have to speak so loudly. Since you gave up, do you think the elders will pay any attention to you? Do you dare to admit that you helped Lin Yun back in Four Phase City?”

Hearing that, Luo Chen’s face changed and gritted his teeth, “I admit my actions, but I’m the only one responsible. Let them go.”

”Hahaha, great! I like straightforward people like you! Then get down on your knees!” The Nether Divinity Realm Son laughed before he suddenly made his move. Due to how strong he was, many people couldn’t see how he attacked, they could only feel the mountain of pressure from his hands.

As his palm descended down, Luo Chen threw up a mouthful of blood while his bones cracked and forced him to his knees. The Nether Divinity Realm Son's sudden slap left everyone shocked. However, the onslaught didn’t stop there. A black light rose up from the Nether Divinity Realm Son’s body as his hair fluttered in the wind violently.

“Big Brother Luo!” Qin Lin’s party became anxious.

The Nether Divinity Realm Son merely looked down at them with disdain, “The other leg. Do you want to do it yourself or do you want me to help you?”

Luo Chen’s face was nasty as he stopped Qin Lin and the others from helping. “I’m the only one responsible, so I’ll kneel!”

When he placed his other knee down, Qin Lin’s party looked at the Nether Divinity Realm Son with flames blazing in their pupils. Even the spectators were shaking their heads because Luo Chen’s situation was too miserable.

After all, most people would rather die than suffer this kind of humiliation. However, no one said a word because they couldn’t afford to provoke the Nether Divinity Realm Son. After all, the Nether Divinity Realm Son was now in the sixth soul Heavenly Soul Realm with ten Demonic Astral Flowers in his aura oceans.

“I shouldn’t have gone against you. Can you let us go now?” Luo Chen gave the Nether Divinity Realm Son what he wanted, but the Nether Divinity Realm Son wasn’t satisfied. Swinging his hand out, he slapped Luo Chen’s face.

“Since you know you’re in the wrong, it’s not too much for me to give you a slap, right?” The Nether Divinity Realm Son sneered at Luo Chen with ridicule. His words made Luo Chen spit up a mouthful of blood in anger. Luo Chen’s eyes became bloodshot as he clenched his fist tightly. He was on the verge of losing control of his anger.

Lin Yun had saved his life, so Luo Chen wouldn’t hesitate to repay Lin Yun with his life. But he still had his friends and Lin Yun’s friends from the Profound Amber Realm to worry about. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“No, it’s not much. Now, can you let my friends go?” Luo Chen said.

The moment Luo CHen was done speaking, the Nether Divinity Realm Son gave him another slap and chuckled, “So it turns out that you’re this cheap. Since you’re happy about my slap, I’ll give you another.”

The Nether Divinity Realm Son continued to give Luo Chen a series of slaps, leaving everyone dumbfounded. They all knew that the Nether Divinity Realm Son was venting out his hatred for Lin Yun on Luo Chen. It was shameless.

“You bastard!” Qin Lin and the rest instantly flew into a rage and charged towards the Nether Divinity Realm Son.

“Haha, you can’t blame me now, Luo Chen. How can I possibly accept a bunch of ants acting against me?” The Nether Divinity Realm Son’s eyes flashed with a vicious light before he laughed and suddenly moved.

The difference in strength was simply too huge. Qin Lin and the others were sent flying away with just an attack. Then, they fell into the Saint Spiritual Liquid.

“You fooled me!” Luo Chen immediately bounced up from his seat.

“Get lost!” The Nether Divinity Realm Son kicked Luo Chen’s ribs and caused them to crack. In the end, he too landed in the Saint Spiritual Liquid.

“You ants. Did you really think that I would let you off?” The Nether Divinity Realm Son’s face was cold as soared into the sky. Then, he walked towards the Saint Spiritual Lake. At this moment, everyone realized that the Nether Divinity Realm Son was playing around.

He never had any intentions of letting Lin Yun’s friends go. The Nether Divinity Realm Son was too vicious. He disregarded his identity and attacked those that were lower than him.

“No one can save you! This is the consequence for going against me!” The Nether Divinity Realm Son sped towards the Saint Spiritual Lake and looked at Luo Chen’s group indifferently.

“Hmph, you want to kill us? Killing us won’t change the fact that Lin Yun slapped you. You’re nothing but trash. You can’t even compare to one of Brother Lin’s fingers!” Qin Lin mocked.

“Lin Yun? He’s just a lowly bastard who I chased into the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm. He’s destined to die there. He’s the same as a dog!” The Nether Divinity Realm Son snorted at Qin Lin’s words.

“You’re really shameless.” Qin Lin sneered. “Those who don’t know the truth might actually believe you.”

“You’re courting death!” The Nether Divinity Realm Son’s eyes flashed with a cold light.

But just when he walked over to Qin Lin, Luo Chen stood up and said coldly, “You have to walk over my dead body if you want to touch him.”

“You piece of trash. It looks like my slaps weren’t enough. I guess I have to fulfill your wish!” The Nether Divinity Realm Son glared at Luo Chen with anger in his eyes.

Suddenly, a crimson light streaked across the sky. Then, a youth carrying a sword box descended from the sky.
