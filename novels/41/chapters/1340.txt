Chapter 1341 - Ghost?

Lei Jue’s roar dispersed Gongsun Yan’s sword aura and made him throw out a mouthful of blood. At that moment, Gongsun Yan realized that there was a huge gap between them. Fear began to appear in his eyes as his face turned pale.

If it was normal, he would’ve fallen on his knees by now. Anyhow, this wasn’t the first time he begged for his life ever since he came to the Profound Wither Island. But when he looked at the Sword Emperor’s portrait that was floating nearby, his face suddenly changed.

No matter what, he couldn’t allow himself to beg for mercy before the Sword Emperor’s portrait. The Sword Emperor was someone he respected the most and held a great position in his heart. As a decisive light flashed through his pupils, Gongsun Yan gritted his teeth, “Lei Jue, don’t push it! If I’m willing, the two of them won’t be alive to see you!”

“Interesting. I never expected that a coward like you would have such a courageous side,” said Lei Jue indifferently.

“Let me go and I’ll owe you one in the future!” Gongsun Yan said with hope blazing in his pupils.

“Who the hell do you think you are? Do you really think you’re someone? Others might not know, but I know your origin well. You call yourself someone from the Sword Emperor’s lineage? Haha…” Lei Jue sneered and mocked, “Your father is a Sword-Bearing Elder of the Skysolute City, but your mother is a demoness from the Demon Domain. You’re just an illegitimate child. More blatantly, you’re just a bastard!”

“You!” Gongsun Yan’s eyes turned red because his birth had always been a pain in his heart.

“What’s the matter? Did I say anything wrong?” Lei Jue smiled. “Not to mention that this isn’t your first time begging for mercy. You’ve done it a lot of times in the Ancient Barren Domain. Let me think… is it because the Sword Emperor’s portrait is here that you don’t have the face to beg for mercy?”

When Lei Jue saw Gongsun Yan’s face change, he smiled. “Interesting. A useless fool like you actually has a day where you will want your face. Then, let me help you!”

Without any hesitation, Lei Jue reached out and pushed his palm towards the Sword Emperor’s portrait. He had lightning circulating on his palm, and this made Gongsun Yan’s face change. He quickly stowed the Sword Emperor’s portrait and took the palm head-on, making him throw out a mouthful of blood and fell onto one knee.

“Hmph, a fake like you wants to protect the dignity of the Sword Emperor? You’re courting death!” Lei Jue was furious. Gongsun Yan was nothing but a joke in his eyes, but Gongsun Yan actually dared to go against his orders?

But just when Lei Jue wanted to summon his constellation, something bizarre took place. An invincible pressure appeared in the surroundings. Under the pressure, Lei Jue couldn’t summon his constellation and this made his face change. “Hmph, I can still kill you even without summoning my constellation!”

Soaring to the sky, lightning began to gather on Lei Jue’s palm. It then pressed down towards Gongsun Yan like a huge sun. He had refined an origin saint rune to reach the Elysium Core Realm. So even if he didn’t summon his constellation, he could still easily kill Gongsun Yan with a palm.

When Gongsun Yan turned around and saw this scene, his face instantly turned pale. But right at that moment, a voice resounded within Gongsun Yan’s mind and he pushed out his palm, “Don’t panic. Attack him.”

Something bizarre took place. When his palm collided with Lei Jue’s palm, Lei Jue threw out a mouthful of blood and was sent flying back. He couldn’t resist Gongsun Yan’s palm at all, and this scene had directly left Gongsun Yan and Lei Jue both dumbfounded.

“Senior brother!” The faces of the two Profound Sky Sect’s disciples changed and wanted to step up to help Lei Jue.

“Get lost!” Lei Jue shoved them aside and flew into a rage before he pushed his palm out once more.

When Gongsun Yan recovered from his shock, he was terrified to the point that he retreated in a panic. As he staggered backward, he barely managed to unleash his attack. This time, it was even more extraordinary. Lei Jue was sent flying before he crashed into the wall.

“What the hell?” Gongsun Yan was shocked. When Lei Jue got back on his feet, Gongsun Yan pushed his palm out once more and made Lei Jue throw out a mouthful of blood. This instantly made Lei Jue’s face change and he fell to his knees.

This made Gongsun Yan shocked before he laughed, “Lei Jue, weren’t you arrogant just a moment ago? Why are you not continuing your arrogance? Now, kneel!”

Pushing out his palm once more, Lei Jue who got back on his feet, fell onto his knees once more. This time, Lei Jue was completely stumped, and he had no idea what was going on.

“Haha! I can suppress fated transcendents now!” Gongsun Yan rejoiced. Although he had no idea what was going on, it was a fact that Lei Jue kneeled to him.

“Quick, leave!” Lei Jue looked around and no longer dared to stay here for another second.

“Hey, don’t leave! I’ll cripple you!” Gongsun Yan became even more arrogant as he laughed and was about to give chase. But just when he took a step forth, he staggered and powerlessly fell to the ground. As he contemplated what was going on, the scroll flew out.

Looking at the scroll, Gongsun Yan suddenly recalled the voice that echoed within his mind and came up with a terrifying speculation. Suddenly, the scroll blazed and a person slowly walked out of it. When that person walked out from the painting entirely, the painting had already disappeared.

When Gongsun Yan raised his head and looked at the figure before him, he was so terrified that he didn’t dare to utter a single word.

The Sword Emperor, Yu Qingfeng, walked out of a painting? Just what the hell is going on? Is this an illusion? Gongsun Yan rubbed his eyes and noticed that the other party really came out of the painting and was looking at him with a playful smile.

“Gongsun Yan, I heard that you pretend to be a disciple of the Skysolute City to bluff others?” Yu Qingfeng smiled.

When Gongsun Yan heard that, he could hear thunder rumbling in his mind and fell onto his knees, “S-S-Senior…”

At the same time, Lei Jue was fleeing with the two other disciples, and their faces were ugly. He couldn’t believe that he actually knelt to a nameless person, and he couldn’t figure out when Gongsun Yan became so strong.

“Get lost!” Lei Jue was charging forth and didn’t want to stay there for another second. Whenever there was someone standing before him, he would attack without any hesitation, injuring the other party heavily.

But a person who was swaying from left to right suddenly appeared before him. Looking at that person made Lei Jue even more annoyed, so he pushed his palm out without any hesitation, “Get lost!”

But that person responded with a sword ray. Before Lei Jue could fully unleash his attack, a sword ray had already come before him. This made Lei Jue startled and quickly retreated as the sword ray brushed past his neck.

Feeling the stinging pain coming from his neck, Lei Jue recovered from his shock and could feel a chill down his spine. If that sword was a little faster, then his head would be rolling on the ground by now. Although he was heavily injured in his confrontation with Gongsun Yan, he was still a fated transcendent and not just anyone could injure him.

He began to wonder what the hell this palace was and how come there were so many geniuses. When he raised his head and looked at the person who was swaying from left to right, he exclaimed, “Zhao Yan!”

The Sword Maniac, Zhao Yan, had an insignificant rank on the Empyrean Ranking, but he was from a Saint Clan. This meant that his clan had a Saint, so Lei Jue naturally recognized Zhao Yan and even had some impression about him.

“Lil’ Lei.” Zhao Yan said, looking at Lei Jue.

When Lei Jue heard that, the corner of his lip twitched. Just who did Zhao Yan think he was? Was ‘Lil’ Lei’ something anyone could call him by? But since he was in a rush to leave this place, he couldn’t be bothered about it and coldly said, “Open your eyes clearly next time. Otherwise, I would’ve killed you if I didn’t know who you were.”

“Oh.” Zhao Yan nodded.

“Hmph!” Lei Jue coldly snorted before he continued to flee from this mountain.

“Not fast enough…” Zhao Yan muttered to himself with his brows locked together. As he gradually returned to his dazed state, it didn’t take long for him to come to the chamber Gongsun Yan was in. When he saw Gongsun Yan on his knees, he wasn’t surprised by it and asked, “Gongsun Yan, who are you talking to? Lei Jue is already gone, so there’s no need for you to remain kneeling on the ground.”

The sudden voice made Gongsun Yan rejoice before his smile froze on his face.

Zhao Yan can’t see the Sword Emperor? When Gongsun Yan turned his head in Zhao Yan’s direction, he noticed that Zhao Yan had no reaction to the Sword Emperor standing before him.

Just then, the Sword Emperor was looking at him with a playful smile. Gongsun Yan could only feel his scalps going numb and got back on his feet before he asked Zhao Yan, “You can’t see anything?”

Is there someone here? Zhao Yan fell into deep thoughts before he unleashed a sword ray in the direction that Gongsun Yan pointed out. His sword ray was aimed at the center of Sword Emperor’s brow, and this nearly made Gongsun Yan’s heart fly out of his chest. But Zhao Yan’s sword ray passed through the center of the Sword Emperor’s brow.

“You have a serious problem.” Zhao Yan muttered before he sheathed his sword.

“He can’t see me.” Yu Qingfeng’s voice resounded within Gongsun Yan’s mind, which nearly made Gongsun Yan scream out.

But after Gongsun Yan calmed down, he asked, “S-S-Senior…you’re really the Sword Emperor?”

“As real as it gets,” smiled Yu Qingfeng.

“Then can you take me as your disciple? You misunderstood me. I might not be from your lineage, but I have your dignity!” Gongsun Yan asked emotionally, feeling that he had become lucky. If the Sword Emperor really took him as a disciple, then he would practically be soaring to the sky.

“You? Nah. Him, maybe.” Yu Qingfeng smiled, pointing at Zhao Yan. He didn’t mock Gongsun Yan, who claimed to possess the dignity of the Sword Emperor..

This scene made the corner of Gongsun Yan’s lip twitch. He made up his mind to get rid of Zhao Yan.

“Don’t reveal my existence. Come with me for a bit.”

“To where?”

“The Great Saint Origin,” replied Yu Qingfeng.

Hearing that, Gongsun Yan became emotional. But then he suddenly thought of something. He quickly asked, “Senior, don’t tell me that you’re the one who launched a sneak attack on the Profound Wither Great Saint, right?”

“Weren’t you pretty smart earlier? You have already figured out the answer, so why are you asking me?” Yu Qingfeng smiled.

But if it wasn’t the Sword Emperor, then why was he going to look for the Great Saint Origin? Gongsun Yan could feel his head swelling at this moment because what happened today was too unbelievable.

“Get him to follow you,” Yu Qingfeng said before he left, dispelling Gongsun Yan’s thoughts about shaking off Zhao Yan.
