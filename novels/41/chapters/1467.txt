Chapter 1468 - Young People Shouldn't Be Too Arrogant

Everything happened too quickly. Everyone was still immersed in the shock of Lin Yun resolving the sword ray, then the ninth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flower was already going to appear, catching everyone by surprise. Some people hadn’t come back to their senses after Lin Yun defeated Huangfu Yan’s group of four.

Without the fog enveloping the core region, everyone’s eyes were focused on Lin Yun. As cracks appeared at the lake's center, a golden aura and an enchanting aroma seeped from the cracks. Just by taking in a breath alone, everyone could feel their blood boiling.

“What power!”

“Looks like the value of this ninth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flower isn’t any lower than a tenth-grade Spiritual Sword Bead.”

“It might be even stronger. After all, this is nourished by Yu Qingfeng’s sword intent. Who could be compared to the Sword Emperor of the current Divine Dragon Era?”

“I wonder who will obtain it.” Exclamations resounded from the surroundings. Even before it appeared, the ninth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flower had already left a deep impression on everyone. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

The three figures were swiftly making their way to the center of the lake. But they were surprised by an invisible wall of sword intent that was standing in their way like a barrier. Regardless of Jin Xuanyi or Ji Shuxuan, they descended from the sky. Lin Yun, who rushed over, stopped almost immediately.

Ji Shuxuan and Jin Xuanyi first looked at the lake's center before turning towards Lin Yun. They didn’t expect Lin Yun to really make it over, and it was even more surprising that he defeated Huangfu Yan’s group of four.

They initially didn’t put Lin Yun in their eyes because they were no longer suitable to stay on the Earth Ranking with their strength. After all, even deacons at the first pulse of the Dragon Pulse Realm were no longer their opponents. Their strength had long surpassed everyone on the Earth Ranking.

There was an insurmountable gulf between them and Wang Cheng, and that gulf wasn’t something that could be seen just from the ranking. They initially thought that Lin Yun was lucky to defeat Huangfu Yan. But they didn’t imagine four geniuses on the Earth Ranking couldn’t stop him, which made them feel slightly pressured.

“Divine Firmament Peak’s Lin Yun pays his greetings to two senior brothers.” Lin Yun smiled as he cupped his hands. His politeness caught Jin Xuanyi and Ji Shuxuan by surprise.

As a light flashed in Ji Shuxuan’s pupils, he stood with his hands behind him, looking at Lin Yun with a meaningful gaze, “Your temper seems to be different from the rumors.”

Jin Xuanyi didn’t say a word, but his gaze was also fixed on Lin Yun.

“I’m known for having a good temper. So the rumors naturally can’t be taken seriously. Just like the rumors say that the two of you are targeting me, I didn’t believe that.” Lin Yun held onto his chin and smiled with his eyes squinted.

But his words changed Jin Xuanyi and Ji Shuxuan’s faces and became strange. They awkwardly smiled, with the corner of their lips twitching. Only they knew that the rumors were true, including Huangfu Yan’s group of four joining hands and wanting to teach Lin Yun a lesson.

They wanted to embarrass Lin Yun before the sect master and ensure that Lin Yun wouldn’t disrupt their competition for the ninth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flower. Not only them, but everyone in the Sword Sect knew that the rumor was true. But Lin Yun had disapproved of the rumors before them in front of everyone.

Jin Xuanyi suddenly said, “Junior Brother Lin, let’s not beat around the bush. The rumors are true, and the two of us did plan to teach you a lesson. You should know why. But even the third on the Earth Ranking was defeated by you, and this means that our plans were nothing but a joke.”

Jin Xuanyi’s frankness surprised everyone, and even Ji Shuxuan couldn’t help looking at him. But Lin Yun smiled and didn’t say a word, waiting for Jin Xuanyi to continue. Jin Xuanyi briefly paused before he looked at Lin Yun, and said, “You have already proven yourself, and you’re worthy of being a heaven direct disciple. But do you still want to continue fighting?”

The smile on his face gradually subsided, and he continued without waiting for Lin Yun to continue, “You’re a smart person. So you should know your limits. You’ve already gotten enough, and even the third on the Earth Ranking is nothing but a joke before you. But if you continue, it’ll be terrible to become the joke yourself.”

The golden aura and floral fragrance grew denser as the cracks spread over the lake. Many disciples had given up on competing for the Azure Lotus Sword Flowers and sat down to refine the golden aura.

As for the center of the lake, Lin Yun, Ji Shuxuan, and Jin Xuanyi were facing off and the atmosphere around them suddenly became tense.

“Are you threatening me?” Lin Yun asked.

“I’m just giving you a warning out of goodwill. But I don’t mind if you think of it as a threat.” Jin Xuanyi replied without any change on his face. He was arrogant, and his words were equivalent to disregarding Lin Yun. But as someone at the five-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm, reaching the fifth stage in the Golden Firmament Sword Sutra and even defeating a deacon, he was worthy of being arrogant.

“Brother Ji should share the same thoughts as me,” said Jin Xuanyi as he turned to look at Ji Shuxuan.

Ji Shuxuan was surprised when he heard that because he didn’t think that Jin Xuanyi would drag him along. But he ultimately sighed and smiled, “Junior Brother Lin, you’re still not worthy of competing for the ninth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flower. This is a battle between Jin Xuanyi and me, and this will also be our last fight on the Earth Ranking. So we don’t wish to be disturbed.”

“What a coincidence because I happen to share the same thoughts. Since I’m here, I also don’t think you guys are worthy of competing for the ninth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flower. Oh, I meant the both of you, not just one of you.”

The moment Lin Yun said that, two terrifying chills descended upon Lin Yun. Ji Shixuan looked at Jin Xuanyi and asked, “Would you like to have the honor, or shall I do it?”

“Let me do it. It’s not like I have to reveal that many of my trump cards. You can just guard the ninth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flower.” Jin Xuanyi replied. The two fought many times. So they knew each other’s character well, and he wasn’t worried that Ji Shuxuan would take the opportunity to retrieve the ninth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flower.

In the next second, a terrifying wave of astral energy exploded from Jin Xuanyi and wrapped him in a golden light. The golden radiance gathered and formed into dazzling flames in the blink of an eye. More accurately, it looked like molten iron. But since it was too dazzling, it looked like a ball of fire from afar.

The aura coming from Jin Xuanyi was oppressive, causing the sword intent in the surroundings to tremble. This scene changed the faces of many Sword Sect’s disciples on the lake because this could only be achieved by reaching the fifth stage of the Golden Firmament Sword Sutra and undergoing a qualitative transformation.

Their faces became grave when they recalled the rumors that Jin Xuanyi could defeat Dragon Pulse Realm deacons.

“Sorry about this, Junior Brother Lin!” Jin Xuanyi said indifferently. He didn’t think that it would be a fair fight for Lin Yun. But he couldn’t be blamed since Lin Yun insisted on competing for the ninth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flower.

“This fellow…” Lin Yun squinted his eyes. He could feel pressured by Jin Xuanyi, which meant he couldn’t underestimate his opponent. Simultaneously, this also meant that the rumors might be true. However, Lin Yun was curious about how Jin Xuanyi’s Golden Firmament Sword Sutra in the fifth stage would be fair against his two sword sutras.

The Sword Sect is really interesting. Lin Yun wore a smile. As the Twelve-Petaled Netherflower bloomed in his violet palace, nether energy began to surge in his pupils.

“Senior Brother Jin, you don’t have to be so polite. You can just make your move. We’re all destined to compete in this world. As a swordsman, you can just come at me with your full strength.” When Lin Yun said those words, everyone could feel a majestic fighting spirit from Lin Yun that was blazing like raging flames, showing no fear.

When two terrifying waves of aura exploded from Lin Yun and Jin Xuanyi, everyone’s gazes were fixed on them as they held their breaths. They could predict that it would be an earth-shattering battle once they started to fight.

Then again, no one had expected that Lin Yun would be able to suppress four geniuses on the Earth ranking. This also made everyone acknowledge that Lin Yun had the strength befitting his status as a heaven direct disciple.

Although most people didn’t think he could defeat Jin Xuanyi, they also didn’t think Lin Yun would lose terribly. After all, Lin Yun could fight those whose cultivation was higher than him regardless of his firmament sword intent or Divine Firmament Sword Sutra that was at the pinnacle of the third stage.

The difference in realms wasn’t an insurmountable gulf for him, even if the gulf was a little too unbelievable this time with a difference of three stars. The real trouble was the difference in their sword sutras, one at the pinnacle of the fifth stage while the other was at the third stage, including Lin Yun’s lack of a ghost spirit martial technique. This was also why everyone felt that Lin Yun would lose this fight.

While the atmosphere was frozen around the lake, a sudden breeze blew like a stone falling into a calm lake, causing ripples to spread. When the breeze blew past, a cold light flashed through Lin Yun and Jin Xuanyi’s pupils.

The next moment, the two of them disappeared as their boundless astral energies turned into two monstrous torrents that looked like two ferocious roaring beasts that clashed together.

Along with a rumbling explosion, a terrifying shockwave swept out that caused considerable waves to rise on the lake. Every wave was at least three thousand meters high, but froze under Lin Yun and Jin Xuanyi’s auras.

Only the cracks at the lake's heart continued to spread along with the birth of the ninth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flower. Lin Yun and Jin Xuanyi didn’t use many techniques in their clash and only used their cultivation level and sword sutras. Regardless of whether it was Lin Yun or Jin Xuanyi, they were both confident in their cultivation techniques and cultivation level.

Everyone could tell that Jin Xuanyi held the advantage in this fight, and his cultivation level was much higher than Lin Yun's.

“Lin Yun is a madman to compete with Jin Xuanyi in cultivation level. Isn’t he too impulsive?”

“His attainment in Sword Dao should be greater than Jin Xuanyi. So shouldn’t he compete in sword techniques? Why is he using his weakness to fight Jin Xuanyi’s strengths?”

“It’s hard to say. Lin Yun doesn’t know any ghost spirit martial techniques. It might be enough for him to deal with others, but he would only lose terribly if he competes with Jin Xuanyi in sword techniques.” There were a lot of discussions going on since they had no idea what Lin Yun was doing.

“Is this all you’ve got? I’ve yet to warm up!” Jin Xuanyi was wrapped in golden light as he circulated his Golden Firmament Sword Sutra. He suddenly gave off a majestic aura as he looked down at Lin Yun. At this instance, he was like a monarch as his aura continued to rise before he slammed his palm down.

Under this immense aura, Lin Yun was restricted as the terrifying golden palm descended upon him. But that wasn’t all, a cold light flashed through Jin Xuanyi’s pupils before his palm turned into a claw. His five fingers were like swords emitting terrifying sword rays that could even cut through space.

Visible cracks intertwined in the surroundings, and Lin Yun's region seemed to have been overtaken. This made everyone feel a chill down their spines because Jin Xuanyi really brought his Golden Firmament Sword Sutra to a terrifying height.

Jin Xuanyi’s gaze was indifferent. Since he had decided to make a move against Lin Yun, he naturally had no intentions of going easy. He had already advised Lin Yun to leave, but since Lin Yun was so arrogant, he couldn’t be blamed for being ruthless.

Young people shouldn’t be too arrogant. Suffering a little setback wasn’t exactly bad.
