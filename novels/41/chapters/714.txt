Chapter 715 - Heading Up

The Demonification Fruit contained dense astral energy that emitted a pressure akin to a mountain.

“Why is it so heavy?” Lin Yun could sense an immense weight in his hand. Even with the powerful Azure Dragon Battle Physique, he was having difficulty carrying the fruit. When a surge of dense astral energy entered his body through his palm, the origin energy within his body became excited. Even the Iris Flower in his violet palace was trembling.

Lin Yun rejoiced as he stored the Demonification Fruit. He wanted to harvest more fruits. If six strands were this extraordinary, he couldn’t imagine how terrifying fruits with seven, eight, and nine strands would be.

As for Qin Xu, Jin Zhan, and Jin Yi, they definitely wouldn’t let him do as he wished. The three failed to obtain the Demonification Fruit, so they would thoroughly embarrass themselves if they allowed Lin Yun to leave.

As Guo Xu and Yang Fan, who had just climbed the tree, watched Lin Yun, they couldn’t help being shocked. This was just the beginning, but Lin Yun had already faced the seven geniuses head-on. Did he really not place the seven geniuses in his eyes?

“He’s a little too reckless. After all, this is their territory…” Guo Xu muttered. Lin Yun didn’t just have to worry about the seven geniuses, but also Skymound City’s geniuses. None of the other wandering cultivators dared to confront them, since they would ultimately have to leave this secret realm. If they left the secret realm, they would have to face the various forces and cultivators on the outside.

“Where do you think you’re going?!” The Jin brothers fumed and Jin Zhan charged over with a terrifying demonic hound following him. The hound was his martial soul and it was shrouded in eight profound lights. The lights signified that his martial soul, the Flame Demonic Hound, was an eighth profound grade martial soul.

When he stretched his hand out, the flames on his armor gathered on the demonic hound that was releasing a ferocious roar. Under the torrential flames, the demonic hound emitted a terrifying aura that could easily kill a cultivator in the greater Yin-Yang stage.

Lin Yun was surprised that Jin Zhan would summon his martial soul. This fellow was completely insane, trying to use all sorts of means to kill him.

Seven Slaughtering Seal!

Facing Jin Zhan’s martial soul, Lin Yun didn’t dare to be careless as he started to form seals with a single hand. When the seal was formed, a torrential killing aura swept out of him, covering a thousand meters. When the demonic hound entered the region of the killing aura, its movements suddenly became stiff.

Flicking Divine Finger—Graceful Moment, Absolute Hit!

Lin Yun started flicking his finger and shot dozens of sword rays into the Flame Demonic Hound in the blink of an eye.

“Demonic Ape Transformation!” Guo Xu also charged over as his muscles began to swell up. His violent aura clashed with Lin Yun’s killing aura. When he got close, he unleashed a barrage of punches at Lin Yun.

“Great timing!” Lin Yun barked as he charged over.

Omnipresent Anger, Raging Sky, Defiant Frustration, and Resonance!

In the blink of an eye, Lin Yun threw his punches while executing four forms of the Seven Slaughtering Fist. When he threw his punches, his killing aura, rage, and resentment poured out. When Lin Yun and Guo Xu collided, cracks began to spread on the ground beneath them.

These two were immersed in their fight and executed their martial techniques. The commotion from their fight even caused the towering tree to start shaking. After another clash, Lin Yun and Guo Xu both retreated a thousand meters with blood dripping from their lips.

But before Lin Yun could catch his breath, Jin Yi had charged over and started forming seals with both his hands. In the next second, his Thorn Flowers burned with golden flames and drifted down from the sky like snow. Combined with the Demonification Tree’s immense pressure, the entire region felt suffocating.

“Shameless sword slave, you have no idea how powerful I am!” Jin Zhan snorted as he also started to form seals while he walked towards Lin Yun.

“Hand over the Demonification Fruit and Divine Indigo Radiantstone. We’ll spare your life if you do!” Jin Zhan and Guo Xu also walked over after a brief rest, sealing off Lin Yun’s paths of retreat.

But in that critical moment, not only did Lin Yun not retreat, he even started to circulate the Iris Sword Sutra. He emitted a boundless sword intent that manifested into petals and allowed his origin energy to fill each corner of his body.

Thousands of sword rays began to radiate from the surface of Lin Yun’s body that caused a violent gale to blow. Looking at the Thorn Flowers that filled the sky, Lin Yun started walking forward. With each step, his aura began to surge even more. When he took the third step, he pushed his palm out, “Great Wind Scripture!”

Lin Yun roared as he poured all his energy into his palm. Jin Yi suddenly lost control of the Thorn Flowers that filled the sky. They formed a flaming tornado and slammed into Jin Zhan.

“I don’t need you people to order me around!” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly as he soared into the sky and struck Jin Yi’s chest. His palm broke Jin Yi’s ribs, causing the latter’s chest to cave in by half an inch.

Taking the palm head-on, Jin Yi coughed up blood and turned white. Simultaneously, Jin Zhan and Qin Xu’s attacks landed on Lin Yun’s body. But when their attacks landed on Lin Yun’s body, they were sent flying instead.

“What a powerful physique!” Both Jin Zhan and Qin Xu were shocked.

Lin Yun suddenly turned around with his hair fluttering in the wind and traces of blood leaking from his lips. The killing aura coming from him had shocked everyone. Even more scary was the fact that he was willingly hit by Jin Zhan and Qin Xu’s attacks just to teach Jin Yi a lesson.

Lying on the ground, Jin Yi struggled to get back up. He kept coughing up blood, unable to settle down.

“Big brother!” Looking at Jin Yi’s state, Jin Zhan’s face changed. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Come if you guys dare,” said Lin Yun before he soared into the sky and headed to a higher segment.

Looking at Lin Yun, the three were shocked. Lin Yun wasn’t satisfied with the Demonification Fruit he got and dared to go where Chen Ziyu and Chu Muyan were at? Not only did they fail to obtain the Demonification Fruit, but they even failed to make Lin Yun stay behind.

Right at this moment, they suddenly recalled what Lin Yun said to Chen Ziyu.

No one knew how high the towering tree was and people started to guess there must be a Demonification Fruit with nine strands of crimson aura above the crimson clouds. If they wanted the most precious Demonification Fruit, then they would have to make it through the crimson cloud.

But no one knew how long this tree had existed or how dangerous it was. As for those higher than the sixth segment, they were ignited into flames before they could even get close. There were also those who were devoured by the Demonification Fruits before they could even get close.

Without strength, it was practically impossible for anyone to get close to the fruits. Lin Yun obtained the Demonification Fruit because he wanted to make a breakthrough and was also seeking an opportunity to stand before Su Ziyao. No matter how high she stood, he wanted to stand next to her, even if it meant offending everyone around him.

Lastly, he also wanted to get some fruit for Lil’ Red. He owed Lil’ Red too much for saving his life. After all, that fool had risked its life countless times to cure his injuries in the past. So he had no choice but to compete!

“I have to kill this sword slave! After him!” Jin Yi wore a sinister expression as he endured the pain coming from his chest. Jin Zhan, Jin Yi, and Guo Xu’s faces were ugly as they watched Lin Yun leave. Then, they soared into the sky and chased after him.
