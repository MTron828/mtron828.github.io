Chapter 972 - Divine Golden Crow Pupils

Shi Xuan appeared out of nowhere and shocked everyone. Naturally, everyone felt unhappy that Shi Xuan was taking advantage of their hard work.

“Stop him!” Three people soared into the sky to stop Shi Xuan. All of them were in the fourth soul Heavenly Soul Realm, so they weren’t weak by any means. In fact, they were at the level of Liu Mu.

“You clowns dare to act with such impudence? You must be courting death!” Shi Xuan sneered as his clothes fluttered violently in the wind. His aura turned into a winged lion with ‘王’ on its forehead.

The kingly aura of the lion instantly restricted the cultivators who were standing in front of Shi Xuan. Their blood and origin energy froze as they floated helplessly in the air.

“Move!” Shi Xuan pushed his palm out, sending the three cultivators flying.

After sending those three flying away, Shi Xuan charged into the crowd and tore apart all the people who couldn’t get out of the way. “Die!” Screams filled the air as Shi Xuan descended like a demon. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Even Lin Yun’s eyes flickered, but he wasn’t in a hurry to make a move. Aside from Shi Xuan, he could sense other dangerous auras that probably belonged to Shi XUan’s companions.

Looking at the Divine Firebird, Shi Xuan snorted as he unleashed his saber intent. The Divine Firebird was instantly killed as Shi Xuan reached out and grabbed the beast core brimming with astral energy.

From his saber intent, it was clear that he must have refined a third soul Heavenly Soul Realm monarch beast core. Otherwise, his cultivation technique wouldn’t be able to allow him to unleash such a terrifying aura. As for the Divine Firebird’s beast core, it seemed to be a lot stronger than the Divine Core Lin Yun obtained from Baili Qi’s remains.

Then again, it made sense because Baili Qi only reached the Divine Core Realm right before he died. The Divine Firebird was so old that it must’ve reached the pinnacle Divine Core Realm at its peak, not to mention that it still possessed the bloodline of Golden Crow. Naturally, its beast core was stronger than Baili Qi’s.

“Shi Xuan!” Everyone had a nasty expression when Shi Xuan took the beast core. However, there was still the corpse, blood essence, and plume.

But before anyone could make a move, a black figure dashed over. He took a black lump of blood with a golden thread that represented the bloodline of the Golden Crow.

“Song Rui!” The crowd yelled at the black-clothed youth because he was the Gloryearth Spirit’s owner, Song Rui. Since there were two owners of the astral spirits present, the crowd had no chance of retaliating.

After putting away the beast core, Shi Xuan glanced at the blazing plume. To be exact, there were three feathers that had naturally formed runes and contained powerful dao rhyme. They would be extremely useful when it came to refining artifacts and comprehending the dao of the Golden Crow.

But just when he was about to take the plume, a figure appeared and seized all three feathers. Shi Xuan was briefly dumbfounded before he roared. However, when he looked at the person who snatched the plume, he was surprised, “Lin Yun? You didn’t die?!”

He clearly remembered that Lin Yun had to face dozens of Demonic Astral Flowers, and that every single flower was fatal. So he was shocked that Lin Yun was unscathed and holding the feathers.

“I’m not dead yet, thanks to you,” said Lin Yun coldly with his eyes squinted. He didn’t bother hiding his killing intent.

“Brother Lin, you really know how to joke.” Shi Xuan quickly calmed down and smiled, “I can give you the plume. Are you interested in joining hands with us to take all the inheritances?”

Give me? How shameless is this guy? Lin Yun was angry because even the Divine Firebird’s beast core should be his.

“Sorry, but I don’t have any interest in cooperating with you.” The Glorysun Constellation Palace had just opened, and Lin Yun wasn’t in a hurry to deal with Shi Xuan. So he left the moment he was done speaking. His attitude left all the spectators shocked because they realized that Lin Yun was as arrogant as the rumors said.

“Brat, don’t push it!” yelled Song Rui at Lin Yun’s back. “Brother Shi, you’re not afraid of him just because he killed a piece of trash like Liu Mu, right? There’s no place for him to be arrogant here with us together. Not to mention the Divine Firebird’s plume, we can even make him spit out all of his treasures.”

With a profound smile, Shi Xuan replied, “There's something weird about that brat. I still can’t figure out how he managed to survive. Leave him be. We can deal with him after we obtain the treasures here.”

After speaking, they stepped into the palace. The palace was massive and there were many treasures, so everyone had a chance at obtaining something precious. In the worst case scenario, they would obtain a fortune martial technique or dao artifact.

The inheritances in the Azure Dragon Seven Constellations were a lot stronger than the regular astral palaces. Clearly, Shi Xuan and Song Rui weren’t interested in those treasures. Even ordinary advanced fortune martial techniques couldn’t even catch their attention. What they wanted were saint grade treasures like saint pellets, monarch fortune martial techniques, transcendent dao artifacts, or other rare treasures.

“Don’t tell me that this palace doesn’t even have a saint pellet.” Song Rui and Shi Xuan were both disappointed after breaking the restriction of a random chamber.

“Relax,” said Shi Xuan calmly. “The guardian demonic beast was a Divine Firebird. How can this palace have nothing? Let’s just go to the main hall.”

“You read my mind.” Shi Xuan and Song Rui began charging towards the main hall, ignoring all the chambers along the way. When they reached the main hall, they were surprised to find it completely empty. Aside from some ancient patterns on the wall, they couldn’t find anything. It was as if someone had already ransacked the palace.

“What’s going on?” Shi Xuan and Song Rui couldn’t understand what was going on. When they looked around, they noticed that Lin Yun was also confused.

“He didn’t take everything, right? There’s no way he could pretend like he didn’t…” said Song Rui.

Shi Xuan’s eyes flickered because he also had similar thoughts. But after a brief moment, he replied, “He shouldn’t be pretending. If he already took everything, he would be leaving right now. Let’s spread out and search. There must be something here!”

They were right about Lin Yun. When Lin Yun entered the palace, he sped straight for the main hall. However, he failed to find anything and was certain that there was something weird about the main hall.

At this moment, he was regretting that he didn’t have Lil’ Red. If that fool was here, it probably would have found something by now. After all, not a single treasure could escape from Lil’ Red’s eyes. More people started trickling into the palace, but they also failed to discover anything.

“There’s nothing here?”

“Shi Xuan and Song Rui are here, but it doesn’t look like they got anything. There’s something weird about this palace.”

“Lin Yun is also here and it looks like he’s in the same boat.”

“Perhaps this palace didn’t have any treasures…” People started to become irritated as time passed.

Meanwhile, Lin Yun was staring at a wall at the front of the hall. Compared to the other walls, the front wall had different patterns and mysterious ancient runes. However, it felt familiar to Lin Yun.

“Eyes!” Suddenly, a light flashed through his mind. Back in the Hidden Treasure Pavilion where he obtained the Millennium Flame, he saw the illusion of a Golden Crow and its eyes. The more Lin Yun thought about it, the more he noticed that the patterns on the wall looked like a majestic pair of eyes staring at him. The divine pupils of the Golden Crow!

“I don’t believe that there’s nothing here!” Someone became irritated and threw a punch at the wall.

Seeing this, Lin Yun’s face changed as he quickly yelled, “Stop!”
