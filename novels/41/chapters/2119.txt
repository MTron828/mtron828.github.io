Chapter 2120: They're Both Me

Lin Yun and Lil’ Purple left the Iris Secret Realm. But not long after they appeared, the spiritual array within the courtyard was activated. Lin Yun’s courtyard was in the best place at Indigothunder Peak, fortified with several spiritual arrays. Even a Quasi-Saint would have to take some time if they wanted to barge into his courtyard.

Lin Yun took out his medal and injected his nirvana aura into it. When a light screen appeared, they saw that Bai Qingyu was outside, looking at the courtyard curiously.

“Big Brother Ye is still in seclusion? Did something happen to him?” Bai Qingyu muttered with disappointment on her face.

“You scumbag! Look how worried my disciple is! She probably came a few times, judging from her looks!” Lil’ Purple said, feeling a heartache.

“Qingyu, come in.” Lin Yun said as he undid the spiritual array.

Bai Qingyu was already about to leave, but she smiled when she heard the familiar voice. She knew that Ye Qingtian was finally done with his seclusion, so she quickly entered the courtyard.

“Master!” Bai Qingyu’s eyes lit up when she saw Lil’ Purple, and she quickly greeted the latter.

Bai Qingyu could be considered Lil’ Purple’s disciple, but Lil’ Purple didn’t care much about her. Even so, they had a pretty good relationship, so Bai Qingyu tossed Lin Yun aside when she saw Lil’ Purple.

“Big Brother Ye, have you reached the Quasi-Saint Realm?” Bai Qingyu didn’t forget why she was there and looked at Lin Yun with a heated gaze. She had been observing him, hoping that the Sacred Fire Golden Lotus could help him transform and reach the Quasi-Saint Realm.

If Ye Qingtian reached the Quasi-Saint Realm, he would be able to shine brightly on the Blue Dragon Record. She believed Big Brother Ye could obtain the position of a Divine Dragon Lord with his strength. She would have a share of the credit if he became a Divine Dragon Lord. So she had been quietly waiting for Ye Qingtian to finish his seclusion, and she even visited several times, waiting for today.

“Not yet,” Lin Yun replied honestly. He tried to make a breakthrough to the Quasi-Saint Realm once, but it was more difficult than he had imagined. When he was at the ninth transformation of the Nirvana Stage, he could step into the Quasi-Saint Realm anytime he wanted. However, after reaching the tenth transformation of the Nirvana Stage, the bottleneck was several times tougher than before, and it was no longer on the same level.

According to Lil’ Purple, his nirvana aura was already endlessly close to saint aura in terms of quality, and this was why his breakthrough would be tougher. But if he managed to succeed, there was a high possibility that he could immediately reach the Indigo Origin Phase.

“What?!” Bai Qingyu exclaimed. “How is that possible? Even the Sacred Fire Golden Lotus can’t treat your injuries?”

She was worried that Ye Qingtian couldn’t reach the Quasi-Saint Realm in his lifetime.

Lil’ Purple then said, “Don’t worry about him. He succeeded in reaching the tenth transformation of the Nirvana Stage. In terms of cultivation, even ordinary experts at the Indigo Origin Phase might not be his opponent.”

Bai Qingyu was stunned before she excitedly said, “As expected of Big Brother Ye. The tenth transformation of the Nirvana Stage is even tougher than reaching the Quasi-Saint Realm.”

Her eyes were shining brightly with reverence as she spoke. Bai Qingyu was a beauty like her elder sister, except that she looked a little tender in comparison to her sister.

Lin Yun felt awkward upon being looked at by Bai Qingyu. He changed the subject, “Qingyu, what date is it today?”

Bai Qingyu blinked her eyes and said with a smile, “Today is the seventh day of the eighth month in year 3306 of the Divine Dragon Calendar.”

The Blue Dragon Record would appear on the fifteenth of the eighth month, meaning he only had seven days left.

“By the way, Big Brother Ye, you’re on the ranking!” Bai Qingyu thought of something and said excitedly.

“What ranking?” Lin Yun asked. He had always been on the Eastern Desolation’s King Ranking. But after hearing what Bai Qingyu said, he finally knew she meant the Divine Dragon Elite Ranking.

With the imminent appearance of the Blue Dragon Record, everyone came up with multiple rankings, and many forces also had their own rankings. But the Divine Dragon Elite Ranking created by the Sacred Alliance was the one with the highest credibility.

The Sacred Alliance was the most mysterious force within the Kunlun Realm. Most importantly, they have maintained neutrality throughout the years, having a good relationship with the righteous and demonic forces, including the Divine Dragon Empire. The Divine Dragon Empire entrusted many tasks that were inconvenient for them to the Sacred Alliance.

This was because many forces within the Kunlun Realm were hostile to the Divine Dragon Empire, and they couldn’t extend their reach into those forces. But the Sacred Alliance was different. The Kunlun Realm might be massive, but the Sacred Alliance could be found everywhere. Thus, the ranking created by the Sacred Alliance had the highest credibility and was acknowledged by everyone.

Many bets were set up on who could enter the ranking. So even if the Divine Dragon Elite Ranking wasn’t established for long, practically everyone from various holy lands had a copy. This ranking included geniuses from the Eastern Desolation, Western Desert, Southern Border, the Northern Ridge, and Demon Gate.

There were only a hundred people on the ranking, but each had a dazzling existence within the Kunlun Realm.

“Big Brother Ye is the only person to be on the ranking while being at the Nirvana Stage. Everyone else on the ranking are at the Quasi-Saint Realm!” Bai Qingyu said pridefully.

Lin Yun took a look at the ranking and was stumped when he saw it. The first thing he saw was himself, Lin Yun, which even included his introduction.

Lin Yun, also known as Flower Burial. The direct disciple of the Radiant Sword Saint and the champion of the Ninth Heavenly Path. After arriving in the Kunlun Realm, he became the champion of the Empyrean and Elysium Core Rankings. At the Ancient Barren Battlefield, he once slew a Saint Lord while being at the Dragon Pulse Realm. He might’ve used a treasure, but it was still shocking enough. He has received the acknowledgment of the Firmament Saint Cloth, bearing the price of being heavily injured to kill the Nether Divinity Great Saint.

Just when everyone thought he was dead, he reappeared under the moniker Lin Xiao, becoming the champion of the Nirvana Banquet with his song, causing the Three-Lives Tree to bloom. Then, he became the champion of the Dragon Pulse Ranking with the identity of the Nirvana Banquet’s champion, showing an invincible momentum.

He has gone missing for a year, but his name is widely spread throughout the Kunlun Realm. So there is no question that Flower Burial is ranked first on the Divine Dragon Elite Ranking, with no one capable of shaking his position.

Lin Yun was stumped when he read through his introduction. It had been long since he appeared as Lin Yun, so he didn’t expect the Divine Dragon Elite Ranking to rank him first. After all, god knows how many geniuses appeared in the past year. Those in the top ten were at least Quasi-Saints at the Indigo Origin Phase, grasping greater dao. There might even be some who have grasped a Sovereign Dao. It had been long since he last appeared, but his legend was everywhere.

Lin Yun couldn’t help smiling, “Interesting… Why is Flower Burial’s name ranked first? I bet many people are unconvinced about this, right?”

He was fortunate that he was Ye Qingtian now. If he appeared as Lin Yun, many people would be unhappy with him. After all, who could be convinced that Flower Burial became first when there were so many holy sons and holy maidens.

“What are you looking at? That’s Flower Burial. Your name is down below, ?the last one.” Bai Qingyu snatched the ranking over and began flipping through it. Shortly after, her eyes lit up as she said, “Here it is. ‘Ye Qingtian, a genius swordsman of the Heavenly Dao Sect and an underdog who appeared in the past year. Despite being a male, he looks more feminine than a woman, possessing the title of Holy Maiden Killer. He has an explicable relationship with three holy maidens in the Heavenly Dao Sect.’”

Bai Qingyu recited the introduction excitedly, but she didn’t notice that Lin Yun’s face had become ugly.

“‘There were many rumors about him. Some call him a lecher, some call him a gentleman, while some say he’s proficient in harvesting Yin to cultivate. He even has an explicable relationship with the Ninth Princess as they were seen riding a horse together. Regardless of the rumors, his talent as a swordsman is unquestionable. Many older sword saints were filled with praise for him, and some said he might be the next strongest swordsman after the Radiant Sword Saint. His talent as a swordsman could be ranked third, but he’s a complicated person…’”

As Lin Yun’s face became uglier, Lil’ Purple couldn’t hold her laughter back. “Hahaha! He’s complicated, a lecher, and a genius. In my view, they missed out on something. You’re also a scumbag!”

Lin Yun speechlessly closed the book and said, “This ranking isn’t accurate. It’s not credible.”

Lin Yun didn’t expect his two identities to be on the ranking. He initially thought that Bai Qingyu had discovered his true identity, but it turned out that she was talking about Ye Qingtian, who was ranked last.

“I’m not done yet!” Bai Qingyu said, pouting her lips.

“It’s accurate, in my view. Carry on reading,” Lil’ Purple smiled.

After receiving an acknowledgment from Lil’ Purple, she smiled, “Yeah. It’s accurate. Many people couldn’t get on the ranking even if they wanted to. Many people envy you and even claim they wanted to teach you a lesson on the Blue Dragon Record.

“Hmph, they’re simply jealous. If Big Brother Ye was at the Quasi-Saint Realm, you’d reach the top ten at the very least. What do those people know?” Bai Qingyu said furiously.

“The title as the Holy Maiden Killer?is also accurate?” Lin Yun asked.

Bai Qingyu glared at Lin Yun and said, “It might be exaggerated, but it’s not exactly fake. I personally saw you and Wang Muyan flirting with each other back then.”

Lin Yun knew there was no way he could explain his way out now. He changed the topic, “The ranking isn’t accurate. Many people are unconvinced about me being ranked last, but isn’t anyone unconvinced about Flower Burial being ranked first?”

“Why would they be unconvinced? That's Flower Burial we’re talking about. Even the champions of the other Heavenly Paths didn’t say anything about it, so who dares to say that they’re unconvinced?” Bai Qingyu frowned. “He’s the champion of the Nirvana Banquet who made the Three-Lives Tree bloom with his music. Can you imagine how romantic that is? A flower blooms for a tree. Big Brother Ye, you have no idea that Flower Burial has become the dream lover of many girls.”

“I disagree with that,” Lil’ Purple said with disdain.

Bai Qingyu blushed on her innocent face, and she said, “Hehe, I also disagree with that. I think Big Brother Ye looks better, and I like Big Brother Ye more.”

Her ‘like’ wasn’t love but more of admiration. She didn’t find anything wrong with it, when she openly said that. But smiling, she added, “Qingyu also likes Flower Burial.”

Lin Yun was already speechless as he read the ranking. He could no longer eliminate his title as the ‘Holy Maiden Killer.’

“Oh yeah, the phenomenon of the Blue Dragon Record has already appeared,” Bai Qingyu said.

“Where is it?” Lin Yun asked, putting the ranking aside.

“Outside. You can see it if you come out.”T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m
