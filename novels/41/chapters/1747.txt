Chapter 1748 - It Has Been Ten Moves

Li Yuxi’s words caused controversy, and they could hear the grievance filling his tone. Under his rage, his words reached an extreme. But Lin Yun was merely looking at him with an indifferent expression as a cold light flashing across his pupils.

“Lin Xiao, do you dare or not!” Li Yuxi asked as he slowly walked over. When he took ten steps forth, his aura reached a horrifying height, and the pressure he gave off far surpassed Qin Hao, even though they were both at the ninth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm.

As Lin Yun looked at Li Yuxi, he calmly replied, “Firstly, being first at the Nirvana Banquet belongs to me whether you like it or not. So don’t make it sound like you’re letting me have it. Secondly, why do I have to compete with you? Who wants you to go down on your knees? You think too highly of yourself. I won’t even bat an eye at you, even if you want to be my dog for the rest of your life.”

His words naturally caused an uproar because what he said was too ruthless and arrogant.

“Isn’t this fellow a little too arrogant…?” Someone beside the pavilion master couldn’t help speaking out.

The various forces’ elders furrowed their brows, especially those from the Ming Cult. Their pupils were practically blazing with flames. But thinking about it again, there was nothing wrong with what Lin Yun said. Why should he compete with Li Yuxi with the sword? As for kowtowing, who cares?

Lin Yun was arrogant, but he wasn’t a fool. He could only receive a kowtow if he won and would be embarrassed if he lost. If he wasn’t careful, he might even be heavily injured.

“Lin Xiao, you’re courting death!” Li Yuxi nearly went insane when he heard what Lin Yun said, and his face was distorted with anger. Even the faces of Zhang Ying and Chen Jun changed, and they were shocked when they looked at Lin Yun.

Taking a deep breath, Li Yuxi calmed himself down before retrieving a saint sword. He said, “This sword has ten thousand five hundred saint runes engraved on it. It’s a replica of one of the Hidden Sword Manor’s nine Sovereign Saint Swords, Skyhook. If you win, not only will I kowtow to you, but this sword will belong to you. It will be considered your win if I can’t take you down within ten moves. If you lose, you must take back what you said earlier. Today, I’m only fighting for myself!”

Everyone’s faces changed, and they felt Li Yuxi had gone insane.

Lin Yun was briefly surprised before he wore a mocking smile, “You’re so confident that you can defeat me?”

“So, do you dare or not?” Li Yuxi said coldly.

“Since you want to force me to fight, I’ll fulfill your wish, then.” Lin Yun said indifferently.

“Good!” Li Yuxi drew his sword from the sheath. When the sword was drawn out, the sky became dark.

Anyone could tell this was a great sword; an invisible sword aura exploded from Li Yuxi. This was the Firmament Sword Intent at greater mastery. Seeing this, everyone squinted their pupils. They now knew why Li Yuxi could make it into the top hundredth on the Dragon Pulse Ranking.

Fifth-grade Flame Intent, in addition to Firmament Sword Intent, was enough for him to sweep through all the older-generation Dragon Pulse Realm experts.

“Dragon Luring Shackles!” When Li Yuxi drew his sword, he disappeared and only left behind an afterimage while he charged towards Lin Yun.

“The Shadow Sword Technique!” Everyone’s faces changed because they instantly recognized the sword technique that Li Yuxi was performing. This was the transcendent-grade ghost spirit martial technique of the Ming Cult; it was invisible and formless.

When he appeared before Lin Yun, a thread that looked like a shadow instantly manifested into thousands of sword rays. Each sword ray was a fine shadow, and the shadows were like death rays that intertwined and trapped Lin Yun.

This made everyone exclaim because this sword was too shocking. He had no space to dodge. After all, Lin Yun would be heavily injured if a shadow struck him. The fine threads looked thin and fragile, but they were all created by such a strong Flame Intent that even a myriad runes saint armor would be shredded into pieces.

Most importantly, everyone could only see the intertwining shadows. They couldn’t see Li Yuxi clearly. This also meant no one could see how Li Yuxi unleashed his attacks.

But Lin Yun could clearly see the sword’s trajectory with the Sword Heart. A brief moment later, Lin Yun finally moved and used the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute as a sword. When he moved, he pushed the Divine Sunchasing Art to the limit with sunlight shining from him. When he swung the flute, it collided with the incoming shadows.

Along with metallic clashes, Li Yuxi’s sword rays were shattered by the flute, and Lin Yun didn’t take long to break the Dragon Luring Shackles. Under the explosion of sword rays, Li Yuxi’s figure was forced to appear, and his sword clashed with Lin Yun’s jade flute.Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

This surprised Li Yuxi before he divided himself into nine, with each sword accompanied by flames. The flames manifested into various phenomena. There were dragons, a sea, a moon, a battlefield, a wall, and many more.

But Lin Yun relied on his Sword Heart to resolve Li Yuxi’s attacks, and his flute easily destroyed the nine phenomena.

“Thousand Shadows!” Li Yuxi calmly executed the third sword. This time, the phenomenon he created was even more unbelievable, leaving thousands of black afterimages behind when he flickered, with each afterimage swinging a sword.

While each afterimage swung a sword, each sword was different. But the thousand afterimages felt like an entity. So Lin Yun would have to face them as an entity, regardless of which afterimage he faced, and this was a profound sword technique.

This even surprised the elders present; everyone now knew where Li Yuxi’s confidence came from.

But Lin Yun didn’t panic, he had a faint smile. When Li Yuxi unleashed his attack, Lin Yun also moved, and he resolved this attack with his Sword Heart. The afterimages might seem like an entity, but each afterimage had a flaw. So as long as he could accurately find the flaw in those afterimages, it would be easy to deal with this attack.

“Break!” Lin Yun roared, as he soared to the sky like a sun. As he spun in mid-air, he unleashed countless sword rays with the jade flute in his hand. Struck by the sword rays, the afterimages shattered before they drizzled down like snowflakes. This was because nothing could be hidden from the Sword Heart.

When Lin Yun landed on the ground, Li Yuxi already dashed over with his sword. But Lin Yun reacted as though he had already expected this scene beforehand. When Li Yuxi landed on the ground, his attack reached the limit, two inches away from Lin Yun.

But Li Yuxi wasn’t willing to give up and took two steps forth, while Lin Yun took two steps back in response. The two-inch was like a gulf that Li Yuxi could never cross, no matter how he tried.

This naturally made Li Yuxi inwardly curse. As he retreated, he unleashed the fourth sword. As the wind rose on the Nirvana Stage, a bizarre scene occurred. Li Yuxi’s sword techniques were brilliant, and each attack could draw an exclamation from the surroundings. But whenever he swung his sword, Lin Yun could block it.

Just like that, the famous Shadow Sword Technique was nothing before Lin Yun, and this nearly made everyone’s jaws drop, especially the Ming Cult’s disciples. They couldn’t figure out how Lin Yun managed to accomplish this.

The eyes of the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion’s pavilion master flickered, and he had a speculation. But that speculation made him even more shocked. Can it be that Lin Xiao has grasped the Sword Heart? But how is that possible? Not many swordsmen in the Samsara Edict Realm can grasp the Sword Heart. So just how strong is Lin Xiao’s talent for him to grasp Sword Heart at such a young age? Upon realizing that, the pavilion master’s face changed.

“It has been ten moves.” A cold voice suddenly resounded from the stage, and there weren’t any emotions.

The Ming Cult’s disciples felt a bucket of cold water pouring down on them when they heard that, and they were shocked. Ten moves were over so quickly? Not only was Lin Yun still standing, but he didn’t even suffer any injuries.

Li Yuxi’s face changed. Recalling what he said earlier, his heart throbbed violently with fear enveloping his heart.

“I have a sword, and I’d like to seek guidance from Brother Li.” Just when Li Yuxi felt uncertain, Lin Yun raised his head to coldly look at him.
