Chapter 1364 - Go!

Zhuge Qingyun first defeated Lin Zhen before he faced six Samsara Edict Realm experts, defeating all six of them. At this moment, the aura that he was giving off reached a limit and intimidated everyone in the surroundings.

“Profound Sky Saint Sovereign, invincible in the Ancient Barren Domain!”

“Profound Sky Saint Sovereign, invincible in the Ancient Barren Domain!” After a brief silence, everyone from the Profound Sky Sect cheered. But compared to them, the other powerful sects, including the Sword Sect, all wore ugly expressions as they looked at Zhuge Qingyun with fear in their pupils and cold sweat covering their backs.

They now knew why Zhuge Qingyun was called the strongest disciple of Tian Xuanzi. After all, Zhuge Qingyun hadn’t reached the Saint Realm, and his master rose up the fastest in the Ancient Barren Domain in the past millennium. So everyone couldn’t imagine how strong Tian Xuanzi was.

Zhuge Qingyun stood in the air while elegantly fanning himself with his fan before he coldly said, “Is this all you guys got? And you guys want me to back down? You guys are just a bunch of trash. So what if you guys joined forces? One trash or a bunch of trash makes no difference.”

The other Samsara Edict Realm experts’ faces turned red when they heard that, but there was nothing they could say. After all, it was simply too humiliating that they lost so terribly even after they joined forces. Most importantly, Zhuge Qingyun was still young and was barely a hundred years old.

“You’ve won. So you can do what you want now, even if you want our lives!” Lin Zhen coldly said. “But it’s impossible if you want me to hand over Lin Yun!”

The Samsara Edict Realm experts from the other powerful sects’ faces changed and were shocked. After reaching their realm, it was rare for them to kill their opponents, even if they had a huge feud. After all, defeating and killing were two different concepts.

A Samsara Edict Realm expert was the foundation and core of a sect. The moment someone kills another Samsara Edict Realm expert from another sect, it was no different from waging war. The reason why they dared to stand up against Zhuge Qingyun was that they were confident that Zhuge Qingyun wouldn’t kill them. Then again, they also wouldn’t take Zhuge Qingyun’s life if they managed to win.

But there were some rules that everyone had acknowledged. Since they had lost, then they should allow Zhuge Qingyun to take Lin Yun away by right. But what Lin Zhen said was no different than flipping the table, not to mention that they already couldn’t put up a fight against Lin Zhen.

Then again, as Samsara Edict Realm experts, they naturally have their trump cards. But the moment they brout them out, it would be the same as a life and death battle, and they didn’t think that it was worth it for the Great Saint Origin.

“Brother Lin, we’ve already kept up to the alliance. But if it involves life and death, then I’m sorry about it,” said the middle-aged man who was the Samsara Edict Realm representative from the Profound Valley. His injuries were the heaviest, so he was the first to speak up. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“This is a matter between the Sword Sect and the Profound Sky Sect. So there’s no need for you guys to apologize,” replied Lin Zhen calmly as he wielded his sword with a firm gaze. Sword Sect’s disciples could be defeated, but they would never submit to their opponents. As a Sword-Bearing Elder, he naturally wouldn’t back down, either. As a swordsman, he had no fear of death.

Zhuge Qingyun’s face sank when he heard that and locked his brows together while tightening his grip on his fan because Lin Zhen was making things difficult for him. It was easy for him to defeat Lin Zhen, but he would definitely have to pay a price if he wanted to kill him. Most importantly, if he killed a Sword-Bearing Elder of the Sword Sect, who knew what chaos might be incurred?

“You’re weak, and you have such a foul temper. Your Sword Sect is really hateful!” Zhuge Qingyun gritted his teeth.

Raising his brow, Lin Zhen replied, “You can go ahead and make a move to see if I’m truly weak. Why spend so much saliva on words?”

Seeing Lin Zhen being so stubborn, Zhuge Qingyun suddenly laughed coldly, “Since you’re courting death, then I’ll fulfill your wish. Today, I’ll break your pride as a swordsman!”

“Martial Uncle! Lin Yun escaped!” Right at that moment, a Dragon Pulse Realm expert from the Profound Sky Sect exclaimed with his face changed. Feng Jue had sneaked away when Zhuge Qingyun attacked with the Universal Reversal, creating a huge commotion and drawing everyone’s attention. So when the Dragon Pulse Realm expert recovered from his shock, he then noticed that Lin Yun had already fled.

Zhuge Qingyun’s face changed when he heard that. When he swept his gaze around, Lin Yun was really nowhere to be found. As he looked further away, he saw two blurred figures. They were Feng Jue and Lin Yun, who fled.

This made Zhuge Qingyun shocked before he smiled. “No wonder he’s the stupidest disciple of the Radiant Sword Saint. Run? How can he possibly run? Lin Zhen, you don’t have to die now. Hahaha!”

Zhuge Qingyun laughed. He did think that Lin Yun might escape, but the reason why he paid no attention to Lin Yun was that there was no need for him to do so. Without Lin Zhen’s protection, an Elysium Core Realm was nothing but an ant before him.

Although Feng Jue was also a Samsara Edict Realm expert, Feng Jue was no different to an ant in his eyes. So it was perfect for him that Feng Jue fled with Lin Yun because this meant that he didn’t have to engage Lin Zhen in a life and death battle.

Swordsmen were different from other martial cultivators because they didn’t fear death. If they really placed their lives on the line, then there was a possibility that even he might be heavily injured. Sending Lin Zhen back with a palm, Zhuge Qingyun laughed, “The shame of the Radiant Sword Saint, he really deserves his reputation!”

As he laughed, Zhuge Qingyun soared to the sky and entered the clouds in the blink of an eye. This scene made Lin Zhen’s face ugly because he had no idea what Feng Jue was trying to do. With Feng Jue’s strength, it was simply impossible for him to escape from Zhuge Qingyun.

Most importantly, where could Feng Jue flee to? Who else in the Profound Azure Prefecture could face Zhuge Qingyun? Could it be that Feng Jue wanted to flee back to the Sword Sect with Lin Yun? That was simply ridiculous if that was what Feng Jue was planning!

“Feng Jue seems to be heading in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s direction…” Right at that moment, the old monk from the Vajra Monastery spoke up. He couldn’t figure out why Feng Jue didn’t head in the Sword Sect’s direction, but was heading in the opposite direction and heading towards the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, instead.

The Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect was pretty far, but it was nothing to Samsara Edict Realm experts. If they pushed their movement technique to the limit, it was not an issue for them to make it over in just two hours.

Lin Zhen’s face drastically changed when he thought of something and raged, “That bastard!”

When he finished, he ignored his injuries and chased after Zhuge Qingyun.

“That Feng Jue is really the shame of the Radiant Sword Saint. If Lin Zhen insisted on protecting Lin Yun, there might’ve been a chance that Lin Yun could live. But he has ruined it all now.”

“But there’s something wrong with Lin Zhen’s earlier reaction.”

“Is there anyone in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect?”

“So what? Not even the six of us can put up a fight against Zhuge Qingyun. So who else can suppress him?” the other Samsara Edict Realm experts were also surprised by Feng Jue’s response.

“Let’s go and take a look, then.” The grey-clothed old man from the Heavenly Blade Pavilion said and followed behind Lin Zhen.

“Let’s go!” Everyone was curious as to why Feng Jue went in that direction and didn’t hesitate at all.

Pushing his movement technique to the limit, Feng Jue practically flashed like a bolt of lightning. But Lin Yun had no joy on his face. Feng Jue was fast, a lot faster than his Golden Crow Wings. But it was still too slow when compared to Zhuge Qingyun, not to mention that Feng Jue had to bring him along. So there was no doubt that Zhuge Qingyun would catch up with them, sooner or later.

“Senior Brother, you think we can survive till we reach the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect?” Lin Yun began to regret it now. For some reason, he felt that they might have some chance if they stayed behind. Lin Zhen might be heavily injured, but he was at least more reliable than Feng Jue.

“Don’t worry about it. Even if Zhuge Qingyun catches up to us, I’ll hold him back, so you can leave by yourself,” said Feng Jue with a firm expression.

Lin Yun was carrying Lil’ Red in his embrace as the corner of his lips twitched and replied, “But you went down on your knees earlier in just three moves…”

He was already giving Feng Jue face by saying three. In reality, Feng Jue only lasted two moves or if Zhuge Qingyun wanted, he could have easily dealt with Feng Jue with just a move. But Feng Jue was still his senior brother, so Lin Yun naturally had to give him some face.

Hearing what Lin Yun said, Feng Jue wore an awkward expression and argued, “What nonsense. That’s because I wasn’t able to bring out my firmament sword intent earlier. Otherwise, I could at least last ten… no, wait… at least five moves…”

Feng Jue had no confidence in his tone at all, but he argued that there was a gap of a decade between them. After all, Zhuge Qingyun had reached the Samsara Edict Realm a decade ago. Then again, this was also because he didn’t have the face to say that because Zhuge Qingyun was younger than him, and it wasn’t glorious that Zhuge Qingyun had a higher cultivation than him.

Lin Yun didn’t ask much about it. The six experts were all defeated by Zhuge Qingyun. Even if Feng Jue only lasted two moves… Lin Yun also had to admit that it was pretty humiliating.

“What’s that?” Lin Yun suddenly discovered that there was a scarlet light streaking over. Shortly after, white, black, blue, and five other different colors of light appeared and Lin Yun realized that it was Zhuge Qingyun, who had caught up to them. This made Lin Yun widen his mouth and didn’t know what to say.

“Go!” Feng Jue threw Lin Yun down and gave him a palm, using the momentum to push Lin Yun ahead. At the same time, his sword aura began to explode and tore a crack in the rainbow light, allowing Lin Yun to be sent out and rolled on the ground.

When Lin Yun turned his head back, Zhuge Qingyun was already before Feng Jue and didn’t even bother with him. This made rage start to boil in Lin Yun’s heart because it felt terrible that he was neglected since he couldn’t even pose the slightest threat. At this moment, he really didn’t want to leave.
