Chapter 1091 - Fleeting Cloud Sect Master

Lin Yun thought about the Imperial Feather Realm Son’s interspatial pouch. It still contained his Azure Dragon True Bone. With a gentle shake of his hand, Lin Yun poured out everything from the Imperial Feather Realm Son’s interspatial pouch to see what else was there.

A huge pile of Divine Astral Pellets appeared before him that emitted faint golden flames and dense astral energy. Somehow, the Imperial Feather Realm Son only had Divine Astral Pellets that had no impurities.

Even in Kunlun Realm, the Divine Astral Pellets were extremely precious that not anyone could have. Looking at the pile, Lin Yun roughly estimated 8,000 pellets. Then again, Lin Yun wasn’t too surprised because the Divine Astral Pellets were extremely precious in the Heavenly Path and could only be found in the ancient runes.

Aside from using them to cultivate, the Divine Astral Pellets could also be used to set up arrays, refining artifacts, and pellets. So the Divine Astral Pellets were sacred resources. Looking at the pile of Divine Astral Pellets, Lin Yun felt satisfied because he really needed to reach the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm. If he didn’t have a good enough foundation, it would be impossible for him to reach the limit of Demonic Astral Flowers in his aura oceans.

“All mine!” Lin Yun put the pellets away and looked at the rest of the pouch. There were tons of treasures, but they didn’t catch Lin Yun’s attention. “You can have them all,” said Lin Yun.

There was no question that the treasures of the Imperial Feather Realm Son were extremely valuable, but they couldn’t compare to the Nine-Leaf Saint Fruit. After all, it was only second to the Divine Blood Fruit in the Heavenly Path.

When Lil’ Red heard Lin Yun’s words, it nodded its head. Then, it swallowed all of the treasures. Lil’ Red wasn’t eating the treasures, but putting them into the interspatial pouch in its belly. Otherwise, Lil’ Red would have been blown to smithereens.

There were also saint pellets that Lin Yun recognized, but it was a pity that there weren’t many Blood Flame Pellets or True Dragon Saint Liquid. Those could be found easily only in the Heavenly Path. But in Kunlun Realm, even Empyreans or Elysium Core experts couldn’t get them easily.

“Ten Blood Flame Pellets and nine droplets of True Dragon Saint Liquid… looks like the Imperial Feather Realm Son wasn’t as wealthy as I thought,” muttered Lin Yun while storing the Bloodflame Pellets and True Dragon Saint Liquid.

If the Imperial Feather Realm Son were alive to hear Lin Yun, he would have been angered to death. After all, Blood Flame Pellets were normally used to cultivate holy spirit martial techniques and were precious even for empyreans. As for the True Dragon Saint Liquid, there was naturally nothing to say. It was beneficial to cultivators even if they didn’t practice body-refining martial techniques.

Aside from these treasures, Lin Yun also found a few incomplete books, golden jade slips, and two holy spirit martial techniques.

The two holy spirit martial techniques were the Heavenly Meteorite Fist and Imperial Dragon Fist. They were both fist techniques, which could be useful. The Imperial Dragon Fist also had a secret technique called the Imperial Dragon Seal. Lin Yun suddenly noticed that the Heavenly Meteorite Fist was complete while the Imperial Dragon Fist wasn’t. The Imperial Dragon Seal looked like an extremely terrifying secret technique of the dragon clan.

The Imperial Feather Realm Son was only able to comprehend it because he had the Flame Dragon’s Heart. Lin Yun had observed both martial techniques in his fight with the Imperial Feather Realm Son. He benefited from watching them because it improved his fist technique and sword dao greatly.

Placing the two jade slips down, Lin Yun’s eyes were shining because he was comprehending his last fight. He had a lot of insights from the Heavenly Path and didn’t have time to digest them all. So he needed some time to go into seclusion to sort through his harvest.

“The Imperial Feather Realm Son is really terrifying. If he was just one step better in the Imperial Dragon Fist, the outcome of the final battle wouldn’t have been so clear cut.” Lin Yun muttered. “Looks like I have to thank him for stealing my Azure Dragon True Bone. If my sky sword intent didn’t reach complete mastery, I wouldn’t have been able to deal with his trump card. I might have lost…”

“Hmmm?” Suddenly, Lin Yun’s attention was attracted by a jade bottle. The jade bottle was transparent with a pellet sealed inside. Picking up the jade bottle, Lin Yun examined it carefully from the outside and saw a golden pellet with ancient runes engraved on it.

“It’s the Nirvana Pellet!” Lin Yun’s eyelid twitches because the value of this saint pellet was unimaginable. Did every realm son have one? He remembered the Nether Divinity Realm Son taking one when he was near death. It instantly helped him recover from his injuries, and grew even stronger through the process.

With his eyes flashing, Lin Yun quickly flipped through the rest of the Realm Sons’ interspatial pouches. Aside from the pouches belonging to the Nether Divinity, Profound Dragon, and Elysium Trigram Realm Sons, each realm son had a Nirvana Pellet in their interspatial pouches.

Lin Yun had joy on his face when he saw all seven Nirvana Pellets. After all, he basically had seven lives now. It might sound a little exaggerated, but Lin Yun knew how heavily injured the Nether Divinity Realm Son was.

“It’s just a mere Nirvana Pellet. Back then, a single breath of mine was equivalent to hundreds of Nirvana Pellets, and a drop of my blood could make a saint bow towards me. Look at what a country bumpkin you are!” Lil’ Purple snorted in disdain. But in reality, she was taking a look at the pellets. “Hmph, they’re rubbish. Even the herbs I ate daily back then were a lot more precious.”

Lin Yun ignored her and happily put the Nirvana Pellets away. Then, he retrieved the Azure Dragon True Bone. Looking at the bone in his hand, he locked his brows together because he had no idea how to fuse this bone into his body again.

Back then, the fusion was done by the Azure Dragon Lord. Although the process was painful, it was the safest method. Since he didn’t know how to fuse the bone, he was worried that he would leave behind many hidden injuries. In the end, he needed a safe method.

“The Azure Dragon True Bone!” Lil’ Purple’s eyes suddenly shined as she chuckled, “Hehe, Lin Yun, since the bone was extracted, why don’t you give it to me? When you reach the sixteenth stage in the Iris Sword Sutra, I can use it.”

“Why do you need it?” Lin Yun asked cautiously.

“What has it got to do with you?” Lil’ Purple snorted.

“Oh.” Lin Yun replied before calmly putting the Azure Dragon True Bone away.

Seeing Lin Yun’s indifferent attitude, Lil’ Purple flared up, “I’m angry now!”

“Haha.” Lin Yun smiled before he continued to sort through the treasures of the other Realm Sons. He was in a good mood, and he couldn’t be bothered with Lil’ Purple right now.

“Urghhh! You’re really getting on my nerves!” Lil’ Purple began to jump around in Lin Yun’s subconscious space with puffed up cheeks, “I’ll burn you to death! Burn! Burn!”

Lil’ Purple then began to flap her hands up and down. Only when she was exhausted did she realize that she was no longer in her ice phoenix form. So she fell to the ground and rolled around.

While Lin Yun was going through his harvest, Feng Jue was meeting with the sect master. The sect master’s name was Wang Jue and he looked a lot older than Feng Jue. His hair was gray and he had a long beard. However, his eyes shined with pride.

“He dealt with ten Realm Sons, crippling five and killing the other five… He really has a huge temper,” said the sect master indifferently.

“I wouldn’t bring him here if he didn’t have a huge temper. But no matter how big his temper is, it’s not as big as yours.” Feng Jue chuckled. He had always felt that his temper was nothing compared to the gray-haired elder before him.

Back then, Wang Jue left the Sword Sect on a whim and slaughtered thousands of Profound Sky Sect’s disciples. It was something that shocked the entire Ancient Barren Domain. If it wasn’t for the Sword Sect protecting him and leaving him in this remote place, he would be dead by now.

Wang Jue glared at Feng Jue and said indifferently, “Speak, why did you bring him here? I don’t think my small Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect can nurture a dragon like him…”

“Sure you can.” Feng Jue smiled before he wore a serious expression, “Master is going to take in a new disciple…”

When Feng Jue said that, Wang Jue’s hand trembled. Feng Jue stopped smiling because Wang Jue looked like he was still affected by what happened in the past. He was master’s last disciple, and ever since Wang Jue ‘left’ the sect back then, their master hadn’t taken in another disciple since. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“I’ll accept him,” said Wang Jue while putting his cup down.

Feng Jue’s face changed slightly before he continued, “Someone tried to become master’s disciple. He’s the heir of Xiahou Clan, Xiahou Yan. He has the Xiantian Saint Physique and Xiantian Sword heart. But even so, our master rejected him. If news gets out that the master took on a new disciple, it will surely shock the entire Eastern Desolation. Lin Yun can’t bear that pressure with his current strength. So he needs to stay and train for a year. He needs to reach the appropriate cultivation as a test. If he can’t…”

“He will make it through,” interrupted Wang Jue with confidence.

Feng Jue was briefly stunned before he changed the topic, “That lass can already head to Sword Sect. Since I’m here, I might as well take her with me.”

Wang Jue shook his head and replied, “She’s even more stubborn than me. The ranking battle for the Profound Azure Palace will be starting soon, and she won’t leave before that.”

Upon hearing that, Feng Jue let out a sigh. He finally understood what was going on with Ye Ziling.
