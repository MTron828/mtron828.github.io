Chapter 915 - Trial in the Flames

Qin Feng and the others followed Lin Yun to the barrier. Compared to the initial high temperature, the temperature wasn’t unbearable anymore. More importantly, the phenomenon on the top of the barrier had also calmed down.

When they stepped through the barrier, they sensed a dense astral energy in the atmosphere. The Glorysun Spirit was born from the sun, which meant that the astral energy had to be dense.

Lin Yun roughly sensed the astral energy in the atmosphere and was surprised because it was only slightly inferior to the divine astral pellets.

“The astral energy here is so dense. It’s a lot more refined than the astral energy in astral pellets. Plus, we don’t even have to refine it.” Chen Xuan and the others were shocked, but they couldn’t really see anything because of the blinding light of the barrier.

Despite the sword intent in his eyes, Lin Yun also couldn’t see. He could only rely on his senses to continue forward. It didn’t take long for him to get separated from everyone else because of an unknown force.

The inside of the barrier was a secret realm that kicked out those who stayed too long. One needed sufficient strength to stay.

“The Glorysun Spirit should be in the deepest part of the realm,” said Lin Yun. He knew that he couldn’t be too anxious because he had to be prepared for other dangers in the secret realm.

An hour later, the light finally dimmed down and the surroundings cleared up. In the distance, layers of fog enveloped an ancient gold gate.

At this moment, ten flaming birds flew out of the gate who were emitting intense heat as they flapped their wings. Instantly, Lin Yun realized he was in a trial that was adjusted to his strength.

The flaming birds were only in the first soul Heavenly Soul Realm. If everyone had to face the same number of birds at the first soul level, it would be tough for anyone to move forward. The only people who would have no problems would be the geniuses from the higher realms.

The flaming birds shrieked and then charged at Lin Yun with flames covering their claws. Lin Yun was caught off guard, but he sensed that the flaming birds weren’t real. As long as he could destroy them quickly, they wouldn’t be able to harm him. It wasn’t a hard task for him, but it would create trouble for others.

Circulating both sword sutras at the same time, Lin Yun instantly destroyed all ten birds.

“Why is it so hard?”

“They can regenerate?!”

“Damn it! Are we going to lose just like this?!” At this moment, Chen Xuan, Qin Feng, and Yan Kui had beads of sweat dripping from their faces. As for Liu Yun, he also grasped the spiritual sword intent, so he was able to kill three of the flaming birds. If nothing went wrong, it wouldn’t be a problem for him to pass the trial.

For Liu Yun, the trial was an excellent opportunity because he hadn’t gone through his tribulation yet. Since the astral energy was comparable to divine astral pellets, his cultivation would quickly grow. He wouldn’t even need a treasure as long as he spent enough time here. By the time Liu Yun destroyed all ten flaming birds, he realized that his cultivation had taken another step.

“I see… I can absorb the astral energy here even in battle. This astral energy contains fire attribute energy that can cleanse the impurities in my origin energy!” Liu Yun’s eyes flashed with excitement.

Since there were people making it through the trial, there were naturally those who failed. When they failed, they could sense a force rejecting them. It would push down on them while they frantically absorbed the astral energy to resist the pressure.𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

After all, staying here for a moment was equivalent to refining hundreds of astral pellets. However, in the end, everyone that failed was kicked out of the barrier. Even so, their faces were full of smiles.

Qin Feng and Yan Kui were practically kicked out at the same time, but they still had joy in their eyes. In just a short amount of time, they managed to reach the pinnacle first soul Heavenly Soul Realm.

“Chen Xuan isn’t out yet. He can probably undergo the second tribulation after he comes out,” said Qin Feng while looking at the barrier.

“I wonder what Lin Yun’s limit is,” said Yan Kui. He knew that most geniuses from the higher realms would fail the test, so not many people would see the Glorysun Spirit.

“This place is such a treasure! Too bad the city is so damaged. Otherwise, the effects of going through the tribulation here would be similar to using divine astral pellets.” Mo Han, who had gotten through the third trial, was shocked to sense the boundless energy pouring into his aura oceans. The astral energy was so dense that it had formed into a faint mist around him.

In just a short moment, he had reached the tenth stage of his cultivation and was one step away from complete mastery.

“Interesting. Feng Wuji is definitely turning in his grave right now. If he was alive, he would feel so much regret fighting Lin Yun before entering the barrier.” Mo Han’s eyes flashed coldly. With his cultivation technique in its tenth stage, he was confident that Lin Yun’s spiritual sword intent in complete mastery couldn’t restrict him.

Luckily for Mo Han, Feng Wuji was able to probe Lin Yun’s strength for him. Otherwise, he might also die.

Unlike others, Lin Yun didn’t refine much of the astral energy in the atmosphere. The astral energy was dense, but it wasn’t comparable to the divine astral pellets. Even if he cultivated here for an entire day, it would only be like refining a hundred divine astral pellets. Divine astral pellets were refined by empyreans, so the astral energy in the atmosphere couldn’t compare to it.

Although he entered the barrier late, he was ahead of many people. While others were struggling, Lin Yun had already reached the ninth test. On the ninth test, he met an image of a flaming gold crow whose aura was the same as Feng Wuji’s aura. Unfortunately for the crow, it lacked intelligence.

When the golden bird flew over, it released immense pressure as it flapped its wings. The pressure was so strong that the surrounding space began to tremble. At the same time, it flew with incredible speed that surprised Lin Yun. His only choice was to direct his dragon runes into his arms to block the attack as fast as he could. Although he was able to withstand the attack, the azure dragon image around him was full of cracks.

“Seven Slaughtering Fist!” After Lin Yun took the golden crow’s attack head-on, he quickly threw a punch and caught the golden crow by surprise. Hitting the golden crow, a few flaming feathers floated in the air.

“What a powerful defense…” Lin Yun gasped for air because the golden crow was practically unharmed. Then again, the Seven Slaughtering Fist’s grade wasn’t even a fortune martial technique. It couldn’t keep up with Lin Yun’s cultivation anymore.

When the golden crow turned its body in mid-air, its plume feathers gently trembled in the air as it started to suppress Lin Yun’s sword intent into it.

“Azure Dragon Breath, Eight Seals!” After drinking the Millennium Flame, Lin Yun’s aura ocean had grown to 60,000 meters. So he could easily execute the Flamecloud Incinerating Palm with the azure dragon breath.

A black dragon claw appeared behind Lin Yun that flew towards the golden crow. When it clashed with the golden crow, countless flaming feathers and black scales rained down from the sky. With another hit, the golden crow was knocked backwards.

But even after the golden crow fell to the ground, it still tried to flap its wings to attack Lin Yun.

“How annoying!” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly as he lost his patience. Grabbing his sword, he unleashed a brilliant sword ray that devoured the golden crow.

Looking down at the Flower Burial Sword, Lin Yun could see that the floral runes on the sword were gradually merging together. It wouldn’t be long before the runes formed one complete run, which meant that it would upgrade to a dao artifact soon.
