Chapter 1424 - This Is Impossible!

Before the Sword Emperor Yu Qingfeng came to the Sword Sect, it was the strongest sect for swordsmen in the Eastern Desolation, with nine peaks. They were the The Divine Firmament, Scarlet Firmament, Emerald Firmament, Azure Firmament, Profound Firmament, Indigo Firmament, Golden Firmament, Grand Firmament, and Pellet Firmament. But Yu Qingfeng leveled two peaks, removing the Grand Firmament and Pellet Firmament. This was why the Sword Sect fell and was no longer a holy land.

Amongst the seven remaining peaks, the Profound Firmament Peak was responsible for forging weapons, while the Emerald Firmament Peak was responsible for refining elixirs. That meant that there were only five peaks that passed down sword inheritances. The Scarlet Firmament, Gold Firmament, Azure Firmament, Indigo Firmament, and the Divine Firmament Peak, where the Radiant Sword Saint was located.

The Scarlet Firmament Peak was the main peak, having the strongest foundation since ancient times; the past sect masters of the Sword Sect were also masters of the Scarlet Firmament Peak. The remaining peaks had their own unique resources and inheritances, so the Scarlet Firmament Peak couldn’t monopolize the entire sect. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

The six saints were the Grand Elders from the various peaks, each possessing a different inheritance. Aside from the Divine Firmament Peak, even the saints from the Profound Firmament and Emerald Firmament Peaks have shown up.

“Jue Chen greets all the Grand Elders.” The grey-clothed elder bowed as he looked at the six saints with respect. In the Ancient Barren Domain, a clan that produced a saint could be considered a Saint Clan, and it was a top-tiered force, no matter how you looked at it.

Saints were the foundations of a clan or sect to be considered a top-tiered force. So aside from those sects with a long legacy, most of a sect’s foundation was on the saints. Otherwise, it would be a joke even if a force had existed for tens of thousands of years without having a saint.

The six saints’ appearances were no different from an ordinary person’s. If one looked closely, one would realize that something was strange. Even if you could see them, you couldn’t register their appearances in your mind. They were enveloped in saint lights that made them look ethereal. They gave off a feeling that they were far from their reach. This was because they were no longer mortals once they reached the Saint Realm.

“Who’s first?” An old man out of the six saints, donned in a scarlet robe, asked with a smile.

“I’ll go first.” A grey-haired elder donned in a green robe said, “This old man is the master of the Emerald Firmament Peak. You can call me Emerald Water Saint Lord. The Emerald Firmament Peak mainly refines elixirs for the Sword Sect, but the elixir dao and sword dao aren’t that different. If you can become a saint through the elixir dao, your swordsmanship won’t be weak, either. Of course, it’s somewhat inferior to the other peaks. I won’t force it if any of you aren’t willing.”

Nearly a hundred people were present, and they all had the qualification to be chosen as a disciple by the saints. Their eyes lit up when they heard what the Emerald Water Saint Lord said. The Emerald Water Saint Lord was humble with what he said. Even if the Emerald Firmament Peak’s inheritance was inferior to the others, this still meant that they didn’t lack resources, especially when becoming a disciple of an elixir saint.

Even if your attainment in the sword dao was inferior to others, you would still have a high position if you managed to learn a thing or two. So no one would reject becoming a disciple of an elixir saint. This made everyone anxious as they looked at the Emerald Water Saint Lord.

“Ye Qing, are you willing to take this old man as your master?” The Emerald Water Saint Lord spoke without any hesitation. This clearly meant that he already had a candidate in his mind. His gaze fell onto Ye Qing, who was next to Ye Ziyun.

“Me?!” Ye Qing was puzzled. After all, he didn’t expect a saint to choose him, since he was mainly here to accompany Ye Ziyun.

“That’s right, you. No one else is more suitable than you to become my disciple.” The Emerald Water Saint Lord smiled. “Your achievement in elixir dao should be the strongest amongst everyone here.”

Ye Qing was excited when he heard that, but he soon thought of something and asked, “Senior, can I give this opportunity to my cousin, instead? Her achievement in the elixir dao isn’t weak, and the Radiant Snow Clan’s bloodline has a natural advantage in refining elixirs. Her bloodline is stronger than mine.”

But Ye Ziyun’s face turned dark when she heard Ye Qing. To be chosen by a saint was a great fortune, and yet Ye Qing wanted to give it away?

“The Radiant Snow Clan’s bloodline has an advantage when refining elixirs?” Zhao Yan looked at Ye Ziling. This was the first time he had heard that.

“I don’t know, but the Radiant Snow Clan’s bloodline can control ice and lightning. It’s rare to find anyone who can control both ice and lightning in the Divine Dragon Era, so perhaps it has something to do with that…” Ye Ziyun said. She left the Radiant Snow Clan at the age of ten, so she wasn’t too clear about many things.

“She has her own fortune. If you don’t want to become my disciple, I won’t force you.” The Emerald Water Saint Lord smiled; he wasn’t angry at all.

“Ye Qing, greet your master quickly!” Ye Ziyun hollered.

Ye Qing was stunned before he stepped forth and went down on one knee. “Disciple Ye Qing greets Master.”

“Haha. Good. Come over here!” The Emerald Water Saint Lord was clearly fond of Ye Qing for a long time. He laughed as he brought Ye Qing to his side after Ye Qing paid his respects.

“That guy is really lucky…”

“What shitty luck…” Xiahou Yun and the four brothers of the Huang Clan were naturally unhappy. This was because they believed that they were better than Ye Qing. So the Emerald Water Saint Lord was blind to be picking Ye Qing over them.

The Profound Firmament Peak’s saint stepped forth next. The Profound Firmament Peak mainly cultivated in the way of spiritual runes. So aside from forging weapons, they were also responsible for maintaining various arrays within the sect. Likewise, this saint chose someone no one expected, but no one thought much about it. After all, it wasn’t a real inheritance of the sword dao.

“I’m the master of the Azure Firmament Peak, and you can call me the Azure Storm Saint Lord. I believe I don’t have to say much for the Azure Firmament Peak’s inheritance. You’ll naturally understand after becoming my disciple.” When the old man in an azure robe spoke, an uproar broke out within the surroundings. They all knew that the main event was here.

Everyone’s eyes fell onto geniuses like Lin Yun, Jiang Cheng, Ye Ziyun, Chen Bing, Huang Yancheng, and Xiahou Yan. They stood out in the third stage and were much stronger than others by a considerable margin. They weren’t on the same level at all, so it was likely that the saints would pick their disciples from amongst them.

“Jiang Cheng, are you willing to take this old man as your master?” The Azure Storm Saint Lord clearly had a candidate in mind as he looked at Jiang Cheng with a smile.

But the faces of Xiahou Yan, Chen Bing, and Huang Yancheng were ugly since they weren’t chosen. They were determined to become disciples of the saints and didn’t acknowledge every stage. In their views, only the Scarlet Firmament Peak could be somewhat accepted by them. They never thought of joining the other peaks.

Xiahou Yan was under the delusion that he could refuse others, but others had to choose him. While the corner of Xiahou Yan’s lip twitched, Chen Bing and Huang Yancheng’s faces were ugly because they couldn’t accept that they weren’t chosen.

“I’m naturally willing. Disciple Jiang Cheng greets Master!” Jiang Cheng naturally had no reason to refuse as he stepped forth.

“I hope you won’t let down the prestige of the Azure Firmament Peak and the Jiang Clan.” The Azure Storm Saint Lord smiled. He had great hopes for Jiang Cheng.

“Ye Ziling, are you willing to take me as your master?” The Indigo Lightning Saint Lord of the Indigo Firmament Peak stepped forth. He looked stern without any expression as he went straight into the topic.

“This…” Xiahou Yan was dumbfounded. Even Chen Bing and Huang Yancheng’s faces were ugly as they looked at Ye Ziling. They could accept that the Azure Storm Saint Lord picked Jiang Cheng. After all, Jiang Cheng was a genius from an Ancient Saint Clan, but why Ye Ziling? They were naturally unhappy about this.

With that, only two quotas were left for them to be taken in as a disciple of the saints. The surrounding atmosphere suddenly became weird as everyone’s gazes fell onto Lin Yun, Ye Ziyun, Chen Bing, Huang Yancheng, and Xiahou Yan. This meant that half of them would be eliminated.

‘“Why did no one pick Xiahou Yan?”

“Lin Yun wasn’t picked, either. This is weird…”

“Chen Bing, Huang Yancheng, and Ye Ziyun are also geniuses on the Elysium Core Ranking.”

“This is really weird…” Murmurs resounded from the surroundings that made Jue Chen frown his brows. But he didn’t give any explanations.

“Sword Fanatic Zhao Yan, are you willing to take me as your master?” The Heavenly Heart Saint Lord of the Golden Firmament Peak smiled. “I have been observing you since the first stage.”

The Heavenly Heart Saint Lord’s words rumbled in the minds of everyone there. This made everyone’s faces change. They couldn’t believe what they had just heard; there was only one quota left. So Xiahou Yan or Lin Yun had to be eliminated.

Xiahou Yan had waves bellowing in his heart, but he still managed to maintain his composure. Meanwhile, the faces of Chen Bing and Huang Yancheng had turned pale. They didn’t think that they were weaker than Xiahou Yan and Lin Yun, but they weren’t confident that they could get the last quota with the two of them around. So did that mean that they would be eliminated?

Huang Yancheng and Chen Bing’s faces were ugly, and they hadn’t recovered from the shock.

“Zhao Yan, why are you standing there so blankly?” Lin Yun pushed Zhao Yan with a smile on his face. If he was a saint, he would also pick Zhao Yan. This was someone who loved the sword from the bottom of his heart, even if he had to give his life for it. This was also the reason why he was called a Sword Fanatic.

“Disciple Zhao Yan greets Master!” Zhao Yan stepped forth after he recovered from his shock.

Only the Scarlet Sun Saint Lord of the Scarlet Firmament Peak hadn’t said a word amongst the six saints. Xiahou Yan believed that the Scarlet Sun Saint Lord would make the right decision. After all, he possessed the Innate Sword Physique, Innate Sword Heart, and Firmament Sword Intent that even Dragon Pulse Realm experts couldn’t grasp.

As the leader of all swordsmen amongst the younger generation of the Ancient Barren Domain, Xiahou Yan naturally had confidence that no one could compete with him. Not even Lin Yun!

“Ye Ziyun, are you willing to take me as your master?” The Scarlet Sun Saint Lord finally spoke, and his words left everyone dumbfounded.

Xiahou Yan’s face became dark as his smile froze on his face. He couldn’t believe that no saint would pick him. After all, he was Xiahou Yan, he who wanted to become the disciple of the Radiant Sword Saint. So Xiahou Yan nearly fainted when he wasn’t chosen by any saint and even wondered if he misheard it.
