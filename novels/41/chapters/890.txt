Chapter 891 - Flamefeather Mountain Range

It was impressive to grasp spiritual sword intent before reaching the first soul Heavenly Soul Realm. Qin Feng also wasn’t being courteous when he said that Liu Yun wasn’t any weaker than him because Lin Yun knew how strong the spiritual sword intent was.

But it had just been half a month and he probably hadn’t reached lesser mastery. So for Liu Yun to act with such flamboyance and dominance, his attitude must be poor.

“This is Lin Yun. I bet all of you have heard of him by now. He is the one who killed Feng Xuan. What you guys probably don’t know is that Feng Xuan didn’t even manage to injure him. He easily took Feng Xuan’s life in ten moves,” smiled Qin Feng because he also didn’t want everyone to look down on Lin Yun. After all, he was the one who found Lin Yun and Lin Yun was also his pawn to stand on even footing with the Highcloud Realm.

Since Highcloud Realm had two first soul Heavenly Soul Realms along with a genius grasping spiritual sword intent, they were probably the strongest force in Thunderflame City.

“You grasped the spiritual sword intent and still needed ten moves to kill a piece of trash like Feng Xuan. You don’t seem that impressive after all,” said Liu Yun with a light flashing through his pupils.

Lin Yun looked at Liu Yun with a playful smile. In the end, Liu Yun was still too young.

Killing Feng Xuan within ten moves? Chen Xuan of the Highcloud Realm was briefly surprised before he smiled, “Liu Yun, killing Feng Xuan before reaching the Heavenly Soul Realm isn’t as easy as you think.”

Chen Xuan should be the strongest among them and had reached the pinnacle first soul Heavenly Soul Realm. The aura he was giving off was even stronger than Qin Feng and even showed signs of reaching the second tribulation.

Qin Feng smiled, “There’s naturally no doubt about Lin Yun’s strength. He definitely has the qualification to come with us. This trip will be dangerous and we have to work together.”

“So, Brother Qin, can you tell us where the Glorysun Spirit will be born now?” Lin Yun asked. He wasn’t even bothered by Liu Yun’s provocation. His words also instantly drew everyone’s attention.

“Definitely. It’s no longer a secret.” Qin Feng nodded his head. “The Glorysun Spirit will emerge in Flamefeather City deep in the Flamefeather Mountain Range. It’s an abandoned dragon city because the statue has already collapsed. The mountain range alone will be a dangerous trip.

“I heard that the Flamefeather City’s City Lord was extremely strong back in the day and that the Glorysun Spirit can be found in his manor. But the scale of Flamefeather City is ten times bigger than our Thunderflame City. Furthermore, the city is enveloped with a demonic aura and demonic beasts can be found everywhere. It won’t be simple to find something in the City Lord’s manor.

“It was a group from an intermediate realm who discovered the abandoned city and discovered the phenomenon of Glorysun Spirit’s birth. But the person who discovered the city died and only a first soul Heavenly Soul Realm expert managed to escape. But he soon died of fire poison shortly after.”

Flamefeather City was truly weird since a first soul Heavenly Soul Realm was poisoned to death. Qin Feng wore a grave expression and continued, “I have to give you guys a disclaimer. We can only stay there for fifteen days to a month at most. Otherwise, even a second soul Heavenly Soul Realm genius will be killed by the poison.

“The city itself is already dangerous, not to mention the Glorysun Spirit’s emergence. The entire Glorysun Land has been shaken with thousands of intermediate realms rushing over. It’ll be a brutal competition and all of you have to be mentally prepared for it.”

Although they had some conflicts with the surrounding Dragon Cities when searching the ruins, they were pretty mild conflicts. Everyone knew that the upcoming battles would be far more brutal than what Qin Feng was saying.

Everyone rested briefly before they moved out. The group had four first soul Heavenly Soul Realm experts and ten geniuses with tribulation qualifications. It was a huge formation that was composed of all the geniuses within Thunderflame City.

Everyone decided to work as a team because the journey was sure to be difficult if they were alone. If they joined forces with the other cities, there was no doubt that they would definitely suffer a huge loss. After all, those with the courage to head to the Flamefeather city weren’t pushovers.

Furthermore, they might even run into those from other astral lands. There were also infamous figures in the Azure Dragon Region who acted like wandering cultivators and hunted the weak. If they knew that the Glorysun Spirit was emerging, there was a high possibility that they would also gather. When the group walked through the streets of Thunderflame City, everyone stared at them.

“I knew it. They also know about the Glorysun Spirit.”

“That’s Lin Yun, right? The one who killed Feng Xuan?”

“That’s him. He’s extremely strong. He killed Feng Xuan as soon as he arrived in Thunderflame City.”

“Want to follow them and see what they’re doing?”

“Are you courting death? Do you think you’re stronger than Feng Xuan? You probably don’t even have the qualification to be cannon fodder for them.” The group naturally attracted everyone’s attention and most gazes were on Lin Yun. After all, Lin Yun’s fame had grown frantically after he killed Feng Xuan.

Lin Yun was somewhat surprised because he never expected that killing Feng Xuan would garner him so much fame. Meanwhile, Liu Yun was full of unhappiness.

His fame had spread when he grasped the spiritual sword intent half a month ago, especially when he hadn’t even reached the first soul Heavenly Soul Realm. But Lin Yun’s appearance had stolen all his thunder since Lin Yun grasped spiritual sword intent while in the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm.

“Junior Brother Liu, don’t take it to heart. He must have a poor foundation since he’s still in the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm. He definitely doesn’t have a greater fortune martial technique and there’s no way he can compare to you.”

“That’s right. After you go through your tribulation, your fame will soar. The name of our Highcloud Realm will spread on this trip to the Flamefeather City!”

“How can the Profound Amber Realm’s foundation be compared to our Highcloud Realm? Junior brother, you don’t have to compare yourself to him.” Those from the Highcloud Realm came forward to comfort Liu Yun.

When Qin Feng saw this scene, he sighed inwardly. These people didn’t know that Lin Yun’s spiritual sword intent wasn’t only in lesser mastery but it was in greater mastery. Even he felt a chill down his spine when he saw how Lin Yun killed Feng Xuan.

Qin Feng peeked at Lin Yun and felt relieved that Lin Yun wasn’t reacting. After all, if Lin Yun became enraged, the Highcloud Realm might not be able to stop him.

Half a day later, the group came to the border of Flamefeather Mountain Range. It was filled with people who were aiming for the Glroysun Spirit. Based on the size of the mountain range, the Flamefeather Mountain Range was the biggest mountain range in Glorysun Land.

It was full of activity and they hadn’t even reached Flamefeather City yet. Many people were hunting demonic beasts and there was no lack of geniuses who lost their lives while hunting. But the demonic beasts at the border of the mountain range naturally wouldn’t be able to pose any threat to their group. Just the Heavenly Soul Realm geniuses with tribulation qualifications led by Liu Yun was enough to deal with the demonic beasts.

They were all excited to hunt the demonic beasts especially since they could obtain beast cores. Lin Yun wasn’t interested in the beast cores though. His only interest was in the Gold Flowlight Lamp. After all, he wanted his Flower Burial Sword to reach the height of a dao artifact.

The Indigoflame Thunderwhip might be a top-tier dao artifact, but he couldn't control it perfectly as he wished. Furthermore, he would definitely poke a beehive if he brought it out. Even the likes of Qin Feng might not be able to hold back their greed if they saw it.

The sky was enveloped with demonic clouds. As they travelled deeper into the mountain range, the demonic beasts became stronger. The first soul Heavenly Soul Realms even had to help out a few times.

This had widened Lin Yun’s experience because this was the first time he witnessed a first soul Heavenly Soul Realm expert fighting. These people had gone through the tribulation, so their physique wasn’t any weaker than his Azure Dragon Enneaform, not to mention that they could use origin energy from their violet palace and aura ocean.CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Many strong demonic beasts were instantly killed by them. With that, Lin Yun had a rough gauge of their strength. Those who had gone through the tribulation and those who hadn’t were at two completely different levels. He was only at the pinnacle quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm. If he didn’t cultivate two sword sutras at the same time and immortal sword intent, he might be defeated in a single attack.

Fortunately, I have already grasped the Three Heavenly Divides. Plus, my sword intent might make a breakthrough to the sky sword intent at any moment. Lin Yun made his analysis while observing the fights.

Five days later, the demonic beasts became so strong that the first soul Heavenly Soul Realm experts had to frequently help out. So much so that they frequently had to work together.

“We’re approaching Flamefeather city. Let’s rest for now,” said Qin Feng. Since coming closer to the city, they hadn’t rested. So the first soul Heavenly Soul Realm experts were exhausted.

An hour later, Liu Yun and the others went to hunt demonic beasts. Clearly, they had tasted the sweetness of hunting demonic beasts earlier. After all, they would enter the depth of Flamefeather Mountain Range at night since they wouldn’t have any more chances to hunt demonic beasts. However, the depths of the mountain range were so dangerous that no one dared to wander on their own.

Chen Xuan agreed to Liu Yun’s request without any hesitation but he forbids everyone from straying far. His only request was that they had to hunt nearby demonic beasts.

It looks like Chen Xuan also had some thoughts of tempering Liu Yun before entering Flamefeather City.

“Brother Lin, you don’t seem to be fond of hunting demonic beasts. The demonic beasts here are corroded with demonic aura, and hunting them can temper your strength,” said Chen Xuan after Liu Yun and the others left.

“Not interested,” said Lin Yun as he played with Lil’ Red. Hunting demonic beasts might be a decent opportunity to temper himself, but it was a pity that the demonic beasts here were too weak. This was why Lin Yun had no interest in hunting them.

Chen Xuan smiled and maintained silence. He initially didn’t place Lin Yun in his eyes. But after knowing that Lin Yun killed Feng Xuan within ten moves, his interest was piqued. Lin Yun must be lacking in resources to make a breakthrough because of the poor foundation of Profound Amber Realm. So it would be great if he could recruit Lin Yun over to their group.
