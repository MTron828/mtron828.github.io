Chapter 976 - I'm Not Alone!

Every single one of the seven heads had incredible strength and their names shined brightly on the Heavenly Path Mirror. But so far, Lin Yun had only met Luo Chen, Qin Lin, and Jun Mengchen.

He could tell from his conversation with Luo Chen that the seven heads were divided into two factions. Luo Chen, Qin Lin, and Jun Mengchen were in one faction while the other four belonged to the other one. The first faction showed goodwill to him, especially since Luo Chen lowered his status to befriend him. But the feeling that Feng Xuanyi gave him was completely different. He felt like a dangerous person, especially since he had seven corpses in front of him.

Looking at the eight paintings hovering behind Feng Xuanyi, the corpses on the ground, and the ancient mat, Lin Yun figured out what was going on. The seven victims must have also had paintings that contained part of the Golden Crow. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have come to this valley. It looked like Feng Xuanyi killed them for their paintings.

Moreover, Lin Yun could tell that Feng Xuanyi only used one attack to kill them. Clearly, the seven heads were a lot stronger than the other geniuses on the Azure Dragon Ranking.

Looking at Feng Xuanyi again, Lin Yun’s expression became grave because he never expected that he would run into one of the seven heads. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Don’t worry. I didn’t attack you because I recognize you. You’re Flower Burial Lin Yun, right? I heard about you from Qin Lin, Jun Mengchen, and Luo Chen. They seem to pay great importance to you,” smiled Feng Xuanyi.

“You’re being too polite,” replied Lin Yun. Although he wore a grave expression, he wasn’t afraid of Feng Xuanyi. Feng Xuanyi might be a lot stronger than the likes of Shi Xuan, but Lin Yun was also prepared to face the seven heads.

Feng Xuanyi squinted his eyes because he knew what Lin Yun meant. It didn’t seem like Lin Yun was bothered by his identity, especially since Lin Yun wasn’t handing over the painting as he expected. Standing up, Feng Xuanyi turned around and looked at the massive statue deep in the valley, “Lin Yun, do you know what this statue represents?”

“I don’t.” Lin Yun was also pretty curious about the statue. When his Divine Glorysun Fist reached the monarch fortune martial technique, the winged human phenomenon he manifested was similar to the statue.

“That is the Golden Crow Divine Ancestor. The Glorysun Constellation Palace’s inheritance was related to the Golden Crow Dao. You don’t comprehend flame intent, so this inheritance doesn’t matter to you. All I’m lacking right now is your painting. I need it to open the inheritance and if you give it to me, I can consider it as half a favor.” Feng Xuanyi turned around and continued, “Half a favor, consider it my respect to you.”

After hearing what Feng Xuanyi had to say, Lin Yun replied calmly “If you’re willing to offer the eight paintings to me, I can owe you a favor. Consider it my respect to you as well.”

Although he didn’t need the Golden Crow Dao, he needed the inheritance to make a breakthrough in his advanced martial techniques. There was no way he could give up on them. Feng Xuanyi might be strong, but there was no way Lin Yun could be forced to submit with just a few words.

“It looks like you still have no idea of your current situation or how these people died…” Feng Xuanyi’s face was indifferent as he spoke. “I’ll just have to help myself to the painting. Too bad, I really wanted to give you half a favor because of Luo Chen.”

When he finished, Feng Xuanyi spread his hands apart with flames appearing behind him. The flames shined like the bright sun as golden brilliance enveloped the entire valley. Then, flaming crows flew out of the flames and filled the entire sky.

“My flame intent isn’t any weaker than your sword intent. Take a palm from me first. If you can’t even take a palm from me, then this is meaningless!” Feng Xuanyi’s eyes flashed coldly as he charged towards Lin Yun in the blink of an eye.

“Solar Shattering Fist!” Feng Xuanyi roared as his origin energy formed a dazzling sun that swept towards Lin Yun. The power behind this palm was terrifying and caused a huge commotion. All the geniuses within a hundred miles radius could see the commotion and instantly recognized Feng Xuanyi’s attack.

It was Feng Xuanyi’s famous attack. After all, no one in the same realm could take this palm head-on. They would either be heavily injured or die.

Looking at the massive sun hanging in the sky, Lin Yun’s face became grave. He circulated his sword sutras and gathered all of his origin energy into his palm. At the same time, his heart throbbed as he activated the Azure Dragon Battle Physique. With the black azure dragon breath appearing on his palm, a terrifying dragon aura instantly swept out from Lin Yun’s body.

“Azure Dragon Incinerating Palm!” Lin Yun fused his origin energy, brute strength, dragon breath, and azure dragon sword aura into this strike. After reaching the second soul Heavenly Soul Realm, Lin Yun had never exhausted this much energy into his fortune martial technique. The Azure Dragon Incinerating Palm didn’t let him down.

A gigantic dragon claw stretched out from the black flames and flew towards Feng Xuanyi’s attack like a sharp sword. When the dragon claw and sun collided, a violent energy swept out and caused a series of explosions in the surrounding mountain range and forest.

“Lin Yun is facing Feng Xuanyi!” Many people instantly recognized the dragon claw because Lin Yun had used it before.

Lin Yun and Feng Xuanyi retreated after their brief clash. Although they were fighting in the remote valley, they drew the attention of everyone on the island. Surprisingly, Lin Yun didn’t suffer much of a loss.

“Liu Mu, Shi Xuan, and Song Rui. Now, he’s facing Feng Xuanyi. Lin Yun is fearless.”

“They’re probably fighting for the Glorysun Constellation Palace’s inheritance. Lin Yun really kicked an iron plate this time…”

Everyone was filled with shock when they looked at Lin Yun. As an underdog from the lower realms, Lin Yun’s journey inspired many people.

“Your attack doesn’t seem so terrifying after all.” Lin Yun grinned as he wiped the flood off his mouth. Then, he blanched at Feng Xuanyi again with blazing fighting spirits in his pupils.

“This is just the beginning.” Feng Xuanyi’s gaze grew even colder as his tone was filled with killing intent. When he finished speaking, his birds descended with immense pressure. Clenching his fist, the flaming birds started to fly in a circle like a golden halo of flames. “Die!”

Lin Yun’s face changed because he never expected Feng Xuanyi’s flame intent to be so powerful. With a single thought, the Azure Firmament Tree appeared behind him adorned with Iris Flowers. He was pushing his sword aura to the limit to resist Feng Xuanyi’s flame intent.

But even so, Lin Yun felt the disadvantage in his cultivation. He still managed to exchange dozens of moves with Feng Xuanyi as he did his best to hold on.

Who would have thought that Lin Yun could cause such a commotion? The rumbling explosions were enough to make the crowd’s organs tumble.

Suddenly, a massive demonic ape joined the fight as it swung its golden staff. When the staff came crashing down, the immense pressure caused the sky to tremble and space to distort. Feng Xuanyi’s face changed drastically because the staff was directed at him. At the same time, a black cat began to expand in his eyes.
