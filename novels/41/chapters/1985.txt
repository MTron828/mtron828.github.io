Chapter 1986 - Stop Pretending

Bai Shuying left? This news was so sudden for Lin Yun that it made him feel at a loss, as though he had lost something. He said many things to Bai Shuying in the past because he had to maintain his disguise as Ye Qingtian. It was like a game, and he was pretending to be someone else; he didn’t have to pay any price.

But now, Lin Yun was shocked to discover that Bai Shuying had always maintained her calm. She was polite and kept her distance. Even when she revealed her murderous intent multiple times, she ultimately endured it. She maintained her composure whenever he faced her, and now that Lin Yun thought about it, he felt a little ashamed when he faced Bai Shuying.

Bai Shuying was straightforward whenever she interacted with him. When he revealed his talent, she hoped he had changed and wouldn’t waste his talent. When she saw him with Wang Muyan, she warned him not to get too close to the latter, which proved correct.

As the saying goes, a gentleman had nothing to hide. Bai Shuying was honest with him, but he always had a mask, even if he seemed cocky. He didn’t even dare to reveal his true appearance; he was like a clown right from the start. It turned out that he was the one who fell too deep in his acting.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Ye Qingtian, don’t be sad,” Wang Yue sighed. He didn’t know how to comfort Ye Qingtian.

“I’m not sad,” Lin Yun replied.

“You still have to pretend in front of me?” Wang Yue revealed an expression as though he understood Ye Qingtian well.

Lin Yun couldn’t help turning to look at Wang Yue in surprise.

“I naturally know you well,” Wang Yue replied as though he knew what Ye Qingtian was thinking. He continued, “I have already told you at Remorse Cliff that only I know you the best in the world. But nothing good comes if it’s forced. So don’t dwell on it too much.”

Lin Yun couldn’t help smiling when he heard that.

“Still pretending?” Wang Yue sneered. “Did you fail in your confession three days ago?”

“What confession?” Lin Yun asked.

Wang Yue glanced at Lin Yun and continued, “Do you want me to tell you everything?”

Wang Yue already had his speculation when Bai Shuying called out to Ye Qingtian, and Ye Qingtian had probably confessed to Bai Shuying. But he was probably ruthlessly rejected by her.

After that, Bai Shuying became honest with the elders of her clan that she was already at the Quasi-Saint Realm, and she used this opportunity to temporarily leave the Heavenly Dao Sect.

When Lin Yun heard what Wang Yue said, he couldn’t help feeling speechless.

“Love has been complicated since ancient times. Don’t dwell on it too much. Everyone thinks you’re a scumbag, but I know you’re not,” Wang Yue sighed.

The corner of Lin Yun’s lips twitched when he heard that. He really wanted to tell Wang Yue that he knew nothing about him.

“Who could’ve thought that the holy maiden’s heart already belonged to someone? If I had known about that, I wouldn’t have persuaded you to leave Remorse Cliff. This is all my fault,” Wang Yue suddenly said, which shocked Lin Yun just because he wanted to refute Wang Yue’s words.

“Who told you about that?” Lin Yun asked suspiciously.

“Everyone already knows about it. Bai Shuying was honest to the Bai Clan’s elders that she already had someone she liked, and she had been waiting for him in the Heavenly Dao Sect, which was why she didn’t leave after reaching the Quasi-Saint Realm,” Wang Yue said.

“One has to leave the sect after reaching the Quasi-Saint Realm?” Lin Yun asked in bafflement.

“The Quasi-Saint Realm is a step onto the saint path, and the benefits of staying in the sect aren’t high,” Wang Yue said. “There’s also an unspoken rule in the Heavenly Dao Sect. Once a saint disciple reaches the Quasi-Saint Realm, he or she will have to leave the sect and kill a demonic cultivator that’s at the Quasi-Saint Realm. This might be an unspoken rule, but everyone has been following it. This is why it is rare to see saint disciples who are at the Quasi-Saint Realm in the sect.”

Lin Yun finally understood what Wang Yue meant through his explanation. He asked, “Who’s that person?”

He already knew Bai Shuying had someone she liked, but she never told him about who it was. So he was pretty curious about who this person was.

“She didn’t say who it was,” Wang Yue said furiously. “That man must be a scumbag, using tricks to fool the holy maiden and even said to meet in the Heavenly Dao Sect. In the end, he never came!”

Lin Yun was briefly stunned and looked a little dazed.

“I actually don’t believe it either, but the holy maiden admitted it, personally. She said they already consummated their marriage and hoped that her clan wouldn’t arrange any marriage for her,” Wang Yue sighed.

“Isn’t that the same as falling out with the Bai Clan?” Lin Yun asked.

“It’s not that simple. This is equivalent to breaking away from the Bai Clan entirely. But it was lucky that the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint showed up, or it would’ve been tough to clean the matter up,” Wang Yue nodded.

“Why did she have to take it so far…?” Lin Yun sighed.

“Stop sighing. The Bai Clan blames you for it, and I heard her younger sister wants to take your life,” Wang Yue smiled.

“What does it have to do with me? I’m not the person she’s waiting for. Isn’t her younger sister a little too domineering?” Lin Yun asked curiously.

“That might be the case, but what’s reasonable? They didn’t know who took the holy maiden’s virginity, and they couldn’t afford to provoke the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint. So they naturally chose to take it out on you,” Wang Yue sighed. “Furthermore, the Bai Clan wouldn’t have lost a holy maiden if you hadn’t chased Nie Wushuang away.”

Lin Yun didn’t want to say anything more, but this was ridiculous. He picked up his teacup and took a sip, but there was another meaning in this, sending his guest off.

But Wang Yue pretended not to see the hidden meaning and continued to chat with Ye Qingtian about other matters. Such as, the four strongest swordsmen of the Heavenly Dao Sect had returned, and a few were actually at the ninth transformation of the Nirvana Stage. The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint had accepted them as her outer disciples and privately taught them sword techniques.

He blabbered about why the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint did all this and how there must be a hidden reason why the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint was so concerned about this Sword Assembly.

“I heard that the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint wanted to get something from the Hidden Sword Manor,” Wang Yue said, looking at Lin Yun’s face.

“What does it have to do with me? I won’t go to this Sword Assembly; you can just say what you want. Stop beating around the bush.” Lin Yun said.

Wang Yue awkwardly smiled, “Actually, there’s more than one holy maiden in the Heavenly Dao Sect. Since the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden has left, isn’t there another holy maiden? Coincidentally, you happen to know this holy maiden as well.”

“You talking about Wang Muyan?” Lin Yun asked, raising his head.

“That’s right. She’s actually from the same clan as me. She might not have a good reputation, but she’s a peerless beauty,” Wang Yue smiled.

Rather than a peerless beauty, she is more like a femme fatale. Lin Yun inwardly muttered.
