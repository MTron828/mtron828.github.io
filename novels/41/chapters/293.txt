Chapter 294 - Refining

Everyone looked at Lin Yun with a complicated gaze. None of them were willing to have the Imperial Sword Herb taken by Lin Yun. After all, it wasn’t easy for them to come here and they even had companions who died. But the strength exhibited by Lin Yun was too shocking, so no one dared to take the lead to stop him. So despite how reluctant they felt, they had to bear with it.

As for Lin Yun, he naturally had no reason to stay since he already obtained the Imperial Sword Herb.

“Disciples of the Fire Alliance listen up! Stop Zhong Yunxiao! Don’t let him leave!” A bark echoed out from the forest while everyone was frozen still. It came from Xiao Feng.

After being injured by Lin Yun, Xiao Feng was extremely unwilling to see Lin Yun leave with the Imperial Sword Herb. He wanted to rile everyone up into attacking Lin Yun. His roar succeeded as everyone looked at Lin Yun with greed in their eyes.

However, Gu Feiyun, Han Feng, and the other leaders looked at Xiao Feng in shock. They wondered if he was insane. They didn’t dare to move despite their own greedy thoughts because they would lose their chance to obtain the Imperial Sword Herb if they got everyone to besiege Lin Yun.

“Damn it. It’s him again!” Lin Yan gnashed her teeth out of loathing for Xiao Feng. Even though Lin Yun had spared him, he was still trying to cause trouble.

As for Lin Yun, he was smiling beneath the mask. Things were becoming interesting. He executed the Seven Profound Steps, Golden Crow Wings. He infused his origin energy into the Golden Crow Seal behind him. Then, he spread his arms apart and soared into the sky. Under countless shocked gazes, Lin Yun charged at Xiao Feng and threw out a punch that contained dracophant energy.

“No!” Xiao Feng’s face was drained of all color. There was no way he could handle this attack.

Lin Yun’s punch glided like a sword as it broke through the air resistance and slammed into Xiao Feng’s chest, creating a huge hole and claiming his life.

“This…”

“Xiao Feng died just like that?”

“That’s the Seven Profound Steps! He actually formed the Golden Crow Seal!”

Gu Feiyun and the others who had their own thoughts were trembling in fear. The fear spread through their hearts to the point where they didn’t dare to look at Lin Yun. They no longer had any thoughts for the Imperial Sword Herb.

At the same time, the disciples on the island were all trembling with fear. Everything happened too quickly and Xiao Feng was killed in the blink of an eye. This outcome had caught everyone by surprise. Although Lin Yun’s strength had shocked them previously, he hadn’t killed anyone, which gave them hope for survival. But his ruthlessness was like a buzzing slap to the face.

“Senior Brother Zhong, we have no intention of going against you. It was all because of Xiao Feng’s instigation...”

“Senior Brother Zhong, please don’t misunderstand us.” The Fire Alliance’s disciples all got on their knees begging for mercy.

Lin Yun then looked at Wei Songhan. Wei Songhan immediately became vigilant as sweat dripped from his back. He instantly knew what Lin Yun’s gaze meant. He had been one step behind. If he hadn’t been slow, then he would also be dead like Xiao Feng.

“Even ants want to live, but it’s a pity that some people overestimated themselves. Just because I didn’t kill you guys doesn’t mean I’m not capable of doing it. It’s just that it feels no different from squashing ants.” Lin Yun snorted and turned around to leave. Everyone in the surrounding immediately opened a path with revere in their eyes.

“Zhong Yunxiao is definitely comparable to those on the top ten on the Mortal Ranking!” Gu Feiyun looked at Lin Yun’s figure and gnashed his teeth, “He’s a true monster. Since when has there been someone like him in the outer sect?”

With the example of Xiao Feng, no one dared to have any ideas on Lin Yun anymore. A moment later, Lin Yun took out the Imperial Sword Herb. The herb was emitting spiritual energy, which made everyone feel relaxed.

“This is the Imperial Sword Herb? Even without the sword intent, it can be considered a treasure.” Chen Ling stared at the Imperial Sword Herb and felt like he was dreaming. Lin Qiushan and Gu Beixuan were also looking at the herb with complicated emotions. They couldn’t believe that Lin Yun would share something like this with them. “Indeed, this is worth all the trouble,” said Lin Yun.

Lin Yun held onto the Imperial Sword Herb and started to pluck the leaves before distributing them.

“Thank you, Senior Brother Zhong.”

“I’m really ashamed that I couldn’t help Brother Zhong. In fact, we even have to trouble Brother Zhong to share the Imperial Sword Herb with us.”

“Brother Zhong, I, Lin Qiushan, owe you one.”

Lin Qiushan, Gu Beixuan, and Chen Ling expressed their gratitude, especially Lin Qiushan. Her words were sincere when she looked at Lin Yun.

“Who can refuse a favor from the Great Qin Empire’s Lin Clan?” smiled Lin Yun.

Lin Qiushan also smiled upon hearing that. She knew that Zhong Yunxiao was only being courteous. Based on what she observed so far about Zhong Yunxiao, she knew that he was a loner who didn’t care about her identity as a descendant from the Lin Clan.

Lin Yan, on the other hand, wasn’t too bothered with the Imperial Sword Herb. She smiled, “Big Brother Zhong, are you joining us for the second round?”

“That’s not a good idea. I’m afraid that I will only bring you guys trouble.” It would be hard since Lin Yun didn’t want to reveal his identity, especially because he would be facing the top ten on the Mortal Ranking. All of them had their own trump cards, so he would be gravely injured if he was careless.

He couldn’t underestimate any of them, especially those on to the top three. Lin Yun wasn’t afraid of the challenge and would just deal with whatever came his way.

“Oh.” Lin Yan looked disappointed. She then whispered, “Big Brother Zhong, you have to pay the Lin Clan a visit when you go to the capital next time. I’ll welcome you with my big sister.” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Sure. I’ll do so when I’m free,” smiled Lin Yun. He waved his hand and left the party.

After he left, Lin Yan then turned to look at Lin Qiushan with reluctance, “Big Sister, do you think he will really pay us a visit?”

“What are you thinking? Have you fallen for him? Don’t forget that you don’t even know what he looks like,” smiled Lin Qiushan.

“That’s right. He must be ugly since he’s covering his face with a mask,” said Tian Fei.

Upon hearing that, Lin Yan became unhappy. She frowned and harrumphed, “So what if he’s wearing a mask? You’re the ugly one. Your whole family is ugly!”

Chen Ling burst out in laughter. He felt fortunate that he wasn’t the one being dissed. As for Tian Fei, he was asking to be humiliated. Lin Yun had just shared the Imperial Sword Herb with them, yet Tian Fei started talking bad about him as soon as he was gone. Tian Fei totally deserved to be scolded.

Tian Fei’s face turned red and he felt depressed. That wasn’t what Lin Yan said earlier!

“Let’s leave this place first. No one knows what we will face on our way to the Sword Tomb, so we can’t afford to be careless,” said Lin Qiushan.

“Yeah. We can tell from the fight for the Imperial Sword Herb that the Alliance-Union Battle will probably get out of control this time.”

“The sect is being serious this time.

After separating from Lin Qiushan’s party, Lin Yun found a place to pause at and made sure no one was in the surrounding. Most of the Imperial Sword Herb’s essence was located in the stem, so it didn’t matter too much for him that he shared the leaves.

Lin Yun waved his hand and took out the five Swordcloud Cores. The Imperial Sword Herb and Swordcloud Cores could combine perfectly together and their effects would even amplify.

“My Iris Sword Sutra should reach the eighth stage after refining this and I’ll probably be able to form the fifth profound vein very smoothly.” At that time, he would resolve the grudges against him. The Gentlemen Union issued a bounty on him and he would’ve already attacked them if he wasn’t composed. After all, no one wanted to be hunted.

Lin Yun made up his mind to give the Gentlemen Union and those in the top ten on the Mortal Ranking a surprise in the second round.
