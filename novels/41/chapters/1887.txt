Chapter 1888 - Heavenly Dao Sacred Flame

Lin Yun shocked everyone with his performance, and even Bai Shuying’s face changed. As for those newly conferred saint disciples, they were long dumbfounded and wondered if Lin Yun was still a human.

Everyone had just entered the Profound Death Stage, and yet Lin Yun had shaken them away with his Heavenly Dome Sword Intent.

Bai Shuying locked her brows together with doubt flashing across her pupils. She couldn’t believe how someone could change so much in just one year, and this was too unbelievable. One year ago, Ye Qingtian was only at the Dragon Pulse Realm. But one year later, he had reached the Profound Death Stage and grasped the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent.

The saint’s disciples of the two palaces and three courtyards were seriously looking at Lin Yun. Within the Heavenly Dao Sect, saint disciples were nothing compared to saint’s disciples. No one within the Heavenly Dao Sect dared to offend the saint’s disciples, not even the Peak Masters.

Saint’s disciples didn’t only represent their potential, but they also represented their masters. Saints had a lot of authority within the Heavenly Dao Sect, which naturally brought endless benefits to the disciples. So every single Heavenly Dao Sect disciple dreamt about becoming a saint’s disciple. The saint’s disciples had shown interest in Lin Yun’s Heavenly Dome Sword Intent.

Chen Jun's face had long turned pale with disbelief in his pupils. He struggled back onto his feet and coldly looked at Lin Yun, “It’s just the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent. Give me half a year, and I can also grasp it.”

“Junior Brother Chen, I must praise you for how shameless you can be. How can you be so arrogant with the Quasi-Heavenly Dome Sword Intent? What’s the matter? My Heavenly Dome Sword Intent cannot be compared to your Quasi-Heavenly Dome Sword Intent?” Lin Yun smiled.

“Hmph!” Chen Jun snorted. But just when he wanted to say something, he threw out another mouthful of blood. It was as though something was triggered because Chen Jun kept throwing out blood and fell onto one knee, clutching his chest. His state was a little pathetic.

On the altar, the Quasi-Saint Peak Masters began to discuss amongst themselves, “That’s the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent. It looks like Ye Qingtian has undergone a thorough transformation.”

“The Indigo Thunder Peak produced a genius swordsman.”

“Congratulations, Indigo Thunder Peak Master!”

They were surprised and weren’t trying to flatter the Indigo Thunder Peak’s Peak Master because they didn’t have any grudges. If Ye Qingtian could change, it would be good news for the Heavenly Dao Sect.

“Indigo Thunder Peak Master, I remember that he hasn’t taken a master, right?” Saint Elder turned to look at the Indigo Thunder Peak Master.

When the Indigo Thunder Peak Master heard that, he wore an awkward expression and explained, “He did have a master in the past, but he was kicked out…”

Nodding his head, Saint Elder said, “Great. A few saint elders intend to take in disciples recently, so ask him for his opinion. I’m also optimistic about him.”

The surrounding Quasi-Saints were shocked upon hearing that. Ye Qingtian had just become a saint disciple and would become a saint’s disciple now. Furthermore, judging from his tone, anyone could tell that Saint Elder was interested in Ye Qingtian.

They had no idea what was going on because Ye Qingtian said he wanted to beat up Saint Elder in the future.

The Indigo Thunder Peak Master rejoiced upon hearing that, and he smiled, “Okay. I’ll ask him about it when I go back.”

“Saint Elder, you can’t do that. His reputation is notorious within the sect, not to mention what he did a year ago. Furthermore, he has no sense of regret, judging from his tone, and no one can ensure it won’t happen again.” Someone spoke out.

“Anyone can change. I looked through the reports last night, and they were all small matters in general. As for what happened a year ago, no need to mention it since the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint is no longer pursuing it,” said the Saint Elder.

“But he didn’t show any talent as a swordsman in the past, so it’s hard to ensure that he’ll keep up with his pace.”

“It doesn’t matter. I trust in my eyesight. In the sect’s history, there were similar incidents. I remember there was a Sword Saint who didn’t even grasp the Firmament Sword Intent at the age of forty, but he suddenly rose upon enlightenment,” said the Saint Elder.

They naturally isolated their conversation from the outside world so no one had heard it. Lin Yun also didn’t know that he caught the Saint Elder’s attention and would soon become a saint’s disciple.

“Indigo Thunder Peak Master, you have to hurry up on that because his talent cannot be wasted,” said the Saint Elder.

“I understand,” the Indigo Thunder Peak Master smiled.Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Seeing that Saint Elder was determined, the other Quasi-Saints said nothing.

At the altar, no one said anything after Lin Yun’s question. It wasn’t because there weren’t any geniuses amongst the newly conferred saint disciples, but that they were mainly on the same level as Chen Jun. Even if some was stronger than Chen Jun, they weren’t much stronger. Thus, they weren’t confident about winning against Ye Qingtian.

As for the other saint disciples, they didn’t have the guts, even if they wanted to.

“Ye Qingtian!” The Saint Elder roared.

“I’m here,” Lin Yun replied.

“Put this matter to a stop now. If you mention it again, I’ll beat you until you’re convinced,” the Saint Elder said coldly.

“Well, I naturally have nothing else to say since you put it that way,” Lin Yun replied lazily.

This made the Indigo Thunder Peak Master anxious, fearing that Saint Elder might change his mind about taking Lin Yun in as a disciple.

Saint Elder ignored what Lin Yun said and continued, “Everyone will have an hour of rest. Send the injured back and let them return once they’ve recovered.”

Anyone could tell that Saint Elder was generous. He didn’t punish Lin Yun nor seize the qualifications of those who lost.

An hour quickly passed, and Saint Elder recited the ceremony again before placing down mats for the newly conferred saint disciples to sit on.

“I will light the Heavenly Dao Sacred Flame for you to comprehend. After receiving the sacred flame’s acknowledgment, you guys will become saint disciples,” said the Saint Elder, and he soared to the sky with the peak masters. They all began to form seals, and an ancient spiritual array soon appeared above everyone. The entire daofield began to tremble with a terrifying aura sweeping out.

“Welcome the Sacred Flame!” The Saint Elder roared with echoes following from the surroundings.

“Welcome the Sacred Flame!”

“Welcome the Sacred Flame!”

Two ancient balls of flames ignited on the Heavenly Dao Altar, one golden and the other silver. They both represented the Heavenly Sword and Dao Sword. The flames manifested into two fishes chasing each other as the flames accumulated. In the end, the warmth and light of the sacred flames enveloped the entire daofield.

Basking in it, Lin Yun felt warmth and peace, accompanied by various majestic scenes appearing before his eyes. Those weren’t illusions but the histories of those who once wielded the sword, including the various legends of the Heavenly Dao Sect.

“Comprehend!” Following the Saint Elder’s word, everyone closed their eyes and began comprehending. This was the crucial part of the ceremony. They had to comprehend to be bestowed with a corresponding sacred flame from the Heavenly Dao Sacred Flame.

The sacred flames came from the remains of the past sword wielders, containing the martial insight of their lifetime, and it was differentiated into six grades. They were the Sage Flame, King Flame, Saint Flame, Saint Sovereign Flame, Great Saint Flame, and the Saint King Flame.

Sage Flame was the bare minimum. It might contain the sword wielders’ cultivation technique, secret technique, or pure energy. Only newly conferred saint disciples were qualified to comprehend it, so everyone naturally cherished this opportunity.

It didn’t take long for someone to open their eyes. They looked disappointed because they were only bestowed with Sage Flame, a speck of white flame that flew out from the golden fish.

“Thank you for the bestow!” The person who was bestowed the Sage Flame felt humiliated and quickly left. Everyone in the surroundings snickered and soon identified the peak that person was from.

“I wonder which grade Senior Brother will receive.” The Indigo Thunder Peak’s disciples were excited and nervous as they waited.

“Senior Sister Miao Yin, which grade do you think Ye Qingtian will receive?” The Profound Maiden Courtyard’s disciples asked. They were already won over by Lin Yun’s performance back at the Nether Orchid Courtyard, not to mention his performance again. Some even felt that Ye Qingtian must’ve worked hard over the past year because of Bai Shuying.

While they were chatting, they nearly praised Ye Qingtian to the heavens.

Ye Xinyan smiled, “He has grasped the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent. According to records, he will obtain a Saint Flame at the very least. There’s a high chance he’ll obtain the Saint Sovereign Flame and a small chance for the Great Saint Flame!”

The eyes of the Profound Maiden Courtyard’s disciples lit up. “Senior Brother Ye is so strong? That’s the Great Saint Flame we’re talking about!”

“I knew that Senior Brother Ye was extraordinary.”

Ye Xinyan smiled, but no longer said a word.

Lin Yun’s popularity amongst the Profound Maiden Courtyard’s disciples naturally made many people unhappy.

“Hmph. How can someone like him possibly obtain anything? He’s only qualified with the Sage Flame.”

“I don’t think he’s even qualified to receive the Sage Flame.”

“That fellow has nothing apart from his looks.”

“That’s right. He has no merits aside from his looks!”

“He’s arrogant and overbearing. He’s still the same as before; he hasn’t changed.” A heated discussion resounded from the surroundings, and everyone chose to attack Lin Yun’s good looks this time after witnessing his strength.
