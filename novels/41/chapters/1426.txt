Chapter 1427 - Is That All You Got?

When Xiahou Yan executed the Great Sun Subduing Palm, none of the elders or disciples of the Sword Saint could remain seated. They knew Xiahou Yan was strong. But they never imagined that he would be this strong. They understood why Xiahou Yan was confident enough to not draw his sword when facing Lin Yun.

“Flower Burial, kneel before me!” Xiahou Yan roared as the Great Sun Saint Rune bloomed as the entire palm descended.

When Lin Yun raised his head to look at the flaming palm, his gaze had become grave. He was surprised by the power of the ghost spirit martial technique, which exceeded his expectations. If he still wasn’t going to draw his sword, it would be somewhat troublesome for him to face it.

Then again, it was only some trouble. What Lin Yun did next surprised everyone. He took a deep breath and stomped his foot on the ground, soaring to the sky just when the flaming palm was about to land.

“This…” Everyone was stunned by what Lin Yun did. That flaming palm was terrifying and even had the Great Sun Saint Rune in it. So wasn’t directly charging at it the same as courting death?

But Lin Yun was too fast. He was so fast that they didn’t even have the time to think. Lin Yun began to form a seal with his hand and the Blood Flame Divine Rune began to blaze on his chest. This caused all the dragon runes on the surface of his body to ignite as he clashed with the flaming palm head-on.

The ignition of the Blood Flame Divine Rune significantly boosted his power, bringing his physique to an unbelievable height. This made Xiahou Yan snort as he made a grab for Lin Yun before they were about to collide.

“You’re just an ant in my eyes. Now, you can die!” Xiahou Yan’s eyes were cold. He had lost control of his emotions when he learned that Lin Yun had become the disciple of the Radiant Sword Saint.

When the flaming palm clenched together, it turned into a blazing fireball that looked like a miniature sun. This made everyone’s faces change with their jaws wide open. Ghost spirit martial techniques were terrifying. So, even if Lin Yun didn’t die in it, he would probably be heavily crippled.

“This ghost spirit martial technique doesn’t seem so impressive after all...” A voice resounded from the fireball. This made everyone’s heart pump. They knew Lin Yun was still alive and had not lost the strength to fight.

Xiahou Yan was surprised before his face changed with murdering intent surging in his pupils.

Just when everyone was wondering what was going on, a dragon roar echoed from the miniature sun as cracks began to spread out, allowing a wave of true dragon aura to seep out. When the dragon's roar echoed, the miniature sun burst like a firework and a purple-golden azure dragon appeared from it with Lin Yun standing on its head.

While standing on the dragon’s head, Lin Yun looked like a deity that was born from the sun. When the dragon aura swept out, the sky turned dark once more and everyone was shocked to discover that Lin Yun came out unscathed under Xiahou Yan’s attack.

“H-How is this possible?!” Xiahou Yan widened his eyes and couldn’t believe what he was seeing.

“Looks like I didn’t drink the Golden Dragon Bone Soup for nothing.” Lin Yun murmured to himself. When he looked at Xiahou Yan, a smile appeared on the corner of his mouth because it was time for them to have some fun.

Reaching out with his index finger, he scraped his nails on his right palm, opening a wound. As blood flowed from the wound, Lin Yun squatted down and slammed his palm on the head of the azure dragon. As he injected his blood into the azure dragon, the azure dragon began to grow and swiftly reached three hundred meters in size.

The thunderclouds had spread over a radius of eight thousand miles with the azure dragon at the center. This made everyone exclaim as they watched the azure dragon charge at Xiahou Yan while emitting a true dragon aura.

This made Xiahou Yan raise his brow. But just when he was about to raise his hand, the azure dragon had already slammed into him and sent him flying away as he let out a groan.

Lin Yun smiled when he saw this scene. Then he stomped his foot on the azure dragon and appeared before Xiahou Yan just as he landed on the ground.

As various phenomena appeared, Lin Yun unleashed the three ultimate moves of the Divine Solar Lunar Fist. Taking the three consecutive blows, Xiahou Yan finally couldn’t take it anymore and threw out a mouthful of blood.

This scene left Xiahou Yun, Bai Zhanli, and others dumbfounded, their jaws nearly dropping off. Everything happened too quickly. Xiahou Yan still held the advantage just a moment ago with his ghost spirit martial techniques. So who could’ve thought that Xiahou Yan would be sent flying away in one breath’s time?

“This punch is to tell you that the Sword Sect cannot be humiliated!” Lin Yun’s face flashed with murderous intent as he stomped his foot on the ground, charging at Xiahou Yan together with the azure dragon. He had no intention of letting Xiahou Yan catch his breath. His fist was like a sword that was being thrust forth.

As Lin Yun threw out more punches, azure birds began to appear, using his fist to execute the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords. This instantly left Xiahou Yan dumbfounded. But since he didn’t have his sword, he could only take a one-sided beating from Lin Yun.

But Lin Yun’s eyes were cold as he threw out his punches. Since Xiahou Yan wanted to act before him by not drawing his sword, Lin Yun would show him who would be the one taking a beating!

Xiahou Yan took ten-odd punches in such a short moment and was soon covered in blood. When Lin Yun was done executing the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords, the thirteen azure birds merged into an azure sword that enveloped Xiahou Yan.

Lin Yun turned around in mid-air and balled his fist together, converging all of his sword aura into his palm. Xiahou Yan tried his best to resist by unleashing dazzling flames from his body. But his resistance was futile. Lin Yun’s punch was radiating brightly.

Taking the punch head-on, Xiahou Yan threw out a mouthful of blood before he was sent flying away. When he landed on the ground, he staggered and took several steps back before he fell to one knee.

When Lin Yun took a deep breath, the azure dragon coiling around him soared to the sky, looking like a real dragon with flesh and blood. This was unbelievable to everyone. Their eyes were wide open, looking at this young man.

A ruthless light flashed across Xiahou Yan’s pupils as he slammed his palm onto the ground. When he got back up, his skin was giving off a radiant jadeite glow. That was the Innate Sword Physique. But that wasn’t all, his heart was starting to pump violently; this was his Innate Sword Heart.

When Xiahou Yan brought out the Innate Sword Physique and Innate Sword Heart once more, the majority of his injuries instantly recovered. This scene left many people dumbfounded.

“Since you want to die, I’ll fulfill your wish today!” Pushing the Innate Sword Physique and Innate Sword Heart to the limit, Xiahou Yan appeared before Lin Yun in the blink of an eye. When he raised his hand and pushed his palm out, a powerful aura swept out from his body, along with a boundless sword aura. Xiahou Yan had resorted to using his firmament sword intent.

This made everyone’s faces change as they subconsciously closed their eyes. Just what kind of monster was Xiahou Yan? Not only did he grasp the Innate Sword Physique and Innate Sword Heart, he even grasped the firmament sword intent. His palm was directed at Lin Yun, trying to knock him to the ground.

“Do you think you’re the only one with the firmament sword intent? Sorry, but I have it, too!” Lin Yun snorted as the two sword souls in his sword ocean were activated. As the two sword souls overlapped, they turned into a boundless sword aura that made Xiahou Yan’s firmament sword intent seem dim in comparison.

Lin Yun countered and slapped Xiahou Yan, causing Xiahou Yan to fall to his knees with his cheek swollen.

“You…!” Xiahou Yan instantly lost it. But just when he wanted to get back up, he took another slap from Lin Yun that sent him flying away.

“This slap is to tell you that the Radiant Sword Saint cannot be humiliated!” Lin Yun roared.
