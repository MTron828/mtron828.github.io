Chapter 824 - Fireflies

So far, no one had luck against the three kings. Jiang Ziye was easily dealt with by Zhao Wuji and Yue Weiwei was miserably defeated by Yu Haotian. However, Fang Hanluo was a little different. Although Lin Yun defeated him even after ten moves, he still surprised many people throughout the banquet. After all, no one made as many breakthroughs in cultivation as he did while fighting.

After losing to Lin Yun, Fang Hanluo was certainly going to come back stronger. No one was sure how he would fare since no one had seen Yan Long’zi’s full strength. His only fight was against Yue Weiwei, who toyed with him because of the pavilion master’s interference. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Since Lin Yun was sitting with the Heavenly Demon Pavilion, he was able to hear how confident they were in Yan Long’zi. Lin Yun was certain that Fang Hanluo still had a few trump cards, so he thought the outcome of the battle was uncertain.

Yan Long’zi looked at Fang Hanluo and smiled sinisterly, “Brat, if you want to participate in the other fights, I advise you to surrender. I’m very unhappy right now and I’m afraid I can’t control my temper!”

“I can sense your rage. I wouldn’t be happy if I were in your position either,” chuckled Fang Hanluo.

When Yan Long’zi heard that, fire blazed in his heart as his face sank. He angrily barked, “Come on then! You can consider it my loss if I don’t cripple you!”

“That will depend on your capability.” Fang Hanluo started to circulate his Indigo Frost Battle Physique and frost intent at the same time.

“Flame Dragon Fist!” Yan Long’zi’s eyes flickered with disdain. Although he wasn’t using his strongest attack, the power was still very shocking. The flames surrounding his fist formed a massive dragon that shattered Fang Hanluo’s aura.

“Frost Star Explosion!” Seeing this, Fang Hanluo retaliated with a punch of his own.

The chill from Fang Hanluo’s punch caused Yan Long’zi’s flames to die down a bit. At the same time, the chill spread to Yan Long’zi’s body and started to cover him in a layer of ice. But a dazzling brilliance exploded from Yan Long’zi’s fist as golden flames surging around him.

Very quickly, Fang Hanluo and his intent were sent backwards.

Yan Long’zi snorted at the flying Fang Hanluo and attacked again. Fang Hanluo didn’t dare to belittle this punch and pushed his Indigo Frost Battle Physique to the limit as he collided with the flames.

When Yan Long’zi’s punch landed on Fang Hanluo, an explosion occurred. But when the dust settled, Fang Hanluo was unscathed. He used his movement technique to negate most of the force and easily took Yan Long’zi’s attack head-on.

Yan Long’zi merely laughed at this and pounced at Fang Hanluo before the latter could respond. In the blink of an eye, the two had exchanged over a dozen moves. Every single one of Yan Long’zi’s punches were like volcanic explosions as his flame intent burst out. The terrifying heatwave sent chills down everyone’s spines.

Ten moves later, Fang Hanluo was sent flying away as his face turned somewhat pale. But thanks to his Indigo Frost Battle Physique, he didn’t suffer any injuries. Many people were shocked that Fang Hanluo was still unharmed.

“You think your little trick can fool me? It’s nothing before absolute strength,” said Yan Long’zi. Naturally, all of the three kings noticed Fang Hanluo’s movement technique, but they didn’t think much of it.

“But clearly, you’re unable to injure me,” grinned Fang Hanluo as he soared into the sky. Using his strongest attack, Heavenly Frost Annihilation, Fang Hanluo threw one more punch at Yan Long’zi. Insanity appeared on his face as he pushed his cultivation to the limit while a blizzard brewed in the sky.

Once the powerful blizzard arrived, cracks began to spread out on the barrier. Yan Long’zi’s flame intent wasn’t as overbearing as Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon Sword Aura, so he couldn’t instantly destroy the attack. In fact, it was more troublesome for him to deal with Fang Hanluo’s attacks.

“How annoying!” Yan Long’zi finally lost his patience and crimson light flickered in his pupils. His energy began to roar violently within his body. The power accumulated in his body instantly reached ten cauldrons worth of strength and continued to rise.

However, the scariest part was that no one could sense his strength accumulating. Normally, gathering strength and origin energy would create a commotion, but not for Yan Long’zi.

Lin Yun looked at this scene with surprise in his heart. He could tell that Yan Long’zi was setting up a trap for Fang Hanluo.

In mid-air, Fang Hanluo watched Yan Long’zi dodge his attacks with excitement in his eyes. He wanted to increase his advantage, so he used his frost intent to suppress Yan Long’zi’s flame intent while blocking his path.

“Terranean Blizzard” Fang Hanluo’s origin energy exploded with dazzling brilliance coming from his body. With his Indigo Frost Battle Physique at its limit, his punch reached Yan Long’zi in the blink of an eye.

But in the next second, Fang Hanluo was sent flying even faster than when he attacked Yan Long’zi. A terrifying shockwave blasted Fang Hanluo away as countless cracks appeared on the barrier. At the same time, many of the spectators were spitting up blood.

Yan Long’zi’s upper body was exposed, revealing explosive muscles like that of a ferocious beast. A layer of gold covered every inch of his body after he unleashed his power. His punch that sent Fang Hanluo flying had 100 cauldrons worth of strength and was empowered by a wisp of the flame dragon’s bloodline. After waiting for the right opportunity, his accumulated strength successfully exploded onto Fang Hanluo.

The entire stage was swaying as the shockwave continued to ripple in the air. The shocking thing was that Yan Long’zi was only using his brute strength and not his origin energy.

Suddenly, Yan Long’zi stomped his foot on the ground and shot towards Fang Hanluo. He lifted the latter with one arm and tossed him across the stage.

He didn’t bother to use any fancy tricks and showed his dominance through brute strength. The impact of the toss even created a huge crater on the ground.

“Like I said, your little tricks are useless before absolute strength.” Yan Long’zi smiled sinisterly like a wild beast. His nature was just like a violent and brutal demonic beast. After all, only a beast would rely on brute strength while ignoring martial techniques, martial intent, and movement techniques of the opponent.

Is he dead? At this moment, everyone worried for Fang Hanluo’s life. After all, his Indigo Frost Battle Physique was broken before Yan Long’zi tossed him. In fact, there was a high possibility that he might just be a pile of meat now.

But right at this moment, a powerful sword intent soared into the sky as countless fireflies began to gather in the crater. Simultaneously, everyone could hear a buzzing noise from the stage.

“Quasi-spiritual sword intent!” Many Sacred Alliance’s elders exclaimed when they noticed this scene.
