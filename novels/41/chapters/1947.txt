Chapter 1948 - Who Do You Think You Are?

“It’s fine. I’ll come with you.” Bai Shuying followed up.

“Let’s go together, then,” Lin Yun smiled. He didn’t refuse Bai Shuying’s goodwill.

“Where is he?”

“He’s at the foot of the mountain. The peak master was holding them back and asked me to inform you. If you don’t want to meet them, I can bring you away and head to the Dragon Origin Great Saint’s residence,” Chen Feng said.

“I did nothing wrong, so why should I fear them? They’re the ones owing me, instead. So, let’s go,” Lin Yun smiled.

Bai Shuying didn’t say anything from the side. The Heavenly Dao Sect was heavily infested with four clans, and each clan had a powerful force within the sect. They have thoroughly infiltrated the Heavenly Dao Sect over the past few thousand years and have their own interests. The Heavenly Dao Sect didn’t have a sect master, and the sword-wielders didn’t care about these matters.

That was the same case for the Bai Clan. As for Ye Qingtian, she long heard that he didn’t have a good treatment within the Ye Clan, and his fellow clansmen wouldn’t give him any face within the sect.

It didn’t take long for them to reach the foot of the mountain. When they arrived, they saw Ye Feifan facing the peak master. Behind Ye Feifan were two Quasi-Saints and a Saint Elder, and they were his confidence. Even the Indigo Thunder Peak Master could only stop them for the moment, but not for much longer.

“Peak Master,” Lin Yun greeted.

The Indigo Thunder Peak Master was stunned, and Ye Feifan smiled, “Ye Qingtian, you’re finally out!”

“Greetings, Elder.” Lin Yun didn’t know these three people, so he casually gave a bow.

But this made the Saint Elder unhappily furrow his brow, and he questioned, “Ye Qingtian, it looks like you’re becoming increasingly cocky, since you’re not going down on your knees when seeing an elder of the same clan.”

“Speak if you have anything to say. I’m busy,” Lin Yun replied.

“Ye Qingtian, the ancestor wants to see you!” Ye Feifan roared.

“Oh,” Lin Yun casually replied. He naturally knew about this ancestor, the Tough Peak Saint Sovereign. He had the highest seniority of the Ye Clan within the Heavenly Dao Sect, so he was equivalent to half an ancestor of the Ye Clan.

But Lin Yun always felt that such an old monster was beyond his reach. So he naturally didn’t treat it seriously. But when he noticed Ye Feifan’s gaze, he naturally sensed that something was wrong and his identity was suspected.

His attitude also made the faces of the two Quasi-Saints and the Saint Elder change with their brows furrowed.

Ye Feifan roared, “Ye Qingtian, how dare you! The ancestor wants to meet you, and this is your attitude? It’s fine that you didn’t visit the ancestor after becoming the champion of the Di Group. But how dare you not have any respect when the ancestor is inviting you over!”

Hearing what Ye Feifan said, Lin Yun merely smiled, “Why do I have to be respectful to him? I have no intention of seeing him, to begin with. So go and tell him that I’m not free.”

The moment he said that, the faces of Ye Feifan and the others changed, including the Indigo Thunder Peak’s disciples.

“Do you think you have a choice?” Ye Feifan snorted and immediately made his move, unleashing his aura. He naturally couldn’t accept his previous loss to Ye Qingtian and couldn’t figure out how he lost to him with his cultivation at the fourth transformation of the Nirvana Stage.

Thus, he bitterly cultivated when he got back. His nirvana aura had transformed, and he drastically improved his strength, despite no changes in his cultivation. He was confident that he could deal with Ye Qingtian as long as the latter didn’t draw his sword.

As for Ye Qingtian drawing his sword? He didn’t think Ye Qingtian had that opportunity with the two Quasi-Saints and a Saint Elder behind him. They already came to an agreement that the Quasi-Saints would make a move the moment Ye Qingtian drew his sword.

At that time, the Indigo Thunder Peak Master couldn’t interfere because this was a private matter of their Ye Clan. If they brought Ye Qingtian to the ancestor, Ye Qingtian’s true identity would be revealed, even if his method was profound. At that time, no one could save him, even if he was the direct disciple of a Great Saint because Lin Yun would be dead for daring to disguise himself as a Ye Clan’s descendant.

He dashed over and pushed out three palms, each containing a huge force, and left behind a crater in the air. Cracks also began to appear on the ground, and Lin Yun secretly retreated, allowing Ye Feifan to get close to him.

“Ye Qingtian, where’s the grace of your sword from back then?” Ye Feifan wanted to force Lin Yun into drawing his sword and laughed. But he was shocked when he noticed that Ye Qingtian didn’t move and pushed his palm forth.

Lin Yun didn’t draw his sword nor release his sword intent. He merely pushed out his palm, relying on his cultivation. When the two palms collided, Ye Feifan threw out a mouthful of blood, his face drastically changing.

Ye Feifan was shocked to discover that Ye Qingitan’s cultivation had reached the seventh channel of the Profound Death Stage in just half a month!𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Seventh channel of the Profound Death Stage!”

“Holy shit, it has only been half a month!” The nearby Indigo Thunder Peak’s disciples were surprised. In the Ranking Battle, Ye Qingtian’s cultivation was only at the fifth channel of the Profound Death Stage, and yet he made two breakthroughs in half a month.

But what shocked them even more, was that Ye Qingtian relied on his cultivation to fend off Ye Feifan, whose cultivation was at the fourth transformation of the Nirvana Stage.

One must know that Ye Qingtian didn’t clash with those at the fourth channel of the Nirvana Stage head-on back at the Ranking Battle. Ye Qingtian relied on his Heavenly Dome Sword Intent and sword technique throughout the fight to defeat his opponents.

He first used his Divine Firefly Sword before using the Sword of the Beginning, relying on his sword to sweep through the Di Group.

When Lin Yun pushed his palm forth, Ye Feifan threw out a mouthful of blood and was sent flying away before a Quasi-Saint caught him from behind. He said, “I already gave you an opportunity, but you’re just a piece of garbage.”

“You’re not Ye Qingtian! Who the hell are you?!” Ye Feifan roared.

But Lin Yun merely sneered after hearing what he said and turned to the Quasi-Saints and Saint Elder, “Is that what the three of you think?”

“Everything will be clear after you meet the ancestor.” A Quasi-Saint of the Ye Clan stepped forth, wanting to grab Lin Yun.

But before he could get close, he was stopped by a white-clothed figure. Bai Shuying appeared before Ye Qingtian, and this scene shocked everyone.

As a gold and silver radiance shone from Bai Shuying, her pupils began to shine as she faced the Quasi-Saint head-on with her cultivation at the ninth transformation of the Nirvana Stage.

This made the face of the Ye Clan’s Quasi-Saint change, and he quickly retreated. He then turned to look at Saint Elder and asked, “Azure Solar Saint Lord?”

The Indigo Thunder Peak Master also became nervous. After all, no one could stop this group of people, no matter who came.

If that ancestor of the Ye Clan was determined to capture Ye Qingtian, even the Dragon Origin Great Saint couldn’t do anything about it. After all, the Ye Clan was colossal within the Heavenly Dao Sect. They might have no Great Saint on the surface, but it was unclear if they had any in the dark.

“The Bai Clan wants to interfere in my Ye Clan’s matters?” The Ye Clan’s Saint Elder asked.

“I dare not, but he already promised to come to the Nether Orchid Courtyard seven days from now. If he’s injured or doesn’t turn up, my master will be upset,” Bai Shuying said.

The Azure Solar Saint Lord sneered, “Even the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint can’t say anything about this matter. Ye Qingtian, you have to come with us no matter what, and I don’t want to involve anyone else in this matter.”

Lin Yun inwardly sighed and said, “Holy Maiden, let me handle this since this is a matter of my Ye Clan.”

He stepped forth and pushed Bai Shuying aside. But he stopped his footsteps and had no intention of leaving with that Saint Elder.

This naturally made the Saint Elder furrow his brow and coldly ask, “Ye Qingtian, how dare you resist before a saint? Are you courting death?!”

“Saint Elder, please calm down…” The Indigo Thunder Peak Master said.

“It has nothing to do with you,” the Azure Solar Saint Lord said. He might have his concern with Bai Shuying, but he had none with the Indigo Thunder Peak Master. So he didn’t hesitate to push his palm over.

This naturally made the Indigo Thunder Peak Master throw a mouthful of blood. When he slammed against the gate, he broke a few of his bones.

“Peak Master!” The Indigo Thunder Peak’s disciples quickly ran over.

Lin Yun was faster than everyone else and helped the peak master up. He looked at the Azure Solar Saint Lord and roared, “Old dog, don’t you know shame to make a move against a Quasi-Saint as a Saint Lord?!”

His words surprised Bai Shuying because she didn’t expect Ye Qingtian to be so bold.

“Everyone beneath the Saint Realm is mere ants. Ask him if he has any complaints about me injuring him,” the Azure Solar Saint Lord snickered.

The Indigo Thunder Peak Master quickly nodded and replied, “I naturally dare not to have any complaints.”

“Peak Master!” Lin Yun couldn’t hold back, but the Indigo Thunder Peak Master firmly held onto him, not wanting him to do anything foolish.

“Hahaha!” The Azure Solar Saint Lord laughed, “It looks like my Ye Clan really produced a genius to be so cocky before a Saint. I believe the ancestor will be happy when he sees you.”

The Azure Lord Saint Lord waved his hand. Aside from Bai Shuying, everyone standing before him was sent flying away and fell to the ground. The Azure Lord Saint Lord didn’t want to waste time with Ye Qingtian, and roared, “Come with me!”

But Lin Yun suddenly disappeared, and a massive power bounced him away. This changed the Azure Solar Saint Lord’s face because he failed to bring Ye Qingtian away. “Mhm?”

“Lil’ Qingyang, I can’t allow you to harm him.” A peal of laughter resounded, making the Azure Solar Saint Lord’s face change when he raised his head. But he was sent flying away before he could respond when a slap landed on him.

The Azure Solar Saint Lord fell onto the ground, and he didn’t dare to get back up as he looked at the newcomer in horror.

“Everyone beneath the Saint Realm are mere ants? Don’t you know that a Saint Lord is nothing before me?” That person placed Ye Qingtian on the ground before giving the Azure Solar Saint Lord another slap, sending him flying away.

“We pay our greetings to the Azure River Saint Sovereign!” The two Quasi-Saints and Ye Feifan quickly went down on their knees.

Bai Shuying also squinted her pupils when she saw Ye Guhan, who stood beside Ye Qingtian. Ye Guhan was the chief disciple of the Radiant Sword Saint, and even the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint was filled with praises for this person.
