Chapter 1754 – Settle Our Scores Slowly!

Demonic music is only a cheap trick? No one agreed with what Mei Zihua said. No matter how they looked at it, Yan Tianchen’s attainment in music dao wasn’t low. Mei Zihua might be strong, but what he said was an act of completely disregarding everyone there.

“Demonic music is a cheap trick? Let me experience your music, then!” Yan Tianchen also had his own pride, and he didn’t hesitate to play the flute. With a wisp of rage, he played the Nine Nether Demonic Music again.

When his flute music resounded, a crimson radiance shone from the end of the jade flute before spreading out. In a brief moment, the crimson radiance had already spread to a thousand feet. His music was like the wailing of ghosts that came from hell.

There was someone too close to the battle. They were caught in the attack and threw out a mouthful of blood. This instantly made everyone’s faces change as they quickly retreated.

The ghost wails combined with his music when the crimson radiance merged with the Dual Moon Lake’s lake water.

On the other hand, the stage that Yan Tianchen was on was enveloped in a crimson radiance. Everyone could only see his melody manifesting into various ghosts around him. The phenomenon of the Nine Nether Demonic Music wasn’t only terrifying, but could also launch a direct attack on the soul.

If one’s mental state wasn’t good enough, one would sink into the phenomenon and undergo endless torture. If one had a guilty heart, one would go insane.

“This is the Nine Nether Demonic Music?”

“Yan Tianchen seems to be holding back. Looks like what the pavilion master said was right.”

“Mei Zihua is too arrogant to say that Yan Tianchen only knew bits and pieces about music.” Everyone was shocked by Yan Tianchen’s performance. Even those by the lakeside observing this felt terrible because of the music. But Mei Zihua reacted as though he heard nothing, wearing a smile. He even closed his eyes and swayed his head from left to right. Others struggled to endure the music, but Mei Zihua enjoyed it.

“Not enough, still not enough…” Mei Zihua said.

The anger in Yan Tianchen’s pupils grew even denser, and his melody changed, becoming even more terrifying. A person appeared behind him that looked like a fiend god, singing an ancient song. The song sounded like it was trying to summon ghosts, sharp and ancient.

Everyone by the lakeside couldn’t help covering their ears, and it felt like their eardrums were about to be pierced through. Shortly after, the crimson radiance gradually converged to form multiple fiend gods on the lake.

At this moment, Yan Tianchen’s melody was like a piece of genuine demonic music, and the nine ghost kings were enveloped in a torrential crimson aura that went rampant. The ghost kings were terrifying, and everyone who looked at them couldn’t restrain the fear rising in their hearts.

Suddenly, Yan Tianchen’s melody changed before they charged towards Mei Zihua, wielding their weapons enveloped in the crimson radiance. When Mei Zihua suddenly opened his eyes, he finally made a move. He merely reached out with one finger and pulled a zither string stretched like a bow.

The string was stretched like a full moon, making everyone’s hearts lift to their throats. This was because the string looked like it would snap at any moment. When the nine ghost kings surrounded Mei Zihua and were about to devour him, the latter finally released his finger from the string.

As the sky rumbled, the first, second, and third layers of heaven began to shatter with starlight pouring down like a waterfall. Mei Zihua also released a dazzling brilliance like a silver moon in the night sky. Ancient runes had also appeared within his pupils, and those runes were emitting a dazzling radiance.

This made his already dashing appearance even more ethereal, and he looked as though he didn’t belong in the mortal world under the starlight.

In the next moment, Yan Tianchen’s music was disrupted. The ghost kings dissipated into crimson mist, but it didn’t stop there. When a soundwave spread, Yan Tianchen threw out a mouthful of blood, his face becoming terrifyingly pale.

Shortly after, Yan Tianchen threw out a few more mouthfuls of blood before he fell to one knee, clutching his chest. His facial expression was distorted with pain, and it didn’t take long for him to start bleeding from his seven orifices.

When the soundwave from Mei Zihua’s instrument spread out, the top hundred of the Nirvana Banquet felt a heavy blow, and they began to wail under the torture of the sound. All of them had lost. Mei Zihua relied on himself and a zither string to suppress everyone in the top hundred.

By the lakeside, everyone looked at Mei Zihua with disbelief and shock. Even those from the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion on the ship were surprised with disbelief. They knew that Mei Zihua was strong, but they never expected he would be strong enough to sweep through the top hundred in the Nirvana Banquet by himself.

Seeing this further made the face of the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion’s pavilion master even darker. Judging from how this matter was developing, the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion would probably give up hosting Nirvana Banquets in the future.

The surroundings fell into a dead silence. As Mei Zihua slowly got up, the starlight looked like a piece of clothing that was cladding him. Everyone could feel their hearts trembling when they raised their heads to look at Mei Zihua.

“Yan Tianchen, do you understand now?” Mei Zihua indifferently looked at Yan Tianchen. “This is why I say demonic music is a cheap trick!”

Yan Tianchen was bleeding from his seven orifices. When he raised his head, his pupils were reluctant, but there was nothing they could say or do about it.

“Lu’er, Hong’er, clean up this place.” Mei Zihua clapped his hands. He indifferently said, “The Nine Nether Demonic Music isn’t easy to practice, and you only know bits and pieces. Get your junior brother to come. Judging from your strength, I don’t think the first in the Nirvana Banquet will be that strong, and I can’t be bothered to look for him.”

Mei Zihua was initially interested in looking for Lin Yun. But after fighting Yan Tianchen, he instantly lost interest.

The two maids stepped forth and stowed the stage along with the zither. The surroundings were in a dead silence, with no one saying a word. Even the young pavilion master, Jiang Yingtian, was shocked and hadn’t recovered.

“No one is going to call him?” Mei Zihua furrowed his brows. He continued, “You guys really want me to look for him? I’m afraid he won’t be able to bear the consequences. Yan Tianchen, you should know what I’m trying to say, right?”

“You!” Yan Tianchen was furious because Mei Zihua was simply too arrogant.

“I advise you to call your junior brother out. Our young master only wants the Three-Lives Fruit. If our young master goes and looks for your junior brother, it won’t just end with the Three-Lives Fruit.” A maid standing beside Mei Zihua said coldly.

Hearing those words made Yan Tianchen furious, and he threw out a mouthful of blood because these people were too much.

“Who’s looking for me?” Right then, a man and a woman descended from the sky, holding hands.

An uproar broke out because the first in the Nirvana Banquet, Lin Xiao, had arrived. The man was dashing, and the woman was beautiful. They were Lin Yun and Yue Weiwei. When they heard what Luo Shuyi said, they immediately rushed over without any hesitation. But when they noticed Yan Tianchen’s injuries, their faces became ugly because those injuries weren’t light.

“Weiwei, help Senior Brother down first.” Lin Yun said after helping Yan Tianchen get up with Yue Weiwei.

“Junior Brother, be careful. He’s strong.” Yan Tianchen warned.

“It’s fine.” Lin Yun smiled.

“Senior Brother, let’s go down first.” Yue Weiwei’s face changed because Yan Tianchen’s injuries were too serious.

After they left, Lin Yun turned around to look at Mei Zihua, who was surrounded by his nine maids.

“You’re the one who’s first in the Nirvana Banquet, Lin Xiao?” Mei Zihua observed Lin Yun with his eyes squinted.

“It’s me.” Lin Yun replied indifferently.

“Good. I want your Three-Lives Fruit.” Mei Zihua smiled.

“Who the hell do you think you are? Why should I give it to you?” Lin Yun’s lip rose to a mocking smile.

“How dare you! My young master is the young master of the Mei Clan, one of the Ten Musical Clans!” The maid beside Mei Zihua spoke out.

“So? What does that have to do with me? I have to give it to you just because you want it? Does that mean you’ll give me your nine maids if I want them?” Lin Yun snickered.

When they heard that, the nine maids became furious, and looked at Lin Yun furiously.

Those words made the face of Yue Weiwei, who was examining Yan Tianchen’s injuries, become cold. Her cheeks puffed up, “Scumbag!”

“He’s just joking. Don’t treat it seriously.” Yan Tianchen smiled bitterly.

“I know. Senior Brother, don’t speak.” Yue Weiwei smiled with her eyes squinted.

Yan Tianchen didn’t say anything, but he felt Lin Yun would be in trouble even if he won, judging from Yue Weiwei’s gaze.

Mei Zihua smiled, and he looked at Lin Yun, “You’re a straightforward person, and I like it. If you can defeat me, you can have my nine maids. But if you lose, the Three-Lives Fruit goes to me. This is a fair bet, right?”

The corner of Lin Yun’s lip twitched when he heard that because he was just casually making an example.

“As first in the Nirvana Banquet, you should be qualified to fight me. But your senior brother’s performance was a little disappointing…” Mei Zihua said proudly, and he continued, “Yu’er, Lán’er, you two play with him. Perhaps there’s nothing impressive about being first in the Nirvana Banquet.”

“Yes, Young Master.” The two maids stepped forth. They were the strongest amongst the nine maids, Lu Yu and Lu Lán. They played the flute and ancient zither. When their melodies resounded, they were the Kill Zone score that Lu Hong had played previously.

When their melodies overlapped, it made Kill Zone even more terrifying. The Dual Moon Lake was turned into an ancient battlefield in the blink of an eye. Not to mention that the Divine Snow Plum Touch further empowered their melodies.

In a brief moment, the sky became dark, and the atmosphere on the Dual Moon Lake became solemn. Lin Yun naturally recognized the song they were playing, Kill Zone. This ancient score wasn’t rare, and the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion also had a copy. But it was hard to play it well, especially for women.

But this clearly wasn’t the first time Lu Yu and Lu Lán joined hands. When their melodies overlapped, they had reached a horrifying height with the wind and clouds changing.

On the other hand, Lin Yun took out the Thunderstorm Zither and sat down. When he sat down, the lakewater formed into a chair and table for him to place the Thunderstorm Zither, and his ten fingers began dancing on the zither.

Everyone was curious about what song Lin Yun would play, but they never expected that he would also play Kill Zone. But his Kill Zone didn’t only contain killing intent but also a wisp of sorrow. It sounded like the howling wind was crying, the thunder that was rumbling was filled with yearning, and the zither strings were filled with sympathy.

This Kill Zone was unique to Lin Yun, stopping slaughtering with love and touching heaven. This quickly turned the tables around. His melody was like a city wall; no matter how powerful Lu Yu and Lu Lán’s melodies were, they couldn’t cross the city walls.

The city walls were like towering mountains, and the soldiers stood on the ground to defend their homeland for their loved ones.

This changed Lu Yu and Lu Lán’s faces because they never expected that Kill Zone could be played this way. Just when they wanted to change the rhythm of their melody, they discovered it felt like they were in a quagmire.

Lin Yun’s version of Kill Zone didn’t just contain killing intent; he was telling a story through his music. His version of Kill Zone was gentle, reminiscing, and a mixture of rigidity and softness.

Where did the flowers go? The ladies plucked them. Where did the ladies go? They were married to young men. Where did the young men go? They became soldiers to defend their homeland. Where did the soldiers go? They died on the battlefield and were buried in tombs. Where did the tombs go? Wildflowers buried them.

Those who were by the lakeside started to tear up without them knowing it.

“What’s wrong? Why am I crying?”

“What is Lin Yun playing? Why does it sound so sad?” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Is this really Kill Zone?” Everyone was shocked when they looked at Lin Yu. It was as though they finally got to know him now.

Lu Yu and Lu Lán both had shame on their faces and were shocked while looking at Lin Yun. He was also playing Kill Zone like them, but anyone could tell that his Kill Zone was at a higher level than theirs, making them feel insignificant before him.

As Lin Yun’s ten fingers danced on the zither, he raised his brow, “Mei Zihua, are you still going to hide behind women? We still have to settle our scores slowly about how you injured my senior brother!”
