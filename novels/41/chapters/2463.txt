Chapter 2464 - Legend of the Heavenly Path

When the Radiant Sword Emperor approached the summit, the sword buzz echoing around the Heavenly Divine Mountain became even more radiant, shocking all the swordsmen present.

The Radiant Sword Emperor shattered a light screen in the sky and landed on the summit of the Heavenly Divine Mountain, heading towards the path in the clouds.

“What should we do now? How are we going to go up?” Feng Jue asked.

Lin Yun smiled bitterly because he didn’t expect his master to be so capricious.

The Thousand Plume Great Saint smiled, “Let’s wait. I believe someone will come to welcome us soon.”

The commotion created by the Radiant Sword Emperor was great, and many people who came noticed it.

“That’s Flower Burial, right?”

“The Radiant Sword Emperor’s disciples have all come...”

“I heard he wants to compete to see who’s the strongest swordsman beneath the Emperor Realm.”

“There are also rumors that he had refined the Heavenly Dragon Bone. The master and disciple plan to challenge the Skysolute City, the Radiant SSword Emperor challenges Yu Qingfeng while Lin Yun challenges the disciples of his lineage.”

“I heard that the Flower Burial said that he would first wipe the Skysolite City after he reaches the Emperor Realm.”

These people were far away, but Lin Yun’s group could hear it.

Lin Yun was stumped, and he frowned, “That exaggerating? Since when did I say that I want to do that...? This is ridiculous.”

Looking at how anxious Lin Yun became, Ye Guhan and everyone laughed.

Jian Jingtian smiled, “Junior Brother, not everything can go according to your plan. After reaching a certain position, you wouldn’t have a choice even if you don’t want to compete because everyone will force you.”

The Thousand Plume Great Saint smiled, “That’s normal. As the Ninth Heavenly Path champion, you’ve been first on the Empyrean, Elysium Core, Dragon Pulse, and Samsara Realms! On the Blue Dragon Banquet, you even suppressed the other Heavenly Path’s champions, not to mention the God Burial Mountain Range battle. Now...who in Kunlun Realm doesn’t know you after the battle in the Sword Sect?”

The Thousand Plume Great Saint was filled with emotions as he had witnessed Lin Yun’s moniker as Ye Qingtian rising together in the Heavenly Dao Sect. If possible, he wished that Lin Yun was Ye Qingtian.

By the side, Bai Shuying was depressed. She was on the same level as Lin Yun in the past, but he had surpassed her now.

Hearing the discussion, Lin Yun said, “It looks like this cannot be avoided.”

What his senior brothers and the Thousand Plume Great Saint said was right. After reaching a certain height, his intentions didn’t matter because everyone would push him to that spot. It was like a tidal wave carrying him around.

When the crowd discussed among themselves, several people instantly came before the crowd. The one leading was a young man, looking dignified and giving off a frightening sword intent. This person was the Skysolute City’s city lord, the Dao Suspend Sword Saint, the second disciple of Yu Qingfeng. He had long reached the pinnacle of the Great Saint Realm, and he could reach the Emperor Realm at any time.

He was a famous Sword Saint on the same level as the Divine Phoenix Holy Master. Beside him were all disciples of Yu Qingfeng.

Yu Qingfeng had a good relationship with the Radiant Sword Emperor and took great care of him. But all the disciples didn’t look friendly.

Ye Guhan smiled because he knew that they had already clashed. Then again, that couldn’t be helped because the Radiant Sword Emperor was here to challenge Yu Qingfeng no matter who looked at it. They might not hold any hostility, but they wanted to compete.

The atmosphere between both parties could have been better, and no one spoke out first.

Ultimately, the Thousand Plume Great Saint smiled, “Brother Dao Suspend, it has been long since we last met. How have you been?”

“Brother Thousand Plume, are the rumors true? Will the Heavenly Dao Sect merge with the Sword Sect? If that’s the case, I’m afraid that the strongest holy land for swordsmen will change from the Skysolute City,” the Dao Suspend Sword Saint smiled. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The Thousand Plume Great Saint smiled bitterly when he heard that. He waved his hand and said, “It’s nothing. They’re just rumors.”

“You must be Flower Burial? I heard that you’re here to challenge. All the sect masters from sword dao holy land were gathered in the Skysolute City, and they’re here for you,” a youth stood out beside the Dao Suspend Sword Saint, looking at Lin Yun with a smile. There wasn’t hostility from him but a hint of curiosity and unwillingness to admit defeat.

Lin Yun was already prepared and smiled, “If there’s an opportunity, why not? You are?”

His words naturally caused an uproar among the crowd.

“Well said!”

“The rumors are true...”

The crowd didn’t leave and stayed to watch when they saw the Skysolute City’s city lord coming out with a party.

The young swordsman smiled and said nothing.

The Dao Suspend Sword Saint said, “He’s a disciple master took in seventy years ago, Jian Jue. He’s a genius in the Skysolute City and was invincible among the younger generation in the Divine Dragon Empire.”

“Oh? Does that mean he’s a treasure of the Sword Emperor’s lineage? Junior Brother, he’s like you,” Jian Jingtian smiled, looking at Lin Yun.

“So it’s Young Master Jian Jue,” Lin Yun smiled.

Dao Yang and Bai Shuying stood by the side, bearing their laughter. They knew that Lin Yun didn’t know about this person, and he was merely pretending he did. But in reality, the two had misunderstood Lin Yun.

Lin Yun had heard of the Sword Emperor’s lineage long ago; it was just that he didn’t know that this person was Jian Jue.

“Oh?” Jian Jue was surprised. He smiled, “I heard your name after the Blue Dragon Banquet. You're the strongest genius since ancient times and unrivaled among the nine champions of the Heavenly Paths. Your name has spread far and wide, and it was proven once more.”

It has been a long time since someone called Lin Yun the champion of the Ninth Heavenly Path but addressed him by his title: Flower Burial.

Dao Suspend Sword Saint looked around, and he smiled, “Come into the city with me. If you carry on like this, people will say that our Skysolute City is rude.”

The Dao Suspend Sword Saint gave everyone a jade token. When they injected their saint aura into it, the pressure from the sword disappeared as everyone soared to the sky, heading towards the Skysolute City. Without the pressure of the giant sword, they quickly traveled ten thousand feet in the blink of an eye.

The Dao Suspend Sword Saint led everyone to the plaza in Skysolute City.

“Everyone, please have a seat. The various holy lands’ sect masters will soon arrive,” the Dao Suspend Sword Saint sat on the main seat while Lin Yun and the Sword Sect’s party sat on his left.

It didn’t take long before more swordsmen began to gather. They wouldn’t even have the qualification to sit without reaching the Saint Realm and could only stand by the side. Even so, more people arrived, soon filled with plaza, making it squeezy.

Countless gazes fell onto Lin Yun with curiosity. However, the first impression they received was Lin Yun’s young age. Their second impression was how unfathomable he was, and he possessed the demeanor of a grandmaster.

“The Frostsnow Sacred Palace’s sect master, the Chill Cloud Sword Saint has arrived!”

Along with an announcement, the sect masters of various holy lands began to arrive. Speaking of which, Lin Yun had interacted with these holy lands in the past.

“The Myriad Sword Pavilion’s sect master, the Profound Mountain Sword Saint has arrived!”

“The Black Plume Palace’s sect master, the Heavenly Plume Sword Saint has arrived!”

“The Heavenly Dragon Monastery’s venerable, the Profound Dragon Sword Saint has arrived!”

“The Hidden Sword Manor’s Spiritual Seal Sword Saint has arrived!”

“The Liu Saint Clan’s Abyssal Flame Sword Saint has arrived!”

The various sect masters and patriarchs representing holy lands and clans who practiced sword daos began to arrive, and they were the strongest sword saints in the world, the strongest batch beneath the Emperor Realm.

Aside from that, many sword dao great saints arrived. This left Lin Yun speechless because this scene was shocking.

Even Jian Jingtian kept his arrogance and whispered to Lin Yun, “Junior Brother, this scene is too big. All the famous sword saints in the Kunlun Realm have come. Don’t embarrass our master.”

Lin Yun merely smiled upon hearing that. Before coming, he also didn’t expect it would be so grand that even the monks from the Heavenly Dragon Monastery had come. He didn’t know that there were swordsmen among monks.

This gave Lin Yun a headache; he could only drink wine to calm his emotions.

Among the Heavenly Dragon Monastery’s party, Xin Yan had covered her face with a veil, staring at Lin Yun. When she looked at Lin Yun drinking wine, she couldn’t help smiling and saw a new side to this junior brother of hers.

“I’m grateful that everyone came despite the journey. First toast to the Ancient Barren Domain’s Sword Sect, to the Radiant Sword Emperor and Flower Burial!” The Dao Suspend Sword Saint raised his cup and showed his demeanor even though the Sword Sect was here to challenge them.

“To the Radiant Sword Emperor and Flower Burial!” All the Sword Saints in the plaza stood up and gave a toast to Lin Yun.

No one felt something was wrong because the Radiant Sword Emperor and Flower Burial were worthy of their toast.

Xin Yan’s eyes shone brightly. But because she was among the Heavenly Dragon Monastery’s party, she could only use tea to replace wine and toast with everyone. At this moment, all the Sword Saints in the world were giving a toast to Lin Yun, and this was a shocking scene that made Xin Yan happy.

Lin Yun was surprised and smiled, “No need to be so polite. Likewise, I also toast everyone to it.”

As everyone drank, Yu Qingfeng and the Radiant Sword Emperor also drank wine. Yu Qingfeng smiled, “Radiant, why don’t we look at the competition between the youngsters before our fight?”

“I share the same thought,” the Radiant Sword Emperor smiled.

“Come, have a drink and look at Flower Burial’s performance today!” Yu Qingfeng smiled.
