Chapter 729 - Kill Again

Both Qin Xu and Ouyang Hao’s heads fell onto the ground with their eyes wide open. The entire mountain was silent for a brief moment and everyone stopped breathing. A long time later, a commotion rang out as everyone was too shocked. In fact, the clamor of the crowd got out of control.

“Ouyang Hao and Qin Xu are dead?” Up until now, no one could believe what they saw. They were even more shocked at the person who was standing on the Heavenly Demon Pavilion’s stage.

Everyone was shocked when they looked at Lin Yun. No one could imagine that this was the same person they were mocking a few days ago. Not only was he alive, but he was also standing before everyone and even killed two of the seven geniuses. The shock they felt couldn’t be described with words.

“H-how is this possible?!” On the Northern Snow Manor’s stage, Gu Yang and the Jin brothers were completely dumbfounded. They had witnessed how terrifying the Profound Note Bell’s explosion was. Even a demonic beast like the Dragon Blooded Horse was ripped into pieces by the explosion. So how could Lin Yun possibly survive the explosion?

This had completely surpassed their imagination. Of the remaining seven geniuses, Chen Ziyu was naturally in the most awkward position. After all, he was the one who spread the news that he killed Lin Yun in three moves. Lin Yun killing Ouyang Hao and Qin Xu was a resounding slap to his face.

This meant that Lin Yun wasn’t dead and that he hadn’t been killed in three moves. Looking at this scene, the disciples and elders from the Indigomoon Elysium all wore an ugly expression, especially Qing Ruoyou. The sword slave had appeared once more!

“Hahaha, I knew it! Chen Ziyu killing Lin Yun in three moves was fake! Flower Burial isn’t dead!” Guo Xu laughed. Yang Fan was also shocked beside him, but he became excited when he saw the two heads.

“It looks like the rumours were true! Lin Yun wasn’t defeated by Chen Ziyu, but he was ganged up on by the seven geniuses before he was suppressed by the Profound Note Bell!”

“How can the news be fake? I witnessed the Chen Clan send out a quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm expert. I never believed that Lin Yun wasn’t dead.”

“He’s here to take revenge! He’s really brave, killing without caring about the four clans!”

“If he joins the Heavenly Demon Pavilion, no one will dare to provoke him. But it won’t be easy to kill the rest. I wonder what he will choose.” Cultivators who weren’t Skymound City were already unhappy with the seven geniuses. So they couldn’t help feeling excited when they saw Lin Yun.

“Flower Burial Lin Yun? Young lad, are you willing to join my Heavenly Demon Pavilion? No matter what you’ve done previously, the Heavenly Demon Pavilion will back you up.” The middle-aged man seated on the Heavenly Demon Pavilion’s seat laughed. After all, someone like Lin Yun was exactly what they needed.

“Perhaps the Northern Snow Manor suits me more.” Lin Yun swept his glance at Gu Yang and the Jin brothers.

The eyes of the Northern Snow Manor lit up as they smiled, “Young lad, since you’re a swordsman, you should come to our Northern Snow Manor.”

“These fellows!” The middle-aged man from the Heavenly Demon Pavilion started cursing.

Upon hearing that, everyone sucked in a cold breath. They knew that Lin Yun wouldn’t let this matter rest so easily.

“You dare?!” Elders of the Jin and Gu Clans yelled as they unleashed their killing aura. Did Lin Yun really think that they were pushovers?

“Why not?” Lin Yun sneered. He had already made up his mind that he would take the lives of the seven geniuses. He soared into the sky and headed towards the Northern Snow Manor. But before he landed on the stage, eighteen swords began to hum on the stage. As the swords began to hum, a terrifying sword intent spread out that made the entire stage tremble and the sky turn dark.

“This is?” Everyone’s faces changed. Just when they were baffled, the buzzing resonated even louder as a sword flew up. Shortly after, all eighteen swords flew up and emitted a dazzling brilliance.

“This…”

“Holy shit! Eighteen swords! Gu Yang only managed to attract eight swords.”

“Can he take it?” Everyone’s faces changed as they never expected such a terrifying commotion.

The Gu and Jin Clan’s elders were briefly stunned before they started laughing. They knew that Lin Yun would die if he was careless. Simultaneously, Gu Yang and the Jin brothers also loosen up with a smile on their faces. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

They had passed the test, so they knew how terrifying the sword array was. Facing eighteen swords, even if Lin Yun survived, there was no doubt that he would be heavily injured. This was also because Lin Yun was courting death.

“You’re courting death. Let me see if you can keep smiling afterwards!” Gu Yang snickered with killing intent spreading out in his eyes. Even the Jin brothers were smiling as they no longer had to worry.

Even the elders from the Northern Snow Manor were doubtful. When they set up the array, they never expected that someone could trigger eighteen swords. Such talent was comparable to Nangong Wanyu. Do we need to destroy the sword array? If the Northern Snow Manor actually did that, it would be a slap to their face. After all, they would be spoiling the assessment if they did it for Lin Yun.

“Elder Mo, we can’t allow him to die!” The elders were impatient as they called out to the old man in charge. The old man’s eyes turned dark, but he said nothing. After all, the sword array was used to test one’s potential. Even if Nangong Wanyu was here, he would also suffer the attack of eighteen swords. But Nangong Wanyu was a lot stronger than Lin Yun, so it wasn’t hard for him to face the array. If such a genius was killed by the sword array, it would make them a laughingstock.

In the end, Elder Mo decided to make his decision to destroy the sword array. As of right now, he couldn’t worry about the aftermath. After all, Lin Yun was a seed comparable to Nangong Wanyu, so it was nothing if he broke a rule for Lin Yun.

But right at this moment, the sky suddenly turned dark as Lin Yun activated the Aurora Dragon’s Eyes. A wisp of flame blazed in the depth of his pupils and emitted an ancient aura. In that split second, he detected the sword array’s flaws.

When he called off the Aurora Dragon’s Eyes, he flashed through the sword array and it started to collapse.

“This…” This scene had left many people dumbfounded.

Lin Yun landed on the stage unscathed as he looked at Gu Yang and the Jin brothers, “You better join forces. Otherwise, you guys will die a terrible death.”

As the wind blew past, Lin Yun’s voice was filled with a killing aura that spread throughout the mountain. This place had gathered all seven of Skymound City’s geniuses and even Qing Ruoyou was here. But now, everyone’s gaze fell onto Lin Yun. Are the seven geniuses really the protagonists? All of them are going to be killed by Lin Yun.

Gu Yang, Jin Zhan, and Jin Yi were three geniuses of Skymound City. So, they never experienced such humiliation in the past. After all, who would stick their nose up and tell them to attack together?

“You’re courting death! You managed to run previously, but this time we’re killing you!” Gu Yang summoned his martial soul and a violent aura swept out. Jin Zhan was the first to attack as his golden flames condensed into a Thorn Flower descending like a meteorite.

Lin Yun soared into the sky and drew his sword. In that split second, his sword intent had reached the limit as he circulated the Overlord Sword. Stabbing his sword out, he only used a single move to destroy the Thorn Flower.

Then, Lin Yun spread his arms apart and charged towards Gu Yang like a golden crow. He had pushed his movement technique to the limit, but his sword was even faster. In that split second, the Overlord Sword and Seven Profound Steps had fused perfectly.

But right at this moment, Jin Zhan arrived. Summoning his demon wolf martial soul, he pushed his palm out and his purple aura condensed into a ferocious wolf claw that seemed to be poisonous. From its appearance alone, everyone knew that withstanding the wolf would be difficult.

If Lin Yun wanted to avoid this attack, he would have to give up attacking Gu Yang. But if he gave up, Gu Yang would surely attack Lin Yun and hold onto the initiative. They knew that Lin Yun could only give up in this situation.

“Well done!” Skymound City’s geniuses couldn’t help praising as the three of them worked well together. In the end, they were still part of the seven geniuses, so they definitely could exhaust Lin Yun to death after summoning their martial souls.

Give up? That’s impossible! He had already drawn his sword, so he would never cower in the face of danger.

Overlord Sword—Solar Slash!

Lin Yun’s sword aura formed into a pair of wings beside him as he destroyed Gu Yang’s attack. But his sword didn’t stop there as Gu Yang was severed into two right after. With that, another one of the seven geniuses had died.
