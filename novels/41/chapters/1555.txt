Chapter 1556 - Sovereign Dragon Fist

The Demonic Rune Tiger was still trying to see if it could escape. But when Lil’ Red fell onto its back, it suddenly became obedient because it could sense a bloodline suppression coming from the cat on its back. It instantly knew that Lil’ Red’s bloodline was even more ancient and stronger than its own, who was a monarch demonic beast.

Lin Yun tailed behind the two from afar, passing through many hidden places, routing through several lakes, and arriving in a forest covered with a poisonous mist. This place was covered in barren grasses and toxic mist. Even if someone found this place, they probably wouldn’t even be bothered to scout this area.

“Milord, this is it.” The Demonic Rune Tiger said, not daring to enter before Lin Yun came.

“What is this place?”

“Milord, this is where this king cultivates. This king found the poisonous mist and barren grasses.” The Demonic Rune Tiger said proudly. The Demonic Rune Tiger didn’t seem to be lying, but it was pretty weird for it to address itself as ‘this king.’

“Let’s go, then.” Lin Yun replied.

“Roger that, Milord.” The Demonic Rune Tiger took the lead into the forest. Seeing the Demonic Rune Tiger suddenly becoming so obedient, Lin Yun still couldn’t get used to it. After all, it was a monarch demonic beast, but it didn’t have any temper now.

If the Demonic Rune Tiger knew what Lin Yun was thinking, it would definitely cry on the spot. It naturally had a temper, but it didn’t dare to show its temper. It could be considered a genius amongst the demonic beasts with an extraordinary bloodline and various encounters. It had a higher cultivation than Lin Yun but was helpless before him.

It was even scared out of its wits when it saw the seas of flowers that Lin Yun summoned. For some reason, the cat riding on its back also made it feel an inexplicable fear. So why would it dare to show its temper?

When they passed through the forest, they discovered that it was completely different inside. There was a decent-sized spiritual lake. The spiritual lake had a waterfall raining down and a damaged stone monument beside the lake.

The stone monument was massive. Even when it was damaged, it was two meters in height with many patterns recorded on it. There were cultivation techniques, blade techniques, and various Demon Clans’ martial techniques.

When Lin Yun looked through them, he noticed that every single one of them was a holy spirit martial technique, and the blade technique used by the Demonic Rune Tiger was also recorded on it. As Lin Yun observed the blade technique, he noticed that it was an exquisite technique and perfect for demonic beasts of the tiger species.

“Where did you get this stone monument from?” Lin Yun asked.

“Milord, I coincidentally picked it up at the border of the forbidden ground. Several Demon Clans’ saints entered that region two hundred years ago, and a terrifying battle occurred. Many things flew out, and this stone monument was one of them.”

“There are many forbidden grounds in the mountain range. Which one are you talking about?”

“There’s only one forbidden ground for demonic beasts like us. That’s the source of the heavenly lake, the Myriad Demon Peak!”

Lin Yun was surprised that the Myriad Demon Peak was an ancient forbidden ground. It was said to have been around since ancient times.

“Empress, have you heard about that before?”

“Nope. I don’t have many memories of the ancient times, not to mention that I’m the Divine Phoenix Clan’s Supreme Heavenly Slaughter Empress of Four Seas, Eight Barrens, 36 Heavens, and 72 Earths. Why will I pay attention to the tiny Kunlun Realm?”

Lin Yun was speechless because Lil’ Purple started boasting again. He turned to the Demonic Rune Tiger and asked, “What happened to those saints?”

“They all died. I witnessed an old saint walking out of the forbidden ground and turning into a pool of blood. No one knows what happened inside, and I immediately fled, grabbing this stone monument.”

“Where did you get that saint blade from, then?”

“A random cultivator who wanted to kill me for my beast core and Tiger King Bone. But I killed him using some tricks.”

“Oh?” Lin Yun’s eyes lit up as he glared at the Demonic Rune Tiger, making it feel uneasy. “The Tiger King Bone sounds pretty valuable. It should be very nourishing to the body, right?”

The Demonic Rune Tiger seemed to have guessed something and began to tremble in fear. This made Lin Yun smile while looking at the tiger, terrified like a little cat, “Haha. You can leave first.”

“Alright. Milord, just call me if you need anything. This king will leave first.” The Demonic Rune Tiger squeezed out a smile before swiftly leaving.

As Lin Yun continued to observe the stone monument, he found many interesting things. Even ghost spirit martial techniques were recorded on the stone monument, which made him wonder what kind of forbidden ground the Myriad Demon Peak was. After all, even the Sword Sect didn’t have many ghost spirit martial techniques, most of which were derived from the Great Profound Sword Canon.

“This staff technique is suitable with Blackie.” Lil’ Purple flew out from the sword box and pointed at a staff technique recorded on the stone monument.

When Lin Yun looked at the technique Lil’ Purple had pointed out, this martial technique was called the Thirty-Six Heavenly Ape Staff Technique. Every form contained the profundity of star trails. Each sword form should correspond to a star trail, and thirty-six trails could combine to form a complicated phenomenon before unleashing a terrifying aura of the Ancient Heavenly Apes.

It just so happened that Lil’ Red practiced the Ancient Dracoape Art. Combined with the Thirty-Six Heavenly Ape Forms, it could form a set of Demon Clan techniques. Furthermore, Lil’ Red’s dracoape form was perfect with the Heavenly Ape Staff Technique.

“You teach him.” Lin Yun nodded.

“Hmph. With this empress around, I’m naturally the one suitable to reach Blackie!” Lil’ Purple proudly said.

This made Lin Yun smile. But just when he was about to reply to her, his face changed as he exclaimed, “What is this?”

There was an incredibly profound diagram at the top of the stone monument. If he had guessed correctly, it should be a Dragon Clan’s fist technique. Not only did it have the circulation diagram and various explanations, but he also saw a cauldron.

A sun and moon were shining above the cauldron and a person was standing on the cauldron, performing various fist techniques. Wasn’t that the Dragon Sun and Moon Cauldron? As for the sun and moon diagram, they looked like the Glorysun and Glorymoon Spirits.

Lin Yun’s eyes widened. He then took out the two spirits to compare them; they were completely identical. But when he looked up, wanting to find more information about this fist technique, it was suddenly cut off. This instantly made him feel terrible since it was suddenly cut off at the crucial part.

But even if the diagram was incomplete, Lin Yun could feel the unfathomable power of this fist technique. Just by taking a few glances, he could feel his blood boiling, even the Blue Dragon Bone, as a faint dragon aura was released from him.

“Why is it cut off?” Lin Yun looked at the stone monument's cracks because it lacked the critical portion. As he leaped to the back of the stone monument, he was disappointed since there was nothing recorded on the back.

“This should be a dragon spirit martial technique. It looks like the Dragon Clan’s Sovereign Dragon Fist!”

“Sovereign Dragon Fist?” Lin Yun’s eyes lit up, and he asked, “C-Can I practice it?”

“Normally, it should be impossible for you to practice a dragon spirit martial technique. But you can try since you have the Blue Dragon Bone. But looking at the explanations on the diagram, the key is still the two spirits you possess. Otherwise, you wouldn’t even be able to enter the threshold of this martial technique by just relying on these diagrams.” Lil’ Purple replied.

“I never expected that the ultimate secret of the two spirits is the Sovereign Dragon Fist!” Lin Yun was shocked. After all, he heard that the two spirits contained a huge secret back on the Heavenly Path, but he didn’t expect it to be a Dragon Clan’s dragon spirit martial technique.

“But don’t be too happy so soon. It’s just like how you can barely use a Glory Saint Artifact. Even if you can practice it, you might be unable to unleash the true power of a dragon spirit martial technique. Otherwise, Jin Jue would’ve already been killed by the power of a Glory Saint Artifact.” Lil’ Purple said, reminding Lin Yun not to be so excited. “Furthermore, you might not succeed because this Dragon Sun and Moon Cauldron is really mysterious.”

“It doesn’t matter. It’ll still be comparable to a ghost spirit martial technique!” Lin Yun smiled. “My master doesn’t allow me to practice ghost spirit sword techniques because the Carefree 9 Swords and Aquaheaven Sword Technique are enough. But there isn’t any restriction for a fist technique!”

Lin Yun spent the remaining time trying to refine the two glory spirits while Lil’ Red started practicing the Heavenly Ape Staff Technique under Lil’ Purple’s guidance. They immediately went into seclusion in the Demonic Rune Tiger’s territory.

Refining the two spirits was more troublesome than Lin Yun had expected. He had to inject dragon blood and burn them with it to slowly refine the two spirits into a part of his body. This process was more troublesome than refining saint elixirs because Lin Yun wasn’t a member of the Dragon Clan.

He might have the Divine Dragon Bone, but he didn’t have the bloodline of the Dragon Clan. The Dragon Blood contained in his blood was thin, and he could only refine a trace of it, even if he pushed the Blue Dragon Bone to the limit, not to mention that the process was painful.

But thinking he could learn a dragon spirit martial technique upon success, Lin Yun was still pretty excited about it. Even if it was an incomplete dragon spirit martial technique, it should be comparable to high-grade ghost spirit martial techniques. The upper limit would also be terrifying if he could reach a high realm.

In the blink of an eye, Lin Yun had spent nearly a month there. He was left with his skin sticking to his bones and his face pale. This was because the vitality he had to exhaust in condensing dragon blood was more terrifying than using the Azure Dragon Grasp, not to mention that he had to persist. Even with the Azure Dragon Saint Physique, he was still overwhelmed by it.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Hehe. Lord Lin.” The Demonic Rune Tiger appeared. It had learned Lin Yun’s name over the past month. But this time, it came with lots of fruits, and each of those fruits contained a terrifying vitality. The fruits were throbbing like the hearts of demonic beasts.

“What are these?” Lin Yun asked.

“Haha. I brought you some fruit. They might not be saint fruits, but they can be used to replenish your vitality.” The Demonic Rune Tiger revealed a fawning smile. But as a tiger king, it looked mighty, even if it had a fawning smile.

But this made Lin Yun feel uncomfortable because the Demonic Rune Tiger was a tiger king. Yet, it looked so pathetic now.

This was because the Demonic Rune Tiger didn’t have a choice. He could tell Lin Yun had exhausted much of his vitality, and he naturally had to find ways to resolve it, fearing that Lin Yun might go after his Tiger King Bone.

“Lord Lin, why don’t you try them?” The Demonic Rune Tiger said, squeezing out a smile.

“Put them down. I’ll eat them later.” Lin Yun smiled. The fruits came at the right time, and he had no reason to reject them.
