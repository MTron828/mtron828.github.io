Chapter 2063 - Anyone Dare To Fight Me (1)

The silver sword radiance enveloped a hundred feet of radius. This was the prototype of the sword domain and the power of the Azure Dragon Sword Heart reaching the Spiritual Stage. Under the empowerment of the Sword Heart, Lin Yun’s sword aura instantly crushed Gu Zijing.Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Gu Zijing was shocked because he finally knew why Ye Qingtian kept retreating. His attack was stopped before Ye Qingtian’s forehead, and he couldn’t proceed any further, no matter how he tried. When the sword trembled in his hand, Gu Zijing was sent flying away, throwing out a mouthful of blood.

Relying on the Azure Dragon Sword Heart’s power, Lin Yun was enveloped in a silver radiance, with his hair fluttering in the wind and each strand of his hair enveloped in luster. He was like a deity at this moment as the Flower Burial Sword unleashed a sword ray that had reached a hundred feet, tearing apart the clouds.

Gu Zijing threw out another mouthful of sword and fell onto one knee. But relying on this opportunity, Gu Zijing finally held onto his sword that was sent flying away.

“Heavenly Seal!” Gu Zijing didn’t dare to be careless and executed the Heavenly Sealing Sword Canon. In brief, nine stars appeared behind him, with every star releasing an eternal radiance. His sword intent began to explode, breaking through the silver sword’s radiant restraint and blocking the incoming sword.

As the two sword rays clashed, the clouds within a ten-mile radius shattered and formed into a powerful gale. As starlight shone from above, everyone raised their heads and could feel their scalps going numb; they were all shocked by this battle.

“Nine Heavenly Wind, Myriad Ice Seal!” Gu Zijing relied on the Heavenly Sealing Sword Canon to catch his breath when a powerful gale appeared, causing the giant sword in the sky to tremble.

The shackles in the sky began to sway, causing ripples to fluctuate on the lake. As the swords clashed, neither Gu Zijing nor Lin Yun held back in their attacks and even used the glory spirits within their swords.

They were both strong and could bring out a hundred percent of their glory saint artifact’s attacks, which was a shocking scene. When the audience saw this, their mouths were wide open while watching this unbelievable clash.

A dragon and phoenix danced with blooming Netherflowers and countless sword rays covering the sky, releasing a dazzling radiance. The hilt of the giant sword was like a vast stage for Lin Yun and Gu Zijing to fight on with starlight shining down from the sky.

Lin Yun and Gu Zijing were evenly matched. Lin Yun had the empowerment of the Azure Dragon Sword Heart. Thus, his sword intent managed to suppress his opponent. In the path of the Flower Burial Sword, it looked like a monarch with everything bowing.

Gu Zijing relied on the Myriad Astral Eye, Heavenly Sealing Sword Canon, and the nine stars behind him to resist the incoming sword aura, and the strength he revealed made everyone in the surroundings exclaim.

“Isn’t this a little too unbelievable? They’re both monsters!”

“Just when I thought Ye Qingtian would lose, he brought out the Sword Heart. When I thought Gu Zijing was finished, he stood back up again!”

“The Ice Emperor’s lineage is really terrifying, and I’m afraid that it isn’t any weaker than the Nine Emperors.”

“What do you guys know? Ye Qingtian is heaven-defying! That’s the Sword Heart we’re talking about. Do you know what grasping the Sword Heart at the Nirvana Stage means? This is simply too unbelievable!”

The Sword Alliance was a gathering of all sword dao holy lands in the world, and they naturally knew how tough it was to grasp the Sword Heart. The difficulty wasn’t just trying to climb the heavens, it was harder than climbing over the heavens!

Many people became incoherent. Even the Sword Alliance geniuses were convinced by Ye Qingtian’s strength.

“Ye Qingtian has won in terms of sword dao,” Jiang Yunting sighed with a grave expression.

Feng Shaoyu’s face was dark, but he didn’t say anything. How could he not tell that Gu Zijing was barely holding on after relying on a secret technique? This was the Ice Emperor’s lineage. If it was someone else in his position, they would’ve lost the moment Ye Qingtian brought out his Sword Heart.

Zhao Wuji returned to the palace and said, “It’s hard to say how long Ye Qingtian can keep using the Sword Heart. Furthermore, Gu Zijing’s trump card is the Divine Firefly Sword! Isn’t Ye Qingtian strong? He’ll know the difference between him and Gu Zijing once the latter executes the second section of the Divine Firefly Sword.”

Zhao Wuji wasn’t convinced by his loss and placed all his hopes on Gu Zijing, hoping that the latter could help him take revenge.

Feng Shaoyu clenched his fist, “That’s right. The outcome of this battle is still undecided, and Gu Ziling still has a chance!”

Jiang Yunting didn’t say a word, but his gaze changed when he looked at Ye Qingtian.

The Divine Firefly Sword? Did these people really feel that Ye Qingtian has only grasped five swords since he had already grasped the Sword Heart?

He didn’t know what to say to these naive people, but Jiang Yunting didn’t say it out loud because he was also a member of the Sword Alliance, and he naturally hoped that he was wrong and that Gu Zijing would win the fight.

The two swords clashed together with another explosion in the sky but soon separated. The clash created a reverberating echo that rumbled like thunder. Lin Yun was hovering in the air like a leaf, standing at the edge of the giant sword as though he was standing on the edge of a cliff.

“Tsk, tsk. I’m impressed with your Azure Dragon Sword Heart. The Blue Dragon Record will soon appear, and I’m honored to have met an opponent like you before the Blue Dragon Record appeared. I have to thank you for granting me this fight.” Gu Zijing looked at Ye Qingtian with the corner of his lips rising on his pale face. Ye Qingtian had given him too many surprises during this fight.

Gu Zijing believed that his attainment in sword dao would take a step further if he could defeat Ye Qingtian.

“I can’t spend too much time with you because the Nine Star Secret Art can only last for a few minutes, and I have to defeat you before the Nine Star Secret Art ends,” Gu Zijing said in a confident tone as he looked at Ye Qingtian.

“Heaven!”

Gu Zijing roared as his sword hovered before him while he formed an ancient seal with two hands and began releasing a powerful aura.

“Earth!”

The distant mountains began to tremble as a current flowed from them and converging on Gu Zijing. In a brief moment, Gu Zijing had mobilized the power of heaven and earth, perfectly fusing the two.

Ultimately, the aura manifested into an indigo ice phoenix that appeared behind him. The phoenix spread its wings apart, giving off an ancient aura. Under the infusion of Gu Zijing’s vitality, the phoenix looked vivid.
