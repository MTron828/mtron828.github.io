Chapter 1278 - All Alone After Shining Brightly

Seeing the emotions in Lin Yun’s eyes, both Zhao Yan and Gongsun Yan were surprised. After all, it was rare for Lin Yun to reveal any emotions, and he was deep and unfathomable in their eyes. Back at the Sword Assembly, Lin Yun didn’t have any changes on his face when he faced the three challenges. So why did he show emotions when the Profound Sky Sect was mentioned?

When Gongsun Yan pointed in the direction of the Profound Sky Sect, Lin Yun could see hundreds of disciples from the Profound Sky Sect appearing on the Sword Sect’s island, and they were all emitting a terrifying aura. Amongst them, there were three people that stood out the most, they were so much like dazzling stars shining in the darkness that no one could neglect their presence.

“The current Profound Sky Sect is really terrifying.” Zhao Yan said with a grave expression. Even in the eyes of saint clans, the Profound Sky Sect was a colossal existence and there weren’t many forces in the Ancient Barren Domain that could confront them.

“Indeed, the Profound Sky Sect is terrifying,” said Gongsun Yan. “Their current sect master is called Tian Xuanzi, and he’s also known as the Profound Heaven Supreme Saint. He’s an expert who quickly rose up within five centuries, shining so brightly that no one could compete with him. He’s a genuine transcendent genius, and many people even guessed that his current strength is comparable to the old Sword Saint in the Sword Sect.”

Comparable to the Radiant Sword Saint? Lin Yun squinted his eyes. Tian Xuanzi was a little too terrifying, not to mention that he wasn’t even five hundred years old. The age of cultivators wasn’t that exaggerated. Those in the Samsara Edict Realm would have a lifespan of five hundred years, and even if they wouldn’t die after five hundred years, their strength would drop due to their declining physique.

Only the lifespan of saints could exceed a thousand years old, and they would need external help if they wanted to live longer, such as the Divine Blood Fruit that Lin Yun possessed. As for the higher realms, Lin Yun wasn’t too sure about that because it wasn’t even possible for him to come in contact with the Saint Realm, for now.

“With the three of them around, it looks like they’re pretty determined to obtain the saint elixir. It’ll be hard for the Sword Sect to keep the saint elixir,” sighed Zhao Yan.

“Are they that strong?” Lin Yun could sense that the three of them were all terrifying, but he had no idea just how strong they were.

“That’s for sure. They are ranked in the top three on the Empyrean Ranking,” said Gongsun Yan.

When Lin Yun heard that, he was shocked that a sect had occupied the top three positions on the Empyrean Ranking.

“Lei Jue is ranked third on the Empyrean Ranking with the nickname Thousand Lightning. His lightning intent has long reached the fourth stage. Xuan Ying is ranked second on the Empyrean Ranking with high attainments in flame intent. I heard that he had an encounter when he was young and devoured a saint flame seed. The two are comparable to greater Elysium Core Realm experts,” said Gongsun Yan. “But the strongest amongst them is Qin Cang, the direct descendant of the Nether Divinity Clan. He’s ranked one on the Empyrean Ranking.”

“The Nether Divinity Clan?” Lin Yun was attracted by those words and asked, “What relationship does the Nether Divinity Clan have with the Nether Divinity War Realm?”

“You have to ask Zhao Yan about that. He’s from a saint clan, so he definitely knows more than me about the Nether Divinity Clan,” smiled Gongsun Yan.

This made Zhao Yan roll his eyes at Gongsun Yan before he continued, “Beyond the thirty-six layers of heaven, there are many ruins left behind from the previous era, and some of those ruins have formed into an astral realm. The natives of those astral realms still possess an ancient inheritance and were filled with spiritual energy. It was so much so that saints could be born in those realms.”

Lin Yun wasn’t a stranger to that because he did hear that there were some mysterious regions beyond the thirty-six layers of heaven. He had already seen many lifeforms on the third layer of heaven, including the abundant amount of ancient palaces with cultivators cultivating there.

“Any astral realm that can give birth to a saint isn’t common, and they usually contain ancient inheritances from the previous era. After the Divine Dragon Empire took down those astral realms, they would bestow them to clans with great achievements. Those astral realms are also known as war realms, and the Qin Clan was bestowed the Nether Divinity War Realm. This is the same as having a territory acknowledged by the Divine Dragon Empire, and that means that their position will generally surpass ordinary saint clans.”

“The Nether Divinity Clan is even more special and is known as the head of all clans in the Ancient Barren Domain,” sighed Zhao Yan.

“So what happens if someone kills the Realm Sons of those war realms?” Lin Yun asked without any change on his face.

When Gongsun Yan and Zhao Yan heard that, their faces changed when they looked at Lin Yun. In the end, Gongsun Yan spoke first, “It’s best not to have that kind of thought.”

“Each Realm Son is treated as the young clan master, but I heard that five Realm Sons have died and five Realm Sons were crippled on the Ninth Heavenly Path. The Nether Divinity Realm Son was amongst them who died. The Nether Divinity Clan is looking everywhere for that ruthless person,” said Zhao Yan.

“I also heard that. Now that all the champions of the other Heavenly Paths are shining brightly in Kunlun Realm, the champion of the Ninth Heavenly Path still hasn’t shown up. This is a pity because he’s probably wasting his time hiding when he has such a shocking talent,” said Gongsun Yan.

Lin Yun fell into silence when he heard that. It looked like the turbulence that he caused in the Ninth Heavenly Path still hasn’t settled down. But he also knew that it was practically impossible for him to continue hiding his identity as the champion of the Ninth Heavenly Path on this trip to the Profound Wither Island.

Zhao Yan and Gongsun Yan soon bade their farewells to Lin Yun. They were both injured, and they naturally wanted to refine the Dragon Blood Fruit’s leaves as soon as possible. As for the saint elixir, they had no interest in that because they were already in such a pathetic state over a quasi-saint elixir.

After they left, Lin Yun continued to pay attention to the fight on the island that gave birth to the saint elixir and fell into deep thoughts. That’s the strength of those ranked in the top ten on the Empyrean Ranking?

Even from such a distance away, Lin Yun could sense their terrifying strength, especially the constellations summoned by them. He hadn’t manifested his constellation, and this meant that he would suffer a big loss if he faced them.

“Isn’t it bustling over there?” Lil’ Purple appeared at the summit of the snowy mountain. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Yeah.” Lin Yun acknowledged. It was bustling over there, but it had nothing to do with him because he couldn’t join in with his current strength. As long as he didn’t manifest his constellation, he wouldn’t be able to compete with them for the saint elixir, even if he wanted to.

“You look unhappy…” Lil’ Purple said.

Lin Yun maintained his silence as he stood at the summit of this snowy mountain, watching those monstrous geniuses shining brightly over there and captivating everyone’s attention. It was true that he was unhappy since he couldn’t join them. He wouldn’t have noticed his own feelings if Lil’ Purple didn’t say it.

After all, he had just suppressed eight geniuses just a moment ago, but was then forgotten by everyone now. Zhao Yan and Gongsun Yan also didn’t look surprised that he didn’t go after the saint elixir. They were sure that he didn’t have the qualifications to compete with those geniuses.

In the end, Lin Yun could only stand at the summit of this snowy mountain, looking at the fireworks from afar. Right at this moment, Lil’ Red landed on the ground with a huge jar that even caused the entire mountain to lightly shake.

“Hehe.” Lil’ Red chuckled before placing the huge jar on the ground.

“I’ve been waiting for you.” Lin Yun smiled and recollected himself before looking at the jar full of saint liquid. He could sense the terrifying ancient aura being emitted from the jar.

“Interesting…this place actually has a dragon blood pool and an array.” Lil’ Purple looked adorable in her white dress, and she couldn’t help rejoicing when she saw the blood pool.

“The energy contained within the blood pool seems to be even stronger than the saint liquid in the jar,” said Lin Yun.

“That’s for sure, but you can’t use it. There are still demonic traits left behind, and the baleful aura is too strong for you. On the other hand, it’s pretty suitable for Lil’ Red,” said Lil’ Purple. When she was done, she picked Lil’ Red up and tossed it into the blood pool, leaving Lin Yun completely dumbfounded with his jaw wide open.

“Alright, it’s your turn now.” Lil’ Purple landed on the jar.

“So…I just go in?” Lin Yun asked.

“No hurry. It still lacks something.”

“What is it lacking?”

“My breath!” Lil’ Purple said before the two runes on her forehead began to shine brightly. As her hair began to grow in length, it completely turned silver. A cold light was flickering in her pupils. At this moment, her entire temperament had undergone a huge transformation, as if she was the Supreme Heavenly Slaughter Empress that she spoke about.

When the silver light reached its peak, Lil’ Purple puffed her cheeks before she breathed out purple flames into the jar of saint liquid, causing the saint liquid to boil before it started to glow golden. But that wasn’t all. Lil’ Purple even cut her palm open and allowed her blood to flow into the jar.

This instantly made the entire jar boil as if an ancient aura had come to life. This scene naturally left Lin Yun dumbfounded. It wasn’t an exaggeration to call this “divine liquid” instead of “saint liquid”.

“Isn’t the cost a little too great?” Lin Yun said, looking at Lil’ Purple.

“Hmph. I took your Azure Dragon True Bone, resulting in the fact that you’re not able to reach perfection in the Azure Dragon Saint Art. So I naturally have to make it up to you. At the very least, I have to promote the saint rune into a divine rune. Otherwise, it’ll make me seem too petty,” said Lil’ Purple before her face blushed red. “N-Not to mention that you tied braids for me!”

When she was done, her silver hair began to fade and she also started to stagger. When Lin Yun looked at the liquid in the jar that had undergone a huge transformation, he was still in disbelief. Was this the opportunity that Lil’ Purple said she would prepare for him?

“Who are you?” Lin Yun couldn’t help asking after taking a deep breath.

“I’m the Divine Phoenix Clan’s Supreme Heavenly Slaughter Empress of Four Seas, Eight Barrens, 36 Heavens, and 72 Earths!” Lil’ Purple smiled.

“There’s no way I’ll believe that.” Lin Yun smiled before he jumped into the jar while taking out the Dragon Blood Fruit at the same time.
