Chapter 2365 - Bizarre Woods

Profound Sky Venerable only mentioned the number of spirit cores, but he didn’t say if they were forbidden to snatch from other cultivators. So everyone not only had to face demonspirits but also fellow cultivators.

“Lin Yun, what do you think?” Lin Jiangxian turned to look at Lin Yun, with Ji Zixi, Ao Jue, and Xiong Tiannan also looking over. In this group, Lin Yun had become the leader amongst them, and they were concerned about his opinion.

“I practically agree with what Ao Jue said, but...” Lin Yun paused, before he continued, “Since we’re acquainted, we might as well give our best. So don’t be afraid to trouble me.”

“Me as well?” Ao Jue was surprised. He didn’t stand on Lin Yun’s side back at the Sovereign Monument, unlike Xiong Tiannan, who bought time for Lin Yun against the hands of a divine disciple. So he was surprised that Lin Yun included him as well.

“Of course,” Lin Yun smiled. “Since you helped me in the first stage, I will naturally help you. Moreover, we have no idea who will be helping whom. Perhaps I will be the one needing help from you.”

What Lin Yun said wasn’t a lie because the dangers would be unpredictable, and there was no harm in having a friend.

Ao Jue’s eyes lit up, and his acknowledgment of Lin Yun rose even more.

“Truthfully speaking, Ji Zixi and I came from the Kunlun Realm, and I promised her father that I would send her to the Heavenly Barren Banquet no matter what,” Lin Yun said blatantly. Everyone was a friend, so Lin Yun would naturally help if they were in trouble. But there was a sequence with that. He didn’t like to hide it, so he openly shared it.

“Big Brother Lin...” Ji Zixi wanted to say something.

Lin Yun smiled, “Zixi, you don’t have to overthink it. Your father also promised me that he would do his best to help during my master’s tribulation. I’m here to seek opportunities, so you don’t have to feel guilty about it. On the contrary, I have to thank your father, instead.”

The Divine Phoenix Holy Master was at the pinnacle of the Great Saint and even grasped an Eternal Dao. So, he would naturally be more effective during the Radiant Sword Saint’s tribulation than Lin Yun. With the Divine Phoenix Holy Master, Lin Yun was confident that they could put up a fight even if the Divine Dragon Empire interfered.

“Profound Sky Venerable told me that there’s a high chance that the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity will pick you if you can make it to the Heavenly Barren Banquet,” Lin Yun said with a grave expression. “Divine Phoenix Mountain has waited a hundred thousand years for this opportunity, so don’t hesitate. Understood?”

Ji Zixi clenched her fist and felt a warmth in her heart. “I... I’m asking if we can participate in the Heavenly Barren Banquet together.”

“No need to be so tense. This isn’t ‘the end’ yet,” Lin Jiangxian joked with a smile.

Lin Yun was briefly stunned before he smiled and the tense atmosphere dissolved.

Ao Jue changed the topic, “There are some people we have to take note of aside from Heavenly Book and Jiang Ziyao.”

When everyone turned their attention over, Ao Jue said, “The one in the south is the Dao Sect’s Qin Yun.”

Lin Yun saw the person Ao Jue was pointing towards. This person was by himself, unlike the rest, donning a blue taoist robe while sitting on the ground. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“He’s the Dao Sect’s chief disciple, ranked in the top thirty on the Brandished Dragon Ranking. It is rumored that he’s an eighth-stage Saint Lord.”

“Eighth-stage Saint Lord?” Lin Yun was surprised. He experienced the tribulation once and knew the difference between the last three stages. After all, the seventh stage was already terrifying enough, not to mention the eighth stage.

There were rumors that after becoming an eighth-stage Saint Lord, the primordial aura would transform into stars above the saint energy ocean. With the empowerment of the stars, the saint energy would reach a new level, and they could unleash even more power.

Sensing Lin Yun’s gaze, Qin Yun opened his eyes with his aura turning into a golden dragon that charged at Lin Yun. But Lin Yun was calm and composed as an invisible sword intent tore the golden dragon apart, like a pebble thrown into the ocean. Qin Yun smiled before closing his eyes again.

When everyone saw the clash between Lin Yun and Qin Yun, they were shocked. Xiong Tiannan smiled, “It looks like you’ve become so famous that they cannot overlook you.”

Lin Yun examined those around him, and saw that they had already considered him as their opponent.

Ao Jue continued, “The one over there is even more dangerous than Qin Yun. He’s Tuoba Hong, a primordial beast. I heard that he’s a Heavenly Moonhowl Wolf.”

Lin Yun glanced at Tuobe Hong, who donned a white fur coat with a robust figure and a moon imprint on his forehead. He didn’t give off a violent aura like a demonic beast but looked like an elegant gentleman.

The other opponents that they had to pay attention to were also pointed out by Ao Jue, and they all had a terrifying background.

“Try not to start a conflict with them and focus on collecting spirit cores,” Lin Jiangxian said.

After discussing, they closed their eyes and waited for Profound Sky Venerable.

Lin Yun didn’t waste time and circulated the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon to familiarize himself with the two sword spirits. After his breakthrough, the boost in strength was even more tremendous than the breakthrough in his cultivation.

An hour later, Profound Sky Venerable gave everyone a medal. As long as they crushed it, they would be able to return to the Heavenly Barren Realm. The majority decided to stick around despite knowing that it would be dangerous.

“Since everyone has decided, let’s go then!” Profound Sky Venerable roared and the array on the stage became activated, with the entire Heavenly Barren Saint Mountain trembling, creating a majestic phenomenon.

“Open!” Profound Sky Venerable roared and the light enveloped everyone who was holding onto a medal. This also sparked the beginning of the third stage.

Everyone was pulled into a vortex with the entire world spinning. When they recovered their senses, Lin Yun opened his eyes to see Ji Zixi and everyone else standing beside him.

“Try to stick together,” Lin Yun said and they simultaneously moved out. Down below was a terrifying woods with demonic light gushing out. The black clouds had covered the sky, enveloping the entire woods.

When they descended, they could see bulges on the ground with no tablet erected, but they were all graves. Each tomb contained a demonspirit, and there were also empty graves. As long as they opened the tombs, they would face dangers.

“Isn’t this a tomb? Why are there so many graves? Are we supposed to find an entrance?” Ao Jue frowned and turned to Xiong Tiannan.

Lin Yun was also curious since this was different from the demonspirit’s tomb he had seen in the past.
