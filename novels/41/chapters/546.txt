Chapter 547 - Dazzling

Yang Xiong, Lu Zhan, and Qi Wenxiong were popular candidates to obtain the flower king. But all three of them were kneeling before Lin Yun right now.

Looking at Lin Yun’s cold gaze from afar, everyone could sense a chill run down their spines from the concentrated killing intent in Lin Yun’s eyes. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

No one could imagine what kind of pressure the three of them were currently facing. The three of them were terrified because they could sense that Lin Yun was really angry and that he would really kill them. Even their souls were shrouded in fear due to Lin Yun’s killing aura.

As Lin Yun slowly stepped forward, his killing aura surged even further, which made their faces turn pale. They wondered if Lin Yun would really kill them.

Yang Xiong gnashed his teeth as he looked at Lin Yun, “Lin Yun, we have already lowered our heads. Are you really going to kill us?”

“Kill you? Interesting. What were you doing a moment ago?” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly. “Who told me not to get close to Liu Yunyan? Who was the one who said that he would humiliate me? Who said that he would step on me?”

Lin Yun’s questions made Yang Xiong’s face turn red. He was the one who pushed it, but he still told Lin Yun not to take it too far. When Yang Xiong calmed down, the Flower Burial Sword slapped his face.

This left all the spectators shocked. Lin Yun actually slapped Yang Xiong with his sword, a core disciple who was comparable to those in the top ten ranking.

Lin Yun might be slapping Yang Xiong, but he was actually warning everyone that he wasn’t someone without a temper. If anyone crossed his bottomline, then it wasn’t something that could be easily resolved by kneeling.

The smack sent Yang Xiong flying. He fell onto the surface of water and bounced on the surface of the lake several times before he managed to stabilize himself. His eyes were filled with reluctance and grievance as he clenched his fists together. But when he bumped gazes with Lin Yun, he felt a jolt in his spine and quickly lowered his head.

This scene made many people sigh as they thought of how glorious Yang Xiong was when he first arrived. Everyone had expected Yang Xiong to be the biggest winner and Lin Yun to be thoroughly humiliated.

But no one had expected that reality would be so brutal. Not only did he fail to humiliate Lin Yun, but Yang Xiong even became a laughing stock and was heavily slapped.

“Lin Yun, w-we’re foolish. We shouldn’t have become your enemies,” said Lu Zhan and Qi Wenxiong with their voices trembling.

“Get lost.” Lin Yun couldn’t be bothered with them because he didn’t want to get his hands dirty.

Upon hearing that, Lu Zhan and Qi Wenxiong both felt relieved and quickly left. In the blink of an eye, only Lin Yun was left in the pillar. There was no doubt that he was the biggest winner here.

Just when everyone was shocked that Yang Xiong was sent flying, nine beams suddenly shot out from the heart of the lake. Every single beam was dazzling and when they shot into the sky, they caused the sky to change.

It didn’t take long for a rainbow colored rain to fall. From this, Lin Yun could feel his origin energy recovering at a rapid speed. As he circulated the Iris Sword Sutra, he could even sense his cultivation improving.

“That’s the Nine Rainbow Spiritual Rain!”

“The Nine Petals Profound Yin Flower is going to appear!”

“The effect of the rain isn’t any inferior to a third grade pellet. Lin Yun is enjoying all of it!”

“Don’t forget that this is just the beginning. He will soon become the owner of the Nine Petals Profound Yin Flower, not to mention a fourth grade pellet personally refined by the dean!”

“The opportunity of our academy fell into the hands of an outsider…” Everyone looked at Lin Yun with envious gazes. Even Mei Ziyan’s face had turned black because this wasn’t what he wanted to happen.

The Profound Yin Lake began to tremble violently as the spiritual rain fell even more ferociously. Right at this moment, a Profound Yin Flower flew out from the heart of the lake, causing a rainbow to form in the sky.

Under the rainbow, the Profound Yin Flower was so gorgeous that everything in the world paled in comparison. It looked like an ethereal flower as it attracted everyone’s attention.

On the peak, the elders were speechless as they watched this scene. The Nine Petals Profound Yin Flower was a flower king that would only appear once a decade. It was extremely useful to all the disciples in the Yin stage as it could save them ten years of bitter cultivation.

Many disciples were excited when they looked at the flower and Lin Yun’s silhouette. But ultimately, they suppressed their greed because none of them dared to provoke Lin Yun right now. They didn’t want to get slapped by a sword like Yang Xiong.

So in the end, they could only watch as Flower Burial from the Great Qin Empire obtained the Nine Petals Profound Yin Flower.

Looking at the flower, joy flashed across Lin Yun’s eyes. He could clearly sense the terrifying energy within the flower. If he could refine this flower, he would be able to reach the pinnacle Yin stage within a short time. It was a huge opportunity.

Lin Yun took a long time to calm himself down as he walked over, reaching for the flower with a smile. But right at this moment, a ferocious roar rang out from the bottom of the lake that caused the entire lake to start surging.

Lin Yun’s expression froze. Only a Yang stage demonic beast could possess such an aura. At the same time, the other disciples on the lake were stunned before they rejoiced. After all, they would have an opportunity if Lin Yun was killed by the demonic beast.

Lin Yun looked at the three hundred meter long scarlet python that charged out of the lake. The python was covered in flowery patterns as purple saliva dripped down from its jaw. The saliva caused a corrosive black mist to rise on the lake.

The beast was the Crimsonmist Python, a demonic beast born with the strength in the Profound Martial Realm. Upon reaching maturity, it could even reach the Yang stage or in rare cases, the Yin-Yang stage. But this Crimsonmist Python was still in its infancy as it was only three hundred meters. But even so, the fact that it could reach the Yang stage proved its talent.

“The Crimsonmist Python? Why is a demonic beast like that here…” Yu Mu’s face changed at this scene.

But just when he was going to help, he was stopped by the white-clothed elder who was smiling, “We already said that we’re not allowed to interfere.”

“Dean, Lin Yun has already won. This Crimsonmist Python is an unnecessary disaster. Even if Lin Yun survives, the Nine Petals Profound Yin Flower will definitely go to someone else,” said Yu Mu anxiously.

“Let’s wait and see,” said Tang Yu.

When the Crimsonmist Python appeared on the lake, it looked around and saw no one before it turned its attention to the Nine Petals Profound Yin Flower. But just when it was going to make a move, it suddenly sensed a threatening aura.

“Disregarding me?” Lin Yun sneered as he charged forward.

When the Crimsonmist Python saw Lin Yun charging over, it flung its tail down and raised a towering wave. But Lin Yun faced it indifferently as he destroyed the wave with a swing of his sword. At the same time, he avoided the tail before continuing his charge at the python.

With the Flower Burial Sword empowered by his origin energy, Lin Yun began to swing it down at the python. The collision caused metallic sounds to ring out. It looked like Lin Yun’s attacks weren’t enough to break the python’s defenses. The flower patterns on its scale looked like impenetrable armor.

Not only was Lin Yun unable to break its defences, but he even took a tail whip from the python. This sent Lin Yun flying as he threw up a mouthful of blood.

“He’s really arrogant. Did he think that he can defeat the Crimsonmist Python by himself?”

“Not even a cosmic artifact can break the Crimsonmist Python’s scale defences.”

“Let’s go and slaughter this python!” The surrounding disciples became excited when they saw this scene.

But right at this moment, Lin Yun stood up with eighty-one silver swords hovering around him. When the sword array started to circulate counterclockwise, Lin Yun’s figure began to release a bright silver glow. At the same time, his sword intent also rose to a terrifying height that stunned all the disciples who were about to charge forward.

But that wasn’t all as the sword array continued to revolve. Upon reaching three cycles, the eighty-one swords suddenly multiplied to two hundred and twenty-seven swords. At the same time, Lin Yun’s sword aura had turned into a beam that shot into the sky. The dazzling radiance coming from Lin Yun forced everyone to close their eyes. No one dared to look straight at him.
