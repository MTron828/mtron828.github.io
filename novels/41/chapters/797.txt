Chapter 798 - Never Back Down!

Dazzling lightning enveloped Lin Yun as over a hundred dragon runes wandered around the surface of his body. At this moment, it looked like a majestic dragon was coiled around his body. The dragon runes contained explosive power that granted Lin Yun the power to tear mountains apart.

“Pitiful tricks. This little game has come to an end!” Lin Tao’s face turned grave as he stomped his foot on the ground and attacked.

“Is that so?” Lin Yun snorted coldly and faced Lin Tao head-on. In the next second, they disappeared and then a huge explosion occurred on the stage.

The lake surrounding the stage began to boil and thunderclouds started covering the sky. The huge explosion echoed out and disrupted the blood flow of those that were nearby. After Lin Yun and Lin Tao brought out their body-refining techniques, constant explosions filled the air. Some people even threw up mouthfuls of blood and fainted from the shockwaves.

The crowd simmered down and watched the battle in shock. They saw two people clashing violently on the ancient stage while lightning and flames spread everywhere. The fluctuation in the sky spread out like a ripple. Even the lake reacted from the collisions and created huge waves.

Everyone was shocked by the intensity of this fight. The shockwaves were terrifying, so the power of the actual attacks was unimaginable.

Lin Yun suddenly formed seals with his hands and threw out a punch, “Omnipresent Anger, Raging Sky!”

Combining two forms of the Seven Slaughtering Fists together, boundless origin energy rushed out like an ocean filled with endless rage. The might of this punch was shocking and manifested a phenomenon of destructive crimson mist.

“Thousand Absolute Fist!” Lin Tao wore a grave expression as he sensed the immense pressure coming at him. He quickly circulated his Profound Yang Art and unleashed dozens of punches that contained flame intent. In the blink of an eye, the two exchanged over a thousand moves.

Lin Tao was surprised as he fought because he realized that he couldn’t gain the upperhand. As for Lin Yun, he grew even more courageous as he fought. A wisp of killing aura flashed in his eyes as he threw his punch out.

This time, Lin Tao’s face changed while he dodged the attack. When Lin Yun’s punch landed on the ground, cracks swiftly spread out on the surface of the stage, leaving behind a crater. When everyone saw this scene, they heard a ringing in their ears. Lin Yun’s punch was terrifying since it could destroy the stage.

“How terrifying. Those fellows are a little too crazy.”

“They’re simply monsters. I can sense that not even an ordinary Heavenly Soul Realm expert can deal with them.” Many spectators turned pale from this scene. Even some initial Heavenly Soul Realm expert had fear in their voices. However, they were even more shocked to see that Lin Yun was evenly matched with Lin Tao.

Pushing the Seven Slaughtering Fist to the limit, Lin Yun’s punches were stronger due to the exponential increase in killing aura. Lin Yun was clearly vicious as he mixed his dragon aura in the attacks as well. A sinister expression filled his face as he vented all of his anger.

The crowd was shocked by this development. They knew that Lin Yun was a ruthless person because he dared to kill someone at the beginning of the banquet. However, they didn’t think too much of it when Lin Yun didn’t reveal his fangs on purpose. This made people like Lin Tao treat him as a pushover, as if it was a crime that he didn’t give in. But since this was a competition, Lin Yun was going to compete.

“How annoying. Thousand Absolute Fist—Absolute Heaven!” Lin Tao finally roared out of annoyance. Golden flames quickly enveloped his body as origin energy roared furiously. In the blink of an eye, his already giant body grew even bigger and more sinister.

A wild and violent aura swept across the stage from this transformation. Then, the sky turned dark as a mountain-like headed for Lin Yun.

Before Lin Tao’s fist descended, the lake already started to boil violently. Under his fist, the massive stage actually seemed tiny, which left many people shocked. Was Lin Tao finally going to bring everything he had?

“Defiant Frustration!” A desolate aura exploded from Lin Yun as the rage in his heart grew even greater. Then, the hatred and rage in his heart manifested into endless grandeur.

Lin Tao smiled as he poured all of his emotions into his fist. When the two punches clashed, Lin Tao’s enormous attack shattered and countless fireballs rained down.

“Thousand Absolute Fist—Annihilation!” Even though his attack was destroyed, Lin Tao confidently attacked once again. He divided into eight figures that gave Lin Yun a punch. The flames on the punches were like a boundless sea of flames that wanted to incinerate the world.

Seven Slaughtering Fists—Resonance!

Lin Yun laughed as he finally vented all his pent up emotions. This was why he was so formidable. After all, ordinary geniuses wouldn’t be able to brush off the negative emotions of this technique.

The wind from his punch blew the sea of flames back at Lin Tao. This sudden change caught Lin Tao by surprise. Since he wasn’t prepared, he was sent flying by his own attack and blood dripped from his lips.

Lin Tao’s face changed as he quickly stabilized himself. Then, he moved as fast as lightning to defend himself from Lin Yun’s attack with his own attack. He manifested meteorites that rained down on Lin Yun. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Heart Connection, Spiritual Sword!

Lin Yun’s hair fluttered in the wind as he formed seals with his hands. His sword intent radiated brightly as he prepared to attack. Flicking his fingers, countless sword rays shot out.

Meteorites occupied one side of the Dragonsoaring Stage while sword rays filled the other side. When the spectators saw this, fear filled their hearts. After all, the clash was too terrifying.

The intensity of the clash was unprecedented and unmatched since the start of this banquet. Those who were defeated by Lin Yun were surprised. Clearly, they never expected that Lin Yun would be this strong without using his sword.

With another rumbling explosion, origin energy fluctuated out from Lin Tao and Lin Yun’s clash. When the dust settled down, everyone’s eyes were glued to Lin Yun.

“Haha, I never expected that a newly risen genius like you could force me to this point.” Lin Tao’s face was somewhat pathetic as his injuries weren’t light. He had already lost all hopes of being seeded. His face was dark as he snorted, “This is the end for you. Your outcome was determined from the start. I’m going to cripple you!”

Golden magma began to circulate around Lin Tao, turning his body into magma. Additionally, crimson lines squirmed on the surface of his body like an ancient spiritual array. At this moment, he was like a fire demon from hell. Everyone could see that Lin Tao pushed the Profound Yang Battle Physique to the limit. This move would definitely suppress Lin Yun.

Lin Yun didn’t say a word as fighting spirit blazed in his pupils. So what if Lin Tao was one of the seven elites? As a swordsman, he would never back down.
