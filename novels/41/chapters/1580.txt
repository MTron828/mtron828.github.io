Chapter 1581 - Big Brother

Flames of rage blazed within the black-clothed person’s pupils, and his terrifying killing aura surprised Lin Yun. This fellow looked like a sect’s disciple and didn’t look old. So, where did this person get such a notoriously terrifying aura from?

To have such a strong killing intent the moment there was a disagreement immediately made Lin Yun think of demonic cultivators.

“Sword Sect’s disciple?” The black-clothed man didn’t say a word, but his companion looked at Lin Yun with a smile.

“I am.” Lin Yun nodded.

“So you’re a Sword Sect’s disciple. It’s no wonder why you grasped the Firmament Sword Intent at such a young age. I’m Mo Yun, and this is my friend, Dong An. Brother, how do I address you?” Mo Yun smiled.

“Uh… Xiao Yun.” Lin Yun initially planned to report his name, but he changed his name in the end.

“Haha, so it’s Brother Xiao. I’ll not beat around the bush, then. You must be after the Tiger King Bone, right? We can give up on it, but what can you give in exchange?” Mo Yun smiled.

Wearing an awkward smile, Lin Yun replied, “I’m actually not after the Tiger King Bone. What do you guys want, then.”

“I feel that your head is pretty good.” Mu Yun smiled eerily. As he waved his hand, saint runes rained down and instantly formed into three spiritual arrays enveloping this space. Lin Yun soon noticed that his sword intent was isolated from the world. Not only that, but even the circulation of his dragon origin became difficult.

“Saint spiritualist? You’re from the Profound Valley?” Lin Yun long knew that the other party was trying to drag time, and the arrays he set up were pretty impressive to create twenty thousand saint runes so quickly. Aside from Profound Valley’s disciples, he couldn’t think of who else could have such skill.

“Go to hell! Sword Sect’s disciple, you’re pretty foolish!” Dong An’s eyes flashed with mockery. A swordsman who had just reached the Dragon Pulse Realm dared to snatch the Tiger King Bone from him? Who gave him the confidence to do so? Did this person really think that no one dares to touch the Sword Sect’s disciples?

As Firmament Blade Intent exploded from Dong An, a boundless blade aura swept over that suppressed Lin Yun’s sword aura entirely, and a radiant sword ray immediately filled Lin Yun’s sight. But Lin Yun didn’t move. He didn’t even draw his sword and allowed Dong An’s blade to fly over.

“Courting death?” Dong An was puzzled, and Mo Yun’s eyes began to flicker because they didn’t know what Lin Yun was doing. While the two were puzzled, Lin Yun finally moved. Or rather, the black cat on his shoulder moved, turning into a blur, and a dagger appeared in its paw as it pounced at Dong An.

“Get lost!” Dong An was shocked before he took a step back and lost it. He retracted his blade before swinging it at Lil’ Red with even more power.

When the dagger and blade came in contact, Lil’ Red gave a shove, and Dong An was sent flying back with his right hand becoming numb. He couldn’t believe that he had actually lost to a cat in terms of strength.

“How is this possible?!” Mo Yun’s face changed.

“I already said my cat doesn’t have a good temper.” A chilling light flashed across Lin Yun’s pupils as he stomped his foot on the ground, destroying the three-layered spiritual array as he charged at Mo Yun.

Lin Yun’s speed made Mo Yun’s heart sink. But since he couldn’t follow Lin Yun’s speed, he might as well not see with his eyes. With a wave of his hand, multiple paintings appeared behind him, unleashing various phenomena. There was a sea of flames, a blazing sun, lightning, ferocious beasts… a total of eighteen saint diagrams, and each was comparable to a ghost spirit martial technique.

“Still not admitting that you’re a saint spiritualist from the Profound Valley?” Lin Yun paused and retreated as sword rays flew out when he swung his hand.

“Hmph, that’s not something you should be asking!” Mo Yun roared, and the eighteen saint diagrams engulfed Lin Yun. Let’s not mention someone who had just reached the Dragon Pulse Realm, even Mu Xueqin would be heavily injured when facing such attacks.

“Profound!” Lin Yun smiled as he pushed a ‘profound’ word out with his hand. As profound light exploded, it was like a gate that sent the eighteen saint diagrams back.

“What the…?” Mo Yun’s face turned pale upon seeing this, and he cursed. How the hell was he going to block this attack? Wasn’t this the same as cheating?

But he didn’t have much time to think because Lin Yun had returned his attack to him. When the saint diagrams flew over, a series of explosions echoed with various phenomenons overlapping.

“Mo Yun!” Dong An’s face changed when he saw this scene. But a black blur charged over just when he wanted to make a move. This time, Lil’ Red wasn’t using the dagger, but used its claws instead. The claws easily tore through the dragon origin around Dong An, causing Dong An’s lips to twitch as he retreated. He no longer dared to belittle this cat anymore.

“Bravo, Lord Cat!” The Demonic Rune Tiger cheered.

A bizarre flute song echoed right then as two powerful auras swept over. Lin Yun glared at the Demonic Rune Tiger, “Why are you still standing here?”

The Demonic Rune Tiger came to its senses, transformed back to its tiger form, and started bolting into the woods. Pushing its speed to the limit, its speed wasn’t any slower than Lin Yun’s movement technique. But it let out a groan when he ran. It felt like a mountain was crashing down on it.

Lin Yun went on its back and Lil’ Red stood on its neck. But the Demonic Rune Tiger didn’t dare to throw his temper and bolted off.

“Don’t chase them!” Mo Yun coughed, stopping Dong An from giving chase.

Right then, two figures descended from the sky. One was a man holding onto a bone flute, and the other was a purple-robed man with robust vitality. The purple-robed man asked, “Who’s that person?”

“I don’t know. He calls himself Xiao Yun, a Sword Sect’s disciple.” Mo Yun replied.

“He looks a little familiar.” The person holding the bone flute squinted his eyes as he looked at Lin Yun’s back figure. For some reason, he felt that that person was a little familiar.

“Sword Sect’s disciple!” The purple-robed man squinted his eyes, and the killing intent in his pupils rumbled. “Ha, he’s swift at running. Don’t care about him for now. For my tribulation, I need a droplet of the Black Tortoise’s Saint Blood.”

“My Tiger King Bone…” Dong An still wasn’t willing to give up.

“We can deal with him again after we’re done. No one can snatch anything from us, regardless if he’s a disciple of the Sword Sect!” The purple-clothed man said indifferently. Very quickly, the four of them disappeared.

When the Demonic Rune Tiger ran back to its den, it was exhausted while gasping for breath, “Lord Lin, Lord Cat, we should be safe now.”

“I didn’t expect you to be so fast. You’re not any slower than my movement technique.” Lin Yun smiled. When the Demonic Rune Tiger was running earlier, the surroundings became blurred. If it could travel in the thirty-six layers of heaven, he could consider taking the Demonic Rune Tiger as a mount.

“Lord Lin, you must be joking. How can I be compared to you and Lord Cat?” The Demonic Rune Tiger gasped for its breath. It was exhausted, but it didn’t dare to ask Lin Yun and Lil’ Red to get off its back.

With a smile, Lin Yun hopped off the tiger’s back. When Lil’ Red hopped down, the Demonic Rune Tiger ran over and smiled, “Lord Lin, why did you come to look for me?”

“The Withered Mountain Range is your territory. So I’d like to ask where you can find hundred-year ominous auras?” Lin Yun asked directly.

“Hundred year?” The Demonic Rune Tiger immediately became unhappy. “Lord Lin, are you looking down on this little tiger? How can hundred-year ominous auras match your identity? It has to be a thousand years at the very least. Leave this to me. I’ll make sure to ask around for you.”

Lin Yun was teased by the name the tiger gave for himself, but he soon asked, “How can thousand-year ominous auras be found so easily?”

“Lord Lin, it might not be easy for others, but this is my territory. I can ask my beast buddies, and I guarantee I can find news about them.” The Demonic Rune Tiger kept reassuring him. It naturally had to take a good opportunity of this since it could help Lin Yun.

Lin Yun couldn’t help smiling upon hearing the Demonic Rune Tiger’s words. But there didn’t seem to be any issue because Demonic Rune Tiger’s friends were really beasts.

He soon fell into deep thoughts. The Wind and Lightning Intents were still easy because thunderstorms could be considered natural to him thanks to his Azure Dragon Saint Physique. The Azure Dragon grasps thunderstorms, so Lin Yun didn’t have to practice these two martial intents. This meant that he needed to look for ice and fire-attributed ominous auras. Then again, it was naturally good if he could search for thousand-year wind and lightning ominous auras.

“Alright, we’ll go with that.” Lin Yun replied.

“Okay, I’ll get it done immediately!” The Demonic Rune Tiger’s movement was swift, wanting to leave.

“Come back.” Lin Yun called out to the Demonic Rune Tiger. “What’s the matter with those people?”

“I’m not too sure about that. They must be demonic cultivators. Recently, many monarch demonic beasts fell into their hands. I thought I had hidden well, but they still found me.” The Demonic Rune Tiger said with lingering fear. “If not for Lord Lin, I’d probably be dead by now.”

“Demonic cultivators?”

“Yeah. They didn’t even place powerful sect disciples in their eyes.”

“Are there disciples of my Sword Sect?”

“There are.” The Demonic Rune Tiger replied.

Lin Yun’s face changed with a chill flashing through his pupils. He could roughly guess their identity now, and they’re really bold to be so close to the Sword Sect. It wouldn’t take half a day to rush over from the Sword Sect, and they still dare to kill Sword Sect’s disciples?

They must be the rebellious disciples that Mu Xueqin spoke of, and he shouldn’t have left earlier because this meant that any Sword Sect disciple running into them would be in deep trouble.

“Don’t dwell on it too much. If you didn’t leave earlier, you might not be able to leave, then.” Lil’ Purple said as she flew out from the sword box.

“Don’t be so sure about that. I'll deal with them when I’m done refining the ominous auras myself.” Lin Yun said. His gaze became gentle when he looked at Lil’ Red, “You’re also in the Dragon Pulse Realm, and the Demonic Rune Tiger’s bloodline is weaker than yours. So why can’t you speak?”

“Hmph, why do you think it doesn’t know how to speak?” Lil’ Purple rolled her eyes.

“It knows how to speak?” Lin Yun’s eyes lit up, and he rejoiced, “I should’ve thought of it much earlier!”Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“What are you thinking about? Lil’ Red just doesn’t want to talk to you.” Lil’ Purple pouted.

“So you secretly learned how to speak? Try speaking.” Lin Yun said, looking at Lil’ Red.

“M-Master…” Lil’ Red shuttered.

But Lil’ Purple patted its head and said, “Call him scumbag!”

“Get lost!” Lin Yun knocked on Lil’ Purple’s head and smiled, “You can just call me big brother.”

Mustering its courage, Lil’ Red said, “Big Brother Scumbag.”

Hearing that, Lil’ Purple, who was baring her teeth, suddenly burst into laughter.
