Chapter 500 - Sword Singing Highly

Lin Yun’s arrogant words left everyone stunned. But shortly after, they began to smile with disdain. The Threesolute Manor’s Han Fei barked, “Flower Burial? Who the hell do you think you are? Get lost!”

He would’ve already attacked if Lin Yun’s previous attack wasn’t so powerful.

“Interesting. Did you think that you’re invincible because you made Leng Yi suffer a loss? Who the hell do you think you are?” barked Nie Feng with his brows frowned.

“You’re courting death!” Ye Cangming attacked straightaway. When he swung his sword, he created a crimson ray that was accompanied by a powerful gale while dashing at Lin Yun.

“The Bloodcloud Sword Art!” This attack made Pan Yue and everyone else shocked. There was no doubt that Ye Cangming was stronger than them. With his Bloodcloud Sword Art combined with his quasi-xiantian sword intent, the explosive power was unimaginable.

Regardless if it was Pan Yue or the others from the quasi-overlord forces, they were all filled with fear for Ye Cangming. If they had to fight Ye Cangming, then they could only use their advantage in numbers.

Ye Cangming’s sword soared through the horizon like a crimson bolt of lightning as his sword intent made the surrounding air tremble.

“Attack!” Pan Yue and Leng Yi also launched their attacks. They were unhappy with Lin Yun to begin with, so they naturally wouldn’t let such a good opportunity go.

“Let’s deal with this fellow first. A mere quasi-Violet Palace Realm dares to be so arrogant? He must be courting death!”

“I share the same thoughts.” Nie Feng and Han Fei both sneered. They drew their weapons and attacked Lin Yun. With that, the five strongest in the Indigocloud Lake all launched their attacks at Lin Yun at the same time. The situation was dangerous and this scene made the faces of the Heavenly Province Academy’s disciples change.

“Senior Sister, what should we do?” Bai Yi had concern on her face. Lin Yun’s Great Wind Scripture had shocked everyone and it also allowed him to catch up with Pan Yue and the rest. However, no one had expected that the five of them would attack Lin Yun together. One must know that Lin Yun was only in the quasi-Violet Palace Realm.

Liu Yunyan wore a bitter smile because she had no idea what was going through Lin Yun’s mind. The one who stands out will be targeted by everyone, doesn’t he know that? But she had a feeling that Lin Yun must have confidence for doing so. She replied, “Let’s deal with these demonic beasts first.”

“Alright, I’ll play with you guys then.” Lin Yun was unusually calm at this moment. The Bloodcloud Sword Art? Let’s stop that first.

Looking at the crimson sword combined with quasi-xiantian sword intent that was about to descend, Lin Yun shook his head inwardly. How would these people feel if he summoned his xiantian sword intent?

With both his hands behind him, Lin Yun wore a smile as the Flower Burial Sword shot out from the sword box. When Lin Yun held onto the sword, a strong confidence filled his heart and his blood started to boil.

“He’s not going to dodge?” Ye Cangming wore a sinister smile. No one within the same cultivation as him could block this move that combined the Bloodcloud Sword Art and his quasi-xiantian sword intent. However, Lin Yun was actually not going to dodge his attack. He really didn’t know if Lin Yun was impudent or if he was simply too arrogant. In his mind, since Lin Yun was courting death, he could just die.

“Why should I dodge such a weak attack?” smiled Lin Yun. When he drew out his sword, it shined like a bright moon reflecting on the surface of the lake. He was unleashing the Luminous Moon of the Aquaselenic Sword.

In the next second, a silvery sword ray shot out from Lin Yun’s sword. In front of this sword ray, everything else was dim in comparison. Lin Yun was completely different with his sword. When the two sword rays clashed together, the crimson ray that everyone was fearful about actually began to crumble.

This made Ye Cangming’s face turn ugly as his hand trembled violently. It felt as though he was about to lose control of his sword.

“This…” Everyone was shocked by this scene. This time, Lin Yun’s attack was a lot stronger than the Great Wind Scripture that he used previously. They were all shocked by how Lin Yun destroyed Ye Cangming’s attack with a sword.

In front of the bright moon, Ye Cangming’s quasi-xiantian sword intent was nothing. Everyone was baffled by Lin Yun because they had no idea how he did this.

Right at this moment, a chilling aura swept over as Pan Yue and Leng Yi had arrived. Lin Yun’s face sank when he saw the two and he snorted, “Great!”

Looking at the two of them, Lin Yun unleashed his second attack, Myriad Frost. This sword could freeze everything in its path. Before Pan Yue and Leng Yi could approach, they threw up a mouthful of blood and were sent flying. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Lin Yun first defeated Ye Cangming with the Luminous Sword, then Pan Yue and Leng Yi with the Myriad Frost. Right now, Lin Yun had no concerns about revealing all his strength. Especially since his strength had shocked everyone present. His strength had left many people’s hearts trembling. At this moment, they finally knew why he dared to speak such arrogant words from before.

“Let’s get him together!” roared Ye Cangming.

“Kill!” Pan Yue and Leng Yi both wiped the blood off their lips as they charged over once more. Even Han Fei and Nie Feng who were intending to stop also attacked with their teeth gnashed. They finally made it here and they didn’t want to give up on the Indigoflame Goldlotuses so easily.

Seeing the five of them charging at him, Lin Yun was feeling a little helpless in his heart. Were these people really unafraid of death? Couldn’t they tell that he was a lot stronger than them? He practiced the ancient Iris Sword Sutra, refined the three origins left by Guardian Plum, and also converted all his origin energy into sword energy. Furthermore, his Dracophant Battle Physique had reached the pinnacle.

He had surpassed the five of them with his origin energy and sword technique. The Aquaselenic Sword in Manifestation Stage was a lot stronger than the Bloodcloud Sword Art, not to mention that he even grasped the xiantian sword intent. Since they want a fight, then he would give it to them. He would let his sword sing as he beat them.

Closing his eyes, the Iris Flower in his dantian began to revolve as his silvery sword energy exploded like a volcano. Right at this moment, he was pushing the Iris Sword Sutra to the limit.

When he opened his eyes, they flickered like stars in the sky as his xiantian sword intent shot out. At the same time, a beautiful and ethereal sword buzz began to ring out from his body.

The moment the sword buzz rang out, it created water geysers on the lake that exploded like fireworks.

“Xiantian sword intent!” It was the complete xiantian sword intent. The moment they sensed it, the faces of Ye Cangming, Pan Yue, Leng Yi, Nie Feng, and Han Fei all changed. They instantly understood why Lin Yun was able to destroy Ye Cangming’s attack from before.

No matter how strong the quasi-xiantian sword intent was, how could it possibly be compared to the xiantain sword intent? It would be weird if Lin Yun’s attack didn’t overwhelm Ye Cangming. At the same time, they couldn’t help having fear rising in their hearts. Right at this moment, they no longer had any fighting spirit left. But could they really escape?

Thunderbolt Slash!

Lin Yun swung his sword out. His sword was like a colossal beast that charged at the five of them and before they could even react, they were devoured by Lin Yun’s sword ray. They were all sent flying with their bodies covered in wounds. Even the Indigocloud Lake was severed into two by Lin Yun’s sword.

When the lake water closed up the ravine created by Lin Yun’s sword, the five who were already heavily injured were sent flying out again by the tsunami. On the surface of the lake, everyone looked at the youth standing right there with their faces pale.

When everything calmed down, Lin Yun sheathed his sword and he boldly declared, “You guys have not humiliated your identities as elites from the various quasi-overlord forces since you guys can take an attack of mine and weren’t killed. Who hasn’t been underestimated in their lives as trash? I’m not an exception either. But remember, the one who defeated all five of you today is me, Flower Burial!”

Elites of the quasi-overlord forces? The five of them smiled bitterly as they were fully convinced by Lin Yun’s strength. Lin Yun’s words were a great humiliation to them. If Lin Yun was trash, then what were they?

But Lin Yun didn’t care about their bitter smiles as he dashed towards the Indigoflame Goldlotuses.
