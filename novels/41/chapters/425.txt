Chapter 426 - After the Champion

The Dragon Gate Plaza was heavily guarded by the Divine Guards and they would slay anyone who intruded. This was now a forbidden ground and it would only be opened on the day of the Dragon Gate Competition. At the center of the plaza was where everyone’s attention was drawn, the Dragon Gate Stage.

The Dragon Gate Stage was where one could transform into a dragon by getting into the top eight to become one of the titled figures. The stage was filled with an aged aura and there were a total of nine stands, and eight of the stands surrounded one stand. The one in the center was floating over the ground and was enveloped by a golden veil. Only the king could stand here.

The eight other stages were where the eight figures would be determined, and the one in the center would determine the champion. The champion would also become the king among the Great Qin Empire’s younger generation. This stage represented both honor and dreams because the king would be born here.

There was a throne placed at the center of the spectator platform that belonged to the Great Qin Empire’s monarch. But the throne looked as if it was competing with the king stage. If Qin Yu was the one who ultimately stood there, it would reflect on the throne, causing it to shine even more.

But if anyone else remained the last person standing there, it would appear as if the force behind him would be standing against the royal family’s authority.

When the light of dawn shined down, it expelled the coldness of winter. In an instant, the entire capital became heated. The plaza was surrounded by people. Not only were there citizens from the Great Qin Empire, but sects’ disciples and wandering cultivators from other territories were also here.

There were only three days left until the Dragon Gate Competition. Many cultivators who couldn’t obtain the qualification to participate could only watch the battle. There were also many inns around the plaza prepared for spectators.

The inns were filled with people because the Dragon Gate Competition was the grandest occasion in the Great Qin Empire.

“I heard that this Dragon Gate Competition will be the most intense one in the last century.”

“Yeah, too much weird stuff took place this year. First, there was Lin Yun, and now, we have Bai Lixuan who achieved the Saint Physique. The other sects also have other geniuses, but these things have never happened in the previous Dragon Gate Competitions.”

“Yeah, there are too many geniuses this time. Although everyone says that the seven titled figures are still confident about this Dragon Gate Competition, no one knows if there’s a darkhorse.”

“It’s mainly because of the Demonlotus Realm. The various sects’ disciples all received fortuitous encounters and they’ve been in seclusion ever since they returned. Who knows if any of them will shine in the competition.”

“Hehe, I’m actually more curious if Lin Yun will show up. His Highness’ face was green the other day when Lin Yun stopped the wedding. I bet His Highness has never received such a humiliation before in his life.”

“Lin Yun might be able to challenge the titled figures if he didn’t cripple a profound vein. After all, the potential he displayed was too terrifying.”

“Yeah, it’s really a pity. But even so, he shouldn’t have appeared at the wedding and revealed all his trump cards. Even if he can’t fight with a titled figure, he still has a high chance of obtaining the quota.”

“I would leave if I was Lin Yun. Let Qin Yu die of frustration of not being able to take revenge.”

The moment someone mentioned Lin Yun, they naturally discussed the bet in the Myriad Treasure Pavilion. The Myriad Treasure Pavilion had also become famous through this Dragon Gate Competition by introducing the Newly Risen Ranking and Titled Ranking.

Although the rankings were somewhat biased, it was still generally fair. If it wasn’t for the Newly Risen Ranking, it wouldn’t be possible for them to monopolize most of the bets for this Dragon Gate Competition because the ranking also represented their powerful intelligence.

When the sun set, the Sword Firmament Pavilion became bleak as disciples made their way to the capital. Naturally, they wouldn’t miss this event.

After all, they wouldn't be able to make it for the Dragon Gate Competition’s opening if they didn’t move out now. Some of the more anxious disciples left much earlier. However, even until today, Lin Yun was still nowhere to be seen, which disappointed many people.

Many feel that he might be giving up on this Dragon Gate Competition. They might be disappointed, but it was also understandable. After all, they might make the same choice if they were in Lin Yun’s shoes.

The Locket Mountain was gathered together and everyone showed concern on their faces, except for Xin Yan.

“Xin Yan, are we still waiting for junior brother?” asked Chen Xuanjun. There’s only three days left, but Lin Yun is still nowhere to be seen.

“Could it be that junior brother went to the core of the Extermination Mountain Range? I heard that it was the territory for Violet Palace Realm demonic beasts and there were even forbidden grounds there. Every year, many disciples go there and die…” said someone with a concerned tone.

“What are you talking about?” Xin Yan glared at the group as she sighed inwardly. Lin Yun really didn’t allow her to have a moment of peace.

“Senior Sister, do you think Big Brother Lin will head to the capital directly from the Extermination Mountain Range? After all, time is precious to him,” said Li Wuyou.

“Let’s hope so. We’re not going to wait for him any longer, let’s get going,” smiled Xin Yan as she rubbed Li Wuyou’s head. But before they left, Xin Yan turned back to look at the Extermination Mountain Range. She was really worried that Lin Yun might miss the time.

Meanwhile, a lone figure stood on a cliff as he looked at the setting sun in the core of the Extermination Mountain Range. It was naturally Lin Yun and he had been standing there ever since he made a breakthrough in the Dracophant Battle Physique.

He had been looking at the sun rising and setting for the past seven days, and he gradually saw something different about it. The sun might be moving slowly in his eyes, but it was actually traveling millions and millions of miles every second.

The Seven Profound Steps was derived from the Divine Sunchasing Art. It was impossible for humans to chase after the sun, so it didn’t mean chasing after it literally, but becoming the sun.

Since people managed to create the Divine Sunchasing Art in ancient times, this meant that there must be something special about it. After all, it made no sense for someone to chase after the sun blindly.

Lin Yun’s eyes lit up as he gradually calmed down and then he closed his eyes.

One night passed and Lin Yun suddenly opened his eyes when the first glimpse of dawn had arrived. When he turned around and took a step forward, he looked back to see another him standing in the place where he was previously.

When his clone basked in the sun, it suddenly glowed brightly, which seemed to form a painting. With a smile, Lin Yun stepped forward and he poked the painting.

The painting suddenly shattered and his clone turned into a lump of flames that soared into the sky. At this moment, his Seven Profound Steps reached the Manifestation Stage.

The rising flame was like a sun in the sky and many cultivators who were training in the mountain range looked at the direction of the sun with disbelief, “How is that possible…?”

Many intelligent demonic beasts were terrified as they had no idea what was happening. This instantly caused an uproar in the mountain range.

Lin Yun narrowed his eyes into slits and he balled his fists together with a ball of fire blazing deep in his heart. Three years was too long and he didn’t want to wait. He had a reason to attend this Dragon Gate Competition and he wouldn’t accept anything less than becoming the champion!
