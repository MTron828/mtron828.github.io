Chapter 1299 - What Heaven-Defying Luck

Lin Yun was extremely happy on the altar, and he would be laughing out loud by now if he wasn’t bearing it. The harvest was beyond his imagination. Not only did he obtain close to four million Divine Astral Pellets, but Lil’ Red had also obtained all sorts of harvests. Even if they couldn’t use them, they could exchange them for other resources, not to mention the Dragon Saint Pellet and quasi-saint origin.

The harvest was so huge that even a transcendent genius would rejoice if they were in his position.

“What should I do with the quasi-saint origin?” Lin Yun asked. This was an unexpected surprise because he only planned to obtain Divine Astral Pellets here, so he didn’t expect to obtain the quasi-saint origin. Even if there were treasures, he was only expecting secret treasures or saint artifacts, but even those wouldn’t make his emotions fluctuate.

But the quasi-saint origin was completely different. Not only did it contain the quasi-saint’s cultivation, but also the quasi-saint’s comprehension of the martial path and even some fragments of memories. This meant that he might be able to come in contact with secrets from ancient times to expand his eyesight. On the other hand, strengthening his foundation wasn’t as important when compared to that.

“Wait till you reach the Elysium Core Realm. You can only refine 30% of it at most with your current cultivation.” Lil’ Purple suggested.

Lin Yun nodded his head and agreed with her. Anyhow, he also wasn’t in a hurry to refine it. But if it was Xia Yunzhen, Fang Muyang, and Ye Xun, they would be a lot more anxious because they were in the Elysium Core Realm, and refining it would greatly boost their cultivation, allowing them to undergo a drastic transformation.

“What about the Dragon Saint Pellet?” Lin Yun asked.

“You really have a lot of questions.” Lil’ Purple became unhappy when Lin Yun mentioned the Dragon Saint Pellet. After all, they clearly could’ve gotten more from the white-haired youth, but Lin Yun just had to ruin it. “I suggest you give it to that azure dragon. You no longer have the Azure Dragon King’s divine rune, so the Azure Dragon Saint Art isn’t perfect. That azure dragon requires all sorts of resources to nourish it or it won’t be as strong as its dragon aura.”

Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts when he heard that. The azure dragon manifested by the purple-golden dragon runes was strong enough, but it was in a disadvantageous position when it faced Bai Luli’s constellation back then. If he didn’t empower it with his sword intent, the azure dragon might have even lost to Bai Luli and be torn apart by the latter’s constellation.

“The true dragon spirit contained in the Dragon Saint Pellet can allow the azure dragon to give birth to a spirit. Aside from that, the pellet still contains a lot of dragon blood and dragon flames that can greatly nourish the azure dragon. The increase in strength of the azure dragon can nourish your physique. So the benefit of letting it refine the Dragon Saint Pellet is a lot higher,” said Lil’ Purple, and her words made Lin Yun’s eyes light up.

If that was the case, then this meant that the strength of the azure dragon would greatly increase, and the potential was a lot higher than he had imagined.

“Where did that Xiao Fan exit from?” Lin Yun could sense that the altar was on the verge of collapsing while he stood on it. There were already cracks spreading out. If the ancient spiritual runes on it burst, it would unleash a terrifying shockwave of energy, so he knew that it was time for him to leave.

“I don’t know. Maybe he had other means to leave. Let’s just head back from where we came from,” said Lil’ Purple. She didn’t clearly see how that person left. That person was in a hurry and left the moment he took the pendant.

“Then, let’s go.” Lin Yun called out to Lil’ Purple and Lil’ Red before forming a seal and a pair of golden wings unfolded on his back.

Right at that moment, a group of people rushed to the third level of the underground palace, led by Emerald Jade Manor’s Fang Muyang, Thunder Sect’s Xia Yunzhen, and Heavenly Blade Pavilion’s Ye Xun. They all had injuries on their bodies, and the casualties they suffered had reached nearly half of their party.

The three of them all wore grave expressions with their hearts tensed. But when they reached the third level and saw that this place was even more empty than the second level, they all had despair written on their faces.

“H-How is this possible? Why the hell is this place empty?!” Xia Yunzhen began to curse with his face distorted, and he even wanted to tear this underground palace apart right now.

Ye Xun coldly looked at Fang Muyang. He was so furious that he wanted to cut the bastard apart because they nearly died in the second level after listening to Fang Muyang. They had already paid such a great price, and they couldn’t even catch up to that silver-clothed youth. So how could he possibly bear it?

“What should we do now?” Ye Xun coldly asked.

“It’s not easy to obtain the quasi-saint origin, and you’ll be heavily injured if you’re not careful. Not to mention that he’s alone, so there’s no way he can resist the demonic aura head-on,” said Fang Muyang. His face was ugly because he was embarrassed twice, and this made him hate that silver-clothed youth deep to his bones.

The atmosphere in the palace was depressing, and the entire underground palace was shaking with fragments of rocks falling from above. They all knew that the underground palace was about to collapse. They were all transcendent geniuses from the eight strongest sects, but they were only secondary to the strongest batch of transcendent geniuses in the Ancient Barren Domain.

They all had a great chance of becoming saints in the future, and this meant that they had unlimited prospects. But what they suffered today made them feel greatly disappointed. The three of them worked together and they even brought so many elites over, but they could only return empty-handed, and they were completely defeated by a single person.

“There’s no way I, Xia Yunzhen, can take this lying down!” Xia Yunzhen gritted his teeth. “I don’t care who the hell he is! He has to hand over the Dragon Saint Pellet, no matter what, or I’ll show him the foundation of the Thunder Sect!”

He was practically determined to use the power of his sect to threaten Lin Yun, and it was rare for a transcendent genius like him to be forced to take this step.

“My Emerald Jade Manor also can’t take this lying down!” Fang Muyang’s face was also ugly. If anyone hated Lin Yun the most, it would naturally be him.

Although Ye Xun didn’t say a word, anyone could feel his emotions just from the killing aura he was releasing. As a transcendent genius from the Heavenly Blade Pavilion, no one has ever escaped from him the moment he leaked his killing aura.

Right at that moment, a dazzling golden light suddenly charged over from the altar and instantly scattered boundless golden light to every corner of this pavilion. Lin Yun was wearing the Silver Moon Mask, and the length of his silver hair had reached his waist. So the gold and silver light made the three transcendent geniuses briefly stunned before they recovered from their shock.

They were shocked that Lin Yun had retrieved the quasi-saint origin so quickly. They had just reached the third level, and they were planning to briefly rest before heading to the last level. They all knew how terrifying the quasi-saint origin was, and they believed that it wouldn’t be easy for the silver-clothed youth to obtain it so quickly.

It was so much so that if he wasn’t careful, he would even lose his life on the fourth level. So they never expected that Lin Yun would be able to obtain the quasi-saint origin so smoothly and even look unharmed. This was simply too unbelievable.

“You obtained the quasi-saint origin?” Fang Muyang asked. But the moment he asked, he felt like a fool because it was pretty obvious. If Lin Yun hadn’t obtained the quasi-saint origin, would he take the initiative to leave?

“Yeah,” replied Lin Yun.

“What about the Dragon Saint Pellet?” Xia Yunzhen looked at Lin Yun with flames blazing in his pupils. He had a strong obsession for the Dragon Saint Pellet, far more so than the quasi-saint origin. That was a treasure of his dreams, and the value wasn’t inferior to the origin saint rune in his eyes.

“Well, things happened and I got it,” replied Lin Yun.

When Xia Yunzhen heard that, he nearly cursed out. Just what heaven-defying luck was that?

“Hand it over. Otherwise, there will be another soul under my blade,” said Ye Xun with his right hand on the hilt of his blade.

“It’ll sound about right if your senior brother, Nangong Ze, is the one saying that. But you? Forget about it.” Lin Yun coldly said. He had some impression of Nangong Ze, the transcendent genius of the Heavenly Blade Pavilion. Ye Xun was a lot stronger than Bai Luli, but there was a huge gap between him and Nangong Ze. So Ye Xun didn’t have the qualifications to be arrogant before him.

“Who the hell do you think you are? You think you’re on the same level as my senior brother?” Ye Xun’s eyes flashed with a cold light. He realized that this person wasn’t just arrogant. His senior brother was a transcendent genius ranked in the top tenth on the Empyrean Ranking. So who did Lin Yun think he was to act like he was on the same level as his senior brother?

“Why waste time with him? If he’s not willing to hand it over, then we just have to kill him!” Xia Yunzhen had a fiery temper as he unleashed his lightning and flame intents with the talisman in his hand rising into the sky.

But right at that moment, violent energy suddenly exploded from the ground, and the altar that Lin Yun was standing on instantly collapsed. Shortly after, beams of light exploded from the ground that pierced through the underground palace.

Lin Yun raised his hands before him and retreated. At the same time, he knew that the altar down below had exploded. Shortly after, a series of explosions resounded with more levels of the underground palace being pierced. In just a split second, the pillar of light had already broken out from the underground palace and soared to the sky. The light had instantly captivated everyone’s attention within a myriad mile of radius.

“What’s going on?” The sudden explosion left Xia Yunzhen, Ye Xun, and Fang Muyang shocked. The surrounding energy fluctuations were so strong that they were having a hard time resisting them, even with their cultivation.

“The underground palace was pierced through?” Lin Yun raised his head and looked at the explosion that destroyed the altar and pierced through the entire underground palace. This had saved him the trouble and he turned into a streak of light, disappearing before the three transcendent geniuses in the blink of an eye.

“Quick, go after him! We can’t allow him to escape!” Xia Yunzhen, Fang Muyang, and Ye Xun’s faces changed. They couldn’t be bothered to preserve their strength anymore and brought out their full strength. Leaving the Dragon Saint Pellet and quasi-saint origin aside, just the sacrifices in the altars alone were enough for them to pursue Lin Yun, not to mention that they couldn’t afford to suffer this humiliation.
