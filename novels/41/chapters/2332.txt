Chapter 2333 - Divine Disciple

Wang Jue donned an azure robe, looking elegant. But he gave off a terrifying aura that instantly made him the center of attention.

“This person is a divine disciple of the Azure Divine Palace. The Azure Divine Palace is one of the most ancient forces in the universe, and even the Heavenly Sword Pavilion is pale when compared to it,” Xiong Tiannan whispered. Just the title of a divine disciple was enough to pressure everyone tremendously, and everyone’s faces became grave upon seeing Wang Jue.

Wang Jue was famous in the universe, to begin with. Even in the Azure Cloud Realm, many people heard of him. He was one of the more dazzling geniuses of this generation. The four chief disciples of the Azure Cloud Realm were inferior to him.

The Azure Divine Palace had seventy-two guards, all under the various divine disciples as servants. The four around Wang Jue were four guards known as Thunderhawk, Ghost Owl, Ray Serpent, and Heavenly Wood.

When the four guards saw the fear on everyone’s faces, they wore contemptuous expressions.

“Wang Jue, what are you doing here?” Bai Yu roared.

Thunderhawk, who was standing before Wang Jue, smiled, “We’re naturally here to borrow everyone’s dao fruits. We have long heard of them.”

When he said that, everyone’s faces changed because this was no different from openly snatching them.

“This is the territory of my Azure Cloud Realm, not your Azure Divine Palace.”

“Do you think that everyone is afraid of you?” The Azure Divine Palace might be famous, but everyone had obtained the dao fruits with incredible difficulty. So, why would they give it away?

The strongest of the Azure Cloud Realm, Mu Xiuhan, coldly said, “Wang Jue, you want to face the entire Azure Cloud Realm by yourself?”

Wang Jue began laughing upon hearing that. The four Azure Divine Guards around him wore mocking expressions.

Wang Jue sneered, “Don’t tell me that you think I’m on the same level as you since we’re on the Brandished Dragon Ranking, right? As a divine disciple, I’ll be bullying you into making a move against you.”

Mu Xiuhan’s face became pale, and a figure dashed over before he could speak. Xin Wuhen roared, “Wang Jue, let me face you!”

He had embarrassed himself against Xiong Tiannan and Lin Jiangxian earlier, so he naturally wanted to prove himself now. Or rather, he didn’t put Wang Jue in his eyes, not to mention it was rare to find an opponent like that. So even if he lost, he could boast that he had fought with Wang Jue, a divine disciple.

But Wang Jue sneered, “Consider it my loss to take another bat against someone like you.”

“What arrogance!” Xin Wuhen became furious after he was belittled. He refused to believe he couldn’t force Wang Jue into making a move. As long as Wang Jue made a move, it would be a massive bargain if he could last ten moves.

He executed his martial technique with the Great Yang Dao and a bright sun appeared. Seeing the flames on him, everyone’s eyes lit up at the sight of the Great Solar Fire. When flames ignited, the outline of the Great Solar Domain was formed. This was Wang Jue’s confidence to challenge Wang Jue.

But Wang Jue didn’t take a bat at him while the woman beside him sneered. This woman was one of the Azure Divine Guards, Ghost Owl. She dashed out and pushed her palm forth, shattering the golden radiance coming from Xin Wuhen.

This made Xin Wuhen groan as his face changed, and he took a few steps back.

“Great Solar Fire? What bullshit!” Ghost Owl said as she smiled. When crimson flames blazed in her eyes, a demonic aura spread. She was from the Demon Clan.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

This made Xin Wuhen feel aggrieved, and Ghost Owl appeared before he could say anything. This speed surprised Xin Wuhen, with a palm landing on his chest and the Great Solar Domain began to disperse.

Sent flying away, Xin Wuhen smashed against a boulder, his face becoming pale. On the other hand, a ghostly figure appeared behind the Ghost Owl. Behind the ghostly figure, nine flames looked deep and unfathomable.

With a wave of her hand, Ghost Owl dragged Xin Wuhen over and stepped on his chest. She roared, “Behave yourself and hand over the dao fruits!”

“I’ll give! I’ll give!” Xin Wuhen was terrified and quickly handed over his dao fruits. There were nine of them, six indigo and three silver.

“There isn’t even a Golden Dao Fruit, and yet you dare to call yourself a genius on the Brandished Dragon Ranking?” Ghost Owl waved her hand and handed the dao fruits to Wang Jue before sending Xin Wuhen flying away with a kick.

Everything occurred in a split second, and Xin Wuhen was heavily injured before everyone could respond.

Wang Jue looked at the Indigo Dao Fruits with contempt, but his complexion improved after seeing the Silver Dao Fruits.

Everyone from the Azure Cloud Realm was stumped as they looked at Ghost Owl with fear. Xin Wuhen might be ranked at the bottom of the Brandished Dragon Ranking, but he was still on the ranking. So they couldn’t believe that he was defeated in only three moves.

Bai Yu and Ao Jue took a deep breath, their faces becoming ugly. After all, Wang Jue had yet to make a move.

“This is the strength of those from the Azure Cloud Realm?” Ghost Owl sneered coldly, “If that’s the case, don’t go and embarrass yourselves when the Heavenly Barren Saint Mountain appears.”

“What arrogance!” A cold voice resounded as Bai Yu stood out. He continued, “You’re a mere Azure Divine Guard. Do you think there’s no one here capable of dealing with you guys?”

Bai Yu was one of the four chief disciples of the Azure Cloud Realm. His cultivation was at the sixth-stage Saint Lord and was famed for his cruelty. He was enveloped in a crimson baleful aura with a pressure spreading out.

Seeing Bai Yu, everyone’s eyes lit up. They might usually fear Bai Yu, but he was on the Azure Cloud Realm’s side this time. He had a powerful aura and was only half a step from reaching the seventh-stage Saint Lord.

“Finally, someone from the four chief disciples is standing out!”

“Bai Yu might be cruel, but at least he has some courage and won’t just cower upon seeing Wang Jue.”

“With Chief Bai making a move, it should be easy to deal with Ghost Owl.” Everyone from the Azure Cloud Realm looked over in high spirits, since no one wanted their dao fruits to be snatched from them.

Ghost Owl smiled, “You're not bad. If you’re willing to become our master’s servant, I believe our master won’t mind bringing you up the mountain.”

Wang Jue nodded, “You barely have the qualification to climb the mountain.”

Bai Yu’s face was dark. He had never been looked down upon in this manner before. Raising his brow, he said, “I’ll cripple your so-called Azure Divine Guards within three moves.”

“Hahaha!” Ghost Owl laughed and sneered, “Let’s talk after taking three moves from me!”

The moment she finished, a ghostly howl echoed and boundless purple miasma began to spread out, causing the entire Qilin Mountain to tremble.

Ghost Owl was swift as she appeared before Bai Yu in a flash. In the next moment, the ghostly figure also moved and nine flames began to revolve, causing the surrounding space to distort and an immense pressure was coming down.

Bai Yu’s face changed, and he summoned his constellation. Like a mountain, the crimson skeleton enveloped Bai Yu to block this attack. But in the next second, Ghost Owl attacked three times, each causing the surrounding space to tremble.

This surprised Bai Yu and the crimson skeleton manifested into three heads and six arms. Each arm wielded a Glory Saint Artifact with a crimson seal on Bai Yu’s forehead, making him look like a fiendgod.

When he executed the strongest martial technique of the Blood Bone Gate, he stabilized the situation and the crimson skeleton on him became even more realistic. A crimson domain formed when the weapons were brandished, allowing Bai Yu to stabilize the situation.

“Interesting… I’m becoming serious!” Ghost Owl’s eyes excitedly flashed as a black aura swept out of her body. That was one of the thirty-six Sovereign Daos, Death Dao!

They unleashed their most potent attacks and their fight became even more intense. The nine flames behind the ghostly figure began to spiral in reverse before it reached out with its palm; there were multiple divine runes on the palm.

“How is this possible?!” Bai Yu raised his head with fear reflected in his eyes.

“Touch of Death!” The Ghost Owl laughed, looking like a madman as she appeared to have become a ghost with thousands of vines piercing through the crimson skeleton armor with black light flashing in the wounds, containing Death Dao, making recovery impossible.

Ghost Owl laughed as she charged over, following up her attacks. In just ten moves, Bai Yu kneeled on the ground with blood bleeding from his seven orifices.

This made everyone in the Azure Cloud Realm take a deep breath, their faces becoming pale with fright. When they looked at the voluptuous Ghost Owl, they were so frightened that they took a few steps back.

“Someone like you is qualified to be a chief disciple?” Ghost Owl looked at Bai Yu and gave him a few slaps, causing Bai Yu to throw out blood with his teeth flying out. This left everyone from the Blood Bone Gate dumbfounded, since they had always been bullying others and not the other way around.

The Heavenly Sword Pavilion’s Chang Jun and Xi Ruo were so frightened that their legs trembled as they hid behind Lin Jiangxian.

Wu Yuhua was shocked, but soon asked, “Isn’t she a little too powerful?”

Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts and felt that Ghost Owl should be as strong as she appeared. The problem lay with the nine flames, which would form into a terrifying array.

“Stop! I’ll hand over the dao fruits!” Bai Yu screamed as he handed out all his dao fruits.

“That’s more like it!” Ghost Owl smiled as she received the dao fruits with a sweet smile, but her smile looked terrifying in the eyes of others.

“Silver?” Ghost Owl frowned. “It turns out that you’re also a piece of garbage.”

She refused them and sent Bai Yu flying away with a slap. Then, she raised her head and looked at Mu Xiuhan.

Mu Xiuhan’s face was pale, and he no longer had the arrogance he had before. He obediently handed over nine dao fruits.

“You dare call yourself the first of the Azure Cloud Realm? They’re all Silver Dao Fruits!” The Ghost Owl mocked and didn’t give Mu Xiuhan any face.

Mu Xiuhan clenched his fists but didn’t dare to refute and lowered his head, “My aptitude is poor.”

“Well, it’s not bad,” Ghost Owl said in a disappointed tone.

Suddenly, Xin Wuhen jumped out, and said, “Lord Ghost Owl, that person over there has Golden Dao Fruits. I saw them with my own eyes!”

The person Xin Wuhen pointed at was Lin Yun.
