Chapter 251 - Who’s Afraid of Who

Xia Tengfei might have a reputation, but his arrogance roused everyone’s unhappiness. Lin Lan of the Heavenly Qin Institute sneered, “My Heavenly Qin Institute’s Berserk Python Spear is perfect for fighting in a deathmatch.”

Lin Lan wasn’t only an elite from the Heavenly Qin Institute, but he was also a direct descendant of the Lin Clan. Naturally, having these two identities made him aloof. He was rarely outdone by anyone. His words were naturally directed at Xia Tengfei.

When their voices fell, the elites from the Heavenly Profound Sect and Demonic Moon Villa also stated their views successively. They also had their own pride, so they didn’t want to be outdone by anyone here.

As for the other disciples from the other sects, they might be elites from their own respective sects, but they were nothing compared to the four great sects. It was fortunate that the four great sects didn’t have many people, so they still had a chance to vie for the eight quotas.

“If no one objects, let’s begin the battle,” said Gao Yangyu.

Xia Tengfei and Lin Lan had no objections, so of course no one else would think otherwise.

Gao Yangyu began to speak, “Alright, I hereby announce…”

“Hold your horses!” A voice came from outside the martial field just as Gao Yangyu was about to announce the start of the battle. Everyone immediately directed their attention over with locked brows.

Gao Yangyu was also shocked. The newcomer was only in the initial third stage of the Profound Martial Realm. He was walking over while carrying a sword box behind him and was dressed in the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s uniform.

This person was naturally Lin Yun. He came to Inkcloud City early, but he was held due to spending time on his cultivation. Everyone was already gathered when he arrived, so he naturally called out to interrupt Gao Yangyu.

“Sorry about that. I’m the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s Lin Yun. I’m sorry for arriving late.” Lin Yun cupped his hands together to apologize.

Gao Yangyu didn’t know what was wrong with the Sword Firmament Pavilion. Not only did they send someone with a low cultivation, but this person even interrupted his words. With that, his impression of Lin Yun immediately fell.

The representatives from the four great sects were all in the fourth stage of the Profound Martial Realm. The other sects even sent fifth stage disciples. The Bloodbone Forest wasn’t a walk in the park and there would be dangerous demonic beasts along the way.

Yet, they only sent someone in the third stage of the Profound Martial Realm over? Gao Yangyu felt that Lin Yun wouldn’t even be able to protect himself. But since Lin Yun was someone from the Sword Firmament Pavilion, Gao Yangyu didn’t dare to offend the latter. He smiled, “You’re late. We’re already starting the battle.”

“Doesn’t the Sword Firmament Pavilion have anyone else? They actually sent a piece of trash in the third stage of the Profound Martial Realm to venture into the Bloodbone Forest? Are they looking down on the Gao Clan or are they looking down on everyone here?” Xia Tengfei sneered. But it wasn’t surprising since the Primal Origin Sect and Sword Firmament Pavilion’s conflicts were well known. Someone like Zuo Yun was rare.

“I know him.” Lin Lan suddenly interrupted, which attracted everyone’s attention.

“He’s the one who killed Wang Ning four months ago!” Lin Lan said with a cold flash in his eyes. His words were like a bomb, causing everyone to turn and look at Lin Yun. After all, that even had caused a great commotion. It had been a long time since anyone dared to kill a direct descendant of the prestigious clans.

Although the matter died down after four months, everyone immediately recalled it when they thought about it.

“So it’s him…”

“He doesn’t look impressive at all. Why is the Sword Firmament Pavilion trying to protect someone like him?”

“He’s pretty bold to leave the Sword Firmament Pavilion. Is he not afraid that the Wang Clan will assassinate him?”

“This fellow is known for being arrogant. He even dared to slap Flying Dragon General’s beloved daughter in the Myriad Treasure Pavilion. I’m afraid that he’s looking down on Patriarch Gao by coming late on purpose!” Lin Lan sneered.

The atmosphere immediately turned strange. Xia Tengfei and Lin Lan were both trying to make things difficult for Lin Yun, while the other disciples looked at this scene happily. It would be best if both sides fought and gave them more opportunities to obtain the eight quotas.

The rewards for this mission were rich and it even included first grade spiritual jades. Lin Yun did not have any expression on his face at the words that were thrown out. After all, no one would be happy about being ridiculed.

“If the two of you have any opinion about me, then we can just fight. There’s no need to hide needles in your words. Or are the disciples of the Primal Origin Sect and Heavenly Qin Institute only know how to run their mouth?” Lin Yun narrowed his eyes into slits as he gave the two a gentle smile.

Now that he had formed the third profound vein and attained the seventh stage in the Iris Sword Sutra, his power would multiply greatly with the Dragon-Tiger Fist. Even if the two joined forces, there was nothing that Lin Yun had to be afraid of. He didn’t have to bear this since he was also equipped with the Overlord Sword.

“You’re courting death!” Xia Tengfei and Lin Lan’s faces became dark as they stood up, unleashing their aura at Lin Yun.

Xia Tengfei had a burly figure since he cultivated the Dracophant Battle Physique. When he stood up, the dracophant power surged like a violent primordial beast that gave others great pressure.

Lin Lan waved his hand and stepped forward with a cold face, unleashing an eerie and terrifying explosive power. An azure origin energy circulated within his body. He was like a venomous python.

The two took three steps forward and sent out their pressure. They seem to have a rapport as they worked together. It seemed like they wanted to use their pressure to embarrass Lin Yun.

“What powerful aura… They’re truly worthy of being elites from the transcendent sects. This Lin Yun is truly arrogant to offend the two of them at the same time. I’m afraid that he will only suffer in the end.”

“Obviously. Xia Tengfei and Lin Lan are both in the fourth stage of the Profound Martial Realm. Not even fifth stages like us would be able to fight against them. Lin Yun is only in the initial third stage of the Profound Martial Realm.”

“Xia Tengfei is especially strong. He has a deep attainment in the Dracophant Battle Physique that gives him fifty thousand kilograms of strength. If Lin Yun isn’t careful, he might even get himself torn into pieces.”

“Well, I actually hope that Lin Yun has some strength. It might benefit us.”

“I’m just talking about it randomly. Who would take this seriously?” Everyone discussed among themselves and hoped that those three would fight. But just when the battle was about to break out, Gao Yangyu’s voice sounded out, “Can you guys give me some face here?”

Gao Yangyu wiped his sweat and his impression of Lin Yun hit rock bottom. The latter was simply a bastard, acting so arrogant despite being so weak. After all, he would be in trouble with the Sword Firmament Pavilion if Lin Yun was killed.

He had also experienced how intense the battle between the disciples was and it was worse than he had ever imagined. Xia Tengfei and Lin Lan were both stunned and they calmed down. In the end, this was the Gao Clan’s territory and the mission was also issued by Gao Yangyu. It was only natural that they gave him face.

Lin Yun was nothing and it would be embarrassing if they failed the mission. Xia Tengfei smiled, “Of course, we will give Patriarch Gao face, unlike someone who shows up late on purpose. After all, he’s just a piece of garbage that I can deal with anytime I want.”

At the same time, Lin Lan spread his arms apart and returned to his seat. He had used a high graded movement technique, which made everyone’s eyes light up.

After he returned to his seat, Lin Lan said with a deep smile, “I’ll naturally give you face.”

Gao Yangyu felt relieved and turned his eyes over, “Little friend, it’s fine that you’re late. I’ll give an explanation to the Sword Firmament Pavilion and the sect probably won’t blame you for it.” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“I’m not late since the quota isn’t fixed.” Lin Yun smiled.

“You!” Gao Yangyu was furious as Lin Yun was too much. He was kind enough to give Lin Yun a way out, but the latter insisted on participating. “Lin Yun, there are no rules in the deathmatch and you might not be able to retreat once it starts.”

“That’s even better. After all, the demonic beasts in the Bloodbone Forest won’t follow any rules.” Lin Yun stretched his arm out to stop Gao Yangyu from continuing. “Since the battle hasn’t started, then please include me in it. This mission is important to me.”

After all, the mission would reward him with second grade spiritual jades. He didn’t want to give up no matter what.

“Patriarch Gao, since Brother Lin is so insistent, then why bother rejecting? Why don’t you let him participate?” Lin Lan smiled as he took a sip of the tea. Earlier, Gao Yangyu was afraid that they would kill Lin Yuu. Lin Lan had noticed this. He considered Lin Yun lucky to have encountered Gao Yangyu, who didn’t want any trouble.

But he never imagined that Lin Yun would be so insistent on joining. To him, Lin Yun was simply courting death. Xia Tengfei smiled, “Patriarch Gao, it’ll be wrong if we reject him. After all, if he goes back to the sect and reports that, it’ll turn into you looking down on the Sword Firmament Pavilion. Hehe, it’ll be troublesome for you at that time.”

The two were trying to force Lin Yun onto the stage so that they could trample him out in the open. Gao Yangyu’s face changed. When he saw that Lin Yun showed no signs of retreating, he replied in an unhappy tone, “Since you’re being so stubborn, I won’t say anything else. Everyone here can witness that I’m not responsible if anything happens to you.”

“Of course you aren’t.” Lin Yun replied calmly. When Xia Tengfei and Lin Lan heard his words, their eyes flashed with a cold light. But everyone present failed to notice that there was a slight smirk on Lin Yun’s face.
