Chapter 1864 - Who's Not A Genius?

As the wind blew, waves rose on the rumbling ocean with an ancient and powerful aura sweeping out. When they swept towards Zhuge Qingyun, fine cracks appeared on the seven wheels that he had just regathered.

“Profound Sky Canon—Golden Wheel Seal!” Zhuge Qingyun’s lip twitched, and his hand signs changed, pushing his palm forth before the waves nearly consumed him. A hundred-foot golden wheel flew out, with an altar beneath the wheel, and the altar had saint runes intertwined on it.

The golden wheel from the middle split the ocean open as it flew towards Yue Weiwei. As Yue Weiwei danced in the air, the red ribbons flew over and collided with the golden wheel.

But in the next moment, Zhuge Qingyun had already charged forth. He was fast, even though he had just lost ten years of his cultivation. He no longer looked as domineering as when he defeated five Quasi-Saints, but he was still a Quasi-Saint. When he stepped on the red ribbons, he immediately felt great pressure. He could sense a power within Yue Weiwei that didn’t belong to her.

“Lass, you shouldn’t be involved in this, regardless of your background. Get lost!” Zhuge Qingyun clasped his hands together, and the pressure he felt disappeared. He then pushed his palm forth, immediately destroying the red ribbons.

Tearing apart the red ribbons, he arrived before Yue Weiwei in the blink of an eye. But right then, a melodious flute music that sounded like it came from the sky turned into ribbons that coiled around Yue Weiwei.

While Yue Weiwei was accompanied by the flute music, she was soon immersed in it, resolving Zhuge Qingyun’s attacks. At the same time, those ribbons coiled around her. But everyone soon realized that Yue Weiwei’s celestial aura had gradually become dense, and the aura she gave off exploded.

“It’s really beautiful!”

“This is the legendary Ni Chang Dress Song?”

“It’s really unbelievable… The phenomenon looks so realistic.” The dress looked really beautiful on her, but it looked unrealistic because it was too beautiful. When the dress was formed, Yue Weiwei raised her hand, and the red ribbons easily forced Zhuge Qingyun to retreat.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Yue Weiwei stepped in mid-air, and her movements were like a celestial dancing in the sky. As Yue Weiwei danced, silver sparks gushed out from her body, “Silver Spark Tree!”

When she reached out with her right hand, a flash of sharpness flashed within her pupils, and she gently pushed forth. Silver fireworks bloomed in the sky, and silver flowers began to bloom. The sunlight that shone down from the sky merged with her like layers of water screens, and she passed through the layers of water screens.

When she passed through the first layer, she looked even more beautiful. After she passed through all nine layers, the mark on her forehead looked even more bewitching. This changed Zhuge Qingyun’s face, and he unleashed a barrage of attacks.

Zhuge Qignyun even resorted to summoning his constellation, but all his means were futile. When Yue Weiwei’s palm landed on Zhuge Qingyun, fine cracks appeared on the saint aura around him.

Everything looked like it was in slow motion as Zhuge Qingyun was pushed back, smashing apart the silver flowers. He would throw out a mouthful of blood whenever he smashed through one.

“Not good…” Zhuge Qingyun was horrified to discover that his internal organs were planted with flowers that spouted within his body. Each of the flowers was beautiful, but they were slowly devouring him.

“This is the supreme secret technique of the Heavenly Demon Clan!” Zhuge Qingyun looked at Yue Weiwei, and the astonishment within his pupils couldn’t be concealed. He began to wonder about the origin of Yue Weiwei.

After Zhuge Qingyun flew out, Yue Weiwei began to spin in mid-air, and the speed of her rotations began to increase. The aura she occasionally released would cause waves to rise on the sea, leaving ripples in the surrounding air.

At the very end of it, even space began to distort as more Yue Weiweis began to appear, soon reaching a thousand Yue Weiweis. This was the scene of space breaking into multiple fragments, and Yue Weiwei was like flowing water moving through the fragments.

“H-How is this possible?!” All the spectators were shocked because not even a Quasi-Saint could cause such spatial fluctuations. Facing this, Zhuge Qingyun had beads of sweat dripping from his forehead.

His face turned pale, and he could not resist because he had nowhere to escape. Zhuge Qingyun was even more confused than everyone else because Yue Weiwei was everywhere.

“A dance like a lotus flower…” Yue Weiwei’s performance took aback Mei Zihua.

“This is the Profound Fairy that accompanied the young master under the Three-Lives Tree? She’s really beautiful…” An Liuyan’s eyes shone with splendor while looking at this scene.

When the layers of space overlapped, Yue Weiwei descended from the sky with the ribbons around her emitting a faint radiance. When she descended, the seal on her forehead bloomed, slowly lifting the seal within her body.

Under her palm, the seven wheels that Zhuge Qingyun summoned had all shattered, causing the latter to throw out a mouthful of blood, and he was sent a few hundred meters away with disbelief filling his pupils.

The power that he felt now was in contrast to the gentle push he had suffered earlier. But Zhuge Qingyun still gritted his teeth, unwilling to admit defeat, even if he barely held his front. Yue Weiwei's power wasn’t the Nine Profound Heavenly Dance, and it didn’t belong to her.

“Profound Sky Canon—Universal Reversal!” Zhuge Qingyun resorted to the same attack and nine colored radiances shone from his body with chaotic energy intertwining on his palm.

“Zhuge Qingyun, you’re finished!” A loud roar echoed from the Divine Phoenix Mountain’s Quasi-Saint, who had recovered. As he took the lead, the four other Quasi-Saints followed behind him and unleashed their constellations.

When the five Quasi-Saints joined forces, their powerful saint auras swept out, and Zhuge Qingyun’s attack was repelled before he could even unleash it. This made him throw out another mouthful of blood with his feet trembling. This time, the sun and moon within his pupils shattered.

Lin Yun soared to the sky with the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute in his hand and carried Yue Weiwei before they returned to the ocean.

Yue Weiwei raised her head to look at Lin Yun and smiled, “Weiwei has done it!”

But as soon as she finished, she closed her eyes and fell asleep. Lin Yun immediately examined her before he let out a breath of relief after realizing that her life wasn’t in danger.

At the same time, the battle in the sky had ended. Tens of thousands of suns were growing on the Mulberry Tree, and golden crows flew out from the sun. As countless golden crows flew out, the three Saint Lords kept retreating, with their bodies covered in injuries and their faces becoming pale.

“Saint Elder is really powerful, as rumored. We will leave today!” The leader of the three was unwilling, but he had no choice but to retreat.

Mu Xueling lowered her flute and descended to the ground. She looked at Yue Weiwei, who was in Lin Yun’s embrace with heartache in her pupils.

“If you dare let Weiwei down, I won’t let you off!” Mu Xueling glared at Lin Yun.

“Is she alright?” Lin Yun asked.

“That’s the Heavenly Demon Inheritance that my aunt left for her, but it’s still not time for her to use it yet. So she was forcefully using it.” Mu Xueling said furiously.

“I’m not convinced!” Zhuge Qingyun furiously roared with unwillingness filling his pupils. He was heavily injured and forced down on one knee under the pressure of five Quasi-Saints.

“Do you guys dare to fight me one on one?!” Zhuge Qingyun said, glaring at the five Quasi-Saints.

The Quasi-Saint of the Divine Phoenix Mountain roared, “A Quasi-Saint actually lowered himself to make a move against someone at the Profound Life Stage? Where do you get the face to demand one-on-one?”

Zhuge Qingyun was ashamed and furious at those words. His body trembled with anger, but he was powerless to refute. It was fine if he managed to kill Lin Yun. But not only did he fail, he even suffered heavy injuries from Lin Yun. This meant that he would become a joke after today. Others would only know him as a Quasi-Saint who was nearly killed by someone at the Profound Life Stage.

“Holy lands with ancient inheritance want to take advantage of numbers? Do you guys think that there is no one in the Ancient Barren Domain?” A sneer resounded. This voice wasn’t loud, but it was clearly heard by everyone.

When Lin Yun raised his head, he saw a lone boat slowly approaching, and a woman was drinking wine on the boat.

This changed Lin Yun’s face because this woman was the same person they met at the Black Tortoise Void Sea. But the white-clothed man was nowhere to be seen. Did that mean that the white-clothed man had lost?

“Who the hell are you? Get lost!” The Quasi-Saint of the Divine Phoenix Mountain furrowed his brows and pushed his palm forth, destroying the boat that the woman was on. But when his saint aura settled down, the woman was nowhere to be seen.

“Where’s she?” Everyone was puzzled, but Zhuge Qingyun’s eyes flickered as everyone else fell into deep thoughts.

While everyone was baffled, the ocean broke apart, with the woman soaring out of the ocean. When she soared out of the ocean, she raised the jar of wine in her right hand and took a huge mouthful of wine.

This scene had left everyone briefly stunned. The woman spun in mid-air and looked at the holy lands’ Quasi Saints. She smiled, “Do you guys think that the Ancient Barren Domain can be bullied, and the Profound Sky Sect has no Emperor? Who isn’t a genius?”

She soared to the sky, and her laughter spread out, causing heads to blow apart from the soundwaves alone. This scene left all the Quasi-Saints dumbfounded.

Mu Xueling’s face changed, and she raised her flute to her lips, playing a hurried and long musical score to resist the laughter.

When the woman turned around, her long hair scattered, and a flower bloomed on her shoulder. When everyone looked at the woman again, they were deeply shocked because the woman was Tian Xuanzi in disguise!
