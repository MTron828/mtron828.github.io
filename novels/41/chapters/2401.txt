Chapter 2402 - We Won't Bow If Emperor Doesn't Release Him

Luo Tianxi didn’t pick the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son or Ji Zhangkong, but Ji Zixi. This made everyone briefly stunned before they figured it out. After all, Ji Zixi was the Heavenly Phoenix Maiden, and anyone could realize her talent. Most importantly, she was also the youngest amongst the thirty people.

In terms of strength, she might be weaker than many of the people here. But no one here could compete with her in terms of potential.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Lin Yun was briefly stunned before he rejoiced with a smile. He initially wanted to use his request to ask the ancestral deity to take Ji Zixi as his disciple, but he could save it now.

“I’m willing!” Ji Zixi said, and she almost teared up.

For everyone on the stage, this was acceptable, but the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son questioned, “What gives?! How can she be compared to me? I can easily crush her with one finger!”

His gaze was vicious when he looked at Ji Zixi, scaring her into taking a few steps back.

“Why don’t you fight me? I won’t use my sword and will only use one hand against you.” Lin Yun stepped forth, pulling Ji Zixi to his back, looking at the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son coldly. Yue Weiwei and Lin Jiangxian also stepped forth, standing on both sides of Lin Yun, looking at the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son.

Everyone was briefly stunned before they came to their senses. Amongst the top ten, four were part of Lin Yun’s group.

“Holy shit, I didn’t realize it earlier, but their group is really strong.”

“A Heavenly Phoenix Maiden, a Heavenly Fragrance Divine Maiden, and a prodigy swordsman who grasped an Eternal Dao. They’re all unbelievably strong.”

“Honestly speaking, I feel that even Lin Jiangxian has a higher potential than the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son.”

“Where did he get the face from? Even if the ancestral deity was to pick another disciple, it would be Lin Jiangxian, even if it wasn’t Ji Zixi, and there was no room for him.”

“Why can’t he think about why the Heavenly Seal Emperor placed him as tenth?”

“He deserves to be humiliated by Lin Yun. Even if he was to tie his hands together, I reckon that he wouldn't dare to fight Lin Yun.”

The Heavenly Qilin Divine Son naturally heard the commotion in the surroundings, and was dumbfounded. After all, he was a popular candidate for the champion position, so he never expected to be reduced to this spot. Facing Lin Yun’s mockery, he didn’t dare to accept his challenge at all, which placed him in a difficult position.

“Heavenly Qilin Divine Son, this is a decision made by the ancestral deity, and even the sect master can’t do anything about it. With your talent, you will become a deity sooner or later, so there’s no need to be too concerned about it,” Feng Bumao said when Luo Tianxi gave him a look. This was the same as giving a step down for the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son.

The Heavenly Qilin Divine Son said, “I apologize for losing my composure earlier.”

“It’s fine. The fact that you can make it into the top ten is enough to prove your talent, not to mention that Qilin Mountain’s foundation isn’t weak, either. They just don’t have an Ancestral Stage expert. As a deity’s son, you don’t have to care much about resources, since it’s only a matter of time for you to become a deity.” Luo Tianxi naturally wouldn’t pursue that with his breadth of mind. He continued, “The banquet has ended, and the ancestral deity will erect the monument seven days from now. At that time, you guys can leave your names on it.”

“We’re grateful to the ancestral deity!” Everyone bowed, expressing their gratitude. No one lacked the resources of treasures since they came this far, but the monument erected by the ancestral deity was an excellent opportunity for them. According to the past, those with their names on it could smoothly become an Emperor since they were blessed by fortune.

The naked eye couldn’t see Fortune, but in a nutshell, they would receive protection from the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity, and those from the older generations weren’t allowed to make a move against them.

“Lin Yun, Dugu Jue, Yue Weiwei, and Ji Zixi, the four of you stay behind. Everyone else can leave since the ancestral deity will give everyone a lecture seven days from now. You guys can come at that time,” Luo Tianxi said. Everyone nodded, but they looked disappointed. That was especially the case for Bai Ye because he knew why those four were staying behind. The ancestral deity wanted to meet them.

Although a lecture from the ancestral deity was a rare opportunity, they could only see a blurred figure from afar and not the ancestral deity himself. This made Ji Zixi’s heart pumping with excitement and anxiety because she never expected that she could become the ancestral deity’s direct disciple. This meant that the Divine Phoenix Mountain had finally fulfilled their wish, which made her feel conflicted.

When she sneaked a peek at Lin Yun, she couldn’t help feeling bashful. It was all thanks to Lin Yun that she could come so far, and she didn’t know how she should repay him. But she immediately felt empty in her heart, thinking that Lin Yun was returning to the Kunlun Realm, and she didn’t know when they could meet again.

Yue Weiwei noticed Ji Zixi’s expression and wore a smile, holding onto her hand to comfort her.

“The battles might have ended, but the banquet will carry on. The Heavenly Saint Courtyard will continue to welcome guests for the next seven days, and everyone is welcome!” Luo Tianxi smiled as he looked around.

Everyone cupped their fists together and had to admit that Heaven’s Gate was really generous to provide an endless flow of spiritual wine and saint fruits. With that, the banquet ended with everyone’s face filled with excitement and unwillingness to leave.

“Come with me.” Luo Tianxi looked at the four, asking them to follow him. This made the four’s eyes, including Lin Yun, widen with excitement since they were going to meet the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity soon. After all, that was an Ancestral Stage expert!

Right then, Feng Bumao, Ye Wuhan, and others stood beneath the throne, looking at three black-robed figures who descended from the sky. The three figures hovered in the air like three bright suns on the stage, and their sudden appearance caused an uproar, with everyone getting on their feet. They had shock on their faces when they looked at the appearance of those three.

Those three all had a vast origin, and they were famous in the three thousand realms. The forces behind them weren’t inferior to Heaven’s Gate, especially the person in the middle. This person was the Dao Sect’s Dao Son, Feng Yuan. The Dao Sect was an immortal holy land, and they had an Ancestral Stage expert with forces comparable to Heaven’s Gate. There was no doubt that their Dao Sect had an unrivaled genius.

It wasn’t an understatement to call him the leader amongst the three thousand realms’ younger generation. Ye Wuhen was nurtured by Heaven’s Gate so that he could rival Feng Yuan when he became the divine son. The other two also had terrifying origins, since their talents weren’t any weaker than Feng Yuan's. They only lacked foundation since the forces behind them didn’t have an Ancestor Stage expert.

The one on the left was a white-clothed youth clad in dazzling saint radiance, wielding a fan. This young man was the Heavenly Sword Pavilion’s young master, Bai Yuchen. But he didn’t look like a swordsman. Instead, he looked more like an elegant gentleman.

The one on the right had a dark expression with light flashing in his eyes like the starry sky. He was the Shadow Divine Palace’s Divine Son, Jiang Yi.

“Why are they here?”

“A Dao Son, a Divine Son, and a Young Master. What a formidable array. This is a little terrifying.”

 “This is interesting. They’re probably here to take revenge. Do you guys know how many people Lin Yun killed on the ninth testing ground?”

“The three chief disciples from three forces, the Dao Sect’s Qin Yun, Heavenly Sword Pavilion’s Jiang Ziyao, and Shadow Divine Palace’s Heavenly Book, were killed by him.”

“There were already rumors that the three forces would come after Lin Yun, but I didn’t expect them to send the three of them.” The surrounding atmosphere became tense with whispers in the surroundings.

Lin Yun initially didn’t know the three of their identities, but he understood now after hearing the whispers. Yue Weiwei and Lin Jiangxian also came to their senses and stood beside Lin Yun. They have experienced multiple life and death situations together, and no one could imagine how good their relationship was at this point.

They wouldn’t take a step back, no matter who came. When Dugu Jue saw this scene, his lips twitched. He was envious of Lin Yun, who had treated him as a sparring partner. But he didn’t know that it would become his biggest honor in the future.

Many years from now, Dugu Jue would mention what happened at the Heavenly Barren Banquet and how he got a draw with Flower Burial. He would boast that he once had a draw with the Sword God.

The Heavenly Qilin Divine Son’s eyes lit up when he saw this scene, and even Ji Zhangkong was briefly stunned before he became excited. Ji Zhangkong could tell why the three were here, and he had difficulty holding back his laughter. But the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son couldn’t hold it back and started laughing because he knew Lin Yun was doomed.

Seeing these three people, Luo Tianxi frowned, and his smile became cold. All the ancestral deity’s disciples also looked at the three coldly. Feng Bumao roared, “The three of you intruded without reporting your names, and you’re not bowing to the Emperor? What are you guys trying to do?!”

Bai Yuchen and Jiang Yi didn’t move as they turned to look at Feng Yuan. This scene drew everyone’s unhappiness from Heaven’s Gate as they soared to the sky, releasing a powerful pressure that shattered the sky from their auras. No matter why these three were here, they were being disrespectful with their actions, and it had been a long time since anyone dared to be rude to Heaven’s Gate.

Feng Yuan looked at Feng Bumao before he turned to Luo Tianxi. He said, “We have no intention of becoming disrespectful to the Emperor, and our seniors informed us not to bow as long as the Emperor doesn’t release the person we’re here for to us. If you’re unhappy, you can feel free to kill us!”

An uproar broke out after everyone heard what Feng Yuan said.
