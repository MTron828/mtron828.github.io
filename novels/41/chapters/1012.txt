Chapter 1013 - Fight

The moment Lin Yun landed on the ground, he suppressed the shockwave within his body with his origin energy. Then, he stomped his foot on the ground and dashed forward like a golden beam, bombarding Mo Xuan with meteorite-like punches.

“You’re courting death!” Seeing that Lin Yun dared to charge at them, Han Lei’s face sank as he stabbed his sword towards Lin Yun.

“Watch out!” Pei Xue yelled as purple light began to flow out of her palm to help Lin Yun out. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Let him come over.” Lin Yun transmitted his voice to Pei Xue so she wouldn’t help out. After all, he didn’t even let Lil’ Red help him. Clearly, he wanted to test his strength after leaving the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm.

Han Lei’s sword was fast as his sword radiated with origin energy. The power of his attack surpassed the level of the fourth soul Heavenly Soul Realm geniuses from the higher realms.

Sensing this attack, Lin Yun’s face became grave. After all, the Profound Lightning Twin Swords weren’t pushovers. However, neither was he!

Flicking Divine Finger!

Lin Yun hovered in mid-air and flicked his finger, unleashing a sword ray to knock Han Lei’s sword away. When Han Lei’s sword curved from its path, it started vibrating from the impact. Instantly, a powerful sword intent exploded that nearly caused Han Lei to lose his sword. To negate the impact, he had to spin in mid-air.

Lin Yun didn’t follow up with another attack because Mo Xuan was already charging over with cold light in his eyes. The sword in his hand burst into lightning before manifesting into a lightning prison to envelop Lin Yun.

Within the prison, sparks flew around and caused the entire space to tremble violently. This was Mo Xuan’s ultimate move. Not only could it be used to trap his opponent, but he could also wear his opponent down.

However, Lin Yun didn’t move. Like a boulder, he allowed the lightning prison to shrink around him. When the prison was about to close, he threw a punch as his body radiated with golden light. Pushing the essence of the Divine Glorysun Fist to the limit, Lin Yun destroyed the tottering prison.

But when Lin Yun broke free of the lightning prison, Han Lei and Mo Xuan were already preparing their next attacks. Turning into two bolts of lightning, they unleashed a combo move that gave them the name Profound Lightning Twin Swords.

“Die!” The moment Lin Yun broke the prison apart, Han Lei and Mo Xuan’s attacks reached Lin Yun’s chest. Their swords unleashed a dazzling brilliance that spread throughout the nearby region and froze space itself.

The spectators were filled with fear from the sword rays that exploded in front of them. In their hearts, they rejoiced that they didn’t act rashly in the beginning. Otherwise, their corpses would be lying on the ground.

Just when everyone felt that Lin Yun would be reduced to a mist of blood, the shockwave from the attack broke the clouds apart. Han Lei and Mo Xuan’s swords were like firm mountains as they stood withstood the trembling of heaven and earth.

Unfortunately for them, Lin Yun was also standing still. With dragon armor enveloping his body, Lin Yun’s hair fluttered violently in the wind. At this moment, he was giving off a divine aura.

“This is impossible!” Han Lei and Mo Xuan narrowed their eyes because they couldn’t believe what was happening. They could tell that Lin Yun’s armor was a martial technique, but they couldn’t understand why it was so strong.

Not giving Han Lei and Mo Xuan the time to be shocked, a boundless dragon aura exploded from Lin Yun. His hand was currently enveloped in scales and lightning as slapped Han Lei and Mo Xuan with the back of his hand. Just like that, Han Lei and Mo Xuan fell from the sky and collided into the ground.

What in the world… Every single person’s mouth was wide open. Did he just send them flying with a slap?

At this moment, everyone was watching the azure figure descend from the sky.

In the next second, two figures soared into the sky from the massive crater. They were naturally Han Lei and Mo Xuan, but it was hard to tell since their faces were swollen and full of blood. Both of them gritted their teeth with terrifying killing intent gathered in their pupils.

After all, this was the greatest humiliation a forbidden existence like the Elysium Trigram War Realm had ever experienced. It was even more humiliating than death because the status of the Elysium Trigram War Realm was defamed. So no matter what, they had to kill Lin Yun to get back their dignity.

“Who are you?” Han Lei barked. Not only him, but even the audience was curious about Lin Yun’s identity. In the beginning, they thought that Lin Yun was courting death, but he clearly had the strength to be arrogant. For someone of his caliber, he definitely wasn’t a nobody in the Heavenly Path.

Finally thinking about my identity? Lin Yun wore a mocking smile underneath his hood. He had no intention of concealing his identity, so he removed his hood. “I’m Flower Burial Lin Yun.”

As soon as he revealed his appearance, the crowd saw a handsome but arrogant face with bright eyes.

“It’s you!” Han Lei and Mo Xuan’s faces both changed when they recognized Lin Yun. After all, who hadn’t heard of Lin Yun by now?

When Lin Yun revealed his identity, the crowd roared. They never expected that the hooded person would be Lin Yun. Then again, it made sense because they couldn’t think of anyone as arrogant as Lin Yun. Even if the other geniuses had the strength to face the war realms, they wouldn’t provoke them.

As for Lin Yun, he was from the lower realms. Despite his status, his sword claimed the lives of countless people and he ended up becoming the biggest winner of the Azure Dragon Region. In the end, he surpassed everyone and obtained the opportunity above fortune. So there were many rumors about him being bloodthirsty and arrogant. However, no one thought he would dare to face the war realms.

“My turn then?” Lin Yun smiled. Before anyone could react to his words, Lin Yun tossed his cloak away and released a powerful sword intent that dazzled like a golden sun.

When the cloak flew towards Han Lei and Mo Xuan, their faces changed. They could sense that the cloak was dangerous, so they threw punches to stop it.

Meanwhile, the sword box that Lin Yun was carrying opened up as his sword flew into his hand. When he drew his sword, the aura coming from him was so powerful that the clouds were split in half to reveal a bright sun.
