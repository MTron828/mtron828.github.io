Chapter 1365 - Grant You Death at the Summit of the Fleeting Clouds! (1)

“GO!” Feng Jue yelled. Hearing that, Lin Yun gritted his teeth with a pair of Golden Crow Wings unfolding behind him. At the same time, his face was extremely ugly. How could he leave his senior brother behind while he ran?

Especially when he thought that Feng Jue might die in five moves, Lin Yun’s expression became even more ugly. But he knew that he still had to go or what Feng Jue had done for him would have no meaning.

“I never expected that as the shame of Radiant Sword Saint, you’d have quite the backbone.” Zhuge Qingyun looked at Feng Jue with mockery on his face. But he was calm and didn’t even bother about Lin Yun, who had fled. In his eyes, Lin Yun was a mere ant at the Elysium Core Realm. If he wanted to catch up to Lin Yun, he could instantly catch up in the blink of an eye.

“It’s none of your concern! With me around, there’s no way you will catch my junior brother!” Feng Jue wore a nervous expression, but his face was firm and unyielding.

“Hahaha!” Zhuge Qingyun laughed.

“What are you laughing at?” Feng Jue raged. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“I’m laughing at the fact that you’re too naive.” Zhuge Qingyun shook his head with a smile on his face. Before Feng Jue could respond, Zhuge Qingyun’s palm had already landed on him, executing the Profound Sky Sect—Universal Reversal!

As sun and moon revolved in his palm, the surrounding space distorted as primitive chaos appeared with boundless light shining from him. When his palm descended, Feng Jue didn’t even have the chance to draw his sword and his sword aura instantly crumbled, causing Feng Jue to collapse on the ground.

This attack from Zhuge Qingyun had made a mess out of Feng Jue’s meridians, leaving his internal organs injured. As Feng Jue threw out blood, his face was extremely pale with fragments of his internal organs in the blood that he threw out.

A single attack from Zhuge Qingyun made Feng Jue fall into despair because he couldn’t even take a single move from Zhuge Qingyun. As tears welled in his eyes, he felt extremely guilty and felt that he was extremely useless with his head lowered.

“Trash like you should live well. You’re only the shame of the Radiant Sword Saint when you live in this world. Perhaps the Radiant Sword Saint isn’t as strong as rumored,” smiled Zhuge Qingyun as he looked at Feng Jue. When he turned to look at the direction Lin Yun left in, a mocking smile rose on the corner of his lips.

“Stop!” Feng Jue’s eyes became red as he struggled back up onto his feet, wanting to stop Zhuge Qingyun. But Zhuge Qingyun didn’t turn around. He merely waved his hand through the air, sending Feng Jue flying away.

“I’m born before heaven, and I’ll live even if heaven is destroyed.” But just when Zhuge Qingyun was about to take a step out, an unusual aura appeared with an echoing voice.

“This empress is eighteen years old, one year for each era!”

“Who is it?!” Zhuge Qingyun’s face changed as he looked around.

When he finally saw who was speaking, it was a little girl with well-sculpted features. She had silver white hair that looked like snow, and her eyes looked like two deep abysses. On her forehead, there was a golden and crimson mark that made her look even more extraordinary.

“Who are you?” Zhuge Qingyun asked in an uncertain tone.

“I’m the Divine Phoenix Clan’s Supreme Heavenly Slaughter Empress of Four Seas, Eight Barrens, 36 Heavens, and 72 Earths!” Lil’ Purple said proudly.

When Zhuge Qingyun heard what she said, he was instantly stumped because judging from the sound of it, that origin was a little terrifying. But when he looked at Lil’ Purple, he began to feel weird because Lil’ Purple’s cultivation was a little too low for her to be the so-called ‘Supreme Heavenly Slaughter Empress’. But the peerless temperament that was being emitted from the little girl wasn’t fake, and this was why it made Zhuge Qingyun feel weird.

“Zhuge Qingyun, why aren’t you kneeling upon seeing this empress?!” Lil’ Purple coldly said as she stood on the Snow Heed Blade.

Zhuge Qingyun was startled because no one had ever spoken to him in this manner ever since he appeared in public. But the prestige that Lil’ Purple was giving off was comparable to his master; or rather, the prestige given off by Lil’ Purple was even more terrifying than his master.

This made Zhuge Qingyun begin to wonder what was going on. As Zhuge Qingyun became anxious, beads of sweat rolled down from his forehead. He had an extraordinary eyesight, and he knew that there were many ancient clans in the world with huge origins that not even saints dared to provoke.

He then began to wonder if Lil’ Purple was really from the Divine Phoenix Clan. While holding onto the fan in his hand, he had no idea what to do because he was placed in a difficult position since the aura that Lil’ Purple was giving off was too weak, so weak that it even made Zhuge Qingyun doubt his own cultivation.

But he soon thought of something. If Lil’ Purple was really from an ancient clan, how did she know about him? This was simply too bizarre.

As he recovered from his shock, a smile appeared on Zhuge Qingyun’s face as he said, “Senior, your words are too heavy. I wonder what relationship you have with the sword sect? Your sudden appearance makes this junior feel uneasy.”

“Why does this empress need to…” But before Lil’ Purple could finish, Zhuge Qingyun raised his hand and unleashed his attack. His attack made blood drip down from the corner of Lil’ Purple’s lips as she was immediately sent flying away and fainted on the surface of the sea.

“Pitiful tricks.” The smile disappeared on Zhuge Qingyun’s face and was replaced by a cold expression. He continued, “I was nearly fooled by a little brat. Let me take a look and see where you came from!”

When Zhuge Qingyun took a step forth, he teleported before Lil’ Purple in the blink of an eye. But just when he was about to make a move, Lil’ Purple suddenly opened her eyes and the two origin divine runes on her forehead flew out like shackles.

In the blink of an eye, the shackles bound onto Zhuge Qingyun as Lil’ Purple sat in the air. When she formed a seal with both of her hands, light bloomed from her forehead and her hair turned silver. As her hair fluttered in the wind, her expression became indifferent without any emotions.

“Damn it!” Zhuge Qingyun was greatly startled because he discovered that he couldn’t break free from the shackles.

“Who the hell are you?!” Zhuge Qingyun said while gritting his teeth and his face had sunken. But Lil’ Purple merely looked at him coldly with disdain flashing through her pupils and didn’t answer him.

On the other side, Lin Yun had returned, riding on Lil' Red, who had turned into the warhorse form.

“Junior Brother…are you here to save me?” Feng Jue was touched when he saw Lin Yun coming over. But just when he was done speaking, the horse spat its saliva all over his face. But before he could even respond, the horse had turned around and Lin Yun grabbed onto Feng Jue’s shoulder from the horse’s back.

“Empress, time for us to go!” Lin Yun said nervously to Lil’ Purple.
