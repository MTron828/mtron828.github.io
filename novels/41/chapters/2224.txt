Chapter 2225 - A Reason To Go

“A pity that you can’t see me become an Emperor?” Lin Yun could guess what he wanted to say.

The Dragon Origin Great Saint was stumped. But just when he was about to speak, Lin Yun held onto his hand. His hand was crude, but Lin Yun held onto his hand tightly as he stood up with the other hand on the Dragon Origin Great Saint’s shoulder.

Raising his head, Lin Yun said, “I don’t know if you can see me become an Emperor or not, but I will see you become an Emperor. Master, believe me.”

Lin Yun’s voice was sincere as they held their hands together. That was his resolve.

“You brat…” The Dragon Origin Great Saint looked at Lin Yun with tears. He was already so old, but he nearly teared up because of what a junior said. He must admit that the Radiant Sword Saint had taken in a good disciple.

The training regimen officially ended two days later and Lin Yun bade his farewells with the Great Saints and returned to Indigothunder Peak.

“I have been waiting for you, and you’re finally back.” Lil’ Purple smiled when she saw Lin Yun. “Where did you go? Why does it seem like you have become much stronger?”

She examined Lin Yun and discovered that his cultivation might be at the Sacred Flame Stage of the Heavenly Origin Phase, but the aura he gave off was powerful. He also gave off an aura that seemed threatening to Lil’ Purple.

Lin Yun didn’t hide it from her and revealed to her the training regimen he went through. When Lil’ Purple heard that, she began to exclaim that it was no wonder that Lin Yun had gotten so strong.

“Where’s Lil’ Red?” Lin Yun asked curiously.

“Hehe, it’s going into seclusion in the Iris Secret Realm. If it’s lucky, Lil’ Red might reach the Saint Realm before you,” Lil’ Purple said.

Lin Yun was really envious of Lil’ Red at this moment. After all, it was making a breakthrough again and could keep making breakthroughs as long as it had enough resources.

“How is Bai Shuying?” Lin Yun asked the question that he was most concerned about.

“She’s fine. I taught her a secret technique of the Divine Phoenix Clan, so she can complement the flaw in her physique if everything goes well. As for whether it could reach the Great Solar Divine Physique, it would have to depend on her opportunity,” Lil’ Purple said.

“What opportunity?”

“A strand of the Solar True Flame. But this was rare even in ancient times, and it’s hard to say if she can find it.” Through Lil’ Purple, Lin Yun roughly knew that Bai Shuying was fine and she had stabilized her condition. The Solar Divine Rune was also in Lin Yun’s hands.

“Lin Yun, when will we go after that demoness and take back the Lunar Divine Rune?” Lil’ Purple anxiously asked. Now that the Solar Divine Rune was in her hand, she was anxious to find the Lunar Divine Rune.

“I’d look for her even if you didn’t ask me to,” Lin Yun said with a chill flashing in his eyes. The enmity between him and Wang Muyan had been formed, and it was to the extent that it couldn’t be fixed.

They could be considered friends and enemies in the past. But after the ninth, the Heavenly Dao Sect suffered massive casualties, especially when the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda was taken away. It struck a great blow to the Heavenly Dao Sect’s status as a holy land and was no longer the strongest holy land in the Eastern Desolation.

“That lass is probably at the God Burial Mountain Range,” Lil’ Purple said excitedly. Her eyes lit up, and she said, “When you’re not around, I asked about the rumors about the deity’s corpse in the God Burial Mountain Range. The Demonspirit Clan and Blood Moon Sect had joined forces to destroy Six Holy City, and those from the six holy lands were chased out. As for those who couldn’t leave in time, they probably died. So the God Burial Mountain Range is bustling now.”

“You seem so concerned about it that you even asked around,” Lin Yun asked.

“Hmph, this concerns the Lunar Divine Rune, so I naturally have to be concerned about it. I won’t be able to feel at ease without retrieving the Lunar Divine Rune,” Lil’ Purple said.

Lin Yun’s face changed because the Sovereign Divine Runes were a concern if Lil’ Purple wanted to regain her strength and restore the Iris Secret Realm. His and Lil’ Purple’s interests were the same on this factor alone.

“Let’s get moving. Don’t hesitate anymore,” Lil’ Purple urged. “Now that your strength has undergone a great boost. With my help, it’s time for Flower Burial to show himself to the world once again.”

While she had been waiting for Lin Yun, she asked about the situation at the God Burial Mountain Range and then waited for ten-odd days. She was already anxious about going to the God Burial Mountain Range.

Lin Yun rolled his eyes because he would rather rely on himself if he had to rely on Lil’ Purple. After all, Lil’ Purple wasn't reliable, and her means would usually cause damage to both sides.

Lil’ Purple was only knowledgeable and proficient in spiritual runes, but she lacked strength. Most importantly, Lin Yun didn’t know the exact situation on the God Burial Mountain Range.

He took a cup of tea and said, “If there’s really a deity’s corpse, Divine Blood Fruits can also be found there, right?”

“The Divine Blood Fruits are nothing. There are rumors that this deity’s corpse possesses a complete divine flame!” Lil’ Purple said in disdain.

Lin Yun placed the cup down as his thoughts began to process. He had to go to the God Burial Mountain Range no matter what.

“The God Burial Mountain Range’s restrictions have loosened again, and Saints can now enter. Many people have gathered on the God Burial Mountain Range, and many Saints have already losing their patience,” Lil’ Purple said emotionally. “We can give up on the divine flame since Saints will definitely go after it, but we have to retrieve the Lunar Divine Rune.

“As for the Divine Blood Fruit, don’t care about it because it can only extend one’s lifespan, and many Saints would probably go after it as well. We can just go for the Lunar Divine Rune, and it will be safe.”

“You’re naive. Since Wang Muyan is the Divine Maiden, how can she not have Saints from the Blood Moon Sect around her? It’s not easy to seize the Lunar Divine Rune back from her,” Lin Yun sneered.

“Oh, yeah.” Lil’ Purple scratched her head and said, “That demoness is really hard to deal with. Even if she has Saints around her, the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda alone is troublesome.”

“We don’t have to fear the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda,” Lin Yun said. In the past, because his cultivation wasn’t high enough, he could barely use the Buddhist Emperor Golden Lotus Spear, and he would injure himself if he wasn’t careful. But now that his divine physique had reached the pinnacle of the Dragon Body Phase, it shouldn’t be a problem for him to use it now.

The Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella might have been destroyed, but he still had the Buddhist Emperor Golden Lotus Spear, which was way stronger and more mysterious.

“Since that’s the case, let’s get going,” Lil’ Purple said.

“There’s no need to hurry. I still have some stuff to discuss with the peak master.” Lin Yun was a cautious person, and he naturally had to have a good understanding of the situation at the God Burial Mountain Range before making a move.

The Indigothunder Peak Master had reached the Saint Realm and should now be called the Indigothunder Saint Lord. So, his information was definitely more accurate than Lil’ Purple’s.

When the Indigothunder Saint Lord knew why Lin Yun was here, he frowned, “The Heavenly Dao Sect would normally be present for an event like this, but the Heavenly Dao Sect is in a mess. The Thousand Plume Great Saint has decided that we won’t get involved. I’m afraid that I can’t give you much help.”

Lin Yun wasn’t surprised since the Heavenly Dao Sect took a huge blow after the ninth with their subsidiary forces being devoured. Aside from the Divine Dao Pavilion, the Ming Cult, Heavenly Flame Sect, and Myriad Lightning Sect have started to put their eyes on the Heavenly Dao Sect’s territory.

Many chambers of commerce, sects, and kingdoms belonging to the Heavenly Dao Sect took a great hit. They had either changed their allegiances, or were destroyed.

The Heavenly Dao Sect had a pile of troubles. Not only did they have to find out about the Wang and Ye Clan’s forces, they also had to be cautious of the forces behind the Bai and Zhang Clans. The biggest trouble was that no one knew if there were any more spies from the Blood Moon Sect within the sect.

Logically speaking, there must be spies from the Blood Moon Sect, but they could do nothing about it now. This was why the Heavenly Dao Sect wouldn’t be involved with the God Burial Mountain Range this time, and they couldn’t give Lin Yun much help.

“It’s better to keep a low profile for now. The Heavenly Dao Sect has many enemies. They might have given you face in the past, but not anymore,” the Indigothunder Saint Lord helplessly said.

“Peak Master, you don’t have to worry since I’m not reckless. So tell me about the situation in the God Burial Mountain Range,” Lin Yun smiled.

When the Indigothunder Peak Master shared what he knew, Lin Yun now had a rough idea of the God Burial Mountain Range. The God Burial Mountain Range had various forbidden grounds in the past, stopping many Saints from going there.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

But now that the seal was loosened, Saints would naturally rush over. But no one knew how loose the seal had become, and no one was able to confirm the information about the deity’s corpse.

“The seal might’ve been loosened, but it shouldn’t be too much. Saint Sovereigns shouldn’t be able to enter, but Saint Lords should be restricted to the first stage. However, I don’t know the exact situation,” the Indigothunder Peak Master shared his speculation.

Lin Yun felt relieved after hearing what the Indigothunder Peak Master said. After all, if the seal had loosened to the point that Saint Sovereigns could enter, it would be too dangerous, and Lin Yun couldn’t ensure his safety even with the Buddhist Emperor Golden Lotus Spear. But he had to make a trip over to understand the exact situation.

“Speaking of which, you’ve become a Saint Lord. Do you have any intentions of visiting the God Burial Mountain Range? There are many treasures there…” Lin Yun smiled.

The Indigothunder Peak Master showed yearning in his eyes but shook his head, “Don’t trick me. I’m barely at the second stage of the Saint Lord, and I would die if I ran into a formidable foe.”

Lin Yun smiled awkwardly upon seeing his intentions through, so he changed the topic. Since the Indigothunder Peak Master had no intentions of going, he could only give up on it.

But Lin Yun had decided to go to the God Burial Mountain Range no matter what.

When he returned from the main hall, he began to make preparations along with his trump cards. Before he left, he gave the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella to Mu Xueling, hoping she could fix it. Lin Yun had deep feelings for this Sovereign Saint Artifact and didn’t want it to be buried just like that.

But surprisingly, Ye Guhan, Serene Dust Great Saint, Heavenly Jade Sword Saint, and Mu Xueling didn’t stop him from going to the God Burial Mountain Range. Lin Yun even prepared a long explanation to convince them, but that all went down the drain.

“Junior Brother, you’re suitable to go to the God Burial Mountain Range. Even if you didn’t want to go, we would have escorted you there,” Ye Guhan smiled. “Bring back the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda if you can, but it doesn’t matter if you can’t. As for the Divine Blood Fruit…”

Ye Guhan grabbed Lin Yun’s sleeves, and whispered in Lin Yun’s ears, “You have to get the Divine Blood Fruit no matter what. Long Yun went to get a Divine Blood Fruit for you with preparations to die.”

Lin Yun was briefly stunned, but he soon understood. It was no wonder why Ye Guhan and the other Great Saints trained him so harshly. They had already made arrangements for him to go.

The Heavenly Dao Sect wouldn’t participate in the God Burial Mountain Range, but Flower Burial would be there.

“Don’t worry about it. I won’t let you guys down.” Lin Yun raised his brow, looking confident.

Ye Guhan wore a gratified smile, and said, “It’s good that you know about it. You can’t hide in the Heavenly Dao Sect forever, so you have to take a look at the outside world. Remember, you’re the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple, Flower Burial Lin Yun.”
