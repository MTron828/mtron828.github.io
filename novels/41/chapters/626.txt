Chapter 627 - Turning into Ashes

The torrential sword intent was terrifying when it merged with heaven and earth. Then, with his powerful and domineering aura that was exploding out, Lin Yun created a powerful tornado.

Overlord Sword—Thunderbolt Slasher!

Lightning began to rumble in the sky that made everything turn dark. Lin Yun raised his hand and swung his sword out. Under the empowerment of his xiantian sword intent at complete mastery, a dazzling silver bolt of lightning lit up everyone’s faces and was imprinted in their hearts. This sword was unbelievably fast no matter who was watching.

It was as if the entire world was currently in the sandstorm that Lin Yun created.

“This is impossible!” The Bloodwing Pavilion’s Grand Elder had shock written all over his face. His right hand was trembling as he pointed at Lin Yun with disbelief in his eyes. He was so shocked that he even forgot to dodge Lin Yun’s attack.

His attacks were faster than lightning, yet Lin Yun had dodged them all. As for Lin Yun, he only needed to use one attack to hit him. Additionally, Lin Yun’s sword actually managed to destroy his defences and the sword intent made his internal organs feel a stinging pain. He actually realized that even at his cultivation, he wasn’t able to get rid of the sword intent anytime soon.

Lin Yun’s sword intent wreaked havoc in the Grand Elder’s body, shocking him as he threw up a mouthful of blood. The Thunderbolt Slasher was Lin Yun’s ultimate move, which could even split someone in the pinnacle Yang stage in two.

Lin Yun’s cultivation was now in the greater Yang stage. With the empowerment of his xiantian sword intent at complete mastery, the power was definitely a lot stronger than before. So it was already impressive that the Grand Elder only had his defences torn apart without any heavy injuries.

Lin Yun’s hair fluttered in the wind that was blowing past him. He didn’t feel proud that he managed to tear apart the Grand Elder’s defences. He calmly tapped his foot on the ground before he swung his sword out once more, this time using the Solar Slash.

An explosion occurred and the sand on both sides of the elder soared into the sky like a water screen. Lin Yun held onto his sword as he stabbed it towards the Grand Elder who was busy retreating.

“Not good!” The Grand Elder was shocked as he quickly mustered all his origin energy and unleashed dozens of crimson swords around him that looked like ferocious beasts.

But Lin Yun’s attack tore through everything that was in its way, leaving only darkness. When light reappeared, the Grand Elder had a long gash on his chest as he was sent flying away.

“Damn it…” The Bloodwing Pavilion’s Grand Elder threw up a mouthful of blood with fear on his face from Lin Yun. This attack was even stronger than before, and he had no idea how Lin Yun managed to do it.

Holding onto the Flower Burial Sword, Lin Yun stood as he looked at the Grand Elder coldly. His opponent was ultimately a Yin-Yang stage expert.

“Holy shit. That sword actually cut off all the light. Just how sharp is that sword to accomplish this?”

“He just reached the greater Yang stage, right? Could it be that it was his xiantian sword intent?”

“That must be it. There’s also something unusual about his sword technique. It seems to be the long lost Overlord Sword. But even if the Overlord Sword is powerful, it’s impossible to injure a Yin-Yang stage expert without sword intent empowering it.” There were experienced elders among the audience that managed to analyze something from Lin Yun’s sword technique.

So much so that they even guessed that it was the Overlord Sword. But they were even more shocked by Lin Yun’s xiantian sword intent at complete mastery. The sword intent was at a level that even a Yin-Yang stage expert would be fearful of.

“Grand Elder!” The two elders of the Bloodwing Pavilion quickly rushed over with shocked faces. The remaining disciples also had shock on their faces as their jaws nearly touched the ground. They were shocked that the Grand Elder couldn’t suppress an eighteen-year-old brat.

“Attack!” The Grand Elder snorted coldly as he threw up a mouthful of blood. This time, he charged towards Lin Yun with the two elders.

“How did he manage to do it?” Xie Yunqiao was stunned like he had completely lost his soul. He knew how terrifying sword intent was since he had reached greater mastery and he knew how difficult it was to bring his sword intent to complete mastery. That alone was more than enough for Lin Yun to have a spot among the geniuses at his age.

Furthermore, Lin Yun was only eighteen, which made things even more unbelievable. Even Yan Kong muttered out, “As long as he doesn’t die, his name will surely spread like wildfire…”

Lin Yun had already shined brightly by defeating Ji Wuye. And now, he even managed to injure an elder in the Yin-Yang stage. This would definitely make his name spread throughout the Nether Prefecture. In the future, his name might even spread to the other eight prefectures.

One must know that not many people knew Lin Yun’s name before this event. Even the top ten on the outer ranking didn’t place Lin Yun in their eyes.

At the Heavenly Province Academy’s party, everyone, including Zhang Yuan, Mu Chen, Mo Ling, and Tang Yu, were dumbfounded. Once again, Lin Yun had shocked them with his strength. So much so that they even started to feel numb from the shock they felt.

“You guys want to face me together? Fine!” Lin Yun laughed while looking at the three elders from the Bloodwing Pavilion coming for him.

“You’re courting death!”

“It doesn’t matter if your xiantian sword intent is at complete mastery. You’ll die today!”

“The Bloodwing Pavilion won’t let you off!” The Bloodwing Pavilion had never suffered such humiliation before. Killing intent began to boil in the three elders.

“Shattering Jade Fist!”

“Thunderbolt Palm!”

“Bloodshadow Dragon!” They brought out their ultimate attacks, which made many people’s faces change. A single elder was terrifying enough, not to mention that the three of them were working together.

But surprisingly, Lin Yun stood fearlessly as he allowed their attacks to envelop him. But just when those attacks were about to reach him, Lin Yun finally moved.

Where do the flowers bloom!

Lin Yun turned around and a rose began to dance around his sword. Before the three attacks even reached him, they shattered.

The eyes of the Bloodwing Pavilion’s Grand Elder flashed coldly as he charged over from a tricky angle. He made his move before Lin Yun could pull his sword back.

Where do I come from!

But Lin Yun sneered at him before stabbing his sword out. All of a sudden, Lin Yun had disappeared as the rose on the tip of his sword shattered. When the petals drifted along with the wind, a brilliant sword buzz began to ring out.

In the next second, the Grand Elder was sent flying away as he was covered in injuries. But before the Grand Elder landed on the ground, a sword ray flashed once more that pushed the two other elders back.

The endless mountain and lake; the crisping leaves and wind!

Every step he took would leave injuries on the two elders and it didn’t take long for them to be covered in blood.

Drifting flowers like dreams and sorrow like fine rain! No one possesses everything in this world, so I shall give the lord a white lily!

Lin Yun spun his sword as the petals began to dance in the air along with fine rain. In the blink of an eye, the two elders took no less than ten attacks from Lin Yun.

“Retreat!”

“Retreat for now and avoid his momentum!” With that, the three elders began to retreat.

Right at this moment, all the spectators were dumbfounded because they had never seen such a powerful sword technique before. They were so shocked that they were at a loss for words.

Lin Yun continued to press on to deal more injuries to the three elders. But just when the three elders were about to be in trouble, they brought out their martials souls and launched their counterattacks.

“They actually brought out their martial souls!”

“Interesting...three Yin-Yang stage elders are actually forced to bring out their martial souls when it’s already shameless to gang up on a young man.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“How can the elders of a quasi-overlord force be so shameless?”

“Lin Yun is in danger now. The moment his sword momentum breaks, he’ll lose his life.” Everyone's face changed when the three elders brought out their martial souls.

“Great timing!” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly as a boundless sword aura began to gush out from him.

I came from heaven! The flower blooms in my hand!

Lin Yun landed on the ground as he plunged the Flower Burial Sword into the ground before opening his right hand. There was a flower bud in his palm that was slowly opening up. As it opened up, a boundless sword intent also exploded out that made many people close their eyes.

In the next second, everything within a ten mile radius began to tremble violently as the three elders also had fear written on their faces. However, they still gritted their teeth as they charged over.

“A speck of dust shines through the mountain and river!” roared Lin Yun as the flower in his hand rose up into the sky like a sun radiating sword intent. When the light reached the limit, it suddenly exploded and everything was reduced to ashes, including the three Bloodwing Pavilion’s elders.
