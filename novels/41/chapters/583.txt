Chapter 584 - Heavenly Sword Sect's Core Disciple

Lin Yun narrowed his eyes and saw four luxuriously dressed youths standing in the Infernal Plaza. All of them were smiling with pride as they watched the two people fighting on the stage. Clearly, their temperament was different from the academy’s disciples.

When Lin Yun swept his glance over, he saw a cloud pattern with a sword embroidered on the middle of their clothes. Lin Yun naturally recognized those patterns since Mu Xue also had them. They must be inner disciples of the Heavenly Sword Sect.

But when Lin Yun didn’t see any core disciples around, he was surprised. It looks like the true expert from the Heavenly Sword Sect must be in the Imperial Study Hall with Mu Xue and the elders.

Lin Yun then turned his attention to the stage to the youth who was fighting with Mei Ziyan. The youth seemed like he was barely eighteen, but the sword aura he was releasing placed Mei Ziyan in a disadvantageous position.

“Is this all you have? It’s not enough…” The youth smiled as he raised his brow at Mei Ziyan.

Mei Ziyan didn’t utter a word despite all the grievance pent up in his chest. Instead, he spread his origin energy all over his body before he took a step forward and threw a punch.

“You’re finally going to unleash your strength in the lesser Yang stage? You’re barely qualified to be my opponent now.” The youth smiled when he sensed Mei Ziyan’s punch as he reached out and grabbed onto Mei Ziyan’s fist.

“How is this possible…” Mei Ziyan had shock written on his face. He couldn’t believe that the youth had so easily caught his attack at the pinnacle lesser Yang stage.

“Get back down!” The youth sneered as he tossed Mei Ziyan. He then barraged him with punches as he yelled, “You’re still a little too weak!”

All the Heavenly Province Academy’s disciples wore an unsightly expression because they clearly didn’t expect Mei Ziyan to lose so easily.

“Let’s end this,” barked the youth as his right fist suddenly became sharp like a sword that pierced through Mei Ziyan’s aura. His punch landed on Mei Ziyan’s chest and Mei Ziyan threw up a mouthful of blood. When the fluctuation calmed down, Mei Ziyan took several steps back before he managed to stabilize himself.

“The Heavenly Province Academy’s foundation in martial techniques is too weak. You might still be young, but you’re too weak. So is there a need for us to continue?” The youth said with disappointment in his eyes.

This youth was named Mu Chen and he was ranked in the top three among the inner disciples. Furthermore, he was only eighteen, which meant that his potential was terrifying. No one dared to underestimate him back in the Heavenly Sword Sect, so he naturally didn’t have to give Mei Ziyan any face.

“The Heavenly Sword Sect is really impressive indeed, but you’re not invincible in our academy. We have someone here the same age as you who even defeated Cao Zhen from the Northern Snow Manor,” said Mei Ziyan with an awkward smile.

“I’ve heard of him and I’m here to meet him. Do you know where he is?” Mu Chen was briefly stunned before his eyes flared with dense fighting spirits.

“Isn’t he over there?” Mei Ziyan’s eyes flashed coldly as he turned to look at Lin Yun. He had perfectly diverted the crisis to Lin Yun.

“Lin Yun!”

“Deacon Lin!” All the academy’s disciples instantly noticed Lin Yun. Lin Yun had retracted his aura earlier, but he still became the center of attention.

“Are you Flower Burial Lin Yun from the rumors?” Mu Chen looked at Lin Yun with interest. At the same time, he was doubtful that Lin Yun’s cultivation was only in the pinnacle Yin stage. Although the aura coming from Lin Yun was powerful, it still didn’t change the fact that Lin Yun’s cultivation was only in the pinnacle Yin stage.

He smiled, “Cao Zhen is formidable and I initially wanted to fight him. But I didn’t expect him to be defeated by a swordsman from the Great Qin Empire. Since you’re here, are you interested in sparring?”

Mu Chen and Lin Yun were both the same age, but their temperaments were different. Mu Chen’s aura was unrestrained, while Lin Yun’s aura was more reserved. Lin Yun was this way even after his xiantian sword intent reached complete mastery.

“Not interested,” said Lin Yun as he retracted his gaze. He wasn’t interested in Mu Chen, who wasn’t even a core disciple. This person roughly had the same strength as Cao Zhen. He would be either slightly stronger or weaker than Cao Zhen, so Lin Yun wasn’t interested in that.

Even if he ran into Cao Zhen again, Lin Yun was confident that he could defeat Cao Zhen in three moves. So he wasn’t interested in someone who treated Cao Zhen as his opponent.

“Lin Yun, are you afraid?” Mei Ziyan said in a teasing voice. He could sense that Mu Chen didn’t use all his strength, which meant that Mu Chen was definitely stronger than Cao Zhen.

“Do I need to explain myself to trash like you? You should be thinking about why you were defeated so badly…” Lin Yun sneered as he turned to leave.

“You want to leave? Did I agree to it?” Mu Chen charged forward with his origin energy released as he threw a punch. Sensing the powerful punch, Lin Yun turned around and casually threw out a punch.

Facing Lin Yun’s punch, Mu Chen froze in mid-air before he was sent flying. When he fell onto the ground, shock was written all over his face. “What refined origin energy!” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

The other Heavenly Sword Sect’s disciples were also shocked by this scene. Even the Heavenly Province Academy’s disciples were briefly stunned when they saw how Lin Yun sent Mu Chen flying so easily before they responded with cheers.

On the other hand, Mei Ziyan’s face had changed drastically as his heart sank. He had no idea how Lin Yun got so powerful in just half a month. He could sense that Lin Yun’s strength had undergone a total transformation since the Five Academies Competition.

Looking at Mu Chen coldly, Lin Yun said, “Like I said, I don’t have any interest in you. Don’t bother embarrassing yourself with your strength.”

“What an arrogant fellow!”

“Junior Brother Mu hasn’t even used his sword!” The faces of the four Heavenly Province Academy’s faces became ugly. As disciples of an overlord force, they all felt that they were above the Heavenly Province Academy. But they didn’t expect that they would be humiliated so badly by Lin Yun.

“No wonder you defeated Cao Zhen. All the more reason you can’t leave today!” Mu Chen stood up as he wiped the blood off his lips. With fighting spirit blazing in his eyes, Mu Chen began to release a terrifying aura along with a pressure that belonged to the greater Yang stage.

“Junior Brother, catch! Teach this brat a lesson!” The four disciples threw out a sword towards Mu Chen.

The moment Mu Chen grabbed onto the sword, he stabbed it into the ground. A buzzing noise instantly caused cracks to start spreading out on the ground. Simultaneously, Mu Chen’s aura had undergone a drastic change as he sneered, “Since you said it, show me how you’ll embarrass me!”

Everyone could sense the terrifying chill coming from Mu Chen at this moment. Lin Yun also felt helpless as he knew that there was no way he could avoid this battle anymore. Then again, he could also take this opportunity to evaluate the strength of an overlord force’s disciple. Cao Zhen might be strong, but he wasn’t the same as Mu Chen, who came from a sect that practiced swords.

“Hold it right there!” Just when fighting spirits began to boil in Lin Yun’s heart, a cold bark sounded out as two figures descended from the sky. It was a man and woman. The woman was naturally Mu Xue. The man that was with her had two swords embroidered on the cloud pattern on his chest.

With just a glance, Lin Yun instantly knew what that emblem meant. That emblem meant that this man was a core disciple of the Heavenly Sword Sect!
