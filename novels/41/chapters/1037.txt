Chapter 1038 - Arrival Of A Storm

When Lin Yun saw the words written in blood, his face sank, “Whose blood is that?”

“Hehe, why don’t you guess?” He Qianfan laughed eerily before he raised his voice, “Half a month from now, the Nether Divinity, Elysium Trigram, and Profound Dragon Realm Sons will host the Demon Slaughtering Assembly in the Wind Mound City! Everyone is welcome to watch, hahaha!”

“Demon Slaughtering Assembly? What’s that?” Everyone began to discuss among themselves because it seemed like the Realm Sons were planning to kill someone.

“Lin Yun, you have to come or else you won’t be able to see your lover for the last time!” He Qianfan revealed a mocking smile. So what if Lin Yun defeated him? Lin Yun still had to obediently head over to Wind Mound City. The Demon Slaughtering Assembly was a trap that the Realm Sons set up for Lin Yun and there was nothing he could do about it.

“Whose blood is this?!” Lin Yun raised his head as killing intent leaked out of his pupils.

“Why don’t you guess?” provoked He Qianfan.

It was rare for Lin Yun to have any fluctuation in his emotions, but he couldn’t keep his composure at this moment. His face was twitching and his hand was trembling uncontrollably as he was losing control of his killing intent.

“You’re angry?” He Qianfan grinned, “I know that you’re furious, but this is Four Phase City. There’s nothing you can do even if you’re angry. Hehehe, come and kill me if you dare!”

He Qianfan struggled to his feet as he slowly retreated to the border of the plaza with a smile. “Lin Yun, can’t you guess whose blood it is? Prove that you’re a man! Kill me!”

As long as he took another step, he would be out of the plaza and Lin Yun wouldn’t be able to touch him anymore. After all, it would be a violation of the rules of Four Phase City. Anyone who violated the rules would lose the qualification to make it into the final battle and they might even be imprisoned.

Seeing how disgusting He Qianfan was, everyone in the plaza had disdain in their eyes. If they were in Lin Yun’s position, they would probably throw up blood in anger.

“Pig! Don’t fall for it!” Pei Xue’s face was filled with concern and she yelled despite her injuries.

The boundless killing aura from Lin Yun made the temperature in the plaza plummet. However, Lin Yun didn’t make a move, which relieved the crowd.

Unfortunately for Lin Yun, he couldn’t vent his anger. It was a terrible feeling because He Qianfan was clearly weaker than him.

The sinister smile gradually disappeared from He Qianfan’s face when Lin Yun didn’t fall for his provocation. “You really are a piece of trash. I thought you only needed one sword to kill someone? What utter bullshit. You can’t even do anything to me right now!”

His face was cold as he was done playing around with Lin Yun. There was nothing he could do other than wait for half a month. At that time, Lin Yun would get killed by the Realm Sons. Although he didn’t show it on the surface, Lin Yun calling him a dog was like a dagger to the heart.

“Lin Yun, I’ll be waiting for you at Wind Mound City. It’ll be boring if you don’t show up.” He Qianfan laughed before he turned around to leave.

“Who permitted you to leave?” Lin Yun turned around and looked at He Qianfan while playing with the invitation in his hand. His words stunned He Qianfan before making the latter laugh. Just as He Qianfan was about to turn around, an eerie light flew over and stabbed his throat.

As blood began to flow down from his throat, He Qianfan’s vitality slowly slipped away. The invitation that was in Lin Yun’s hands was now in his throat. This made He Qianfan’s face twitch as his eyes bulged with disbelief. He couldn’t believe that Lin Yun actually dared to make a move against him.

The spectators were also looking at the invitation deeply plunged in He Qianfan’s throat. He was still alive, but no one could tell how long he would be alive for. He Qianfan held onto the invitation with fear in his eyes as he tried to pull it out.

“Don’t…” Lin Yun advised. “Don’t move. I’ve empowered the invitation with my sky sword intent, so you’ll be decapitated the moment you pull it out. Well, I guess someone who’s merely ranked ninth on the purple ranking doesn’t know how profound the sky sword intent is. But I advise you to trust me.”

He Qianfan’s face changed when he heard what Lin Yun said and no longer dared to move. He looked at Lin Yun gradually approaching him with narrowed eyes.

Lin Yun started tidying He Qianfan’s clothes before patting his face, “What a handsome face. It’s such a shame that you’ve become a dog. You want to head to Kunlun Realm? I’m sorry but you won’t be going anywhere. But it won’t matter because no one will care what happens to a dog.”

He Qianfan’s body began to tremble as he fell to his knees. He didn’t dare to utter a word and could only transmit his voice through origin energy, “Lin Yun, spare me. Please, don’t kill me.”

“This is Four Phase City, so how can I possibly kill you? This is just a friendly spar. But you better stay alive or else I’ll be in trouble,” said Lin Yun indifferently.

Anyone could spar in the plaza as long as no lives were taken. Technically, Lin Yun wasn’t in violation of any rules as long as He Qianfan was alive. And by the time that He Qianfan died, the Heavenly Path would be over.

When everyone recovered from their shock, they looked at Lin Yun with a renewed sense of terror.

“Are you furious? Calm down, getting angry will only speed up your blood flow. If that happens, you’ll die even faster. I know that you’re furious, but you better suck it up. Who knows, someone might save you in half a month if I die at Wind Mound City,” continued Lin Yun.

“Lin Yun, no, Grandpa Lin!” He Qianfan had fallen into despair at this moment. “Grandpa Lin, you’re my grandpa! Please, spare me!”

“I don’t have an unfilial grandson like you.” Lin Yun patted He Qianfan on the head. Lin Yun’s palm was dangerous as it shattered He Qianfan’s skull. In doing so, Lin Yun sealed He Qianfan’s aura oceans, which slowed the flow of the latter’s origin energy and vitality.

“Carry on kneeling then,” said Lin Yun. “I’m sorry that everyone has to look at this foolish grandson of mine. But if anyone dares to save him, they’ll have to face my sword!”

With a wave of his hand, Lin Yun summoned his sword and boundless sword intent soared into the sky. When he swung his sword down, the light in heaven and earth became dim. At the same time, the water in the lake was split in half.

“Sky sword intent!” Everyone was left dumbfounded by this scene. They had heard many rumors about Lin Yun being an unrivaled talent in the way of the sword.

Today, they had finally witnessed Lin Yun’s talent. His sword was simply beyond their imagination and no one below the gold ranking dared to face the sword head-on.

The crowd knew that He Qianfan was beyond saving. Furthermore, no one dared to stand against Lin Yun after sensing the power of his sword. Lastly, He Qianfan was a dog that no one would take pity on him.

Lin Yun slowly sheathed his sword before turning to look at He Qianfan’s lackeys. They were scared out of their wits as they crawled away from the plaza. But when they sensed Lin Yun’s gaze, they instantly froze.

“Tell the Realm Sons that we’ll continue playing in half a month,” said Lin Yun. “But before that, if they dared to touch even a strand of Yue Weiwei’s hair, I swear that I’ll slaughter their realms. They can test me if they dare!” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

His voice rumbled like lightning and no one dared to doubt his words. They knew that there would be a storm in Wind Mound City half a month from now that would shake the Heavenly Path.
