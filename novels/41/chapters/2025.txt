Chapter 2026 - You’re Already Dead

Although Jin Xuanyi managed to avoid all the attacks targeted at his vitals, he still suffered some wounds on his body, especially his face. This scene shocked everyone present. They all knew how strong Jin Xuanyi was as first on the King Ranking. Even Qu Duan, who grasped the Black Lotus Sacred Flame, was defeated by him.

When they fought, Qu Duan couldn’t even touch the corner of Jin Xuanyi’s clothes. Who would've imagined Ye Qingtian to be so strong? Ye Qingtian relied on his sword techniques alone to inflict injuries on Jin Xuanyi.

“What a profound sword technique!”

“His attainment in the sword was a little unbelievable, and it’s enough to complement his disadvantage in his cultivation. Only someone like him can be called a swordsman!” Everyone was emotional, and they could feel their blood boiling.

Everyone from the Heavenly Dao Sect heaved a sigh of relief, especially Xin Yan.

Wang Muyan held onto her chin and smiled, “Didn’t I say that Ye Qingtian isn’t weak? He obtained a great benefit within the Myriad Graves Valley!”

“He’s actually so strong…” Wang Yue and Chen Zhong were stumped because they believed that Ye Qingtian was only slightly stronger than them. So it was unbelievable for Ye Qingtian to surpass them by so much in just two months.

Amongst the group, Li Yanxian exclaimed, “As expected of a genius swordsman. Jin Xuanyi can’t defeat him with sword dao.”

But Qu Duan, who was defeated by Jin Xuanyi, unhappily said, “His sword technique is impressive, but he’s too tender. Jin Xuanyi is strong in his overall strength, and he has no weaknesses. Not to mention he even received the Lightning Qilin’s inheritance.”

Li Yanxian nodded, “That’s right. Jin Xuanyi has the Lightning Qilin’s inheritance. He's simply invincible, based on his cultivation and attainment in lightning dao.”

In the arena, Jin Xuanyi became cautious and said, “As expected of a genius swordsman. I have underestimated you, and you’re now qualified to fight me.”

“You’re not bad, but you’re still lacking as a top-tiered expert. You have no odds against me,” Lin Yun honestly replied.

Jin Xuanyi’s face sank when he heard that. He only tried to be courteous, but Ye Qingtian treated it seriously and mocked him instead. As the mark bloomed on his forehead, an ancient aura swept out from Jin Xuanyi, and his body swelled. “Who’s a top-tiered expert then? You? You better admit defeat quickly!”

Jin Xuanyi’s clothes blew apart, revealing his upper body that drew an exclamation. His upper body was covered in runes, and his pupils became purple. The transformation to his hands was even more terrifying as they had turned black and emitted a metallic luster. As horrifying lightning exploded from him, Jin Xuanyi gave off an ancient Qilin aura that caused the arena to tremble.

“Ye Qingtian, come and have a taste of my Qilin arms!” Jin Xuanyi disappeared, leaving behind lightning on the spot.

Lin Yun had no change on his face as he stabbed his sword forth. But Jin Xuanyi wasn’t afraid as he used his hands to clamp onto Lin Yun’s sword.

The sword began to vibrate as lightning spread across the sword to Lin Yun, which felt stinging.

“You’re too slow!” Jin Xuanyi smiled.

But Lin Yun merely trembled and drew his sword back. As they fought, their speed became so fast that no one could keep up with them. Each of their collisions would produce a metallic collision, and everyone could faintly see Jin Xuanyi blocking Ye Qingtian’s sword with his arms, which made their faces change.

Even if the Lightning Qilin was only a branch and not the genuine Qilin, it still made their scalps numb.

“Hahaha, do you think you can injure me? Ye Qingtian, take my punch!” Jin Xuanyi laughed. He took an attack with his body before throwing his punch forth. His punch was accompanied by a Qilin roar, with an ancient Qilin appearing behind him.

Lin Yun held onto his sword and raised it horizontally before him to block the attack. Lin Yun was knocked a hundred meters away as the sword bent from the immense power.

“It has just begun!” Jin Xuanyi revealed a brutal smile and disappeared before Lin Yun. Gathering all his power, Jin Xuanyi punched forth, and thunderclouds enveloped the arena.

“Too slow!”

“Too slow!”

“Too slow!”

Jin Xuanyi laughed as he ducked around and mocked Lin Yun’s speed. With that, he had firmly grasped the situation in the arena.

Lin Yun only used his Divine Firefly Sword to defend against Jin Xuanyi’s strong attacks. Whenever he threw his punch forth, it was further empowered by the Qilin runes on his body. Ten-odd moves later, a huge clash occurred in the arena as Jin Xuanyi’s punch clashed with the Flower Burial Sword.

When Lin Yun clashed with Jin Xuanyi, an azure dragon appeared behind him while a Lightning Qilin appeared behind Jin Xuanyi.

“Time to end this!” Jin Xuanyi grinned and grabbed Lin Yun’s sword with his right hand. His hand was like the hand of a Qilin, firmly grabbing onto the Flower Burial Sword.

“Everything is nothing before absolute strength, not to mention you’re really slow!” Jin Xuanyi’s eyes flashed coldly, and his laughter spread across the arena. He began accumulating strength in his left hand while grabbing the Flower Burial Sword.

The Qilin runes on his body began to blaze. As he poured them into his left hand, the power in his fist grew even stronger. Lin Yun held his front against Jin Xuanyi, relying on his sword. Not even a Quasi-Saint would feel good taking an attack from Jin Xuanyi head-on, and Ye Qingtian would be doomed if he lost his sword. His cultivation was only at the seventh transformation of the Nirvana Stage, and he would be dead if he took Jin Xuanyi’s punch head-on.

“He’s doomed!” Qu Duan clenched his fists together and looked nervous. He had fought with Jin Xuanyi before and knew how powerful Jin Xuanyi was. Even his Black Lotus Saint Physique could barely take a head-on attack from him.

Most importantly, Ye Qingtian was a swordsman. A swordsman without his sword was the same as a tiger without teeth. Although Jin Xuanyi might be shameless, this was the best way to deal with a swordsman.

Lin Yun tried to struggle free from Jin Xuanyi’s grasp, but he couldn’t draw his sword back.

“What else do you have?” Jin Xuanyi sneered.

Lin Yun was decisive in letting go of his sword and taking a few steps back.

“Hahaha! There’s no way for you to run now!” Jin Xuanyi laughed. It was all within his expectation that Ye Qingtian could only throw his sword away. It was satisfying to force a swordsman to give up his sword. If a swordsman didn’t have a sword, would he still have his sword aura?

Jin Xuanyi roared, releasing his qilin aura, wanting to restrict Lin Yun. But he was surprised when he saw Ye Qingtian charging forth with an even faster speed after taking two steps back.

Lin Yun used his fingers as a sword and targeted Jin Xuanyi’s chest. This forced Jin Xuanyi to release the Flower Burial Sword and take two steps back. At the same time, Jin Xuanyi took this opportunity to throw his punch forth, and the accumulated power formed a lightning vortex that wanted to devour Lin Yun.

After reaching out to grab the Flower Burial Sword, Lin Yun gathered his sword aura and swung his sword around, slicing the lightning vortex into two. At the same time, he spread his arms apart and landed on the ground.

“Qilin—God Annihilation Vortex!” Jin Xuanyi roared and unleashed an even more powerful vortex. When the vortex appeared, the arena began to tremble to the point that it seemed like it would collapse the next moment.

This was the complete God Annihilation Vortex, and it was more terrifying than executing it with one hand. The moment Jin Xuanyi unleashed his attack, the faces of everyone on the King Ranking changed.

“Light of the Beginning!” Lin Yun roared and swung his sword. No one could keep track of his sword and only saw a blur. When the light clashed with the black vortex, Jin Xuanyi took a step back. Everything happened in the blink of an eye.

“Ye Qingtian, your sword is really slow.” Jin Xuanyi smiled. He had detected the danger earlier and had avoided it ahead of time.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“You’re already dead.” Lin Yun landed on the ground and sheathed his sword.

Jin Xuanyi still had no idea what was happening, but then he suddenly squinted his pupils as a line circled around his neck. A blinding sword ray gushed out from his neck the next moment.

The light made everyone’s eyes sting, but none shifted their gazes away because this scene was too shocking.

As sword rays and blood gushed out, Jin Xuanyi’s head flew away, his head rolling on the ground, dying with his eyes wide open. Like that, a headless corpse stood in the arena, blood gushing from its neck. The thunderclouds dissipated, signifying a legendary genius's death.

The surroundings fell into silence. Even Qu Duan and Li Yanxian kept silent, with their scalps feeling numb. They were like the others, with their gazes focused on Ye Qingtian.

A brief moment later, Li Yanxian came to his senses and looked at Qu Duan with horror. He tremblingly asked, “D-Did you see that sword earlier?”

Qu Duan was at a loss because he couldn’t accept what was happening before his eyes. Jin Xuanyi, who was like a god earlier, was killed just like that with one sword? Jin Xuanyi was invincible within his eyes, which was why Qu Duan couldn’t accept Jin Xuanyi’s death.

“No… I didn’t manage to see that sword,” Qu Duan said in a trembling tone after coming to his senses.

He only saw a ray of light and couldn’t see Ye Qingtian’s sword at all. Only Jin Xuanyi managed to see Ye Qingtian’s sword, but he was already dead.
