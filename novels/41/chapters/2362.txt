Chapter 2363 - Sword Dao Holy Land

Shangguan Jue looked at Lin Yun with lingering fear in his eyes. He could be considered calm, but it was different for Zhao Zhanli.

“Chief, it’s him! He snatched our Flame Origin Pellets, and he took Senior Brother Shangguan’s eighteen Divine Dragon Destiny Pellets!” Zhao Zhanli was furious and emotional. He furiously continued, “Since when has the Shadow Divine Palace suffered such a loss?!”

“I know you’re anxious, but calm down and let Shangguan finish,” Heavenly Book smiled, looking at Zhao Zhanli. It was true that Zhao Zhanli was anxious, but he could only keep his mouth shut.

On the other hand, Shangguan Jue was calm, and continued, “He found ten thousand phenomena in the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron, but he must’ve used a trick to do so. So it doesn’t mean his comprehension was much higher than ours.”

Heavenly Book nodded, and said, “Even so, we can’t underestimate this person. Let’s go and greet this prodigy.”

He wore a smile with a fan in his hand as he walked over to Lin Yun. This made everyone else from the Shadow Divine Palace briefly stunned, but they still quickly followed after Heavenly Book.

“They’re going just like that?”

“The Shadow Divine Palace suffered a loss in Lin Yun’s hands. So, Heavenly Book won’t start a fight, right?”

“Hard to say. The Heaven’s Gate won’t interfere as well if they fight before the test starts.”

“It looks like they want to snatch their Flame Origin Pellets back. I wonder how Flower Burial will handle this!” Everyone’s attention shifted to Heavenly Book.

“What is that fellow trying to do?” Xiong Tiannan frowned. He had interacted with Heavenly Book before, or rather, he received a one-sided beating before. Furthermore, Heavenly Book didn’t use his full strength back then and only played with him, so this person became Xiong Tiannan’s nightmare. Hence, Xiong Tiannan would become nervous whenever he saw Heavenly Book.

On the other hand, Lin Yun was calm and composed as the Shadow Divine Palace approached them without restraining their aura. The faces of Ji Zixi and Lin Jiangxian became grave and went on alert.

However, Heavenly Book didn’t act as everyone had expected but was elegant instead. He was blatant, and said, “You must be Flower Burial Lin Yun. Are there any Flame Origin Pellets and Divine Dragon Destiny Pellets left? It’s not easy for my junior brothers, and I wonder if you can give me some face...”

“Nope,” Lin Yun replied, leaving Shangguan Jue and Zhao Zhanli stumped. Not only them but everyone else in the surrounding area was also dumbfounded. After all, Heavenly Book was pretty polite and wasn’t aloof.

Lin Yun continued, “They’re mine, and there’s no reason for me to return them. If you want them... use other treasures to exchange for them. Furthermore, Shangguan Jue is the one who found me to bet, and he admitted his defeat. So why poking your nose in this matter?”

Heavenly Book wasn’t furious after hearing what Lin Yun said, but smiled, “This is why I asked if you could give me some face and return the remaining pellets. We can still be friends if you do.”

“I already said no.” Lin Yun looked at Heavenly Book, and continued, “You have to understand this. Regardless of the Flame Origin Pellets or the Divine Dragon Destiny Pellets, they belong to me and have nothing to do with your Shadow Divine Palace. Understood?”

If he had to give everyone face here, it would be no different from being openly snatched from. Who knows if a Divine Clan’s prince might come forth the next moment and ask him to give him some face?

“You’re really as arrogant as rumored.” Heavenly Book dropped his smile, and coldly said, “I heard that you didn’t even place the Divine Clans in your eyes and dug out seven of their disciples’ saint origins. I didn’t expect that you didn’t even place the Shadow Divine Palace in your eyes as well.”

Mockery flashed through Lin Yun’s eyes, and Ji Zixi was furious. She questioned, “What are you trying to express? Don’t make it sound like Big Brother Lin is the villain here. Or do you want to take revenge for the Divine Clans? The Divine Clans started it first, repeatedly provoking Big Brother Lin.

“Furthermore, they were the ones who wanted to dig Big Brother Lin’s saint origin first. As for your Shadow Divine Palace? What’s the matter? You guys can’t afford to take a loss?”

Ji Zixi was furious because he knew that her Big Brother Lin didn’t like to talk about that, and he was always looking like a villain to others.

Heavenly Book was briefly stunned. He was amazed by Ji Zixi’s beauty at first glance, before he smiled, “What a sharp-tongued lady. Lin Yun, you don’t think that too, right?”

“Of course not,” Lin Yun smiled. “There’s something I disagree with, so let me correct it. I didn’t place the Shadow Divine Palace in my eyes, and you’re right.”

His words caused an uproar because no one expected that there would be such dense gunpowder between them, and Heavenly Book also didn’t expect Lin Yun to have such a strong stance.

Heavenly Book initially wanted to show his ‘goodwill,’ hoping Lin Yun could give him some face or at least another bet.

“Chief, there’s no need to waste time speaking with him, just teach him a lesson!” Zhao Zhanli was furious.

“He’s not wrong, and you can make your move. But... it’s uncertain who will be taught a lesson.” Lin Yun fearlessly raised his brow.

Heavenly Book’s face changed when he looked at Lin Yun’s eyes, which felt like he was looking at a bright sun. If someone else looked into Lin Yun’s eyes, they would be incinerated.

But Lin Yun still wore a smile with his sword intent in his eyes. When he released his Quasi-Bright Sun Sword Intent, he gave off an aura that was no weaker than Heavenly Book.

Heavenly Book was shocked because he felt a stinging pain in his eyes from Lin Yun’s sword intent. If Lin Yun’s sword intent was only at Quasi-Bright Sun Sword Intent, it made no sense for it to be so strong.

When they looked at each other, a booming sound echoed in their minds as if they had just crossed hands earlier.

In the end, Heavenly Book didn’t choose to make a move, but smiled, “It’s fine for youngsters to be arrogant, but there won’t be any good outcome if you’re too arrogant.”

He left when he was done speaking and didn’t allow Lin Yun to reply. But when he turned around, the smile disappeared, replaced with a chill.

After Heavenly Book left, Ao Jue couldn’t help smiling, “This is the first time I saw such an ugly expression on his face.”

“That’s Heavenly Book we’re talking about. Will we be fine? I’m a little afraid,” Xiong Tiannan said nervously.

“That person is strong?” Ji Zixi asked.

Ao Jue nodded, “Unbelievably strong. He grasped the Great Solar Dao and formed the Great Solar Domain with the Great Solar True Flame. His attainment in Great Solar Dao is even more unfathomable than Lin Yun’s Sword Dao.”

Ji Zixi was shocked, before she said, “It’s no wonder why I felt pressure from him with my Phoenix Sacred Flame being suppressed.”

Lin Jiangxian said with a grave expression, “What Ao Jue said isn’t wrong; he’s proficient in the Great Solar Dao.”

“I was taught a lesson by him in an ancient tomb back then, and his Great Solar True Flame is terrifying. Even the Shadow Divine Palace’s Divine Son might not be any stronger than him,” Xiong Tiannan said with lingering fear.

“Sounds powerful,” Lin Yun smiled, but he didn’t look afraid.

Xiong Tiannan couldn’t help asking, “Is there a need for you to take it so far? He’s probably here to probe with no hostility.”

Lin Yun turned to look at Xiong Tiannan when he heard that, and Xiong Tiannan’s heart throbbed. He asked, “Did I speak wrongly?”

“Is there a possibility that I’m not the one offending him but the other way around?” Lin Yun smiled.

“This...” Xiong Tiannan was dumbfounded since he never thought of that before. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“I’m just joking. I have a good temper, and I won’t do anything to him, even if he offends me. Hahaha!” Lin Yun laughed.

Xiong Tiannan awkwardly smiled, but he naturally wouldn’t believe what Lin Yun said. The seven from the Divine Clans proved what would happen when someone offended Lin Yun. When he looked at Ao Jue, he instantly understood what Ao Jue was trying to say; the latter shared the same thoughts as him.

Suddenly, Lin Yun’s sword sea trembled as his sword stars uncontrollably released their sword intent. He instantly sensed that a powerful swordsman was around, and it was rare for him to encounter another swordsman that made even his sword intent afraid.

“Those from the Heavenly Sword Pavilion are here!” Lin Jiangxian whispered in Lin Yun’s ears. She was naturally referring to those from the headquarters, and the headquarters was filled with geniuses and even had several deities around.

Not only did Lin Yun’s group feel it, but all the swordsmen felt it as well. No swordsman wouldn’t know about the Sword Dao Holy Land, Heavenly Sword Pavilion.
