Chapter 783 - Sword like Lightning

Feng Wudao’s aura grew even stronger under the thunderclouds and he looked at Lin Yun coldly. “There’s nothing impressive about your sword intent. Others might fear you, but I don’t!”

He had been paying attention to Lin Yun, especially when Lin Yun battled Bai Ling. The sword intent that Lin Yun revealed, in the end, had shocked him. That battle also raised Lin Yun’s fame above his, which he didn’t like. Many people even feel that they weren’t on the same level and that Lin Yun was better than him.

In the depths of Feng Wudao’s heart, he wanted to show them how strong he was. So when he revealed his terrifying lightning intent, everyone was truly shocked. Those who were watching the battle became silent.

“Cut the crap and attack.” Lin Yun said. It was true that there was nothing impressive about sword intent, but it was different for each person. For example, Bai Ling’s sword intent was nothing in front of him. Even if they both used lesser mastery xiantian sword intent, Lin Yun was confident he could suppress his opponent. After all, there was no competition when it came to their comprehension and talent.

“Lightning Desolate Tribulation!” Feng Wudao wasn’t weak by any means since he could come this far. He circulated his origin energy and slammed his palm at Lin Yun. A purple light radiated from his hand with this attack as lightning flashed through the sky.

A huge palm shined brightly across the horizon that descended towards the stage. The entire stage began to tremble while Lin Yun’s clothes fluttered violently in the wind. It looked like he was about to go flying, which meant the palm was extremely powerful.

But an even more brilliant light tore the huge palm apart. The palm landed on the stage in two pieces next to Lin Yun. Lin Yun’s body lingered with lightning as he stood in the middle of the split palm, but he had no injuries.

Feng Wudao was briefly stunned, but he had already expected that this move wouldn’t be able to injure Lin Yun. With a flash, he unleashed more attacks that he had been accumulating.

But Lin Yun weaved through the attacks easily and his sword would fly out like bolts of lightning at Feng Wudao’s attacks.

“Damn it!” Feng Wudao’s face changed. He realized that although his lightning intent was slightly stronger than Lin Yun’s sword intent, his attacks were easily resolved whenever they reached Lin Yun. If this carried on, his origin energy would get exhausted. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

When that happened, he would be devoured by Lin Yun’s sword intent. He knew that he had to end the battle as quickly as possible. Understanding the reason why Bai Ling lost, he decided to bring out his trump card. The thunderclouds began to tumble through the sky violently as Feng Wudao screamed, “Thundercloud Storm!”

Thunderclouds that were three hundred meters large floated down like cotton. Although they looked soft, they were colossal. Then, another powerful wind blew at Lin Yun. There was no flaw in this attack and Feng Wudao was confident that Lin Yun would get swept up. After all, it was common knowledge that a swordsman's physical body wasn’t strong. So they would be useless if their sword intent shattered.

Overlord Sword—Thunderbolt Slash!

Lin Yun took a step forward and unleashed eighteen lightning bolts from his sword. Every single one of those lightning filled sword rays flew into the sky at blinding speed. In the next second, the thunderclouds were left with eighteen huge holes.

When Lin Yun spun his right hand, the eighteen sword rays overlapped and tore the thunderclouds apart like a piece of cloth. After this, the thunderclouds were thoroughly destroyed. Then again, those with better eyesight could tell that this was because Feng Wudao’s lightning intent was destroyed. With the foundation destroyed, the thunderclouds naturally couldn’t hold themselves together.

The Flower Burial Sword drew an arclight in the air before returning to its sheath. The arclight was the combination of all eighteen lightning bolt sword rays.

Feng Wudao was strong. Even with his lightning intent destroyed, he still managed to avoid most of the attacks. But even so, he still suffered from three swords. Two sword rays pierced through his shoulders and the last sword ray landed on his chest, which destroyed the origin energy he used to protect himself. Just like that, Feng Wudao flew through the air like a punching bag and was tossed to the edge of the stage.

All of this happened in the blink of an eye. In the crowd’s eyes, Feng Wudao went flying the moment Lin Yun started sheathing his sword. By the time Lin Yun completely sheathed his sword, Feng Wudao was kneeling on the ground.

“Manifestation stage.” Everyone was dumbfounded while the elders of the overlord forces wore grave expressions. Lin Yun was able to fully control his attack and the only logical conclusion was that he had reached the manifestation stage. This also meant that Feng Wudao wasn’t on the same level as Lin Yun.

“He is a true sword genius.” The elders of the Heavenly Sword Sect and Northern Snow Manor looked at Lin Yun in appreciation. In their view, it was a disservice to make a simple comparison of Lin Yun’s sword talent to Nangong Wanyu.

The judge glanced at Lin Yun. Although he knew what Lin Yun would win, he never expected that Lin Yun would win so beautifully. The judge had never seen a sword technique more beautifully and perfectly controlled than Lin Yun’s.

“He won again. Lin Yun is really terrifying since he still has his perfect record. I really thought this was going to be a tough battle.”

“His sword intent is still at the xiantian level, but he revealed a sword technique that he’s never shown before.”

“Lin Yun is really interesting. I really want to know how many trump cards he has.” Everyone could feel their blood boiling with excitement because Lin Yun had given them many surprises. For some of them, watching Lin Yun win was even more satisfying than their own wins.

“This fellow is really popular.” Indigomoon Elysium’s Ye Qingfeng clicked his tongue in disdain.

“You’re not convinced of his strength?” Fang Hanluo smiled playfully.

“You're convinced?” Ye Qingfeng questioned coldly. “We have a high chance of running into him. I don’t want to become someone’s stepping stone, nor do I want to end my winning streak before the third round.”

Fang Hanluo held onto his chin while his eyes blazed with fighting spirit. He smiled, “I have a premonition that I will be able to unleash all of my potential if I’m able to defeat him. I might even be able to make it into the top ten.”

“You really like to dream.” Ye Qingfeng didn’t put Fang Hanluo’s words in his eyes. He thought that Fang Hanluo was a madman to seek a breakthrough in battle. If Fang Hanluo was careless, he would die a terrible death. Fang Hanluo wanted to make it into the top ten, but who knew if he could even survive until then with his current strategy.

As if to prove his own words, Ye Qingfeng only used three attacks to defeat his next opponent.

As the battle continued, the three kings and seven elites gradually revealed their strength. Simultaneously, many of the rising stars ran into each other and their winning streaks came to an end. This meant that there were fewer people who could maintain their winning streak.

Among the newly risen geniuses, Bai Lixuan, Yue Weiwei, and Zhu Qingshan’s performances were particularly bright. The profound amber aura on them was simply blinding.

Lin Yun didn’t encounter any strong opponents over the next few rounds and maintained his winning streak. His winning streak reached a total of fifteen, ten from the points round and five from the elimination round.

“Sixth round, Lin Yun…” When the judge said Lin Yun’s name, everyone waited in anticipation. At the same time, those in the fourth and seventh groups, who hadn’t faced Lin Yun, wore bitter smiles. They knew that Lin Yun was powerful, so they didn’t want to run into him.

“Sixth round, Lin Yun VS Ye Qingfeng!” When the judge announced the next fight, the atmosphere suddenly became heated. After all, Ye Qingfeng was a newly risen genius who also managed to keep his winning streak. He had performed brilliantly so far.

“They finally ran into each other.”

“Lin Yun doesn’t have many opponents in the fourth and seventh groups aside from Jue Chen, Ji Feng, Ye Qingfeng, and Fang Hanluo.”

“I wonder if Ye Qingfeng will help the Indigomoon Elysium maintain their reputation.”

Ye Qingfeng sneered inwardly when he heard the surrounding discussion. However, we walked up to the stage indifferently. Very quickly, Lin Yun also walked onto the stage.

Ye Qingfeng looked at Lin Yun with excitement in his eyes and smiled, “I’ve been looking forward to this battle.”

“You won’t feel that way for very long,” replied Lin Yun casually. Then, Ye Qingfeng’s face turned black at Lin Yun’s arrogance.
