Chapter 1321 - Invincible (1)

Everyone was shocked when they saw Lin Yun’s transformation. At this moment, they realized that Lin Yun really was Flower Burial, the strongest genius in the history of the Heavenly Path, and also the champion of the Ninth Heavenly Path! RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Qin Tian, Zhang Ting, and Jiang Lichen were completely dumbfounded, especially Qin Tian and Zhang Ting. Their jaws nearly fell off. But how could that be possible? Even now, they still couldn’t believe that Lin Yun was Flower burial.

“Lin Yun, how can he be Flower Burial…?” Qin Tian’s mind blew, and his thoughts became blank. But looking at the silver-haired youth enveloped in moonlight, who else could this be aside from Flower Burial?

Zhang Ting’s face was ugly as he recalled how he mocked Lin Yun earlier. As for Qin Tian, there was naturally nothing to say because he had initially looked down on Lin Yun, holding the latter in disdain. At this moment, the two really felt that the reason they were still alive was thanks to Lin Yun having a good temper.

“So, Junior Brother is Flower Burial.” Jiang Lichen was also speechless. The shock that he felt wasn’t any weaker than Qin Tian and Zhang Ting. He was very shocked, but he also found it reasonable when he thought about it carefully.

After all, Lin Yun had climbed to the summit of the Sword Saint Mountain back in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, not to mention that he also succeeded in the challenge at the Hidden Sword Pavilion. Then, Lin Yun won the Suspend King Palace for the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect during the Profound Azure Prefecture’s ranking battle. All of them were incredible feats, but it was understandable if he was Flower Burial.

“What’s going on?” Lei Jue from the Profound Sky Sect, who was responsible for stopping Mu Qingqing from entering the Silversnow Mountain Range, had a huge change on his face. Although he didn’t join the fight going on in the Silversnow Mountain Range, he had been secretly paying attention to the situation.

So he was left dumbfounded when he personally saw Lin Yun put on the Silver Moon Mask. He couldn’t believe that Flower Burial had really been staying in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect under everyone’s eyes. Back then, when Lin Yun snatched the Dragon Blood Fruit outside the Profound Wither island, many people paid attention to his existence, but none of them were too interested in him.

“Surprised?” Mu Qingqing smiled. She had already speculated the possibility, but she never expected that her speculation was real.

“So what?” Lei Jue coldly replied. “Facing eight Greater Elysium Core Realm experts alone, he’ll only lose his life like a fool.”

“Don’t be so sure about that. You have no idea how tough it is on the Heavenly Path, not to mention becoming the champion. He practically killed his way through millions of people, and none of the historical champions of the Heavenly Paths were pushovers. Don’t forget that he’s known to be the strongest champion in the history of the Heavenly Paths!” Mu Qingqing smiled, seemingly confident in Lin Yun.

“Let us wait and see, then…” Lei Jue tugged his arms together and didn’t seem to be bothered by it. His eyes were also flickering with faint killing intent.

In his view, Lin Yun was simply too arrogant, daring to come while knowing that there was a trap waiting for him. So he was waiting to see how Lin Yun would beg for mercy later.

Outside the Profound Wither Island, everyone was also left shocked when they saw this scene. They couldn’t believe that not only was Flower Burial on the island, but he even wore his mask to openly prove his identity after slapping the big sects’ transcendent geniuses.

He clearly knew that the eight big sects had prepared a trap for him, but he still dared to show up before them.

“So he ultimately couldn’t hold it in.” Feng Jue smiled while he stroked his beard.

He knew that Lin Yun must have had a terrible time enduring it all for the past six months. He was clearly the champion of the Ninth Heavenly Path, but he could only be holed up in a small place like the Profound Azure Prefecture after arriving in the Kunlun Realm.

It would be a lie if Lin Yun didn’t have any grievances. After all, he long had it when he slaughtered his way through the Heavenly Path and faced the ten realm sons. So today, he would show everyone who Flower Burial was!

Back at the Silversnow Mountain Range, the faces of the eight Greater Elysium Core Realm experts were ugly, and it took them some time to accept this reality. It turned out that Flower Burial was already here.

“What arrogance!” The old man from the Flame Dragon Sect roared, “So what if you’re Flower Burial? Do you really think that you’re at the Elysium Core Realm with an origin saint rune engraved on your elysium core to face the eight of us alone?”

His injuries were pretty heavy, but his hatred grew even further, and he was the first to charge at Lin Yun. Stomping his foot in mid-air, golden flaming runes bloomed as he dashed forth in a flash.

The flaming runes in mid-air were emitting an ancient aura. Clearly, this was an ancient secret technique that could fuse the Flame Saint Rune and space together.

At the same time, the other seven elders from the big sects also made their moves. They no longer held back and charged at Lin Yun together. If they were really defeated by him today, then the faces of the eight big sects would be completely humiliated. In the future, the big sects would have difficulty raising their heads before others.

A silver streak tore across space. It was the old man from the Silverblood Elysium that attacked first. He had a silver saint rune flickering on his palm that bloomed with dazzling lightning, instantly lighting everything within a thousand mile radius up.

Lin Yun was donned in silver moonlight as he moved about in mid-air. Whenever he took a step, there would be a Demonic Astral Flower blooming beneath his feet. It didn’t take long for the sea of clouds to overlap and disperse the Flame Saint Rune that the grey-clothed old man had unleashed.

Then, he trust his fingers like a sharp sword at the silver-haired old man’s palm. In the next second, a silver light exploded, leaving everyone shocked. It was simply too terrifying to use two fingers to face the secret technique of the Silverblood Elysium.

As Lin Yun’s silver hair draped down on his shoulders like a waterfall, he casually stepped out in mid-air and exhibited invincible grace with every movement.

Right at that moment, the Greater Elysium Core Realm from the Azure Thunder Sect charged over. He wielded a saint sword, while having both lightning and flames flickering on the surface of his body. In the next second, he unleashed countless sword rays at Lin Yun, and each of his sword rays had a mixed combination of lightning and flames.

A pair of golden wings that had reached the size of ten feet unfolded behind Lin Yun. He then used his fingers to execute the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords. Each of his attacks would unleash a sea of clouds behind him, flickering with saint light and emitting an ancient aura.

Ten-odd moves later, Lin Yun flicked his fingers and unleashed terrifying ray of lights. When his attack clashed with the saint sword wielded by the elder from the Azure Thunder Sect, cracks began to appear on the saint sword. Suddenly, the light released by the sword reached its peak before the sword exploded with fragments flying about.

The other seven Greater Elysium Core Realm experts all made their moves at the same time to resist the shockwave with their full strength. But even so, the powerful impact still forced them to take ten-odd steps back.

They all had a single thought flashing across their minds at this moment. Lin Yun was simply too heaven-defyingly strong, regardless of his cultivation, physique, or sword techniques, they had surpassed the limit of a Quasi-Elysium Core Realm.

But they were also fortunate because they weren’t ordinary Greater Elysium Core Realm experts. If they were, then they wouldn’t even last more than ten moves under Lin Yun.

“Bring out your constellations!” The middle-aged woman from the Flame Phoenix Sect roared with killing intent flashing through her pupils. She was the first person who summoned her constellation, and her constellation was a flame enveloped in holy light.

When the painting unfolded behind her, the blizzard in the surroundings was instantly devoured by a sea of flames while she turned into a gorgeous phoenix that pounced at Lin Yun. At the same time, the other seven Greater Elysium Core Realm experts also brought out their constellations, enveloping the entire sky in boundless radiance, while a boundless pressure was pressing down on Lin Yun.

“Suppress him to death!” The eight Greater Elysium Core Realm experts roared while they pushed their constellations to the limit, unleashing the pressure onto Lin Yun.

This wasn’t an ordinary means. This allowed them to take the advantage in their cultivation to the limit. At times when they were facing heaven-defying geniuses, this could catch them by surprise by doing this. But it was a pity that it was Lin Yun whom they ran into.

“What pitiful tricks!” Lin Yun said indifferently before he pushed his palm out. At the same time, a golden painting also unfolded behind him.

With a pair of eyes like the sun and moon, freezing all of eternity with one thought.

When the painting unfolded, an immense pressure spread out as an Aurora Dragon appeared. Sensing the great power from his constellation empowering him, Lin Yun’s cultivation that was at the Quasi-Elysium Core Realm began to rise rapidly.

The eight Greater Elysium Core Realm experts who wanted to suppress Lin Yun to death threw out mouthfuls of blood as they were sent flying away.
