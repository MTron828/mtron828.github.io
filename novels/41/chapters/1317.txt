Chapter 1318 - Bai Luli, I'm Here For Your Life (1)

“Stop! No one is allowed to enter this path!” When Lin Yun stepped forth, those blocking the entrance barked with killing intent brewing in their pupils.

“The Silversnow Valley is sealed? Why didn’t I hear of that?” Qin Tian asked.

“Who do you think you are? The valley is sealed by the eight big sects, and anyone who enters will die!” They had pride on their faces when they looked at Qin Tian with annoyance.

“Aren’t you guys waiting for me? Here I am, so why am I not allowed to enter?” Lin Yun replied with his face terrifyingly calm.

“Who the hell are you? Get lost!” One of the guards roared.

“J-Junior Brother Lin…” Jiang Lichen raised his head when he heard a familiar voice before he quickly continued, “Junior Brother, leave quickly!”

“Lin Yun?” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“What?! Quick, inform the elders!” The faces of the big sect’s disciples changed and quickly charged forth.

As a pair of golden wings unfolded behind Lin Yun, a powerful thunderstorm swept out and those who tried to flee all threw a mouthful of blood before they fell to the ground. This scene made Qin Tian and Zhang Ting’s scalps go numb because they had no idea what Lin Yun had obtained in the past month for him to be so terrifyingly strong.

He was an entirely different person from before. One must know that the disciples of the big sects were all at the Elysium Core Realm. Even if they were only at the Initial Elysium Core Realm, none of them were weak.

Lin Yun came forth and helped Jiang Lichen up before he continued to enter the valley. The Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s disciples were his bottom line, and Luo Hua was the bottom line of his bottom line. They were being surrounded right now, and there was no way Lin Yun would take this lying down. So he was here today to kill, and death to those who stand in his way.

Along the way, Lin Yun knew that Jiang Lichen was captured because he covered everyone. Ye Ziling was currently refining an origin saint rune, and they retreated to the valley so they were safe for now.

“Let’s go!” Lin Yun didn’t say a single word and continued forth. On the other side, Jiang Lichen was totally shocked by the strength that Lin Yun had revealed.

“Lin Yun?” They quickly ran into the disciples of the other sects. They were blocking this place, and they began to confirm Lin Yun’s appearance with the paintings in their hands. But before they could speak more, Lin Yun had turned into a golden streak and charged forth. His hair began to flutter in the wind with a draconic roar echoing from his body while being accompanied by a dragon aura and sword vibration.

This made those disciples exclaim before they drew their weapons and charged forth. But Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon Saint Art had undergone a transformation. He threw his punch forth, easily turning those people into a dense blood mist.

Lin Yun continued forth, killing anyone that stood in his way. Just like that, anyone who dared to attack him was killed before they could even scream for help. The outer region of the valley had elite disciples of the big sects with no transcendent geniuses around.

According to Jiang Lichen, the big sects’ transcendent geniuses were in the valley. Not only were they waiting, but they also wanted to snatch the origin saint rune that was there.

“Lin Yun is here!” Half an hour later, Lin Yun’s tracks were discovered and someone quickly yelled out to alarm everyone. In the next second, countless figures soared into the sky of the valley and charged over.

Seeing this scene, the faces of Qin Tian, Zhang Ting, and Jiang Lichen became pale. There were a little too many people. Although they knew that the eight big sects had joined forces, they still couldn’t help being shocked by this scene.

“Not a single transcendent?” Lin Yun locked his brows together. When Qin Tian heard what he said, the corner of his lips twitched. He wondered if Lin Yun really was this insane.

“Kill him!” Within the blizzard, countless people charged towards Lin Yun with their killing auras spreading out.

But Lin Yun was fearless. He circulated his Azure Dragon Saint Art and took a step forth. When he unleashed his killing aura, half of the sky was dyed red. After all, he had killed thousands in his path of cultivation, and today, he was determined to start a slaughter and dye this valley in blood.

His shocking killing aura instantly captivated everyone, and this gave them a feeling as though this swordsman came from hell. This made all those big sect disciples feel a chill down their spines, and they began to tremble.

“What’s going on?”

“There’s no need to be afraid. With the eight sects joining forces, we’re enough to suppress this demon!” They managed to suppress the fear in their hearts with their advantage in numbers before they began to unleash boundless starlight in the sky of the valley.

Seven Flowers Convergence!

Lin Yun instantly summoned forty-nine flowers from his body. The golden Demonic Astral Flowers made Lin Yun look ethereal and immortal. When he charged over, sword rays began to radiate from his body, and he had immediately unleashed his attacks.

Shortly after, the dragon runes flew from his body. Empowered by the Seven Flowers Convergence, the runes shone brightly, and those who were charging over threw out mouthfuls of blood before they began to fall from the sky like broken kites. In this brief moment, there were thirty-odd corpses on the ground, and their chests were pierced by dragon runes.

After they died, the dragon runes in their bodies returned to Lin Yun. Just like that, Lin Yun continued to shine with purple-golden light, making him look like a deity.

This scene made Qin Tian and Zhang Ting feel uneasy. This made them wonder if Lin Yun wanted to bulldoze his way through all by himself, sweeping through the eight big sects alone. This was simply too unimaginable, and this left their mouths wide open.

When those in the surroundings saw this scene, they were so terrified that their faces were pale as they began to back off. But Lin Yun didn’t bother about them. His gaze had fallen on the center of the valley.

Hearing the zither music coming from there, the music sounded like it was crying and passionate at the same time. This made Lin Yun’s face change with his fists tightly clenched together under his sleeves.

“Lin Yun, you really showed up! I’ve been waiting for you for a long time!” Right at that moment, a figure soared into the sky.

“Bai Luli!” Lin Yun looked at the culprit who gathered the eight big sects. At this moment, he regretted that he didn’t deal with Bai Luli earlier. If he had known this would happen, he would’ve killed Bai Luli no matter what, even if he had to expose his firmament sword intent.

“Did you come here to die?” Bai Luli sneered. He knew that Lin Yun would come, and he wasn’t worried at all.

“Since you want to die, then I’ll fulfill your wish.” Lin Yun spread his arms apart and soared toward Bai Luli.

This made the hearts of Qin Tian and the rest sink. Since Bai Luli was fearless, this was enough to prove that there was a trap waiting for Lin Yun. As their faces changed, they quickly followed after him.

“Hahaha! Good, I’ve been waiting for you!” Bai Luli laughed with mockery flashing across his pupils.

Lin Yun’s speed was fast, and it didn’t take long for him to descend. This was a spacious plain, and the ground was covered in snow. Bai Luli was standing on a hill, looking down at Lin Yun. The Silversnow Valley was just behind Bai Luli, and it was enveloped in a mist with zither music resounding.

Sensing that they might be over there, Lin Yun felt relieved since they were safe for now, and he wasn’t late. Suddenly, six figures appeared around Bai Luli. They were the transcendent geniuses from the other sects emitting immense pressure. Aside from Dugu Yan of the Azure Thunder Sect, the transcendents of the eight big sects were all gathered here.

But that wasn’t all. Several more people were emitting a dazzling light. They were Greater Elysium Core Realm experts, and this was the foundation of the big sects. There were eight of them wielding a saint artifact each, hovering in the sky like deities.
