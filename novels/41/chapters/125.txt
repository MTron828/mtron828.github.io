Chapter 126 - Seal Opens

The Sword Condors were arrogant Xiantian Realm demonic beasts. Their lifespan was only ten years long, but they would grow into Profound Martial Realm demonic beasts if they managed to break through the limit.

Ten years was just the blink of an eye for demonic beasts, but for Sword Condors, it represented their entire life.

Meaning, they would either die after ten years or grow into Profound Martial Realm demonic beasts. Throughout the Great Qin Empire, only a sect could tame these lofty demonic beasts.

As for the Sword Condors, they were the symbol of the Sword Firmament Pavilion!

Among the four great sects in the Great Qin Empire, only the Sword Firmament Pavilion was founded upon swords. Everyone in the sect was an expert at using swords and their talent in it was astonishing. It was the holy land for swordsmen.

Since Lin Yun wanted to join the four great sects, he naturally knew about the Sword Firmament Pavilion. When he looked at the Sword Condors, he started feeling excited.

Out of the four great sects - Sword Firmament Pavilion, Primal Origin Sect, Heavenly Profound Sect, and Demonic Moon Villa - Lin Yun longed for the Sword Firmament Pavilion.

Just like Lin Yun, everyone’s eyes were glued on the Sword Condors when they appeared on the horizon.

Fwoosh!

The Sword Condors began to dive down, releasing an aura that could penetrate through anything. Although they were ten thousand meters high in the sky, they bolted down in an instant.

When the Sword Condors approached, their sword aura struck a deep fear in everyone’s heart. Even the atmosphere had instantly become sharp.

Swish! Swish! Swish!

The people on the Sword Condors started to descend. All of them carried swords behind them, standing like towering spears in the ground.

The sword aura that pierced through the clouds had come from them. They had relied purely on their sword aura to tear through the clouds, signifying their strength.

The one that attracted everyone’s attention the most was the first person who descended. He wore white clothes that fluttered in the wind. He stood arrogantly with his hands behind his back. Unlike other disciples who carried swords, he carried a sword box.

He was handsome and his aura was like a piercing sword. Worst of all, his aura had reached the level of the seventh orifice!

“Seventh orifice of the Xiantian Realm!” Lin Yun was stunned. This young man only looked slightly older than him, but his cultivation had reached a heaven-defying height of the seventh orifice!

Ming Ye smiled at Lin Yun’s exclamation and said, “He already reached the seventh orifice of the Xiantian Realm a year ago. If he wanted to, he could clear the Profound Martial Channel at any time. For a monstrous genius like him, the Profound Martial Realm that is far from everyone’s reach is a mere step away for him.” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Listening to Ming Ye’s words, Lin Yun was even more shocked. He asked, “Then why is he not taking that step?”

“It’s rumored that he’s accumulating himself. The Xiantian Realm is the foundation for the body. Rumor has it that if you can temper your Xiantian Realm to perfection, your physique can evolve into the Primordial Divine Physique when reaching the Profound Martial Realm. But even if you fail to evolve your physique, your accumulation will have incredible value in the Profound Martial Realm…” Ming Ye explained.

The Profound Martial Realm old man beside Ming Ye sighed, “It’s beyond the reach of ordinary people and only true monstrous geniuses can do this. If ordinary people mimicked them, they might miss the opportunity to clear the Profound Martial Channel in their lifetime.”

Looking at the genius, Ming Ye replied, “But he, Bai Lixuan, has the qualification to do so… But I never would have expected him to lead the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s party.”

When Mei Zihua and Xue Tu looked at Bai Lixuan, their eyes were flickered with admiration as well. Bai Lixuan’s name was well known, even in a remote place like the Azure Sun County. In the entire Great Qin Empire, he was one of the most dazzling monstrous geniuses.

Bai Lixuan ignored the exclamations that rang out from his arrival. He looked at the two ancient statues while an unparalleled aura emitted from his body.

Lin Yun calmed himself down. Someone like Bai Lixuan was someone that he had to look up to. However, he had no intention of submitting on his knees. This matter planted a sapling of fighting spirit in his heart.

Someone like Mei Zihua or Xue Tu could only pale in comparison to Bai Lixuan. Lin Yun’s arrogance from his fight with the two before had disappeared. There was a saying that there was always someone better in the world.

The Azure Sun County that he had seen so far was only the tip of the iceberg.

Boom!

Suddenly, another terrifying aura surged in the sky. A floating ship flew through the sky with a purple moon banner hanging on the ship’s bow that fluttered in the wind.

“The Demonic Moon Villa!” Everyone immediately guessed the origin of that ship when they saw the banner. It was one of the four great sects, the Demonic Moon Villa.

The Demonic Moon Villa’s background was stronger than the Sword Firmament Pavilion. Rumor had it that the Demonic Moon Villa originated from an ancient sacred land in Profound Amber and that they were a branch from the sacred land.

At the same time, they were also the most mysterious among the four great sects. They have always behaved mysteriously like lone wolves who didn’t like interacting with others.

The ship flew majestically towards the two statues before descending in front of the entrance.

That location was already occupied by other forces, but those forces immediately left when they saw the Demonic Moon Villa’s ship.

A party stepped out of the ship and was led by a man clothed in purple. His cultivation wasn’t inferior to Bai Lixuan in any way since he too was in the seventh orifice of the Xiantian Realm. His purple clothes were dazzling and he noticeably held onto a fan. His presence was unfathomable, righteous, and devilish all at the same time.

“Si Xueyi… that fellow came as well!” Ming Ye’s face drastically changed and became unnatural. It was something that never happened even with Bai Lixuan.

Standing beside him, Lin Yun was feeling curious.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Suddenly, a huge sound rang out that was accompanied by a terrifying aura. A group of cultivators came riding on huge beasts.

All of them were wearing the same decorations and all of them were terrifying, especially the beasts that they were riding. They had the aura of primordial beasts that terrified the nearby horses.

“It’s one of the four clans, the Wang Clan!”

There were four great clans in the Great Qin Empire. There was the Zhou, Wang, Lin, and Li clan who all had over a few thousand years of inheritance. They were all founded with the empire and their strength came in second only after the royal clan.

They were part of the royal clan’s method to keep the four sects in check. They each dominated a land in the empire and received transcendent positions.

With an unusual expression, Ming Ye muttered, “Did the news leak? It was already a surprise for one of the four clans and four sects to come in the past, but three of them came this time. The Demonic Moon Villa and Sword Firmament Pavilion even dispatched their best Xiantian Realm disciples to lead the team!”

“Perhaps it’s a coincidence…” The old man beside him spoke out.

However, Ming Ye knitted his brows and shook his head, “I don’t believe in coincidence. Let’s prepare for the worst.”

The two of them were chatting secretly, so Lin Yun had no idea what they were talking about. At this moment, he glanced at a cultivator from the Wang Clan’s party and his face changed drastically.

It was Wang Ning!

Within the Wang Clan’s party, Wang Ning sat in the middle of everyone with a high and mighty look. His aura was unrecognizable when compared to his time in the Azure Sky Sect.

However, Lin Yun still recognized him. He slowly lost control of his killing intent as he recalled how Senior Hong had died. He never expected that he would meet Wang Ning here.

At the same time, Wang Ning had undergone a complete transformation as the Wang Clan’s direct descendant!

“What’s the matter? You see an enemy of yours?” smiled Ming Ye.

“Nah.” Lin Yun replied with a smile. His heart might be filled with hatred, but he knew that he couldn’t show it right now. After all, the four clans were transcendent existences to him.

In the Great Qin Empire, many people were willing to sell their lives to them without needing to be asked. If others knew that he had enmity with a Wang Clan’s direct descendant, it wouldn’t be as simple as offending the Blood Cloud Sect.

“I have a deal, I wonder if you’re interested?” Ming Ye asked.

“What deal?” Lin Yun raised his brow.

Looking around, Ming Ye whispered, “Now’s not the time. I’ll tell you about it if you can stay alive in the Azure Sun Realm.”

Lin Yun squinted his eyes. Ming Ye seemed to know some secrets about the Azure Sun Realm.

“Sir Ming, you do know how to keep someone in suspense,” said Lin Yun.

“The Azure Sun Realm is filled with danger. If you can’t even last a few days, then there’s no meaning for me to tell you about it. But judging by the current situation, it’s doubtful if I can last that long as well…” Ming Ye smiled before he sighed, “Let’s hope that there won’t be anyone else from the four sects and four clans.”

As time passed, the sun started to descend and the horizon was dyed red. Maybe Ming Ye’s prayers came true because no one else from the four sects and four clans came.

However, the Azure Sun Realm’s seal still showed no signs of opening, making everyone anxious.

Sizzle! Sizzle!

Just when everyone’s patience was running out, an abnormal fluctuation started spreading out. Simultaneously, the ancient energy in the air began to spread out along with the ripple.

Crack!

The two statues started to move outside of the valley. They each raised one hand that carried boundless power and joined their palms together.

“The seal is opening!”
