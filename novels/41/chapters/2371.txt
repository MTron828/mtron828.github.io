Chapter 2372 - Golden Spirit Core

“Flower Burial, you should rest since you’re exhausted and leave everything to us,” Heavenly Book added. As for the other geniuses, they maintained silent, acknowledging Jiang Ziyao and Heavenly Book’s words as their gaze fell onto Lin Yun.

On the Heavenly Barren Saint Mountain, this scene caused an uproar.

“They’re going to isolate Lin Yun?”

“Isn’t Jiang Ziyao too shameless?”

“Lin Yun was the one who killed the Blood Conceal King, and yet they’re going to kick him away?”

“Not only that, but I even suspect that they’ve planned this beforehand.” All the cultivators were left dumbfounded, having never expected this scene. After all, Lin Yun had won many people’s acknowledgment with his performance, so everyone naturally sympathized with him when he was treated this way.

“These people are too much. They plan to isolate Lin Yun just because they’re from different backgrounds?”

“The Kunlun Realm was famous throughout the universe back then!”

“This is too much!”

Within the Nether Woods Mountain Range, Lin Yun calmly looked at these people, and asked, “What are you guys talking about? I don’t understand.”

When the Blood Conceal King attacked him, he already had a plan, so he was waiting for this moment. He wasn’t afraid of them, nor would he let them snatch the golden spirit core from him.

“Lin Yun, are we not clear enough?” Jiang Ziyao smiled coldly. “We’re saying that you can leave now, immediately!”

Heavenly Book sneered, “We’ve known each other for a long time, and we’re all geniuses on the Brandished Dragon Ranking. Do you think you’re on the same level as us just because you’re somewhat capable?”

They were bullying and isolating Lin Yun. Since there was a competition, they naturally had to kick Lin Yun out first.

“Brat, leave immediately and return to your Kunlun Realm. The universe doesn’t welcome you,” Tuoba Hong said rudely. His grey hair fluttered in the wind, making him look ferocious. He also had a moon imprint on his forehead, which was the symbol of the Heavenly Moonhowl Wolf.

The other geniuses said nothing with indifference on their faces, stating their attitude. They wouldn’t come up with a vicious plan by themselves, but they wouldn’t reject it if someone came up with it.

Lin Yun smiled, “You think that I’ve reached my limit? Do you think I’m foolish enough to leave after dealing with the Blood Conceal King? I might have a good temper, but not to this extent...”

“Who do you think you are to speak? You have long become a sore in my eyes. A lowly swordsman dares to interact with the genius of my Heavenly Sword Pavilion? Do you think that I don’t have any temper?” Jiang Ziyao sneered, no longer continuing with his act.

Qin Yun said, “We still have to think about how we will divide this golden spirit core. If you leave now, whoever obtains the golden spirit core can give you some benefits and won’t let you return to the Kunlun Realm empty-handed. We’ve given you enough benefits, so don’t join the game between the three thousand realms.”

He might seem calm, but his tone was filled with pride that far surpassed Jiang Ziyao and Heavenly Book. In his heart, he looked down on Lin Yun from the Kunlun Realm.

Lin Yun smiled mysteriously as a flute appeared in his hand. This was the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute. He asked, “Dao Sect’s Qin Yun, do you know where we are?”

“We’re naturally in the Nether Woods Mountain Range. Do you want to buy time? There’s no meaning behind it since it’s useless before absolute strength,” Qin Yun frowned.

“Don’t waste time with him and just cripple him!” Heavenly Book waved his hand with murderous intent flashing in his eyes.

But just when they were about to make a move, Lin Yun spun the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute in his hand, and said, “We’re in an ancient battlefield, the rebirth place of the Blood Conceal King. There are countless corpses buried here...”

As he spoke, all the deathly aura in this battlefield was mobilized by the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute in Lin Yun’s hands. The battlefield began to tremble as a black, deathly aura gushed out from the ground.

“What’s going on?” The six geniuses took a few steps back and wore grave expressions.

But before they could do anything, Lin Yun placed the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute by his lips and started playing it. His clothes and hair began to flutter in the wind as the skeletons buried deep in the ground soared to the sky. They were corpses of those who had died, and they were controlled under the nourishment of a deathly aura.

Looking at the densely packed corpses in the sky, the six geniuses exclaimed, “Not good!”

“The demonic corpses are running amok!”

“Leave!” Everyone’s faces changed as they retreated. They might be able to deal with the situation if it was just a few demonic corpses, but there were too many. There were more demonic corpses appearing, and the entire battlefield was enveloped in their demonic aura.

Tuoba Hong was slightly slower and was held down by several demonic corpses with wounds appearing on his body. As he groaned, he returned to his true form, the Heavenly Moonhowl Wolf. A massive wolf appeared with a moon rising to the sky, and his aura reached a terrifying height. He was furious and started fighting with the sea of demonic corpses, “You guys are courting death!”

But there were too many demonic corpses and everyone there was furious because they plotted against Lin Yun, only to be outwitted by Lin Yun instead. Their gazes were vicious as they looked at Lin Yun.

Lin Yun was playing the Phoenix Heart Song while being enveloped in moonlight, making him look sacred. The aura that he gave off also made all the demonic corpses ignore him.

“Damn it!”

“He must’ve planned this!”

“This place is a huge trap, and we should’ve realized that!” The six geniuses were furious, but there was nothing they could do about it. There was an ancient array beneath the ancient battlefield, containing boundless deathly aura and corpses.

Everyone was cautious in the beginning, but they became complacent after Lin Yun fell for their trap and forgot about it. As a result, they were facing their retribution now.

Lin Yun retreated to the side and was speechless when he saw this scene. He expected that there would be demonic corpses here, but he didn’t think that there would be so much.

“Mhm?” Lin Yun noticed that the golden spirit core was turning into a streak of light. He smiled as he flew over, “I knew that you’re not entirely dead!”

Lin Yun was enveloped in moonlight, and yet the demonic corpses ignored him even though he had stopped playing the Phoenix Heart Song. Now, he only had to obtain the golden spirit core to become the final winner.

“After him!” Jiang Ziyao and Mu Qianxue broke free from the demonic corpses and chased after Lin Yun. They were fast, and the huge amount of demonic corpses didn’t hold them down.

“Flower Burial, impressive!” Mu Qianxue smiled. Who could’ve thought that Lin Yun would have such a high attainment in music?

Jiang Ziyao and Mu Qianxue were both eighth-stage Saint Lords, and the primordial aura in their violet palaces had formed into stars.

Mu Qianxue was so fast, he was even faster than Lin Yun. As he laughed, the stars shone in his violet palace, and he caught up with Lin Yun, “The golden spirit core is mine!”

This scene naturally made Jiang Ziyao anxious. As for Mu Qianxue, he was excited and wore a smile because the golden spirit core would be his soon.

But then Lin Yun suddenly turned around and faced Mu Qianxue head-on.

Seeing this, Mu Qianxue smiled, “Have you resigned yourself to your fate?”

But his smile soon froze because he didn’t notice when a flower appeared on Lin Yun’s shoulder. That was the Othershore Flower. As the flower emitted an aroma, it made Mu Qianxue dazzled. Before the latter could even react, Lin Yun’s palm landed on his chest, sending Mu Qianxue flying away and throwing out blood. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“You!” Mu Qianxue’s face changed, and he was so furious that he threw out another mouthful of blood.

“You can’t even withstand a flower? Mu Qianxue, it looks like you’re lacking.” Jiang Ziyao laughed when he saw this scene, and he took the opportunity to chase after Lin Yun.

But in the next second, five beams descended from the sky, each representing a different element. As they intertwined, they formed into a sky with a powerful pressure as a figure appeared, “Heavenly Divine Sword!”

This person was naturally Lin Jiangxian, who used her incomplete Five Elements Dao and pushed the Heavenly Divine Sword to the limit. This caught Jiang Ziyao by surprise as he took the attack head-on.

“Lin Jiangxian!” Jiang Ziyao’s face changed with disbelief. He couldn’t believe that not only did Lin Jiangxian stand on Lin Yun’s side, but she even helped Lin Yun by attacking him. But that wasn’t all. Ji Zixi arrived with a pair of wings behind her, fully circulating the Heavenly Phoenix Maiden’s bloodline.

“Divine Phoenix Fire!” Ji Zixi was like a deity with the divine seal on her forehead blooming as she dived down like a phoenix. When she landed on the ground, the fire not only stopped Jiang Ziyao, but the other geniuses as well.

Several people tried to charge through the fire, but they discovered that the fire would stick onto them like a parasite if they came in contact with it. This was a shocking scene and even Heavenly Book’s face changed, not daring to give it a try.

“That’s the Divine Phoenix Fire! She has activated her bloodline!” Heavenly Book gritted his teeth.

Lin Jiangxian and Ji Zixi flashed as they landed beside Lin Yun, who had obtained the golden spirit core.
