Chapter 1777 - Strongest Beneath The Top Ten

The phoenix cry from Zhang Yu’s body echoed incessantly, and his aura seemed to have been unsealed and began to rise rapidly. His body became red under the high temperature, accompanying this boost in his aura. Runes also began to appear on the surface of his body, and white smoke rose from the ground.

When Lin Yun looked at the ground, he realized that the high temperature was melting it.Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Scarlet Flame Cauldron!” Zhang Yu unleashed his trump card, executing the second form of the Divine Flame Fist, and the power of this attack was infinitely close to the limit of ghost spirit martial techniques.

His body was like a cauldron, and his dragon origin was the molten iron, using his Flame Intent to ignite his blood. When his physique reached the limit, his body felt like it would blow apart at any time. As he unleashed a ferocious roar, he released thirty-six punches.

Each punch was like a golden fireball, with thirty-six fireballs streaking across the horizon like meteorites dragging a long trail of flames. They had constructed into some sort of ancient mark. As the mark radiated brightly, the thirty-six fireballs combined into one, unleashing a massive aura.

This had a wide area of attack, enveloping the entire stage and not giving Lin Yun a chance to dodge unless he left the Thunderblood Battlefield. But if that was the case, this meant he had conceded.

A blazing aura swept out when the mark shone brightly, putting the entire Thunderblood Square at a high temperature. Everyone in the square was sweating profusely, and they couldn’t isolate the heat even if they covered themselves with their dragon origin. This made everyone feel as though they were being baked.

“Hmph. Lin Xiao, I prepared this strongest attack for the top ten. It cannot be dodged or destroyed even if you find the flaw. Let me see how you take this one!” Zhang Yu yelled, looking like a madman.

He knew that Lin Yun’s cultivation was only at the seventh-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, not to mention he also had strong swordsmanship and sword intent. As long as he revealed a flaw, Lin Yun could capture it. When his flaw began to expand, his attack would be dissolved, regardless of how powerful it was. This was also why Lin Yun could fight those with a higher cultivation than him.

But Lin Yun had no expression, fear, or shock.

“It looks like you don’t understand swordsmen, or me, well. If a swordsman only knows how to look for flaws, they will never be able to become a top-tiered swordsman. Every swordsman has a heart for invincibility, and I’m naturally not an exception!” Lin Yun said, and his majestic sword intent rose to the sky.

He fused his Azure Dragon Intent and Sword Intent, causing the surrounding space to distort, and visible ripples began to spread out. When Lin Yun’s sword intent roared, he stepped forward and swung his sword at the thirty-six fireballs. Nothing was fancy about this attack, he only relied on his powerful Azure Dragon Sword Intent and cultivation.

The powerful sword intent allowed Lin Yun’s aura to break through the shackles of the seventh-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, approaching the Samsara Edict Realm.

This sword was unbelievably fast, and the saint blood that dyed the battlestage was trembling as if they were afraid. As Lin Yun’s hair fluttered in the wind, his aura alone was enough to make the fireballs be on the verge of collapsing.

As a sword ray flashed, a perfect cut appeared on the thirty-six fireballs, and Zhang Yu threw out a mouthful of blood before he flew out of the Thunderblood Battlestage.

When the fireballs descended from the sky, they caused the ground to tremble, and the aftermath was like molten iron splashing around. But Lin Yun didn’t even move. The splashes couldn’t even get within three feet of him.

“Heavenly Dome Sword Intent?”

“That seems to be the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent, if I didn’t feel it wrongly…”

“It feels like it, and not at the same time. It’s more like a fusion between Azure Dragon Intent and Quasi-Heavenly Dome Sword Intent to reach the power of Heavenly Dome Sword Intent in lesser mastery.”

“That fellow is really a monster. With such talent, he actually still went to the Nirvana Banquet?” The Thunderblood Square fell into a brief silence before an uproar broke out.

After all, that was the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent they were discussing. To grasp the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent at the Dragon Pulse Realm was no different from a myth, even if Lin Yun barely reached it by combining two martial intents together.

The uproar was like a wild storm sweeping across Thunderblood Square.

In one of the holy lands’ pavilions, the Snow Master Lord looked at the Autumn Mountain Lord with surprise. He asked, “Is that really the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent? Based on his talent in sword dao, he can be considered at the top of the pyramid, even in Skysolute City or Hidden Sword Manor.”

“Doesn’t seem like it. To achieve it, he merged his Azure Dragon Sword Intent and Quasi-Heavenly Dome Sword Intent. But I bet his Azure Dragon Intent is at the pinnacle of fourth grade.” The Autumn Mountain Lord shook his head.

“Pinnacle fourth-grade!” The Four Young Masters of Heavenly Dome City gradually wore grave expressions. The other holy land geniuses had locked their brows together because Lin Yun’s appearance surprised them.

They initially thought Lin Yun was an ordinary genius, but they never expected that even Zhang Yuan would be defeated. They now had no choice but to treat this seriously, especially the Wind Edge Lord, who had his brows locked together.

He didn't treat Lin Yun at the West Garden Banquet seriously. How long has it been since then, and yet Lin Yun was already so strong?

The Heavenly Dao Sect’s Xiao Yuanqi suddenly smiled, “Wind Edge Lord, you don’t look well. Don’t tell me you’re afraid to be challenged by Lin Xiao?”

“I’d be happy to tell him what it means to be a frog in a well. There isn’t a single swordsman in the top ten on the Dragon Pulse Ranking.” The Wind Edge Lord smiled.

Lin Yun's clothes were spotless as he sheathed his sword while on the Thunderblood Battlestage. On the other hand, Zhang Yu looked pathetic after being defeated, and he threw out another mouthful of blood, seeing Lin Yun’s unscathed appearance.

Just a moment ago, he still boasted that he would defeat his opponent in one move. But the slap on his face resounded when Lin Yun forcibly resolved his attack. He began to mutter to himself, “How can I possibly lose to a musician? This makes no sense… I’m a genius of a holy land, while he’s only first on the Nirvana Banquet…”

“Zhang Yu, come back. Don’t deceive yourself any longer.” Ji Lingfeng said. He already knew Zhang Yu would lose a long time ago, but he couldn’t stop because of his persistence. So his defeat was utterly embarrassing.

“Haha. The Divine Phoenix Mountain can’t afford to lose?” Yan Chihuo of the Heavenly Flame Sect said. The Ming Cult’s Yu Wenxiu also looked at Ji Lingfeng with mockery on his face.

“Zhang Yu already lost. Holy land geniuses aren’t invincible. So don’t make yourself look like a joke to others,” said Lin Qingyang from the Divine Dao Pavilion. This person had kept a low profile, and he hadn’t said anything since the beginning. He circulated his mental energy when he spoke and calmed Zhang Yu down.

This made Ji Lingfeng let out a breath of relief before he said, “Thank you, Brother Lin.”

Zhang Yu was a little too obsessed with his loss. If he couldn’t calm himself down in time, it might become a demon planted in his heart, which would be troublesome. But Lin Qingyang had calmed Zhang Yu down and saved him from that.

Lin Qingyang merely nodded his head, but didn’t say anything else.

Lin Yun won three battles, and all of his opponents were strong, especially Zhang Yu. The other party was someone ranked in the top fifty on the Dragon Pulse Ranking, and his talent was outstanding, even in the entire Eastern Desolation.

“He’s still not coming down? What is he trying to do?”

“Don’t tell me he wants to challenge the top ten. That’s a little too arrogant…”

“He’s too bloated because of his victory. Anyone in the top ten can easily crush him, and that is no longer due to a gap in their cultivation.” Seeing that Lin Yun had no intentions of coming down the stage, many people were a little furious.

Lin Yun was already famous for becoming first at the Nirvana Banquet. He already became the center of attention in the three previous fights, but it was a little too disrespectful to the Martial Dao Tea Party to keep fighting. This was the same as looking down on everyone.

Lin Yun didn’t leave the stage because he intended to challenge the top ten to gauge his current strength. Aside from that, he also sensed a powerful fighting spirit, and this came from the youngest of the top ten, the Myriad Lightning Sect’s Yi Feng.

Yi Feng was a genius who rose to fame over the last two years. He was only in his twenties, and his fame was as high as Ji Lingfeng. After Lin Yun defeated Zhang Yu, he displayed a strong fighting spirit, but his senior brother ultimately stopped him.

His senior brother was calm because Yi Feng was here to become first on the Dragon Pulse Ranking, and he did not need to expose his strength against Lin Yun. Fighting Lin Yun would also lower Yi Feng’s status.

This made Lin Yun slightly disappointed. Just when he wondered if he should take the initiative to challenge the Wind Edge Lord, a terrifying chill suddenly swept out across the Thunderblood Battlestage.

A black shadow silently descended from the sky. This person was dressed in black with a longsword in his right hand and was emitting a powerful sword aura that was visible to the naked eye. Anyone looking at him could feel a chill running down their spine.

“You want to challenge the top ten after defeating Zhang Yu? Lin Xiao, aren’t you being too disrespectful to us? Do you think the Martial Dao Tea Party is the Nirvana Banquet?” This person looked at Lin Yun with a hint of fury in his tone.

This person was Yan Tie, from a sect that mainly practiced the sword and was one of the three swordsmen on the Dragon Pulse Ranking. The other two swordsmen were the Wind Swordsman and Cloud Swordsman. Together, they were known as the strongest existences beneath the top ten of the Dragon Pulse Ranking.

Many people could tell that these three had the strength to challenge those in the top ten and had a high chance of success. He was ranked seventeenth on the Dragon Pulse Ranking and a few years older than Zhang Yu. His strength was also much stronger.

“The Azure Dragon Intent is ultimately a variant of the Wind Intent. We’re both swordsmen, so you have no secrets before me.” Yan Tie said in contempt, looking at Lin Yun.

Lin Yun might seem unfathomable to others, but that wasn’t the case for Yan Tie. Swordsmen had always been like this, and there was nothing unusual in fighting enemies with higher cultivation than them.
