Chapter 777 - Flute, Same As Before!

Lin Yun instantly recalled how Yue Weiwei’s flute music helped his comprehension in the past.

“A flute?” Situ Feihu was surprised before he smiled, “It’s rare to find experts in flute music in the Ancient Southern Domain. But it’s a pity that I have a senior in my family who’s an expert. Your flute music is useless against me.”

“Please listen then,” smiled Yue Weiwei as she raised her flute, revealing her fair hands from her red dress that left many people dazed.

“Sorry, but I won’t give you the chance.” Situ Feihu smiled cunningly as he noticed something unusual about Yue Weiwei a long time ago. Yue Weiwei’s appearance was breathtaking, so it would be troublesome if she combined it with her flute music.

The best way to deal with a genius who used music was to stop them from playing music. Gently tapping his interspatial pouch, Situ Feihu took out a silver spear that was shrouded in cold wind. As the wind revolved, it continued to accumulate into a powerful aura.

The spear might be terrifying, but Situ Feihu was even more terrifying than the spear. Before Yue Weiwei placed the flute on her lips, Situ Feihu disappeared with his spear. When he reappeared, he swung his spear at Yue Weiwei.

Before Situ Feihu’s spear hit Yu Weiwei, her flute music rang out. Yue Weiwei wasn’t disrupted by Situ Feihu’s sudden movements as she closed her eyes with a smile. When she closed her eyes, her charm transformed from a blooming peony to a snow white lotus.

As the ethereal flute music echoed out, the Nine Dragon Lake began to light up. When the lightning radiated Yue Weiwei’s face, it lit up her flawless features. At this moment, she was terrifying. As her music rang out, Yue Weiwei’s hair began to flutter like a waterfall as Situ Feihu was sent flying backwards with his spear.

“You lost.” Lin Yun knew that Situ Feihu would lose the fight. None of the spectators were bothered by the outcome either as they were intoxicated by Yue Weiwei’s music.

The flute music was filled with many emotions like happiness, bitterness, and sorrow. When the emotion in the music was low, everyone felt like they were going insane from their suppressed feelings. When the emotion in the flute music was high, everyone’s blood began to boil.

As the music continued, the final note suddenly exploded and eighteen water geysers shot up from the lake. Once this happened, Yue Weiwei opened her eyes. In that split second, her face was filled with endless prestige.

Situ Feihu raised his head when the music stopped and he locked eyes with Yue Weiwei. Then, he was sent flying as he vomited blood. Dropping to one knee, Situ Feihu’s face was drained of all colors. Yue Wewei smiled at this sight and the water geysers around the stage became gentle.

“It looks like someone as beautiful as me is still pretty useful. Isn’t that right, Young Master Situ?” Yue Weiwei lowered her flute as the sleeve of her dress covered her arm.

“You witch!” Situ Feihu flew into range and charged towards Yue Weiwei.

But Yue Weiwei easily sent him flying with a palm and smiled, “I might be beautiful, but I’m not someone the likes of you can touch.”

Just like that, Situ Feihu fell onto the edge of the lake and fainted.

“Did he really lose like that?” The spectators were dumbfounded as if they didn’t realize that they were listening to a long song. When they woke up from their stupor, they realized that Situ Feihu was defeated.

“How terrifying, another top-tier genius lost.”

“It’s not a surprise with this Draconic Banquet.”

“Who is this girl? She’s so mysterious!” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“I don’t know. I’ve never heard of her. The Heavenly Demon Pavilion have really hidden themselves deeply.” Everyone was already numb to seeing the top-tier geniuses get defeated. All this battle did was make the crowd more curious about Yue Weiwei.

From the Heavenly Demon Pavilion’s seat, Yan Long’zi smiled as his eyes radiated with greed for Yue Weiwei. At this moment, he decided that he had to subdue this woman in the future.

“Yue Weiwei wins!” As the judge announced the result, Yue Weiwei soared into the sky and landed beside Lin Yun. She winked at him before she left with a smile.

“Oh my god, she smiled at me!”

“What are you saying? She clearly smiled at me. I can feel my heart melting.”

“Get lost, she smiled at me! Look in the mirror. How can Yue Weiwei smile at someone like you?” Yue Weiwei’s smile instantly caused a huge commotion among the spectators. Some of them even fought among themselves.

Qin Yang’s face was terrifyingly dark because he saw that Yue Weiwei smiled after she looked at Lin Yun. At this moment, his chest was filled with rage at Lin Yun’s fortune. Not only was he humiliated in the Sword Firmament Pavilion, but he was receiving blow after blow from Lin Yun in Dragoncloud City.

This was too much and he wished to fight Lin Yun immediately in order to crush him completely.

Pavilion Master Plum looked at Lin Yun weirdly and asked, “Lin Yun, are you familiar with her?”

Lin Yun was briefly stunned when he heard that. The two of them had experienced life and death together. They had an ambiguous relationship and he considered her to be a friend, but it wasn’t like Lin Yun was able to see through Yue Weiwei. Sometimes, Lin Yun would even think that he would be terribly fooled if he treated her words seriously. A brief moment later, Lin Yun smiled bitterly, “I guess.”

Pavilion Master Plum smiled, “We can talk about it later. The first round will come to an end soon and you should try to get as much profound amber aura as you can.”

Based on Lin Yun’s performance, it was practically certain that he would make it into the second round. The only thing that was uncertain was if Lin Yun could maintain his perfect record. If it was before the Draconic Banquet, Pavilion Master Plum naturally wouldn’t dare to say those words. But after witnessing Lin Yun’s performance, Pavilion Master Plum had more confidence in Lin Yun.

After all, Lin Yun defeating Yan Luoyu with a single sword was too impactful. The first round continued and everyone who ran into Lin Yun would immediately admit defeat. None of them wanted to take the risk. As for Lin Yun’s friends, their situations were all very different.

Ji Wuye could make it into the second round, but his winning streak came to an end when he ran into the top-tier genius ranked number fifteen. As for Yang Fan, he still had hopes of making it through the first round, but he had already lost several rounds.

Even Fang Hanluo, who Lin Yun paid attention to, made a breakthrough in battle. After losing to Yang Fan, Fang Hanluo no longer lost as his cultivation was now in the pinnacle Yin-Yang stage. He was a genius, so many people paid attention to him.

There were other geniuses that made breakthroughs in the banquet, but only Fang Hanluo’s strength continued to increase. In fact, the speed of his improvement was a little terrifying. Lin Yun felt that if Yang Fan ran into him again, it wouldn’t be clear if he could defeat Fang Hanluo.

There’s something weird. He should already be able to make a breakthrough, but he purposely used the battles to temper himself. Lin Yun started examining Fang Hanluo. If this was really the case, then Fang Hanluo was terrifying. This meant that Fang Hanluo had planned this from the start since he was confident in his own strength.

After all, if he ran into a top-tier genius right at the start, he would be heavily injured or even crippled before he could unleash his potential.

Wait… Lin Yun was suddenly shocked because he realized that Fang Hanluo might want to encounter a top-tier genius instead. After all, if he ran into a powerful opponent, he would be able to unleash more of his potential.

Lin Yun watched Fang Hanluo’s battle more intently. Fang Hanluo heavily injured his opponent in less than ten moves and won beautifully, but there was disappointment in his eyes. He turned his gaze towards the top-tier geniuses and even the three kings and seven elites before he left.

At this moment, Lin Yun was certain that Fang Hanluo wasn’t afraid of running into strong opponents. On the contrary, he wanted to face strong opponents, which included the three kings and seven elites. At this moment, Lin Yun became more interested in the Draconic Banquet.

“Tenth battle, Lin Yun VS Qin Yang!” The judge announced, which left Lin Yun and Qin Yang briefly stunned. At this moment, a commotion broke out as everyone recalled their face off back on the city wall.
