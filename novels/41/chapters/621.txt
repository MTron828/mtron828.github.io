Chapter 622 - Primal Origin, Praise the Phoenix!

When the sword array appeared, the crimson net began to emit a cracking sound as it could no longer shrink. When the ninety-four silver swords danced around Lin Yun, silver waves began to ripple out as the flames burning on the net also began to die.

This scene left those outside the Withernorth Sea shocked as they watched Lin Yun’s aura rise. No one could have imagined that Lin Yun would be able to turn the tables around. Furthermore, they could sense that Lin Yun’s aura was constantly rising under the array. Although this aura couldn’t be compared to Ji Wuye’s cultivation, it had narrowed the gap by a great deal.

Everyone was curious as to what Lin Yun would do with the sudden increase in strength. Was this a declaration that the battle wasn’t over?

“Sword array?” Many sect’s elders were surprised to look at the array around Lin Yun. “Just what is Lin Yun’s origin to create a sword array by himself? Not only that, but the aura coming from the sword array is extremely ancient…”

When swords formed an array, even the most ordinary one could amplify someone’s power by several times. Powerful sword arrays have always been some sword sects’ trump cards. But it was unheard of that someone could bring out a sword array by himself.

Many elders who saw this scene had opened their eyes wide, “Bringing out a sword array by himself. This is the first time I’ve seen such a thing.”

Another elder also spoke out, “Lin Yun has temporarily stabilized the situation with the array.” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“He really has a lot of trump cards,” said Xie Yunqiao with a sigh.

“Don’t worry about it. This is only temporary. The blood net isn’t destroyed, not to mention that Lin Yun is still in the domain even if he breaks the net. It’s only a matter of time before he is defeated.”

“No matter what, he can’t have the empyrean’s Astral Pearl…” Qin An, Pei Yue, and Yan Kong looked nervous despite what they said. No matter how they looked at it right now, Lin Yun had managed to stabilize the situation. This meant that Ji Wuye had lost his crushing momentum.

The Iris Sword Array had caused a huge commotion outside the Withernorth Sea and those from the Heavenly Province academy all had joy on their faces.

Mo Ling’s eyes flashed as she looked at Lin Yun. After all, he had shocked her too many times. He had undergone a huge transformation compared to when he first entered the academy. Since Lin Yun was a dragon, his reputation would increase after this battle.

On the other hand, Zhang Yuan’s face became awkward as he became nervous again.

Ji Wuye looked at the swords revolving around Lin Yun as he said in a stiffened and cold voice, “You’re...really troublesome.”

Holding onto the Flower Burial Sword, Lin Yun could sense the surging origin energy within his body. The Iris Sword Array had become one with him and the power he could control right now frightened him. With a breakthrough in the Iris Sword Sutra, the power of the array had become more powerful.

“That’s why I told you to get serious. Otherwise, you’ll lose terribly,” said Lin Yun as he raised his head.

“What arrogance. Don’t forget that you’re still in my blood net!” Ji Wuye’s eyes flashed as he opened a cut on his palm. As his blood flowed into his sword, his face turned pale and his body trembled. But at the same time, a crimson sword ray soared into the sky that formed into crimson clouds that tumbled violently in the sky as if something terrifying was going to make its appearance.

“This fellow is really possessed…” Lin Yun frowned his eyebrows when he saw this scene. Ji Wuye’s means had already exceeded the scope of swordsmanship. More accurately speaking, he could no longer be called a swordsman as he had gone onto a path of no return in bloodlust.

He could sense a terrifying bloodlust brewing in the crimson clouds that even caused the sword array around him to tremble.

Right at this moment, Ji Wuye barked, “Bloodfernal Executioner Stage!”

At this moment, the feeling coming from Ji Wuye was terrifying. He was like an executioner from hell that harvested lives without any trace of humanity. As the crimson clouds rolled, an execution stage with nine chains that were embedded with hundreds of skeletons had appeared.

“You’re the first person who has forced me to use this move ever since I comprehended it,” said Ji Wuye with a sinister expression as he slashed his sword down. At the same time, the chains on the executioner stage began to wriggle as the entire stage descended towards Lin Yun.

When the stage came crashing down, fine cracks appeared in space. Everyone could tell that Ji Wuye’s current strength wasn’t any inferior to the initial Yin-Yang stage right now. It looked like he desperately wanted to kill Lin Yun with this attack.

Lin Yun raised his head to look at the stage without any fear on his face, albeit he felt the danger coming from it. With a single thought, the silver swords around him all froze as Lin Yun’s body jolted from the pain he felt within his body.

In the next second, a sword buzz began to echo out as the ninety-four swords moved slowly by an inch. It was only an inch, but a torrential sword intent exploded out as Lin Yun’s sword intent began to accumulate at a terrifying speed. When the array made an entire reverse circulation, it formed a silver pillar that pierced through the clouds.

In the next second, the blood net shattered into pieces as the entire lake began to tremble. At the same time, the sword array that was only a hundred feet expanded to two hundred feet, and the swords had increased by a fold, reaching a shocking amount of a hundred and eighty-eight.

But that wasn’t all because Lin Yun was still circulating the array. Even after seven circulations, the array showed no signs of stopping. Lin Yun’s forehead was covered in sweat and his face turned pale from this.

Ji Wuye’s attack was too terrifying, so Lin Yun couldn’t be sure that the sword array at eight circulations could block this attack.

On the other side, Ji Wuye’s face had also turned ugly. His body was trembling as his face became paler with every second the stage descended. But he still gritted his teeth and gave it his all.

Looking at Ji Wuye and the descending stage, Lin Yun knew that Ji Wuye was betting it all onto this attack.

“Who’s afraid of who?!” Lin Yun roared as a torrential sword buzz echoed from his body and the sword array completed nine circulations. Then, the size of the array expanded to a thousand feet.

Right at this moment, Lin Yun’s origin energy had reached an unbelievable height as the image of an ice phoenix could be vaguely seen descending from the sky. Everyone wondered if their eyes were fooling with them when a brilliant phoenix cry echoed out.

The cry was filled with the pride of a phoenix that caused the starry sky to turn dim. Lin Yun’s eyes flashed as he slashed his sword out at the descending stage.

Iris Sword Array—Absolute Unrivaled; Primal Origin, Praise the Phoenix!

When the phoenix cry was heard, a sun started to rise behind Lin Yun as the crimson domain suddenly shattered. When light from the starry sky descended once more, it made the sun look even more brilliant.

Lin Yun’s sword had shattered space as it clashed with the sinister-looking stage under countless shocked gazes.
