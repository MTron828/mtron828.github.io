Chapter 2382 - Old And Cunning

The Profound Sky Venerable was shocked when he saw the dragon’s claw that stretched out from space. The carving was bloody, as though the dragon’s claw was carving directly into Lin Yun’s soul. The pain also made Lin Yun’s face sinister while he was down on one knee.

“Profound Sky Venerable, what’s going on?” Even Lin Jiangxian couldn’t help turning to look at Profound Sky Venerable. Everyone else also became nervous, while Profound Sky Venerable looked like he already had an answer.

Profound Sky Venerable said, “Wanting to refine a Divine Sovereign Dragon Pellet isn’t easy and requires the recognition from the Azure Dragon Constellation. Usually, only an Ancestral Stage expert could refine it. But if one could refine it, it would bestow the blessing of an Eternal Sovereign Constellation, as well as the benefits of the pellet.”

Everyone finally knew what was going on upon hearing that. They naturally knew four Eternal Sovereign Constellations: Azure Dragon, Vermilion Bird, White Tiger, and Black Tortoise.

“Generally speaking, the Azure Dragon Constellation would only open one eye to take a look before bestowing benefits, and it would only be a Divine Dragon Baptism, at best. But using the dragon’s claw to bestow cultivation or bloodline is the highest possible treatment...” The Profound Sky Venerable said in a trembling tone. He continued, “It is scarce, and I've only heard about engraving the Divine Dragon Sovereign Seal from legends. This is the same as bestowing nobility. This also means that Lin Yun has surpassed everyone, whether in regards to Azure Dragon Dao or Dragon Clan’s body-refining technique. This is the same as receiving the Sovereign Constellation’s acknowledgment, and he could use the power of an Eternal Sovereign Constellation anytime.”

When Profound Sky Venerable finished speaking, the engraving of the Divine Dragon Sovereign Seal was also completed and a golden seal appeared on Lin Yun’s forehead. In the next second, Lin Yun gave off a powerful dragon aura that made him look like a deity.

“This is unbelievable. I thought the Divine Dragon Sovereign Physique was heaven-defying enough... but he managed to obtain the Divine Dragon Sovereign Seal...” Profound Sky Venerable muttered. The Divine Sovereign Dragon Pellet might be rare, but there were at least a hundred people who had obtained them over the past thousand to three thousand years. But no one could reach Lin Yun’s height.

“You guys don’t disturb him, but watch from afar. I’ll seal off the news,” Profound Sky Venerable said as he saw several people coming over.

There were only seven days left till a month had passed, and there were still many people in Heavenly Barren City. The colossal commotion naturally alarmed them into thinking that a treasure had appeared.

But Profound Sky Venerable released his aura as an Emperor and shifted those people away. When those people landed on the ground, they could hear Profound Sky Venerable’s voice in their ears, “No one is allowed to enter. Those who enter will die!” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Everyone was afraid upon hearing that but had no idea what was happening.

When the dragon’s claw disappeared, Lin Yun regained control over his body, and he heaved a sigh in relief when he landed on the ground. He touched his forehead, and the Divine Dragon Sovereign Seal disappeared. He could still sense the existence of the seal, since it was engraved on his skull and soul. When he was in tremendous pain earlier, a massive amount of information was being crammed into his mind, and it was all about the Divine Dragon Sovereign Seal.

“I see...” Lin Yun looked at the closed sky and remembered many things. He recalled his fight on the Heavenly Path, where he also saw a dragon in the sky and a pair of dragon’s eyes. There were also his encounters in the Azure Dragon Palace and receiving an inheritance from the Azure Dragon Lord.

Ji Zixi only knew that Lin Yun possessed the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella, but she didn’t know that he had long inherited the Azure Dragon Lord’s title. Because of his existence on the Heavenly Path, it was already destined that he would receive the Divine Dragon Sovereign Seal and the Divine Sovereign Dragon Pellet was only meant to speed up the process.

Seeing Ji Zixi and everyone else in the surroundings, Lin Yun smiled, “You guys can come over now. I’m fine.”

He had long sensed their existences, and he knew that they must have been worried about him. But he couldn’t deliver any information to them earlier.

“Congratulations!” Everyone wore a smile when they came over to Lin Yun, and they congratulated his harvest.

Lin Yun thought of something, and looked at Xiong Tiannan, “I remembered that you’re a body-refining cultivator?”

“Well, yeah.” Xiong Tiannan smiled. It was more challenging for a body-refining cultivator to become a Saint than others because it required a powerful will, and Xiong Tiannan was rather proud of it.

“Since that’s the case, why don’t we have a spar?” Lin Yun’s eyes lit up since he could also be considered a body-refining cultivator now.

But the moment he said that, Xiong Tiannan’s face became stiff, and he awkwardly said, “Big Brother, I’m just joking about it. I practice the Ghost Dao, so you don’t have to treat it seriously.”

“You’re afraid,” Ao Jue smiled.

“It’s fine. Let’s have a spar,” Lin Yun said. Now that he had formed the Divine Dragon Sovereign Physique, he needed to get used to it, and these people were the most suitable. Even if they weren’t willing, he could force them.

Xiong Tiannan bitterly smiled, “I really can’t.”

Lin Yun’s tribulation even made his scalp numb, and he had no other thoughts aside from fear. Now that Lin Yun possessed the Divine Dragon Sovereign Physique and the Divine Dragon Sovereign Seal, he had the complete Divine Dragon Sovereign Physique.

“Allow me,” Profound Sky Venerable said.

“Good idea!” Xiong Tiannan said.

“He’s not lying. His lineage practices the Ghost Dao, so you’ll only kill him if you fight,” Profound Sky Venerable said.

“Well... it’s inappropriate for me to fight you, right?” Lin Yun awkwardly smiled. This time, it was Lin Yun who wore a bitter expression. Profound Sky Venerable was an Emperor, so there was no way he could put up a fight even if the Divine Dragon Sovereign Physique was powerful.

“Don’t worry about it. I will reduce my cultivation to a first-stage Saint Lord, so you guys can retreat first.” Profound Sky Venerable waved his hand and looked at Lin Yun with interest. He continued, “You might only be a seventh-stage Saint Lord, but you can even suppress a ninth-stage Saint Lord. I’ll only be a first-stage Saint Lord, and I won’t take advantage of you.”

A first-stage Saint Lord?

To an Emperor, it was different even if they restricted their cultivation to a first-stage Saint Lord. It was like how Lin Yun defeated all Samsara Edict Realm experts, even if he reduced his cultivation to the Dragon Pulse Realm.

Even so, Lin Yun awkwardly smiled, “Are you looking down on me too much?”

“Looking down on you?” Profound Sky Venerable smiled, “It’s fine for youngsters to be a little arrogant, but you should show respect to an Emperor. Even if I restrict my cultivation to a Saint Lord, I’m already bullying you.”

Outside the ruins, Lin Jiangxian said, “Profound Sky Venerable might have a huge fall.”

“How is that possible? Even if an Emperor restricts their cultivation, it doesn’t affect the strength of experts like them. I have been beaten since I was young, so I can say that,” Xiong Tiannan said with shock.

Lin Jiangxian merely smiled and said nothing.

In the ruins, Profound Sky Venerable asked, “Don’t say I’m looking down on you. I will only defend and not attack. If you can make me step back, consider it my loss.”

Lin Yun raised his brow upon hearing that, and smiled, “Why don’t we make a bet? If I win...”

But before he finished, Profound Sky Venerable laughed and looked at him playfully, “Don’t just mention that you win. What if you lost? If you lose, you will stay behind in Heaven’s Gate for a hundred years. If you dare to take that bet, I will bet with you.”

He had a strong stance, so he didn’t bother concealing his objectives.

“Sure,” Lin Yun said without any hesitation.

“Come, let me see how powerful the Divine Dragon Sovereign Physique is!” Profound Sky Venerable laughed with excitement flashing in his eyes. After all, how long has it been since someone achieved the Divine Dragon Sovereign Physique? Not to mention that Lin Yun even possessed the Divine Dragon Sovereign Seal and could use the power of an Eternal Sovereign Constellation!

He was confident in his strength, and Lin Yun was only a seventh-stage Saint Lord. Even if the Divine Dragon Sovereign Physique was powerful, he wanted to teach Lin Yun a lesson to strike a blow in his confidence. The moment he finished speaking, he laughed as he began to form seals.

As the light shone on Profound Sky Venerable, light began to pour into his body, and it soon formed into a golden armor on his body.

“This is the Heavenly Metal Divine Physique, and I will only use a hundred different Metal Saint Daos, restricting my cultivation as a first-stage Saint Lord. But in terms of the physique, my physique can be comparable to a Threespirit Glory Saint Artifact.” Profound Sky Venerable gave off a powerful aura. He then smiled, “This is under the condition that I don’t use my body-refining technique, or I will become even more powerful.”

Lin Jiangxian’s face became grave. She had to admit that the Heavenly Metal Divine Physique was powerful. It was equivalent to cheating for an Emperor to use it against a junior, since it was impossible to lose.

“He’s old and cunning,” Xiong Tiannan sighed.

“He’s too bad!” Ji Zixi frowned unhappily.

Profound Sky Venerable wasn’t furious, but smiled instead, “What do you mean old and cunning? You guys should learn!”

Lin Yun frowned as he wore a grave expression. The light on Profound Sky Venerable’s body was equivalent to the Golden-Eyed Demonspirit’s demonic runes.

“Don’t bother looking. Even if you look for a hundred years, you can’t find the weakness of my divine physique,” Profound Sky Venerable smiled. “The Heavenly Metal Armor consists of over ten thousand combinations, and there aren’t any weaknesses. Even if there are weaknesses, they will only be traps.”

Lin Yun flung his lips to the side because this old man was really arrogant.
