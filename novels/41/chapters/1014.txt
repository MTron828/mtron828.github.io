Chapter 1015 - Elysium Trigram, Nether Divinity, and Profound Dragon!

With their foundation from a war realm, Mo Xuan and Han Lei naturally had dao armor on them. Dao armor was a lot more precious than weapons because they were rare and could protect one’s life. After all, life was usually more precious than anything else. Opportunities and fortune could be found, but there was only one life.

But Lin Yun’s attack was too terrifying. Not only did he manage to tear apart the origin energy around Mo Xuan, but he even managed to destroy Mo Xuan’s dao armor. Mo Xuan’s origin energy came from an ancient fortune cultivation technique. Plus, his aura oceans were empowered by lightning runes that gave him the advantage to suppress opponents in the same cultivation.

However, none of that mattered to Lin Yun. Mo Xuan’s hair was scattered as he struggled to get back on his feet. Unable to get up, he fell to the ground while blood flowed from his mouth. He wasn’t sure what was more painful, Lin Yun’s attack or being humiliated in front of the watchful eyes of the crowd.

The outcome had surprised everyone because no one expected Han Lai and Mo Xuan to fail. Although everyone had heard about Lin Yun’s fame and the fact that he was called the Flower Burial Sword Demon, no one had thought he had a chance against the war realms.

When the crowd looked at Lin Yun again, their gazes became complicated. There were less than three months until the final battle. They might not be able to make it far, but perhaps this young swordsman would create a legend in the final battle. He might even break the monopoly that the Ten War Realms had on the top rankings. Furthermore, Lin Yun’s appearance proved that even someone from a lower realm could reach the height of the Ten War Realms.

Suddenly, a violent wind blew from afar that caused the ground to tremble violently. It instantly drew everyone’s attention. Lin Yun wasn’t surprised by it because he could sense several powerful auras approaching while he was fighting Han Lei and Mo Xuan. “They’re here?” blurted Lin Yun.

There was more than one person whose aura made Lin Yun feel threatened. He speculated that they were the strongest among those from the Ten War Realms. Since he knew that this wasn’t the proper time to face them, Lin Yun grabbed Pei Xue and yelled, “Let’s go!” He ran before Pei Xue could push him away.

“The young masters are here!” Just when Han Lei intended to back off, his facial expression turned into joy. With the young masters present, there was no way Lin Yun could maintain his arrogance.

“Stay behind!” Han Lei wanted to hold Lin Yun back until the young masters came, but a dark golden staff sent him flying. This attack naturally came from Lil’ Red who had been watching in the dark. It was such a terrifying attack that heavily injured Han Lei. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

When Han Lei recovered from the attack, he saw Lil’ Red grinning at him. It was Lin Yun’s infamous pet that stole treasures. Lil’ Red was also known for being as strong as Lin Yun. There were rumors that Lil’ Red even had the bloodline of a genuine dragon and cultivated the saint martial technique of the demon clan. On top of all that, Lil’ Red possessed many treasures. “This damn cat!”

As lightning flashed on the horizon, three blurred figures appeared. When Luo Chen’s group saw the newcomers, their faces changed. “The Realm Sons!”

The Realm Sons were the young masters that Mo Xuan and Han Lei talked about. They had positions equivalent to leaders of the higher realms, but their war realms weren’t like the other realms. The Ten War Realms existed in the form of clans, and the Realm Sons were those with the strongest talent in the clan. They enjoyed the resources and inheritance of an entire realm.

It would be a similar situation to Lin Yun enjoying all the resources in the Profound Amber Realm. In the war realms, everyone belonged to a clan that reigned supreme while the others were servants. So in this way, there was no way that the Profound Amber Realm’s foundation could be compared to the Ten War Realms.

The Realms Sons emitted a terrifying aura with flowers that underwent the cycle of life and death. It was the first time many people had seen a Realm Son, so they were shocked by the aura.

“What’s going on? Why do those flowers look a little familiar?”

“Demonic Astral Flowers! So the legend is true!”

“There are legends that if one had enough foundation in the Heavenly Soul Realm, a Demonic Astral Flower would descend during the fifth tribulation. If one could subdue the flower, they could boost the strength of their aura oceans.

“So they’re the legendary Realm Sons…?” Because of the arrival of those three, the entire Yellow Sandy Plain went into an uproar. After all, it was hard to see one, let alone three.

When the Realm Sons heard that Pei Xue was here, they pushed their speed to the limit to rush over. But when they arrived and saw Mo Xuan and Han Lei’s injuries, killing intent began to leak from out of their eyes.

“Quick, run!” Everyone else's face turned pale upon sensing the aura. But they didn’t dare to run far because one of the Realm Sons gave them a warning with their eyes.

“Who injured you two? That woman?!” A cold voice came from one of the Realm Sons.

“It was Lin Yun!” Mo Xuan who was kneeling on the ground didn’t dare to raise his head while Han Lei explained what happened with a trembling voice.

“Trash!” When the Realm Son heard what happened, he flew into a rage that caused the entire sky to tremble violently. Simultaneously, he left the tens of thousands of people in the crowd feeling scared.

“We’re guilty!” Han Lei and Mo Xuan’s faces turned pale and didn’t dare to stand up.

Not far away, Luo Chen managed to recognize the identities of the Realm Sons. He began to wonder what treasure Pei Xue had to make the Realm Sons join hands. After all, one was enough to destroy everyone in the Heavenly Path. Furthermore, Luo Chen knew that they didn’t even have to make a move to make the higher realms bow.

After all, the foundation of the Ten War Realms was terrifying and an opportunity from them was greater than an ordinary inheritance from the Heavenly Path. Luo Chen had the opportunity to bow to them and gain an opportunity, but he chose not to. He preferred his freedom and didn’t want to limit himself.

Instantly knowing that Lin Yun was in deep trouble by helping Pei Xue, Luo Chen began to feel worried. He had warned Lin Yun not to make a move and provoke the war realms, but Lin Yun had to go and offend three war realms.

Then again, if Lin Yun wasn’t so stubborn, he also wouldn’t have such a firm will that helped him achieve a high attainment in the sword path. However, not many people could do what Lin Yun did in the Heavenly Path, including Luo Chen.

“Big brother, what’s that?” Qin Lin whispered as he saw the Elysium Trigram Realm Son take out a mirror.

When Luo Chen squinted his eyes over, he exclaimed, “The Time-Turning Mirror!”

It was a treasure that could allow someone to turn back time. Then again, there was a huge restriction because there had to be a powerful energy fluctuation to turn back time or else it would end in failure. When the Time-Turning Mirror was activated, blurred images began to start flashing. Only the scene of Lin Yun bringing out his sky sword intent to destroy Mo Xuan and Han Lei’s combined attack was perfectly replayed.

“What’s this?!” The Elysium Trigram Realm Son’s face changed when he saw Lin Yun block Mo Xuan and Han Lei’s attacks with the Azure Dragon Saint Armor. When the three Realm Sons looked at Lin Yun’s heart, they could see a bone engraved with a complete divine rune.

“The Azure Dragon True Bone!” At this moment, they knew how Lin Yun managed to defeat Mo Xuan and Han Lei. Their gazes became heated because they never expected that the opportunity in the Azure Dragon Palace would be an Azure Dragon True Bone.

“We can’t keep him around!” yelled the Elysium Trigram Realm Son.
