Chapter 2060 - Sky Incineration Flames (2)

Zhao Wuji had an inheritance, but Lin Yun didn’t have one. Even so, he naturally had his resilience.

“Polar Opposite!” Lin Yun leaped from the winged dragon statue with his sword breaking through the shackles of space, crossing hundreds of meters in a split second.

When the moon was shattered, Lin Yun turned around and swung his sword down. It looked like he was a cliff in the sky with a vast sea behind him. As he swung his sword, the forcibly compressed space exploded with ten times the power.

“The second section of the Divine Firefly Sword! How many swords has Ye Qingtian grasped?!” The audience exclaimed. They weren’t too bothered when they initially saw Ye Qingtian execute the two swords. But when they saw him executing the third sword, the Sword Alliance’s disciples couldn’t help becoming shocked.

Zhao Wuji’s attack was interrupted before the moon rose to the sky and the black lotus bloomed.

“Flaming Floral Silver Tree!” Lin Yun began to unleash his counterattacks. As Lin Yun merged with a flaming tree, he held onto the Flower Burial Sword and stepped forth, leaving behind thousands of afterimages. As silver flowers bloomed on the tree, the afterimages and sword rays bloomed simultaneously.

This was a beautiful scene on the lake. Densely packed sword rays formed into a powerful whirlwind of sword aura as the afterimages intertwined. When sparks crackled and trapped Zhao Wuji within, there was nothing Zhao Wuji could do to break free, no matter how he tried.

Zhao Wuji’s face sank. He had no choice but to summon his constellation. His constellation was a black lotus with a black-clothed monk seated on the lotus. This monk had crimson eyes and looked like an ancient fiendgod.

“Black Lotus Annihilation!” After Zhao Wuji shattered the phenomenon created by Lin Yun, he unleashed his ultimate move. The Black Plume Sword Art had thirteen sword forms and the strongest attack that he had grasped.

“Not enough.” Lin Yun shook his wrist and gathered the silver flowers over. When Lin Yun swung the Flower Burial Sword around, the silver flowers formed a silver dragon that coiled around him before charging over.

When the two phenomena clashed, Lin Yun and Zhao Wuji brushed past each other with their swords, producing a loud metallic collision. Many people couldn’t even see the trajectory of Lin Yun and Zhao Wuji’s movements; they could only see the intense collision between the phenomena created by them.

As the lake rumbled, water geysers began to rise from the lake. When a sound like a Buddha’s roar echoed, everyone’s hearts sank because the confrontation between Lin Yun and Zhao Wuji was evenly matched.

This caused a series of exclamations from the surrounding.

“Holy shit, aren’t the two of them too powerful? Based on the power that they’ve displayed, I’m afraid their attacks aren’t something someone at the Nirvana Stage could withstand.”

“I bet only someone at the Quasi-Saint Realm can suppress them.”

“I don’t share the same thought. They both rumored to have killed Quasi-Saints. Whether it is Zhao Wuji or Ye Qingtian, they would become overlords in this world in the future.”

“They both possess the potential to become sword saints!” Everyone already forgot about their grievances for Ye Qingtian and were fully immersed in this terrifying confrontation.

If this wasn’t the Sword Assembly, they would probably be unable to watch a confrontation of this level for their whole lives.

As sparks flew, Lin Yun and Zhao Wuji separated before they each landed on a statue. Fine cracks appeared on Lin Yun’s palm, with blood dripping down. It was the same for Zhao Wuji, not to mention Zhao Wuji had resorted to summoning his constellation.

If Lin Yun and Zhao Wuji didn’t have a powerful physique during the earlier confrontation, they would have been ripped into pieces.

Zhao Wuji held onto his sword and looked at Ye Qingtian. He knew he had encountered the strongest opponent he had faced by far. But there wasn’t a hint of fear in his eyes. On the contrary, his eyes were blazing with powerful fighting spirits.

“Die!” Zhao Wuji raised his sword before him and swiped his two fingers across the sword.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

As the lake began to surge, spiritual sacred goldwater began oozing out from the lake and gathered around Zhao Wuji. It didn’t take long for the spiritual sacred goldwater to begin spiraling around him like a tornado.

“Extinguish!” Since Zhao Wuji grasped the flame intent, the spiritual sacred goldwater ignited when he spoke out.

This scene shocked everyone from the Sword Alliance. Just a droplet of the spiritual sacred goldwater could kill, but Zhao Wuji controlled tens of thousands, with each droplet was comparable to a saint sword.

When Zhao Wuji swiped his fingers on the sword, blood splashed. Then, Zhao Wuji swung his sword. The ten thousand droplets of spiritual sacred goldwater flew out like torrential rain, enveloping the entire region where Lin Yun was located.

The water droplets looked as though they could even ignite space, and just one droplet was enough to inflict heavy injuries on someone.

Lin Yun took a deep breath before swinging the Flower Burial Sword down. Nine geysers shot out from the lake, with each geyser reaching a hundred feet high, before continuing to climb into the air.

When the torrential rain and geysers clashed, the clash made the surroundings tremble as the scenery around Lin Yun and Zhao Wuji looked like the end of the world. Everyone who watched this could feel their scalps going numb.

“Driving Lightning!” Lin Yun flew over with rumbling thunder echoing in the sky. Lin Yun turned into a streak of light with countless lightning bolts descending from the sky, heading towards the Flower Burial Sword. It didn’t take long for a terrifying sword intent to gather on Lin Yun’s sword.

This shocked Zhao Wuji as he watched Ye Qingtian execute another move of the Divine Firefly Sword’s second section. That was the saint section of the Divine Firefly Sword, and Ye Qingtian had grasped five sword forms, not to mention he was also close to reaching the manifestation stage in each sword form.

Although Zhao Wuji dodged in advance, he was still stabbed by the sword as the black saint robe he wore exploded. There were several hideous wounds on his chest with blood flowing down into the lake. Each wound was so deep that the bones could be seen, even though Zhao Wuji managed to avoid his vital spots.

This was because Lin Yun’s attack contained Astral Sword Intent. So when his Astral Sword Intent penetrated Zhao Wuji’s body, this made Zhao Wuji’s face pale, with him gritting his teeth in pain.

He was lucky that he quickly dodged it, or Ye Qingtian’s sword might’ve split him into two by now.

Lin Yun hovered in the air, looking at Zhao Wuji, not wanting to let him catch his breath after a successful attack. He pointed the Flower Burial Sword to the sky, with the entire sky incinerated with flames. The flames gathered by his sword intent covered the sky with light reflected on Lin Yun’s face.

This was too terrifying because the aura Lin Yun gave off could no longer be described with words. The sheer momentum also caused waves to rise on the ground, and Zhao Wuji couldn’t even stand firmly on the lake due to the waves.

“H-How is this possible?!” Zhao Wuji was dumbfounded as he looked at Ye Qingtian. He was so terrified that his soul trembled because Ye Qingtian was executing another sword form from the Divine Firefly Sword’s second section.

“Sky Incineration Flames!”

“The Sky Incineration Flames?! How is this possible? This is already the sixth sword form!” Everyone on the observation stand stood up and raised their heads to look at Ye Qingtian. At this moment, Ye Qingtian was like a deity hovering in the sky.

“I admit defeat!” Before Lin Yun swung his sword down, Zhao Wuji quickly admitted his defeat. But it was too late because Lin Yun was done accumulating his attack, and he couldn’t pull back, even if he wanted to. So the only thing he could do was swing his sword down in another direction.

As boundless flames gushed out, the massive lake was split into two, with water rising on both sides, before creating waterfalls. Zhao Wuji was sent flying away by the powerful sword aura, but he was like a droplet of rain in a torrential storm, and no one paid any attention to him.

This scene left everyone dumbfounded as they looked at Ye Qingtian with deep shock in their eyes.
