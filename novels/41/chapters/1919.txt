Chapter 1920 - Sword Saint

Lin Yun knew that he had to win the next battle. Although he was confident of making it out of the Loser Group, the process was complicated. After winning, it would be much easier, and he could rest for three days before competing for the top ten.

Many people naturally shared his thoughts, and no one was willing to enter the Loser Group. It would be embarrassing, but the competition would also become intense. They had to fight several rounds in the Loser Group, and it was easy for them to be injured, not to mention their trump cards might be exposed.

Half an incense’s time quickly passed. Half of the people who lost would enter the Loser Group, so the intensity of these battles were much higher. They wouldn’t hold back in their fights and give it their all unless they were confident in their strength.

Ye Feifan and Zhang Yue went on the stage, and their opponents were powerful. Their opponents were older generation saint disciples at the fourth transformation of the Nirvana Stage. But they didn’t hold back their strength and easily defeated their opponents.

The battle between Ye Qingtian and Wang Yue finally arrived. They were both underdogs, and their appearance on the stage instantly drew a lot of cheers. Even some saint disciples turned their attention over, but no one was optimistic about Ye Qingtian, including the Saint Elders and the Dragon Origin Great Saint.

“That brat is a little unlucky. Wang Yue’s cultivation might be lower than Zhang Yue, but Life Intent is something that many saints can’t grasp.” The Dragon Origin Great Saint shook his head.

“That’s right. I can gauge Ye Qingtian’s strength, not to mention Wang Yue’s attainment in the sword, isn’t low, either.”

“But it doesn’t matter. He’s still young and has a lot of room for growth.” The other Saint Elders said.

Right then, an unexpected figure appeared. It was the Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden, Wang Muyan. Her cultivation was at the fourth transformation of the Nirvana Stage, and she also signed up for the Di Group, with many people viewing her as the Di Group’s champion. The likes of Zhang Yue and Ye Feifan were strong, but everyone only felt that they could compete for the top three and not the champion.

“The Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden is here. Did she really take a fancy to Ye Qingtian?”

“Holy shit!”

“Wang Muyan actually chose to observe Ye Qingtian and Wang Yue’s battle…” Everyone had to admit that Wang Muyan was charming. When she appeared, the audiences of the other categories also turned their attention over, including the Tian Group.

Wang Muyan was a voluptuous figure; she was only nineteen this year. Many people couldn’t see her appearance clearly, but her temperament alone was enough to make their hearts pump with hot blood coursing through their bodies.

Lin Yun instantly became alert because he didn’t forget how he suffered a loss because of Wang Muyan.

“Ye Qingtian, what did you do for the holy maiden of my Wang Clan to pay attention to you?” Wang Yue asked in a jealous tone because Wang Muyan’s status within the Wang Clan was much higher than the other holy maidens within the Wang Clan. The patriarch and many elders also doted on her a lot. She was the princess of the Wang Clan.

“There are so many people in love with me. Should I ask every one of them? I’m not that free, and your holy maiden is ordinary in my eyes,” Lin Yun smiled.

“Ha!” Wang Yue became furious. “It doesn’t matter. It’s not like you’re compatible with her, anyways.”

He didn’t waste time with Ye Qingtian and drew his sword, unleashing flames when his sword vibrated. As the flames condensed, they formed into venomous flaming serpents.

Lin Yun looked at Wang Yue in surprise because what the latter showed differed from his previous battle.

“You’re still lacking in a battle between true experts,” Wang Yue smiled. He took a step forth, and his sword thrust towards Lin Yun.

At the same time, the hundreds of flaming serpents came to life under the Life Intent, as if they were alive. Zhang Yue was executing the Heavenly Incineration Sword, one of the strongest sword techniques of the Nether Orchid Courtyard. Pairing it with the Heavenly Incineration Sword Sutra could unleash a terrifying power, making it one of the four most destructive sword techniques beneath the Saint Realm within the Eastern Desolation.Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Heavenly Incineration Sword and Life Intent, Wang Yue is really a genius!”

“He’s only at the first transformation of the Nirvana Stage. When he becomes a Quasi-Saint, he might become invincible at the Quasi-Saint Realm!”

The Heavenly Incineration Sword was famous, and an uproar broke out when Wang Yue executed it. Lin Yun could sense immense pressure, and it looked like he couldn’t underestimate anyone in the Heavenly Dao Sect. Since he couldn’t unleash all his trump cards, it was troublesome for him to face Wang Yue with his sword alone.

Drawing the Flower Burial Sword, Lin Yun stepped back, and Wang Yue’s aura came crushing over the moment he landed on the ground.

“He lost!”

“Facing the Heavenly Incineration Sword, you’ll be defeated if you take a step back.”

“How can you step back, facing the domineering aura of the Heavenly Incineration Sword?” The surrounding disciples judged.

Lin Yun took a deep breath and took another step back. When he took three steps back, over a thousand flaming serpents were on the stage.

Wang Yue snorted and didn’t allow Ye Qingtian to make a move. He knew that the latter’s sword intent was terrifying. So he dashed forth and pricked with the sword.

All the flaming serpents combined under everyone’s gazes, and a dragon aura swept out. If it was someone else, they would lose after facing the pressure of Wang Yue’s sword, even if they had a higher cultivation than him.

But Lin Yun calmly waved his sword, and fireflies appeared within the surrounding area. This instantly made the flaming dragon feel an obstruction.

“Firefly Radiance!” Lin Yun thrust his sword with a dazzling sword ray shining and pushed the flaming dragon back. Even Wang Yue took a few hundred meters back.

“Dawn Radiance!” But Lin Yun didn’t stop there and unleashed the second sword form of the Divine Firefly Sword, tearing the sky apart with a gleam of dawn shining down. The flaming dragon was also beheaded under this attack.

This changed Wang Yue’s face, before he quickly moved to block the incoming attack.

“Sunset Radiance!” Before Wang Yue could resolve this attack, Lin Yun swung his sword down again, and a crimson sun appeared in the sky.

This quickly made Wang Yue take a cold breath, and the flaming dragon burst apart on the ground.

Lin Yun swung three swords on the stage. He was like a descending deity. His sword aura also easily pushed back the aura of Wang Yue’s Heavenly Incineration Sword.

“Waning Moon!” Lin Yun roared, swinging his sword, and a moon appeared in the sky. With a gentle flick of the Flower Burial Sword, the Waning Moon flew out like a sphere.

“That’s the Divine Firefly Sword!”

“Holy shit, how many swords has this been?”

“Is this fellow insane?” The inner disciples were dumbfounded, not knowing what just happened. But all the saint disciples stood up in shock upon seeing that Ye Qingtian grasped the fourth sword form of the Divine Firefly Sword when he was only at the Profound Death Stage. They couldn’t believe that it was real.

But that wasn’t all, as a violet gale appeared around Ye Qingtian with countless snowflakes flying out from his sword. This was the fifth sword form of the Divine Firefly Sword, Heavenly Snowing Mountain!

After this sword, the aura of Wang Yue’s Heavenly Incineration Sword collapsed. The snowflakes enveloped the flames, and Wang Yue was forced to the ground, swinging his sword. Whenever Wang Yue swung his sword, he would step back with his face strained. Wang Yue was completely suppressed by Lin Yun’s sword.

“The fifth sword!” All the Saint Elders on the Heavenly Dao Altar opened their eyes, shining brightly. They were all shocked because every holy land had a copy of the Divine Firefly Sword, but there weren’t more than ten people who could grasp the sixth sword form while at the Profound Death Stage within the Kunlun Realm.

“My Heavenly Dao Sect is going to have another Sword Saint!” A Saint Elder exclaimed.

But that wasn’t all, Lin Yun turned around and swung his sword once more. His hair and clothes fluttered in the wind, and a silver sword ray flew out. This was the sixth sword form of the Divine Firefly Sword, Silver Blood!
