Chapter 544 - Fighting Yang Xiong

Two powerful auras came from Lin Yun and Yang Xiong. Everyone looked at the two of them nervously because they knew that a battle would break out at any moment. At the same time, no one had expected Lin Yun to be so powerful.

Everyone was expecting a one-sided battle, but no one dared to underestimate Lin Yun from the fighting spirit he was giving off. Right at this moment, a ripple spread out on the surface of the lake as Yang Xiong and Lin Yun both moved.

They were enveloped by their own powerful origin energy as they charged at each other. Their collision sent a violent shockwave out, which formed gigantic waves on the lake. They were engaged in a barbaric fight that didn’t utilize any martial techniques. They were clashing with their origin energy, which signified the power of their cultivation techniques.

Yang Xiong and Lin Yun were both confident in their cultivation techniques, but everyone could tell that Yang Xiong held the upper hand in this fight. After all, he had the advantage in his cultivation.

“He’s really confident to clash with Yang Xiong head-on.” Mei Ziyan wore a mocking smile when he saw this scene. The other disciples also nodded their heads silently.

The only exception was Mo Ling, who looked at the battle and wasn’t willing to miss out any detail.

“Is this all you got? I’ve yet to use my full strength!” Yang Xiong sneered as he soared into the sky. “Flower Burial, I’ll be disappointed if this is the best you got!”

Yang Xiong’s eyes flashed coldly and he slammed his palm down. The flame and lightning enveloping him instantly turned into a flaming tornado that devoured Lin Yun. Compared to Yang Xiong, Lin Yun looked so insignificant. However, that wasn’t the end as Yang Xiong started compressing the tornado, bringing the tornado’s lethality to a new level.

His goal wasn’t just to defeat Lin Yun, but to crush Lin Yun completely and humiliate him. He wanted to make Lin Yun beg him for mercy in front of everyone.This way, Lin Yun wouldn’t dare to stand before Liu Yunyan ever again. He wanted to teach Lin Yun the consequences of offending him.

In this Profound Yin Flower competition, only he could be the ultimate winner. This battle would be the start of his rise to the top. Naturally, he had to step on Lin Yun.

The terrifying tornado’s size shrunk by half and Lun Yun seemed so helpless in it. This made many people sigh as they felt that Lin Yun was too arrogant. If he wasn’t so stubborn as to fight Yang Xiong head-on, he wouldn’t be in such a miserable state. Everyone seemed to be able to hear the sounds of Lin Yun’s bones being crushed.

Mei Ziyan sneered as he watched this scene. He was admiring Yang Xiong’s means. After all, it would be too easy if Lin Yun was merely defeated. It was definitely better to see Lin Yun get humiliated thoroughly.

“Hmmm?” Right at this moment, Mei Ziyan noticed something unusual. He could see fine cracks starting to appear on the tornado and he could see sword rays flashing within the tornado.

Sword rays? Just when he was feeling doubtful, the cracks expanded and eighty-one silver sword rays shot out from the tornado. In the next second, the tornado exploded and a majestic sword array appeared before everyone.

Standing within the array, Lin Yun was unharmed. This made Yang Xiong’s face change as his clothes burst apart and he shot towards the sword array.

But even so, Lin Yun stood unfaltered within the sword array as the clothes fragments were torn apart by the sword array.

“He blocked it!” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“How did he manage to do it?” Everyone had shock in their eyes when they saw Lin Yun unharmed while facing Yang Xiong’s attacks.

“I’ll see how long you can last!” Yang Xiong’s eyes flashed with annoyance as he had a rough gauge of this sword array’s limit. “Thunderblaze Mantra—Demonic Annihilation Halberd!”

Flames and lightning intertwined to form a violet halberd that shot towards Lin Yun.

“Great!” Lin Yun smiled. “Iris Sword Array—Absolute Unrivaled!”

The sword array began to rotate and a boundless sword intent surged from Lin Yun. The eighty-one swords instantly became a hundred and sixty two swords as they soared into the sky. In the next second, the swords started clashing with the halberd as the fluctuation from their attacks raised powerful waves in the surroundings.

It didn’t take long for the halberd to collapse as the swords shot towards Yang Xiong.

“Get lost!” Yang Xiong stepped forward and he threw both his fists out. He relied on his powerful cultivation to destroy the incoming swords before charging at Lin Yun.

But just when he moved, spiritual runes began to appear around Lin Yun as they intertwined to form a majestic spiritual diagram made of flames.

“How annoying…” Yang Xiong shook his arms at the spiritual diagram coming his way. “No matter what you do, you’ll only end up as my stepping stone.

His arms turned into claws as he tore the spiritual diagram apart. The spiritual diagram broke apart like fireworks.

“Let’s end this!” Yang Xiong slanted his body forward and dove down like an eagle.

Lin Yun narrowed his eyes looking at Yang Xiong charging over. If Yang Xiong thought that this was all Lin Yun had, then he was a little too naive.

Lin Yun raised his brow as a boundless killing aura exploded from his body. This made the faces of those looking at Lin Yun change. “This is…”

“How is his killing aura so terrifying!”

“Just how did he manage to condense such a killing aura?”

“That’s the Seven Slaughtering Fist!” Tang Yu and Yu Mu were both shocked by this scene.

“The Seven Slaughtering Fist…this young lad actually had such talent?” The white-haired elder sitting beside them was surprised as he wore a smile.
