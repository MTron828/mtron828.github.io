Chapter 1808 - Blood Dripping From The Sword

The appearance of the Glory Saint Artifact instantly made Liu Feng, Liu Yunfei, and Liu Cheng’s faces become greedy behind the Wind Edge Lord. The three were elders of the Liu Saint Clan, and they had high treatment. But their weapons weren’t even at the level of a hundred thousand rune saint artifact.

Hundred thousand rune saint artifacts were extremely rare, and it would be great if a Samsara Edict Realm expert could possess one. But even a hundred thousand rune saint artifact was incomparable to a Glory Saint Artifact.

If they had a Glory Saint Artifact, they could even compete with experts at the Profound Death Stage, and this meant that their strength would rise by leaps and bounds.

The Wind Edge Lord’s pupils flickered with greed, and he was determined that Lin Yun had to die today, no matter what. Even if they didn’t have a feud before, just the Glory Saint Artifact was enough of a reason for the Wind Edge Lord to kill him.

“Go! Kill him and I’ll reward each of you with a hundred thousand rune saint artifact!” The Wind Edge Lord said coldly.

Upon receiving his command, Liu Feng, Liu Cheng, and Liu Yunfei jumped off the black turtle boat and headed towards Lin Yun from different directions. Even if Lin Yun possessed a Glory Saint Artifact, he was only at the eighth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. Liu Hai didn’t know about the Glory Saint Artifact, and this was why he inexplicably died.

So the three weren’t afraid of Lin Yun, not to mention they were ganging up on him. Most importantly, the three were at the third stage Profound Life Stage, and they were stronger than the deceased Liu Hai. The difference between the second and third stage Profound Life Stages might only be a stage, but the actual difference was more terrifying than one imagined.

If they fought, they were confident that any of them could easily take down Liu Hai within ten-odd moves. The strongest among them was Liu Cheng, and he had reached the pinnacle third stage Profound Life Stage. He was only half a step away from the fourth.

He charged at Lin Yun head-on, while Liu Feng and Liu Yunfei sandwiched Lin Yun from the sides. They wanted to interfere with Lin Yun’s Sword Heart’s judgement capabilities. Liu Cheng might be strong, but it was an issue for him to deal with Lin Yun, who brought out his Sword Heart and Flower Burial Sword.

In a frontal confrontation, Lin Yun’s sword aura fell into a disadvantageous position, not to mention there were two others harassing him. So he could only retreat quickly.

Liu Cheng had a myriad rune saint artifact, and it was a black blade. He also had solid skills with the blade. Even if he only grasped the Firmament Blade Intent, his blade technique was extraordinary throughout the century.

A casual blow from him could cause heaven and earth to shatter, fully displaying the power of the Profound Life Stage. As his blade ray flashed, heavy rain fell onto the region, and this made Liu Cheng grin as he firmly suppressed Lin Yun.

At this instance, he unleashed nine blades. This was a high-grade ghost spirit martial technique. Whenever he swung his blade, a huge crack of over a few thousand meters would appear on the sea.

As nine sword rays intertwined, the sea was sliced into pieces with unstable fluctuations spreading out in the surrounding space.

On the other hand, Liu Yunfei and Liu Feng supported him from both sides. They didn’t get close to Lin Yun and launched remote attacks to tangle Lin Yun up.

“Lin Xiao, that Glory Saint Artifact is a waste in your hands. You can’t bring out its full strength. Concede and surrender it to my young master!” Liu Cheng laughed as he swung his blade down once more. This blade was fast, brushing past Lin Yun’s face.

Lin Yun dodged, while Liu Hai merely stood there swinging his blade around, unleashing countless blade rays. Although Lin Yun managed to resist the attacks, he still retreated to ten miles away before he regained his foothold.

But before he could catch his breath, two fingers streaked over to him, one aimed at his forehead and the other at his back. They were from Liu Feng and Liu Yunfei. They both unleashed their strongest attacks from a distance. This was a high-grade ghost spirit martial technique. In the hands of a Profound Life Stage, it could unleash terrifying power. This technique was called the Dragon Tribulation Finger, a martial technique of the Liu Saint Clan.

The two rays were powerful, causing the surrounding space to tremble with a faint dragon roar echoing out. The trajectory of those rays was tricky, and he would fall for them if he wasn’t careful. With their cultivation, Lin Yun would be heavily injured if he took their attacks head-on.

Lin Yun released his Sword Heart. He could see the incoming attacks, and carefully unleashed multiple sword rays to block the attacks. He had a strong talent when it came to the sword, and the Sword Heart allowed him to sense any changes in the surroundings. But the harassment had tied his hands up, and his sword was like a trapped dragon.

He had to find a way to take those two down first. His eyes began to flicker, and he swiftly searched for a solution in his mind.

“Brat, take another blade from me!” Just as he was figuring out a solution, Liu Cheng already dashed over. He had appeared behind Lin Yun with his blade slashing down.

But Lin Yun reacted as though he had a pair of eyes behind him. He turned around and pricked with his sword, hitting the opening of his blade, and dissolving this dangerous strait.

“This is the power of the Sword Heart?” The Wind Edge Lord was anxious as he watched the battle from the Black Tortoise Ship. If he could grasp Sword Heart, who at the Samsara Edict Realm could compete with him? It was simply a waste for Lin Yun to have it!

He could sense Lin Yun’s Glory Saint Artifact, but not the Sword Heart. This instantly made the Wind Edge Lord feel irritated. He made up his mind to torture Lin Yun later after the elders captured him.

Using a sword ray to dissolve the blade ray, Lin Yun ignored Liu Cheng and ran away. He pushed his movement technique to the limit, turning into a golden streak of light.

“Run? You think you can get away?” Liu Cheng laughed and closely followed behind him.

Liu Feng and Liu Yunfei, who were responsible for harassing Lin Yun, also exchanged a gaze before they chased after Lin Yun as well.

This scene made the Wind Edge Lord wear a smile upon seeing Lin Yun fleeing for his life. But did he think he could leave? Since he decided to make a move, he was confident that he could kill Lin Yun today.

As Lin Yun ran, he would occasionally turn around and use his sword to block the incoming blade rays.

Half a stick of incense later, Lin Yun and Liu Cheng were already thousands of miles away. The two were so fast that they shook Liu Yunfei, Liu Feng, and the Wind Edge Lord away.

When Lin Yun suddenly stopped, Liu Cheng snickered, “Can’t run any longer? A Dragon Pulse Realm like you wants to compete with someone at the Profound Life Stage in terms of stamina? How foolish you are!”

Lin Yun suddenly turned around and said, “The profound life aura is mysterious, and it’s not something someone at the Dragon Pulse Realm can resist.”

“It’s good that you know. It’s futile, no matter how strong your movement technique, sword technique, or foundation is! Without reaching the Samsara Edict Realm, you’re nothing! Even if you can run, you can’t shake me off!”

“Maybe, but I had no intentions of running, to begin with.” Lin Yun said.

As the corner of Liu Cheng’s lip rose to a mocking smile, he scoffed, “That’s what everyone says when they’re at their wit's end.”

But Lin Yun’s face was calm and composed. When he moved, he took the initiative to charge at Liu Cheng, traveling across a thousand meters in the blink of an eye. He even circulated his dragon origin and poured them into the Nine Lotus Diagram within his body. As a golden radiance burst out from his body, a scroll flew out.

“Finally going to summon your constellation?” Liu Cheng sneered. But he soon noticed that something wasn’t right. When the scroll unfolded, Liu Cheng could immediately sense an extremely dangerous aura enveloping him.

But it was already too late for him to do anything. When the scroll unfolded, Lin Yun sheathed his sword and executed the Nine Lotus Saint Seal.

As he began to form seals, beads of sweat covered his forehead, and he was struggling. But the painting created with divine runes ultimately opened up.

When the painting opened up, Liu Cheng, who jumped a thousand meters away, was suddenly pulled over with a powerful suction force. As he slowly got close to the Nine Lotus Diagram, he was soon sucked into the painting.

“Fwooo!” Lin Yun breathed a sigh of relief and grabbed onto the painting.

“What is this place?! Lin Xiao, let me out!

“Let me out!” Within the Nine Lotus Painting, Liu Cheng was horrified while standing by the lake and executed various martial techniques to attack the surroundings.

Lin Yun could feel the painting trembling and knew that Liu Cheng was on the verge of breaking free. He instantly knew that it was still somewhat forceful for him because he hadn’t grasped the Nine Lotus Diagram entirely. This was because the nine lotuses in the painting have yet to undergo a transformation. But it was enough for him to deal with someone like Liu Cheng.

“Inside there is a treasured place, so you can enjoy your time there.” Lin Yun said before ignoring Liu Cheng. The Nine Lotus Diagram was truly a treasure and Lin Yun didn’t lie to him. But it was a pity that Liu Cheng didn’t have the Blue Dragon Bone.

So once the nine lotuses got close to him, he wouldn’t be able to last long and would have his vitality sucked dry.

Back then, when Lin Yun entered the Nine Lotus Diagram, the inside was eerie and who knew how many people died inside there? But in order to control it, one needed the Nine Lotus Saint Seal, and he couldn’t be disturbed.

This was the reason why he lured Liu Cheng over. It was to shake off the other two so that he would have enough time to execute the Nine Lotus Saint Seal and deal with Liu Cheng.

Right then, two figures descended from the ground, Liu Feng and Liu Yunfei.

“Where’s Liu Cheng?”

“Bastard, where’s Liu Cheng?!” The two swept their gazes around and roared when they couldn’t see Liu Cheng anywhere. They could faintly see Lin Yun bringing out a treasure and Liu Cheng disappearing. So this naturally made them feel uneasy.

“It’s fine. You two will accompany him soon.” Lin Yun stowed the Nine Lotus Diagram and looked at the two.

“You’re courting death!” Liu Yunfei and Liu Feng released their killing intent before executing the Dragon Tribulation Finger. This caused billows to rise on the sea, raising multiple water screens.

“Sword!” Lin Yun placed his right hand before his chest and formed a seal. When the Flower Burial Sword flew out from the sheath, it flew towards Liu Feng.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

This made Liu Feng’s face change, and he quickly dodged the incoming attack. But even after he dodged the sword, the sword quickly turned around and flew over.

Then, the Flower Burial Sword summoned Lin Yun over, and he disappeared. When he reappeared, his hand had grabbed onto the sword.

“Liu Feng, watch out!” Liu Yunfei exclaimed, and he rose to the sky before pushing his palms forth.

In the next second, he unleashed hundreds of rays forth, raining toward Lin Yun and sealing the area he was in.

Liu Feng took this opportunity to retreat. When he saw Lin Yun struck by the rays, he immediately rejoiced. But his face soon changed in the next moment after watching Lin Yun shatter apart with no blood splashing around.

“It’s an afterimage!” Liu Feng quickly turned around, and saw that Lin Yun had somehow appeared behind Liu Yunfei with the Flower Burial Sword in his hand. His pupils immediately squinted, and he yelled, “No!”

When a sword ray flew past, blood splashed with a decapitated head falling in the sea.

As Lin Yun descended, he swiftly ran into the sea and approached Liu Feng. When the latter descended, he turned around and ran for his life without any hesitation. He had lost his fighting spirit after witnessing how Liu Yunfei was killed.

But the moment he turned around, Lin Yun already appeared before him. Lin Yun, donned in his white robe that was fluttering in the wind, slowly sheathed his sword. The sword was still covered with blood when he sheathed it.

As he slowly sheathed his sword, a hissing sound resounded with blood dripping down from the sheath, falling into the sea.

“What’s going on? He’s clearly behind me earlier… Wait…” Liu Feng’s thoughts were a mess, and he couldn’t figure out what just happened.

A streak of blood suddenly appeared on his forehead, flowing downward. It turned out that he had already died when he turned around.

When Lin Yun completely sheathed his sword, Liu Yunfei’s body was vertically split into two.
