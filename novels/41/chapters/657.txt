Chapter 658 - Azure Dragon Energy

When the Silverthunder Demonhawk died, blood poured out its skin. In the blink of an eye, the crater turned into a crimson pond that contained boundless spiritual essence.

Standing beside the crater, Lin Yun was shocked to see how swiftly the thousand meter wide pond was filled. The dense spiritual energy coming from the pond originated from the Silverthunder Demonhawk.

But Lin Yun knew that he wouldn’t be able to refine it because the demonic aura was too dense. Even if he refined it, it would be a loss for him since the efficiency would be low. However, this was not the case for Lil’ Red. It jumped into the pond and began devouring the spiritual energy.

Lin Yun scoffed upon seeing the usually ferocious Lil’ Red act like this. In fact, whenever Lil’ Red encountered a powerful enemy, it would run faster than anyone else. Now that the Silverthunder Demonhawk was dealt with, Lil’ Red ran back once more.

Lin Yun knew that luck was a huge factor in this battle. The most dangerous moment was when the Silverthunder Demonhawk took a strike from the Indigoflame Thunderwhip and recovered instantly. If it managed to fly into the sky, Lin Yun knew that he would have lost the battle.

Luckily for him, he was the last one standing. This brought joy to Lin Yun’s face as he jumped into the pond. Enveloping himself with his sword energy as protection, Lin Yun walked towards the Silverthunder Demonhawk’s corpse.

The Flower Burial Sword was plunged into the ground by the side and emitted a dreamy light. Lin Yun sheathed it and then retrieved the beast core from the corpse.

When the beast core was revealed, it released a dazzling silver light that lit up the entire region covered in crimson mist. This beast core was glittering with beauty and was unlike any other beast core Lin Yun had seen in the past. In fact, it didn’t look like a beast core, but more like a treasure without any impurities.

“This…” This was Lin Yun’s first time seeing such a pure beast core and he was shocked. However, he figured it out very quickly. The Silverthunder Demonhawk was this region’s overlord, so it had moderated its eating to every few months.

This meant that it must’ve spent a lot of time refining its beast core. It fell under the category of an intelligent demonic beast. However, not many demonic beasts were intelligent since most of them were barbaric and unreasonable. If this Silverthunder Demonhawk had enough time, it could become a Heavenly Soul Realm with time. So this meant that he had killed a future Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beast.

“Time to refine it.” Looking at Lil’ Red devouring the Silverthunder Demonhawk’s corpse, Lin Yun smiled as he soared into the sky. The Draconic Banquet was still half a year away. The amount of time was short and Lin Yun didn’t have much time left.

Especially since the Bloodwing Pavilion might have been annihilated by the expert behind Su Ziyao. If that was true, then it would mean that her background was terrifyingly powerful.

The Profound Monarch Palace… If his memory served him right, no such force existed in the Ancient Southern Domain. However, he had once sworn that he would grab Su Ziyao even if she was in the nine heavens. He was resolved to have her no matter what.

For his love, he was determined to reach the pinnacle of the martial path. As many thoughts flashed through his mind, Lin Yun’s expression became grave as he held onto the beast core.

“What powerful lightning energy!” The Profound Lightning Bead had weakened greatly after being refined a few times and this beast core wasn’t inferior to it in any way. This was why Lin Yun was shocked when he sensed the energy within the core.

Closing his eyes, Lin Yun circulated the Azure Dragon Enneaform and a powerful suction force exploded out from his palm that absorbed the lightning energy from the beast core into his body. When the lightning energy flowed into his body, Lin Yun’s clothes were shredded into pieces, so much so that cracks also started to appear on the ground.

As lightning intertwined and crackled on Lin Yun’s body, the Azure Dragon Mark’s color changed from purple to a deep crimson. The mark didn’t have any crimson, so this change was extremely peculiar. Meanwhile, the Azure Dragon Enneaform was heading towards the pinnacle third stage.

As time passed, the Azure Dragon Mark grew even more brilliant as the terrifying dragon might continued to accumulate. Simultaneously, the eighteen lightning runes grew thicker and more sinister. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

An hour later, lightning crackled on Lin Yun’s body as a new lightning rune appeared. This meant that another cauldron’s worth of strength had been converted into a lightning rune.

“That was fast!” Lin Yun rejoiced as this speed was unprecedented. His cultivation speed was ten times faster than normal. It looks like he made the right bet.

As lightning continued to flicker on his body, strong energy surged inside his body that brought along stinging pain. But fortunately, Lin Yun’s physique was a lot stronger than it had been in the past.

So he could tolerate the pain surging in his body. Although it was dangerous, Lin Yun could endure it.

One, two, three... Time passed as more lightning runes began to appear on Lin Yun’s body. When he reached twenty-three lightning runes, his body gave off an explosive power. His physique had clearly grown stronger, but at the same time, it was leaner. While it strengthened his physique, it also granted him agility. It wasn’t like other cultivation techniques that would only bring an explosive transformation to the body.

The Azure Dragon Enneaform balanced explosive strength and agility. After all, the Azure Dragon controlled the wind and lightning energies as it reigned in the sky. Simply having strength and explosive power wasn’t enough as speed was also necessary.

Simultaneously, the purple origin energy within his body started to merge with the lightning energy. As for the remaining lightning energy that didn’t merge with his body, it was devoured by the Iris Sword Sutra. With this, Lin Yun could sense that his origin energy was growing at a rapid speed.

Although the improvement in his cultivation wasn’t as fast as using the Azurewood Wine, it could bring Lin Yun to the pinnacle Yang stage. At his current cultivation, it was too unrealistic for him to have an explosive improvement in the Violet Palace Realm. But it might not be a piece of bad news, since the Silverthunder Demonhawk was different from other demonic beasts.

Four days later, when the last cauldron’s worth of strength was refined into a lightning rune, Lin Yun could sense the feeling of satisfaction spreading throughout his body. It felt like a crude jade had been crafted into something beautiful.

At this moment, Lin Yun felt like he had officially stepped into the Azure Dragon Enneaform. The energy flowing through his body suddenly emitted a dazzling silver light full of dragon aura and dominance.

This was the Azure Dragon’s energy. Sensing the transformation in his strength, Lin Yun instantly became emotional. This was just like how he had the dracophant energy when he cultivated the Dracophant Battle Physique.

He had cultivated the Azure Dragon Enneaform for a while, but only now had he undergone a total transformation. This made Lin Yun feel satisfied as he burst out laughing.

There was no question that the azure dragon energy was a lot stronger than the dracophant energy. He could still clearly remember when he first found the Azure Dragon’s blood in the empyrean’s tomb. He could sense that the dracophant energy within his body was trembling in fear and that the fear came from the bottom of his heart.

When Lin Yun opened his eyes, they flashed brightly as they leaked terrifying pressure. With a wave of his hand, he retrieved the Indigoflame Thunderwhip. This time, the Indigoflame Thunderwhip seemed more lively as flames spread out on it when he held onto it.

“Can you sense it?” Lin Yun smiled. He naturally felt confident with this transcendent cosmic artifact, even though there was a seal on it. After all, he was used to wielding a weapon that had a mind of its own.

“I’ll make you completely submit to me one day!” Lin Yun snorted as the thirty lightning runes began to squirm on his chest and boundless pressure exploded out. When the terrifying power coursed through his body, the ground began to tremble violently.

With thirty lightning runes pouring into the Indigoflame Thunderwhip from Lin Yun’s hand, the whip came to life as it squirmed violently with a ferocious howl. Under its howl, even the sky began to tremble violently.

“How heavy!” Lin Yun’s face sank as he could sense the Indigoflame Thunderwhip becoming heavier. The power of the whip continued to grow, signifying that Lin Yun was constantly unlocking its potential.

“Go!” When he unlocked 80% of its potential, sweat began to appear on Lin Yun’s forehead as the whip flew out.

The sky turned dark as a boundless domineering pressure burst forward. The Indigoflame Thunderwhip was like a dragon bursting out from the surface of the water. When it was about to land onto the ground, the pressure had condensed into a golden dragon.

When the whip hit the ground, it left a huge crack that began to spread out.

“This…” Lin Yun gasped for air with disbelief and joy in his eyes. If this attack landed on the Silverthunder Demonhawk, it wouldn’t have had a chance to turn the tables around.

Right at this moment, a violent aura burst out from the crater as the blood mist began to gather onto Lil’ Red like a vortex.

“A second evolution?” Lin Yun smiled with anticipation in his eyes. He had high hopes for Lil’ Red as he had considered Lil’ Red to be a friend.
