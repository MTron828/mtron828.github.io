Chapter 1339 - You’re Ugly

“Haha, say whatever you want. Anyhow, you have no path of retreat now. Let’s see who can hold out.” Nangong Ze coldly said while stabbing his blade into the ground.

“Who the hell do you think you are? If I had my blade with me, I would’ve killed you a long time ago. Yet, you dare to call yourself the strongest bladesman? Where did you get the guts to make that declaration?” Cang Yun looked at Nangong Ze with disdain in his eyes. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“You baldie!” Nangong Ze flew into a rage when he heard that.

“What are you looking at? Even if I’m bald, I’m still a lot more handsome than you. This means that you’re not even comparable to a monk like me!” Cang Yun smiled.

“Fuck!” Nangong Ze was on the verge of losing it because Cang Yun’s mouth was too vile.

“Calm down. He’s just putting on a strong front. He won’t be able to last for long, so there’s no need for you to be rash now. He won’t have any chance of escaping!” Ning Feng smiled, donned in his ancient armor.

“What are you smiling at? There’s nothing to be proud of when you dress yourself up like a green tortoise. Remove that armor if you have the guts and see how this daddy kills you!” Cang Yun furiously glared at Ning Feng because Ning Feng was the strongest amongst them with his ancient armor. In the previous battle, Ning Feng had injured him the most.

Ning Feng’s smile froze on his face when he heard what Cang Yun said. What did he mean by a green tortoise? This is an ancient armor, not a tortoise shell.

Ning Feng immediately flew into a rage when he heard that and wanted to charge forth, but Zhang Jin quickly grabbed him.

“Don’t come over! If you guys dare to come over, then I’ll destroy this ancient martial stone tablet!” Cang Yun yelled.

“Don’t pull me back! This baldie needs a beating!” Ning Feng was furious as he began to glow with emerald light.

Nangong Ze sneaked a peek at Ning Feng before he softly muttered, “You’re really green…”

Ning Feng’s face immediately turned black when he heard that. But Nangong Ze quickly shut his mouth and continued, “Don’t be impulsive. If he destroys the ancient martial stone tablet, then we’ll be leaving here empty-handed!”

Right at that moment, Tang Jing, who was standing beside Luo Shuyi, smiled, “Cang Yun, don’t be like this. We’re not making things difficult for you on purpose. You just have to let us copy the content on the tablet and we won’t make things difficult for you.”

“Get lost!” Cang Yun scolded. “You’re just a dog beside Luo Shuyi. Who the hell do you think you are? You were the most excited one earlier and even your eyes had turned green. The Profound Valley has the deepest research on stone tablets, and I bet a wretched fellow like you already knows the secret on the stone tablet!”

When the other fated transcendents heard that, they all began to inwardly laugh because they knew that Tang Jing was no different from Luo Shuyi’s puppy. Even an idiot could tell that he had feelings for Luo Shuyi, and Cang Yun was probably the only one who dared to call him ‘Luo Shuyi’s dog’ in public.

When Tang Jing heard Cang Yun’s insults, his face turned green and he couldn’t even utter a single word.

“You really know the origin of that stone tablet?” While Tang Jing became furious, Luo Shuyi’s voice resounded beside him.

Calming himself down, Tang Jing transmitted his voice over, “A little. The stone tablet has a portion of the Divine Sunchasing Art recorded on it, but that’s not the most important thing about it. This stone tablet seems to be a treasure in itself.”

Luo Shuyi had no changes on her face, but she knew that the stone tablet probably had a huge origin if it was a treasure.

“Cang Yun, stop wasting our time and hand the stone tablet over for us to make a copy.” Dugu Yan said in an annoyed tone because he felt that they were really wasting time here.

But Cang Yun replied in disdain, “We’re all fated transcendents from powerful sects, so who the hell do you think you are? You claim yourself to be invincible in the sword and comparable to fated transcendents like us? What happened in the end? You’re toyed around in Lin Yun’s hands like a baby kneeling three times. If I was in your position, I would’ve buried my head in the ground long ago.”

When Dugu Yan heard that, his face drastically changed. He felt that anyone who mentioned Lin Yun right now had to die.

“Furious?” Cang Yun smiled upon seeing the rage on Dugu Yan’s face and raised his voice, “Don’t you have the Azure Thunder Sword Eyes? Why don’t you open them and kill this daddy?”

Cang Yun was arrogant because he had no fear. Because the Azure Thunder Sword Eyes was powerful, it had to be nourished with vitality, and Dugu Yan still didn’t have complete control over it. Dugu Yan had already opened them in his fight with Lin Yun, so if he opened them again, then he would definitely injure himself.

“Haha, no guts to do that? Then keep your mouth shut. Talk only if you dare to open your eyes. If you dare to open your eyes, then this daddy will poke your dog eyes to make sure that they’re blind!” Cang Yun stretched out two fingers and made a poking gesture.

But suddenly, Cang Yun’s face drastically changed and he jumped off the ground. In the next moment, the spot that he was previously standing on exploded into fragments. When Cang Yun raised his head, Dugu Yan had already opened his eyes, and sword rays were shining brightly in his pupils with a devastating aura surging in his pupils. The moment Dugu Yan opened his eyes, even the entire heaven and earth began to tremble, causing everyone’s faces to change as they quickly retreated.

“Screw you. Dugu Three Kneels, you really dare to open your eyes!” Cang Yun’s face had turned pale and quickly hid himself. But Dugu Yan had gone insane with his hair fluttering in the wind as sword rays shot out from his eyes. The sword rays were extremely terrifying, even tearing space apart as lightning began to fall from the sky.

“Dugu Three Kneels, you’re mad!” Cang Yun could only continue to dodge the sword rays from Dugu Yan, but he was still caught up in the shockwave and threw out blood. Even the golden glow around his body was torn apart by the sword rays.

Not long later, Cang Yun was already covered in blood and the entire mountain was blown apart, scaring Nangong Ze and the other fated transcendents to flee for their lives. But right at this moment, Dugu Yan also fell on one knee with his eyes closed and blood rolling down his cheeks.

When Cang Yun saw this scene, he immediately rejoiced and smiled. “Dugu Yan, thank you! I guarantee that I won’t call you Dugu Three Kneels in the future. Now then, this daddy will be taking his leave!”

Taking this opportunity, Cang Yun leaped off the mountain and began to flee for his life. When he fled, he didn’t look injured at all.

“After him!” Nangong Ze and the rest nearly threw out a mouthful of blood because Cang Yun was really fast at running.

But right at that moment, Cang Yun, who was about to disappear, suddenly returned and stopped beside Luo Shuyi while he rubbed his skinhead, “Lady Luo, I have been admiring you for a long time, day and night. If you smile and wink your eyes at me today, I’ll renounce being a monk this day!”

Tang Jing, who was chasing him, was stumped when he saw this scene.

“Sure.” Luo Shuyi smiled with a wink.

Seeing that Luo Shuyi went along with him, Tang Jing laughed, “Hahaha. Tang Jing, you see that? Continue to be a dog and you’ll have nothing!”

After he finished his laughter, he immediately turned around and continued to flee, leaving Tang Jing, who had his face turned green, behind.

“Well, since you’re going to renounce being a monk, then stay behind…” Luo Shuyi smiled and reached out to Cang Yun’s chest. Her voice was bewitching, echoing beside Cang Yun’s ears. This scared Cang Yun to the point of hugging the stone tablet even tighter.

Seeing that Cang Yun increased his defense on the stone tablet, Luo Shuyi gave up on snatching the stone tablet and her palm landed on Cang Yun’s chest instead. This made Cang Yun throw out a mouthful of blood as he rolled down the mountain. When he got back on his feet, Cang Yun could only feel a chill down his spine and his back was already covered in a cold sweat.

“Luo Shuyi, are you trying to kill your husband?!” Cang Yun immediately continued to flee and didn’t dare to even stay for a moment because Luo Shuyi was too terrifying.

“Little monk, stop running from this big sister.” Luo Shuyi continued to chase after Cang Yun. But he was simply too fast and had already fled the mountain. The blood dripping from his body even formed a long track on the ground that looked like a small stream, and this scene made those fated transcendents who were chasing Cang Yun shocked by how ruthless he was to himself.

“He fled…” Tang Jing said furiously.

“He won’t be able to flee.” Luo Shuyi smiled and slowly strum her fingers in the air.

As an illusion of a celestial fairy appeared behind her, the celestial fairy would play the zither in her hands whenever Luo Shuyi strums her fingers in mid-air. This made Cang Yun, who was already far away, to stagger and throw out another mouthful of blood.

But Cang Yun gritted his teeth and continued to flee. The stronger the people who came after him were, the more he would feel that the value of this treasure was immeasurable.

“Baby, I’ve thrown out so much blood for you, so you better not disappoint this monk.” Cang Yun smiled as he looked at the stone tablet in his embrace.

But as the zither music continued, not only did it make Cang Yun slow down, but the golden light he was giving off also gradually dimmed down. The moment the golden light was completely diminished, then he wouldn’t be far from death.

As Qin Cang ran while throwing out blood, he could feel that his physique was reaching its limit and rubbed his skinhead with a smile, “She’s really charming. Looks like I’ve suffered greatly by becoming a monk.”

As he chuckled, he suddenly turned around and golden light began to shine from him. At this moment, he looked like a gigantic buddha filled with prestige. As an ancient mantra resounded from the surroundings, Cang Yun let out a roar in the direction of Luo Shuyi with a white qilin appearing behind him.

When the soundwave from his mouth swept out, all the trees and debris in its path were reduced to ashes. The celestial fairy behind Luo Shuyi also lasted for a brief moment before it disappeared. Seeing this, Cang Yun laughed before he continue to flee for his life, “Hahaha! Wait for me, wifey! When we’re out of the Profound Wither Valley, I’ll request for your hand from the Heavenly Note Sect!”

His voice was loud, not to mention that it was further empowered by the ancient mantra. So everyone around the mountain could clearly hear him. When Luo Shuyi heard that, the smile on her face disappeared and was replaced with frost. Even Tang Jing, who was standing beside her, wore an awkward expression while he fidgeted around.

Right at this moment, Nangong Ze came over, wielding his blade, and smiled, “Luo Shuyi, you really agreed to that? Actually, you can consider me. At the very least, I’m a hundred times better than that baldie.”

Luo Shuyi turned around and looked at Nangong Ze for a long time before she indifferently said, “You’re ugly.”

When Nangong Ze heard that, his face instantly became black. Just how am I ugly?!
