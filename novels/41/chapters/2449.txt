Chapter 2450 - Black and White

“Everyone prepare to make a trip to the Ancient Barren Domain,” the Empress said, looking at all the emperors present.

“I wonder to what extent does the Empress want us to go? Kill the Radiant Sword Saint?” The White Emperor spoke out. He continued, “If you want to do that, there’s no need for Tian Xuanzi to spend so much effort. Over the past few hundred years, there have been plenty of opportunities to kill him, so we do not need to disregard the rules now.”

The White Emperor was straightforward with his words and was dissatisfied with the Empress.

The Blade Emperor reprimanded, “How dare you! Who do you think you’re talking to right now?”

The White Emperor raised his wine gourd and said, “I won’t kill the Radiant Sword Saint, and I won’t make a move. Even Tian Xuanzi knew about that, so are we inferior to him?”

In a nutshell, the reason wasn’t on their side. They might feel guilty about letting Tian Xuanzi do it and could pretend not to see it, but the White Emperor wouldn’t make a move himself to take the Radiant Sword Saint’s life. It wouldn’t be easy for the Radiant Sword Saint to make it through his tribulation based on the phenomenon alone, and yet the Empress still wanted them to make a move.

“If you want the Radiant Sword Saint’s death, the Empress can make a move yourself. If Yu Qingfeng stands out, I’ll do my best to stop him,” the White Emperor said, gulping down a mouthful of wine.

The Blade Emperor’s face was cold with anger upon hearing what the White Emperor said.

The Flame Emperor was briefly stunned before he persuaded, “Whitey, what are you talking about? Chen Yan told us to head to the Ancient Barren Domain, not to kill the Radiant Sword Saint. If it were to kill him, she would’ve made a move long ago.”

None of the Nine Emperors were willing to kill the Radiant Sword Saint since the reason wasn’t on their side. They represented the orthodoxy of the Kunlun Realm. They weren’t demonic cultivators who could kill whoever they wanted, and the Radiant Sword Saint wasn’t a demonic cultivator but a well-reputed sword saint.

In addition to Yu Qingfeng, it wasn’t appropriate for them to make a move personally. Aside from that, they were mythical emperors, and it would go against their hearts to kill the Radiant Sword Saint.

Tian Xuanzi was the perfect chess piece to do that because he was the Profound Sky Sect’s sect master and could be considered a junior trying to challenge the Radiant Sword Saint. At the very least, no one would say anything about it. But now that it has died, this placed the Empress in an awkward position.

The Empress indifferently said, “You all only have to be stationed at the Ancient Barren Domain. Someone will make a move with regards to the Radiant Sword Saint.”

“Since that’s the case, we’ve misunderstood the Empress,” the White Emperor said, looking drunk.

“Roger that!” The Black Emperor cupped his fists together and dragged the White Emperor away.

The Blade Emperor’s face was cold. This wasn’t the first time he saw the White Emperor behave this way.

As for the Flame Emperor, he merely squinted, and no one knew what he was thinking.

The Empress looked at the Flame Emperor and said, “If the Radiant Sword Saint succeeds in his tribulation, there’s no need to pay any attention to him. But we must obtain the dragon vein beneath the Sword Sect, no matter what.”

The Flame Emperor nodded.

“What about Whitey? This isn’t the first time he dared to be rude,” the Blade Emperor said.

A hint of murderous intent flashed across the Empress’ eyes, and she coldly said, “He better be drunk for real.”

After the discussion was over, everyone was tactful and said nothing about Su Ziyao.

After leaving the golden cloud, the White Emperor breathed out and returned to clarity. He didn’t look drunk at all.

“You knew she wouldn’t ask us to kill the Radiant Sword Saint. So why did you try to argue with her while pretending to be drunk?” The Black Emperor asked.

A hint of cold appeared on the White Emperor’s face, and he said, “That’s just a disclaimer in case she thoroughly falls out.”

“Are you going to fall out with her?” The Black Emperor asked, not surprised by that.

The White Emperor said, “I’ve made up my mind. What about you?”

As the saying goes, Whitey doesn’t drink, and Blacky doesn’t kill. The two were often seen together, and they would make decisions together. After all, they were companions for thousands of years.

The Black Emperor said nothing and fell silent.

“The Blade Emperor is a lackey, currying up the Empress for thousands of years, and he will stand by Chen Yan. As for the Flame Emperor...” The White Emperor continued, “The Flame Emperor respects those stronger than him. He might choose not to help anyone if the situation is turned around. I didn’t have a choice before, but I have made up my mind now. Blacky, you have to help me!”

The White Emperor said, anxiously looking at the Black Emperor. He couldn’t confront the Empress by himself and needed the Black Emperor’s help if they wanted some odds of winning.

The Black Emperor said, “Sure if you’re talking about helping you. But if you want me to face the Empress, you must give me a reason to do that. You know that I’ve always supported her.”

The Black Emperor was in favor of the Empress’ method.

“Killing a million to save ten thousand?” The White Emperor mocked. That was Yu Qingfeng’s words because the Empress planned to use the nine dragon veins to reach the Deity Realm. As for the damaged nine ancient domains, the life and death of the people there wouldn’t bother her.

“What if you’re the one to die?” The White Emperor asked.

“If my death can help her or the Radiant Sword Saint reach the Deity Realm, I wouldn’t hesitate,” the Black Emperor said.

The White Emperor became anxious because he knew the Black Emperor was willing to sacrifice himself for the Kunlun Realm.

“I didn’t object to it because I didn’t have a choice, but we have a choice now...” The White Emperor said anxiously. “Don’t tell me you didn’t notice that Lin Yun has grasped Nirvana Dao? He must’ve left the Kunlun Realm to obtain the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron and met the Iris Sword Saint or Ancestral Deity!”

The Black Emperor fell silent because he couldn’t refute that.

“The nine of us might be talented, but we couldn’t end that dark era without the Iris Sword Saint’s inheritance. We couldn’t become myths without it, and he left the best inheritance for Lin Yun!” The White Emperor said, anxiously wanting to persuade the Black Emperor.

“That’s all your speculation,” the Black Emperor muttered.

“Speculation? Didn’t you see that sword box and Nirvana Dao? No one taught him that in the Kunlun Realm!” The White Emperor said, coincidentally guessing the correct answer.

The Black Emperor’s face finally changed because this was a logic that he couldn’t refute. Even if it was a speculation, there was no flaw in it.

Since Lin Yun could grasp Nirvana Dao, his attainment in it wasn’t any weaker than the Iris Sword Saint from a hundred thousand years ago, and it was impossible to find anyone proficient in it in the Kunlun Realm.

Taking a deep breath, the White Emperor calmed down and said, “When the Southern Emperor died, we followed Chen Yan to establish the Divine Dragon Empire for our ambitions. Although no one blamed us for that, we all know we’ve gone against the Iris Sword Saint’s will.”

The Iris Sword Saint meant for them to bring back the Dragon’s Gate, but the Divine Dragon Empire was utterly opposite to that, occupying the best location in the Kunlun Realm to rule.

They were myths, and they had descendants. Even if they weren’t tempted, they had to consider their clan. Most importantly, the Empress also gave a method to reforge Heavenly Path. This was why everyone besides Yu Qingfeng agreed to establish the Divine Dragon Empire.

Now that the White Emperor mentioned it again, he must’ve seen hope in Lin Yun, an entirely different path.

Shaking his head, the Black Emperor said, “There are differences between Dragon’s Gate and the Divine Dragon Empire, and they’re unimportant.”

“Blacky, I still can’t persuade you in the end?” The White Emperor furiously roared, “If the world is righteous like you, her method is acceptable. But have you thought that some aren’t willing? What if the Radiant Sword Saint isn’t willing? What if the Sword Sect isn’t willing? Who are you to sacrifice the Sword Sect to reach the Deity Realm? What will happen to those who depended on the Sword Sect to live?”

The White Emperor’s face became sinister, and he continued, “Yu Qingfeng might not be reliable, but what he said is right. We can’t commit mistakes because the outcome is for the greater good!”

The Black Emperor looked at the White Emperor and said nothing.

“Let’s go our separate ways since we’re not on the same path. Take care! Don’t think I can be the same as you just because you’re willing to die for the Kunlun Realm!” The White Emperor said after a long time and was about to leave.

But when he turned around, the Black Emperor held onto him and said, “I merely maintained silence and didn’t say that I disagree with you.”

The White Emperor was dumbfounded when he heard that.

The Black Emperor continued, “There’s something you failed to notice. The bone armor on Lin Yun’s right arm should be the Heavenly Dragon Bone.”

“The Heavenly Dragon Bone?” The White Emperor squinted and asked, “You’ve seen it before?”

“I was the one who put it on Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain. I also created the Southern Emperor’s tomb in the outside world,” the Black Emperor said.

The White Emperor was stumped. He didn’t expect the Black Emperor to betray as well. He laughed, “Hahaha! Brilliant! That woman had been looking for it for thousands of years but couldn’t find the Heavenly Dragon Bone and Heavenly Fate Talisman! Hahaha! So it was hidden by you! You’ve been hiding deep!”

“In reality, the Empress’s method of becoming a deity was a backup plan proposed by the Southern Emperor. Even the array was perfected by him,” the Black Emperor said. “According to the Southern Emperor, that was a backup plan. After reforging the Heavenly Path and resolving the God Burial Mountain Range, he would sacrifice himself to become a deity-grade dragon vein as a sacrifice. But with the Empress’ personality, she definitely won’t have the Southern Emperor’s mindset if she became a deity.”

The White Emperor came to his senses and understood that it was all the Southern Emperor’s arrangement. He exclaimed, “We’ve stayed together for so many years, but you hid so much from me...”

The White Emperor thought of something, then roared, “So, were you acting earlier? Did you think that I’m someone on her side? Blacky, you’re frightening!”

“You’re the first to agree to the Empress’ establishment of the Divine Dragon Empire back then,” the Black Emperor said.

The White Emperor’s face froze, and was placed in an awkward position, unable to explain that.

“You go to the Frostsnow Sacred Palace while I head to the Black-White Sacred Palace,” the Black Emperor said.

“Not to the Ancient Barren Domain?”

“I’ll have to retrieve the Samsara Divine Rune first, the method to refine the Heavenly Dragon Bone, and some things from the Southern Emperor. The Freezing Chill Divine Rune is in the Frostsnow Sacred Palace. We’ll meet up in the Ancient Barren Domain,” the Black Emperor said, leaving the White Emperor stumped.

The Ice Emperor was an Emperor. But he wasn’t comparable to the Nine Emperors, and the White Emperor could easily convince him with his strength. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

The White Emperor asked, “How much have you prepared?”

“A lot. But our hope lies in Yu Qingfeng. You don’t have to wait for me if you get there early. The Flame and Blade Emperors will make a move on the dragon vein,” the Black Emperor said.

“So... you want me to fight them both?” The White Emperor was stumped.

“You’re not afraid of death; why are you afraid of fighting them both? Let me tell you something: the Empress has already reached the Quasi-Deity Realm and could suppress Yu Qingfeng. But she would suffer a great loss this time,” the Black Emperor said indifferently.

Quasi-Deity Realm? When did she achieve that? The White Emperor was stumped again. Despite staying together for so many years, he felt that he was a fool with everything hidden from him by the Black Emperor.
