Chapter 2136: Who Wasn’t Arrogant When They Were Young?

When An Liuyan looked at Lin Yun, all her grievances disappeared after hearing what he said. Her eyes shone brightly, tears rolling down as she wore a bright smile. An Liuyan bit her lips and looked at Lin Yun, “Young Master.”

“It’s fine now,” Lin Yun smiled. It had been a year since they last met, and she was filled with heart matters when he left, allowing Lin Yun to see another side of her. Beneath her charming and alluring appearance, she was a fragile woman.

“Yeah,” An Liuyan smiled. “It’s fine since the young master is here.”

“Let’s go. Don’t cry. Tell me which spot you want, and I’ll secure it for you,” Lin Yun said.

“It’s fine. As long as the young master is well,” An Liuyan smiled.

Lin Yun’s heart trembled because An Liuyan never asked for any request from him while standing behind him. She always quietly stood behind him with no desire and only hoped he would be well.

“I’m naturally fine, but I’m afraid that you have no choice but to accept even if you don’t want it,” Lin Yun said as he turned to look at Zhao Wu Sheng, Xiao Zhenya, and Yuan Hengying.

The three were briefly surprised by Lin Yun’s arrival before they restored their composure and coldly looked at him while hovering in the sky.

”Ye Qingtian, you’re really disgusting. You’re a genius from the righteous sect, yet you have a close relationship with a demoness from the demonic cult. Don’t you know any shame?” Xiao Zhenya of the Heavenly Saint Gate spoke out.

Zhao Wusheng held onto his chin, saying, “Ye Qingtian, you’re a swordsman prodigy of the past five hundred years, and you’ll become a Sword Saint in the future based on your talent. It’s not worth tarnishing your reputation for a demoness, so don’t be a shame to all swordsmen.”

Yuan Hengying was domineering as he coldly said, “Ye Qingtian, you’re a swordsman prodigy and the direct disciple of a Great Saint in the Heavenly Dao Sect. If you walk too close with a demoness like her, you’ll only make us look down on you.”

His tone contained dissatisfaction, and his words were full of disdain for An Liuyan’s identity. Everyone outside the Dragon Mountains was also shocked because no one expected that Ye Qingtian would give up the champion of the True Dragon Path for a demoness. This was unbelievable. It was fine if he was a Holy Maiden Killer because they were from the righteous sects, but he now had an unclear relationship with a demoness.

As strange gazes were directed over from the surroundings, many people secretly shook their heads. This made An Liuyan bite her lips as she lowered her head and hid behind Lin Yun. After all, there was a prejudice against demonesses in the world, and she didn’t want to drag Lin Yun down.

But Lin Yun grabbed An Liuyan’s wrist and dragged her to his side. No matter how An Liuyan tried, she couldn’t break free and could only look at Lin Yun.

“Do you think I care about how people think of me?” Lin Yun looked at the three with a playful gaze, and his eyes were filled with murderous intent. Who the hell did they think they were trying to teach him? Since he came to the Indigo Dragon Path, he had no intention of letting them go. Anyone who bullied his woman would have to pay the price.

Zhao Wusheng was furious upon hearing that, and pointed at Lin Yun, “A champion of the True Dragon Path dares to be so arrogant before us? Let go of her, or don’t blame us for being impolite with you!”

“Hahaha!” Lin Yun laughed with his hair fluttering. His expression became stern as he said, “You’re courting death to speak so brazenly to me. Who the hell do you think you are?!”

Lin Yun soared to the sky and came before Zhao Wusheng the next second. This didn’t make Zhao Wusheng furious but he rejoiced instead. It might be troublesome for them to deal with Ye Qingtian if they fought him one-on-one, but he entered their encirclement on his own accord.

“Let’s go! We don’t have to discuss fairness with the scum of the holy lands. Make him kneel and kowtow for his mistake!” Zhao Wusheng released his sword intent and laughed as he summoned his constellation. As multiple saint swords hovered behind him, it formed into a boundless sword aura, and he had also grasped the Astral Sword Intent. Under the empowerment of his constellation, his sword intent was still rising.

“Hehe, let’s go.”

“Let's teach this prodigy?a lesson!” Yuan Hengying and Xiao Zhenya summoned their constellations as they hovered in the air, enveloped in indigo saint aura. At the same time, four to five people were still attacking from outside the fray, unleashing various attacks.

“What futile effort!” Lin Yun snorted as he showed a rare dominance through his eyes. He executed the Dragon Sun and Moon Seal’s second variation, the Blood Dying Sky. He didn’t hesitate. He was like a divine dragon soaring to the sky with his dual stars empowered by the seal. His Astral Sword Intent was already terrifying, to begin with, but it had reached a whole new height at this moment.

As darkness covered the sky with a crimson light screen, a powerful sword intent swept out and sent Yuan Hengying and Xiao Zhenya flying before they could even get close. The entire heaven and earth trembled, and everyone in the surroundings retreated aside from An Liuyan, whom Lin Yun protected.

“Holy shit!”

“What a powerful sword intent!” Everyone was shocked as they looked at this scene with confusion.

This was the true power of the dual sword stars and the invincible demeanor of a swordsman prodigy. Under his might, Zhao Wusheng threw a mouthful of blood as his sword intent crumbled.

“How is this possible?!” Zhao Wusheng quickly retreated. His Astral Sword Intent was only at lesser mastery, but it should have been enough for him to deal with Ye Qingtian’s sword intent after being empowered with his saint dao.

“You want to compete with me with the sword? Are you even worthy?” Lin Yun stood with his hands behind him, his hair fluttering, and he looked like a god of death. With a flash, he appeared before Zhao Wusheng so quickly that it was as though he had teleported, before his right hand descended, “Kneel and beg for mercy?”

As the sun and moon revolved in his palm, galaxies flowed from his fingertips, and a divine dragon flew out from his body.

Zhao Wusheng only felt that the entire world had become dark and Lin Yun had become the deity of this world. This made his eyes shrink with his eyes filled with fear. He threw out a mouthful of blood and was down on his knees before he could even figure out what was happening.

“Kowtow and beg for mercy?” Lin Yun said coldly as he slammed Zhao Wusheng’s head on the ground, causing a huge boom as blood flowed from Zhao Wuji’s forehead.

“You like to bully women? Do you like to humiliate others? I’m not worthy of being called a swordsman?” Lin Yun looked like a maniac, with his hair fluttering and murderous intent filled on his face.

“Get off of the Indigo Dragon Path! You’re not worthy!” Lin Yun roared. He grabbed Zhao Wusheng and slammed his palm against the latter’s chest. His attack broke the latter’s ribs, and he died as he fell.

When Lin Yun turned around, he saw Xiao Zhenya and Yuan Hengying approaching him. But facing Lin Yun’s gaze, they were startled and couldn’t help taking a few steps back.

“Ye Qingtian, you want to take it this far for a demoness?” Xiao Zhenya asked.

But Lin Yun didn’t say a word as he walked forth.

“Ye Qingtian, you want to make enemies out of three holy lands for a demoness?” Yuan Hengying gritted his teeth.

“I don’t know any demoness. I only know that she’s my woman, and my sword will take the life of anyone who dares to humiliate her!” Lin Yun drew his sword and dashed forth with his sword ray piercing through the clouds. Ten moves later, Yuan Hengying and Xiao Zhenya fell to the ground, unable to get back up.

Xiao Zhenya was slightly better, while Yuan Hengying had fainted. As he watched Lin Yun approaching, Xiao Zhenya was furious as he coldly said, while coughing up blood, “Ye Qingtian, do you dare to say that out loud? Let everyone hear what you just said!”

“Why wouldn’t I dare?” Lin Yun’s gaze became cold, and he said out loud, “An Liuyan is my woman, and my sword will take the lives of anyone who dares to humiliate her!”

When his voice echoed throughout the nine Dragon Mountains, everyone was shocked by what he said. As everyone turned to look at him, everyone’s jaws nearly dropped to the ground. But shortly after, an uproar broke out.

“Oh my god! Is Ye Qingtian insane? He actually got together with a demoness?”

“Not only that, but he even dares to admit it publicly. He’s a swordsman prodigy of the Heavenly Dao Sect. In the future, which holy land will dare to tolerate him?”

“Ye Qingtian must be insane!”

“He’s insane to give up the champion of the True Dragon Path for a demoness, and he’s just courting death to come to the Indigo Dragon Path.”

As blood splashed, Lin Yun waved his hand and a kick, sending Yuan Hengying and Xiao Zhenya off of the Divine Dragon Path. This scene shocked everyone because Ye Qingtian killed geniuses on the Divine Dragon Elite Ranking as if he was butchering dogs.

“Ye Qingtian is too powerful, killing three elites of the Divine Dragon Elite Ranking in one go!” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Well done! The three of them don’t deserve to be on the Divine Dragon Elite Ranking after bullying a woman. They’re the scum of the holy lands.”

“Ye Qingtian might be called a Holy Maiden Killer, but at least he’s upright. Only someone like him is worthy of being a swordsman!”

“That’s right. So what if she’s from the demonic cult? It’s enough as long as he likes it!” After everyone came to their senses, many cultivators could feel their blood boiling. After all, who hadn’t been arrogant when they were young?
