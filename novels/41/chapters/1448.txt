Chapter 1449 - Hot-Tempered

“Are you certain it’s the Divine Golden Crow Iron?” Jin Xuanyi asked, indifferently staring at Huangfu Yan.

“Do I have a reason to lie to you? I overheard it, and it’s not a secret that many people wanted sect master’s Divine Golden Crow Iron. Many elders were eyeing it, and Elder Chang Yu personally sent it. The Elder Hall is already in chaos,” Huangfu Yan unhappily replied.

“This makes no sense. The sect master is a little too fond of Lin Yun. Not only did he give him the exception to undergo the Saint Pool Baptism, but he even gave him the status as a heaven direct disciple. Now, he even gave Lin Yun the Divine Golden Crow Iron. Not counting the one month he was in the Saint Pool, it has only been ten days since he joined the Sword Sect!”

“How envious. I heard that he’s going to the Great Profound Palace now…”

“Even if he protected the Sword Sect’s prestige, he’s only at the one-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm!”

Jin Xuanyi hadn’t said a word, but everyone else all looked depressed, with envy in their tones. They did look for their peak masters to demand an explanation on the day itself, but they were only told that they could also become a heaven direct disciple if they could stay in the Saint Pool for a month. Although they immediately became quiet, it was undeniable that they were depressed.

“Jin Xuanyi, don’t you have any temper when you’re already at the five-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm?” Huangfu Yan looked at Jin Xuanyi.

But Jin Xuanyi swiftly restored his composure before waving his hand, “I’m in no position to interfere. So why did you come to look for me? Wouldn’t it be better to find someone from the Scarlet Firmament Peak?”

“Senior Brother Jin, what are you saying? The Azure Firmament Peak, Golden Firmament Peak, and Indigo Firmament Peaks have a bad relationship with the Scarlet Firmament Peak, and you’re the leader amongst us. If Huangfu Yan doesn’t come to look for you, who will he look for? Ji Shuxuan? You want us to be a joke in the eyes of the Scarlet Firmament Peak?” An indigo-clothed youth unhappily said as he looked at Jin Xuanyi.

He was Wang Chen of the Indigo Firmament Peak, ranked sixth on the Earth Ranking. He was a prominent figure in the Sword Sect, with his cultivation reaching the four-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm. But he’s still inferior to Jin Xuanyi.

“Just say the word. Are you going to be involved in this matter?” Huangfu Yan unhappily looked at Jin Xuanyi. “If you’re not going to get involved, the hearts of our three peaks will disperse. Not only is the Scarlet Firmament Peak on top of us, but a newcomer of the Divine Firmament Peak is also now on top of us!” Huangfu Yan said in an agitated tone.

Though there were seven peaks in the Sword Sect, the competition was only amongst the four peaks: the Scarlet Firmament Peak, Golden Firmament Peak, Azure Firmament Peak, and Indigo Firmament Peak. The Scarlet Firmament Peak was the strongest amongst the four, which was why the three other peaks had to form a group. As second on the Earth Ranking, Jin Xuanyi naturally became the leader amongst them.

As for the Divine Firmament Peak, there was no representative after Jian Jingtian. So Huangfu Yan had represented them from a certain angle, and they had been holding back for a long time.

A cold light flashed across Jin Xuanyi’s pupils as he raised his eyebrow to look at Huangfu Yan, “How do you want me to get involved? Get someone to teach him a lesson, or I do it myself?”

“Hmph. That’s what I’m planning,” Huangfu Yan replied.

“Hahaha!” Jin Xuanyi sneered. “Go ahead, then.”

“Hmph. Continue to hole up like a tortoise. I’ll bring someone now and teach that god-damned Flower Burial the rules of the Sword Sect!” Huangfu Yan was hot-tempered and looked around, “Who’s coming with me?”

But everyone else coughed when they heard that. They either pretended to look at the scenery or peeked at Jin Xuanyi, but none looked at Huangfu Yan.

“Bunch of cowards. After teaching that brat a lesson, I’ll ask the sect master to demand an explanation. Don’t blame me for not asking you guys to come along at that time!” Huangfu Yan furiously said before he left.

After he left, Wang Chen of the Indigo Firmament Peak said, “Senior Brother Jin, are we going to let Junior Brother Huangfu go just like that? If he’s too harsh and cripples that brat, the sect master will probably cripple him. The sect master is protective, and it’s the same as looking for trouble to make a move against Lin Yun.”

“So what if he’s crippled? His father is a peak master, and his father only has a stupid son like him. So his father would do anything to treat him even if he was crippled. It’s not a bad idea to make a commotion. Even if he can’t become a heaven direct disciple, he should allow us to enter the Great Profound Palace another time.” Jin Xuanyi smiled.

“Senior Brother, what are we going to do? Are we really going to suck it up?” Liu Yu of the Azure Firmament Peak furiously asked.

Jin Xuanyi remained seated with his legs crossed and calmly said, “It’s more reliable to ask people from the Scarlet Firmament Peak for this matter. Do you think they’ll suck it up? Especially Ji Shuxuan, who was ranked first on the Earth Ranking. He has been after the status of a heaven direct disciple for a long time, and he’s definitely the most furious amongst us!”

“Hahaha! As expected, only Brother Jin understands me the best in this massive Sword Sect.” A hearty burst of laughter resounded. Three figures that were like three bright suns were streaking across the horizon before they appeared before them. This immediately made Wang Chen, Liu Yu, and the other Earth Ranking geniuses from the other peaks stand behind Jin Xuanyi with hostility. Both sides fought a lot, so their relationship was like fire and water.

“Interesting… the three geniuses of the Scarlet Firmament Peak actually come to my Golden Firmament Peak?” Jin Xuanyi stood up and looked at Ji Shuxuan with his eyes squinted.

They were ranked first and second on the Earth Ranking and were the only ones in the five-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm. They were known as the Twin Stars of the Earth Ranking. They’ve been competing amongst themselves for a long time. After all, even if Ji Shuxuan was a little stronger, he couldn’t suppress Jin Xuanyi.

But looking at it as a whole, the Scarlet Firmament Peak was firmly above the three other peaks. Aside from Ji Shuxuan, who was first, the Scarlet Firmament Peak had two disciples ranked third and fourth, respectively. Ji Shuxuan outshined them in the Scarlet Firmament Peak, but they were stronger than the likes of Wang Chen and the other geniuses on the Earth Ranking.

When Ji Shuxuan saw the likes of Wang Chen, Liu Yu, and the others looking nervous, he smiled, “Relax. I’m not here to fight today. Brother Jin, you should know why I’m here.”

His words shocked Wang Chen and the others as they exchanged glances. This was because the fight between Ji Shuxuan and Jin Xuanyi was intense; they were like fire and water. Everyone in the Sword Sect knew that they wouldn’t get along, but it appeared that they were going to make peace now. Just because of Lin Yun? This was simply too insane in their eyes.

Ji Shuxuan and Jin Xuanyi exchanged glances before they said together, “Divine Golden Crow Iron!”

When they were done, they were both briefly taken aback before they laughed. They couldn’t stay calm when they heard that the Divine Golden Crow Iron was given to Lin Yun.

As they sat down, Ji Shuxuan let out a breath before he said with resentment in his tone, “I won’t beat around the bush. The sect master is a little too much this time…”

“Stop right there!” Jin Xuanyi quickly stopped Ji Shuxuan. The sect master was Ji Shuxuan’s master, so Ji Shuxuan could be disrespectful. But Jin Xuanyi didn’t dare to badmouth the sect master.

“I really don’t understand. Master is a peak master and also the sect master. He has always been impartial and didn’t give his daughters preferential treatment. But he’s treating Lin Yun even better than a biological son. I pondered about it all night yesterday and still can’t figure it out. After all, I’m his disciple!” Ji Shuxuan complained.

Wang Chen and others could feel the envy in Ji Shuxuan’s tone. When they saw Ji Shuxuan’s depressed expression, they couldn’t help feeling better and inwardly laughed. What Jin Xuanyi said was right; their grievances were nothing compared to Ji Shuxuan.

After all, Ji Shuxuan was the sect master’s disciple, and he was equivalent to half a son of the sect master. He had received all the love and care from the sect master since he was young, but Lin Yun, who suddenly appeared, caused the sect master to make exceptions for him repeatedly.

“You didn’t ask the sect master about it?” Jin Xuanyi asked.

“My senior brother asked about it, but the sect master said Lin Yun suffered grievances while on the Heavenly Path. He told us that we must set an example.”

“Isn’t that the same as telling us not to touch Lin Yun? How can there be such a reason? I can bear it, but my sword can’t!” The two Scarlet Firmament Peak’s disciples said before Ji Shuxuan could reply.

“Let’s not compete amongst ourselves during the Five Peaks Competition two months from now.” Jin Xuanyi smiled.

“It’s easy to talk to a smart person. Since the sect master told us not to make a move against Lin Yun, we can only find a way to deal with him in the tournament. If he can’t make it into the top ten in the competition, then we’ll have an excuse to complain.” Ji Shuxuan replied with a smile.

There was nothing else to say since they had already spoken to this point. Whether it was Jin Xuanyi or Ji Shuxuan, they already had a plan to deal with Lin Yun, which was the Five Peaks Competition!

All other methods were stupid. Whether they get someone to deal with Lin Yun or make a move themselves, it was plain stupid. If that person couldn’t defeat Lin Yun, it would only make them a laughingstock at that time. As for making a move against Lin Yun themselves, they couldn’t. After all, they were geniuses of the Earth Ranking, and the sect master had told them blatantly not to.

Anyone could see how fond the sect master was of Lin Yun, especially after giving him the Divine Golden Crow Iron. Only Huangfu Yan was stupid, unable to see through that. Most importantly, they couldn’t change anything even if they made a move themselves. But it would be different in the Five Peaks Competition. If Lin Yun couldn’t make it into the top ten after receiving so many resources, it would make him a laughingstock.

“Why isn’t Prince Yan here?” Ji Shuxuan couldn’t see Huangfu Yan around and smile, “He shouldn’t be absent.”

Huangfu Yan’s title ‘Prince Yan’ was a sarcastic joke. After all, his father was a peak master, and his grandfather was a saint lord. So he naturally had a unique position in the Sword Sect. But the Sword Sect did not pay any attention to one’s origin but their strength. So that title was naturally a sarcastic joke.

Huangfu Yan also had a straight personality and was hot-tempered. He acted flamboyant in the Sword Sect but didn’t have exceptional strength. This was why many disciples in the Sword Sect were unhappy with him, not to mention that Huangfu Yan was stupid. This was why everyone gave him the title of ‘Prince Yan.’

But aside from Scarlet Firmament Peak’s trio, no one dared to call Huangfu Yan by that title in front of his face.

“He went to the Great Profound Palace.” Liu An said in a strange tone.

Liu An’s words stunned Ji Shuxuan before he loudly laughed, “Hahaha! That’s his style, alright!”VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience
