Chapter 1273 - Shaking the Profound Wither

As time continued to flow, the summit of the snowy mountain became increasingly desolate. This desolation made everyone feel uneasy and even made them wonder if Lin Yun was as strong as he had shown. Could it be that he already suffered heavy injuries and already ran away? There were also people suspicious because the Dragon Blood Fruit should be born by now.

Suddenly, a pillar of light appeared at the summit of the snowy mountain and shot into the sky. What followed after was the crack of heaven as the pillar of light broke through the first layer of heaven with countless starlights scattering down. Not long later, more pillars of light began to appear as the layers of heaven continued to crack. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“T-this is the sign of a saint elixir!”

“That Dragon Blood Fruit is a saint elixir!” Everyone on the island was dumbfounded. At the same time, the terrifying phenomenon shocked the entire Profound Wither Sea and everyone could clearly see the phenomenon caused by it, along with the aura of a saint elixir.

“It’s really a saint elixir!”

“How can it be born there? This makes no sense at all…”

“Weird…” It was rare for saint elixirs to appear on the islands occupied by powerful sects, and the other islands could only give birth to quasi-saint elixirs, at best. There was a huge difference between quasi-saint elixirs and saint elixirs, and the appearance of a saint elixir made all the powerful sects lock their brows together.

There was a rapport between them and they wouldn’t compete with the big sects, allowing them to monopolize quasi-saint elixirs. But the appearance of a saint elixir outside of their territory broke this rapport and none of them could maintain their composure. But in the end, they decided to give up on the saint elixir.

After all, it wasn’t easy to set up the rules, and the Profound Wither Sea would fall into chaos if they went after this saint elixir. At that time, rules would no longer exist and there would be a chaotic battle even before the Profound Wither Island opens up.

No one wanted to see that happening, not to mention that there must definitely be disciples of big sects on that island, so they might not be able to obtain the saint elixir, even if they went.

“Saint elixir!”

“Hahaha! It’s really a success!”

“The Nine Dragon Devouring Array really works!” The elders of the big sects already predicted this scene and couldn’t help being excited.

“That saint elixir definitely belongs to my Azure Thunder Sect! My Azure Thunder Sect’s genius is invincible with the saint sword!”

“Don’t bullshit. The saint elixir will definitely be in the hands of my Myriad Beast Gate. The body-refining technique of my Myriad Beast Gate is invincible!”

“Hahaha! There’s no way you guys can compete with the secret technique of my Flame Phoenix Sect!”

“Don’t forget about my Silverblood Elysium. Who the hell do you guys think you are?”

“We’ll know who has the saint elixir if we go and take a look.” The Dragon Pulse Realm experts from the big sects argued amongst themselves because they were all confident in their own disciples. This was a game between the big sects and the small sects had no say in it.

After all, the big sects have already monopolized the quasi-saint elixirs, and they knew that if they competed with the big sects, they would only end up dead. This made them feel depressed and terrible.

In the end, the Dragon Pulse Realm elders decided to use a secret treasure to see what was going on at the summit of the snowy mountain. From the Myriad Beast Gate’s camp, a silver-haired elder possessing the bloodline of the Wolf Clan took out a cauldron. “Here I go!”

As a light shone from the cauldron, it bolted towards the snowy mountain. At the same time, the Dragon Pulse Realm experts of the other big sects also took out their treasures and shone them at the snowy mountain.

When the light from the cauldron landed on the snowy mountain, the Dragon Pulse Realm elder of the Myriad Beast Gate smiled. “My sect’s Luo Kun has a powerful bloodline and has an invincible physique. Aside from those extraordinary geniuses, no one can compete with him, so he will definitely get his hands on the saint elixir.”

Hearing that, the other elders, deacons, and disciples became excited at the Myriad Beast Gate’s camp. They were all looking at the front as a light screen began to take form. As the scenes on the screen began to clear up, everyone could feel their hearts beating wildly.

After all, it was a saint elixir, and it would be a great boost to their morale when obtaining such a treasure before entering the Profound Wither Island. If a Dragon Pulse Realm elder had an eye on this saint elixir, this meant that they would all be rewarded greatly for it.

“Hurry up! Hurry up!”

“How can the geniuses from the other big sects compare to Senior Brother Luo Kun?” Everyone had anxiety and excitement written on their faces. When the scenes on the light screen finally cleared up, a living hell appeared before them.

The ground was piled with corpses and blood. This scene immediately made all the Myriad Beast Gate’s disciples take in a cold breath because this was a little too brutal. It made no sense for a competition between the big sects to be so brutal.

Suddenly, the corpse of a fatty was found by them. The fatty had bull horns on his head that were sliced into half. At the same time, he had a huge hole on his neck with his corpse all shriveled up. Seeing the corpse of this fatty, everyone could hear a loud rumble in their heads as their faces greatly changed. They couldn’t believe that not only did Luo Kun fail to obtain the saint elixir, but he also lost his life on the snowy mountain and died a terrible death.

This was a resounding slap on the faces of everyone from the Myriad Beast Gate, especially the Dragon Pulse Realm elder. He was completely left dumbfounded by this scene before he let out a roar with his killing aura soaring into the sky, “NOO!”

At the same time, the terrifying aura of a Dragon Pulse Realm expert exploded from him, making everyone within a myriad mile radius tremble in fear.

“What’s going on?”

“The Dragon Pulse Realm elder of the Myriad Beast Gate has gone mad.” Everyone on the surrounding islands were all dumbfounded by this scene.

“No! This is impossible!” Another sharp roar resounded. This time, the elder of the Flame Phoenix Sect flew into a rage because her disciple had died a terrible death at the summit of the snowy mountain. “Who is it?! Who killed my disciple, Qing Ling! I want his life!”

Everyone from the Flame Phoenix Sect was left dumbfounded and couldn’t accept this reality.

“This is impossible, how can the genius of my Azure Thunder Sect die like this? He has the saint sword with him, so how did he die?”

“Who killed the disciple of my Flame Dragon Sect?!”

“Who’s so bold to kill the core disciple of my Silverblood Elysium? Who’s trying to wage war?!” Rage exploded from the big sect camps and the news soon spread out, causing the entire Profound Wither Sea to tremble.

They all heard that a ruthless person had appeared at the summit of the snowy mountain, suppressing and killing the geniuses of the eight big sects.

“H-How is this possible?”

“It’s definitely true. The big sects set up the Nine Dragon Devouring Array, trying to use corpses of other geniuses as nourishment for the Dragon Blood Fruit. But all eight of them were killed.”

“Oh my god. Isn’t that an exaggeration?”

“I’ve personally witnessed it. It’s simply a living hell over there!”

“Who is that person?”

“No idea. We can only see his back figure.” The entire Profound Wither Sea trembled and this scene left everyone in shock. After all, the act of killing the eight geniuses from the big sects was an act of war against them. They began to wonder who was so arrogant as to do that.

“Who is it?!” The eight sects looked at the light screen with sinister expressions. They could only see an azure figure in the light screen sitting in front of the blood pool. But that figure didn’t budge, no matter how much time had passed, nearly causing them to throw up blood. They wanted to take a look at the person who killed their geniuses so that they could kill the genius and destroy the sect that the genius came from. After all, the dignity of the big sects had to be protected, no matter what.

“Brat! Do you dare to turn around?” The elder of the Myriad Beast Gate roared. But since the island was too far away, Lin Yun naturally wasn’t able to hear anything, and the elder was just venting his frustration. Then again, he wasn’t the only one. The other elders also had rage blazing in their pupils.

Suddenly, the azure-clothed swordsman moved. He raised his head and seemed to sense that someone was looking at him. So he slowly turned around and revealed his face to everyone. He was young and didn’t have any fear on his face, not to mention that the purple mark on his forehead was striking.

“Who the hell is that guy?” Everyone who saw Lin Yun was dumbfounded because they couldn’t recognize him. Furthermore, they couldn’t tell where he was from the clothes he wore.

Right at that moment, Lin Yun revealed a devilish smile before he radiated with sword rays, destroying the light screens created by the big sects. This scene made everyone startled because this was a little terrifying.

“Kill him!” A brief moment later, enraged voices resounded from the big sects as one figure after another soared into the sky, heading to the summit of the snowy mountain.
