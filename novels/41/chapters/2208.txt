Chapter 2209 - Heavenly Wheel Pagoda!

Bai Shuying’s face was pale as she smiled while laying in Lin Yun’s embrace. As her aura began to decline, Lin Yun’s mind blew apart. Was he the one that Bai Shuying was waiting for? The person that Bai Shuying always thought about, the person that Bai Shuying went as far as to break her ties with her clan, was him?

Lin Yun was shocked as he once wondered which person won Bai Shuying’s heart. But he never expected that it would be him. Most importantly, he didn’t remember seeing Bai Shuying before or forming an agreement with her. But before he could ask her about it, Bai Shuying fell into a deep slumber with a smile.

“Senior Sister!” Lin Yun exclaimed as he poured his blue dragon aura into her body.

Although Bai Shuying’s face soon became rosy, she showed no signs of awakening.

Lil’ Purple appeared, pushing Lin Yun away, “Let me look at her.”

Lin Yun helped Bai Shuying up and the two examined her condition. Meanwhile, everyone on the plaza was shocked with disbelief. Four Saint Lords, two dead and two crippled. The Azure Scythe Saint Lord and Horizon Hawk Saint Lord would take a long time to recover. When everyone looked at Lin Yun, their gazes became complicated with disbelief.

“This is Flower Burial?” The Dao Yang Holy Son muttered to himself with a grave expression. He could tell that Lin Yun couldn’t be compared to a Saint Lord, regardless of his cultivation or saint dao. Just the Horizon Hawk Saint Lord’s saint energy was enough to give Lin Yun trouble, and not even his Astral Sword Intent could break through those defenses.

Lin Yun was able to achieve all of this thanks to the Sovereign Saint Artifact, the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella. He nearly died and only survived because of Bai Shuying, who helped him turn the tables around and slay the other two Saint Lords.

But thinking about it again, the Dao Yang Holy Son didn’t think he would have the courage to face Saint Lords even if he had a Sovereign Saint Artifact. Not to mention using himself as bait to make the Horizon Hawk Saint Lord and Azure Scythe Saint Lord fall for it.

He recalled what Lin Yun had said earlier; he had slain a Saint Lord before, so why would he be afraid? It was no wonder that Gu Xiyan, the champion of the First Heavenly Path, would hold Lin Yun in such high regard. This was the power of the strongest champion of the Heavenly Paths!

Everyone on the plaza was shocked, but they soon joyfully recovered. Outside the plaza, the Ye Clan and Blood Mon Sect’s Saint Lords looked depressed, with their eyes nearly bulged out.

“H-How is this possible?” The Stun Yang Saint Sovereign asked with a widened mouth, looking like he had eaten a dead fly.

Those from the Blood Moon Sect couldn’t say a word. Aside from the fact that the four Saint Lords were slain, the Solar Divine Rune was injected into Lin Yun’s body, which was more important.

“Things have become out of hand!” The Star Asura King, who was fighting the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint, changed his face when he noticed the situation at the plaza. According to the red-clothed youth’s scheme, it should have been successful, but an incident had happened.

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint was wielding a pseudo-Emperor Sword with the Emperor Sword Array empowering her, and she wasn’t weaker than the two of them. The Saints were injured, and the power of the Emperor Sword Array had dropped, but the Great Saints were supporting it.

Most importantly, the Serene Dust Great Saint was enveloped in a sacred radiance that made her look dignified, and she had been treating the Great Saint’s injuries with her chants. She might seem to be doing it secretly, but the Star Asura King and the red-clothed youth had long noticed this.

“I have to admit that the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciples are all monstrous geniuses.” The red-clothed youth was calmer than the anxious Star Asura King.

“Extracting the Solar Divine Rune isn’t easy, so I bet that lady’s situation isn’t well.” The red-clothed youth noticed that the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint seemed to have a deep relationship with Bai Shuying, so he probed while he fought.

“You don’t have to worry about her. Worry about yourself instead,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint’s Saint Soul said coldly. The moment she finished speaking, she controlled an emperor aura that split space into two, reducing space into spatial fragments.

The spatial fragments were like mirrors as the powerful pressure pulled the red-clothed youth and Star Asura King into the fragments, unable to leave the vortex.

As the world began to spiral for the red-clothed youth and Star Asura King, the two joined forces to withstand the sword rays from the surroundings.

“Congeal!” The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint’s Saint Soul drew a crescent moon with the sword, and all the spatial fragments were restored.

The red-clothed youth and Star Asura King had no room to dodge this attack, so they could only make a move to defend themselves.

As the red-clothed youth and Star Asura King were sent flying from the explosion, they groaned, but space was distorted as they were thrown out. As they retreated, their bodies drew a circle and they appeared behind the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint.

“Cut!” The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint had expected this and swung her sword down. She then drew a circle with her body and multiple afterimages appeared, trapping the red-clothed youth and Star Asura King.

Everything happened too quickly, and the sword ray was too fast. The pseudo-Emperor Sword’s power wasn’t inferior to the red-clothed youth’s emperor aura. But the red-clothed youth and Star Asura King couldn’t gain any advantage from the fight, and had a wound on their bodies instead.FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“I hate the Emperor Sword Array!” The Star Asura King was furious. He had taken a beating from the start to the end. They shouldn’t have confronted it head-on when facing such a heaven-defying array like the Emperor Sword Array, but they had no choice but to hold the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint back because of the red-clothed youth’s plans.

Otherwise, those Saint Lords wouldn't have even made a move before the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint killed them.

“Haha, relax. The fun has yet to come,” the red-clothed youth sensed the Star Asura King’s resentment, so he said with a smile.

“Muyan, you have to make a move now under the sect master’s instructions,” Zhao Tianyu said, looking at Wang Muyan.

Wang Muyan’s gaze was cold, and her eyes had complicated emotions, but they only appeared for a flash. As she became indifferent, she looked like a deity. Her emotions were gone as a golden lotus bloomed in the depths of her eyes, and that ancient power was slowly being unsealed.

With a wave of her hand, the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda rose to the sky, causing heaven and earth to tremble. It didn’t take long before the entire plaza began to tremble and the radiance from the Emperor Sword Array weakened under the suppression of time and space.

The power of time and space quietly invaded the Emperor Sword Array, and exclamations could be heard from the surroundings.

“What’s going on?”

“It’s the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda!”

“The Heavenly Wheel Pagoda has come again!” Those from the Bai Clan, who had experienced it, had their faces change as their voices began to tremble.

“The Heavenly Wheel Pagoda? Isn’t that the treasure of our sect?” The face of the Bai Clan’s ancestor became pale, and he could feel his scalp becoming numb with fear spreading throughout his body. He was a Saint Sovereign, and his heart was filled with despair when he saw the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda again. This was because their previous experience was too miserable.

The Nether Orchid Sword Array was initially fine, but the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda ruined everything. The entire Nether Orchid Courtyard was left in ruins, and the Ye Clan could freely invade them, forcing the Bai Clan into desperation.

“She’s fine for the time being. This is because of her unique physique. This is a type of rare divine physique, and it’s rare even in ancient times,” Lil’ Purple said when she opened her eyes.

“Is this why she needed the Solar Divine Rune? Is there a way to help her” Lin Yun asked.

“I do have a way, but now’s not the time to talk about it,” Lil' Purple said as she raised her head.

Lin Yun also recollected his thoughts and looked at the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda with his brows knitted together. It was too ironic for the treasure of the Heavenly Dao Sect to attack the Emperor Sword Array.

“Empress, which is stronger? A Sovereign Saint Artifact or a time-space treasure?” Lin Yun asked.

“They’re not in the same system. Different Sovereign Saint Artifacts and time-space treasures are also different. Some Sovereign Saint Artifacts are time-space treasures themselves, so I can’t answer because it’s too general,” Lil’ Purple said.

“Let’s be more specific then. Which one is stronger? The Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella or the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda?” Lin Yun asked.

But Lil’ Purple merely looked at Lin Yun and said nothing.

“I got it,” Lin Yun smiled.

“That witch is going to destroy the Heavenly Dao Sect!” On the altar, the Dragon Origin Great Saint was furious, with the other Great Saints frowning.

“Let me deal with it,” the Thousand Plume Great Saint said. They were close to the plaza, managing the operation of the Emperor Sword Array while the Serene Dust Great Saint treated their injuries. She had cultivated a Buddhist secret technique, and the secret treasure in her hand was called the Azure Jade Purification Vase, which could be used to treat the injuries of Saints. It could nourish the Saint Soul, nourish the physique, and temper the saint constellation. It could even regenerate the severed limbs of Saints.

Lin Yun and the four Great Saints fell into contemplation. The four Great Saints have recovered some of their strength, roughly about half. They were secretly preparing to catch the red-clothed youth and Star Asura King by surprise, but they didn’t expect the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda to come.

“It’s the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda…” Ye Guhan sighed. It was a time-space treasure that could infiltrate its energy into the Emperor Sword Array. After all, Time and Space Daos were Eternal Daos.

If the Thousand Plume Great Saint was in his prime, he might be able to block the power of the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda. After all, Wang Muyan couldn’t completely control the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda, so she could only use it once, at best. But the current situation wasn’t optimistic.

“Let me go instead,” the Dragon Origin Great Saint said. “You guys have just recovered from your injuries, and I’m afraid that the Azure Jade Purification Vase will be ineffective if you suffer heavy injuries again.”

The Dragon Origin Great Saint had a powerful physique and was the best candidate to block the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda. But the entire Emperor Sword Array was practically supported by him alone, since his blood was comparable to hundreds of Saint Lords. If he made a move, the power of the Emperor Sword Array would decrease, which was why everyone fell into a dilemma.

As the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda rose higher into the sky, the surrounding phenomenon became even more terrifying, with the power of time and space spreading out, forming multiple terrifying runes. At the same time, the masters of the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda travelled through time as they raised their palms at the bottom of the pagoda.

As more of their palms came into contact with the pagoda, the power released by the pagoda became even more terrifying. When the power was accumulated to the limit, the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda descended at an unimaginable speed.

On the altar, the Dragon Origin Great Saint and Thousand Plume Great Saint were discussing which of them should block the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda, but it was already too late when they raised their heads. Thinking of the consequences after the fall, everyone looked at the pagoda with despair.
