Chapter 2462 - Follow My Heart

Not long after the Empress left, she came to a courtyard in the Profound Imperial Palace. The ground was covered with flowers and towering pavilions. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

In the garden, Su Ziyao was playing the zither by herself. When she raised her head, she could see the Empress appearing.

When the Empress heard the music, she didn’t stop Su Ziyao and poured herself a cup of tea. When the song ended, Su Ziyao then came over to pay her greeting. Since she was brought back to the Divine Dragon Empire, the Empress didn’t make things difficult for her and merely confined her.

“I heard that you’ve prepared the ceremony. Why aren’t you hosting it? Are you waiting for someone?” Su Ziyao asked blatantly.

The Empress nodded, “The Radiant Sword Emperor and Yu Qingfeng would fight in the Skysolute City. All the swordsmen, including the clans who use swords, had all rushed over, making it the biggest gathering of swordsmen in Kunlun Realm.”

“My husband, he will also be going, right?” Su Ziyao muttered with her eyes flickering.

When the Empress heard Su Ziyao addressing Lin Yun as ‘husband,’ she couldn’t help feeling a headache. This was because Su Ziyao would address Lin Yun as ‘husband’ whenever she mentioned her.

“He will. All the swordsmen in Kunlun Realm will be present in the fight. They didn’t just want to see who would win but also to see more of Flower Burial’s grace,” the Empress said mockingly. Her voice sounded like she was sneering, but she also sounded complicated.

“This is normal. After all, he even defeated Tian Xuanzi. Now that his master has succeeded in reaching the Emperor Realm, everyone naturally wants to take a look at him,” Su Ziyao smiled.

The Empress wasn’t furious and replied, “This is why I’m not in a hurry. I’ll host the ceremony after that and wait for him to come. If you all want an outcome, I’ll give him a chance. Based on what you said before you left the Sword Sect, it would be too boring if he wasn’t present at the deification ceremony.”

Su Ziyao’s face changed because she could sense a hint of resentment in the Empress’ tone.

When the Empress stood up, she looked at the garden and said, “I know that you’re unhappy. But have you ever considered who told me about the deification ceremony’s method?”

Su Ziyao’s face changed as she fell into deep thoughts, looking at the Empress.

“The all-mighty saint Southern Emperor that you all speak of!” The Empress said in a self-mocking tone. “Isn’t it ironic? The Southern Emperor thought of this method that would result in countless deaths. But they only feel that the Southern Emperor will give back to Kunlun Realm after he reaches the Deity Realm, and I’m not as generous as him; I won’t sacrifice myself to turn into a deity-grade dragon vein.”

“Would you?” Su Ziyao asked.

“Of course not,” the Empress said as she turned around. Her words were not hesitant, and Su Ziyao wasn’t surprised. After all, she might not have the Southern Emperor’s courage if she was in the Empress’ position.

Seeing how calm Su Ziyao was, the Empress guessed her thoughts and continued, “You and I are alike. So many people of the Golden Dragon’s lineage went to the lesser realm to cultivate their emperor aura, but only you succeeded. Only you grasped the crucial part of the Empress Heart Sutra to follow your heart.”

Su Ziyao pondered briefly, neither denying nor agreeing to that. She knew the Empress came not because she wanted to hear something but to find a listening ear.

The Empress continued, “That person also predicted that I wouldn’t sacrifice myself, which is why he had a backup plan, the Black Emperor. He thinks I don’t know, but I’ve known and played along. But he doesn’t know that I won’t take this lying down.”

Su Ziyao said, “You’re already in the Quasi-Deity Realm, and the fight won’t be fair even if he comes.”

“Su Ziyao, you’re not as confident as you seem. Once you fall for someone, you will have a weakness, even if you’re unwilling to admit to it. Your heart is no longer that cold,” the Empress smiled.

Su Ziyao bit on her lips, but she didn’t deny that. Despite her confidence in the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron, she couldn’t help worrying about it, thinking Lin Yun would come.

“I can give you an answer, but you have to give me a promise,” the Empress said.

“Go on,” Su Ziyao replied.

“Regardless of the outcome, I won’t take his life. I can even admit my loss if he can win me with his sword,” the Empress said. He continued, “This is my answer to you.”

“What about the promise you spoke of?” Su Ziyao asked.

“Regardless of the outcome, you must stay in Kunlun Realm to replace me. This is because the Heavenly Fate Talisman is in his hand, and I believe he will hand it to you as your husband. With the Heavenly Fate Talisman, you can do a better job than me,” the Empress replied.

“Shouldn’t there be a time limit to that?” Su Ziyao asked with her expression easing up.

“No limit. You can leave anytime you want. But believe me, it won’t be your decision to make once you’re in that position,” the Empress said.

Grabbing onto the Empress’ wrist, Su Ziyao looked at her calmly, “If I’m in that position, I can be more heartless than you. After everything ends, I will disband the Divine Dragon Empire.”

“Let me see if you can do it then,” the Empress smiled after a brief stun. After she was done, she left without any hesitation.

Su Ziyao said, “Actually, you won’t harm his life even without my promise, right?”

“That’s for sure. I have only fallen for one person in my life, and I won’t harm the life of someone he chose. If he can defeat me, I can naturally give it up,” the Empress said.

Su Ziyao fell into deep thoughts, looking at the Empress leaving. Now that she looked at it, the Southern Emperor must’ve predicted the Empress’ personality. Regardless of the Empress or Black Emperor, they were backup plans the Southern Emperor left behind.

The Black Emperor was to help, while the Empress was the last guarding the gate. He knew the Empress wouldn’t harm Lin Yun’s life, but she also wouldn’t go easy on him because she couldn’t take it lying down!

In the Western Desert, a woman was donning a grey robe, following behind an old man covered in a cloak and holding a staff. This was the famous Bitter Sea Desert, known as the bitterness of life. But there were many monasteries here, and it was publicly known to head to the Bitter Sea if people wanted to seek opportunities in Buddhism.

This woman was Xin Yan, who found her way here after leaving the Heavenly Dao Sect. The old man was the guide of the legendary Lesser Thunderclap Monastery. They saw many people traveling on their swords, giving off a powerful sword intent. Simultaneously, they were also emitting a Buddhist radiance.

“Who are they? Where are they going?” Xin Yan asked curiously. Because of the harsh environment here, it was dangerous to travel without cultivating a Saint.

“They’re swordsmen of the Heavenly Dragon Monastery. There will be a battle between the Radiant Sword Emperor and Yu Qingfeng. There were also rumors that Flower Burial obtained the Heavenly Dragon Bone, and he would head over to the battle with his master. This is why the swordsmen of Heavenly Dragon Monastery want to look at this Flower Burial,” the old man replied.

“Flower Burial has obtained the Heavenly Dragon Bone?” Xin Yan asked.

“That’s only a rumor, but no one knows if it’s true or fake. No one knew where the news came from; some say it came from the Black-White Sacred Palace, while some say it came from the Profound Imperial Palace. Then again, some said that it was fake. No one knew if it was true, but they knew that Flower Burial would be present in the battle between his master and Yu Qingfeng,” the old man explained.

Ripples fluctuated in Xin Yan’s heart, and she muttered, “Flower Burial is already that powerful?”

“Not long ago, Tian Xuanzi was known to be the strongest beneath the Emperor Realm. No matter what, Flower Burial was someone who killed him. No one knew if he was that strong, but it was unquestionable that he qualified to become the strongest swordsman,” the old man replied.

A smile rose on Xin Yan’s lips when she heard that. She couldn’t imagine that the young lad she led into the Firmament Sword Pavilion in the past would reach this step. She said, “Senior, I wish to go and take a look.”

“Your Buddhist fortune has come, and you will head beyond the Kunlun Realm. So why...” the old monk asked.

“I practice Buddhism, but that doesn’t mean that I’ve given up all my emotions. Instead, I follow my heart,” Xin Yan replied.

“Flower Burial is an acquaintance of yours,” the old monk asked.

“Not an acquaintance. He’s my younger brother, and I want to see how he is doing now,” Xin Yan smiled.

The old monk pondered long before smiling, “Perhaps this is why you can receive Buddhist fortune. Go on, and come back quickly. Follow your heart.”

“Thank you, senior.” Xin Yan clasped her hands together and soared to the sky, chasing after the swordsmen of the Heavenly Dragon Monastery.

In the Heavenly Dao Sect, the Thousand Plume Great Saint brought Dao Yang Holy Son, and Bai Shuying with him, heading to the Skysolute City. He said, “We’re going to Skysolute City to back Lin Yun up. It has also been some time since the two of you last saw him.”

“Master, is he going to become the strongest swordsman this time,” Dao Yang Holy Son asked with Bai Shuying also turning to look at the Thousand Plume Great Saint curiously.

The Thousand Plume Great Saint smiled, “It doesn’t matter if he’s willing, but he’s already placed on that spot forcibly. Do you understand it now? Since he’s on that spot, he doesn’t have a choice.”
