Chapter 1271 - Saint Dragon Blooded Fruit

When forty-nine demonic astral flowers appeared around Lin Yun, the flowers lit up with stars shining brightly, as if it was daytime on the entire island. But his words had left all the Empyreans on the island dumbfounded.

They had seen the previous terrifying phenomenon at the summit of the snowy mountain and even saw the fight between Lin Yun and the eight experts. But they were too far away, so they could only see a blurred figure. But when they heard Lin Yun’s voice, they finally recovered from their shock.

They realized that not only was Lin Yun still alive, he even wanted to compete for the Dragon Blood Fruit and claimed that no one could leave. Did this mean that he wanted to slaughter the eight experts? At this moment, everyone was shocked by Lin Yun’s boldness.

“She’s dead?” The seven experts on the snowy mountain were shocked, looking at the armored woman’s headless corpse, and their minds went blank. They couldn’t imagine that the armored woman who nearly killed Lin Yun earlier suddenly died.

Right at this moment, Lin Yun let out a roar as bright golden light shone from his body. At this moment, he had finally activated the origin saint rune within his Azure Dragon Mark. These people were too strong, and each of them was comparable to those ranked at the top one-thousands of the Empyrean Ranking.

He didn’t hold back and circulated the Azure Dragon Saint Art to suppress these people. When the blood flames merged with the azure dragon aura, an ancient aura spread out from Lin Yun. He was shining so brightly that he was like a sun enveloping the summit of the snowy mountain.

“Origin saint rune!”

“That guy actually grasped an origin saint rune!” The seven geniuses realized that they had underestimated Lin Yun. They initially wanted to suppress him quickly, but were horrified to discover that it was tough for them to escape now.

While being accompanied by an azure dragon’s roar, the sky turned red with immense pressure crashing down on the seven geniuses. Right at this moment, one of them roared, “We can’t hold back anymore or all of us might lose our lives here!”

Enveloped in purple-golden light, Lin Yun pushed the saint rune within the Azure Dragon Mark to the limit before he charged over.

“This person’s origin isn’t that simple. Everyone has to be careful because I can practically be sure that he’s definitely not a nameless person.” The purple-clothed man said with a grave expression.

“Who the hell are you?! You’re definitely not someone from the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect!” They yelled, thinking that Lin Yun was really shameless to hide his identity on purpose.

“Me? I’m just an ant in the eyes of you disciples from big sects. So, why ask?” Lin Yun snorted and waved his hand, sending the silver-haired man flying and spewing blood.

“I’ll go all out with you!” Luo Kun roared with his eyes turning red as he entered his demonized form. His body immediately swelled up with two bull horns growing out from his forehead. His skin also turned black like metal and emitted a bizarre luster that was filled with an ancient aura. He was like a mountain just by standing there. When he stomped his foot on the ground, the sheer force from his stomp caused the surrounding air to tremble. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Your body-refining technique is interesting. If you’re willing to hand it over, I can consider sparing your life,” said Lin Yun.

“You’re courting death!” The fatty let out a roar before throwing a punch at Lin Yun’s chest.

His punch shattered a lot of dragon runes on his body, causing the corner of Lin Yun’s lips to twitch. Luo Kun’s body-refining technique was strong, and the dragon runes were ignited. But even so, many of the runes still shattered under this attack.

“Since you’re unwilling to hand it over, then you can go and die!” Lin Yun roared as light converged into his fist before taking the form of a dragon’s head while emitting an ancient pressure that belonged to a saint rune.

“Die!” But just when Lin Yun threw his punch out, the others destroyed some of the demonic astral flowers and charged over. The silver-haired man from the Silverblood Elysium’s attacks were bizarre and his blood was silver. Furthermore, he also had a terrifying physique and could withstand the explosion of the demonic astral flowers. This was also the reason why he could charge over so quickly, even after he was sent flying away.

Just like that, he and Luo Kun managed to sandwich Lin Yun in their attacks. This meant that Lin Yun would have to take an attack head-on regardless of who he faced. In the end, Lin Yun could only forcibly bear an attack and was sent flying back. When he was in mid-air, his figure blurred and avoided a sword ray that was enveloped in flames and lightning.

“Impressive, it’s no wonder why you guys can make so many people into nourishment for the Dragon Blood Fruit. Looks like I’ve underestimated you guys.” Lin Yun said before unleashing his sky sword intent at complete mastery. When his sword intent merged with his azure dragon aura, it formed into an azure dragon sword aura.

He was enveloped in light with his black hair fluttering in the wind, looking like a fiend who came from hell. At this moment, the Lin Yun back from the Heavenly Path who only needed one sword to kill was back. Using his fingers as a sword, Lin Yun charged toward Luo Kun.

“Quick, stop him!” Everyone was terrified. As a disciple of the Myriad Beast Gate, Luo Kun was the only one capable of fending Lin Yun off. But this meant that he would also have to bear the immense pressure from Lin Yun. Without Luo Kun around, they were no different from lambs before Lin Yun.

When the azure dragon sword aura was formed, Lin Yun’s aura reached a terrifying height. He then let out a roar to send them back. But Luo Kun had gone insane, exhausting his vitality as he tried his best to stop Lin Yun.

He was enveloped in demonic miasma, looking like an ancient demon who came back to life. But it was a pity that he ran into Lin Yun, who could suppress him with his physique alone. Now that Lin Yun brought out his sword aura, how could he possibly stop Lin Yun? Just a brief moment later, he was already covered in wounds. As a sword ray flashed, the bull horns on his head were severed into two.

“No!” This made Luo Kun scream out with his aura dropping. But Lin Yun didn’t let this opportunity go and swiped his fingers with a killing aura brewing in his pupils. This made Luo Kun let out an even sharper scream as a hole appeared on his neck. There was nothing he could do, he could only watch his blood flow as he collapsed towards the ground. When he fell onto the ground, the entire snowy mountain was forced to shake.

The silver-haired man’s eyes shone with a devilish light as he silently approached Lin Yun. His arms had turned into a pair of sharp blades that wanted to backstab Lin Yun. But when his attack landed on him, they only caused sparks to fly and that was it.

Numerous dragon runes broke, but he failed to injure Lin Yun. When Lin Yun turned around, he raised his hand and pushed his palm forth.

The silver-haired man wanted to retreat, but when Lin Yun’s hand enveloped him, he was forcibly dragged over. After activating the Azure Dragon Grasp, a dazzling light shone from Lin Yun with a thunderstorm forming in his palm.

When the silver-haired man took the attack on his head, blood dripped from the corner of his lips and he lifelessly fell to the ground. That was the Azure Dragon Grasp, a secret technique from the Azure Dragon Lord that contained the profundities of thunderstorms.

As the wind blew, the remaining three charged over with their constellations behind them. They knew that they had no choice but to attack. Either Lin Yun dies or they would die, so they didn’t hold back and unleashed their trump cards on Lin Yun.

When Lin Yun raised his head, a colossal azure dragon appeared behind him. As the azure dragon basked in purple-golden light, it looked vivid, especially its eyes, which were filled with sky sword intent. Spreading his arms apart, Lin Yun soared into the sky and charged forth.

This instantly dissolved the attacks from the remaining three geniuses. When Lin Yun charged over, he was like a bright sun as one corpse after another fell to the ground. Very quickly, there was only one person left, it was the purple-clothed youth from the Azure Thunder Sect.

It wasn’t because he was invincible that he could survive till now. The fatty was the strongest amongst the eight, with the silver-haired man being second. The reason why he could survive till now was that he had high attainment in the sword, and he backed off when he sensed Lin Yun’s sword aura, allowing him to be the last man standing.

“You’re very strong.” The purple-clothed man looked at Lin Yun and coldly said, “But Dugu Yan of my Azure Thunder Sect is invincible in the sword. The moment you enter the Profound Wither Island, you’ll definitely die.”

When he was done, he threw out a mouthful of blood on his sword, causing his sword to shine brightly. The light was dazzling and even made Lin Yun feel a stinging pain in his eyes. When his vision recovered, the purple-clothed man already had a bizarre array forming around him, seemingly trying to teleport him elsewhere.

But Lin Yun’s face became cold and he wanted to use his divine firmament sword intent to restrict the purple-clothed man. “I’ve already said that none of you can escape!”

All of a sudden, the array enveloping the summit exploded as demonic vines shot out from the ground. The vines were covered with spikes and instantly dragged the purple-clothed man, who was trying to escape, back.

At the same time, Zhao Yan and Gongsun Yan, who were both hiding in the dark, were also restrained by the demonic vines.

Lin Yun waved his hand to severe the demonic vines. When he turned around, he noticed that the blood pool was emitting a sacred and bizarre aura, and all the corpses were turned into nourishment for the Dragon Blood Fruit. At this moment, he finally realized that the quasi-saint elixir was about to be promoted to a saint elixir!
