Chapter 1089 - Joining The Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect

Feng Jue was surprised by Lin Yun’s composure because others would have lost their mind by now. After all, every genius had their own arrogance, and they might feel that they were underestimated by the Sword Sect. So Feng Jue was also prepared to deal with that, but Lin Yun’s composure made him feel somewhat uncomfortable.

“What’s the matter?” Lin Yun smiled.

Seeing that Lin Yun wasn’t giving him any reason to flare up, Feng Jue could only smile, “It’s nothing. There are two reasons. One was to ensure your safety because the Eastern Desolation is far from the Ancient Barren Domain. The Profound Sky Sect won’t be able to reach this place. Furthermore, I bet they also didn’t think that I would bring you here instead of the Sword Sect. It’s troublesome that you killed five Realm Sons. Although the Sword Sect isn’t afraid of them, we can’t possibly defend against them all the time.”

Lin Yun nodded his head because it made sense. Before coming to Kunlun Realm, he already knew that the ten Realm Sons came from saint clans. Although the seniors in their clans wouldn’t act personally, it wouldn’t be a problem for them to dispatch geniuses of the same generation to suppress Lin Yun.

“The other Realm Sons are alright, but the Nether Divinity Realm Son is somewhat more troublesome. His grandfather is a Grand Elder in the Profound Sky Sect, and Elder Jin Jue was a dog of his. Do you get my drift?” Although Feng Jue wasn’t direct with his words, Lin Yun still understood what he was trying to say.

He couldn’t even deal with a dog like Elder Jin Jue, not to mention the Nether Divinity Realm Son’s grandfather.

Feng Jue paused briefly before he continued, “But you don’t have to care about that dog and that old bastard. Our master and I will deal with them for you. Now, the second reason was for you to train yourself. You can sense that the law here isn’t like the Profound Amber Realm, right? Why don’t you tell me about it?”

He was testing Lin Yun on purpose right now as he smiled.

Lin Yun pondered before he replied, “I can’t describe it clearly, but I can sense that the law here is a lot more complete. This place seems to be filled with dao like a boundless ocean unlike the Profound Amber Realm. It seems like the sword dao is a lot grander here. Even the other martial intents are more profound in my eyes.”

Everything was still the same, but at the same time, things were different. Even after a few days, Lin Yun couldn’t adjust to Kunlun Realm. Fortunately, he could circulate his origin energy normally now. When he initially arrived in Kunlun Realm, the origin energy in his aura oceans were frozen and broken into pieces. Meaning, he couldn’t do anything aside from rely on his physical strength.

“That’s right.” Feng Jue paused briefly before he continued, “You’ll need at least six months to get used to it here. Consider this a test for you to become familiar with the law in Kunlun Realm.”

“Can’t I do it in the Sword Sect?” Lin Yun wasn’t grumbling, but he was just baffled by the process.

“You’re pretty smart. Most geniuses will go into seclusion for roughly a year in the powerful sects after arriving in Kunlun Realm. But they can’t go anywhere in that year aside from getting familiar with the law here,” said Feng Jue. “Maybe you can’t imagine it, but people in Kunlun Realm reach the Xiantian Realm at birth. Then, the Profound Martial Realm at the age of three. When they turn ten, they reach the Violet Palace Realm. If they can’t reach the Heavenly Soul Realm before the age of fifteen, they practically have no talent in cultivating.”

Lin Yun couldn’t believe what he was hearing. If they couldn’t reach the Heavenly Soul Realm at the age of fifteen, they would have no talent in cultivation? When he thought about his past, he remembered that he barely hit the Xiantian Realm at the age of fifteen. No wonder Kunlun Realm was a bigger world. Just being at Xiantian Realm since birth was shocking enough.

“The gap is really huge.” Lin Yun muttered. He now understood why he had to stay here for a year. The Sword Sect was a transcendent sect with lots of geniuses. Even those his age would probably have reached the Empyrean Realm or even higher. There was naturally no way for him to cultivate with them, so he had to catch up to their cultivation level.

“It has nothing to do with the people. It’s the environment. The dao in the lower realms is incomplete, so you can’t excavate your full potential there. But those who reach Kunlun Realm will experience a great boost in their cultivation within a year. Their potential will be excavated during that time, so they will see many changes. It’s even better for you since you’re the champion. You’ll catch up to them in no time,” smiled Feng Jue.

“The Empyrean Realm is a threshold that most people will reach before the age of twenty. The reason why our master didn’t want you to go into seclusion in the Sword Sect is because of the Nine-Leaf Saint Fruit. The next year will be extremely important for you and he doesn’t want you to waste the year,” said Feng Jue while they headed towards the island ahead of them.

Lin Yun instantly understood what was going on when he heard Feng Jue’s explanation. Aside from his safety, their master wanted him to train himself for the next year rather than going into seclusion.

“Furthermore, don’t underestimate the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. It’s an external force of the Sword Sect, and the core disciples are in the Empyrean Realm. I feel that there’s no need for you to go to Sword Sect if you can’t catch up to them within a year,” smiled Feng Jue, clearly wanting to suppress Lin Yun’s arrogance.

Lin Yun knew that Feng Jue wanted to test him. If the Sword Sect was only going to accept him as a disciple, there was no need for them to go through so much trouble. It seemed like they were placing great importance on him instead.

“Senior Brother is right, if I can’t catch up to the core disciples in a year, there’s no need for me to head to Sword Sect,” said Lin Yun without any fear.

“Then you have to be careful. The Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect has quotas to enter Sword Sect every year for geniuses who aren’t any weaker than you. It will be a problem if you can’t catch up to them,” smiled Feng Jue.

“Is that so?” Lin Yun smiled.

Feng Jue smiled and maintained his silence. Even he felt that it was impossible for Lin Yun to catch up to the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s disciples within one year. So Feng Jue wouldn’t be prepared for the turbulence that Lin Yun would cause in the next year.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Lin Yun looked at the massive island up ahead and said, “It doesn’t seem far. I guess I can’t tell how big it is until we get there.”

“The Eastern Desolation is huge. Even the Ancient Barren Domain, which is the core of the Eastern Desolation, only occupies three-tenths of the Eastern Desolation,” said Feng Jue. Since the Profound Azure Manor was located to the far east of the Eastern Desolation, it bordered the water.

In the Profound Azure Manor, there were countless sects whose positions were higher than the mortal forces. In everyone’s eyes, there were four sects in particular who were considered the strongest. The Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect was formed based on the sword, the King Suspend Palace had the deepest foundation, the Buddhist Azure Thunder Monastery, and the mysterious Thousand Crane Pavilion. The other sects were demonic forces.

The conflict between the sects never rested, with the conflict between the four sects being the most intense. At the same time, there were many newly risen forces who were vying for the position of the strongest sect. Listening to Feng Jue’s explanation, Lin Yun had a rough impression of the current situation.

He was basically in the countryside of the Eastern Desolation. It was the intersection between the land and the ocean. So the Profound Azure Manor was never calm.

There were lots of islands in the ocean region controlled by the Profound Azure Manor while the southwest region was enveloped in a mist throughout the year. The territory of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, also known as the Fleeting Cloud Sea, was full of islands. Each island, aside from the main island, was considered a subsidiary force of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect.

“Many people get attacked here, even under the watch of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. Then again, you’ll need to watch out as well since it’s too far for the Sword Sect to help you,” said Feng Jue while he descended onto the island with Lin Yun.

Fleeting Cloud Island, where the sect was located, was the size of a continent. The Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect was situated on the far north of the island with hundreds of mountains disappearing into the clouds. Lin Yun saw countless buildings and people everywhere he looked.

Then, he spotted a mountain enveloped in silver radiance. It had boundless spiritual energy that was denser than anywhere in the Heavenly Path. But what shocked Lin Yun was the boundless sword intent pouring down from the sky like a waterfall. He had never seen such a sight before.

“That’s the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s Sword Saint Mountain. Even elders aren’t allowed to cultivate there. It’s reserved for the best of the best core disciples,” said Feng Jue.

If Lin Yun could cultivate there, his attainment in the sword path would definitely soar. He had seen many places in the Heavenly Path with dense spiritual energy, but he had never seen a place related to swords.

“The Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect has 100 core disciples, who are the most elite of the elite. All of them are at least in the Empyrean Realm. Additionally, there are 3,000 inner disciples and 10,000 outer disciples. Even the weakest outer disciple is in the fifth soul Heavenly Soul Realm while the inner disciples are at least in the seventh soul Heavenly Soul Realm.”

Feng Jue seemed prideful when he introduced Lin Yun to everything. It was only an external force of the Sword Sect, but it made Lin Yun realize that his cultivation meant nothing.

“Let’s go!” When Feng Jue was done speaking, he took off with Lin Yun. Immediately, they appeared in front of a barrier made with sword intent. It appeared that Senior Brother Feng Jue said was right. Even though the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect was an external force, it couldn’t be underestimated.

“This array is created with tens of thousands of saint runes with a saint sword in the core to empower it. To anyone but our master, it’s basically death,” said Feng Jue as he took out a token to open a passage in the barrier. When they entered the barrier, Lin Yun could sense the dense spiritual energy, and that the territory was a lot bigger inside the array.

“Greetings, Senior Feng Jue. The Sect Master has informed us to wait here for you.” While Lin Yun exclaimed at the environment, a few people led by a purple-clothed lady appeared before them. The lady was gorgeous, but her cold expression made her look aloof.

“It’s been a few years. It looks like you’ve been cultivating well,” smiled Feng Jue. “Lass Ye, this is a disciple that I picked in the Heavenly Path. Get him a place to stay, I’ll pay your Sect Master a visit personally.”

When the group heard that Lin Yun was from the Heavenly Path, they couldn’t help feeling shocked because this was a pretty rare occurrence.
