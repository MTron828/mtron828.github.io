Chapter 1670 – I Have To Go

Lin Yun briefly pondered before he opened the pouch before Lil’ Purple and took the item that was in it out. It was a crystal rock the size of a fist. Aside from that, there was also a jade slip.

After looking at this rock, Lin Yun poured a wisp of his sword intent into it. The next moment, the rock shone, and a person gradually appeared. This person was naturally the Radiant Sword Saint.

“Master!” Lin Yun rejoiced.

But the Radiant Sword Saint reacted as if he didn’t see Lin Yun and smiled, “When you open this pouch, this means that you didn’t die in the Ancient Barren Battlefield and have left. I am only a recording, and I know you have many questions. But listen to what I have to say, first.”

A recording? Lin Yun soon figured out that his master probably left a memory in this crystal rock. Did his master know he would be in danger in the Ancient Barren Battlefield?

“Don’t be surprised. I have already speculated that you’d run into danger in the Ancient Barren Battlefield. With Tian Xuanzi’s personality, he won’t watch as you become stronger. Furthermore, this will also be a great opportunity for him to probe my current condition. Perhaps I have already died when you see this memory.”

“Master, you didn’t die.” Lin Yun said, but he soon realized this was just a memory of his master. But it was just as what his master had speculated.

If Yu Qingfeng didn’t show up and Lin Yun didn’t have the Firmament Saint Cloth, he would have died. His master appeared on the Ancient Barren Battlefield, despite knowing he would die. Thinking about this, Lin Yun couldn’t help feeling sour in his nose.

“If I somehow lived, that person probably showed up.” The Radiant Sword Saint smiled, but his smile was complicated. He softly sighed, “That is a good person. The reason why I’m not able to make that step out is also because of that sword three thousand years ago.

“People think I’m incapable of making that step, but how can a Saint take that step out when he experienced that legendary era? Even if I’m a Sword Saint. Without experiencing what happened three thousand years ago, I would’ve long become an Emperor. But it doesn’t matter because the moment I make that step, it’ll mean that I will possess the ability to break legends!” The Radiant Sword Saint’s eyes shone brightly when he said that.

At this moment, Lin Yun finally knew that the reason why his master couldn’t make that step to reach the Emperor Realm was because of Sword Emperor Yu Qingfeng. The sword from three thousand years ago should be the sword that Yu Qingfeng used to slice off two of the Sword Sect’s peaks.

“Things are somewhat complicated with Tian Xuanzi. The power struggle in the Ancient Barren Domain has the shadows of the Divine Dragon Empire behind it, and this matter is related to the Nine Emperors. It cannot be explained in a few words. Remember, don’t return to the Ancient Barren Domain before becoming a Saint. If I can’t become an Emperor, then never come back.” The Radiant Sword Saint said. When he recorded this message, he didn’t know Lin Yun had the Firmament Saint Cloth. He would’ve told Lin Yun to never return if he knew.

Even if the Radiant Sword Saint didn’t tell him that, Lin Yun could already sense that there was a more significant force behind Tian Xuanzi. If it weren’t for Yu Qingfeng’s existence, it wouldn’t be that troublesome to eradicate the Sword Sect. After all, there was no way the Sword Sect could confront such a giant, and there was a high possibility that the giant was the Divine Dragon Empire!

The Nine Emperors appeared three thousand years ago and re-established the Divine Dragon Empire, uniting the Kunlun Realm. Under the leadership of the Divine Dragon Empire, the Kunlun Realm has reached an unprecedented height of prosperity and even showed signs of restoring the Kunlun Realm to what it was in ancient times.

For example, the Divine Dragon Era was much stronger three thousand years ago. But because of how massive the Divine Dragon Empire was, it was unavoidable for there to be a power struggle within. So becoming Tian Xuanzi’s enemy might not equate to facing the entire Divine Dragon Empire.

The Divine Dragon Empire didn’t dare to touch the Sword Sect, which was definitely because of Yu Qingfeng. This was because the entire Ancient Barren Domain was under the Divine Dragon Empire, in name, and the Sword Sect was under the jurisdiction of the empire.

If the Sword Sect could become a holy land and the Radiant Sword Saint could grow to the Nine Emperors’ height, the Divine Dragon Empire might no longer support Tian Xuanzi. In the end, this was a world where the strong preyed on the weak.

“I have never taught you any sword technique before the Dragon Pulse Realm, and it has nearly been two years since you joined the Sword Sect.” The Radiant Sword Saint said. “I will now teach you a sword technique. This sword technique has a high requirement, and your Divine Firmament Sword Sutra needs to reach complete mastery. Furthermore, you have to reach the Nirvana Stage to barely practice it. Not only does it have a high requirement, but only a few can successfully learn it. This sword technique is called the Divine Firefly Sword.”

“The Divine Firefly Sword?” Lil’ Purple exclaimed by the side.

“Have you heard of this sword technique?” Lin Yun asked.

“I restored some memories during my trip to the Myriad Demon Peak. The Sword Ancestor should have created the Divine Firefly Sword, and the Sword Ancestor is the ancestor of the Jian Clan. He was one of the few in ancient times who could compete with the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity.” Lil’ Purple nodded her head. “The Sword Ancestor created this sword technique, but he didn’t hide it and shared it with all the holy lands that produced swordsmen. This sword technique was famous in the Kunlun Realm back then, and even Iris had practiced it. This sword technique has thirteen swords, each equivalent to a sword technique. It has a high threshold, and only those with a strong passion for the sword can successfully practice it.” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

When he heard Lil’ Purple’s explanation, Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts. He briefly pondered before saying, "The fireflies' light can also compete with sunlight and moonlight?”

“You’re smart. This is the meaning behind this sword technique. The Sword Ancestor was a prideful person, and your master probably has a connection with the Jian Clan, since he possessed this sword technique.” Lil’ Purple smiled.

Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts because his master’s real name was Jian Wuming. He once asked his master about it, but his master didn’t say much. So he guessed that there must be a story in this matter.

“The sword technique is recorded in that jade slip. You might be an unprecedented genius regarding the sword, but don’t neglect your cultivation. I wouldn't have given you this sword technique if you didn’t grasp the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent.” The Radiant Sword Saint said.

According to what his master said, despite not reaching the threshold to practice this sword technique, he had grasped the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent. So he could give it a try. He had to take it slow, or it would be dangerous.

As the Radiant Sword Saint sighed, he said, “I’m trapped in my abode, and I can’t teach you. Otherwise, you would’ve made more progress in the past two years, and I’m sorry about that.”

Hearing that, Lin Yun became anxious and wanted to refute his master.

The Radiant Sword Saint probably guessed that Lin Yun would disagree with that, and he smiled, “I took in a total of five disciples before you. You still have an eldest senior brother and a second senior sister. Your second senior sister is rebellious, and had I expelled her from the sect. I have no idea where she went over the years.

“Your eldest senior brother is a Saint, and his name is Qing He. He has an amiable personality, and he followed me the longest. I taught him everything I knew before letting him join the Heavenly Dao Sect. He should now be a Saint Elder in the Heavenly Dao Sect. When you reach the Heavenly Dao Sect, you can crush this crystal rock, and your eldest senior brother will come to see you.

“You don’t need to have any concerns because he will protect you, and the Heavenly Dao Sect can also ensure your safety. He will teach you on my behalf, regardless of the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra or the Great Profound Sword Canon. Remember, Tian Xuanzi won’t be able to do anything to you as long as you reach the Heavenly Dao Sect. So take care of yourself, my disciple.”

As Radiant Sword Saint’s figure gradually dissipated, Lin Yun looked at the crystal rock in his hand and felt that he had a heavy heart. It turned out that his master had already prepared everything.

Looking at this scene, even Lil’ Purple couldn’t help sighing because the Radiant Sword Saint was respectful. She had nothing to pick about the Radiant Sword Saint, even if she was a petty person. The latter knew about Tian Xuanzi’s schemes, but he still left his abode to protect Lin Yun and even arranged everything for him.

“What do you plan to do now?” Lil’ Purple asked, looking at Lin Yun.

“I have to make a trip to the Heavenly Dao Sect to learn the Great Profound Sword Canon and try to perfect it. But before that, I plan to make a trip to the Heaven Domain’s Unholy Sea and check out the current situation of the Azure Dragon’s lineage.” Lin Yun made up his mind after a brief consideration. He knew that it would be troublesome for him to head to the Heaven Domain’s Unholy Sea after going to the Heavenly Dao Sect, so he had to take this opportunity and make a trip there.

“Okay.” Lil’ Purple nodded before she said, “I probably won’t be going with you.”

Lin Yun was baffled when he heard that.

Seeing this, Lil’ Purple explained, “I obtained a few droplets of the Phoenix’s blood in my trip to the Myriad Demon Peak, and I have to find a way to obtain more. That place also has clues of the other Sovereign Divine Runes. If I wasn’t worried for you, I wouldn’t have left that place so quickly.”

“Do you have to be in such a hurry? I can go there with you in the future.” Lin Yun smiled. But it was mainly because the Myriad Demon Peak was dangerous and a forbidden zone for Saints. It was fortunate that she could come out alive, and he didn’t want to see Lil’ Purple risking her life.

“I have a reason that I must go there. As long as I gather all the Sovereign Divine Runes, I can find out the secrets about the sword that should be kept in Iris’s sword box. My memories have nothing about it, but I can sense that it should be an important sword. Moreover, I have a speculation…” Lil’ Purple shook her head.

“What speculation?” Lin Yun asked.

“Remember when I told you that this sword box was empty when Iris was carrying it back then?” Lil’ Purple asked.

“Yes, so?”

“I guessed it should be the ‘broken sword’ in your body!” Lil’ Purple gave a shocking speculation.

This made Lin Yun briefly stunned before his face drastically changed. The sword within his body wasn’t exactly broken, but only so much was revealed so far. In the past, a shackle would break whenever he made a breakthrough in his sword intent. But after he created his Sovereign Constellation, that sword calmed down. Perhaps that sword would only react when he summons his complete Sovereign Constellation.

But if the sword in his body was the one that should be kept in the sword box, it would be a little too shocking.

“I met the Iris Sword Saint in the past, but he couldn’t recognize that sword…” Lin Yun said.

“How do you know that he’s not lying to you? Or he might not have seen that sword in your body. He’s not exactly a good person.” Lil’ Purple said. The Iris Sword Saint had sealed her for a hundred thousand years, so she was naturally unhappy with him.

“But this is only a speculation. Let me have the sword box, and I can definitely walk further this time. After that, I’ll meet up with you in the Heavenly Dao Sect.” Lil’ Purple revealed her plan.

“I don’t mind letting you borrow the sword box, but do you really have to go?” Lin Yun’s pupils flashed with concern.

“I have to go, no matter what.” Lil’ Purple looked at Lin Yun with her eyes filled with determination. She was still too weak and felt tremendous pressure whenever she could only watch as Lin Yun put himself in danger.
