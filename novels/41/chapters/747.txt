Chapter 748 - Tempering Sword, Heart, and Qi!

Countless cultivators clashed with the demonic beasts as origin energy and demonic aura exploded into the sky, dying it red. The corpses of demonic beasts and human cultivators littered the ground.

Aside from those who came for the life-and-death experience, there were also those who fought for humanity because the commoners of Swordmire City were just behind them. If the city broke through, those commoners would face a crisis and turn into a sea of bones.

The battlefield was chaotic, but there was organization to it if one observed carefully. The furthest away were the Heavenly Soul Realm experts along with geniuses like Wu Xiaotian and Qin Yang who were dealing with the overlord quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beasts. The commotion they caused was the most terrifying and the shockwave itself was enough to kill Violet Palace Realm geniuses.

Behind them were the likes of Lin Yun and Ji Wuye who were dealing with the ordinary quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beasts. Further behind them were the ordinary geniuses who were dealing with the Yin-Yang stage demonic beasts.

Finally, Swordmire City’s army was directly under the city walls fighting with the Profound Martial Realm demonic beasts. Their job wasn’t easy because the sheer number of Profound Martial Realm demonic beasts outnumbered all other fields. There were at least a hundred thousand demonic beasts.

Just like that, the four battlefields were clearly differentiated. The most dazzling ones were definitely monstrous geniuses like Wu Xiaotian. But they were too far away, so they could only see the fights of Lin Yun and Ji Wuye. Aside from young geniuses, there were also sect’s elders, wandering cultivators, and demonic cultivators who were fighting.

People like them hardly gathered at the same place, not to mention working together. But due to various reasons, they had no choice but to work together. After all, demonic cultivators definitely had a bounty on them and the competition between sects was also ferocious. Even geniuses like Lin Yun and Ji Wuye have a personal grudge between them, not to mention others.

When Lin Yun drew his sword, he wasn’t like other geniuses who were fighting for reputation. His heart was calm as he treated this beast tide as training to temper his sword, heart, and qi.

Heavenly Shatter Cloud!

There were too many demonic beasts and his movements were highly restricted. This was why Lin Yun had no choice but to use the strongest move of the Aquaselenic Sword. Nine silver origin wisps manifested into a storm of sword intent that tore the demonic beasts in Lin Yun’s path to pieces.

With just one sword, Lin Yun destroyed all demonic beasts below the Yin-Yang stage that were surrounding him. He even cleared the demonic beasts with stronger bloodlines that had grown stronger under the influence of the ominous aura.

“The greater Yin-Yang stage is truly different.” Lin Yun could sense that there was practically no exhaustion to his origin energy. His current origin energy wasn’t any weaker than a quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm senior.

A black Demonrune Leopard charged over like a bolt of lightning to launch a sneak attack on Lin Yun. However, Lin Yun swung his sword without even turning, splitting the demonic beast in two, “Die!”

Ji Wuye also emitted a crimson sword aura that enveloped his surroundings. Before any of the demonic beasts could approach, they were instantly riddled with holes. Ji Wuye’s crimson aura was even refining the ominous aura that the deceased demonic deasts emitted.

In addition to Lin Yun and Ji Wuye, the performances of the other geniuses were also brilliant. They were practically invincible against the Yin-Yang stage experts, and they could easily kill them. This was a brutal slaughter, but it didn’t take long for some quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beasts to eye them.

“Great timing!” Ji Wuye’s eyes lit up with excitement on his face. His figure flickered as he charged towards the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm Thunderpython. He then unleashed his cold aura as his sword rays left dozens of sinister wounds on the Thunderpython. The Thunderpython’s blood splattered all over the ground.

When the remaining crimson sword rays landed on the ground, they created several ravines. All Yin-Yang stage demonic beasts who stood in the path of the sword rays were killed. Ji Wuye’s sword technique was a lot more violent than it was half a month ago. Playfully, he looked at Lin Yun, “Haha.”

Lin Yun merely glanced at Ji Wuye briefly and ignored him. He had his own thoughts, and he didn’t treat the competition Ji Wuye mentioned seriously.

“Shatter Dragon Slash!” Another person was facing a quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beast. He was a youth whose cultivation was even higher than Lin Yun and Ji Wuye’s. He was in the pinnacle Yin-Yang stage and his name was Murong Qing.

Others might not be familiar with him, but cultivators from Swordmire City knew him well. He was the Scarletblood Sword Dojo’s young master, the strongest genius of Swordmire City. He was famed for his talent throughout the Thunder Prefecture. In terms of reputation, he was a lot stronger than Chu Muyan and Chen Ziyu.

His sword was decisively fast and his aura felt as if it could even cut through a dragon. His attack sent the demonic beast flying and created a huge crater on the ground.

“Murong Qing is indeed, Murong Qing.” The Azure Dragon Seeking Envoy smiled at Murong Qing’s performance. Among the geniuses in the Sword Alliance, Murong Qing was the brightest. The Azure Dragon Seeking Envoy was standing so near because he wanted to protect the former.

Then, his gaze began to wander around the battlefield in search of Lin Yun’s figure. But no matter how he searched, he couldn’t find any traces of Lin Yun.

In this battlefield, aside from some demonic cultivators and sects’ elders who were keeping a low profile, the various geniuses like Ji Wuye and Murong Qing were rather flashy.

Did I overestimate him? Long Hao muttered inwardly as everyone had been waiting for this battle for a long time. After all, a beast tide of such scale was hardly seen in a millennium. But he couldn’t find Lin Yun anywhere because Lin Yun’s performance wasn’t eye-catching enough.

Right at this moment, a crimson pillar soared into the sky and dyed it red. This instantly attracted everyone’s attention as eight more crimson pillars soared into the sky. Wu Xiaotian threw nine punches that caused the crimson pillars. Then, each pillar manifested into a viper that converged on his fist.

When his fist merged with the vipers, his attack reached the overlord quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beast. He instantly sent the demonic beast flying a few hundred meters away. When the demonic beast fell onto the ground, it wailed as it failed to get up.

“That was a little too terrifying. He sent an overlord quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beast flying with a single punch.”

“Is this the power of the top geniuses on the Dragoncloud Ranking?”

“He’s not just an ordinary top genius, he was ranked seventeen. If he didn’t run into Jiang Ziye, his ranking might be even higher.”

“Even some of the Heavenly Soul Realm experts aren’t able to injure the overlord quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beasts heavily. I can’t believe Wu Xiaotian accomplished that.” Wu Xiaotian’s performance shocked everyone as he shined like a lighthouse on the battlefield.

This made the faces of Qin Yang, Zhao Feng, and Xie Yu turn ugly as their auras became sharp. The other geniuses were also shocked before they started to throw out their strongest attacks. The observing cultivators became excited at this scene.

“Kill!”

“Slaughter all the demonic beasts!”

“Guard Swordmire City!” The entire battlefield boiled. But even under this boiling atmosphere, Lin Yun was still tempering his sword and heart at his own rhythm, practicing the Overlord Sword using Dustlight Sword Art’s style.

He constantly decomposed Thunderbolt Slash, Solar Slah, and Big Bang. It was clearly a domineering sword technique, but it became soft and gentle in his hand. His sword techniques weren’t eye-catching compared to those geniuses, but all the demonic beasts that encountered him felt terrible.

One would only understand how terrible the feeling was if they fought Lin Yun themselves. The moment the demonic beasts encountered Lin Yun’s sword aura, it would be impossible for them to escape. As time passed, the demonic beasts fighting Lin Yun gradually increased.

“Die! Crimsonsword Sweep!” Ji Wuye’s face became excited as he threw out his strongest attack, slicing the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beast in half. Then, he devoured the demonic beast’s demonic aura. Wearing a smile, Ji Wuye muttered to himself, “That was the fourth one.”

He had already slaughtered four quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beasts and only Murong Qing could compete with him in terms of this accomplishment. As for the sect’s elders and demonic cultivators, there was no way they could compete with him.

Suddenly, Ji Wuye thought of Lin Yun. Lin Yun’s sword technique and sword intent were powerful, but he was confident that there was no way Lin Yun could compare to him because his techniques were made for killing. After all, he wouldn’t bet with Lin Yun if he wasn’t confident.

Right at this moment, a genius not far away from him revealed a shocked expression as his jaw dropped.

“What the hell?” Ji Wuye became doubtful as he followed that youth’s gaze and saw an unbelievable scene before him. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

There weren’t any quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beast’s corpses around Lin Yun because he was facing nine at the same time. This completely dumbfounded Ji Wuye as this was too unbelievable, “How is that possible?!”
