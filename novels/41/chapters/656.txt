Chapter 657 - Ferocious Fight With Silverthunder Demonhawk

In the dusky swamp, a silver bolt flashed in the sky like a sharp blade tearing the clouds in two. From afar, it looked similar to a waterfall being split in two. Wherever the bolt of lightning went, countless demonic beasts in the swamp would panic and flee.

The bolt of lightning was naturally the Silverthunder Demonhawk. As one of the overlords of the swamp, it was akin to being an emperor of this region. This demonic beast didn’t need to eat that often and would go hunting every few months.

However, when it went hunting, all demonic beasts would panic, regardless of how ferocious they were. The scene of a hundred wolves fleeing was the best proof of the Silverthunder Demonhawk’s prestige and dominance.

Suddenly, the silver bolt of lightning descended like a meteor. When it landed on the ground, the ground trembled violently and a cloud of dust rose. From within the cloud of dust, a miserable shriek sounded out and a flaming lion could be seen.

But at this moment, it was lying on the ground with its colossal body pinned by a pair of claws. No matter how much it struggled, it wasn’t able to do anything. The claws were huge, but they were still considered slender when compared to the colossal figure that owned them.

Of course, the one that was feasting on the flaming lion was the Silverthunder Demonhawk. The surrounding demonic beasts were hiding in the dark. They bowed their heads as their bodies trembled in fear.

It only took a moment for the lion to be reduced to a skeleton. When the Silverthunder Demonhawk swallowed down the lion’s beast core with satisfaction, it swept its cold glance around at the surrounding demonic beasts.

Suddenly, a man and a horse appeared out of the mist. But they weren’t trembling in fear like the surrounding demonic beasts. On the contrary, they were slowly walking over. The Silverthunder Demonhawk instantly recognized Lin Yun as it looked at Lin Yun with detest. After all, it had seen this human a few days ago.

But just when it was about to spread its wings and leave, it suddenly turned its head around and stared at the Dragon Blooded Horse. The brimming vitality in the Dragon Blooded Horse had attracted its attention.

“Well, looks like I can’t even be compared to this fool in its eyes,” smiled Lin Yun with mockery. But that was to his benefit since he could save effort in attracting its attention.

Suddenly, a torrential killing aura soared into the sky, dying the entire region in red. Before they could react to the Silverthunder Demonhawk’s actions, the incoming wind pushed the Dragon Blooded Horse backwards. Right now, Lil’ Red was having great difficulty withstanding the wind.

“Great!” Lin Yun’s clothes fluttered in the wind as he threw his punch out, clashing against the Silverthunder Demonhawk’s claw.

But in the next second, Lin Yun threw up a mouthful of blood and flew backwards. When he landed on the ground, he retreated for a few steps before he managed to stabilize himself. He was shocked by the Silverthunder Demonhawk’s power.

The rebound made his insides spin as cracks appeared on his flesh. If his physique wasn’t strong, the rebound force would have ripped his skin open and injured his organs.

After sending Lin Yun flying, the Silverthunder Demonhawk glanced at him with disdain before it flapped its wings and unleashed a wind blade towards Lin Yun. Then, it charged at the Dragon Blooded Horse without turning back to face Lin Yun.

This startled the Dragon Blooded Horse as it turned to run. The Silverthunder Demonhawk was a natural predator and it could sense that Lin Yun wasn’t its opponent.

Fortunately, Lil’ Red was fast enough to evade the Silverthunder Demonhawk that was chasing it. When the wind blade clashed onto Lin Yun’s body, it caused a metallic collision. Lin Yun had only suffered some superficial wounds.

“It really disregards me…” Looking at the Silverthunder Demonhawk chasing after Lil’ Red, Lin Yun smiled. After all, he wouldn’t have an opportunity to kill the Silverthunder Demonhawk if its attention was on him.

Lin Yun was clear that this overlord demonic beast wasn’t just ferocious, but it was also fast. He only had one opportunity, so he couldn’t fail.

The Profound Lightning Shuttle appeared before him as Lin Yun began pouring his sword intent into it. As it rotated, the sharp tip left cracks in the surrounding air.

“Break!” Lin Yun’s face turned cold as he flicked his finger. With a flash of lightning, a brilliant sword buzz rang out as the ground began to tremble violently. The Silverthunder Demonhawk was still chasing after Lil’ Red and paid no attention to the Profound Lightning Shuttle.

Seeing that it was about to catch Lil’ Red, the Silverthunder Demonhawk suddenly flapped its wings and a boundless air current slowed the Dragon Blooded Horse down. If it was captured, there was no way the Dragon Blooded Horse’s defences could withstand its claw.

Just when Lil’ Red was about to be torn in half, the Profound Lightning Shuttle crashed into the Silverthunder Demonhawk. Attacked by the Profound Lightning Shuttle, the Silverthunder Demonhawk’s body swayed in mid-air, allowing Lil’ Red to escape.

But the Silverthunder Demonhawk’s body merely trembled before it chased after Lil’ Red again.

“Still ignoring me?” Lin Yun smiled eerily. “Let’s try something bigger!”

The eight remaining Profound Lightning Shuttle continued to slam into the Silverthunder Demonhawk. The last shuttle managed to pierce through its defences as its feathers began to fall along with blood.

This time, the Silverthunder Demonhawk was thoroughly enraged as it turned into a bolt of lightning and dashed towards Lin Yun. When the Silverthunder Demonhawk turned around, its demonic aura had enveloped half the sky along with creating an earth-shattering commotion.

Looking at the Silverthunder Demonhawk charging over, he smiled coldly as the Indigoflame Thunderwhip appeared in his hand. He had been luring for the Silverthunder Demonhawk for a long time.

Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly as the Azure Dragon Mark emitted a faint purple glow as the lightning runes on his body were activated before they poured into his right hand.

When the eighteen lightning runes gathered together, the Indigoflame Thunderwhip released a powerful lightning power that manifested into a lightning python. This caught the Silverthunder Demonhawk by surprise as it was knocked to the ground and its demonic aura began to dissipate.

This attack was earth-shattering, so it caused the Silverthunder Demonhawk to release a furious howl. Flapping its wings, it soared into the sky once more despite its injuries. Lin Yun was surprised by this. After all, he knew that he wouldn’t be able to withstand a diving attack from the Silverthunder Demonhawk.

“You want to fly? Dream on!” Lin Yun knew that it wouldn’t be easy for him to heavily injure the Silverthunder Demonhawk with the Indigoflame Thunderwhip, but he had an idea. As lightning flashed, he threw the Indigoflame Thunderwhip away and charged towards the Silverthunder Demonhawk. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Azure Dragon Palm!

Lin Yun’s face turned cold as his right hand moved like lightning, slicing through the sky as it turned into an azure dragon’s claw. When the dragon’s claw clashed with the Silverthunder Demonhawk, the hawk was smacked to the ground.

After this attack, the Silverthunder Demonhawk had a huge cut on its left wing and blood began to drip down. At this moment, the Silverthunder Demonhawk finally realized that the youth standing before it couldn’t be underestimated.

“The game has just begun. Sword!” Lin Yun reached out and the Flower Burial Sword flew into his hand.

Overlord Sword—Thunderbolt Slash!

Overlord Sword—Solar Slash!

The two attacks fell onto the Silverthunder Demonhawk as the sword ray exploded and left cuts on the ground. After using two of his strongest attacks, even Lin Yun was having difficulty facing the exhaustion as he gasped for his breath with beads of sweat falling from his forehead. But he didn’t have a choice. He knew that if the Silverthunder Demonhawk didn’t die, then he would be the one to die.

Lin Yun raised his brow and swung his sword along with a huge bark.

Overlord Sword—Big Bang!

In the next second, a massive lump of lightning flew out like a star as Lin Yun swung his sword. The star exploded with lightning, and the dazzling light made it difficult to keep one’s eyes open.

As the Silverthunder Demonhawk let out a howl, it was struck by the star and countless feathers broke off.

When Lin Yun landed on the ground, a huge crater was created. He was currently gasping for his air. Although he had added an attack to ensure the Silverthunder Demonhawk’s death, he was only barely able to use the third move of the Overlord Sword with his cultivation in the greater Yang stage.

A powerless and mournful howl came out of the crater as the Silverthunder Demonhawk looked up from the crater in despair. At this moment, it was a bald hawk without any feathers. It looked fat and bloated as it tried to crawl out of the crater.

Suddenly, a booming goofy laughter sounded out and the Silverthunder Demonhawk raised its head to see a crimson figure chuckling with its bucktooth revealed. It was naturally Lil’ Red, who ran back to watch.

The Silverthunder Demonhawk began to tremble as it lost its balance and fell down. Lil’ Red couldn’t hold back its laughter and fell to the ground.

Shortly after, a sword ray flashed and the Silverthunder Demonhawk was decapitated.
