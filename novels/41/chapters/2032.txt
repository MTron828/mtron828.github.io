Chapter 2033 - Xin Yan

Lin Yun nodded. He felt nothing was wrong with it because he had already seen nine swords. As long as he could see the last four swords, he would remember the second section of the Divine Firefly Sword.

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said, “The first sword, Withered Tree Coming To Life!”

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint drew her sword and gently tapped her feet on the ground as she began to rotate. It was like a towering divine tree that stood for thousands of years with white flowers blooming on the tree branches.

This tree seems familiar. It seems to be the Phoenix Tree… Lin Yun inwardly pondered. The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint’s version of Withered Tree Coming To Life differed entirely from Bai Shuying. But before he could look at it, he was sent flying by the sword aura, followed by a phoenix cry and the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint’s sword left a hole in the air, and Lin Yun wasn’t able to look at the sword because the dazzling radiance was stinging to the eyes.

He knew the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint restrained her strength beneath the Quasi-Saint Realm. So does that mean he could also achieve such power?

“Rising Sun!” The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint swung her sword with her aura undergoing a drastic change. When she soared to the sky, her sword intent had formed into a dazzling sun. Her Astral Sword Intent formed into a massive sun, and galaxies appeared after the sun. Nine galaxies were coiling around the sun, looking like a starry sky.

Lin Yun was shocked because he didn’t know Astral Sword Intent could be used this way.

“Polar Opposite!” The third sword was involved with space, and the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint appeared a thousand miles away. This was a misconception in space because the trajectory of her sword couldn’t be tracked.

“Flaming Floral Silver Tree!”

“Driving Lightning!”

“Sky Incineration Flames!”

“Intoxicating Nine Heavenly Wind!”

“Sky Streak Snow!”

“Four Peaceful Seas!”Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Moon Reflection Mirror!”

“Flowing Time!”

“Planting Soldiers!”

Lin Yun was dazzled by the thirteen swords and fell into a mysterious state. The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint had already sheathed her blade, but various images were lingering before Lin Yun, filled with the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint’s images.

The afterimages overlapped and separated, alternating between reality and illusion. The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint didn’t disrupt Lin Yun and waited for him to come to his senses. After he came to his senses, she asked, “Have you remembered them?”

“Just barely,” Lin Yun said.

“Let me ask you, do you notice any difference between the first and second sections of the Divine Firefly Sword?” The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint asked.

Lin Yun fell into brief thoughts and said, “I only find it dazzling and confusing with my head on the verge of exploding. If I have to say anything about it, the first section is an entirety because each sword form can be tracked. But the second section is more comprehensive, containing everything. But it’s random, since the sword forms aren’t linked together, containing various factors.”

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint was satisfied upon hearing that, and it was impressive that Lin Yun could have such comprehension after observing it once. It wasn’t an understatement to call Lin Yun a heaven-defying genius, but it was a pity he wasted time here with the Serene Dust Great Saint. Otherwise, she would’ve taught it to him a long time ago.

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint fell into brief thoughts before she said, “You’re right. The first section is an entire circle, while the second is stairs, with each flight as high as a thousand feet. When you reach the last sword, it will be over ten thousand feet high! It’s normal for you to find it in a mess. No more than ten people have practiced the second section before reaching the Quasi-Saint Realm in the past three years.”

Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts and wasn’t too surprised by that. He already knew that this sword technique was chaotic.

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said, “You should know that there are many powerful and ancient sword techniques in the world, passed down through generations. While they have been strengthened through the generations, those sword techniques have reached a terrifying height. But others cannot obtain those inheritances that have their successors, and they aren’t something others could obtain.”

“That’s for sure,” Lin Yun said.

“But the Sword Ancestor is different. He made his inheritance public and gave every swordsman an opportunity. As long as you’re talented enough, you can comprehend the Divine Firefly Sword he left behind without any restrictions,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said. “All the swordsmen in the world benefit from Sword Ancestor, and I hope you can rely on the Divine Firefly Sword to light the starry sky and shine in the next Sword Assembly.”

“Martial Aunt, you want me to attend the next Sword Assembly?” Lin Yun asked in a surprised tone. He naturally knew about the Sword Assembly, but the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint never expressed her intention to let him go.

“You have to go to the Hidden Sword Manor no matter what to retrieve something for your master,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said. “If not for your master, do you think that I’d pay attention to this Sword Assembly?”

Lin Yun’s heart sank because he had heard of it before. In the past, the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint showed no interest in the Sword Assembly.

“What is it?” Lin Yun asked.

“A sword. What else do you think? If not for that, why do you think I’d come to the Profound Maiden Courtyard?” The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said in a playful tone.

“Your cultivation has been low in the past, and I had no hope for you. But you must go now that you’re first on the King Ranking,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said. “With you around, there’s no need for anyone else to go.”

Lin Yun nodded and felt like it was a dream. He helped his senior brother, Jian Jingtian, retrieve his sword in the Lesser Sword Assembly. But the main Sword Assembly would be held soon, and he also had to retrieve a sword. But this time, he was helping his master!

Recalling his experiences during the Lesser Sword Assembly, Lin Yun’s facial expression became grave because that was held in a branch. But the Hidden Sword Manor was different because all the swordsmen around the world would show up. All the swordsmen who were beneath the Quasi-Saint Realm would turn up.

“What is this sword called?” Lin Yun asked, taking a deep breath.

“Cauldron,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said. “The Hidden Sword Manor forged many famous swords, but there are two special swords. One is called Firmament, and the other is called Cauldron. When the two swords are combined, they can be comparable to a divine artifact.”

When Lin Yun was in deep thought, the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint continued, “You have to obtain the sword no matter what because Firmament is already in Tian Xuanzi’s hands.”

“What?” Lin Yun widened his mouth with fury filling his pupils. It was Tian Xuanzi again. That fellow practically resorted to everything he could to destroy the Sword Sect. One must know that his master showed Tian Xuanzi kindness when Tian Xuanzi was young.

“I will obtain it no matter who stands before me!” Lin Yun said with a firm gaze.

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint nodded and said, “You can comprehend the Divine Firefly Sword yourself, since I can’t teach you too much. I can only say that the thirteen swords are related, even if it’s in a mess. When you’re done mastering the second section of the Divine Firefly Sword, I’ll teach you the remaining sections.”

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said and handed Lin Yun the second section of the sword technique.

As Lin Yun received it, he asked curiously, “What’s after the third section?”

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said, “Aside from leaving behind the three sections of the Divine Firefly Sword, the Sword Ancestor also left behind a Sword Monument. The monument is now in the hands of Sword Emperor Yu Qingfeng. Only those who’ve mastered the third section can be qualified to observe the monument.”

Lin Yun remembered what the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said in his heart, and it looked like he had to make a trip to Skysolute City in the future.

“Oh, how strong is Tian Xuanzi? How is he compared to you in terms of strength?” Lin Yun asked.

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint sighed, “How strong do you think you’ll be five hundred years from now?”

Lin Yun was briefly stunned because he didn’t know why the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint would ask that.

“Tian Xuanzi’s fame was spreading throughout the Eastern Desolation three hundred years ago. His fame wasn’t at all inferior to the current you, and many people feel that he can reach the height of the Nine Emperors when he reaches the Emperor Realm,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said.

“Not only that, but he also has a relationship with many forces. Many people owe him a favor, and many people respond with a word from him. There have been rumors that he will become the King of Eastern Desolation after resolving the Ancient Barren Domain.”

After the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint and Serene Dust Great Saint left, Lin Yun was alone in the plaza. Lin Yun held onto the sword technique book and sat beneath the Buddha, before flipping through the book. But his mind was full of Tian Xuanzi and the two swords, and he couldn’t focus on practicing the Divine Firefly Sword.

Lin Yun was blankly staring at the sword technique. He casually brandished his right hand and was a little irritated. Suddenly, Lin Yun’s face changed, and he unleashed a sword ray when he heard footsteps approaching. This was an instinctive response after he was feeling irritated.

The sword ray drew a series of exclamations. When Lin Yun came to his senses, he raised his head to see Xin Yan walking over. The sword ray was too fast, and she was entirely defenseless. Even if she managed to quickly dodge it, her wrist was injured, with blood dripping down.

In that split second, Lin Yun panicked and put down the book before rushing over. He couldn’t be bothered with too much right now and held onto Xin Yan’s wrist with regret filling his pupils. That might be a casual attack, but it contained Astral Sword Intent so she couldn’t dodge in time.

But fortunately, Xin Yan’s injuries weren’t serious. Her injuries were so deep that the bones could be seen.

“Damn it! Big Sister Xin Yan, bear with it a little. I’ll treat your injuries.” Lin Yun held Xin Yan’s wrist and circulated the Blue Dragon Bone to treat her injuries.

Suddenly, he was surprised that her injuries were rapidly recovering, forcing his Astral Sword Intent out.

Before Lin Yun could ask, Xin Yan smiled, “My dear junior brother, what are you thinking about? You nearly killed me earlier.”

Lin Yun was shocked when he heard how Xin Yan addressed him. She had changed her form of address when she was stopping the Serene Dust Great Saint and Heavenly Jade Sword Saint earlier. When Lin Yun had a slip of the tongue and called her ‘Xin Yan’ earlier, his identity was exposed.

Just like that, they both looked each other in the eyes.
