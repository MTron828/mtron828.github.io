Chapter 1437 - Silhouette

“Kill!” Chen Ling roared upon seeing Lin Yun drawing his sword. The golden flames enveloping his saint sword also began to expand rapidly. In the blink of an eye, his sword ray reached over thirty meters, looking like a mountain burning with flames. There was a netherserpent at the top of the mountain, which collided with the Flower Burial Sword.

When the two swords clashed, sparks flew around with chaotic energy spreading out in the manner of a shockwave. This instantly made everyone at Saint Pool Square retreat quickly.

But even when they retreated, they still couldn’t help watching Lin Yun and Chen Ling. The azure dragon that Lin Yun stood on rapidly withered. The azure dragon was like a flower that withered almost in seconds. Blood dripped down from the corner of Lin Yun’s lip as he was sent flying away under this attack, and his face also looked pale.

“So strong!” Lin Yun wiped the blood off his lips with surprise flashing through his pupils. Even his right hand was trembling as he held onto his sword. It was as expected of a genius on the Divine Firmament Peak. Lin Yun did not doubt that he could be a direct disciple with his strength.

“Chen Ling hid it really deeply. He actually managed to learn the Primordial Netherserpent Sword!”

“It’s dangerous to practice this sword technique because it’s a torturous process. It looks like Chen Ling is really persistent in becoming a direct disciple.”

“He’s almost thirty, right? If he doesn’t become a direct disciple this year, he'll lose many opportunities. He also might be unable to reach the four-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm before making a breakthrough to the Dragon Pulse Realm.” The square burst into an uproar as all the Divine Firmament Peak disciples admired Chen Ling.

When the azure dragon dissipated, Chen Ling heaved a sigh of relief with fighting spirit blazing in the depth of his pupils. Xiahou Yan’s ghost spirit martial technique was blocked by Lin Yun’s azure dragon, but he had slain the azure dragon. So this made him feel a sense of accomplishment.

“Primordial Netherserpent Sword!” Chen Ling charged forth once more, and his sword aura was filled with the aura of death.

When the two clashed again, one could notice that Lin Yun’s sword aura was slowly being eroded. The black serpent coiling around Chen Ling’s sword wrapped in golden flames was so peculiar for it to even corrode Lin Yun’s sword aura, making it hard to defend against. It was somewhat similar to Lil’ Red’s Devour Saint Rune.

“Lin Yun’s sword aura won’t last for much longer.”

“His dual sword souls are really powerful. If it’s someone else facing Chen Ling, their sword aura would’ve long been devoured. After all, this is the famous martial technique of my Divine Firmament Peak!”

“Lin Yun is too terrifying. If he’s also at the Heavenly Elysium Core Realm, Senior Brother Chen Ling probably wouldn’t last long in his hands, right?” Lin Yun was in a disadvantageous position against Chen Ling, but everyone in the Divine Firmament Peak had acknowledged his strength.

While everyone was talking amongst themselves, nearly 90% of Lin Yun’s sword aura had been corroded. Lin Yun was only left with his two sword souls guarding three feet around him. But everyone knew it wouldn’t be long before his sword souls were eroded as well.

Everyone felt that Lin Yun had to admit defeat or he would suffer severe injuries if his sword souls were corroded. It would even damage the foundation of his firmament sword intent.

“Is this the best he can do?” Feng Luan furrowed his brows. If Lin Yun lost terribly, not only would it damage his sword souls, but it would also look bad on the Radiant Sword Saint.

“Not yet.” But a voice stopped him just when he was about to step forth and stop this confrontation to declare Chen Ling’s victory. When all the direct disciples turned around, the peak master, Mu Chuan, had appeared without them knowing. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

When Chen Ling saw that Lin Yun’s sword aura was about to collapse, joy began to appear on his face because he was about to win. This also meant that he had not worked hard for the past three years for naught. Although he felt bad for Lin Yun, he couldn’t wait any longer because he was already thirty.

After inwardly apologizing to Lin Yun, Chen Ling pushed his sword aura to the limit, wanting to destroy Lin Yun’s sword aura. But right then, a chill exploded from Lin Yun as his firmament sword aura suddenly spread out. A dazzling light also burst out from his body before swiftly forming a painting, a constellation painting, behind him.

With a pair of eyes like the sun and moon, freezing all of eternity with one thought.

When Lin Yun raised his head, a massive aura from his pupils caught Chen Ling by surprise, sending Chen Ling flying away. Simultaneously, Lin Yun’s sword aura, which was on the verge of collapse, also began to expand after being empowered by his constellation.

“A ghost spirit martial technique is terrifying… but you should be reaching your limit.” Lin Yun’s gaze was indifferent as he charged with afterimages flying from him. When thirty-six afterimages flew out of him, each afterimage performed a sword technique that soon covered the sky with various phenomena and sword rays. The thirty-six intents represented thirty-six phenomena that bloomed at once. When all the afterimages overlapped, a holy spirit flew from him.

Looking at the four constellations behind Lin Yun, Chen Ling was dumbfounded, wondering if Lin Yun was a monster. How could someone possibly possess four constellations?

Damn it! Chen Ling’s eyes flashed with determination as he took the initiative to break off the remaining phoenix wing. When the wing fell off, it was reduced to blood and golden flames that entered his body. He had staked everything in this battle, so he couldn’t afford to lose!

The black serpent and white dragon fought when the two swords collided, causing lightning to flicker in the sky with a storm rising. A long time later, two figures flew out from the terrifying energy turbulence after all the phenomena settled down.

“Lin Yun, use whatever means you have!” Chen Ling was covered with injuries. There were a few claw marks on his chest with blood flowing through his sword and dripping off. He was like a madman with persistence filled in his pupils. He knew that he could still fight; he could still fight for it!

Chen Ling’s persistence touched Lin Yun, and he saw his past self in Chen Ling. The only difference was that he was still young while Chen Ling was already thirty. The age of thirty was pretty young in the Divine Dragon Era, even someone who reached forty-five could be considered a young man. But Chen Ling was awkward because he wasn’t a direct disciple at the age of thirty.

If Chen Ling wasn’t ambitious, he would’ve made his breakthrough to the Dragon Pulse Realm and automatically become a direct disciple. However, Chen Ling was ambitious. He wanted to reach the third-star, four-star, or even the fifth-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm before making his breakthrough into the Dragon Pulse Realm. Chen Ling had the ambition to walk further in the Dragon Pulse Realm; he had the ambition to become a saint!

“If you can take this attack of mine, consider it my loss.” Lin Yun said with fighting spirit blazing in his pupils. He wanted to execute the Sword of the Beginning. Most of his martial techniques came from others, but only the Sword of the Beginning belonged to him. So he wanted to use the move he created himself out of respect for Chen Ling.

The reason why he didn’t use it so often was that it wasn’t perfected yet. But he was moved when he saw his own silhouette in Chen Ling. Everyone had their shine, and no one was born inferior to others. Since they walked on the path of cultivation, they would have to compete with no path of retreat. Everyone had their own Sword of the Beginning.

“This is all the brilliance in my heart which I froze into a single moment and condensed it all in my sword!” Lin Yun calmly looked at Chen Ling as the Flower Burial Sword began to violently tremble.

The next moment, Lin Yun’s pupils shone brightly like the sun rising behind him. When the sun rose, boundless flames lit up the sky and expelled all the darkness, bringing life to everything in the world. All the brilliance he had seen in his life was condensed into this split moment.

As a terrifying phenomenon appeared, Lin Yun already swung his sword out before anyone could react. This sword was accompanied by an unrivaled aura that swept out. His sword ray turned into a red glow, dying the surroundings red as it began to expand. The sword ray he released was so dazzling that it looked like a deity.

When Lin Yun’s sword hit Chen Ling like a majestic sun, Chen Ling’s sword aura and the astral energy around him crumbled as he threw out a mouthful of blood before he fell onto the square. When he collided against Saint Pool Square, cracks began to spread out with a cloud of dust rising.
