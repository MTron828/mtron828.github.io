Chapter 1732 – Feeling of Love

After putting Yan Tianchen in a room, Lin Yun and Yue Weiwei laid on a grass patch outside the yard, looking at the moon. The night was serene, and their hearts were peaceful as they occasionally heard zither music sounding from afar.

Suddenly, they both turned to look at each other with rapport. When they looked at each other, they smiled, and Yue Weiwei leaned towards Lin Yun.

“Big Brother Lin, how did you spend the past four years?” Yue Weiwei looked at Lin Yun and asked.

Has it already been four years? Lin Yun was stunned before realizing that it had really been four years since they parted on the Heavenly Path. He stayed in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect for a year, and the Sword Sect for two years, so it was nearly four years now.

“After we parted on the Heavenly Path, I first went to the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect…” Lin Yun briefly hesitated before sharing his experience in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. He also didn’t hide the information about Su Ziyao from Yue Weiwei.

When moonlight shone on Yue Weiwei’s face, she was just quietly looking at Lin Yun, listening to his story. Upon hearing how Lin Yun killed with the flute during a full moon, her eyes narrowed into a smile because she knew he used the flute she gave him. It turned out that Lin Yun had carried it around with him.

When she heard about Lin Yun’s experience on Profound Wither Island, her emotions couldn’t help fluctuating. Upon hearing what Lin Yun experienced outside the Profound Wither Island, her heart was lifted to her throat. When she noticed the pain and anger when Lin Yun talked about his master, the Radiant Sword Saint, she couldn’t help feeling heartache for him.

Others only saw how Lin Yun killed a Great Saint outside the Ancient Barren Battlefield, but no one knew the sorrow and helplessness he felt when he saw his master’s arrival. His master was only left with five years of lifespan. So when he appeared, who knows how much lifespan he had left. Three years? Two years? Or one year? Hearing Lin Yun’s story made Yue Weiwei feel terrible.

Lin Yun continued his story and soon shared his objective for coming to the Nirvana Banquet. Only then did Yue Weiwei know that Lin Yun came for the Azure Dragon’s lineage, and she engraved it in her mind.

“I have never told anyone about it, so I feel much better now.” Lin Yun looked at Yue Weiwei with a smile.

Yue Weiwei looked at Lin Yun with heartache. Lin Yun was only at the Dragon Pulse Realm, but he had to face enemies like Tian Xuanzi. Not to mention that he didn’t have much time with his master due to his master’s remaining lifespan, so she could only imagine how much pressure Lin Yun was under.

“Big Brother Lin can tell me more in the future. I like to listen to anything related to you.” Yue Weiwei looked at Lin Yun.

“What about you?” Lin Yun smiled.

“Me? I’m alright. I have my father, Senior Sister, and everything is pretty good.” Yue Weiwei smiled, brushing past her story. But Mu Xueling did mention that it wasn’t easy for Yue Weiwei to come here.

“Big Brother Lin, why don’t I dance for you?” Yue Weiwei suddenly sat up and held onto Lin Yun’s hand.

“The Nine Heavenly Profound Dance?” Lin Yun asked.

“Hehe, not that. That is for the divine mountain ceremony. I’ll dance something my mother taught me.” Yue Weiwei gently leaped, and she smiled at Lin Yun. She continued, “Big Brother Lin, you can play a casual song, and I’ll follow up.”

Lin Yun briefly pondered before he retrieved the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute and played the Phoenix Heart Song. When he started playing the song, the moonlight was manipulated by Lin Yun, and it manifested into flowers that descended under the musical note.

“How beautiful.” Yue Weiwei reached out, looking at the moonlight falling on her palm.

A brief moment later, she began to dance under the Phoenix Heart Song. Unlike the solemnness and ethereal of the Nine Heavenly Profound Dance, Yue Weiwei’s movements were agile like a white fox under the moon. This made her look charming, and when she looked at Lin Yun, the charm of her smile was fatal.

She wore a red dress with a wide sleeve, and the dance looked flawless, like a painting. When she danced, she emitted a bizarre fragrance that made heaven and earth pale in comparison to her. This would instantly captivate everyone’s attention, and her smile was bright like the spring, innocent and spiritual.

Lin Yun’s attention was entirely captivated by her. Yue Weiwei had perfectly matched his music, and his musical notes already manifested into moonlight. Her body was gentle as she gently stepped on the moonlight. Yue Weiwei gently descended from the sky like a cloud when the song ended.

Lowering the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute, Lin Yun reached out and Yue Weiwei held onto his hand with a smile. Yue Weiwei’s face blushed while nervously looking at Lin Yun, “Big Brother Lin, is my dance nice?”

“It’s beautiful.” Lin Yun said.

“Hehe. This is the Spiritual Fox Dance my mother taught me. She said that all ladies of the Fox Clan need to know this dance, and we won’t be able to find our other half if our dance isn’t good.” Yue Weiwei smiled. “If Big Brother Lin likes it, I’ll only dance for you in the future.”

With a smile, Lin Yun nodded his head.

“Hehe. Big Brother Lin, let’s go out and have fun. I heard the saint city is fun, but no one could accompany me before because I’ve been staying on the snowy mountain.” Yue Weiwei said.

“I’ve also never strolled in the saint city before.” Lin Yun replied.

“Let’s go. Senior Sister should be asleep now.” Yue Weiwei stuck out her tongue and comforted herself.

After making up their minds, they changed their clothes and quietly left the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion. When they left, Yue Weiwei was extremely nervous. But she soon became excited, “Hehe. Senior Sister didn’t notice me.”

Lin Yun wasn’t too sure about that, and he turned around. “I can feel a pair of eyes on us for some reason. Saint Elder probably discovered us already.”

“Big Brother Lin, you’re foolish. If I say that no one discovered us, then no one discovered us.” Yue Weiwei said.

Lin Yun scratched his head when he heard that. When Yue Weiwei saw Lin Yun's awkwardness, she pulled him along and smiled, “Let’s go.”

A thousand meters away, Mu Xueling and the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s pavilion master stood together as they watched Yue Weiwei leave.

“You really guessed it.” The Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s pavilion master smiled.

“Junior Sister is smart. When I told her to rest, she guessed I’d let her leave the mountain.” Mu Xueling replied.

“If she puts her entire attention on cultivation, her current achievements won’t be inferior to her mother’s.” The Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s pavilion master said.

With a gentle expression, Mu Xueling smiled, “But aunt is still alive, and she will be happy to see her like this. Junior Sister has loved to smile since she was young, but I know that she was never genuinely happy. She doesn’t like to live like someone else.”

Over the next seven days, Lin Yun and Yue Weiwei strolled the Heavenly Domain City, abandoning all their troubles. They would tour the entire city on a boat, try various delicacies, or tour ancient ruins. When they did nothing, they would stare into the sky, dazing off.

Seven days weren’t long, but the days they spent together were long and serene. Seven days later, it was night when they returned to the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion. The Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion was peaceful compared to the past, and most people were already asleep.

When Lin Yun returned to his room, he noticed that Yue Weiwei was following behind him. Yue Weiwei said, “Big Brother Lin, the sky is already dark. It’s not safe to return at night.”

Lin Yun wore a weird expression when he heard that, and he asked, “Weiwei, are you serious?”

Hearing that made Yue Weiwei’s face blush, and she glared at Lin Yun, “Don’t imagine it! That’s not what I mean!”

“I didn’t.” Lin Yun replied awkwardly.

“You’ll be going to the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion tomorrow, and Big Brother Lin might not return. So I want to stay with you longer.” Yue Weiwei lowered her head.

“You’ll be coming along as well, right?” Lin Yun asked in a surprised tone.

“But…” Yue Weiwei began to sob, and she hugged Lin Yun. “I only want you for myself. But you won’t only be mine after tomorrow.”

“Don’t cry. You’re no longer a child.” Lin Yun smiled gently.

“Big Brother Lin, I can’t sleep.” Yue Weiwei looked at Lin Yun.

“Let me play something for you.” Lin Yun said gently, and he took out the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute before the window. When he started playing the Phoenix Heart Song, the song was serene, like moonlight cleansing Yue Weiwei’s heart. Yue Weiwei laid on the bed, staring at Lin Yun. But before she knew it, she already fell asleep.

Seeing Yue Weiwei falling asleep, Lin Yun’s pupils were filled with doting, and his music became even more gentle. His music was beautiful, and even the moon had reappeared as if the flute music attracted it.

The next day when dawn arrived, Yue Weiwei opened her eyes to see Lin Yun leaning on the table, sleeping, but he firmly held onto the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute. This made her wonder if Lin Yun played the entire night, and she wore a smile as she came over to Lin Yun. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Staring at Lin Yun’s face, a cunning light flashed in her pupils, and she gave Lin Yun a peck on his cheek. Her face then turned red from shyness, with her heart throbbing. Her face was red, and she wondered if Lin Yun had discovered it.

She soon wondered if she should give Lin Yun another peck. When that thought appeared in her mind, she could no longer be restrained. But just when Yue Weiwei leaned down, Lin Yun suddenly opened his eyes and grabbed onto Yue Weiwei’s wrist.

When they looked at each other, Yue Weiwei’s face turned red like a child who did something wrong. But this brought a smile to Lin Yun’s face because she was adorable.

Sharing a smile, Lin Yun stood up and pulled her into his embrace before they kissed. Yue Weiwei’s heart throbbed violently when they kissed, but she soon calmed down and only felt blissful.

Was this the feeling of falling in love with someone? Tears rolled down Yue Weiwei’s cheeks, and an unprecedented smile bloomed on her face.
