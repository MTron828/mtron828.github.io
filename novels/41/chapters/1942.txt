Chapter 1943 - Heartless

Ten miles away from Indigo Thunder Peak, Bai Shuying suddenly released her aura at the ninth transformation of the Nirvana Stage, emitting a radiance from her body that looked like a lamp.

Beneath the Silvermoon Mask, Lil’ Purple threw out a mouthful of blood, with her face becoming pale. She let out a cough and seemed helpless at this moment. “Why is this lass so terrifying…”

She had underestimated Bai Shuying. If someone else had taken Bai Shuying’s palm head-on, that person would’ve lost their life on the spot. With just a glance, she could tell that Bai Shuying was experienced in fighting, and she was a ruthless person who aimed to take her opponent's life when making a move. It appears that she wasn’t lying when she told Lin Yun that she had killed many people.

Just when Bai Shuying was swiftly catching up with Lil’ Purple, the latter turned around, formed seals with saint runes pouring out, and constructed a painting, “Praise the Phoenix!”

When the painting unfolded, a vivid phoenix appeared with a terrifying sword aura accumulated in the flames.

“A Saint Spiritualist?” Bai Shuying stopped, looking at Lil’ Purple with surprise.

“Hmph. I’m a Divine Spiritualist at birth. If you’re tactful, you should go down on your knees and take me as your master. You might have an opportunity that way.” Lil’ Purple tugged her arms before her chest and didn’t look injured.

“Oh?” Bai Shuying already noticed that Lil’ Purple was putting on a strong front.

Seeing that Bai Shuying was still approaching, Lil’ Purple inwardly cursed and flicked her finger, unleashing the phoenix. She coldly said, “I have already made my move, and it’s too late for you to regret it now!”

But when the phoenix was about to get close to Bai Shuying, threads flew out from her body, and the phoenix began to disintegrate as her hands changed. It didn’t take long for the phoenix to be reduced to saint runes before dissipating, and everything took place too quickly. Bai Shuying easily resolved a saint diagram that could inflict injuries to a Quasi-Saint.

“How is this possible?” Lil’ Purple was shocked that Bai Shuying was also proficient in spiritual runes, and her attainment wasn’t weak. Was this the true strength of the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden? But what shocked her was Bai Shuying’s method in resolving her saint diagram.

“Who’s your other accomplice?” Bai Shuying hovered in the air with her hair draped down like a waterfall.

“You’ve mastered the Heavenly Silkworm Hands pretty well, but there are three flaws in it, and it’s not perfect. The profundity of the Heavenly Silkworm Hands doesn’t lie in being fast, but slow. As slow as possible, like fine rain and the flowing water.” Lil’ Purple was still aloof, even after her saint diagram was destroyed.

“You actually know about the Heavenly Silkworm Hands? Who the hell are you?” Bai Shuying’s emotions fluctuated for the first time.Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“What do you mean that I know about it? This was casually created by me in the past, and there are a hundred and eight transformations. Even so… only the Heavenly Fate Gate’s Thousand Fate Transformation and the Myriad Flower Valley’s Celestial Fairy Hands can be compared to it,” Lil’ Purple snickered.

“What bullshit.” Bai Shuying was inwardly shocked, but she didn’t stop her attack. She took a step forth and appeared before Lil’ Purple. After ten-odd clashes later, Lil’ Purple was sent flying away with a palm from her.

Bai Shuying didn’t continue to attack and said, “Stop resisting and remove your mask. You just have to answer a few questions of mine. That palm earlier was the Dragon Snapping Palm, and you won’t be able to recover from it anytime soon.”

“Lil’ Red!” Lil’ Purple yelled.

Just when Bai Shuying was perplexed, a black ray shot over. Lil' Red executed a martial technique, forcing Bai Shuying to exchange a palm with the cat. The cat’s paw would change between a fist and a claw. This rare martial technique alternated between the fist and claw, and a dragon roar also accompanied each attack.

Ten-odd moves later, Lil’ Red let out a meow before pushing its palm down, and its palm manifested into a dragon claw. Light converged to form a dragon claw in the surroundings before flying towards Bai Shuying.

When Bai Shuying made her move and shattered the dragon claw, Lil’ Purple had already fled with Lil’ Red. When she saw that they would enter Indigo Thunder Peak, Bai Shuying was calm and composed, her hands forming into a seal, and she barked, “Dragon Locking Shackles!”

A radiance around Bai Shuying spread out like threads. It looked like an ancient gate had opened behind her, and multiple shackles shot forth, chasing after Lil’ Purple and Lil’ Red, reaching them in the blink of an eye.

Right then, a sword vibration echoed, and a sword descended from the sky, executing a sword technique that severed all the shackles.

“Who is it?!” Bai Shuying’s face changed. This person must be a genius since this person could manipulate the sword from afar and destroy her secret technique.

But she didn’t receive a reply, and the sword flew towards Bai Shuying after severing the shackles. The sword intent empowered on the sword had reached a terrifying height, and the shockwave of the clashes caused the surrounding ground to shatter with rubble flying around.

As the sword attacked, Bai Shuying was forced to take ten steps back. Ultimately, she had no choice but to draw her sword, activating its glory spirits and knocking the incoming sword away.

A sword returned to the foot of Indigo Thunder Peak, and Lin Yun sheathed the Flower Burial Sword. At the same time, the sounds of a horse galloping resounded. It was Lil’ Red, who took the Dragon-Blooded Horse’s form, and it was carrying Lil’ Purple on it’s back.

“You scumbag. I’d be dead if you still weren’t coming…” Lil’ Purple removed the Silvermoon Mask and looked at Lin Yun with a pitiful gaze.

Seeing Lil’ Purple’s state, Lin Yun felt heartache, but it wasn’t the time for him to ask about it now. He said, “Go inside the Iris Secret Realm first.”

After Lil’ Red and Lil’ Purple entered the Iris Secret Realm, Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon Sword Heart sensed Bai Shuying’s aura before he could return to Indigo Thunder Peak. Knowing it was too late for him to leave, Lin Yun returned his sword to the sword box and sat down to meditate.

Bai Shuying descended from the sky a few breaths later and was surprised to see Ye Qingtian.

“Senior Sister Bai!” Lin Yun looked pleasantly surprised upon seeing Bai Shuying.

“Ye Qingtian, what are you doing here?” Bai Shuying asked.

“I should be the one asking Senior Sister Bai that. I’m the chief disciple of Indigo Thunder Peak, so why can’t I be here? Speaking of which, why are you here so late at night?” Lin Yun smiled.

Bai Shuying didn’t bother talking to Ye Qingtian. Her gaze fell onto the weird sword box.

Just when she was hesitating if she should ask Ye Qingtian to open it, Lin Yun smiled and stepped forth, “This is my sword box. Senior Sister is interested in it?”

As Lin Yun spoke, he opened the sword box and revealed the Flower Burial Sword.

Bai Shuying was disappointed because it wasn’t what she was expecting. Then again, since that person could sever her Dragon Locking Shackles, his strength was on the same level as hers. Even if Ye Qingtian became first in the Di Group, he shouldn’t possess that strength and wasn’t worthy of her suspicion.

“Senior Sister, why don’t you have a seat within Indigo Thunder Peak since you’re here? I can also use this opportunity to explain our misunderstanding,” Lin Yun said as he closed the sword box.

“There’s no misunderstanding.” Bai Shuying refused. She might enter Indigo Thunder Peak if she didn’t see Ye Qingtian here, but there was no need since he was here. This had always been how she was, and she would sour her mood if she saw someone she disliked.

“Dappled shadows hang a slant over clear shallow water; secret fragrance wafts in the moonlit dusk. Senior Sister’s name is related to the poem Singing Plum Blossom, and you’re also using a sword related to it…” Just when Bai Shuying turned around, Lin Yun’s voice resounded, making Bai Shuying inwardly sneer because that wasn’t the meaning behind her name.

But as she recited the poem, it did make sense. For some reason, she stopped and wanted to hear how Ye Qingtian would respond. She turned around and said, “That’s not the meaning behind my name.”

Lin Yun’s face froze when he saw Bai Shuying stop. He was only putting on an act, and he didn’t expect that Bai Shuying would really turn around to listen to him. This made him bitterly smile because he was in a hurry to examine Lil’ Purple’s injuries and had no time to deal with Bai Shuying. He awkwardly smiled, “So it’s a misunderstanding… Let’s pretend I didn’t say anything.”

Bai Shuying was puzzled by Ye Qingtian’s reply. If she remembered correctly, Ye Qingtian wouldn’t stop speaking so easily. So what did he mean by let’s pretend that he didn’t say anything?

“Senior Sister, you’re not leaving?” Lin Yun said just when Bai Shuying was hesitating, this naturally caused her emotions to fluctuate. She had always been aloof, but for some reason, her emotions greatly fluctuated ever since Ye Qingtian returned.

Bai Shuying was briefly stunned before she coldly looked at Lin Yun, “You think I want to come? Ye Qingtian, I’ll leave now, and I won’t come close to Indigo Thunder Peak ever again!”

When Bai Shuying turned around and disappeared, Lin Yun sighed because he knew their misunderstanding had deepened. But he couldn’t be bothered about that and returned to his residence before entering the Iris Secret Realm and rushing to the Phoenix Tree.

Lil’ Purple was sitting beneath the Phoenix Tree with her eyes closed. When she sensed Lin Yun’s approach, she opened her eyes and said in disdain, “Scumbag, it’s as expected of you to be so heartless!”
