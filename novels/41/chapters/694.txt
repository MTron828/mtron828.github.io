Chapter 695 - Purple Radiance

The secret realm was massive, and it would take at least half a month for Lin Yun to search the entire place. Lin Yun looked around and was at a loss.

Closing his eyes, he allowed his sword intent to spread out. His xiantian sword intent had already reached complete mastery and was usually more useful than his eyes. It could allow him to detect danger in advance along with detecting small differences.

Suddenly, Lin Yun opened his eyes and his pupils flashed coldly. He could sense a faint threat with his sword intent along with a great pressure. Looking into the distance, the Azure Dragon Mark bloomed on his chest as his muscles tensed up. He could faintly sense a terrifying existence in the distance.

He knew that it must be the core region of the secret realm. Lin Yun was confident in his discovery and turned into a golden streak as he sped off. Since the realm was massive, he hadn’t been able to exit his current region, even after traveling for two hours. In fact, there was a chill enveloping this atmosphere that made his heart heavy.

While traveling, he saw many people, but they could only see a rough outline of his figure. After all, it would be troublesome if they recognized him. Aside from the people, there were also many ferocious demonic beasts.

Many cultivators who entered the secret realm had become food to the demonic beasts, and Lin Yun could sense demonic beast’s gazes on him at all times. The demonic beasts of this realm were extremely intelligent and they didn’t dare to approach him after sensing the Azure Dragon aura that Lin Yun was giving off.

In the end, they could only watch as Lin Yun left. Along the way, he noticed many rare spiritual herbs. A lot of the cultivators fought over them, but Lin Yun didn’t even stop to take a glance. He was only interested in jade slips, ancient techniques, and weapon fragments that contained ancient sword intent.

As the night gradually approached, a lot of people suddenly flew in front of Lin Yun. They seemed to have entered a danger zone and were being forced back. They yelled as they ran with injured bodies, “Damn it, run!”

“This is too terrifying. What the hell is this place?”

“It hurts!” Many people’s eyes flashed when they passed by Lin Yun. But they couldn’t be bothered with Lin Yun as they continued to run for their lives.

Just when Lin Yun was feeling doubtful, a surge of chill suddenly swept over. When Lin Yun raised his head, he could see black clouds rolling over with many people running away from the black clouds.

When some of the cultivators saw the fleeing group, they quickly hid themselves in a panic. When they saw the black clouds, they saw a black storm that swept up everyone in its path. Black blades came out of the storm that left wounds on everyone’s bodies before mist seeped into the wounds.

When the black mist entered their bodies, black lightning began to shuttle within their bodies. The pain was agonizing for the victims.

Lin Yun was hiding behind a rock as he enveloped himself with sword intent. He was looking at the victims as he fell into deep thought. A brief moment later, he noticed that the black wind was actually the lightning energy of the yin element and that it was like densely packed worms.

Even some experts who had a strong physique were tortured horribly by the lightning energy. This scene left many people surprised before they fled for their lives. Unless one had a powerful cultivation, they would be left in a terrible state when they were enveloped by the black wind.

But it made no sense for this bizarre storm to appear for no reason. Lin Yun’s eyes flickered as he could see some figures enduring the black wind. It looks like some people also felt the same as him, thinking that there might be a huge opportunity awaiting them in the black wind. Furthermore, the wind came too suddenly, so he expected that it would stop sooner or later.

“Weird, why am I hiding like everyone else?” Lin Yun suddenly smiled. If the lightning energy was dangerous to others, it could pose no danger to him. In the end, he had subconsciously hid himself like everyone else. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Dispersing the sword intent that enveloped him, Lin Yun walked into the black storm. When the wind landed on his face, it felt painful like a blade slicing his skin. But when the energy tried to drill its way into his body, it was refined by a purple mist and was devoured by the azure dragon energy within his body.

This feels...great! Although the black wind was painful, he could refine the energy constantly to strengthen his azure dragon energy. Refining the black wind was equivalent to refining the Five Acute Lightning Crystals. If he could stay for a period of time to refine the energy, it would be equivalent to refining ten Five Acute Lightning Crystals. After all, the energy contained in the wind was like the endless ocean.

“Is this fellow insane?”

“It won’t take long for him to get himself killed.”

“What a fool!” Those who were hiding were trembling in fear. When they saw Lin Yun enter the black wind while protecting himself with his origin energy and sword intent, they were shocked. But it didn’t take long for everyone to sense something unusual about this situation.

The thin purple mist around Lin Yun became even more refined. In the end, the purple mist actually became dense and caused Lin Yun to glow like a majestic immortal.

“What the hell is going on?”

“This sword slave is becoming more and more mysterious.”

“Holy shit, we’re in such a pathetic state from the wind, but he’s growing stronger under it.”

“This makes no sense!”

“Damn it, the seven geniuses should deal with him quickly.” All those who were mocking Lin Yun earlier suddenly felt their faces turning black and felt the urge to throw up blood.

Unintentionally, Lin Yun had gone deeper into the black storm. A while later, he sat down on a hill to refine the energy in the black storm. Lightning began to rumble within his body along with a dragon roar that enveloped him in purple radiance.

The surrounding energy moved like demonic beasts charging against his body and under the swarm, the azure dragon energy within his body constantly grew stronger. As time passed, the black storm weakened before it ultimately disappeared in the morning.

Lin Yun opened his eyes with reluctance before he retracted the purple mist around him. His azure clothes made him look like a lotus, especially the purple mark on his forehead that made him look even more bewitching.

When sword intent flashed within his pupils, his temperament became even more extraordinary, like a mixture between a demon and an immortal.

But Lin Yun’s current state wasn’t stable. The Azure Dragon Enneaform was too strong and his cultivation was too weak to control it. On the contrary, his sword intent was powerful enough to contain the power within his body to prevent it running amok.

In just one night, the dragon runes on his body had grown from nine to eleven. When he noticed it, even he couldn’t help feeling somewhat afraid. But after the initial excitement, he started feeling irritated. After all, it wasn’t good news for his physique to be too powerful.

“This isn’t the solution.” Lin Yun feels that his cultivation was lacking far behind. So much so that he couldn’t control the Azure Dragon Battle Armor with his cultivation. If this continued, there would be a problem with his martial cultivation sooner or later.

But Lin Yun pushed that aside for now as he wanted to see what was in the depth of this black storm.
