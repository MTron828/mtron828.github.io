Chapter 2346 - Blood Dying Sky

Along with Lin Yun’s appearance, Lin Jiangxian, Ji Zixi, and Xiong Tiannan calmed down as they looked at him as though he could resolve everything. Lin Yun had become the leader amongst them because of his strength, and the other cultivators also looked over with shock and curiosity.

After all, Lin Jiangxian, Ji Zixi, and Xiong Tiannan had displayed terrifying strength. That was especially the case with Lin Jiangxian, who could fight Gu Tian and Gu Feichen after executing the Heavenly Divine Sword. But even so, Lin Jiangxian seemed to have acknowledged Lin Yun as the leader and sheathed her sword upon seeing him coming over. Was that confidence in him?

“Who is he? He dares to challenge Gu Jun?”

“Gu Jun is ranked in the top hundredth, and many divine disciples aren’t his opponent.”

“I heard that ordinary deities couldn’t catch his attention, which was why he didn’t become a divine disciple.”

“Isn’t that bullshit? He already has a deity in the clan, so why take others as his master if they couldn’t even rival his ancestor?”

Everyone’s gazes fell on Lin Yun. Some geniuses even stopped climbing the stairs and turned around.

Beside Gu Jun, Gu Xing wanted to make a move but was stopped by Gu Jun. The latter looked at Lin Yun, and indifferently said, “I know you. You call yourself Flower Burial, and you’re the one who defeated Wang Jue a month ago.”

Others only treated it as a rumour, but Gu Jun knew it was true.

As Lin Yun slowly approached, he stopped beside Lin Jiangxian and the others. He smiled, “That’s right. I’m Flower Burial, but it’s not a title.”

Gu Jun wore a playful smile, and said, “Not only that, but you've even obtained nine Golden Dao Fruits before defeating Wang Jue.”

He knew what happened on Qilin Mountain down to the smallest detail. He was also the one who instructed Gu Yuxin to probe them since he was curious about how many Golden Dao Fruits Lin Yun refined. He couldn't refine all of them, so the most would be five; otherwise, there wouldn’t be any effects. But he never expected that he couldn’t force Lin Yun to make a move even when things became so chaotic.

“So what?” Lin Yun raised his brow.

“Hahaha! As expected of someone from the Kunlun Realm,” Gu Jun sneered. “I’ll be honest with you. I was the one who planned this today, and I’m not the only one after your Golden Dao Fruits.”

“At least you’re honest,” Lin Yun said with a chill gathering in his eyes.

Gu Jun wasn’t bothered, and said, “I’m not afraid to tell you that Wang Jue is nothing before me.”

When he finished speaking, he raised his head with stars flashing in his eyes and a powerful aura swept out from him. This aura came with him when he was born, and he didn’t need to release it on purpose in front of the many powerless people before him. He even had to restrain it since it was easy for him to injure the innocent.

“I have had protection from the stars since I was born. I was an Empyrean at three, Dragon Pulse at ten, and Samsara Edict at fifteen. Lin Yun, I was born a king, and people like you from the Kunlun Realm can’t imagine my experience. So don’t try and test me, since you will die terribly. Tell me honestly how many Golden Dao Fruits you’ve refined. Otherwise, not a single person you care about can leave today!” Gu Jun was domineering as he became the center of attention.

The stairs began to tremble, frightening many people, and their faces became pale. They were mainly here to try it and never thought about obtaining a quota since they knew themselves well, but they didn’t expect that there would be such a huge difference between them and a genuine genius.

At this moment, they finally realized the difference between them and actual geniuses, causing despair to rise in their hearts. Gu Jun was too powerful. He was already standing at the end of the path at birth.

Lin Yun tried releasing his sword intent, but it didn’t affect the pressure on him. Not only him but Ji Zixi and the others were also affected by it. He said, “I’m not interested in your experience, and you can’t imagine mine, either.”

Gu Jun was briefly stunned, before he laughed, “Don’t misunderstand. I’m not concerned about your experience. Perhaps my attitude made you misunderstand, but I don’t care about you. In my eyes, you’re merely mortal blood. So answer me honestly!”

Ji Zixi and Lin Jiangxian frowned, feeling that something wasn’t right.

“It doesn’t matter even if you've refined all of them because I can just retrieve your saint origin,” Gu Jun said. His words caused an uproar with surprise flashing across Lin Yun’s eyes.

Gu Xing sneered beside Gu Jun, “Shocked? You should be honored that the saint origin of a mortal blood like you can be dug out.”

“Well, I’m really honored, then,” Lin Yun sneered.

“Still being so stubborn? I’ll help myself to it, then!” Gu Jun unleashed a powerful sword aura as his skin suddenly turned jade. He arrived before Lin Yun and threw a punch out. Gu Jun not only practiced the Gu Clan’s Primordial Astral Art, but also practiced a body-refining technique called the Golden Jade Divine Physique that required him to devour Bloodflame Golden Jade with saint runes.

Upon reaching a high level with it, it was even more terrifying than acquired divine physiques, but the resources were astronomical. Aside from Divine Clans and some immortal holy lands, only a few could bear the exhaustion of resources. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Gu Jun had reached a terrifying height with it, and his physique was comparable to a Glory Saint Artifact.

Lin Yun easily dodged his punch as though he was strolling.

“Primordial Astral Galaxy!” Gu Jun’s sword mastery wasn’t low. He used his fingers to perform the Gu Clan’s sword technique, the Divine Astral Sword. With just a finger, it felt like Gu Jun could pierce through a star and his sword aura reached a terrifying height.

“Sovereign Dragon Fist—Soaring Divine Dragon!” Lin Yun’s fist shone with seven colors as he unleashed this strongest fist technique from the Kunlun Realm. He had already reached the manifestation stage with the Sovereign Dragon Fist, and he unleashed over a hundred divine dragons with a single punch. There was also a golden crow and divine phoenix. He had fused the profundity of the Divine Solar Lunar Fist into it.

When Lin Yun and Gu Jun clashed, they were knocked away as the golden crow and divine phoenix shattered, with only the divine dragon staying intact. Lin Yun took three steps back and looked at the wound in his palm. He smiled because the Ancient Divine Clan’s genius did have some strength. As he circulated the Blue Dragon Bone, his injuries recovered in the next second.

Gu Jun was shocked when he raised his head and looked at Lin Yun. His cultivation was at the pinnacle of the sixth-stage Saint Lord and had refined a lot of primordial aura, having his golden pill constantly being tempered. He should be able to easily suppress Lin Yun and even pierce through Lin Yun’s golden pill with that sword.

“It looks like the Golden Dao Fruit is a treasure that allows you to greatly benefit.” Gu Jun’s eyes lit up, and he smiled, “You’re pretty lucky. The Golden Dao Fruit allows you to change the fate of mortal blood. This is interesting.”

As Gu Jun spoke, he had greed flashing in his eyes.

“Well, that’s not entirely wrong,” Lin Yun admitted with a smile. What Gu Jun said wasn’t wrong, but he wasn’t entirely right either since he had also obtained the Eternal Dao Fruits.

“But they’re mine now!” Gu Jun laughed with his hair fluttering in the wind with excitement reflected in his eyes. Since the Golden Dao Fruit had such an effect on mortal blood, wouldn’t the effect be much more significant for him? Someone with a lowly birth like Lin Yun shouldn’t possess such treasures.

Gu Jun laughed as he charged forth with eighteen galaxies around him, and a sun was hovering amongst the galaxies. As he flicked his finger, the galaxies turned into a sword ray that shot at Lin Yun.

“My eyes!”

“It hurts!”

The sword ray was too dazzling, making many people in the surroundings scream as they became caught by surprise.

“Dragon Sun and Moon Seal—Inverting Yin-Yang!” Lin Yun formed a seal that he had long reached the deification stage with. But it was different this time since the Azure Dragon Divine Rune was also in it, along with his sword intent and two sword canons. With a wave of his hand, Lin Yun roared as a sun and a moon flew out from his body, separating heaven and earth, putting a distance between them.

Everyone was shocked because Gu Jun’s sword ray suddenly became tiny and scattered about, causing heaven and earth to tremble. This caught Gu Jun by surprise, before he was forced to take a few steps back.

“Dragon Sun and Moon Seal—Blood Dying Sky!” Lin Yun laughed as he soared to the sky with crimson radiance covering half of the sky. When Lin Yun threw his punch out, the seal turned into a beam that shot out as a majestic and grand aura appeared, dying the sky red.

Three thousand Greater Daos, but only the Sword is supreme!
