ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Lin Yun didn’t bother hiding his killing intent as he spoke loud enough for the Nether Divinity War Realm to hear. The gray-clothed youth who spoke earlier replied coldly, “Kill all of us? You’re simply courting death. I’m going to make you suffer a fate worse than death when I catch you!”

Meanwhile, the leader sneered, “You think you’re invincible because you defeated two small fries from the Elysium Trigram War Realm? I bet it’ll be interesting to watch the Elysium Trigram Realm Son slap your face later.”

“You guys really know how to boast. I suggest you leave right now or else you won’t make it out alive,” replied Lin Yun coldly.

“Silence, you imbecile!” The leader’s furious roar echoed out in the horizon, which tore the clouds apart. At this moment, every single person from the Nether Divinity War Realm was radiating a powerful aura. Looking at Lin Yun coldly, the leader continued, “The prestige of the war realms cannot be defiled. You, imbecile, have committed a grave mistake!”

“Imbecile? You must be referring to yourself,” mocked Lin Yun, which enraged the leader.

Lin Yun had comprehended the essence of the sun and moon, so his eyesight had grown. The runes in the aura oceans of the people in front of him were planted with a secret technique. Then, they were tempered with treasures to nourish their aura oceans. Although there was no way those runes could be compared to the Demonic Astral Flowers in his aura oceans, it gave the war realms a great advantage against all others.

“Those who dare to defile the prestige of the war realms will be killed!” The leader said coldly, “Tuo Hai, go and take his life!”

“Yes!” The gray-clothed youth who was named Tuo Hai nodded his head. The rage in his pupils disappeared as he calmed down. His actions made Pei Xue wary.

“Don’t be rash. We need to leave before Beast King Nie Xuan comes,” whispered Pei Xue.

“You guys think you guys can leave?” Tuo Hai charged over in a black light that made him look like a comet. He had cultivated a cultivation technique called the Myriad Comet Art, a trump card from the Nether Divinity War Realm to reign in the Heavenly Path.

“Kneel!” Tuo Hai roared and arrived before Lin Yun as the black light formed an ancient seal. Watching this scene, the leader and his companions smiled with disdain because Tuo Hai was using the Nether Divinity War Realm’s secret technique, the Star Shattering Palm. It was so powerful that it could make a monarch demonic beast submit.

They were confident that someone like Lin Yun had never seen a secret technique of this level since he allowed Tuo Hai to get close to him. With that, Lin Yun had no other option but to beg for his life. It might be brutal, but this was the consequence of humiliating the Nether Divinity War Realm.

Right at this moment, boundless silver moonlight exploded from Lin Yun’s body. Tuo Hai, who was above Lin Yun, was instantly devoured by the moonlight and discovered in fear that his aura had been completely suppressed. The situation was so bad for him that he couldn’t even bring out his martial intent.

Lin Yun was clearly before him, but Tuo Hai felt as though Lin Yun was far away. At this moment, a seal bloomed when Lin Yun joined his hands together and pushed his hands out, “Moon Aroma!”

The bright moon hung high in the sky as the fragrance of a flower spread out. When the ancient moon radiated in the sky, countless petals drifted down. Tuo Hai felt as though he was grasped by a gigantic hand and fell down, kneeling before Lin Yun.

When Tuo Hai fell to the ground, his bones shattered as he released a painful howl. Looking at this scene, the Nether Divinity War Realm were dumbfounded. “H-how is this possible?!”

In their eyes, Tuo Hai was about to unleash his prowess. How could he kneel just like that?

“Hmmm? Aren’t you a genius from the high and aloof war realm? Weren’t you just about to kill me? Why are you kneeling before me all of a sudden? How can I possibly accept this honor from someone as noble as you?” Lin Yun sneered.

“You bastard, kill me if you dare!” Tuo Hai was filled with grievance because he couldn’t get back on his feet no matter how hard he tried. When he was done speaking, he flew into the air with a punch imprinted on his chest. The center of attack was blooming with an ancient seal that had a silver phoenix that emitted an ancient and noble aura.

“No…” Tuo Hai was overwhelmed with fear as he felt death approaching. In the next second, his body blew into pieces. In the place where he died, five runes that were dyed in blood soared into the sky. Then, they exploded like fireworks.

“Tuo Hai!” The gold-armored youth exclaimed. Everything happened too quickly, so he couldn’t react in time. At this moment, the Nether Divinity War Realm was furious. They were forbidden existences, so something like this was unprecedented. Even when the Profound Lightning Twin Swords lost to Lin Yun, Mo Xuan relied on his dao armor to survive.

“”Kill him!”” All of them roared as they exploded with boundless killing intent.

“How annoying.” Lin Yun was getting annoyed as he soared into the sky and executed the Soaring Lunar Grasp. When he flew into the sky, he raised his hand and pushed it out. In the next second, a massive moon appeared along with a giant hand.

When the palm descended, half of the party died as they turned into bloody mist. The power Lin Yun was releasing right now was terrifying. Clearly, the consumption of hundreds of Lunar Soul Herbs for the Divine Moon Breaking Seal brought the power of his Divine Glorymoon Fist to an unbelievable level.

Furthermore, he could use the sun and moon to increase the power of his fist technique. When Lin Yun threw out another attack, a light flashed in his mind as he gained deeper insight.

The Divine Solar Lunar Fist wasn’t like the Divine Glorysun Fist and Divine Glorymoon Fist techniques. After all, the current Divine Glorymoon Fist already exceeded its limits since Lin Yun was coming in contact with a holy spirit martial technique.

Pei Xue was full of disbelief. There was only one possibility, but she couldn’t believe it. Did Lin Yun grasp a holy spirit martial technique? How is this possible?

But if Lin Yun didn’t, then his strength didn’t make sense. But why else would Lin Yun risk his life to refine all those Lunar Soul Herbs for a simple Divine Glorymoon Fist. If it was just a fortune martial technique, it wouldn’t be worth it.

As howls sounded out in mid-air, the Never Divinity War Realm’s party was heavily injured. They were on their last leg, so they all executed their secret techniques and brought out their dao artifacts. None of them wanted to die.

But when Lin Yun raised his hand and pushed his palm down once more, the leader exclaimed in fear, “No, wait! Stop!”

But it was futile. All he could do was watch the hand descend from the sky as everyone’s bodies exploded. Everyone died before they could even let out a scream as the runes from their aura oceans soared into the sky and exploded.

Everything happened too quickly. The Nether Divinity War Realm clearly wasn’t ready for Lin Yun to be so ruthless. Today, the sky would be dyed with the blood of the Nether Divinity War Realm.

As golden light surged, the armored leader released a furious roar. Black flames blazed on the surface of his body as he charged towards Lin Yun. He was ready to use his trump card to take Lin Yun down.

He was already injured when Lin Yun attacked, so he was trying to take Lin Yun down with him. In reality, his efforts were futile because Lin Yun was simply too strong for him.

Divine Glorymoon Fist—Everlasting Moon.

Not only did this punch perfectly embody the Divine Moon Breaking Seal, but it also contained the power of the Divine Glorysun Fist, two sword sutras, power of the Azure Dragon True Bone’s divine rune, and his sky sword intent. With everything combined, Lin Yun’s attack was practically a holy spirit martial technique.

Although it was barely touching the realm of a holy spirit martial technique, it was unbelievably powerful. Just like that, the armored youth died before he could even take a step forward. He wanted to take Lin Yun down along with him, but he ultimately discovered that he couldn’t even make a move

Once everything was done, Lin Yun stood still in the moonlight. Not a single sign of life was left.
