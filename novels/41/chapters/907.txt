The sky was filled with phenomena. A golden crow soared through the sky, flowers bloomed, and people with gold wings were all linked drawn into one majestic painting. Based on the scale of the phenomena, it had to be the Glorysun Spirit.

When Lin Yun raised his head, he had to squint his eyes from the blinding light. The Glorysun and Glorymoon Spirits were known to be the strongest among the seven astral spirits. However, they were sealed. So aside from using them as a key to the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm, no one knew if they had any other uses.

“It seems to be a little far away. Without the phenomena, it would be impossible to find.”

Lin Yun wasn’t that interested in the Glorysun Spirit because his objective was the Gold Flowlight Flower and the treasures. Now that he had completed his two objectives, he had some time to take a look at the Glorysun Spirit. A light flashed through Lin Yun’s eyes because he knew that all the geniuses from the higher realms would be there.

“Well, there’s no need to be in a hurry. I might as well take a drink,” smiled Lin Yun. He wasn’t as anxious as the others about the Glorysun Spirit. He was even more interested in the Millennium Flame and the dragon clan wine that caused Chen Qiong and Xian Yunzhen to lose their composure.

It seemed like the Mo Clan was really mysterious. The dragon clan wines weren’t sealed by the Frost Jade Wine Pool, but with the Millennium Flame. Retrieving the wine pot that contained the flame, Lin Yun poured the wine into the purple crystal cup.

The wine looked like flaming blood in the cup and had a dreamy look to it.

Lin Yun examined the cup and noticed that there was something else in the wine because he could see fine little sparkles floating around. With a gentle sniff, the wine aroma entered his body as he closed his eyes in satisfaction.

Suddenly, the atmosphere was disrupted by a swallowing of saliva. When Lin Yun opened his eyes, he saw Lil’ Red staring at the cup with drool.

“You want some?” Lin Yun asked.

Lil’ Red nodded its head frantically. Fearing that Lin Yun might go back on his word, Lil’ Red quickly snatched the cup. When Lil’ Red took a sniff of the wine, it had satisfaction written all over its face. Then, it chugged the wine without hesitation.

Suddenly, Lil’ Red eyes bulged out. Before Lin Yun could react, golden flames blazed from Lil’ Red along with an indescribably violent aura. Under the terrifying aura, Lil’ Red turned back into its horse form uncontrollably.

Its mighty figure was covered with dragon scales that looked like war armor. Suddenly, it opened its mouth and roared, unleashing fire from its mouth that scorched the ground. The violent energy coursed through its body, forcing it to hop around. The group even trembled with each hop.

At this moment, a pair of dragon wings unfolded and flapped. By the time Lil’ Red used up the surge of energy, it would probably make a breakthrough into the Heavenly Soul Realm. This was all thanks to a little cup of wine.

“Was it that potent?” Lin Yun’s lips twitched with shock in his eyes. But when he calmed down a brief moment later, he muttered to himself, “There’s something strange about this wine.”

He had noticed something earlier, but he wasn’t sure. With Lil’ Red’s experience, he was able to tell that there was indeed something strange. If it wasn’t for Lil’ Red, he would have burned his body.

Pouring another cup for himself, Lin Yun looked at the wine and fell into deep thoughts. A brief moment later, the gold sparkles in the wine started to boil. Just when Lin Yun was feeling baffled, gold flames flew out from the wine that turned into a vivid golden crow. The crow circled Lin Yun before eventually dissipating. It was the same phenomenon Lin Yun had seen back in the Hidden Treasure Pavilion.

“I see…” Lin Yun's eyes flashed. He had to wait for the sparkles to leave the wine before drinking it. Otherwise, he would just end up like Lil’ Red. However, it should be fine for Lil’ Red since it had such a robust figure.

This wasn’t Lin Yun’s first time using Lil’ Red as a testing subject. Diverting his attention back to the wine, Lin Yun became very curious to find out what dragon clan wine tasted like.

Putting the cup to his lips, Lin Yun began to drink. The moment the wine entered his mouth, he sensed a chill spread throughout his body. It was almost as if his entire body had been dropped into ice, which stimulated him greatly. The chill was so great that Lin Yun couldn’t be bothered to recall how the wine tasted. But just when Lin Yun was about to forget the taste completely, it slowly came back.

The wine was like a gentle flame that coursed within his body. From his bones, internal organs, pores, and every single cell, the flame slowly expelled the chill that had entered his body.

The satisfaction made Lin Yun squint his eyes uncontrollably. Just like that, time slowly passed as Lin Yun’s body fought between fire and ice. It was a constant cycle of the cold being expelled while his body was cleansed by flames.

When Lin Yun recovered from the effects of the wine, he noticed that the aura ocean in his violet palace had doubled in size. The thirty thousand meters aura ocean had grown to sixty thousand meters. Even the Azure Firmament Tree in the aura ocean had become even more lively as the Iris Flower petals brimmed with vitality and starlight.

“The Millennium Flame’s reputation is completely justified,” muttered Lin Yun when he opened his eyes. His pearly white face had a rosy tint that looked bewitching under the blazing sunlight. When he examined his expanded aura ocean, he was shocked. A single cup of wine had brought him to the greater Heavenly Soul Realm.

Now that he had reached the greater Heavenly Soul Realm, he was only one step away from facing his first tribulation.

“This wine is spectacular. I wonder who brewed it,” muttered Lin Yun. He could sense that his cultivation was firm and consolidated. Then again, the effects enhanced because this was his first cup. If he drank another cup, the effects wouldn’t be so great.

Lin Yun made up his mind to thank the Mo Clan if they had any successors in the Kunlun Realm. Slowly standing up, Lin Yun staggered and nearly over from his buzz.

“What strong wine.” Lin Yun lamented. If it wasn’t for the Glorysun Spirit, he would want to drown himself in wine. The Millennium Flame was too strong, so Lin Yun wasn’t able to walk straight. He ended up having to use his sword intent to suppress the intoxication in his body.

While Lin Yun was drinking wine, Flamefeather City had boiled over with excitement.

“The Glorysun Spirit has finally emerged. How spectacular.”

“The scale of these phenomena is a little terrifying. It’s a pity that the Glorysun Spirit is sealed. Otherwise, who knows how powerful it would be.”

“Let’s go and take a look. Even if we can’t get the Glorysun Spirit, there will definitely be other treasures that come with it.” In the next second, all the cultivators in the city charged towards the direction of the phenomena.
