Chapter 1932 - Divine Firefly Sword

Looking at the youthful Ye Qingtian, Ren Tong enviously sighed, “I really envy youngsters like you.”

Lin Yun didn’t want to say a word, but Ren Tong’s sigh had strummed a particular string in his heart. He spoke out, “Hold it right there.”

“What’s the matter? You want to humiliate me even though I have admitted defeat?” Ren Tong turned around and looked at Ye Qingtian with his brows furrowed. This was because Ye Qingtian didn’t have a good reputation within the sect.

But Lin Yun shook his head and replied, “In my eyes, a swordsman has nothing to do with their age. We should pursue our goals regardless of age; a man is still youthful even after he dies!”

That was what he thought and did. Lin Yun was young but experienced more life and death experience than the old man. So the blood in his heart was still as boiling as before.

Ren Tong initially thought that Ye Qingtian wanted to humiliate him, but he was stumped after hearing what Ye Qingtian said. Not only that, but many people were shocked when they heard what Ye Qingtian said because it didn’t sound like something that Ye Qingtian would say. But for some reason, they could feel their hearts boiling when they heard him.

Chen Feng was also stumped, wondering if this was still the same senior brother as before. When he looked at Ye Qingtian, who was donned a white robe, he felt that Ye Qingtian’s figure seemed like a mountain in his eyes.

“This is Senior Brother Ye? It looks like he has undergone a drastic transformation after changing…”

“Ye Qingtian is really dashing!”

“It’s no wonder why he can receive the attention of two holy maidens. So he really has changed.” The female disciples all looked at Ye Qingtian with their eyes shining brightly and faces blushing.

On the other hand, Zhang Yue and Ye Feifan’s faces were ugly. Zhang Yue commented, “He really knows how to put on an act.”

“Let’s see how he’ll fair, then!” Ye Feifan said coldly.

“Thank you for your teachings.” Ren Tong bowed and left the stage.

Lin Yun didn’t take long to obtain nine victories in a row, with the entire group being swept up by Lin Yun. His profound sword techniques, cool demeanor, and words had subdued everyone present.

Those who lost wore bitter expressions because they initially thought Ye Qingtian was an easy opponent, but that wasn’t the case. Despite feeling bitter, they were fully convinced by their loss.

Four hours later, the other nine groups also concluded, and everyone with the ‘0’ medal maintained their positions as they stood on the reunited stage. All the inner and saint disciples held their breaths as they watched because they knew the finals were starting.

None of the ten on the stage were pushovers, and the competition would definitely be intense. Everyone initially thought Wang Muyan could become the champion, but they weren’t that confident now.

Even the Saint Elders’ faces had become tense, especially the Nether Slaughtering Saint Sovereign and Dragon Origin Great Saint. On the other hand, the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint maintained her composure.

Quasi-Saint Chi Yun descended from the sky and glanced over the ten. He said, “I have to congratulate everyone for making it into the top ten, and the battle for the Ranking Battle begins.”

This meant everyone would compete for the championship because the other rankings were ordinary, which was a cruel reality. Only the champion would be remembered by everyone. Geniuses were all prideful, and the other rankings were no different from humiliation.

“The rules are the same as always; whoever stands out will be the ‘0’ candidate. He can choose to challenge one by one or challenge several people simultaneously,” Chi Yun said. “The treatment for the ‘0’ candidate is the same, and he’s allowed to fail once while everyone else will be eliminated if they are defeated.”

But none of the top ten moved after hearing that, and even Wang Muyan didn’t seem interested. Zhang Yue, Ye Feifan, and the others also didn’t make a move. This was because the treatment of the ‘0’ candidate wasn’t captivating to them because losing once or twice didn’t make a difference. They didn’t stand out because they weren’t confident they could preserve their trump cards.

“Since no one wants to stand out, we’ll determine the ‘0’ candidate by lots,” Chi Yun said, and he wasn’t surprised by this scene.

“Let me be the ‘0’ candidate.” When Chi Yun wanted everyone to draw lots, Ye Qingtian quickly stood out.

This made everyone briefly stunned before they couldn’t help smiling.

On the Heavenly Dao Altar, the Nether Slaughtering Saint Sovereign smiled, “He’s really is as the Dragon Origin Great Saint said; he still hasn’t changed his cockiness. It’s easy for him to fall if he maintains his cockiness!”

The Dragon Origin Great Saint was already cursing inwardly. Still, he maintained his composure on the surface and smiled, “With the strength of my disciple, it’s hard even if he wanted to maintain a low profile. Nether Slaughtering Saint Sovereign, you don’t know the outcome!”

The Nether Slaughtering Saint Sovereign awkwardly smiled after hearing that, and he wanted to see if the Dragon Origin Great Saint could still smile later.

“Wang Yue, come on!” Lin Yun called out to Wang Yue, picking him as his first opponent.

Wang Yue’s face changed, and he wasn’t too willing. After all, he already lost to Ye Qingtian once and initially thought about taking revenge after returning from the Loser Group. But he wasn’t that willing anymore after being called out by Ye Qingtian. He didn’t want to fight Ye Qingtian so quickly, this caused him to cower.

On the contrary, Lin Yun smiled, “Wang Yue, have you found a way to break through my sword technique?”

“Why don’t you take a guess?” Wang Yue asked indifferently. He already figured out a way back then. He was looking forward to facing Ye Qingtian’s Profound Thunder Sword Technique again and surprising the latter.

“Blooming Nether Orchid!” Wang Yue repeated and executed the Nether Orchid Sword Technique once more.

“This move again…” Lin Yun smiled. He wasn’t used to it before, but didn’t need to treat it seriously now. With a wave of his hand, Netherflowers appeared on the ground with a death aura spreading out.

The petals of the Netherflowers and Nether Orchids turned into two tornadoes that charged at each other along with their swords. One was filled with death aura while the other was brimming life force with their sword intents empowering their attacks.

After a few breaths, the tornadoes reached a hundred feet, making everyone’s hearts tremble. This was a confrontation between death and life. When the two tornadoes clashed, they created a considerable commotion with petals flying around. The two tornadoes gradually fused with thunder rumbling in the sky.

Lin Yun and Wang Yue both disappeared, before they clashed above the tornadoes with a powerful gale flashing with sparks flying around.

“Firefly Radiance!”Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Firefly Radiance!” The two executed the Divine Firefly Sword, and the first layer of heaven shattered with starlight raining down when their swords clashed. When they clashed, a powerful sword aura swept out from them.

“Dawn Radiance!”

“Sunset Radiance!”

“Waning Moon!”

“Heavenly Snowing Mountain!” Lin Yun and Wang Yue began to execute the Divine Firefly Sword, clashing together. This shocked everyone because they didn’t expect that Wang Yue would also know the Divine Firefly Sword.

When they clashed, the two tornadoes also fused. When life and death merged, they formed a thousand-foot high tornado that tore apart the surroundings. The powerful gales made their clothes violently flutter, and when they swung their swords, they executed the Divine Firefly Sword—Silver Blood.

Two silver starry skies appeared behind them, and a crimson radiance shone on their swords. When their swords clashed, the tornado was torn apart.

When Ye Qingtian and Wang Yue descended, Wang Yue gasped for his breath with disbelief filled in his pupils. The Divine Firefly Sword was a trump card he had hidden, and he initially planned to catch Ye Qingtian by surprise. But he didn’t expect that he would fail, and even his Life Intent failed to suppress Ye Qingtian.

On the other hand, Lin Yun merely stood with his sword, looking at the petals flying around as though he was enjoying the beautiful scenery. Then again, the scenery was beautiful as Lin Yun stood in the petals.

Wang Yue was unwilling, but he gritted his teeth and summoned his constellation. A scarlet dragon enveloped in flames appeared when the painting unfolded, releasing a powerful dragon aura. When the dragon aura swept out, Wang Yue’s aura rose with cracks spreading on the ground.

“The Scarlet True Dragon!”

“Senior Brother Wang’s constellation is a little terrifying. Even the power of a Quasi-Saint’s constellation isn’t this powerful.”

“I heard the Wang Clan especially gave him dragon blood to cultivate this constellation, and this is his trump card.”

“Ye Qingtian hasn’t brought out his constellation, and it won’t be easy for him.” Everyone looked at the scarlet dragon and exclaimed with fear filling their pupils.

On the contrary, Wang Yue restored his confidence and said, “Ye Qingtian, bring out your constellation!”

“As you wish.” Lin Yun did not intend to hide it, and he smiled as a painting flew out of his body. The painting seemed ordinary, but it made everyone’s faces change when the painting unfolded.

“How is this possible?!” Everyone looked at Ye Qingtian’s constellation with disbelief because Ye Qingtian’s constellation was the Primordial Kunpeng!
