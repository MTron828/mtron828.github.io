Chapter 1036 - An Invitation

Together with Lil’ Red, the two left the courtyard and started strolling through the city. In an hour, they arrived at the center of the plaza where the ranking list was located. It was one of the few places in the city where fighting was forbidden and only sparring was allowed.

Raising his head, Lin Yun saw a massive lake at the center of the plaza that contained an astronomical amount of astral energy. Many people sat on the lake to cultivate.

Lin Yun swept his glance around and saw a massive mirror enveloped in a faint mist. Occasionally, the mirror would shine with white, purple, or golden light, which represented the names of the geniuses on the ranking.

“The Heavenly Path Mirror!” Lin Yun said when he sensed the terrifying aura coming from the gigantic mirror. He heard many rumors about the mirror, so he instantly recognized it.

“This isn’t the genuine Heavenly Path Mirror, but a projection of the genuine one. However, you can still see the names on the mirror. You can also see that the threshold for making the ranking is the fourth soul Heavenly Soul Realm,” said Pei Xue.

The mirror judged everyone based on their strength. If someone concealed their true strength and trump cards, then their strength would be underestimated. The mirror could only see to a certain extent. As it got closer to the final battle, the rankings would become more accurate.

Most importantly, only those on the ranking were qualified to bask in the Saint Spiritual Lake. Lin Yun was only in the third soul Heavenly Soul Realm, so he didn’t qualify for the ranking. It didn’t even matter that his true strength was comparable to the fifth soul Heavenly Soul Realm.

“The colors represent the different categories. Those in the golden names are the strongest cultivators. There are a total of 18 spots which were taken by the Ten War Realms,” explained Pei Xue.

When Lin Yun raised his head to look at the golden names, they shined brighter than any other name. However, they were few in number.

“There has been a huge fluctuation in the ranking recently with many hidden geniuses appearing. One person even made it into the gold ranking. Everyone here is cultivating to make it onto the gold ranking,” said Pei Xue.

The two chatted while they walked and Lin Yun even discovered many people trying to make a breakthrough on the lake. With the final battle approaching, many people couldn’t stay hidden. Some people weren’t even trying to aim for the final ranking, they simply wanted to bask in the Saint Spiritual Lake.

The Saint Spiritual Lake had an extraordinary origin, and it was the last opportunity in the Heavenly Path. If one missed it, they would be lacking compared to the others.

“What ranking are you in?” Lin Yun asked curiously. He knew that Pei Xue reached the fourth soul Heavenly Soul Realm a long time ago. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“I’m number 36 on the purple ranking.”

“You’re only number 36?”

“The competition is intense and those in the top ten are practically in the fifth soul Heavenly Soul Realm. They even have a chance to make it into the top ten for the final battle because no one knows what trump cards they’re hiding.” Pei Xue said in a grave tone and continued, “Especially recently.”

Lin Yun looked at Pei Xue and could sense a terrifying power sealed within Pei Xue’s body. Clearly, Pei Xue had more secrets on her besides the Divine Blood Fruit.

“Don’t look at me like that. I’ll be doomed if that little lover of yours finds out about this!” Pei Xue chuckled while she rejoiced inwardly. She was confident in her appearance and was happy that Lin Yun was concerned about her.

“Yue Weiwei isn’t my lover,” replied Lin Yun calmly.

“Are you sure? Who is she to you then?” Pei Xue was shocked and her heart began to throb at the same time while her face blushed.

Lin Yun pondered briefly and replied, “She calls me Big Brother Yun, so I guess she’s a younger sister of mine. We’re just close. She’s very important to me and I gave her my promise that her enemies will be my enemies no matter who they are.”

How is she not your lover then, you pig?! Pei Xue’s heart collapsed and all her thoughts from earlier crumbled.

Suddenly, a commotion broke out in the plaza, causing many people who were cultivating to open their eyes. At this moment, they could sense an extremely powerful aura as a few people had arrived. That powerful aura came from a youth who made no attempts to conceal his aura.

There are many people like him recently. With the final battle approaching, no one wanted to hide. They were determined to shine brightly and attract the attention of the powerful sects.

“That’s He Qianfan! Didn’t he leave Four Phase City? Why did he come back?”

“He Qianfan? Who is he?”

“Are you stupid? Look at the ninth spot on the purple ranking!”

“It’s him! He’s a genius who appeared out of nowhere about a month ago. He actually reached the fifth soul Heavenly Soul Realm.” A commotion broke out in the plaza while many people looked at He Qianfan with shock.

He was a ruthless person who used to be nameless. He went through two tribulations in a row after arriving in Four Phase City. It nearly shocked the entire city. There were even rumors that the experts of the powerful sects were alarmed by his breakthrough. Apparently, he obtained a heaven-defying inheritance in the Black Tortoise Region and obtained all the fortune there.

More and more geniuses were appearing on the Heavenly Path Ranking. Until now, there weren’t many people who could be compared to He Qianfan. Most importantly, he left the city half a month ago. So his sudden appearance naturally piqued many people’s curiosity.

Lin Yun and Pei Xue were also surprised because they were only here to take a look. However, they could sense that something wasn’t right when He Qianfan’s party walked towards Lin Yun. It didn’t take long for He Qianfan’s party to arrive before Lin Yun as the former squinted his eyes to examine Lin Yun.

Instantly, everyone became curious about Lin Yun’s identity.

“Lin Yun, I was tasked by someone to give you an invitation.” He Qianfan grinned with a loud voice that spread throughout the plaza. The crowd broke into an uproar because everyone had heard of Lin Yun’s name by now.

He had thoroughly embarrassed the Divine Nether, Elysium Trigram, and Profound Dragon War Realm all by himself. It caused his name to spread throughout the city.

When Lin Yun heard that He Qianfan had an invitation for him, he replied calmly, “I don’t know you.”

“It doesn’t matter. I know you. Flower Burial Lin Yun, you’re the one who bathed three war realms in blood. That’s you, right? If so, then I found the right person. I was tasked by someone to give you this invitation personally!” He Qianfan revealed a playful smile. He was looking forward to seeing how Lin Yun would react upon knowing the truth behind the invitation.

His words also instantly attracted everyone’s attention. After all, He Qianfan was someone who made two breakthroughs in a row and occupied the ninth position on the purple ranking. Now that one month had passed, the aura he was giving off became even more terrifying.

He was already so strong, so who could have tasked him to give Lin Yun an invitation? Suddenly, Pei Xue smiled, “An invitation? You can just give it to me.”

But without any signs, He Qianfan slapped his palm into Pei Xue’s shoulder, causing a terrifying aura to explode out. In a brief moment, he manifested the hand of an ancient beast that shattered space.

When the palm landed on Pei Xue’s shoulder, she threw up a mouthful of blood and was sent flying. Everything took place too quickly, which caused the surroundings to look at He Qianfan with shock.

“Woman, didn’t I say that this invitation was meant for Lin Yun? Why don’t you get lost? If you don’t, I’m worried that I might accidentally kill a piece of trash like you. It will be troublesome for me because no one is allowed to kill in Four Phase City,” chuckled He Qianfan. There was no change in his smile except for the fact that his smile became eerier.

“Are you alright?” Lin Yun helped Pei Xue back on her feet and noticed that her injuries were pretty serious.

“Don’t worry about me. That invitation might be very important,” said Pei Xue with a pale face.

“Sorry, but I’ve changed my mind now.” He Qianfan chuckled with a playful gaze. “Lin Yun, I’ll give you the invitation if you can take a palm from me. Otherwise, I don’t think you’re qualified to go.”
