Chapter 2184 - Heavenly Dao Oath

There was an uproar in the surrounding area after hearing what the Tough Peak Saint Sovereign said. Ye Qingtian isn’t Ye Qingtian, but is Lin Yun in disguise?

Everyone was shocked, and no one would believe it if someone else said it.

But it was different since it came from the Tough Peak Saint Sovereign. He was the ancestor of the Ye Clan, having lived for a thousand years, and he was the actual controller of the Ye Clan. He naturally had the qualification to say that; however, if anyone but the Tough Peak Saint Sovreign said that, no one would believe them.

“How dare you!” The Thousand Plume Great Saint was furious, releasing his aura, as he coldly said, “Tough Peak Saint Sovereign, this is the Heavenly Dao Sect, not your Ye Clan. The sect’s rules are ahead of the clan’s rules. Who are you to say if he’s Ye Qingtian or not. Get lost or don’t blame me for not being polite!”

Everyone took a deep breath as they sensed the murderous intent radiating from the Thousand Plume Great Saint. It was rare to see a Great Saint so furious.

As for Tough Peak Saint Sovereign, his face had become pale with rage on his face. He was so furious that he nearly threw out blood. In terms of seniority, the Thousand Plume Great Saint was considered part of his grandchildren’s generation, so since when would a grandson reprimand their grandfather?

He was furious, not to mention that if Ye Qianyu was willing to heed his words, the Ye Clan wouldn’t be suppressed by the Wang Clan now. As the old and new grudges combined, the Tough Peak Saint Sovereign was so furious that he nearly flared up on the spot.

But facing Ye Qianyu’s gaze, the Tough Peak Saint Sovereign was afraid because Ye Qingyu wasn’t someone he could provoke. Regardless of strength or status, he was far behind Ye Qingyu.

“You can’t put it that way,” the Gale Rein Great Saint stood out with a smile. “Since the Tough Peak Saint Sovereign has already spoken, let him finish.”Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

He wore a smile, ignoring the Thousand Plume Great Saint’s gaze, and continued, “Tough Peak Saint Sovereign, since you dare say that, I believe you have your reasons for doing so, right?”

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint, Serene Dust Great Saint, and Dragon Origin Great Saint looked at each other, but they didn’t know what to do now. The Thousand Plume Great Saint initially wanted Lin Yun to give it a try and see if he could bring the Emperor Sword back, but this pushed Lin Yun to the edge of the cliff instead.

The Tough Peak Saint Sovereign coldly said, “I naturally have my reasons in saying that. Ye Qingyu, let me confront him if you’re not guilty!”

A discussion broke out from the surroundings as everyone had shock in their eyes. If this was normal, it would be suppressed. But there were guests from the other holy lands, so this placed the Thousand Plume Great Saint in a tough spot.

“Isn’t it a little ridiculous for Ye Qingtian to be Flower Burial?”

“Well, they do share some similarities. How can there be so many prodigy swordsmen? Ye Qingtian returned to the sect a year ago, and Flower Burial went missing about the same time.”

“There were people who suspected his identity, but there wasn’t any proof. Then again, the words from the ancestor of the Ye Clan holds some weight.”

“Just let them confront.”

But there were also those who found it ridiculous, “Isn’t this too ridiculous? How can Flower Burial and Ye Qingtian possibly be the same person? There’s nothing similar about them aside from the fact that they were swordsmen. Ye Qingtian is the Holy Maiden Killer, while Flower Burial wouldn’t do something like that.”

As the surrounding discussion became louder, the cloaked person smiled, “This is getting interesting now…”

Those who stood behind him also playfully looked at Ye Qingtian. If Ye Qingtian was Lin Yun, the Firmament Saint Cloth would be on him. Sword Emperor Yu Qingfeng might’ve said that no Emperors were allowed to go after it, but he didn’t say that Saints weren’t allowed to go after it.

No one would dare to touch Lin Yun if the Radiant Sword Saint was at his prime, but the Radiant Sword Saint’s tribulation was arriving, and it was unsure if he could make it out. So how could the Radiant Sword Saint take care of his disciple? Then again, that was under the prerequisite that Ye Qingtian was Lin Yun.

Seeing that it wasn’t a solution for the stalemate to carry on, the Thousand Plume Great Saint said, “Tough Peak Saint Sovereign, you can confront him. But I advise you to have evidence to back up what you say. Otherwise, I won’t spare you!”

“Are you threatening me? Others might fear you, but I don’t. The real Ye Qingtian is dead, and he’s definitely not Ye Qingtian. Let me prove it to you then! Ye Qingtian, do you dare to take the Heavenly Dao Oath that you’re not Flower Burial?” The Tough Peak Saint Sovereign sneered.

The Heavenly Dao Oath was special, and even demonic cultivators didn’t dare to go against it. After all, Heavenly Dao did exist, so the oath couldn’t be taken lightly.

The Tough Peak Saint Sovereign’s words made everyone shaken. That was the best way to prove it, and Ye Qingtian could take the oath if he wasn’t Flower Burial. This was an oath that everyone present could make.

Lin Yun looked at the Tough Peak Saint Sovereign, and said, “Sure, but you have to take an oath before me.”

He looked relaxed, then he continued, “I’m curious as to how I am dead in your mouth. Since you’re so certain, you can take the Heavenly Dao Oath and say that Ye Qingtian is already dead. If he’s still alive, you will suffer the backlash of your oath, and you will never be able to make a breakthrough in your lifetime.”

Seeing how calm Lin Yun was, everyone began to doubt again. After all, Ye Qingtian’s acting skills would be a little too superb if he was really Lin Yun. There was nothing wrong with what he said either, and casually taking the Heavenly Dao Oath was an act of disrespect to Heavenly Dao.

“I…” The Tough Peak Saint Sovereign began to cower after seeing how calm and composed Ye Qingtian was. The latter didn’t look to be pressured at all. Even if there was one-thousandth chance that Ye Qingtian was really Lin Yun, the Tough Peak Saint Sovereign couldn’t afford to take the gamble. After all, he wasn’t absolutely certain that Ye Qingtian was dead.

“What’s the matter? You don’t dare?” Lin Yun smiled.

The Tough Peak Saint Sovereign turned to look at the Gale Rein Great Saint because the oath was a little too vicious. He didn’t have much life span left, and he would run out of lifespan if he couldn’t become a Great Saint within a hundred years. Lin Yun struck right at his weakness, knowing that the Tough Peak Great Saint would cower.

The Gale Rein Great Saint nodded, signaling to the Tough Peak Saint Sovereign that he could agree with Lin Yun’s terms, and this instantly made the latter’s face become ugly.

Zhao Tianyu already told the Gale Rein Great Saint that Ye Qingtian was Flower Burial. This was why he came up with this plan to reveal Lin Yun’s identity. But he never expected that Lin Yun would counterattack with a checkmate.

Seeing that the Tough Peak Saint Sovereign’s face becoming ugly, everyone in the surroundings began to doubt what he said earlier. As the Tough Peak Saint Sovereign’s face changed, he gritted his teeth, and said, “Ye Qingtian might not be dead, but you’re…”

Lin Yun sneered as he interrupted, “I’m standing before you, so Ye Qingtian is naturally not dead. Old goat, are you jealous of me?”

“You!” The Tough Peak Saint Sovereign was furious after being called an old goat, and roared, “How dare you! Since you say that you’re Ye Qingtian, who’s the birth parents of Ye Qingtian along with the name of his grandfather? Tell me!”

Lin Yun smiled as he smoothly replied after a brief consideration. This was because he had memorized the information that Ye Guhan gave him, so he smoothly replied without pause. Those who doubted him earlier changed their minds again because Ye Qingtian didn’t seem to be acting. But only a few who knew about Lin Yun’s identity heaved a sigh of relief.

Ji Zixi blinked her eyes with surprise. She really had to give it to Lin Yun’s composure to bear so much pressure. On the contrary, the Tough Peak Saint Sovereign lost his composure after being called an old goat.

Listening to Lin Yun’s reply, the Tough Peak Saint Sovereign became nervous, and his face gradually became ugly. Even the Saints of the Heavenly Dao Sect began to discuss amongst themselves and looked at the Tough Peak Saint Sovereign with doubt.

“He’s Lin Yun, and I can prove it. As long as I make a move against him, I can force him to reveal himself with one move,” the Tough Peak Saint Sovereign said, having no other choices left.

“Give it a try, if you dare!” The Dragon Origin Great Saint was furious. He roared, “If you dare to touch my disciple, I’ll butcher all the younger generations of your Ye Clan!”

Everyone took in a deep breath with their faces changed after listening to the Dragon Origin Great Saint’s threats. At the same time, the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint and Serene Dust Great Saint turned to look at the Tough Peak Saint Sovereign, making the latter feel his scalp going numb from the great pressure that he was feeling.

The guests from the other holy lands were surprised when they saw this scene of having so many Great Saints in the Heavenly Dao Sect backing one person up. Even if he was Lin Yun, one would have to consider well about touching him with three Great Saints behind him.

The Tough Peak Saint Sovereign knew that he had a slip of the tongue, and said, “It’s inappropriate for me to make a move. Zen Peak, come out! With Zen Peak making a move, he can force Ye Qingtian to show his true identity within ten moves!”

Zen Peak was a Quasi-Saint from the Ye Clan with a cultivation at the second stage of the Heavenly Origin Phase, reaching the Saint Soul Stage. Once he stood out, the Thousand Plume Great Saint frowned and wanted to stop it.

“Let him come. I’m not afraid.” Lin Yun nodded at the Thousand Plume Great Saint. He knew that he had to bring out some of his strength if he wanted to smoothly make it through this ordeal or it would become endless.

“That’s what you said! Zen Peak, why aren’t you making a move!” The Tough Peak Saint Sovereign said, rejoicing.

The guests from the other holy lands were shocked because Zen Peak was a Quasi-Saint at the second stage of the Heavenly Origin Phase, and even someone at the pinnacle of the Indigo Origin Phase couldn’t withstand three of his attacks.

So even if Ye Qingtian was strong, his cultivation was only at the high phase of the Indigo Origin Phase, so how could he possibly stop the Zen Peak Quasi-Saint.

With a woosh, Zen Peak Quasi-Saint came onto the stage with firm steps, and heavenly screens would appear behind with every step, soon coming to thirty-six layers. An ancient ‘fire’ word appeared when the heavenly screens overlapped, and the aura he gave off was even stronger than Wang Zai.

When he stopped, a constellation opened up behind him. It was a flaming volcano, with dragon roars coming from the summit and lightning flashing. Before they even fought, Zen Peak Quasi-Saint already gave off a powerful pressure that’d been accumulating after cultivating for two hundred years.

Zen Peak Quasi-Saint said, “It’s inappropriate for me to make a move against you based on my age. So let’s settle this within three moves. If I can’t force you to reveal yourself after three moves, consider it my loss.”
