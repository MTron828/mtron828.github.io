Chapter 1194 - Sky Sword Eye

On the stage, Lin Yun and Gongsun Yan stood face to face, but they weren’t in a hurry to fight. In any fight, the one who made the first move would affect the outcome of the battle more.

If one was confident enough, attacking second would be more beneficial after seeing the flaw in the opponent’s move. However, if one couldn’t find the flaw, they would lose the initiative.

However, fights were dependent on one’s wit. It was the reason why some swordsmen were evenly matched with their opponents but still couldn’t win. Coincidentally, Lin Yun and Gongsun Yan were both confident in themselves.

They both felt that they could see through the flaws of their opponent and they weren’t afraid that their opponent would take the lead in the fight. So thirty minutes had passed in the blink of an eye without anyone making a move. Gongsun Yan was calm and composed with a faint smile on his face. He was confident that his eyes could see through his opponents’ attacks, not to mention that Lin Yun had revealed most of his trump cards in his fight with Zhao Yan.

Just when everyone felt that Gongsun Yan would wait, his eyes suddenly became sharp and he took a step forward. Pouring his origin energy into both feet, he teleported in front of Lin Yun.

His speed shocked many people as he stabbed Lin Yun before anyone could react. However, a metallic collision sounded out as the sword hit Lin Yun’s chest. Only after seeing the sparks fly in the air did the crowd realize that Gongsun Yan attacked an afterimage. Lin Yun had shifted his body two inches and blocked Gongsun Yan’s attack with the Flower Burial Sword.

The fight between Lin Yun and Gongsun Yan was too fast, so not many people could follow with their eyes. They were only able to catch the tail end of the second and third move.

When the two swords clashed once more on the stage, sparks flew everywhere. At the same time, Lin Yun flicked a dazzling light at Gongsun Yan after flowers appeared behind him. Flicking Divine Finger!

“Void Shattering Finger!” Gongsun Yan also formed a seal with his left hand before he pointed his finger out. When the attacks collided and exploded, both of them stepped back and began attacking once more.

“Soaring Twin Dragons!” Gongsun Yan shook his wrist and unleashed two dragons. He summoned a wind and water dragon that flew towards Lin Yun.

In the blink of an eye, Gongsun Yan’s sword circled around Lin Yun 81 times. The entire sky was filled with dragons, sword rays, wind, water, and sword hums. All of this came from Gongsun Yan’s profound sword technique that actually surprised Lin Yun. In fact, Lin Yun chose to avoid the attack.

“Soaring Dragon Pack!” Gongsun Yan soared into the sky and stabbed his sword out, unleashing a pack of dragons that charged at Lin Yun. Lin Yun simply stomped his foot on the ground to retreat, but Gongsun Yan followed him with a finger pointed at the sky, “You think you can run?”

“Sun Concealing Clouds!” Lin Yun briefly paused before he executed the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords. In his hand, the Flower Burial Sword drew a full moon in the sky as the surroundings became dark.

“There’s no way you can block my attack,” smiled Gongsun Yan. As sparks flew, Lin Yun was sent a few hundred meters out and then fell into the lake. However, Gongsun Yan didn’t let Lin Yun catch his breath and chased after him.

A golden light radiated around Lin Yun as he executed the Golden Crow Nine Transformations. Instead of retreating, he attacked with Storm Clouds and Wind.

As another Azure Bird flew out of his body, Lin Yun moved swiftly on the surface of the water while his hair fluttered violently in the wind. As he moved, Lin Yun unleashed countless sword rays with his sword that raised a wave of nearly 100 feet to devour Gongsun Yan.

“Break!” Gongsun Yan’s eyes shined as he looked for the flaw in Lin Yun’s attack. Then, he held his sword with both hands and slashed the wave, destroying the wave with a 10 feet wide sword ray. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Lin Yun was surprised because this was the first time someone had detected a flaw in his attack after his sword technique reached the manifestation stage. In fact, it had never happened with someone from the same generation as him. Lin Yun was forced to retreat as soon as this happened.

Turning around in the air, Lin Yun landed on the hilt of the gigantic sword and fell into deep thought. Previously, he heard that Gongsun Yan’s sword eyes could see through the sword technique of those in the same generation. It seemed like the rumors were true. He also heard that Gongsun Yan had six Demonic Astral Flowers in each of his aura oceans. So it was safe to say that Gongsun Yan was the strongest opponent that he had encountered so far in the Sword Assembly.

However, Lin Yun had the Aurora Dragon’s Eyes that could see the flaws of someone’s attack and the flaws in their physique. It should be a lot stronger than Gongsun Yan’s sword eyes, but he could only maintain it for a split second.

Such people were monstrous because they were difficult to fight against. In fact, Zhao Yan and the others would have been defeated by Gongsun Yan after one move. However, this wasn’t Lin Yun’s full strength.

They didn’t fight for too long, but they exchanged over 100 moves. However, Lin Yun landed on the gigantic sword and created a stalemate. At this moment, Gongsun Yan was standing at the top of the wave with a powerful gale appearing around him that could tear space apart.

Lin Yun could clearly sense that there were nine swords that merged with space and couldn’t be detected with the naked eyes. As the nine swords continued to move, Gongsun Yan’s gale could easily tear someone apart. Clearly, the swords were the reason why the Void Shattering Sword Art was powerful.

The sword technique created by the Sword Emperor was clearly difficult to deal with. Then again, Lin Yun was confident he could win regardless of Gongsun Yan’s trump cards. After all, he had the Aurora Dragon’s Eyes.

Lin Yun wasn’t sure what he should do yet. The Eight Ominous Soul Locking Array could be seen from this spot, and it would bring endless troubles if he revealed his biggest trump card.

“Brother Lin, are you feeling despair right now?” Gongsun Yan wore an apologetic smile. “Regardless of the Sky Sword Eye or the Void Shattering Sword Art, I’m only using what the Sword Emperor used when he was young. It might not be fair for you, but I have to win no matter what!”

“Dragon Soaring Through The Water!” After breaking Lin Yun’s attack, Gongsun Yan felt that it was time for him to end this battle. So he used his sword aura to charge at Lin Yun.

Lin Yun focused his attention as he looked at Gongsun Yan’s attack, but his eyes flashed with disappointment. He truly couldn’t see through the flaw of this attack. In the end, he decided to take the attack head-on and soared into the sky. Then, his sword aura devoured the surrounding clouds as he manifested a dragon, “Clouds Manifesting Dragon!”

As the dragons clashed, Lin Yun pushed his movement technique to the limit. He continuously stabbed at Gongsun Yan’s sword aura with the Flower Burial Sword, which made Gongsun Yan’s sword aura weaker. This surprised Gongsun Yan because he never expected that Lin Yun would be able to find so many of his flaws.

But Gongsun Yan soon calmed himself down, “Painting Dragon!”

His sword was extremely terrifying as it moved like a brush to tear Lin Yun’s attack apart. Like ink, the sword ray trapped Lin Yun’s sword aura in place. At the same time, the outline of a dragon appeared under his brushstroke, leaving just one more stroke to complete the dragon. All he needed to do was mimic a brushstroke on Lin Yun’s forehead.

Sensing how strong this sword was, Lin Yun swiftly retreated. He was covered in blood after getting trapped by Gongsun Yan’s sword aura. However, Gongsun Yan’s sword was like a shadow that chased after him, becoming more and more vivid.

At this moment, it looked like Lin Yun was the evil dragon that Gongsun Yan was trying to finish painting.
