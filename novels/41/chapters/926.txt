Chapter 927 - Kill!

Everyone knew who Yuan Hengitan was. So when Zhao Feng saw him, he couldn’t help but wonder why a genius on the Azure Dragon Ranking was here.Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

As for the other geniuses on the ship, their eyes were filled with horror. They instantly recognized the Bloodbone Realm, which made them sweat. After all, they were just talking about how strong Lin Yun was. It would be extremely bad if they overheard the discussions.

At this moment, everyone thought about the brutality of the higher realms.

They’re here? Lin Yun wasn’t surprised when he saw the geniuses from the Bloodbone Realm. In fact, they arrived much later than he thought they would.

As he examined them, he noticed that they were all in the second soul Heavenly Soul Realm. Essentially, they had three aura oceans because of their violet palace, which helped them suppress others.

There was no way that someone so ordinary like Zhao Feng could compare to those three. The Bloodbone Realm’s foundation was truly deep.

Lin Yun also noticed that Yuan Hengtian's aura was two times more refined than his companions. Even his gaze was colder than his companions.

Since everyone knew that Yuan Hengtian was on the Azure Dragon Ranking, they were terrified of the prospect of seeing his strength. Who in their right mind would want to offend such a strong figure? It was equivalent to walking past the gates of hell.

“This is the Bloodbone Realm’s affairs. If you aren’t part of it, you should get lost!” The skinny youth standing beside Yuan Hengtian barked at the crowd. His words relieved the crowd as they quietly backed off.

In just the blink of an eye, the crowded deck became empty, save for one person.

“Why are you still here?” The skinny youth looked at Lin Yun and asked with a playful smile.

But contrary to his expectations, Lin Yun smiled and rubbed his nose, “Why should I leave? I’ve been waiting for you guys for a while now. But you’re a bit slow… I guess the Bloodbone Realm isn’t that impressive after all.”

Lin Yun had been expecting the Bloodbone Realm to show up. He wanted to deal with them so he could peacefully go through his tribulation. Otherwise, they would disrupt him and cause him harm.

The skinny youth squinted his eyes and spoke coldly, “Lin Yun, you’re just as arrogant as rumoured!”

The name Lin Yun surprised everyone who had escaped from the ship. Lin Yun? Flower Burial Lin Yun? Why is he here? We were really on the same ship as him? The crowd couldn’t believe the sudden turn of events. Just a moment ago, they were discussing Lin Yun’s grudge with the Bloodbone Realm. Now, both parties were in front of them.

“That’s the famous Lin Yun who kills everyone with one sword?”

“He looks ordinary. Did he really kill three geniuses from the higher realms?”

“How can it be fake? Why else would the Bloodbone Realm dispatch such a huge formation?”

“This should be a good show.” Those who were spectating from afar became excited because they didn’t expect such entertainment after arriving at the Scarlet Ghost River.

Lin Yun faced the Bloodbone Realm on the top of the ship’s deck. However, he was only facing Yuan Hengtian. He sensed a faint threat coming from Yuan Hengtian that he hadn’t sensed before.

“Hand over the Glorysun Spirit and kneel. If you do that, I might consider leaving you with a complete corpse. There’s no way I’ll let you off after offending my Bloodbone Realm. You’re dead!” The skinny youth looked at Lin Yun coldly.

“Ma Yu, stop wasting time with him. There’s no way someone like him will beg for his life. Break his legs, tear off his mouth, and stab his eyes. He’ll submit after he sees how strong you are. You and Feng Wuji came from the same master, so I’ll leave him to you,” said Yuan Hengtian, full of pride.

“Don’t worry, Senior Brother Hengtian. Leave it to me!” The skinny youth named Ma Yu smiled and circulated all three of his aura oceans at the same time. Then, he charged towards Lin Yun. In the blink of an eye, he poured all of his origin energy into his fist and punched Lin Yun in the face.

His attack was so ferocious that even an ordinary genius in the second soul Heavenly Soul Realm would be in trouble. However, his punch wasn’t able to hit Lin Yun. When it was several inches away from Lin Yun’s face, a powerful sword aura suddenly stopped his punch.

Ma Yu was surprised by Lin Yun’s counter attack, so he changed his strategy and tried to grab Lin Yun.

“Bloodsun Radiance!” The dazzling radiance from his palm flew forward with enough power to crush a person’s head. In the face of this attack, Lin Yun’s azure-purple radiance showed signs of collapsing.

Ma Yu smiled when he saw this. So what if Lin Yun had spiritual sword intent? It was nothing before absolute strength. But before he knew it, Lin Yun’s crumbling sword aura gathered and knocked him backwards.

“The foundation of your cultivation is a little weak. It can’t even break through my sword aura,” said Lin Yun. Then, his immense spiritual sword intent casually spread throughout the sky and merged with his azure dragon sword aura into a colossal dragon.

Lin Yun’s words made Ma Yu’s face sink. Looking at the shocking phenomenon behind Lin Yun, Ma Yu suddenly realized how troublesome Lin Yun was. It was no wonder that Lin Yun killed Feng Wuji with one sword. After all, he was already having trouble against Lin Yun’s sword aura.

“Hmph, this is only the beginning. Bloodflame Demon Blade!” Ma Yu hacked down with his palm like a blade. A boundless crimson radiance erupted out of his hand that manifested into a massive blade ray that started to tear space apart.

“You’ll be helpless after I tear your sword aura apart!” Ma Yu sneered. He was right. If he could break through Lin Yun’s sword aura, Lin Yun wouldn’t be able to release his full strength even if he had a dao artifact. At that time, Lin Yun wouldn’t even be able to lift a finger.

At this moment, Lin Yun used his fingers to block Ma Yu’s attack. He instantly tore Ma Yu’s attack apart in a domineering and casual manner. Ma Yu was so shocked because Lin Yun’s azure dragon sword aura had come to life.

“NO!” A dangerous thought flashed in Ma Yu’s mind as he wanted to retreat. But before he could react, Lin Yun had reached out with his hand that felt like a sharp blade as his azure dragon came to life.

When the azure dragon sword aura was formed, it surged violently with Lin Yun’s hand. Ma Yu realized that he was trapped in Lin Yun’s sword aura and couldn’t break free no matter what he did. When Lin Yun’s azure dragon coiled around Ma Yu, he could hear his bones crack.

“Stop!” Yuan Hengtian’s face finally changed as he roared. But before he could move, Lin Yun had already clenched his fist.

They want to break my legs, tear off my mouth, and stab my eyes? Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly as he crushed Ma Yu’s head, splattering blood all over the ground.
