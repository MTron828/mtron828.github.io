Chapter 412 - The End

Bai Lixuan’s words not only shocked the princess and Guardian Plum, but even Qin Yu’s face had changed. Qin Yu was shocked that Bai Lixuan was making a decision on his behalf.

But Qin Yu soon understood the meaning behind it. Bai Lixuan might be respectful to him, but he was also someone who had his own opinion. On the other hand, Qin Yu had neglected the fact that Bai Lixuan possessed the Saint Physique.

It was pretty terrifying now that he thought about it. Bai Lixuan was a prideful person, so perhaps he had also looked down on Bai Lixuan. After all, Bai Lixuan was the only one who remained on the horse the moment Lin Yun appeared and that alone stated something.

Bai Lixuan’s action wasn’t only because of his confidence in his strength, but he had also seen that Qin Yu was in a difficult position. Qin Yu wasn’t confident in offending the Sword Firmament Pavilion and Bloomphoenix Princess without the Divine Guards.

So he had no reason to reject Bai Lixuan’s suggestion. Most importantly, even Qin Yu didn’t believe that Lin Yun could take a sword from Bai Lixuan in his current state. Hence, Qin Yu smiled, “He can represent me. If you can take an attack from Bai Lixuan and survive, you can take Xin Yan away. Guardian Plum, I have already left this matter to be resolved between the disciples of your sect. I believe that you no longer have any reasons to say anything else, right?”

At the same time, Qin Yu took a deep glance at Bai Lixuan. He couldn’t see through Bai Lixuan, but he was seen through by Bai Lixuan.

Bloomphoenix Princess also fell into deep thought on her carriage. What Qin Yu did was brilliant because he basically passed the ball back to Guardian Plum. Since this was between the disciples of the Sword Firmament Pavilion, there was no reason for Qin Yu or her to stay involved in this matter.

“Lixuan, you’re someone that I brought into the sect personally. Is there a need for us to come this far?” Guardian Plum sighed because he was placed in a difficult position.

“Guardian, I will never forget my identity as the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s disciple no matter what happens in the future and I will always owe you one.” Bai Lixuan began to emit a faint glow on his body that gave off an intimate and respectful feeling to others.

This was the sign of the Saint Physique that imperceptibly placed pressure on others. The Saint Physique was like a star in the sky that others could only look up at. Some people were born high up in the sky and they would shine even without doing anything. But Bai Lixuan was risking his life by defying heaven to shine brightly like a star by relying on his own effort. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Guardian Plum had difficulty making a decision because on the surface, Bai Lixuan was still a disciple of the Sword Firmament Pavilion. He might be close to the crown prince and there was a high possibility that he had joined the Azure Association, but he hadn’t done anything to harm the sect's interest.

But today, he wanted to force Lin Yun into a dead end. Guardian Plum had the guts to protect Lin Yun from the empire, but he was placed in a difficult position when it came to Bai Lixuan. After all, Bai Lixuan could be considered to be in the same generation as Lin Yun.

“Two tigers cannot be placed in the same forest and the Sword Firmament Pavilion can’t contain two monstrous geniuses. There aren’t enough resources, not to mention…” Bai Lixuan paused briefly, and he looked at Guardian Plum, “Lin Yun and I have a grudge from way back.”

“Cut the crap. I, Lin Yun, will take your attack. You’re right that the Sword Firmament Pavilion can’t contain two monstrous geniuses, nor do I wish to compete with you for that title. I only want to take Big Sister Xin Yan away today.” Everyone was surprised that Lin Yun accepted Bai Lixuan’s challenge without any hesitation.

“Lin Yun…” Guardian Plum was concerned because Lin Yun was already injured. How could he take an attack from Bai Lixuan? After all, Bai Lixuan wouldn’t issue the challenge if he wasn’t confident.

“Guardian Plum, there’s no need to persuade me any further. I naturally won’t give up the chance that he’s giving me.” Lin Yun knew what Guardian Plum was concerned about, but this might be his only chance.

“It doesn’t matter if you’re willing to compete for the title, but the Sword Firmament Pavilion can only contain one monstrous genius, which is me. You won’t be able to take Xin Yan away today, nor will you still be living after today because you’re fated to be slain by me!” Bai Lixuan drew his sword, which was a transcendent profound artifact.

A terrifying aura also began to emit from Bai Lixuan as he unleashed his cultivation. His aura was in the pinnacle ninth stage of the Profound Martial Realm. In just the blink of an eye, his aura actually approached quasi-Violet Palace Realm.

“What a powerful aura!” exclaimed someone from among the spectators. The Saint Physique truly couldn’t be underestimated based on how Bai Lixuan was comparable to the quasi-Violet Palace Realm while he was only in the ninth stage. How terrifying would he be the moment he reached the tenth stage?

But that wasn’t all. A sword buzz also rang out from Bai Lixuan’s body along with his quasi-xiantian sword intent radiating out.

“This sword intent!”

“His sword intent isn’t any weaker than Lin Yun’s! Bai Lixuan actually grasped the quasi-xiantian sword intent as well!”

“Lin Yun is finished now.”

“No wonder Bai Lixuan dared to say those words. Lin Yun will probably die for real this time…” Everyone’s face changed when Bai Lixuan unleashed his quasi-xiantian sword intent. But only Qin Yu wore a faint smile on his face because he was confident that he would become the final victor.

“Die!” Bai Lixuan took a step forward and charged at Lin Yun. At that moment, even the descending snowflakes seemed to have frozen in the air.

It only took a split second for Bai Lixuan to appear before Lin Yun. However, Lin Yun hadn't even drawn his sword. Not many people could see Bai Lixuan’s figure, but those who could track Bai Lixuan’s movements couldn’t help but change their facial expressions.

A blinding radiance blossomed from the sword. The light was so bright that everyone had closed their eyes. But when the light slowly faded, an unbelievable scene appeared before their faces.

“This is impossible!” Everyone exclaimed at the scene before them with disbelief. Lin Yun only used two fingers to receive Bai Lixuan’s attack.

Lin Yun was taking a gamble, gambling that his Broken Sword Physique could suppress Bai Lixuan’s Saint Physique.

Lin Yun had already exhausted himself in the previous fight, not to mention that he even took a palm from a Violet Palace Realm expert. He would’ve been dead by now if he didn’t have a strong physique.

However, his origin energy was drained and he was covered with injuries. So there was nothing he could do to receive that attack. But his physique didn’t seem to be working because Bai Lixuan’s sword wasn’t breaking.

“You think you can repeat what you did back then? Fat hope!” Bai Lixuan instantly recalled how he was toyed with by Lin Yun back in the Azure Sun Realm. Back then, Lin Yun had also used the same method to destroy several of his swords.

Bai Lixuan couldn’t help feeling enraged when he saw that Lin Yun was trying to repeat the same tactic. But before he could stab his sword into Lin Yun, his sword suddenly began to tremble violently. Shortly after, cracks began to cover his sword and he also suffered a backlash from his origin energy.

Not giving Bai Lixuan the opportunity to respond, Lin Yun quickly stepped forth and sent a palm onto Bai Lixuan’s chest.

Throwing up a mouthful of blood, Bai Lixuan was sent flying away. This scene had shocked everyone as they watched in disbelief. No one had expected Lin Yun to win.

When Bai Lixuan fell onto the ground, he looked at Lin Yun with rage and reluctance.

“That was for Wuyou. I’ll settle everything else with you during the Dragon Gate Competition,” said Lin Yun as he soared into the sky.

“Get lost!” A bark sounded out just when two members of the Azure Association wanted to stop Lin Yun.

Landing on the carriage, Lin Yun carried Xin Yan without even sparing a glance at Qin Yun. When he turned around, Qin Yu’s eyes blazed with killing intent. However, Qin Yu instantly sensed two sharp gazes falling on him just when he was about to make his move. The two cold gazes came from Guardian Plum and Bloomphoenix Princess, causing Qin Yu to dispel his thoughts of attacking Lin Yun.

In the end, Qin Yu could only watch as Lin Yu left with his bride-to-be. He had never felt so humiliated. He wanted to throw up a mouthful of blood because there was nothing he could do about this situation.

His face suddenly turned red and the origin energy within his body went out of control. In the end, Qin Yu finally couldn’t hold it back in anymore and threw up a mouthful of blood.
