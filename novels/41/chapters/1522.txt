Chapter 1523 - Fighting For The Present And Not Future

Ling Qianye’s corpse dyed the ground with blood on the ninth level of the Blue Dragon Trial Tower. Lin Yun killed him with one palm. Initially, Lin Yun already let him off, fearing that Ling Qianye might risk everything. But it was a pity that Ling Qianye didn’t appreciate his goodwill.

Since Ling Qianye courted death, he might as well fulfill his wish, then. The Blood Devouring Demonic Array collapsed along with Ling Qianye’s death, and turned into countless crimson flowers.

The crimson flowers gathered before Lin Yun while emitting a gentle and charming light before they fused into a fan. It was the inheritance saint artifact of the Blood Moon Sect, the Profound Moon Fan!

Ling Qianye relied on this fan to set up the saint spiritual array, which was the fan's true power. If it was someone else, they would’ve fallen for it. But it was a pity that he ran into Lin Yun, and his fan didn’t bring him fortune and he lost his life since he wasn’t careful.

When Lin Yun grabbed onto the Profound Moon Fan, he toyed with it. When he swung it, his astral energy turned into flames that swept out. “Isn’t it good to be alive? Why did he have to court death…?”

As flames blazed in the hall and incinerated everything, Lin Yun waved his hand again, and the hall was cleaned up. He wanted to refine the Divine Dragon Bone here, but it would’ve been a little disgusting to face the corpses that were on the ground.

But he wasn’t in a hurry to retrieve the Divine Dragon Bone. He sat down with his eyes closed. After placing both of his hands on his lap, he circulated the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon. When he circulated the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon, the dragon-phoenix sword aura within his astral energy filled every single corner of his body.

Wisps of a baleful aura were being refined within his body before they dispersed from his pores. After the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron retrieved his cultivation, it also devoured quite a bit of Ling Qianye’s cultivation, which contained a demonic aura.

The demonic aura was beneficial to demonic cultivators but not to Lin Yun. So Lin Yun naturally had to get rid of it beforehand since it would be troublesome if it became deeply planted within his body.

Half an hour later, Lin Yun opened his eyes, and his black pupils became clearer. After slowly getting up, Lin Yun looked at the Divine Dragon Bone that was hovering in the air, “Time to retrieve the Divine Dragon Bone.”

He felt complicated. He forked out so much for this Divine Dragon Bone and even became Tian Jue’s lackey for some time in the Dragon Remnant Astral Realm. Sensing the cold and mocking gazes, Lin Yun ultimately endured it. His effort didn’t go down the drain because a Divine Dragon Bone was just right before him.

When he got close to the blue stage, Lin Yun was nervous. He then took a deep breath and slowly grabbed the Blue Dragon Bone. The moment he held onto the Blue Dragon Bone, the bone emitted a dazzling blue radiance and a boundless dragon aura.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

It suddenly became ordinary, aside from being heavy. Aside from the ancient divine rune engraved on the Blue Dragon Bone, there was nothing special about it. He had given so much just for this Blue Dragon Bone, and his obsession with it nearly became a demon in his heart. But the Blue Dragon Bone ultimately fell into his hand.

When Lin Yun grabbed a hold of the Blue Dragon Bone, everyone else who was still within the trial tower suddenly felt a rejection power. Soon after, the Heavenly Astral Pavilion’s Tian Jue, Blood Rain Pavilion’s Qin Yue, Seven Absolute Palace’s Pei An, Demonfiend Sect’s Yan Xuan, Hundred Ghost Gate’s Chen Kui, and Netherworld Hall’s Murong Chen were all expelled from the Dragon Astral Realm.

Logically speaking, they should’ve been able to stay within the trial tower for another four to five days before being teleported out of the astral realm. But they were all teleported out of the astral realm to the asteroid belt before then, which instantly caused an uproar amongst the demonic sects.

“They’re out!”

“The chief disciples of the other demonic sects are out! I wonder who obtained the Blue Dragon Bone!”

“You can’t use any tricks in the trial tower. Murong Chen and Ling Qianye have the highest possibility. Wait, why is Ling Qianye nowhere to be seen?” Everyone soon noticed something. There were only six chief disciples, and Ling Qianye was nowhere to be seen.

Everyone was briefly stunned before they turned to look in the direction of the Blood Moon Sect. Everyone was out except for Ling Qianye. So wasn’t it obvious who had the Blue Dragon Bone now?

“The Blue Dragon Bone was obtained by Ling Qianye?” The Samsara Edict Realm elder of the Heavenly Astral Pavilion furrowed his brow and asked Tian Jue.

His words surprised Tian Jue, and he wondered if Ling Qianye obtained the Blue Dragon Bone. This was because Lin Yun was nowhere to be found, and he instantly asked what was happening. If it were before, Tian Jue wouldn’t hesitate to think that Ling Qianye must have killed Lin Yun.

But after fighting Lin Yun, Tian Jue suddenly speculated that Lin Yun wasn’t dead and Ling Qianye was the one who died.

“What’s with your injuries?” The elder of the Heavenly Astral Pavilion asked.

But Tian Jue didn’t answer and said, “Let’s talk about it later. I want to make a breakthrough into the Dragon Pulse Realm, and I need your help to ensure my safety.”

A decisive light flashed across Tian Jue’s pupils. He felt that Lin Yun wasn’t dead, and the Blue Dragon Bone might be in his hands. No matter what, he had to repay Lin Yun for his humiliation in the trial tower.

“Why are you hurrying to reach the Dragon Pulse Realm? There’s no way you can immediately condense dragon origin. What happened in the trial tower?” The Samsara Edict Realm elder asked. This further proved that this matter wasn’t as straightforward as he thought.

Reaching the Dragon Pulse Realm wasn’t an issue, but it wasn’t easy to condense dragon origin at the one-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm.

“I’ve made up my mind!” Tian Jue didn’t want to explain much and immediately closed his eyes. He then took out various saint artifacts and saint elixirs, wanting to make a breakthrough. If he wanted to suppress Lin Yun, his only option was to make a breakthrough to the Dragon Pulse Realm, even if he couldn’t immediately condense dragon origin as the price.

The faces of the other chief disciples were also dark, and they all chose to immediately make a breakthrough. That was the same for Murong Chen. Others might not be able to confirm who had obtained the Blue Dragon Bone, but he knew it was Lin Yun.

Ling Qianye was simply courting death to try and play tricks with that guy. Lin Yun was also the strongest genius he had encountered in his lifetime.

“There’s a high possibility that Ling Qianye is dead. I want to make a breakthrough right away!” Murong Chen said, and his words left the Samsara Edict Realm experts of the Netherworld Hall shocked.

The middle-aged man who was the leader of the Netherworld Hall party furrowed his brows as he looked at Murong Chen. His name was Qiu Qiong, and he was already at the Nirvana Stage of the Samsara Edict Realm. This meant he was only one step away from becoming a saint and was the strongest amongst all the Samsara Edict Realm experts in the asteroid belt.

He was the one who planned for the six demonic sects to join forces against the Heavenly Astral Pavilion, and he was dumbfounded, wondering what happened in the trial tower.

“Elder Qiu, what should we do now?” The other Samsara Edict Realm elders looked at Qiu Cang because they had no idea what to do now.

“It doesn’t matter who obtained the Blue Dragon Bone. He’s just a brat, and there’s no way I can let him escape. Let Murong Chen make a breakthrough. I’ll kill whoever obtains the Blue Dragon Bone, and there’s no need for us to be concerned with the rules about not laying a hand on juniors.” Qiu Cang’s eyes flashed with a ruthless light.

Logically speaking, even demonic cultivators wouldn’t lay their hands on a junior because this was a rapport between sects. But there was always an exception. Qiu Cang spent such a great effort for the Blue Dragon Bone. So there was no way he could see the Blue Dragon Bone being obtained by a junior.

Before great interests, even the so-called “rules” could be broken. In reality, not only he but the Samsara Edict Realm experts of the other demonic sects had similar thoughts. Just the Blue Dragon Bone alone was enough for them to have a fall out, not to mention that there were other treasures.

An Liuyan and Xiao Yun exchanged a glance with shock in their eyes. This was because Lin Yun still hadn’t come out. Xiao Yun wanted to say something, but An Liuyan wore a grave expression as she placed her finger before her lips, her eyes radiating with concern.

Lin Yun grabbed onto the Blue Dragon Bone within the Blue Dragon Trial Tower without knowing that the outside world was utterly chaotic and that a storm was brewing. Looking at the Blue Dragon Bone in his hand, Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts because he knew he had run into deep trouble.

In the past, Lin Yun was only focused on obtaining the Blue Dragon Bone. But now that he had obtained the Blue Dragon Bone, he was thinking about fusing it into his body. The Azure Dragon Bone was once fused into his body with the help of the Azure Dragon Lord.

“Empress, can you help me fuse the Blue Dragon Bone?” Lin Yun asked. He was already used to Lil’ Purple’s existence, and she was unknowingly like an encyclopedia to him.

When Lil’ Purple flew out from the sword box, she donned a white dress while sitting on the Snow Heed Blade. Looking at the Blue Dragon Bone in Lin Yun’s hand, Lil’ Purple couldn’t help having shock in her eyes.

“What’s wrong?” Lin Yun asked.

Lil’ Purple shook her head and replied, “Not many things in the world can trouble me, and I naturally know how to fuse the Blue Dragon Bone. In ancient times, I bestowed phoenix bones to some servants. But…”

“You’re not willing to help me?” Lin Yun asked, surprised.

“Take back those words!” Lil’ Purple turned to coldly look at Lin Yun.

Lin Yun instantly knew that he had spoken the wrong words and immediately apologized.

As Lil’ Purple snorted, she replied, “You lost the Azure Dragon Bone because of me. So I’ll help you to fuse it even if you have no relations with me. I don’t like what you said earlier!”

“Sorry about that!” Lin Yun nodded. He knew he had made a mistake with his words because he was too anxious, and his relationship with Lil’ Purple was no longer ordinary.

Seeing the guilt on Lin Yun’s face, Lil’ Purple smiled, “Alright. I’ll stop teasing you. The Blue Dragon Bone won’t be here for no reason, and everything is related to karma. Although I have no idea what happened after the Golden Era ended, the rise of the nine emperors is definitely related to the inheritance of the Dragon Gate. The Azure Dragon Lord’s inheritance was still fine, but the karma of this Blue Dragon Bone is too heavy. If you accept it, you’ll probably be drawn into the karma of the nine emperors.”

“You serious about that?” Lin Yun asked.

“An Liuyan and Xiao Yun knew more than you. Don’t you know that the Blue Dragon’s lineage always inherits the Dragon Gate Lord’s position? Do you still remember the white-haired bladesman on the wall in the White Dragon Palace?”

“Of course.”

“That person might’ve been the first generation God Ancestor of the Dragon Gate.” Lil’ Purple replied.

“Azure Dragon God Ancestor?”

“That’s right.”

“You’ve seen this person before?”

“I’ve not heard of any legends related to him. Back then, in the ancient battle between the deities, there was a high possibility that we were waiting for him. My memories are incomplete, but I can be sure that the Iris Sword Saint has a huge connection with him. There’s a high possibility that the Iris Sword Saint received his inheritance…”

Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts and asked, “This is related to the Blue Dragon Bone?”

“That’s for sure. I’m worried that the Iris Sword Saint might’ve been the gatekeeper of the Dragon Gate. The sudden appearance of the nine emperors might be related to him. If you refine the Blue Dragon Bone, you will have to inherit that karma.” Lil’ Purple muttered.

“It’s pointless to think about it now. I only fight for the present and not the future. If there’s any karma, I’ll just cut it with a sword.” Lin Yun smiled.

Lin Yun’s face was dark, and his eyes shone with splendor. His words also made Lil’ Purple smile. As her eyes shone brightly, she winked, “If you’re willing, I can help you fuse with the Divine Dragon Bone. But you have to think it through. None of the seven demonic sects are pushovers!”

But Lin Yun’s face was firm, and he said, “I have no fear.”

When he said those words, the Flower Burial Sword vibrated as if it was saying that it was also fearless.
