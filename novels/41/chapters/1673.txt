Chapter 1674 – Nirvana Banquet

Lin Yun engraved the rhythm of this song in his heart. Through the thick fog, he could see a little girl singing at the top of the snowy mountain. He realized he was a little hurried in leaving and didn’t wait for Lil’ Red.

But he had no choice because he had a reason to leave. He was bidding farewell to Lil’ Purple and the Ancient Barren Domain. He left today to ensure that he would become stronger in the future and reach the peak of the Ancient Barren Domain.

I will be back. Lin Yun inwardly said before he turned around. When he turned around, he executed the Divine Tortoise Transformation, and his appearance changed. Since he had to use his dragon origin to circulate the Divine Tortoise Transformation, a stinging pain came from his dragon pulses.

Bearing the pain, his appearance had undergone a drastic transformation when he turned around. Putting on the Silver Moon Mask, the mask only covered half his face, revealing his chin and lips. He muttered, “From today onwards, my name will be Lin Xiao.”

He had gained complete control of the Silver Moon Mask. When he didn’t activate it, it was only an ordinary silvery mask that could conceal his identity and aura. Activating it could turn his hair silver, and his mental energy would increase by onefold and could even block an attack directed at his heart.

Farewell… Lin Yun muttered, looking at the river beneath him and following the current. The far end of the river was the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea, so he would reach the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea if he followed the river.

This river was dangerous because it had many demonic beasts, including those at the Nirvana Stage or Saint Realm. This river had many legends, and ruins were often found at the bottom of the riverbed, along with the tombs of ancient ominous beasts.

With the obstruction of the river, it took a lot of work for ordinary cultivators at the Dragon Pulse Realm to travel alone, not to mention ordinary people. This natural barrier blocked the expansion of the Ancient Barren Domain.

The Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea was massive, and an inner sea existed in ancient times. It was a place without jurisdiction, not the holy lands, demonic sects, or the Ancient Barren Domain. Many ruthless people gathered there, most of whom were hunted by righteous and demonic forces. Many experts of the righteous and demonic paths were also gathered here when they had no where to go, and it could only be described with ‘Unholy.’

There were many ancient legends buried under the seabed. The west was the Eastern Desolation’s Demon Domain, the East was the Blood Moon Sect, the north was where the holy lands were located, and the south was the Ancient Barren Domain. Because of its unique location, it wasn’t wrong to call it the center of the Ancient Desolation Domain.

Lin Yun occasionally ran into powerful demonic beasts along the river. He used his music dao combined with sword intent to kill several demonic beasts at the Dragon Pulse Realm. As for those beneath the Dragon Pulse Realm, he had slain countless of them.

He even ran into an overlord demonic beast at the seventh-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, and the fighting prowess of this demonic beast was comparable to Qin Tian. Not to mention that it had an advantage in its field. In the end, Lin Yun could only execute the Golden Crow Wings to flee from this demonic beast.

Half a month later, Lin Yun officially stepped into the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea through the river. Throughout this period, Lin Yun would play the flute as he traveled, regardless of day or night. He would cultivate the Phoenix Heart Song during the day, which was used by the Divine Phoenix Clan to temper their mental energy. Thus, Lin Yun’s mental energy had grown by a vast extent, reaching the height of a third-grade spiritualist. Logically speaking, he could suppress those with three or four dragon pulses.

But that was under the prerequisite that he grasped sufficient saint runes, divine abilities, and saint diagrams. It was a pity that Lin Yun had none of them.

At night, a massive boat appeared from the rear when Lin Yun played the flute as he traveled. Most people would travel by boat on this river because it was safer, and they could save time in cultivating. Only a few would travel by themselves, like Lin Yun.

But this boat wasn’t ordinary, since it wasn’t a cruise boat. This boat was gorgeous, engraved with many complicated flower runes. Not only did they serve as decorations, they were also spiritual runes. This boat held many flags, and music could be heard from the boat, along with feminine chuckles.

“The Heavenly Note Sect?” Lin Yun could determine from the flag that this boat belonged to the Heavenly Note Sect.

The Heavenly Note Sect was an ally of the Sword Sect, and Lin Yun had a decent relationship with Luo Shuyi. If it were in the past, he would definitely get on the boat and greet them. But now, he merely glanced at them before he continued his journey.

In the highest cabin of the ship, the decorations were elegant and fragrant in the room. The chief disciple of the Heavenly Note Sect, Lin Wan, was with Luo Shuyi. She wore a light purple dress while sitting on a wooden chair.

She looked at Luo Shuyi, “Shuyi, this isn’t a solution. We’ll be returning soon, and the competition will be intense. How do you plan to face it in your current state?”

But Luo Shuyi wasn’t paying attention to her, and her pupils were dazing off. She asked, “Senior Sister, why isn't there any news? Our Heavenly Note Sect sent out two Saint elders, but there isn't any news of Young Master Lin. I wonder how he is now…”

“Don’t tell me that you’ve fallen for him?” Lin Wan teased.

Shaking her head, Luo Shuyi replied, “Senior Sister, what are you talking about? I promised Big Sister Yue to look after him, but he has disappeared. How am I going to explain this to Big Sister Yue?”

“What are you thinking about? Perhaps he might have needed your help when he just arrived in the Kunlun Realm, but how are you going to look after him now? He’s the champion of the Ninth Heavenly Path, the strongest genius in the history of the Heavenly Paths. He will grow into a colossal figure, sooner or later. In less than three years, he could even slay a Saint Lord now, and not even the Radiant Sword Saint could protect him. So what are you worried about?”

“I’m not worried about him, but I don’t know what to tell Big Sister Yue.” Luo Shuyi said, vexed.

“Just treat it like he has died and let her give up on him.” Lin Wan said after a brief pondering.

“But…” Luo Shuyi was stunned when she heard that.

“I know what you’re trying to say. But how could he still be alive even if he managed to leave the Ancient Barren Domain? The Firmament Saint Cloth tempted even the Nine Emperors. Although Yu Qingfeng protected him once, he didn’t say he would protect Lin Yun for the rest of his life.”

Luo Shuyi bit her lips and was hesitant. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Seeing this, Lin Wan gently sighed, “Even if he’s alive, he definitely won’t dare to show himself. If he’s smart, he’ll go into hiding for one or two hundred years, ensuring that no one can find him. But it’ll be hard for him to go into hiding. So just treat it as if he has died.”

A maid suddenly barged into the room. That maid smiled, “Senior Sister, a weirdo is playing the flute on the river. But the flute he played was beautiful, and we all listened to it. We wanted to invite him to get on the boat. Senior Sister, do you want to go and take a look?”

Luo Shuyi and Lin Wan exchanged a glance, and this was because the women in the Heavenly Note Sect were familiar with music dao. If this person the maid spoke of didn’t have any attainment in music, they definitely wouldn’t be alarmed.

Lin Wan turned to look at Luo Shuyi and smiled, “This is weird. Shuyi, let’s go and take a look.”

Just like that, Luo Shuyi was dragged out of the room, and they came to the deck. There was a group of ladies chuckling as they looked at the river. They could see a white person with long hair draped to his shoulders. He wore a mask, and he was playing the flute.

“What exquisite music.” Lin Wan said, looking at Luo Shuyi. “Shuyi, do you know the name of this song?”

“I don’t know, but it seems to be ancient music, since it contains many ancient rhythms.” Initially, Luo Shuyi wasn’t bothered, but she grew increasingly surprised as she listened to the music. This music wasn’t only delightful to the ears, but it was so comfortable that it felt like she was basking in the moonlight.

But the more she looked at this person, the more surprised she became. For some reason, this person gave her a familiar feeling.

Lin Wan didn’t interrupt Lin Yun and waited for him to finish playing the song before she smiled, “Friend, I’m Lin Wan of the Heavenly Note Sect. Your music contains ancient rhythm in it. I wonder if you’re willing to board our ship and exchange our insights on music?”

She was curious and wanted to know this person’s identity because she also practiced the music dao. So she felt Lin Yun definitely heard of the Heavenly Note Sect, and he wouldn’t refuse her offer.

Lowering the flute, Lin Yun said, “My surname is Lin, and I’m used to being alone. I’m afraid that I’ll have to reject your offer.”

The doubt in Luo Shuyi became denser because the figure of this person was similar to Lin Yun, not to mention that Lin Yun was also proficient in music dao. This made her wonder if this person could be Lin Yun, and her emotions became agitated. She wanted to take a closer look at him, but she couldn’t because it was nighttime, and the river was surging with waves.

“Big Sister Lin, get him to come up.” Luo Shuyi quickly said.

After being rejected, Lin Wan initially wanted to politely end the conversation. But when she heard what Luo Shuyi said, she smiled, “Young Master Lin, there’s no need for you to be so courteous. My sisters on the boat are curious about you, and we have a similar hobby. I believe we will gain something from each other by exchanging our insights. After all, it is fate that we ran into each other.”

She was the chief disciple of the Heavenly Note Sect, and she had already given Lin Yun a lot of face by lowering herself.

“I’m just a guest crossing the river. Why do we need to get acquainted when we run into each other? We’ll meet again if we’re fated.” Lin Yun smiled. When he was done, he waved his hand and swiftly traveled along the river.

Luo Shuyi’s gaze was still glued on him. He would be in grave danger should his identity be revealed. Not only would he be hunted, but he would also bring trouble to those around him. So how would he board the Heavenly Note Sect’s ship?

“Haha. That person is interesting, to run so quickly. Is he afraid that we’ll gobble him up?”

“Is he despising our beauty to reject Senior Sister’s offer?”

“But the song he played is lovely. He must have a prestigious background!” The women on the ship smiled as they watched Lin Yun disappear into the distance.

“Big Sister Lin, chase after him quickly! He’s Lin Yun!” Luo Shuyi said emotionally, with her eyes shining brightly.

But Lin Wan’s face sank, and she reprimanded, “What are you thinking about? You must have gone insane.”

“Big Sister Lin, he’s really Lin Yun! Lin Yun is also proficient in music, or he wouldn’t have fled so quickly!” Luo Shuyi grew increasingly anxious and even wanted to chase after Lin Yun by herself.

Lin Wan quickly tugged her down, and she coldly said, “Wake up! The song he played is ancient, and his music attainment probably isn’t inferior to us. There’s also a high possibility that he grasped the Saint Tone. Can you tell? Lin Yun is a swordsman, so where did he get so much time to research the music dao?”

Luo Shuyi was briefly stunned, and she soon calmed down.

“Furthermore, do you think he’d dare to publicly show himself if he’s really Lin Yun? Has your intelligence dropped, or do you think Lin Yun is a fool to appear publicly?” Lin Wan retorted.

“I’m sorry.” Luo Shuyi sighed. She knew she was impulsive earlier, and she should’ve recognized a huge difference in music dao between this person and Lin Yun.

“But if you want to meet him again, there might still be a chance. He should be a disciple of an Ancient Saint Clan in the Divine Dragon Empire and heading towards the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea. He’s definitely here for the Nirvana Banquet, and you’ll be able to see him, then.” Lin Wan said with her facial expression easing.

Luo Shuyi pondered what Lin Wan said and realized it did make sense. The Three-Lives Tree was going to bloom, and the Nirvana Banquet was an event held every decade, attracting all of the Kunlun Realm’s musicians.

But she was calm because she no longer had any interest in meeting that youth again after realizing there was a low possibility of him being Lin Yun.
