Chapter 1632 - I'm Not Picking On Anyone

As the location of the Blue Dragon Saint Palace was gradually being confirmed, an undercurrent began to take place in the Ancient Barren Battlefield. Many people took this opportunity to make a breakthrough before the saint palace appeared, and their breakthroughs naturally caused a shocking phenomenon. Many people were already attempting to reach the fourth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, and it wasn’t an issue for them, with saint elixirs strengthening their foundations.

But the Dragon Pulse Realm differed from the other realms; each breakthrough was a life-death experience. It didn’t mean that one with a stronger foundation could make a breakthrough. Out of ten people who tried to make a breakthrough, at least half would lose their lives.

But even so, the odds were unbelievable in the eyes of others. One must know that everyone who had entered the Ancient Barren Battlefield have been there for two months, and most of them were only at the second-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm when they came in.

Who could’ve thought that in just two months, everyone would be able to grow to such an extent? This was the charm of the Ancient Barren Battlefield, which was why every sect wanted to send their disciples in, despite the danger. It was so much so that even the holy lands and demonic sects sent their disciples in.

Seven days later, after knowing the Blue Dragon Saint Palace’s location, everyone gathered in the barren land. Nearly ten thousand people had gathered here.

One must know that over a hundred thousand people have entered this Ancient Barren Battlefield, but there were less than ten thousand people who were there. There were many reasons, but more than half of the people died from the danger here. Most importantly, the Blue Dragon Saint Palace would naturally be accompanied by great danger, and some people were already satisfied with their harvests. So they didn’t want to take any further risks. There was also the last reason: not everyone knew about the Blue Dragon Saint Palace’s region. Most chief disciples of the smaller forces weren’t qualified to know at all.

Thus, everyone who had gathered there were practically the elites amongst the geniuses who entered the Ancient Barren Battlefield.

“This is the Blue Dragon Saint Palace? Why aren’t there any phenomena? We’re not in the wrong place, right…?”

“Yeah. Not to mention the blue dragon, there’s nothing here, not even dragon aura.”

“Let’s go and take a look!” Many people were baffled when they came to this barren land. But when they flew up and tried to enter the region covered in sandstorms, they were instantly repelled by an invisible forcefield. There was a barrier here that forbade anyone from approaching.

Many people didn’t believe it, but they failed in the end. Some even tried to forcibly enter by summoning their constellations and saint artifacts, but they were crushed to death by that immense pressure, dying terrible deaths.

This was terrifying, dispelling many people’s thoughts about entering the sandstorm. When the Sword Sect’s party arrived, Lin Yun activated his Divine Dragon Eyes while looking at that region. His gaze quickly passed through the sandstorm and saw an empty patch of land.

While he was baffled, a pair of eyes suddenly appeared. This struck Lin Yun with a heavy blow, and he quickly retracted his gaze. There was a divine blue dragon coiling around a giant pagoda. So this meant that they just had to wait where they were.

The Blue Dragon Saint Palace is really there! Lin Yun inwardly exclaimed. But why wasn’t it the Azure Dragon Saint Palace? The Azure Dragon Saint Lord was clearly strong, but he had no position amongst the seven colored divine dragons. Could it be that it had a saint palace elsewhere?

Lin Yun obtained the Azure Dragon Saint Physique. Although he had refined a Blue Dragon Bone, he was naturally looking forward to the Azure Dragon inheritance more. Besides, regardless of his Azure Dragon Saint Physique or the Azure Dragon Saint Art, there was still room for improvement.

He was shocked by the Azure Dragon Saint Lord’s strength back then. Although the Azure Dragon wasn’t a divine dragon, it was one of the four natural constellations. This meant that the Azure Dragon’s potential wasn’t at all inferior to the Blue Dragon's, it might be even stronger.

“What are you thinking about?” Ye Ziling turned to look at Lin Yun.

Lin Yun shares his thoughts with her with a smile, since there was nothing to keep from Ye Ziling.

Ye Ziling briefly pondered before she replied, “I heard that the four natural constellations of the previous era were the Blue Dragon, Vermillion Bird, Black Tortoise, and White Tiger. But in the Divine Dragon Era, the Blue Dragon was changed to Azure Dragon. The Azure Dragon is an extremely mysterious existence, and the Azure Dragon Saint Lord was a powerful existence in ancient times. It was one of the leaders in the Kunlun Realm.”

“Oh?” Lin Yun’s eyes lit up upon hearing that.

“What Junior Sister Ye said is right. The Azure Dragon is extremely mysterious, and they have a close relationship with the Blue Dragon. The Azure Dragon Lord used to be one of the leaders in the Dragon Gate. So there might be an inheritance related to the Azure Dragon in the Blue Dragon Saint Palace.” Gu Ruochen said. He could tell that Lin Yun possessed the Azure Dragon Saint Physique and cultivated the Azure Dragon’s body-refining technique. So he hoped that Lin Yun could go further in the Azure Dragon’s path.

“Are you serious?” Lin Yun asked.

“This…” Gu Ruochen hesitated because he wasn’t too sure about it. He wasn’t lying when he said the Azure Dragon had a close relationship with the Blue Dragon. But he wasn’t sure if the Azure Dragon’s inheritance could be found in the Blue Dragon Saint Palace.

Lin Yun smiled and no longer asked about it, but at least this meant that he had some hope. As time passed, more people gathered, and the eight powerful sects arrived one after another. Aside from that, there were several powerful auras mixed within the crowd.

“Those people are from the holy lands, right?” Lin Yun asked Gu Ruochen. They were careful not to reveal any aura, but their attempt to disguise themselves was nothing in the eyes of experts like Lin Yun and Gu Ruochen.

“That’s right.” Gu Ruochen nodded. Since he often traveled the Eastern Desolation, he had some interaction with people from the holy lands. “That person in the northwest is an inner disciple of the holy land Heavenly Flame Sect, Wang Tao. For him to become an inner disciple in a holy land means that he could compete with the powerful sects’ chief disciples like us.”

Lin Yun followed the direction he pointed at and saw an unremarkable blue-robed youth not too far away. That person had retracted his aura and was calmly looking at the sandstorm region. But if one looked at him closely, one would notice that this was a prideful person, and no one dared to get close to him.

“The grey-robed youth over there should be the inner disciple of the holy land Sacred Westfloral Sect, Chen Yu. Those two over there should also be from some holy lands, but I don’t know their names.” Gu Ruochen said.

An hour later, the eight powerful sects’ disciples gathered here, aside from the Profound Sky Sect, Vajra Monastery, and the Emerald Jade Manor.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“The Vajra Monastery and the Emerald Jade Manor aren’t here yet. Can it be that the rumors are true?”

“What rumors?”

“Don’t ask me about it. The culprit is here. I heard that the Vajra Monastery’s Xuan Feng and Emerald Jade Manor’s Chen Tao died in Lin Yun's hands.”

“Oh my god. Are you serious? Isn’t Lin Yun a little too ruthless? Not only did he kill Yan Kong, but the chief disciples of the Vajra Monastery and Emerald Jade Manor as well?”

“Who knows? I heard that it was over a Sovereign Saint Artifact. Lin Yun fought three alone and nearly killed the Heavenly Blade Pavilion’s Xiao Kui. He does have the Radiant Sword Saint’s silhouette in him, and the Sword Sect will probably rise this time.” Discussions resounded from the surroundings as everyone’s attention became focused on the Sword Sect’s party.

Few knew about Lin Yun’s battle with Xiao Kui, Chen Tao, and Xuan Feng. But everyone who could come here had practically witnessed Lin Yun’s battle with Yan Kong. So it was almost impossible for them to forget about it, and just thinking about that battle alone was enough to make their blood boil.

Lin Yun swept through the eight powerful sects alone and only used one sword to slay Yan Kong. Compared to Lin Yun, the other sects’ chief disciples were pale.

“The Profound Sky Sect is here!” Right then, a chill suddenly swept over as the Profound Sky Sect’s party descended from the sky. The party leader was Qin Tian, and he hovered in the air like a deity that instantly made everyone feel suffocating.

Zhang Yuan and Liu Xu, who were beside him, were also striking. They didn’t even bother concealing their auras. But they were still slightly inferior to Qin Tian because the aura given off by Qin Tian was too terrifying.

Before everyone could come to their senses, a terrifying killing intent exploded that made everyone’s faces change. They began to wonder if the Profound Sky Sect’s party was about to start a massacre when they had just arrived. Was the Profound Sky Sect going to fight with the Sword Sect before the Blue Dragon Saint Palace opened up?

As everyone’s anticipation grew, they also felt nervous at the same time. If the Profound Sky Sect and Sword Sect were to fight here, the benefits in the saint palace would naturally go to them. But who could have guessed that Qin Tian would merely swept his gaze over everyone before he said, “Get lost if you guys don’t want to die. The Blue Dragon Saint Palace belongs to my Profound Sky Sect. Death to anyone who dares to intrude. Half an incense’s time later, don’t blame me for being merciless if anyone is still here.”

His words instantly left everyone dumbfounded because Qin Tian wasn’t picking on the Sword Sect but everyone present.

“What gives! The Blue Dragon Saint Palace is the inheritance of the Dragon Gate, and it has nothing to do with your Profound Sky Sect. You guys are taking it too—” Someone was naturally unhappy and spoke out, which instantly drew resonation with everyone in the surroundings.

In the next moment, that person's head was blown apart, leaving everyone shocked as they looked at Qin Tian in fear. They had no idea what happened earlier. They only knew that this person’s head was blown apart when Qin Tian glanced at him from ten-odd miles away.

Just how powerful was Qin Tian? Even the faces of the powerful sects’ chief disciples changed. When Xiao Kui and others looked at Qin Tian, they could feel a chill run down their spines because they knew that Qin Tian was serious. The Profound Sky Sect planned on monopolizing the entire Blue Dragon Saint Palace.
