Chapter 1099 - Unrivalled Young Master

The crowd looked at Lin Yun with renewed impressions. It didn’t matter if it was the Kunlun Realm, Profound Amber Realm, or the brutal Heavenly Path, experts were respected. Naturally, Lin Yun’s strength had won their approval. Even though there were a lot of people unhappy with Lin Yun, his courage to accept Feng Zhang’s challenge had won their approval. On the other hand, they all felt that Feng Zhang was a little too shameless.

Not only was he going to challenge Lin Yun as an empyrean, but he even planned to take Lin Yun’s quota. If the sect master hadn’t said anything, he would have been fine with acting shamelessly.

“Junior Brother Lin, we’re in agreement then. I’ll suppress my cultivation to the Heavenly Soul Realm, and I’ll consider you the winner if you can last ten moves. Then again, I'll also consider my loss if you can force me to use my Empyrean Realm cultivation. But if you lose, you’ll accept the outcome, right?” Feng Zhang smiled.

“Of course,” replied Lin Yun.

A cold light flashed through Feng Zhang’s eyes, “To keep things fair, I also won’t use my holy spirit martial technique.”

“You can go ahead and use it. It doesn’t really matter to me,” smiled Lin Yun.

Hearing that, Feng Zhang began to sneer inwardly. He couldn’t wait to see the expression Lin Yun would make after losing. With a smile, Feng Zhang looked at the sect master, “Sect Master, please announce the battle.”

Now that the bet was established, no one would say a word about the outcome. Many inner disciples were unhappy when they saw this scene, but the core disciples weren’t too affected by it. At the very least, the quota to ascend the Sword Saint Mountain wouldn’t fall into the hands of an outsider. If Lin Yun obtained the qualification to ascend the Sword Saint Mountain, they would naturally feel terrible.

“This is the last fight,” said the sect master as he emitted a terrifying aura. His words let everyone know that the quota to ascend the Sword Saint Mountain was about to be decided. In jealousy, all of the core disciples stared at Feng Zhang.

“Can Junior Brother Yun make it through this?” Wang Yuruo whispered.

“Impossible,” replied Ye Ziling. Her temperament was similar to the sect master, but she had traces of pride and stubbornness in her pupils. In reality, she was also qualified to be prideful because she was one of the two who had grasped sky sword intent.

“Junior Brother Lin, sorry about that.” Feng Zhang smiled as he emitted a terrifying aura. In the blink of an eye, his aura dropped to the pinnacle of the seventh soul Heavenly Soul Realm. Compared to Wu Kun, his aura was a lot stronger because of his foundation as an empyrean.

Sensing the aura, many inner disciples were shocked. Then, they were surprised again by the Demonic Astral Flowers that flew out of Feng Zhang’s body.

Feng Zhang’s changes summoned a violent gale that caused lightning to streak across the horizon. His aura was still basically at the empyrean level. All the core disciples sneered at Lin Yun when they saw this. After all, Feng Zhang represented core disciples like them, and it would be weird if he couldn’t deal with someone like Lin Yun.

“Haha, sorry about that, brat. I’m not talented and only managed to plant ten Demonic Astral Flowers in my aura oceans when I was in the Heavenly Soul Realm. This isn’t fair for you, but nothing is fair in the world!” Feng Zhang wore a smug face and even addressed Lin Yun as a brat.

Feng Zhang not only wanted to win, but he wanted to completely crush Lin Yun. Lin Yun dares to say that no one worthy is in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect? Then who am I?!

Fegn Zhang waved his hand and summoned a sword into his hand. He brought out his dao artifact that further increased his aura.

“First, Firmament Shaking Wind!” With a sword flash, a violent gale tore apart the clouds with countless bolts of lightning flashing everywhere. Many disciples instantly recognized it as the Wind Manipulation Sword Technique that only core disciples were qualified to practice.

Clearly, Feng Zhang had reached greater mastery in it. Lin Yun was surprised because it looked like he had underestimated the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s foundation. He could tell that the sword technique was strong, but that was all there was to it.

He was confident that none of the core disciples could defeat him in the Heavenly Soul Realm. If Ye Ziling had a tiny chance of beating Lin Yun, there was no hope for Feng Zhang. Just when Lin Yun was about to be devoured by the violent gale, he threw out a casual punch. Instantly, Feng Zhang’s attack was shattered.

No one expected Lin Yun to deal with Feng Zhang’s attack so easily. On the other hand, the elders on the stage lit up with excitement, “What powerful attainment in the sword!”

They could naturally tell that Lin Yun had relied on his powerful attainment in the sword to find the flaw in Feng Zhang’s attack. It might seem simple, but it required high attainment in the sword, deep comprehension, and very keen eyes. If Lin Yun had made a single mistake, he would have been killed. Clearly, his confidence surprised the elders.

“Doesn’t seem impressive after all.” Lin Yun raised his brow and gave Feng Zhang a smile.

Hearing Lin Yun’s response, Feng Zhang snorted coldly, “Let me see how long you can last for!” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Wind Manipulating Lightning!” Swinging his sword out again, Feng Zhang's attack roared like a ferocious beast while the lightning made his face look sinister. When his sword descended, the lightning rumble made everyone’s soul tremble.

Lin Yun merely smiled in response before he executed the Golden Crow Nine Transformations. Leaving afterimages in his tracks, he reached out with his hand, unleashed a dragon roar, and casually swiped his fingers across the air. Afterwards, the phenomenon manifested by Feng Zhang’s sword technique instantly crumbled.

“Wave Riding Wind!” Feng Zhang’s face grew darker as he stabbed his sword out. With every second that his sword pierced through space, a storm grew stronger around his sword.

When his attack arrived in front of Lin Yun, his sword ruthlessly targeted Lin Yun’s forehead. The crowd roared in anticipation. Simultaneously, Wang Yuruo covered her mouth while her face turned pale. Ye Ziling also locked her brows together because she felt that Feng Zhang was trying a little too hard to take Lin Yun’s life.

As for the other core disciples, they didn’t say a word. They believed that Lin Yun’s arrogance deserved death by Feng Zhang’s sword.

For Feng Zhang, he felt humiliated that Lin Yun easily resolved his attacks twice in a row. So since Lin Yun was courting death, he would respond in kind.

“Good!” But contrary to his expectation, Lin Yun had no trace of fear on his face. Lin Yun merely raised his brow before he smiled and joined his hands together. Then, his boundless sword intent soared towards the sky.

Something bizarre took place as Feng Zhang’s sword suddenly slowed down in front of Lin Yun. It was like Feng Zhang was moving in slow motion as Lin Yun tilted his body to avoid the attack. Then, Lin Yun smiled and flicked his finger, causing Feng Zhang’s sword to bend. As soon as this happened, his palms started to bleed.

Feng Zhang was shocked because he never expected the attack he was so confident in to be resolved so easily. Even the core disciples and elders began to exclaim.

Lin Yun was resolving Feng Zhang’s attacks masterfully. Lin Yun found the flaws in Feng Zhang’s attacks the first two times, but this time his sword completely surpassed Feng Zhang’s sword. Feng Zhang wants to create an insurmountable wave? I’ll just make an even higher one.

Everyone could tell that Lin Yun wasn’t proficient in the realm of water and that his method was a little crude. Then again, he had forcibly created a gigantic wave with his sword intent that was larger than Feng Zhang’s wave. So the core disciples were impressed. However, the outer and inner disciples couldn’t tell how profound Lin Yun’s flick was, so they weren’t as impressed.

Resolving three of Zhang’s attacks was the same as slapping him three times on the face. So Feng Zhang’s face flushed from anger and his attacks became even more ferocious. Now, his Wind Manipulating Sword Technique was exhibiting more power.

However, Lin Yun continued to casually fend off Feng Zhang’s attacks in an elegant manner. No matter how ferocious Feng Zhang got, he was unsuccessful. Feng Zhang’s face became twisted as he threw up blood from his failed attacks.

At this moment, the core disciples took pity on Feng Zhang. They felt bad that Lin Yun was ruthlessly embarrassing Feng Zhang in front of all the disciples.

Finally, Lin Yun easily resolved Feng Zhang’s last attack. With that, he landed on the ground while drawing everyone’s attention.

“Senior Brother Feng, that was ten moves,” smiled Lin Yun.

“So what?” Feng Zhang’s face changed, but he didn’t want to admit defeat.

“Nothing much. I have a flick that I’d like you to experience. Tell me what you think about it,” smiled Lin Yun. When he was done, the 24 Demonic Astral Flowers in his body began to light up as he reached out with his right hand. At the same time, the Iris Flower in his violet palace began to revolve with light before boundless sword intent poured into his arm and fingers. Then, he touched his middle finger to his thumb.

At the same time, a colossal Iris Flower bloomed behind Lin Yun with flowers that fell to the ground to create a sea of flames.

With the three layers of flowers and 24 Demonic Astral Flowers, no one questioned Lin Yun’s capability as a peerless talent.
