Chapter 2258 - I Have Always Kept A Low Profile

Lin Yun finally eased the awkward atmosphere with the help of Su Ziyao.

“Don’t talk about that anymore,” Su Ziyao smiled as she patted Lil’ Purple’s head.

“Alright, don’t waste time talking and leave,” Lil’ Purple said with disdain. She continued, “The Sun Divine Rune and Divine Mulberry Tree can last for roughly an hour, so you must leave quickly.”

Nodding in acknowledgment, Lin Yun turned to Su Ziyao, and said, “Ziyao, I will take my leave first. I will wait for you.”

“Yeah. Wait for me,” Su Ziyao said with a gentle smile. When they looked at each other, they couldn’t help kissing each other, making Lil’ Purple bashful and furious while looking at them.

After Lin Yun soared to the sky and avoided several attacks from the hand, the two women heaved sighs in relief, and watched as Lin Yun reached the waterfall's top. This meant that the divine rune drawn by Lil’ Purple was effective, and it shouldn’t be an issue for him to leave the Fallen God Valley.

“You didn’t tell him how dangerous it would be to subdue the bone hand, right?” Lil’ Purple suddenly asked.

Su Ziyao looked at the black vortex with the smile on her face gone, replaced with aloofness. She shook her head and replied, “There’s no need for that.”

“Even if you manage to subdue it, you will have to pay a high price for using it. It’s not worth it when compared to the risks,” Lil’ Purple muttered.

Shaking her head, Su Ziyao said, “I have to try it. When the Radiant Sword Saint undergoes his tribulation, Lin Yun will probably be there, based on his character. I was not not around at the Ancient Barren Battlefield, nor was I at the Heavenly Dao Sect on the ninth… So I must be by his side this time.”

She had made up her mind with a firm gaze without hesitation, even if she had to stand on the opposite side of the Divine Dragon Empire and go against the Empress’ intentions. This was because she was Lin Yun’s wife and she would walk down with Lin Yun no matter what may happen.

“The Sun Divine Rune is bizarre,” Lin Yun muttered. He didn’t even have to use his sword intent and reached the top of the waterfall in just a few flashes. As long as he could withstand the pressure, the attacks from the hand wouldn’t be that tough to deal with.

“I wonder when we can meet again…” Lin Yun turned around, looking down at the waterfall with melancholy before smiling. Since coming to the Kunlun Realm, his time in the Fallen God Valley was the best.

“I’m now no longer a boy …” Lin Yun smiled. After all, he had a wife now. When he reached the valley, he was filled with emotions while looking at the skeletons.

He would have had trouble leaving the Fallen God Valley if he didn’t hear the zither music coming from the bottom of the waterfall. Perhaps it was fate that brought him and Su Ziyao together.

“Time to leave!” Lin Yun raised his head and tapped his foot on the ground, soaring up the valley like a lightning bolt with the Sun Divine Rune shining brightly. As the Sun Divine Rune began to burn, so did the branches of the Divine Mulberry Tree. It didn’t take long before Lin Yun looked like a rising sun charging from the bottom of the Fallen God Valley.

An hour later, the light shining from Lin Yun became dim, and the power of the Sun Divine Rune and Divine Mulberry Tree became fully exhausted. It turned out that Lil’ Purple was wrong. It couldn't last for an hour.

But he could already see the top of the valley, so it shouldn’t be a problem for him to reach it. His hair began to flutter violently as the wind made his face feel a stinging pain.

A few minutes later, he was only about two thousand meters from the top. Right then, he heard something falling, soon brushing past him.

“That’s…Li Feibai?” Lin Yun was inwardly shocked just when he was about to reach the valley's top. His body sank, then he reached out with his right hand. Nine chains then flew out from his palm.

When the lightning flashed, Li Feibai raised her head to see Lin Yun, and she was shocked. She exclaimed, “Lin Yun!”

“Come up.” There was no time to explain before the nine chains wrapped around Li Feibai and pulled her over to his side. A dragon’s roar echoed as Lin Yun activated the Azure Dragon Divine Physique, with his blood boiling like magma and lightning flickering on the surface of his body.

With a dragon’s aura spreading out, an Azure Dragon coiled around them as Lin Yun withstood the pressure head-on with his physique and reached the cliffside.

“Why did you go down?”

“How did you come up?”

When they regained their footing, they spoke out at the same time.

“You first.”

“You first.”

They spoke out at the same time again, before they burst into laughter.

“You go first. I’ll listen,” Lin Yun said, looking at Li Feibai. The other party was still in her disguise as a man.

Looking at Lin Yun with a complicated gaze, Li Feibai said, “The news of you falling down the Fallen God Valley has long spread throughout the Blood Flame Plains. I've waited for you for seven days before deciding to look at the bottom of the valley, but I didn’t expect you to come up. I jumped off with the intention that I might die, but you came up.”

Lin Yun smiled, saying, “You’re a real friend.”

“That’s for sure,” Li Feibai happily replied. She asked, “How did you manage to come up?”

Lin Yun concealed some important details and replied, “I made a breakthrough in my Azure Dragon Divine Physique, so I came up.”

“Looks like the Azure Dragon Divine Physique is as powerful as rumored,” Li Feibai said with admiration.

Lin Yun awkwardly smiled, twitching the corner of his lips, but he concealed it well, so Li Feibai didn’t notice it. It looked like he couldn’t get through that joke anymore.

“Mhm? I didn’t see you wear this before. Now that I look at it, you’re pretty dashing while wearing it,” Li Feibai said as she examined Lin Yun.

Lin Yun looked dashing in his new clothes that perfectly made his temperament stand out, like a Sword Immortal.

“This is the Azure Saint Cloth. My wife sewed it personally. It looks great, right?” Lin Yun smiled.

“It’s not bad…” Li Feibai replied with a smile. But she soon felt something wasn’t right, so she exclaimed, “You’re married? When?!”

“That’s a secret,” Lin Yun smiled.

“You’re really married?” Li Feibai asked, still unwilling to give up.

“Yeah,” Lin Yun replied.

Li Feibai was speechless as that news caught her by surprise. After a while, she recollected herself and smiled, “Sorry for losing my composure. I was just a little surprised that you would get married at such a young age. It’s shocking even in the Kunlun Realm, and you’re…”

What she said wasn’t wrong because geniuses had a long lifespan. So, for someone like Lin Yun to get married at the age of twenty-six was shocking.

Lin Yun smiled, “I understand, not to mention that I’m known as a Holy Maiden Killer, right?”VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Li Feibai awkwardly said, “It looks like I’ve misunderstood you.”

“Let’s not dwell on that any longer and leave this place. Don’t even think about jumping down because you will die, even with a Sovereign Constellation.”

While the two quickly left this place, Lin Yun inquired about what was happening in the Blood Flame Plains. He found out that after he jumped off the Fallen God Valley, it soon caused an uproar on the Blood Flame Plains, but it quickly passed because there were more things going on in the Blood Flame Plains. There were many treasures and forbidden grounds.

Many Saints were losing their lives here, so the death of a genius was nothing much. It was just that this genius happened to be called Flower Burial. But most people felt that the loss of the Divine Blood Fruit was more of a pity. Since they couldn’t obtain the Divine Blood Fruit, they naturally moved on to searching for other treasures.

The Blood Flame Plains was filled with opportunities, with various saint elixirs being found by others. Relying on those treasures, many people have managed to greatly boost their strength.

The three holy lands of the Eastern Desolation, the Ming Cult, the Heavenly Flame Sect, and the Myriad Lightning Sect took the limelight. The three holy lands joined forces to eradicate the Blood Flame King’s den.

“How is that possible…?” Lin Yun was shocked when he heard that. He had once heard from the Asura Dove King that the Blood Flame King was terrifying, and the Asura Dove King was afraid of just mentioning the Blood Flame King. Lin Yun was shocked that the three holy lands eradicated the Blood Flame King.

“This is normal. They’re ancient holy lands that we’re talking about. They naturally have a stronger foundation than the Blood Flame King. All of them have fourth-stage Saint Lords and Fourspirit Glory Saint Artifacts in their groups. So it’s unsure if they have more trump cards. In a nutshell, they have obtained a huge harvest this time,” Li Feibai sighed. “Liu Yunlan, the Heavenly Kui Saint Lord, and Huang Jingyu have benefited greatly with their cultivation reaching the second-stage Saint Lord. I heard that they have found several Myriad Demon Fruits and divine blood. Once they leave this place, they can swiftly become a third-stage Saint Lord.”

Lin Yun smiled when he heard that, but his smile was cold.

“Don’t tell me that you plan on taking revenge?” Li Feibai said, “Bear with it for now. They’re in the spotlight, and a breakthrough will allow their strength to undergo a drastic transformation. After all…”

“After all, I’m only a Quasi-Saint, right?” Lin Yun smiled.

“You’re grudgeful. I don’t dare to underestimate you now,” Li Feibai couldn’t help smiling as she replied. “They have more people, and you have the Divine Blood Fruit on you. If you show yourself, who knows how many people might come after you.”

Li Feibai was straightforward in her laughter. She took it well even when the brutal reality was placed before her.

Lin Yun briefly pondered, but he wasn’t in a hurry to take revenge. After all, he had already obtained the Divine Blood Fruit and met Su Ziyao, completing the two objectives of why he was here. So, leaving the Heavenly Void like this wasn’t a bad choice. But he didn’t forget what Su Ziyao said to him and asked, “Has the divine flames appeared?”

“You want to get involved in that mess? I’m planning on leaving,” Li Feibai said seriously.

Lin Yun nodded his head and said nothing.

Seeing Lin Yun’s determination, Li Feibai no longer said anything against it and replied, “I don’t mind telling you about it, but you have to keep a low profile. Otherwise, you will be in danger again after you just came out of the Fallen God Valley.”

“Don’t worry about it. I have always kept a low profile,” Lin Yun smiled.
