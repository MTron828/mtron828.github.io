Chapter 765 - Draconic Banquet’s Arrival

It was just as Lin Yun had expected. Qin Yang was waiting for him in the main hall, so he understood what was going on.

“Congratulations, Pavilion Master Plum for reaching the Heavenly Soul Realm. It’s really not easy for the Great Qin Empire to nurture a Heavenly Soul Realm expert.” The old man standing beside Qin Yang narrowed his smile and said, “Sorry, we came in a hurry and didn’t prepare any gifts for you.”

When everyone heard that, they knew that the Profound Yang Palace wasn’t here to congratulate him. There was another reason why they were visiting, but Pavilion Master Plum still responded to the old man courteously.

“Young Master Lin, how have you been since we last met in Swordmire City?” Qin Yang smiled.

“Good,” replied Lin Yun.

“Well, it hasn’t been good for me.” Qin Yang’s face sank as a terrifying aura leaked out of his body. His aura instantly set the entire hall ablaze and the elders had to circulate their origin energy to resist Qin Yang’s aura. But they soon realized in shock that the aura actually infiltrated their bodies and began to burn their origin energy.

The moment they circulated their cultivation technique, their body would start to feel a burning sensation while their faces turned red. Everyone instantly knew that Qin Yang was trying to establish his prestige.

Pavilion Master Plum snorted as his sword aura suppressed Qin Yang’s blazing aura. Only then, did the elders feel relieved. But cold sweat still dripped from their foreheads. When they looked at Qin Yang, all of their faces were ugly.

Qin Yang raised his brow. Seeing that Pavilion Master Plum was about to chase them away, he smiled, “Relax. I’m not here to show off the Profound Yang Palace’s power, nor am I here to show off my status as a genius on the Dragoncloud Ranking. I’m only here to take something back from Brother Lin.”

“I don’t remember owing you anything.” Lin Yun replied casually as he wasn’t afraid of Qin Yang.

“Cut the crap. Do you think you can kill the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape if it wasn’t for me?” Qin Yang’s eyes flashed with rage as his face sank.

“Young Master Qin, this is the Sword Firmament Pavilion. I advise you to be more polite with your words.” Pavilion Master Plum’s eyes sank as his eyes flashed sharply. The Profound Yang Palace might be one of the nine overlord forces, but they must be dreaming if they think that they could bully the Sword Firmament Pavilion with just that.

As the atmosphere became tense, the old man smiled, “Relax. Qin Yang is a little anxious and I will punish him when we get back. Speaking of which, your sect’s disciple did obtain something he didn’t deserve in the beast tide, which many cultivators in Swordmire City witnessed. The Profound Yang Palace won’t bully others. If this young lad is willing to return the beast core, we’re willing to exchange it with pellets of equivalent value.”

Lin Yun sneered inwardly as these people were really shameless. Back in Swordmire City, Qin Yang was heavily injured by the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape because he was careless. He even told everyone that Lin Yun only managed to obtain the beast core because of him. Lin Yun couldn’t be bothered with him back then, but he never expected that they were so shameless to come to him.

“Lil’ Purple, someone is looking for you to ask about the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape’s beast core,” yelled Lin Yun. In the next second, a beast roar echoed out. The shockwave left many people shocked, especially Qin Yang and the old man because this was the aura of a monarch demonic beast.

“What do you mean?” Qin Yang looked at Lin Yun coldly.

“I’ll be honest with you. The beast core was already refined, but you can recoup your losses against this new beast. Here is some friendly advice, its beast core is a hundred times more precious than the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape’s beast core. Hmmm, I’m worried that you don’t have the guts though,” replied Lin Yun casually.

“You think I don’t dare?” Qin Yang sneered. “It’s just a little beast from the Sword Firmament Pavilion. Lin Yun, you have no idea how terrifying a top-tiered genius is. Monarch demonic beast? So what? I can easily slay it.”

The moment he finished, Qin Yang flashed and left the hall. Clearly, he thought the monarch demonic beast was the demonic beast protecting the Sword Firmament Pavilion, so he didn’t place it in his eyes. After all, the Great Qin Empire’s spiritual energy was thin and a monarch demonic beast born here wouldn’t threaten him at all.

The old man smiled as he raised the teacup on the table. He didn’t stop the Qin Yang. But just when he was about to taste the tea, a figure rolled back into the hall. It was Qin Yang who had a trace of blood on the corner of his lips.

Qin Yang raised his head and looked at Lin Yun, “You fooled me!”

“What’s the matter?” The old man exclaimed.

“It’s the Indigothunder Dragonvulture!” Qin Yan’s words made the old man’s face change. Those who visited the Thunder Prefecture knew about the Indigothunder Dragonvulture. It was one of the strongest demonic beasts of the Thunder Prefecture. It possessed the dragon clan’s bloodline, so even overlord forces didn’t dare to provoke it.

The old man’s face sank and spoke coldly, “How dare you guys! Do you think you can disregard the Profound Yang Palace because of the Indigothunder Dragonvulture?”

The old man dropped his act and tried to suppress the Sword Firmament Pavilion with the Profound Yang Palace’s prestige.

But Pavilion Master Plum waved his hand and his sword flew over. Pavilion Master Plum held onto the sword and stood up, “The Sword Firmament Pavilion doesn’t dare to provoke the Profound Yang Palace. But if you guys continue to throw a fit here, I’ll show you that the Sword Firmament Pavilion has backbone. Either leave by yourself or I’ll send you off.”

The old man’s lips twitched as he never expected that Pavilion Master Plum would be so unyielding. Who would have thought that they would get chased out? It took a long time before the old man replied, “Let’s go.”

Qin Yang was reluctant to leave, but he looked at Lin Yun and said, “You! You better hope you don’t run into me at the Draconic Banquet.”

“So what if I run into you?” Lin Yun’s aloof attitude instantly turned sharp. This made Qin yang feel as though he was stabbed in his chest with his entire body turning cold.

Damn it! Qin Yang cursed inwardly before he turned and left. He no longer dared to look Lin Yun directly in the eyes anymore. The old man and Qin Yang came to the Sword Firmament Pavilion ferociously and never imagined that they would be forced to leave in this manner. The entire Sword Firmament Pavilion was terrifying like a sword as none of them feared death.

“It’s not good that you offended such a genius before the Draconic Banquet,” said Pavilion Master Plum with a worried tone.

“I’m not afraid of him,” replied Lin Yun.

“Don’t be careless. The Profound Yang Palace is still one of the nine overlord forces.” Pavilion Master Plum turned to look at Lin Yun and said, “Qin Yang is probably at a critical moment of making a breakthrough. Since the Draconic Banquet is only one month away, he won’t come and look for you anytime soon. You can take advantage of this for now and cultivate in the Sword Firmament Pavilion. You can go with the other titled figures to Dragoncloud City afterwards.”

Dragoncloud City was where the Draconic Banquet was held. It was an ancient city that symbolized the dragon fortune. There were nine such ancient cities in the Profound Amber Realm and they had existed ever since the golden era.

After Lin Yun left, Pavilion Master Plum looked at the Sword-Bearing Elders and said, “Everyone, what do you think of Lin Yun? How far do you think he can go in the Draconic Banquet?”

“He’s strong, unbelievably strong.”

“I can no longer see through him and I might not even be able to defeat him. I heard that this Draconic Banquet is the most exciting one over the past few millennia. In fact, more and more geniuses have appeared over the past few years.”

“He seems like he’s able to compete with Qin Yang head-on. He might have been serious when he said that he wasn’t afraid of Qin Yang.” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Does that mean Lin Yun has the qualification to enter the top thirty?” Everyone was discussing their opinions and they were terrified by their conclusion. It had been centuries since someone from the Sword Firmament Pavilion made it onto the Dragoncloud Ranking. But even if they made it, they were always ranked towards the bottom.

The top thirty were geniuses that even core disciples of overlord forces could only dream of becoming. Knowing this, it was easy to imagine how terrifying Qin Yang was. After all, Qin Yang had left a deep impression in the mind of all the Sword-Bearing Elders.

Pavilion Master Plum shook his head and said, “The world is changing. Four years ago, no one aside from the three kings and seven elites had shown any worth. Qin Yang might seem terrifying, but he is also under great pressure, which is why he came for the beast core.”

Pavilion Master Plum’s eye was terrifying as he instantly detected the worries concealed in Qin Yang’s heart. After all, Qin Yang lost to some newly risen geniuses during the beast tide, not to mention that he was suppressed by the likes of Wu Xiaotian. With no harvest from the beast tide, Qin Yang’s only hope was to come looking for Lin Yun.

Pavilion Master Plum continued, “It will be hard for Qin Yang to make it into the top thirty again. As for Lin Yun, I feel that he can even compete to make it into the top ten.”

“Are you serious?”

“Pavilion Master, did you manage to guess something?” Pavilion Master Plum’s words had shocked the seven Sword-Bearing Elders.

“It’s a secret,” replied Pavilion Master Plum..
