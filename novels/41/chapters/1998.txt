Chapter 1999 - Demonspirit's Physique

After Xiao Jingyan revealed his true identity, his strength was greatly boosted, with his speed and strength drastically rising. He could easily unleash one-tenth of the Stalewater Sword with a simple swing of his sword. With one-tenth of the Stalewater Sword’s power and Xiao Jingyan’s strength, the power of his attack was terrifying.

The power of his attack was immense, and there was nowhere to hide. Left with no choice, Lin Yun could only activate the glory spirits within the Flower Burial Sword and faced it head-on.

The Flower Burial Sword trembled, and Lin Yun could feel his hand becoming numb, taking a few steps back. The power of Xiao Jingyan’s sword was too strong.

Lin Yun frowned because there was a huge gap between their cultivations. Now that Xiao Jingyan had the Stalewater Sword, the difference between them had gotten even bigger. If he was hit by the attack head-on, he would immediately be heavily injured. He only had the advantage of his attainment in the sword, Azure Dragon Sword Heart, and Astral Sword Intent. There was also the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella, but that was his last resort. If he failed to kill Xiao Jingyan, his identity would be instantly exposed.

Lin Yun and Xiao Jingyan clashed over ten-odd times in the blink of an eye. Xiao Jingyan was fearless as he faced Lin Yun, fearlessly relying on the Stalewater Sword and his Demonspirit’s physique to suppress Lin Yun.

“So what if your sword techniques are powerful? You’re nothing before absolute power!” Xiao Jingyan maniacally laughed. With the Stalewater Sword in his hand, he wouldn’t even fear someone at the Azure Origin Phase of the Quasi-Saint Realm, not to mention Ye Qingtian, who was only at the fifth transformation of the Nirvana Stage.

The phenomena created by the Stalewater Sword was massive, and had locked onto Lin Yun. As the two fought, hundreds and thousands of sword auras would ripple out, flying towards the sky, earth, or turning into howling winds. At the same time, Lin Yun and Xiao Jingyan also had powerful movement techniques.

The surroundings were covered with their afterimages, and those afterimages were real, looking like spatial disorders from afar. After eighty clashes later, Lin Yun clashed with Xiao Jingyan once more. The Flower Burial Sword was practically knocked away from his hand, but Lin Yun strengthened his grip on it. He already began to bleed from his palm, which flowed down the sword.

“I’m impressed that you have yet to summon your constellation!” Xiao Jingyan snorted. He had an advantage in his cultivation, not to mention he still had the Stalewater Sword. So it should be a one-sided battle, but as they fought, Xiao Jingyan realized that Ye Qingtian’s nirvana aura had reached over a hundred thousand strands.

This naturally made him shocked because many experts at the ninth transformation of the Nirvana Stage didn’t even have a hundred thousand strands.

Lin Yun’s gaze was cold and ignored Xiao Jingyan’s words.

“Lin Yun, why don’t you escape first? Even if you use the Azure Dragon Sword heart and Astral Sword Intent, the best you can do is inflict heavy injuries on him, and you might not be able to kill him. But once your trump cards are revealed, it’ll be harder for you to kill him again. This fellow is experienced in battle, and it’s too weird, even if he’s a Demonspirit. If you can’t kill him in one go, it’ll only be troublesome.” Lil’ Purple’s voice resounded.

“I’m trying.” Lin Yun controlled the Flower Burial Sword as it flew out, executing the Divine Firefly Sword.

“Firefly Radiance!”

“Dawn Radiance!”

“Sunset Radiance!”

“Waning Moon!”

“Heavenly Snowing Mountain!” The Flower Burial Sword looked as though it was being controlled by someone to execute the sword techniques, and it wasn’t at all weaker than when Lin Yun was executing them himself.

Lin Yun took a deep breath and circulated the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra, with Netherflowers flying out from his body. With his hands together, Netherflowers arranged themselves behind him. Netherflowers were nobles at night, and they were like a wall behind him. He hovered in the air, then flicked his finger when the Netherflowers bloomed, executing the Flicking Divine Finger.

In the next second, thousands of sword rays flew out from the Netherflowers behind him. Lin Yun might seem to be multitasking, but he was linked with the Flower Burial Sword throughout the process. Then again, he didn’t need to spend much energy on the Flower Burial Sword.

The sword rays left holes on the phenomena created by the Stalewater Sword. This made Xiao Jingyan squint his pupils before he used his full strength to knock the Flower Burial Sword away. But the Flower Burial Sword soon returned and tangled with him. In just a brief moment, Xiao Jingyan’s body was riddled with hundreds of sword rays, including his heart.

“Damn it!” Xiao Jingyan gritted his teeth in pain and let out a roar as a pair of demonic wings appeared behind him, full of demonic radiance. The wings were supported by a skeletal frame, and this increased his speed even further.

“His sword intent is too terrifying, and I’ll be exhausted sooner or later. I have to deal severe injuries on him.” Xiao Jingyan changed his mind. He took the Flower Burial Sword’s attacks head-on and chased after Lin Yun.

The Golden Crow Wings also appeared behind Lin Yun, and he quickly retreated when he flapped the wings. As Lin Yun tapped his fingers, the wall of Netherflowers behind him began to bloom. Hundreds and thousands of sword rays shot towards Xiao Jingyan as Lin Yun waved his hands.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Xiao Jingyan was covered in blood as he charged over, but he disregarded his injuries like a madman. Not knowing how long later, the Netherflowers behind Lin Yun began to wither.

“An opportunity!” Xiao Jingyan’s eyes lit up and accelerated his speed, swinging the Stalewater Sword.

“Indigothunder Azurefrost!” Xiao Jingyan was also using the Divine Firefly Sword, but he naturally didn’t reach Lin Yun’s height. Even so, close to three hundred thousand strands of nirvana aura were poured into this attack, allowing his attack to reach a terrifying height.

But Lin Yun seemed to be prepared as the Golden Crow Wings opened up, and he avoided the incoming attack before throwing punches out, unleashing sword rays through his fists to destroy Xiao Jingyan’s attack.

When Xiao Jingyan raised his head, Lin Yun already soared to the sky and came behind him. Xiao Jingyan quickly turned around, but it was already too late. Lin Yun had grasped his flaw at that moment. As the Golden Crow Wings shone, the Heavenly Dragon and Divine Phoenix Seals bloomed in both of his hands, with the Heavenly Dragon in his left and Divine Phoenix in his right.

As two sword rays intersected and struck Xiao Jingyan, the Heavenly Dragon and Divine Phoenix dashed forth. This nearly severed Xiao Jingyan’s body into two, revealing his bones, which were cracking. But even so, Xiao Jingyan still didn’t suffer any heavy injuries because he was recovering at a rapid speed.

Demonic energy had enveloped his wounds, and he was recovering with his flesh wriggling. This naturally made Lin Yun take a deep breath and wondered if Xiao Jingyan was still human.

“Lin Yun, his eyes.” Lil’ Purple’s voice resounded.

When Lin Yun raised his head, he saw a vertical eye on Xiao Jingyan’s forehead, surging with a terrifying, torrential demonic aura.

“Sword!” Lin Yun waved his arms and the two wings slashed down, instantly reaching Xiao Jingyan. He didn’t stop there and reached out to grab the Flower Burial Sword before executing the Light of the Beginning without any hesitation. This time, his sword was aimed at the eye on Xiao Jingyan’s forehead.

“No!” Xiao Jingyan was frightened by this and quickly shut his third eye. When he shut his third eye, his aura began to drop and his body returned to his original human appearance while the sword landed on Xiao Jingyan’s forehead.

“Hehe. I can actually dodge your sword, but I need you to take the initiative to give me an opportunity!” Xiao Jingyan laughed as he swung the Stalewater Sword.

Lin Yun was already exhausted and had less than one-tenth of his nirvana aura remaining. Just when the sword was about to reach him, Lil’ Purple flew out from the sword box and dragged Lin Yun by his shoulder to dodge this sword. But a portion of the attack still landed on Lin Yun’s chest, leaving behind a deep wound that showed his bones.

“A little girl?” Xiao Jingyan coughed, looking at Lin Yun who had already ran away. He wanted to chase after Ye Qingtian, but he didn’t make a rash move. In the end, he roared, “Why is that bastard so hard to kill?!”

He began to suspect that Wang Muyan knew something and let him take the risk on purpose. The more he thought about it, the more he felt that he was fooled by the Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden. If he didn’t have so many trump cards, he would have died long ago, just like Ye Qinghong.

After Lin Yun had flown a few hundred miles away, he stopped and executed the Divine Tortoise Transformation to conceal his aura. After he was done, he sat down to activate the Blue Dragon Bone, and his injuries began to recover at a rapid speed. But the wounds left behind by the powerful martial intent and the Stalewater Sword couldn’t be recovered so quickly.

Fifteen minutes later when Lin Yun opened his eyes, he had recovered some of his nirvana aura and fled for another few hundred miles before he calmed down. Lin Yun turned to Lil’ Purple and asked, “Empress, is the Demonspirit Clan that hard to kill?”

“I’ve never interacted with the Demonspirit Clan before. Xiao Jingyan is only an ordinary Demonspirit. If he’s a Silver-Eyed Demonspirit, you probably wouldn’t be safe, even if you brought out the Sovereign Saint Artifact,” Lil’ Purple sighed.

“Well, that’s true,” Lin Yun replied. He had interacted with a Silver-Eyed Demonspirit back in the Ancient Barren Battlefield. That Silver-Eyed Demonspirit was restrained by the Nether Shackles, but it was still incredibly powerful.

“If they’re not strong, the Darkest Era wouldn’t have lasted for a hundred thousand years. I already said that darkness will return. The Nine Emperors probably didn’t kill them all,” Lil’ Purple said. In that era, humans were nothing but livestock. Only the holy lands and Ancient Saint Clans could protect the region they were in. But low-leveled cultivators had to worry about living for another day, and it was an era without any hope.

Lin Yun was also inwardly concerned because that meant that the peace that was maintained for three thousand years would be disrupted.

Lil’ Purple said, “I should’ve guessed that they must be planning something big to look for the Divine Solar Lunar Rune!”

“Wang Muyan!” Lin Yun’s pupils radiated with murderous intent because this must be related to her.

“Don’t think about that for now. You should think of how to deal with Xiao Jingyan. You have to kill him, not just defeat him!” Lil’ Purple said.

“I roughly have an idea now,” Lin Yun replied. As he spoke, he took out the Three-Lives Fruit with one last attempt left. The Serene Dust Great Saint gave him a lot of resources, and he didn’t need to worry about resources until he reached the Saint Realm; he just needed time.

Xiao Jingyan was too strong, and Lin Yun had to make a breakthrough before using the Astral Sword Intent and Azure Dragon Sword Heart if Lin Yun wanted to kill him. He had to give it his all to take Xiao Jingyan’s life.
