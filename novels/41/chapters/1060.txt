Chapter 1061 - Sword of the Beginning

Land of the Battle of Gods? Lin Yun was briefly stunned when he heard that. Then, he turned around and smiled, “Weiwei, you’re awake!”

“Hmph, you’re finally calling me Weiwei now!” Yue Weiwei’s face became rosy once more as her eyes shined brightly. Her eyes were spiritual and captivating, just like before. Additionally, her charming and bewitching temperament were back.

Lin Yun was briefly stunned before he recovered from Yue Weiwei’s beauty. He knew the difference between Yue Weiwei and Weiwei, so he forced out a smile. “Maybe because it sounded more proper back then.”

“Hmph, you’re not allowed to call me that way anymore. Otherwise, I won’t call you Big Brother Yun anymore.” Yue Weiwei smiled and jumped off of Lil’ Red. Then, she looked at the corpse and said, “Whose corpse is this?” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Yu Haotian,” said Lin Yun calmly.

“Good. If he didn’t die, he would end becoming a formidable foe in the future. He should have died in the Profound Amber Realm. He’s lucky that he made it this far in the Heavenly Path.” Yue Weiwei didn’t have a favorable opinion about Yu Haotian. They had a grudge back in the banquet, not to mention that he was also an enemy of Lin Yun. After a brief pause, Yue Weiwei looked up ahead and continued, “Big Brother Yun, do you know what the Land of the Battle of Gods is?”

“Is it where the battles between gods take place? I heard that places like this can give birth to a Divine Blood Fruit,” said Lin Yun. He didn’t know much about the Land of the Battle of Gods, but he did manage to get some information from Pei Xue.

Yue Weiwei looked at Lin Yun and smiled, “It looks like Big Brother Yun has some knowledge about the Land of the Battle of Gods. But not all Land of the Battle of Gods can give birth to the Divine Blood Fruit. The region needs blood from the gods and it also needs luck.

“The battle between gods is extremely complicated. First, it’s rare for a god to bleed. Second, it’s more rare for a god to fall. It seems like there were many gods heavily injured in the Land of the Battle of Gods, which is why the will in their divine blood still hasn’t dissipated,” explained Yue Weiwei.

“A god’s will doesn’t have to dissipate? Exactly how strong were they?” Lin Yun was shocked.

“I’m not sure,” said Yue Weiwei with a grave expression. “After the golden age, the last god fell. There hasn't been a birth of a new god ever since. No one really knows how strong the gods were, but we have some information from ancient records.”

As she spoke, the silver bracelet on her wrist began to shine. When Lin Yun looked at it, he could see densely packed saint runes that were engraved on the bracelet. Yue Weiwei began to pour her origin energy into the bracelet, which caused a spatial fluctuation that made a mirror appear in Yue Weiwei’s hand.

She was wearing an interspatial bracelet, which was superior to interspatial pouches. After all, it had a larger storage space. Furthermore, there was a miniature array among the saint runes that needed origin energy to activate. However, since her meridians were sealed before, she couldn’t use the bracelet. Despite being unable to use the bracelet, no one could take it off her. Otherwise, they would have to deal with the array on the bracelet.

Lin Yun was curious about the bracelet, but he was even more curious about the mirror that Yue Weiwei was holding.

“This is the Time-Turning Mirror. It can turn back time. If there were powerful gods fighting here, there will be traces even if a hundred thousand years have passed. I can use this mirror to find the Divine Blood Fruit,” said Yue Weiwei.

“Divine Blood Fruit?” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed when he heard that.

“We won’t be able to see anything here, but this forbidden region is definitely a Land of the Battle of Gods. There’s a high chance that a Divine Blood Fruit is around here,” said Yue Weiwei. Then, she gently waved the mirror in her hand and unleashed beams of light into the forbidden region.

In the next second, heaven and earth began to change as countless scenes appeared in the depth of the forbidden region. Countless stars fell as the battle between the gods was blurred and distorted. One thing that Lin Yun noticed immediately was that the ancient Heavenly Path was unlike the Heavenly Path now. It was unimaginably massive.

Suddenly, Lin Yun saw a flash of light before him. When the sword ray flashed, it felt like countless years had passed in the blink of an eye. Then, Lin Yun saw a figure fighting a god. The god let out a painful cry and was sent flying while his blood was vaporized. The immense power formed a terrifying black hole as nine dazzling droplets of blood fell to the ground.

“Over there!” Lin Yun was fully entranced by the profundity of the sword, so Yue Weiwei’s voice startled him awake. When Lin Yun raised his head, the scene in the sky had already disappeared.

Without any hesitation, Yue Weiwei rode Lil’ Red towards the location where the droplets of blood fell. Lin Yun followed closely behind and after an hour, they stopped at a cliff. The cliff was terrifyingly dark as the abyss below looked like it would swallow their souls.

“It should be somewhere here. There were nine total droplets of divine blood.” Yue Weiwei looked at the abyss and took out the Time-Turning Mirror before shining it below the cliff. When the Time-Turning Mirror faced a direction and shot a beam out, a golden fruit appeared in Yue Weiwei and Lin Yun’s sight.

The golden fruit had seven leaves and emitted an unrivaled aura. With just one glance, Lin Yun felt the urge to eat the fruit. The temptation was great, but Lin Yun managed to hold himself back with his sword intent.

“Stop!” When he saw Yue Weiwei walking towards the cliff, his face changed. He quickly pulled her back, which forced her to fall on top of him. Lowering his head, Lin Yun looked at Yue Weiwei and asked, “Are you alright?”

Yue Weiwei was startled awake as fear flashed through her pupils. “It actually has seven divine leaves. How unbelievable! The other three Divine Blood Fruits didn’t have a single leaf. The leaves and fruit cannot be refined, but there’s dew on the leaves. If it’s only the dew, Big Brother Yun, you can give it a try.”

Yue Weiwei only thought about helping Lin Yun instead of herself. So when she looked at Lin Yun to encourage him, she was shocked. Panic filled her face as she watched blood drip from Lin Yun’s eyes. With a napkin, she wiped the blood off of Lin Yun’s face and said, “Big Brother Yun, why are your eyes bleeding?”

After hearing Yue Weiwei’s words, Lin Yun realized that there was a stinging pain in his eyes. He quickly closed his eyes and opened them again, but blood was still flowing from his eyes. Lin Yun furrowed his brows as he touched the blood on his face. He had no idea when he suffered this injury. “This is weird.”

If this went on, there was a high possibility that he would go blind. Suddenly, Yue Weiwei thought of something and asked nervously, “Big Brother Yun, did you see anything in the fight between the gods?”

“It was blurry in the beginning, but I managed to see a wisp of sword ray,” said Lin Yun. Could it be that the sword ray was the cause?

Yue Weiwei’s face changed when she heard that and said, “This is bad.”

“You didn’t see that sword ray?” asked Lin Yun.

“I didn’t,” responded Yue Weiwei.

Everything started to make sense. The problem was due to the sword ray. Maybe it was because of his sky sword intent that he saw the sword ray. Then again, it was fortunate that he only saw a wisp of the sword ray. Otherwise, he would be dead right now. Luckily, the wisp alone was enough to fill Lin Yun with dao rhyme profundities.

This meant that there was a wisp of sword ray lingering in his pupils that would blind him if he couldn’t refine it. But refining it was the same as fighting the god that he watched. It was practically an impossible act for the current Lin Yun.

As he pondered, Yue Weiwei took out a piece of white cloth and rubbed some medicine on it. THen, she tied it around Lin Yun’s eyes.

“Sword of the Beginning,” muttered Lin Yun.

“What?” Yue Weiwei asked nervously.

“That’s the name of the sword ray. I just realized it. Perhaps I might have a chance to refine this wisp of sword ray,” said Lin Yun. “Maybe I can also give the Divine Blood Fruit an attempt.”

Although he couldn’t see anything right now, he could sense everything with his origin energy and sword intent. If he couldn’t see the Divine Blood Fruit clearly, perhaps he might be able to resist the temptation. After all, those who saw the Divine Blood Fruit weren’t able to resist its temptation. Plus, they wouldn’t be able to close their eyes when facing it. But now, Lin Yun couldn’t even open his eyes no matter how tempted he was.

“Are you really able to do it?” Yue Weiwei asked anxiously.

Lin Yun wasn’t entirely confident because there might be dangers in the abyss, but he still wanted to give it a go.
