Chapter 1505 - Refining the Divine Golden Crow Iron

When they found the nirvana node, they swiftly left this place and reappeared in the cave again. Lin Yun knew that he had traveled through time when he went through the nirvana node.

“That is a really magical place!” Xiao Yun exclaimed as he looked around. “This might be a nirvana node!”

Lin Yun was surprised when he heard that because he didn’t think Xiao Yun would know about the nirvana node.

“Nirvana node?” An Liuyan fell into deep thoughts when she heard that. She seemed to have heard of it before but couldn’t recall it. She could only speculate that this was related to the nirvana node, and there weren’t many people who could control a nirvana node since ancient times.

But it was hard to control, and only a few powerhouses could accomplish that. As for the literature left behind, that was even less.

“Hehe, the two of you don’t know about it?” Xiao Yun smiled with surprise flashing across his pupils.

“Hmph.” An Liuyan was unhappy with Xiao Yun. She suppressed her curiosity and no longer cared about him.

When Xiao Yun turned to look at Lin Yun, he noticed Lin Yun was observing the surrounding walls, and he seemed to be recording something. But Lin Yun had no intention of asking him about the nirvana node, which instantly placed Xiao Yun in an awkward position.

“Big Brother Yun, what are you doing?” Xiao Yun stepped forth, and had now addressed Lin Yun as ‘big brother’. After all, Lin Yun killed Ku Ying, who made him suffer a lot.Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“This wall seems to be indestructible.” One could find the nirvana node as long as one spent the time and effort to do so, and Lin Yun wanted to bury Xie Feng’s party in it. After all, he couldn’t afford the secret of the radiant saint artifact to spread.

“Hehe. We share the same thoughts. It’s best not to let others know about this place. Big Brother Lin, you go rest and leave it to me!” Xiao Yun took out a spiritual rune brush and engraved saint runes on the surrounding walls. With his attainment in spiritual runes, saint runes were easily drawn by him.

“Retreat!” When he was done, Xiao Yun retreated with Lin Yun and An Liuyan before he clasped his hands together, and this region began to collapse.

This made Lin Yun look at Xiao Yun with a higher view, which was pretty impressive. He was sure that the wall was so tough that he couldn’t leave any mark on it even with his firmament sword intent, but Xiao Yun easily caused it to crumble. When the cave was turned into a pile of ruins, the three swiftly left and found a secluded place in the desert.

“Let’s divide the saint fruits.” Lin Yun looked at Xiao Yun and asked, “How many saint fruits have you got?”

“Not much. I found ten-odd varieties with my Profound Yin Saint Eyes.” Xiao Yun said as he took out various saint fruits.

Lin Yun no longer spoke and took out ten-odd varieties of saint fruits. Then again, he only had one Demon-Refining Fruit. So he couldn't share it. One could only refine one of each variety of saint fruit, and the second would be useless. So the benefits would be maximized by exchanging amongst themselves.

Xiao Yun was stumped when he saw Lin Yun's saint fruits. Lin Yun actually had more saint fruits than him. They soon exchanged saint fruits that they hadn’t consumed before.

Seven days later, a boundless aura flowed over An Liuyan and Xiao Yun’s bodies like flowing light. They both opened their eyes at the same time. They both reached the pinnacle of seven-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm after consuming ten-odd saint fruits, with their astral energy ocean and innate saint auras have reached a terrifying height.

They both turned to look at Lin Yun. Lin Yun was still refining the saint fruits, giving off a holy light from his body. This made his body look like a flawless scripture.

“Why is he still refining saint fruits?” Xiao Yun asked.

Since Lin Yun had previously consumed many saint fruits, there were only a few saint fruits that he hadn’t refined, unlike the two of them. So logically speaking, he should’ve woken up a long time ago.

“That’s…” An Liuyan’s eyes flashed with surprise as she looked at the saint fruit in Lin Yun’s hand.

“The Demon-Refining Fruit!” Xiao Yun exclaimed as his pupils squinted.

“Why are you so loud?!” An Liuyan glared at him. Did this person not know that Lin Yun was refining the saint fruit? What if his loud voice disturbed him?

Xiao Yun awkwardly smiled when he heard that and quickly covered his mouth. Still, he couldn’t hide the shock in his eyes. After all, that was the Demon-Refining Fruit they were talking about, and at least five hundred saints were hanging on that tree. So one Demon-Refining Fruit was probably equivalent to the dozens in their hands.

An hour later, Lin Yun finally let out a breath, which lasted for a long time, and the breath gradually became thinner, and it looked thinner than hair. This made An Liuyan and Xiao Yun’s faces change because it was rare for anyone to achieve this, aside from Dragon Pulse Realm experts who had condensed their dragon origin. Those strands meant Lin Yun could kill his enemies from thousands of meters away.

“The Demon-Refining Fruit is really a treasure, but this fruit hasn’t ripped yet…” Lin Yun said, looking at the shriveled fruit that had lost its spiritual energy. He made tremendous progress in his cultivation this time and now had six stars in his violet palace. This meant that he had reached the six-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm.

His astral energy ocean reached an exaggerated size of 30,000 feet, and his innate saint aura reached 5,000. It was rare for an ordinary genius to reach 10,000 feet in their astral energy ocean. Since eight-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm experts could bring out eight times their base cultivation, they could bring out the power of 80,000 feet of astral energy ocean.

But Lin Yun had a strong foundation and was stronger than those people, even if he was only at the six-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm. If he utilized the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron, the power he could bring out would be even more powerful.

Xie Feng’s astral energy ocean should’ve been around 20,000 feet, or he wouldn’t have been able to make Lin Yun feel so pressured. But if Lin Yun ran into him again, he was confident he could face Xie Feng or even suppress him.

The feeling of being suppressed felt terrible. The Golden Crow Wings were destroyed, his cultivation was suppressed, and not even his firmament sword intent could cover the difference.

When Lin Yun stood up, An Liuyan and Xiao Yun felt significantly pressured. They could feel that Lin Yun had undergone a drastic change after refining that Demon-Refining Fruit and this made them suffer a setback when they had just become confident from the boost of their strength.

Lin Yun smiled, “I need a favor from you both.”

“What favor? Big Brother Lin, just say the word.” Xiao Yun laughed as he patted his chest.

An Liuyan gave a wink, and she didn’t have to speak for others to understand her meaning.

“I need to refine one more thing, and the commotion will be huge. It’ll be dangerous. So I need you two to protect me. If someone comes, help me kill them, or it’ll be very troublesome for me.” Lin Yun said in a solemn voice.

Lin Yun intended to refine the Divine Golden Crow Iron. The process would be dangerous, and his body would blow apart if he wasn’t careful. He initially planned to refine it after reaching the Dragon Pulse Realm, but Lin Yun was somewhat unconvinced when his Golden Crow Wings were destroyed by Xie Feng earlier.

Not to mention that Xie Feng’s strength was nothing compared to the top geniuses of the seven demonic sects and those old monsters who reached the nine-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm. There was a massive gap between him and them, and he needed to upgrade his Golden Grow Wings.

“That’s simple. I’ll set up a nine-layered spiritual array for you!” Xiao Yun smiled. This was his specialty.

When Xiao Yun set up the spiritual arrays, An Liuyan took out a jade pendant from a surprising spot. The jade pendant was buried deep in her cleavage, making the corner of Lin Yun’s lip twitch.

“This is called the Heavenly Heart Jade Talisman, containing a droplet of Heavenly Divine Frost Fire. It can ensure your safety no matter what you are refining!” An Liuyan naturally said before she put it on Lin Yun’s neck before he could say a thing.

When the talisman stuck onto his chest, Lin Yun could feel a chilling aura, and his aura immediately calmed down. He instantly knew this was a treasure and smiled at An Liuyan.

After Xiao Yun set up the nine-layered spiritual array, this region was isolated from the outside world, and no one would notice them, regardless of the commotion they caused.

Lin Yun then took out the Divine Golden Crow Iron. The Divine Golden Crow Iron had a tough surface, and it was covered with faint runes. It was the Divine Golden Crow’s blood, and the value wasn’t any lower than Divine Dragon Bones. To a certain degree, it was even more precious, and this was the Divine Golden Crow Iron given to him by Mu Xuankong.

Taking a deep breath, Lin Yun hovered the Divine Golden Crow Iron before him. When he poured his astral energy into it, the surface of the Divine Golden Crow Iron began to melt, and traces of cracks began to appear.

A majestic divine aura swept out as golden light shone from the cracks. Then, a series of explosions resounded from within the Divine Golden Crow Iron. When the surface of the Divine Golden Crow Iron fell off, a liquified golden metal was emitting a dazzling radiance that looked like boiling magma.

Since it was too dazzling, it became this region's sole light source. Simultaneously, cracks began to appear on the ground, and the ground soon became charred. The talisman stuck to Lin Yun’s chest emitted a faint light, and a cold aura swept throughout his body.

A white membrane appeared on the surface of his body, resisting the heatwave that was sweeping through his body. Aside from the heatwave and pressure, a piercing aura swept out that left cracks in the surrounding air. Lin Yun took a deep breath with a grave expression as he slowly directed the Divine Golden Crow Iron towards himself.
