Chapter 828 - Someone Who Buries Flowers!

Empowered by the Azure Dragon Sword Aura, the Great Wind Scripture manifested into an azure dragon. The dragon and Lin Yun soared into the sky to meet Yan Long’zi’s punch.

Yan Long’zi’s attack began to crumble along with his meteor shower. However, Lin Yun didn’t let up as he unleashed a boundless killing aura. His killing aura continued to rise until it spread throughout every corner of the stage. Lin Yun was utilizing the Seven Slaughtering Fist.

Lin Yun unleashed an unprecedented killing aura and revealed his ferocious side. His punch landed on Yan Long’zi’s chest, which shattered Yan Long’zi’s aura. Then, he was sent flying across the stage while spitting up blood.

But before Yan Long’zi could get up, Lin Yun’s face flashed with even more dense killing aura. With a dazzling golden brilliance, Lin Yun sped across the stage. Unable to react, all Yan Long’zi could see was a golden radiance. With unparalleled ferocity, Lin Yun punched Yan Long’zi in the face. The punch had the might of a sword and a dragon, causing Yan Long’zi’s face to sink in. Yan Long’zi slowly looked up as blood dripped from his nose and mouth.

“Is this all you got? Aren’t you one of the three kings?” asked Lin Yun coldly.

Yan Long’zi staggered back to his feet as his face distorted from the swelling and pain. No one would have guessed that Lin Yun had the advantage in physique. The Azure Dragon Sword Aura was terrifying, which made Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon Battle Physique even stronger.

Is Lin Yun going to beat him? An outrageous thought crossed everyone’s mind that didn’t seem so outrageous anymore.

“I really underestimated you. You do have the qualification to not use your sword…” Yan Long’zi wiped his blood as his eyes flashing coldly, “But this is the end. You’re about to die!”

Yan Long’zi’s clothes suddenly exploded and all of his muscles swelled. A golden luster covered the surface of his body and vaguely looked like a flame dragon. “Flame Dragon Vajra Physique?—Undying!”

A terrifying aura surged from Yan Long’zi as he brought out the trump card he used against Fang Hanluo. This was something that not even the quasi-spiritual sword intent could penetrate.

When the golden luster reached its limit, Yan Long’zi’s body was a lot bigger than Lin Yun. Yan Long’zi emitted a terrifying aura as he spoke with a dark face, “The outcome won’t change whether or not you draw your sword. Before absolute strength, there’s only one outcome to our fight, your death!”

At this moment, everyone could tell how strong Yan Long’zi’s killing intent was. With a burst of golden radiance, Yan Long’zi charged at Lin Yun in the blink of an eye.

Dragon runes began to squirm on Lin Yun’s body as lightning flickering all around him. His body released a reek of blood as the dragon runes turned into an ancient azure dragon that was imprinted on his body.

Simultaneously, Yan Long’zi’s punch reached Lin Yun and released an earth-shattering explosion.

“Sword!” Lin Yun summoned his sword and unleashed a sword ray at Yan Long’zi. When Yan Long’zi’s punch was about to reach him, Lin Yun’s sword split the flame intent in half. Then, he spread his arms apart and left behind afterimages all across the stage. While retreating, he poured his Azure Dragon Sword Aura into his sword and swung his sword three times. Each swing unleashed the Overlord Sword’s various forms, Thunderbolt Slash, Solar Slash, and Big Bang!

Lin Yun’s attacks instantly created three phenomena, a lightning storm, the rising sun, and a bright star. There was no way Yan Long’zi could take on the overlapping swords, so he was sent flying.

“Damn it! Flame Dragon Destruction!” roared Yan Long’zi. He didn’t expect Lin Yun’s sword aura to be so terrifying. In reality, Lin Yun’s sword never changed as he simply added his killing aura to the mix.

Lin Yun didn’t kill many people at the banquet and killed those who forced his hand. When it came to Yan Long’zi, Lin Yun couldn’t bear to be patient anymore and revealed his true self. There was no way Yan Long’zi’s killing aura could compare to his. After all, Lin Yun cultivated the Seven Slaughtering Fist.

Yan Long’zi had no idea how many life and death experiences Lin Yun had. He didn’t even know the amount of people Lin Yun killed along the way. However, Yan Long’zi was about to learn why Lin Yun was called Flower Burial.

At this moment, Yan Long’zi’s situation was unfavorable. Whenever Lin Yun’s sword clashed with Yan Long’zi’s body, sparks would fly across the stage. If it wasn’t for his strong physique, he would have died several deaths.

“Golden Dragon Vajra Physique–Explosion!” Golden brilliance exploded from Yan Long’zi’s body once more as he tried to turn the tide of the battle.

However, Lin Yun executed the Seven Profound Steps and appeared beside Yan Long’zi. Immediately, he brandished his sword at the center of Yan Long’zi’s forehead. Yan Long’zi was startled because he wasn’t eager to see how sharp Lin Yun’s sword was even with his powerful physique.

His physique was strong, but it wasn’t invincible. During the fight, Yan Long’zi realized that his flame intent was nearly torn to pieces by Lin Yun. The Azure Dragon Sword Aura that enveloped every corner of the stage was suffocating. They were both using their martial intent, but Lin Yun’s martial intent was on a completely different level than his.

“Flame Dragon Vajra Physique–Undying!” Yan Long’zi roared and put all of his hopes on his physique that couldn’t be pierced by a sword. Activating the wisp of flame dragon bloodline within his body, his aura became even more ferocious.

When the tip of Lin Yun’s sword landed on Yan Long’zi’s body, the former was sent flying while Yan Long’zi pounced forward.

Lin Yun left behind afterimages that were shattered by Yan Long’zi. After he found an opportunity, he swung his sword out, “Overlord Sword–Breaking Dawn!”

Taking Lin Yun’s attack head-on, traces of blood leaked out of the corner of Yan Long’zi’s lips as he took several steps back. Even with his full power, he couldn’t even touch the corner of Lin Yun’s clothes. Plus, he suffered internal injuries from Lin Yun’s attack. “You’re courting death!” yelled the enraged Yan Long’zi.

He then reached out with a flame dragon’s claw to hit Lin Yun. “I don’t believe that you can break my Flame Dragon Vajra Physique!”

Relying on his physique, Yan Long’zi charged forward once more without care for his life. He used a ferocious strategy to exchange injuries with Lin Yun.

Lin Yun had no change to his face as he executed the Cloudsoaring Art, instantly putting a great distance between them. Yan Long’zi’s palm missed and caused the stage to tremble violently under the impact.

“Supreme Dominance!” Not giving Yan Long’zi a chance to respond, Lin Yun brandished his sword and unleashed a boundless domineering aura.

“Flame Dragon Destruction!” Yan Long’zi’s face became sinister. He was confident in his physique, so he charged forward like a mighty dragon.

But right at this moment, a colossal azure dragon appeared behind him with a brilliant sword ray bursting out from its eyes. When the sword ray enveloped Yan Long’zi, his aura collapsed.

Lin Yun’s attack left a sinister wound on Yan Long’zi’s body that gushed out blood. After losing his flame intent, there was no way he could compete with Lin Yun who had combined the sword and dragon together.

He wanted to exchange injuries with Lin Yun by relying on his powerful physique, but it was a shame that he couldn’t even touch the corner of Lin Yun’s clothes. Looking at Yan Long’zi’s gushing blood, the crowd murmured in disbelief. Lin Yun broke Yan Long’zi’s physique.

“You…” Yan Long’zi suddenly collapsed to the ground. Out of confusion, he looked at the wound on his chest. With shock in his eyes, he looked up at Lin Yun. However, when he raised his head, his pupils narrowed as a sword ray expanded in front of him. Before he could even react, the Flower Burial Sword pierced through his chest.
