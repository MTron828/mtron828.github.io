Chapter 2070: Mountain River Order

Gu Zijing wasn’t willing to say much, but he had this responsibility as a member of the Sword Alliance. He said, “Ye Qingtian’s Astral Sword Intent might have reached greater mastery. This means that he has either grasped the sun or moon sword star and his sword intent could manifest into galaxies.”

“Pfft!” Zhao Wuji laughed when he heard that. He mocked, “Astral Sword Intent at greater mastery? Brother Gu, are you joking with me? You might as well say that he’s Flower Burial.”

Gu Zijing’s face sank when he heard that because Zhao Wuji’s words offended him.

“Brother Gu, you’re too serious about this. Ye Qingtian might be strong, but I don’t think he’s that unfathomable,” Feng Shaoyu said.

Gu Zijing placed the cup on the table and said, “I have already said what I must. I’ll say farewell since we can’t agree on the same topic. I wish you good luck three days from now.”

After Gu Zijing was done, he cupped his fists together and left.

“Hmph, coward. Isn’t it just a single defeat? As a member of the Sword Alliance, he’s speaking for the enemy instead,” Zhao Wuji said in disdain.

Jiang Yunting smiled and said nothing. He had already noticed that Gu Zijing admired Ye Qingtian and felt that Feng Shaoyu had broken the rules by being unethical.

“Brother Gu is the disciple of the Ice Emperor, so it makes sense for him to be aloof. Brother Zhao, you don’t have to take it to heart,” Feng Shaoyu said.

“So what if he’s the Ice Emperor’s disciple? He was still defeated,” Zhao Wuji argued.

“It’s getting late. I have some matters to attend to, so I’ll take my leave first,” Jiang Yunting was bored with this gathering and felt that there was no point in staying here any longer.

Feng Shaoyu got Feng Shengling to send Jiang Yunting off. When Feng Shaoyu and Zhao Wuji were the only ones left, their smiles disappeared.

“Stars from the thirty-six layers of heaven…” Feng Shaoyu sighed.

“Young Manor Master, are you still thinking about what Gu Zijing said?” Zhao Wuji asked. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Gu Zijing never makes a decision so easily. Since he said it, it must be true,” Feng Shaoyu said as he looked into the distance.

“How is that possible?” Zhao Wuji asked in surprise.

“Regardless of the possibility, he will lose three days from now,” Feng Shaoyu said. “No one can take the Cauldron Sword from the Hidden Sword Manor!”

While Feng Shaoyu was entertaining Zhao Wuji, two people were talking ten thousand meters below Hidden Sword Manor. This was a forging chamber with a blazing sacred flame. Above the sacred flame was a massive cauldron with molten iron boiling within.

There was a middle-aged man examining the sword fragments in front of him. The fragments came from the Heavenly Dipper Sword that was snapped today. This person was the Hidden Sword Manor’s Manor Master, Feng Wuji.

Opposite him was a beautiful woman indolently drinking wine and had a mark on her forehead. She was Lin Yun’s mysterious second senior sister, “Feng Yu.”

“No clues yet?” Feng Yu asked with a charming, gloating smile.

The middle-aged man shook his head and said, “I can’t see anything. I can’t figure out?how?someone at the Nirvana Stage could snap the Heavenly Dipper Sword. This is too unbelievable.”

Feng Yu mocked, “Didn’t you say it wasn’t tempered by earth fire?”

“That’s a lie. This sword has long been forged,” Feng Wuji was blunt about it. He looked at Feng Yu and sighed, “Third Younger Sister, you came from the Eastern Seas just to watch the Feng Clan's embarrassment?”

Feng Yu snorted and gulped down a mouthful of wine. She turned away and said, “Who asked you not to let me borrow the Cauldron Sword? There wouldn’t be so much trouble if you had let me borrow it.”

“You’ll give it to the Radiant Sword Saint if I give it to you. You know the old man has some grudges against him, and he’ll kill me if I give you the Cauldron Sword,” Feng Wuji smiled bitterly.

“You miser,” Feng Yu snorted unhappily. She suddenly smiled and asked, “Does the old man know that the Heavenly Dipper Sword has snapped?”

“You think I dare tell him about this?” Feng Wuji asked.

“Hehe, you have to tell him about it. He keeps boasting himself as the best blacksmith in the world. He was now insulted by a young man,” Feng Yu smiled.

Feng Wuji was furious as he threw the fragments out. He said, “Third Younger Sister, stop messing around. This is between the Hidden Sword Manor and Heavenly Dao Sect. If that brat takes the Cauldron Sword away, you won’t be able to borrow it anymore!”

Don’t be so sure about that. He’s my junior brother!?Feng Yu inwardly chuckled as she said, “Didn’t I already give you an idea? I’ll seal my cultivation and let Ye Qingtian have an arm. He definitely won’t be able to beat me.”

Feng Wuji couldn’t help laughing when he heard that.

Feng Yu frowned as she asked, “What’s the matter? Do I look very old? I can even claim to be seventeen, and I’m also a younger generation of the Feng Clan. So I can also be the sword wielder.”

Feng Wuji couldn’t hide his laughter and could only agree with his younger sister.

“Father… Aunt…” Feng Shaoyu came in and was briefly stunned when he saw Feng Yu before he greeted.

“You have something?” Feng Wuji asked.

Feng Shaoyu nodded, but he didn’t say it directly.

Feng Yu knew what this meant and smiled, “You, father and son talk. An outsider like me won’t get involved.”

“Aunt, goodbye,” Feng Shaoyu said.

“Shaoyu, your father was no longer your aunt’s opponent ten years ago. So it’s better to talk to your aunt than your father,” Feng Yu smiled.

Feng Shaoyu was tempted when he heard that because he had heard many rumors about this aunt.

“Leave quickly,” Feng Wuji waved his hand with a headache. If he let Feng Yu teach Feng Shaoyu, the odds of winning might decrease.

“Shaoyu, remember to find time to talk with your aunt. Your aunt loves you,” Feng Yu smiled before she left.

After Feng Yu left, Feng Shaoyu went down to business. He said, “Gu Zijing said Ye Qingtian’s Astral Sword Intent should’ve reached greater mastery.”

But Feng Wuji wasn’t bothered and asked, “So what? Yu’er, how much strength do you think is needed to snap this sword?”

Feng Shaoyu briefly pondered and said, “At least Saint Realm, but it wouldn’t be easy. You’ll even hurt yourself if you’re not careful.”

“So, how did he manage to break it?” Feng Wuji asked.

“I can’t figure it out,” Feng Shaoyu said bluntly. He tried figuring it out for a long time but didn’t have an answer.

“I can’t figure it out, either. The Heavenly Dipper Sword isn’t an ordinary Twospirit Glory Saint Artifact,” Feng Wuji said. As he spoke, he threw the fragments into the cauldron, wanting to reforge the Heavenly Dipper Sword.

Feng Shaoyu didn’t dare to speak beside Feng Wuji. A long time later, he said, “Gu Zijing also said that Ye Qingtian might have grasped the profundity of the Divine Firefly Sword.”

But Feng Wuji still had no changes on his face. He asked, “So what?”

Feng Shaoyu was anxious when he heard that, but he didn’t dare to refute it.

A long time later, Feng Wuji finally said, “You go stay in the Mountain River Order for a year. I have already given instructions for it.”

Feng Shaoyu squinted when he heard that. The Mountain River Order was a secret artifact of the Hidden Sword Manor that could affect time. But the resources needed were great, and Feng Shaoyu had already gone there once. According to the ancestral rules, he couldn’t go in again.

“It’s unnecessary because I’m still confident in this battle,” Feng Shaoyu said.

“Having confidence is good, but not many things can be done with only confidence. Go and see your grandfather. But remember?not?to tell him about the broken sword,” Feng Wuji said. He continued, “The Golden Era will arrive, and we had no choice but to lend out the Firmament Sword. We must keep the Cauldron Sword in the Hidden Sword Manor, no matter what!”

“Yes!” Feng Shaoyu said and cupped his fists together before leaving. When he returned to the ground, Feng Shaoyu didn’t hesitate to head towards the Feng Clan’s secret ground.

On a pavilion, Feng Yu stood on the roof as she looked at Feng Shaoyu’s back. She sighed, “I knew you’d go this far. Junior brother’s life is really bitter.”

She knew better than anyone that her brother was cold, despite his gentlemanly appearance. He rarely showed emotions to anyone besides his relatives, and nothing could change his mind once he decided. The moment he had determined someone as an opponent, he wouldn’t go easy on them, even if it was a junior.

“It looks like I’ll have to meet someone I should meet.” Feng Yu made up her mind and flew towards the Mountain River Order.
