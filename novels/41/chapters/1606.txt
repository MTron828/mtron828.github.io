Chapter 1607 - Buddha Statue

The ground beneath the golden Buddha was covered in blood and corpses. Only Lin Yun the one who remained. All the Myriad Beast Gate’s disciples had died without exception, including those who had ulterior motives by approaching him earlier.

That attack shocked everyone, and they now realized that it wasn’t a lie that they had just brushed past death.

“The name of that sword is Flower Burial?”

“He’s like a fiendgod, taking lives the moment he draws his sword. If he had drawn his sword earlier, Lu Chen might have been unable to withstand ten moves.”

“Don’t be so sure about that. After all, Lu Chen was already at his wit's end when Lin Yun drew his sword.”

“The moment Flower Burial is unsheathed, who can compete with him?”

“Let’s go. With Flower Burial here, no one can obtain the Golden Lotus. Aside from the chief disciples of powerful sects, anyone who goes there will die!” Sighs echoed from the surroundings as they left. Nothing good or bad existed in the Ancient Barren Battlefield since everyone came here with a desire. If they didn’t compete, they wouldn’t be able to stand out.

After all, who wouldn’t want the Golden Lotus? But they knew that they wouldn’t have any chances. They initially wanted to try it, but they dispelled that thought after Lin Yun drew the Flower Burial Sword twice. They were intimidated by that sword, and they were also terrified by Lin Yun’s decisiveness. The ten people who went up were all killed before they could even say another word.

Knowing that they couldn’t do anything to Lin Yun, they would not need to stay any longer since it would only be a waste of time. Very quickly, this place became empty, with Lin Yun being left behind. After Lin Yun closed his eyes, the Golden Lotus finally landed on the palm of that Buddha. It was a thousand meters away from him.

As a dazzling golden light gushed out from the Golden Lotus, it was accompanied by a boundless fragrance that had condensed into a golden liquid that was seeping from the petals. A colossal palm descended on the golden spiritual lake.

Sitting by the lakeside, Lin Yun drew out the Flower Burial Sword, and the sword began to devour the aroma that the Golden Lotus was giving off.

“What dense spiritual energy. No wonder it’s a priceless treasure of the Buddhism path.” Lin Yun’s eyes blazed with flames as he took out a seed from his interspatial pouch, the Bodhi Seed. He won this from Xiahou Yan’s younger brother during the Sword Sect’s test. It contained an origin saint rune within it.

If he completely refined it, aside from increasing his comprehension, it could even subdue the demon in his heart and be used to defend against various evil tricks. Furthermore, this also made him immune to poison. He couldn’t find an opportunity in the past, but this was an excellent opportunity.

After making up his mind, Lin Yun shut his eyes while holding onto the Bodhi Seed and began circulating the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon and Divine Firmament Sword Sutra.

He refined the Bodhi Seed with the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra and refined the Golden Lotus with the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon, killing two birds with one stone. When he refined them, he could hear a Buddhist chant within his ears, and the light he was giving off suddenly became pure and majestic.

The Buddhist light from the Bodhi Seed and Golden Lotus flowed into his body, and the Buddhist light from the Bodhi Seed formed into various runes that entered his profound palace. As the runes intertwined, they developed into a saint rune, the origin saint rune from the Bodhi Seed.

The Golden Lotus also possessed an origin saint rune and the spiritual energy contained within it converged. The saint rune then flew towards the Golden Crow Wings that sprouted behind him. Meanwhile, the Flower Burial Sword quietly absorbed the fragrance, and the aroma constantly reforged the sword.

Simultaneously, in a serene valley located deep in the Ancient Barren Battlefield, there was a saint elixir in bloom and a majestic phenomenon was blooming in the sky in the form of aurora lights. This place wasn’t only a treasured land, but also gave birth to a highly precious treasure.

Yan Kong, tasked with pursuing the Sword Sect’s disciples, was cultivating before the saint elixir, and his cultivation had reached a terrifying height with signs of making a breakthrough. He was also at the fourth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, but the aura he gave off was much stronger than Lu Chen's. The former was like an ocean, while the latter couldn’t even be considered a lake.

Multiple figures streaked across the horizon and appeared before Yan Kong. Some of them were the Profound Sky Sect's disciples, but most were the big sects' disciples and were respectfully standing before Yan Kong. When Yan Kong opened his eyes, a cold light flashed within his pupils, “How did it go?”

“Reporting back to Senior Brother, the Sword Sect’s disciples have more or less gathered, and we can make a move anytime!”

“Oh?” Yan Kong’s interest was piqued with excitement on his face. He naturally didn’t dare to treat the task given to him by Qin Tian lightly, but it was too slow to kill them one by one. It was more efficient to wait for them to gather before killing them.

“What about Lin Yun? Any news about him?” Yan Kong asked.

“Nothing about him. It’s like he suddenly disappeared. Maybe he died somewhere.” A disciple replied.

Lin Yun had just made an appearance that same day, so there wasn’t enough time for the news of his appearance to spread.

But Yan Kong denied, “That’s impossible. That fellow’s luck isn’t that terrible, not to mention that he won’t die so easily since he’s the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple.”

“That means he hid somewhere, then.” A disciple said.

Nodding his head, Yan Kong replied, “There’s a possibility, but he’s cautious, and he won’t reveal himself if he’s not strong enough. But that doesn’t matter because I don’t believe he’ll still continue to hide when all the Sword Sect’s disciples are dead! Summon the other sects’ disciples together!”

“Roger that!” A disciple replied and swiftly left this valley.

Half a day later, the Golden Lotus had already withered, and the Bodhi Seed in Lin Yun’s palm was also gone. The runes in his profound palace had condensed into a saint rune, emitting a holy and peaceful aura. When the saint runes intertwined, they formed a seven-layered pagoda, emitting a domineering aura. This meant that the Bodhi Seed had been entirely refined and was condensed into a pagoda in his sea of consciousness.

“Sovereign Pagoda, invulnerable to all evil.” The six words appeared in Lin Yun’s mind. The Bodhi Seed contained a Pagoda Saint Rune, emitting an ancient aura and profound Buddhist mantra.

When Lin Yun opened his eyes, his pupils shone brightly, making him look like an Arhat. Simultaneously, a powerful aura surged within his body, and the dragon origin ocean grew from a hundred thousand feet to a hundred and thirty thousand feet. His cultivation had also increased smoothly from lesser to greater second-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm.

He initially thought the Golden Lotus could push his cultivation to the pinnacle, but it only stopped at greater. Licking his lips, Lin Yun still wasn’t satisfied. But it didn’t matter because he had already obtained enough harvest, and he felt that his comprehension had reached an unprecedented height. His photogenic comprehension took another step further with the help of the Bodhi Seed.

Right then, the Flower Burial Sword began to tremble in mid-air. The sword was basked in tens of thousands of petals, and every petal gave off a blazing golden light that looked like flames. When he opened his eyes through the Flower Burial Sword, Lin Yun could see himself, and he turned into a streak flying over as the Flower Burial Sword summoned him.

When Lin Yun held onto the FLower Burial Sword, he was enveloped in the golden flames. Countless petals then converged to form a golden flaming dragon that poured into the Flower Burial Sword. The Flower Burial Sword gradually became heavy in Lin Yun’s hand, and the patterns on the sword glowed like flames.

As the Flower Burial Sword trembled, a faint Buddhist aura was being emitted from it. Lin Yun sheathed his sword before summoning the Golden Crow Wings. When the Golden Crow Wings unfolded, all the feathers began to blaze.

The origin saint rune in the Golden Lotus was a fire-attributed saint rune. After it was engraved on the Golden Crow Wings, it bestowed the Golden Crow Wings the fire attribute. When he flapped the wings, everything within his sight was instantly covered in flames, and the black clouds in the sky dissipated.

The power of the flames shocked Lin Yun because he had previously used his Heavenly Dome Sword Intent to disperse the black clouds in the sky, but now he could do the same thing with fire alone.

He wasn’t sure if the sacred flames were too powerful or the Golden Lotus’ Buddhist trait was what curbed the demonic clouds. The fire blazed for an hour before it finally calmed down. Aside from the Buddha statue, everything within his sight became wrecked under the flames.

Just when Lin Yun fell into deep thought, the Buddha statue’s palm that he was standing on began to tremble, and waves of Buddhist aura swept out from the statue, distorting the surrounding space.

“I must leave!” Lin Yun’s face changed. Flapping the Golden Crow Wings behind him, he soared to the sky like a sun. When Lin Yun hovered in the sky, he was shocked to see the Buddha statue flipping over its hand, and that space instantly became distorted. If Lin Yun was a step slower, he might have been suppressed in that space.Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

When the Buddha statue’s palm fell to the ground, the ground cracked with countless rocks hovering in the sky. As that region continued to collapse, the floor caved in, and this made Lin Yun’s face change. He realized that this wasn’t a statue, but an expert on the Buddhist path who became a saint by relying on his physique alone.

When Lin Yun felt uncertain, the Buddha statue moved again and a golden light radiated from its palm, descending towards Lin Yun. The surrounding space stopped, and Lin Yun couldn’t circulate his dragon origin or vitality. It was as though everything had been sealed under that Buddhist aura.

This made Lin Yun’s scalp go numb because this was the aura of a saint. He felt his bones were about to collapse under that palm, which made his face ugly. But in the critical moment, the Pagoda Saint Rune in his profound palace emitted a feeble light.
