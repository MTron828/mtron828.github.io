Chapter 1798 - Beautiful Night

Ji Lingfeng immediately ratted the Wind Edge Lord out, and everyone in the top ten immediately wore a playful expression. They were looking forward to seeing how the Wind Edge Lord would end up.

After all, the Wind Edge Lord was pretty confident earlier. But now, the Dragon Pulse Ranking revealed that Lin Xiao was Lin Xiao, not Flower Burial Lin Yun.

Even an idiot could tell that Flower Burial wouldn’t appear so publicly in such a high-profile manner. There were many rumors about him, some say he was dead, some claimed to have seen him, and some said he was crippled. Then again, there was a huge possibility that he was hidden in Skysolute City.

If anyone in the Kunlun Realm could protect him, it would be Sword Emperor Yu Qingfeng. This was because no one dared to go after the Sword Emperor.

Lin Yun raised his brow and looked at the Wind Edge Lord. This person was starting to get on his nerves. Even if it was bullshitting, it might still give him some trouble.

The Wind Edge Lord was startled at first when Lin Yun saw him, but he quickly calmed down. He cupped his hands together with a smile, “Congratulations, Brother Lin, on becoming first on the Dragon Pulse Ranking. I just had a slip of the tongue, and I hope Brother Lin doesn’t mind it.

“It’s hard for others not to connect Brother Lin with Flower Burial, and I believe you can understand me.” The Wind Edge Lord was narrow-minded, but he wasn’t stupid. So he quickly smiled after calming down.

But he was disgusting, making Xiao Yuanqi and Ji Lingfeng lightly furrow their brows with disgust filling their pupils. This sort of person was difficult to deal with because he was shameless.

“It’s fine.” Lin Yun smiled.

Heaving out a sigh of relief, the Wind Edge Lord smiled, “I knew Brother Lin won’t hold it against me, not to mention the Dragon Pulse Ranking already proved that you’re not Flower Burial.”

“But I do.” Lin Yun said, looking at the Wind Edge Lord.

The Wind Edge Lord’s smile froze, with Ji Lignfeng and Xiao Yuanqi briefly stunned before being unable to stop smiling. Lin Yun didn’t go along with what the Wind Edge Lord said, and slapped his face too quickly to be seen. The Wind Edge Lord was probably dumbfounded.

As the Wind Edge Lord spat out a mouthful of blood, he clutched his chest and went down on one knee before he was sent flying away.

The Blue Frost Lord and Snow Master Lord quickly came over to help the Wind Edge Lord to his feet. When he looked at Lin Yun, his pupils were filled with fear and everything happened too quickly. They didn’t even see how Lin Yun made his move.

When they sensed a dragon origin fluctuation, the Wind Edge Lord was sent flying away. Lin Yun now had a grandmaster’s demeanor.

“Lin Xiao has undergone a transformation?”

“It feels unfathomable and somewhat similar to Jian Jingtian. But the difference is too obvious. Jian Jingtian’s dragon pulses were close to a hundred thousand feet, and he had nourished his dragon pulses for eighteen years.”

“What exactly did he go through?” The faces of Ji Lingfeng, Xiao Yuanqi, and the Autumn Mountain Lord changed. They were all feeling great pressure right now, since Lin Yun had become stronger.

If they fought with Lin Yun again, he would probably have an easier time defeating them.

“I might just laugh it off if it came from others. But it’s a whole new story when coming from you.” Lin Yun coldly looked at the Wind Edge Lord.

This made the Wind Edge Lord feel horrified, fearful, and aggrieved. No matter how he racked his mind, he could never expect that the Lin Xiao he couldn’t be bothered to bat another eye at would become so strong.

He was filled with hatred, furiously clenching his right fist. But he didn’t even dare to look at Lin Yun. He could only clench his teeth and hope to take revenge in the future after reaching the Samsara Edict Realm.

The Autumn Mountain Lord quickly stepped forth to appease this matter, “Brother Lin, let me apologize on the Wind Edge Lord’s behalf. No matter what, this Martial Dao Tea Party has ended perfectly, and I owe you one.”

If Lin Yun didn’t stand out earlier, he would have to take responsibility as the host.

Although he didn’t manage to obtain first on the Dragon Pulse Ranking, the influence of the Martial Dao Tea Party would spread along with Lin Xiao’s fame. The Autumn Mountain Lord was naturally willing to see the influence of the Martial Dao Tea Party increase.

“You’re being too polite.” Lin Yun nodded.

“I was a little impulsive earlier, and I apologize for that. I had no idea that Brother Lin would face your tribulation anytime.” The Autumn Mountain Lord explained.

But Lin Yun shook his head and said, “You’ve done nothing wrong, and what you said is right. I can’t leave since the wind hasn’t stopped.”

The Autumn Mountain Lord was briefly stunned upon hearing what Lin Yun said, and he smiled, “If possible, I hope Brother Lin can be the host of the next Martial Dao Tea Party.”

“That’s a good idea! At that time, my Divine Phoenix Mountain will surely attend.” Ji Lingfeng said.

Xiao Yunqi also smiled, and said, “If Brother Lin is willing to be the host, the Heavenly Dao Sect will also participate.”

The other holy lands echoed along because they knew Lin Yun’s fame would spread throughout the Eastern Desolation. Compared to his title as Nirvana Banquet’s champion, being the first on the Dragon Pulse Ranking had a higher influence. But since the two titles overlapped on a single person, it was no different from being a legend.

Lin Yun smiled when he heard that. These people probably wouldn’t say it that way if they knew his true identity. He wanted to refuse, but he soon figured that he could let the Sword Sect hold this if there was an opportunity in the future; it could increase the Sword Sect’s influence, and the Sword Sect’s disciples would receive a lot of benefits. Thus, he replied, “I don’t mind, if it’s possible.”

“That’s a promise, then! Brother Lin, you can come and look for me anytime if you’re interested. I’ll be taking my leave for now!” The Autumn Mountain Lord cupped his hands together and nodded.

After everyone left, Ji Lingfeng smiled, “That fellow really knows how to gold plate himself. If Brother Lin wants to host the Martial Dao Tea Party at that time, all you need to do is say the word.”

His words were arrogant, but it was also the truth. Because of him, the Martial Dao Tea Party’s influence would expand, and Lin Yun’s current influence wasn’t at all inferior to the Four Young Masters added together, especially amongst swordsmen. As long as Lin Yun gave the word, a multitude of swordsmen would show up.

But Lin Yun merely smiled and cupped his hands before leaving. Those people might be ferocious on the stage, but they knew well that the Martial Dao Tea Party was only a spar and not a battle with their lives on the line. So they wouldn’t hold any grudges, even if they lost. Even if they fought ferociously on the stage, they would laugh it off down the stage.

When Lin Yun finished chatting with the three swordsmen, he left with Yue Weiwei. Before leaving, he took another glance at the Sword Sect’s party from afar.

Anyone could foresee that not long from now, Lin Xiao’s name would spread throughout the Eastern Desolation like wildfire.

“Big Brother Lin, you’re now first on the Dragon Pulse Ranking, not to mention you’re also first on the Nirvana Banquet. How do you feel?” Yue Weiwei asked with a smile.

Yue Weiwei was happy to see Lin Yun becoming first on the Dragon Pulse Ranking and even smoothly making it through his tribulation.

“It’s just a name, and fortune is invisible. But I did obtain a lot from this battle. If I didn’t fight and didn’t feel the pressure from Ji Lingfeng, Xiao Yuanqi, and Autumn Mountain Lord, I might not have been able to make it through my tribulation so smoothly.” Lin Yun replied.

The battle with those three made Lin Yun feel great pressure, and this also gave him a rough gauge of his current strength. Before that, he only knew he was strong and didn’t have a gauge of it. Many times, he needed a gauge of his strength, and it was more important than defeating many people at once.

Three days later, when the nightscape descended, Lin Yun and Yue Weiwei stood on a rock on the sea. They both knew that it would be time for them to part when they returned to Heavenly Domain City.

They didn’t know when they could meet again after this parting. So they took their time on the way back.

Lin Yun had to go to the Black Tortoise Void Sea, and he had to find a way to meet the Sword Sect’s party before that. He couldn’t disturb them, but he had to meet Zhao Yan. Zhao Yan was relatively introverted and was good at keeping secrets, so he wasn’t as eye-catching as someone like Ye Ziling. He had to give the five remaining sword forms of the Carefree 9 Swords to him.

If possible, he also wanted to inquire about his master and sect master. After that, it was time for him to go to the Heavenly Dao Sect. His senior brother was there and a Sword Saint. After all, he still needed someone to guide him in the sword dao.

Without the Radiant Sword Saint, he would have to stay in the Heavenly Dao Sect for a long time, and this meant it was unavoidable for him to part with Yue Weiwei.

As waves crashed against the rock under the moonlight, Lin Yun and Yue Weiwei gave each other a hug. This was a beautiful scenery, and they both whispered to each other and couldn’t maintain their composure.

When night came, Lin Yun took out the Thunderstorm Zither while Yue Weiwei received the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute. They both began to play Courting Phoenix on the sea.

Yue Weiwei blew the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute and looked at Lin Yun under the moonlight with gentleness in her pupils. It was great if time could stop now so that she could be together with her Big Brother Lin, carefreely staying together.

After he was done with the song, Yue Weiwei lowered the flute and smiled, “Big Brother Lin, am I beautiful?”

“You are.” Lin Yun said, raising his head.Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Then, you’re not allowed to look at other women in the future!” Yue Weiwei squinted her eyes, and her eyes were curved into two crescent moons.

“This…” Lin Yun was instantly placed in a difficult position.

“Hmph, and you still say I’m beautiful? You must be lying!” Yue Weiwei pursued.

“I…” Lin Yun quickly tried to explain. He wasn’t even flustered when he faced Ji Lingfeng, Xiao Yuanqi, and the Autumn Mountain Lord. But facing Yue Weiwei, he was placed in a tough spot.

When Yue Weiwei saw this, she laughed and leaned against Lin Yun’s chest. She said, “Hehe, I’m just kidding. Big Brother Lin, you only have to nod your head at times like this, and I’ll be happy, even if it’s a lie.”

Yue Weiwei had a soft body as she laid on Lin Yun’s chest, and her fragrance naturally latched onto him. This was a bizarre feeling, and it made him want to hug her. He would feel a great sense of satisfaction just by hugging her. It felt as though they had merged into one, and everything was great.

Lowering his head to look at Yue Weiwei, Lin Yun was fascinated by her for a moment and couldn’t help lowering his head.

Yue Weiwei’s face blushed, and she closed her eyes. When Lin Yun kissed Yue Weiwei, they both embraced each other under the moonlight. There was a flame blazing within their bodies, and they both wanted to melt into each other at this moment.

In the next moment, a crimson radiance that looked like a crimson flame illuminated the night sky. A carriage descended from the sky, pulled by two beasts that looked like two white stallions stopping before them.

When Lin Yun and Yue Weiwei’s lips parted, they were baffled when they saw the carriage. This was a Phoenix Carriage, an ancient and valuable Glory Saint Artifact. This carriage was even more powerful than the two God Generals’ Nerthermoon Saint Armor.

This carriage was engraved with phoenix runes, looking so noble and prestigious that no one could see what was inside the carriage. The carriage emitted a faint brilliance, causing a faint ripple to spread around in the surrounding space.

Evidently, this was also a spatial treasure, and there was a world inside. But what shocked them more were the two white beasts. They were pure-blooded saint beasts, and they shared a resemblance with the ancient divine beast, Bai Ze.

Lin Yun and Yue Weiwei exchanged a glance. They could both guess who was in the carriage. It should probably be an important figure of the Divine Phoenix Mountain.

The night was beautiful, and anyone would be unhappy to be disrupted. But Lin Yun could roughly guess the identity of this person, since this was what they were looking forward to. So they didn’t dare to be careless.

“I’m the Nirvana Banquet’s Champion, wonder which senior from the Divine Phoenix Mountain is it?” Lin Yun asked with his hands cupped together.
