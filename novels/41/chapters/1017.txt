Chapter 1018 - Divine Moon Breaking Seal

Half a day later, a figure descended from the sky. He had a robust figure and wore clothes made from beast hide. His skin emitted a metallic luster with wild nature flashing in his pupils. This young man was one of Nether Divinity War Realms’ generals, Beast King Nie Xuan.

On his shoulder stood a black ape with a third eye on its forehead. It was the descendant of the legendary Three-Eyed Demon Monkey. When Nie Xuan looked at the scene before him, his face was terrifyingly dark because all the demonic apes were dead. His heart hurt to look at this scene because he had to pay thousands of Divine Astral Pellets to control an overlord demonic beast.

“A mere ant from a lower realm dares to be so arrogant?!” Nie Xuan grit his teeth as cold light flashed in his eyes. A terrifying killing aura emitted from him that could make others tremble in fear.

The Yellow Sandy Plain was in chaos right now since news of Lin Yun defeating the Profound Lightning Dual Swords spread. It caused the Realm Sons to seal off the Yellow Sandy Plain. In the end, no one could leave this region anymore.

Meanwhile, all sorts of shocking news came out about Lin Yun. He had completely fallen out with three war realms and killed many people in his wake. This meant that leaders of numerous higher realms were killed by Lin Yun along with some geniuses from the war realms.

Every single time there was news about Lin Yun, it would cause a huge uproar. Everyone could tell that the war realms were paying a high price to kill Lin Yun.

“It’s not surprising since Lin Yun obtained an Azure Dragon True Bone.”

“A true bone? Whoa… Isn’t that opportunity a little too fortunate?”

“It’s definitely a huge fortune…”

“No wonder the Realm Sons are tempted by it.”

“I’m afraid Lin Yun won’t be able to get out in one piece.” No one was optimistic about Lin Yun.

Two days later, Lin Yun and Pei Xue arrived in the Demonic Wolf Clan’s territory. They stayed in a desolate and vast ancient battlefield. Aside from the occasional demonic wolves, there weren’t any other lifeforms around. When Lin Yun and Pei Xue finally found a demonic wolf, they sucked in a cold breath. The demonic wolves were massive. They looked like giant mountains when they laid on the ground. When they ran, they would even create large sandstorms that followed close behind.

Not long later, they were surrounded by the demonic wolves. The demonic wolves were intelligent, especially the chief, so they surrounded Lin Yun because they could sense the threatening aura coming from himm. Just like that, both parties fell into a stalemate as no one dared to make a move first. But just when both sides were starting to get annoyed, Lil’ Red jumped down from Lin Yun’s shoulder and walked towards the chief of the Yellow Sandy Plain Demonic Wolves.

“What is it trying to do?” Pei Xue asked in a concerned tone. She was naturally afraid that Lil’ Red would provoke the demonic wolves and that their battle would signal the three war realms.

“I’m guessing Lil’ Red is trying to negotiate,” replied Lin Yun. Lil’ Red might seem goofy most of the time, but it was still a reliable companion.

Lil’ Red spat out several interspatial pouches and retrieved the items in there for the chief to pick from. This made the chief frown and nod occasionally before picking several treasures and beast cores. Half an hour later, Lil’ Red returned and led Lin Yun into the territory of the Demonic Wolf Clan safely.

“The Lunar Soul Herb!” Lin Yun was surprised because he could sense the powerful moonlight essence contained in the Lunar Soul Herb. There were several old wolves guarding the Lunar Soul Herbs who looked at Lin Yun with caution. But under the instruction of the chief, they permitted Lin Yun and Pei Xue to approach the Lunar Soul Herbs.

“So many Lunar Soul Herbs!” Pei Xue’s voice trembled at the sheer number of the herbs. There were at least 300 herbs in plain sight.

“You want them? Lil’ Red said that we can pick fifteen, so I can give you five,” said Lin Yun.

“You want to refine that many of them? Don’t be impulsive. The Lunarsoul Herbs are poisonous and you can only refine three at most within a period of time. Any more and you’ll explode to death,” said Pei Xue with her face changed.

“Three?” Lin Yun pondered briefly before he replied, “That depends. The risk is worthwhile as long as I can achieve the complete Divine Moon Breaking Seal.”

Then, Lin Yun plucked three Lunar Soul Herbs and started chewing them without any hesitation. When he ate the Lunar Soul Herbs, he could instantly feel that his body was going to burst apart as light radiated from his blood. Then, the silver moonlight in his pores turned into mist.

Like Pei Xue said, the Lunar Soul Herbs were indeed poisonous. When Lin Yun ate three of them, he could sense the overbearing medicinal effect charging through his body violently. He forcibly suppressed the medicinal effect before he started to form the Divine Moon Breaking Seal.

A bright and ancient moon rose behind him as countless phenomena started to take form. When Lin Yun sensed it, he realized there were more phenomena this time around. However, most of them were blurry and he couldn’t comprehend them.

“This isn't enough.” Lin Yun waved his hand and tossed several more Lunar Soul Herbs into his mouth. It didn’t take long for Lin Yun to consume his tenth herb as light started to peer out of the cracks in his skin.

“It’s too domineering…” Lin Yun’s face became distorted as he circulated the Azure Dragon Saint Armor to protect himself.

“This is the limit, you can’t continue.” Pei Xue started to become anxious beside him.

“Relax, I haven’t reached my limit yet. I can sense that I’m going to succeed soon.” Lin Yun gnashed his teeth and continued to consume the Lunar Soul Herbs. In the blink of an eye, he swallowed over thirty of them.

Seeing Lin Yun’s actions, the elderly wolves couldn’t hold back anymore. This made Lil’ Red feel heartache as it continued to take out more treasures for the chief. When Lil’ Red opened a Dragon Clan Wine, the spirituality and fragrance instantly attracted all the wolves’ attention.

Meanwhile, Lin Yun’s body had turned red as he was enveloped in boundless moonlight. At this moment, his skeleton was on the verge of breaking.

“Soon! Soon!” Lin Yun continued to endure as he observed the various phenomena in the depth of his soul. He wanted to see what was at the depths of the moon that was comparable to the Golden Crow. When the number of Lunarsoul Herb he ate reached one hundred, more blood flowed from the cracks in his skin. But fortunately, the Azure Dragon True Bone emitted strands of the divine rune’s radiance to suppress the herb’s toxicity.

“You have to stop now!” Pei Xue started to regret telling Lin Yun about the Lunar Soul Herb.

“Don’t worry,” replied Lin Yun. He didn’t say too much because of the pain. Not long later, his body began to crumble because he had consumed too many Lunar Soul Herbs. The toxicity had reached a level that the Azure Dragon True Bone could no longer suppress. His body was on the verge of collapse while the wolves gathered around him in shock.

They could see a bright moon hovering behind Lin Yun that overshadowed the moon in the sky. Right at this moment, Lin Yun coughed up blood as his bones cracked. His current condition was terrible because he was on the verge of becoming a cripple.

Right at this moment, Lin Yun let out a roar as the Demonic Astral Flowers in his aura oceans began to blaze. Their radiance enveloped him to suppress the toxicity of the Lunar Soul Herbs. Right at this moment, Lin Yun was enveloped in a sacred light that made him look mysterious.

“Extraordinary!” Pei Xue bit her lips when she looked at this scene. This was a genuine, peerless, and extraordinary talent. As long as he could rise, he would surely stir up a storm of blood to shine brightly even in the Kunlun Realm.

Aside from activating the Demonic Astral Pellets, Lin Yun even circulated both his sword sutras as the Azure Firmament Tree appeared with Iris Flowers on its branches. Just like that, Lin Yun managed to stabilize his physique from collapsing. But even so, Lin Yun was still covered in blood and could lose his life any moment. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

But he still managed to bear it for three days as he stood like a powerful sword beneath the moonlight. Looking at this scene, Pei Xue’s mouth was wide open because Lin Yun had been consuming Lunar Soul Herbs for the past three days. The total number that he consumed had reached 200. “Holy…”

“Success!” Lin Yun suddenly opened his eyes while the bright moon behind him shattered into pieces. Shortly after, moonlight bloomed while a moon condensed within Lin Yun’s palm. In the depths of the moon was a silver phoenix that emitted an ancient and noble aura.

It was the divine bird comparable to the Golden Crow, the Silver Phoenix. When Lin Yun slowly got up on his feet, blood flowed throughout his body. At the same time, his wounds were slowly healing since the Lunar Soul Herb’s toxicity was gradually forced out of his body.

“Divine Moon Breaking Seal, the perfect Divine Moon Breaking Seal!” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with excitement when he saw this scene because this meant that he could start cultivating the holy spirit martial technique, the Divine Solar Lunar Fist. This also meant that he could also convert it into the Divine Solar Lunar Sword.

At this moment, there was no way Lin Yun couldn’t reach the end of the Heavenly Path with the Azure Dragon True Bone, Sky Sword Intent, and the Divine Solar Lunar Sword as his trump cards.
