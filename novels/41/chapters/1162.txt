Chapter 1163 - Impudent?

The opening of the Spirit Astral Mountain was a grand occasion in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, even grander than the Sword Saint Mountain. After all, most disciples could have an attempt in the Sword Saint Mountain since it could be opened every half a year.

But it would take at least a decade for the Spirit Astral Mountain to be opened. So compared to the Sword Saint Mountain, the threshold of the Spirit Astral Mountain was definitely higher. Only those in the Empyrean Realm were qualified, and it would depend on one’s luck to see how much they could benefit from it. So all the disciples had already set off for the Spirit Astral Mountain before dawn.

As for Lin Yun, he wasn’t in a hurry. He had been facing Lil’ Red for the past three days relying purely on his physique, which allowed his Azure Dragon Saint Physique to improve greatly. Then again, it was naturally tough for him as well.

Behind his residence was a spiritual lake, and Lin Yun was washing in the lake together with Lil’ Purple and Lil’ Red. It felt great when the spiritual energy entered his body through his pores, sweeping away his exhaustion from the past three days. Just like that, Lin Yun leaned against a rock with a towel covering his face as he allowed the Azure Dragon Saint Art to circulate naturally.

He could sense the immense vitality surging within his body, making him feel like a dragon basking in the sun. Meanwhile, Lil’ Purple was humming while she enjoyed soaking in the spiritual lake. She had also gotten a lot of good stuff when she went out of the sect with Lil’ Red. As for Lil’ Red, it simply played in the lake in its cat form.

When Lin Yun recovered from his exhaustion, he removed the towel from his face and his aura had reached an unprecedented height. At this moment, he looked like an azure dragon himself as he looked at the rising sun. He was hoping that everything would be smooth today.

He was determined to give everyone he knew a shock when they met again, and he was also determined to chase after Su Ziyao. After all, he had already given his promise back in the Great Qin Empire, and he wouldn’t let anyone else touch his woman.

“What a pervert.” Lil’ Purple snorted.

But when Lin Yun lowered himself to see Lil’ Purple covered in the mist, he couldn’t help laughing, “Lil’ Purple, why are you covering yourself with a mist?”

“Hmph. How can I allow mortals to look at the divine body of this empress?” Lil’ Purple said with her nose pointed at the sky and her eyes filled with disdain.

“Hahaha!” Lin Yun couldn’t help laughing. “You brat, what is there to see? You have neither chest nor butt. Ye Ziling at least still has a pair of long legs, but you have nothing.” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“ARGGGGGHHHHHHHH!” Lil’ Purple screamed with her face turning red while she swung her arms at Lin Yun, “This empress will kill you! You scumbag, bastard, pervert!”

“You’re exposed,” smiled Lin Yun. When he was done, he put on his clothes and returned to the shore. Seeing that Lil’ Purple was still furious, he smiled, “Alright, let’s stop playing. Come out quickly because we still have to rush towards the Spirit Astral Mountain.”

“No! You have to tie my braids!” Lil’ Purple said with her cheeks puffed up.

Looking at Lil’ Purple, Lin Yun could only shake his head helplessly. Ever since he braided her hair once, she had been requesting him to braid her hair.

“Alright,” smiled Lin Yun. Lil’ Purple was no longer mad as Lin Yun agreed to her request. Just like that, Lil’ Red held the mirror while Lin Yun tied Lil’ Purple’s braids. Lin Yun was a lot more proficient in tying the braids compared to the past.

“What’s the meaning of your braids? You seem to be pretty obsessed with them…” Lin Yun smiled because he noticed that Lil’ Purple was a little obsessed with her braids. When Ye Ziling put ‘makeup’ on her, Lil’ Purple only cared about her braids.

“Hmph, I'm not going to tell a scumbag, bastard, and a pervert like you,” replied Lil’ Purple.

Lin Yun wasn’t offended by those names and continued to comb her hair with a smile. Lin Yun was concerned about the Spirit Astral Mountain even though he didn’t look anxious.

“Do you know anything about the Spirit Astral Mountain?” Lin Yun asked because he knew nothing about it.

“Of course. The Spirit Astral Mountains were born in ancient times, and they’re unlike any of the treasured lands you’ve seen before. There are nine heavens in the sky, and each heaven has four layers. Beyond the 36 layers is the starry sky with countless stars. There are also the four constellations, shining their light on Kunlun,” explained Lil’ Purple.

“I know that. They’re the Azure Dragon, Vermillion Bird, White Tiger, and Black Tortoise,” said Lin Yun. He already knew about that back in the Heavenly Path because the Heavenly Path was divided in the same manner. The four constellations were also separated into seven star groups that are represented by metal, wood, water, fire, earth, sun, and moon.

Furthermore, each star group had countless stars. So no one knew how big the four constellations actually were. Aside from the four constellations, there are also many other constellations. Some were extremely hidden, and some were even bigger than the four constellations.

Lin Yun simply couldn’t imagine how terrifying the golden age was that someone set up arrays based on the four constellations. Furthermore, he didn’t know if it was a coincidence that the Empyrean Stage was named Star, Galaxy, and Astral Stages. Then again, those were unrelated and Lin Yun was more concerned about what kind of place the Spirit Astral Mountain was.

“Alright.” Lin Yun was finally done with the braids, which satisfied Lil’ Purple.

“You’ll know about it later. It doesn’t really matter because the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect can only break through two layers at best,” said Lil’ Purple.

This made Lin Yun wonder if the sky really had 36 layers. When he raised his head, he began to think about Lil’ Purple’s title. Could it be that she had really slaughtered the sky back then? If it was real, then she would be a little too terrifying. He couldn’t imagine it was the same little girl who was obsessed with her braids in front of the mirror.

“You want to go and take a look?” Lin Yun asked.

“It’s no big deal. The Sword Saint Mountain is more interesting, so I’m not going.” Lil’ Purple said. “Don’t die in there. Nothing is certain when it comes to the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm. Even in ancient times, there were many geniuses who died trying to reach that level.”

Lin Yun’s lips twitched when he heard that because it sounded as though Lil’ Purple was cursing him. Just like that, Lin Yun headed down the mountain and reached the gathering point. There were a lot of people here, but those who could stand on the surface of the lake were all core disciples in the Empyrean Realm.

When Lin Yun swept his glance out, everyone was more or less gathered, including the elders. Ye Ziling, Wang Yuruo, Feng Zhang, and the rest were naturally here as well, including the ‘chief disciple’ that he fooled three days ago. But what left Lin Yun shocked was that Luo Hua was also here.

“Senior Sister, Senior Brother Yun is here!” Wang Yuruo yelled when she saw Lin Yun’s arrival. If there weren’t so many people here, she would have pounced on Lin Yun by now.

On the other hand, Ye Ziling still looked angry and replied, “Taking his own time when everyone is already here.”

“Hehe. Senior Brother Yun definitely had something more important that made him late,” said Wang Yuruo. But when Lin Yun heard that, he couldn’t help blushing because he was only braiding Lil’ Purple’s hair.

Lin Yun’s arrival instantly attracted everyone’s attention. After all, Lin Yun had become a well-known figure after saving Ye Ziling, so he naturally became the center of attention.

“Senior Brother, Lin Yun is here.” A person spoke out beside Jiang Lichen.

“I know,” replied Jiang Lichen with his face darkened. He wasn’t a fool, and he had long noticed Lin Yun. They were dressed in a similar way, but Lin Yun’s temperament was a lot stronger than his, which made him jealous. Plus, Lin Yun was close to Ye Ziling and the others.

Although Ye Ziling didn’t talk to Lin Yun, Jiang Lichen knew that it would be impossible to get her to react if they weren’t close.

“Looks like Senior Sister’s attitude towards him has changed after the incident on the Heavenly Aquatic Island,” said another disciple.

“I’ll let him know why I’m the chief disciple of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect when the Spirit Astral Mountain is open!” Jiang Lichen didn’t show any emotions on the surface, but he was raging with fire in his heart for Lin Yun's 'impudence'.
