Chapter 1835 - It's Fate That We Met

As the Flower Burial Sword trembled in mid-air, it was knocked back and Lin Yun gently held onto it. He said, “You’d already be a dead person if I was at the Profound Life Stage.”

“But you’re not, right?” The Fire God General smiled.

“Fire God General, it has come to an end here. We’re not invisible, but you won’t be able to take Lin Xiao’s life with us around!” Xiao Yuanqi and Ji Lingfeng flashed to the side and appeared before Lin Yun. They could sense that the Fire God General wasn’t playing around, and he was trying to use Lin Yun to intimidate everyone.

He might be wearing a smile, but her pupils were filled with murderous intent. This made the Fire God General briefly stunned before he smiled, “How dare two flies who have just reached the Profound Life Stage speak to me in this manner. I’m… at the seventh stage Profound Life Stage!”

When the Fire God General unleashed his full cultivation, he didn’t hold back and the armor he wore began to glow.

This instantly made Xiao Yuanqi and Ji Lingfeng’s pupils squint because they recognized the armor. It was the Glory Saint Artifact, the Nethermoon Saint Armor. Before they could even respond, they were sent flying by the Fire God General with a punch before they were caught by two elders.

“How is this possible?!” Ji Lingfeng and Xiao Yuanqi were shocked. The Fire God General might have reached the Profound Life Stage long ago, but they never expected that his cultivation would be so terrifying.

This scene made everyone’s hearts jolt, and even those at the seventh Profound Life Stage were intimidated by the aura the Fire God General was giving off. Under the empowerment of the Nethermoon Saint Armor, the Fire God General was practically invincible, and no one could stop him.

Right then, a small gap appeared in the door and a figure swiftly slipped through it. This person was Yu Wenxiu. His attention was on the bronze gate the entire time. So he immediately took his chance while everyone’s attention was attracted by Lin Yun and the Fire God General.

Many more demonic cultivators also charged towards the Black Thunder Saint Palace. But before they could get close, they were killed by the Fire God General. The latter was too powerful after he fully unleashed his cultivation. His hair fluttered violently in the wind, and he emitted a powerful aura.

Those demonic cultivators were instantly killed without having their corpses left behind, and this instantly made everyone in the surroundings become quiet. Everyone was intimidated by the Fire God General, and they couldn’t help gulping down a mouthful of saliva.

“Who dares to move?” The Fire God General said coldly. “Don’t mind me saying this upfront. If I don’t obtain the Black Thunder Saint Canon, don’t blame me for starting a massacre, and all of you will die!”

When he finished, he waved his hand and wanted to kill Lin Yun before entering the Black Thunder Saint Palace, just like how he killed the demonic cultivators earlier.

But before his attack could land on Lin Yun, it was stopped by a totem. Gu Jun wielded the Black Tortoise Totem, and he looked at the Fire God General, “Young man, you’re too arrogant.”

The Fire God General furrowed his brows while looking at Gu Jun and the Black Tortoise Totem in his hand, and he gradually became excited.

“Big Brother, there’s something weird about Yu Wenxiu. He won’t ruin it for us, will he?”

“It’s fine if he’s after the Black Thunder Saint Canon, but…” Ao Feng and Yan Cangming transmitted their voices over, as though the three of them weren’t here for the Black Thunder Saint Canon.

“I’ll keep you around for a little longer.” The Fire God General glanced at Lin Yun before entering the Black Thunder Saint Palace with Ao Feng and Yan Cangming.

This instantly made everyone else feel relieved, and they quickly entered the Black Thunder Saint Palace. Even if they didn’t compete for the Black Thunder Saint Canon, there would still be other treasures around.

Ji Lingfeng and Xiao Yuanqi were injured. But after swallowing a pellet, they bade their farewells to Lin Yun in a hurry before rushing into the Black Thunder Saint Palace. They would naturally not be so easily intimidated by the Fire God General, and they naturally had to compete for the Black Thunder Saint Canon. It didn’t take long for the surroundings to be empty.

“Are we still going into the Black Thunder Saint Palace?” Mei Zihua asked as he looked at Lin Yun.

An Liuyan didn’t say anything, but her gaze fell on Gu Jun. She asked, “Senior Gu, what do you think?”

The Fire God General was strong, and this naturally made Mei Zihua and An Liuyan cautious. After all, he was at the Seventh stage Profound Life Stage and had the Nethermoon Saint Armor, not to mention he had two helpers. So they naturally had to be cautious because not even all the holy land geniuses added together could suppress him.

“Let’s not enter. It’s too dangerous inside. Just give me the tortoiseshell. Anyways, it makes no difference if I obtain the Black Thunder Saint Canon instead of you guys.” Gu Jun said cautiously.

“Well, that works.” Lin Yun took out the tortoiseshell and handed it over.

Gu Jun was briefly stunned because he didn’t expect Lin Yun to be so straightforward. When he received it, he still couldn’t believe it.

“Brat, what tricks are you playing?” Gu Jun asked in a hesitant voice.

“I don’t need the Black Thunder Saint Canon. Just let me take a glance if you obtain it. Then again, you have to return the tortoiseshell to me because this was given to me by my senior brother, and it has a special meaning for me.” Lin Yun said.

He didn’t need the Black Thunder Saint Canon but wanted to walk his own path. So he had to absorb the strengths of other martial techniques. The Fire God General gave him great pressure, and the latter was only at the pinnacle of the Profound Life Stage. If that was the case, how strong would the strongest genius of the various holy lands be?

Lin Yun recalled the woman from the Divine Phoenix Mountain who rode the carriage and used the Phoenix Heart Song to break through her bottleneck. He had to quickly head to the Heavenly Dao Sect and find his senior brother. He couldn’t afford any more delays.

As for the Black Thunder Saint Palace, Gu Jun was a descendant of the Black Tortoise Clan. So he naturally had a higher chance of obtaining the Black Thunder Saint Canon than everyone else.

Since Gu Jun helped him block an attack from the Fire God General, Lin Yun decided to trust him once.

As Gu Jun’s facial expression became serious, he said, “You guys can just immediately leave the Black Tortoise Void Sea and head to the Profound Spirit Island. Members of the Sacred Alliance is there, and no one dares to do anything in their territory.”

Right then, a figure descended from the sky. It was a black-clothed man with a bamboo hat on. This person briefly looked at Lin Yun and was surprised. When he saw Kou Tianhua’s headless corpse, his footsteps paused, and he turned around, “You’re actually not dead?”

“I already said that I won’t die even if you do.” Lin Yun nearly forgot about this person, but he never expected that this person would be so late after the Black Thunder Saint Palace opened up.

“You and that old friend of mine are sharing more similarities. He’s also tough to kill.” The man in black said in an eerie voice.

“Your as well.” Lin Yun said with a playful smile. He had roughly guessed the identity of this person. If this person was really who he thinks he was, this person would be really tough to kill.

After all, everyone who was defeated by him, they were either dead, devastated, or shaken behind by him. But this person wasn’t dead, and he seemed to have received some sort of opportunity.

Mei Zihua and An Liuyan could sense the tension between them, and they both became nervous. But right then, a peal of crisp laughter resounded, and the woman whom Lin Yun met back on the Black Tortoise Ship appeared, “Haha. What a coincidence that everyone’s here.”

The moment Gu Jun saw this person, his face became pale. This woman was as beautiful as before, like a fairy who came out of a painting.Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

This made Lin Yun lock his brows and wonder if this woman had been together with the man in black. After all, it was too much of a coincidence for them to appear together, and the man in black also turned to look at the woman in puzzlement.

“The Black Tortoise Secret Key?” The woman’s gaze briefly stopped on the tortoiseshell before she smiled, “It’s a coincidence for us to meet. We came together on the Black Tortoise Ship and ran into each other at the Black Thunder Saint Palace again. Why don’t we head in together? Old beggar, lead the way.”

She waved her hand at Gu Jun with a smile plastered on her face.

This startled Gu Jun, and he quickly returned the tortoiseshell to Lin Yun. He awkwardly smiled, “This doesn’t belong to me, and I’m already getting on in age. I’ll not be going, then. It’s more suitable for youngsters like you to go.”

But just when he wanted to flee, the woman raised her brow and smiled, “Everyone from the Black Tortoise’s lineage are all talented. So why call yourself old? Come over here!”

She revealed a bewitching smile, and this made Gu Jun’s legs tremble. He didn’t dare to get close, nor did he dare to move.

This made Mei Zihua and An Liuyan curious. They couldn’t understand why Gu Jun would be so terrified of this woman.

But as Mei Zihua had a favorable impression of this woman, he smiled, “Brother Lin, why don’t we go in with this big sister? It’s fate that brought us together, and we won’t have to fear the Fire God General, even if we run into him.”

“You guys go. I’m not going anywhere.” Gu Jun shook his head.

“I didn’t say that I’m going together with you guys.” The man wearing a bamboo hat had no interest in this, and headed towards the Black Thunder Saint Palace alone.

“Haha. The Black Thunder Saint Palace isn’t simple, and there might be demonic corpses. Young lad, why don’t you reconsider?” The woman smiled, placing his hand on that man’s shoulder.

The man wearing a bamboo hat was surprised because when the woman’s hand fell onto his shoulder, he didn’t even realize it. But it was already too late when he wanted to dodge, and this immediately made him ponder about the origin of this woman.

Lin Yun furrowed his brows, and his heart sank. At this time, even a fool could tell that this woman wanted to force them inside together, so they had no right to refuse at all.

The faces of Mei Zihua and An Liuyan also changed, and they looked at the woman with a hint of fear within their pupils. This was a piece of bad news, and they couldn’t help turning to look at Lin Yun.

“Haha. Since it’s so lively here, count me in as well.” A burst of hearty laughter resounded, and the white-robed man who snatched Lin Yun’s saint origin earlier appeared. He was covered in a white cloth like before, and only his eyes were exposed.

In terms of dressing alone, this man was even weirder than the man wearing a bamboo hat. When this person appeared, the woman removed her hand and they both exchanged a gaze with a smile.
