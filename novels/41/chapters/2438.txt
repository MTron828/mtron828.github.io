Chapter 2439 - Annihilation God Hand

Li Wuyou and Mei Zihua were waiting nearby in the God Burial Mountain Range. Now that the seal had loosened up, Saints could enter without much risk. But this place was covered in a black demonic aura, corroding everything in its path. If anyone had a choice, no one would want to come here.

“Why hasn’t the Ninth Princess come out yet?” Li Wuyou asked in a worried tone. He might seem confident that Su Ziyao wouldn’t die in the God Burial Mountain Range with her strength and fortune, but that didn’t stop him from worrying.

“Mister Ghost, why don’t you go in and take a look?” Mei Zihua asked, looking at the hooded man. The hooded man’s name was Mister Ghost, and they promised a hefty reward for inviting him to help. This person was a demonic cultivator, and he was a Great Saint.

Mister Ghost replied, “The seal might’ve loosened up, but Great Saints still can’t enter. But judging from the seal, Great Saints will be able to enter within a year, and the Kunlun Realm will fall into chaos at that time.”

“I didn’t expect a demonic cultivator like you to be concerned about the Kunlun Realm,” Li Wuyou smiled.

“The Demonspirit Clan won’t care if you’re righteous or demonic,” Mister Ghost said eerily. “It had only been three thousand years since the Nine Emperors vanquished the darkness. Three thousand years ago, the Kunlun Realm was in chaos, aside from the holy lands, which barely held on, and the world was no different from a living hell.”

“You’re saying that as though you had witnessed it,” Mei Zihua muttered.

Mister Ghost merely smiled but said nothing.

Suddenly, a tremor came from the God Burial Mountain Range, and a crack expanded with a demonic aura gushing to the sky. This startled Mei Zihua and Li Wuyou before a golden beam shot out from the demonic aura.

“The Ninth Princess!” Li Wuyou and Mei Zihua’s eyes lit up. But before they could do anything, Su Ziyao had appeared before them. They quickly bowed, “We greet the Ninth Princess!”

Su Ziyao merely nodded before she raised her hand, unleashing crimson flames. When she turned back around and looked at the black-clothed man, a prestigious aura swept out from her, and she asked, “Who is he?”

Li Wuyou explained, “My Li Clan and the Mei Clan aren’t willing to help with the Radiant Sword Saint’s tribulation. We’re not strong enough, so we can only try and pay a great price to invite a Great Saint of the demonic path over.”

Mei Zihua added, “None of the righteous cultivators in the Divine Dragon Empire dares to come, and only Mister Ghost agreed amongst the demonic cultivators.”

“They would die if it wasn’t for righteousness. Who would dare to come if they didn’t receive help from the Radiant Sword Saint or were prepared to die? Since none of the righteous cultivators dared to come, no demonic cultivators would dare to come. Those who dare to come are naturally those with ulterior thoughts,” Su Ziyao snorted.

Li Wuyou and Mei Zihua’s faces changed before they turned to look at Mister Ghost with their hearts panicking.

Mister Ghost smiled, “The Nine Princess is right. None of the righteous cultivators dared to come, not to mention the demonic cultivators. The demonic cultivators might seem arrogant, but they’re all cowards, and none dared to go against the Empress. Someone asked me, so I came here with the preparation to die, and you can bring me along if you’re going to help.”

Li Wuyou was alarmed before he asked, “So you have a reason as to why you came over? After all, only you out of all the demonic cultivators dared to come.”

“I have so many treasures piled into a mountain based on what the two of you gave me,” Mister Ghost smiled.

“Bullshit. Do you think the ten thousand-year saint elixir is that easy to find?” Mei Zihua snorted.

“You can leave,” Su Ziyao said. A battle was ahead, and she would rather bring one lesser person than someone with an unclear identity.

Right then, groups of cultivators riding beasts that gave off a baleful aura began pouring over from the surroundings, with Drifting Goblet and Bai Lixuan leading the troops. They were stationed nearby with the Blood Word Battalion.

“There’s a situation in the God Burial Mountain Range. The two of you remain here with the Blood Word Battalion and watch over it,” Su Ziyao ordered.

“Roger that!” Drifting Goblet and Bai Lixuan said without hesitation and heaved sighs of relief when they saw Su Ziyao coming out.

While Su Ziyao was about to head to the Sword Sect, Mister Ghost said, “Ninth Princess, are you not going to bring me along? The Indigo Dragon Lord entrusted me to help. If I don’t go, the Indigo Dragon Lord would have suffered for nothing.”

Su Ziyao’s heart throbbed because the Indigo Dragon Lord was An Liuyan. Although Lin Yun said nothing, Su Ziyao knew about his relationship with An Liuyan. She asked, “How do I address you?”

“You can call me Mister Ghost.”

“Mister Ghost?”

“That’s right.”

“Let’s go, then,” replied Su Ziyao. With that, they rushed to the Sword Sect.

The Sword Sect’s situation worsened after the Light Subduing Great Saint brought out his trump card. Fortunately, Jian Jingtian held his ground and barely managed to stabilize the situation.

But Jian Jingtian couldn’t help the other main peaks due to the Heavenly Sever Great Saint's means, even if he held his ground. It didn’t take long after the Pellet Firmament Peak’s collapse before the Emerald Firmament Peak also collapsed.

Shortly after, the Azure Firmament Peak collapsed as well. Only the Scarlet, Golden, Indigo, and Divine Firmament Peaks remained intact. The situation on Indigo Firmament Peak was dangerous since six people were ganging up on the Dragon Origin Great Saint.

When the Light Subduing Great Saint unleashed his full strength, the Demon Clan’s Great Saint and Azure Python Great Saint couldn’t hold on any longer.

“Sun and Moon Unite!” The Light Subduing Great Saint executed a powerful move where the sun and moon formed into an ancient ‘Ming’ word that radiated with unimaginable power. The moment the word appeared, heavenly dao fluctuated before the crimson sword ray in the depths of the Sword Sect rippled.

The massive azure dragon suffered a heavy blow as the Light Subduing Great Saint charged with the Imperial Dragon Order, controlling the Golden-Purple Dragon. This dismissed the azure dragon’s transformation and he returned to his human form, crashing into the Scarlet Firmament Peak’s main palace and was covered in injuries.

Feng Yu quickly stepped forth to help, ensuring that Jian Jingtian wasn’t disturbed.

“That old fellow’s Yin-Yang Dao is too powerful,” the Azure Python Great Saint gritted his teeth.

“That Golden-Purple Dragon as well!” The Azure Python Great Saint was furious when he looked at the Golden-Purple Dragon in the sky, throwing out a mouthful of blood. He could still hold his ground after taking the first strike, but the second strike made him lose the ability to carry on fighting.

The Demon Clan’s Great Saint briefly fought before he summoned his main body, a Heavenly Moonhowl Wolf. This made Feng Yu look concerned since it was rare for her husband to summon his main body, which meant that he was in a perilous state.

Not far away, Jian Jingtian’s aura had also declined. The energy declined after the three peaks collapsed, and Jian Jingtian’s aura was lower than the Heavenly Sever Great Saint. He barely held on with the Bright Sun Sword Intent and Great Profound Sword Canon.

“There’s no need to hurry. I know that swordsmen are dangerous as long as they have a breath left. So let us play slowly.” The Heavenly Sever Great Saint said, seeing that the Heavenly Glory and Flame Crow Great Saints wanted to join in.

Jian Jingtian was furious and roared, “Heavenly Sever, are the Black Mountains so cowardly?!”

The Heavenly Sever Great Saint eerily smiled, “Swordsmen are proficient at fighting with their lives on the line, but there’s no need for me to put myself in danger because of you. Hahaha!”

“Damn it!” Jian Jingtian charged forth, tearing apart thousands of evil spirits. But when he charged out, there were a few more wounds on his body. When he wanted to turn around to tear apart the domain, the Heavenly Glory and Flame Crow Great Saints held him down.

As a result, Jian Jingtian could only watch as the Heavenly Sever Great Saint began clasping his hands together with a demonic aura surging and slowly fixing the domain. He had used his domain to manifest the eighteen layers of hell. As long as the domain didn’t fall apart, it would be impossible to hurt him.

“Hahaha! Radiant’s disciple, you’re still too tender!” The Heavenly Sever Great Saint laughed, taunting Jian Jingtian. But just as he laughed, he suddenly felt something wasn’t right with a hint of threat. When he wanted to look around, a bone hand enveloped in golden flames crashed against his domain.

The flaming bone hand contained massive power that left cracks in the domain, with all the evil spirits howling in pain from the flames. Just when the bone hand was about to grab onto the Heavenly Sever Great Saint, this terrified the latter into dodging.

When the bone hand clenched, a terrifying power swept out that tore the domain apart before the bone hand charged forth, landing a palm on the Heavenly Sever Great Saint, causing him to throw out a mouthful of blood and take a few steps back.

“Who is it? Do you dare to show yourself?!” The Heavenly Sever Great Saint roared with fear.

The golden bone hand shone brightly with saintly music and various pictures. This was the sign that a legend had arrived. It was Su Ziyao who had appeared, enveloped in a golden radiance with a flower crown on her head that made her look like an emperor.

Seeing the newcomer, the Heavenly Sever Great Saint exclaimed, “Su Ziyao!”

The three words seemed to contain significant intimidation, making the Heavenly Sever Great Saint’s heart tremble. Even the Heavenly Glory and Flame Crow Great Saints quickly stopped fighting with Jian Jingtian. They retreated to the Heavenly Sever Great Saint’s side, looking at Su Ziyao with a complicated gaze.

They all recognized this newcomer, the Empress’ successor, Su Ziyao, the only one amongst the younger generation who could rival Lin Yun. The rumors were true that Su Ziyao and Lin Yun were lovers. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have come to help the Radiant Sword Saint in his tribulation, since that was the same as falling out with the Empress.

As for Mister Ghost, who came with Su Ziyao, he joined the fight with the Light Subduing Great Saint, greatly lifting the pressure off the Demon Clan’s Great Saint.

Jian Jingtian had a complicated gaze and said, “Lady Luo Hua, you shouldn’t have come...” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

When she was in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, he was used to addressing Su Ziyao as Luo Hua, her moniker. After all, she was the Ninth Princess with a deep relationship with the Empress.

Su Ziyao replied, “Lin Yun and I have become husband and wife. His master is also my master, and no one can stop me from coming.”

Jian Jingtian was stumped and couldn’t say anything else. As for Feng Yu, Mu Xuankong, and the Azure Python Great Saint, they were stumped when they heard what she said.

“Hahaha! The Empress wanted the Ninth Princess to form a connection through marriage with the royal clan, but she married Lin Yun instead! Hahaha!” The Azure Python Great Saint couldn’t help laughing; anyone could hear his grudge against the Divine Dragon Empire.

After all, they couldn’t beat the Divine Dragon Empire or provoke them, so he had pent everything up. But after hearing what Su Ziyao said, even his injuries didn’t feel that painful anymore.

On the other hand, Feng Yu was happy for Lin Yun, and she smiled, “Even our junior brother is married. I believe that our master will be happy for him.”

On the other hand, the three opposing Great Saints felt aggrieved and couldn’t figure out why Lin Yun had so much charm. Not only did so many experts come from him, but he even married the Empress’ successor, which was unbelievable.
