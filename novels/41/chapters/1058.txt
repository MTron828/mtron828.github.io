Chapter 1059 - Forbidden Region

Many people were gathered in a plaza after chasing Lin Yun for seven days. Some had a grudge with Lin Yun, some were here on orders from the war realms, and others were hoping to take advantage of Lin Yun.

The three Realm Sons didn’t hesitate to charge through the gate, but the rest of the people were hesitating.

“The Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm…” The Imperial Diagram Realm Son locked his brows together with fear flashing through his pupils. It was a secret realm that was dissipating. No one was sure when the entrance would collapse, but they would have to wait at least another millennium for it to open.

Even if one had a great fortune from the secret realm, they would die after a millennium. Even if one was lucky enough to make it out of the secret realm after a millennium, the Heavenly Path would be closed.

The three Realm Sons were willing to risk their lives because they had a deep feud with Lin Yun. After all, Lin Yun massacred their forces and humiliated them in battle. In fact, he made the Nether Divinity Realm Son kneel and then slapped the latter.

The current rumors were exaggerating Lin Yun’s battle, but they weren’t that far from the truth. After all, Lin Yun demonstrated the power to fight the Realm Sons on his own.

Lin Yun completely humiliated the war realms, so he had to die. Otherwise, the three Realm Sons wouldn’t have the face to join the final battle. It was even worse for them because they used despicable means to fight Lin Yun and still lost. There was even suspicion towards the Realm Sons as Lin Yun suddenly became heavily injured.

Lin Yun had eight Demonic Astral Flowers in his aura ocean when he confronted the Nether Divinity Realm Son. So even if he was injured, it shouldn’t be a problem for him to head to Four Phase City.

But when he left Wind Mound City, his aura dropped all of a sudden. Some people speculated that someone acted in the dark to help the Nether Divinity Realm Son dark. Although they were baseless rumors, it was enough to put the Nether Divinity Realm Son under a microscope.

If the Nether Divinity Realm Son could kill Lin Yun, no one would care that he used despicable means. Naturally, he had to follow Lin Yun into the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm to accomplish this goal. However, no one else felt the pressure that the Nether Divinity Realm Son was feeling. Instead, they were able to stop themselves from entering the forbidden realm.

“There are many forbidden regions in the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm. He’s probably going into one of them. I bet he’s planning to die there so it won’t benefit the Nether Divinity Realm Son…” The Imperial Diagram Realm Son muttered his thoughts. His voice wasn’t loud, but it had caused a series of agreements.

By now, everyone knew that Lin Yun had many treasures aside from the Azure Dragon True Bone. In fact, his holy spirit martial technique was enough to tempt many people.

So there was no question that the three war realms would benefit a lot if they managed to capture Lin Yun. However, with Lin Yun’s pride, he was most likely headed for the forbidden region.

Pei Xue’s face changed drastically when she heard that because she didn’t think that about the forbidden region in the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm. So without any hesitation, she charged into the gate.

“Damn it!” The Imperial Diagram Realm Son gritted his teeth with cold light flashing through his pupils. Why couldn’t Lin Yun die peacefully? Why did Lin Yun have to cause him so much trouble? Although his eyes were flickering, he still flew into the flaming gate. After all, Pei Xue had a Divine Blood Fruit in her body and he had promised a powerful figure in Kunlun Realm that he would bring the fruit out.

So no matter what, he couldn’t let Pei Xue die. In that split moment, more people charged into the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm. Many people were ready to give up when the Imperial Diagram Realm Son was speaking. But after watching him charge through the gate, they thought that he was purposefully tricking them.

Lil’ Red was familiar with the forbidden realm, so it instantly took Lin Yun and Yue Weiwei to the forbidden region. The forbidden region was where Yu Haotian died, which proved how terrifying the forbidden region was.

This entire region was enveloped in mist with corpses all over the ground. No one could imagine what was in the forbidden region, but no one wanted to explore it.

“This place is dangerous and we might not be able to come back out if we go in,” said Yue Weiwei tactfully.

“Honestly, I don’t want you to enter with me,” replied Lin Yun.

“No!” Yue Weiwei quickly said with tears welling up in her eyes, “If we have to die, I want to die together with you. You can’t leave me behind.”

Taking a deep breath, Lin Yun said, “That’s why I didn’t leave you behind. If anyone else went in, they might die. But if it’s me, we might have a chance.”

He had some confidence as long as he didn’t venture into the depths of the forbidden region. After all, this was the same Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm that he obtained the strongest inheritance from. Technically speaking, the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm was his home ground. No one could compete with him in terms of luck in this place. If the Azure Dragon palace was around, then he might be under the protection of the spirit in the palace.

“I trust you, Big Brother Yun. I believe that we won’t die here.” Yue Weiwei smiled with her pupils shining brightly.

“Let’s go!” Without any hesitation, the three of them entered the forbidden region. There were incessant howls in the mist but Lin Yun wasn’t affected by them because of his firm determination. However, he also started to wonder if he was about to die. After all, Yu Haotian was also forced into this forbidden region back then.

Faintly, he could sense the existence of karma. However, that thought was instantly destroyed by Lin Yun’s heart as a swordsman. As a swordsman, he didn’t believe in karma. The only thing that he believed in was the sword in his hand.

An hour later, the Realm Sons stopped outside the forbidden region. The three Realm Sons wore ugly expressions because Lin Yun was determined to not give them any benefits. But if the Nether Divinity Realm Son couldn’t kill Lin Yun personally, the slap to the face would always be a thorn in his heart.

“They actually entered the forbidden region!”

“The Imperial Diagram Realm Son was right. Lin Yun really forced himself into a dead end.”

“What a pity.” Many people had sadness on their faces because they were looking forward to watching Lin Yun in the final battle. They were sad that they wouldn’t get to see him compete with the war realms.

“Arghhhhh!” At this moment, a series of screams sounded out from the forbidden region. The followers of the Realm Sons were forced into the forbidden region to chase after Lin Yun. Unfortunately for them, they were instantly destroyed.

A few people managed to run out of the mist, but they swiftly withered and turned into dried corpses. Many people were forced to reevaluate their deisre to obey.

“This forbidden region devours vitality…” The Profound Dragon Realm Son’s face was pale after he examined a few corpses. “The entire forbidden region will devour the vitality of anyone who steps into it.”

His conclusion made many people feel chills. Just what kind of forbidden region was this terrifying? Suddenly, the entire Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm began to tremble while cracks appeared in the air.

“The entrance is about to collapse. Quick, we have to leave!” The collapse of the entrance made many people nervous. They didn’t want to stay any longer than necessary. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Let’s go!” The Imperial Diagram Realm Son forcibly suppressed Pei Xue and quickly left the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm.

As the cracks became even more terrifying, the Nether Divinity Realm Son’s face turned dark. It took a while before he spoke, “Let’s go. Completely destroy the entrance when we get out. I want to make sure he can’t make it out!”
