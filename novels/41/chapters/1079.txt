Chapter 1080 - Defeating the Imperial Feather Realm Son, Digging Out The Flame Dragon's Heart

As Lin Yun radiated with sword ray, the entire sky began to tremble. He had unleashed a terrifying aura that made him look like an immortal.

“Sky sword intent at complete mastery?!”

“How the hell did he manage that?”

“Isn’t he only in the fifth soul Heavenly Soul Realm? J-just how did Lin Yun manage to do that?!” It was publicly known that it was hard to grasp the sky sword intent before the Empyrean Realm. But Lin Yun had brought his sky sword intent to complete mastery. The aura he emitted was so strong that everyone felt like they were insignificant insects. At this moment, Lin Yun was the king of swords, filled with prestige and pressure.

“He’s a monster. His talent is simply monstrous!” The elders from the various sects were watching everything unfold with crazed eyes. Even the Imperial Feather Realm Son was shocked. He initially thought that he would be able to suppress Lin Yun with the Flame Dragon’s Heart, but he never expected that Lin Yun had another trump card.

“So what if your sky sword intent is at complete mastery? You still have to kneel before me!” The Imperial Feather Realm Son’s expression was cold. Golden flames blazed on the surface of his body as he pushed his martial intent to the limit.

He then formed seals and pushed his hands forward, unleashing a dragon roar with boundless dragon breath toward Lin Yun. Facing the sea of flames, Lin Yun’s wings flashed as he pushed his speed to the limit.

Lin Yun’s afterimages were destroyed from the series of explosions, leaving his main body behind. When the crowd spotted Lin Yun’s main body, they saw a boundless sword aura that resonated with heaven and earth.

The Imperial Feather Realm Son’s face was cold as the Flame Dragon’s Heart radiated, which turned his eyes gold. Then, with a seal blooming in his palm, he released a terrifying aura comparable to the Empyrean Realm. With this punch, a dragon roar echoed out that caused space to collapse.

It was only a phenomenon, so space wasn’t actually collapsing. However, it was realistic enough to make Lin Yun feel pressured. Furthermore, the Imperial Feather Realm Son seemed to have used a secret technique that allowed his strength to far exceed his current cultivation.

“Imperial Dragon Seal!” The elders in the starry sky instantly recognized this move because it was famous in Kunlun Realm. It was the secret technique of the dragon clan that was widely spread, but only those with the dragon bloodline could cultivate it. So it was unbelievable to them that the Imperial Feather Realm Son could cultivate this secret technique by relying on a dragon’s heart.

When the Imperial Feather Realm Son unleashed the Imperial Dragon Seal, everyone could sense the surrounding space collapse. Simultaneously, countless flames converged into a tornado that charged at Lin Yun.

But Lin Yun was unbothered as he summoned the Azure Firmament Tree with Iris Flowers. With the phenomenon created by the combination of two sword sutras, the flames were destroyed before they could even reach Lin Yun.

“What a powerful attack!” Everyone marveled how Lin Yun unleashed the full power of his sky sword intent at complete mastery.

But the Imperial Feather Realm Son was confident that everything would go according to plan. After all, Lin Yun’s flaw was pretty obvious. Charging forward, the Imperial Dragon Seal bloomed in his palm once again.

This time, the Imperial Feather Realm Son became gigantic. Instantly, he portrayed the image of an immortal emperor descending upon the mortal plane.

With his new attack, the Imperial Feather Realm Son made cracks appear on Lin Yun’s sky sword intent. Clearly, Lin Yun’s cultivation wasn’t strong enough to fully unleash the sky sword intent at complete mastery. If his cultivation was higher, his sky sword intent wouldn’t be able to crack so easily.

The Imperial Feather Realm Son was evidently very strong. With his fully charged Imperial Dragon Seal, the Imperial Feather Realm Son was able to split Lin Yun’s sword intent. Once the attack got through Lin Yun’s defenses, it landed on his shoulder.

Blood dripped down Lin Yun’s lips as he was sent flying away. At this moment, killing intent gathered in the Imperial Feather Realm Son’s pupils as he glared at Lin Yun. Then, he poured more energy into his Imperial Diagram Seal.

The dragon’s heart throbbed once more, filling his body with vitality. Behind him, the flame dragon holy spirit suppressed both of Lin Yun’s holy spirits.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Taking advantage of this opportunity, the Imperial Feather Realm Son pushed out his palm. Lin Yun couldn’t resist the attack and the dragon runes that covered him were destroyed.

After losing the Azure Dragon True Bone, Lin Yun’s physical defense had greatly weakened. If he still had the bone, an attack of this caliber would only lightly injure him.

“Great!” The five realm sons rejoiced. Although they were unhappy with the Imperial Feather Realm Son becoming the champion, they knew that Lin Yun would target them if he won. So they naturally hoped for Lin Yun to die.

“He’s bullying Lin Yun based on the fact that Lin Yun doesn’t have a sword!” Someone suddenly noticed the issue with Lin Yun’s fight. Even if Lin Yun’s sword intent was strong, it was impossible for him to unleash his full prowess without a sword in his hand.

“Lin Yun, you can face your death now!” The Imperial Feather Realm Son looked at Lin Yun coldly. He was confident that he could kill Lin Yun with one or two more attacks. At that time, there was nothing Lin Yun could do even with his improved sword intent.

“Why do I feel that you’re courting death? Imperial Feather Realm Son, your dao armor should be more or less destroyed, right?” Lin Yun smiled. His words instantly made the Imperial Feather Realm Son think that something wasn’t right.

Although he managed to face Lin Yun with the Imperial Dragon Seal, he was also constantly attacked the moment he got close to Lin Yun’s sword aura. So his dao armor was on the verge of being destroyed because of Lin Yun’s sword intent.

“You must’ve also used up all your trump cards, right? You don’t have to deny it because you wouldn’t reveal the Flame Dragon’s Heart if you had other options. Did you really think that you could bully me just because I didn’t have a sword with me? Didn’t you consider the possibility that I could be doing this on purpose?” Lin Yun continued.

The Imperial Feather Realm Son’s face suddenly changed as he snorted, “So what? I just have to defeat you with another palm. In fact, two more palms will kill you!”

“You’re really overthinking it!” Lin Yun barked, “Imperial Feather Realm Son, let me be honest with you. It’s simple for me to kill you. The reason why I took such a troublesome route is because I’m not weak. I just wanted everyone to know how much I hate sneak attacks. So I’ll make you pay the price and get the interest back in the process!”

Lin Yun didn’t want to just defeat the Imperial Feather Realm Son. He wanted to kill the Imperial Feather Realm Son. Now that the Imperial Feather Realm Son had revealed all his trump cards, he could claim the latter’s life.

“You’re courting death!” The Imperial Feather Realm Son instantly figured out Lin Yun’s thoughts. Enraged, he unleashed the Imperial Dragon Seal once more.

“Hahaha!” Lin Yun laughed. “You Realm Sons have been looking down on me. You call me a demon because you hope to obtain a righteous position by killing me.Today, I’ll show you guys the true meaning of a demon!”

In the next second, Lin Yun’s bloodline began to boil as the Azure Firmament Sword Sutra began to circulate within his body in an unprecedented manner. Then, black demonic light appeared on Lin Yun’s body before manifesting into a sword aura that soared into the sky. The entire region had turned dark while Lin Yun’s laughter echoed in everyone’s ears.

Everyone could hear the arrogance, killing intent, and desolation in his laughter as the black demonic light manifested into a radiating black sword. As a violent aura emitted out of Lin Yun, he looked like a Demon Lord, especially with the mark on his forehead.

At this moment, he became a demon of heaven and earth. Lin Yun was finally unleashing the 14th form of the forbidden sword, the Azure Firmament Thirteen Swords—Crowning Demon.

Letting out a ferocious roar, Lin Yun’s eyes flashed brightly. His footsteps contained his boundless sword intent as he wielded his finger like a sword. Then, he pierced through the incoming Imperial Dragon Seal. At this moment, his sky sword intent was invincible.

When Lin Yun’s attack landed, his fingers tapped the Imperial Feather Realm Son’s chest. At this moment, torrential demonic light shot out as the Imperial Feather Realm Son’s dao armor shattered.

“NO! NO! NOOO!” The Imperial Feather Realm Son let out a roar filled with fear as he saw Lin Yun’s hand pull backwards. It looked just like when he dug out Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon True Bone. Lin Yun was repaying the favor and going for his Flame Dragon’s Heart.

Since the Flame Dragon’s Heart had a divine rune on it, Lin Yun was faced with great obstruction. However, he didn’t dare to give up. Instead, he revealed a sinister smile.

The Imperial Feather Realm Son’s divine rune was no longer at its strongest and the majority of the power had already been exhausted. So what could it do to Lin Yun right now? No matter how the Imperial Feather Realm Son cried out, his Flame Dragon’s Heart was getting extracted in front of everyone.

When Lin Yun was done, the blood of the Imperial Feather Realm Son splattered out of his chest. Now, the Flame Dragon’s Heart was in Lin Yun’s hand.
