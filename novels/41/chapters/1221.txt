Chapter 1222 - Empress

Prior to the Sword Assembly, the Feng Clan was really popular among swordsmen. After all, they would come asking for swords and to examine the Lightning Shadow Sword. Even Dragon Pulse Realm experts would pay the Feng Clan a visit because of the Lightning Shadow Sword.

But after the Sword Assembly, everything was in a mess. Not only was the plaza a mess, but the Feng Clan’s reputation had suffered a huge blow. So Luo Hua and Yan Tie managed to enter the manor easily without any guards discovering their existence.

“Over there,” said Luo Hua while she pointed at a palace located on a mountain.

“Not in the Hidden Sword Pavilion?” Yan Tie was surprised because he thought that such an expert would be in the Hidden Sword Pavilion. After all, the Hidden Sword Pavilion was built by the Hidden Sword Manor, and there were all sorts of spiritual runes that were part of arrays. It was probably the safest place in the entire Feng Clan’s residence.

Then again, this was also for the best because it would lessen their trouble. As the two of them traveled in the air, no one noticed them as they headed toward the palace.

It didn’t take long for them to descend on the palace. Before the two Elysium Core Realm elders guarding the palace could even respond, they were instantly knocked out by Yan Tie. If Yan Tie was doing things his way, he would have killed the guards. However, he only knocked them unconscious because Luo Hua had a specific target and didn’t want to affect others who weren’t involved. So Yan Tie had no choice but to rein himself in.

Luo Hua was wearing her normal white clothes and white veil that covered her face. As she walked forward, all the guards who discovered her would be knocked out cold by Yan Tie. When the two of them entered the palace, the white-haired elder of the Feng Clan had surprise on his face.

He was initially healing his injuries on a stone platform, but he opened his eyes when he sensed Luo Hua and Yan Tie’s arrival. He was briefly stunned before he instantly figured out the intent of Luo Hua and Yan Tie’s visit. With a smile, the white-haired elder mocked Luo Hua. “You have such a foul temper at such a young age. What’s the matter? You want me to apologize to a junior like you?”

He had violated Feng Xuanzi’s rules to make a move against Lin Yun, and he was also the one who sent the Elysium Core Realm expert to go after Lin Yun’s life. Based on what Lin Yun did at the Sword Assembly, Lin Yun would have been killed a thousand times over if it weren’t for Feng Xuanzi’s interference. He was probably the only person who could take this lying down. He initially didn’t place this matter in his heart, and he would’ve even forgotten about it if Luo Hua didn’t appear before him.

“Whose idea was it? Yours or Feng Xuanzi?” Luo Hua asked, ignoring the old man’s mockery.

“Feng Xuanzi? He can’t order me around. If he was willing, you and that little bastard would be dead before the two of you could even leave the Feng Clan. He’s a coward to be afraid of a lass like you, but I’m not!” The old man’s eyes flashed coldly.

“Old man, do you still have no idea of your situation?” Yan Tie grinned.

“My situation?” The old man squinted his eyes before he snickered, “You better worry about yours instead. I might be afraid of you outside the city, but you’re nothing here in the Feng Clan!”

When he was done, a sword rose into the air. It was a thousand-rune saint artifact. When he unsheathed the sword, 18 Elysium Core Realm experts walked out from the darkness wielding hundred rune saint artifacts. Although this old man wasn’t the patriarch, his seniority allowed him to possess a powerful force in the Feng Clan.

“Tell me about your objectives and beg me for mercy. Otherwise, you can die right now.” The old man barked at Luo Hua while holding onto his thousand-rune saint artifact.

Standing beside Luo Hua, Yan Tie began to feel nervous because he didn’t think that the old man would also have a thousand-rune saint artifact. Facing this formation, even Yan Tie would get injured if he tried to leave relying on brute force. Plus, he had to take care of Luo Hua, so an escape was looking impossible. But when he looked at Luo Hua, the latter was calm as if nothing could threaten her.

“I’m here to borrow something,” said Luo Hua as she walked forward.

“What is it?” The old man squinted his pupils with ridicule on his face. He didn’t know how Luo Hua could be so confident despite facing death.

“Your head!”

The old man was briefly stunned before he laughed.

“Is it funny?” Luo Hua said while she removed her veil, exposing her charming appearance.

“How is that not…” The old man sneered but a shocking pressure came from Luo Hua before he could finish speaking. It was like a seal had been broken as Luo Hua transformed into an empress with an immense aura that was befitting of a monarch.

When Luo Hua’s aura spread out, the surrounding Elysium Core Realm experts fell to their knees. Their faces distorted in pain as they knelt on the ground. The face of the old man also turned pale and as his knees fought the unimaginable pressure to remain standing.

Yan Tie, who was behind Luo Hua, was completely dumbfounded and couldn’t utter a single word. He wasn’t shocked by Luo Hua’s strength but the power sealed in her body. The power was something that he had never seen before, nor could he find anything comparable to it. The pressure also scared him as he wanted to kneel behind her.

Before the old man could resist, Luo Hua tossed the white veil over that emitted a dazzling white light. When everything settled down, Luo Hua put her veil back. Yan Tie managed to see a part of her face before she covered it up, and he could feel his heart throbbing violently from her beauty.

The veil had no blood, but the head of the Feng Clan’s elder was rolling on the ground. When Yan Tie felt a gaze directed at him, his heart trembled and he nearly fell to his knees. He quickly cupped his hands together, “This subordinate, greets Young Master Luo.”

“You’re not my subordinate nor is your surname Luo. So you don’t have to kneel before me.” Luo Hua said indifferently as she walked out of the palace. A long time later, her voice sounded out, “Hang the nine heads on the city wall and make sure it’s visible to anyone who passes by.”

“Alrighty. Don’t worry about anything. This is what I’m the best at!” Yan Luo grinned even though he was filled with lingering fear from what just happened. Could it really be a sin that deserved death if he really managed to see her true appearance?

Then again, he only caught a small glimpse of Luo Hua’s face. Instantly, Yan Tie wondered if Lin Yun had seen Luo Hua’s appearance. But the more he thought about it, the more obvious it became. In his mind, Lin Yun had to have seen Luo Hua’s face since she was willing to do all of this for him. After all, the nine victims were experts in the Dragon Pulse Realm.

He could even imagine how shocking it would be when he hung the nine heads on the city wall. For some reason, he had a feeling that Luo Hua didn’t place these people in her eyes and that Dragon Pulse Realm experts were nothing to her. She did this only to create a form of intimidation so that no one could rely on their cultivation to bully Lin Yun because she couldn’t reveal her unique identity. Upon realizing this, Yan Tie exclaimed at Lin Yun’s luck. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

He believed that he was a stud when he was young, but he never ran into such fortune. Various thoughts flashed across Yan Tie’s mind while he cleaned up the mess.

Meanwhile, Feng Xuanzi, Feng Xiaoyu, Feng Xingyang, and the Dragon Pulse Realm elder who was responsible for protecting Feng Xiaoyu were standing at the highest roof of the Hidden Sword Pavilion. It was also the safest place in the Feng Clan.

Even if a saint came, it would take some time to break through the defenses because the entire Hidden Sword Pavilion was a thousand-rune saint artifact, a saint pagoda. Feng Xiaoyu and Feng Xingyang were both nervous and didn’t even dare to breathe loudly.

They were brought here last night and Feng Xuanzi wouldn’t tell them what was going on no matter how they asked. But they could sense that it was a complicated matter, especially since they were brought here for protection.

Suddenly, Feng Xuanzi opened his eyes and looked out of the window. His actions immediately caught Feng Xiaoyu by surprise as she moved to the window and saw a white figure streaking across the horizon. It was naturally Luo Hua who had become her nightmare.

Behind Luo Hua was a demonic cultivator with a crimson blade on his shoulder while he held onto a decapitated head.

“Great granduncle!” Feng Xiaoyu’s face changed as she exclaimed.

The old man was Feng Xuanzi’s uncle who had the highest status in the Feng Clan. But the old man didn’t have a good relationship with Feng Xuanzi because Feng Xuanzi’s father won the patriarch position. It made everyone forget about the old man, especially after Feng Xuanzi became a heavenly spiritualist.

But his death still brought fear to the little princess of the Feng Clan. Even Feng Xingyang was trembling as he asked, “Great granduncle died just like that?”

“I warned him. There’s nothing I can do since he decided to court death. You don’t need to worry about it,” said Feng Xuanzi coldly.

“Who the hell is that woman?” Feng Xiaoyu exclaimed.

Looking at Feng Xiaoyu, Feng Xuanzi looked at her gently and said, “Xiaoyu, you’re the princess of the Feng Clan, but the world is bigger than you think. There are people that we can’t afford to offend, and I hope that you can become mature and realize this. After all, I can’t take care of you for your entire life.”

At this moment, Feng Xuanzi looked like an old man who had lost all ambition. Clearly, the Sword Assembly had taken a toll on him.

“I’m sorry, grandfather. I’ll behave myself in the future.” Feng Xiaoyu quickly came forward and comforted him. She felt bad for what she did because she just realized that she had brought huge trouble to the Feng Clan. If it wasn’t for her grandfather, the Feng Clan would be wiped out by now.

“It’s fine.” Feng Xuanzi smiled. No matter what his granddaughter did, she was irreplaceable in his heart.

“Now that it’s settled, you will go to the Hidden Sword Manor with Xingyang. You’re not young anymore, and it’s time for you to go out.” Feng Xuanzi had made arrangements for them and warned them not to get revenge. After all, the Feng Clan was at fault and they were lucky that Luo Hua only took the lives of those responsible.

A long time later, Feng Xingyang asked, “Who the hell is she? She can’t say it and neither can you ? Can it be that her origin is even bigger than the Hidden Sword Manor?”

“If she said her origin, then the Feng Clan would have to be eradicated. Since she didn’t say anything, I naturally can’t say anything either. Just stop asking questions.” Feng Xuanzi glared at Feng Xingyang.
