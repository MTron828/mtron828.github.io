Chapter 1404 - White Dragon After 300 Years

Everyone’s gaze became weird when they heard Lin Yun saying he had a good temper. They naturally wouldn’t take Lin Yun’s words for real, and they could tell what Lin Yun said was a threat. Think about the outcome of the seven saint clans’ princes. If Xiahou Yun went against his words, they could imagine that Xiahou Yun’s outcome would be worse than those princes.

“Xiahou Yun, don’t bet with him…” Bai Zhanli nervously whispered beside Xiahou Yun. He was initially confident in Xiahou Yun because of the Bodhi Seed. But when he saw Lin Yun’s smile, he suddenly lost his confidence.

But Xiahou Yun didn’t bother about Bai Zhanli and looked at Lin Yun, “Hmph. What if you lost?”

“It’s fine because I won’t lose,” replied Lin Yun.

Seeing how arrogant Lin Yun was, Xiahou Yun’s eyes flashed. “Simple. If you lose, you have to withdraw from joining the Sword Sect. It’s not easy to take my Bodhi Seed!”

An exclamation burst throughout the surroundings when everyone heard what Xiahou Yun said. It looked like Xiahou Yun came prepared. The Bodhi Seed was a treasure that could boost comprehension. As long as Xiahou Yun didn’t have terrible comprehension, Lin Yun might not be able to beat him with his comprehension further boosted by the Bodhi Seed.

Right then, Ye Ziling said, “Junior Brother Lin, this is too risky. Don’t bet with him.” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Lin Yun wouldn’t be able to join the Sword Sect if he lost, and this was too huge. Not only Lin Yun, even Ye Ziling couldn’t accept it.

“Lin Yun, don’t tell me that you’re chickening out after hearing my terms?” Xiahou Yun mocked with a smile. “It’s fine if you want to chicken out. You just have to admit that you’re inferior to Xiahou Yan.”

But Lin Yun raised his head and replied, “I’m afraid you’ll regret it.”

“What a joke!” Xiahou Yun coldly said. “How will my Xiahou Saint Clan regret anything we do? It’s just a Bodhi Seed and nothing to a saint clan. On the other hand, you only been in the Kunlun Realm for a year. So if you can’t join the Sword Sect, you’ll probably regret it so much that you’ll cry out loud.”

The corner of Bai Zhanli’s lips twitched because Xiahou Yun knew how to boast. The Bodhi Seed was a precious treasure, and it was given to Xiahou Yan by a Saint in the Xiahou Saint Clan. If he didn’t remember incorrectly, the entire Xiahou Saint Clan only had that one Bodhi Seed.

The Bodhi Seed was rare. Although the Bai Saint Clan also had treasures that could boost one’s comprehension, it was inferior to the Bodhi Seed. The Bodhi Seed could enhance one’s comprehension and subdue the heart demon, preventing the cultivator from going amok in cultivation. If one was strong enough, they could even refine the Bodhi Seed into the body and get many benefits from it.

“You first.” Lin Yun reached out, letting Xiahou Yun have the first go around.

Xiahou Yun smiled, “You first. Let me see how high you jump so that I can slap you down later. I bet you’ve never experienced that feeling before.”

Hearing what Xiahou Yun said, rage flashed in the eyes of the disciples from the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect because Xiahou Yun was really arrogant.

“Are you sure about that?” Lin Yun asked.

“Of course I am. Anyhow, you’ll be the one to lose!” Xiahou Yun confidently said. Since Lin Yun was arrogant, he would be even more arrogant than Lin Yun.

“I’m just afraid that you won’t even have the chance to perform,” said Lin Yun before he went up the stage.

“Xiahou Yun, you’re insane!” Bai Zhanli’s face was ugly, looking at Lin Yun’s silhouette. “The Bodhi Seed is a precious treasure. If you lose the bet, the Saint in your clan will surely come after you!”

“Do you think that I’ll lose?” Xiahou Yun smiled confidently. Before Bai Zhanli could reply, Xiahou Yun continued, “I won’t lose. He’s aiming for greater mastery, so he can only grasp five sword forms at most. Why don’t you guess how many sword forms I have grasped?”

“Ten?” Bai Zhanli replied in an uncertain tone.

“Twelve sword forms,” replied Xiahou Yun.

Bai Zhanli’s jaw dropped when he heard what Xiahou Yun said. It was simply too unbelievable, which meant that the Bodhi Seed’s effect was too terrifying. This meant that Xiahou Yun had practically grasped this high-grade sword technique in less than two days.

Xiahou Yun wore a satisfied expression while looking at Bai Zhanli’s face. He believed that Lin Yun would also show the same face not too long from now. He confidently smiled, “Let him jump. The higher he jumps, the harsher he’ll fall. I can already foresee that he can’t enter the Sword Sect!”

Now that Xiahou Yun has learned all twelve sword forms, Bai Zhanli couldn’t think of how Xiahou Yun could lose. When Bai Zhanli raised his head to look at Lin Yun, he had sympathy in his eyes for him.

“First Sword—Endless Clouds!” Lin Yun wielded the Flower Burial on the massive stage and performed the first form of the Aquaheaven Sword Technique. As the sword aura spread out from the Flower Burial Sword, seventy-nine sword intents spread out like an ocean of clouds, and the intent in his sword was close to perfection.

But Lin Yun’s movements were too slow, which made everyone baffled. When everyone was confused, Lin Yun raised his sword, and the forty-nine sword auras spread out like a mist. When the fog enveloped Lin Yun within it, it made Lin Yun look like a sword immortal.

“This…” Everyone in the surroundings was stunned that Lin Yun had reached complete mastery in the first form. Even Bai Zhanli had widened his eyes, looking at Lin Yun like he was looking at a monster.

Second Sword—Moon Courting!

When the mist dispersed, a clear lake appeared with a moon reflected in the lake. Most importantly, Lin Yun had also reached complete mastery in the second form.

Third Sword—Pricking Moon!

When Lin Yun pointed his sword at the moon before pricking it, the moon flew out from the lake and hung high in the sky. Simultaneously, Lin Yun’s sword aura had also soared to the sky.

“Manifestation stage!” The grey-clothed elder who was responsible for testing the participants was dumbfounded. This was because Lin Yun had only used two days to reach the legendary manifestation stage in the third form, and Lin Yun’s monstrous talent made the grey-clothed elder so excited that he began to tremble.

“I…” Xiahou Yun could feel his lips dry, and his expression stiffened on his face. He then squeezed out a smile, “This is only the third sword, so I still have a chance.”

Although he was surprised that Lin Yun had reached the manifestation stage in the third form, he was only slightly surprised because he was confident that he would be the ultimate winner. He speculated that even if Lin Yun’s talent was heaven-defying, the third form should be his limit. This was terrifying, but it was nothing compared to him because he grasped all twelve forms.

Fourth Sword—Rising Clouds!

Fifth Sword—Vast Aquasky!

Sixth Sword—Serene Aquasky!

Seventh Sword—Soaring White Clouds!

But what happened next tore Xiahou Yun’s fantasy apart as Lin Yun increased his speed in executing the sword technique. Lin Yun was moving so fast that it left afterimages around the stage, and Lin Yun had completed eleven forms in the blink of an eye. Most importantly, he had reached the manifestation stage in every sword form.

“Twelfth Sword—Descending Heavenly River!”

When Lin Yun swung his sword out, a majestic phenomenon bloomed. There was even a person unleashing a dazzling sword ray on the moon. When the two figures overlapped, two sword rays connected and formed into a heavenly river that gushed out.

Taking a step back, Lin Yun raised his sword before his chest and was done performing this sword technique. But everyone didn’t have enough of it because they were still submerged in the gorgeous intent that Lin Yun displayed with his sword technique.

“This is the Aquaheaven Sword Technique!”

“Oh my god, Lin Yun reached the manifestation stage in the Aquaheaven Sword Technique in just two days?!”

“I can foresee a new legend being born in the Sword Sect!”

“The Sword Sect has been too quiet in recent years after Jian Jingtian. No legend has appeared after him.”

“But why isn’t Lin Yun going down?” Exclamations resounded in the surroundings.

But then, Lin Yun moved once more with twelve afterimages flying from his body. Each afterimage was a form of the Aquaheaven Sword Technique, and it was so fast that most people couldn’t catch up.

But that wasn’t all, the twelve afterimages separated into thirty-six afterimages, performing three different versions of the Aquaheaven Sword Technique. This created all sorts of phenomena, and sword rays as thirty-six intents represented thirty-six different phenomena.

When all the afterimages combined, Lin Yun soared to the sky with the light of a holy spirit shining on him. What followed after was a dragon roar, along with a dragon aura spreading out. A dragon had flown out of Lin Yun’s body. This dragon was the holy spirit of the Aquaheaven Sword Technique, a Divine White Dragon.

The surroundings exploded. They were so shocked that they nearly fell on their knees. The grey-clothed elder’s eyes became watery when he saw the white dragon. “Three hundred years! It has been three hundred years since the white dragon last appeared!”

It has been three hundred years since someone could summon the holy spirit of the Aquaheaven Sword Technique.

Lin Yun smiled as he rubbed the white dragon’s head. It seemed like his speculation was right. He could only summon the holy spirit after grasping all thirty-six intents.

“So that’s really the case!” Ye Ziling and Zhao Yan exchanged a glance. They could see the shock in each other’s eyes. The two had long discovered something peculiar about this sword technique, but they couldn’t figure it out until now.

When Lin Yun sheathed his sword, he turned to Xiahou Yun, “It’s your turn now, brother.”

When Xiahou Yun recovered from the shock, his face turned red and ugly. How could he compete? The sword technique he comprehended differed from Lin Yun, making him feel like a clown. Now that he had to perform after Lin Yun, he simply wanted to dig a hole for himself and hide in it.

“Haha. Xiahou Yun, it’s your turn now! Don’t cower!”

“I heard you saying that you’ll slap Lin Yun to the ground no matter how high he reaches!”

“Xiahou Yun, it’s your turn!” Bursts of laughter resounded on the plaza, with everyone teasing Xiahou Yun.

Xiahou Yun’s face turned red, and he stuttered after a long time later, “M-My stomach hurts. I’ll be back shortly after visiting the bathroom.”

His words made everyone laugh aloud because Xiahou Yun was simply too humiliating. But Lin Yun suddenly appeared before Xiahou Yun and smiled. “Sure, you can go to the bathroom. But before that, leave the Bodhi Seed behind.”
