Chapter 732 - Skymound City’s Seven Geniuses, Not One Remaining

After shattering the purple moon, Lin Yun landed on the stage like a sword. This made Chen Ziyu and Chu Muyan’s faces change as they both took several steps back. Their faces were unnatural because this was different from what they had imagined.

Lin Yun should have been heavily injured and covered in blood when he landed on the stage, but it was the complete opposite.

“Not good!” Everyone from Chen Clan exclaimed at this scene.

“Don’t worry. This brat is definitely barely standing. Let’s watch Young Master Ziyu kill him.” Chen Wangye said this with flickering eyes. In his opinion, there should be a lot of moonlight left in Lin Yun’s body, which wouldn’t be easy for Lin Yun to deal with.

The reality was as Chen Wangye said, but Lin Yun wasn’t even bothered by it. As his heart throbbed powerfully, boundless vitality would surge throughout his body. No matter how the moonlight tried to sap his vitality, it couldn’t beat the speed of his regenerating vitality.

Listening to Chen Wangye’s words, everyone from the Chen Clan felt relieved. After all, Chen Ziyu was in the pinnacle Yin-Yang stage and had grasped the frost intent.

“Why are you so far back? Didn’t you two say that you would slaughter me like a dog?” Lin Yun provoked them as he swept his glance at Chen Ziyu.

“You think I’m afraid of you?” Chen Ziyu snickered as he activated his frost intent, unleashing his terrifying pressure. His frost intent covered the entire stage in a layer of ice. If it was an ordinary genius, they would have been frozen just by standing on the stage. But Lin Yun wasn’t afraid of this since his sword intent was at complete mastery.

The boundless chill tried to penetrate Lin Yun’s body, but it failed because of the sword intent shrouding him. This made Chen Ziyu frown his brows as he threw his palm over, “Die!”

When he threw his palm out, an eerie wind howled like a ghostly roar. The cold wind was terrifying and anyone underestimating it would be killed. But just when it was about to reach Lin Yun, Lin Yun’s Flower Burial Sword bolted out and stabbed Chen Ziyu’s palm.

Piercing sword intent surged out from his sword that pierced through Chen Ziyu’s palm, causing Chen Ziyu to yell out in pain before he was sent flying. As blood dripped down from the Flower Burial Sword, Lin Yun ridiculed, “Kill me in three moves? You can’t even take a single move from me!”

Chen Ziyu’s right arm drooped while his face burned red. He was enraged because Lin Yun had suddenly become so powerful in just a few days.

“Kill me like slaughtering a dog? I can kill you like cutting weed!” Not giving Chen Ziyu any time to think, Lin Yun pushed the Iris Sword Sutra to the limit and charged over.

Overlord Sword—Breaking Dawn!

Brilliant radiance surged out from Lin Yun as his powerful sword aura soared into the sky. When he slashed out, the Flower Burial Sword shined like the first glimpse of dawn. His sword aura then manifested into a fireball that blazed like the sun and dyed the entire sky red.

“No! No! No!” The Chen Clan’s elders were completely dumbfounded as they waited for Chen Ziyu to show his might. They could tell that Chen Ziyu wouldn’t be able to take this sword head-on. Even they couldn’t take this attack head-on, not to mention Chen Ziyu whose right arm was crippled by Lin Yun.

Under ferocious roars filled with despair, the blazing sun descended. Chen Ziyu’s face changed as he faced this attack and executed various means. But all his means were useless. When the blazing sun descended, Chen Ziyu was torn into pieces. Just like how Lil’ Red was killed by the Profound Note Bell, Chen Ziyu was also ripped into pieces.

The surroundings were silent as everyone widened their mouths in disbelief. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Amid the silence, Lin Yun suddenly spoke, “You think you can run?”

Chu Muyan was cunning, so he had immediately retreated to the side when Chen Ziyu made his move. When he saw Lin Yun’s attack, he instantly knew that no one could save Chen Ziyu. He immediately tossed all thoughts of taking revenge and jumped off the stage. In order to keep his life, he even gave up joining the Indigomoon Elysium.

But the moment he landed on the ground, Lin Yun had already detected him. Lin Yun turned around and looked at him coldly, “You guys incinerated Lil’ Red’s corpse into ashes, right?”

The killing intent contained in Lin Yun’s eyes was sharp enough to pierce through anything. This made Chu Muyan’s heart clench up as he wanted to give himself a slap. What they said earlier was just an empty boast. Back then, no one bothered with the Dragon Blooded Horse’s corpse. But Lin Yun had treated it seriously.

But a smile soon appeared on Chu Muyan’s face. He had already jumped off the stage, so what did he have to be afraid of? He roared, “Where are the experts of the Skycloud Sect?!”

“Here!” yelled the Skycloud Sect’s elders and disciples.

“Everyone, listen up! Kill this sword slave and take revenge for Junior Brother Ouyang Hao!” Hearing their response, Chu Muyan was calm. He then turned to look at Lin Yun coldly, “So what if that bastard was reduced to ashes by me? You think you can slap me to death?”

Qiongqi’s Strength!

In the mysterious space in Lin Yun’s violet palace, the Primordial Chaos Soul unleashed a roar as Qiongqi’s Strength turned into flames alongside the sixteen dragon runes. As his muscles began to squirm, an immense power filled his body.

Boundless vitality exploded out from Lin Yun and he descended from the sky while throwing his palm out. His attack was too fast and his speed wasn’t something the naked eye could see. When he reappeared, he was already above Chu Muyan with flames blazing on his body.

Before Chu Muyan could even raise his head, a palm landed down on him and his body started to tear apart. When Lin Yun’s palm landed on the ground, Chu Muyan had disappeared from the world.

“Who says I can’t kill you with a slap?” asked Lin Yun while the flames blazing on the surface of his body gradually died down. His face was pale as his hair fluttered in the wind like a waterfall. His pupils were deep like an abyss and the purple mark on his forehead looked even more dazzling.

The purple mark was the mark of a sword slave. However, no one dared to say that anymore because he was Flower Burial Lin Yun of the Great Qin Empire’s Sword Firmament Pavilion!
