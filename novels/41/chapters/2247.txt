Chapter 2248 - I'm The Moon In The Clouds

When Lin Yun took off his mask, a handsome face was revealed before everyone.

This left Liu Yunlan, kneeling with one knee on the ground, dumbfounded. He had only seen the portrait of this face before, so it looked unfamiliar at first glance. But he had heard of that slogan countless times. In the Kunlun Realm, who would dare to say that before so many people, aside from Flower Burial Lin Yun?

“Lin Yun…” Liu Yunlan exclaimed.

“Flower Burial!”

“It’s him!”

“How did this fellow dare to show up here? Isn't he afraid of death?” When Lin Yun removed his mask, everyone in the valley was shocked as their gazes fell on Lin Yun.

“It’s him, and he looks exactly like the portrait.” Everyone was stumped because they thought Lin Yun would stay low after revealing himself in the Heavenly Dao Sect on the ninth. But they never expected that he would show up here, in this forbidden ground that only holy lands dared to enter.

“Why did he become so powerful?” Qu Wushuang was stumped. Lin Yun struck a heavy blow on him, completely shattering his pride. So he was naturally more shocked than anyone amongst everyone present. How was this the strength of someone only at the Quasi-Saint Realm? Wasn’t this too unbelievable?

Huang Jingyu and the Heavenly Kui Saint Lord exchanged a gaze with disbelief in their eyes.

“More accurately, I’m Flower Burial Lin Yun of the Radiant’s lineage!” Lin Yun smiled as he looked at Liu Yunlan. He continued, “I’m not from the Sword Emperor’s lineage.”

The moment he said that, he swung his sword, which Liu Yunlan quickly responded to by raising his blade before him. But his attempt to block was useless as he was sent flying a thousand meters away while throwing out a mouthful of blood, clutching his chest in pain.

“Can you hold on?” Lin Yun reached out to Li Feibai, lying on the ground.

“Yeah…” Li Feibai held Lin Yun’s hand and was pulled up from the ground.

“I have done what I promised you,” Li Feibai said as he took out the Divine Blood Fruit.

Lin Yun was briefly stunned, but he could sense all the gazes on him just a moment ago shift to the Divine Blood Fruit. He instantly knew that it wouldn’t be easy to leave here. But he smiled and took the Divine Blood Fruit into his interspatial bracelet.

“Kill him!” The enmity on Li Feibai a moment ago was shifted to Lin Yun.

“You’re courting death!” When everyone hesitated, Huang Jingyu couldn’t hold himself back and charged at Lin Yun. Circulating the Sun-Moon Saint Canon, Huang Jingyu threw out a punch with the sun and moon combined in his attack, “Divine Sun-Moon Fist!”

As the sun and moon revolved, the powerful saint aura he gave off distorted the surrounding space.

“Firefly’s Radiance!” Lin Yun swung his sword.

When the fist and sword ray clashed, the sun and moon shattered as Huang Jingyu took a few steps back.

Lin Yun turned around, defending Li Feibai as he resolved the shockwave in the surroundings.

“Sacred Moonlight Ring!” Huang Jingyu hovered in the air as he pointed his finger at Lin Yun, and the ring on his finger unleashed a beam of light that shot out.

Lin Yun held onto Li Feibai as they soared to the sky to avoid the incoming attack. In that split second, they dodged, and the place where they previously stood exploded with space crumbling. There were many fine fragments and cracks that remained.

Lin Yun was inwardly surprised by the power of this treasure, and he finally knew how strong it was after facing it.

“Golden Thunder Flag!” The Heavenly Kui Saint Lord waved the flag as thunderclouds began to rumble in the sky of ten thousand miles in radius. As terrifying thunder rumbled, golden lightning bolts descended from the vortex, and those bolts felt as though they were unleashed by deities, unleashing an unimaginable power that could easily kill a second-stage Saint Lord.

Although Lin Yun managed to shatter the lightning, he took a few steps back in a hurry.

“S-Save me…” Before Li Feibai could finish, Lin Yun grabbed his collar.

“Withered Tree Coming To Life!” Lin Yun swung his sword and an ancient tree grew from the ground with tens of thousands of petals flying out and his sword intent filling the entire space. When the lightning bolts fell onto those petals, the power of those bolts was greatly reduced, even if they managed to pierce through many petals.

“Great timing!” Lin Yun smiled as he grabbed Li Feibai with his left hand and shuttled through the lightning bolts with the Flower Burial in his right hand, unleashing sword rays with afterimages overlapping. The lightning bolts only managed to inflict superficial injuries on him and couldn’t heavily injure him.

Right then, the Sacred Moonlight Ring shone again. Lin Yun couldn’t avoid it this time since he was carrying Li Feibai, so he could only take this attack head-on with the Azure Dragon Divine Physique. This made him take a few steps back with blood dripping down his lips, and his injuries were serious.

But as the Blue Dragon Bone shone, a blue dragon aura gushed out from him and almost treated his injuries completely in just a few breaths.

“Kill him!” Seeing this, Huang Jingyu and the Heavenly Kui Saint Lord dashed forth, preparing to take advantage of this moment to attack Lin Yun.

But before they could even get close, the surrounding gravity increased with layers of heaven descending that instantly slowed them down, and this was because of Lin Yun executing the Heaven Sword Form.

Huang Jingyu and the Heavenly Kui Saint Lord were anxious because they realized that they couldn’t escape. When Lin Yun turned around, the entire world became black and white as Lin Yun performed the Earth Sword Form with his sword, drawing in the air like ink.

With a gentle flick of his wrist, heaven and earth were inverted as Huang Jingyu and the Heavenly Kui Saint Lord realized they were immobilized mid-air.

“Golden Thunder Flag!”

“Sacred Moonlight Ring!” The Huang Jingyu and the Heavenly Kui Saint Lord were forced to use their treasures, wanting to inflict injuries on Lin Yun.

But Lin Yun merely smiled, facing their attacks, and executed the Profound Sword Form. The Flower Burial Sword was like a bow that gently reverberated before the two attacks were bounced back to where they came from.

This immediately inflicted heavy injuries on Huang Jingyu and the Heavenly Kui Saint Lord. They then threw out a mouthful of blood each and rolled on the ground for a few hundred meters. They threw out another mouthful of blood when they got up with great difficulty.

When they raised their heads, they watched as Lin Yun carried Li Feibai in one hand and the Flower Burial in another, looking like an immortal with a purple mark on his forehead.

“Let’s go!” Lin Yun laughed, wanting to charge out with Li Feibai.

“Kill him!” The other Saint Lords in the valley came to their senses. They knew they couldn’t afford to let Lin Yun leave or they would have no chance to obtain the Divine Blood Fruit.

“How pathetic!” A cold light flashed in Lin Yun’s eyes. The next second, a dazzling golden radiance shone as Lin Yun released his Quasi-Divine Light Sword intent.

When his sword aura spread out, the sword ray he gave off was so dazzling that it looked like a bright sun, lighting up the entire valley. At this moment, he became the sole protagonist of this world.

“Myriad Swords Unite!” As thirty-six afterimages walked out from Lin Yun, they each drew a circle that combined into the Firefly’s Radiance. When the thirty-six rings were lit up, the Firefly’s Radiance shone even brighter than the stars, and a burst of laughter could be heard echoing in the valley.

“Hahaha!”

All the Saint Lords that charged over were sent flying away in the path of the sword rays. They couldn’t get close to Lin Yun and couldn’t withstand his sword rays.

Lin Yun walked as though he was strolling under the chaos. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Who said that the light from a firefly couldn’t compete with the bright moon?” His voice echoed in the valley as he spoke, looking invincible, carrying Li Feibai with one hand and the Flower Burial Sword in the other.

“How the hell is this possible?!” Liu Yunlan wiped the blood off his lips and cursed when he saw this scene. He and those from the Divine Dao Pavilion were also dumbfounded.

Qu Wushuang had become a Saint, and he felt that he should be qualified to compete with Lin Yun even if he couldn’t defeat the latter. But his scalp became numb when he saw this scene.

“Quasi-Divine Light Sword Intent? He has surpassed the Astral Sword Intent?” Qu Wushuang was shocked with the Divine Dao Pavilion’s disciples behind him being dumbfounded.

“I am Flower Burial, burying both flowers and people alike!” Lin Yun laughed as he swung another sword ray, executing Planting Soldiers. Under his sword, those who were planning to launch a sneak attack on him were struck by his sword ray, and all of them were covered in injuries as they wailed out in pain.

Seeing that there were too many people here, a hint of anger flashed in Lin Yun’s eyes, and he no longer held himself back. Circulating the Great Profound Sword Canon and Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon, his Sword, Wind, and Thunder Daos combined with his Quasi-Divine Light Sword Intent.

But that wasn’t all. He activated all four glory spirits within his sword, unleashing a sword ray that reached over a few thousand feet from the sky.

“Open up!” Lin Yun roared as everyone became terrified by this sword. In their eyes, this sword felt like it could even split heaven and earth apart, and this sword couldn’t be blocked.

Under this sword, a crack appeared on the ground, instantly spreading to a few thousand miles away. The valley was like heaven’s gate as it was being split apart.

Seeing this scene, Li Feibai was dumbfounded when Lin Yun held him. This was the ordinary swordsman that he evaluated? This was a Quasi-Saint? You call this a Quasi-Saint?

Li Feibai’s lips twitched, and felt he had become a joke. Even the Sovereign Constellation wasn’t as terrifying as this scene.

Lin Yun threw Li Feibai onto his back, and said, “Hold on!”

But the moment Li Feibai went on his back, he felt that something wasn’t right, and he said, “I didn’t expect Young Master Li to have such a developed chest.”

He had roughly guessed something as he laughed, ignoring Li Feibai’s expression. Some weren’t willing to give up and followed him to the sky.

Looking back, Lin Yun merely gave them a look, but none dared to step forth as they fled, trembling in fear.

“Hahaha! I’m the moon in the clouds and an immortal!” Lin Yun laughed heartily. This should be how a swordsman was, leaving as he left behind his waves of laughter echoing in the valley.
