Chapter 2284 - I Didn't!

“We’re alive thanks to Flower Burial. Otherwise, we would have all lost our lives in the Flame Dragon Valley,” the Clear Nether Sect’s Roost End Saint Lord said. The Clear Nether Sect was a powerful sect in the Eastern Desolation. They might not be comparable to those ancient sects like the Sword Sect in terms of foundation, but they weren’t any weaker in strength. Their Grand Elder was a Great Saint and had Saint Sovereigns in the sect. As for Saint Elders, they had four to five of them.

The Eastern Desolation was so massive that even the six holy lands couldn’t occupy the entire territory. As a result, this gave room for powerful sects to grow. But most of them either had a good relationship with a holy land or were a subsidiary of it. When the Heavenly Dao Sect was in its prime, it had close to a hundred subsidiary forces and even more saint clans.

“You guys are too polite,” Lin Yun smiled.

The Roost End Saint Lord sighed, “You have no idea how close of a call we had with death, but we’re grateful for you. With a genius like you, it’s only a matter of time for the Heavenly Dao Sect to rise again. We will share what happened here with others.”

“That’s right. Those three holy lands don’t deserve their position andare far inferior to the past Heavenly Dao Sect.”

“They’re lacking to be wanting to replace the Heavenly Dao Sect’s position.” The Roost End Saint Lord’s words received many Saint Lords’ acknowledgments with resentment in their voices.

Lin Yun merely smiled and didn’t join in the topic. These forces would follow those who were strong. They would follow the Heavenly Dao Sect if it were strong, then run to the three holy lands once the Heavenly Dao Sect declined. But they were careless and became sacrifices for the three holy lands instead. It was fine if they were dead, but Lin Yun saved them. So, it was natural for them to have resentment against the three holy lands.

Once Lin Yun finished chatting with everyone, he came to the Flame Dragon’s skull, controlling it to fly out of the Heavenly Void. Everyone was looking at his back and discussing amongst themselves.

“Flower Burial isn’t only courageous, he’s even better than the Ming Cult.”

“Agreed. He will help if there’s trouble.”

“He’s the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple and naturally wouldn’t be bad.”

“Everyone says that Tian Xuanzi will be the master of the Eastern Desolation in the future, and the three holy lands have joined forces with him. But Flower Burial could catch up even if the Radiant Sword Saint dies.”

“Everyone knows that Tian Xuanzi is just a chess piece. The Profound Sky Sect will become a new holy land when he becomes an Emperor. At that time, he can gather all eight sects in the Ancient Barren Domain and join hands with the three holy lands. At that time, the Eastern Desolation will belong to the Divine Dragon Empire.”

“Tian Xuanzi is a figure, but Flower Burial isn’t bad. Who knows who will become an Emperor first. Anything can happen with a grand era's arrival.”

“The Eastern Desolation is used to freedom. If Tian Xuanzi becomes the master of the Eastern Desolation, we will be at his mercy.”

“The Divine Phoenix Mountain also has similar thoughts, which is why they formed a good relationship with Flower Burial.”

They were all discussing the situation in the Eastern Desolation. They might not be comparable to a holy land by themselves, but they would be a force to be reckoned with if they gathered up. Lin Yun didn’t know that these people that he had saved would quietly change the situation in Eastern Desolation. Many times, this was how a person’s heart changes things.

“What’s going on? How is this possible? Not only is Lin Yun alive, but he even snatched the divine flame fragment?” After regaining consciousness, the Ying River King was furious upon learning everything that had transpired. He roared, “Zhao Tianyu, is the divine maiden of your sect useless?”

The Ying River King was filled with unhappiness towards Wang Muyan. Zhao Tianyu didn’t speak, but everyone from the Blood Moon Sect furiously looked at the Ying River King. They were furious, showing signs of making a move here as they roared with murderous intent, “Ying River King, you dare humiliate the divine maiden?!”

Zhao Tianyu waved his hand to restrain them and smiled, “Ying River King, you wouldn’t even be able to snatch the divine flame fragment if not for the divine maiden. Even if you had managed to snatch it, you wouldn't have been able to leave with the five holy lands around. Do you agree with what I said?”

The Ying River King’s face was pale as he roared, “Thousands of demonic corpses. Do you think it’s easy to create them?!”

Zhao Tianyu fanned himself with a fan and said, “Ying River King, if I recall correctly, you’re the one who wanted to kill Flower Burial, and you’re also the one who came up with the plan of attacking the five holy lands.”

As he spoke, he gently tapped on the Ying River King’s shoulder with his fan, which made the Ying River King feel a strong blow and nearly go down on his knees. The Ying River King furiously looked at Zhao Tianyu with murderous intent blazing in his eyes, “You!”

Zhao Tianyu closed the fan, and said as he patted his other hand with the fan, “I’m the one who saved you. Without me, Lin Yun would’ve taken your life earlier.”

As he approached the Ying River King, he continued, “So… where did you get the right to blame our divine maiden?”

When he finished speaking, he lashed out with the fan in his hand, sending the Ying River King flying away. This made the Ying River King’s lips twitch before several demonspirits quickly came forth to help the Ying River King back to his feet.

“We’re all rats who can only hide in the dark. As long as the Heavenly Path doesn’t return, you are only a homeless worm…” Zhao Tianyu ignored the Ying River King’s fury. The latter was injured, and there was nothing much he could do.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Rest and treat your injuries. The cooperation between the Blood Moon Sect and Demonspirit Clan has ended. When you’ve recovered, we can discuss the cooperation again. I have matters to attend to, so I won’t stay with you any longer…” Zhao Tianyu stowed the fan in his chest and turned around.

“Zhao Tianyu!” The Ying River King clenched his fist. He would’ve made a move on the spot if he wasn't injured.

A few minutes later, Zhao Tianyu found the injured Wang Muyan. She was treating her injuries with the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda behind her. The injury on her chest had recovered, but her complexion was terrible after suffering the backlash from lifting the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda’s seals.

Wang Muyan opened her eyes, indifferently looking at the incoming Zhao Tianyu. She said, “Sorry. You’re right, and I made a mistake this time.”

Zhao Tianyu walked past Wang Muyan and stared at the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda so that he couldn’t see the helpless expression on her face. He turned around and said, “You didn’t make a mistake. I also didn’t expect Lin Yun to become so powerful, not to mention that he’s so meticulous. Who could imagine that the Flame Dragon would come back to life? Even without the Flame Dragon, I suspect that he could still use other means to snatch the divine flame fragment back.”

Wang Muyan said nothing but had fallen silent.

Zhao Tianyu continued, “Don’t think too much about the divine flame fragment. It’s not bad for us to lie low for now. Lin Yun is blessed with fortune, and facing him head-on is not a good idea. So we should just observe for now while someone deals with him.”

Wang Muyan stood up, and asked, “You’re talking about the Radiant Sword Saint?”

“When the Radiant Sword Saint faces his tribulation, a battle will occur. Tian Xuanzi is also someone blessed with fortune. Two protagonists, one from five hundred years ago and the other the current. I'm unsure who will win. As for the God Burial Mountain Range’s restriction, let’s not think about it for now. I believe the sect master has a plan.”

Wang Muyan looked at Zhao Tianyu, and said, “I want to give it a try again. I don’t want to give up on the divine flame fragment just like that.”

“You have to think it through. He won’t go easy on you again. It was the divine flame fragment that was snatched away this time, but it might be the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda next,” Zhao Tianyu said.

“Don’t worry. He won’t be able to take the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda, no matter what!” Wang Muyan said with a cold face.

Zhao Tianyu’s face changed, but he said nothing.

The Flame Dragon’s skeleton was losing strength after flying for ten thousand miles before it started falling from the sky.

“Thank you,” Lin Yun said as he caressed the Flame Dragon’s skull. The Flame Dragon helped attack the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda, and even its obsession had disappeared.

“The Flame Dragon can’t hold on any longer, so we must split up now. It shouldn’t be dangerous to leave the Heavenly Void,” Lin Yun said, turning around to look at the Saints.

“Flower Burial, you can just tell us what to do.” Everyone had long noticed the Flame Dragon’s situation.

“I don’t have anything for you guys to do. We will leave separately, but keep in mind to stay in groups. I’ll send you guys off last,” Lin Yun smiled as he held onto his chin. When he patted on the Flame Dragon’s skeleton, the skeleton started to break into pieces, each part containing a group of Saints.

Lin Yun stood together with those from the Divine Phoenix Mountain and they swiftly flew through the sky with the Flame Dragon’s skull acting like a boat that carried everyone.

“Lin Yun, look! It’s the three holy lands!” Li Feibai noticed the three holy lands’ parties on the ground.

The three holy lands had noticed the Divine Phoenix Mountain group on the Flame Dragon’s skull and were shocked. Huang Jingyu hid himself in a cloak while standing beside Liu Yunlan, not wanting to be seen by Lin Yun.

“You don’t have to be so cautious. They have already left,” Liu Yunlan said. The Flame Dragon’s skull was flying at a swift speed.

Huang Jingyu removed the hood, and said, “I’m not afraid of him. I just don’t want any accidents to take place.”

His eyes flashed coldly. He still hadn’t given up on killing Lin Yun. But he planned to kill Lin Yun outside the God Burial Mountain Range since it was impossible to kill him within the Heavenly Void. He could only place his hopes on the three holy lands’ men who were outside the God Burial Mountain Range. That's why it was best for him to keep a low profile now and not catch Lin Yun’s attention.

An hour later, Lin Yun landed on the ground with everyone.

“We’ve left the Flame Dragon Valley in less than half a day. We should be safe after crossing the Flame Dragon River,” the Astral River Saint Lord said.

“You guys go ahead first. I’ll follow behind,” Lin Yun said.

“Big Brother Lin, you’re not coming with us?” Ji Zixi asked.

“I have some matters to attend to. So you guys can leave first, I’ll come right after,” Lin Yun smiled.

Li Feibai glanced at Lin Yun and roughly knew what he wanted to do. She smiled, “Let’s go, little princess. He’ll belong to you sooner or later, so you don’t have to be in such a hurry now.”

“I didn’t…” Ji Zixi blushed.

“Hahaha! I know you’re worried about your Big Brother Lin’s safety. But there’s nothing to worry about him because no one can bully him in the Heavenly Void,” Li Feibai said.

“I’ll take my leave now. You guys can wait for me outside the God Burial Mountain Range,” Lin Yun smiled and left.
