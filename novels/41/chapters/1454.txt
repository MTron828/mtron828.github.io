Chapter 1455 - From Today Onwards

Everyone was shocked and in disbelief that Huangfu Yan was sent flying away. No one expected that Huangfu Yan, who was at the three-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm, would lose in a frontal confrontation. Most importantly, Lin Yun didn’t let Huangfu Yan off so easily and chased after him, wanting to give Huangfu Yan a beating while he was down.

This was something unprecedented in the Sword Sect. Someone in the top ten on the Earth Ranking was at a disadvantage against a newcomer. Before the fight, everyone thought about how badly Lin Yun would be beaten. After all, Huangfu Yan clearly had the advantage, regardless if it was his cultivation level or technique.

The plaza before the Great Profound Palace fell into a dead silence, and only Lin Yun’s voice could be heard. When he descended, he punched Huangfu Yan, who was struggling to get back up.

This sent Huangfu Yan flying again with his face turning pale and blood dripping from the corners of his lips. His hair was disheveled and looked pathetic. Huangfu Yan had to take several steps back after taking Lin Yun’s punch before he managed to stabilize himself.

“Impressive. Truly impressive!” Huangfu Yan wiped the blood off his lips, and his expression became grave. He no longer dared to look down on Lin Yun because the latter’s strength had exceeded his imagination. Lin Yun was stronger than his cultivation while being at the one-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm.

“But the game has just begun. We’re swordsmen, and we naturally have to decide the winner with our swords!” Huangfu Yan’s gaze became piercing as a saint sword enveloped in azure light shot out of the sword box that he carried behind him.

When he held onto the saint sword, his hair started to flutter violently, with his sword aura rapidly rising. As the sea of clouds began to rumble, Huangfu Yan’s aura suddenly reached the fourth stage of the Azure Firmament Sword Sutra.

“Fourth stage!”

“So Huangfu Yan also has a trump card. He actually reached the fourth stage in the Azure Firmament Sword Sutra! This should be the trump card he’s been planning on keeping hidden till the Five Peaks Competition.”

“How can he be so easily defeated when he’s ranked in the top ten on the Earth Ranking?” The first three stages of the various peaks’ sword sutra were considered entry-level, and every three stages was a hurdle. They might not be able to make a breakthrough even if they reached the Dragon Pulse Realm. But if they managed to make a breakthrough, their strength would transform.

“Azure Firmament Sword Sutra—Rumbling Clouds and Thunder!” As Huangfu Yan pushed the Azure Firmament Sword Sutra to the limit, he roared and gusts of wind and rumbling thunder began to intertwine to form a painting. The painting contained the howling of gusts and thunder, exuding a terrifying aura.

“I will defeat you today!” Huangfu Yan roared amidst the exclamations in the surroundings while he charged at Lin Yun, and his attack inwardly alarmed many people.

“You want to compete in the sword? You’ll only lose even more terribly!” Lin Yun raised his brow with a cold light flashing through his pupils. The Flower Burial Sword flew out from his sword box when he reached out. The moment he held onto his sword, his figure became blurred in the eyes of everyone as a bizarre scene occurred.

As the Flower Burial Sword flickered, Lin Yun’s surroundings became black like ink as he used his sword like a brush to execute the Carefree 9 Swords—Heaven Sword Form!

Before Huangfu Yan could respond, Lin Yun turned around and drew the second stroke. No matter how ferocious Huangfu Yan’s attack was, Lin Yun easily took his attack as he strolled amidst the violent storm.

As Lin Yun swung his sword, each stroke contained an indestructible mood as his sword rays left brush strokes in the air. It didn’t take long for the sea of clouds to be torn apart.

“Just what kind of monster is this fellow!” Huangfu Yan widened his eyes. His cultivation level and technique was higher, so Lin Yun should be inferior to him in everything apart from his firmament sword intent. But his attacks were being overwhelmed by Lin Yun.

No matter how he tried, his sword techniques were easily resolved by Lin Yun before swinging his sword once more to tear apart his sword aura. When Lin Yun swung his sword again, his brush-like sword rays instantly made Huangfu Yan feel like he had fallen into a quagmire.

Along with a loud collision, the saint sword in Huangfu Yan’s hand began to tremble. He could feel his entire arm go numb, forcing him to take several steps back.

“I don’t believe that I can’t defeat you!” Huangfu Yan’s eyes became bloodshot as he charged over, swinging his sword. But his attack was futile. Lin Yun easily knocked his sword away with a gentle flick.

“Damn it!” Huangfu Yan roared and charged forth again. As he put everything into this attack, the entire plaza began to tremble under his footsteps. When he was about to get close to Lin Yun, his sword aura rose to its peak.

“What a futile attempt.” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with annoyance as he circulated the Dragon-Phoenix Sword Aura in his ocean of astral energy. As he unleashed a domineering aura, a golden light spread out from Lin Yun’s body and his sword aura turned into a dazzling golden light that soared to the sky along with a dragon roar.

When Lin Yun swung his sword, sparks flew, and Huangfu Yan’s saint sword was knocked away. This made Huangfu Yan startled before he quickly retreated and retrieved his sword. But just when he grabbed onto it, a heavy sound echoed from Lin Yun’s body that sounded like a bell.

Using the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra, Lin Yun controlled the Nine-Petaled Netherflower to control the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron in the ocean of astral energy. As ripples spread across the air, Huangfu Yan flew away again.

When his entire body was filled with the destructive aura from the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron, Lin Yun’s eyes turned gold and red with strands of ancient sword intent exploding from his body. His wrists trembled, before he unleashed twenty-nine sword rays, instantly completing the remaining strokes of the Heaven Sword Form.

Carefree 9 Swords—Heaven Sword Form!

Fighting spirit surged within Lin Yun’s heart as his sword rays formed into an ancient ‘heaven’ word with countless sword rays unleashed from it. As every sword rays landed on Huangfu Yan, they forced the latter to retreat by one step for each stroke. When Huangfu Yan landed on the ground, the ancient word had formed and Huangfu Yan’s sword aura instantly collapsed.

When that ancient word descended, Huangfu Yan was forced onto one knee and he threw out a mouthful of blood before his sword powerlessly fell from his hand.

“What sword technique is that?” Everyone in the surroundings was shocked when they saw how Huangfu Yan was suppressed by that ancient ‘heaven’ word. They had never seen such a bizarre sword technique that was linked up like a sword array.

When the Nine-Petaled Netherflower disappeared, Lin Yun’s eye color returned to normal and he walked to Huangfu Yan. This made Huangfu Yan horrified as he tried to get back on his feet, only to realize that he couldn’t move.

Sheathing his sword, Lin Yun waved his hand, and the ancient ‘heaven’ word released a ripple, sending Huangfu Yan flying back once more. When Huangfu Yan fell to the ground again, Lin Yun looked at him and commented, “The top ten of the Earth Ranking? You’re not as impressive as I imagined you to be.”

His words caused an uproar in the surroundings. It seems that Lin Yun also knew that many people in the Sword Sect had resentment about him becoming a heaven direct disciple, especially the top ten of the Earth Ranking. But Lin Yun was clearly not a pushover, and he didn’t have a good temper, unlike what he claimed.

“Lin Yun, don’t be too arrogant! This is only a battle without summoning our constellations!” Huangfu Yan gritted his teeth, and his face flushed. He knew he wouldn’t be able to lift his head in the Earth Ranking after this battle. He came here aggressively to look for Lin Yun, but he didn’t expect that he would suffer such a tragic defeat.

“You’ll only lose even more terribly if we summon our constellations.” Lin Yun said indifferently. “As for arrogance? Then I’ll show you how arrogant I can be!”

Lin Yun suddenly reached out, executing the Azure Dragon Grasp to pull Huangfu Yan over before the latter could react. But just when Huangfu Yan was about to reach Lin Yun, he slammed his palm against Huangfu Yan’s chest. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

This instantly broke all of Huangfu Yan’s ribs, causing his face to turn pale. Everything took place in the blink of an eye. Before everyone recovered from the shock, Huangfu Yan returned to his original spot. However, his ribs were all broken this time, so he was laying on the ground with his pale face distorted from the pain.

“You broke a rib of my junior brother, so I returned it to you tenfold. From today onwards, no one is allowed to bully disciples of my Divine Firmament Peak, even if you’re one of the top ten on the Earth Ranking. Otherwise, the consequences will be at your own risk!” Lin Yun said as he looked around.

Everyone’s lips twitched when they heard what Lin Yun said because he couldn’t just be described as arrogant. The Divine Firmament Peak was ranked at the bottom of the Five Peaks Competition every year, and they didn’t have anyone on the Earth and Heaven Rankings. Could it be that Lin Yun wanted to change all of that by himself?

“Lin Yun…” Chen Ling was shocked by what Lin Yun said. He was bound to be the center of attention after defeating Huangfu Yan, but the first thing he mentioned was the Divine Firmament Peak. But what made Chen Ling even more touched was that Lin Yun took vengeance on his behalf.

“Huangfu Yan, remember to hand the hundred thousand contribution points over to my junior brother, and I’m grateful for this gift. If you’re still unconvinced, you can look for me again at the Divine Firmament Peak. Perhaps all of the disciples of my Divine Firmament Peak will be able to enter the Great Profound Palace in one go. Let’s go!” Lin Yun smiled and landed beside Chen Ling.

Chen Ling was shocked, hearing that Lin Yun wanted to give him the hundred thousand contribution points, which would allow him to enter the Great Profound Palace. But shortly after, unprecedented excitement flashed in his pupils. He had no idea how long it had been since he had last felt his blood boiling after joining the Sword Sect for so many years, but he knew that the Divine Firmament Peak would rise this time!
