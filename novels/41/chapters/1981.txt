Chapter 1982 - Dance (1)

Lin Yun’s music exploded. When he destroyed the lightning vortex created by Nie Wushuang, it reached the latter in the blink of an eye. His music was like an army galloping through the plains, and this made the faces of many Divine Dao Pavilion’s disciples change and involuntarily take several steps back. They couldn’t believe that this was real.

They could believe that Nie Wushuang was defeated. This was something they didn’t expect. Even Nie Wushuang was shocked, and he nearly exclaimed. But he came from a musical clan and immediately reacted by using the unique playing technique of the Nie Clan, playing a few hundred musical notes in a single breath.

As the musical notes overlapped, the intent of his song was pushed to the limit. He was enveloped in a crimson radiance, with his hair fluttering in the wind as he roared, “Merciless!”

When the two phenomena collided, the entire plaza began to tremble with waves of terrifying aura. The sheer shockwave of the clash made many people fly away.

“A battle between music can be so terrifying?”

“Did Nie Wushuang manage to block it?”

“It looks like we can’t underestimate musicians!” Everyone was surprised, and they were shocked by Ye Qingtian’s performance. Nie Wushuang wasn’t inferior either, especially when he released such a powerful phenomenon at the last moment.

When the two phenomena clashed again, a vortex formed where Nie Wushuang was, and the surrounding tables were destroyed with a terrifying shockwave spreading out. The Divine Dao Pavilion’s saint disciples also retreated when they saw this scene.

A moment later, everyone quickly raised their heads when the phenomena disappeared. They saw Nie Wushuang’s hair disheveled with his face pale. All the strings on his zither also snapped, but that wasn’t all; soon after, the zither exploded and broke into two.

“He lost!” Everyone was shocked by this scene with their mouths wide open. Ye Qingtian won?!

Ye Qingtian sat before the zither with a cocky smile on his face. This was his signature ‘smile’ that made him look cocky. Naturally, this made many people furious, but they could do nothing about it. After all, Ye Qingtian was facing Nie Wushuang on behalf of the Heavenly Dao Sect. So not only did everyone not feel angry about it, they even cheered.

“Is that the best a musical clan has to offer? Someone like you wants to play for our holy maiden?”

“Young Master Wushuang seemed a little weak. After all, our Senior Brother Ye only knows bits and pieces about music dao.”Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Hahaha! Nie Wushuang, weren’t you really arrogant earlier?”

“Who do you think you are to be cocky in the Heavenly Dao Sect? Hurry up! Kowtow to Senior Brother Ye and admit your wrongs!” The Heavenly Dao Sect’s disciples laughed. They weren’t pushovers; they were all prideful people within the Eastern Desolation. They just felt suffocating earlier under Nie Wushuang. They were furious when they heard Nie Wushuang's cocky words, who said he would lose if anyone could get within thirty steps of him. This was why they vented their emotions when Nie Wushuang was at a disadvantage.

The faces of the Divine Dao Pavilion’s disciples became ugly. Nie Wushuang’s face was also ugly, and he no longer had his elegance.

“Erhu!” Nie Wushuang said coldly. With a wave, he caught the erhu thrown at him. When he started playing it, a piece of sorrowful music began to spread with moonlight shining on him.

“Moon Reflected on the Erquan Spring!” Bai Shuying’s face changed. This was the song played by Flower Burial.

“It’s really the erhu!”

“Isn’t this the song that made Flower Burial famous at the Nirvana Banquet?”

“Ye Qingtian is finished now. So Nie Wushuang really knows how to play the erhu!” Everyone’s faces changed and became grave.

The erhu was an ancient musical instrument in the Kunlun Realm, and it was long lost. But it reappeared during the Nirvana Banquet. There were rumors that the musical clans immediately searched the ancient records and could only find bits and pieces about the erhu.

When Nie Wushuang started playing the erhu, Lin Yun’s phenomenon was shattered, and his music became chaotic.

“Hmph!” Nie Wushuang snorted with disdain, looking at Ye Qingtian. Anyone could tell that he worked hard to practice the Moon Reflected on the Erquan Spring, which meant there was an expert in the musical clan.

Lin Yun could tell with a glance. It should’ve been a powerhouse who grasped the Imperial Tone and deduced the song score, not to mention the special techniques they found in the ancient records. This was why the Moon Reflected on the Erquan Spring played by Nie Wushuang wasn’t inferior to his. In some aspects, it was even better than him.

With a glance, Lin Yun could tell that Nie Wushuang’s erhu wasn’t simple. It wasn’t inferior to the erhu in the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion.

Right then, a zither string snapped on Lin Yun’s zither, and his hand was cut by it. As Lin Yun continued to play, the strings began to snap, and the energy exploded from the zither, nearly cutting off his ten fingers.

“You want to compete with me?” Nie Wushuang sneered, and he continued to play the erhu. His musical notes swept out like a dragon tail sweeping at Lin Yun.

As sadness began to invade Lin Yun’s emotions, this instantly reduced his combat power, and his movements became stiff. Ultimately, he had to soar to the sky to avoid this blow. A huge crack swept the place he previously sat, and the soundwave continued to sweep over Lin Yun.

Lin Yun could only keep dodging in the air, but took several blows because he couldn’t avoid them in time.

“Great!”

“As expected of Young Master Wushuang. This person needs to be taught a lesson!” Ye Qinghong cheered, drawing enraged gazes from the surrounding Heavenly Dao Sect’s disciples. Even the Profound Maiden Courtyard’s disciples were fuming with anger.

“Haha!” Ye Qinghong smiled awkwardly. But he wasn’t too bothered about it as he exchanged a gaze with Bai Yizhou.

“This is the outcome of wanting to compete in music with Young Master Wushuang!” The Divine Dao Pavilion’s disciples laughed.

This made Wang Yue and the others grit their teeth and become nervous as they looked at Ye Qingtian.

Suddenly, a loud explosion resounded from the sky as Lin Yun threw a punch at the invisible dragon's tail. He wiped the blood off his lips, and didn’t panic. He took those blows on purpose. “I finally regained some strength now and nearly fell into the music because it was too gentle.”

This was to warm himself up by using the pain to pull him out of the sadness. He had belittled Nie Wushuang; this fellow did have some strength.

“Ye Qingtian, consider it your win if you can reach ten steps within me.” Nie Wushuang regained his confidence and grinned.

Lin Yun couldn’t help laughing, looking at Nie Wushuang trying to show off. Nie Wushuang still had no idea who he was facing. As he dodged the incoming attacks, Lin Yun turned around and smiled, “Actually, I do know how to play the erhu as well. I wonder which big sister is willing to lend me their erhu?”

His smile charmed the disciples of the Profound Maiden Courtyard, but they were anxious.
