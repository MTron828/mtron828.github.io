Chapter 605 - Get Lost!

When Lin Yun slowly raised his head to look at Ji Wuye, there was no fear in his eyes. In fact, there was only indifference. This was the pride of Flower Burial.

When his gaze met with Ji Wuye, sparks began to fly between their eyes. Although neither of them did anything, everyone could clearly sense the tension.

In the next second, everyone began to get irritated. Ji Wuye was ranked third on the outer ranking and his nickname was the Bloody Butcher. Even Lu Shixiong who was ranked eighty-seven had his eyes dug out because he said something. Additionally, those who were killed by him didn’t even dare to retaliate.

The fear of Ji Wuye had long been rooted in everyone’s heart, but Lin Yun actually dared to stand against Ji Wuye publicly? It wasn’t a simple interruption but a blatant provocation. Those were words that even the likes of Yan Kong, Qin An, and Xie Yunqiao didn’t dare to say.

But Lin Yun said it publicly, which was a great shock to everyone. Even Zhang Yuan and the rest by the side were greatly terrified. Clearly, even Zhang Yuan had lost his courage before Ji Wuye.

Yan Kong and the other disciples from the Ghostflame Sect looked at this scene with interest. After all, not everyone dared to speak to Ji Wuye in this manner. In the Cloud Trigram Sect’s direction, even Bai Lixuan was looking at Lin Yun with shock in his eyes.

“This person is already dead. What a pity that you no longer have the opportunity to fight him,” said Xie Yunqiao.

“This brat is courting death to jump right in.”

“He probably has something loose in his mind.” The other Cloud Trigram Sect’s disciples sneered with disdain as they looked at this scene. Even Qin An and Pei Yue were watching with interest.

“He’s so dead.”

“He’s probably too arrogant after killing Leng Haoyu, but Leng Haoyu wasn’t even qualified to stand before Ji Wuye.”

“Based on Ji Wuye’s temper, his rage might even spread to the Heavenly Sword Sect and Heavenly Province Academy!”

“Who knows, Ji Wuye’s junior brother might have been killed by them. Ji Wuye’s anger will probably dissipate after killing them.” Everyone in the surrounding area discussed the situation.

However, Lin Yun faced this calmly as he wasn’t affected by the surrounding discussions at all. He was only looking at Ji Wuye with his sword intent and origin energy merging within his body.

“I like people who are bold. Those who don’t even have any courage are boring to kill.” A smile rose on Ji Wuye’s face, which shocked everyone. But his smile was so eerie that it sent chills down their spines. Suddenly, Ji Wuye’s tone changed as he looked at the likes of Zhang Yuan and Mo Ling, “But what a pity. You need to possess the strength to back up your words. Today, all of you are dead. None of you can leave this place alive.”

“Then you can give it a try and see who’ll die first, those on my side or those on your side,” said Lin Yun coldly, which surprised many people.

“You’re the first one to die!” Ji Wuye soared into the sky and his killing aura crashed down like a mountain.

“Ji Wuye made his move!”

“This Lin Yun seems to have a trump card of some sort for him to be so composed…”

Everyone’s heart was beating wildly when they saw this scene. At the same time, they were surprised that Lin Yun would stand under Ji Wuye’s killing aura. One must know that the reason why Ji Wuye dealt with Lu Shixiong so quickly was partly because he was affected by Ji Wuye’s killing aura.

“Someone trying to do the impossible,” snickered Ji Wuye as he sent his palm down. Before his palm even landed, the torrential killing aura around him began to tremble and those who were affected by it were sent out flying.

Everyone looked at Ji Wuye’s palm with shock in their eyes. After all, it was simply too powerful. Ji Wuye wasn’t even so intimidating when he was dealing with Lu Shixiong earlier. It looks like he was truly enraged this time.

“This fellow really flew into a rage,” sighed Yan Kong as his smile disappeared from his face.

Xie Yunqiao, on the other hand, revealed a smile, “This person is finished.”

But in the next second, Lin Yun had formed seals with his left hand and a boundless killing aura equal to Ji Wuye’s exploded from Lin Yun. Lin Yun killing aura wasn’t as shocking as Ji Wuye, but it was like a boundless ocean.

This was naturally the Seven Slaughtering Seal. After multiplying his killing aura seven times and mixing his xiantian sword intent into his fist, Lin Yun threw out a punch. Right at this moment, his temperament had undergone a huge transformation as he looked like a lofty mountain before Ji Wuye.

“This…” Ji Wuye was surprised as he never expected such a powerful aura to come from Lin Yun. In the blink of an eye, regret began rising in his heart as he had only used 30% of his strength in this attack. In the end, he had still underestimated Lin Yun.

But there was no medicine for regret in the world as Lin Yun barked, “Get lost!” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

When the palm and fist came into contact, the two killing aura clashed together and caused a huge explosion.

After the explosion dissipated, everyone looked at the scene before them with disbelief. Not only did Lin Yun receive Ji Wuye’s attack, but he even sent Ji Wuye flying. Although Ji Wuye suffered no injuries, the impact left everyone shocked. “Lin Yun isn’t dead?”

Lin Yun’s hair fluttered in the wind as the origin energy within his body tumbled. But he still managed to suppress the energy from Ji Wuye’s palm without taking a step back. At the same time, no one had expected that the Bloody Butcher Ji Wuye would actually suffer a loss when facing Lin Yun.

“My heavens, he took it!”

“Unbelievable! He actually resisted Ji Wuye’s killing aura…”

“Not only did he block Ji Wuye’s killing aura, but he also blocked Ji Wuye’s palm.”

“Is this all of Ji Wuye’s strength? This doesn’t make any sense…” Everyone in the surrounding area burst into an uproar after a brief silence as they voiced their doubt at Ji Wuye’s strength.

But right at this moment, a crimson beam shot out from Ji Wuye that took his aura to a whole new level that far exceeded the Yang stage. It was only then that the voices in the surrounding died down and no one dared to utter another word.

“Ji Wuye, I swear that you can only dream of having the empyrean’s legacy if you dare to take another step forward,” barked Mo Ling as she took a step forward just when Lin Yun was about to bring out the Iris Sword Array. Her pupils were flickering with golden light as a terrifying aura was gradually being released by her.

Lesser divine ability! The three words appeared in everyone’s mind when they sensed the terrifying spiritual rune aura she was giving off.

Yan Kong smiled and spoke up, “I heard that Mo Ling of the Heavenly Province Academy is the only one around our age to grasp a lesser divine ability. I wonder how strong it is compared to the Bloody Butcher.”

Ji Wuye’s face became dark when he heard that because he knew things were getting troublesome now. Regardless of the aura coming from Lin Yun or Mo Ling, they weren’t people he could deal with easily. And if he was injured in the fight, then he would naturally have to give up on the Astral Pearl.

But right at this moment, the stars in the sky glowed brilliantly as the seal to the empyrean’s tomb also became unstable.

“The seal broke!” Exclamations came from the surrounding area as everyone charged at the empyrean’s tomb.

“Let’s go!” Qin An and Pei Yue also headed for the empyrean’s tomb, followed by Xie Yunqiao and Yan Kong.

Even Ji Wuye couldn’t hold back anymore as he looked at Lin Yun coldly, “Don’t let me see you in the empyrean’s tomb or I’ll let you know a fate worse than death!”

Then, a crimson radiance burst out from him as he charged towards the empyrean’s tomb as well.

Seeing that Ji Wuye had left, Zhang Yuan and the others finally felt let out a breath of relief.
