Chapter 850 - Divine Dragon Era

Everyone’s face began to change after the chief judge explained the competition to them. It turned out that there was an ancient path in the starry light for the tens of thousands of realms. However, the chief judge didn’t tell them about its origin.

Furthermore, the path was concealed most of the time so that no one could find its position. The path would only open when a new era was arriving. There were countless inheritance and ancient ruins in the path that even made the geniuses from the bigger world envious.

But there was no way those from the bigger world could descend onto the path because it was an opportunity that belonged to the geniuses of the lower realm. The entrance to the bigger world was at the end of the path, which was why people called it the Heavenly Path.

The competition that the chief judge was talking about was simple to understand. There were many realms like the Profound Amber Realm who sent their geniuses to the Heavenly Path to compete for the opportunities.

“The fate of geniuses like all of you is to join the worst sects in the bigger world. It’s impossible for you guys to compete with the geniuses in the bigger world, especially since it’s their homeground.” The chief judge paused briefly before he continued, “But it’s different now. The Heavenly Path is an opportunity for all of you. As long as you can come out of the path and rely on yourself to obtain opportunities, you will have a chance. Not only will you transform entirely, but you can also join the powerful sects.”

Join the powerful sects? Lin Yun understood the chief judge’s words. In the past, geniuses would never be absorbed into the powerful sects, but it was different now with the Heavenly Path. This gave everyone a chance to compete with the geniuses from the bigger world. However, the path wasn’t easy and was filled with countless dangers.

“What kind of place is the bigger world?” Bai Lixuan asked. When Bai Lixuan asked the question, everyone else’s eyes flickered with interest. After all, they had only heard bits and pieces about it so far.

The chief judge wore a solemn expression and explained, “It’s a place where holy sons, holy maidens, and demons can be found. It’s a world where geniuses are as plentiful as the rain. The bigger world is called Kunlun, Kunlun of the Divine Dragon Era. It’s a place where everyone pursues their dreams over immortality!”

Although the chief judge spoke with a grave expression, his eyes were glowing with vigor. Clearly, he was in high spirits.

After listening to the chief judge’s words, everyone’s heart beat violently. It was so loud that they could hear each other’s hearts. Compared to the Kunlun Realm, the Profound Amber Realm was just a lake. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Even though Lin Yun already knew about the bigger world, he also couldn’t stay calm. He had many dreams for the bigger world that the chief judge was talking about. Especially since Drifting Goblet, Su Ziyao, and Li Wuyou were waiting for him.

“You guys still have two months before you head to the Profound Amber Mountain. At that time, you will have to fight for the qualification to enter the Heavenly Path. Don’t waste the next two months. I bet all of you have heard that the Ancient Southern Domain has been ranked at the bottom of the Profound Amber Realm after the Sword Sect’s annihilation.” The chief judge then said in a grave expression, “I hope you guys are prepared. There’s a huge gap between the Ancient Southern Domain and the other domains. The other domains have had the Dragoncloud Treasury appear multiple times, so you should know how strong they are.”

After hearing what the chief judge said, everyone became solemn. Jiang Ziye and Nangong Wanyu were especially solemn because they had traveled to the other domains. Through their experiences, they understood how large the gap was. However, it was uncertain if the Ancient Southern Domain would lose because they benefited greatly from the treasury. The Ancient Southern Domain never lacked the comprehension nor the talent, they simply lacked luck. With the appearance of Lin Yun, they were finally given a chance to compete with the other domains.

“Lin Yun.” The chief judge turned to look at Lin Yun and continued, “According to the usual practice, the champion can issue a request to the Sacred Alliance. The Sacred Alliance’s foundation might not be comparable to what you obtained in the Dragoncloud Treasury, but we still have some pellets, techniques, and even divine runes. You can take your pick. Additionally, it’s also possible for you to request a quota to the Heavenly Path.”

What the chief judge said surprised the top ten. After all, this was a blatant hint that the Sacred Alliance wanted to ensure Lin Yun’s entry into the Heavenly Path. Then again, it made sense. If a genius like Lin Yun couldn’t enter the Heavenly Path, it would be a great loss to the entire Ancient Southern Domain and possibly even the Profound Amber Realm.

Lin Yun pondered briefly before he made a request, “Thank you. But I would like to compete for the quota based on my own capability. The Sacred Alliance has always taken a neutral position among the various sects, but I hope that you guys can look after my sect, the Sword Firmament Pavilion.”

The moment Lin Yun said that, the elders of the Sacred Alliance started whispering to each other in disbelief. Even the chief judge was surprised by Lin Yun’s request. After all, Lin Yun had the opportunity to guarantee his entry to the Heavenly Path and to compete with countless geniuses. After he entered the Heavenly Path, he would then have nothing to do with the Sword Firmament Pavilion anymore.

The chief judge was quite surprised that Lin Yun was so concerned about his sect. A brief moment later, the elders finished discussing among themselves and the chief judge replied, “With your fortune in the Ancient Southern Domain, the Sword Firmament Pavilion has already benefited. Logically speaking, no one would be foolish enough to cause trouble to a sect with such fortune. However, since you’ve requested it, I can promise you that the Sacred Alliance will help the Sword Firmament Pavilion three times.”

“Thank you, senior.” Lin Yun bowed because he now had no worries.

“You guys can return for now. Someone from the Sacred Alliance will lead you to the Profound Amber Mountain two months from now.” The chief judge waved his hand, signalling that everyone could leave.

Everyone bowed before they left. What they heard today was too shocking, especially when it came to the bigger world that the chief judge mentioned.

Wu Xiaotian was at a loss as he smiled bitterly, “So the Draconic Banquet is just the beginning…”

Although he managed to make it into the top ten, he wasn’t able to obtain a single victory in the top ten. The impact he suffered was too great. It was already tough enough for him in the Ancient Southern Domain, so he knew that he had no fate with the Heavenly Path. It was fine if he didn’t know about the Heavenly Path, but now, he felt terrible knowing that he would miss his chance.

“But you’ll still try, right?” Jiang Ziye asked seriously.

“I…” Wu Xiaotian looked at Jiang Ziye and was filled with complicated emotions.

Jiang Ziye had disappointment on her face as she replied, “Wu Xiaotian, why are you in despair? We’re all aiming for the bigger world. Is it hard for you to recover in two months? If you’re still like this two months from now, then I don’t want to see you at the Profound Amber Mountain. Junior brother, let’s go.”

Bai Lixuan nodded his head and followed behind Jiang Ziye. As for Wu Xiaotian, his face changed briefly before he became decisive. He made his decision and left the group with a darkened face.

Everyone else also wore grave expressions because they could feel the pressure. Right now, they were fighting for every single second, so they couldn’t waste their time. Even if they couldn’t obtain the quota in the end, they didn’t want to have any regrets.

Only Lin Yun and Yue Weiwei were able to casually chat. At this point, Lin Yun was confident that Yue Weiwei probably came for the Heavenly Path. Since the Heavenly Path wouldn’t appear in Kunlun Realm, one could only pay the price and descend to a lower realm. Perhaps there was something she needed in the Heavenly Path. If that was the case, then he had to help her no matter what.

“Let’s say goodbye for now. Take care of yourself .” Yue Weiwei smiled with her pale face. Looking at her complexion, Lin Yun instantly knew that she hadn’t completely recovered from the repercussions of suppressing the Indigoflame Thunderwhip.

Sensing Lin Yun’s gaze, Yue Weiwei instantly blushed. She smiled before speaking with a grave expression, “I’m fine. Furthermore, didn’t you get revenge for me? Don’t worry, I’ll kill Yu Haotian myself the next time I see him.”

“Fortune is really tricky. If someone can escape death once or twice, it might be a coincidence. But if they can survive a third time… that’s a bit terrifying. You can’t allow it to happen a third time or there will be consequences.” Yue Weiwei’s expression was grave when she mentioned Yu Haotian. After a brief pause, she continued, “I heard from the Heavenly Demon Pavilion’s pavilion master that the Indigomoon Elysium was related to Sword Sect’s annihilation. Their cultivation technique also gave me a feeling that’s similar to a cultivation technique of a certain sect in Kunlun Realm.”

Lin Yun fell in deep thought and memorized Yue Weiwei’s words.

“Hehe, see you in two months.” Yue Weiwei tidied Lin Yun’s clothes before she left.
