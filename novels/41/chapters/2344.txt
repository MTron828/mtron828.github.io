Chapter 2345 - Chaos

No one expected Lin Jiangxian to be a seventh-stage Saint Lord, nor that her Divine Light Sword Intent would be so powerful that even Gu Tian couldn’t do anything to her. A few minutes later, Gu Tian was covered in wounds. No one had expected this outcome. This shocked everyone and had a huge impact.

“This makes no sense. How can the chief disciple of the Azure Cloud Realm be so powerful?”

“This is unbelievable. Don’t forget that Flower Burial hasn’t made his move.”

“This is weird. Since Lin Jiangxian is a seventh-stage Saint Lord, why is she following Flower Burial?’

“If that’s true, doesn’t that mean Lin Yun really has Golden Dao Fruits?” Discussions resounded from the surroundings since everyone wasn’t just curious about Lin Jiangxian but Lin Yun as well.

Hearing the voices from the surroundings, the faces of those from the Gu Clan became ugly. A fiery-tempered youth beside Gu Jun roared, “Gu Tian, can you do it? You’ve embarrassed Big Brother Jun by proving that you can’t even deal with someone who possesses mortal blood.”

This person’s name was Gu Xing. He had a good relationship with Gu Jun, and he was only second in comparison to Gu Jun.

Gu Tian felt a headache, and he gritted his teeth, “Don’t worry about it. She’s nothing even if she’s at the same cultivation as me.” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

He did have trump cards as a descendant of a Divine Clan. One required him to ignite his deity’s bloodline to boost his strength. But it was too humiliating that he had to ignite his deity’s bloodline to deal with a chief disciple from the Azure Cloud Realm.

“Mortal blood? I even dare to dig a deity’s tomb, not to mention dealing with you guys.” Xiong Tiannan could feel something scratching his heart while looking at Lin Jiangxian’s cultivation at the seventh-stage Saint Lord. As someone who became a saint through his physique, his physique improved even if he didn’t make a breakthrough with the Golden Dao Fruit. He laughed, and he leaped to the sky.

“You’re courting death!” The Gu Clan’s geniuses saw that Xiong Tiannan was only a sixth-stage Saint Lord, and they attacked him.

“Hahaha! Great!” Xiong Tiannan laughed as golden light shone in his eyes, with starlight forming into golden flames within his palm, instantly attracting everyone’s attention.

“The Great Solar Flame!” Someone exclaimed.

When the Great Solar Flame shot out from Xiong Tiannan’s palm, those who wanted to block his way were sent flying away.

“The Golden Crow Divine Physique?” Lin Yun instantly noticed that Xiong Tiannan’s divine physique had transformed, with several Golden Crow Divine Runes in his chest shining brightly, giving off a frightening aura.

“It looks like there’s nothing impressive about the Ancient Divine Clan. Mortal blood? My golden crow bloodline is more noble than you people!” Xiong Tiannan laughed as the divine runes shone brightly and looked like a bright sun.

The three from the Gu Clan tried to block him, but they couldn’t stop Xiong Tiannan. On the contrary, their attacks did nothing when they landed on him, and Xiong Tiannan made them throw out blood with punches and kicks. It felt like they had clashed with a sun, with flames burning them, and causing them to scream in pain.

“Xiong Tiannan?”

“Isn’t he ranked at the bottom of the Brandished Dragon Ranking? Since when did he become so strong?”

“A tomb raider like him is so strong?” Xiong Tiannan’s strength shocked everyone.

“Aren’t they too strong to fight the Divine Clan head-on?”

“This is good. I don’t like them who belittled us because of their deity’s bloodline.” Many cultivators were unhappy with the Divine Clans, so they all cheered for Xiong Tiannan.

After Xiong Tiannan exhibited his power, he approached Ji Zixi and fought the other Gu Clan’s geniuses with her.

“This fellow hasn’t changed one bit. He’ll bring you trouble sooner or later.” A person appeared beside Lin Yun. It was Ao Jue. Like Lin Jiangxian, he was also a chief disciple from the Azure Cloud Realm.

Lin Yun was surprised by Ao Jue’s appearance, but he had no enmity against this person. He replied, “Many troubles were determined when I obtained the Golden Dao Fruits. So we might as well have a satisfying fight.”

Ao Jue raised his brow with excitement shining in his eyes because he liked Lin Yun’s temper.

“Xiong Tiannan, are you tired of living?!” Gu Xing roared after recognizing Xiong Tiannan.

“Big Brother Xing, let me deal with him.” A young man stood out from the Gu Clan’s geniuses. His name was Gu Feichen, a genius of the younger generation. His cultivation was also at the seventh-stage Saint Lord.

“Great!” Xiong Tiannan rejoiced to see Gu Feichen charging at him. He already wanted to test his strength after seeing that Lin Jiangxian could fight a seventh-stage Saint Lord. Since he had decided to stand out, he naturally had to show his best.

“You’re courting death!” Gu Feihen was shocked and was caught by surprise before taking a few steps back.

At the same time, a golden seal appeared on Gu Tian’s forehead with an ancient aura sweeping out, looking as though a deity had drawn it. This shocked everyone in the surroundings because they knew that Gu Tian was activating his deity’s bloodline.

When the bloodline was activated, Gu Tian’s strength underwent a considerable boost and forced Lin Jiangxian to take a few steps back. But after sending Lin Jiangxian back, he ignored her and turned to look at Ji Zixi instead.

Ji Zixi was fighting with sixth-stage Saint Lords, but they couldn’t do a thing to her and were heavily injured instead.

Gu Tian unleashed a sneak attack with his punch landing on Ji Zixi’s shoulder. Fortunately, Ji Zixi was a Heavenly Phoenix Maiden with phoenix fire protecting her and merely suffered some light injuries. But the Gu Clan’s geniuses didn’t let such a good opportunity go and charged forth, wanting to inflict heavy injuries on Ji Zixi.

This made Lin Yun frown since Ji Zixi was too inexperienced in fighting. If he was the one fighting, Gu Tian’s sneak attack wouldn’t be successful.

The other Gu Clan’s geniuses, aside from Gu Jun and Gu Xing, made their moves as well. Not only did they manage to force Xiong Tiannan back, but they surrounded him and Ji Zixi. When Lin Jiangxian saw this scene after regaining her footing, a cold light flashed in her eyes.

“Since you guys aren’t going to play fair, don’t blame me for being ruthless!” Lin Jiangxian executed the Heavenly Divine Sword with five element sword intents around her as she charged forth. She was like a divine dragon with a five-colored radiance around her and a giant sword behind her. In a few breaths, several people were sent flying by them. She didn’t hold back any longer, even if they had used their constellations, which she unleashed sword rays to tear those constellations apart.

This was a shocking scene that left everyone dumbfounded. In the blink of an eye, everyone who ganged up on Xiong Tiannan and Ji Zixi was sent flying away with only Gu Feichen and Gu Tian standing before her.

The battle was chaotic as both parties completely fell out and even resorted to using their constellations.

“It looks like this matter can’t be resolved,” Ao Jue smiled, curious about how Lin Yun would deal with this situation.

But Lin Yun merely looked at him, and said, “Have you ever thought of the possibility that I don’t want this matter to end so easily?”

Ao Jue was dumbfounded upon hearing that.

As Lin Jiangxian unleashed her sword intent, she used a sword to force Gu Tian and Gu Feichen to take a few steps back. Raising her head, she looked at the two indifferently, “Do you guys think we’re pushovers?”

“Someone with mortal blood dares to bully the Divine Blood?!” Gu Feichen was furious.

Xiong Tiannan became furious upon hearing that. Gu Yuxin provoked them, and he wouldn’t believe that she wasn’t under anyone’s orders from the Gu Clan. Not to mention that the Gu Clan’s arrogance made him furious.

Gu Feichen mocked, “Am I wrong? An acquired divine physique dares to say that you possess the Golden Crow’s bloodline? Who gave you the face to say that?”

The Gu Clan was arrogant and still had disdain in their eyes.

“Who gave you guys the guts to repeatedly challenge an Ancient Divine Clan? You guys won’t grow some memories if I don’t teach you a lesson.” Gu Jun slowly stepped down from the stairs with murderous intent brewing in his eyes. As he stepped forth, a powerful aura swept out that felt like a mountain crushing everyone.

“Why don’t you make a move then? Let me see who will teach whom a lesson today,” a voice resounded as a sword ray soared to the sky and enveloped everyone.

When Ji Zixi and the rest turned around, they saw Lin Yun slowly approaching.
