Chapter 1107 - Passing the Test

When Lin Yun returned to the tenth test, he could see a boundless sea of clouds ahead of him. Then, he raised his head and looked at the peak. At this moment, he was right in front of the cliff.

He could clearly sense that he might not be able to travel through the air because the abyss below the cliff would devour him. It had been millennia since someone made it to the peak, and he had no idea how lonely the person must be waiting at the peak.

“Emerald stars beyond the azure sky!” Lin Yun muttered while he looked up ahead.

“You have already recited it several times. Lin Yun, do you really know how to ascend the peak?” Lil’ Purple doubted while she was in the sword box.

Hearing that, Lin Yun smiled, “Let me ask you. What’s the meaning of emerald stars beyond the azure sky?”

“Stars outside the sky?” Lil’ Purple replied.

“That’s right. What is in the sky? Clouds!” Lin Yun said with his eyes blazing. “I can see the mountain above the clouds, but the statues are right. This is as far as the mountain goes, and the path is done. The next three tests are three mountains. There’s one mountain for each test. Those are the three strongest swords in the Fleeting Cloud Thirteen Swords!”

“That’s just your speculation,” said Lil’ purple.

“Lass, don’t you think that this mountain is a little too lonely? It has been so many years, but no one is able to ascend it despite seeing it. So much so that this is also the reason why I’m able to see the verse,” smiled Lin Yun.

“So what? How can anyone travel in the clouds? You’ll die if you guess incorrectly,” replied Lil’ Purple.

“Hahaha!” Lin Yun laughed. “As a swordsman, why would I be afraid of death?!” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

As Lin Yun laughed, he soared into the sky and charged forward. At the same time, the path ahead of him had changed into a boundless abyss.

“Hey!” Lil’ Purple exclaimed from the sword box.

While Lin Yun was in the sky, he could sense that his origin energy was sealed along with his sword intent. Fixing his target on a cloud, Lin Yun knew that he would fall if his speculation was wrong. At the same time, he could hear ferocious roars echoing from the abyss with countless crimson and black aura. There was even a skeleton waiting for him above the abyss.

Lin Yun’s face paled as he sensed the evil skeleton. Fear loomed over his heart as he quickly headed for the clouds.

However, the skeleton was too fast and it appeared behind him in one second. But despite facing death, Lin Yun maintained his composure and faced the demonic skull head-on.

Just when he was about to be devoured by the demonic aura, Lin Yun landed on the cloud where his origin energy and sword intent were unsealed.

“Die!” Lin Yun flicked his finger without any hesitation and unleashed a powerful sword ray from his while three layers of flowers appeared behind him. In the sea of flowers, his outstanding temperament made him look like he was crafted from jade.

When the Divine Flicking Finger instantly pierced through the skull, Lin Yun’s face turned pale. He was so close to death.

“What the hell is this?” Lin Yun muttered with his brows locked.

“Demonic will. Regardless of righteous or demonic cultivators, they will produce will upon their death and will be demonified if the area isn’t cleansed for a long time. What you just encountered is an ordinary demonic will,” said Lil’ Purple. When Lin Yun turned around, he noticed that she had already come out of the sword box.

“Haha! Looks like the Heavenly Slaughtering Empress is pretty worried about me?” Lin Yun chuckled.

“Hmph! I’m only out here to take in some fresh air.” Lil’ Purple turned her head around and pouted, “And you have to recite my entire title to make it sound more intimidating. I’m the Divine Phoenix Clan’s…”

But Lin Yun had interrupted her before she could finish, “Lil’ Purple, look what’s that!”

Seeing that Lin Yun had interrupted her again, Lil’ Purple snorted, “Why should I look just because of your words? Dream on! I won’t listen to you!”

“Holy shit, what’s that! It’s really a mountain! Lin Yun, you were right!” Lil’ Purple still turned her head around and exclaimed with excitement on her face. She could see an azure mountain in the boundless sea of clouds with a starry sky behind it.

With pride flashing in his pupils, Lin Yun smiled, “Didn’t I say I’m a peerless genius in the sword dao.”

“Hmph! I won’t believe you. Didn’t you say earlier that you weren’t afraid of death? Then why did your face become pale earlier? I can even hear your heart beating violently still,” said Lil’ Purple in a disdainful tone.

“Well, you won’t understand the hot-blooded nature of young people,” smiled Lin Yun.

“What did you say?!” Lil’ Purple’s face turned red. How could she accept LIn Yun calling her old?

“Hahaha, I said nothing.” Lin Yun laughed before he dashed forward. This made Lil’ Purple sigh before she chased after him. Just like that, the two of them laughed while they headed toward the mountain.

But Lin Yun stopped when he was about to approach the mountain. The mountain wasn’t that large from afar, but now that he was close, it was extremely massive.

“Lin Yun, what did you say about me earlier?” Lil’ Purple glared at Lin Yun furiously. She still hadn’t forgotten about Lin Yun calling her old. If Lin Yun couldn’t give her an appropriate explanation, there was no way she would let this matter rest.

Lin Yun squinted his eyes and turned around to look at Lil’ Purple before he smiled, “I realized that you have a pair of beautiful eyes that look like two shining stars in the sky.”

Although Lil’ Purple was flattered by those words, she still wore a disdainful smile, “Of course I do!”

“Right, you’re of the Divine Phoenix Clan. Let’s go.” Lin Yun smiled.

Just like that, the two of them walked in the boundless sea of clouds like two immortals. The emerald stars in the sky were gorgeous. But as Lil’ Purple walked, she locked her brows together because she remembered what Lin Yun said about her. Realizing that, she spoke out unhappily, “Stupid Lin Yun, didn’t you say anything about me earlier? I seem to recall you thinking I was old…”

“What? Look how high the mountain is!” Lin Yun smiled.

“Hmph, I could have destroyed that with a flick of my finger when I was at full strength.” Lil’ Purple said with disdain.

Lin Yun merely smiled and landed on the azure mountain. When he got to the peak, a stone statue was waiting next to a wall. Looking at the wall riddled with sword marks, Lin Yun heard a sword hum echo in his ears.

“I’m here for the test,” said Lin Yun.

“There’s a painting on the wall, and you’ll pass if you can defeat it,” replied the stone statue.

Lin Yun didn’t waste time and began to examine the wall. The wall was clearly different from the previous ones, and the sword intent was a lot stronger. Pushing his sky sword intent to the limit, his hair began to flutter as his gaze became serious.

About an hour later, Lil’ Purple suddenly spoke up, “Lin Yun, your eyes are bleeding.”

Blood was flowing down from Lin Yun’s eyes, but he didn’t care. He continued to look at the wall in search of the painting. Suddenly, he smiled and a painting appeared before his eyes. When the painting unfolded, a figure charged at Lin Yun.

Without any hesitation, Lin Yun drew his sword and charged forward. Just like that, he began to clash with the figure from the painting. It was a brutal battle that forced Lin Yun to bring out the Iris Sword Array. Even then, he barely won the fight.

When he was done, a beam of light shot into Lin Yun’s mind from the painting. It was the 11th sword of the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords, called the Emerald Stars.

Opening his eyes, Lin Yun wiped the blood off his lips and smiled, “I knew it.”

“The verse! Memorize it quickly!” Lil’ Purple urged Lin Yun to be proactive when she saw him smiling.

“Got it.” Lin Yun smiled and sat down as he memorized the verse on the wall. After he got up, the stone statue spoke, “You’ve passed this test!”
