Chapter 1846 - My Sword, Shine For Eternity!

Lin Yun jumped into the pool under the nervous gazes of Gu Jun, An Liuyan, and Mei Zihua. A long time later, when Lin Yun reopened his eyes, he found himself in a world filled with primal chaos, where there was no heaven or earth. He was just floating in this empty world, looking around as he murmured, “This is the Thunder Secret Realm? It’s a primitive secret realm fully constructed with lightning…”

As his vision slowly returned to him and his physique adapted to this space, Lin Yun soon calmed down. He had undergone nine tribulations, so he knew how dangerous it was. He also knew that he could only rely on himself to make it through the tribulation. Thus, he decided to take it slowly.

After calming down, Lin Yun first took out the Thundercloud Wine and Blue Luan Wine before taking a sip of each one. The moment the wine entered his mouth, they swiftly merged into his body. The dragon origin within Lin Yun’s body began to rumble, and his Thunderstorm Intent was rapidly rising. Most importantly, the liquid in the wine had fused into his body.

The entire process was smooth, and the alcohol aromas were ultimately converted to mental energy that entered his sword ocean. Under the nourishment of the alcohol aromas, his Azure Dragon Intent swiftly reached the pinnacle of the fifth grade.

“How powerful. If it’s someone else, their Thunderstorm Intent would probably immediately reach the fifth grade.” Lin Yun was inwardly shocked, since he still hadn’t drunk the Demigod Wind yet. Without any hesitation, he began to gulp down the two wines until he formed a resistance from them and could no longer have any improvements.

Wines were like saint elixirs, and the effects would diminish the more you consume them. With the help of the two wines, Lin Yun’s Thunderstorm Intent swiftly broke through the shackles of the fifth grade and reached the sixth.

Within the Kunlun Realm, there were many geniuses born with a saint physique. Their parents might be saints and their grandparent might be an emperor. Thus, this blessed them with extraordinary talents, and they could reach an unprecedented height at a young age.

But Lin Yun believed that he would catch up to them one day before shaking them behind him. He would become the unrivaled Sword God in the world. He wanted to reach the limit and forge his own path as a Sword God.

“Let’s give the Demigod Wine a try.” Lin Yun poured a cup of Demigod Wine for himself. This was a wine that no one could imagine, and he gulped it down just like that. Without any hesitation, he poured two more cups of Demigod Wine for himself and gulped them down.

When the Demigod Wine entered his body, it suddenly charged towards his soul. Lin Yun might be drinking the Demigod Wine, but his soul was slowly absorbing it. Then, it coursed throughout his body, it was a drastic difference from those top-tiered wines he drank.

Lin Yun nearly became drunk on the spot, but he relied on his powerful willpower and soul to resist it. His soul consciousness was under a bizarre realm, and Lin Yun could feel his body becoming light, as though his consciousness had left his physique.

As intoxication continued to sweep through his consciousness, he started to feel blurred and merged into this space. Under this state, he felt like he was the creator of the world, and he could even create the sun and moon with a single thought.

Lin Yun’s mind suddenly blew apart. When he opened his eyes, it felt as though a split second had passed or a hundred thousand years. His sword intent, physique, and cultivation rose to an unbelievable height.

His Heavenly Dome Sword Intent that had reached greater mastery took a further step and was infinitely close to complete mastery. The golden-purple and blue-jade dragon runes have reached a hundred and fifty thousand. His nine dragon pulses also grew to twenty-five thousand feet before he reached a limit. But Lin Yun could sense that he had yet to completely digest the Demigod Wine within his body.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

It had merged into his body, becoming his foundation in the Dragon Pulse Realm, awaiting him to reach the Samsara Edict Realm. Suddenly, a rumbling bolt of lightning appeared. It wasn’t dazzling, but the rumbling thunder echoed within the surroundings.

When Lin Yun raised his head, it felt as if the world had been excavated with silver radiance shining in the depths, containing a powerful aura.

“Is the final tribulation finally going to arrive?” Lin Yun looked at the sky. He should be feeling nervous, but he was surprisingly calm instead upon seeing it’s arrival. He could feel his heart pumping with a hint of anticipation on his face.

As primal chaos finally split apart, a dazzling brilliance shone, and Lin Yun squinted his pupils. He instantly recalled the Sword of the Beginning. Back then, when he created this sword, this was what he imagined, the first gleam of radiance in the universe. But he couldn’t comprehend or mimic the actual thing. Thus, he could only try and mimic his glory with his sword dao as a foundation.

He had yet to use this move for a long time because when it was first created, he wasn’t even at the Empyrean Realm. But it was still the sword technique he created, and it was deeply imprinted within his mind. While he was in deep thought, heaven and earth began to start rising and he found himself in a barren land.

That radiance suddenly froze before manifesting into a person. Basking in the powerful radiance, that person said, “Ruler of the Nirvana Dao, heir of the Firmament Saint Cloth… I can finally see you again.”

“Senior, you are?” Lin Yun tried to probe the identity of this person.

“You have seen me before.” That person replied.

Hearing that made Lin Yun fall into deep thoughts before his eyes lit up. He yelled, “You’re the Black Thunder Martial Emperor!”

“That’s right.” That person said, and began to look around before he continued, “I’m afraid this place won’t do well if you want to try and reach the limit of the Dragon Pulse Realm…”

“Why?” Lin Yun asked with his face changed.

“This secret realm was created by me for my descendants to undergo their tribulations, and the lightning here contains the aura of Black Tortoise. It has a chance of allowing one to obtain the Black Tortoise Saint Realm. But… it’s useless for you.” The Black Thunder Martial Emperor said.

“What does it have to do with the tribulation, then?” Lin Yun wasn’t too bothered because he already possessed two saint physiques, and he didn’t need another one.

“I am only a wisp of my remaining will left in the world, and this secret realm can’t exist for eternity. A hundred thousand years is too long. There is no longer a sufficient amount of black tortoise saint aura to support this space and connect it to the outside world.” The Black Thunder Martial Emperor said.

“This…” Lin Yun froze because wouldn’t that mean all of his effort would go down the drain? There was only one chance for him to reach the limit of the Dragon Pulse Realm, and Lin Yun wasn’t sure if he would get another chance.

“Senior, what do you mean by the ruler of Nirvana Dao earlier? I haven’t even touched the surface of it, not to mention grasping it…” Lin Yun changed the topic.

“Did I make a mistake, then?” The Black Thunder Martial Emperor had confusion on his face, but then said, “You’re too weak now, but you’ll reach that height sooner or later. You have practiced the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon. You’re the heir of the Iris Sword Saint. Since ancient times, only two people have grasped the Nirvana Dao, one is the Blue Dragon Divine Ancestor, who founded the Divine Dragon Era, and the other is the Iris Sword Saint, who was capable of slaying deities at the Saint Realm. You are the third… and I am right.”

After understanding the story behind it, Lin Yun no longer dwindled on that and sighed, “Senior, please send me out.”

But the radiance merely flicked and didn’t say a word. A long time later, the Black Thunder Martial Emperor said, “Perhaps you were brought here by fate, and perhaps helping the successor of Nirvana Dao is my fortune.”

“Do you know why the Iris Sword Saint didn’t join the battle in ancient times?” The Black Thunder Martial Emperor asked, just when Lin Yun was baffled by what he said.

“I do.” Lin Yun nodded. Jiang Ling was aggrieved when he talked about that.

“But he left some words behind. That person might not return, and the third ruler of Nirvana Dao will appear when crisis descends on the world once more.” The Black Thunder Martial Emperor continued.

Is that person referring to the Blue Dragon Divine Ancestor? Lil’ Purple mentioned that they all believed that person would return, but he was nowhere to be seen when the final battle took place. Although the Divine Dragon Era won, no one was sure if they truly won from the result.

“Who’s the enemy? Is it the Demonspirit Clan…?” Lin Yun asked.

“Yeah, but they’re not the only ones.” The Black Thunder Martial Emperor said in a disappointed tone. “You’re too weak now. So let me help you forge a foundation that can clear your path to the top of the pyramid!”

But before Lin Yun could reply, the Black Thunder Martial Emperor turned into light and disappeared into that smear of radiance. As lightning continued to appear, a thousand feet of lightning tore apart the horizon and space.

When the bolt of lightning fell on Lin Yun, Lin Yun was immediately sent flying away with his flesh ripped apart. The lightning that fell on him was like fine lightning serpents drilling into his wound before coursing throughout his body.

Lin Yun’s body trembled in fear because this was too terrifying, and it was more terrifying than all the tribulations he experienced together. The pain also made him scream out as he rolled on the ground.

In just an hour, hundreds of thunderbolts fell onto him. His flesh was ripped apart. His skin was torn, and his flesh was like mud as lightning coursed throughout his body.

“This is just the beginning. I’ll give you my last gift before dying. You will thank me when you make it through this whole ordeal. A person’s will is often stronger than their physique. Ruler of the Nirvana Dao, compared to the limit of the Dragon Pulse Realm, you should think about what kind of sword you want.” The Black Thunder Martial Emperor’s voice gradually became weak before his voice faded away. His last strand of consciousness disappeared, turning into the last tribulation of this secret realm for Lin Yun.

“What kind of sword do I want?” Lin Yun’s consciousness gradually faded under the pain, but the Black Thunder Martial Emperor’s words echoed within his body. When he reopened his eyes, Lin Yun already had an answer. He wants a sword that can pierce through the nine heavens. If he couldn’t return, then so be it. He wants a sword that will shine for eternity!
