Chapter 261 - The One Killing You Guys

“Sky Breaking Seal – Flying Dragon, Leaping Tiger!” Bu Chen ignored what Bai Qiushui said and made the Sky Breaking Seal. Empowered by the sea, the Flying Dragon, Leaping Tiger reached a new level. His right hand mimicked the dragon’s posture while strength accumulated in his left. He was waiting for an opportunity to unleash the lethal strike.

The two wandering cultivators standing beside the devil mask roared, “You dare to attack Big Brother? You’re simply courting death!”

The two made their move and blocked Bu Chen’s Flying Dragon, Leaping Tiger. Both parties retreated after the clash. Bu Chen’s face turned grave when he saw that his attacks only managed to make the two men retreat with some light injuries.

“Let’s move together! Brother Xiao and I will deal with the devil masked one. The rest will go after the other two!”

“Alright!”

Bu Chen and Xiao Ran boosted everyone’s morale when they took the lead to attack. The battle unfolded instantly and it was more brutal than anyone had imagined. The moment both sides clashed, a Gao Clan’s disciple was torn into pieces as blood splattering around. This scene stunned Bai Qiushui’s party because no one had ever witnessed such brutality.

“You guys dared to step into the Bloodbone Forest with that strength?” The skinnier wandering cultivator sneered and threw out a punch, splattering the head of some sect’s elite. With that, the elite, a cultivator in the fifth stage Profound Martial Realm, died before he could even do anything.

The two wandering cultivators were like wolves in the middle of a herd of sheep. Bai Qiushui looked at this scene with a grave expression because Bu Chen and Xiao Ran were too rash. They had no idea how terrifying wandering cultivators in the Bloodbone Forest were.

After all, it was impossible for there to be any weak wandering cultivators in the Bloodbone Forest when the law of the jungle was practiced here. Screams and yells began to sound out as the two wandering cultivators left behind death and casualties. In just ten-odd moves, almost everyone in the team had died.

On the other side of the battlefield, Bu Chen and Xiao Ran were facing the devil masked wandering cultivator without gaining an advantage. The devil masked wandering cultivator looked as if he was toying with them since he was casually defending against their attacks. He even took it as far as taking punches and swords with his flesh.

When Xiao Ran’s sword stabbed into the devil masked wandering cultivator’s chest, a rebound force exploded. Xiao Ran was blown away, spitting up a mouthful of blood before he could even rejoice about his attack. At that moment, he took a closer look at the devil masked wandering cultivator’s chest. He was shocked to realize that the devil masked wandering cultivator was actually wearing a defensive profound artifact.

“Quasi-cosmic armor!” Despair flickered in Xiao Ran’s eyes as he looked at the incomplete spiritual rune on the armor. It was a quasi-cosmic armor and it exceeded the ranks of profound artifacts.

“Damn it! His cultivation is higher than ours and he also actually has quasi-cosmic armor!” Bu Chen was flustered by this scene.

“Good weapons can only be fully utilized in the hands of powerhouses. Even if the two of you possessed cosmic artifacts, I could still crush you guys like ants,” said the devil masked wandering cultivator.

“What did you say?” yelled Bu Chen. He lost it when he heard those words.

“I’m saying that you two are garbage,” sneered the devil masked wandering cultivator.

“You’re courting death! Dragon Painting!” Bu Chen roared and started to make a painting of a dragon, using his arms as brushes. His aura also started to drastically change.

The devil masked wandering cultivator had a trace of shock in his eyes before he smiled, “You call that Dragon Painting?”

A cold light flashed in the devil masked wandering cultivator’s slender eyes and he threw out a punch that combined his origin energy and ominous aura. The Dragon Painting that Bu Chen was so proud of shattered instantly and his internal organs exploded. Bu Chen fell onto the ground, groaning in pain.

“Moonlight Flow – Thunderous Storm!” roared Xiao Ran. Moonlight started emitting from his body like the autumn moonlight and his sword flashed like a bolt of lightning.

“Blood Massacre!” The devil masked wandering cultivator snorted coldly and crimson light began to gather around him before exploding. The moonlight dissipated and Xiao Ran’s aura dropped before his attack even got close.

“Get lost,” said the devil masked wandering cultivator before kicking Xiao Ran back to Bu Chen.

Then, the devil masked wandering cultivator slowly walked towards them. His ominous aura pressed down on them like a mountain of corpses. Xiao Ran and Bu Chen were terrified and retreated since the shadow of death loomed near.

Seeing death slowly approaching, Bu Chen suddenly got down on his knees and begged, “Senior, please spare us. We’re both elites from the four great sects. Nothing good will come from killing us. It will only bring disaster upon you.”

His reaction made the other two wandering cultivators laugh. Even the Gao Clan and elites from the other sects were looking at him in disbelief. They never imagined that the prideful Bu Chen would actually get down on his knees to beg. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Haha! Four great sects’ elites? You have no idea how many of you we’ve killed. So, do you think that we’ll let you guys off?” The devil masked wandering cultivator laughed and removed his mask, revealing a sinister and pale face to everyone.

“Xue Feng! The Xue Feng who is 98th on the Great Thief Ranking!” Fear filled Xiao Ran’s eyes as he began to tremble.

“All of you kneel! Anyone who dares to resist will be killed!” roared Xue Feng.

Since they saw Bu Chen begging to be spared, they had no problems with falling on their knees as well. The skinny wandering cultivator looked at Bai Qiushui, who was gritting her teeth, and he said, “Big Brother, there’s still that lass over there. She looks pretty good!”

“Hehe! It’s rare for women to visit the Bloodbone Forest, not to mention a beauty of her level,” smiled the one-eyed wandering cultivator as he approached Bai Qiushui with the skinny cultivator.

Bu Chen and Xiao Ran were on their knees and they didn’t dare to move despite the countless thoughts going through their mind. They knew what would happen if Bai Qiushui fell into the hands of the wandering cultivators, but they didn’t dare to utter a single word at this moment.

“Bastard! Don’t you dare touch Lady Bai!” roared Gao Yu when he saw the two wandering cultivators approaching. He got back on his feet and charged towards the two of them.

“Get lost.” The wandering cultivator raised his hand and grabbed Gao Yu’s chest. If this claw were to hit, Gao Yu would die since he was already injured.

But just when the claw was about to hit, a wisp of violet sword gleam shot over. The skinny wandering cultivator was shocked and immediately pulled his hand back to avoid the sword gleam.

“Who the hell are you?!” questioned the one-eyed wandering cultivator.

“I’m the one who will be killing you guys!”
