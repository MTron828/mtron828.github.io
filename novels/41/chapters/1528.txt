Chapter 1529 - Emergence of the Rogue Cat!

When Lin Yun sheathed his sword, a sword vibration echoed, drawing everyone back to reality. They still couldn’t believe that the chief disciples of the five demonic sects died just like that. After all, the five demonic sects spent a lot of resources to nurture those chief disciples, but they were all killed by Lin Yun.

Lin Yun first killed Murong Chen before he claimed the lives of the four with another sword. Everything happened in the blink of an eye, and the seven demonic sects were still in shock. All the juniors could feel a chill run down their spines because Lin Yun was too terrifying in their eyes, and they wouldn’t have believed it if they didn’t witness it with their own eyes.

Lin Yun’s gaze was indifferent. He had already made up his mind when Qiu Qiong interfered in his battle with Murong Chen. Since Qiu Qiong wanted to take it further, he couldn’t be blamed for being ruthless. Everything happened too quickly.

There was enough time for the Samsara Edict Realm elders to react, but they were still shocked when Lin Yun killing Murong Chen. When they came to their senses, five chief disciples died before everyone’s eyes. When they recollected themselves, a torrential killing aura exploded and their demonic auras spread out.

The Samsara Edict Realm elders were furious with their gazes on Lin Yun. Qiu Qiong was the angriest amongst them, and he quickly moved against Lin Yun, “Die!”

After Qiu Qiong made the first move, the other Samsara Edict Realm elders made their moves. This was shocking, since all the Samsara Edict Realm elders made a move, aside from the Heavenly Astral Pavilion. Twenty-odd Samsara Edict Realm experts were making a move against an Elysium Core Realm junior. No one would believe this if they didn’t witness it themselves.

When the twenty-odd figures descended towards Lin Yun, their terrifying auras became enough to crush Lin Yun into pieces. But Lin Yun was calm as he took out a medal with a wave of his hand. The front of the medal had ‘Firmament,’ and the back had Lin Yun’s name engraved on it. This medal was given to him by the sect master, Mu Xuankong when he became the heaven-direct disciple.

In the next second, something bizarre occurred. The medal began to glow, and the radiance formed into a bright moon within the asteroid belt. The light enveloped Lin Yun, and a sword vibration echoed within this region, “Eight thousand years of reign with our halo enveloping ninety thousand miles. As long as the moon exists, the Sword Sect never dies!”

The twenty-odd Samsara Edict Realm elders threw mouthfuls of blood before they were sent flying away by the moonlight, especially Qiu Qiong. Since Qiu Qiong charged in first, he was the first to collide with the moonlight, which made him throw out three mouthfuls of blood.

“It’s rude not to reciprocate. Since you dare to harm the heaven-direct disciple of my Sword Sect, I have a sword to give as a gift in return!” A figure wielding a sword flew out from the moonlight. When a sword ray exploded, the radiance lit up the entire horizon, with every speck of dust glowing in gold under the bright light, looking like flames.

The dazzling sword ray made the twenty-odd Samsara Edict Realm elders bleed from their eyes. But when the sword ray descended, aside from those who were pinnacle Kings, all the other Samsara Edict Realm elders were reduced to ashes. After the sword ray, only seven Samsara Edict Realm experts were left trembling in fear.

“Sword Sect’s Sect Master, Mu Xuankong!”

“This brat actually has a medal that was personally given to him by Mu Xuankong!” Qiu Qiong was shocked as he bled from his eyes. He couldn’t believe that the sect master of the Sword Sect would pay such great importance to Lin Yun, nor that the medal he gave him would have a sword hidden within it.

If they weren’t strong enough, they would also be dead. When the moonlight dissipated, Lin Yun was utterly dumbfounded as he looked at the medal. The sect master clearly said that this medal could help him fend off the attacks of Samsara Edict Realm elders; he didn’t say anything about a sword being hidden within it.

When Lin Yun raised his head, he saw Qiu Qiong’s gaze staring at him with no intention of letting him go. Qiu Qiong gritted his teeth, “Capture him. I’ll personally dig out his dragon bone!”

He might be intimidated by Mu Xuankong’s sword, but there was no way he would let Lin Yun go just like that. Even if he were willing to let Lin Yun go, he would let him go after digging out the dragon bone.

Upon receiving his command, the Dragon Pulse Realm elders of the Netherworld Hall all charged out. They were stronger than Murong Chen, and everyone had condensed a lot of dragon origin. Practically in a split second, they surrounded Lin Yun, wanting to capture him alive.

“Brat, what else can you do after using that medal?” A Dragon Pulse Realm elder unfolded his crimson and silver wings before reaching out towards Lin Yun. His dragon origin was gathered on his palm, which instantly shattered Lin Yun’s sword aura.

Lin Yun was surprised by the power of dragon origin, but he didn’t have any panic on his face. When that person got close, he took out the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella from his interspatial bracelet. He first poured ten thousand dragon runes into it before he swung it.

When the umbrella came in contact with that person’s palm, that person’s dragon origin instantly collapsed under the ten thousand cauldrons of weight. When that elder grabbed onto the umbrella, his forehead was covered in sweat because the umbrella was simply too heavy.

The elder had disbelief in his eyes, and he could sense that he wouldn’t be able to last any longer. When Lin Yun poured another ten thousand dragon runes into the umbrella, he raised it before slamming it down at an even faster speed.

As the umbrella came in contact with that elder’s palm, that elder’s right hand began to shatter. Since the Blue Dragon Bone could keep producing dragon runes, Lin Yun could keep pouring them into the umbrella to increase its power. As the number of dragon runes in the umbrella rose, the umbrella's weight also increased from ten thousand cauldrons to thirty thousand cauldrons.

So when Lin Yun unleashed his attack, none of the Dragon Pulse Realm elders could take more than three strikes from him. Just like that, Lin Yun didn’t take long to create a bloody path in the siege of the Dragon Pulse Realm experts, and this scene made all the demonic sects’ disciples dumbfounded.

Seeing that Lin Yun was about to leave just like that, the remaining seven Samsara Edict Realm elders were dumbfounded at this scene. Their faces were ugly, but none dared to make a move, especially Qiu Qiong, who was so furious that he nearly threw out a mouthful of blood.

“Glory Saint Artifact! Why does he have a Glory Saint Artifact?!” Qiu Qiong’s face was nearly distorted as a ruthless light flashed across his pupils. But he suffered greatly from Mu Xuankong’s earlier sword and was no longer as arrogant as before.

“Lin Tian, you want to leave just like that?” An eerie voice came from the Heavenly Astral Pavilion’s direction. The voice came from Tian Jue, with the second and third envoys restraining An Liuyan beside him.

When Tian Jue gave An Liuyan a slap to her face, this instantly made An Liuyan’s cheek swell. Tian Jue then grabbed a hold of her hair. “It’s thanks to her that you can enter the Dragon Remnant Astral Realm, right?”

Lin Yun stopped moving when he saw this scene, and his face was terrifyingly dark while he tightened his grip on the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella.

“Interesting…” Qiu Qiong smiled. After all, it would be a little troublesome if Lin Yun left just like that. If he had a choice, he didn’t want to make a move against Lin Yun personally. Tian Jue really helped him this time.

“What do you want?” Lin Yun calmly asked while suppressing his rage.

“I want your death!” Tian Jue laughed. “But I know that you won’t provide that. So dig out the Blue Dragon Bone yourself, and I’ll let her off.”Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

A cold light flashed through Lin Yun’s pupils because he was extremely sensitive to those words. After all, he had his dragon bone dug out once in the past.

“What’s the matter? You can’t do it?” Tian Jue eerily smiled before he gave An Liuyan another slap. This slap was resounding, and this made Tian Jue feel great.

“You madman, let her go and come at me, if you dare!” Xiao Yun, also restrained, furiously roared with his body trembling.

But Tian Jue didn’t even bat an eye at Xiao Yun. He looked at Lin Yun and snickered, “What’s the matter? Can’t do it? Get lost if you can’t. She’s a woman, so why should you have to put her in your eyes?”

He knew very well what kind of person Lin Yun was and said those words to incite the latter even further. He had planned this for some time now, even before Lin Yun came out of the Dragon Remnant Astral Realm. An Liuyan’s attention was on Lin Yun all this time. So it was easy for him to take her down.

His action was shameless even in the eyes of demonic sects’ disciples, using a woman to threaten Lin Yun. Strictly speaking, they were still from the same sect.

Tian jue snickered, “Tsk, tsk, tsk. This woman will become my slave sooner or later, so I’m just teaching her in advance. Lin Tian, don’t pretend to be a good person if you can’t do it!”

An Liuyan’s face was swollen, and she couldn’t utter a word. But she had tears rolling down her cheeks as she shook her head, signaling Lin Yun to leave quickly.

“My name is Lin Yun, not Lin Tian. Lin Tian is a fake name that she gave me.” Lin Yun calmed down, and the killing intent in his pupils disappeared. But those who knew him well knew how furious he was right now.

“Cut the nonsense!” Tian Jue coldly said. “I don’t care what you’re called. I’m only concerned if you’re going to dig out your dragon bone! Get lost if you can’t. What’s the matter? Is it weird to see a man beating a woman? There are many more, and she has nothing to do with you.”

“As you wish!” Lin Yun suddenly thrust his fingers into his chest without any emotions on his face, with blood spilling out. This scene shocked everyone because no one expected Lin Yun would go this far for a woman.

Even Tian Jue was stumped, but he was briefly stunned before he laughed, “Hahaha! Lin Yun, you’re a real man. You’re the first person to gain my respect. So there are stupid people like you in this world. Come and hand the dragon bone over to me if you want me to let this woman go!”

“Big Brother Lin, run! Don’t believe him!” Xiao Yun yelled.

But Lin Yun disregarded his words and slowly walked over, blood spilling out from his chest. Just like that, he walked a bloody path with his blood. When he stood before Tian Jue, he had already dug out the dragon bone from his chest. The entire process was naturally painful, but Lin Yun didn’t even let out a groan.

“Very well! Hand over the dragon bone!” Tian Jue indifferently said.

“Release her.” Lin Yun replied.

“Easy!” Tian Jue clapped his hand, and the two envoys that restrained An Liuyan let her go before they stood behind Tian Jue.

When Lin Yun placed the dragon bone stained in his blood in Tian Jue’s hand, Tian Jue was already smiling with his eyes squinted. But when he grabbed it, he realized that Lin Yun was still holding onto it. He smiled, “Let go. This Blue Dragon Bone no longer belongs to you!”

“When did I say that I’ll give it to you?” Lin Yun suddenly said.

Tian Jue was briefly stunned before he snickered, “You already dug the dragon bone out. Do you think that you’re still my opponent now? Without the dragon bone, I can easily kill you if I want!”

But when he was done speaking, flames suddenly blazed on the dragon bone, making him let go of it.

Lin Yun naturally wouldn’t let Tian Jue go just like that. He slammed the dragon bone enveloped in flames at Tian Jue’s face, making Tian Jue throw out a mouthful of blood before flying away. But that wasn’t all, Lin Yun used the dragon bone like a bat and slammed it between Tian Jue’s legs.

As the sounds of nuts burst, Tian Jue’s face became pale, and he screamed. He grabbed onto his crotch and wailed out in pain and despair because they were thoroughly smashed.

Right then, a torrential killing intent exploded from Lin Yun as he thrust the dragon bone back into his chest. As flames blazed, he sat down with his eyes closed. Fortunately, the dragon bone hadn’t left his body for long. So it wasn’t troublesome for him to fuse with it again.

“Kill him! Don’t let him fuse with the dragon bone again!” Tian Jue screamed. The other envoys charged at Lin Yun without hesitation upon receiving his order. They knew Lin Yun was extremely weak now, and this was the best opportunity to take him down.

“Don’t move.” Lin Yun grabbed onto An Liuyan, who wanted to step forth and stand before Lin Yun.

A black figure suddenly flew out from the sword box, holding onto a staff. It was Lil’ Red, who had successfully reached the Dragon Pulse Realm. It then suddenly transformed into a gigantic dracoape with its pupils turning blood-gold, emitting a terrifying outburst of dragon aura.
