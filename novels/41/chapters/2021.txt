Chapter 2022 - Blood Crows

Lin Yun only used one sword to slay a silver-winged Blood Crow King, and this naturally shocked the other Blood Crow Kings because the demon had become stronger than before.

“You’re courting death!” The golden-winged Blood Crow King was furious. It had been watching Lin Yun and swung its claws when it saw Lin Yun drawing his sword. Before its claws landed on Lin Yun, a powerful impact clashed against Lin Yun’s chest, causing the dragon runes on his body to shatter.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Kill him!” The seven remaining silver-winged Blood Crow Kings came to their senses and charged forth. With that, the altar became enveloped by bloodlust.

While facing the surrounding attacks, Lin Yun’s sword intent was suppressed, and he couldn’t unleash it. This was why Lin Yun couldn’t fight all nine of them previously. His sword intent would be greatly restricted if they surrounded him. But it was different now. The Flower Burial Sword flew out from his hand, blocking the incoming attacks of the seven silver-winged Blood Crow Kings.

On the other hand, Lin Yun circulated his nirvana aura and pushed his hands forth. His nirvana aura fused with his Azure Dragon Intent, summoning thunderstorms while gathering lightning. When the thunderstorms gathered, they formed into a dazzling energy sphere that clashed with the golden-winged Blood Crow King’s claws.

The clash made the altar tremble, with cracks spreading on the ground. The golden-winged Blood Crow King was charred by the lightning, with lightning flickering on its body.

“How is this possible…?” The golden-winged Blood Crow King was shocked because Lin Yun held his front well.

“This Blood Crow King is really strong. It iss no wonder why it is comparable to Quasi-Saints. I’m fortunate that the Blood Crows aren’t proficient in martial techniques and saint aura.” Lin Yun didn’t obtain any benefits in their fight either. He quickly circulated the Blue Dragon Bone to dissolve the baleful energy that was left within his body.

“Set up the formation!” The golden-winged Blood Crow King roared. “Set up the formation and kill him!”

Four silver-winged Blood Crow Kings took several steps back and took their positions. When black beams shot out from them, the blood ocean down below began to boil as a powerful pressure suppressed Lin Yun.

A white pillar shot out from the golden-winged Blood Crow King, and all the radiance from the blood ocean gathered onto it. As its bones began to wriggle, it took a humanoid form like the Blood Crow Ancestor. But the surface of its body was covered in a golden bone frame with some Blood Crow’s traits left on its head.

“The Yin-Yang Bloodlust Array,” Lin Yun instantly recognized that this was the spiritual array that the Blood Crows couldn’t set up before.

“Demon, don’t even think of escaping, even if you’re strong!” The humanoid gold-winged Blood Crow King sensed its power and gave Lin Yun a sneer. He was confident that he could suppress Lin Yun.

Lin Yun circulated the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon, mobilizing his body's nirvana aura. As he clashed with the golden-winged Blood Crow King, neither of them held back, and each attack contained a powerful might.

“He must be forcibly holding his front!” After ten-odd movies, the golden-winged Blood Crow King’s face was ugly, but it still suppressed Lin Yun, waiting for him to be exhausted.

Right then, the golden-winged Blood Crow King sensed two different auras circulating within Lin Yun’s body, before the Heavenly Dragon, Divine Phoenix, and black flower petals flew out from his hand. But before he could understand what was going on, Lin Yun threw his punch forth.

This made the golden-winged Blood Crow King throw out a mouthful of blood with shock written on its face. This was because Lin Yun’s nirvana aura had suddenly multiplied by twofold.

Lin Yun exhaled, and the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron rose within his violet palace. When the golden-winged Blood Crow King was sent flying, Lin Yun poured his nirvana aura into his palm. A vortex of thunderstorms also appeared as the Black Tortoise Chains became activated and flew towards the golden-winged Blood Crow King.

On the other hand, the Flower Burial Sword held the seven Blood Crow Kings down. This gave Lin Yun an opportunity as the Black Tortoise Chains dug into the golden-winged Blood Crow King, and he even injected the sacred flames into the chains.

With a gentle tug, that Blood Crow King was dragged over and took a head-on attack from Lin Yun. The golden-winged Blood Crow King couldn’t respond in time and was blown into pieces under that attack. With a nick in the Yin-Yang Bloodlust Array, the pressure on Lin Yun was suddenly elevated.

“ARRRGGHHH!” The golden-winged Blood Crow King furiously screamed because Lin Yun was too cunning. The golden-wing Blood Crow King went insane and wanted to put his life on the line, “I’ll kill you, no matter what!”

“Sword!” Lin Yun waved his hand and summoned the Flower Burial Sword back before swinging it, unleashing the Sword of the Beginning’s first sword form—Light of the Beginning. The phenomenon it created looked like primal chaos being split apart, and it was the first gleam of light in the world.

The light only shone for a moment before it disappeared. Blood splashed shortly after as the golden-winged Blood Crow King’s head fell.

“What a fast sword!” Lin Yun was shocked by the power of his attack. Time and space cannot be seen and was illusory beneath nirvana, especially time. Only those who reached the Saint Realm could sense some changes in time. But the Nirvana Dao was stronger than the Space and Time Daos.

His attack was so fast that he couldn’t control, and he would take lives when he drew his sword. But this sword also had a huge flaw because it required a powerful sword intent to execute it. If the golden-winged Blood Crow King didn’t go insane, there was a high chance that it could protect itself. But if his attack failed to take his opponent's life, his sword aura would collapse and reveal a fatal flaw.

Light of the Beginning, Boundless of the Beginning, Glory of the Beginning, Eternity of the Beginning, Darkness of the Beginning, and Nirvana of the Beginning.

Just the first sword form was already so powerful. Lin Yun’s gaze flickered, and he began to ponder about the power of that sword. “If I rely on this sword form, I might be able to slay Quasi-Saints.”

The seven Blood Crow Kings were in deep shock as he became lost on deep thought. They still couldn’t process the death of the golden-winged Blood Crow King. When they came to their senses, Lin Yun dashed forth.

Right then, the altar began to violently tremble. This was because Lil' Red took the Ancient Dracoape form and charged over, facing the flock of Blood Crows, creating a hole in the altar. The tremors made the seven Blood Crow Kings stagger, and a flaw appeared in their attacks.

“Myriad Swords Unite!” Lin Yun dashed forth with his Flower Burial Sword, unleashing afterimages that formed a circle.

A wound appeared on the chest of the seven Blood Crow Kings, and the Astral Sword Intent in the attack began to destroy their bodies from the inside. As the Flower Burial Sword trembled, Lin Yun looked at the reflection in the mirror. The seven Blood Crow Kings were heavily injured and wanted to escape. But Lin Yun swung his sword down, “Die!”

He activated the two glory spirits within the Flower Burial Sword, and his sword intent gathered to form a pillar of light. When he swung his sword, the space before him was severed into two. Shortly after, the seven Blood Crows exploded.

Lin Yun shook his sword, flung the blood from his sword. Everything happened as though what happened earlier was unreal.

When Bai Qingyu raised her head, she saw Lin Yun, who stood on the damaged altar with a gentle blowing breeze. This left her dumbfounded, and she could feel her scalp becoming numb. The Stalewater Sword was also a Twospirit Glory Saint Artifact, but the Stalewater Sword was nothing in her hands. The huge difference naturally made her feel ashamed.

Bai Qingyu, where did you get the confidence to make trouble for Big Brother in the Heavenly Dao Sect? Lil’ Red shrunk back to its cat form as it began to clean up the battlefield. There was a golden bead and eight silver beads when it reappeared before Lin Yun. Lil’ Red chuckled, “Here, Big Brother.”

Lin Yun couldn’t help smiling when he saw this scene because Lil’ Red was still the same as before, always the fastest when cleaning up the battlefield.

Lin Yun was still amazed by the power of the Flower Burial Sword before stowing the beads. But he left the golden bead behind, which Lil’ Red grinned and kept it.

“Big Brother Ye, you can now attempt to reach the eighth transformation again.” Bai Qingyu rushed over. “I heard that Jin Xuanyi is strong, and those who have fought him before have died.”

“I have just failed, and I’m not in a hurry,” Lin Yun said after briefly pondering.

He didn’t have much time left and was afraid something would happen if he was late. He could tell that Wang Muyan wasn’t concerned about the life and death of Xin Yan, and this made him worried.

“Let’s go!” Lin Yun called out before they rushed to Six Holy City.
