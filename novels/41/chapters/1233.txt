Chapter 1234 - Behead!

The Azure Dragon Saint Art circulated by itself without Lin Yun’s control once more, with the azure dragon mark blazing on his heart.

“Let me take a look and see how much you can grow!” Lin Yun smiled. He no longer suppressed the Azure Dragon Saint Art and allowed it to circulate because he was also curious about it.

The first time it circulated by itself, it refined the Blood Flame Dragon Rune when he was unconscious and made his physique the same level as a hundred-rune saint artifact. At the same time, it had thoroughly transformed his aptitude. So Lin Yun was looking forward to seeing if he could undergo another transformation.

Sitting down, the Azure Dragon Saint Art finally exploded. As the golden-yellow aura poured into his body, the Azure Dragon Mark began to squirm in his heart. In the next second, 108 purple-golden dragon runes radiated brightly with wind and lightning.

As dragon roars echoed from within his body, Lin Yun could feel his blood boil. Then, golden light radiated from the surface of his skin and a hot temperature tempered his body. Lin Yun’s physique was like a weapon that was being forged.

Furthermore, everyone could tell that the light from the others wasn’t as bright as Lin Yun’s light. The golden-yellow aura was swiftly being refined by the Azure Dragon Saint Art while the others could only refine it by force with their sword sutras.

Not long after, Lin Yun had three dragons forming around him. The dragons were covered with scales and their eyes shined bright.

“Holy shit, what’s going on?” The Profound Azure Prefecture’s elders were completely dumbfounded by this scene. This was the first time they had seen such a situation. This made them wonder if Lin Yun was still a human to refine three divine dragon auras when he had just sat down.

“What are you panicking about? This is nothing,” said the prefectural lord despite the shock in his heart. Hearing that, the other elders no longer dared to utter a word. They were impressed by the prefectural lord’s composure.

Lin Yun took a deep breath and the scar on his face had already recovered. At this moment, he could clearly sense every single cell in his body cheering in excitement. The Azure Dragon Saint Art was greedily devouring the golden-yellow aura before refining it and turning it into a golden liquid that flowed through his meridians.

The sensation felt great, unlike the pain he had to suffer in the past whenever he tempered his physique. The harvest today was simply beyond his imagination and he had to suppress the joy in his heart to allow the Azure Dragon Saint Art to circulate.

Half an hour later, nine dragons coiled around Lin Yun and each of the dragons were emitting a noble aura. Sitting there, Lin Yun looked like an emperor who was emitting a wisp of monarch aura.

Hmmm? Lin Yun sensed the monarch aura, which was baffling. After all, his martial intent had no connection with the path of a monarch. It seemed like he needed to thank the Divine Dragon Empire.

“This feels great!” Jiang Lichen was the first to open his eyes with excitement flashing in his pupils. He could sense that his entire body was filled with power because he had refined a total of four wisps of divine dragon aura!

It would take at least two to three months for him to digest his harvest this time. He was confident that he could make a breakthrough in the Elysium Core Realm within half a year. Just thinking about it made him laugh.

But when he swept his gaze around, he saw Feng Zhang and Liu Qingyan, who had finished a long time ago. They were both looking in the same direction with their mouths wide open and an expression of disappointment. Jiang Lichen was curious because those two should be able to refine two wisps of divine dragon aura. It seemed like he still had a firm grip on the position of chief disciple.

With a smile, Jiang Lichen asked, “What are the two of you looking at?”

“See for yourself,” said Liu Qingyan.

Hearing that, Jiang Lichen merely smiled it off and turned to look in the direction that they were both pointing at. But in the next second, he was dazzled by the golden brilliance of thirteen dragons coiling around Lin Yun.

“Holy shit, why is it so dazzling!” Jiang Lichen was instantly stumped by the radiance and covered his eyes with both hands. When he tried to open his eyes, he was completely dumbfounded. His jaw also dropped when he saw 13 dragons around Lin Yun. He couldn’t figure out how Lin Yun managed to do it. Most importantly, Lin Yun wasn’t even at his limit!

He could no longer describe the shock in his heart. After all, it was tough for him to refine four wisps. However, Lin Yun managed to easily accomplish that and even reached an astounding number of 13!

It took a long time before Jiang Lichen could smile, “Junior Brother Yun is too terrifying. There’s no way I can compete with him. How many wisps of divine dragon aura did you guys refine?”

“Five,” said Feng Zhang and Liu Qingyan.

Hearing that made Jiang Lichen’s lips twitch awkwardly because that represented the limit one could refine in the Empyrean Realm.

“Senior Brother, what about you?” Liu Qingyan asked with his eyes squinted.

Wearing an awkward smile, Jiang Lichen replied, “Not bad, not bad.”

“What are you guys looking at?” A voice resounded as Ye Ziling walked over with eight dragons slowly dissipating behind her. Furthermore, the Radiant Snow Flowers in her pupils instantly captivated their attention.

It seems that her temperament had undergone a huge transformation after she unleashed the power of her bloodline. Her bewitching temperament now had a slight chill to it.

“This…” When Ye Ziling saw the dragons coiling around Lin Yun, her jaw also dropped. After a long pause, she asked “Isn’t this a little too insane?”

She had relied on her bloodline to surpass the limit of the Empyrean Realm, refining eight wisps of divine dragon aura. But Lin Yun was even more unreasonable.

Suddenly, Ye Ziling’s gaze soon locked onto the Azure Dragon Mark that was shining brightly on Lin Yun’s chest. It was the Blood Flame Dragon Rune, an original saint rune. This instantly made Ye Ziling realize that Lin Yun’s body-refining technique must have a huge origin.

After Lin Yun formed the 13 dragon, his refining speed slowed down but it still showed no signs of stopping.

“Junior Brother Lin won’t devour all the divine dragon aura here, right?” Feng Zhang suddenly asked something that seemed impossible.

“Junior Brother, you really know how to joke. How is that possible? If he really devours all the divine dragon aura, the Profound Azure Prefecture will probably flip over the entire Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect!”

But four hours later, the dragons around Lin Yun reached an exaggerated number of 18, and all the divine dragon aura in the surroundings had vanished, leaving behind only the glowing Divine Dragon Pagoda. Faintly, everyone could see a fine golden strand stretching out from the pagoda to the Azure Dragon Mark on Lin Yun’s chest.

The divine dragon aura had already been exhausted, and that golden strand was the origin dragon aura. This instantly made everyone’s faces change and even Ye Ziling had become anxious.

“Junior Brother Feng, you and your mouth! What should we do now!” Jiang Lichen’s face became ugly as he pondered how they should leave.

“I… I was just casually asking…” Feng Zhang was also having a headache. They could see that the light of the Divine Dragon Pagoda was gradually dimming and cracks had also appeared in this domain.

“Senior Sister, what should we do? Should we wake junior brother up?” Everyone turned to look at Ye Ziling.

“Leave him be. Don’t wake Lin Yun up as long as this domain doesn’t break. This is his fortune.” Ye Ziling was clearly a lot more composed compared to everyone. She knew that they couldn’t wake Lin Yun right now.

This is a rare opportunity, and Lin Yun’s body-refining technique was extremely compatible with the divine dragon aura. So this could be Lin Yun’s opportunity to reach a new height. But thinking about the Profound Azure Prefecture, Ye Ziling couldn’t help feeling heartache.

At this moment, everyone from the Profound Azure Prefecture outside the domain was panicking.

“Prefectural Lord, what should we do now? The Divine Dragon Pagoda is going to collapse!” The elders all looked at the prefectural lord with anxiety and fear on their faces.

Even the prefectural lord could no longer maintain his composure because he didn’t think that Lin Yun could devour all the divine dragon aura and wasn’t even going to let go of the origin dragon aura. If the Divine Dragon Pagoda really collapsed, he would bear the consequences of a crime that would result in a beheading!
