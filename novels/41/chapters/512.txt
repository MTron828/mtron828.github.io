Chapter 513 - Infernal Mountain and River Painting

Mo Ling didn’t see what happened previously because she just arrived a few seconds ago. She only saw Lin Yun holding onto Gu Teng’s wrist. So it made sense that she said those words. Lin Yun wanted to explain, but it looked like Mo Ling was on the verge of flaring up. He knew that she would think that he was trying to find an excuse if he tried to explain himself, which would cause her to attack him. So Lin Yun had to be cautious or else there would be a fight between him and Mo Ling.

“Senior Sister, you must be joking. Who dares to ignore your existence? I’m just playing with Junior Brother Gu Teng here, right?” Lin Yun smiled as he loosened his grip on Gu Teng’s wrist.

Gu Teng’s face was ugly. Who was Lin Yun to teach him a lesson? If Mo Ling hadn’t come, he would’ve already taught Lin Yun a lesson by now. But since Lin Yun already said those words, there was no way he could act against Lin Yun before Mo Ling. He smiled helplessly, “Senior Sister Mo, we were indeed playing around.”

“Good then. All of you sit down,” snorted Mo Ling coldly. Gu Teng’s face was ugly, but just when he was about to sit down, he saw Lin Yun sitting down on his mat.

“Sorry about that. This place is mine now,” smiled Lin Yun.

“Just you wait!” Gu Teng turned around, and looked for another mat. There was without a doubt that Lin Yun had won this battle, which left many inner disciples shocked. No one expected that a guest deacon would be so arrogant, completely disregarding Gu Teng. But everyone’s attention was soon attracted by Mo Ling. After all, it was rare for Mo Ling to give a lecture herself.

After everyone calmed down, Mo Ling spoke out, “I’ll be explaining the origin of spiritual runes. In primordial times, there was a saint who comprehended Heavenly Dao and created the mysterious dao runes. Dao runes were rumored to be powerful and just one of them could change heaven and earth. But it’s hard to practice dao runes and the talent you need is unimaginable. So it was hard for it to be passed down. So gradually, dao runes were lost. But a wise sage comprehended divine runes from dao runes. Divine runes were weaker than dao runes because they were more simplified. So divine runes were soon spread out.

“Then, a great war broke out that destroyed many divine runes’ inheritance. So you can barely find any divine runes now. But fortunately, in the ancient golden age, our predecessors comprehended spiritual runes that were easier to grasp. During that time, spiritual runes were developed to the pinnacle. Even when the golden age was destroyed, the legacy of spiritual runes were still left behind…”

Dao runes, divine runes, and spiritual runes. Lin Yun was familiar with spiritual runes and things began to clear up for him with Mo Ling’s explanation. He was gaining a deeper comprehension into spiritual runes.

“Spiritual runes are still commonly used today to refine artifacts, refine pellets, fight enemies, and create puppets. Spiritual runes contain the dao in the world and it’s not any weaker than martial cultivators. So much so that you can even kill someone above your cultivation,” said Mo Ling.

“That powerful?” muttered Lin Yun to himself. He could barely believe that spiritual runes weren’t any weaker than martial cultivation, but it was a little dramatic to say that you could kill someone above your cultivation. Although Lin Yun was muttering to himself, his words were heard by everyone present. With that, everyone turned to look at Lin Yun.

“Student Lin Yun, you seem to have some opinions about my words. Why don’t you give it a try and see if it’s powerful?” Mo Ling also looked at Lin Yun.

Lin Yun smiled bitterly at Mo Ling’s words. He didn’t mean it that way. It was just that he had his doubts. As for fighting Mo Ling, he still had some concerns. After all, Mo Ling was ranked in the top three among the core disciples and she even gasped a divine ability. Lin Yun wasn’t confident about defeating her.

But that wasn’t anything embarrassing. After all, they weren’t in the same cultivation and age. Additionally, their foundation was also different. But it would be embarrassing if he was taught a lesson by Mo Ling publicly.

“I don’t have any. Your words have allowed me to benefit greatly,” smiled Lin Yun.

Now that Mo Ling had no reason to act against Lin Yun, she rolled her eyes and continued, “I’m proficient in using spiritual runes to attack. So I’ll be talking about using spiritual runes to attack.”

Compared to refining artifacts, refining pellets, and creating spiritual arrays, using spiritual runes to attack was more tempting.

“Big Brother Lin, you seem to be afraid of Senior Sister Mo?” Bai Yi chuckled as she rarely saw Lin Yun so sunken.

“What the hell are you talking about,” laughed Lin Yun as he knocked on Bai Yi’s head, “Listen.”

Mo Ling was someone who grasped a divine ability and Lin Yun wasn’t a masochist. He knew when to be arrogant and when to keep his tail between his legs.

“There are many ways to attack with spiritual runes and the easiest way is to attack directly,” said Mo Ling as she flicked out her finger to create a spiritual rune. She unleashed a second grade fire spiritual rune, which was blazing hot the moment it appeared.

“If you’re proficient in them, you can even add your own thoughts to them. Like this for example,” said Mo Ling as her fingers began to change, creating several more fire spiritual runes that combined together. When the nine spiritual runes overlapped, they turned into a fire dragon that was ten feet in length. The dragon stood above everyone’s head as it released a blazing heat.

The power made many people tremble out of fear that the dragon would attack them. With that, the entire place plunged into a little chaos. The power of the spiritual runes also made Lin Yun’s face change because this dragon could heavily injure a lesser Yin stage cultivator. To think that it was something that Mo Ling had created so casually.

“Or this,” said Mo Ling as a beam shot out from her eyes. At the same time, she also released her powerful aura. When she began to form seals with her hands, dozens of spiritual runes were being created behind her.

For a split second, the sky turned dark and a wild gale blew strongly, making it hard for everyone to keep their eyes open. There were also flames that illuminated Mo Ling’s face. She was using spiritual runes of four different attributes, wind, fire, thunder, and cloud.

When Lin Yun saw the spiritual runes behind her clearly, he couldn’t hide his shock. Mo Ling was not simple and the aura she was giving off made everyone shocked. The strength she displayed showed everyone why she was standing on the stage.

Many people’s eyes lit up as they looked at Mo Ling with their gazes burning. Even Gu Teng clenched his fists together.

“Admirable,” muttered Lin Yun as he was convinced by Mo Ling’s strength. He could also create second grade spiritual runes, but he could only imprint them on pellets and not use them for battle. So what he saw today made him realize that he still had a long way to go.

“Senior Sister is powerful!”

“Holy shit! Senior Sister Mo really is the best!” The disciples began to cheer when the phenomenon began to disappear.

Mo Ling revealed a smile as it wasn’t easy getting everyone’s focus. When she looked at Lin Yun, she saw Lin Yun sit upright, more focused than anyone else. She instantly felt that Lin Yun was acting. She still couldn’t forget how arrogant Lin Yun was towards her three days ago. So she naturally didn’t believe that Lin Yun was here to listen seriously.

Retracting her gaze, Mo Ling spoke out, “These are just the basics. Other lecturers talk about them normally, so I won’t repeat it again. Today, I’m here to show you guys the true power of spiritualists, spiritual diagrams.”

Her words instantly gave everyone a grave expression while excitement filled their eyes. They were clearly interested in spiritual diagrams.

Spiritual diagrams? Lin Yun’s focus also became unprecedented as he looked at Mo Ling retrieving a painting out of her interspatial pouch. When Mo Ling unfolded it before everyone, the painting was painted with a sea of flames that seemed as if it could incinerate everything.

When Lin Yun saw the painting, his eyes lit up. He could tell that the spiritual runes had perfectly intertwined together without any flaws. The strongest spiritual rune in it was just a second grade spiritual jade. But the aura it was giving off could even injure a greater Yin stage expert.

This was similar to the painting he had where the tiger paw crushed the mountain, except that it was a lot stronger. But there was also a possibility that this was because Mo Ling had created this. After all, Lin Yun wasn’t even in the Violet Palace Realm when he grasped the painting and he was only a second grade spiritualist. On the other hand, Mo Ling was a pinnacle third grade spiritualist.

“Today, I’ll be teaching you guys how to draw the famous Infernal Mountain and River Painting of our academy,” said Mo Ling. “Someone doubted if spiritual runes could be used to kill previously. With spiritual runes, I once killed a Violet Palace Realm elite when I was only in the Profound Martial Realm. So learn well. If you guys can grasp the essence of this painting, you can also kill opponents stronger than you.”

The Heavenly Province Academy was famous for their spiritual runes in the Nether Prefecture. Their cultivation might be weaker than the other quasi-overlord forces, but Mo Ling’s words gave everyone encouragement.

“Don’t get distracted during my explanation. I’ll pick a few of you to draw them on the stage. If I’m not satisfied with them, I’ll be handing down punishments,” said Mo Ling with a smile as she glanced at Lin Yun.

This made Lin Yun smile bitterly because it seemed that Mo Ling was targeting him.
