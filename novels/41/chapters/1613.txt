Chapter 1614 - Sovereign Pagoda, Invulnerable to Evil

A domineering mental energy poured into Lin Yun’s sea of consciousness, Lin Yun suddenly lost control of his body, and a massive shadow slowly began to shatter his soul. The Silver-Eyed Demonspirit wore a mocking smile, and said, “Ha. You people from the Divine Dragon Era are just a bunch of lowlifes meant to be enslaved for eternity, and you want my Divine Blood Clan’s sword technique? What a fool!”

As he spoke, he grew increasingly excited as he poured more mental energy into Lin Yun’s sea of consciousness. He wanted to control Lin Yun’s body to undo the restriction on him. Thinking about it, Murong Ke began to laugh because his mental energy was deep in Lin Yun’s profound palace, and it wouldn’t take long before he gained control of Lin Yun’s body, “Haha! Come and be my slave for eternity!”

But something unexpected occurred when Murong Ke tried to erase Lin Yun from this world. Countless golden runes started intertwining within Lin Yun’s profound palace, and those runes were engraved with scriptures. Each scripture emitted an ancient and divine aura with the golden runes forming an ancient saint rune.

“Sovereign Pagoda, invulnerable to evil!” When the saint rune formed into a seven-layered pagoda, it emitted a majestic brilliance that instantly forced Murong Ke’s mental energy out.

As Murong Ke threw out a mouthful of blood, his pupils were filled with disbelief, “Pagoda light… How is this possible…? This is an extremely rare saint rune of the Buddhist cult, even in ancient times!”

Lin Yun’s eyes became clear, and mockery appeared on his face, “If I didn’t have any trump cards, why would I dare to get close to you? Demonspirits like you dare to claim to be of the god race? My Kunlun Realm never lost, and never will we lose, even in the future. As for you, die!”F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Executing the Earth Sword Form, seventy-two shadows appeared from his body, each swinging a sword to form an ancient ‘Earth’ word. As the surrounding gravity multiplied by nine times, Murong Ke was shocked to discover that he couldn’t even move his fingers.

“The Carefree 9 Swords? You’re the heir of the Southern Emperor?” Murong Ke’s facial expression was replaced by fear as a light shone from his vertical eye, destroying the surrounding gravity layer by layer.

But Lin Yun was long prepared, executing the Heaven Sword Form before pushing his palm out. As thirty-six layers of heaven pressed down, the demonic clouds in the sky were torn apart, and Murong Ke’s chest slowly caved in before it was pierced through.

When Murong Ke was sent flying, his retaliation also arrived. He shot a beam from his vertical eye towards Lin Yun. As the silver beam streaked through the air, Lin Yun crossed his hands before his chest, and a pair of golden wings unfolded behind him with the Golden Crow Divine Rune within them quickly activated.

The Golden Crow Wings enveloped Lin Yun. When the divine rune was activated, the saint runes engraved on each feather turned the Golden Crow Wings into a myriad rune saint artifact with a total of thirty thousand saint runes.

When the silver beam came in contact with the Golden Crow Wings, it released a dazzling radiance that enveloped the surrounding ten-odd miles. Wisps of black miasma rose from the spot where the silver beam struck the wings. The silver beam itself contained terrifying corrosive energy. If Lin Yun took this attack head-on with his body, there was no way he could resist the corrosive poison.

As Lin Yun let out a roar, the Golden Crow Wings opened up, raising a violent gale that swept away all the rocks on the ground, and the heatwave contained in the gale forced the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit to take a few steps back.

“Kill him!” The Silver-Eyed Demonspirit barely regained his footing as he charged at Lin Yun.

But Lin Yun formed a seal and flapped the Golden Crow Wings, unleashing the Golden Crow Sacred Flames. Ten-odd demonic corpses ignited when they came in contact with the flames. As their demonic auras were swiftly being dispelled, it didn’t take long for them to turn to ash.

Even after the demonic corpses turned to ashes, the flames continued to burn, and the golden flames looked sacred as chants of the reincarnation scripture were being heard. As a sacred light enveloped this entire region, the demonic aura was swiftly dispelled, and Lin Yun looked like a sun emitting intense pressure.

“You bastard! I don’t believe that I can’t control you!” Murong Ke wielded the Nether Saint Sword. Using it with demonic aura, the Nether Saint Sword emitted wisps of terrifying sovereign aura. This was a damaged Sovereign Saint Artifact, but the power wasn’t something that just anyone could withstand when it was forcibly used.

Murong Ke charged over. He had gone insane and wanted to swiftly get rid of Lin Yun. With Lin Yun’s strength, even if he used the Flower Burial Sword, he wouldn’t be able to withstand the power of a Sovereign Saint Artifact, just like Chen Tao, Xuan Feng, and Xiao Kui. After all, the three were powerful with their Glory Saint Artifacts, but they were nothing before the Nether Saint Sword.

But Lin Yun was lucky because he cultivated the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra and could withstand the Nether Saint Sword since they were of similar origins. After all, Lin Yun wouldn’t have stood out if the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra had been useless.

“Looks like I can’t underestimate this fellow…” Lin Yun pondered as he fended off Murong Ke’s attacks. Fortunately, he tricked the latter once, or he might be dead now.

“Die!” Murong Ke flew over and swung his sword down. His sword was fast, and not even Lin Yun’s Heavenly Dome Sword Intent could warn him in time. But just when the Nether Saint Sword was about to land, it suddenly paused in mid-air.

“Mhm?” This made Lin Yun puzzled, but he quickly avoided that attack. When that attack continued to descend, it only managed to destroy Lin Yun’s afterimage. This repeated a few times where the Nether Saint Sword would briefly pause in mid-air whenever it was about to hit him.

Murong Ke and Lin Yun soon discovered something wasn’t right and the former retreated a few steps with a killing aura in his pupils. As wisps of silver demonic light emitted from his hand, it was like blood trying to fuse with the Nether Saint Sword.

“Ha. I admire your courage. You had many chances to escape, but you remained before me.” Murong Ke looked at Lin Yun.

“You’re only a remnant will, so you’ll die sooner or later as long as you can’t break the restriction. So why do I have to be afraid of you?” Lin Yun replied.

“I might be a remnant will, but it’s more than enough for me to kill an ant like you!” Murong Ke said as the silver light from his hand finally fused with the sword and he charged over. He was fast and left behind an afterimage when he dashed forth.

“Sword!” Lin Yun didn’t dare to belittle this attack, and his hand reached out. As he circulated the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra, the Netherflower within his body opened up, revealing the Nether Sword.

When Murong Ke appeared before Lin Yun, wanting to cut him into two, Murong Ke was shocked to discover that the Nether Saint Sword in his hand flew towards Lin Yun’s right hand.

When Lin Yun held onto the Nether Saint Sword, he could sense a massive amount of nether energy pouring into his body, and the Nether Saint Sword shone even brighter. With a ruthless light flashing within Lin Yun’s pupils, he swung the sword, “Die!”

Sovereign Artifacts were invincible beneath Divine Artifacts. He easily sliced Murong Ke into two. Everything happened in the blink of an eye, and it looked as though Murong Ke charged over to be cut into half by Lin Yun.

Wielding the Nether Saint Sword, Lin Yun fell onto one knee and breathed out. He felt exhausted with the world spinning and had exhausted most of his dragon origin. As for the nether energy within his body, there wasn’t a wisp remaining.

The Nether Saint Sword immediately became dim in his hand because the last attack had exhausted all the saint aura that was left within the sword. When Lin Yun observed the sword, fine cracks began to appear, which made Lin Yun quickly let go of the sword. This was because the effects of his ‘broken sword’ physique were still around.

Even if the ominous beasts had become constellations, his ‘broken sword’ physique was still around. It was just that the Nether Saint Sword’s grade was too high. This was why it could last for so long. But now that its saint aura had been exhausted, it could no longer withstand his grasp.

Murong Ke’s corpse turned to ashes, revealing a jade. The jade had ‘Nether’ engraved on it, filled with pure nether energy. Looking at it, Lin Yun briefly hesitated before grabbing it and turning it over to see that it was imprinted with Nether Shackle.

He instantly figured out that this must be the item that Jian Qingkong used to seal Murong Ke. If it wasn’t for this seal, this Silver-Eyed Demonspirit would definitely come back to life.

“I can’t stay here for too long.” Lin Yun took a pellet and briefly rested before swiftly leaving this place with the Nether Saint Sword.

The moment he had left, Xuan Feng, Chen Tao, and Xiao Kui arrived. When they looked at the surroundings, they were incredibly shocked.

“The Silver-Eyed Demonspirit is dead…”

“They all turned to ashes? How is this possible?!”

“Lin Yun is gone!”

“The Sovereign Saint Sword is also gone!” The three exchanged a gaze, and their faces changed when they thought of a possibility.

“That direction! He hasn’t gone far!” Chen Tao said before activating his Glazed Treasure Physique with his pupils shining brightly. He could see a golden figure a hundred miles away.

“That fellow is actually still alive?”

“Chase after him!” The three didn’t hesitate to chase after Lin Yun.
