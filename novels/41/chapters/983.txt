Chapter 984 - Saint Cultivation Technique

Lin Yun’s voice wasn’t particularly loud, but his words were clear. He was basically telling Mu Xiuhan to get lost. As if he dropped a rock in a pond, his words created a rippled effect of shock.

He instantly drew everyone’s attention, especially Yu Haotian’s attention. Lin Yun was more arrogant towards Mu Xiuhan than Yu Haotian would have imagined. Then again, it would be great if he could use Mu Xiuhan to probe Lin Yun’s strength. In fact, it would be even better if Mu Xiuhan could kill Lin Yun for him. At this point, he didn’t care who killed Lin Yun as long as Lin Yun died.

“Lin Yun, don’t push it!” Feng Xuanyi, Zhao Qi, and Chen Hao stood behind Lin Yun with displeasure on their faces. When Mu Xiuhan looked at Lin Yun, his expression became sinister. It was one thing that Luo Chen competed with him, but it was another when someone like Lin Yun wanted to compete with him? “Lin Yun, you better leave the stage or else you won’t be able to bear the consequences!”

While watching, Feng Xuanyi, Zhao Qi, and Chen Hao also looked at Lin Yun with killing intent. When Mu Xiuhan finished speaking, the atmosphere in the plaza became cold. Countless eyes were waiting for Lin Yun to make a move.

They were also shocked that four of the seven heads would gang up on Lin Yun. Facing this formation, even someone like Luo Chen would have to retreat. But everyone could tell that Lin Yun had no intention of leaving.

Even Luo Chen, Qin Lin, Pei Xue, and Jun Mengchen were surprised. They couldn’t understand why Lin Yun was so determined. They knew that Lin Yun wouldn’t be able to face four of the seven heads by himself.

Lin Yun was surprised that the four would gang up on him, but he didn’t let this bother him. He already knew something like this would happen when he decided to compete for the heart stage. So what if they were the seven heads? They would end up being nobodies the moment he killed them.

“Like I said, this place is taken.” Lin Yun calmly repeated his words.

“I’ve been saying it for a while now. There’s no need to be courteous to this brat. Lin Yun, let’s resolve our grudge today.” Feng Xuanyi sneered the moment Lin Yun spoke as he unleashed boundless flames from his body. At the same time, Zhao Qi and Chen Hao also unleashed their auras to prepare their attack.

All three of them had their names on the Heavenly Path Mirror and were qualified to make it to the end of the Heavenly Path. Clearly, they were strong. At the very least, they were at the top of the Azure Dragon Region.

When they released their aura, the entire plaza began to tremble. It was difficult for everyone else to resist the immense pressure.

But Lin Yun didn’t move and neither did Lil’ Red. In fact, Lil’ Red took the Heavenly Demonic Dipper Staff out of its pouch and stood in front of Lin Yun. With a roar similar to an Ancient Dracoape, its crimson aura exploded. At the same time, a massive dracoape appeared behind Lin Yun.

Then, Lil’ Red charged with the Heavenly Demonic Dipper Staff and smashed it against Feng Xuanyi. Under the Heavenly Demonic Dipper Staff, Feng Xuanyi was sent flying.

“Feng Xuanyi, it looks like you didn’t make any improvements even though a few days have passed,” mocked Lin Yun. At this moment, no one could believe that Lin Yun’s pet was strong enough to send Feng Xuanyi flying. Even Chen Hao and Zhao Qi were shocked as they didn’t dare to make a move carelessly.

“You’re courting death!” Feng Xuanyi roared as he unleashed his flame intent in its entirety. The radiance from the flame enveloped him in gold like a bright sun as he charged at Lin Yun.

Looking at Feng Xuanyi, Lil’ Red snickered. Lil’ Red wasn’t the same as ten days ago. After refining the Divine Firebird’s beast core and bloodline, its strength transformed and bloodline became denser. Most importantly, Yue Weiwei gave Lil’ Red a saint cultivation technique.

The cultivation technique allowed Lil’ Red to wield the Heavenly Demonic Dipper Staff a lot easier than before. With its improved strength, it wouldn’t be that easy for Feng Xuanyi to avoid his attack again. As origin energy and sparks flew about, Lil’ Red clashed with Feng Xuanyi once more and sent powerful shockwaves into the surroundings.

The stalemate lasted for a brief moment before Lil’ Red’s staff broke the majestic sun apart. Then, the staff landed on Feng Xuanyi’s head, causing his face to turn pale. Once again, Feng Xuanyi lost. In everyone’s eyes, Lil’ Red was more terrifying than a demon.

“The Demon Clan’s saint cultivation technique!” Pei Xue was surprised as her gaze was fixed on Lil' Red.

“The Demon Clan’s saint cultivation technique? How is that possible? How can a pet cultivate the Demon Clan’s saint cultivation technique?!” More people began to exclaim because a saint cultivation technique from the Demon Clan could only be found in the Kunlun Realm. Most importantly, it was even higher than a fortune technique. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Hmmm, it doesn’t seem to be complete…”

“Even if it’s an incomplete cultivation technique, it’s surprising for it to appear on a pet.” Many people’s eyes flashed because Lin Yun’s pet was already so terrifying. Clearly, Lin Yun had come prepared. Now, everyone began to wonder how strong Lin Yun was. Was he in a sticky situation or could he face Mu Xiuhan, Feng Xuanyi, Zhao Qi, and Chen Hao.

“Like I said, this stage is taken. I don’t want to repeat myself too many times. Since I dare to stand here, I naturally have my source of confidence. Don’t bother probing my strength because I don’t have a good temper,” said Lin Yun. There was no change to his words, but everyone could sense the chill and killing intent in his tone.
