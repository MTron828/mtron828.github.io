Chapter 441 - In the Name of my Sword, Bloom!

Lord Thirteen and the plump old man’s faces gradually became grave. A brief moment later, the plump old man smiled, “That brat just can’t settle down. It looks like you won’t have a chance to give out the Fish-Dragon Pearl…”

“Leave it all to fate. He should know the consequences since he made his choice,” said Lord Thirteen. With their cultivation, they had already sensed to violent energy fluctuation in the Sword Burial Diagram. The fluctuation was ten times stronger than normal and even the two old men wouldn’t dare to underestimate it despite their cultivation.

Without a doubt, Lin Yun was at the crucial moment of making a breakthrough and the platform he was on was enveloped with all sorts of phenomena caused by sword intent. If someone looked at the platform from afar, the platform would look like a dazzling sun.

It was all because Lin Yun was about to finish refining the beast core that he swallowed. At this moment, the core was the size of his nail and was emitting a dazzling light. In the end, Lin Yun had underestimated the power contained in this beast core. This beast core belonged to a Violet Palace Realm demonic beast that Lord Thirteen groomed for ten years. So this meant that the origin energy was extremely refined.

The thunderclouds continued to tumble in the sky while the sword intent brewed within the clouds and emitted a terrifying aura. Aside from the tumbling violent energy, the entire world was quiet. When the pressure spread out in the tiny world, Lin Yun’s face became grave.

He had a feeling that if he couldn’t make a breakthrough in his cultivation technique, he would be reduced to ashes. With the radiance enveloping Lin Yun, his expression became grave as he frantically tried to refine the beast core. He knew that the beast core was his only chance.

Suddenly, the Iris Flower began to emit a violent sword intent from its petals and devoured the beast core. It felt as though the Iris Flower had a consciousness of its own and it had also sensed the incoming danger. Within the flower, the beast core was swiftly being refined.

When the sword intent in the sky started to tumble around violently, the suffocating pressure got even heavier. Meanwhile, Lin Yun was anxiously waiting for the beast core to be refined.

When the last bit of the beast core was completely devoured by the Iris Flower, Lin Yun could sense his meridians lighting up as they gathered towards the Iris Flower.

When all the radiance was gathered in the Iris Flower, Lin Yun saw the Iris Flower breaking apart before coming back together again. It didn’t take long for an entirely new Iris Flower to be formed. The new Iris Flower was like a violet crystal and it looked more detailed than before. In addition to that, there was also a tiny crimson rune at the center of the flower that made the flower look alive.

Lin Yun’s mind was blown because he couldn’t describe the sensation he felt after seeing the flower. If he had to find a word to describe it, he could only say that it was bewitching. It was bewitching and noble, like the king of all flowers looking down on all others.

When the petals bloomed entirely, an ancient voice shuttled through the ages of time and resonated in his mind. A purple-clothed old man appeared in his mind. When the old man appeared, he swiped the body of his sword with his fingers and he stabbed out, “In the name of my sword, bloom!”

A mysterious sword seal bloomed from the old man. A terrifying sword intent was emitting from the old man along with a gigantic Iris Flower that manifested behind him. The Iris Flower then slanted forward and bloomed in the direction of the sky.

In the next second, a terrifying vortex was created. It felt as if everything in this world was being sucked into the flower and the demonic being that was charging at the old man disappeared.

Lin Yun was shocked by this scene and he was filled with emotions in his heart. He figured that this purple-clothed old man was the Iris Sword Saint.

When the old man’s image appeared within his mind, he suddenly gained enlightenment. What the old man used was the Dazzling Moment, which Lin Yun had already grasped. But the Dazzling Moment would drain all his origin energy the moment he used it. So he could only use it as his ultimate move. This meant that the move was a gamble, either his opponent dies or he dies.

Lin Yun constantly pondered the mysterious sword seal that the Iris Sword Saint used. Suddenly, a purple radiance bloomed from Lin Yun’s body on the platform.

Right at this moment, a bloodthirsty roar suddenly appeared within this world. When the thunderclouds continued to tumble, they slowly formed a crimson figure that looked like a demon. Then, the demon slashed down at Lin Yun’s platform.

In front of the demonic being’s sword, everything was being destroyed. Even the platforms that were here for thousands of years were like paper in front of the sword.

When Lin Yun opened his eyes to see this scene, his face changed. The crimson being was like a mountain, while he was just a small raft in the middle of the ocean.

“Damn it!” Lin Yun didn’t have the luxury of time to think about a solution and summoned his Flower Burial Sword. But for some reason, his heart finally calmed down when he held onto the Flower Burial Sword. Old friend, I’m counting on you again…

He had undergone too much with his sword and his heart was already linked with it. Even without him uttering a word, the sword released a buzz that resonated with Lin Yun’s feelings.

A smile rose on his lips briefly before it was replaced with the courage to face death. I, Lin Yun, won’t be dying here!

Just when the crimson sword was about to reach him, Lin Yun swiped his fingers on his sword. At the same time, the Iris Flower in his dantian bloomed and emitted an unparalleled sword aura.

“In the name of my sword, bloom!” When the Iris Flower bloomed, a bizarre scene took place. Lin Yun actually managed to block the demonic being’s sword, but his face turned pale and blood seeped out from the corner of his lips. Cracks also began to spread out on the platform.

“Get lost!” roared Lin Yun. Taking advantage of this moment, Lin Yun bolted out to dodge the attack. With that, the crimson sword no longer had anything stopping it and stabbed into the ground.

Lin Yun managed to land on another platform. He was kneeling and gasping for breath. His state was terrible with his hair scattered and blood oozing out from his nose, eyes, and ears. He was barely able to take that sword, but even so, his injuries were pretty heavy. However, there was a smile on his lips because he knew that he had survived that attack.

Back in the Sword Burial Woods, the two old men were briefly shocked. After a long while later, Lord Thirteen stroked his beard with a smile, “How lucky.”

Taking a sip of the Coldpool Dew, the plump old man smiled, “Yeah. He practically snatched his life back from the heavens. The Sword Burial Diagram is filled with bones, but he actually managed to survive.”

The pot was filled with Snowdragon Carp’s meat. The two old men already ate one-third of the meat, but neither of them touched the crescent moon meat that contained the essence of the Snowdragon Carp. The two were looking at each other and would strike each other’s chopsticks if either of them dared to touch it. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Not far away, the Dragon Blooded Horse laid on the ground looking at the pot pitifully with its drool all over the ground.

“You guys eating fish? Count me in…” Lin Yun was in a terrible state when he came out of the woods, but he wore a smile on his lips. This left the two old men surprised because they never expected Lin Yun exit so quickly. But before they could even react, Lin Yun picked up the crescent moon meat with his chopsticks and placed it in his mouth.

“That feels great. Lil’ Red, come and have some too.” Lin Yun’s eyes lit up when the crescent moon meat melted in his mouth. He had never tasted such a delicacy in his life and it even made his injuries feel much better.

When he raised his head and looked at the Dragon Blooded Horse looking at him with a pitiful gaze, he lifted the entire pot with a smile.

“Stop!” The two old men yelled while their faces turned dark. But they were already too late because the rest of the pot went into the Dragon Blooded Horse’s stomach.

When the Dragon Blooded Horse raised its head to look at the two old men, it started to chuckle and revealed its bucktooth.
