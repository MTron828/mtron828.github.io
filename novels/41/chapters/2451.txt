Chapter 2452 - Aid Radiant to become an Emperor!

Lin Yun’s group was stumped on the Scarlet Firmament Peak. They didn’t expect the Radiant Sword Saint’s tribulation would be Yu Qingfeng’s sword from three thousand years ago.

Yu Qingfeng donned a white robe with crimson radiance around him, looking indifferent. This was a manifestation of heavenly dao. In a nutshell, it was heavenly dao mimicking Yu Qingfeng. But that wasn’t the key; everyone was concerned if this sword was weaker or stronger than the one three thousand years ago.

Lin Yun and Ye Guhan didn’t know because the power of this sword had far exceeded their imagination. Even the Divine Phoenix Holy Master could feel his scalp going numb.

“Holy Master, can you withstand this sword?” Lin Yun asked anxiously, looking at the Divine Phoenix Holy Master, the strongest among them. When he asked that, the other Great Saints also turned to look at him.

The Divine Phoenix Holy Master’s lips trembled, and he asked, “How can I withstand this attack? I’m afraid that even the Emperor Realms from the other three holy lands couldn’t block it.”

As the oldest person around, the Azure Python Great Saint said, “I have witnessed that sword from Yu Qingfeng before.”

“How is it?” Ye Guhan quickly asked.

The Azure Python Great Saint said, “It’s not weaker than the sword three thousand years ago. But...”

“Are you sure that it’s not any weaker? But this is heavenly dao mimicking Yu Qingfeng, not Yu Qingfeng himself.”

The Golden Dragon King, Silver Dragon King, and other Emperors turned to look at the White Emperor. The White Emperor had the most authority here.

“Lord White Emperor, can the Radiant Sword Saint withstand it?” The Golden Dragon King asked, looking nervous with a grave expression. It was naturally best if the Radiant Sword Saint could die in this tribulation. After all, it was no longer possible to interrupt the tribulation, and they didn’t dare to intrude on that region even if they were Emperor Realm experts.

The White Emperor said calmly, “This mimic by the heavenly dao is not comparable to the real person, not to mention the Yu Qingfeng from three thousand years ago. Even so, it’s stronger than ordinary Emperor Realm experts.”

“It looks like the Radiant Sword Saint is dead for sure!” The Ming Cult’s Emperor said with a smile. The other Emperors also looked relaxed because that would save them the trouble.

But the White Emperor was calm and composed. What he said was right, but that was under one prerequisite; that was something the Radiant Sword Saint requested. After all, without that sword, the Radiant Sword Saint would’ve long reached the Emperor Realm. This meant that there was a variation in this matter.

The Heavenly Dao was ruthless, but that didn’t mean there was no chance. Otherwise, the heavenly dao would’ve killed the Radiant Sword Saint directly, and these emperors didn’t think about that. Not to mention that the Radiant Sword Saint didn’t spend three thousand years doing anything, and he was long undisputed the strongest beneath the Emperor Realm, and that title was much more acknowledged than Tian Xuanzi.

No one knew how powerful the Radiant Sword Saint had become. The last time he made a move was on the Heavenly Barren Battlefield, and he could easily beat up Tian Xuanzi even in his weakened state.

These people were afraid of this sword, but the Radiant Sword Saint might be happy and excited. What they feared was what someone yearned for with excitement. This was the difference between the mediocre and genius.

“Hahaha! Great!” When the Sword Sect was enveloped in pressure, the Radiant Sword Saint began laughing, looking at the descending sword. The sword that he had been waiting for three thousand years finally arrived.

As the Radiant Sword Saint began forming seals with his hands, the Sword Sect’s saint vein rushed into his body quickly. In just a brief moment, he had extracted half of the saint vein, and the aura he gave off also reached the pinnacle of Great Saint and was endlessly close to the Emperor Realm.

When the Radiant Sword Saint’s hands clasped together, the Heavenly Desolation Sword Intent swept out from him, merging with his saint aura, and broke through the shackles of the Emperor Realm. It was no weaker than some ordinary Emperors.

Under the sword aura, the sword rays descending from the sky began to slow down as two sword auras started to clash in the sky. The sword ray from the Radiant Sword Saint began to flash, causing heaven and earth to alternate between light and dark.

Lin Yun and the Great Saints were beneath the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron, and they could sense a powerful aura that made their faces grave. The phenomenon created by the Radiant Sword Saint spread to a million miles away, which looked like the arrival of an apocalypse.

The sword swung down by Yu Qingfeng paused briefly before it continued, slowly splitting the Radiant Sword Saint’s saint aura. Even the Sword Sect’s mountains around the Radiant Sword Saint manifested from time reversed began to tremble and were on the verge of collapsing.

Yu Qingfeng’s sword even gave a feeling that it wanted to split heaven and earth in half, and this sword seemed to be able to break free from heavenly dao’s control.

“This is ridiculous!” The Divine Phoenix Holy Master’s lips trembled, and his face turned pale. He grasped Time Dao, and he knew what this meant. This meant that Yu Qingfeng’s sword could suppress his Time Dao alone.

As for the other Great Saints, including the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint, they were deeply shocked as this sword had far exceeded their comprehension. This was because a Sovereign Dao had suppressed Eternal Daos.

But it wasn’t that ridiculous for Lin Yun. In his view, the power of this sword wasn’t that hard to comprehend, and he began to analyse this sword in his heart.

If I’m in the Emperor Realm or comparable to it, I can also unleash a sword comparable to this.

He was vastly different from Yu Qingfeng in cultivation, but their attainment in Sword Dao wasn’t that great. Back in the Azure Sky Realm, Lin Yun had already decided to wield Nirvana Dao through Sword Dao. Since he could do it, he believed that his master could do the same. Thinking about it, Lin Yun began to calm down.

When he first met the Radiant Sword Saint, his master taught him that his goal wasn’t to surpass him but the Nine Emperors.

The sword unleashed by Yu Qingfeng began to increase in speed and soon reached the Radiant Sword Saint’s head. This made everyone hold their breaths, and some didn’t dare to look at it.

The Radiant Sword Saint used his fingers as a sword and blocked that sword ray. With a massive impact, the scene of the Radiant Sword Saint being severed into two didn’t occur as he used his fingers as a sword to withstand the incoming sword ray.

That wasn’t only the case as the Radiant Sword Saint soared to the sky and pushed the sword ray back. The entire Ancient Barren Domain began to tremble as a sword ray spread out from him, spreading to the Sword Sect and the surroundings.

The sword ray reached a resonance with the surrounding mountains and rivers as they began to manifest with the Radiant Sword Saint in the center. This scene naturally shocked Lin Yun’s group.

Eight thousand years of reign with our halo enveloping ninety thousand miles!

The Radiant Sword Saint explained the meaning of the Sword Sect’s slogan with his actions because his sword ray enveloped ninety thousand miles. Furthermore, it wasn’t just one sword ray but numerous sword rays surrounding him.

“How is this possible?!” The Golden Dragon King jumped from his seat.

“I thought he hadn’t made it through his tribulation yet?” The Silver Dragon King frowned. He couldn’t comprehend how the Radiant Sword Saint caused such a commotion when he wasn’t in the Emperor Realm.

“As long as the moon exists, the Sword Sect never dies...” The White Emperor sighed. He had to admit that the Radiant Sword Saint was a genius in the way of the sword. But it was a pity that he ran into Yu Qingfeng and was suppressed for many years. But he was also lucky to meet Yu Qingfeng, which allowed him to surpass himself.

“Heaven and earth unite!” The Radiant Sword Saint roared as the sword rays around him began to move, which caused the entire Ancient Barren Domain to tremble. It seemed he could control the mountains and rivers as he wished, and Yu Qingfeng’s sword was knocked back.

“If I become an Emperor, the Sword Sect will return to become the leader of all swordsmen!” Shattering the attack, the surroundings froze at the majestic scene of the Sword Sect as a holy land, which overlapped with the Sword Sect in reality and looked unreal.

The next moment, the Radiant Sword Saint began to clash with the manifestation of Yu Qingfeng head-on with their swords. Everyone could hear the waves of laughter coming from the surroundings on the Scarlet Firmament Peak.

“This is the Sword Sect at the prime?” Mu Xuankong had tears streaming down his cheeks as this was the scene when the Sword Sect was the leader of all sword-related sects.

Taking a deep breath, the Radiant Sword Saint devoured the remaining saint vein with boundless radiance shining from him with the radiance of an Emperor gradually appearing. The sounds from the Sword Sect became even more apparent, as though everyone had come to life and were looking at the Radiant Sword Saint with their heads raised.

“Hahaha! I didn’t expect to see the Sword Sect three thousand years later. As long as the moon exists, the Sword Sect never dies!”

“Yu Qingfeng can’t break our backbone!”

“Even without the Grand Firmament Peak and Profound Firmament Peak, the Sword Sect can still return to the position as a holy land!”

“Fellow martial brothers, let us aid Radiant to become an Emperor!”

“Aid Radiant to become an Emperor!” A youth who looked like the chief disciple of the Sword Sect laughed, and his words drew resonation from the surroundings.

“Aid Radiant to become an Emperor!” Voices from three thousand years ago traveled through time and arrived in the present. Many Sword Sect’s students who hadn’t left wholly yelled along with those voices, including Lin Yun.

“Aid Radiant to become an Emperor!” Voices from three thousand years ago and the present resonated together.

The next moment, the Radiant Sword Saint’s restraints disappeared, and a powerful aura as an Emperor swept out from him. The Radiant Sword Saint let out a roar and swung his sword to destroy the heavenly dao’s manifestation.

The crimson radiance that enveloped the entire Ancient Barren Domain disappeared as the Radiant Sword Saint’s aura continued to rise with golden radiance shining down, looking like a reward given by heavenly dao.

When the Radiant Sword Saint opened his eyes, a powerful saint aura flowed from him and returned to the drained Sword Sect’s saint vein. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Master succeeded!” Ye Guhan cheered. Everyone on the Scarlet Firmament Peak cheered because they knew that the Radiant Sword Saint had successfully crossed his tribulation.
