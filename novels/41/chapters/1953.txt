Chapter 1954 - Bitterness

Lin Yun hovered in the air as a hundred-foot radius around him became covered in blood with countless corpses of the demonic wolves. They were practically shredded into pieces with their internal organs on the ground.

Right then, a massive wolf claw made of saint aura descended from the sky, causing cracks to spread across the ground even more as it fell. This was the might of saint aura and an attack of a demonic beast without a cultivation technique. Thus, its usage of saint aura was crude in comparison to human cultivators. Even so, this was enough to leave Lin Yun with lingering fear.

Lin Yun flicked his finger at the wolf paw, and the azure dragon flew out like a sharp sword stabbing into the claw, causing cracks to swiftly spread and slowing down the claw.

He spread his arms apart and retreated. After learning his lesson, he naturally wouldn’t choose to clash with the saint aura head-on.

When the azure dragon pierced through the claw, it returned to Lin Yun.

The center of the claw was radiating with a silver radiance before it collapsed. A colossal figure descended from the sky, the fully recovered Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf.

“I bet my saint aura doesn’t feel good, right?” The Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf looked at Lin Yun. It could sense that the saint aura was still within Lin Yun’s body.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“You too. I bet it won’t be easy to deal with the sword intent, or it wouldn’t take you so long to come.” The corner of Lin Yun’s lips rose.

“Hmph. I won’t let you go so easily now; the full moon is arriving!” The Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf didn’t waste any time with Lin Yun. The saint aura within his body violently surged with saint radiance gushing out, before pouncing at Lin Yun.

The Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf was a demonic beast that could unleash an explosive speed, depending on its bloodline. With a flash, it appeared before Lin Yun. It wasn’t because it had disappeared, but it was so fast that Lin Yun’s naked eyes couldn’t catch up.

But the Flower Burial Sword forced it to show itself halfway through, and the sword executed the Divine Firefly Sword. The sky became dark, and the Firefly Radiance was executed.

“Ha!” The Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf sneered as saint aura gushed out from its claw.

This time, the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf didn’t dare to be careless, destroying all the phenomena, and the sword was immobilized in its paw.

“You think I’ll fall for that again? Let me see what else you can do!” The Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf roared and released its terrifying aura as a Quasi-Saint monarch demonic beast, causing ripples to fluctuate.

Beyond the domain, the towering trees were immediately smashed into dust, and even Lin Yun suffered a decent impact. But he only took half a step back, which surprised the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf.

But the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf didn’t hesitate to dash forth. The moment it entered Lin Yun’s domain, it immediately felt an immense pressure crushing down, causing it to slow down.

“W-What’s going on?” The Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf was shocked, and the azure dragon dashed over before it could come to its senses.

“Get lost!” The Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf roared and threw out a punch.

Fine cracks immediately appeared on the azure dragon, sending it flying away. But the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf didn’t slow down and arrived before Lin Yun with one step.

Lin Yun squinted his pupils because the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf purposely revealed a flaw, wanting to lure Lin Yun to bring out the Black Tortoise Chains. But Lin Yun didn’t fall for it, and his hands began to join together with a shining radiance. He began to form the Blue Dragon Seal, Golden Dragon Seal, Silver Dragon Seal, and Sovereign Dragon Seal.

The blue-jade and golden-purple dragon runes fused when the Sovereign Dragon Seal was formed. When the two dragon runes fused, Lin Yun's aura increased, and he clashed with the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf head-on.

When the dragon fist and wolf claw clashed, Lin Yun merely retreated, making the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf more furious before it dashed forth.

As the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf’s saint aura swept out, various claws rapidly flew out.

Lin Yun faced the incoming attack head-on, and his performance wasn’t inferior to the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf within the domain. The other party didn’t notice that it had slowed down, and its attacks became clearer in Lin Yun’s eyes.

Just like that, they exchanged over a hundred moves, and Lin Yun was covered with injuries, despite bringing out the Azure Dragon Divine Physique. But he was standing firmly on the ground.

This naturally made the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf furious because Lin Yun was no different from an ant in its eyes. But even when Lin Yun was bleeding from the corner of his lips and eyes, he still wore a smile on his lips.

“Wolfie, is this all you have? The full moon will arrive if you don’t give it your all.” Lin Yun’s hair fluttered in the wind and his white clothes were covered in blood. He was actually putting on a strong front, since it was almost time for the Azure Dragon Divine Physique to dissipate.

At that time, he would be killed with a strike without his domain and the Azure Dragon Divine Physique. But he wasn’t concerned about his life, but something else, since he still had his senior brother.

But this also meant that the Azure Dragon Sword Heart had a flaw that needed to be perfected. He didn’t have much time or he would have to suffer, even if he didn’t die.

The Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf raised its head to look at the moon and became increasingly anxious.

On the other hand, Ye Guhan was enjoying the fight.

“You’re courting death!” The Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf lost it, and its body began to shrink with silver runes appearing on its fur. It seemed to have gone berserk, and the domain became unstable.

The corner of Lin Yun’s lips twitched when he saw this scene and couldn’t help inwardly cursing. What had he done to have someone like Ye Guhan as his senior brother? He was only at the Profound Death Stage but had to face a Quasi-Saint monarch demonic beast.

Lin Yun had no choice but to grit his teeth and hold on. But the Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf had become stronger, and it became tough for Lin Yun to hold on. Meanwhile, he began to ponder if he had any flaws in his domain.

As Lin Yun pondered, the Myriad Astral Celestial Art scriptures appeared in his mind. He had already forged the dragon skeleton with starlight and the soul with thunderstorms, so what was he still lacking?

Just as Lin Yun pondered, the Blue Dragon, Golden Dragon, and Silver Dragon Seals shattered. The Azure Dragon Divine Physique dissolved, and Lin Yun was sent flying a thousand meters away. As blood splashed, the saint aura within Lin Yun’s body was on the verge of going rampant.

“Brat, what other means do you have?” The Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf roared and coldly looked at Lin Yun.

“I asked you if you still have any other methods!” The Silver-Moon Alpha Wolf roared and arrived before Lin Yun, raising its claw, wanting to slam against Lin Yun’s head.

This made Lin Yun’s face change because he could clearly sense the difference between him and a Quasi-Saint. Facing life and death situations, the process of Lin Yun’s thoughts increased, and he wondered what else he was lacking.

“Soul and sword united…” A voice echoed beside Lin Yun’s ears and he suddenly received an insight.
