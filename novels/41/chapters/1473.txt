Chapter 1474 - Above the Firmament Sword Intent

In the end, the ninth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flower still fell into Lin Yun’s hands. To be precise, the ninth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flower was in his hands ever since he snatched it. Now, the Twin Stars of the Earth Ranking didn’t dare to fight. So no one naturally dared to fight Lin Yun.

It was needless to say that Lin Yun had become the champion of the Five Peaks Competition. Some people were unhappy, but others were happy because no matter what, the Five Peaks Competition this time was really exciting.

Lin Yun’s appearance brought more excitement to the Five Peaks Competition. In the past, the Five Peaks Competition was a stage for the Twin Stars of the Earth Ranking to shine, completely outshining the radiance of the other geniuses on the Earth Ranking.

Today, Lin Yun appeared out of nowhere and defeated everyone. Even after being restricted for an hour, he still became the champion, and such an achievement was rare, even in the Sword Sect.

But everyone knew that Lin Yun was worthy of this glory as the champion because they couldn’t find someone more suitable. Without mentioning the light he was emitting at the last moment, he had already become the champion when he used the Aquaheaven Sword Technique.

However, Lin Yun chose another path that no one dared to use. Not only did he want to defeat his opponent, he wanted to make his opponent feel convinced. As he said, the Sword Sect would change entirely from today onwards. At the very least, the situation of the Divine Firmament Peak, which didn’t have any existence in the past and was often bullied by others, would completely change.

When others considered that he had only joined the Sword Sect for less than six months and thought of his current achievement, they couldn’t help feeling their scalps tingle. Lin Yun swept through the Earth Ranking in just six months, including the Twin Stars of the Earth Ranking.

Aside from being unrivaled, they couldn’t find another word to describe Lin Yun. At this moment, everyone was only filled with praises for the sect master for promoting Lin Yun as a heaven direct disciple.

“Mu Chuan, how do you think he is when compared to Jian Jingtian?” Mu Xuankong asked with a smile as he looked at Mu Chuan. The other peak masters were also stunned before their eyes fell onto Mu Chuan. They also wanted to know if Lin Yun would become Jian Jingtian’s successor.

Mu Chuan pondered for a long time before he replied, “He’s not the same as Junior Brother Jian Jingtian. His sword is purer than Junior Brother’s but also less sharp. He’s Lin Yun, and Jian Jingtian is Jian Jingtian. The two can’t be compared together.”

“What if they really had to be compared?” Mu Xuankong asked.

This time, Mu Chuan fell into a long silence before he replied, “If you really want to compare, I don’t wish Lin Yun to be another Jian Jingtian. He just has to be himself and not anyone else.”

Mu Xuankong took out a box and handed it to Mu Chuan. “This is the Dragon-Blooded Crystal. Give it to him on my behalf. If possible, I also wish for him to be himself, and he doesn’t have to be anyone else!”

On the Celestial Observing Stage, Mu Qingqing tilted her head while looking at her elder sister. Her elder sister was wearing a smile, and Mu Qingqing had to be honest that her elder sister was really beautiful.

“Big Sister, why don’t you go and meet him? This is already the third time…” Mu Qingqing playfully smiled.

“No. I have to leave now.” Mu Xueqin smiled. This Five Peaks Competition gave her a lot of surprises, and her mood was better than she had imagined. She was really looking forward to seeing what Lin Yun could achieve in the future. Just thinking about that, Mu Xueqin couldn’t help wearing a gentle smile on her face.

But she also had to work hard because the ones that would support the Sword Sect in the Ancient Barren Domain were Heaven Ranking disciples like them. She just hoped that Lin Yun could grow quickly. Once the saints’ disciples come out, the younger generation of the Sword Sect would fully grow up.

When the Five Peaks Competition ended, Flower Burial Lin Yun’s name had reached an unprecedented height in the Sword Sect. If the Twin Stars of the Earth Ranking’s reputation was higher than Lin Yun’s before, no one else except for geniuses on the Heaven Ranking could suppress Lin Yun now. This included some Dragon Pulse Realm disciples.

Three days later, Lin Yun had been in the Cloud Soaring Peak, adjusting his state. Although the Five Peaks Competition battle might have seemed easy, Lin Yun had already reached the point of exhaustion. It wasn’t exactly easy for Lin Yun to control the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron with the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra. They had really taxed him.

But fortunately, his sword intent had reached the pinnacle of the firmament sword intent. Otherwise, he was unsure who would win or lose. Even Jin Xuanyi and Ji Shuxuan only grasped the quasi-firmament sword intent.

Lin Yun’s sword intent was a whole level higher than theirs, and the difference was fatal, especially for a swordsman. After that battle, Lin Yun gained a deeper comprehension of sword intent.

“Time to refine the ninth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flower…” Lin Yun opened his palm and the Azure Lotus Sword Flower bloomed in his hand, emitting a dense floral fragrance.

As the floral fragrance was being emitted, the dual sword souls in the center of Lin Yun’s forehead became excited. The Azure Lotus Sword Flower was a precious treasure that was fused with the sword intent left behind by Yu Qingfeng. It was a fatal attraction to any swordsman, and the value was much higher than a tenth-grade Spiritual Sword Bead.

“Let me see the profundity of the sword intent left behind by Yu Qingfeng!” Lin Yun’s eyes flickered with his eyes filled with anticipation. The tenth-grade Spiritual Sword Bead was enough to bring his sword intent to the pinnacle of the firmament sword intent. So he looked forward to how far he could reach with the Azure Lotus Sword Flower.

He wondered if it would bring his sword intent above the firmament sword intent. Taking a deep breath, Lin Yun calmed down and spent the next few days refining the ninth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flower. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The Azure Lotus Sword Flower was a treasure for any swordsman, and the ninth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flower was the king of all sword flowers. In just a few days, Lin Yun’s sword intent improved by leaps and bounds under the nourishment of the ninth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flower, but that wasn’t the end.

Simultaneously, his cultivation had significantly improved, and his progress could be comparable to traversing a thousand miles in a day. The Celestial Observing Lake was a high-quality spiritual lake, and the Azure Lotus Sword Flowers born in the lake were used to cultivate even before Yu Qingfeng appeared.

Seven days passed in the blink of an eye before Lin Yun was finally done refining the ninth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flower. At the same time, his cultivation had reached the pinnacle of the two-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm. He only needed an opportunity to make a breakthrough into the three-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm.

His firmament sword intent had also made a breakthrough and his sword ocean was beginning boiling. With a single thought, he could sense that a boundless sword intent was forming in his sword ocean.

When an uncontrollable power spewed from his sword ocean, it made Lin Yun’s intent to start soaring. In the blink of an eye, it had flown beyond the thirty-six layers of heaven, and he could see a vast galaxy.

Such a magnificent scene was shocking. Then, Lin Yun saw a figure slashing a sword, unleashing a dazzling sword ray that looked like a moon streaking across the horizon. Then, the thirty-six layers of heaven began to shatter under the stars that were condensed by the sword intent, causing the heaven to open like a curtain.

When the Sword Sect appeared before Lin Yun, his heart trembled because this was the sword Yu Qingfeng used three thousand years ago. But it was a pity that this scene only lasted for a brief moment before disappearing.

“What a pity…” When Lin Yun opened his eyes, he let out a breath. He inwardly sighed because he couldn’t see the complete sword, nor did he see how Yu Qingfeng leveled the two peaks. He was just one step away from reaching the fifth-grade sword intent, and Lin Yun knew that it wouldn’t be easy for him to have an opportunity to make a breakthrough in the future.

“But my sword intent can be considered the quasi-fifth grade sword intent now…” Lin Yun muttered as he got up.

The pinnacle of the firmament sword intent might be strong, but it was torn apart after Jin Xuanyi and Ji Shuxuan executed their high-grade ghost spirit martial techniques. If he faced the two of them again, it wouldn’t be easy for them to tear his sword intent apart, and he understood what was meant by the firmament sword intent manifesting the sky.

Lin Yun wasn’t too disappointed that he failed to make a breakthrough to the fifth-grade sword intent, nor was he in a rush to achieve it right now. He could sense that his swordsmanship was still somewhat lacking right now, so he couldn't make a breakthrough by relying on external help.

“Mhm?” Lin Yun suddenly turned around and saw two figures who have arrived outside the Cloud Soaring Peak before appearing before him. They were Feng Luan and Mu Qingqing.

“Why is she here?” Lin Yun was puzzled.

Feng Luan was a frequent visitor to the Cloud Soaring Peak, but Mu Qignqing was a rare guest. When Feng Luan looked at Lin Yun, he was surprised before he exclaimed, “My god, you refined the Azure Lotus Sword Flower already? What a waste!”

He could naturally sense the improvement of Lin Yun’s sword intent and cultivation. This was because Lin Yun still had the floral fragrance on him. According to what he knew, one must at least be at the Dragon Pulse Realm to refine the ninth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flower.

“Not exactly.” Lin Yun smiled. His harvest was pretty huge. But this was regarding the firmament sword intent, and he couldn’t describe it that well.

“Senior Brother Lin, we meet again!” Mu Qingqing smiled. She heavily emphasized “Senior Brother” when she addressed him. This was her response to what Lin Yun said during the Five Peaks Competition.

“It’s rare for Junior Sister Mu to pay me a visit.” Lin Yun calmly replied.

This stunned Mu Qingqing. It’s as if she had suffered a huge loss because she would have to address him as “Senior Brother” in the future. But it didn’t sound as bad as she thought, and she smiled, “I should’ve visited you a long time ago, but my big sister forbade me to do so. So I’m here to congratulate you since she has left!”

Lin Yun was surprised when he heard that because, if he remembered correctly, Mu Qingqing’s elder sister was Mu Xueqin, ranked third on the Heaven Ranking. After both parties greeted each other, Feng Luan went straight into the main topic. He was here to deliver the Dragon-Blooded Crystal to Lin Yun.
