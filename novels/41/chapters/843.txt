Chapter 844 - Fortune!

While traveling, Lin Yun arrived in a valley. The valley was a massive barren land filled with rubble and stone.

“There doesn’t seem to be anything special about this place.” Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts as he stepped into the valley. He could sense a wisp of sword aura in the sandstorm. It was as if someone was swinging their sword around and performing a sword technique.

“Indeed.” Lin Yun’s eyes lit up because his guess was correct. There were opportunities hidden in the ordinary sandstorm.

Executing his movement technique, Lin Yun left behind several afterimages and avoided the sword ray. As he went deeper into the barren land, all he could see was dust as the wind howled in his ears.

It didn’t take long for him to see a figure in the sandstorm who was unleashing sword aura towards him. He could sense a terrifying intent contained in the sword aura. Drawing his sword, Lin Yun charged forward. After several clashes, he was pushed back to where he originally stood.

“What’s going on?” Lin Yun was inwardly shocked because the attacks were a little too terrifying. Could it be that there was a peerless sword array nearby? If that was the case, he had to experience it well.

With fighting spirits blazing in his pupils, Lin Yun charged at the strange figure once more. Ten moves later, Lin Yun unleashed his spiritual sword intent. With a dazzling sword ray, he slashed out and destroyed the sandstorm.

The surroundings were calm for a brief moment before the rocks on the ground formed a 300 meter tall giant. The shell of the giant was made of rocks and its inside was held together by the wind.

“Overlord Sword–Breaking Dawn!” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed and Flower Burial lit up brightly. With a domineering slash, Lin Yun made a dent in the giant’s armor. However, the wind hit him and sent him flying.

With blood dripping down from his lips, Lin Yun couldn’t help wearing a weird expression. After all, this fight was extremely strange. Who knew that wind could be used like this?

As he was feeling confused, the hollow eyes of the giant suddenly shined brightly with two sword rays. Facing the sword rays, Lin Yun wore a grave expression. Then, he enveloped his sword with wind intent and lightning intent. His terrifying sword aura caused a violent gale to start blowing with lightning. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

With boundless origin energy poured into his sword, Lin Yun’s sword ray unleashed a resounding dragon roar. Holding onto his sword with both of his hands, swung his sword out.

A colossal azure dragon appeared behind Lin Yun that was enveloped in thunderstorm intent. Lightning crackled on the azure dragon’s scales while a violent gale surged on its claws. When the azure dragon charged forward, it clashed with the two sword rays head-on. After shattering the sword rays, the azure dragon went for the giant’s head.

The giant’s head exploded from the thunderstorm intent. Slowly, its body was reduced to dust. However, once the dust was swept up by the wind, the giant, now made of wind, rotated and shot sword aura towards Lin Yun.

“Overlord Sword–Tai’a Slash!” Lin Yun pushed the Overlord Sword to the limit and swung his sword out. Creating a full moon, the sword aura began to rain down on the sword aura.

“It didn’t dissipate?” Lin Yun frowned because the giant was giving him a headache. The giant roared and bolts of lightning tore through the sky like sharp blades.

“At the current rate, this will go on forever…” Lin Yun decisively fused his thunderstorm intent into his Azure Dragon Sword Aura. In the next second, the azure dragon’s eyes lit up brightly. At this moment, Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon Sword Aura had reached an unprecedented height.

Lin Yun’s azure dragon aura combined with the thunderstorm intent was comparable to his spiritual sword intent.

Supreme Dominance!

A bright light shined from Lin Yun as he swung his sword at the wind giant. This attack had combined six forms of the Overlord Sword together, splitting the colossal giant in half.

“What is this?” Lin Yun saw a towering azure tree before him when the dust and wind settled down. Without any hesitation, he dashed towards the towering tree. As he got closer, the tree became larger than he had imagined. However, he was cautious and didn’t get too close. He ended up staring at it from 1,000 meters away.

When he took a step forward, the tree branches began to tremble and a violent gale started to blow. Lin Yun didn’t hesitate to release his sword intent, but the violent wind forced his eyes shut.

“The wind from before came from this tree?” Lin Yun muttered with skepticism on his face. Leaves slowly drifted from the branches and each leaf contained shocking wind intent, which confirmed Lin Yun’s speculation.

It didn’t take long for the ground to be covered with a layer of leaves. It only took Lin Yun a second of hesitating before he stepped on the pile. When he walked on the leaves, he sensed a boundless sword intent. It felt like he was stepping on the surface of water that was formed by wind and lightning intent.

He was cautious when he walked, so he pushed his spiritual sword intent to the limit. He knew that he would be torn into pieces if he wasn’t careful. When he arrived underneath the tree, an ancient book fell down from the massive tree branches.

“Fortune martial technique?” Lin Yun reached out to receive the book. ‘Azure Firmament Sword Sutra’ was printed on the front of the book. Every stroke on the cover looked boundless and majestic.

This scene made Lin Yun’s heart throb violently. He had a feeling that this sword technique might be a complete fortune martial technique based on the high quality writing on the cover. When he flipped the book open and saw the contents, he instantly became confident about his speculation.

“In ancient times, there was a divine tree named Azure Firmament. Its wood could give birth to wind and its leaves could form lightning. I was fortunate to see the tree and comprehend this sword technique. The Azure Firmament Sword Sutra is a top-tier greater fortune martial technique.

“Aside from the sword sutra, there’s also the Azure Firmament Thirteen Swords. My name is Jian Wuya, and I created this sword technique by luck. If you can obtain this martial technique, you have passed the test of this Azure Firmament Tree sapling. If you practice this technique, you can’t bring dishonor to it.”

Lin Yun instantly rejoiced because he found a complete fortune martial technique that contained both a sword sutra and a sword technique. Furthermore, the grade wasn’t low since it was a top-tier ordinary fortune martial technique. According to Yue Weiwei, a martial technique of this level was rare, even in the bigger world.

“I really found one.” Lin Yun stored the book before he bowed at the Azure Firmament Tree. The Iris Sword Sutra was extraordinary, but it didn’t come with a sword technique. The Dustlight Sword Art and Overlord Sword weren’t weak, but they didn’t come with a sword sutra.

Swordsmen pursued perfection. If there was a sword sutra and technique that came as a set, a swordsman could fully unleash its might.

“This trip wasn’t for nothing.” Lin Yun concluded that no one else could compete with his harvest on this mountain. Most people would return empty-handed and they wouldn’t be able to come here if they weren’t meticulous.

Even if he separated the Azure Firmament Sword Sutra and the Azure Dragon Thirteen Swords, they would still be powerful fortune martial techniques. One was enough to cause a huge shock in the Ancient Southern Domain. In the end, Lin Yun obtained it, bringing him great fortune.
