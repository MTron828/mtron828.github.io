Chapter 2460 - Myriad Celestial Sword

“You have already expected it? Stop boasting,” the White Emperor said in disbelief.

The Black Emperor said nothing because he didn’t want to explain.

Lin Yun took a deep breath and carried the Iris Sword Box. When the strap locked onto his chest, the buckle rotated, fixating the sword box to his back.

Runes began appearing on the sword box the next second as a boundless saint aura poured into Lin Yun’s body. When the remnant energy left behind by the Heavenly Dragon Bone surged, the two energies merged, and an even more powerful aura burst out from Lin Yun, enveloping him in golden radiance accompanied by dragon roars.

This scared Lin Yun, and he would’ve lost his rationale if it was the past just by relying on the remnant energy of the Heavenly Dragon Bone.

“Behave yourself!” Lin Yun formed a seal by using the Flower Burial Sword to suppress the Heavenly Dragon. But surprisingly, the two energies did not go berserk after merging together and even formed a circulation with the Iris Sword Box, like the meridians in a human’s body. The energies flowed to the Iris Secret Realm through the sword box.

After circulating for an entire cycle in the Iris Secret Realm, the remnant energies from the Heavenly Dragon Bone and Heavenly Dragon’s soul calmed down when they flowed back to his body.

“It does seem to work. This sword box is magical, and it feels like I have another clone cultivating on my behalf,” Lin Yun looked at the Black and White Emperors with disbelief.

“There’s something like that?” The Black Emperor was shocked.

The White Emperor said enviously, “The Iris Sword Saint left the best inheritance to you. This is equivalent to having a cultivating puppet to help you cultivate day and night. On the other hand, you can comprehend saint dao and sword intent.”

The Black Emperor didn’t care and asked, “Try and see if you can fight.”

Lin Yun nodded and unleashed the flower representing Yin-Yang Dao, performing the Yin-Yang Fist. A Yin-Yang Diagram appeared beneath his feet, and a trigram appeared. Phenomena also began to appear when Lin Yun performed the fist technique, showing the full profundity of Yin-Yang Dao.

“Let’s go while he adapts to his current cultivation,” the Black Emperor heaved in relief. Lin Yun needed time to adapt to his current cultivation after reaching the Great Saint Realm, or he couldn’t control his strength. The three retreated to ten thousand miles away with their eyes on Lin Yun, staring at him and afraid that there might be an accident.

They could do nothing about it because Lin Yun’s cultivation rose too quickly. Since ancient times, no one’s cultivation has risen so quickly. Even if it relied on the Heavenly Dragon Bone, he might be able to take another step further after refining the remnant energies.

The White and Black Emperors couldn’t help but look worried, but Lil’ Purple was calm and composed.

The White Emperor asked, “Lord Phoenix, you don’t seem worried?”

“Perhaps it might be unusual for human cultivators, but it’s common among divine beasts,” Lil’ Purple smiled, tugging her arms together. She continued, “Divine beasts are born with immense strength, and they didn’t even have to cultivate because their cultivation would rise along with their age. It’s just like how phoenixes undergo nirvana because their strength multiplies.”

“But Lin Yun is a human cultivator,” the Black Emperor said with a grave expression.

“But he already possessed the Divine Dragon Sovereign Physique before refining the Heavenly Dragon Bone and received the acknowledgment of the Azure Dragon Sovereign Constellation. It can be comparable to acquired divine physique,” Lil’ Purple said. She added, “Now, the Heavenly Dragon Divine Physique is stronger than many natal divine physiques, like the Natal Dao Physique, Dragon-Phoenix Divine Physique, Great Solar Divine Physique, and Great Lunar Divine Physique. They were all inferior compared to the Heavenly Dragon Divine Physique. Most importantly, he has the heart of a youth, fearless and courageous, like the rising sun. I believe he can adapt to his cultivation swiftly.”

“Yeah. The heart of a youth is rare, and it looks like I fell into a dilemma,” the Black Emperor smiled.

Not only did Lin Yun have the heart of a youth, but he also had the hardworking trait and unwavering determination of a youth. Not many people can persevere in something, and most youths spend their time in joy.

Lin Yun drew his sword and started performing a sword technique. But this time, his sword technique was different as many flaws were fixed, and the Heavenly Dragon Sword also became even more terrifying under the empowerment of the Heavenly Dragon Divine Physique.

If he fought with Tian Xuanzi now, the latter wouldn’t be able to find so many flaws. But when Lin Yun swung his sword, he recalled what Tian Xuanzi told him when they fought.

Let me teach you! We should have a pure heart and be arrogant, prideful, and ruthless!

Lin Yun suddenly came to his senses and realized that Tian Xuanzi was teaching him back then. He suddenly saw Tian Xuanzi standing before him, and they clashed with their swords once more, performing the Heavenly Dragon Sword, Divine Phoenix Sword, Dragon-Phoenix Sword Art, Divine Firefly Sword, Yin-Yang Sword, and Nirvana Sword.

Lin Yun performed all the sword techniques he grasped and slowly completed them before a new flame appeared. When he stopped, he saw Tian Xuanzi looking at him with a smile, “So, am I right? Hahaha!”

When Lin Yun looked up again, Tian Xuanzi had disappeared and could no longer be found. Coming to his senses, Lin Yun realized it was an illusion from the start.

“So he has comprehended the Divine Candlelight Sword of the Divine Firefly Sword...” Lin Yun muttered.

The Black Emperor, White Emperor, and Lil’ Purple came over right then. The White Emperor smiled, “Flower Burial, what are you thinking?”

“I was thinking of Tian Xuanzi. Now that I looked at it, he had no intentions to kill me right from the start,” Lin Yun replied.

“Why are you thinking about him? He’s just a lapdog,” the White Emperor smiled.

“Tian Xuanzi might be a painting, but it was created from the Southern Emperor. This is why he can break free from the painting before his death and die without regret,” the Black Emperor said.

Keeping the Flower Burial Sword, Lin Yun said, “I’m more or less done. I can return to the Sword Sect now.”

“No rush. There’s something you have to do,” the Black Emperor said. “You’ve never performed the secret technique taught to you by the Iris Sword Saint that can slay deities, right?”

“Yeah,” Lin Yun nodded. “It’s not easy to execute, and there’s no target.”

“I’ll be your target,” the Black Emperor said.

The White Emperor’s face changed, and he spoke out, “Blacky, don’t be impulsive!”

“Don’t try it,” Lil’ Purple said with a grave expression.

“He has to try it,” the Black Emperor said. “Or do you want him to try it when he faces the Empress?”

Lin Yun’s face began changing when he heard that as he was feeling uncertain.

“I’ve made up my mind,” the Black Emperor said.

Lin Yun had never faced this situation before, and he said, after a brief pondering, “The secret technique is called the Myriad Celestial Sword. It’s separated into three seals: the Flying Sword, Seeking Dao, and Deity Purging. If senior wants to try, I can attempt without using the seven sovereign divine runes. After all, my exhaustion will be great if I use the sovereign divine runes.”

“Okay,” the Black Emperor nodded.

Seeing that they couldn’t persuade the Black Emperor, Lil’ Purple and the White Emperor retreated to the side, but they didn’t dare to let down their guard.

Lin Yun took a deep breath and began forming seals with his hands. His sword intent and vitality merged into the ground when he performed the Flying Sword Seal. When the seal bloomed, boundless vitality and Heavenly Desolate Sword Intent began to merge and form into a thousand rays, soaring to the sky.

When he performed the second seal, the Seeking Dao Seal, beads of sweat fell from his forehead, and his facial expression also became pale with his ten fingers trembling. His saint origin, sword intent, and vitality was rapidly being exhausted. Countless people also appeared on this ground, some roaring at the sky, some touching their forehead, and some kowtowing on the ground.

As the Nirvana Dao bloomed behind Lin Yun, space and time became distorted as all lives who had one lived began to appear. The deceased were brought back through Nirvana Dao, and this seal also required Nirvana Dao to execute.

Time and space began to overlap as all lives began kowtowing to heaven. Ten thousand sword rays also tore apart the layers of heaven with a vortex of primal chaos appearing. This instantly made Lil’ Purple and the White Emperor feel a great pressure because the heavenly dao’s might from the primal chaos vortex wasn’t any inferior compared to the Radiant Sword Emperor’s tribulation.

Performing the third seal, the Deity Purging Seal, a giant sword flew out from the vortex. At the far end of the vortex, it felt as though heavenly dao had manifested into a giant, wielding the sword and stabbing it forward, falling onto the Black Emperor in the next second.

With a huge impact, the continent they were on crumbled under the sword. Lin Yun also felt like the manifestation of heavenly dao when he hovered in the sky, becoming indifferent. When he calmed down, he lost his memories at the very last moment and looked puzzled.

“Stop dazing off. I can’t find Blacky anywhere.” The White Emperor supported Lin Yun as they looked for the Black Emperor in the ruins. When they came out from the thirty-six layers of heaven, they found the Black Emperor in a valley located at the Ancient Barren Domain.

The Black Emperor’s face was pale and looked weak, but he had joy on his face with light shining in his eyes.

“My status as a myth was shattered, and my cultivation nearly fell from the Emperor Realm. The Iris Sword Saint didn’t lie to you!” The Black Emperor ran over in excitement, ignoring his injuries.

But seeing this, the White Emperor wanted to give him a slap. How could someone be so happy when their status as a myth was shattered? Not to mention that his cultivation nearly fell from the Emperor Realm.

“This secret technique can slay deities, and I’m certain of it,” the Black Emperor said.

Lin Yun felt guilty, and he asked, “Can you recover your status as a myth?” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Flower Burial, that’s not important,” the Black Emperor smiled.

“What...” Lil’ Purple was speechless, looking at the Black Emperor and Lin Yun. One had to be supported by the White Emperor while the other nearly fell from the Emperor Realm. They were pretty alike now that she looked at it.
