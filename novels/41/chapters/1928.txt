Chapter 1929 - Low Profile! (1)

After three days of intense battle, a hundred people stood out from the loser group to participate in the final battle. The final battle would determine the top ten rankings. This was a brutal and exciting battle because those who entered the top ten would receive many rewards. Just the Nirvana Pellets alone were enough to make everyone envious.

Nirvana Pellets were cultivating resources for those at the Nirvana Stage, and you could only obtain them by exchanging with contribution points in the Heavenly Dao Sect. Aside from that, those in the top ten would further be rewarded with contribution points to exchange for anything they want. Most importantly, they would be able to enter the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda.

There were many disciples gathered on the Heavenly Dao Altar. There were inner disciples and saint disciples who were eliminated. Although the top ten hadn’t been determined, the favored candidates had already appeared based on everyone’s performances in the previous round.

The first in the ranking was Wang Muyan, the Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden. She was the youngest and had already been cultivating within the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda long ago. She was on a whole new level compared to the other saint disciples, regardless of talent or aptitude.

The second and third-ranking were naturally Zhang Yue and Ye Feifan, and they were both geniuses with a Saint as their masters. They had been a saint disciple for a long time, and there was a vast difference between saint’s disciples and saint disciples.

The one ranked fourth was Lin Tongbei, an older-generation saint disciple.

Wang Yue was ranked seventh, winning thirty matches in the Loser Group, and made it to the finals. As for Ye Qingtian, he was also ranked in the top ten by everyone. No matter how unhappy they were, it was unquestionable that Ye Qingtian could make it into the top ten with the six sword forms of the Divine Firefly Sword.

Lin Yun listened to Chen Feng’s explanation and wasn’t too bothered, initially. But he discovered that in the top hundred, the top ten were practically arranged in this order, which was a public acknowledgment.

“This is too much. Not only are Zhang Yue and Ye Feifan ranked in the top three, even Wang Yue, who you’ve defeated, is ranked seventh!” Chen Feng said furiously. He and the other Indigo Thunder Peak disciples were also unhappy.

Many disciples from the Indigo Thunder Peak came together, and they were here to show Ye Qingtian their support. After all, Ye Qingtian became an influential figure within the Indigo Thunder Peak.Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Luo Chen walked over with the Nether Orchid Courtyard’s disciples. He looked at Chen Feng and coldly said, “Senior Brother Wang was only careless, and he didn’t expect Ye Qingtian to grasp the Divine Firefly Sword. If he knew, how could he be injured? Do you think the Indigo Thunder Peak can suppress my Nether Orchid Courtyard?”

“That’s right. Ye Qingtian’s victory wasn’t upright, and Senior Brother Wang had gone easy on him.”

“Let’s wait and watch. The top ten rankings are only temporary. It’ll be weird if he can even make it into the top ten when the next round begins!” The Nether Orchid Courtyard’s disciples spoke out. They had a strong grudge against Ye Qingtian, not to mention Wang Yue was their senior brother. So they were naturally unhappy with Ye Qingtian and the Indigo Thunder Peak’s disciples.

The argument lasted long and stopped only after Quasi-Saint Chi Yun arrived.

Lin Yun glanced around, but the three groups hadn’t started yet. The number of people in each group differed, so their time was also separated. The Tian Group and Huang Group had fewer people, so they would naturally start later. On the contrary, the Xuan Group had the least amount of people, and had already finished yesterday.

Quasi-Saint Chi Yun hovered in the air, saying, “I believe everyone has seen the order in the name list. We’ve determined the top ten after observing your cultivations and performances. This round is simple. The hundred people will divide into ten groups, and the top smaller ten will be divided. The champion for each smaller group will be in the top ten on the Ranking Battle…”

Lin Yun instantly understood the rules. The Quasi-Saint Elder felt they could make it into the top ten with their strength, thus separating them into ten different smaller groups to prevent them from being eliminated.

After Quasi-Saint Chi Yun finished speaking, medals flew out from his sleeve towards everyone. When Lin Yun held onto his medal, he saw that he was assigned to the tenth group, with ‘0’ as his number. This meant everyone else in the group was the challenger. But he also had a benefit. He could lose once. As for the others, they would be eliminated if they lost once.

When everyone examined their medals, an azure-clothed figure flew over from the horizon. When this person appeared, everyone could feel their swords vibrating.

“Calm down…” Lin Yun firmly held onto the Flower Burial Sword.

As for everyone else, they were in a more pathetic state because they were trying their best to calm their swords.

When Lin Yun raised his head, the azure-clothed figure soon descended on the altar where the Saint Elders were.

The Saint Elders on the altar quickly stood up and cupped their hands together, including the Nether Slaughtering Saint Sovereign. Only the Dragon Origin Great Saint didn’t stand out and merely nodded his head as a greeting.

“Martial Aunt Heavenly Jade, why are you here this year? Did anyone catch your eyes?” The Nether Slaughtering Saint Sovereign smiled.

The Heavenly Jade Saint Sovereign was donned an azure robe, looking to be in her twenties. It was as though she wouldn’t get old and was maintaining a youthful appearance. She replied, “There’s no need to be so polite. I heard there are many geniuses with swords in the Di Group, so I came to take a look.”

“The Di Group is somewhat lacking, and they can’t compare to the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden. Martial Aunt, you should come again in a few days for the Tian Group,” said the Nether Slaughtering Saint Sovereign. He was trying to get on the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint’s good side, and he didn’t have any pride in belonging to a Saint Sovereign.

But it didn’t seem inappropriate in the eyes of the other Saint Elders. After all, just her title as one of the Eastern Desolation’s Three Sword Saints was enough for them to be respectful. There was no question that the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint was much stronger than them, regardless of cultivation or strength.

Aside from those secluded experts in the Kunlun Realm, only the two other Sword Saints could be comparable to her.

“There’s also a genius in the Di Group,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said, and her gaze swept through Lin Yun’s group.

Simultaneously, the Di Group shook with the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint’s arrival.

“Martial Ancestor Heavenly Jade actually turned up for the Ranking Battle? This is really weird… Can it be that someone has caught her attention?”

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint had a high seniority within the Heavenly Dao Sect, not to mention she was one of the Three Sword Saints within the Eastern Desolation. So she was a martial ancestor in the eyes of many younger disciples. Her existence in the Heavenly Dao Sect was equivalent to the Radiant Sword Saint in the Sword Sect; both were considered martial ancestors in their various sects.

“I heard that Martial Ancestor Heavenly Jade has been trying to look for a genius swordsman in the Heavenly Dao Sect to guide herself!”

“Are you serious? They'll soar to the sky if anyone can catch her attention!”

“We have to perform well later!” Everyone was excited.

Zhang Yue, Wang Feifan, and the others already forgot about Ye Qingtian’s existence, and they had flames blazing within their pupils when they looked at the Heavenly Dao Altar. That place was enveloped in saint radiance, and no one could see the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint’s actual appearance. But they all became excited when they knew that the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint had arrived.

If I can catch the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint’s attention, Ye Qingtian won’t be able to suppress me with the name of the Great Saint anymore! Ye Feifan inwardly thought. Not to mention the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint was one of the Three Sword Saints, and she was more famous than the Dragon Origin Great Saint.

Zhang Yue naturally held the same thoughts because Saint Sovereigns were already at the top of the pyramid within the Heavenly Dao Sect. He was fearless in the past, but everything changed after he ran into Ye Qingtian again. But he could do nothing to Ye Qingtian because of his identity as a Great Saint’s direct disciple.

“I have to perform well this time. Master said that this is related to the Sword Assembly.” Zhang Yue knew more information than others and naturally thought more about it.

On the contrary, Lin Yun sneaked a peek at the Heavenly Dao Altar. Despite seeming calm on the surface, he was nervous in his heart. After all, he was reckless in probing the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint with his sword intent in the past.

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint could be considered an old friend of his master, but he didn’t know about their current relationship. What if they used to be lovers, and his master abandoned her? But Lin Yun soon shook his head, hoping it wasn’t real.

“Martial Aunt, that’s Ye Feifan. A newly risen genius of my Ye Clan!”

“Martial Aunt, that’s my disciple, Zhang Yue. He’s currently ranked in the top three on the Di Group. He possesses a saint physique, and his attainment in the sword is pretty decent as well.”

“But Wang Muyan is publicly acknowledged as the strongest in the Di Group.”

“Aside from her, there’s also Lin Tongbei. Everyone only knows of him as an older generation’s saint disciple, but he has hidden himself deeply.”
