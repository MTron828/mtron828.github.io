Chapter 1164 - Undefeated Legend

Lin Yun instantly sensed the enmity in Jiang Lichen’s eyes. When he got close to Ye Ziling, Jiang Lichen didn’t even bother concealing the chill in his eyes.

Sensing that, Lin Yun merely laughed it off while Feng Zhang smiled, “Lin Yun, Senior Brother seems to have some hostility towards you.”

The relationship between the two of them started out bad, but their relationship had gradually gotten better, especially during their trip to Heavenly Aquatic Island. This was also why Feng Zhang called Lin Yun directly by his name now.

Hearing what Feng Zhang said, Lin Yun merely laughed it off. He knew that Feng Zhang was messing with him on purpose. When he turned to look at Feng Zhang, he could see Feng Zhang looking at him with a playful gaze.

“So what if he has an opinion about him? It was Lin Yun who saved Senior Sister’s life in the Heavenly Aquatic Island, not him.” Liu Qingyan laughed. Although everyone in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect had feelings for Ye Ziling, none of them dared to confess it because they knew that they weren’t compatible with Ye Ziling.

So if Liu Qingyan had to choose a side, he would naturally support Lin Yun being together with Ye Ziling. In the past, when Lin Yun hadn’t come to the sect, Jiang Lichen would make use of his identity as the chief disciple to get close to Ye Ziling. It made Liu Qingyan unhappy. So he was naturally happy to see Jiang Lichen’s dark face.

Seeing that Liu Qingyan was trying to cause trouble for him, Lin Yun merely turned to glare at the former. But Liu Qingyan knew that Lin Yun wouldn’t be bothered with such a joke and smiled, “I’m being honest here. We’re all supporting you.”

“That’s right! Senior Sister has never said that she has any feelings for him, but Senior Brother Lin is the best!” Wang Yuruo smiled sweetly. She only knew that Lin Yun was the best and no one could be compared to him.

Hearing all that, Lin Yun merely smiled it off, fearing that Ye Ziling might misunderstand something. But out of his expectation, Ye Ziling replied, “Are you all that free to gossip about others?”

“Hear that?” Lin Yun smiled. At the same time, Lin Yun could sense a familiar gaze directed at him. The gaze naturally came from Luo Hua, who emitted a mysterious aura while her face was covered with a veil, only revealing her eyes. She stood alone on the lake with no one daring to approach her.

“I’ll leave first.” Lin Yun knew what Luo Hua was saying through her gaze.

“Hehe. Senior Brother Lin, take me with you!” Wang Yuruo came over and held onto Lin Yun’s arm.

This made Lin Yun smile bitterly in his heart. Looks like Wang Yuruo had considered Luo Hua as a love rival of Ye Ziling, but Lin Yun really didn’t have any feelings for the two of them.

“Let go.” Ye Ziling glared at Wang Yuruo before she continued, “Behave yourself.”

Seeing that Ye Ziling was genuinely furious, Wang Yuruo let go of Lin Yun’s arm with a sullen expression. This made Lin Yun pat her head. Nodding his head towards Ye Ziling, Lin Yun went over to Luo Hua. His action instantly captivated everyone’s attention.

“Senior Sister, Senior Brother Lin won’t be back now that he has gone over,” said Wang Yuruo unhappily.

“So what? What does that have to do with me?” Ye Ziling asked emotionally.

“My heavens, they’re holding hands!” Wang Yuruo suddenly exclaimed with shock on her face. This had not only attracted the attention of Feng Zhang and Liu Qingyan, but even Ye Ziling turned her head with a shocked expression. The elders were even more shocked because they knew about Luo Hua’s origin.

“What the heck?” Even Jiang Lichen’s lips had twitched looking at this scene.

Feng Zhang and Liu Qingyan couldn’t close their mouths. They didn’t expect that Lin Yun had even subdued Luo Hua.

“Hmph. I don’t like Senior Brother Lin anymore,” said Wang Yuruo.

Ye Ziling was also surprised at this scene. Although she had no feelings for Lin Yun, she still couldn’t help feeling weird looking at this scene. She had no idea when the two of them got so close. Despite all the surrounding gazes, Luo Hua didn’t seem bothered by the attention. However, Lin Yun couldn’t maintain his composure because he knew that they both didn’t have that sort of relationship.

“Cough, cough. Lady Luo…” Lin Yun coughed, trying to take his hand back. But to his surprise, Luo Hua was firmly holding onto his hand.

“What is this?” Luo Hua asked curiously, looking at the hair tied around one of Lin Yun’s fingers.

After an initial shock, Lin Yun finally calmed down and smiled, “That’s a secret. Lady Luo, please let go…”

“This is a strand of hair. She must be the person you’re chasing after, right?” Luo Hua paused briefly before she continued, “She must really love you. She can give up everything except for this strand of hair.”

Her voice sounded ethereal, and it was hard to tell if she was asking Lin Yun the question or herself the question. When Lin Yun raised his head, he was shocked because Luo Hua seemed to know too much about him. Pulling his hand back, Lin Yun replied with his heart fluctuating violently, “Yeah.”

“I didn’t say anything bad about Flower Burial, and I won’t be responsible for Flower Burial’s love debt.” Luo Hua said with a playful smile, but her words made Lin Yun feel a chill down his spine.

Lin Yun knew that she was saying it on purpose. It seemed like Ye Ziling found her to find out more about Flower Burial.

Right at this moment, the sect master arrived with several law-enforcing elders behind him. Every single one of them was emitting a powerful aura that instantly attracted everyone’s attention.

Looking at the sect master, Lin Yun changed the topic, “I thought that you wouldn’t come for the Spirit Astral Mountain.”

“Brother Lin is trying to reach the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm, so how can I not be here to witness it?” Luo Hua smiled before she added, “But there are many things you didn’t think of…”

Mentioning the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm, Lin Yun’s face became grave. Although he had achieved the Azure Dragon Saint Physique and even devoured the origin stone, transforming his physique into a saint artifact, it was still the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm. It was far more dangerous than he could imagine.

After all, many geniuses died trying to reach the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm in ancient times. Even the geniuses of the saint clans didn’t dare to think about it, so what could a swordsman from a lower realm do?

“How confident are you?” Luo Hua asked.

“I’ve left everything to fate. No, even if I’m destined to die, I’ll reach it no matter what!” Lin Yun’s eyes radiated with determination. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Open the mountain!” A voice sounded out as the sect master led the seven law-enforcing elders. As their sword intent blazed, the faces of all the disciples became grave. The Spirit Astral Mountain was the soul of a sect, and opening it would exhaust the sect’s foundation. In fact, the sect would require at least a decade to recover from the damage.

As the sect master and the law-enforcing elders began to form different seals with their fingers, a terrifying aura swept out that even made Lin Yun feel fearful of. As for the other core disciples, all of their faces had become pale. Meanwhile, the disciples who hadn’t reached the Empyrean Realm fell onto their knees.

A powerful sword aura soared into the sky and disappeared from everyone’s view. It tore through the sky, which filled Lin Yun with fear.

Once the sky shattered three times, darkness swept out and a gorgeous starry sky appeared before everyone. Even Lin Yun’s heart was trembling because he had never seen the stars so clearly before.

“Breaking the fourth layer. It looks like the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect isn’t useless after all,” muttered Lil’ Purple while she stood on a mountain outside the lake. Although she said she wouldn’t come, she was still here to watch things unfold. When she turned to look at Lin Yun, she prayed inwardly that Lin Yun would make it out alive. He’ll find the Iris Saint Water sooner or later.

When starlight draped down, it gave everyone on the lake a misconception that they could even pluck the stars in the sky. Then, a crystallized mountain rose from the lake, attracting all the stars in the sky. In a split second, the Azure Dragon, Vermillion Bird, White Tiger, and Black Tortoise constellations appeared.

When dense astral energy shined down, everyone quickly sat down to absorb the sunlight. Just this single wisp of sunlight was comparable to thousands of astral pellets.

As Lin Yun took a deep breath, he turned to look at Luo Hua, “I’m beginning. Lady Luo, please step back for now.”

“Don’t die,” said Luo Hua before she flew away.

Failure means death? Lin Yun smiled upon hearing what Luo Hua said. Since that was the case, then let all the stars in the sky witness him forging his legend!
