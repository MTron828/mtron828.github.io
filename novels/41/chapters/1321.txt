Chapter 1322 - Invincible (2)

Lin Yun naturally wouldn’t just let them off so easily. As his silver hair fluttered in the wind, he pounced at the middle-aged woman while pushing his palm out.

The middle-aged woman had turned into a phoenix, empowered by the sea of flames, she was emitting an ancient aura. But before Lin Yun, who had been empowered by his constellation, his palm easily tore the sea of flames into pieces.

When the sea of flames exploded, the other seven Greater Elysium Core Realm experts quickly made their moves to resist the shockwave from the explosion. But when Lin Yun pushed his palm out once more, the middle-aged woman was beaten out of her phoenix form and returned to her human form.

Upon returning to her human form, her eyes were flickering with fear and everyone was greatly startled by Lin Yun’s strength. It was so much so that they even began to feel goosebumps.

“N-N-No! You can’t kill me! I’m an elder of the Flame Phoenix Sect, and I’m willing to submit to you. From today onwards, the Flame Phoenix Sect will never show our enmity against you!” Killing intent had long disappeared from the middle-aged woman’s face. Instead, it was replaced with panic and fear.

Just as she spoke, a terrifying surge of energy was brewing in the crimson mark on her forehead. In the next second, a crimson beam of light shot out, aimed at Lin Yun’s heart.

But Lin Yun was calm when he saw the crimson beam and allowed it to land on his chest. Under the anticipating gazes of the eight Greater Elysium Core Realm experts, the beam landed on his chest. But it didn’t manage to pierce through his chest. It only produced a metallic sound upon collision instead.

The Silver Moon Mask was a saint artifact forged by the Mo Clan, and this was the reason why Lin Yun could take this attack head-on and come out unscathed.

“N-N-N…” The middle-aged woman screamed out with fear.

But Lin Yun remained indifferent as dragon runes began to gather on his palm. In the next second, his hand turned into a dragon claw that streaked across the distance and landed on the middle-aged woman.

His attack made the middle-aged woman throw out a mouthful of blood. Her internal organs were destroyed under his attack, putting her at death’s door. Beneath his mask, Lin Yun could clearly see that the middle-aged woman was wearing a thin defensive saint artifact that barely saved her life.

“Looks like I’ve underestimated the foundation of you guys from the big sects…” Lin Yun said indifferently.

“Let’s attack him together!” The eight Greater Elysium Core Realm experts recollected themselves and charged over once more after being empowered by their constellations.

A grey-clothed middle-aged man from the Whitebones Gate charged over, wielding a bizarre fan. As black light circulated on the fan, a black miasma that contained a fatal poison began to rise. The poisonous miasma was filled with the aura of corrosion and death, making it hard to defend against.

At this moment, the eight Greater Elysium Core Realm experts were no longer holding back. They were using their strongest attacks.

Lin Yun was also surprised by this attack because an attack like this was rare, and this also meant that there was something weird about that fan. But he didn’t dare to be careless and pushed the Blood Flame Divine Rune in the Azure Dragon Mark to the limit. When crimson flames spread out, the three thousand purple-golden dragon runes were instantly ignited.

With the flames acting as a barrier, the poisonous miasma was instantly incinerated before it could even get close, making Lin Yun appear to be invincible.

“Who the hell are you?! “The Whitebones Gate’s middle-aged man was stumped by this scene. He didn’t expect that his attack would do nothing to Lin Yun, not even to a strand of his hair.

“I am Lin Yun, as well as Flower Burial!” Lin Yun roared before he pushed the Blood Flame Divine Rune to the limit. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

As he began to radiate with light, the Demonic Astral Flowers also began to bloom in his aura ocean, and the golden Demonic Astral Flowers were like bright stars sparkling in the starry sky. The golden light even dyed the snowflakes in the mountain range in gold and made them look like stars as well. At this moment, Lin Yun’s Seven Flowers Convergence had created a rare phenomenon.

As thunderclouds roared in the sky, bolts of terrifying lightning fell, enveloping a myriad mile in radius. At the same time, they could all hear Lin Yun's declaration, as if he was telling his own legend. After all, he was the champion of the Ninth Heavenly Path, known as the strongest champion in the history of Heavenly Paths!

“How is this possible?” Qin Tian, Zhang Ting, and Jiang Lichen were stunned as they quickly distanced themselves from the fight.

Far away, Mu Qingqing, Lei Jue, and the rest who were observing the fight were also shocked by this terrifying phenomenon. The entire mountain range was enveloped in starlight, and the thunderclouds were roaring and unleashing countless bolts of lightning. This was simply too terrifying!

“It is time to bring this to an end!” Lin Yun roared before he began to glow brightly and pushed the Aurora Dragon painting to the limit. His Sovereign Constellation shone brightly, and all the pressure came pressing down on the grey-clothed middle-aged man from the Whitebones Gate.

“N-N-N-No…” The grey-clothed middle-aged man’s constellation began to break apart under the light released by Lin Yun’s Sovereign Constellation. He had underestimated the power of Lin Yun’s constellation. After all, there were only a hundred Sovereign Constellations ever since the Ancient Era, and all of them represented invincibility.

So even if Lin Yun didn’t bring out the full power of his Sovereign Constellation, the current power was enough to cause a great shock.

As the grey-clothed man released a scream, he died under the pressure from Lin Yun’s constellation. Just a moment ago, they wanted to use their constellations to suppress Lin Yun to death. But not only did they fail, one of them even died under the suppression of Lin Yun’s constellation now.

The other seven Greater Elysium Core Realm experts already did their best trying to assist the middle-aged man from the Whitebones Gate, but they were too slow. In the end, they could only watch as the grey-clothed middle-aged man turned to a mist of blood.

Just like that, a pinnacle Greater Elysium Core Realm had fallen. But this was only the beginning. Since he was going to reveal his true identity as Flower Burial, he naturally had to show a strong display of his strength.

Lin Yun’s surroundings were enveloped in a thunderstorm. Circulating his Azure Dragon Saint Art and even using his sky sword intent, Lin Yun unleashed his full strength in his fight with them. His attention turned to the middle-aged man from the Myriad Beast Gate.

After a few attacks, the middle-aged man unleashed his beast form. This was a white lion with demonic light flickering in his pupils.

“If you beg for mercy right now, I can consider sparing your life.” A pair of golden wings unfolded behind Lin Yun, and he placed his palm on the middle-aged man’s forehead. No matter how the middle-aged man struggled, he couldn’t even budge and could only be at Lin Yun’s mercy.

“Dream on!” The white lion roared as an ancient demonic sound came from his mouth. This was his bloodline divine ability, the Ancient Demonic Lion Roar. At his full strength, he could easily kill hundreds of experts on the same level as him.

Facing his roar, the pair of golden wings behind Lin Yun folded and enveloped him. But even so, the sound still pierced through his wings and entered his mind, causing his eardrums to tremble with cracks appearing on the purple-golden dragon runes.

But just when the sound was about to wreak havoc within his body, the golden human in Lin Yun’s sword ocean emitted a sword vibration that suppressed the demonic sound. When Lin Yun’s wings opened up, the white lion was shocked to see that Lin Yun came out unscathed after taking his divine ability at such a close distance. In the next second, fear began to rise from the depths of his heart and soon enveloped him.

“Firmament…” But before the white lion could finish, a golden crow and silver phoenix flew from Lin Yun’s body as he executed the Dragon Sun and Moon Cauldron.

Under this attack, the head of the white lion exploded, losing his life on the spot. Just like that, another one of the seven remaining Greater Elysium Core Realm experts had died.

“S-S-St-Stop him!” The remaining six Greater Elysium Core Realm experts thoroughly panicked and quickly made their moves.

But this time, Lin Yun had gone berserk with his silver hair beginning to flutter violently. When another light flew out from his body, a painting opened up.

Looking back in the nine nethers, not even deities and gods would dare to look directly.

This time, it was one of the eight ominous beasts, the Demonic Phoenix. When the Demonic Phoenix and Aurora Dragon paintings overlapped, the pressure released by the two paintings instantly made the six of them throw out blood while they were sent flying away.

When he charged over, a silver saint rune was blooming in the palm of the elder from the Silverblood Elysium that was drawn into a painting, wanting to stop Lin Yun.

But Lin Yun easily crushed the painting with a grasp of his hand before he threw out a punch. His attack easily created a hole in the chest of the elder from the Silverblood Elysium. When the elder lowered his head to look at his chest in disbelief, his vitality swiftly dwindled before he fell to the ground.

After dealing with the elder from the Silverblood Elysium, Lin Yun executed the Golden Crow Nine Transformation to dodge the attack from the Flame Phoenix Sect’s middle-aged woman. Lin Yun then turned around and flicked his finger, unleashing a silver beam that pierced the center of the middle-aged woman’s brows, taking her life.

As the wings behind him flapped, Lin Yun disappeared. When he reappeared before an old man, three thousand purple-golden dragon runes began to blaze in his palm and a crimson dragon claw instantly crossed a few thousand meters, crushing that old man as easily as an ant.

In a split second, there were only three out of the eight Greater Elysium Core Realm experts left, and they had completely panicked now. They no longer dared to stay behind and wanted to escape.

“None of you can escape!” Lin Yun roared and the golden crow and silver phoenix holy spirits turned into great yin and great yang before entering his body and fusing into primitive chaos, unleashing the last form of the Divine Solar Lunar Fist—Eternal Light.

When Lin Yun threw his punch, he unleashed the light of eternity. The surroundings plunged into darkness, but that only lasted for a split second before light returned. It even gave others a misperception that the darkness didn’t exist earlier. Just like that, the three Greater Elysium Core Realm experts disappeared, turned into ashes under Lin Yun’s attack.

Standing in mid-air, Lin Yun’s silver hair fluttered in the wind, making him look like an immortal who walked out of the moon. The two paintings behind him also emitted an invincible aura that instantly made him seem unbelievably strong.

As for those who were observing this battle, they were so shocked that they couldn’t utter a single word. At this moment, they finally knew how strong Flower Burial, the strongest champion of the Heavenly Path, was!
