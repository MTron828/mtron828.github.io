Chapter 1874 - Sword Intent Beyond Heavenly Dome

Lin Yun followed Ye Guhan’s instructions and released his Sword Heart. When he circulated the Sword Heart, the Sword Heart that should be invisible gathered to form a lump of light within his chest. It was in the form of a small pellet, and it was beating like a heart.

Lin Yun could feel his Heavenly Dome Sword Intent filling his body, and he could ‘see’ everything within a hundred-mile radius down to the microscopic level. He quickly closed his eyes to sense it. If he had to face dangers in the future; he would be able to sense it beforehand.

The Sword Heart was miraculous, and no martial techniques could reach the same effects as the Sword Heart. Even if he possessed a secret technique, he still wouldn’t be able to control it as he wished, unlike the Sword Heart.

At the same time, the surrounding spiritual energy was endlessly being devoured by the Sword Heart. This allowed him to make another breakthrough at the Profound Death Stage.

Seeing this, Ye Guhan smiled, “I’m really envious of your talent in the sword. Sword Heart is something that many people fail to grasp even after reaching the Saint Realm. You can release it now.”

With a thought, Lin Yun released the Sword Heart.

“Do you know what Sword Heart represents?” Ye Guhan asked.

“A little.” Lin Yun replied. “Only those who have grasped the Sword Heart can be called a Sword Saint, just like Senior Brother. Only by grasping the Sword Heart can one grasp the sword domain. Sword Heart differs from Sword Intent, requiring a high level of talent in the sword path.”

“That’s right.” Ye Guhan nodded. “But you managed to grasp the Sword Heart while at the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent. Our master, Mu Xuankong, and I had grasped the Sword Heart after our sword intent reached the sixth grade because only those whose sword intent reached the seventh grade could grasp the sword domain. From this alone, your talent in the sword is even stronger than Junior Brother Jingtian.”

As he spoke, Ye Guhan held onto his chin with difficulty written on his face.

“Senior Brother, what’s the matter?” Lin Yun asked.

“Your situation is a little special. If I teach you how to cultivate your Sword Heart, it’s equivalent to using Nirvana Stage’s means in the Dragon Pulse Realm. But you don’t have any nirvana aura. Do you know what I mean?” Ye Guhan smiled.

“I roughly understand now,” Lin Yun nodded.

“But it’s a waste if I don’t teach you,” Ye Guhan smiled.

“Senior Brother, what’s the sword intent beyond Heavenly Dome?” Lin Yun asked.

“Oh? Why are you asking about it?” Ye Guhan asked curiously.

“Senior Brother, you can teach me that first so that I can cultivate my Sword Heart after my sword intent makes a breakthrough.” Lin Yun said.

Ye Guhan was stumped when he heard that, and he smiled, “Junior Brother, are you joking?”

Lin Yun didn’t waste any words with him and released his Heavenly Dome Sword Intent at complete mastery. The Flower Burial Sword also flew out and coiled around him when he released his sword intent.

As waves of powerful sword aura swept out, it began to lap over him and formed into thirty-six layers, which meant he was one with his sword.

“You…” Ye Guhan blankly stared at Lin Yun because he didn’t expect Lin Yun’s Heavenly Dome Sword Intent to reach complete mastery.

Lin Yun sheathed his sword and dispersed his sword intent before looking at Ye Guhan with anticipation.

A brief moment later, Ye Guhan said, “The sword intent beyond Heavenly Dome is Astral. Putting it in a nutshell, you can use sword intent to absorb the power of the stars, but you can only comprehend it by yourself. After breaking through the shackles of thirty-six layers of heaven, the sword intent can absorb astral energy and be converted into the Astral Sword Intent before manifesting into an astral ocean and ultimately a star.”

Lin Yun’s heart throbbed when he heard that, and he soon thought of Jian Jingtian’s sword intent. His senior brother’s sword intent was massive, like a bright star. Jian Jingtian’s sword intent probably reached the Astral Sword Intent.

“As for how to achieve it, you can only rely on yourself. I can’t help you with it. But I can share with you how to cultivate it.” Ye Guhan sat on the ground and shared his understanding of sword dao with Lin Yun.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

As for the Divine Firefly Sword, Ye Guhan personally performed it. With that, Ye Guhan took the role of his master during this period of time, giving Lin Yun all sorts of guidance. This included the Profound Lightning Sword Technique and Carefree 9 Swords.

The martial brothers practiced swords throughout this period. They would either clash swords or chat, or Lin Yun would practice his sword while Ye Guhan watched from the side.

Before they realized it, half a month had passed. On this day, Ye Guhan sighed, “It’s time for me to leave now. You can stay in the Heavenly Dao Sect and wait for my return.”

“Senior Brother, what’s the difference between a holy land and a powerful sect?” Lin Yun asked.

Ye Guhan already knew that Lin Yun would ask him this. After all, every Sword Sect disciple would swear to bring the Sword Sect to become a holy land one day.

“You’ll know if you go there.” Ye Guhan said.

Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts upon hearing what Ye Guhan said. It was just as Ye Guhan said; it was time for him to go to the Heavenly Dao Sect.

After Ye Guhan left, Lin Yun took out the portrait and began to observe it. It wasn’t an issue for him to change his appearance with the Divine Tortoise Transformation, but his temperament was a problem. Anyone could tell that Ye Qingtian was from a powerful clan, and this was reflected in his arrogance.

His temperament was completely different from Lin Yun, so Lin Yun spent seven days trying to grasp a hint of Ye Qingtian’s temperament. He had also taken on Ye Qingtian’s appearance. To be honest, Ye Qingtian’s skin was as pearly white as a woman's skin, which simply made him look like a pretty boy.

“Anyone can tell from this face that this person needs a beating.” Lil’ Purple commented.

“That’s right.” Lin Yun replied.

“Ha, I can tell from a glance that this face belongs to a scumbag. Speaking of which, what did this fellow do to be kicked out from the sect? Since he’s already expelled, how can he return?” Lil’ Purple asked.

Lin Yun looked at the portrait and shook his head, “It’s not written on the portrait. Senior Brother only told me that he’s been expelled for a year, and a year has passed now.”

“Who knows, perhaps he peeked on an elder while they were bathing.” Lil’ Purple speculated.

Lin Yun’s face became dark upon hearing that, before ignoring Lil’ Purple. He began to study Ye Qingtian’s information. Ye Qingtian was a direct descendant of the Ye Clan and was the same age as Lin Yun. This was an arrogant person, but he feared the strong and only bullied the weak. During his time within the inner sect, he had violated the sect’s rules, and would have been permanently expelled from the sect if he wasn’t a direct descendant of the Ye Clan.

This instantly gave Lin Yun a headache, and he began wondering why Ye Qingtian was expelled.

“Let’s go.” Lin Yun stowed the portrait and activated his movement technique, heading towards the Heavenly Dao Sect.

Half a day later, a spacious ground with a bustling city appeared before him. This city was at least the scale for millions of people. In this place were ten such cities, which was the outer sect of the Heavenly Dao Sect.

Lin Yun was shocked that a holy land’s scale could reach this far. This was still under the condition that the Heavenly Dao Sect had restrained themselves. If one included their subsidiary forces, the sheer number of people would reach a terrifying height.

When the Heavenly Dao Sect was flourishing, the Heavenly Dao Sect’s forces covered the entire Eastern Desolation with a branch everywhere, and each branch was comparable to a holy land. Just the fact that they could use ‘Heavenly Dao’ as their sect’s name alone was enough to prove how glorious they once were.

There were rumours that the decline of the Heavenly Dao Sect was related to the Nine Emperors. Even so, no one dared to underestimate the Heavenly Dao Sect within the Eastern Desolation, which held a heavy weight within the entire Kunlun Realm.

Within the various cities, many outer disciples would interact with each other, exchanging their resources. Many inner disciples would also often visit these ten cities as well.

When Lin Yun entered a city under the appearance of Ye Qingtian, he saw many Heavenly Dao Sect disciples, and he soon differentiated them between the outer and inner disciples. But he had no idea where to go and could only follow behind a group of inner disciples.

It wasn’t long before Lin Yun saw a familiar person, Xiao Yuanqi. This was an old acquaintance, and they met several times within the Black Tortoise Void Sea. When the Ming Cult placed him in a difficult position, Xiao Yuanqi and Ji Lingfeng didn’t hesitate to stand out for him. Strictly speaking, he owed Xiao Yuanqi one.

Xiao Yuanqi was currently leading a group of inner disciples through the city, and they were all donning azure robes. Their cultivations were at the Profound Life Stage. Lin Yun naturally changed his objective and was following this group of people.

“Senior Brother, I think I saw Ye Qingtian.” A person whispered to Xiao Yuanqi.

Xiao Yuanqi’s face changed when he heard that, and he turned around.

When Lin Yun saw that he was discovered, he could only wear a smile and speak out, “What a coincidence to run into Senior Brother Xiao when I’m returning to the sect.”

“You really dare to return!” Xiao Yuanqi snorted with disdain.

Lin Yun was briefly stunned when he heard that.

“I’m surprised that he has the guts to return.”

“I have no idea where this sissy got the face to come back from…” The inner disciples all looked at Lin Yun with disdain.

“Senior Brother, shall we teach him a lesson?” Someone suggested.

“Don’t bother with him. We’re not from the same peak as him.” Xiao Yuanqi couldn’t be bothered with Lin Yun and left with everyone following after him.

This naturally made Lin Yun depressed, but he could only follow behind with a smile on his face right now.
