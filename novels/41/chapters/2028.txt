Chapter 2029 - Chase Up To Me

Everyone in the arena fell silent when Ye Qingtian unleashed his Astral Sword Intent, and they were deeply shocked. But shortly after, Ye Qingtian’s sword pierced through the Quasi-Saint with his sword intent shining, and the Quasi-Saint’s body blew apart.

Jin Xuanyi and Zhang Ziling were headed, and their corpses were left behind. But the Quasi-Saint died without a complete corpse left behind.

Everyone was briefly shocked for a moment before cheers echoed with disbelief filling everyone’s pupils.

“H-How is this possible?” Jiu Yang’s face became pale, looking at the terrible death of his junior brother.

Shi Feng said, “If your Ming Cult doesn’t explain this matter, our Heavenly Dao Sect won’t let you guys off so easily.”Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Jiu Yang’s face was terrifyingly ugly, and he no longer had the smugness on his face. His face was pale, with his lips trembling. Due to the special circumstances of the God Burial Mountain Range, it was troublesome to nurture a Quasi-Saint, and Jiu Yang would have to take huge responsibility for a Quasi-Saint’s death.

“Come on, then. You think the Ming Cult is afraid of you guys?” Jiu Yang didn’t want to stay here for another second. So he immediately left after saying that.

As for all the geniuses on the King Ranking who were present, their eyes became dim, and their pupils were filled with helplessness. The commotion caused by Jin Xuanyi was huge, and many geniuses on the King Ranking were present, wanting to challenge him in the arena.

They were confident when they came but couldn’t muster the courage to fight when they looked at Ye Qingtian in the arena. They even had a hint of fear within their pupils when they looked at Ye Qingtian.

Initially, everyone didn’t believe that Jin Xuanyi used his full strength, and that Ye Qingtian merely took the opportunity to kill Jin Xuanyi. Ye Qingtian declared that anyone could challenge him if his strength didn’t convince them, but no one dared to go to the arena after Zhang Ziling and the Quasi-Saint’s death.

“Astral Sword Intent… It’s no wonder why he’s so strong…” Qu Duan said weakly.

Li Yanxian’s face was pale, and he felt powerless. As a swordsman, he knew better than Qu Duan how strong the Astral Sword Intent was. Li Yanxian might’ve reached Quasi-Astral Sword Intent, but he wasn’t confident of taking that half step out, even if he reached the Saint Realm.

Since Ye Qingtian possessed Astral Sword Intent, it now made sense why he could slay an Azure Origin Phase Quasi-Saint with his cultivation at the seventh transformation of the Nirvana Stage.

“Brother Li, what do you think of him?” Qu Duan asked.

Li Yanxian fell silent and said, “He’s invincible.”

Qu Duan was speechless when he heard that.

Lin Yun briefly stayed in the arena until the host gave the Divine Blood Flower to him after seeing that no one wanted to come into the arena. Since Six Holy City had a powerful background, even Jin Xuanyi did not dare to fool them with a fake Divine Blood Flower. He dared to hand the real Divine Blood Flower over because of the confidence in his strength. But it was a pity that he had overestimated himself.

With that, the new champion of the King Ranking appeared. No one dared to suspect Ye Qingtian’s strength any longer, and this meant Ye Qingtian had become first and was the unrivaled king on the King Ranking.

Anyone could foresee that it wouldn’t take long for Ye Qingtian’s name to spread throughout the Eastern Desolation.

“Big Brother Ye succeeded! You killed Jin Xuanyi and retrieved the Divine Blood Flower. When we return to the Heavenly Dao Sect, you will surely receive a heavy reward for it!” Bai Qingyu came forth and welcomed Lin Yun with excitement.

Xin Yan, Wang Muyan, Wang Yue, Chen Zhong, and the other geniuses of the Heavenly Dao Sect also stepped forth to cup their fists together.

After all, Ye Qingtian had become first on the King Ranking. It would make him famous within the Eastern Desolation, and Ye Qingtian could also obtain a decent amount of glory.

Wang Muyan smiled, “See what I said? I believed that Ye Qingtian could win. After all, he’s an unprecedented genius swordsman of the Heavenly Dao Sect!”

Wang Yue smiled, “I didn’t believe it in the past, but I’m convinced now.”

Everyone stepped forth to congratulate and flatter Ye Qingtian. On the other hand, Nangong Fuye was filled with emotions, and he looked at Ye Qingtian with a complicated gaze. Ye Qingtian was a nobody a year ago, but he forged such a reputation for himself in just half a month. This was simply too unbelievable.

Lin Yun and Xin Yan exchanged a gaze before his gaze fell onto Wang Muyan, wanting to detect the slightest change on her face.

“Hehe. Junior Brother Ye, why are you looking at me? You’re making me feel embarrassed,” Wang Muyan smiled charmingly.

“Junior Sister Wang, you’re really ‘good-hearted,’” Lin Yun said.

Wang Muyan smiled, “That’s for sure. I understand your the best within the Heavenly Dao Sect. If you’re willing, I’ll let Junior Brother see how good-hearted I am.”

Seeing the smile on Wang Muyan’s face, Lin Yun could only admit that she had hidden herself really deeply.

“Let’s not talk about that for now and deliver the Divine Blood Flower back to the sect,” Shi Feng said.

Lin Yun nodded and gave the Divine Blood Flower to Xin Yan to keep. The Divine Blood Flower would naturally go to the sect, so Lin Yun wasn’t interested.

At night, the Heavenly Dao Sect’s group stayed within the Heavenly Dao Sect’s branch. The Six Holy City was massive, and the city was a safe zone within the God Burial Mountain Range. There was an altar at the city’s heart with a stone monument reaching a thousand feet, and the branches of the six holy lands were built around it.

At this moment, Lin Yun was in Xin Yan’s room. He fell into deep thoughts with the candle’s light reflected on his face. The light from the candle outlined Xin Yan’s exquisite features and made her stand out even more.

Xin Yan smiled, “Ye Qingtian, it has been fifteen minutes since you came to my room. Stop beating around the bush. What do you want to say?”

Lin Yun finally came to a decision and raised his head, “I do have something to tell Senior Sister, and it’s something important.”

Hearing what he said, Xin Yan was briefly stunned before she smiled, “What’s the matter?”

“It’s related to Wang Muyan,” Lin Yun said.

A hint of disappointment flashed across Xin Yan’s pupils when she heard that. This was because she had a familiar feeling coming from Ye Qingtian, especially what Ye Qingtian said before going to the arena. This familiar figure existed from her first meeting with Ye Qingtian.

Although she had her speculation, she didn’t dare to confirm it, fearing that she would be greatly disappointed. So she thought Ye Qingtian would speak up by coming to her room tonight. Thus, she was disappointed that Ye Qingtian spoke about Wang Muyan instead.

“As expected of you, Ye Qingtian. I have long heard that you have an ambiguous relationship with the Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden, and it looks like the rumors are true,” Xin Yan smiled, keeping the disappointment in her heart.

Lin Yun took a deep breath and said, “I’m practically confident that Wang Muyan is in cahoots with the Blood Moon Sect. She might even be Blood Moon Sect’s Holy Maiden or Divine Maiden!”

The Blood Moon Sect’s Divine Maiden would be promoted from the competition amongst Holy Maidens. The moment the Divine Maiden appears, the remaining Holy Maidens would become the Divine Maiden’s maids.

“What do you mean by that?” Xin Yan’s smile disappeared, and she continued, “This is a serious accusation, and you need to provide evidence for that.”

Lin Yun didn’t hesitate to share what he experienced within the Myriad Graves Valley with Xin Yan.

“What?!” Xin Yan exclaimed. “You killed Ye Qinghong, Zhang Kui, and Xiao Jingyan?!”

Lin Yun nodded and even shared with Xin Yan about the Indigocloth Venerable. Then again, he naturally wouldn’t say that Xiao Jingyan was a Demonspirit. This information was too dangerous, and it wasn’t convenient for him to share it with Xin Yan.

“This is unbelievable…” Xin Yan was in disbelief when she heard that.

“Senior Sister, you don’t believe me?” Lin Yun asked.

“I believe you,” Xin Yan said without any hesitation.

“Then…” Lin Yun said.

But he was disrupted by Xin Yan before he could even finish what he wanted to say. Xin Yan said, “But you don’t have any evidence of that, not to mention you killed everyone. Even if the Indigocloth Venerable was real, Wang Muyan can say you’re accusing her.”

Lin Yun naturally understood what Xin Yan said, and he nodded, “This is why I’m here to discuss it with you.”

Xin Yan fell into deep thoughts before she asked, “Something isn’t right. Why is she doing all this? If she wants to be unfavorable to you, she can just let Jin Xuanyi kill you, so there’s no need for Jin Xuanyi to set up an arena and make it known to everyone.”

“I plan to ask her about that,” Lin Yun said.

“You want to ask her about it?” Xin Yan immediately guessed what Lin Yun was planning.

Lin Yun nodded and replied, “I plan to capture her tonight and ask her about it. The God Burial Mountain Range doesn’t allow any Quasi-Saints to enter, so this is the perfect opportunity.”

After all, one wouldn’t know if Wang Muyan would have Quasi-Saint bodyguards once she leaves the God Burial Mountain Range or even Saint Realm experts.

“How do you want me to help you?” Xin Yan asked.

“I need you to go with me if she accuses me of anything. I’ll have you as a witness at that time,” Lin Yun said. He continued, “If possible, I also need Senior Sister to prevent her from escaping.”

Lin Yun was enough to deal with Wang Muyan but needed Xin Yan’s help to ensure success.

“Alright,” Xin Yan nodded. She continued, “I have long noticed that there’s something wrong with her. She was suddenly captured in the treehouse inn and forced me to hand the Divine Blood Flower over. After that, she took the initiative to go to the Myriad Graves Valley to look for you, which was weird.”

Xin Yan had already sensed something was wrong with Wang Muyan, but Wang Muyan was the Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden and princess of the Wang Clan. So no one would suspect she was someone from the Blood Moon Sect.

“When are we going to make a move?”

“Now.”

“Okay.” Lin Yun and Xin Yan were decisive people, and they immediately made a move when they came to a decision, both heading towards Wang Muyan’s room.

“Senior Sister, I’ll go in, so you can just wait for me outside,” Lin Yun said. He felt that Wang Muyan had hidden her true self rather deeply, and she didn’t seem that simple despite her cultivation at the fourth transformation of the Nirvana Stage. It would be terrible if Xin Yan was injured when they fought.

“Just call me if you need help,” Xin Yan nodded without hesitation. Ye Qingtian was now first on the King Ranking, and not even an Azure Origin Phase Quasi-Saint could be his opponent. There was no need for her to be concerned about his safety.

“Ye Qingtian, you previously told me that you have a senior sister. Can you tell me more about her?” Xin Yan ultimately couldn’t hold herself from asking this just when Ye Qingtian was about to enter the room.

“Senior Sister, why are you suddenly asking about her?” Lin Yun asked.

“Regardless if you think you’ve done something wrong, your senior sister will always forgive you. Have you seen an elder sister blaming her younger brother before?” Xin Yan smiled with a wink.

Lin Yun was briefly stunned when he heard that, then entered the room. But when he took two steps forth, the door closed by itself. Lin Yun examined the room and saw Wang Muyan holding onto her chin, reading a book. She had an indolent expression with her exquisite facial features reflected by the light.

“Ye Qingtian, I have been waiting for you,” Wang Muyan smiled.

“We should talk,” Lin Yun said with murderous intent flashing across his pupils and his sword intent spread out.

“Astral Sword Intent… You have really surprised me and ruined all of my plans,” Wang Muyan sighed.

“So, it’s really you!” Lin Yun’s pupils flashed with unconcealable murderous intent.

Wang Muyan pitifully said, “Ye Qingtian, you want to kill me when we had such a beautiful past together? There are really no good men in the world.”

“What are you planning? If you’re honest with me, I can consider letting you go,” Lin Yun said.

Wang Muyan sneered, “You’ll let me go? But I have no intention of letting you go. Do you want to kill me? Let’s talk about it if you can catch me. If you can catch me, I can fulfill your request.”

As chimes resounded, a red cloth flew out from Wang Muyan with a wave of her hand, destroying the restriction of sword intent and disappearing into the darkness.

The door was opened right at this moment, and Xin Yan asked with a frown when she saw the hole in the roof. She said, “It might be a trap.”

“Senior Sister, you stay here. I’ll go and take a look.” Lin Yun’s face was cold because leaving such a threat like Wang Muyan around was too dangerous. The God Burial Mountain Range was the perfect opportunity to kill her. This was because once Wang Muyan leaves the God Burial Mountain Range, finding another opportunity to kill her would be tough.
