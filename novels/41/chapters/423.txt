Chapter 424 - Terrifying

Combining the Undying Vajra Seal, Sky Breaking Seal, and Demon Vanquishing Seal together, Lin Yun’s aura approached the Violet Palace Realm as he sent the demonic beast flying with a single punch. Simultaneously, a dragon and a tiger roared out from Lin Yun as he brimmed with an aura of dominance.

The ground trembled and the demonic beast could no longer get back up on its feet. Lin Yun’s clothes were also tattered and stained with blood from his injuries. It wasn’t an easy win for Lin Yun since he didn’t use his sword.

The demonic beast might not be in its strongest state, but its defence was too terrifying. It was comparable to a cosmic artifact, which forced Lin Yun to exert a great deal of effort to kill it. Even with the Seven Profound Steps, Dracophant Battle Physique, and the Dragon-Tiger Fist, he took half a day to kill it.

“There’s a reason why it can reach the Violet Palace Realm. It cannot be underestimated despite being heavily injured,” muttered Lin Yun as he looked at the corpse. This battle had strengthened his understanding for demonic beasts in the Violet Palace Realm.

But a demonic beast in the Violet Palace Realm was different from a cultivator. Cultivators had cultivation techniques, martial techniques, and various trump cards. Cultivators could suppress demonic beasts at the same cultivation, unless they ran into mutated demonic beasts or those with ancient bloodline inheritance from divine beasts. Those demonic beasts were monarchs among those at the same cultivation level and they were extremely terrifying.

This demonic beast might have a terrifying defence, but it wasn’t even an overlord demonic beast. This meant that Lin Yun still had a long way to go. After a brief rest, Lin Yun walked towards the corpse and retrieved the beast core. He might be a delicacy in the eyes of demonic beasts, but the demonic beasts’ beast core was also equally tempting to him.

But when he arrived at the corpse, his face suddenly changed and he turned around. There was a black leopard squatting on a rock a hundred meters away that was looking at him. In that split second, Lin Yun felt a chill run down his spine and his back was instantly covered in sweat. He didn’t realize the leopard’s arrival at all.

But the most bizarre thing was that this leopard had a small body. It was barely two meters long, unlike the demonic beast he just killed. But the small body had placed Lin Yun under great pressure, and made him feel fearful at the same time. His limbs weren’t listening to him.

Is the leopard warning me that the crimson four legged beast was its prey? Lin Yun tried his best to keep his composure as he distanced himself from the four legged beast.

The leopard jumped down from the rock and strolled forward. The whole time it walked, its eyes were glued to Lin Yun. Suddenly, it stretched its jaws like it was smiling.

In the next second, the leopard disappeared and reappeared before Lin Yun. Lin Yun was shocked by the leopard speed and he instantly spread his arms like a crow.

However, he still took a claw to his chest. The pain made Lin Yun’s lips twitch. He instantly realized that this was a genuine Violet Palace Realm demonic beast, unlike the one he killed previously that had already been weakened after losing so much blood.

“Interesting…” Lin Yun smirked after he recovered from his fear and unleashed boundless fighting spirit. He circulated the Iris Sword Sutra and his figure became like a sword plunged into the ground. His hair and clothes fluttered in the wind as he stared at the leopard.

The leopard suddenly opened its jaws and unleashed a roar, releasing the origin energy within its body in the manner of a sound wave towards Lin Yun. Under the soundwave, Lin Yun could see ripples in the air with his naked eyes. At the same time, the leopard’s body gradually blurred because of the ripples.

Lin Yun couldn’t imagine how powerful this attack would be if he took the soundwave head-on. But he knew that even if he had a powerful physique, his internal organs would be shattered. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Combined with his origin energy, Lin Yun’s sword intent rang out from his body to release a wave of ripples as well. When the sword buzz and the soundwave clashed together, the entire mountain trembled violently under the clash, along with a series of explosions in the air. The clouds began to move and bolts of lightning flashed under their attacks.

“What’s that?” Bai Lixuan frowned his brows. He just killed the python and he was preparing to return to the sect. But his attention was attracted by the beast roar and sword buzz. “I’m going to take a look!”

Bai Lixuan turned into a streak of light and disappeared. A few minutes later, he stopped on a tree and infused his origin energy into his eyes to watch the battle ten miles away. He could see a man and a beast fighting. The two were extremely swift and their movements would leave afterimages behind.

“It’s him!” Bai Lixuan was shocked when he saw Lin Yun. That fellow was really still alive. For some reason, Bai Lixuan felt excited instead of disappointed when he realized that Lin Yun wasn’t dead.

Perhaps he didn’t want Lin Yun to be killed by demonic beasts because in the depths of his heart he knew it would be a pity. He could tell that Lin Yun had gained a lot through this experience since his movement techniques alone were impressive.

But Lin Yun didn’t seem to be in a good condition as he was covered in injuries. Several of his injuries even went deep into his bones. The leopard’s claw was powerful and could easily tear a cultivator in the tenth stage into pieces. Even with the Dracophant Battle Physique, Lin Yun couldn’t take the attacks head-on.

“There’s something weird about this Demon Runic Leopard…” Bai Lixuan frowned his eyebrows because he had never seen such a small Demon Runic Leopard. It had a sleek body and its agility wasn’t any inferior to a spiritual grade movement technique.

Bai Lixuan’s hand was resting on his sword without him realizing. At the same time, the sword intent within his body was also on the verge of erupting. But a moment later, he removed his hand from the hilt. He looked at Lin Yun and muttered to himself, “You’re not worthy of fighting me if you can’t even get through this ordeal. So why should I save you?”

Bai Lixuan disappeared from the spot in the next second. Now that he could kill a Violet Palace Realm demonic beast, there was no reason for him to stay in the mountain range. He wanted to return to the sect to spar with Violet Palace Realm elders.

Demonic beasts and cultivators couldn’t be compared to each other. After all, the latter had more means. But just when Bai Lixuan began to move, he froze.

If he’s going to be killed, it would be better to die by my sword. At least this way you won’t lose your dignity as a swordsman. Bai Lixuan finally found a reason to convince himself. Without any hesitation, he turned around and returned to where he was previously.

When he returned, his face was odd because he expected that Lin Yun would still be struggling against the demonic beast. But in reality, Lin Yun was still fighting with the leopard without showing any signs of being weakened. On the contrary, his fighting spirits blazed like wildfire.

Just when Bai Lixuan was shocked, he saw a boundless aura exploding from Lin Yun’s body like a volcanic eruption. Lin Yun was forming an odd seal with both his hands and when he pushed the seal out, the leopard was sent flying away. It was the Undying Vajra Seal.

However, Lin Yun didn’t just stop there and he continued to form more seals. He quickly formed the Sky Breaking Seal, the Demon Vanquishing Seal, and the Heavenly Seal.

Each seal was stronger than the previous one. When he formed the Heavenly Seal, the thirty-three swords behind him opened up in a fan formation and his boundless sword aura rose to a suffocating height.

The Heavenly Seal slammed into the Demon Runic Leopard, who was now wailing out in pain, sending it into the air and then onto the ground. When it was slammed to the ground, it released a miserable shriek along with blood that splattered everywhere.

The Demon Runic Leopard let out a ferocious roar and its body began to grow in size, releasing a terrifying demonic aura. It no longer looked as elegant as it did before.

“Great!” Lin Yun’s eyes lit up and he began to speed up the process of forming the seals. When the Undying Vajra Seal, Sky Breaking Seal, and the Demon Vanquishing Seal combined together, Lin Yun’s aura reached the Violet Palace Realm, but it didn’t stop there because he was forming the fourth seal.

“Four seals combine!” Lin Yun could feel his body being torn apart when the four seals combined together. Blood began to ooze out from his skin and he wore a savage expression on his face.

Lin Yun didn’t even think for a second before slamming all that explosive energy onto the Demon Runioc Leopard, tearing it into pieces before it could even launch an attack after increasing its size.

After the rain of blood settled down, Bai Lixuan looked at Lin Yun dropping to one knee since all his origin energy was exhausted. He was shocked. He naturally guessed that Lin Yun was taking a risk by squeezing out his potential. At this moment, he knew how the youth managed to build up fame in the Sword Firmament Pavilion in such a short period of time.

“How terrifying…” Bai Lixuan shook his head and left.
