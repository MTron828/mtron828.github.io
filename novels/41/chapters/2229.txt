Chapter 2230 - Crook

Ji Feng trembled under Lin Yun’s question. That was too much, but he didn’t dare to reply. Regardless of the Ying River King or the Asura Dove King, they weren’t existences he could afford to provoke, and they could easily kill him with one finger. Seeing Ji Feng’s reaction, Lin Yun smiled.

The three Demonspirits on the Sword Mound were all second-stage Saint Lords and had long condensed their dipper auras. In addition to their identity as the Demonspirit Clan, the three were comparable to five Horizon Hawk Saint Lords, at the very least.

“You go lure one of them away. If you can survive, I’ll give you a droplet of divine blood,” Lin Yun gave his promise as he looked at Ji Feng.

“You have divine blood with you?” Ji Feng’s eyes lit up. His strength could be greatly boosted if he had divine blood.

“Not right now, but that doesn’t mean I won’t have it in the future.” Lin Yun didn’t have any divine blood with him. He did have a droplet of the Heavenly Dragon’s blood, but that was even rarer than divine blood.

Just when Ji Feng wanted to refute what Lin Yun said, Lin Yun said as he reached out with a bottle in his hand, “This is 50 kilograms of True Dragon Saint Liquid, and you can take it now if you agree to it.”

Ji Feng’s face changed, and he swallowed his words back down. He said, “You said it. You’ll give me divine blood if I manage to come back alive?”

He didn’t care about any divine blood right now. He only wanted Lin Yun to lift the restrictions that were on him and run after taking the True Dragon Saint Liquid. The worst case scenario would be killed, which was better than being refined into a bead or used to refine a sword.

“Okay, I’ll promise you. But you have to undo my restriction first,” Ji Feng said, gritting his teeth.

“Don’t resist.” Lin Yun placed his finger on Ji Feng’s forehead and circulated the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra, injecting his nether energy into Ji Feng’s body.

There was a Netherflower in Ji Feng’s sea of consciousness, spreading its vines like shackles. When Lin Yun took his hand back, he extracted a flower out from Ji Feng’s forehead.

When the restriction was lifted, a crimson light flashed in Ji Feng’s eyes, indicating that he had recovered his cultivation and the ferocity of a Blood Crow. He ferociously looked at Lin Yun and couldn’t help recalling his grievance, being enslaved by a Quasi-Saint.

“Little Crow, what are you trying to do?” Lil’ Red slapped Ji Feng on his head.

“I’m just joking. I’ll do whatever you want me to…” Ji Feng immediately cowered as he reached out to take the crystal bottle. He had thought it through, wanting to leave after taking the True Dragon Saint Liquid. As for whether he could lure a Demonspirit away, he couldn’t be bothered about that.

But he failed to grab onto anything as Lin Yun pulled back his hand, and this made Ji Feng look at Lin Yun in confusion.

“If you go like this, it’s no different from courting death. You see the Saint Realm demonic corpses around them?” Lin Yun smiled.

Ji Feng scratched his head because he was only focused on running and didn’t pay attention.

Lin Yun didn’t expose Ji Feng, but revealed his plan instead, “You lure the other Blood Crows in the Asura Dove King’s territory over. Tell them that the Asura Dove King is injured, and these three Demonspirits did it.”

Lin Yun already noticed that the Asura Dove King didn’t want to disrupt the three Demonspirits, so he didn’t bring his subordinates over.

“H-How can I possibly do that? We might be Blood Crows, but there’s a huge difference between us, and our voices are also different,” Ji Feng cowered.

“Figure it out yourself. There are many ways, and if you didn’t help out when I kept you around so far, you would’ve lost your value to live,” Lin Yun said, giving Ji Feng a chance.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“You’re not afraid that I’ll run?” Ji Feng wasn’t willing. Compared to being captured by the Asura Dove King’s subordinates, he would rather be enslaved by Lin Yun.

“Can you even escape?” Lin Yun said coldly. “I might have lifted your restriction, but I left a seed in your head. If you behave yourself, the seed will disappear in three days. If you’re not obedient, the seed will grow and tear your head apart.”

Ji Feng looked at Lin Yun with disbelief, before he quickly examined his sea of consciousness, and his face soon changed. Lin Yun really did leave a seed in his sea of consciousness, and it was even bigger than the Netherflower Lin Yun planted before.

If it wasn’t because Ji Feng didn’t resist, it would have been impossible to plant such a huge seed in his head, and he instantly knew that Lin Yun tricked him. His face paled, and he said in a trembling tone, “You’re vicious!”

“Don’t think his title as the Holy Maiden Killer is fake. You’re still too tender in comparison, so get lost.” Lil’ Purple glared at Ji Feng, threatening him.

Ji Feng’s hands trembled as he took the crystal bottle over, then soon disappeared before their eyes.

“Is that fellow reliable? He’s a little too cowardly. He might not be able to fool the Asura Dove King’s subordinates,” Lil’ Purple analyzed.

“There’s always a solution. The more cowardly he is, the higher the chance of success,” Lin Yun said calmly.

“Big Brother, we should’ve just charged over,” Lil’ Red said as it was still full of energy.

Looking at the Demonspirits on the sword mound, Lin Yun said, “If there were only three Demonspirits, they’d only be equivalent to five Horizon Hawk Saint Lords. But those Saint Realm demonic corpses cannot be underestimated, and they’re roughly the same as one Horizon Hawk Saint Lord. If we don’t find a way to create chaos, it will be hard for us to obtain the Othershore Flower.”

Lil’ Purple briefly pondered, then asked, “What if Ji Feng failed?’

“We can only leave then.” Lin Yun might be arrogant, but he was never a fool. He began to rest but was paying attention to the battle a thousand miles away. Those two were tough to deal with, and each was equivalent to at least thirty Horizon Hawk Saint Lords. He would have to pull out from this region swiftly when there's an outcome in their fight.

An hour later, chaos took place as Lin Yun opened his eyes. He indifferently said, “He succeeded.”

Lil’ Purple and Lil’ Red became energetic as they saw a group of Blood Crows at the Saint Realm rushing over, making the three Demonspirits on the sword mound frown their brows.

“Big Brother, see what I said? There’s really divine blood!” Ji Feng spoke to a Blood Crow.

This Blood Crow had a robust figure and was at least at the pinnacle second stage as a Saint Lord. Sensing the aura of divine blood coming from the Othershore Flower, he had greed reflected in his eyes, “Charge!”

“You guys are courting death!” The group of Blood Crows charged over, making the three Demonspirits furious. They left one person behind to continue injecting vitality and life force into the Othershore Flower while the two other Demonspirits left with the demonic corpses to fight with the Blood Crows.

In just a brief moment, the sword mound became chaotic, with a terrifying saint aura spreading out.

“I’ll retrieve the Othershore Flower, so you guys cover me. We’ll go separately after that,” Lin Yun said.

“Okay.” They joined the chaotic fight, and the scene became even more chaotic. But no matter how chaotic it was, the Demonspirits weren’t foolish and had ten demonic corpses guarding the Othershore Flower at all times, while a Demonspirit focused on ripening the Othershore Flower.

The Blood Crows that wanted to get close were sent flying away, throwing out blood before they could even get close.

The Demonspirit ripening the Othershore Flower was called Kui’erdo. When he saw a cat coming in his direction, he sneered, “A mere cat dares join in as well?”

With a wave of his hand, a few Saint Realm demonic corpses charged at Lil’ Red.

Lil’ Red grinned as it suddenly swelled in size, turning into an Ancient Dracoape, knocking the demonic corpses flying away. While Kui’erdo was shocked, a silver radiance shone from a little girl as an ice phoenix flew over.

While Kui’erdo fought with Lil’ Purple, Lin Yun took the chance and grabbed the Othershore Flower. But the Othershore Flower was too massive and looked like an ancient tree instead of a flower.

Bewitching voices entered Lin Yun’s ears as illusions appeared before his eyes. Light shone before his eyes, leading him in a direction. It was as though he could reach the shore if he really followed the light, but Lin Yun soon came to his senses and pulled the Othershore Flower from the ground.

As the ground cracked, Lin Yun carried the Othershore Flower and fled.

“Go!” Lil’ Purple landed on the transformed Lil’ Red and they ran in another direction.

This naturally left Kui’erdo furious, and he alternated his gaze between the two directions before chasing in Lin Yun’s direction. On the sword mound, the Blood Crows and Demonspirits were still fighting, and they were so focused on their fight that they couldn’t be bothered with the Othershore Flower.

Four hours later, Lil’ Purple and Lil’ Red had escaped far away and were no longer in the Asura Dove King’s territory. When they ensured that they were safe, Lil’ Red looked around, and said, “Big Brother doesn’t seem to be following us.”

Lil’ Purple said calmly, “That scumbag is cunning, so he won’t die. A cat has nine lives, but a scumbag has countless. Do you know why?”

Lil' Red was baffled upon hearing that. Despite what Lil’ Purple said, she was actually feeling anxious, which was reflected on her face. Suddenly, she saw a crimson radiance blooming from far away as Lin Yun appeared, carrying the Othershore Flower.

Seeing Lin Yun, Lil’ Purple’s eyes lit up, and she rejoiced, “Look, the scumbag is here.”

When the three joined up, they began to discuss what they should do with the Othershore Flower. Lin Yun helplessly said, “It seems to be alive, and it’s resisting entering the Iris Secret Realm.”

This was why he had to carry the Othershore Flower and couldn’t stow it, which would be more convenient.

“That’s bad news. We still have to find a way to ripen it,” Lil’ Purple said.

“Crush it, then.” Lin Yun said without any hesitation, wanting to draw his sword. Only the Flower Burial Sword required the floral fragrance, and it shouldn’t affect it much even if the Othershore Flower wasn’t ripened.

It was too troublesome to carry it around, and the Demonspirit might catch up anytime. But the Othershore Flower seemed to have heard what Lin Yun said and began to shrink in size, looking afraid.

Lil’ Purple smiled when she saw this and said, “Lil’ Flower, be obedient. This is the famous Flower Burial. If you’re not obedient, then he might become ruthless.”

When Lin Yun tried it this time, he managed to smoothly put the Othershore Flower into the Iris Secret Realm.

“Lin Yun, you’re really a crook. The Blood Crow is so afraid of you, and even the Othershore Flower is afraid of you.” Lil’ Purple laughed.

Lin Yun didn’t hold it against her, but said, “Let’s go. I haven’t shaken that person off yet.”

“Flower Burial, why are you in such a hurry to leave when you’re here?” A laughter resounded as Kui’erdo appeared ahead of them, blocking their way.
