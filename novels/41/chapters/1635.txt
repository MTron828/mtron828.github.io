Chapter 1636 - A Mountain Of Corpses!

Lin Yun soon figured out what was going on when he looked at everyone in the surroundings being sucked over. He had long seen that massive Blue Dragon hidden within the sandstorm, emitting a terrifying divine dragon’s aura.

Spreading his Golden Crow Wings apart, a boundless sword aura swept out from him. He used his sword aura like a barrier and resisted the suction force before he yelled, “Sword Sect’s disciples, gather around me!”

Those weaker disciples were already being sucked in, but he tried to gather together as many disciples he could. After all, no one knew what would happen within the Blue Dragon Saint Palace, and it was naturally safer for them to be together.

Ye Ziling, Mu Xueqin, An Liuyan, Ye Qingxuan, Gu Ruochen, and other elites soon gathered around Lin Yun. On the other side, Qin Tian was doing the same and the top ten experts of the Profound Sky Sect have gathered around him, but Qin Tian’s face was terrifyingly dark.

“Damn it!” Killing intent began to brew within Qin Tian’s pupils, and his face became sinister. He wasn’t the same as Qin Cang. As the direct descendant of the Nether Divinity Clan and Tian Xuanzi’s disciple, Qin Cang was arrogant, but he also had a huge heart. But Qin Tian was a grudgeful person.

The Profound Sky Sect could’ve monopolized the Blue Dragon Palace, but it was all messed up now. Lin Yun ruined his plans. He would’ve already forced everyone to leave if it wasn’t for Lin Yun.

“I’ll kill you first!” Qin Tian furiously dashed towards Lin Yun.

“Let’s go!” But Lin Yun had no intention of facing Qin Tian now. He gave up resisting the suction force. Soon after, they were sucked into the air current produced by the Blue Dragon.

“Don’t let him go! Chase after him!” Qin Tian roared.

While Lin Yun was being sucked into the Blue Dragon’s jaws, his sword aura swiftly crumbled, and they were all forced to scatter by the current. After Lin Yun fell to the ground, he raised his head and saw many unbelievable palaces in this region. Each palace was massive, emitting colorful lights.

“Did everyone get separated?” Lin Yun looked around with his brows furrowed. After all, he had spent an enormous effort to gather everyone, but they were all forced to split up when they entered.

“Let’s look around, first!” Lin Yun pushed his movement technique to the limit. Since he entered the Blue Dragon Saint Palace, he naturally had to thoroughly look around.

Fifteen minutes later, the path ahead suddenly disappeared, and he was suddenly enveloped in darkness. He could feel multiple hands rising from the ground, grabbing onto his foot, trying to drag him down.

“This place is hazardous.” Lin Yun took a deep breath and stomped his foot, dashing forth.

When he landed on the ground and turned back, he saw that it was a marsh that he had just passed through, and multiple arms were rising from the swamp. This made him wonder if the arms belonged to those who had just come in. Just thinking about it made him feel a chill run down his spine.

The more he thought about it, the more he found it possible. They were trapped here for eternity and wanted to drag others along with them. After this experience, Lin Yun became more cautious during his journey.

After passing through a black fog, a purple figure walked out from a tree, holding onto the Profound Moon Fan. She was An Liuyan, and she appeared to have known that Lin Yun would be here.

“You’re waiting for me?” Lin Yun already guessed this person's identity based on her outline alone.

After An Liuyan got closer, she smiled, “Yeah. I left something on you so that I can track your location.”

“When did you put it on me?” Lin Yun asked, surprised.

“Earlier, when you carried me after I fought Qin Tian.” An Liuyan smiled.

But Lin Yun didn’t dwell on that and asked, “How much do you know about the Blue Dragon Saint Palace?”

“This is the inheritance space of the Blue Dragon Saint Palace, and there are a total of eighteen palaces, eighteen lakes, and eighteen hills, each containing a different inheritance.” An Liuyan understood more about the Ancient Barren Battlefield than Lin Yun. “Of the eighteen palaces, the dragon head palace is the main palace, and the remaining seventeen palaces are different parts of the Blue Dragon. There’s a high possibility that Qin Tian and the others will be heading to the dragon head palace because there is a high possibility that the Blue Dragon inheritance is there.”

“Why do you know so much?” Lin Yun asked.

“I have a different identity now. I have ordered the other sects of the demonic forces to search for the Blue Dragon Skybreaking Art, and they will inform me if they found anything.”

“You joined the Demon Gate?”

“Yeah.” An Liuyan nodded. She then continued, “But the strongest treasure here is the Wind God Order, a Sovereign Saint Artifact. Where the Wind God Order is located will definitely contain other treasures, and our main objective is to look for the Wind God Order now.”

Suddenly, the Blue Dragon Bone on Lin Yun’s chest emitted a faint radiance while becoming a little heated.

“Mhm?” Lin Yun and An Liuyan were both surprised.

“Can it be that your Blue Dragon Bone is related to the inheritance here?” An Liuyan stared at Lin Yun’s chest, watching the blue light slowly spread out.

“I guess so, but this is a piece of good news. The Blue Dragon Bone must’ve sensed something. So let’s gather with the others, first.” Lin Yun said. He roughly had an idea now. The Blue Dragon Bone should be related to an inheritance here, and that was his advantage that allowed him to be ahead of everyone else.

Lin Yun soon found Ye Ziling, Gu Ruochen, Mu Xueqin, Ye Qingxuan, Zhao Yan, and some of the other disciples. They were excited when they saw Lin Yun. They initially thought everyone would split up, but everyone was fine and didn’t seem to have suffered any injuries.

“Junior Brother Lin, it’s all thanks to you this time.” Ye Qingxuan said. When Lin Yun was searching for everyone, he ran into danger several times. Thus, it took him some time to look for everyone. If he had used the time to search for everyone in the saint palaces, he would already have some harvests.

With a smile, Lin Yun replied, “We’re fellow disciples of the Sword Sect. So we naturally have to search for inheritances together.”

“I won’t be coming together with you. I will gather the other disciples with Junior Brother Ji and Junior Brother Jin. There are still other fellow disciples that we have to take care of.” Ye Qingxuan suddenly spoke out.

Hearing that, everyone was surprised because anyone knew there was a high chance that they could find an inheritance together with Lin Yun, but Ye Qingxuan chose to give that up. Then again, what she said wasn’t wrong. The spirit of the saint palace’s appearance was too sudden. Many of the Sword Sect’s disciples were dragged in, and there would be other Sword Sect disciples who ran into danger here.

“All of us already have a huge harvest in the Ancient Barren Battlefield, so it’s more important for us to leave this place alive. Don’t clash with the Profound Sky Sect if you run into them.” Gu Ruochen instructed.

“Understood.” It didn’t take long for them to leave.

Just when Lin Yun was about to share the unique senses from the Blue Dragon Bone, Mu Xueqin looked at An Liuyan and asked, “Junior Brother Lin, she’s…?”

Everyone else was also looking at An Liuyan with curiosity. They weren’t acquaintances with An Liuyan, but anyone could tell that she wasn’t on the righteous path. But they could tell that she had a close relationship with Lin Yun. So they already had some doubts, especially Ye Ziling, whose gaze wasn’t friendly when she looked at An Liuyan.

An Liuyan’s identity was awkward. After all, the Demon Gate didn’t have a good reputation, and they had some grudges with every sect in the Ancient Barren Domain.

“My friend.” Lin Yun replied.

Seeing this, everyone no longer asked anything more about it, except for Ye Ziling. She took several glances at An Liuyan. Since she had a good relationship with Su Ziyao, she naturally became alert when a woman suddenly appeared beside Lin Yun.

But since it wasn’t the proper time to dwell on that right now, Lin Yun told everyone about his Blue Dragon Bone’s reaction, lighting up everyone’s eyes.

“We’ll have a huge harvest if we can obtain the Wind God Order.” Mu Xueqin said.

“Let’s go.” Lin Yun said, circulating the Blue Dragon Bone and sensing the direction in which the divine dragon bone was pointing him towards.

There were many dangerous grounds in this inheritance space, and they would lose their lives if they weren’t careful. There were also trap arrays and illusions that would be troublesome if they were caught up in them.

Lin Yun handled the arrays, while An Liuyan dealt with the illusions. Since their party wasn’t weak, their speed was swift, and it only took half an incense’s time for them to arrive before a mysterious hill.

Occasionally, the Blue Dragon Bone in his chest would emit a faint radiance and tremble. Whenever the Blue Dragon Bone shook, he could feel that his soul trembled along with it, and he could hear a draconic roar echoing by his ears.

“This is it.” Lin Yun stopped and looked at the hill up ahead. The entire hill was shrouded in death, but various saint elixirs were on the hillside.

“This is a saint mountain!” Gongsun Yan said emotionally. “They’re all saint elixirs!”

Everyone else was also shocked. Saint elixirs weren’t rare in the Ancient Barren Battlefield, but the saint elixirs growing on the hillside were extremely rare.

“Don’t be impulsive.” An Liuyan snorted with her pupils flashing coldly. When the fog on the mountain was torn apart, everyone could see multiple corpses lying on the ground.

“There’s something fishy about this place.” Mu Xueqin said.

Gu Ruochen furrowed his brows and said, “That’s right. The corpse aura here is shocking. Not only is the outside covered in corpses, but there’s something terrifying inside the mountain.”Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Did you make a mistake?” Everyone turned to look at Lin Yun. This mountain wasn’t simple, and none wanted to get close to it. They had no idea how those corpses died, and they couldn’t be sure if they wouldn’t be one of them.

“Let me give it a try.”

“Don’t!” Everyone yelled just when Lin Yun opened his mouth.

“Don’t worry. I won’t go inside.” Lin Yun smiled before he sat down. As his sword intent rumbled, a golden human flew out from his brows. It was one of Lin Yun’s sword souls. He was using his sword soul to probe the mountain. Anyone could tell Lin Yun had placed great importance on this mountain.
