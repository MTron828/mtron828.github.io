Chapter 2207: Flower Burial!

When Lin Yun said that, everyone was dumbfounded, and the plaza fell into a brief silence. Even the red-clothed youth and Star Asura King couldn’t help but look at Lin Yun.

Lin Yun had said that line multiple times during the Blue Dragon Record. It was different this time as the person holding onto the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella had changed, revealing a face everyone was familiar with.

Flower Burial might have gone missing for the past year, but his deeds and portraits were spread far and wide throughout the Kunlun Realm to the point that everyone knew about him. This was the champion of the Ninth Heavenly Path, someone who slew a Saint Lord when he was at the Dragon Pulse Realm, and there wasn’t a single person who didn’t know about him.

“It’s him…” The Dao Yang Holy Son was dumbfounded, with shock filling his eyes.

It turned out that Ye Qingtian was Lin Yun, and Lin Yun was Ye Qingtian. It was true that Ye Qingtian was Flower Burial Lin Yun!

After a brief silence, an uproar broke out on the plaza as the strongest prodigy swordsman of the Heavenly Dao Sect turned out to be the direct disciple of the Radiant Sword Saint, Flower Burial Lin Yun. This felt ridiculous, but it made sense at the same time. After all, how were there so many geniuses? Even though Ye Qingtian was already famous in the Kunlun Realm. After a brief shock, everyone’s emotions became complicated.

“So Ye Qingtian is really Flower Burial…”

“He could’ve left long ago since he wasn’t someone of my Heavenly Dao Sect. He has won my admiration.”

“He is Flower Burial, possessing courage that no one can compare to.” Although many people felt fooled, they admired and respected Lin Yun, who stayed behind in the Heavenly Dao Sect.

Bai Shuying, who was ten meters away, was dumbfounded when she looked at Lin Yun’s back figure. Her suppressed emotions finally exploded as tears welled up in her eyes.

“He said that he would come to the Heavenly Dao Sect. I knew that he would be here, but he fooled me badly.” Bai Shuying showed a gentle smile like melted ice.

The Horizon Hawk Saint Lord threw out a mouthful of blood as he struggled back on his feet. If he was only embarrassed with the Black Thunder Chains and Thunder Demon Subduing Beads, the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella broke apart his saint energy and injured him. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

There were a total of four Saint Lords who entered the plaza, but the Emperor Sword Array injured two and were sitting down to treat their injuries. As for the other Saint Lord, the Azure Scythe Saint Lord was held down by several of the Bai Clan’s Saints. Those Bai Clan’s Saints were heavily injured, but they still held down the Azure Scythe Saint Lord with their lives on the line, naturally making the latter furious.

This also meant that the Horizon Hawk Saint Lord couldn’t count on anyone else during this period.

“You’re a direct disciple of the Radiant Sword Saint, so why interfere in the affairs of the Heavenly Dao Sect? My Blood Moon Sect has no feud with your Sword Sect.” The Horizon Hawk Saint Lord said as he looked at the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella in Lin Yun’s hand. He recalled Lin Yun’s achievements and no longer looked down on the latter.

“You don’t have to worry about that. I do what I want, and you are no one to tell me what to do,” Lin Yun said indifferently. “If you want to take her, you must go through me first.”

The Horizon Hawk Saint Lord’s face sank, and he gritted, “It looks like you won’t give up until you see the coffin. Even if you have a Sovereign Saint Artifact, how much power can you bring out? It would be impressive if a Quasi-Saint like you could bring out one-hundredth of the power!”

Lin Yun smiled and raised his brow, “Why don’t you come and try it then?”

“You think I don’t dare? How ignorant!” The Horizon Hawk Saint Lord snorted and no longer held back, circulating his saint aura to the limit. He brought out his constellation, which was a flaming demonic cauldron. But that wasn’t all, his saint aura turned into indigo saint energy that enveloped him with ten-odd saint daos enveloping around him and formed into a bewitching crimson lotus. The Horizon Hawk Saint Lord coldly said, “A Sovereign Saint Artifact can kill anyone, but Lin Yun cannot. Since I know you have a Sovereign Saint Artifact, you won’t have a chance now.”

He meant that the Saint Lord Lin Yun killed before was due to luck, and that he was stronger. As a powerful aura swept out, Lin Yun felt great pressure, even while holding onto the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella, and he couldn’t help retreating.

The guy was stronger than the Saint Lord that Lin Yun had killed before, and his pressure was dazzling. If Lin Yun didn’t have a Sovereign Saint Artifact, it would be hard for him to stop the Horizon Hawk Saint Lord, even with the Azure Sword Intent, and he would be defeated in three moves.

The Horizon Hawk Saint Lord sneered as flames ignited on the demonic cauldron. The pressure forced Lin Yun down to one knee, making his face ugly.

“Flower Burial, aren’t you the direct disciple of the Radiant Sword Saint? It looks like there’s nothing impressive about you after all,” the Horizon Hawk Saint Lord smiled with a cold gaze.

“To make a Saint Lord go all out against me, I feel honored.” Lin Yun bore the pressure as he smiled.

The Horizon Hawk Saint Lord suddenly felt something wasn’t right, and saw that the runes on the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella wrre lighting up. He instantly knew that Lin Yun was trying to undo the seal of the Sovereign Saint Artifact. The more seals that were lifted, the more powerful the Sovereign Saint Artifact would become.

“You dare play tricks in front of me? You’re courting death!” The Horizon Hawk Saint Lord snorted as he held onto the ancient cauldron and threw it towards Lin Yun. In just one thought, the Horizon Hawk Saint Lord charged over with his full strength. Even if Lin Yun were a genius, he would still die, which was how powerful Saints were when facing those beneath them.

As a powerful saint aura swept out, Lin Yun felt terrible even with the Azure Dragon Divine Physique. Blood dripped from his lips, and it felt like he was about to have both his knees on the ground from the pressure.

At this moment, he wasn’t Flower Burial but someone who was gritting his teeth and pressing on.? No peerless youth was willing to become ordinary, just someone unwilling to admit defeat. He wasn’t prideful, and he just couldn’t kneel.

Just when everyone’s scalps felt numb, Lin Yun burst into laughter with one knee on the ground as the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella runes were activated. As he soared to the sky, he roared, “Oh, Azure Dragon!”

A huge chunk of his vitality and saint aura was consumed as the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella shone brightly and broke a small corner of the cauldron. This caught the Horizon Hawk Saint Lord by surprise, and the cauldron was sent flying away while Lin Yun took a few steps in mid-air.

Beyond the thirty-six layers of heaven, the Sovereign Constellation, the Azure Dragon, let out a roar with a terrifying aura unleashed from Lin Yun.

As Lin Yun let out a burst of laughter, his eyes were filled with anger and a hint of insanity. As his hair fluttered, he laughed and charged at the Horizon Hawk Saint Lord, “I am Flower Burial, burying both flowers and people alike!”

The thirty-six layers of heaven shattered as a terrifying colossus appeared above the plaza, beyond the Eastern Desolation’s heaven. A pair of eyes had looked through the layers of heaven and brought down its divine might. At this moment, a Sovereign Constellation had descended to the mortal realm.

Everyone was shocked as the legend about how Flower Burial killed a Saint Lord was going to reappear again. But this time, there wasn’t any sorrow and despair but a confident and carefree feeling.

Lin Yun dashed forth and swung the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella at the Horizon Hawk Saint Lord. It was like a long spear tearing apart the waves and appeared before the Horizon Hawk Saint Lord.

This changed the Horizon Hawk Saint Lord’s face because he never expected Lin Yun to bring out so much power of the Sovereign Saint Artifact. When he pushed his palm forth, the crimson lotus on his chest ignited with crimson flames forming into a giant palm.

Lin Yun held his umbrella and casually broke through the palm while the Horizon Hawk Saint Lord took this opportunity to escape. But Lin Yun coldly looked at the Horizon Hawk Saint Lord, “You think you can escape?”

Letting him go so easily would be too lenient on the Horizon Hawk Saint Lord. After all, he had paid a great price to use the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella. As a violent energy filled his body, he swiftly chased after the Horizon Hawk Saint Lord.

“Damn it!” The Horizon Hawk Saint Lord cursed as he discovered a pair of dragon eyes looking at him, greatly restricting him. This gave the Horizon Hawk Saint Lord no choice but to face Lin Yun head-on, and they both exchanged over ten-odd moves in the blink of an eye.

They left behind afterimages as all the various saint daos shattered. When Lin Yun and the Horizon Hawk Saint Lord separated, the saint energy around the Horizon Hawk Saint Lord was torn apart, and he was covered with injuries. He couldn’t hold on even as a saint. This was the power of a Sovereign Saint Artifact!

“Die!” Lin Yun waved his hand and descended from the sky like an Azure Dragon’s roar, charging at the Horizon Hawk Saint Lord.

The Horizon Hawk Saint Lord made his strongest move, summoning the demonic cauldron in his constellation. As the heaven and earth trembled, the demonic cauldron shattered as flames exploded like a firework, making the Horizon Hawk Saint Lord throw out a mouthful of blood as he was knocked flying a hundred meters away.

Right then, a saint radiance soared to the sky as the Azure Scythe Saint Lord, who was held down earlier, took this opportunity and charged at Bai Shuying.

Lin Yun’s face changed. He wanted to turn around to reinforce Bai Shuying.

“Haha! Flower Burial, obediently stay with me!” The Horizon Hawk Saint Lord had blood on his face, while pouncing forth like a madman.

“Oh, Azure Dragon! Please Aid Me!” Lin Yun roared as he opened the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella and sent it over to Bai Shuying’s direction.

When the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella was opened up, starlight shone down from the thirty-six layers of heaven and enveloped the entire Eastern Desolation. Everyone could see a Dragon’s Head passing through the crack when they raised their heads.

The Azure Scythe Saint Lord that flew over was sent flying, throwing out a mouthful of blood as he rolled on the ground before he regained his footing.

Afterwards, the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella circled once before returning, and Lin Yun reacted as though he had expected this and flipped his body in mid-air. The umbrella then flew towards the Horizon Hawk Saint Lord.

The Horizon Hawk Saint Lord wanted to hold Lin Yun down, but he was surprised to see the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella as it slammed into him. This made him feel as though he had collided with an ancient cauldron, letting out a groan, and was sent flying away.

When Lin Yun was done flipping in mid-air, he landed on the top of the umbrella before he landed beside Bai Shuying with a leap.

“Come back!” Lin Yun waved his hand, and the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella returned to him. Holding onto the umbrella, he raised his brow at the Horizon Hawk Saint Lord and Azure Scythe Saint Lord.

When the Horizon Hawk Saint Lord and Azure Scythe Saint Lord got back on their feet and saw Lin Yun’s provocative expression, they nearly threw out a mouthful of blood.
