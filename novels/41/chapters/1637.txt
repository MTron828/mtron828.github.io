Chapter 1638 - Qin Tian (2)

Lin Yun already had an answer in his heart, and the reason why he came to this world must be related to the Dragon Gate. The Iris Sword Saint was a middleman that connected him with the Dragon Gate.

“If you put it that way, the Blue Dragon’s inheritance is on this mountain along with the legendary Wind God Order?!” Gongsun Yan’s eyes emotionally lit up. Everyone else was also excited when they heard what Lin Yun said. But when they looked at the mountain of corpses, they couldn’t help feeling a chill run down their spines.

“Is there a way for us to enter? Even if there aren’t any inheritances, the saint elixirs are a huge harvest as long as we can ascend it.” Gu Ruochen said.

Everyone else agreed with what he said. After all, the saint elixirs on this mountain were extremely rare, and just one of them was enough to save them a few months of cultivating outside the Ancient Barren Battlefield.

“Let me see if I can communicate with the dragon spirit. Since it injured me earlier, I should also be able to communicate with it.” Lin Yun said. “If we can climb the mountain, we can try and search for any hidden doors on the mountain, as well as saint elixirs.”

“Okay.”

When Lin Yun sat down on the mountain, he wasn’t confident in what he said earlier. But since the mountain had brought him here, he should have a chance. Thus, he circulated the Blue Dragon Bone and released a faint divine dragon’s aura.

When he closed his eyes and placed all his attention on the mountain, everyone anxiously waited for him. As time slowly passed, Lin Yun could gradually sense the existence of the dragon spirit protecting this mountain. They were both familiar with each other’s auras.

Although he couldn’t directly communicate with the dragon spirit, he could faintly sense that the dragon spirit was friendly.

“Look, the fog is gradually disappearing!” Gongsun Yan suddenly raised his hand.

When everyone raised their heads, they saw that it was just as Gongsun Yan said. The fog covering this mountain was gradually disappearing, and they could faintly see a dragon gradually appearing. That dragon was coiled up on the top of the mountain, looking at Lin Yun.

“You guys can climb the mountain.” Lin Yun said without opening his eyes.

Hearing that, everyone didn’t hesitate to climb the mountain and swiftly headed toward those saint elixirs.

“Remember to search for hidden doors, as Junior Brother Lin said.” Gu Ruochen quickly reminded.

“Got it!” Everyone replied excitedly.

“You’re not going up?” Mu Xueqin turned to look at Ye Ziling.

But Ye Ziling hugged the White Dragon Saint Sword and replied, “I’ll stay here.”

Nodding her head, Mu Xueqin turned to see that An Liuyan was also remaining behind with Ye Ziling. It didn’t take long for everyone to climb the mountain, aside from the three of them.

“Fire Ganoderma! It’s really the Fire Ganoderma!”

“This is the Dragoncloud Herb!”

While everyone else climbed the mountain, they rejoiced upon finding various saint elixirs, but they needed some effort to pick them. Saint elixirs were spiritual, to begin with. So some powerful saint elixirs would even attack those who tried to pick them.

But Gu Ruochen didn’t go after the saint elixirs and was searching the mountain. When he came halfway up the mountain, he found a wall. The wall was flat, with many plants on it. He quickly raised his hand to remove all the plants and revealed thick dirt covering the wall.

Gu Ruochen briefly hesitated before he cleaned up the dirt, and multiple paintings appeared on the wall.

“The door was here?” Gu Ruochen became even more cautious, looking at the wall. But he didn’t alarm everyone and started to decipher the paintings.

When he finally found a pattern, he noticed that the paintings all pointed in one direction. So when he reached out and gently patted that spot, the entire wall began to rumble.

Seeing this, Gu Ruochen excitedly yelled, “Junior Brother Lin, I’ve found the entrance! There’s really something special about this place!”

At the foot of the mountain, Lin Yun, who was trying to communicate with the dragon spirit, rejoiced upon hearing what Gu Ruochen said. But he didn’t open his eyes. The dragon spirit guarding this mountain was powerful, but it no longer had much intelligence left. It could only follow its instincts when it was alive, and Lin Yun could sense that it was friendly towards him. So Lin Yun was slowly trying to make it dissipate.

If he stopped here, the dragon spirit would start attacking everyone, killing everyone on the mountain, just like when his sword soul was injured earlier.

“Hahaha! I wondered why your Sword Sect didn’t go to the dragon head palace. So there’s really something fishy here!” A familiar voice resounded. This person was naturally Qin Tian of the Profound Sky Sect. Behind him, there was a huge party swiftly rushing over.

“Not good, the Profound Sky Sect is here!” Gu Ruochen’s face changed as he quickly rushed down the mountain along with everyone else.

Since Ye Ziling was the closest to them, she soared into the sky and turned into a dragon while charging at Qin Tian. When Ye Ziling got close, she drew the White Dragon Saint Sword, flicking her wrist, and unleashed eighteen snow dragons toward Qin Tian.

Each snow dragon was ten feet in size, with lightning and sword rays flickering within their pupils. When they breathed, the surrounding space distorted and was about to shatter.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Get lost!” Qin Tian snorted and unleashed waves of aura from his body. Even without making a move, he easily crushed the snow dragons.

After the snow dragons were crushed, Qin Tian pushed his palm forth, sending Ye Ziling flying while throwing out a mouthful of blood.

An Liuyan quickly stepped forth, seeing this, and resolved Qin Tian’s attack before catching Ye Ziling. But Qin Tian wasn’t bothered by the two. He was after Lin Yun. When he turned to look at the Sword Sect’s disciples rushing down the mountain, he suddenly knew what was going on and started laughing, “Hahaha! Lin Yun, even heaven wants you dead!”
