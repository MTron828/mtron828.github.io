Chapter 2453 - Ancient Barren Dragon Vein

The Radiant Sword Saint finally managed to shatter the demon that trapped him for three thousand years and became an Emperor. From today on, there would be no Radiant Sword Saint but the Radiant Sword Emperor!

When the Divine Phoenix Holy Master looked at those from the Sword Sect, he couldn’t help feeling complicated. Seven years ago, Flower Burial swiftly formed a connection with the Radiant Sword Saint when he arrived in Kunlun as the champion of the Ninth Heavenly Path and rose like a comet that couldn’t be stopped.

Today, Lin Yun has become the strongest among the younger generation, invincible among Saint Sovereigns, and could even fight those of the older generation. He was a modern generation myth! UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

As for Jian Jingtian, he was third on the three rankings two decades ago, invincible in the Eastern Desolation. Ye Guah was known as the Twin Stars of Eastern Desolation with Tian Xuanzi five centuries ago, shining brightly.

Three thousand years ago, the Nine Emperors rose to suppress the darkness, becoming mythical emperors. That resulted in Yu Qingfeng’s sword forging the current Radiant Sword Saint.

A hundred thousand years ago, one stayed while one left between the Iris Sword Saint and Azure Dragon Lord. But the two had gone in reality. One left the Kunlun Realm, while the other died a hundred thousand years ago. Then again, they didn’t escape entirely because one left behind a legend of slaying deities in the Saint Realm while the other left behind the Firmament Saint Cloth and severed the Heavenly Path.

There was a brilliant connection from a hundred thousand years ago to the present and all the karma gathered on the Sword Sect.

“It’s not easy...” The Divine Phoenix Holy Master sighed and looked at Lin Yun.

Lin Yun didn’t let down his guard. Noticing the Divine Phoenix Holy Master’s gaze, he smiled and nodded.

The Divine Phoenix Holy Master smiled. Lin Yun was in his prime, like Jian Jingtian twenty years ago, Tian Xuanzi and Ye Guhan five hundred years ago, and the Nine Emperors three thousand years ago. He now understood what Tian Xuanzi meant when he said, ‘Who's Not A Genius?.’

Radiant raised his hands as heaven and earth began trembling as the crumbled peaks began to pile up and were restored, which looked like time was reversed. This method restored even the Grand Firmament and Profound Firmament Peaks in the Sword Sect.

The Radiant Sword Emperor gave back the resources that the Sword Sect gave him to the sect. Now that he had reached the Emperor Realm with the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron and the two peaks restored, there was a chance the Sword Sect could return to becoming a holy land.

To a certain degree, the Sword Sect could now be considered a holy land.

Lin Yun asked, “Holy Master, what is master doing now?”

Even after the Sword Sect’s saint vein was restored, his master didn’t stop and continued to change the environment in the Sword Sect.

The Divine Phoenix Holy Master explained, “He’s using the remaining heavenly dao energy to increase the grade of the saint vein to lay the foundation of the Sword Sect becoming a holy land. Even emperors can’t obtain heavenly dao energy easily, and he naturally can’t waste them.”

“What is my master’s strength now that he became an Emperor?” Lin Yun asked. He was curious about his master’s strength after reaching the Emperor Realm.

The Divine Phoenix Holy Master said, “Based on the phenomenon of your master’s tribulation, those who managed to pass it all became a mythical emperor. If the Heavenly Path is reforged, they can easily reach the Deity Realm. But now that he just became an Emperor, he didn’t have time to stabilize his cultivation. If he could take time to comprehend becoming an Emperor, his strength would be greatly boosted.”

Hearing that, Lin Yun rejoiced and asked, “That’s great! But I’m afraid the Empress won’t let my master go so easily.”

“The strength of a mythical emperor is unquestionable. She might be able to inflict heavy injuries on him, but killing him is impossible,” the Divine Phoenix Holy Master smiled. “Even if the Empress comes herself, there’s nothing she can do about it. Furthermore, she has to consider the consequences. She can protect herself if an emperor goes crazy, but what about the other Divine Dragon’s lineage?”

The Divine Phoenix Holy Master’s words made Lin Yun feel relieved. At the very least, he didn’t have to worry about his master’s safety.

The Divine Phoenix Holy Master approached, and he whispered, “You should worry about yourself instead. You kidnapped their princess, who has become a myth. It won’t be easy for you to resolve this matter. If she wants to bring Lady Su away, even your master can’t do anything about it, as that’s a family affair.”

Lin Yun frowned because what the Divine Phoenix Holy Master said was reasonable. What should he do if the Empress wants to take Su Ziyao away? If the Empress weren’t eradicated, the trouble wouldn’t end.

Conversely, the Golden Dragon King was shocked to see the Radiant Sword Saint becoming the Radiant Sword Emperor. Wasn’t Yu Qingfeng invincible? So, how did he manage to make it through the tribulation?

“He succeeded!”

“The Radiant became an emperor!” The Emperors of the three holy lands were stumped with deep shock in their eyes, feeling a chill down their spines. This meant that no one could stop the Sword Sect’s rise.

The Golden Dragon King said, “Fellow Emperors, let’s act according to plan.”

There were three Emperors from the three holy lands, the Golden Dragon King, Silver Dragon King, and four Emperor Realm elders.

The Golden Dragon King turned to nod at the Silver Dragon King with a grave expression. He said, “We’ll have to trouble the Silver Dragon King now.”

The Silver Dragon King nodded and soared to the sky with five Emperors, heading towards the Sword Sect. This made the White Emperor’s face change, and he asked, “What are you all trying to do?”

“Naturally to congratulate the Radiant Sword Emperor,” the Golden Dragon King smiled.

The White Emperor said coldly, “I’m afraid you all are going to seize the Sword Sect’s dragon vein!”

After Tian Xuanzi died, the Empress’ plan failed and couldn’t stand out to stop the Radiant Sword Saint in his tribulation. Thus, they could only settle for the second best plan: seize the Sword Sect’s dragon vein.

It would naturally be good if the Radiant Sword Saint died because no one could stop her plan. But if the Radiant Sword Saint’s tribulation succeeded, she could only try to seize the Ancient Barren Dragon Vein at all costs.

The Golden Dragon King smiled, “White Emperor, let’s just watch a good show.”

“What if I’m unwilling?” The White Emperor said coldly.

The Golden Dragon King stood beneath the Golden-Purple Dragon Banner, saying, “I can only apologize then.”

The Dragon Kings were only second to the mythical emperors, and the Golden Dragon King was the strongest among all the Dragon Kings. Even so, he naturally wasn’t a match for the White Emperor. But he only had to use the banner to trap the White Emperor and didn’t need to for long.

“I might have restrained myself when the Silver Dragon King was here. Do you think that you can stop me by yourself? You’re courting death!” The White Emperor roared and unleashed a terrifying aura that wasn’t any inferior compared to Radiant in his tribulation.

But before his aura could spread out, the golden stage was like an invisible barrier that blocked it all out. The banner also didn’t budge as though the Empress was personally here.

The White Emperor frowned and pushed his palm forward, and the Golden Dragon King took a deep breath and faced it head-on. When the two palms collided, the golden stage began to tremble but wasn’t damaged.

The Golden Dragon King didn’t dare to be careless and felt tremendous pressure instead. He said, “Lord White Emperor, don’t even bother trying. With the banner here, you won’t be able to leave anytime soon. You only need to stay with me for an hour, and you’re free to leave.”

The banner could only increase the Golden Dragon King’s strength temporarily. It could restrain the White Emperor’s aura and suppress his phenomenon as a myth. Even so, it didn’t feel great for the Golden Dragon King to take a palm from the White Emperor head-on.

“Block my attack for an hour, then!” The White Emperor roared. He was furious and wanted to teach the Golden Dragon King a lesson even if he couldn’t leave this place.

As the two fought, the Golden Dragon King used the banner to face the White Emperor while the remaining two Emperor Realm elders maintained the spiritual array on the stage.

Simultaneously, the Silver Dragon King arrived at the Sword Sect with five Emperors. They didn’t even release their aura; their appearance was enough to make everyone on the Scarlet Firmament Peak nervous.

“The Silver Dragon King is here representing the Profound Imperial Palace, Ming Cult, Heavenly Flame Sect, and Myriad Lightning Sect here to congratulate the Radiant Sword Emperor!” A voice echoed in the Sword Sect, accompanied by a dragon's roar and a phoenix's cry.

A dragon and divine phoenix swiftly descended on the Scarlet Firmament Peak, landing before Lin Yun and the Great Saints. They were the Divine Phoenix Mountain’s Emperor and the old Azure Dragon from the Azure Dragon’s lineage. They were both top-tiered Emperor Realm experts.

The Radiant Sword Emperor was repairing the Sword Sect’s saint vein, and he couldn’t help sighing and stop after seeing this.

“Greetings, Master!”

“Greetings, Martial Uncle!” Lin Yun, Mu Xuankong, and everyone quickly bowed.

The Radiant Sword Emperor swept his gaze across everyone before nodding at Lin Yun. He knew that now wasn’t the time to talk.

“Radiant, congratulations. The Empress has been paying attention to your tribulation, and we’re here to congratulate you. We now have another pillar in Kunlun Realm!” The Silver Dragon King chuckled as though he didn’t know about Tian Xuanzi. The three holy lands’ Emperors also cupped their fists together behind him.

Jian Jingtian roared, “Don’t bother pretending. Who doesn’t know that Tian Xuanzi is her chess piece? The Sword Sect was nearly destroyed because of it, and the Empress still has the cheek to congratulate my master. How shameless can she be?!”

The Azure Python Great Saint mocked, “Where’s the Empress’ gift then? Don’t tell me she told you all to come here empty-handed?”

The Silver Dragon King didn’t bother with them and looked at the Radiant with a smile,” The Empress plans to confer you the title of the Ancient Barren Sword Emperor and have you become the lord of Eastern Desolation, ruling all the holy lands here. I wonder if this gift is up to your satisfaction?”

“Not interested. I have become an Emperor, and I can call off all the grudges in the past. But if anyone dares to bully my disciple of the Sword Sect, my sword won’t spare anyone, not even if it’s the Empress!”

The Radiant Sword Emperor had to be tactful with it in the past, but he didn’t have to be polite any longer now that he had reached the Emperor Realm. But all of a sudden, his face changed as he looked in the Divine Firmament Peak’s direction. He turned back to the Silver Dragon King, and he roared, “How dare you go after the Ancient Barren Dragon Vein!”
