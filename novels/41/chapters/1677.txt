Chapter 1678 – Cultivating Soul Energy

Ma Qing, Fang Yan, and Zhang Ying panicked when the Heavenly Star Cauldron appeared. They didn’t even hesitate to turn and run.

As a dragon roar echoed from the cauldron, the True Dragon Saint Liquid within it was being swiftly depleted, and a massive fog swept out.

“Die!” A cold light flashed across An Liuyan’s pupils as she charged forth with the cauldron. With just one attack, she killed Fang Yan and Zhang Ying. As for Ma Qing, he only managed to hold his ground for a brief moment before he threw out a mouthful of blood and slammed against the wall.

But before he could do anything, An Liuyan’s next attack arrived. She quickly threw the Heavenly Star Cauldron over. Ma Qing was turned into minced meat when the cauldron slammed into him.

Seeing this, Lin Yun was shocked because he didn’t expect the Heavenly Star Cauldron to be so powerful. He had also seen a similar cauldron before back in the Heavenly Cauldron Pavilion, so he had a deep impression of it. After all, it contained fifty thousand kilograms of True Dragon Saint Liquid, which had even made Lil’ Purple’s eyes turn red.

After An Liuyan killed Ma Qing, she landed on the lake’s surface with her clothes dripping wet, further outlining her outstanding figure. A mist rose from her body when she walked over, and her clothes swiftly dried off.

When she arrived at the pavilion, her footstep staggered, and Mo Ling’er swiftly stepped forth to help her. Waving her hand, a silver light flew over. It was the Silver Moon Mask that An Liuyan had previously seized.

“It looks like there was a misunderstanding between us, previously.” An Liuyan looked at Lin Yun with a smile before she bowed, “I would like to apologize for my actions.”

“So, can our transaction still go on?” Lin Yun asked, putting the Silver Moon Mask back on.

“If not for you being here today, I’d be doomed. So the transaction can naturally go on, even if it can’t. But I have a small question, what is your name, and where did you get the Blood Dragon Ginseng from?” An Liuyan’s eyes were staring straight at Lin Yun’s pupils.

“Lin Xiao. Xiao, as in the flute. The Blood Dragon Ginseng was given to me by a family senior.” Lin Yun replied.

Hearing that, An Liuyan didn’t show any disappointment as she continued, “Give me three days. You can come back three days from now, and I’ll try and gather the Heavenly Snow Lotus for you.”

“This is a deposit.” Lin Yun placed the Blood Dragon Ginseng on the table. “I hope Boss An won’t disappoint me in three days.”

“Young Master Lin, please hold on. I wonder if you’re comfortable with disclosing your background? After all, I’m impressed by how you heavily injured Ma Qing by moving your fingers.” An Liuyan took a step forth.

But Lin Yun didn’t stop and continued walking, his voice sounding out, “It’s nothing. I just have external help, and it’s not as impressive as you think.”

After Lin Yun left, An Liuyan’s pupils shone brightly, and she smiled, “He’s Lin Yun. He must be Lin Yun!”

“Missy, are you alright? He’s Lin Xiao. Based on the current situation, Lin Yun wouldn’t dare to show himself in the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea, even if he has a hundred more guts. Even if Lin Yun isn’t dead, you can only treat him as a dead person.” Mo Ling’er said.

But An Liuyan didn’t bother about what Mo Ling’er said and continued, “My intuition is telling me that he’s Lin Yun right from the start, but I dispelled that thought after his temperament changed when I removed his mask. But based on the grace he attacked with earlier, he must be Lin Yun! I won’t make a mistake, and Lin Yun is also proficient in music dao.”

“But how can Lin Yun’s attainment in music dao possibly be so high?” Mo Ling’er refuted.

“Don’t care about that for now. Take out all the Heavenly Snow Lotus this branch has and contact the other chambers of commerce to see if we can buy them.” An Liuyan instructed.

“This branch should only have two to three petals, and the other chambers of commerce won’t sell us much, even if they’re willing. We’re on the Skyflowing Island. But… Missy, are you really going to stay here for another three days?” Mo Ling’er asked in a concerned tone.

“I have already made up my mind.” An Liuyan said firmly. “Next time, I’ll meet him alone.”

“What should we do about the Blood Moon Sect, then?” Mo Ling’er asked.

“Join up with the elders first and calculate our losses. They failed this time and will definitely retreat from Skyflowing Island. After all, we’re not the only enemies of the Blood Moon Sect, and they’ll be courting death if they dare to be so rampant.”

Lin Yun left the city after leaving the Heavenly Star Pavilion. He casually found a reef in the sea and started cultivating. There were still three days until his next meeting with An Liuyan, so he could use this time to increase his strength. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

He had briefly tested his strength when he faced Ma Qing with the Thunderstorm Zither earlier. If he was at his peak, it wouldn’t be a problem for him to defeat Ma Qing, even without using the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella. After all, Ma Qing was slightly older, and there was no way he could be compared to a peerless genius like Qin Tian.

“My identity as a musician is the best way to disguise myself, and it’s hard for anyone to imagine that I’m actually a swordsman. Since that’s the case, I might as well try to increase my soul energy cultivation. That way, the power of my music dao will also increase.” Lin Yun sat on the reef and started practicing the Blue Dragon Skybreaking Art first before cultivating his soul energy with the Phoenix Heart Song.

Soul energy was also called mental energy, which was more challenging to cultivate than martial cultivation. After all, only a few cultivation techniques could be tempered the mental energy. People must construct spiritual runes, observe paintings, or consume saint fruits to increase their mental energy.

Mental energy was also harder to grasp than dragon origin, and it was a norm that one’s mental energy wouldn’t improve in one or two years only to receive sudden enlightenment. After playing the Phoenix Heart Song several times, Lin Yun’s heart gradually calmed down as he basked in the moonlight.

He took out the Divine Blood Fruit from his interspatial bracelet. This item was something that even Saints would fight over. But he couldn’t refine it now, nor could he sell it away. Then again, he could barely try and refine the eight leaves.

If he wanted to increase his mental energy, he could only rely on external help, aside from an inheritance. The saint leaves of the Divine Blood Fruit naturally had such an effect since it was born out of a deity’s blood. If one could refine the Divine Blood Fruit, it could even extend a Saint’s lifespan.

But it was a pity that he couldn’t use the leaves to treat his injuries. Since he couldn’t circulate his dragon origin, refining it wouldn’t increase his cultivation.

Swallowing a leaf, Lin Yun thoroughly chewed it before circulating the Blue Dragon Skybreaking Art to refine it. As the Blue Dragon Bone came to life, the dragon runes formed a vortex of thunderstorms in his violet palace.

As the vortex swiftly absorbed the boundless energy in the leaf, those energies turned into a golden stream that coursed throughout his body before they gathered at the profound palace in his mind. As the Golden Crow Saint Rune and Silver Phoenix Saint Rune shone brightly, they devoured the golden energy, and Lin Yun could sense his soul energy increasing at a visible speed.

But he was surprised to discover that the leaves could also strengthen his physique, and his Blue Dragon Skybreaking Art silently reached the second stage. When he reached the second stage, his bones underwent a transformation and looked like jade while emitting a blue glow. Even outside, he could faintly see his skeleton through his skin and flesh.

His bones seemed to have come to life as they devoured the golden energy from the leaves, and Lin Yun could sense that his Azure Dragon Saint Physique had been strengthened bu at least two-fold. The dragon runes in the Blue Dragon Bone also increased and reached seventy thousand. It wouldn’t be a dream for his dragon runes to reach a hundred thousand in the future.

Two days later, Lin Yun’s soul energy smoothly reached the pinnacle of third-grade Saint Spiritualist. When he opened his eyes, two saint runes appeared in his palm. They were the Golden Crow and Silver Phoenix Saint Runes, and they seemed alive as they shone brightly.

In the past, the saint runes weren’t this powerful. But now, it felt like they were a Golden Crow and Silver Phoenix that were about to come to life. If he could make another breakthrough in his soul energy and become a fourth-grade Saint Spiritualist, his mental energy cultivation would be comparable to a seventh-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm cultivator.

After all, it was public knowledge that in the same cultivation, mental energy could suppress multiple enemies in the same cultivation.
