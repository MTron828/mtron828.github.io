Chapter 2481 - I Have Three Flowers

When the Empress released her aura in the Quasi-Deity Realm, everyone felt fear and was deeply shocked.

The faces of the three mythical emperors became pale, with fear reflected in their eyes. They didn't expect her to be so powerful even if they knew they wouldn’t be her opponent before they fought. Compared to the Black and White Emperors, the Radiant Sword Emperor could still put up a fight.

Looking at the Empress, the Radiant Sword Emperor muttered, “How strong is Yu Qingfeng who fought her evenly?”

Now that he looked at it again, Yu Qingfeng held back and was stronger than he had imagined. There was no victor between them, and they only sought dao with their swords, which they managed to open that gate.

“Let’s leave this place first,” the Black Emperor said. He already lost his status as a mythical emperor, not to mention that they were heavily injured.

The Radiant Sword Emperor recollected his thoughts and left with the two emperors, landing beside Lin Yun.

Recollecting his gaze from the Empress, Lin Yun asked, “Master, are you guys alright?”

The Black Emperor squeezed out a smile, “I’m fine. She didn’t attack to kill us.”

The White Emperor complained, “That’s for you. She didn’t hold back against me, and my Golden Emperor Physique nearly crumbled.

Lin Yun turned to look at his master, and his master nodded. But it was evident that they couldn’t recover from their injuries anytime soon. Even so, Lin Yun heaved in relief before he wanted to enter the stage.

“Lin Yun, she held back against us but won’t hold back against you. Be careful,” the Black Emperor called out to him.

Lin Yun was briefly stunned before he understood what the Black Emperor meant. But he didn’t stop and took a deep breath before entering the stage.

“This brat is bold!” The Blade and Flame Emperors stood together, looking at Lin Yun entering the stage with a hint of respect on their faces.

“Oh?” The Flame Emperor looked at the Blade Emperor in shock.

With respect, the Blade Emperor said, “If I’m in his position, I won’t dare to go on the stage after witnessing Yan Chen’s strength.”

After defeating the three mythical emperors, The Empress warned Lin Yun by releasing her Quasi-Deity Realm aura. This was a warning that she would bring out her strength in the Quasi-Deity Realm if he decided to fight her. Even if she held back, there may still be accidents, and she wouldn’t have a hint of benevolence when she fights.

The Flame Emperor said, “It’s not easy to see you change your attitude.”

Even the Blade Emperor felt that way, but he didn’t say anything and looked at Lin Yun with a hint of respect.

The Empress descended from the stage and said, “The Black Emperor is right. I held back when fighting them but won’t hold back against you. If you can’t even defeat me, how will you deal with the Demonspirit Clan in the God Burial Mountain Range?”

Lin Yun bowed, “No matter what, I’m grateful you held back in the fight earlier.”

When they looked at each other, they were both surprised. Lin Yun wasn’t as arrogant as the Empress imagined, and the Empress wasn’t as ruthless as rumored. Then again, the White Emperor naturally wouldn’t feel that way.

Lin Yun continued, “There’s no need to hold back against me, and I won’t hold back either.”

What Lin Yun said was the truth because when the empress released her aura in the Quasi-Deity Realm, Lin Yun felt a great shock like other emperors. This was because he was stronger than other emperors and could see more than others. He could sense how powerful the Quasi-Deity Realm was. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Flower Burial Lin Yun is here to challenge the Empress!” Lin Yun cupped his fists together, formally issuing his challenge.

“Permitted!” The Empress said and appeared before Lin Yun, clenching her fist that turned into a golden-indigo radiance, forming into a dragon. The incoming punch felt like a pure-blooded dragon, lifting everyone’s hearts. The Empress’ Imperial Dragon Fist was a whole level stronger than before.

Lin Yun also didn’t hesitate to execute the Sovereign Dragon Fist. As the Heavenly Dragon Bone bloomed, the dragon’s blood within his body began to ignite.

The two punches bloomed on the stage as two bright suns collided. As a cloud of dust rose on the stage, the region they stood caved in from the impact they released. Time and space fluctuated as their figures became blurred.

“He blocked it!” Everyone exclaimed that Lin Yun didn’t step back from this confrontation. But if someone with a higher realm saw this, they would notice an Azure Dragon behind Lin Yun, and the entire Azure Dragon Constellation had descended.

It was like a majestic wall that blocked the Empress’ aura in the Quasi-Deity Realm, blocking the Imperial Dragon Fist. With an impact, the two continued to clash, causing the stage to tremble with various phenomena blooming.

In the next second, phenomena enveloped ten thousand miles of radius. That was the phenomenon belonging to Lin Yun and the Empress as myths, supporting half the sky of the Ancient Saint Domain.

Scenes of the Empress suppressing the darkness three thousand years ago appeared in the phenomenon, but Lin Yun’s phenomenon was his experience in the Heavenly Path. Anyone could see the difference between the two; one was dignified, while the other was arrogant.

“This is a clash between myths!”

“Through this battle, a myth would fall.”

“Their phenomena envelop the entire region!” Regardless of their cultivation, even emperors seemed significant under the phenomena.

The two took a hundred steps back. They might seem evenly matched, but if someone looked at it, fine cracks appeared on the Azure Dragon behind Lin Yun.

The Empress said, “I have been looking for the Heavenly Dragon Bone for three thousand years, and I didn’t expect it to fall in your hands. If you die, I will dig out the Heavenly Dragon Bone.”

Lin Yun smiled, “That will depend if you can do that. Ever since I arrived in Kunlun Realm, there have been countless people who wanted my life, but they were all killed by me in the end.”

“I’m just getting started!” The Empress replied. As she descended in front of Lin Yun, she roared, “Imperial Dragon Fist—Soaring Dragon Fist!”

The Empress executed the move that forced the Radiant Sword Emperor to retreat, and the phenomenon she released became even more terrifying. When Lin Yun took the punch head-on, he retreated to a few thousand feet away.

“The Eternal Sovereign Constellation isn’t invincible,” the Empress said. As she continued to attack with the Imperial Dragon Fist, she was like a comet that flew toward Lin Yun, attacking.

As a powerful aura swept out from the Empress, the entire fortune of the Divine Dragon Empire was gathered on her. When she threw a punch, the Azure Dragon behind Lin Yun shattered as the Azure Dragon Constellation beyond the thirty-six layers of heaven became dim. He couldn't summon it again anytime soon if Lin Yun had the Heavenly Dragon’s authority.

“They say the Heavenly Dragon Divine Physique is fearless in the Emperor Realm. Let me shatter it in the Quasi-Deity realm!” The Empress charged over, and she roared, “Myriad Dragons!”

As ten thousand dragons roared, they attacked Lin Yun, empowered by the Quasi-Deity Realm’s aura that pierced through space with each strike. This made the faces of all cultivators change, wondering if the Heavenly Dragon Divine Physique was about to be suppressed. In the past, the six dragon kings couldn’t get an advantage in the fight against the Heavenly Dragon Divine Physique, but the Empress shattered the Sovereign Constellation head-on.

“Imperial Dragon Fist doesn’t seem so impressive after all.” A burst of laughter sounded from the stage when everyone felt nervous. Forming his hands together, an Ancient Heavenly Dragon coiled around Lin Yun, blocking the incoming attack.

“Sovereign Dragon Seal!” Seven-colored radiance bloomed on Lin Yun’s hands. With a push, all the incoming dragons flew away like meteors, exploding mid-air.

This made the Empress frown because she didn’t expect the Heavenly Dragon Divine Physique to be so powerful even after she shattered the Sovereign Constellation.

“Heavenly Dragon!” Lin Yun roared before the Empress could think more about it as he vanished before appearing before her. The Heavenly Dragon Bone bloomed as Lin Yun returned to when the Heavenly Dragon still existed. When he raised his head, the Heavenly Dragon also raised its head, looking at each other.

“The Azure Dragon is powerful, but the Heavenly Dragon is the strongest!” Throwing out a punch, an Ancient Heavenly Dragon’s claw flew out, clashing with the Imperial Dragon Fist head-on. The claw shattered the phenomenon created by the Imperial Dragon Fist, and even the Empress’ aura dropped.

This surprised the Empress, and she slid to a few hundred meters away on the ground before stabilizing herself. But she wasn’t shocked as she executed her trump card with a cold flash in her eyes.

“Yin-Yang as heaven, Five Elements as earth!” As two Eternal Daos bloomed behind her, the two daos intertwined and combined, unleashing a terrifying aura that no one could imagine. When the Empress clenched her fist, she grasped the phenomenon created by the two Eternal Daos before she threw a punch out.

“I am the sovereign!” It was this move again that defeated the three mythical emperors. When everyone was wondering how Lin Yun would face it, he spread his arms apart, his hair fluttering from the wind.

“Everything is nothing before Nirvana!” Lin Yun only released an Eternal Dao. But when he spread her arms, the Nirvana Dao bloomed, and the incoming punch was quickly resolved, unable to fuse back together.

“Yin-Yang as heaven!” Lin Yun roared as another Eternal Dao bloomed. He also knew Yin-Yang Dao.

“I have a sword for the empress to experience!” Lin Yun used his finger to unleash a sword ray, radiating the past and future, unleashing a fast and slow sword. This sword ray pierced through the Empress’ shoulder, creating a bloody hole.

The Empress took ten steps back before stabilizing herself, and her face finally changed.

Sensing a familiar aura on the Empress and looking at her wounds recovering swiftly, Lin Yun muttered, “The Divine Dragon Physique.”

He was fortunate to possess the Heavenly Dragon Divine Physique, or he might be unable to suppress the Empress.

The Empress said, “It has been so many years, and you’re the second person I’ve seen to grasp two Eternal Daos aside from the Southern Emperor. Even someone as powerful as Yu Qingfeng didn’t grasp two Eternal Daos. You can resolve my Eternal Daos with two combined, but it’s a pity that you didn’t grasp them for long and can’t withstand the Heavenly Dao Fist!”

The Empress turned into the manifestation of Heavenly Dao and charged at Lin Yun. “Even if it’s nirvana, this fist of mine can shatter it!”

The Empress didn’t have a hint of emotion in her eyes as time sped up and space shrank. A crimson mountain and river tribulation appeared, enveloping the Ancient Saint Domain. All the cultivators, including the emperors, were enveloped in a layer of crimson radiance.

Lin Yun only reached out to block the punch with his palm. At the same time, another flower appeared behind Lin Yun, his Saint Dao, which had reached the level of an Eternal Dao. The three Eternal Daos bloomed behind him as Lin Yun’s sword intent broke through the ninth-grade.

This made the Empress squint and was shocked for the first time.

Lin Yun said, “Your punch might be able to shatter nirvana, but it’s a pity that I’m a Sword Immortal and have three flowers.”

When Lin Yun pushed his hand forward, cracking sounds came from the Empress’ arm, and she sent flying out.

“Holy shit...what’s going on...” the Ice and Abyssal Emperors were dumbfounded as they cursed.

The Flame Emperor’s face changed, and the Blade Emperor exclaimed, “How is this possible?!”
