Chapter 2148: Chaotic Battle (2)

When the sun appeared, it looked like the world’s creation as the darkness retracted. Lin Yun looked at the rising dawn, and exclaimed, “So beautiful.”

People should be like the rising sun, passionate and young.

.

Xin Yan and Bai Shuying also opened their eyes as the sunlight shone on their faces. This made their already flawless faces look even more bewitching.

Their skin was white and flawless, emitting a faint radiance that made them look ethereal like fairies.

“They’re really beautiful.” Lin Yun smiled after taking a look at his left and right. He now knew why everyone wanted to give him a beating. To have such beauties beside him, even he had the intention of giving himself a beating.

“Ye Qingtian, Dao Yang, Ji Zixi, the three of you can come at me!” He Xuanjing opened his eyes on the throne with a domineering aura spreading out, instantly breaking the peaceful atmosphere.

Lin Yun wasn’t afraid of He Xuanjing. But just when he wanted to step forth to fight him, Ji Zixi stole the lead. She stood up and looked at He Xuanjing, “Dao Yang, you don’t mind if I fight him first, do you? Otherwise, this person will think that no one in the Eastern Desolation can stand up to him.”

“You can go first.” The Dao Yang Holy Son knew Ji Zixi for many years, and he naturally knew her temper.

“No need to be in such a rush to fight first. All of you will have a chance. After all, you guys will lose anyway.” He Xuanjing looked stern and arrogant. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“What arrogance. Don’t think that you’re invincible just because you’re the champion of a Heavenly Path!” Ji Zixi soared to the sky and released dazzling flames from her body.

In the next moment, a pair of golden flaming wings unfolded behind her. The wings reached ten feet long, filled with an ancient and sacred aura. As the sacred flames blazed on her wings, this made her look like a phoenix who underwent rebirth through the flames.

“That’s the Sacred Phoenix Wings!”

“The Little Princess of the Divine Phoenix Mountain has finally made a move!”

“It looks like there’ll be an interesting battle to watch now. Ji Zixi isn’t weak. It would be a huge joke if the champion of a Heavenly Path thinks that there’s no one in the Eastern Desolation.” Outside the Dragon Mountains, the cultivators from the Eastern Desolation became excited with an uproar from the surroundings.

On the Blue Dragon Path, Situ Yan and Gu Xiyan exchanged a gaze and smiled at the same time. The holy sons beneath them stood together with rapport, unleashing powerful fighting spirits as multiple waves of Quasi-Saint auras fell onto them.

The two didn’t take them seriously, but could feel their blood boiling. In fact, they had a heated gaze as they felt their blood boiling from the fighting spirits released by the holy sons. This made them feel as though they had gone back in time, back to when they were fighting on the Heavenly Paths.

“Haha. I never thought that I would join forces with you one day,” Situ Yan grinned.

“Let’s fight, then,” Gu Xiyan said as he dashed forth.

“Remember! The one who defeated you guys is the champion of the Third Heavenly Path, Situ Yan!” Situ Yan was much bolder than Gu Xiyan, who dashed forth as he laughed.

They had to deal with these people first before fighting amongst themselves for the Dragon’s Head of the Blue Dragon Path.

On the White Dragon Path, Baili Xun, the Champion of the Sixth Heavenly Path sneered while dashing from his throne.

On the Golden Dragon Path, Feng Chenyi, the Champion of the Eighth Heavenly Path waved his hand and fought everyone on the Dragon’s Head.

With that, the nine dragon mountains fell into chaos as the sunlight tore through the darkness. Multiple battles were taking place at once with multiple horrifying phenomena appearing. Many people summoned their constellations as they fought. This was unprecedented within the Kunlun Realm.

Outside the Dragon Mountains, many people exclaimed as they watched the battles. They could feel their scalps going numb, and their breathing became hurried. If it wasn’t for this battle, they wouldn’t have known that there were so many geniuses within the Kunlun Realm.

On the Indigo Dragon Path, An Liuyan was feeling uneasy as she sat on the Dragon’s Head. She saw many people charging in her direction. This was because everyone was unhappy with her identity as the demonic path’s demoness, wanting to chase her out.

But Bai Lixuan and Drifting Goblet calmly stood by her side. Drifting Goblet raised the wine jar in his hand, and smiled, “Lady An, relax and just sit on the throne. Since the Ninth Princess wants you to be on the Dragon’s Head, no one will be able to touch you!”

They were like guards as they stood before the throne, fighting everyone who came towards the Dragon’s Head. They both had calm expressions as they unleashed a terrifying power with a wave of their hands.

The battles on the other Divine Dragon Paths were chaotic, but it was much calmer on the True Dragon Path. The experts of the True Dragon Path surrounded the throne from various directions, protecting Ye Ziling within.

Mu Qianjue merely looked at them with a smile, but these people were loyal to their words.

Since Lin Yun had won their respect, they willingly gave the spot to Ye Ziling. They weren’t strong, and many of them weren’t from the holy lands. Many of them had a mixture of origins, but they were extremely loyal.

“No one is allowed to compete with Lady Ye. If anyone dares to come, I’ll fight them to the death!”

“Don’t bother having any thoughts about the Dragon’s Head. If anyone wants to try and steal the fruit, don’t blame us for being ruthless!”

“Lady Ye, you don’t have to be afraid. We’re all good people. Don’t leave, this spot belongs to you.” When the cultivators furiously looked around, they had really frightened Ye Ziling.

Ye Ziling could only smile bitterly, while finding these people to be adorable. At the very least, they were much better than hypocrites.

“Don’t worry about it. No one will touch you since it’s already decided for you to be the Champion of the True Dragon Path,” Cao Yang smiled.

The Ye Clan’s members outside the dragon mountains were furious because Ye Ziling was simply too lucky.

Even Ye Ziling was dumbfounded because she didn’t expect her journey on the True Dragon Path to have such an outcome, and all of this was attributed to one person.

As Ye Ziling’s thoughts drifted, she couldn’t help turning to look at the Azure Dragon Path. Coincidentally, Lin Yun was also looking over in her direction.

Lin Yun might be on the Azure Dragon Path, but his heart was on An Liuyan and Ye Ziling, fearing that they would be implicated in the chaos. But everything was fine after seeing how it looked at the moment. When Lin Yun noticed Ye Ziling’s gaze, he nodded with a smile at her.
