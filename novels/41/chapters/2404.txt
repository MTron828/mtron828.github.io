Jiang Yi said arrogantly after devouring all the phenomenon. The surrounding area fell into silence with shock when they looked at Yan Xiu, who was lying on the ground.

“He has cultivated the Myriad Phase Divine Eye,” Xia Qingyun said. “He reached such a high mastery in this divine art.”

Feng Bumao and everyone else looked at Jiang Yi, who had golden flames blazing on his forehead. The seal was striking, which looked like a heavenly eye that made him look dignified, as though he could see through anything.

If one looked at it carefully, they would see that the golden seal looked like it had multiple worlds, and there was a human in each world, forming a seal and creating various phenomena. But all the phenomena was gathered in the golden seal on his forehead, the Myriad Phase Divine Eye.

Even if the deities of the Shadow Divine Palace couldn’t obtain the Myriad Phase Divine Eye, the Great Phaseless Divine Art was equivalent to a forbidden technique in the Shadow Divine Palace. In the chaotic times, the Shadow Divine Palace emerged by relying on someone who practiced this forbidden technique. The seal on his forehead shone brightly as if that was Jiang Yi’s trump card.

“The Shadow Divine Palace is truly formidable.”

“These three forces are really ridiculous to send out three peerless geniuses for one Lin Yun.”

“Haven’t you noticed that Lin Yun was only an excuse? They’re trying to suppress the Heaven’s Gate before the Heaven’s Gate produces their divine son.” Many people came to their senses and noticed that Lin Yun was just an excuse for them to make a move, and they didn’t bother acting now.

“So, Lin Yun has become invisible...”

“I’m afraid the three of them didn’t place Lin Yun in their eyes.”

“Heaven’s Gate is in a difficult position now, and it’s meaningless even if they used their trump cards.” The faces of the ancestral deity’s disciples became ugly.

“How weak!” Jiang Yi smiled as he arrogantly looked around.

Is the Heavenly Barren Banquet going to turn into a joke? Many disciples of Heaven’s Gate were furious.

Feng Bumao was also clenching his fists together. He knew that these people came prepared, but he didn’t expect that just Jiang Yi alone was so terrifying.

“Since the three of you are targeting me, why direct it at Heaven’s Gate? I’m here, and I’m up for a fight if you want.” Lin Yun spoke out, raising his brow, and looking at Jiang Yi. These people were too much, and Lin Yun couldn’t bear it any longer.

“You?” Jiang Yi sneered, “Is there really no one in Heaven’s Gate?”

“No need.” Feng Bumao went on the stage, and he looked at Lin Yun, “There’s no need for you to make a move. Our Heaven’s Gate won’t allow someone to take you away from the Heavenly Saint Courtyard.”

His voice was indifferent and cold. Although the three merely used Lin Yun as an excuse, it was unavoidable for Feng Bumao to be unhappy because this was all caused by Lin Yun.

Lin Yun was briefly stunned before he bitterly smiled. He didn’t expect that his goodwill to help wasn’t appreciated. He helplessly smiled, “It seems I have become the sinner.”

“Big Brother Lin isn’t a sinner. There’s no need to pay any attention to them,” Yue Weiwei said.

Lin Yun merely smiled and said nothing.

Jiang Yi looked at Lin Yun, and smiled, “No hurry. I’ll deal with you after Feng Bumao. Just one of us can easily deal with someone like you.”

Jiang Yi charged at Feng Bumao when he was done speaking, which Feng Bumao didn’t dodge and faced Jiang Yi head-on with a snort. When their palms clashed, Feng Bumao’s constellation opened, revealing a Sovereign Constellation, the Divine Solar Lunar Cauldron. This caught Jiang Yi by surprise and was forced to take a few steps back with his face changing.

“As expected of the Heavenly Saint Courtyard’s holy son,” Jiang Yi smiled.

Feng Bumao couldn’t smile, and his face became grave from the aching pain coming from his hand. He charged forth and didn’t hold back his Sovereign Constellation with which the Divine Solar Lunar Cauldron appeared in the air. He unleashed thirty-six palms in the blink of an eye, and each palm was terrifying. The cauldron shone brightly, as though the sun and moon had descended, pushing his aura to a higher stage.

But his attacks were still lacking when compared to Jiang Yi. When Jiang Yi became serious, the Myriad Phase Divine Eye flashed, unleashing light beams to resolve the thirty-six palms. This made Feng Bumao throw out a mouthful of blood before he clasped his hands together and the cauldron descended from the sky.

Jiang Yi spread his arms apart and a terrifying power swept out from the cauldron. Just the shockwave alone was enough to reach him.

Seeing this, Feng Bumao turned around and pushed his palm forth. The cauldron soared to the sky and flew towards Jiang Yi.

Facing the Divine Solar Lunar Cauldron, Jiang Yi didn’t dare to be careless and dodged again.

Feng Bumao controlled the cauldron, which would leave a hole in space whenever it flew out. This made everyone in Heaven’s Gate excited, but they soon became worried because Feng Bumao’s aura began to fall after each attack. After ten-odd moves, his complexion became terrifyingly pale.

“It has come to an end now!” Jiang Yi slammed his palm at the incoming cauldron, producing a vast uproar and sending it back at Feng Bumao.

Feng Bumao was sent flying away before he could even respond, throwing a mouthful of blood with his bones breaking. If he didn’t have a high cultivation, he would have been reduced to minced meat from the impact. Even so, he still suffered heavy injuries.

But it was fortunate that he flew in Lin Yun’s direction. Lin Yun easily caught him, resolving the impact.

“Shadow Divine Son, let me face you!” Right then, Ji Zhangkong made a move, wanting to catch Jiang Yi by surprise. He was confident that Jiang Yi was injured from the earlier impact, and he wanted to take this opportunity to defeat him. If he succeeded, he would become famous since Jiang Yi was a divine son.

This might not seem righteous, but his sword was fast and didn’t give anyone the time to react. By the time Jiang Yi sensed the sword, the sword was already an inch away from his face. But the Myriad Phase Divine Eye shone brightly as he circulated the Great Phaseless Divine Art.

The sword began to tremble, unable to take another inch forth, to which Jiang Yi retaliated. This sent Ji Zhangkong flying away with his face changing, throwing out a mouthful of blood.

Ji Zhangkong retreated, and his retreat was even faster than his attacks, since he had already considered his path of retreat.

Before Jiang Yi could unleash another attack, Ji Zhangkong left the stage. Everyone had to admit that Ji Zhangkong’s speed at running away was breathtaking.

Jiang Yi sneered, “Are swordsmen as shameless as you? Not only did you launch a sneak attack, but you didn’t even dare to receive my palm.”

This scene and Jiang Yi’s words made everyone’s faces ugly while Ji Zhangkong pretended that he didn’t hear it.

Feng Bumao’s face also changed, but he soon realized that his injuries were being healed rapidly. It was because Lin Yun was injecting his blue dragon aura into Feng Bumao's body to stop his injuries from worsening. When he came to his senses, he realized that he was recovering due to Lin Yun, whom he held a grudge against earlier. He said with guilt on his face,” Thanks.”

“This is nothing,” Lin Yun calmly replied, not taking what happened earlier to heart.

Jiang Yi naturally noticed Lin Yun and Feng Bumao and a chill began to rise in his eyes. Since he couldn’t vent his anger on Ji Zhangkong, he could only lock onto Lin Yun.

“Since there’s no one amongst the ancestral deity’s disciples capable of fighting, don’t stop me from capturing Lin Yun. Flower Burial, kneel and beg for mercy!” Jiang Yi circulated the Great Phaseless Divine Art with the Myriad Phase Divine Eye shone brightly on his forehead with his voice echoing. With a flash, he swiftly approached Lin Yun, and this made everyone’s faces change.

After all, Jiang Yi had proven his strength. Even Feng Bumao wasn’t his opponent. So when Jiang Yi turned to Lin Yun, no one doubted that he could easily take Lin Yun down. If the champion of the Heavenly Barren Banquet was taken away, Heaven’s Gate would be utterly humiliated.

Seeing this, the ancestral deity’s disciples became anxious, and Feng Bumao said, “Leave. I’ll help you hold him back!”

He was sincere with his words, and he knew how strong Jiang Yi was.

“Hahaha! Why do I have to fear?” Lin Yun laughed as he reached out and threw Feng Bumao behind him. This scene shocked everyone because they never expected that Lin Yun had no intentions of dodging.

When a huge explosion resounded, the entire stage began to tremble. The brutal scene that they imagined didn’t occur. Instead, a sword ray shot into the sky.
