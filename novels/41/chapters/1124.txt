Chapter 1125 - Recite My Name! (2)

“Die!” Yan Teng roared as he tried to tear Leng Aoran apart. But all of a sudden, a bizarre scene unfolded. Sparks flew off of Leng Aoran’s chest after the collision. Somehow, he blocked Yan Teng’s attack!

Everyone looked at Leng Aoran with disbelief. They realized that he was wearing a layer of metallic armor. The armor looked heavy and emitted a terrifying aura like a naturally formed battle cloth.

“The Profound Sky Heavy Armor!” Yan Teng exclaimed. “You’re a disciple of the Ancient Barren Domain’s Profound Sky Sect!”

“The power of a saint artifact is really strong. It’s a shame that you can’t even bring out a tenth of its power. You might as well give it to me!” Leng Aoran laughed as blood dripped from his pale face. Before Yan Teng could respond, Leng Aoran had reached out and grabbed onto the spear.

Lei Lan and Xuan Fei were both surprised when they heard about the Profound Sky Sect. This was a secret technique of the Profound Sky Sect that only disciples of the Profound Sky Sect could learn, and the Profound Sky Sect was the strongest sect in the Ancient Barren Domain!

Thinking about it, Lei Lan and Xuan Fei were both surprised. They couldn’t figure out what a disciple of the Profound Sky Sect was doing in the Profound Azure Manor. But regardless of their thoughts, Yan Teng who had just unleashed his attack had exhausted a great deal of his astral energy.

In a split second, Leng Aoran stole Yan Teng’s saint artifact.

“Hahaha! It’s been three years! I’ve finally found something interesting in this god damned place! A saint artifact, hahaha!” Leng Aoran held onto the spear as his facial expression became distorted with excitement.

Looking at Leng Aoran, Yan Teng regretted what he just did. He finally understood that Leng Aoran purposely got injured. Seeing this scene, the core disciples of the other sects fled without any hesitation.

“Since all of you are here, you might as well stay behind! Hahaha!” Leng Aoran laughed and held onto the silver spear with both his hands and swung it around, fully unleashing his baleful aura.

The baleful aura that he swung manifested into a terrifying and powerful gale that was accompanied by a ferocious dragon roar. As a dragon soared into the sky with a crimson gale, the escaping disciples were swept back to Leng Aoran.

Once again, everyone was within range of his baleful aura. Their faces were pale and they couldn’t move because fear was plastered on their faces.

“Now, the game has finally begun. So who should I start with?” Leng Aoran held onto the spear and glared at Patriarch Qiu.

Sensing the gaze, Patriarch Qiu was terrified to the point that he fell to the ground and began to panic. Even the other empyreans of the Qiu Clan fell to their knees in panic.

“Lord Sword Demon, please spare our lives! We’re all innocent!”

Listening to many people begging him to spare their lives, a burst of laughter came from Leng Aoran.

At this moment, Patriarch Qiu crawled forward and kneeled before saying, “Lord Sword Demon, I’ll take full responsibility for the matter today. I’ll prepare the 8,000 Divine Astral Pellets that you want within half a month. If you want to kill someone, kill me and let the rest of the Qiu Clan go.”

“No! No! No! No!” Leng Aoran grinned, “Please don’t misunderstand. You’ve contributed the most out of anyone here. After all, how could I obtain a saint artifact without you? You don’t have to worry about anything. I’ll save you for last!”

As he laughed, Leng Aoran turned to Yan Teng’s group. Xuan Fei and Lei Lan panicked as they turned to look at their leader Yan Teng.

Calming himself down forcibly, Yan Teng’s eyes flickered and said, “Lord Sword Demon, since you’re a noble disciple of the Profound Sky Sect, you must have an important task to be in the Profound Azure Manor. If you’re willing, I’m willing to serve you!”

Hearing those words, Leng Aoran was surprised before he smiled, “You’re not strong, but you’re not stupid. You barely have the qualification to be my dog!”

“Thank you, my lord!” Yan Teng’s eyes flashed with joy as he fell to his knees. He had already sorted everything out in his mind. He knew that he would only face death if he returned to the sect without the saint artifact. But if he followed Leng Aoran, he wouldn’t have to die.

“Not bad!” Leng Aoran’s eyes flashed with satisfaction before he pointed at the core disciples of the other sects. With a smile, he said, “Then help me kill them.”

Yan Teng’s face instantly changed when he heard that because these people were all core disciples from various sects. If he killed them, he wouldn’t have any hope of recovering. After all, he would be making enemies with the entire Profound Azure Manor. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Furthermore, his reputation would also be ruined because he practically bowed for survival and became the servant of a demonic cultivator. But Yan Teng made his decision and got back on his feet, “Indeed, there’s no need for my lord to dirty his hands with these people.”

Yan Teng was a decisive person after he made up his mind. But when the core disciples of the other sects saw Yan Teng walking towards them, they had disbelief in their eyes. Didn’t Yan Teng say that he would kill Thunderclap Sword Demon? In the blink of an eye, Yan Teng had become Leng Aoran’s servant. “Yan Teng, are you insane?!”

“Yan Teng, you’re a genius of the King Suspend Palace. Don’t you have any backbone?” A genius barked.

“I won’t bother talking to a group of dead people,” replied Yan Teng.

Looking at this scene, Leng Aoran smiled because Yan Teng was qualified to be his servant, not to mention that his harvest today was simply unimaginable. So Leng Aoran was in a good mood right now.

Just when Yan Teng was about to kill everyone here, flute music began to sound out under the moonlight. As the flute music gradually got closer, the sword intent contained in the music began to start boiling while a silver figure gradually approached from the darkness. Hearing the flute music, everyone could feel their blood boiling violently.

“Flower Burial is here!” Someone shouted upon hearing the flute music. After all, the title Flower Burial had been making waves in the Profound Azure Manor recently. All the demonic cultivators who were targeted by him were killed without exception.

Flower Burial? Yan Teng was instantly dumbfounded because he had no idea why Flower Burial showed up. After all, it was too much of a coincidence that Flower Burial showed up just when he made up his mind to kill the core disciples of the other sects.

He had already thrown his face away, and he would no longer have any face to stay in the Profound Azure Manor anymore in the future. Realizing this fact, Yan Teng’s face was ugly as he clenched his fist tightly.

When Patriarch Qiu saw the silver figure approaching, he had a joy on his face and gradually got back on his feet, “We’re saved!”

When the flute music came to a stop, Lin Yun lowered the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute. Since he wore a silver mask, no one could see his expression. However, they could tell that he was looking at Leng Aoran with indifference.

“One more came to die?” Leng Aoran looked at the silver figure and grinned while holding onto the silver spear with both hands.
