Chapter 1454 - Nether Palm

While Huangfu Yan and Lin Yun were having a standoff in front of the Great Profound Palace, a figure streaked across the Scarlet Firmament Peak’s Saint Pool Square and landed before the gorgeous palace that was closest to the Saint Pool.

At the top of the palace was a beauty who was cultivating. Her eyes flashed with unhappiness when she sensed the person who came over. She was Mu Xueqin, and only Mu Qingqing dared to intrude during her cultivation. Furrowing her brows, she said, “Qingqing, this is the second time you’ve disturbed me.” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

She had been in seclusion for the past month trying to reach the seventh stage in the Scarlet Firmament Sword Sutra, but she wasn’t very successful.

“Give me a good reason, or I’ll teach you a lesson this time. Don’t you know any manners?” Mu Xueqin sternly said.

“Big Sister, I really have something important. Didn’t you ask me to pay attention to Lin Yun?” Mu Qingqing smiled.

“I didn’t say that. I asked you to try and pull him over to the Scarlet Firmament Peak. When did I tell you to pay attention to him?” Mu Xueqin powerlessly said.

“Oh, sorry about that, then. I’ll take my leave.” Mu Qingqing said with a dejected expression.

When Mu Xueqin looked at Mu Qingqing, she felt a headache and could feel her blood boiling. “Speak what you want before you leave!”

Mu Qingqing immediately smiled when she heard that and replied, “Big Sister, it looks like you’re pretty concerned about him. It’s different from what you’ve said previously.”

But Mu Xueqin didn’t say a word and sent a cold looked at Mu Qingqing. This made Mu Qingqing stick her tongue out before he smiled. “Alright, alright. Big Sister, you’re really spot on this time. When Lin Yun became a heaven direct disciple, he became a target for everyone. Lin Yun and Huangfu Yan are about to fight in front of the Great Profound Palace!”

“Huangfu Yan? That Prince Yan?” Mu Xueqin briefly pondered before she continued, “I’m not surprised. It’s only a matter of time.”

“You don’t seem to be worried about him.” Mu Qingqing was surprised when she saw how calm Mu Xueqin was.

“It’s bound to happen with him standing in the limelight. It’s nothing if he’s beaten up. He can beat up Huangfu Yan in the future,” replied Mu Xueqin. It was impossible to avoid fighting in the Sword Sect.

But no matter how arrogant Huangfu Yan was, he wouldn’t do anything extreme. Fights weren’t prohibited in the sect, but there were three taboos: you’re not allowed to harm another disciple’s life, you’re not allowed to cripple another disciple, and you’re not allowed to launch a sneak attack on another disciple.

Aside from that, there were many other rules. If you weren’t happy, you could just fight with the other party.

“Big Sister, you’re really naive. They’re serious this time. If Lin Yun loses, he’ll forgo his identity as a heaven direct disciple, and everyone is in an uproar near the Great Profound Palace. Even the various peaks are alarmed!” Mu Qingqing solemnly replied.

Mu Xueqin’s face finally changed when she heard that because that was a little too serious. She couldn’t help exclaiming, “Is he insane? Where did he get his confidence from!”

“What if he has the Nine-Petaled Netherflower of the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra, bringing his Divine Firmament Sword Sutra to the pinnacle of the second stage?” Mu Qingqing replied.

“That’s impossible!” Mu Xueqin stood up, finally unable to maintain her composure any longer.

“Big Sister, you scared me!” Mu Qingqing was startled by Mu Xueqin’s abrupt action.

But Mu Xueqin ignored her and started walking around. Her Scarlet Firmament Sword Sutra had been struck at the sixth stage for a long time, so she couldn’t maintain her composure when thinking of the possibility that Lin Yun might have reached the pinnacle of the second stage in the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra.

She soared into the sky without hesitation, heading to the Great Profound Palace. Since she couldn’t figure it out, she would just have to see for herself and see if it was true.

On the plaza in front of the Great Profound Palace, there was no one in the surroundings aside from Lin Yun and Huangfu Yan. Everyone’s gazes in the surroundings fell onto Lin Yun with disbelief; they couldn’t believe that he actually agreed to it. If Lin Yun loses the fight, he would have to give up his status as a heaven direct disciple.

“I’m impressed by your courage. But with all due respect, you might have unlimited potential, but you’re not worthy of being a heaven direct disciple right now! At least, you’re still far behind when compared to me!” Huangfu Yan was arrogant in his tone. He was surprised that Lin Yun agreed to it, but that was all. In his view, Lin Yun wasn’t worthy of being a heaven direct disciple, at least not for now.

“Why don’t you come and prove it, then?” Lin Yun looked at Huangfu Yan with a playful smile. His gaze was filled with provocation as his hair fluttered in the wind. He knew that Huangfu Yan wasn’t the only one with this thought in the Sword Sect. Since that was the case, he would shut everyone’s mouths today.

“Don’t regret it, then!” Huangfu Yan’s gaze was cold as rage blazed in his pupils. He was unhappy with Lin Yun’s gaze, he had no idea how to keep a low profile. He had just joined the Sword Sect but was already arrogant. This was why Huangfu Yan wanted to give Lin Yun a beating.

Huangfu Yan charged forth with a terrifying sword ray emitting from him, possessing the ethereal temperament of a cloud and the grandiose of the ocean. The two contradictory sword auras were perfectly fused, combined with his three-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm aura; this brought his sword aura to a terrifying height.

But Lin Yun merely sneered and fearlessly charged forth, executing the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra. When they collided on the plaza in front of the Great Profound Palace, they launched their ferocious attacks against each other.

Sword vibrations echoed, and Huangfu Yan finally gauged Lin Yun’s strength after ten-odd moves. Lin Yun was talented, had a strong sword intent, and the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra was strong, but he only reached the pinnacle of the second stage with it. Meanwhile, he had long reached the pinnacle of the third stage of the Azure Firmament Sword Sutra.

Most importantly, his cultivation was nothing worth mentioning in Huangfu Yan’s eyes. Since that was the case, he would show Lin Yun the power of a three-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm. He no longer held back and circulated his entire cultivation.

As sword rays shone from him, his aura began to ferociously rise, and his aura completely suppressed Lin Yun in the blink of an eye. With a sneer, Huangfu Yan’s sword aura converged in his palm and formed into a vortex that manifested with clouds. Before he unleashed his attack, the vortex had already left cracks in the surroundings with black bolts of lightning flashing around.

“This is the end, Lin Yun!” Huangfu Yan unleashed his attack, easily smashing Lin Yun’s sword aura apart.

This made everyone’s faces change. Then again, they weren’t surprised because Lin Yun was only at the one-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm, and they didn’t think he could compete with Huangfu Yan, who was at the three-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm. It was within their expectations that Huangfu Yan would gain the upper hand in the battle the moment he unleashed all his cultivation.

But even when Huangfu Yan’s attack was descending towards him, Lin Yun had no panic on his face and looked up with a smile. His devilish smile and purple mark on his forehead made him look even more striking.

When he looked up, he pushed his palms out and faced Huangfu Yan’s palm head-on. Simultaneously, his ocean of astral energy began to tremble and a massive Netherflower appeared in the sky before it began to slowly revolve.

As the Netherflower revolved, Lin Yun’s clothes and hair began to flutter and the surrounding sword aura regathered and started soaring into the sky. The Netherflower was gorgeous, but it was also lonely. When the Nine-Petaled Netherflower bloomed and made a full circulation, Lin Yun’s hair fluttered in the wind and he smiled, pushing his palms forth against Huangfu Yan’s palm.

With a devilish smile, the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron slowly rose from the ocean under the control of the Netherflower in his violet palace. The moment it appeared out of the ocean, the entire ocean began to rumble with raging waves.

Letting out a roar, Lin Yun’s palms collided with Huangfu Yan’s palm, causing the surrounding space to incessantly tremble. The head-on clash made Huangfu Yan throw a mouthful of blood before he fell towards the ground like a broken kite.

As a cloud of dust rose, cracks started to spread out on the ground when Huangfu Yan descended. This instantly made the audience dumbfounded as they raised their heads to look at Lin Yun, who was hovering in the air, shining brightly.

“Divine Firmament Peak’s Lin Yun seeks enlightenment from Senior Brother!” Lin Yun’s roar echoed throughout the plaza before the Great Profound Palace.

With the absolute annihilation of the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra, he wielded the Dragon-Phoenix with his Nether Palm.
