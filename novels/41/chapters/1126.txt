Chapter 1127 - Extraordinary Swordsman! (2)

Blood was also leaking from Lin Yun’s mouth. Although Leng Aoran wasn’t able to pierce through his heart thanks to the mask, Silver Moon, he was still injured. However, his injuries weren’t as serious as Leng Aoran’s injuries.

“Lin Yun, are you alright?” Lil’ Purple asked nervously from inside the sword box.

“Don’t worry about me. Go and chase after him, he won’t be able to escape,” said Lin Yun.

“But someone is coming!”

“Don’t worry about it. I know who it is, so just chase after him,” explained Lin Yun.

“Okay,” replied Lil’ Purple.

Then, Lin Yun sat down on a rock. It didn’t take long for Yan Teng, Xuan Fei, and Lei Lan to appear. They were rushing over with malice on their faces.

Yan Teng was particularly happy when he saw the blood on Lin Yun’s lips. He knew that Lin Yun would be injured from Leng Aoran’s attack.

“Flower Burial, you didn’t expect this, right?” Yan Teng smiled with joy in his eyes because Lin Yun wasn’t strong enough to kill Leng Aoran. However, there was still the matter of the stolen saint artifact.

If he returned to King Suspend Palace empty-handed, he would be killed. However, it would be a different story if he returned with Flower Burial’s head. There might be a small chance that his senior brother would spare him.

“He’s been hunting demonic cultivators over the past month, so he must have a lot of treasures!” Xuan Fei’s eyes flickered with greed as he licked his lips.

“Haha! His mask might also be a saint artifact!” Lei Lan said with his eyes blazing.

When Yan Teng heard that, flames began to blaze in his eyes. If he could return with the mask, he might not be punished at all. Without any hesitation, Yan Teng, Xuan Fei, and Lei Lan issued a similar order, “Kill him!”

The three of them were heavily injured, but they didn’t dare to bet on the fact that Lin Yun could no longer retaliate. They didn’t want to take any risks, so they pointed at the disciples to do their work.

The disciples of the three sects looked at Lin Yun with killing intent. However, they remembered Lin Yun’s earlier performance, so they had traces of fear in their eyes.

“Are you guys sure you guys want to listen to him?” Lin Yun asked, glancing at everyone.

“Kill him! We’ll split his wealth!” Yan Teng said, gritting his teeth.

Upon hearing that, the other disciples no longer hesitated.

Looking at the disciples charging at him, Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly. He placed the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute by his lips and played the Overlord Sword. The song felt like a violent storm that came and went. In just a brief moment, the flute music had already torn the sky apart with bolts of lightning.

Before the disciples of the three sects could even get close to Lin Yun, they were beheaded by the music. Just like that, blood splashed around like the surroundings were being painted red.

Yan Teng, Xuan Fei, and Lei Lan turned white as their legs trembled. Is this Flower Burial’s strength? Is this the strength that forced Thunderclap Sword Demon to flee for his life?

Now that they looked at it again, Thunderclap Sword Demon’s strength surpassed their wildest imagination. However, Flower Burial was even more terrifying than the Thunderclap Demon Sword!

Lin Yun suddenly stood up on the rock and coldly gazed at Yan Teng’s group. Under his flute music, blood started to drip from their mouths as music lingered in their ears.

“You really think that I can’t put up a fight anymore? I bet you didn’t know that I’ve been waiting for you!” Lin Yun said coldly.

“Who the hell are you?!” Yan Teng spoke with fear in his voice.

“Who am I? Have you already forgotten about me so quickly?” Lin Yun smiled before he took off the silver mask, revealing his true appearance to Yan Teng, Xuan Fei, and Lei Lan.

The jaws of Yan Teng, Xuan Fei, and Lei Lan dropped. They couldn’t believe that Flower Burial was Lin Yun who was only in the Heavenly Soul Realm. How is this possible?!

Placing the flute on his waist, Lin Yun appeared before the three of them and locked his gaze onto Yan Teng, sending chills down the latter’s spine. Yan Teng wanted to kneel and beg for mercy, but his legs wouldn’t listen to him no matter how much he trembled.

“Since your dog legs can’t even stand, there’s no need for you to have them.” Lin Yun grabbed the Flower Burial Sword and swung it. Yan Teng’s knees were instantly shattered as he fell to the ground.

“Lin Yun, you’re courting death!” Yan Teng roared while looking at Lin Yun. “You bastard! If you dare to kill me, you’ll bring a tragic consequence to the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect!”

“Since your dog eyes like to look down on people so much, you might as well not have them.” Swinging his sword once more, Lin Yun destroyed Yan Teng’s eyes. Immediately, blood poured out of Yan Teng’s eye sockets.

“My eyes!” Yan Teng panicked and covered his face with both hands.

“Since you like to bully others so much with your dog paws, it’s best that you don’t have them!” Lin Yun swung his sword once more, instantly slicing off Yan Teng’s arms.

“No! No! No!” Yan Teng roared in despair as he was filled with regret. He never expected that the Heavenly Soul Realm ant he had humiliated two days ago would take revenge against him in such a bloody manner.

“You injured my pet and humiliated me. So let me help you remove your head from your body!” When Lin Yun swung his sword one last time, Yan Teng was decapitated.

The scene greatly terrified Xuan Fei and Lei Lan. Just who the hell did they offend? Without any hesitation, the two of them fell to their knees and begged, “L-Lin Yun! Y-Y-Yan Teng was the mastermind. It had nothing to do with us!” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“I’m a fair person. Since the two of you gave me a palm back then, I’ll give you one sword.” Ignoring the two of them, Lin Yun swung his sword out once more before sheathing it.

Blood splashed from both their necks, causing Xuan Fei and Lei Lan to hold their necks. But no matter how tightly they held their necks, they couldn’t stop the blood from flowing.

Now that Lin Yun was done with what he wanted to, he put on the silver mask once more. Immediately, his hair turned silver as he flew through the sky.

By the time the core disciples came back, Lin Yun was enveloped in the moonlight while he played his flute.

It was a song filled with sorrow because he couldn’t find a partner to play with. At the same time, it was a blood-boiling song that expressed his extraordinary sword!
