Chapter 1801 - How Fragrant

“It’s impossible for Tian Xuanzi to keep such a low profile based on his personality. He must be planning something.” Lin Yun said.

“The sect master said there’s a possibility that Tian Xuanzi was injured.” Zhao Yan said.

“There’s also that possibility, but don’t be careless.” Lin Yun looked concerned because Tian Xuanzi was a tough opponent. The moment Tian Xuanzi was determined to get something done, he would get it done no matter what.

His appearance was deceptive. After all, who could imagine such a gentle-looking person was plotting the annihilation of Sword Sect’s golden generation eighteen years ago? But someone like him was also cruel to his own people.

After all, he could stop Jian Jingtian from causing a massacre in the Profound Sky Sect if he wanted to eighteen years ago. But he watched and waited for this matter to blow up before forcing the Radiant Sword Saint to take a step back and imprison Jian Jingtian in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect.

If Lin Yun didn’t have the Firmament Saint Cloth, his master would have lost his life and the entire Sword Sect would’ve been doomed outside the Ancient Barren Battlefield.

“Senior Brother, I’m more concerned about you rather than the Sword Sect. We’re all concerned about you and waiting for Flower Burial to return to the Sword Sect.” Zhao Yan said.

“There will be such a day, and the Sword Sect will return to being a holy land, sooner or later. It will be done in our generation.” Lin Yun smiled.

“I believe it.” Zhao Yan nodded. The two then chatted for a long time. But Lin Yun couldn’t stay long, so he bade his farewell before daybreak.

“Senior Brother, you must come back alive. We’re all waiting for you. You’re the hope of our generation, and we will welcome you with a grand ceremony at that time.” Zhao Yan said, looking at Lin Yun’s silhouette.

As the first gleam of dawn overlapped with Lin Yun’s silhouette, he briefly paused before leaving the Sword Sect’s residence, making his way back to the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion.

The Liu Saint Clan within the Vermilion Bird District was welcoming a distinguished guest whom the Wind Edge Lord had to welcome himself. As the Wind Edge Lord listened to what the guest said, he sent a curious look at the person.

This person was Zhuge Qingyun, the most outstanding disciple under Tian Xuanzi. Before Jian Jingtian made his breakthrough, Zhuge Qingyun was said to be invincible beneath the Saint Realm. This meant he had reached a high level of cultivation, maybe at the pinnacle Nirvana Stage or Quasi-Saint Realm.

After listening to what Zhuge Qingyun said, the Wind Edge Lord was calm and even had a hint of mockery on his face. This made Zhuge Qingyun ask, “The Wind Edge Lord doesn’t believe it?”

“If you’re saying Lin Xiao is Flower Burial, I believe it because there’s a possibility. But it’s impossible for the Heavenly Origin Mirror and Dragon Pulse Ranking to make a mistake at the same time. The odds are close to none.” The Wind Edge Lord smiled.

“Even if just having the Azure Dragon Saint Physique doesn’t mean anything, he still grasped the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent. There can’t be such a coincidence in the world. There is at least a 30% percent or even 50% percent possibility that he’s Lin Yun.” Zhuge Qingyun said with his brows locked together.

The Wind Edge Lord was a shrewd person. Despite his hatred for Lin Xiao, he didn’t show it on his face and replied, “Since that’s the case, why isn’t Tian Xuanzi doing anything? Profound Sky Saint Sovereign, invincible in the Ancient Barren. I have even heard of his name within Heavenly Domain City.”

His tone was filled with mockery because many people in Heavenly Domain City looked down on the Ancient Barren Domain. It was true that Tian Xuanzi was a genius, and he was the only one who had a high chance of becoming an Emperor in the past millennium, not to mention he was still young. But after boasting about being invincible in the Ancient Barren for so long, this naturally made everyone think he was bragging, not to mention that the Radiant Sword Saint was still alive.

Zhuge Qingyun wasn’t furious with the Wind Edge Lord’s tone, but said, “He has a special identity. There’s a possibility that he’s a genius of the Azure Dragon’s lineage or a disciple of the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain.”

Those two identities were troublesome, and they couldn’t afford to offend either of them. Even Tian Xuanzi would have to weigh his options well. It was naturally good if they killed the right person. But if they killed the wrong person, the consequences would be dire.

The Wind Edge Lord simply smiled because he already guessed Zhuge Qingyun would say that.

“If my master makes a move, there will be no chance of turning back. But if I make a move, there is room for maneuvering, even if I make a mistake.” Zhuge Qingyun said softly.

“Carry on dreaming. If he’s really Lin Yun, don’t forget that he has the Firmament Saint Cloth that can even kill a Great Saint.” The Wind Edge Lord said.

Zhuge Qingyun smiled when he heard that, “I do hope that he can still use it. There will be a price to pay for using such a treasure, and he’ll die once it’s over!”

The Wind Edge Lord kept his silence, so Zhuge Qingyun continued, “The Wind Edge Lord doesn’t believe me? Actually, I don’t believe it, either. But as long as there’s a 30% possibility, I can’t let it go. The Liu Saint Clan and Tian Xuanzi are loyal to the Empress, so we can cooperate in this matter.”

“I don’t think there’s even 30%. There’s no way he can be Flower Burial. You’re telling me he can become first on the Dragon Pulse Ranking in a year? I don’t believe it!” The Wind Edge Lord indifferently said.

Zhuge Qingyun merely glanced at the Wind Edge Lord and quietly shook his head. It was great if he could receive the help of the Liu Saint Clan to deal with Lin Yun. But it didn’t mean there was no way even if the Liu Saint Clan refused to help.

“I’ll be taking my leave, then.” Zhuge Qingyun stood up and was about to bid his farewell.

But just when he was about to step out of the door, the Wind Edge Lord raised a cup and said, “Brother Zhuge, don’t be in such a hurry to leave. Let me finish.”

“Oh?” Zhuge Qingyun was surprised, and he asked, “You believe he’s Lin Yun now?”

As the Wind Edge Lord wore a sinister smile, he replied, “I don’t. But it doesn’t matter to me at all. What has his identity got to do with me wanting him dead?”

Zhuge Qingyun was taken aback before he figured it all out. He was dwelling over whether Lin Xiao was Lin Yun, but the other party didn’t have to consider that. The Wind Edge Lord simply wanted Lin Xiao’s life and it was that simple.

Seeing this, Zhuge Qingyun smiled and came back.

“It’s easy to kill him, but that woman within the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion has the Imperial Dragon Order. If not for that, I would’ve killed him a long time ago on Thunder Island!” The Wind Edge Lord said, gritting his teeth.

“But the Imperial Dragon Order is useless if he’s Lin Yun. Even if he’s not, my master is willing to bear the consequences.” Zhuge Qingyun said.

The Wind Edge Lord grinned because he was waiting for Zhuge Qingyun to say that.

After returning to the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion, Lin Yun briefly met with Yue Weiwei before he began stabilizing his cultivation. Aside from that, he had to practice the Azure Dragon Sword Art and Divine Firefly Sword—Firefly Radiance.

The Divine Firefly Sword was profound. The Firefly Radiance might seem to be a sword, but there were over nine hundred changes in it. The greatest weakness of the Firefly Radiance was the difficulty in executing it, and it was hard to execute it in a short time.

Every second counts in a fight between two experts, and your opponent wouldn’t give you much time to prepare for your attack. But as Lin Yun became more proficient in it, this sword was becoming increasingly terrifying, and the power was also undergo a drastic transformation. Just by relying on this sword alone, he could easily slay enemies who had a higher cultivation than him.

While Lin Yun went into seclusion within the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion, Heavenly Domain City broke into an uproar as those within the top ten subsequently made it to the Samsara Edict Realm. The Divine Phoenix Mountain’s Ji Lingfeng, Ming Cult’s Yu Wenxiu, Heavenly Flame Sect’s Yan Chihuo, Divine Dao Pavilion’s Lin Qingyang, the Autumn Mountain Lord, and even the Wind Edge Lord made a breakthrough to the Samsara Edict Realm.

In fact, they could’ve made a breakthrough into the Samsara Edict Realm a long time ago, and they were even strong enough to fight some experts at the Profound Life Stage. The reason why they held back was that they were coveting the first place on the Dragon Pulse Ranking. This was the reason why they had been accumulating.

But Lin Xiao’s appearance crushed their hopes and even made them feel despair. As long as Lin Xiao was around, no one would be able to obtain first on the Dragon Pulse Ranking. So they couldn’t wait any longer.

This was why they began to start making a breakthrough. There were rumors that Ji Lingfeng reached the third-stage Profound Life Stage in his breakthrough due to his accumulation. The Samsara Edict Realm was divided into the Profound Life, Profound Death, and Nirvana Stages.

Regardless of the Profound Life or Profound Death Stages, they each have seven minor stages. After experiencing seven profound life and seven profound death stages, they would reach the Nirvana Stage, grasping the nirvana aura.

Every breakthrough was a great boost in strength for them, and their dragon origin would undergo a transformation. The fact that Ji Lingfeng reached the third-stage Profound Life Stage in his breakthrough was enough to prove how much he accumulated within the Dragon Pulse Realm.

Ordinary people would need years to reach the third-stage Profound Life Stage because the Profound Life Stage was on a whole new level in comparison to the Dragon Pulse Realm. Putting it in a nutshell, they didn’t want to play with Lin Xiao any longer.

Since they would be suppressed by Lin Xiao if they stayed at the Dragon Pulse Realm, they might as well make a breakthrough to the Samsara Edict Realm so that they were one realm above him. So even if Lin Xiao’s dragon pulses were ten thousand feet long, he was still at the Dragon Pulse Realm.

Aside from these people reaching the Samsara Edict Realm, a phenomena kept appearing at the Black Tortoise Void Sea, strumming everyone’s heartstrings. But under this whole turbulence, Lin Yun was still stabilizing his cultivation.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Half a month later, an unexpected guest interrupted Lin Yun’s seclusion. It was Gu Jun of the Law Enforcement Hall. They could be considered acquaintances, and it was almost time for Lin Yun to end his seclusion. Thus, he wasn’t furious that he was interrupted, but asked with a smile, “What brought you here?”

“Are you looking down on me just because you became first on the Dragon Pulse Ranking? You didn’t even come to see me when you returned.” Gu Jun questioned.

“That’s because I’m in seclusion. You know that I have to stabilize my cultivation or my next tribulation might arrive at any moment.” Lin Yun smiled, taking out a jar of wine.

“Show off.” Gu Jun glanced at Lin Yun in disdain. But when he saw the wine Lin Yun took out, he immediately wore a smile on his face. “Dragon Clan’s wine! This is much better than the wine in the Heavenly Star Pavilion.”

This made Lin Yun furrow his brows because he instantly knew this old man went to the Heavenly Star Pavilion to eat and drink again. Covering the jar with his hand, Lin Yun said, “Speak if you have anything.”

Gu Jun was furious when he saw Lin Yun covering the jar just when he wanted to take a mouthful. He raised his head and smiled, “You think I want it? That lass told me not to go to the Black Tortoise Void Sea.”

“Oh?” Lin Yun asked in surprise. “Why?”

Raising his brow, Gu Jun smiled, “The Fire God General of the three god generals is there. Because of what happened to the Lightning and Wind God Generals, the Blood Moon Sect’s higher hierarchy is furious. The Black Tortoise Void Sea won’t end peacefully.”

Lin Yun’s face changed when he heard that, then he asked, “What is the origin of this Blood Moon Sect? Why are they becoming so arrogant in recent years?”

“You want to know?” Gu Jun smiled with his eyes squinted.

When Lin Yun nodded his head, Gu Jun nudged his lips to the jar, signaling for Lin Yun to move his hand away. This naturally made Lin Yun unhappy, but there was nothing he could do, and could only move his hand away.

“How fragrant!” Gu Jun clicked his tongue after taking a mouthful of the wine.
