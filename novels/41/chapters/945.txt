Chapter 946 - Brothers

Everyone from the Demonic Constellation Realm wore a solemn expression on their faces as if they were performing an ancient ceremony. This made Lin Yun’s face change because he had to admit that this scene had startled him. Raising his head to look at Lil’ Red who was swinging the Heavenly Demonic Dipper Staff around, his eyes flashed with surprise because it looked like this staff had a bigger origin than he had imagined.

He knew that Lil’ Red must be using the Ancient Dracoape Art to manipulate the Heavenly Demonic Dipper Staff which created this phenomenon. But the power was a little too terrifying even for him. Furthermore, Lil’ Red’s cultivation technique came from Yue Weiwei, and this meant that Yue Weiwei probably had a terrifying origin in Kunlun Realm.

Just when Lin Yun was in deep thoughts, the phenomenon in the sky disappeared as Lil’ Red descended down before looking at the staff and chuckled incessantly. There was a huge difference in their size and started laughing like an idiot who found a treasure.

When everyone from the Demonic Constellation Realm got back up, their expression became unnatural when they looked at Lil’ Red, especially Wu Mu. After all, he said that he could give it to Lil’ Red as long as Lil’ Red could pull it out. But now, not only was Lil’ Red capable of pulling it out, it could even unleash the full power of the demonic dipper metal.

But he was naturally unwilling to give it out. Not only was it a dao artifact, but it must also hold a huge meaning since everyone from the Demonic Constellation Realm kneeled and kowtowed to it.

“Brother Wu, it’s fine joking casually.” Lin Yun didn’t want to put Wu Mu in a tough spot and wanted Lil’ Red to return the staff.

But when Wu Mu heard that, he quickly started waving his hand, “No, no, no. Since I’ve said it, how can I possibly take back my words? Furthermore, the Heavenly Demonic Dipper Staff can truly shine in its hands, so there’s nothing bad about that.”

Hearing what he said, Lil’ Red who was unhappy instantly became excited and held onto the Heavenly Demonic Dipper Staff tightly.

Meanwhile, Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts before he said, “How about this. I won’t take advantage of you. Aside from one-third of the Gold-furred Demonic Ape’s blood essence, you can also have the other materials. Aside from that, you will be facing your fourth tribulation soon, right? I’ll give you another eight hundred divine astral pellets.”

What Lin Yun said left Wu Mu stunned before his mind blew and looked at Lin Yun with disbelief. Eight hundred divine astral pellets? Did he hear it correctly? Even the other Demonic Constellation Realm’s geniuses were shocked because eight hundred divine astral pellets was a little too exaggerated.

Lin Yun didn’t bother about their thoughts and patted his interspatial pouch to retrieve a chest box containing divine astral pellets. Each chest box was sealed with spiritual talismans. When Wu Mu opened them up, he was instantly dazzled by the sheer number of divine astral pellets.

Part of the reason why he sold his life to Mo Yan was that he needed one hundred divine astral pellets urgently. But he never expected that he could obtain eight hundred of them from Lin Yun which had completely exceeded his imagination.

Taking a deep breath to calm himself down, Wu Mu then turned to look at Lin Yun, “Brother Lin, your generosity has won me over. I’m ashamed to take so many divine astral pellets, but I need them urgently. Otherwise, I won’t be able to compete with those experts in the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm. So I won’t be polite to you. But you can look for me if you need any help in the future. Our Demonic Constellation Realm doesn’t have many merits aside from not fearing death.”

Wu Mu was really humble. But mentioning that they weren’t afraid of death, even Lin Yun had to give his respect to Wu Mu. After all, he didn’t hesitate to charge at the Gold-furred Demonic Ape when he was nearly torn into two. Someone like Wu Mu fitted Lin Yun’s temper well and the two chatted for a long time.

During this period, Lin Yun also found out why they would kowtow when they saw the Ancient Dracoape’s image. So it turns out that Wu Mu’s clan had the Dracoape’s bloodline with the Ancient Dracoape being their totem. So the Ancient Dracoape was sacred in their Demonic Constellation Realm.

After they were done chatting, they then started splitting up the Gold-furred Demonic Ape’s corpse. Lin Yun only took the beast core and let them have the other materials. Wu Mu found that the Gold-furred Demonic Ape had a rib engraved with spiritual runes on it. If it was tempered well, it could be turned into a weapon no weaker than a dao artifact. This meant that he wouldn’t have to fight with his bare hands in the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm.

After Wu Mu extracted the blood essence, he looked at Lil’ Red and said, “This Dragon-blooded Cat’s vitality is shocking, but it’s also dangerous for it to refine two-third of the blood essence. Our clan has a secret technique passed down by our ancestors. If you can trust me, I can help it refine the Gold-furred Demonic Ape’s blood essence.”

Upon hearing that, Lin Yun’s eyes lit up and nodded, “That’s even better.”

If Lil’ Red could refine the Gold-furred Demonic Ape’s bloodline, it could easily reach the second soul Heavenly Soul Realm. With the Heavenly Demonic Dipper Staff in its hands, its strength would probably grow to a terrifying height.

“First take out a hundred divine astral pellets.”

Listening to Wu Mu, Lin Yun patted on his interspatial pouch without any hesitation and took out a hundred divine astral pellets. If they were converted into astral pellets, they would be equivalent to a million astral pellets. As the astral energy began to spread out in the valley, Wu Mu didn’t dare to be careless and let Lil’ Red jump into the pile of divine astral pellets.

“Demonic dipper metal.” Wu Mu said and an elite from the Demonic Constellation Realm walked out with a metal enveloped in the crimson aura before putting it down.

“Oh, Ancient Dracoape. Please let the demonic constellation blaze for eternity!” As Wu Mu started forming ancient seals, strands of black flames flew out from him and instantly melted the divine astral pellets and demonic dipper metal. Then, the flames soon formed into an ancient spiritual array emitting an ancient and barbaric aura along with the changes of Lin Yun’s seals.

Lil’ Red who was seated in it started gritting its teeth but it didn’t scream out. But it only lasted for a brief moment before it started screaming out in pain. This scene made Lin Yun’s face change and wanted to stop Wu Mu. But he could see the stubbornness in Lil’ Red’s eyes as it clearly had no intentions of giving up.

This fool… Lin Yun’s eyes became watery when he saw this scene. He suddenly recalled how Lil’ Red risked its life to protect him back in the Skymound Mountain Range. Back then, it was also determined to protect him.Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Although Lil’ Red might seem lazy normally, its determination was not any weaker than Lin Yun. Everyone said that Lil’ Red was his pet. But in his eyes, he had treated this fool as a brother.

“Brother Lin, the blood essence.” Wu Mu said gritting his teeth with a grave expression with his forehead covered in sweat.

You have to hold on! Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with a decisive light and threw the blood essence into the ancient array. Under the temperament of the spiritual array, the blood essence came to life and started wiggling towards Lil’ Red. When the blood essence entered Lil’ Red’s body, it began to roar even louder with pain written all over its face. At the same time, the divine astral pellets in the array were being exhausted at a rapid speed.

“More divine astral pellets!” Wu Mu yelled.

With no hesitation, Lin Yun patted on his interspatial pouch and threw two hundred more divine astral pellets into the array.

“Not enough!” Not long later, Wu Mu’s face changed because Lil’ Red’s appetite had far exceeded his imagination. It seemed to have practised a cultivation technique and the thirst in its bloodline was unimaginable.

Lin Yun’s face changed and hesitated briefly before he threw three hundred more divine astral pellets into the spiritual array.

An hour later, the flames in the array finally started to die down and made the face of Demonic Constellation Realm’s geniuses change. They began to wonder just how terrifying was this Dragon-blooded Cat’s bloodline that needed so many divine astral pellets.

This was also the first time Wu Mu had run into this situation with his face turning pale. Anyone could tell that he was having a hard time holding on.

Even before Wu Mu could say a word, Lin Yun threw another four hundred divine astral pellets into the ancient spiritual array. This meant that there were a total of a thousand divine astral pellets used. When the boundless astral energy spread out, it made the ground in the valley start turning red as if they were blazing.

At the same time, Lil’ Red had also reached a bottleneck as its body began to swell with its fur all standing up. This scene made Lin Yun worry if anything would happen because he initially thought that there wouldn’t be any mishap with Wu Mu helping out. But even had he never expected that Lil’ Red would have such a great appetite to exhaust a thousand divine astral pellets.

Just when Lin Yun was feeling nervous, the black flames shot into the sky from the array before the entire array exploded. As an immense power swept out, Lin Yun was shocked because he was nearly sent flying by this force.

“It failed?” Lin Yun asked.

“No, it’s a success,” said Wu Mu. Stones rose up from the broken array with countless demonic dipper metals which started to merge in the flames and formed into an ancient dracoape statue that enveloped Lil’ Red in it.

Not long later, the dracoape statue grew to a terrifying height of thousands of meters. Only after watching this scene, did Wu Mu let out a breath of relief and smiled, “This fellow is simply a monster. There’s a record that a senior of my clan only manifested a statue of three hundred meters when he went through his tribulation.”

Even the other Demonic Constellation Realm’s geniuses were exclaiming at the size of Lil’ Red’s statue.

“It’ll break the seal in half a month to one month. At that time, it should be in the second soul Heavenly Soul Realm.” Wu Mu’s gaze was blazing and said, “I really want to see how strong it’ll become. Perhaps it’s fate that the sacred artifact of my clan is in its hands.”

Lin Yun also smiled because his nerves finally loosen up now. He knew that Wu Mu will be leaving soon with the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm’s opening approaching. Wu Mu will definitely make use of the time remaining to go into seclusion.

“Brother Lin, you don’t have to send me off. We’ll meet again two months from now in the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm. I believe that you’ll shock everyone with your strength at that time,” laughed Lin Yun. He only respected experts regardless of their origin.

“We’ll meet again at that time.” Lin Yun cupped his hands together in response.

After the Demonic Constellation Realm’s party left, Lin Yun turned to look at the massive statue with his eyes blazing. He knew that he also had to start refining the Gold-furred Demonic Ape’s beast core or he would be left behind by Lil’ Red.
