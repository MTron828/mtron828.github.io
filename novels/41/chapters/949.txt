Chapter 950 - Why Afraid Of A Fight?

Lin Yun coldly repeated the leader’s words. His voice wasn’t loud, but everyone could hear him clearly.

“It’s Lin Yun!”Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Azure clothes, a sword box, and a Dragon Blooded Cat. Who else could it be, but Lin Yun?”

“He actually appeared!” The higher realms clamored because they didn’t expect Lin Yun to enter the city so brazenly. After all, he only covered half of his face.

“He really just waltzed his way into the city.”

“I can’t believe he’s butting his way into the Skyhawk Realm’s affairs. Wang Chao isn’t a pushover!”

“Wang Chao is in the third soul Heavenly Soul Realm. Yuan Hengtian can’t compare to him.”

Everyone was looking at Lin Yun with greed in their eyes. They were hoping Lin Yun was in over his head and that they could steal his treasures.

“Brother Lin!” Liu Yun and Chen Xuan were shocked that Lin Yun showed up.

“Flower Burial Lin Yun?” Wang Chao’s eyes flashed with joy when he looked at Lin Yun. He immediately signaled the Skyhawk Realm to surround Lin Yun.

“Surround him!” Wang Chao chuckled as he looked at Lin Yun, “You’re really bold. Hand over the Glorysun Spirit and your sword. If you do, I won’t make things difficult for you.”

The rest of the Skyhawk Realm’s geniuses looked at Lin Yun with sinister smiles. They knew that Lin Yun had more valuables than the Highcloud Realm. Most importantly, many higher realms had suffered greatly in the hands of Lin Yun. If they took him down, they would be famous among the higher realms.

“Glorysun Spirit? I’m afraid you don’t have the capability of taking it,” said Lin Yun. His words made the Skyhawk Realm unhappy.

“You must be courting death!” Wang Chao said coldly, “I was a fool to waste my time trying to reason with you. I guess I need to teach you some manners!”

Five different second soul Heavenly Soul Realm elites soared into the sky and surrounded Lin Yun. Wang Chao knew that the five couldn’t do anything to Lin Yun, but with their help, he could find an opportunity to take Lin Yun down.

He had to do this in one strike, otherwise the other realms would make a move. He didn’t want the others to take the Glorysun Spirit, greater dao artifact, and advanced fortune martial techniques.

“Watch out!” The faces of Highcloud Realm’s geniuses changed. But just when they were about to help out, the situation suddenly changed. A sword hum leaked out of Lin Yun’s body and damaged the elites that charged at him.

“What impudence!” Lin Yun removed his mask and threw it at the elites. All five of them were sent flying, which made Wang Chao freeze.

“Die!” Unable to maintain his composure, Wang Chao gnashed his teeth with a cold light flashing through his eyes. His punch was terrifyingly fast as he had pushed his cultivation to the limit. But Lin Yun simply raised his eyebrows when he saw the attack.

As his sky sword intent circulated, a terrifying sword aura shot through the air and pierced through Wang Chao’s aura. Wang Chao felt like his soul was being restricted by the sword intent.

But Lin Yun’s sword aura only lasted for a split second. Before the spectators could figure out what was going on, Lin Yun threw a dazzling golden punch. Wang Chao’s origin energy was torn apart as his chest caved in. When he fell onto the ground, he was forced to kneel before Lin Yun’s boundless sword intent.

Everything happened in the blink of an eye. It was so fast the crowd was deathly silent.

All of the ferocious gazes became soft as no one dared to reveal their killing intent.

Wang Chaos’ face was nasty as he kneeled on the ground. Whenever he tried to get up, he found the weight of a colossal mountain crushing him. How is this possible? At this moment, he was overwhelmed with fear because he had no idea what Lin Yun would do to him.

Everyone else from Skyhawk Realm looked at Lin Yun with fear. They retreated as fast as they could, which shocked everyone from the Highcloud Realm. Mu Yan was especially shocked because he couldn’t even injure the Skyhawk Realm’s leader.

However, Chen Xuan and Liu Mu were even more shocked. Although Lin Yun was strong two months ago, they were still comparable to him. But now, they couldn’t even see the back of Lin Yun’s figure. Intimidating a third soul Heavenly Soul Realm expert with a single glance was unimaginable to them.

“A piece of trash like you wanted to teach me how to behave? Do you really think the higher realms are invincible? Get lost!” Lin Yun grabbed onto his mask and sent Wang Chao flying.

Wang Chao flew through the air and spit several mouthfuls of blood. As soon as he hit the ground, he rolled until he crashed into the Skyhawk Realm’s group. Out of fear, they quickly helped Wang Chao up and fled.

Hearing what Lin Yun said, many geniuses from the higher realms felt a chill run down their spine. Although Lin Yun was speaking to Wang Chao, his words were meant for all of the higher realms. Clearly, he was just as arrogant as before.

But there was nothing they could do about it other than swallow their pride. Meanwhile, the lower realms watched in awe. Lin Yun was just as arrogant as the rumors.

After Lin Yun dealt with the Skyhawk Realm, he walked towards the Highcloud Realm. After a simple greeting, Lin Yun began to enquire about his friends from the Profound Amber Realm. Mu Yan smiled and said, “Your friends are here. I had them dress up as Highcloud Realm’s disciples to travel with us. After all, the Bloodbone Realm have been looking for something they could threaten you with.”

Upon hearing that, Lin Yun felt a current of warmth flowing into his heart. He knew that Mu Yan took on a huge risk to do this, but this proved that saving Liu Yun was the right move.

“Big Brother Lin!” Liu Yun looked at Lin Yun with excitement. As a swordsman, he had been completely subdued by Lin Yun’s grace.

“Lin Yun!” Fang Shaoyu, Zhu Qingshan, and Zhao Chen also stepped forward. They were excited to see Lin Yun again.

“Lin Yun, are you heading towards the shrine?” Mu Yan suddenly asked. He could tell that Lin Yun was heading towards the shrine. If there wasn’t the matter with the Skyhawk Realm, Lin Yun would probably already be there.

“Yeah.” Lin Yun nodded.

“The higher realms gathered in the shrine are a lot stronger than the Skyhawk Realm. It’s not just the Bloodbone Realm that wants to deal with you,” said Mu Yan with a grave expression. He didn’t want to see Lin Yun take an unnecessary risk.

Since the higher realms could get close to the shrine, they clearly had a lot of strength. The leaders of their realms were at least in the top thirty on the Azure Dragon Ranking.

Thinking about that made everyone from the Highcloud Realm nervous. After all, the higher realms gathered together while Lin Yun was alone. Mu Yan looked at Lin Yun and said in a grave tone, “This is a dangerous trip and you might not be able to come back.”

“Then I won’t come back,” smiled Lin Yun before he put on his mask. “As a swordsman, why would I be afraid of a fight? The Bloodbone Realm came after me time and time again, so it’s time for me to resolve this matter.”

Then, Lin Yun headed towards the shrine without turning back.
