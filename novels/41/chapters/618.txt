Chapter 619 - Ancient Southern Domain, Fighting with the Sword!

Now that he got through the final trial, he was only one step away from the ninth level that held the empyrean’s legacy. An empyrean was rare in the Ancient Southern Domain and no one even knew if an empyrean was still in the Ancient Southern Domain.

He could only guess that there might be grand elders of overlord forces who were empyreans. There was nothing to say about an empyrean’s power, except that they were unbelievably powerful, especially the ancient ones. With this in mind, he was only one step away from such a legacy.

This was a big deal for Lin Yun. Taking a deep breath, he pushed open the doors to the massive gate. But in the next second, his entire world began to spiral and he could feel his body being stretched and his consciousness becoming blurred.

By the time he regained his vision, Lin Yun realized that he was on top of a cold lake with a starry sky above his head. Looking at the ninth level, Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts, “This is the tomb’s ninth level?”

This place was different from what he had imagined. He was standing on top of a boundless lake. Aside from the starry sky, it didn’t seem like there was anything special about this place. But when he raised his head, he saw a figure at the center of the lake.

Lin Yun pondered briefly before he walked over slowly. Looking at that person in the distance, Lin Yun slowly approached with caution. When he saw that person’s appearance, Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with surprise because it was the Bloody Butcher Ji Wuye.

“It’s you?” Ji Wuye raised his head to look at Lin Yun and the surprise in his eyes grew denser. But after a brief shock, he soon revealed an eerie smile.

Ji Wuye hadn’t forgotten what Lin Yun did to him before entering the empyrean’s tomb. Lin Yun had contradicted him publicly, which humiliated him greatly. Even the Yan Kong that he had just defeated had mocked him. So if Lin Yun didn’t die, then his infamous nickname as the Bloody Butcher would become a joke.

Lin Yun swept his glance out calmly, but didn’t notice anyone else around. It seems that they were the only ones left on the ninth trial. The others must’ve been eliminated in the trial or were eliminated by Qin An or Pei Yue.

But where was the empyrean’s legacy? Even the Astral Pearl was nowhere to be found. Before they could figure anything out, the starry sky suddenly lit up as a massive galaxy appeared above them that shined brightly above their heads.

“The ninth trial has officially come to an end and all the tunnels will be closed. Under this starry sky, the last one standing will obtain everything.” An ancient voice sounded out in Ji Wuye and Lin Yun’s ears. The voice was emotionless and was clearly left behind by the owner of the tomb.

When the voice finished speaking, the starry sky lit up as the lake reflected the stars from above. It was as though they were standing on a starry sky. At the same time, all the sects’ elders and disciples at the borders of the Withernorth Sea could see this scene.

The sky had suddenly turned dark and the starry sky at the center of the Withernorth Sea emitted a dazzling glow that lit up the entire area. Just when everyone was shocked, Lin Yun and Ji Wuye appeared within the starry sky.

“The fight for the Astral Pearl is starting!”

“This is really unbelievable. The Astral Pearl left by the ancient empyrean actually covered up the other lights. I’m afraid that once the winner is decided, the empyrean’s tomb will be destroyed.”

“How brutal. So many people entered the Withernorth Sea, but there are only two people left…”

“Ji Wuye was expected, but Lin Yun has really given us a huge surprise.” Everyone at the border of the Withernorth Sea had excitement on their faces as they never imagined that they would get to witness the fight between Lin Yun and Ji Wuye.

Although everyone had guessed that it was Lin Yun who defeated Qin An and Pei Yue, it was regrettable that they couldn’t watch it with their own eyes. But at least they could witness the fight between Lin Yun and Ji Wuye.

It was a battle between the old and new generations, and the outcome would be revealed instantaneously. Just thinking about it made their blood boil.

“What are they imagining about? Do they really think that Lin Yun can defeat Ji Wuye? How naive…” Xie Yunqiao said coldly with his brows frowned.

“He should be proud that he made it this far,” said Qin An and Pei Yue.

Even Yan Kong, who was defeated by Ji Wuye, wore a look of disdain on his face as he sneered coldly, “Is a battle without any suspense really worth anticipating?”

It wasn’t just the top ten on the outer ranking that weren’t optimistic about Lin Yun’s chances. Even Guo Xu and Yang Fan had zero hope for Lin Yun. More accurately speaking, they didn’t wish for Lin Yun to win. Lin Yun might seem to be fighting Ji Wuye, but in reality, he was challenging the entire Dragoncloud Ranking from four years ago.

The Dragoncloud Ranking was held once every four years and anyone who could make it on the ranking naturally had their name spread throughout the Ancient Southern Domain. Practically everyone knew about them, so those with a higher ranking naturally had a more influential reputation. Over the past four years, those elites were at the center of everyone’s attention.

Naturally, none of them wished to lose the spotlight. Due to the fear of being replaced, none of them wish to see Lin Yun defeat Ji Wuye, especially those who were on the top ten of the outer ranking. They could accept losing to Ji Wuye, but it would be humiliating for them if Ji Wuye was defeated by Lin Yun. It was unacceptable.

There were so many geniuses on the outer ranking gathered here, but the Astral Pearl could be taken by Lin Yun in the end. If that happened, it would be a resounding slap to their faces. They all sneered and looked down at Lin Yun. They were the most nervous group present.

“Senior sister, I’m afraid…” Liu Yunyan said weakly with a grave expression. Her words made Mo Ling smile bitterly. After all, who wasn’t nervous here?

They were all shocked by Lin Yun’s achievements - obtaining the Profound Yin Water, killing Leng Haoyu, and defeating Qin An and Pei Yue. Even with Xie Yunqiao and the others eliminated, Lin Yun was still competing.

Under the starry sky, the azure-clothed youth was at the center of everyone’s attention. The height he climbed had left a chill down everyone’s spine and they had no idea what the consequences would be if he fell down. As the saying went, the higher the climb, the greater the fall. This was especially true since Lin Yun was facing Ji Wuye.

Back in the ninth level, Ji Wuye and Lin Yun didn’t know that they would be at the center of attention. After the brief shock from the starry sky, they quickly calmed down and Ji Wuye spoke out without any emotions on his face, “Xie Yunqiao, Qin An, and Pei Yue aren’t showing up. I’m really surprised that you managed to come this far. But it’s also time for us to resolve the matter between us. Lin Yun, you’re the one who killed my junior brother, Chen Hou, right?”

When he finished questioning Lin Yun, a terrifying killing aura exploded from him. This caused everyone’s expression to change at the border of the Withernorth Sea. They were all greatly shocked by Ji Wuye’s terrifying killing aura.

“Is it that important? So many people died to your sword and you didn’t care who their senior brothers were,” said Lin Yun as he sneered inwardly.

“You’ll know if it’s important after you die!” Ji Wuye smiled because it had been a long time since anyone provoked him. In the past, others had acted just like Lin Yun, but in the end they would always beg for their lives.

“I’m afraid you won’t have the chance to get revenge,” said Lin Yun as he raised his brow. He wasn’t even afraid of Ji Wuye before coming to the empyrean’s tomb. Now that he made his breakthrough to the greater Yang stage, obtained the Azure Dragon Enneaform, and upgraded the Flower Burial Sword, he was even more fearless.

Vengeance? Ji Wuye has to ask if my Flower Burial Sword agrees.

“You’re courting death! No one dared to touch my junior brother. Not even Xie Yunqiao, Yan Kong, Qin An, or Pei Yue. They knew the consequences of offending me, Ji Wuye!” Ji Wuye’s face was extremely cold as he started releasing his bloodlust.

“Perhaps. But the world has changed over the last four years. If you’re still submerged in the dream of the past, then I’ll destroy your nickname as the Bloody Butcher today with my sword!” Lin Yun had already defeated Qin An and Pei Yue without bringing out all of his xiantian sword intent, so he naturally didn’t put Ji Wuye in his eyes.

The reason why Ji Wuye was so confident was probably because he knew the level of his sword intent. Four years had passed, so it was time for the Dragoncloud Ranking to change. His goal had never changed since leaving the Great Qin Empire. He would have a position on the Draconic Banquet and his name would spread throughout the Ancient Southern Domain!
