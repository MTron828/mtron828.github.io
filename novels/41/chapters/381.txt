Chapter 382 - Path of Killing

“Coming to die?” The three sneered when they saw Lin Yun charging at them. But after a second, they couldn’t smile anymore. Lin Yun was clearly in front of them, but they couldn’t sense him clearly with their perception. Lin Yun was like a cloud drifting around.

“He’s gone?!” The three suddenly noticed that Lin Yun went missing. Their faces changed and they began to look around cautiously.

Right at this moment, a violet sword ray appeared behind Bai Yue. Without hesitating,Bai Yue instantly drew his sword to block the attack. But when the attacks clashed, Bai Yue was sent flying and he was losing his grip on his sword.

“Damn it! What sort of power is this?!” Bai Yue was shocked. He was already in the tenth stage, but his origin energy and sword intent were weaker than Lin Yun’s. This meant that there was a huge difference in their strengths.

After Lin Yun pushed back Bai Yue, he swung his sword backwards. It was almost as if he had eyes on the back of his head. Jing Jue was trying a sneak attack, but it looked like Jing Jue had taken the initiative to dive towards Lin Yun’s sword instead. This made Jing Jue’s face change and he quickly retreated.

Taking a step forward, Lin Yun swung his sword and a sword ray flew at Mu Xiuhan who was diving down from the sky. Mu Xiuhan was in the sky, but Lin Yun had suppressed him with a blinding sword ray.

Mu Xiuhan immediately placed his sword horizontally to block the attack.

“You think you can block that so easily?” Lin Yun’s sword was like a torrential wave on a lake that was surging violently. In the next second, a storm of sword rays shot at Mu Xiuhan.

Mu Xiuhan could only defend himself as he retreated. After forty-nine swords, Lin Yun sent Mu Xiuhan flying away.

Lin Yun’s hand jolted. His sword revolved and he stabbed backwards. The tip of his sword dazzled like the star that expanded before Jing Jue’s eyes.

Once again, Lin Yun had found his weakness the instant he turned around. This made everyone wonder just what the hell was happening. But this time, Lin Yun wouldn’t give Jing Jue the opportunity to leave so quickly as he dashed forward.

Jing Jue couldn’t describe what he was feeling right now. He was covered in cold sweat when he realized that he couldn't retreat. In the end, Jing Jue unleashed a roar and swung his sword down.

But Lin Yun seemed to have expected it and pricked his sword upwards, leaving behind a cut on Jing Jue’s arm. Lin Yun attacked swiftly and the Flower Burial Sword stabbed down like a spear.

Jing Jue had done everything he could to avoid the attack, but he ultimately failed. He was stabbed in the chest and was sent flying.

A Golden Crow Seal flashed behind Lin Yun and he shuttled through the air like a golden crow. This made Mu Xiuhan and Bai Yue miss their attacks.

Before they could even react, a majestic aura that glowed brightly like a moon descended down. Many people looked at this attack with disbelief as the sword landed on Mu Xiuhan and Bai Yue’s bodies, shattering the origin energy that protected them and sending them flying.

“This…”

“This is impossible!” The two were both shocked beyond belief. They couldn’t believe that they couldn't even take a sword from Lin Yun. Not only did they fail to take that attack, it had even injured them.

Lin Yun was only in the ninth stage, so even if he was strong, it made no sense that he could defeat them so easily. Lin Yun wasn’t even so powerful in the Demonlotus Realm. Just what did he go through in the tenth stage for him to become so powerful?

“A luminous moon that blazed like fire. Just what did he do for the Aquaselenic Sword to become so powerful?”

“It’s probably because it’s in complete mastery…”

“That’s not it. He’s probably extremely close to possessing the xiantian sword intent.”

“That must be it. With a sword intent that’s extremely close to xiantian and the Aquaselenic Sword, his current strength is not so unbelievable.”

Lin Yun’s sword made the eyes of many people, who were observing the battle, light up. But when Shui Wuhen heard those words, he shook his head inwardly. They were right, but they missed something very important.

Lin Yun must have experienced something in the tenth level for him to have such confidence in his sword. There weren’t any changes to his cultivation, but his temperament had undergone a complete transformation. This was a temperament that only swordsmen could sense.

The Sword Firmament Pavilion’s party was also shocked by the battle.

“That’s the Aquaselenic Sword in complete mastery!”

“Holy shit! Lin Yun actually reached complete mastery in a transcendent spiritual grade martial technique!”

“Haha, Lin Yun is truly surprising!”

“Everyone let’s kill our way through them! For the Sword Firmament Pavilion!”

“For the Sword Firmament Pavilion!”

The Sword Firmament Pavilion’s morale surged to a level that pressured the other sects.

“Damn it! Die!” Jing Jue ignored his injury and charged at Lin Yun. He was entirely focused on attacking, ignoring his injuries. He was waiting for Lin Yun to land before cutting him into two. He refused to believe that he would fail a third time.

But when Lin Yun turned around, the flames around Jing Jue disappeared before he could even launch his attack. That was because Lin Yun’s sword was placed right at the center of his eyebrow, where blood was dripping down.

Jing Jue’s face instantly turned white as he trembled.

“Since you’re courting death, then I’ll fulfill your wish.”

“No…”

Lin Yun’s sword pierced into Jing Jue’s head before Jing Jue could finish speaking. When Lin Yun drew his sword out, he also unleashed the ultimate move of the Aquaselenic Sword, Myriad Frost!

Everything within the sword’s path was frozen, including Bai Yue and Mu Xiuhan. They were both immobilized. In the next second, the ice sculptures broke apart and the two shattered into fragments. In an instant, two monstrous geniuses had died.

“They’re dead?” Everyone was shocked because no one had expected that Lin Yun would kill the three of them. They thought that Lin Yun wouldn’t dare to kill them. However, Lin Yun acted without any hesitation.

“This…”

“That’s a swordsman’s way of slaughtering. As a swordsman, how can there be someone you don’t dare to kill? The Aquaselenic Sword is unbelievably strong in his hands. I believe he will shine brightly in the Dragon Gate Competition in the future.”

“Can it be that he already has the power to challenge the eight titles?”

“Every single one of the titles possesses the strength to kill cultivators in the Violet Palace Realm. He shouldn’t be able to do it yet, but it shouldn’t be a problem for him to reach the top ten.”

“Maybe if he reaches the tenth stage of the Profound Martial Realm by the end of the year…”

“Not likely. It’s not easy to make a breakthrough into the tenth stage. It’ll be good enough if he can reach the tenth stage of the Profound Martial Realm in two years…” Breakthroughs became more difficult in the late phases of the Profound Martial Realm.

While the spectators were shocked, the elders of the Demonflame Sect, Bloodborne Gate, and Sevendespair Palace were enraged. They were creating an opportunity to kill Lin Yun, but they never expected that they would be foiled by Lin Yun.

The eyes of the elders were filled with murderous intent. They no longer had any thoughts for the treasures and were only focused on killing Lin Yun. Otherwise, they wouldn’t be able to get rid of the hatred in their hearts.

“Maintain the formation! Don’t let them charge over!” The four sects no longer bothered dragging on with the battle. Instead, they directly charged at the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s formation. For a second, the entire battle had risen to a whole new level.

The Sword-Bearing Elder and the other elders were fighting, but the four sects had too many people. Eight deacons from the four sects charged at Lin Yun, “Brat, hand your life over!”

The eyes of the deacons had turned red. Lin Yun sheathed his sword and patted on the interspatial pouch gently to retrieve the Scarletflame War Flag. The flag instantly went into the close-combat mode.

When Lin Yun poured his origin energy into the flag, a torrential flame covered the entire flag as Lin Yun coldly looked at the deacons charging at him.

Under the Scarletflame War Flag’s influence, the entire world had turned red. If a massacre was unavoidable, then he would forge a path to the peak that was littered with blood and bones!T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m
