Chapter 497 - Indigoflame Tribulation

Looking at the mess before him, Lin Yun let out a long breath. This battle had been satisfying, but he had also exhausted half his origin energy. Ultimately, they were elite Violet Palace realm demonic beasts and they weren’t like ordinary demonic beasts.

This made Lin Yun realize that he had to reach the Violet Palace Realm. Otherwise, only death would await him. He waved his hand and stored the three beast cores. When he looked at the indigoflame in the beast cores, he turned to look at the Indigocloud Lake.

Due to the fact that the beast cores had been absorbing spiritual energy here, their beast cores also contained indigoflames, which slowly accumulated.

“I need to recover my origin energy first,” said Lin Yun as he sat on the ground. After the previous battle, no demonic beasts dared to come near the battleground.

Dozens of figures traveled through the forest as they looked around cautiously. They could occasionally see the corpses of demonic beasts and cultivators on the ground. The journey towards the Indigocloud Lake was destined to be one covered with corpses.

Bai Yi followed behind Liu Yunyan and would occasionally look behind as she bit on her lips with concern in her eyes. A long time later, she finally asked, “Senior Sister Liu, will Big Brother Lin be fine?”

The other Heavenly Province Academy’s disciples also had concern in their eyes with a complicated expression. Lin Yun’s strength had won them over and they knew the consequences if Lin Yun didn’t hold back the three demonic beasts. There would definitely be casualties in the group if Lin Yun was unsuccessful.

Their remaining journey was smootH and not many forces had a smooth journey like they did. Clearly, it was all thanks to Lin Yun. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Senior Sister, why don’t we send two disciples back to look at Lin Yun?” asked a Heavenly Province Academy’s disciple.

Liu Yunyan stopped and she looked at everyone, “Interesting. All of you had quite the opinion about him previously. So why are you guys worried about him now?”

“Senior Sister, we’re not heartless beasts…” A few disciples smiled awkwardly. They had witnessed how Lin Yun defeated four elite disciples from the Bloodwing Pavilion along with Leng Yi. So they couldn’t help to submit to Lin Yun’s strength.

The grudges between the Heavenly Province Academy and Bloodwing Pavilion have lasted for a long time, so what Lin Yun did made them feel great. So their opinions for Lin Yun had dissipated slowly.

“Are you guys stupid? He’s someone who can make Leng Yi suffer a loss with just one punch. Do you think he’ll be hindered by three demonic beasts? There’s only one reason why he hasn’t caught up right now. He must have exhausted a great deal of origin energy, so he’s recovering right now. He’ll join up with us for the final battle,” said Liu Yunyan.

“Miss Liu understands me rather well,” a voice sounded out as Lin Yun descended from the sky. He was still donned in azure clothes with a sword box behind him.

“Senior Sister, you’re really accurate!” Everyone finally felt relieved when they saw Lin Yun.

After Lin Yun refined one of the beast cores and recovered his origin energy, he could sense slight improvement in his cultivation. The indigoflame could also be used to refine his origin energy, but it was just that it wasn’t as good as the Indigoflame Goldlotuses. This made him anticipate the Indigoflame Goldlotuses even more.

“I was just casually talking about it. Wait…” Liu Yunyan was surprised by the killing aura lingering around Lin Yun and she asked, “You killed the three demonic beasts?”

Lin Yun was surprised by Liu Yunyan’s keen senses and he smiled, “I guess so.”

His words instantly dropped a bomb on the Heavenly Province Academy’s disciples as they were all shocked. In their view, it was already good that Lin Yun could return unharmed, not to mention killing the three elite demonic beasts. This was truly too unbelievable for them.

Lin Yun didn’t give any explanation. Instead, he looked at the Indigocloud Lake. “There seems to be something unusual about the Indigoflame Goldlotuses.”

“That’s right.” Liu Yunyan nodded her head and said, “the Indigoflame Goldlotuses have to undergo the tribulation of indigoflame for them to mature.”

“A tribulation?” asked Lin Yun.

“See that mountain?” Liu Yunyan pointed at the towering mountain that pierced through the clouds. Even from such a distance, they could sense the terrifying momentum at the top of the mountain.

“That’s the Indigocloud Peak. The peak has been shrouded in lightning and flame throughout the years. This is how the Indigocloud Lake was formed,” explained Liu Yunyan.

“How long until the tribulation comes?” responded Lin Yun.

“Only when the mist dissipates completely. At that time, the Indigoflame Goldlotuses will reach maturity and you’ll see a golden radiance coming from it. It’s only one step away from reaching maturity now,” said Liu Yunyan as her eyes also blazed with flames as she looked at the Indigoflame Goldlotuses. She was only one step away from completing her mission, so she was feeling rather nervous right now. She had wanted to become a core disciple for a long time now.

“There are quite a bit of Indigoflame Goldlotuses. You only need three of them, so it shouldn’t be hard,” said Lin Yun as he fell into deep thought. The area was covered with Indigoflame Goldlotuses and there were at least a hundred of them.

“You’re too optimistic. Indigoflame Goldlotuses will die from the tribulation and not many of them will survive. In the beginning, the Indigoflame Goldlotuses will cover the entire lake, but in the end there aren’t many left,” said Liu Yunyan.

With an awkward expression, Lin Yun changed the topic, “There are many people coming for it, right?”

“Those who can make it there are all experts like us,” said Liu Yunyan with a grave expression. “And we have to pay attention to some of them.”

“Who?” asked Lin Yun.

“Look north.” Lin Yun looked in the direction that Liu Yunyan pointed out and saw a group of people waiting by the lakeside for the Indigoflame Goldlotuses to mature. The one in the front was a robust man who was releasing a domineering aura.

“That’s Han Fei of the Threesolute Manor. He’s proficient with his saber and he reached the lesser Yin stage six months ago. He’s extremely terrifying. I heard that he once defeated three demonic cultivators at the same cultivation as him.”

The Threesolute Manor was also an quasi-overlord force in the Nether Prefecture and they were proficient in the art of sabers. The Threesolute Saber was a technique that shook the entire Nether Prefecture and they had a decent reputation in the entire Ancient Southern Domain.

“Over there are the Shattered Sword Pavilion’s disciples who are swordsmen like you. Their sword techniques are extremely brutal, especially the one leading the party, Nie Feng. I once fought with him and suffered a loss,” said Liu Yunyan with a grave expression.

Lin Yun was surprised and smiled, “Since you’re mentioning him, you must have already surpassed him, right?”

“You still can’t underestimate them. Aside from him, the Shattered Sword Pavilion’s disciples aren’t easy to deal with. You’re also a swordsman, so you should know how terrifying the sword aura is when they launch their charge,” said Liu Yunyan.

What she said was true. Dozens of swordsmen launching their charge and using the same sword technique was a headache.

“Who is that person then?” Lin Yun turned to look at a person standing by himself in a corner. His aura was unique and anyone could tell that he was a wandering cultivator. For him to come by himself despite so many quasi-overlord forces’ disciples here meant that he must be rather confident about his strength.

“He’s known as Ye Cangming. He came to the Nether Prefecture half a year ago, but rumor has it that he’s not a wandering cultivator, but a traitor from an overlord force. He killed many of the sect's disciples over the past six months, but no one can do anything about him,” said Liu Yunyan. As she gave an explanation, Ye Cangming looked over and revealed a sinister smile at Lin Yun.

Lin Yun fearlessly looked back at Ye Cangming. Since the latter was a traitor and survived till now, he must be somewhat capable. However, Lin Yun was someone who had slain a greater Yin stage cultivator, not to mention that his strength underwent a great change. He wouldn’t be afraid now, even if he faced a greater Yin stage cultivator. Additionally, Ye Cangming was only in the lesser Yin stage.

Ye Cangming looked at Lin Yun for a long time before he closed his eyes.

“Aside from those guys, there are also some hidden around. But I haven’t been able to discover them.” Liu Yunyan was rather cautious.

Suddenly, Lin Yun felt a chill and he looked at the direction the chill was coming from. He smiled, “Look there.”

“The Bloodwing Pavilion is here,” said Liu Yunyan with her face changed. The ones leading them were Pan Yue and Leng Yi. When the two looked at the Heavenly Province Academy’s party, they didn’t do anything and put some distance between the two parties.

The demonic beasts along the way could be considered a trial. As for those who failed to make it here, they weren’t fated with the Indigoflame Goldlotus. As time gradually passed, the mist finally disappeared.

Without any signs, the ground began to tremble, causing everyone’s faces to change. They could clearly sense the surrounding spiritual energy becoming irritated. At the same time, countless demonic beasts also began to surge out from the surroundings.

“Is the tribulation coming?” Everyone focused as they could see purple lightning and flames descending down at the Indigocloud Lake in a downpour.
