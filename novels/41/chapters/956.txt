Chapter 957 - Unconvinced

Lin Yun and Lil’ Red traveled quickly through the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm. Lin Yun could sense an aura that lingered from the ancient battles. It was especially apparent when a few people flew high into the sky and got blown to bits.

Occasionally, Lin Yun would stop by some ruins. Unfortunately, he didn’t find any treasures. On the other hand, he found paintings and engravings that gave him a rough understanding of the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm. The buildings that he stumbled into seemed to correspond with the Seven Azure Dragons Constellation. Each azure dragon had 18 stars, which meant that the constellation as a whole had 126 stars.

“If I’m understanding this correctly, there must be 126 sect inheritances. So there must be seven powerful sects to correspond to the seven azure dragons…” Lin Yun was looking at a painting and realized that the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm was a massive array constructed by 126 sects and seven powerful sects.

Since the Heavenly Path was divided into the Azure Dragon, Vermillion Bird, Black Tortoise, and White Tiger Regions, there had to be other arrays. Lin Yun could feel his scalp tingling when he thought about the reality of the Heavenly Path.

It took a while, but Lin Yun calmed down and searched the ruins to obtain more information. He discovered that 126 inheritances were buried in palaces. As for the powerful inheritances, those were buried in palaces that corresponded to the astral spirits - sun, moon, gold, wood, water, fire, and earth.

Once the powerful inheritances were activated, the most important inheritance of the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm would appear.

“I can just ignore the ordinary astral palaces. I should head towards the seven constellation palaces that correspond with the seven astral spirits.” Lin Yun made up his mind very quickly. Since he could obtain this information from random ruins, others could also find the same information. So Lin Yun didn’t bother to erase the paintings on the wall.

Two hours later, Lin Yun was forced to stop. The ground in front of him was completely destroyed as large rocks floated in the air. There seemed to be some remains at the top of the rocks, but he couldn’t see too far. There were at least tens of thousands of empyrean corpses on the stones. How many empyreans died in battle? Lin Yun wasn’t the only one shocked. The geniuses of the higher realms were also shocked by this scene.

However, their shock didn’t last too long. After all, anything related to an empyrean was a treasure, not to mention ancient empyreans. The Heavenly Astral Pearl in their bodies had immense value. On top of that, there were also dao artifacts and cultivation techniques that could have been left behind. These were unfathomable treasures.

The Heavenly Astral Pearl was a huge source of temptation for Lin Yun because he had refined one in the past. Although the effect would be greatly reduced if he refined another, it was still a useful treasure.

“I should take a look. After all, it’s not easy to run into such a valuable place,” said Lin Yu. Next, he jumped onto a rock and saw a corpse standing upright. When he gently touched the corpse, it dissipated into dust.

“Time is ruthless…” sighed Lin Yun. After all, inheritances left behind by empyreans and those who died in battle couldn’t be compared. Very quickly, the enthusiasm of everyone around Lin Yun started to die down. However, no one was willing to give up.

As Lin Yun landed on another rock, the corpse that was on dissipated before he could move. But surprisingly, a sword was plunged into the stone that didn’t dissipate with the corpse.

“This…” Lin Yun was surprised because this was a rare situation.

“Ancient dao artifact!” A voice broke out from behind Lin Yun. When he turned around, he saw a skinny figure in gray quietly landing on the rock. The newcomer had an eerie gaze full of danger.

Lin Yun was alarmed because he underestimated how hidden geniuses were present. He only managed to discover the newcomer’s presence after they got close together. Clearly, this person was a lot more troublesome than Liu Mu.

“Who are you?” Lin Yun asked.

The gray-clothed youth ignored Lin Yun’s question and looked at the sword, “You’re really lucky to come across an ancient dao artifact. It looks like there are a lot of treasures here.”

Sensing the killing intent in Lin Yun’s eyes, the gray-clothed youth smiled, “I don’t use swords and the dao rhyme in this ancient dao artifact is more or less gone. I won’t compete with you for it. I’m more interested in you. It’s a miracle that a genius from the Profound Amber Realm got this far. But you’re still lacking. Forget about the end of the Heavenly Path, I’m afraid that you won’t even do anything noteworthy in the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm…”

“What are you trying to say?” Lin Yun asked.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“The final competition at the end of the Heavenly Path will start in half a year. It’s difficult to reach the end, but at the very least, you need to make your name appear on the Heavenly Path Mirror,” said the gray-clothed youth.

“It shouldn’t be difficult to appear on the Heavenly Path Mirror,” said Lin Yun. “At the very least, those on the Azure Dragon Ranking should be on the Heavenly Path Mirror.”

“You’re right,” said the gray-clothed youth. “Their names appear, but their names don’t shine. Only the names of the strong will shine brightly. If your name isn’t bright enough, you’ll be swallowed by the others. It’s the same as getting eliminated. Think about it, there’s only about a hundred people who are qualified to compete at the end.”

Lin Yun was surprised because this was the first time he heard of this. After all, it was brutal to imagine that out of millions of people, only 100 could be chosen.

“Surprised?” The gray-clothed youth smiled, “The ones who accept us at the end of the Heavenly Path are the powerful sects of the Kunlun Realm. Even many Kunlun Realm’s geniuses can’t make it into those sects. So if we don’t have enough potential, why would those sects choose us? As for you… you’re still lacking. You might be shining right now, but who knows if you’ll even reach the end? You wouldn’t know since you haven’t even seen how terrifying the top-tier experts of the Heavenly Path are.”

“Why are you telling me all of this?” Lin Yun asked.

“I want you to realize the difference between you and the top-tier geniuses. Fighting by yourself won’t get you far. But you might have a chance if you work with me,” replied the gray-clothed youth.

Join hands? Lin Yun understood what was going on. It looks like his battle with Liu Mu caught people’s attention.

“Are you looking down on my strength?” The gray-clothed youth sneered when he sensed Lin Yun’s hesitation, “I nearly snatched the Glorygold Spirit. I have trump cards just like you. With us joining forces, we could even face the owners of the astral spirits.”

Knowing that this person misunderstood him, Lin Yun explained, “I’m not looking down on you. It’s just that I’m used to being alone, but I don’t mind being friends. I won’t act against you unless there’s a treasure I really need. Furthermore, I’m really grateful for the information you shared with me. However, I don’t believe that geniuses from the lower realms don’t stand a chance!” Lin Yun’s heart as a swordsman never wavered. He refused to believe that he had to stand below the others.

“Interesting.” Sensing Lin Yun’s stubbornness, the gray-clothed youth smiled, “I was afraid of scaring you, but it seems that I didn’t explain myself well. It’s best for you to get a grip with reality or else you’ll burn out. Well then, good luck.”

The gray-clothed youth instantly fated Lin Yun with death upon seeing Lin Yun’s stubbornness. “Oh, by the way, my name is Chen Xun. This place is shattered, so you can imagine how brutal the fight must have been. That means there’s nothing good here. You should stop wasting your time and head for the constellation palaces. I’ll be leaving first.”

Lin Yun looked at Lil’ Red who was on his shoulder and smiled, “He's really looking down on me…”

Then again, Chen Xun had the qualification to look down on him. After all, he was someone who competed for the Glorygold Spirit and was a lot stronger than the likes of Liu Mu. But why did Lin Yun feel so unhappy? Lin Yun narrowed his eyes and smiled. The constellations? Don’t worry, I’ll be there!
