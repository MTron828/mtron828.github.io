Chapter 1447 - Envy (1)

The stone gate shut itself with a bang when Lin Yun entered the Nether Palace. The commotion made him hurriedly look back, but he noticed that the gate was tightly shut, and he couldn’t move the gate no matter how hard he tried.

Did that mean that he was trapped inside? Or did he have to find another way to leave this chamber? Lin Yun wasn’t too nervous because his third senior brother wouldn’t have let him in if this place could trap him to death.

“Haha! Someone’s here again…” A hoarse voice resounded just when Lin Yun was in shock.

When Lin Yun quickly turned his head around, he saw a grey-clothed elder examining him at the far end of the chamber with his face covered in wrinkles.

“Senior, you’re…?” Lin Yun asked politely.

“You wish to learn the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra?” The old man didn’t answer Lin Yun and gave him a question instead.

Lin Yun remained silent and nodded as he took out the metal representing his status as a heaven direct disciple. This place was weird, and he could sense a powerful seal within this stone chamber; no energy could penetrate this room. Regardless of his sword intent or soul energy, they couldn’t leave the walls and felt like they had been trapped in the room.

“I hope that you won’t regret it in the future. Wait…” The old man’s face suddenly changed, staring at Lin Yun with wide eyes. He wore a grave expression and said, “Why do you have the Radiant Sword Saint’s aura on you.”

“Is it because of this?” Lin Yun briefly pondered before taking out the painting his master left for him. This was meant to ensure his safety, and it could summon a clone of the Radiant Sword Saint upon unfolding it. But it was weird that this old man could sense it when this painting wasn’t opened.

“You’re his disciple?” The old man’s expression became more gentle upon seeing the painting.

“Yeah.” Lin Yun nodded.

The old man was stunned before he smiled, “Then you should call me Martial Uncle. I’m his Junior Brother.”

Lin Yun was shocked because this old man’s seniority was higher than he had imagined. If he remembered correctly, the six saint lords addressed the Radiant Sword Saint as Martial Uncle.

“This disciple here greets Martial Uncle!” Lin Yun cupped his hands together.

“Haha. Senior Brother is finally willing to take in a disciple. You can call me Dustlight.” The old man’s expression became more amicable, and he continued, “You should know about the special characteristics of the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra, right?”

“I do. I know it’s hard to grasp, and it’s practically impossible to enter the threshold before reaching the Dragon Pulse Realm.” Lin Yun nodded.

“But you don’t know the reason why, right?” The old man smiled. “When the Sword Sect was still a holy land, there were nine sword sutras, and the nine sword sutras all came from the Great Profound Sword Canon. Upon reaching a high level in any of the nine sword sutras, one could comprehend the Great Profound Sword Canon.” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts and wondered if any martial or cultivation techniques with ‘canon’ in the name were much more profound than others.

“Two sword sutras were lost amongst the nine sword sutras.” The old man continued, “Amongst the seven remaining sword sutras, two mainly consist of controlling spiritual runes. So they’re inherited by the Profound Firmament and Emerald Firmament Peaks.”

The two lost sword sutras should be due to Yu Qingfeng, who sliced off the two peaks. But Lin Yun didn’t say a word as he listened to the old man’s story.

“Amongst the five remaining sword sutras, the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra is the hardest, and the difficulty lies in the word ‘Nether’!” The old man briefly paused before he continued, “It is said that the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra was created by the Sword Sect’s ancestor in the Nether Sea with his comprehension of the Great Profound Sword Canon as the foundation. The Nether Sea was a dead sea with rarely any forms of life living in it. But some ominous beasts coud still survive in the sea, and they’re called nether beasts, as a collective. There were also rumors that one could travel to hell at the other end of the sea.”

“Does that sea still exist today?” Lin Yun asked.

“It’s gone.” The old man sighed. “When the Golden Era ended, that sea was a battleground for the gods. So it was completely destroyed, and is now a forbidden region. Even saints won’t dare to carelessly step into that region. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be so hard to grasp the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra.”

“Oh?” Lin Yun asked curiously.

Looking at Lin Yun, the old man replied, “When the Sword Sect was still a holy land, disciples would head to the Nether Sea if they wanted to cultivate the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra. It’s a lot easier to form the Netherflower there, and it wasn’t as difficult as it is now.”

“Netherflower?” Lin Yun was puzzled upon hearing that.

“That’s right. You can only grasp the nether energy by forming the Netherflower. It’s the power of death that can erode vitality.” The old man smiled. “I don’t recommend practicing this sword sutra. As a heaven direct disciple, it’s not an issue for you to practice the sword sutras of the other peaks.”

Lin Yun didn’t know that it was possible, but he also had no interest in the other sword sutras. As a disciple of the Divine Firmament Peak, it would be weird if he cultivated the other sword sutras of the other peaks.

“Thank you for your advice, Martial Uncle. But I’ve already made up my mind.” Lin Yun said with a grave expression.

“I only talked so much to you because you’re my martial nephew. But I won’t interfere in your decisions.” The old man noticed Lin Yun’s determination and no longer tried to persuade him. He took out a black jade slip and handed it over. “Here. The mantra for the first three stages is recorded on it.”

“Only three stages?” Lin Yun was puzzled.

“Haha. Come and look for me when you form the Netherflower and the sword seed born in the bud. I’m looking forward to seeing you again,” replied the old man.

Lin Yun nodded. But just when he was about to leave, he couldn’t help asking, “Martial Uncle, is this place sealing something?”

“Haha. I’ll tell you everything if we meet again. As for now, I can’t tell you much, even if you’re my Senior Brother’s disciple.” The old man didn’t explain much and left Lin Yun in suspense.

This made Lin Yun curious about what sort of existence was being sealed there that required his martial uncle to stay there.

“Then, I’ll be taking my leave now.” Lin Yun bowed. As the old man waved his hand, the stone gate gently opened and a black light shone out. When Lin Yun came out of the stone chamber, he was immediately surrounded by a group of people.

“Senior Brother Lin, you really chose the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra?”

“It’s impossible to cultivate the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra. This is a huge abyss!”

“Senior Brother, this sword sutra is poisonous. There’s no way it can be cultivated.” The surrounding people were trying to persuade Lin Yun, but this only made Lin Yun feel awkward as he bitterly smiled. It looks like the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra was so unpopular that even the Divine Firmament Peak disciples were saying this. Then again, they could do nothing because it was hard to cultivate after the Nether Sea shattered.

“You’re out? Have you seen our martial uncle?” Mu Chuan smiled.

“I did.” Lin Yun nodded as he showed the black jade slip.
