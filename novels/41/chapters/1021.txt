Chapter 1022 - Great Changes

After four hours passed, Nie Xuan finally arrived at the scene of the battle. There were no signs of any corpses, but the entire region was stained with blood. Nie Xuan’s eyes blazed with rage as he roared, “Lin Yun!”

The terrifying killing aura coming from him made the surroundings tremble violently. It was the rage of a general from the Nether Divinity War Realm. At this moment, he was regretting that he sent his men to deal with Lin Yun.

On a nearby mountain, many people were looking at the bloodstained region with fear. Then, they watched as purple light shines from the runes in Nie Xuan’s aura oceans.

He was only in the fourth soul Heavenly Soul Realm, but he had a pressure that was much greater than that. It was only possible with the foundation of a war realm. After all, only the war realms had secret techniques to plant runes in aura oceans for stabilization.

It empowered their spiritual runes to suppress those at the same cultivation level. To achieve this, it required an immense amount of resources. So without sufficient treasures, any amount of effort was useless.

Nie Xuan released his pressure to search for Lin Yun’s tracks. But even after four hours, he wasn’t able to track Lin Yun. Realizing that Lin Yun had fled, Nie Xuan snarled, “You better run!”

After a while, three figures arrived whose aura was equal to Nie Xuan.

“Whoa… were they searching for Lin Yun nearby?”

“Looks like we’re at the right place. The Nether Divinity War Realm is responsible for this region. He acts so arrogantly even with the four generals around.”

“How ruthless.” Everyone took in a cold breath when they saw the four generals.

“Big Brother!” Nie Xuan said with a grave expression. He was referring to Nie Tian of the four generals, who nodded his head, “Are you certain that they were killed by Lin Yun?”

“I’m sure of it. They gave me the news that they found Lin Yun before I arrived here. But…” Nie Xuan’s face was ugly when he replied. All of his subordinates were dead, which was a ruthless slap to the Nether Divinity War Realm’s face.

“That bastard is taking this too far! A bastard from the lower realm dares to be so arrogant?!” The three generals were upset because the Nether Divinity War Realm was being humiliated.

After all, it was unprecedented for anyone from the war realm to die. Although their servants were killed, they still belonged to the war realms.

“Let’s have the Realm Sons make a decision,” replied Nie Xuan. The three war realms joined hands to seal off the region, but the Realm Sons couldn’t wander around because they were controlling an array. But now that something so important happened, a Realm Son had to make a move. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

An hour later, a ray of light suddenly shined in the sky as a figure walked out of the clouds. He was enveloped in a saintly luster, so no one could see his face.

“Greetings, young master!” The generals were shocked that the Realm Son arrived so fast.

“Pass along my order. Anyone who finds Lin Yun will be rewarded with 1,000 Divine Astral pellets. Anyone who can injure him will be rewarded ten Saint Pellets. Anyone who can kill him will receive dao armor and a promise from me!” His voice was calm, but chilly.

The entire Yellow Sandy Plain was shocked by the Nether Divinity Realm Son because this was the first time one of the Ten War Realms had issued a bounty. Although everyone was tempted by the reward, they didn’t dare to make a move towards Lin Yun.

They weren’t sure if they could kill Lin Yun, but a promise from a Realm Son was unimaginable. Then again, there were also those who ignored the reward because they didn’t have a favorable opinion of the Ten War Realms. After all, the war realms had thoroughly enraged them by sealing off the entire Yellow Sandy Plain.

The Nether Divinity Realm Son descended from the sky and continued, “The four of you are to stick together from now on. If you run into him, focus on holding him back until I arrive.”

“Young master!” The faces of the four generals changed because this was a sign that the Realm Son no longer trusted them.

“Young master, he’s just an ant. There’s no need for you to make a move yourself. The four of us can kill him by ourselves,” said Nie Xuan.

“I want him alive,” replied the Realm Son. Although no one could see his face, everyone could sense the killing aura in his tone.

Right at this moment, two more people walked out from the clouds who also emitted a terrifying aura. It was the Elysium Trigram Realm Son and the Profound Dragon Realm Son.

“That brat is taking it too far,” said the Elysium Trigram Realm Son with rage in his voice. Previously, Lin Yun had only injured the Profound Lightning Twin Swords. But now, he actually dared to kill geniuses from the war realms.

Naturally, they were allowed to deal with Lin Yun. However, Lin Yun wasn’t allowed to deal with them.

“I found out some information on him. He came from the Profound Amber Realm, which is the same realm as that woman. It seems like she will appear because they have a deep relationship,” said the Profound Dragon Realm Son. When he said that, the two other Realm Sons became happy.

Right at this moment, the Nether Divinity Realm Son replied, “It looks like we really have to catch him.”

While discussing, they used the Time-Turning Mirror to replay Lin Yun’s fight. They were shocked by Lin Yun’s ferocity and the massacre that unfolded. Although they couldn’t see the Nether Divinity Realm Son’s face, they could sense his aura tremble.

“Impudence!” A roar rang out along with a boundless aura. The sudden pressure made cracks spread out on the ground. When the cracks reached the top of several tall mountains, they collapsed on top of themselves.

The audience felt a little bit of despair because they weren’t on the same level as the Nether Divinity Realm Son. They couldn’t even begin to imagine how terrifying the Realm Son’s attack would be.

“The Divine Glorymoon Fist shouldn’t be this powerful,” said the Elysium Trigram Realm Son. The Divine Glorymoon Fist had also appeared in the past, so he was familiar with it. It was a powerful fortune martial technique, but definitely not as powerful as the one Lin Yun used.

“Perhaps this is related to that region. No wonder he went for the Lunar Soul Herb.” The Profound Dragon Realm Son’s eyes flickered with thought. Then, the three of them turned to look at the Demonic Wolf Clan, but they didn’t head over. They could sense that there were several elder wolves who had reached the pinnacle of the Heavenly Soul Realm. Although they were Realm Sons, they didn’t dare to provoke the elder wolves.

“The Lunar Soul Herbs aren’t that strong though. His growth is a little strange. We need to kill him because we can’t keep him around. If we don’t, he’ll give us trouble in the future,” said the Nether Divinity Realm Son. He was implying that Lin Yun could grasp a holy spirit martial technique.

“He was dead the moment he ran into us,” said the Elysium Trigram Realm Son.

The Profound Dragon Realm Son squinted his eyes, “I’m interested in his Azure dragon True Bone. It’s a waste for such a treasure to go to him.”

The crowd felt shivers when they heard the conversation of the Realm Sons. They knew that there would be no peace in the Yellow Sandy Plain anymore.
