Chapter 1536 - Martial Brothers!

Feng Jue was covered in blood and tightly bound by the fishing line, with the hook digging into his rib. This made Lin Yun widen his mouth with shock before his pupils were filled with rage.

“Junior Brother, leave quickly! He’s Jin Jue, and he’s here to kill you!” Feng Jue was damp when he was pulled out from the lake, but he couldn’t be bothered by that and yelled at Lin Yun.

Lin Yun’s face changed as a face appeared within his mind. On the Heavenly Path, Jin Jue stopped all the sects from picking him and nearly forced him into a dead end. But Lin Yun never expected that he would run into Jin Jue here.

“Since you’re already here, why bother running?” Jin Jue revealed a sinister smile under the hood and swung the fishing rod out, sending Jin Jue flying over to Lin Yun. But Lin Yun quickly avoided Feng Jue, who fell onto the ground, creating a huge crater.

“It has been a long time, and your movement technique has improved significantly. Try again!” Jin Jue smiled as he swung the fishing rod once more. Just like that, Feng Jue was like a toy in Jin Jue’s hand, flying towards Lin Yun, creating one crater after another on the ground.

This made Lin Yun so furious that his entire body began to tremble, and his pupils were filled with hatred. Jin Jue was clearly trying to mess with him, but there was nothing he could do about it. Just when he was briefly distracted, Feng Jue slammed into him and he was sent flying away.

“Flower Burial, where’s your grace when you fought the ten realm sons back on the Heavenly Path?” Jin Jue removed his bamboo hat and revealed an eerie smile.

Lin Yun clutched his chest with his face pale as blood flowed down his lips.

“You better leave quickly or die when my master comes!” Lin Yun threatened while he was finding a way to resolve this crisis. But there was nothing he could do to a King.

“The Radiant Sword Saint?” Jin Jue snickered. “You think I’m a fool? If the Radiant Sword Saint can descend, do you think I’d make a move against you? Hahaha!”

As he laughed, his eyes were filled with mockery. When he was done laughing, he continued, “I already know of your tracks when you left the sect three months ago.”

The corner of Lin Yun’s lips twitched. It turned out that Jin Jue had been eyeing him right from the beginning.

“But it’s a pity that fool Qin Cang is frightened after being defeated by you.” Jin Jue’s pupils were filled with unhappiness when he mentioned Qin Cang. Not only was Qin Cang not willing to make a move against Lin Yun, he even warned Jin Jue against making a move against Lin Yun. Jin Jue didn’t think that a fool like Qin Cang could have any significant accomplishment in the future since he only had Tian Xuanzi in his eyes and not the Nether Divinity Clan and gave up such a great opportunity.

“Why do you think I would be waiting here and not make a move before you reached the Dragon Remnant Astral Realm?” Jin Jue suddenly laughed. “I never thought that Qin Cang not making a move would have helped me, instead. Otherwise, I would’ve lost my life when I made a move against you.”

“You’ve been following me?” Lin Yun instantly figured it all out.

“Haha. Not bad. Here’s a reward for you!” Jin Jue laughed and threw the bamboo hat like a frisbee.

This made Lin Yun squint his eyes and duck. This time, it was a close call.

“Mhm?” Jin Jue was surprised. “Not bad, but there’s no meaning in that.”

When he was done, he pushed his palm forth, and a terrifying pressure swept out, shattering Lin Yun’s dragon runes. This made Lin Yun throw out a mouthful of blood and fall to one knee.

“Not bad. No wonder why you can leave with the Divine Dragon Bone with so many demonic sects around.” Jin Jue’s eyes flashed with greed as he looked at Lin Yun’s dragon runes and his chest. This could be considered a surprise harvest. After all, even as a King, he was tempted by the Blue Dragon Bone.

“Old geezer, you can target me alone, sp let my senior brother go!” Lin Yun roared.

“Haha, what are you talking about?” Jin Jue’s pupils flashed with mockery. “He’s your martial guardian, and I spent a great deal of effort to fish him out. So how can I let him go so easily?”

Martial guardian? Lin Yun looked at Feng Jue. Feng Jue had shame on his face, and his face was ugly. He instantly understood what was going on. His master probably got Feng Jue to follow him and secretly protect him.

With Feng Jue’s strength, he could even suppress an ordinary King. After all, he was the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple. But he never expected that he would run into Jin Jue. The latter had long reached the Samsara Edict Realm, and his talent and resources weren’t any weaker than Feng Jue. So it was expected that he couldn’t defeat Jin Jue.

“Let him go, and I’ll follow you to the Nether Divinity Clan.” Lin Yun calmly looked at Jin Jue. “A living person is better than a dead person. If I decide to suicide, you won’t be able to get the Blue Dragon Bone. So you better consider it well.”

His words made Jin Jue’s eyes flicker. Lin Yun’s threat was effective; as Lin Yun said, a living person was better than a dead person. The Nether Divinity Clan naturally wanted Lin Yun captured alive.

“Haha, your words do make sense.” Jin Jue replied. “This piece of trash has no value to me, to begin with!”

He couldn’t be bothered with Feng Jue’s life and death. He soon made his decision and walked towards Lin Yun, wanting to seal off Lin Yun’s cultivation. “Don’t play any tricks with me.”

“You bastard! Don’t touch my junior brother!” Feng Jue’s pupils became bloodshot as he struggled back up to charge at Jin Jue.

But Jin Jue didn’t even bat an eye at him and sent Feng Jue flying with a slap, instead. He mocked, “You dare call yourself a disciple of the Radiant Sword Saint with this strength? What an embarrassment to the Radiant Sword Saint.”

As he mocked, he didn’t stop walking towards Lin Yun. Looking at Lin Yun, Jin Jue laughed, “Feeling despair now? But this is how the world works. Don’t blame me for bullying you. If I don’t bully you now, will I wait until you’re strong enough to kill me?”

He knew that even if the Nether Divinity Clan had no intentions of killing Lin Yun, he had to find an opportunity to do it himself. If a talent like Lin Yun grows up in the future, it would far exceed his imagination, and he had never underestimated Lin Yun’s talent.

“Leave! Don’t touch my junior brother!” Feng Jue charged over once more. He couldn’t move his arms, so he could only charge over with his body. He had no hesitation in doing so because Lin Yun was his junior brother.

His master instructed him to take good care of Lin Yun because the latter was the Sword Sect’s hope. He knew Lin Yun wasn’t a piece of trash like him but a genius with talent on par with Jian Jingtian. So he couldn’t allow Lin Yun to die here, even if he died. But before he could get close, Jin Jue sent Feng Jue flying again with a slap.

“Jin Jue, stop!” Lin Yun’s emotions were running out of control.𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“So what if I kill him? What can you do? You’re no different from an ant in my eyes.” Jin Jue mocked and pushed his palm in Feng Jue’s direction, piercing through Feng Jue’s chest. Feng Jue’s vitality began to fall.

“Screw you!” Lin Yun finally lost it and charged at Jin Jue.

“Another movement from you, and I’ll kill him!” Jin Jue suddenly roared. When he saw Lin Yun coming to a stop, he snickered, “Kneel!”

“Kill me!” Lin Yun gritted his teeth. “I won’t kneel for anyone except my master in this lifetime!”

“Pretty stubborn.” A cold light flashed across Jin Jue’s pupils as his aura crashed down on Lin Yun. He didn’t like Lin Yun’s pride. Lin Yun was clearly at his mercy, but Lin Yun had no intention to beg him for mercy, which made Jin Jue unhappy.

Lin Yun naturally couldn’t withstand the aura of a King, and his knees began to crackle as if they would snap in the next second. This scene made Jin Jue sneer as he increased his aura on Lin Yun.

But just when Lin Yun was about to reach his limit, a boundless divine aura exploded from behind him. Lil’ Purple then flew out from the sword box with the divine runes on her forehead flying out, “You want him to kneel before you? Did you ask me for my opinion?”

Jin Jue was shocked by this scene. When he raised his head, the Azure Dragon Divine Rune and Phoenix Divine Rune were like shackles that flew towards him. This made Jin Jue squint his eyes, and his first reaction was to retreat.

But he was ultimately one step slower. The two divine runes caught up to him and restricted him.

“Kneel!” Lil’ Purple roared, and an ancient aura from the ice phoenix exploded, forcing Jin Jue down on his knees with a groan.

This instantly made Jin Jue panic because he couldn’t see through Lil’ Purple’s origin.
