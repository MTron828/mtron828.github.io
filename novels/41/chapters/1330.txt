Chapter 1331 - Qin Cang Makes a Move

Ning Feng was feeling depressed that he was actually being suppressed by Ye Ziling despite being a fated transcendent. Ye Ziling’s bloodline was terrifying. When the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords was empowered by her bloodline, it unleashed an entirely different power than when Lin Yun used it.

When the Radiant Snow Flower bloomed, it looked ancient and powerful, containing both the dao of ice and lightning. Furthermore, both of them were fused to an unbelievable height.

Aside from that, Ye Ziling also had a strong attainment in the sword, and she could easily execute the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords in the Manifestation Stage. Even if she couldn’t bring out the true holy spirit of the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords, the power of it still reached a terrifying height, far surpassing holy spirit martial techniques that were at the same level.

Ning Feng could sense that Ye Ziling’s potential had far exceeded Sikong Zhou's. She only lacked time, but she given her strong foundation, her potential could continue to be excavated. He was only able to barely turn the tables around by relying on his foundation as a fated transcendent and the ancient armor he was wearing.

But before he could rejoice, the human cannonball, Dugu Yan, was already flying in his direction. Before Ning Feng could think more about it, he instantly summoned his constellation and a painting unfolded behind him. But even so, the impact still made Ning Feng let out a groan. Before he could catch his breath, Ye Ziling had charged forth with her sword once more. When he took Ye Ziling’s attack head-on, he threw out a mouthful of blood with his face turning pale.

“Get lost!” At the same time, Nangong Ze was also sent flying by Su Ziyao’s sword.

“Aren’t these two bitches a little too terrifying?” Nangong Ze and Ning Feng stood together with their faces ugly.

Hearing that, Ning Feng mocked, “Weren’t you mocking me earlier?”

The outcome of the fight between the four fated transcendents and the four from the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect had caused a series of exclamations. Although this wasn’t a life and death battle, the four fated transcendents were reduced to jokes in just half an hour.

This had exceeded everyone’s expectations. They never expected that a tiny Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect would have such huge potential. Meanwhile, Dugu Yan was being toyed with by Lin Yun, kneeling three times before he was thrown away.

Dugu Yan had shame written on his face, looking incredibly ugly, which made him throw out another mouthful of blood to worsen his injuries. The majority of his injuries weren’t from Lin Yun but Ning Feng, nearly leaving him heavily injured.

“Where’s Zhang Jin?” Nangong Ze changed the topic. When the three looked in Zhang Jin’s direction, they had sympathetic looks. Facing Lil’ Red, who had taken on the Ancient Dracoape form, Zhang Jin was practically receiving a one-sided beating.

Lil’ Red was simply too ruthless and even grasped a bizarre origin saint rune that could devour his saint rune. So he was completely being restricted by Lil’ Red and couldn’t even bring out one-third of his strength.

This instantly made the faces of those from the powerful sects become ugly, especially the disciples from the Thunder Sect. Did it make sense that their fated transcendent couldn’t even defeat a mere cat? But just when they were about to step forth to help, a cold sword ray flew over that instantly destroyed the talisman that the Thunder Sect’s Greater Elysium Core Realm had unleashed.

“Sikong Zhou!” That old man flew into a rage as he raised his head with his face dark.

“Do you think that the Sword Sect is invisible? It’s already shameless for three sects to join hands. Don’t tell me that you want to gang up?” Sikong Zhou replied. No matter what, the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect was considered a branch of the Sword Sect, so Sikong Zhou naturally couldn’t accept Lin Yun being ganged up on by them.

“Very good. You’ve successfully piqued my interest!” A voice resounded, coming from Qin Cang. Seeing that Qin Cang might make a move, Ye Ziling and Su Ziyao stopped and stood beside Lin Yun.

“Finally going to make a move? That fellow killed a realm son of your Nether Divinity Clan,” muttered Nangong Ze with a weird expression.

“The Nether Divinity Clan wants his life, but what does that have to do with me, Qin Cang? I only have eyes for the Profound Sky Sect. Seeing that he’s indeed the strongest genius of the Heavenly Paths and even Dugu Yan is nothing before him, I have no choice but to help myself to him,” smiled Qin Cang. He was a decisive person and didn’t hesitate. Just when everyone was still pondering about what he said, Qin Cang had already soared to the sky.

Qin Cang turned into a blur in mid-air while dashing forth. Seeing that Qin Cang had immediately charged over, everyone was instantly shocked. Qin Cang’s abrupt action had caught everyone by surprise. After all, he didn’t show any interest in Lin Yun just a moment ago.

But when he made a move, not even the disciples of the Profound Sky Sect had predicted it. This made a cold light flash through Ye Ziling’s pupils, but she didn’t think much about it and turned into a dragon to try and stop Qin Cang. When Qin Cang approached, the saint sword in her hand trembled and was aimed at Qin Cang’s chest.

After reaching the Elysium Core Realm and refining an origin saint rune, her strength had undergone a drastic transformation. In her hands, the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords had been transformed.

“A mere ant making a futile effort!” Qin Cang snorted before he raised his palm and pushed forth. Before his palm landed on Ye Ziling, Ye Ziling was already sent flying back and threw out a mouthful of blood.

“Lin Yun, you want to hide behind a woman?” Qin Cang coldly smiled. His aura grew even more majestic. But Lin Yun had no fluctuation in his emotions. The other party was ranked first on the Empyrean Ranking, and his strength was unfathomable even after reaching the Elysium Core Realm.

Ever since he appeared in public, he had not lost a single battle. Amongst those in the same generation, not many people could take a palm from him and come out unscathed. Ye Ziling was naturally trying to help Lin Yun by testing Qin Cang’s strength; however, she never expected that the gap between them would be so huge.

“Take care of Ziling,” said Lin Yun before he ignited all the Demonic Astral Flowers in his aura ocean. As one golden flower after another flew from his body, they formed a barrier that had enveloped him. At the same time, he also swiftly unleashed his attack with three thousand purple-golden dragon runes pouring into his palm and manifested into a dragon claw.

As Lin Yun and Qin Cang clashed, they both retreated. But Qin Cang merely took one step back while Lin Yun took ten-odd steps back before he managed to stabilize himself.

That’s the rumored Azure Dragon Saint Art? Qin Cang knew that if it wasn’t for that body-refining technique, he could easily suppress Lin Yun with just one palm.

“Back then, Sikong Zhou was defeated by me with one palm. So I’m really curious to see how many palms you can take!” After Qin Cang stabilized himself, he raised his hands and smiled. “The Dragon Clan’s body-refining techniques are famous throughout the world. Coincidentally, I just so happen to be somewhat proficient in one as well.”

As Qin Cang slowly raised his hands, his vitality began to surge and released a golden glow from his body, making him look like a golden statue. At the same time, a dragon roar echoed and a true dragon aura that was within his body began to rise with a golden dragon appearing from him.

“Golden Dragon Skypatching Art!” Qin Cang roared before he charged forth. Like a golden dragon, this boosted his speed even more. The Golden Dragon Skypatching Art was a profound body-refining technique of the Dragon Clan that was grasped by the Divine Dragon Empire. After the Qin Clan was bestowed the title of Nether Divinity, the Divine Dragon Empire bestowed the Golden Dragon Skypatching Art upon the Qin Clan. This was why Qin Cang had the opportunity to practice this body-refining technique.

Moreover, it wasn’t only a body-refining technique but a complete martial technique that consisted of sword, palm, finger, and fist techniques. But not even the Divine Dragon Empire had the complete version of the Golden Dragon Skypatching Art, which makes it famous in the Ancient Barren Domain.

After Qin Cang executed the Golden Dragon Skypatching Art, he threw out a punch, and his punch formed into a dragon claw. At the same time, countless golden dragons flew from his body, creating a picture of myriad soaring dragons.

Then again, it just showed how majestic this scene was. There weren’t really a myriad of dragons. But even so, this scene was shocking enough. Lin Yun could sense that his Azure Dragon Saint Art was being suppressed.

This was the first time the Azure Dragon Saint Art had encountered this situation. Since he was caught unaware by this scene, he took a punch to his chest and the pain was intense despite having the Azure Dragon Mark.

“Not bad. You’re actually still alive after taking a punch from me. Since that’s the case, then take another punch from me!” Qin Cang’s eyes blazed with flames, making his blood boil with excitement. He was invincible in the Ancient Barren Domain for too long with no opponents on the Empyrean Ranking. So it had been many years since he fought for real.

Even someone as strong as Sikong Zhou could only take one palm from him, so there was no meaning in him making a move. He was lonely after being invincible for too long. At times, he would even wonder how good it would be if Jian Jingtian wasn’t born so early. If that was the case, then he might be able to have an opponent.

Now, he was excited after seeing Lin Yun. He was even thinking if he should let Lin Yun go for now and wait till Lin Yun reached the Elysium Core Realm before they fought again. As for the rage of the Nether Divinity Clan, what did it have to do with him?

After making up his mind, he opened his fist to a palm and attacked Lin Yun. He was going to teach Lin Yun a lesson so that he could come back stronger in the future.

“Golden Dragon Skyopening Palm!” When he changed his fist to a palm, his aura exploded, manifesting into a heavenly seal. Qin Cang wanted to use this move to teach Lin Yun that there was always someone stronger out there!

After taking a loss earlier, Lin Yun did not dare to be careless and ignited the Blood Flame Divine Rune in the Azure Dragon Mark. When three thousand purple-golden dragon runes blazed, they came to life and Lin Yun executed the Azure Dragon Grasp.

As the azure dragon released a roar, countless thunderstorms began to gather on his palm before he pushed it against Qin Cang. Looking from afar, their attacks looked like two dragons colliding together. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

But this time, Qin Cang was sent flying back while Lin Yun remained where he stood. Before the crowd could exclaim, Lin Yun reached out and the Lightning Shadow Sword flew into his hand.

When Lin Yun grabbed onto the Lightning Shadow Sword, a pair of golden wings unfolded behind him, instantly making the sky turn dark. Lin Yun flew towards Qin Cang and activated the divine rune in the Lightning Shadow Sword before swinging it at Qin Cang’s right hand.

This made Qin Cang’s face change before he pushed his left palm against the Lightning Shadow Sword. When the palm and sword tip collided, sparks flew out and Lin Yun was sent flying back under this palm.

Meanwhile, Qin Cang also took this opportunity to pull back his right hand. When he landed on the ground, he was still feeling shocked and raised his left hand to see blood dripping down from his palm. Just a moment ago, his entire right hand was nearly severed. He had never been in such danger before.
