Chapter 2090: Scumbag

Not long after Wang Muyan left, Lin Yun’s medal as a Great Saint’s disciple bloomed in radiance. As it hovered in mid-air, the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint’s voice resounded from the medal, “Come quickly to the Profound Maiden Courtyard.”

Lin Yun instantly knew that the Serene Dust Great Saint and Heavenly Jade Sword Saint have returned. Fifteen minutes later, he saw the two great saints in the Profound Maiden Courtyard.

“I pay my greetings to the two Mistresses,” Lin Yun greeted. This was how he addressed the two after getting used to it.

The Serene Dust Great Saint wore a smile because she had been expressing her dote for Lin Yun, and she had accepted Lin Yun’s form of address to her. On the other hand, the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint still looked cold, like ice, as usual.

“This is your reward as the champion of the Sword Assembly. I’ve brought them back for you.” The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint took out two bottles containing the Great Solar Saint Pellet and Great Lunar Saint Pellet.

Lin Yun’s eyes lit up and quickly took possession of them. He said, “Thank you, Mistress!”

With that, his trip to the Hidden Sword Manor was complete. Not only did he receive a lot of comprehension, but the Divine Firefly Sword had reached complete mastery and he had reach the ninth transformation of the Nirvana Stage. The only pity he felt was the reward from the Sword Assembly, but the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint brought it back for him. Lin Yun couldn’t help expressing joy when he looked at the two bottles.

“The Heavenly Dipper Sword will still take some time. But it will be handed to you since the Abyssal Gale Great Saint has given his word,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said.

“That’s enough.” Lin Yun was already satisfied with his harvest. After all, pellets that could aid the cultivation of sword intent were rare even within the Heavenly Dao Sect, and he couldn’t get them since he wasn’t a holy son, not even with the help of the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint and Serene Dust Great Saint.

“One more thing.” The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint handed a box over and continued, “Inside this box contains the True Dragon Bloodfire Pellet, refined with the blood of a true dragon. Your senior sister obtained this treasure at the Eastern Sea and is giving it to you as a meeting gift, knowing that you have cultivated the Dragon Clan’s saint physique. You can treat it as eighth-grade true dragon saint liquid, with ten times the effect. After all, at least five thousand catty of true dragon’s blood is required to refine it, and the value is unimaginable. Even the Divine Dragon Empire doesn’t have many of them, and the value of unrefined divine dragon’s blood cannot even be compared to it. It can be considered as a Sovereign Saint Pellet.”

Lin Yun was baffled as he asked, “My senior sister? When did I meet my senior sister?”

He began to recall and wonder if it was the woman who was standing beside Feng Wuji. But she looked young, and he never imagined that she would be his senior sister.

“It’s okay. Your senior sister said you have a sweet mouth, and that she’s fond of you. She initially planned to use it herself, but she decided to give it to you as a meeting gift,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said as she handed the True Dragon Bloodfire Pellet over.

“This is the complete Sovereign Dragon Fist that I promised you. Thanks to you, we can borrow the Cauldron Sword,” the Serene Dust Great Saint smiled and passed a jade slip over.

“Thank you, Mistress. It’s my responsibility,” Lin Yun smiled.

“How can it be your?responsibility? This trip was dangerous, and just borrowing the sword was dangerous. You didn’t even know that even the White Bone Blade Saint appeared after you left, and I naturally had to show something.” After the Serene Dust Great Saint was done speaking, she casually turned to look at the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint.

“No need, no need.” Lin Yun wasn’t a fool, and he could tell that the Serene Dust Great Saint was trying to compete with the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint.

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint was straightforward as she said, “Ye Qingtian, you don’t have to be humble. The trip to the Sword Assembly has affected your opportunity to head to the God Burial Mountain Range. I will compensate you for that, but not now. After your Divine Firefly Sword’s second section reaches the miniscule stage, I will teach you the dao section. As for reaching the tenth transformation of the Nirvana Stage, ordinary treasures can’t help you. But if you want to reach the Quasi-Saint Realm, I can think of a way to ensure that you reach it before the Blue Dragon Record appears.”

“Thank you, Mistress. I have doubts regarding the tenth transformation of the Nirvana Stage,” Lin Yun said. He wanted to reach the tenth transformation of the Nirvana Stage; he could take this opportunity to get pointers from the two Great Saints.

He initially planned to enter the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda, relying on the resources inside and altered time within to reach the tenth transformation of the Nirvana Stage. But after he told the two mistresses about that, they shook their heads.

The Serene Dust Great Saint told him it was impossible to reach the tenth transformation of the Nirvana Stage by relying on extended time. If it was that easy, there would already be countless geniuses who’ve reached it. The tenth transformation of the Nirvana Stage required an unimaginable foundation, such as a treasure like the True Dragon Bloodfire Pellet, and there needed to be at least three of them. Not to mention the process was dangerous because the consequences were dire if he failed. Aside from that, he also needed a little fortune.

That’s right, the two mistresses agreed to Lin Yun reaching for the tenth transformation of the Nirvana Stage because of fortune.

“You’re the first on the King Ranking. Regardless of the King Ranking or Dragon Pulse Ranking, those with their names on it would have been more fortunate than others,” the Serene Dust Great Saint said.

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said, “Within the entire Eastern Desolation, no one can compete with you in terms of fortune.” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Lin Yun was also shocked to hear that. He naturally believed in fortune, but that was too ethereal. So he didn’t think the two mistresses would be so determined.

“Fortune does exist, but it’s not invincible. If you can’t grasp hold of it well, others might seize your fortune,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said.

“You must’ve used the Three-Lives Fruit before. So you shouldn’t use any time and space-related treasures before reaching the Quasi-Saint Realm,” the Serene Dust Great Saint said.

“Is there a reason for that?” Lin Yun asked.

The Serene Dust Great Saint nodded, “Time might’ve been altered, but your age remains. There’s a lifespan within the body, and it’ll impact your promotion to the Quasi-Saint Realm. Otherwise, wouldn’t everyone be invincible if they stayed in there and cultivated for a hundred years? Although time will slow down for you because of your two dragon saint physiques, time will still flow.”

Lin Yun nodded, expressing that he understood what the Serene Dust Great Saint said.

After answering Lin Yun’s questions, the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint left.

Lin Yun said with a grave expression, “Mistress, about Wang Muyan’s matters…”

He was here to discuss Wang Muyan because he was worried that she might be planning something.

“Bai Ziyuan has already sent someone to keep an eye on her, so you don’t have to be worried.”

“It’s hard for ordinary people to keep an eye on her,” Lin Yun said cautiously. Wang Muyan was too bewitching, and even a Quasi-Saint might not be able to resist her charm. She didn’t even need to execute her charming technique to bewitch someone.

After all, Wang Muyan was born bewitching, to begin with. So she would arouse the desire within anyone’s hearts if she got close to them. He was afraid that the one watching Wang Muyan might change sides.

“I know what you’re worried about, but you can be relieved. Since Bai Ziyuan has made a move, she’ll keep an eye on her,” the Serene Dust Great Saint smiled. She seemed to be confident in Bai Ziyuan. This was because Bai Ziyuan held great authority within the Bai Clan, aside from managing the Nether Orchid Courtyard. The Bai Clan was deeply rooted within the Heavenly Dao Sect and was stronger than the Wang Clan.

“We’re in times of trouble. Anyway, I have two things to talk to you about,” the Serene Dust Great Saint said with a grave expression. “Firstly, Tian Xuanzi has issued a challenge to the Divine Dao Sect, and he’ll pay the six holy lands a visit individually.”

Lin Yun widened his mouth, not expecting that Tian Xuanzi really meant what he said.

“Secondly, the Blue Dragon Record will descend within the Eastern Desolation on the fifteen of month eight.”

It’s finally here! Lin Yun calculated and knew there were only four months left.

“Mu Lingxue, the Divine Dragon Envoy, personally announced this news. She’ll personally host the grand event of the Blue Dragon Record.”

After returning from the Profound Maiden Courtyard, Lin Yun felt that he had too little time. Regardless of Tian Xuanzi wanting to rule the Eastern Desolation or the descent of the Blue Dragon Record, they greatly pressured him.

After looking at the Great Solar Saint Pellets, Great Lunar Saint Pellets, and the True Dragon Bloodfire Pellet, Lin Yun wasn’t hurrying to refine them. He wanted to bring the Divine Firefly Sword to the minuscule stage first. But the Sword Emperor’s understanding of the Divine Firefly Sword didn’t belong to him, and he needed to make it his own to truly reach complete mastery.

Time passed without him knowing, and Lil’ Purple returned sometime later on. She asked, “How is it? Were you slacking when I was not around?”

“My progress isn’t that bad. I nearly reached complete mastery with the Divine Firefly Sword, the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint brought my rewards back, the Serene Dust Great Saint gave me the complete Sovereign Dragon Fist, and my senior sister gave me a True Dragon Bloodfire Pellet.”

Lil’ Purple was dumbfounded when she heard what Lin Yun said. In the end, she couldn’t help speaking out in jealousy, “Your mistresses and senior sister are really generous to you. On the other hand, I have nothing to give you.”

It was already late at night, and the sky was rumbling with thunder as though rain would fall any moment.

Lin Yun smiled, “Did you discover anything with Wang Muyan?”

Lil’ Purple laid on the chair and said, “That demoness is too normal. There’s nothing unusual with her, and she practically spent her time within the Heavenly Yin Palace. Didn’t she say that she has a lot of men? I didn’t even see any. Don’t tell me that she has really taken a fancy to you? But she left the Heavenly Yin Palace today and seems to have left the sect. So I returned.”

“She left the sect?” Lin Yun’s gaze changed, and he said, “It’s normal for her to leave. But…”

It was normal for her to leave, but Lin Yun felt something wasn’t right somewhere.

“Hehe. I knew you’d say that. I have memorized her scent and can track her any time,” Lil’ Purple said. “She probably can’t keep herself down and went out to look for men. Let’s go and catch her!”

Lin Yun was speechless when he heard what Lil’ Purple said. But when he wanted to let this matter go, he suddenly thought of something and said, “Not good! Let’s go and catch up to her quickly!”

Lin Yun dashed out of his courtyard with Lil’ Purple, saying in disdain, “I knew you were a scumbag.”
