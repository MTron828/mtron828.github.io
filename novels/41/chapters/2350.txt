Chapter 2351 - Don’t Even Think About It

No one expected Lin Yun to take the initiative to attack, exceeding everyone’s surprise. Lin Yun first ran into Gu Jun while being basked in flames, looking like a deity.

“Primordial aura!” Gu Jun released the primordial aura and activated his Golden Jade Divine Physique without restraints. In just one exchange, Lin Yun sent him flying away with the Flower Burial Sword.

Before Gu Jun could react, a sword ray landed on his chest and sent him flying even further. The Golden Jade Divine Physique was broken with one exchange, and it couldn’t withstand Lin Yun’s Quasi-Bright Sun Sword Intent.

Gu Jun threw out a mouthful of blood, with his face becoming pale from the pain. But he was soon horrified to discover that the sword didn’t just break his Golden Jade Divine Physique, but it even broke his ribs and internal organs.

“This... How is this possible...? How did he cultivate...?” Gu Jun was shocked because he was also a swordsman, but Lin Yun was stronger than other swordsmen.

After sending Gu Jun flying, Lin Yun turned around and charged at the remaining six. He would leave afterimages and sword rays flying around, destroying all the incoming attacks.

“Suppress him! Don’t let him unleash the power of his Quasi-Bright Sun Sword Intent!” Liu Aohan was shocked, but he soon calmed down as the six brought out their divine physiques with primordial aura gushing out of their golden pills. Shortly after, the might of the heavenly dao empowered them, and their aura began to explode.

After becoming seventh-stage Saint Lords, they could extract the primordial aura from heavenly dao. Each tribulation was the test of heavenly dao. After making it through, the primordial aura would contain a hint of heavenly dao’s might.

But Lin Yun’s sword intent was too powerful and he released the Azure Dragon Sword Domain with a thought. The six couldn’t hold their ground anymore. In just ten-odd moves, the six were sent flying away. It was as though Lin Yun could predict their next move. He then landed on a stone pillar and saw Gu Jun, who was launching a sneak attack.

Gu Jun’s attack missed, so he raised his head and saw Lin Yun’s gaze, frightening him.

“Come here!” Lin Yun reached out, executing the Azure Dragon’s Grasp, and pulled Gu Jun over before grabbing the latter by his neck, raising him to the sky.

“What are you trying to do?” Gu Jun’s legs trembled upon seeing Lin Yun’s cold gaze, and he was facing an unprecedented horror.

“Have some fun with you.” Lin Yun jumped down the pillar and started swinging Gu Jun’s body around, slamking him into the ground. Even with the Golden Jade Divine Physique, Gu Jun couldn’t bear the torture, and each impact would cause his bones to crack.

“Let Gu Jun go!” The other six exclaimed as they charged over.

“Great!” Lin Yun laughed and threw Gu Jun over, which the six quickly dodged. Seeing that they didn’t want to catch Gu Jun, Lin Yun pulled him over like a ball. “I’ll take him since you guys don’t want him.”

This scene left everyone dumbfounded. An influential figure of a Divine Clan was being tortured in Lin Yun’s hands. But something even more terrifying was about to take place. Lin Yun controlled the Flower Burial Sword from afar, which stopped the six from approaching. Using sword intent in his right hand, he dragged Gu Jun over.

Suddenly, blood splashed out from Gu Jun’s body, and a dazzling sphere appeared in Lin Yun’s hand after Gu Jun was thrown away. It was radiating with saint energy.

“Saint origin!”

“That’s Gu Jun’s saint origin!”

“Holy shit, Lin Yun dug out Gu Jun’s saint origin?”

“This is too terrifying.”

“Gu Jun has been saying that he wanted to dig out Lin Yun’s saint origin and refine the Golden Dao Fruits inside, but his saint origin was dug out instead.”

“It looks like Lin Yun has been putting up with him earlier.”

“Is there a possibility that Lin Yun didn’t know the rules and only knew that you couldn’t kill on the Heavenly Barren Saint Mountain, but Gu Jun’s words reminded him?” The bloody scene caused an uproar, with everyone being shocked.

“Big Brother Jun...” The geniuses of the Gu Clan came over with shock and anger. The good news was that Gu Jun was alive, but the bad news was Gu Jun was crippled. He no longer had any saint dao on him since his saint origin was ripped out, and his cultivation was only at the Samsara Edict Realm.

But there was even more bad news. Gu Jun most likely wouldn’t be able to even retain his cultivation in the Samsara Edict Realm. Lin Yun smashed his bones, so he wouldn’t be able to regain his cultivation in the Samsara Edict Realm with such heavy injuries.

“Lin Yun, how dare you commit such blasphemy!” The Gu Clan suddenly became furious, but they were so frightened that they didn’t dare to say another word when Lin Yun recalled the Flower Burial Sword. Lin Yun dared to put his words into action even if his opponent was from the Divine Clan. They were still planning to charge forth, but they trembled in fear when they met Lin Yun’s gaze.

“Take... revenge for me...”Gu Jun said.

Gu Xing’s face was pale, with his lips trembling. He said, “Big Brother, we’ll put up with it for now. The prince isn’t around, and this is the Heavenly Barren Realm... We can’t afford to offend him.”

This made Lin Yun look at Gu Xing with contempt and turned to look at the six leaders from the various Divine Clans. They were noble since birth and influential figures even in the universe.

“Lin Yun, how dare a mortal blood like you rip out Gu Jun’s saint origin! Do you know what you’ve done?!” Liu Aohan roared with his scalp going numb. What happened earlier blew their confidence away because they never imagined it could happen. In their mindset, only they could bully Lin Yun and rip his saint origin, not vice versa. If Lin Yun resisted, they would become furious.

“I’ve said not to cross my bottom line. Otherwise, the blame will be on you, the Divine Clans,” Lin Yun said indifferently. “You guys will bear the consequences!”

“Cripple him!”

“We have to get rid of him, or the Divine Clans’ reputation will disappear!” They knew that if they continued to allow Lin Yun to trample over them, the consequences could be dire if they wanted to bully others in the future.

“Flower Burial, can you hear it?” Lin Yun gently looked at the sword in his hand. The Flower Burial Sword vibrated in response to Lin Yun. In the next second, Lin Yun’s temperament changed and was giving off a powerful aura that belonged to Flower Burial.

On the other hand, the faces of the six from the Divine Clans became cold, with a hint of viciousness flashing across Liu Aohan’s eyes. “Don’t care about the rules and kill him!”

Liu Aohan made the first move and performed the martial technique of his clan, an invincible fist technique. Relying on this fist technique, he never once suffered a defeat against those of the same generation. He threw out nine hundred and ninety-nine punches in a single breath, combined with his three Sovereign Daos, and reached a terrifying height.

The radiance released from this attack was dazzling. Bai Aohan roared with his blood boiling. He used a specific secret technique, giving off a terrifying ancient aura. As his hands began to move, it was like a ceremonial dance, making everyone feel a dangerous aura. The others also didn’t hesitate to use their most potent attacks.

But the world became quiet when Lin Yun swung his sword. The Dragon Sun and Moon Seal revolved as nine thousand ribbons flew out. This was a shocking scene that looked as though the entire sky was being supported, and Lin Yun’s sword aura became boundless.

When his Quasi-Bright Sun Sword Intent empowered the ribbons, it caused an uproar with Lin Yun’s sword intent pushed to the limit. He was like an immortal that made the Heavenly Barren Saint Mountain become tiny.

The faces of the six changed, and they were horrified because Lin Yun was only a hundred meters away, but they felt that he was thousands of miles away. No matter how hard they tried, they couldn’t get close to him.

As the ribbons rose, Lin Yun felt he didn’t exist between this heaven and earth. The six despaired to discover that their strongest attacks were futile before Lin Yun’s sword. In their eyes, Lin Yun hovered in the air, looking like he was supporting the entire sky. Not only could they not get close, but when the sword aura descended, their primordial aura and saint daos shattered.

“What sword technique is that?”

“Isn’t that too unfathomable?” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“I can only tell it’s a dragon clan’s martial technique.”

“His sword mastery has reached an unprecedented height. I would believe it if you told me that he’s the reincarnation of a Sword God.” Many swordsmen were present, but they couldn’t comprehend Lin Yun’s sword technique.

When Lin Yun was about to swing his sword, everyone felt despair and Liu Aohan became the first to kneel on the ground.

“Flower Burial, Liu Aohan admits defeat!” The six were on their knees without any thought of resisting and only felt despair.

“Flower Burial, let us go!”

“Everything can be negotiated if you don’t rip out our saint origins!” The six began to kowtow on the ground. This overturned everyone’s impression of the Divine Clans, and they never expected that the aloof Divine Clans would have this side to them. But in reality, they were born noble, but this also meant they had more to lose.

“What do you guys mean? Who doesn’t know that I have a good temper?” Lin Yun smiled.

This made the six feel relieved. But when they raised their heads, they began to tremble in fear.

“But I have promised you guys...” Lin Yun smiled, and he continued, “You guys can just become cripple for the rest of your lives!”

Let them go? Dream on!
