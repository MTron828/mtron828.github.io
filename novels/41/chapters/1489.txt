Chapter 1490 - Ten Thousand Years Flower! (1)

Three hours later, Lin Yun wandered throughout their region to look for all sorts of saint trees, waiting for everyone to leave before retrieving them. He relied on the Azure Dragon Saint Art to withstand the attacks of those saint trees in addition to the gravity of the Earth Sword Form, quickly obtaining ten-odd varieties of saint fruits.

He had at least ten fruits for each variety, which could be considered an enormous harvest. The difficulty of retrieving each variety was also different. As for those rare saint fruits like the Frost Lightning Saint Fruit, Lin Yun only obtained seven of them.

More accurately, those with ice or fire attributes greatly restrained his physique because they could penetrate through his defenses to inflict injuries on his internal organs. There was a form of saint fruit, the Heavenly Flame Saint Fruit. It nearly dissolved his dragon runes when he retrieved the seventh one.

In the end, Lin Yun could only helplessly stop. When he returned, An Liuyan was already irritable, and she complained when she saw his return, “Young Master Lin, you’re finally willing to come back?”

But Lin Yun merely smiled and gave her fruits of each variety. When An Liuyan saw those fruits, she was utterly dumbfounded, “Aquamoon Saint Fruit, Frostheart Saint Fruit, Emerald Aquatic Saint Fruit, Wind Lightning Saint Fruit… Heavenly Flame Saint Fruit!”

“They’re for you.” Lin Yun smiled since he was in a good mood.

His words made An Liuyan’s face blush, and the pace of her breathing also increased. Her chest was heaving up and down, and the scene was enough to make anyone’s blood boil. She was still in disbelief, looking at the saint fruits, and asked, “Are they really for me?”

“Why do you think I gave them to you, then?” Lin Yun asked.

“N-No man has treated me so well before…” An Liuyan sighed while stowing the fruits.

Lin Yun was surprised to hear that, and he asked, “I heard that a lot of people in the righteous and demonic paths are willing to befriend you. Didn’t that youth named Ye Qingli give you a Lightflow Saint Fruit earlier?”

When An Liuyan heard that, she started laughing and sarcastically replied, “That bastard owes me four million Divine Astral Pellets, and it’s been about six months. He naturally has to be on my good side if he doesn’t want to be exposed. But I never expected that he’d be shameless enough to snatch a saint fruit from a woman to try and please me.”

“Let’s refine the saint fruits first.”

“Alright.” There were many experts in the Dragon Remnant Astral Realm, and they were all heading to the Dragon Burial Valley.

Lin Yun and An Liuyan quickly found a secluded valley to start refining the saint fruits. After Lin Yun refined six saint fruits, he opened his eyes and took a long breath.

He was enveloped in a holy light, but it didn’t take long for the holy light to enter his body, allowing his acupoints to shine brightly.

“I finally reached the five-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm with my astral energy ocean reaching 20,000 feet. Also, the number of my saint aura strands has reached 2,000!” Lin Yun muttered, and he couldn’t conceal the joy on his face.

This was only the first day since they entered the Dragon Remnant Astral Realm, and he had already made a breakthrough to the five-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm. Even the golden astral energy in his violet palace became clearer and purer.

This made Lin Yun feel unreal. What Can Jiu and the others said wasn’t wrong. An undiscovered astral realm was filled with opportunities. Even if he couldn’t find a Divine Dragon Bone here, this was still a huge opportunity for him to quickly get stronger.

But then again, not every astral realm was filled with benefits. Many undiscovered astral realms did not have any resources and were filled with nothing but dangers. So it wasn’t easy to find an astral realm like the Dragon Remnant Astral Realm that was filled with opportunities, it heavily depended on luck.

Not too far away, An Liuyan was still refining the saint fruits. Her speed wasn’t as fast as Lin Yun, but the holy light she was emitting was a lot brighter than his, giving her an ethereal temperament.

Seeing this, Lin Yun took out all the saint fruits in his interspatial bracelet to calculate his harvest. He had obtained a total of thirteen different varieties of saint fruits, with roughly about a hundred of them altogether. There were still seven different varieties of saint fruits that he had yet to refine.

For saint fruits, most were only effective if he took the first time. So he planned to save them up for Ye Ziling and others after returning to the Sword Sect. Amongst all the saint fruits he obtained, Ye Ziling should like the Frost Lightning Saint Fruit a lot.

He was also filled with anticipation for the Wind Lightning Saint Fruit and Heavenly Flame Saint Fruit that he had yet to refine. The value of these saint fruits was tremendous and they were rare in the outside world.

But Lin Yun was worried that he couldn’t smoothly bring them out with him, which meant he needed to be prepared in advance.

Another hour later, An Liuyan’s aura changed. She had successfully made a breakthrough into the seven-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm. After she made a breakthrough, the charm she was excluding was much more significant than before.

She looked like a flawless lotus but also gave off an alluring temperament. Paired together with her voluptuous figure, it only made her look even more charming. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Most importantly, An Liuyan knew her strengths, and she didn’t bother concealing her charm. Xin Yan also had a voluptuous figure, but she wouldn’t wear it in such an exposed manner like An Liuyan. Most importantly, Lin Yun could feel his heart surging within his body when he saw the massive patch of skin that An Liuyan had revealed on her chest.

“What are you looking at?” An Liuyan opened her eyes and smiled just when Lin Yun was about to shift his gaze away.

Hearing what An Liuyan said made Lin Yun briefly stunned, and he nonchalantly said, “Looking at where I should look.”

“Haha.” An Liuyan laughed because she was surprised by Lin Yun’s honesty.

But then, Lin Yun’s face changed as he exclaimed, “Someone’s here!”

After Lin Yun was done speaking, three figures appeared in the air. The three were attracted by the holy light being emitted from the valley, thinking that a treasure was born there.

The young man in the middle of the three had a slim figure and fair skin that even a woman would be envious of. Moreover, he was emitting the aura of a seven-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm expert.

When his gaze fell onto An Liuyan, his eyes lit up, and he smiled, “So it’s Envoy An refining saint fruits here. I’m Lan Siyu of the Netherworld Hall. I have long heard of your beauty, and it’s not an exaggeration!”

He had pride written all over his face when he mentioned the Netherworld Palace. After all, the Netherworld Hall and Blood Moon Sect’s foundations were stronger than the Seven Absolute Palace, Blood Rain Pavilion, Demonfiend Sect, Hundred Ghost Gate, and Heavenly Astral Pavilion.

The Netherworld Hall was the one who took the lead to inflict pressure on the Heavenly Astral Pavilion, and they were also the ones who first launched an attack on the Heavenly Astral Pavilion. So anyone could see how arrogant they were.
