Lin Yun wore a solemn expression as he stowed the Divine Golden Crow Iron. He was surprised because he didn’t think that the sect master would give him something so precious. This treasure wasn’t inferior to the Golden Dragon Bone given to Qin Cang by Tian Xuanzi. But bod have their own pros and cons, so no one could be sure which one was more precious.

The Golden Dragon Bone could temper the physique that pairs with Qin Cang’s dragon clan martial technique. So it wasn’t that useful to Lin Yun since he preferred the Azure Dragon King Bone. Aside from the Azure Dragon King’s true bone, other dragon bones with the authority over thunderstorms would also work.

The reason why Lin Yun used the Golden Dragon Bone to brew soup was because he had no better way of dealing with it. The Divine Golden Crow Iron would be useless to Qin Cang. The best it could do for him was make his physique stronger. But it was entirely different for Lin Yun.

The Divine Golden Crow Iron could allow his Golden Crow Wings to transform, and this meant that he could start planning on collecting the Dragon Pulse Realm section of the Divine Sunchasing Art. Even if he couldn’t find it, his Golden Crow Wings could transform and reach an unprecedented height.

As he thought about it, Lin Yun smiled. It had been a long time since he smiled so heartedly. Ever since he left the Sword Firmament Pavilion, he had been drifting around without a place to call home. But he finally found a sense of home in the Sword Sect. He felt warmth from the Radiant Sword Saint and Mu Xuankong and knew this palace would be his home from today onwards.

With a smile, Lin Yun turned to Chen Ling after storing the Divine Golden Crow Iron, “Junior Brother, can you bring me to the Martial Arts Hall? I don’t know the way there.”

“My pleasure.” Chen Ling smiled before they left the Cloud Soaring Peak. While chatting along the way, Lin Yun learned that over the past three days he was in seclusion, his status as a heaven direct disciple had caused a more significant uproar than he had imagined.

The geniuses on the Earth Ranking were all dumbfounded, and all of them were unconvinced. There were rumors that those in the top ten of the Earth Ranking caused a huge fuss when they returned to their respective peaks.

“Can you guess how the peak masters replied to them?” Chen Ling smiled.

Lin Yun could understand what they were feeling. He wouldn’t be happy about it if he was in their position. But he really couldn’t guess how the peak masters would reply to them.

“The peak masters said that if they can stay in the Saint Pool for a month like you, they could also immediately become heaven direct disciples,” Chen Ling laughed.

When Lin Yun heard that, he was stunned for a moment before he smiled. The only reason he could stay at the bottom of the Saint Pool was thanks to the cauldron, which had nothing to do with his strength. It was no different from cheating, and those in the top ten would definitely be able to guess that as well. But there was nothing they could say about the peak masters’ words.

Half an hour later, Chen Ling landed on a floating island near the Divine Firmament Peak with Lin Yun. The center of this floating peak had an ancient towering palace with a long flight of stairs. Along the way, there were many Divine Firmament Peak disciples, and they would all bow or cup their hands when they saw Lin Yun.

After all, Lin Yun was a huge celebrity in the Divine Firmament Peak now. The other peaks were unhappy with Lin Yun, but the disciples of the Divine Firmament Peak were excited. After all, they could finally raise their heads as disciples of the Divine Firmament Peak.

“You can go ahead. I’ll be waiting for you here. You still have another place to go to after this.” Chen Ling smiled as he came to a stop before the palace.

Nodding his head, Lin Yun walked forth. Several ancient trees were planted before the Martial Arts Hall, with the courtyard covered in fallen leaves.

“You’re here!” Mu Chuan opened his eyes and looked at Lin Yun.

“Senior Brother!” Lin Yun was a little surprised because he didn’t expect Mu Chuan to be here, waiting for him.

“You should address me as Third Senior Brother. It’s more accurate that way.” Mu Chuan smiled before he got up on his feet, “Come with me!”

So who is the first and second senior brother? Mu Chuan was the peak master in charge of the Divine Firmament Peak on behalf of their master. This made him wonder if they were in the Divine Firmament Peak. Then again, they wouldn’t have allowed the Divine Firmament Peak to decline so much if they were around since there were no disciples from the Divine Firmament Peak on the Heaven and Earth Rankings.

When Lin Yun raised his head, he saw that Mu Chuan was already far away, so he quickly caught up with him.

“Junior Brother, as a heaven direct disciple, you can pick a ghost spirit martial technique without needing any contributions or tests.” Mu Chuan explained as he led the way.” “But I don’t recommend picking the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra. You can choose the Primordial Netherserpent Sword like Chen Ling. His comprehension is weaker than your own, which is why he can’t grasp it to greater mastery.”

“Uhh…” Lin Yun was briefly silent before he asked, “Why? The four other peaks have their own cultivation techniques. If I don’t practice it, won’t it be the same as fighting with one hand?”

“Oh?” Mu Chuan amusingly exclaimed before he continued, “Looks like Chen Ling said something to you. How did he tell you about it?”

“The Scarlet Firmament Sword Sutra, Azure Firmament Sword Sutra, Indigo Firmament Sword Sutra, and Golden Firmament Sword Sutra are famous ghost spirit sword sutras in the Ancient Barren Domain…” Lin Yun said without any hesitation.

But just when he was about to speak about the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra, Mu Chuan suddenly grabbed onto a falling leaf before waving his hand. The leaf was like a feeble sword ray that circled the courtyard. Everything withered in the path of that leaf. When the leaf returned to Mu Chuan’s hand, the latter said, “Absolute annihilation of the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra!”

When the wind blew, everything was reduced to ashes and blew away, leaving behind a bald tree. This made Lin Yun’s jaw drop because this was too unbelievable. He couldn’t sense any aura coming from Mu Chuan. It was as though he was just casually waving his hand.

“Many powers have the characteristic of absolute annihilation, but the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra is a lot purer and can make everything wither. The profundity behind the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra is death!” Mu Chuan said. “But do you know how long it took me to enter the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra’s threshold and barely grasp this power?

“At the age of fifty!” Mu Chuan answered before Lin Yun could reply.

Lin Yun fell into silence when he heard that, and he now knew why so many people gave up on the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra. It wasn’t something that just anyone could cultivate. Since Mu Chuan could be taken in as a disciple by their master, Mu Chuan’s comprehension wasn’t weak. But he only grasped it at the age of fifty? This practically meant that Lin Yun would need to spend nearly his entire life comprehending it.

“What about Jian Jingtian…?” Lin Yun asked.

“Fifth Junior Brother had his own opportunity. He didn’t cultivate the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra. I’m the only one who has practiced the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra amongst our fellow martial brothers. Even our master didn’t practice it.” Mu Chuan gave an answer that Lin Yun had entirely never expected. “Aside from the Primordial Netherserpent Sword, there are still many powerful ghost spirit martial techniques that you can try…”

But Lin Yun fell into silence for a long time before he took a deep breath and raised his head, “Senior Brother, I’ve decided to pick the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra!”

It wasn’t because he was stubborn but had his own plans. The Divine Firmament Sword Sutra was powerful, and the characteristics were somewhat similar to the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon. So cultivating it would benefit him in controlling the cauldron. Even if he couldn’t control it, it shouldn’t be a problem for him to suppress it.

Furthermore, he heard from Lil’ Purple that the majority of the reason why the Iris Sword Saint could slay deities was because of his Nirvana Dao, and death was part of it.

“I knew that you wouldn’t change your mind.” Mu Chuan smiled bitterly. “Then continue forth, and don’t pick anything else. There’s a stone gate at the far end. You just have to push it open.”

Nodding his head, Lin Yun followed Mu Chuan’s instructions and entered the Martial Arts Hall. The Martial Arts Hall was lit with lamps and jade slips that shone like stars within the palace. Many people were picking martial techniques within the palace, giving Lin Yun a nod when they saw him.

Lin Yun didn’t look at any of the jade slips and continued down the passage. The surroundings were gradually becoming dark before he reached the far end. Lin Yun came to a stop and saw a stone gate before him. Above the stone gate, there were two words engraved on it, Nether Palace.

“This should be the place.” Lin Yun placed his hand on the stone gate before he pushed it open. His action made all the surrounding disciples stop what they were doing as they looked at Lin Yun slowly going beyond the stone gate.

Once everyone eventually came to their senses, they exclaimed, “The Nether Palace!”

“Lin Yun actually entered the Nether Palace! Is he planning to pick the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra?”

“It’s too difficult, not to mention that he’s only at the one-star heavenly Elysium Core Realm. This is too risky.”

“It’s hard to grasp the first three stages before reaching the Dragon Pulse Realm.” An uproar burst out in the Martial Arts Hall.

Outside the Martial Arts Hall, Chen Ling, who was waiting with his eyes closed, suddenly opened them. He raised his head to look at the palace and saw a certain window lighting up. When a black light shone out from the window, it instantly made the surroundings eerie. But that was only for a short moment before the black light quickly shrank back.

“Absolute annihilation of the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra…” Chen Ling muttered to himself. He was surprised by Lin Yun’s choice, and he could also understand his choice at the same time. But most people regretted picking the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra, and they would generally give up after reaching the Dragon Pulse Realm.

He was also once tempted by it but ultimately gave up. If he took the wrong step, he would lack behind others. He didn’t know if it would be a bad move for Lin Yun, but he knew that the Sword Sect wouldn’t be calm with his arrival.
