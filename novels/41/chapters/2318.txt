Chapter 2319 - Heavenly King Sword

Lin Yun and Ji Zixi roughly calculated that there were over three hundred white fortunes. The fortune from the alpha wolf was purple, clearly of a higher grade than the other fortunes. It also contained Wind and Thunder attributes, which perfectly matched Lin Yun.

For the next few days, they would spend the time refining fortunes while consuming roasted meat at night to absorb the fortunes even further.

Ten days passed in the blink of an eye, with Lin Yun’s cultivation reaching the pinnacle of the fourth-stage Saint Lord. The number of Wind and Thunder Daos also reached three thousand. Just ten days of leisurely eating was equivalent to a hundred years of cultivation in the Kunlun Realm, and this was a shocking harvest.

When another five days passed, Lin Yun had successfully absorbed the alpha wolf’s fortune, and the number of Wind and Thunder Daos reached a staggering amount of five thousand. After consuming all the wolf meat, Lin Yun realized he could no longer progress in his saint dao. He instantly knew that he had reached the limit of hunting demonic beasts.

“Wu Yuhua is right; it’s like a buffet,” Lin Yun said with a wry smile.

If Wu Yuhua heard what Lin Yun said, he would be speechless. After all, it was unfathomable for Lin Yun to slaughter the entire wolf pack in a day.

When a commotion disrupted his trail of thoughts, he turned to see Ji Zixi emitting a golden radiance. Her unrivaled beauty and temperament made her seem otherworldly, without a trace of worldly desires.

“This is the Heavenly Phoenix Maiden?” Lin Yun muttered to himself. He noticed that Ji Zixi made more progress than him in this period. Even if he had absorbed the purple fortune, it felt like he couldn’t keep up with her since her bloodline was suited for the Heavenly Barren Realm. As she breathed, it felt as though she had achieved a resonation with heaven and earth, accompanied by a phoenix cry.

“This is the Heavenly Phoenix Maiden’s bloodline? She’s already so powerful without summoning her Divine Phoenix Wings…” Lin Yun muttered and looked amazed.

When Ji Zixi opened her eyes, she noticed Lin Yun’s attention on her, and she asked, “Big Brother Lin, what are you looking at?”

“Honestly speaking, how far have you progressed in your saint dao?” Lin Yun asked after he snapped back to reality.

“That’s a secret. Big Brother Lin is here to protect me, so I can just stand behind you,” Ji Zixi said with a playful look.

Lin Yun smiled and didn’t press the matter any further.

“It’s time for us to join up with Wu Yuhua,” Ji Zixi said.

“Yeah, but you should disguise yourself in case your looks cause trouble,” Lin Yun said seriously. Going around with Ji Zixi in this state would cause a commotion and unnecessary trouble.

Ji Zixi blushed, and nodded, “Okay.”

Four hours later, Lin Yun and Ji Zixi arrived at the promised location and waited for Wu Yuhua, who arrived late. Wu Yuhua was carrying a demonic beast on his back, and he greeted, “It took a lot of effort to capture this bear. I’m afraid that I will have to trouble Brother Lin.”

“It’s fine,” Lin Yun replied, removing the fur and roasting it. While Lin Yun was busy, Wu Yuhua asked Ji Zixi, “Lady Zixi, how’s your harvest? Did everything go smoothly? The wolf pack is tough to deal with, especially the alpha wolf, a sixth-stage Saint Lord who could make a breakthrough at any moment.”

Ji Zixi, who wore a mask and a hood to conceal her appearance, smiled. She glanced at Lin Yun, not knowing how to respond.

“I got it.” Wu Yuhua was under the impression that they ran into trouble and didn’t want to press further.

But this made Ji Zixi smile bitterly because Wu Yuhua probably wouldn’t believe it if she told him Lin Yun slayed the alpha wolf with one sword.

It didn’t take long before an aroma spread and Lin Yun and Wu Yuhua indulged in the fruit. As Wu Yuhua bit into the meat, he sighed, “Well, the good times are over now. It’s time for battles to take place.”

Lin Yun asked, “What other forces are there apart from the Azure Cloud Realm’s Heavenly Sword Pavilion?”

“Apart from the Heavenly Sword Pavilion, there’s the Suspension Palace, Blood Bone Sect, and Golden Jade Pavilion. Aside from them, there are some other demonic cultivators to watch out for. The Azure Cloud Realm is primarily a place of the righteous and dark paths, with the Heavenly Sword Pavilion barely holding onto the balance,” Wu Yuhua chuckled.

After Lin Yun had his fill, he wiped his mouth. He asked, “Since the Heavenly Sword Pavilion can remain strong despite being surrounded by various factions, the Heavenly Sword Pavilion must have some remarkable qualities.”Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“That’s right,” Wu Yuhua said with a smile. “The Azure Cloud Sect’s Heavenly Sword Pavilion is only a small branch. The true Heavenly Sword Pavilion operates across numerous realms, and they’re renowned for three sword techniques that were said to be capable of suppressing the universe.”

“Oh?” Lin Yun looked intrigued.

“They’re the Heavenly King Sword, Heavenly Monarch Sword, and Heavenly Divine Sword,” Wu Yuhua said pridefully. “The Heavenly Divine Sword is the most frightening one since it can shatter space and reverse stars, incorporating various Buddhist techniques, making it a marvel of nirvana.”

Lin Yun’s eyes lit up, and asked, “Brother Wu, do you know this sword technique?”

Wu Yuhua awkwardly smiled, “No one has managed to practice it in the Azure Cloud Realm. Only the divine son from the headquarters or those with high contributions can learn about it. The chiefs from the other realms can only practice the Heavenly Monarch Sword, while I practice the Heavenly King Sword. I can perform it if Brother Lin is interested.”

“Sure,” Lin Yun replied.

Wu Yuhua conjured a Glory Saint Sword in his hand. When he held onto it, a dragon’s roar echoed as the sword began to tremble, with the dragon's aura gradually solidifying. It didn’t take long before a vivid dragon appeared. When the dragon and sword merged, Wu Yuhua released a sword ray that looked like a king overlooking his kingdom.

“The first sword—Ninth Heavenly Dragon Roar!” A flashing lightning erupted from heaven, followed by a majestic dragon’s roar, making Lin Yun’s blood boil just by listening to it.

Lin Yun’s facial expression became grave since this was at least a high-grade dragon spirit martial technique. If it was placed in the Kunlun Realm, a Saint Lord of the same cultivation would be heavily injured if they took this attack head-on.

“The second sword—Dragon Radiance Of Life!”

“The third sword—Dragon Dominance Of The Eight Lands!”

“The fourth sword—Dragon Destruction Of The Sky!”

“The fifth sword—Dragon Roaming Of The Four Seas!”

“The sixth sword—Dragon Devouring Of The Sun!”

“The seventh sword—Picking Stars and Grasping Moon!”

“The eighth sword—Myriad Soaring Dragons!”

“The ninth sword—Absolute Dominance!”

It was a simple demonstration, so Wu Yuhua held back. Even if he held back, the power of this sword technique remained terrifying. After observing it, Lin Yun’s face calmed down. This sword technique might be powerful, but it hadn’t come in contact with the surface of dao.

This sword technique was much stronger than the Divine Firefly Sword, but this sword technique couldn’t compete in terms of the upper limit. The Heavenly King Sword’s initial mastery could compete with the Divine Firefly Sword in greater mastery. But upon reaching complete mastery, the Heavenly King Sword would be much stronger. If the Divine Firefly Sword reached the manifestation stage, there was no way the Heavenly King Sword could rival it.

“How is it?” Wu Yuhua asked.

Ji Zixi also looked at Lin Yun with curiosity because she wanted to know how Lin Yun would evaluate this sword technique.

“Heavenly king refers to true dragons. Brother Wu, you have reached greater mastery in this sword technique, and you can manifest the divine dragon if you reach complete mastery and cultivate the genuine king aura. At that time, your sword can connect to heaven, and the power of this sword technique will take another step forth,” Lin Yun said.

Wu Yuhua’s eyes lit up, and he smiled, "To see all that from just one demonstration, I haven't guessed wrong; you are truly a prodigy in the path of the sword."

Lin Yun smiled, “But even the heavenly might has its shortcomings. This sword technique ultimately borrows the might of heaven to manifest a dragon, whether it is a true dragon or a divine dragon. The power is excellent, but it’s not a proper path. If it were me, I wouldn’t focus on it any further after reaching greater mastery and would carry on my pursuit of the sword. Why would one fear the heavens?”

Wu Yuhua was stumped and didn’t quite understand what Lin Yun said.

“Well, that’s easier said than done. Most people are just borrowing the might of heaven, allowing them to roam the heaven, but that’s not the end, as you can go even further. Furthermore, this sword technique is sufficient till the Emperor Realm. There’s still the manifestation and deification stages after complete mastery,” Wu Yuhua said after coming to his senses. “Moreover, the Heavenly King Sword is a technique that serves as a transition.”

“It’s just my perspective, so you don’t have to take it to heart,” Lin Yun smiled.

Wu Yuhua smiled, waving his hand, “What you said does make sense. But not everyone has that ambition, and it’s better to roam around heaven than to chase an unrealistic objective.”

“I understand,” Lin Yun nodded. “If Brother Wu doesn’t mind, I have a technique to teach you that can help you reach complete mastery. But you can’t tell anyone about it.”

“That would be wonderful!” Wu Yuhua expressed his gratitude.

Ji Zixi, watching silently, gradually realized the situation. She looked at Lin Yun with an admiring gaze.

“We can continue our talk as we travel. I’ll take you to meet the other disciples and chief of the Heavenly Sword Pavilion,” Wu Yuhua said excitedly.

In the evening, Wu Yuhua brought Lin Yun to a camp. The camp was located in an ancient city where various forces of the Azure Cloud Realm were gathered, making the camp bustling with activity. Many tents were nearby, and most belonged to the Heavenly Sword Pavilion. This tent before them should be the main base of the Heavenly Sword Pavilion.

“Junior Brother Wu,” a man and a woman came out from the camp.

Wu Yuhua greeted them. Lin Yun already knew their names from his conversation with Wu Yuhua. The man was Chang Jun, while the woman was Xi Ruo. Both had extraordinary appearances and were not ordinary disciples.

“Who are they?” Chang Jun asked, looking at Lin Yun and Ji Zixi.

“They’re friends I met along the way and brought them over before the chaos took place,” Wu Yuhua said.

“Where are they from?” Chang Jun frowned. Lin Yun and Ji Zixi looked primitive in their eyes.

“The Kunlun Realm, the realm created by the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity,” Wu Yuhua smiled.

“The Kunlun Realm? It’s just a primitive land, and their glory is already in the past. What can they even do to help us? Speaking blatantly, they’re just here to take advantage of us,” the woman named Xi Ruo said scornfully.

Lin Yun and Ji Zixi exchanged a gaze with a hint of helplessness. It appeared that they were being looked down upon since they were from the Kunlun Realm.

Wu Yuhua unhappily said, “Junior Sister, aren’t you a little too harsh? Brother Lin isn’t ordinary; he even guided me in my sword technique along the way.”

“Him?” Xi Ruo scoffed. “A barbarian from the Kunlun Realm wants to guide the disciples of my Heavenly Sword Pavilion in the sword? Just the Heavenly King Sword is enough to level the entire Kunlun Realm in my eyes.”

“What a big tone. My Kunlun Realm’s Heavenly Path might be severed, but we’re not a place you can look down upon!” Ji Zixi couldn’t hold herself back before Lin Yun could speak, looking coldly at the woman named Xi Ruo. This woman was enchanting and charming, but her words were sarcastic.

“Senior Brother, she said that I spoke too harshly!” Xi Ruo turned to the man beside her.

“Friend, control your woman well. If she dares to speak another word, I’ll treat it as a form of disrespect to the Heavenly Sword Pavilion.” The youth named Chang Jun threatened as he took a step forward.

“And what if I don’t?” Lin Yun said with a smile.

Wu Yuhua looked unhappy and frowned, “Senior Brother Chang Jun, I already said that they were my friends. So show some respect.”

“What’s the problem?” A tent’s curtain opened and an extraordinary woman walked out, followed by several disciples from the Heavenly Sword Pavilion.

When they appeared, the faces of Wu Yuhua, Chang Jun, and Xi Ruo changed and they ceased their hostility.

Lin Yun couldn’t help taking a few more glances at this woman. Her clothes fluttered with her long hair dancing lightly. Her eyes contained the radiance of the sun and moon while giving off a regal aura. She was none other than the chief disciple of the Heavenly Sword Pavilion, Lin Jiangxian.

“Chief,” Wu Yuhua, Chang Jun, and Xi Ruo respectfully greeted her.

Wu Yuhua explained the situation in detail, and Lin Jiangxian turned to look at Lin Yun before cupping her fists together, “I am sorry for the disrespect of my sect’s disciples, and please accept my apology. May I ask your names?”

“Kunlun Realm’s Lin Yun.”

“Kunlun Realm’s Ji Zixi.” Lin Yun and Ji Zixi introduced themselves, seeing that Lin Jiangxian was rather polite.

“In the past, the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity had helped the Heavenly Sword Pavilion. Before the Heavenly Path was severed, there were connections between the Dragon’s Gate and the Heavenly Sword Pavilion. So as long as you guys aren’t demonic cultivators, we don’t want to be hostile to you guys,” Lin Jiangxian said calmly. She turned to Chang Jun and Xi Ruo and coldly said, “Apologize to them.”

Chang Jun and Xi Ruo were unwilling but could only force themselves to cup their fists together under Lin Jiangxian’s cold gaze.

The authority that Lin Jiangxian displayed was impressive, which made Lin Yun look at her with a hint of admiration.
