Chapter 1745 – Fight

Qin Hao’s words instantly caused an uproar in the surroundings. After all, Qin Hao was at the ninth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, and his cultivation was higher than Lin Yun’s, not to mention that he was a holy land genius. Based on his strength, he could face a Quasi-King head-on if he wanted to. So wasn’t he bullying Lin Yun to suggest a battle with martial dao? This only made Qin Hao seem like a sore loser.

When the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion’s pavilion master heard what he said, he furrowed his brows and asked, “Are you sure about that?”

“One move. Otherwise, I’m unwilling to accept this outcome!” Qin Hao gritted his teeth.

“Lin Yun was at fault for making a move against you earlier, but there was a reason behind that. I believe you know the reason well. The Profound Fairy had fought several battles, so you must receive her acknowledgment if you want to challenge her. But you didn’t, and you forcibly started the battle.” The pavilion master said. “Secondly, Lin Xiao and Yue Weiwei are lovers, and it’s understandable for him to want to stop you and protect her. Isn’t that the same case when forcibly you challenged Yue Weiwei without her agreement?”

Qin Hao’s face changed when he heard that. There was nothing he could say to refute what the pavilion master said.

“Last but not least, a loss is a loss. You can do nothing, even if you are unwilling to accept the outcome. If you’re unhappy, you can leave right now, and I won’t stop you.” The pavilion master was calm, shocking everyone with fear rising in their hearts.

At the same time, everyone turned to look at the pavilion master with shock on their faces because his words were a ruthless slap to Qin Hao’s face. The pavilion master was pretty blatant with his words. If Qin Hao was unhappy, he could scram.

Thus, this naturally caused a fluctuation in everyone’s hearts, making them wonder if Lin Yun had any background. After all, the pavilion master didn’t give Qin Hao any face for Lin Yun. But Qin Hao was a holy land genius. Did this mean Lin Yun’s background was even more significant than a holy land?

Qin Hao’s face was ugly because the pavilion master made himself clear. But he couldn’t accept such a grievous defeat and wasn’t willing to accept the result. Raising his head, his pupils blazed with flames of reluctance, and he said, “Only one move! Just one move without using weapons and constellations! Please fulfill my wish, Pavilion Master!”

His words made the pavilion master furrow his brows, and everyone could sense that the pavilion master was furious. After all, what Qin Hao did was different from questioning a Saint.

“One move is too little. Let’s go with three.” Lin Yun suddenly spoke right at that moment. This startled everyone, and they had no idea where Lin Yun got his confidence from for him to fight with a holy land genius in martial dao.

“Lin Xiao, are you sure about that?” The pavilion master asked.

“Since he’s unconvinced, I’ll just have to convince him. I have violated the rules by making a sudden move against him. Since that’s the case, I’ll give him three moves, then.” Lin Yun replied.

“That’s a promise, then!” Qin Hao laughed, not giving Lin Yun and the pavilion master a chance to change their minds. He stepped forward and appeared before Lin Yun, and his dragon pulses simultaneously appeared. Each of his dragon pulses reached a terrifying length of three hundred feet. He threw his punch towards Lin Yun without any hesitation.

Under his punch, the entire Nirvana Stage began to tremble. This surprised Lin Yun. Qin Hao probably practiced a high-grade ghost spirit martial technique with a strong foundation. But facing Qin Hao’s attack, Lin Yun didn’t take a step back, nor did he intend to block it.

“Is this fellow insane?” Everyone was shocked by this scene, with their faces changing. If Lin Yun took this punch head-on, he would be heavily injured, even if he was lucky, and he wouldn’t be able to participate in the third round any longer.

Looking at this scene, even the Divine Dao Pavilion’s Zhang Ying, Myriad Lightning Sect’s Chen Jun, and Ming Cult’s Li Yuxi were surprised.

When Qin Hao’s punch fell onto Lin Yun’s chest, the massive dragon origin behind his punch penetrated Lin Yun’s heart through his chest. When the dragon origin entered Lin Yun’s heart, it wanted to ignite it.

But something surprising happened. Lin Yun didn’t step back, and his chest shone brightly. A hundred thousand dragon runes had gathered in one spot to resist this punch. Under his punch, the dragon runes began to shatter, but the Blue Dragon Bone soon produced more dragon runes to replenish the destroyed ones. Thus, Qin Hao’s punch wasn’t able to harm Lin Yun.

Facing this dangerous situation, Lin Yun circulated the Blue Dragon Skybreaking Art and Azure Dragon Saint Art to withstand Qin Hao’s attack.

This made Qin Hao’s face slightly change, and he coldly said, “Not bad. Take another punch from me, then!”

This time, when the nine dragon pulses appeared, flames were blazing in the depths of his pupils. Taking three steps back, he threw out a punch, using the high-grade ghost spirit martial technique, the Heavenly Skyshattering Flaming Fist!

As flames blazed on his fist, a sea of fire appeared behind him, and his punch incinerated half the sky. He even used his martial intent this time, so he was serious this time.

But facing his attack, Lin Yun executed the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra when Qin Hao’s punch fell onto him. As the ancient Netherflower bloomed above his dragon origin ocean, the sixty-four petals filled his body with nether energy.

After using his martial technique and martial intent, Qin Hao’s punch instantly shattered the hundred thousand dragon runes. The terrifying flames were like roaring demons rampaging within Lin Yun’s body. Lin Yun’s heart was the first to take a blow.

This made Qin Hao rejoice, and he already had a solution. It was just as he had expected. At least fifty percent of power was preserved in his attack after he destroyed the dragon runes, and it was enough to injure Lin Yun, even if he had a strong physique.

But something weird happened. He didn’t see Lin Yun throwing out blood. On the contrary, his body was like a mountain, and the nether energy was slowly eroding the flames that were sent into his body. Ultimately, Qin Hao’s punch failed to injure Lin Yun once again.

“You have one move left.” Lin Yun said indifferently.

This made Qin Hao squint his pupils, and he couldn’t comprehend what was happening. He couldn’t believe that Lin Yun was fine after taking his attack.

“Heavenly Skyshattering Flaming Fist—Breaking Divine Dragon!” Qin Hao roared. He took a step, appearing a hundred meters away. When he dashed forth again, the sea of flames beneath him released a dragon’s roar, and the boundless flames manifested into a crimson dragon. It was the Red Dragon of the seven divine dragons.

The red dragon looked vivid, and each scale was flickering with flames. As Qin Hao stood on the dragon’s head, he appeared to be one with the dragon. When everyone saw this scene, they couldn’t help exclaiming.

They had witnessed the strength of a holy land’s genius now. The Heavenly Skyshattering Flaming Fist was fused with the essence of the Dragon Clan’s martial techniques, and it wasn’t something ordinary people could grasp.

Lin Yun took a deep breath when he saw this scene. Without using his sword intent and the Flower Burial Sword, he would face tremendous pressure facing a ninth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm genius. After all, he was in disguise and had many means he couldn’t use, which significantly restricted him.

But he was determined to beat Qin Hao today because no one could bully Yue Weiwei. Taking a deep breath, his pupils became crimson, and his presence was replaced with a destructive aura. When the terrifying aura was being emitted from him, Lin Yun inwardly roared while dragging out the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron from the bottom of his dragon origin ocean through the Netherflower.

When Qin Hao’s attack landed on his chest again, torrential flames enveloped them both. When the sea of fire gradually dissipated a brief moment later, everyone was surprised when they raised their heads to see Lin Yun still standing on the Nirvana Stage. This surprised everyone, and they looked at Lin Yun on the stage with disbelief.

“H-H-How is this possible…?” Qin Hao was shocked as he looked at Lin Yun.

“Your three moves are done, and it’s my turn now.” Lin Yun coldly looked at Qin Hao.

Qin Hao squinted his eyes when he heard that. He spread his arms apart and quickly retreated.

“You think you can flee?” Lin Yun snorted. When he moved, the ground trembled as though a colossal mountain was being moved. Along with a dragon's roar, Lin Yun caught up with Qin Hao with one step. He started to form seals before unleashing them towards Qin Hao. The seals were naturally the Blue Dragon Seal, Golden Dragon Seal, Silver Dragon Seal, and Sovereign Dragon Seal!

As three radiances bloomed from his fingers, an ancient dragon seal that was like a miniature sun was descending from the sky and collided with Qin Hao.

Taking the blow head-on, Qin Hao threw out a mouthful of blood and flew into a rage. But he could hear the wind howling beside his ears just when he wanted to raise his head. This was because Lin Yun was flying over with one kick, and a hundred thousand dragon runes poured into his right foot. Shortly after, Lin Yun’s right foot came in contact with Qin Hao’s face.

“Now for the third move!” Lin Yun roared, and his dragon origin went berserk with dragons flying from his body.

Sovereign Dragon Fist—Soaring Divine Dragon!

When his punch landed on Qin Hao’s chest, his attack instantly shattered the dragon origin around Qin Hao. As more dragons continued to fly from his body, a thousand dragons soon covered the entire sky.

When Qin Hao was sent out of the Nirvana Stage, he created a vast crater upon falling to the ground and immediately fainted. This made the surroundings fall into a dead silence, and they were all shocked by this scene. No one expected this outcome, including Hua Hongyu and the others. They were shocked as they looked at Lin Yun with disbelief filling their pupils.

“Who’s first?” Lin Yun hovered in the air, his hair fluttering in the sky while he looked at Zhang Ying, Chen Jun, and Li Yuxi.

This stunned the three because they never expected Lin Yun to be so arrogant to come after them when he was done humiliating Qin Hao. The three scrambled to fight Lin Yun earlier, but they were no longer as confident as before after witnessing how he beat Qin Hao.

Even Li Yuxi, known to be the strongest, was uncertain, and this contrasting scene shocked everyone. They began to wonder if Lin Yun would really become first on the Nirvana Banquet.

“That brat…” The Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion’s pavilion master was shocked, and he began to recall his conversation with the old patriarch. He now understood why Lin Yun was the bearer of the Wind God Order, and there was indeed something impressive about him.

Standing beside Yan Tianchen, Yue Weiwei gently smiled despite her pale face. Even Yan Tianchen gulped down a mouthful of saliva and was shocked by Lin Yun’s performance. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Li Yuxi, Zhang Ying, and Chen Jun began to hesitate. None of them wanted to stand out under Lin Yun’s gaze, and this scene instantly sparked a discussion amongst the audience.

“It looks like the holy lands aren’t impressive after all. The first on the Nirvana Banquet is just a name, and we’re fighting for ourselves!” Lin Yun looked at the three with mockery and coldly continued, “The three of you don’t want to fight me one by one, and I also don’t want to let you guys off. The three of you can come to me together. If I lose, I’ll give up on being first in the Nirvana Banquet. If I win, all of you will apologize to the Profound Fairy and me!”
