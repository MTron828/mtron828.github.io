Chapter 1848 - Various Opportunities

Lin Yun sat on the ground, and the aura he released began to increase. This situation lasted for seven days before his sword intent and dragon origin had become stable.

This made Lin Yun let out a breath and slowly stood up. Sensing the violent power within his body, it felt like he was an ancient dragon that had awakened. He took a deep breath before he pushed his palm forth.

This was only pure energy, but it felt as though there was a mountain being pushed in front of him. Far away, space began to distort. This enveloped Lin Yun in shock, and he muttered, “Luckily, my sword intent also made a breakthrough. Otherwise, it would look a little weird for a swordsman like me to attack my enemies with my fist…”

But he was suddenly teased by what he thought. This caused the corner of his lips to curl up, and a gentle breeze blew across his face. After all, that was pretty cool, wasn’t it? Who said swordsmen couldn’t fight with their fists?Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Lin Yun felt as though he had the physique of a beast, and he could smash anyone apart with a punch. The last remnant of energy left behind by the Black Tortoise Martial Emperor gave his body a drastic transformation.

He tested out various sword techniques in this tattered secret realm, along with various secret techniques, before he stopped. His strength had undergone a drastic transformation, and the transformation was unbelievable. It would make anyyone who underwent it feel like they were dreaming, but Lin Yun maintained his composure for a long time before he accepted reality. He was confident of killing Yu Wenxiu and the Fire God General, even without the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown now.

“Time to refine the Black Tortoise Chains.” Lin Yun wasn’t in a hurry to leave, and took out the blood heart essence given to him by Gu Jun before refining it. The Black Tortoise Chains were completely refined into his body, becoming one with him and coursing within his body.

With a single thought, nine chains flew out from his palm, and each chain was flickering with terrifying lightning. When the lightning crackled, he could control the chains like extensions of his arm, and it was more convenient than coiling them around on his wrist.

Lin Yun suddenly recalled the nine-colored lightning flames that he couldn’t summon, and the thought of fusing them into the Black Thunder Chains crossed his mind. As soon as he thought about it, nine-colored sacred flames coursed through his body from the nine acupoints. When the flames spread onto the chains, the chains looked as though they had come to life, turning into pitch-black metallic lightning serpents with nine-colored lightning flames blazing within their pupils. They were like the Nine-Headed Hydra, and they unleashed a terrifying power within the hands of Lin Yun.

“It really works!” The corner of Lin Yun’s lips curled, and he laughed, “Hahaha! Come again!”

Since this method was possible, then let the storm come more ferociously. As the dragon origin rumbled within his violet palace, it poured into his palm and the nine lightning serpents instantly grew to a hundred feet.

“Hahaha! Let it come more ferociously!” Lin Yun’s face became red, and a hint of madness flashed through his pupils. The golden human within his sword sea raised its hands to the sky. The Azure Dragon Sword Soul was summoned forth, combining with the Black Thunder Chains and the lightning serpents began to expand.

It was as though this had lifted the restriction on the Black Thunder Chains, and the lightning serpents grew to the size of pythons, reaching over a thousand feet. An ancient tortoise rune also appeared on Lin Yun’s palm and shrouded Lin Yun’s body before forming a tortoiseshell screen.

At this moment, his weight increased, and the ground cracked beneath his feet. In the next moment, sand and rocks flew along with a violent storm. When the tortoise rune bloomed, this became an unexpected surprise.

“Black tortoise to defend and lightning serpents to attack. Is this the true profundity of the Thunder Black Tortoise’s lineage?” Lin Yun was inwardly alarmed, and his pupils were filled with joy. This was the genuine appearance of the Black Thunder Chains. In his hands, he would let its name spread throughout the Kunlun Realm and not let down the Black Thunder Martial Emperor’s name.

“Stow!” Lin Yun roared, and lightning serpents of over a thousand feet entered his palm. The Black Tortoise Saint Rune on him also gradually disappeared. This was a good treasure that could be used to attack and defend.

“Let’s go out after practicing a secret technique.” Lin Yun muttered, withdrawing his thoughts. He wanted to practice the Nether Shackle left behind by Jian Qingkong, who used it to deal with the Demonspirit Clan.

Lin Yun had a deep impression of the Nether Shackle’s power. Back at the Ancient Barren Battlefield, the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit’s power was sealed by the Nether Shackle, and the shackles still remained a hundred thousand years later.

His conversation with the Black Tortoise Martial Emperor brought a sense of urgency to him. The current Kunlun Realm might seem prosperous, but he would run into the Demonspirit Clan sooner or later, and he needed to prepare trump cards in advance.

Back in the Demigod Wine Cellar, Gu Jun, Mei Zihua, and An Liuyan received huge benefits after refining the Demigod Wine. If it was only about the Demigod Wine, Gu Jun had received greater benefits than Lin Yun. After all, the higher the cultivation, the more beneficial the Demigod Wine would be.

Gu Jun’s face was rosy, even after he lost two drops of heart blood essence, and he was the first to awaken. He had long erased the imprint on the Glory Saint Artifact—Myriad Scales Armor. He was waiting for Lin Yun to return it to him. At that time, Lin Yun would be covered in Glory Saint Artifacts.

Just the thought of that alone was enough to send a chill down Gu Jun’s spine because of the sheer number of Glory Saint Artifacts Lin Yun possessed. In addition to his harvest this time, Lin Yun would possess the qualification to compete with the strongest holy sons in the Divine Dragon Era.

Lin Yun might be a little weaker now because he came from a lower realm, but he had infinite potential. Perhaps he could only forge the path of a Sword God for himself that no one walked on. Gu Jun felt emotional just thinking it. But what if Lin Yun became a Sword God? That wouldn’t change the fact he was a scumbag. That was how Gu Jun comforted himself.

After thinking about it, Gu Jun smiled and happily took a sip of wine. The saint wine was different from the others he drank, and it tasted really good. But as he drank, his heart felt empty because he also wanted to be a scumbag if he could!

“Elder Gu, how are your injuries?” An Liuyan opened her eyes. Her eyes shone brightly, and her skin became even fairer after drinking the Demigod Wine.

Gu Jun came to his senses and smiled, “Not bad. The Demigod Wine is pretty effective.”

“Elder Gu, have you reached the Quasi-Saint Realm?” An Liuyan asked happily.

“Yeah. It’s still not bad.” Gu Jun smiled. “The Quasi-Saint Realm has nine stages, and I managed to take a few more stages after relying on the Demigod Wine.”

“What stage are you in?” An Liuyan asked with a smile.

Gu Jun was waiting for her to ask the question. When An Liuyan asked, he raised four fingers.

This made An Liuyan surprised, and she smiled, “As expected of Elder Gu, to reach the fourth stage the moment you entered the Quasi-Saint Realm.”

“It’s alright. What about Boss An?” Gu Jun asked with a smile. This moment was the highlight of his life. Compared to the embarrassment of having his heart blood extracted earlier, it wasn’t an exaggeration to say that he was proud of himself at this moment.

“There’s no way I can be compared to Elder Gu. I only reached the pinnacle of the Profound Life Stage.” An Liuyan smiled.

Waving his hand, Gu Jun responded with a smile as well, “Boss An doesn’t have to be modest. The Demigod Wine will last for a long time. When you go back, you can choose to make a breakthrough to the profound Death Stage, and you can even reach the Nirvana Stage in half a year.

“As for the Quasi-Saint Realm, your odds are high, even if it won’t be easy.” He wasn’t trying to comfort An Liuyan, but that was how magical the Demigod Wine was.

Right then, Mei Zihua slowly opened his eyes. Unlike the two, he was still at the Dragon Pulse Realm, but he gave everyone a different feeling with a powerful aura enveloping him.

“Thirteenth-grade Saint Spiritualist?” Gu Jun asked tentatively.

But Mei Zihua shook his head and smiled, “Quasi-Heavenly Spiritualist.”

Hearing that made Gu Jun take a cold breath, and his facial expression became complicated. He commented, “As expected of a descendant from one of the Ten Musical Clans.”

The Quasi-Heavenly Spiritualist was equivalent to the mental energy of a Quasi-Saint. But there was no way Mei Zihua could confront genuine Quasi-Saint experts, and he had to master the specific methods. For example, he needed to promote his Great Saint Tune to Saint King Tune and acquire more ancient scores. If he could find some divine abilities, only then could he be considered a genuine Quasi-Saint.

But it was still unbelievable, and Gu Jun couldn’t help feeling a little sour. Thinking about it again, it was reasonable because Mei Zihua already mastered the Great Saint Tune. The Ten Musical Clans did not have any shortage of resources, not to mention Mei Zihua already stood in a higher position compared to many since his birth. So the Demigod Wine merely excavated his potential and accumulation.

“Congratulations, Big Brother Mei.” An Liuyan smiled. “In the future, the young master will still have to rely on Big Brother Mei.”

Waving his hand, Mei Zihua smiled, “This is a trivial matter. After all, I have to thank Brother Lin for the Demigod Wine, but that’s not my greatest harvest in the Black Tortoise Void Sea.”

“Oh?” Gu Jun smiled, silently watching Mei Zihua putting on an act.

“My mental state.” Mei Zihua sighed with a serious expression. He wasn’t putting on an act. It was undeniable that he was strong, but it didn’t necessarily mean he was powerful. Only those who could unleash their full power when facing danger could be considered powerful.

He recalled his bold words of saying that he would ensure Lin Yun’s safety and how he needed help from Lin Yun to resolve his crisis multiple times.

“I don’t have many life-and-death experiences, and I have been reborn on this trip. At least I have some experience now.” Mei Zihua sighed.

“Haha. How surprising for Saint Hands Mei Zihua to be so humble. I remember how arrogant you used to be.” Gu Jun smiled, and Mei Zihua did not argue with him.

Right then, the pool exploded and a person flew out, appearing before the three. But when An Liuyan, Mei Zihua, and Gu Jun looked at the appearance of this person, they were left completely dumbfounded.

This naturally made Lin Yun puzzled, and An Liuyan was the first to respond. She smiled, “Young Master, you look better this way.”

“F-F… F… Flower…” Mei Zihua stuttered as he pointed at Lin Yun. He was stuttering uncontrollably, and couldn’t say “Flower Burial” like he wanted.

Only then, did Lin Yun realize that he was restored to his initial appearance when his body was reforged. His current appearance was Lin Yun and not Lin Xiao.
