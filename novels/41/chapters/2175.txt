Chapter 2176: Ninth of Next Month

Lin Yun didn’t doubt what Ye Guhan said. He stayed for seven days before leaving the secret realm.

When he came out, the Heavenly Yi Saint Lord greeted, “You’re out?”

Lin Yun nodded politely. But just when he was about to leave, the Heavenly Yi Saint Lord asked, “Speaking of which, what cultivation technique did you practice inside?”

“It’s nothing. I’m just just casually practicing,” Lin Yun smiled.

The Heavenly Yi Saint Lord was briefly stunned, before he muttered, “To cause such a huge commotion when you’re just casually practicing.”

“It’s still alright.” Lin Yun smiled and left. After leaving the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda, Lin Yun took a deep breath. It had only been three days in the outside world, but it felt as though a lifetime had passed. Speaking of which, the Heavenly Yi Saint Lord’s expression was a little weird, but he didn’t know what the latter was thinking.

“Ye Qingtian, long time no see.” Just when Lin Yun was wondering if he should ask the Heavenly Yi Saint Lord about it, a voice disrupted him.

Raising his head, it was the Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden, Wang Muyan. Wang Muyan was still the same as before, looking bewitching with a voluptuous figure that made her chest bulge even if she was wearing a loose robe.

“What a coincidence,” Lin Yun nodded.

Wang Muyan didn’t attend the Blue Dragon Record, but was cultivating within the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda. Lin Yun stayed in the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda for three years, while Wang Muyan probably stayed there for at least ten years. The feeling she gave Lin Yun was different; there was something mysterious and profound about her.

“It’s not a coincidence. I have been waiting for you when I saw the Azure River Sword Saint leaving. I expected that you’re about to come out, and I was right,” Wang Muyan smiled.

“Why are you looking for me?” Lin Yun asked.

“Can’t I look for you even if I have nothing to say? Furthermore, I haven’t congratulated you for becoming the Heavenly Dragon Lord.” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Thanks.”

“Shall we take a stroll?”

“Sure.”

Wang Muyan took the initiative to invite Lin Yun, but Lin Yun had no idea what she was trying to do.

“Ye Qingtian, why don’t you tell me how you became the Heavenly Dragon Lord? I heard that you defeated the representative from the Blood Moon Divine Sect,” Wang Muyan asked.

“Demonic sect,” Lin Yun corrected.

“They’re the same. I want to hear from you personally because it is not accurate when you hear it from others,” Wang Muyan smiled. The two cultivated within the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda before, and they had become closer with each other. Lin Yun didn’t have any ill feelings towards her, so he told her the truth.

Lin Yun calmy explained while Wang Muyan listened seriously, and she would even ask further details from time to time.

“So the rumors are true. You became the public enemy for a demoness, and you even pushed her to the Indigo Dragon Lord’s position,” Wang Muyan said in a slightly envious tone for some reason.

“How great would it be if someone did that for me.” Wang Muyan muttered, but she was looking at Lin Yun with anticipation.

“Don’t look at me,” Lin Yun said.

“Aren’t you the Holy Maiden Killer? So why are you nervous? Are the rumors fake, and you’re not that much of a scumbag?” Wang Muyan teased.

“Rumors also say that you practice the Thousand-Faced Demonic Art and often practiced dual cultivation with others. Is that true?” Lin Yun retorted.

Wang Muyan wasn’t furious, but smiled, “What if I say that they’re true?”

“Uh…” Lin Yun was stumped because he never thought of that reply. But based on his interaction with Wang Muyan, he could tell that she wasn’t someone like that. She might seem slutty on the outside, but she wouldn’t get close to anyone, and men were only playthings to her. At times, Lin Yun could even see a hint of divinity on her, which confused him.

“I would rather believe in my own judgement. You’re not such a person, so what do others say about you got to do with me?” Lin Yun said after a brief pause.

Hearing what Lin Yun said, Wang Muyan couldn’t smile anymore, but looked at Lin Yun, “Ye Qingtian, you’re a good person.”

Lin Yun smiled sheepishly because he never expected that he would receive a "good person" title one day.

“You’re not allowed to smile. I’m serious about this,” Wang Muyan said.

“Alright, I’ll not laugh anymore,” Lin Yun replied.

“That’s more like it,” Wang Muyan smiled. Her smile was like a blooming rose. She continued, “Ye Qingtian, it has been a long time since you returned to Sword Sect, right? You should make a trip back before the ninth of next month.”

“Why should I return?” Lin Yun asked.

“You can go somewhere else as well, such as the Divine Dragon Empire, the Eastern Seas, the West Desert. The world is so big, so why trap yourself in the Eastern Desolation and Heavenly Dao Sect?” Wang Muyan smiled.

Lin Yun suddenly noticed that Wang Muyan was hinting at something, and something might happen with the Heavenly Dao Sect the next month. His face changed, before he asked, “Something is going to happen with the Heavenly Dao Sect?”

Wang Muyan didn’t reply, but smiled, “There’s no eternal beauty in the world, no flower that never withers. Even deities will fall, not to mention a holy land.”

“Are you hinting at me? You’re not afraid that I’ll tell the Thousand Plume Great Saint about it?” Lin Yun asked.

“I’m not hinting at you, but I’m blatantly telling you about it. Since I dare to tell you about it, I’m naturally not afraid that you’ll tell that to someone. Furthermore, how do you know that I’m not lying to you?” Wang Muyan smiled cunningly. Seeing that Lin Yun wanted to say something, Wang Muyan said first, “I’m actually not envious of that demoness because I can’t become an enemy with the entire world for a man. So I never hoped that someone could do that for me, but I hope that you can survive as a friend.”

“You swore an oath before,” Lin Yun said.

“That’s right. I did swear an oath, but don’t you know that I can only go with the flow when the time comes?” Wang Muyan said.

Lin Yun looked at Wang Muyan, but said nothing.

“The Heavenly Dao Sect might seem strong, but it’s internally torn apart, like a giant tree riddled with pests,” Wang Muyan said. “But those pests hold a high position, and they have been in the Heavenly Dao Sect for generations. Since they’re not concerned about it, why would an outsider like you be concerned?”

Lin Yun was powerless to refute because he stayed in both the Sword Sect and Heavenly Dao Sect. The Sword Sect might be weaker in comparison, but they were united; however, that couldn’t be seen in the Heavenly Dao Sect.

The descendants of the four major clans held a high position, and even most of the saint disciples were occupied by the four clans’ disciples. Strictly speaking, even his identity as Ye Qingtian was from one of the four clans.

“Let me ask you a question. Is your identity really the Blood Moon Divine Maiden?” Lin Yun asked.

“I can be, and yet I can not be. Just like you, you can be Flower Burial, but you can also be simply Lin Yun,” Wang Muyan said.

Lin Yun was briefly stunned before he smiled. A Blood Moon Divine Maiden and Flower Burial, both holding a high position within the Heavenly Dao Sect. They were both outsiders, but they were talking about the life and death of the Heavenly Dao Sect. He really didn’t know what to say about the Heavenly Dao Sect.

“I’ll take my leave first.” Wang Muyan took a deep look at Lin Yun before she left, leaving behind a lingering fragrance in the air.

“Ninth of next month… There’s only half a month left,” Lin Yun muttered. What Wang Muyan said gave Lin Yun a sense of urgency, but he couldn’t completely believe what she said. After all, if Lin Yun told the Thousand Plume Great Saint about this, and it turned out to be a lie, it might mess up the Thousand Plume Great Saint’s sense of judgement.

“Ninth of next month… What day is that?” Lin Yun muttered. He couldn’t interfere in this matter since he was only an outsider within the Heavenly Dao Sect. If the four major clans knew of his identity, no one could ensure that no one would come after his Firmament Saint Cloth. Aside from his senior brother, the two mistresses, and his master, he didn’t have many people he could trust within the Heavenly Dao Sect.

“Lin Yun, what do you intend to do?” Lil’ Purple asked in a concerned tone. She persuaded, “I feel that she’s not entirely wrong. You have reached your objectives in coming to the Heavenly Dao Sect, and you also contributed in helping the Dao Yang Holy Son to become the Azure Dragon Lord…”

“My matters are done, but what about you? You don’t want the Solar Lunar Divine Rune?” Lin Yun smiled.

“The Solar Lunar Divine Rune isn’t as important as your life, and you have spoiled so many plans of the Blood Moon Sect. Although Wang Muyan didn’t say it blatantly, she's hinting to you that the Blood Moon Sect will come after you,” Lil’ Purple said.

Lin Yun briefly pondered, before he said, “She’s right, but not entirely right. A Quasi-Saint like me can’t do anything before the tidal wave, but I can’t become a deserter knowing that the Heavenly Dao Sect is in danger.”

“So?” Lil’ Purple asked.

“So I will help to the best of my abilities on the prerequisite of ensuring my safety. After all, my senior sister is here,” Lin Yun said. No matter what others say, he wouldn’t allow himself to become a deserter as a swordsman. His sword was to protect those he cared about, and that was his path as a swordsman.

Lin Yun changed his mind and headed to the Profound Maiden Courtyard instead of heading back to Indigothunder Peak. He planned to cultivate there during this period of time.

The Heavenly Yin Palace was quiet at night. Wang Muyan was facing a man in a hall. This person was the Blood Moon Divine Son, Zhao Tianyu, whom Su Ziyao was looking for.

Su Ziyao had led the Blood Word Battalion to encircle the Blood Moon Sect’s branches throughout the Eastern Desolation, focusing on looking for Zhao Tianyu. But who could’ve expected that Zhao Tianyu would be within the Heavenly Dao Sect?

“Muyan, are you sure that the Solar Lunar Divine Rune is in the Celestial Pool?” Zhao Tianyu asked.

.

“I’m sure of it,” Wang Muyan said. “Bai Shuying has been using it to cultivate in the Celestial Pool, but there’s something special about the seal there. So even if I know the location, I can’t undo the seal. If I try to forcibly break the seal, the Solar Lunar Divine Rune might flee. Only those who are proficient in spiritual runes can appease the Solar Lunar Divine Rune and receive its acknowledgment.”

This requirement was high. Not only did it require someone with a high attainment in spiritual runes, but also someone who was born with intimacy for divine runes.

Zhao Tianyu briefly paused, before he said, “That’s easy. Someone will deal with that at that time, and that person must have a way.”

“Who is it?” Wang Muyan asked.

“Someone you know,” Zhao Tianyu revealed a mysterious smile and said nothing further. Looking at the bright moon in the sky, he muttered, “Ninth of next month, we’ve waited for this day for hundreds of years, and everything depends on it.”

Suddenly, he briefly paused, then sighed, “You’re right. Ye Qingtian is a formidable foe of the divine cult, and I’ve underestimated him…”
