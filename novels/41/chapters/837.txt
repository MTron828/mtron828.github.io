Chapter 838 - Head of all Dragons!

With all nine phenomena fused together, Lin Yun’s sword destroyed the entire barrier. When fragments of the barrier fragments landed on the Nine Dragon Lake, huge craters were formed that shot water into the sky.

Yu Haotian’s punch damaged the barrier when he sent Lin Yun flying. But even then, the barrier repaired itself after a full second. Lin Yun’s sword, however, destroyed the entire barrier. It was such a shocking development that the Sacred Alliance judges were dumbfounded.

In the next moment, Lin Yun’s attack landed on Yu Haotian. Instantly, all of Yu Haotian’s origin energy was destroyed, leaving nine sinister wounds.

Lin Yun’s sword stabbed Yu Haotian in the chest, one inch from his heart. However, Yu Haotian displayed extraordinary composure as he simultaneously threw a punch at Lin Yun. If Lin Yun’s sword continued forward, Yu Haotian’s punch would shatter Lin Yun’s skull. This was a suicidal move.

Lin Yun couldn’t accept this outcome. With a light flashing in his eyes, a dazzling brilliance exploded from the tip of his sword. Boundless spiritual sword intent poured into Yu Haotian’s chest and sent him flying.

Throwing up blood, Yu Haotian spun several times in the air before he smashed into the ground. When he got back on his feet, his chest had a huge hole and his face was extremely pale.

Lin Yun also wasn’t in a good condition. After all, almost everyone would have died if they smashed through the barrier. Fortunately for Lin Yun, his spiritual sword intent dissolved at least 50% of Yu Haotian’s attack before his Azure Dragon Battle Physique took the rest. So Yu Haotian clearly suffered more damage than he did.

“Spiritual sword intent!” Yu Haotian coughed with an unpleasant face. He thought that he flipped the situation and beat Lin Yun. However, Lin Yun managed to reverse the situation yet again.

In Yu Haotian’s view, there was no way someone in the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm could execute Lin Yun’s sword. Not even a true Heavenly Soul Realm expert could have pulled off what Lin Yun did. Compared to Lin Yun, the sword techniques of Nangong Wanyu and the others were basically nothing.

Both of them caught their breath before Lin Yun charged at Yu Haotian once again. This time around, Yu Haotian relied on his advantage in cultivation to push his movement technique to the limit. Then, he unleashed a barrage of attacks.

Lin Yun was also in a terrible state from this fight. In fact, the ferocity of this battle was unlike anything he ever experienced. Executing the Cloud Soaring Art, he moved around the stage to avoid Yu Haotian’s attacks. Every time he dodged, he would counterattack.

“Where do the flowers bloom!” Lin Yun suddenly discovered that Yu Haotian had a few flaws in his movement technique . Although the flaws were insignificant, Lin Yun still keenly sensed them. Pushing his spiritual sword intent to the pinnacle of lesser mastery, Lin Yun took seven steps forward and stabbed his sword out as a rose bloomed on the tip of his sword

Facing this attack, Yu Haotian had shock written on his face. Purple moonlight exploded as he disappeared from sight.

Indigomoon Demonwalk again? Lin Yun’s eyes flashed because this movement technique was really bizarre. However, Yu Haotian’s attempt was useless because Lin Yun already found its flaw. Before his sword, all movement techniques were futile.

A bizarre scene occurred once more as Yu Haotian was stabbed by the sword ray in mid-air. Yu Haotian threw up a mouthful of blood as Lin Yun’s sword pierced his right shoulder. Once he was hit, he was forced out of his movement technique.

“Damn it! Overlord Fist–Sea Quake!” A terrifying purple glow spread out behind Yu Haotian like an ocean.

“Supreme Dominance!” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly as he combined six forms of the Overlord Sword together. When he swung his sword down, the ocean created by Yu Haotian collapsed completely.

“Haha, I didn’t think you could force me this far. But this is the end...I don’t want to waste any more time with you.” Yu Haotian landed on the ground with his fighting spirits blazing in the depth of his eyes.

Is he finally going to bring out his trump card? Lin Yun’s eyes flickered as he looked at Yu Haotian coldly.

“This is the last fist of the Overlord Fist. I never thought I would have to use it in this banquet. I was going to use it on the geniuses from the other domains, but I guess I have to change my plans. The name of this fist is Sky Shatter!” Yu Haotian clenched his fist together as he surged with a violent aura.

When he clenched his fist, a demonic snake with blue eyes slithered out of his body and soared into the sky. The sky was now dark as Yu Haotian’s fist emitted a crimson radiance.

“Martial soul! Yu Haotian brought out his martial soul…”

“It looks like he’s really staking it all on this attack. Just how powerful is this punch that he had to bring out his martial soul?”

“What a terrifying aura. Is that the mythical snake, Bashe?” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Bashe is the snake of devouring. To devour the sky, it must be Bashe…” When Yu Haotian brought out his marital soul, the faces of all the geniuses became fearful.

“Hmph. Senior brother once killed a ninth soul Heavenly Soul Realm expert. I don’t believe that sword slave can handle it.” Qing Ruoyou’s sinister face flushed with excitement. At this moment, she could imagine Lin Yun’s death.

The other geniuses in the top ten also locked their brows together because the Bashe not only dyed the sky black, it also obstructed its opponent’s senses. If Lin Yun’s sword intent couldn’t lock onto Yu Haotian, he would be in trouble.

Facing the pressure coming from Yu Haotian, Lin Yun was facing unprecedented pressure. The Bashe’s blue eyes stared at him and suppressed his senses. If he was a normal person, he would have collapsed from the pressure. However, Lin Yun’s heart and sword never wavered, so his eyes blazed with fighting spirit.

His spiritual sword intent began to roar violently as waves of his sword intent spread. Along with the brilliance of his sword, Lin Yun’s eyes shined with brilliance as well. In that moment, he unleashed his Aurora Dragon Eyes and his eyes pierced through the dark like the sun.

“Iris Sword Array—Unrivalled!” Yu Haotian’s punch was worthy of Lin Yun bringing out the Iris Sword Array. Lin Yun’s eyes flashed brightly and he reversed his circulation. Instantly, the ground exploded as his boundless domineering aura spread out with the Iris Sword Array.

Terrifying sword intent poured out of Lin Yun as his sword array spun and towre the wind apart. At the same time, Yu Haotian’s punch also turned the sky dark once more.

“Primal Origin, Praise the Phoenix!” Lin Yun roared and a phoenix cry echoed out behind him. An ancient ice phoenix containing boundless sword intent flew at Yu Haotian.

Both Lin Yun and Yu Haotian’s attacks could easily kill any Heavenly Soul Realm expert. So, the stage started to split apart under the forces.

“This isn’t good!” The chief judge’s face changed and the Sacred Alliance moved to block the fluctuation from the stage. However, the ten judges were having a hard time blocking the shockwave. If they weren’t there, the destruction would have been unimaginable.

Every single spectator had fear on their face. Just what kind of geniuses are they? No one could believe that the attacks were equivalent to Heavenly Soul Realm experts.

Yu Haotian’s punch only lasted for a split second before the ice phoenix made it crumble. Then, the rest of Lin Yun’s sword hit Yu Haotian, crushing the latter’s Indigomoon Sacred Light and origin energy.

Yu Haotian went flying from the impact. Then, his dragon projection shattered and his boundless profound amber aura flew towards Lin Yun. In the next second, Lin Yun’s Five-Clawed Golden Dragon grew a pair of horns.

“No! No! No!” Yu Haotian roared with despair and disbelief. He was under great pain because his origin energy was crumbling while his physique started to crack.

There could only be one king over all dragons. At this moment, Lin Yun became the king of all dragons.
