Chapter 1861 - Where's The Azure Dragon!

“That old goat is getting on my nerves. I’ll hold him down; you go and take that brat’s life!” The Ming Cult’s Quasi-Saint said to the Liu Saint Clan’s Quasi-Saint. When he was done, he immediately brought out his constellation and dashed towards Lin Yun.

He first summoned a bright sun behind him, then pointed one hand at the sea with a moon condensing on the sea. Ultimately, the sun and moon combined into a ‘Ming’ word flying towards Gu Jun.

Gu Jun wanted to break free but could do nothing because the Ming Cult’s Quasi-Saint was determined to hold him down. No matter what he tried, he couldn’t do anything, and his anxiety even made him reveal his flaws.

“Get lost!” The Liu Saint Clan’s Quasi-Saint turned around and pushed his palm forth in Lin Yun and An Liuyan’s direction. This naturally made everyone exclaim because if his attack landed, both Lin Yun and An Liuyan would lose their lives.

Right then, zither music resounded. Mei Zihua was strumming his fingers across the zither creating a violent storm. His hand speed was insanely fast, and seven crimson musical notes flew out.

When the first musical note clashed against the attack of the Liu Saint Clan’s Quasi-Saint, the second musical note had already arrived. This naturally startled the Liu Saint Clan’s Quasi-Saint into retreating. But it was too late because the third musical note flew over, leaving a sinister gash on his body.

“Quasi-Master Musician!” The Liu Saint Clan’s Quasi-Saint looked at Mei Zihua with shock.

“Quasi-Saint!” The geniuses of the other holy lands were also shocked when they saw this scene. After all, those who were Quasi-Master Musicians were comparable to those at the Quasi-Saint Realm in the martial path.

“Lin Xiao, you can focus on treating your injuries. With me around, you won’t die so easily.” Mei Zihua smiled, revealing an arrogant smile. As he slammed his hands on the zither strings, musical notes flew out, and the Vermilion Bird Seal on his forehead bloomed.

Multiple waves reaching a few hundred feet rose from the ocean, and an ancient aura was being emitted from him. The immense pressure alone forced the Liu Saint Clan’s Quasi-Saint to take many steps back.

“Sky Incineration Flame!” Mei Zihua smiled as crimson flames blazed within his pupils. Clenching his right hand, he pushed it forth, and a Vermilion Bird flew out from the zither.

The Liu Saint Clan’s Quasi-Saint was stopped ten miles away, but Mei Zihua’s music had reached an unbelievable height. This made Mei Zihua smile as he gave up on the zither and flew forth with a flute. An ancient cry echoed across the sky as a vermilion bird descended, arriving beneath Mei Zihua.

“You bastard, why didn’t you help earlier?!” Gu Jun cursed after letting out a breath of relief at this scene.

Mei Zihua smiled and continued to press down on the Liu Saint Clan’s Quasi-Saint with his immense aura.

This naturally relieved An Liuyan, and she sensed the dragon scales within Lin Yun’s body were starting to move. Ten-odd dragon scales then shot out of his body the next moment, and the Blue Dragon Bone released a dragon roar from within his body.

As Lin Yun opened his eyes, the blood clots within his body crumbled as boundless vitality poured out from within his body, followed by a powerful heartbeat that gave everyone a feeling like a divine dragon had awakened. All of his broken ribs had instantly recovered.

“How is this possible?!”

“He has recovered?!” Everyone was shocked by what they saw. The shock this brought to them was even greater than when Lin Yun defeating Zhuge Qingyun earlier.

After all, Lin Yun was heavily injured a minute ago and yet he instantly recovered from all of his injuries in a flash. Not only had he recovered from his injuries, but his aura was stronger. It turned out that Lin Yun had undergone a quantitative change when he swung his sword earlier.

“Liuyan, I’m fine now.” Lin Yun said. Before An Liuyan could reply, he soared into the sky and headed toward the Ming Cult’s Quasi-Saint. The Flower Burial Sword also flew over to his side.

He turned to look at the Flower Burial Sword and smiled, “Flower Burial, do you want to have a race?”

The sword replied with a buzz as if it was nodding.

“Let’s race, then.” Lin Yun smiled. When he turned his head back, his face changed, and his speed increased with the Flower Burial Sword quickly following behind him. Looking at the Ming Cult’s Quasi-Saint, Lin Yun coldly said, “A loser like you wants my life? Let me see how capable you are, then!”

He wasn’t boasting because the Ming Cult’s Quasi-Saint was injured by him when he was fighting Gu Jun back in the Black Tortoise Void Sea.

Having salt rubbed on his wound, the Ming Cult’s Quasi-Saint threw out a mouthful of blood, “Lin Xiao, come if you dare!”

“Hahaha, here I come, then!” Lin Yun laughed.

This was too insane. Everyone was startled by this scene. After all, Lin Yun had just placed his life on the line to clash with Zhuge Qingyun earlier, and now he was placing his life on the line again to face another Quasi-Saint. One must know that the Myriad Scales Armor was destroyed, so they didn’t know where Lin Yun got his confidence from.

“Is Lin Xiao insane?!” Xiao Yuanqi exclaimed.

“That fellow must be a monster.” Ji Lingfeng was also shocked. He was arrogant and never cowered whenever he faced someone in the same generation, even if the other party was stronger than him. Even in the Divine Phoenix Mountain, Ji Lingfeng was a bright pearl.

But he had to admit that he was filled with admiration for Lin Xiao. He dared to be arrogant when facing someone in the same generation, but he would back down if he faced someone who’s a Quasi-Saint, unlike Lin Xiao.

“Get lost!” The Ming Cult’s Quasi-Saint knocked Gu Jun away and wore a sinister smile when he saw Lin Yun approaching him. His gaze was on Lin Yun’s chest, where no scales were covering his chest.

He was smiling, but that was the same for Lin Yun. Lin Yun then suddenly stopped when he was about to get close to the Ming Cult’s Quasi-Saint. This naturally made everyone wonder if Lin Yun had cowered.

But Lin Yun suddenly opened his right hand and pushed his hand forth. The lightning flames that remained within his body gushed out and gathered in his right palm. In the next second, nine shackles simultaneously flew out.

The sky immediately became dark, with countless bolts of lightning flashing across the horizon. Lin Yun looked like a god of thunder at this moment as he roared, “All lightning, heed my order!”

Countless lightning lit up his face, and the shackles instantly struck the Ming Cult’s Quasi-Saint, causing the latter to throw out a mouthful of blood as he was sent a few hundred meters away.

But before he could breathe, his pupils suddenly narrowed because nine lightning serpents were behind him. “You bastard!”

The commotion caused by the nine lightning serpents was great, and it even emitted a hint of Emperor Realm aura, causing the face of the Ming Cult’s Quasi-Saint to turn pale.

He didn’t hesitate to unleash all of his attacks but was still forced to retreat under the lightning. It didn’t take long for him to be covered in wounds under the nine serpents’ attacks, and the lightning flames were seeping into his body through the wounds. Lin Yun had enjoyed this treatment back then when he underwent his tribulation, and it had replayed itself on the Ming Cult’s Quasi-Saint.

“Hahaha! Come again!” Lin Yun clenched his fist, and the nine lightning serpents returned to him. But before the Ming Cult’s Quasi-Saint could let out a breath of relief, the Flower Burial Sword was already flying over under Lin Yun’s manipulation.

The Ming Cult’s Quasi-Saint bore the pain and knocked the Flower Burial Sword back. Taking this opportunity, the Ming Cult’s Quasi-Saint retreated ten miles away and relied on his saint aura to suppress the lightning within his body.

On the other hand, Lin Yun stood on the sword in mid-air.

“Wind, come upon my command!” Lin Yun roared as a powerful gale began to appear within the surroundings. Empowered by the powerful gale, this further brought Lin Yun’s speed to a whole new height.

“Lightning!” But that wasn’t all. Lightning bolts were flashing along with another roar. His Azure Dragon Intent was at the sixth grade, and he could command wind and lightning intents even without comprehending them.

Under this momentum, the Ming Cult’s Quasi-Saint trembled, and he didn’t dare to take the risk. He wanted to back off now. This was something that no one had expected. He also didn’t hesitate to put his thoughts into action by turning around and fleeing.

This instantly made everyone’s jaws drop because a Quasi-Saint had fled in a fight against someone at the pinnacle of the Profound Life Stage.

“How boring. I have yet to even bring out my strength.” Lin Yun smiled.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“That fellow really knows how to put on an act.” Ji Lingfeng cursed.

“Where’s the Azure Dragon?!” Before everyone could come to their senses, Lin Yun roared as lightning began to rumble in the sky, with a massive dragon wandering in the clouds. The Liu Saint Clan’s Quasi-Saint, fighting Mei Zihua, was terrified when he raised his head.

When Lin Yun pointed his finger, a massive azure dragon flew out, turning into a dazzling sword ray. His Heavenly Dome Sword Intent at complete mastery, soared to the sky as a light pillar. As heaven shattered, Lin Yun executed the Flicking Divine Finger.
