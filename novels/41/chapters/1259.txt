Chapter 1260 - Fearless!

The Empyreans who gathered together were dumbfounded. After all, that was a core disciple of the Azure Thunder Sect, and Lin Yun killed her without any hesitation. As for those bolder guys, they were the first to recover from their shock and landed behind Lin Yun, before sweeping all the herbs around the Scarlet Blood Fruit. Those herbs had basked in the Scarlet Blood Fruit’s vitality, so the value was naturally a lot higher than those they had previously acquired. It impossible to conceal the joy on their faces.

Lin Yun looked at the Scarlet Blood Fruit in his hand and didn’t even take a look at the woman’s corpse. His eyes were flickering and were in deep thoughts. The value of this Scarlet Blood Fruit was a lot higher than all the herbs he had previously acquired.

This made him realize that he might be on the wrong path. After all, quality was better than quantity. He shouldn’t have wasted his time on those trinkets like the vermillion fruit since it was a futile effort, even if he gathered a lot of them.

“Brother, leave quickly. When the Azure Thunder Sect’s disciples are back, they might come and deal with you. It’s dangerous for you to stay here,” said someone.

“Where are they?” Lin Yun asked after storing the Scarlet Blood Fruit. He was curious as to why the woman was alone on this so-called “forbidden island”. Although she had the saint sword and was enough to deal with most people, he heard that there were ten-odd disciples who came from the Azure Thunder Sect.

“They’re at the bottom of the sea. There are also many opportunities beneath the sea. Many demonic beasts and herbs have mutated. So you’ll be in trouble once they return.”

“You think I’m afraid of them?” Lin Yun asked. His words instantly left everyone dumbfounded. After all, the woman died such a miserable death even when she had a saint sword. They didn’t think that the other disciples could do anything to Lin Yun even if they came back.

“But you have a sect behind you, and they might come after your sect,” said another person. After all, the Azure Thunder Sect definitely could do such a thing.

Find my sect? Lin Yun smiled because if they do so, it would be the same as courting death. Not to mention Jiang Lichen and the rest who have refined a decent amount of divine dragon aura. They weren’t any weaker than Sword Sect’s disciples, not to mention that there was still Ye Ziling and Luo Hua around. Just Ye Ziling alone, Lin Yun could no longer see through her.

He sensed that she had awakened her Snow Radiant Bloodline, and that wasn’t the only difference about her. Even her attainment in the sword had greatly improved. Although Lin Yun could see through some with her divine firmament sword intent, he still couldn’t completely see through her.

As for Luo Hua, there was naturally nothing to say about her. She was someone that even a Dragon Pulse Realm expert couldn’t do anything against, and even Lin Yun wouldn’t go after them. In terms of background, there was naturally nothing to compete with. Ye Ziling was the direct descendant of an Ancient Saint Clan and could completely suppress the Azure Thunder Sect.

Seeing that Lin Yun wasn’t worried at all, someone unhappily said, “The Azure Thunder Sect’s main sect is occupying another island. This place doesn’t have many experts, and I heard that Dugu Yun is over there. Dugu Yun is someone capable of competing with the strongest geniuses on the Empyrean Ranking!”

“Dugu Yun is invincible with a sword. If he enters the Profound Wither Island, you’ll probably be in trouble when targeted by him.”

Lin Yun was calm and said, “Invincible with a sword? How boastful.”

Everyone was shocked when they heard that and looked at Lin Yun with shock. They began to wonder who Lin Yun was for him to not even fear Dugu Yun.

“Let’s talk about this again on the Profound Wither Island.” Lin Yun wasn’t arrogant, but disdainful of those who use the title ‘invincible with a sword’. Even he didn’t dare to boast that he was invincible among the Empyrean Realm in sword technique, so he didn’t know where Dugu Yun got the face to say that.

“Do you guys know where I can find saint elixirs?” Lin Yun asked. He had lost his interest in the other thousand-year-old elixirs. Since he was going on a hunt, he might as well go for saint elixirs. Even something with the lowest grade would be equivalent to hundreds of thousand-year-old elixirs.

This made everyone take in a cold breath with their faces changed. Lin Yun was a little too arrogant in their eyes.

“Saint elixirs can only be found on the islands controlled by those powerful sects. The moment a saint elixir appears, the other powerful sects will also participate in the competition.”

“Saint elixirs are best for Dragon Pulse Realm experts, and they could completely refine the saint elixirs. So those who go after the saint elixirs will definitely have a Dragon Pulse Realm expert behind them. After all, it is impossible to obtain the saint elixirs by themselves.”

“It’s mainly because they’re too rare. So far, only seven saint elixirs have appeared, and they’re all low-grade.” They explained to Lin Yun, persuading him not to compete for them. After all, the competition behind every saint elixir had a Dragon Pulse Realm expert behind them.

Lin Yun fell into thoughts because he knew how tough it would be since the powerful sects of the Ancient Barren Domain weren’t pushovers. He had seen the Sword Sect’s formation, and just seeing the formation alone was enough to make his scalp go numb.

“Hehe. Young Master Lin, the saint elixirs aren’t easy to obtain, but you can go after quasi-saint elixirs. They’re also the main objective of those geniuses.”

“That’s right. Saint elixirs are hard to refine, and only those extraordinary geniuses in the Elysium Core Realm could barely refine them. But quasi-saint elixirs are different, and it won’t be a problem for you to refine them with your physique.” The bolder ones who have been following behind Lin Yun gave him a suggestion.

Quasi-saint elixirs were between saint elixirs and spiritual elixirs. The Scarlet Blood Fruit in his hand might be precious, but it was still a spiritual elixir and couldn’t be considered as a quasi-saint elixir. That also made sense because even if he managed to obtain a saint elixir, he wouldn’t be able to refine it.

It was only possible after he manifested his constellation, but behind every saint elixir was a Dragon Pulse Realm expert. He could also wait till he reaches the Elysium Core Realm and use the saint elixir as a resource to imprint the saint elixir to his core.

“Where can I find them?” Lin Yun asked.

“Quasi-saint elixirs are rare, but their birth will be accompanied by a phenomenon. The big sects’ disciples will join hands to expel everyone else.”

“If you need, we can help you look around and let you know if there are any quasi-saint elixirs.”

“With your strength, you can try and compete for those quasi-saint elixirs.” They were excited and even offered to help Lin Yun. After all, the elixirs found around quasi-saint elixirs were extremely precious, and this was why they were inciting Lin Yun to go.

Lin Yun naturally knew what they were planning, but he also needed their help because he didn’t want to waste time looking for quasi-saint elixirs.

“Go ahead. I only want quasi-saint elixirs,” said Lin Yun.

“We’ll go immediately.” Everyone became excited because they didn’t believe that Lin Yun could sweep through the disciples of the big sects.

Lin Yun took out a Scarlet Blood Fruit and planned on refining it on the spot, intending to reach a thousand dragon runes before the Profound Wither Island opens. As he circulated the Azure Dragon Saint Art, he began to glow with his vitality surging within his body and even emitted a draconic roar.

It didn’t take long for this entire region to be lit up with lightning and wind gathering around. This made everyone shocked.

“Isn’t he a little too arrogant? Isn’t he afraid that the Azure Thunder Sect’s disciples will return?”

“That woman’s blood hasn’t even dried. If the Azure Thunder Sect’s disciples return, they’ll surely be angered to death.”

“Just what body-refining technique is that? It feels a little too unbelievable.”

“That guy is very mysterious, and he shouldn’t be nameless.” The phenomenon Lin Yun caused was so terrifying that everyone exclaimed in admiration. They were all shocked by Lin Yun’s courage to refine the Scarlet Blood Fruit on the spot and not leave.

Although the Scarlet Blood Fruit wasn’t ordinary, it was still lacking when compared to divine dragon aura. When the Azure Dragon Saint Art completely refined it, he barely reached eight hundred runes.

“Don’t be fooled by those people. They just want to see you die.”

“Those who compete for quasi-saint elixirs are all disciples of big sects. They’re at least in the three thousandths on the Empyrean Ranking.”

“The competition behind each saint elixir has the silhouette of a Dragon Pulse Realm expert. So this makes the competition for quasi-saint elixirs even more intense.” After the bolder ones left, some kindhearted cultivator stepped forth to persuade Lin Yun.

Lin Yun was strong, decisive, and confident. So many people were won over by his performance. They didn’t want to see him lose his life in this manner.

“Thank you for all your goodwill, but I’m fearless,” smiled Lin Yun. Just his words showed his strong confidence, which made everyone speechless. In the end, they could only shake their heads. They could only say that Lin Yun was too naive, wanting to compete for a quasi-saint elixir all by himself with only a sword.

Even if Lin Yun had a strong physique, he was only at the Galaxy Stage. So he would suffer if he ran into quasi-Elysium Core Realm experts. Those bolder ones only wanted to fish for benefits behind Lin Yun, so they sucked up to Lin Yun in the best way they could. In the end, they felt that Lin Yun was too young to be so impudent after receiving some praise.

“Still a little lacking. This spiritual elixir isn’t enough.” Lin Yun opened his eyes. If someone heard what he said, they would definitely throw out blood. After all, when Lin Yun refined the Scarlet Blood Fruit, the entire sky was filled with crimson light and the aura emitted from the Scarlet Blood Fruit was unbelievably dense. But Lin Yun actually held it in such low regard.

When Lin Yun raised his head, those who went to look for quasi-saint elixirs still showed no signs of returning.

“I might as well use these to make a pot of seafood…” Lin Yun pondered and took out a huge pot before he got Lil’ Red to gather some dried tree branches and fishes along the way.

“What is he trying to do?” Everyone was baffled while looking at Lin Yun’s actions. But when the pot began to boil, Lin Yun started throwing elixirs into the pot. Seeing all the spiritual elixirs thrown into the pot and casually cooked by Lin Yun, everyone was so shocked that their jaws dropped to the ground because this was a little too wasteful, in their opinion.FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m
