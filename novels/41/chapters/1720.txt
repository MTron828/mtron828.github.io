Chapter 1721 – Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain

On the other hand, the West Garden Banquet ended in a mess in the Liu Saint Clan. All the guests left, and only members of the Liu Saint Clan remained.

“Patriarch, how can Mu Xueling possibly possess the Imperial Dragon Order? This makes no sense…” A Saint Realm elder said. Everyone else was also shocked and had yet to recover from their shock; their eyes were also filled with disbelief. But all of their gazes were on Saint Liu.

Saint Liu’s brows were locked together because he was baffled by what had happened today. The shock he felt was more significant than anyone else when he saw the Imperial Dragon Order. Since he had the qualifications to request an audience with the Empress, he knew what it meant. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Seeing the Imperial Dragon Order was the same as seeing the Empress herself. With the Imperial Dragon Order, Mu Xueling possessed the authority to determine the life and death of anyone loyal to the Divine Dragon Empire. Most importantly, there was only one Imperial Dragon Order in the Kunlun Realm!

According to his understanding, the Imperial Dragon Order didn’t only signify the Empress, but it could also open various treasuries of the Divine Dragon Empire. To a certain degree, it was equivalent to the seal of an empire in ancient times.

“Something is weird about this.” Saint Liu sighed.

“Jiang Yu said that Mu Xueling came from the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain, and she’s not from the saint city.” The Wind Edge Lord suddenly said.

“The Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain?” Saint Liu squinted his eyes. He said, “She’s not possibly related to the Blue Dragon Record, right?”

“The Blue Dragon Record?” Everyone, including the Wind Edge Lord, had confusion on their faces.

Stroking his beard, Saint Liu explained, “There has always been a rumor. No one in the Divine Dragon Empire, including the Empress, is in control of this divine artifact, albeit to be in the hands of the Divine Dragon Empire. There are rumors that the Blue Dragon Record was something that the Nine Emperors obtained after paying a visit to the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain. But to fully activate the Blue Dragon Record, it requires a designated time and a designated person!”

The Wind Edge Lord’s face changed when he heard that, and he asked, “Father, you’re not trying to say that Mu Xueling came down from the divine mountain to activate the Blue Dragon Record, right?”

But Saint Liu fell into a long silence before he said, “This is only a speculation. I’ll personally make a trip to the Divine Dragon Empire. For the time being, don’t touch the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion. You guys can leave first.”

“Yes.” Everyone said before leaving.

The Wind Edge Lord walked around the Liu Saint Clan before he came to a hovering palace. This was his private residence, and there were already four people waiting for him. They were Huang Xuanyi, Kong Ying, Xiahou Feng, and Xin Wuhen. They were the only ones that caught the Wind Edge Lord’s attention amongst the guests.

After simple treatment, Huang Xuanyi had a white cloth wrapped around his eyes.

“Brother Huang, I’m responsible for this, and I will surely find a way to treat your eyes. I believe that I can find Blue Dragon Saliva in the Heavenly Domain City.” The Wind Edge Lord said, stepping forth.

Huang Xuanyi smiled, and he replied, “There’s no need to hurry. On the contrary, I benefited from being blinded instead. When I was previously blinded, I reached the seventh stage in the Light Destruction Divine Art, so it’s a fortune in disguise. This time, I can use this opportunity to reach the ninth stage in one go. To someone in the Dragon Pulse Realm, being unable to see isn’t something significant.”

The Wind Edge Lord was stunned because he never expected Huang Xuanyi to be so optimistic, which was surprising.

Right then, Kong Ying asked, “Wind Edge Lord, what’s the origin of that Lin Xiao? Isn’t it too bizarre for someone like him to suddenly appear in the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion? His music dao might be strong, but the feeling he gave me doesn’t seem like a musician.”

“That’s right. His Saint Tone is crude, and the outcome will be uncertain if we continued to compete in music dao. Thinking about it now, we were too anxious before. He should be more proficient in martial dao.” Xiahou Feng added.

“A swordsman.” Xin Wuhen said without raising his head and toyed with his flute.

“What swordsman?” Everyone was startled and turned their gazes over.

Raising his head, Xin Wuhen explained, “The feel that he gave me is more like a swordsman. Coincidentally, his surname is Lin, he possesses the Azure Dragon Saint Physique, and he’s similarly arrogant. Doesn’t that make you think of someone?”

Lin Yun instantly crossed everyone’s minds when they heard what Xin Wuhen said, and they were shocked. That was the same for the Wind Edge Lord. After all, Flower Burial was a name of legend, and there wasn’t a person in the Kunlun Realm who hadn’t heard of his name. When he appeared, he was like a rising star, spreading his name throughout the Kunlun Realm.

“That’s impossible.” Huang Xuanyi rejected that speculation. “I fought with Lin Yun before, and I’m well-aware of his martial techniques. I can’t see any traces of Lin Yun's martial techniques on Lin Xiao. As for the Azure Dragon Saint Physique, it’s normal that multiple people in the Kunlun Realm possess it, despite being rare.”

Then again, he still had something he didn’t say. He refused to believe that Lin Yun could defeat him without using his sword.

Lin Yun was a true genius of the Sword Sect, and his sword technique was breathtaking, with no one capable of rivaling him in the entire Ancient Barren Domain amongst the younger generation. Although his other means were also top-tiered, they weren’t as heaven-defying as his sword dao.

When they previously fought, Huang Xuanyi lost to Lin Yun's sword. So how could Huang Xuanyi believe that Lin Yun could now defeat him without using his sword? That would make him feel even more terrible than him being killed.

The Wind Edge Lord nodded his head. What Huang Xuanyi said made sense. The Azure Dragon Saint Physique might be rare, but that didn’t mean that no one else in the Kunlun Realm possessed it. At the very least, he knew at least three people in the Eastern Desolation who possessed the Azure Dragon Saint Physique. As for the Divine Dragon Empire or other ancient domains, there would only be even more people. So the Azure Dragon Saint Physique didn’t mean anything.

He said, “This person has no relationship with Lin Yun, and the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion already conducted a check on him with the Heavenly Origin Mirror. The Heavenly Origin Mirror can see through all disguises and illusions, so not even a saint can hide from it. There’s no way he can be Lin Yun.”

Nodding his head, Kong Ying replied, “That makes sense. Not to mention that he also won’t have the guts to appear in public.”

“The Blood Moon Sect’s recent competition with the Demon Gate has been intense within the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea. There might be some commotion in the Black Tortoise Void Sea. So we can put the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s matters aside, for now. Wind Edge Lord, what do you think?” Huang Xuanyi said.

“I happen to share the same thoughts. The appearance of the Imperial Dragon Order is too weird, so there’s no need for us to continue provoking the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion. I heard a female Venerable appeared in the Demon Gate, and her means are terrifying. The Demon Gate has been suppressed by the Blood Moon Sect all along in the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea, and yet she practically turned the tables around.” The Wind Edge Lord smiled.

“The Black Tortoise Void Sea is truly weird. I heard that the Blood Moon Sect might dispatch a holy son over.” Kong Ying and others fell into deep thoughts because there were rumors that the Black Tortoise Void Sea was related to the Black Tortoise’s inheritance.

In ancient times, an ancient sect once fell within the Black Tortoise Void Sea, and pieces of treasures could also be found there. But none of them were of great value. They paled in comparison to the dangers in that region.

“If that’s really the case, this might be an opportunity for Wind Edge Lord. I bet it’ll be bustling with many Dragon Pulse Realm geniuses gathered at that time. The six holy lands might also be attracted to it.” Kong Ying said. He had a good relationship with the Wind Edge Lord and knew that the latter was planning something big, holding a strong obsession to be first on the Dragon Pulse Ranking.

As flames blazed within the Wind Edge Lord’s pupils, he smiled, “Jian Jingtian had been occupying the first on the Dragon Pulse Ranking for so many years. Now that he has taken a step forth, it’s time for this position to be determined.”

Ever since Jian Jingtian made a breakthrough and became a King, the first of the Dragon Pulse Ranking kept changing because no one could sit firmly on it like Jian Jingtian. Being first on the rankings didn’t only mean reputation, the rankings were Sovereign Saint Artifacts.

They could be considered a weakened version of the Blue Dragon Record, and those with their names recorded on it would obtain benefits. Although the Dragon Pulse Ranking was in chaos, everyone was qualified to compete. It was making preparations and waiting for an opportunity for all the Dragon Pulse Ranking’s geniuses to gather.

The moment the opportunity came, and one managed to suppress all the Dragon Pulse Ranking’s geniuses; they would be able to firmly sit as first on the ranking. At that time, the Dragon Pulse Ranking wouldn’t be as chaotic as before and kept changing.

“That’s decided, then.” The Wind Edge Lord smiled. “You guys can stay in the Liu Saint Clan for the time being and make preparations so that we can obtain the initiative at that time.”
