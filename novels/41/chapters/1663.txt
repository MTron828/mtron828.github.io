Chapter 1664 – I'm The Sole Immortal! (1)

When the Radiant Sword Saint shook his wrist, thirty-six afterimages appeared from him, and each of the afterimages swung a sword. The sword rays were like ink that contained the law of this world.

“Ha!” Tian Xuanzi’s eyes flashed with a cold light, and he said, “As expected of the Radiant Sword Saint, to look down on this junior and not use the Great Profound Sword Canon.”

As he spoke, he summoned a sword, and the portrait behind him manifested into a universe. Each star in the portrait shone brightly, forming a colossal being in the universe.

“Divine Starry Sword—Shattering Sky!” A cold light flashed within Tian Xuanzi’s pupils as he swung his sword.

The colossal being in the portrait also swung a sword, and a sword ray flew out from the portrait that overlapped with the sword ray unleashed by Tian Xuanzi. Before the ancient ‘Heaven’ word could descend, it was severed into two by Tian Xuanzi’s attack.

“Radiant, you’ve become old.” Tian Xuanzi said indifferently and shook his head. “That isn’t how you use the sword. Divine Starry Sword—Void Annihilation!”

As countless stars exploded in the universe that was contained in the portrait, the fragments of the exploded stars fused into primal chaos that looked like a void after the universe was destroyed. When the primal chaos unleashed a terrifying destructive aura, Tian Xuanzi soared to the sky, and swung his sword.

A sword ray suddenly lit up the primal chaos, and the power of that sword ray reached an unbelievable height.

Tia Xuanzi also smiled with fighting spirits blazing in his pupils. But his face drastically changed when he saw the Radiant Sword Saint through the ancient ‘Heaven’ word fragments.

Behind Tian Xuanzi, the thirty-six afterimages multiplied by thirty-six, waving their swords, unleashing one ancient ‘Heaven’ word after another. The ‘Heaven’ that Tian Xuanzi destroyed earlier was just the tip of the iceberg.

At the very least, hundreds to thousands of ancient ‘Heaven’ flew over from various directions. But what was more terrifying was that each ‘Heaven’ contained a different intent.

All of the Radiant Sword Saint’s comprehension of the sword for the past millennium had manifested into ‘carefree’ and were executed by the ancient ‘Heaven’ words.

The attack unleashed by Tian Xuanzi swiftly shattered, and Tian Xuanzi could only keep waving his sword to destroy the incoming ‘Heaven’ words. But the number of ‘Heaven’ words was endless, and the intent in each one of them was different. Every time he destroyed one ‘Heaven’ word, he would have to search for the flaw in the next one.

Tian Xuanzi was strong and destroyed hundreds of ‘Heaven’ words. But when he destroyed the eight hundredth one, Tian Xuanzi finally became powerless and was struck by the incoming ‘Heaven’ words.

Thus, countless ‘Heaven’ words were like hammers slamming into Tian Xuanzi. When the latter flew back, he threw out three mouthfuls of blood.

“Lin Yun, do you understand now?” The Radiant Sword Saint said as his white robe and long hair fluttered in the wind.

“Disciple understood!” Lin Yun yelled with excitement filling his pupils.

“Hahaha, why aren’t you thanking the Profound Sky Great Saint for experiencing the sword head-on for you to comprehend?” The Radiant Sword Saint laughed and shook his wrist again, “This time, it’ll be the Earth Sword Form!”

“Thank you, Profound Sky Great Saint!” Lin Yun yelled.

Tian Xuanzi threw out a mouthful of blood and turned around to glare at Lin Yun. But he couldn’t be bothered with Lin Yun now because the Radiant Sword Saint’s second attack had arrived.

Meanwhile, the spectators were briefly stunned by what was happening before they came to their senses. The Radiant Sword Saint was using Tian Xuanzi as a teaching guide for Lin Yun, and he didn’t place Tian Xuanzi in his eyes at all.

It didn’t take long for the Radiant Sword Saint to unleash the Heaven, Earth, Profound, and Desolate Sword Forms. Facing the Radiant Sword Saint’s attacks, Tian Xuanzi couldn’t put up any resistance. When the Radiant Sword Saint unleashed the Desolate Sword Form, the sword in Tian Xuanzi’s hand was knocked away with a sword vibratoin.

“Good sword!” The Radiant Sword Saint didn’t care about the shocked Tian Xuanzi, and praised while looking at the Flower Burial Sword in his hand.

The Flower Burial Sword also responded as though it had heard the Radiant Sword Saint’s praises and vibrated as a response.

“H-How is this possible…” Tian Xuanzi was utterly dumbfounded, with shock filling his pupils. This was because he was horrified to discover that the Radiant Sword Saint didn’t use his true strength and merely used the strength of an ordinary Great Saint. The Radiant Sword Saint didn’t even use his sword dao or the ultimate technique of the Sword Sect, the Great Profound Sword Canon.

They were both Great Saints, but the gap between them was more significant than Tian Xuanzi could imagine. Could this be the true strength of a Great Saint?

Tian Xuanzi’s eyes flickered, and the confidence he had before was shattered. The Radiant Sword Saint completely suppressed his aura. But even so, Tian Xuanzi didn’t suffer any severe injuries.

Tian Xuanzi was still in an invisible portrait, looking like he didn’t exist in this world. He was clearly present here, but he gave off a feeling that he didn’t blend into the surroundings.

As the Radiant Sword Saint and Tian Xuanzi continued to fight, Tian Xuanzi could only block, but his aura didn’t crumble.

“Who said that the Radiant Sword Saint has become old and could no longer put up a fight? It appears that the rumors were untrue. The Radiant Sword Saint is still the Radiant Sword Saint. I was impulsive, but how long can you keep this up?” Tian Xuanzi squinted his eyes and wiped the blood off his lips.

He had finally noticed something. The Radiant Sword Saint couldn’t leave the Sword Sect for long. He would die if the Radiant Sword Saint left the Sword Sect for too long.

Tian Xuanzi could afford to lose, but the Radiant Sword Saint couldn’t once he was forced to leave the Sword Sect. He had already won.

It would be great if he could defeat the Radiant Sword Saint. But he just had to buy some time and wait if he couldn't. Furthermore, this wasn’t all Tian Xuanzi had prepared to face the Radiant Sword Saint.

“You think I can’t grab you just because you’re hiding in a portrait?” The Radiant Sword Saint’s eyes flashed with indifference. “Lin Yun, look well. These are the following four sword forms of the Carefree 9 Swords.”

When the Radiant Sword Saint swung his sword, a terrifying hurricane swept out from the sword, distorting space, shattering the sky, and cutting all the spiritual energy in the surroundings and all the phenomena.

I have a sword, wind, like a violent tornado that can annihilate all life.

Slicing apart the sky with one sword, the portrait before Tian Xuanzi was torn to pieces, and Tian Xuanzi could only use his sword to fend against the Radiant Sword Saint’s attack. But even so, he was still sent flying away.

Spreading his arms apart, Tian Xuanzi swiftly formed seals in mid-air, wanting to gather the portrait together. At this moment, everyone finally saw the true Tian Xuanzi, and his presence felt real.
