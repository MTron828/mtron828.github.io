Chapter 834 - Final Battle

The azure dragon looked more vivid after being empowered by Lin Yun’s quasi-spiritual sword intent. It even unleashed an unprecedented dragon aura with dazzling flames flickering in its eyes. The sky was bright tonight because of Lin Yun’s quasi-spiritual sword intent. This caused shock throughout the surroundings as everyone looked at Lin Yun with disbelief.

“Quasi-spiritual sword intent. So it turns out that Lin Yun’s sword intent was this strong!”

“His sword intent seems to be stronger than Mu Han’s sword intent. There’s no way the two can be compared. Just how did Lin Yun manage to do it?”

“Just how many trump cards does he have?” Exclamations came from the surroundings as Lin Yun suddenly came to a stop. Using his quasi-spiritual sword intent to control the aura of his Overlord Sword, Lin Yun raised his hand and faced Zhao Wuji’s blade head-on.

In a split second, Zhao Wuji’s attack crumbled along with the phenomenon he created. But that wasn’t all as the Azure Dragon Sword Aura around Lin Yun continued to charge forward to destroy the lightning around Zhao Wuji.

“How is this possible?!” cried Zhao Wuji. Lin Yun not only destroyed his attack, but Lin Yun also devoured his remaining power. No one could imagine how much power Lin Yun’s sword intent needed to accomplish such a feat.

The faces of everyone from the Violet Thunder Sect changed. They knew exactly how strong Zhao Wuji’s attack was.

“We still have a chance. Wuji will be the last one standing,” said the Violet Thunder Sect’s sect master. He had placed all his hopes on Zhao Wuji, so there was no way he could accept Zhao Wuji losing to an underdog.

Zhao Wuji flashed and retreated, brandishing his blade several times to fend off Lin Yun’s attack.

“So what if you have the quasi-spiritual sword intent? Let me see what other trump cards you have!” At this moment, Zhao Wuji’s face became twisted. He didn’t want to be defeated by Lin Yun. Even Yu Haotian had to pay a price to defeat him, not to mention Lin Yun.

“Thundercloud Star Shatter!” Zhao Wuji roared and the thunderclouds in the sky began to swirl once more. This time, he pushed his saber intent to the limit. When he slashed down with his saber, the entire sky was nearly split in two.

“How annoying!” Lin Yun held onto his sword as it began to flicker brightly under his quasi-spiritual sword intent. The aura of his Overlord Sword began to spread out like fireflies that turned into a golden ocean of clouds.

A golden brilliance blazed behind him while his sword shined brightly. When his sword clashed with Zhao Wuji’s blade, golden radiance exploded and destroyed Zhao Wuji’s attack. This made Zhao Wuji throw up a mouthful of blood as he took several steps backwards.

His eyes were filled with disbelief. He couldn’t believe that he was defeated by Lin Yun in a head-on encounter. Not only was his strength suppressed, the intent in their attacks weren’t even on the same level.

After pushing Zhao Wuji back, Lin Yun held onto his sword and swung it out, unleashing the Overlord Sword—Tai’a Slash.

When the sword ray connected, a terrifying wound appeared on Zhao Wuji’s chest as his blood splattered out. If he was slow to retreat, he would have been split in half.

Lin Yun stomped his foot on the ground and soared into the sky. Holding onto his sword, his long hair fluttered wildly in the wind. Empowered by his quasi-spiritual sword intent, the moon radiated brightly on Lin Yun’s face as his clothes and hair were dyed silver.

“You lost,” said Lin Yun calmly. Zhao Wuji was strong, especially his thundercloud intent. However, it was meaningless once Lin Yun brought out his quasi-spiritual sword intent.

Perhaps it was due to Mu Han’s quasi-spiritual sword that Zhao Wuji thought he could defeat Lin Yun.

However, there was no way Mu Han could be compared to Lin Yun. After all, Lin Yun didn’t waste his time tempering his sword intent in the beast tide. At that time, his quasi-spiritual sword intent could already last for an entire night without extinguishing, not to mention he also had the Azure Dragon Sword Aura. How could Mu Han and Lin Yun possibly be the same?

“Impossible! It won’t be simple for you to win!” Zhao Wuji’s face became sinister. Even if he was going to lose, he had to make Lin Yun pay a price. There was no way he could allow his opponent to win so easily.

“Great Thundercloud Explosion!” Zhao Wuji had always been a decisive person. He would never waver once he made up his mind, not to mention that it wasn’t certain yet that he would lose. Along with his roar, nine majestic vortexes appeared in the sky that began to merge once more.

In the next second, a gigantic vortex was formed with an enormous bolt of lightning in the middle.

“How stubborn!” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with indifference. The gap between them wasn’t something that an ultimate attack could cover. If Zhao Wuji couldn’t make a breakthrough with his thundercloud intent, no ultimate move could pose a single threat to Lin Yun. Plus, Lin Yun didn’t have to fear any ultimate move with his Overlord Sword.

Supreme Dominance!

With a single thought, Lin Yun combined the Thunderbolt Slash, Breaking Dawn, and Tai’a Slash before swinging his sword down. As his sword ray flashed, the round moon beneath his foot exploded with countless mirror-like fragments hovering in the sky.

The terrifying looking thundercloud vortex was instantly cut in half by Lin Yun. Then, Lin Yun pushed his movement technique to the limit as his sword rays interlocked. The remaining thundercloud vortex was then split into tens of thousands of pieces.

Zhao Wuji’s eyes were filled with disbelief as a sword ray pierced through the vortex and began to expand in his pupils.

With a gentle flick of his sword, Lin Yun sent Zhao Wuji’s blade flying. He then sheathed his sword and said, “Zhao Wuji, you lost.”

At the same time, he waved his right hand and all the swords hovering in the sky returned back to their owners. From afar, it looked like gorgeous fireworks were going off behind Lin Yun.

When Zhao Wuji saw this scene, he became discouraged before he sighed, “You won.”

In the next second, the Five-clawed Golden Dragon behind Zhao Wuji crumbled as its profound amber aura flowed out. Then, Lin Yun’s dragon projection began to devour the profound amber aura violently. But because of how massive the profound amber aura was, Lin Yun’s dragon projection spent a long time devouring the profound amber aura.

“You really are a monster,” said Zhao Wuji, feeling reluctant about his loss to Lin Yun. “But it doesn’t matter. No matter how dazzling you are, you’ll still be harvested like wheat by Yu Haotian. It’s uncertain if you can even protect your life.” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“At least I still have a chance, unlike you. No need to worry about me,” said Lin Yun.

Hearing Lin Yun’s mockery, Zhao Wuji didn’t get angry. Instead, he calmly replied, “The Overlord Sword and Overlord Fist have the same origin as part of the Sword Sect’s Heavenly Earth Overlord Art. If I’m right, Yu Haotian must’ve cultivated that section of the cultivation technique. His Overlord Fist is a lot more complete than your Overlord Sword. You’ll know the gap between you two once you fight.”

Heavenly Earth Overlord Art? Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts. Lord Thirteen and the previous pavilion master had told him about it. However, he never thought it would be in the hands of the Indigomoon Elysium.

Seeing Lin Yun fall into deep thoughts, Zhao Wuji smiled, “Looks like you still have a few more trump cards. However, even that’s futile because there’s only one possible outcome.”

“Don’t be so sure about that,” said Lin Yun. Then, after devouring Zhao Wuji’s profound amber aura, he left.

The light of dawn broke through the clouds as morning arrived. With the battle for the top ten coming to an end, only four more battles were left. Lin Yun VS Zhu Qingshan, Yu Haotian VS Zhao Wuji, Jiang Ziye VS Wu Xiaotian, and Lin Yun VS Yu Haotian.

There was no suspense in Jiang Ziye’s fight with Wu Xiaotian. Jiang Ziye easily obtained the victory. After half an hour of rest, Lin Yun and Zhu Qingshan fought on the stage.

Because Lin Yun would be facing Yu Haotian after the fight, he didn’t waste any time. He immediately brought out his quasi-spiritual sword intent and unleashed Supreme Dominance with six forms combined.

A boundless sword ray was unleashed from the Flower Burial Sword, catching Zhu Qingshan by surprise even though he was prepared. He tried his best to avoid the attack, but Lin Yun’s sword was simply too fast for him. He was only able to avoid half of it before the remaining sword ray destroyed the demonic aura around him.

Vomiting up blood, Zhu Qingshan tried to move his fingers. However, he realized that he had been immobilized by the quasi-spiritual sword intent, so he was forced to admit defeat. As for the battle between Yu Haotian and Zhao Wuji, Zhao Wuji instantly surrendered because he was discouraged from his battle with Lin Yun. Finally, the battle between Lin Yun and Yu Haotian had arrived.
