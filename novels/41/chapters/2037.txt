Chapter 2038 - Final Trial (2)

“Where’s the sword ray?” Lin Yun looked around and couldn’t see the dao flame or the Nine-Colored Heavenly Cloud Fruit anywhere. The dao flame was manifested by the sword ray left behind by the Emperor Sword.

“That’s the dao flame,” the bearded youth stepped forth and pointed at the sun that was before them.

“The sun?” Lin Yun turned to look at the sun that the bearded youth pointed out.

“That’s right. Are you shocked? I was as shocked as you when I first saw it,” the bearded youth smiled.

“I’m not shocked at all,” Lin Yun replied. “As long as you achieve the Astral Sword Intent, you can condense the flame of stars as your sword intent. The so-called ‘dao flame’ is just the Astral Sword Intent reaching the peak.”

Lin Yun raised his head and gradually noticed some things. There were galaxies around the ‘sun,’ and each galaxy reached over a few thousand feet or even ten thousand feet.

The galaxies shone with starlight, but the ‘sun’ was too dazzling, making those stars seem dim.

“You…” The bearded youth was left speechless by Ye Qingtian.

“You’re not a swordsman, right? Who the hell are you?” Lin Yun asked.

“You don’t know who I am?” The bearded youth smiled.

“I previously guessed that you might be the successor of the Heavenly Sword or Dao Sword. But I’m sure that you’re not a swordsman now. So I can’t guess who you are,” Lin Yun said.

“I’m not familiar with those two. But how did you confirm that I’m not a swordsman?” the bearded youth asked.

“If you’re a swordsman, you wouldn’t have said what you said earlier. Even if you’re a swordsman, you didn’t grasp the Astral Sword Intent, but that doesn’t make a difference to me,” Lin Yun said.

The bearded youth was teased by what Lin Yun said and smiled, “Ye Qingtian, it looks like you’re really cocky as rumored.”

He could tell that Ye Qingtian was mocking him for being unable to discover the dao flame's profundity. Furthermore, Ye Qingtian had a deeper meaning in his words. He was also saying that a swordsman who didn’t grasp the Astral Sword Intent couldn’t be considered a genuine swordsman in his eyes.

“You’re…” Lin Yun ignored what the bearded youth said and continued speculating about his identity, but he stopped halfway. Since Lin Yun had rested for long enough, he prepared to challenge the last trial. He said, “Forget about it. It doesn’t matter to me who you are. You can step aside now. I’m going to challenge the trial now.”

“Hey, do you even know where the last trial is?” The bearded youth said unhappily. He wanted to tell Ye Qingtian his identity and shock the latter, but he never expected that Ye Qingtian would suddenly stop guessing and was no longer interested in his identity.

“Of course, I know where the last trial is at. Otherwise, why would I tell you to move out of the way?” Lin Yun pushed his palm forth, seeing that the bearded youth wouldn’t move out of the way. When he pushed his palm forth, a dense mist began to gush out of his palm.

It felt like Lin Yun had touched a cauldron, causing a sizzling sound from his palm. Lin Yun quickly retracted his palm from the scorching pain.Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Lin Yun’s hands swiftly became red, but his injuries swiftly recovered under the nourishment of the Blue Dragon Divine Bone.

“You’re really bold. You would've been reduced to ashes if it was someone else who dared to touch me this way. Forget about it, I won’t hold it against you anymore. You can go ahead and challenge the trial,” the bearded youth smiled and jumped back, retreating to a few hundred meters away.

The bearded youth blinked and looked at Ye Qingtian. He was curious if Ye Qingtian really found the entrance to the last trial. After all, he spent so much effort to come this far in the past before knowing what the final trial was.

Lin Yun sat down and circulated the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron with his body filled in the dragon-phoenix sword aura. At the same time, his Astral Sword Intent began to blaze on his forehead.

When Lin Yun released the Astral Sword Intent, Lin Yun began to release sword rays around him, unleashing a radiance that was not inferior to the dao flame. As the two sword intents clashed, the sky suddenly became dark, with only two light sources shining brightly.

One was in the sky, while the other was at the mountain’s summit. Only dim lights were released from the stars in the sky, while everywhere else was pitch-black.

This was the actual scenery because the sky was supposed to be dark, but the dao flame lit up the sky. Lin Yun briefly observed the dao flame and guessed the final trial. This disrupted the dao flame’s radiance from enveloping the entire sky. When the two sword intents reached the peak, Lin Yun flicked his finger, and the Flower Burial Sword flew out.

A figure walked out from the dao flame, looking like a deity walking out of the sun, wielding a saint sword.

Lin Yun manipulated the sword from afar, using his Flower Burial Sword to face his opponent. When their sword rays clashed, the surroundings suddenly alternated between light and dark.

Seeing this, the bearded youth sighed and nodded, “It looks like a genius swordsman has appeared in the sect.”

After they clashed for a thousand moves, Lin Yun soared to the sky and grabbed the Flower Burial Sword, executing Light of the Beginning. Primal chaos exploded and was split as the sword ray flashed and cut that figure into two.

The dao flame was like a sun descending from the sky, with the sky suddenly becoming dark. When the sun lost its radiance, a nine-colored radiance appeared at the far end. The moment it appeared, a man stood on the sword that flew over.

The bearded youth blinked as Lin Yun returned to the summit with the Nine-Colored Heavenly Cloud Fruit. When Lin Yun landed on the summit, he examined the Heavenly Cloud Fruit in his hand and gradually sheathed the Flower Burial Sword. “With this fruit, my Astral Sword Intent should be able to smoothly reach greater mastery.”

“You’re really fast. I was just distracted for a moment back then, and the fruit disappeared,” the bearded youth said, looking at the Nine-Colored Heavenly Cloud Fruit in Lin Yun’s hands. Right then, an indigo streak of light soared through the sky and landed on the summit. This indigo streak of light was the Crane Fairy.

“Ye Qingtian, you’re really impressive to make it through the ninth level so quickly. Did you see the Emperor Sword?” The Crane Fairy asked, blinking her eyes.

“I’m not too sure about it.” Lin Yun saw a sword flashing past when he grabbed the Nine-Colored Heavenly Cloud Fruit, but the sword disappeared too quickly.

“Hehe, you must’ve seen it. It looks like my master didn’t make any mistakes. Let’s go, come with me to see my master,” the Crane Fairy said happily.

“I wish to refine the Heavenly Cloud Fruit first,” Lin Yun said.

“That works as well,” the Crane Fairy agreed after a brief pondering. She then turned to look at the bearded youth and said in disdain, “Li Daoyang, what are you doing here? Look at how dirty you are. How many days has it been since you’ve showered?!”

Li Daoyang? Isn’t this the name of the Dao Yang Palace’s Holy Son?

Lin Yun couldn’t help examining the bearded youth, trying to verify if his speculation was wrong. The Dao Yang Holy Son rubbed his hair before shaking his head with a smile, “Bullshit. It hasn't been days, but it has been three years since I last showered.”
