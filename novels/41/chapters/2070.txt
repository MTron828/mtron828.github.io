Chapter 2071: No Limit To Dao

Two days later, in the Iris Secret Realm. Lin Yun sat with his eyes closed beneath the Phoenix Tree, and black runes formed a flower beneath him. The black flower consisted of runes with three layers outside and inside. Thirty petals were inside, and each petal was enveloped with profound runes that looked like natural saint runes.

The outer layer had ninety petals, and the outermost layer had a hundred and eighty petals. Each petal was tightly linked; this was the complete Netherflower, with vitality being extinguished in the surroundings.

Lin Yun sat within the flower bud, his body gradually being revealed when the petals opened up. He was like a sharp sword that radiated a sharp aura as the petals opened up. When the petals opened up, and Lin Yun was revealed, he opened his eyes with his pupils shining brightly.

The Netherflower beneath him exploded into black miasma, making the ground seem like a lake. When the petals condensed into stamens and bloomed into individual Netherflowers, each Netherflower had three hundred petals.

“Transform!” With a single thought, Lin Yun formed the Nether Saint Seal with his hands. The three hundred flowers exploded, and the lake expanded with the surrounding nether energy increasing.

“Transform again!” Lin Yun circulated his nirvana aura and circulated the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra. In a short moment, his nirvana aura converted into nether energy, filling his body.

When Lin Yun changed the Nether Saint Seal, he changed the signs ten times, and the lake turned into a sea with three thousand Netherflowers. Each flower was a complete Nether Flower, and Lin Yun was seated on the ocean with his hair fluttering violently. As black light enveloped him, Lin Yun looked like a fiendgod from hell.

“Finally, my Divine Firmament Sword Sutra has reached complete mastery. The Netherflower didn’t disappoint me.” Lin Yun was satisfied as he looked at the sea of Netherflowers. When he raised his hand, the Iris Saint Seal bloomed from the back of his hand, and the sea of flowers began to rumble into a wall-like wave behind him.

This was a wall of Netherflowers, and each Netherflower emanated a powerful nether energy. When Lin Yun poured his sword intent into his finger, he flicked his finger, executing the Flicking Divine Finger.

As three thousand sword rays flew out from the Netherflowers, each sword ray pierced through the sky and extinguished all lifeform in its path. Nether energy and sword intent had merged, making each sword ray lethal.

Even a Quasi-Saint at the Azure Origin Phase would have great difficulty when facing this barrage of attacks. Nether energy could corrode saint aura, while the Astral Sword Intent could tear apart saint aura. So the fusion between the two was perfect.

Lin Yun suddenly stood up, and the three thousand flowers entered the back of his hand. His finger was like an arched bow, with his thumb pressing down on his middle finger. A massive Netherflower appeared behind him that looked like a black hole as it spun.

Lin Yun suddenly thought of the Flicking Divine Finger’s description. It was mentioned that one could even destroy a star with the flick of a finger upon reaching the peak. He only felt it was an exaggeration back then, but it seemed possible now. When he raised his head, he saw a thousand-foot mountain a hundred miles away.

With a flick of his finger, the mountain exploded and was reduced to dust. This made Lin Yun open his mouth with shock as he exclaimed, “This…”

He couldn’t even catch up with the speed of the sword ray he unleashed. When he flicked his finger, the mountain was destroyed almost immediately. When Lin Yun turned around, he locked onto nine mountains with his sword aura and flicked his finger, causing the ground to tremble as the nine mountains shattered.

This only made him sweat on his forehead as the Netherflower behind him only dimmed slightly. Raising his head, Lin Yun noticed that there were runes on the Netherflower that made it look like an ancient and mysterious array. He muttered, “What a complicated array that consists of multiple layers. I’m afraid that this might have something to do with the Great Profound Sword Canon.”

He couldn’t comprehend the runes on the array but he felt that it had something to do with the Great Profound Sword Canon.

“What are you doing? Why are you tearing this place apart?!” The commotion naturally alarmed Lil’ Purple, who pitifully looked at Lin Yun.

Lin Yun awkwardly smiled and immediately dissipated the Netherflower in the sky. He was surprised by the power of the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra empowered by Astral Sword Intent, and he was a little too excited earlier.

“You’re lucky you didn’t harm my precious tree, or I’d kill you!” Lil’ Purple glared at Lin Yun and began to caress the Phoenix Tree. The Phoenix Tree was really special because not even nether energy could do anything to it.

“Lin Yun, you made a breakthrough?” Lil’ Purple suddenly turned around and looked at Lin Yun.

Lin Yun nodded his head. After refining the Netherflower, his cultivation had reached the eighth transformation of the Nirvana Stage. If it was in the past, his strength would have transformed upon making a breakthrough. But his odds of winning weren’t high, facing a Quasi-Saint at the Azure Origin Phase. It was so much so that it wouldn’t matter much even if he reached the ninth transformation of the Nirvana Stage. His strength would only undergo a drastic transformation if he reached the tenth transformation of the Nirvana Stage.

“Sit down.” Lil’ Purple pulled Lin Yun down and said, “You’ve reached the eighth transformation of the Nirvana Stage, and you’re one step closer to the saint path. So let me tell you more about it.”

Lin Yun was stunned because he couldn’t get used to Lil’ Purple's seriousness. This naturally made Lil’ Purple furious as she roared, “Just listen up! It’s rare for me to be in the mood to tell you about it!”

Seeing that Lil’ Purple was furious, Lin Yun quickly sat down. He knew Lil’ Purple was afraid he would suffer in his fight with Feng Shaoyu, so she wanted to share some information about the saint path with him.

“Hmph! That’s more like it. Let me ask you, do you know what the saint path means?” Lil’ Purple said with a satisfied expression. She continued, “All cultivators aim to reach the saint path, and it’ll be different after reaching saint dao. You’ll be exposed to a whole new world.”

Lin Yun quickly listened to what Lil’ Purple said.

“Saint dao is the way of the world’s operation. Even things such as the blooming and withering of flowers, distance in space, and length of time consist of a certain law. Mortals can’t detect them no matter how much they cultivate. Those are complicated laws, but there are simpler ones, such as blazing fire, streaming water, and falling leaves. They’re the laws of nature, and saints would comprehend them. Only then can they reach the Quasi-Saint Realm and step into the Saint Realm.”

Lil’ Purple was detailed in her explanation and spent half a day talking about nature laws and many rare laws. She seemed to know everything and could explain every law so Lin Yun could understand them clearly. Her explanation opened Lin Yun to a new world as if he had been enlightened.

Many things that he couldn’t comprehend earlier suddenly became clear, and Lil’ Purple’s words seemed to contain dao rhythm as her words began to manifest within Lin Yun’s sword sea. Lin Yun couldn’t help involuntarily saying, “Well said.”

“That’s for sure. I listened to the lord’s preaching back then, but I was still a brat following beside the patriarch. That scene was shocking, with all races gathering to listen to his preach, and golden lotuses would rise from the ground along with his preach,” Lil’ Purple said pridefully. She continued, “Look behind you.”

When Lin Yun turned around, he realized that thirteen flowers were behind him without him knowing it, and each flower contained a different dao rhythm. But they looked strange and familiar simultaneously, as though they were extended from his blood. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

When he reached out to touch the flowers, those flowers seemed like they would shatter at any time. He asked, “What are they?”

“They’re the saint dao that you’ve comprehended. But you’ve yet to step onto the saint path. When you reach the Indigo Origin Phase in the future, you’ll instantly grasp them, but they’re mostly all common daos,” Lil’ Purple said.

“I can only comprehend saint dao after reaching the Indigo Origin Phase?” Lin Yun asked.

“That’s right. The Azure Origin Phase only converts nirvana aura into saint aura. Then again, that’s already terrifying because I believe you know how terrifying saint aura is,” Lil’ Purple smiled.

.

Lin Yun faced saint aura multiple times and was tormented by it. It was only later that he learned how to face saint aura. Simply put, he just had to ensure that he did not come in contact with saint aura. That couldn’t be helped because the Quasi-Saint Realm was different, reaching a whole new level.

Saint aura was on a new level that Lin Yun couldn’t confront with his nirvana aura. In the past, he could cross the distance in cultivation by relying on his strong foundation, but it was a different case when facing a Quasi-Saint.

“Saint aura is terrifying. After reaching the pinnacle Azure Origin Phase, all the nirvana aura will be converted into saint aura.” Lin Yun’s eyes shone brightly with enlightenment.

“That’s right. So Feng Shaoyu isn’t a pushover, and don’t underestimate him, even if he’s a pig head,” Lil’ Purple said.

Lin Yun smiled because Feng Shaoyu would probably go insane if he heard Lil' Purple’s words.

After seeing Lin Yun laugh, Lil’ Purple corrected herself, “That’s only an example. But there must be a reason why he’s the Young Manor Master.”

“It’s fine. You can carry on,” Lin Yun said.

“After fully converting their saint aura, you can try and comprehend saint dao, even if it’s just a common saint dao. But it’ll be different after you have comprehended it,” Lil’ Purple said seriously. “Strictly speaking, you can only consider stepping onto the saint path after reaching the Indigo Origin Phase because they’ll have grasped saint dao.”

Lin Yun thought deeply and said, “You mentioned common daos earlier. So does dao divide into common and uncommon? I heard the Iris Sword Saint mentioning that Nirvana Dao is an eternal dao, stronger than time and space daos, but it’s nothing before fate.”

Lil’ Purple nodded, “There are nine eternal daos in the world. Nirvana and fate are both eternal daos. Aside from that, karma, time, truth, space, yin-yang, primal chaos, and five elements…”

“Sword dao isn’t an eternal dao?” Lin Yun frowned.

“No. The sword belongs to one of the thirty-six sovereign daos. But there’s a level amongst them because there’s no limit to dao,” Lil’ Purple nodded. She wasn’t furious that she was interrupted.
