Chapter 1622 - I'm Here To Kill! (1)

“Lead the way.” Lin Yun said, executing the Divine Sunchasing Art and soaring to the sky with Gongsun Yan. As a violent wind blew, they swiftly made their way to the Saint Constellation Snow Valley.

“Lin Yun, are you serious about this?” Gongsun Yan asked after a long silence.

“What else?” Lin Yun said indifferently. “I spent an unimaginable time to reach the best I can in my movement technique, sword technique, fist technique, and physique just so that I don’t have to suck it up when others provoke me.”

At the Saint Constellation Snow Valley, Ye Ziling was at the towering tree, refining the Saint Constellation, while Mu Xueqin and Zhao Yan led the Sword Sect’s disciples to guard the valley.

Outside the valley, there was a group of people gathered together. They were all from the eight big sects, only second to the powerful sects, and they were attacking this valley under the leadership of the Profound Sky Sect.

The valley was enveloped in a blizzard with blood splashing and swords vibrating. The Sword Sect’s disciples were fending off the big sects’ assault under layers of arrays. At the heart of the array was a ball of scarlet flames that looked like a bright sun. With the empowerment of the scarlet light, everyone who charged over was sent flying back.

But the big sects’ chief disciples weren’t in a hurry and gathered around Yan Kong. As chief disciples of their respective big sects, their saint artifacts were comparable to twenty thousand rune saint artifacts, and some even had Glory Saint Artifacts!

In the sky, there were various phenomena, such as roaring flame dragons, rumbling azure lightning, phoenixes soaring to the sky, silver blood rivers, and even terrifying demonic beasts. Saint artifacts created all these phenomena, and such a massive scale was rare in the Ancient Barren Battlefield.

“The Sword Sect is being trapped?”

“This is weird. Why is the Profound Sky Sect in such a hurry to deal with the Sword Sect when the saint palace has yet to appear?”Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Ha. What is there to be curious about? The big sects already submitted to the Profound Sky Sect, so it’d be weird if the Profound Sky Sect doesn’t use them!”

“This formation is a little terrifying. The big sects’ full force is here, and Yan Kong is also around. No powerful sect will be able to take them head-on. Not to mention that I heard Gu Ruochen and Ye Qingxuan aren’t around.” The audience members were shocked when they saw this scene.

“Senior Brother Yan, why hasn’t Lin Yun shown up? Gu Ruochen and Ye Qingxuan aren’t around, either. Are we still going to wait?” asked the Azure Thunder Sect’s chief disciple, Yu Ze.

The other chief disciples were a mixture of men and women, and they turned their attention over when they heard what Yu Ze asked.

Turning back to take a few glances, Yan Kong said, “Looks like that brat won’t be showing up. Let’s end this game quickly, then. If we don’t make a move now, who knows if there will be a change in the situation after the Sword Sect refines the Sovereign Constellation.”

“Hahaha! Senior Brother Yan, you’re too humble. With you around, what incident can there be? The Saint Constellation is already in your pocket!” Someone immediately flattered Yan Kong.

Yan Kong laughed when he heard that, and he was satisfied when he heard those words. As a cold light flashed across his pupils, he commanded, “End this pitiful game. If anyone dares to interfere, consider them to be with the Sword Sect and kill them!”

Half a day later, a golden beam streaked across the sky and arrived before a snowy mountain range. When Lin Yun and Gongsun Yan landed on a mountain peak, Gongsun Yan immediately told Lin Yun, “This is the place. This place is covered in a blizzard, and the Saint Constellation is at the valley's center. That place is covered in blooming flowers, filled with boundless vitality.”

They could smell a faint blood stench, which made Gongsun Yan’s face change; this was because the stench of blood was too obvious, even from so far away. This meant that the Profound Sky Sect probably started a massacre.

“They already made a move?” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly, and a terrifying killing aura swept out from him.

Compared to when he had just entered the Ancient Barren Battlefield, Lin Yun had undergone a drastic transformation after reaching the third-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. His vitality and martial techniques had also undergone a transformation, especially the explosive increment in his vitality. This further strengthened his Blue Dragon Bone and Sovereign Dragon Fist.

“Those bastards!” Gongsun Yan said, trembling from the anger he was feeling.

“Are we going to slaughter our way over?” Gongsun Yan was furious, and he was also afraid. After all, the eight big sects were there, including Yan Kong. Cultivators at the fourth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm were seen everywhere, and the number of experts far exceeded his imagination.

“I’m here to kill.” Lin Yun said indifferently. The Sword Sect was Lin Yun’s bottom line, and he would kill anyone who dared to touch his bottom line.

Since they already fell out, there was no need for them to keep enduring it, and he could also take revenge for what happened eighteen years ago.

Stepping forth, Lin Yun’s footsteps might seem slow, but Gongsun Yan couldn’t even catch up to him, even when he pushed his movement technique to the limit.

Suddenly, Lin Yun felt a chill sweeping over him, and this made Lin Yun stop his footsteps. At the entrance of the Saint Constellation Snow Valley, there were many disciples there, and two people were kneeling on the ground.

When Gongsun Yan raised his head, he was instantly dumbfounded because those two were Jin Xuanyi and Ji Shuxuan. They were once the Twin Stars of the Earth Ranking, but they were now covered in blood, kneeling on the ground.

Taking a step out, Lin Yun instantly arrived before the valley entrance.

“Stop! Senior Brother Yan has orders to kill anyone who dares to approach!” Those guarding the entrance of the valley barked. Their faces were cold, and their eyes were filled with killing intent when they looked at Lin Yun.

“Which Senior Brother Yan?” Lin Yun asked.

“What nonsense. Is there another Senior Brother Yan in the Ancient Barren Battlefield? I’m naturally talking about the Profound Sky Saint Sovereign’s disciple, ranked third on the Profound Sky Sect’s Inner Ranking, Senior Brother Yan Kong!” Their eyes flashed with mockery and annoyance when they looked at Lin Yun.
