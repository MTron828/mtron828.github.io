Chapter 2378 - I'm Invincible (1)

A terrifying aura swept out as Yin and Yang perfectly merged on Qin Yun and the aura he gave off shocked everyone. After all, there were only nine Eternal Daos, and Qin Yun had come in contact with Yin-Yang Dao.

Suddenly, Lin Yun’s hands began to form a seal, forming the Yin-Yang Saint Seal. The two sword spirits flew out from his body, and they began to chase after each other before Lin Yun. This was something that no one had expected.

“Form!” Lin Yun roared as the two sword spirits ignited, releasing a dazzling radiance. In a split second, the spectacular flames looked as though they had entered an invisible painting. That was the Flaming Yin-Yang Painting.

“That’s also Yin-Yang Dao!”

“The two actually reached the threshold of Yin-Yang Dao!”

“How is this possible?” Exclamationsre sounded from the surroundings, with Qin Yun being shocked as well. But they had already come this far, so there was no path of retreat for them. When the two Yin-Yangs clashed, phenomena began to explode behind them, showing that they were evenly matched.

“I can’t believe a secret technique left behind by the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity can’t suppress a mere Dao Sect!” Lin Yun roared with golden light shining in his eyes, and the two sword spirits ignited.

“What power is this...” Qin Yun was horrified because the two energies in Lin Yun’s Yin-Yang painting looked as though they were alive, containing a massive power.

Qin Yun’s Yin-Yang painting shattered, and he threw out a mouthful of blood while slamming onto the ground like a cannonball. When he landed on the ground and got back up, he threw out another mouthful of blood and took two steps back before he managed to stabilize himself.

On the other hand, Lin Yun raised his hand and the Flower Burial Sword aimed at Qin Yun’s face. This sword was so fast that Qin Yun couldn’t dodge it since he had just regained his footing.

“Let’s go!” Jiang Ziyao finally couldn’t hold back any longer, and charged forth, knocking the Flower Burial Sword away.

“Scarlet Incinerating Heaven!” Heavenly Book waved the fan in his hand, and a bright sun rose to the sky with eighteen Great Solar Flames condensing into Flame Dragons that flew out like arrows.

But Lin Yun was calm as he pushed his hands forth, shattering the Flame Dragons, but would take a step back each time. In total, he took eighteen steps back.

“Are they going at him together?”

“Aren’t they a little too shameless?” Everything happened too quickly when Jiang Ziyao and Heavenly Book joined hands until everyone came to their senses.

“Sorry about this, Flower Burial!” Heavenly Book laughed. He descended before Lin Yun, and said, “Great Solar Domain!”

The flames that had scattered on the ground ignited and a massive pressure crashed down on Lin Yun.

“Azure Dragon Sword Domain!” Lin Yun spread his arms apart with his Sword Domain unleashed. However, the Sword Domain couldn’t destroy the Great Solar Domain but had overlapped instead. This surprised Lin Yun since this was the first time he had experienced this.

“Invincible swordsman? You’re nothing without your Sword Domain!” Heavenly Book laughed, and charged forth, wanting to rely on his cultivation to gain an advantage.

“It has come to an end!” Jiang Ziyao stood before Qin Yun, taking this opportunity and charging at Lin Yun. But facing him, Lin Yun only flicked his finger with his right hand while fighting Heavenly Book. When a sword ray lit up, the Flower Burial Sword flew out at an even faster speed.

“You think that I’m not a swordsman as well? You’re courting death!” Jiang Ziyao was furious upon seeing this, and wanted to knock the Flower Burial Sword away again. But when the two swords came in contact, Jiang Ziyao only felt a powerful sword aura flowing over him.

Jiang Ziyao discovered that the Great Profound Sword Array was activated again, with seven mountains rising from the ground with boundless sword aura pouring into the Flower Burial Sword. When the two swords clashed, Jiang Ziyao was forced to take a few steps back, shocking the Heavenly Sword Pavilion’s disciples.

“How dare you be distracted in our fight!” Heavenly Book was furious, seeing that Lin Yun could be distracted while fighting him, so he increased the pace of his attacks.

“So what if I’m distracted?” Lin Yun smiled, pouring the power of the Azure Dragon Divine Rune into his right foot, and his body sank like a falling mountain. When he stomped his foot, space shattered, frightening Heavenly Book into retreating.

An Azure Dragon appeared when Lin Yun stomped on the ground, and a dragon’s roar was heard. The dragon’s roar enveloped Heavenly Book, and his cheeks trembled from the shockwave as his hair fluttered in the wind. This forced Heavenly Book to raise his fan to block the shockwave. But when he lowered his fan, he saw something that he would never forget in his lifetime.

Lin Yun’s right foot hovered in the air, and he stomped his foot again as the Azure Dragon became vivid, with Lin Yun standing on the dragon’s head, laughing as his hair fluttered in the wind. His sword aura had combined with the Azure Dragon, and it felt as though nothing could restrain his sword aura.

The Azure Dragon Sword Domain was previously suppressed, but fine cracks began to appear and spread over the Great Solar Domain.

“Damn it!” Heavenly Book roared as he charged at Lin Yun again. When Lin Yun and Heavenly Book clashed, it was Heavenly Book who was being suppressed this time and he kept retreating.

Lin Yun raised his right hand and performed a flick, which made the Flower Burial Sword knock Jiang Ziyao back again under a sword vibration.

“He can do this?!” This scene left everyone dumbfounded, while the Shadow Divine Palace and Heavenly Sword Pavilion’s disciples were shocked with disbelief at this scene.

Xiong Tiannan exclaimed, “Brother Lin is too strong. I have never seen such a powerful swordsman before in my life...” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

He was filled with so many emotions that his face became red. He tried to find a word to describe his current feeling. But a long time later, he yelled, “Bravo!”

Lin Jiangxian and Ao Jue were dumbfounded. The three initially wanted to help Lin Yun, but they were greatly shocked when they saw this scene.

“I bet even the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity couldn’t do any better than him back then,” Profound Sky Venerable smiled.

On the contrary, Ji Zixi wore a charming smile. She had seen this scene multiple times back in the Kunlun Realm. This was the Lin Yun she knew, and he was invincible, even outside the Kunlun Realm.

Seeing this, Qin Yun finally couldn’t hold himself back any longer. He briefly rested, allowing his injuries to recover. He initially didn’t want to join in since he had already lost, but he couldn’t hold himself back. If he couldn’t suppress Lin Yun now, he would never get another chance to do so.

Qin Yun soared to the sky and charged at Lin Yun as well. This scene was abrupt, and Lin Yun was caught by surprise. The aura that he gave off was suppressed, and he was under tremendous pressure.

Seeing this, Heavenly Book rejoiced, “Suppress him, and don’t let him use his sword aura!”

The two had a strong rapport when they charged at Lin Yun together. But Lin Yun was calm as the Azure Dragon he was standing on entered his foot, and he swept a kick at the two. “A mere loser dares to fight me again? You must be courting death!”

With a flip, he reached out with his right palm, pouring the Azure Dragon Divine Rune into it, before unleashing a powerful suction force that forcibly separated Qin Yun and Heavenly Book. Everything happened in the blink of an eye, and no one expected Lin Yun to be so fast.

“Kill!” Heavenly Book and Qin Yun were stumped, and they charged at Lin Yun once more.

“Great!” Lin Yun sneered, using his fingers as a sword to perform the Divine Firefly Sword. As for his left hand, he was using it to control the Flower Burial Sword to fight Jiang Ziyao. The entire stage was soon covered with swords as Lin Yun fought three enemies by himself to a stalemate.

“What the hell?” Everyone was dumbfounded. Many geniuses were from the three thousand realms, such as those on the Brandished Dragon Ranking. But they couldn’t think of anyone who was like Lin Yun.

The faces of Jiang Ziyao, Qin Yun, and Heavenly Book became red as they gritted their teeth. They felt embarrassed and had grievances that geniuses like them couldn't take down someone like Lin Yun.

Jiang Ziyao, the chief disciple of the Heavenly Sword Pavilion, was having a tough time facing Lin Yun’s sword. As for Heavenly Book and Qin Yun, they were even more miserable because they were being suppressed by Lin Yun, who used his fingers as a sword.

When the firefly’s radiance shone from Lin Yun’s fingers, Lin Yun noticed that Qin Yun couldn’t recover from his injuries anymore after ten-odd moves.

Qin Yun felt like he had been plunged into ice when Lin Yun’s gaze fell on him. Before he could respond, a seven-colored radiance bloomed from Lin Yun’s fingers as he formed the Sovereign Dragon Seal with one hand.

Qin Yun tried to block this attack, but the Sovereign Dragon Seal left a hole in his chest. This inflicted heavy injuries on Qin Yun’s saint origin, with his vitality escaping from his body. When he rolled on the ground, he lost more of his life force every time he rolled.

Everyone was shocked to see that Qin Yun was dying. The faces of the spectators became pale, and Heavenly Book was so terrified that his eyes nearly fell out from their eye sockets, making him want to retreat.

But Lin Yun seemed to be prepared and had grabbed onto Heavenly Book’s wrist with his right hand.

“Let me go!” Heavenly Book screamed, but he could only see murderous intent in Lin Yun’s eyes when he raised his head. Before he could respond, Lin Yun roared as he pulled Heavenly Book over like an Azure Dragon with immense force.

Heavenly Book was ripped into two just like that as his blood rained down from the sky. Jiang Ziyao was frightened, and he quickly retreated. He retreated to where the divine disciples, Shangguan Jue and Zhao Zhanli, were located.

With that, the slogan that they chanted earlier became a joke because there were once six of them, but now there are only a few of them left.

“Everyone, go at him together! He must be reaching his limit!” Jiang Ziyao roared as the seven divine disciples, Shangguan Jue, and Zhao Zhanli began to waver.

But Lin Yun didn’t give them the time to consider as he raised his hands to the sky. Nine thousand ribbons flew over with three thousand engraved with the Azure Dragon Divine Rune, three thousand engraved with the Divine Phoenix Rune, and three thousand engraved with the Metal Divine Rune.

Lin Yun had released all his saint energy and sword intent at this moment without holding anything back. With a sweep of his gaze, he coldly said, “You guys want to come at me together? I don’t mind, as I’m invincible.”
