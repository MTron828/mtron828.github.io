Chapter 1171 - Divine Astral Flowers

The scene of tens of thousands of people falling on their knees was shocking, especially when they yelled at the same time.

Lin Yun was startled when he turned his head around and saw all the disciples kneeling before him. As their voices echoed in his ears, his heart boiled like his time back in the Sword Firmament Pavilion.

Those disciples also called him ‘Senior Brother Lin’ when he protected the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s reputation in the Great Qin Empire. Lin Yun was still young and he would turn 20 in six months. So how could his blood not boil at this scene?

He immediately cupped his hands and replied, “Heavenly Core Disciple Lin Yun thanks all of you for this honor. In the future, if there’s any trouble in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, I won’t stand by and watch!”

“Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s chief female disciple, Ye ZIling, congratulates Junior Brother Lin!” Ye Ziling also cupped her hands together.

“Thank you, Senior Sister.” Lin Yun smiled.

“Hahaha!” As a burst of laughter sounded out, the sect master’s voice echoed out, “My eyes did not fool me. Lin Yun, you’re really a genius in the sword!”

However, he didn’t say that his master also had good eyesight to take Lin Yun as a disciple.

“Without the sect master’s nurturing, I wouldn’t be able to achieve this,” replied Lin Yun. He wasn’t being courteous because the Blood Flame Dragon Rune Metal’s origin stone was crucial to achieve the Azure Dragon Saint Physique. There was also the matter of the True Dragon Saint Liquid that the sect master gave him. Furthermore, it would be tough for him to reach the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm if he didn’t have the Spirit Astral Mountain.

“This has nothing to do with me. I only provided some external help. It was only by your effort that you made it,” smiled the sect master.

Lin Yun also smiled in response. He would remember this favor in his heart and do his best to help the sect master in the future. At this moment, Lin Yun could see the excitement in the eyes of the sect master and the smile on his face that hadn’t stopped.

Simultaneously, the sect master instructed Lin Yun not to make a breakthrough to the Empyrean Realm in a hurry but spend some time getting familiar with the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm. There were too few people who reached the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm, and the sect master had no experience with it. So Lin Yun could only rely on himself to comprehend it.

Don’t rush a breakthrough? Lin Yun’s eyes lit up when he heard that. In terms of his foundation, he could reach the Empyrean Realm any time he wanted, and he could even reach the Galaxy Stage. It was unimaginable for others to cross two stages upon reaching the Empyrean Realm, but it was nothing to Lin Yun.

He felt terrible that he was stuck in the Heavenly Soul Realm for a long time. No matter how much of a monstrous genius he was, he would still face immense pressure if he ran into an enemy whose cultivation was higher than him.

If he was in the cultivation he should be in, he could easily suppress them. But he was restricted to the Heavenly Soul Realm, and he was lucky that he could kill stronger opponents. Luo Kui, for example, was only defeated after Lin Yun brought out all his trump cards besides the flute. In the end, he only had a chance because Luo Kui let his guard down.

If Luo Kui brought out his constellation in time, Lin Yun wouldn’t have killed him. In fact, Lin Yun could have lost the fight. After all, he was only in the seventh soul Heavenly Soul Realm while Luo Kui was in the pinnacle Astral Stage.

If Lin Yun was at least in the Star Realm, he would easily defeat Luo Kui even if the latter brings out his constellation. In the end, he needed to improve his cultivation.

As for fighting with Lei Ying, he was completely forced with no choice but to fight. After all, he had promised Wang Yuruo and the rest that he would bring Ye Ziling back. Otherwise, he definitely wouldn’t put himself in danger based on his personality.

Fortunately, Lei Ying was injured in the fight against the two Elysium Core Realm elders and couldn’t unleash his constellation. Otherwise, Lin Yun would have died even after wielding the flute as a sword. Lin Yun had a clear understanding of his strength. He wasn’t weak, but he was limited by his cultivation. If he could reach the Empyrean Realm, he would be able to resolve everything.

Now that he had successfully reached the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm, the sect master told him not to be anxious about reaching the Empyrean Realm, which wasn’t acceptable to Lin Yun.

“You remember what I told you previously? There’s something I need you to do when you reach the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm…” The sect master said with his eyes squinted.

“Yeah.” Lin Yun nodded his head because he had already promised the sect master previously.

“Good. Come and see me half a month from now,” smiled the sect master.

Three days passed after Lin Yun reached the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm and the entire sect was still in an uproar. In the beginning, Lin Yun was able to put up with everyone’s excitement. But as time passed, he became annoyed and hid in his residence to cultivate.

Since everyone knew that he was comprehending the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm, no one bothered him. Lin Yun could finally let out a breath of relief after reaching the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm. He had been stressed for six months, but he finally made it.

He spent every single day comprehending the Demonic Astral Flowers, the last three swords of the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords, and the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sutra. He didn’t lack resources in his cultivation, and he also didn’t have poor comprehension.

If he just followed through, he would be able to reach the highest stage of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sutra. On the other hand, he ran into some troubles with the last three swords of the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords. If he wanted to reach the manifestation stage, he had to grasp the intent and completely fuse it into his comprehension.

In the martial field in his residence, Lin Yun hovered in the sky as the 49 Demonic Astral Flowers began to blaze within his body. As golden light shined out of his body, Lin Yun’s aura broke through the Heavenly Soul Realm, reaching the pinnacle Astral Stage.

When the Demonic Astral Flowers ignited, Lin Yun could sense that his origin energy had grown drastically. In the past, igniting his Demonic Astral Flowers could strengthen his origin energy by three times. But now, it was seven times stronger!

Aside from that, the dragon aura from his Azure Dragon Saint Physique had grown greatly when the Demonic Astral Flowers were ignited. After reaching the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm, the Demonic Astral Flowers could also boost his movement technique, physique, and even sword intent. It was a comprehensive boost to his strength.

When a violent breeze blew over, Lin Yun couldn’t open his eyes, but his body reacted. He took a step forward and threw out a punch, sending Lil’ Red flying back. Lin Yun didn’t need to open his eyes nor did he try to sense Lil’ Red’s position. Just like that, he easily fended off ten attacks from Lil’ Red. Not only did he avoid the attacks from Lil’ Red, but he even counterattacked.

Lil’ Red let out a furious roar before it took on the dracoape form. The sky turned dark as a gigantic dragon figure appeared above Lil’ Red’s head, creating a terrifying vortex and tearing the void apart.

When Lin Yun suddenly opened his eyes, he activated the Azure Dragon Mark. He was instantly enveloped in a thunderstorm that perfectly fused with his origin energy. When he clashed with Lil’ Red once more, his fist sent Lil’ Red’s gigantic body several steps backwards.

Lil’ Red was surprised by this because Lin Yun didn’t use his sword intent. Lin Yun had merely used his origin energy and brute strength to send it flying. Unlike their spar six days ago when Lin Yun could barely fend off the attacks, he didn’t need to try now.

“You aren’t fully circulating the Ancient Dracoape Art, so I’m not using my full strength,” smiled Lin Yun. He didn’t bring out his Demonic Astral Flowers. If he did, his aura would grow even further. However, the Demonic Astral Flowers were his last resort because they would exhaust his origin energy quickly. Plus, if they exploded, he would have to wait a long time for them to recover.

This was also the secret in the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm that Lil’ Purple told him. After all, Lil’ Purple knew more about the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm compared to the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s sect master. Aside from that, Lil’ Purple also told him that this was only the beginning because those geniuses who had successfully reached the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm in ancient times only had seven Demonic Astral Flowers in the air.

All the Demonic Astral Flowers in their aura oceans would fuse into one, leaving behind one Demonic Astral Flower in each aura ocean before heading beyond the thirty-six heavens to retrieve the divine flames to become Divine Astral Flowers.

The Divine Astral Flower had forty-seven petals, and each petal had a ninth-grade saint rune engraved on it with a divine rune engraved on the flower bud. At that time, one petal would be able to slay a saint, and the Divine Astral Flower could destroy a star. And after forming the Seven Astral Divine Array, they would be filled with unbelievable power.

Lin Yun was stunned when he heard that, which made Lil’ Purple mock him.

“Hmph. You only know how to bully Lil’ Red. Lil’ Red just doesn’t want to injure you. Why are you so happy about it?” Lil’ Purple said unhappily seeing the look on Lin Yun’s face.

Hearing that, Lin Yun blinked his eyes and extinguished the flames on the Demonic Astral Flowers. Then, he landed in front of Lil’ Purple. After a brief pondering, he told her what the sect master told him, especially since the sect master told him not to make a breakthrough to the Empyrean Realm so urgently.

“The greatest benefit in reaching the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm is attaining the Unrivaled Stage. At that time, not only will you be able to fully excavate your potential, it will further expand your potential by several times. So only an idiot would make a breakthrough,” said Lil’ Purple in disdain. “That old geezer is full of nonsense. At this time, you should further excavate your potential. When you’re done, you’ll be invincible among the same realm upon reaching the Empyrean Realm.”

Lin Yun smiled awkwardly and didn’t tell her that he was the fool who wanted to make a breakthrough to the Empyrean Realm.

“But you can’t take too long either. You should make a breakthrough to the Empyrean Realm in one month at the most. After all, you still have the leaves from the Divine Blood Fruit, and you can try to refine a leaf.” Lil’ Purple then looked around before she smiled, “At that time, you’ll be able to trample all those people on the Empyrean Ranking!”

Lin Yun was speechless when she heard that. He knew the weight the Empyrean Realm held. After all, there was no limit to the age, and there were many old monsters there as well.

So those who were in the top 10,000 were practically in the quasi-Elysium Core Realm. Furthermore, it was a ranking that consisted of the entire Eastern Desolation. Although Lin Yun had a huge goal in his heart, he didn’t dare to wish for more now.

“What do you think the sect master needs me to do?” Now that he looked at it, he would have to look for the sect master in twelve days. This wasn’t the first time the sect master had mentioned it, and the sect master was practically invincible in the Profound Azure Prefecture with his strength. So why would he need help from someone who wasn’t even in the Empyrean Realm?

If it was something that not even the sect master could accomplish, Lin Yun wasn’t confident that he could.

“That old geezer is terrible, always wearing a foul face. He definitely doesn’t have any good intentions, and that daughter of his is also bad,” said Lil’ Purple.

“You’re not allowed to speak badly of Ye Ziling,” Lin Yun said.

“Hmph. You scumbag. If you didn’t stop me, I would’ve crushed her to death long ago with a finger,” said Lil’ Purple.

“Since when did I stop you?” Lin Yun smiled.

“Hmph. Then let’s go and erase her!” Lil’ Purple said with her tone filled with killing intent.

Right at this moment, Lin Yun could sense someone approaching the residence and smiled, “No need. She’s already here.”

“Who?” asked Lil’ Purple.

“Ye Ziling”

“...” Lil’ Purple’s face turned white when she heard that and she disappeared into the sword box.

Seeing Lil’ Purple’s reaction, Lin Yun couldn’t help shaking his head with a smile before he headed towards the gate. He hadn’t met Ye Ziling since he reached the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm, and it was time for them to meet.
