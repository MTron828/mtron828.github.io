Chapter 857 - Test Begins

Following Yu Haotian’s gaze, Yan Mo soon locked onto Lin Yun with surprise. He couldn’t detect any sword intent from Lin Yun. However, he had a feeling that Lin Yun was a lot stronger than Mu Han.

“You really are a monster.” The cold light in Yan Mo’s eyes calmed down before he continued, “I now believe that you really grasped the spiritual sword intent. Release it and let me experience it.”

Oh? Zhong Xuan of the Mountain Western Domain wore a weird expression because Yan Mo actually retracted his killing aura. It looks like Lin Yun isn’t as simple as I expected. Everyone from the Gauze Eastern Domain were demonic cultivators, so they naturally had a nasty temper. But even so, his tone wasn’t friendly and it sounded as if he was giving an order.

“Lin Yun, did you hear that? Let Young Master Yan Mo experience your spiritual sword intent.” Yu Haotian wore a playful smile as he looked at Lin Yun with a cold light flashing through his pupils.

The other geniuses from the Gauze Eastern Domain looked at Lin Yun with an unfriendly gaze. Even if Lin Yun grasped the spiritual sword intent, he was still from the Ancient Southern Domain.

Lin Yun had no intention of humoring Yan Mo or Yu Haotian. In fact, his killing intent began to surge in his eyes because Yu Haotian was really starting to annoy him. Additionally, he didn’t have a favorable opinion about Yan Mo. He wasn’t bothered by Yan Mo’s identity as a demonic cultivator or as the champion of Gauze Eastern Domain, but Yan Mo was trying to cause trouble.

Lin Yun knew that it was meaningless to make a move here because he couldn’t kill anyone. So if Yan Mo annoyed him, Lin Yun was happy to let him experience the horror of the spiritual sword intent.

Seeing Lin Yun’s indifferent attitude, Yan Mo’s face became cold again. “You’re boring. You better not run into me during the test or I’ll show you that you’re just a piece of trash. I don’t even care if you’ve grasped the spiritual sword intent!”

After he left, Mu Han and the others felt relieved. Yan Mo was too terrifying and his killing intent had practically penetrated their bodies.

“Yan Mo isn’t a pushover. He’s a super genius from the Gauze Eastern Domain. The Profound Domain’s champion might not even be his opponent,” said Qing Tu with a grave expression. “He won’t dare to act wantonly in the Profound Amber Mountain. However, you have to be careful if you run into him.”

At this moment, footsteps sounded out once from the entrance. There was no doubt that the Profound Domain’s geniuses were about to show up. The one leading the party was a middle-aged man named Gao Zhangtian from the Sacred Alliance. He was the main host of this test and he was the strongest elder present.

When Lin Yun directed his gaze over, he could sense an immense power. Gao Zhangtian was a Heavenly Soul Realm expert with at least six souls unlocked.

“Looks like everyone is here.” Gao Zhangtian casually looked at everyone and smiled, “I believe everyone knows that the Heavenly Path is filled with opportunities. It’s hard to reach the Heavenly Soul Realm in the Profound Amber Realm. However, if you guys catch the attention of the powerful forces in Kunlun Realm, the Empyrean Realm might not be your limit…”

His words caused flames to blaze in everyone’s hearts because these were the opportunities they wanted. After all, the Profound Amber Realm was too small and it could no longer satisfy them. Since there were only eight quotas left, many people weren’t destined to make it into the Heavenly Path. So one could imagine how intense the fight would be.

Lin Yun stood beside Yue Weiwei and looked at the white-clothed youth behind Gao Zhangtian. This man was incredibly handsome, on par with Nangong Wanyu, which attracted many people’s attention. However, Lin Yun paid more attention to his strength because he didn’t seem any weaker than Yan Mo. The only difference was that he was more restrained.

He was the champion of Profound Domain, Fang Shaoyu. Lin Yun had heard about him from Qing Tu. Lin Yun retracted his gaze and fell into deep thought. It appeared that the test was truly a lot tougher than he had imagined because none of the champions were pushovers. On top of that, there were only eight quotas. Then, Lin Yun’s gaze fell on Yue Weiwei.

“Big Brother Yun, are you worried that I won’t be able to obtain the quota?” Yue Weiwei smiled with her eyes narrowed.

“A little,” replied Lin Yun.

“Don’t worry about me. You must perform well or else you won’t be able to obtain the quota,” smiled Yue Weiwei. As they talked, Fang Shaoyu of Profound Domain left Gao Zhangtian and walked over. Since the elders were gathered together to open the teleportation array, the competitors had nothing to do.

“You must be Flower Burial Lin Yun, right? And are you Yue Weiwei? You’re indeed as beautiful as they say.” Not only did Fang Shaoyu recognize Lin Yun, but he also knew about Yue Weiwei.

Yue Weiwei and Lin Yun both exchanged a glance before they bowed.

Meanwhile, Fang Shaoyu examined Lin Yun briefly before he said, “You’re a lot stronger than the rumors.”

“You’re being too polite.” Lin Yun said as his heart sank. It appeared that Fang Shaoyu had seen through some of his secrets.

After the simple greeting, Fang Shaoyu smiled and returned to the Profound Domain’s party. He then talked to an elder among the Profound Domain’s party. If one had keen hearing, they would definitely hear Fang Shaoyu’s shock. Fang Shaoyu had sensed that Lin Yun’s yin-yang ring in his violet palace had solidified.

“He came to examine your strength,” said Yue Weiwei. “They’re thinking really intensely. So what if they manage to enter the Heavenly Path? It’s good enough if they can survive.”

Lin Yun’s eyes flickered because he didn’t hear what Fang Shaoyu said, but Yue Weiwei seemed to have heard it. It looks like he didn’t have to worry about Yue Weiwei anymore. As for the Heavenly Path, it was naturally more important to everyone present. No one was willing to give up on this opportunity.

“The teleportation array is prepared. I believe all of you know about the rules, so I won’t waste time talking about it. You may enter now.” Many people’s hearts throbbed with excitement after they heard Gao Zhangtian’s words. In the next second, many people charged into the array.

“You guys can go in as well,” said Qing Tu.

“Okay.” Everyone was nervous as they entered the teleportation array because they didn’t know what they would encounter.

Lin Yun sent Yue Weiwei off before he looked at Yu Haotian. Yu Haotian’s gaze was cold and indifferent. When their eyes met, Lin Yun didn’t conceal his killing intent. With a flash, they both stepped into the teleportation array and were transported to the test ground.

When everyone entered the teleportation array, Gao Zhangtian laughed, “Let’s go to the peak to watch.”

At the peak of the Profound Amber Mountain, was another array. However, this one was more ancient than the one below. It also had eight glows that would spawn those who obtained the quota. Once all eight gathered, they would wait here for the Heavenly Path.

Under the control of several Sacred Alliance’s spiritualists, a screen appeared in the array. Everyone could see the contenders clear as day.

When Lin Yun’s vision returned, he saw a spacious path before him. Both sides of the pathway were dark despite the flames blazing on the walls.

“The test should have started.” Lin Yun knew that the test wouldn’t be easy. When he took a step out, he instantly felt as though he had stepped into a quagmire.

Interesting. Lin Yun smiled and barked, “Azure Dragon Enneaform!”

Purple lightning began to crackle on the surface of Lin Yun’s body, allowing him to move like normal. With every step he took, the path swayed like it would collapse. It wasn’t until he was halfway that the path began to crack and collapse.

Lin Yun’s face changed when he saw the cracks spread out even faster.

Spreading his arms apart, golden light exploded from Lin Yun as he zoomed forward. He understood that this path was testing his physique. As he charged forward, he saw a bronze gate at the end of the path.

“Break!” Lin Yun didn’t have any time for useless thoughts, so he threw out a punch. His gaze became sharp because he had a rough idea of what was behind the gate. He would probably enter a bloodbath where the loser would be eliminated. Since there were a total of three stages, this was the first stage Lin Yun had to face.

“Come on then!” Lin Yun was determined to obtain the quota to the Heavenly Path. As cold light flashed in his pupils, his punch shattered the bronze gate into countless fragments.

Within the fragments, Lin Yun saw a key and grabbed it. Then, he passed through the gate and saw a massive hall where three people were fighting. All of them were releasing terrifying auras as their attacks created explosions.

As soon as Lin Yun set foot in the hall, all three people looked at him coldly. Lin Yun instantly sensed the unusual atmosphere as he looked at them.
