Chapter 1611 - Ancient Demonic Spirit Corpse

The azure dragon formed by Cang Yun’s dragon runes was vivid. Paired with his four dragon pulses, the azure dragon released a terrifying dragon aura. As the dragon’s roar echoed, a violent gale broke apart the demonic clouds with lightning lighting up the black mountain.

“True Dragon Aura?” Lin Yun was surprised as he muttered to himself.

“Not bad for you to realize it. I’m not afraid to tell you. In the entire Ancient Barren Domain, 80% of the true dragon saint liquids are in the hands of the Vajra Monastery, and we even have genuine dragon blood.” Cang Yun smiled. “To practice this Azure Dragon Saint Art, I spent sixty thousand kilograms of true dragon saint liquid, six hundred kilograms of dragon blood, and an Azure Dragon True Bone. Aside from the Azure Dragon True Bone that took me trouble, I can easily gather the rest.”

Lin Yun finally understood how Cang Yun managed to grasp the Azure Dragon Saint Art. With an Azure Dragon True Bone, dragon blood, and sixty thousand kilograms of true dragon saint liquid, it wasn’t weird that Cang Yun could reach such a level in the Azure Dragon Saint Art.

“You’re distracted by your sword path, but I’m not distracted by anything. So you don’t have to find it weird.” Cang Yun smiled. He had no ill intentions against Lin Yun, he was just trying to show off. He was satisfied with Lin Yun’s current expression, since was determined to shock Lin Yun two years ago.

“Don’t even think about the Nether Saint Sword. Just obediently stay here.” Cang Yun laughed. Since he was already close to Lin Yun, he suddenly made a move, and his hand enveloped him. When the azure dragon fused into his palm, it manifested into a dragon claw clad in thunderstorms that tugged the sky down.

But Lin Yun didn’t panic. He circulated the Blue Dragon Bone to execute the Divine Dragon Eyes. In a split second, the Glorysun and Glorymoon Spirits hidden within his pupils shone brightly with the Blue Dragon Seal, White Dragon Seal, and Golden Dragon Seal activated. The seals formed into flames that revolved around the Glorysun and Glorymoon Spirits before they started to rotate even faster.

As a divine dragon’s aura swept out, Cang Yun’s True Dragon Aura was instantly suppressed, and his attack gradually collapsed.

“How is this possible…?” Cang Yun was shocked because he clearly never expected this scene. As alarms rang in his heart, he swiftly retreated.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Too late.” Lin Yun smiled, circulating the Azure Dragon Saint Art that reached the pinnacle of complete mastery. The forty thousand dragon runes within the Blue Dragon Bone were all activated and poured into his palm.

Gritting his teeth, Cang Yun could only face Lin Yun head-on while retreating. In just a split second, they exchanged ten-odd moves, and each collision was like two dragons clashing together.

As Cang Yun’s dragon runes continued to shatter, Lin Yun’s dragon runes continued to appear on his body. In the end, Lin Yun’s palm landed on Cang Yun’s chest, destroying all the dragon runes he had on him.

Throwing a mouthful of blood, Cang Yun fell to his knees, and his face became pale. Just when he was about to get up, a boundless thunderstorm descended from the sky, and Lin Yun’s speed was so fast that Cang Yun couldn’t avoid it in time. The dragon claw hovered above his head, making Cang Yun feel suffocating. As he maintained one knee on the ground, his face was distorted by the pain.

“Even if the Azure Dragon Bone is strong, it’s nothing compared to a Divine Dragon Bone!” Lin Yun said, looking at Cang Yun. He then slowly walked over. If it was the Azure Dragon King Bone that was left behind by the Azure Dragon King, it would make sense if he lost in terms of physique. But since it was only an Azure Dragon Bone, it was a little too lacking.

“What do you want?” Cang Yun’s lips trembled with fear rising in his heart.

“To dig out your dragon bone!” Lin Yun said as he increased his speed and disappeared.

This made Cang Yun tremble in fear, his face becoming pale. Cang Yun felt despair when thinking of the terrifying consequences of his dragon bone being dug out. He wanted to beg for mercy but couldn’t even utter a word.

When Lin Yun reappeared before Cang Yun, his hand swiftly stretched out. But he didn’t dig Cang Yun’s dragon bone. Instead, his finger pointed at Cang Yun’s brows as a light shot into the latter’s mind.

A brief moment later, Cang Yun widened his eyes in disbelief, looking at Lin Yun. He was deeply shocked and couldn’t believe it because Lin Yun passed him the Azure Dragon Grasp. He asked in a trembling tone, “You’re not here to dig out my dragon bone?”

Cang Yun was shocked that Lin Yun would hand over such a powerful secret technique to him, and he couldn’t believe that this was all real.

“I’m just joking.” Lin Yun smiled. “In the beginning, I thought I tricked you, but I never expected that you would succeed. So I might give this to you as well; consider it a sign of goodwill.”

“Why?” Cang Yun asked. He still couldn’t believe that this was all real.

“I already said, a sign of goodwill. You showed no killing intent toward me, or you would already be dead.” Lin Yun said casually.

“You’re not afraid I’ll come after you after learning it?”

“Oh.” Lin Yun gave Cang Yun an eye for him to comprehend himself, which made Cang Yun’s lips twitch because he was being disregarded.

With a smile, Lin Yun continued, “You don’t believe me? I’ll be honest with you, then. You can't stop my sword, no matter how powerful your physique becomes. You have already reforged your bones with the fourth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. You can easily block most saint artifacts paired with your Azure Dragon Saint Physique.”

“That’s for sure.” Cang Yun nodded.

When he was done, Lin Yun suddenly moved and tapped on Cang Yun’s chest. As his sword ray shone on his finger, it instantly drilled a hole in Cang Yun’s chest, and blood flowed out. Despite the pain distorting Cang Yun’s face, Cang Yun’s face became ugly, “You!”

Lin Yun was simply too ruthless!

“This is to tell you not to make things difficult for my Sword Sect’s disciples since I can kill you anytime I want. Secondly, we must make it look real, even if we’re acting. Otherwise, you’ll be in trouble if your senior brother comes after you.” Lin Yun smiled and winked.

But Cang Yun naturally wouldn’t believe it as the corner of his lips twitched. He felt that Lin Yun was taking revenge on him because he was too arrogant earlier.

“Find a place and hide. You’re too lazy, so it’s best if you don’t get involved with the Ancient Barren Battlefield’s affair. The Azure Dragon Grasp is enough for you to comprehend for a long time.” Lin Yun said.

Cang Yun wasn’t stupid, and he knew Lin Yun was secretly telling him to leave because Lin Yun would clash with the Vajra Monastery later over the Nether Saint Sword.

“You’re already so strong without drawing your sword. So how strong are you after drawing your sword?” Cang Yun said with lingering fear, looking at the sword box behind Lin Yun.

“Don’t be curious about something you shouldn’t know. Oh, remember to find an Azure Dragon King’s true bone.” Lin Yun urged.

Cang Yun flung his lip and went down the mountain while clutching his chest. But just when he was about to step off the platform, he was surprised because he noticed that Lin Yun wasn’t in a hurry to climb the summit. He sat down beneath the waterfall, allowing the deadly aura to sweep through him, and a netherflower slowly appeared behind him. But Cang Yun soon shook his head because he couldn’t comprehend what Lin Yun was trying to do.

Beneath the waterfall, Lin Yun circulated the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra to absorb the nether energy within the waterfall. He knew it would take some time for the competition for the Nether Saint Sword to be determined. It wasn’t an excellent choice to clash with the three sects head-on, either. He didn’t have to clash with them so quickly.

So he would take this opportunity to push his Divine Firmament Sword Sutra to the sixth stage. As nether energy poured into his body, the Netherflower within Lin Yun’s body received great nourishment, and the Netherflower’s petals started to emit a dazzling radiance. As the powerful nether energy filled his body, it swiftly gathered on the Nether Sword.

“What speed!” Lin Yun was inwardly shocked because the nether energy here was too massive. It was ten-odd times more than the Netherflower he had previously refined, and he could only endure facing such terrifying nether energy for an hour.

“An hour should be enough for me to reach the sixth stage.” Lin Yun inwardly muttered before speeding up the circulation of the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra.

At the summit of black mountain, Chen Tao was startled since he was the first to reach the summit. The ground was covered with dried-up corpses, which were extremely old. Their foreheads had traces of caving-in, looking like a vertical eye on the foreheads.

“The Demonspirit Clan!” Chen Tao’s face changed.

He was the chief disciple of the Emerald Jade Manor, and he naturally recognized the Demonspirit Clan’s origins. They were fiends, the cause of the chaos in the Darkest Era. Looking ahead, he could see a Demonspirit Clan’s expert stabbed into the ground by that Nether Saint Sword.

The waves of nether energy passed through the chest of that Demonspirit Clan’s corpse before flowing onto the ground. Without a second thought, Chen Tao dashed at the Nether Saint Sword. After all, it was a Sovereign Saint Artifact.

But when he took several steps forth, he felt an immense obstruction. Looking at the Nether Saint Sword, Chen Tao’s eyes blazed with flames, and his Glazed Treasure Physique became even more brilliant. He pushed his pinnacle fourth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm to the limit and emitted a dazzling glow that tore the demonic clouds apart.

Xuan Feng and Xiao Kui followed right behind him, and they were both briefly stunned before they chased after Chen Tao.

“You guys are fast!” Chen Tao turned back and smiled, but he wasn’t too affected. The three’s strengths were similar, and he was faster than them. This meant it would be impossible for those two to catch up to him.

“Damn it!” Xiao Kui cursed. His aura was like a blade suppressing the Nether Saint Sword.

Xiao Kui and Xuan Jian tried their best, but no matter how they tried, they were behind Chen Tao.

Fifteen minutes later, when Chen Tao arrived before the Nether Saint Sword, he lowered his head to look at the Demonspirit Clan’s corpse that was plunged into the ground by the sword. The caved-in portion on its forehead looked silver, and it emitted a noble aura.
