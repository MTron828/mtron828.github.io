Chapter 1348 - Golden Crow Plume Feather

Lin Yun sat on the ground and circulated the Iris Sword Sutra to fill his body with astral energy. As the astral energy enveloped the Profound Wither Key, it didn’t take long for them to fuse together. Clearing his mind, Lin Yun controlled the Profound Wither Key to continue to devour the light coming from the Great Saint Origin.

The key was stabbed into his chest, and he had blood dripping down from his heart. He felt an immense pain, but didn’t dare to be distracted by it. In the end, he could only bear with the pain. The power from the Great Saint Origin was too terrifying. Only the Profound Wither Key could act as a container for the Great Saint Origin, and this wasn’t something he could bear even if his physique was comparable to a thousand-rune saint artifact.

After all, his internal organs, blood, and bones hadn’t been refined. So there was no way it could bear the power of the Great Saint Origin. Under immense pain, Lin Yun entered a blank state and focused all of his attention on controlling the Profound Wither Key to seal the Great Saint Origin.

Right at that moment, a figure entered. This person was the Sword Emperor, Yu Qingfeng. When Yu Qingfeng landed on the ground, he looked at all the withering saint herbs and the essence of the saint elixirs that were turning into celestial aura that filled every corner of this space.

The essence was being subconsciously absorbed by the bodies of Jiang Lichen and the others. As the celestial aura entered their bodies, their auras began to rise at a rapid speed.

“What a pity.” Yu Qingfeng sighed. As he swept his gaze over Jiang Lichen and the others, he was shocked when he saw Ye Ziling. In a split second, Yu Qingfeng came before Ye Ziling with the shock in his eyes growing even deeper.

“The Divine Dragon Sword Physique with the Radiant Snow Clan’s saint bloodline. This is really a good sapling. You must’ve suffered greatly over the years…” Yu Qingfeng muttered. If one of them awakens, she would be comparable to a fated transcendent, but if they awaken at the same time, then they would clash with each other.

“Yu Qingfeng, you’re here,” said the Profound Wither Great Saint.

“You do your thing, first. These brats are really interesting,” smiled Yu Qingfeng. “Let me help you, then.”

When his finger tapped on Ye Ziling’s forehead, a draconic roar echoed from her body as purple snow flowers appeared, and each of the flowers contained a terrifying lightning energy. Under his finger, the Divine Dragon Sword Physique and the Radiant Snow Clan’s saint bloodline began to fuse together.

“Radiant Snow and Divine Dragon, what should it be called after the two merge together?” Yu Qingfeng briefly pondered before his eyes lit up and smiled. “Divine Radiant Dragon Physique, sounds pretty good.”

Nodding his head, Yu Qingfeng’s aura then fell onto Su Ziyao. He was stumped and his smile also gradually disappeared from his face. As his face changed, he could sense that there was an energy in Su Ziyao’s body that seemed to come from a friend, “This familiar aura…”

“Interesting…” Yu Qingfeng smiled but he didn’t get close to Su Ziyao. He appeared beside the Profound Wither Great Saint, instead. When he saw the blood on Lin Yun’s chest, he shook his head and asked, “How pitiful. Do you really have to do it this way?”

“If there’s no container, absorbing the Great Saint Origin is no different from death,” said the Profound Wither Great Saint.

Glancing at him, Yu Qingfeng said, “So this is the Profound Wither Key. Why didn’t I hear about it before? Alright, I’m here for the Seven Treasured Glazed Tile Pagoda. I’ve helped you once back then, and you already found the person that you’re waiting for. So it’s fine for me to take the Seven Treasured Glazed Tile Pagoda, right?”

“Let’s wait. At least after these kids leave,” replied the Profound Wither Great Saint.

“That works, too.” Yu Qingfeng looked around. The Seven Treasured Glazed Tile Pagoda was still pretty good. Although it had long lost the profound amber and could no longer be restored to how it once was, it had a heaven-defying ability that was important to other saints. More accurately speaking, other holy lands had it, but not the Skysolute City.

“I’ll go look around first, then,” said Yu Qingfeng. It was hard to imagine that an emperor who was given ‘Sword’ as his title would look so casual.

“Wait!” The Profound Wither Great Saint briefly hesitated before he continued, “If possible, help me look after this child.”

He naturally knew that the Great Saint Origin would bring Lin Yun trouble. He was in control on the Profound Wither Island, but not outside.

Yu Qingfeng was briefly stunned before he smiled. “Looks like you’ve been planning this since then. But I can’t do anything with my current state. If he can persevere through it, then it won’t matter much to me since it’s just one sword.”

Taking two steps out, Yu Qingfeng briefly hesitated before he pointed at Su Ziyao and asked, “Do you know who what girl is?”

Looking at Su Ziyao, the Profound Wither Great Saint locked his brows briefly before he replied, “I can roughly guess it.”

“Fate is really bizarre. The karma from three thousand years ago is falling onto them once more.” Yu Qingfeng looked at Su Ziyao with a complicated gaze before he left because she was really like her.

An hour later, the Great Saint Origin fused into the Profound Wither Key, and the wound on Lin Yun’s chest was slowly closing up. When he reopened his eyes, he let out a breath of relief, seeing that the Profound Wither Great Saint was still around.

“Someone was here earlier?” Lin Yun asked because he could faintly sense another aura, to which the Profound Wither Great Saint replied by nodding his head.

“Senior, I have a painting that I’d like you to take a look at.” Lin Yun took out the rose painting from his interspatial pouch and asked, “I want to ask if this is the Life-Death Painting.”

“This isn’t the Life-Death Painting. It was a painting that my master created in the later part of his life, and there are three sword techniques hidden within it. They’re called Dustlight, Carefree, and Nine Firmament. Your attainment in spiritual runes isn’t high enough, so you can’t comprehend the profundity,” explained the Profound Wither Great Saint. “This painting and the Flower Burial Sword were placed in my master’s tomb with his clothes.”

“The tomb with his clothes?” Lin Yun asked in a surprised tone.

“My master had three powerful treasures when he was alive, the Life-Death Painting, Heavenly Dragon Bone, and the Heaven Summoning Talisman. The first one contains his comprehension of life-death dao and was constructed with divine runes. It was a treasure that my master had refined himself. As for the other two, they have a long history, but they are also what other people want the most.” The Profound Wither Great Saint sighed. “But it’s a pity that I have no idea where they are. My master left the three treasures in his real tomb, waiting for his successor. But there are too many people eyeing his treasures, so my master created nine tombs that only contain his clothes, aside from his real tomb.”

At this moment, Lin Yun finally knew what was going on.

“One day, you will have an opportunity to enter Master’s tomb. Remember to let Master and his wife rest in peace,” said the Profound Wither Great Saint as his body gradually became transparent.

“Senior!” Lin Yun yelled.

As the Profound Wither Great Saint gradually began to disappear, he still wore a smile on his face, “Good child. You don’t have to feel sad for me because I’m happy that I can see the Flower Burial Sword before my death. I cultivated the life-death dao, so I naturally saw through life and death. It’s just a reincarnation cycle…”

“Senior!” Lin Yun yelled out in a sorrowful voice with his eyes becoming watery. They had just known each other for barely a day, but he couldn’t see him now. This outcome was tough for him to accept.

“Lin Yun, what he said is right. You don’t have to feel sad for him because he has fulfilled his last wish of finding a successor to his Great Saint Origin.” Lil’ Purple’s voice resounded and continued, “You should undo the first seal and reach the Elysium Core Realm before working hard to refine it entirely.”

Lil’ Purple flew out from his sword box with a stone tablet in her hand. It was the stone tablet that they swiped from Cang Yun.

“The flow of time here is different from the outside world. A month here is equivalent to three days in the outside world.” Lil’ Purple looked around before she muttered, “The Seven Treasured Glazed Tile Pagoda is still pretty suitable for cultivation even after losing the profound amber. But it’s a pity that we can’t bring it with us. Then again, time-space law requires an astronomical sum of resources, so it’s useless for you to take it with you.”

“One month here is equivalent to three days outside?” Lin Yun asked.

“That’s right. There are still many saint elixir essences here, so this place is absolutely suitable to make a breakthrough,” said Lil’ Purple.

Lin Yun nodded his head and looked at the stone tablet before he continued, “Are you done investigating the stone tablet?”

“Why do I need to investigate?” Lil’ Purple replied in disdain. “I was born before heaven, and I’m eighteen years old, one year for each era. How can there be any ancient runes that I don’t recognize?”

“So, what’s written on it?” Lin Yun asked, ignoring Lil’ Purple’s boast.

“You’re pretty lucky. This stone tablet has the Elysium Core Realm and Dragon Pulse Realm portion of the Divine Sunchasing Art recorded on it, along with how to manifest the Golden Crow Wings’ secret technique. But that’s not the most important thing about this tablet…” Lil’ Purple kept Lin Yun in suspense as she handed the stone tablet over. “I’ve already broken the restriction. So you can crush it and take a look. It’ll depend on your luck to see if you get an origin saint rune or an origin divine rune.”

Taking the stone tablet, Lin Yun took a deep breath before he crushed it. When the stone tablet crumbled, a golden plume feather appeared from it. Seeing the feather, Lil’ Purple and Lin Yun were briefly disappointed before their eyes lit up because there was an origin saint rune engraved on it that was emitting a blazing light.

“The Golden Crow Plume Feather!” Lil’ Purple rejoiced. “It’s actually the Golden Crow Plume Feather! You can use it as a foundation to manifest the real Golden Crow Wings. You’re already very lucky, even if it’s not a divine rune! Tsk, tsk. A Golden Crow Plume Feather with an origin saint rune engraved on it, it’s something that even I didn’t foresee.”Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m
