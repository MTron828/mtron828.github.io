Chapter 980 - Shattering the sky with One Seal!

In the blink of an eye, three days had passed. Lin Yun had cultivated the Ten Profound Steps, or rather, the Golden Crow Nine Transformations to greater mastery. It wouldn’t have been possible without his shocking talent and location. Without the clan of Golden Crows observing him, it would have been impossible for him to reach greater mastery in just three days.

The inheritances everyone obtained in the Seven Constellation Palaces were more or less the same. But Lin Yun’s inheritance was perfect for the Sunchasing Art because he could use it for his other techniques. After all, none of them had an imperial fortune movement technique.

The Ten Profound Steps corresponded with the Golden Crow’s nine transformations. It was a movement technique completely different from what Lin Yun had imagined. Initially, he thought that it was a martial technique used to escape or increase one’s speed. But the Golden Crow Nine Transformations had widened his perspective because he could manifest a Golden Crow aura to kill his opponents. Furthermore, he could also use the aura to suppress his enemies.

The stage beneath Lin Yun began to light up with golden brilliance as if a hibernating Golden Crow was soaring into the sky. When he soared into the sky, a Golden Crow’s cry echoed out on the horizon as Lin Yun travelled on the invisible soundwave.

Lin Yun’s movement technique was fast. With another crow cry, nine Golden Crow afterimages overlapped on Lin Yun. He felt like he was a genuine Golden Crow.

“This Golden Crow Nine Transformations is really impressive. There’s no way the Seven Profound Steps can compare to it. This one contains the essence of the Sunchasing Art and manifests the dao into a golden crow!” Lin Yun’s eyes flickered with excitement.

The Golden Crow Nine Transformation was meant to use nine transformations to search for the Golden Crow’s dao rhyme and essence. It was extraordinary.

Thinking about it, Lin Yun soared into the sky, leaving behind many afterimages. When the afterimages overlapped, his aura soared and manifested into a massive Golden Crow. When Lin Yun raised his head, the Golden Crow’s pupils stared ahead as its prestige merged with Lin Yun.

“Impressive!” Lin Yun’s face was filled with excitement before he sat back down to practice the Ten Profound Steps. In the blink of an eye, another seven days had passed. When Lin Yun opened his eyes, everything in the surroundings began to shatter and fade away.

When the realm disappeared, Lin Yun could vaguely see a boundless sun being grabbed by a hand. When that hand made a fist, the sun disappeared into the starry sky. At the last moment, Lin Yun was able to see that the owner of the hand had a pair of gigantic wings.

When everything returned to normal, Lin Yun found that he was still in the valley. However, the nine paintings had been incinerated into ashes. When he raised his head, he could see the winged statue looking at him. In that split second, the winged statue looked just like the figure who grabbed the sun.

“They must be the same person,” muttered Lin Yun. Golden Crows were born in the sun, but the sun was destroyed by the Golden Crow Divine Ancestor. When Lin Yun retracted his gaze, he looked down in his hand. There was a seal at the center of his palm that looked like a Golden Crow. He finally had the complete Golden Crow Seal.

In the past seven days, Lin Yun reached pinnacle mastery in Golden Crow Nine Transformations and formed the Golden Crow Seal. Naturally, his understanding of Golden Crows reached an unprecedented height.

“Perhaps I can take another step with the Divine Glorysun Fist.” Lin Yun pondered briefly before the winged human appeared behind him. Unlike the past, there was a golden crow at the center of the seal when he brought out the Divine Sun Breaking Seal.

“Indeed…” Lin Yun’s eyes were bright because he had spent the last ten days cultivating and understanding the Glorysun Spirit. With the Golden Crow Seal and Divine Sunbreaking Seal combining together, his Divine Sun Breaking Seal would reach a new level.

When Lin Yun clenched his fist, a golden brilliance manifested into a golden crow. Thousands of golden crows flew around Lin Yun, causing his aura to rise violently. The golden brilliance even dyed his body with gold as if he were a deity. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

When he threw his punch out, a hole was instantly created in the sky. At this moment, starlight shined down from the sky and enveloped the entire island. It was like the entire sky had shattered under Lin Yun’s punch.

“This is the genuine Divine Sun Breaking Seal!” Lin Yun was filled with excitement because the Glorysun Constellation Palace exponentially boosted his strength. With such a terrifying foundation, Lin Yun couldn’t imagine how powerful he would become after reaching the third soul Heavenly Soul Realm.

“If I run into Feng Xuanyi again, I should be able to fight him easily without Lil’ Red.” Lin Yun’s eyes shined brightly as he sensed a familiar aura. He then flew ten miles in the sky to arrive in front of Lil’ Red swinging the Heavenly Demonic Dipper Staff around.

“Hmm? The third soul Heavenly Soul Realm?” Lin Yun was surprised because Lil’ Red made a breakthrough after refining the Divine Firebird’s beast core and bloodline. Lil’ Red must be bothered by the fact that it couldn’t land a hit on Feng Xuanyi.

Now, Lil’ Red was standing there with a smile on its face. Under Lin Yun’s observation, he could sense that the ancient aura coming from Lil’ Red had grown denser with faint crimson flames in its eyes. It appears that Lil’ Red’s ancient bloodline had become even more powerful.

Clearly, Lil’ Red had benefited greatly from the Divine Firebird bloodline. This also made Lin Yun wonder if Lil’ Red had reached its third form. After all, Lin Yun wasn’t exactly satisfied with its fat cat or warhorse form. But if Lil’ Red chose to take a human form, it wouldn’t have any other forms.

Right at this moment, Lin Yun’s face changed because he could sense a trembling fluctuation coming from the depths of the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm. It was too far away and he could only see a blurred shadow and nothing else.

The Azure Dragon Palace? Lin Yun was surprised by the appearance of the Azure Dragon Palace.

“Lil’ Red, time to leave!” Lin Yun waved his hand before heading towards the direction of the spatial fluctuation. At this moment, Lin Yun had fully unleashed the Golden Crow Nine Transformations, ignoring the surrounding gazes.

After all, the Azure Dragon Palace represented an opportunity that even exceeded fortune. Anyone who wanted to reach the end of the Heavenly Path wouldn’t miss out on this opportunity.

Furthermore, Feng Xuanyi said that he would kill Lin Yun. So Lin Yun was really curious to find out how Feng Xuanyi was going to keep his word.

“Let’s go and see!” Lin Yun’s eyes blazed with fighting spirits.
