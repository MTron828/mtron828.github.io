Chapter 676 - Ironblood Sword Gate

Lin Yun was donned in azure clothes as he sat on top of Lil’ Red outside Skymound City. When he turned back to look at the sky-high city walls, he couldn’t help exclaiming at Luo Yu’s ability. Luo Yu actually managed to sneak him out of Skymound City under so many people’s attention. Those geniuses were probably still guarding the outside of the Falling Aquatic Residence.

But Lin Yun couldn’t waste his time with them anymore. Turning around, Lin Yun gently patted Lil’ Red’s neck to proceed.

A crimson light exploded out from the ground as Lil’ Red turned into a red streak and disappeared. Its speed was so fast that even experts in the greater Yin-Yang stage could only exclaim in admiration. Their destination was Dragonflame Hill.

Skymound City’s territory wasn’t just a city. It was a vast territory that stretched outside the city walls. Dragonflame Hill was situated in the northeast section of Skymound City. Based on the distance, it would take roughly half a month to travel there. Essentially, it could be considered Skymound City’s border since it was rather remote.

Dragonflame Hill had a legend that there was a huge battle a thousand years ago between a Flame Dragon and an expert. After the battle, the Flame Dragon’s blood covered the ground within a ten thousand mile radius. This caused many demonic beasts to start possessing the dragon bloodline. But over the last millenia, many demonic beasts with dragon bloodlines had been hunted.

However, a small portion of demonic beasts survived and grew to become unbelievably powerful. Among them was the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture, who was an overlord that no one dared to provoke. As for the outcome of that battle a millennia ago, the expert had died and the Flame Dragon’s status was uncertain. Some people said that it had died, while others claimed that it escaped with serious injuries.

Regardless, no one has seen the Flame Dragon to this day. However, the Flamedragon Hill’s legend is still passed down.

Perhaps it was because the Flame Dragon had stayed that the demonic beasts had grown unbelievably ferocious. This didn’t just apply to the overlord Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture though. The other Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beasts could also rule territories of their own.

Flamedragon Hill was extraordinary since it could give birth to many powerful demonic beasts. The chances of treasures appearing was also a lot higher. This attracted the attention of many martial cultivators to come for adventure or to hunt the demonic beasts.

There were also numerous forces near Flamedragon Hill. Among those forces, the Ironblood Sword Gate was the strongest. The Ironblood Sword Gate might not be stronger than an overlord force like the Skycloud Sect, but there was a genuine overlord in Flamedragon Hill.

Relying on Lil’ Red, Lin Yun had shortened his journey from half a month to three days. On a towering cloud that could pierce the clouds, Lin Yun stood on the peak of a mountain as he looked at the ancient mountain range before him with shock.

Before he entered Flamedragon Hill, he could sense many powerful auras in the mountain range.

As Lin Yun’s heart throbbed violently, he felt sharp pain from the Azure Dragon Mark. He could sense an exceptionally powerful aura within the mountain range. That aura should belong to the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture.

Because Lin Yun refined the Azure Dragon’s blood, he contained a wisp of dragon bloodline. So he could clearly sense an innate fear facing such a powerful demonic beast. But the pride that came from the Azure Dragon made him stand without cowering.

This made him realize that he was still too weak though. The Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture was only a mutant with a bit of dragon bloodline. The Azure Dragon’s blood that he refined came from a pureblood dragon, an overlord that grasped wind and lightning energy.

But in the eyes of the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture, he was probably no different than a worm. After all, the difference between their cultivation was too high. Regardless of the origin of the Azure Dragon, the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture was a peerless overlord beast.

“Let’s go down.” Lin Yun and Lil’ Red charged down. It didn’t take long for them to arrive outside Flamedragon Hill. While watching, he could see many cultivators come and go. Their aura was rather refined, which made sense since weaklings wouldn’t be able to survive facing the demonic beasts of Flamedragon Hill.

When he went down, he instantly attracted many people’s attention. Their eyes lit up when they saw him coming down with Lil’ Red, but nobody made a move. After all, they were experienced cultivators and they could tell that Lin Yun must either be a monstrous genius or a genius from a prestigious clan.

The type of genius he was didn’t matter to them since they could tell he wasn’t a pushover. So it didn’t take long for everyone to retract their gazes as Lin Yun entered the forest with Lil’ Red.

On his journey, he didn’t see any powerful demonic beasts at the boundary of the forest. In fact, he hardly encountered any demonic beasts. However, when he did encounter them, they weren’t even in the Yin-Yang stage. So they immediately fled the moment they saw Lil’ Red.

“Something isn’t right.” Lin Yun furrowed his brows as the forest was too abnormally quiet. Right at this moment, a powerful fluctuation rippled from what seemed to be a battle. Lin Yun patted Lil’ Red who turned into a crimson streak and headed for the battle.

“Don’t you know that this mountain has been sealed? You must be courting death since you dare to barge in!” Lin Yun stood on a tree as he watched someone kneel on the ground with grievance on his face. Around him were four disciples donned in the same uniform with a crimson sword emblem on their chest. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Keep kneeling! This is a warning to others. This is what will happen to you if you dare to offend the Ironblood Sword Gate,” said the four disciples coldly as they looked behind the kneeling figure. Their words were directed at the cultivators in the back who were wearing ugly expressions.

“Let’s go. Looks like ‘that’ person from the Ironblood Sword Gate is here.”

“Hmph, isn’t he just the young master of a sword sect in Miresword City? The Ironblood Sword Gate seals the entire Flamedragon Hill whenever he comes.”

“These bastards are too much. How many times has it been this month!”

“Shush. We can’t be offended by the Ironblood Sword Gate’s actions. Let’s go.” The cultivators who were stopped outside Flamedragon Hill began to leave despite how unwilling they felt.

“Ironblood Sword Gate...how overbearing,” muttered Lin Yun as his eyes flashed sharply.

If he remembered correctly, the Ironblood Sword Gate wasn’t exactly strong. It just had some influence in Flamedragon Hill. Aside from a secretive Supreme Elder, the sect master was only in the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm. As for its two vice-sect masters, they were only in the greater Yin-Yang stage.

But to seal the mountain? Can they really seal it? Lin Yun sneered as he landed on the ground. Lil’ Red changed directions and began galloping, breaking through the seal easily and entering Flamedragon Hill.

“It’s really different inside here.” Flamedragon Hill was filled with spiritual energy and powerful demonic beasts. Occasionally, he would find one or two fruits, but none of them could attract his attention.

In the forest, he could see the Ironblood Sword Gate’s disciples harvesting fruits. But Lin Yun couldn’t find any Yin-Yang stage disciples anywhere, which was suspicious. Where are the sect’s experts?

But Lin Yun didn’t wish to cause any trouble, so he continued his journey carefully to avoid the Ironblood Sword Gate’s disciples.

Like a butterfly in the wind, Lin Yun traveled without making any noise. Then, he landed on a high branch to determine where to go.

About a thousand meters away, he saw a bizarre flower with a fruit in it. When the fruit appeared, there was a dragon image around it emitting a crimson light.

“Flamedragon Fruit!” Looking at the bizarre fruit, Lin Yun was somewhat surprised. The Flamedragon Fruit was special in the Flamedragon Hill, and it was comparable to a fourth grade pellet. If it was refined into a pellet, it would become a powerful pellet. Then again, the effect was great even if it was eaten directly.

It was great to recover from injuries, especially internal injuries. A few hundred years ago, this fruit was rather common. The price might be high, but it wasn’t rare. But the appearance of this fruit has been decreasing recently, and anyone who could find it at Flamedragon Hill was fortunate.

“Looks like my luck is pretty good.” Lin Yun didn’t come here for this fruit, but there was no reason for him to give up since he came across one. But even after finding it, Lin Yun didn’t move immediately.

Shifting his gaze up, he soon found a lizard demonic beast that seemed to have merged with the surroundings perfectly.The only thing it revealed were its eyes that stared at the Flamedragon Fruit while crawling over slowly.

It was crawling very slowly, so it only budged a little bit after a long time had passed. If one didn’t look carefully, one wouldn’t notice the demonic beast. Looking at how cautious it was, it seemed rather patient.

But this patience wasn’t necessarily bad. After all, the satisfaction would be different the moment it ate the Flamedragon Fruit. But what if it couldn’t eat the Flamedragon Fruit?

“Lil’ Red!” Lin Yun called out on the tree branch. He wasn’t in a rush to make his move.

Practically in a split second, a crimson light streaked past and knocked the lizard who had been moving slowly for two hours. Breathing out a hot breath from its nose, Lil’ Red grinned as it glared at the lizard.

Looking at the lizard being sent flying, Lin Yun couldn’t help twitching his lips from how violent Lil’ Red was.
