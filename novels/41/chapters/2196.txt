Chapter 2197: Draw Your Sword

The terrifying space-time ripple was spread to the Profound Maiden Courtyard when the Nether Orchid Sword Array was destroyed, with the trio in the Profound Maiden Courtyard shocked by the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda. After all, the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda destroyed the time-space treasure with one strike.

“Wang Muyan…” Lin Yun muttered to himself, unable to conceal his shock when he saw the woman in the air. He had long guessed that Wang Muyan was planning something, but he never expected that she would take control of the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda. In his heart, the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda was also like the two mountains that couldn’t be moved.

The Divine Dragon Fruit in Ye Guhan’s hand fell to the ground, and he muttered, “Junior Brother, it looks like your assumption was right. That lass has given me a great shock.”

“Honestly speaking, I also didn’t expect her to create such a huge commotion,” Lin Yun bitterly smiled.

Ye Guhan took a deep breath to calm himself down, before his expression gradually became serious. He glanced in the direction of the Dao Yang Palace, which was peaceful now compared to the Nether Orchid Courtyard, and had a bad premonition. He knew that the Thousand Plume Great Saint and the other three Great Saints must’ve run into trouble…

When Ye Guhan turned to look at the Nether Orchid Courtyard, his facial expression began to change. He wasn’t an indecisive person, but he was conflicted at this moment. After a long time had passed, Ye Guhan finally made up his mind, and said, “Junior Brother, let’s go. You can’t stay here any longer.”

They had already planned beforehand that Ye Guhan would leave the Heavenly Dao Sect with Lin Yun in the worst scenario. Not only Lin Yun, but someone would also bring the Dao Yang Holy Son to safety.

“Senior Brother, if the Sword Sect is in trouble, would you leave?” Lin Yun raised his head to look at Ye Guhan. He was more stubborn than Ye Guhan at this moment, and he was like a sword, firmly standing on the ground.

Ye Guhan was silent and said nothing. It didn’t matter if he replied because they both knew that neither of them would leave if the Sword Sect was in trouble.

“But this is the Heavenly Dao Sect…” Ye Guhan said.

Lin Yun’s emotions fluctuated, before he said, “I have asked myself similar questions. I am only a passerby in the Heavenly Dao Sect, and I will always be the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple, Flower Burial Lin Yun. But I’m also the saint disciple of the Indigothunder Peak. I’ve cultivated my sword intent on the Celestial Purging Mountain, cultivated here, and participated in the Blue Dragon Record as Ye Qingtian. The two mistresses have treated me well, and my master even made a trip to the Eastern Seas for my Azure Dragon Divine Physique. So I won’t leave.”

Ye Guhan was speechless, and he didn’t know how to reply to Lin Yun.

“Senior Brother, you said that young men should do what they ought to do. I don’t know what I ought to do, but I know that I can’t leave here,” Lin Yun said.

Ye Guhan’s emotions finally fluctuated, and he asked, “Are you sure about that? Even if you know that your identity will be exposed, and you might be in danger. You still insist on staying here?”

Lin Yun said seriously, “A swordsman should have some fangs. Senior Brother, draw your sword. You don’t have to put on an act anymore. I know that you won’t leave.”

Under the moonlight, the two disciples of the Radiant Sword Saint exchanged a glance, and they both smiled. As martial brothers, they understood each other well.

“You have convinced me, and it’s true that I don't want to leave,” Ye Guhan said as he held onto his sword and reached out, “This sword’s name is Azure River.”

Lin Yun smiled as he reached out with his sword as well, “This sword is called Flower Burial.”

It looked as though they toasted glasses under the moonlight as the two swords clashed together. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“I’ll go to the Celestial Pool. Bai Shuying should be there, if I’m right,” Lin Yun said.

“I’ll go face those old goats from the Ye Clan,” Ye Guhan said.

Xin Yan, who had been silent, smiled, “What about me?”

Only then, did the two grown men realize that they were so excited that they ignored Xin Yan.

Xin Yan smiled, “Don’t look down on women. I’ll organize the fellow sisters in the Profound Maiden Courtyard. We’re all from the same sect, and I believe there will be Saint Elders who are willing to make a move.”

“Great,” Ye Guhan said. With that, Lin Yun, Ye Guhan, and Xin Yan went in different directions.

The situation was bad in the Nether Orchid Courtyard after the Ye Clan forced the Bai Clan’s Saints to the plaza. The Bai Clan’s Saints stood at the front with thousands of disciples from the Nether Orchid Courtyard behind them with pale faces as they held onto their weapons. They were pushed to a dead-end now.

In front of them were four Saint Sovereigns, ten-odd Saint Lords, and thousands of Quasi-Saints. Not to mention there was Mister Ghost who controlled the three bronze corpses, holding an overwhelming advantage in strength against the Bai Clan.

Since the fight, all the Saints were injured. The Bai Clan’s Heavenly Floral Saint Sovereign also couldn’t hold on any longer, and he had regretted not listening to the Seven Feather Saint Lord’s advice earlier. If they had used the Nether Orchid Sword Array for offence, the situation wouldn’t be as ugly as it was now, even if they had to face the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda.

Suddenly, the Ye Clan’s party split apart and the Tough Peak Saint Sovereign and Stun Yang Saint Sovereign stepped forth. The Tough Peak Saint Sovereign had a smug look on his face, and he smiled as he stroked his beard, “Bai Tianhua, are you still going to resist when it has come this far?”

The Heavenly Floral Saint Sovereign sneered while being filled with hatred for the Tough Peak Saint Sovereign. After all, many disciples of the Nether Orchid Courtyard died today. He coldly said, “Go ahead and make a move. Even in death, I will bite down a chunk of flesh from your Ye Clan!”

But the Tough Peak Saint Sovereign wasn’t bothered. Instead, he smiled, “Even if you’re not afraid, don’t you have to think for all the Nether Orchid Courtyard’s disciples behind you?”

The Heavenly Floral Saint Sovereign’s lips moved, but he wore a bitter expression. There was no precedent for a battle between Saints to involve the younger generation, but the battle today involved an entire clan’s life-and-death, so no one would follow that rule.

Seeing the Heavenly Floral Saint Sovereign’s face, the Tough Peak Saint Sovereign smiled, “We’re all from saint sects, and I don’t want to take it too far. I give you a chance to let those behind you go.”

“Ancestor, don’t listen to him!” The Bai Clan’s Saints spoke out, unwilling to give up.

“What’s your condition?” The Heavenly Floral Saint Sovereign asked.

The Tough Peak Saint Sovereign didn’t speak, but the Stun Yang Saint Sovereign spoke out with a smile, “Simple, the Bai Clan’s Saints have to cripple their cultivations, then we can let everyone behind you go.”

“You’re shameless!” Everyone from the Bai Clan was dumbfounded because the Tough Peak Saint Sovereign’s condition was too shameless.

“Shameless?” The Tough Peak Saint Sovereign dropped his smile, and said, “The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint isn’t here, so who do you think you are to talk about conditions with me? Or do you think that you can still jump around? Bai Tianhua, you should know that me and my son haven’t made a move in the fight earlier.”

The Heavenly Floral Saint Sovereign felt bitter in his heart. He knew that the Bai Clan already couldn’t hold on any longer when there were still two Saint Sovereigns from the other side who hadn’t made a move. The three bronze corpses weren’t something a Saint Lord could stop, and their bodies were even tougher than Glory Saint Artifacts.

Amongst the Bai Clan’s Saint Lords, there were less than six who could still fight. The others were heavily injured, and it would be a question of whether they could ensure their safety, not to mention joining the fight.

The Heavenly Floral Saint Sovereign could naturally leave with his cultivation as a Saint Sovereign, but the Bai Clan would be finished if he did.

Right then, saint radiances streaked across the sky as eight Saints landed before the Bai Clan. The one leading was the Azure Spirit Saint Sovereign, the ancestor of the Zhang Clan. He looked dignified with saint runes enveloping around him that made him look as though he had fused into the space.

Those from the Nether Orchid Courtyard rejoiced because the Holy Spirit Courtyard’s reinforcements finally came.

“Tough Peak Saint Sovereign, don’t take it too far. You have already won. There’s no need to push it. After we leave, you can have the Heavenly Dao Sect all you want,” the Azure Spirit Saint Sovereign said.

.

“Well said. Do you know how many people from the Bai Clan died today? Even if I spare him, will he not come after me in the future?” The Tough Peak Saint Sovereign sneered.

“Since that’s the case, my Zhang Clan won’t stand by and watch,” the Azure Spirit Saint Sovereign said. The Zhang Clan could continue to watch from the Holy Spirit Clan if the Nether Orchid Courtyard was breached, but if they didn’t stand out when the Bai Clan was forced to a dead-end, they would probably be next after the Bai Clan.

The Tough Peak Saint Sovereign sneered, “I have long expected that the Zhang Clan would stand out. Do you think that I came with no preparations? I advise you to get lost now while you can still preserve your Zhang Clan. Otherwise… just the few of you aren’t enough!”

The Tough Peak Saint Sovereign was arrogant. He had made preparations in case the Zhang Clan reinforced the Bai Clan. According to the Gale Rein Great Saint, they still had reinforcements that could come over any time. So the Tough Peak Saint Sovereign wasn’t afraid at all.

“They’re not enough? What about me?” A voice resounded as Ye Guhan arrived. He was in the corner chewing on the Divine Dragon Fruit, wearing a smile as he looked at everyone from the Ye Clan who had shock on their faces. Even if Ye Guhan was unwilling to face the Ye Clan, he had ultimately chosen to step out.

“Ye Guhan, you traitor! Not only did you not help the Ye Clan, but you even stood with the enemies!” The Tough Peak Saint Sovereign was furious because the Ye Clan had two traitors, Ye Qianyu and Ye Guhan. But there was nothing he could do to those two because they were talented, and the Ye Clan would have been able to suppress the other three clans if those two stood on his side.

Ye Guhan didn’t argue with the Tough Peak Saint Sovereign, but said, “Ancestor, have you ever wondered why the Thousand Plume Great Saint and I didn’t stand on your side?”

Before the Tough Peak Saint Sovereign could reply, Ye Guhan smiled, “That’s because you’re unworthy, you old goat!”

“You’re a mere Saint Sovereign. You’re no different from an ant trying to topple a tree,” Mister Ghost sneered as he stood on one of the bronze corpses with contempt in his eyes.

Ye Guhan smiled, and a terrifying saint aura swept out from him, surpassing everyone present. “A Saint Sovereign? That was already an old story!”

Following Ye Guhan’s words, he swung his sword that lit up the entire region like a bright sun.
