Chapter 816 - Clouds and the Moon

Was the flash a secret technique similar to the Aurora Dragon’s Eyes? Was that flash sword intent? Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts. Lin Yun realized that Fang Hanluo wasn’t simple since he couldn’t see through the latter.

Clearly, Fang Hanluo must have felt the danger from Wu Xiaotian’s attack and used one of his trump cards. Others might not be able to notice it, but as a swordsman, Lin Yun could clearly see it.

His Aurora Dragon’s Eyes and sword intent could see through his opponent’s flaws. One was his part of his innate talent while the other was obtained through tempering. It was similar to how an aerial demonic beast could fly through the air, but it still had to train to become strong.

The Aurora Dragon’s Eyes didn’t just allow him to see through everything, but it also allowed him to observe spiritual energy, differentiate illusions, and enhance his eyesight. Wu Xiaotian’s loss benefited Lin Yun greatly.

“Fang Hanluo’s dragon projection actually evolved into a Four-clawed Golden Dragon.”

“Since it has four claws, it will probably have the ability to grow to five claws. After all, having five claws and nine feet is the symbol of supremacy!”

“Now that you mention it, the champion will probably be able to obtain a monarch dragon. Refining that dragon aura would be incredible.”

“The battle between the three kings will be intense. After all, the dragon aura will affect their strength greatly.”

“The show has just started!” Everyone paid close attention to Fang Hanluo’s dragon projection.

“Have the ants finally realized the true benefit of coming in first?” Yu Haotian’s eyes flickered with disdain. In his eyes, he could easily crush everyone.

Yan Long’zi’s eyes were impassioned as he possessed a wisp of the Flame Dragon’s bloodline. Dragon aura was extremely important to him, so he had to come in first. Even Zhao Wuji, who had been low-profile, also had excitement in his eyes. All candidates for the top ten became spirited when they saw the results of the first fight.

Suddenly, the judge made his next announcement, “Next battle, Yue Weiwei VS Jiang Ziye!”

The judge’s announcement created an uproar. There were only two women in the top ten, who were very accomplished. Additionally, Yue Weiwei was extremely popular because of her beauty. She was a gorgeous lady who couldn’t be messed with or else she would unleash her wrath like she did to Qing Ruoyou.

As for Jiang Ziye, she was just as beautiful as Yue Weiwei, but her temperament was entirely different. She behaved like a hero and a lady. Clearly, these weren’t women that anyone could casually approach.

Yue Weiwei and Jiang Ziye were very similar to each other. Yue Weiwei had a close relationship with Lin Yun while Jiang Ziye had an ambiguous attitude towards Wu Xiaotian. It was hard for anyone to understand what these ladies were thinking. On top of that, both women were strong and their grace suppressed many men.

“Jiang Ziye against Yue Weiwei? I wonder who will win?”

“No one is able to see through Yue Weiwei. It’s almost like this banquet is just a game to her.”

“Jiang Ziye, on the other hand, is more serious. But no one knows how strong he is. I heard that she once exchanged over a hundred moves with Yan Long’zi.”

“Hehe, why are you guys being so serious? Just enjoy the battle. Neither of them will disappoint us.”

“That’s right. This fight is more interesting than Yue Weiwei’s fight with Qing Ruoyou.” The excitement of the crowd was a lot higher than it was during the first fight. Even Lin Yun was interested because he might finally get to see some of Yue Weiwei’s true strength. As of this moment, all he knew was that Yue Weiwei was from the same ‘bigger world’ that Su Ziyao, Drifting Goblet, and Li Wuyou came from.

However, he didn’t understand her objective. Yue Weiwei said she came here to run away from an arranged wedding, but Lin Yun didn’t believe her. Perhaps her true reason for coming was for the mysterious path he saw in the starry sky.

Jiang Ziye smiled and said, “Please go easy on me, Younger Sister Weiwei. I’m not good at dancing.”

Jiang Ziye lowered her attitude when she spoke. Although they fought before, neither of them used their full strength to avoid revealing their trump cards. However, they were fighting for their rankings now, so a brutal fight was inevitable.

“That depends on whether or not big sister is obedient.” Yue Weiwei chuckled.

“Sorry, but I’m not.” Jiang Ziye smiled and attacked first.

Sensing the pressure coming from Jiang Ziye, Yue Weiwei didn’t dare to be careless and swung her flute. In the blink of an eye, the flute appeared in front of Jiang Ziye as music filled the air.

“Cloud Descending Hand!” Jiang Ziye reached out with her hand to counterattack. The clouds began to roll in the sky and an unbelievable suction force came from Jiang Ziye’s attack.

Yue Wewei’s face changed as explosions filled the air. She quickly retreated, but all of her afterimages were sucked into Jiang Ziye’s hands.

This scene made everyone hold their breath because a normal person would have been captured. After all, Jiang Ziye had brought her cloud intent to an unfathomable level.

“Cut!” Seeing that her counterattack was useless, Yue Weiwei spun in mid-air like a blooming peony that made everything look dull. Using her jade flute, she created a red arch that flew towards Jiang Ziye. When the red arch descended, a dazzling red brilliance enveloped the entire stage.

“Gather!” Jiang Ziye didn’t dare to be careless and started to gather many clouds around her. After the clouds gathered together, purple lightning began to flicker around her. “Lightning Cloudburst!”

“Break!” A bolt of lightning descended and the arch made of red light was torn to pieces.

“Big sister, you’re not obedient at all!” Yue Weiwei grumbled after she was knocked into the air. After recovering in mid-air, she used her jade flute as a sword and attacked. Her attacks were gradually becoming ferocious, showing everyone that she had deep attainments in sword techniques.

However, Jiang Ziye was even more shocking. Her cloud intent was so terrifying that she could manipulate the clouds to manifest rain, fog, lightning, and wind. These phenomena even corresponded to her martial techniques.

“Rising Moon!” Jiang Ziye suddenly slapped the air and a moon descended from the sky of boundless clouds. Immediately, Yue Weiwei was sent flying.

After flying a bit in the air, Yue Weiwei placed the jade flute by her lips and celestial music rang out. Her hair began to flutter in the wind as she played her music.

“Heavenly Imprisoning Finger!” A shocking scene appeared as a gigantic finger tore apart the clouds. In the next second, a series of explosions sounded out as Yue Weiwei’s flute music dissipated.

“I give up. Big sister, you won.” Yue Weiwei sighed as she pouted her lips.

“Thank you for letting me win.” Jiang Ziye smiled. She could sense that Yue Weiwei didn’t give it her all.

“Hehe, big sister is pretty obedient.” The sorrow instantly disappeared on Yue Weiwei’s face and was replaced by a smile.

Jiang Ziye had won this battle, but Yue Weiwei wasn’t bothered by the loss. Instead, it looked like she enjoyed the process of battle.

Lin Yun fell into deep thought after the battle. Others might only be able to see that Yue Weiwei combined her music and sword technique together, but Lin Yun saw 108 sword techniques. If every single sword technique was unleashed, it wouldn’t be any weaker than the Overlord Sword. However, Yue Weiwei’s attainment in the sword wasn’t high enough.

“This big sister is interesting…” Fang Hanluo was also shocked.

“Next battle, Bai Lixuan VS Zhao Wuji!” The judge’s announcement created an uproar because one of the three kings was finally going to fight. Zhao Wuji, who kept a low profile the whole time, was finally going to show off his strength. This would be the first battle between a dark horse and a king.
