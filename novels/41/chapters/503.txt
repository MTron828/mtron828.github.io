Chapter 504 - Lin Yun Returns!

The depths of the Bloodbone Mountain Range were a mess from the fight between the two demonic beasts, the Indigo Thunderpython and Dragon Blooded Horse. At the moment, Lil’ Red had returned to its horse form and was covered in injuries. Its aura had also been greatly weakened. But it was still holding on, waiting for Lin Yun’s return. Whenever it had a chance, Lil’ Red would take a bite at the python by relying on its speed.

The Indigo Thunderpython was still ferocious, but its tail was covered with injuries. A small section of it had been snapped by the Dragon Blooded Horse’s jaw, so one could imagine how furious it must be right now. But it was a pity that Lil’ Red was simply too fast for it to catch.

“This fool…” Lin Yun smiled when he saw this scene. He never imagined that Lil’ Red could force the Indigo Thunderpython this far and that it could even bite off a small section of its tail. If it wasn’t for him, Lil’ Red probably would have run away already.

When he raised his head to look at the python, it was a lot weaker than before. After all, it left the lake and was covered with injuries.

“Let’s end this,” said Lin Yun as he released his xiantian sword intent. A sword buzz rang out and the surrounding trees began to crumble. At the same time, the Indigo Thunderpython that was chasing after Lil’ Red instantly turned around to look at Lin Yun. Letting out a roar, the python released its demonic aura and pounced at Lin Yun.

“It really does know how to hold a grudge,” smirked Lin Yun. Did the python still think that he was a pushover? Just thinking about how he was being chased by the python in the lake filled him with rage.

In his dantian, a silver Iris Flower bloomed and his origin energy began to surge violently through his meridians. Simultaneously, his aura in the Violet Palace Realm was released from his body to instantly crush the python’s demonic aura.

Lin Yun had undergone a transformation, so the python that was charging over was sent flying. It was startled by Lin Yun’s aura and it didn’t hesitate to turn around to escape back into the lake.

“You want to run now? Too late…” Lin Yun barked as he held onto the Flower Burial Sword. The sky instantly turned dark as lightning flickered in the cloud.

Overlord Sword—Thunderbolt Slash!

Lin Yun drew his sword and a bolt of lightning flashed through the horizon, severing the python that was trying to escape into two. Then, Lin Yun sheathed his sword. When he landed on the ground, the python’s corpse fell onto the ground and created a tremor.

Lin Yun waved his hand to retrieve the beast core. The beast core was indigo and Lin Yun could sense a flame within its depths. At the same time, the beast core was releasing a shocking overlord pressure.

The spiritual energy contained in it was shocking. But Lin Yun had just reached the Violet Palace Realm, so he had no need for resources right now. He then turned to look at Lil’ Red, who was staring at him.

“Here,” smiled Lin Yun as he threw the beast core over to Lil’ Red. In addition to the beast core, the other parts of the python were also considered treasures. The scales contained pure fire energy that could provide shocking defence. If it was used to make armor, it could definitely be sold for a high price.

The snake gall would also fetch a nice price. As for the flesh, it was considered a delicacy so it held a lot of value. But the most valuable one was the horn because it actually contained lightning energy. It could control lightning attributed spiritual energy and it could be fashioned into a spear.

After Lin Yun gathered the materials, he sat on the ground. Lil’ Red was currently refining the beast core and its aura was slowly being strengthened with signs of making a breakthrough. After all, the Indigo Thunderpython was an overlord demonic beast in the greater Yin stage. It had lived for centuries, so its beast core was definitely a great treasure that could aid in making a breakthrough.

“I wonder how Liu Yunyan and the rest…” Lin Yun took out an Indigoflame Goldlotus and he played with it in his hand. They probably thought that he was dead. Liu Yunyan was still fine, but Bai Yi was probably heartbroken. He had to catch up to them quickly. After all, it would be troublesome if they got on the boat without him. He had promised Liu Yunyan that he would bring her the lotuses.

Then again, it wouldn’t be a huge problem because he could catch up to them easily with Lil’ Red. With that, night slowly passed.

There was a group of people traveling through the forest with downcast faces. The one leading the group was a woman with a cold face. She was naturally Liu Yunyan.

“Senior Sister, that was where we camped the first day…” A girl beside her suddenly pointed at the camp up ahead. This meant that it wouldn’t take long for them to leave the Bloodbone Mountain Range.

Thinking about how she was going to return empty-handed, Liu Yunyan couldn’t help but be disappointed. She couldn’t help thinking about how Lin Yun punished Lu Siyin that night. Lin Yun was ruthless and he had no concern that Lu Siyin was a woman. But he…

Liu Yunyan shook her head. She couldn’t understand Lin Yun’s actions. He clearly knew that it would be perilous, but he still went after the lotuses. When she turned her head, she saw Bai Yi staring at the camp in a daze. Liu Yunyan’s expression softened and she said, “Lass, don’t think about it too much…”

Bai Yi must be thinking about Lin Yun right now, but Lin Yun was already dead. Thinking too much about it was torturous and would make her feel even worse.

“Senior Sister, do you think Big Brother Lin will return?” asked Bai Yi. Her words stunned Liu Yunyan. With a bitter smile, she stayed silent because she had no idea how to reply. The other Heavenly Province Academy’s disciples also wore an unsightly face.

They were filled with admiration for Lin Yun, but no one believed that Lin Yun could make it back. After all, this was the Indigo Thunderpython they were talking about…

“Senior Sister, I believe that Big Brother Lin will definitely come back,” smiled Bai Yi.

“You silly lass,” smiled Liu Yunyan with gentleness in her eyes.

“I’m not being silly. I just know that Big Brother Lin will come back,” said Bai Yi stubbornly.

“Oh? Interesting… You Heavenly Province Academy still believes that Flower Burial is still alive?” Three figures suddenly appeared before the Heavenly Province Academy’s party. They were Pan Yue, Han Fei, and Ye Cangming. Behind them were the disciples of the Bloodwing Pavilion and Threesolute Manor that were currently eyeing the Heavenly Province Academy’s party.

“Pan Yue!” The Heavenly Province Academy’s party instantly became alert.

Liu Yunyan pulled Bai Yi behind her and asked, “What’s the meaning of this?” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Nothing much. Lin Yun made us lose the Indigoflame Goldlotuses, so we naturally have to resolve this issue,” said Ye Cangming with a sinister smile.

“Since when did the Threesolute Manor and Bloodwing Pavilion stoop so low as to work with a wandering cultivator?” questioned Liu Yunyan.

“Liu Yunyan, cut the crap. If it wasn’t for Lin Yun, we wouldn’t have suffered such a great loss. Leave behind all your interspatial pouches or else none of you can leave here today,” said Han Fei.

“Dream on!” Liu Yunyan began to release her killing aura.

“Liu Yunyan, I advise you to think carefully. Look at your surroundings before making your decision,” said Pan Yue with a fake smile on his lips.

When the Heavenly Province Academy’s disciples looked around, they could see countless crimson eyes staring at them. They exclaimed, “The Draconian Rockrats!”

“Them again! Damn it, the Bloodwing Pavilion really was the mastermind that day!” The Heavenly Province Academy’s faces changed. “Senior Sister, let’s fight them. They’re acting too cocky!”

Liu Yunyan was also shocked when she saw the Draconian Rockrats because the Bloodwing Pavilion actually used the same trick again.

“Liu Yunyan, do you understand your current straits now? Who knows if you will die today,” smiled Pan Yue.

“Cut the crap. My patience is limited,” said Ye Cangming as he frowned his eyebrows out of annoyance.

With that, the Bloodwing Pavilion and Threesolute Manor’s disciples drew their weapons and they took several steps forward. At the same time, the Draconian Rockrats also released a ferocious roar. They had planned everything well, so there was nothing the Heavenly Province academy could do even if they wanted to retaliate.

“Since I’m the cause of your anger, why are you looking for others? Just come and look for me, Flower Burial.” A cold voice suddenly sounded out right at this moment.

Pan Yue, Ye Cangming, and Han Fei were stunned as they followed the source of the voice. They saw a youth riding on a crimson horse that was slowly approaching. He carried a sword box on his back and wore a purple mark on his forehead that made him look demonic. He was naturally Lin Yun.

“Impossible!” The three of them exclaimed as they were deeply shocked.
