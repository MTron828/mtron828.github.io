Chapter 1060 - Land of the Battle of Gods

The flames on the gate slowly extinguished, which meant that the entrance to the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm was closed. All those who were still in the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm were trapped.

The Nether Divinity Realm Son silently watched as the gate closed.

“Young Master, Lin Yun definitely died in the forbidden region. His journey in Heavenly Path has come to an end, so he will no longer pose any threat to you,” said one of the war realm’s servants.

The Nether Divinity Realm Son locked his brows together and muttered, “He has the Azure Dragon True Bone, so I have a feeling that he won’t die in there.”

“So what? Even if he makes it out of the forbidden region, there’s no way he can leave the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm. Furthermore, if he ended up in the forbidden region, the Azure Dragon True Bone won’t be able to save him,” smiled the Profound Dragon Realm Son.

The Elysium Trigram Realm Son was in a pretty good mood now that Lin Yun was in a dangerous situation. Unlike the Profound Dragon Realm Son, he knew that the Nether Divinity Realm Son was concerned about Yue Weiwei’s life, not Lin Yun’s life. Unfortunately for the Nether Divinity Realm Son, Yue Weiwei’s feelings were too deep for Lin Yun. After all, she entered the forbidden region with Lin Yun.

Now, the Nether Divinity Realm Son had a thorn in his heart. As a prideful person, he couldn’t accept that he lost to someone from a lower realm.

“Lin Yun is dead!” The Nether Divinity Realm Son said with his booming voice. “From now on, Lin Yun is no more! This is the outcome of anyone who challenges the Nether Divinity War Realm!”

His voice was indifferent as he declared his victory. In this way, he let everyone know that he was superior to Lin Yun. Although there were people filled with disdain for the Nether Divinity Realm Son, no one dared to reveal their displeasure. After all, Lin Yun’s outcome had already proven that the war realms couldn’t be provoked. Despite Lin Yun’s strength, his outcome was death.

The Nether Divinity Realm Son smiled because he was ultimately the last one standing. It was just a shame that Yue Weiwei was gone. Then again, there were plenty of women in Kunlun Realm. As for the slap Lin Yun had given him, it no longer mattered to him.

The Nether Divinity Realm Son adjusted his perspective and glanced at the altar before leaving. Lin Yun could only blame the fact that he came from the lower realms.

The forbidden region was a lot more perilous than Lin Yun had imagined, so he felt his vitality draining away. However, his intuition was correct. The Azure Dragon True Bone reacted when he entered the forbidden region as a faint dragon energy emitted out of the true bone. The dragon energy enveloped Lil’ Red and Yue Weiwei as well. Although their vitality was being sapped away every single moment, the speed of its disappearance was much slower than before.

If Lin Yun didn’t have the Azure Dragon True Bone, he probably would have died after an hour. Then again, that didn’t mean that he was completely safe now. After all, he only unlocked the first layer of the Azure Dragon True Bone. If he stayed here for too long, death was imminent.

“The entrance seems to have disappeared…” Yue Weiwei muttered, but she didn’t dare to look at Lin Yun.

“It has.” Lin Yun replied. He could sense the fluctuation outside, which was well within his expectations. He already knew that the entrance would close before he came in, but they didn’t have any other choice. He also wouldn’t come here if there were alternatives.

“Let’s go. They're probably gone now.” Lin Yun didn’t want to stay in this forbidden region for too long now that the Realm Sons were gone. It was probably safe outside, so he could give the Azure Dragon Palace a try.

Lin Yun was hopeful for the Azure Dragon Palace. After all, he had obtained the inheritance there that also doubled as the Azure Dragon Lord’s acknowledgement. If he could get to the palace, the palace spirit might be able to help. However, Lin Yun underestimated the forbidden region as he couldn’t find the exit.

Just like that, they were trapped in the forbidden region. At this moment, Yue Weiwei coughed and threw up a mouthful of blood. Her face was pale from all the injuries and blood that she was losing.

“Let me take a look at your injuries.” Lin Yun locked his brows together because he knew for a while that Yue Weiwei was injured. Additionally, he could sense that her origin energy was sealed. She was no different from an ordinary person right now. He didn’t say anything earlier because they were fleeing for their lives, but now he could.

“This is a forbidden region. There will be consequences if you use origin energy,” said Yue Weiwei while looking around. She could sense a mysterious aura flowing around in the atmosphere.

“It’s fine.” Lin Yun wasn’t bothered by her words and lifted her off of Lil’ Red. He then locked his brows as he examined her injuries. Yue Weiwei’s injuries weren’t serious, but the seal on her body was extremely vicious. The Nether Divinity Realm Son left behind several fine needles within her body that made up a few seals. Everytime she activated her origin energy, the seals would release a poison. The poison would give her unimaginable pain. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

There were thousands of needles that would squirm as soon as she used her origin energy. Since she used her origin energy before, she had damage on her meridians. Lin Yun couldn’t begin to imagine what kind of suffering Yue Weiwei went through.

“Nether Divinity Realm Son!” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with a cold killing aura. If he knew this, he would’ve killed the Nether Divinity Realm Son even if it meant sacrificing himself.

“Bear with it a little.” Lin Yun sucked in a cold breath. The needles might be problematic for others, but he had the sky sword intent. It was easy to shatter the needles as long as one could bear the pain.

“Don’t worry about it, Big Brother Yun. I can wait.” Yue Weiwei smiled.

“You’re in this state, but you’re still smiling…” said Lin Yun. He couldn’t believe her attitude with the suffering she went through.

“It doesn’t hurt as long as I’m with you.” Yue Weiwei chuckled as her eyes narrowed into slits.

Looking at Yue Weiwei, Lin Yun decided to get started, “Here we go.”

Placing a palm on Yue Weiwei’s back, Lin Yun’s sword intent flowed into Yue Weiwei’s body. When his sky sword intent poured into Yue Weiwei’s meridians, her face became distorted from the pain. Her meridians were getting damaged a little despite Lin Yun’s precise control.

However, the pain didn’t last long at all. The needles were quickly destroyed by Lin Yun. Then, he meticulously spent his origin energy searching every corner of Yue Weiwei’s body for needles.

“I’m fine now, Big Brother Yun.” It didn’t take long for Yue Weiwei to blush because this was the first time they had such an intimate interaction. Allowing Lin Yun’s sword intent to flow throughout her body was the same as letting Lin Yun see her entire body.

Lin Yun soon woke up. He found a seal in Yue Weiwei’s body, but it didn’t seem to bring any harm to her. Instead, it seemed like it sealed her cultivation. After extracting his sword intent from Yue Weiwei’s body, the latter suddenly felt powerless and muttered weakly, “Big Brother Lin, I’m tired.”

“Rest well.” Lin Yun placed Yue Weiwei on Lil’ Red. He wanted her to lay down because she needed as much rest as she could get. The next time she woke up, she would be able to recover from her injuries.

After Yue Weiwei fell asleep, Lin Yun and Lil’ Red traveled through the forbidden region. They cautiously walked with the feeling that something would appear out of the mist at any moment. Since they couldn’t find the way back, they had no choice but to keep walking forward.

Suddenly, a familiar humming noise rang in the distance that made Lin Yun’s face change. He could sense a familiar sword intent that wasn’t here before. He had a feeling that someone was trying to lure him over. “Is that?!”

After a long hesitation, the humming noise became even sharper than before.

“Let’s go and take a look.” Lin Yun maintained his caution as he headed towards the sword intent. An hour later, a rusty sword appeared in his vision. It was a plain and simple sword. The sword was piercing the forehead of a corpse with Lin Yun’s sword intent.

Lin Yun found Yu Haotian’s body, which brought back memories. Even though Yu Haotian was dead, he remembered that he threw the sword to ensure that the former wouldn’t appear ever again. Luckily for Lin Yun, he killed Yu Haotian before the latter got to the depths of the forbidden region.

“This is the Land of the Battle of Gods,” said Yue Weiwei with a grave expression after waking up.
