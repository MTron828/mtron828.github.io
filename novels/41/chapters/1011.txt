When Mo Xuan flicked his finger, a lightning rumble echoed out as a bolt of lightning streaked across the horizon. At that moment, the terrifying sword aura charged into the sky as his sword aura manifested into purple lightning.

Up until now, no one managed to block this attack, not even a leader of a higher realm like Zheng Rong. So naturally, everyone was worried that Lin Yun would be killed.

As a genius from a war realm, Mo Xuan had domineeringly displayed his strength. Shockingly, Lin Yun wasn’t moving to face Mo Xuan’s devastating attack.

“What is he doing?”

“He’s probably too stunned to move. Although Zheng Rong died, he still managed to execute a monarch fortune martial technique. I bet this person can’t even tell how strong Mo Xuan’s finger is.”

“He’s really courting death. Why did he have to stand up for her?” A discussion broke out among the crowd when they saw this scene. They began to shake their heads because Lin Yun put himself in this position. He was basically an idiot.

Mo Xuan’s face was full of ridicule. In his view, Lin Yun couldn’t even see how strong his attack was. He initially thought that Lin Yun would be somewhat troublesome to deal with, but he never expected that Lin Yun would just stand there.

Suddenly, something strange occurred. Lin Yun raised his arm and lightning started to flicker in the center of his palms. Then, a dazzling strand of lightning furiously circulated in his palm. As the strand revolved, it began to release a powerful sword intent that brightly lit everything in a ten mile radius.

“Sword aura as fine as silk!”

“Is that the attack of the Profound Lightning Twin Swords? I get it!” Everyone’s faces changed upon seeing the light in Lin Yun’s palm. They finally realized how the Profound Lightning Twin Swords attacked. It was a brilliant means that could catch others by surprise, but it could only be accomplished with great attainments in the sword.

But what left them even more shocked was the fact that Lin Yun was actually able to grab the invisible sword silk. It was quite a scene to watch Mo Xuan’s attack fail.

“How did he manage to do it?”

“This is too unbelievable!” War realms were known as forbidden existences, but Lin Yun was capable of taking their attack. It was like he broke all logic.

Compared to others, Mo Xuan was even more shocked because he had clearly never expected this scene.

“Here, you can have it back.” Lin Yun flicked his finger and returned the sword silk along with boundless sword aura back to Mo Xuan.

Looking at this scene, Mo Xuan and Han Lei’s faces changed because they knew how powerful the sword silk was, not to mention that it was being returned with even more sword aura. So without any hesitation, the two of them retreated. However, they were one step too slow and the lightning cocoon exploded, forcing them to draw their swords.

In the process, the ground cracked while Mo Xuan and Han Lei were enveloped in a cloud of dust. Their faces sank because of their pride as geniuses from the Elysium Trigram War Realm. Up until now, they had never suffered such a terrible loss.

Han Lei squinted his eyes and looked at the disguised Pei Xue before he asked, “You’re determined to protect her?”

“At least you’re not stupid,” replied Lin Yun. In the end, he couldn’t watch Pei Xue get humiliated before his eyes. It didn’t matter if Pei Xue had a grudge with Yue Weiwei. She gave Lin Yun a reminder when he was facing the Demonic Astral Flowers, which saved his life.

Even with his current cultivation, it wasn’t easy for him to face the Demonic Astral Flowers. Furthermore, Pei Xue didn’t make things difficult for him in the Azure Dragon Plaza.

“You’re the first person who dares to protect someone that the Elysium Trigram War Realm wants to kill,” said Han Lei while he looked at Lin Yun.

“I’ve long heard that the Ten War Realms were forbidden existences transcending all the other realms. But the two of you can’t scare me if this is the limit to your strength,” replied Lin Yun in an indifferent tone. He naturally knew that the war realms weren’t pushovers, but he also couldn’t watch anything happen to Pei Xue. That would go against his heart as a swordsman. If that happened, he would never be able to raise his head when facing the Ten War Realms in the future.

The Yellow Sandy Plain fell silent from Lin Yun’s words. Everyone looked at him with deep shock. They couldn’t believe that Lin Yun actually wanted to protect someone that the war realms wanted to kill.

The disguised Pei Xue was also shocked that Lin Yun was protecting her. She never would have expected him to do so.

“Kill him!” Han Lei no longer hesitated after receiving Lin Yun’s reply. Mo Xuan was also out of patience as lightning runes blazed in his aura oceans. In the next second, his boundless origin energy started pouring into his sword as a terrifying storm swept out.

But Lin Yun wasn’t afraid and took a step forward. He unleashed an even more boundless sword aura with his azure dragon sword aura and sky sword intent combined. When he opened his hand, the Divine Sun Breaking Seal bloomed in his palm as he threw an attack towards Mo Xuan.

Mo Xuan’s eyes flashed coldly as countless little lightning bolts started to surge out of his body. Then, he clashed with Lin Yun’s golden fist. When the attacks collided, a shockwave started to rip apart the surrounding space.

When the lightning and golden light clashed together, Lin Yun and Mo Xuan took several steps back. The audience was shocked because they didn’t think that Lin Yun could face a serious Mo Xuan. Somehow, Lin Yun was evenly matched with Mo Xuan. At this moment, the crowd began to wonder who Lin Yun was.
