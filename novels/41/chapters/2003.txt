Chapter 2004 - Blood Crow Tribe

After incinerating the Indigocloth Venerable, Lin Yun restored Ye Qingtian’s appearance. When he returned, Bai Qingyu woke up and saw that Lin Yun had retrieved the Stalewater Sword from the tree and handed it back to her. Lin Yun had suffered greatly under that sword, and Xiao Jingyan wouldn’t have been so terrifying if it wasn’t for the help of this sword.

“Ye Qingtian, thank you for retrieving this sword given to me by my elder sister. She’ll be heartbroken if I lose it.” Bai Qingyu received the Stalewater Sword. She was nervous and didn’t dare to look Ye Qingtian in the eyes.

“Xiao Jingyan and the rest are dead?”

“They’re dead. Don’t move. Let me examine your injuries.” Lin Yun circulated his nirvana aura before sending it into Bai Qingyu’s body. He then exclaimed in shock, “Bai Qingyu, how did your injuries become so severe?”

He finally realized that Bai Qingyu wasn’t fooling around when she said she was dying. Her dragon pulses were almost destroyed. Even with the help of saint pellets, they could only temporarily suppress her injuries. Dragon pulses were the core of Nirvana Stage experts and were even more important than their meridians.

Lin Yun also suffered injuries to his dragon pulses in the past, and he was practically reduced to a cripple. He could only rely on his music dao and physique to last through that tough period, and it wasn’t easy for him to restore his dragon pulses.

Bai Qingyu didn’t have two saint physiques like him. So she might not be able to repair her dragon pulses even with the help of the Heavenly Snow Lotus. Bai Qingyu’s emotions collapsed upon hearing that, and she cried out, “Ye Qingtian, I’m sorry. I’m too useless and have caused trouble for you instead. Now, I’m even a burden to you.”

“Ha, at least you have some self-awareness.”

Lil’ Red invited Lil' Purple out of the Iris Secret Realm.

“Who are you?” Bai Qingyu asked, still sobbing.

“She’s Lord Phoenix,” Lil’ Red said.

Bai Qingyu’s eyes lit up when she heard Lil' Red’s words. The Lord Phoenix was beautiful, but she looked like a little girl.

“Her injuries?” Lin Yun turned to look at Lil’ Purple.

“Nothing serious. If I didn’t make a mistake, she also has a natal Saint Physique. She didn’t cultivate properly, so it hasn’t awakened. But her potential isn’t weak,” Lil’ Purple said.

Lin Yun already had a speculation. If she had no potential, she wouldn’t have such a powerful cultivation at such a young age.

“My elder sister possesses the Natal Yang Saint Physique, while I possess the Natal Yin Saint Physique. But my talent can’t be compared to my elder sister, and I also dislike cultivating. That’s why my saint physique hasn’t been awakened,” Bai Qingyu said softly with her head lowered.

“That’s not necessarily true,” Lil’ Purple said in a playful tone.

“Mhm?” Bai Qingyu looked at Lil’ Purple in puzzlement, but Lil’ Purple didn’t say much about it.

“Her injuries aren’t as serious as yours were, and it’s not hard to recover from them,” Lil’ Purple said. “Refining the Heavenly Snow Lotus without a Divine Dragon Bone will be more troublesome. She needs to bathe in the Heavenly Snow Elixir while you refine the Snow Lotus Heart with your Divine Dragon Bone and inject it into her.”

“I still have some Snow Lotus Heart, but what do you mean by me refining it and injecting it into her?” Lin Yun asked in puzzlement.

“Are you stupid? Feed it to her, obviously,” Lil’ Purple said.

“What?” Bai Qingyu’s face blushed as she lowered her head.

“Is that really necessary?” Lin Yun frowned. He wasn’t too willing to do that.

“Well, I can’t do anything about that. She didn’t awaken her saint physique nor does she have a Divine Dragon Bone. So she can only be a cripple now. At that time, her elder sister will surely kill you,” Lil’ Purple said.

“Ye Qingtian, I believe that you’re a good person. I don’t wish to be a cripple. I’ve done many wrong things, so allow me to repay you,” Bai Qingyu said, raising her head. Who would want to become a cripple if they could choose? Not to mention she was a genius in the past.

“Don’t regret it,” Lin Yun said, recalling his past experience.

Bai Qingyu heaved a breath of relief. She wasn’t afraid and even had a little anticipation.

Not long later, Lil’ Purple set up a bath for them and poured the Heavenly Snow Elixir she had refined into it. Lin Yun noticed that Lil’ Purple secretly cut her hand and dripped a few droplets of blood into the bath.

When they both entered, their palms were connected as Lin Yun swallowed the Snow Lotus Heart before pouring the Blue Dragon Bone’s aura into Bai Qingyu’s body.

Half an incense later, Lin Yun gathered the refined Snow Lotus Heart in his mouth. He said, “Open your mouth.”

Bai Qingyu mustered her courage and opened her mouth. The Snow Lotus Heart then entered her body and melted the moment it entered her mouth. Throughout this process, Bai Qingyu’s eyes were closed and didn’t dare to look at Ye Qingtian.

While Lin Yun examined Bai Qingyu, he had to admit that she was beautiful. Her temperament was entirely different from Bai Shuying's. She wasn’t aloof and elegant like Bai Shuying, but there was a hint of liveliness. She was also a beauty, but their temperaments were entirely different.

Recollecting his thoughts, Lin Yun circulated the Blue Dragon Bone. As blue radiance shone out from him, it instantly enveloped Bai Qingyu. In just one night, Bai Qingyu had recovered a small portion of her dragon pulses, and she could barely circulate her nirvana aura to treat her injuries. Lin Yun left the bath and a white mist came out from his body as the water evaporated.

Three days later, Bai Qingyu had completely refined the Snow Lotus Heart. Not only did she recover from her injuries, but she even took a step further.

“Bai Qingyu, it’s time for you to leave,” Lin Yun said.

“I have to leave?” Bai Qingyu felt terrible, and she held onto the Stalewater Sword tightly. “Senior Brother, I won’t hold you down.”

But she immediately regretted it the moment she said that. She initially wanted revenge for her elder sister and followed Ye Qingtian into the Myriad Graves Valley. But after they interacted, she realized that she misunderstood him. After that, she did nothing but cause trouble for Ye Qingtian and nearly became a cripple.

Now that she had recovered, it was time for her to leave. But for some reason, she couldn’t help feeling a little disappointed. She thought that their relationship had improved after experiencing so much together. Bai Qingyu said, “Ye Qingtian, let me follow and help you.”

But Lin Yun shook his head and replied, “Even I might die during what I’ll do next. Are you sure you can help me?”

Bai Qingyu was disappointed when she heard that, and she said, “Senior Brother, I understand.”

Lin Yun nodded, “I’ll get Lil’ Red to send you back. There shouldn’t be any dangers along the way.”

Bai Qingyu didn’t refuse that offer and asked, “Senior Brother, are they really dead?”RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“All dead,” Lin Yun said.

“The Indigocloth Venerable is also dead?” Bai Qingyu asked.

“Her as well. Why are you asking about her?” Lin Yun asked curiously.

“I can’t believe you’d kill such a beauty like her,” Bai Qingyu muttered.

“Even if she’s beautiful, I won’t hold back since she threatened me. Not to mention she’s not as beautiful as you or your sister,” Lin Yun said indifferently.

“Really? If I was not Bai Shuying’s younger sister, would you save me?” Bai Qingyu asked happily.

But Lin Yun maintained his silence and said nothing.

Bai Qingyu’s smile disappeared, and she lowered her head, “All right. I understand.”

“Let her follow you. Since we’re going to look for the Udumbara Flower, she might be able to help us,” Lil’ Purple said.

Bai Qingyu widened her pupils and firmly said, “Ye Qingtian, believe me that I can help you.”

Lin Yun pondered for a long time before he ultimately nodded. It was mainly because the Myriad Graves Valley was too dangerous, and not even Lil’ Red could protect her if they ran into danger.

“Hehe, you’re not allowed to take your words back, then,” Bai Qingyu said excitedly.

It didn’t take long for them to reach the depths of the Myriad Graves Valley. This entire region was enveloped in a crimson mist, and there were a lot of tombs.

Lin Yun circulated the Azure Dragon Sword Heart and sensed the dangers here. His Azure Dragon Sword Heart had reached a high stage, and he could sense the dangers. So it was convenient to avoid unnecessary trouble.

“How is it?” Lil’ Purple asked.

“It’s weird. The depths of the Myriad Graves Valley is dangerous, and yet I can sense so much hostility with my sword heart,” Lin Yun said.

“Sword intent is the bane of all evil. The Blood Crows are manifestations of sin, so they probably detected your presence,” Lil’ Purple said.

“Let me take a look at the situation first.” Lin Yun flew to the sky and circulated the Divine Dragon Eyes, piercing through the crimson mist, capturing everything within a few thousand miles. “There are a lot of Blood Crows in the depths of the Myriad Graves Valley, and there are thousands of Blood Crows within three thousand miles. Many of them are comparable to the top thirty of the King Ranking.”

What he saw was only the tip of the iceberg, and ordinary cultivators wouldn’t even know how they died if they stepped in there. Even if Xiao Jingyan and the Indigocloth Venerable joined hands together, they definitely wouldn’t dare to intrude on the crimson mist.
