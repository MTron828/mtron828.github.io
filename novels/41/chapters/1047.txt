Chapter 1048 - Invincible

A massacre of all the geniuses who joined the Realm Sons was completely unexpected. The aftermath looked like hell on earth as Lin Yun walked past the mountain of corpses.

At this moment, Lin Yun walked through a silent street. He could hear the commotion on the city wall and the terrifying aura coming from the Realm Sons. He could sense that they were waiting for him to crawl in. He could also sense many experts that were with the Realm Sons that were forming a blockade.

Lin Yun merely glanced at them indifferently.

“I don’t want to implicate others in my conflict with the Realm Sons. If you don’t want to die, you better leave. Otherwise, I can’t be blamed for killing any of you!” Lin Yun spoke blatantly to the crowd while he infused his sword with sky sword intent.

At this moment, no one dared to meet Lin Yun’s domineering eyes. Their hearts throbbed violently at Lin Yun’s arrogance.

“Wow, looking down on us. Haha…” An eccentric voice sounded out from the crowd. A white-clothed youth was hiding in the crowd. He might be cautious, but he couldn’t stand Lin Yun’s attitude.

Lin Yun didn’t react after hearing the youth. Instead, he unleashed his sky sword intent to the fullest. WIth every step he took, clouds tumbled through the sky while the humming of a sword echoed out. At this moment, all of the generals wore an ugly expression.

They were tasked to guard this place after receiving benefits from the Realm Sons, so they were making a stand. Naturally, they thought that the Realm Sons would easily kill Lin Yun and that they wouldn’t have to work too hard. However, they became anxious after coming face to face with Lin Yun. After all, he already slaughtered everyone that stood in his way.

Up to this point, Lin Yun had never lost a fight in the Heavenly Path. Additionally, he killed all the generals in the Yellow Sandy Plain. So when Lin Yun decided to step forward, the crowd couldn’t help but tremble in fear

“How mighty. You still dare to act with such arrogance even when facing death? Lin Yun, this is Wind Mound City, the territory of the Realm Sons. It’s not a place for you to act wantonly. If you get down on your knees, the Realm Sons might spare your life,” said the white-clothed youth in an eerie voice with reluctance in his eyes. At the same time, he continued to move within the crowd to change his position.

Because of his words, those who were hesitating began to look at Lin Yun with greed. After all, the promise given by the Realm Sons was too great to ignore.

“Who’s speaking?!” Lin Yun said coldly.

“Who do you think you are to question us? Do you really think that you’re invincible all by yourself?” The white-clothed youth’s voice continued to echo out.

“Why would I come if I didn’t have an invincible heart?” Lin Yun suddenly looked in a direction and tapped his finger out. A brilliant sword ray shot out of his finger and pierced the forehead of the white-clothed youth. Just like that, the youth lost his life as his corpse hit the ground.

As the leader of a higher realm, the youth couldn’t accept someone from a lower realm receiving such fame. So he tried to instigate the crowd to kill Lin Yun. However, he was silenced in the blink of an eye.

Lin Yun’s move had completely revealed his dominance. Since he was at the last checkpoint before reaching the Realm Sons, he wanted to intimidate the entire crowd.

“Get lost!” Lin Yun said coldly. His patience had run out and his killing aura was getting stronger. Aside from the generals, the other geniuses had a little fear on their faces.

Lin Yun merely looked at them in pity because they were being used as tools of the Realm Sons. Everyone in the crowd was at least in the purple ranking and they weren’t willing to retreat. Then again, they didn’t deserve Lin Yun’s pity because they dared to stand in his way.

“Flower Burial, you truly deserve your reputation.” A golden beam shot down from the sky and a youth carrying a sword appeared.

“Yang Shuo of the Gold Ranking!”

Everyone had joy on their faces because Yang Shuo was ranked 18th on the gold ranking. Although he wasn’t as strong as the Realm Sons, he wasn't much weaker. Suddenly, another golden beam descended from the sky. This time, a white-clothed youth carrying a halberd on his back appeared.

“Ouyang Yu of the gold ranking!” At this moment, many people were descending from the sky.

“Nie Feng of the gold ranking!”

“Zhao Shiqi of the gold ranking!”

“Xu Zilin of the gold ranking!” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Liu Feiyu of the gold ranking!” Six geniuses from the gold ranking had appeared!

Each of them had great fortune in the Heavenly Path and had been waiting for a chance to fight Lin Yun. They were also the source of the tension in Four Phase City.

In their eyes, Lin Yun peaked too early in the Heavenly Path. After all, many geniuses made it into the gold ranking and overshadowed Lin Yun’s radiance. But for some reason, Lin Yun was more popular despite having a lower rank. It was annoying to say the least, so it wasn’t surprising that many people were unhappy with Lin Yun.

“Kneel. There are orders from the Realm Sons that you need to crawl into the plaza,” said one of the higher ranking geniuses.

“The fact that you dare to come alone proves your courage. No one will dare to mock you since you’ve come this far. It isn’t considered shameful if you kneel to the Realm Sons. After all, you’ve offended an existence that you shouldn’t have offended,” said Ouyang Yu.

“Lin Yun, don’t force us to make a move. It will only end badly for you,” said Zhao Shiqi.

As for the crowd, they felt joy at the arrival of the newcomers. Excitement filled their eyes because Lin Yun was doomed.

Lin Yun merely glanced at the newcomers before laughing, “Like I said, anyone who dares to stand in my way will die. This goes for everyone regardless of ranking!”

Then, Lin Yun raised his hand as a sword ray shone like a bright sun. He would slaughter the entire gold ranking today!
