Chapter 2098 - Hot-Headed (1)

After Lin Yun and Wang Muyan set a month's deadline, they met the Heavenly Yi Saint Lord with the Divine Solar Lunar Art.

“The Divine Solar Lunar Art? You two want to exchange this cultivation technique?” The Heavenly Yi Saint Lord asked in a surprised tone.

“That’s right.” Lin Yun nodded.

The Heavenly Yi Saint Lord said, “This cultivation technique is heavily incomplete, and it’s impossible to reach the end of it. The process might be dangerous because the mantra isn’t complete, and you must complete it yourself.”

“So it will be dangerous if we insist on cultivating?” Lin Yun asked.

“That’s right. You two will have to gauge how dangerous it is yourself. The hardest part is trying to perfect it because you can only rely on your comprehension. If either of you manage to cultivate it successfully, I could give you two a Phoenix Blood Sword Soul each,” the Heavenly Yi Saint Lord said. The Phoenix Blood Sword Soul was a treasure. Not only could it increase one’s attainment in sword dao, the value was even greater than the Great Solar Saint Pellets and Great Lunar Saint Pellets.

When hearing it, Lin Yun’s eyes lit up because the reward was tempting. At the same time, he finally knew why the cultivation techniques here didn’t require any contribution points, and that you would even be rewarded for practicing them.

The Heavenly Dao Sect used them to perfect the cultivation techniques. If the cultivation techniques could be perfected, they could be placed in the Contribution Hall for saint disciples to practice. After all, perfecting cultivation techniques had nothing to do with cultivation but comprehension and talent. Even an ordinary saint’s comprehension and talent might not be comparable to a golden-generation genius at the Quasi-Saint Realm.

“The Divine Solar Lunar Art is comprehensive, and the first step is to comprehend the Dragon Sun and Moon Seal. This seal consists of nine variations, so you two can try to comprehend it first. I have some notes left behind by the predecessors who have tried to practice it, so you two can refer to them.” The Heavenly Yi Saint Lord was honest and gave them the notes and a painting. He continued, “You two can cultivate on the first level during this period.”

Lin Yun and Wang Muyan left after stowing the notes and painting.

“Ye Qingtian, we can complete the Dragon Sun and Moon Seal without talent, but comprehending the variations is difficult. We’ll bet on who can develop more variations within one month.” Wang Muyan smiled with her eyes shining brightly.

“Sure.” Lin Yun nodded.

“The Heavenly Yi Saint Lord missed out on something. As long as you master the Dragon Sun and Moon Seal, you’ll have a better grasp of your dual sword stars, and you can infuse your comprehension into your sword dao. So the variations are practically tailor-made for you,” Wang Muyan smiled.

“Why are you telling me that?” Lin Yun asked.

“Ye Qingtian, I’m not sweet-talking; I have you in my heart. Let’s meet again a month from now,” Wang Muyan smiled mysteriously and left.

“Hmph, that vixen!” Lil’ Purple snorted in the Iris Secret Realm.

Holding onto the painting, Lin Yun whispered, “Why do I feel that she haslong prepared the Divine Solar Lunar Art for me? Otherwise, isn’t this too much of a coincidence?”

It was too much of a coincidence for Wang Muyan to find that book just when he needed a way to cultivate his dual sword stars. Was she trying to win him over?

“Lin Yun, don’t tell me that she is bewitching you. She’s terrifying!” Lil’ Purple exclaimed. “She’s clearly trying to bluff you into accepting the bet to undo the Nether Shackles for her.”

“I know,” Lin Yun said.

“Then, why did you still agree to the bet if you knew?” Lil’ Purple asked curiously.

“She can guess my identity and know what I’m searching for, but she definitely doesn’t know that I’ve obtained the Divine Solar Lunar Fist back on the Heavenly Path,” Lin Yun said. “That’s the complete Divine Solar Lunar Fist, and I have grasped at least three variations of the Dragon Sun and Moon Seal.”Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Oh, yeah.” Lil’ Purple’s eyes lit up upon hearing that.

“She’s smart but made a mistake this time,” Lin Yun said. It was more or less the same as what Lin Yun had guessed.

Wang Muyan had long started practicing the Divine Solar Lunar Art. Not only did she grasp the Dragon Sun and Moon, she had even grasped two variations. The Nether Shackles were a great restriction to her, and it would be dangerous for her to make a breakthrough to the Quasi-Saint Realm if she couldn’t undo it.

She was confident that Ye Qingtian would pay the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda a visit with the appearance of the Blue Dragon Record. He would either enter the Temporal Realm or search for a method to cultivate his dual sword stars, so she already had a corresponding countermeasure for both.

It wasn’t a coincidence but a plan that she had devised for Lin Yun. Lin Yun would lose if he chose the Divine Solar Lunar Art because Wang Muyan had already practiced it, and she knew how difficult it was. She refused to believe that Lin Yun could surpass her within one month.

Once the bet began, Lin Yun entered a cultivating chamber on the first level and took out the notes left behind by predecessors. Many people contributed to the notes, but there wasn’t much useful information. There were even some parts that contradicted each other.

While Lin Yun practiced the Divine Solar Lunar Art according to how he practiced the Divine Solar Lunar Fist, he easily picked out the correct information within the notes. After he went through the notes, he unscrolled the painting, which was crucial to the Divine Solar Lunar Art.

There was a cauldron painted on the canvas when he unfolded the painting and had it hovering in the air. This was the Dragon Sun and Moon Cauldron with many ancient runes. If one stared at the cauldron, one would notice that it was slowly revolving, as though it had come to life within the painting.

Lin Yun wasn’t in a hurry to cultivate, but threw the notes away because he had to forget them. While Lin Yun sat with his legs crossed, he began to simulate the Dragon Sun and Moon Cauldron within his mind. Soon, half a month had passed.

“Ye Qingtian still isn’t out yet?” Wang Muyan found the Heavenly Yi Saint Lord and stood outside Lin Yun's chamber.

The Heavenly Yi Saint Lord was polite to Wang Muyan as he said, “Yeah. Not only that, but he has even ripped the notes apart.”

“What is he trying to do?” Wang Muyan asked in surprise.

“He must have his understanding, wanting to forget everything written on the notes. But that’s too difficult because he’ll run amok if he walks on the wrong path,” the Heavenly Yi Saint Lord said with concern.

“He’s too bold, and young people shouldn’t get too hot-headed,” Wang Muyan smiled.

“How can youths not be hot-headed?” The chamber opened as Lin Yun walked out. He naturally heard the conversation between Wang Muyan and the Heavenly Yi Saint Lord.

Wang Muyan raised her head to look at Lin Yun, full of energy. His eyes were shining brightly, as though he really had his understanding.

“It looks like the holy maiden is rather concerned about me. I’m honored.” Lin Yun smiled as he came out of the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda.

Wang Muyan was stunned before she frowned. She muttered to herself, “What is he planning? His sword dao seems to have gotten stronger than before. Don’t tell me that he really succeeded?”
