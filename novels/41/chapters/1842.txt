Chapter 1843 - Retrieving Wine

In the Demigod Wine Cellar, Lin Yun’s group of four was excited because everything in this cellar belonged to them without any interference from outsiders. That was especially the case after Gu Jun verified the existence of the demigod wine. The three’s faces changed, and they were a lot more excited than before.

If there wasn’t any demigod wine, the value of this wine cellar would greatly decrease. As for Lin Yun, he had drunk a lot of high-quality wine, and the effects of drinking them again would greatly decline. Then again, it was worthwhile to be drunk for good wine. That was especially the case for the Mo Clan’s Millennium Flame, and the taste made Lin Yun reminisce for a long time.

If demigod wine really existed, Lin Yun would definitely undergo a great boost in his strength. At the very least, he was confident that he could reach the limit of the Dragon Pulse Realm.

“Where’s the demigod wine?” Lin Yun asked.

Gu Jun stared at the crystal statue for a long time before he said, “The demigod wine will need that crystal statue to play a melody before the array can be activated. That’s the only way to obtain the demigod wine.”

“It looks like my speculation is right.” Mei Zihua’s eyes lit up.

“Ha. I advise you not to mess around. You don’t have the corresponding score, and you will die if you’re not careful.” Gu Jun sneered.

Hearing that, Mei Zihua awkwardly smiled. He was a little afraid of this old man.

“How can we retrieve the wine, then?” Lin Yun looked at a wine cabinet in a corner.There was a lot of great wine he had never drunk before.

“There’s a restriction on the wine cabinet, and not even a quasi-saint can do anything to those restrictions. Back then, this wine cellar was managed by a butler, and no one could come in to obtain any wine.” Gu Jun explained.

The moment he said that Lin Yun, An Liuyan, and Mei Zihua became silent. Not even quasi-saints could destroy the restriction. Did that mean that they could only look at them?

“Let me give it a try.” Mei Zihua refused to believe it and walked towards a wine cabinet. But surprisingly, Lin Yun and Gu Jun didn’t stop him. After taking three steps out, Mei Zihua was placed in a difficult position because he was initially putting on an act and wanted someone to stop him. Mei Zihua was a fool, and he was casually talking about it because he knew how bizarre this place was.

According to previous experience, Lin Yun and Gu Jun would definitely stop him, and he could retreat according to their words. But neither Lin Yun nor Gu jun spoke, especially Gu Jun, who looked at him playfully.

In the end, Mei Zihua gritted his teeth and continued forth. But he didn’t dare to get close to the wine cabinet. Just ten feet away from the pool, his body suddenly started swaying like he was drunk.

Lin Yun squinted his eyes and carefully examined Mei Zihua. There was an invisible fog covering the water fountain. It was a golden alcohol aroma shrouding all the wine cabinets. It couldn’t be seen with the naked eye, but it did exist.

Anyone who stepped forth would fall for it, and even someone like Mei Zihua with a strong mentality could barely last for ten breaths.

“Is Young Master Mei alright?” An Liuyan asked.

“He won’t die. He’ll only be asleep for ten days to half a month. That fellow was getting in the way, so it’s good to let him lie down for a while.” Gu Jun said indolently.

Lin Yun dashed forth. But when he was getting close to the wine cabinet containing Millennium Flame, his face changed and quickly retreated. He had some conscience, so he picked up Mei Zihua as he retreated. This way, Mei Zihua would recover a lot faster.

“Even I can’t last for long.” Lin Yun said.

The alcohol aroma was everywhere, but it was no threat to him. It would only make him drunk. Even his sword intent couldn’t isolate the alcohol aroma, and his powerful physique could only allow him to last for a longer time.

“There’s no solution.” Lin Yun held onto his chin.

“Are you stupid? So what if you can last long? I already said there are restrictions on those cabinets that even a quasi-saint is helpless before it.” Gu Jun smiled.

“Elder Gu, you must have a way, right?” An Liuyan smiled.

“Of course. But I’ll give you guys a disclaimer. I want 90% of the wines here, and you guys can divide the remaining 10% amongst yourselves. As for demigod wine, I’ll give you a few droplets. You’ll die if you drink too much at your current cultivation.” Gu Jun held onto his chin and stated his terms.

“How long does it take for you to recover your heart’s blood?” Lin Yun asked.

“About half a year? Why? You’re suddenly worried about me?” Gu Jun smiled.

“You shouldn’t be able to exert more than the Profound Death Stage cultivation, right?” Lin Yun smiled.

Gu Jun’s face suddenly changed, and he angrily said, “You bastard! You’re threatening me?!”

“30%.” Lin Yun said. But before Gu Jun could reply, he continued, “70% for me and 30% for you.”

“I give up. You can just kill me.” Gu Jun said furiously.

Right then, An Liuyan quickly stepped forth, and she comforted, “Elder Gu, what are you talking about? The young master still has to rely on you with the restrictions. Didn't the young master take care of you along the way here? When that woman wanted your heart’s blood, the young master even stood before you.”

“Definitely not 70!” Gu Jun muttered.

“And you’re asking for 90% just earlier.” An Liuyan chuckled.

“I’m just talking about it.” Gu Jun’s face flushed.

Lin Yun didn’t want to waste time with Gu Jun, and he said, “You can take 40%. After all, you brought us here. If we can obtain the demigod wine, you can have 70% of the remaining wine, and I’ll only take 30%.”

He had a feeling that demigod wine wasn’t that simple. But it would be another story if they could obtain it.

“That’s more like it. But why do you need the demigod wine?” Gu Jun asked cautiously.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Lin Yun didn’t answer him, but looked around, “Actually, I have roughly found out how to break the restrictions.”

“What?” Gu Jun was alarmed. “I don’t believe you.”

“Why do you think I tried to dash over, then? The key probably lies in that crystal statue. Since the restrictions and the array are one, that crystal woman should be the heart of the array.” Lin Yun smiled.

“How do you know that?!” Gu Jun exclaimed, and he soon realized he had a slip of the tongue.

Lin Yun smiled when he heard that because he had guessed it. He knew that he would be tricked by this old man if he wasn’t shrewd. He said, “Let’s talk about it again after we obtain the demigod wine. If we don’t manage to get it, the other top-tiered wines will be enough for you to drink for a long time. You know that I have already taken a huge step back, and I can let you have half of the other wines. Besides, you’re of no help here. Without me, you also won’t be able to come here, right?”

Those words made Gu Jun fall silent for a long time.

“Alright. We’re all into this together, and there’s no need for us to be so calculative. Don’t you know how I am as a person? You just need to keep your tricks to yourself. Boss An didn’t treat you badly in the Heavenly Star Pavilion, right? I remember you still owe her a lot of money.” Lin Yun said with his brow raised, and this made An Liuyan smile upon hearing that.

At this moment, Gu Jun really wanted to give himself a slap. He regretted taking so much from the Heavenly Star Pavilion, since he could only be manipulated by this couple now.

“Alright.” Gu Jun gritted his teeth. “I’ll break the restriction, so you find a way to retrieve the wine.”

Gu Jun then took out an erhu and started playing it. He played ancient sacrificial music that sounded like rumbling thunder.

This made Lin Yun surprised because Gu Jun was pretty good at it, and he almost forgot Gu Jun was a Grand Musician who’d grasped the Great Saint Tune, and he might even come in contact with the surface of the Saint King Tune.

Even Mei Zihua was pale in comparison to him. Very quickly, the crystal statue began to move, and she also blew out a melody as well.

The saint runes around the pool began to bloom, and the restrictions on the wine cabinets were swiftly being broken. The closed cabinet doors began to open.

With a single thought, the Black Thunder Chain flew out from Lin Yun’s right hand and the nine chains flew out like agile serpents. Very quickly, the chains came to the cabinet where the Millennium Flame was stored.

The chains coiled around a wine jar and flew back. When Lin Yun held onto the jar, he could feel the heavy weight, signifying that this really was a spatial treasure. Lin Yun was also worried something might happen, but he didn’t have such concerns anymore.
