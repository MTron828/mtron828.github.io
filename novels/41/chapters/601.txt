Chapter 602 - Unrivalled Overlord Sword

The bark echoed in everyone’s ears as Lin Yun threw his punch out. The dracophant energy surged within his body and he merged his sword energy with thirty cauldron’s worth of strength. His power gushed out like a ferocious beast.

Neither Leng Haoyu’s sword nor Lin Zhiyuan’s fist were comparable to Lin Yun’s punch. They were both sent flying away. The saintly music and sword buzz from Lin Yun’s punch had shocked everyone. They all looked at Lin Yun with shock in their eyes as they began to wonder who Lin Yun was.

When Lin Yun saw Leng Haoyu and Lin Zhiyuan ganging up on Mo Ling, his rage flared up in a split second. The two were simply too shameless to gang up on Mo Ling. Therefore, he charged over with the Seven Profound Steps to stand before Mo Ling.

“Lin Yun?” Leng Haoyu and Lin Zhiyuan were both shocked. They thought it was Zhang Yuan that came, but they were surprised to see Lin Yun here. They might be ranked towards the rear of the Dragoncloud Ranking, they were still existences that those outside the ranking could only look up to. Only a core disciple of an overlord force like Zhang Yuan could enter their eyes.

Lin Yun was just a swordsman who came from the Great Qin Empire. Even if he had defeated Cao Zhen, he still couldn’t enter their eyes. After their initial shock, Leng Haoyu’s eyes began to turn eerie with a smirk on his lips. Since Lin Yun was here, then he might as well take Lin Yun’s life. Lin Yun was placed on the bounty list on the Bloodwing Pavilion, to begin with. So if he could kill Lin Yun, he would become famous in the sect.

“Leave this place first. Leng Haoyu won’t go easy on you…” Mo Ling said quickly as she rushed over to Lin Yun. She knew what sort of vicious person Leng Haoyu was and she knew that he wouldn’t let this opportunity go.

“Since you’re here, then don’t bother leaving,” grinned Leng Haoyu as he looked at Lin Yun. “You’re a really terrifying person. I heard that you weren’t even in the Violet Palace Realm three months ago. I bet you got a decent harvest in the Withernorth Sea, right? But what a pity that you ran into me!”

He then gave Lin Zhiyuan a glance and commanded, “Let’s go!”

He was still as cunning as before. First, he attracted Lin Yun’s attention with his words before instructing Lin Zhiyuan to attack all of a sudden. If someone else was in Lin Yun’s position, they would definitely be caught by surprise.

Lin Zhiyuan sneered and threw out his punch. Emitting a purple glow on his body, Lin Zhiyuan threw out his punch, “Die!”

The earth began to tremble violently from the punch, which terrified everyone greatly. Under Lin Zhiyuan’s punch, even the air seemed to have shattered.

“Watch out!” Mo Ling exclaimed.

“Let me play with you then,” said Lin Yun as sword intent glowed within his eyes. As a ripple spread out, the Iris Sword Sutra began to boil and filled Lin Yun’s violet palace with origin energy. Now that he had reached the Yang stage using the Profound Yin Water, it had completely transformed his body. In terms of origin energy, he wasn’t any weaker than Lin Zhiyuan.

Facing the punch coming at him while his clothes fluttered, Lin Yun soared into the sky and threw a punch. However, his punch not only contained thirty cauldron’s of strength, but also a strand of his silver sword intent.

When the two fists clashed, it was like two ferocious beasts clashing together. This made Lin Zhiyuan shocked because he wasn’t able to get the upper hand in his clash with Lin Yun.

“Xiantian sword intent on greater mastery?” Leng Haoyu frowned his eyebrows when he saw this scene. There might only be a strand of sword intent in Lin Yun’s punch, but he could sense it clearly, which was the reason for his shock.

After all, there were no more than ten people in the Ancient Southern Domain who possessed a xiantian sword intent at greater mastery. He couldn’t imagine how an eighteen-year-old young man managed to come this far. Even his xiantian sword intent had some distance to go before reaching lesser mastery.

Lin Yun and Lin Zhiyuan clashed over a dozen times and Lin Yun’s punches weren’t any inferior to Lin Zhiyuan. When Lin Yun realized that, disdain was written on his face. He now knew why Lin Zhiyuan was ranked towards the rear on the ranking, “You’re not so impressive after all…”

Not to mention Yang Fan, but Lin Zhiyuan couldn’t even be compared to Guo Xu.

“You!” Lin Zhiyuan’s face became ugly when he saw the disdain in Lin Yun’s eyes. He began to circulate the origin energy within his body and he threw two punches towards Lin Yun.

But when his punches landed on Lin Yun, he was shocked to discover a purple-gold armor on Lin Yun’s body with an ancient dracophant glowing on it. After the Dracophant Battle Physique reached the seventh stage, the Dracophant War Armor looked more like a genuine ancient dracophant.

When the two punches landed on Lin Yun’s armor, the power was instantly dissipated. Lin Zhiyuan wasn’t even able to harm Lin Yun. But just when Lin Zhiyuan was shocked, Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly as a terrifying killing aura burst out of his body that sent Lin Zhiyuan flying.

Seven Slaughtering Fist—Raging Sky!

When Lin Yun took a step forward, he closed the distance between him and Lin Zhiyuan. Lin Yun’s surging sword intent made the sky turn dark and it felt like he had the killing aura of an army. When the army roared along with Lin Yun’s fist, Lin Zhiyuan was sent flying a few hundred meters away while vomiting blood.

“Die!” Another roar sounded out. Lin Zhiyuan was greatly terrified as he ran for his life crawling. But just when Lin Yun was about to throw another punch out, a sinister aura suddenly shot over that made Lin Yun retreat instantly.

But he was still one step too slow as a huge gash appeared on his side. The attack naturally came from Leng Haoyu. Leng Haoyu had calculated that Lin Yun wouldn’t be able to dodge his attack. He was shrouded in a crimson fog. The fog was his bloodlust sword energy, which was venomous like a viper.

“Die!” Leng Haoyu was a decisive person and he had no intention of letting Lin Yun off. He quickly followed up with the intention of taking Lin Yun’s life.

Without a sword in his hand, Lin Yun could only retreat when facing Leng Haoyu’s attacks.

“And here I thought you were formidable . You’re just a piece of trash. You call yourself Flower Burial with this much ability? What a joke!” Leng Haoyu wore a smug look as he forced Lin Yun to retreat under his attacks. So what if Lin Yun’s xiantian sword intent was in greater mastery? He still had to die!

Bloodlust Incineration!

Leng Haoyu’s sword aura boiled like a crimson flame as he swung his sword out. The torrential crimson flames were like a demon from hell that devoured Lin Yun in the blink of an eye. His attack was too quick and Lin Yun was devoured by the crimson flames before the spectators could realize it.

But before anyone could react, a roar was heard as a boundless sword intent pierced through the crimson flames. Before a swordsman in the surrounding area could react, he lost control of his sword. His sword turned into a beam of light that flew into the crimson flames. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Overlord Sword—Thunderbolt Slasher!

The torrential sword aura soared into the sky like a bolt of lightning that tore the crimson flames apart. The crimson flames had crumbled apart before it could even truly trap Lin Yun.
