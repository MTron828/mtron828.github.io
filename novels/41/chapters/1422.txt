Chapter 1423 - My Heart Stolen By A Scumbag

Waves began to roar within Lin Yun’s sword ocean when he held onto the tenth-grade Spiritual Sword Bead and the golden human involuntarily opened its eyes. This instantly made Lin Yun realize that the tenth-grade Spiritual Sword Bead was a treasure, since his firmament sword intent had been stuck in the lesser mastery for a long time.

After all, it was challenging to improve the sword intent, even if it was just slightly. Not to mention that he possessed two sword souls, and this only made improving his sword intent even harder.

Lin Yun had taken it slowly for so long. But the tenth-grade Spiritual Sword Bead drew a reaction from his sword ocean when he held onto it, and this was the first time the golden human sword soul showed a thirst for something.

“Lin Yun, you bastard! You dare to snatch the Spiritual Sword Bead that belongs to me?!” Xiahou Yan cursed with his eyes bulging out when he saw this scene. He had grasped the firmament sword intent for nearly a year and was stuck in lesser mastery. Even the pinnacle of lesser mastery was far away.

As the prince of a Saint Clan, he had access to much information. Any treasure that could improve the sword intent was costly. Those treasures weren’t just rare, they were supreme treasures. This was why he was determined to obtain the tenth-grade Spiritual Sword Bead after hearing about it. Thus, he flew into a rage when Lin Yun got it.

Lin Yun’s expression became weird when he heard that. He didn’t know where Xiahou Yan got the cheek to claim that the tenth-grade Spiritual Sword Bead belonged to him. But since there was no need to play with Xiahou Yan any longer, Lin Yun soared to the sky. “Lil’ Red, come back.”

Receiving his orders, Lil’ Red, fighting with the six, backed off before soaring to the sky.

“You bastard! You want to leave?!” Raging flames blazed through Xiahou Yan’s eyes as his pupils became gold. His body released a jadeite glow with his heart pumping like a cauldron with immense power coursing through his body. This instantly increased his sword aura by several levels.

Chen Bing, who was just beside Xiahou Yan, was surprised before his expression became grave. Everyone knew that Xiahou Yan was talented since he possessed the Innate Sword Physique and Innate Sword Heart, but not many people had the opportunity to see him release both at once. Even Huang Yancheng had only seen it once, and he still felt shocked after seeing it again.

When Xiahou Yan thrust his sword, a sword ray three hundred meters long flew out and pierced through space. Seeing that this sword was about to land on Lil’ Red, the Ancient Dracoape suddenly disappeared.

When everyone recovered from the shock, they stared straight at Lil’ Red, who had turned into a little cat. It was a plump black cat, and no one could imagine that it was the Ancient Dracoape from before. Since Lil’ Red returned to its cat form, this also meant that Xiahou Yan’s attack missed.

Then, Lil’ Red disappeared in the Barren Sword Mound within a few leaps. The surroundings were a sword mound, so it was dark and lifeless, not to mention that the previous battle had utterly ruined the terrain. So it was practically impossible to try and find it.

Did it just run? The four brothers of the Huang Clan and Chen Bing were stumped. The dracoape that played around with them and made them into such an embarrassing state ran away? This nearly made them throw out blood, and they couldn’t express what they were feeling now, especially Huang Yancheng, whose face turned black. He received the most beatings from the Ancient Dracoape. Even after he summoned his constellation, the Ancient Dracoape would use various means to weaken his attacks.

“Xiahou Yan, why didn’t you make a move earlier?” Huang Yancheng couldn’t help roaring at Xiahou Yan after suffering so much. Although Chen Bing didn’t say a word, his face was also ugly as he looked at Xiahou Yan.

But Xiahou Yan didn’t bat an eye at them and roared, “Get lost! If you two have to depend on me all the time, what use do the two of you have? You guys said that I didn’t use my full strength? Does that mean you guys used your full strength earlier?”

His words stumped the two, and Huang Yancheng didn’t dare to say another word, but his face changed.

Xiahou Yan gritted his teeth while he clenched his right fist. He had to bring out his full strength when facing a pet? What would it make others think of him? Most importantly, he didn’t think Lin Yun could deal with the Indigo Dragon Serpent so quickly.

He was cautious, and he had been paying attention to Lin Yun. The beginning was more or less what he had expected. Even if Lin Yun was strong, the Indigo Dragon Serpent was still struggling violently and hadn’t reached the point of death at all.

But when he turned his attention away for a split second, Lin Yun had already obtained the tenth-grade Spiritual Sword Bead. Huang Yancheng and Chen Bing might be unhappy, but he was the most upset person here.

“Shit, he’s leaving!” Chen Bing suddenly spoke up.

While they were arguing amongst themselves, Lin Yun easily collected a hundred ordinary Spiritual Sword Beads without much effort. Ordinary Spiritual Sword Beads weren’t easy to collect because of the intense competition there, but it was nothing for Lin Yun because no one dared to compete with him.

Moreover, Lin Yun already had some accumulation, so it didn’t take long for him to gather all hundred of them. When he was done, Lin Yun didn’t hesitate to immediately leave the Barren Sword Mound and teleported out of the secret realm.

“It ended? Just like that?” Xiahou Yan’s face looked stiff, and he couldn’t accept this fact. He hadn’t brought out his full strength, and Lin Yun wasn’t going to stay around to play with him?

“Look, Flower Burial has come out!” When Lin Yun appeared on the stage outside, his appearance immediately sparked an uproar. Lin Yun was now a famous figure even if he didn’t clash with Xiahou Yan’s party head-on. The scenes of him fighting the Indigo Dragon Serpent were still fresh in their minds.

Ye Ziling and Zhao Yan also appeared on the stage shortly after him. They had collected enough Spiritual Sword Beads long ago, but they were worried about Lin Yun, so they didn’t choose to come out.

"I'm fine, don't look at me like that." Lin Yun smiled and gave the two a wink.

“Junior Brother Lin!”

“Senior Sister!” Feng Zhang, Liu Qingyan, and Gongsun Yan gathered over.

“Lin Yun, you bastard! Lil’ Red isn’t out yet!” Lil’ Purple’s voice resounded from the sword box. “You bastard! Lil’ Red took so many beatings for you, and yet you ran away without bringing him along! You scumbag!” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Lin Yun gave himself a facepalm when he heard that. He had genuinely forgotten about Lil’ Red. This made him wonder where that shameless cat had gone. Once the test ends, everyone who didn’t belong in the secret realm would be forcibly brought out, so Lil’ Red would probably be sent out as well.

“Lin Yun, is that your cat…?” Gongsun Yan mustered his courage and pointed at a screen.

When Lin Yun turned his head over, he realized that everything that happened in the secret realm could be seen outside. Then again, this was something he had already expected because saints would pick their disciples, and they naturally had to see the performance of their potential disciples before making a choice.

Now, what was Gongsun Yan saying earlier? When Lin Yun looked at the screen Gongsun Yan pointed at, he saw Lil’ Red, and his expression instantly became weird. Lil’ Red had sneakily appeared beside an ancient sword and began to chuckle.

“Haha, that cat is so interesting. It’s pretty cute too. Look at it!”

“That cat is amusing. Is it trying to draw that sword? It’s trying to leave with the sword in the sword mound!”

“Haha, that cat is really shameless. That’s the sword mound, and all the swords there are spiritual.” When swords were buried in the sword mound, it meant that their fate has ended, and some would even contain fragments of their owners’ souls. So it was naturally impossible for Lil’ Red to leave with them.

When Lil’ Red failed, it wasn’t disappointed. It then began to stroll around the secret realm. Occasionally, it would pick up something from the ground, which instantly made everyone’s gazes become weird as they looked at Lin Yun.

“Your cat is really unique…” Gongsun Yan awkwardly smiled, but he became even more awkward when he realized that no one was paying attention to him.

The current Lil’ Red was despicable and shameless, a great contrast to the Ancient Dracoape. But Lin Yun gradually smiled when he saw what Lil’ Red was doing. It was picking up the dragon scales of the Indigo Dragon Serpent.

Those were treasures that not even the firmament sword intent could break through, especially two of the scales, which were even tougher than the rest. They were the scales meant to protect the head and beast core. He practically forgot about those, but Lil’ Red had collected them for him. Lin Yun couldn’t help smiling at the thought of this.

Since there were four hours until the test ended, Lin Yun wasn’t in a hurry. He sat down and started cultivating. He could make a breakthrough to the Greater Elysium Core Realm if he wanted, especially after using the Sovereign Divine Rune in his battle with the Indigo Dragon Serpent. So he might as well make use of the time and cultivate now.

Four hours later, everyone was teleported out of the secret realm. When Xiahou Yan’s party appeared, they sent furious glares at Lin Yun. But since they were now on the stage, they didn’t dare to make a move with so many eyes around.

“The test has now come to an end. Anyone with ten Spiritual Sword Beads can join my Sword Sect. So please take a few steps back, and those who collected a hundred Spiritual Sword Beads can stay behind. The saints will pick their disciples amongst you!” Elder Jue Chen said as he looked at the crowd.

His voice was soft, but it was no less than a rumble in everyone’s ears. Even Lin Yun couldn’t help opening his eyes because the saints were finally going to pick their disciples.

The six saints observing from the clouds since the beginning of the ceremony descended. Their appearances caused an uproar because it was simply unthinkable for six saints to appear at once. Even in the Ancient Barren Domain, it was practically impossible for one to meet with a saint. It was hard to meet Samsara Edict Realm experts, not to mention saints.

When Lin Yun glanced at the six saints, he couldn’t help feeling a little disappointed. He inwardly sighed. He had no idea why, but he felt terrible at this moment. At this moment, he knew that his disappointment was greater than he had imagined. It turned out that it was his wishful thinking all along. But since the Radiant Sword Saint saved him back on the Ninth Heavenly Path, he would repay it to the Sword Sect.

Lin Yun could feel an itch coming from his hand and lowered his head to see Lil’ Red licking his hand. Seeing that Lil’ Red really considered itself a cat, Lin Yun couldn’t help wearing a faint smile on his face that made him feel better.

He smiled because Lil’ Red could see that he was disappointed. Wearing a gentle smile, Lin Yun rubbed Lil’ Red on its head as the latter closed its eyes and enjoyed Lin Yun’s caress.

When Ye Ziyun saw this scene from the Radiant Snow Clan’s party, she couldn’t help being stunned. Everyone else was looking at the six saints, and Xiahou Yan was no exception. After all, saints from Ancient Saint Clans rarely showed themselves, not to mention that this determined if they could become the disciple of a saint. So they naturally didn’t dare to be careless.

But here was Lin Yun, playing with his cat. Then again, Ye Ziyun had to admit that Lin Yun looked really gentle when he played with the cat, and she could see the gentleness on Lin Yun’s face. The more Ye Ziyun looked at him, the more she asked herself if she was worse than a cat. Lin Yun was so gentle to a cat, but he actually hit her?
