Chapter 1644 - Great Boost In Strength

“Catch!” When the Azure Dragon Lord’s palm landed on Lin Yun’s back, boundless origin energy poured into Lin Yun’s mind, and Lin Yun instantly shone brightly.

Lin Yun could immediately feel his blood boiling like magma while raging violently with thunderstorm energy. Enveloped in a thunderstorm, Lin Yun shone brightly with a golden radiance.

“Circulate your cultivation technique and prepare to undergo your tribulation.” Jiang Ling’s voice resounded beside Lin Yun’s ears.

When Lin Yun sat down, he circulated the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon to devour the energy that Jiang Ling sent him. After he refined it, all of that energy poured towards his violet palace before forming into dragons that charged at the fourth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm’s bottleneck.

“The opportunity you received today is too great, especially the Blue Dragon’s Divine Blood. It increased your foundation tenfold, so your fourth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm will be extremely dangerous. But your future path in the Dragon Pulse Realm will be smooth.” Jiang Ling said.

“So as you digest your dragon bloodline in the future and cultivate the Blue Dragon Skybreaking Art, your physique will be able to bear the tribulation, regardless of your foundation. It is so much so that you can reach the limit of the Dragon Pulse Realm that not many people could achieve even in ancient times. Today, big brother will open the path for you!” His voice echoed within Lin Yun’s ears.

As the Azure Dragon Constellation disappeared in the sky, an ominous thundercloud was being formed. Lin Yun closed his eyes and broke through his bottleneck with external help. But with his eyes closed, he couldn’t sense anything in the outside world. He could only feel his strength growing swiftly.

As various phenomena appeared in the hall, the terrifying tribulation couldn’t descend. Thus, it couldn’t harm Lin Yun at all, so he easily made it through his tribulation. It was way easier than his three previous tribulations.

As time passed, the fourth pulse gradually formed within his body before expanding like a river. As for his tribulation, it didn’t exist at all. With the Azure Dragon there, no one could harm Lin Yun, not even heaven and earth.

Laughing aloud, Jiang Ling’s hand landed on Lin Yun’s shoulder while his other hand easily smashed apart the lightning in the sky. He then reached out, and a dragon claw stabbed into the clouds.

“Arghhhh!” A scream echoed from the clouds. The ominous beast that had manifested from the tribulation was crushed to death under that claw. As Jiang Ling’s hair fluttered in the wind, Lin Yun clenched his fist, and the ominous beast was destroyed.

Right then, the fourth pulse finally formed within Lin Yun’s body, with his cultivation reaching the pinnacle fourth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. This was good news, and a smile finally appeared on Jiang Ling’s face.

But Lin Yun wasn’t happy, and his heart was filled with pain, instead. At the same time, two tear droplets rolled down his cheeks and fell onto the ground.

“Interesting. Swordsmen will cry as well?” Jiang Ling’s body became even more illusory, but he maintained his smile without any sorrow in his eyes.

“Big Brother!” After Lin Yun made it through the tribulation, he stood up and wanted to grab Jiang Ling’s hand.

But Jiang Ling’s arms had utterly disappeared. Jiang Ling smiled, “Don’t feel bad about it. Everyone in the world will die. In the Divine Dragon Era, everyone only chases after our dreams, not longevity. So death is another dream…”

But before the Azure Dragon Lord could finish, his body finally disappeared. Lin Yun could only watch this and couldn’t say anything. He wanted to hear from Jiang Ling, saying they would meet again if they were fated. After all, he had just taken Jiang Ling as his big brother. But now, they would never be able to meet again.𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Four hours later, when Lin Yun’s emotions finally calmed down, he began to ponder his current situation. The dragon origin in his violet palace contained remnants of thunderstorm attributes, and that was because of Jiang Ling’s azure dragon saint origin.

“Let me stabilize my cultivation first. Being at the pinnacle fourth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, it shouldn’t be an issue for me to face Qin Tian, who’s at the fifth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm.” Lin Yun suppressed the sorrow in his heart because he still had to lead the Sword Sect’s disciples out of this place and take revenge for the blood feud two decades ago.

He was still bearing the responsibility of his master and sect. So he couldn’t allow his emotions to get the best of him. Thus, he continued to cultivate, refining the remaining azure dragon saint origin and see if he could make a breakthrough in his Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon.

Two days later, Lin Yun successfully reached the fifth stage in the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon under the azure dragon saint origin. The area above his dragon origin ocean was filled with Dragon-Phoenix Sword Aura, and there were over a thousand strands.

His sword aura formed into images of heavenly dragons and divine phoenixes chasing after each other, significantly boosting his dragon origin. Suddenly, a sword vibration echoed from Lin Yun’s brows, and a mighty sword aura swept out from him.

This was an extremely oppressive energy. Lin Yun’s sword aura swiftly formed into a sword with a bell ringing around it. This was a sign that his Heavenly Dome Sword Intent had reached lesser mastery.

Golden sword rays appeared on the roof as they entered Lin Yun’s sword intent in his brows. When the golden sparkles entered his mind, they significantly strengthened his two sword souls within his ocean. Even if he only took a small step in reaching the lesser mastery, this still considerably strengthened his sword intent.

“The breakthrough in my Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon actually brought my Heavenly Dome Sword Intent to lesser mastery. This is really a surprise.” Lin Yun muttered to himself.

“Carefree 9 Swords—Wind Sword Form!” Pouring his dragon origin into his finger, Lin Yun’s hair began to flutter in the wind, and an ancient ‘Wind’ word was instantly formed.

The saint runes of arrays began to appear on the surrounding walls withstanding the power of the ancient ‘Wind’ word. But even so, the entire hall still kept shaking violently.

This made Lin Yun’s face change. When he turned to look at his fellow martial brothers and sisters, who were still sleeping, he breathed a sigh of relief. It was great that they weren’t implicated in it. The four elemental sword forms were still one step from reaching complete mastery. But with a breakthrough in his cultivation, sword intent, and sword sutra, his attacks could even tear through space.

“Senior brothers and others are still asleep. So let me cultivate well.” Lin Yun didn’t waste any time. In the Blue Dragon Saint Palace, it should be more effective than the outside world for him to practice the Carefree 9 Swords, stabilize his cultivation, and sword intent.

After spending another three days, Lin Yun finally reached complete mastery of the four elemental sword forms. It was so much so that he even tried practicing the ninth sword form several times.

“Let me see the power of the four elemental sword forms after reaching complete mastery!” Lin Yun stood up and used his fingers as a sword to write an ancient ‘Wind’ word in mid-air.

As his boundless dragon origin fused with his Heavenly Dome Sword Intent, it formed into an ancient ‘Wind’ word. When that ancient word collided with the wall, it caused many saint runes to shatter.

“If I execute this attack with the Flower Burial Sword, I might be able to leave some damage to the wall.” Lin Yun pondered, but he didn’t dare to try it. After all, he wasn’t sure what would happen if he damaged this place without the Azure Dragon Saint Lord.

“Wind God Order, Blue Dragon’s Divine Blood, completely unsealed Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella, Thunderstorm Zither, Burning Moon Wine, and the Azure Dragon Skybreaking Art…” Lin Yun sorted his thoughts, and his emotions gradually became grave.

Big Brother said he didn’t have anything for him, but he gave him a lot. Any single one of them would cause an earthquake if the news got out, not to mention the Firmament Saint Cloth that Jiang Ling had given him back on the Heavenly Path.

Lin Yun casually sat down and started playing the Thunderstorm Zither. He often played music with Su Ziyao back in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, so he wasn’t unfamiliar with the zither. But when he started playing the zither, he could no longer stop, and the sorrow in his heart gushed out along with this music.

A long time later, Lin Yun’s fingers gradually slowed down, and he was done playing a song. But just when he was about to stop, Lin Yun gently strummed, and all his sorrows gushed out along with the last note, forming into a dream within Lin Yun’s heart.

What Jiang Ling said was right. Death was equivalent to a new dream. Holding onto the Wind God Order, Lin Yun’s face became grave because this was a token that signified him becoming the new Azure Dragon Lord, accepting all the forces of the Azure Dragon’s lineage in the Kunlun Realm.

“Who’s playing the zither? It’s noisy!” Gongsun Yan’s voice resounded as he slowly opened his eyes. But when he woke up completely, he exclaimed, “Wait… When was I asleep?”

“Oh my god, what the hell is going on?” Gongsun Yan no longer dwelled on it for another moment because he was shocked to discover another dragon pulse within his body. His bloodline also contained a trace of the azure dragon’s blood, and his soul had undergone a baptism. He could sense that his comprehension had risen to a whole new level.

Not long later, Ye Ziling and the others all woke up and discovered their changes. Gu Ruochen exclaimed, “Junior Brother Lin, what’s going on?”

Since Lin Yun had already stowed all of his treasures away, he said, “I just woke up too, and I also have no idea what happened. Perhaps the Azure Dragon is blessing us.”

Jiang Ling’s identity was too shocking, so it was best for him to keep it a secret. If disclosed, it would harm his fellow martial brothers and sisters.

“Everyone, let us thank the grace.” Mu Xueqin went down on her knees to the Azure Dragon in the starry sky. Everyone else did the same and went down on their knees.

“Thank you, Lord Azure Dragon!” They didn’t know that their benefits came from Jiang Ling, but they were sincere when they expressed their gratitude, kowtowing to the Azure Dragon Constellation in the sky three times.

“Are there other opportunities here? Perhaps the Wind God Order is also here!” Gongsun Yan said.

This made everyone else tempted as they began to look around. But they failed to find anything. After all, the Azure Dragon Lord, Jiang Ling, was the opportunity here. As for those secret treasures, saint elixirs, or martial techniques, they should probably be in the dragon head palace, and this meant that Qin Tian probably had a huge harvest.

An Liuyan turned to look at Lin Yun and felt that he probably hid something from them because he was too composed. Most importantly, from the feeling of her White Dragon Bone, she could sense that Lin Yun was giving off an extraordinary aura, and Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon Saint Physique seemed to have changed. But with her relationship with him, she naturally wouldn’t ask him about it.

“We have already received a lot this time. So don’t be greedy and prepare to quickly leave this place.” Mu Xueqin said.

Gu Ruochen nodded, “We should leave this place soon. As for the treasures we obtained on this trip to the Ancient Barren Battlefield, we have to hand them to the sect. If we can fully digest our harvest this time, the Sword Sect can catch up to the Profound Sky Sect in ten years!”

Everyone was also excited when they heard that.
