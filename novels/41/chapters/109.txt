Chapter 110 - Path of Bones

The fifty miles around the Heavenly Flame Peak were barren. Only hot, cracked ground existed. If someone was looking from above, it would seem like a black spot in the middle of the Sky Hibernation Mountains that should be covered in woods. It was a lifeless spot that radiated heat.

Carrying the sword box on his back, sweat started to drip down him. Raising his head, he saw that the Heavenly Flame Peak was still some distance away.

Wiping his sweat, Lin Yun mumbled to himself, “I have really underestimated the Heavenly Flame Peak’s terror…”

Fortunately, he had the Fiery Demon Physique, so the temperature wasn’t too unbearable to him. And if the heat became too unbearable, Lin Yun still had the Violet Sacred Frostfire from the sword box.

Since the flame belonged to the Violet Ice Sparrow that could even ignore the Flame Vein’s heat, the Heavenly Flame Peak shouldn’t be a problem.

Half an hour later, two silhouettes came out of the woods, it was Chief Liu and Mo Ping. The two had a shock on their faces as they took a few steps back. They did not dare to step into this crimson barren land.

“That filthy beast actually led us by the nose!” cursed Mo Ping while he looked at Lin Yun’s silhouette.

“Are you sure that his cultivation is only in the third orifice of the Xiantian Realm?” Chief Liu asked.

“I’m sure about that. However, that brat’s spiritual energy is unusually strong. I’m sure that he’s reaching the limit of his cultivation technique.” Mo Ping gnashed his teeth when he recalled his exchange with Lin Yun.

“Then it’s fine,” scoffed Chief Liu, “he will definitely die in the Heavenly Flame Peak with his cultivation in the third orifice of the Xiantian Realm. Even the two of us don’t dare to go up without cultivating the sect’s Golden Flame Art, not to mention a brat like him.”

When Mo Ping thought about the horrifying legend of the Heavenly Flame Peak, he sinisterly smiled, “It looks like we won’t have to dirty our hands to get rid of him.”

“Alright, this matter has ended. Continue searching for the Dragoncloud Fruit. It’s a mission that Senior Brother Mei has given us. We have already mobilized everyone from the branch, so we can’t waste time on this trifling matter.” Chief Liu waved his hand to leave.

“But the Dragoncloud Fruit will definitely be guarded by demonic beasts and I’m afraid that our strength might not be enough…” Mo Ping locked his brows together. He could feel a headache assaulting him whenever he thought of the mission.

“Let’s talk about that when we find it. As for the demonic beasts, Senior Brother Mei has his own means. But if we can’t find it before he arrives, we will be in deep trouble.”

The two already considered Lin Yun to be dead. Before leaving, Mo Ping turned around and cursed, “It’s best if that little bastard drops into lava and burns to ash!”

As Lin Yun approached the Heavenly Flame Peak, he could feel an immense pressure on his body. However, he did not protect himself with the Violet Sacred Frostfire. He wanted to make use of this opportunity to temper himself.

He had considered his trip up the peak as a form of training. Through this form of training, he was slowly bringing out the potential of his Fiery Demon Physique.

“Skeletons?” Lin Yun saw a set of bones on his path that were nearly burned to ashes. If it wasn’t for the clothes, Lin Yun would’ve considered those burnt rocks.

Lin Yun’s face changed. He suddenly recalled that he had seen similar skeletons along the way, but he had never noticed it in the past. He was under the impression that those were just rocks, but this person had clearly died recently, which was why the clothes were still around.

“Is this path made of bones?” Lin Yun looked down the peak in shock.

The Heavenly Flame Peak was known to everyone in the Azure Sun County as well as the nearby counties. The Heavenly Flame Peak was known to produce high-quality Lava Core.

Xiantian Realm cultivators constantly visited the Heavenly Flame Peak and ended up creating this path of bones.

“This corpse should’ve died a week ago during the lava rain…” Lin Yun’s heart began to waver. He was hesitating if he should find another volcano. After all, this Heavenly Flame Peak was a little too scary.

If he made a mistake, then his corpse might contribute to this path of bones too. The brutality in the path of cultivators was revealed before Lin Yun for the very first time.

Lin Yun’s face radiated with a red glow. Beads of sweat fell from his forehead and his eyes had lost their focus.

Drip! Drip! Drip!

Lin Yun held his head down. His sweat was dripping onto the ground, evaporating in the next second. His gaze fell onto the ring of hair that wrapped around his pinky.

“We will meet again in the future…” That was what Su Ziyao left behind. Would it really progress as what Senior Hong had said? He would be killed by Su Ziyao?

Lin Yun’s eyes gradually grew firm and he balled his fists together. He raised his head to look at the peak, and this time, he had no hesitation in his eyes. So what if he died here?

Rustle! Rustle! Rustle!

Lin Yun gnashed his teeth and powered his way forth, with the path of bones leading him.

Ascend the summit… Ascend the summit… Lin Yun only had one goal in his eyes, that was to ascend the summit. If he couldn’t even reach the summit, getting the Lava Core would be a pipe dream.

Rumble! Rumble!

Rocks started to fall off the peak abruptly. The rocks were shrouded in flames and fragments broke off the large rocks. It was like an avalanche that rolled down the peak.

“How troublesome.” smiled Lin Yun bitterly. But his eyes burned with fighting intent. There was no hesitation to cower. In the split second when the rocks were about to bury him, Lin Yun balled his fists and threw his punches out.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The rocks were shattered by his punches, raising clouds of dust. Relying on his fists, Lin Yun cleared a path before him. Explosions resounded out as the rocks were smashed apart by his punches. However, there were simply too many rocks.

Undying Vajra Seal!

Lin Yun’s hands joined together, forming seals just before he was about to be buried.

Boom!

A ring of dazzling flames swept out from Lin Yun’s hands. Lin Yun tapped his feet on the ground gently, avoiding the danger due to his mobility.

When he raised his head once more, he could vaguely see a group of people seated at the summit. They were Xiantian Realm cultivators who climbed the summit.

“I’m nearly there.” rejoiced Lin Yun. He increased his speed and dashed through the path of bones. Although there were several more waves of landslides, Lin Yun easily dealt with them.

Half a month later, Lin Yun finally saw the summit that was just a jump away from him. There was a huge crater at the center of the Heavenly Flame Peak, flowing with blazing magma. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Quite a few people here.” Lin Yun looked at the surroundings, there were at least three hundred people.

Opposite of him were many cultivators who weren’t in his sight because they were seated down.

When Lin Yun sensed briefly, he was shocked to notice that the weakest was in the fifth orifice of the Xiantian Realm. The aura emitting from them was strong, which meant that their cultivation technique had reached a high level.

Although the progress in their cultivation technique might not be comparable to his, which was only one stage from complete mastery, their cultivation technique was at least in greater mastery.

It meant that the advantage he had over the quality of his spiritual energy was nonexistent against these people here. Then again, this was probably the minimum requirement for anyone to reach the summit.

Those who were closer to the crater were stronger and their aura was more terrifying. Lin Yun could even see an old man in the seventh orifice of the Xiantian Realm, seated a hundred meters away from the crater. His face was dyed red by the radiation of the crimson light.

“Let’s go up.” Lin Yun gnashed his teeth and jumped onto the summit.

Swish! Swish! Swish!

When he reached the summit, many people directed their gaze over to him.

“Looks like there’s a newcomer.”

“He looks pretty young. I wonder which county he is from…”

Among the muttering discussion, someone suddenly exclaimed out, “My heavens! He’s only in the third orifice of the Xiantian Realm!”

When that exclamation rang out, everyone in the summit directed their eyes over.

“Youngsters nowadays are truly fearless.”

“He simply has no regard for his life to ascend the Heavenly Flame Peak at such a young age…”

“Did no one tell him that your cultivation needs to be at least in the fifth orifice of the Xiantian Realm?”

Several voices rang out and they looked at Lin Yun. Their curiosity from before had instantly turned into ridicule.

That old man in the seventh orifice of the Xiantian Realm also looked at Lin Yun. A cold sneer briefly rose on his lips before he closed his eyes.

Lin Yun smiled bitterly and kept his silence. He looked around and wanted to find a place to rest. But suddenly, a voice sounded out, “Hey, Lil’ brother, you can sit here if you don’t mind.”
