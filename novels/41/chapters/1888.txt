Chapter 1889 - Sound of Dao

Most people were concerned with the sacred flame that Ye Qingtian would receive. After all, Ye Qingtian’s earlier performance had drawn much attention, and many people were ‘concerned’ about him.

The six grades were the Sage Flame, King Flame, Saint Flame, Saint Sovereign Flame, Great Saint Flame, and Saint King Flame. The Sage Flame was the lowest grade, equivalent to ancestors taking pity on you. So those who obtained the Sage Flame were placed in an awkward position, and it was no different from being shamed in public. It was an old tradition to be shamed in the conferring ceremony if you obtained a Sage Flame.

Whoever obtains the Sage Flame would be a laughingstock, and the peak they came from would also be mocked. The King Flame was the minimum to be acknowledged, but those with King Flame couldn't be accepted as a saint’s disciple.

Only those who obtained the Saint Flame could be considered outstanding, possessing a wisp of possibility to become a saint’s disciple and be considered monstrous geniuses. Those with the Saint Sovereign Flame could be considered a genius of the century, receiving praises from all over. The Great Saint Flame was rare; anyone who obtained it would instantly become the hot potato amongst saints, wanting to take them in as a disciple.

As for the Saint King Flame, it had been centuries since it last appeared. Based on Ye Qingtian’s performance, many people were optimistic about him obtaining the Saint Sovereign Flame, and there was a small possibility of him obtaining the Great Saint Flame. After all, Lin Yun had grasped the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent, enough for him to pull the distance with the other saint disciples.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

An exclamation suddenly resounded. When Luo Cheng opened his eyes, he obtained two specks of the Saint Flame from the golden and silver fishes. Everyone could see that his cultivation was rapidly rising, and a powerful aura swept out from him.

“Luo Cheng might have lost to Ye Qingtian, but he can still be considered a genius.”

“Ha. Ye Qingtian was just lucky to receive help from his clan’s seniors. In terms of talent, Luo Cheng is stronger than him!”

“That’s right—two specks of the Saint Flame. It appears that Luo Cheng has obtained a decent harvest.”

Luo Cheng’s harvest made everyone from the Nether Orchid Courtyard happy, and even Bai Shuying nodded. As the chief disciple of the Nether Orchid Courtyard, Bai Shuying was naturally happy to see her junior brother obtaining a good result.

But for some reason, her gaze briefly stopped on Luo Cheng before turning to Ye Qingtian. She was curious about Ye Qingtian’s harvest. It wasn’t because she had fallen for him, but was genuinely curious.

On the altar, many peak masters were also waiting with anticipation.

“This feels great!” Luo Cheng stood up with a rosy face. When he got up, he glanced at Ye Qingtian and sneered. As long as Ye Qingtian’s harvest couldn’t be compared to his, it would prove that Ye Qingtian was a piece of trash. At that time, he could cleanse the humiliation he suffered. When he walked past Lin Yun, Luo Cheng purposely let out a cold snort filled with provocation.

“Hasn’t that fellow learned from his lesson? Hasn’t he suffered enough defeat at the hands of Senior Brother?”

“Just look at that disgusting smug on his face!”

“Senior Brother has the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent. How can he be inferior to Luo Cheng?” The Indigo Thunder Peak’s disciples unhappily muttered.

Chen Feng didn’t say anything because he was feeling nervous right now. After all, no one could determine the outcome before everything ends.

Half an incense of time later, most of the saint disciples were done. Most of them obtained the King Flame, with some obtaining the Saint Flame. There weren’t many who obtained the Sage Flame.

Right then, a dazzling golden radiance shone out from the altar with a beam of light soaring to the sky. The pillar of light reached eight hundred feet, and auspicious clouds appeared in the sky within a ten-mile radius. The golden fish representing the Heavenly Sword’s inheritance spat out a ball of golden flame the size of a fist. When the golden flame flew out, it descended onto the Dao Yang Palace’s Chen Jun.

“Saint Sovereign Flame!”

“Senior Brother Chen obtained the Saint Sovereign Flame! A monstrous genius has finally appeared at this conferring ceremony!”

“Look, Senior Brother Chen’s sword intent will make a breakthrough!” Exclamations resounded from the surroundings as everyone’s gazes fell on Chen Jun. Chen Jun’s Quasi-Heavenly Dome Sword Intent broke through the boundaries and reached the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent in a split second. This showed the benefits one could obtain from the Saint Sovereign Flame, but that wasn’t the end.

Chen Jun’s cultivation also made a breakthrough, reaching the fifth channel of the Profound Death Stage under everyone’s gazes. When he reopened his eyes, his face was plastered with a smile.

The Heavenly Dome Sword Intent… This is the actual Heavenly Dome Sword Intent? Chen Jun inwardly muttered. He now understood how Lin Yun trounced him. After all, there was a massive difference between the Quasi-Heavenly Dome Sword Intent and Heavenly Dome Sword Intent.

But he had now grasped the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent, not to mention he also made a breakthrough in his cultivation. He was confident that he could win if he fought Ye Qingtian again.

“Dao Yang Palace’s saint disciple, Chen Jun, is grateful for the ancestors’ gift!” Chen Jun went down on one knee and kowtowed in the direction of the altar three times before leaving the altar. When he passed by the Indigo Thunder Peak’s disciples, he stopped and raised his head, “When the ceremony ends, I will fight with Ye Qingtian again. Isn’t it just the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent? I happened to have grasped it as well.”

Everyone from the Indigo Thunder Peak, including Chen Feng, immediately cowered and lowered their heads.

“Ha. A bunch of garbage.” Chen Jun sneered with disdain before leaving.

After he left, only then did the Indigo Thunder Peak’s disciples slowly raise their heads. “That fellow is too arrogant!”

“He obtained the Saint Sovereign Flame?! Doesn’t it mean that Senior Brother won’t be able to defeat him if he doesn’t obtain the Saint Sovereign Flame?”

“That fellow is too lucky. He even made a breakthrough in his cultivation!” Everyone from the Indigo Thunder Peak lowered their heads in depression after they became intimidated by Chen Jun’s aura.

Chen Feng whispered, “Don’t panic. Senior Brother is still on the altar!”

“Hahaha! Ye Qingtian is doomed!”

“Chen Jun is going to rise this time, making a breakthrough in his cultivation and sword intent.”

“Hehe, it might be thanks to Ye Qingtian. Without that loss and witnessing the power of the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent, he might not have been able to grasp the Saint Sovereign Flame!”

The golden radiance was a hundred feet, and the auspicious cloud reached ten miles. Chen Jun’s Saint Sovereign Flame had caused an uproar outside, bringing the atmosphere in the conferring ceremony to a new height.

Everyone was waiting to see what level of sacred flame Ye Qingtian could obtain, and many people began to lose their patience.

As time gradually flowed, more people began to leave the daofield. Before they knew it, Ye Qingtian was the only person left on the altar, while everyone else had received their sacred flame. Even those with a weaker talent have obtained a Sage Flame, but many people have lost their patience when dusk came.

“Weird. Even if his talent is terrible, he should at least obtain the Sage Flame.”

“Heh, who knows?”

“Didn’t I say that Ye Qingtian is fortunate? His cultivation and sword intent don’t belong to him.”

“How can the ancestors possibly bestow any inheritance to someone like him? His qualification as the saint disciple should be taken from him.”

“Ye Qingtian, stop wasting time and get down!”

“Come down!” More people began to echo, and their voices soon formed into a wave. After all, Ye Qingtian sat there for a long time. The conferring ceremony started in the afternoon, and dusk was already arriving.

Even the peak masters on the altar had doubts on their faces.

“In my opinion, Ye Qingtian must have an issue.” The Wind Origin Quasi-Saint spoke up. “His cultivation and sword intent might not belong to him but instilled into him by the seniors of his clan. In addition to his vile character, it’s not surprising that the ancestors don’t want to bestow him with any sacred flame.”

“Although there isn’t a precedent, it doesn’t mean this is impossible…” The other peak masters echoed.

“Saint Elder, this might be a sign that the ancestors have determined that Ye Qingtian cannot become a saint disciple.”

“This isn’t a small issue. The ancestors are angry, and this is no different from being disrespectful to the ancestors!”

More voices echoed in agreement, making the Indigo Thunder Peak Master nervous. He said, “Saint Elder, let’s wait a little longer!”

Looking at the anxiety on the Indigo Thunder Peak Master’s face, the Wind Origin Quasi-Saint rejoiced in his heart.

But then, Saint Elder said, “Let’s wait for another half an incense of time. If the ancestors don’t accept him, I’ll take him in.”

The Indigo Thunder Peak Master felt relieved and said, “Thank you, Saint Elder!”

The other peak masters were shocked because Saint Elder held too high a hope for Ye Qingtian.

“Silence!” Saint Elder raised his head and roared, suppressing the surrounding voices.

With that, everyone died down. No matter how unhappy they were with Ye Qingtian, none dared to stand against Saint Elder.

But as time passed, Lin Yun stood unmoving and completely isolated from the outside world. When the time was about to end, the Indigo Thunder Peak Master became increasingly nervous, constantly wiping the sweat on his head.

The other peak masters also whispered amongst each other, finding this situation strange. But only Saint Elder was quietly waiting.

“Saint Elder, time’s up,” the Origin Wind Quasi-Saint said.

Right then, the two fishes sank on the altar, and the Heavenly Dao Sacred Flame was extinguished. The sky suddenly became dark. This scene shocked everyone as a terrifying aura spread out from the depths of the altar.

“What’s going on?!” Everyone was shocked because they had never seen this scene before. Just when everyone felt uneasy, sounds of dao echoed from above the sky of the altar.
