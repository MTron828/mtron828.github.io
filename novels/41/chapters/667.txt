Chapter 668 - You’re Not Worthy

Everyone clearly heard Lin Yun’s voice. It was practically unheard of that someone dared to compete with Qing Ruoyou, especially this backgroundless Lin Yun. In the eyes of everyone, Lin Yun was truly an insignificant figure since he came from the Great Qin Empire.

Even if Lin Yun had defeated Feng Xun, they only thought that he was slightly stronger than Feng Xun. But the Skymound City’s foundation ran deep, so Feng Xun was a nobody. At most, Feng Xun would only cause a small ripple in everyone’s eyes and he would be swiftly forgotten.

This was the Thunder Prefecture, so the geniuses were extremely prideful. If it was someone else, they might have gotten a better evaluation. However, everyone in the Skymound City was used to being absolute geniuses that held others in contempt, so Lin Yun was nothing in their eyes.

But it was precisely this Lin Yun who broke the limit when even the various forces had backed out of the auction.

Qing Ruoyou frowned her brows and swept a glance at Lin Yun. Her pupils were filled with chill and she questioned him, “Can you even afford 810,000 third grade spiritual jades?”

Luo Yu was also looking at Lin Yun as it wasn’t a small amount. He naturally didn’t have to consider Qing Ruoyou as she had the Indigomoon Elysium behind her. But if Lin Yun wanted to compete, he naturally had to take out enough spiritual jades.

“Since I dared to place a bid, I naturally have the money to pay for it,” said Lin Yun as he tapped his interspatial pouch. In the next second, over eight thousand fourth grade spiritual jades piled up before him like a mountain that caused a huge uproar in the plaza.

“Fourth grade spiritual jades again!”

“Just who the hell is he?” Many people were staring at the pile of fourth grade spiritual jades in disbelief.

Luo Yu’s heart was throbbing violently as he instructed someone to collect the spiritual jades before he smiled, “Young Master Lin is truly generous. You can keep the Divine Indigo Radiantstone for now. Is there anyone who wishes to break the limit?”

After taking the fourth grade spiritual jades, Luo Yu pushed his hand and the Divine Indigo Radiantstone flew into Lin Yun’s hands.

When Lin Yun held the Divine Indigo Radiantstone, his hands sank from the weight. He couldn’t help taking another look at Luo Yu, who sent it over to him with one hand. From this alone, he could infer that Luo Yu wasn’t simple. Simultaneously, Lin Yun realized that he was clearly acting when he was pretending to lift the shrine in difficulty.

But no one was bothered by it as they looked at Lin Yun with a complicated gaze. Their eyes contained complex emotions of shock and disdain because he was clearly intending on competing with Qing Ruoyou.

“Lin Yun, I can let this matter go if you deliver the Divine Indigo Radiantstone to me. I can make it up to you with two times the amount. What do you think of giving me, Xiang Tianhe, face?” asked Xiang Tianhe as he looked at Lin Yun.

Others didn’t know, but he knew that Qing Ruoyou wouldn’t lower herself to compete with Lin Yun. She was an aloof genius ranked thirty five. Not even some of the seven kings and seven elites could enter her eyes, not to mention an insignificant figure who wasn’t even in the Dragoncloud Ranking.

For her to compete with Lin Yun naturally meant lowering herself and there was no way she would do that. So Xiang Tianhe had no choice but to stand out. Furthermore, he didn’t believe that Lin Yun had the guts to compete with him. This was why he wore a smile on his face as he was certain that Lin Yun knew what to do.

“Sorry, but I’m not familiar with you,” said Lin Yun coldly as he glanced at Xiang Tianhe.

Xiang Tianhe’s smile froze on his face as he nearly spit up a mouthful of blood. Suddenly, killing aura began to flash in his eyes.

However, Lin Yun didn’t even bother to look at Xiang Tianhe. Xiang Tianhe might be a genius on the inner ranking, but right now, he was no different than Qing Ruoyou’s dog. So why should he give Xiang Tianhe face? Furthermore, he wasn’t well acquainted with Xiang Tianhe, so why did he have to give him the latter face?

“Impudent!” A roar sounded out from the Skycloud Sect. Next to Feng Xun, a genius looked at Lin Yun with his eyes flashing coldly, “Lin Yun, you should know what’s best for you. Have you seen anyone here dare to compete with the four major clans and Skycloud Sect? No!”

“No one dares to compete with us. We’ve already given you face by giving you the Five Acute Lightning Crystals, so don’t push it. The Divine Indigo Radiantstone isn't a treasure that someone like you can have. Hand it over to Princess Ruoyou now and apologize!”

The person who was berating Lin Yun was Feng Xun’s senior brother, Yang Pengyu. He was ranked seventh among the Skycloud Sect’s core disciples. His cultivation was already in the lesser Yin-Yang stage and he had the ability to be in the inner ranking. The moment he spoke, everyone’s enmity was directed towards Lin Yun.

“Well said, Brother Yang. It’s hard for Princess Ruoyou to make her way to Skymound City. If this matter gets out, it would be a slap to our faces. Brat, hand over the Divine Indigo Radiantstone if you want to live. You have no idea who you’re dealing with!” said a genius from the Jin Clan.

“Give up. That’s not something you can have,” said another genius from another clan.

“Brat, there’s a limit to everything. The four major clans and Skycloud Sect already gave up on this. Don’t make us continue or else all of your efforts would have been for nothing…” saoid Chen Xiong of the Chen Clan.

“So much crap. But it’s a pity that I won’t compromise since I’ve already made up my mind. You think you can frighten me with those words? Who do you think I am?” Lin Yun snorted. He didn’t need the Divine Indigo Radiantstone, but Su Ziyao did.

He had made a promise back in the Great Qin Empire, so he was determined to obtain this Divine Indigo Radiantstone. In fact, no one could snatch it from him. He had promised to reach her no matter how high up she was. Therefore, he would never hesitate since he had chosen to take the path.

Lin Yun had shocked everyone with his words. No one expected Lin Yun to be so stubborn when facing the four major clans and Skycloud Sect. But in the eyes of many, Lin Yun’s behavior was arrogant, which made the geniuses sneer coldly. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Although everyone was welcomed to bid for the items in the auction, no one dared to compete with the four major clans and Skycloud Sect. As for competing with Qing Ruoyou, that was an even more foolish act.

“Who the hell do you think you are? You’re just a sword slave,” said Qing Ruoyou as her pupils flashed coldly like a sword that streaked across the sky.

A sword slave? Everyone turned to look at Lin Yun upon hearing Qing Ruoyou’s words. When they saw the mark between Lin Yun’s forehead, their expression suddenly became playful. They thought that Lin Yun had a huge background, but it turned out that he was only a sword slave.

Disdain began to appear in many people’s eyes as Lin Yun wore a playful smile.

“Indeed, I was a sword slave. But I’m not afraid of my identity in the past. If you think that you can humiliate me with that, you must be dreaming,” said Lin Yun indifferently as he looked at Qing Ruoyou. “Come and fight me if you want it. If I lose, you can have the Divine Indigo Radiantstone. If that really happens, I will have no opinion about it.”

This was his will as a swordsman. Since he had openly fought for it, he would only back down if he was defeated. Bowing to someone was never his style.

“Fight with me? Are you even qualified?” Qing Ruoyou seemed to have heard a laughable joke as her pupils flashed with mockery.

“Ruoyou, let me do it. Today’s matters are my fault. I’ll make this sword slave beg for forgiveness,” said Xiang Tianhe as he stepped forward.

“So what if you defeat him? He’s just a sword slave.” Qing Ruoyou glared at Xiang Tianhe before she continued, “I’ll let you know that your pride is worthless before me. Is anyone here willing to fight on my behalf in Skymound City?”

“Skycloud Sect’s Yang Pengyu is willing to fight for you!”

“Skymound City Chen Clan’s Chen Xiong is willing to fight for you!”

“Skymound City Qin Clan’s Qin Ziluo is willing to fight for you!”

“Skymound City Gu Clan’s Gu Yunfei is willing to fight for you!”

“Skymound City Jin Clan’s Jin Ling is willing to fight for you!”

In just one moment, all the geniuses were laughing at the unbelievable scene unfolding in front of their eyes. Nothing like this had ever happened in the past, so the entire plaza began to boil with excitement.
