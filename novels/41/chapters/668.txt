Chapter 669 - I Don’t Know How Immense Is The Sky

Qing Ruoyou’s words brought the atmosphere of the auction to a whole new level. The Skycloud Sect’s Yang Pengfei, Chen Clan’s Chen Xiong, Gu Clan’s Gu Yunfei, Qin Clan’s Qin Ziluo, and Jin Clan’s Jin Ling were famous figures in Skymound City. In fact, they could probably make it into the top ten in this year’s Draconic Banquet.

Normally, they would compete with each other. However, just for today, their target was Lin Yun. Most of them were local geniuses of Skymound City, but when they looked at Lin Yun, their gazes were playful. Logically speaking, Lin Yun could be considered a genius since he defeated Feng Xun.

He would have a position even if he was ranked among the geniuses in the Skymound City. This was because the way that Lin Yun defeated Feng Xun to obtain the Five Acute Lightning Crystals had left a deep impression on everyone. But so what?

Lin Yun shouldn’t have competed with Qing Ruoyou. Qing Ruoyou was practically perfect in the hearts of those in the Thunder Prefecture. She had both beauty and strength that was paired with an icy temperament. Because of this, many people had become her admirers.

Even if she didn’t speak up, many people would still be willing to fight for her. After all, this was an opportunity for them to get on her good side.

Lin Yun was foolish in everyone’s eyes. He was already overestimating himself by obtaining the Five Acute Lightning Crystals and offending people he couldn’t afford to offend. There was no question that he would be crushed and humiliated today. They had no idea what was going through Lin Yun’s mind.

Then again, how could they understand Lin Yun’s thoughts? The reason why he competed for the Divine Indigo Radiantstone was because of Su Ziyao. Qing Ruoyou’s strength might be deep and unfathomable, but there was no restriction in this Death Auction. He had the Indigoflame Thunderwhip as his trump card and he was confident that he had a 30% chance of winning.

Since he had a 30% chance, why shouldn’t he take the gamble? But he had no idea what was going on with Qing Ruoyou that caused her to be so enraged.

The geniuses from the various forces all looked at Qing Ruoyou with their eyes blazing. All of them wanted to fight on Qing Ruoyou’s behalf as this was a rare opportunity for them to get on her good side.

As for Lin Yun? He was just a sword slave who defeated Feng Xun by luck in everyone’s eyes. Feng Xun was a nobody in the eyes of these geniuses, and they were confident of defeating Lin Yun. All of them were geniuses who had reached the Yin-Yang stage and someone like Feng Xun couldn’t compare to them.

As fighting spirits blazed from all of them, Qing Ruoyou swept her glance before looking at the Skycloud Sect’s Yang Pengfei. He was ranked seventh among the core disciples and had reached the Yin-Yang stage a year ago. Now that one year had passed, it was only natural that he had become more powerful.

Even the older generation in the lesser Yin-Yang stage couldn’t be his opponent, so Lin Yun would probably be defeated by a single attack. This person was the first who reprimanded Lin Yun. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Yang Pengfei, I didn’t get your name wrong, right?” Qing Ruoyou looked at Yang Pengfei.

Yang Pengfei’s heart began to throb violently when he heard Qing Ruoyou calling out to him. He couldn’t help having joy flash across his pupils. It would be easy for him to step on Lin Yun. Simultaneously, the other forces’ geniuses had disappointment in their eyes when they saw that Qing Ruoyou had chosen Yang Pengfei.

Yang Pengfei’s gaze landed on Lin Yun with mockery in his pupils and disdain in his smile. He snickered, “A puny sword slave like you dares to compete with Princess Ruoyou? Let me teach you a lesson today about how immense the sky is!”

But to everyone’s surprise, Lin Yun actually replied to Yang Pengfei with ridicule, “Wow, look at you wagging your tail. It’s just sad that your owner might not even acknowledge a dog like you.”

“Haha, I have no time to waste with you.” Yang Pengfei had rage blazing in his heart despite his face staying the same. However, his gaze turned cold as he drew the spear behind him. With his origin energy fluctuating within his body, a blazing aura enveloped his spear as the tip of the spear blazed with flames.

When the flames exploded, it unleashed a heatwave into the surroundings like a ferocious wolf. Disdainfully, Yang Pengfei stepped forward and walked towards Lin Yun. As he walked over slowly, his aura grew even more powerful. With his last three steps, his aura reached a terrifying height like a volcano that was about to erupt.

It felt as though his spear could even burn the air when he swung it. This made everyone look at Lin Yun with pity in their eyes since he probably had no idea of his current situation. But it was Lin Yun’s fault for provoking Yang Pengfei. Looking at Yang Pengfei’s actions, it was clear that he was accumulating his power to stab Lin Yun to death with a single strike.

“You’re not going to draw your sword?” Yang Pengfei was only three steps away from Lin Yun and his aura had reached its limit. He said coldly, “I only need to take another step to kill you. At that time, no one in the world can save you.”

“Come and give it a try then,” said Lin Yun coldly as he wore a playful smile.

“You’re courting death!” Yang Pengfei roared as the spear in his hand began to buzz. But when he took a step forward, Lin Yun also stepped forward.

Iris Sword Sutra—Dazzling Moment!

A powerful sword intent exploded out from his body and soared into the sky, causing the entire plaza to tremble violently. In the sky, the outline of an Iris Flower slowly condensed before revolving above Lin Yun’s heart.

In that split second, everyone’s heart sank as they could feel a powerful pressure. Everyone’s faces changed as they looked at Lin Yun.

But Yang Pengfei was even more shocked as he fearfully discovered that there seemed to be an invisible wall standing before him. No matter what, he couldn’t take a step forward.

In just one step, Lin Yun released a boundless sword aura that soared into the sky and embedded itself into many people’s minds. Yang Pengfei was shocked by this and unleashed all the origin energy within his body without holding back. As flames blazed violently, the scarlet glow slowly revolved behind him like a golden halo.

He raised his feet and immediately felt better. Smirking, Yang Pengfei started thinking to himself to downplay Lin Yun’s power. So what if Lin Yun had a powerful sword intent? Did Lin Yun really think he could defeat Yang Pengfei with such a poor foundation?

But right at this moment, Lin Yun took another step forward.

Azure Dragon Enneaform—Triform!

A dragon roar echoed out from Lin Yun’s body when he took the last step. The Azure Dragon Mark began to shine on his chest as the thirty lightning runes unleashed an ancient and ferocious roar. This instantly made the sky turn dark as Yang Pengfei was forced backwards. Yang Pengfei immediately turned pale and threw up a mouthful of blood.

Lin Yun had only used two steps to heavily injure him, which left the crowd in disbelief.

“What’s going on?” Xiang Tianhe exclaimed beside Qing Ruoyou.

Even the geniuses of the great sects were in disbelief. Simultaneously, a terrifying thought began to rise in their minds. Could it be that Yang Pengfei was going to lose to a sword slave?

When they thought about it, their faces became ugly. Yang Pengfei’s face had turned ashen as he had completely panicked. He knew that he couldn’t lose no matter what.

Just when Yang Pengfei was about to move, Lin Yun formed a seal with one hand and took a step forward. After he formed an ancient seal in his hand, he unleashed the Seven Slaughtering Seal.

In the next second, Lin Yun’s killing aura multiplied seven times, making Yang Pengfei feel like he was in a swamp. When Yang Pengfei sensed the pressure, he was shocked to discover that he actually couldn't move.

Under the pressure from the killing aura, the golden halo behind Yang Pengfei suddenly shattered.

First step - Dazzling Moment. Second step - Triform. Third step - torrential killing aura.

As Lin Yun’s hair fluttered in the wind, he looked like a fiend god who came from hell. When his killing aura merged with his sword intent and azure dragon energy, Yang Pengfei was in pain as if there were countless pests biting every single part of his body.

“You’re merely a piece of trash. I don’t need my sword to defeat you. Do you see what I mean? So what if I don’t know how immense the sky is today? Kneel for me!” Lin Yun slammed his right hand, which had the seal, downwards. When his palm landed on Yang Pengfei’s head, Yang Pengfei was forced to his knees and threw up a mouthful of blood.

The immense impact caused cracks to spread out on the stage as blood from Yang Pengfei’s knees began to soak the ground.
