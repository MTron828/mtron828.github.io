Chapter 1316 - Calm Before The Storm

Zhang Ting and Qin Tian were afraid that they would lose sight of Lin Yun. They were quick, but they were tired to the point that they were gasping for air at this moment. This made them feel incredible. After all, they had reached the Elysium Core Realm, but they couldn’t even catch up to Lin Yun’s speed.

“Lin Yun, you should’ve previously been in seclusion, right?” Qin Tian asked.

“Yeah,” replied Lin Yun.

“Then, I bet you don’t know about Flower Burial. His information has been spreading like wildfire lately, and everyone on the Profound Wither Island knows about him. He’s too terrifying. He snatched a Dragon Saint Pellet and Quasi-Saint Origin from the hands of the Emerald Jade Manor, Heavenly Blade Pavilion, and the Thunder Sect.” Qin Tian briefly paused before he continued, “Many people even suspect that Flower Burial might be the champion of the Ninth Heavenly Path. There are rumors that he was someone who slew five Realm Sons on the Heavenly Path!”

Lin Yun was silent and didn’t interject Qin Tian’s conversation.

“There are people who say that he died in the hands of the Nether Divinity Clan. But looking at it now, it appears that he has been hiding in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect,” sighed Zhang Ting. “That’s a heaven-defying transcendent who slaughtered his way through the Heavenly Path. Even if he doesn’t shine now, he’ll shine sooner or later in the future. At that time, no one will be able to stop him.” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“A transcendent who slaughtered his way out of millions of geniuses. There’s naturally no way that he’s weak. Throughout history, transcendents who didn’t die early all rose in the Kunlun Realm. The champions of the eight other Heavenly Paths have already unleashed their luster in the Kunlun Realm, not to mention that Flower Burial is the strongest champion in the history of the heavenly paths,” said Qin Tian.

The two began to share their information about Flower Burial. They wanted to tell Lin Yun that although the big sects might be targeting him on the surface, it was actually a scheme from the Profound Sky Sect against Flower Burial.

Not only was Qin Cang ranked first on the Empyrean Ranking, he was also the direct descendant of the Nether Divinity Clan. He could even compete for the position of patriarch in the future. Since he knew that Flower Burial has shown up, he naturally had to kill him. After all, Flower Burial’s public appearance was a provocation to him.

The two were trying to comfort Lin Yun and tell him not to be impulsive. At the very least, the disciples of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect were safe before Flower Burial shows up.

“Senior Sister Mu is strong and has prestige. As long as she shows up, the eight big sects definitely won’t dare to do anything.” Qin Tian further continued, “Senior Sister Mu also has a lot of friends, and there might be other powerful sects coming to help. So remember not to be impulsive.”

The two of them naturally wouldn’t believe Lin Yun when he said that he had a good temper. If he went there, they knew that there would be a river of blood, and he wouldn’t go easy on the big sects.

But Lin Yun merely maintained his silence and didn’t say a single word.

This made Qin Tian and Zhang Ting curious. In the end, they couldn’t help asking, “Lin Yun, you don’t seem to be interested in Flower Burial.”

“I am Flower Burial,” replied Lin Yun.

Qin Tian and Zhang Ting were briefly stunned before they laughed, “Stop joking. There aren’t many people who saw Flower Burial, but the information about his appearance has spread out. He has silver long hair and carries a silver sword box, not to mention that his sword technique is absolutely brilliant. Most importantly, he is proficient in the dao of music and has grasped the noble tune!”

The two naturally wouldn’t believe that Lin Yun was Flower Burial. After all, they had nothing similar to each other. But Lin Yun didn’t refute their words and looked around. He could sense that the surrounding celestial aura was becoming even thinner.

“The restriction is becoming weak. The great saint origin might appear soon.” Lil’ Purple’s voice resounded.

Lin Yun knew that he had to be quick. He suddenly came to a stop with Qin Tian and Zhang Ting looking at him in confusion. But before they could respond, a pair of golden wings unfolded behind Lin Yun, and the two of them soared into the sky.

“Lead the way.” Lin Yun initially wanted to head there by himself, but thinking about it again, he would be able to save more time with the two of them leading the way. Just like that, they bolted like lightning across the horizon. The two of them had widened their mouths in shock because Lin Yun’s movement technique was a little too fast.

At the same time, all the powerful sects outside the Profound Wither Island could also sense that the seal on the island had weakened. Greater Elysium Core Realm experts tried to see if they could enter the Profound Wither Island again. But even if the seal had weakened, the restriction left behind by Profound Wither Great Saint did not.

When they saw that the path still wasn’t open, Samsara Edict Realm experts stood out and took out their saint artifacts. Their attacks managed to break through the restriction and manifested into a mirror outside the storm around the island. This time, they succeeded and the scenes on the Profound Wither Island were reflected in the mirror.

“Quick, look! What’s that? Qin Cang seems to be fusing with something.” Someone exclaimed. They could see Qin Cang was refining a black demonic lotus at the heart of a withered lake. The saint rune in the demonic lotus looked like a demonic dragon dyed in blood. It was an extremely precious Blackflame Demonic Lotus.

.

“The Blackflame Demonic Lotus!” Many Dragon Pulse Realm experts were shocked when they saw the lotus. They could see the terrifying power contained within the lotus, and the origin saint rune actually contained a wisp of the true dragon’s rhyme.

“That Blackflame Demonic Lotus was probably stained by a true dragon’s blood!” The elder of a powerful sect exclaimed.

When everyone heard what he said, their hearts throbbed violently and some Samsara Edict Realm experts couldn’t help taking a few more looks. The Blackflame Demonic Lotus was rarely found in the outside world, but it was actually found by Qin Cang. It was too luxurious for him to engrave it on his elysium core, and he would be invincible in the Elysium Core Realm if he succeeds.

“Let’s look at the other transcendent geniuses!” They soon found a white-clothed figure, it was Sword Sect’s Sikong Zhou. Sikong Zhou was seated there, emitting a saint dragon aura and was enveloped in a dazzling sword ray. That was the Saint Dragon Sword Physique that most people knew of in the Ancient Barren Domain, and this dazzling scene appeared only because of his shocking talent in the sword. He was taken away by the Sword Sect when he was only six years old.

Before him, there was an origin saint rune forming into a sword and emitting a dazzling light. This made everyone exclaim once more because the Profound Wither Island was too unbelievable. Even a sword dao origin saint rune could be found there.

The transcendent geniuses of the eight powerful sects had their own encounters, but they soon figured them out. After all, the powerful sects probably had information on the Profound Wither Island, or this coincidence was a little too much.

“Look, who’s that?!” Right at that moment, there was a figure chasing after a bolt of lightning. The bolt of lightning was emitting a dazzling light.

“It’s Dugu Yan. He seems to have found the Azure Thunder Sacred Flame!”

“His luck is a little heaven-defying. He’s from the Azure Thunder Sect. His sword path and cultivation technique are related to the Azure Thunder Sacred Flame. If he manages to acquire a primal Azure Thunder Sacred Flame, his strength might reach a heaven-defying height!” The elders of the Thunder Sect were excited. After all, Dugu Yan was known to be invincible in the sword, and he could be comparable to transcendent geniuses.

Even if he didn’t find an origin saint rune, he wouldn’t be any weaker than those transcendent geniuses after grasping the Azure Thunder Sacred Flame.

Suddenly, a series of exclamations resounded once more when a woman obtained an origin saint rune in the valley and was refining it. She was extraordinary, but she wasn’t the genius of powerful sects or big sects.

Aside from that, there were a lot of people gathered outside the valley. They were the eight big sects who were preparing to siege the silver valley. The valley was enveloped in silver snow, and zither music was resounding from the snow, paired with an array to stop the eight big sects. Under the zither music, the array unleashed a terrifying power that sent everyone flying back.

But those big sects weren’t in a hurry. They were gathered together, waiting with Greater Elysium Core Realm experts wielding saint artifacts. The artifacts were shining brightly, and anyone could tell that they were extraordinary. There was even a possibility that they might be monarch saint artifacts that created all sorts of phenomena.

“Why aren’t the Greater Elysium Core Realm experts doing anything? What are they waiting for?”

“Something’s weird. Just what force is required that the eight big sects have to join forces.”

“Don’t tell me it’s the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, right? After all, someone from the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect previously snatched a saint elixir from the eight sects.”

“But the scale of this siege is a little too big. So there might be a secret behind it.” Everyone could only see what was going on, and they had no idea what previously happened. But this instantly captivated their attention.

This scene was simply too bizarre, and they were all curious about what were they waiting for. In the camp of the Sword Sect, Feng Jue’s face was cold with a killing aura flashing through his pupils. Lifting his sword, he said, “I’ll go have a talk to the seniors of those people.”

But Lin Zhen glared at him and barked, “Come back!”

This made Feng Jue unhappy, but he ultimately didn’t move. Lin Zhen was a Sword-Bearing Elder, and even if his master was the Radiant Sword Saint, he also didn’t dare to act with impudence before him. Then again, it was also because he couldn’t beat Lin Zhen. If he insisted on disobeying Lin Zhen, then he would only receive a beating.

“Whatever happens on the Profound Wither Island is between the juniors, and you’re in no position to interfere. So why are you so anxious about it?!” Lin Zhen said.

“But that’s the daughter of my junior brother!” Feng Jue raged. “If something happens to her, I’ll look for the eight big sects and not a single one of them can escape, no matter who stands out!”

Ye Ziling was Jian Jingtian’s daughter, and he knew how bitter Jian Jingtian had been. If anything happens to Ye Ziling, then Feng Jue would definitely lose it.

Lin Zhen briefly hesitated before he said, “With Mu Qingqing on the Profound Wither Island, she won’t stand and do nothing.”
