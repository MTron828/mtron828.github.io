Chapter 517 - Grievance

Gu Teng, who was hovering in the sky, started to emit a terrifying aura. It was impossible to fly in the sky without reaching the Heavenly Soul Realm, but hovering in the sky shortly was possible. But the reason why Gu Teng could do it probably had something to do with the spiritual runes around him.

Standing in the sky, Gu Teng looked down at Lin Yun, “You’re somewhat capable since you can force me this far. But you still don’t understand the power of a quasi-overlord force.”

Gu Teng was already enraged after he was forced back time and time again by Lin Yun. He no longer decided to charge forward as his hands began to change. Along with his hand signs, the spiritual runes around him were slowly appearing along with blazing flames.

“That’s the Infernal Mountain and River Painting!” The other disciples exclaimed. The Infernal Mountain and River Painting was an extremely powerful spiritual diagram among second grades. After all, Mo Ling could defeat a Violet Palace Realm opponent with it while she was in the Profound Martial Realm.

“This is the end!” Gu Teng laughed as the spiritual runes intertwined and formed a painting. In the next second, a flaming river of a hundred feet came pouring down at Lin Yun.

The power coming from it could even injure someone in the greater Yin stage, so it would be difficult for Lin Yun to deal with it if he didn’t have any sword intent. Furthermore, this was only a second grade spiritual diagram. If it was a third grade spiritual diagram, how powerful would it be? What about the mysterious divine ability then? The Heavenly Province Academy’s foundation was truly deep and they were worthy of being known as a quasi-overlord force.

But the Infernal Mountain and River Painting created by Gu Teng was still lacking. Just when the sea of flames were about to devour Lin Yun, Lin Yun unleashed his xiantian sword intent that rang in everyone’s ears. This made everyone stand up from their seats with shock in their eyes.

This was their first time witnessing the complete xiantian sword intent. When Lin Yun brought out his xiantian sword intent, he was so dazzling that no one could look at him straight. Within Lin Yun’s violet palace, the Iris Flower bloomed and filled his body with origin energy.

“Luminous Moon!” Lin Yun roared and he slashed his sword down. The silvery ray quickly condensed into a bright moon and came crashing down.

The radiance was too dazzling and no one could imagine what horrifying talent in sword dao was needed to create such a phenomenon. Under Lin Yun’s sword, the sea of flames collapsed in an instant and Lin Yun came out unscathed.

“Xiantian sword intent!” Gu Teng’s eyes radiated with shock before he roared, “Condense!”

The fire spiritual runes began to gather together and formed into the Infernal Mountain and River Painting once more. This time, the painting seemed to be even stronger. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Myriad Frost!” Lin Yun shook his wrist and stabbed the Flower Burial Sword at Gu Teng. The Flower Burial Sword began to emit a terrifying chill and everything within the sword’s path was frozen solid.

Before the fire spiritual runes could gather together completely, they were frozen at the crucial moment. With another roar, Lin Yun swung his sword out and the frozen flames began to collapse.

Standing in the sky, Gu Teng threw up a mouthful of blood with his face pale. When he looked at the disdain in Lin Yun’s eyes, his eyes blazed with rage, “Screw you!”

The origin energy fluctuation coming from Gu Teng was shocking as he charged at Lin Yun. In just the blink of an eye, Gu Teng had already arrived before Lin Yun. But just before he could unleash his attack, Lin Yun’s Flower Burial Sword was placed at the center of his eyebrows.

As long as Lin Yun pushed his sword slightly further, the sword would dig into Gu Teng’s head and Gu Teng would lose his life. This was the third time Lin Yun did this and all the disciples were shocked.

Having all his origin energy pent up within his body, Gu Teng’s pale face turned red. His eyes were bloodshot with deep reluctance in his eyes.

“You think you can escape?” Lin Yun smirked as he whipped the Flower Burial Sword on Gu Teng’s face. The slap was resounding and everyone could hear it. Gu Teng threw up a mouthful of blood as he spun in the air several times before falling down on the ground.

When Gu Teng struggled back on his feet, he looked at Lin Yun with disbelief. Right at this moment, he was completely dejected. He no longer had his arrogance from before. “How can it be… I actually lost to a piece of trash who came from the Great Qin Empire…”

“The foundation of a quasi-overlord force? What a joke…” Lin Yun sheathed his sword with mockery and disdain in his eyes. He had humiliated Gu Teng by sending him flying with a slap, but Gu Teng deserved it. Lin Yun couldn’t be bothered with him initially after Mo Ling left, but Gu Teng came looking for a beating. So Lin Yun naturally didn’t mind stepping on him.

“Good luck,” said Lin Yun as he turned around.

Damn it! Damn it! Gu Teng’s face was grim as he looked at Lin Yun’s silhouette while he punched at the ground. The surrounding disciples were quiet because no one had expected this outcome. They never expected that Gu Teng would lose so terribly even after bringing out his spiritual diagram. Lin Yun’s attainment in his sword technique was shocking.

Outside the Nightcloud Hall, Gong Ming and Bai Yi both chased after Lin Yun. They both had different gazes.

Lin Yun asked, “You two aren’t afraid that you’ll be implicated in this matter?”

Gong Ming scratched his head and smiled, “Brother Lin’s strength has shocked me greatly. I can’t believe that you’re from the Great Qin Empire. But you have to be careful about Gu Teng’s elder brother.”

Bai Yi also nodded her head in acknowledgement, “Big Brother Lin, Gu Teng’s elder brother is known for being over protective and he’s also famous for being brutal among core disciples. Let’s discuss this matter with Senior Sister Liu.”

“I know that he definitely has the backing to act so arrogant in the inner sect. But since I’ve decided to take action against him, I've naturally considered that factor. The two of you don’t have to be worried for me,” smiled Lin Yun.

Everyone only had one life and Lin Yun didn’t want to live his life filled with grievance. Since he was being bullied, then he naturally had to fight back. The worst outcome would probably be getting kicked out of the academy, but that didn’t matter much to Lin Yun.

The Flower Burial Sword was a sword that buried both flowers and people alike. The moment he drew the sword for the very first time, he was already destined to be on this road. He would rather bury himself than to live his life with grievance.
