Chapter 2145: Eternal Purgatory

Mu Qianjue swept his gaze through the nine Dragon Mountains before heading towards the Azure Dragon Path. At this moment, Mu Qianjue still had the idea that Ye Qingtian was targeting him again. He was conflicted as he looked at the other Divine Dragon Paths, which were almost occupied by the other champions of the Heavenly Paths.

Some thrones even had two champions, so he didn’t have much choice. He would either have to return to the Indigo Dragon Path or choose another Divine Dragon Path. The former would be courting death because he was just chased out by Ye Qingtian, while he gave up on the latter with just a glance.

In the end, he didn’t have many choices left and could only go with the Azure Dragon Path. Although He Xuanjing was on the Azure Dragon Path, he could be considered the weakest amongst the champions of the Heavenly Paths. Otherwise, He Xuanjing wouldn’t have picked the Azure Dragon Path.

After making up his mind, Mu Qianjue shattered the Azure Dragon Path’s barrier, flapping the black and white wings as he descended while being enveloped in saint radiance. When he released the empowered Quasi-Saint’s aura, many cultivators on the Dragon’s Head of the Azure Dragon Path became nervous.

On the throne, He Xuanjing squinted, surprised that Mu Qianjue would choose the Azure Dragon Path. Did the latter think that he was a pushover?

“Get lost!” Mu Qianjue yelled as he waved his hand, sending Ye Feng flying away and occupying his spot.

Ye Feng threw out a mouthful of blood and rolled on the ground before he was caught by Dao Yang Holy Son. The faces of Bai Shuying and Ye Xin changed as they soared to the sky, but they were caught by the aftermath and took several steps back before they managed to stabilize themselves.

Ye Feng’s face became ashen as he glared at Mu Qianjue. He wanted to say something, but he threw out a mouthful of blood before he could speak. He roared, “Mu Qianjue, you can’t beat Ye Qingtian, so you’re taking it out on us?!”

“You? You’re not worthy,” Mu Qianjue said disdainfully. He was defeated by Ye Qingtian twice in a row, so he naturally had to reestablish his prestige after arriving on the Azure Dragon Path. He didn’t know who Ye Feng was because he couldn’t be bothered. Only the other champions of the Heavenly Paths could catch his attention and other geniuses were no different from ants in his eyes.

As he spoke, he casually attacked with the Phaseless Divine Seal. A giant palm empowered by saint dao enveloped everyone there, and Ye Feng already fell before the palm descended. Under the great pressure, Ye Xin and Bai Shuying’s faces changed as well since this was the power of a dragon spirit martial technique.

This was the pressure that Ye Qingtian was facing earlier, and the champions of the Heavenly Paths were stronger than anyone had imagined. The faces of the other geniuses from the Eastern Desolation changed since they initially thought that Mu Qianjue wouldn’t be that strong, and this was why he was defeated by Ye Qingtian. But looking at it again, that wasn’t the case. It was simply because Ye Qingtian was too strong.

He Xuanjing was also surprised when he saw this scene, before he wore a playful smile. Didn’t Mu Qianjue know that these people were disciples of the Heavenly Dao Sect?

In the crucial moment, the Dao Yang Holy Son stood out, releasing a golden radiance like a dazzling son as he faced the palm head-on.

Under a huge collision, the Phaseless Divine Seal shattered and the other cultivators from the Eastern Desolation quickly stood up to avoid the shockwave with grave expressions. When they looked at Mu Qianjue, their eyes were filled with rage, but they didn’t dare to say anything about it.

Mu Qianjue had achieved the outcome he wanted when he looked at everyone’s gazes from the surroundings. This was the respect they should show to the champions of the Heavenly Paths.

“The Great Divine Phaseless Art is really powerful.” He Xuanjing exclaimed from the throne. He then wore a playful smile and said, “I thought you’re afraid of Ye Qingtian, but it turns out that you didn’t put him in your eyes at all. To make a move against the disciples of the Heavenly Dao Sect the moment you arrive on the Azure Dragon Path, you have impressed me, Mu Qianjue!”

Mu Qianjue’s face changed upon hearing that, and his face sank when he looked at the disciples of the Heavenly Dao Sect. He only wanted to establish his prestige and had no intentions of targeting the Heavenly Dao Sect. Then again, he didn’t believe that Ye Qingtian would come to the Azure Dragon Path.

This was because there was another champion of the Heavenly Paths on the Azure Dragon Path aside from him, and it would mean Ye Qingtian would have to face two?champions of the Heavenly Paths if he came. So Ye Qingtian would be insane if he came.

Upon thinking about it, Mu Qianjue’s expression returned to normal, and said as he glanced at the Heavenly Dao Sect’s disciples, “I thought everyone from the Heavenly Dao Sect should be as strong as Ye Qingtian, but it looks like I’m greatly disappointed.”

He Xuanjing patted on the armrest of the throne, and smiled, “Are you so sure that Ye Qingtian won’t come to the Azure Dragon Path?”

Mu Qianjue’s eyes flashed upon hearing that, before he coldly said, “He Xuanjing, you better worry about yourself. I’m here to tell you that there’s a difference even amongst the champions of the Heavenly Paths. As for Ye Qingtian, so what if he comes? You think I’m afraid of him?”

He was arrogant as the black and white wings flapped, releasing a great pressure.

Right then, a shattering sound was heard as a familiar sword ray illuminated the surroundings while a familiar figure landed beside those from the Heavenly Dao Sect.

“Ye Qingtian!” Everyone’s faces changed as they exclaimed when they saw the newcomer’s face. Even He Xuanjing was surprised because he didn’t expect that Ye Qingtian would really come.

Hearing the surrounding exclamations, Mu Qianjue turned around and saw Ye Qingtian examining the injuries of his fellow disciples. He was dumbfounded when he saw Ye Qingtian coming to the Azure Dragon Path.

“Ye Qingtian, are you really going to make trouble with me?” Mu Qianjue was trembling from the anger.

After Lin Yun made sure that everyone from the Heavenly Dao Sect was fine, he breathed a sigh of relief. When he heard what Mu Qianjue said, he couldn’t help speaking out, “Is that what the champion of a Heavenly Path should say?”

“I have already given you face by leaving the True Dragon Path, anyet d you still want to chase after me?” Mu Qianjue said coldly.

Lin Yun was calm as he continued, “First of all, you were driven away by me. Secondly, you giving me face doesn’t mean that I will give you?face.”

He wasn’t polite as he ripped Mu Qianjue’s fa?ade off. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Ye Qingtian, I have given you an opportunity, so don’t blame me for it.” Mu Qianjue’s gaze gradually turned cold. He had been trying to avoid a fight with Lin Yun. But now that here was no way of retreat for him, he couldn’t be blamed for being ruthless.

Lin Yun looked indifferent as he replied, “I didn’t ask you to give me any opportunity right from the start. Come and fight if you want. I have nothing to say if you win.”

The winner takes all, and the strong would be respected. Lin Yun didn’t like Mu Qianjue’s tone. What did the latter mean by giving him an opportunity? Did he even need it? He could get what he wanted with his sword.

The aura that Mu Qianjue gave off was so terrifying that no one dared to look at him directly. On the contrary, Lin Yun smiled as he clashed against Mu Qianjue’s aura with his sword aura.

Champion of the Heavenly Path? Who wasn’t a champion as well? Did he need Mu Qianjue to give him face?

Mu Qianjue broke the silence as his wrist trembled and pushed his palm forth at Lin Yun. The palm reached Lin Yun the next moment, but it was a pity that it only hit an afterimage, which dissipated the moment it came in contact. This was because Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon Sword Heart could predict danger, and he easily avoided the attack by relying on the Divine Sunchasing Art.

Mu Qianjue had no changes on his face as the black and white wings flapped, executing the Phaseless Evil Eye aimed at Lin Yun’s chest. This palm looked ordinary, but it contained endless profundity. If someone else came in contact with this attack, their bodies would become stiff, their souls trembling.

Aside from that, this palm was even empowered by two greater daos, and countless phenomena began to overlap when Mu Qianjue pushed his palm forth. His attack was too fast to see. Even so, Mu Qianjue’s attack couldn’t even touch the corner of Lin Yun’s clothes.

“How can he still have such a fast movement technique under the Phaseless Evil Eye?!” He Xuanjing was shocked while sitting on his throne.

The other champions of the Heavenly Paths were also paying attention to this fight because they had already placed Lin Yun on the same level as them.

“Mu Qianjue, you can’t even touch the corner of my clothes, and yet you claim to have gone easy on me?” Lin Yun dodged Mu Qianjue’s attack again and stood on a floating beard on the Dragon’s Head.

Mu Qianjue stopped as he looked at Lin Yun and stowed the wings back into his body. In the next moment, black and white ink swept out. This time, the black ink contained death while the white ink contained life. It turned out that Mu Qianjue had grasped the Life-Death Martial Intent.

“Eternal Purgatory!” Mu Qianjue snorted as a purgatory appeared, manifesting into thousands of palms that flew at Lin Yun.

Lin Yun was surprised that Mu Qianjue had grasped the Life-Death Martial Intent, and this made him wonder if this fellow was related to the White and Black Emperors. Regardless if he was relying on the Great Divine Phaseless Art or the two emperors, the Eternal Purgatory was a fearsome attack as life and death revolved, manifesting into countless palms around him. No matter how Lin Yun tried to dodge, he couldn’t avoid the incoming attack.

As Mu Qianjue reached out, the black and white wings flew out from his body, manifesting into a metal chain that rushed towards Lin Yun’s heart.

Seeing this, Xin Yan and Bai Shuying became nervous with their faces changing. They were even prepared to make a move and aid Lin Yun.

“You have good potential, and you will become a top powerhouse in the future. But… you’re still too lacking now,” Lin Yun said without any changes on his face. He drew out the Flower Burial Sword and swung it.

In the mysterious dream space, the ancient lamp ignited as Lin Yun’s dual sword stars shone brightly and a sword ray flew out. Lin Yun didn’t use any skills this time, only pushed his sword intent to the peak, and he wanted to see how powerful the pinnacle of complete mastery of the Astral Sword Intent was like.

In the next second, the Eternal Purgatory began to shatter as the palms shattered before they could even get close to the sword ray. This made Mu Qianjue exclaim and he wanted to pull the chain back to block this attack.

When the sword ray and chain clashed, a hole was created on Mu Qianjue’s body by the sword ray and he was sent flying away, throwing out a mouthful of blood. It didn’t take long for him to fly off of the Dragon’s Head and start falling to the foot of the mountain.

Lin Yun flew out and grabbed onto Mu Qianjue before the latter fell off. He said, “Well, it turns out that I don’t need any opportunity from you.”

“Let go of me.” Mu Qianjue maintained his indifference despite having a pale face. This was his pride as the champion of a Heavenly Path.

“Sure.” Lin Yun let go and allowed Mu Qianjue’s body to fall.

The pressure on the Dragon’s Head was terrifying, and Mu Qianjue immediately regretted it. He wanted to reach out to grab on, but he couldn’t resist the dragon aura at all since he was heavily injured, and he couldn’t stop his body from falling.

Seeing this, Lin Yun leaped down the Dragon’s Head and pulled Mu Qianjue back, before casually tossing him to the side.
