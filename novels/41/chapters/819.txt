Chapter 820 - Demon Blade Zhu Qingshan

Just when everyone thought the fight was about to end, Jiang Ziye pushed her hands out. She didn’t even bother wiping her lips as she attacked once more. “Heavenly Cloudbreaking Palm!”

The dense clouds in the sky tore apart as a gigantic palm descended from the sky. The palm descended so fast that no one could react in time, including Yu Haotian. The ground exploded under her palm and waves rose along the lake. No one expected that Jiang Ziye had another powerful attack up her sleeves.

It was only a moment ago, but Jiang Ziye went from using one finger to a whole hand. However, her final attack made her face turn pale. Clearly, her aura was a lot weaker than before, but she still had fight in her eyes.

Suddenly, a radiant light exploded on top of the stage.

Soaring Indigomoon!

Everyone who cultivated the Indigomoon Sutra could manifest a purple moon. The moon that Yu Haotian manifested instantly destroyed the palm and unleashed a bright radiance. The moon was so bright that no one could look directly at it.

Jiang Ziye simultaneously unleashed a second round of attacks as if she already knew that the palm couldn’t do a thing to Yu Haotian. Dozens of silk cloths reached Yu Haotian in the blink of an eye and wrapped around him. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“What a powerful trump card!” The crowd exclaimed at Jiang Ziye’s true trump card.

Holding onto the other end of the cloth, Jiang Ziye tried to throw Yu Haotian off the stage. This was a clever trick, but it required Jiang Ziye to throw herself off with Yu Haotian.

However, when Jiang Ziye pulled the other end of the cloth, she was shocked to realize that she couldn’t make Yu Haotian move. The latter was like a mountain and wouldn’t budge no matter what.

“How is this possible…” Jiang Ziye was shocked. But before the shock in her pupils could dissipate, the restraints were shredded as Yu Haotian glowed purple. The surroundings turned dark as Yu Haotian became the sole source of light. Then, Jiang Ziye was sent flying as she threw up blood.

“Indigomoon Sacred Radiance!”

“It’s the Indigomoon Sacred Radiance! That’s the phenomenon that only appears after the Indigomoon Sutra reaches a high level. There are rumours that those who reach that level are invincible among those with the same cultivation.”

“How terrifying. It’s been over a thousand years since someone managed to reach that level.” Everyone was shocked by Yu Haotian’s strength.

“You really are outstanding since you forced me this much. If you were facing Yan Long’zi or Zhao Wuji, you might still have a chance of winning. It’s a shame you ran into me.” The dazzling purple glow lit up Yu Haotian’s face, giving everyone the feeling that he was a deity.

“Yu Haotian wins!” The judge announced. As the glow around Yu Haotian dissipated, he devoured half of Jiang Ziye’s profound amber aura. Then, he returned to the Indigomoon Elysium’s section, leaving everyone silent.

“Jiang Ziye’s trump cards were extremely powerful, but who would have thought that Yu Haotian would be so strong?”

“Everything is nothing before absolute strength. If they were evenly matched, Jiang Ziye would have won.”

“It’s a shame that this is only the tip of the iceberg to Yu Haotian’s strength. I bet he won’t need to use more than half of his strength for the remainder of the banquet.” The strength Yu Haotian had revealed was too shocking, which was unfortunate for Jiang Ziye. Although she was strong and hardworking, the only outcome before such strength was defeat.

This helpless feeling would make anyone feel despair. With Yu Haotian around, everyone else was relegated to being side characters. The destruction caused by this battle was so great that the Sacred Alliance had to send out a few Heavenly Soul Realm spiritualists to repair the stage and empower the array once more.

Taking advantage of this short break, everyone rested. The overlord forces had deep foundations, so they used this tie to ensure that their candidates were back in tip top condition.

Half an hour later, the next battle began with Zhu Qingshan and Bai Lixuan. Both of the fighters were considered dark horses, so they naturally had a lot of attention. Although Bai Lixuan lost to Zhao Wuji, the strength he displayed was strong.

Furthermore, Bai Lixuan’s lightning intent was completely suppressed when he faced Zhao Wuji. However, the outcome would be very different against Zhu Qingshan. So, he had an easier time fighting Zhu Qingshan because the demonic aura that everyone feared was nothing before his sword intent.

However, after a hundred moves later, the tide of the battle changed. Combining his Azure Dragon Sword Sutra and lightning sword intent together, Bai Lixuan’s figure blurred as sword rays enveloping the stage. “Clapping Thunder!”

“Soul Devour!” Zhu Qingshan calmly drew his saber and unleashed over ninety dark beams of saber intent. When he locked onto the phenomenon created by Bai Lixuan, he slashed his sword that manifested a devil. Facing the bolts of lightning and sword intent, the devil didn’t hesitate to devour everything.

“Blood Devour!” Zhu Qingshan sneered under his hood and unleashed his attack once more. His saber unleashed countless black threads that charged towards Bai Lixuan.

Bai Lixuan quickly covered himself with his origin energy to prevent the black threads from approaching him. When the black threads reached him, it felt as though they had come in contact with an iron blade. However, Bai Lixuan was shocked to discover that the flow of his blood had slowed down.

This scene was a little too abnormal. He had clearly blocked Zhu Qingshan’s attack, but his blood was still being devoured. Wearing a grave expression, Bai Lixuan pushed his lightning sword intent to the limit and turned all the black threads into ashes. But it was too late. One tenth of his blood had already been devoured. The sudden loss of blood made him feel dizzy and there was nothing he could do even if his sword intent was strong.

Taking advantage of the pause, Zhu Qingshan soared into the sky like an asura while he manifested a scene from purgatory. At the same time, his saber turned into the claw of an asura.

Although Bai Lixuan was able to withstand this attack, he was still sent flying as traces of blood leaked from his lips.

“Asura Seven Flash!” Zhu Qingshan stuck close to Bai Lixuan like a shadow. No matter how Bai Lixuan evaded, he couldn’t throw off Zhu Qingshan. Zhu Qingshan swung his saber seven times, and each attack collided with Bai Lixuan’s sword. Soon, Bai Lixuan’s hand went numb.

Bai Lixuan wanted to retaliate, but a black blade would slash at him whenever he moved. Zhu Qingshan’s attacks were too quick and ruthless.

Zhu Qingshan didn’t give Bai Lixuan any opportunity to turn the tables around. From the moment Bai Lixuan took Zhu Qingshan’s Blood Devour head-on, he was getting thrashed.

Ten moves later, Zhu Qingshan suddenly stopped. Bai Lixuan was baffled by the sudden pause as Zhu Qingshan removed his hood. With a calm voice, he declared, “You lost.”

In the next second, Bai Lixuan’s clothes exploded and three gashes appeared on his body. Each of his wounds were fatal, which left Bai Lixuan completely baffled. He had no idea when he suffered Zhu Qingshan’s attack.

When the audience saw this, fear filled their faces. They never saw Zhu Qingshan wound Bai Lixuan.
