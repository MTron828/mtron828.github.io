Chapter 1184 - Ice Phoenix Bracelet (2)

The city at night was brightly lit and full of people on the streets. Tonight, the butler of the Feng Clan’s manor and the little princess sat in a carriage, but neither of their faces looked good.

Throughout the entire journey, Butler Hong was nervous. Even as a Dragon Pulse Realm expert, he couldn’t maintain his composure. He would occasionally try to persuade the princess of the Feng Clan to think about things. Although she was annoyed, there was nothing she could do.

An incense’s time later, the carriage stopped before a pavilion. Butler Hong sent away the servants before he carefully led the princess into the pavilion. In an elegant room in the pavilion, was a massive table with a lady in white who wore a veil over her face. At this moment, she was sitting in the main seat.

When the door opened, the uneasiness on Butler Hong’s face disappeared as he cupped his hands with a fawning smile, “Hong Kun, greets Young Master Luo.”

At the same time, he jammed his elbow into the side of the princess of the Feng Clan. This made her face turn stiff as she spoke, “Feng Xiaoyu of the Feng Clan, greets Young Master Luo.”

But Luo Hua didn’t say a single word, making the atmosphere in the room tense. Right at this moment, Butler Hong coughed, making Feng Xiaoyu speak out unhappily, “I’m sorry. I didn’t know that Lin Yun was your friend, and I apologize for offending him during the day. I’m done with my apology now!”

Seeing that Luo Hua still didn’t speak, Butler Hong revealed a stiff smile and said, “I apologize for that. The third miss is young and doesn’t know manners. We really weren’t aware that Lin Yun was your friend. Otherwise, we wouldn’t have made things difficult for him.”

“I’m done apologizing. If you aren’t going to utter a word, then I’m going to leave,” said Feng Xiaoyu unhappily upon seeing Luo Hua’s silence. Butler Hong’s face changed with beads of sweat dripping down from his forehead. However, Feng Xiaoyu looked directly at Luo Hua with no signs of taking a step back.

“Have you ever seen someone apologizing while still on their feet?” Luo Hua raised her head lightly with a cold light flashing through her pupils. Immediately, the temperature in the room began to drop.

Hearing that, Feng Xiaoyu’s face instantly turned dark and she roared, “Impudence! You want me to kneel and apologize to you?! Who the hell do you think you are!”

When Hong Kun heard that, he was startled and began to tremble nervously. But Luo Hua fell silent as she ignored Feng Xiaoyu.

This made Feng Xiaoyu even more furious because she was the pearl of the family since her birth, and she had never seen someone so arrogant before. Completely enraged, she ridiculed, “If my grandfather didn’t ask me to apologize to you, do you think I would even bat an eye at you? Who the hell do you think you are? Are you wearing a veil because you’re ugly?”

But the moment she was done, Feng Xiaoyu received a slap on her face. She didn’t even see how Luo Hua slapped her, but it was so fast that her face was red before she realized anything happened.

“You dare slap me?!” Feng Xiaoyu flew into a rage and roared, “I’ll tear your face apart!”

But before she could even do anything, her right cheek was slapped as well.

“You’re courting death!” Feng Xiaoyu’s hair scattered as she was left feeling dizzy from the slap. Regardless, she charged toward Luo Hua like a madwoman.

As the third miss of the Feng Clan, she was the pearl in the family and the gem of the pavilion master. So her cultivation naturally wasn’t low. As her killing intent boiled, a powerful sword aura exploded out of her.

“Miss, no!” Hong Kun was completely left dumbfounded by this scene, but it was already too late to stop her.

This time, Feng Xiaoyu was sent flying away, throwing up a mouthful of blood in the process. Then, she collided against the wall. When she fell onto the ground, she threw up another mouthful of blood. However, she bravely stood back up and supported herself with the wall.

There was no other noise in the elegant room aside from Feng Xiaoyu’s heavy breathing. Hong Kun was also trembling by the side, but he didn’t dare to utter a single word. At many times, only those who were ignorant didn’t know how to be afraid, and only those who knew the story knew that the prestige of heaven couldn’t be violated.

As Hong Kun’s eyes were filled with fear, Luo Hua stood up and unleashed a terrifying aura. As all the wine on the desk exploded into dust, Feng Xiaoyu suddenly hovered into the air.

“No! No! No! Put me down!” At this moment, Feng Xiaoyu had finally panicked.

“Even the manor lord of the Hidden Sword Manor doesn’t dare to speak to me in this manner. You’re really bold when you’re just a small miss of the Hidden Sword Pavilion!” Luo Hua’s expression was still covered by her veil, but she sounded angry. When she finished, Feng Xiaoyu was sent flying out of the pavilion, creating a hole in the wall.

“The invitation!” Luo Hua looked at Hong Kun coldly.

“H-H-Here. We’ve already prepared it.” Hong Kun’s body trembled. As a Dragon Pulse Realm expert, he didn’t dare to be impudent before Luo Hua and he respectfully handed over the invitation.

Luo Hua took the invitation before casting a glance at Feng Xiaoyu, who was lying on the ground beyond the hole. Then, the silver bracelet on her wrist radiated and an ice phoenix flew out from the bracelet.

The bracelet was well crafted. Even Luo Hua, who had seen countless pieces of jewelry, was stunned by the breathtaking bracelet. She also knew that Lin Yun must’ve spent a lot of effort on this bracelet.

When she was done, she walked out of the room and towards Feng Xiaoyu. Feng Xiaoyu was crawling on the ground without even the courage to take a look at Luo Hua. At this moment, she finally realized that Luo Hua wasn’t someone that she could offend. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“D-Don’t come over here!” Feng Xiaoyu said as she cried out in pain.

Then, Luo Hua waved her hand to summon the bracelet over. When she held onto the bracelet, she could sense a wisp of chill gathering in her hand. Looking at it closely, she noticed that the details on the bracelet were vivid and well-crafted.

“Give it back to me!” Feng Xiaoyu panicked when she saw that the bracelet was taken from her.

But when Luo Hua raised her head, an immense pressure leaked out of her pupils that sent Feng Xiaoyu flying. Even though her nails were scratching against the ground, she couldn’t stop herself from flying away. In the end, she collided against the wall and threw out another mouthful of blood.

But she still didn’t give up and said, “Give it back! Give it back to me!”

“You’re not fit to wear this.” Luo Hua looked at her coldly and left with disgust flashing through her pupils.

Looking at Luo Hua’s back figure, Feng Xiaoyu’s pupils were filled with pain. When Hong Kun came out a long time later, Feng Xiaoyu asked, “Uncle Hong, who the hell is she!”

“Let’s not talk about it. It’s already done…” Hong Kun felt heavily relieved because this was the best outcome. Otherwise, not even Feng Xuanzi, the Hidden Sword Pavilion, or the Hidden Sword Manor could save Feng Xiaoyu.
