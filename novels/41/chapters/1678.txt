Chapter 1679 – Why Do You Have To Do This?

L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

With the third-grade Saint Spiritualist cultivation, Saint Tone, and the Thunderstorm Zither, it shouldn’t be an issue for him to face someone like Ma Qing in the future, even without using his trump cards.

“Thunderstorm Zither…” Looking at the Thunderstorm Zither on his lap, Lin Yun fell into deep thought. This belonged to Big Brother Jiang Ling, and it could be comparable to a Sovereign Saint Artifact if he could awaken the dragon soul within.

But he couldn’t sense the existence of the dragon soul. Even so, the power of this zither was already stronger than many saint artifacts just by manipulating the wind and lightning.

“It looks like this zither is the same existence as the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella with restrictions.” Lin Yun felt that he should spend more time getting used to it, or such a treasure would only go down the drain.

“Let’s go and collect the Heavenly Snow Lotus.” Lin Yun kept the zither and executed the Azure Dragon Saint Physique. As wind and lightning enveloped him, he soared into the sky and flew towards the Skyflowing Island.

It wasn’t too profound to control wind and lightning by relying on his Azure Dragon Saint Physique. Controlling the wind and lightning were the Azure Dragon’s innate abilities, to begin with. He did not need to use this in the past since he could use the Divine Sunchasing Art. But he couldn’t use it now. Then again, his speed was fast without carrying the Iris Sword Box behind him. It took him roughly four hours to arrive on the Skyflowing Island.

“I’m not any slower than when using the Divine Sunchasing Art now, and I didn’t pay much attention to the Thunderstorm Intent in the past. Azure Dragon can wield wind and lightning, to begin with. Now that my Azure Dragon Saint Physique has become stronger, along with my breakthrough in the Blue Dragon Skybreaking Art, I have to make good use of it.” Lin Yun decided as he noticed that he had quite a lot of means available to him.

In the past, his attainment in the sword path was too potent, allowing him to neglect everything else. Having his four dragon pulses damaged might be an opportunity for him.

When Lin Yun arrived at the Heavenly Star Pavilion with the Silver Moon Mask on, he noticed that the Heavenly Star Pavilion was closed and heavily guarded. He could also sense a terrifying aura from the Heavenly Star Pavilion.

The matters with the Blood Moon Sect haven’t ended yet. Lin Yun didn’t run into any hindrances along the way, and he was smoothly brought into the Heavenly Star Pavilion by Mo Ling’er to a secluded place.

“Young Master Lin, please wait here. Our Missy will be here shortly.” Mo Ling’er said before leaving.

This place was serene, and Lin Yun couldn’t sense a single person.

“Young Master Lin, you’re pretty on time.” An Liuyan appeared, wielding the Blood Moon Fan in her hand. Aside from the fan, she held onto a box with her left hand. When she got close, An Liuyan continued, “The Skyflowing Island is too remote, and I only managed to find four Heavenly Snow Lotus’ petals over the past three days. I hope that Young Master Lin won’t mind.”

Lin Yun inwardly rejoiced when he heard that because it was already a surprise that there were four Heavenly Snow Lotus petals. When he opened the box, he could see four petals that looked like blood jades, and they were exactly the same as Lil’ Purple had described.

“What’s the price?” Lin Yun asked.

“If you’re willing to tell me where you got the Blood Dragon Ginseng from, I can give them to you for free.” An Liuyan stared Lin Yun in the eyes.

Lin Yun instantly wondered if his identity had been revealed. The Divine Tortoise Transformation was said to be so great that not even saints could see through his disguise. He could already feel something wasn’t right when Luo Shuyi previously stared at him, but even An Liuyan started to probe him now, and this made him really depressed.

So the Divine Tortoise Transformation could conceal the eyes of a Saint and not women? But he tossed that aside because he naturally knew why An Liuyan would ask him that.

The reason he didn’t reveal his identity to her wasn’t because he didn’t believe her. He believed that she wouldn’t harm him, and An Liuyan would even do her best to search for Heavenly Snow Lotus for him along with the information about the Nirvana Pavilion.

But his identity was too sensitive and would spell great trouble should it be revealed. This was why he wasn’t willing to disclose his identity to An Liuyan. He replied, “There’s no need for that. If I want to lie, I can come up with a hundred reasons that Boss An won’t be able to see through.”

“Go on. You only have to look me in the eyes and tell me. I’ll believe anything you tell me.” An Liuyan’s emotions were a little agitated, and she took another step forth.

Taking a deep breath, Lin Yun took two steps back and replied, “Boss An, don’t do this.”

“You’re not Lin Xiao, you’re Lin Yun. Since we’ve met, why don’t you dare to meet me openly? Am I that untrustworthy in your eyes?” An Liuyan said with tears welling in her eyes.

Lin Yun had no idea how worried she was after he was sent away by Yu Qingfeng. To search for his information, she stayed on the Skyflowing Island for many days and was nearly captured by the Blood Moon Sect. An Liuyan didn’t care about that, but why wasn’t Lin Yun willing to meet her openly?

“Boss An, you got the wrong person.” Lin Yun replied calmly without any changes on his face under the mask. He continued, “Since we can’t deal with this transaction, I’ll be taking my departure, then!”

“Lin Yun!” An Liuyan placed the Blood Moon Fan against her neck. The edge of the fan was as sharp as a blade since it was an inheritance saint artifact. She only needed to exert some slight force, and she would have severely injured her neck. She continued, “If you leave now, I’ll take my own life. Anyhow, my life was saved by you back in the Dragon Remnant Astral Realm. If you go into hiding for a few centuries, I might still hold hope of meeting you again. You’re clearly standing before me, but you’re not willing to meet me openly? Am I that bad?!”

Lin Yun’s footstep paused, and he inwardly sighed. Without turning around, he replied, “Boss An is a Nine-Star Demon Venerable, and you can become the Demon Gate’s holy maiden by taking another step further. So why are you doing this?”

He reminded her not to give up the bigger picture for the smaller one.

“I don’t care. If you leave now, when can we meet again? Turn around. As long as you don’t leave, I’m even willing to become your maid and stay beside you!” An Liuyan’s voice sobbed. She held no extravagant hope for Lin Yun, but Lin Yun being so heartless hurt her significantly.

As she cultivated the charming technique of the Heavenly Demon Canon, people rarely treated her lightly. So she felt that Lin Yun was looking down upon her. They clearly met, but Lin Yun still wasn’t willing to meet her with his actual identity. Was he afraid that she would harm him?

“There’s no need for you to do as such. I’m not the person that you’re looking for!” Lin Yun shook his head and left.

But when he took a step forth, An Liuyan pressed the Blood Moon Fan closer to her neck, creating a wound with blood flowing out.

This made Lin Yun close his eyes, and his heart was in a mess. When he opened his eyes again, he turned around and appeared before An Liuyan, smacking the Blood Moon Fan away.

An Liuyan’s face was pale, but she wore a bright smile. Lin Yun didn’t say anything as he activated the Blue Dragon Bone. As waves of vitality surged, it swiftly healed the wound on An Liuyan’s neck. The injury wasn’t serious, but it still made Lin Yun’s heart throb. If he was one step slower, An Liuyan would’ve lost her head. No one could save her at that time, not even an immortal.

Letting out a sigh, Lin Yun sat down and removed his mask. Simultaneously, he also returned to his initial appearance with the Divine Tortoise Transformation.

“You’re really Lin Yun!” An Liuyan said, with her tone filled with joy.

“I’m starting to suspect if the Divine Tortoise Transformation is really that mysterious. How did you see through my disguise? If you made a mistake, you would be dead by now.” Lin Yun smiled bitterly.

“I won’t make any mistakes. I already confirmed your identity when you defeated Zhang Ying with your zither.” An Liuyan smiled.

“I refused to reveal my identity because I didn’t want to trouble you. It’s not because I don’t trust you.” Lin Yun said helplessly.

“I know, but I wanted to hear it from you personally.” An Liuyan’s smile became even denser. As a breeze blew, her tears disappeared, replaced by gentleness.

She knew Lin Yun’s heart already belonged to someone else, but she had a knot in her heart because she couldn’t expose her true thoughts. Now that she had revealed everything, she had undone the knot in her heart.

But her words left Lin Yun speechless.

“Young Master Lin, you’re angry?” An Liuyan didn’t dare to look at Lin Yun and lowered her head, which made her look even more charming. She looked as though she would have no complaints no matter how Lin Yun punished her.
