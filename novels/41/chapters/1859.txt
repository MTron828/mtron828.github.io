Chapter 1860 - Assault

On the ocean, Lin Yun coughed while struggling to get back on his feet, but the intense pain made the corner of his lips twitch as he took a deep breath. But before he could continue, he threw out a mouthful of blood, making his face even paler than before.

“It hurts…” Lin Yun gritted his teeth and tried his best to examine the severity of his wounds. The Myriad Scales Armor had caved in under Zhuge Qingyun’s palm. His ribs were cracked, and there were even some fine cracks on the Blue Dragon Bone. His heart might have burst under that attack if he didn’t have the Blue Dragon Bone.

But even so, he was in a serious condition because the Myriad Scales Armor had been shattered with ten-odd scales stabbing into his internal organs, and he had three dragon scales near his heart.

Whenever his heart throbbed, he would feel intense pain, and his entire body was bruised. It wasn’t because the Myriad Scales Armor wasn’t strong enough, but Lin Yun still couldn’t unleash the full power of the Myriad Scales Armor with his current cultivation.

One must know that Zhuge Qingyun was at the pinnacle of the Quasi-Saint, easily repelling five Quasi-Saints. Even if Zhuge Qingyun didn’t use any martial techniques, it was enough to tear Lin Yun into pieces, but the Myriad Scales Armor saved his life. This was the reason why defensive treasures were more expensive than offensive treasures.

Lin Yun suddenly threw another mouthful of blood out because of the saint aura that Zhuge Qingyun left within his body.

This is the power of someone at the Quasi-Saint? Lin Yun bitterly smiled because this price was greater than he had imagined. But he could do nothing about his current injuries, so anyone could easily take his head now. He had to force the scales out first, or he would die sooner or later because of his injuries. As long as he could remove the scales, his heart could pump normally, and his blood flow would return to normal.

Once the Blue Dragon Bone could be circulated, he would be able to recover from his injuries at a rapid speed.

“Is he dead?” Lin Yun raised his head to look at Zhuge Qingyun and lightly furrowed his brows. The latter was lying on the ocean with the Flower Burial Sword piercing his body. He wasn’t sure about the internal organs, but he was confident that Zhuge Qingyun’s heart was destroyed.

Even if Zhuge Qingyun were a Saint, he would be dead with his heart pierced without exception, and Lin Yun knew how terrifying the Flower Burial Sword was after the glory spirits were activated.

The heart was a person's greatest weakness, even if saint aura was special. But there was no exception that the heart was the greatest weakness of a Quasi-Saint. Then again, it was another question if they would die because of it.

It wasn’t because Lin Yun was looking down on his own strength, but the saint path was different from the mortal path. Even if he was strong at the Profound Life Stage, he was still considered a mortal, and he was unlikely to kill someone who had just stepped into the saint path.

Those at the Quasi-Saint could condense their saint aura. Strictly speaking, they already had one leg onto the saint path. It’s hard for those on the mortal path to injure those on the saint path, not to mention Zhuge Qingyun was at the pinnacle of the Quasi-Saint Realm.

As long as Zhuge Qingyun had enough opportunities, he could step into the Saint realm anytime he wanted. Even if he didn’t have enough opportunities, it wouldn’t be an issue for him to step into the Saint Realm within one or two years.

Lin Yun naturally wouldn’t think that he could face someone at the Quasi-Saint Realm, not to mention someone at the pinnacle of the Quasi-Saint Realm. He would probably be dead by now if he didn’t have the Myriad Scales Armor. He had risked his life during that earlier attack.

Seeing Zhuge Qingyun lying unmoving, Lin Yun’s eyes flickered and smiled. Tian Xuanzi would probably wear an interesting expression if he knew that his beloved disciple had died. But he wasn’t too confident about it and wanted to give Zhuge Qingyun another sword to ensure his death.

Bearing the pain, Lin Yun raised his hand, and the Flower Burial Sword flew from Zhuge Qignyun's body, returning to his hand. When the sword returned to his hand, Lin Yun threw out another mouthful of blood and collapsed again.

The surroundings were silent because everyone was shocked by what they had just witnessed. Although Zhuge Qingyun was careless because he didn’t even use his constellation or full strength, it still couldn’t conceal that Lin Yun’s sword had taken their breath. Not to mention that Lin Yun was only at the Profound Life Stage.

“How did he do that?” The Divine Phoenix Mountain’s Quasi-Saint was dumbfounded with disbelief that someone at the Profound Life Stage had killed someone at the pinnacle of the Quasi-Saint Realm.

Huang Xuanzi’s face was eerie, and he whispered to the Ming Cult’s Quasi-Saint, “That brat seems to be half-dead.”

The Ming Cult’s Quasi-Saint nodded his head. The other holy lands’ Quasi-Saints were heavily injured, and killing intent began to rise within his pupils after he came to his senses. He was too shocked earlier, so he failed to react immediately.

But before anyone could move, three figures descended from the sky. They were Gu Jun, An Liuyan, and Mei Zihua.

“Young Master, bear it. Let me help you up.” An Liuyan’s face changed when she looked at Lin Yun’s injuries, and her lips trembled. But she soon regained her composure because she knew she had to help Lin Yun.

“You’re really lucky.” Gu Jun breathed a sigh of relief but was inwardly deeply shocked. At the same time, he began to cautiously look around.

Lin Yun took a deep breath when he was helped back to his feet by An Liuyan. This naturally made An Liuyan’s face change, but Lin Yun comforted, “I’m fine. Help me up.”

“Okay.” An Liuyan tried her best to stop her hands from shaking.Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

A moment later, Lin Yun sat down and placed his sword beside him.

On the other hand, Gu Jun’s gaze was on Zhuge Qingyun, wanting to confirm if the latter was dead.

“Elder Gu, you can’t leave now.” An Liuyan said.

As Gu Jun fell into deep thoughts, An Liuyan sat down and placed her palms on Lin Yun’s back with her dragon origin pouring into Lin Yun’s body. “Young Master, let me help you treat your injuries.”

With An Liuyan’s help, Lin Yun managed to circulate the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron to force the dragon scales out of his body. Once the scales were forced out, he could easily recover from his injuries by relying on his physique.

“Make your move quickly, or there will be no chance once the other Quasi-Saints have recovered.” Huang Xuanyi urged, looking at Lin Yun recovering from his injuries.

The Ming Cult’s Quasi-Saint glanced at the five sects’ Quasi-Saints and swiftly made up his mind with a cold light flashing across his pupils. “Lin Xiao, time to pay with your life for killing the disciple of our Ming Cult!”

A roar exploded, shocking the other Quasi-Saints recovering from their injuries. They never expected that the Ming Cult’s Quasi-Saint would be so despicable as to take advantage of the situation now. Everyone knew that Lin Yun was half-dead at this moment.

“You’re courting death!” Gu Jun flew into a rage. But that wasn’t all; the Liu Saint Clan’s Quasi-Saint also took this advantage to dash over.

This forced Lin Yun with no choice but to face these enemies by himself, facing two Quasi-Saints. It didn’t take long for Gu Jun to fall into a disadvantageous position because he was proficient in music and not martial dao.

An Liuyan raised her head because Gu Jun was in a terrible state, and he was placing his life on the line to block the two Quasi-Saints. Thus, this naturally caused great exhaustion to his saint aura.

“Focus.” Lin Yun’s voice resounded, bringing An Liuyan’s attention back.
