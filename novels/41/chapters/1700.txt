Chapter 1701 – Shameless

Seven days have passed since he saw Yue Weiwei at the summit of the snowy mountain. Over the past seven days, the news of Lin Yun obtaining a quota without having to undergo the final test spread out, and it caused a massive commotion within the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion.

After all, Lin Yun teased the Saint Elder on his first day there before giving Jiang Yu a beating and crippled Jiang Feng. This piece of news shocked everyone, and no one could understand why. Various rumors began to spread, especially from the descendants of the Ancient Saint Clans. After all, they were prideful, and they even tried to display their talent before Mu Xueling, hoping that Mu Xueling could look at them in a new light and receive the qualification to be taught privately by her.

But they never expected that their schemes would go down the drain, and it was taken away by Lin Yun without them knowing it. Especially when there were rumors that Mu Xueling was giving personal guidance to Lin Yun. This nearly made them lose their composure.

Lin Yun naturally couldn’t be bothered by those rumors. Now that he had obtained the quota and didn’t have to worry about his identity being exposed, his days in the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion gradually relaxed. Aside from occasionally going to the summit of the snowy mountain and playing for Yue Weiwei, he had nothing better to do.

He would occasionally stroll around the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion and spend the night comprehending the sword technique that his master gave him. But he still hadn’t recovered his cultivation, so he couldn’t practice this sword technique.

The threshold of this sword technique was the Samsara Edict Realm, and Lin Yun was barely qualified to practice it because of his heaven-defying sword intent. He had only restored two of his dragon pulses so far, and he did not need to take the risk. But it was fine for him to comprehend it.

There was nothing else he could do about it, since he still had yet to restore his cultivation. But his mental energy and the Blue Dragon Skybreaking Art were rapidly improving.

With the help of the Profound Saint Pellets, his cultivation reached the pinnacle of sixth-grade Saint Spiritualist, and his mental energy was even stronger than the geniuses of the Ancient Saint Clans. But since he didn’t have any mental energy cultivation techniques, his foundation was slightly inferior to theirs. But with the Divine Phoenix Touch and Phoenix Heart Song, his trump cards far exceeded those geniuses.

The next few days were peaceful, and Lin Yun’s heart gradually calmed down under the gentle breeze. But he never forgot the true objective of coming here. He had to head to the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion and determine if it was the Azure Dragon’s lineage.

He didn’t hope to subdue them, but he would have more confidence to deal with Tian Xuanzi if he had their support. With the help of the Azure Dragon’s lineage, he could stand firmly in the Kunlun Realm.

But he was still worried about his injuries, since waiting wasn’t a solution. After all, cultivating was like rowing a boat upstream, and you’ll fall back if you stop moving forward. He couldn't spend his entire life on music dao, which was temporary. His primary reliance was his sword dao.

His cultivation was paused, but the geniuses of this era wouldn’t stop because of him. But he didn’t receive any information from An Liuyan, and he currently didn’t have a solution because the petals of the Heavenly Snow Lotus were no longer enough to treat his injuries.

Lin Yun sat down in a hall before a chessboard, playing with Gu Jun. During this period of interaction, Lin Yun resolved his conflict with Gu Jun. In reality, they didn’t have much conflict to begin with.

Gu Jun was well-informed and knew many things that other disciples didn’t. He knew Lin Yun was treated as a treasure by Mu Xueling and the pavilion master.

On the other hand, Lin Yun didn’t want to offend the other elders since he was staying in the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion, not to mention that he had offended Jiang Yu. Thus, they swiftly formed a familiar relationship with each other.

“You brat, why is your heart in a mess for the past few days? Don’t tell me that you’re running out of Profound Saint Pellets?” Gu Jun smiled.

“It’s more than enough to deal with you.” Lin Yun said in disdain.

“Haha.” Gu Jun smiled as he placed a chess piece down. He said, “You lost.”

“Ah?” Lin Yun glanced at the chessboard and saw Gu Jun slowly removing his white pieces. He didn’t even have to count to know he had lost entirely.

“Six of ten wins. Again!” Lin Yun said.

“You’re really shameless to say six of ten wins.” Gu Jun’s lips twitched when he heard what Lin Yun said.

Lin Yun’s attainment in music dao was terrifying, but he wasn’t talented when it came to chess. The two first played with Profound Saint Pellet as a bet. But Lin Yun gave up after losing three Profound Saint Pellets, changing the rules to two of three wins. Then, he changed to three of five and six of ten now.

“In terms of shamelessness, you’ve reached a whole new level. You look decent since even the Saint Elder places great importance on you, but why don’t you have any bottom line? You even want to bully an old man now?” Gu Jun laughed as he cleaned up the chessboard.

“Why don’t you say that to yourself? You’re over two hundred years old, and you even resorted to such means to con my Profound Saint Pellets.” Lin Yun rebuked.

Gu Jun’s face blushed, but he replied, “I’m doing this for your sake. You’re already using the Profound Saint Pellets in the Dragon Pulse Realm, so what will you use when you reach the Samsara Edict Realm? The Profound Saint Pellets are already high-grade saint pellets.”

“What grade is higher than saint pellets?” Lin Yun asked casually.

“Heavenly Pellets. But it’s hard for Heavenly Spiritualists to refine them, and they can only be refined by Divine Spiritualists. In the current Divine Dragon Era, Divine Spiritualists are even rarer than Emperor Realm experts. So I’m really doing this for your sake. It’s a waste for you to use Profound Saint Pellets now.” Gu Jun explained, and he routed back to the Profound Saint Pellets.

“I heard Saint Elder bestowed you quite a bit of Profound Saint Pellets.”

“What else did you hear?” Lin Yun asked.

“I even know a secret about you that the Heavenly Origin Mirror discovered…” Gu Jun squinted his eyes.

“Oh?” Lin Yun maintained a calm expression and asked, “How can you possibly know it? The likes of the Saint Elder should only know the information of that level, right? Are you boasting?”

“Ha, don’t try a psychological method on me.” Gu Jun smiled. “I’ve stayed in the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion longer than Saint Elder.”

“Why don’t you speak, then?”

“One Saint Pellet.” Gu Jun said.

“You’re really shameless.” Lin Yun’s face turned black, but he still handed a Profound Saint Pellet over.

Stowing the Profound Saint Pellet, Gu Jun smiled, “The Heavenly Origin Mirror discovered that you possess a Sovereign Constellation!”

Lin Yun was first alarmed before he breathed out a sigh of relief. It was fine if it was just the Sovereign Constellation.

“So you really do possess a Sovereign Constellation!” Gu Jun was stunned when he saw that Lin Yun didn’t deny that. The shock he felt was even more significant than Lin Yun's.

When Lin Yun glanced at Gu Jun's expression, he instantly knew that Gu Jun still wasn’t sure about that.

“Tell me. Which lineage are you from? There aren’t many Sovereign Constellation’s inheritances left.” Gu Jun smiled after he came to his senses.

“The Heavenly Origin Mirror can’t tell?” Lin Yun countered with a question.

“The Heavenly Origin Mirror can naturally see through all illusions. I’m only asking casually.” Gu Jun coughed and replied indifferently.

Seeing this, Lin Yun instantly knew that this old fellow was bullshitting. His Sovereign Constellation wasn’t fully formed yet, and it was natural that the Heavenly Origin Mirror couldn’t see through it. If this was the only secret that Mu Xueling grasped, he did not need to worry because this had no connection with his true identity as Lin Yun.

While they were casually chatting, a figure rushed over. This person was Luo Shuyi, and she had some anxiety on her face.

“Lady Luo, what’s the matter?” Lin Yun asked, seeing Luo Shuyi’s anxiousness.

“The Exquisite Court is here.” Luo Shuyi said, gasping for her breath.

Lin Yun was briefly alarmed and calmed down after listening to Luo Shuyi. The Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion wasn’t under attack, but the Exquisite Court’s disciples had come. This was normal because competition existed everywhere.

In the Ancient Barren Domain, the competition between sects’ disciples was often, and the outcome of their competition could affect the prestige of their sects. As one of the Four Musical Houses, it was normal for the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion to be challenged.

“The Four Musical Houses are the Flying Snow Pavilion, Seven Exquisite Palace, Myriad Flower Hall, and the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion… The Exquisite Court doesn’t seem to be one of the Four Musical Houses. The Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion can’t deal with the Exquisite Court?” Lin Yun asked. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Not since a long time ago.” Gu Jun smiled. “The Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion has been ranked at the bottom of the Nirvana Banquet the past few times, not to mention the Jiang Clan’s lineage in the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion. It has been a few hundred years since we had a Profound Fairy before Yue Weiwei came. The Four Musical Houses from back then were nothing but a showcase. Otherwise, why do you think the Divine Mountain would send Mu Xueling over?”

This was surprising, but it also made sense. After all, the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion was more unique than the other three musical houses. The Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion was a branch of the Heavenly Fragrance Sacred Ground in the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea.

Gu Jun continued secretly placing down a chess piece, “Oh, the Exquisite Court isn’t a pushover, and they’ve been eyeing the Four Musical Houses’ title for a long time. With the Nirvana Banquet imminent, they’re trying to cause trouble, which is an obvious scheme. If they win, the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion might lose the qualification to participate in the Nirvana Banquet.”

Glaring at him, Lin Yun had no idea what Gu Jun was rejoicing about from his tone.

“Saint Elder told me to inform you to deal with them. If they forced the Profound Fairy to come out to clean up the mess, then…”

“Then, what?”

“Saint Elder said that if the Profound Fairy is forced out, she’d make you spit out all the Profound Saint Pellets you consumed.” Luo Shuyi whispered.

The corner of Lin Yun’s lip twitched when he heard that. What did Mu Xueling mean by spitting out what he had already consumed them? He now knew that Mu Xueling was overprotective of this junior sister of hers.

“Young Master Lin, the Chief Disciple isn’t around, so we can only rely on you now.” Luo Shuyi said.

When Gu Jun placed a chess piece down, he said, “Go on. You’ve recently caused huge resentment in the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion, so this is an opportunity for you to prove yourself. Oh, and you lost this match as well.”

Lin Yun was speechless because he hadn’t even started. But he couldn’t be bothered with that and swiftly headed towards the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion with Luo Shuyi.
