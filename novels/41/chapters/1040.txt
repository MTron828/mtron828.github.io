Chapter 1041 - Trump Card

DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

The ancient tablet, demonic claw, and banner were powerful treasures. But only the ancient tablet gave Lin Yun the feeling that there was something more to it. He still remembered the powerful soul sealed in the tablet that forced him to retreat.

When Lin Yun tried to control the ancient tablet, he discovered a seal that was blocking his soul. Without the right method, he wouldn’t be able to control the tablet. It would also be difficult to take control over the tablet by force. When Lin Yun examined the ancient tablet once more, he got an eerie feeling that the tablet could devour souls.

“Perhaps this ancient tablet can devour souls and seal them…” Lin Yun muttered. If this was the case, it would explain why it had ancient souls inside of it. The extraction of souls might even be a secret that the Realm Son didn’t know about. After all, he had only used the souls in the tablet to fight.

Lin Yun put the tablet back into his interspatial pouch. It probably had a lot of secrets, so it would be useful for the future. As for the other treasures, Lin Yun glanced over them before Lil’ Red put them all away.

Lin Yun had obtained 50,000 Divine Astral Pellets, a bottle of Blood Flame Pellets, a drop of the Azure Dragon Saint Liquid, and the Nether Divinity Ancient Tablet. It was a huge harvest.

There were many geniuses gathered in Four Phase City and the underground market was busy. There were many people making transactions with the inheritances they obtained in the Heavenly Path.

The Sky Sword Intent, Azure Dragon True Bone, Divine Solar Lunar Fist, and Three Heavenly Divides were Lin Yun’s greatest trump cards. The Divine Shadow Fist and Indigoflame Thunderwhip were his secret weapons that allowed him to break through his limits. Lastly, he also had his martial souls, the Aurora Dragon, Flying Serpent, Qiongqi, and Kunpeng. These were his greatest secrets.

There was also the Firmament Battle Cloth that the Azure Dragon Lord gave him to deal with the old monsters. It was a supreme treasure with boundless power. If he brought it out, he could slaughter his way through the war realms. However, he couldn’t use it as he wished as it only activated in life and death situations. Not only did it have a great cost, it would attract the attention of the powerful sects.

For now, Lin Yun couldn’t trust the powerful sects, so he wouldn’t draw attention to the Firmament Battle Cloth. Using it could save his life, but it would also guarantee his death if the sects became interested in it.

“No wonder it’s something that I can only use when my life is in danger…” Lin Yun wore a grave expression. If he didn’t have the Firmament Battle Cloth, his trump cards wouldn’t be enough.

He had to make improvements in the Divine Solar Lunar Fist and Azure Dragon True Bone. He also needed to reach the fourth soul Heavenly Soul Realm in half a month. Lin Yun could feel a headache coming on because there was so much to do in so little time.

Initially, he had two months to prepare, but now he only had half a month. However, there was no way he could rush the holy spirit martial technique or tribulation. If he did, he could easily run into issues.

“Lin Yun, Luo Chen of the Azure Dragon Region requests a meeting!” A familiar voice came from outside that stunned Lin Yun. Lin Yun and Lil’ Red walked out to greet Luo Chen. Qin Lin and Jun Mengchen were with Luo Chen, which didn’t surprise Lin Yun.

“How did you guys find this place?” Lin Yun asked.

Luo Chen turned to look at Lin Yun. When he discovered that Lin Yun was calmer than he had expected, Luo Chen replied, “We’ve heard about Wind Mound City. Plus, it’s not so hard to find you, so we came here. We were worried about you.”

“Everyone thinks that I’m going to end up dead, so it’s rare that anyone would come to see me,” smiled Lin Yun.

“You saved us back in the Azure Dragon Palace and you even gave me the chief position of the Azure Dragon Region. No matter what, we had to come and help you,” said Luo Chen.

Lin Yun shook his head because he didn’t want to implicate them. After all, he also sent Pei Xue away.

“You misunderstood. We won’t go to Wind Mound City because we’ll end up being a burden to you. But let us know if there’s anything else that we can do to help. After all, the Realm Sons can’t do anything to us in this city,” smiled Qin Lin.

Luo Chen wore a grave expression and said, “Even if we do our best, there’s no way we can catch up to those people. To the Realm Sons, the Heavenly Path is a simple trial. But you’re not like us. We want you to survive this ordeal and reach Kunlun Realm.”

Lin Yun felt a surge of warmth in his heart when he heard that. The Heavenly Path was normally filled with treachery, so it was rare to have true friends.

“Thank you,” said Lin Yun. “I do need some help.”

“Speak,” replied Luo Chen.

“I need Blood Flame Pellets and True Dragon Saint Liquid. More is better.”

When Luo Chen’s group heard that, they sucked in a cold breath. Blood Flame Pellets were saint pellets used to strengthen one’s physique. Not many people were willing to sell them. Even if they were willing to sell it, a Blood Flame Pellet would cost at least 1,000,000 Astral Pellets. As for the True Dragon True Liquid, it was beyond rare. Even if there weren’t any on the market, they could only be bought by Divine Astral Pellets

Luo Chen tactfully explained everything to Lin Yun. But Lin Yun’s response baffled Luo Chen. “If it’s just because of the Divine Astral Pellets, then it shouldn’t be a problem.”

Lin Yun waved his hand and retrieved over 50,000 Divine Astral Pellets. Luo Chen’s group was dumbfounded by the amount of pellets.

After all, Astral Pellets and Divine Astral Pellets weren’t the same. The latter was simply too rare and could only be found with inheritances. Looking at the pile of Divine Astral Pellets, Luo Chen’s group became dizzy.

A long while later, Luo Chen finally recovered from his shock. “Brother Lin, you really trust us. Aren’t you afraid that we’ll take your Divine Astral Pellets and leave? After all, there’s nothing you can do to us in Four Phase City.”

“If that happens, then I’ve misjudged you guys,” smiled Lin Yun. Since they decided to help him out when no one else would, he would trust his instincts.

Jun Mengchen immediately spoke, “Rest assured, Brother Lin. We won’t take a single Divine Astral Pellet and we’ll get everything you need in three days.”

“With all these Divine Astral Pellets, you might be able to compete with the three Realm Sons,” said Qin Lin with his eyes glowing.

But Lin Yun didn’t say much when he heard that because most of the Divine Astral Pellets came from the twelve generals. Since the servants had all these Divine Astral Pellets, it made sense that the Realm Sons had even more. However, in Lin Yun’s eyes, he barely had enough to keep up with the Realm Sons.

His true power came from relying on the Azure Dragon True Bone, Divine Solar Lunar Fist, and Sky Sword Intent. As for the Divine Astral Pellets, he could only use them when undergoing his tribulation.

“I’ll have to trouble you guys for that,” said Lin Yun. With the three of them helping, he could save himself three whole days.

“I also need some information about the Realm Sons.” The Realm Sons were extremely mysterious, and Lin Yun needed as much information as he could get. After Luo Chen’s group left, he raised his head and stared at the sky.

For the next fifteen days, Lin Yun couldn’t afford to waste any time. No matter what, he had to save Yue Weiwei.

“I’ll start with the Divine Solar Lunar Fist.” Lin Yun took out a jade bottle. It had ten Blood Flame Pellets , which he directly poured into his mouth. As his vitality exploded, he felt every inch of his skin burning up.

A blazing leaked out of Lin Yun’s body as rings of fire surrounded him. When Lin Yun closed his eyes, he could sense the violent medicinal effect in his body. After opening his eyes, Lin Yun muttered, “The medicinal effect isn’t as strong as the Millennium Flame, but it should be enough.”

Lin Yun started to circulate the Divine Solar Lunar Fist after bringing out the full effects of the pellets. Shortly after, the Golden Crow and Silver Phoenix flew out of his body, as if they were the kings of the world.

They chased each other like real divine beasts. Every time Lin Yun saw them, he would feel shocked by how miraculous the holy spirit martial technique was. If he didn’t experience it himself, he wouldn’t believe that the holy spirit martial technique could give birth to spirits that were practically alive.

Even if the Realm Sons had their own holy spirit martial techniques, they probably wouldn’t be able to compete with the Divine Solar Lunar Fist. After all, Lin Yun had two holy spirits to deal with them.
