Chapter 562 - Start with a Success

Compared to Zhou Qin, Liu Yunyan attracted more attention as the spectators talked about how her father brought humiliation to the academy. Various names had fallen onto her father, such as arrogant, ignorant, and trash. So it was undoubted that she would become the center of attention two decades later.

There might be some distance between the stage and the spectators’ seats, but Liu Yunyan could hear what everyone said clearly. She had some changes on her face when she heard their words. Her expression was nervous and beads of sweat fell from her forehead.

Zhou Qin had keenly sensed this and he couldn’t help smiling. It was good news for him that his opponent’s mentality was affected before the battle. When the other disciples and elders of the Azurefoot Academy saw this scene, they also had smiles on their faces.

On the other hand, the Heavenly Province Academy’s party looked nervous. After all, every win was crucial. It would be a great help to the academy if Liu Yunyan could win.

“Big Sister Liu seems a little nervous. I’m not too optimistic about this battle,” said Mu Xue. She shook her head inwardly because she noticed that Liu Yunyan wasn’t in a good state.

“No. I believe in her,” said Lin Yun.

Mu Xue frowned her brows when she heard that because Lin Yun seemed to go the opposite of what she said. She didn’t believe that Liu Yunyan could defeat her opponent in this state.

“Let’s begin,” said the elder as he left the stage.

“I take sympathy for your father’s experience two decades ago, but I won’t go easy today,” smiled Zhou Qin as he purposely mentioned Liu Yunyan’s father to trigger her emotions even more.

“Come at me if you can,” said Liu Yunyan with a stiff expression. She drew her sword and pounced at Zhou Qin as a chilling ray emitted out from her sword.

Zhou Qin smiled as he released his origin energy that sounded like an ancient demonic beast’s roar. He threw a punch that rumbled like lightning and destroyed the sword aura coming at him.

“This sword technique has too many flaws.” Tang Yu shook his head when he saw this scene. It didn’t make sense for there to be so many flaws with Liu Yunyan’s strength. Zhou Qin seemed to have predicted this scene as he charged forward.

“Liu Yunyan, take my punch!” Zhou Qin stepped forward like a demonic beast as he threw a punch at Liu Yunyan’s sword.

Liu Yunyan’s sword began to tremble violently, which startled her and nearly caused her to lose her grip on her sword. This punch was too powerful, so she didn’t have the opportunity to display her strength.

“Let’s go again!” Zhou Qin laughed sinisterly as his body glowed green. As he roared, he dodged some of Liu Yunyan’s lethal strikes to approach her.

Lin Yun’s face changed when he saw this scene because things wouldn’t be optimistic if this continued. Zhou Qin had clearly used Liu Yunyan’s sore point against her. Otherwise, the victory would be uncertain if Liu Yunyan recovered her usual state. After all, there wasn’t a great difference between their strength.

Liu Yunyan had become haggard over the past month due to her determination. Lin Yun knew that she had been doing her best ever since the first time he saw her. So it wouldn’t be difficult for her to defeat her opponent if she could adjust her state.

Ten moves later, Zhou Qin threw out a punch that sent Liu Yunyan flying.

“She’s still too weak.”

“Does the Heavenly Province Academy have something loose in their minds?”

“She was defeated in just ten moves.” Lament sounded out in the surrounding area as many people shook their heads.

Liu Yunyan’s face was pale as she fell onto the ground with endless fear in her heart. Everything in her surroundings was dark and she couldn’t see anything. She could only hear voices and people shaking their heads. It was like knives stabbing into her heart, which made her face even paler.

She could imagine how disappointed the Heavenly Province Academy must be looking at her, including that person. That person had risked his life to bring her the Indigoflame Goldlotuses. Without him, she wouldn’t be standing here.

When Lin Yun’s figure appeared in her mind, determination filled Liu Yunyan’s eyes as she could see how the youth risked his life to bring her the Indigoflame Goldlotuses. She asked herself, Liu Yunyan, are you really this weak? You still can’t get over what happened two decades ago?

“The Heavenly Province Academy really made a mistake to send you out. You’re as weak as your father!” Zhou Qin sneered as he soared into the sky.

“I’m sorry, but the person going down is you.” Liu Yunyan’s eyes flickered with chill as she soared into the sky. The chilling wind around her made Zhou Qin shiver. Then, Liu Yunyan swung her sword out three times. Her sword blazed furiously, just like her fighting spirit.

Zhou Qin’s attack was destroyed before it could even get near Liu Yunyan. In just three swords, Liu Yunyan had easily dissolved Zhou Qin’s attack.

This surprised Zhou Qin and caused him to take several steps back. “You’re somewhat capable compared to your useless father. But this is still insufficient!”

Zhou Qin pounced forward once more as his aura increased. He left behind afterimages to move around quickly, but Liu Yunyan’s sword was even faster and she managed to stab him. Her sword was dazzling like a star as it hit Zhou Qin and sent him flying with a pained groan.

This scene left all the spectators shocked. But before Zhou Qin could land on the ground, Liu Yunyan’s sword rays shot out and enveloped Zhou Qin.

Zhou Qin’s face was dark and he could no longer smile anymore. He was having such great difficulty defending himself that he was even forced to take several steps back. “Damn it, you won’t beat me so easily!”

Zhou Qin roared and spiritual runes began to appear around him. They instantly intertwined into a spiritual diagram. Then, torrential flames poured out from the spiritual diagrams and gushed towards Liu Yunyan.

Within the flames, Zhou Qin began to throw a barrage of punches, each punch stronger than the last.

Liu Yunyan calmed down when she saw this scene. She knew that Zhou Qin would lose in terms of spiritual runes.

“This level of spiritual diagrams is nothing against me!” Liu Yunyan’s eyes flashed coldly as water attributed spiritual runes began to appear around her and formed an icy spear behind her. In the next second, the icy spear shot out and created a huge hole in the sea of flames.

The icy spear shot into Zhou Qin’s chest, pinning him to the ground. This made Zhou Qin throw up a mouthful of blood as his face turned pale. This time, he couldn’t get back up no matter how he tried.

This surprised many people because no one expected that Liu Yunyan would win so easily after she calmed her emotions. When the Azurefoot Academy saw this scene, their faces became grim. The pressure was no on them since they lost the first battle. If they lost the next fight, they would be out of the competition.

“I admit defeat!” Zhou Qin yelled as he watched Liu Yunyan approach him.

Liu Yunyan waved her hand and dismissed the ice spear. Looking at Zhou Qin, she said coldly, “Get lost.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Zhou Qin’s face was ugly as he struggled to get back up on his feet. He swiftly returned to his team.

“We won!” Mo Ling had joy in her eyes. Everyone from the Heavenly Province Academy also had joy on their faces, except for Mu Xue who wore an awkward expression.
