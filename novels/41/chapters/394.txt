Chapter 395 - Undercurrent

“Lord Guardian!” Luo Feng was shocked when he heard that. He initially thought that there might be a chance when he saw Guardian Plum nearly killing Bai Ting. He even thought that Lin Yun wouldn’t be too heavily punished.

But he was dumbfounded when he heard that Guardian Plum was going to cripple one of Lin Yun’s profound veins. How could one of his profound veins be crippled? The pain from that and the drop in cultivation was a heavy blow to any cultivator.

“Luo Feng, do you have anything to say?” asked Guardian Plum in a solemn voice.

“Guardian Plum, you can’t cripple his profound vein. His cultivation came from risking his life in the Demonlotus Realm, which wasn’t easy for him. The Demonlotus Realm only opens once every two decades. How many two decades can there be in one lifetime? How is he going to bring back his cultivation if you cripple it?” Luo Feng instantly panicked. “Lin Yun made great contributions to the sect. He rang the Phoenix Plum by killing Mo Luo, he suppressed everyone at the Princess’ Banquet, and he ascended to the tenth level of the Black Lotus Palace. Isn’t that enough? He even contributed all his harvest from the Black Lotus Palace to the sect. The items have just been sent to the Contribution Hall, so how can we cripple one of his profound veins now?”

“So you’re saying that I have to reward him for killing nine people and disregarding the sect’s rules?” questioned Guardian Plum.

Luo Feng was emotional and his entire body was trembling. He spoke out in a sobbing voice, “The sect’s rules are ironclad… You also said that ten years ago and we were forced to witness Big Brother Ye’s entire family break up. Big Brother Ye saved your life! Would you even have your current position if it wasn’t for Big Brother Ye? I couldn’t accept it when you said that it was the sect’s ironclad rules. Lord Guardian, Xin Jue is already dead and Xin Yan is still unconscious. Why must we cripple Lin Yun’s profound vein?”

Luo Feng’s words stunned Guardian Plum and he couldn’t help feeling a pain in his heart when Luo Feng mentioned this matter.

Taking advantage of this opportunity, Luo Feng looked at Guardian Plum and he continued to persuade him, “If the sect’s rules can’t protect those loyal to us, then why should we need it in the first place? Guardian Plum, please take back your decree!”

Lin Yun’s eyes were closed as tears rolled down his cheeks. He initially thought that his tear glands had dried up, but he couldn’t hold his tears back today.

“Lord Guardian, please don’t cripple Senior Brother Lin’s profound vein. It doesn’t matter even if Wang Yan is killed. He’s arrogant and all he does is bully his fellow disciples.” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“The Gentlemen Union is a tumor in our sect and they should have been dealt with a long time ago. I support Senior Brother Lin’s decision today!”

“I might not have interacted with Senior Brother Lin, but I’ve never heard any rumors about him bullying fellow disciples.”

Luo Feng’s words made all the disciples speak up for Lin Yun. They were disciples, so they knew how difficult it was to cultivate in the Profound Martial Realm. Crippling a profound vein was a disastrous blow to a cultivator. If Lin Yun’s willpower wasn’t strong enough, then his path as a cultivator would end here.

Guardian Plum was shocked when he saw so many disciples kneeling on the ground. He had never seen such a shocking scene in the sect, which placed him in a difficult position.

But right at this moment, Lin Yun who had his eyes closed suddenly threw up a mouthful of blood. This made his already paled face even whiter. At the same time, Lin Yun’s aura dropped. He had crippled one of his own profound veins!

This scene had left everyone shocked. Even Guardian Plum’s face had changed drastically.

“Lin Yun!” Luo Feng was the first who dashed over as he cried, “Why did you do that?! You’re always like this…”

Lin Yun squeezed out a smile and comforted, “Elder Luo, don’t make things difficult for Guardian Plum. Perhaps the decision might not be his. Furthermore, it’s already a huge grace that the sect is sparing me from death.”

He then turned to the surrounding disciples and he cupped his hands together, “I have never met many of you before, but I’m grateful that all of you have spoken up for me. With all of you here, the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s prestige will never fall.”

“Junior Brother Lin…” The surrounding disciples were shocked as they looked at each other. The outcome was something that no one had expected.

Guardian Plum sighed. He walked over to Lin Yun and gave three pats on the shoulder. Each pat on the shoulder sent an enormous amount of origin energy into Lin Yun’s body to heal his injuries. After three pats, the pain Lin Yun was bearing disappeared.

“You’re not allowed to bring your sword or your interspatial pouch to the Repent Cliff. If you trust me, you can hand it over to me,” said Guardian Plum.

Lin Yun nodded his head and took off his sword box. Ever since he gained his sword, he had never parted ways with it. Images suddenly flashed in his mind, images of when he was still a sword slave. He had gone through life and death with this sword and he had never parted with it.

Handing over the sword box to Guardian Plum, Lin Yun also took out his interspatial pouch and handed it over. There were many treasures in the interspatial pouch, but Guardian Plum was someone that he trusted.

“Let’s go.” Guardian Plum personally led the way to the Repent Cliff.

Everyone else was down as they looked at the youthful figure slowly disappearing from their sights. Lin Yun might have left, but he left a permanent image in everyone’s heart. He had too many things that were worthy of others to recall.

When the sun slowly set, Qin Yu and his group headed to the capital. Along the way, the other members of the Azure Association would exclaim at what they saw today. These were experts in either the tenth stage of the Profound Martial Realm or quasi-Violet Palace Realm. Their fame in the empire was merely second to the eight titles. But even they couldn’t help but be filled with admiration for what they witnessed Lin Yun do. None of them could cripple their own profound vein if they were in Lin Yun’s position.

On the other hand, Qin Yu was in a good mood because Lin Yun was no longer a threat since he had crippled his profound vein. Even if he managed to make another breakthrough in his cultivation, it wouldn’t be happening anytime soon. This meant that Lin Yun wouldn’t be in the Dragon Gate Competition at the end of this year.

Furthermore, a living Lin Yun had a higher worth compared to a dead Lin Yun. When the group looked at the mountain, a cloud of dust suddenly rose from up ahead. A group of people were heading in their direction.

This left everyone shocked because they couldn’t imagine anyone so bold to block Qin Yu’s path. Were they tired of living?

“Your Highness, why don’t I go and take a look?” The Heavenly Profound Sect’s Han Lan locked his brows together.

Qin Yu smiled, “No worries. Back down. They’re just a bunch of garbage.”

“But…” pleaded Han Lan.

“Back down,” smiled Qin Yu.

No one dared to say another word because the crown prince would never repeat his words a third time. If he did, then the consequences were something that no one could be imagined. He had already repeated himself twice, so no one dared to stand out for the third time.

The guards and Azure Association’s members around Qin Yu retreated and left him alone. After the dust dissipated, the group of cultivators were revealed. They were from the Great Qin Empire’s Wang Clan, led by the current patriarch, Wang Tian!

When he looked at Qin Yu who stood alone, Wang Tian’s face was dark and filled with killing intent.

“You Highness, I have to admit that you have courage. You’re not afraid that I’ll kill you out of rage?” Wang Tian gnashed his teeth while suppressing the rage in his heart.

“The one who killed Wang Yan is Lin Yun. I’m afraid that you got the wrong person,” smiled Qin Yu.

“Lin Yun did kill Wang Yan, but you’re the one who told him to stay in the Sword Firmament Pavilion!” Wang Tian barked as he pointed at Qin Yu.

“If it wasn’t for your words, Wang Yan would be safe and sound in the Wang Clan’s Manor. I have to give it to your brilliant plan. The Wang Clan just sold our lives for you, but you sold Wang Yan out in the blink of an eye.”

“Really? That makes me even more curious. What did I get your Wang Clan to do?” asked Qin Yu.

“Is there a meaning in pretending to be dumb? If it wasn’t for your instructions, why would my Wang Clan take the risk and ambush a core disciple from the Sword Firmament Pavilion!”

“My instructions? Who did I give my instructions to?” Qin Yu tugged his hands together as he looked at Wang Tian.

“You told Wang Yan…” Wang Tian’s face suddenly changed. Wang Yan was already dead, and there were no witnesses to this claim. When he raised his head, he saw Qin Yu folding his arms looking over with a playful gaze.

“Patriarch Wang, why aren’t you continuing? Your story is pretty interesting and I still haven’t had enough of it,” smiled Qin Yu.

“I’ll kill you!” Wang Tian lost his temper and charged at Qin Yu.
