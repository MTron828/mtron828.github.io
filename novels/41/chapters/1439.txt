Chapter 1440 - Shaking the Sword Sect

Eight thousand meters deep in the Saint Pool, there were three figures wrapped in golden light that made them stand out at the bottom of the pool.

Seated before a massive black vortex, golden astral saint energy that was like silk was pouring into Lin Yun’s body. Lin Yun had been in the Saint Pool for the past three days. Over this period of time, the surrounding water pressure gradually increased, as if it was a huge hand squeezing down on him, bringing a huge burden to his physique.

Compared to him, Lil’ Purple and Lil’ Red had it easier. Lil Purple was a phoenix, while Lil’ Red was a demonic beast. So they were akin to fishes in a pool. But that was only temporarily. The pressure within the Saint Pool was increasing as time passed.

A thousand meters deep into the Saint Pool was still alright, but the pressure was a little terrifying at eight thousand meters, especially in the spot that Lin Yun chose. It was close to the vortex, but Lin Yun had no choice but to take a risk. The water pressure here was terrifying, but this also meant that the benefits were higher.

Lin Yun could even sense that his Innate Azure Dragon Saint Physique was being baptized and tempered. It first started with his internal organs, then to his limbs, flesh, bones, and dragon runes. In just three days, the number of his dragon runes had reached four thousand. He felt that if he stayed there longer, he could increase the dragon runes to five thousand!

But it was the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron that changed the most. As boundless astral saint energy poured into his body, golden scriptures began to appear on the surface of the cauldron. Whenever a word appeared, the cauldron would emit a strange sound as a heavenly dragon and divine phoenix could be faintly seen.

Lin Yun didn’t recognize the scriptures, but he could sense the power contained within them. He could also sense that as the scriptures increased, the cauldron also slowly increased in weight. The destructive sword aura emitted from the cauldron also became even more terrifying, and Lin Yun could sense that it wasn’t something he could control at his current level. So he didn’t dare to be reckless and could only try to slowly control it in the future.

Just by absorbing the astral saint energy, Lin Yun could sense a terrifying ominous aura being emitted from the cauldron, turning his eyes bloodshot. But Lin Yun also noticed that the cauldron was no longer as frightening as it devoured astral saint energy.

So… it’ll behave as long as there’s something to eat? Lin Yun inwardly murmured. The cauldron felt like a pet and a troublesome one at that. As for those scriptures, Lin Yun wasn’t that curious because he couldn’t understand any of them. He felt those scriptures had a huge background, but it wasn’t something he could think about right now.

Five days passed in the blink of an eye and a person flew out of the Saint Pool, emitting a dazzling sword ray. This instantly attracted the attention of all the Divine Firmament Peak disciples seated along Saint Pool Square.

Since this place was a popular cultivating spot, everyone could cultivate here as long as they had time. So there were still many disciples around even after five days.

“Who came out?”

“It should be Lin Yun. His cultivation is lower than Senior Brother Chen, so he won’t be able to last long.”

“It’s hard to say. Look, he’s here!” A person soared out of the abyss just when everyone was softly discussing their opinions. When they saw the person hovering in the air, they realized that this person was emitting a powerful aura that was at the three-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm.

“So strong!”

“Reaching the three-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm in five days. The effects of the baptism are really great!”

“After Senior Brother Chen refines all the astral saint energy, he might even be able to reach the top ten on the Earth Ranking…” Everyone’s eyes were filled with envy as they looked at Chen Ling.

Five days ago, Chen Ling was still stuck in the bottleneck of two-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm with no signs of making a breakthrough anytime soon. But five days later, he reached three-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm and might even be able to reach four-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm in the future. This meant that his path in the Dragon Pulse Realm would be smoother, and he had a high chance of reaching the second stage of the Dragon Pulse Realm before the age of thirty-five!

“Disciple Chen Ling greets the peak master and Senior Brother!” Chen Ling bowed as he came before Mu Chuan with excitement written on his face.

“You’re a direct disciple of the Divine Firmament Peak starting today. You can pick a ghost spirit martial technique. Remember to go into seclusion to digest this opportunity well.” Mu Chuan nodded with a smile.

“I…” Chen Ling briefly hesitated before he continued, “I wish to wait for Junior Brother Lin and go together with him.”

Mu Chuan was surprised when he heard that, but he inwardly nodded. He replied, “That works as well. It shouldn’t take long for him to come out.”

“This…” Chen Ling looked awkward.

“What’s the matter?” Mu Chuan furrowed his brow.

“This disciple never saw Junior Brother Lin in the Saint Pool. Before I came out, I initially planned to greet Junior Brother Lin. But I couldn’t see him even after going five thousand meters down. I only faintly saw a figure dive into the vortex before I came out.” Chen Ling cupped his hands.

Chen Ling’s words immediately caused an uproar. Lin Yun entered the vortex? Isn’t it the same as courting death? Even disciples in the first stage of Dragon Pulse Realm might not be able to withstand the vortex. Is he insane?!

“Are you serious?” Mu Chuan quickly asked.

“I’m not too sure about it. Five thousand meters is my limit, and I was forced to come out before I could take a better look.” Chen Ling replied. He saw a massive vortex behind Lin Yun, which even stirred the astral saint energy that had condensed into golden sand at the bottom of the Saint Pool. He was sure Lin Yun had entered the vortex, but he didn’t dare say it.

The astral saint energy was invisible, but the accumulation over the years transformed it, turning the astral saint energy into astral saint dust. Aside from that, he also saw two other figures devouring quite a lot of golden sand near Lin Yun.

The golden sand was the accumulation of the Divine Firmament Peak over the past millennials. Although the peak master said that they were free to empty the Saint Pool if they had the ability, Lin Yun even stirred the astral saint dust. So the peak master would probably feel heartache if he knew that.

“Hahaha! He really gave me a surprise!” Mu Chuan was briefly shocked before he rejoiced. He smiled, “He really gave me a surprise. The vortex might be dangerous, but the benefits are also unimaginable. The Divine Firmament Peak picked a treasure this time! Hahaha!”

Chen Ling smiled and didn’t dare to say a word. Thanks to Lin Yun, he could receive the baptism, so he naturally wouldn’t rat Lin Yun out. But if Lin Yun took it too far, it was just a matter of time for the peak master to discover it.

“Go back and rest. You two can go to the Martial Arts Hall when that brat returns.” Mu Chuan waved his hand with a smile.

“Peak Master, you’re not worried about Junior Brother Lin’s safety?” Feng Luan asked in a surprised tone.

“Don’t worry about it. He must've come up with a way since he only entered the vortex after five days. He’s not stupid to court death. Just wait. He’ll shock the entire Sword Sect this time.” Mu Chuan smiled.

Feng Luan fell into deep thoughts when he looked at the Saint Pool covered in a fog. For some reason, he had a feeling that somewhere wasn’t right.

The entire Saint Pool Square burst into an uproar upon hearing that Lin Yun had entered the vortex. Everyone became excited because they knew Lin Yun would receive great benefits if he survived within the vortex. Just like that, exclamations would burst out from Saint Pool Square every day Lin Yun stayed in the Saint Pool.

Half a month had passed in the blink of an eye, shaking the entire Sword Sect. Even disciples from the Scarlet Firmament Peak, Golden Firmament Peak, Azure Firmament Peak, and Indigo Firmament Peak had disciples coming over because it was too unbelievable that Lin Yun actually stayed at the bottom of the Saint Pool for half a month, still showing no signs of coming out. This made people wonder if Lin Yun had died instead.

That was a little scary, but it was highly possible. But they calmed down upon seeing Mu Chuan’s face. If anything really happened to Lin Yun, there was no way the peak master would be so calm. Just like that, another ten days passed, and even Mu Chuan couldn’t maintain his composure anymore because Lin Yun had stayed in the Saint Pool for twenty-five days!

With his cultivation, Mu Chuan could sense that Lin Yun was in no danger. Not only was he in no danger, but his vitality was also massive, like a sun.

On the twenty-seventh day that Lin Yun stayed in the Saint Pool, the entire Sword Sect burst into an uproar as famous figures began appearing. In the beginning, only those on the Earth Ranking came. But gradually, the top ten on the Earth Ranking were practically there, and even peak masters were coming over with the surroundings slowly losing control.

On the twenty-ninth day, a boundless sword aura that looked like a golden sun arrived above everyone’s heads. It was a golden sun containing terrifying sword intent before a grey-clothed old man walked out of it, giving off a majestic prestige. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“We greet the sect master!” This personage was Mu Xuankong, the sect master of the Sword Sect. All the disciples cupped their hands together upon seeing this person.

M Xuankong wore a solemn expression as he immediately appeared beside Mu Chuan. He furrowed his brows and asked, “What’s going on?”

“I really have no idea. I can only be sure that he’s still alive, and his vitality is blazing like a fire.” Mu Chuan said with a slightly guilty conscience. He was a little flustered upon seeing the sect master’s gaze.

“It has almost been a month. Just how long is he going to stay in there?” Mu Xuankong murmured as he fell into deep thoughts. That was also the question in everyone’s mind as they looked at the abyss where the waterfalls converged, their brows furrowed, and shock reflected in their pupils.

If Lin Yun came out now, how strong would he become? It was unprecedented in the history of the Sword Sect for someone to manage to stay in it for so long that they couldn't make an estimation.

“That brat won’t discover the secrets of the astral saint dust, right…?” Mu Xuankong suddenly said, instantly making the faces of all peak masters weird.

When he heard that, Mu Chuan’s face changed, and he smiled, “I don’t think so. It doesn’t matter even if he finds out; how much can he take anyways? Perhaps he’s struggling in the vortex and couldn’t reach the bottom.”

“It doesn’t matter. This is a matter of your Divine Firmament Peak, and it’s all on you if he crosses the bottom line.” Mu Xuankong indifferently replied.

But Mu Chuan’s face turned dark as he inwardly cursed when he heard that. But he couldn’t say a word with the other peak masters watching with playful looks. The astral saint dust was the accumulation of hundreds or thousands of years.

Some disciples could move the golden dust at the bottom of the Saint Pool, but that was the limit to what they could do. None of them could absorb too much, and there hadn’t been a precedent. After all, who would’ve thought that someone could stay in the Saint Pool for nearly a month and still show no signs of coming out?
