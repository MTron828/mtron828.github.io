Chapter 1326 - Appearance of the Great Saint Origin!

Mu Qingqing and Luo Shuyi were both peerless beauties. So their appearances made the Silversnow Valley even more packed with beauties, including Su Ziyao and Ye Ziling.

“Congratulations, Big Sister Ye.” Mu Qingqing greeted Ye Ziling with joy flickering in her pupils, and she was happy for Ye Ziling from the bottom of her heart. Then, she turned to look at Luo Shuyi and smiled, “Thank you for coming as well, Big Sister Luo…”

“I didn’t do much to help. I was stopped by Xuan Ying. It’s all Flower Burial’s effort.” Luo Shuyi replied.

After a while, Ye Ziling finally knew what kind of commotion her origin saint rune caused. She was especially shocked when she heard that eight Greater Elysium Core Realm experts died in the hands of Lin Yun. Lin Yun might look like he did nothing, but he had done a lot.

Suddenly, black and white pillars of light soared into the sky, causing the entire Silversnow Mountain Range to tremble violently. At the same time, the surrounding celestial aura began to decrease at a rapid speed.

When the black and white beams of light reached the sky, they were like ink that fused together and formed into an ancient seal in the sky. At the same time, Lin Yun could sense that the Profound Wither Key in his interspatial pouch began to lightly tremble before it settled down soon after.

“What’s going on?” Everyone on the Profound Wither Island could clearly sense the huge commotion. When the black and white pillars of light successfully fused together, light began to gather in the sky, which made it look like a starry sky.

“It’s the Great Saint Origin. It was in the sky, no wonder it’s so hard to find.” Lil’ Purple muttered from the sword box.

“The Great Saint Origin?”

“What pagoda is that? Don’t tell me that the Great Saint Origin is in the pagoda!”

“Who knows, there might even be other treasures. That pagoda alone doesn’t look ordinary…” Everyone near the Silversnow Mountain Range began to boil with excitement. Even Mu Qingqing and the other geniuses close to the valley were shocked. The Great Saint Origin had finally appeared.

Raising his head, Lin Yun had to admit that the phenomenon in the sky was pretty huge. There was an ancient pagoda hovering overhead, and the top layer was shining brightly.

“The Great Saint Origin has finally appeared!” Mu Qingqing said emotionally. There was no question that no matter how many treasures were there on the Profound Wither Island, all of it added together couldn’t even be compared to the Great Saint Origin.

Even the Saint Origin of an ordinary saint would cause a huge commotion when it appears and would cause countless people to fight over it, not to mention the Saint Origin of the Profound Wither Great Saint. The Profound Wither Great Saint was the heir of the Southern Emperor, and he was a legend by himself.

“I have to take my leave now and gather up with the others from my sect. So I’ll have to take a step first.” Luo Shuyi smiled. As the fated transcendent of the Heavenly Note Sect, she naturally had to compete for the Great Saint Origin now that it has appeared.

“If we end up fighting, later on, I’ll have to ask Young Master Lin to go easy on us.” Luo Shuyi smiled when she looked at Lin Yun.

“Haha. It’s still unclear who has to go easy on who,” smiled Lin Yun. After obtaining the firmament sword intent, Lin Yun’s sword intent had reached a terrifying height, and it could act as an alarm that further boosted his senses.

He could sense something terrifying from Luo Shuyi, and this meant that she definitely wasn’t as simple as she looked right now.

Luo Shuyi smiled before she left with the other disciples of the Heavenly Note Sect. They were graceful, and when they left, they gently played their instruments as a form of farewell.

“Alright, you can stop looking now. She’s already gone.” Su Ziyao’s voice resounded.

Wearing an awkward smile, Lin Yun swiftly retracted his gaze. It’s not that he wanted to look at her for so long, he just couldn’t control his gaze.

“Young Master Lin, are you also competing for the Great Saint Origin?” Mu Qingqing asked.

Hearing that, Lin Yun nodded his head. There was no question that he would compete for the Great Saint Origin.

Receiving Lin Yun’s acknowledgment, Mu Qingqing locked her brows together and muttered, “It’s troublesome now.”

Lin Yun was briefly stunned when she mentioned that it had become troublesome, but he soon figured it out. After all, the Sword Sect would definitely fully support Sikong Zhou to compete for the Great Saint Origin. So if Lin Yun was also going to compete for it, then they would have to fight sooner or later.

This was naturally something that Mu Qingqing couldn’t accept. After all, the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect and Sword Sect belonged to the same faction. Their opponents were already strong enough, and if they fought, it would greatly decrease their chances at the Great Saint Origin. But she was smart and soon figured out a solution, “Young Master Lin, are you willing to listen to my suggestion?”

“Go on,” smiled Lin Yun. He wanted to see how she would deal with this troublesome situation. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“When competing for the Great Saint Origin, we will all rely on our own ability. But if any one of us obtains the Great Saint Origin, then the other party has to help to the best of their ability,” smiled Mu Qingqing. “What do you think of this? After all, the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect and Sword Sect are one family, to begin with. So it’s the same regardless if you or Senior Brother Sikong obtained it.”

“Fine with me,” replied Lin Yun. If he couldn’t obtain the Great Saint Origin with his own ability, then there was naturally nothing he could complain about it since it meant that he was weak. So he naturally wouldn’t mind helping Sikong Zhou to the best of his ability. Then again, that was under the condition that Sikong Zhou was stronger than him.

“That’s a promise, then!” Mu Qingqing was happy because the strength of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect couldn’t be underestimated. With their help, this meant that they would have a higher chance at obtaining the Great Saint Origin.

Then again, the Profound Sky Sect still had a huge advantage over the powerful sects. They had three fated transcendents, and just Lei Jue and Xuan Ying were strong enough; not to mention Qin Cang, who was even stronger. He still hadn’t shown up, and this meant that the origin saint rune he was refining definitely reached an unimaginable height.

After bidding farewell to Mu Qingqing, the group briefly rested before they headed to where the Great Saint Origin was located. The interspatial pouches left by the eight Greater Elysium Core Realms didn’t have any value, and even if Lin Yun forgot about their interspatial pouches, Lil’ Red wouldn’t. Right now, Lil’ Red was already an expert at cleaning up the battlefield.

As Jiang Lichen and the rest helped clean out the battlefield, they found several saint elixirs from those big sects’ elders, and those were unexpected surprises. But thinking about it again, that wasn’t much. The eight of them were at the top of the pyramid in the Profound Wither Island, so they naturally wouldn’t hold back in harvesting all the treasures. Aside from fated transcendents, they didn’t have to fear anyone.

But all of their harvests benefitted Lin Yun’s group. Just when they were checking their harvests, the entire Profound Wither Island was enveloped in a storm.

In an ancient cave, a youth opened his eyes and walked out of the cave, “The Great Saint Origin has finally appeared.”

He was donned in a saint armor, emitting a purple glow and even emitted an extraordinary aura. Shortly after, he let out a roar before he flew in the direction of the Great Saint Origin. He was the fated transcendent of the Emerald Jade Manor, and his appearance was instantly recognized by those outside the Profound Wither Island.

“Did anyone notice what he has obtained? It seems to be an ancient armor!”

“Don’t tell me that the origin saint rune he had refined came from that armor?”

“This is an impressive harvest. Not only did he obtain an origin saint rune, but he also obtained some ancient armor. With that armor, who can injure him in the Profound Wither Island?”

.

“He’s practically invincible!” The big sect’s elders were shocked because the harvest obtained by the fated transcendents had far exceeded their imaginations.

Within a thundercloud, Dugu Yan suddenly opened his eyes with a light flickering in his pupils. In his sight, azure thunder flames blazed violently. When Dugu Yan released a roar, he made all of the thunderclouds tremble as he emitted a boundless sword aura. His eyes were emitting a terrifying light, making him even more terrifying.

When those outside the Profound Wither Island saw this scene, they were deeply shocked. After all, Dugu Yan was said to be invincible in the sword, and he could be comparable to fated transcendents. But now, they finally believed in the rumors.

“Looks like he has refined that Azure Thunder Sacred Flame.”

“The Azure Thunder Sword Eyes are really terrifying. It’s no wonder why he had his eyes closed most of the time.”

“Looks like Flower Burial is in trouble…” Their words raised a commotion and many people found it a pity that the Great Saint Origin had appeared too early. If Lin Yun managed to reach the Elysium Core Realm and refined an origin saint rune, no one on the Profound Wither Island would be able to compete with him.

Although he managed to kill eight Greater Elysium Core Realm experts, he was still weaker than those fated transcendents. Fated transcendents were invincible, to begin with. Now that they had an origin saint rune engraved on their elysium core, this had widened the gap between them and Lin Yun.

This wasn’t considering the mixture between their combinations and opportunities on the Profound Wither Island. Even Dugu Yan had already become so strong, so there was naturally nothing to say about the other fated transcendents.

“Mhm? Qin Cang is out of his seclusion!” The surrounding commotions suddenly stopped, and all of their gazes were directed over.

Outside the Profound Wither Island, everyone was feeling uneasy because the Demonflame Lotus that Qin Cang had refined not only contained an origin saint rune, but also a true dragon’s blood. The process of refining it definitely wasn’t easy. But if he succeeded, they couldn’t imagine how strong Qin Cang would become. Aside from the Profound Sky Sect, the elders from the other powerful sects were feeling nervous.
