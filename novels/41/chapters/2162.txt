Chapter 2163: Heavenly Dragon Bone

“That fellow really can’t wait!”

“The battle had just ended, so he must be a little anxious to ask the Saint Elder to declare the result.”

“That’s the Heavenly Dragon Lord’s title, it’s both the champion and first place of the Blue Dragon Record. Who wouldn’t be anxious?”

“Honestly speaking, I still can’t figure out how Ye Qingtian won in the end.”

“Perhaps it has something to do with that legendary sword technique of Ye Qingtian’s. Ye Qingtian has a sword technique called the Light of the Beginning. Not only did it come in contact with space dao, but it even touched time dao…” A discussion broke out on Dragon Mountain after hearing what Lin Yun said, but they still hadn’t come to their senses from the previous battle.

Saint Elder looked at Lin Yun from above. Her gaze might seem cold, but she was inwardly happy. Lin Yun might not seem to be reliable, but he had become the Champion of the Blue Dragon Record. If Yue Weiwei knew about this, she would probably be happy about it.

But when Mu Xueling thought of Yue Weiwei, she felt a little melancholy, and she couldn’t help looking at Lin Yun hatefully.

“Saint Elder, do you have anything else?” The official from the Divine Dragon Empire beside Mu Xueling blinked her eyes and asked in a slightly anxious tone. The Blood Moon Sect and Demonspirit Clan might’ve backed down for the time being, but she still couldn’t help feeling a little afraid. So she wanted to end the Blue Dragon Record quickly in case there was any trouble again. If someone from the Blood Moon Sect and Demonspirit Clan really became a dragon lord, the Empress would probably lose it.

Although Ye Qingtian might not have a good reputation, he was at least a prodigy swordsman of the Heavenly Dao Sect. No matter what, they wouldn’t become enemies with the Divine Dragon Empire. So it was acceptable for the Divine Dragon Empire to have Ye Qingtian become the Heavenly Dragon Lord.

To the Divine Dragon Empire, the other geniuses on the Dragon Mountain were worthwhile to recruit, not only the dragon lords. They were geniuses, and the Divine Dragon Empire could also recruit the forces behind them onto the Divine Dragon Empire’s side, allowing the Divine Dragon Empire’s strength and prestige to reach a new height.

The Blue Dragon Record was a treasure, but it was a pity that it wasn’t under the control of the Divine Dragon Empire. There were still other uses for the Blue Dragon Record, so it was a huge pity that it couldn’t be used by them.

Mu Xueling said, “If no one has any objections, the Heavenly Dragon Lord’s title will belong to Heavenly Dao Sect’s Ye Qingtian. If anyone is dissatisfied with this result, you can wait till Ye Qingtian recovers before challenging him!”

Many people were tempted when they heard the first half of Mu Xueling’s words. After all, anyone could tell that Ye Qingtian was injured, and it would take some time for him to recover. So they might have a chance if they fought him now.

But after hearing the second half of Mu Xueling’s words, everyone fell silent. After witnessing the fight between Ye Qingtian and Gu Xiyan, no one wanted to fight Ye Qingtian when he was in his top form.

“Since there are no objections, the Blue Dragon Record will come to an end here, and I will be issuing the rewards. Divine Dragon Aura!” Mu Xueling held onto the Blue Dragon Record and injected her saint aura into it. When the Blue Dragon Record began to shine brightly, a tremendous event began to take place on the Dragon Mountain.

Regardless of those on the Dragon’s Tail, Dragon’s Torso, or the Dragon’s Claw, dragon aura began gushing out from underground. They were all basking in the dragon aura, emitting a radiance, and they could sense some transformation happening to their physiques.

.

Everyone could refine the ancient divine dragon aura, but the amount and quality would be different. On the thrones on the Dragon’s Heads, they enjoyed the richest dragon aura, and everyone could even see a dragon coiling around them. They all had excitement on their faces, and they had clearly benefited greatly while absorbing the dragon aura.

On the broken Heavenly Dragon Stage, Lin Yun was baffled because there was also dragon aura here, but the dragon aura was pale in comparison to the other dragon lords. Not only could they absorb and refine the dragon aura, but they would also have a corresponding dragon soul to aid them in cultivation. The Blue Dragon beside Gu Xiyan was the strongest and most ancient.

But where was his Heavenly Dragon? Just when Lin Yun was feeling uneasy, the shattered Heavenly Dragon Stage came back together. As runes began to appear on the stage, the runes fused together, forming into a dragon. This was the Heavenly Dragon’s soul that came from that droplet of Heavenly Dragon’s blood.

The Heavenly Dragon gave off a powerful and noble aura. But it was weak while looking at Lin Yun as though it was apologizing. When Lin Yun looked at the Heavenly Dragon, he felt heartache for some reason. He roughly knew why he couldn’t obtain the heavenly dragon aura. This was because the Heavenly Dragon’s soul was too weak.

The Heavenly Dragon Lord’s title wasn’t planned, to begin with. There were initially only nine dragon lords, so there wasn’t any heavenly dragon aura or heavenly dragon’s soul.

Lin Yun suddenly began to feel guilty because this was only a remnant soul of the Heavenly Dragon, and he still wanted too much. With a smile, he said, “You can go back.”

He wanted the Heavenly Dragon to go back to the Blue Dragon Record to rest. But the Heavenly Dragon didn’t go back and coiled around him before breathing out its aura. This strand of dragon aura was long and continuous, containing unimaginable power that covered the entire stage in a solemn and sacred aura.

But before Lin Yun could respond, the heavenly dragon aura entered his body and coursed through his limbs. His injuries were recovering rapidly, and he even gave off a faint golden luster with boundless vitality surging through him.

“That feels great!” It was an indescribable sense of comfort. Not only did he recover from all of his injuries, but his cultivation also increased. It further surprised him when the strand of heavenly dragon aura began to accumulate within his violet palace after coursing through his body.

In the end, it formed into a golden bead within the violet palace with silver runes engraved on the surface. When Lin Yun tried to probe it with his sword intent, his sword intent was rebounded back.

“What the hell is this?” Lin Yun was shocked because this small bead actually repelled his pinnacle Astral Sword Intent the moment they came in contact. This made him wonder about the origin of this bead because this was a little too terrifying.

When Lin Yun opened his eyes, the Heavenly Dragon became dimmer after breathing out the heavenly dragon aura and returned to the Blue Dragon Record. Raising his head, his gaze bumped into Mu Xueling’s gaze.

“That’s the Dragon Origin, and it’s not any different from the other Dragon Origins. The only difference is that this is the Heavenly Dragon’s Dragon Origin.” Mu Xueling transmitted her voice to Lin Yun, explaining to him.

This made Lin Yun fall into deep thought. He planned to look into it when he got back to see how special this Heavenly Dragon’s Dragon Origin was.

“What a powerful dragon aura! The dragon aura is different from the dragon aura you can find in the outside world. Even my physique has been tempered by it.” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“My saint physique seems to have become much stronger than before!”

“But there’s too little of it. Just look at the dragon aura that the dragon lords are enjoying, how envious. They even have a dragon’s soul tempering their physique.”

“Having their souls tempered by a dragon’s soul, they will also be able to withstand the corruption of demonic influence, and it will benefit them greatly when forming the saint soul.”

“How envious. It will be a lot easier for them to step into the Heavenly Origin Phase in the future, and this puts a gap between us.”

“The breakthrough to the Heavenly Origin Phase is dangerous, and it’s on a whole other level than the Indigo Origin Phase. But they will undergo a drastic transformation after undergoing the baptism of the dragon’s soul.”

“Those on the Dragon’s Claw have also received the baptism of the dragon’s soul, it’s just that they didn’t have a dragon’s soul to themselves.” Those outside the Dragon Mountain began to discuss amongst themselves. Everyone on the Dragon Mountain received a great benefit, but those who were ranked at the front received an even greater benefit.

“What a powerful dragon aura. The excess dragon aura is stored in my blood and marrow. My future cultivation will be a lot easier,” Ji Zixi exclaimed. She would occasionally look at the Heavenly Dragon Stage, before she said, “Ye Qingtian didn’t seem to have received much dragon aura.”

Bai Shuying said, “The Heavenly Dragon Stage is too special, and the Blue Dragon Record might not have any heavenly dragon aura.”

“That’s highly possible,” Xin Yan frowned. If that were the case, it would be too unfair to Lin Yun. Not only them, but many people have been paying attention to the Heavenly Dragon Stage. They began to discuss amongst themselves, and they wore weird expressions, not knowing that Lin Yun had already possessed the Heavenly Dragon’s Dragon Origin.

If that was really the case, the Heavenly Dragon Lord only had a higher title, and the benefits were even less than the other dragon lords. That was what everyone was thinking. When the divine dragon aura was more or less refined, Mu Xueling began to distribute the second reward.

“Those on the Dragon’s Tail will receive ten Dragon Blood Pellets, those on the Dragon’s Torso will receive a droplet of the True Dragon’s blood aside from ten Dragon Blood Pellets! Those on the Dragon’s Claw will receive a True Dragon Bone aside from the previously mentioned rewards!” A commotion rang out from the surrounding area as everyone became emotional.

After all, the Dragon Blood Pellets, True Dragon’s blood, and True Dragon Bone would greatly boost everyone’s strength. Those who could be on the Blue Dragon Record were geniuses or chief disciples of a sect, and they didn’t have any lack of resources to cultivate. But dragon’s blood and dragon bones cannot be purchased even if you have money.

As everyone became excited, Mu Xueling looked at the nine dragon lords, and she said, “The nine dragon lords will receive a hundred Dragon Blood Pellets, a droplet of Divine Dragon’s blood, and you can receive a dragon bone that corresponds to your title.”

The Dragon Mountain burst into an uproar as everyone enviously looked at the nine dragon lords, especially the divine dragon lords. They would receive a dragon bone corresponding to their title, and this meant that divine dragon lords would receive a Divine Dragon Bone.

“The Blue Dragon Bone.” Gu Xiyan took a deep breath as he looked at the box before him. He then opened it to reveal the Blue Dragon Bone within. He couldn’t contain his emotions because the other rewards were nothing compared to the Blue Dragon Bone, and he needed it greatly. This was because he was from one of the lesser realms, and his foundation would always be a tad lacking when compared to geniuses in the Kunlun Realm.

The Blue Dragon Bone could make up for that difference. With the Blue Dragon Bone, it would be easier for him to practice the Heavenly Dao Fist, strengthening his fate. Furthermore, he could also use it to exchange for a Qilin Saint Bone in the future.

Thinking about this, Gu Xiyan couldn’t help looking at Ye Qingtian. The latter might never look serious, but he was surprised when Ye Qingtian sent him to the Blue Dragon Throne even after his defeat. This meant that Gu Xiyan owed Ye Qingtian a favor.

Gu Xiyan had an upright figure, and this could be seen from how he admired Flower Burial. They never met before, but he admired Flower Burial so much that he stood out to protect the latter’s reputation. Most importantly, the favor that he owed to Ye Qingtian was a huge one.

But Gu Xiyan began to think about Ye Qingtian’s rewards. He suddenly realized something and wondered if Mu Xueling would give Ye Qingtian a Heavenly Dragon Bone. But how was that possible? After all, the Heavenly Dragon’s blood was unexpectedly obtained, so it was impossible for Mu Xueling to possess a Heavenly Dragon Bone.
