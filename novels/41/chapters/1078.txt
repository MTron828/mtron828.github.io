Chapter 1079 - Revealing Trump Cards!

“HEAVEN! AND! EARTH! UNITE!” Lin Yun roared as he charged towards the Imperial Feather Realm Son. A terrifying aura enveloped the surrounding space as the sun became dark. At this moment, the only source of light was Lin Yun’s Golden Crow and Silver Phoenix.

Boundless energy poured into Lin Yun’s body as he emitted a dazzling radiance. Then, with his hair fluttering wildly in the wind, a chaotic aura started to grow in his palm. As the energy throbbed, the entire heaven and earth began to tremble violently.

The Imperial Feather Realm Son locked his brows together because Lin Yun had an advantage by cultivating two holy spirits at the same time. In truth, he also cultivated more than one holy spirit martial technique, but not two at the same time. Dual holy spirits meant that the holy spirit martial technique required two holy spirits for its foundation.

A technique of this level required high talent and boundless vitality. It was difficult for even transcendent talent to cultivate such a difficult technique. However, there was also a flaw to such a technique. The vitality exhausted to cultivate two holy spirits at the same time was immense. The exhaustion was so great that Lin Yun might only be able to execute his attack once. As for the Imperial Feather Realm Son, he would be able to execute his attack multiple times.

Facing Lin Yun’s attack, the Imperial Feather Realm Son wore a grave expression. Then, he executed his holy spirit martial technique once more. Along with a series of explosions, countless meteorites began to shatter and fine cracks appeared on the Imperial Feather Realm Son’s holy spirit.

The Imperial Feather Realm Son could sense that his holy spirit was slowly breaking apart. So when his holy spirit collapsed, Lin Yun’s punch hit his fist.

With a huge explosion, the Imperial Feather Realm Son was sent flying backwards. Blood dripped out of his mouth as his face turned ugly. The power of Lin Yun’s attack far exceeded his imagination. He almost couldn’t believe that his Heavenly Meteorite Fist was destroyed.

If it wasn’t for the divine rune in his heart, Lin Yun’s attack might’ve taken his life. Now that his holy spirit was destroyed, the Imperial Feather Realm Son’s aura was overwhelmed by Lin Yun. So he tried his best to compensate with punches containing his third-grade martial intent.

When facing these attacks, Lin Yun calmly fended them off. Then, he approached the Imperial Feather Realm Son. He knew that the Imperial Feather Realm Son had other holy spirits, and he had no intention of allowing the Imperial Feather Realm Son to unleash them. Just like that, the two of them had exchanged dozens of attacks. The Imperial Feather Realm Son was clearly in a disadvantageous position and the light of his divine rune had dimmed down on his chest.

The Imperial Feather Realm Son knew that he couldn’t allow this to drag on or else he would die. Gathering his flame intent, the Imperial Feather Realm Son tried to get away from Lin Yun.

“Come back!” Lin Yun roared as the Golden Crow and Silver Phoenix formed a vortex. In the beginning, the vortex was only ten meters longer, but it grew to a few hundred meters in the blink of an eye. Lin Yun was pulling the escaping Imperial Feather Realm Son over to him.

“Die!” Lin Yun controlled his two holy spirits while his Azure Dragon Sword Aura enveloped his hand like a dragon claw. If the Imperial Feather Realm Son was hit, Lin Yun would rip his heart out.

Everyone who saw this scene had shock written on their faces. They could tell that Lin Yun wanted to get revenge by digging out the Imperial Feather Realm Son’s heart.

“Great!” If the crowd could see this, the Imperial Feather Realm Son definitely knew it too. However, he charged at Lin Yun instead of retreating. With boundless flames blazing on the surface of his body, Lin Yun emitted a golden brilliance that turned into a dragon.

“Break!” Lin Yun released his sky sword intent as 18 dragon runes gathered on his arm. Then, he collided with the Imperial Feather Realm Son who was sent flying. Although Lin Yun made him bleed even more, he failed to get the Imperial Feather Realm Son’s heart.

The fight shocked the crowd because the Imperial Feather Realm Son was withstanding Lin Yun’s attack even without his holy spirit. He must have exhausted countless resources to have such a sturdy foundation.

If it was someone else, they wouldn’t have been able to withstand Lin Yun's attack after losing their holy spirit. However, Lin Yun didn’t stop his attack and threw another nine punches.

Although the Imperial Feather Realm Son managed to withstand the first eight punches, the last punch sent him flying. The radiance of the divine rune on his chest had dimmed down quite a lot. It was worrisome because the Imperial Feather Realm Son merely relied on the rebound force of the divine rune to defeat the Royal Wind Realm Son.

So without the divine rune, he would lose a means of protection. However, the divine rune didn’t even seem effective against Lin Yun. When the Imperial Feather Realm Son picked himself off the ground, he wiped the blood off his lips. “I never would have imagined that you would make a breakthrough after losing the Azure Dragon True Bone. Who would have thought that someone with weaker cultivation could force me this far.”

“Cripple yourself and I’ll spare your life,” said Lin Yun.

“Hahaha!” The Imperial Feather Realm Son laughed. “You’re really arrogant, but our futures aren’t the same. I’ll rise quickly upon reaching Kunlun Realm, but you will amount to nothing!”

“Flame Dragon’s Heart!” The Imperial Feather Realm Son roared and the divine rune on his chest shattered, emitting strands of golden flames that turned into a roaring dragon. Lin Yun’s heart began to rumble violently like thunder after lightning.

At the same time, the Imperial Feather Realm Son’s heart began to emit ancient dragon energy. His blood was dyed gold as scales appeared on the surface of his body. It looked like he was an actual flame dragon!

His heartbeat alone caused many people to bleed from their seven orifices. Very quickly, the bleeding people fell to the ground.

“A dragon’s heart! The Imperial Feather Realm Son actually has a flame dragon’s heart with a divine rune embedded on it!” At this moment, the elders in the starry sky were shocked.

“He actually has a Flame Dragon’s Heart!”

“No wonder he dares to say that he’ll rise in Kunlun Realm. With the Flame Dragon’s Heart and a divine rune, he’ll become an unrivaled genius when he grows up!”

“Well, it’s hard to predict. After all, there are many geniuses in Kunlun Realm. Becoming unrivaled isn’t an easy task. But as long as he doesn’t die, he’l definitely be a king within 100 years!”

“With the Flame Dragon’s Heart, it won’t be that easy for Lin Yun anymore!”

The elders were initially worried if Lin Yun would slay another Realm Son. But looking at the current situation, they didn’t have to worry about the Imperial Feather Realm Son anymore. Some of the elders frowned because Lin Yun’s talent had caught their attention. But if Lin Yun didn’t learn how to give up, there was a high chance that he would die.

The Imperial Feather Realm Son snorted as he relied on the aura of the Flame Dragon’s heart to unleash an entirely new holy spirit. It was a gigantic dragon enveloped in flames that reached the same level as Lin Yun’s dual holy spirits.

With the third-grade flame intent, Flame Dragon’s Heart, and flame dragon holy spirit combined together, the Imperial Feather Realm Son’s aura had reached a terrifying height. With fire shooting out of his eyes, he yelled, “Dawn Breaking Dragon Pupils!”

In response, Lin Yun circulated the Golden Crow Nine Transformation and a pair of wings appeared behind him.

With pride in his pupils, the Imperial Feather Realm Son asked, “Do you understand why I wanted your Azure Dragon True Bone? The Azure Dragon True Bone isn’t a treasure that someone like you can possess. After all, you can’t unleash its full power. No one can survive after I bring out the Flame Dragon’s Heart. Lin Yun, stop struggling. Become my servant and I’ll bring you to Kunlun Realm with me! I’ll even grant you boundless glory!”

“You’re thinking too much about it. I’ll be taking your Flame Dragon’s Heart!” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly as his sword intent reached its peak. Right at this moment, a sword hum resonated in the sky, instantly suppressing the heartbeat of the Flame Dragon’s Heart.

In the next second, everyone’s swords soared into the sky as unimaginable sword intent manifested comets that flew across the Saint Spiritual Lake. Right at this moment, Lin Yun had pushed his sky sword intent to complete mastery!
