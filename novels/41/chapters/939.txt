Chapter 940 - Scouting for Information

He never expected that his fourth Primordial Chaotic Soul would be the legendary Kunpeng. He had already awakened the Aurora Dragon, Qiongqi, and Flying Serpent. Logically speaking, the Primordial Chaotic Souls were one more terrifying than the other which had far exceeded his imagination.

It was impressive for ordinary geniuses if they could awaken a Primordial Chaotic Soul. But Lin Yun had awakened them in a series that had started to terrify him because it had made him feel uneasy.

What made him even more terrified was that the Primordial Chaotic Souls seemed to be the subordinates of that ‘broken sword’. This gave Lin Yun a strong premonition that the Primordial Chaotic Souls weren’t his genuine martial soul but that ‘broken sword’ in the mysterious space.

When the brilliance shone out, Lin Yun also managed to see that the ‘broken sword’ had been drawn out by one-fourth. The entire sword was black with mysterious runes engraved on it that gave off a feeling as if those runes could destroy the world.

He could sense an immense pressure coming from the swords as though his soul would be sucked in with just a glance. This also gave him a feeling that he wanted to bow before this sword and the emergence of this sword would be accompanied by a shocking tribulation.

Lin Yun had speculated in his heart that the eight Primordial Chaotic Souls were the souls of the sword. This meant that someone had once killed those mythical beasts before using their blood essence and soul to refine this sword.

“If this sword is my martial soul, that explains my shocking talent in the sword path.” Lin Yun held onto his chin with his eyes shining brightly. Heavenly Soul Realm experts could be found everywhere in the Heavenly Path, but they were all killed and Lin Yun didn’t have to use his martial soul.

The martial soul corresponded with the fate soul among the three immortal souls and seven mortal souls. A person also had the heavenly and earth souls, but they weren’t in the body. Only the fate soul was in the body. This meant that if the martial soul shattered, that person would lose one soul and would be no different from a zombie.

So no one would bring their martial souls unless they were in a desperate strait and wanted to take a bet. He heard that martial souls also had another usage after reaching the empyrean realm and could exist in another form.

A long time later, Lin Yun recollected himself and calmed his thoughts down. The more he thought about it, the more exciting Kunlun Realm seemed to be. After all, even empyreans couldn’t be considered powerhouses in Kunlun Realm. So he knew that he had to grasp the time to find more opportunities. After all, he would be no different from an ant if he was still at the bottom of the pyramid even after reaching Kunlun Realm.

So this meant that he needed to find harvest in the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm or even find some powerful inheritances. He had to grow stronger in the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm if he wanted to help Yue Weiwei. He didn’t want to stand by the side and watch Yue Weiwei being bullied.

There was without a question that Lin Yun had grown a lot stronger with his sword intent making a breakthrough to the sky sword intent. If he ran into that mysterious lady again, he was confident of facing her even without relying on Lil’ Red and the Indigoflame Thunderwhip. But it would be a different story if he wanted to win.

After all, she was in the fourth soul Heavenly Soul Realm and Lin Yun hadn’t seen her full strength. So this meant that he needed to temper his strength more. He planned to cultivate the Divine Glorysun Fist and allow his Divine Sunbreaking Seal to refine a fire-attributed monarch beast core.

With the sky sword intent, he should have some odds of defeating a monarch demonic beast in the third soul Heavenly Soul Realm. But there were still dangers because most monarch demonic beasts had a powerful bloodline and couldn’t be considered an ordinary genius in the third soul Heavenly Soul Realm.

But first, he had to find out where he could find a monarch demonic beast. With that, he quickly left this place and headed deeper into the forbidden region. The forbidden region was the core of the Azure Dragon Region, and the dangers in it far exceeded the seven astral lands.

Whenever night came, the entire place would become a paradise for demonic beasts. So there was no way one could travel by himself without sufficient strength. Lin Yun was still fine because he didn’t even have to move his fingers with Lil’ Red dealing most of the troubles on his behalf.

When he ran into troublesome demonic beasts, he would directly just slay them with his sword. So this meant that many demonic beasts were killed by Lin Yun and Lil’ Red. As for their beast cores, they naturally went to Lil’ Red.

Lil’ Red had also undergone a transformation. After reaching the first soul Heavenly Soul Realm with the cultivation technique given by Yue Weiwei, it had grown a lot stronger. In terms of strength, even third soul Heavenly Soul Realm geniuses might not be able to capture it.

If it used the Void Blade or Blood Viperwhip, Lil’ Red would be a lot stronger. If Lin Yun gave the Indigoflame Thunderwhip to Lil’ Red, even he would have to be fearful of Lil’ Red. After all, Lil’ Red had too much vitality which was a lot stronger than used by Lin Yun.

In the blink of an eye, three days had passed and Lin Yun didn’t see any cities along the way. This made Lin Yun helpless because he knew that he needed to find gatherings with human cultivators to find information about monarch demonic beasts. Then again, it would also be troublesome if he went in because practically everyone in the Azure Dragon Region knew about him.

He still had an ongoing grudge with Bloodbone Realm and they would definitely come after him. Aside from that, who knew how many people wanted the Glorysun Spirit and dao artifacts on him. So he knew that he would cause a huge ripple if he showed up somewhere.

They couldn’t be considered trouble because Lin Yun didn’t want to reveal his tracks before the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm appeared. When the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm appears, it would definitely attract all the geniuses in the Azure Dragon Region or geniuses from other regions. So there was no harm for him to maintain a low profile.

“Let’s go. The nearest city is two days away.” Lin Yun looked at the map before continuing the journey.RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Two days later, Lin Yun stood on a hill with the majestic outline of a city at the far end. When it appeared before Lin Yun’s sight, this was a pretty considerable city. It was ten times bigger than the Flamecloud City he was in a few days ago.

With the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm imminent, all the cultivators from the various realms began to search this core region frantically. There were many realms gathered in this city, so it shouldn’t be tough for him to find information about monarch demonic beasts.

The only trouble would be how he should enter the city. If he wore a mask, the sword box he was carrying would surely still attract many people’s attention. Just when he was in deep thoughts, two figures walked past under the slope. This was one of the main paths towards the city, so it wasn’t surprising to see anyone passing here.

Looking at the two figures, Lin Yun was briefly stunned before he smiled, “What a coincidence.”

Those two were Xian Yunzhen and Chen Qiong, the first two higher realms’ geniuses that Lin Yun had blackmailed in the Flamefeather City. They were initially a laughingstock, but no one soon laughed at them. After all, even someone like Feng Wuji was slain along with Kong Xuan on the forty-seventh on the Azure Dragon Ranking.

So everyone soon forgot about Xian Yunzhen and Chen Qiong. They were also those who had rushed over to watch Lin Yun’s battle with Kong Xuan back then. When they watched the fight among the crowd, they were both completely dumbfounded.

They initially thought that Lin Yun would die at the hands of Kong Xuan. But they never imagined that Lin Yun would rise. Back then, they could still barely fight with Lin Yun. Now, they couldn’t even look at the back of Lin Yun’s figure. They would lament every time they thought about it and felt that the Hidden Treasure Pavilion was the opportunity for Lin Yun to rise.

“All because of that cat!” Chen Qiong gritted his teeth. “It didn’t even leave anything behind for us. If it did leave something for us, we wouldn’t be in this state.”

Thinking about the past, Xian Yunzhen had pity written on his face, “If only we were more decisive back then, the opportunities in the Hidden Treasure Pavilion would all be ours. At that time, our name will be the ones to spread in the Azure Dragon Region and not Lin Yun.”

Then again, the Millennium Flame and divine astral pellets were the main reason why Lin Yun’s strength could grow so swiftly. But they had also thought too much about it. Even if they did have some harvest in the Hidden Treasure Pavilion, they would still be defeated by Lin Yun after they came out. At that time, their harvest would still go to Lin Yun. So there was nothing to feel pity about simply because they weren’t strong enough.

“It has been a long time.” A familiar voice sounded out just when Chen Qiong and Xian Yunzhen were chatting among themselves. This caused Xian Yunzhen and Chen Qiong to be briefly stunned. When they raised their heads, they saw Lin Yun standing on a tree without them knowing.

“Lin Yun!” Chen Qiong and Xian Yunzhen were both startled when they saw Lin Yun. Clearly, they never expected that they would run into Lin Yun here.

“Come with me. This isn’t the right place to speak.” But Lin Yun didn’t bother about the two of them and headed deeper into the forest. Chen Qiong and Xian Yunzhen’s faces started changing and began to hesitate.

“What’s that fellow trying to do?”

“Let’s go and take a look. If he wanted to kill us, we would’ve already been dead by now.” The two shivered whenever they thought about Lin Yun’s strength. After all, their current wealth wasn't even possible for Lin Yun to blackmail. So they only hesitated briefly before they followed behind Lin Yun.

After Xian Yunzhen and Chen Qiong followed up, Lin Yun directly told them about his request about them to find information about monarch demonic beasts.

“You’re not stupid after all. Many people will definitely have their ideas placed on you with the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm emerging,” said Xian Yunzhen.

“And also information about the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm along with the Azure Dragon Ranking.” Lin Yun held onto his chin and realized that he was pretty lacking in information.

Chen Qiong’s eyes flickered and probed, “What benefits do we have in this matter?”

He had mustered his courage in saying that because he knew that Lin Yun could easily kill them if they weren’t happy. When he saw Lin Yun falling into silence with a smile, this instantly made them nervous. But Lin Yun knew that this matter was more or less done since they asked him for repayments. Furthermore, he knew that these two wouldn’t dare to reveal his tracks based on their expression.

“Ten divine astral pellets,” said Lin Yun. This had also indirectly guaranteed that there were divine astral pellets in the Hidden Treasure Pavilion which left them shocked.

Very quickly, they had joy reflected on their faces because this was a great deal. After all, it was ten divine astral pellets for some valueless information and said, “Deal!”
