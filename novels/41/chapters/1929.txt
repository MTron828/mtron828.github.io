Chapter 1930 - Low Profile! (2)

The Saint Elders on the altar wore smiles as they introduced their juniors and disciples to the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint. Everyone had roughly gotten some information, so they were so attentive in promoting their juniors and disciples. Only the Dragon Origin Great Saint maintained his silence and said nothing.

The other candidates with ‘0’ on their medals had someone promoting them to the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint.

“Dragon Origin Great Saint, why aren’t you saying anything?” The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint turned to look at the Dragon Origin Great Saint. “Ye Qingtian is also one of the ten candidates, right?”

The Dragon Origin Great Saint was inwardly alarmed and said, “Heavenly Jade Sword Saint must be joking. Ye Qingtian is only lucky and inferior in terms of cultivation and foundation. His cultivation came from refining half a Saint Origin, and he’s only lucky to make it so far. He definitely won’t be able to make it into the top ten, and his talent in the sword is ordinary.”

“Oh?” The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said, “I heard that he has grasped six sword forms of the Divine Firefly Sword, and they are also saying that he’ll definitely become a Sword Saint in the future.”

“Becoming a Sword Saint is difficult, and he needs experience. Not to mention he hasn’t changed even after returning to the Heavenly Dao Sect. He’s still as cocky as before,” the Dragon Origin Great Saint said with a cold expression. “He won’t be able to become a Sword Saint with his character, and he might change to cultivate the Dracophant Saint Purgatory Art like me. He needs to change his personality, or he might commit a mistake again in the future.”

The Dragon Origin Great Saint maintained a low profile and even spoke badly about Ye Qingtian. Naturally, this surprised everyone; they had no idea what the Dragon Origin Great Saint was trying to do.

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint no longer said anything after hearing what the Dragon Origin Great Saint said.

But the Dragon Origin Great Saint couldn’t help feeling anxious upon seeing that the battle was about to begin, and he inwardly hoped that Ye Qingtian wouldn’t shine too brightly later. It would be good enough if he could barely make it into the top ten, and it was best for him not to get into the top ten. Anyhow, he could give Ye Qingtian some rewards himself.

He was afraid Ye Qingtian might catch the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint’s attention and be snatched away. He couldn’t refuse if that happened because Ye Qingtian and the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint practiced the sword. He also became speechless at how fast Ye Qingtian became so popular in just a few days.Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

When Lin Yun went up on the tenth stage, he waited for his challenger. He was the first to go on the stage and had to undergo several battles until he lost. He had to defeat the nine challengers and make it into the top ten.

“Qi Yu of the Upper Nine Peaks!” A blue-clothed youth went on the stage and cupped his hands together.

Qi Yu was also a swordsman, with his cultivation reaching the third transformation of the Nirvana Stage, and he was in his fifties. He had become famous long ago; however, there were too many geniuses within the Heavenly Dao Sect for him to shine. But he was pretty famous outside the Heavenly Dao Sect.

“Indigo Thunder Peak, Ye Qingtian.” Lin Yun returned a greeting.

“My sword dao talent is inferior to you, but you have low odds of winning against me with your current cultivation. You’re destined to become one of the most outstanding geniuses in the history of the Heavenly Dao Sect, and there aren’t many who can be compared to you. If I can defeat you, I should be able to catch some attention,” Qi Yu said.

He highly evaluated Ye Qingtian and knew he would be surpassed by Ye Qingtian sooner or later. But he was confident that he could defeat the current Ye Qingtian because of the difference in their cultivation. Qi Yu could also be considered a monster amongst geniuses with his aptitude.

“I don’t know if you’re praising or looking down on me with your words. Let’s stop wasting time and make your move,” Lin Yun smiled.

Qi Yu immediately summoned his constellation, a ferocious Fire Spirit. This was an anxious ominous spirit with shackles tangling around its arms with a horn on its forehead. This was Qi Yu’s constellation, and he had been tempering his constellation for the past decade. This was why the aura his constellation gave off was stronger than geniuses in the same generation.

Even the constellation of geniuses at the ninth transformation of the Nirvana Stage wouldn’t be stronger than him, and he immediately caused an uproar when he summoned his constellation. Everyone knew that no one would hold back in the finals anymore.

But facing Qi Yu, Lin Yun had no intentions of summoning his constellation.

“Mhm?” Qi Yu furrowed his brows with puzzlement in his pupils.

No one would continue to hold back after coming this far because the victory would be determined in one or two moves. So Lin Yun not summoning his constellation was no different from courting death in his eyes.

“I don’t need to bring out my constellation to deal with you,” Lin Yun said indifferently.

Hearing what Lin Yun said, Qi Yu smiled, “You have quite the character, but I like it. I only had 70% odds of winning earlier, but I have 100% now! Hahaha!

“Blazing Incineration Star!” Qi Yu drew his sword and executed a high-grade ghost spirit martial technique with his constellation, unleashing a roar. Under the empowerment of his constellation, his sword aura became increasingly terrifying and formed into a powerful sword aura. A dazzling sword ray enveloped the area as nine flaming vortexes tore through the sky and headed towards Lin Yun.

On the other hand, Lin Yun drew the Flower Burial Sword and poured his dragon origin into it before swinging it, cutting apart a flaming vortex. But that wasn’t all, Lin Yun shook his wrist and unleashed several sword rays, destroying the remaining vortexes.

At the same time, Lin Yun disappeared and reappeared before Qi Yu. When their swords clashed, neither of them had any intention of retreating. They both felt that they could win. One was confident in his sword dao, while the other was confident in his cultivation and constellation.

In the blink of an eye, they exchanged over seventy-two strikes and nearly tore apart the entire stage. Lin Yun strolled casually, but Qi Yu was covered in injuries with fine cracks appearing on his constellation, and the power of his constellation had declined.

After another clash, both Lin Yun and Qi Yu retreated. Qi Yu was covered in seventy-two wounds, with sword rays seeping out of his wounds and blood splashing around. His face also became terrifyingly pale, and he fell onto one knee.

“Seventy-two swords, and I actually failed even to block one of them. I have underestimated your attainment in sword dao.” Qi Yu was unwilling to admit defeat but still cupped his hands together before going down the stage. He looked disappointed, unlike when he went on the stage.

Everyone else was also shocked. It wasn’t shocking that Ye Qingtian could defeat Qi Yu, but they couldn’t believe that Ye Qingtian defeated Qi Yu without even bringing out his constellation. Qi Yu couldn’t block any of the seventy-two swords, and the difference was a little significant between them. Just how heaven-defying Ye Qingtian’s attainment in sword dao had to be?

“He improved again in three days.” Wang Muyan squinted her pupils, looking at Lin Yun. Lin Yun had improved too quickly when it had only been three days.

Ye Feifan and Zhang Yue exchanged a glance, their faces becoming ugly. They couldn’t comprehend this situation as well.

“Ye Qingtian’s sword intent seems to have improved, giving a feeling that it has become complete. His sword intent gives me a feeling like lifting something heavy lightly…” A Saint Elder sighed on the Heavenly Dao Altar.

“He now has a grandmaster’s demeanor.”

“A young grandmaster?”

“Hard to say. He doesn’t seem like a brat in his twenties…” The Saint elders were shocked, and only the Dragon Origin Great Saint’s face was ugly because he had speculation.

Lin Yun must have visited the Celestial Purging Mountain; he might have even seen that person.

“Dragon Origin Great Saint, this is what you said: Ye Qingtian only made it so far by luck?” The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint looked at the Dragon Origin Great Saint with a playful smile.

This immediately placed the Dragon Origin Great Saint under tremendous pressure, and he squeezed out a smile, “This is nothing. It’s mainly because Qi Yu is too weak. He’s in the third transformation of the Nirvana Stage, and he can’t even defeat someone in the Profound Death Stage. So how is he not a piece of garbage?”

The lips of the other Saint Elders twitched when they heard that. Fortunately, Qi Yu wasn’t a saint’s disciple, or his master would probably have been angered to death on the spot.

“Then we’ll continue to watch and see how far this ‘ordinary’ disciple of yours can go,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said.

The other Saint Elders finally felt that something wasn’t right. The Nether Slaughtering Saint Sovereign’s face changed, and he wondered if the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint came here for Ye Qingtian.

The Dragon Origin Great Saint did his best to maintain his composure, but he was already panicking because the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint didn’t bother concealing her objective. It looks like he had to find a way.

When his gaze fell onto Lin Yun, he couldn’t help becoming furious. Doesn’t Lin Yun know how to keep a low profile?
