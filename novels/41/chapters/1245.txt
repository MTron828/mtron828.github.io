Chapter 1246 - Undercurrent

“I think this is it!” Lin Yun had a feeling that he was right. He immediately closed his eyes, but he wasn’t in a hurry because he wanted his sword aura and origin energy to recover. Unfortunately, the recovery speed of his sword soul was a lot slower than he had estimated. It took an entire day and night for his azure dragon sword soul to get back to normal.

When Lin Yun opened his eyes, he took a deep breath on the altar and clasped his hands in front of his chest. At the same time, the golden human in his forehead made the same movements.

Then, the golden human began to blaze with flames that radiated like a bright sun. This bizarre sensation made Lin Yun feel like the golden human was connected to him. It felt like he had a clone. Lightning and wind surged violently in the sword ocean, and the azure dragon burst out of the ocean under the golden human’s control.

“Break!” Lin Yun roared inwardly and the azure dragon flew out of his forehead. He could sense that the moment the azure dragon flew out of his forehead, it went beyond his control. When the dragon's head flew out of his forehead, it immediately showed signs of dissipating like his previous attempts.

“Condense!” Lin Yun was experienced now, so he was ready. The golden human in his sword ocean exploded with dazzling golden brilliance as the boundless sword intent empowered the azure dragon. Then, the azure dragon was forced to condense.

When the entire dragon flew out of his forehead, it manifested into a sword ray dozens of feet long. It instantly tore apart the space in front of Lin Yun.

When the sword ray dissipated, the remnant power was like a huge wave that rippled into the surroundings. When Lin Yun raised his head, the space before him began to distort and the surrounding scenery turned blurry. Then, the space in front of Lin Yun cracked like a mirror.

The terrifying phenomenon only lasted for a brief moment before it repaired itself. Lin Yun took a deep breath because the power was even more terrifying than before.

If there was a lesser Elysium Core Realm expert standing before him, they would be torn to pieces under his attack. Suddenly, Lin Yun was overcome with exhaustion and he nearly collapsed onto the ground. He had exhausted the majority of the azure dragon sword soul and the golden human.

He was certain that others had considered this move before, but it was impossible for them to execute such an attack if they didn’t have dual sword souls.

“I’m going to call this move the Divine Azure Annihilation!” Lin Yun muttered. Since it was a combination of the azure dragon and the divine firmament, he would name it so. Plus, it annihilated everything in his path.

Next up, Lin Yun continued to examine the profundity of the divine firmament sword intent. When the golden human turned into a golden beam and was released from his body, it instantly merged with the sea of clouds and manifested a sky.

When the sky descended, space constantly exploded under the compression and a far away mountain peak instantly collapsed. The divine firmament sword intent filled his meridians before they exited through his pores, allowing him to emit a dazzling brilliance. With sword aura empowering him, Lin Yun’s aura reached an unbelievable height.

“I think it’s time to look at the next level of the Nine Li Illusion Realm.” Lin Yun took out the jade flute as he planned on using his divine firmament sword intent to wield the flute and make it through the next five levels.

Previously, his music was lacking and he couldn’t bring out its full power. But now that he had the divine firmament sword intent, he should be able to fill in the blanks. With the divine firmament sword intent, Lin Yun started to feel confident about his upcoming trip to the Profound Wither Island.

Even if he didn’t get any stronger, he still had to go to the Profound Wither Island. After all, Lin Yun wouldn’t let anyone have something that was connected to the Profound Wither Great Saint, the painting, or the Flower Burial Sword.

If his plans didn’t change, his trip to the Profound Wither Island would be his last fight in the Profound Azure Prefecture. After that, he would leave for the Sword Sect. So Lin Yun didn’t want to leave behind any regrets no matter what.

Lin Yun’s gaze gradually became firm as he took out more divine astral pellets. When flames blazed on the altar, Lin Yun held onto the jade flute and kept his eyes open while sensing the war drums. Now that he was familiar with the illusion realm, he could bring a few items in.

While Lin Yun was in seclusion, news of the Profound Wither Island spread out swiftly. Various powerful sects were sending out Samsara Edict Realm experts to see what was happening.

As more and more experts arrived in the Profound Azure Prefecture, the local forces were full of shock. Samsara Edict Realm experts who were rarely seen were appearing out of nowhere.

Samsara Edict Realm experts were rare even in the Ancient Barren Domain. As long as saints didn’t show up, Samsara Edict Realm experts were the strongest group of experts from a powerful sect. In fact, every single Samsara Edict Realm expert was a heavyweight in their own sect.

Experts like them wouldn’t show up for something trivial. After all, the stronger one was, the more precious their time was. Clearly, news of the Profound Wither Island’s opening was worthy of their time.

The nine emperors stood out in the darkest era and established the Divine Dragon Empire, so anything related to them would definitely draw the attention of others. As one of the Nine Emperors who was confirmed to have died, there were many legends shrouding the Southern Emperor. His death was strange and had become one of the best kept secrets in Kunlun Realm.

So as the sole heir of the Southern Emperor, there was a possibility that the Profound Wither island had clues about the Southern Emperor. Even if there weren’t any secrets about the Southern Emperor, the Profound Wither Great Saint’s inheritance alone was tempting.

Ten days later, a bit of news began to spread. The storm that enveloped the Profound Wither Island would weaken ten days from now. According to the Profound Wither Great Saint’s will, only Empyrean Realm geniuses could reach the island.

Just like that, news spread out rapidly in the Ancient Barren Domain, giving powerful sects and saint clans shock. Many geniuses on the Empyrean Ranking began to head over to try their luck. After all, no one could say that they weren’t interested in the Profound Wither Great Saint’s inheritance.

In the Saint Zhao Clan, Zhao Yan was in seclusion when he received the news from an elder from the clan. As the leader of his generation, Zhao Yan had a high rank on the Empyrean Realm.

“The patriarch has made the decision to let you go to the Profound Wither Island.” The black-clothed elder said to Zhao Yan and wore a complicated gaze. Ever since Zhao Yan came back from the Sword Assembly, he started working ten times harder on his cultivation.

He practiced his sword every single moment of the day and was swiftly becoming stronger. Even lesser Elysium Core Realm experts of his sect were no longer his opponent. They couldn’t even last ten moves against him anymore. It made the elders happy and afraid. They were happy that Zhao Yan was hardworking, but they were afraid that he might run amok due to his obsession. So it was good news that the Profound Wither island was opening.

“The Profound Wither Island? Is it located in the Profound Azure Prefecture?” Zhao Yan suddenly asked.

“That’s right,” said the black-clothed elder.

Zhao Yan’s eyes began to flicker. Isn’t that where the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect was located? Lin Yun should’ve reached the Empyrean Realm by now, so we can fight for real. Zhao Yan was confident that he could make it into the top 1,000 on the Empyrean Ranking with his current strength.

He had a huge harvest in his last battle with Lin Yun, which made his strength drastically transform. After all, he wasn’t willing to accept his loss to Lin Yun because he had to restrict his cultivation in the Heavenly Soul Realm.

Simultaneously, Gongsun Yan, who also lost to Lin Yun at the Sword Assembly, also received the news about the Profound Wither Island.

“The Profound Wither island?” Gongsun Yan was briefly stunned and surprised by the opening of the Profound Wither Great Saint’s inheritance. But he immediately thought of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect because it was also located in the Profound Azure Prefecture.

He knew that it was practically impossible for him to obtain the Profound Wither Great Saint’s inheritance. After all, this was something only those in the top 100 were qualified to compete for. Or rather, only those in the top ten had a high chance to obtain the inheritance.

Gongsun Yan naturally knew of the gap he had with those people since he had seen how strong they were. They were unbelievably strong monsters, but that didn’t mean that he had no chance at the great saint’s inheritance. If he was fortunate enough, it might be possible for him to obtain the inheritance.

Gongsun Yan paced around and his eyes gradually grew brighter. He knew that Lin Yun would also be there since it was the Profound Wither Island. Thinking about it, Gongsun Yan’s gaze became firm because he told Lin Yun that he would show Lin Yun how strong he was in their next meeting.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com
