Chapter 2252 - Reunion At Last

Even when the music ended, the echoes still reverberated around. Taking a deep breath, Lin Yun’s gaze was complicated as he looked down the waterfall. He said, “It’s Su Ziyao.”

It looked like the rumors were true for her to be forced to go this far. But judging from the music, she appeared in a pretty good state.

He was anxious, wanting to go down and take a look. But he calmed himself down in the end because he knew that he couldn’t be rash or he might lose his life. Su Ziyao was down below, which meant there were ways to go through the gravity and claw. Jumping down didn’t mean death.

“Have you ever thought of the possibility that there’s no way out from below? Otherwise, why didn’t she come out?” Lil’ Purple pointed out a crucial problem.

“Let’s talk after we go down. We’re also trapped here, so things might get better with the three of our brains together,” Lin Yun said. He knew that what Lil’ Purple said wasn’t wrong, but he wanted to meet Su Ziyao to confirm if she was safe.

“Hmph.” Lil’ Purple tugged her arms together and turned her head away in disdain as though she was saying she didn’t want to expose his thoughts.

“What’s the matter? You’re angry?” Lin Yun smiled.

With her head still turned away, Lil’ Purple said, “I’m not angry. Since you like her so much, you can go down on yourself. I’ll stay here!”

“Come down as well. Others don’t know, but I know your ability. You already figured out how to leave the Fallen God Valley, right?” Lin Yun smiled.

But Lil’ Purple merely snorted and didn’t reply.

“You know about the origin of that claw, right?” Lin Yun continued.

“I don’t know,” Lil’ Purple said furiously. After she was done, she noticed that her tone was a little too harsh, so she lowered her head, “Lin Yun, would you be willing to stay with me in the Fallen God Valley if not for Su Ziyao? This place is pretty good. It’s isolated from the outside world, and there’s nothing to care about, no Flower Burial.”

As she spoke, she was looking around at the same time.

“Of course, I’m willing,” Lin Yun smiled.

“Hmph, you’re really a scumbag!” Lil’ Purple furiously looked at Lin Yun. She said, “You won’t give the Divine Blood Fruit away?!”

“Oh, yeah. I still have to give away the Divine Blood Fruit,” Lin Yun said, realizing he had something to do.

Looking at Lin Yun, Lil’ Purple said furiously, “You scumbag. I knew that you were lying to me. But even if you lied to me, I’m still happy about it. You must mean what you say, or I’ll be angry!”

Lin Yun smiled and said nothing else because he knew that Lil’ Purple wouldn’t be angry about it, even if he really said that earlier. Lil’ Purple might be petty, but she wasn’t bad.

“There should be a deity’s hand down below, and that claw came from it,” Lil’ Purple said. “After the Iris Sword Box recovers, I can control the two Sovereign Divine Runes. In addition to the help of the Phoenix Tree, we should be able to block that claw.”

Lin Yun glanced at Lil’ Purple, and said, “So you already had a way down, and you still wanted me to risk my life. What happened earlier was really dangerous.”

Lil’ Purple was guilty as she lowered her head. She said, “That’s because you don’t care about me at all, and I wanted to teach you a lesson. But I didn’t expect that you would really jump down.”

“Alright, we’ll wait for the sword box to recover first,” Lin Yun said, caressing Lil’ Purple’s head. He used his saint aura to help the Iris Sword Box recover while Lil’ Purple borrowed Lin Yun’s Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute, and she would play it by the waterfall when she had nothing to do.

Five days later, the Iris Sword Box had recovered without any cracks.

“It’s fine now,” Lil’ Purple said. Seeing that Lin Yun wanted to carry the sword box, she said, “Let me do it.”

She explained, “The corpse of a deity releases the claw, so there’s no way a mortal body can withstand the power of a deity.”Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“What about you?” Lin Yun asked.

“Hmph, don’t forget I’m from the Divine Phoenix Clan. Even if my main body isn’t around, my soul is the soul of a phoenix, and I can be comparable to deities when regarding status,” Lil’ Purple said pridefully. “Furthermore, I have seen the strength of the Iris Secret Realm, and I understand it better than you.”

Lin Yun briefly pondered, but found that what Lil’ Purple said made sense.

“Stay in the Iris Secret Realm, and be reassured.” Lil’ Purple held onto the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute and wore an aloof expression.

Seeing the composure on her face, Lin Yun could only suppress the doubts in his heart for the time being. When he entered the Iris Secret Realm, Lil’ Purple waved her hand and the Iris Sword Box flew over. She jumped and landed on the sword box, using it like a sword to fly.

When her small figure stood on the sword box, she looked like a little girl standing on a mountain. But when the divine runes on her forehead began to shine, the aura that she gave off increased. Her hair turned silver and began to grow to reach her waist. As her silver hair fluttered, she played the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute and flew down into the abyss.

When she played the flute, a rumbling sound came from the Iris Secret Realm and the two Sovereign Divine Runes flew out.

Lin Yun sat beneath the Phoenix Tree, watching this scene with shock. When the two Sovereign Divine Runes flew out, they had manifested into a powerful gale and lightning that swiftly combined with a divine aura that spread out within the Iris Secret Realm, making Lin Yun feel insignificant before it.

“This is the true power of the Sovereign Divine Runes?” Lin Yun was shocked in his heart. He had a feeling that Lil’ Purple had to pay a great price to use the two Sovereign Divine Runes in this manner.

But when he stood up, two branches reached out from the Phoenix Tree, pressing him back down. The entire Iris Secret Realm began to tremble, and the shaking was even more terrifying than when he jumped down the Fallen God Valley, looking as though it would shatter the next moment.

“She’s pushing it again?” Lin Yun was concerned as he formed a saint seal. As light shone in his eyes, he could see the outside world, and it was a shocking scene. Lil’ Purple had grown to appear to be about fourteen years old with her silver hair draped down, fluttering in the wind.

Lin Yun already knew Lil’ Purple was a beauty, but he didn’t expect her to be so charming with a fourteen-year-old figure. She looked flawless with a noble temperament, and the divine runes on her forehead made her look overbearing. Her eyes were closed as she played the flute with the two Sovereign Divine Runes revolving around her.

Suddenly, the claw arrived. The claw gave off a powerful and baleful aura that swept at the Iris Sword Box, accompanied by ghostly screams that could shatter a person’s soul from the sound alone.

“No…” Lin Yun’s heart clenched because he knew how terrifying the claw was.

But Lil’ Purple suddenly opened her eyes and flew out, lighting up the entire abyss as her hair began to flutter under the strong wind. She roared, “The mere remains of a corpse dares to be presumptuous before me? I am of the Divine Phoenix Clan, the Heavenly Slaughter Emperor of the Four Seas, Eight Barrens, 36 Heavens, and 72 Earths!”

When Lil’ Purple threw out the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute, it shot out, accompanied by the power of the divine runes, creating a tiny hole in the claw before cracks began to spread.

“It doesn’t seem so impressive after all.” Lil’ Purple smiled as she crouched down, grabbing the top of the sword box with her right hand.

As an Iris Flower bloomed on the surface of the Iris Sword Box, the image of an Ice Phoenix appeared that flew out with the sword box, shattering the claw. When the sword box shone brightly, Lil’ Purple soared to the sky and grabbed onto the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute.

But the claw seemed furious as space began to distort.

“Ha!” Lil’ Purple laughed in disdain as the Imperial Tune began to resound from the flute. When the two shockwaves clashed, Lil’ Purple stood on the sword box, acting like a raft in the ocean, and Lil’ Purple was standing at the front of the raft, facing the waves while the raft charged through them.

Lin Yun was dazzled by this scene with disbelief. Although he knew Lil’ Purple had secrets, he didn’t expect her to be so shocking. He began to wonder how strong Lil’ Purple was at her prime. All her boasting wasn’t true, right?

The Iris Sword Box flew like a sword while Lil’ Purple executed various means, shattering all the incoming claws.

“We’ve almost reached the bottom!” Lin Yun’s eyes lit up as he saw a pond at the bottom of the waterfall, and there was a river stretching out from the pond, leading to an unknown location.

Right then, Lil’ Purple threw out a mouthful of blood as she fell off the Iris Sword Box, and the radiance he gave off dissipated.

Lin Yun’s face changed as he broke free of the Phoenix Tree and flew out of the Iris Secret Realm. The moment he came out, he felt a powerful gravity crushing down on him, nearly ripping him apart.

But Lin Yun was calm as he activated the Azure Dragon Divine Physique and reached out to grab Lil’ Purple’s arm. When Lin Yun held onto Lil’ Purple, they looked at each other while Lin Yun didn’t hesitate to pull her into his embrace, firmly standing before her, using his back to brave the gravity.

“Damn it, you show off!” Lil’ Purple smiled as she looked at Lin Yun with her pale face. She was weak, but she had a smile and no pain. She looked at Lin Yun’s face, and tears began to roll down her cheeks.

“You’re a phoenix, so you shouldn’t cry,” Lin Yun comforted, wiping her tears.

“Even a phoenix… has a heart,” Lil’ Purple said softly.

“That’s for sure. But do you look older as you become stronger?” Lin Yun asked with a smile.

Wearing a smug face, Lil’ Purple smiled, “How is it? I’m pretty, right? I already told you I’m definitely prettier than Su Ziyao when I recover my original appearance.”

Lin Yun couldn’t help smiling because Lil’ Purple was really a child with how her emotions changed.

When they landed on the Iris Sword Box, the sword box was like a small boat that went with the flow of the current.

An hour later, a small island appeared before Lin Yun. This island had a towering tree at the center of it, and there was a woman with her hands on the zither, looking in his direction.

This person was naturally Su Ziyao. They both looked at each other with smiles while she played the zither. When the Iris Sword Box reached the island, Lin Yun walked over to Su Ziyao, carrying Lil’ Purple.

Lil’ Purple had returned to her appearance as a child, and was feeling shy at this moment, not daring to raise her head from Lin Yun’s shoulder. She would naturally be happy to have Lin Yun carry her if it were the usual. But before Su Ziyao, she couldn’t help feeling ashamed. After all, she looked no different from being Lin Yun’s daughter.

She couldn’t break free and only pouted her lips unhappily, “Why do I have to return to a child’s appearance again at this critical moment!”
