Chapter 2189: Night Of The Ninth

There wasn’t a hint of hesitation in Tian Xuanzi’s tone. Although everyone had guessed that Tian Xuanzi would stand out to stop the Radiant Sword Saint from undergoing his tribulation, they were still shocked to hear Tian Xuanzi speaking it so blatantly. He was arrogant, and didn’t bother concealing his ambitions at all.

It wasn’t righteous to attack the Radiant Sword Saint when he was undergoing his tribulation, and it could even be considered despicable.

“Very well, it looks like you don’t even bother concealing yourself anymore,” Ye Guhan said coldly. “I can tell you honestly that if you want to undergo your tribulation, my master won’t disrupt you, and he will fight you fairly.”

Tian Xuanzi was briefly stunned, before he said, “I believe in what you say, and this is why I’m not him. I can’t reach his height, and I can’t be like him who wants to be comparable to the Nine Emperors. This is why I wanted to make a move against him in his tribulation or I wouldn’t have any chances left.”

Tian Xuanzi was blatant with hi intent, and he didn’t bother concealing that he couldn’t be compared to the Radiant Sword Saint. “There are many good and bad people in the world. If I don’t have a choice, I would rather become a bad person.”

Ye Guhan was speechless as he looked at Tian Xuanzi, wanting to notice the reluctance and unwillingness in his eyes, but there were none. Tian Xuanzi’s gaze was pure, purely wanting the Radiant Sword Saint’s death.

Recalling the past, Ye Guhan suddenly looked unfamiliar to him, and this was no longer the same Tian Xuanzi he once knew.

“I’ll be taking my leave now,” Tian Xuanzi smiled. But he suddenly stopped, and looked at Lin Yun with a smile, “I was actually looking forward to seeing if you could recall the Emperor Sword, but alas… the Heavenly Dao Sect is no longer the same as before. If you had insisted on giving it a try, chaos would probably take place in the Heavenly Dao Sect without me making a move. They’re afraid of you, and they can see the limitless potential in you. But I’m not afraid of you, and I hope that you can become stronger. It doesn’t matter if you’re Flower Burial Lin Yun or Heavenly Dragon Lord Ye Qingtian because I’m fearless.”

The Gale Rein Great Saint squinted when he heard that, and he even had a faint chill in his eyes as he looked at Tian Xuanzi. With a smile, he stepped forth, and interrupted Tian Xuanzi, “Great Saint, it’s time for you to leave.

“Honored guests, the Thousand Plume Great Saint’s condition is uncertain, so the Heavenly Dao Sect won’t keep you guys around anymore,” the Gale Rein Great Saint said as he looked at the other guests.

Everyone’s expressions became playful. They had a feeling that the Heavenly Dao Sect would fall into chaos soon, as soon as half a month or as late as six months. At that time, the Heavenly Dao Sect would only have a leader left.

The Heavenly Dao Sect’s first layer was ripped apart by Tian Xuanzi, so it was just a matter of time for chaos to take place. They were more than willing to allow that to happen, and they had no opinions about it. They had to admit that the events today were pretty exciting.

“Great Saint, it’s time for you to leave,” the Gale Rein Great Saint smiled as he looked at Tian Xuanzi.

“Why are you in a hurry?” Tian Xuanzi suddenly asked. But before the Gale Rein Great Saint could reply, Tian Xuanzi pushed his palm forth.

When the Gale Rein Great Saint took the palm head-on, the altar shattered and the Gale Rein Great Saint threw out a mouthful of blood, taking a few steps back.

“How dare you!” The Wang Clan’s experts stepped forth along with some Saints of the Heavenly Dao Sect, and they began to release their saint auras.

But Tian Xuanzi was fearless when facing them, and the seven saints behind him stepped forth to withstand the massive saint auras.

“Don’t move!” The Gale Rein Great Saint waved his hand with panic on his face.

“Interesting, you’re stronger than I’ve imagined. It was no wonder why you dared to interrupt me,” Tian Xuanzi said coldly. “I can leave, but only on my own accord. I will not be chased out by you.”

Tian Xuanzi was overbearing and arrogant. This was clearly the territory of the Heavenly Dao Sect, but the aura he gave off was stronger than the Gale Rein Great Saint, causing the Heavenly Dao Sect’s disciples to grit their teeth.

If it was normal, Tian Xuanzi definitely wouldn’t dare to be so arrogant, even if he was strong. But the Thousand Plume Great Saint’s condition was uncertain, and the Gale Rein Great Saint only wanted to appease this matter. So there was nothing they could do about Tian Xuanzi’s attitude.

Tian Xuanzi’s gaze fell onto Lin Yun again, and he smiled, “Ye Qingtian, see what I said? They’re really afraid of you, but I’m not afraid of you. I will be waiting for you.”

Lin Yun smiled, “I feel that you should be afraid. After all, even I’m afraid of myself when I go insane.”

Lin Yun might be smiling, but his eyes were radiating with murderous intent. He had thought it through, and he had to be calmer than Tian Xuanzi when facing the latter.

“I know. So I will be waiting for you.” Tian Xuanzi said, and he left for real this time.

But his words made everyone baffled because Tian Xuanzi sounded as though he had confirmed that Ye Qingtian was Flower Burial, and he didn’t make a move when this was a good opportunity. Not to mention that he addressed Lin Yun as Ye Qingtian, not Flower Burial or Lin Yun.

But no one could be bothered about that because the Thousand Plume Great Saint threw out another mouthful of blood under the Serene Dust Great Saint’s treatment. After that, the Thousand Plume Great Saint fainted.

With that, the Heavenly Dao Sect fell into compete chaos.

“Return to the Dao Yang Palace,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint calmly said, which the Dao Yang Holy Son obeyed.

The Dragon Origin Great Saint went with him while the Serene Dust Great Saint and Heavenly Jade Sword Saint stayed behind to keep an eye on the Gale Rein Great Saint and Tough Peak Saint Sovereign.

“Do the two of you have to be so hostile towards me that you even forbid me from taking a look at a fellow friend?” The Gale Rein Great Saint wiped the blood off his lips, looking at the Serene Dust Great Saint and Heavenly Jade Sword Saint.

“There’s no need for you to take a look at him. The Thousand Plume Great Saint is fine, so you don’t have to worry about him,” the Serene Dust Great Saint wasn’t polite at all, creating a tense atmosphere. Even the disciples of the seventy-two peaks could feel that something wasn’t right.

“I hope so,” the Gale Rein Great Saint said and left with the Tough Peak Saint Sovereign.

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint didn’t stay there for long, but chased after the Dragon Origin Great Saint and Dao Yang Holy Son. Evidently, the Thousand Plume Great Saint’s injuries weren't as light as what the Serene Dust Great Saint had said.

The Serene Dust Great Saint waved her hand to call Lin Yun and Xin Yan over.

“The two of you stay in the Profound Maiden Courtyard and don’t go anywhere, no matter what happens. Understood?” The Serene Dust Great Saint, and she raised her head, “Azure River, you go with them.”

Ye Guhan nodded while Xin Yan was still surprised because she had no idea what was going on. But before she could ask about it, the Serene Dust Great Saint left in a hurry, heading to the Dao Yang Holy Palace with the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Lin Yun wore a grave expression as he looked at the three Great Saints heading to the Dao Yang Holy Palace. It looked like something big was going to take place in the Heavenly Dao Sect tonight, and someone wanted the Thousand Plume Great Saint’s death.

Lin Yun looked at Ye Guhan and immediately said what Wang Muyan told him before. But surprisingly, Ye Guhan was calm, and he smiled, “I know. We all know. But leave it to them. As for the two of you, come with me to the Profound Maiden Courtyard.”

Lin Yun turned around, wanting to find Wang Muyan. But she had already left, so Lin Yun immediately said, “Senior Brother, Wang Muyan is missing.”

“That lass isn’t that important, so there’s no need to pay so much attention to her. You’re more important than her,” Ye Guhan said.

Lin Yun bit on his lips, and his face changed. What Ye Guhan said wasn’t wrong. If chaos broke out within the Heavenly Dao Sect, even a Saint might not be safe. So there was no way Wang Muyan could change the situation, but Lin Yun felt that something wasn’t right somewhere.

He swept his gaze and saw Bai Shuying, who was looking at him with a complicated gaze. She seemed to have something to say, wanting to come over. But she was stopped by a Saint Sovereign not any weaker than Ye Guhan. This was the ancestor of the Bai Clan, the Absolute Dust Saint Sovereign.

The Absolute Dust Saint Sovereign had a strong stance as he forcibly brought Bai Shuying to the Nether Orchid Courtyard along with the members of the Bai Clan.

As for the Holy Spirit Son, he was brought to the Holy Spirit Courtyard by the ancestor of the Zhang Clan. The two clans had formed a rapport to watch, so they wouldn’t help either side. Many disciples were also restrained by their own peak masters. The ceremony should have been a grand event, but it ended in tragedy.

Anyone could tell that something wasn’t right from the conversation between the Serene Dust Great Saint and Gale Rein Great Saint, but most disciples had no idea what was going on. Only a few disciples noticed something, and their gazes became complicated, not knowing what they should do.

“Let’s go.” Ye Guhan led Lin Yun and Xin Yan away, and it didn’t take long for the plaza to be cleared. The plaza was crowded and filled with people a moment ago, but it was terrifyingly calm now, looking desolate and deserted.

On the top of the mountain in the distance, Zhao Tianyu and Gu Xinyu stood up with their expressions becoming grave. Zhao Tianyu said in a grave tone, “Wang Muyan has gone to the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda, so it’s time for us to act.”

Gu Xinyu nodded as they bumped their fists together. They both spoke out with firm belief in their eyes, ““As long as the fire is blazing, the divine cult will exist for eternity!””

Behind them, there was a bizarre array setup with blood. When night fell, flames began to ignite from the nodes of the array. This was a desolate valley, and not many disciples would come here. There was also a group of people guarding outside, so no one would notice the array.

Most importantly, this was the back mountain of the Heavenly Yin Palace, and it was hard for anyone to come in, even if there was a huge commotion. But if Lin Yun was there, he would sigh that his speculation was right.

Since he could make it into the Heavenly Dao Sect through Ye Guhan, others could do the same. For the past few hundred years, the Heavenly Dao Sect was already riddled with holes.

When the moon soared to the sky, the flames became even more bizarre, red like blood and looking alive.

On the Celestial Purging Mountain, there was a pavilion in the sky where Tian Xing played the zither with the Crane Fairy beside him, playing with the sword in her hand. That was the Heavenly Dipper Sword, and Lin Yun asked the Indigothunder Peak Master to deliver it there in accordance to Lin Yun’s instructions after it was delivered to the sect.

“This sword is really beautiful,” the Crane Fairy smiled, looking lively and innocent.

“This is a good sword. The Hidden Sword Manor is the best sword-making holy land in the world after all.” Tian Xing sighed, and he bitterly smiled, “Three thousand years ago, I didn’t have the Emperor Sword with me and was defeated. Three thousand years later, Qianyu wasn’t able to confront the Firmament Sword. It seems like the Heavenly Dao Sect is always lacking a good sword.”

He took the Heavenly Dipper Sword from the Crane Fairy, and he overlooked the entire Heavenly Dao Sect. The ninth of this month was destined to be a long day.
