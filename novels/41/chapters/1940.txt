Chapter 1941 - Seclusion

Lin Yun looked carefully around, and noticed that the True Dragon Saint Liquid in the cauldron was red. But the True Dragon Saint Liquid was pure without a hint of the smell of blood, giving off spiritual energy instead. It was like a crystal liquid, emitting a blinding radiance.

“The True Dragon Saint Liquid here is different from the outside world, and the materials are at least monarch demonic beasts that are over five hundred years old. They generally possess an ancient Dragon Clan’s bloodline,” Bai Xiao explained. “This seventh-grade True Dragon Saint Liquid. It’s ranked from the first to ninth grades, and those above the fifth grade can be considered high grades. So this is a high grade amongst the high grades.”

Without him saying anything, Lin Yun naturally sensed the difference as well. The True Dragon Saint Liquid he used in the past was roughly at the third grade. The purity of this level couldn’t be bought with money, and even the Heavenly Astral Pavilion couldn’t refine it themselves. This required a holy land's foundation, giving Lin Yun an eye-opening experience.Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“What about the eighth and ninth grade?” Lin Yun asked curiously.

“The eighth grade is refined with a thousand-year-old jiao-dragons, and they could be considered mixed blood dragons. But they’re a whole new level away from the other dragon-blooded demonic beasts,” Bai Xiao smiled. He continued, “As for the ninth grade, it’s refined with the blood of true dragons, and the Heavenly Dao Sect only has half a cauldron of that.”

Lin Yun was shocked, hearing that the Heavenly Dao Sect even had ninth grade True Dragon Saint Liquid. After all, true dragons could no longer be seen in the current Divine Dragon Era.

“Above the ninth grade is the Divine Dragon Saint Liquid, which is extremely rare. Perhaps only the Divine Dragon Empire has it,” Bai Xiao continued.

“Junior Brother Ye, the one in the lake is more than enough if you plan to temper your physique. And there’s no need to spend all your contribution points on it,” Wang Yue said. He wanted to advise Ye Qingtian long ago because it was five hundred thousand contribution points, and Ye Qingtian didn’t even bat his eye at exchanging all of them for True Dragon Saint Liquid.

“Ther’s no need to worry. I’ll get two thousand kilograms of True Dragon Saint Liquid, then.” Lin Yun had already made up his mind.

“Okay, I’ll arrange it immediately. Do you still need the Divine Sunchasing Art?” Bai Xiao asked. He knew the reward for becoming the champion of the Di Group was five hundred thousand contribution points, and this was an astronomical sum that ordinary saint disciples might not be able to accumulate, even if they spent ten years. But Lin Yun didn’t even bat his eye at using them all up.

“Yeah,” Lin Yun replied.

Bai Xiao and Wang Yue exchanged a gaze because Ye Qingtian shouldn’t have more contribution points for the Divine Sunchasing Art.

After they left the chamber, Bai Xiao brought them to the Hidden Record Chamber. There were densely packed jade slips here, and each jade slip emitted a different radiance. Bai Xiao said that the jade slips emitting a red radiance were ghost spirit martial techniques.

Lin Yun took a rough glance, and there were at least a thousand jade slips. This naturally made him dumbfounded, and he wondered if the Sword Sect was also this glorious in the past. Then again, this was also the benefit of a powerful force.

“The Divine Sunchasing Art is a little complicated because it’s divided into various sections, the Profound Martial, Violet Palace, Heavenly Soul, Empyrean, Elysian Core, Dragon Pulse, Samsara Edict, and Saint Realms.” Bai Xiao looked at Lin Yun with a brief hesitation and continued, “You’ll need at least four hundred thousand contribution points to exchange for them.”

“Why don’t I loan you some?” Wang Yue asked.

“I can also loan you some,” Bai Xiao said. He was a Quasi-Saint and a member of the Golden Guard. So he naturally had some accumulation, not to mention he had just crossed the age of a hundred, and he didn’t put on any airs as a Quasi-Saint Realm expert.

“Thanks, but it’s alright.” Lin Yun took out the medal before Wang Yue and Bai Xiao could respond. But his medal differed from the other saint’s disciples because there was a trace of blood, the blood of a Great Saint.

When Wang Yue and Bai Xiao saw the blood on the medal, their faces changed, and they looked at Ye Qingtian with disbelief. That was especially the case for Wang Yue because his status was already beneath Ye Qingtian as an ordinary Saint’s disciple. The gap between them only increased now because Ye Qingtian actually became the Dragon Origin Great Saint’s secluded disciple. This meant Ye Qingtian had become the Great Origin Great Saint’s successor.

In a nutshell, Ye Qingtian would inherit the wealth of a Great Saint when the Dragon Origin Great Saint dies, and they couldn’t imagine the wealth that Ye Qingtian would inherit.

Bai Xiao took a deep breath to calm himself down and said, “Junior Brother Ye, come with me. Before the Dragon Origin Great Saint became a Saint Elder, he left behind many contribution points.”

Wang Yue could no longer follow them, so he bitterly smiled, looking at Bai Xiao and Ye Qingtian’s silhouettes. Even if he became his master’s secluded disciple, there was no way a Saint Lord could be comparable to a Great Saint, not to mention Wang Yue was only one of his master’s many disciples, and this meant other people were competing with him.

He couldn’t help feeling jealous while looking at Lin Yun’s silhouette. He muttered, “Why didn’t the Dragon Origin Great Saint take me as his disciple back then…?”

On the highest floor of the Contribution Hall, Bai Xiao flipped through the book and raised his head, “The Dragon Origin Great Saint left behind eight million contribution points, and you are to inherit them by the rules.”

Lin Yun opened his mouth in shock, shocked by what Bai Xiao said. He exclaimed, “So much?”

“After becoming a Saint Elder, they no longer needed contribution points. But they’ll leave some to be inherited,” Bai Xiao smiled. “But even so, the amount of contribution points left behind by the Dragon Origin Great Saint is more than the others. Alright, how do you plan on using them?”

“Exchange all of them to the True Dragon Saint Liquid aside from the Divine Sunchasing Art,” Lin Yun said after a brief pondering.

“What?” Bai Xiao exclaimed in shock. If Ye Qingtian exchanged all the contribution points to True Dragon Saint Liquid, it would be about half a cauldron, which was a little too unbelievable. But he could do nothing about it because Ye Qingtian was the secluded disciple of a Great Saint. He coughed and said, “You can also get Golden Crow’s blood or saint feathers with them. Don’t you want to practice the Divine Sunchasing Art? They will naturally come in handy.”

“That works as well. Exchange the remaining contribution points for True Dragon Saint Liquid,” Lin Yun said, nodding his head.

Bai Xiao became speechless because it appeared that Ye Qingtian was really determined about getting the True Dragon Saint Liquid. With so much, Ye Qingtian would need a few years to finish it.

When Lin Yun left the Contribution Hall, he left with nearly twenty thousand kilograms of True Dragon Saint Liquid, sixty kilograms of Golden Crow’s saint blood, the complete Divine Sunchasing Art, and eighteen Golden Crow’s saint feathers.

He initially wanted to exchange Golden Crow’s plume feathers, but those were too rare within the Heavenly Dao Sect. The rarity of plum feathers was on a whole new level than the ordinary feathers.

When he came out of the Contribution Hall, Wang Yue was waiting outside for him. He said, “I already thought about it, and my Life Intent isn’t exactly a secret. You do not need to teach me that sword technique in exchange.”

“Oh?” Lin Yun exclaimed in surprise.

“The God Burial Forest has a valley called the Myriad Graves Valley. The sky of this valley is covered in blood clouds of sins, and countless blood crows reside there,” Wang Yue said. He continued, “But this place contains brimming vitality, and many people will risk there lives to comprehend Life Intent and its fate if you can comprehend it. So I can’t teach you even if I have grasped it.”

Lin Yun engraved the Myriad Graves Valley within his mind. He wasn’t hurrying to grasp the Life Intent, but his goal was the Life-Death Intent. The Divine Firmament Sword Sutra grasped death aura, while the Blue Dragon Bone represented vitality. So he might be able to combine the Life and Death Intents if he could comprehend their profundities. Then again, he still had a long way to go, and he could only comprehend it slowly, even after reaching the Quasi-Saint Realm.

“What’s that sword called? You only need to tell me the name of it,” Wang Yue asked.

As Lin Yun recollected his thoughts, he smiled, “I created this sword technique, and it’s called Sword of the Beginning. So it’s not exactly wrong to call it Light of the Beginning as well.”

“You created it?” Wang Yue was dumbfounded and said, “Ye Qingtian, do you think I’m a fool? Even my master might not be able to create such a sword technique. It must have been given to you by the Dragon Origin Great Saint.”

He was practically certain that this sword technique was an ancient sword technique and that it should be incomplete because the Wang Clan also had similar incomplete martial techniques. They were highly valuable, but perfecting them wasn't easy.

“Life is really lonely when no one believes me, even if I’m speaking the truth. You can come to me anytime if you want to learn it,” Lin Yun said, and he laughed as he left. He had no intention of arguing with Wang Yue about it.

When Lin Yun returned to his courtyard, Lil’ Purple still hadn’t returned yet, but Lin Yun wasn’t in a hurry to water the Phoenix Tree with True Dragon Saint Liquid. He wanted to let Lil’ Purple do it, and she would definitely be happy about it.

As he smiled, he entered the Three-Lives Realm. He had a lot of resources, and he planned to cultivate them for a long time. Looking at the Three-Lives Fruit in his hand, he muttered, “It should be enough for half a year…”

It was thanks to the Three-Lives Fruit that his strength had undergone such a huge improvement so quickly. He planned to reach the seventh channel of the Profound Death Stage in one go.

It was impossible in the past, but he had three hundred thousand Nirvana Pellets, the Golden Crow’s saint blood, and even the True Dragon Saint Liquid. The saint blood and saint liquid couldn’t be used to increase his cultivation, but they were rare treasures that could benefit his cultivation.

Time waits for no one, and he must quickly improve his strength.
