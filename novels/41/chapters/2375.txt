Chapter 2376 - We Can Chat But Don't Think About Giving Up

Lin Yun’s domineering words echoed across Heavenly Barren Saint Mountain, causing the surrounding mountains to tremble as he released the powerful aura of a Saint.

On the stage, Tuoba Hong’s skeleton lay on the ground, reeking with blood. Many people frowned upon seeing this, and everyone became silent.

“H-How did you do that?” Everyone was dumbfounded as they looked at Lin Yun with shock.

“What’s going on?” The other geniuses looked at Lin Yun, who donned an azure robe with his hair fluttering in the wind. But this time, that face was filled with arrogance and murderous intent.

“Isn’t this too unfathomable?”

“What irony. Tuoba Hong said he was invincible beneath the moon, and yet Lin Yun easily defeated him.”

“He was the most arrogant before the fight, and even asked the Profound Sky Venerable if he could kill, acting as though Lin Yun was already in his hands.”

“Is he dead?”

“How can Saints die so easily? But he’s no different from being dead...” The arrogant words Tuoba Hong said earlier were sarcastic now, and the atmosphere on the stage became cold. The other geniuses wore grave expressions when they saw this scene, and they didn’t have their arrogance from before. When Lin Yun raised his head to look at them, their eyes changed with shock in their hearts.

“Why aren’t you guys calling out anymore? Weren’t you guys really loud earlier? Saying that you would kill me before competing for the lotus stages... I didn’t hear incorrectly, right?” Lin Yun smiled. He was as composed as before, and there was a hint of mockery in his tone.

Jiang Ziyao and Heavenly Book said nothing as their faces became dark.

Mu Qianxue looked at Tuoba Hong, who was struggling to recover. He coldly said, “Lin Yun, aren’t you a little too ruthless? We’re just competing for the quotas, so is there a need to take it so far?”

“This isn’t enough, but don’t worry. I will make him die again after he recovers,” Lin Yun smiled. His tone was calm as he spoke the most ruthless words.

Mu Qianxue’s face changed with a hint of fear flashing on his face, and asked, “What do you want?”

“I’m game if you guys want to fight. If you guys want to fight with your life on the line, I’m also up for it,” Lin Yun smiled as he looked around. “In a nutshell, you guys can decide, since I’m invincible. You guys can choose to come at me one by one or together.”

When Lin Yun said that, everyone in the surrounding area was shocked because he was too arrogant. But with Tuoba Hong as a living example, no one dared to belittle what Lin Yun said.

Mu Qianxue was shocked by what Lin Yun said, but he didn’t know how to reply to that. His lips twitched, and his face was ugly.

Qin Yun said, “Since you possess such strength, why did you use a trick to deal with us on the ancient battlefield? We paid a great price after being surrounded by thousands of demonic corpses, and we barely got out.” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“You’re speaking as if you’re innocent. Weren’t you guys the ones who plotted against me first?” Lin Yun sneered. “Don’t make yourself look like a gentleman when you’re not one. You guys can come at me one by one or together.”

Qin Yun raised his brow, before he became furious. He came from the Dao Sect, and he had a high position within the sect. The Dao Sect also had an Ancestral Stage expert, so who would dare to be so disrespectful to him?

“You’re arrogant. Do you think you’re invincible just because you defeated Tuoba Hong?” Mu Qianxue couldn’t hold it back, and coldly continued, “Let me face you, then.”

“By yourself?” Lin Yun raised his brow.

“Can Jue, you go with Mu Qianxue. Since he asked for it, let’s play with him, then,” Jiang Ziyao said. But his words made Can Jue frown since they were peerless geniuses, and because of their pride, they didn’t want to gang up on Lin Yun. Even if they won, it wouldn’t look good for them.

“There’s no need to hold back against someone like him,” Jiang Ziyao said.

“Okay,” Can Jue nodded, looking at Tuoba Hong. He looked at Lin Yun, and coldly said, “It’s unfair for us to fight against you at the same time, so consider it your win if you can last for ten moves.”

“Spar or deathmatch?” Lin Yun smiled.

Can Jue frowned. Isn’t Lin Yun too arrogant? He initially wanted to say they would engage in a deathmatch, but he hesitated after looking at Tuoba Hong’s condition.

Mu Qianxue said, “A spar will do. We will give up if you win.”

“Alright. Since we’re only sparring, I will only cripple your hands,” Lin Yun said indifferently, and his words caused an uproar. Jiang Ziyao and Heavenly Book might be the culprits back on the ancient battlefield, but Lin Yun wouldn’t mind dealing with them if they were foolish. However, if they weren’t foolish, then they would only be taught a lesson by him.

“Flower Burial, you’re too arrogant!” Can Jue coldly said, before a black blade appeared in his hand. Mu Qianxue was also furious and a sword appeared, before they both released their auras. They were both eighth-stage Saint Lords, and they had condensed the stars in their violet palace.

“You will be defeated within ten moves!” The two didn’t hold back and even released their constellations. They had a good relationship, so they had a strong rapport. The moment they made a move, they charged at Lin Yun from both sides, and the intent that they gave off was different.

There was a heavenly river behind Mu Qianxue with countless stars rising and falling within.

“The Heavenly River Sword!” Someone recognized the sword technique that Mu Qianxue was using. It was the famous Heavenly River Sword, a transcendent-grade dragon spirit martial technique.

Can Jue also had a river behind him, but it was a nether river that was connected with the eighteen levels of hell and countless ghosts howling within them.

“That’s the Nether River Blade!”

“One heavenly river, and one nether river. The two martial techniques go a long way back, and there is a legend that they would become a divine cultivation technique if they merged.”

“Can Jue and Mu Qianxue are both peerless geniuses, so how can they not have some strength?”

“Lin Yun is too confident in himself.” The surrounding cultivators commented. As the battle became more exciting, they could learn something from observing the fight. This instantly made everyone excited.

Lin Yun repeated what he did and used divine runes to manifest a dragon’s claw to attack Mu Qianxue and Can Jue. Under the combination of the sword and blade, the dragon’s claw only lasted for a brief moment before it was torn apart.

“Carry on with your arrogance!” Jiang Ziyao smiled.

The faces of the other cultivators changed, and they felt that Lin Yun had overestimated himself. He had lost the initiative in his fight, and couldn’t even use his sword under Mu Qianxue and Can Jue’s attacks. A mistake in a battle between experts would be dangerous.

Not only did Lin Yun make a mistake, but his mistake was fatal, allowing Mu Qianxue and Can Jue’s blade and sword to combine.

“I was still wondering what other abilities you had...” Qin Yun sneered. Even if he fought with his eyes closed, he wouldn’t make such a beginner mistake.

Lin Yun seemed stunned before he smiled and pushed his hands forth, unleashing a sword vibration as half an inch of sword ray flew out from his chest. The sword ray was so dazzling that it made everyone close their eyes. With just half an inch of sword ray, Mu Qianxue and Can Jue couldn’t take another step further.

Lin Yun’s sword aura was fully unleashed, and his aura rose, causing heaven and earth to become dark. This also forced Mu Qianxue and Can Jue to split when they fused their sword and blade.

The Flower Burial Sword hovered beside Lin Yun, but he had no intention of grabbing it. He smiled, “If you don’t mind the two of you fusing your sword and blade, it’s best to save more energy for the last round.”

Mu Qianxue and Can Jue exchanged a gaze before they charged at Lin Yun once more, executing the Heavenly River Sword and Nether River Sword. When the heavenly river and nether river intertwined, the phenomenon they created looked like an apocalypse.

Lin Yun merely executed the Divine Sunchasing Art to dodge their attacks with no intention of reaching for his sword. But a golden lotus had appeared behind him. It was the flower representing Sword Dao. Not only were Mu Qianxue and Can Jue unable to defeat Lin Yun, but they couldn’t even touch the corner of his clothes.

“Is it my turn now?” Lin Yun smiled.

This made Mu Qianxue and Can Jue shocked as they recalled that it had been ten moves without them knowing it. But before they could do anything, Lin Yun reached out to grab onto the Flower Burial Sword. When they saw Lin Yun holding onto the sword, they suddenly sensed danger approaching, and retreated without hesitation.

“You guys think you can run?” Lin Yun smiled as he swung his sword. The two golden lotuses combined as the Azure Dragon Sword Domain was deployed, and the two sword canons circulated. Even Lin Yun couldn’t imagine how powerful this sword was, and he only used one sword to destroy the heavenly river and nether river behind Can Jue and Mu Qianxue.

Mu Qianxue and Can Jue threw out mouthfuls of blood with disbelief on their faces. But that wasn’t all, a river appeared behind Lin Yun that looked like it had traveled through space-time.

With a laugh, Lin Yun unleashed the full power of the Divine Firefly Sword and the world became filled with his afterimages, unleashing sword rays. This didn’t look like a sword technique in the mortal world, leaving everyone dumbfounded.

“It’s that sword again!” Everyone in the surroundings could feel their blood boiling as Lin Yun used this sword to defeat the Blood Conceal King. When the sword ray exploded, Can Jue and Mu Qianxue fell to the ground with ugly faces. They were covered in blood, and their bodies were filled with Lin Yun’s sword intent.

“What sword technique is that?” Mu Qianxue asked. He had a speculation, but he didn’t dare to believe it.

“Firefly. The firefly’s light can compete with the sun and moon,” Lin Yun said indifferently.

Mu Qianxue squinted, and he bitterly smiled, “So, it’s really the Divine Firefly Sword. When I looked at this sword technique in the past, everyone in the sect told me it was a weak sword technique from the Kunlun Realm.”

Can Jue suddenly said, “I give...”

But before he could finish his sentence, Lin Yun unleashed two sword rays, cutting off Can Jue’s arms from his shoulders with blood gushing out. This sent Can Jue flying away and screaming out in pain.

“We can chat but don’t even think about giving up. Since I said that I’ll cripple your arms, I’ll keep my promise. So why didn’t you believe me?” Lin Yun smiled.

Mu Qianxue was terrified and left dumbfounded by this scene. When he looked at Lin Yun again, he opened his mouth, but he couldn’t say a word.

“You want to give up as well?” Lin Yun smiled, looking at Mu Qianxue with an ‘amicable’ look. But his look made Mu Qianxue tremble, and he couldn’t say a word.
