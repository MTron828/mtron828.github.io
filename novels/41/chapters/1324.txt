Chapter 1325 - Lover

Lin Yun’s expression was gentle as he removed the veil from Luo Hua’s face, revealing her breathtaking yet familiar face before him. Looking at her, Lin Yun couldn’t contain the feelings in his heart and said in a trembling tone, “Ziyao, it has been a long time!”

It turned out that Luo Hua had been Su Ziyao all along, and Lin Yun began to recall every single word she told him while she took on the identity of Luo Hua. Back then, she said half of the reason was for the Sword Saint Mountain and didn’t talk about the other half. The other half was naturally because of him.

“Actually, I don’t like to play the zither, but I like to play it together with you…”

“I don’t like the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, but I only wish to stay here with you; I don’t wish to reason with others, but I’m willing to lower my head for you.”

“I don’t like to drink, but I like to see you when you drink. I’m a tacky person who doesn’t know music, doesn’t like fleeting clouds, and is unreasonable. But I like you, and alcohol isn’t that hateful together with you…”

Lin Yun already knew who she was long ago, but he had just been keeping it quiet. He knew that Su Ziyao had a knot in her heart. She was angry at him, so she wasn’t willing to take off her veil. But right at this moment, all of it was undone under that music, and they already knew each other’s minds.

Looking at Lin Yun, Su Ziyao had a noble temperament that made her seem cold under the snow. But this also made her rosy lips even more enchanting in this situation.

“Can I kiss you?” Lin Yun couldn’t help asking.

When Su Ziyao heard that, she couldn’t help blushing before she glared at Lin Yun and threatened, “You dare!”

But the moment she was done, Lin Yun took her in his embrace and gave her a kiss, not even giving her the chance to refuse him. This made Su Ziyao panic and struggle, but Lin Yun showed no signs of letting her go

Gradually, Su Ziyao calmed down but her face had turned red. The sweet taste across her tongue spread throughout her body, and this instantly made her body become heated.

This was a long kiss, and this nearly made the crowd draw their blades at Lin Yun. This was simply too arrogant, and Flower Burial had not placed geniuses like them in his heart at all. Lei Jue and Xuan Ying had just left, and he was kissing in front of so many people right now.

They were all breath-taken by Su Ziyao’s beauty when she revealed her appearance, and they could all feel their hearts beating wildly. But before they could exclaim at her beauty, Lin Yun had publicly kissed her, as if he was declaring that she was his wife. One could imagine how everyone there was feeling right now.

“Damn it, I’m so jealous!”

“It makes no sense! Not only is he so good-looking, he’s also so strong at the same time!”

“This Flower Burial is really arrogant!”

“Duh? He’s the strongest champion of the Heavenly Paths!” Everyone could only enviously look at Lin Yun.

“Junior Brother, you’re simply the model of our generation!” Feng Zhang and Liu Qingyan both exclaimed beside Jiang Lichen. At this moment, they were filled with respect for Lin Yun. If Lei Jue or Xuan Ying knew what Lin Yun was doing right now, they would probably throw out a mouthful of blood.

“You! You’re not allowed to do that again!” Su Ziyao looked at Lin Yun, and her tone was filled with an empress’ prestige. But her face had blushed red, which was a huge contrast to the prestige that she was giving off. For some reason, this actually made her look adorable.

“Sorry about that, wifey. I won’t do it again,” smiled Lin Yun.

Hearing what Lin Yun said, Su Ziyao’s face turned red, and replied, “Who’s your wifey? Stop being loquacious!”

“Su Ziyao is my wife.” Lin Yun winked before pinching Su Ziyao’s cheeks with a pleasing smile.

“Cut that out!” Su Ziyao glared at Lin Yun.

“Haha. Alright, alright.” Lin Yun smiled, then gave Su Ziyao another kiss before she could even respond.

Su Ziyao was briefly caught by surprise and hammered Lin Yun on his back. But her struggle gradually died down and she hooked onto Lin Yun’s neck instead, giving him a passionate response. When they split up, Lin Yun had traces of blood dripping from his lips.

Rubbing the blood off his lips, Lin Yun smiled. “Are you trying to kill your husband?”

“I won’t.” Su Ziyao replied bashfully.

“Don’t worry. I know, and I can teach you.” Lin Yun smiled. But the moment he spoke, he knew that he had made a mistake in his words.

When Su Ziyao heard that, she wore a playful smile and looked at Lin Yun. “Oh? So who did you learn it from?”

When she spoke, she even pinched Lin Yun on his neck. The pain made the corner of Lin Yun’s lip twitch and he smiled awkwardly, “It’s a misunderstanding. It’s all a misunderstanding.”

“Hmph. I’ll let you off, for now!” Su Ziyao let go of Lin Yun before putting her veil back on.

Lin Yun looked at Su Ziyao. The two had interacted for half a month. Aside from the beginning when Lin Yun hadn’t guessed her identity, he knew about her identity most of the time.

“Ziyao, you’re really beautiful.” Lin Yun said after staring at Su Ziyao for a long time.

“So you’re saying that I was not beautiful in the past?”

“You’re beautiful when you smile.” Lin Yun changed the topic.

When Su Ziyao was about to place her veil on, she gave a gentle smile to Lin Yun. Su Ziyao was cold, and she would rarely reveal any emotions to others. But her smile was so warm that it could even melt snow. Before he could have enough of her smile, her face was already covered by the veil.

“Your identity is already revealed, so you should explain yourself to Ye Ziling.” Su Ziyao’s voice resounded. “She’s a good lady, so you’re not allowed to hurt her. Since you’re the cause, resolve it yourself.”

After more than a month of interaction on the Profound Wither Island, Su Ziyao had changed her impression of Ye Ziling. As the two of them had deeper interactions, they realized that there were characteristics of each other that attracted them like old friends. So Su Ziyao became serious when it came to protecting Ye Ziling.

“Why don’t I take her in, then?” Lin Yun joked. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Why don’t you try?” Su Ziyao threw a playful gaze at Lin Yun, making him feel a chill down his spine.

As the two descended from the sky, they arrived before Ye Ziling and the rest. When Lin Yun looked at Ye Ziling, his face was stiff as he wore an awkward smile. “I’m sorry about that.”

Truth be told, he didn’t have to apologize because he didn’t give Ye Ziling any promise, and they were purely just friends. It just so turned out that Flower Burial was the one she liked.

With a calm smile, Ye Ziling replied, “The one I like is Flower Burial, and it has nothing to do with Lin Yun. So you don’t have to apologize to me. If you want, you can congratulate me for refining an origin saint rune.”

Earlier, there was a moment when her heart broke into pieces when Lin Yun removed his mask. But it was only for that split second. She already had a feeling that Flower Burial might just be her life’s dream. If it was possible, she didn’t want to wake up from the dream.

.

Her feelings were true, and it was also true that she was fond of Flower Burial. The full moon that Flower Burial appeared had captivated her heart. But when Flower Burial removed his mask, her dream shattered into pieces. On the other hand, it made her feel more realistic, understanding that this wasn’t a dream. He came into her life before, and she fell for him before. To Ye Ziling, that was already enough for her.

Lin Yun was briefly stunned before he recovered from his shock. When they looked at each other, they wore faint smiles on their faces.

“Congratulations!” Lin Yun reached his hand out and shook hands with Ye Ziling. It was just like what they previously said, not all ‘likes’ were the same, and the two have always been friends.

“You’re not allowed to bully Big Sister Su in the future or I’ll beat you up.” Ye Ziling looked at Lin Yun seriously. “I’m really strong now.”

She possessed the Divine Dragon Sword Physique and Radiant Snow Bloodline. Now that she had refined an origin saint rune and engraved it on her elysium core, even those fated transcendents might not be her opponent if they fought for real.

“There’s no way I can bully her. I’ll be happy if she doesn’t bully me. So you have to stand on my side.” Lin Yun smiled helplessly.

“Hmph, just who had a smug look on his face earlier and bullied Big Sister Su?” Ye Ziling glared at Lin Yun.

When Lin Yun heard that, his expression immediately became awkward. He was caught red-handed, so he couldn’t refute her words.

“Senior Sister, the Sword Sect is here.” Liu Qingyan suddenly spoke up when he saw Mu Qingqing coming over with a group of Sword Sect disciples.

Aside from them, there was also a group of women from the Heavenly Note Sect. For two powerful sects to appear at the same time, it was a huge formation, and Lin Yun instantly understood why Lei Jue and Xuan Ying retreated so decisively.
