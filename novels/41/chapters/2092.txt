Chapter 2093 - Zhao Tianyu

Lin Yun wasn’t surprised by this scene and exerted more force, sending Yellowclothed Venerable flying away.

Blood dripped down the Yellowclothed Venerable’s his lips while being sent flying away. He exclaimed in shock, “How is this possible?!”

After sending the Yellowclothed Venerably flying away, Lin Yun had no intentions of staying behind and sheathed his sword before leaving.

“You want to leave after severing my arm?!” A roar echoed before Bloodclothed Venerable caught up with Lin Yun after he had only ran for ten-odd miles. Crimson pollen spread out from her, and anyone could tell that the pollen was poisonous at first glance because the grass withered when it came in contact with the pollen. At the same time, Yellowclothed Venerable also caught up.Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“You two are getting on my nerves!” Murderous intent gushed out of Lin Yun’s eyes, before he swung his sword down at Bloodclothed Venerable, “Flowing Time!”

With a roar, a waterfall descended from the sky. This shocked Bloodclothed Venerable into focusing on defence while blooming her saint dao.

But Lin Yun was using the twelfth sword form of the Divine Firefly Sword, so how could it be blocked with ordinary saint dao? His sword ray crushed the crimson saint dao and sent Bloodclothed Venerable flying away.

“A genius swordsman.” The blood-clothed youth’s eyes flickered when he saw this scene, but he had no intentions of making a move. If he could use this person, he could be a pawn to be used against Ye Qingtian. He did not understand Ye Qingtian, so he didn’t connect this person with him. He only felt that this mysterious person must be a golden generation genius who possessed the Dragon Clan’s bloodline and was a genius swordsman.

“Let’s test his strength, first.” The Divine Son soared to the sky with lightning gathering on him. As purple light flashed within his pupils, it looked like all the lightning in the world was being manipulated by him, with a suffocating pressure crashing down on Lin Yun.

That was the aura of greater dao, and this shocked Lin Yun because the pressure of greater dao was on a whole new level than the two Venerables. When Lin Yun turned around, he saw lightning manifesting into a finger that was descending from the sky.

The finger was like a stone pillar and a sword that was rapidly descending from the sky. This instantly made Lin Yun wonder if this person was the Blood Moon Divine Son. This instantly put a grave expression on Lin Yun’s face. He knew that it would be hard to withstand this attack unless he brought out the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella or dual sword stars. But he couldn’t reveal them yet, and he wasn’t exactly out of means because he still had the last sword form of the Divine Firefly Sword.

Gritting his teeth, Lin Yun recalled what was written on Yu Qingfeng’s notes.

“He’s somewhat lacking…” The Blood Moon Divine Son looked disappointed. Apparently he had overestimated this person. With a glance, he could tell that this mysterious person couldn’t withstand this attack even if he possessed a powerful Astral Sword Intent. The only thing he could do was barely protect himself. But this person didn’t possess a powerful Astral Sword Intent, since he would have brought it out long ago if he did.

But just when Lin Yun was about to be torn apart by that lightning finger, he thrusted his sword at the lightning finger. When the two clashed, all of the surrounding withered plants come to life with boundless life force pouring into Lin Yun’s body.

Everything seemed to have manifested into sword aura that was pouring into Lin Yun’s sword. As a powerful sword aura swept out, the runes on the surface of the lightning finger began to crumble.

“Hmph!” The Blood Moon Divine Son felt provoked and waved his hand, unleashing his greater dao once more. This caused the ground that Lin Yun was standing on to crumble, with a huge crater appearing.

When the Blood Moon Divine Son landed at the crater's edge, the two injured Venerables gathered over. Bloodclothed Venerable licked her lips, and said, “What a pity for such a genius to die before he could even rise.”

Yellowclothed Venerable said, “He’s unlucky to run into the Divine Son. Everything is nothing before the power of a greater dao.”

Lin Yun was hiding in the crater and was using the Silvermoon Mask to conceal his aura. Thus, the two venerables weren’t able to find him.

It’s really the Blood Moon Divine Son. So he’s the one Wang Muyan met tonight? It’s more or less the same as what I’ve speculated. She might’ve already noticed that Bai Xiao was keeping an eye on her, so she used this opportunity to get rid of him. Lin Yun inwardly muttered.

“Go down and look for him,” the Blood Moon Divine Son gave the order.

The two Venerables jumped into the crater and searched, but they couldn’t find any traces of the mysterious person anywhere. The Silvermoon Mask and Divine Tortoise Transformation could conceal Lin Yun’s aura. Not only that, Lin Yun was also covered in dust and would look like a stone to an outsider.

While the two Venerables tried to search for Lin Yun, they had passed by him several times, but they failed to discover him. Bloodclothed Venerable frowned, “Divine Son, can it be that he ran away? There are some blood traces, but we can’t find his corpse anywhere.”

“How can he possibly escape? He must’ve been crushed to death by the power of greater dao,” the Yellowclothed Venerable said.

“Are you two blind to not notice someone so obvious? Your method of concealing yourself is interesting. Can you teach it to me…?” The Blood Moon Divine Son smiled, and his words shocked the two Venerables.

“As expected of the Blood Moon Divine Son.” Lin Yun looked awkward because he thought no one could detect him. When he reappeared, the two Venerables were shocked because they wouldn’t have been able to put up any resistance if this guy wanted to take their lives earlier.

“I wouldn’t have been able to detect you without the Indigo Lightning Eyes. You’ve practically concealed all your life force, so it’s hard for anyone to detect you unless it’s a Saint Realm expert,” the Blood Moon Divine Son said.

“I see…” Lin Yun replied.

The Blood Moon Divine Son admired Lin Yun’s temperament, so he said with a smile, “The Blood Moon Sect will sweep throughout Kunlun once again. Your talent has caught my attention. Are you interested in raising the sacred flame together with us? I need a genius swordsman, and I can give you anything you want as long as you nod your head.”

“Oh? Who are you planning to deal with?” Lin Yun looked interested.

“Eastern Desolation’s Ye Qingtian. You’ve heard of him, right? As long as you join forces with me, I can help you seize his fortune, and everything belonging to him will belong to you,” the Blood Moon Divine Son said with his eyes shining brightly. His voice sounded magnetic and charming, which could draw others into his words if they weren’t careful, which was similar to Wang Muyan's ability.

Lin Yun did not react, but he was inwardly shocked. The Blood Moon Divine Son wanted to deal with him? But he didn’t know what to say at this moment.

Seeing Lin Yun wasn’t saying anything, the Blood Moon Divine Son added more to the stake. He smiled, “I heard that there’s someone even stronger than Ye Qingtian. If I remember correctly, he’s called Flower Burial. If you’re willing to join hands with me, we can make them both history, and you can enjoy all the saint dao fortune on the Blue Dragon Record!”

Lin Yun was speechless because both Ye Qingtian and Flower Burial were him. Lin Yun smiled, “Don’t you want to see who I am beneath my mask?”

“No need. I don’t care who you are, and I don’t need to know your identity as long as you’re willing to join hands with me. Your cultivation is still lacking, so you can’t get a spot on the Blue Dragon Record,” the Blood Moon Divine Son smiled. He sounded confident and sincere.

If it was someone else, they would probably agree with the Blood Moon Divine Son without a second thought, and those who felt that they were smart might even take this opportunity to use the Blood Moon Divine Son. But they would fall deep into the abyss the moment they agreed, and it was just a matter of time before they were reduced to a chess piece of the Blood Moon Divine Son.

But it was a pity that Ye Qingtian and Flower Burial were both Lin Yun. So no matter how tempting the offer was, Lin Yun only found it hilarious. He smiled, “Don’t you think it’s ridiculous for us to cooperate when we were after each other’s necks earlier?”

The Blood Moon Divine Son smiled, “What’s ridiculous about it? There’s no eternal feud as long as there are common interests. Even if you become my enemy in the future, I’ll submit to you as long as you’re stronger than me.”

“Then wait for an opportunity to kill me?” Lin Yun asked with a playful smile.

The Blood Moon Divine Son didn’t seem bothered, and he smiled even brighter, “Is that bad? After all, life needs to be exciting. Having a viper by your side is better than having a dog, right?”

Lin Yun opened his mouth beneath the mask. He had to admit that the Blood Moon Divine Son was a ruthless person, ruthless to himself and his enemies.

“You’ve almost recovered from your injuries, so it’s time for you to decide,” the Blood Moon Divine Son squinted. He already discovered that this mysterious person was purposely dragging time to recover from his injuries, but he didn’t seem bothered because the Blood Moon Divine Son was confident in his strength.

“I don’t like to keep vipers, and I only like cats,” Lin Yun said.

“Mhm?” The Blood Moon Divine Son frowned. He abruptly thought of something and turned around to see that Bai Xiao had disappeared.

“You should leave. Don’t even think about killing me because you won’t be able to leave if you don’t leave now,” Lin Yun said.

Right then, a group flew over from the Heavenly Dao Sect’s direction. They were all radiating a saint aura. They were all Quasi-Saints, and the party leader gave off a blazing aura that looked like a bright sun. The Heavenly Dao Sect’s Golden Guards have arrived.

“Zhao Tianyu, who gave you the guts to act wantonly in the territory of my Heavenly Dao Sect?!” The white-clothed youth leading the party roared as he shone with a dazzling radiance that swept all the darkness away.

The blood-clothed youth was Zhao Tianyu, the Divine Son of the Blood Moon Sect.

“Bai Clan’s baby? You can’t even enter the God Burial Mountain Range, and yet you dare reprimand me? Even the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden doesn’t dare to act so presumptuously before me,” Zhao Tianyu smiled.

Lin Yun initially thought that this person was Bai Shuying. But after realizing that this person was a young man, he instantly figured that this must be the other golden-generation genius of the Bai Clan.
