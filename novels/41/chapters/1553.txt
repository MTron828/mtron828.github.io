Chapter 1554 - Forest Encounter (2)

Over the past fifteen days, Lin Yun practiced the Carefree 9 Swords without any rest, using demonic beasts to temper his sword technique. The Heaven, Earth, Profound, and Barren Sword Forms became increasingly proficient in his hands, and he could control them as he wished.

This was a profound feeling, as if he had a sixth sense that fused with the Carefree 9 Swords. Lin Yun felt this might be related to the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent.

After the sword intent reaches the fifth grade, he could foresee dangers. After all, his sword intent would merge into heaven and earth, which meant that his sixth sense would alarm him if there were any dangers.

This meant that his sword intent would sense it beforehand, and the sword in his hand would make the corresponding defense.

It was just that the demonic beasts at the border of the mountain range were too weak. The Elysium Core Realm demonic beasts couldn’t threaten him, aside from monarch nine-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm demonic beasts.

Since there weren’t any opponents who could threaten him, he could easily slay the overlord demonic beasts. Out of the Heaven, Earth, Profound, and Barren Sword Forms, he only needed to use the Heaven and Earth Sword Forms to deal with those demonic beasts. At most, he would finish the battle with another Flicking Divine Finger.

Monarch demonic beasts were rare, to begin with. Powerful demonic beasts were generally intelligent and would escape when they felt that their life was threatened. Based on Lin Yun’s current strength, he would only waste time by chasing after them. So he was naturally unmotivated to chase after them.

“It looks like I have to go into the region with Dragon Pulse Realm demonic beasts…” Lin Yun muttered while wiping the blood off of the Flower Burial Sword. In front of him were countless corpses of Elysium Core Realm demonic beasts, with their blood forming into a river.

“Aren’t you too inflated? How can demonic beasts be compared to humans? Demonic beasts can generally condense dragon origin once they step into the Dragon Pulse Realm.” Lil’ Purple warned from the sword box.

“Let’s give it a try, then.” Lin Yun sheathed his sword and left this region.

Roughly half a day later, when Lin Yun came to the region where Dragon Pulse Realm demonic beasts could be found, he sensed that the demonic aura in the atmosphere was a lot denser than in the previous region.

It didn’t take long for him to run into a poisonous python that was a hundred feet long. It had a horn on its head, was covered in black scales and a pair of purple pupils.

This was an Indigocloud Demonic Python with cloud patterns covering its back. The cloud patterns could release a form of poison that could draw its prey into an illusion. As for its pupils, they could shoot out corrosive demonic lights. This made the Indigocloud Demonic Python a terrifying first-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm opponent.

Even if it ran into an overlord demonic beast at the nine-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm, it could kill its opponent in one exchange. Not to mention that Lin Yun had cultivated the Azure Dragon Saint Art, which meant that he had a raging vitality that had a fatal attraction to any demonic beast.

Even with the Black Tortoise Breathing, Lin Yun couldn’t conceal his raging vitality. Demonic beasts didn’t even have to look at him for them to notice his raging vitality. They just needed a gentle whiff.

As the colossal python began to slither into the forest, from afar, it looked like a long cloth that was shuttling through the woods.

“What speed!” Lin Yun was surprised by the speed of the Indigocloud Demonic Python as it shuttled through the forest like a bolt of lightning. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

It didn’t take long for Lin Yun to be surrounded by a poisonous mist, and it couldn’t be avoided. This poison was extremely terrifying since the toxin could penetrate the skin, and not even astral energy could stop it. The moment one was caught in the poison, they would fall into an illusion, which meant they wouldn’t be far from death.

Seeing that he couldn’t stop the poisonous mist from approaching, Lin Yun gave up trying and allowed the toxin to enter his body before circulating the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra to devour the toxin. Under the corrosive traits of the nether energy, Lin Yun easily got rid of the toxin that was within his body.

Suddenly, trees began collapsing as two demonic indigo lights shot out from the mist.

Lin Yun swiftly responded by executing the Divine Sunchasing Art, moving half an inch to the side as the two demonic beams brushed by him. After he avoided the two demonic beams, a gigantic figure approached. The Indigocloud Demonic Python had gotten close to him.

It might seem agile, but its body was filled with power. It opened its jaws, wanting to devour Lin Yun whole. Lin Yun couldn’t see anything since the python was too fast, but he could feel a powerful suction force coming from a crimson hole that was trying to draw him.

Without any hesitation, Lin Yun executed the Heaven Sword Form, relying on the sword aura to resist the suction force, and retreated. Simultaneously, one shadowy sword ray after another flew out from his body, intertwining like brush strokes.

When the Indigocloud Demonic Python closed its jaw, Lin Yun pushed his palm out and the ancient ‘heaven’ word that was written with sword rays flew out. When the ancient ‘heaven’ word came in contact with the Indigocloud Demonic Python, the python was sent flying back.

Not allowing the Indigocloud Demonic Python to recover, more shadows flew out from Lin Yun, executing the Earth Sword Form. Whenever a sword ray flew out, the surrounding gravity would increase. By the time Lin Yun landed on the ground, the surrounding gravity had been raised by seventy-two-fold.

When the gravity pressed down on the Indigocloud Demonic Python, the python was stuck to the ground, and the immense gravity was like a rope tying the python to the ground.

As the ancient ‘earth’ word hovered before Lin Yun, space slowly distorted as it revolved. This put the python in even more pain. It could only helplessly roar, unable to do anything else, no matter how it struggled.

Suddenly, a black crimson light flickered within its pupils before a purple light exploded from its body, causing cracks to appear on the ancient ‘earth’ word that was hovering before Lin Yun. When the Indigocloud Demonic Python broke free of Lin Yun’s control, it didn’t hesitate to turn and shuttle into the forest like a bolt of lightning, swiftly disappearing from Lin Yun’s sight.

“This Indigocloud Demonic Python is really violent in controlling its dragon origin.” Lin Yun muttered with his eyes squinted. It was a slight headache because the Indigocloud Demonic Python had unleashed its dragon origin in the last moment on itself to break free.

When the Indigocloud Demonic Python thought it was safe, a skinny black figure suddenly appeared. That black figure swiftly expanded in size and reached out before slamming the python down on the ground by its neck.

When the python was slammed onto the ground, its skull was shattered in a split second. That black figure was naturally Lil’ Red in its Ancient Dracoape form. As Lil’ Red swayed its body, it returned to its cat form and ran over to Lin Yun.

The two had a great rapport and worked together countless times. Whenever Lin Yun was too lazy to deal with the demonic beasts, he would leave it to Lil’ Red.

It didn’t take long for Lil’ Red to land on Lin Yun’s shoulder. Just when Lin Yun was about to leave, he suddenly stopped and raised his head. He could sense a pair of eyes were directed at him.

When Lin Yun glanced at the direction he felt the gaze from, he instantly recalled a familiar sensation. It was the monarch demonic beast, the Demonic Rune Tiger, that he had met in the past.

This Demonic Rune Tiger grasped the demon clan’s cultivation technique. Thus, it was able to speak the human language. It had been half a year since they last met, and the Demonic Rune Tiger had probably reached the Dragon Pulse Realm by now.

When the Demonic Rune Tiger noticed Lin Yun raising his head, it disappeared into the darkness with a leap. But Lin Yun didn’t let it go that easily. He quickly chased after the tiger. After all, he was curious about the cultivation technique that the Demonic Rune Tiger had grasped.
