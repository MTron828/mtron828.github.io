Chapter 509 - Unconvinced? More Beating!

There wasn’t any issue in Lin Yun’s words, but the provocation in his tone left everyone shocked. No one expected that Lin Yun was bold enough to challenge Mo Feng.

Mo Feng was stunned and then sneered, “If you want to convince others, then you’ll have to speak with your strength. After all, it’s useless to have someone boast on your behalf.”

Many elders nodded their heads when they heard his words. In the world of cultivators, you spoke with your fists. Hence, only the strong could stand out. Even the elder seated at the center, Tang Yu, didn’t oppose the suggestion.

Seeing that no one rejected his suggestion, Mo Feng’s confidence boosted as he smiled, “Don’t say that I’m bullying you. The guest deacon’s position will go to whoever wins. If you lose, then scram to where you came from. Don’t let me see you again.”

Mo Feng’s words left many elders shocked, but they weren’t surprised since Mo Feng came from the Mo Clan, not to mention that he was recommended by Mo Ling. So he was naturally unhappy that a youth from the Great Qin Empire came to compete for the guest deacon position. It was only natural that he flared up when he saw Lin Yun today.

“I agree.”

“There are also similar examples in the past where two disciples made a recommendation and we decided it with a battle.”

“That’s right. You can’t blame anyone if you’re too weak. After all, our academy will be the one who gets humiliated if you’re too weak.” The various elders all nodded their heads. Even Elder Yu, who was also seated among the elders, wore a helpless expression. She knew that there was no way Lin Yun, who came from the Great Qin Empire, could defeat an elite from the Mo Clan, not to mention that there was a huge gap between their cultivation.

“Yunyan, what do you think?” Tang Yu looked at Liu Yunyan.

“Lin Yun’s opinion is my opinion,” replied Liu Yunyan.

“Mo Ling, what do you think?” Tang Yu turned to look at Mo Ling.

“I also wish to hear what he’ll say. If he can offer the position, I’m willing to compensate him. But if they fight, my cousin might not be able to restrain himself well. It won’t be good if he injures this lad here,” replied Mo Ling. She naturally felt that Lin Yun would lose for sure.

With that, everyone turned to look at Lin Yun. Mo Ling had already taken a step back. After all, there was a huge chance that Lin Yun would lose in their view, so Mo Ling had already taken a step back by making compensation if Lin Yun was willing to back out.

“Back out? I’m sorry, but I might not even lose the fight even if I’m fighting you personally, not to mention your cousin. On the other hand, I’m looking forward to looking at your cousin’s strength,” said Lin Yun as a chilling aura started to emit from his body.

For a split second, all the elders were shocked by Lin Yun’s arrogance. Even Liu Yunyan’s face had changed because challenging Mo Ling wasn’t a wise choice.

“What arrogance. Since that’s the case, then we’ll fulfil your wish. Mo Feng, don’t embarrass me,” replied Mo Ling as a chilling aura also emitted from her.

“Hehe, don’t worry about it. I’ll make him regret his words,” replied Mo Feng with a disdainful sneer on his face. He clearly didn’t consider Lin Yun an opponent.

The two came to the empty ground before the Imperial Study Hall. Even the surrounding disciples also stopped to watch. After all, it was rare to watch a battle in front of the Imperial Study Hall.

“I’ve seen many cultivators from small places in the Nether Prefectural City. They’re as arrogant as you, but in the end, all of them were taught a lesson. The gap between our foundation is larger than you think,” replied Mo Feng.

The gap in our foundation? Lin Yun sneered inwardly. That was true for ordinary people, but Lin Yun was someone who cultivated an ancient sword sutra. So there was no way Mo Feng’s foundation could compare to his.

“Since the two of you have made a decision, then I hereby announce that the winner will obtain the guest deacon position, enjoying the treatment of an inner disciple,” announced Tang Yu.

Lin Yun took a step forward and his violet palace began to ripple. At the same time, a boundless aura emitted out from him that was a lot stronger than when he was in the quasi-Violet Palace Realm.

“Mo Clan’s Star Breaking Fist!” Mo Feng’s eyes flashed coldly when he sensed Lin Yun’s aura. He threw out a punch that traveled like a bolt of lightning. It practically took a split second for his fist to arrive before Lin Yun. The origin energy contained in the punch was so powerful that it seemed as if it could shatter a star.

What speed! Truth be told, Mo Feng was stronger than Pan Yue and Han Fei. This meant that the Mo Clan did have a deep foundation and an ordinary lesser Yin stage cultivator would probably be defeated by this punch. But it was a pity that he ran into Lin Yun.

As the fist continued to grow in Lin Yun’s vision, Lin Yun clenched his fist and flames from the Dracophant Seal began to spread out on the surface of his body. At the same time, a violent aura began to boil like flames in his blood.

When the seal covered his entire body, Lin Yun threw a punch out. When he threw his punch, it was accompanied by the roar of a dracophant. Right at this moment, Lin Yun looked like the manifestation of an ancient beast.

When the two fists collided, Mo Feng’s lips twitched with pain. He was shocked by the strength behind Lin Yun’s punch. A second later, Mo Feng was forced to take a few steps back with his face ugly from the pain.

“How does it feel?” sneered Lin Yun.

“What arrogance. I was just careless. Again!” Mo Feng was clearly unconvinced as he soared into the sky and pounced at Lin Yun like a bolt of lightning. In just one breath, he actually threw out over ninety punches. The aura coming from his punches felt suffocating to others.

Unconvinced? Again it is! Lin Yun smiled as he began to form seals with his fingers. As he poured origin energy into his hands, his fingers began to glow along with a domineering aura. One after another, seals were being formed and Lin Yun’s aura also started to grow even more terrifying.

When Lin Yun combined the four seals together, the torrential aura coming from Lin Yun was shocking. Even Mo Feng’s face had changed as he poured all his origin energy into his punches.

“Star Breaking Fist–Astral Descend!” A blazing heat swept out from Mo Feng’s punches.

Lin Yun had no changes to his face as he also threw out another punch. When they clashed, the entire ground began to tremble. No one had expected such a ferocious collision between the two. As the two continued to clash, the aura emitting from them grew even more terrifying. Some of the elders were even hesitating if they should stop the fight.

Suddenly, a silvery light exploded and Mo Feng fell onto the ground as he threw up a mouthful of blood. His face had turned pale from the attack.

“Are you convinced now?” asked Lin Yun.

“You’re courting death!” Mo Feng no longer held back as he unleashed all his aura. In the next second, the clouds began to church with bolts of lightning flashing across them.

“Great!” Lin Yun smiled as he charged forward. The two clashed in the sky head-on. In the blink of an eye, the two of them had already exchanged over a few hundred punches. As for the spectators, they could only hear the booming collision from their punches. After ten-odd punches later, a figure was sent flying out. That person kneeled on the ground and vomited blood.

When everyone identified that person, their faces changed drastically. Mo Feng had lost another exchange. This was the third time Mo Feng lost in the head-on collision. Many of the elders who previously supported Mo Feng wore an ugly expression. As for Mo Ling, her face had turned ugly long ago.

“Damn it. I don’t believe I can’t defeat you!” Mo Feng couldn’t accept his continual defeat. He was the direct descendant of the Mo Clan, but he couldn’t even defeat a piece of trash from the Great Qin Empire?

“That’s enough!” barked Lin Yun. At the same time, a sword buzz rang out from his body as he unleashed his xiantian sword intent. His boundless sword intent instantly sent Mo Feng flying out once more.

“Xiantian sword intent!” Many elders were shocked by this scene. Even Mo Ling;s mouth widened in shock. Only Liu Yunyan wore a faint smile on her lips.

Looking at Mo Feng struggling to get back on his feet, Lin Yun spoke out coldly, “You wouldn’t even be able to take three of my moves if I used my xiantian sword intent right from the beginning. I have already given you enough face. If you insist on being stubborn, then don’t blame me for being impolite.”

Damn it! Lin Yun’s words were like a dagger that stabbed into Mo Feng’s chest, humiliating him. After a long while later, Mo Feng gnashed his teeth, “I lost.”

“Get lost then. Remember you promise. As you said, don’t ever let me see you again,” replied Lin Yun as he dismissed his xiantian sword intent.

Upon hearing that, both Mo Ling and Mo Feng’s faces turned dark.
