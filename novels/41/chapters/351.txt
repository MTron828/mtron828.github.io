Chapter 352 - One Without Surname

“Greetings, Guardian Plum, Sword-Bearing Elders!” The surrounding disciples were shocked by this scene. No one had expected that Guardian Plum and the seven Sword-Bearing Elders would show up at the same time.

After a brief shock, they quickly cupped their hands together. Guardian Plum nodded his head and he looked at Lin Yun before turning to Ling Yan.

Looking at the wound on Ling Yan’s chest, Guardian Plum frowned and sent a wisp of origin energy into Ling Yan’s body to resolve Lin Yun’s sword intent.

When the sword intent dissipated, Ling Yan let out a breath and he quickly got up on his feet, “Thank you, Guardian Plum.” He soon lowered his head with shame when he thought of something.

“Ling Yan, the sect has already decided to give you the quota, so why did you still come to bother Lin Yun? Don’t you know that it’s a crime to disturb an inner disciple’s cultivation?” Guardian Plum questioned Ling Yan coldly with a stern voice.

“I don’t need the quota. Please issue your punishment.” Ling Yan was too ashamed to accept the quota since he was defeated. He only wanted to leave this place right now.

“Take him away.” Guardian Plum waved his hand and got the Sword-Bearing Elders to bring Ling Yan away. Ling Yan wasn’t the focus now.

Guardian Plum turned to Lin Yun and smiled, “Since Ling Yan withdrew willingly, then you can have the quota. Lin Yun, are you willing to represent the Sword Firmament Pavilion in the Demonlotus Realm?”

Aside from Demonlotus Cores, there were many treasures that could be found in the Demonlotus Realm. The treasures could greatly boost the sect’s foundation and the Sword Firmament Pavilion needed them.

Lin Yun did not give a reply immediately and turned to look at Xin Yan, who nodded her head.

“I won’t disappoint the Sword Firmament Pavilion,” replied Lin Yun.

Guardian Plum looked around, and he asked, “Sword-Bearing Elders, do you guys have any objections?”

“No.”

“Then this is what we will do. No one is allowed to have any more objections.” Then, Guardian Plum and the elders quickly disappeared.

Lin Yun fell into deep thought. He knew that Guardian Plum had probably noticed Ling Yan’s actions a long time ago, but he chose not to stop Ling Yan. Then again, what could be hidden from the strongest Guardian?

“How long are you guys going to stay here? This is the Locket Mountain territory!” Xin Yan looked at the surrounding spectators, sending chills down their spines. They immediately apologized and dispersed.

Then, the Locket Mountain’s disciples came forward and explained what happened. This made Tang Tong, Yan Ding, and Wang Zhen because Lin Yun defeated Ling Yan with one sword. They knew that Lin Yun was strong, but not that strong.

“I have a few words I wish to say to junior brother. You guys can go first,” said Xin Yan. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Okay, we’ll take our leave first.” They departed immediately, leaving Lin Yun and Xin Yan by themselves. The atmosphere was weird and Lin Yun was feeling uneasy. After all, Lin Yun had already given his promise to Xin Yan, which he ultimately broke.

“Senior Sister…”

“Don’t talk.” Xin Yan came over and gently wiped her finger over Lin Yun’s wound. Lin Yun’s wound then quickly closed up and disappeared. This was the power of Xin Yan’s Martial Soul.

“You were nearly disfigured.” Xin Yan smiled when she saw the wound closing up. Lin Yun also felt relieved when he saw this scene.

But just when Lin Yun’s face relaxed, Xin Yan’s face became stern, “Why didn’t you attack since you could defeat him in a move? What if you were injured?”

“But I gave you my promise,” responded Lin Yun.

“Are you stupid? Hmph, if Ling Yan wasn’t pathetic enough, I would teach him a lesson.” Xin Yan knocked on Lin Yun’s head with anger on her face. But when she thought about it again, she couldn’t help but laugh.

Lin Yun just stood there smiling. Whenever Xin Yan hit his head, it signified that she wasn’t angry anymore.

“It seems like you’re no longer weaker than me. I nearly ruined your chance to go to the Demonlotus Realm. It’s fortunate that Guardian Plum gave the quota back to you. I believe that no one will object anymore,” smiled Xin Yan. “Will you hate me if you really can’t go to the Demonlotus Realm?”

“I won’t,” said Lin Yun. “Because I have to listen to my senior sister’s words.”

“But sister sister hates herself now… Come here, I want to show you something.” Xin Yan narrowed her eyes into slits and held onto Lin Yun’s hand. Eventually, they arrived somewhere remote and barren. It was a surprising location because such a barren land actually existed in the Sword Firmament Pavilion.

Lin Yun looked at the tomb before him in confusion. The tomb had words engraved on it, “Tomb of the Great Qin Empire’s General, Ye Yuhan.”

Lin Yun began to talk, “This is…”

“This is my father’s tomb,” smiled Xin Yan. “I come here whenever I’m unhappy.”

“But the person on the tomb is surnamed Ye,” said Lin Yun.

“Senior Sister used to have Ye as her surname, but she doesn’t have a surname anymore,” replied Xin Yan, as if she was talking about something normal.

Lin Yun was shocked by her words. Then again, it made sense since ‘Xin’ didn’t seem to be a surname. But if Xin Yan used to be Ye Xinyan, why was her surname taken away from her? According to his knowledge, anyone who had their surname taken away must have committed a grave crime.

For a brief moment, Lin Yun was baffled. He never expected that Xin Yan, who was always smiling, would have such a past.

“It doesn’t matter. I’ll be able to get my surname back when Big Brother gets first in the Dragon Gate Competition at the end of this year,” smiled Xin Yan. “Dad, you dated on me and my third brother the most when we were young. Third brother passed away at a young age, but I’m happy today because I have another younger brother. But this younger brother is a little stupid and he nearly put his life at risk because of my words. He’s stupid, just like third brother…”

Xin Yan started sobbing. Then, she wiped her tears and looked at Lin Yun, “Junior Brother, you won’t blame me for taking things into my own hand and calling you my younger brother, right?”

“I won’t, just as long as you’re happy,” replied Lin Yun. He then took out a jar of monkey wine and said, “I might not have met uncle, but please rest assured. Big Sister Xin Yan has a good life in the Sword Firmament Pavilion and everyone from the Locket Mountain respects her.”

“Let’s go, we should return.” Xin Yan narrowed her eyes into slits and revealed a warm smile. When the two of them left, a person silently appeared. Xin Jue looked at the two of them with a smile on his face. He thought that Xin Yan would still be here crying.

Time gradually passed and the various sects began to move because of the Demonlotus Sect.

The Deputy-Sect Master of the Primal Origin Sect, Xiao Lengya, frowned for a long time before he said, “Elder Wen, are you sure that Lin Yun is among the ten quota in the Sword Firmament Pavilion?”

“Absolutely.” Wen Yanbo’s face was dark and he spoke coldly, “There’s no way I can get something like this wrong.”

He failed to assassinate Lin Yun and even took a palm from Luo Feng. He still hadn’t recovered from his injuries.

“The Sword Firmament Pavilion must be insane to send such a monstrous genius into the Demonlotus Realm. But, it doesn’t matter if this brat is a monster. He’s only in the seventh stage, right?”

“He’s courting death to enter the Demonlotus Realm with that cultivation. Furthermore, cosmic artifacts are forbidden in the Demonlotus Realm.”

“But what if he comes out alive?” One of the elders asked with a grave expression.

Xiao Lengya’s gaze grew cold. He looked at Wen Yanbo, “Elder Wen, adjust the quota. Kill that brat in the Demonlotus Realm if there’s an opportunity.”

“Roger,” smiled Wen Yanbo. At the same time, the Heavenly Profound Sect adjusted their quota in response to the news of Lin Yun. The goal of the various sects wasn’t just to obtain the treasures from the Demonlotus Realm, but also the Demonlotus Cores. This was a rare opportunity for the sects, so they had to take advantage of it to strengthen their foundation.
