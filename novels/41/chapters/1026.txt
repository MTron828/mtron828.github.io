Chapter 1027 - Trap

Lin Yun’s voice resounded like thunder as bolts of lightning tore apart the sky. Right now, he was standing above a pile of corpses with an unrestrained aura. Simultaneously, the crimson lightning sounded like the weeping of the war realms. It was the price they had to pay for messing with Lin Yun.

As more geniuses began to gather at Yellow Sandy Plain, they could see Lin Yun enveloped in torrential crimson light from afar. He was declaring war with the war realms by butchering the geniuses who tried to humiliate him.

But when everything began to calm down, everyone looked at Lin Yun nervously because they could sense the terrifying aura coming from the gigantic statue. The war realms clearly had something, so they didn’t care that their servants were killed.

Since they paid such a great price to set up this trap, one could imagine how terrifying it would be. It had to be fatal.

“That imbecile!” Someone said on the statue as he glared at Lin Yun. The Realm Sons had clearly predicted that Lin Yun would appear, but none of them thought that Lin Yun would be strong enough to start a massacre.

On the altar, Lin Yun was donned in azure clothes. Despite only being nineteen, he gave off an overbearing aura. Looking at the head of the statue, Lin Yun said, “Are you guys going to keep on hiding? Are the war realms a bunch of cowards?”

His words made everyone’s blood begin to boil violently. But right at this moment, a voice filled with killing intent sounded out from the statue, “You’re strong, but there’s no way you can escape death today!”

In the next second, the sky began to tumble as dozens of figures came out from the statue. “The War Generals!”

“The War Generals are actually here!”

“Is this the handiwork of the Realm Sons?” The audience sucked in a cold breath when they looked at the generals. The generals were only second to the Realm Sons. In fact, they were geniuses specially picked out among thousands of people to be the aides of the Realm Sons.

Each Realm Son had four generals, and the generals had their own servants. Based on resources alone, the head of the generals was equal to a Realm Son. Furthermore, the head of the generals all had saint spiritual runes planted in their aura oceans.

Each head of the generals could easily run amok in the Heavenly Path. Aside from the Realm Sons, no one would dare to provoke the head of the generals. At times, they would even represent the war realms.

Now, the generals and even the head generals were present. As an oppressive aura descended from the statue, the crowd started to feel terrible.

“How pitiful for you. You don’t even know that your death is coming.” The head general of the Nether Divinity War Realm was donned in white clothes and held a purple stone tablet in his hand. The stone tablet had ancient spiritual runes engraved on it and emitted an eerie light.

“No one can protect you now that the three Realm Sons want your life!” The Profound Dragon War Realm head general was a black-clothed youth who wielded a crimson war banner that released a faint ripple when he waved it.

“I have no plans on dying today,” sneered Lin Yun.

“You have no idea how strong the three war realms are!” The head general of the Elysium Trigram War Realm spoke up with a ball of fire hovering in front of him with a bone inside. The head generals had powerful weapons that were even more terrifying than the Black Dragon Ruler that made the crowd exclaim. Who would have thought that the Realm Sons bestowed their weapons to the head generals to deal with Lin Yun.

It seemed like the Realm Sons placed a lot of importance on Lin Yun. When Lin Yun saw this, his eyes flickered coldly. “Sooner or later, I’ll show everyone that the Realm Sons are nothing. As for you, all of you will die today!”

“Impudent! You think an imbecile like you is fit to compete with the Realm Sons?” Someone roared furiously because the Realm Sons were existences that couldn’t be humiliated. This also caused everyone to look at Lin Yun coldly with killing intent.

The Realm Sons of the Ten War Realms were unbelievably strong. They were extraordinary and determined to shine in the Heavenly Path. They wanted to use the masses as stepping stones to stand out.

But Lin Yun didn’t have any respect for the Realm Sons, which made the generals furious. On the head of the statue, someone mocked in disdain, “A mere bastard dares to compete with the Realm Sons?”

“Big brother, this bastard is too arrogant. Let me deal with them!” Yelled Nie Xuan. He was still angry that Lin Yun killed all of his servants.

“He’s just an idiot. We can easily suppress him if we work together!” Another general spoke up he was also infuriated by Lin Yun’s words.

“No need. There’s an order from the Realm Sons to capture him. They want to make him kneel before them at Four Phase City for his mistakes,” said Nie Tian, the head general of the Nether Divinity War Realm. It was as if Lin Yun was someone that they could easily suppress.

“Let’s go with the original plan!” said a black-clothed youth from the Profound Dragon War Realm.

“Seal the entire region and suppress him,” said a robust youth from the Elysium Trigram War Realm.

“Roger!” The remaining nine generals spread out on the statue and opened their palms, revealing a pearl in their hands. Then, an ancient spiritual array descended from the sky and enveloped the entire region. Countless terrifying beast souls flew out of the pearls and towards Lin Yun.

“Those are the Beast Soul Pearls! They’re going to set up the Ancient Demon Seal Array!” The spectators couldn’t believe the trap that was set by the Realm Sons.

This was an array that ancient experts would use to capture powerful demonic beasts. Although it normally required powerful experts to set up, it was also possible with nine Beast Soul Pearls. Although they were the genuine Beast Soul Pearls, it was enough to deal with Heavenly Soul Realm geniuses.

Clearly, the war realms had a strong foundation. No wonder the Realm Sons didn’t show up. With this trap in place, they didn’t need to move a finger.

The weapons in the hands of the head generals were terrifying. They shined with boundless light while the entire space trembled. Lin Yun finally knew why the Realm Sons were so confident about sealing off all exits to force Lin Yun towards Four Phase City.

If it wasn’t for the fact that he scratched the surface of the holy spirit martial technique, he would be a dead man. Right now, anything was possible.
