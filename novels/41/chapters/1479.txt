Chapter 1480 - Leaving The Sect

As the majestic nether energy poured into Lin Yun’s body through the Radiant Sword Saint’s fingertips, Lin Yun was shocked because the nether energy needed for the Nether Sword Seed to break open was a little too much. If his master didn’t help him, he had no idea if he could even break open the cocoon before reaching the Dragon Pulse Realm when only relying on himself.

The process didn’t last long. Ten breaths later, black miasma suddenly emerged from Lin Yun’s body as the cocoon in the Twelve-Petaled Netherflower exploded. When the cocoon exploded, a ball of light shone, and a four-foot-long black sword appeared within the Twelve-Petaled Netherflower.

The cocoon from before had disappeared, replaced by this ancient black sword facing up. This blade was purely condensed of nether energy. When the blade appeared, Lin Yun was shocked to discover that the amount of nether energy he could control had increased by ten-fold.

Even the petals of the Netherflower had become more condensed. Most importantly, Lin Yun could feel that his ocean of astral energy had calmed down with the Dragon-Phoenix Sword Aura hovering in the surroundings. His ocean of astral energy had never been so calm before.

The Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron was suppressed to the bottom of the ocean. When Lin Yun opened his eyes, his eyes flickered as if this was unexpected. His two sword sutras had fused together. If he wished to control the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron, it would be easier, and his exhaustion wouldn’t be that great.

“Thank you, Master!” Lin Yun cupped his hands with excitement filling his face. Only he knew how terrifying the improvement of his strength would be when the two sword sutras have perfectly integrated.

The Radiant Sword Saint smiled, looking at Lin Yun. “I did guess that you’re going to leave the sect to train, I just didn’t expect that it’d be for a Divine Dragon Bone. The Divine Dragon Bones are the achilles heel of the Divine Dragon Empire. Those who dare to covet after them are demonic cultivators. So you have to be prepared.”

Lin Yun was briefly stunned. So it turned out that his master already knew everything.

Three days later, when everything was prepared, Lin Yun used his sect medal to send a message to Ye Ziling, Zhao Yan, and the others. As saint disciples, they were still in seclusion on the Saint Mountain.

Lin Yun had no idea how long he would be out for this time. So he informed them beforehand. Then again, he naturally kept the matter about the Divine Dragon Bone a secret.

Typically speaking, the Ancient Barren Domain should be governed by the Divine Dragon Empire, and searching for a Divine Dragon Bone was no different from courting death. Not only that, but the Divine Dragon Empire should be governing the nine domains in the Kunlun Realm.

The Ancient Wind Domain, Ancient Fire Domain, Ancient Lightning Domain, Ancient Ice Domain, and Ancient Saint Domain were directly under the governing of the Divine Dragon Empire, so they could be seen as a whole. The Ancient Heaven Domain, Ancient Earth Domain, Ancient Profound Domain, and Ancient Barren Domain were located in the four directions around the Divine Dragon Empire.

For example, the Ancient Barren Domain was to the east of the Divine Dragon Empire, and the east of the Divine Dragon Empire was called the Eastern Desolation as a collective. The Ancient Barren Domain only occupied 30% of the Eastern Desolation.

In addition to the Ancient Barren Domain, the Eastern Desolation had a boundless territory and terrifying strength.

In the early years, the Divine Dragon Empire planned to use the Ancient Barren Domain to keep all the forces in the Eastern Desolation in check. But their control over the Ancient Barren Domain had gradually diminished over the years. The Ancient Barren Domain might not have an overlord, but they had a rapport, unwilling to be dominated by the Divine Dragon Empire.

This was why the Radiant Sword Saint had no intention of stopping Lin Yun, even after knowing that he was aiming for a Divine Dragon Bone.

“Lil’ Purple, are you ready?” Lin Yun stood with his hands behind his back as he talked to Lil’ Purple, who was in the sword box. Lil’ Purple had been making preparations all this time, refining the Myriad Lightning Divine Rune to prepare a trump card for Lin Yun.

“Almost there. You can immediately use the Myriad Lightning Divine Rune when needed. So you don't have to be too afraid even if you run into a Dragon Pulse Realm expert.” Lil’ Purple nodded. “But wait for a little longer. Lil’ Red is still asleep.”

“I can’t wait any longer. Today is the agreed date, and I have to go now.” Lin Yun left the Cloud Soaring Peak carrying the sword box. Right at that moment, a woman appeared, emitting a faint fragrance; she was Mu Qingqing.

“Lin Yun, you’re going to leave?” Mu Qingqing asked as she looked at Lin Yun.

Lin Yun was puzzled because he didn’t remember telling anyone else that he was leaving. So how did Mu Qingqing know? Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Hehe. My father told me. Speaking of which, why didn’t you tell my father that you’re leaving? He found out from your master.” Mu Qingqing looked at Lin Yun with complaints.

Lin Yun smiled embarrassedly because he was truly at fault for this matter. However, the main reason was the sect master’s position was too high, and he didn’t think that it was anything important for him to leave the sect to train. So he never thought about informing the sect master.

After all, he would have to tell the sect master that he was going after a Divine Dragon Bone if he went. But the news about the Divine Dragon Bone was told to him by An Liuyan, and there was a high possibility that An Liuyan was a cultivator of the demonic path. So it wasn’t too appropriate for him to talk about it.

“How long are you going to be out for?” Mu Qingqing asked, blinking her eyes.

“At least three months, six months max.” Lin Yun said after a brief pondering. He gave a relatively conservative time. He wasn’t exactly sure about the time because it would definitely not be peaceful.

“So long?” Mu Qingqing frowned before she said, “Then don’t miss out on the Heavenly Pool Gathering.”

“Heavenly Pool Gathering?” Lin Yun asked.

“Yeah. It’s a gathering for the eight powerful sects in the Ancient Barren Domain, where disciples of the younger generation will come together. The saints’ disciples should be out by then, and it will definitely be lively.” Mu Qingqing explained. “As long as you’re back within six months, you shouldn’t miss it.”

Lin Yun instantly understood what it was. So it was like a tea party or something. But was there anything special about it for Mu Qingqing to inform him specifically?

But just when he was about to ask it, Mu Qingqing smiled, “Just remember not to miss it. You’ll find out at that time!”

“Alright, then.” Lin Yun smiled.

“Go on. You have yet to receive a task in the Contribution Hall. My father didn’t tell me what you’re going to do, but remember to come back safely. After all, you have a lot of enemies out there.” Mu Qingqing said in a worried tone.

“I will.” Lin Yun and Mu Qingqing bade farewell and he left the Sword Sect, heading for the Heavenly Cauldron Pavilion in Azurerock City.

As soon as Lin Yun left the Sword Sect, news swiftly spread out about his departure from the Sword Sect.

There was a spiritual mountain shrouded in heavy fog in the Profound Sky Sect. Within the mountain, Qin Cang was there with a golden dragon coiled around him and a terrifying dragon aura was sweeping out.

Right then, an old man donned in golden clothes flew over, leaving afterimages in the air, before landing before Qin Cang. If Lin Yun was there, he would definitely recognize this old man because this was Jin Jue, the one who tried to disregard the rules of the Heavenly Path to kill him.

As he hovered in mid-air, he looked at Qin Cang with a gloomy face. “Young Master, I just received news that Lin Yun has left the Sword Sect.”

He was a Samsara Edict Realm expert, an elder in the Profound Sky Sect. By right, he should have a higher position than Qin Cang, but he had another identity. He was the servant of the Nether Divinity Clan. So he had no airs of an elder around Qin Cang.

As Qin Cang let out a breath, his eyes shone brightly, “That fellow was holed up in the Sword Sect for seven months, and he’s finally willing to come out? Did you find out why he left the Sword Sect? Did he leave alone or in a group?”

Whether it was the hatred of the Nether Divinity Clan or the grudge between them, he hated Lin Yun to the core. For the past year, Qin Cang was restrained after Lin Yun defeated him. In the past, he had disregarded everyone because he was invincible amongst those in the same generation, not to mention that he also had the Golden Dragon Bone.

But not only did he lose that battle with Lin Yun, he even lost the Golden Dragon Bone and was reduced to a complete cripple. But thankfully, his master didn’t give up on him, which was a blessing in disguise. So he had now been reborn from the cocoon, and he was far stronger than before. Most importantly, he had officially taken Tian Xuanzi as his master.

“I still don’t know what his purpose is, but I’m certain that he’s alone.” Jin Jue said with cold, killing intent flashing through his pupils.

“Are you sure about that?” Qin Cang said in a deep voice with his eyes flickering.

“I’m sure about that.” Jin Jue nodded.

“He’s currently at the two-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm, right?” Qin Cang asked. He was clearly in the Profound Sky Sect, but he had information on Lin Yun. He knew him so well that it was like the back of his hand. This was no big deal because powerful sects naturally planted spies in the other sects as well, and it wasn’t something that could be prevented. Not to mention that Lin Yun’s cultivation wasn’t classified. So it wasn’t hard for him to find out about it.

“That’s right. But according to the rumors, he swept through the Earth Ranking alone, and not even geniuses at the five-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm can do anything to him.” Jin Jue gritted his teeth.

He wasn’t surprised by Lin Yun’s strength. Back on the Heavenly Path, he had personally watched Lin Yun defeating the ten realm sons. He was clear that Lin Yun would be like a dragon returning to the ocean after he descended into the Kunlun Realm. So he had already expected that Lin Yun would be a disaster sooner or later.

“Since he dares to leave the territory of the Sword Sect, I’ll personally go and take his life!” Jin Jue said with a light flashing in his pupils.

His words made Qin Cang’s face change as he said, “Don’t forget that you’re an elder of the Profound Sky Sect.”

This old fellow was really reckless to not think of the consequences. If his identity was exposed, it would be equivalent to waging war with the Sword Sect. At that time, disciples of the Profound Sky Sect would definitely be assassinated, and the agreement between the powerful sects would be broken.

But the Nether Divinity Realm Son’s death in Lin Yun’s hands made the Nether Divinity Saint Clan hate Lin Yun. This was why Jin Jue threw the interest of the Profound Sky Sect to the side.

“He’s just an ant at the Elysium Core Realm. I can get this done cleanly. The Nether Divinity Saint Clan has been titled by the Divine Dragon Empire, and it’ll be a stain on us if we don’t kill him!” Jin Jue replied.

“You are to be blamed for the death of the realm son. I can understand that you want to make amendments. But are you so sure he doesn’t have anyone around him to ensure his safety in secret?” Qin Cang snorted. “Even if there’s no one protecting him, he definitely has a protection talisman given by the Radiant Sword Saint. Use that pig brain of yours to think. Do you think the disciple of the Radiant Sword Saint is so easy to kill?”

Jin Jue was scolded to the point that he didn’t dare to utter a word.

Qin Cang briefly pondered before he continued, “But it’s a pity that I’m in the midst of a breakthrough. Otherwise, I would really like to meet him again.”

His face changed as he paced back and forth, thinking of a solution. He knew it was hard to kill Lin Yun without anyone knowing, but this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for him. Whether it was his hatred for Lin Yun or the Profound Wither Key, Qin Cang had many reasons to kill him.

But no matter how he thought about it, he could feel a headache. If he wasn’t so careless back on the Profound Wither Island, he wouldn’t have been placed in such a difficult position. After all, Lin Yun’s identity as the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple was too heavy.

If it was really as Jin Jue suggested, the Sword Sect would definitely take revenge if this matter became exposed. Ultimately, it would just result in an endless loop of the two sects assassinating each other’s genius disciples.

“You don’t need to worry about this. I’ll discuss this with my master. I have to know his objective for leaving the Sword Sect.” Qin Cang’s face was cloudy. He then left after he was done speaking. But he didn’t notice that Jin Jue’s face was ugly when he left.

Jin Jue ultimately shook his head with dissatisfaction in his eyes. Ever since Lin Yun defeated Qin Cang, Qin Cang had lost his fighting spirit and was indecisive in killing an ant at the Elysium Core Realm. If they didn’t kill Lin Yun now, it would be troublesome when he grows up.

So what if Lin Yun was the disciple of the Radiant Sword Saint? The moment he left the Sword Sect’s territory, there would be plenty of ways to kill him, and one wouldn’t be so indecisive at this point.

Without any hesitation, Jin Jue left the sect with a killing aura flashing on his face.
