Chapter 1031 - Injured

“Are you sure we should do that? That woman didn’t say anything, but there’s a high possibility that she comes from the Heavenly Fox Clan,” said the Elysium Trigram Realm Son.

“We can’t do anything about it right now. We’ve been good to her lately, so we should teach her a lesson. Furthermore, that brat definitely has a deep relationship with her. Let’s see how long he can keep running away. He thinks he can kill us in the Heavenly Path? I’ll show him!” The Nether Divinity Realm Son said through his clenched jaw.

The Profound Dragon Realm Son who had maintained his silence said, “Let’s leave it at this. We can’t possibly take action in Four Phase City. As for that woman’s origin…let’s pretend that we don’t know anything since she didn’t say a word. Our inheritances in the Kunlun Realm won’t be lacking if we can obtain the Divine Blood Fruit!”

Four Phase City was overseen by powerful sects. Battles were allowed in the city, but there was a strict no killing policy. Not even the Realm Sons could violate this rule. After all, Four Phase City was the final gathering point for those who wanted to continue through the Heavenly Path and those who wanted to stop. However, the Realm Sons seemed to be planning something since they were certain that Lin Yun would deliver himself over.

Suddenly, the Nether Divinity Realm Son spoke, “Where are our treasures?”

He was referring to the Nether Divinity Tablet, Profound Dragon War Banner, and Elysium Trigram Demon Claw. They were the treasures that were personally entrusted to them by their clans. The treasures were so powerful that they weren’t able to bring out the full power yet.

The treasures had protected them in the forbidden regions. They could tell that Lin Yun was extremely cautious of their treasures. Even after killing everyone, Lin Yun didn’t touch their treasures. He was probably worried that the treasures might have seals that could be manipulated from afar.

Not even the crowd at the altar dared to steal the treasures.

“They’re gone!” The faces of the Realm Sons changed. They gave their powerful treasures to their head generals to suppress Lin Yun. But now, the powerful treasures were missing. They had no idea what was going on. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The Realm Sons were enraged that someone dared to steal their treasures. But when they looked around the battlefield, they noticed something weird. “Something isn’t right. Someone cleaned up the battlefield. Look! The interspatial pouches owned by the generals are gone!”

“Damn it! Who did this?! Who took the Blacklight Battle Armor of my Elysium Trigram War Realm!”

“The Beast Soul Pearls are also gone!”

“The ruler and whip are also gone! Damn it! What the hell happened here?!” All three of them suddenly felt a chill run down their spine. They weren’t too sure about what happened to the treasures, but they were certain that the interspatial pouches and artifacts were around when they arrived.

How could they all disappear in the blink of an eye when all they did was watch Lin Yun run away. The only logical explanation was that someone secretly stole everything from right under their nose!

Although the other treasures couldn’t catch their attention, they still had some worth. Naturally, they felt angry that everything valuable had disappeared.

Meanwhile, Lin Yun landed on a barren mountain together with Pei Xue. From the mountain, they could roughly see the outline of Four Phase City. Even without entering the city, they had reached a safe zone.

Lin Yun put Pei Xue down before lifting his clothes to examine his upper body. There were several sinister wounds on his body, all of which emitted a corrosive aura. They were the injuries that he suffered facing the Ancient Demon Seal Array. Although he forcibly broke the array, he was injured. The Beast Soul Pearls were mixed with a wisp of demonic aura, so the wounds created a type of fatal poison.

If Lin Yun didn’t cultivate the Azure Dragon Saint Physique, he might be dead right now. It was the main reason why the head generals were so confident that Lin Yun would die. Additionally, they had the Realm Sons’ treasures, which would cause Lin Yun trouble. Although they weren’t as terrifying as the Ancient Demon Seal Array, they were still difficult to deal with. They were difficult enough that his sword intent couldn’t get rid of the ancient dao rhyme in his wounds.

“How troublesome.” Lin Yun locked his brows together. These wounds wouldn’t kill him, but they weren't easy to deal with. Fortunately, he had reached Four Phase City, so he was safe. Suddenly, exhaustion overwhelmed him as he felt like he would collapse at any moment.

“Pig, are you alright?” Pei Xue was startled by this scene because Lin Yun’s face had instantly turned pale. She suddenly recalled the dark region enveloped by the Ancient Demon Seal Array.

Something must’ve taken place in that region. After all, everyone felt terrible from the shockwave of the Ancient Demon Seal Array. Since Lin Yun was at the center of the shockwave, there was no way he was okay. If it wasn’t for the fact that the head generals didn’t use Yue Weiwei to taunt him, Lin Yun wouldn’t have pushed himself so far.

“It’s fine. I’ll be fine after some rest,” muttered Lin Yun before he collapsed onto the ground. This startled Pei Xue as she stood up to help Lin Yun. When she got close and saw his injuries, her face changed. She covered her mouth in shock because Lin Yun’s injuries were more terrifying than she thought they would be.

It seemed like he suffered a few injuries on top of the ones from the Ancient Demon Seal Array. Technically, the head generals weren’t pushovers, so they must have been hard for Lin Yun to face. After all, the head generals had the treasures of the Realm Sons.

Although it seemed like Lin Yun easily dealt with them, he wasn’t a god. He might be an extraordinary talent, but he still had to pay a price to kill them.

“Pig!” Pei Xue’s eyes turned red. She replayed the scene when Lin Yun grabbed her after the battle despite being so heavily injured. Up to this point, Lin Yun helped her out quite a lot. He had been so gracious that she wouldn’t complain if he left her behind.

In reality, she knew that Lin Yun could easily leave if he didn’t have to bring her along. If it wasn’t for her, he wouldn’t have suffered so many injuries. Right at this moment, Lil’ Red appeared and chuckled. After all, it cleaned up the battlefield right under the noses of the Realm Sons.

But when it saw Lin Yun’s state, it immediately panicked. In a frenzied state, Lil’ Red started to take treasures out of the interspatial pouches. Lil’ Red was normally stingy with its treasures, but it didn’t hesitate to give everything to Lin Yun in this time of need.

Pei Xue was surprised because she never expected Lin Yun’s pet to be so willing to hand out treasures. Furthermore, the value of some treasures even surprised her.

Occasionally, Lil’ Red would take out a treasure and ask Pei Xue to feed it to Lin Yun. Not long later, Lin Yun’s body began to turn red as dense spiritual energy leaked out of his pores. When Pei Xue saw this scene, she knew that she had to stop Lil’ Red, “That’s enough.”

Lin Yun’s condition wasn’t that terrible because he had a strong vitality. However, his injuries were extremely serious and he had to deal with origin energy exhaustion.
