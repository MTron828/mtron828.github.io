Chapter 1780 – Wind Swordsman

After Lin Yun, the ensuing battles were duller in comparison. The battle between him and Yan Tie was exciting, making the fights between those beneath the top hundredth pale in comparison.

However, the atmosphere was still heated because many top-tiered experts still hadn’t fought, like the Four Young Masters and holy land geniuses. After Lin Yun defeated Yan Tie, he naturally became honored as the strongest swordsman on the Dragon Pulse Ranking.

Compared to him, both the Wind Swordsman and Cloud Swordsman were paler. But after Wind Swordsman Shi Feng went on the stage, everyone realized they had made a big mistake. As soon as he stood out, he quickly won four battles and ended each one in an instant.

He first fought Yuan Hao, but the latter could only block two strikes before he was defeated by the third. A sword was pointed at his forehead, and blood rolled down his face.

This made Yuan Hao’s face pale, and he fell into despair. He would have already been dead if this was a battle with their lives on the line. His second opponent was a swordsman from the Heavenly Dao Sect, ranked nineteenth on the Dragon Pulse Ranking. But his defeat was even worse, and he was defeated with one strike because Shi Feng’s attack was too fast.

Shi Feng was terribly fast, like a ghost. When his opponent realized it, Shi Feng’s sword was already on his neck. His third opponent was ruthless and kept moving about the stage, not engaging Shi Feng in a direct confrontation.

But when they clashed, his opponent quickly lost. In just three moves, Shi Feng knocked his opponent’s weapon away, and his sword stabbed into his opponent’s chest. This instantly scared his opponent into conceding.

His fourth opponent wasn’t an easy one. It was a genius from the Heavenly Dao Sect, ranked thirteenth on the Dragon Pulse Ranking. This opponent fared slightly better but only managed to last fifteen swords from Shi Feng. With that, Shi Feng won all four battles, surprising everyone.

“Holy shit. The Wind Swordsman is so strong?”

“Isn’t his sword a little too fast? Why didn’t he challenge Lin Yun with his strength?”

“I don’t know. Maybe it’s because only swordsmen understand swordsmen the best. He knows he’s not Lin Yun’s opponent, and it’s pointless for them to fight.” Discussions resounded from the surroundings, and none of the three swordsmen on the Dragon Pulse Ranking received their fame by a fluke.

Looking at Lin Yun, Yue Weiwei said, “This person is strong. Who is stronger? He or Yan Tie?”

“In a martial competition, Yan Tie has a higher odds of winning. But in battle with their lives on the line, they both have a chance. In reality, this competition somewhat limits the strength of a swordsman because the true strength of a swordsman can only be brought out by fighting with their lives on the line, as long as there is a thirty percent chance of winning. The other geniuses on the Dragon Pulse Ranking might not have that courage.” Lin Yun said.

“I see…” Yue Weiwei held onto her chin. Lin Yun’s explanation refreshed her understanding of swordsmen. After a brief pondering, she asked, “Then, why can’t others avoid his sword?”

“You should ask why his opponent let him swing his sword.” Lin Yun smiled. Swordsmen were proficient in catching the flaws in his opponents’ attacks, not to mention Shi Feng grasped the Wind Intent. Wind can be found everywhere, meaning he was ten times more proficient in finding his opponents’ flaws.

If his opponents couldn’t sense his wind, they wouldn’t be able to put up any resistance. So when Shi Feng drew his sword, this meant he had detected the flaw in his opponents’ attacks. Under these circumstances, it was naturally tough for his opponent to fend off his attack.

But this was the charm of a swordsman. Because even if anyone could figure it out, it didn’t necessarily mean they could guard against it. So after four consecutive wins, everyone was frightened by Shi Feng’s performance, and they fell silent.

“Let me face you.” The Wind Edge Lord smiled, and a lightning bolt descended on the Thunderblood Battlestage. In his view, Lin Yun and Shi Feng had enough spotlight, and it was time for him to appear onstage. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“The Wind Edge Lord went on the stage!” Shi Feng’s strength finally drew the attention of those in the top ten on the Dragon Pulse Ranking, and Wind Edge Lord stood out. The Four Young Masters had strength in the top ten on the Dragon Pulse Ranking, and the Wind Edge Lord had high fame, especially in the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea. His fame here was even more significant than the holy land geniuses.

“Finally, a challenge.” Shi Feng smiled, and his expression became grave. In his view, those in the top ten were on a whole new level. This was because those beneath the top ten couldn’t even hold a candle to them. It was like they were in two different worlds.

Everyone in the top ten on the Dragon Pulse Ranking had reached a limit in their cultivation, and you wouldn’t understand how terrifying they were if you didn’t witness their strength. But a swordsman didn’t have to care about that. As long as there were thirty percent odds of winning, it was enough for them to give it a go, not to mention that their actual odds might not be just thirty percent.

Shi Feng and the Wind Edge Lord were a few hundred meters away, and a breeze suddenly blew across the Thunderstorm Battlestage.

The moment the wind rose, the Wind Edge Lord made his move. His movements were light and agile, and he instantly appeared before Shi Feng. Only then did Shi Feng draw his sword out by three inches, unleashing a dazzling sword ray and illuminating the surroundings with an explosively powerful sword aura.

But he was interrupted the next moment when the Wind Edge Lord slapped Shi Feng’s sword hilt, forcing the sword back into the sword scabbard. The Wind Edge Lord’s method of attacking was simple yet overbearing.

After pushing the sword back into the sheath, the Wind Edge Lord’s other hand fell on Shi Feng’s chest. Shi Feng squinted his eyes upon seeing this, but there was nothing he could do but retreat. He knew he had to draw his sword, or he wouldn’t even be able to hold his ground against the Wind Edge Lord.

But the Wind Edge Lord smirked, closely following Shi Feng like a shadow.

Shi Feng took ten consecutive steps back. But whenever he wanted to draw his sword, he would be interrupted by the Wind Edge Lord. After taking ten steps back, his aura fell to rock bottom, and his face was ugly.

In the end, a decisive light flickered across the Wind Edge Lord’s pupils, and he took a palm from the Wind Edge Lord. When a mouthful of blood gushed out from his mouth, She Feng was sent a few hundred meters away. But when he was in mid-air, he finally managed to draw his sword for the first time since the beginning of this battle.

This sword that had been held in for so long was finally unleashed. Before Shi Feng landed on the ground, he thrust forth like a bolt of lightning. With a retreat before advancing, his aura had enough time to climb to the peak, seeking life through death, and this was a swordsman.

Everything happened too quickly, and Shi Feng disappeared from everyone’s eyes. This shocked them because they knew a decisive moment had come. In the previous battles, his opponents would fall into a disadvantageous position whenever Shi Feng drew his sword, even if his sword didn’t strike them.

His sword was terrifying, making everyone feel a chill run down their spines. But the Wind Edge Lord had no fear on his face, and he pushed his palms downward. With an explosion, Shi Feng was forced to show himself in mid-air.

As ripples spread out in space, Shi Feng's sword began to slow down the closer it got to the Wind Edge Lord.

This made the Wind Edge Lord smile, and he clamped onto Shi Feng’s sword with two fingers. This changed Shi Feng’s face, but the Wind Edge Lord flung the sword away before he could draw his sword back.

The force behind that throw made Shi Feng uncontrollably rotate in the air. When he landed on the ground, he took three steps back before throwing another mouthful of blood.

But Shi Feng wasn’t someone who would give up so easily. He wasn’t an ordinary swordsman and maintained his composure, even after being in a disadvantageous position. He held onto his hand with both hands, and a violent gale began to sweep around him, with the invisible wind shining and blooming like a flower.

“Let’s end this game.” The Wind Edge Lord sneered. With a roar, he summoned his nine dragon pulses, and the length of each dragon pulse was close to four thousand feet. Unleashing his cultivation instantly crushed Shi Feng’s sword aura.

Shi Feng spat out blood for the third time before he fell to the ground with one knee. The pressure of the Wing Edge Lord’s dragon pulses was like an army, making him look like a war god on the battlefield.

“The Wind Edge Lord wins!” When the Autumn Mountain Lord saw that Shi Feng showed no intentions of conceding, he quickly announced the result of this battle because he didn’t want Shi Feng to lose his life here.

“The three swordsmen of the Dragon Pulse Ranking don’t seem impressive after all.” The Wind Edge Lord smirked, and threw a faint glance at Lin Yun. Everyone could understand the meaning behind his words. He wasn’t only looking down on the three swordsmen but also on Lin Yun, who had high popularity. Based on the strength he displayed, he was qualified to say those words.

Shi Feng glanced at the Autumn Mountain Lord but ultimately said nothing about the latter announcing the result. Instead, he said, “If this was a battle with our lives on the line, I wouldn’t lose so terribly.”

“You should rejoice that we’re only having a friendly battle, or you’d lose even more terribly. You should know why no swordsmen are ranked in the top ten of the Dragon Pulse Ranking. Swordsmen might seem fearless towards death, but most take the wrong path. That’s the same case for you.” The Wind Edge Lord snickered. “Once you encounter a genuine expert, you will only lose terribly. If it’s that Yuan Hao, whom you previously defeated, he might be able to last longer in my hands.”

“There’s nothing I can say about that since I lost, but you’re really ignorant.” Shi Feng said, squinting his eyes. Anyone could tell he wasn’t happy, especially when swordsmen were generally mocked. But there was nothing he could say since he lost, and it was a futile effort to argue about it.

“I didn’t expect the top ten on the Dragon Pulse Ranking to be so strong. The Wind Swordsman can’t even put up a fight against the Wind Edge Lord.”

“What are you thinking? Although the Dragon Pulse Ranking can only be used as a reference, the ranking isn’t exactly useless, or they would be kicked out from the top ten a long time ago.”

“Are swordsmen so weak?”

“Obviously not. The Wind Edge Lord said that on purpose, and he’s clearly targeting Lin Xiao. He had a feud with Lin Xiao before.” Discussions resounded from the surroundings, making many people doubt whether being a swordsman was worthwhile and wondered if they were worthless.

Since the Wind Edge Lord had already achieved his goal, he no longer continued to fight and left.

A figure arrived in Lin Yun's pavilion and sat opposite him. It was Shi Feng. After being defeated, he didn’t return to his position, but came to the pavilion where Lin Yun and Yue Weiwei were located.

“I hope you two don’t mind me sitting here?” Shi Feng smiled.

“Certainly not.” Lin Yun smiled.

Yue Weiwei didn’t say a word, but she clearly didn’t mind Shi Feng’s arrival, either.

Looking at Shi Feng gulping down wine in depression, Lin Yun asked, “It looks like swordsmen don’t seem to have a positive situation in the Eastern Desolation’s Dragon Pulse Ranking.”

“Not exactly. The sword dao has a strong foundation in the Heavenly Dao Sect. The Divine Phoenix Mountain and Ming Cult also have experts who use swords. But they were too brutally suppressed by Jian Jingtian on the Dragon Pulse Ranking, and they had long made a breakthrough to the Samsara Edict Realm.” Shi Feng smiled bitterly.

“Now that Jian Jingtian is no longer on the Dragon Pulse Ranking and there is no swordsman in the top ten, this became the reason why the Wind Edge Lord is so arrogant. But I have a feeling that he has underestimated you. So, tell me. What are your odds of defeating him?” Shi Feng wasn’t happy that he lost to the Wind Edge Lord and could only place his hopes on Lin Yun.

But Lin Yun merely replied with a smile and maintained his silence.
