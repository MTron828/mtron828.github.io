Chapter 775 - Drawing the Flower Burial Sword

Aside from Lin Yun, no one had expected that Feng Wudao would win. After all, his opponent was top-tier genius Yang Teng. Everyone could tell that Yang Teng was strong, but it was a pity that he underestimated his opponent. By the time he realized his mistake, it was too late.

Even a tiny flaw would get amplified in a battle, not to mention that Feng Wudao was even stronger than Yang Teng. From this, the outcome was determined the moment they fought. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

The defeat of a top-tier genius caused a huge commotion among the crowd. This had been the most breathtaking battle in the Draconic Banquet so far. There were also experts in the other groups, but their opponents were much too weak. Those fights would end in less than five moves.

In that split second, countless gazes fell on Feng Wudao and people began talking about him. Compared to Lin Yun, Feng Wudao’s victory was more breathtaking.

“This Feng Wudao is strong. Where did he come from?”

“Who knows. But there are geniuses like him at every Draconic Banquet.”

“Yu Haotian appeared like this at the previous Draconic Banquet. Not even people from the Indigomoon Elysium knew about him. He came in and defeated everyone in the Draconic Banquet to take first place.”

“I wonder if he concealed his strength. I’m looking forward to his performance in the elimination round.”

“Speaking of which, compared to the seventh group, there are too few geniuses in the other groups.” Everyone began to discuss the groupings as Feng Wudao’s popularity swiftly soared. The geniuses of the other groups also paid attention to him and engraved his name in their hearts.

Afterwards, the Draconic Banquet continued like usual. Perhaps it was because this was only the first round that not many people gave it their all. They would admit defeat the moment they realized that they were on the lower end. After all, it wasn’t wise to get heavily injured in the first round.

Most battles ended within ten moves and the others didn’t go past fifty. Even Lin Yun had fought several matches, but he didn’t cause much commotion as he didn’t use his spiritual sword intent. When he was free, he would pay attention to the other competitors in the other groups.

Feng Ye’s luck wasn’t good as he had lost three matches in a row. The profound amber aura in his jade token was nearly exhausted and he would lose his qualification in the banquet if he lost another match. As for Bai Lixuan, he shined brightly as a newly risen genius. Up until now, not many people could last more than ten moves against him. They couldn’t even force him to use his Azure Dragon Sword Sutra.

His sword technique had improved a lot. In his hand, his sword ray flashed like a bolt of lightning and would manifest into various ominous beasts. His sword technique contained profound lightning energy that rumbled violently.

This made Lin Yun fall into deep thought as he suspected that Bai Lixuan had comprehended lightning intent. After a few battles, Bai Lixuan ran into someone powerful. This person was also a newly risen genius. The two fought for a long time and Bai Lixuan began to emit a holy glow in the end.

After a hundred moves, Bai Lixuan’s advantage from his Saint Physique was revealed, which made his opponent admit defeat. His opponent was young. Even after he admitted defeat, his eyes were still filled with reluctance, “If you didn’t have the Saint Physique, you wouldn’t be able to win so easily. You won’t be able to defeat me in the elimination round.”

“Saint Physique? So what if I have the Saint Physique? Can it allow me to defeat the three kings and seven geniuses?” Bai Lixuan replied without any expression on his face. The pride he once had for his Saint Physique was gone after he lost to Lin Yun one year ago. After all, Lin Yun was nothing but an ant in his eyes many years ago.

After leaving the Great Qin Empire, he met many geniuses and found out that his Saint Physique was not that impressive. Bai Lixuan glanced at his opponent and left. “Your sights are too low, so you won’t be able to go far.”

Still not using your Azure Dragon Sword Sutra? Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with shock as Bai Lixuan had greatly improved since they last met in the Withernorth Sea.

This Draconic Banquet was truly filled with hidden dragons. The pressure from the newly risen geniuses was huge, not to mention the three kings and seven elites. Ji Wuye also had a pretty good performance in the first round, especially since he only lost once.

As for Yang Fan, he lost a few more rounds, but he also won a few. He still had hopes of making it into the second round. As for Wu Xiaotian, none of his opponents dared to get on the stage. After all, Wu Xiaotian’s reputation from the previous banquet was too terrifying. His opponents admitted defeat the moment they were called.

Time gradually passed and many newly risen geniuses caught the attention of others.

“This Draconic Banquet is truly worthy of being known as the most exciting one from past millennia. The competition is really intense.”

“Many geniuses on the Dragoncloud Ranking were defeated. Those like Bai Lixuan and Feng Wudao have the qualification to make it onto this Dragoncloud Ranking.”

“It's a shame that the reputation of the three kings and seven elites is too great. We won’t get to witness how powerful they are.”

“We probably have to wait until the elimination round to see them in action. It’s really exciting. I wonder how much the three kings have grown over the years and whether the seven elites have the qualification to challenge them.” As more experts began to appear, the atmosphere became even more excited.

There were many exciting battles and people had no idea where to look. Fifteen minutes later, Lin Yun heard his name being called once more. This time, his opponent was Yan Luoyu, a core disciple of the Indigomoon Elysium.

Among the nine overlord forces, the Indigomoon Elysium had the most disciples and they were truly worthy of their prestige as the strongest overlord force. Up to this point, the records of the Indigomoon Elysium’s disciples were good.

Yan Luoyu was a ruthless person in the seventh group. He won several battles and each of his victories were beautiful. However, he had yet to encounter a decent opponent, so his fame wasn’t as high as Feng Wudao. But he wasn’t weak at all. Among the dozens of Indigomoon Elysium disciples, he was ranked in the top seven.

The seventh group’s judge narrowed his eyes from mid-air as Lin Yun had finally encountered a decent enemy. This time, he would finally get to see more of Lin Yun’s strength. The judge had been paying attention to Lin Yun and found it a pity that Lin Yun didn’t encounter any powerful opponents yet.

“Lin Yun, the price on your head is terrifyingly high in the Indigomoon Elysium.” Yan Luoyu looked at Lin Yun with a playful smile as killing intent filled his cold eyes. Although the Indigomoon Elysium suppressed the Skymound City incident from spreading, it was still known by many people in the sect. They had a deep impression of Lin Yun’s name and were given orders by their elders to kill Lin Yun if they ran into him.

“Many people want my life, but you’re not even among the top ten,” said Lin Yun indifferently.

“Who knows if I don’t try?” Yan Luoyu’s eyes flashed as Lin Yun’s attitude enraged him. After all, he was a core disciple of the Indigomoon Elysium and not even a top-tier genius dared to treat him lightly.

“Brilliant Moon, Kill!” Yan Luoyu roared as he pushed the Indigomoon Sutra to the limit. Purple origin energy spread out from his body in the form of mist that slowly condensed into tentacles. Then, they manifested a purple moon that charged at Lin Yun.

Lin Yun merely flicked his finger and unleashed a silver sword ray that pierced through the purple moon.

“You’re courting death!” Yan Luoyu was shocked as he didn’t think that Lin Yun was so powerful. He was truly surprised that Lin Yun destroyed his purple moon with a flick of the finger. Taking a step forward, Yan Luoyu formed seals with both his hands. The shattered moon turned into thousands of fragments that formed a huge net. “Intoxicating Moon Storm!”

The moonlight intertwined with the huge net before turning into a sphere that spun towards Lin Yun. In the blink of an eye, countless purple fragments shot towards Lin Yun that cast a dazzling brilliance on the Dragonsoaring Stage.

Every single strand of light was comparable to the strongest attack of a pinnacle Yin-Yang stage expert and the fragments moved randomly. Wherever the light would pass through the air, smoke would rise as if the air was being burned.

As Lin Yun avoided the attack, he left behind countless afterimages on the stage.

“What power!”

“It’s another one of Indigomoon Elysium’s disciples!”

“The Indigomoon Elysium is going to defy the heavens!”

“Looks like there are experts in the seventh group. At the very least, there is Feng Wudao, Qin Yang, and Yan Luoyu.” The spherical net radiated purple light as it enveloped the entire stage. The bright light drew the attention of many people.

“When are you going to stop dodging?” Yan Luoyu snickered as he started forming seals with his hands, which caused the light rays to become even more concentrated.

Once he finished yelling, a brilliant sword ray exploded from the stage and suppressed the purple radiance. The entire stage became dark and the only light came from the sword ray. Yan Luoyu narrowed his eyes when he saw this as the sword ray got bigger and bigger.

When the sword ray dissipated, Yan Luoyu threw up blood and fell into the lake. When he fell into the lake, he created a huge splash of water.

“Annoying. I should’ve drawn my sword at the beginning,” said Lin Yun as he shook his head while sheathing his sword.
