Chapter 1903 - Scumbag

Lin Yun’s oath was severe, especially for a swordsman like him. If he went against his oath, he would have to suffer the backlash. Even if he wasn’t struck by lightning, he might die from the heart demon during his breakthrough. In lighter cases, he wouldn’t be able to make a breakthrough in his life, like how Jian Jingtian was trapped within the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. So Bai Shuying hesitated because the idea of someone replacing Ye Qingtian had never crossed her mind.

When Lin Yun noticed that the killing intent within Bai Shuying’s pupils was disappearing, he secretly heaved a sigh of relief. He didn’t want to cross hands with Bai Shuying now because there was a massive flaw with the Divine Tortoise Transformation, and it would deactivate by itself if he was pushed to the limit. Bai Shuying’s strength might not be able to force him to that limit, but it was best for him not to take any risks.

Furrowing her brows, Bai Shuying said, “It better have nothing to do with you, and I’m here to make things clear with you today.”

“I…” But before Lin Yun could finish, Bai Shuying interrupted him. She coldly said, “Don’t speak and just listen. Regarding what happened a year ago, I promised my master to let it go because of the Azure River Sword Saint. But don’t forget that my desire to kill you has never diminished.

“Your character hasn’t changed over the past year, and I have to clarify things with you beforehand. Don’t provoke me, and don’t even think I will fall for someone like you. I’m telling you this so that you’ll know the reason if you die in my hands one day.” Bai Shuying briefly paused, before she continued, “I have killed people ever since I was eight years old, and I have slain many people with my sword. So don’t think that you’re special.”

She was troubled for a long time and nearly lost control of her murderous intent back at the Nether Orchid Courtyard. But she ultimately held it because Ye Qingtian had just returned. But after what happened to Zhang Yue, Bai Shuying felt it was related to Ye Qingtian.

After all, not just anyone could write what was written on that letter, and she had never heard of the poem Ye Qingtian recited back at the Nether Orchid Courtyard. This was why she came to Ye Qingtian today.

Shrugging his shoulders, Lin Yun smiled, “Senior Sister, that’s a little hurtful. If anyone wants to kill me, I’ll do everything possible to live. But if you want to kill me, I won’t dodge, as I’ve said before. I’m willing to die to prove my feelings to you.”

The moment he said that, a sword ray appeared before Lin Yun. This sword ray was fast, and Lin Yun nearly couldn’t respond in time, even with his Sword Heart. He only saw a blur, and he retreated by instinct. As a few strands of hair fell on the ground, Bai Shuying already sheathed her sword.

“I won’t even believe a single word you said,” Bai Shuying coldly looked at Lin Yun.

Bai Shuying’s counterattack came too quickly, instantly placing Lin Yun awkward in an awkward position. All the saint disciples beneath the Celestial Purging Courtyard snickered, looking at Ye Qingtian with mockery.

“Sorry, I thought someone else attacked me, and I instinctively reacted. After all, too many people are jealous of my talent,” Lin Yun smiled, stabilizing himself. “Senior Sister, you can come at me again, slower this time. I guarantee that I won’t dodge this time.”

Bai Shuying wasn’t polite with him and drew her sword. This time, everyone could see how she drew her sword. Her sword was so slow that anyone could see the sword’s trajectory. But the power contained in this sword was a lot stronger than the previous sword.

The moment Bai Shuying drew her sword, everyone quickly retreated. But Lin Yun didn’t move and merely smiled as he looked at the sword coming at him.

“Is that fellow really courting death?” Everyone’s faces changed as they looked at Ye Qingtian because anyone could tell that Bai Shuying wasn’t holding back in her attack. If he didn’t avoid this attack, he would be dead without a doubt.

But Bai Shuying’s sword suddenly stopped when it was two inches away from Lin Yun’s chest, and the mighty gale created by this attack sent Chen Feng flying away, while throwing out a mouthful of blood. He had to take several steps back before he could stabilize himself.

The sword vibrated, and the vibration sent a piercing pain into everyone’s eardrums. Bai Shuying furrowed her brows, and ripples spread within her heart. If Ye Qingtian wrote the letter to Zhang Yue, she wouldn’t hesitate to kill him, even if her master stopped her. But if he didn’t write it, Bai Shuying didn’t want to commit unnecessarily killing, even if his reputation was notorious within the Heavenly Dao Sect.

She swung out two swords wanting to prove that Ye Qingtian was shameless to slap his face, but she failed because Ye Qingtian didn’t try to dodge her sword at all.

“I knew you were unwilling to kill me,” Lin Yun smiled.

His shamelessness had successfully enraged Bai Shuying, and she thrust her sword forth. But the moment she thrust forth, she immediately regretted it because it was against her intention to kill Ye Qingtian. Taking another innocent life out of rage would create a flaw in her heart as a swordsman. After all, Ye Qingtian didn’t do anything, and she shouldn’t kill him because of it.

Her sword easily pierced Ye Qingtian, making Bai Shuying narrow her eyes. But she soon realized that she had only stabbed an afterimage, and Ye Qingtian had successfully dodged her attack.

This made Bai Shuying heave a sigh of relief, and she wasn’t furious anymore while looking at Ye Qingtian’s face. She suddenly realized it wasn’t worth it to become angry at someone as shameless as Ye Qingtian.

“Heh. Didn’t Ye Qingtian say that he won’t dodge? Why did he dodge in the end? It turns out that he’s a coward.”

“He’s just shameless, so why are you wasting time with him? Or do you really believe that he won’t dodge the attack?”

“Someone like him wants to pursue Senior Sister Bai? Did he look at himself in the mirror?” The crowd in the surrounding area mocked Lin Yun.

Bai Shuying didn’t make things difficult for Lin Yun, and said, “Ye Qingtian, I won’t kill you since you have taken an oath. But you better not repeat those shameless words. It’s right for you to dodge, and there’s nothing wrong with fearing death. After all, everyone can only live once.”

But surprisingly, Lin Yun wore a gentle smile as he replied, “I’m not afraid of death. I dodged because I noticed a wisp of regret and heartache in Senior Sister’s eyes. I naturally don’t think that it’s because you can’t bear to kill me, and I know it’s because you’re kind.”

Bai Shuying was stumped when she heard what Lin Yun said. After all, he was completely spot on, but how was that possible?

“It’s fine if I die, but I don’t want my death to affect Senior Sister’s heart as a swordsman and let Senior Sister live your life in regret. There are countless paintings in the world, but sadness can’t be painted. I don’t want to see you sad,” Lin Yun continued.

There are countless paintings in the world, but sadness can’t be painted? Bai Shuying was surprised.

Lin Yun stepped forth, casually plucking a flower from the side. Before Bai Shuying came to her senses, Lin Yun inserted that flower into her hair and smiled, “Someone as beautiful as Senior Sister shouldn’t be sad. If Senior Sister doesn’t like it, I won’t talk about it again in the future.”

When Bai Shuying came to her senses, Lin Yun backed down with a smile. But the surroundings were dead silent, and all the saint disciples were dumbfounded with their mouths wide open.

Even Ouyang He, who was amongst the crowd, was shocked as he looked at the flower on Bai Shuying’s head with disbelief. It was an ordinary flower, but it perfectly matched Bai Shuying’s elegant temperament.

Bai Shuying was the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden; no one had been so bold. After all, countless people tried to give her flowers in the past. Bai Shuying didn’t even take a glance, and none of them succeeded, regardless of how valuable the gifts were. But someone succeeded today, not to mention Bai Shuying wanted to kill Ye Qingtian just three minutes ago.

Chen Feng was also dumbfounded because this scene was too unbelievable.

“Perhaps this is a scumbag.” An envious voice resounded from the crowd, instantly sparking a rapport as everyone looked at Lin Yun, wanting to devour him whole.Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Ye Qingtian, you have become bolder in a year. In the past, you only dared to sneak around. But now, you actually dare to commit blasphemy to the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden in public!” Right then, Chen Jun and Ye Feifan walked over with the disciples of the Dao Yang Palace. As he spoke, Ye Feifan secretly pierced Lin Yun’s sea of consciousness with his martial intent.

But Lin Yun casually resolved the martial intent and said, “I might be bold, but I’m not bold enough to try and hurt someone with such a cowardly method.”

Ye Feifan was shocked when he saw this scene. Usn’t Ye Qingtian only at the third channel of the Profound Death Stage? But he managed to maintain his composure and said, “I only wanted to probe you after hearing that you grasped the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent.”

He ignored Ye Qingtian before coming to Bai Shuying, “I apologize that such a scumbag came from my Ye Clan. I will teach him a lesson today, and I guarantee that he won’t dare to be unruly towards you in the future.”

“Senior Sister Bai, Ye Qingtian is just a scumbag. If he’s not taught a lesson today, he’ll only take it further in the future,” Chen Jun agreed. Chen Jun and Ye Feifan were jealous of Ye Qingtian, especially Chen Jun, who had a crush on Bai Shuying.

But he didn’t dare stand out because he didn’t think he was worthy of Bai Shuying. So this was why he nearly went insane after seeing Ye Qingtian being so bold.

Bai Shuying quickly calmed down and said, “If I wanted to kill him, a sword is more than enough. I don’t need anyone helping me, and this matter has ended here.”

Chen Jun instantly became anxious that Bai Shuying would let Ye Qingtian go. But Ye Feifan gave a gentlemanly smile, “Since the holy maiden is so benevolent, I’ll let him off today.”

Seeing this, Chen Jun could only leave with Ye Feifan. He wasn’t Ye Qingtian’s opponent and didn’t dare to fight the latter even if he had the guts.

After everyone left, Chen Feng sighed in relief and said, “Phew. We’re lucky that Senior Sister is benevolent.”

Ye Feifan’s cultivation was at the fourth transformation of the Nirvana Stage, and he was a heaven-defying genius of the Ye Clan, stronger than Zhang Yue. If they really fought, who knew what the outcome would be? But he was so filled with admiration for Ye Qingtian that Bai Shuying let him off.

“Holy shit. Senior Brother, how did you manage to do that? Please teach it to me!” Chen Feng said with reverence on his face.

“You want to pursue the Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden?” Lin Yun asked with a smile.

“No… How can I possibly be worthy of the Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden?” Chen Feng quickly refuted.

Lin Yun merely wore a playful smile and said nothing else. When he looked at Bai Shuying’s figure, he couldn’t help feeling helpless because this woman was a time bomb. He knew that he wouldn’t be able to stay within the Heavenly Dao Sect any longer the moment a conflict occurred.

What happened today surprised him, and he nearly couldn’t carry on his act. He decided to stay away from Bai Shuying as much as possible, or his identity might be exposed one day.

Right then, the ground began to tremble as the gates to the Celestial Purging Mountain opened. The barrier enveloping the entire mountain disappeared as everyone immediately dashed forth.

“The Celestial Purging Mountain… I wonder what’s so special about this place that the Dragon Origin Great Saint mentioned it.” Lin Yun casually strolled up the mountain. The Dragon Origin Great Saint told him that he had to come here to achieve the Astral Sword Intent, and he was naturally filled with anticipation for the Celestial Purging Mountain.
