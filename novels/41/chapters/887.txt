Chapter 888 - Three Heavenly Rends

When Fang Shaoyu, Zhao Chen, and Zhu Qingshan saw Lin Yun coming back unscathed, they felt relieved.

At this moment, the youth who sold them the fortune cultivation technique smiled, “You guys just got here. I bet you don't have a place to stay, right? The best places in the cities are close to the statue, but they’re all occupied. If you guys don’t mind, you guys can stay in the Beaconfire Realm’s territory. After all, there’s a huge difference between the center and edge of the city.”

“Then we’ll thank you in advance.” Lin Yun didn’t refuse the offer and led Fang Shaoyu, Zhao Chen, and Zhu Qingshan into the Beaconfire Realm’s territory. Along the way, he told the trio what Qin Feng and Yan Kui told him.

The three fell silent. After a long time passed, Zhu Qingshan spoke up, “Can they be trusted? Why do I have a feeling that Feng Xuan was cannon fodder to them.”

The birthplace of the Glorysun Spirit was naturally filled with dangers. If the cannon fodder was used as scouts, it would definitely be safer for Qin Feng and Yan Kui.

“Perhaps.” Lin Yun didn’t refute what Zhu Qingshan said. He didn’t have a favorable opinion of Qin Feng and Yan Kui, especially since Yan Kui didn’t hold back when he assaulted him earlier. If he was slightly weaker, he would be dead right now.

Leaving a wound on Yan Kui’s palm was also a warning from Lin Yun. If Yan Kui really wanted to treat him as cannon fodder, the wound wouldn’t be so shallow next time. This only worked since both sides were making use of each other.CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

He needed strength if he wanted to speak to them as equals and not as an underling. If he wasn’t strong enough, he would naturally reject Qin Feng and Yan Kui’s request.

Fang Shaoyu pondered for a long time before he said, “Qin Feng seems to have hidden some crucial information like the location.”

“Judging by the current situation, only those in the first soul Heavenly Soul Realm know the location. It’s natural that they hid it from me when we’ve only just met. Plus, I don’t trust him,” said Lin Yun calmly.

There were hundreds and thousands of intermediate realms in Glorysun Land. Someone like Feng Xuan might have a position in Thunderflame City, but he was a nobody in Glorysun Realm. Only those who had gone through the tribulation would have a place in Glorysun Land.

Lin Yun wasn’t in urgent need of the Glorysun Spirit. Instead, he was more interested in the Golden Lightflow Lamp because he could upgrade the Flower Burial Sword to a dao artifact with it. But what Qin Feng said was right. Many people were after the Golden Lightflow Lamp and they might even be stronger than Qin Feng and Yan Kui.

Lin Yun knew that his current sword wasn’t fast enough. As he squinted his eyes, cold light flashed through his pupils because he could cut everything in his path if he was strong enough. Although Glorysun Land was troublesome, it was just the beginning. What would he do when he faced the geniuses from the higher realms?

The Heavenly Path was a brutal place where you had to keep improving or else someone would catch up to you. If he wasn’t strong enough, it would be troublesome for him to face Yu Haotian again. When Lin Yun thought about Yu Haotian, he could feel his burden increasing.

I have to grasp the essence of the killing moves in the next seven days!

Two days later, the city was still brightly lit under the protection of the statue. Lin Yun was in the Beaconfire Realm’s territory and the spiritual energy was extremely dense. So much so that there was even a small spiritual lake at the back of Lin Yun’s courtyard.

The courtyard also had a cultivating chamber covered with spiritual runes and a massive field for practicing martial techniques. Seated in the chamber, Lin Yun sat on a mat with exhausted astral pellets around him. The rest of his astral pellets were shining brightly like fireflies in the air.

When Lin Yun opened his eyes, he let out a long sigh. He wasn’t in a hurry to practice the three killing moves, but to stabilize his Azure Firmament Sword Sutra and Iris Sword Sutra. After the sword sutras combined, his cultivation techniques had reached an unprecedented level of perfection.

Lin Yun could sense boundless energy now that the Iris Sword Sutra’s flaws were being complimented. The Iris Sword Sutra was terrifying since it had the potential of an overlord cultivation technique. With the improvements to his Iris Sword Sutra, his strength had a lot of potential.

Lin Yun couldn’t imagine the power he would have in the future. With his current strength, he might even be able to hurt a second soul Heavenly Soul Realm expert. However, if he unleashed that much power, his body might rip apart from the immense energy.

“My cultivation is still too low,” muttered Lin Yun. He might be able to face Qin Feng and Yan Kui with his sword sutras, but it would be difficult for him to face a second soul Heavenly Soul Realm. All he needed to do was reach the Heavenly Soul Realm, but he needed an astronomical sum of resources to get there.

Since he couldn’t reach the Heavenly Soul Realm anytime soon, all he could do was practice the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth forms of the Azure Firmament Thirteen Sword.

If he was aiming for lesser mastery, he was already there. But he wanted to grasp the true essence so that he could fully control the techniques as his killing moves.

Taking out a jade slip, Lin Yun placed it against his forehead and examined the forms once more. Back then, Jian Wuya gained insight from observing the Azure Firmament Tree and created the Azure Firmament Sword Sutra. For the killing moves to be domineering, the Azure Firmament Tree must have had unparalleled grace. But how did a tree manage to do it?

Putting the jade slip down, Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts because this wasn’t his first time trying to comprehend it. Although he had a vague answer, he couldn’t be sure if he was right. But after the Azure Firmament Sword Sutra combined with his Iris Sword Sutra, Lin Yun stopped his comprehension. Since the Azure Firmament Sword Sutra had combined with the Iris Sword Sutra, it was naturally no longer the same sword technique Senior Jian Wuya created.

If he wanted to comprehend the three moves, he would have to include the Iris Sword Sutra. Otherwise, the combination would have been pointless. Lin Yun thought about the killing moves - Lightning Cocoon, Azure Lotus, and Solaris Lunar.

Forms 10 to 12 were powerful attacks that were worthy of being called killing moves. The Lightning Cocoon refined the thunderstorm sword energy into mist and silk. The silk was extremely sharp and could be used to kill without spilling a single droplet of blood.

The Azure Lotus had thunderstorm sword energy in each droplet of rain. When the rain formed a lake, leaves from the Azure Firmament Tree would bloom into lotuses.

As for the twelfth form, it was even more terrifying because Senior Jian Wuya personally witnessed the Azure Firmament Tree’s phenomenon. The thunderstorm manifested into a sun and a moon. Specifically, the sun was created by the wind and the moon was created by lightning. There was no question that this move was even stronger than the Supreme Dominance and Terranean Destruction.

Naturally, the 12th form surpassed the Overlord Sword and Dustlight Sword Art. However, Lin Yun had no idea what path he was on. He naturally couldn’t accept leaving his Iris Sword Sutra by the side.

“Iris Flowers blooming on the Azure Firmament Tree…” Lin Yun muttered as he held onto the jade slip firmly. Just like that, Lin Yun stayed in the chamber like a statue for three days as he tried comprehending the technique.

Suddenly, Lin Yun laughed because he had figured it out. His bloodshot eyes shined brightly with excitement written on his face, “Haha! Iris Flowers blooming on the Azure Firmament Tree! They cut down everything in the world. That’s my path! That’s the path that I’ve been pursuing! A path that cuts down everything that stands in my way!”

After three days, he finally figured out how to fuse the Azure Firmament Three and Iris Sword Stura. He would be able to fuse the three moves and immortal sword intent. The three forms created by Senior Jian Wuya were powerful enough and there was no need for him to alter them. He just had to fuse his path and heart as a swordsman into them.

“Since the new three killing moves are compatible with my Iris Sword Sutra, they should have new names.” Lin Yun muttered while he pondered briefly, “I’ll call them the Three Heavenly Divides then!”

He was determined to make the Three Heavenly Divides shine brightly in the Glorysun Land so their names would spread throughout the Heavenly Path. At that time, he would show his radiance to everyone.
