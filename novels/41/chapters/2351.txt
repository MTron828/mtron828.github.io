Chapter 2352 - Flower Burial Is Here!

Lin Yun’s smile shocked everyone.

“No... you can’t do this...” The six felt despaired as they were forced to a dead-end and even begged for mercy, but Lin Yun wouldn’t let them off.

“Let’s go!”

“We can just perish with him in the worst-case scenario!” Seeing that Lin Yun had no intentions of letting them go, the six kneeling on the ground felt despair, with a ruthless light flashing in their eyes, wanting to explode their golden pills.

“Wanting to perish with me? Dream on!” Lin Yun hovered in the air and swung his sword down along with nine thousand ribbons, shattering their saint energy and armor.

They all possessed treasures that could protect their lives, but they were futile before his sword. Regardless of the secret treasures or saint armors, they were all futile before Lin Yun’s sword.

The Quasi-Bright Sun Sword Intent was powerful enough. With the addition of the nine thousand ribbons engraved with divine runes, two sword canons, and sword domain, the six were sent flying away before they could even explode their golden pills, smashing their knees apart.

When they fell onto their knees, they raised their heads and saw the ribbons fly over, before piercing through them. The ribbons returned with six saint origins, which shocked everyone, including the swordsmen that came with Lin Yun.

Although they chanted the slogan to kill the divine dogs, they wouldn’t be able to make the move if they had to do it. They thought that Lin Yun wouldn’t make a move when they begged for mercy. But it was different for Lin Yun. If it weren’t for the rules on the Heavenly Barren Saint Mountain, Lin Yun would’ve killed them, based on his temper.

But it looks like ripping their saint origin was better than killing them. In the future, these people from the Divine Clans could only become cripples.

The area around the Deity Slaughter Monument was a mess with six people having their saint origins ripped out and kneeling on the ground. In the history of the Heavenly Barren Saint Mountain, this had never happened before, so Lin Yun brought a great shock to everyone.

“He’s too strong. Is this the power of the Quasi-Bright Sun Sword Intent? It’s really terrifying...”

“With Lin Yun’s strength, I’m afraid he can make it into the top hundredth on the Brandished Dragon Ranking. He’s only a sixth-stage Saint Lord, but if he could grasp primordial aura, he might reach the top thirty.”

“The Brandished Dragon Ranking covers three thousand realms. There are many immortal holy lands, and he has just come out of theKunlun Realm.”

Lin Yun descended from the sky as the nine thousand ribbons returned to his body. When he swept his gaze over, those from the Divine Clans didn’t dare to say a word. He merely smiled and said nothing but pointed with his finger. The Flower Burial Sword flew out and left his name behind on the Deity Slaughter Monument.

“Quick, Lin Yun is going to leave his name!”

“I'm looking forward to this. I wonder how high he can reach.” Everyone’s eyes lit up with anticipation. But it didn’t take long before Lin Yun felt an obstruction and Ao Jue, Ji Zixi, Lin Jiangxian, and Xioing Tiannan approached Lin Yun.

“How high do you want to reach?” Ao Jue asked curiously. What Lin Yun did earlier had won him over, and proved that he was a genuine swordsman.

“No idea.” Lin Yun wasn’t bothered about it and released his Quasi-Bright Sun Sword Intent to speed up the Flower Burial Sword. He soon left behind his name, Flower Burial Lin Yun, on the Deity Slaughter Monument. If willing, he could write his name even higher, but it didn’t matter because he had exhausted most of his saint energy and sword intent. He spoke the truth because he wasn’t too bothered about the ranking.

But when he wrote his name, the Deity Slaughter Monument began to tremble violently and released a golden radiance that soared to the sky. It didn’t take long before nine golden lights bloomed and three golden fruits descended.

Lin Yun’s eyes lit up because he needed resources. Ever since coming to the Heavenly Barren Realm, his cultivation soared and obtained an unimaginable harvest, practically exhausting all his resources.

“Primordial aura?” Lin Yun looked at the three fruits and could sense the dense primordial aura within the fruits. This naturally made him rejoice because he knew that these were treasures.

“This is what you said about no idea?” Ao Jue’s lips twitched, and he bitterly looked at Lin Yun. “You made golden lights appear by writing casually, so what would others think? After all, you are a genius!”

“Who is the other one?”

“Shangguan Jue!”

Lin Yun shook his head, and said, “But what does it have to do with me? What are these?”

He looked at Lin Jiangxian, a chief disciple of the Azure Cloud Realm.

“They’re Flame Origin Pellets, and the primordial aura inside has been tempered through tribulation. To a seventh-stage Saint Lord, the value is unimaginable,” Lin Jiangxian said. “Just one can be sold for a sky-high price in an auction.”

“That’s great.” Lin Yun smiled. While Lin Yun was chatting, he had no idea of the commotion he caused. Not only did he dig out seven saint origins, but he even seized three Flame Origin Pellets. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Holy shit, isn’t that a little too unfathomable!”

“The Heavenly Barren Realm has Flame Origin Pellets, and they’re all refined by the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity.”

“What would Shangguan Jue think?”

Anyone could tell that Lin Yun didn’t use his full strength. If he wanted to use his full strength, he would have to rest for four hours to recover. But now, Lin Yun casually wrote on the monument after a fight. They had to admit that Lin Yun was charming, and many female cultivators looked at Lin Yun with their eyes shining brightly.

More cultivators began to try to leave their names behind. Without the Divine Clans around, everyone smoothly managed to leave their names on the monument.

Xiong Tiannan joked with a smile, “Brother Lin, I didn’t notice your temper earlier. Holy shit. I apologize for my arrogance from before!”

“I like you being arrogant more,” Lin Yun smiled.

“Hahaha! Let me recover a little!” Xiong Tiannan laughed after a brief stun. When they first met, Xiong Tiannan was arrogant and disregarded everything. But he wasn’t a bad person and never crossed Lin Yun’s bottom line, so they could be considered friends now.

“Hahaha! Brother Lin, if the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity doesn’t accept you, you can come to my sect. Your temper is befitting of the demonic path!” Ao Jue grinned.

“I have a good temper,” Lin Yun smiled.

Ao Jue’s lips began to twitch. Good temper? Since when did Lin Yun have a good temper? Anyhow, those from the Divine Clans definitely didn’t dare to say a word about it.

Lin Jiangxian looked at Lin Yun, and thought that he was a real mystery. Even many demonic cultivators couldn’t be as decisive as him. But when Chang Jue and Xi Ruo offended him, she didn’t see Lin Yun making a move against them.

“I believe in Young Master Lin,” Lin Jiangxian said.

Lin Yun smiled, “See? I have a good temper.”

Ao Jue turned to look at Lin Jiangxian. He could sense that Lin Jiangxian’s gaze at Lin Yun wasn’t right. Very quickly, Lin Jiangxian, Ao Jue, Ji Zixi, and Xiong Tiannan left their names on the Deity Slaughter Monument.

When they tried, they finally knew how strong Lin Yun was. Even Lin Jiangxian and Ji Zixi only obtained two Flame Origin Pellets. After leaving their names on the monument, they gathered around Lin Yun, attracting countless respectful gazes. This group had become famous, especially Lin Yun, who won everyone’s respect through strength.

“It’s too hard, and I gave it my all to obtain a Flame Origin Pellet.” Xiong Tiannan looked at Lin Yun, then continued, “Your casual attempt is really shocking.”

“It’s really hard, and this Deity Slaughter Monument isn’t simple,” Lin Jiangxian said.

Ji Zixi muttered, “This monument couldn't have killed a deity, right? I can sense a murderous intent coming from it, and even my phoenix bloodline shows a hint of fear.”

She could actually leave her name higher, but her phoenix bloodline was suppressed to the point that even her soul felt fear. She suspected that this monument not only killed a deity in the past but also primordial beasts, especially those possessing divine bloodlines.

Hearing what they said, Lin Yun couldn’t help looking at the monument with curiosity. This monument probably had a considerable origin. It would be great if Lil’ Red was around because it wasn’t afraid of anything, and it might try and steal this Deity Slaughter Monument. With it around and Lil’ Purple’s planning, they might be able to steal this monument. At the very least, it should be on the same level as Sovereign Saint Artifacts, right?

“What are you thinking about?” Ji Zixi asked.

Lin Yun awkwardly smiled and brushed these thoughts away. He led everyone forth, and said, “Let’s go and participate in the second stage of the test. I’m curious about what the test will entail...”

The first test was held at the waist of the mountain, and the second test was two-thirds up the mountain. The saint energy here was dense, filled with various dao rhythms, as though a deity was observing their actions.

When everyone arrived at the second stage of the test, many people had gathered. They were tge geniuses who had long passed the first stage of the test.

“Lin Yun is here!”

“He’s Flower Burial?”

“That fellow is pretty dashing...” Lin Yun’s appearance attracted attention as everyone looked over and saw some commotion. The geniuses who made it through the first stage of the test had witnessed how Lin Yun dug out the saint origin of the Seven Divine Clans’ geniuses, which brought them great shock. Then again, some looked at Lin Yun with hostility.
