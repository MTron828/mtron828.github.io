Chapter 1201 - Trump Card, Seven Flowers!

The power of the Azure Dragon Sword Array was simply too strong, and it far exceeded everyone’s expectations. Although Lin Yun was strong, especially after his performance in the first round, he was being pushed back after three moves.

“Heavenly Azure Dragon!” The middle-aged man released a ferocious roar as the entire Azure Dragon Sword Array turned illusory. Then, the Azure Dragon soared into the sky and coiled around Lin Yun like a giant snake.

With the middle-aged man charging over, Lin Yun calmly executed the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords that were empowered by his quasi-divine firmament sword intent.

As the swords clashed, Lin Yun found himself in an unfavorable position even though his attainment in the sword was a lot stronger than his opponent’s. Furthermore, he was facing a combined force of over 300 people. Against this formation, it was natural that the attacks of the Azure Dragon Sword Array were unbelievably powerful.

At the same time, the Azure Dragon that was coiled around Lin Yun was constantly suppressing Lin Yun’s sword aura. So the 11 Azure Birds that surrounded him were constantly under attack.

The Azure Dragon Sword Array was a lot stronger than the Hundred Ghost Sword Array. The Hundred Ghost Sword Array was a vicious method of destroying a swordsman. However, the Azure Dragon Sword Array overwhelmed the challenger with sheer might.

The situation became more dangerous for Lin Yun as time passed. The middle-aged man was constantly putting him under pressure while the other swordsmen were weakening his sword aura. If he didn’t do anything soon, he could easily collapse from all the pressure.

Lin Yun was focused on trying to find the flaw of the array. And after fighting for a long time, he noticed several flaws. Unfortunately, none of them were critical flaws.

A few of the flaws were purposely revealed by the middle-aged man as a trap. It gave Lin Yun a big headache because he wasn’t sure what he should do. Suddenly, the Azure Birds were giving off sharp cries in the sky. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“I can’t find any real flaw, but I can’t hold out any longer.” Lin Yun knew that he couldn’t let the fight drag on because he would die if even one of the Azure Birds died.

“You think you can leave?” The middle-aged man sneered, “Stay behind!”

A gigantic dragon claw enveloped in lightning and wind tore suddenly headed towards Lin Yun. Pushing the Golden Crow Nine Transformations to the limit, Lin Yun did his best to get out of the way.

Although Lin Yun managed to avoid the attack at the very last moment, he suffered several heavy injuries to his body. The claw was formed by 49 swordsmen, and each swordsman unleashed nine sword rays. It was the equivalent of hundreds of attacks.

“Kill!” The middle-aged man said coldly as he poured his sword aura into his sword. Before Lin Yun could check his injuries, another claw flew towards him.

Lin Yun continued to brandish his sword to avoid the attack, but he received more injuries when he did this. From a certain perspective, the Azure Dragon Sword Array was even more troublesome than facing a genuine Azure Dragon.

Not giving Lin Yun the chance to catch his breath, the middle-aged man soared into the sky with his sword covered in lightning flames. When he swung his sword out, it looked like an Azure Dragon’s dragon breath.

Just like that, the lightning flames scorched the entire sky black, shocking everyone in the crowd. However, Lin Yun was prepared for the attack and managed to block the sword.

Even so, the impact made his hand feel numb as blood dripped down from his palm. It was so bad that he nearly lost his sword in the exchange.

“Lin Yun is going to lose!” Zhao Yan wore a grave expression. If this continued, Lin Yun was doomed to fail. Clearly, the Azure Dragon Sword Array was a little too terrifying.

“This fellow’s physique isn’t simple…” Gong Haoran, who wasn’t friendly toward Lin Yun, also spoke with a complicated expression. If he was in Lin Yun’s position, he would have been torn into pieces after four rounds. The fact that Lin Yun only suffered some injuries was proof that his physique was strong. But even so, he didn’t think that Lin Yun could change the outcome.

A loud explosion filled the air as one of Lin Yun’s Azure Birds was destroyed. Suddenly, the rest of the Azure Birds shattered and Lin Yun’s sword aura hit rock bottom.

The crowd held their breath because Lin Yun’s quasi-divine firmament sword intent couldn’t even get the job done. Although his extraordinary attainment in the sword allowed him to easily face monstrous geniuses on the empyrean ranking, it wasn’t enough to face the Azure Dragon Sword Aura.

When the Azure Birds crumbled, Lin Yun was sent flying by the middle-aged man and spit up blood everywhere.

“Kill!” After the middle-aged man sent Lin Yun flying away, he immediately collected himself and charged over.

The Grand Elder of Feng Clan could feel his heart beating wildly as he witnessed this scene. After all, he felt greatly embarrassed by Lin Yun. However, he didn’t dare to relax even though Lin Yun was stuck.

Feng Xuanzi’s eyes were also full of excitement as he couldn't help clenching his fist in victory.

“Hovering Sun!” Lin Yun, who was sent flying, didn’t have any changes in his expression. He executed the Golden Crow Nine Transformations to put some distance between himself and the middle-aged man. At the same time, he sighed because he still hadn’t found the flaw of the array.

The only method he had left was breaking through the array with force.

“Are you done resisting?” The middle-aged man sneered. “It doesn’t matter, you still have to die!”

As the array was about to kill Lin Yun, a dragon roar echoed out of his body. At the same time, a dragon-shaped sword aura flew out from his body with wind and lightning intent.

At this moment, he had perfectly fused his quasi-divine firmament sword intent and azure dragon aura together to form a shocking Azure Dragon Sword Aura. As Lin Yun released a roar, he raised his sword and charged over.

Everyone was completely dumbfounded by this scene as another Azure Dragon appeared out of nowhere. The middle-aged man was also shocked as he said, “Azure Dragon Sword Aura?”

When the quasi-divine firmament sword intent and azure dragon aura merged together, Lin Yun’s sword aura returned to its peak power. Wiping the blood off his lips, Lin Yun smiled, “My turn?”

Although he was smiling, his expression was cold. His opponents bullied him and relied on the Azure Dragon Sword Array. If it wasn’t for his strong physique, he would have died. So it was time to make them pay.

“Hmph! So what if you also possess the Azure Dragon Sword Aura? The Azure Dragon Sword Array isn’t as simple as you think!” The middle-aged man immediately calmed himself down and looked at Lin Yun coldly.

“Is that so?” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly and 49 Demonic Astral Flowers began to blaze in his aura oceans.

When the Demonic Astral Flowers ignited, a terrifying pressure swept out of Lin Yun’s body as he broke through the shackles of the Heavenly Soul Realm. With the pressure of an empyrean, Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon Sword Aura overwhelmed the array.
