Chapter 1145 - Bloodflame Dragon Runic Metal

Ye Ziling’s aura had already reached its peak as she swung her sword at the python’s tail. She easily cut the python’s tail off, which made blood and scales rain down from the sky. However, the impact of the tail’s attack sent her flying backwards.

“Not good!” Ye Ziling’s face suddenly changed when she saw the direction that the Azure Python was escaping to.

The Azure Python was smart and chose to run where Lin Yun and Wang Yuruo were at. After all, the two of them were undoubtedly the weakest among the party, especially Wang Yuruo who didn’t have any experience.

The Azure Python was pierced in the heart. It was a fatal spot, so it was well covered with scales. However, Ye Ziling’s attacks were so ferocious that she destroyed the protection around the heart. Once this happened, the Azure Python lost all courage to fight and fled. After all, it was in a disadvantageous position to fight with Ye Ziling on land. Plus, her sky sword intent was a lot more terrifying than it thought it would be.

“Yuruo, watch out!” Ye Ziling’s face changed as she became nervous. Although the Azure Python had been heavily injured by her, it wasn’t something that Lin Yun and Wang Yuruo could face.

“Senior…” Wang Yuruo’s face had a deathly white color to it as the python charged toward her. She was speechless as fear overtook her body.

“Let’s go!” Lin Yun grabbed onto Wang Yuruo with a grave expression, but he didn’t have any panic on his face. Pushing the Azure Dragon Saint Art to the limit, purple-golden dragon runes appeared on his body as his hand turned into a dragon claw to push Wang Yuruo far away.

The Azure Python was quick, so it hit Lin Yun after he pushed Wang Yuruo away. Countless rocks shattered as Lin Yun crashed 10,000 meters away, leaving a huge cloud of dust in his path.

Ye Ziling managed to grab hold of Wang Yuruo, who was spinning in the sky. After Wang Yuruo calmed down, she cried out, “Senior Sister, help Senior Brother Yun!”

Ye Ziling looked in the Azure Python’s direction with a complicated gaze and disbelief. She couldn’t believe that Lin Yun, whom she felt was unpleasant, would save Wang Yuruo by taking the Azure Python’s attack head-on.

“Senior Sister, Senior Brother Yun… he…” Liu Yuan’s face also changed as he rushed over. He wanted to say that Lin Yun was probably dead under the Azure Python’s attack, but he didn’t know how to say it.

“Take care of her.” Ye Ziling said with a cold light flashing through her eyes. If anything happened to Lin Yun, she would definitely make the Azure Python pay the price. But all of a sudden, she felt a terrifying sword aura shining through the cloud of dust.

“The Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords?” Ye Ziling’s expression turned serious as a terrifying aura swept out from Lin Yun, instantly enveloping this entire region.

First Sword—Sun Concealing Clouds!

A dazzling sword ray exploded and enveloped the entire sky, causing Ye Ziling to widen her eyes in disbelief. She could sense a terrifying aura coming from the sword aura that was charging towards the Azure Python.

When the sword aura spread out, the Azure Python felt threatened. Even though it was injured, it couldn’t believe that a mere ant in the Heavenly Soul Realm could make it feel threatened. The Azure Python roared because it wanted to kill Lin Yun and destroy his sword aura.

As the Azure Python unleashed a terrifying aura, its remaining azure scales began to flicker. Then, it coiled around Lin Yun, which trapped the sword aura. However, when the sword aura landed on the Azure Python's body, the blazing sword intent instantly melted the Azure Python’s scales. It was a sky sword intent that was even more terrifying than Ye Ziling’s sky sword intent. Plus, Lin Yun’s Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords was also a lot stronger.

Lin Yun’s sword went straight into the Azure Python’s body, causing the Azure Python to let out a painful howl as it charged toward Lin Yun.

Lin Yun retreated as he prepared to unleash the second sword of the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords. Then, he created a huge gash on the Azure Python’s body.

The Azure Python initially wanted to bite onto Lin Yun, but Lin Yun unleashed a barrage of attacks that prevented it from proceeding.

If the Azure Python wasn’t injured by Ye Ziling, Lin Yun would already be dead. So he didn’t dare to be careless and unleashed nine swords in a single breath. Lin Yun was tiny compared to the Azure Python, but his sword aura was like a colossal mountain that suppressed the Azure Python’s aura.

After he swung the ninth sword, the Azure Python laid on the ground with sinister wounds.

“Is it dead?” Lin Yun landed on the ground and gasped for air as his forehead was covered in sweat. It was taxing for him to unleash nine swords in a row, especially under the condition that he was already injured. This made Lin Yun throw up a mouthful of blood as his face turned pale.

The python started to struggle again, trying to get back up. But all of a sudden, a sword ray flew over and stabbed into the lower jaw of the Azure Python, pinning it into the ground.

The Azure Python wailed once more before collapsing. No matter how much it struggled, it couldn’t get up.

When Ye Ziling landed on the ground next to the python, she looked at Lin Yun for a long time and fell silent. After all, it was a little too shocking even for her that Lin Yun had brought the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords to the manifestation stage, not to mention that he also grasped the sky sword intent.

Wiping the blood off his lips, Lin Yun winked and smiled, “Senior Sister, why are you looking at me like that? Have you fallen for me?”

Ye Ziling recovered from her shock before rage filled her face. However, recalling how Lin Yun chose to save Wang Yuruo earlier without any hesitation, she became gentle once more. “The champion of the Ninth Heavenly Path is truly terrifying. I’m just curious about all the secrets you’re hiding.”

As she spoke, she stepped forward to help Lin Yun. However, she noticed that his injuries weren’t serious. She couldn’t help looking at Lin Yun once more in disbelief. Although the Azure Python was already injured, it was still unbelievable that Lin Yun managed to take an attack head-on and only suffer light injuries, “You barely have any injuries despite taking the attack head-on…”

“I’m just lucky,” smiled Lin Yun. He was indeed lucky because the Azure Python had underestimated him, not to mention that he had reached the fifth stage in the Azure Dragon Saint Art recently and was only one stage away from reaching the Azure Dragon Saint Physique.

This enabled him to possess a powerful physique because the purple-golden dragon runes reached a shocking number of nearly 70. Even without the Azure Dragon True Bone or Azure True Dragon Saint Armor, his defense wasn’t bad.

“Lin Yun?” Liu Yuan and the rest rushed over and were shocked to see that Lin Yun was still alive.

“Wuuuuu! Senior Brother Yun!” Wang Yuruo sobbed before she threw herself into Lin Yun’s embrace.

“Senior Brother Yun, I’m sorry! I thought that you didn’t care about me earlier and I was angry! Wuuu, I was really afraid that I wouldn’t be able to see you again.” Wang Yuruo sobbed while she was in Lin Yun’s embrace, causing Feng Zhang and the other core disciples’ lips to twitch. However, Ye Ziling didn’t reprimand Wang Yuruo for her actions this time.

“Senior Sister, is the Azure Python dead?” Liu Yuan looked at the colossal Azure Python lying on the ground covered in terrifying wounds with a portion of its scales melted. When he saw the python, the thought of Lin Yun damaging the python never crossed his mind. He thought that Ye Ziling put in all the work. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

After all, who could imagine that someone in the Heavenly Soul Realm could put the Azure Python in this state? However, Lin Yun didn’t want the credit and Ye Ziling wasn’t going to reveal Lin Yun’s secrets.

“It’s not dead yet.” Ye Ziling’s eyes flashed coldly as she walked toward the Azure Python.

Meanwhile, Lin Yun finished comforting Wang Yuruo and followed behind Ye Ziling. He was also curious why the Azure Python was in the stone forest. There had to be something precious since a monarch demonic beast was present.

“Speak!” Ye Ziling said coldly.

The Azure Python opened its eyes slowly before it spoke with a hiss, “The origin stone of Blood Flame Dragon Rune Gold will be born seven days from now. At the very least, it will be a saint origin stone!”

Everyone’s hearts throbbed violently because they didn’t expect to hear such shocking news. Ye Ziling waved her hand to summon her sword back.

Then, the Azure Python crawled away while speaking, “I admit my defeat today in your hands…”

But before the Azure Python could finish, a sword ray flashed from Ye Ziling. She decapitated the Azure Python. The Azure Python’s eyes were wide open because it never expected that Ye Ziling would be so decisive.

“You lied to me…” The Azure Python hissed from its decapitated head.

As Ye Ziling sheathed her sword, her eyes flashed with mockery, “You think I don’t know what you’re thinking? Why should I keep you alive to take revenge on the disciples of my Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect? As a monarch demonic beast, are you really that naive?”

Even the party from the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect was shocked by how decisive Ye Ziling was. However, Lin Yun was the only one to smile. He now knew why he didn’t hate Ye Ziling right from the beginning. She had a temperament that he liked, a heroic demeanor fitting of a swordsman.
