Chapter 610 - Azure Dragon Enneaform

Once again, Lin Yun destroyed Guo Xu’s attack with another spear. Lin Yun couldn’t use his sword, so he was using the spear as a replacement. However, Lin Yun was proving to be even tougher to deal with than before.

This startled Guo Xu and shock filled his face. Before he could even think clearly, he quickly retreated. When he landed on the ground, he took several steps back before he managed to stabilize himself.

Although he wasn’t injured, he was in a disadvantageous position. At this moment, his face soured.

“Guo Xu, is this all you have?” Lin Yun asked as he pointed the spear at Guo Xu.

“Since you want to die, then I’ll fulfil your wish!” Guo Xu was thoroughly enraged and he unleashed all his power. With a roar, lightning and flames exploded on his body as he chopped down with his palm.

His chop instantly created a gale in the hall as the crackling lightning illuminated the hall in purple. As cracks spread out on the ground, Lin Yun stabbed the spear into the ground and threw a punch.

In the next second, thirty cauldrons worth of strength burst out and saintly music echoed in the hall. The collision exploded as the lightning spread out.

In mid-air, Guo Xu pushed out with both his palms as the scattered lightning formed spears that shot towards Lin Yun. When Lin Yun landed on the ground, he gathered the dracophant energy within his body to condense it into armor.

The armor looked like it was forged with golden purple metal with an ancient dracophant engraved on it. This armor itself was comparable to the defence of a mid grade cosmic artifact. When the spears came in contact with the armor, purple sparks flew but Lin Yun was unharmed.

Looking at the unharmed Lin Yun, Guo Xu frowned his brows as rage flashed in his pupils. He never imagined that Lin Yun would be so powerful without his sword. Not only did his strength reach thirty cauldrons, but he even grasped a technique that could condense armor on his body. But that didn’t affect Guo Xu’s resolution to kill Lin Yun.

“Thunderbolt—Lightning Quake!” Guo Xu roared as he unleashed his full power in the pinnacle Yang stage. When he threw his punch out, the lightning around him condensed into a python that instantly devoured Lin Yun.

Omnipresent Anger, Raging Sky!

But before the lightning python could land, Lin Yun threw his punch that contained his boiling killing aura and instantly tore the python apart.

“Lightning Dragon Claw!” Guo Xu roared as he formed a claw with his hand and reached out at Lin Yun.

When the draconic claw landed on Lin Yun’s armor, it left five ferocious marks. Even the Dracophant War Armor’s aura was weakened by the claw.

Looking at this scene, Guo Xu smirked, “Thunder Roar, Imprisoning Dragon!”

Before Lin Yun could stabilize his footing, the scattered lighting came together again and coiled around Lin Yun. In the blink of an eye, it had formed into a chain that bound Lin Yun tightly.

Guo Xu gasped for his breath as he had exhausted a great deal of his energy in this fight. But his eyes flashed with a sinister glow as he threw a punch out at Lin Yun, “You really think that my ranking is for naught?!”

He was confident of taking Lin Yun out with his attack. But before his punch could reach Lin Yun, the chains that bound onto Lin Yun broke into pieces. When Lin Yun’s figure reappeared, his armor had shattered with traces of blood dripping down from his lips.

“You’re not dead? You’re really troublesome. But since you dared to compete with me, then you’ll have to die!” Guo Xu’s face sank as his fist crackled with lightning once more.

“What an annoyance!” Lin Yun grabbed onto the spear and his gaze turned sharp.

Luminous Moon!

Before Guo Xu could avoid this attack, he was devoured by the moonlight radiance. Using the spear as a sword, waves of moonlight from Lin Yun’s spear crashed onto Guo Xu’s body that constantly weakened the lightning around him.

When Guo Xu landed on the ground, he threw up a mouthful of blood and his face turned extremely pale.

“Thunder Roar? I also have a thunderbolt-like sword that I’d like you to have a taste of!” Lin Yun began to release his sword intent and swung his spear. In the next second, his sword intent began to rumble like lightning.

Guo Xu’s previous attack also had the momentum of a thunderbolt, but Lin Yun’s attack was clearly more powerful. When Lin Yun stabbed the spear out, a silver bolt of lightning instantly filled every corner of the hall.

Before Guo Xu could get up on his feet, he was pierced by the sword on his chest and fresh blood flowed out.

He isn’t dead? Lin Yun wasn’t surprised by this since Guo Xu was an elite on the ranking. Raising his brow, Lin Yun stabbed the spear once again, which forced Guo Xu to cross his arms together to block the attack. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Lin Yun had put on a strong performance. He suddenly leaned backwards and whipped the spear out like a dragon, which sent Guo Xu flying. With his back about to lean against the wall, Lin Yun suddenly spun and stabbed out with the spear.

In a split second, Lin Yun’s spear covered Guo Xu with wounds. When Guo Xu landed on the ground, Lin Yun used the spear as a sword and unleashed a sword ray.

Guo Xu was slammed into the wall and the sounds of bones cracking could be heard. When he got back up on his feet, he quickly fled for his life without turning around.

Looking at Guo Xu, Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly, but he decided not to chase after the former. Right now, retrieving the jade slip was of the utmost importance. After all, it would be a great loss if the jade slip was taken by someone else when he chased after Guo Xu.

As for Guo Xu, Lin Yun no longer placed him in his eyes. He only exerted 60% of his strength with his spear, but it was more than enough to defeat Guo Xu. After taking a hit from his Thunderbolt Slash, Guo Xu no longer had the qualification to stay in the empyrean’s tomb. It would be a great fortune if he could return alive.

Letting out a long breath, Lin Yun turned around and looked at the jade slip with a composed expression. It was as though his battle with Guo Xu was just a small matter.

The lightning and the black dragon emitted a terrifying aura. When Lin Yun looked at the dragon, it felt like his soul was about to be devoured.

Appearing before the pillar with a flash, Lin Yun reached for the jade slip hovering on top of it. The moment he grabbed onto the jade slip, information flowed into his mind, “Azure Dragon Enneaform, an intermediate earth grade body-refining technique. In ancient times, a powerhouse created the Azure Dragon Art that consisted of sword technique, movement technique, cultivation technique, sword sutra, palm technique, fist technique, and many others.

“The Azure Dragon Enneaform was the body-refining technique portion of it. The azure dragon has control over the power of wind and lightning. This technique tempers the body with wind and lightning energy. This body-refining technique has a total of ten stages. The first two stages are the foundation. After the foundation is stabilized, one can execute the first transformation by empowering the body with wind and lightning energies. At the ninth stage, one can even condense the dragon’s breath!”

The highest stage of the Azure Dragon Enneaform could condense the dragon’s breath? Lin Yun’s face turned grave when he saw it. Dragons were legendary divine beasts, so Lin Yun didn’t feel that it was possible for humans to condense a dragon’s breath.

After all, many techniques had exaggerated introductions that claimed to be able to shatter the sun and moon upon reaching the highest stage. But the Azure Dragon Enneaform said that one could condense a dragon’s breath, which was very interesting. There was no question that the Azure Dragon Enneaform was a body-refining technique that Lin Yun needed. It was filled with temptation for him even without the last sentence.

However, if the last sentence was real, it would be a huge fortune for him. It didn’t seem impossible. It might be impossible for anyone to condense a dragon’s breath now, but it might have been possible in the golden era.

Putting that matter aside for now, Lin Yun wanted to see if he could practice it immediately. Guo Xu fought with him because he felt that he could practice immediately because it matched his lightning attributed cultivation technique.

But Lin Yun had the Dracophant Battle Physique, which might not be any inferior to Guo Xu’s compatibility.
