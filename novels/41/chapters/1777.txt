Chapter 1778 - Strongest Swordsmen on the Dragon Pulse Ranking

Yan Tie was so confident in himself that he didn’t even give Lin Yun a chance to speak and immediately unleashed his attack, drawing his sword. When sword rays flickered, his black sword rays were accompanied by a deathly aura that streaked across the air like lightning.

“Death Intent!”

“That’s the Death Sword Intent, one of the strongest sword intents one could grasp. It’s no wonder why he’s so confident.” An exclamation broke out from the crowd, and they looked at Yan Tie with shock.

Lin Yun avoided this sword ray, while sensing a similarity in the black sword ray with nether energy. The scent of death could corrode all lives, and Death Intent was hard to grasp. So it was even harder to merge it into one’s sword intent.

As ghostly wails resounded, two black sword rays turned into a violent storm that charged towards Lin Yun. The storm made his clothes and hair flutter in the wind before he thrust his sword forth twice.

When a loud explosion resounded, the two deadly storms shattered. The chaotic air current swept Yan Tie within it as he thrust his sword, unleashing a deadly storm with each sword.

Lin Yun was well aware of how terrifying the power of death was, and it would strike a significant blow to his dragon origin if he came in contact with it. The corrosiveness of it wasn’t something he could quickly recover from, even with the Blue Dragon Saint Physique. He knew that he had ran into a formidable foe now.

Most importantly, not only was Yan Tie’s cultivation at the ninth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, each of his dragon pulses were at two thousand eight hundred feet, which placed Lin Yun under tremendous pressure.

“Holy shit! His Death Sword Intent is really terrifying!”

“This Martial Dao Tea Party is exciting with crouching tigers and hidden dragons!”

“Lin Xiao is doomed!” 

Yan Tie held the upper hand, and this was everyone’s first time seeing Lin Yun suffering a loss. So they couldn’t help becoming excited.

“My sword dao is the path of slaughter, so don’t persevere if you can’t. I’m afraid that I’ll accidentally kill you.” Yan Tie said coldly, his pupils flickering with bloodlust like a ferocious beast staring at his prey.

“My sword dao is also the path of slaughter. If slaughtering cannot be avoided, I’ll use countless bones to forge my path. But slaughtering is only a means, and protecting the people I care about is the main purpose. No one can save anyone I want to kill, and no one can die if I don’t want to kill.” Lin Yun smiled. His voice wasn’t loud, but everyone could hear it clearly. Everyone could also sense the strong will within his tone.

“How arrogant!”

“These two are like needles; only a swordsman understands a swordsman best.”

“Why do I feel that Lin Xiao’s sword dao is on a higher level?”

“Tsk. Who doesn’t know how to brag?”

Lin Yun’s arrogant words had successfully angered Yan Tie. The latter smiled, “A sword is a weapon that can only shine with slaughter. Death is everyone’s ultimate belonging. Lin Xiao, your sword dao is too shallow. I will show you the true sword dao!”

As he spoke, he moved closer, and the deathly aura he gave off was like a blooming Netherflower. His sword ray swiftly cut through the thunderstorm and tried suppressing Lin Yun.

“I’m afraid you’ll have to be disappointed.” Lin Yun turned around, and an Azure Dragon appeared, coiling around him, forging an impenetrable defense.

“Ha. A stinky reptile.” Yan Tie was arrogant and suddenly reached out with his left hand. His hand looked like the hand of a death god, and he grabbed for the Azure Dragon’s neck. But he had obviously underestimated Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon Intent.

The moment he grabbed onto the Azure Dragon’s neck, he immediately felt something was amiss, and it felt like he was holding onto a real dragon. It wasn’t a phenomenon or illusion but a genuine dragon.

With a flick of his wrist, the Azure Dragon broke free from his grasp, and a sword ray swept over like a dragon’s tail.Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

This forced Yan Tie to retreat, but he was still caught within the attack. When his sword landed on the dragon’s tail, sparks flew around.

“What the hell is this? His Azure Dragon Intent is comparable to a myriad rune saint artifact or even stronger!” Yan Tie was puzzled. He initially thought that the azure dragon was a phenomenon or something created with dragon origin. He expected to be able to crush it easily with a gentle squeeze. He did not expect to suffer such a huge loss.

Yan Tie was surprised, and Lin Yun's shock wasn’t any weaker, either. At such a close distance, his opponent wasn’t injured and was merely sent flying away. Not to mention that he managed to block most of the dragon tail’s impact.

He already used seventy percent of his dragon origin, and his dragon pulses would appear if he continued. When that time comes, his tribulation would descend. He didn’t want to undergo his tribulation like this and didn’t want to disclose the secret of his dragon pulses.

“Azure Dragon Eyes!” Taking advantage of Yan Tie landing on the ground, Lin Yun soared to the sky, causing the sky to turn dark.

“This move is useless against me.” Yan Tie grinned. “Death Ray!”

His pupils shone like an abyss as a baleful aura exploded from his body. This made the already dim surroundings even darker. Everyone’s faces became pale with fright because they were horrified to discover the Thunderblood Battlestage was enveloped in darkness. Not only were they unable to see anything, but they couldn’t even sense anything with their perceptions.

This scene made Yue Weiwei, who was watching the battle from afar, feel her heart tighten, and she involuntarily clenched her fist. For some reason, Ye Ziling was also feeling a little anxious in her heart, which surprised her. She didn’t know where this anxiety came from. Looking around, she noticed everyone from the Sword Sect was as nervous as her.

In the darkness, Lin Yun calmly landed on the ground. The stage was as bright as day under his Sword Heart. Yan Tie couldn't win by relying on this trick. Closing his eyes, he blocked all the incoming attacks, which terrified Yan Tie. As they fought in the darkness, sparks flew around, along with the collision of swords.

This situation made everyone around the stage feel apprehensive with tension. Everyone here was a genius on the Dragon Pulse Ranking, but they were shocked because they had never expected such a scene before.

“Nine Heavenly Storm!”

“The Death Dance—Starfall!” The faces of the holy land geniuses changed. They could sense that there were two terrifying surges of power accumulating within the darkness.

“Not good!” The Autumn Mountain Lord stood up and quickly turned to the Dragon Pulse Ranking, “Senior Dragon Spirit, please make a move!”

His voice was abrupt, and they could see the ancient and mysterious Dragon Pulse Ranking emitting a majestic power before anyone could react. A blue light shone on the Thunderblood Battlestage. A loud explosion could be heard when the light enveloped the stage, and everyone felt their scalps go numb. Their eardrums were also on the verge of bursting.

While they were puzzled, a dazzling brilliance shone on the stage that was enveloping darkness, and the sudden outburst of light stung many people's eyes. If someone looked in this direction from beyond Thunder Island, they could only see a dazzling flash. This was because the two ultimate attacks from the two swordsmen clashed.

Without that light screen, it would create unimaginable destructive power that no one could imagine.

As the light gradually dissipated, everyone quickly looked at the stage but couldn’t find anyone. Everything happened too quickly, Yan Tie and Lin Yun had executed their movement techniques to the limit, so they could only see a blurred figure when their sword rays clashed.

Ten-odd moves later, Yan Tie let out a furious roar before he laughed, “Lin Xiao, take another sword from me!”

Death Dance—Waning Moon!

A waning black moon appeared on the horizon as Yan Tie hovered in mid-air. His Death Sword Intent was like a delicate flower as the black moon danced. But to the one facing this attack, it had reached an unbelievable speed as it flew over.

“Thunder Spike!” Lin Yun let out a roar as he raised the Flower Burial Sword to the sky. All the lightning spiritual energy in the world was being lured towards the sword, rushing towards the Flower Burial Sword.

As a strong gale exploded with lightning flickering, Lin Yun hovered in mid-air with his hair fluttering about. He had a determined gaze and summoned lightning with his sword. As boundless lightning poured into his sword, it ultimately formed into nine lightning shackles that enveloped the Flower Burial Sword. Each shackle was over a thousand feet long, like a massive dragon.

No one expected the battle between Yan Tie and Lin Yun to be so intense. Everyone held their breaths, forgetting the battle's outcome for a moment. They were all shocked by the attacks used between them. When Lin Yun and Yan Tie’s attacks clashed again, Yan Tie’s attack shattered, and he was sent flying away.

It didn’t feel good for Lin Yun either because he was caught by the deathly aura and some of his body was being corroded. But with the Blue Dragon Saint Physique, it wasn’t lethal, nor could it inflict any severe injuries on him. On the contrary, Yan Tie was the one who suffered greatly in this clash.

There were nine shackles entangling a sword. Not only did the nine shackles shatter the sword, but the waning moon in the sky as well, and this scene scared everyone. Could it be that even Yan Tie couldn’t be Lin Yun’s opponent?

While everyone was surprised, Yan Tie loudly laughed, “Death Dance—Netherflower!”

He tapped his foot in mid-air, and hovered in the sky as if he was standing on the water's surface. Every time he stepped, ripples would spread out beneath his foot. After he took nine steps, his Death Sword Intent reached a terrifying height. His sword gave off a feeling that it was invisible, but it was aslo everywhere simultaneously. It felt like death that couldn’t be avoided.

“What a powerful sword!”

“This isn’t a sword technique that belongs in the Dragon Pulse Realm. It’s too strong! There’s no trajectory at all, and it’s infinitely close to the profundity of death!”

“It’s the Netherflower! Yan Tie must’ve been to the Nether Sea! That fellow is insane. He actually went to the Nether Sea to practice the Death Sword Intent, not to mention that he found a Netherflower!”

“Lin Xiao’s earlier sword was too strong, but he won’t be able to catch his breath in time. I’m afraid he’s going to lose.”

“He’s too strong. But it’s a pity that he ran into Yan Tie!” No one was optimistic about Lin Yun, and even Ji Lingfeng lightly shook his head.

The battle between swordsmen was fascinating. Just a moment ago, Lin Yun still held the advantage, but he would lose now. It was brutal, but there was nothing he could do about it. That was the Death Sword Intent and the charm of swordsmen.

But Lin Yun’s pupils blazed with a wisp of fighting spirit. The corner of his lips rose, and no one expected him to smile. People laughed at him for being insane, but he laughed at others for being unable to see through him.

He executed the strongest sword form of the Azure Dragon Sword Art. He never expected to use it so soon, but Lin Yun didn’t think it was a pity because Yan Tie was worth it.

Trump cards were never meant to be hidden but used immediately. Only then could he improve and make it more powerful. In this sword, he perfectly fused his Thunderstorm Intent.

When he swung his sword out, the shackles left on Lin Yun by heaven and earth snapped. An unprecedented sense of freedom swept out from him, and his sword aura even created fine cracks on the light screen created by the dragon spirit. His sword ray was unbelievably dazzling.

“How is this possible?!” Yan Tie was horrified. Before he could even react, he felt a sharp pain in his chest.

The Flower Burial Sword cut through the Netherflower and pierced into his heart. This made Yan Tie widen his eyes with disbelief. His mouth widened, but he couldn’t utter a single word.

Everyone in the surroundings exclaimed, shocked to see Lin Yun killing Yan Tie. But the next moment, they were shocked to discover that Yan Tie wasn’t dead, and no sign of his life force was disappearing.

Circulating the Blue Dragon Saint Physique, blue light spread from his sword into Yan Tie’s body. As Yan Tie’s vitality grew stronger, he swiftly recovered from his injuries, and his pale face became rosy once more.

Time seemed to have stopped at this moment, and the corner of Yan Tie’s lips awkwardly twitched. He suddenly recalled what Lin Yun had said. No one can save anyone I want to kill, and no one can die if I don’t want to kill.

Wasn’t what happened now exactly what Lin Yun said? When he recalled what he said to Lin Yun before the fight, he couldn’t help feeling embarrassed and wished he could die because of it. But now, he couldn’t even die if he wanted because his injuries were fully recovered. But he knew he could die anytime if he dared to act recklessly.
