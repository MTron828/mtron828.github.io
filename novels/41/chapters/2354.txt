Chapter 2355 - You're Not Afraid, Right?

Lin Jiangxian’s group approached the grey-robed elder’s side and bowed before Ao Jue went first.

“Mhm?” The grey-robed elder was one of the thirty-six envoys from the Heaven’s Gate. He looked at Ao Jue, and his face changed, “Your lineage is also here...”

Ao Jue smiled, “I’m not the only one here, and I’m just a pawn.”

“You have the Divine Demonic Palace’s mark, so how can you be a pawn?” Profound Sky Venerable frowned.

Everyone was surprised because the Divine Demonic Palace was one of the core forces amongst the demonic sects, and their position wasn’t at all inferior to Heaven’s Gate.

Ao Jue smiled but said nothing.

But just when Profound Sky Venerable was about to close his eyes, his gaze fell onto Lin Jiangxian. He could sense a deity’s mark on Lin Jiangxian, so he said, “You’re a divine disciple of the Heavenly Sword Pavilion?” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“I’m only the chief disciple of a branch, not a divine disciple,” Lin Jiangxian smiled. She wasn’t publicly known as a divine disciple, but her identity was a little special.

“Carry on trying to fool me.” Profound Sky Venerable was furious because Ao Jue had tried to fool him earlier, saying that he was a pawn.

Profound Sky Venerable looked at Xiong Tiannan, who grinned, “Don’t look at me. I’m just a tomb raider.”

Profound Sky Venerable coldly said, “Your lineage has a lot of tomb raiders, and I advise you to throw away your thoughts. Even if you make it through this test, the ancestral deity won’t accept your lineage as his disciple.”

“Haha, I’m just here to join the fun. I didn’t expect to walk far, and I probably can’t make it through this stage,” Xiong Tiannan smiled.

“Go on.” The Profound Sky Venerable said. But when he looked at Ji Zixi, his facial expression became serious. He smiled, “A Heavenly Phoenix Maiden, how rare... I now realize that none of you has a small background.”

“It’s nothing. I’m just a small girl from a barbaric land,” Ji Zixi smiled.

“I know your lineage. Your lineage will come here every time, but all of them failed. Lass, you have to bear a huge burden,” the Profound Sky Venerable said.

“I will do my best,” Ji Zixi kept her smile.

“You’re young, not to mention that you’re a Heavenly Phoenix Maiden. If you can enter the Heavenly Barren Banquet, the ancestral deity will like you,” Profound Sky Venerable smiled.

Xiong Tiannan was unhappy with the blatant difference in treatment.

Ji Zixi’s eyes shone brightly, and she smiled, “I’ll thank Grandpa here, then.”

“Hahaha!” The Profound Sky Venerable laughed and let them ascend the cauldron with Ji Zixi being the last one. His words caused an uproar, with everyone’s gazes directed at the four. They could hear from Profound Sky Venerable that the four of them had huge origins, and no one else received the Profound Sky Venerable aside from Zhao Zhanli.

So after hearing what the Profound Sky Venerable said, especially with Ji Zixi, they instantly realized that no one around Lin Yun was simple.

Ao Jue participated in comprehending first, in which he smoothly found nine phenomena. This gave everyone a feeling that Ao Jue seemed to have suppressed himself.

When it was Xiong Tiannan’s turn, he looked nervous, then looked at Ji Zixi, “You can go first.”

Ji Zixi smiled, “Why are you so nervous? Alright, let me go then.”

Ji Zixi ascended the cauldron and briefly comprehended before opening her eyes with eighteen paintings appearing, shocking everyone.

“So fast!”

“It looks like the Heavenly Phoenix Maiden isn’t simple. Her phenomenon might not be as much as Zhao Zhanli, but she’s much faster.”

“She probably didn’t want to reveal too much of her strength. If she became serious, she might not be inferior to Zhao Zhanli.”

When it was Lin Jiangxian’s turn, her speed was slow as she comprehended for a long time.

“Senior Brother Zhao, she won’t surpass thirty-six, right...?” The disciples of the Shadow Divine Palace said nervously.

“What are you thinking about? How can a branch’s chief disciple be compared to me? It’s more understandable if the chief disciple of the Heavenly Sword Pavilion’s headquarters comes,” Zhao Zhanli said unhappily. But as soon as he was done, he was dumbfounded because fifty-six paintings appeared behind Lin Jiangxian.

When all the paintings disappeared, two Divine Dragon Destiny Pellets appeared from the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron, shocking everyone.

“Lin Jiangxian can’t really be a divine disciple for real, right?”

“As expected, the comprehension of someone who caught Profound Sky Venerable's eye can’t be simple.”

“This is really unbelievable. She even comprehended more than Zhao Zhanli.”

“It’s not surprising if she’s a divine disciple. The Heavenly Sword Pavilion is an immortal holy land, and their foundation isn’t inferior to the Shadow Divine Place.” Everyone began to discuss amongst themselves.

The last was Xiong Tiannan. Sitting on the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron, he closed his eyes and was pulled into primal chaos. He was nervous, but recalled what Lin Yun told him.

“Believe Lin Yun!” Xiong Tiannan calmed himself down and noticed that the vortex of primal chaos turned into a mirror. The mirror was blurred, but it became focused when he got close. This was Xiong Tiannan’s past experiences, and he couldn’t help smiling at how foolish he looked.

He might have a straightforward personality, but he had a pure heart. With just a slight force, the mirror shattered, and he captured the various phenomena reflected in the fragments of the mirror. Since Xiong Tiannan had a pure heart, it was easier for him to see through the primal chaos, and he only needed some comprehension to capture the phenomena.

As swiftly he progressed, Xiong Tiannan shattered nine mirrors. When the tenth mirror appeared, he couldn’t comprehend it and could only retreat from this space. When he opened his eyes, seventy-two paintings appeared behind him, breaking everyone’s record.

This shocked everyone, including Ao Jue, Lin Jiangxian, and Ji Zixi. They were curious because Xiong Tiannan’s anxiety earlier didn’t seem fake.

Xiong Tiannan was excited as he turned around and saw Lin Yun. They both smiled and Xiong Tiannan wore a smug look on his face. When he left the cauldron, he not only managed to comprehend seventy-two paintings, but he also obtained four Divine Dragon Destiny Pellets, leaving Zhao Zhanli dumbfounded.

He wasn’t surprised by Lin Jiangxian’s performance, but he couldn’t help feeling terrible that he lost to Xiong Tiannan.

“That works?” Zhao Zhanli cursed. He wasn’t too happy about this.

“The higher you climb, the harder you fall.” Shangguan Jue opened his eyes with a smile and wasn’t surprised about Xiong Tiannan’s achievement. Standing up, he looked so confident that it was as if he had already won, giving confidence to those from the Shadow Divine Palace.

But the silence didn’t last long. A commotion soon occurred because Lin Yun finally moved, walking over to the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron. Everyone knew about his bet with Shangguan Jue, so he instantly became the center of attention.

“Wanting to ascend the cauldron before three days. It looks like Lin Yun is prepared.”

“Even Xiong Tiannan could comprehend seventy-two paintings, and it looks like Lin Yun won’t be inferior.”

“He won’t win, right?” Those who wanted to see Shangguan Jue defeat Lin Yun became nervous.

“Brother Lin, it looks like you’re prepared.” Shangguan Jue came over with those from the Shadow Divine Palace.

“Yeah,” Lin Yun nodded.

“What do you think of bringing forth to bet? I said three days because I didn’t want to take advantage of you since I don’t need any preparations,” Shangguan Jue smiled. His words made everyone’s faces change, and they became excited because they knew that Shangguan Jue wasn’t someone who would boast.

Lin Yun smiled, “Brother Shangguan, it looks like you’re pretty confident.”

Shangguan Jue smiled, “Well, we can increase the bet if Brother Lin is interested.”

He seemed confident, with a smile on his face. He continued, “If you lose, you have to hand over two Golden Dao Fruits. If I lose, I will give you twenty Flame Origin Pellets. Aside from that, we will bet our harvest from the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron on the line!”

Everyone took a deep breath because the price would be great if they lost. Even Zhao Zhanli could obtain a Divine Dragon Destiny Pellet, so Lin Yun and Shangguan Jue would only obtain more.

Lin Yun was briefly stunned since he was surprised by that. He smiled, “You’re really bold.”

Shangguan Jue stepped forward and smiled, “Don’t tell me that you’re afraid?”

Zhao Zhanli coldly said, “What’s the matter? Don’t you want to reforge the glory of the Kunlun Realm? We’re giving you a chance now, and you don’t want it? Or are you afraid that my senior brother will trample on you before the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron? After all, it was forged by the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity.”

Lin Yun looked at Ji Zixi, who nodded. He smiled, “Since Brother Shangguan wants to play, I can’t possibly disappoint you.”

Lin Yun was calm because he didn’t know how he could lose. Back in the Hidden Sword Pavilion, if he was right, the white-clothed figure should have been the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity. Thinking that the Iris Sword Saint was related to the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity, Lin Yun couldn’t figure out how he could lose. Maybe the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity might let him cheat to win.

“You won’t regret it, right?” Shangguan Jue wore a playful smile.

When Lin Yun heard what Shangguan Jue said, he couldn’t help laughing and said nothing. If Shangguan Jue knew what he was thinking, he probably wouldn’t keep smiling.
