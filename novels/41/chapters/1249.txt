Chapter 1250 - You Should Rejoice

Before they arrived, they had heard that there was a monstrous genius in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect who completed the three challenges in the Azurerock Hidden Sword Pavilion and even became the champion.

But their gazes soon became uncertain because this person before them was too young. He seemed to only be in the Galaxy Stage, since they couldn’t sense the aura of a constellation coming from Lin Yun.

“Junior Brother Lin!” Jiang Lichen let out a breath of relief when he saw Lin Yun, since he was on the verge of not being able to hold himself back. If it wasn’t for Lin Yun, he would probably be humiliated.

Lin Yun nodded his head and glanced at Zhang Ting, “Although you guys are from the main sect, don’t forget that you guys are merely guests here. So remember your identity and don’t think that you guys are the owners here. If you guys take it too far, then don’t blame the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect for being unreasonable.”

His words instantly made the faces of Sword Sect’s disciples ugly. Compared to Jiang Lichen, Lin Yun’s words were even uglier.

“A mere disciple of a branch sect dares to be so arrogant? Are you rebelling against the main sect?” Zhang Ting said with his face darkening after he was sent flying back. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Seeing that the disciples of the Scarlet Firmament Peak were being so overbearing, Lin Yun now knew why Jian Jingtian didn’t like them. He looked at Zhang Ting and said, “I have no intentions of rebelling, but you’re in no position to teach the chief disciple of my Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect a lesson. As for the Sword Saint Mountain? Go on if you guys want to see it. If you want to climb it, then look for the sect master yourself. Now, you guys can get lost.”

“Who did you say to get lost?!”

“Repeat what you said!”

“Who are you to care who we’re teaching a lesson to?” Not only Zhang Ting, but even the other disciples also had rage flashing across their pupils. It was so much so that even Qin Tian’s face had become colder. After all, they felt that they were already polite to the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect as disciples of the Sword Sect.

If the elders of the Scarlet Firmament Peak didn’t warn them before they came here, they would’ve already flared up by now.

“Junior Brother, let’s forget about it. They’re from the main sect, and I’m fine. Let’s wait for the sect master with regards to the Sword Saint Mountain…” Jiang Lichen muttered because he didn’t want to blow the matter up.

“Who the hell do you think you are to talk to?” Zhang Ting coldly glared at Jiang Lichen. “If he doesn’t make it clear today, there’s no way we’ll let this matter rest. A mere disciple of a branch sect dares to be so impudent before us?”

“Am I not clear enough?” Lin Yun smirked with mockery flashing across his pupils. “Then I’ll make myself clear again. I said you, you, you, and you, get lost from here and don’t show yourselves before me. I don’t have a good temper!”

He didn’t have a good temper and was only concerned with those close to him. When he didn’t like someone, Lin Yun would never have the habit of keeping them around. Although Jiang Lichen was weak, he was still the face of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. Since he had witnessed this scene, he naturally had to stand out.

Qin Tian was included in the group that Lin Yun pointed out. He wasn’t just targeting Zhang Ting alone, but all the disciples of the Sword Sect. Lin Yun then winked and smiled. “Didn’t you guys listen correctly? I’m not targeting you, but everyone else here. Even if our senior brother is weak, you guys are in no position to teach him a lesson. Understood?”

Jiang Lichen was briefly stunned before he smiled. Lin Yun was as arrogant as before, but he was still ultimately someone on his side.

“Even we haven’t climbed the Sword Saint Mountain. So, who the hell do you guys think you are?”

“Well said, Junior Brother Lin!”

“Even if our senior brother is weak, he’s still not someone you guys can humiliate. Get lost!”

“That’s right. He’s still our senior brother, no matter what!” Lin Yun’s words instantly attracted the attention of others. They were long unhappy with the disciples of the Sword Sect, so they immediately gathered behind Lin Yun the moment he spoke out.

Jiang Lichen’s lips twitched and finally knew what was wrong. He had no idea if Lin Yun was helping him or humiliating him even further. When Lin Yun heard the echoes from the fellow disciples of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, Jiang Lichen smiled, “My bad, my bad.”

Jiang Lichen glared at him when he heard that. But Lin Yun didn’t end it there and looked at Zhang Ting’s party, “Anyhow, our senior brother isn’t someone the likes of you can touch.”

“Your senior brother is nothing and I even dare to touch you! I’ll see who dares to talk!” Zhang Ting charged toward Lin Yun before Qin Tian spoke up.

But Lin Yun maintained the smile on his face and took a step forth, unleashing his sword aura that came crashing down like a colossal mountain. Furthermore, his sword aura also soared into the sky.

The immense pressure immediately dropped Zhang Ting from mid-air. The sword aura that was crashing down on Zhang Ting made his face change. He wanted to circulate his sword intent, but he was deeply shocked when he realized that his sword intent was being restricted by Lin Yun’s sword aura.

“Sky sword intent!” Zhang Ting’s eyes flashed with disbelief. After all, sky sword intent was rarely seen from the Empyrean Realm even in the Ancient Barren Domain. Even in the Sword Sect, those who could grasp the sky sword intent in the Empyrean Realm were monstrous geniuses. But Zhang Ting was in even greater disbelief at the fact that Lin Yun’s sky sword intent was a little too strong.

Just when he was feeling uneasy, Lin Yun’s sword aura grew even more terrifying and he fell to the ground, landing on one knee. Lin Yun’s sword intent also made all the disciples of the Sword Sect’s faces change. When they looked at Lin Yun, their gazes became grave.

They already knew that Lin Yun was a monstrous genius, but they never imagined that Lin Yun would be so terrifying when he was only at the Galaxy Stage. This filled Zhang Ting’s eyes with shock as he circulated all his astral energy. But he still couldn’t judge the sword aura that Lin Yun was giving off. It was so much so that even he began to feel like he was suffocating and his face was turning pale.

“How is he so strong? He’s only a disciple of a branch sect. Even if he’s a genius, how can he possibly compete with us?” Zhang Ting was deeply shocked. He was no genius in the Scarlet Firmament Peak, but he wasn’t a pushover either. Even the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s chief disciple was just a joke in his eyes, but Lin Yun was a little too unreasonably strong.

“Stop!” Seeing that Zhang Ting couldn’t stand up no matter how he tried, two disciples who had a close relationship with Zhang Ting charged forth. In the blink of an eye, the two had already come before Lin Yun with their palms aimed at his left and right shoulders.

Their palms weren’t aimed at Lin Yun’s fatal spots because even an Astral Stage expert would be heavily injured after taking their attacks head-on. But when their palms landed on Lin Yun, they produced a metallic collision sound.

Not only did they fail to budge Lin Yun, but they could even feel their arms going numb and this brought shock to their eyes. Their hearts instantly sank and they wanted to retreat, but Lin Yun grabbed onto their wrists the moment they wanted to retreat. The two hands were like dragon claws tightly gripping onto their wrists with a powerful strength that quickly shattered the astral energy on the surface of their bodies.

“Go back!” Lin Yun raised the two disciples up and slammed them against one another. When the two disciples came in contact with each other, their bones began to crack. After he was done, Lin Yun casually threw the two disciples away like ragdolls.

When the two disciples fell to the ground, they bounced off the ground and flew a few hundred meters away. At this moment, Zhang Ting, who was down on one knee, finally couldn’t bear the pressure anymore and his other knee also fell onto the ground.

Looking at Zhang Ting, Lin Yun asked, “Such a huge greeting? Sorry, but I can’t accept that.”

Waving his hand, an invisible force slammed against Zhang Ting’s chest and he was sent flying away, while throwing out a mouthful of blood. When he fell onto the ground, he left several terrifying cracks on the ground.

This scene made all the disciples of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect take in a cold breath. They didn’t expect Lin Yun to be so ruthless.

Clapping his hands, Lin Yun smiled, “You guys want to teach others a lesson with that strength? Aren’t you guys joking around?”

“Senior Brother Qin!” The faces of the Sword Sect’s disciples changed as they turned to look at Qin Tian.

Qin Tian didn’t have any change on his face and merely looked at Lin Yun, “They didn’t use their constellation nor did they draw their swords. Weren’t you a little too ruthless to them?”

Lin Yun snickered when he heard that because Qin Tian made it sound as if he had drawn his sword or used his constellation. With disdain flashing through his pupils, Lin Yun said, “If they drew their swords, they’d know the true meaning of being ruthless.”

After all, Jiang Lichen was injured to the point that he threw out blood and Zhang Ting still showed no signs of stopping back then.

Qin Tian smirked and was enveloped in arrogance as he continued, “Before coming, the sect master told us that we’re not allowed to trigger disciples of the branch sects because of their lowly origins. But it looks like there’s no need for that with such an arrogant person like you here. Looks like you have no idea of the difference between main and branch if you’re not taught a lesson.”

This made all the Sword Sect’s disciples rejoice and wonder if Qin Tian was finally going to make a move. Especially Zhang Ting, who yelled out, “Brat, Senior Brother Qin is already at nine hundred and a half a year ago on the Empyrean Ranking. That’s a height that someone like you can never achieve. You should rejoice that senior brother is willing to fight you!”
