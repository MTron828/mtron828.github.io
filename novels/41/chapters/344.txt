Chapter 345 - Half a Month of Seclusion

“So, Lin Yun, you have to be careful when you leave the sect next time. We might have struck a blow in the Primal Origin Sect’s plot this time, but they might still come after you in the future.” Luo Feng looked at Lin Yun with a grave expression. At the same time, his eyes were filled with anticipation, “After all, you’re our hope for the Dragon Gate Competition three years from now.”

Three years from now? If there was an opportunity, Lin Yun would like to give his best at the Dragon Gate Competition this year. There were only eight quotas and there was still a drastic difference between him and Xin Jue, not to mention the eight titles.

Two days later, the group smoothly returned to the Sword Firmament Pavilion. The entire sect already knew what happened in the banquet. So Guardian Plum personally came to receive the group along with the seven Sword-Bearing Elders.

Since they brought honor to the sect, the sect naturally had to reward them. The seven Sword-Bearing Elders gave Lin Yun 500 second grade spiritual jades and 10 second grade pellets. It was a luxurious reward, which made many people envious. However, no one was jealous. After all, they would also receive a similar reward if they brought honor to the sect.

Everyone also received a reward for their performance. Then again, none of their rewards was comparable to Lin Yun.

Luo Feng was so proud that Bai Ting, who also was in attendence, was filled with jealousy. Many people were saying that Luo Feng was probably the next Elders Hall’s Hall Master now. After all, there was a huge gap between Luo Feng and Bai Ting due to Lin Yun.

Even some of Bai Ting’s friends started to distance themselves from him. Bai Ting felt that it was all that damned sword slave’s fault. Back then, he should’ve killed Lin Yun back in the Nine Stars Contest.

Bai Ting looked at Lin Yun with hatred surging in his heart. So when he squeezed out a smile on his face, it looked twisted and ugly. However, Lin Yun paid no attention to Bai Ting because he knew that there was nothing the latter could do to him.

Bai Ting had to suck it up no matter how much he hated Lin Yun. Then again, Lin Yun also couldn’t touch Bai Ting for the time being. After all, it wouldn’t be easy trying to touch an elder with high seniority in the sect. But it didn’t matter because Bai Ting would definitely feel more terrible than Lin Yun.

When Lin Yun returned to the Locket Mountain, an unavoidable celebration was held. But Lin Yun didn’t see Li Wuyou anywhere at the party. Later on, he found out from Mo Cheng that Li Wuyou went out on a training trip, which made Lin Yun feel gratified because it meant that the kid was finally growing up.

If Li Wuyou was still as lazy as he was back then, it wouldn’t be probable for him to gain any footing in the Great Qin Empire, not to mention becoming the strongest swordsman.

In just a few days, the Locket Mountain was swarmed with visitors. They were elders from various halls and various clans in the Great Qin Empire. But Lin Yun did not want to be involved with them, so he asked Xin Yan to greet them before heading to the Extermination Mountain Range.

Half a month later, deep in the Extermination Mountain Range, stood a violent waterfall. The crashing waterfall was the only sound that could be heard in the otherwise silent location. Suddenly, the lake violently trembled and a violet wave spread out into the surroundings. A faint sword cry could be heard over the sounds coming from the waterfall.

Simultaneously, sword intent and origin energy swept throughout the lake and didn’t stop for a moment. A ray shot out from the surface of the water, creating a huge wave.

But that ray wasn’t a sword beam, it was a youth. The youth’s defined features were perfectly outlined by the sun. His clothes quickly dried up and his hair fluttered in the wind, making him look captivating.

The youth was naturally Lin Yun who came here to avoid the visitors. After departing from the Locket Mountain, Lin Yun came here to practice the Aquaselenic Sword and the Age Sutra. Because of the Dragonflame Fruit, his cultivation grew by two stages.

If someone else was in Lin Yun’s shoes, they would have rejoiced at the increase in their cultivation. However, Lin Yun still felt uneasy about his growth. It was because he knew that origin energy didn’t depend on quantity, but quality.

“I’ve finally refined my origin energy after half a month and used 3,000 second grade spiritual jades.” Lin Yun stood on the surging lake and walked towards the shore. His clothes were perfectly dry despite the splashing water. Compared to half a month ago, Lin Yun’s aura looked even more innate.

Even if he wasn’t troubled by the trifling affairs, he would have come here to refine his origin energy. The battle with the Violet Palace Realm elder made him feel great pressure. Through the battle, he noticed that his attacks weren’t effective against the black-clothed man’s origin energy. If he didn’t have a cosmic artifact, he would’ve been killed.

Then, Lin Yun thought about the eight titles. He heard that the eight titles could fight with experts in the Violet Palace Realm and that the crown prince could even kill one. But Lin Yun didn’t know that the eight titles were all in the quasi-Violet Palace Realm, so there wasn’t much difference in the quality of their origin energy.

When Lin Yun turned around, the surging waves calmed down. His eyes suddenly flashed and he threw out a punch. Along with three explosions, the torrential origin energy caused thirty-six geysers to soar into the sky. When his origin energy spread out, the ground beneath him started to tremble.

“Water!” Lin Yun waved his hand. The Iris Flower within his body opened up and the thirty-six geysers turned into ice before they landed on the ground. The ice looked like pearls that shined brightly under the sun.

“Break!” A cold light flashed in his eyes. When Lin Yun balled his fist together, the coldness in the ice pillars dissipated and the ice turned back to water.

“Not bad. I might have taken a small step into the initial seventh stage of the Profound Martial Realm, but the power of my origin energy is a few times stronger than before. It looks like the 3,000 second grade spiritual jades weren't in vain,” muttered Lin Yun to himself.

This was the effect that he wanted. At this moment, the uneasiness he felt about his cultivation rising too quickly had disappeared. However, he was using up too many resources and exhausted all the second grade spiritual jades he got from the seven Sword-Bearing Elders. God only knows how many people would be shocked if they learned about this crazy consumption.

Although there was no way for his cultivation to take another step forward, he could still unlock the potential in his martial techniques. He was still left with the Vanquishing Dragon and Tiger in the Dragon-Tiger Fist. He could also try combining the three seals together and bringing the Seven Profound Steps to complete mastery.

At the same time, he could also try to raise the Dracophant Battle Physique to the fourth stage. After all, he still had the secret technique for the Dracophant Battle Physique, the Dracophant War Armor. It was a defensive technique that could even defend against cosmic artifacts.

Also, he couldn’t forget about the three ultimate moves from the Aquaselenic Sword and his Xiantian sword intent. There was still a lot for him to increase. Although it seemed like a mess, Lin Yun had already planned everything. He would start with the following - fist technique, movement technique , body-refining technique, secret technique, sword techniques, and finally the xiantian sword intent. In this way, he would tackle the easiest and end with the most difficult.

So Lin Yun decided to spend the remainder of his time training in the Extermination Mountain Range.
