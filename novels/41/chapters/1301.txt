Chapter 1302 - Who The Hell Are You?!

When all the phenomenon came to an end, it felt as though a myriad of years had passed. Ye Xun and Fang Muyang’s killer attacks were instantly destroyed under Lin Yun’s attack and their saint armors were destroyed. Both of their faces were pale, covered in wounds. They had never felt so weak before.

When Lin Yun descended with the boundless sword aura, the immense pressure made Ye Xun and Fang Muyang fall to their knees. But Lin Yun didn’t end with that and brought out the Azure Dragon Grasp. “Come over!”

Xia Yunzhen, who lost an arm, released a scream before he was pulled over by the suction force. As Xia Yunzhen began to panic, he tried to place pressure on Lin Yun with his sect, “You’re insane! If you dare to make yourself an enemy of the three powerful sects, not even a god can save you! Let us go!”

But Lin Yun merely stepped on Xia Yunzhen and pointed his sword at Ye Xun and Fang Muyang, scaring the two of them to the point that they didn’t dare to utter a single word. The two of them were also preparing to threaten Lin Yun with their sects, but they were scared to the point that they could only shut up now. As fear loomed over their hearts, the sword gave them a feeling that they would be torn apart if they dared to make a move.

Looking at Ye Xun and Fang Muyang, Lin Yun said, “So what if you guys gang up on me? This is the only outcome for you guys!”

Ye Xun and Fang Muyang’s faces were ugly, especially Ye Xun. He had his own pride and was disdainful of joining forces to gang up on Lin Yun. They had looked down on Lin Yun deep within their hearts, but he never expected that not only was he forced to join hands with Fang Muyang, he was even forced to get down on his knees at this moment.

This scene left the audience members shocked because they had never expected this scene. After all, those three were transcendent geniuses, the strongest batch of geniuses on the Empyrean Ranking. They were like gods who couldn’t be defiled, but their current state was too much of a blow for them to accept. At this moment, they still couldn’t believe that this was real.

“Sorry about that, but you guys are a little late…” Lin Yun said after sweeping his gaze over.

On the other hand, the three Greater Elysium Core Realm experts who were late had rage blazing in their pupils. They were worried that if they made a move, Lin Yun would kill the three transcendents of their sects, so they didn’t dare to make a move.

“Is that fellow insane?!”

“Provoking the three Greater Elysium Core Realm experts, and showing no intention of leaving…” Everyone was surprised that the silver-clothed youth would be so arrogant when facing the three experts.

The Greater Elysium Core Realm experts of the Emerald Jade Manor, Heavenly Blade Pavilion, and Thunder Sect exchanged a glance. They could see each other’s shock in their eyes. A brief moment later, the Heavenly Blade Pavilion’s expert said, “Forget it. Leave the Dragon Saint Pellet and Quasi-Saint Origin behind, and we can let you go. Our Heavenly Blade Pavilion won’t make things difficult for you in the Profound Wither Island.”

The Emerald Jade Manor’s expert had reluctance in his eyes, but he still said, “Get lost, then. Leave behind the treasures from the underground palace and we can spare your life.”

“The Thunder Sect also guarantees that we’ll spare your life if you hand over the treasures.” Everyone was surprised that the three sects would take a step back and didn’t take Lin Yun’s life.

“Aren’t you guys getting something wrong?” Lin Yun said from under the mask. “I will hand the treasures over and you guys will spare my life? I’m wondering if I’m the one kneeling on the ground right now.”

Without any hesitation, Lin Yun swung his sword and left a wound on Ye Xun and Fang Muyang’s necks.

“No!”

Lin Yun’s sudden move terrified everyone because they never expected this scene. Even the three Greater Elysium Core Realm experts were shocked with their jaws dropping. When they recovered from their shock, they realized that those two were still alive; however, their faces were distorted with pain as they held onto their necks.

When they released their Greater Elysium Core Realm auras, the heavens and earth began to tremble, catching many people by surprise and fainting from the immense pressure. The three experts raged with their killing auras soaring to the sky. “You’re courting death!”

Greater Elysium Core Realm experts were practically standing at the top of the pyramid, and even transcendent geniuses wouldn’t dare to be careless when facing them. Right at that moment, a scream resounded. Lin Yun’s sword had pinned Xia Yunzhen to the ground. “Arghhh! Save me!”

That was Lin Yun’s response to the killing auras that the three Greater Elysium Core Realm geniuses released.

“What do you want?!” The scarlet-robbed elder from the Thunder Sect asked while gritting his teeth. Looking at Lin Yun, he practically had flames gushing from his pupils, but he had no choice but to bear it.

“Five hundred thousand Divine Astral Pellets,” said Lin Yun. He was never someone who would suffer a loss. Since these people had planned to gang up on him, then they naturally had to pay the price. Even if they regretted it at this moment, it was already too late.

The audience members were dumbfounded when they heard what Lin Yun said, and they wondered if they even heard him incorrectly. They couldn’t believe that Lin Yun was extorting them by using the three transcendent geniuses hostage. This made the scarlet-robbed elder’s lip twitch before he said, “Ahem, are you joking right now?”

“You think I’m joking with you right now?” Lin Yun said indifferently. “Or do you think that the lives of these three aren’t worth it? If you guys don’t have enough Divine Astral Pellets, you can pay me with saint elixirs. Don’t tell me that you guys don’t have any from the Profound Wither Island.”

After all, the powerful sects were practically invincible on the Profound Wither Island, and no one would dare to compete with them. It was so much so that most of the time, they would even snatch opportunities belonging to others. So even if they couldn’t afford five hundred thousand Divine Astral Pellets outside, they could naturally pay the price on the Profound Wither Island.

“No one has ever dared to extort a powerful sect. Even if we give it to you, do you think you can leave the Profound Wither Island alive?” The Emerald Jade Manor’s elder said in an eerie tone.

“I don’t need you guys to worry about that,” said Lin Yun.

Hearing that, the three Greater Elysium Core Realm experts’ faces changed. They really didn’t dare to make a move. After all, what Lin Yun did earlier covered them in a cold sweat, and they didn’t dare to provoke him right now, fearing that he would just flip the table.

“Release Yunzhen.” The scarlet-robbed elder said, throwing an interspatial pouch to Lin Yun with five hundred thousand Divine Astral Pellets in it.

When Lin Yun saw this, he realized that he had asked a little too low. These people probably had more harvests on the Profound Wither Island. But he didn’t have any change on his face and smiled. “Straightforward! Alright, you can get up now.”

Lin Yun pulled the Flower Burial Sword away from Xia Yunzhen and sent him flying over with a kick. This made the scarlet-robbed elder’s face change and quickly catch Xia Yunzhen before he turned to look at Lin Yun.

“Save me!”

“Elder, save me!”

Seeing that Xia Yunzhen was released, Fang Muyang and Ye Xun quickly yelled. This made the Emerald Jade Manor and Heavenly Blade Pavilion’s experts feel embarrassed, but they could only pay the extortion.

“Powerful sects are extraordinary indeed.” Lin Yun waved his hand and sent the remaining two transcendents flying over. He then let out a smile. He was satisfied with his harvest from the three sects. “Alright, time for me to leave.”

“Leave? You think you can leave?” The scarlet-robbed elder was enraged and a bright sun manifested with lightning and flame rising behind Lin Yun.

“Going back against your words? Oh, I forgot to tell you that I have two swords.” Lin Yun waved his hand and summoned the Lightning Shadow Sword from the sword box. Before others could comprehend what Lin Yun meant, the thousand-rune saint sword produced by the Mo Clan unleashed a dazzling light. The sword had a divine rune engraved on it, and it was shining brightly, making the heavens and earth tremble when it shone.

“A thousand-rune saint artifact?” The scarlet-robbed elder was surprised before he sneered in disdain. He didn’t believe that Lin Yun could unleash much of its power. But the moment he thought that, the sword had already slashed down, destroying the sun that he had manifested, causing the scarlet-robbed elder to fall to his knee and coughed out blood. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Lin Yun’s sword was unbelievably fast, and they now knew why Lin Yun had the courage to face Greater Elysium Core Realm experts. Right from the start, he was confident that he could turn the tables around with his ability.

“None of you can stop me from leaving,” said Lin Yun coldly, looking at the scarlet-robbed elder.

The scarlet-robbed elder didn’t dare to utter a word with his face distorted from pain. He knew that the Thunder Sect had been greatly embarrassed this time. The elders from the Emerald Jade Manor and Heavenly Blade Pavilion had their backs covered in sweat, while they inwardly rejoiced. They were rejoicing at the fact that they were slower; otherwise, they would have suffered the same outcome as the scarlet-robbed elder. At the same time, they realized that the thousand-rune saint artifact definitely had a terrifying origin.

“Who the hell are you?! Do you dare to leave your name behind?” Ye Xun said as he looked at Lin Yun.

Lin Yun had already soared into the sky, but he turned around and left his words behind, “I’m Flower Burial, burying both flowers and people alike.”

When Fang Muyang, Ye Xun, and Xia Yunzhen heard that, they were completely left dumbfounded and couldn’t believe that he had really come to the Profound Wither Island.
