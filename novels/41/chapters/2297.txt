Chapter 2298 - Divine Phoenix Mountain’s Secrets

Ye Guhan was calm, with no surprise on his face. He said, “I’ve already guessed it. The Divine Phoenix Mountain won’t dare to neglect you since you gave the divine flame fragment to that lass. They might give you some resources or treasures, but you must do your best. Don’t hold too much hope that a Great Saint will help.”

Shortly after, Ye Guhan told Lin Yun about the inheritance and origin of the Divine Phoenix Mountain. “The Divine Phoenix Mountain and Heavenly Dao Sect can be traced back to ancient times, just like how the other holy lands have inheritances from ancient times with over a hundred thousand years of legacy. But they’re inferior in comparison to the Divine Phoenix Mountain and Heavenly Dao Sect. Even when it was three thousand years ago, the four clans within the sect were complicated and recruited geniuses.

“But the Divine Phoenix Mountain was mysterious because they sealed themselves from the outside world. The core only consists of the Ji Clan’s disciples. They might be a holy land, but they’re more like a bloodline clan instead. They have a deep connection with the Divine Phoenix Mountain. Even in the Dark Era, the Divine Phoenix Mountain was unaffected by the chaos.”RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Lin Yun’s expression became grave when he heard that. Since the Divine Phoenix Mountain could be unaffected, this meant that they must have their confidence in doing so.

“Compared to the three holy lands, they don’t have any ambitions. So it’s hard to convince them,” Ye Guhan said. “You can try to convince the Divine Dao Pavilion. The Divine Dao Pavilion has some ambitions and isn’t willing to be devoured by the three holy lands.”

“You’re right, but I still want to try it,” Lin Yun said.

“Go on, then. You can bring that little princess to the Sword Sect if it doesn't work. At that time, the Divine Phoenix Mountain will move since she’s their treasure,” Ye Guhan smiled.

“I like this plan!” Lil’ Purple agreed from within the Iris Secret Realm.

Lin Yun merely smiled, understanding Ye Guhan’s personality. He was just casually talking about it.

“Let’s go to the main topic. How’s your progress with the Great Profound Sword Canon? Let me test you,” Ye Guhan smiled.

“Senior Brother, please go ahead.” Lin Yun smiled as he circulated the Great Profound Sword Canon, performing it before Ye Guhan. He had reached the fifth stage in the Great Profound Sword Canon and could manifest five swords now. With five swords, he instantly had thousands of variations in the Great Profound Sword Array.

Each sword could be derived into thousands of swords with a single thought. The power was unimaginable when performing the Myriad Swords Unite and even tore the sky apart.

After Lin Yun, Ye Guhan smiled, “As expected of my beloved.”

Lin Yun would feel a chill run down his spine whenever he heard that, so he said, “Senior Brother, can you stop with that?”

“Hahaha! I’m just talking about it. Come, I’ll use the Great Profound Sword Canon and Profound Sky Canon while you use the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon and Great Profound Sword Canon,” Ye Guhan smiled.

Lin Yun’s eyes lit up, and said, “Sure, but you can’t use Space Dao.”

“That depends on if you’re still my beloved,” Ye Guhan laughed.

The Divine Phoenix Mountain awaited Lin Yun’s return outside the God Burial Mountain Range. Lin Yun has been gone for a long time, but they had no unhappiness. When they saw various phenomena appearing, they couldn’t help soaring to the sky with shock on their faces.

Ji Zixi said, “It’s no wonder why the Azure River Sword Saint wants to meet Big Brother Lin. He’s trying to guide Big Brother Lin. It looks like the disciples of the Radiant’s lineage have a good relationship.”

Many people agreed when they heard that. At the very least, it’s rare for a senior brother to take such good care of a junior brother after leaving the sect.

The Last Sky Great Saint merely smiled, realizing that Ji Zixi was still young. Ye Guhan clearly had words to tell Lin Yun, which might be related to the Divine Phoenix Mountain, and it wasn’t convenient to talk about it before them. Compared to Ye Guhan and Lin Yun, he was more concerned about the Senior Lin Yun had gone to meet.

Four hours later, Lin Yun returned with exhaustion and a pale complexion. Ye Guhan used Space Dao at the end to teach Lin Yun a final lesson.

“Big Brother Lin!” Ji Zixi came forth and smiled, “The Astral River Sword Saint was guiding you in the sword earlier, right? You two have such a good relationship together.”

The corner of Lin Yun’s lips twitched, recalling what Ye Guhan said before he left. He said his love was all in his Space Dao for him to feel. Lin Yun had to admit that as one of the Nine Eternal Daos, Space Dao was too heaven-defying. Experiencing Space Dao also allowed him to become familiar with it. He squeezed out a smile, “Yeah.”

“Flower Burial Sword Saint.” The Last Sky Great Saint curiously spoke out when he saw Lin Yun was alone.

“Senior, you can just call me Lin Yun. Flower Burial will do, too,” Lin Yun replied. The Last Sky Great Saint was a Great Saint, and Lin Yun felt weird being addressed as Flower Burial Sword Saint by someone like that.

The Last Sky Great Saint smiled, “You’re a Saint Lord now, so you have to get used to it. Speaking of which, is that Senior gone?”

Lin Yun didn’t give a direct reply but smiled, “Last Sky Great Saint, you know that Senior?”

Hearing what he said, the two Saint Sovereigns looked hesitant to speak.

“Truthfully speaking, she was the one who taught me the Phoenix Heart Song,” Lin Yun said.

After hearing that, the two Saint Sovereigns’ faces changed with shock as they turned to look at the Last Sky Great Saint.

“I see…” Ji Zixi’s eyes lit up. She smiled, “Big Brother Lin, you have to play it for us in the Divine Phoenix Mountain this time. You might’ve given us the score, but it is somewhat lacking whenever we play it. Even my father has no idea what is going on.”

The Last Sky Great Saint helplessly smiled, understanding that this little princess had no reservations.

The Astral River Saint Sovereign added, “It’s pretty good when played by several Saint Lords proficient in music.”

“They’re much worse in comparison. Big Brother Lin’s Phoenix Heart Song allowed me to make a breakthrough in the Phoenix Saint Canon. Those uncles are worst in comparison,” Ji Zixi said. She was only seventeen or eighteen years old. She’s still innocent, speaking straightforwardly.

The Astral River Saint Sovereign awkwardly smiled as he looked at Lin Yun upon hearing that.

Lin Yun’s eyes flickered as he thought of something and merely responded with a smile. It looked like it was not only Ji Zixi who was passionate about having him visit the Divine Phoenix Mountain. Everyone in the Divine Phoenix Mountain must be curious as well.

The Last Sky Great Saint said, “Haha. That senior’s affairs aren’t a secret, either. You can find the answer yourself when we’re on the Divine Phoenix Mountain. Everyone, including the master, welcomes your visit.”

“I’m also looking forward to it,” Lin Yun smiled.

The Divine Phoenix Mountain summoned their carriages before flying away. Just beforehand, Ji Zixi invited Lin Yun to her carriage, which Lin Yun refused under the Last Sky Great Saint’s “amicable” gaze.

While everyone was heading to the Divine Phoenix Mountain, the news about the battle outside the God Burial Mountain Range spread throughout the Kunlun Realm, causing a great shock.

“Lin Yun has become a Sword Saint?” When the Profound Sky Sect’s Qin Cang learned about it, he bounced up from his seat and hurriedly met up with Tian Xuanzi, with Zhuge Qingyun in tow.

Tian Xuanzi was in seclusion and couldn’t be disrupted, but he did mention to find him if there’s anything involving Lin Yun.
