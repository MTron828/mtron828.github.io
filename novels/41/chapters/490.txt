Chapter 491 - A Terrifying Woman

How to deal with Lu Siyin? Lu Siyin stood between Lin Yun and Liu Yunyan and there was no way the two parties could work together if she wasn’t dealt with. Based on Lin Yun’s personality, he naturally preferred her dead. But to Liu Yunyan, it was already her bottomline for Lin Yun to kill Leng Feng. So if Lin Yun tried to kill Lu Siyin, Liu Yunyan would definitely flip out.

Even though they had committed a grave mistake, the academy should be the executor of their punishment. But if she wasn’t immediately dealt with, Lin Yun would definitely leave.

Lying on the ground, Lu Siyin could sense the abnormal atmosphere that made her feel uneasy, especially when Liu Yunyan’s gaze fell onto her. Liu Yunyan’s gaze made her tremble.

“I’ll deal with her,” said Liu Yunyan as she walked to Lu Siyin.

“Senior Sister, I’ve really realized my mistake. Please let me go this once…” Lu Siyin sobbed and her pitiful state drew the compassion of others. Even Bai Yi couldn't bear to watch this scene. Lu Siyin’s hair was scattered in a mess, her face swollen like a pig, and there were bloodstains on her nose and lips. She had lost her usual aloof appearance at this moment.

“Senior Sister…” Bai Yi spoke out, but the moment she did, Liu Yunyan turned back and glared at her, which made her shut her mouth.

“Lu Siyin, I’ll give you two choices. One, go back to the academy and report what you did. Two, get lost from my sight and never appear in the Nether Prefecture again,” said Liu Yunyan coldly.

“Please don’t do this. Senior Sister, let me off the hook. I’ll even kneel to you. Can’t you let me go? Is our relationship over the past two years worth a sword slave?” Lu Siyin begged as she kneeled on the ground. If she went back to the academy and reported that she stole someone’s treasures, it would be worse than being killed. Even if she wasn’t expelled from the academy, she would still be branded with shame for the rest of her life.

As for the second choice, it was the same as telling her to leave the academy. The academy was a quasi-overlord force in the Nether Prefecture with a deep foundation. It wasn’t a place that the Sword Firmament Pavilion could compare to.

She had already gotten used to the resources provided to her by the academy over the years, so becoming a wandering cultivator was worse than being killed in her eyes.

Watching this scene from afar, Lin Yun realized that he had underestimated Liu Yunyan. It wasn’t because Liu Yunyan was too gentle, but her decisiveness was her greatest leeway to him.

“It looks like you’re not going to choose. Since that’s the case, then I can only leave you to Lin Yun to deal with,” said Liu Yunyan.

“You’re ruthless!” Lu Siyin’s eyes revealed despair as she yelled, “Liu Yunyan, I hate you. I’ll remember the shame I suffered today and I’ll repay it tenfold in the future!”

Liu Yunyan cast a glance at Lu Siyin with a cold light flickering in her eyes as she released her killing aura.

“S-senior sister…” Two disciples stood by the side and tried to persuade Liu Yunyan.

“Repay it tenfold?” Liu Yunyan laughed as her voice became cold, “I’m letting you live and you still want to repay it tenfold to me? Do I look like a pushover to you? Cripple this bitch’s cultivation and throw her out. Now!”

“Y-yes!” The two disciples trembled as it had been a long time since they saw Liu Yunyan so furious. They no longer dared to hesitate and looked at Lu Siyin with pity. They cupped their hands together saying, “Sorry about this.”

Without any hesitation, they dragged Lu Siyin out of the camp.

“Senior sister, I’m sorry! I’m really sorry…” Lu Siyin’s sobbing made everyone in the camp feel a chill run down their spine. When Lin Yun came over, he looked at Liu Yunyan. He knew that he had underestimated her.

“Young Master Lin, I wonder if you’re satisfied with this?” she asked.

“I’m impressed by your methods,” replied Lin Yun.

“I let her live and she didn’t appreciate it. So I naturally won’t leave a future disaster around. I hope that you weren’t boasting with your words earlier. If you’re not able to hold back Nethercloud Ghost’s disciple, then our deal is off,” said Liu Yunyan as she looked at Lin Yun deeply.

She’s threatening me? Interesting! Lin Yun smiled as he rubbed his nose. Now that he looked at it, the most dangerous one wasn’t Leng Yi, but Liu Yunyan. If they obtained the Indigoflame Goldlotus and she refused to admit to the deal, then his outcome might be like Lu Siyin’s.

But if she thought that she could intimidate him with this much, then she was a little too naive. Lin Yun didn’t think about it too much and found a place to cultivate near the camp. Liu Yunyan, Bai Yi, and the other disciples were gathered together for a discussion. Occasionally, they would look at Lin Yun’s direction.

“Senior Sister, is that person reliable?”

“Yeah, Leng Yi is the disciple of the Nethercloud Ghost. Many of our disciples died in his hands,” whispered a disciple. He didn’t believe in Lin Yun’s words because they had suffered too much from Leng Yi.

“But Big Brother Lin is clearly the one who resolved our crisis. Otherwise, how would the Draconian Rockrats leave?” argued Bai Yi.

“Junior Sister, the reason why Leng Yi left is because he suffered the backlash of his array. He wasn’t entirely defeated by Lin Yun.”

“You have no idea how terrifying Leng Yi is without fighting him. He’s more troublesome than Pan Yue.”

“There’s no need to fight anymore. It’s not like I like him. Plus, I won’t let him off if he can’t hold back Leng Yi and causes me to lose the Indigoflame Goldlotus. Then again, I won’t be stingy if he’s able to hold his end of the deal,” said Liu Yunyan. She then looked at Bai Yi and said, “Junior Sister, you’ve interacted with him for so many days. Did he say anything about his origin?”

“I didn’t ask about it…” Bai Yi’s face blushed and she tapped her finger on her forehead before she continued, “Big Brother Lin seems to be from the Great Qin Empire.”

“The Great Qin Empire?” Liu Yunyan was briefly stunned when she heard that. Could he be ‘that’ person?

“Senior Sister, do you know about him?” asked Bai Yi.

“Don’t worry about this for now. Go back and remain vigilant. The Bloodwing Pavilion might launch another attack at us,” said Liu Yunyan calmly.

“Yes!”

“Lass, you stay behind. There’s some common sense stuff I have to teach you,” continued Liu Yunyan.

About fifteen minutes later, Lin Yun could sense someone approaching. When he opened his eyes, he saw Bai Yi walking over.

“Big Brother Lin, I’m sorry,” said Bai Yi with her head lowered.

“What’s the matter?” asked Lin Yun.

“Senior Sister told me that it’s inappropriate to keep asking for your help. But I’m not really doing it on purpose. I only feel that you’re a good person,” said Bai Yi as her face was blushing from shame.

So it turns out that she was reprimanded. Lin Yun smiled, “Yeah, look at how red your face is. How can Bai Yi be that kind of person? You’re being too sensitive.” It was a little awkward to call her silly, so he tried his best to be careful.

“That’s right. See, I knew Big Brother Lin would understand me,” smiled Bai Yi after she was ‘praised’ by Lin Yun.

Lin Yun smiled bitterly and said, “Turn around.”

“What’s the matter?” asked Bai Yi.

“Just do it,” requested Lin Yun.

“Oh.” Bai Yi turned around despite her curiosity.

After she turned around, Bai Yi realised that there was a soft silk armor in her hand. She asked, “What is this?”

“It’s a cosmic artifact, the Goldsilk Softarmor. The fight for the Indigoflame Goldlotus will be dangerous. I promised Liu Yunyan that I will hold back Leng Yi, so I’m afraid I won’t have time to protect you. Put this armor on. It can protect you at crucial times,” said Lin Yun. This armor might seem ordinary, but it was valuable since Lin Yun had been wearing it. Without this armor, he would’ve lost his life in the fight with the greater Yin stage wandering cultivator.

“It’s too valuable. I can’t take it,” replied Bai Yi as she shook her head like a tree in the wind.

Lin Yun smiled, “What’s the matter? You’re not going to listen to me anymore? I listened to you and helped out tonight. Furthermore, I have no further use for it with my current strength.”

“Is that the truth?” asked Bai Yi.

“Keep it well,” responded Lin Yun. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Bai Yi didn’t dare to go against Lin Yun’s words and received the armor. When she felt the warmth lingering on the armor, her face blushed.

“Let’s go. I’ll bring you to roast some meat.” Lin Yun decided to let Bai Yi have a taste of his culinary skill since she has been taking care of him the past few days.

“I can’t. S-senior Sister said to be alert at night. We’re not supposed to wander around or we’ll be punished,” said Bai yi as she peeked back at the camp. But judging from her expression, she was clearly tempted.

“Let’s go. Your Senior Sister won’t care about me.” Lin Yun didn’t care about anything else. He held onto Bai Yi’s hand and walked out.

Bai Yi’s heart began to jump wildly with guilt. Was it really appropriate to sneak out behind her senior sister’s back? But then again, she could feel a little excitement building up in the bottom of her heart. Then, after she ate the meat Lin Yun roasted, the guilt and excitement disappeared.

“Big Brother Lin, this is good…” Bai Yi munched on the food with her lips covered in oil. There was no elegance in her appearance, but the way she ate was adorable.

“You’re even more gluttonous than foolish,” teased Lin Yun.

“Who’s the fool?” asked Bai Yi.

“The fool is…” At that moment, Lin Yun started missing Lil’ Red. Although he knew that Lil’ Red must be fine, he still couldn’t help feeling a little sorrow from their separation. He then explained to Bai Yi about Lil’ Red.

“Oh! I-I saw it before!” Bai Yi placed the meat down and spoke in an emotional tone, “I really saw it before. There was a red horse at the shore back then and we were all curious about it. Senior Sister Lu even said that it was a rare Dragon Blooded Horse. She even wanted to capture it.”

“So? Did she capture it?” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly.

“She didn’t. She failed badly. After that incident, the red horse no longer appeared,” said Bai Yi in pity. Lin Yun could tell that she was rather fond of Lil’ Red.

It would be weird if Lu Siyin could capture him. Lin Yun smiled because he was relieved knowing that Lil’ Red was fine. Who knows when it would appear again.

“I’ll let you ride it when it comes back,” said Lin Yun.

“Deal! But Big Brother Lin, I don’t want to ride it. I just want to touch it. It looks cheap when it laughs. Plus, I want to touch its bucktooth,” said Bai Yi in excitement. Her words left Lin Yun speechless.

“You guys seem pretty happy. Am I welcome?” A voice sounded out, coming from Liu Yunyan.

“Senior Sister!” Bai Yi trembled and she quickly stood up. But she was placed in an awkward position as she held onto the roasted meat. She then quickly thought of an idea and suggested, “Senior Sister, this is delicious. Do you want some?”

“Go back to the camp. Now!” glared Liu Yunyan.

“Oh…” Bai Yi winked at Lin Yun before she left.

“Miss Liu, that’s some impressive movement technique there. Why don’t you have some since you’re here?” smiled Lin Yun.

Liu Yunyan merely glanced at Lin Yun before she turned around. “I heard that there’s a monstrous genius in the Sword Firmament Pavilion back in the Great Qin Empire. That genius rang the Phoenix Plum, created a legend in the Demonlotus Realm, and remained as the last one standing in the Dragon Gate Competition’s Hell Mode. His name is Flower Burial.”

The smile gradually faded from Lin Yun’s face and he looked at Liu Yunyan with a grave expression.
