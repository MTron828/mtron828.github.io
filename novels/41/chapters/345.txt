Chapter 346 - Training in the Forest

The depths of the Extermination Mountain Range was far from the Sword Firmament Pavilion. God knows how many demonic beasts were hidden in this forest and terrifying auras would burst out occasionally from the forest.

This made the mountain range feel like a volcano that would erupt at any time. But in the midst of the outburst of terrifying aura, sword intent soared into the sky, causing the nearby demonic beasts to tremble in fear. Many demonic beasts trembled in fear while the stronger ones tried their best to conceal themselves.

The territories of the demonic beasts were filled with spiritual energy, so they wouldn’t give up their territories easily. But under this terrifying aura, the demonic beasts were fearful and had no choice but to give up on their territories.

However, there were still some demonic beasts that were filled with hostility and approached the sword intent.

“Three seals, combine!” A voice suddenly echoed and several different auras tried to fuse. But just when they were about to combine, they suddenly collapsed. A groan sounded out and Lin Yun’s face turned pale.

“I failed?” Lin Yun had forgotten how many times he had failed over the past fifteen days. He would suffer a backlash from the Dragon-Tiger Fist’s origin energy every time this happened, which made his bones feel like they were breaking apart. Fortunately, Lin Yun had the Dracophant Battle Physique. If it was someone else from the Heavenly Profound Sect in his shoes, they wouldn’t dare to try this.

“I should be doing this properly, but I’m just lacking something for some reason. I have to suppress the three seals for them to merge,” analyzed Lin Yun as he took a pellet to regulate his energy. The three seals by themselves were domineering, so he had no idea what would happen if he really managed to combine them. However, he knew that he wouldn’t be able to succeed if he didn’t have the courage to face death.

Lin Yun suddenly furrowed his eyebrows when he heard a subtle voice. He raised his brow and a cold arc rose on his lips. Many demonic beasts had been coming to him for the past half a month, but it was a pity that they were too weak for him to even stretch his muscles.

The Extermination Mountain Range was too big, so he hadn’t encountered any powerful demonic beasts, despite being so deep into the forest. Lin Yun hoped that he wouldn’t be disappointed this time.

Just as he fell into deep thought, three demonic beasts landed in front of him. When their massive bodies landed on the ground, the surrounding trees began to tremble and their leaves fell down.

Lin Yun raised his head and looked at the three demonic beasts. One was an Indigoflame Wolf with purple flames blazing at the tip of its tail. The second one was a Blackscaled Leopard who was covered in scales that looked like armor. The last was a Snaketailed Lion. It was an enormous lion with a venomous snake for its tail. These three demonic beasts were all elite demonic beasts in the eighth stage. The demonic aura emitting from them was so dense that there was a red aura surrounding them.

Within the same realm, the strength between cultivators was different. The same logic applied for demonic beasts. Within the same realm, demonic beasts were separated into the categories of elite, overlord, and monarch. An elite demonic beast could easily kill ten ordinary demonic beasts in the same stage.

Of course, the overlord demonic beasts could swallow up the elite demonic beasts. As for monarch demonic beasts, they were equivalent to cultivators that were considered monstrous geniuses. Even Lin Yun had to run if he encountered one. He had once seen an eighth stage demonic beast. The experience was so terrifying that ordinary demonic beasts were frozen in front of that demonic beast.

Facing three eighth stage elite demonic beasts, Lin Yun’s face became more serious. There was no agreement between demonic beasts and cultivators. In the demonic beasts’ eyes, cultivators were only useful as food and nourishment.

The Indigoflame Wolf took the initiative to attack first and charged over like a bolt of purple lightning.

“What speed!” Lin Yun was shocked before he smiled. He suddenly disappeared and reappeared beneath a huge tree thirty meters away. He didn’t slack in practicing the Seven Profound Steps over the past half month.

Compared to combining the three seals, it was easier to get the Seven Profound Steps to complete mastery. This made his movement technique even faster, which allowed him to travel thirty meters in the blink of an eye. This made the Indigoflame Wolf, who was rather confident in itself, quite shocked that it missed its attack.

Although Lin Yun managed to dodge the Indigoflame Wolf’s attack, he failed to dodge the Blackscaled Leopard’s attack. The Blackscaled Leopard had ferocity glowing in its eyes and pounced at the place where it thought Lin Yun would land. At the same time, the Snaketailed Lion also swiped with its claws. This was an attack that could easily kill an unprepared eighth stage cultivator.

It was a dangerous fight, so Lin Yun started circulating his origin energy. When he balled his fist, a vague dragon image manifested around his fist. When he clenched his fist even tighter, the dragon image unleashed a roar and merged with Lin Yun’s fist. This was the Dragon-Tiger Fist, Soaring Dragon.

The explosive power coming from Lin Yun’s fist was horrifying as he dashed at the Blackscaled Leopard. When they clashed, the Blackscaled Leopard was sent flying away. When it landed on the ground, the scales on its body began to wriggle to negate the sword aura hidden within the punch.

With a dragon on his left fist and a tiger on his right fist, Lin Yun bumped his fists together. It was like two mountains colliding together to form a majestic mountain that enveloped him. It was the Hidden Dragon, Crouching Tiger. This was an attack that could be used to attack and defend.

When the Snaketailed Lion’s claw swung down, the ground trembled. But Lin Yun didn’t move, and he emerged from the cloud of dust unscathed. At this moment, the Indigoflame Wolf and the Blackscaled Leopard’s attacks were simultaneously headed for Lin Yun. In just a brief moment, the three elite demonic beasts had already unleashed more than a dozen attacks.

Just when the three demonic beasts were about to unleash another wave of attacks, Lin Yun’s aura erupted. His attitude instantly changed and an enormous tiger image appeared behind him with its eyes closed.

When Lin Yun threw his punch forward, the tiger suddenly opened its eyes and unleashed its aura as a king. The aura was intimidating, but Lin Yun had fused his sword intent, origin energy, and physical strength into his punch. If the tiger’s aura was like a king, then Lin Yun’s punch was like the descent of a king because of the Hundred Beast Wave.

The terrifying attack crushed the three demonic beast's attacks. First, he used Hidden Dragon, Crouching Tiger to gather his energy before he unleashed the Hundred Beast Wave. Among the three demonic beasts, the one with the weakest defence, the Indigoflame Wolf, blew up and turned into a cloud of blood.

As for the Snaketailed Lion, a horrifying crater was left on its body. In addition to the crater, it was also covered with wounds all around its body. Lastly, the Blackscaled Leopard was oozing blood as a large patch of its scales had fallen off.

Lin Yun looked around to determine the current situation before he charged at the Snaketailed Lion, who was more injured than the Blackscaled Leopard. His fists rained down on it like a violent blaze of flames, and after about a dozen punches, the colossal lion was a tiny shell of its former self. It was left in a terrible state.

Just when the Snaketailed Lion was about to fall, the venomous snake tried to bite Lin Yun. If Lin Yun was bitten by this snake, he would be heavily incapitated. But Lin Yun didn’t even take a look at the snake and stabbed his fingers through it like a sword.

In the next second, the venomous snake was reduced into seven pieces. Meanwhile, he threw the final punch at the lion’s head, causing it to collapse. When the lion collapsed, it raised a cloud of dust and the surrounding trees shook from the tremor of the quaking ground. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

When Lin Yun turned around, he saw the Blackscaled Leopard quietly get back up on its feet and run away. Lin Yun wasn’t in a hurry to chase after it. He retrieved the two beast cores and spread his arms apart to execute the Seven Profound Steps.

Like a golden crow spreading its wings, Lin Yun already traveled three hundred meters. When he descended to the ground, he jumped up and soared once more. It didn’t take long for him to catch up to the Blackscaled Leopard.

But when he looked at the surroundings, he noticed that he was in a barren land. He was surrounded by scorching rocks that released a terrifying temperature. When Lin Yun landed on the ground and started walking, he saw a towering peak in the distance.

There were densely packed thunderclouds above him, mixed with some crimson flickers. The Blackscaled Leopard turned around to look at Lin Yun with a sly look in its eyes. Then, it jumped around on the rocks with great agility before disappearing.

Lin Yun was surprised by the leopard’s sudden disappearance, but couldn’t react to it because a faint light descended from the sky that expelled all the shadows. At the same time, a ferocious tiger covered in blood appeared in front of Lin Yun.

An overlord demonic beast? The Blackscaled Leopard really knew how to find trouble for Lin Yun. The Blackscaled Leopard hadn’t really disappeared and was just hiding behind the enormous tiger. The tiger raised its head and looked at Lin Yun. Then, it opened its jaw to release the prey that was in its mouth. It looked at Lin Yun with a sinister smile.
