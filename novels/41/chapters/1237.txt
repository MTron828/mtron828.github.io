Chapter 1238 - Iris Secret Realm

When the blood fused with the sword box, Lin Yun felt a connection with the sword box that sent information into his mind. He could sense an extremely ancient seal, so he closed his eyes. When he was done, he opened his eyes and began to form seals with both of his hands, allowing the astral energy to surge.

When Lin Yun formed the seals with his hands, a metallic iris flower bloomed behind him. When the flower was done blooming, the ancient seal was successfully formed. This seal was called the Sky Unlocking Seal. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The sky opened the world within the sword box, and forcefully sucked Lin Yun inside. When his vision returned, he had disappeared from his residence and appeared in another world.

The world within the sword box was dark. Lin Yun couldn’t see any light, and the surroundings were desolate. At this moment, Lin Yun was standing on scorched black ground under an ancient tree.

“Where is this?” Lin Yun had doubt flashing through his pupils as he looked at this world with disbelief. It was entirely different from what he had imagined. He thought this world would be filled with treasures, a majestic divine mountain, or at least a pagoda.

“This is the world within the sword box,” said Lil’ Purple.

“Is that so?” Lin Yun lowered his head and looked at the countless withered tree branches on the ground and asked, “What’s this?”

“This was my den,” said Lil’ Purple.

When Lin Yun heard that, he couldn’t help laughing.

“What are you laughing at?” Lil’ Purple raged.

“If you didn’t tell me, I would have thought that this was a bird’s den. Wait, even a bird’s den is a lot stronger than this.” Lin Yun gently rubbed his foot on the ground, easily crushing the withered branches on the ground.

“Y-Y-You! That’s too much! I’m angry!” Lil’ Purple glared at Lin Yun.

This made Lin Yun’s face become awkward because he had only gently touched it, and he didn’t think that it would collapse. After all, he really couldn’t believe that this was the phoenix den.

“You baddie! You destroyed my phoenix den from 100,000 years ago!” Lil’ Purple began to cry.

This made Lin Yun panic as he quickly said, “Sorry about that. I’m in the wrong. How about this, I’ll give you a hug?”

As Lin Yun said, he went up and gave Lil’ Purple a hug.

“Go away! I don’t need your hug!” Lil’ Purple began to struggle, but Lin Yun smiled and gave her a hug.

“What’s that tree?” Lin Yun asked, looking at the withered tree. His gut was telling him that this tree wasn’t that simple, and it had only withered because there wasn’t any spiritual energy.

“Didn’t I already say that you destroyed my phoenix den? This tree is naturally one of the five divine trees, the Phoenix Tree. This tree was over 100,00 feet tall, and it had all sorts of fruits, flowers, and divine beasts on it.”

Lin Yun began to doubt when he heard that. After all, a tree that tall could basically be its own world. Then again, it could be the truth because it was rumored that phoenixes only rested on the Phoenix Tree.

“Look over there…” Lil’ Purple stretched her hand over and all Lin Yun saw was tens of thousands of charred wood.

“That place over there used to be a Divine Bamboo Forest, the material that was used to create your flute. They could be found anywhere back then,” said Lil’ Purple while she waved her hand around, causing Lin Yun to hug her even tighter in fear that she might fall.

“Over there were all sorts of saint herbs. There were even three divine herbs. Over here… there…” Lil’ Purple introduced Lin Yun to the places and there was even a mountain at the end of it.

“This used to be a celestial lake, and there was a divine spring up on the mountain where I used to bathe. I also had a myriad year cold jade bed there. Over there was a myriad lightning lake that could be used to temper the body!”

The more Lin Yun heard about it, the more shocked he became. He couldn’t imagine what kind of place this was in the past.

“If this place was even a hundredth of what you described it as, it could be called a holy land,” sighed Lin Yun.

“Hmph, this place was a holy land, an immortal holy land!” Lil’ Purple said.

Suddenly, Lin Yun sensed his sword intent hum as he approached a patch of charred dirt. There were many stained ancient swords on the ground that were so old they would turn to dust from a gentle breeze.

“What’s this place?” Lin Yun asked.

“This is a sword mound. The owners of those swords don’t want their swords to be used by others after their death, so the Iris Sword Saint collected them and buried them here. Back then, the owners of these swords were at least on the level of a saint…” Lil’ Purple’s tone slowly became soft as if she didn’t want to talk about it anymore.

Lin Yun’s face changed as he carefully retreated with an apologetic heart. As he walked, he saw many tattered buildings being buried in a desert along with a half-submerged tattered throne.

“This throne belonged to the Iris Sword Saint, and it contained seven different martial intents. Combined with his sword intent, it could unleash seven divine lights,” said Lil’ Purple while she looked at the throne with a complicated gaze.

As Lin Yun continued forward, he found a huge gulf blocking his way.

“If I remember correctly, it’s like purgatory down there. There are tens of thousands of flame veins that can give birth to sacred flames. I hate that place the most,” said Lil’ Purple with her brows locked together.

Standing on the cliff, Lin Yun looked around and sighed, “Why did this place become like this?”

“Perhaps something happened in the battle a hundred thousand years ago,” said Lil’ Purple.

But Lin Yun could tell that she was hiding something and asked, “You haven’t told me anything about yourself. What are you hiding?”

“Hmph, that’s my greatest secret. How can I possibly tell you that? Unless…” Lil’ Purple hooked her arms around Lin Yun’s neck and continued, “Unless you’re willing to be my servant. If that’s the case, then I can give it some thought.”

“You really know how to dream.” Lin Yun smiled.

There are too many secrets in this secret domain, but no matter how glorious this place used to be, it was only a barren world now. The best he could do was to walk around and listen to Lil’ Purple boast about this place. At the same time, he was finally sure that this place wouldn’t be of any help to him.

Retracting his gaze, Lin Yun placed Lil’ Purple down. However, she didn’t let go of his neck and even pouted, “No! I want you to carry me longer!”

Hearing that made Lin Yun’s lips twitch. It seems that the empress really considered herself to be a child.

“Y-Y-You’re not allowed to put me down! You destroyed my phoenix den, so you have to make it up to me!” Lil’ Purple argued with her face blushing.

“Didn’t someone say that she didn’t want me to carry her?” Lin Yun smiled.

“Hmph, you’re this empress’ servant. So you naturally have to serve me!” Lil’ Purple said.

Feeling helpless, Lin Yun could only continue to carry her. Luckily, she wasn’t heavy. “Is there any way to restore this place?”

“Of course there is. As long as you can collect all of the Sovereign Divine Runes, this place will come back to life,” said Lil’ Purple.

“Sovereign Divine Runes?”

“That’s right. The Extreme Wind Divine Rune, Sinful Fire Divine Rune, Myriad Lightning Divine Rune, Freezing Chill Divine Rune, Solar Lunar Divine Rune, Samsara Divine Rune, and Nirvana Divine Rune. A total of seven Sovereign Divine Runes. As long as you can gather all of them, you can restore this place back to how it looked back then,” said Lil’ Purple.

“Is there anything in it for me?” Lin Yun asked. He couldn’t even grasp a divine rune, so how was he going to search for Sovereign Divine Runes? If there weren’t any benefits, it would simply be a waste of his time.

“Hmph, you really are a pig head! Think about carrying an immortal holy land with you. Who could compete with you in terms of cultivation speed? Even monstrous geniuses would be nothing in your eyes. Why do you think that Iris Sword Saint could slay deities when he was only a saint back then?” Lil’ Purple said with disdain on her face.

“That doesn’t really seem too impressive.” Lin Yun smiled. It sounded good, but it was practically impossible to restore this place to how it once was. He didn’t even know where the Sovereign Divine Runes were, so how could he collect them?

Lil’ purple naturally saw Lin Yun’s hesitation and said, “What if I told you that the Sword Saint Mountain contained a Sovereign Divine Rune?”

“That…” Lin Yun was shocked when he heard that. At the same time, he now knew why Lil’ Purple wasn’t willing to tell him the secret of the Sword Saint Mountain. So it turned out that she was waiting for him to come here.

Lil’ Purple’s face was full of pride as she said, “You probably never thought about the sword that should be in the sword box, right?”

Lin Yun’s heart jolted and he squinted his eyes. After all, a sword box was meant to contain swords, so just what kind of sword could be kept in this sword box?
