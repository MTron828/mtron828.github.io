Chapter 1286 - Ancient Spiritual Lake

Leaving those transcendent geniuses aside, even the elite disciples of the big sects had a huge harvest. The Profound Wither Island was spacious, and there would be an occasional light soaring into the sky. Those were people who broke through the boundaries of the Empyrean Realm and were reaching the Elysium Core Realm. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Over the past ten-odd days, there were at least tens of thousands of people who have reached the Elysium Core Realm. They were all extraordinary geniuses, and this meant that they naturally became a lot stronger after reaching the Elysium Core Realm. This instantly placed Lin Yun in an awkward position, since he was only at the Galaxy Stage.

After ten-odd days passed in the blink of an eye, Lin Yun still didn’t manage to obtain any harvest. He was covered in dust, looking like a beggar, and his luck had never been so bad before. Nearly one month has passed, and he still hasn't manage to manifest his constellation. If this carried on, then he would practically be doomed.

On this day, Lin Yun stopped with his face changing. Taking a deep breath, he could see dense spiritual energy gushing out from far away. “What dense spiritual energy!”

Without any hesitation, he executed the Golden Crow Nine Transformation and charged forth. He soon found himself on a cliff with a waterfall. Beneath the waterfall was a lake covered in astral light. Looking at this lake, Lin Yun immediately had a joy on his face, feeling that his luck had turned around. “An ancient spiritual lake!”

“Get lost!”

“This place has already been occupied by our Flame Dragon Sect.”

“Our Senior Brother is in seclusion here, so get lost!”

“Oh my god. Where did this country bumpkin come from? He’s only at the Galaxy Stage?” Ten-odd figures flew out and they were at least at the Elysium Core Realm, guarding here, not letting anyone get close to the lake.

Seeing that Lin Yun was only at the Galaxy Stage, they began to laugh out loud. There were many opportunities in the Profound Wither Island, and thousand-year-old spiritual elixirs could be found everywhere, and quasi-saint elixirs weren’t rare, either. Those with some strength would be able to swiftly increase their strength.

But it was rare to see someone like Lin Yun, who was still at the Galaxy Stage, not to mention that Lin Yun was covered in dirt.

But Lin Yun was excited, and the joy was unconcealable on his face. He could sense that this lake wasn’t ordinary, and the cave in the waterfall seemed to contain an ancient ruin. When he looked at the spiritual lake, his gaze began to blaze with heat.

When those from the Flame Dragon Sect saw that Lin Yun wasn’t leaving, they couldn’t help laughing, “Hahaha! Look! He actually doesn’t want to leave!”

In their eyes, Lin Yun was no different from a beggar, someone who was only at the Galaxy Stage and dared to get close to the camp of their Flame Dragon Sect.

“Get lost. We don’t want to kill you.” The Flame Dragon Sect’s disciples all had pride on their faces when they snorted coldly. When they stepped forth, they released their aura as Elysium Core Realm experts, wanting to expel Lin Yun using their aura. After all, Lin Yun’s cultivation was too low and they didn’t even have the interest to kill him.

But something bizarre took place because Lin Yun had ignored them. He was still looking at the Ancient Spiritual Lake with the flames in his pupils growing even more wildly. He could tell that this Ancient Spiritual Lake wasn’t simple, and his firmament sword intent had sensed an ancient and extraordinary aura behind the waterfall.

This was why Lin Yun couldn’t contain his excitement. After all, he had been in the Profound Wither Island for so long, and he still had no harvest. As he looked at the Ancient Spiritual Lake, he began to grin while ignoring the elites from the Flame Dragon Sect.

“Is this fellow a retard? Has he never seen treasure before in his life?” The faces of the Flame Dragon Sect’s elites sank and one of them manifested a flame sword before attacking Lin Yun. But something surprising took place because when the flame sword landed on Lin Yun, it merely caused sparks to fly and he wasn’t able to injure Lin Yun at all.

This made the other elites briefly surprised before they immediately launch their attacks as well, all retrieving their saint artifacts. They were at the Elysium Core Realm, so they were able to unleash more power from the saint artifacts. In the next second, three flaming dragons were manifested as they charged at Lin Yun.

But Lin Yun’s eyes were still glued to the Ancient Spiritual Lake. He merely raised his hand and grabbed onto the three flaming dragons. When he clenched his fist together, the three flaming dragons exploded, unleashing a terrifying energy fluctuation. This also made the faces of those elites change.

They were overwhelmed with shock and disbelief when they looked at Lin Yun. At this moment, they realized that they couldn’t see through this azure-clothed figure who only seemed to be at the Galaxy Stage.

“You guys are from the Flame Dragon Sect?” Lin Yun recollected himself and squinted his eyes since he had instantly recognized the origin of these people. He had quite a grudge against the Flame Dragon Sect outside the Profound Wither Island, and there were many geniuses from the Flame Dragon Sect who ganged up on him outside.

“Who the hell are you? I’m Bai Luli!” A voice echoed from the waterfall that caused the heavens and earth to tremble.

He was the chief amongst the Empyrean Realm in the Flame Dragon Sect, ranked forty-seventh on the Empyrean Ranking. This made everyone wonder who was so bold to not only offend the Flame Dragon Sect, but also Bai Luli. The next second, countless people soared into the sky and looked in the direction the voice was coming from.

“I’m from the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, and I believe that you’re not unfamiliar with my name.” Lin Yun smiled as his mood became even better. He strongly believed that the misfortune had left him when he found Ancient Spiritual Lake.

His words made Bai Luli behind the waterfall fall into deep thoughts. But when he recalled something, he suddenly reached out and a beam of light shot out, forming into a boundless wind that blew out.

When all the dust blew away from Lin Yun, his true appearance was revealed before everyone. When Bai Luli saw Lin Yun, he instantly recognized him and flew into a rage, “It’s you!”

The elites of the Flame Dragon Sect were also briefly stunned before they recognized Lin Yun. After all, Lin Yun was someone who slew the eight geniuses from the eight big sects and forcibly seized the Dragon Blood Fruit from the big sects. So it would be weird if they weren’t furious after seeing Lin Yun, alone, before them.
