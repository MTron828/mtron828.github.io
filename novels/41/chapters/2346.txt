Chapter 2347 - Kunlun Realm’s Cultivators Aren’t Weaker Than Others!

The table was turned around, with Lin Yun gaining the advantage in the fight. Gu Jun was shocked because he had never seen or heard of this fist technique before. He exclaimed, “What fist technique is that?”

He could tell that the fist from before was a dragon clan’s martial technique, but not this one. That was something Lin Yun comprehended from ancient martial techniques and he had fused them into his sword, divine physique, and two sword canons. The profundity contained in it allowed him to easily suppress Gu Jun. Even the creator of the Dragon Sun and Moon Seal probably never expected that the martial technique he created would be so powerful.

“Holy shit, what’s going on?”

“Is he really from the Kunlun Realm? Isn’t that a barbaric realm?”

“The Kunlun Realm isn’t a barbaric realm, but the Heavenly Path is broken. It was famous throughout the universe back then.” Even if someone was blinded by the dazzling radiance earlier, many people continued to watch this battle. They were shocked as their gazes fell on Lin Yun.

“Holy shit, is that true?”

“Back then, even the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity received help from the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity. The Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity founded Kunlun Realm’s Divine Dragon Era.”

“It looks like Flower Burial is going to reforge the glory of the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity!” Many people directed their gazes over.

Gu Jun was suppressed and couldn’t come up with a solution anytime soon. But he was a ruthless person. He lunged forth with his aura released. The fight between Gu Jun and Lin Yun created a massive phenomenon that forced many people to retreat. As for this test, it was stopped for the time being.

Ten odd moves later, they both took ten steps back with another clash and Gu Jun drew his sword. This was a Sixspirit Glory Saint Artifact, only one step away from reaching Sevenspirit Glory Saint Artifact. It was a sword only second to a Sovereign Saint Artifact. When he swung his sword, the crimson clouds in the sky were suppressed.

Lin Yun waved and casually picked up a branch on the ground. But when Lin Yun pointed with it, a powerful sword aura spread out that infatuated Gu Jun. Anyone could tell that Lin Yun was looking down on him.

“How dare you!” Gu Jun soared to the sky. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Even grass can be used as a sword in the hands of a swordsman, and a branch is more than enough to give a deity blood like you a beating.” Lin Yun swung the branch and his sword aura surged again. His words made everyone’s blood boil.

“He’s really dashing...” Ao Jue admired with his eyes. After all, what arrogance was that to beat up a deity's blood with a tree branch?

Xiong Tiannan pouted when he saw this scene while Ji Zixi’s eyes shone brightly. Even Lin Jiangxian wore a smile.

“You’re courting death!” Gu Jun was enraged to the point that his face almost became distorted. When he unleashed his murderous intent and charged forth, a starry sky appeared once more, and each of his attacks was like a star falling from the sky.

Lin Yun was calm as his sword sea began to boil. Empowered with his Divine Light Sword Intent, he unleashed thousands of sword rays with a flick of his wrist.

“Withered Tree Coming To Life!”

“Intoxicating Nine Heavenly Wind!”

“Sky Streak Snow!”

“Four Peaceful Seas!”

By executing four sword techniques, various phenomena appeared from Lin Yun’s sword that tore apart all the sword aura in the sky. As for the tree branch, it still had leaves on it and wasn’t damaged one bit. Lin Yun smiled as he remained in the same spot, executing martial techniques with the tree branch.

Another ten moves later, Gu Jun lost his patience as a sun and a moon appeared in the sky and merged into his sword aura to form the Yin-Yang Sword Intent.

“This is...” Many people were shocked as they saw a waterfall crashing down from the sky as though it wanted to erase everything.

“He wants to forcibly suppress Lin Yun with his cultivation,” Ao Jue muttered.

In just ten-odd moves, Gu Jun already knew that his mastery of the sword was inferior to Lin Yun’s. He roared, “Let me show you the foundation of an Ancient Divine Clan!”

“Hahaha! Why would a swordsman fear a fight?!” Lin Yun laughed as he took three steps back before charging forth. With a spin, the branches were like overlapping sword flowers. This was the third section of the Divine Firefly Sword, Blooming Stars.

The sword unleashed an unprecedented power that roared like a massive dragon, sending the incoming stars flying away. As Lin Yun and Gu Jun clashed, the battleground became chaotic.

“You’re only a mortal blood!” Gu Jun roared as he fused the Great Solar, Great Yin, and Sword Daos. As Yin and Yang revolved, the surrounding space distorted, which placed tremendous pressure on Lin Yun.

“Glory to the Gu Clan!” Gu Jun wanted to maintain his advantage and give Lin Yun a beating. Aside from that, each of his Sovereign Daos had fifty to sixty saint daos around them, reaching over a hundred thousand saint daos.

This was the foundation of the Divine Clan. Everyone was shocked by Gu Jun’s foundation, with envy in their eyes. Gu Jun’s sword intent might not be comparable with Lin Yun’s, but he possessed the Great Solar and Great Yin Daos. When they were put together, it was no longer weaker than Divine Light Sword Intent at complete mastery.

“Kunlun Realm’s cultivators aren’t weaker than others!” Just when everyone felt Lin Yun would be in trouble, he summoned the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron to withstand the pressure before releasing a golden radiance, and a golden lotus appeared behind Lin Yun. The golden radiance made Lin Yun look like a dignified deity, and the tree branch in his hand was a divine artifact, shattering the domain that was formed by combining Great Yin, Great Solar, and Sword Daos.

“Break!” As Lin Yun rotated, the branch in his hand was like a whip that unleashed a massive sword ray, tearing the fusion of the three domains apart.

When Gu Jun fell from the sky, he threw out a mouthful of blood and fell onto one knee. He was covered in blood and had terrifying wounds.

When Lin Yun descended, he hovered in the sky, looking like a sword immortal.

“ARGHH!” Gu Jun screamed out in pain and wanted to charge forth, seeing Lin Yun descend. When they clashed, Lin Yun remained in the same position and blocked all of Gu Jun’s attacks, which left Gu Jun in shock.

Before Gu Jun could come to his senses, Lin Yun thrusted the tree branch towards Gu Jun’s forehead. This quickly made Gu Jun recollect his thoughts and swung his sword to block this attack. But with a gentle flick of his wrist, Lin Yun lashed the branch against Gu Jun’s face, producing a loud and resounding slap, leaving a wound on the latter’s face.

This scene frightened everyone because Lin Yun was too ruthless. The wound wasn’t serious, but it was humiliating.

Gu Jun nearly went insane as he threw out a mouthful of blood after taking two steps back. When he raised his head, he saw Lin Yun looking at him with a smile as though he was saying that he wasn’t even done with warming up yet.

This enraged Gu Jun into losing his rationale and he blindly charged at Lin Yun. He had flaws everywhere, and three moves later, the tree branch left another wound on Gu Jun’s face.

Before Gu Jun could respond, the tree branch wrapped around Gu Jun’s sword and pulled the sword over, which then stabbed into the ground.

Wielding the tree branch, Lin Yun coldly said, “I said that a tree branch is enough to deal with a deity’s blood like you.”

Gu Jun took a few steps back and held onto his face, looking at Lin Yun with an ugly expression.
