Chapter 1683 – Four Musical Houses

As the two ladies’ gazes fell on him, Lin Yun nodded. He could find an excuse the first time, but it would make Lin Wan suspicious if he refused again. After the Blood-Horned Aquatic Serpent fled, the other aquatic serpents also dispersed, and they could see the massive ship from afar.

It didn’t take long for the three to land on the ship. When they came, the other Heavenly Note Sect’s disciples quickly said, “Senior Sister, the aquatic serpents are gone…”

“We’re fine now. It’s all thanks to Young Master Lin Xiao that everyone is safe this time.” Lin Wan smiled.

“Isn’t this the same person as before?”

“Yeah, I remember that mask of his.”

“He’s formidable. I could tell he was extraordinary when he previously played the flute.”

“I bet he’s dashing under that mask.”

“Hehehe. I wonder how he looks under that mask!” The Heavenly Note Sect’s disciples were bold, and they were all staring at Lin Yun, blatantly discussing about him in front of him.

“Shoo, go away.” Lin Wan smiled, chasing the other disciples away. Since they were still young, they had no reservations about their discussions.

Hearing what Lin Wan said, the other Heavenly Note Sect’s disciples left as they chuckled. They would occasionally turn around to look at Lin Yun and chuckle. This made Lin Yun awkward because he had never experienced this before. It felt as though he had walked into a kingdom of women.

“Young Master Lin, you can go and rest first. We’ll make some preparations before coming to look for you.” Lin Wan gave Lin Yun a wink. The two were in a somewhat pathetic state with injuries on their bodies, so they couldn’t welcome Lin Yun in their current state.

“No worries.” Lin Yun smiled before he entered the cabin. Under the guidance of a Heavenly Note Sect’s disciple, he was brought to a relatively quiet room.

After Luo Shuyi and Lin Wan were done washing up, Lin Wan asked, “How are your injuries?”

“My injuries are pretty serious, but my foundation isn’t damaged. I’ll be fine after resting for some time.” Luo Shuyi smiled.

Nodding her head, Lin Wan replied, “I’ll go and welcome Lin Xiao later.”

“No.” Luo Shuyi shook her head decisively.

As surprise flashed through her pupils, Lin Wan naturally guessed what Luo Shuyi was thinking and smiled, “Don’t tell me that you still think he’s Lin Yun? Oh, silly you. Lin Yun is already dead. Even if he’s still alive, he won’t show himself within a century, so you can only consider him dead. Furthermore, do you think Lin Yun will have such attainment in music dao? Lin Xiao’s music dao is probably higher than ours. He probably has an ancient inheritance. If he’s really Lin Yun, do you think he has the guts to board our ship?”

Luo Shuyi sighed, “I know. But I don’t want to give up so easily.”

“Don’t overthink it. Let’s go.” Lin Wan held onto Luo Shuyi’s hand, comforting her with a smile.

An hour later, Lin Wan hosted a banquet to welcome Lin Yun, served with beautiful wine with Heavenly Note Sect’s disciples playing their instruments.

“Young Master Lin, let me give you a toast. I’m grateful to you for saving us.” Lin Wan and Luo Shuyi both raised their wine.

After the three shared a cup of wine, Lin Wan looked at Lin Yun with a smile, “Young Master Lin, your main objective must be the Nirvana Banquet, since you’re going to the Heavenly Domain City, right?”

When she saw Lin Yun nodding his head, Lin Wan’s eyes lit up, and she continued, “Out of the Flying Snow Pavilion, Seven Exquisite Palace, Myriad Flower Hall, and the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion, I wonder which musical house you’re invited to?”

“None of the above.” Lin Yun shook his head. If he wanted to join the Nirvana Banquet, aside from being invited by ancient holy lands, he could only enter one of the Four Musical Houses. The Nirvana Banquet was a competition between the Four Musical Houses.

The Heavenly Domain City had thousands of musical houses, but only four were comparable to holy lands. The four competed for first place, and the competition between them was intense. Their competition at the Nirvana Banquet would reach an unimaginable height. This was because the Nirvana Banquet was too famous.

If they managed to become first at the Nirvana Banquet, their name would soon spread throughout the Kunlun Realm, and the position of their musical house would also rise along with it. Thus, the Four Musical Houses wouldn’t only nurture musicians before the Nirvana Banquet, they would even invite all the famous musicians in the Kunlun Realm.

They long invited those from a clan with a long legacy, and the musical houses competed over them. So Lin Wan was surprised that such a young talented musician like Lin Xiao didn’t catch the attention of the Four Musical Houses.

“Young Master Lin, you should have an inheritance, right?” Lin Wan asked.

“I do have an inheritance, but my lineage has been in seclusion for many years. So it shouldn’t be known by anyone in the world.” Lin Yun said. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Lin Wan and Luo Shuyi exchanged glances, but they were both in disbelief.

“Out of the Four Musical Houses, I wonder which one you are interested in?” Luo Shuyi asked.

“None.” Lin Yun replied honestly. He planned to gather up with An Liuyan in the Heavenly Domain City before deciding. It was troublesome to enter the Four Musical Houses, to begin with. After all, he had concealed his identity and needed An Liuyan to prepare a fake identity.

“I wonder what Young Master Lin thinks of the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion? If you’re interested, I can make a recommendation for you.” Lin Wan smiled with her eyes squinted.

“I never expected Lady Lin to have such connections.” Lin Yun was surprised. After all, many musicians wanted to join the Nirvana Banquet. But the Four Musical Houses had a high threshold, and Lin Wan sounded confident in her tone.

“Not exactly.” Lin Wan smiled. “The Heavenly Note Sect has some reputation in the Ancient Barren Domain, not in the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea. But we have a good sister with a noble position in the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion. So it shouldn’t be a problem if she’s willing to help.”

“This doesn’t seem like a good idea…” Lin Yun hesitated.

But Lin Wan was straightforward, and she smiled, “You saved our lives, so we owe you one. Not to mention that you have a high attainment in music dao. So you’re worthy of that quota.”

Lin Yun still wanted to reject, but Luo Shuyi smiled, “Young Master Lin, don’t be in such a hurry to reject us. We’re not sure if that sister of ours will be willing to help out. So it won’t harm you if you agree for now. If you have other choices at that time, we’ll then discuss how we should return the favor of saving our lives.”

Luo Shuyi might sound gentle, but there was no loophole in her words, nor did she allow Lin Yun to reject the offer.

“Alright, then.” Lin Yun went along with it. He just had to join one of the Four Musical Houses, and it would save a lot of trouble if he could smoothly join the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion. So it wasn’t a bad thing for him to agree to it.

Seeing Lin Yun agree to it, Lin Wan smiled, “Young Master Lin, don’t mind me asking. Why are you wearing a mask?”

Her words lifted Luo Shuyi’s heart as her eyes were glued on Lin Yun.

“Oh? This?” Lin Yun smiled as he removed the mask on his face and handed it over. “This is a saint artifact. After all, I must be cautious traveling alone in the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea.”

He revealed a dashing face beneath his mask, but it was also unfamiliar. This changed Luo Shuyi’s face because she never expected Lin Yun would be so straightforward in removing his mask. But this also made her despair as she looked at the unfamiliar face, not to mention that Lin Xiao’s temperament was entirely different from Lin Yun's.

Lin Wan was also briefly stunned before she received the mask. But she was in no mood to examine the mask as she swept a glance at Luo Shuyi. When she looked at Luo Shuyi’s facial expression, she knew that the latter had given up. Thus, she merely examined the mask briefly before returning it to Lin Yun.

“Let me excuse myself.” Luo Shuyi’s facial expression was ugly as she bowed and left.

“What’s wrong with her?” Lin Yun looked at Luo Shuyi’s silhouette and felt a little uncertain.

Letting out a sigh, Lin Wan looked at Luo Shuyi’s silhouette, and she explained, “My junior sister felt that you looked like an acquaintance of hers. She hasn’t given up on him, so I asked you to remove your mask to make her give up.”

“I wonder who is this person that you speak of?” Lin Yun asked curiously while maintaining his composure.

“Flower Burial, Lin Yun.” Lin Wan sighed. As someone who witnessed that battle, even Lin Wan couldn’t maintain her composure when she mentioned Lin Yun’s name. Even after a month had passed, she still couldn’t forget that battle.

She couldn’t imagine that there would be a genius like Lin Yun. He first killed Qin Tian in the Ancient Barren Battlefield, then hedefeated a Samsara Edict Realm expert, killed a Saint Lord, and even killed a Great Saint. In the Ancient Barren Domain, there hadn’t been a breathtaking genius like Lin Yun in the past three thousand years.

Her explanation was what Lin Yun had expected. As his face changed, he had no idea how to reply.

“Young Master Lin, I wonder if you’ve heard of this person?” Lin Wan smiled, seeing Lin Yun’s expression. She exclaimed, smiling, “Oh, I forgot that you only came out recently, so you must not have heard of this person.”

“I have heard of him before, but I don’t know much about him. I wonder if there’s a story between this person and Lady Luo?” Lin Yun asked.

With a casual smile, Lin Wan smiled, “What story can they have? Just a lady who fell in love with a heroic character.”

It took Lin Yun great willpower not to throw out the wine in his mouth. If Lil’ Purple were here, she would definitely start calling him a scumbag, but this really had nothing to do with him. Furthermore, wasn’t Luo Shuyi together with the Profound Valley’s Tang Jing?

“Love is the toughest tribulation in the world. That person is truly outstanding, and if nothing happens, it shouldn’t be a problem for him to suppress all the geniuses in the Eastern Desolation or even the holy lands like his senior brother.” Lin Wan sighed. “If I was not a few years older than him, even I might fall for his grace.”

Lin Yun finally couldn’t hold it back and choked on his wine.

Seeing this, Lin Wan smiled, “I’m sorry for that.”

“It’s nothing. I’m only curious about how charming this person is.” Lin Yun said, and he felt weird saying it. After all, he was practically praising himself.
