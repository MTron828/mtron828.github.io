Chapter 1002 - Flower Burial!

The power coming from the divine rune swept towards the demonic spirit controlling Yu Haotian’s body. It felt great pain and screamed as loud as it could. The thunderstorm tore apart the demonic aura and pierced Yu Haotian’s internal organs.

Furthermore, the thunderstorm energy from the divine rune had restricted the surrounding space, which prevented Yu Haotian from escaping. If the demonic spirit knew there was a complete divine rune engraved on the Azure Dragon True Bone, he would never dare to touch it with his hands. Instead, he would try to heavily injure Lin Yun first.

But now, it was too late. Lin Yun had also been waiting for this moment because he just barely managed to refine the Azure Dragon True Bone. In fact, he barely managed to step into the threshold of the Azure Dragon Saint Art. Right now, he could barely merge the dragon runes to form an armor to defend himself. But it was a different story since Yu Haotian touched the divine rune himself.

The Phaseless Demonic Art circulated frantically within Yu Haotian’s body as the demonic spirit tried to resist the infiltration of the divine rune. He was trying his best to break free as he unleashed all of his demonic aura to resist the divine rune. Since Lin Yun hadn’t completely grasped the Azure Dragon True Bone, there was an opportunity to break free.

“Divine Sun Breaking Seal!” Lin Yun naturally knew what was going on and threw a punch at Yu Haotian’s chest. The golden winged human shone behind him as a golden crow appeared in the seal in Lin Yun’s palm. When he clenched his fist, countless golden crows flew out.

“Die!” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with surging killing intent. This punch was aimed at Yu Haotian’s heart in an attempt to kill him before he could break free. When the golden beam pierced through Yu Haotian’s chest, the power of Lin Yun’s punch poured into Yu Haotian’s body.

Yu Haotian threw up blood as he went flying. Once again, he had a huge hole in his chest that spurted with blood. However, Lin Yun noticed something unusual about this situation. His punch managed to tear through Yu Haotian’s skin and muscles, but there was a black demonic luster on Yu Haotian’s bones that protected his heart.

“Phaseless Demonic Art — Reversal Regeneration!” Controlling Yu Haotian’s body, the demonic spirit emitted an ancient aura. Then, black runes began to bloom in Yu Haotian’s chest as he swiftly recovered from his wounds. In a split second, his body was regenerated. When he was done, a torrential aura soared into the sky with a black demonic moon hanging high in the sky.

“That's a demonic fiend aura…” Lin Yun squinted his eyes because he could sense the demonic fiend aura coming from Yu Haotian. Demonic fiends had similarities to the demonic corpses suppressed by Iris Sword Saint in the Azure Sun Realm.

Although he managed to regenerate his injuries, there were repercussions and injuries to Yu Haotian’s vitality. It appeared that Yu Haotian had a demonic spirit living in his body, a remnant demonic spirit of a demonic fiend.

“Tsk, tsk. Demonic fiend? I’m from the noble Divine Ultan Race. We’re an existence far surpassing the likes of you pitiful lifeforms. But your physique is perfect and you even have a complete divine rune engraved on your Azure Dragon True Bone.” Yu Haotian’s eyes glowed like two crimson gems as he didn’t bother to hide his greed.

As space distorted under the demonic moon, no one could hear the conversation between Lin Yun and Yu Haotian.

“You know a lot.” Lin Yun said coldly. He knew that he had to get rid of Yu Haotian or else there would be endless trouble for him in the future. After all, the demonic spirit controlling Yu Haotian even knew the secrets of the Azure Dragon True Bone.

“Hehe. No matter how many secrets you have, all of them will go to me!” Yu Haotian laughed. After he recovered from his injuries, his demonic aura grew to a new height. Then, the demonic moon in the sky began to spin faster, which caused the surroundings to warp.

“I won’t give you any more chances.” Yu Haotian grinned. Executing the movement technique he obtained from the inheritance, he turned into an azure dragon and charged towards Lin Yun.

This scene made Lin Yun squint his eyes. In terms of movement techniques, Lin Yun didn’t fear Yu Haotian’s. Without any hesitation, Lin Yun executed the Golden Crow Nine Transformations and manifested into a golden crow to clash with Yu Haotian.

The clash created a series of explosions with terrifying shockwaves that distorted space. The spectators were shocked and had no idea who would win. But they knew that whoever made it out of this fight alive would shine brightly at the end of the Heavenly Path.

When the terrifying fluctuation passed through space and slammed into everyone, they could feel the terrifying aura. The fight between Lin Yun and Yu Haotian was like a battle between an Azure Dragon and a Golden Crow.

“There’s something wrong with Yu Haotian’s state. He seems to be possessed…” Luo Chen squinted his eyes looking at Yu Haotian.

“Indeed, but it should be a coexisting relationship, not a complete possession. After all, possession will exhaust a great deal of origin energy. Whatever is possessing Yu Haotian must’ve taken an eye on Lin Yun’s treasures or else it wouldn’t take such a big risk,” said Pei Xue. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The Heavenly Path was a legendary battlefield, so it wasn’t rare to find remnant souls. But for a remnant spirit to possess Yu Haotian so perfectly was a surprise. After all, most remnant spirits were weak and wouldn’t dare to appear or else they would be extinguished by the powerful sects.

“Lin Yun is the most terrifying one. He’s actually fighting an ancient spirit evenly. Look, they both have astral flames blazing in their aura oceans…” Qin Lin’s gaze was focused on Lin Yun. His words instantly drew Pei Xue and Luo Chen’s attention because they could sense the crimson flames blazing in Lin Yun’s aura oceans.

Lin Yun was already in the pinnacle second soul Heavenly Soul Realm before the test. So it wasn’t surprising that he could make it into the third soul Heavenly Soul realm. However, they couldn’t figure out what was going on with the astral flames in Lin Yun’s aura oceans.

“It’s Demonic Astral Flowers!” Pei Xue exclaimed because Lin Yun actually subdued Demonic Astral Flowers into his aura oceans. It was a terrifying thought because geniuses from the Kunlun Realm wouldn’t dare to do it. They would only dare to try after reaching the fifth soul Heavenly Soul Realm, but only a very small group would try it. After all, many geniuses had died to the Demonic Astral Flowers.

This meant that Lin Yun status was transcendent. The title transcendent was more terrifying than the title of a genius because transcendents were destined to become saints. Pei Xue was shocked that the ninth Heavenly Path would give birth to a transcendent. She finally figured out why Yue Weiwei paid so much attention to Lin Yun. After all, Lin Yun had also given Pei Xue too many surprises.

Right at this moment, a sword hum echoed out of Lin Yun as he grabbed the Flower Burial Sword. Unleashing his sky sword intent, he was ready to face Yu Haotian. Suddenly, the crowd realized that Lin Yun hadn’t been using his sky sword intent. They were confident that Lin Yun’s strength would soar. It seemed like Lin Yun had no intention of letting Yu Haotian live.

When Lin Yun’s hair fluttered in the wind, every single strand of his hair glowed with golden brilliance. His sword intent rose rapidly as he prepared his attack.

“Flower Burial!”

“The Flower Burial Sword is coming out!” Everyone could feel their blood boil at this scene. After all, Lin Yun only used one sword to kill Mu Xiuhan’s group of three. At this moment, they were excited to witness the grace of Lin Yun’s sword once more.

“Divine Glorysun Sword — Cloud Dispelling Sun!” Lin Yun roared as he swung his sword. Instantly, the clouds were torn apart from a boundless sun surging violently.
