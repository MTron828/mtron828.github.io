Chapter 1865 - Ye Guhan

Everyone was dumbfounded when the woman turned into Tian Xuanzi, including the Quasi-Saint of the Divine Phoenix Mountain. After all, no one would expect that the famous Profound Sky Great Saint would disguise himself as a woman.

“H-How is this possible?!” Lin Yun was completely dumbfounded, with surprise filling his pupils.

But he soon regained his composure. If the woman was Tian Xuanzi, it was no wonder why he felt that she was familiar, having a feeling that he had seen that woman somewhere before.

It all made sense now. Tian Xuanzi had even previously probed to see if he possessed a Divine Dragon Bone, not to mention how he took care of Qin Tian back at the Black Tortoise Void Sea.

But this made Lin Yun feel a chill run down his spine because Tian Xuanzi was too terrifying. Tian Xuanzi even resorted to disguising himself as a woman to get close to him. If his identity had been exposed back then, there was no doubt that Tian Xuanzi would have killed him on the spot.

As for the white-clothed man? Lin Yun had no idea who he was, and he was puzzled.

“Holy shit, my heart’s blood was dug out by someone as disgusting as him?!” Lin Yun could still maintain his composure, but Gu Jun cursed on the spot. He now knew why he felt uneasy when he first saw Tian Xuanzi.

Not too far away, Mei Zihua and An Liuyan were also dumbfounded and couldn’t accept this scene before them.

Right then, blood dripped from Mu Xueling’s lips when she played her flute, and her face became pale with signs of falling.

Seeing this, Lin Yun stepped forth and placed his hand on Mu Xueling’s back. After Mu Xueling regained her footing, she took a deep breath and barely recovered.

“So, it’s the Profound Sky Great Saint. I apologize for being rude earlier, and I hope that you can overlook this.” The Divine Phoenix Mountain’s Quasi-Saint said with an ugly expression, but he didn’t have a choice but to apologize. Even if the Divine Phoenix Mountain had a long inheritance and was much stronger than the Profound Sky Sect, Tian Xuanzi was a Great Saint.

Tian Xuanzi was a Great Saint standing at the top of the pyramid, and he could use a finger to kill him if he wanted to. Not only did he ridicule Tian Xuanzi when he was in his disguise earlier, but he even made a move against him. So there was no doubt that Tian Xuanzi had a reason to make a move against him as well.

Tian Xuanzi stood in mid-air as though he belonged to a portrait. His beauty was unreal and out of this world, born a man with a feminine look.

“It doesn’t matter. You should not be blamed because you didn’t know about it earlier.” Tian Xuanzi didn’t hold it against the Divine Phoenix Mountain’s Quasi-Saint and waved his hand to summon Zhuge Qingyun over to him.

“Master, this disciple is useless and should be punished.” Zhuge Qingyun immediately cupped his hands when he came over to Tian Xuanzi.

“It doesn’t matter. Don’t forget that he’s someone that even I failed to kill.” Tian Xuanzi’s gaze fell onto Lin Yun, and he smiled, “Young lad, we meet again.”

Lin Yun had no expression on his face, and simply ignored Tian Xuanzi.

But Tian Xuanzi wasn’t bothered about it, and he squinted his eyes, “But… should I call you the Champion of the Nirvana Banquet or Flower Burial?”

Flower Burial? The faces of the five holy lands changed. They might not take it to heart if someone else said it, but they couldn’t help taking it seriously since it came from Tian Xuanzi. After all, Tian Xuanzi was a Great Saint who could fight the Radiant Sword Saint.

Everyone’s gazes involuntarily fell on Lin Yun, who stood with his hands behind him. He had long given Yue Weiwei to Mu Xueling. When he raised his head, he softly said, “If you want to kill me, it doesn’t matter if I’m Flower Burial or the Champion of the Nirvana Banquet.”

“It does matter.” Tian Xuanzi’s smile remained undiminished, then he suddenly made a move with immense pressure crashing down on Lin Yun.

The immense pressure made Lin Yun’s bones begin to crackle with pain on his face, and his Divine Tortoise Transformation was slowly disintegrating.

Tian Xuanzi’s face also gradually became grave because Lin Yun had yet to show his true self, which naturally baffled him. Thus, he pushed his palm forth even more.

Knowing that his identity would be exposed today, Lin Yun sighed in his heart. But he felt a little relieved because who would want to disguise themselves and hide if they had a choice?

“You don’t have to trouble yourself. That’s right; I’m Lin Yun.” Before Tian Xuanzi unleashed his pressure again, Lin Yun took several steps back and rotated in mid-air before landing on the ocean. His appearance underwent a drastic transformation from Lin Xiao to Lin Yun.

His white clothes fluttered in the wind with a purple mark on his forehead. His flawless and handsome face was revealed before everyone.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“It’s really him!” Everyone in the surroundings was shocked. After all, Lin Yun’s face was too familiar to everyone. After the battle in the Ancient Barren Domain, the name ‘Flower Burial’ had long spread throughout the Kunlun Realm, along with his portrait.

So even those who had never met Lin Yun before could recognize his appearance. There were rumors that Lin Yun had died because of his heavy injuries after the battle in the Ancient Barren Domain, and many people believed it because it had been a long time since Lin Yun showed himself. Even if Lin Yun was alive, he would hide and not dare to show himself in public.

“He’s Lin Yun?” Xiao Yuanqi was filled with disbelief after watching how Lin Xiao transformed into Lin Yun.

“How is this possible?!” Not far away, Ji Lingfeng was also dumbfounded.

All the Quasi-Saints present were also shocked, including the Quasi-Saint from the Divine Phoenix Mountain. Who could have thought that Lin Xiao was Lin Yun? Who could have thought that Lin Yun did not hide, but disguised himself as Lin Xiao, obtaining first on the Dragon Pulse Ranking and becoming the Champion of the Nirvana Banquet?

Not to mention that he fought with a Quasi-Saint head-on, nearly killing the other party.

“Flower Burial…” Yi Feng of the Myriad Lightning Sect and Lin Qingyang of the Divine Dao Pavilion also had shock on their faces.

Lin Xiao was really Lin Yun. This shocked the Quasi-Saints so greatly that they had yet to come to their senses. Lin Yun possessed the Firmament Saint Cloth, and he was also the disciple of the Radiant Sword Saint. This was probably the reason why Tian Xuanzi came.

Zhuge Qingyun was also shocked, standing beside Tian Xuanzi, and coldly said, “Lin Yun, you’re really bold to dare to show yourself.”

“Why don’t I dare? I’m not a criminal, and I’m upright. I just regret that I failed to kill you earlier.” Lin Yun said coldly, glaring at Zhuge Qingyun.

Zhuge Qingyun’s face changed. That sword from before was the greatest humiliation that he had suffered in his lifetime.

“So you’re the one who injured Qingyun. Lin Yun, you have given me a great surprise. Come with me.” Tian Xuanzi said.

Right then, Mu Xueling took out a medal. It was a golden medal containing a noble and majestic aura.

“The Imperial Dragon Order!” Zhuge Qingyun’s face changed when he saw the medal. The Empress bestowed the Imperial Dragon Order personally, and seeing the medal was the same as seeing the Empress.

Tian Xuanzi calmly cupped his hands, “I pay my greetings to the Divine Dragon Envoy. Qingyun, quickly pay your respects.”

Zhuge Qingyun quickly cupped his hands together in Mu Xueling’s direction.

“Tian Xuanzi, since you recognize this medal, return to where you come from. Lin Yun can’t die today.” Mu Xueling said indifferently as she looked at Tian Xuanzi.

“The Divine Dragon Envoy with the Imperial Dragon Order, who in the world dare not to respect you? Anyone with the Imperial Dragon Order represents the Empress herself in the outside world.” Tian Xuanzi smiled. His tone suddenly changed as he spoke, “Everyone in the world thinks that I want to kill Lin Yun, but I have never said that. Everyone in the world has misunderstood me, including the Divine Dragon Envoy and the Radiant Sword Saint. I only want to bring Lin Yun to the Divine Dragon Empire and meet the Empress. I never once said that I wanted his life.”

His words were confusing, instantly making everyone speechless, not knowing how to refute them.

But Lin Yun coldly said, “Tian Xuanzi, you’re shameless. Don’t tell me that you were not behind the annihilation of the Sword Sect’s Golden Generation two decades ago. You’re not the one who imprisoned my senior brother, Jian Jingtian, in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect? You dare deny that you’re not the one who forced my master out of his seclusion when he’s facing his tribulation?”

“The annihilation of the Sword Sect and death of the Radiant Sword Saint is just the trend. The Ancient Barren Domain hasn't had an Emperor for a long time. Since the Radiant Sword Saint can’t be that Emperor, I’ll be that Emperor in his stead. You can’t save the Sword Sect and your master with your words alone, so you better follow me back obediently.” Tian Xuanzi said calmly.

“Come at me if you have the guts. Since I could kill the Nether Divinity Ancestor back then, I can also kill you today.” Lin Yun said indifferently.

Hearing that, Tian Xuanzi’s face turned cold, and his smile gradually faded.

“You have yet to completely recover from your injuries, right?” Lin Yun raised his head and coldly looked at Tian Xuanzi. The Sword Emperor, Yu Qingfeng, shattered Tian Xuanzi’s saint pulses, destroying a hundred years of cultivation from Tian Xuanzi. So there was no doubt that Tian Xuanzi’s injuries were much heavier than his.

When Lin Yun said that, Tian Xuanzi’s face sank, and he indifferently said, “You would’ve killed me if you could. You managed to kill the Nether Divinity Ancestor because he was careless. Do you think that I will fall for it twice?”

“You can come and give it a try.” Lin Yun fearlessly looked at Tian Xuanzi. It was true that Lin Yun could no longer activate the Firmament Saint Cloth on his own accord, and he would die before he could kill Tian Xuanzi if he did. But it would be a different story if Tian Xuanzi attacked him. The Firmament Saint Cloth would be activated by itself then, and he would make Tian Xuanzi lose half of his life even if he couldn’t kill the latter.

“You think I don’t dare?” Tian Xuanzi smiled coldly and waved his hand, unleashing an immense saint aura.

Mu Xueling wanted to stop him, but the sheer force of the aura pushed her away.

The purple flower on Tian Xuanzi’s shoulder bloomed with countless petals flying out, forming a purple floral domain that separated the outside world, covering a few thousand miles of radius.

Mu Xueling tried several times, but she couldn’t break through the invisible barrier, no matter how she tried. She might seem calm, but her pupils were filled with anxiety. “Even if the Pavilion Master is here herself, there’s nothing she can do about this domain.”

“Tian Xuanzi, don’t even think about hurting my junior brother!” A roar echoed from the heavens and earth, causing the domain that Tian Xuanzi created to tremble.

A white-clothed man appeared out of nowhere with a boundless sword intent released from his body, causing all thirty-six layers of heaven to shatter. The white cloth enveloping him swiftly unfolded before they flew out like sword rays, easily tearing apart the domain that Tian Xuanzi had created.

When the white cloth and purple flower clashed, the sheer collision alone created a devastating power, and the shockwave emitted from it made everyone’s scalps numb.

Tian Xuanzi and the white-clothed man stood in mid-air as they began forming seals. As they clashed in mid-air, they were both radiating a terrifying aura. When the white cloth flew out, it revealed a white swordsman with a youthful appearance.

He had a handsome and extraordinary appearance. The white cloth exploded when he flicked his finger, instantly tearing the floral domain into pieces. This made the floral fragments and white cloth blend together, putting the entire domain in chaos.

When the floral domain was on the brink of collapsing, the white-clothed swordsman retrieved Lin Yun from the domain. He smiled, “Tian Xuanzi, don’t even think about hurting my junior brother!”

When the floral domain was torn apart, Tian Xuanzi took several steps back, his face becoming pale. This is because he lost in the previous clash, making his aura uneasy.

Seeing this, everyone instantly knew that Tian Xuanzi had yet to recover from his injuries. But Tian Xuanzi coldly looked at the white-clothed swordsman and muttered, “Ye Guhan!”
