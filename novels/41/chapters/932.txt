Chapter 933 - Who Wants to Fight Me!

Flamecloud City was initially a small city in the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm. It was so small that it couldn’t really be called a city. It was mainly used as a place for geniuses to rest before heading into the forbidden realm.

However, due to the commotion caused by Lin Yun, it became the center of attention.

The usually small gatherings became so packed that the area felt suffocating. For over ten days, cultivators gathered to witness Lin Yun and the Bloodbone Realm fight.

The Bloodbone Realm arrived after five days, but Lin Yun was nowhere to be seen. Rumors floated around that Lin Yun was just playing with the Bloodbone Realm. After all, why would a single individual challenge an entire realm by himself, not to mention a top-tier higher realm.

The Bloodbone Realm even had two people who were in the third soul, which was practically invincible in the Heavenly Path. Unless they ran into a real powerhouse, there was no reason for a third soul Heavenly Soul Realm to feel afraid. So it made sense that Lin Yun was fooling the Bloodbone Realm to buy time for himself.

As long as Lin Yun could make it to the end of the Heavenly Path, no one would be able to say anything. This was especially true since it wasn’t a fair fight for Lin Yun.

However, not everyone held the same thoughts. At the very least, geniuses from the higher realms were hoping that Lin Yun would die a terrible death at the hands of the Bloodbone Realm. So when Lin Yun didn’t show up immediately, they spread nasty rumors about him.

They constantly mocked Lin Yun with claims that an ant couldn’t have such courage.

“It’s already been ten days, where is he?” A few people in the Bloodbone Realm’s camp felt depressed when they didn’t see Lin Yun. They came early and spent five whole days waiting for Lin Yun. They had to endure the laughter of the higher realms, which made them feel miserable.

After losing Feng Wuji and being humiliated through Yuan Hengtian, the Bloodbone Realm’s reputation was at rock bottom. The only way they could salvage this situation was by getting rid of Lin Yun. So when Lin Yun didn’t immediately show up, everyone from the Bloodbone Realm lost their patience.

Yuan Hengtian was the most anxious person present because he was the one who delivered Lin Yun’s message. In his mind, he would be the shame of the Bloodbone Realm if Lin Yun didn’t show up. What he didn’t know was that he was already the shame of the Bloodbone Realm.

He was the reason why the Bloodbone Realm became a laughing stock. So if Lin Yun didn’t show up, Liu Mu would destroy him.

“He’ll come,” said Yuan Hengtian unconfidently.

“Hmph. If he doesn’t show, you should leave the Heavenly Path,” said a Bloodbone Realm cultivator.

“Don’t worry, he will come,” said Kong Xuan as he slowly opened his eyes. He was the second strongest genius from the Bloodbone Realm, and his strength was acknowledged by everyone. He was especially famous due to his Azure Dragon Ranking.

“As a swordsman, he will honor his word,” said Kong Xuan. At this moment, he was giving off an unfathomable and mysterious aura.

For the higher realms, reaching the first soul and second soul was easy if one had enough resources. The third soul was when they had to be cautious or else they would die. So anyone who could overcome the third tribulation was a genuine monster, and Kong Xuan was exactly that.

“A swordsman can’t make promises haphazardly. If they break their promise, they will damage their heart. He probably had a plan when he set the date for us to meet. He’s probably trying to break through to the first soul,” explained Kong Xuan calmly.

When everyone heard Kong Xuan’s explanation, they calmed down. However, one person still felt uneasy. “Then weren’t we fooled by him? We should’ve killed him during his tribulation. That would have been a lot easier for us to deal with.”

“That would have no meaning. If we made a move before the deadline, we would have broken our promise. He could have easily used that as an excuse to run away. Plus, with his strength, is anyone confident they can defeat him? Only senior brother Liu and I are capable of dealing with him, and we don’t want to waste our time. This is the best method for us to save time and make it to the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm.”

“Furthermore…” Kong Xuan sneered, “Why would we need to disrupt his tribulation? He’s only in the first soul.”

Kong Xuan spoke with confidence that came from being on the Azure Dragon Ranking. Clearly, he never placed Lin Yun in his eyes.

“With Senior Brother Kong here, Lin Yun will definitely die!”

“That’s right. He’s really arrogant if he thinks he can challenge our Bloodbone Realm. Senior Brother Kong and Senior Brother Liu can crush him anytime they want.”Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Killing him is too easy. We have to make him kneel and beg for his life once he arrives.”

“Who is this Flower Burial? What a clown.” Naturally, everyone was confident in Kong Xuan’s strength.

Suddenly, Kong Xuan’s eyes became playful as he smiled. He slowly stood up because he could sense a powerful sword intent approaching the city.

“He’s here,” said Kong Xuan. Everyone from the Bloodbone Realm collected themselves when they heard that.

“Let’s go and give him a warm welcome.” Kong Xuan flew into the sky and charged towards the city walls with the other elites from the Bloodbone Realm following behind him.

As they traveled through the air, everyone else in the city began to follow. All of them wanted to see who this Lin Yun person was.

At the far end of the horizon, a figure was rapidly approaching the city. The aura he gave off was similar to a sword as he pierced through the sky.

“It’s Lin Yun!”

“He really came. How arrogant! He’s basically asking to die.”

“Yeah. Does he really think the Bloodbone Realm is easy to deal with?”

“He’s just courting death!”

The entire city bustled with talk as Lin Yun approached. The higher realms spoke with disdain and mocked Lin Yun while the others expressed concern for Lin Yun’s safety.

However, no one was optimistic about Lin Yun. They felt that Lin Yun didn’t have the strength or backing to challenge the entire Bloodbone Realm. Plus, Lin Yun’s cultivation was so weak.

Lin Yun approached the city in his azure colored clothes. Like usual, he was carrying a sword box and the purple mark on his forehead gave him a bewitching aura. Only three years had passed and the youth who came from the Azure Sky Sect had grown into a fine man.

When some of the women in the city looked at Lin Yun, they couldn’t help blushing. All of the rumors about Lin Yun failed to mention how handsome he was.

Lil’ Red was also attracting people’s attention. After all, the crowd was familiar with the story of Lin Yun’s pet stripping down Yuan Hengtian.

With a smile on his face, Lin Yun landed on the city wall and shouted, “Flower Burial Lin Yun is here. Who wants to fight me?”

With that, Lin Yun’s voice echoed through the city.
