Chapter 1300 - Transcendent

The underground palace was vast, and there were geniuses from everywhere searching for treasures. This place was located in the depths of the Profound Wither Island, and the fact that they could come this far was enough to speak for their strength.

So there were countless people gathered in the ruins, and they would compete amongst themselves whenever a treasure appeared. This region had never been calm, and even if it was calm, it was just the calm before the storm, and the longer it lasted, this meant the more ferocious the storm would be.

Without any signs, the heavens and earth began to tremble, and everyone within a few myriad miles in radius could feel the terrifying fluctuations. The heavens and earth were trembling violently, which made the surroundings look like an apocalypse. This was sudden and took many people by surprise.

Before they could respond in time, many people threw out mouthfuls of blood from the shockwave, and they could see a massive pillar of light soaring into the sky. When the beam of light reached the horizon, a loud explosion resounded, and the heavens and earth began to change.

The surroundings suddenly became dark with bolts of lightning streaking across the horizon. This phenomenon was terrifying, and the terrifying aura made everyone feel their hearts beating wildly.

“What’s going on?”

“It looks like a treasure or some sort has appeared… but it doesn’t look like it at the same time…”

“I’m afraid someone has triggered a restriction of some sort. This energy fluctuation is too terrifying.” Many Elysium Core Realm experts have gathered within this massive ruin, and they all wore grave expressions. They had high eyesight, and could tell that this wasn’t a phenomenon created by the appearance of a treasure. There wasn’t any spiritual energy fluctuation, elixir fragrance, or aura of any saint artifacts.

There was only an ancient and destructive energy explosion, and such a scene wasn’t rare on the Profound Wither Island. But a phenomenon of this level was rare. This made them curious about what sort of opportunity appeared to create a phenomenon of this level.

At the same time, those who could make it here were all Elysium Core Realm experts, and they weren’t weak from the fact that they would come this far out from the few hundred thousand Empyreans. Tens of thousands of Elysium Core Realm experts were looking at the pillar of light as it soared into the sky, blooming with a dazzling light.

“There’s someone there!” Everyone was startled and exclaimed. Looking from afar, everyone could tell that those people were transcendent geniuses with just a glance, instantly making them change their minds. They knew that this wasn’t something they could interfere in, and they would die if they got close.

Suddenly, the surrounding exclamations became even louder, “Emerald Jade Manor’s Fang Muyang ranked eighteenth on the Empyrean Ranking!”

“Heavenly Blade Pavilion’s Ye Xun ranked fifteenth on the Empyrean Ranking!”

“Thunder Sect’s Xia Yunzhen ranked sixteenth on the Empyrean Ranking!” Everyone’s faces changed when they saw the faces of the three transcendent geniuses, and took huge blows in their hearts.

After all, the eight strongest sects were famous in the Ancient Barren Domain, and their appearance would definitely set off a huge shock. Now that three of the strongest sects have gathered, how could they not be shocked? At the same time, they also had a feeling that the treasures down below were shocking.

“Who’s that silver-clothed youth?”

“Xia Yunzhen and the rest are chasing after him. Can it be that he obtained the treasure?”

“Something’s weird…” Very quickly, everyone was shocked when they discovered Lin Yun. They couldn’t believe that someone actually dared to face the three strongest sects. Wasn’t he afraid of death?

Let’s not mention that Xia Yunzhen and the rest were transcendent geniuses, to begin with. They were also from one of the eight strongest sects of the Ancient Barren Domain. The disciples of those strongest sects have been arrogant on the Profound Wither Island, and no one dared to provoke them.

After all, no one dared to provoke the eight strongest sects, even if they had a huge number of people. That was because everyone knew that the eight strongest sects not only had Dragon Pulse Realm experts outside the Profound Wither Island, there were even Samsara Edict Realm experts. So it was simply an act of death to stand against those powerful sects.

“Hand the Dragon Saint Pellet over and I can spare you from death!”

“You want to live after seizing the quasi-saint origin? You think you can escape?!” Just when everyone was shocked, cold voices filled with killing auras resounded.

The three transcendent geniuses were enveloped in towering killing auras that soared to the sky. Their astral energies were ferociously gathered within their bodies, and the auras that they were giving off were extremely shocking.

Dragon Saint Pellet? Quasi-Saint Origin? Everyone was shocked when they heard that and couldn’t figure out the origin of that silver-clothed youth. This made everyone take in a cold breath, and they could feel a chill run down their spines.

Lin Yun’s sword intent could sense that there was three powerful aura soaring to the sky, and they were the Greater Elysium Core Realm experts who supported the collapse of the underground palace earlier. Aside from that, there were also many elites from the three sects gathering together.

Since he couldn’t escape, then he would give them a fight, since they wanted it! Lin Yun had no fear on his face under the Silver Moon Mask. He was radiating brightly with his silver hair fluttering in the wind, while the three people were chasing him.

“So, have you thought it through?” Fang Muyang fanned the fan in his hand and pridefully looked at Lin Yun. When he saw that Lin Yun was donned in silver clothes with his hair fluttering in the wind under the night, he couldn’t help being furious.

After all, Lin Yun had made him humiliate himself in the underground palace, and just thinking about it alone was enough to make him feel terrible. Both Ye Xun and Xia Yunzhen were coldly looking at Lin Yun. They had no intention of letting him live, and they sealed his path of retreat from all directions.

Suddenly, the three’s auras linked together and restricted the surrounding space. This was very terrifying, and even time seemed to stop under the restriction. So Lin Yun could only fend off the light close to himself, but couldn’t release it.

“So, the three transcendent geniuses want to make a move on me?” Lin Yun sneered as a killing aura began to brewe within his pupils.

“It’s good that you understand. We don’t have to be so direct, we’re here to suppress you today!” Xia Yunzhen said while tugging his arms together.

“I don’t wish to take advantage of you, so jand hand over the Dragon Saint Pellet and Quasi-Saint Origin. Otherwise, don’t blame me for bullying you!” Ye Xun coldly said. He was feeling vexed because he didn’t want to join hands with others as a transcendent genius. Whether it’s the Dragon Saint Pellet or the Quasi-Saint Origin, the values were unimaginably huge, so he had no choice but to be cautious. He might as well flip the table directly.

It was simply unheard of that three transcendent geniuses were facing a single person on the Profound Wither Island. Xia Yunzhen and the other two were confident, so they didn’t place Lin Yun in their eyes. Even if Lin Yun managed to flee from them, they had Greater Elysium Core Realm experts behind them, so they weren’t worried.

As mockery flashed through Fang Muyang’s pupils, he snickered, “Someone like you is the standard of not wanting any face. I invited you out of goodwill, and something like this wouldn’t have happened if you agreed to it back then.”

“Do I need to give you face? I’m only thinking about how your expressions will look when the three of you can’t take me down.” Lin Yun ridiculed. He didn’t have any fear on his face behind the Silver Moon Mask. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“How arrogant. I alone am enough to destroy you!” Xia Yunzhen made his move first. His astral energy exploded with lightning and flames enveloping the entire sky. When he threw his punch out, the space around it collapsed.

Right at that moment, the thousand purple-golden dragon runes on Lin Yun’s body began to bloom with thunderstorms gathering and his silver hair fluttered in the wind before he threw his punch out. His punch even caused the heavens and earth to lightly tremble, unleashing a terrifying fluctuation in the path of his punch.

This made Fang Muyang and Ye Xun both surprised by the strength of Lin Yun’s physique. When their attacks collided, Lin Yun didn’t even retreat by half an inch. On the other hand, Xia Yunzhen was forced to take ten-odd steps back with blood dripping down from his palm. This left him shocked.

“Is that all you got? Looks like the transcendent geniuses of the eight strongest sects don’t seem that impressive after all. Your strength isn’t that much different from those from big sects,” muttered Lin Yun after he managed to gauge Xia Yunzhen’s strength. When Xia Yunzhen heard Lin Yun’s evaluation, his face immediately became black. As a transcendent genius of the thunder sect, how could he possibly be compared to those from big sects?

“Die!” Xia Yunzhen roared and summoned his constellation. His constellation was an ocean consisting of lightning and flames.

This was why transcendent geniuses were so troublesome for Lin Yun. Their strength would undergo a huge transformation after they summoned their constellations, and he knew that he couldn’t face their constellations with the Innate Azure Dragon Saint Physique alone.

Without any reservations, Lin Yun circulated the Azure Dragon Saint Art and purple-golden dragon runes began to converge before radiating brightly and unleashing a terrifying dragon aura. As the purple and gold light converged, an azure dragon was manifested and unleashed a roar.

When the draconic roar echoed, both Ye Xun and Fang Muyang were forced to defend themselves. When they raised their heads again, they were shocked because the silver-clothed youth didn’t bring out his constellation, but relied on the azure dragon to face the constellation head-on.

After ten-odd exchanges later, Xia Yunzhen was sent flying back while throwing a mouthful of blood. This scene left all the spectators shocked. They began to wonder who the hell the masked man was because he was a little too powerful.

“You want to kill me with that level?” Lin Yun sneered, and his words nearly made Xia Yunzhen throw out another mouthful of blood. But Lin Yun didn’t let it go so easily and continued to mock, “No wonder you guys have to join forces. It turns out that you guys are pretty weak. Alright, you guys can come at me at the same time, then.”

Hearing his mockery, the faces of Xia Yunzhen and the other two instantly became black.
