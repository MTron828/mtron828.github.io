Chapter 1077 - Time to Settle Debts!

While Lin Yun was making a final push in his sky sword intent, the Nether Divinity Realm Son and his companions were swimming deeper into the lake. The Nether Divinity Realm Son was using various means to break through the restriction of the lake that stunned his companions.

They knew that the restriction beneath the lake was terrifying, but the Nether Divinity Realm Son actually managed to break through them easily. Fortunately, no one else was searching the bottom of the lake like them. After all, the legendary Nine-Leaf Saint Fruit was located at the bottom of the lake.

The two speculated that the Nether Divinity Realm Son must’ve heard something from an elder or else his current actions wouldn’t make sense. Then again, the elder couldn’t have expected that the Nether Divinity Realm Son would lose an arm to Lin Yun.

Suddenly, light shined in the eyes of all three Realm Sons as they sensed a dense floral fragrance. They could faintly see the outline of a fruit enveloped in a divine aura. Greed shined in their eyes as they exclaimed, “The Nine-Leaf Saint Fruit!”

“Don’t move!” The Nether Divinity Realm Son’s voice sounded out. “Each of the nine elders are in charge of restricting a section of this area. There’s no way one can obtain the fruit without the help of the nine elders. Otherwise, we will be facing death.”

Disappointment flashed in the eyes of the other two Realm Sons when they heard the explanation. The Profound Dragon Realm Son spoke in a disappointed tone, “Then why did you bring us here? The only thing that’s here is floral fragrance, not floral saint liquid. Even if we refine it all, it won’t help in the final battle.”

“Really? Why don’t you try refining some then,” sneered the Nether Divinity Realm Son.

The two other Realm Sons exchanged a glance as they tried to refine the floral fragrance. When the floral fragrance entered their bodies, they could sense their origin energy blazing within their bodies. The Profound Dragon Realm Son exclaimed, “What’s going on?”

“This is the primal floral fragrance that has been accumulating for thousands of years. Refining a bit can greatly boost our strength. You two felt the side effects, right?” said the Nether Divinity Realm Son.

When the Profound Dragon Realm Son heard that, his face changed. The floral fragrance was definitely a lot better than the floral saint liquid, but the cons were also obvious. There were too many impurities, so they would need a long time to refine the impurities out of their bodies. The Elysium Trigram Realm Son fell into deep thoughts and said, “It’s not a problem for us to refine the impurities in the future with our clan’s foundation. The most important right now is to strengthen ourselves.”

“That’s right!” The Nether Divinity Realm Son said. “Let them fight while we strengthen ourselves. By the time everything finishes, we might be able to win it all.”

After making their decision, the three of them sat down and began to refine the floral fragrance. Shortly after, the three of them began to emit dazzling radiance as they were strengthened at an unbelievable speed. However, the three of them didn’t notice that there was a sword hovering above the Nine-Leaf Saint Fruit where the floral fragrance was the densest.

As the sword flickered, boundless floral fragrance drilled into the sword. At the same time, runes could be seen transforming on the surface of the sword.

It didn’t take long for an hour to pass with everyone competing for floral saint liquid. The refinement of the floral saint liquid caused many people to undergo a drastic transformation. It seemed like everyone was glowing purple as floral fragrance covered them. The denser the glow, the more floral saint liquid one refined.

When the Imperial Feather Realm Son opened his eyes, he smiled, “Time’s up.”

His voice wasn’t loud, but it had caused a great fluctuation in the Saint Spiritual Lake. Everyone knew that the competition for the championship was officially beginning. With that, the short peace came to an end as the five Realm Sons opened their eyes. It seemed like all of them recovered a vast majority of their vitality.

The five Realm Sons exchanged a glance before someone asked, “Imperial Feather Realm Son, how do you think we should compete?”

“I’m okay with any method, even if the five of you work together,” smiled the Imperial Feather Realm Son.

“Haha, you must be joking. We’re Realm Sons! How can we lower ourselves to that level? Since we’re going for a fair fight, I believe that there’s also no need for us to use our holy spirit martial techniques. Let me go first!” As that person spoke, he also stood up on the ground.

“That’s fine with me,” said the Imperial Feather Realm Son.

“You’re the strongest among us, but it won’t be easy for you to become the champion!” The Royal Wind Realm Son said as azure flames blazed on his arms.

The Imperial Feather Realm Son was facing the challenge seriously, so he began to form seals while a barrier of light formed around him. Simultaneously, the Royal Wind Realm Son moved and used one punch to destroy the barrier.

With the azure flames gathered in his fist, the Royal Wind Realm Son unleashed a terrifying power that reached the Imperial Feather Realm Son.

It was easy to imagine how powerful the punch was as the spectators held their breath in anticipation. However, the Imperial Feather Realm Son didn’t have any anxiety in his eyes. Without a change to his face, the Imperial Feather Realm Son allowed the punch to land on his chest. The Royal Wind Realm Son was shocked when he saw this because he knew he couldn’t bear the consequences of killing the Imperial Feather Realm Son.

But his shock only lasted a brief moment before his eyes flashed coldly. As soon the flames on his punch were about to explode, he was sent flying. The Imperial Feather Realm Son was unaffected by the attack, but the Royal Wind Realm Son had many injuries.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“How is this possible?!” The crowd had disbelief on their faces as they fell silent.

A little while later, another Realm Son stood up, “The Fang Origin Realm Son will challenge the Imperial Feather Realm Son.”

He didn’t have much confidence in his tone because he knew how strong the Imperial Feather Realm Son was. After all, the Royal Wind Realm Son’s failure was clearly etched in his mind. His plan was simple, force the Imperial Feather Realm Son to attack.

Taking a step forward, boundless origin energy began to blaze on the Fang Origin Realm Son as an ancient tree bloomed behind him. The tree continued to grow as it was empowered by six aura oceans. As the Fang Origin Realm Son approached the Imperial Feather Realm Son, the power of his ancient tree grew even more powerful. Strangely, the tree branches made it look like a dragon was coiled around the tree.

“True Dragon’s Touch!” The Fang Origin Realm Son roared as the ancient tree soared into the sky before charging towards the Imperial Feather Realm Son. He wanted to use this move to tangle up the Imperial Feather Realm Son and exhaust the latter’s energy.

The commotion created by the attack was terrifying, but the Imperial Feather Realm Son merely took nine unhurried steps. Then, his aura reached an unprecedented height while his powerful martial intent was unleashed.

The Imperial Feather Realm Son merely pushed his palm out to destroy the Fang Origin Realm Son’s attack. His attack was actually so strong that it even hit the Fang Origin Realm Son’s chest. The Fang Origin Realm Son let out a groan as his surrounding origin energy was shattered into pieces. Turning into a beam, he flew away as fast as possible.

No one could believe the might of the Imperial Feather Realm Son right now. They all knew that he was strong, but no one expected him to be this strong. The Imperial Feather Realm Son swept a glance out at the three remaining realm sons and said, “You guys can come at me together.”

A radiating light exploded out of the Imperial Feather Realm Son that made the remaining Realm Sons unhappy. Seeing that the Imperial Feather Realm Son had underestimated them, the three of them roared and charged toward the Imperial Feather Realm Son. Unleashing the Demonic Astral Flowers in their aura oceans, they brought out their full strength.

With the three of them working together, they emitted a terrifying aura. But just when both sides were about to clash, the light of a divine rune bloomed on the Imperial Feather Realm Son’s body while a black vortex appeared behind him. When the black vortex appeared, it instantly devoured all the phenomena and light in the world.

In the next second, an ancient aura exploded out as the Imperial Feather Realm Son threw out a punch. The collision was so strong that both parties were sent flying away. But when the Imperial Feather Realm Son took three steps back to stabilize himself, the three Realm Sons were still flying through the air.

“Divine rune!” The realm sons were shocked as they looked at the Imperial Feather Realm Son. They understood why the Royal Wind Realm Son was heavily injured when he attacked the Imperial Feather Realm Son. The Imperial Feather Realm Son had a divine rune imprinted in his body.

The Imperial Feather Realm Son spoke coldly, “Did you all think that I didn’t have any confidence in stealing Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon True Bone? Honestly, his Azure Dragon True Bone’s origin surpassed my imagination. Anyway, it seems like the Azure Dragon True Bone belongs to me. Are there any objections?”

The five Realm Sons looked at each other with unwillingness, but there was nothing they could do. Although they knew that there was no way the Imperial Feather Realm Son could take all five of their holy spirit martial techniques together, they knew that it wouldn’t be easy. If they used this method, they would have a falling out with the Imperial Feather Realm Son. At that time, no one would say a word if the Imperial Feather Realm Son slaughtered all of them.

“It looks like there are no objections,” smiled the Imperial Feather Realm Son. “Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon True Bone belongs to me now. I hope that none of you will accuse me of taking advantage of you.”

Right at this moment, a faint voice sounded out from the bottom of the Saint Spiritual Lake, “Since when did my Azure Dragon True Bone belong to you? Where did any of you get the qualification to make decisions without me?”

When the voice finished speaking, a powerful sword intent exploded from the bottom of the lake. Then, a figure soared into the sky, which caused everyone to look on with shock. The figure hovered in the air and glared at the Imperial Feather Realm Son coldly. His clothes were stained with his blood, which proved that he had a near death experience.

Although he looked exhausted, he stood up straight like a mighty sword. “Imperial Feather, it’s time to settle our grudge!”
