Chapter 1875 - Indigo Thunder Peak's Chief Disciple

Lin Yun still hadn’t gotten used to his disguise as Ye Qingtian when he had just arrived in the Heavenly Dao Sect. So he couldn’t get used to the many disdainful gazes from the surroundings, especially from an acquaintance like Xiao Yuanqi. But this also meant that his Divine Tortoise Transformation had improved, and not even Xiao Yuanqi could see through his disguise. But he had a feeling that he was tricked by his senior brother.

Lin Yun followed the group and left the city before arriving at the entrance of the Heavenly Dao Sect. There were two towering peaks that have reached over ten thousand feet and looked like two swords from afar. The entrance was between the two peaks.

Many inner disciples were queuing up before the two peaks, and anyone could sense the hidden threat within the surrounding mist. Evidently, there was a powerful sword array laid around the two mountains. This was probably the reason why Lil’ Purple didn’t dare to intrude.

Lin Yun took out a medal he had already prepared and followed Xiao Yuanqi’s group into the Heavenly Dao Sect’s inner sect. The surrounding scenery completely differed from the outside cities when they entered the inner sect. It was a whole new world, and the density of spiritual energy here was on a whole different level.

“Ye Qingtian, why are you following me? We’re not from the same direction. Your Indigo Thunder Peak is in that direction!” Xiao Yuanqi turned to coldly look at Ye Qingtian and didn’t bother concealing the disgust on his face. He and the other inner sect disciples had the same expression. After all, Ye Qingtian was a famous piece of trash in the Heavenly Dao Sect, and anyone who was close to him would have their character doubted.

But Xiao Yuanqi had pointed out a direction for Lin Yun.

“Are you dumb? I’m talking to you!” Xiao Yuanqi said unhappily with his brows furrowed.

Returning to his senses, Lin Yun smiled, “Thank you, Senior Brother. I heard Senior Brother returned from the Black Tortoise Void Sea, so I was only curious to see if you had any harvest.”

Lin Yun had calmed down now, and easily found an excuse to deal with Xiao Yuanqi’s question.

“Ha, you really dare to ask. What has Senior Brother Xiao’s harvest got to do with you?”

“Get lost. Stop following us.” The group around Xiao Yuanqi reprimanded him.

Lin Yun was merely calmly looking at Xiao Yuanqi.

Xiao Yuanqi didn’t reply, but said in a playful tone, “Ye Qingtian, I never expected that you would really have the guts to come back.”

All the disciples around him were briefly stunned before they laughed out loud.

“Since sSenior Brother isn’t willing to tell me, I’ll take my leave, then. I’ll pay you a visit another day.” Lin Yun said indifferently.

Seeing how Lin Yun cupped his hands and left made Xiao Yuanqi surprised. He said, “Ye Qingtian, a year might have passed, but you’re no longer the chief disciple of the Indigo Thunder Peak. You’ll suffer if you go back.”

Ye Qingtian used to be the chief disciple of the Indigo Thunder Peak? Lin Yun didn’t stop and continued to head towards the direction of the Indigo Thunder Peak. Along the way, everyone who saw Lin Yun was surprised before they wore disdainful expressions and immediately distanced themselves from him, as though he was a plague.

An hour later, Lin Yun arrived before the Indigo Thunder Peak. The Indigo Thunder Peak was ranked at the bottom amongst the 108 peaks, with three hundred-odd inner disciples. Most inner disciples were at the Profound Life Stage, with those who were younger than thirty-five. Although there were those at the Dragon Pulse Realm, none of them exceeded the age of twenty.

Undoubtedly, those who could make it as inner disciples weren’t weak. The weakest of all 108 peaks already had such a terrifying foundation. When dusk approached, the entrance of the Indigo Thunder Peak was covered in leaves, and several disciples were cultivating on the plaza.

Near them was a stone tablet with ‘Indigo Thunder Peak’ engraved on it, and the three words emitted a powerful sword intent. With a glance, Lin Yun could tell that they must be comprehending the sword intent within those words.

“S… S-Senior Brother Ye…” The disciples were startled when they saw Lin Yun and quickly got on their feet.

“Ye Qingtian has returned!”

“Quick, run!” All of the Indigo Thunder Peak’s disciples quickly ran into the peak, and it didn’t take long for this place to be emptied.

This made Lin Yun’s face change, and he took a step forth to hold onto the last person.

That person nearly fell to the ground upon being stopped by Lin Yun, and he wore an awkward smile, “S-Se… Chief Disciple Ye…”

That person quickly changed his tone when he saw that Lin Yun’s expression didn’t look good. Lin Yun didn’t dwell on that, but asked, “How do I address you?”

That person was startled before he awkwardly looked at Lin Yun and said, “Senior Brother, how can you not remember me when it has just been a year? I’m Chen Feng, and you have guided me in my sword technique.”

His face was awkward when he talked about that. Clearly, Ye Qingtian’s method of ‘guiding’ him must be different. This person was probably bullied by Ye Qingtian a lot in the past.

Looking at Chen Feng for a long time, Lin Yun asked, “Where do I stay? I can’t remember. Lead the way.”

Chen Feng was stumped upon hearing that. After all, it had only been a year, so how could Ye Qingtian possibly forget where he stayed? But he suddenly thought of something, and his face changed, “Senior Brother, don’t make things difficult for me. I can’t do anything about it…”

“Someone occupied it?” Lin Yun asked.

Nodding his head, Chen Feng said, “The courtyard that belonged to you was bestowed to Senior Brother Liu Hao by the Peak Master.”

Lin Yun instantly figured everything out. Liu Hao should be the current chief disciple of the Indigo Thunder Peak. He said, “Alright then. Bring me somewhere I can stay for now.”

“T-This isn’t appropriate…” Chen Feng said with a shaking tone.

“Then I’ll stay with you and guide you at night when there’s time.” Lin Yun replied in a casual tone.

“N-No need. Senior Brother, come with me.” Chen Feng said. He had no choice and could only find a remote courtyard for Lin Yun now.

This courtyard was named the Tower Wave Pavilion. This courtyard was abandoned for a long time, and the spiritual array that was connected to the saint vein was destroyed.

Chen Feng initially thought that Lin Yun would throw his temper, but Lin Yun merely waved his hand for him to leave. Even after Chen Feng left, he felt that it was unreal.

At the same time, Liu Hao flew into a rage within a gloriously decorated courtyard on the Indigo Thunder Peak when he heard of Ye Qingtian’s return. When he threw his temper, it immediately made the faces of the disciples who came to report to him pale. “That piece of garbage still dares to return?! He must be courting death!”

Lin Yun simply tidied up the Tower Wave Pavilion before calling Lil’ Purple out. When Lil’ Purple came out, she chuckled, “That senior brother of yours is too unreliable!”

This gave Lin Yun a headache because Ye Qingtian seemed to be pretty ‘famous’ within the Heavenly Dao Sect. It was to the point that everyone avoided him. Even his junior brothers from the same peak didn’t dare to stay around after seeing him.

This further showed that Ye Qingtian was usually arrogant, but this was a piece of good news for him because he didn’t have to interact with anyone this way. But just what did Ye Qingtian do to be expelled from the Heavenly Dao Sect? He couldn’t ask about it because it would make him seem weird, but he wanted to make it clear, no matter what, because it kept bugging him.

“Perhaps there is a deeper meaning for Senior Brother to be doing this.” Lin Yun changed the topic and asked, “Can you sense the location of the Solar Lunar Divine Rune?”

“There's no need to hurry. Let me see…” Lil’ Purple began to calculate with her fingers, and rings of spiritual runes soon appeared on the ground. As a powerful gale appeared within the pavilion, it lifted Lil’ Purple away from the ground and the spiritual runes briefly rotated before flying out the window.

When Lin Yun and Lil’ Purple approached the window, they saw the spiritual runes flying in a certain direction and soon disappeared. Lin Yun asked, “Can you confirm the location?”

The Heavenly Dao Sect was massive, so they had to verify the location, or it would be hard to find the Sovereign Divine Rune.

Lil’ Purple ignored Lin Yun’s question and smiled, “The Solar Lunar Divine Rune is still here. I wasn’t too confident before. Lin Yun, try and find a map!”

The two looked around the Tower Wave Pavilion and soon found a map of the Heavenly Dao Sect. The Heavenly Dao Sect’s inner sect had two palaces, three courtyards, and a hundred and eight peaks. The two palaces were the Heavenly Yin Palace and Dao Yang Palace.

The three courtyards were the Profound Maiden Courtyard, Nether Orchid Courtyard, and the Holy Spirit Courtyard. The hundred and eight peaks were beneath the two palaces and three courtyards in terms of position.

“Do you know this Nether Orchid Courtyard?” Lil’ Purple asked.

But Lin Yun shook his head because he had just joined the Heavenly Dao Sect.

“Let’s start from this place. I have a feeling that it should be somewhere close by…” Lil’ Purple held onto her chin.

But Lin Yun shook his head and said, “The Solar Lunar Divine Rune is a Sovereign Divine Rune, and it shouldn’t be that easy to find. Most importantly, do you think that the Heavenly Dao Sect doesn’t know about the Solar Lunar Divine Rune? If they know about it, it will be harder for us to obtain it.”

Lil’ Purple fell into deep thoughts before nodding her head, “That makes sense. But let’s try to confirm the location first and see if the Solar Lunar Divine Rune is in the Nether Orchid Courtyard. You can go there tomorrow, and I can verify.”

“Alright, then.” Lin Yun felt that the Nether Orchid Courtyard wasn’t that simple.

Thirty minutes later, Chen Feng, who brought Lin Yun over, nervously returned. He said, “Senior Brother, the Peak Master asked you to go to the Indigo Thunder Hall.”

The Indigo Thunder Hall was equivalent to a main hall of a sect, and, normally, no disciple would be summoned over.

“What’s the matter?” Lin Yun asked.

“Senior Brother returned without saying anything, and the Peak Master is very angry right now. The elders and deacons are all gathered there now.”

“What did the Peak Master say?”

“The Peak Master asked you to go there within half an incense of time or don’t ever come to the Indigo Thunder Peak again.” Chen Feng said fearfully, fearing that Lin Yun might vent his anger at him.

“Let’s go, then.” Lin Yun got up on his feet and looked at Chen Feng. “Lead the way.”

Chen Feng was stunned for a long time before he came to his senses. It appears that Ye Qingtian has changed. Didn’t he know the consequences of angering the Peak Master? But he didn’t dare to stay a word and nervously led the way.

On the other hand, Lin Yun felt helpless because he had already caused such a huge din upon arriving, and he probably wouldn’t have any peace while in the Heavenly Dao Sect.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m
