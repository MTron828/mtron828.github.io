Chapter 262 - Scarlet Sunlight

“I’m the one who will be killing you guys!” A clear voice sounded out like the patter of sprinkling rain. Clearly, the voice was very arrogant, but for some reason, it was comfortable like fluffy clouds.

Gao Yu had just escaped death, so he immediately rejoiced when he heard those words. When he turned around, he saw a young man walking out of the valley carrying a sword box on his back. Naturally, it was Lin Yun, who had been practicing his fist technique with the golden tiger deep in the valley. As soon as Lin Yun achieved some improvement in the Dragon-Tiger Fist, he rushed over before the sky turned dark.

However, he never expected that he would run into such a brutal scene. Half of the team was dead and their corpses were torn into pieces. Fragments of their organs and limbs were lying around.

Aside from Bai Qiushui, the other survivors were kneeling on the ground. Even Bu Chen and Xiao Ran, who were so arrogant earlier, were kneeling. On the other hand, only a few of them remembered their duties. Their mission was to ensure Bai Qiushui’s safety. It was clear that at this moment, the wandering cultivators had impure intentions for Bai Qiushui. Ironically, only the weak Gao Yu remained on his feet.

“Lin Yun!” The Gao Clan’s disciples were shocked that Lin Yun returned. They were the ones that claimed that Lin Yun was a coward who ran away. But not only did Lin Yun return, he even saved Gao Yu.

“How is this possible?!” The various disciples were shocked. They never expected Lin Yun to return.

“Is that guy courting death?!” Xiao Ran also had shock written on his face.

“Hmph. He’s courting death. So what if he comes out? He’ll end up kneeling on the ground like us anyway,” said Bu Chen with darkened eyes. He didn’t think that Lin Yun could fight with them. Xue Feng’s underlings alone were enough to deal with Lin Yun.

The skinny wandering cultivator and the one-eyed wandering cultivator looked at Lin Yun with smiles. They noticed that Lin Yun’s cultivation was only in the third stage of the Profound Martial Realm, but they had no idea where Lin Yun got his confidence.

Just a moment ago, Bu Chen and Xiao Ran acted even more arrogant than Lin Yun. However, they still ended up on their knees begging for mercy.

“Big Brother, what should we do with this brat?” asked the skinny wandering cultivator with a smile.

“Let’s play with him. It’s not like we have anything better to do anyway.” Xue Feng didn’t even look at Lin Yun. His gaze was focused on the valley, which was equivalent to a treasure in his eyes.

If he could control this valley, it would only be a matter of time before he would gather all the wandering cultivators in the Bloodbone Forest. At that time, all the wandering cultivators would be under his command. Just the thought of that possibility made Xue Feng rejoiced inwardly. As for Lin Yun, Xue Feng only considered him to be a piece of garbage like Bu Chen and Xiao Ran. He didn’t place Lin Yun in his eyes sys ll.

“Young Master Lin, these three are Bloodbone Wandering Cultivators, so you should leave while you can.”

“Leave? I’ll take at least half of you down with me. Not to mention that…” Lin Yun comforted Bai Qiushui with his words while calling the Dragon Blooded Horse over. His mission was to protect Bai Qiushui, so he would take her away if he really wanted to leave.

“Old Third, are youngsters so arrogant nowadays? Tsk, tsk. He seems to be looking down on us?” The one-eyed wandering cultivator laughed with a playful gaze.

“You want to escape? None of you will be living here. Kneel!” The skinny wandering cultivator’s face turned cold and he sent the ominous aura that he had accumulated over the years towards Lin Yun.

When his ominous aura gushed out, the Gao Clan’s disciples trembled in fear. They were greatly intimidated by the wandering cultivators’ to begin with, so they couldn’t resist the ominous aura at all.

Lin Yun narrowed his eyes, looking at the ominous aura sweeping over and unleashed his king aura, which stabbed forward like a sharp blade. The king aura instantly tore apart the ominous aura and bolted towards the skinny wandering cultivator. Lin Yun had infused his sword intent in the attacking king aura.

The skinny wandering cultivator’s mind instantly exploded. He felt as though three lord-rank demonic beasts were looking at him coldly. With a trace of shock flickering through his eyes, the skinny wandering cultivator took several steps back. His heart was throbbing right now. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

This scene shocked everyone when they saw how Lin Yun merely used his gaze to scare the skinny wandering cultivator. Retracting his gaze, Lin Yun carried Bai Qiushui and placed her on the Dragon Blooded Horse. With a smile, he said, “Why do I need to escape? Isn’t it better to kill all of them?”

Seven Profound Steps – Seven Punches in One Step.

Lin Yun roared and left behind seven afterimages, with each of them throwing out a punch. Every punch contained his origin energy that was refined with the Iris Sword Sutra and Age Sutra. When his punch reached the one-eyed wandering cultivator, it rumbled like a flash of lightning.

“A small fry in the third stage of the Profound Martial Realm dares to put on an act before me? You’re courting death!” The one-eyed cultivator roared, executing the Flameiron Fist – Hundred Refinery. A fiery aura surged from his body, which made his physique like a forge.

“Second Brother, watch out!” The skinny wandering cultivator called out. But he was too late because the one-eyed wandering cultivator’s attack crumbled. Traces of blood oozed out of his lips as he was blown away.

“Damn it!” Rage burned in the skinny wandering cultivator’s eyes and he charged Lin Yun, not giving the latter any opportunities. His claw tore through the air resistance and pounced at Lin Yun.

He used the Demonic Fiendclaw, the same move that tore many Gao Clan disciples into pieces. However, Lin Yun remained calm and wasn’t affected by the ominous aura. His fist shot out like a sword and origin energy started to ripple within his body. The forty-two petals of the Iris Flower blossomed in his Dantian as his origin energy surged out endlessly.

Right at this moment, the one-eyed wandering cultivator wiped the blood from the corner of his lips and charged over once more.

“Two against one? You’re just in time!” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with a trace of fire as the blood in his body boiled. At the same time, his third stage of the Profound Martial Realm cultivation rippled with signs of making a breakthrough.

He had used three beast cores with king auras to reach the third stage of the Profound Martial Realm. For an ordinary cultivator, any single one of them could help one make a breakthrough. But Lin Yun had actually used all three, which increased his cultivation to the pinnacle third stage.

So how could he not be happy when he suddenly showed signs of making a breakthrough?

“Not enough! It’s not enough! Are Bloodbone Wandering Cultivators really so useless?” Lin Yun’s hands joined together to form the Undying Vajra Seal.

Under the Dragon-Tiger Might, Lin Yun’s aura began to surge. With the Undying Vajra Seal empowering it, Lin Yun’s attack exploded like a volcanic eruption. The drizzling rain fell onto Lin Yun’s face as his fists slammed into the two wandering cultivators. Under the immense pressure, the two wandering cultivators had to use their full strength to withstand the attack.

“This is Lin Yun?” This scene dumbfounded the Gao Clan disciples. Lin Yun was handling the two wandering cultivators by himself. Not only was he not put at a disadvantage, he actually held the advantage when fighting the two wandering cultivators.

“Damn it! How can this be?!” Bu Chen looked at this scene with disbelief. Then again, he wasn’t too bothered since Xue Feng still hadn’t attacked.

But in the next second, Lin Yun’s aura exploded like a volcano. He just made a breakthrough right before everyone’s eyes. Another profound vein formed in his body and his cultivation reached the fourth stage. His aura swept out into the surroundings when this happened.

The faces of the skinny wandering cultivator and the one-eyed wandering cultivator changed. They were having a tough time dealing with Lin Yun when he was in the third stage of the Profound Martial Realm. So when they saw that Lin Yun made a breakthrough, their eyes flashed with a trace of fear. The two immediately turned around to run away.

“Can you guys even escape?” Lin Yun snorted and executed the Dragon-Tiger Steps. His figure seemed like a dragon and tiger while he flickered around. After taking nine steps, his aura rose to an unprecedented height and he caught up to the two wandering cultivators.

With one hand manifesting the dragon and the other manifesting a tiger, Lin Yun threw out his punches. His punches instantly shattered the bones in the bodies of the two wandering cultivators, forcing them to collapse on the ground.

“Stop!” Just when Lin Yun was about to finish them with the Flickering Divine Sword, a cold gleam shot over. The two wandering cultivators took this opportunity to get up on their feet and ran back to Xue Feng. Their faces were drained at the moment.

Was the leader finally going to make his move? Lin Yun kept up his guard when he faced the two wandering cultivators, but Xue Feng was surprisingly patient. He only made his move when his underlings were about to die.

“That’s Xue Feng, ranked 98th on the Great Thief Ranking,” said Bai Qiushui from the Dragon Blooded Horse to give Lin Yun context.

Great Thief Xue Feng? It was a familiar name to Lin Yun. After searching through his memories, he recalled that this person was the target of his third mission.

This mission was initially meant for the top ten on the Mortal Ranking to work together to complete, but it was taken by Lin Yun instead. Lin Yun never expected that he would run into Xue Feng here, but this wasn’t the place for them to fight because Bai Qiushui and the rest were still around.

“Leave with your men. Seven days from now, I will return to the Bloodbone Forest to claim your head,” said Lin Yun. His words sounded like the biggest joke to Bu Chen and Xiao Ran. They never expected that Lin Yun would still be so arrogant even when facing death.

“Interesting… What if I don’t leave?” Xue Feng smiled while holding onto the devil mask.

“Then I’ll be claiming your life with the sword in my hand and the valley will be dyed red. When the sun sets today, Xue Feng will no longer be on the Great Thief Ranking,” said Lin Yun while the scarlet sunlight shined on his face. His voice was calm, but it was filled with cold, brutal killing intent.
