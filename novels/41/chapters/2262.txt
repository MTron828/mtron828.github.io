Chapter 2263 - Silver-Eyed Demonspirit

“Lin Yun?”

“What is that fellow doing here?” The Heavenly Sage Saint Lord, the Crow Shot Saint Lord, and the Indigo Brave Saint Lord were shocked. That was especially the case for the Heavenly Sage Saint Lord. After all, he even tried jumping down the Fallen God Valley when Lin Yun fell, and he nearly lost his life.

As a result, they concluded that even a Saint Sovereign would lose their life in the Fallen God Valley if they jumped down. But Lin Yun was fine and had undergone a drastic transformation in his strength, naturally leaving them dumbfounded.

“How is this possible?”

“How did he manage to do it…?” The Heavenly Sage Saint Lord and Crow Shot Saint Lord’s eyes were wide from the shock.

Everyone else was naturally more shocked that Lin Yun had defeated Gu Xinyu with one sword, and that the Red Lotus Karma Flame couldn’t do anything to him. Most importantly, they knew that Lin Yun had yet to reveal his strength. He didn’t even use his Quasi-Divine Light Sword Intent, his strongest trump card.

After all, Lin Yun used his Quasi-Divine Light Sword Intent to split heaven apart when competing for the Divine Blood Fruit.

Huang Jingyu and Liu Yunlan were stumped after seeing that Lin Yun was still alive.

Ji Zixi excitedly said, “I knew it! I knew that he was still alive! How could he die so easily?!”

Ji Zixi’s eyes were filled with pride. But because of Lin Yun, she was in low spirits for a long time and stayed at the cliffside of the Fallen God Valley for a day, nearly jumping down herself. When she was persuaded to leave, god knows how heartbroken she was feeling. After all, Lin Yun promised that he would go to the Divine Phoenix Mountain, but she suddenly received the news of his death.

Furthermore, he didn’t come to find her even after coming to the Heavenly Void. The more she thought about it, the more furious she became.

When everyone came to their senses, cultivators from the Eastern Desolation became emotional. Who said that there was no one from the holy lands? Flower Burial Lin Yun was a genius from a holy land!

Standing on the Flame Dragon’s skull, Zhao Tianyu and the Ying River King’s faces changed as they looked at Lin Yun with malice.

“Let me face you!” The youth beside the Ying River King’s eyes flashed with chill as he charged at Lin Yun. Before he got close, he pushed his palm forth with his constellation opening up and his saint energy going rampant, releasing the aura of a third-stage Saint Lord.

When his palm descended, a terrifying demonic flame overwhelmed Lin Yun. This was the demonspirit flame that even a saint physique would have a tough time enduring.

As the flame descended, Lin Yun’s sword was so fast that it opened a passage. The flame continued to burn, leaving a few holes in the air. At the same time, the ground had melted into black magma, which looked terrifying.

“What a powerful sword intent!” The Demonspirit Clan’s Saint Lord was surprised with fear lingering in his eyes when he sensed Lin Yun’s sword intent. After all, Lin Yun’s sword could threaten him even without using the Quasi-Divine Light Sword Intent.

He no longer held back. A vertical eye then appeared on his forehead. When he activated his bloodline, he gave off the feeling of an ancient beast that had been awakened as a dazzling silver light shone from the eye on his forehead, causing the entire Flame Dragon Valley to tremble.

“A Silver-Eyed Demonspirit!”

“He’s a Silver-Eyed Demonspirit! Who the hell is he?!”

“This person is a Silver-Eyed Demonspirit and a third-stage Saint Lord. He’s probably invincible against those of the same cultivation.” The Demonspirit Clan was terrifying, to begin with. They were the cause of the Dark Era. Silver-Eyed Demonspirits were the elites within the Demonspirit Clan. Hence, the Kunlun Realm’s cultivators tended to be afraid of them.

When the vertical eye opened up, the aura of the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit became even more terrifying.

But Lin Yun was fearless as he wore a smile. It had been long since he fought a Demonspirit.

Sensing Lin Yun’s gaze, the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit snorted and a black demonic flame ignited in his right hand. His arm then became as tough as metal, with his nails looking like sharp claws. When he reached out, cracks appeared in the air that swiftly spread out.

With a gentle flick of his wrist, Lin Yun dashed forth with the Flower Burial Sword, clashing with the Demonspirit. The Demonspirit took three steps back before regaining his footing, while Lin Yun remained where he was.

“The Silver-Eyed Demonspirit doesn’t seem so impressive after all,” Lin Yun said with a smile.

“You’re courting death!” The Silver-Eyed Demonspirit felt provoked as he charged at Lin Yun, exchanging over ten moves in the blink of an eye. Lin Yun stayed where he was and swung the Flower Burial Sword, withstanding all the incoming attacks. He was like a river that was surging with endless power. Even if the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit’s saint energy was powerful, it couldn’t cross the river.

As his sword ray expanded, Lin Yun began to brew his attack before executing the Divine Firefly Sword. With a dazzling sword ray, the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit was sent flying away.

Everyone was left dumbfounded. This was beyond their expectations. After all, Lin Yun was only a Quasi-Saint!

“How the hell is he so strong?”

“Is he really a Quasi-Saint?”

“Even a third-stage Saint Lord Silver-Eyed Demonspirit can’t do anything to him…” Even the Saint Elders of the Eastern Desolation’s holy lands had to admit that Lin Yun was a little too powerful.

With another swing of his sword, surging waves resounded in the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit’s ears as he became enveloped in sword intent. This sword looked ordinary but left a terrifying wound on the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit’s chest.

“ARGGGH!” The Silver-Eyed Demonspirit screamed out in pain as he spread his arms apart with his flesh wriggling. A terrifying black demonic light soon appeared on his body before he swelled up, completely transforming into a Demonspirit.

After transforming, the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit’s body was as tough as metal. When the Flower Burial Sword fell on his body, it only caused sparks to fly around.

“This is the first time I've seen this. Is this the unique body-refining technique of the Demonspirit Clan?” Lin Yun asked.

“It’s more than enough to kill you!” The Silver-Eyed Demonspirit was furious, with a terrifying killing intent brewing in his eyes.

“I’m afraid not. After all, I’m using the Flower Burial Sword!” Lin Yun circulated his saint energy and activated the four glory spirits in the sword, releasing a vibrating sound that sent the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit flying away. But that wasn’t all. The Flower Burial Sword then aimed at the latter’s forehead, scaring the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit into turning away.

Lin Yun stepped in the air like a fully stretched bow, instantly appearing behind the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit. He turned around and swung his sword, decapitating the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit.

The Silver-Eyed Demonspirit’s decapitated head screamed out with fear, “Ying River King, save me!”

He didn’t want to die to a bitch from the Kunlun Realm. After all, he was a noble Silver-Eyed Demonspirit.

At the critical moment, the Ying River King moved and reached out, retrieving the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit’s head. He coldly looked at Lin Yun, “How dare you!”

When his murderous intent spread out, many Saint Lords in the surroundings were frozen by the chill that was released by him.

“Retreat! That’s a Sovereign Dao!”Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“He’s not a pushover!” Many cultivators panicked as they retreated further away, leaving behind ten-odd cultivators who became ice statues from the intimidation.

“You better not underestimate my courage. Since I’ve swung my sword, why would I allow him to return alive?” Lin Yun smiled as he sheathed his sword. When he sheathed his sword, the frozen cultivators all heaved a sigh in relief after the ice that was encasing them shattered.

“Thank you, Flower Burial!” They were filled with lingering fear and thanked Lin Yun before soaring to the sky as they looked at the Ying River King with shock.

The Silver-Eyed Demonspirit might be the Ying River King’s subordinate, but he knew how strong this subordinate was. The Ying River King wanted to flare up, but he suddenly sensed something wasn’t right and lowered his head. There was a crack on the head in his hand with four sword rays gushing out.

The head blew up in his hand and splattered over his face, leaving the Ying River King dumbfounded. A scream also came from the silver eye on the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit’s forehead as he died.

Everyone took a deep breath and had become scared after seeing this scene. The Demonspirit Clan was powerful because they weren’t easy to kill. Even if their physique was destroyed, they could recover as long as their eye still existed. But they had just witnessed how Lin Yun easily slew a Silver-Eyed Demonspirit.

“Is this a swordsman?” Everyone was shocked as they looked at Lin Yun with respect.

The Ying River King wiped the blood off his face and became eerie, giving off a terrifying chill.

“Let’s back away first…” Several elders from the Ming Cult could feel that something wasn’t right so they retreated with Huang Jingyu. Their instincts told them that the Ying River King wasn’t a pushover.

“It has been long since I met such an arrogant cultivator,” the Ying River King smiled.

Lin Yun smiled, “It’s not too late for you to see one now so that you don’t have any regrets even after you die.”

The Eastern Desolation’s cultivators were shocked by what Lin Yun said because it was too arrogant. The Ying River King had grasped a Sovereign Dao and had lost a Silver-Eyed Demonspirit who was his subordinate. But Lin Yun wasn’t afraid and was still as arrogant as before.
