Chapter 790 - Seizing Every Minute

Seven days was neither long nor short. For Lin Yun, seven days was enough for him to reflect on his fights. After everyone dispersed, Lin Yun wound up in an isolated courtyard in the city. His temporary residence had a massive underground field, a secluded chamber, and all sorts of puppets to train with.

This luxurious courtyard cost Lin Yun 200 fourth grade spiritual jades. However, it was worth the price since he could prepare for the upcoming battle. The courtyard also contained an underground fifth grade spiritual lake with a stage made of ice at its center. The stage was engraved with spiritual arrays that would gather spiritual energy. A stage of this level could only be found at an overlord force, and only a few core disciples were qualified to use them.

Lin Yun climbed the stage and sensed the dense spiritual energy. “Not bad. This place is suitable for seclusion. I should make a breakthrough in my cultivation first.”

Lin Yun was already at the limit of his cultivation and he didn’t need to accumulate his energy any longer. The only reason why he waited so long was so that he could touch the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm.

Lin Yun consolidated a lot of energy during the first and second round, especially since he fought with Ji Feng. So, reaching the pinnacle Yin-Yang stage shouldn’t be difficult as long as he had enough resources. After all, the spiritual lake alone wasn’t enough.

However, Lin Yun didn’t lack resources. He had obtained 100,000 fourth grade spiritual jades back in the Withernorth Sea. That amount was enough to rival a quasi-overlord force.

Lin Yun gently tapped his interspatial pouch and thousands of fourth jade spiritual jades piled onto the stage. With this many spiritual jades, the density of spiritual energy was unbelievably massive.

When Lin Yun sat down, an Iris Flower appeared beneath him. As the flower circulated, boundless spiritual energy poured into Lin Yun’s body. Additionally, the dragon runes on the surface of his body began to squirm. Lin Yun’s goal was to push himself as far as possible, so this process was a little dangerous even though it should happen smoothly.

The liquid origin energy began to circulate and course through his body, filling up his meridians. His origin energy was simply terrifying. Even though his cultivation couldn’t compare to the seven elites, he could rely on the Iris Sword Sutra since it was from the golden age.

From a certain perspective, it was more important than his sword intent. After all, cultivation technique was the foundation of one’s strength. Even without his sword intent, he could still rely on other techniques. But without the Iris Sword Sutra, he would have no foundation.

Endless spiritual energy poured into his body that made him feel like he was burning up. The amount of spiritual energy needed to reach the pinnacle Yin-Yang stage was too domineering. The cold jade stage was supposed to help, but it couldn’t control the chaotic energy in his body.

The dragon runes on the surface of his body began to squirm and release dazzling purple lightning. The ancient azure dragon energy coursed through his body quickly. Then, the dragon runes wrapped around Lin Yun like a sinister dragon to suppress the violent origin energy inside his body.

As time passed, the spiritual energy pouring into Lin Yun’s body was refined into his violet palace. The energy emitted from his violet palace became increasingly powerful, while the Iris Flower trembled violently. Additionally, the hum of a sword could be heard inside Lin Yun’s body.

Lin Yun wasn’t the only person making use of his time. While he attempted a breakthrough, the other geniuses trained hard. In the Indigomoon Elysium’s courtyard, Yu Haotian sparred with a Heavenly Soul Realm elder. He emitted a purple glow that made his physique look like a purple jade.

A massive phenomenon like a boundless ocean would appear everytime he moved. Occasionally, an unbelievably massive purple moon would rise over the ocean’s horizon. It empowered Yu Haotian to the level where it seemed like he could split a mountain apart with his bare hands.

The Heavenly Soul Realm elder fighting him was in a tough spot, evidenced by the cold sweat dripping from his forehead. As for Yu Haotian, he wasn’t even using his full strength.

After ten moves, the Heavenly Soul Realm elder was surprised to find that Yu Haotian’s cultivation technique was extremely peculiar. The elder’s origin energy was actually being devoured by Yu Haotian. As more time passed, he discovered that his origin energy was gradually flying away. The speed wasn’t fast, but he was losing control of it as they fought.

With another clash, the elder was sent flying. With a pale face, he sighed, “The Indigomoon Sutra is truly terrifying. The sect master asked me to train with you, but it turns out that he underestimated you. Your Indigomoon Sutra must’ve reached the twelfth stage, right? I heard that upon reaching the twelfth stage, you can even devour your opponent’s vitality.”

Yu Haotian smiled, “Devouring vitality and origin energy are unorthodox. The true strength of the Indigomoon Sutra is more than that.”

“Perhaps. But with the devouring nature, even Heavenly Soul Realm experts can’t deal with you. You’re practically invincible among those below the Heavenly Soul Realm. It’s certain that you’ll obtain first place in the Draconic Banquet,” replied the elder. He had a premonition that Yu Haotian still had a few trump cards. In a life and death fight, he knew that he wouldn’t even be able to escape from Yu Haotian.

“There will be some adversity, but I’m still going to be first,” said Yu Haotian confidently.

In the Violet Thunder Sect’s courtyard, Zhao Wuji was sparring with the sect master. In just a blink of an eye, the two had exchanged over a hundred moves. However, Zhao Wuji wasn’t being pushed backwards and managed to face the sect master evenly.

The elders watching from the sideline were in disbelief. Although the sect master suppressed his cultivation to Zhao Wuji’s level, this was still unbelievable. After all, the sect master was a seventh soul Heavenly Soul Realm expert with unfathomable cultivation. If it was someone else in Zhao Wuji’s position, they would be easily squashed after three moves.

When the two stopped, the sect master smiled, “Not bad. It looks like you haven’t been slacking over the last few years. I feel like you didn’t give it your all. If you gave this your all, you might even be able to suppress me. Can you tell me what your trump card is?”

The elders were shocked when they heard this. After all, it felt unbelievable to them since the sect master was an untouchable existence.

“You guys will see in the final battle. But aside from Yu Haotian, no one will be able to force out my trump card,” said Zhao Wuji, and everyone could feel the refined aura from Zhao Wuji.

Yan Long’zi was also training. But unlike Zhao Wuji and Yu Haotian, he was sparring with ten quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm experts. He was shirtless in the fight and his muscles were incredibly robust like a ferocious beast. His skin also flickered with red luster, which made his body look like it was crafted from metal.

In reality, his physique was even stronger than metal or a high grade cosmic artifact. When the weapons landed on his body, they would only create sparks. Nothing was able to injure him.

“Too weak.” Yan Long’zi roared and all ten weapons were snapped in two. Taking advantage of the dumbfounded experts, Yan Long’zi laughed sinisterly, “Hehe.”

Clenching his fist, Yan Long’zi threw out punches that exploded with the might of a volcano. When he stopped, the ten quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm experts fainted. Very quickly, the Heavenly Demon Pavilion’s men dragged the ten experts away. If they ignored the ten of them, they would die.

“Lin Yun! I’m going to slaughter you in the ranking battle!” Yan Long’zi could feel his anger explode when he recalled Yue Weiwei humiliating him in public. He threw one more punch that distorted the air while flames surged around it like magma.

“Hmph!” Yan Long’zi snorted before his anger slowly receded.

In the other courtyards, the seven elites were also taking this time to train themselves. The reason why they could stand at the top of the pyramid wasn’t only because of their superb talent and opportunities, but because they were hardworking. Behind their glory was sweat, pain, and loneliness. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

They were confident that no one could affect their position in the top ten. However, they were too ambitious to remain as the seven elites.

After three days passed, Lin Yun finished consuming 7,000 fourth grade spiritual jades. The huge pile of spiritual jades had decreased in height by half a foot. Although the progress seemed smooth, no one could imagine the pain Lin Yun was undergoing.

Suddenly, a huge sound rumbled and the pile of fourth grade spiritual jades was reduced to dust. This meant that Lin Yun had finished his breakthrough after three days.
