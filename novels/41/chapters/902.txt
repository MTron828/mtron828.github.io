Chapter 903 - Wine Cellar

No matter how desperate Chen Qiong and Xian Yunzhen felt, Lin Yun couldn’t be bothered with them. He was already on the third level, which was the last level of the pavilion. Perhaps the Hidden Treasure Pavilion was tall in ancient times, but it was only three levels tall now.

He was currently looking at all of the holes in the broken roof. The third level was a wine cellar with an intoxicating wine aroma. Lin Yun felt light as if his soul would leave his body. Meanwhile, Lil’ Red’s eyes were shut as it wore an intoxicating expression.

“What dense wine aroma,” sighed Lin Yun after recovering from his shock. The wine that he smelled was a lot better than the Monkey Wine he obtained in the past. The aroma was so tempting that he wanted to get drunk and never sober up.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

If Drifting Goblet was here, he would surely be happy to see all of the wine. The third hall was larger than the first and second hall, so Lin Yun saw many kinds of wine pots. He saw pots made of metal, wood, bone, porcelain, and crystal.

He could sense that the wine pots were sealed by a transparent crystal wall. Without hesitation, Lil’ Red charged over and threw a punch at the wall. However, it was knocked backwards and only left several cracks on the crystal wall. The crystal walls might have lasted for a long time, but they still had a restriction on them.

At the center of the wine cellar was a pool of wine forged with ice. He had no idea what kind of ice was used, but it looked glossy and emitted a celestial aura. The aura sent chills down his back.

Suddenly, Lin Yun heard a cracking sound as he turned around to see Lil’ Red tearing the crystal wall apart with a dagger. Lil’ Red charged into the hole in the wall and started drinking the wine.

Lin Yun smiled before he walked towards the wine cellar too. As he got closer, the chilling aura made him tremble. The chilling aura was so strong that he felt it deep inside his bones.

At this moment, Lin Yun could feel his entire world spiralling as he started to stagger. When he was ten meters away from the pool of wine, Lin Yun fell onto one knee. When he raised his head, his eyes were blurred and watery as if he was bewitched. If a woman were to see him, they would surely be captivated by his gaze.

“I might have to crawl if this goes on. Just what kind of wine is in this pool?” Lin Yun’s face changed drastically as he started to release his spiritual sword intent. His gaze gradually cleared up as he expelled the wine aroma from his body.

His movements were slow and he didn’t dare to be careless. In the past, he would only be in this state when facing the pressure of experts. This was the first time he was forced into this state by wine aroma.

“What great wine!” Lin Yun got back on his feet and took a deep breath.

“I’m really curious to see what’s hidden in the wine cellar.” Lin Yun squinted his eyes as he pushed his spiritual sword intent to the limit and headed towards the pool of wine. When he got close, Lin Yun could sense that even the dragon runes on his body were frozen.

Gathering himself, Lin Yun waved his hand and the chilling aura emitted from the wine cellar dissipated. As the mist dissipated, a golden flame appeared in the pool of wine that looked like a gorgeous painting.

When the mist disappeared, the golden flame that was hidden deep in the pool looked like a bright sun. Despite getting close he still felt like the flame was far away.

As he began to feel confused, the golden flames in the pool started to circulate before blooming like a flower. In the next second, the flames pounced towards Lin Yun like a legendary golden crow.

“Holy shit!” Lin Yun’s face changed because the rhythm from the golden crow was so perfect that it immobilized him. Even his sword intent was completely sealed. Before Lin Yun could even think, the golden crow had enveloped his entire body. When he opened his eyes, he smiled bitterly and saw that the pool of wine was slightly smaller.

The flames were no longer seen at the bottom of the pool. Instead, he saw a wine pot and a purple wine cup. The pot had an elegant aura and the purple cup looked dreamy.

“So that’s the reason,” muttered Lin Yun as he retrieved the pot and cup. When he looked at the Azure Dragon engraved on the wine pot, he fell into deep thoughts. I think I saw a dragon image at the bottom of the wine pot…

Is this wine from the dragon clan? Can these be the legendary divine dragon wine? Divine dragon wine didn’t refer to a specific wine, but the wine that was brewed by the dragon clan. Only noble guests were worthy of the famous divine dragon wine.

“There seems to be something different about this wine pot…” Lin Yun slowly turned the wine pot around and saw an ancient engraving at the bottom that had the word ‘Mo’.

Mo clan? Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts while Lil’ Red whimpered. When Lin Yun turned his gaze over, he couldn’t help smiling. Lil’ Red drank too much wine that it got itself stuck in a shelf. Fortunately, Lil’ Red had thick skin or else it would be covered with wounds right now.

Seeing that Lil’ Red couldn’t get out anytime soon, Lin Yun flicked his finger and destroyed a portion of the shelf to help Lil’ Red out. When it raised its head, it was confused as it clearly had no idea what just happened.

“This fool…” Lin Yun smiled and left Lil’ Red by the side.
