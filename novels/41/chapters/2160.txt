Chapter 2161 - Heavenly Dao Fist

Gu Xiyan began to hallucinate. In his eyes, when Ye Qingtian held onto the Flower Burial Sword and charged at him, he seemed to have become Flower Burial at this moment. This made him briefly stunned, and he wasn’t able to react in time.

When he came to his senses, Gu Xiyan felt that his life was being threatened since the sword was aimed at his forehead, and it couldn’t be dodged. A moment could change the outcome of a battle among geniuses, and one would lose the opportunity to dodge the sword if they were distracted just for a moment.

A ruthless light flashed across Gu Xiyan’s eyes. Since he couldn’t avoid this attack, he might as well not dodge it. As an indigo radiance shone from his body, Gu Xiyan roared, “Qilin Body!”

Gu Xiyan’s body began to swell under the indigo radiance that swept out from his body. His body began to swell under the indigo radiance with indigo scales appearing on his skin, emitting a metallic luster. His body was like divine iron, giving off a horrifying aura with purple runes spreading on his body.

When Lin Yun’s sword reached Gu Xiyan’s forehead, it was stopped by an invisible energy. Under the huge impact, lightning flashed and the Flower Burial Sword was knocked away.

“The Qilin Body… isn’t Gu Xiyan’s saint physique a little too terrifying?” Everyone was shocked when they saw this outside the Dragon Mountain. They initially thought that Ye Qingtian could turn the tables around, and the battle would come to an end. But who could have imagined that Gu Xiyan’s Qilin Saint Physique could manifest a Qilin. Gu Xiyan definitely refined some Qilin blood because his scales were too realistic.

At this moment, Gu Xiyan looked as though he had turned into a genuine Qilin, giving off a horrifying aura.

“I’ll play with you since you want to play. But you better be serious or you might really die…” Gu Xiyan looked prideful as he looked at Lin Yun, and the indigo radiance shining on his face gave him an eerie temperament.

“Ha!” Looking at Gu Xiyan. whose body had swelled, Lin Yun no longer suppressed the boiling Dragon’s Blood within his body. As thunderstorms roared, a terrifying dragon’s roar echoed with lightning flashing within Lin Yun’s eyes, accompanied by a massive dragon aura that swept out.

The Divine Physique was the taboo of this world. After all, the Azure Dragon Divine Physique was equivalent to grasping part of the Ancient Azure Dragon’s power. The surrounding space was heavily suppressed with Lin Yun in the center, and a visible indigo aura swept out, enveloping the entire Heavenly Dragon Stage.

The violent gale had formed into multiple vortexes around Lin Yun. Fluctuations began to spread out around the vortexes before forming into countless cracks. Lightning flashed on Lin Yun’s body as he soared to the sky and a massive downpour rained from the sky. As lightning began to flash on Lin Yun’s body, he released the Azure Dragon Divine Physique, unleashing a horrifying phenomenon.

Lin Yun’s body also began to swell up with dragon scales appearing on the surface of his body. As scales swiftly spread out, it gave Lin Yun an explosive power that made him feel like he could easily tear mountains apart with his hands.

Compared to Gu Xiyan, Lin Yun’s divine physique gave off a more powerful pressure. As a terrifying luster filled Lin Yun’s eyes, he grinned, “I initially wanted to play with you using an ordinary saint physique, only to receive your contempt. Since that’s the case, I won’t act anymore. Mine isn’t the Azure Dragon Saint Physique, but the Azure Dragon Divine Physique!”Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Then I will slay a dragon!” Gu Xiyan was surprised because he could sense that Lin Yun’s aura was much stronger than before.

“A decent mindset, but it’s a pity…” Lin Yun looked at Gu Xiyan and stomped his foot on the ground. His body disappeared and reappeared before Gu Xiyan like he had teleported, before he threw his punch. Since Gu Xiyan liked to use his fist, he would play along with the latter then.

When he threw his punch, the air in front of him was compressed and exploded, causing space to distort. But Gu Xiyan was calm and didn’t dodge the attack, and he even showed a hint of contempt in his eyes. He also threw a punch forth to face Lin Yun’s punch head-on.

When the two punches collided, a loud explosion echoed with the surrounding space shattered. Gu Xiyan took two steps back with a smile on his face before he dashed forth. The divine physique might be powerful, but Ye Qingtian was simply courting death to fight him barehanded as a swordsman.

Lin Yun was calm and composed with no intentions of recalling the Flower Burial Sword. Instead, he faced Gu Xiyan head-on barehandedly.

“Come again!” Fighting spirits blazed in Gu Xiyan’s eyes. It had been a long time since he had such a satisfying battle. He had been holding himself back whenever he fought those in the same generation because he couldn’t unleash his full strength. After all, he might kill his opponent if he used his full strength, but he could have a satisfying battle now.

When two gigantic figures clashed, a terrifying shockwave swept out. This scene made everyone on the Dragon Mountain feel their scalps numb, and their hearts nearly exploded. They couldn’t imagine how strong they were to create such a huge commotion when fighting barehanded.

“Isn’t Ye Qingtian a little too arrogant? A swordsman like him actually managed to obtain a divine physique?!” Many cultivators outside the Dragon Mountain wore grave expressions because they knew how terrifying a divine physique was, even if it was acquired later on.

The Heavenly Dao Sect’s Thousand Plume Great Saint also wore a grave expression with unconcealable shock in his eyes. He couldn’t believe that Ye Qingtian really managed to obtain a divine physique under the Dragon Origin Great Saint’s teachings. But it wouldn’t be easy for Ye Qingtian to win this battle because a swordsman was ultimately a swordsman. Without his sword, it was hard for Ye Qingtian to defeat Gu Xiyan.

He already noticed that Gu Xiyan had executed a fist technique, the legendary Heavenly Dao Fist. If those without a strong fate tried to practice it, they would be courting death.

After another clash, Gu Xiyan’s punch landed on Lin Yun’s right shoulder and thunderflames began to corrode Lin Yun’s saint aura. When an explosion took place, cracks appeared on Lin Yun’s right shoulder bone.

After Lin Yun was sent flying away, he whipped a kick like a dragon’s tail and landed on Gu Xiyan’s chest. When his attack reached, blood splashed with the indigo radiance shattering.

Lin Yun turned around and hovered in the air. He had blood stains on his body and many of his dragon scales had shattered. But Gu Xiyan’s condition wasn’t any better than him. They were both pretty heavily injured in their intense fight.

Many cultivators outside the Dragon Mountain were deeply shocked as they watched the fight. This was a battle between two cultivators who possessed top-tiered physiques. If it was someone else taking their attacks, they would probably be ripped into pieces on the spot.

Gu Xiyan wiped the blood off his lips and his eyes became crimson, filled with an ominous aura. When he raised his head to look at Ye Qingtian, the contempt had been reduced, replaced with a hint of admiration and respect. He said, “To be able to force me this far after your sword technique failed, you’re not simple, Ye Qingtian!”

It had been a long time since he had such a satisfying battle, especially since Ye Qingtian chose to clash barehanded instead of using his sword.

Lin Yun took a deep breath and the Dragon’s Blood within his body began to boil to resolve the thunderflame that Gu Xiyan had left within his body. Gu Xiyan was a ruthless person. Lin Yun wasn’t able to suppress him even after bringing out his Azure Dragon Divine Physique.

“But it’s annoying when you pretend to be Flower Burial. Let’s end the battle quickly.” Gu Xiyan didn’t want to drag the battle any longer because he was surprised to discover that the recovery speed of Lin Yun’s divine physique was stronger than his own.

In the next moment, terrifying lightning began to sweep out, instantly filling the entire region with the qilin aura, accompanied with murderous intent that began to accumulate in the heavens and earth, slowly fusing with heavenly dao.

The surrounding atmosphere suddenly became suffocating as the qilin aura seemed to be undergoing a transformation. As lightning flashed in Gu Xiyan’s eyes, he looked like a God of Thunder at this moment with him basking in lightning.

“This is my final trump card. If you can withstand it, I’ll give up on the Heavenly Dragon Lord’s title,” Gu Xiyan grinned, and he roared, “Kill!”

An ancient ‘kill’ word appeared in the sky that descended. When the word enveloped the Heavenly Dragon Stage, it had isolated the stage from the outside world.

“Dragon Trapping Heavenly Dao!” Gu Xiyan clenched his fist, releasing a black radiance as his murderous intent began to accumulate in his fist. It sounded as if there was an entire army yelling ‘kill’ in unison as Gu Xiyan’s punch gathered the murderous intent of thousands of people. When Gu Xiyan threw his punch out, he unleashed a powerful punch of over a hundred feet that swiftly flew towards Lin Yun.

Seeing this punch, Lin Yun’s face became grave because he could sense that he was being isolated from the outside world and that the pressure given off by his divine aura was entirely suppressed. Gu Xiyan’s punch was weird because aside from containing murderous intent, it made his heart beat wildly with his soul trembling.

As Lin Yun’s thoughts processed, he began to form seals with his hands. When he formed the seven divine dragon seals, a seven-colored radiance shone as the Sovereign Dragon Seal was formed and blocked the incoming punch.

When Gu Xiyan’s punch landed on the Sovereign Dragon Seal, the seal shattered with a crack before Lin Yun was sent flying away with blood dripping down his lips. He was surprised because the power contained within Gu Xiyan’s punch seemed to be above the three thousand daos, giving him a feeling that there was no way he could face it head-on. He exclaimed, “Heavenly dao?”

“Not heavenly dao, but mimicking heavenly dao with qilin aura. Even so, it’s more than enough to deal with you, and this is just the beginning!” Gu Xiyan smiled because Ye Qingtian finally suffered a loss, so he threw another punch forth.

His murderous intent swept out with his punch forming into multiple ferocious Thunder Qilin. Not only did Gu Xiyan’s indigo saint aura contain qilin aura, but it was also empowered by two greater daos with a hint of a heavenly dao’s might.

This terrifying scene left many Saint Realm experts shocked because Gu Xiyan was a little too strong to mimic a heavenly dao’s might through qilin aura.

“Qilin’s Rage!” Gu Xiyan’s hands joined together and a few hundred qilin descended from the sky so quickly that it made it impossible to dodge the incoming attacks.
