Chapter 2305 - Capable Of Accepting A Loss

“This is just the beginning!” Lin Yun smiled as he charged again with the Flower Burial Sword. He was still executing the Carefree 9 Swords, but the ‘Heaven’ and ‘Earth’ words had perfectly fused this time.

In the past, Lin Yun relied on this move to defeat all his opponents and had never failed if his opponent couldn’t forcibly tear apart his sword aura using their cultivation.

But the holy master smiled as his hands began to move, each drawing a circle in the air. As flames surged from the surroundings, the holy master’s hands moved even faster and the circles increased in number.

Lin Yun’s sword techniques were breathtaking without flaws, but the rings were endless and reappeared whenever they were destroyed. No matter how Lin Yun attacked, he couldn’t break apart the holy master’s defenses.

“Wind! Fire! Lightning! Ice!” Lin Yun retreated as he swung four swords mid-air, each forming into an ancient word that contained a terrifying power. The intent contained in his swords also differed.

The holy master clasped his hands together and countless flames converged to form a flaming pillar, destroying the four attacks without stepping back.

“Ninth sword form, Kill!” Lin Yun turned around as he unleashed a terrifying murderous intent. Cracks appeared in the sky as a ‘Kill’ word descended from the sky.

“Not bad!” The holy master wore a grave expression but didn’t panic. When the ‘Kill’ word began to descend, Lin Yun spread his hands apart with his left sleeve flying out.

Scarlet flames scattered in the air with boundless lifeforce spreading out, causing the grass on the ground to grow. When Lin Yun’s murderous intent descended, it began to melt like snow.

“That didn't work?” Lin Yun widened his eyes with disbelief.

“Flower Burial, are you done with the Carefree 9 Swords? It’s my turn now.” The holy master smiled, looking at Lin Yun.

Lin Yun heard what the holy master said when he wanted to bring out his Sword Domain. He said, “Go ahead.”

“Okay!” The holy master reached out with his right hand and a phoenix cry echoed, accompanied by a sword vibration before a saint sword flew over. When the holy master grabbed onto the saint sword, his temperament greatly changed.

“The name of this sword is Wind Chime, and it has been a long time since I made a move. Observe well, as this is my first Listening Wind Chime!”

The holy master swung his sword with an unimaginable speed. The sword didn’t only contain Flame Dao, which he was proficient with, but also contained a boundless gale. Before the sword ray arrived, Lin Yun was forced to take two steps back from the wind with his eyes closed.

When Lin Yun’s sight recovered, the sword ray had already reached him, and he shattered it with his Flower Burial Sword without a second thought. But when the sword ray was destroyed, it turned into a white tiger and azure dragon, biting Lin Yun’s left and right shoulders.

As blood gushed out from Lin Yun’s shoulders, he felt helpless, with his face drastically changing. Lin Yun’s lips moved with great difficulty, but he still raised his head and said, “I lost.”

“Oh?” The holy master was surprised. “Not exactly. You didn’t bring out your Sword Domain and Sovereign Constellation; you also have a sword technique you didn’t use. So let us continue after a brief rest.”

Lin Yun smiled and said, “I am not someone who can’t accept my loss. I do have trump cards, but don’t you as well? I don’t wish to say it, but I have lost… I have underestimated everyone in the world and the Divine Phoenix Mountain.”

The holy master still wanted to persuade Lin Yun, but Lin Yun raised his head and smiled, “I lost today, but not tomorrow. I still have my Sword Domain and will break your sword tomorrow. Can I come again tomorrow?”

The holy master was briefly stunned before he laughed, “Sure. You’re welcome anytime. It looks like I have underestimated you.”

“I’ll take my leave now.” Lin Yun decisively turned around and left.

Looking at Lin Yun’s back figure, the holy master smiled, “I’m still not satisfied yet…”

Two figures descended. They were the Last Sky Great Saint and Astral River Saint Sovereign.

“Holy Master, what do you think?” The Astral River Saint Sovereign asked.

The holy master looked in the direction that Lin Yun left. He could no longer see Lin Yun, but his gaze didn’t change. He smiled, “A hero of this generation.”

“Didn’t he lose? So why do you have such a high evaluation of him?” The Last Sky Great Saint asked.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Yeah, he only managed to withstand a sword,” the Astral River Saint Sovereign was also baffled.

The holy master smiled, “You guys won’t understand. It’s not frightening to lose. I’m relieved since he can admit his defeat. This way, Xi’er won’t die so easily if she follows him…”

“I see…” The Astral River Saint Sovereign fell into deep thoughts.

The holy master continued, “I like him. Astral River Saint Sovereign!”

“Here!” The Astral River Saint Sovereign didn’t dare to neglect to see that the holy master had instructions to give.

“Go see him tomorrow and give him some divine dragon saint liquid, ten Phoenix Blood Fruit, ten Phoenix Blood Pellets, and a hundred Saint Crystals, and you can pick some thousand-year-old spiritual fruit as snacks for him,” the holy master said.

The Astral River Saint Sovereign widened his mouth with disbelief because that was really generous. The others were treasures, but the holy master said to give Lin Yun some thousand-year-old spiritual fruits as snacks.

“Roger that,” the Astral River Saint Sovereign said.

“Every day. Prepare it for him until the Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign comes. You’re only allowed to give him more and not less,” the holy master smiled, leaving behind the dumbfounded Last Sky Great Saint and Astral River Saint Sovereign.

“Last Sky Great Saint, what does the master mean by that? Is he really going to take Lin Yun in as his son-in-law?” The Astral River Saint Sovereign asked, looking at the Last Sky Great Saint.

The Last Sky Great Saint said, “Son-in-law? Even his biological son didn’t receive such treatment. You ask me, but who am I going to ask?”

When Lin Yun returned to the Stream Cloud Residence, Lil’ Purple came out of the Iris Secret Realm. She muttered, “Why are you so honest to carry on fighting him when you have so many trump cards?”

Lin Yun laid on the chair and said, “It’s not that I don’t want to, but he held back on that sword. If he was more ruthless, my hands would’ve been severed by now.”

“That serious?” Lil’ Purple was shocked.

“What do you think?” Lin Yun replied.

“You don’t have to talk about ethics with him and use whatever schemes you have,” Lil’ Purple said furiously.

She teased Lin Yun, and he said, “Let’s not talk about him. Is what he said true? That you’re the Heavenly Slaughter Empress?”

“I am the Heavenly Slaughter Empress right from the beginning. Since when have I bragged before? It’s just that you didn’t believe me,” Lil’ Purple said firmly.

“Cut it out. You have boasted a lot.” Lin Yun’s eyes lit up, before he continued, “Since that’s the case, why don’t you just disclose your identity to them?”

Lil’ Purple’s gaze became dim, before she sighed, “I found this place familiar when we came here and recovered some of my memories. What he said is right. The Ji Clan should have been my followers in the past.”

“Why don't you disclose your identity to them? You should be able to obtain the Sinful Fire Divine Rune if you do, right?” Lin Yun asked.

Lil’ Purple rolled her eyes, “Why are you so stupid when you’re so smart? I was a deity-like existence in their hearts back then, so why do you want me to disclose my identity to them now? Furthermore, they followed me to the Kunlun Realm and stayed because of my mistake. I feel guilty, so why do you want me to disclose my identity?”

As she lay on the table, she sorrowfully muttered, “Furthermore, that statue in the plaza was how I looked in the past.”

Lin Yun widened his mouth as he briefly looked at Lil’ Purple’s face before he smiled, “I got it now, if you put it that way!

“Alright. Since you don’t want to disclose your identity to them, I’ll help you take the Sinful Fire Divine Rune,” Lin Yun said seriously.

“Really?” Lil’ Purple rejoiced.

“Really,” Lin Yun nodded.

“Hmph, you scumbag.” Lil’ Purple smiled before she returned to the Iris Secret Realm.

Lin Yun felt his arms aching before he found a quiet place in the courtyard to treat his injuries with the Blue Dragon Bone. When he opened his eyes, it was already the next morning, with sunlight shining down. He had recovered from all of his injuries. He moved his arms and turned around to verify that he was fine.

“That sword was really fast… Listening Wind Chime… It’s a pretty good name,” Lin Yun muttered as he recalled his fight with the Scarlet Radiant Saint Lord. Not only the last sword but how the Scarlet Radiant Saint Lord resolved his attacks was also breathtaking.

It didn’t matter if the Scarlet Radiant Saint Lord was an old man who suppressed his cultivation; he greatly benefited in this fight. He unsheathed the Flower Burial Sword, swung it around, and sank into it.

When he sheathed his sword, he discovered that the Astral River Saint Sovereign was here without him knowing. He asked, “Saint Sovereign, when have you arrived?”

“A long time ago, but I didn’t want to disturb you after seeing that you’re so focused.” The Astral River Saint Sovereign smiled, “These are gifts for you from the holy master.”

“You guys are too polite.” Lin Yun smiled and accepted them.

“Not going to take a look?” The Astral River Saint Sovereign smiled.

“There’s a surprise?” Lin Yun looked doubtful at the Astral River Saint Sovereign before opening the interspatial pouch. The first thing he saw was a crystal bottle, which Lin Yun recognized without opening it. He exclaimed in shock, “Divine dragon saint liquid?!”

“Yeah.” The Astral River Saint Sovereign nodded. He continued, “The holy master knows that you have high eyesight and doesn't want to be despised by you. So these 50kg of divine dragon saint liquid are for you.”

There were also Divine Phoenix Fruits, Divine Phoenix Pellets, many Saint Crystals, and various spiritual fruits that shocked Lin Yun. He took a deep breath after looking at the interspatial pouch. He said, “How generous.”

“You can use them. I’ll be back tomorrow.” The Astral River Saint Sovereign sent a deep look at Lin Yun before he left.

Lin Yun was still shocked and hadn’t come to his senses. Does that mean the Astral River Saint Sovereign will return with more resources?
