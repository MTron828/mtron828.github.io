Chapter 1202 - Breaking The Array!

This was Lin Yun’s trump card to break the balance. As layers of flowers appeared behind him, his aura reached the level of the Astral Stage. It was so shocking that the crowd looked at Lin Yun with shock.

Even Gong Haoran was silent because he didn’t believe it when Gongsun Yan said that Lin Yun had reached the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm. But now, he had no choice but to believe it.

As Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon roared, it caused a fluctuation in the Azure Dragon Sword Array.

In that split second, the Azure Dragon formed by the array was riddled with damage and the array began to dissipate. Slowly, the swordsmen who were hiding in the array were revealed. The middle-aged man roared when he saw this and said, “Stabilize it!”

Without any hesitation, all the swordsmen began to pour their origin energy into their swords to manifest the body of the dragon.

Lin Yun squinted his eyes with a cold flash in his pupils as he charged forward. Once more, Lin Yun executed the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords. But this time, the entire sky turned dark.

“What’s going on?” Gong Haoran and Gongsun Yan were both surprised by this scene because Lin Yun this didn’t happen when Lin Yun executed the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords before. The power was completely different now. Despite their cultivation, they couldn’t see anything happening anymore.

At this moment, everyone aside from elders in the Elysium Core Realm had become blind. When a loud explosion sounded out in the darkness, the scene of two Azure Dragons clashing was deeply imprinted in everyone’s mind. But the Azure Dragon manifested by the Azure Dragon Sword Array was sent flying a few hundred meters away.

“He won?” The hearts of Zhao Yan and the others began to throb violently because they knew that one could only rely on brute strength or an even more powerful sword array to make it through the second round.

No one in the past had succeeded despite knowing this. Logically, it was impossible for everyone since their cultivation level was sealed. But the fact that Lin Yun actually won in a head-on confrontation had left all the geniuses on the empyrean ranking shocked because they couldn’t imagine how strong Lin Yun would become after reaching the empyrean realm.

“Storm Clouds and Wind!”

“Firmament Stirring Clouds!”

“Clouds Manifesting Dragon!”

……

“Soaring Azure Sky!” Lin Yun one unleashed the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords, but they looked completely different from before. The empowerment of the 49 flowers really changed the might of his technique.

As Lin Yun moved, his Azure Dragon Sword Aura continued to rumble. After unleashing the ninth sword, the Azure Dragon Sword Array began to crumble. The swordsmen in the formation started to fly out of the array with blood dripping from their lips. In the end, there was only one azure dragon left and it was the one created by Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon Sword Aura.

“Die!” Lin Yun showed no intention of stopping as he charged at the middle-aged man without any hesitation. The middle-aged man was the core of the array, so Lin Yun could make it through as long as the middle-aged man was heavily injured.

“Is he really going to break through the array?” This scene made everyone’s eyes light up nervously. After all, no one had survived the second round in the last 18 years and no one ever destroyed the array head-on like Lin Yun did. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Azure Dragon Into The Ocean!” The middle-aged man roared as Lin Yun charged at him. Upon receiving his order, the swordsmen who were on the ground quickly got into position and raised their swords.

“Water intent?” Lin Yun was surprised that all the swordsmen had grasped water intent. When their sword intent spread out, a colossal Azure Dragon started to take form.

Lin Yun, who was inside of the array, was being restricted. So the middle-aged man let out another roar before all the swordsmen formed the Azure Dragon Constellation.

However, this time they weren’t in seven different groups. All of the swordsmen were part of one group that made the array even stronger. When they were done, they charged at Lin Yun together.

“The game has just begun!” The middle-aged man grinned and barked, “Azure Dragon’s Eyes!”

The middle-aged man released two dazzling sword rays that looked like the eyes of an Azure Dragon that pierced through Lin Yun’s sword aura. Then, the rest of the swordsmen followed to claim Lin Yun’s life.

“Azure Dragon’s Claw!”

……

“Azure Dragon’s Tail!”

Lin Yun saw this scene and had a feeling that he could reach the divine firmament sword intent after this battle. However, the most important thing right now was to make it past the second round.

“Can he really afford to be distracted?” Zhao Yan instantly knew what Lin Yun was thinking because he would occasionally wear the same facial expression. The discovery made Zhao Yan feel speechless because he had no idea what to say about Lin Yun.

“Let’s end this game!” Lin Yun took a deep breath because he didn’t want to drag the battle out any longer. In a single breath, Lin Yun executed the 11th and 12th swords of his sword technique. As a boundless ocean of clouds opened up behind him, the Azure Dragon Sword Aura formed a vortex of dragon shaped clouds.

The vortex at the tip of his sword instantly destroyed the two dragon claws and caused the formation of swordsmen to fall apart.

At this moment, it seemed like Lin Yun was standing on top of a mountain and looking down on everyone.

“R-R-Retreat!” The middle-aged man was terrified and gave orders to leave the array.

“You can’t leave!” Lin Yun smiled and slowly raised the Flower Burial Sword in his hand. When his gaze fell onto his sword, he wore a solemn expression and his blood boiled within his body.

With an ancient bell sound rang out in everyone’s ears, the audience was shocked. “Dao note! The bell of sword dao!”

The elders from the various clans were also shocked to hear the bell ring. As a starry sky unfolded in the sky, the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermillion Bird, and Black Tortoise Constellations could be faintly seen. Lin Yun had relied on his sword aura to break through the first layer of heaven.

Then, Lin Yun disappeared from his spot and appeared in front of the middle-aged man. With starlight shining on him, Lin Yun swung his sword.

His sword sliced the ocean formed by water intent in half, which sent all of the swordsmen flying. The middle-aged man only lasted for a brief moment before he was sent flying away while glaring at Lin Yun with reluctance.

Suddenly, he exploded into a bloody mist. At this moment, everyone’s gazes were on the Flower Burial Sword in Lin Yun’s hand because the Azure Dragon Sword Array had been broken.

At this moment, everyone could feel their throats tighten. Even Feng Xuanzi’s face changed at this scene. He was fine throughout the battle, but now his body was trembling. It was so bad that he even threw up a mouthful of blood.

“The Azure Dragon Sword Array? There’s nothing impressive about it.” Lin Yun turned to glance at Feng Xuanzi, causing the latter to throw up another mouthful of blood.
