Chapter 2396 - I’ll Grant You A Defeat

Sword rays suddenly streaked across the stage and flew at Ji Zixi. One could only imagine how Ji Zixi could block this attack using the Phoenix King Crown.

Just when Xiong Tiannan was baffled after hearing what Lin Jiangxian said, a wind blew as Lin Yun disappeared. When he turned around, Lin Yun came to the Heavenly Barren Divine Stage, taking Ji Zixi into his embrace, and retreated. The sword rays unleashed by Bai Ye landed on the ground, and the swords managed to stab into the stage forged with Dragon Runic Metal.

“Big Brother Lin.” Ji Zixi came to her senses and raised her head to look at Lin Yun, with her eyes becoming wet, looking pitiful. This was because she was only eighteen, and she fell for Bai Ye’s words and wanted to vent her emotions.

Seeing this, Bai Ye arrogantly sneered, “Good. You two can come at me together. A mere Heavenly Phoenix Maiden isn’t enough for my warm-up.”

“Big Brother Lin, I lost.” Ji Zixi’s eyes were watery with reluctance.

“It’s fine, go back,” Lin Yun smiled. He caressed Ji Zixi’s head to comfort her, and this intimate action drew everyone’s attention.

This scene naturally made Bai Ye frown while the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son’s face became ugly. Didn’t he already have a Heavenly Fragrance Divine Maiden? Why was he so close to the Heavenly Phoenix Maiden, then?

Lin Yun smiled and comforted Ji Zixi, asking her to leave. When Ji Zixi left, Lin Yun’s smile disappeared, and his eyes were filled with murderous intent when he looked at Bai Ye.

“You think that you’re a hero? Look at how old you are, and you’re bullying a little girl. How did the Heavenly Saint Courtyard teach garbage like you?” Lin Yun said.

Bai Ye’s face became ugly, and he coldly said, “Did I say anything incorrectly?”

“You still have the face to refute?” Lin Yun sneered. “Why didn’t you restrict your cultivation to when you were eighteen? You’re close to a hundred years old, and yet you have the cheek to say that it would be her victory if she managed to take ten moves from you? Aren’t you ashamed of yourself? Garbage like you wants to become the ancestral deity’s disciple? Are you joking with me?”

Everyone was shocked because they didn’t expect Lin Yun to say such words in the Heavenly Saint Courtyard.

Bai Ye’s face changed, and he roared, “You’re courting death!”

Before anyone could respond, he flapped the wings behind him, unleashing a powerful air current that made the surrounding space distorted. At the same time, the massive sword behind him vibrated as a mighty sword intent swept out from him, tearing the sky apart with an enormous world reflected in the radiance. This was the Heavenly Saint Courtyard’s strongest martial technique, the Primal Heaven Creation Art. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

It was a comprehensive martial technique, and this sword art was just a part of it. When Bai Ye executed it, his sword intent came in contact with the border of Bright Sun Sword Intent.

Exclamations resounded throughout the Heavenly Saint Courtyard as everyone recognized the Primal Heaven Creation Art, which could significantly boost any martial intent it empowers.

Bai Ye coldly said, “I don’t have to use this martial technique to deal with you, but since you dare humiliate my Heavenly Saint Courtyard, I’ll teach you a lesson with the martial technique created by the ancestral deity! Didn’t they say that you’re a peerless sword prodigy? I’ll let you know with this sword the true meaning of a swordsman!”

Bai Ye charged over with his sword aimed at Lin Yun’s chest. When a sword ray flew out, the phenomena in the sky began to expand as though an actual world was being created. Before his sword even arrived, the entire Heavenly Barren Divine Stage began to tremble violently as the vibrating noise made everyone’s ears hurt, with cracks appearing on the stage created by a mighty gale.

Everyone was shocked by the power of the Primal Heaven Creation Art.

“Flower Burial is finished!”

“Bai Ye is truly enraged.”

“Lin Yun deserves it. Did he really think that he’s a hero?”

“The fall of a legend.” Exclamations resounded from the surroundings, with everyone shocked by this sword.

But surprisingly, Lin Yun didn’t dodge and faced this attack head-on using his fingers as a sword. When they clashed, they produced a loud explosion as a Heavenly Dragon and a Divine Phoenix flew out from Lin Yun’s body. With the Heavenly Dragon and Divine Phoenix coiling around him, he was accompanied by a dragon’s roar and a phoenix's cry as his sword aura began to rise, with the Azure Saint Cloth fluttering in the wind.

The sword aura he gave off was so powerful that Bai Ye took three steps back before he looked at Lin Yun with disbelief.

“The Primal Heaven Creation Art? Doesn’t seem so impressive after all...” Lin Yun smiled, looking at Bai Ye. So what if the ancestral deity created the Primal Heaven Creation Art? The Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon at the eleventh stage wasn’t weak either, not to mention he still had the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron within his body.

“How is this possible?” Bai Ye was shocked. He gritted his teeth, “It looks like I have underestimated you...”

Lin Yun smiled, “You’re not going to tell me that you didn’t even use half of your strength, right? Anyhow, I didn’t even use one-tenth of my strength.”

His words were directed back at what Bai Ye had said to Ji Zixi earlier, and Lin Yun wanted to slap his face.

Bai Ye was enraged as he shone with a golden radiance, charging at Lin Yun.

As the crack in the sky continued to expand, the true power of the Primal Heaven Creation Art was slowly being unleashed.

But Lin Yun was calm as he swung his sword and retreated. No matter how powerful the Primal Heaven Creation Art was, Lin Yun could face it calmly, and he had no flaws, even if he didn’t use his sword. The commotion created by the Primal Heaven Creation Art was powerful, but it couldn’t do anything to Lin Yun.

Lin Yun suddenly stomped his foot, and arrived at the edge of the Heavenly Barren Divine Stage.

“A chance!” Bai Ye’s eyes lit up as he swung his sword, unleashing a dazzling radiance with primal chaos descending, sealing off the surrounding space. That was one of the nine Eternal Daos, the Primal Chaos Dao.

Bai Ye didn’t grasp it yet, but he could achieve a similar effect by relying on the Primal Heaven Creation Art. Under that power, Lin Yun’s body slowed as though time had stopped around him, and this trump card used by Bai Ye was perfect.

Suddenly, a sword vibration echoed from Lin Yun, and a sword ray pierced through the cracked sky, causing Bai Ye’s aura to fall, with the restriction broken, time-space returned to normal, and Bai Ye’s sword intent began to drop as well.

“It’s my turn now?” Lin Yun smiled as he charged forth, performing the Sovereign Dragon Seal and slamming it against Bai Ye’s chest. This sent Bai Ye flying away as he threw out blood.

“Is that the best you can do? I have yet to even warm up!” Lin Yun laughed and began slapping Bai Ye’s face, giving him ten-odd slaps before sending him flying. When Bai Ye landed on the ground, his head swelled with blood dripping from his lips.

Luo Tianxi’s face was ugly, along with the other direct disciples of the ancestral deity. Bai Ye was the chief disciple of the Heavenly Saint Courtyard, and Lin Yun was a little too ruthless.

“Lin Yun, I’ll kill you!” Bai Ye became mad with his hair scattered about, pushing the Primal Heaven Creation Art to the limit and charging at Lin Yun. His falling sword intent rose again, along with the aura he gave off. When he ran onto the stage, the entire stage began to tremble under his footsteps.

But Lin Yun’s gaze was cold as he roared, “Sword!”

The Flower Burial Sword entered his hand, and his sword aura skyrocketed when he held onto it. The Heavenly Dragon and Divine Phoenix also let out a roar before they charged down.

When the two swords clashed, Bai Ye’s sword was knocked flying away.

“You can’t even hold your sword well, and yet you want to teach me a lesson on behalf of the ancestral deity?” Lin Yun said coldly, looking at Bai Ye.

The surroundings fell silent as this was an outcome no one had expected. Bai Ye gave it his all, but he only received an even bigger humiliation instead.

“Get lost!” Lin Yun waved his left hand and Bai Ye’s clothes were torn apart when his palm landed on Bai Ye, sending the latter flying away and causing him to faint.

Lin Yun’s fighting spirit was high as he looked around.

“Flower Burial, do you dare to pick me?” The Heavenly Qilin Divine Son couldn’t hold himself back any longer, and rose to the sky, looking down at Lin Yun.

“Come, I’ll grant you a defeat!” Lin Yun said coldly.
