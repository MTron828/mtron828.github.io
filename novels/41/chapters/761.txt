Chapter 762 - A Friend's Departure!

Lin Yun killed Wen Yanbo after three punches. More accurately, he only used one punch to kill Wen Yanbo. So it didn’t really matter that he used three punches in total. Just like that, the turmoil caused by the Primal Origin Sect over the last six months was resolved by Lin Yun. All he needed to do was kill their Heavenly Soul Realm sect master.

His death would surely set off huge waves in the Great Qin Empire. But in Lin Yun’s view, killing Wen Yanbo was nothing because he had gained many experiences over the last year while traveling. He was no longer the person he was before.

“He’s dead?” Luo Feng looked at this scene with disbelief. Even the disciples behind him were dumbfounded. Since when did Lin Yun become so strong? It had only been a year, but Lin Yun already grew beyond their imagination. This had a profound effect on them.

There was no question that going on a journey would widen one’s journey. However, opportunities were usually accompanied with dangers. For instance, many people would die whenever a secret realm opened. In fact, those who survived, like Lin Yun and Zuo Yun, weren’t ordinary. As for those who could accomplish what Lin Yun accomplished were few in numbers even in the entire Ancient Southern Domain. Not everyone had the qualifications to be compared with Lin Yun.

“Go back and disperse the Primal Origin Sect. Otherwise, I won’t mind taking a trip to the Primal Origin Sect to settle things myself,” said Lin Yun as he looked at the Primal Origin Sect’s elders. None of them had imagined that Wen Yanbo would be killed in just one punch.

“What?” All the elders were dumbfounded upon hearing what Lin Yun said. Lin Yun actually wanted to disperse the Primal Origin Sect, a sect that stood in the Great Qin Empire for thousands of years. Furthermore, it had fought with the Sword Firmament Pavilion for thousands of years and survived.

“Was I not clear enough?” Lin Yun asked them calmly with a cold light flashing in his eyes. Someone ultimately had to pay the price for Wen Yanbo’s deeds and he was already being benevolent by giving them the opportunity to disperse themselves. They were lucky that Lin Yun wasn’t trying to annihilate them.

“This…” All the elders trembled in fear while their faces turned pale. “We’ll pass your words to the grand elders. We’ll take our leave first.”

The elders were disheartened as Wen Yanbo was killed by Lin Yun in one punch. The Primal Origin Sect no longer had the qualification to fight Lin Yun. Even if Lin Yun wanted to disperse the Primal Origin Sect, the grand elders couldn’t utter a single word. How could they retaliate when Lin Yun even had a demonic beast by his side that was more terrifying than him. That demonic beast alone could annihilate the Primal Origin Sect.

“Lin Yun, do you really have to do that?” Luo Feng asked with his brows frowned as he was worried that it was a little too ruthless.

“Wen Yanbo, that fake Heavenly Soul Realm, dared to act with such arrogance. If I wasn’t strong enough, he would have already put an end to the Sword Firmament Pavilion. I’m already being benevolent to the Primal Origin Sect.” Lin Yun paused briefly before he continued, “The Primal Origin Sect tried to assassinate me several times, so I would have gone after them even if they didn’t come to me.”

Luo Feng no longer said a word when he heard that. As for the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s disciples, they cheered because they were tired of the Primal Origin Sect’s bullying. Lin Yun had resolved all the bitterness from the past six months and established the pavilion’s prestige.

Barely one day passed before Lin Yun’s deed spread throughout the Great Qin Empire. The news shocked all the empire’s forces. When they confirmed the news, they realized that Lin Yun was a lot stronger than rumored because he had even subdued an overlord Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beast. If he wanted, he could annihilate the Primal Origin Sect whenever he wished.

Two days later, another piece of news shocked everyone in the Great Qin Empire. One of the four major sects of the empire, the Primal Origin Sect, suddenly announced that it would disband. In the end, they took Lin Yun’s threat seriously.

With that, Lin Yun’s name spread throughout the Great Qin Empire and he became the center of attention. Lin Yun was the center of attention in the Dragon Gate Competition, but no one had expected that he would become this terrifying after one year. This kind of growth exceeded everyone’s expectations.

Many people believed that the Great Qin Empire had truly produced an absolute genius this time, one that could shine brightly in the Draconic Banquet. Everyone was filled with anticipation to see how far their Great Qin Empire’s swordsman would go in the Draconic Banquet.

As for Lin Yun, he received shocking news from his friends in the pavilion. Li Wuyou, the goofy brat who claimed he would be the strongest swordsman in the Great Qin Empire, left after taking something from the pavilion.

Mo Cheng, who was now in charge of Locket Mountain, also said that Li Wuyou left a letter for Lin Yun.

“Did senior sister return?” Lin Yun asked.

The moment Xin Yan was mentioned, Mo Cheng’s eyes turned dim before he sighed, “There’s no news about her. We were able to obtain bits and pieces of news that pertained to you, but never anything about senior sister.”

Lin Yun was briefly stunned when he heard that. It seemed like Xin Yan had really left for good. But Xin Yan’s martial soul wasn’t simple, so she would probably be fine on her own. But who knew if they would really meet again? Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Lin Yun was briefly depressed before he organized his thoughts and went to retrieve the letter Li Wuyou left him. That boy had always been immature and silly ever since they first met. However, the Astral Star Art that he cultivated was so profound that not even Lin Yun could see through it.

Furthermore, the latter didn’t consume any pellets while in the xiantian realm, which made Lin Yun speculate that his origin wasn’t simple. But he never would have thought that Li Wuyou would suddenly leave before they were reunited.

The Soul Sword Pavilion was also one of Sword Firmament Pavilion’s five great lands. Lin Yun had visited the Myriad Sword Platform and Burial Sword Peak many times, but this was his first visit to the Soul Sword Pavilion. The Soul Sword Pavilion was also considered a forbidden ground in the sect.

But the entire journey was smooth for Lin Yun because he had a unique position in the sect. Furthermore, Guardian Plum had also informed everyone of Lin Yun’s position before he went into seclusion. All the elders knew that Lin Yun would represent the Sword Firmament Pavilion during the Draconic Banquet and they treated him with respect.

There was a purple-clothed old man guarding the chamber. His cultivation was in the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm. Although it was nothing to Lin Yun, he was considered a peak expert in the Great Qin Empire.

“Li Wuyou’s ancestor was a friend of Ancestor Jian Wuming. Li Wuyou’s ancestor left something in the Soul Sword Pavilion, saying that his descendant would come for it in the future. So he requested the Sword Firmament Pavilion to guard it and to give it to his descendant if they could pass his test,” said the purple-clothed old man.

“What was it?” Lin Yun asked.

“A Kunlun Jade with a droplet of the Vermillion Bird’s divine blood sealed inside,” said the purple-clothed old man.

Lin Yun was shocked when he heard that. That’s a treasure that not even an empyrean can guard. It was actually hidden in a sect like the Sword Firmament Pavilion? If someone coveted it, would the Sword Firmament Pavilion actually be able to protect it?

But Lin Yun soon figured it out. Even if the news got out, no one would believe it. This meant that the Sword Firmament Pavilion would be the safest place to store it.

“This is his letter.” The old man took out a letter and handed it to Lin Yun, which Lin Yun immediately opened.

“Big brother, by the time you read this letter, I would have already left the Ancient Southern Domain. My background is complicated and I can’t put it in simple words. I come from a bigger world and I’m here to retrieve the divine blood left behind by my ancestor. I’m glad I got to be acquainted with you in the Sword Firmament Pavilion and you will always be my brother in this life no matter what. I won’t forget what we experienced together.”

“I really want to see you shine brightly in the Draconic Banquet, but I don’t have much time left. I’m a descendant of the Li Clan, so I have a responsibility to take this divine blood. Big brother, a new era is arriving and I believe we will meet again someday. I will wait for you in this world to trample on everyone with your sword…”

Li Wuyou’s letter was long and his handwriting was in a mess. Lin Yun could tell that Li Wuyou left in a hurry, but Lin Yun could feel Li Wuyou’s emotions in the letter.

“You brat…” Lin Yun smiled after he finished reading the letter. Li Wuyou probably obtained the divine blood to search for his own path. Don’t worry, brother. I will go to your world with my sword and reunite with you one day.

Lin Yun stored the letter as he radiated with confidence. He was making his promise as a man. He was now filled with curiosity for the ‘bigger world’.
