Chapter 1549 - You're Not Guilty

Heaven had nine skies, and each sky had four layers. The Nether Divinity Clan was located in the first layer of the ninth sky, commonly known as the thirty-third layer of heaven. Only saints could tear apart the layers of heaven and reach the ninth sky.

The thirty-six layers were barriers, and they were also cages. There were countless secrets hidden in the thirty-six layers, and no one knew if the Kunlun Realm or the thirty-six layers existed first.

Tian Xuanzi easily tore apart the layers of heaven, carrying the Azureflame Saint Lord to the thirty-third layer of heaven. This place looked desolate, and the atmosphere was filled with terrifying cloud lumps. Occasionally, floating lands could be seen like fragments of stars.

Occasionally, gigantic astral beasts could also be seen, and those astral beasts were emitting ancient auras. Anyone could easily tell that those astral beasts possessed the bloodline of ancient demonic beasts. It wasn’t an exaggeration to call them legacies, and not every saint could travel in this region.

Tian Xuanzi and the Azureflame Saint Lord were traveling at an unbelievable speed. Half a day later, a nebula appeared before them, and they had to pass through it to reach the Nether Divinity War Realm.

Most astral realms in the ninth sky were barren worlds, and few could support life. Most of them had a harsh environment that even saints didn’t dare to stay in for long, and only some astral beasts could survive in those environments.

It wasn’t easy finding an astral realm that supported life, and the Nether Divinity War Realm was one of them. Not only that, but the Nether Divinity War Realm had an ancient inheritance containing ancient secrets. The Nether Divinity War Realm was bestowed to the Nether Divinity Clan because of the Nether Divinity Ancestor’s contributions to the Divine Dragon Empire.

The war realm allowed the Nether Divinity Clan to become the leader of all saint clans in the Ancient Barren Domain. They have been gradually accumulating their strength, and they would be comparable to Ancient Saint Clans if they managed to accumulate for a few thousand years more.

The Azureflame Saint Lord was nervous as he held onto Indigothunder Saint Lord’s decapitated head. He was trembling in fear, and couldn’t even budge. After all, the Indigothunder Saint Lord’s death was a massive blow to him, striking his heart with a great amount of fear, and his mentality nearly collapsed because of it.

He was greatly terrified by Tian Xuanzi’s strength. He never expected that Tian Xuanzi would dare to kill the Indigothunder Saint Lord. But what made him even more afraid was that Tian Xuanzi wanted to head to the Nether Divinity War Realm. The Azureflame Saint Lord couldn’t even imagine what would happen when Tian Xuanzi met the ancestor of their Nether Divinity Clan.

“How nostalgic…” Tian Xuanzi reminisced while looking at the Nether Divinity War Realm. His brow bone was longer than others. Matched with his smooth curls, it gave him a peculiar style. Tian Xuanzi was born in the Divine Dragon Empire. Before he reached the Dragon Pulse Realm, he spent most of his time in the Nether Divinity War Realm.

So he was naturally familiar with the Nether Divinity Ancestor. As his memories surfaced before his eyes, Tian Xuanzi squinted his pupils with a cold light flashing within them. After all, those times weren’t beautiful memories. Since he was young, he was bullied by the direct descendants, and the Nether Divinity Ancestor only used him as a tool, wanting him to control the Profound Sky Sect on behalf of the Qin Saint Clan. But despite the terrible past, Tian Xuanzi still decided to come to the Nether Divinity War Realm.

“Let’s go.” Tian Xuanzi smiled. He was clearly doing something insane, but his smile was even more terrifying.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The Azureflame Saint Lord couldn’t see through what Tian Xuanzi was thinking. The clouds split as they passed through the nebula vortex, and a world appeared before them. The Nether Divinity War Realm was massive and comparable to the Profound Amber Realm that Lin Yun was from. In terms of spiritual energy density, it wasn’t at all inferior to the Kunlun Realm.

This world had lots of native humans that established various empires and forces. But the Nether Divinity Clan was like a god in this realm, absorbing all the resources for themselves and grasping the core inheritance to provide an endless supply of treasures and geniuses for the Nether Divinity Clan in the Ancient Barren Domain.

Tian Xuanzi’s speed was fast, and he soon arrived at the north pole of the Nether Divinity War Realm. This place was a complete wasteland filled with an ancient aura. On this wasteland, there was a bronze mountain. The size of this bronze mountain reached a few myriad miles, and there was a palace situated at the top of the mountain, known as the Nether Divinity Palace.

“Tian Xuanzi killed the Qin Saint Clan’s saint lord by mistake, and I’m here to seek forgiveness from the ancestor!” A crisp voice echoed within the wasteland.

When that voice echoed, countless figures soared into the sky, looking at Tian Xuanzi with shock and fury within their pupils. Simultaneously, waves of terrifying saint aura exploded from the palace that soon reached every corner of this continent. In the next moment, a robust figure walked out from the palace.

“Ancestor!” Everyone in mid-air greeted that person with a bow.

“Tian Xuanzi, since you’re here to seek forgiveness, why aren’t you on your knees?” A majestic voice echoed. The Azureflame Saint Lord, who was beside Tian Xuanzi, had long fallen onto the ground with the Indigothunder Saint Lord’s head rolling to the side.

“I’m injured. So I as for etiquette to be exempted.” Tian Xuanzi replied.

“Tian Xuanzi, how dare you!”

“Tian Xuanzi, get down on your knees, and the ancestor might consider sparing your life!”

“Tian Xuanzi, you ingrate! How dare you come to the Nether Divinity War Realm after killing the Indigothunder Saint Lord!” The elders of the Qin Saint Clan within the surroundings furiously roared when they saw how rude Tian Xuanzi was being.

“Hahaha! You guys must be joking!” Tian Xuanzi laughed and waved his hand, igniting the Indigothunder Saint Lord’s head. The head then flew towards the palace like a meteorite with boundless pressure.

He then squinted his eyes, watching the head approach that palace. He was probing to see how strong that old fellow was. When the head approached the palace, it was destroyed by a majestic force. As the head fell apart like fireworks, the remnants left huge craters on the ground, causing the entire continent to tremble with various phenomena appearing.

“Since the ancestor destroyed Indigothunder Saint Lord’s head, I bet I’m forgiven. After all, the Indigothunder Saint Lord was at fault for being rude.” Tian Xuanzi looked at the palace as he gave off boundless arrogance.

His words nearly made everyone from the Nether Divinity Clan throw out blood, but no one dared to make a move against Tian Xuanzi, including the saints within the palace.

When everyone was furious, a black radiance formed into a giant palm that flew towards Tian Xuanzi. The black palm had distorted the entire space with stars engraved on the fingers. At the heart of the palm, there was a divine rune with countless saint runes that revolved and formed into a profound vortex.

Cracks began to spread out from the palm, with flames enveloping it. But Tian Xuanzi didn’t move or even take a step. When the palm was about to descend, a bizarre scene occurred. The palm began to slow down as it got closer to Tian Xuanzi. In the end, it even looked like time had stopped around Tian Xuanzi.

In another painting that no one could see, it was a space of its own with countless flowers blooming and withering, repeating the cycle again and again. As flowers bloomed and withered, Tian Xuanzi kept retreating, and the world behind him was like a revolving kaleidoscope.

“Heavenly Moon! Heavenly Sun! Heavenly Gold! Heavenly Wood! Heavenly Water! Heavenly Fire! Heavenly Earth!” As seven radiants appeared, there was a terrifying figure within each radiant that looked like a dignified deity. But that palm was too scary. The eternal flames from the divine rune made it look like the palm of an ancient god.

When the palm pressed down, fine cracks appeared on the seven radiants, waiting for the divine rune to reach the limit. When the palm utterly ignited, it looked like the palm had grabbed onto Tian Xuanzi from the outside world.

As the painting shattered, fragments drifted out from the gigantic palm, and those fragments looked like pieces of paper from the painting, emitting a faint radiance.

Everyone from the Qin Saint Clan became excited, but their smiles froze soon after as a terrifying explosion echoed, and fine cracks began to spread out. As the massive palm shattered, a huge crater appeared on the ground.

While Tian Xuanzi hovered in the air, he was radiating a terrifying aura, and that was the last stage of the Profound Sky Canon—Tribulation Heaven!

As the fragments returned to Tian Xuanzi’s body, his body became blurred again, giving others a feeling that he was in a painting and wasn’t real.

“Indigothunder Saint Lord was rude at first and deserved to be killed. You’re not guilty of killing him.” A deep voice echoed from the palace that shocked everyone.

“Tian Xuanzi thanks the ancestor!” Tian Xuanzi laughed as he turned into a golden streak of light, leaving the Nether Divinity War Realm.
