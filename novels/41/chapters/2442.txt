Chapter 2443 - You Want To Learn? I Can Teach You!

Hearing that Lin Yun agreed to his challenge, the Light Subduing Great Saint smiled. But a figure dashed out, charging at Lin Yun, “There’s no need for the sect master to deal with someone like him!” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The person who charged out was the Profound Thunder Great Saint of the Ming Cult. He was at the pinnacle of the first stage, proficient in the Great Solar Dao, and had manifested the Great Solar Domain. His speed was fast, exchanging a palm with Lin Yun before anyone could respond.

With an exchange, Lin Yun was forced to take ten-odd steps back. But Lin Yun wasn’t injured since the impact was negated while he retreated.

“Not bad.” The Profound Thunder Great Saint smiled. He might be probing Lin Yun’s strength with his earlier attack; it could inflict heavy injuries against an ordinary Saint Sovereign or even kill them. But Lin Yun negated the force behind the impact as he retreated, and this alone was enough to tell that Lin Yun wasn’t simple.

“Come again!” The Profound Thunder Great Saint charged again, releasing the Great Solar Domain and executing a palm technique towards Lin Yun. He was using the Great Solar Palm of the Ming Cult, which was famous for frontal confrontation since no other dragon spirit martial technique was more suitable for a frontal confrontation.

Each of his palms radiated with golden light, shining like a bright sun. Tens of thousands of saint daos enveloped it, and the power of the palm caused a crater in space.

The Heavenly Sever Great Saint sneaked a peak at the Light Subduing Great Saint. He instantly understood everything when he saw the latter, who was wearing a playful smile. The Light Subduing Great Saint learned from his lesson with Su Ziyao and wanted to gauge Lin Yun’s strength before fighting.

Since he was caught by surprise by Su Ziyao, the reputation as head of Black Mountain’s seven saints was almost lost.

The Profound Thunder Great Saint was someone the Light Subduing Great Saint arranged to probe Lin Yun’s strength. This was to ensure that the Light Subduing Great Saint wouldn’t be caught by surprise like him.

Sensing the Heavenly Sever Great Saint’s gaze, the Light Subduing Great Saint turned to look at him with a smile, making the Heavenly Sever Great Saint’s face ugly.

“Light Subduing, someone who is the sect master of a holy land like you has resorted to such despicable means!” Jian Jingtian roared. All the Great Saints present knew what was going on, and those with a higher reputation naturally had more tricks up their sleeves. This was because they couldn’t afford a loss.

The Light Subduing Great Saint calmly said, “The Profound Thunder Great Saint is a little impatient, and I’ll reprimand him about it later.”

“Hahaha! Why are you all in such a hurry? If Flower Burial can’t defeat me, how will he fight the sect master?” The Profound Thunder Great Saint laughed arrogantly. He was suppressing Lin Yun throughout the fight since Lin Yun was only a Saint Sovereign. He sneered, “Flower Burial, is this the best you can do? Weren’t you arrogant earlier?”

He was trying to use words to provoke Lin Yun into revealing his trump cards.

“Sure!” Lin Yun smiled. He also tested to see the difference between their cultivations without using his trump cards. But the outcome was surprising because the difference wasn’t as big as he had imagined. The Divine Dragon Sovereign Physique already bore a large portion of the damages, and his injuries recovered without even using the Blue Dragon Bone.

He didn’t dodge as he took the Profound Thunder Great Saint’s attack head-on. The palm landed on his chest, with flames blazing on it.

“Is this your best?” The Profound Thunder Great Saint smiled. “Do you know how powerful this attack of mine is? Any saint physique taking it head-on will be dissolved by the Great Solar Flame, even their bones.”

But no matter how the flame blazed, Lin Yun was unscathed, with his hair fluttering in the wind and each strand shone brightly. This made him look even more sacred as his saint daos manifested into a golden lotus behind him, representing the Sword Dao.

The lotus had transformed, giving off a dazzling radiance that gave off the feeling that it could compete with Eternal Daos. There was no way the Profound Thunder Great Saint’s saint daos could compete with the sword dao.

“How is this possible?!” The Profound Thunder Great Saint was shocked, with disbelief in his eyes. The other Great Saints were also shocked, unable to comprehend what was happening before them. No one would be shocked if Lin Yun used his sword to defeat the Profound Thunder Great Saint, since Lin Yun was famous for his talent with the sword.

But what was going on now? Lin Yun took a palm from the Profound Thunder Great Saint head-on, and not even a strand of hair was harmed?

“How is this possible? My physique is no longer a saint physique!” Lin Yun laughed, spreading out his palms and raising them. A dragon’s roar echoed from within his body, accompanied by a powerful aura as a dragon’s head appeared on his chest.

A powerful aura belonging to a supreme dragon swept out, shattering the Profound Thunder Great Saint’s Great Solar Flame. This made the Profound Thunder Great Saint’s cheeks tremble before his face began to distort, sending him flying away.

“Didn’t you want to experience my full strength?” Lin Yun looked at the Profound Thunder Great Saint with a smile. But he gave off a domineering aura in the eyes of others, looking like a young monarch.

“Divine Dragon Physique, the unrivaled body-refining technique of the Dragon Clan... Wasn’t it long lost in the Kunlun Realm? How did you manage to succeed in practicing it?!” The Profound Thunder Great Saint said with his hands trembling and eyes filled with disbelief. The Divine Dragon Physique was famous in ancient times because it was hard to achieve, requiring one to undergo multiple tribulations. But if someone succeeded in practicing it, it could be comparable to any innate divine physique in the world.

“That’s the Divine Dragon Sovereign Physique! Don’t tell me you don’t recognize the Sovereign Dragon Seal?” The Azure Python Great Saint said with disdain but also suffered a great shock. He now knew why Lin Yun didn’t seem excited when he was given the Divine Azure Overlord Physique. It turned out that Lin Yun already had his own path.

The Azure Python Great Saint had envy in his eyes, looking at Lin Yun. The Divine Dragon Sovereign Physique was the dream of many Dragon Clan great saints.

Everyone’s faces changed upon hearing that. The Divine Dragon Physique was already invincible, and they couldn’t imagine how powerful the Divine Dragon Sovereign Physique would be.

“Profound Thunder, come back,” the Light Subduing Great Saint said with a grave expression.

But the Profound Thunder Great Saint gritted his teeth, “So what if it’s the Divine Dragon Sovereign Physique? You’re only a Saint Sovereign. What can you do to me?”

Not giving up, the Profound Thunder Great Saint roared, “Great Solar Demon Hand!”

This was a forbidden technique of the Sun-Moon Saint Canon that could perfectly control one’s domain. It was a secret technique far exceeding dragon spirit martial technique. The Profound Thunder Great Saint wanted to hold the advantage in the fight to retain his face before returning.

The clouds in the sky became black before a giant palm manifested and slammed down.

Lin Yun had no change on his face as he turned around, and the golden lotus behind him released a dazzling sword ray, dying the sky in gold. That was the eighth-grade sword intent, the Bright Sun Sword Intent. Under his sword intent, fine cracks appeared on the palm before Lin Yun reached out, executing the Azure Dragon’s Rage.

The Azure Dragon’s Rage devoured the cracked domain as the giant palm gradually disappeared. When Lin Yun pushed his palm, the Profound Thunder Great Saint descended from the sky, creating a crater.

The Light Subduing Great Saint’s face sank. He instantly noticed that Lin Yun wanted to kill the Profound Thunder Great Saint and yelled, “Stop him!”

The remaining three great saints of the Ming Cult soared to the sky, wanting to save the Profound Thunder Great Saint. But Lin Yun’s speed was too fast and he pushed his palms forth, crushing the Profound Thunder Great Saint’s head like a fly.

Pushing his hands forward, the headless corpse shattered into countless pieces, only leaving behind the saint origin. Before reaching the third-stage of the Great Saint Realm, Great Saints weren't that tough to kill.

Everything happened in the blink of an eye, which made everyone’s scalp numb. When the three Great Saints arrived, Lin Yun merely raised his eyes before taking out the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella. With the divine dragon physique, Lin Yun could control this sovereign artifact like his arm, summoning the Azure Dragon Constellation.

This scene frightened the three Great Saints, so their faces became pale.

“Come down!” Lin Yun easily opened the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella, causing the entire sky to tremble. The three Great Saints fell under pressure as they were sent flying back like three sandbags. When they landed on the ground, their bones shattered as they screamed out in pain, rolling on the ground and looking nothing like a Great Saint.

They had lost their ability to fight. With a shake of his arm, the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella began to spin, and it was unimaginable for a Sovereign Artifact to be so easily controlled.

“Do you need me to display more of my strength? Light Subduing!” Lin Yun smiled, looking at the Light Subduing Great Saint with a provocative look.

“What impudence!” The Light Subduing Great Saint was enraged as he dashed towards Lin Yun, immediately summoning his Yin-Yang Dao without hesitation.

Lin Yun raised the umbrella above him as it began to spin. Nine dragon souls flew out from the umbrella and coiled around Lin Yun.

But the Light Subduing Great Saint was strong with a terrifying cultivation, pushing his Yin-Yang Dao to the limit and shattering the nine dragon souls with a palm. This instantly made everyone have a new perception of an Eternal Dao.

“Yin-Yang Dao? What a coincidence because I also know it!” Lin Yun smiled as a lotus representing an Eternal Dao bloomed behind him, and the dao diagram was more complicated than the Light Subduing Great Saint’s. Pushing his palm forward, the Yin-Yang Dao began to manifest into various phenomena.

The Light Subduing Great Saint couldn’t even completely release his Eternal Dao and yet Lin Yun was already done. Thus, the former was pushed away, taking a few steps back, and was dumbfounded while looking at Lin Yun’s performance.

A piece of heavenly music also began to resound with various golden figures surrounding Scarlet Firmament Peak. This was a sign that Lin Yun was also a myth!

“You want to learn about it? I can teach you!” Lin Yun smiled. His smile sent the Light Subduing Great Saint into ice and he retreated. He didn’t retreat from Lin Yun's attack but was genuinely shocked.
