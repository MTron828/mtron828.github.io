Chapter 1769 – Romance Under The Moonlight

When Mei Zihua turned, his gaze fell on Ye Ziling. His eyes lit up when he saw her tall figure and long legs. She had a unique temperament, glamorous with a hint of heroism, and this sort of temperament was attractive to everyone. The moment they appeared, Lin Yun, Mei Zihua, and everyone else on the ninth floor couldn’t help looking at her.

“What a beauty. It’s no wonder why you’re stunned.” Mei Zihua retracted his gaze and looked at Lin Yun with a smile. Because he didn’t bother concealing his voice, it was naturally heard by Ye Ziling, who was a hundred meters away, and there was a hint of displeasure within her pupils.

Gu Ruochen, the chief disciple of the Scarlet Firmament Peak, whispered in her ears. He seemed to have recognized Mei Zihua’s identity and told Ye Ziling about it.

Ye Ziling nodded before ignoring them. But when she was about to look away, she noticed another person sitting with Mei Zihua. That person covered his face with a wine cup and sleeves, making it impossible to see his face.

After the Sword Sect’s party was left at another table near the window, Lin Yun slowly lowered his cup. His Divine Tortoise Transformation was already at the manifestation stage. His disguise was much more perfect than before, and even his gaze had changed.

Even if he ran into Tian Xuanzi now, the other party wouldn’t be able to see through his disguise, but Lin Yun only came to his senses after hearing what Mei Zihua said. He knew this wasn’t the right time for them to reunite, and he didn’t want to cause trouble for them.

He roughly glanced at the Sword Sect’s party. Aside from Ye Ziling, there were many old friends around. There was the Sword Fanatic Zhao Yan, Divine Firmament Peak’s Gongsun Yan, Chief Disciple Gu Ruochen, Mu Xueqin, Ye Qingxuan, and Ji Shuxuan. All the younger generation geniuses of the Sword Sect were practically here.

He was also surprised that Ye Ziling led this party, but it seemed reasonable when he thought about it again. During the test back then, with the Divine Dragon Sword Physique, Ye Ziling’s talent was the strongest aside from Lin Yun. She possessed the White Dragon Saint Sword and even refined an ancient saint origin in the Ancient Barren Battlefield.

Thus, her strength had undergone a drastic transformation. But what were they doing here?

“Brother Lin, it looks like you’re the same kind of person as I am. Did you refuse my nine maids because Yue Weiwei was beside you? You can tell me immediately, and I can send the nine maids over later. You also don’t have to worry about them because they’re all virgins.” Mei Zihua smiled when he noticed Lin Yun was still staring in Ye Ziling’s direction.

Retracting his gaze, Lin Yun said, “Cut it out. They can hear it from this distance.”

“Brother Lin, you don’t have to try and put on an act. That lady’s beauty is peerless and she has a rare temperament. So it’s natural for any man to be attracted to her.” Mei Zihua smiled.

“They’re from the Sword Sect.” Lin Yun said.

Mei Zihua was briefly stunned upon hearing that before he said, “It’s no wonder why that person looks so familiar. So he’s the chief disciple of the Sword Sect, Gu Ruochen.”

“You know about him?”

“We’ve met before, I guess.” Mei Zihua replied. “They should be here for the Martial Dao Tea Party.”

“The Martial Dao Tea Party?” Lin Yun asked.

“What’s the matter? Do you think they’re not qualified? The Sword Sect is the strongest sect with the sword in the Ancient Barren Domain. After the Ancient Barren Battlefield, the Profound Sky Sect lost an entire golden generation of geniuses. So these people from the Sword Sect are the strongest batch of Dragon Pulse Realm experts in the Ancient Barren Domain. It’s only natural that the Autumn Mountain Lord would invite them to this Martial Dao Tea Party.” Mei Zihua smiled.

“The Martial Dao Tea Party isn’t just to compete for first rank, but also a place where Dragon Pulse Realm cultivators interact. All famous geniuses in the Eastern Desolation will be invited, and it’ll be grander than the Nirvana Banquet.” Mei Zihua didn’t hide his disdain for the Nirvana Banquet at all.

Lin Yun finally understood what was going on. After all, there would be improvements if there were interactions between cultivators. The Sword Sect gained a lot of benefits in the Ancient Barren Battlefield, and their current strength far surpassed the current younger generation of the Ancient Barren Domain.

In just saint elixirs alone, who knows how much they collected? Not to mention that Lin Yun also left behind the Nether Saint Sword to the Sword Sect, and they were all saint disciples. They were practically invincible amongst those of the same generation in the Ancient Barren Domain.

So there was no reason for them not to come to the Martial Dao Tea Party held by the Four Young Masters. This experience could broaden one’s horizon, and one could also compete with fellow geniuses to improve.

If he was still in the Sword Sect, he would be among them, right? Thinking about it, Lin Yun couldn’t help feeling a sense of sorrow.

“They’re strong amongst those of the younger generation but lack a leader. If Flower Burial was still around, I’m afraid even the holy lands’ geniuses wouldn’t dare to underestimate them.” Mei Zihua said. “But this batch of golden generation will need decades to centuries to rise. They were born in an untimely era.”

“What do you mean?” Lin Yun asked, raising the wine cup.

With a smile, Mei Zihua replied, “You don’t know about it? Who in the Eastern Desolation doesn’t know that the Radiant Sword Saint fell for Tian Xuanzi’s trap to save Flower Burial Lin Yun? He doesn’t have much lifespan left, so do you think the Sword Sect can continue to exist if he’s gone?”

The corner of Lin Yun’s lips twitched, but Mei Zihua didn’t notice it. Looking towards the Sword Sect’s party, he said, “Let’s go. Since I met their chief disciple before, I’ll bring you over to get acquainted with that lady.”

“Not interested.” Lin Yun got up and left.

“It looks like I can only go by myself, then…” Mei Zihua smiled.

But as soon as he turned around, Lin Yun grabbed the back of his collar and yanked him over. Coldly looking at Mei Zihua, he said, “I’ll castrate you if you dare to go after her.”

Mei Zihua could instantly feel a chill running down his spine, and he smiled, “Alright. I understand what you mean now. If anyone dares to go after her, I’ll help you castrate them.”

His words made Lin Yun speechless, and he shoved Mei Zihua back. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Looking at Lin Yun’s leaving figure, Mei Zihua raised his wine cup and smiled, “Looks like that fellow has a story. Lin Xiao, I wonder if that is your real name…”

After Lin Yun left the Thunderstorm Inn, he couldn’t help feeling restless and turned back to look at the inn. But when he turned around, his gaze coincidentally bumped into Ye Ziling’s gaze. When the two looked at each other, Lin Yun was stunned, and memories began to flash across his mind. When those memories flashed within his mind, a smile couldn’t help rising on his lips.

Ye Ziling was so unyielding back then, and she now shared some resemblance with her father. This made Lin Yun feel gratified, knowing his effort in the Ancient Barren Battlefield paid off.

I hereby swear that one day, the Sword Sect will return to become a holy land—eight thousand years of reign with our halo enveloping ninety thousand miles. As long as the moon exists, the Sword Sect never dies!

With a smile, Lin Yun turned around and headed toward the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion.

Lin Yun’s smile was captured by Ye Ziling, making her feel baffled.

“Junior Sister, what are you looking at?” Mu Xueqin curiously asked.

“I saw someone. He’s that person who seemed to be sitting opposite of Mei Zihua earlier.” Ye Ziling replied.

“Mei Zihua is an aloof, eccentric, and arrogant person. He disregards everything within his eyes, so I don’t think someone who can sit with him will be a good person.” Mu Xueqin said.

Nodding her head, Ye Ziling no longer said anything else.

Even after he had returned to the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion, Lin Yun had difficulty calming himself down. Taking a deep breath, he sat with his legs crossed and began to practice the Dual Dragon Saint Physique.

When he circulated the Blue Dragon Saint Physique, boundless lifeforce overflowed within his body. Circulating the Azure Dragon Saint Physique, he could also feel his vitality boiling. Without knowing it, the two dragons converged behind him, and the dragon aura he released was terrifying.

When he finally calmed down, he exhaled a mouthful of breath. After leaving his residence, Lin Yun came to the summit of the snowy mountain and saw Yue Weiwei seated within the blizzard. She was barefooted, and her eyes were slightly closed with moonlight shining from the sky, making her look like a serene and peaceful fairy.

Taking out the Thunderstorm Zither, he played the Ni Chang Dress Song.

Yue Weiwei opened her eyes and smiled sweetly before she soared to the sky and started dancing. She was like a fairy dancing on the lake when she performed the Nine Heavenly Profound Dance.

A song later, the ribbons around Yue Weiwei were like red waves, and she slid through the ribbons before arriving beside Lin Yun.

“Big Brother Lin, do you have something troubling your mind?" Yue Weiwei smiled softly as she blinked her eyes.

Lin Yun knew he couldn’t hide anything from her, nor had he thought about doing so. So he shared with Yue Weiwei what happened today and his encounter with the Sword Sect’s party.

“Big Brother Lin, look, what is this?” Yue Weiwei smiled.

“An invitation?” Lin Yun placed the Thunderstorm Zither aside and accepted Yue Weiwei's invitation. It was an invitation to the Martial Dao Tea Party. He was a little surprised, but nodded his head soon after.

As the Profound Fairy of the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion, it was natural that Yue Weiwei would be invited to the Martial Dao Tea Party. So regardless of whether she would turn up, the Autumn Mountain Lord would send an invitation.

“Big Brother Lin is going to the Heavenly Dao Sect, and I am interested in this Martial Dao Tea Party. Initially, I wasn’t planning on going. But since Big Brother Lin’s fellow disciples have come, let us go together.” Yue Weiwei smiled.

But Lin Yun looked at the invitation and fell into deep thought. This was because the Martial Dao Tea Party wasn’t part of his plan, and he wasn’t very interested when he initially heard about it from Mei Zihua. But after seeing the Sword Sect’s party, he could no longer calm his heart. He couldn’t just go and leave them behind. But how should he face them if he went?

“Big Brother Lin, I know you just want to know the current situation with the Sword Sect. So let us go together.” Yue Weiwei said softly and held onto Lin Yun’s hand. She knew Lin Yun would hesitate because he couldn’t forget them and would bring them trouble if he wasn’t careful.

“Weiwei will stand by your side no matter what happens. We agreed on this under the Three-Lives Tree.” Yue Weiwei looked at Lin Yun with a hint of determination within her pupils.

“Let’s go, then.” Lin Yun said. After saying that, he felt relaxed, and his restless heart calmed down. Only then did he realize he had already decided within his heart.

Seeing this, Yue Weiwei heaved a sigh of relief. She said something happy to distract Lin Yun from his concern, “Big Brother Lin, what did you see under the Three-Lives Tree at that time?”

“I saw many things and ended up seeing a sword that has beside you all along.” Lin Yun said truthfully.

Squinting her eyes, Yue Weiwei smiled joyfully, “That sword must be yours.”

“What about you?” Lin Yun asked.

Yue Weiwei’s face blushed when she heard Lin Yun’s question and bashfully lowered her head. But she ultimately raised her head and looked at Lin Yun, “Weiwei saw a baby.”

“Mine?” Lin Yun was a little taken aback. He had never considered this question before, which was why he couldn’t help being stunned.

Yue Weiwei instantly became angry, with her eyes widened. She roared, “Can it be someone else’s child, then? It’s definitely ours!”

Lin Yun knew that he had made a slip of the tongue there, and he quickly smiled, “But we haven’t…”

“Haven’t what?” Yue Weiwei quickly figured out what Lin Yun was saying, and she smiled, “Big Brother Lin, are you thinking about something dirty? No way, because you need to prepare betrothal gifts and get through my father's test. My father is a big baddie!”

Hearing that, Lin Yun couldn’t help smiling, and all the anxiety he had felt earlier disappeared under Yue Weiwei's smile. He knew she was trying to make him happy, so they leaned against each other by the lake, looking at the moonlight while they were chatting. There was only happiness between them, and they lost the concept of time.
