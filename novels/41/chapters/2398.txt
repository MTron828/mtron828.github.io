Chapter 2399 - Fight Till No One Dares to Fight!

Lin Yun's words left everyone briefly stunned before a burst of laughter broke out from the surroundings as all the male cultivators exchanged a gaze and laughed.

“Hahaha! This Lin Yun is really interesting!” Ye Wuhen of Heaven’s Gate also couldn’t help laughing. He had an opinion about Lin Yun earlier, especially when Luo Tianxi said Lin Yun was a peerless prodigy swordsman. But after witnessing Lin Yun’s strength, he had changed his mind about the latter. So, after hearing what Lin Yun said, he only felt that Lin Yun was an interesting person.

“What does it mean?” Xia Qingyun asked since she couldn’t get the joke.

“It’s nothing,” Ye Wuhan quickly shut his mouth.

“Petty,” Xia Qingyun snorted.

Others would give the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son some face, but Xiong Tiannan was hammering on the table, “Lin Yun is vicious! But I like it!”

Ao Jue also smiled upon seeing this.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

What Lin Yun said was lethal, and the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son’s face became ugly after he came to his senses. He roared, “What did you say? How dare you humiliate me!”

“Am I wrong? I’m an eighth-stage Saint Lord, and you’re a Quasi-Saint Sovereign. So how can you still be so stubborn even after losing to me? So what if I’m humiliating you?” Lin Yun smiled. “Don’t tell me you think you’ll be invincible after going to the Qilin Sword Immortal, right? You have no idea how strong I am in the Eternal Dao in comparison to you.”

“How dare you! I’m a deity’s descendant, and I’m the Qilin Mountain’s…” The Heavenly Qilin Divine Son roared furiously. But before finishing, Lin Yun pushed his palm forth and sent him flying away before falling to his knees.

“You’re courting death! Get lost!” Lin Yun no longer bothered with the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son and sent him flying away, kneeling.

“That fellow is arrogant,” Feng Bumao sighed. He was surprised that someone from the Kunlun Realm would be so strong. After all, the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son was a popular candidate. But to be defeated in such a humiliating way, it would be hard for the ancestral deity to take him in as a disciple.

“It’s fine for youngsters to be arrogant,” Luo Tianxi smiled, and his eyes were filled with admiration when he looked at Lin Yun.

On the stage, Lin Yun looked at Profound Sky Venerable, and asked, “Can I carry on my challenge?”

An uproar broke out from the surroundings. Lin Yun wants to challenge more after he just fought the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son? Isn’t he too arrogant?

Profound Sky Venerable was briefly stunned, before he said, “Sure. But are you sure about that? You can rest before challenging someone again.”

“There’s no need. I know many people doubt or dislike me, so I might as well pick on them one by one,” Lin Yun said. He swept his gaze to a direction, and asked, “Ji Zhangkong, you dare to fight me?”

Ji Zhangkong was a good friend of the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son, and he tried to embarrass Lin Yun at the gathering. Not to mention that he was a swordsman, the champion of the sixth testing ground.

Everyone was shocked because Lin Yun had just defeated the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son, and yet he wanted to challenge another champion? Wasn’t he too arrogant? Not to mention that he only picked on the strong.

Ji Zhangkong was surprised because he had witnessed Lin Yun’s strength from the earlier fight. It was fortunate that the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son had probed Lin Yun’s strength for him. If he went up the stage knowing nothing, he might lose due to carelessness. But now…

Ji Zhangkong smiled as he came onto the stage like a sword. When he landed, his body began to crystalize, and anyone could look through his skin and see his bones. His heart also looked like a burning cauldron, giving off a powerful sword aura. He said, “I have devoured at least ten thousand saint swords, and there are many Sovereign Saint Swords amongst them. I don’t know if the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son is hard, but I’m hard all over my body!”

Ji Zhangkong’s body began to ignite like flames as he stepped into Lin Yun’s Flaming Yin-Yang Painting. He wanted to end the battle quickly after witnessing Lin Yun’s strength. He had to defeat Lin Yun within ten moves, or he would lose based on Lin Yun’s sword aura.

Lin Yun had surpassed him in terms of sword mastery, and his talent was really envious.

With a stomp of his foot, fine cracks appeared on the Flaming Yin-Yang Painting. He summoned a sword and swung it down, “Your Yin-Yang Dao is lacking!”

In the path of his sword, space broke apart like ice, using brute force. He knew he had no advantage in technique, so he could only use brute force in his attack.

Lin Yun took a deep breath and faced Ji Zhangkong’s attack head-on with two hands wielding the Flower Burial Sword. When the two swords clashed, Lin Yun nearly lost his grip on the Flower Burial Sword, but he was agile and relied on the technique of Yin-Yang Dao to turn around before thrusting at Ji Zhangkong’s forehead.

Ji Zhangkong didn’t dodge, allowing the sword to land on his forehead, scaring all the spectators. But no blood splashed out, and a metallic clash resounded instead, with sparks flying out.

“I already said that I’m hard throughout my body!” Ji Zhangkong sneered and swung his sword without any tricks. When a sword ray flew out, a powerful sword aura swept out with signs of cutting apart the Flaming Yin-Yang Painting.

At such a close distance, they exchanged over five moves. Each move was heavy, as though they wanted to tear mountains apart.

“Those two are monsters!”

“Ji Zhangkong is smart. He knew that he couldn’t compete with Lin Yun in regards to sword mastery, so he could only rely on brute strength.”

“It’s not easy, but Ji Zhangkong really managed to do it, smashing the Yin-Yang Painting apart.” Everyone was shocked because Ji Zhangkong appeared to have an advantage in the fight.

Nine moves later, the Yin-Yang Painting broke apart and the dao flower representing Yin-Yang Dao became dim. Ji Zhangkong sneered, “Any more trump cards?”

He was confident that he only needed one sword to send Lin Yun flying away. But Lin Yun didn’t say anything as he circulated the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon and Great Profound Sword Canon. A boundless radiance shone out from his body as a Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron flew out from his violet palace and the two sword canons combined.

Lin Yun gave up on the Yin-Yang Sword that he only comprehended for a week and used the Divine Firefly Sword. The power of his sword continued to increase. This destructive aura from the cauldron even frightened him, and he decided not to use it if he had a choice.

Seeing Lin Yun’s sword aura rising with a river appearing, Ji Zhangkong’s face changed as he felt bad about it. The Great Solar Sacred Flames exploded on him, and he wanted to get close to Lin Yun once more, not wanting to allow Lin Yun to continue making a move.

But right then, he raised his head and saw Lin Yun’s eyes becoming crimson.

Lin Yun swung his sword as countless figures flew out from his body, each drawing a circle. As the circles began to overlap, his sword aura began to rise, and he only used a sword to sweep the Great Solar Sacred Flames that were on him with lotuses shattering on the stage.

As afterimages overlapped, ten thousand flowers bloomed, and Ji Zhangkong felt an uncontrollable power descending that devoured Ji Zhangkong before sending him flying away. But that wasn’t the end.

When Ji Zhangkong flew out, a flower bloomed as sixty-four figures each swung a sword. Each sword was a flower, and each petal was a sword. A boundless sword intent crashed down on Ji Zhangkong, making him throw out a mouthful of blood when he landed on the ground and was covered in wounds, leaving everyone frightened.

The wound on his hand was the most serious because Lin Yun’s sword had stabbed through it before entering his chest, piercing his heart. The flames in his heart ignited, and Ji Zhangkong’s face became pale.

“You’re hard throughout your body? Well, I did spend some time dealing with you.” Lin Yun looked at Ji Zhangkong as the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron descended from the sky.

Ji Zhangkong gritted his teeth because he could no longer fight if he lost, which meant he wouldn’t even be able to enter the top ten.

“I lost,” Ji Zhangkong said and left without lingering for another moment.

Everyone was dumbfounded because Ji Zhangkong was smart, and he wasn’t careless either. He even shattered Lin Yun’s Yin-Yang Painting. But he was still defeated by Lin Yun, who appeared to have countless trump cards.

Under the throne, the ancestral deity’s disciples couldn’t calm themselves down since this meant that Lin Yun had defeated two champions and one Bai Ye. The strength Lin Yun displayed was more than enough for him to become the ancestral deity’s disciple.

Everyone couldn’t help looking at Luo Tianxi, whose attention was on Lin Yun. The only question was if Lin Yun would carry on fighting and become the champion of the Heavenly Barren Banquet. The so-called “Champion” was meant to defeat everyone and fight till no one dared to stand out.

Lin Yun didn’t let them down and turned to look at Dugu Jue, the champion of the first testing ground.
