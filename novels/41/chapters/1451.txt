Chapter 1452 - I've Long Heard Of You!

This scene was too insane, and Lil’ Stone was utterly dumbfounded. Ever since he was born, he had never seen any disciple so desperate to put their lives on the line to absorb sword intent from the stone monument, especially since it was the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra.

As Lin Yun’s hair fluttered, his face became determined. He had one hand on the stone monument and the other holding onto the Bodhi Seed. His body began to tremble with crackling sounds coming from his bones. But he couldn’t be bothered to overthink it now since he was furious with the cauldron.

Today, he was determined to suppress it. It had been a long time since he had been so stubborn to accomplish something. The other time was when he was saving Yue Weiwei back on the Heavenly Path.

Lin Yun’s meridians were showing signs of erosion as the nether energy frantically poured into his body.

When all the nether energy entered his violet palace through his meridians, the nether energy collided with the cauldron, and the black aura exiting his body became even denser. The collision of the two energies put Lin Yun in enormous pain as the dragon runes on his body began to shatter. It wouldn’t take long before his physique came in direct contact the nether energy.

Without any hesitation, Lin Yun ignited the Blood Flame Divine Rune, allowing the dragon runes to undergo a rebirth.

“Devour!” Lin Yun roared as he used an even faster speed to devour the nether energy from the stone monument. The Bodhi Seed he was holding onto also began to shine with a sacred mantra resounding and a Bodhi Tree phenomenon was appearing behind him before it started to bloom.

Lin Yun was in great pain, but his consciousness was unprecedentedly clear, as if he was a Buddha in meditation. All the obscure parts of the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra cleared up as Lin Yun circulated the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra with his astral energy.

While Lin Yun circulated the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra, the cauldron was still expelling the nether energy within his body. But the nether energy that flowed into his body was more than what the cauldron could expel, not to mention that there was an endless supply of nether energy.

Lin Yun circulated the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra using this opportunity and tried to condense them together. An hour later, when the Blood Flame Divine Rune’s flames died out, the nether energy began to fuse and condense into a flower bud. As it underwent the budding process, it began to absorb the endless flow of nether energy.

The cauldron let out an unwilling roar. But when the flower bud was formed, half of the cauldron that appeared out of the ocean of astral energy was suppressed until only a quarter of the cauldron was exposed.

“I succeeded!” Lin Yun rejoiced with excitement on his face. He had finally succeeded in the first stage of the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra. His forehead was covered with sweat as the cracked dragon runes began to heal when the flower bud was formed in his violet palace. As the flower bud released vitality, it slowly recovered the vitality that was previously being eroded by the nether energy.

“But it’s not over yet!” Lin Yun’s face became determined. Since he had already come this far, he should try and see how far he could go. He wanted to suppress the cauldron entirely. After all, how could he possibly allow the cauldron to act rampantly before him?

The cauldron was still struggling, causing huge waves to rise on the ocean of astral energy. But it was destined to be unable to anything to resist!

An hour later, everyone who was cultivating outside the Great Profound Palace suddenly sensed a chilling sword intent that was approaching them and opened their eyes. When the sword ray dissipated and they saw the person who came, everyone’s faces changed. It was Huangfu Yan.

Moreover, he wasn’t alone. He had brought along the Azure Firmament Peak's disciples. Huangfu Yan’s title as ‘Prince Yan’ resounded throughout the Sword Sect. At the very least, every disciple knew about him. But this surprised everyone before they wondered if Huangfu Yan was here for Lin Yun.

“You, come over!” Huangfu Yan grabbed onto a random person before he barked, “Have you seen Lin Yun?”

“Senior Brother Huangfu, Lin Yun has already gone in…” That person calmly replied. But his forehead was covered in sweat when Huangfu Yan placed him down. At the same time, this confirmed that Huangfu Yan was here for Lin Yun!

Huangfu Yan was known to have a fiery temper. He usually acted with arrogance and tyranny. Aside from the other nine that were ahead of him on the Earth Ranking, he wasn’t convinced of anyone being better than him and would fight anyone who disagreed with him. This was the reason why everyone here was a little afraid of him.

When everyone realized Huangfu Yan’s objective, their expressions became weird. They didn’t think someone on the top ten of the Earth Ranking would actually come for Lin Yun, and there was a good show awaiting them now because Lin Yun would probably suffer quite a bit under Huangfu Yan.

Lin Yun was in the limelight, so someone would naturally be unhappy with him. But those who could enter the Earth Ranking were all smart, and they could tell that the sect master was fond of Lin Yun. So if they went to look for him without a valid reason, they would be in trouble instead.

But no one was surprised that Huangfu Yan would come. Aside from his title as ‘Prince Yan,’ he was famous for having no brains. He was a barbarian who would make a move when he was unhappy. Even if he was punished, he would continue with his barbaric acts once his punishment ended.

“What are you guys trying to do?” Chen Ling stood up when he saw Huangfu Yan approaching the Great Profound Palace with a group of people. He was first baffled, but his face soon changed when he thought of something.

A hundred thousand contribution points might be an astronomical sum for others, but it was nothing for Huangfu Yan. He could easily gather enough as long as he paid some price. If he remembered correctly, those on the Earth Ranking had already entered the Great Profound Palace once, and entering a second time was a plain waste unless they were at a bottleneck.

So Chen Ling wondered if Huangfu Yan wanted to enter the Great Profound Palace to beat up Lin Yun. The corner of Chen Ling’s lips twitched when he thought about it. No one would pay a hundred thousand contribution points just to beat Lin Yun up, but it was hard to say for Huangfu Yan.

“Who are you to poke your nose into my matter? Get lost!” Huangfu Yan glared at Chen Ling before he raised his hand and shoved him away, and the incredible power behind his palm easily sent Chen Ling flying.

“Haha!” Huangfu Yan sneered and strode forth. How could he possibly stop here because of Chen Ling? It took him a lot of effort to gather a hundred thousand contribution points.

“I heard you want to try and make it into the top ten on the Earth Ranking? You must be dreaming with this little strength. Get out of my sight now!” Huangfu Yan snorted.

Chen Ling’s face changed before he snorted. Huangfu Yan was really tyrannical, but he was also strong. His casual palm was equivalent to 40% of Chen Ling’s strength, proving that those in the top ten on the Earth Ranking weren’t pushovers. But there was no way Chen Ling would let Huangfu Yan enter the Great Profound Palace so easily!

“What if I don’t?” Chen Ling said just when Huangfu Yan was about to step forth. If Huangfu Yan entered, beating up Lin Yun was nothing. But this meant Lin Yun would waste the opportunity to comprehend the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra, and it would be troublesome if anything terrible happened.

“What are you trying to do here?” A smile appeared on Huangfu Yan’s lips as he coldly said, “You want to get in my way? Haha! Disciples of the Divine Firmament Peak are getting more and more arrogant. Do you think that I’ll think highly of you after you reached the three-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm? Let me tell you, you’re nothing!”

The boundless sea of clouds behind Huangfu Yan dissolved and formed into a massive sword aura. When Huangfu Yan and Chen Ling’s sword auras clashed, Chen Ling staggered and took several steps back, blood dripping down his lips. Chen Ling squinted his eyes as he gritted his teeth, “Transformation of the clouds!”

They weren’t on the same level when Huangfu Yan used the Azure Firmament Sword Sutra. As the sea of clouds rolled behind Huangfu Yan, he pushed his palm forth. “You want to fight me? Go and cultivate another six months. But I should be at the four-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm by then. So you’re still nothing in my eyes!” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Chen Ling’s sword aura immediately collapsed and he was sent flying away. Huangfu Yan was simply too strong, and the Azure Firmament Sword Sutra was much stronger than the sect's other ghost spirit martial techniques. They might both be at the three-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm, but they weren’t on the same level.

But just when Chen Ling was about to fall to the ground, a figure came out of the Great Profound Palace and streaked over to help Chen Lin. That person easily waved his hand to dissipate the remaining sword aura behind Huangfu Yan’s palm.

When they both landed firmly on the ground, Chen Ling rejoiced when he saw that it was Lin Yun. But he then exclaimed, “Senior Brother Lin, go back to the Divine Firmament Peak! This place isn’t safe, and Huangfu Yan is here for you.”

Huangfu Yan? One of the top ten on the Earth Ranking? Lin Yun had never seen Huangfu Yan before, but he had some impression of this person when he looked at the Earth Ranking.

“Flower Burial, you’re here at the right time!” Huangfu Yan’s eyes lit up as he looked at Lin Yun with a playful smile, “You just saved me a hundred thousand contribution points. Are you interested in playing? I’ve long heard of you!”
