Chapter 1983 - Dance (2)

“Do you have erhu?”

“I don’t have one. It’s too difficult and impossible to master without a mentor.”

“Me too, what should we do?”

“Junior Brother Ye needs an erhu!” The female disciples were anxious as they looked at Ye Qingtian dodging in mid-air. They couldn’t help feeling heartache while looking at Ye Qingtian. But the erhu had reappeared not too long ago, and few people owned one aside of those musical clans.

“No one has one?” The corner of Lin Yun’s lips twitched, and he couldn’t help feeling embarrassed. He quickly lowered himself and narrowly dodged an incoming soundwave. When he lowered his head, the moon was reflected in the lake created by Nie Wushuang, and the moon looked like it was going to fly out.

“You know how to play erhu?” A Divine Dao Pavilion’s disciple mocked. He naturally didn’t believe what Ye Qingtian said.

“Ye Qingtian, stop trying to show off and surrender!” Nie Wushuang laughed, and he increased his speed of playing the erhu.

Right then, an erhu suddenly flew towards Lin Yun. When Lin Yun grabbed it, he turned around and saw Bai Shuying.

Bai Shuying said indifferently, “Use mine.”

Lin Yun was surprised because he didn’t expect Bai Shuying to help him. He was calm now that there was an erhu in his hand. But he couldn’t be bothered about that for now, and smiled, “Thanks for lending it to me.”

This scene nearly drove Nie Wushuang insane with jealousy, and he roared, “Someone like you playing the erhu? Get lost!”

The moon broke out from the lake, and the unleashed shockwave made many people exclaim. There was a destructive aura, wanting to destroy the entire world with sadness and anger.

This instantly surprised all the Heavenly Dao Sect’s disciples because they had never imagined that the erhu was so powerful. Even from so far away, the sorrowful tune of the erhu had affected their emotions, and some even broke down crying on the ground.

“How the hell did he manage to do this?” Wang Yue wiped the tears off his cheeks. His face was filled with disbelief because he had previously interacted with musicians. But he had never experienced having his emotions affected, and this made him feel a chill run down his spine, compared to the terrifying aura of Nie Wushuang’s music.

He began to worry if Ye Qingtian could hold his own as he looked at the moon soaring from the lake, charging at Lin Yun.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

But compared to the panic on everyone’s faces, Lin Yun wasn’t afraid and even wanted to laugh, “I’m not worthy of playing the erhu?”

Was Nie Wushuang worthy, then? Lin Yun drew the bow when the bright moon was about to fall on him. He played a piece of cheerful music, which swept the sorrowful tune played by Nie Wushuang.

This was the second erhu score he played, Horse Racing!

Under his music, the sorrowful tune played by Nie Wushuang was rapidly disappearing, and the destructive aura also disappeared. The bright moon had disappeared before it could even reach Lin Yun, and it became a breeze that blew over him.

As Lin Yun’s hair fluttered in the wind, he smiled brightly, shocking everyone. Everyone was tearing up earlier, but they suddenly felt joy in their hearts and couldn’t help feeling relaxed. The sadness in their hearts disappeared, replaced with a smile on their faces that was simply unbelievable.

Nie Wushuang was dumbfounded by this scene, with his mouth wide open. Who the hell could tell him what was going on?

“You really know how to play the erhu!” Lin Yun’s performance shattered Nie Wushuang’s pride, and his eyes bulged.

“I happen to know a little,” Lin Yun smiled, increasing his speed and playing a cheerful melody. When Lin Yun played the music, everyone felt like they were in a grassland with horses galloping around, and they could hear waves of laughter around them.

Everyone was affected by this emotion, and they couldn’t help smiling in real life.

This instantly made Nie Wushuang panic, and he tried to create the phenomenon of the Moon Reflected on the Erquan Spring again. But things didn't go as he expected.

Lin Yun’s melody was cheerful, and he relaxed as he played it. He even deliberately showed off his skills by increasing his speed at certain parts.

On the other hand, Nie Wushuang felt that the bow in his hand was heavy and difficult for him to play. His face became red, and he could only play half a note. The sadness in his heart had reached the limit because the grievance he felt wasn’t fake.

But when he raised his head to look at Lin Yun wearing a smile and playing such a cheerful melody, he couldn’t get into the sorrowful mood, no matter how he tried.

Let’s not mention the Moon Reflected on the Erquan Spring, but he couldn’t even play the erhu, which made his face bitter. Everyone around him was laughing, and he was the only one who wanted to cry.

A brief moment later, his erhu left his hand as he was sent flying back by the soundwave, throwing out a mouthful of blood.

Looking at this scene, Lin Yun wore his signature smile and cockily said, “Consider it your win if you can get within ten steps of me!”

“You’re pushing it!” Nie Wushuang became furious as he charged at Lin Yun.

“Hahaha! Great!” Lin Yun laughed because this was going according to his plan. When Nie Wushuang was about ten steps away from him, he was blocked out by an invisible sound barrier. This made Nie Wushuang’s face change when he landed on the ground, and he instantly understood what Ye Qingtian was trying to do. Ye Qingtian wanted him to humiliate him, just like how he humiliated others!

Ye Qingtian was previously affected by Nie Wushuang’s music and took several blows because of his emotions. When Nie Wushuang raised his head, his heart sank when he saw the smile on Ye Qingtian’s face and wanted to retreat.

“As a heavenly song, we naturally need someone to dance with the music!” Lin Yun laughed, and his melody became even more cheerful, instantly drawing Nie Wushuang into his music.

This made Nie Wushuang lose control of his body, and he began to dance on the spot. His body swayed, and he was really dancing to the music. If his facial expression wasn’t even uglier than crying, it might be a perfect dance with the song.

When everyone saw Nie Wushuang making a joke out of himself, they laughed even louder.

“Senior Brother Nie!” The Divine Dao Pavilion’s disciples lowered their heads in shame. They gritted their teeth with determined looks because they couldn’t let Nie Wushuang embarrass himself any longer.

A few of them dashed forth, wanting to grab Nie Wushuang and bring him back. But they were horrified to find out that they were also drawn into the music. Before they could regret it, Lin Yun’s laughter resounded once more, “Everyone, let’s dance together!”
