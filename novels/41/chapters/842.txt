Chapter 843 - Leaving Along with the Wind

As Zhao Wuji and Yu Haotian left, the others also gradually woke from their cultivation. Lin Yun looked around to find Yue Weiwei, but she was nowhere to be found. He assumed that she was at the last mountain.

Retracting his gaze, Lin Yun turned to look at Mu Han, Bai Lixuan, Jiang Ziye, and the others who were getting back on their feet. Due to the boost in their strength, they couldn’t contain their aura well. There was no question that their harvest wasn't any less than Yu Haotian and Zhao Wuji.

On the other hand, Lin Yun comprehended two martial intents, which brought a drastic transformation to his Azure Dragon Sword Aura. His harvest was a lot higher than everyone else because he refined nearly 100 Divine Radiantlight Stone fragments.

Zhao Wuji only refined ten of them. How could he compare to Lin Yun? Lin Yun comprehended two different intents under six hours, which was a heaven-defying achievement. No one would believe it if he told them about it as it was enough to topple everyone’s knowledge.

“You ran into trouble in the core region?” asked Jiang Ziye. Seeing that Lin Yun didn’t have a change in his aura, Jiang Ziye and the others thought he had no harvest in the core region. After all, no one could control their aura so quickly especially when their strength had undergone a huge transformation.

Wu Xiaotian comforted him, “Don’t worry too much about it. There’s still one mountain left. Zhao Wuji won’t be able to stay arrogant for too long.”

Wu Xiaotian had refined a few fragments of lightning attribute, which increased the lightning intent gathered in his demonic aura to a shocking height. If he executed his strongest attack now, he could easily manifest nine dragons.

“That’s right. Zhao Wuji is probably unconvinced by his loss to you,” said Mu Han and Nangong Wanyu as they came over.

Lin Yun was stunned when he heard everyone’s words, but he didn’t say anything. He knew that they wouldn’t believe him if he told them what happened. Plus, Lin Yun wasn’t afraid of Zhao Wuji. He could easily kill Zhao Wuji with a slap. He even felt like doing so because he was getting annoyed by Zhao Wuji.

“There’s no more dao left in the core region, but there are some Divine Radiantlight Stone fragments left. If you guys aren’t in a hurry, I can help you guys.” Lin Yun looked at the remaining crowd carefully. They had no improvement in their strength because they either couldn’t seize any fragments or their fragments were taken by Yu Haotian forcibly.

In the end, they could only look at Wu Xiaotian and the rest enviously. However, as soon as they were losing hope, Lin Yun gave them renewed hope.

Lin Yun directed his gaze over and said, “Lixuan, Nangong, and Mu Han, you guys come with me.”

All that was left in the center region was the pole because Lin Yun had refined most of the dao. So the pressure wasn’t the same as before.

“Alright.” They naturally wouldn’t reject Lin Yun’s request.

“It’s enough for you guys to use your sword intent,” said Lin Yun as he unleashed his spiritual sword intent. But even so, the sword ray he shot out with a tap of his finger was shocking. It was nearly 30 meters wide and was enveloped in starlight, which easily sliced through the pressure.

Compared to Lin Yun’s sword ray, the others released very dim sword rays. This left Bai Lixuan, Nangong Wanyu, and Mu Han shocked. Even if Lin Yun had no harvest, his spiritual sword intent alone was enough to suppress everyone. When they thought about it, Zhao Wuji was truly naive.

Under the control of Lin Yun’s spiritual sword intent, the other sword rays charged forward and tore apart the quagmire surrounding the core region. Because they were using their sword intent, they were easily able to break through the pressure. If it was any other martial intent, it would be impossible to break through the pressure.

When the quagmire shattered, hundreds of Divine Radiantlight Stone fragments flew out and emitted a bright radiance that dazzled many people.

“Oh my god!”

“There are so many…” Everyone’s faces changed. They didn’t expect there to be so many fragments. Even Nangong Wanyu and the others were tempted when they saw the fragments.

“Young Master Lin, c-can we really have them?” All of them looked at Lin Yun with disbelief.

“Sure,” replied Lin Yun. He had already taken the fragments of lightning and wind attributes. He didn’t need the rest, so it wouldn’t hurt him to give them away. Furthermore, he had already benefited a lot. He would leave the Ancient Southern Domain and Profound Amber Realm sooner or later, so he didn’t mind leaving behind good karma for the Sword Firmament Pavilion.

“Hehe, then I won’t be polite, Big Brother Lin.” Mu Han chuckled and charged first. When the others saw this scene, they no longer hesitated. They thanked Lin Yun and dashed forward as well. It didn’t take long for all the fragments to be taken. Everyone received at least two to three fragments, leaving only the flag pole behind. A few people hesitated before they charged towards the pole.

“Don’t touch the pole.” Lin Yun quickly spoke when he saw someone go for the pole. However, he was ultimately too slow and those who got close to the pole were sent flying. Fortunately, they were sent out of the Dragoncloud Treasury when they died. Once this happened, everyone calmed down.

“Weird, where’s the flag?” asked Mu Han. Everyone noticed the missing flag and were under the impression that Lin Yun took it. But when Lin Yun asked them not to touch the pole, they realized that the dao artifact wasn’t something they could mess with. Otherwise, Lin Yun wouldn’t take the flag and leave the pole.

Lin Yun smiled bitterly because he really didn’t want to answer them. He thought his heart would bleed out if he thought about it. After all, no one could bear the fact that a dao artifact flew away from their hands.

“Let’s go.” Lin Yun took the lead and headed for the highest mountain. The others looked at the pole with reluctance before they followed behind him.

When they stepped into the pressure of the new mountain, several people started to glow and were swept away. When Lin Yun landed, he instantly knew what was going on. Those people must have been sent away.

As they travelled through the mountain, Lin Yun felt immense pressure with every step he took. It seemed like the mountain was rejecting him. At this moment, several rays of light streaked across the horizon as other people were sent out of the Dragoncloud Treasury.

“Looks like it won’t be easy.” Lin Yun’s face changed when he saw this scene. He didn’t even see the fortune martial technique before the test started, yet so many people were sent out.

Fifteen minutes later, Lin Yun realized that he couldn’t take any more steps. Now, he had to open a path with his spiritual sword intent. When he enveloped himself with spiritual sword intent, he had an easier time.

Four hours later, there was nothing aside from grass, flowers, trees, and rocks.

“Did I miss something?” Lin Yun stopped on the spot and fell into deep thoughts. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Suddenly, footsteps sounded out. When he turned around, he saw Zhu Qingshan coming up.

“Did you find anything?” Lin Yun asked because they didn’t have any grudges.

“Nothing.” Zhu Qingshan shook his head and turned to look at the mountain peak hidden in the clouds. “Perhaps only those who reach the peak will know.”

“It won’t be easy with our strength.” In Lin Yun’s view, it was practically impossible to reach the peak. However, he knew that there was a reason for this mountain. After all, the Dragoncloud Treasury wouldn’t make them leave without any harvest. According to Lin Yun’s speculation, if there was really a fortune martial technique, it was hidden along the way. Perhaps he missed something from earlier?

Lin Yun shocked Zhu Qingshan when he shared his speculation with the latter. Even Lin Yun can’t reach the peak? Zhu Qingshan was shocked because he thought that Lin Yun could reach the top.

The two fell into a brief silence before Lin Yun called out just as they were about to separate, “Zhu Qingshan, is there a need to wear a mask before me?”

Zhu Qingshan was stunned for a long time before he smiled bitterly and removed his mask.

“When did you realize it?” After removing his mask, Zhu Qingshan revealed a familiar face. He was the Great Qin Empire’s Zuo Yun.

“Just a moment ago.” To be honest, Lin Yun was just guessing. After all, there were no similarities between Zhu Qingshan and Zuo Yun. But for some reason, he could sense a familiar feeling from Zhu Qingshan. But Lin Yun didn’t press for an explanation because Zuo Yun must have his reasons for hiding his identity.

“Be careful. I won’t tell the others about your identity.”

“Thank you.” After sending Zuo Yun off, Lin Yun wasn’t feeling troubled. After all, righteous and demonic martial techniques had no meaning to him because all that mattered was who used the techniques.

A while later, Lin Yun still had no harvest. However, his mood didn’t turn nasty because his journey had turned into a stroll. As the wind blew, Lin Yun casually held onto a fallen leaf and began to toss it away.

“Hmmm?” Lin Yun was surprised because he could sense sword intent in the leaf. But where did the wind come from that blew the leaf down?

Suddenly, Lin Yun smiled and flicked the leaf away. When the leaf flew, it silently sliced a rock into two.
