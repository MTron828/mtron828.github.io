Chapter 849 - Heavenly Path, Myriad Realms Competition

Lin Yun had used his performance to show that anyone below him was an ant. Yu Haotian and Zhao Wuji deserved it after provoking him numerous times and calling him an ant multiple times.

But there was also a reason why they were so arrogant. They thought that Lin Yun’s spiritual sword intent wasn’t effective against them. However, Lin Yun ended up showing them once more that he stood high above them. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The wind blew for a long time as everyone looked at Lin Yun dumbfoundedly. What could they say? A moment ago, they thought that Lin Yun had gone insane. They thought there was no way he could defeat Yu Haotian and Zhao Wuji in three moves.

However, Lin Yun kept his word and defeated Zhao Wuji with one move and defeated Yu Haotian with one glance. Before the banquet, Yu Haotian was a legendary figure in the Ancient Southern Domain. But now, not only did he kneel before Lin Yun, he also had a hole in his chest created by Lin Yun.

At this moment, no one knew if Yu Haotian would live. His life depended on the Indigomoon Elysium and their ability. Lin Yun also ended up humiliating the Indigomoon Elysium and the Violet Thunder Sect.

“Quick, save him!” The Violet Thunder Sect and Indigomoon Elysium moved to save Zhao Wuji and Yu Haotian. However, their faces became terrifyingly dark when they examined the wounds.

The injuries were simply too disastrous, especially for Zhao Wuji. They initially thought that Zhao Wuji’s injuries wouldn’t be as serious as Yu Haotian’s injuries, but they were shocked to discover that all of Zhao Wuji’s bones and internal organs were shattered. He was barely hanging on.

As for Yu Haotian, his injury was clearly severe since he had a hole in his chest. However, since it was Yu Haotian, he was still able to breathe. If it was someone else, they would be dead.

“Bastard, I’ll kill you!” The Indigomoon Elysium’s sect master fed a pellet to Yu Haotian before he flew into rage.

“Get lost!” But before the sect master could get up, the chief judge simply raised his hand to suppress the sect master. At this moment, everyone could sense the immense pressure coming from the chief judge. They were shocked that the amicable judge had such a terrifying cultivation despite being so tolerant to geniuses like Yu Haotian.

Then, the chief judge pushed his palm out, causing the Indigomoon Elysium’s sect master to throw up blood.

“Empyrean…” Lin Yun was shocked to discover that this chief judge was an empyrean.

The chief judge looked around and coldly said, “Yu Haotian and Zhao Wuji were asking for it. I won’t interfere in the affairs between juniors, but if any sect thinks that they can bully a genius on the ranking, they will feel my wrath!”

The face of the Indigomoon Elysium’s sect master became nasty because he had basically been slapped. However, the Indigomoon Elysium’s sect master became silent because he didn’t dare to have any other thoughts.

“Now then, Lin Yun and the top ten, please step forward.” The chief judge resumed his announcement after settling the affairs. “Yan Long’zi is dead and there’s one slot left in the top ten. The Sacred Alliance has decided that Nangong Wanyu will be promoted.”

When the chief judge made the announcement, everyone from the Northern Snow Manor rejoiced. Even Nangong Wanyu was shocked because he never imagined that he would make it into the top ten. Then again, it was fair and no other geniuses could say a word about it. After all, Nangong Wanyu was worthy of being in the top ten with his strength.

“Thank you, Senior.” Nangong Wanyu stepped forward with joy on his face.

“This banquet has officially come to an end. Seven days from now, the Dragoncloud Ranking will officially be announced. As for the ten of you, come with me…” The chief judge clearly had special words for the top ten. After a brief pause, he looked at the Indigomoon Elysium and Violet Thunder Sect and spoke coldly, “Since Zhao Wuji and Yu Haotian aren’t dead, I’ll send someone later to explain things. However, if they die, someone else will take their place.”

When he said that, the elders from the two overlord forces felt humiliated. On the other hand, the geniuses of the top 100 found the Indigomoon Elysium and VIolet Thunder Sect to be pitiful.

When the chief judge left with the top ten, the banquet came to an end. However, the spectators didn’t leave.

“Is it over? This banquet was unbelievable. Lin Yun actually became the champion.”

“He easily suppressed the other kings.”

“There are no other rewards for the top ten, only fortune. Fortune might not be visible, but it really exists. This is why everyone’s harvest in the treasury wasn’t comparable to Lin Yun. Yu Haotian and Zhao Wuji are still too young. Since Lin Yun became the champion, there was no way they could compete against Lin Yun in terms of fortune.

“I wonder why the top ten were called on. There has been some news that the Heavenly Path will be opened with the new era. Perhaps this is why they left.” Everyone began to discuss the reason, but they had no clue why the top ten were called on.

It was true that the last six months had rumors that a new era was coming. The overlord forces were spreading rumors about the new era that was a gateway to the bigger world. As for the Heavenly Path, no one had an idea what it was about, but they guessed that it was the reason why the Sacred Alliance called for the top ten.

On a mountain outside Dragoncloud City stood a bewitching woman. If Lin Yun saw this woman, he would instantly recognize her as Xin Yan from the Sword Firmament Pavilion.

There was another bewitching woman beside her, but the atmosphere this lady gave was terrifyingly cold. The weird thing about her was that no one else could see her existence aside from Xin Yan. It was as though she didn’t exist in this world.

“Since I’ve fulfilled my promise, it’s time for you to leave with me,” said the woman indifferently as she looked at Xin Yan with gentleness in her eyes. Xin Yan was the successor that she traveled through countless worlds looking for.

“Master, where is he going?” Xin Yan asked with reluctance in her voice.

“To where he belongs. No genius can avoid the arrival of the new era, even in the lower realms. He’s the same as you and I. He has his own path and you have yours,” said the woman.

“Is it destined that our paths will never cross?” Xin Yan asked bitterly.

The woman sighed and remained silent for a long time before she replied, “You were born charming and possess Aquamoon. You won’t be able to escape the calamity even if you hide yourself. You have no choice but to leave with me. As for him…the path he’s walking is a path towards heaven. It’s an endless battlefield, and it’s unknown if he can even survive. It’s time for us to leave now…”

Knowing that Xin Yan was reluctant, the woman had no choice but to take Xin Yan away forcibly. Xin Yan didn’t struggle and ended up turning away in reluctance with a tear rolling down her cheek. This would be the last tear she shed in this world and she had no idea if she would ever see Lin Yun again.

In the Dragoncloud City, the chief judge led the geniuses to an ancient altar. The altar was engraved with mysterious dragon runes and the judges were performing an ancient ceremony around it. The last step of the ceremony involved placing wooden plates with the names of the geniuses on the altar.

“Dragon breath!” Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts because he could sense that the flame on the altar was similar to the Azure Dragon breath he had refined. However, the dragon aura contained in the altar’s dragon breath was pure, so there was no way his dragon breath could compare.

Mu Han, Nangong Wanyu, Wu Xiaotian, and the others felt uneasy under this solemn ceremony. At this moment, Lin Yun could sense strands of essence drifting out of Dragoncloud City. It was as though the names of the geniuses would be sent to an ancient existence in the Profound Amber Realm.

“The new era is arriving and the Heavenly Path is opening. I bet you guys have heard this before, right? Everyone in the top ten will be qualified to participate in this opportunity,” said the chief judge in a solemn voice. “However, it’s limited to the top ten. Those who want to ascend the Heavenly Path will have to get through the Profound Amber Mountain’s test and compete for the quota with geniuses of the other domains. Even geniuses from the bigger world are envious of the Heavenly Path, but it’s not an easy path and you can die at any time. Countless realms will be competing for the Heavenly Path!”

The faces of Mu Han, Bai Lixuan, and the others changed when they heard that. They couldn’t even conceal the shock and surprise in their eyes.
