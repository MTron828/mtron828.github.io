Chapter 568 - My Sword, Cold Like Blood

Two decades ago, Liu Yunyan’s father thoroughly lost in Hell Mode and made the academy suffer humiliation. It was so bad that not even their elders could raise their heads. This was the reason why Liu Yunyan had been under great pressure all along. But now, someone from the academy was going to challenge Hell Mode once more?

The elderly judge appeared before Lin Yun. He could keep himself composed with how experienced he was. He looked at Lin Yun and asked, “Do you know the rules of Hell Mode?”

Lin Yun nodded his head as he naturally knew about it. Hell Mode for this was different from the Dragon Gate Competition as the challenger had to face three participants from the White Jade Academy at once. Not only that, but the Flowing Cloud Academy and Azurefoot Academy could also send out a single participant.

This meant that the challenger had to face five opponents at the same time, which was a lot more brutal than the Dragon Gate Competition. But the decision didn’t lie with Lin Yun, but the Heavenly Province Academy.

Two decades ago, the Heavenly Province Academy paid the price of a lesser divine ability, a hundred fourth grade pellets, ten fifth grade pellets, and an astronomical sum of spiritual jades. This choice simply made no sense to anyone. Furthermore, even if Lin Yun won, he still had to face Cao Zhen.

Cao Zhen’s cultivation already entered the lesser Yang stage a year ago, so there was a possibility that he had reached the greater Yang stage. After all, he was a monstrous genius groomed by the Northern Snow Manor for the Draconic Banquet. The Five Academies Competition was just a stepping stone for him.

The Violethut Academy invited him over as a safeguard as they had to finish the promise they made two decades ago by obtaining the incomplete divine rune. There wasn’t anyone Cao Zhen’s age in the Nether Prefectural City that could surpass him.

The faces of the Heavenly Province Academy’s elders changed. Not mentioning Cao Zhen, but they weren’t optimistic of Lin Yun completing Hell Mode. After all, there was a high possibility that Lin Yun would be killed before he could even admit defeat.

The White Jade Academy would probably try and kill Lin Yun in Hell Mode because they were so brutal. However, while everyone hesitated, Lin Yun turned around and unleashed his aura. Right at this moment, he was like a sword waiting to be drawn. After all, there was nothing he could do if no one drew him.

He didn’t say a word as he looked at Tang Yu with confidence in his eyes. His gaze made Tang Yu’s heart tremble and made Yu Mu feel like she was suffocating.

Mo Ling’s eyes flashed as she spoke out, “Agree to him. I ask of Senior Tang with my position as a direct descendant of the Mo Clan to agree with him. If he loses, I’m willing to bear the consequences with him.”

The other elders were surprised by Mo Ling’s words because it was the same as being a guarantor for Lin Yun.

Tang Yu glanced at Mo Ling before he turned to look at Lin Yun, “The Heavenly Province Academy doesn’t have any objection.”

His words instantly caused a commotion among the spectators. The Heavenly Province Academy actually agreed to Hell Mode.

“Holy shit, they actually agreed.”

“Looks like the Heavenly Province Academy is going to accompany Lin Yun’s insanity.”

“Was their loss two decades ago not enough?”

This decision left the three other academies shocked because they hadn’t treated Lin Yun’s words seriously. After all, the Heavenly Province Academy had to pay the price if Lin Yun lost.

“What arrogance. Since the Heavenly Province Academy wants to give us a fat gift, then we’ll take it.” Luo Shen and Cao Xiu both jumped onto the stage.

When the judge looked at the Flowing Cloud Academy’s direction, a figure also soared out. It was Bai Yuchen, the Flowing Cloud Academy’s helper. There was no way they could let go of such an opportunity when they could take a piece of pie from the Heavenly Province Academy.

The judge then turned to look at the Azurefoot Academy, but Jiang Yi persuaded the team not to join.

When Lin Yun raised his head and Jiang Yi smiled in his direction. He was filled with admiration for Lin Yun, so this was the best he could do to help Lin Yun. Although he might admire Lin Yun’s courage, he wasn’t optimistic that Lin Yun could defeat his opponent.

With Chen Yu, Luo Shen, Cao Xiu, and Bai Yuchen standing on the stage, the atmosphere suddenly became nervous as no one dared to utter a word. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“I hereby announce the beginning of Hell Mode!” The judge grabbed onto Liu Yunyan and left the stage, leaving the stage to the five participants. There was no question that this would be a brutal fight.

Four powerful auras exploded and a violent gale was created. Lin Yun raised his head to look at Luo Shen and Chen Yu with fighting spirit blazing in his eyes.

Luo Shen smiled coldly as he looked at Lin Yun, “That little lady who was chopped by me must be feeling terrible right now. But you don’t have to worry about it because you’ll soon be severed into two by my sword. You won’t feel any pain. I can also grant you another way of dying if you wish.”

Chen Yu held onto his fan and smirked, “Death? That’ll be too easy for him. We should have some fun with him for challenging Hell Mode.”

“You guys should worry about yourselves instead,” said Lin Yun seriously.

“What arrogance!” The four participants’ faces changed. They all had a high status back in their own academies and sects, so they didn’t think that Lin Yun was stronger than them.

“Flower Burial Lin Yun, is here to fight.” Lin Yun’s eyes suddenly became cold. The Flower Burial Sword also began to tremble lightly after sensing the killing aura in Lin Yun’s heart.

Before the four of them could make their moves, Lin Yun was already charging over.

“Interesting…”

“Are you courting death that much?” Looking at Lin Yun rushing over, the four participants wore a sneer on their faces.

But in the next second, the smiles on their faces froze as an Iris Flower appeared above Lin Yun.

In the name of my sword, bloom!

A domineering sword aura exploded from Lin Yun, making him look like a lofty mountain in the eyes of others. In the next second, Lin Yun executed his movement technique and disappeared, which made the four participants’ faces change and the atmosphere tense.

With a sword buzz ringing out, a silvery sword ray appeared behind Bai Yuchen without any warning. Bai Yuchen didn’t think too much about it and drew his sword to face it head-on. But the moment it clashed with his sword, Bai Yuchen was sent flying and blood dripped down from his palm.

“How is this possible!” Bai Yuchen was shocked that Lin Yun’s origin energy was actually stronger than his despite the difference in their cultivation. In addition to Lin Yun’s xiantian sword intent, the power of their attacks was also vastly different.

Knocking Bai Yuchen away, Lin Yun stabbed his sword backwards. His face remained aloof as a sword ray shot out.

“Damn it!” Lin Yun’s sword startled Cao Xiu as he quickly retreated.

Chen Yu’s eyes were grim as he charged towards Lin Yun’s rear with his fan. However, Lin Yun was agile like a dancing butterfly as he turned around and swung his sword out, catching Chen Yu by surprise and suppressing the latter.

Chen Yu’s face sank as spiritual runes began to appear on his fan that unfolded out like a painting to block Lin Yun’s attack. However, Chen Yu placed too much hope in himself.

Lin Yun’s sword was like a breeze as it blew through Chen Yu’s guard and shot down at him. Facing Lin Yun’s attack, Chen Yu could only gnash his teeth as he kept retreating. When he retreated ten steps, Lin Yun suddenly increased the strength behind his sword and sent Chen Yu flying.

But right at this moment, the ground suddenly began to tremble as Luo Shen was about to make his move. His greatsword smashed into the ground like a mountain, which made many people’s faces change. They all knew that there was something unusual about Luo Shen’s sword technique. If Lin Yun couldn’t take Luo Shen’s first strike, then he would definitely lose just like Mu Xue had.

But just when Luo Shen was about to grab onto his greatsword, Lin Yun suddenly turned around and dashed towards Luo Shen like a silver ray.

“Great!” Luo Shen’s eyes surged with killing aura as he wore a sinister smile.

But his smile soon froze as the Flower Burial Sword chopped off his right arm. No one could see how Lin Yun attacked. They only saw a silver ray flashing out when Luo Shen was about to grab onto his greatsword.

Luo Shen howled in pain, but he bore the pain and reached out with his left hand towards his greatsword.

But there was no way Lin Yun would give him the opportunity to grab his sword. Lin Yun swung out his sword and sent Luo Shen’s left arm flying as well.

When Lin Yun turned around, a silver ray shot out. When he turned back around, there was a decapitated head flying into the sky behind him.
