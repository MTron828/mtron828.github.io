Chapter 819 - Heaven and Earth Union

“Lin Yun wins!” The judge announced the outcome indifferently as he looked at Wu Xiaotian. Since Wu Xiaotian’s attack crumbled, it would be a waste of time for the battle to carry on.

The judge knew that Lin Yun didn’t really defeat Wu Xiaotian with just a glance as there were many insights behind Lin Yn’s attack. Without a terrifying accumulation of energy and intent, it was impossible to send Wu Xiaotian flying with just a glance. There was also the difference between the crimson dragons and the azure dragon.

After all, even a genuine crimson dragon was nothing before an azure dragon. Lin Yun’s fight was too shocking. Initially, the crowd was shocked that Zhao Wuji could defeat Bai Lixuan with one snap. But now, they were shocked that Lin Yun defeated Wu Xiaotian with a glance. If they didn’t consider the difference between Bai Lixuan and Wu Xiaotian, Lin Yun’s method was a lot stronger than Zhao Wuji’s method.

After the announcement was made, Wu Xiaotian’s profound amber aura flew towards Lin Yun. However, since Wu Xiaotian already lost before, Lin Yun’s dragon projection didn’t grow a fourth claw.

The silence of the crowd was finally broken after a few people realized what had happened.

“This is too terrifying. Just what the hell was that? How did he defeat Wu Xiaotian with just a glance?”

“They’re not on the same level. Lin Yun didn’t even draw his sword. I can’t imagine how powerful he will become when he draws his sword.”

“He truly is the strongest dark horse.”

In the Violet Thunder Sect’s section, a disciple looked at Zhao Wuji and asked, “Senior brother, how did Lin Yun manage to do it? Can it be that he held back when he faced Nangong Wanyu?”

“They’re not on the same level and he naturally hid his strength when he faced Nangong Wanyu. Among all of the dark horses, he’s the only one I can’t see through.” Zhao Wuji, who defeated Bai Lixuan with a snap, was more cautious when he spoke about Lin Yun. After all, someone like Lin Yun was harder to deal with than the others.

Another disciple asked, “You can’t see through him? But he already revealed most of his trump cards, his cultivation, sword technique, body-refining technique, and cultivation technique.”

Lin Yun had revealed a lot of his trump cards today, unlike the three kings who still held onto theirs.

Zhao Wuji replied, “Seeing through someone doesn’t mean seeing through their trump cards. Even if Lin Yun doesn’t have any trump cards left, I still can’t see through him. What I mean is understanding each of his attacks. If I can see through him, I could confidently deal with him. However, I can’t see through him and even feel a little fear from him. This is something that I’ve never felt in the past.” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Although Zhao Wuji said these words, he didn’t show any uneasiness or solemnness. Instead, his eyes were filled with excitement. After all, only a strong opponent could bring him satisfaction. He was confident that he could defeat all of his opponents and he really wanted to defeat Lin Yun before fighting Yu Haotian. If he beat Lin Yun first, he had a higher chance of defeating Yu Haotian.

The shock caused by this battle was great, especially since Lin Yun brought out his Azure Dragon Sword Aura. He forced the three kings to examine him deeply and to take him seriously.

After his battle, Lin Yun left the stage and ignored the surrounding gazes. The commotion caused by his Azure Dragon Sword Aura was within his expectation, so he wasn’t afraid to reveal it. After all, it wasn’t perfect and he still had to temper it through battles. If anyone could see the flaw in his Azure Dragon Sword Aura, it would help him perfect it and grasp the complete version sooner.

Then, the judge announced the next battle between Yu Haotian and Jiang Ziye. Yu Haotian was a true genius who participated in the previous banquet when he was only sixteen. There were even rumours that he barely used half of his strength to defeat the remaining two kings and seven elites. Four years ago, his performance as a dark horse was even more dazzling than Lin Yun’s performance.

Yu Haotian was only twenty years old, which made him one of the younger participants. His age and strength made him the joy and pride of the Indigomooon Elysium. Given his talents, everyone thought it would be simple for him to be the champion once more. Even if the dark horses could defeat Zhao Wuji and Yan Long’zi, none of them had a chance against Yu Haotian.

The same thing went for Jiang Ziye. She was the last of the seven elites who had the best odds against the three kings. After all, there were rumours that she exchanged over a hundred moves with Yan Longzi. However, in the face of Yu Haotian, she was destined to lose. Yu Haotian had yet to suffer a single loss in both of the banquets that he participated in. He was like a towering mountain that no one could overcome.

Two rays of light flickered as Jiang Ziye and Yu Haotian arrived on the stage. At this moment, the spectators held their breaths. Yu Haotian had gone on the stage many times, but he never once met a qualified opponent like Jiang Ziye. So no one had any idea of his current strength. This was also something the others in the top ten wanted to know.

Most importantly, everyone knew that Jiang Ziye didn’t fear the three kings. Her goal was also to beat the three kings and become the champion.

“Whoever defeats you will become the champion. I’m a little surprised that I’m the first person who has to challenge you.” Jiang Ziye began to accumulate her aura as fighting spirits filled her pupils.

“That’s right. Whoever can defeat me will obtain the first!” Yu Haotian said confidently before he sneered, “However, it’s a shame that no one will do that, not Zhao Wuji, not Yan Long’zi, and certainly not you!”

Although Jiang Ziye and Yu Haotian knew each other for a long time, Yu Haotian didn’t bother giving Jiang Ziye any recognition because of his personality. However, Jiang Ziye didn’t seem bothered and replied, “There are things that you can’t see through in this world. I don’t need your interest. All I have to do is defeat you.”

“Dragoncloud Finger!” Jiang Ziye pointed her finger out and countless clouds formed a dragon around her finger. In the next second, the dragon flew towards Yu Haotian with its jaw wide open.

“Pitiful tricks.” Yu Haotian’s eyes flashed with disdain as he reached for the dragon’s neck. The dragon immediately cried out when it was grabbed and began to shrink in Yu Haotian’s hands before he tossed it away.

Simultaneously, Jiang Ziye appeared before Yu Haotian and pushed three palms forward. Each of her palms manifested into a towering mountain that caused the entire stage to tremble violently.

“Good!” Yu Haotian’s eyes flickered with interest before he barked, “Indigomoon Heart-piercing Claw!”

This was a technique that came with the Indigomoon Sutra that Qing Ruoyou used against Yue Weiwei. However, when Yu Haotian used it, it seemed entirely different. Unlike Qing Ruoyou’s version that seemed like a venomous python, his version felt ruthless.

His claw tore the mountain range apart. By the time his palm came in contact with Jiang Ziye’s, it had become a lot weaker.

Under this attack, Jiang Ziye was easily sent flying despite the attack being weakened. Yu Haotian was composed when he saw his attack lose steam, which terrified the crowd.

“Heavenly Imprisoning Finger!” Jiang Ziye decisively brought out her ultimate attack as a gigantic finger tore apart the clouds.

Looking at the finger, Yu Haotian’s face changed slightly as he made a decision in his mind. He then threw out a punch that made him seem like the ruler of the entire region. “Overlord Fist—Heaven and Earth Union!”

His punch gave off an unparalleled dominance that destroyed the finger descending from the sky. This made Jiang Ziye throw up blood as she was sent flying once again. Yu Haotian’s attack even damaged her cloud intent.

“Overlord Fist?”

“Isn’t the Overlord Fist one of the Sword Sect’s strongest martial techniques? How does Yu Haotian have it?”

“It’s not surprising when you think about it. The Indigomoon Elysium occupies the Thunder Prefecture and they were also related to the Sword Sect’s annihilation. It would make sense that they possess the Overlord Fist.”

“Wow. I wonder how it is compared to Lin Yun’s Overlord Sword.” The impactful scene made everyone think that Yu Haotian was invincible. Even Lin Yun was surprised by the punch.
