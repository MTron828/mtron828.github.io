Chapter 1243 - Bluff

Entering the Nine Li Illusion Realm once more, Lin Yun stood between the black and white armies again.

“It’s here!” When the war drums echoed out, the battle took place once more with thousands of people losing their lives every second. Everyone’s vitality was burning up in a crimson mist while cold killing aura was flashing in everyone’s eyes.

With the shouts from the battlefield, the ground began to shake. In this ocean of killing aura, Lin Yun wasn’t able to connect his sword aura and he couldn’t even circulate his astral energy properly. So he could barely bring out 10% of his strength. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Even if he had already experienced the first level once, it was still shocking. But no matter how shocked Lin Yun felt, he had to survive.

With his prior experience, Lin Yun wasn’t as careless. He knew that he had to forget about his sword intent and identity now because his sole priority should be on survival.

Without any hesitation, Lin Yun charged toward the army in black while his eyes turned bloodshot. Aside from his companions who were also donned in white, everyone else could be killed in his eyes. He would occasionally save people, but he would also leave them without any hesitation.

This time, he lasted for a long time, so his clothes ended up turning red from blood. He could clearly sense that the longer he survived, the harder the enemies would become. Although he was completely exhausted at this point, he didn’t dare to relax.

Because of this heightened state of focus, his mind was becoming numb. Lin Yun killed so many people that the ground was littered with corpses as if a violent storm had swept through.

Suddenly, Lin Yun’s eyes lit up as he saw the flag of the black army’s general. The general stood underneath the flag holding a spear in his hand. He sat on his demonic beast as he stared at Lin Yun. Lin Yun felt a chill run down his spine from the dense killing aura in the general’s pupils.

Lin Yun instantly knew that he was being targeted. But before he could do anything, a black blur flashed over and blood splattered out of Lin Yun’s throat. Then, his vision gradually got blurry. But before his vision disappeared, he saw an indifferent face with a cross-shaped scar staring at him.

Lin Yun spit up a mouthful of blood as he regained his consciousness on the altar. The flames of the altar were extinguished as Lin Yun took a pellet before wiping the blood off his lips. Then, he stood up on the altar.

He didn’t notice that when he stood up, he was shrouded in a boundless killing aura. He didn’t have any emotions on his face as he calmly analyzed his experience, “To make it through the first level, I have to defeat the general. War drums… I should be able to use my flute since I’m facing music.”

Lin Yun wasn’t anxious about his second failure. He also wasn’t in a rush to enter the illusion realm once more. The killing aura was already so dense on the first level, so he couldn’t imagine how terrifying the next few levels would be. At least the killing aura was tempering his sword intent.

The old geezer was right about the altar tempering his sword intent, willpower, and physique. If he could bring out his sword intent in the Nine Li Illusion Realm, his sword intent wouldn’t collapse anymore if he faced Dragon Pulse Realm experts in the future.

When Lin Yun thought about it, his eyes lit up. “This is truly a good place.”

Since he had plenty of divine astral pellets, the altar was the best place for him to temper himself. When flames blazed on the altar once more, Lin Yun also sank into the illusion realm.

Appearing on the battlefield once more, Lin Yun had no fluctuation on his face as his vitality and killing aura had perfectly merged with the army. He was like a droplet of water in the ocean while also being an individual. It was a bizarre feeling.

When Lin Yun saw the general’s flag of the black army, he felt the killing intent of the general once more. However, Lin Yun didn’t have any fear and looked at the general.

Suddenly, Lin Yun grabbed onto a sword with his right hand. The edge of the sword dug into his palm, but Lin Yun’s face didn’t change despite the intense pain. The man with the cross-shaped scar on his face was back. He had a shock in his eyes because he clearly didn’t expect that Lin Yun would grab his sword.

But before he could have any time to think, Lin Yun already swung his sword out and decapitated the man.

“I won’t make the same mistake again,” said Lin Yun indifferently. Then, he submerged himself in the massacre once more. Before he knew it, the sky was black.

When Lin Yun looked around, he couldn’t see any of his companions. The only thing he could see were corpses, leaving him all alone. As for the black army, they were a few thousand meters away and staring at him.

“Charge!” The army roared with their eyes turning bloodshot as creatures more terrifying than demons.

As war drums sounded out once more, the roar became even louder. Facing this, Lin Yun began to wonder if this is why the old geezer said he could lose his life. Since he was all alone now, he had to face an entire army on his own. If he couldn’t manifest his sword aura, he would be killed the moment they clashed.

At that time, he might never wake up. Thinking about it, Lin Yun tightened his grip on his sword because it was really troublesome that the Flower Burial Sword wasn’t here.

“Well, you’re basically my companion too. I’ll put my life in your hands.” Lin Yun smiled looking at the sword in his hand before he shut his eyes.

“Kill!” The general gave an order as he pointed his spear. In the next second, the ground began to tremble violently as a black wave charged over at Lin Yun. The collective sword aura of the black army began to clash with Lin Yun’s sword aura.

Although the azure dragon sword aura had faintly manifested behind him, it was constantly under impact from the killing aura. But no matter how the killing aura swept through him, Lin Yun didn’t take a single step back. Instead, he persevered by relying on his willpower.

When Lin Yun opened his eyes again, his sword aura manifested into an azure dragon. When his azure dragon sword aura was finally formed, the surging black army looked like it had collided with an iron wall. Many were sent flying away while others burst into a mist of blood and it didn’t take long for blood to start raining from the sky.

“Die!” Seeing that he had successfully manifested his sword aura, Lin Yun’s pent up anger finally exploded.

Previously, 90% of his strength had been restricted, and he could only fight as a small pawn on the battlefield. But now he could finally unleash his strength, he could let loose on the battlefield.

Just like that, Lin Yun fended off an entire army all by himself. Although the black army was charging over, they were nothing before Lin Yun who had released his azure dragon sword aura. Very quickly, the black-armored general also charged over while riding on a demonic beast before stabbing his spear at Lin Yun.

When he stabbed his spear out, the war drums reached a limit and Lin Yun’s eardrums nearly exploded. Even his heart nearly blew out of his chest. On the other hand, the black-armored general’s aura and killing aura had reached a terrifying height empowered by the war drums.

The general’s spear destroyed Lin Yun’s sword and azure dragon sword aura. Then, it hit his chest. At this moment, Lin Yun was grabbing onto the spear with both hands. Blood dripped from his lips as he ferociously stood his ground.

When the drums sounded out once more, the black-armored general’s armor continued to surge violently. It felt like the entire world was against him. With the entire world against him, would he still have the courage to swing his sword? Others might fear death, but Lin Yun only had two words for it.

“Get lost!” Lin Yun’s face twisted as he roared and got closer to the general.

Under his mask, the general’s face changed as his aura was completely suppressed by Lin Yun. At the same time, another crack appeared on the sword cocoon in Lin Yun’s forehead.

Lin Yun then chopped the spear in half and took this opportunity to swipe his fingers across the general’s neck like a sword. Just like that, the general’s head fell off.

Right at this moment, another crack appeared on the sword cocoon. As long as nine cracks appear on the sword cocoon, the divine firmament sword intent would emerge. Fortunately, Lin Yun’s sword cocoon actually cracked twice on the first level of the Nine Li Illusion Realm. It had now cracked five different times.

Outside of the illusion, a boundless sword aura exploded out of Lin Yun’s body and the purple mark on his forehead also emitted an unprecedented bewitching light.

Looking at this scene, Feng Jue was dumbfounded as he asked in a trembling voice, “H-How long did you spend to get through the first level back then?”

“Seven days, but I was at the Elysium Core Realm,” said Jian Jingtian.

“You only dared to give this a try when you’re in the Elysium Core Realm, but you brought Lin Yun here when he’s only in the Empyrean Realm. You’re really ballsy. I’m curious if you’ve gone through all nine levels of the Nine Li Illusion Realm,” said Feng Jue.

“I didn’t. I only made it through the third level. The Nine Li Illusion Realm didn’t help me anymore after I reached the Dragon Pulse Realm. So I didn’t bother continuing,” replied Jian Jingtian.

Hearing that made Feng Jue widen his mouth and his face also turned black.

Seeing this scene, Jian Jingtian smiled, “See? Isn’t that pretty effective?”

The corner of Feng Jue’s lips twitched when he heard that because he didn’t know what to say. Jian Jingtian was really good at lying and tricking Lin Yun. Lin Yun probably felt terrible after getting through the first level. After all, Jian Jingtian only made the attempt after reaching the Elysium Core Realm.
