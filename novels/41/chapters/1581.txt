Chapter 1582 - Lord Phoenix

Lin Yun’s face became dark upon hearing that. But looking at Lil’ Red, it should have learned to speak not too long ago. Rubbing Lil’ Red on the head, Lin Yun said, “You can just address me as ‘big brother’, but not ‘big brother scumbag’.”

“Okay, big brother.” Lil’ Red grinned with a cunning light flashing through its pupils.

This made Lin Yun wonder if Lil’ Red was doing this on purpose, but he couldn’t be bothered to hold it against Lil’ Red. Since he was here, he might as well practice the Sovereign Dragon Fist.

Coming before the tablet, Lin Yun looked at the Sovereign Dragon Fist recorded on it with his eyes flickering. There was something weird with this tablet; he would have new insights whenever he comprehended before the tablet.

Four fist forms were recorded on the Sovereign Dragon Fist: the Soaring Divine Dragon, Divine Dragon Order, Raging Divine Dragon, and Repentless Divine Dragon. Aside from that, the secret techniques, Divine Dragon Eyes and the Sovereign Dragon Seal were also recorded on it.

He didn’t have much time previously, so Lin Yun didn’t put much effort into studying the Sovereign Dragon Seal and Divine Dragon Eyes. Most importantly, he was previously in the Elysium Core Realm, and it wasn’t easy for him to try and learn them. But it was different now that he was in the Dragon Pulse Realm.

Standing before the stone tablet, Lin Yun sat down and circulated the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon to manipulate his dragon origin. When he circulated his dragon origin, a dragon roar echoed from the stone tablet, and the patterns on the tablet lit up. Lin Yun formed a particular connection with the stone tablet as the light flickered.

“Interesting…” Lin Yun’s eyes lit up because the stone tablet seemed capable of assisting him in cultivating. He speculated that this stone tablet might be a particular sacred item, and thousands of people could cultivate in front of it at its prime.

Then again, that was on the prerequisite that he had to be in the Dragon Pulse Realm, and he instantly knew that he was right about coming here. After he slowly closed his eyes, information appeared within his mind. It was all related to the Sovereign Dragon Seal. Condensing seven-colored divine lights with the Sovereign Dragon Seal was only at lesser mastery. If he wanted to reach greater mastery, he would have to learn seven types of divine dragon seals, the Blue Dragon Seal, White Dragon Seal, Silver Dragon Seal, Golden Dragon Seal, Cyan Dragon Seal, Indigo Dragon Seal, and Red Dragon Seal.

After the seven divine seals overlapped, he would reach greater mastery in the Sovereign Dragon Seal. If he wanted to reach complete mastery, he would have to form the Heavenly Dragon Seal. There was even the legendary Ancestral Dragon Seal above the Heavenly Dragon Seal.

The Dragon Clan’s martial techniques were profound, and he was soon immersed in the comprehension. Aside from that, the Sovereign Dragon Seal and Divine Dragon Eyes could supplement each other. Every time he managed to condense a Divine Dragon Seal, he could empower them to the Divine Dragon Eyes.

The Divine Dragon Eyes could be considered the Dragon Clan’s eye technique with a strong offensive power. When the Demonic Rune Tiger went to find information about the thousand-year ominous auras, Lin Yun started to learn the remaining seven Divine Dragon Seals. As for the Heavenly Dragon Seal, it wasn’t recorded on the stone tablet at all.

Under his manipulation, his every meridian, vitality, muscle, dragon rune, and even sword intent surged to his arms. His dragon origin, sword intent, and dragon runes combined within his arms, making his arms feel heavy as he started forming seals with his hands. Whenever he formed a seal, his vitality would be exhausted. Simultaneously, a boundless dragon aura would appear from him.

After the dragon aura overlapped ten times, Lin Yun’s vitality was incredibly exhausted and he roared, “Blue Dragon Seal!”

A profound seal formed in his right hand and radiated with blue light. When ten-odd runes overlapped, it formed into an ancient rune that looked like a Blue Dragon engraved on his palm. As the blue light spread out, it was like flames blazing on his palm.

He instantly realized that the Blue Dragon Seal was simultaneously a seal and dragon flame. But this made him feel uneasy because he wasn’t too confident. After all, the stone tablet was incomplete, and Lin Yun could only rely on his instincts and talent to comprehend it without anyone guiding him.

When he practiced the Divine Dragon Eyes, he nearly lost his eyes, making Lin Yun more cautious of the Dragon Clan’s martial techniques. While waiting for the Demonic Rune Tiger’s return, Lin Yun was entirely focused on cultivating the Divine Dragon Seals.

The Blue Dragon Seal was still manageable, but he encountered difficulty upon reaching the White Dragon Seal. Even with the detailed steps and mantra, Lin Yun barely succeeded after thousands of attempts.

Three days later, Lin Yun successfully learned three Divine Dragon Seals, the Blue Dragon Seal, the White Dragon Seal, and the Silver Dragon Seal. Although he still had a long way to reach greater mastery, the three Divine Dragon Seals strengthened his Sovereign Dragon Seal by one-fold.

Outside the den, the Demonic Rune Tiger returned. It felt that it had taken too long, making it feel anxious. But just when it was about to speak, Lin Yun suddenly opened his eyes and the Glorysun and Glorymoon Spirits appeared within his pupils, enveloped in flames.

Looking from afar, Lin Yun’s pupils looked like a sun and moon shining brightly. As a divine dragon aura swept out, the Demonic Rune Tiger was sent flying and threw out a mouthful of blood just when he wanted to speak.

When Lin Yun realized what he had done, the Glorysun and Glorymoon both disappeared from his pupils, along with the three Divine Dragon Seals. Looking at the Demonic Rune Tiger’s pathetic state, Lin Yun couldn’t help feeling a little sorry. But the power of the Divine Dragon Eyes had also become stronger, and he didn’t use his dragon origin earlier.

“Lord Lin, it’s me!” The Demonic Rune Tiger said. It thought it had alarmed Lin Yun, and Lin Yun was attacked by instinct.

Wearing an awkward expression, Lin Yun asked, “You found information on the ominous auras?”

“Yeah, I’ve found all four of them. Which one do you want me to start with?” The Demonic Rune Tiger asked.

“Tell me about the situation first.”

“The thousand-year ominous auras haven’t opened their wisdom. The ominous auras I found for Lord Lin are all above eight thousand years old. You can only go to the Myriad Demonic Peak if you want stronger ones. ten thousand or hundred thousand year ominous auras can be found there, and they have practically opened their wisdom.” The Demonic Rune Tiger said with a fawning expression. After all, it had worked hard to gather this information.

Lin Yun’s heart sank when he heard that, and he now knew why the Demonic Rune Tiger had taken so long. His master told him that hundred-year ominous auras were enough, but the ones the Demonic Rune Tiger found were at least eight thousand years old. This brought a bitter smile to Lin Yun’s face, “But they’re practically no different from ten-thousand-year ominous auras.”FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“There’s a difference. They might be close in strength, but ten-thousand-year ominous auras have practically opened their wisdom and are much stronger. With your strength, eight-thousand-year ominous auras shouldn’t be an issue.” The Demonic Rune Tiger explained.

“That’s right.” Lil’ Purple walked over.

“What’s my odds of winning, then?” Lin Yun asked with his eyes lit up.

“Zero.” Lil’ Purple replied.

“I guessed it…” Lin Yun wasn’t surprised by that answer.

“Eight-thousand-year ominous auras are comparable to the nine-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm in terms of strength or even the Samsara Edict Realm. You’ll die if you run into them.” Lil’ Purple smirked, and continued, “But it’s different with this empress around!”

Looking at her, Lin Yun had doubt on his face, and he said, “Although the Phoenix Tree has grown, you’ve also just reached the Dragon Pulse Realm, right?”

“Ha. How can your mind possibly comprehend my might?” Lil’ Purple said proudly.

“Be serious about it.” Lin Yun said.

“Ominous auras aren’t the same as demonic beasts. As long as they haven’t opened their wisdom, they’re simply non-living things. No matter how terrifying they are, you can subdue them if you know the trick. It’s hard to find the main body of the ominous auras, not to mention subduing them. I might not be able to deal with demonic beasts, but I can easily deal with ominous auras.” Lil’ Purple pouted.

“Why is that so?” Lin Yun asked.

Summoning a breeze with a wave of her hand, Lil’ Purple asked, “How do you think the wind should be subdued? You can block and shatter it, but can you catch the wind?”

Lin Yun squinted his eyes and fell into deep thought when he heard that.

“Hundred-year ominous auras are still fine because they’re no different from idiots. But it’s a different case for thousand-year ominous auras.” Lil’ Purple suddenly clasped her hands together, summoning a terrifying chill that covered the surroundings in a layer of frost.

“I mimicked the thousand-year ominous aura. Let me ask you then, where is the ominous ice aura?” Lil’ Purple hovered in the air. As the golden and crimson seal on her forehead bloomed, her hair grew and became silver. She also emitted a faint aura belonging to a divine beast that made her look sacred.

This left the Demonic Rune Tiger completely dumbfounded. It was first shocked before its eyes lit up brightly. It immediately came over with a fawning expression, “So it’s Lord Phoenix. With Lord Phoenix around, the ominous auras won’t be a problem. Hehe, let me know if you need me to do anything.”

The Demonic Rune Tiger’s flattery naturally brought a proud smirk to Lil’ Purple lips.

“Lord Phoenix, you must be tired of standing, right? You can sit on my back, and I’ll obey your commands!” The Demonic Rune Tiger lowered its head as it looked at Lil’ Purple like a kitten. This made Lil’ Purple laugh because this tiger teased her as she gently landed on its back.

But when Lil’ Red saw this while practicing its martial technique, it let out an unhappy snort.

Seeing this, the Demonic Rune Tiger immediately went over, “Lord Cat, you can also get up. Lord Lin, stop wasting time. Let's go. With Lord Phoenix around, the ominous auras are already in the bag.”

It had finally realized that the ranking was Lil’ Purple, Lil’ Red, then Lin Yun. But fortunately, it wasn’t late to get on Lil’ Purple’s good side. With Lord Phoenix around, it wouldn’t have to fear anyone within the Withered Mountain Range.

Right then, Lin Yun reached out and restricted a shapeless ominous aura before it condensed into an ominous white aura, caught with the Azure Dragon Grasp.

“Interesting.” Lin Yun smiled as he crushed the ominous aura with a palm. This surprised Lil’ Purple, and she wondered if Lin Yun was a monster. Just how did he manage to detect it?

“Let’s go. Lead the way.” Lin Yun smiled.

“Almighty Lord Lin! I’ll lead the way immediately.” The Demonic Rune Tiger was briefly startled as it bolted forth with Lil’ Purple and Lil’ Red on its back.

Lin Yun wasn’t in a hurry to leave. He turned back to look at the stone tablet, wondering if this tablet could be taken away. But he wasn’t in a hurry for now and swiftly caught up with the Demonic Rune Tiger.
