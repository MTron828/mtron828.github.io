Chapter 2318 - Lin Yun's Strength

“Brother Lin, what do you think of my suggestion?” Wu Yuhua invited.

Lin Yun briefly pondered, then smiled, “There should be something else to it, right?”

Wu Yuhua nodded, “The Heavenly Barren Realm is vast and boundless. Over the years, the forces from various realms have reached a particular understanding and divided the territory. This region is within the territory of the Azure Cloud Realm. It’s fine now, since everyone is busy hunting demonic beasts in the first month of arrival. After all, so many demonic beasts are around, and everyone can coexist peacefully. But it will change over time.”

Ji Zixi asked, “Can you further explain that?”

“Sure!” Wu Yuhua smiled and continued, “When demonic beasts are being excessively hunted, it will be harder to obtain more fortune. At that time, everyone will explore ruins and search for fruits. At that time, friction is inevitable.”

“You can also steal fortune from others by killing them?” Ji Zixi’s face changed. She never expected it to be so brutal.

Lin Yun was calm since he had already expected it. The world of cultivation was the survival of the fittest.

“This region is mainly controlled by the four major sects of the Azure Cloud Realm. So if you don’t have a sect, you will find it hard to move around when the time comes,” Wu Yuhua replied honestly.

“So, why did you invite Big Brother Lin to the Heavenly Sword Pavilion?” Ji Zixi immediately understood.

Wu Yuhua chuckled, “That’s not entirely true. Big Brother Lin has great skills in grilling meat, and he’s also a swordsman and an exceptionally talented one.”

Wu Yuhua was shocked by Lin Yun’s attack earlier, even if everything had happened in the blink of an eye. This was why he didn’t dare to approach at first, fearing that a conflict might take place. But after they chatted, he instantly realized that Lin Yun wasn’t that sort of person. He was proficient at grilling meat, and his understanding of sword dao was unique.

“I will remember this favor, but I want to focus on hunting demonic beasts now. So, can you wait for a few days?” Lin Yun asked.

“No need to hurry. We will have to kill until the fortune stops improving our saint dao. These are easy benefits, so we might as well harvest them,” Wu Yuhua smiled. “I will also be hunting demonic beasts. Why don’t we meet again half a month from now?”

“That works,” Lin Yun agreed.

“That’s a promise, then,” Wu Yuhua said with a hearty smile.

After resting for a night, Lin Yun asked when the day arrived, “Brother Wu, where can I find the Azure Abyssal Wolf pack? The meat tastes pretty good, and I plan to hunt a few more.”

“The pack is northeast of the Azure Wolf Valley. Hunting Azure Abyssal Wolves requires some strategy, since most people wouldn’t go there because it wasn’t worth the effort,” Wu Yuhua smiled. “So you require some planning if you want to go there. But you can’t kill too many, or the wolf pack will gang up on you, and it would be troublesome if you catch the alpha's attention.”

Lin Yun nodded and watched Wu Yuhua leave.

“Big Brother Lin, are you going to hunt the Azure Abyssal Wolves?” Ji Zixi asked.

“Yeah. We didn't previously understand the Heavenly Barren Realm, but we do now. So we don’t have to hold back. The Azure Abyssal Wolves possess dual attributes, and it would be a jackpot if I could run into a wolf with wind and thunder attributes,” Lin Yun replied.

The two continued their journey, coming across many people and everyone was peacefully coexisting. Lin Yun didn’t understand why there wasn’t any fight between these people. He didn’t understand it at first, but he soon realized that there were plenty of demonic beasts to go around, so there was no need for them to fight now.

Lin Yun and Ji Zixi came to the Azure Wolf Valley four hours later. It was just as Wu Yuhua said; not that many people could be seen here. This place was filled with saint energy, with many bizarre flowers growing in this valley, monopolized by the Azure Abyssal Wolves.

The Azure Abyssal Wolves were robust and would produce a loud sound whenever they walked around, causing the ground to tremble. Before Lin Yun could respond, three hundred wolves had surrounded them with howls echoing about, and a snow-white wolf could be seen standing on the mountain. It gave off a powerful aura with a terrifying, baleful aura that made the sky crimson.

“Two divine physiques and I can smell you guys from far away. I was preparing to look for you two, but you came to me instead,” the alpha wolf said in a hoarse voice as it stared at Lin Yun and Ji Zixi with greed reflected in its eyes.

Lin Yun instantly knew why that wolf gave up attacking Wu Yuhua and came after them. It was their divine physiques that lured it. Facing such a massive array for the first time, Ji Zixi panicked a little.

Lin Yun smiled, “Don’t be so sure who’s the prey.”

“Hmph, what impudence. I can’t be bothered to make a move against you two,” the alpha wolf sneered. The two might possess divine physiques, but they were fragile in the alpha wolf’s eyes. It ordered, “Kill them!”

The Azure Abyssal Wolves were all at the Saint Realm and had a decently high intelligence. Not to mention that they were swift when they received the alpha wolf’s order.

Just as the wolves charged forth, they alternated their positions and released their saint daos, causing the surrounding space to distort. They would even disguise their attacks, showing a high intelligence.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“This is interesting.” Lin Yun squinted with a smile. He would have been torn apart if they clashed when his cultivation was slightly lower. He now knew why Wu Yuhua wouldn’t be willing to provoke the Azure Abyssal Wolves.

As he circulated the two sword sutras, Lin Yun's sword intent merged with his aura and released a powerful aura that stabilized the surrounding distorted space.

“Your turn!” Lin Yun squinted before opening his eyes, and a terrifying chill spread out, making the wolf that he had locked onto tremble in fear. That wolf wanted to retreat, but Lin Yun was frighteningly fast as he circulated the Divine Sunchasing Art and left behind an afterimage with his punch landing on the skull of the wolf.

The wolf’s skull was the hardest part of its body, equivalent to a Glory Saint Artifact. But Lin Yun managed to crack it open with his punch. His sword intent poured into the crack, and the wolf blew apart.

Lin Yun executed his movement technique again and four corpses fell onto the ground the next moment.

Ji Zixi watched and was inwardly shocked. Just how powerful was Lin Yun? There seemed to be no limit to Lin Yun’s strength. She initially thought she could see through Lin Yun’s strength after awakening her phoenix bloodline, but she still had some way to go. Just how much did Lin Yun train with my father in this period of time?

A roar echoed that disrupted Ji Zixi’s thoughts and the wolf pack went berserk as it charged over. There were more than ten Azure Abyssal Wolves in each wave, and Lin Yun laughed as he released his Divine Light Sword Intent. Facing such an attack, Lin Yun couldn’t defeat them instantly, but his defense was tight. No matter how many of them came, he could drive them back.

Lin Yun used his fingers as swords, executing the Carefree 9 Swords and Divine Firefly Sword. He might appear to be alone, but he looked like a sword array with sword rays intertwining, slaughtering the wolf pack to the point that they became terrified of him, with the ground stained with blood as a blood stench filled the air.

“This is starting to become troublesome!” Lin Yun was tired of the endless fight, and his eyes shone brightly, forming the Dragon Sun and Moon Seal with one hand. His two sword stars formed into a robe that enveloped him with three thousand crimson ribbons.

“Myriad Swords Unite!” Lin Yun waved his hand and the three thousand ribbons soared to the sky behind him, enveloping the sky before they descended like rainbows. Ever since Lin Yun used this move in the Heavenly Void, he had pondered for a long time and merged it with the Great Profound Sword Canon’s Myriad Swords Unite.

Now that his cultivation was higher than before and his sword intent increased, he could summon ten thousand ribbons if he wanted to. Moreover, the ribbons could move seamlessly with his thoughts and release them much faster. It was so much faster than before.

When the wolf pack sensed the danger, it was too late for them to turn around and flee since they were nailed to the ground. The ribbons pierced into the wolves like spears, firmly pinning them to the ground. The ground was soon filled with wails and howls.

Ji Zixi took a deep breath since she had seen this once before, but she was still deeply shocked upon seeing it again.

“Alpha Wolf, die!” The Flower Burial Sword flew out from Lin Yun’s chest as he charged at the alpha wolf.

The alpha wolf was strong and was a sixth-stage Saint Lord. Most importantly, it had grasped the Thunder and Wind Daos, with saint daos numbering tens of thousands.

Compared to it, Lin Yun’s Sword Dao only had two to three hundred saint daos.

“You’re courting death!” The alpha wolf came to its senses. It couldn’t figure out how Lin Yun unleashed such a strong power despite being so small nor where Lin Yun got the courage to attack it.

“Nirvana of the Beginning!” Lin Yun couldn’t be bothered to talk to the alpha wolf and released the Nirvana Seal before appearing on the alpha wolf’s neck just when the alpha wolf’s paw was about to tear Lin Yun apart.

The Flower Burial Sword released a gigantic sword ray that left behind a horrifying wound on the alpha wolf’s neck, with blood gushing out. When the nirvana was finished, the past and present overlapped and Lin Yun retreated. The claw brushed past him as the violent gale ripped Lin Yun’s cloak, revealing the Azure Saint Cloth with his long hair fluttering about.

Beads of sweat dripped down his forehead, making him look weak. If the alpha wolf could still fight, he would be heavily injured with just one exchange. But the alpha wolf no longer had another opportunity since it was decapitated and the gigantic corpse fell towards Lin Yun. Lin Yun let go of the Flower Burial Sword and slowly retreated.

When he landed on the ground, the Flower Burial Sword turned into a streak of light and returned to his chest. Turning around, all the pinned wolves were killed, with the entire valley falling into silence, and fortunes could be seen floating around.

Behind Lin Yun, blood gushed out from the alpha wolf’s neck that formed a sea of blood beneath him. If Wu Yuhua saw this scene, he would probably be incredibly shocked.

Lin Yun turned to look at the alpha wolf’s corpse and fell into deep thoughts. He knew that his path was right and he might have needed to exchange thousands of moves with the alpha wolf if he relied on his Sword Dao or Divine Light Sword Intent, and it was unsure if he could slay the alpha wolf at that time.

This was because the alpha wolf was too powerful, with a ridiculous amount of saint daos. But using the Nirvana Dao despite the risk was really great because if the claw had reached him, he would have been torn apart in that instance. Furthermore, if he failed to kill his opponent, he would have been heavily injured, even if he wasn’t dead. He analyzed, “I have to become stronger.”

“Big Brother Lin, there’s a lot of fortune!” Ji Zixi said excitedly.

She was initially concerned about Lin Yun, but she didn’t expect him to kill the alpha wolf so easily. As a result, she could only change the topic to the fortune.

“Let’s split them,” Lin Yun smiled. “According to Wu Yuhua, they’re all free for us to collect. But this means that we can only consume roasted wolf meat for a period of time.”
