Chapter 1198 - Hundred Ghost Sword Array

There were many legends involving the Lightning Shadow Sword, and practically all the swordsmen in the Eastern Desolation had heard of this sword. After all, it was forged by the Mo Clan who was more famous than the Hidden Sword Pavilion. The Mo Clan was known for their mysterious nature and how they were beyond the reach of ordinary people.

There were many legends about the Mo Clan because they weren’t only focused on forging swords. The Mo Clan was proficient in forging artifacts, secret treasures, and puppets. They also had various secret techniques and wine.

So anything that was engraved with the Mo Clan’s name would increase in value by several times. The Hidden Sword Manor had over three thousand pavilions that covered the entire Kunlun Realm. The reason why the Azure Rock Hidden Sword Pavilion had such huge fame was because of the Lightning Shadow Sword.

The other pavilions also had famous thousand rune saint swords, but the Azure Rock Hidden Sword Pavilion’s Lightning Shadow Sword was the most famous. This was also Feng Xuanzi’s pride and as long as the Lightning Shadow Sword remained, the glory of the Feng Clan would remain even after Feng Xuanzi’s death.

Many people knew about the Lightning Shadow Sword’s existence, but not many people know about its origin. So when they heard that Lin Yun was here to retrieve the sword, they locked their brows tightly because they knew that trouble was brewing.

At the same time, Feng Xuanzi’s huge reaction had surpassed their imagination and even an idiot could hear the threat in his tone. However, it wasn’t nearly as breathtaking as Lin Yun’s unshakable voice.

Feng Xuanzi was briefly stunned before he smiled coldly, “Jian Jingtian is really as naive as before to send such a talented disciple to die. I won’t stop you from retrieving the sword as this is the rule set by the Hidden Sword Manor. But…”

He swept his glance at Luo Hua with a grave expression and asked, “Young Master Luo, the outcome has nothing to do with me and my Hidden Sword Pavilion if he dies during the challenge, right?”

Lin Yun squinted his eyes because he knew that Feng Xuanzi only kept his composure because he was afraid of Luo Hua’s existence. He now knew why the old geezer wanted Luo Hua to come along.

Young Master Luo? Where did this person come from? Everyone followed Feng Xuanzi’s gaze and saw a white-clothed lady wearing a hood over her head and a veil to cover her face. Although Luo Hua maintained a low-profile the entire time, Feng Xuanzi made everyone feel curious about her identity. After all, she had to have a shocking origin if Feng Xuanzi was giving her face.

When everyone turned to look at Luo Hua, they were shocked because they couldn’t see through her. In fact, she gave off a mysterious temperament.

“Who is she?” Zhao Yan muttered inwardly because he could tell with a glance that Luo Hua wasn’t simple, but he couldn’t recall who she was.

As for Feng Xiaoyu, she had a look of shock flash through her pupils before she cursed inwardly. But she didn’t dare to show any emotions on her face because she now knew how terrifying Luo Hua was. Luo Hua was someone that not even her grandfather dared to offend.

Luo Hua continued to stare at Lin Yun and said, “I’m not going to repeat his words, he’s the one making the decision here.”

Her words instantly made all the swordsmen jealous. They hated to see such an extraordinary woman act gently towards Lin Yun. Clearly, she cared what Lin Yun thought.

Gong Haoran was unhappy because he knew that Luo Hua definitely had an extraordinary identity.

“She seems a little familiar. Don’t tell me she’s…” Ye Feifan suddenly had an idea of who Luo Hua was and he was shocked by his guess. However, he shook his head and thought back to Lin Yun who was acting too impulsively.

The three arrays were created by the ancestor of the Hidden Sword Manor, and each pavilion had a simplified version of the arrays. But even if the arrays were simplified, they were still dangerous to the challengers. In fact, all those who challenged the arrays were killed. There were so many people that died that no one dared to challenge the arrays anymore.

“Permitted!” Feng Xuanzi said while clenching his teeth. He then returned to his seat after making his announcement.

The plaza was silent right now because everyone knew how tense the situation was. If Lin Yun managed to retrieve the sword, he would become even more famous.

“This fellow is really insane.” Gongsun Yan shook his head after he got out of the lake. Even he didn’t dare to think about retrieving the Lightning Shadow Sword. Not to mention him, but even the heir of the Sword Emperor would hesitate to take it. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

As the gigantic sword sank down, the statues of the eight ominous beasts also disappeared into the lake. When it was done, the entire plaza turned into a plain field. When Lin Yun landed on the ground, he could sense the spiritual runes changing in the ground.

Lin Yun wasn’t confident in the challenge, but that didn’t mean he could back off. He already made a promise to the old geezer, so he had to try.

Perhaps he wasn’t confident in retrieving the sword, but he knew he could protect himself. After all, no one knew that his physique was comparable to a saint artifact. Furthermore, he didn’t reveal all of his trump cards in the previous battles.

“Brother Lin, the first round is the Hundred Ghost Sword Array. You can’t waste time during the first round because it’s connected to the second round and you don’t get any breaks. This is a little trick of the Hidden Sword Manor because many people try to preserve their energy in the first round. But in reality, not only can you not afford to be injured in the first round, you have to end the battle quickly. Otherwise, you’ll die in the second round.” Ye Feifan’s voice sounded out beside Lin Yun’s ears.

When Lin Yun turned to look at Ye Feifan, he noticed that Ye Feifan was frozen in place. Ye Feifan was probably afraid that the Feng Clan would find out about his secret transmission.

Lin Yun realized that Ye Feifan was correct. The three arrays were famous and terrifying. Most people would rather suffer injuries than reveal their trump cards in the first round.

“There are ancestral teachings from the Hidden Sword Manor that those who can pass through the three rounds can retrieve the treasured sword in the Hidden Sword Pavilions located in Kunlun Realm. The first round, Hundred Ghost Sword Array!” Feng Xuanzi said.

When he finished the announcement, a hundred black-clothed swordsmen donning a devil mask landed on the stage from various directions. Even if they didn’t wear masks, their killing intent was scary.

Lin Yun squinted his eyes and vaguely understood why the Sword Assembly would restrict everyone’s cultivation in the Heavenly Soul Realm. It was because the arrays were more restricting to Heavenly Soul Realms than it was to empyreans.

Lin Yun wasn’t just facing a hundred opponents, but the cooperation between the hundred people and a sword array. So as time passed, their advantage would become stronger.

Suddenly, Lin Yun felt that something was off. It seemed like he became part of the sword array. It wasn’t an easy discovery, but it was crucial for him. However, he had no idea what he was looking for.

“Kill!” Feng Xuanzi ordered, unleashing a chill out in the plaza. When the Hundred Ghost Sword Array was activated, the swords in the hundred swordsmen began to change. They got closer and closer until they surrounded Lin Yun, which placed him under immense pressure.

The Grand Elder of the Feng Clan looked at Lin Yun’s sword because Lin Yun would be a dead person if he dared to draw his sword. It was simply a pipe dream for Lin Yun to retrieve the Lightning Shadow Sword.

When the Flower Burial Sword hummed, Lin Yun’s heart shook. He realized that the core of the Hundred Ghost Sword Array lay in his sword. His back was covered in cold sweat as he thought about it. Then, the swordsmen drew their swords and sent countless sword rays towards him.
