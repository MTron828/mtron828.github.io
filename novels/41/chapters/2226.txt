Chapter 2227 - Ordinary

Lin Yun saw hundreds of Saint Lords. The Eastern Desolation alone had many saint clans, so no one knew how many saints were there in the Eastern Desolation. If the demonic forces and wandering cultivators were considered, the numbers would increase to over a thousand.

Lin Yun couldn’t see Saints that often in the past because his level wasn’t there yet, and the great changes hadn’t arrived. If he didn’t have the strength to confront Saints, he wouldn’t have come to the God Burial Mountain Range and couldn’t have seen such a spectacular scene.

He wouldn’t be able to see this scene if he hadn't become stronger. The great changes were easy to understand since there weren’t so many treasures in Kunlun Realm in the past that were valuable enough to acquire the attention of Saints. It was so different now because the Divine Blood Fruit and divine flames alone were tempting, and there were many ancient sects beneath the God Burial Mountain Range with countless resources.

In the spatial crack, a saint had died with his saint constellation destroyed.

“Saint Lords at the fifth stage still can’t enter!”

“Judging from the past few days, Saint Lords above the fourth stage can’t enter even though the restriction has loosened up.”

“Saint Lords at the first stage can enter, but just barely. It’s safer for Saint Lords at the second stage to the fourth stage to enter.”

“As for Quasi-Saints, they would die the moment they came in contact with the spatial crack.” Discussions resounded as everyone watched a Saint Lord’s death.

Lin Yun circulated his saint aura while mixing into the crowd, fearlessly heading towards the spatial crack.

“That fellow seems to be a Quasi-Saint?”

“Your eyes must be messing with you. Without saint energy, how can anyone possibly bear the pressure? They would die if they got close.”

“Maybe.”

Lin Yun’s appearance didn’t cause much of an uproar because there were too many people, and no one paid special attention to him. Even if they noticed him, they would suspect that their eyes were fooling with them.

“It seems possible.” Lin Yun easily made it through the spatial crack that could crush Quasi-Saints. The pressure was lower than the second peak of Blood Purgatory Mountain, and there wasn’t any difficulty for Lin Yun.

But the inside of the God Burial Mountain Range had changed with the entire place being crimson red. Lin Yun didn’t know where the spatial crack brought him, but he felt that the entire world had become red. He squinted his eyes, and exclaimed, “Blood Crows!”

Blood Crows were initially gathered in the Myriad Grave Valley, but they could be seen anywhere, attacking any life forms that they saw. In the past, Lin Yun could deal with these Blood Crows at the Dragon Pulse Realm, but they have all become more powerful than before. Many of the Blood Crows leaders were at the Quasi-Saint Realm, and some were at the Saint Realm, which was unbelievable.

“Why did these Blood Crows emerge from the Myriad Grave Valley?” Lil’ Purple asked in surprise.

Before Lin Yun could reply to her, a flock of Blood Crows had already charged over.

Circulating his saint dao, Lin Yun pushed his palm forth with a thunderstorm gathering in his palm, forming a terrifying vortex. “Azure Dragon Grasp!”

The vortex immediately tore the Blood Crows apart in groups, with Lil’ Purple also helping out.

Ten miles away, there was a youth with a lotus blooming beneath him, calmly facing a few hundred Blood Crows. After this black-clothed youth formed seals, flames ignited on the lotus beneath him, and he flicked his finger, “Dragon Jade Flame Lotus!”

Whenever he flicked his finger, a flaming dragon would fly out that incinerated the Blood Crows into ashes.

“He’s strong.” Lin Yun said.

“That’s an ancient secret technique,” Lil’ Purple praised. “In ancient times, an ancient clan was famous for nurturing lotuses, and their descendants could receive a saint lotus once they reached the Saint Realm. The Dragon Jade Flame Lotus could be considered a rare saint lotus. If that clan still exists, it should be one of the Eight Imperial Clans, the Li Clan. I wonder if he has anything to do with the Li Clan.”

The black-clothed youth turned around to look at them, acting as if he had heard what Lil’ Purple said. He wasn’t initially concerned, but he soon frowned with surprise flashing in his eyes. He gazed over Lin Yun and Lil’ Purple before disappearing with a flash.

“The Eight Imperial Clans… the Jian Clan, Mo Clan… Xiao Clan and now there’s the Li Clan,” Lin Yun muttered to himself. The Eight Imperial Clans were mysterious, and he had directly come into contact with three of them.

His master was from the Jian Clan, the Mo Clan produced the Millennium Flame, and the white-clothed bladesman he met before was from the Xiao Clan. Now, he met another one of the Eight Imperial Clans.

With the great change, these people would probably start appearing more often.

“Why don’t we catch up with him and ask him what the Eight Imperial Clans are trying to do?” Lil’ Purple fearlessly suggested.

“That person is cautious, and there’s no need to form any enmity with him. Let’s go and look at Six Holy City,” Lin Yun said, shaking his head.

The six holy lands once controlled Six Holy City, but it was destroyed by the Blood Moon Sect and Demonspirit Clan, and the six holy lands’ forces were chased out. That’s why Lin Yun wanted to take a look and see what happened.

Six Holy City was in ruins when he arrived, with only the altar remaining. The altar was enveloped in a black fog with boundless corpses lying within a hundred miles in radius. Lin Yun could tell that a ceremony was held here but failed.

The corpses of those lying on the ground were from the holy lands, and there were even some cultivators donned in crimson armor that looked familiar. Aside from that, there wasn’t a single living person here. As for the Blood Moon Sect and Demonspirit Clan, they were nowhere to be seen.

Lin Yun looked at the crimson armor and had a bad premonition because it seemed to be the saint armor of the Blood Word Battalion. When he raised his head, he saw that there was a crack in the ancient altar, and the top of the altar was enveloped in a light pillar.

Beneath the altar, terrifying roars could be heard. It’s as though the altar was sealing a powerful existence.

“Lin Yun, this altar has the Nirvana Sword Intent on it,” Lil’ Purple said.

Lin Yun also noticed something, and the doubt in his eyes grew. He had no idea what was going on.

“Should we go there?” Lil’ Purple asked with uncertainty. She had always been fearless but noticed something weird about this place.

Lin Yun looked at the altar and saw traces of battles around, and there seemed to be something in the crack. His instincts told him that the altar was dangerous and shouldn’t be touched carelessly, even if there wasn’t the Nirvana Sword Intent on it.

Taking a deep breath, Lin Yun turned around, “Friend, you have been following me for some time now. Show yourself.”

Lin Yun was looking at a tattered wall.

“There’s someone here? Why didn’t I notice it?” Lil’ Purple exclaimed.

A brief moment later, a black-clothed youth emerged from the shadows, the same person they had seen. The black-clothed youth said, “As expected of Flower Burial. I’m impressed by your sword intent.”

“You know me?” Lin Yun asked.

“Who in the Kunlun Realm doesn’t know about the famous Flower Burial?” The black-clothed youth said indifferently as though he was stating something normal. He initially wanted to leave after hearing what Lil’ Purple said. But he found Lin Yun to be familiar when he turned around before realizing that this person was Flower Burial, the direct disciple of the Radiant Sword Saint.

After the ninth, Lin Yun’s identity had been exposed, and everyone knew that Ye Qingtian was Lin Yun. This further brought Lin Yun’s fame to a new height, and some ancient clans began to pay attention to him.

“Don’t worry about it. I have no enmity against you. I’m only curious as to why the famous Flower Burial is here. My surname is Li, and my name is Feibai.” The black-clothed youth introduced himself to express goodwill.

“One of the Eight Imperial Clans’ Li Clan?” Lin Yun asked.

“Your friend was right,” Li Feibai said, looking at Lil’ Purple. He continued, “I advise you not to get close to that altar. It is dangerous.”

“You know what happened here?” Lin Yun asked.

“Who doesn’t know? It’s not a secret, either way.” Li Feibai briefly paused, but soon came to his senses before continuing, “It looks like the Heavenly Dao Sect can’t be bothered about anything else right now for you not to know such a huge incident.”

“Cut the crap and speak if you know,” Lil’ Purple said impatiently.

Li Feibai wasn’t bothered with Lil’ Purple’s rudeness, and said, “There’s no harm telling you about it…”

Listening to Li Feibai, Lin Yun finally understood what was happening here. After the Blood Moon Sect and Demonspirit Clan occupied Six Holy City, they wanted to undo the seal here. But they only had the Lunar Divine Rune, so it was risky to hold the ceremony.

They had no choice but to perform an ancient ceremony with the Quasi-Saints that they had captured, wanting to lift the seal around the God Burial Mountain Range.

But in the critical moment, the Ninth Princess arrived with the Blood Word Battalion, and a battle broke out. The ceremony was ruined, and the altar’s energy leaked out, destroying all of Six Holy City.

“The restriction is already at its limit, but there’s a mysterious energy coming from the direction of the Myriad Graves Valley that has stabilized the restriction and sealed the darkness for now,” Li Feibai said. “You know what happened after that. The altar has lost control, and that sword ray will exist for some time, even if the restriction is already loose. If you get close to the altar, you might be corroded by the darkness and be attacked by that sword ray. Just look at the corpses on the ground; that’s how most of them died.”

“Where’s the Ninth Princess?” Lin Yun frowned.

Li Feibai said, “Both parties suffered heavy casualties when the altar cracked, including those from the Demonspirit Clan. As for the Ninth Princess's location, it became a mystery after she was injured.”

Lin Yun’s heart skipped a beat when he heard that Su Ziyao was injured.

“Many people are looking for her. I heard that a treasure flew out from the altar and was obtained by her. But no one knows where she was right now,” Li Feibai shared everything he knew.

“Thank you,” Lin Yun thanked. This was bad news just when he entered the God Burial Mountain Range.

Li Feibai glanced at Lin Yun, and asked, “If I’m not wrong, you’re only at the Quasi-Saint, right?”

“That’s right,” Lin Yun replied.

Li Feibai smiled, “It’s best if you don’t go too deep. This place is more chaotic than you think, and the Heavenly Dao Sect can’t help you here. If someone wants to kill you, there’s no better place than the God Burial Mountain Range.”RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“We don’t need your concern; you should be concerned about yourself, instead,” Lil’ Purple said unhappily.

Li Feibai said, “Even though you know my origins, you don’t believe in my strength? I’m not boasting, but no place in the God Burial Mountain Range can stop me.”

Just when Lil’ Purple was about to flare up, she was stopped by Lin Yun as he said, “No matter what, thanks for your information.”

Li Feibai shook his head and said, “No need to thank me. I’m only here to see if there’s anything special about the famous Flower Burial.”

“So?” Lin Yun asked.

“Ordinary,” Li Feibai said as he examined Lin Yun. He briefly paused, then continued, “I let you detect me on purpose. Times have changed, and even the Heavenly Dragon Lord is nothing. You better not take it seriously, or you won’t even know how you died.”

Li Feibai wasn’t arrogant as he said that in a calm tone. His tone also didn’t hint at enmity, but his words were insulting.

“I’ll be taking my leave now,” Li Feibai left, proving that what he said wasn’t wrong. His movement technique was bizarre, and he appeared a hundred miles away in a few breaths.

“That fellow is annoying,” Lil’ Purple said.

“Don’t care about him for now.” Lin Yun was worried about Su Ziyao and couldn’t find any traces after searching for a long time.

Not long later, a heatwave blew over as Lil’ Purple and Lin Yun appeared before a river of magma. This was the Flame Dragon River, the previous border.

In the past, the Flame Dragon River was a forbidden ground, filled with danger. Quasi-Saints would only die here if they came. But now that the restriction was lifted, it was no longer a forbidden ground.

“The other side of the river is called the Heavenly Void, and no one knows what is inside. No one has ever come back from the other side,” Lin Yun said.

Many Saints have gathered at the river's edge, but no one moved because there were many Saint corpses floating on the river. Those were Saints who had rashly tried to cross over and died. The corpses showed how frightening the river was.

“The people from the holy lands are here!” A commotion resounded.
