Chapter 620 - Fight!

“I’ve seen many people that were full of themselves, but no one can match your arrogance. But it doesn’t matter since you’re going to die today,” said Ji Wuye with disdain on his face as he clearly never placed Lin Yun in his eyes.

“Life and death isn’t determined by mere words,” replied Lin Yun.

“That’s right. So let me see how capable you are!” Ji Wuye couldn’t hold back his killing intent. When he was talking with Lin Yun, he had been trying to find a flaw in Lin Yun’s aura. But Lin Yun’s sword intent was too sharp, so there weren’t any flaws under his bloodlust.

As he yelled, Ji Wuye gathered all his energy into his right fist and a dazzling ball of flames burst out.

“Let’s fight then,” replied Lin Yun indifferently. They were standing at the center of the lake and their actions were clearly seen by spectators at the border of the Withernorth Sea. Everyone in the crowd held their breath and watched the battle.

Then, Lin Yun and Ji Wuye’s aura reached a suffocating level. Their aura alone was enough to send chills down the spine of others.

All of a sudden, Ji Wuye attacked first as he stomped his foot on the surface of the lake, raising a hundred foot tall screen of water behind him. Shortly after, he crossed the distance of a few hundred meters with a step.

When he punched Lin Yun, the flames shrouding his fist began to swell, reaching the size of a house in the blink of an eye. At the same time, a skull had manifested from his attack and flew towards Lin Yun.

Was this Ji Wuye’s true power? Lin Yun didn’t hesitate to draw the Flower Burial Sword as he slashed out with a momentum equal to Ji Wuye. He was using one of the three ultimate moves of the Aquaselenic Sword, Luminous Moon.

He had previously relied on this move to defeat Qin An and Pei Yue. Ji Wuye’s attack was too ferocious, so Lin Yun had to resort to this attack right from the start. Lin Yun’s attack had emitted a dazzling moonlight. It was stronger now that the Flower Burial Sword had reached the level of a cosmic artifact.

Shrouded in moonlight, Lin Yun’s attack slashed down at the gigantic crimson skull. The skull shattered into pieces in a split second as the fragments fell onto the ground. Simultaneously, the attack left a deep crater of a few hundred meters inside the lake.

Shortly after, a series of explosions occurred as hundreds of geysers shot into the sky wanting to pierce through the void. After destroying Ji Wuye’s attack, Lin Yun took a step forward with the Seven Profound Step as the Golden Crow Seal bloomed behind him.

He turned into a golden beam and charged towards Ji Wuye with his sword slashing down. For a moment, the entire region was enveloped by the afterimages of his sword.

Every silver sword image emitted a bright radiance after being empowered by Lin Yun’s xiantian sword intent at greater mastery.

Facing Lin Yun’s attacks, Ji Wuye snorted as his surroundings surged with bloodlust that formed into crimson armor. The armor looked strange like it was made up of blood. It even looked like it would devour the swords that were landing on it. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

By the time the force behind the sword reached Ji Wuye, it had already been significantly weakened. Even if the Flower Burial Sword had been upgraded to a cosmic artifact and further empowered by Lin Yun’s sword intent, it was still troublesome to deal with Ji Wuye’s armor.

Ji Wuye sneered, “Sword intent isn’t omnipotent. Even if your xiantian sword intent has reached greater mastery, it’s nothing to me at your current cultivation.”

As he spoke, his surroundings surged with even more powerful bloodlust.

Lin Yun frowned his brows as his attacks couldn’t pierce through Ji Wuye’s armor. He swung his wrist and unleashed more sword rays towards Ji Wuye, but his attacks were greatly weakened when they came in contact with the crimson armor.

With Ji Wuye’s cultivation, Lin Yun’s attacks that passed through the armor could be neglected. He completely disregarded the attacks and charged at Lin Yun. Once again, he threw another punch out that had manifested a crimson skull.

Facing Ji Wuye, there was no change to Lin Yun’s facial expression as he continued to retaliate with his sword. With another explosion, Lin Yun was sent a few hundred meters away, but he gently landed on the surface of the lake like a butterfly.

“This fellow…” Ji Wuye was enraged that Lin Yun had resolved his attack with his deep attainments in the way of sword. At the same time, Ji Wuye had completely lost his patience.

Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly as he looked at Ji Wuye. His xiantian sword intent wasn’t sharp enough to pierce the bizarre armor. Then again, it was definitely not easy for Ji Wuye to maintain the armor. “Heavenly Cloud Shatter!”

Along with another sword buzz that echoed out, the surface of the lake exploded and formed a massive tornado that roared as it headed towards Ji Wuye.

“You want to break my crimson armor with this much? How naive!” Ji Wuye snorted as he threw another punch out. But the crimson flames blazing on his fist was even more ferocious than the tornado and it looked as if it could destroy everything.

When the two attacks clashed, the water tornado shattered. When the droplets of water containing Lin Yun’s sword intent landed on the surface of the lake, they exploded and left behind craters. But Ji Wuye wasn’t bothered by this terrifying scene as he carried on with his charge.

With another explosion, Lin Yun and Ji Wuye were both knocked back. This scene shocked everyone outside the empyrean’s tomb.

“Ji Wuye is really strong. He’s not even using his sword and his punches are already so terrifying. A single one of his punches can easily take my life.”

“That crimson armor is the bane of all swordsmen. The armor alone has crippled most of Lin Yun’s xiantain sword intent.”

“Lin Yun is trying to exhaust Ji Wuye’s armor, but it doesn’t seem to be effective at all.”

“Ji Wuye is ultimately stronger. Facing the crimson armor, Lin Yun is already in a disadvantageous position.”

It was rare to see such an intense fight among the younger generations as the two of them were a little heaven-defying. At the same time, everyone knew that they were just probing each other. However, Ji Wuye clearly held the upper hand.

Xie Yunqiao, Yan Kong, and the rest saw this clearly and sneered coldly. In the end, Lin Yun was a little too native to think that he could defeat Ji Wuye.

“You want to defeat me? I don’t even need to draw my sword to kill you!” Ji Wuye stood on the lake with his hands on his back as his crimson armor glowed bewitchingly.

“Is that so?” Lin Yun smiled with mockery in his eyes as the boundless sword intent contained in the droplets suddenly exploded on Ji Wuye’s armor and sent him flying without any warning.

Retracting the smile on his lips, Lin Yun swung the Flower Burial Sword and smacked it against a droplet of water, pouring his sword intent into it. The entire lake began to tremble and Ji Wuye, who was sent flying away, looked at the approaching water droplet in horror.

Before the water droplet came in contact with him, he drew out his sword and held it horizontally to block the attack. But when the droplet of water came in contact with his sword, an explosion occurred that raised a hundred meter screen of water around Ji Wuye.

Blood seeped out of Ji Wuye’s lips as his face became ugly. After all, he had just claimed that he wouldn’t even need his sword to kill Lin Yun. He had slapped his own face in a matter of seconds.

“Ji Wuye, you better be serious or you might really lose your life,” said Lin Yun indifferently as he looked at Ji Wuye.
