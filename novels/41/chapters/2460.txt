Chapter 2461 - Battle in Skysolute City

Lin Yun didn’t give up and asked, “Is there no way to restore your status as a myth?”

This was a serious matter because if the Black Emperor couldn’t restore his status as a myth, he would be reduced to an ordinary emperor.

“If you used the sovereign divine runes, I would probably fall from the Emperor Realm,” the Black Emperor nodded.

Lin Yun was surprised because he hadn’t expected the Myriad Celestial Sword to be so powerful. But Lin Yun also suffered the price as he felt weak and incapable of standing up. Executing it would've drained all his vitality if he didn’t have a powerful physique.

If he used the Sovereign Divine Runes, the price would be unimaginable, and it would be a suicide with the enemy. The Iris Sword Saint shouldn’t have paid any price when he used it back then. Perhaps things might be different if he reached the pinnacle of the Great Saint Realm. But now that he used it on the Black Emperor, he couldn’t help feeling uneasy.

Seeing Lin Yun’s expression, the Black Emperor smiled, “It doesn’t matter. Perhaps I can even reach the Deity Realm if the Heavenly Path was reforged. My status as a myth came from the Iris Sword Saint, and your sword helped me sever the karma instead.”

Lin Yun was stunned, not knowing what the Black Emperor said was true.

The White Emperor said, “There’s such a benefit? Why don’t you give me a sword as well?”

“He would have to use the Sovereign Divine Runes. I have tested the sword for Lin Yun, and you can test the Myriad Celestial Sword using Sovereign Divine Runes,” the Black Emperor smiled.

The White Emperor glared at the Black Emperor, “You want me dead?”

“Hahaha!” The Black Emperor laughed.

“Let’s go back to the Sword Sect first,” Lil’ Purple said.

When they returned to the Sword Sect, Lin Yun returned to his Cloud Soaring Peak. Returning to his residence again, Lin Yun felt complicated. But before he could exclaim more, Lil' Purple dragged him into the Iris Secret Realm and sat down beneath the Phoenix Tree.

The Phoenix Tree was over a thousand feet now, emitting a saint radiance and a faint fragrance.

When Lil’ Purple waved her hand, strands of golden light enveloped Lin Yun and entered his body. This recovered all of Lin Yun’s exhausted vitality, and the process didn’t take long.

“This is really magical,” Lin Yun exclaimed. “I exhausted almost half of my vitality earlier. Although it didn’t affect me, it would still take me at least half a month to recover.”

“This is a reward from the Phoenix Tree. Back then, you gave the divine dragon saint liquid that you obtained with great difficulty to the Phoenix Tree, and you deserve it,” Lil’ Purple smiled.

“It won’t cause any side effects to it, right?” Lin Yun asked.

Glancing at the Phoenix Tree, Lil’ Purple smiled, “It’s fine. It’s happy that it can finally help you now!”

The Phoenix Tree swayed, producing a rustling sound as if it was responding to Lil’ Purple.

Lin Yun merely smiled and felt that what he had contributed in the past was worth it. An hour later, after recovering more or less, he said, “I’m going out to walk around.”

Lil’ Purple naturally knew who Lin Yun wanted to meet, and she didn’t stop him. Since Lin Yun came to the Sword Sect, he never rested again. Now that he finally had some casual time, he naturally had to reunite with his martial brothers.

Walking out of the Divine Firmament Peak, Lin Yun looked for Ye Ziling, Ye Ziyun, Mu Qingqing, Zhao Yan, Gongsun Yan, and Jin Xuanyi, along with those who had previously fought by his side. After meeting again, there wasn’t any barrier between them, and they chatted for a long time, with Lin Yun sharing his experience after leaving the Sword Sect.

“Senior Brother, can you tell us more about your experience as Ye Qingtian? We love to hear that! What’s with your title as the Holy Maiden Killer?” Gongsun Yan smiled, drawing everyone else's laughter when they heard that.

After all, the Holy Maiden Killer’s title resounded back then, and they had even heard of it in the Ancient Barren Domain. They were deeply shocked when they discovered that Lin Yun was Ye Qingtian.

“Ye Qingtian is Ye Qingtian. What does it have anything to do with me, Flower Burial?” Lin Yun replied.

“Hahaha!” Everyone laughed, recalling back to the time when Lin Yun had just joined the Sword Sect. Back then, he was still a young man.

“What’s your strength now?” Ye Ziling asked. She had a strong personality, and she could feel that Lin Yun’s cultivation had become even more unfathomable. Even if Lin Yun had restrained himself, they could still sense how extraordinary he had become from his actions alone.

“I’m not sure about that,” Lin Yun replied after pondering briefly. He was in the divinity stage of the Great Saint Realm, but he could reach the pinnacle of Great Saint Realm at any time with the remnant energies in his body. Most importantly, he didn’t have to cultivate because he carried the Iris Sword Box.

Ye Ziling smiled and didn’t ask any further. She wanted to catch up to Lin Yun’s footsteps in the past, but she eventually gave up after seeing how strong Lin Yun had become. She said, “Senior Brother Lin, Lady Luo Hua is still waiting for you. You can’t go back on your words, and you have to bring her back!”

“That’s for sure,” Lin Yun smiled.

“Junior Brother, master wants to see you.” Ye Guhan’s voice sounded, which Lin Yun bade his farewell with everyone.

When Lin Yun arrived at the Radiant Sword Emperor’s residence, his senior brothers and sisters were all present.

“Junior Brother, you’re here. Master plans to guide us on our cultivation after reaching the Emperor Realm, and you’re the only one left,” Ye Guhan said.

Lin Yun nodded and greeted the other martial brothers and sisters before entering the secret realm and meeting their master. He cupped his fists together, “Disciple Lin Yun pays his respect to master!”

The Radiant Sword Emperor smiled, “I have been waiting for you to come out of your seclusion, and I can finally see you now. Have a seat.”

“Master, you want to guide me in my cultivation?” Lin Yun asked after sitting down.

The Radiant Sword Emperor smiled, “The Black Emperor already told me your situation, and there’s nothing I can teach you. We can only discuss our attainment in the sword.”

“I’m not worthy,” Lin Yun said.

“What’s worthy and not worthy? Your attainment in the sword isn’t any weaker than me now,” the Radiant Sword Emperor laughed.

Lin Yun smiled awkwardly and didn’t dare to admit it. He changed the topic, “Master, do you know what’s above the ninth-grade sword intent?”

The Radiant Sword Emperor was briefly stunned before he said with a complicated gaze, “ABove the ninth-grade sword intent has never been recorded in the history of Kunlun Realm, and there are only rumors about it. But I can be sure that the Sword Ancestor had reached it in the past. But I never saw any record of it, even when I originate from the Jian Clan. Years ago, I thought Yu Qingfeng was beyond the ninth-grade sword intent. But when I asked him this time, he didn’t give me an exact answer, and I also don’t know about it.”

Lin Yun’s face changed upon hearing that because that was a question. Even in the Qilin Sword Canon, the Qilin Sword Immortal mentioned nothing about the sword intent beyond the ninth-grade. Saint dao was an amplifier for martial intent, and if the ninth-grade was the peak, he could only focus on sword dao for his future cultivation.

However, other emperors and deities were fine because they could spend their effort on Eternal Daos. Even if they couldn’t grasp Eternal Daos, they could carry on making breakthroughs on their Sovereign Dao, just that their martial intent would become weak.

“Beyond the ninth-grade is a myth?” Lin Yun asked.

“I have a feeling that if someone can go beyond the ninth grade, the Sword Dao might reach the same level as Eternal Daos,” the Radiant Sword Emperor said. “That was the case for the Sword Ancestor in the past, but such secrets cannot be recorded as Heavenly Dao didn’t accept them.”

Lin Yun was alarmed upon hearing that. Raising the Sword Dao to the same level as Eternal Daos? That was unthinkable to him. He asked, “Is that true?”

“I’m not sure about it. The battle between Yu Qingfeng and I is coming close, and you can come with me to the Skysolute City with your martial brothers and sister,” the Radiant Sword Emperor said, shaking his head. “My objective in this battle isn’t to win but to seek an answer.”

Lin Yun’s eyes blazed with expectation, and he said, “Master, what are your odds of winning?”

“My odds aren’t high, but I will have no regret after this battle. Since that sword three thousand years ago, I’ve always dreamt of fighting him, and I’m finally worthy now,” the Radiant Sword Emperor smiled.

Looking at the anticipation on his master’s face, Lin Yun wasn’t worried because he knew that his master no longer had an obsession in his heart. He and the entire Kunlun Realm were looking forward to that battle.

Since the news of Yu Qingfeng and Radiant Sword Emperor’s battle spread out, all swordsmen in Kunlun Realm were alarmed. After all, no one could shake Yu Qingfeng’s title as the Sword Emperor for thousands of years. There wasn’t even a worthy challenger simply because Yu Qingfeng was too powerful.

But the news of the Radiant Sword Saint becoming an Emperor spread far and wide, not to mention that he even faced three emperors on the Scarlet Firmament Peak, defeating the Silver Dragon King. Many people speculated about the Radiant Sword Emperor’s strength, but no one expected him to challenge Yu Qingfeng immediately.

Because of that, the sect masters of many sects who focused on swordsmanship rushed to Skysolute City with their disciples. Countless swordsmen gathered in the Skysolute City, all here to observe this battle destined to shake the world.

At the same time, news began to spread that the Empress would hold a Deitification Ceremony. At this ceremony, she would officially attempt to reach the Deity Realm, becoming the first to do so in the past three thousand years. This piece of news was also explosive, but it wasn’t certain. So, it hadn’t been completely spread out in Kunlun Realm.

The Blade Emperor was baffled in the Profound Imperial Palace as he looked at the Empress, “Yan Chen, the ceremony is more or less prepared. Why are you not announcing the date?”

All the resources required for this ceremony, including the ceremonial stage, had been prepared. As long as the Empress was willing, she could host the ceremony whenever possible.

The Flame Emperor said, “You’re planning to give them a chance?” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Nodding her head, the Empress replied, “The White, Black, and Sword Emperors were confident Flower Burial could defeat me. So, I’ll allow him to challenge me at the ceremony. I also want to see the strength of someone chosen by the Iris Sword Saint and Southern Emperor.”

The Empress was a prideful person, and she naturally wouldn’t accept Lin Yun, not to mention that she was furious with the White and Black Emperors’ betrayal.

“They’re making it seem like I’m the bad person when it was a mess the Southern Emperor left behind. Without me, would Kunlun Realm have lasted till now?” The Empress said coldly with reluctance on her face. She still couldn’t accept that the Southern Emperor gave up everything for a dead person.

“Since he made his choice, I’ll give him this chance. I want to see what’s so impressive about his chosen person!” The Empress said coldly.

The Blade and Flame Emperors said nothing because they knew that the Empress was talking about the Southern Emperor, and it was the Southern Emperor who chose Lin Yun.

“But what if...” The Blade Emperor hesitated with a hint of worry in his eyes.

“If I lost, I could give up the entire world and guard his tomb for the rest of my life. Consider it paying the sins I did in the past,” the Empress replied.

“I’ll be with you!” The Blade Emperor said.

The Empress glanced at the Blade Emperor and disappeared on the throne, saying nothing.

The Flame Emperor finally couldn’t stand it any longer, and he said, “She wants to guard the Southern Emperor’s tomb. Why are you going there for?”

The Blade Emperor’s face turned red, and he argued, “Can’t I guard the Southern Emperor’s tomb as well? Furthermore...what does it have to do with you?”

The Blade Emperor soon left, not willing to stay for another moment.
