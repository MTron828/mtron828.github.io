Chapter 2151 - Friends

The Dao Yang Holy Son was being overbearing, demanding He Xuanjing to jump down the dragon mountains, not wanting to give him the opportunity to leave his name on the Blue Dragon Record.

This made the corner of He Xuanjing’s lips twitch with his face changing. He was furious, but was suppressing his anger. He was someone who had grasped a Sovereign Dao, and he could easily defeat all of the geniuses from the Eastern Desolation before competing for the champion of the Blue Dragon Record with blade dao. But he never expected to be defeated by the Dao Yang Holy Son even before the final fight arrived.

“It looks like I have to personally make a move myself.” A cold light flashed within the Dao Yang Holy Son’s eyes as he walked over.

“No need. I can do it myself. I have at least this much courage since I lost.” He Xuanjing looked at the approaching Dao Yang Holy Son. He knew that he couldn’t avoid his fate of leaving the dragon mountains today. He was just laughing at Mu Quanjing earlier, but he never expected that he would follow right behind the latter. But the latter voluntarily jumped off of the dragon mountain while he was being forced to do so.

He Xuanjing laughed at himself before jumping off the Dragon’s Head, passing through the layer of clouds under the dragon aura and landed on the ground with a bang. The impact made him throw a mouthful of blood with his face becoming ugly.

He Xuanjing struggled to get back on his feet, but it wasn’t easy since he was heavily injured. When he raised his head, he saw a familiar figure, Mu Qianjue.

Mu Qianjue was seated with a calm expression, having recovered from most of his injuries. He opened his eyes and looked at He Xuanjing with a playful smile before he said, “You’re here?”

He Xuanjing’s face changed and became furious.

Mu Qianjue said indifferently, “I had guessed that you would be defeated, but I didn’t expect you to be defeated by the Dao Yang Holy Son instead of Ye Qingtian. The scenery here is great, so you can stay here and enjoy it yourself. I’ll be taking my leave.”

Mu Qianjue turned around and left. But after taking a few steps out, he turned around and smiled, “Oh, right. Your current state is even more pathetic than a dog. At least a dog can still crawl up, while you can only lie on the ground.”

His words made He Xuanjing throw out a mouthful of blood before he slammed his fist on the ground. It turned out that Mu Qianjue had been here waiting for this moment to return the embarrassment to him.

As noon approached, the battles for the champion of each dragon mountain gradually came to an end. As for the Blue Dragon Path’s throne, it was won by Gu Xiyan, the Champion of the First Heavenly Path.

Situ Yan, the champion of the Third Heavenly Path was unfortunate to be heavily injured under the siege from so many holy land geniuses, and could only have a spot at the Dragon’s Claw.

There was also an outcome on the Golden Dragon, White Dragon, Green Dragon, Red Dragon, and Silver Dragon Paths. The various thrones already had their owners, and they were either Champions of Heavenly Paths or a holy land’s holy son. They shone brightly while enjoying the gazes from the surroundings.

Everyone had a cold expression while preparing for the final battle. After the battle for the thrones was over, there would be another battle to determine the champion of the Blue Dragon Record. So now, all of the dragon paths’ thrones had their owner except the Azure Dragon Path.

After the Dao Yang Holy Son defeated He Xuanjing, he wasn’t in a hurry to sit on the throne but turned to look at Lin Yun. This was because only Ye Qingtian still had the ability to compete for the throne on the Dragon’s Head. He smiled, “Ye Qingtian, it’s your turn now. It’s time for us to have an official fight between us.”

“It’s not necessary. We can spar after everything comes to an end, so you can have the throne instead,” Lin Yun smiled. He had already made up his mind earlier. If the Dao Yang Holy Son could defeat He Xuanjing, he wouldn’t compete with the Dao Yang Holy Son for the throne, and his journey in the Blue Dragon Record would come to an end here.

But if the Dao Yang Holy Son was defeated, he would make a move to compete for the Azure Dragon Path’s throne. Now that the Dao Yang Holy Son won, there was no need for him to compete for the throne. After all, it wouldn’t be good if he did his best, and it would be a form of disrespect if he didn’t give it his all. So he might as well generously let the Dao Yang Holy Son have the throne, allowing the Dao Yang Holy Son to prepare for the final battle.

Lin Yun had stayed in the Heavenly Dao Sect for a year, and he received a lot of help from the sect during his time there. He couldn’t repay the Heavenly Dao Sect much, not to mention that he had also declined the Dao Yang Holy Son’s offer to become a holy son. So he decided to let the Dao Yang Holy Son have the throne as a form of repayment.

After all, the Dao Yang Holy Son was someone who wanted to bear ‘heavenly dao’ on his shoulders, and the throne was more important to the Dao Yang Holy Son than to Lin Yun, who already had enough opportunities.

The Dao Yang Holy Son said, “There’s no need to be so pretentious between fellow disciples. It doesn't matter if any of us loses because it will still belong to our Heavenly Dao Sect.”

Lin Yun blinked, and smiled, “I’m not being pretentious. Since I can give up two thrones for two women, why can’t I give up another throne for a man?”

The moment he said that, Lin Yun felt that something wasn’t right, but it was already too late for him to take it back.

The Dao Yang Holy Son’s smile froze on his face when he heard that. A long time later, he smiled, “People call you the Holy Maiden Killer, but it looks like I have underestimated you. It looks like you’re not letting go of holy sons as well.”

Lin Yun’s smile also froze because he didn’t mean that.

“Alright, I won’t be polite with you, then.” The Dao Yang Holy Son sat on the throne, and he smiled, “Speaking of which, I’m starting to take a fancy to you now.”

Lin Yun wore a bitter smile because he knew that he couldn’t explain himself now. He only hoped that Su Ziyao wasn’t around. He could still explain about the women, but he wouldn’t be able to explain the men.

Bai Shuying and Xin Yan looked at Lin Yun weirdly as well.

“Don’t misunderstand. This is just a pure friendship between men,” Lin Yun explained.

Ji Zixi smiled, “Don’t bother explaining. Or are you going to say that the Dao Yang Holy Son isn’t worthy of you?”

“That’s not what I mean…” Lin Yun felt terrible.

“Haha. I know, you two look like a good match.” Ji Zixi looked at the anxious Ye Qingtian and found this person rather interesting.

Lin Yun bitterly smiled, “I didn’t notice that the little princess likes to joke around. If I had known, I would’ve let you sleep a while longer.”

“Don’t call me 'little princess'! If you call me that again, don’t blame me!” Ji Zixi said furiously.

Lin Yun smiled because it was easy to deal with Ji Zixi since she had a weakness.

When the competition on the nine dragon mountains came to an end, Lin Yun and everyone else retreated to the Dragon’s Claw.

Mu Xueling was rather disappointed when she saw this scene. The official from the Divine Dragon Empire beside her spoke up, “Let’s start with the next round.”

Mu Xueling nodded. But just when she was about to make an announcement, a demonic cloud began to approach the nine dragon mountains. The demonic clouds were a few hundred miles away, but everyone could sense the baleful aura, even from such a great distance.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Is it too late for me to participate in the Blue Dragon Record now?” A laughter echoed as a youth appeared on the demonic clouds, donning a silver battle armour. This was a stunning youth with flawless features. His eyebrows were slightly protruded, his eyes sunken in, looking sickly. He also had a vertical silver mark on his forehead that made him seem noble.

Lin Yun frowned since he was familiar with this mark. He exclaimed, “The Demonspirit Clan? A Silver-Eyed Demonspirit?”

When the youth heard Lin Yun’s words, he smiled, “Not bad. You have some eyesight, and I’m from the noble Spirit Clan!”

The Demonspirit Clan called themselves Spirit Clan, and the ‘demon’ in front of it was given by cultivators from the Kunlun Realm.

Outside the dragon mountains, everyone’s faces changed as they retreated. The Demonspirit Clan was infamous throughout the Kunlun Realm. After all, they enslaved multiple large races during the Dark Era, reducing many cultivators to livestock.

Even after three thousand years, there were many legends revolving around the Demonspirit Clan. There were rumors that the seal on the God Burial Mountain Range had lifted, and Quasi-Saint experts could even enter. So many Demonspirit Clans were even seen there.

But no one took that seriously because the Demonspirit Clan was already in the past and was wiped by the Nine Emperors three thousand years ago. The God Burial Mountain Range was a seal that repelled their entrance. They no longer had a spot in this world, and they would maintain a low profile even if they came out. But no one expected that they would dare to come to the Blue Dragon Record.

“Long live the divine cult as long as the holy flame burns!” A roar echoed throughout the nine mountains as a youth donning an indigo robe appeared on the demonic clouds. Descending beside the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit.

“Gu Xinyu, your movement technique is a little too lacking. I’ll grant you a movement technique of my Spirit Clan in the future,” the Silver-Eyed Demonspirit smiled.

The indigo-robed youth smiled, “The Spirit Clan’s martial techniques are famous throughout the universe, and I’m honoured to be given one by Brother Tiangu.”

The gaze of Gu Xiyan, who was on the Blue Dragon’s path, fell onto Gu Xinyu. He was surprised and said, “The Blood Moon Sect dares to come to the Blue Dragon Record? Are they courting death?”

The Blood Moon Sect was a massive powerhouse in the Kunlun Realm three thousand years ago, and they could even face the Nine Emperors head-on at their prime. Even the Southern Emperor failed to entirely annihilate the Blood Moon Sect, and they had gradually recovered their strength over the past three thousand years.

They were like rats in the early years, but they had gradually become high-profile in recent years. They have already become the mortal enemy of the Divine Dragon Empire. The demonic dao and demonic cults were the same, it's just that they shared different ideals with no thoughts of overthrowing the Kunlun Realm, so the Divine Dragon Empire could tolerate them. After all, this world wasn’t white and black, there were also some grey spaces in-between.

The Demon Gate was established by the Heartless Emperor back then to recruit the demonic paths if they couldn’t be wiped out, restricting them with some rules. But the Blood Moon Sect was different because they competed with the Nine Emperors three thousand years ago and even colluded with the Demonspirit Clan three thousand years later. This was something the Divine Dragon Empire couldn’t tolerate.

Everyone was shocked when the two mortal enemies of the Divine Dragon Empire appeared and even joined forces. There were long rumors that there was cooperation between the Blood Moon Sect and Demonspirit Clan, but it appeared to be true now. Just the two of them didn’t mean anything, but everyone was shocked that they dared to show up together for the Blue Dragon Record.

Lin Yun’s face changed, and he finally knew why Su Ziyao would show up for the Blue Dragon Record. He began to look around, trying to find Su Ziyao’s figure.

“How dare you!” A roar disrupted Lin Yun’s thoughts as Mu Xueling roared. She also gave off a terrifying aura, and the official beside her naturally couldn’t tolerate the existence of the Blood Moon Sect and Demonspirit Clan at the Blue Dragon Record, either.

They didn’t bother finding an excuse as they immediately made a move, unleashing a gigantic golden dragon claw at Gu Xinyu and Tian Gu.

But Gu Xinyu and Tian Gu calmly stood on the demonic clouds, not having any panic on their faces. When the claw was about to descend, a silver demonic eye appeared above them. The eye was over ten feet, rumbling with a demonic aura before shooting a beam of light to shatter the dragon claw.

Simultaneously, a crimson moon hung high in the sky as a cold voice came from the moon, “The ancestor of my clan was a friend of the Ancestral Deity back during the Blue Dragon Banquet. Why are you guys so petty now?”
