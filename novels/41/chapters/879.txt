Chapter 880 - Calm Down

The phenomenon caused by two sword sutras making a breakthrough and merging left many people shocked. More accurately, it looked like the Azure Firmament Sword Sutra had supplemented the Iris Sword Sutra’s flaw.

On the glossy tree, the petals from the Iris Sword Sutra were shining brightly like stars. The branches were like peerless swords and the petals were made of sword aura.

At this moment, an ice phoenix flew around the Azure Firmament Tree and shouted. Turning into flames, the phoenix showered the tree with fire. It was the Violet Frost Phoenix that Lin Yun summoned through the sword array after reaching the thirteenth stage. The phoenix could make the entire tree grow.

In the blink of an eye, the tree had grown nearly 300 meters. The Iris Sword Sutra was truly unfathomable. All of a sudden, Lin Yun was reminded of something. Upon reaching a high stage, one could refine the Iris Sacred Flame. After reaching completion, he could refine the sword box with the Iris Sacred Flame and receive the inheritance left behind by the Iris Sword Saint.

“What was that?”

“Did Flower Burial Lin Yun finish his seclusion?”

“That phenomenon was created by his cultivation technique. Holy shit, just what grade is it?” Everyone in the city was shocked by the terrifying pressure from the phenomon.

“My sword intent seems to have improved,” muttered Lin Yun, but he wasn’t too surprised. The improvement of his sword intent came from his comprehension in sword sutras and sword techniques. On top of that, the combination of the two sword sutras was more terrifying than an overlord fortune sword sutra. Even if his spiritual sword intent didn’t want to improve, it would.

“Perhaps I can give it a try…” Lin Yun’s eyes flickered and he fell into deep thoughts as he looked at the dracophant head. Previously, he could sense an invisible barrier suppressing him. But with the improvement of his sword intent and the Azure Firmament Tree, the barrier broke like a piece of paper.

“I still have to temper my sword intent through life and death experiences. My spiritual sword intent has reached the pinnacle of greater mastery. It’s hard to make an improvement relying on sword sutra…” Lin Yun processed his thoughts quickly. The reason why he could grasp the spiritual sword intent in the Profound Amber Realm wasn’t because he relied on the Iris Sword Sutra. Ultimately, he had relied on himself.

Lin Yun decided to take a gamble. Under everyone’s shock, he landed on the dracophant’s head. Then, a shattering sound could be heard throughout every corner of the city.

“Not good!” Fang Shaoyu’s face changed because Lin Yun went against his advice.

When Lin Yun stepped onto the dracophant’s head, it felt as though he had entered an entirely different realm. At the same time, everyone was shocked to discover that the barrier enveloping the entire city had also disappeared. With that, darkness enveloped every corner of the city.

When they raised their heads, they could see the demonic clouds descending from the sky. In that split second, the city felt no different from the outside. Suddenly, countless black lightning began to flash in the sky and a terrifying demonic aura headed for Lin Yun.

“This…” Fang Shaoyu’s face became grave because those who landed on the head would have the face of the corrosion of the demonic aura in the sky. Furthermore, the dracophant’s head was like a spatial lock that sealed off Lin Yun’s sword intent. This meant that he had to take the lightning head-on. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Just when everyone thought that Lin Yun would be killed by the black lightning, a dazzling brilliance burst out in the city. Lin Yun’s sword intent broke through the seal as the Azure Firmament Tree bloomed behind him. Then, his sword intent enveloped the entire city, which prevented the assault of the demonic aura.

His Immortal Azure Dragon Sword Intent clashed with the lightning manifested by demonic aura. Each collision made the city seem like it was about to be destroyed. So much so that at many times, Lin Yun’s sword intent would crumble from the lightning and the tree would lose its luster. But whenever that happened, the sword rays would shine brightly once more and block the lightning from descending. No one could see what Lin Yun looked like on the dragon head, but they could imagine his pale face.

“Holy shit, this feels like the tribulation for the first soul of the Heavenly Soul Realm.” Fang Shaoyu, Zhu Qingshan, and Zhao Chen were shocked, but there was nothing they could do to help Lin Yun. As for the other cultivators in the city, they feared that they would be implicated by Lin Yun’s actions and would have to fight the black lightning.

The terrifying event finally disappeared after the morning arrived. At this moment, Lin Yun’s aura was extremely weak. His sword intent that enveloped the entire city had disappeared and it seemed like Lin Yun had lost his life to the lightning bolts.

Fang Shaoyu, Zhu Qingshan, and Zhao Chen felt anxious, but none of them dared to move. Even when the sun hung high in the sky, Lin Yun still hadn’t moved.

Right at this moment, three figures landed on the city wall. They covered the city with their Heavenly Soul Realm aura. “They’re from the Flamecloud Realm!”

“They’re finally here! They must be here for Lin Yun!”

“There’s no way the Flamecloud Realm can suffer a loss to Lin Yun without responding. But why are those three here?” The cultivators in the city instantly recognized the newcomers on the city wall.

“I heard that the brat is in seclusion on the pillar. He’s pretty bold to snatch the territory of my Flamecloud Realm.” The leader of the three looked at the dracophant pillar with killing aura in his eyes.

“This is bad!” Fang Shaoyu’s face changed. “Those three are some of the strongest cultivators from the Flamecloud Realm. They’re only inferior to Feng Xuan. If they work together, they can fight Feng Xuan to a standstill. Nangong He can’t measure up to any of them.”

The leader of the trio was Yan Tie. He was the second strongest from the Flamecloud Realm. His Flamecloud Incinerating Palm had reached a terrifying height and he could use five seals.

While Fang Shaoyu, Zhu Qingshan, and Zhao Chen spoke among themselves, the trio landed 1,000 meters away from the pillar. Yan Tie frowned his brows and said, “There’s clearly a powerful sword intent lingering on the pillar, but why can’t I sense any vitality? You two go check if the brat died. If he is dead, take his body back to Senior Brother Feng.”

“He won’t die that easily. He probably knows that we’re here and hid his aura to launch a sneak attack.”

“That piece of garbage from the Profound Amber Realm is really naive if he thinks he can use a foolish trick against us.” The two standing next to Yan Tie had disdain written on their faces. Clearly, they two knew that Nangong He died because he had underestimated Lin Yun.

“Brother Lin is currently in seclusion. It’s best if you guys don’t interrupt him,” said Fang Shaoyu as he rushed over with Zhao Chen and Zhu Qingshan. Although the three were already at their limit in the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm, they were nothing before the Flamecloud Realm. They didn’t even make their breakthrough, but they still chose to stop the Flamecloud Realm.

Right now, they could only wait as there were only two outcomes. Lin Yun would either never wake up or he would undergo a transformation after he wakes up. They all believed that the possibility of the latter was high, so they wanted to buy time for Lin Yun.

“It looks like something really happened to Lin Yun. The two of you go up and cripple him. I’ll deal with these three here.” Yan Tie’s venomous gaze fell onto Fang Shaoyu, Zhu Qingshan and Zhao Chen.

Hearing that, the faces of Fang Shaoyu, Zhu Qingshan and Zhao Chen changed because Yan Tie had seen through their thoughts instantly. Fang Shaoyu’s gaze became cold and his origin energy fluctuated. He would stop the Flamecloud Realm at all cost. “Screw it, stop them no matter what!”

“Brother Fang, calm down. Let me welcome these guests.” Right at this moment, a voice sounded out that brought joy to Fang Shaoyu, Zhu Qingshan and Zhao Chen. Lin Yun had woken up!

“Not dead? Even better. After all, Senior Brother Feng instructed us to bring you back alive.” Yan Tie and his two buddies were briefly stunned before they smiled. But when they raised their heads, they were completely dumbfounded.

Lin Yun was standing on the dracophant’s head, shocking them to their core. After all, how could someone possibly stand on the dracophant’s head?
