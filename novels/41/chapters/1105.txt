Chapter 1106 - No Paths

Everyone in the Flying Cloud Palace was anxiously waiting while several figures flew towards the sky. Not long later, they arrived before the sect master who was bearing the pressure of the Sword Saint Mountain.

“Sect Master, Lin Yun made it through the ninth test.” An elder spoke out nervously with excitement flashing in his pupils. His heart throbbed violently at Lin Yun’s speed. After all, Ye Ziling took three days to reach the ninth test.

“I know,” replied the sect master with a composed face, but the flickers in his eyes betrayed him.

“Some elders want to enter and take a look at what’s going on, but none of them are able to enter,” said another elder.

“Ignore it,” replied the sect master.

The elders nodded their heads, but one elder couldn’t help asking, “Sect Master, will Lin Yun really be able to reach the peak?”

After all, they knew that Lin Yun had an ongoing bet with Ye Ziling. Back then, the elders merely smiled because Lin Yun didn’t know how terrifying Sword Saint Mountain was. But now, they were worried that Lin Yun would really be able to ascend the peak.

“Sect Master, has anyone made it to the peak before?” Another elder asked curiously. It had been two millennia since anyone made it to the peak, but the elders didn’t know if the records were real. After all, the history of the Sword Saint Mountain was even longer than the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect.

The Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect was a subsidiary force of the Sword Sect, and this mountain existed before the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect existed. The Sword Saint Mountain was a treasured sword in the Profound Azure Manor with many sects eyeing it because it had many secrets.

“No one from the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect has,” said the sect master.

The elders were shocked when they heard that. After all, the sect master said that no one from the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect ascended the peak. Did that mean that someone who wasn’t from the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect made it to the top?

“Lin Yun still can’t reach the top. You guys go down and wait for now,” instructed the sect master.

Still can’t reach the top? This made the elders curious about the sect master’s confidence, but they didn’t pry. Instead, they bowed and left.

“That brat is really surprising!” The sect master muttered while he looked at the Sword Saint Mountain. He was trying to capture the boundless sword ray in his eyes, but he couldn’t see past the layer of fog that enveloped the mountain.

He could sense some changes on Sword Saint Mountain, which meant that Lin Yun discovered a secret of the mountain. However, there was also the possibility that Lin Yun used another method to make it through the ninth test. Either way, the next three tests weren’t going to be easy for Lin Yun.

Back in the Sword Saint Mountain, Lin Yun spent an hour on the tenth test before he passed. With that, Lin Yun had obtained ten of the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords. Now, he only had three more to go.

“Master, the last three tests are next, but we can’t follow you anymore.” Ten stone statues spoke as they stood before Lin Yun respectfully.

This instantly extinguished Lin Yun’s joy. He had memorized all the verses up until and he was only lacking the crucial part. If he couldn’t get the crucial part, he wouldn’t be able to cultivate the technique. All ten verses would go to waste. Furthermore, this would mean that he could only obtain ten of the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords.

Although it was impressive since Ye Ziling only made it through the ninth test, Lin Yun couldn’t accept an outcome where he didn’t ascend the peak. It was fine if he didn’t see the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sutra, but now that he had seen it, he was sure that the sword technique and sword sutra had to be practiced together.

“The person in the painting instructed you guys to follow me,” smiled Lin Yun. It was great having ten statues open the path for him, and Lin Yun didn’t want to end it here.

“We’re already at the end, and this is how high the mountain goes,” said a stone statue.

“Wait, aren't there three more tests? We’re still far from ascending the mountain,” argued Lin Yun.

“This is how far the mountain goes.” The stone statues were still respectful to Lin Yun, but they were pretty certain that this was how far the mountain went.

Lin Yun began to ponder before he replied, “Alright then. Thank you for all your help so far. I’ll continue the journey myself.”

After the stone statues left, Lin Yun’s thoughts flashed quickly because he knew that someone else had also made it to the tenth test like him a few centuries ago. It was also recorded in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect that the tenth test was the highest level and that there was no path above it. At least, no one in the last millennium knew of a higher level.

At the same time, he pondered the words of the stone statues. He could clearly tell that the mountain didn’t stop here.

“I should keep walking.” Lin Yun gathered his thoughts and walked forward, but the path disappeared as soon as he walked. The path was instantly replaced with a cliff. Lin Yun felt a chill run down his spine as he saw the air of death all around him. He was so terrified that he had to retreat.

“What’s going on?” Lin Yun’s face turned pale because he would have fallen off the cliff if he moved faster. Just thinking about it sent shivers through his body. When Lin Yun raised his head, the path towards the peak looked illusory.

Lin Yun picked up a pebble and threw it at the path. The pebble bounced off the path before stopping. Clearly, the path was real despite disappearing whenever Lin Yun tried to walk on it.

“Is that an illusion?” Lin Yun rubbed his chin and took a step forward. The cliff appeared before him once more, and he was sure that it wasn’t an illusion. At this moment, he understood why no one ascended the peak.

No wonder many people lost the courage to keep going. It looks like I boasted a little too much… How am I supposed to go up? Lin Yun knew that if he went back, Ye Ziling would definitely laugh at him. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

The thought of this riled up his fighting spirits and made him fall into deep thoughts. But right at this moment, Lil’ Purple’s voice sounded out from the sword box, “Lin Yun, what are you afraid of? With me around, you don’t have to worry that you’ll die.”

“If you’re that strong, why don’t you come out and walk in front of me? I’ll follow behind.” Lin Yun smiled.

“Hmph, why should I!” Lil’ Purple raised her head proudly.

Hearing that, Lin Yun smiled because he knew that Lil’ Purple was boasting again. Ignoring Lil’ Purple, Lin Yun tried a few times again and failed. He was sure that he would die a terrible death if he took another step forward. This was no longer an issue about his courage. If one only needed to be courageous, there would have been many people who reached the peak.

There were many geniuses who weren’t afraid of death, but the mountain wasn’t that simple.

“I must’ve missed something…” Lin Yun pondered.

“What did I miss?” Lin Yun smiled bitterly. It looks like the mountain was harder than comprehending the Sword of the Beginning. Although it was dangerous back then, he could still turn back if he wanted. But this time, there would be no turning back if he took a step forward.

“I think it’s time to go down…” Lin Yun turned around as his gaze lingered on the path for a long time. Perhaps he might be able to uncover the secrets here after reaching the Empyrean Realm. Then again, he really found it a pity to give up here when he already made it this far. Letting out a sigh, Lin Yun shook his head and left.

At the same time, everyone in the Flying Cloud Palace looked at the ten Azure Birds flying around Sword Saint Mountain with shock on their faces. After all, this was the highest record in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sutra in the past millennium.

“What’s a genius? That is a genius!”

“He entered the sect officially and made it to the tenth test on the first try. No one can really compare to him.”

“He’s too strong!” Lin Yun’s performance fully convinced the disciples. But as time passed without any additional phenomena, everyone knew that Lin Yun was stuck. It was like the previous genius a few centuries ago who got stuck on the eleventh test.

But this time, no one uttered a word. If Lin Yun couldn’t make it through the last three tests even with his aptitude, no one would be able to ascend the peak.

“Senior Sister, Lin Yun is stuck at the eleventh test.” Wang Yuruo ran over in excitement.

“As expected. After all, no one has made it through the last three tests,” replied Ye Ziling,

“Why?” Wang Yuruo asked. Her words made the nearby disciples grow quiet. They were quietly waiting for Ye Ziling’s explanation. After all, she was the sect master's daughter, and she might know some secrets about the Sword Saint Mountain.

Ye Ziling didn’t hide it from her and replied, “The Sword Sect’s disciple who made it to the tenth test seven centuries ago left some notes behind. I looked through them before. He said that there is no path after the tenth test. It might seem like a path, but it’s actually a deadly cliff. The tenth test is where everything ends.”

The crowd was shocked that Sword Saint Mountain had such a huge secret.

“Then won’t Senior Sister win the bet with Senior Brother Yun?” Wang Yuruo pouted her lips.

“You think I’ll make a bet on something that I’m not confident in? After all, I have to agree to any request if I lose,” replied Ye Ziling.

“Actually, it doesn’t really matter. With how outstanding Senior Brother Yun is, he’s definitely a perfect match for you.” Wang Yuruo spoke cheerfully to Ye Ziling.

“What are you thinking? Why don’t I give you to him instead?” Ye Ziling glared at Wang Yuruo.

Hearing that, Wang Yuruo lowered her red face, “I-I’m still young…”

Knocking on Wang Yuruo’s head, Ye Ziling said, “You really took that seriously? I’m warning you to distance yourself from him or you won’t even know how you got sold. He’ll definitely lose this bet, and it’ll make him behave for some time.”

“It hurts!” Wang Yuruo held onto her head. Those who were nearby clicked their tongues. After all, Lin Yun had just come to the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, and he nearly conquered two of their beauties.

It didn’t take long for Lin Yun to reach the foot of the mountain. When he arrived at the first test, the stone statue bowed to Lin Yun. Looking at the stone statue, Lin Yun smiled before he continued forward. But just when he was about to leave the mountain, he suddenly came to a stop. He finally found what he missed when he saw the stone statue bowing to him.

“Hahaha!” Lin Yun laughed and smacked the back of his head happily, “I’m really a genius!”

“Lin Yun, why are you hitting yourself? Have you become stupid?” Lil’ Purple chuckled.

“Hehe, just wait and see!” Lin Yun climbed the mountain once more. This time, he would ascend the mountain!
