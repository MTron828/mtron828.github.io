Chapter 1308 - Heaven Burial (2)

But just when it was about to disappear completely, a draconic roar resounded from the abyss. The roar naturally came from Lin Yun’s second sword soul and turned into a streak of light that charged at the ‘broken sword’.

When the ‘broken sword’ saw that the azure dragon sword soul was so furious, it instantly became furious as well. When the golden azure dragon approached, cracks began to spread over its body. But the short delay allowed the golden human to grab onto the hilt of the ‘broken sword’. When the golden human grabbed onto the sword hilt, the eight ominous souls that were wreaking havoc within his body calmed down.

But that wasn’t all. Lin Yun released a roar and controlled the golden human to draw the sword hilt out by half an inch. When the sword ray was unleashed, the eight ominous souls were instantly turned into ashes and flew out from his pores. This was simply too terrifying, and the power of the ‘broken sword’ was so terrifying that it left Lin Yun completely dumbfounded.

When the fragments of the ominous souls merged with the fresh blood that was on the summit of the mountain, an explosive, boundless aura was made, making it feel sacred. Lin Yun had drawn the ‘broken sword’ out by an inch with the determination to die if he fails, and he had accomplished something unprecedented.

It felt as though he wasn’t holding onto a sword, but an entire world. The terrifying power coming from the sword made his scalp go numb. At the same time, countless ancient fragments of information began to pour into his mind; he knew that it was time.

“Don’t worry about me. I’m fine,” said Lin Yun as he stood up and gave Lil’ Purple a smile. When Lil’ Purple heard his response, she burst into a smile as she covered her mouth. This was because she was simply too emotional at this moment.

Lin Yun’s body was shaking to the point that he could collapse at any moment, but he still threw out a punch. Boundless astral energy poured out with his punch that rose like a bright sun, radiating the thirty-six layers of heaven.

Raising his head, he could see the Azure Dragon, Vermillion Bird, White Tiger, and Black Tortoise Constellations, the four eternal constellations through the thirty-six layers of heavens. Shortly after, he could see a hundred Sovereign Constellations. Those sovereign constellations were shining brightly as they lit up the entire cosmos.

Aside from that, there were still countless other constellations. There were too many of them, but all of them were outshone by the hundred Sovereign Constellations.

The hundred Sovereign Constellations were massive, and there was a star at the core of those constellations. Simultaneously, those constellations were shining with different lights, there were those who were elegant, those who were enveloped in a demonic aura, and also those that appeared perfect and flawless.

He could hear their mutters filled with disdain for him, asking him to immediately stop or he would lose his life. A hundred Sovereign Constellations didn’t mean that only a hundred sovereigns had been born. Each Sovereign Constellation had an heir, such as Lin Yun could succeed in the Heaven Subduing Constellation if he wanted.

Those Sovereign Constellations contained the remnant will of those sovereigns, and they could feel what Lin Yun was trying to do.

“How dare you provoke us!”

“You’re courting death!”

“The pride of a sovereign cannot be violated! Stop immediately!”

“Carry on and you’ll only lose your life!”

But Lin Yun merely smiled with a hint of disdain, reluctant to give up when he heard that. “I’ve always believed that nothing is impossible as long as you have the will to take the step out!” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

When he waved his hands together, the blood became mixed with the fragments of the ominous souls and dissolved into ink. Lin Yun then began to paint a Sovereign Constellation that solely belonged to him.

Along with a loud sound, a golden canvas unfolded and Lin Yun waved his hands like he was wielding a brush. Just like that, Lin Yun painted an ancient Winged Dragon stroke by stroke on the canvas.

This was a shocking painting because every single brush was filled with boundless vitality. Lin Yun’s eyes had turned bloodshot with his hair wildly fluttering about. When he had successfully painted the Winged Dragon, he briefly paused before closing his eyes and falling into deep thoughts.

When the golden human within his body held onto the ‘broken sword’, lots of information began to appear within Lin Yun’s mind, and all of it was about the eight ominous souls. When he reopened his eyes, they were shining brightly as he wrote a phrase on the painting. When he was done writing the phrase, the first painting was completed.

When Lil’ Purple looked at the phrase, she slowly recited it with her face changed. “Slicing through the primeval chaos on the summit of Kunlun, unleashing great prowess as the sun rises.”

The hundred Sovereign Constellations above the thirty-sixth layer of heaven were comparable to naturally-born constellations, and they appeared as though they would exist for eternity.

Bearing the huge pressure, Lin Yun began to create the second painting. This time, it was the ancient Flying Serpent, and when he was done, he left behind a phrase, just like he did with the first painting, “The phantom of the Flying Serpent bewitches all, disrupting both the circulation of stars and directions.”

Lin Yun continued to paint, while Lil’ Purple would read the phrases he left behind. The more she read, the more shocked she became.

“With a pair of eyes like the sun and moon, freezing all of eternity with one thought.” That was the phrase of the Aurora Dragon painting.

“Looking back in the nine nethers, not even deities and gods would dare to look directly.” That was the phrase of the Demonic Phoenix painting.

The descriptions on the paintings were too terrifying. Lil’ Purple had survived through the ancient era, so she knew what those phrases meant, and each of those words contained boundless might.

“Kunpeng rises with the wind like the sun, soaring straight to the nine heavens.”

“Qiongqi’s might sets the world, annihilating everything along with Yin and Yang.”

“With the appearance of the Nether Spirit, one of the four seasons would disappear before it.”

“Born before the primeval chaos was formed, and annihilating divine dragons with a single breath.” It didn’t take long for Lin Yun to complete the remaining four paintings that represented Kunpeng, Qiongqi, Nether Spirit, and the Ghoul Null as he splashed his ink.

The eight paintings looked like they were made of gold as they hovered around Lin Yun. The phrases on each of the paintings wasn’t dazzling, but they seemed to contain boundless might that firmly suppressed the eight ominous souls that had been turned into constellations.

“Just one more left…” Lin Yun continued with his constellation, using his blood, vitality, and ominous souls as ink and his firmament sword intent as a brush. If he wasn’t careful, then his spirit would be ignited until he was extinguished.

But Lin Yun knew that he needed to take one more step out if he wanted to form a Sovereign Constellation. He needed one sword to suppress the eight ominous souls, and that sword could also allow him to wield the power of the eight ominous souls and unleash the might to bury the heavens.

When the ninth canvas unfolded, Lin Yun threw out a mouthful of blood on the canvas. Cracks also began to appear on his body with blood flowing out. He was creating one star after another on the canvas. At this moment, he was painting the entire cosmos.

His entire body was swaying because he was reaching his limit. When the brush flew, the outline of the cosmos was complete. But what he was about to do next was the final stroke on the painting.

As the light shone from his pupils, the two sword souls in the center of his brows emitted a boundless sword intent. Behind this brush, Lin Yun poured all of his spirit, aura, and essence. At the same time, the pressure from the Sovereign Constellations beyond the thirty-six layers of heaven continued to press down on him.

But Lin Yun didn’t care about the pressure. A long time later, a sword hanging above the thirty-six layers of heaven was formed. When the nine paintings were combined together, the initial state of Lin Yun’s Sovereign Constellation was finally formed.

When he relaxed, the complete Heaven Burial Constellation entered his body. Upon entry, boundless vitality began to nourish Lin Yun’s aura, and a terrifying aura began to rise. At this moment, his vitality and physique were undergoing an unprecedented transformation, and he also emitted an unrivaled aura that belonged to him, Flower Burial!
