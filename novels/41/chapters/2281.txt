Chapter 2282 - Enemies

A dragon’s roar echoed from within Lin Yun’s body as he gave off a dragon aura, injecting the condensed blood that was in his palm into the Flame Dragon. The Flame Dragon was as tough as divine iron. There were no traces left of when Lin Yun had been fighting on the skull multiple times earlier.

When Lin Yun poured the Flame Dragon’s blood into the skull, the blood turned into countless threads that began spreading across the skeleton. What Li Feibai and Ji Zixi expected didn’t occur since there wasn’t any movement from the skeleton. The skeleton even began to tremble under the pressure of the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda and showed signs of falling into the collapsed space.

“Lin Yun, are you not going to leave? We will die if we don’t leave quickly,” Li Feibai said as she raised her head. The Heavenly Wheel Pagoda was descending slowly, distorting the surrounding space-time. Even she wasn’t confident that she could leave this place safely.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Big Brother Lin, there will be no time if we stay here. We might have a chance if I use the Divine Phoenix Mirror to try to clear a path,” Ji Zixi said.

Right then, a dragon’s aura spread out from the Flame Dragon’s skeleton as the thick layer of dust on the skeleton began to dissipate. As the dust flew out, the Flame Dragon’s skeleton began to shine like blazing flames as the dragon’s aura that it gave off continued to increase.

The Flame Dragon’s skeleton that was buried here looked like it came to life as the dragon’s aura began moving it like gears. When the skeleton began to move, it caused a huge commotion.

Lin Yun had beads of sweat on his forehead after discovering that he wasn’t just pouring the Flame Dragon’s blood that he had gathered into the skeleton, but also the Dragon’s Blood that was within his body.

The descending Heavenly Wheel Pagoda suddenly felt an obstruction that seemed to be like a barrier, stopping it in mid-air. The invisible dragon’s aura even caused it to tremble.

“Mhm?” Wang Muyan was surprised as she raised her head to look at the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda before lowering her gaze towards Lin Yun. She was surprised that the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda was stopped because she had undone three of the nine seals on the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda, paying a great price.

She didn’t have the time to think as her fingers began shining together, releasing a crimson radiance. Her eyes suddenly became golden with a mysterious golden seal engraved in his eyes.

With a roar, Wang Muyan undid another seal on the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda. As the pagoda gave off an even more powerful aura, its radiance created holes in the sky, with the entire God Burial Mountain Range shaking violently as well. The Heavenly Wheel Pagoda shattered the dragon’s aura and descended once more.

“Not good!” Ji Zixi and Li Feibai’s face changed. But Lin Yun gritted his teeth and held on with no intention of leaving. The Heavenly Wheel Pagoda was like a huge descending mountain, casting a massive shadow on the ground.

Ji Zixi gritted her teeth and clasped her hands, pouring the phoenix saint blood into the Divine Phoenix Mirror.

“I must’ve owed it to you in my previous life. Since you’re not leaving, I’m not going to leave, either,” Li Feibai sighed before her gaze became firm as she spread her arms apart. She released her Sovereign Constellation once more and the lotus in the golden sea flew out from the painting. A Sovereign Constellation and a Sovereign Saint Artifact soared to the sky, charging at the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda.

But Wang Muyan was calm. She might have been afraid if they were outside, but they were in the Heavenly Void, and the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda was invincible here. With a wave of her hand, the space and time seals appeared as time overlapped with the collapsing space. As the two combined, the Sovereign Saint Artifact and Sovereign Constellation lasted briefly before they were suppressed.

Behind Lin Yun, the two women threw out a mouthful of blood.

“Lin Yun, I can spare your life if you lower your head now!” Wang Muyan’s voice came from the sky.

“What are you thinking about?” Lin Yun replied, removing his hand from the Flame Dragon’s skull. When he let go, he felt as though he had lost all his blood and his legs became soft, making him unable to move. Right then, the Flame Dragon returned to life and its massive skeleton moved like a mountain range.

Golden flames also blazed within the eye sockets of the Flame Dragon’s skeleton and a resounding dragon’s roar echoed. When the skull raised its head, it shot out two beams from its eye sockets and struck the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda, sending it flying away.

But that wasn’t all. The Saints within the Flame Dragon Valley realized that the spatial distortion in the surroundings had disappeared. They quickly came to their senses and soared to the sky, releasing their saint radiance.

Before they could respond, Lin Yun yelled at them under the support of the two ladies, “Get on the skeleton!”

Everyone quickly came to their senses and the three hundred-odd Saints rushed over. Lin Yun took a deep breath and waved his hand, taking out the Azure Dragon Saint Blood Pellet. This was the pellet he had refined within his body back when he was training on the Blood Purgatory Mountain. Ye Guhan said that it might be able to save him time in a critical moment, but Lin Yun didn’t expect that he would use it now.

He threw the pellet into his mouth without hesitation and his body felt heated. His blood was swiftly replenished and he soon returned to his peak state. This scene brought joy to Ji Zixi and Li Feibai’s faces.

“Thank you, Flower Burial, for saving us!”

"“Thank you, Flower Burial, for saving us!”"

The surrounding Saints expressed gratitude after landing on the Flame Dragon’s skeleton.

“Let’s go,” Li Feibai said. “If we leave now, she won’t be able to stop us.”

“Not yet. We haven’t taken back the divine flame fragment.” Lin Yun raised his head to look at the shocked Wang Muyan. But she wasn’t injured, so she began forming seals, and the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda started to descend again.

“Great timing!” Lin Yun laughed as he circulated the Azure Dragon Divine Physique on the Flame Dragon’s skull. He could feel his blood boiling. The Flame Dragon’s skeleton seemed to have responded to him since the Flame Dragon’s blood that was within the skeleton ignited.

In ancient times, the Flame Dragon was a pure-blooded true dragon that could fight deities. It wouldn’t allow anyone to step on its pride even if it were left with bones.

As Lin Yun’s heart beat violently, he sensed a strong fighting spirit from the Flame Dragon’s skeleton beneath him. This naturally brought joy to his face as fighting spirit also blazed within his eyes; he could sense that the Flame Dragon’s remains weren’t willing to retreat.

“Let’s fight, then!” Lin Yun roared, feeling like he had become one with the Flame Dragon’s skeleton. The entire Flame Dragon’s skeleton moved as it soared to the sky and fireballs shot out from the collapsed ground. The dragon’s aura stabilized the distorted space and it unleashed a dragon’s breath when it got close.

A golden pillar of flames shot out from the Flame Dragon’s mouth, destroying all the space and time seals that were in the path of the breath. Space and time were powerful but could be destroyed before absolute strength. This time, the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda was sent a hundred miles away, with Wang Muyan throwing out a mouthful of blood and her face becoming pale.

“H-How is this possible?” Zhao Tianyu was dumbfounded when he saw this scene. With four seals lifted from the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda, Wang Muyan should have been invincible.

Lin Yun squinted and locked onto Wang Muyan’s figure amidst the chaos. His eyes lit up, and he didn’t hesitate as he stomped his foot on the Flame Dragon’s skull, charging over to Wang Muyan. “Found you!”

The surrounding was in chaos due to the shattered space, time, and golden flames. But Lin Yun was agile as he shuttled through and sealed off Wang Muyan’s path of retreat.

Wang Muyan’s face was pale. She wanted to join up with the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda, but her face became cold as she furiously said, “Get lost!”

“Hand over the divine flame fragment, and I’ll let you go,” Lin Yun said, his clothes fluttering in the wind.

“I don’t need to hand it over!” Wang Muyan’s face was pale as she decided to make a move. But just when she wanted to make a move, Lin Yun was even faster than her and arrived before Wang Muyan.

The two clashed, but Wang Muyan couldn’t withstand Lin Yun’s attack since she was heavily injured. When Lin Yun swept her gaze towards her chest, Wang Muyan’s face changed. She didn’t hesitate to turn around, wanting to rely on the distorted space-time to escape.

Seeing this, Lin Yun no longer held back and restrained Wang Muyan with his sword aura before pushing his palm against her chest. When a certain restriction shattered, dazzling flames gushed out from her chest.

“It’s here,” Lin Yun muttered. He held back in his fight with Wang Muyan earlier because he wanted to find out where she had hidden the divine flame fragment. His guess was right. Wang Muyan had hidden the divine flame fragment in her chest so that he couldn’t find it.

When the divine flame fragment broke free from Wang Muyan’s chest, it left behind a sinister wound and blood was gushing out, distorting Wang Muyan’s face from the pain.

Lin Yun didn’t hesitate to reach out and grab the divine flame fragment before executing the Azure Dragon’s Grasp, pouring his saint aura into his hand to restrain the divine flame fragment.

“Ye Qingtian, we are no longer friends starting today. I won’t hold back against you if we meet again in the future,” Wang Muyan fled as she furiously looked at Lin Yun. Her wound hurts, but her heart hurts even more. In the future, they would only be enemies.

When Lin Yun raised his head and saw Wang Muyan’s gaze, he was stunned before he turned around, pausing briefly before leaving. This meant that they would only be enemies the next time they met.
