Chapter 2448 - The End of Tian Xuanzi (2)

But in the critical moment, a dazzling saint radiance shone from Lin Yun and the Firmament Saint Cloth was activated. This enveloped Lin Yun in saint radiance that made him look hazy. Multiple light spheres also appeared around the Firmament Saint Cloth, and each sphere represented a small realm with people living in it.

Empowered by the Firmament Saint Cloth, the aura that Lin Yun gave off began to rise, soon reaching the height of a Great Saint. With that, the disadvantage in Lin Yun’s cultivation was resolved, and he even suppressed Tian Xuanzi in terms of cultivation now.

Borrowing the power of the Firmament Saint Cloth, Lin Yun pushed his palm forward. Scarlet Firmament Peak was fine when the two palms collided, but the other mountains were heavily damaged and became shorter.

Tian Xuanzi returned to the Golden-Purple Dragon Throne and said, “That’s more like it.”

But Lin Yun didn’t dare to be careless and clashed with him once more. This time, they fell into a life-and-death battle with an intense fight. No one could interfere in their fight, and they retreated instead.

Even when donning the Firmament Saint Cloth, it didn’t feel great when Lin Yun took the Profound Sky Universe head-on. The Firmament Saint Cloth wasn’t invincible and could only bring Lin Yun to the same level as Tian Xuanzi. If he wanted to kill the latter, he would have to find his flaw and moment before Tian Xuanzi alternated between reality and imaginary, which wasn’t easy.

There were restraints to Tian Xuanzi using it, but that didn’t make it any better. More importantly, Tian Xuanzi also sensed Lin Yun’s thoughts and purposely revealed a flaw numerous times, wanting to lure Lin Yun to take the bait.

This made the Divine Phoenix Holy Master’s scalp numb because Tian Xuanzi was tough to deal with. Even with his information, Lin Yun was struggling to deal with Tian Xuanzi and was at a disadvantage throughout the fight.

But this didn’t make the Great Saints from Profound Sky Sect’s faction feel relieved because of the sword aura that Lin Yun was releasing. Facing Tian Xuanzi’s attacks, Lin Yun’s sword intent kept trying to break through the shackles of the eighth-grade sword intent. They feared he would achieve the legendary ninth-grade sword intent, the Heaven Desolate Sword Intent.

It would be terrifying if that happened and what they feared the most came true. When the radiance released by the Firmament Saint Cloth began to dim down, Lin Yun’s sword intent reached the Heaven Desolate Sword Intent that soared to the sky, making the stars dim in comparison as everyone fell silent, looking at the dazzling sword intent.

“Three thousand Greater Daos, but only the Sword is supreme!” Lin Yun’s sword sea began to rumble as a golden lotus bloomed behind him, releasing a radiance comparable to Eternal Dao.

The Flower Burial Sword, knocked away by Tian Xuanzi, returned, and Lin Yun swung it down after being empowered by the boundless sword intent.

Even if Tian Xuanzi tried his best to dodge, Lin Yun’s sword still left a cut on his cheek, leaving his beautiful face red in his blood.

Catching this opportunity, Lin Yun instantly saw through the gap of Tian Xuanzi altering between reality and imagination. But Tian Xuanzi smiled as the purple flower on his right shoulder bloomed with a divine rune shining brightly. When the flower bud began to ignite, a dazzling radiance shone that knocked Lin Yun back.

A bell rang between heaven and earth as various daos appeared. If any Saints remembered one of them, it would be a great fortune and opportunity to them.

Seeing this, all the spectating Saints exclaimed. This battle had far exceeded their expectations, and they could even feel their souls trembling.

“The Heavenly Dao Music!”

“Their battle even forced Heavenly Dao to reveal itself!”

“I can’t imagine this is a fight between two people beneath the Emperor Realm!”

“Flower Burial and Tian Xuanzi are strong. I’m afraid there won’t be anyone comparable to them even a thousand years later.” Various discussions resounded and all the Saints couldn’t help looking emotional.

The flower on Tian Xuanzi’s shoulder didn’t just resolve Lin Yun’s Heavenly Desolate Sword Intent, but the radiance released by Lin Yun’s sword intent began to dim under the flower’s strike. Just when Tian Xuanzi was going to completely hold the advantage in the fight, a dreamy flower bloomed on Lin Yun’s shoulder. That was the Othershore Flower!

Tian Xuanzi was momentarily lost in a dream, but no one knew what he dreamt. Taking this opportunity, Lin Yun grabbed onto the Flower Burial Sword and dashed forward.

Eight thousand years of reign with our halo enveloping ninety thousand miles. As long as the moon exists, the Sword Sect never dies!

When the Heavenly Desolate Sword Intent poured down, the sword vibration began to echo throughout the Sword Sect as though it had come to life. Ten-odd sword wounds instantly appeared on Tian Xuanzi’s body as he woke up from his dream, looking disappointed.

“It’s a good dream, and I’m willing to fall into this dream for ten thousand years!” Tian Xuanzi sighed and casually resolved Lin Yun’s attack. He muttered, “Have you forgotten your sword techniques? You’re only using Heavenly Dragon and Divine Phoenix. Where’s the Divine Firefly Sword?”

Tian Xuanzi previously resolved Lin Yun’s sword techniques. Even after being empowered with Heavenly Desolate Sword Intent, it still couldn’t do anything to Tian Xuanzi, who quickly resolved his attacks.

This made Lin Yun anxious, but he could do nothing about it.

“Let me teach you,” Tian Xuanzi smiled. “We should have a pure heart and be arrogant, prideful, and ruthless!”

As Tian Xuanzi spoke, the phenomenon created by the Great Profound Sword Canon and Profound Sky Canon combined into a lotus lamp.

Tian Xuanzi performed an exquisite sword technique, containing the overbearing and profundity of the Great Profound Sword Canon and the universal radiance of the Profound Sky Canon. When the lotus lamp began to ignite, flames were reflected in Tian Xuanzi’s eyes as multiple sword rays made heaven and earth flash between bright and dim like the lamp.

“Sun and moon? So what? The firefly is capable of extinguishing them!” Tian Xuanzi laughed. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

As a sword ray flew out from his fingertip, Lin Yun was sent flying away, and even the sword in his hand couldn’t stop Tian Xuanzi’s attack. With a wave of his hand, a jar of wine appeared in Tian Xuanzi’s hand as he gulped it down.

“Great wine! Hahaha!” Tian Xuanzi laughed, and his laughter radiated with a powerful aura.

All the spectating Saints in the Ancient Barren Domain threw a mouthful of blood under that laughter, covering their ears, and wore painful expressions.

Gulping down the wine, Tian Xuanzi raised the jar of wine, looking drunk, and he smiled, “Flower Burial, I’m not weaker than you, right?”

Lin Yun grabbed his sword with two hands to stop his hands from trembling, and he looked at Tian Xuanzi with a complicated gaze. Even if he hated Tian Xuanzi, he must admit that Tian Xuanzi was incredibly flawless. He said, “You’re a peerless talent, and few people can rival you even beyond the Kunlun Realm.”

Fusing the Profound Sky Canon and Great Profound Sword Canon was enough to prove Tian Xuanzi’s talent, even amazing Lin Yun.

“I can die with no regrets now,” Tian Xuanzi smiled.

“Why can’t you let the Sword Sect go? Why must you stop my master’s tribulation?” Lin Yun questioned, suppressing his anger. He was baffled because Tian Xuanzi could spare the Divine Phoenix Holy Master, but he kept targeting the Sword Sect, his master, and him.

Tian Xuanzi smiled, tossing the jar of wine aside. He smiled, “Kill me, then. Don’t hold back because I won’t hold back.”

Lin Yun said nothing while searching for an opportunity despite the difficulty.

“No one is truly perfect in the world. If there is someone perfect, then he’s not human. Flower Burial, think carefully because there will be a way.” Tian Xuanzi’s white robe fluttered in the wind as he charged towards Lin Yun again, the lotus lamp blooming behind him.

Lin Yun pondered what Tian Xuanzi had said and barely fended off the incoming attacks. The fight was more intense than before when they clashed, as the commotion reached ten thousand miles away, echoing throughout the Ancient Barren Domain.

A hundred moves later, the Firmament Saint Cloth became dim. Lin Yun suddenly thought of something and raised his head to look at Tian Xuanzi.

“It looks like you’ve guessed it,” Tian Xuanzi smiled.

Lin Yun said nothing, allowing Tian Xuanzi to charge at him. When Tian Xuanzi was about to reach him, Lin Yun willingly recalled the Firmament Saint Cloth. When the Firmament Saint Cloth disappeared, Lin Yun’s appearance was clear again, and everything within ten thousand miles was scared by this move.

Without the Firmament Saint Cloth, it would be impossible for Lin Yun to confront Tian Xuanzi.

On the other hand, Tian Xuanzi’s eyes radiated with murderous intent as he charged at Lin Yun. This made everyone exclaim because Tian Xuanzi wasn’t holding back, ignoring that Lin Yun recalled the Firmament Saint Cloth and unleashed his attacks.

But in the critical moment, a flower representing an Eternal Dao bloomed behind Lin Yun, and it was the Nirvana Dao. When the flower bloomed, Lin Yun stepped forth, breaking apart the barrier of space and time as he returned to a moment before, unleashing the Sword of the Beginning.

Light of the Beginning!

Boundless of the Beginning!

Glory of the Beginning!

Eternity of the Beginning!

Darkness of the Beginning!

Nirvana of the Beginning!

Lin Yun executed all of Sword of the Beginning in a split second before he was dragged back to the present.

Blood splashed out of Tian Xuanzi’s body, and this dazzled everyone. No one saw Lin Yun’s attacks, they only saw that just before Tian Xuanzi was about to get close to Lin Yun, blood began to splash out of him with his vitality seeping away.

This made Lin Yun rejoice, and his speculation that Tian Xuanzi wouldn’t hold back was correct. But the moment he wanted to unleash his full strength, he would have to reveal himself and couldn’t change to the imaginary.

This was why Lin Yun recalled the Firmament Saint Cloth, revealing a flaw, and placed his bet that Tian Xuanzi would take the bait. But that wasn’t all, as time and space stopped when Nirvana Dao bloomed again.

Forming seals with one hand, the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron traveled through the passage of time and space, shattering the membrane enveloping the Kunlun Realm. When the cauldron’s flames appeared above the Ancient Barren Domain, the nine domains of the Kunlun Realm shone with a golden brilliance once more.

Countless mountains and rivers were enveloped in a layer of radiance, accompanied by a dragon’s roar that spread out. When the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron smashed into Tian Xuanzi, the latter threw out a mouthful of blood, and his vitality was seeping away from him at a visible speed. This time, Tian Xuanzi was finished because no one could take this strike and still live to tell the tale, not even Tian Xuanzi.

But Tian Xuanzi’s palm didn’t stop, and Lin Yun was prepared to take the strike head-on. When the palm was about to land on him, Tian Xuanzi’s hand suddenly swiped Lin Yun’s cheeks with a gentle breeze. He smiled, “Flower Burial, I lied to you.”

Tian Xuanzi’s smile was carefree, leaving Lin Yun dumbfounded as he fell from the sky.

This made Lin Yun’s heart ache for some reason.

When Tian Xuanzi fell, he fell into Ye Guhan’s embrace while Ye Guhan held onto his hand. Bearing the tears from falling, Ye Guhan sobbed, “Tian Xuanzi, your hands are still as cold as before.”

“But Ye Guhan, I’m not afraid of the cold...” Tian Xuanzi smiled as he grabbed onto Ye Guhan’s hand. But before he could finish his sentence, he took his last breath in Ye Guhan’s embrace. With that, Tian Xuanzi’s life had ended, and there would be no more Tian Xuanzi in the world.

In the next moment, something strange occurred. Tian Xuanzi began to dissipate and turned into a painting in the air. The painting was Tian Xuanzi, wearing a gentle smile.

This left everyone dumbfounded before the painting rolled up and flew away. It was then grabbed by a hand that suddenly appeared in the air.

This made Lin Yun recover from his shock, and he could feel a chill down his spine because Tian Xuanzi was a painting right from the start.
