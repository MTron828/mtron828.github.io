Chapter 677 - Demonic Beast’s Territory

When the lizard demonic beast got back up on its feet, it looked at Lil’ Red with a torrential killing aura coming out from its body. Even its eyes had turned red. It was just about to obtain the Flamedragon Fruit, but it was sent flying away instead. It naturally lost its rationale from its rage.

Charging forward, the lizard demonic beast attacked Lil’ Red. But Lil’ Red’s eyes flashed with disdain and dodged the lizard demonic beast’s attack before launching its attack.

The colossal lizard demonic beast was sent flying away once more. But Lil’ Red didn’t stop there as its hooves crackled with crimson lightning before stomping down on the lizard demonic beast. The strong impact instantly broke the lizard demonic beast’s bones.

In the blink of an eye, the two demonic beasts had begun their battle, causing a mess in the surroundings. Lil’ Red was now comparable to a lesser Yin-Yang stage expert, not to mention that it had become even more powerful after awakening its dragon bloodline. So Lil’ Red firmly held its advantage.

Seven Slaughtering Fist–Omnipresent Anger!

Just when the outcome was about to be determined, Lin Yun made his move. He wouldn’t give the demonic beast a chance to escape. His surging killing aura began to overlap as the lightning runes on his body began to squirm. When his punch landed on the lizard demonic beast’s head, he smashed the demonic beast’s head instantly, killing it on the spot.

After dealing with the demonic beast, Lin Yun went to the Flamedragon Fruit and plucked it, along with the flower. When Lil’ Red saw this, its eyes lit up as it ran over wiggling its tail.

“This is yours.” Lin Yun handed Lil’ Red the flower, causing it to chuckle before it started chewing on the flower.

Very quickly, the flower was eaten and only the Flamedragon Fruit was left. Lin Yun quickly retracted his hand and smiled, “This is mine.”

This left Lil’ Red dumbfounded before it looked at the Flamedragon Fruit in Lin Yun’s hand pitifully. Then, it chewed on the leftover leaves.

Looking at Lil’ Red, Lin Yun couldn’t help smiling as he moved his hand. Lil’ Red’s head moved with Lin Yun’s hand since its eyes were glued to the Flamedragon Fruit. Suddenly, several people came over and saw the Flamedragon Fruit in Lin Yun’s hand with greed in their eyes.

“The Flamedragon Fruit!”

“We’re pretty lucky. It has been years since the Flamedragon Fruit last appeared. We actually found one!”

“Hehe, that’s right. We weren’t able to find it despite sealing off the mountain several times. But we found one merely strolling around.” The incoming people already considered the Flamedragon Fruit to be theirs, completely ignoring Lin Yun’s presence.

When they got close, Lin Yun saw a middle-aged man taking the lead. The middle-aged man’s cultivation was pretty decent as he was in the lesser Yin-Yang stage. Even those around him were in the pinnacle Yang stage. But Lin Yun soon figured out what was going on after seeing the emblem on their chests. They were disciples of the Ironblood Sword Gate.

The middle-aged man looked like he was in his thirties, was donned in black clothes, and was carrying a sword box. He had an extraordinary temperament. Lin Yun could sense that this middle-aged man was also a swordsman who had grasped the xiantian sword intent.

With a cultivation in the Yin-Yang stage and having grasped xiantian sword intent, this middle-aged man was probably an elder of the Ironblood Sword Gate.

“You should know the rules of my Ironblood Sword Gate. Since you’ve been discovered, hand over the Flamedragon Fruit if you don’t want to die.” A young disciple said coldly to Lin Yun.

On the contrary, the middle-aged man looked at the lizard demonic beast’s corpse before he smiled, “Young lad, you must’ve intruded this place mistakenly not knowing that the Ironblood Sword Gate has already sealed off the mountain.”

“I bet you must’ve subdued this Dragon Blooded Horse here at Flamedragon Hill as well. Since it’s a demonic beast that belonged to Flamedragon Hill, it naturally belongs to us. Leave the horse and the fruit behind if you want to live!” A young disciple looked at Lil’ Red with his eyes blazing.

The disciple’s words infuriated Lil’ Red as it unleashed a violent aura and glared at him. But Lin Yun patted its neck to calm it down. These people clearly considered Flamedragon Hill as their garden, so they wouldn’t even give others the opportunity to speak.

Not only did they want the Flamedragon Fruit, but they also wanted his horse. The middle-aged man wore an amicable smile and showed no intentions of stopping the disciples around him from speaking.

Lin Yun’s face gradually became cold and he said, “I was the one who found the Flamedragon Fruit, so it belongs to me. As for this Dragon Blooded Horse, it wasn’t subdued in Flamedragon Hill. Don’t push your luck.”

“So what if we’re pushing it?” That young disciple said coldly. “We’re already kind enough not to take your life. You shouldn’t push it.”

“This place belongs to my Ironblood Sword Gate. We’re already giving you face since we’re only taking the Flamedragon Fruit and the Dragon Blooded Horse,” said another disciple coldly.

The middle-aged man smiled, “Young lad, you’re not weak since you’re able to kill the lizard demonic beast. But you better mind that temper of yours in Flamedragon Hill or you’ll regret it.”

“Interesting…” Lin Yun sneered inwardly. These clowns think that I have a huge temper? They have no idea what would happen if I truly lose my temper!

“The Flamedragon Fruit is in my hand. Come and get it if you dare,” said Lin Yun.

The middle-aged man smiled as he slowly walked towards Lin Yun, “Then I’ll do as you say.”

In the blink of an eye, the middle-aged man had gotten close. Suddenly, his face sank as he reached for the Flamedragon Fruit while his other hand reached for Lin Yun’s wrist to subdue him.

“You’re too young to fight me!” The middle-aged man sneered as his eyes flashed with killing aura. But Lin Yun was faster than him as he put the Flamedragon Fruit away and threw a punch.

The middle-aged man’s face changed and he quickly retreated. When he was mid-air, he soared into the sky and retrieved his sword from his sword box. Then, he empowered his sword with his xiantian sword intent at lesser mastery. The middle-aged man smiled seeing that Lin Yun threw a punch at him. “You’re courting death!”

But the scene of blood splattering from Lin Yun’s arm didn’t occured. In fact, when his sword landed on Lin Yun’s fist, his sword ray crumbled and Lin Yun’s punch landed on his chest.

Sensing an immense force pouring into his body, the middle-aged man threw up a mouthful of blood before he was sent flying like a cannonball.

“Attack!” barked Lin Yun.

Right at this moment, Lil’ Red, whose anger was boiling, turned into a crimson bolt of lighting and charged forward. It instantly sent the four disciples flying.

Right at this moment, an orange flame soared into the sky before turning into a dazzling crimson flame. The huge commotion had instantly attracted everyone’s attention and they started to come over. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Let’s go!” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed as he knew that the Ironblood Sword Gate’s experts must’ve come. He called out to Lil’ Red and left.

When the middle-aged man got back on his feet, he had fear on his face. Not long after Lin Yun left, a white-haired elder, who emitted a powerful aura in the greater Yin-Yang stage, landed on the ground.

“Sect Master Tang!” The one who had arrived was the vice-sect master of the Ironblood Sword Gate, Tang Ying. His face was dark and he looked at the middle-aged man, “What’s going on?”

“A brat intruded into Flamedragon Hill. Not only did he injure me, but he even snatched the Flamedragon Fruit,” said the middle-aged man timidly.

“The Flamedragon Fruit?” Tang Ying’s eyes flashed as he turned his head to a certain direction. He could sense a terrifying aura quickly leaving. But it was a pity that the aura was too weak, which meant that the intruder was already out of his reach.

“Trash! You can’t even take care of a brat!” Tang Ying cursed and said, “Find that brat for me. If you mess up again, I’ll take your life!”

“Y-Y-Yes!” The middle-aged man said fearfully.

Lin Yun was still heading deep in Flamedragon Hill and he ran into some powerful demonic beasts along the way. But he had avoided them while traveling. After all, now wasn’t the time for him to fight with these demonic beasts.

He could also hear a commotion while traveling. He knew that it must be from the Ironblood Sword Gate who were searching for his location. Simultaneously, Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly as he had a first hand experience of how overbearing they were.

They might be a sect, but they weren’t any different from bandits. He was fortunate to have Lil’ Red around,which made it practically impossible for them to find him.

As Lin Yun headed deeper into Flamedragon Hill, he could sense a chill in the atmosphere, along with an ominous and violent aura that came in waves. Amid the violent aura, he could sense a powerful dragon pressure.

This made Lin Yun understand that the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture’s territory should be up ahead.

“How terrifying.” Lin Yun took a deep breath with a grave expression. He had never encountered an enemy as powerful as the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture in his life. But shortly after, Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with a decisive light and he entered the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture’s territory.
