Chapter 1414 - Who Else Dares To Fight?

Before everyone could respond, Lin Yun entered the two Saint Clans’ party with the black-clothed youth in his hand. He was fast and swung the black-clothed youth around, easily sending several people flying away.

He didn’t go easy on them and even circulated the Azure Dragon Saint Art while using the black-clothed youth as a weapon. Those hit by him were in great pain, and the black-clothed youth nearly lost it.

“You bastard! Let me go now!” The black-clothed youth was covered in wounds, and he could feel that his bones were on the verge of shattering whenever he collided with a person. If this continued, he would be toyed to death.

“Lin Yun, just you wait! Kill me if you have the guts!” The black-clothed youth was so furious that he threw out blood, but Lin Yun didn’t bother with him and continued to sweep through the two Saint Clans’ geniuses. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Whenever those geniuses saw Lin Yun, their faces turned pale, and they ran without hesitation. Lin Yun was invincible with the black-clothed youth in his hand, and no one dared to retaliate. The black-clothed youth was a genius of the Ancient Saint Clan, so who dared to touch him? Even Xiahou Yan was warned by Huang Yancheng when he wanted to retaliate, so they didn’t have the guts to retaliate.

Two Saint Clans and an Ancient Saint Clan geniuses had joined forces, but there was nothing they could do to Lin Yun. Huang Yancheng was strong but didn’t dare to get close to Lin Yun. If he got close, he could only suffer a one-sided beating. So Huang Yancheng’s face had long become dark, wanting to tear Lin Yun to pieces.

When the three remaining brothers of the Huang Clan stood together, their faces were ugly because they had never suffered such grievances since they appeared in public.

Xiahou Yan’s eyes flickered with Bai Zhanli and Xiahou Yun standing beside him. Lin Yun was simply a bastard because the thirty-odd people from the two Saint Clans could only receive a one-sided beating and didn’t dare to retaliate. This was a hilarious scene because even with so many of them there, none of them could do anything to Lin Yun.

“Don’t worry about my younger brother, and stop him!” Huang Yancheng finally made up his mind.

“That should’ve been the case right from the start.” Xiahou Yan coldly looked at Huang Yancheng.

“Let’s go!” Huang Yancheng let out a roar and charged Lin Yun with his brothers. They were strong, especially Huang Yancheng and Xiahou Yan, since they were all Heavenly Elysium Core Realm experts with their sword auras pressing down on Lin Yun. They were strong, especially Huang Yancheng and Xiahou Yan.

“Good!” Lin Yun stopped swinging the black-clothed youth around.

“Bastard, let me go now, or I’ll make you suffer something worse than death! Do you hear me?!” The black-clothed youth cursed.

But how could Lin Yun possibly release such a good weapon? He said, “It’s impossible to let you go. So let me show you a good time.”

When the black-clothed youth was wondering what Lin Yun was talking about, the entire world began to spin, and he no longer knew what was happening. When Lin Yun spun the black-clothed youth around, a wild storm appeared with Lin Yun using his thunderstorm intent on the black-clothed youth.

“Spinning Wheel!” Lin Yun roared, and the black-clothed youth could no longer see what was around him. Only his curses could be heard as he spun in mid-air.

“Lin Yun, you bastard! Let me go! I’m sorry! Please let me go!” As the thunderstorm raged, Lin Yun’s sword aura began to rise.

“S-Stop! Xiahou Yan, stop!” Huang Yancheng stopped his two brothers and roared at Xiahou Yan. If they continued to clash, he had no doubts that his fourth brother would surely die.

Xiahou Yan nearly lost it as he released his hand on this sword hilt and dodged Lin Yun’s attack. But the Huang Clan’s three brothers weren’t that fortunate. The black-clothed youth collided with Huang Yancheng’s chest. The sounds of his ribs breaking could be heard as the astral energy around Huang Yancheng instantly shattered.

This made Huang Yancheng throw out a mouthful of blood before he flew out. But Lin Yun didn’t stop there. He slammed the black-clothed youth in his hand against the two remaining Huang Clan’s brothers, sending them flying out as well.

Even when Zhao Yan saw this scene, the corner of his lips couldn’t help twitching. He knew Lin Yun had a ‘good’ temper, but he never expected that Lin Yun would be so ferocious when he became furious.

But Lin Yun didn’t stop there. He executed the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords with the black-clothed youth. A terrifying sword aura soon spread out as azure birds flew from his body.

Xiahou Yan’s face turned black when he saw this scene and quickly ducked. He avoided it in time, but Bai Zhanli and Xiahou Yun couldn’t.

“Lin Yun, you bastard!” Xiahou Yun cursed before the black-clothed youth collided against him. But Lin Yun didn’t let him go so easily and continued to smash the black-clothed youth against Xiahou Yun. It didn’t take long for Xiahou Yun to be thrashed, causing Bai Zhanli to quickly run away.

This scene made Xiahou Yan furious, and he drew his sword. Huang Yancheng quickly got up on his feet and yelled, “Lin Yun, let my younger brother go. I promise I won’t interfere with your enmity with the Xiahou Saint Clan. In the future, if I dare to do anything to the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, I’ll die a terrible death!”

“You should’ve said that from the beginning.” Lin Yun tossed the black-clothed youth away. The black-clothed youth was still alive, but even if Xiahou Yan didn’t draw his sword, he wouldn’t last long. There were no benefits to him if the black-clothed youth died. But it wasn’t bad if he could hold down the Huang Clan’s brothers.

Not to mention that even if he lost the black-clothed youth, didn’t he have another one on the ground right now? Lin Yun lowered his head to look at Xiahou Yun after tossing the black-clothed youth away.

This made Xiahou Yun feel a chill because he knew what Lin Yun wanted to do. He cried out, “Big Brother, save me!”

“You’re courting death!” Xiahou Yan couldn’t be bothered and unleashed a dazzling golden sword ray. As a powerful sword intent exploded, Xiahou Yan utilized his firmament sword intent right then. Furthermore, his skin also became like jade due to his Innate Sword Physique, and his heart also began to beat violently like a furnace due to his Innate Sword Heart.

Whenever his heart throbbed, a rumbling sword vibration would echo, surprising Lin Yun. But it would be too cheap for Xiahou Yan if he let this matter go so easily.

Thus, Lin Yun didn’t hesitate to unleash his firmament sword intent and slammed his palm against Xiahou Yun’s chest before Xiahou Yan’s attack reached him. His palm pushed Xiahou Yun towards Xiahou Yan’s direction, making Xiahou Yan’s face change as he sheathed his sword and caught Xiahou Yun.

But Lin Yun didn’t go easy with that palm, so Xiahou Yan was forced to take three steps back before he managed to stabilize himself.

Lin Yun merely tapped his foot to firmly land on the ground and didn’t suffer any injuries. On the other hand, all of the geniuses from the two Saint Clans were practically heavily injured. They were all lying on the ground, groaning in pain. As for the Huang Clan’s brothers, Huang Yancheng’s face was ugly when he caught the black-clothed youth.

This was because almost all of his fourth brother’s bones were nearly broken, and his consciousness was a mess. The black-clothed youth couldn’t speak a complete sentence and had white foam exiting his mouth.

“Lin Yun, you’re ruthless!” Xiahou Yan nearly lost it when he examined Xiahou Yun’s injuries. This was too ruthless, and he had never suffered such a huge loss.

“Well, I have a good temper compared to you,” said Lin Yun. If he was allowed to kill in the secret realm, he would've slaughtered everyone here. His killing intent was about to lose control when he saw Ye Ziling cry. But when everyone heard Lin Yun’s words, the surrounding atmosphere suddenly became tense.

“Tsk, tsk. How bustling. I nearly missed a good show while rushing to the sword mound.” A peal of laughter resounded as Ye Ziyun, Ye Qing, and the other Ye Clan’s geniuses appeared.

This changed Huang Yancheng and Xiahou Yan’s faces because they had no idea when Ye Ziyun arrived. They didn’t detect her presence at all!

Ye Ziyun was a flawless beauty. She looked at Xiahou Yan and smiled, “Innate Sword Physique and Innate Sword Heart are extraordinary, and I’m fortunate to witness it today.”

“You want to interfere?” Xiahou Yan indifferently asked. He noticed that the whole Ye Clan party was standing beside the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s party, gathered around Lin Yun.

“You don’t have to care about that because you won’t be able to touch anyone from the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect today!” Ye Ziyun smiled with a light flashing through her pupils. She wasn’t afraid of Xiahou Yan at all.

Meanwhile, Lin Yun took two steps back and examined Ye Ziyun before he fell into deep thoughts.
