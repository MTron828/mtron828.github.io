Chapter 2044 - Sword Mound

After the white-clothed man left, Lin Yun’s gaze fell onto the dao flame left behind by the Emperor Sword. It was so dazzling that Lin Yun didn’t dare to look at it directly.

Lin Yun wondered who the Emperor in the Kunlun Realm was since there was the Emperor Sword. He carefully approached the dao flame, which looked like a bright sun. The dao flame shone brightly, painting Lin Yun in a layer of golden radiance.

As he stood before the dao flame, he was breath-taken by the powerful sword aura it gave off, and he couldn’t see the top when he raised his head. It felt as though there was a thousand-foot-tall volcano in front of him.

He felt insignificant before it, and it was like what the senior said, this was Astral Sword Intent at the extreme. This should be the strongest the Astral Sword Intent could reach, and it wasn’t needed to reach such a height before making a breakthrough. In reality, one only needed to reach one-third of it to try and make a breakthrough in sword intent. The extreme wasn’t something that just anyone could achieve.

“Has Senior Brother’s sword intent reached the extreme?” Lin Yun thought about Jian Jingtian. He caught a glimpse back then, and Jian Jingtian’s sword intent was like a bright sun. It was similar to what he saw now because his senior brother had accumulated it for eighteen years, and he wondered if his senior brother had made a breakthrough.

Taking a deep breath, Lin Yun concentrated his sword intent on his right hand and reached towards the dao flame. But Lin Yun only lasted for a brief moment before he was sent flying.

I’m too insignificant before it; even Senior Brother isn’t this strong. Lin Yun inwardly pondered. It should be because of the Emperor Sword. So Lin Yun had to be more cautious.

Lin Yun spread his arms apart and retreated to the galaxy before calming himself down to observe and comprehend, trying to refine the three strands of flames within his body. His cultivation wasn’t high, and he couldn’t be compared to a Quasi-Saint. But in terms of comprehension in sword dao, he wasn’t afraid.

He moved along the water as he refined the three strands of flames. The flames soon ignited, forming an invisible aura with dao flame. They looked like two gears turning or two fishes chasing after each other’s tails, looking profound. As time passed, Lin Yun soon sank into it, and reality became disorienting.

“What’s going on?” Lin Yun opened his eyes to discover that he went along with the galaxy flow and came to the back of the dao flame. But that wasn’t the most terrifying thing. Time was completely in a mess in just a moment. The three strands of flames within his violet palace were still shining brightly, but there were no signs of them being refined.

“Can it be that the three strands of flames can’t be refined?” Lin Yun wasn’t willing to give up. He had no resources now, and his Astral Sword Intent could only rely on the three strands of flames if he wanted to take a step forth.

Lin Yun took a deep breath to calm himself down. He no longer thought about resources nor the Sword Assembly. His focus was entirely on the three strands of flames, tossing everything else to the back of his mind.

Lin Yun’s heart gradually became clear, like a piece of jade without any impurities. He didn’t know how long he lasted in this state but found himself in a dark sky when he reopened his eyes. He stepped on this tattered land while looking at the starry sky and the universe in the surroundings.

“This is…?” Lin Yun looked around and found himself on an ancient sword mound.

This place was filled with murderous intent that could make anyone tremble in fear. The ground was covered with skeletons with rusted swords piercing those skeletons. As a cold breeze blew, ghostly howls echoed, the sky becoming dark. A huge ghost dashed over, wanting to devour him.

This instantly made Lin Yun panic as he circulated his movement technique, wanting to leave this place. But this place was weird. He was clearly traveling at a fast speed, but he was barely moving.

Just when the skull condensed with a demonic aura that wanted to devour him, a buzzing sound came from the sword mound and a rusted sword shone brightly, devouring the skull.

Lin Yun took this opportunity to draw the Flower Burial Sword and clashed with the ghostly wind.

Simultaneously, three flames flew out of Lin Yun’s body and shone with the dao flame. A figure appeared from the three strands of flames, practicing the second section of the Divine Firefly Sword.

Whenever that figure swung their sword, golden radiance entered his body and was devoured by the sun and moon sword stars. When that figure swung his sword even faster, it manifested tens of millions of lights that were devoured even faster.

“Mhm?” The white-clothed man sensed the changes in the dao flame and appeared outside the galaxy. His gaze was fixed on Lin Yun, and he said, “He succeeded! No one has ever succeeded in refining it in the past because the ancestors didn’t leave behind the flames!”

A few minutes later, the three flames intertwined and formed a vortex, entering Lin Yun’s forehead. The aura Lin Yun gave off began to rise, and he breathed a sigh of relief when the vortex entered his forehead.

When Lin Yun looked around, the scenery before him looked familiar, yet strange simultaneously. Lin Yun was bewildered as he asked, “Where am I?”

Lin Yun could hear the galaxy flowing in his ears. When Lin Yun came to his senses, he realized that this was the Celestial Purging Mountain within the Heavenly Dao Sect.

“It feels like I’ve practiced my sword for ten years on the sword mound…” Lin Yun fought on the sword mound, accompanied by the sword that saved him as he practiced his sword technique. Practicing day and night allowed him to form a strong relationship with that sword, even stronger than his relationship with the Flower Burial Sword.

When he grabbed that sword and wanted to pull it out, he returned to reality. This was the reason why he was bewildered. He could feel that the sword was afraid of something, driving him out.

“Mhm?” Lin Yun was surprised to discover that the three flames have disappeared and entered his forehead. With his sword sea, the sun and moon were hanging high in the sky with eighteen galaxies, each reaching a thousand feet beneath the sun and moon.

“I’ve succeeded?” Lin Yun was pleasantly surprised. Not only did he manage to refine the flames, but he also manifested eighteen galaxies. Wanting to give it another try, the sun and moon fused with a single thought. With a loud explosion, thirty-six galaxies appeared around Lin Yun.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

As the galaxies flowed, Lin Yun suddenly thought of something as he looked at them. Lin Yun raised his head at the galaxies around the dao flame and saw that they were slowly revolving. But as the stars changed, time and space became disordered, with various phenomena appearing.

“Interesting… I get it now.” Lin Yun suddenly understood the words left behind by Yu Qingfeng. Not competing for first but supremacy throughout time.

“This is probably the true meaning of the Divine Firefly Sword’s second section.” Lin Yun felt enlightened as the scenes before him became clear, and the Divine Firefly Sword began to appear before him.

This brought joy to Lin Yun’s face as he flicked his finger with sword rays flying out.

Lin Yun unleashed the thirteen swords of Divine Firefly Sword’s second section as though he could execute them in the first place. Lin Yun was stunned in amazement as he said, “I have reached greater mastery in this sword technique. This is unbelievable.”

Lin Yun looked at the dao flame and felt a sense of familiarity coming from it. He sat with his legs crossed and reached out, which the dao flame retreated upon sensing him.

“What’s going on?” Lin Yun was disappointed that he was chased out of the Emperor Sword’s dao flame.

“Ye Qingtian, have you seen that sword?” The white-clothed man came over in a hurry.

“I saw it,” Lin Yun replied.

“Where is it? Tell me about it!” The white-clothed man looked agitated.

“It’s in an astral sword mound. That place is filled with corpses and ghost winds. I nearly died there. The sword appeared at last, and it stayed within a radius of a hundred meters.”

“What happened then?” The white-clothed man asked.

“I was trapped there, cutting the ghost wind and ghosts.”

“You didn’t draw it out?” The white-clothed man’s eyes nearly bulged out.

“I did, but I was chased out after that,” Lin Yun said.

“How did that happen? It should have recognized you with the three strands of flames,” the white-clothed man muttered.

Lin Yun pondered and said, “I can feel that it’s afraid of me. It was afraid when I held onto it and wanted to break free from me. As a result, I was chased out.”

The white-clothed man was stunned and said, “How is that possible? How can the Emperor Sword possibly fear you?”

Lin Yun wasn’t entirely certain about it, then said, “Perhaps it’s my misperception.”

Lin Yun turned to look at the dao flame, but felt that it wasn’t a misperception.

“This is really unbelievable.” The white-clothed man’s face changed, and he sighed, “It was such a good opportunity, and I have no idea when the next time someone will come who can bring the Emperor Sword back.”

The white-clothed man was too obsessed with the Emperor Sword.

“Senior…” Lin Yun didn’t know what to say.

The white-clothed man smiled, “It’s fine. You don’t have to blame yourself for it. At the very least, we now know where it’s located.”

“What’s the connection between the flames I’ve received and the Emperor Sword?” Lin Yun asked.

“You should ask what’s the connection between the flames’ owner with the Emperor Sword,” the white-clothed man smiled.
