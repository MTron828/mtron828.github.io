Chapter 2203: Ancient Profound Heaven, Myriad Swords Unite

Lin Yun saw seven wheels, each with different colors, matching the seven Glory Spirits. After one mastered the nineteenth stage of the Profound Sky Canon, one could form the Profound Sky Universe within their bodies. He understood this cultivation technique well because his third senior brother, Mu Chuan, had explained it to him, and he instantly recognized the cultivation technique that his senior brother was using, the Profound Sky Canon!

The complete Profound Sky Canon was a Dragon Spirit Martial Technique that Tian Xuanzi had completed. But after forming the Profound Sky Universe, it would be comparable to a divine cultivation technique.

Lin Yun was shocked as to why Ye Guhan would know about the Profound Sky Canon, not to mention that he had reached a high level with it.

“Isn’t that the Profound Sky Canon?” Bai Shuying asked.

Lin Yun’s eyes flickered because he was also baffled. This wasn’t a weak version of the Profound Sky Canon. His senior brother’s attainment in it wasn’t at all inferior to Tian Xuanzi’s.

As Lin Yun had expected, Ye Guhan executed the Great Profound Heaven, and the powerful aura he gave off was something he had only seen from Tian Xuanzi. Ye Guhan hovered in the air with seven wheels coiling around him, and a pagoda manifested from the Great Profound Heaven, hovering in the sky, releasing a light beam.

“The Profound Sky Canon? Interesting…” The red-clothed youth was surprised, but he soon showed interest on his face.

“There’s something even more interesting.” Ye Guhan smiled as he pushed the sword forth. When the sword pierced into space, the sword aura released from Ye Guhan formed into an illusory figure chasing after the Azure River Sword Saint.

The red-clothed youth had already blocked the attack unleashed by the Azure River Sword Saint, but when he saw the blurred figure grabbing onto the Azure River Sword and released a powerful aura, the red-clothed youth was sent flying away.

“You’re only a clone, so let me see how capable you are!” Ye Guhan circulated the Profound Sky Canon as he charged at the red-clothed youth.

Everyone was surprised by this scene because the Azure River Sword was flying around, attacking the red-clothed youth without an ‘actual’ person controlling it, executing the Great Profound Sword Canon. At this moment, it was as though Ye Guhan had divided himself into two, his main body executing the Profound Sky Canon while the Azure River Sword performed the Great Profound Sword Canon.

This wasn’t just a clone because the Profound Sky Canon and Great Profound Sword Canon had perfectly fused together, exhibiting a terrifying power. In just a brief moment, multiple wounds appeared on the red-clothed youth, and he was completely suppressed by Ye Guhan.

This immediately left everyone dumbfounded with their mouths wide open.

“How is this possible?”

“That’s the Profound Sky Canon and Great Profound Sword Canon?”

“How did the Azure River Sword Saint manage to do it? The sword seems to be under someone’s control, but we can’t see it with our naked eyes.”

“This is too bizarre.” The Zhang and Bai Clan’s Saints were shocked. After they knew of the red-clothed youth’s identity, they already felt despair, but they now saw a glimmer of hope in Ye Guhan.

The fight between the two was terrifying. They even destroyed the natural laws of heaven and earth as cracks swiftly spread on the ground. There was even a hint of chaos, accompanied by many scenes that confuses one from the past and present. This naturally shocked everyone because this was the means of an Emperor.

The red-clothed youth might be a clone, but he was an Emperor that was not inferior to the Nine Emperors. There were rumors that the Blood Moon Sect fought with the Empress, and he was nearly killed. But not only did he survive, he even inflicted heavy injuries on the Empress. After that battle, the Empress never showed herself in public anymore.

“Moon Picking Hand!” A roar echoed from the clash between the red-clothed youth and Ye Guihan as a crimson moon was lifted with one palm. As the crimson moon revolved, space began to shatter that almost swept through everything, and the sword aura supplying to the Great Profound Sword Canon was severed.

Seeing this move again, everyone’s expressions changed as the red-clothed youth had previously used this to defeat Ye Guhan along with the seven peaks. Aside from that, it was slightly different this time because the gap between the red-clothed youth and Ye Guhan began to increase. They were infinitely close, but they were separated by a large distance.

As the crimson moon rose to the sky, the red-clothed youth held onto the crimson moon. He might be covered with wounds, but he was still arrogant, and this was his pride as an Emperor. The red-clothed youth coldly said, “Even if I’m a clone, an Emperor will not be humiliated! Radiant Sword Saint’s chief disciple, you can die now!”

But a smile rose on Ye Guhan’s lips as he soared to the sky, shattering space like mirrors with a hundred Ye Guhans reflected. His hair fluttered in the wind, and he was fearless when facing the red-clothed youth who was like a myth.

As the figures overlapped, Ye Guhan dodged multiple terrifying spatial cracks as he grabbed the Azure River Sword with his hand. In that split second, the Great Profound Sword Canon and Profound Sky Canon magically fused together.

With his hair fluttering in the wind, a terrifying golden saint aura gushed out from Ye Guhan that pushed his physique to the limit, and he might explode at any moment. But Ye Guhan laughed even when he could die the next moment, looking like a madman. Under the crimson moonlight, he laughed with arrogance as he swung his sword, “Ancient Profound Heaven—Myriad Swords Unite!”

This sword ray that he unleashed couldn’t be described with words because the shattered space that looked like a jigsaw puzzle began to come together. Relying on space dao, the distance between Ye Guhan and the red-clothed youth closed up as the sword approached.

This time, the red-clothed youth finally showed a hint of fear and disbelief in his eyes. This was because Ye Guhan had grasped Space Dao, one of the Eternal Daos. But the red-clothed youth didn’t have the luxury of time as the sword ray flew over, splitting the crimson moon into two.

Then, tens of thousands of crimson fireworks exploded in the sky. When the sword ray landed on the red-clothed youth, the latter threw out a mouthful of blood with his emperor aura shattered as he fell onto one knee. Whenever he threw out a mouthful of blood, the aura he gave off would decline, and he soon dropped to the Saint Realm.

“Old fart, since my master can defeat you, I can naturally defeat you as well. You are nobody to humiliate the Radiant’s lineage!” Ye Guhan laughed heartily. But when he landed on the ground, he threw out a mouthful of blood with his face becoming pale.

This scene made Lin Yun feel a heartache, and he charged over, arriving beside Ye Guhan. He couldn’t be bothered about anything else as he injected the blue dragon aura into Ye Guhan’s back.

But Ye Guhan was still throwing out blood with a bright smile on his face. He casually pushed Lin Yun away. Seeing the anxiety in Lin Yun’s eyes, he smiled, “Silly boy, the injuries caused by Eternal Dao aren't that easy to heal. But I won’t be dying anytime soon.”

“Don’t lie to me!” Lin Yun yelled with tears welling in his eyes. He came so far from the Heavenly Path, and he had always been alone, gritting his teeth as he persevered. But after being accepted by the Radiant Sword Saint, he found a home, and he had treated his senior brothers as his family.

This was why Lin Yun couldn’t help thinking of Big Brother Xin Jue when he saw Ye Guhan’s condition, and he was really afraid at this moment.

“I really won’t die, and I’m fine aside from the fact that I can’t eat any fruits,” Ye Guhan smiled bitterly. His injuries might be serious, but he won’t die.

“It’s not that easy to kill a Great Saint,” Bai Shuying comforted.

Ye Guhan smiled, “See, even the holy maiden knows more than you, and you still call yourself a Holy Maiden Killer? You don’t look like a scumbag with how you are crying now.”

Seeing that Ye Guhan was still so harsh with his mouth, Lin Yun breathed a sigh of relief.

“Azure River Sword Saint, let me end that old goat’s life!” A Zhang Clan’s Saint dashed over, seeing that the red-clothed youth’s aura was only at the Quasi-Saint Realm.

“Don’t!” Just when Ye Guhan wanted to chew on a fruit, his face changed.

But it was already too late as the red-clothed youth soared to the sky and grabbed that Saint by the neck. He coldly said, “Who do you think you are to interfere? Are you also a disciple of the Radiant Sword Saint?” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

His tone was filled with rage and a hint of murderous intent. The Zhang Clan’s Saint struggled, but there was nothing he could do as he sensed his life force being sucked away.

“The Undying Phoenix Scripture…” Ye Guhan sighed. He then said with a grave expression, “Let’s retreat. We can’t stay here any longer.”

Everyone’s faces changed, and they asked, “Where are we going?”

“The altar.” Ye Guhan struggled on his feet, and Lin Yun quickly went over to support him.

The Undying Phoenix Scripture was domineering and it could extract life force from others to replenish his own, and it could even devour the target’s cultivation.

The Zhang Clan’s Saint was too careless and ended up becoming a first-aid pack for the red-clothed youth. If he had been more cautious, he wouldn’t have fallen into this situation.

After devouring the Zhang Clan’s Saint, the red-clothed youth recovered from fifty-percent of his injuries, and it would be a lot more troublesome for Ye Guhan to recover his injuries. As a result, they could only retreat to the altar to open the array and see if their predecessors could protect them. This was the last retreating location that the Thousand Plume Great Saint planned.

The group swiftly left the Nether Orchid Courtyard and headed to the altar. The red-clothed youth’s injuries were serious, but he could only coldly watch them leave as he executed the Undying Phoenix Scripture.

“You guys go as well. There are only two safe places left in the Heavenly Dao Sect, and the altar is one of them. Come with me,” Ye Guhan said as he looked at Lin Yun and Bai Shuying.

“Okay.” Lin Yun nodded and left with Bai Shuying.

Along the way, Bai Shuying couldn’t help her curiosity, so she asked, “Ye Qingtian, if you’re here for the divine rune, I have a secret that I haven’t told you…”

“What secret?” Lil’ Purple suddenly appeared with a smile as she asked.

At the bottom of the Celestial Pool, the Holy Spirit Son managed to resolve the seal and separated the divine rune from the restriction. But when everyone took a look at the divine rune, their faces changed to disbelief. This was the Sovereign Divine Rune, but it wasn’t the Solar Lunar Divine Rune. There was only the Lunar Divine Rune and not the Solar Divine Rune. The Sovereign Divine Rune had been split into two!
