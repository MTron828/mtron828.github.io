Chapter 480 - Danger!

The five demonic beasts looked at Lil’ Red with disdain. In their eyes, a demonic beast that wasn’t in the Violet Palace Realm must be courting death to fight with them. The first demonic beast, a Rock Horned Beast, was heavily struck down before it could even react. Lil’ Red was releasing a terrifying aura and crimson flames blazed from its body like a volcano.

The Rock Horned Beast unleashed a ferocious roar as it suffered a wound from Lil’ Red’s horn. But the four other demonic beasts still charged to the top of the mountain. After all, there was a feast waiting for them at the top of the mountain. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

The mountain began to tremble and it didn’t take long before Lil’ Red gradually fell into a disadvantage. It was soon covered in injuries. After all, it was fighting against five Violet Palace Realm demonic beasts on its own.

Lin Yun sighed as he roughly guessed why Lil’ Red wanted to protect the Violet Flame Demonwolf. It must’ve been infected by the Violet Flame Demonwolf’s willpower. Without a doubt, Lin Yun had also been touched by the will of the Violet Flame Demonwolf.

If he was Lil’ Red, he wondered if he would charge right up without any hesitation. He had been with Lil’ Red for a long time, so he knew its intelligence wasn’t any weaker than humans.

“Dumbass…” Lin Yun's eyes flashed coldly. No matter how dumb Lil’ Red was, it was still his companion, so he would not sit by the side and watch it get bullied.

Lin Yun spread his arms apart and soared into the sky like a golden crow. Just when a Demonic Ironbull was about to charge at Lil’ Red, Lin Yun threw a punch out, “Get lost!”

The Demonic Ironbull was knocked away, but at the same time, Lin Yun felt his fist becoming numb as he had to take several steps backwards. The Demonic Ironbull’s defense had shocked him. Clearly, these five demonic beasts must be stronger than the demonic beasts he usually encountered. They must be the elites in their cultivation level.

When Lil’ Red saw Lin Yun get up and chase one demonic beast away, Lil’ Red turned to look at Lin Yun and grinned.

“You’re actually in the mood to smile,” sighed Lin Yun bitterly. Terrifying aura began to explode from the peak of the mountain. But this aura was still nothing compared to the tribulation.

Lin Yun swung out his fists like a sword and it didn’t take long for him to kill the Demonic Ironbull. However, he still took a hit to the chest. He wiped the blood off from the corner of his lips as he looked at the four remaining demonic beasts and locked his brows together. The other demonic beasts clearly had no intention of giving up.

They might have a chance if they fought the demonic beasts individually, but at this rate, they would only be exhausted to death if they stayed. Lin Yun spoke out, “Lil’ Red, time to get going.”

But Lil’ Red actually refused to leave. It had completely disregarded its life and death. Right at this moment, the Violet Flame Demonwolf’s ‘corpse’ started to release a terrifying aura. It actually started to heal at a rapid speed as brimming vitality was being released.

Shortly after, the Violet Flame Demonwolf actually stood up and released an aura in the Heavenly Soul Realm. In the next second, a bolt of lightning flashed and the Rock Horned Beast was torn into two. Then, it turned its head to another demonic beast and breathed out, incinerating that demonic beast into ashes.

“This…” Lin Yun was dumbfounded. The Violet Flame Demonwolf was actually releasing a Heavenly Soul Realm aura. Did the Violet Flame Demonwolf actually succeed in its tribulation?

This scene startled the two other demonic beasts as they began to run. Lin Yun looked at this scene and he smacked his lips together. He was shocked by the Violet Flame Demonwolf’s power.

The Violet Flame Demonwolf returned to the top of the mountain and nodded its head at Lil’ Red. Then, it turned to look at Lin Yun. This instantly made Lin Yun feel a looming fear. However, Lil’ Red stood in front of Lin Yun to cover him.

“Human, you were hiding because you were after me, right?” The Violet Flame Demonwolf actually spoke in the human language, which startled Lin Yun. It continued, “Is it weird? It’s not impossible for ordinary demonic beasts to speak the human language, not to mention that I’ve touched the Heavenly Soul Realm. But you don’t have to worry because I won’t kill you.”

“You failed your tribulation?” asked Lin Yun.

“Yes, I failed.” The Violet Flame Demonwolf looked at Lin Yun coldly and the flame on its forehead began to dim. Clearly, it only released an outburst like a dying star. It wouldn't be long before the Violet Flame Demonwolf died.

“You’re here for this, right?” The Violet Flame Demonwolf spat out a crimson beast core that emitted a terrifying aura. The beast core contained the Violet Flame Demonwolf’s essence and there were demonic runes engraved on the core.

“This…” The beast core landed in Lin Yun’s hand before he could even react.

“Leave quickly. You’re not the only one attracted by my tribulation,” said the Violet Flame Demonwolf.

“Leave?” An aged voice sounded out as a black-clothed old man appeared out of nowhere.

The Violet Flame Demonwolf’s eyes flashed coldly and he bolted forward. It clearly wanted to kill the black-clothed old man before its death. But it no longer possessed the Heavenly Soul Realm’s strength, so it was easily killed by the old man.

“No!” Lin Yun’s face changed drastically. Lil’ Red was also looking at the black-clothed old man furiously, but it didn’t dare to do anything because of the old man’s terrifying aura.

“I originally thought that it had failed its tribulation and that there was nothing good left behind. It’s good that I came back,” smiled the old man as he looked at Lin Yun. “Young lad, hand the beast core over. It’s not something that you should have.”

His tone was strong and he left no room for rejection.

Lin Yun’s face was grave, but he couldn’t accept the sudden changes. First, the Violet Flame Demonwolf came back to life and gave its beast core to him. However, all of a sudden, another person came.

Lin Yun began to think of a solution. This old man must be in the greater Yin stage of the Violet Palace Realm. There was no way he could compete with the old man. The Violet Palace Realm was separated into three stages - Yin, Yang, and Yin-Yang. Each stage was further separated into the initial, lesser, greater, and complete phase.

He might have a chance against the lesser Yin stage of the Violet Palace Realm, but not against the greater phase. Furthermore, if this black-clothed old man cultivated an earth grade cultivation technique, Lin Yun’s odds of winning were even worse.

“What’s the matter? You’re not willing to hand it over?” The black-clothed old man was rather surprised.

“I dare now,” whispered Lin Yun. “I’ll hand it over immediately.”

“Give it. Even if a Heavenly Soul Realm’s beast core is valuable, it’s not as valuable as your life,” said the old man as he stroked his beard.

Lin Yun approached the old man. The old man’s gaze fell onto the beast core as his eyes blazed with heat. “Interesting, this demonic beast actually possessed an ancient bloodline. No wonder it's tribulation was so terrifying. But now, it’s mine!”

The old man grabbed the beast core, but he actually missed. He then raised his head and looked at Lin Yun coldly.

“Sorry, but I don’t have a habit of giving what’s mine.” Lin Yun instantly formed the four seals over and unleashed the four combined seals. This attack made the old man throw up a mouthful of blood and his face turned pale. He looked at Lin Yun in disbelief because he clearly never expected that someone in the quasi-Violet Palace Realm would actually attack him.

“You’re courting death!” The black-clothed old man threw a palm at Lin Yun’s chest, but he unleashed that attack too quickly, so he couldn’t build up any power.

“Let’s go!” Lin Yun jumped on Lil’ Red and pushed it to run as fast as possible. In the blink of an eye, they were already a few thousand meters away.

“You think you can run?” The black-clothed old man wiped the blood off his lips and a grim look filled his eyes.
