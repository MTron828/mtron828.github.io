Chapter 914 - Undercurrent

Everyone was dumbfounded as Feng Wuji’s decapitated corpse hit the ground. They couldn’t believe that Feng Wuji was killed just like that.

A moment ago, Feng Wuji was challenging Lin Yun. But as soon as he finished speaking, his head was already in the air. The majority of the people present couldn’t even see Feng Wuji draw his blade, not to mention how Lin Yun killed him.

By the time they reacted, they only saw a lotus behind Lin Yun as he sheathed his sword. No one could see Lin Yun’s movements.

“Is he dead?”

“How did Feng Wuji die?”

“He only needed one sword. Just what kind of monster is Lin Yun?! Feng Wuji is basically in the Azure Dragon Ranking! This doesn’t make any sense!” An uproar broke out after a long silence later because Feng Wuji’s death sent waves through everyone’s heart.

Compared to those from Glorysun Land, the geniuses from the higher realms were dripping in cold sweat. The others might not have seen Lin Yun’s attack, but they saw it clearly. Lin Yun’s sword was so fast that Feng Wuji couldn’t react in time. If Feng Wuji was able to draw his blade, he might have been able to stop Lin Yun’s attack.

Chen Qiong and Xian Yunzhen were feeling the most fear. After all, they remembered that Lin Yun told them not to force him to use his sword.

They even rejoiced inwardly that they didn’t force Lin Yun to draw his sword because Lin Yun had the strength to back up his words. If Feng Wuji was killed by Lin Yun, they stood no chance against Lin Yun. As for Mo Han, Shi Feng, and Chen An, their faces were grave.

ALthough the higher realm geniuses saw Lin Yun’s attack, they didn’t see the majestic phenomenon that lasted for a split second. The others only saw a lotus behind Lin Yun. Feng Wuji didn’t lose because he was slow, but because of the huge gap between their attainments in the martial path. The phenomenon empowered Lin Yun’s sword intent and allowed him to seal Feng Wuji.

By the time Feng Wuji used his blade to break the restriction, it was too late. The strength that Lin Yun displayed was comparable to the second soul Heavenly Soul Realm geniuses on the Azure Dragon Ranking. However, Lin Yun was nowhere near them in cultivation and achieved everything solely with the sword in his hand.

Lin Yun’s attack was so profound that it was hard for the geniuses to digest everything that had happened. However, Lin Yun didn’t feel the same. He could sense that his attack wasn’t perfect and that there was still room for improvement. If he cultivated it to a high enough level, no one would be able to see him sheath his sword.

Lin Yun didn’t put his sword away slowly, so speed wasn’t the problem. The issue was that he had exhausted a great deal of mental energy and origin energy with his attack. However, since Feng Wuji was dead, he didn’t need to worry about how slow he sheathed his sword. Overall, his sword speed was extremely fast, but that wasn’t even the most impressive thing. The majestic scene of the blooming lotus had terrifying power. Even if Feng Wuji was as fast as Lin Yun, he wouldn’t have been able to take the attack head-on.

Suddenly, the blade in Feng Wuji’s hand flew over to Lin Yun. Many people were feeling envious when they saw this. After all, the blade was an extremely valuable dao artifact. In the end, Lin Yun took the blade and Feng Wuji’s interspatial pouch.

There was no doubt that the pouch of a higher realm genius was full of unimaginable treasure. Mo Han, Shi Feng, and Chen An also took a step forward to speak with Lin Yun.

“Friend, you have a really big appetite. Not only did you take the Nethercloud Blade, but you even took Feng Wuji’s interspatial pouch. Aren’t you taking it a little too far?” Mo Han squinted while he smiled.

Feng Wuji’s death surprised them, but since Feng Wuji was dead, there was no need for them to think more about it. It was more important for them to benefit after Feng Wuji’s death, especially when the Bloodbone Realm would come after Lin Yun and not them.

“You really are terrifying since you killed Feng Wuji with one sword. But, you probably can’t do that against all of us, right?” Shi Feng was trying to force Lin Yun to give up Feng Wuji’s interspatial pouch.

“You guys can give it a try,” smiled Lin Yun as he put Feng Wuji’s interspatial pouch away.

“You!” Mo Han, Shi Feng, and Chen An became enraged when they saw that Lin Yun had no intention of taking a step back. They were confident that Lin Yun could only use his attack once more, but none of them were willing to test their theory. After all, none of them were confident that they could take the sword head-on.

If they wanted to kill Lin Yun without any risk, they either had to become stronger or kill Lin Yun before he drew his sword. Mo Han spoke coldly, “Don’t act so smug just because you killed Feng Wuji. The Bloodbone Realm is a top-tier realm among the higher realms. They have many experts on the Azure Dragon Ranking. They even have third soul Heavenly Soul Realm geniuses. It’s practically impossible for you to leave the Azure Dragon Region now that you’ve killed Feng Wuji.”

“Cut the crap and get lost. You don’t need to be concerned with that,” said Lin Yun.

“I guess we’ll wait and see!” Mo Han glared at Lin Yun before heading towards the barrier. His eyes were flashing with reluctance because he knew that there were many treasures in Feng Wuji’s interstitial pouch. But now, the treasures belonged to Lin Yun.

When Shi Feng was about to turn around, he suddenly stopped and asked, “What’s the name of your sword?”

Since he carried an ancient sword behind him, anyone could tell that Shi Feng was a formidable swordsman. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have asked the name of Lin Yun’s sword.

Lin Yun replied, “The sword is called Flower Burial and I’m Flower Burial Lin Yun. I’m someone who buries flowers and people alike.”

Shi Feng muttered something before he raised his head at Lin Yun, “That’s a good name. But you better not compete with us for the Glorysun Spirit. You only have one sword, while there’s two of us.”

Hearing Shi Feng’s warning, Lin Yun didn’t bother replying. With that, Mo Han, Shi Feng, and Chen An entered the barrier.

Shortly after, everyone else passed through the barrier. Some of the people even turned back to look at Lin Yun. They knew that after this matter, the names Lin Yun and Flower Burial would spread like wildfire throughout the Azure Dragon Region.

Even though everyone else had left, Chen Xuan and Liu Yun were still staring at Lin Yun in disbelief. Liu Yun never imagined that Lin Yun would be so strong. When he recalled his attitude towards Lin Yun, he felt awkward.

Taking out a pot of dragon clan wine from his interspatial pouch, Lin Yun poured a cup for himself and said, “This is dragon clan wine. You guys can drink a cup before entering the barrier.”

When everyone heard that, their eyes lit up. Dragon clan wine was comparable to saint spiritual wine. It was extremely rare, but Lin Yun brought it out so nonchalantly. So everyone quickly came up to pour themselves a cup.

After drinking the wine, everyone felt the origin energy stirring within their bodies. In just a few short moments, their cultivation improved by leaps and bounds. Lin Yun naturally had no improvements, but it helped him recover most of his origin energy.

It turned out that Mo Han, Shi Feng, and Chen An were right. Lin Yun could only execute Azure Lotus one time. If he wanted to do it again, he would have to pay a great price. So he wouldn’t do it unless absolutely necessary. But the three of them didn’t know that it was only one of the Three Heavenly Divides.

“Lin Yun, the Bloodbone Realm will definitely come after you. Mo Han was right, the Bloodbone Realm is extremely terrifying. They have more than one genius in the third soul Heavenly Soul Realm, and their leader is even more terrifying,” said Chen Xuan while looking at Lin Yun with a grave expression. “It’s best for you to leave and not compete for the Glorysun Spirit.”

“It doesn't matter,” replied Lin Yun. Since he had run into the Glorysun Spirit, he had no reason to give it up. Furthermore, he wasn’t completely helpless against the Bloodbone Realm’s revenge.

“I have something that I would like to ask of you.” Lin Yun then took out the greater fortune martial techniques he gathered so far along with millions of astral pellets. Then, he requested Chen Xuan to give them to Fang Shaoyu, Zhu Qingshan, and Zhao Chen after returning to Thunderflame City. He knew that it was no longer possible for him to return to Thunderflame City.Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Don’t worry. Leave it to me.” Chen Xuan agreed without hesitation.

Liu Yun took a step forward and apologized, “Lin Yun, I would like to apologize for my attitude along the way. You’re the one who killed Feng Wuji, so you should have this Blood Sun Fruit.”

He knew that he would have died if Lin Yun didn’t stand up for him. Since Lin Yun saved his life, he was too embarrassed to keep the Blood Sun Fruit.

Looking at the Bloodsun Fruit in Liu Yun’s hand, Lin Yun replied, “No need. You can keep it for yourself. After all, you’ve grasped the spiritual sword intent. If your cultivation is too weak, you won’t be able to unleash the full power of the spiritual sword intent.”

“We should go.” Before Liu Yun could reply, Lin Yun lead the group towards the barrier. It didn’t matter if the Glorysun Spirit was sealed. Since it was one of the seven keys to the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm, he naturally had to take a look at it. But he knew that it wouldn’t be easy with Mo Han, Shi Feng, and Chen An around.
