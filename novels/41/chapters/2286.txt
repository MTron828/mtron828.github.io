Chapter 2287 - Living Legend

As spiritual energy began to pour in from the surroundings, this enveloped Lin Yun in a radiance that made him look sacred. An unimaginable power was accumulating within Lin Yun’s body, slowly transforming him. This transformation was the same as hammering steel to strengthen it.

Lin Yun’s cultivation was still rising, but he was calm as he continued to forge his saint origin and paid no attention to his cultivation’s increase.

Three days later, the saint origin was formed and forged into an Iris Flower with seventy-two petals. There were many naturally formed saint runes on the petals, containing Lin Yun’s insights in Sword Dao, Thunder Dao, Wind Dao, Azure Dragon Divine Physique, and the two sword canons. Once the floral runes took shape, another Sword Saint would appear in the Eastern Desolation, the Flower Burial Sword Saint.

With a boom, Lin Yun made a breakthrough and became a second-stage Saint Lord. A few minutes later, Lin Yun’s cultivation stopped at the pinnacle of the second-stage Saint Lord. When he opened his eyes, a light shone from them that lit up heaven and earth, with the surrounding space distorting and faint paintings appearing.

“A phenomenon!” Lin Yun happily rose to his feet. That meant that the world had recorded him as a legend. The nine modern legends were the Nine Emperors who stopped the Dark Era and established the Divine Dragon Empire. As a result, the Nine Emperors who were still alive were recognized as legends. But when Lin Yun made his breakthrough into a Saint, his past was recorded in this world.

“I’m also a legend?” Lin Yun muttered to himself before he shook his head, “I’m too weak when compared to the Nine Emperors. But since there’s a phenomenon, Heavenly Dao has remembered me.”

Heavenly Dao might be invisible, but everyone knew that it existed. That was why no one in the Kunlun Realm dared to break an oath made to Heavenly Dao. When Lin Yun raised his head, he could see how he ferociously drew his sword back in the Great Qin Empire, the Draconic Banquet, the Heavenly Path, the Profound Wither Island, becoming the champion of the Empyrean Ranking, Elysium Core Ranking, and how he killed a Great Saint outside the Ancient Barren Battlefield.

The pictures were like a book that recorded how he became first in the Empyrean, Elysium Core, Dragon Pulse, Samsara Edict, and Quasi-Saint Realm. His senior brother was the champion of three rankings, but he was the champion of five!

The book slowly closed up when Lin Yun was done observing it. Lin Yun then calmed himself down and gathered his saint energy in his right hand, “I have finally become a Saint.”

A saint radiance exploded like a dazzling sun when he clenched his fist.

“What power!” Lin Yun rejoiced, sensing that his strength had undergone a drastic transformation. If he faced the Ying River King now, he could easily suppress the latter, even without his sword intent. He no longer had to use a technique to win and could suppress him with raw strength.

“The clearest sign of a second-stage Saint Lord is the ability to condense dipper energy. Even the Astral Sword Intent can’t shatter dipper energy, so let me try it.” Lin Yun was bullied by dipper energy on the ninth. So, after becoming a second-stage Saint Lord, he couldn’t wait to try it. In the next second, his saint energy formed into dipper energy and surrounded him like a shield.

“It’s a pity that I have no one to try it out on.” Lin Yun thought of leaving after condensing the dipper energy. Then he thought about attacking himself, and laughed, “What am I thinking about? Who would punch themselves?”Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

He was too excited and forgot about how cautious he had been in the past. But he suddenly thought of a possibility and soared to the sky, throwing out a punch, “Well, I can give it a try.”

As he circulated the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon, two of him appeared, examining each other before laughing.

“You’re not allowed to retaliate!”

“You’re not allowed to retaliate!”

As they spoke, they laughed and threw a punch at each other. They both moved a few hundred meters back as the divine phoenix and heavenly dragon shattered. When the two combined, Lin Yun threw out a mouthful of blood, and his face became pale.

“It hurts…” Lin Yun looked at his caved-in chest and cracked dipper energy. He nearly killed himself earlier. He then bitterly smiled, “How embarrassing… At least Lil’ Purple isn’t around.”

“If I went full force with my sword intent, I could shatter my dipper energy,” Lin Yun muttered. If he went against the Ying River King, he wouldn’t have to do anything to bear the Ying River King’s attack.

The Ying River King is a Golden-Eyed Demonspirit at the fourth-stage Saint Lord, but his strength could be comparable to a fifth-stage Saint Lord. Lin Yun analysed and had a rough gauge of his strength. His cultivation alone allowed him to fight a fifth-stage Saint Lord without using his Divine Light Sword Intent.

After resting briefly, Lin Yun began performing his sword and movement techniques. After his breakthrough, the power of the Divine Firefly Sword had increased. Most importantly, the Carefree 9 Swords had transformed after he became a Saint. When he was done performing his sword techniques, he brought out his Sovereign Constellation, the eight primordial ominous beasts, and a sword. The summoning speed of his Sovereign Constellation had greatly increased.

“The Saint Realm is a huge transformation, and it looks like I have underestimated my strength.” After performing his martial techniques, Lin Yun had a rough guess. But even he had no idea how strong he had become. Not including Wang Muyan and Zhao Tianyu, the strongest opponent he came across was the Ying River King. But with Lin Yun’s strength, he didn’t have to compare himself to the Ying River King because the latter couldn’t even be considered a unit of measurement.

“If I go all out, the Ying River King might not be able to take a blow from me,” Lin Yun said. He wasn't too confident in his speculation since he hadn’t run into a fifth-stage Saint Lord before. The fifth stage of a Saint Lord was a transformation, not to mention the higher stages.

“There’s still a long way to go, but with the Solar Lunar Divine Rune, the Iris Secret Realm should transform after acquiring three Sovereign Divine Runes.” Lin Yun was looking forward to gathering the seven Sovereign Divine Runes. Speaking of the Iris Secret Realm, the excitement on his face gradually disappeared.

The Iris Sword Saint slew a deity while at the Saint Realm. He had just reached the Saint Realm, so it was best for him not to be too confident in himself.

“My cultivation is secondary. I must swiftly grasp the Nirvana Dao, or I will be in trouble facing someone who has grasped the Time or Space Daos.”

Lin Yun recalled how Wang Muyan used the power of time and space, relying on the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda. There were Nine Eternal Daos: Fate, Nirvana, Karma, Time, Space, Yin-Yang, Five Elements, Truth, and Chaos.

The Kunlun Realm was massive, and there were bound to be those who had grasped one of the eternal daos. Tian Xuanzi had grasped the Space Dao, the only one he revealed so far.

“Nirvana…” Lin Yun muttered as he walked over to the Fallen God Valley. The pressure coming from the Fallen God Valley couldn’t pose that much difficulty to him now as he looked down the abyss. After he became a Saint, he was more fearful while looking at the abyss. He could see the remains of a deity’s power in the abyss.

“It’s no wonder why Saints don't dare to intrude on the Fallen God Valley… This is dangerous,” Lin Yun muttered. He couldn’t sense how terrifying the Fallen God Valley was when he was in the Quasi-Saint Realm. When you stare into the abyss, the abyss stares back at you.

Lin Yun recollected his gaze and left, wanting to leave the God Burial Mountain Range.
