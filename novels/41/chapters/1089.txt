Chapter 1090 - Unimaginable Harvest

All of them were familiar with the Heavenly Path, so they had an understanding of it. Most powerful sects would go to the Heavenly Path to recruit disciples. Although it was a competition between geniuses from the lower realms, there were also those who stood out and eventually shined in Kunlun Realm.

Throughout history, there were some transcendent geniuses in the Heavenly Path who rose up to become legendary figures in Kunlun Realm. But someone like that would go directly to the Sword Sect. So why was Lin Yun at the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect? Even if he didn’t go to the Sword Sect, he should go to the other powerful sects instead. Could it be that Lin Yun was someone that no one wanted?

“You go with them, I’ll pay the Sect Master a visit,” said Feng Jue before he soared into the sky. He quickly disappeared after heading towards the main palace of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect.

The disciples who came to greet Feng Jue were filled with awe. After all, Feng Jue originated from the Sword Sect and had an impressive master. Then again, they naturally had no idea that Feng Jue was expelled from the Sword Sect.

“Lin Yun greets his fellow martial brothers and sisters,” smiled Lin Yun while cupping his hands together.

“Ye Ziling,” said the purple-clothed lady while she raised her brow to look at Lin Yun. Lin Yun was only in the fifth soul Heavenly Soul Realm, and in her eyes, Lin Yun probably didn’t even make it into the top 100 in the Heavenly Path. She couldn’t understand why Feng Jue went to pick up Lin Yun.

Could it be that Lin Yun was well connected? Did Feng Jue bring Lin Yun here because the latter’s talent wasn’t good enough? Although the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect had declined over the years, they didn’t just accept random people.

With this speculation, the purple-clothed lady’s eyes flashed with rage, “It’s still too early for you to call us martial brothers and sisters. The Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect might not be comparable to those transcendent sects, but this doesn’t mean we’ll take in anyone. Junior Brother Feng, take him to his residence.”

She left after she was done, without sparing Lin Yun another glance. After Ye Ziling left, a disciple by the name of Feng Zhang glanced at Lin Yun and asked, “Young Master Lin, what was your ranking on the Heavenly Path? Did you make it on the purple ranking?”

Purple ranking? It appears that these people were rather familiar with the Heavenly Path. Lin Yun replied honestly, “No.”

When he was done, the faces of everyone changed when they looked at Lin Yun. With disdain in his eyes, Feng Zhang continued, “The white ranking then?”

“No,” replied Lin Yun while shaking his head.

Upon hearing that Lin Yun didn’t even make it onto the white ranking, no one bothered concealing their disdain. Feng Zhang spoke bluntly, “You’re not even on the purple or white ranking, so why should I, an empyrean, lead the way for you?”

Although Lin Yun didn’t say a word, he memorized Feng Zhang’s name. Since Lin Yun didn’t say a word, Feng Zhang’s eyes flashed with ridicule, “I thought that you would be this transcendent genius since you came with Senior Feng Jue. But if that were true, you would have gone straight to the Sword Sect. Junior Brother Liu, you take him to his residence.”

The person who was called out wore an unsightly expression and looked around before speaking, “You, Junior Brother Bai, you do it. I have some matters to attend to right now.”

Just like that, everyone began to push and shove until a young man and lady were left. The young man also wore disdain on his face and said, “Junior Sister Wang, you do it.”

After he left, only the young lady remained. She looked to be seventeen or eighteen, but everyone could tell with a glance that she didn’t have much experience outside. This meant that even in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, she must be a pretty gentle person.

“I-I…” That young lady looked at Lin Yun bashfully. Clearly, she had no experience of receiving anyone before.

“Hehe, Lin Yun, you’re actually being looked down on. If anyone dared to treat me in this manner, I would simply kill them with one finger…” Lil’ Purple’s voice rang in Lin Yun’s mind as she began to boast.

“Senior Sister, how should I address you?” Lin Yun smiled. The young lady wasn’t old, but her cultivation was terrifying in the Empyrean Realm. Aside from Ye Ziling, she probably had the second strongest talent.

Everyone that left should have been the core disciples of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, especially Ye Ziling. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“My name is Wang Yuruo. Junior brother, are you really from the Heavenly Path?” Wang Yuruo let out a sigh of relief upon hearing Lin Yun’s words. After all, the Heavenly Path was legendary in Kunlun Realm, so Wang Yuruo was naturally curious about it.

“Yeah. Is there anything you want to know?” The two walked as they chatted and Wang Yuruo listened to Lin Yun’s experience with awe. Occasionally, she would exclaim, which made Lin Yun smile. If one of her senior brothers heard Lin Yun’s stories, they wouldn’t have been interested. After all, they weren’t even willing to lead the way for Lin Yun.

“Senior Sister Ruyuo, you haven’t left the sect before, right?” Lin Yun asked.

“Ah? Junior Brother Yun, how did you know that?” Wang Yuruo blinked her eyes with disbelief.

“That’s because you don’t have any killing aura around you,” smiled Lin Yun.

Wang Yuruo nodded her head and whispered, “I don’t like to kill. Senior Sister Ye said that I don’t have to do anything I don’t like. But senior sister had it tough the past few years. I wish I could do something to help…”

“I can help you with that,” said Lin Yun.

“Are you for real?” Wang Yuruo asked in astonishment.

“There’s nothing I can do to help you in terms of cultivation, but I can help you with building up a killing aura so that you won’t be in a disadvantageous position in the future when facing enemies,” smiled Lin Yun.

“Junior brother, you’ve killed a lot of people?” Wang Yuruo asked weakly.

“Anyone who can make it through the Heavenly Path has dyed their hands with blood. I’m no exception,” sighed Lin Yun. The number of people he killed in the past year probably far exceeded everyone from the Profound Amber Realm.

But the Heavenly Path was brutal. One had to fight in order to live or else they would die.

Wang Yuruo had shock flashing through her pupils because she could sense a shocking aura coming from Lin Yun. It was filled with desolation and age that many elders from the sect couldn’t compare to.

“ I’ll pay you a visit in the future when I’m free,” smiled Wang Yuruo.

“Anytime,” replied Lin Yun with a smile.

“Thank you then, Junior Brother Yun.” Wang Yuruo replied happily.

“Haha, I should be the one thanking you instead. It’s not everyday that an empyrean leads the way for me,” smiled Lin Yun, finding Wang Yuruo adorable.

When Wang Yuruo heard that, she thought that Lin Yun was still holding a grudge for what happened earlier. So she quickly whispered, “Junior Brother Yun, don’t hold it against Senior Sister Ye. She’s normally in seclusion and wouldn’t have come out if it weren’t for Senior Feng Jue’s arrival… She’s too prideful. If it wasn’t for the promise back then, she would be in the Sword Sect by now. Unfortunately, Senior Brother Feng Zhang and the rest are indeed a little too much. Hmph…”

An empyrean was qualified to put on airs, not to mention the core disciples of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. It was understandable that they would look down on Lin Yun when he was only in the Heavenly Soul Realm. Although he didn’t have his name on the white or purple ranking, he made it on the gold ranking and he was even the champion! Even the ten Realm Sons lost to him.

If Feng Zhang knew about it, he probably would have been scared to death. Not long later, the two arrived at Wind Bank Residence. It had a decent-sized courtyard behind the pavilion and it was located right next to a lake.

“This place is pretty remote. I’m sorry that you have to stay here for now. It’s just that you don’t have any status in the sect, and the sect’s rules are strict. Don’t wander around because it might bring you trouble,” said Wang Yuruo.

“This place is pretty good.” Lin Yun smiled. His new place was pretty quiet, and he was fond of it.

The two of them were comfortable with each other now, so Wang Yuruo said, “I’m going to head out, but you have to keep your promise. I’m going to come back and look for you once you settle down in the sect.”

“Of course.” Lin Yun nodded his head.

Just like that, Wang Yuruo left happily. But right at this moment, Lil’ Purple’s voice sounded out in his mind, “You playboy. You’re really shameless.”

“Do you know that you talk a lot?” retorted Lin Yun.

“Hmph, then reach the sixteenth stage quickly and condense the Iris Sacred Flame. I won’t bother you again after that,” said Lil’ Purple. She had said it a lot of times. Since she was woken by the Iris Sword Sutra, she could only break free after he reached complete mastery.

Lin Yun had sufficient cultivation and comprehension, so he could reach the sixteenth stage any time he wanted. However, he wasn’t in a rush because he had many other concerns.

“What do you think Feng Jue will talk about with the Sect Master? There must be another reason why they sent you here.” Lil’ Purple switched the topic. However, Lin Yun had no intention of talking to her as he started petting Lil’ Red.

Earlier when he left with Feng Jue, he was so close to leaving Lil’ Red behind. Lin Yun naturally knew what took Lil’ Red so long while he was saying goodbye to Yue Weiwei.

When they looked at each other, Lil’ Red chuckled before spitting out several interspatial pouches. There were a total of nine interspatial pouches that belonged to the Realm Sons. Lin Yun naturally recognized them and sucked in a cold breath. He couldn’t believe that Lil’ Red really managed to snatch all of the interspatial pouches under the eyes of the elders.

Furthermore, Lil’ Red even robbed the five Realm Sons who were injured. With the Imperial Feather Realm Son’s interspatial pouch that he had stolen, he now had each of the Realm Son’s interspatial pouches.
