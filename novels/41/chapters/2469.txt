Chapter 2470 - Qingfeng's Smile

When Lin Yun stepped on the path, he felt immense pressure crushing down on him.

“Heavenly might?” Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts and could sense that his sword intent was clashing with heaven. This was heaven’s fury, as though every step was blasphemy against heaven.

The sword ray Lin Yun gave off was like an actual sword, confronting heaven. But all of a sudden, Lin Yun felt that he was equal to heaven and the entire world was in his control. A light flashed across his eyes, and he muttered, “I see. No wonder master wants me only to use my sword intent.”

As soon as he finished, he shut his eyes, and his senses began to rise. Soon, he found himself in the sky, looking down at the land. When he lowered his head, he could see himself walking and countless streaks of light flashing past him.

But if anyone looked at it clearly, they could see streaks expanding and intertwining to form various scenes. Some blurred images looked like the future but were enveloped in fog.

“This is...” Lin Yun was shocked, and he couldn’t understand his current state.

“The streaks are your karma. Some must be severed, some must be resolved, and some will follow you for eternity. You’re currently one with heaven. As a swordsman, the sword is your heart; the path is to confront heaven. With your current cultivation, you can only sense it briefly on this path, and this is to hope that you can enter this state anytime you want. These are the secrets of Kunlun Realm’s swordsmen. Only you, your master, and I have reached this state.” Yu Qingfeng’s voice sounded in Lin Yun’s mind, shocking him greatly.

Fighting with heaven and fusing with dao. This was the ultimate secret of Kunlun Realm’s swordsmen, giving Lin Yun a colossal impact.

“Take a good look at it.” Yu Qingfeng’s voice disappeared.

Lin Yun carried on forward, and he could see more karma entangling around him. He maintained his state and walked, his Heavenly Desolate Sword Intent on confronting heaven and fusing with dao.

The pressure on him began to decrease, and his sword aura grew increasingly powerful, with his phenomenon as a myth reappearing. The myth felt like a blessing from heaven and earth, drawing exclamations in the Skysolute City.

“Lin Yun is going to succeed!”

“Even Emperors might not be able to walk this path successfully, but he’s having an easy time.”

“This is a surprise...”

“I’m afraid this path has more secrets!” The swordsmen began to discuss among themselves. This path wasn’t forbidden; anyone could walk on it. But there was a high chance that they couldn’t make it back alive. There weren’t many who succeeded, and they were all Emperors. Those beneath the Emperor Realm weren’t qualified to walk on this path.

Chu Liang, Jian Jue, and the other disciples of Skysolute City standing beside Dao Suspend Sword Saint were dumbfounded. That was especially for Chu Liang, who couldn’t contain his shock. He muttered, “What is he trying to do?”

After being defeated by Lin Yun, Chu Liang held it to heart and was unconvinced by his defeat. But this scene left him dumbfounded as he tried walking on it multiple times, and he didn’t even dare to walk now.

“No wonder master wants to see him...” The Dao Suspend Sword Saint figured everything out. He continued, “His attainment in the sword can be comparable to Emperors or even exceed them.”

This had nothing to do with the cultivation, but Lin Yun’s attainment of the sword was already comparable to Emperor Realm's experts.

“Junior Brother, you have gone further and further beyond our reach,” Jian Jingtian exclaimed, raising his head.

The arrogant youth that once stayed in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect was slowly reaching the peak of Kunlun Realm.

Ye Guhan smiled, “Since Junior Brother can go up on it, he has the strength to confront Emperors.”

The Thousand Plume Great Saint was shocked and said, “But he’s only in the Boundless Stage and hasn’t even reached the pinnacle of the Great Saint Realm.”

Ye Guhan smiled, “Junior Brother had refined the Heavenly Dragon Bone, and his cultivation can be neglected. It’s just a matter of time before he reaches the peak. He might even be able to reach the peak of the Great Saint Realm when he comes down.”

Yu Qingfeng sat in the clouds, smiling and not looking like someone who was going to die.

When Lin Yun reached the clouds, the fusion state disappeared, and his boundless sword aura fused into a ray, fusing into his sword heart. That was the Heavenly Dao Radiance!

“I succeeded?” Lin Yun knew that with this Heavenly Dao Radiance, he could go into the heaven and sword fusion state even after leaving the mountain. But before he could try it, Lin Yun quickened his footsteps and came before Yu Qingfeng. He was filled with questions.

“Are you going to dissolve yourself into dao? What about the Feng Qingyu I met outside Kunlun Realm?” Lin Yun asked.

Yu Qingfeng smiled, “It’s real. As for Feng Qingyu, you saw outside Kunlun Realm, he’s also real.”

“So only Kunlun Realm’s Yu Qingfeng will dissolve into dao, and Feng Qingyu will remain,” Lin Yun said, heaving in relief.

Yu Qingfeng nodded upon hearing that.

“What’s going on?” Lin Yun asked.

“It’s nothing profound. I told you outside Kunlun Realm that it was my opportunity, allowing me to sever my karma and rebirth outside Kunlun Realm. The one you saw was Yu Qingfeng when he was seventeen years old...” Yu Qingfeng explained.

Lin Yun finally understood what was happening, and his speculation was correct.

Pouring a cup of wine for him, Yu Qingfeng smiled, “Let’s drink first. I’ll tell you a story.”

“I’m all ears,” Lin Yun said, raising his cup.

“A thousand years ago, I met the same problem you faced. What is the sword intent beyond the ninth-grade? I also wondered if the Sword Ancestor found that answer,” Yu Qingfeng said. “But I’m not in a hurry because I’ve touched the threshold of Truth Dao, and I could step into it at any time. But I’m not willing to give up...when I was wandering around Kunlun Realm, I met a person...”

Yu Qingfeng stopped and smiled, “Don’t you find it weird that a bladesman wants to teach me sword technique? I’m the Sword Emperor, and he wants to teach me. I naturally laughed it off. After that, I would run into him from time to time in the next few hundred years. But if you ran into someone repeatedly for the third time, you would find it weird, right?”

“Who is that person?” Lin Yun asked with his curiosity piqued.

“I don’t know. There are no records in the books, not even the records of the various holy lands and clans. Many years ago, I finally found bits and pieces of that person’s record from Xiao Clan’s record of the Blue Dragon King and was terrified by what I saw. But when I tried to look for him again, he was nowhere to be found...”

Lin Yun was fully submerged in the story, while Yu Qingfeng smiled, “Look at the manners of the youth now. I’m an old man about to die, and he’s unwilling to pour me a cup of tea.”

Lin Yun cursed inwardly when he heard that. How was Yu Qingfeng going to die? He even bluffed all the disciples in the Skysolute City. But as he was curious, he could only smile, “Senior, you carry on while I pour a cup of tea for you.”

“That’s more like it. That person was known as the Pang Emperor. I found out that he’s an expert who transcended this era from the records of the Blue Dragon King. He was as mysterious as the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain, and even the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity had to address him as senior. He was known as the Springsnow Bladesman,” Yu Qingfeng smiled.

He continued, “Do you know how shocked I was back then? I tried finding him and couldn’t find him anywhere. When I was going to feel despair, I saw him in the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain. He asked me if I wanted to learn the sword from him, to which I agreed. Don’t you find it weird that the Sword Emperor wants to learn how to use the sword from a bladesman?”

Lin Yun was shocked upon hearing that, and he didn’t expect there to be such a person in Kunlun Realm. He asked curiously, “How strong is he?”

Yu Qingfeng said with a grave expression, “Deep and unfathomable. I can’t imagine his strength, and he might’ve even surpassed the Ancestral Realm, unaffected by heavenly dao. He didn’t want to get involved in karma, but he said I looked like an acquaintance he knew, which was why he helped me. He helped me sever my karma and undergo rebirth outside the Kunlun Realm. He said he would teach me how to learn the sword, but he didn’t teach me anything. He only gave me a sword engraved with Firefly on it.”

“Isn’t that the sword used by the Sword Ancestor? The Sword Ancestor also created the Divine Firefly Sword. That means...he has a relationship with the Sword Ancestor?” Lin Yun asked.

“Probably, but I can’t meet the Sword Ancestor anymore. This is my opportunity; are you envious of it?” Yu Qingfeng winked.

Lin Yun was speechless because he never expected the Sword Emperor to have such a playful side to him.

“When I first met you, you said that you would challenge everyone in my Skysolute City one day, and that came true,” Yu Qingfeng smiled. “But this also proved that I have good eyesight.”

“For so many years, you have been my master’s guardian, and we’re a family,” Lin Yun said.

“You’re not exactly wrong. I’ve guarded the Ancient Barren Domain for three thousand years, and it’s time to do what I want. But I have to clean up the mess after I leave. Before I dissolve into dao, let me give you some help. See that moon?” Yu Qingfeng smiled.

Following Yu Qingfeng's direction, Lin Yun looked at the moon in the sky. That might seem like a moon, but it was a sun. All along, Skysolute City had two suns, and it was a spectacular scene of Skysolute City.

“A long time ago, my sword intent was overflowing. If you stayed in Kunlun Realm and the Heavenly Path couldn’t be reforged, your sword intent would also overflow at some point,” Yu Qingfeng said with a grave expression. He continued, “I’ll give this moon to you.”

Lin Yun was shocked as he looked at the bright sun. He asked, “Can I even bear it?”

“What’s the problem with it? Honestly speaking, there’s nothing I can do to that bitch even if I don’t fear her,” Yu Qingfeng smiled. “If you accept my inheritance, you must teach her a lesson. It wasn’t easy for her either, but she was too strong. Even if she knew she was wrong, a stronger person couldn’t persuade her. Do you know what I mean?”

Lin Yun’s face changed, and he knew the Sword Emperor was talking about the Empress. After bearing what he said, he had no hatred for the Empress but pity and helplessness. This was to tell him not to take her life even if he was stronger than her.

Yu Qingfeng muttered, “No matter what, the nine of us were together and suppressed the Dark Era. We’re all prepared to die when we do it.”

Lin Yun nodded and could understand what Yu Qingfeng meant.

“Lin Yun, I’m going to leave now...” Yu Qingfeng smiled as he stood up.

When Lin Yun heard that, he couldn’t help feeling a little sorrow.

“But we will meet again, won’t we?” Yu Qingfeng smiled.

“We will surely meet again,” Lin Yun said.

“Lin Yun, I’m inferior compared to you. I’m merely a coward who ran away. I wasn’t as talented as the Southern Emperor, nor did I have the Empress’ ambition. I only want to become a child and live a carefree life. But I became the Sword Emperor without knowing, growing from a youth to a man. You must be curious why I want to dissolve myself into dao, right? I’m doing it for you,” Yu Qingfeng said, looking at Lin Yun with a complicated gaze. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

When he finished, Yu Qingfeng pointed at Lin Yun’s forehead before the latter could react. As Yu Qingfeng gave off a dazzling radiance, his clothes began to flutter. From today onwards, there would be no more Yu Qingfeng in Kunlun Realm, and he smiled as he disappeared.
