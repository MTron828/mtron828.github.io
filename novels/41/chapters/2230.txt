Chapter 2231 - Slaying A Saint

Kui’erdo looked at Lin Yun with an ‘amicable’ expression and smiled, “Why didn’t I notice it before? It’s the famous Flower Burial.”

“Since you know he’s Flower Burial, why are you still standing here?!” Lil’ Purple said coldly.

Kui’erdo was briefly stunned and felt that something wasn’t right somewhere. Flower Burial might be famous, but this was the Heavenly Void. So shouldn’t a Quasi-Saint be afraid of him, a second-stage Sword Lord, instead?

He smiled, “You must be joking. I think there is room for negotiation between us. The Kunlun Realm will undergo a great change. You might be human cultivators, but you probably don’t have a good relationship with the Divine Dragon Empire. Why don’t we join hands to overthrow the Divine Dragon Empire? As long as you agree, my Demonspirit will help when your master undergoes his tribulation.”

Lin Yun merely sneered in his heart. If a Demonspirit appears, his senior brother might join hands with Tian Xuanzi to kill the Demonspirit first. But he didn’t immediately reply since he accumulated his sword intent and the two sword canons.

The Great Profound Sword Canon and Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon circulated as the saint aura within his body grew even more powerful, with a terrifying power filling up his entire body.

The Netherflower bloomed in his violet palace with a heavenly dragon and divine phoenix coiling around each other.

As his blood began to boil like magma, Lin Yun felt like an ancient cauldron as he continued to circulate the power of his Azure Dragon Divine Physique. He sneered, “Why did I hear that you guys have blamed the death of that Golden-Eyed Demonspirit on me?”

“That’s a misunderstanding. Our Ying River King holds you with high regard, and he feels that even Yu Qingfeng can’t beat you once you’ve fully grown up,” Kui’erdo smiled.

“You guys think highly of me,” Lin Yun smiled. The two might seem to be chatting happily, but they were both prepared to make a move.

Since Lin Yun feared Kui’erdo’s second-stage Saint Lord cultivation, he didn’t dare to attack first. Coincidentally, Kui’erdo shared the same thoughts as well.

“Let’s end our casual talk here, Flower Burial. If you’re willing to hand over the Othershore Flower, we can still be considered friends,” Kui’erdo smiled.

“We’ve never been friends,” Lin Yun replied.

“I knew that you wouldn’t give up obediently. Lin Yun, don’t you know that your value is even higher than the Othershore Flower, hahaha!” Kui’erdo made his move as he waved his hands together and summoned ten-odd Saint Realm demonic corpses from the surroundings. The reason why he bought time was simple, to capture Lin Yun alive.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Let’s go!” But Lil’ Purple and Lil’ Red naturally wouldn’t let Kui’erdo achieve his goal. They attacked even without Lin Yun speaking up, luring all the Saint Realm demonic corpses away.

“Star Resurrection Transformation!” Kui’erdo was done preparing as the vertical eye on his forehead opened up while he reached out with his hand. Shortly after, ghostly figures appeared around him, manifesting a giant palm with descending starlight. It looked like he had grasped thousands of stars in his palm, and his saint energy sparked a chain explosion as the stars were annihilated.

This was the ultimate technique of the Demonspirit Clan, which was comparable to a low-grade dragon spirit martial technique in the Kunlun Realm, possessing unbelievable power. Kui’erdo reached a high level with this attack, and he could create a thousand stars in his palm. When he attacked, this power far exceeded the power of a second-stage Saint Lord. It could easily tear apart their dipper aura.

“I have underestimated you. You’re comparable to two Horizon Hawk Saint Lords.” Lin Yun was fearless, appearing to have not made a move, but he had already reacted. He executed the Divine Sunchasing Art. Space was being stretched like a bow beneath his feet, and his speed had increased, leaving behind spatial fluctuations as he dodged the palm.

“How is this possible?” Kui’erdo was shocked because Lin Yun’s movement technique had touched the surface of Space Dao, and that was something that only Saints possessed. He became anxious, then chased after Lin Yun, “I don’t believe that I can’t catch you!”

One fled as one chased, but Lin Yun dodged this time, and Kui’erdo couldn’t touch Lin Yun no matter how he tried.

“You’re too slow!” Lin Yun smiled as he drew his sword, pouring his sword aura into it and crushing the black palm.

Kui’erdo quickly avoided, saying, “To possess such a movement technique at the Quasi-Saint Realm, you have given me a huge surprise.”

He no longer planned on capturing Lin Yun. Instead, he planned to injure Lin Yun before taking him away. Multiple spheres appeared with him in the center, shining brightly like stars. They were enveloping him and Lin Yun. When the spheres descended, Kui’erdo’s strength increased again, and his demonic aura illuminated a hundred miles of radius. With a sinister smile, his palm descended, “Thousand Stars Destruction!”

As the Flower Burial Sword trembled, Lin Yun was forced to retreat a few hundred meters from the sheer force of this palm. He was also injured, but he continued to accumulate his sword intent and saint aura within his body.

I’m still lacking when compared to a second-stage Saint Lord. I can barely take this attack head-on with my divine physique. Otherwise, I would have died a long time ago. Lin Yun inwardly muttered as he raised the evaluation of Kui’erdo to a third-stage Saint Lord in his heart.

Lil’ Purple and Lil’ Red were facing the demonic corpses, and he didn’t have the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella in his hand.

Although he had the Buddhist Emperor Golden Lotus Spear, he wanted to face Kui’erdo himself and understand his limit.

“Flower Burial, do you know the difference between a Saint and a Quasi-Saint? You’re nothing without a Sovereign Saint Artifact,” Kui’erdo smiled.

Lin Yun had long recovered from his injuries with his divine physique, so he smiled, “Your palm only helped me scratch an itch. Is that the best you got?”

“Haha, still being so stubborn. If I didn’t exhaust my life force and vitality because of the Othershore Flower, I would’ve killed you with that palm,” Kui’erdo sneered and fully unleashed his strength along with his constellation and saint soul’s radiance. The aura he gave off suddenly became terrifying as it came crashing down towards Lin Yun.

If this attack struck Lin Yun, he would be heavily injured even with a divine physique. Under this pressure, Lin Yun faintly sensed a sword intent, and a dao flower bloomed in his eyes. But just when he wanted to look, the dao flower had disappeared.

He wasn’t surprised since he knew that it was the Sword Dao, and he could sense the existence of the Sword Dao recently. But the effects weren’t that great, so he would be fortunate to grasp it. Since he decided to comprehend Sword Dao in this battle, petals bloomed as he destroyed the incoming palm.

When Lin Yun moved, it was like he was dancing on a blade and Lin Yun’s sword would contain a hint of Sword Dao whenever he swung it. It was dangerous, and the incoming attacks would injure him if he didn’t have the Sword Dao empowering his sword.

But Lin Yun liked this feeling, swinging the Flower Burial Sword in a battle of life and death, and he soon sank into this feeling.

It didn’t take long for them to exchange over a hundred moves as Kui’erdo gasped for breath. He initially wanted to rely on his cultivation and exhaust Lin Yun to death, but he soon noticed that the situation wasn’t right. Lin Yun’s power seemed endless, and a bizarre power would shatter his attack every time Lin Yun exhausted himself.

Kui’erdo came to his senses and roared, “You’re using me to comprehend Sword Dao!”

This was a humiliation. Not only did a Quasi-Saint not use his full strength in a fight with him, but he was even used by Lin Yun as a tool to comprehend Sword Dao.

“Not bad, you’ve discovered it,” Lin Yun smiled.

“How dare you humiliate me!” Kui’erdo became furious as thousands of stars entered his body, and he charged at Lin Yun.

“Four Horizon Hawk Saint Lords, that should be your limit,” Lin Yun smiled. “I won’t hold back anymore now.”

The power of the Great Profound Sword Canon and Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon began accumulating before they exploded simultaneously, with Lin Yun giving off a dazzling radiance. His sword ray made the sky light up like the day with a terrifying sword aura heading towards Kui’erdo, making the latter throw out a mouthful of blood and take a few steps back from this power.

This naturally shocked Kui’erdo since he couldn’t believe that a Quasi-Saint was so strong.

“Myriad Swords Unite!” He was shocked, but Lin Yun wasn’t surprised since he had already predicted that Kui’erdo would be forced back. He stepped forth as the sword ray spiraled, and the Flower Burial Sword was thrust towards Kui’erdo’s chest.

A hole was created in Kui’erdo’s dipper aura as he was sent flying away. But Lin Yun didn’t let him catch his breath and swung his sword again, which felt like a river that flowed from ancient times. As the firefly’s light shone on the sword tip, the light suddenly grew even more dazzling than a star.

Kui’erdo’s dipper aura exploded with two consecutive stabs, and he was covered in injuries from the sword ray. Even his constellation and saint soul’s radiance were shattered. He still wanted to put up a resistance, but Lin Yun’s overbearing sword intent poured into his body after he lost the protection of his dipper aura.

Kui’erdo’s body exploded into a blood mist, his bones shattered, and his constellation destroyed. The only thing that he left behind was an eyeball that wanted to escape.

This scene stunned Lin Yun before he no longer held back and released his Quasi-Divine Light Sword Intent. In his eyes, sword intent seemed to be an invisible force that caused space to distort and pulled the eyeball that fled a hundred miles away back, “Come back!”

“No! No! No!” Kui’erdo’s remnant saint soul in the eyeball screamed in despair, but he could do nothing about it.

As a golden light shone from Lin Yun’s eyes, he swung his sword and destroyed that eyeball. With that, a second-stage Saint Lord was killed. The demonic corpses attacking Lil’ Purple and Lil’ Red froze with Kui’erdo’s death before they faded into ashes.

Sheathing his sword, Lin Yun muttered, “If I include that eyeball, it’s not an exaggeration to gauge him as five Horizon Hawk Saint Lords.”
