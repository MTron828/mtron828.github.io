Chapter 1183 - Ice Phoenix Bracelet (1)

Everything took place in a split second, and Lin Yun’s strong stance had left everyone dumbfounded. Yan Zijing gave him a palm and was then destroyed by a punch. The maid wanted to dig his eyes out, but her eyes were destroyed instead.

The strong stance suffocated everyone present. Even the little miss was trembling in fear by the corner. She had never experienced this in her lifetime. Not only did Lin Yun not give her face, but he didn’t even go easy on her maids. She knew that if it wasn’t for the Dragon Pulse Realm expert protecting her, Lin Yun definitely wouldn’t have left so easily.

But Lin Yun’s words were still piercing her ears. She had to give him back the bracelet or else she would have to pay the prices. She knew that the words weren’t directed to her, but to the hidden Dragon Pulse Realm. Lin Yun was telling him that he wasn’t afraid of him.

“Get lost! All of you, get lost! None of you are allowed to speak about what happened today or I’ll cut off your tongues!” The little princess of the Feng Clan roared furiously, which made all the swordsmen flee in fear.

Yan Zijing’s friends also dug him out of the ground before they left. After everyone left, a grey-clothed elder appeared in the room and waved his hand to get all the maids to leave.

“Butler Hong, why didn’t you kill him?!” The little princess’ gaze became cold as she looked at the old man. She gnashed her teeth and lost control of her emotions. “My grandfather said that you have to listen to me. Catch him right now! I want to feed him to the dogs!”

“He’s someone recommended by the patriarch of the Huang Clan. The patriarch of the Huang Clan is friends with your grandfather, so I can’t touch him,” said the old man, trying to comfort this princess of the Feng Clan.

“But he injured my beloved dog, blinded my maid, and he even dared to threaten me before all these people! I’ve never been bullied in this manner in my lifetime, so I don’t care!” The princess roared.

“I can’t touch him in the city,” said Butler Hong.

The little princess’ eyes lit up when she heard that, “Doesn’t that mean that you can catch him back as long as he leaves the city?”

The butler didn’t reply, but she knew what that meant.

“Good! Break his legs for me! I want him to crawl in front of me like a dog!” The princess said coldly with killing intent filled in her pupils.

Hearing that, the old man nodded and left quietly. In his view, Lin Yun was only relying on the patriarch of the Huang Clan. The Huang Clan was strong in this city as their influence radiated over nine prefectures. They were comparable to the Azure Rock Hidden Sword Pavilion, but it was a different story outside the city.

In front of a Dragon Pulse Realm expert like himself, a small fry in the Heavenly Soul Realm was nothing. This was his confidence as a Dragon Pulse Realm expert. He didn’t even put those in the Empyrean Realm or Divine Core Realm in his eyes.

After leaving the manor, Lin Yun took in a deep breath because he knew that there was no way he could finish the task given to him by the old geezer. Without the invitation, he wouldn’t be able to participate in the Sword Assembly. But getting him to kneel to obtain an invitation also wasn’t something that Lin Yun could accept.

Even now, he was still disgusted by the princess of the Feng Clan. At the same time, the bracelet that Lil’ Purple had spent an entire night making had gone to waste. He had completely offended the Feng Clan on this trip, and he would have to make a trip personally if they weren’t willing to hand over the bracelet.

At that time, he would cause a huge incident. But Lin Yun wasn’t bothered about it because he would never regret any decision he made. He just needed to come up with a way to make it up to the old geezer.

Thinking about it, Lin Yun felt relieved. Maybe it was because he had no interest in the Sword Assembly, to begin with. If he could leave now, wouldn't that mean that he would be able to make it back to the Profound Azure Prefecture in time with the Profound Astral Bird’s speed?

When he returned to his residence, he shared his experience in Feng Clan’s manor with Luo Hua. With a calm expression, Lin Yun said, “I probably won’t be able to participate in the Sword Assembly now. If there are no surprises, we’ll be able to leave tomorrow.”

But Luo Hua fell into silence when she heard that and drummed her fingers on the desk. If anyone could see her face under her veil, they would realize that her eyes were flickering coldly with rage.

“It looks like the temper of this princess is really big. She probably won’t return the bracelet, and I’m afraid you won’t be able to leave tomorrow,” said Luo Hua.

“Then I’ll have to pay her a visit. I already told her that she’ll pay the price if she doesn’t return the bracelet,” said Lin Yun calmly. He didn’t have a good impression of the so-called princess of the Feng Clan.

“How about this? If you trust me, let me handle this matter . Why don’t you wait for my news? At that time, we can decide if we should stay or go,” Luo Hua said. Although she was asking, she was speaking in an unquestionable tone. Clearly, she intended to get involved.

“It’s alright.” Lin Yun shook his head and continued, “That woman is too overbearing and unreasonable. Furthermore, she’s vicious and isn’t easy to deal with.”

He knew that Luo Hua had a shocking origin, but this was Azure Rock County. So she might not be able to intimidate them because she was alone, not to mention that the princess of the Feng Clan wasn’t a reasonable person. That brat was feeding people to dogs, so Lin Yun didn’t want Luo Hua to take this risk.

“She’s unreasonable?” Luo Hua merely smiled.

After she left, Lil’ Purple flew out of the sword box. She looked exhausted, but she still wore a smile on her face, “Lin Yun, I’m starting to like you now. You were really overbearing in the Feng Clan’s manor, and you now have a tiny little bit of my grace from back then.”

“But your bracelet…” Lin Yun said with his brows locked together.

But before he could finish, Lil’ Purple had already interrupted him, “It’s just a bracelet, and there’s nothing too impressive about it.”

Lin Yun merely smiled when he heard that. He knew that it wasn’t an ordinary bracelet because Lil’ Purple had spent a lot of time creating it, not to mention that it contained the rhyme of the ice phoenix clan. In this world, there wouldn’t be another ice phoenix who would prepare a bracelet so meticulously.

This meant that this Ice Phoenix Bracelet was probably the only one in the world and it was unique.

“You’re really not going to participate in the Sword Assembly?” Lil’ Purple asked. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Hearing that, Lin Yun merely sighed and stayed quiet.
