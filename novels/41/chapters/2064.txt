Chapter 2065 - Borrow Swords

No one expected the battle to be so intense. The last clash between Ye Qingitan and Gu Zijing made everyone feel suffocating. They all felt that it was unbelievable that Ye Qingtian had grasped nine sword forms of the Divine Firefly Sword’s second section before stepping onto the saint path.

They initially thought that Gu Zijing would be undefeated with the Myriad Astral Eye and that secret technique which summoned the ice phoenix. But who could’ve thought that Gu Zijing would still lose the fight? If Ye Qingtian executed the last sword, Gu Zijing might have even lost his life. This was because Ye Qingtian’s last sword was too unbelievably powerful.

Gu Zijing heaved a sigh of relief in low spirits as he looked at Ye Qingtian. His bright eyes were dim at this moment.

“He looks really pitiful. The Snowfrost Saint Palace might have something to do with me. Lin Yun, don’t let him stay in this state for too long. Pass my words to him…” Lil’ Purple’s voice from the Iris Secret Realm surprised Lin Yun. But he still followed her request and secretly whispered to Gu Zijing.

“This?!” Gu Zijing squinted his eyes after hearing what Ye Qingtian said, and he raised his head to look at Ye Qingtian in disbelief.

Lin Yun just told him the flaws in the Ice Phoenix Secret Art that he just used and the method to perfect them. This naturally shocked Gu Zijing, and he wondered how Ye Qingtian knew that.

The secret technique to summon the Ice Phoenix was the Descending Phoenix Sacred Canon, which was in the hands of his master, the Ice Emperor. It was the ultimate technique of the Snowfrost Saint Palace, limited to only a few people.

Most importantly, the secret technique was taught to him by the Ice Emperor, but this meant that the Ice Emperor’s Descending Phoenix Sacred Canon wasn’t complete. And yet Lin Yun managed to complete it in just a few words. The Ice Emperor would probably be shocked if he knew about this.

“H-How do you know about that?” Gu Zijing couldn’t help asking.

Lin Yun was surprised that what Lil’ Purple told him was right. It was rare for Lil’ Purple to be so reliable. He asked with a smile, “Everyone has their own secrets, don’t they?”

Gu Zijing came to his senses and cupped his fists together, “I’m grateful for this. Please come to the Snowfrost Saint Palace if there’s an opportunity. I believe my master will personally welcome you.”

“Okay,” Lin Yun replied.

“You must come no matter what!” Gu Zijing said even after leaving, he had forgotten about the Sword Assembly.

Lin Yun said nothing about this because he didn’t dare to carelessly go to the Snowfrost Saint Palace. If Lil’ Purple couldn’t save him, he would be finished.

“Actually, I have a speculation. The Freezing Chill Divine Rune of the Seven Sovereign Runes might be in the hands of the Ice Emperor,” Lil’ Purple said.

“How are you sure about that?”

“Intuition!”

After Gu Zijing left, Lin Yun sat with his legs crossed and swallowed a pellet to treat his injuries.

“In the end, Ye Qingtian is stronger and has grasped the ninth sword form of the Divine Firefly Sword.” Jiang Yunting sighed in the palace. He had already guessed the result. He didn’t guess the process because he didn’t expect Ye Qingtian to grasp nine sword forms of the Divine Firefly Sword’s second section. Since each form of the thirteen sword forms were stronger than the previous ones, the difficulty of grasping them would also increase.

“After today, Ye Qingtian will become famous throughout the Kunlun Realm,” someone exclaimed in the palace.

“Even Gu Zijing lost. Does that mean he’s first?” Feng Shengling softly said.

There was a silence in the palace and Feng Shaoyu’s face became ugly. This was something that the Sword Alliance didn’t want to see, especially the Hidden Sword Manor, the host of the Sword Assembly.

Did this mean the first of the Sword Alliance would go to the hands of an outsider again? It happened once twenty years ago, and now, twenty years later.

Skysolute City swiftly caught up to them, placing them in an awkward position. Not to mention an outsider became first in their Sword Assembly, and they would have a tough time raising their heads in the future.

“We still have Brother Jiang, so we’re not exactly without anyone left,” Zhao Wuji said.

Those words took everyone aback, and they couldn’t help turning to look at Jiang Yunting. After all, Jiang Yunting was a genius who had grasped the Astral Sword Intent. Not to mention that Ye Qingtian had exposed enough trump cards, but there might be a chance of winning for Jiang Yunting if he was willing to fight.

“Jiang Yunting… you…” Feng Shaoyu said.

“Stop right there!” Jiang Yunting refused, waving his hand. He said, “I’m not his opponent, at least not now. Let’s not mention if he has any other trump cards left. Even if he has no trump cards left, he can easily defeat me with one sword.”

Jiang Yunting didn’t have the secret technique of the Ice Emperor’s lineage. He would be defeated if Ye Qingtian empowered his attacks with the Azure Dragon Sword Heart and executed the Moon Reflection Mirror.

Going to challenge Ye Qingtian was no different from asking to be humiliated. He knew that Zhao Wuji had no good intentions by saying that.

Feng Shaoyu’s gaze became dim, and he could only sigh. As footsteps sounded, the defeated Gu Zijing returned.

“I’m sorry for disappointing you, Young Manor Master.” Gu Zijing cupped his fists together with guilt, but his expression was calm, and he didn’t look as low-spirited as he was before.

Feng Shaoyu bitterly smiled, “Brother Gu, you have already done your best.”

Gu Zijing shook his head and said nothing. Everyone in the palace also fell silent.

Although they didn’t want to admit it, Ye Qingtian had become first in the Sword Assembly, and those who laughed at him became a laughingstock. That was especially the case for Zhao Wuji, who was wearing an awkward expression. After all, Zhao Wuji was the mastermind who spread the rumors about Ye Qingtian.

He felt that Ye Qingtian was a clown back then, but now he was the clown. Not only was Ye Qingtian the second Jian Jingtian, he was even more talented than Jian Jingtian from twenty years ago!

As time slowly flowed under the silence, Lin Yun slowly stood up and descended from the giant sword. He looked around before asking, “Does anyone else wish to challenge me?”

The entire venue fell silent with everyone from the Sword Alliance lowering their heads. For fifteen minutes, no one dared to say a word. The venue was dead silent, looking as though time had stopped.

“Young Manor Master, since no one wishes to challenge me, I believe I have become first, right?” Lin Yun raised his head to look at Feng Shaoyu in the palace.

Feng Shaoyu smiled and said, “Does anyone else wish to challenge Ye Qingtian? If no one stands forth, the champion of this Sword Assembly will go to the Heavenly Dao Sect’s Ye Qingtian!”

He was just asking as part of the procedure. If someone was willing to challenge Ye Qingtian, he or she would’ve stepped forth long ago.

When no one replied after a few minutes, Feng Shaoyu took a deep breath to calm himself down and declared, “The Heavenly Dao Sect is as expected as the leader of the Eastern Desolation’s holy lands. Since no one wants to challenge Ye Qingtian, I hereby announce that the champion of this Sword Assembly is the Heavenly Dao Sect’s Ye Qingtian!”

His voice was deep and spread out, causing disciples of the Sword Alliance to feel conflicted. They were initially jealous, but they could say nothing about it after Ye Qingtian defeated Zhao Wuji and Gu Zijing.

Ye Qingtian had become the champion, and swordsmen spoke with their swords. Feng Shaoyu spread his arms apart and descended from the sky with two sword servants following behind him. One of the sword servants was carrying a sword as the three came over to Ye Qingtian.

Pointing at the sword box, Feng Shaoyu said, “My grandfather personally forged this sword, spending a hundred years to imprint two glory spirits, using a hundred types of demonic beast blood, and a meteorite to forge it. The name of this sword is Heavenly Dipper.”

Feng Shaoyu naturally couldn’t bear to give it away, and he paused for a long time after he talked about it. A long time later, he said in a conflicted tone, “It belongs to you now. Aside from that, you can also look through our library and take a sword technique, along with thirty Great Solar Saint Pellets and thirty Great Lunar Saint Pellets.”

Everyone took a deep breath when they heard that and enviously looked at Ye Qingtian. Not even the eighteen sword dao holy lands could take out this reward. Only the Hidden Sword Manor could afford it. This was because the swords forged by the Hidden Sword Manor were famous in the market, which built them a fortune.

“You can try it,” Feng Shaoyu waved his hand. He was feeling conflicted, but he had to maintain his etiquette. This was a glorious moment for a swordsman, and the two sword servants opened the sword box, revealing the Twospirit Glory Saint Artifact, Heavenly Dipper.

Lin Yun’s eyes shone as he stared at the sword box. He had to admit that the Hidden Sword Manor was really generous.

“There’s no need. Since the Hidden Sword Manor is willing to take it out, I believe this sword is extraordinary.” Lin Yun took the sword out but had no intention of drawing it.

This made Feng Shaoyu frown. Even the surrounding audience members were curious, since they had no idea what Ye Qingtian was trying to do.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“What is he doing?”

“He said the sword was extraordinary, but he wasn’t even willing to look at it. Isn’t he too cocky?”

“Is he trying to put the young manor master in a difficult position?”

“Yeah. Didn’t the Hidden Sword Manor hold this event to display their ability to forge swords? Isn’t Ye Qingtian too much?”

The corner of Feng Shaoyu’s lips twitched. He suppressed his anger and smiled, “Brother Ye, testing the sword is our tradition. You have to let everyone here take a look at this sword because my grandfather spent a hundred years to forge this sword.”

Lin Yun bitterly smiled because even though he wanted to draw the sword, he didn’t dare. He feared that the sword would snap because of his ‘broken sword’ physique.

“Why don’t you give it a try yourself?” Lin Yun suggested.

Feng Shaoyu dropped his smile and his face darkened. He questioned, “You want me to draw the sword for you? Ye Qingtian, who do you think you are? I have put up with you for a long time, so you can leave if you don’t want to test the sword.”

As he spoke, Feng Shaoyu released an aura at the Quasi-Saint Realm. He was already furious that an outsider became the Sword Assembly's champion, and he couldn’t bother putting up an act now.

“I’m afraid I still can’t leave,” Lin Yun said. “I’m not here for Heavenly Dipper. If I remember correctly, the champion is qualified to borrow swords from the Hidden Sword Manor.”

“You want to borrow swords?” Feng Shaoyu turned around with shock on his face. Not only he, but everyone else was also dumbfounded because it wasn’t easy to borrow swords.

“I wish to borrow the Sovereign Saint Sword, Cauldron,” Lin Yun said as he stared Feng Shaoyu in the eyes. His voice was gentle, but his words shocked everyone.
