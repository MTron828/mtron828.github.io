Chapter 1172 - Not All Like Are The Same

Ye Ziling and Wang Yuruo arrived outside Lin Yun’s residence. When they reached the gate, Lin Yun had already been waiting outside. Seeing Lin Yun, Wang Yuruo’s eyes lit up as she pounced over, “Senior Brother Lin!”

Lin Yun was instantly infected by her joyfulness and smiled, “You are already grown up, so you need to be mindful of your image.”

“Hmph. I don’t dare. I like Senior Brother the best!” Wang Yuruo chuckled. She might be mindful if there was someone else around, but Ye Ziling was the only one here so she had no other concerns. After all, She was fond of Lin Yun, and it was mainly pure admiration and respect rather than love.

“She has been urging me to come,” smiled Ye Ziling.

“I didn’t! Kitty!” Wang Yuruo’s face turned red upon seeing Lil’ Red. She quickly ran over to Lil’ Red, leaving Lin Yun and Ye Ziling. Anyone could tell that she hoped that Lin Yun and Ye Ziling would come together, and she had always been creating chances for them.

Then again, Lin Yun and Ye Ziling both knew what she was trying to do. But neither of them cared. “Looks like you’ve grown in terms of your temperament after reaching the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm. You give off a feeling as if you’re a god, but it’s still easy for others to be friendly towards you.”

Is she praising my handsomeness? Lin Yun smiled because Ye Ziling was still the same as always. Even when she praised someone, her praises sounded awkward.

“I won’t believe those words if someone else was praising me, but I believe you.” Lin Yun then led Ye Ziling into his residence.

Ye Ziling came in, but she looked disappointed, “Where’s Lil’ Purple? I have been wanting to find an opportunity to apologize to her.”

“Haha, no worries. I’ll let her know of your arrival next time. If she knows that you’re coming, she’ll definitely be joyful.” Lin Yun laughed while Lil’ Purple who was hiding in the sword box immediately trembled in fear.

“Actually, I need your help,” said Ye Ziling.

When Lin Yun heard that, the smile on his face disappeared. Ye Ziling was like him in terms of personality as she wouldn’t ask someone for help if she could resolve it. Since Ye Ziling was willing to ask him for help, it must be important. He asked, “Senior Sister, tell me.”

“I wish for you to participate in the ranking battle on behalf of the sect,” said Ye Ziling after she mustered her courage.

“To be honest, I shouldn’t trouble you since you already taught me the last three swords of the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords. But it’s troublesome this time. Not only are the four major sects participating, but several demonic cults are also participating,” said Ye Ziling with a grave expression. “This is no longer about making it into the top four but about becoming the champion. The champion can draw out their territory as they wish in the Profound Azure Prefecture.”

Lin Yun’s face changed when he heard that. He was surprised by the sudden change of the rules. Not only could the demonic forces join in, but the champion was actually granted such a huge authority. It looks like the Profound Azure Prefecture was determined to reshuffle the cards.

“I have no issue with it. I’ll naturally do my best since you asked for my help,” said Lin Yun without any hesitation.

Ye Ziling rejoiced when she heard that. Although Lin Yun was still in the Heavenly Soul Realm, he was someone who had reached the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm. This meant that he could make a breakthrough into the Empyrean Realm if he wanted, and his strength would boost greatly if he made his breakthrough. With Lin Yun’s help and her comprehension over this period of time, there was a high chance that they could become the champion of the ranking battle.

“Thank you,” said Ye Ziling with a solemn expression. “You can come and look for me in the future if you need my help. I’ll also come no matter where you are!”

“Haha, you’re taking it too seriously,” smiled Lin Yun. He was also a disciple of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, and it was natural for him to help the sect. Furthermore, Lin Yun knew of Ye Ziling's obsession with the ranking battle.

Based on her talent and bloodline, she should have been able to head to the Ancient Barren Domain a long time ago. So staying in the Profound Azure Prefecture was a pure waste of her time. Even Lin Yun didn’t dare to say that he could do what she did, which was why he admired her.

“Honestly speaking, you can try talking to Lady Luo,” suggested Lin Yun. He could tell that Luo Hua was strong, and there was a high chance that they could obtain the championship if Luo Hua helped.

“She isn’t willing. Furthermore, I don’t like her,” said Ye Ziling without a bat of her eye.

This made Lin Yun smile, “So you like me?”

“Of course.” Ye Ziling admitted that made Lin Yun feel uncomfortable. Seeing the weird expression on Lin Yun’s face, Ye Ziling’s eyes flashed with a cunning light, and smiled, “But not that kind of like.”

Hearing that, Lin Yun was briefly stunned before he smiled, “Yeah. It’s similar to how I like Senior Sister Ye .”

“Alright, let’s cut it out now.” Ye Ziling stood up. “I take this as your promise. We’ll head to the Profound Azure Prefecture half a month from now. Remember what you promised me.”

“Of course,” said Lin Yun. He wasn’t someone who would go against his promise once he gave one. This was why he was similar to Ye Ziling. If he didn’t promise her, they could still be friends. But since he had already promised her, he naturally had to give it his all.

The two of them chatted briefly before Lin Yun sent Ye Ziling and Wang Yuruo out. When the two left, Wang Yuruo asked, “Senior Sister, what’s wrong?”

“He gave his promise,” said Ye Ziling. “I roughly understand his personality, and he’ll definitely agree to it since I asked. But I didn’t expect that he would agree to it so easily. Looks like I’ve misunderstood him deeply in the past.”

“Hmph. Of course you did! After all, I can tell from the first glance that Senior Brother Lin is a good person,” smiled Wang Yuruo.

“But I owe him too much, and I have no idea when I can repay him,” sighed Ye Ziling.

“Why don’t you two get together?” Wang Yuruo smiled. “There’s no need to repay him if the two of you get together.”

“You must be itching for a beating!” Ye Ziling glared at Wang Yuruo.

“I heard your conversation, you both said you like each other,” smiled Wang Yuruo.

“Not all likes are the same. If you dare to cause any trouble again, I’ll betroth you to him!” Ye Zilign said.

“No way. Yuruo is still small…” Wang Yuruo immediately lowered her red face.

After Ye Ziling left, Lil’ Purple came out of the sword box and said, “Well. At least she isn’t as bad as I thought.”

“She’s not bad. She’s only afraid that you might be captured by bad people because of your looks,” smiled Lin Yun.

Hearing that, Lil’ Purple was happy and smiled, “Of course I have good looks. No one can be compared to me. But did you really have to make that promise? What if you can’t make it in time? Don’t forget that you also gave your promise to that old geezer.”

“It might be an issue, but it seems like a coincidence…” Lin Yun pondered before he continued, “He’s also the sect master of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, so he should be able to understand me.”

“Don’t be so certain,” said Lil’ Purple. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Lin Yun changed the topic and took out a Profound Wither Key from the interspatial pouch, “Do you know what key is this?”

“What is this?” Lil’ Purple examined the key before she muttered, “Interesting. There’s actually the aura of hell on it…”

“This is related to the nine emperors,” said Lin Yun as he went on to explain the relationship the Profound Wither Saint had with the Southern Emperor.

Lil’ Purple took the key before she said in disdain, “I have no relationship with the so-called nine emperors. How dare they take on the title of emperor?!”

Lin Yun’s lips twitched when he heard that. When he recalled the mysterious island in the Profound Wither Sea, Lin Yun had a feeling that the island was related to this key. “It’s fine, I’ll look into it myself.”

Seeing that Lin Yun took out his flute, Lil’ Purple instantly knew who Lin Yun was going to meet. With a snort she muttered, “Hmph. What a scumbag.”

Lin Yun soared into the sky and headed towards the direction of the Sword Saint Mountain while he played the flute. It didn’t take long for zither music to sound out, which made Lin Yun smile. This was his relationship with Luo Hua. Whenever they both played their instruments, it meant they were free to meet.
