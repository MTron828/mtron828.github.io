Chapter 2313 - Perhaps I Really Know Him

Lin Yun’s words caused the holy master to fall into silence. A brief moment later, the holy master said, “I’ll be honest with you. Some people went there before, but no one managed to return.”

Lin Yun suddenly thought of something, and his face changed, “Ji Zixi?”

The holy master helplessly nodded, verifying Lin Yun’s guess, “It’s the same for her. It will be dangerous for her, and with the odds as they are, she might not be able to return.”

Lin Yun felt terrible but asked, “Is there a need for a little girl to take such a huge risk just for the dream of becoming a deity?”

The holy master was stunned and looked at Lin Yun, his heart aching, unable to speak. The Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign sighed, “There’s something you don’t know.”

“Mhm?” Lin Yun was curious.

The Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign looked at the holy master. Seeing that the latter didn’t stop him, he explained, “The Divine Phoenix Mountain doesn’t belong to the Kunlun Realm but those with the phoenix bloodline who came admiring the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity. They sacrificed a lot in that battle for the Kunlun Realm and are willing to protect it for the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity.

“But that lord from Divine Phoenix Mountain committed a grave mistake and was sealed, taken away when the Heavenly Path was severed. Since then, Divine Phoenix Mountain has declined and could only stay in the Kunlun Realm. They have been waiting for that lord to appear and trying to reach the Deity Realm to save that lord. Aside from that, they also want to bring Divine Phoenix Mountain back home since they have been drifting outside for a hundred thousand years.

“Divine Phoenix Mountain worked hard for a hundred thousand years for this objective. The holy master would go to the Heavenly Barren Realm each time, and it’s the same this time. It is also their last chance.”

Lin Yun was briefly stunned because he didn’t expect that.

The holy master said, “I have already talked about this with Zixi, and she didn’t want you to be involved in this matter, not allowing me to tell you about it.”

Lin Yun was briefly stunned but wasn’t surprised because that was like Ji Zixi’s character.

“She invited you to the Divine Phoenix Mountain to welcome you here before leaving.” The holy master’s expression became serious, and he said, “I am selfish as a father and changed my mind after you came to the Divine Phoenix Mountain. I want you to accompany Ji Zixi since there’s now a high chance that she will survive. So I have been wondering how I can convince you.

“I know I have placed you in a tough spot, but I can give you my life if you agree!” The holy master sincerely said, looking at Lin Yun. He didn’t look like the Divine Phoenix Holy Master at this moment but a father.

Lin Yun said, “Holy Master, you don’t have to do this. I have also been thinking about what the Divine Phoenix Mountain needed when I came here to convince you guys.”

The holy master was stumped upon hearing that, while the Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign smiled, “It looks like you two shared the same thoughts.”

The holy master and Lin Yun exchanged a gaze, understanding each other after everything was said. One could give his life for his master, while the other could give his life for his daughter.

“So… you agree to it?” The holy master asked.

“Is there a reason for me to refuse?” Lin Yun smiled. He couldn’t find a reason to refuse, not to mention the holy master could fulfill his promise even if Lin Yun died in the Heavenly Barren Realm. Furthermore, the holy master was more useful to help his master’s tribulation than him.

Lin Yun might’ve grasped Nirvana Dao, but he didn’t think he could rival the holy master.

“Okay. I’ll make the Heavenly Dao Oath…” the holy master said.

“There’s no need. Since the holy master trusts me, I can also trust you. We’ll just do our best,” Lin Yun smiled, waving his hand. He already knew what kind of person the holy master was when they fought.

“Zixi doesn’t know of this yet, and she’s still tempering her physique now. It will be ready after three days,” the holy master said.

“Let me tell her about it,” Lin Yun said.

“It has been tough for you,” the holy master replied.

“It’s nothing. The Heavenly Barren Realm might be an opportunity for me. If I stayed in the Kunlun Realm, it would be hard for my strength to undergo a great transformation anytime soon, and there might be an opportunity for me in the Heavenly Barren Realm,” Lin Yun smiled. “Risks and opportunities come together, and you’re giving me the Sinful Fire Divine Rune.”Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The holy master and Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign exchanged a joyful gaze on their faces. Lin Yun might be young, but he was a person who thought about the bigger picture, not to mention that he didn’t have any air around him.

“They all say that Flower Burial is breathtaking, and I have experienced it today,” the holy master said.

Lin Yun smiled, “Holy Master, you’re too polite.”

“Alright. I will invite you to watch when Zixi’s divine physique has formed,” the holy master said.

“It’s my honor,” Lin Yun replied. With that, they agreed. But Lin Yun wasn’t in a hurry to leave and discussed the profundity of Nirvana Dao with the holy master. He asked, “Can Time Dao allow you to turn back time?”

“That’s impossible.” The holy master waved his hand to condense a Time Seal on a pot of flowers. The flower then began to grow. The flower bloomed and withered, repeating this cycle multiple times, and returned to normal after the Time Seal disappeared.

“Interesting…” Lin Yun’s eyes lit up.

The holy master explained, “Time Dao can speed up and slow down time, but it can’t allow you to go back in time. Strictly speaking, your Nirvana Dao isn’t going back in time but controlling time.”

“Oh? What do you mean by that?” Lin Yun asked.

“Controlling time through nirvana means that you can control time itself,” the holy master said. “It’s a transformation brought by combining time and space, but that doesn’t mean you went back in time.”

Lin Yun asked, “What if someone grasped both Time and Space Daos to achieve a similar effect?”

“That should be possible,” the holy master smiled. He explained, “If you divide an hour into four and that entire hour passes, what remains are seconds and microseconds. So time freezes in your eyes, and each microsecond will form a space for you. For example, four microseconds will be four spaces. Ordinary people can’t detect the changes, but you can since you’ve grasped Nirvana Dao, allowing you to break through the restriction of space-time and return to the previous space.

“The stronger your control in Nirvana Dao, the more space there will be. It doesn’t matter if you’re willing, but you will return to where you came from when that nirvana ends. When you become stronger, you can sense the fine changes in space-time and down to smaller units. But it will also become increasingly difficult and more risky. If someone can grasp both Time and Space Daos, they can achieve a similar effect. It’s just that it will be slightly different from yours.”

“I see…” Lin Yun muttered.

The Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign added, “Nirvana Dao is strong but not invincible. Aside from the risks the holy master spoke of, creating a nirvana space is impossible if your opponent is too strong.”

“I’m all ears,” Lin Yun said, frowning.

The Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign continued to explain, “For example, if you face an Emperor, the time and space around you will become tough, capable of affecting space-time without doing anything. Similarly, Time and Space Daos will also become ineffective before an Emperor and much harder to control than facing a Saint. This is only Time-Space Nirvana, recorded in some ancient records. But I don’t know about the others.”

Lin Yun received a huge harvest as he listened to their explanation.

When Lin Yun returned to the Stream Cloud Residence, he talked to Lil’ Purple about the Heavenly Barren Realm.

“You’re too impulsive in regards to the Heavenly Barren Realm,” Lil’ Purple said beneath the Phoenix Tree.

“You don’t agree?”

“Since when have I disagreed with your decision?”

Lin Yun looked at Lil’ Purple, who seemed calm.

“Furthermore, it might be an opportunity for you,” Lil’ Purple said. “Because the Heavenly Path is broken in the Kunlun Realm, it’s harder to cultivate saint dao here. But it’s different in the Heavenly Barren Realm. The only problem is if you can rush back for your master’s tribulation.”

Lin Yun nodded, “That’s also what I’m concerned about. But I decided to stay behind after weighing my options. My presence might not be able to help as much as the holy master. Then again, I will also try my best to return.”

“Actually…” Lil’ Purple said, “The broken Heavenly Path is a cage to many people. People inside cannot leave, while people outside cannot come in. Not many people will want to return when they can leave.”

“I can’t, at least not now. I would have tried to reforge the Heavenly Path even if the Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign didn’t ask,” Lin Yun smiled.

“Perhaps we might be able to find out more about the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity when we’re in the Heavenly Barren Realm. The ‘broken sword’ in your body and the Old Kunlun is a mystery, but it’s related to the Ancestral Deity,” Lil’ Purple said.

Lin Yun briefly pondered, then said, “I have a feeling that I might be even more deeply connected to the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity than I think. Xiao Chen… perhaps I know him.”
