Chapter 1441 - One-Star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm

“Big Sister, big news!” A figure hurriedly descended onto a palace suspended above the Saint Pool in the Scarlet Firmament Peak.

“Mhm?” Mu Xueqin opened her eyes and looked at Mu Qingqing, who hurriedly arrived. This made her unhappily furrow her brows, and she asked, “What’s wrong? Calm down first.”

Mu Qingqing’s face was red from the blood flow as she rushed over and held onto Mu Xueqin’s hand. She stuck her tongue out and smiled, “How can you still stay in seclusion when something so big is happening? You probably wouldn't know if I hadn’t told you!”

Although Mu Xueqin briefly struggled, she still allowed herself to be pulled up and the two soared into the sky. The Saint Pool Square beneath them was empty without a single person. There weren’t any disciples around. Even the elders who would usually guide disciples there and deacons responsible for guarding this place were gone. Mu Xueqin’s face changed as she asked, “Where is everybody? Did the Profound Sky Sect come and attack us?”

Hearing what Mu Xueqin said, Mu Qingqing chuckled as she covered her mouth, “Big Sister, you’re hilarious. It’s not the Profound Sky Sect, but the person you told me to pay attention to!”

“Flower Burial Lin Yun? What’s wrong? Didn’t he just join the Divine Firmament Peak? Even if there’s a dispute over him becoming a direct disciple, it’s just a fight. Is there a need for everyone on the Scarlet Firmament Peak to go watch?” Mu Xueqin said.

Along the way, there wasn't a single person left except within some significant buildings such as the Elixir Pavilion, Martial Arts Hall, and the Heavenly Sword Pagoda. This scene made Mu Xueqin furious, and she commented, “What the hell are these people doing? How dare they leave their posts without permission. I have to tell Father about this later. The defense and discipline are too loose. What if an enemy launches an attack on us?”

“Hehe, don’t worry about that. Our father is already there. He’s the most unreliable person!” Mu Qingqing smiled when she saw Mu Xueqin’s expression.

When Mu Xueqin heard what Mu Qingqing said, her face changed with a flicker through her pupils. She asked, “What’s going on? Quickly tell me about it.”

“Lin Yun has stayed in the Divine Firmament Peak’s Saint Pool for twenty-nine days. This news has shocked the entire Sword Sect. The peak masters of the various peaks are already there, and even our father is alarmed by it.” Mu Qingqing said with admiration in her pupils.

How is this possible?! Mu Xueqin’s face froze because that was too unbelievable. She couldn’t believe that someone could stay at the bottom of the Saint Pool for so long. It was known that there was a vortex at the bottom of the Saint Pool that could tear someone apart.

The only exception was Lin Yun’s physique, which was comparable to a Dragon Pulse Realm expert. After reaching the Dragon Pulse Realm, the forming of each pulse would slowly shred the mortal body towards the Saint Path.

“But that’s the truth. Even our father is there. Big Sister, do you not believe me?” Mu Qingqing was unhappy.

“It’s common sense that I don’t trust you. Anyhow, we’ll know after taking a look.” Mu Xueqin smiled.

“Big Sister, how long did you last in the Saint Pool?” Mu Qingqing smiled as she rolled her eyes.

Mu Xueqin glared at Mu Qingqing, then ignored her. She only lasted nine days, and it was already an impressive achievement. She was only second to Gu Ruochen, who was first on the Heaven Ranking. But that wasn’t the reason she doubted what Mu Qingqing said. The main reason was that even Jian Jingtian only managed to stay eighteen days in the Saint Pool.

Back to the Divine Firmament Peak, Saint Pool Square was filled with people. But even so, there were still more people coming. But every last one of them had shock in their pupils as they looked in the direction of the Saint Pool.

“So many people…” Mu Xueqin’s face changed when she realized it was difficult to get any closer. When she raised her head, she instantly saw Mu Xuankong. Her father was standing with the other peak masters except for Mu Chuan, who wore an unnatural expression; his cheeks trembled as he forced a smile to try and look relatively relaxed. But anyone could tell with a glance that he was nervous.

“Let’s just stand here.” Mu Xueqin pulled Mu Qingqing to the side, since they were too special. If they went in, it would definitely cause a sensation, and Mu Xueqin didn’t like the feeling of being observed like an animal in a zoo. But this made Mu Qingqing unhappy because she still wanted to get closer to the Saint Pool.

“That Lin Yun is really similar to Jian Jingtian from back then…”

“He came from the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect and has a deep relationship with Jian Jingtian.”

“If we’re looking at the results of the Saint Pool alone, Lin Yun has already surpassed Jian Jingtian. Is the Sword Sect going to have another first ranker of the three rankings?” Many elders had a deep impression of Jian Jingtian.

Jian Jingtian was a legend in the Sword Sect who shone brightly, and many people didn’t doubt that he could become a saint. It was so much so that many people thought he could surpass his master, the Radiant Sword Saint, and bring the Sword Sect to become a holy land.

He once brought tears to countless people in the Sword Sect, but he disappeared after what happened eighteen years ago. He couldn’t even leave the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect now.

But now, another genius appeared from the Divine Firmament Peak, who was also the disciple of the Radiant Sword Saint. So how could the elders not be excited? Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

As time passed, the night flew by, and dawn arrived. This excited everyone because Lin Yun had stayed in the Saint Pool for thirty days. This was a miracle, an achievement that no one might be able to break for hundreds of years to come.

When dawn shone on the Divine Firmament Peak, the surface of the Saint Pool began to tremble with waves splashing and dazzling light soaring to the sky. This immediately attracted Mu Chuan’s attention as he stretched his neck to look at the Saint Pool below.

“Are those sword rays?”

“Looks like Lin Yun is coming out!” Everyone became excited as they involuntarily stretched their necks. Lin Yun was finally coming out after thirty days in the Saint Pool.

Just when everyone was looking forward to it, the surface of the Saint Pool exploded with golden lights bursting out, accompanied by a terrifying aura.

“That aura seems to be at the Heavenly Elysium Core Realm…” Several peak masters said in an uncertain tone. The corner of Mu Chuan’s lips twitched when he heard that. Lin Yun has broken through to the Heavenly Elysium Core Realm? Just how much astral saint dust did he refine?

He remembered that Lin Yun was only in the Greater Elysium Core Realm before he entered the Saint Pool.

Before everyone could react, a golden light streaked across the horizon and appeared before everyone. When the golden light dissipated, everyone squinted their eyes and was surprised. The golden light was naturally Lin Yun. He was enveloped in golden light as sunlight shone on him, which gave him an ethereal temperament.

Everyone was shocked as they looked at Lin Yun because he had reached the Heavenly Elysium Core Realm. But that wasn’t all, he even formed his first star. This meant that Lin Yun was now at the one-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm.

Before entering the Saint Pool, he had just reached the Greater Elysium Core Realm. But he had now reached the one-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm.

“Isn’t this a little too unbelievable…?” Mu Qingqing was stumped as she covered her mouth.

Mu Xueqin’s eyes were also flickering as she muttered, “Sword Sect… is going to have another Jian Jingtian!”
