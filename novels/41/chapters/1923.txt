Chapter 1924 - Fury!

The moon hung high in the sky at night as Lin Yun came to the Celestial Purging Mountain by himself. The Celestial Purging Mountain would be opened once a month, and it still wasn’t time for it to open.

There was a barrier guarding the mountain, and the surroundings were empty.

“How empty,” Lin Yun sighed, looking around. He couldn’t even see a single person in the surroundings. This was what Lin Yun wanted. Since he planned to give the trial an attempt, he naturally wanted to do it in a low profile, without anyone knowing.

“Stop.” A blue-robed old man appeared just when Lin Yun wanted to touch the barrier, and this old man was a Quasi-Saint.

“Greetings, Senior. I am Ye Qingtian, the direct disciple of the Dragon Origin Great Saint.” Lin Yun calmly handed the medal over.

The blue-robed old man used the moonlight to take a clear look at medal’s surface and smiled, “Didn’t you just reach the fourth level not long ago? You’ve come again to give it a try?”

“Yeah. I should have that qualification as a Great Saint’s direct disciple, right?” Lin Yun asked.

“That’s for sure. As a Great Saint’s direct disciple, you can come here anytime. But it’s simply a waste of time since you came here seven days ago, and it’ll be a pity if you’re injured,” the blue-robed old man persuaded, returning the medal to him.

“It doesn’t matter. I’ll have to trouble Senior to open the barrier,” Lin Yun said.

“Do you want to start from the beginning again or from the previous trial?” The blue-robed old man asked.

“Just send me directly to the fourth level’s third trial,” Lin Yun said. If he had started from the beginning, he would only be able to obtain more low-level Heavenly Cloud Fruits, which would have been a waste of time for Lin Yun. So he could continue from where he stopped and see if he could grasp the Astral Sword Intent.

“You’re really not afraid of death. If you’re injured, you won’t be able to participate in the Ranking Battle three days from now,” the blue-robed old man said, before he opened the barrier for Lin Yun. When he waved his hand, a Celestial Crane flew down.

“Your name is already on this jade, and it’ll immediately bring you over. Immediately come down if you fail, and don’t force yourself,” the old man warned out of goodwill.

Lin Yun nodded his head and sat on the Celestial Crane. When he looked at the ancient monument, his name was on the fourth grid, and his name would be on the fifth grid if he made it to the fifth level. At that time, he wouldn’t be able to maintain a low profile, even if he wanted to. But that would be a month from now, so he didn’t have to think about that now.

As moonlight shone down, the sea of clouds looked like a celestial realm. This piqued Lin Yun’s interest, and he took out the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute and played the Phoenix Heart Song. His music was ethereal, and each musical note was intoxicating.

“You played an ancient song of the Phoenix Clan, right? It’s beautiful,” the Celestial Crane said after sending Lin Yun to the fourth level, praising Lin Yun’s music.

Lin Yun was first alarmed before he smiled, “I’m impressed that a Celestial Crane actually knows music.”

The Celestial Crane turned around and transformed into an exquisite girl. This was a spiritual-looking little girl, who said, “Hmph, who are you looking down on? My master plays better than you.”

Lin Yun smiled upon hearing that, but he suddenly thought of something. He had long noticed that the nine levels on the Celestial Purging Mountain were a massive spiritual array that were interconnected, and there must be someone controlling it, or the spiritual array wouldn’t be able to operate for so many years.

The Celestial Purging Mountain existed for a long time, and Lin Yun had already obtained a Heart of the Sword Saint here, so he had already felt respect for this place. He felt that this mountain wasn’t simple and had a huge secret here.

“May I ask about your name?” Lin Yun asked curiously. “Have all the Celestial Cranes unlocked their intelligence and taken on human form?”

“My name is Crane Fairy, and my master calls me He’er. The other Celestial Cranes are ordinary spiritual beasts, but I’ve obtained the opportunity to take on a human form because I stayed beside my master for a long time. I’m normally responsible for receiving Great Saint’s direct disciples,” the little girl smiled

Hearing what the little girl said, Lin Yun smiled, “Where does your master stay? Can you bring me to him? I’ll give you something good to eat.”

As Lin Yun spoke, he took out all the remaining Heavenly Cloud Fruits and gave them to the little girl.

The little girl’s eyes lit up, and she smiled after swallowing a Heavenly Cloud Fruit, “It’s fine to tell you. My master is on the ninth level, but you have to go up yourself. I can’t bring you there. I have been eating these fruits since I was young, and the fruits in my master’s home are much sweeter.”

When Lin Yun looked at the little girl again, he noticed a powerful sword intent within her body that even he felt fearful of. He was inwardly alarmed because it must be the Astral Sword Intent, since his sword intent felt pressured. He exclaimed, “Astral Sword Intent!”

More accurately, it had reached the minimum of the Astral Sword Intent, and this greatly shocked him. A bird that lives on the ninth level of the Celestial Purging Mountain was stronger than him?

“You’re not allowed to probe me. Oh, shit. My master told me not to speak to others. This is all your fault! Why do you have to look so handsome?” The little girl looked at Lin Yun with disdain before transforming back into a Celestial Crane and flying off.

Lin Yun was disappointed that he couldn’t get any more information from her, but he restrained the thought of catching her. If he could catch her, he could immediately reach the ninth level, right? But that wasn’t something he would do.

What the Dragon Origin Great Saint said was right, the Celestial Purging Mountain was a land of treasure, and there must be secrets here. Lin Yun cleared his mind and looked up ahead. He was increasingly more confident about grasping the Astral Sword Intent now.

He came before the sea of clouds and looked at the palace at the far end of the clouds, which was a few thousand miles away. Both Bai Shuying and Wang Muyan failed in this trial. Lin Yun held the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute and gently patted it against his left hand.

“It should work…” After making up his mind, Lin Yun took out the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute and started playing it.

The Nine Lotus Diagram flew out from his chest and slowly opened up under the flute music. Lin Yun soared to the sky and stood on the painting before manipulating it with his music to carry him forth.

The Nine Lotus Diagram was created with divine runes, and Lin Yun still couldn’t control it with his mental energy. He could only use it as a trump card in times of danger by trapping his opponent in it before using the nine lotuses to devour them.

But he could use a small trick by controlling the painting with his music, and he would be able to barely control it. With the Nine Lotus Diagram protecting him, he could immediately fly towards the palace.

It didn’t take long for spiritual puppets to charge at Lin Yun. Those spiritual puppets weren’t strong alone, since they were only at the Nirvana Stage. But they had the advantage in numbers, and they also had a tough physique.

It was different this time because the Nine Lotus Diagram shone brightly when they reached the painting. As nine-colored lotuses bloomed, the petals flew out and crushed those spiritual puppets before they could even get close.

Nine different colored divine runes also coiled around Lin Yun, with petals enveloping him. Lin Yun stood on the painting and flew towards the palace like an immortal. Simultaneously, light shone on his forehead, and he used his Heavenly Dome Sword Intent to resist the sword aura coming from the palace.

It didn’t take long for Lin Yun to travel one-tenth of the journey, and it really worked just as he had expected. This brought a smile to Lin Yun’s face, and he thought of this method when Lil’ Purple told him about music dao. He felt that this might work, and this was why he wanted to give it a try. He never expected that it would be so smooth, either.

Strictly speaking, it couldn’t be considered cheating because Wang Muyan and Bai Shuying also used an external object when attempting this trial. But this trial wasn’t something that he could pass because of the sword aura being emitted from the palace. Even if Lin Yun used the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella, it was futile, so he relied on the Nine Lotus Diagram.

Four hours later, Lin Yun finally made it to the palace and reached his limit. He exhausted almost all of his mental energy and was on the brink of collapsing.

“I made it!” Lin Yun stomped his foot on the painting and flew toward the palace. But just when he was about to land on the ground, a hand flew over, accompanied by tens of thousands of sword rays.

“You want to make it through this trial with such a cheating method? Get lost!” A roar came from the palace, sounding unhappy with how Lin Yun made it through the trial.

“Are you done?!” Lin Yun instantly became furious and coldly said, “You’re a mere gatekeeper. Who the hell do you think you are to tell me to get lost?”

Lin Yun didn’t want to waste time with the gatekeeper and retrieved the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella, activating his two saint physiques simultaneously. As he poured his vitality into the umbrella, the umbrella shone brightly, and he thrust it forth.

The palm was instantly destroyed along with the sword rays while Lin Yun firmly landed on the ground. Before the closed palace, the white-clothed man looked at Lin Yun with shock, “A Sovereign Saint Artifact…”

Lin Yun squinted his eyes and examined this white-clothed man. This gatekeeper’s cultivation seemed to be restrained at the limit of the Nirvana Stage, and he instantly noticed that this man was an artifact spirit. He stepped forth and coldly asked, “You seem unhappy with how I made it through this trial?”

“The Celestial Purging Mountain tests martial intent, so how can I possibly allow anyone to pass as the gatekeeper?” The white-clothed man said, despite feeling afraid of the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella.

“What a joke! Without the Nine Lotus Diagram, do you think I can make it through with my Heavenly Dome Sword Intent alone?” Lin Yun barked.

When the white-clothed gatekeeper raised his head, he noticed Lin Yun’s sword intent was unfathomable, and his Heavenly Dome Sword Intent had reached complete mastery. Not only that, but the aura his Heavenly Dome Sword Intent gave off was even more terrifying than some Quasi-Astral Sword Intent. Most importantly, Lin Yun’s sword intent felt like a deep abyssal ocean.

“This… How is this possible? Your sword intent is only at the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent!” The white-clothed gatekeeper exclaimed.

“Cut the nonsense. Are you going to let me pass or not!” Lin Yun asked coldly.

The white-clothed gatekeeper already cowered, but he still stood his ground and replied, “You relied on an external object.”

Lin Yun coldly looked at the white-clothed gatekeeper, and his gaze made the latter feel afraid.

“You’re saying that others didn’t use any external objects?”

“They only used one, and it’s usually their weapon. I won’t say anything if you use your sword, but you used three…” The white-clothed gatekeeper continued to argue.

“Cut the crap. I can’t make it through with my talent in sword dao?” Lin Yun roared.

“Then you can try again. If your cultivation reaches the Nirvana Stage, you can make it through this trial with your sword intent,” the white-clothed gatekeeper said.

What the gatekeeper said enraged Lin Yun, and he barked, “What a joke. No one can stop me today, and how dare you, as a mere artifact spirit. You’re courting death!”

Lin Yun opened the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella, simultaneously activating the glorysun and glorymoon spirits. The white-clothed gatekeeper immediately fell to the ground when the umbrella was opened. But Lin Yun didn’t stop there and reached out to the gatekeeper. He roared, “Come here!”

When Lin Yun grabbed the gatekeeper’s neck, the gatekeeper was immediately afraid as he said, “L-Let me go… I’ll let you pass.”

But it was already too late for the gatekeeper. Lin Yun quickly snapped the gatekeeper’s neck, and a light descended as the door opened, making Lin Yun feel warm. When he raised his head, he saw a sword hovering in the sky, and the sword aura that was being released from the palace came from this sword.

Many four-colored Heavenly Cloud Fruits were coiling around the sword, embellishing the sword like stars.

Lin Yun had already come this far, and he wasn’t polite. As the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella flew up, the Black Tortoise Chains flew out and retrieved over two hundred four-colored Heavenly Cloud Fruits. After he was done, he summoned a Celestial Crane and headed to the fifth level.Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com
