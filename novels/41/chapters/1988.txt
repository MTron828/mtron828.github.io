Chapter 1989 - I Also Have A Friend

“I have this friend; he used to have a senior… a junior sister. Since he had just arrived in the sect, that junior sister took great care of him. They experienced a lot together, and they supported each other.” Lin Yun sat with his legs crossed, paying attention to Xin Yan’s expression. He continued, “Their relationship has long surpassed that of martial siblings, but my friend was too young back then. He didn’t know the feelings of that junior sister and only treated her as a young sister. He was only focused on finding the person he loves…”

Xin Yan listened to the story and suddenly smiled, “That junior sister must be really pretty.”

“Yeah. She’s as pretty as Senior Sister,” Lin Yun couldn’t help saying that , looking at Xin Yan in a daze.

Xin Yan blinked her eyes and felt that Ye Qingtian finally revealed his fox’s tail. In a teasing tone, she smiled, “Ye Qingtian, is that what you said to Bai Shuying as well?”

Xin Yan was smiling, but this made Lin Yun’s heart ache. He had a lot of bitterness in his heart, but he didn’t know how to express it. It felt as though there was an invisible hand clenching his heart. He squeezed out a smile as a form of response and continued, “They both experienced a lot after that, and they even shared the pain of losing someone who was a friend and a family to them. When all the hardships before them were cleared, my friend finally found clues about his lover. He asked his junior sister about it, and his junior sister encouraged him with a smile, telling him not to miss this opportunity. When everything was over, he discovered that the junior sister had left when he turned around. It has been many years since then, and my friend is in much pain because he realized how wrong he was.”

Xin Yan sighed, “The moonlight in the heart… The junior sister is still inferior to the moonlight.”Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The moonlight in the hearts of every man was their weakness, just like the moonlight shining through the window. It couldn’t be reached or touched, but people always yearn for it. Every man had two girls in their hearts. The goddess in their hearts when they were young, like the moonlight in their hearts. The other was a woman who lived by his side. She could be a lover, a wife, or a real person in front of him.

Lin Yun didn’t know if Su Ziyao could be considered his moonlight, but he knew that Xin Yan was also an important person in his life. If Su Ziyao was the moonlight in his life, Xin Yan was the woman in front of him. People might call him greedy, but he really wanted all of them. They were people he was willing to put his life at risk for to protect them, and they were also his weakness.

Xin Yan smiled, “Ye Qingtian, is the ‘friend’ you’re talking about you?”

“Senior Sister, would you forgive my friend if it’s you?” Lin Yun asked. He didn’t reply to Xin Yan’s question.

Xin Yan was briefly stunned before she said, “And you’re still not admitting that you were referring to yourself when you mentioned this ‘friend.’”

“Senior Sister, would you forgive my friend if it’s you?” Lin Yun repeated his question.

Xin Yan was still wearing a smile, and she said, “Ye Qingtian, I never realized that you’re pretty adorable. It looks like the rumors are true.”

“What rumors?”

“There were rumors that Bai Shuying was forced to leave by you, and there were also rumors that you took her virginity a year ago,” Xin Yan said. “I didn’t believe it at first, but I’m starting to believe it now. That junior sister should be from the Ye Clan, right? As for the moonlight, it’s naturally Bai Shuying. As expected of you, Ye Qingtian. Even I was mistaken.”

Lin Yun opened his mouth and was speechless, but he couldn’t help expressing a grievance.

This made Xin Yan laugh, and she said, “Alright, I won’t tease you anymore, and I’ll answer you seriously. Since you can ask that question, it means you’ve yet to grow up, and you don’t understand your junior sister.”

“What do you mean?” Lin Yun asked.

“If my guess is right, your junior sister has never blamed you for it. She can even give up the opportunity to wander the world with you, so how could she blame you? She just hopes everything is good for you…” Xin Yan said. When she said that, her expression darkened as though she thought of something. She smiled bitterly, “I also have a friend, and her junior brother is as good-looking as you. No, he’s even more good-looking than you.”

Lin Yun’s heart fluctuated like a pebble thrown into a lake, and he had difficulty holding himself down. He bit on his lips and raised his head, “Senior Sister, I’m also your junior brother.”

Xin Yan was stunned when she laughed, “Ye Qingtian, it’s not good to take advantage of someone else. I only have one junior brother in my life. He came facing the wind and became enemies with the entire world for me…”

After she was done speaking, she left, but her voice still resounded, “Since ancient times, being lovesick has always been the harshest.”

Xin Yan gradually disappeared into the distance until she could no longer be seen. Lin Yun stood up and was filled with mixed feelings while watching Xin Yan’s leaving figure. A long time later, he took a deep breath and smiled, “It looks like I’ve been misunderstood.”

Three days later, Lin Yun’s hands began to change on the massive Buddha statue, performing the Blue Dragon Seal, Golden Dragon Seal, Silver Dragon Seal, and White Dragon Seal…

As a boundless nirvana aura was poured into his ten fingers, seven dragon seals were formed before they began to fuse. Ultimately, a seven-colored radiance shone from his hands, forming layers of light curtains behind him. Lin Yun had executed the perfect Sovereign Dragon Seal with an ancient aura being emitted from it. At the same time, a terrifying dragon aura also enveloped the entire region.

The mist covering the plaza was swept away, and Lin Yun’s aura swept out into the surroundings. He sighed because the terrifying power of the Sovereign Dragon Seal even made him fearful. “This is the power of the complete Sovereign Dragon Seal?”

He now understood why his master told him not to rush with the Sovereign Dragon Seal. No matter how he trained in it, it would be incomplete without the perfect Sovereign Dragon Seal. With a single thought, he dispersed the Sovereign Dragon Seal.

Bai Shuying and Xin Yan had left, and the Heavenly Dao Sect suddenly felt empty to him. He muttered, “It’s time for me to get going as well.”

Lin Yun went to meet the Serene Dust Great Saint and told her about his intention, to which the latter nodded in agreement. He wanted to go to the Myriad Graves Valley. Since those at the Quasi-Saint Realm couldn't, the dangers were relatively low for Lin Yun.

But the moment he came out of the Profound Maiden Courtyard, he ran into a woman that shared an uncanny resemblance with Bai Shuying.

Lin Yun instantly realized that this must be the saint disciple Wang Yue spoke of, the younger sister of Bai Shuying, Bai Qingyu. She seemed to be waiting outside the Profound Maiden Courtyard for a long time, and she roared when she saw Lin Yun, “Ye Qingtian, it’s either you die, or I die today!”

Lin Yun stopped and looked at Bai Qingyu, “It’s prohibited to take another disciple’s life, not to mention I’m the secluded disciple of the Dragon Origin Great Saint. So you should address me as ‘Senior Brother’.”

Bai Qingyu executed a profound movement technique and dashed forth. When she landed on the ground, she coldly said, “You think you deserve to be called ‘Senior Brother’ by me? Someone like you should pay for taking my sister’s innocence with your death!”

Lin Yun didn’t want to waste any time with her. She was no different from a child in his eyes; anyone could tell she was spoiled. But she was Bai Shuying’s younger sister, and Lin Yun couldn’t teach her a lesson like he taught others.

“Ye Qingtian, you’ve finally come out! You must be guilty since you’ve been hiding in the Profound Maiden Courtyard!” Four figures walked out, and Lin Yun was familiar with them. They were Xiao Jingyan, Bai Yizhou, Zhang Kui, and Ye Qinghong. After some time of not seeing each other, they reached the eighth transformation of the Nirvana Stage.

Everyone has gotten stronger, and Xiao Jingyan was the most unpredictable amongst the four. As a saint’s disciple of the Heavenly Yin Palace, he was mysterious and gave off a powerful aura. He was also the one who spoke out.

“Ye Qinghong, I thought you’d be in bed for at least half a year,” Lin Yun said.

After what he experienced in the plaza before the Dustless Plaza, Ye Qinghong became more scheming, and he wasn’t furious by what Ye Qingtian said. Instead, he smiled, “Not bad. It can be considered a blessing in disguise, and I have to thank you for that.”

“Ye Qingtian, the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden, left the sect after speaking with you. You dare say that it has nothing to do with you?” Bai Yizhou coldly questioned.

“Ye Qingtian, I’ll give you a chance. I won’t pursue this matter if you can defeat me. If you lose, you must sever your arms and never appear within Heavenly Dao Sect again!” Bai Qingyu said.

Seeing such a tyrannical brat, Lin Yun said, “Sure. Come on, then.”

This brat probably doesn’t know about the dangers that are in the world, and there was a high probability that she had been indoctrinated with improper thoughts or even instigated by others. To put it bluntly, she had no brains. If Lin Yun disagreed, she might fight him on the spot, disregarding the sect’s rules.

“Let’s agree in advance that we won’t use our constellations,” Lin Yun said.

“Okay.” Bai Qingyu rejoiced and circulated her nirvana aura with her saint sword shining brightly. Those from the Heavenly Dao Sect would be able to recognize this sword. This was the Stalewater Sword, a Twospirit Glory Saint Artifact. The sword’s body looked like rippling water.

“A Twospirit Glory Saint Artifact?” Lin Yun never looked down on her right from the beginning, but he was surprised her weapon was a Twospirit Glory Saint Artifact.

“You only said that we’re not allowed to use our constellations, and you said nothing about Glory Saint Artifacts. You can die now!” Bai Qingyu smiled, and she released her cultivation without any reservation. Her cultivation was at the ninth transformation of the Nirvana Stage.

This made Lin Yun frown, and he now knew why the Serene Dust Great Saint said his current cultivation was weak. He drew out the Flower Burial Sword, and a dazzling radiance enveloped the sword as it flew around him.

“Sword Manipulation, not bad!” Bai Qingyu activated a glory spirit, and waves began to appear with the sword as the center. She had fused with the surrounding ocean, and she could unleash a massive wave with a swing of her sword that made the surrounding space tremble.

“Stalewater Astral River!” Bai Qingyu soared to the sky and thrust her sword forth. She stood on a wave with a boundless ocean beneath her, and the power of this sword was terrifying. Lin Yun had to admit that Bai Qingyu was worthy of being Bai Shuying’s younger sister, since she wasn’t weak.

Lin Yun calmly flicked his finger, and the Flower Burial Sword disappeared. When the Flower Burial Sword reappeared, it was like a bright sun unleashing a horrifying sword aura, and Lin Yun easily destroyed the phenomenon of Bai Qingyu’s attack.

When Lin Yun flicked his finger again, the Flower Burial Sword turned around and shot forth. This made Bai Qingyu’s face change. She wanted to execute a secret technique to increase the power of her sword aura, but Lin Yun didn’t give her the opportunity. With a flick, the Flower Burial Sword’s attacks began to change.

Bai Qingyu had already lost when she made the wrong move, and the Stalewater Sword was knocked away from her hand.

A hint of greed flashed within Xiao Jingyan’s pupils when he saw this scene, while Ye Qinghong and others exclaimed in surprise, “That fellow is already at the fifth transformation of the Nirvana Stage?!”

“I can’t comprehend it. That fellow is a little too terrifying to reach the fifth transformation of the Nirvana Stage in such a short time.” Bai Yizhou shook his head.

“That’s not the key. Most importantly, he’s no weaker than Bai Qingyu despite his cultivation being at the fifth transformation of the Nirvana Stage. Bai Qingyu is Bai Shuying’s sister and possesses a saint physique. The resources she consumed ever since she was young were more than us. But Ye Qingtian can easily face her with his cultivation at the fifth transformation of the Nirvana Stage. If he’s at the ninth transformation of the Nirvana Stage, he might immediately enter the King Ranking!” Everyone was shocked, with fear flashing within the depths of their pupils. They could feel immense pressure coming from Ye Qingtian and knew they had to get rid of him.

“You’re despicable!” Bai Qingyu wasn’t convinced by her loss. “I haven’t even revealed half of my strength, and you launched a sneak attack against me!”

Lin Yun felt helpless when he heard that, and he could only comfort, “Go back and train if you want to fight me again.”

Bai Qingyu gritted her teeth, unable to accept her loss. She might not be comparable to her sister, but she was also a genius ever since she was young. She might lose occasionally, but she only lost to famous opponents, and Ye Qingtian wasn’t someone like that.

Lin Yun shook his head and ignored her. Strictly speaking, Bai Qingyu wasn’t weak but lacked actual combat experience. She didn’t even have murderous intent and couldn’t fully use her cultivation. Let’s not mention him, but even the likes of Ye Qinghong could easily defeat her. She was a delicate flower compared to her sister.

“Did we allow you to leave?” Ye Qinghong, Xiao Jingyan, Zhang Kui, and Bai Yizhou stepped forth.

Xiao Jingyan was the first to speak, “We couldn’t enjoy our battle to the fullest with Bai Shuying around. Now that you’re here, why don’t you give us some advice?”

“The four of you who are ranked in the top hundredth on the King Ranking want to join hands against someone at the fifth transformation of the Nirvana Stage?” A terrifying aura swept out, forcing Ye Qinghong, Xiao Jingyan, Zhang Kui, and Bai Yizhou to take a few steps back.
