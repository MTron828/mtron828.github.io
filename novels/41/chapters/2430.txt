Chapter 2431 - The Sinful Radiant Sword Saint

Mu Xuankong heaved in relief after hearing what the Divine Phoenix Holy Master said. The Divine Phoenix Holy Master’s seniority and strength were the strongest among them, and there was nothing Mu Xuankong could say if he wanted to become the commander. But he didn’t expect that the Divine Phoenix Holy Master would let him be the commander instead, which made Mu Xuankong respect him even more.

“Let’s not waste time, then,” Mu Xuankong said. “According to the information we received, we’re still inferior to them in regards to our numbers of Great Saints, so we’ll focus on defending.

Everyone nodded in acknowledgment upon hearing that. After all, it was evident that Tian Xuanzi would join hands with three holy lands and Black Mountain’s Seven Saints, not to mention that he must have had more preparations in the dark.

“The Sword Sect’s Great Profound Sword Canon has three levels. The entire sect is a layer, the hundred and eight peaks are the second layer, and the seven main peaks are the third layer, with the Scarlet Firmament Peak as the main peak. As long as the Scarlet Firmament Peak isn’t destroyed, we will have an endless flow of earth energy, and the saint veins won’t be destroyed. Since we also can’t allow Martial Ancestor Radiant to be disrupted, our final goal is to protect the Scarlet Firmament Peak.”

Any cultivator would have to extract spiritual energy for their tribulation, and one would require more spiritual energy for the Emperor's Tribulation. They didn’t have much of a choice about it, and it was fortunate that the Sword Sect used to be a holy land. Otherwise, they wouldn’t be able to support the Radiant Sword Saint in his tribulation.

Since they had to help the Radiant Sword Saint in his tribulation, they would have to protect the saint vein from destruction. Whether the Radiant Sword Saint could succeed, they could only leave it to fate. The odds of the Radiant Sword Saint succeeding in his tribulation were close to none, but that didn’t mean the Radiant Sword Saint had no chance.

But if the saint veins were destroyed or the Radiant Sword Saint was interrupted, he wouldn’t even have a wisp of a chance.

Mu Xuankong said, “So I have to trouble the holy master and Senior Azure Python to guard the Scarlet Firmament Peak. As for the other main peaks, we can arrange for two Great Saints to be stationed there,” Mu Xuankong said.

“But we don’t seem to have enough people. We still need another Great Saint,” the Azure Python Great Saint said. After all, they only had thirteen Great Saints in total.

“Hmph!” Lil’ Purple snorted as she sat on the hovering Iris Sword Box. She looked like a little girl, and she was naturally neglected.

The Divine Phoenix Holy Master said, “Lord Phoenix can withstand a Great Saint. So don’t worry about it.”

“Don’t forget my junior brother, Jian Jingtian. I heard that he had already left the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, with all the swords in the Profound Wither Sea snapped. So when he comes, he can also withstand a Great Saint,” Ye Guhan smiled.

Everyone was surprised since Jian Jingtian used to be first on the three rankings, and he would’ve soared in his cultivation if he hadn’t been imprisoned in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. In terms of his talent as a swordsman, even Flower Burial might not be able to suppress him.

“That’s great,” the Azure Python Great Saint smiled. He held back and didn’t say that the Azure Dragon’s lineage still had three Great Saints and their ancestor guarding outside. If something happened, they would protect Lin Yun and leave.

“If the other main peaks cannot be protected, everyone can retreat to the Scarlet Firmament Peak. As long as the Scarlet Firmament Peak still exists, the saint vein won’t be destroyed,” Mu Xuankong said. He continued, “Aside from Tian Xuanzi, there are three others we have to pay attention to. The Ming Cult’s Holy Master, the Black Mountain’s Heavenly Sever Great Saint, and the Netherport Sword Saint.”

“The Ming Cult can be considered the leader of the three holy lands, and he has reached complete mastery with the Sun-Moon Saint Canon. I heard that he even has a chance to become an Emperor,” the Divine Phoenix Holy Master said.

“I’ll deal with him,” the Azure Python Holy Master sneered. “I have fought him in the past. Only his ability to run is worth praising, and it’s troublesome for others to deal with him.”

“I’ll deal with the Netherport Sword Saint,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said. She was one of the Three Sword Saints, and she was the best candidate to deal with the Netherport Sword Saint.

The Dragon Origin Great Saint said, “I’ll deal with the Heavenly Sever Great Saint. Radiant and I have dealt with him in the past, and the Black Mountain’s Seven Saints are nothing.”

The Serene Dust Great Saint rolled her eyes when she heard that. It was thanks to the Radiant Sword Saint who mainly dealt with the Heavenly Sever Great Saint, not the Dragon Origin Great Saint.

The Divine Phoenix Holy Master smiled, “As for Tian Xuanzi, let me deal with him. I want to see how strong he is to claim to be the strongest beneath the Emperor Realm.”

Everyone was more confident now that they heard that. They didn’t rest and quickly moved according to Mu Xuankong’s arrangement. The Great Saints were stationed at the seven main peaks while the remaining Saint Sovereigns and Saint Lords scattered to the hundred and eight peaks. In the critical moment, they would all move to the Scarlet Firmament Peak.

At night, everyone was briefly resting for the upcoming battle. On the Golden Firmament Peak, the Serene Dust Great Saint and Heavenly Jade Sword Saint stood together, looking at the terrifying sword ray in the sky. Even at night, the crimson clouds gave off a fearsome crimson radiance, and they could tell that it was more terrifying than what they saw from the outside—standing here, even someone as strong as the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint felt tiny in comparison.

“Bai Ziyuan, do you think he can make it through?” The Serene Dust Great Saint asked uneasily. After all, not many people could make it through a tribulation of this level since the beginning of the Divine Dragon Era, and it wasn’t an exaggeration that it was close to hopeless for the Radiant Sword Saint to make it through this tribulation.

“We can only leave it to fate,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said. “We just have to protect him well.”

The Serene Dust Great Saint was furious, “Bai Ziyuan, do you have to be so cold when we’ve already come this far?”

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint coldly said, “You think I’m not furious? Do you think I don’t have any resentment? He wouldn’t be in this position if he was willing to leave with me back then. Do you think I don’t want him to become an Emperor quickly and have to wait for his lifespan to come to an end before fighting for that slight chance? You think...”

As the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint spoke, tears rolled down the corner of her eyes, and she furiously said, “You know how much he owes me? He can never return the favor to me for the rest of his lifetime! You know how much I hate him? I hate why he’s so stubborn, wanting to fight for that slight chance even now. Does he not know that many people are worried about him? He owes me so much, and I have never forgotten it...”

Sensing the terrifying Emperor’s Tribulation, the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint’s heart finally collapsed. She roared, “Jian Wuming, you better live well! Otherwise, I won’t let you die peacefully, and I mean my words!”

The Serene Dust Great Saint yelled, “Jian Wuming, did you hear that? This madwoman can do what she says, and I can’t stop her if she wants to slaughter the entire Sword Sect if you die!”

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint looked at the Serene Dust Great Saint furiously. But the Serene Dust Great Saint didn’t cower and glared back at the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint, and they burst into laughter a moment later.

At the Indigo Firmament Peak, the Dragon Origin Great Saint was stationed there, looking at the terrifying aura released by the Emperor’s Tribulation. He drank wine as he looked at the crimson clouds, recalling his past with the Radiant Sword Saint. He recalled how they traveled to the Kunlun Realm with Serene Dust and Heavenly Jade, his happiest time.

They were also once young, arrogant, and talented. But everything started to change when the Radiant Sword Saint bluffed him to practice a divine body-refining technique as he became their meat shield, and he couldn’t remember how many times he received a beating.

The Dragon Origin Great Saint couldn’t help smiling upon thinking about that and raised the gourd to gulp down wine. The past belonged to the three of them, but it somehow became three, with him becoming insignificant. So how did he endure it? He couldn’t remember how he endured it. Was it because of the Serene Dust Great Saint? Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

He fell in love at first sight with the Serene Dust Great Saint, the young girl who always called him to hurry up and run. Thinking about it, tears rolled down the Dragon Origin Great Saint’s eyes as he gulped down the wine to numb himself.

The Radiant Sword Saint is sinful!

But in the end, he stayed behind because of the Radiant Sword Saint. Whenever he got into trouble, the Radiant Sword Saint would clean up for him, and the Radiant Sword Saint would stand out whenever he was bullied. When they fought with their lives on the line, the Radiant Sword Saint would never abandon him and was never missing.

Protecting the entire Ancient Barren Domain with one sword. The oath the Radiant Sword Saint made when he was young was fulfilled throughout his lifetime.

The Dragon Origin Great Saint didn’t want to admit it, but he had been chasing after the Radiant Sword Saint. He smiled, “Your disciple is the same as you. He’s great, but he’s also my disciple now.”

Tears rolled down the Dragon Origin Great Saint’s eyes, but he became even more determined. He didn’t have much lifespan left, and he only lived thanks to the Divine Blood Fruit from Lin Yun, and he had already seen through death. So, he came here with the mindset to die.

“Jian Wuming, I’m here again. You better buck it and turn the table around like in the past. This Emperor’s Tribulation is nothing!” The Dragon Origin Great Saint continued to gulp down the wine.
