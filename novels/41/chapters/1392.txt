Chapter 1393 - Test

Everyone was shocked by Ye Ziling’s fiery temper. They never thought that she would dare to rebuke Jiang Tian’s question. After all, Jiang Tian was a genius on the Elysium Core Ranking!

He was ranked in the twenty thousandths on the Elysium Core Ranking. It might not sound impressive, but it was because the Elysium Core Ranking didn’t have any restrictions on age. If the ranking was limited to those under one hundred, Jiang Tian could easily make it into the ten thousandths. If it were limited to thirty, it wouldn’t be a problem for Jiang Tian to make it into the three thousandths.

This was a terrifying ranking. In the past, when Qin Cang challenged those on the Elysium Core Ranking, he lost more than he won. So this was the same as being toyed around by those in the Elysium Core Ranking.

Everyone looked at Ye Ziling and was curious about her origin. Could it be that she had an even more terrifying origin than the Jiang Saint Clan? They also noticed the purple lightning, dragon, and snowflakes enveloping Ye Ziling. With just a glance, they could tell that her bloodline wasn’t ordinary, and anyone could tell that Ye Ziling’s identity wasn’t simple.

“Who is she? Did she just talk back to the Jiang Saint Clan? Isn’t she afraid of Jiang Tian?”

“She practically crippled Jiang Tao before the Jiang Saint Clan. Even if Jiang Tao is from the branch, this is still slapping Jiang Tian’s face. I bet Jiang Tian will probably act in response.”

A disciple from the Flowing Cloud Sect said, “She and those from the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect are simply barbarians from the Profound Azure Prefecture. That woman is a demoness and must’ve chanced upon some sort of inheritance!”

“Profound Azure Prefecture? That’s too far away. It’s simply at the border of the Eastern Desolation, and it’s not an exaggeration to call it the wilderness.”

“So they’re from the wilderness. It’s no wonder why they didn’t place the Jiang Saint Clan in their eyes. I’m afraid they don’t even understand the meaning of a saint clan.”

“It makes sense, now that you look at it that way.”

As murmurs resounded from the surroundings, Jiang Tian’s face sank with a cold light flashing through his pupils. “Cripple her. No one can get away with offending the Jiang Saint Clan, not even if she’s a woman. Break the hand she used to injure Jiang Tao!”

Jiang Tian wasn’t a kind person. He wouldn’t make it on the Elysium Core Ranking if he was. Most of those on the ranking were over a hundred years old, and some were even a few hundred years old. They had great experiences and were ruthless. So if one wasn’t relentless and courageous enough, it was practically impossible for them to gain a footing on the Elysium Core Ranking.

When Jiang Tian was done, several geniuses from the Jiang Saint Clan sped towards Ye Ziling.

“Senior Sister, we’ll help you!” Feng Zhang and Liu Qingyan also charged over. They had a strong relationship since they had been following Ye Ziling for a long time in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. So when they saw Ye Ziling facing the Jiang Saint Clan, they charged over and met the Jiang Saint Clan’s geniuses.

Feng Zhang and Liu Qingyan didn’t hold back, so both sides clashed and gave it their all. They also shocked all the audience members when they saw Feng Zhang and Liu Qingyan holding their own against the Jiang Saint Clan’s geniuses, especially Feng Zhang.

Since losing to Lin Yun, his entire person has transformed. After he refined the Golden Dragon Bone Soup, his strength was extremely close to a Greater Elysium Core Realm expert.

“You guys are taking it too far!” Feng Zhang reinforced Liu Qingyan after seeing that the latter was having difficulty holding his own after defeating two people. As starlight enveloped the surface of his body, a crackling sound came from the bones all over his body. Simultaneously, a faint golden membrane also appeared on the surface of his body, giving off a golden metallic luster that looked like a dragon bone being activated.

Feng Zhang had activated the Golden Dragon Blood and Golden Dragon Marrow in his body. When he pushed his palm out, a golden dragon roar echoed and the Jiang Saint Clan’s geniuses facing Liu Qingyan were sent flying back.

“Storming Wind and Cloud!”

“Soaring Azure Sky!”

“Clouds Manifesting Dragon!” Feng Zhang didn’t stop there and followed with four forms from the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords. When he used the last form, he used his fingers, which looked like a dragon claw, as a golden sword, manifesting an ocean of golden clouds that tore apart the chest of one genius from the Jiang Saint Clan.

As blood splashed from the chest of that genius from the Jiang Saint Clan, the genius then rolled down the stairs. This scene left everyone shocked.

“Are they really barbarians from the Profound Azure Prefecture? They suppressed even the main branch’s geniuses. Isn't that a little too terrifying?”

“What’s with the dragon roar from his body? Why do I get the feeling that these people have refined the Divine Dragon Blood?”

“How is that possible? How can Divine Dragon Blood possibly appear in the Profound Azure Prefecture…”

“Not only the Divine Dragon Blood. The membrane on the surface of his body seems to be manifested with Golden Dragon Marrow.”

The strength that Feng Zhang revealed shocked everyone. From the power that he had shown, he didn’t look like a barbarian from the Profound Azure Prefecture at all.

“He’s strong but too reckless to face the Jiang Saint Clan.” One of the audience sighed. The Jiang Saint Clan was one of the top ten saint clans in the Ancient Barren Domain, which meant they had a deep foundation. Over the past three millennia, they produced more than a saint. At their peak, they had three saints in a generation.

Although they were no longer at their peak, they were still a giant in the Ancient Barren Domain. Not only did they have many geniuses, but they also took in many disciples as a force, including many talented geniuses. Those geniuses defeated by Feng Zhang couldn’t even reach the top ten amongst the Jiang Saint Clan’s younger generation.

“Looks like there are many fearless people here. Jiang Xing, you go and deal with him!” Jiang Tian coldly said. When he was done, a figure soared to the sky with his palm descending. This person had used a high-grade holy spirit martial technique right from the start, the Terranean Palm.

Jiang Xing had reached the pinnacle of greater mastery with the Terranean Rivus Palm, and he was one of the top ten amongst the younger generation in the Jiang Saint Clan. With his palm descended, boundless starlight converged into a river that roared.

Moreover, Jiang Xing’s cultivation was at the Greater Elysium Core Realm, which meant that his cultivation was a whole stage above Feng Zhang's. Not to mention that Terranean Rivus was a powerful holy spirit martial technique. It didn’t just consist of a palm technique but also a movement and sword technique that came along with it. Only direct descendants of the Jiang Saint Clan were qualified to practice it.

His attack placed Feng Zhang under tremendous pressure. When Ye Ziling locked her brows together and wanted to make a move, Feng Zhang’s voice resounded, “Senior Sister, you’re always the one standing before us. Let me stand before you this once. I’ll prove to them that disciples from the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect aren’t frogs in a well or barbarians!”

His words surprised Ye Ziling, but she was gratified that Feng Zhang and the others had grown up.

“Hahaha! How can frogs know they’re in a well? Let me show you how high the sky is!” Jiang Xing charged over with a river manifested with starlight circling his palm, emitting a dazzling light.

But Feng Zhang let out a cold bark with his arms spread apart and pushed his palms out, unleashing a bright sun. When the river and sun collided, they both took several steps back and were evenly matched.

“Learnt that from Qin Cang?” Lin Yun could tell that Feng Zhang’s attack was similar to the Golden Dragon Skypatching Art that Qin Cang used. Then again, it was only somewhat similar because Feng Zhang fused his own comprehension and Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords into it.

Feng Zhang had worked hard when he said he was only one step from becoming a Greater Elysium Core Realm expert after refining the Golden Dragon Bone Soup. Back then, when he fought Qin Cang, Feng Zhang probably gained a lot of insight just by watching him. He carefully researched Qin Cang’s martial techniques and fused his own comprehension.

This made Lin Yun both surprised and impressed.

“Not bad, but I’ve only just started!” Jiang Xing was furious when he couldn’t defeat Feng Zhang. He immediately drew his sword and a river coiled around him like a dragon, with his sword aura instantly enveloping Feng Zhang.

“Jiang Xing is only ranked in the top ten? Why do I feel that he’s even stronger than the chief disciples of many sects? His Terranean Rivus Sword Art is a little unpredictable.” Many people exclaimed when they sensed Jiang Xing’s aura after he drew his sword.

So they couldn’t imagine that Jiang Xing was barely ranked in the top ten amongst the younger generations in the Jiang Saint Clan. Since Jiang Xing was weaker than Jiang Tian, how strong was Jiang Tian?

“Looks like that senior brother of yours is a little weak.” Gongsun Yan’s voice resounded beside Lin Yun, flashing light through his pupils. He naturally wanted to blow up the matter because this meant he could spread his name. A saint clan? Gongsun Yan was confident that it would just be his stepping stone!

“Senior Brother Feng grew up too late. So even if he had his opportunities, his foundation is still a little lacking, not to mention that he has a lower cultivation level. It’s already impressive that he can persevere till now,” said Lin Yun.

“Need my help?” Gongsun Yan grinned. “After all, you helped me once. Others might fear a Saint Clan, but not me!”

“Let’s wait a little longer,” said Zhao Yan.

“Don’t listen to this fool. If you continue to wait, those bastards from the Jiang Saint Clan might really cripple an arm of your senior sister.” Gongsun Yan spoke in disdain.

“Even I can roughly recognize the origin of Lady Ye. So what do you think of Jiang Tian?” Zhao Yan replied.

“What do you mean?” Gongsun Yan was baffled.
