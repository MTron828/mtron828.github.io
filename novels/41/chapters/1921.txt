Chapter 1922 - Fated Woman?

“Holy shit!” Everyone’s eyes were blazing with flames of jealousy, looking at Wang Muyan taking the initiative to hug Ye Qingtian. They were shocked, even more than Ye Qingtian beating Wang Yue. After all, it was too unbelievable that the Heavenly Yin Holy Maiden took the advantage to hug Ye Qingtian. This struck a great blow to them, and their hearts nearly shattered as they watched Ye Qingtian and Wang Muyan leave just like that.

“Ha!” Bai Shuying’s face became cold upon seeing this scene. She didn’t hate Wang Muyan because she knew that Wang Muyan was a demoness, to begin with. She hated Ye Qingtian, who claimed to love her, but it turned out that they had long gotten together. Thinking about what Ye Qingtian said to her again, she found him shameless.

While watching Ye Qingtian leave with Wang Muyan, Zhang Yue gritted his teeth, “He’ll be sucked dry by that demoness sooner or later!”

Ye Feifan nodded his head in agreement upon hearing that.

“Haha!” What they said was heard by someone else, and that someone smiled, “That makes sense. After all, Ye Qingtian didn’t have a habit of carrying the Sky Pillar Pellet with him wherever he goes like Senior Brother Zhang, so it’s expected that he’ll easily be sucked dry.”

That voice wasn’t soft, and everyone heard it, causing them to laugh. This made Zhang Yue’s face red with shame. He turned around and roared, “Who said that?!”

Ever since that incident, everyone within the Heavenly Dao Sect knew he’s small and powerless, needing to carry the Sky Pillar Pellet wherever he goes. This made Zhang Yue become the greatest laughingstock within the sect, but no one dared to mention it to his face.

“Me!” Wang Yue coldly looked at Zhang Yue.

“You’re nothing but a loser. You better hope that you don’t run into me!” Zhang Yue said coldly.

“So what if we run into each other?” Wang Yue sneered. “Unlike you, I don’t need the Sky Pillar Pellet.”

“You’re courting death!” Zhang Yue flew into a rage and could no longer contain his temper. But Ye Feifan quickly pulled him away, fearing that he might go against the rules and have the Quasi-Saint expel him from this place.

After Lin Yun and Wang Muyan walked far away, Lin Yun said, “There’s no one here, so you don’t need to carry on your act anymore.”

Wang Muyan chuckled as she loosened her hand and said in a grieving tone, “I just helped you earlier…”

“They can’t do anything to me even without you. Even a Saint Elder can’t see through anything, so why would I fear those two pieces of garbage? Not to mention that I’m Ye Qingtian, to begin with,” Lin Yun said indifferently.

“Ye Qingtian, Zhang Yue and Ye Feifan aren’t pushovers. You’ll suffer sooner or later if you maintain such a high profile,” Wang Muyan smiled.

“You’re trying to teach me?” Lin Yun glanced at Wang Muyan; he didn’t want much interaction with her.

Wang Muyan smiled and grumbled, “Big Brother Tian, can you not be so fierce to me?”

“I have nothing to say to you, so just stay away from me,” Lin Yun said indifferently.

“Ha. Don’t tell me you don’t want to know the secrets of the Solar Lunar Divine Rune? You don’t want to know about the past of the Eastern Desolation’s Three Sword Saints?” Wang Muyan looked at Lin Yun with a playful smile.

Lin Yun stopped, but he soon quickened his footsteps. He wanted to know, but he couldn’t believe her. When the time comes, he plans to capture her, then he’d know everything.

“Haha. We still have an opportunity to cooperate. To express my sincerity, I can answer a question that has nothing to do with it.” Wang Muyan knew there was room for maneuver when Lin Yun briefly stopped.

Lin Yun stopped and turned around. He asked, “I do have a question.”

“Go on,” Wang Muyan said, knowing Lin Yun had taken the bait.

As Lin Yun looked at Wang Muyan’s face, he asked, “Your appearance can barely be considered clean and not peerless. So why would others go insane whenever they look at you?”

He had long noticed it when they first met but couldn’t find anything special about her. Back then, he was curious as to why Ye Qingtian would fall for her, and the only explanation was probably her voluptuous figure.

Wang Muyan rolled her eyes and smiled, “That’s a secret. But if you want to know, you must tell me a secret in exchange.”

“Sure.” Lin Yun agreed, waiting to hear Wang Muyan’s explanation.

“I’ve practiced the Heavenly Yin Secret Canon. So as long as someone has a wisp of desire in their heart, it would magnify my beauty when they look at me and think of me as the most beautiful woman in their heart,” Wang Muyan smiled. “My look is different in the eyes of everyone, but they only need a glance to recognize me, even if the most beautiful woman had changed in their eyes.

Lin Yun pondered over what she said, but it could barely be considered as an explanation. But rather than calling it the Heavenly Yin Secret Canon, it was more like the Heavenly Yin Desire Canon. He asked, “What about me, then?”

Gently biting on her lips, Wang Muyan glanced at Lin Yun, “Big Brother Tian has no desire in your heart, and this is why you can see through the illusion. This proves that Big Brother Tian is a gentleman. But what you see isn’t my true appearance. Only those who truly love me in their heart with no desire can see my true appearance. So you’re heartless.”

Wang Muyan said with a playful smile, and her tone was numbing even if she didn’t have any outstanding appearance in Lin Yun’s eyes.

But Lin Yun merely inwardly sneered. He believed her first part, but not the second part.

“It’s your turn.” Wang Muyan looked at Lin Yun with her pupils shining brightly.

Lin Yun took out the Flower Burial Sword and said, “I also have a huge secret. This sword is called the Azure Indigo Sword, used by the Southern Emperor three thousand years ago. This is a sword of true love… The one who can draw it out is my fated woman and can see my true appearance.”

“So touching. Big Brother Tian, I’m still a child. You won’t bluff me, right?” Wang Muyan smiled, and she ‘unintentionally’ squeezed the mountains on her chest as she spoke.

A child? Lin Yun maintained his composure and smiled, “I’m naturally speaking about the truth. You can give it a try if you don’t believe it!”

It was truly the sword of the Southern Emperor, but the name was Flower Burial, and had long formed a connection with Lin Yun. So it would be weird if Wang Muyan could draw it out. As though the Flower Burial Sword knew what Lin Yun thought, it began to vibrate as if it was provoking Wang Muyan.

“I’ll give it a try, then.” Wang Muyan’s face blushed, and she took the Flower Burial Sword from Lin Yun. The sword was drawn out when she tried and revealed a bewitching luster. But Wang Muyan didn’t seem satisfied and gave it several more attempts, all of which were successful.Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Interesting.” Wang Muyan tossed the sword back to Lin Yun and sneered, “Ye Qingtian, you’re a scumbag. Is this how you bluff others? Fated woman?”

On the other hand, Lin Yun was dumbfounded as he received the Flower Burial Sword before looking at Wang Muyan in disbelief. He still couldn’t process what just happened.

Wang Muyan wore a playful smile and said, “Your acting isn’t bad, but did you really take me for a child? I’ll let you off today. When the Ranking Battle ends three days from now, tell me your real name!”

After she was done, she left with a smile on her face.

But Lin Yun still couldn’t process what had just happened. He returned to the Indigo Thunder Peak and entered the Iris Secret Realm, handing the Flower Burial Sword to Lil’ Red. He said, “Try pulling it out.”

This time, the sword couldn’t be drawn out no matter how Lil’ Red tried, even after taking on the Dracoape form. This made Lin Yun nod because this was how it should be.

“Let me give it a try.” Lil’ Purple appeared out of nowhere and snatched the Flower Burial Sword. She gently tried to draw it and quickly drew the Flower Burial Sword out, and this immediately left Lin Yun dumbfounded, looking at Lil’ Purple.

“How did you do it?”

“This is only a sword, not a divine artifact. So why can’t I draw it out?” Lil’ Purple asked.

“Then how did Wang Muyan manage to do it?”

“Who?” Lil’ Purple asked.

Lin Yun simplified his explanation and told Lil’ Purple what had happened. But he drew a disdainful glance from Lil’ Purple. She replied, “You’re a scumbag to think I’m your fated woman. I’m a phoenix, so you can only continue to dream about it!”

When she finished, she ran off and didn’t give Lin Yun any explanation.

It took a long time for Lin Yun to calm down, and he finally realized that there was an issue with Wang Muyan, and he couldn’t underestimate her. He now realized that none of the holy maidens within the Heavenly Dao Sect were pushovers.

It took him a while to calm himself down before he called Lil’ Purple over to discuss with her the Celestial Purging Mountain’s fourth level. The next round of the Ranking Battle was three days from now, and Lin Yun planned to ascend to the fifth level during this period. It would be great if he could grasp the Astral Sword Intent.
