Chapter 1245 - Dual Sword Souls!

Feng Jue’s expression became uneasy and awkward because he had seen a similar scene not too long ago. He began to wonder who he offended. He just made a breakthrough to the Samsara Edict Realm with great difficulty and wanted to show off to Jian Jingtian, only to suffer a few times instead. In the end, he was still the junior brother who couldn’t do a thing to Jian Jingtian even if he had reached the Samsara Edict Realm.

He first let Lin Yu borrow 200,000 divine astral pellets. Then, he lost seven dragon origin pellets to Jian Jingtian through chess. He only had nine dragon origin pellets to begin with that his master gave to him after making a breakthrough. He couldn’t even bear to use them, but somehow, Jian Jingtian managed to swindle him and take seven. Now, he only had two left.

“The dragon origin pellets should be extremely precious, right?” Lin Yun asked.

“Of course. Only saints can refine them, and it’s not easy for them. They have to capture the Divine Dragon Era’s origin aura beyond the 36 layers of heavens and refine them. A single dragon origin pellet is equivalent to roughly 100,000 divine astral pellets. Then again, the dragon origin pellets are a lot more precious because of the origin aura contained within them,” smiled Jian Jingtian.

Lin Yun felt his scalp tingle when he heard that. It turned out that they were a lot more impressive than he had imagined. It was something that only saints could refine. This also meant that dragon origin pellets were rare, and every single one of them was extremely precious.

“Yeah, I only have two left now.” Feng Jue nodded his head. In reality, refining the dragon origin pellet wasn’t as simple as Jian Jingtian had imagined. It was true that only saints could refine them, but not every saint could do so.

Hearing that Feng Jue had two dragon origin pellets left, Lin Yun’s eyes lit up, and he spoke with an embarrassed smile, “Erm… Senior Brother, can you lend me two?”

Feng Jue almost threw up a mouthful of blood when he heard that. How could dragon origin pellets be loaned out?

“Haha, looks like this senior brother of yours isn’t so impressive after all. I’ll lend it to you instead. In the future, when you’re in the Sword Sect, remember to speak good words for me.” Jian Jingtian smiled and started to reach out to his interspatial pouch.

Feng Jue’s brow twitched as flames blazed in his pupils. After all, he couldn’t accept someone speaking poorly of him when he was standing right there. So Feng Jue immediately stopped Jian Jingtian, “Wait! Junior Brother, I didn’t say that I won’t lend any to you. Don’t be fooled by this old geezer, you have no idea how he’ll con you. Here, take these two dragon origin pellets!”

As he spoke, he took out the dragon origin pellets.

“Senior Brother!” Lin Yun held onto the jade bottle containing the dragon origin pellets and the corner of his lips twitched. He realized that this senior brother of his was a little… naive. Couldn’t he see that the old geezer was provoking him on purpose? Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“No need to talk. I know that your heart is touched, so just take it.” Feng Jue smiled before he looked at Jian Jingtian coldly with a smug face.

Seeing this, Jian Jingtian merely smiled.

Lin Yun took the dragon origin pellets and was about to throw one onto the altar without inspecting them. But right at this moment, Jian Jingtian stopped Lin Yun and handed him an interspatial pouch, “It’s too much of a waste to use dragon origin pellets on the altar. Here are 100,000 divine astral pellets, you can use them instead.”

Hearing that, the smug look on Feng Jue’s face disappeared as he glared at the interspatial pouch and roared, “You old geezer, why didn’t you take it out earlier?!”

“I’m not like you. I’m not lending these to him. I’m giving them to him!” Jian Jingtian said in disdain.

Feng Jue’s pride instantly died down as his entire aura was suppressed by Jian Jingtian. He said, “Junior Brother, you don’t have to pay me back anymore for the divine astral pellets!”

Lin Yun was dumbfounded when he heard that because fortune came too quickly. This immediately caused a smile to appear on his face. Looking at Feng Jue again, he realized that his senior brother was so adorable.

“The divine firmament sword intent is profound, so comprehend it well. As for the Profound Wither Island, you don’t have to be in such a hurry. I’ll inform you if there are any changes,” said Jian Jingtian with a grave expression.

Lin Yun nodded his head when he heard that. He had only just grasped the divine firmament sword intent, so he needed time to comprehend it.

“Junior Brother, cultivate well.” Feng Jue said before leaving with Jian Jingtian. When they returned to the clouds, Feng Jue couldn’t help asking, “Speaking of which, since when are you so generous to give out 100,000 divine astral pellets? That’s so unlike you.”

Jian Jingtian glanced at Lin Yun and said, “Lin Yun didn’t tell you about it? He plans on leaving behind the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sutra and Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords before leaving for the Sword Sect.”

Feng Jue was completely dumbfounded when he heard that. After all, those two weren’t something you can simply buy with 100,000 divine astral pellets. Clearly, Jian Jingtian had gotten a huge bargain. He also instantly realized that Jian Jingtian was conning him again because he was now broke.

Back on the altar, Lin Yun looked calm but he was filled with excitement in his heart. The divine firmament sword intent had far exceeded his expectations. Plus, he got even more wealthy because of the divine astral pellets and the dragon origin pellets.

Lin Yun’s purple forehead mark started to shine and a golden sword ray exploded from his pupils. At this moment, he looked like the sun. Then, Lin Yun spread his hands out before folding them over his chest. The golden human in his sword ocean also made the same gesture and emitted a dazzling brilliance in the next moment.

This caused Lin Yun’s sword ocean to surge with waves as an azure dragon broke out of the surface of the ocean and coiled around the golden human. Then, the azure dragon flew out and manifested into sword rays that spread everywhere.

Under the sword rays, everything was reduced to dust. Even the remnant spiritual energy in the atmosphere was swiftly disappearing, turning the surroundings into a void. This scene greatly shocked Lin Yun because the power was too terrifying.

If anyone was enveloped by the light from his azure dragon sword soul, they would be instantly restricted and unable to absorb the spiritual energy from the surroundings. If they lost the support of their origin energy, this would strike a great blow to their martial intent.

If his enemies were slightly weaker, the sword ray would instantly reduce them to ashes. After all, even the spiritual energy in the surroundings had been reduced to nothing, so how could anything be left of his enemies. Even if his enemy was strong, they would be restricted when they realized that they were in a region without any spiritual energy. Just thinking about it made Lin Yun full of awe.

“What if the sword ray didn’t spread out?” Lin Yun began to think. The sword ray enveloping him slowly dissipated and returned to his forehead, manifesting into the golden azure dragon in the sword ocean. But compared to before, the radiance of the azure dragon was a lot dimmer.

Taking a cold breath, Lin Yun didn’t let his sword soul recover and gave it another try. But his next few attempts were futile. Whenever he released the azure dragon sword soul, his control would get weaker. In fact, it couldn’t maintain its shape and turned into a few streaks of light.

When those streaks of light collided with the war drums, it made Lin Yun throw up a few mouthfuls of blood. The power of the war drums was a lot more terrifying than in the illusion realm and not even his divine firmament sword intent could bear it.

“Weird, so why did I succeed on the first try? Was it purely a coincidence?” Lin Yun’s expression became depressed. After all, if his trump card couldn’t be controlled, it would greatly decrease the value.

If he couldn’t attack his opponent, then he would only exhaust his sword soul like an idiot.

“So is it impossible?” The corner of Lin Yun’s lips twitched. He initially thought that he would have a few more trump cards and was wondering what he should name his powerful attack. But it seemed like he jumped the gun.

Lin Yun knew that he missed the crucial part. As he locked his brows together, he began to walk around the altar and his emotions gradually became agitated. He couldn’t figure it out even though a lot of time had passed. “How good would it be if Lil’ Purple was here? She would definitely know something about this.”

Taking a deep breath, Lin Yun took out the Divine indigo Jade Bamboo Flute and started blowing on it. Not long later, the flute music began to spread over this mountain range, and his heart gradually calmed down after one song.

As thoughts flashed through his mind, Lin Yun’s eyes suddenly lit up. He suddenly recalled what Feng Jue said earlier, “Dual sword souls!”

Feng Jue was greatly shocked when he heard that Lin Yun had dual sword souls. Could it be that the golden human was also controlling the azure dragon sword soul? It was mimicking me…

If this is true, I can use a sword soul to control another sword soul. As Lin Yun’s thoughts cleared up, a smile appeared on his face once more because he had a feeling that he was right.
