Chapter 1256 - Insanity

The newcomer was naturally Luo Hua, who arrived late. After looking at everyone, Luo Hua said, “Sorry about that. The Profound Wither Island only allows those in the Empyrean Realm to enter, so I’m late.”

Lin Yun instantly speculated that Luo Hua might have already reached the Elysium Core Realm. It looked like she had a secret technique to suppress her cultivation to the Empyrean Realm, fooling the restriction left behind by the Profound Wither Great Saint.

But he knew that such a means also required an immense price, and the price might be related to cultivation. It was still alright for those in the Lesser Elysium Core Realm, but it would be hard for those in the Greater Elysium Core Realm. As for those in the Heavenly Elysium Core Realm, they might even have the pay a price with their life.

“No worries,” said Ye Ziling as she calmly looked at Luo Hua. After everyone seated themselves on the profound astral bird, they raised their heads, and saw that the crack in the sky had already closed up and the Sword Sect’s party could no longer be seen, not even Mu Qingqing, who left last.

In just this short moment, they had already lost track of the Sword Sect’s party. This made Jiang Lichen lock his brows together and unhappily said, “They’re really fast at running away. They ate so much from the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, and weren’t even willing to wait for a little while.”

In the end, he concluded that they were all ingrates, and it was fortunate that they weren’t allowed on the Sword Saint Mountain.

“It’s actually good that we’re not together. That Zhang Ting was really annoying, as well as that Qin Tian, who only knows how to act aloof. I have to say that Senior Brother Lin really has a good temper.” Both Feng Zhang and Liu Qingyan were unhappy with the Sword Sect’s disciples who were too arrogant. As the profound astral bird flew into the air, the group chatted while they were on the back of the bird.

“You suffered grievance?” Luo Hua asked.

“Nothing much. I was just treated like a fly,” replied Lin Yun.

When Jiang Lichen heard that, he couldn’t help speaking out, “That bastard’s face was already swollen with a slap and yet he still acts so arrogant, thinking that Junior Brother won’t be able to catch up to him. Junior Brother didn’t bother him, but he said that Junior Brother is just a fly. In my eyes, he’s the fly instead!”

“Perhaps he thinks that I will never be able to catch up to him,” smiled Lin Yun.

“Junior Brother killed your way from the lesser realm and already acquired such strength in just half a month. They have no idea how strong your potential is!” Jiang Lichen was fully convinced of Lin Yun’s strength and had long thrown away his prejudice against him back then. This was also why he was so furious when Lin Yun was looked down upon by those from the Sword Sect.

As they chatted, the profound astral bird broke through the barrier of heaven and reached the third layer. In the third layer, the profound astral bird’s speed would greatly increase, and if it wasn’t for the barrier from the profound astral bird protecting them, there was no way they could bear the speed.

The entire journey was calm. Six hours later, Ye Ziling suddenly said, “We’re here.”

Lin Yun was surprised that they had already reached their destination so quickly. After all, they took a long time when they previously came to the Profound Wither Sea. But the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect only had one profound astral bird, and it was an ordinary one.

The one rode by Mu Qingqing was even faster and she had probably arrived a long time ago. Right at this moment, a violent storm manifested with thunderclouds suddenly sweeping over. The storm was too terrifying. It was just a hundred-odd feet when they first looked at it, but when they looked at it again, it had become a few thousand feet.

This instantly made Ye Ziling’s face change because she knew that they were in trouble now. A thundercloud storm of this scale was rare in the third level, and even those in the Dragon Pulse Realm would be in trouble when facing it. This meant that their luck was pretty terrible. But just when everyone panicked, the thunderclouds were suddenly torn into pieces by a powerful wind.

“Mhm?” Ye Ziling had no idea what was going on, but she didn’t think too much about it and controlled the profound astral bird to go down, breaking apart the third layer of heaven and appearing under the clouds. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

This made everyone let out a deep breath of relief. If they were caught in the thundercloud, they would have been heavily injured, even if they managed to survive, and this meant that they would miss the Profound Wither Island.

“That was weird.” Ye Ziling muttered.

Standing on the profound astral bird, Lin Yun looked around and could sense the existence of a faint sword intent lingering in the surroundings. This aura was well hidden, and he wouldn’t have been able to sense it if he didn’t grasp the divine firmament sword intent.

“Hehe, there’s no need to look around. It’s your senior brother!” Feng Jue’s laughter resounded within Lin Yun’s ears. “Your senior brother is already an expert in the Samsara Edict Realm. Later, when you’re near the Profound Wither Island, you can beat up anyone that you don’t like. Don’t worry about it because you have me behind you.”

Lin Yun speculated that it was Feng Jue, and he now obtained confirmation from Feng Jue personally. But this senior brother of his was pretty interesting. He might be in the Samsara Edict Realm, but he never heard anyone calling themselves an expert before.

“Someone from the Sword Sect, too?”

“Sure, but there’s no need for that.”

“……” Lin Yun was speechless when he heard that. Wasn’t that bullshit?

“Hehe, you can beat them up if you want, but they also have a Samsara Edict Realm expert, not to mention that they have the advantage in numbers. So if you go there, you’ll be beaten up rather than beating others up,” smiled Feng Jue.

“The Profound Wither Island is different now!” Ye Ziling said in a surprised tone.

When Lin Yun turned his gaze over, he was also shocked to see the current appearance of the Profound Wither Island. There were several cracks to the powerful storm surrounding the Profound Wither Island that could even kill saints. At the same time, there was a rainbow streak that shot out from the cracks.

Anyone could sense that the places the light enveloped had incredibly dense spiritual energy. Even the best place in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect couldn’t be compared to the density of spiritual energy being enveloped by the rainbow light.

The several large islands around the Profound Wither Island were occupied by powerful sects, so no one else dared to go on them. The islands further away were also filled with people, including the sky. At the same time, there were streaks of light gathering together from various directions, and they were cultivators who arrived after hearing about the Profound Wither Island.

“The Profound Wither Island is really going to open up!”

“I heard that the light only appeared today, and treasures have appeared on the islands enveloped by the light.”

“Even an ordinary herb grew into a towering tree and bore seventh-grade saint fruits!”

“The seal to the Profound Wither Island hasn’t officially been broken. I can’t imagine what kind of place the Profound Wither Island will look like.” The discussions were resounding from the surroundings and even made the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s party feel their blood boiling.

“Isn’t it a little too exaggerated? Don’t tell me all the Empyreans from the Ancient Barren Domain have come.” Jiang Lichen sighed.

Lin Yun speculated that Jiang Lichen might not be wrong. After all, this was a grand event and the Profound Wither Island was simply too tempting.

“That seems to be the island occupied by the Sword Sect!” Feng Zhang pointed at an island enveloped in sword aura and the flag of the Sword Sect could be seen on it.

“Are we going?” Liu Qingyan asked. There was no question that there would be less trouble if they joined up with the Sword Sect, and they might even be able to find treasures on that island enveloped by the light.

Lin Yun wasn’t bothered by it because he still had a good impression of most of the people from the Sword Sect, like Mu Qingqing, who had been courteous to him the entire time. He could tell that she wasn't acting, but Lin Yun instantly felt uncomfortable when thinking about Zhang Ting’s group.

“Forget it. There’s no need for us to join up with them. Let’s find a place to descend first, then we have to find out what happened to this place,” said Ye Ziling. The rainbow lights were bizarre, and it was best for them not to be rash.

The profound astral bird flew around before it finally descended on an outer island. The island was small, and there wasn’t much light on this island as well. But even so, this island was filled with people.

It took them half a day before they managed to find an opening. Like the surrounding islands, this island wasn’t calm. It was filled with people from both the righteous and demonic sects. Occasionally, when a treasure appears, it would spark a storm of blood and even the islands occupied by the powerful sects weren’t peaceful, either.

Those islands were close to Profound Wither Island, and this meant that the value of the treasures found there were much higher. Even if the islands were occupied by the powerful sects, it was unavoidable for others to be tempted by the treasures on the islands, not to mention that the powerful sects weren’t too peaceful amongst themselves, either.

Just when the group settled down, a rainbow light suddenly soared into the sky from the island and a dense fragrance soon enveloped the entire island. Just from the fragrance alone, anyone could tell that this was a fruit that was at least a thousand years old.

“This is too exaggerating, thousand-year fruits like cabbages found everywhere.” Jiang Lichen widened his mouth looking in the direction the fragrance was coming from.

“They’re all insane.” Liu Qingyan’s lips twitched while looking at the multitude of people charging over. He immediately dispelled his thoughts because he knew that there would be many people fighting over one fruit.

“I’ll go take a look,” said Lin Yun before he soared into the sky. He was terribly broke right now and was nowhere near to gathering five million divine astral pellets. So he was tempted by the thousand-year fruit. Fruits were born absorbing the essence of the sun and moon, so a thousand-year fruit was equivalent to a few thousand divine astral pellets.

If he could collect enough fruits, he could also form his constellation, even without five million divine astral pellets.
