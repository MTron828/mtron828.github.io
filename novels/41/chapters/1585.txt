Chapter 1586 - A Hundred Thousand Years Of Loneliness

An hour later, Lin Yun stowed the Golden Crow Wings after confirming that no one was chasing after him and descended to an empty ground. When he landed on the ground, he threw out a mouthful of blood, with his face becoming pale.

After Lil’ Purple flew out from the sword box, she patted Lin Yun’s back, and icy flames circulated within her body. The fire incinerated all the dragon origin that Jiang Tong left within his body.

A brief moment later, Lin Yun threw out a mouthful of blood. After he was done throwing up, he soon felt at ease, with a chill spreading within his body. His injury might not be fully healed, but the pain had disappeared, and his body became rosier. Moreover, it was rare for the Lil’ Purple to help him.

“Looks like you have more means now after reaching the Dragon Pulse Realm.” Lin Yun wiped the trace of blood off his lips and looked at the silver flames blazing within Lil’ Purple’s pupils. The flames were emitting a chill that looked dazzling.

“Hmph. Of course, I’ve become stronger after using so much True Dragon Saint Liquid.” Lil’ Purple said proudly. “Furthermore, did you forget that I’m the Divine Phoenix Clan’s Supreme Heavenly Slaughter Empress of Four Seas, Eight Barrens, 36 Heavens, and 72 Earths!?”

Lin Yun smiled because it had been a long since he last heard of Lil’ Purple reciting her title. He found it annoying in the past, but hearing it occasionally was pretty interesting, and he couldn’t help rubbing Lil’ Purple on her head.

“Hey, scumbag. Don’t touch me. It’s not easy to tie my braids!” Lil’ Purple looked at Lin Yun with disdain as she struggled free from his hand.

“It’s fine. I’ll tie it for you again if it's messed up.” Lin Yun smiled.

“Hmph, I don’t need you to tie it.” Lil’ Purple still recalled how Ye Ziling ‘disguised’ her, and she ran off with her face turning red.

Lin Yun was baffled upon seeing Lil’ Purple’s face blush. With a smile, he placed Lil’ Red on the ground and asked, “Lil’ Red, are you alright?”

He still recalled how Lil’ Red was in pain earlier, and his face turned eerie whenever he thought of it. This was why he decided to flee. Aside from Jiang Tong, the bone flute youth was practically the bane of Lil’ Red.

“Big Brother, I’m fine. When are we going to take revenge?” Lil’ Red scratched its head because it felt that what happened earlier was too embarrassing.

“There’s no rush.” Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts with his eyes flickering.Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Lord Lin, Lord Cat, and Lord Phoenix, I’m back!” The Demonic Rune Tiger appeared before Lin Yun with Chen Ling on its back.

“Hehe. Lord Lin, I’ve done as you said!” The Demonic Rune Tiger came before Lin Yun to boast of its credit, wearing a fawning smile. This scene left Chen Ling dumbfounded. Wasn’t this Demonic Rune Tiger a monarch demonic beast? It could be considered king in the mountain range. So why did it look like a domesticated cat?

“Junior Brother Chen, how are your injuries?” Lin Yun asked.

“I’m fine.” Chen Ling said. His injuries were heavy, but they weren’t fatal, and he could slowly recover from them with the use of pellets.

“Senior Brother, are you alright? Jiang Tong is a rising star on the Demonic Ranking!” Chen Ling said with a grave expression.

“Demonic Ranking?” Lin Yun asked.

Chen Ling was briefly stumped before he explained, “The Demonic Rankings are demonic cultivators with a bounty on their heads. It’s from the Demon Domain, but no one knows who came up with the ranking. But few people can kill demonic cultivators on the ranking in the Dragon Pulse Realm. All those who can make it on the ranking are terrifying geniuses!”

“How is it compared to the Dragon Pulse Ranking?” Lin Yun asked.

“No one is sure who’s stronger. But to a certain degree, those who can make it on the Demonic Ranking are more dangerous!” Chen Ling replied after a brief pondering.

Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts when he heard that. Generally speaking, there was no danger in challenging the Dragon Pulse Ranking. But those who could make it on the Demonic Ranking were born from a mountain of corpses. That didn’t mean that the Dragon Pulse Ranking was weak because it was more comprehensive, and there was the legendary Blue Dragon Ranking, where every genius made it on it regardless of their origin.

“I discovered several rising stars on the Demonic Ranking while training in the Withered Mountain Range. So I secretly followed them, wanting to find their motive before delivering the information back to the sect. But I was discovered in the process. Fortunately, you came.” Chen Ling said with lingering fear.

Lin Yun and Lil’ Purple exchanged a gaze as they both smiled. Chen Ling might not know, but they knew they must be after the Black Tortoise’s Saint Blood. Without any hesitation, Lin Yun shared it with Chen Ling.

Chen Ling was startled upon hearing that. “We have to deliver the information back to the sect! We can’t let them get it!”

“It’s too late.” Lil’ Purple said. “The Black Tortoise’s Saint Blood can aid tribulation, but it has to be used within four hours. It’ll take three days to travel back and forth the Sword Sect, and it’ll already be too late when reinforcements come, not to mention that…”

Lil’ Purple suddenly stopped. Lin Yun naturally knew what she wanted to say, and he said, “It’s alright. Just tell him about it.”

“Furthermore, this piece of information was told to Lin Yun by Mu Xueqin. The Sword Sect already knows about them, but they just didn’t expect that there would be so many rising stars from the Demonic Ranking here.” Lil’ Purple continued.

Upon hearing that, Chen Ling finally knew why Lin Yun was also here. It turned out that it wasn’t a coincidence.

“But we’re placed in a tough spot now.” Lin Yun furrowed his brows. He initially only wanted to retrieve the ominous ice aura and the Black Tortoise’s Saint Blood along the way, but he didn’t expect it would be so troublesome.

Just Jiang Tong was already so troublesome, not to mention that there were other rising stars of the Demonic Ranking. This made all the trump cards that he had prepared seem insufficient.

“You should give up on the Black Tortoise’s Saint Blood and just retrieve the ominous ice aura, instead.” Lil’ Purple said. “Even if you’re strong, you’ve just reached the Dragon Pulse Realm. You might be able to face them one-on-one, but you’ll be in trouble if you face a few more of them.”

“Only retrieve the ominous ice aura?” Lin Yun looked at Lil’ Purple, and he continued, “You belittle me. I want the Black Tortoise’s Saint Blood and the ominous ice aura. I’m just planning how I can leave safely after that. I can’t be bothered about the other rising stars on the Demonic Ranking, but Jiang Tong and his companion have to die!”

He still wasn’t done taking revenge. Without mentioning that Lil’ Red was tortured, they had killed many disciples of the Sword Sect, which was enough reason for him to make a move against them.

“Do you have a way of dealing with that bone flute youth?” Lin Yun could feel the music dao from that bone flute youth, and that youth’s attainment in the music dao was much stronger than his own. So Lil’ Red’s fighting prowess couldn’t be of any help with that bone flute youth around.

“It’s a piece of cake with me around!” Lil’ Purple said.

“Hehe. Lord Phoenix is mighty!” The Demonic Rune Tiger took this opportunity to flatter Lil’ Purple. He might be late when it comes to flattering, but he would never miss it.

“Hmph.” Lil’ Purple was a little furious as she continued, “But I’m not helping you. You’re too overconfident and will behave after being taught a lesson.”

She turned her head away and didn’t want to talk to Lin Yun anymore. Lin Yun was clearly heavily injured, but he still wanted to fight them. Did he really think that he wouldn’t die? Lil’ Purple lowered her head, and her eyes became red.

Seeing Lil’ Purple throwing her tantrum again, Lin Yun inwardly sighed and glanced at Lil’ Red. Lil’ Red quickly sped over to Lil’ Purple, along with the Demonic Rune Tiger. But Lil’ Purple felt terrible and buried her head in her knees, not bothering with those two.

“Senior Brother Lin, who is this young lady?” Chen Ling asked weakly.

“Don’t ask. She can hear what you say, and I can’t protect you if she’s angry. Just the Demonic Rune Tiger is enough to kill you.” Lin Yun said, scaring Chen Ling into becoming quiet with those words.

While Lin Yun sat on the ground, he closed his eyes to heal his injuries. While healing his wounds, he recalled every detail of his fight with Jiang Tong. They didn’t use any martial techniques in their fight, and they were both probing each other. But Lin Yun had resorted to the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron!

He couldn’t complement the difference in their dragon origin, and the outcome might be better if he had used his sword. But the Wind, Fire, Lightning, and Ice Sword Forms were only at lesser mastery, and Lil’ Purple had no intention of giving him the ominous auras. So it was a little dangerous if they fought.

His actual trump cards were the Sovereign Dragon Fist and the Sovereign Divine Rune in the sword box. At the crucial moment, he could also activate the Origin Divine Rune on the Blue Dragon Bone to avoid danger. He had some odds of winning, but on the prerequisite that the other Demonic Ranking’s rising stars wouldn’t make a move.

When Lin Yun reopened his eyes, the sky became dark. He had recovered from his injuries along with his dragon origin, vitality, physique, and dragon runes. When he turned to look at Lil’ Purple, she seemed to have fallen asleep.

“Senior Brother.” Chen Ling was beside Lin Yun.

Lin Yun was initially planning on sneaking away, but he bitterly smiled, seeing the determination in Chen Ling’s pupils. “Alright. You can follow me, but you must leave when the fight starts.”

“Okay.” Chen Ling nodded.

“Let’s go to the Cold Pond!” Lin Yun said with a cold light flashing across his pupils.

“Lin Yun, you can leave but leave behind the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute!” Lil’ Purple stood on a massive rock without any expression on her face. “I taught you the music dao. So you’re not allowed to use it!”

Lin Yun bitterly smiled in his heart because he knew Lil’ Purple was furious this time. After all, she didn’t give him the ominous auras and even wanted to take the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute away. After all, that was a trump card to deal with that bone flute youth. His music dao wasn’t that youth’s opponent, to begin with. Without the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute, it would only be harder for him to face that person.

Taking out the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute, Lin Yun took a deep breath and said, “You know that I won’t refuse you if you ask for it.”

“I naturally know that.” Lil’ Purple said as the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute flew over. She felt terrible in her heart because she naturally knew what Lin Yun thought.

Lin Yun was about to leave. He knew Lil’ Purple was worried about his safety, but he had a reason to go, no matter what. He couldn’t be bothered if those rising stars hunted the other sects’ disciples, but it was a different story since they dared to hunt disciples of the Sword Sect. Even if he left the Sword Sect one day, he wouldn’t watch and do nothing about it as long as he was a disciple of the Radiant Sword Saint. The blood feud of the Sword Sect could only be repaid with blood.

“You scumbag, you’re not allowed to go!” Lil’ Purple said in a sobbing tone, tears filling her eyes.

“You don’t understand. I have a reason to go, no matter what.” Lin Yun continued forth without turning back.

Tears welled up in Lil’ Purple’s eyes even more. How could she not understand Lin Yun? She wouldn’t care even if everyone from the Sword Sect was killed as long as Lin Yun was fine. But did Lin Yun understand her?

Lin Yun carried on his journey without turning back. But when a piece of flute music resounded, he couldn’t help turning back and looking at Lil’ Purple. She had chased Lil’ Red and the Demonic Rune Tiger away and played the flute on a rock. Her hair became silver and draped down her shoulders like a waterfall.

Retracting his gaze, Lin Yun sped off under the music.
