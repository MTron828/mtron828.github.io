Chapter 2006 - Udumbara Flower

The Blood Crow King became furious and charged at Lin Yun, pushing its speed to the limit. It didn’t know any martial techniques nor Martial Intent, but it lived for three thousand years. Its cultivation had reached a terrifying height. In addition to its powerful physical talent and fighting instincts, it was still powerful.

After Lin Yun clashed with it head-on several times, his arm felt numb, blood dripping from his palm. He no longer dared to belittle the Blood Crow King and changed his fighting style, unleashing his Golden Crow Wings and using his speed to handle the Blood Crow King.

But the Blood Crow King wasn’t weaker than Lin Yun in regards to speed. It might not know any Martial Intents, but its body was constructed for talent and knew how to use its advantage well. Lin Yun couldn’t obtain any benefits as they clashed and even suffered a small loss.

“The demon is injured!”

“All hail the king! Kill this demon and take revenge for our clan!”

“We have to tear him apart! His corpse must be a lot more delicious than other cultivators!”

“Kill!”

The Blood Crows became excited. They were simple-minded, having already decided how to split Lin Yun’s body up before the battle had even concluded.

“How troublesome.” Lin Yun hovered in the air and squinted his pupils, looking at the Blood Crow King’s wings. Its wings were sharp, emitting a silver metallic luster that was tougher than ordinary myriad-rune saint artifacts. He had to get rid of the Blood Crow King’s wings.

The Blood Crow’s weakness was its wings. The moment its wings were injured, it would be crippled. Lin Yun noticed that the Blood Crow King, aside from the silver portion, had concealed its wings well.

“Hehe. Demon, what else do you have? Go on and release them. I’ll make you kneel today!” The Blood Crow King happily flapped its wings.

Lin Yun already had an idea and smiled, “We’re just getting started. No need to be anxious.”

Lin Yun flicked his finger, and the Flower Burial Sword flew out, turning into a streak of light. The Blood Crow King dodged before using its wings to knock the Flower Burial Sword away.

Seeing this, Lin Yun snorted and raised his hands, circulating the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra. When the petals flew out, they soon formed into a wall of Netherflowers. The scene of blooming Netherflowers was shocking, and it became a dark screen that spread a terrifying sword aura. Sword rays flew out as Lin Yun began flicking his fingers, “Flicking Divine Finger!”

Densely packed swords flew out like a waterfall, forcing the Blood Crow King to retreat. At the same time, the Flower Burial returned and tangled with the Blood Crow King by using the Divine Firefly Sword technique. In just a brief moment, the Flower Burial Sword left behind countless wounds on the Blood Crow King, with blood oozing out. This instantly placed the Blood Crow King in a pathetic state.

“Please spare my life! I won’t eat you anymore, and I’ll leave immediately!” The Blood Crow King could still continue to fight, but it began begging for mercy when it saw it was in a disadvantageous position.

“Too late!” Lin Yun waved his hand and recalled the Flower Burial Sword. He activated the glory spirits, thrusting his sword into the Blood Crow King’s neck with the Withered Tree Coming To Life technique.

“You demon!” The Blood Crow King screamed while gathering energy in its wings before it died. When the Blood Crow King was decapitated, Lin Yun was knocked back with the dragon runes on his body breaking apart. The nirvana aura around him was dissipating like fireworks as he slammed against a tree with blood dripping down his lips.

“What horrifying explosive power!” Lin Yun coughed and fell to the ground, landing on one knee, and his face becoming pale. He had underestimated the Blood Crows. Even if they weren’t intelligent or proficient in martial techniques, they had a strong cultivation. So even Lin Yun was nearly severed into, two despite possessing two saint physiques.

“The demon is injured! Kill him!” The Blood Crows flocked over when they saw that Lin Yun was kneeling on the ground.

“You guys are courting death!” Bai Qingyu and Lil’ Red dashed over, one using the Stalewater Sword and the other using its claws, easily beating the Blood Crows back. Lil’ Red even let out a roar, taking the Ancient Dracoape form and swinging its staff, starting a massacre.

“Hmph, do you crows think that I’m invisible?!” Lil’ Red roared, scaring the remaining Blood Crows into trembling with fear before they fled for their lives.

“Leave this place first!” Lin Yun said as he picked up a silver bead from the ground. The Blood Crow King’s sins actually condensed into a bead when it died, proving that it was precious.

“Ye Qingtian, I’ll bring you with me.” Bai Qingyu came over, wanting to carry Lin Yun on her back. But her face instantly became red when she grabbed his arm. She could barely support Lin Yun. “How heavy!”

Seeing this, Lin Yun sighed and carried her on his shoulder. He yelled at Lil’ Red before he quickly escaped. He might’ve been in a dangerous position if he ran into another Blood Crow King in his current state.

Five Blood Crow Kings appeared a few minutes later, bringing tens of thousands of Blood Crows, covering half of the forest. These Blood Crow Kings’ wing bones were silver, not just the edge of their wings.

“What a pity for Evil Crane King to die just like that. Such a young king, but he was too reckless,” a Blood Crow King sighed.

“Unbelievable. That demon is simply the bane of our clan. He showed the momentum to slaughter our entire race alone.”

“But that demon actually didn’t touch the Evil Crane King’s corpse. What a waste of such a delicacy,” a Blood Crow King said in disdain.

“Let’s split up the Evil Crane King’s corpse first before chasing after that demon.”

“Agreed!” The five Blood Crow Kings began to split the Evil Crane King’s corpse, swallowing it down.

“Kill the demon and take revenge for the Evil Crane King!” Thousands of Blood Crows began to search the entire Myriad Grave Valley. But Lin Yun’s group was prepared. Lil’ Purple had set up a spiritual array, which they used to hide from them.

The spiritual arrays were special; none of the Blood Crows detected them when they flew past. They were sensitive to vitality, but they couldn’t detect them.

“Wow! I heard that Blood Crows are sensitive to vitality, and not even an ant could escape their senses,” Bai Qingyu praised.

Lil’ Purple maintained her composure and said, “How can mere Blood Crows deal with my spiritual array? Not even a Saint can detect us.”

“Lord Phoenix is really impressive,” Bai Qingyu said with reverence in her pupils.

“This is nothing.”

“Hehe.” As they talked, Lin Yun focused on treating his injuries and held onto the bead in his hand. His sword intent greatly improved in this period, exceeding his expectation. The sins left behind by Blood Crow Kings were great nourishment, and even his cultivation became more refined.

When Lin Yun refined the bead, he opened his eyes with surprise. The astral in his forehead was blazing wildly with a powerful sword intent emitted out. His sword sea had expanded by one-third, and his Astral Sword Intent filled his body.

This was too unbelievable that the bead actually increased his sword intent by one-third. His sword sea reached over a thousand foot, and it was pure without any impurities. The entire sea was condensed with sword intent, and the destructive power was a hundred times stronger than magma.

“If I bring out my Astral Sword Intent now, I should be able to reach the top ten on the King Ranking with the Azure Dragon Sword Heart.” Lin Yun smiled, and he was filled with confidence.

“You’ve recovered?” Lil’ Purple asked.

“Where’s the Udumbara Flower? Any clues?” Lin Yun nodded.

“I can only confirm that it’s in the Crimson Mist Forest, but I don’t know the exact location. We have to rely on this lass instead,” Lil’ Purple said, looking at Bai Qingyu, who was also refining the sins. Bai Qingyu had also grown throughout this period and could refine the sins to strengthen her martial intent. She had been working hard throughout this period.

“I thought you’re joking. So it turns out that we really have to rely on her,” Lin Yun asked in a surprised tone.

“If her Natal Yin Saint Physique can awaken, I’ll have 30% confidence in finding the Udumbara Flower,” Lil’ Purple said.

“That low?” Lin Yun asked in surprise.CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“What do you think? The Udumbara Flower is a legendary flower that can save someone from death. It’s equivalent to another life and more precious than the Divine Blood Fruit. As for the Divine Blood Fruit, it can’t be compared to it,” Lil’ Purple said.

“Why haven’t I heard of it then?” Lin Yun asked, and he could feel his heart beating wildly.

“It’s only a legend, and no one has seen it before. It’s too mysterious,” Lil’ Purple said, scratching his head.

“Help me find it.” Lin Yun held onto Lil’ Purple’s hands emotionally.

“Let go of me! You’re hurting me!” Lil’ Purple said unhappily.

Lin Yun came to his senses and released his grip on Lil’ Purple. He asked, “Empress, you can do it, right?”

Lil’ Purple was shocked by Lin Yun's being so emotional, which was rare. Even if she had a habit of boasting, she had no confidence in her tone, “I can. It’s just an Udumbara Flower, but…”

“But what?” Lin Yun asked nervously.

“There’s a divine array beneath our feet, more terrifying than the Myriad Demon Peak. The Udumbara Flower is nothing compared to the person who set up the divine array. If we touched his array, the consequences would be unimaginable,” Lil’ Purple said.

Lin Yun took a deep breath to calm down. He noticed that he was a little too emotional earlier. When he heard of the Udumbara Flower, the first thought that came to his mind was that he could save his master with it. If it was effective, it was nothing, even if his master’s lifespan was ending. Without knowing, he clenched his right fist together and said, “Just give it a try.”

“I’ll go out and deal with those Blood Crows. We might be able to find clues from them!” Lin Yun said with determination.

There were too many Blood Crows, and they were the overlord of the Crimson Mist Forest. Other races were either chased out or enslaved by them. So no one dared to provoke the Blood Crow Tribe.

But Lin Yun wasn’t afraid. He could just launch a sneak attack on them, taking them down slowly. Even if he couldn’t find any clues of the Udumbara Flower from them, he could refine their sins to strengthen his sword intent. So he wouldn’t make a loss either way.

At night, he began to launch his assault, mainly targeting thousand-year Blood Crows. At his full strength, the Blood Crows were heavily injured with a sword before adding another sword to resolve them easily.

Three days later, Lin Yun had hunted hundreds of thousand-year Blood Crows, strengthening his Astral Sword Intent. He could sense a terrifying aura in the crimson mist when he turned in a certain direction. That was the Blood Crow Tribe’s nest where top-tiered Blood Crow Kings could be found. If he wasn’t careful, he might lose his life.

He simply killed a Blood Crow, emptying its insides and covering himself. He planned to look at the nest and see how strong they were, seeing if he could find an opportunity to hunt a Blood Crow King along the way.

As he flew with a Blood Crow beside, that Blood Crow asked, “Brother, have you heard that the five kings are discussing hunting the white-clothed demon? We will definitely succeed this time.”

“Oh, okay,” Lin Yun replied casually.

“Brother, what did you eat yesterday? Did you eat any humans? Let me tell you about it, humans are really delicious. But it’s a pity I can’t leave because the kings ordered us to search for the white-clothed demon. Brother, why aren’t you saying anything? Don’t tell me that you’re intimidated by that demon. Hehe, aren’t you embarrassed? Let me tell you about it. That demon is over a hundred foot tall, and he can devour a Blood Crow with a mouth. I heard he ate hundreds of Blood Crows in the past few days.”

Lin Yun was speechless because he came across such a talkative Blood Crow. He used his hands to control the wings to avoid this Blood Crow. But the Blood Crow followed behind him in excitement.

“Brother, your legs are really special. They’re like human legs,” the Blood Crow chuckled as it looked at Lin Yun.

Lin Yun could do nothing about it, and slaughtered that Blood Crow with a sword. When he entered the nest, there were over a hundred thousand Blood Crows, which made his scalps numb. Among them, five kings rested on an altar, emitting a terrifying aura.

Relying on the Blood Crow’s disguise, Lin Yun concealed his aura with the Divine Tortoise Transformation and slowly approached them.
