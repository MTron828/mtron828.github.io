Chapter 186 - Power of the Profound Martial Realm

It was a quiet night. Two youths and a horse sat by a bonfire, roasting an alpha wolf’s meat. Even though the alpha wolf’s meat was tough, it turned out delicious. It took them great effort to roast it and the one named Lin Yun even went as far as using his Violet Sacred Flame. He was probably the first person in history to use such a powerful flame to roast meat. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

But honestly speaking, the effect was remarkable. Lin Yun could control the Violet Sacred Flame at will. Using the Yin-attributed flame to roast the meat, he didn’t have to worry about the meat getting burnt. The seasoning gradually fused into the meat under his delicate control, bringing out the meat’s flavor. Furthermore, the golden grease blended perfectly with the seasoning, forming a beautiful golden layer around the meat.

After the meat finished roasting, a rich aroma spread out. Li Wuyou and the Dragon Blooded Horse drooled at the meat, waiting on Lin Yun to cut it. The two of them smiled at each other as they waited in excitement.

After roasting the meat, Lin Yun began to refine the alpha wolf’s beast core. As a Profound Martial Realm demonic beast, the spiritual energy contained in the Armored Fiendwolf’s beast core was enormous. It was also the alpha wolf, meaning that the beast core was even more powerful than normal.

Lin Yun and Li Wuyou’s jade pendants had already reached nine stars. They no longer had to waste any time gathering stars. They could focus on their cultivation instead. So, in the last half month, the beast cores that were obtained were divided by Lin Yun and the Dragon Blooded Horse. Naturally, Li Wuyou didn’t take any.

Thus, Lin Yun’s cultivation improved quickly, causing him to start coming in contact with the seventh orifice of the Xiantian Realm. Li Wuyou sat by his side and watched him refine the beast core. Li Wuyou wasn’t worried about Lin Yun breaking into the seventh orifice of the Xiantian Realm.

In the Xiantian Realm, as long as one’s cultivation technique and aptitude weren’t bad, making a breakthrough wouldn’t be a problem. All Lin Yun needed was to have enough resources. Lin Yun satisfied every criteria, not to mention that he had his powerful white pellet. Compared to ordinary Xiantian Pellets, it was on a whole new level. The difference could be regarded as a leap in quality.

Lin Yun’s aura began to surge. He started to release sword aura from his body, which brought great pressure even to Li Wuyou.

“He made a breakthrough in his cultivation technique…” Li Wuyou knew that Lin Yun had made a breakthrough in his cultivation technique, which meant that Lin Yun wasn’t far from unlocking his heart orifice.

Lin Yun’s aura soared, attracting gusts of wind that blew on the surrounding trees.

When Li Wuyou saw this scene, he was shocked by Lin Yun’s foundation. Lin Yun was able to create such a commotion from a small breakthrough even though he was only in the Xiantian Realm. The surrounding trees had existed for thousands of years and they were tougher than metal. It wasn’t an easy task to make them sway in the wind..

Suddenly, the violent gust stopped. Then, a vortex formed around Lin Yun, drawing in the surrounding spiritual energy. Shortly after, Lin Yun’s aura began to retract and it ultimately disappeared. Lin Yun opened his eyes that were glowing brightly.

“Congratulations!” said Li Wuyou, with a stuffed mouth.

Lin Yun looked at him and couldn’t help smiling, “Eat slowly. I’ll go test my current strength.”

Now that he was in the seventh orifice of the Xiantian Realm and the Iris Flower’s petals had increased to thirty-four, Lin Yun was eager to test his current strength. He flicked his finger and a wisp of violet sword flash shot out.

The sword flash slammed into a tree, producing a loud noise. However,it had failed to penetrate the tree trunk. Lin Yun wasn’t surprised by the result. These trees had been here for a long time. Since it was hard to snap the branches off the trees, it was logical that the trunks were even tougher.

However, the sword flash had turned the fallen leaves into dust. There wasn’t any progress in his Divine Flicking Sword, but it had grown more powerful with his improved cultivation technique. However, there was more. The sword intent contained in the sword flash still lingered in the air, creating a buzzing noise.

“I still can’t pierce through it?” Touching the fine cracks on the tree trunk, Lin Yun felt somewhat uncomfortable. Perhaps he should change his train of thought.

“What are you doing?” Li Wuyou looked at Lin Yun in perplexion. He had no idea what Lin Yun was trying to do.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Lin Yun’s blood began to boil with the rhythmic heartbeat. Power started to gallop within his body like a wild stallion. This was the benefit of unlocking his heart orifice. The heart was vital to cultivators as it was the source of the body’s strength. If the heart stopped beating, the body would rapidly decline before facing death. Unlocking the heart orifice would strengthen his heart, allowing him to mobilize the blood in his body and unleash his blood instantly.

Suddenly, Lin Yun clenched his fingers together and threw a punch. His punch produced a huge boom from the tree trunk, but it was only enough to cause the tree to sway slightly and the leaves to fall. The commotion it caused wasn’t even comparable to the sword flash. But when Lin Yun withdrew his fist, Li Wuyou was shocked to see a massive hole on the tree trunk.

He immediately walked over and exclaimed, “How did you manage to do this?” Even someone in the Profound Martial Realm would have difficulty trying to drill a hole in the tree trunk.

“I fused the fist and sword. I also merged the soft and tough energies together.” Lin Yun smiled. He didn’t go into any more detail. Reaching the seventh orifice of the Xiantian Realm had boosted his strength significantly. But even so, Lin Yun still couldn’t pierce through the tree trunk.

The fist represented tough energy and the sword represented soft energy. The tree trunk wasn’t just tough, but it was also flexible. This was the reason why not even a Profound Martial Realm cultivator could pierce through it.

Although his Divine Flicking Sword was comparable to a Profound Martial Realm attack, he still couldn’t pierce through the tree trunk. This was the reason why Lin Yun chose a different approach.

“Big brother, you seem to have quite a bit of secrets on you,” smiled Li Wuyou. But he soon tossed this matter to the back of his mind.

Early the next morning, sunlight peered through the leaves onto the faces of Lin Yun and Li Wuyou. Lin Yun slowly opened his eyes to take a look around. The weather was pretty good, but it was a little too quiet. This wasn’t a good sign in the forest as it usually meant that something big was about to happen.

“There’s something wrong,” Li Wuyou said with a grave expression.

“Look over there!” Lin Yun pointed out. A few hundred meters away, a Blackflame Crow was sitting on a tree branch, staring at them coldly.

“It’s that fellow!” Li Wuyou immediately recalled Mo Qingyun, who could manipulate Blackflame Crows.

Lin Yun instantly knew that Wang Ning was targeting him again. He suddenly recalled Li Xiaotian’s warning yesterday. Lin Yun’s face stayed calm. Could it be that Wang Ning was trying to contact all the cultivators in the Profound Martial Realm to kill me? The more he thought about it, the more he felt that it was plausible.

“Let’s go!” Lin Yun kicked the Dragon Blooded Horse awake and hopped onto it, pulling Li Wuyou up in the process. He spurred the Dragon Blooded Horse who began charging through the forest in a daze. But it didn’t get that far when two figures appeared in their path, blocking the way.

“Han Mo!”

“Han Xiao!”

“Please enlighten us!” they shouted.

The two of them immediately summoned their Martial Souls. Their momentum immediately rose to a shocking level because of their Profound Martial realm cultivation. They pulled out their heavy swords and plunged them into the ground. The immense power behind the swords directly caused an explosion that surged towards the Dragon Blooded Horse like a tidal wave.

Thunderous explosions rang out from the two sword auras that were quickly approaching. Lin Yun narrowed his eyes into slits. He never expected that he would have to face two Profound Martial Realms, but he immediately retaliated without any hesitation.

“Abandon the horse!” Lin Yun and Li Wuyou landed on the ground, covered in small wounds. They weren’t able to avoid the all-out attack from the two Profound Martial Realms.

Han Feng and Han Mo charged out from the cloud of dust. But before they could make their moves, a wisp of violet sword flash shot at them. The two of them immediately placed their swords before them to defend themselves. When the collision occurred, the two of them were blown away.

“Let’s go!” Lin Yun pulled Li Wuyou and dove into the forest.

“My name is Feng Haoyu. Please enlighten me!” A figure suddenly descended from the sky, catching Lin Yun and Li Wuyou by surprise. Receiving a palm from Feng Haoyu, Li Wuyou spat out a mouthful of blood. He could feel his internal organs being grinded into pieces under the force. The pain made him inhale a cold breath by reflex and he had trouble trying to stand.

“Weakling,” Feng Haoyu sneered. But before Feng Haoyu could look over, Lin Yun sneered and threw a punch at him.

Feng Haoyu responded immediately by retaliating with another punch, “You’re courting death!”

“Get lost!” Lin Yun’s punch had blown Feng Haoyu away. The latter collided against a tree, producing a loud noise and vomiting blood.

Lin Yun had no idea how many enemies were around them, so he carried Li Wuyou on his back and continued running.

“What the commotion? What’s going on? What are they trying to do so early in the morning?” The commotion from the fights shocked everyone in the forest. Such a disturbance caused by cultivators in the Profound Martial Realm couldn’t escape anyone’s detection.

Sounds of horses galloping could be heard from Lin Yun’s rear. Wang Ning sneered as he chased Lin Yun. He had many cultivators in the Xiantian Realm following him. “I am Wang Ning. Anyone who is not related to this matter must leave this region immediately! Otherwise, you will face the consequences!”
