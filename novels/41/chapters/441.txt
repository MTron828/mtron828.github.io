Chapter 442 - Betting Rates

The two old men were furious when they saw the Dragon Blooded Horse’s goofy chuckle. It was bad enough that Lin Yun ate the crescent moon meat, but the Dragon Blooded Horse actually devoured the rest of what was in the pot.

“Are you trying to eat the pot as well?” Lin Yun smiled bitterly when he saw how the Dragon Blooded Horse gobbled down the food.

When Lin Yun placed the pot down, he could sense an irritable heat rising up in his body that sped up the healing of his injuries. To Lin Yun’s shock, he had actually stabilized his cultivation at the initial tenth stage in such a short period of time. But when the heat started to get more intense, Lin Yun’s eyes lit up when he saw the jar of wine on the ground.

“Stop!” The plump old man immediately called out. But Lin Yun couldn’t be bothered at this moment and started gulping down the jar of wine, which instantly sent a chill coursing through his body.

When he placed the jar back down, the pale look on his face disappeared. With a satisfied smile, Lin Yun chuckled, “Lord Thirteen, what wine was that? Give me another one.”

“Another one? Can’t you see that someone is on the verge of throwing blood?” laughed Lord Thirteen. His words made Lin Yun’s face change and when he turned his head over, he could see the plump old man’s face turning entirely black.

“Give it back!” The plump old man snatched the jar back, only to discover that it was entirely empty.

“I’m sorry about that, Pavilion Master. I’ll pay you with ten of them if there’s a chance in the future,” smiled Lin Yun embarrassedly.

“Ten? I spent ten years brewing one jar. How are you going to pay me back?” said the plump old man with indignance.

“That’s enough. It’s just a jar of wine. Lil’ Lin, try and throw a punch,” smiled Lord Thirteen.

Throw a punch? Lin Yun was baffled as he mustered his origin energy and threw out a punch. When he did, a huge booming echoed in the Sword Burial Woods and destroyed a patch of bamboo before him.

“Mid tenth stage? How is this possible?” Lin Yun was shocked by his power. He had just reached the tenth stage and all he did was eat a piece of meat and drink a jar of wine. Yet he somehow reached the mid tenth stage so easily?

“Why not?” The plump old man sneered, “You ate the essence of the Snowdragon Carp, the crescent moon meat, and drank the Coldpool Dew I spent a decade on. It’s equivalent to five years of cultivation.” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Don’t think too much about it. Rest well. I bet you never rested well in the Sword Burial Diagram,” smiled Lord Thirteen.

“Sleep? What do y-” Lin Yun collapsed on the ground before he could even finish his words.

When night came, the two old men looked at the sleeping youth with a gentle expression. In the end, Lin Yun was still a young lad.

“We’ll both leave after the competition. I won’t have any regrets if I can see him becoming the champion,” said Lord Thirteen.

“Do you think that’s possible?” said the plump old man as he looked at the youth.

“Who knows? At least he’s more outstanding than the both of us when we were at his age,” responded Lord Thirteen.

“Even if he becomes the champion, I’m afraid someone might not let it go so easily. After all, those people even dared to kill Xin Jue…” Compared to Lord Thirteen, the plump old man’s face was grave.

“Is that so? Then they can’t blame me for flipping the table,” declared Lord Thirteen with a cold flicker across his eyes.

When Lin Yun woke up the next day, he felt energetic and bade farewell to the two old men. The Dragon Gate Competition was starting soon and the plaza was filled with people before dawn arrived. A nearby inn, the Idlecloud Pavilion, was also filled with people since the early morning.

This was because the Myriad Treasure Pavilion cooperated with the Idlecloud Pavilion to set their bets here. On the first floor of the Idlecloud Pavilion, there was a massive stone table engraved with pictures of beasts. On the table, there were sets of names which reflected the thirty-two candidates in the Dragon Gate Competition for people to place their bets on.

“His Highness’ bets are getting lower and lower. It looks like the Myriad Treasure Pavilion and other commerces are optimistic of him beating Egret.”

“Yeah, Egret’s rate was only 1:2, but it shot to 1:4 after bumping into His Highness. The champion’s rate is even higher, it’s actually 1:6.” The crown prince was the most popular candidate for obtaining the championship without Drifting Goblet’s participation, even when facing Egret.

But even so, there were still some who placed their bets on Egret. In their opinion, Egret was a genius from the Divine Guards, so that means that he might not be entirely helpless in front of Qin Yu. Furthermore, he also had such a high rate.

The other bets that received the most attention were Bai Lixuan against Zuo Yun and Heartcliff against Tong Yuan. More and more people came to place their bets after seeing that the Dragon Gate Competition was starting.

“Lin Yun’s rate against Twilight is actually 1:10. Another word for 10 is death. Does the Myriad Treasure Pavilion think that Lin Yun will die?”

“Haha, this rate is interesting.”

“Lin Yun’s performance was brilliant and he practically swept past everything. I never imagined that his rate would be so high against Twilight.” Everyone was discussing Lin Yun’s fight with Twilight. Lin Yun had attracted everyone’s attention in the first round and he didn’t let anyone down.

But it was a pity that he ran into Twilight. Aside from the battle, Lin Yun’s rate of making it into the quarterfinals, finals, and championship was horrendous. He was just like Heartcliff, but Heartcliff would be gratified if he was here because his highest rate stopped at 9. On the other hand, Lin Yun’s rate reached 10 and the rate of him reaching champion even exceeded 10.

Right at this moment, a figure squeezed through the crowd and placed 100 second grade spiritual jades on the table, which instantly attracted everyone’s attention. He then pushed it towards Lin Yun’s name and said, “All in.”

“Heh, brother, you’re going to lose. You’re practically giving money to the Myriad Treasure Pavilion.” Someone laughed out loud when they saw this scene. Then, he pointed out, “I advise you to bet on Twilight instead. The rate might not be high, but a win is still a win.”

“Heh, I can bet on whoever I like with my money.” The youth was naturally Li Wuyou. He won quite a bit from the previous bet, so he would definitely not give up on this opportunity.

“What an idiot. I bet 100 second grade spiritual jades on Twilight, Lin Yun will die!” A snort sounded out as Tong Yuan appeared. He took out the spiritual jades and placed them on Twilight before looking at Li Wuyou with mockery on his face.

His appearance instantly caused an uproar. He might’ve lost to Lin Yun, but his strength left a deep impression on everyone. In many people’s view, it wouldn’t be an issue for him to make it to the quarterfinals as long as he didn’t bump into Lin Yun.

“I know you. So it’s someone who lost to my Big Brother. What’s wrong? The loss three days ago wasn't bad enough for you?” rebuked Li Wuyou.

“Am I wrong? So what if he defeated me? He’ll still die after running into Twilight,” sneered Tong Yuan.

“Bet on Lin Yun, 300 second grade spiritual jades,” a clear voice sounded out right at this moment. It turned out that the voice belonged to Liu Yue. She first took out 300 second grade spiritual jades to place it on Lin Yun before taking another 100 second grade spiritual jades to put on Egret. With that, the bets on Lin Yun suddenly increased by 400 second grade spiritual jades.

“Why are you betting so much? Don’t tell me that you’ve fallen for my Big Brother?” chuckled Li Wuyou.

“It’s none of your business,” snorted Liu Yue. Many people knew about her grudge with Lin Yun, so Li Wuyou couldn’t help feeling curious.

“How busy.” A bald head suddenly appeared, which shocked everyone. The bald head belonged to a monk who was holding onto a jar of wine and wearing a big smile.

“Drifting Goblet!”

He was the champion of the previous competition. Taking a sip of the wine, he smiled, “Let me join in as well.”

Flicking his finger, a perfect spiritual jade flew out from his hand, which left everyone shocked. A perfect spiritual jade was a third grade spiritual jade. Second grade spiritual jades were rare enough and you could only see them in the hands of clan’s descendants and sect’s disciples. Some people might not even see it once in their entire lifetime.

The spiritual jade flew and fell onto the bet that Lin Yun would become champion. This made everyone suck in a cold breath.

Even Liu Yue and Li Wuyou didn’t place any bets on the champion, but Drifting Goblet actually bet on Lin Yun becoming a champion with a third grade spiritual jade.

“Champion it is, 1:11, what an incredible rate,” smiled Drifting Goblet as his eyes narrowed into slits.
