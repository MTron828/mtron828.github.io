Chapter 2440 - Husband and Wife United! (1)

Su Ziyao’s strong stance stabilized the situation on Scarlet Firmament Peak.

“There’s an order from the holy master to kill whoever dares to stand in the way, and the Ninth Princess isn’t an exception.” The Light Subduing Great Saint fighting Mister Ghost and the Demon Clan’s Great Saints roared anxiously when he saw this scene. This relieved the Heavenly Sever, Flame Crow, and Heavenly Glory Great Saints. They might not have dared to move against the Ninth Princess without those words.

“I’m impressed that the Ninth Princess can break my domain. Why don’t we exchange a few moves?” The Heavenly Sever Great Saint stepped forward, looking at Su Ziyao eerily.

“Heavenly Sever, come at me if you dare. What kind of man are you to bully the Ninth Princess?” Jian Jingtian roared with his face changed.

“You think I don’t dare? Even if you’ve grasped the pinnacle of the eighth-grade sword intent, I still have ways to deal with you. But I just can’t be bothered with you for now. Ninth Princess, do you dare to fight me since you managed to break my domain?” The Heavenly Sever Great Saint asked coldly.

The Great Saints from the Pellet, Emerald, and Azure Firmament Peaks arrived at Scarlet Firmament Peak. The Great Saints from the Profound Sky Sect’s faction grew to eleven, giving off a powerful aura. Five out of six Great Saints that were stationed on the three peaks also arrived, and they were all heavily injured with pale expressions.

There was nothing they could do about it since there was a massive difference in their cultivations, not to mention that they didn’t have ruthless people like the Dragon Origin Great Saint or Ye Guhan. Even the other peaks were barely holding on.

Upon seeing this, Mu Xuankong’s face became grave, and even Jian Jingtian frowned. On the other hand, the morale of the Profound Sky Sect’s faction increased with smiles on their faces.

“Ninth Princess, do you dare to fight me?” The Heavenly Sever Great Saint asked, looking at Su Ziyao. The reason why he targeted Su Ziyao was because he was someone who took revenge. Since Su Ziyao destroyed his domain, he would trample on her to take revenge. Secondly, Su Ziyao had a high status, and the Sword Sect would be at their mercy if he managed to capture her.

“Are you that certain that you can defeat me?” Su Ziyao asked calmly.

“I don’t dare to say that I can crush you with one hand, but I can defeat you with one hand. If you disagree, all of us can charge forth. At that time, you guys would no longer have a chance,” the Heavenly Sever Great Saint said.

“Come then,” Su Ziyao said coldly, flashing a cold light across her eyes.

The faces of those from the Sword Sect changed because they didn’t know what Su Ziyao did to destroy the Heavenly Sever Great Saint’s domain. But judging from the aura she was giving off, she was only a Saint Sovereign, at best. She must have had an encounter in the God Burial Mountain Range; otherwise, her cultivation wouldn’t have risen so quickly.

But a Saint Sovereign was still a Saint Sovereign, and there was no way they could fight with an Immortal Stage Great Saint like the Heavenly Sever Great Saint.

“No!” Jian Jingtian called out. He was a Divinity Stage Great Saint, but he only managed to barely hold his ground, relying on Sword Sect’s energies and sword intent. But Jian Jingtian realized the Heavenly Sever Great Saint easily held him down when they fought.

After all, there was a reason why the Heavenly Sever Great Saint was the chief of Black Mountain’s Seven Saints.

Su Ziyao replied, “I can block him. The current situation is dangerous, so we can only wait for my husband, Lin Yun, to return. Since he believes in me, I will also believe in him. Please believe in me as well.”

Su Ziyao’s voice wasn’t loud, but it spread to every corner of the Sword Sect, shocking everyone as she addressed Lin Yun as her husband. Could it be that the two of them got married? One of the three beauties in the Kunlun Realm, Su Ziyao, has married Lin Yun?! But Su Ziyao’s confidence in Lin Yun was even more unbelievable to them.

“Hahaha! Even if Lin Yun comes, he’s only a Saint Sovereign, at best. If he doesn’t come, we might fear that he will become an Emperor. But if he dares to come, we’ll deal with him just like we will deal with you!” The Heavenly Sever Great Saint had a ruthless light flashing across his eyes. He might be a Great Saint, but he didn’t have the demeanor of one.

He was a petty person who would take revenge whenever he suffered a loss, and he was ruthless even after he became a Great Saint. Even though Su Ziyao was the Ninth Princess, he would still make her pay the price since she dared to destroy his domain.

With a single thought, he appeared before Su Ziyao. More accurately, he didn’t need to make a move personally and could easily kill a Saint Sovereign.

Even when facing the Heavenly Sever Great Saint, Su Ziyao showed no sign of panic on her face. A dao flower appeared behind her. It was the Imperial Dao, one of the thirty-six Sovereign Daos.

A dignified aura filled everyone’s hearts with awe when the flower bloomed. But that wasn’t all. A constellation opened up with countless Golden-Indigo Divine Dragons flying out from the painting.

But the Heavenly Sever Great Saint had no change on his face. The Sovereign Constellation, the Divine Dragon Constellation, and Imperial Dao might make Divinity Stage Great Saints fear her, but not the Heavenly Sever Great Saint. After all, he was a Great Saint at the pinnacle of the Immortal Stage.

“What a pitiful attempt to struggle. Kneel!” The Heavenly Sever Great Saint roared with a powerful aura sweeping out and his domain reappearing. But just when the pressure was about to fall on Su Ziyao, it was blocked by something, including his punch. The surrounding space solidified, and he had to break it apart slowly if he wanted to approach Su Ziyao.

“What’s going on?!” The Heavenly Sever Great Saint squinted with shock filling his heart.

A flower bloomed behind Su Ziyao, representing an Eternal Dao, the Truth Dao. That was the Truth Dao of the Nine Eternal Daos. At the same time, multiple golden figures began to appear behind the Scarlet Firmament Peak as though they had traveled through time to bow to Su Ziyao, singing a song about her glorious past.

That phenomenon was naturally the phenomenon of a legend, and this meant that Su Ziyao was a legendary talent. Like Lin Yun, she was a living legend just like the Nine Emperors.

“Before the truth, I am the monarch of the world!” Su Ziyao shook her flower crown and performed the Dragon Clan’s Imperial Dragon Fist, clashing with the Heavenly Sever Great Saint head-on.

When the two punches collided, Su Ziyao didn’t collapse like everyone had expected, but the Heavenly Sever Great Saint took a small step back instead.

Although the Heavenly Sever Great Saint wasn’t injured, he was naturally humiliated. He said, “It looks like the Kunlun Realm has changed a lot for a junior to grasp the Truth Dao. No wonder you’re so confident in facing me!”

With an even faster speed, the Heavenly Sever Great Saint charged forth, performing the Divinity Nether Seal he created.

Before the Heavenly Sever Great Saint, Su Ziyao calmly faced him with the Imperial Dragon Fist.

With the Heavenly Sever Great Saint becoming serious, Su Ziyao could only go on defense and would rather suffer an injury than take a step back. She wouldn’t and couldn’t take a step back as that was Imperial Dao. If she stepped back, the Imperial Dao would take a significant blow and drop in power. If she didn’t step back, the Imperial Dao would gradually become more powerful as she fought.

The saintly music continued to resound throughout heaven and earth as those majestic figures behind the Scarlet Firmament Peak raised their hands and saint radiance descended onto Su Ziyao in golden beams. When those golden beams landed on Su Ziyao, they swiftly healed her injuries and allowed her to recover.

The more she fought, the more courageous she became. Not only did she not take a step back, but her saint radiance became even more dazzling.

“She’s a living legend, and even the heavenly dao praises her!” Mu Xuankong was shocked at those golden figures that looked like records from ancient books. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Even the Azure Python Great Saint wore a grave expression, before he said, “She’s destined to be the monarch of the Kunlun Realm.”

On the other side, the faces of those from the Profound Sky Sect became ugly when they saw those golden figures. The Heavenly Sever Great Saint also became anxious and knew he couldn’t hold back. He had to quickly defeat Su Ziyao with an attack.

“Impure Yama!” The Heavenly Sever Great Saint circulated his domain as a massive yama that looked like the judge of hell gave off a powerful pressure with a faint divinity in its eyes. The eyes had a terrifying divine rune, and this martial technique far exceeded dragon spirit martial techniques.

“Great!” Su Ziyao soared to the sky before anyone could react. She pushed her right palm forth at the Impure Yama with the Annihilation Divine Rune engraved on the back of her hand, executing the Annihilation God Hand.

A bone hand enveloped in golden flames shot forth again with an annihilation aura. When the bone hand struck the massive yama, the yama’s head was crushed by that bone hand.

The collapse of the yama made the Heavenly Sever Great Saint throw out a mouthful of blood as he looked at Su Ziyao with shock. He exclaimed, “That’s the Annihilation God Hand! That’s the Annihilation God Lord’s inheritance! Su Ziyao... you received the Annihilation God Lord’s inheritance... How is that possible when you only possess a mortal body...”

After all, that was the hand of a deity. The Heavenly Sever Great Saint regretted this moment, and he finally knew how Su Ziyao managed to destroy his domain. After all, that was the hand of the famous Annihilation God Lord. It was a God Lord of the Kunlun Realm recorded in history who slew ten Demonspirit Clan deities by himself.

He was an undisputed war god of the Kunlun Realm, slaughtering the Demonspirit Clan to the point that they trembled in fear. Even when they were dead, they were suppressed beneath the God Burial Mountain Range, making the Demonspirit Clan grit their teeth, but there was nothing they could do about it.

“Before the truth, I am the monarch of the world!” Su Ziyao wore the flower crown Lin Yun made for her and gave off a dignified aura, making her look like a monarch. The position between her and the Heavenly Sever Great Saint changed as she forced the latter into defense, relying on the Annihilation God Hand to hold the advantage on Scarlet Firmament Peak.

But the hundred and eight outer peaks couldn’t hold on any longer. Many Sword Sect disciples were gathered on the Heavenly Prolong Peak, barely holding their ground as they faced countless Saint Lords and dozens of Saint Sovereigns.

There might be reinforcements from the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion and Divine Phoenix Mountain, but they had a huge disadvantage in their numbers.
