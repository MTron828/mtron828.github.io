Chapter 1213 - Sudden Change

The lesser Elysium Core Realm expert was donned in black and had completely merged with the darkness. He allowed Lil’ Purple and Lil’ Red to leave as he fixed his gaze on Lin Yun.

At the same time, the entire Huang Clan’s manor was enveloped in an intense fight. But for some reason, Lin Yun’s courtyard only had this lesser Elysium Core Realm expert. This couldn’t help making him feel weird. After all, didn’t these people come for the Lightning Shadow Sword?

But it didn’t take long for Lin Yun to figure it all out. All of these people showed up to test Lin Yun and Luo Hua’s strength. They were eyeing the Lightning Shadow Sword, and the leaders were practically all in the Dragon Pulse Realm. They could easily make arrangements to kill Lin Yun and only wanted to figure out Luo Hua’s background.

They wanted to know Luo Hua’s identity or else they wouldn’t make such a reckless move. But the feeling of being looked down on didn’t feel great. Lin Yun sighed because he was treated like a nobody even after reaching the Empyrean Realm.

“You’re alone?” Lin Yun asked.

“What do you think?” The black-clothed person said coldly. “Not many people are interested in you. After all, it’s impossible for us to leave with the Lightning Shadow Sword even if we managed to kill you. But I don’t care about that. I’m just after your life!”

The Lightning Shadow Sword was now a hot potato and no one was foolish enough to kill Lin Yun for it. Without enough strength, it would bring death to whoever owned it.

“You’re from the Feng Clan.” Lin Yun instantly recognized the identity of this person. After all, there was no need for anyone to target him if they were only probing his strength. Since he offended the Feng Clan, they would naturally come after him.

“You talk too much!” The black-clothed person’s eyes flashed coldly and he unleashed his aura in the Elysium Core Realm while charging toward Lin Yun.

Facing this person, Lin Yun pushed out his palm. As they collided, the courtyard behind him was instantly turned into rubble. The clash sent Lin Yun flying as he took several steps back and stabilized the astral energy in his body.

There was a huge gap between the Empyrean Realm and Elysium Core Realm, but those in the top 3,000 on the empyrean ranking could kill experts in the lesser Elysium Core Realm. However, all of those people were in the quasi-Elysium Core Realm. So it was impossible for a Galaxy Stage to defeat an Elysium Core Realm expert.

Lin Yun had cracks on his palm with blood flowing out. He now had a rough understanding of the gap between them. This was no ordinary Elysium Core Realm expert. However, if it was someone on the ranking, he would have died a long time ago.

“You’ve really surprised me. I can’t believe you reached the Galaxy Stage in one night. I initially thought that I could easily crush you like an ant…” The black-clothed person was shocked by the aura that Lin Yun was exuding. The reason why the Feng Clan sent him over was that they had determined that Lin Yun was only in the Heavenly Soul Realm.

If they sent too many people, it would blow their cover and become a huge hit to the Feng Clan’s reputation.

“Looks like I came at the right time. With your talent, you’ll easily make it into the top 3,000 on the empyrean ranking,” said the black-clothed person calmly while he took out a saint sword. It was a hundred-rune saint artifact.

At the same time, Lin Yun also waved his hand to retrieve the Lightning Shadow Sword. But the black-clothed person snickered when he saw this scene because a thousand-rune saint artifact was something that not even someone in the Elysium Core Realm could utilize, “How naive.”

Lin Yun was doomed to die even faster if he tried to use the Lightning Shadow Sword. As a cold light flashed, Lin Yun circulated the Golden Crow Nine Transformations and charged forward.

The black-clothed person shifted his body and swung his sword out at Lin Yun’s face. But Lin Yun gently pushed the Lightning Shadow Sword in the hilt to dodge this attack with great agility.

This annoyed the black-clothed person because Lin Yun’s talent in the sword was too strong. He didn’t even have the chance to suppress Lin Yun. He tried to attack several times and failed to claim Lin Yun’s life even though he held the advantage.

With that, the black-clothed person no longer held back and summoned his constellation. As a painting opened up behind him, the black-clothed person’s aura immediately surged and suppressed Lin Yun’s sword intent.

“So what if you’re a genius in the sword? It’s nothing before absolute strength!” With no hesitation, the black-clothed person swung his sword at Lin Yun’s neck. In the path of his sword, everything seemed as if it would be cut into two, leaving a huge gash on Lin Yun’s chest.

“Die!” A cold light flashed in the black-clothed person’s eyes as he pushed his strength to the limit to slice Lin Yun’s throat.

But his sword was actually stopped and Lin Yun stood firmly like a colossal mountain. At the same time, the 49 Demonic Astral Flowers began to blaze within his body. Lin Yun's aura had instantly broken through the restriction of the Galaxy Stage, reaching the pinnacle Astral Stage. It was even heading towards the lesser Elysium Core Realm.

The black-clothed person was shocked that his attack was so easily stopped by Lin Yun.

“Is this the best you can do? What a disappointment…” Lin Yun’s hair fluttered in the wind and his words made the black-clothed person’s heart sink. For some reason, he could sense death looming over him and quickly retreated.

Right at this moment, the sword cocoon in Lin Yun’s forehead bloomed and a golden aura began to blaze around it. The black-clothed person was instantly placed under great pressure as if he was bearing the weight of the entire sky.

Under the immense pressure, the black-clothed person froze. He felt relieved since Lin Yun hadn’t truly grasped the fourth-grade sword intent. But just when he thought about that, a sword ray flashed from the Lightning Shadow Sword.

The hundred-rune saint sword in his hand snapped instantly and the sword ray pierced his throat. When Lin Yun sheathed his sword, the lightning azure dragon around him dissipated.

“H-How is this possible?!” The black-clothed person held onto his throat with disbelief because Lin Yun actually managed to wield the Lightning Shadow Sword. But his head dropped to the ground before he received an answer from Lin Yun.

“Killing a lesser Elysium Core Realm…I should now be comparable to those in the top 3,000 of the empyrean ranking,” muttered Lin Yun. Even in the entire Eastern Desolation, it was impressive if one could reach the top 3,000 before the age of twenty.

For those that were in the quais-Elysium Core Realm, they didn’t need to rely on a saint artifact like Lin Yun had to. Then again, he was only in the Galaxy Stage. Even without using the Lightning Shadow Sword, he should be able to fight with those people.

Right at this moment, the ferocious roar of the dracoape sounded out and Lin Yun saw Lil’ Red wielding a staff to face a greater Elysium Core Realm expert head-on. There was also a white figure holding back two greater Elysium Core Realm experts.

It was Luo Hua who was fighting against two Elysium Core Realm experts. At the same time, there was zither music sounding out as she was using noble tunes to face two greater Elysium Core Realm experts.

As the music began to change, various phenomena began to appear around her like ink on a painting. When a majestic painting opened up behind her, it was an ancient city. The ancient city looked vivid, and the two greater Elysium Core Realm experts couldn’t do anything to her. But it was just a matter of time before Luo Hua’s music broke down.

“These people must be trying to see if there’s anyone around Luo Hua.” Lin Yun analyzed. If there wasn’t, then the Dragon Pulse Realm experts wouldn’t hesitate to make a move for the Lightning Shadow Sword.

Without any hesitation, Lin Yun took out the Divine Indigo Bamboo Jade Flute. It didn’t take long for the noble tune and quasi-divine firmament sword intent to flow from his music. As zither and flute combined together, the ancient city behind Luo Hua grew to a hundred feet in size, emitting a terrifying light.

When the music sounded out, boundless sword rays instantly sent the two greater Elysium Core Realm experts flying with traces of blood on their lips. When they saw Lin Yun coming over, they quickly yelled, “Leave!”

Just like that, the two black-clothed people left and disappeared when Lin Yun landed on the ground. They didn’t need to stay any longer because they got their answer. Luo Hua had an extraordinary origin, but she didn’t have anyone around to protect her.

Instantly, everyone that was attacking the Huang Clan left like they were never here. When Luo Hua stopped her zither, she turned to look at the wounds on Lin Yun’s chest. Although he had already recovered from most of his injuries, he still had a bloody stain over his chest.

“Are you alright?” Luo Hua came over with the zither as if it wasn’t a big deal fighting the two greater Elysium Core Realm experts.

“You’re their objective,” said Lin Yun.

“I know.” Luo Hua replied. “I don’t have any experts around me, but they’ll be disappointed to think that they can act against me because of it.”

“So what’s your identity? Why bother hiding it? Just reveal it!” Lil’ Purple descended from the sky and looked at Luo Hua unhappily.

When Luo Hua turned to look at Lil’ Purple, Lin Yun’s face changed because he could sense that Luo Hua’s aura had changed. She now possessed the aura of a monarch, looking down on all lives indifferently. Only when she looked at Lin Yun, would her gaze have a hint of gentleness. Lin Yun suddenly realized this was the first time he had sensed such a cold aura from her.

Then, a killing aura began to appear in Luo Hua’s gaze that made Lil’ Purple’s face turn pale. Fear flashed in her eyes as she hid behind Lin Yun. He could sense that Lil’ Purple’s hands were trembling. He had never seen her so afraid before.

“Lin Yun, move out of the way. She’s drowning with sins,” said Luo Hua. Luo Hua’s intent was blatant, she wanted to kill Lil’ Purple. This killing intent was something that she hadn’t shown even when facing the greater Elysium Core Realm experts, but it appeared when she looked at Lil’ Purple.

“Lin Yun, t-t-this empress doesn’t want to die… s-save me…” Lil’ Purple began to sob with a trembling voice.
