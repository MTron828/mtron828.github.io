Chapter 476 - Are You Feeling Proud?

So it turns out that the princess really was Su Ziyao. So why? Why did she hide it from him? Did she know that Lin Yun has been feeling guilty towards her?

She was Su Ziyao, the woman who helped him so much despite his pitiful position in the Azure Sky Sect. She gave him the Seven Exquisite Pellet to make up for his aptitude and she even tied a strand of her hair around his pinky. So why didn’t she want to turn around?

Scenes began to appear in his mind. Back then, he confidently wanted to repay Su Ziyao for her grace, but he didn’t expect that she would throw up a mouthful of blood instead.

“I only wanted to say that I have remembered all the things you gave me and I’m here today to repay you. I paid 40,000 low-grade spiritual stones for this Heavenly Origin Pellet, so please accept it. With that, I have repaid you for the kindness you showed me in the past. We’re even.”

All of a sudden, the temperature within the Mechanism Hall dropped and a chill swept out. The chill drilled deep into the bones of everyone present, making them tremble from the cold.

“Even?” Su Ziyao revealed a faint smile and a pale complexion, but it was a smile that seemed so heartbreaking, without the slightest bit of warmth. With her outstanding beauty, the smile on her pale face seemed so heartbreaking. As she took the Heavenly Origin Pellet, the smile on her face disappeared and was replaced with a frightening chill. At the same time, her aloof temperament returned to her face.

Her emotions seemed unstable and her face was frighteningly pale as she looked at Lin Yun, “I don’t usually give things out to others, but no one has ever dared to return anything I’ve given out. No one! But you, Lin Yun. You’re the first!”

Crack!

In the next moment, the Heavenly Origin Pellet, the dream of many people in the Aquasky Nation that cost 40,000 low-grade spiritual stones was reduced to ashes in Su Ziyao’s hand. The ear prickling sound of the bottle shattering when coupled with her aloof expression was terrifying.

At that moment, Lin Yun thought he had misunderstood Su Ziyao and that he must’ve forgotten something. But there was no chance for him to regret what he did in this world. On that night, Su Ziyao showed him the Flowing Wind Sword before she disappeared… That is until she reappeared Bloomphoenix Princess.

Returning back to reality, Lin Yun sped up the stairs and he stared at the gorgeous figure. If she wasn’t Su Ziyao, she wouldn’t have stopped her steps. Although he didn’t know why she appeared in the Azure Sky Sect, Lin Yun believed that she was Su Ziyao.

“Stop him!” Seeing that Lin Yun was disrupting the ceremony, many people yelled out furiously. Soon, the guards began to charge at Lin Yun.

“Get lost!” Lin Yun barked and unleashed the xiantian sword intent. His sword intent was boundless and all the guards were swept away before they could even get close to him.

“Xiantian sword intent!”

“Damn it, this sword intent is too powerful!” Many guards’ faces changed as they soon lost control of their weapons. Their weapons were deeply plunged into the stairs as Lin Yun ran up the stairs.

Lin Yun was focused and he was only looking at that figure before the throne. He wasn’t far from her now, and under the Seven Profound Steps, the flight of stairs was nothing to him.

But just when he was about to reach the top, a dangerous aura swept over. Before he could even react, a figure had appeared before him. It was the old man who had been protecting Su Ziyao. The old man didn’t utter a single word and merely pushed his palm over.

Before Lin Yun could get a clear look at his opponent, he threw up a mouthful of blood and was sent flying. When he fell onto the ground, he was back where he started. He looked at the figure with one knee on the ground.

“Please ascend the throne, Your Majesty!” barked the old man with a firm tone.

“Never!” The Iris Flower bloomed in Lin Yun’s dantian. Like a sharp sword, Lin Yun soared into the sky.

“Puny tricks!” Relying on his powerful cultivation, the old man suppressed Lin Yun’s xiantian sword intent. Just when Lin Yun was about to pass him, he pushed his palm out.

Under that palm, Lin Yun threw up a mouthful of blood and was sent flying once again. When the old man’s palm landed on him, cracks could be heard.

Lin Yun fell onto the ground, causing it to tremble violently. The shockwave made the guards’ faces change.

“Please ascend the throne, Your Majesty!” The old man’s voice echoed once more.

But Lin Yun got back up on his feet, this time with a pale face. Without any hesitation, he charged back up once more.

“This…”

“What is he trying to do? Does he think that he can compete with the old man?”

“The old man is the princess’ personal guard, right? Their strength isn’t even on the same level.”

“Is he courting death?”

After their initial shock, everyone began to feel suspicious. Anyone could tell that Lin Yun was acting on a belief, but no one knew what kind of belief was propelling him forward. But no matter how strong his belief was, it was futile before absolute strength. The moment he got close, he was sent flying by the old man.

“Please ascend the throne, Your Majesty!” The old man had no changes to his face. He was like a mountain the way he stood before Lin Yun. As long as he was here, he wouldn’t let anyone get past him.

Suddenly, his face changed because he sensed that Su Ziyao had moved. She didn’t walk towards the throne, but she suddenly turned around and grabbed onto Lin Yun.

Time seemed to have stopped at this moment, and a smile appeared on Lin Yun’s lips. The Bloomphoenix Princess wasn’t wearing a veil at this moment, revealing her identity as Su Ziyao. Looking at her being so close to him, Lin Yun felt a head-splitting headache. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

A long time ago, he was also so close to her. But his memories were sealed up, so he couldn’t recall them. But looking at her right now, his memories began to come back.

Back in the Azure Sky Sect, the initial owner of this body barged in and saw Su Ziyao naked in the icy pool. Her face was pale without any blood and her lips were purple. Back then, the initial owner was terrified, so he ran over to grab Su Ziyao out, giving her warmth with his body.

But he never noticed that as time passed, the initial owner’s lips were also becoming purple. The cold poison was transferred to him without him noticing. When Su Ziyao escaped death and opened her eyes, she saw that he was already dying.

At that time, Su Ziyao looked at the initial owner for a long time before she revealed a smile and made a decision. The scenes then began to blur as the naked bodies became entangled. The poison was slowly being dissolved by their combination. At the same time, the poison could no longer pose any danger to Su Ziyao, so it was only a matter of time before it disappeared.

Coming back to reality, Lin Yun had joy on his face as he coughed. He would throw up a mouthful of blood with every cough, but the joy on his face couldn’t be concealed. At this moment, he had finally recalled everything.

No wonder Su Ziyao threw up blood when he said those words to her back then. So it turns out that Su Ziyao remembered what happened even though he had forgotten. Her memories had always been hidden in the depths of her heart and her aloof appearance was just a facade.

“Ziyao, I recalled…” Lin Yun said with his face blushed.

“And you’re feeling proud about that?” asked Su Ziyao without any expression on her face.

“Well, yeah…” Lin Yun smiled. He wasn’t feeling smug that he possessed Su Ziyao, but she smiled at him in his memory.

“Then you can go down,” said Su Ziyao as she threw Lin Yun out.

“Wait!” exclaimed Lin Yun. He nearly died after taking three palms from the old man, so he would probably be dead if he fell like this.

But a brief moment later, Su Ziyao caught him once more, “Then you’re not allowed to feel proud.”

Lin Yun smiled bitterly, but he felt warmth. At the same time, the old man’s face had turned entirely dark.

“You should leave,” said Su Ziyao.

“Leave? I didn’t agree to that!” The old man came and looked at Lin Yun coldly as a strong killing aura brewed from him.

“You can try,” said Su Ziyao as she glanced at the old man. She then continued to go up the flight of stairs. The old man was facing a dilemma. He ultimately glared at Lin Yun before he turned around.

“This isn’t a bad ending,” said Drifting Goblet as he came over with a jar of wine. “You want some?”

Lin Yun nodded, and he gulped down the wine. When the wine went down his throat, he could feel his injuries being alleviated.

Wiping his mouth, Lin Yun looked at Su Ziyao marching further away from him. Su Ziyao was right in front of him, but at the same time, she was beyond his reach.

“Su Ziyao, even if you stand in the nine heavens, I’ll find you one day. I promise!” yelled Lin Yun.

Su Ziyao paused briefly and then turned around. She glanced at Lin Yun before she continued walking up the stairs.

Drifting Goblet looked at Lin Yun with admiration and said, “She’s the Saintress of the Profound Monarch Palace, the descendant of the true Empress. The Great Qin Empire’s throne is just an opportunity to let her refine the imperial aura to cultivate the Empress Heart Sutra. She’ll stay for as long as one year and as little as six months. It really depends on when her Empress Heart Sutra reaches initial mastery.”

“So what? I slept with her, so I’ll find her no matter where she goes,” said Lin Yun with a smile on his face.

His words made Drifting Goblet stumble as he thought that he had heard it incorrectly. At the same time, the four words ‘I slept with her’ kept echoing within his mind.
