Chapter 2435 - The Radiant Sword Saint Cannot Be Humiliated!

The Azure Python Great Saint manifested into an Azure Dragon with Mu Xuankong standing on it, and his sword ray shone brightly. The density of the energies in the surroundings was visible and began pouring into Mu Xuankong’s body. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

The earth energy wasn’t only from the Sword Sect’s saint vein but the Sword Sect’s accumulation of over a hundred thousand years and the will of the predecessors. When they empowered Mu Xuankong, this allowed him to fight three Great Saints with his cultivation as a Saint Sovereign, and this was a shocking scene.

The Azure Dragon manifested by the Azure Python Great Saint coiled around the Scarlet Firmament Peak, trapping the four Great Saints with his body.

This shocked the four Great Saints before they executed various means, wanting to buy time. But this scene increased the morale of everyone from the Sword Sect.

On the Divine Firmament Peak, Ye Guhan was stationed there. His opponents were two Great Saints from the Ming Cult. The two were strong and reached a high level with the Sun-Moon Saint Canon. Most importantly, one was proficient in the Great Solar Dao while the other was proficient in the Great Lunar Dao, thus having a great rapport.

But facing the two Great Saints, Ye Guhan was fearless. His cultivation might not be comparable, but he had grasped Space Dao, Great Profound Sword Canon, and Profound Sky Canon. He even managed to gain some advantage in his fight against the two Great Saints, but it was a pity he couldn’t shake them off.

Aside from the two Great Saints, two more Great Saints came to the Divine Firmament Peak. They were from Black Mountain and the Heavenly Flame Sect. The one from Black Mountain was called Wither Old Man, and he had a stronger cultivation, long reaching the pinnacle of Great Saint. He grasped Life and Death Daos, making his Wither Blade Art tough to deal with.

His opponent was Lil’ Purple, who barely managed to hold her ground, relying on the Iris Sword Box. Now that Lil’ Purple had gathered four Sovereign Divine Runes, she could easily deal with ordinary Great Saints. But the Great Saint from Black Mountain wasn’t ordinary, and Lil’ Purple’s cultivation wasn’t high.

She hadn’t even become a Saint Sovereign and couldn’t control the Iris Sword Box well. Thus, she could only fend off the incoming attacks and not retaliate. This naturally made Lil’ Purple vexed. She muttered, “It’s a pity I don’t have all seven Sovereign Divine Runes...”

If she managed to gather the seven Sovereign Divine Runes, the Iris Sword Box would be equivalent to a holy land, and it could unleash a terrifying power. It would far surpass the power of a Sovereign saint Artifact. Not even a Divine Artifact could be compared to it then. She now wished Lin Yun was around because the Iris Sword Saint gave the Iris Sword Box to Lin Yun, and he could control it perfectly with his swordsmanship and Nirvana Dao.

As Lil’ Purple fell into deep thoughts, her opponent became impatient because she didn’t stop provocating him.

“Old man, haven’t you eaten? Why are you so weak? I can easily fight ten old men like you when I was younger. Your vitality has already declined at your age, so you must feel terrible that you can’t find your opportunity to enter the Emperor Realm, right? You can only count how many days you have left before you sleep each night. Hehe, why sell yourself to Tian Xuanzi? If you call me Grandpa, I can consider helping you extend your life!”

The Wither Old Man was furious after hearing what Lil’ Purple said, and it was no different from rubbing salt in his wound. But he couldn’t take Lil’ Purple down no matter how he tried even though she wasn’t even a Saint Sovereign. Relying on the Iris Sword Box, Lil’ Purple managed to annoy the Wither Old Man, using martial techniques he hadn’t seen before.

“Damn it! Who the hell are you?!” The Wither Old Man furiously swung his blade. His title was Wither, which wasn’t only a title because he could control the life and death of someone. No one could escape from him unless he wanted them to, even if they became a soul.

“Hehe, listen well! I’m the Divine Phoenix Clan’s Supreme Heavenly Slaughter Empress of Four Seas, Eight Barrens, 36 Heavens, and 72 Earths!” Lil’ Purple smiled, standing on the Iris Sword Box. But before she finished, the Wither Old Man’s face was dark. He did not know if Lil’ Purple was speaking the truth or toying with him.

Even Ye Guhan couldn’t help smiling at this scene as he faced two Great Saints. The two of them were still alright, but Mu Chuan was in trouble, relying on the Divine Firmament Peak’s earth energy to fend off the Profound Flame Great Saint, a Great Saint from the Heavenly Flame Sect.

The Profound Flame Great Saint might not be comparable to the Wither Old Man, but Mu Chuan’s cultivation was even lower than Lil’ Purple’s. They just exchanged ten-odd moves, and he was already injured. He would've lost a long time ago if he didn’t have Lil’ Red helping him. It was just a matter of time before they lost.

Ten moves later, the Profound Flame Great Saint sent Mu Chuan flying away. Mu Chuan powerlessly lied on the ground, vitality leaving his body.

“There’s nothing impressive about the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple. If not for the earth energy, you wouldn’t even leave a corpse behind with your palm,” the Profound Flame Great Saint snorted, looking at Lil’ Red.

Lil’ Red immediately sensed danger and quickly ran, biting onto Mu Chuan’s collar with its mouth.

“It seems that the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple can’t even be compared to a cat,” the Profound Flame Great Saint sneered before looking at Lil’ Purple and Ye Guhan. Whoever he helped would be able to break the stalemate.

“Profound Flame, help me deal with this brat! That sword box is a treasure!” The Wither Old Man roared.

Lil’ Purple and Ye Guhan’s hearts clenched when they heard that.

“He’s not dead yet. I wonder if the Radiant Sword Saint’s heart will be affected if his disciple dies,” the Profound Flame Great Saint laughed, having no intention of letting Mu Chuan go. He charged at Mu Chuan, wanting to kill the latter with one palm.

But a sword ray flew over, accompanied by a vibration that pierced the Profound Flame Great Saint’s palm. This made the Profound Flame Great Saint scream before the sword ray sent him flying away.

The Profound Flame Great Saint took a few steps back before stabilizing himself. His wound was enveloped with sword intent, and he couldn’t heal his injury. This made the Profound Flame Great Saint furious before a young swordsman appeared beside Mu Chuan.

“Jian Jingtian!” Lil’ Purple exclaimed. The young swordsman was the Radiant Sword Saint’s fifth disciple, Jian Jingtian.

Jian Jingtian smiled, “I’m surprised Lord Phoenix still remembers me.”

Now that Jian Jingtian had gotten through the demon in his heart, he had a young appearance, since his actual age was only fifty. Among the Saints, he could be considered a junior.

Ye Guhan heaved a sigh of relief when he saw Jian Jingtian. But before he could greet Jian Jingtian, he exclaimed with his face changing, “Junior Brother, watch out!”

“You dare injure me?” The Profound Flame Great Saint was furious as he charged at Jian Jingtian.

“Senior Brother, you don’t have to worry about me. Just watch how I deal with him, hahaha!” Jian Jingtian laughed as he held his sword in a reverse grip before forming seals with the other hand. As his sword intent continued to rise, it became so bright that even the sun was pale in comparison to it, reaching the pinnacle of Bright Sun Sword Intent.

When Jian Jingtian pushed his palm forth, the Profound Flame Great Saint was sent flying away before he could even respond, and the boundless sword aura made him feel insignificant.

“Damn it!” The Profound Flame Great Saint’s face was ugly as he unleashed his constellation.

But Jian Jingtian wore a smile as he retreated, resolving the Profound Flame Great Saint’s attacks with one hand and never using the other hand.

“Are you humiliating me?!” The Profound Flame Great Saint became furious and unleashed his full power with dao flowers appearing, shrouded in countless saint daos. The powerful aura he gave off made the entire Divine Firmament Peak violently tremble.

“Great Saint? Sorry, but I’m also a Great Saint.” Jian Jingtian raised his brow and unleashed an aura that was not any weaker than the Profound Flame Great Saint.

When the two palms collided, a powerful shockwave swept out. Fortunately, Lil’ Red had taken the Ancient Dracoape form and left with Mu Chuan beforehand, or the shockwave alone would have been able to kill Mu Chuan.

“Fifth Junior Brother!” Mu Chuan teared up on the Ancient Dracoape’s shoulder. He sobbed, “Master, can you see this? The Fifth Junior Brother has come out of it, and he didn’t disappoint you!”

Jian Jingtian once belonged to the Radiant Sword Saint’s lineage and was the pain of everyone in the Sword Sect. He possessed an outstanding talent that made even the Radiant Sword Saint filled with praise for him, not to mention that he comprehended the long-lost sword sutra, becoming the hope of everyone in the Sword Sect.

But Jian Jingtian fell for Tian Jingtian’s trap and was imprisoned in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. So, seeing how Jian Jingtian dealt with the Profound Flame Great Saint with one hand, Mu Chuan had tears rolling down his cheeks. Who could say that the Radiant Sword Saint’s lineage had no one after seeing this?!

“Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple? I’ll kill the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple today!” The Profound Flame Great Saint’s face was cold. He had long accumulated his attack with his other hand.

But just when the Profound Flame Great Saint raised his palm, a sword ray pierced it before stabbing into his shoulder. He was fast, but Jian Jingtian was even faster.

“The Radiant Sword Saint cannot be humiliated!” Jian Jingtian snorted as his sword ray exploded, blowing the Profound Flame Great Saint’s hand into smithereens. This sent the Profound Flame Great Saint flying away, wailing out in pain as blood poured out from his shoulder.
