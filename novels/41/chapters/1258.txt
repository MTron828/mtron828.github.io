Chapter 1259 - Merciless Killing

The woman threw out a mouthful of blood when she was sent flying back and her hair was wildly dishevelled. The palm mark on her face was especially striking. Clearly, Lin Yun didn’t hold back and taught her a lesson because she was simply too noisy.

This scene made everyone’s hearts tremble and more people began to gather together. They already knew that Lin Yun was strong and was only slightly lacking in his cultivation. But from how Lin Yun sent the woman flying with his thunderstorm intent, everyone was breathless with disbelief.

But they were even more shocked by Lin Yun’s arrogance of not placing the Azure Thunder Sect in his eyes.

Taking a slap from Lin Yun, the woman instantly flew into a rage, “Y-You dare to hit me? You bastard, are you trying to incur the wrath of the Azure Thunder Sect or breaking the rapport between the sects?!”

She was vicious and had been trying to push against Lin Yun by using the other sects. Lin Yun could naturally tell what she was planning and replied, “You can think however you like. Just think of it as me breaking the rapport and incurring the wrath of the big sects if you want.”

The so-called “rapport” was a joke, to begin with. If it involved a treasure, the rapport was simply bullshit and everyone would still fight for it. The rapport was only targeted at weaklings.

“Get lost. I don’t wish to see you around.” Lin Yun waved his hand at the woman who struggled to stand up with loathing in his eyes. As a thunderstorm gathered once more, it formed into an azure dragon and sent the woman flying again.

This scene instantly left the audience members dumbfounded and finally understood that Lin Yun had grasped the azure dragon intent, using the azure dragon aura to wield a thunderstorm.

“Thank you for taking revenge for us!”

“The Azure Thunder Sect is too overbearing and didn’t place cultivators from the Profound Azure Prefecture like us in their eyes.” The few who were humiliated by the woman stood up and cupped their hands at Lin Yun with excitement flashing in their eyes.

This made Lin Yun lightly frown his brows. He felt sympathy for them, but he wasn’t standing up for them. He merely followed his own rules of not offending others if he wasn’t offended. The woman was the one who attacked him first. He wasn’t her father nor was he interested in her beauty, so why should he be bothered about her?

“Leave. A matter of this scale isn’t something you people can interfere with,” said Lin Yun.

The cultivators from the Profound Azure Prefecture nodded their heads and looked at Lin Yun’s with respect.

Lin Yun took several steps forth and came to where the Scarlet Blood Fruit was born. Aside from the Scarlet Blood Fruit, there were also other thousand-year-old fruits and herbs that appeared alongside it.

When Lin Yun picked the Scarlet Blood Fruit, he began to examine it. This fruit was truly extraordinary and looked like a ruby that was emitting a dense fragrance. When he held it in his hand, it was beating like a heart and Lin Yun could sense his vitality boiling.

The vitality in the Scarlet Blood Fruit was too strong. While Lin Yun had joy flashing across his pupils, he asked, “Empress, is it really the rainbow light that’s coming out from the crack?”

“How is that possible? The genuine rainbow celestial lights are a lot stronger. I’ve seen the genuine one before, and the genuine one can even cause a divine saint aura to be born in the fruits. I’m guessing that this rainbow light is probably from the Profound Wither Great Saint after his death. The Profound Wither Great Saint is also strong. If he’s placed in ancient times, he would definitely have a great achievement. He probably grasped the life intent and this is why his saint aura after his death can be compared to a rainbow celestial light,” said Lil’ Purple.

“Life intent?”

“Martial intent consisting of life. But it’s not complete because real life also needs death. Life is only complete with death. Life intent is also the same as life-death dao. It is the same behind the life-death divine rune in the sword box. This Profound Wither Great Saint was strong when he’s alive, and this means that the island will also be extraordinary,” explained Lil’ Purple.

Lin Yun was shocked to hear that one needed to grasp life and death for a complete life. Just the incomplete life intent from the Profound Wither Great Saint after his death alone was equivalently comparable to rainbow celestial light. Lin Yun couldn’t imagine how strong those saint herbs in the Profound Wither Island would be. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Holding onto the Scarlet Blood Fruit, Lin Yun turned his head to look at the Profound Wither Island enveloped in a thunderstorm with anticipation in his eyes.

Right at this moment, Lil’ Purple’s voice resounded, “Lin Yun, watch out!”

A sword aura was directed at him. When Lin Yun turned his head over, it was the woman who tried to launch a sneak attack when he was distracted. Furthermore, she even summoned her constellation with a painting unfolding behind her. The painting was a sword enveloped in crimson flames, and most swordsmen would also use various types of saint swords as their constellation.

Not only was it simple to form, but it was also a perfect match for swordsmen. Her painting also had a moon hanging high in the sky formed with thunder and fire. This made the painting and the intent within it even more unfathomable.

This was the foundation of a big sect, and it could be seen from their constellation. This attack from her was extremely vicious and aimed at Lin Yun’s head. But Lin Yun didn’t panic and merely tilted his body to dodge this attack. Even so, the wind of that attack left a faint cut on his face.

“Is that all you got? You’re ultimately just a piece of trash in the Galaxy Stage. You can go and die now!” The woman said with disdain in her eyes. She didn’t panic after seeing that her attack failed. As the sword in her hand began to light up, various saint runes began to emit a dazzling light.

Her sword wasn’t ordinary and had over seven hundred saint runes. If it was someone else, they would definitely be immobilized by the aura of the saint runes at such a close distance, and even Lin Yun could feel that his movements were being restricted if he didn’t use his divine firmament sword intent.

Her sword was fast and streaked across Lin Yun’s neck, wanting to decapitate him. When she saw blood on Lin Yun’s neck, the woman smiled. But her smile soon froze because the wound on Lin Yun’s neck didn’t expand and was only a faint mark.

Her attack was strong, but Lin Yun was even faster. This instantly made the woman panic because no one had managed to dodge her attack at such a close distance before, “This is impossible!”

“Go and die!” The woman went insane and thrust her sword at Lin Yun’s forehead. But Lin Yun had already calmed down after the sneak attack and merely used two fingers to catch her sword.

“Let go! I-If you kill me, not only will you die, but your sect will also be in trouble!” The woman was terrified when she couldn’t even budge her sword no matter how she tried. Just a moment ago, she was arrogantly thinking that Lin Yun would die. But just a second later, she had already panicked and even used Lin Yun’s sect as a threat.

Her words made Lin Yun’s eyes cold as he snorted, unleashing his azure dragon aura. In the next second, his surroundings were enveloped with light with a draconic roar spreading out, followed by the wailing of the woman’s sword. Everyone watched as cracks spread across the saint sword before it broke apart.

This made the woman throw out a mouthful of blood and her constellation also blew apart. When the audience saw this scene, they were terrified and their faces became pale. After all, for a person as young as Lin Yun to destroy a saint sword was simply unheard of.

“Just who the hell is he?”

“It makes no sense that none of us have heard of his name when he has such strength!”

“Can he be a genius outside of the Ancient Barren Domain?” Questions arose in everyone’s hearts as they looked at Lin Yun.

The woman fell to the ground and screamed out in pain, Lin Yun didn’t hold back. When she landed on the ground, he waved his hand several more times and thunderstorms appeared, looking as if they wanted to tear the sky apart.

The woman did whatever she could, but she couldn’t fend off Lin Yun’s attacks at all. It didn’t take long for her to be covered in blood and she no longer had the arrogant look from before.

“Stop! If you kill me, not only your sect but everyone you hold concern about will also die!” The woman yelled and was really afraid this time. At this moment, she couldn’t even describe her fear with words because she had never felt so close to death.

But her words raised Lin Yun’s killing intent. He hated people threatening him with those around him the most. Without any hesitation, Lin Yun summoned the Flower Burial Sword and unleashed a radiant sword ray.

The scene froze with the woman staring with her eyes wide open as a drop of blood rolled down her forehead.

“What a fast sword aimed at the forehead!”

“I couldn’t even see it clearly. His attainment in the sword is actually so strong!”

“This young man is a little terrifying.” The audience members exclaimed because they didn’t even see how Lin Yun attacked. When their sights returned to them, Lin Yun had already sheathed his sword.

Right at this moment, something happened. A cut appeared on the woman’s forehead and extended down before her corpse fell into two. This scene made everyone hold their mouths because this was simply terrifying.

After a long time, they began to exclaim, “Holy shit, a core disciple of the Azure Thunder Sect was killed!”
