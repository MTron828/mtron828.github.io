Chapter 717 - Come Up and Fight Me!

When the rose on the sword tip bloomed, it revealed a bewitching luster and boundless sword rays. Under the rose, Gu Yang’s martial soul shattered and blood leaked out of his lips.

Shortly after, the sword rays rippled out and pushed Gu Yang and the Gu Clan’s elders back. With that, there was no one around the Demonification Fruit. But Lin Yun knew that this wouldn’t last long as they would swiftly gather together.

With a clear objective, Lin Yun executed the Seven Profound Steps and shuttled past everyone. Pushing his sword intent to the limit, he resisted the Demonification Fruit’s aura as he gradually approached.

The Demonification Fruit seemed to have sensed the danger as astral energy manifested into wind blades that hit Lin Yun’s body. In the blink of an eye, there were several wounds on Lin Yun’s body. But even so, there was no change to his face. His eyes radiated with obsession as nothing would stop him. Neither the seven geniuses nor the wind blades could deter him from the Demonification Fruit.

With that obsession, Lin Yun endured the crimson storm head-on and grabbed the Demonification Fruit. The Demonification Fruit felt like magma when he held it in his hand. Boundless energy leaked out of the fruit and left wounds on Lin Yun’s palm. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Behave!” Lin Yun roared as he unleashed his aura and suppressed the Demonification Fruit.

Behind him, Gu Yang was briefly stunned before he collected himself. Then, a cold light flashed in his eyes. He raged as he stabbed Lin Yun with his martial soul, “Leave that fruit behind!”

“You’re courting death!” The Gu Clan’s elders also collected themselves as they charged over.

Sheathing the Flower Burial Sword, Lin Yun stored the Demonification Fruit and pushed the Seven Profound Steps to the limit as his origin energy manifested into a pair of wings behind him.

Gu Yang’s attack managed to land on him, but just when the Gu Clan’s elders’ attacks were about to land on him as well, Lin Yun finally finished executing the Seven Profound Steps and soared into the sky. He was covered in blood, but this was the price he paid to obtain the Demonification Fruit.

“This is…”

“Is he trying to ascend the clouds?” Gu Yang and the rest were dumbfounded as they looked at Lin Yun soaring into the sky.

Right at this moment, three figures shrouded in torrential killing aura arrived. They were naturally Qin Xu and the Jin brothers. After Qin Xu landed on the ground, he asked, “Where’s the sword slave?”

“Can’t you see for yourself?” asked Gu Yang.

Qin Xu raised his head and saw Lin Yun bearing the pressure heading upwards. His face couldn’t help changing as he asked, “Is he courting death? The Demonification Fruit there is already claimed by Chen Ziyu and Chu Muyan…”

“Did he snatched this segment’s Demonification Fruit as well?” The Jin brothers suddenly asked.

The faces of the Gu Clan’s elders sank as they looked at the two brothers. But the two brothers weren’t bothered by them as they wore mocking smiles. After all, this was a Demonification Fruit with eight strands of aura.

Just when the Gu Clan’s elders were about to flare up, Gu Yang’s voice sounded out, “He has gone up.”

Everyone raised their heads and saw a huge hole in the crimson clouds. When they recovered from their shock, they chased after Lin Yun, “Get him!”

In addition to Qing Ruoyou’s grudge, the seven geniuses now had another reason to fight Lin Yun. There was no way they would let him go after he snatched two Demonification Fruits from them.

Passing through the branches and leaves, Lin Yun pierced through the crimson clouds. When he landed on the ground, he started gasping for air. He could see a Demonification Fruit shrouded in nine wisps of aura at the treetop.

This was the most precious Demonification Fruit and also the most dangerous one. Someone tried to seize it earlier, but they were killed before they even got close. This was why this place became a forbidden zone in many people’s eyes.

Even Chu Muyan and Chen Ziyu didn’t dare to approach it after watching so many demonic cultivator’s deaths. But Lin Yun actually went up under so many gazes.

Not long later, Gu Yang, Qin Xu, Jin Zhan, Jin Yi, and the other wandering cultivators gathered next to Chu Muyan and Chen Ziyu. This was the highest place beneath the clouds and they only had to leap up to pass through the crimson clouds. But the pressure here was immense.

The tree branch they were standing on suddenly emitted a creaking noise as if it would snap at any time.

“That brat is really courting death,” said Chen Ziyu coldly. He and Chu Muyan had witnessed how terrifying it was above the clouds. Several demonic cultivators wanted to soar up, but all of them died a baffling death as their skeletons rained down. This was why they didn’t dare to take the risk.

They didn’t know where Lin Yun got the confidence to go up. They were less than a hundred meters away from Lin Yun, with only a layer of crimson clouds separating them. Due to the thin clouds, they could clearly see everything.

“Lin Yun, handed over the Demonification Fruits and the Divine Indigo Radiantstone. You’re cornered!” Chu Muyan roared as his hair began to flutter under the wind that his spear was creating. It felt as though his spear could pierce through the sky.

Chen Muyan was using the Stundragon Spear, a transcendent cosmic artifact that the Skycloud Sect forged with all they had. There were a total of three such spears, one was with the Sect Master, one was with the Grand Elder, and the last one was with Chu Muyan.

“Lin Yun, handed over the Demonification Fruits and the Divine Indigo Radiantstone. I can resolve your relationship with Her Highness Ruoyou,” said Chen Ziyu as he took a huge step back. That was because he didn’t have a choice. The region above the crimson clouds was a forbidden zone and he didn’t want to take the risk of fighting Lin Yun up there.

Everyone began to spread out as they sealed off Lin Yun’s retreat. At that moment, all the geniuses and demonic cultivators surrounded Lin Yun. This place was narrow and many people had died before Lin Yun had arrived. So if he dared to take a step forward, he would die just like those demonic cultivators.

But if he dared to come down, he would be instantly surrounded by the seven geniuses and the demonic cultivators because everyone knew Lin Yun had two Demonification Fruits. No matter how they looked at this situation, Lin Yun could only comply with Chu Muyan and the rest to live.

“He’s just a mere sword slave. Why the trouble?” Jin Yi, who was heavily injured by Lin Yun’s palm, wore a sinister expression as he could barely contain his rage. He wanted to go up and slaughter Lin Yun.

But just when he moved, he felt a cold gaze from Chen Ziyu. Chen Ziyu’s gaze was so cold that Jin Yi’s spine shivered.

“You’re courting death. If we can’t fight on top, do you think you’re in any position to do it? Chu Muyan and I would’ve slaughtered him already. I don’t care if you go up and die, but if you ruin the Demonification Fruit, the Jin Clan won’t be able to bear the consequences!” Chen Ziyu looked at Jin Yi coldly, “Try and bluff him to come down before moving.”

At that moment, Jin Yi could feel a terrifying chill down his spine. He was shocked by Chen Ziyu’s schemes and strength. Chen Ziyu made a promise in his name earlier, but no one had thought that he had thrown it to the back of his mind in the next second. Even he was nearly fooled by Chen Ziyu.

“Lin Yun…” Everyone beneath the Demonification Tree looked up with shock on their faces, especially Guo Xu and Yang Fan. Not only did Lin Yun seize two Demonification Fruits, but he even soared past the crimson clouds and stood in confrontation with the seven geniuses and many demonic cultivators.

“Why the trouble? The Demonification Fruits, Divine Indigo Radiantstone, and my life are right here. If you want them, come up and fight me!” Lin Yun’s mocking voice echoed out and was heard by everyone. This made everyone raise their heads because they all recognized the voice. As usual, Lin Yun took such a strong stance.
