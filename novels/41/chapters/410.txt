Chapter 411 - Mediator

The crimson bird soared into the sky and enveloped every corner of the capital.

“That’s the Divine Guards’ Profound Bird Seal!”

“What’s going on? Is there a beast tide? Did someone rebel against the empire?”

The Profound Bird Seal was hardly used and the moment it appeared, it would represent that the empire was in a dangerous situation. At the same time, only the Divine Guards’ commander was permitted to use this seal. But it had been a few hundred years since this seal was last seen. The last time it appeared, the empire was facing a demonic beast riot that engulfed the capital.

Everyone in the capital began to feel uneasy. As for those who knew the truth, they felt even more uneasy. Four Guardians and seven Sword-Bearing Elders. If they were to rebel in the capital, the consequence would be even more dire than a demonic beast tide. Especially when the sword, Light Containment, was more terrifying than anyone had imagined.

“Protect His Highness!” Liu Feilong got on horseback and defended the carriage as he looked at Guardian Plum approaching with Light Containment in his hand. Even the guards who were initially responsible for ensuring Qin Yu’s safety never expected that they would have to face the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s four Guardians, especially Guardian Plum who wielded Light Containment.

The Sword Firmament Pavilion was completely capable of capturing the crown prince before the Divine Guards and the royal family’s experts arrived. For a moment, the atmosphere became intense. Both sides had completely fallen out with each other, so it would be a bloodbath the moment they started fighting.

This also meant that countless cultivators would die from the bloodbath. Regardless of if it was the Sword Firmament Pavilion or the royal family, neither of them would become the winner.

Although Qin Yu had maintained his composure, he was swept with shock in his heart because he never expected that the situation would come to this. This wasn’t the outcome that he wanted. There was no benefit in going head to head with the Sword Firmament Pavilion. Everything that he did so far was to forcefully marry Xin Yan, including killing Xin Jue.

He tried to make it so that the Sword Firmament Pavilion wouldn’t have an excuse to take action, but his plan had been ruined by Lin Yun. He now regretted not killing Lin Yun the moment he appeared. He had been cautious all along, but the situation still developed in the direction that he didn’t wish to see.

Right at this moment, the intense atmosphere was disrupted by a sudden intrusion of chimes. When everyone looked at the direction that the chimes were coming from, they saw a large group coming earlier than the Divine Guards.

It was a luxurious formation with eighteen people carrying a jade white carriage. Inside the carriage sat a veiled lady. It was a formation of a thousand people in the front and three thousand people in the back.

“It’s the princess!”

“That’s Bloomphoenix Princess. What is she doing here…” Aside from the princess of the empire, no one else had such a luxurious formation. She might be veiled, but everyone could recognize her eyes. Furthermore, the princess also had a unique temperament that would leave a deep impression on anyone.

The mysterious masked man beside Lin Yun also felt relieved when he saw the Bloomphoenix Princess’ arrival. He knew that the princess must have convinced that person in the imperial palace.

Qin Yu, who had decided to stake everything into this, frowned his eyebrows when he saw the princess’ arrival. At the same time, an ill premonition grew in his heart.

“Liu Feilong, back down with your men,” instructed the Bloomphoenix Princess on the carriage.

“You’re not allowed to back down!” barked Qin Yu.

“Qin Yu, are you going against our royal father’s decree?” asked the Bloomphoenix Princess indifferently.

“Decree? I naturally won’t disobey the royal father’s decree, but who knows if you’re faking his decree?” Qin Yu replied without any change in his expression.

“What a fool. You’ve only seen the Divine Guards moving out. Have you seen any traces of the imperial palace’s experts? Without the royal father’s decree, those experts would’ve already come to you long ago,” said the princess in a disdainful tone.

Liu Feilong fell into deep thought before he formed seals with a hand and dissipated the crimson bird that enveloped the entire capital. When the signal disappeared, the elites of the Divine Guards who were rushing here also returned to their respective stations.

When Guardian Plum saw how the situation was developing, he sheathed Light Containment. From that action, everyone could tell that both parties had no intention of fighting for real because the consequences weren’t something that either side could bear.

In the end, a battle that would have destroyed half the capital was dissolved by the princess’ words, which made many people feel relieved. After all, who knew how great the loss would be if a war really took place. Everyone would be implicated by the war.

Seated inside the carriage, Qin Yu’s eyes flashed with a hint of fury. This was no longer a simple case of being embarrassed. He was furious because he was now being suppressed by the princess.

Looking at Qin Yu from high above, Bloomphoenix Princess barked with an unquestionable tone, “Release Xin Yan.”

“Haha, aren’t you overstepping your boundaries here? Don’t tell me that this is also our royal father’s decree?” Qin Yu’s eyes flashed with killing intent. This was his bottomline and he would never let anyone cross it. There was no way he could back down from this marriage, even if it was a decree from his father.

“You know well what kind of tricks you played behind the scenes. I’m trying to save you from embarrassment here. Otherwise, don’t blame me for embarrassing you,” replied the princess coldly.

“There’s really a story behind the marriage?”

“I knew it. How would Xin Yan marry him willingly?”

“I’m afraid that there’s a secret why His Highness isn’t willing to back down even when the situation came to this.”

The controversy tilted towards the princess and Lin Yun instantly.

“If there’s really a story behind this, then please make things clear today and give the Sword firmament Pavilion an explanation!” Guardian Plum’s voice sounded out behind Lin Yun.

“Make things clear? It was something that she agreed to personally. I’m giving you the greatest leeway by letting Lin Yun go. Don’t think that I’m afraid of the Sword Firmament Pavilion even without the Divine Guards,” replied Qin Yu.

“Then I’m sorry, but you can’t touch Lin Yun or Xin Yan then!” Guardian Plum already made his decision since even Lin Yun dared to stand up for Xin Yan. He had already drawn his sword, so he would never back down without achieving his goal.

“Qin Yu, let me give you some advice. You’re still not the emperor, so you’re in no position to say anything in the empire. You’ve already caused a huge mess today, so if you insist on going on, I can tell you honestly that you can give up on participating in the Dragon Gate Competition,” said the Bloomphoenix Princess. She was giving Qin Yu her final warning.

Qin Yu’s eyes suddenly became sharp as he stared at the slender figure seated in the jade carriage. That slender figure seemed to be out of this world with a unique temperament.

The two of them had trump cards from beyond the empire, but Qin Yu hadn’t been able to guess Bloomphoenix Princess’ trump card. He believed without a doubt that the Bloomphoenix Princess was capable of preventing him from participating in the Dragon Gate Competition.

He didn’t fear her, but he didn’t want to take the risk. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Since it’s a matter between swordsmen, then let’s resolve it with swords.” Bai Lixuan suddenly spoke out with annoyance in his eyes. He dismounted his horse and looked at Lin Yun, “Lin Yun, you can take Xin Yan away if you’re able to take an attack from me and remain standing. Only one absolute genius is needed in the sect. That absolute genius is me, Bai Lixuan. Do you dare to take an attack from me?”
