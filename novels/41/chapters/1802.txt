Chapter 1803 - Vicious Rumors

Him again?! Lin Yun’s pupils flashed with a hint of loathing under the bamboo hat because this person was a little too friendly. Placing the cup down, he asked, “Don’t you have anything better to do? What is it? You can just be direct about it.”

He wasn’t acquainted with Mei Zihua to the point that they could be so casual. This was the third time Mei Zihua showed up, so he must have had a scheme of some sort.

Mei Zihua squeezed out a smile, but wasn’t too bothered about it. He asked, “Have you seen the Vermilion Bird’s jade slip I gave you?”

“I did.” Lin Yun said, brushing it away. How could he possibly have the time to take a look at that? He wasn’t too interested in music dao. The reason why he learned music dao was to conceal his identity and enter the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion.

“What do you think about it?” Mei Zihua laughed with a smug face.Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Not bad.” Lin Yun replied.

“Thanks for your compliment.” Mei Zihua smiled confidently. “Since that’s the case, why don’t you come with me? I have a lot more Vermilion Bird jade slips at home. I wonder if you’re interested?”

“To where?” Lin Yun asked in a surprised tone.

“The Divine Dragon Empire, Mei Clan.” Mei Zihua said seriously.

“Mei Zihua, just tell me what you want. I have already agreed to almost all your requests, haven’t I? I loaned you the spike fiddle and even gave you the scores for it. Don’t tell me you’re after the Three-Lives Fruit or…” Lin Yun placed the cup down, and his facial expression became vigilant. He was wondering if Mei Zihua had seen through his identity.

“The Three-Lives Fruit? It’s true I’m a little interested in it.” Mei Zihua smiled.

“What if I don’t agree to come with you?” Lin Yun asked.

“Then, I’m afraid I can only think of other ways…” Mei Zihua said confidently.

He was very sure that Mei Zihua was only at the Dragon Pulse Realm. With a baffled look, Lin Yun said, “You’re present at the Martial Dao Tea Party, so you should know my strength. I’m first on the Dragon Pulse Ranking.”

“First on the Dragon Pulse Ranking only proves you’re invincible in the Eastern Desolation, not the Kunlun Realm.” Mei Zihua smiled.

“Why don’t you give it a try, then?” Lin Yun said indifferently.

Mei Zihua simply smiled and gently placed his cup on the table. The wine in the cup fluctuated, and the tavern instantly became quiet.

Looking through the bamboo hat, Lin Yun could sense an invisible soundwave spread out from the wine that isolated them from the outside world.

“Great Saint Tune!” Lin Yun raised his head to look at Mei Zihua. He asked, “Since you possess the Great Saint Tune, why didn’t you use it at the Nirvana Banquet?”

Opening up his fan, Mei Zihua smiled, “I’m the descendant of one of the Ten Musical Clans, and I have my pride. If I have to rely on the Great Saint Tune to defeat you, then I have already lost the fight.”

“So, you’re not after the Three-Lives Fruit?” Lin Yun asked. He couldn’t tell what Mei Zihua was planning now.

“Of course not. I only want to invite you to the Mei Clan in the Divine Dragon Empire.” Mei Zihua said with flames blazing within his pupils.

“So, you already know of my identity?” Lin Yun asked.

“Your identity? Of course, I do…” Mei Zihua smiled. Wasn’t Lin Xiao a disciple of the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain? He already discovered it long ago.

But before he could finish, Lin Yun gently tapped his finger on the table, causing the cup to shatter. As the surrounding noise returned to normal, Lin Yun’s face changed under the bamboo hat because he was sure Mei Zihua didn’t have any killing intent against him. He wasn’t sure if Mei Zihua shared it with anyone else. Most importantly, how did Mei Zihua find out about his true identity when even a saint couldn’t see through his disguise? Could it be a powerful artifact of the Mei Clan?

“Let me tell you, Lin Xiao is Flower Burial Lin Yun. This is what the Wind Edge Lord said at the Martial Dao Tea Party.” Right then, a radiant voice resounded from the tavern, instantly captivating everyone’s attention.

“Are you serious? Isn’t this news too explosive? Did the Wind Edge Lord really say that?”

“The Wind Edge Lord seems to have said that, but he was soon refuted by someone else. Not to mention Lin Xiao even taught him a lesson and the Autumn Mountain Lord apologized to Lin Xiao on his behalf.” Someone responded immediately.

The blue-robed youth who spoke initially smiled, “If Lin Xiao isn’t guilty, why does he have to injure the Wind Edge Lord? None of you thought about that before?”

“It does make sense if you put it that way.”

“But even the Dragon Pulse Ranking’s dragon spirit acknowledged him as Lin Xiao, and the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s Heavenly Origin Mirror couldn’t see anything…”

Seeing that someone responded to him, the blue-robed youth smiled, “The dragon spirit is only an artifact spirit. Who knows if it's fooled? As for the Heavenly Origin Mirror, don’t tell me you guys don’t know that there’s an adulterous relationship between Lin Xiao and the Saint Elder?”

“Are you serious about that? I thought there was a relationship between Lin Xiao and the Profound Fairy. What’s going on?” The atmosphere within the tavern became heated when they heard about a gossip between Lin Xiao and Saint Elder, and they quickly gathered.

After all, who wasn’t interested in gossip? Not to mention Mu Xueling was a famous ice beauty within Heavenly Domain City. So everyone’s blood naturally began to boil when they heard there was gossip between Mu Xueling and Lin Xiao.

“Hahaha! I bet you don’t know about that.” The blue-robed youth was satisfied when he saw the surrounding reactions. He smiled, “Back at the West Garden Banquet, Mu Xueling came to save Lin Yun with the Imperial Dragon Order. You guys weren’t around, so you don’t know how nervous Mu Xueling was and how gentle her gaze was when she looked at Lin Yun.”

“Holy shit! This piece of news is too explosive!”

“Lin Xiao, that damn bastard is really lucky to have two beauties.” An exclamation resounded from the surrounding area, but everyone was envious.

The blue-robed youth smiled, “Hehe. No beauties can resist the charm of a hero, not to mention Lin Xiao is Flower Burial, a peerless genius in the sword.”

Everyone practically went insane, and this explosive piece of information caused an uproar.

“Don’t bother being envious of him. He’s Flower Burial. Without him defeating the two God Generals, the Martial Dao Tea Party wouldn’t have been able to continue to go on.” The blue-clothed youth didn’t forget to link Lin Xiao with Lin Yun. He continued with a smile, “At the Martial Dao Tea Party, Lin Yun is really arrogant, saying that the Blood Moon Sect is a bunch of garbage with their strength.”

In the corner, Mei Zihua was briefly shocked before he turned to look at Lin Yun, “Brother Lin, no wonder you’re not interested in my nine maids.”

“You believe it?” Lin Yun asked.

“Hehe, gossip doesn’t start without a reason. Not to mention we’re both men, so I can understand you.” Mei Zihua gave Lin Yun a wink. This sort of rumor was lethal, containing half-truths and half-lies, mixed with a hint of love gossip. Once it spreads, no one would be concerned about what the truth was.

“I’m just talking about it casually, and we can’t imagine this feeling. Just imagine the sleeping Profound Fairy and the gorgeous Saint Elder… Hehehe!” The blue-robed youth got even more exaggerated with what he said, detonating the atmosphere in the tavern.

When he saw the crowd being excited, the corner of his lips curled up and the effects were better than he imagined.

Right then, he could sense a huge danger as a bamboo hat flew over, hitting his chest and making him throw out a mouthful of blood with his face pale.

Before he could even react, a person already appeared before him with a sword pointed at his forehead. This instantly made him terrified because it was Lin Xiao. The person standing at the wine table looking at him was Lin Xiao.

The surroundings immediately became quiet because they didn’t expect they would run into Lin Xiao here.

“Who instructed you to spread those rumors?” Lin Yun asked coldly.

The blue-robed youth tried his best to maintain his composure, and he sneered, “What? You’re feeling guilty now? Flower Burial, how almighty!”

“Not going to say it?” Lin Yun repeated.

The blue-robed youth smiled, “Go ahead and kill me, if you have the guts. If you kill me, you’re feeling guilty. Everyone, Flower Burial is trying to silence me!”

But Lin Yun couldn’t be bothered to waste time with him and pierced his heart with his sword. He questioned coldly, “Last chance. Are you still not going to say it?”

The blue-robed youth was instantly enveloped in fear, but he still gritted his teeth, “Kill me, then! I won’t say anything even if you kill me!”

“Good. As you wish!” Lin Yun said before wanting to pull his sword out.

But halfway through, the blue-robed youth finally panicked, and he murmured, “Don’t kill me! I’ll talk!”

“Who is it?” Lin Yun asked.

“The Wind Edge Lord!” The blue-robed youth briefly struggled, before he continued, “The Wind Edge Lord asked us to spread the rumors, regardless if it’s true. At that time, those coveting the Firmament Saint Cloth will come after you, and he even asked us to provoke you and the Blood Moon Sect, using the Blood Moon Sect to deal with you!”

An uproar broke out from the surroundings because no one expected the Wind Edge Lord to be so vicious. The rumors were lethal. When Lin Yun heard that, a murderous aura rose within his pupils because the Wind Edge Lord really got on his nerves.

“He says you’ll surely go to the Black Tortoise Void Sea, and he has a hundred ways to kill you at that time!” The blue-robed youth then begged for mercy, “Spare my life. You’re first on the Dragon Pulse Ranking, so you can’t go back on your words. I have said everything I know, so you can’t kill me!”

He was feeling aggrieved because he never expected he would run into Lin Yun, so he completely panicked.

“It’s true I am a man of my word, but I don’t remember saying that I won’t take your life.” Lin Yun drew the sword out indifferently. As blood splashed out, the blue-robed youth’s heart shattered.

Sheathing his sword, Lin Yun swept his gaze around before coldly saying, “I know his accomplices among you. Go back and tell this to the Wind Edge Lord, ‘Come to the Black Tortoise Void Sea personally if you wants my life. Otherwise, you will never be able to find me.’”

When Lin Yun finished, he left the tavern with Mei Zihua closely following behind. Mei Zihua said, “That Wind Edge Lord is really vicious to spread rumors about you being Flower Burial.”

Hearing that, Lin Yun turned around and asked, “Don’t you already know my identity?”

“Of course. You’re clearly a disciple of the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain, and I won’t be wrong.” Mei Zihua said confidently.

Lin Yun gave Mei Zihua a strange look before he said, “You don’t have to follow me. I won’t be going to the Divine Dragon Empire anytime soon, but I will go there in the future. I’ll contact you again if there’s a chance. So don’t follow me!”

Before Mei Zihua could say a word, Lin Yun already turned around and left, leaving behind the depressed Mei Zihua.
