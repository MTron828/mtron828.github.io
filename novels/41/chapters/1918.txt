Chapter 1919 - Life Intent

Zhang Qiao’s face became pale after being pointed at by Ye Qingtian’s sword, and he didn’t even dare to take a bigger breath. But his pupils were filled with flames, and he clearly wasn’t convinced by the result. “Ye Qingtian, do you dare to compete with me again?”

“This is an older generation saint disciple? I don’t have the time and mood to play around with you, so get lost!” Lin Yun sheathed his sword and turned around to leave. He didn’t even take another bat at Zhang Qiao.

“Ye Qingtian, I haven’t lost yet!” Zhang Qiao was briefly stunned before he started to laugh after seeing Ye Qingtian leave. When he said that, he summoned his constellation. It was an ancient three of a few dozen feet. The ancient tree was enveloped in a death aura, and Zhang Qiao circulated the nirvana aura within his body.

In a split second, the aura of the second transformation of the Nirvana Stage and his constellation’s aura swept out. Zhang Qiao was completely different from before, and his saint blade flew over with a wave of his hand.

“Drop dead!” Zhang Qiao soared to the sky and swung his blade down, fully displaying the essence of the Witherwood Blade Art, and his sword was enveloped with a terrifying nether aura.

This made everyone’s faces change. Logically speaking, Zhang Qiao had already lost when Lin Yun’s sword was pointed against his forehead, but Zhang Qiao refused to admit defeat and even launched a sneak attack.

On the other hand, Zhang Qiao felt that he only lost because he was careless. After all, he didn’t even accumulate all the nirvana aura within his body, summon his constellation, nor display the full prowess of the Witherwood Blade Art. He was confident that he could win if he brought them out.

This scene stunned everyone, but Zhang Yue and Ye Feifan rejoiced when they saw it.

But when his blade descended, Lin Yun merely used two fingers to clamp onto the blade, and the death aura on the blade was absorbed into his body.

“How is this possible?!” Zhang Qiao’s face changed. Not only the death aura on the blade, but the ancient tree within his constellation was also withering. Just when he was feeling uncertain, a Netherflower bloomed beneath Ye Qingtian.

When seventy-two petals opened up, Zhang Qiao’s constellation split into pieces and he threw out a mouthful of blood before being sent flying away. But his blade was still being clamped between Ye Qingtian’s two fingers.

“Boring!” Lin Yun waved his hand, and the saint blade flew back, piercing Zhang Qiao’s chest and pinning him on the stage.

The surroundings fell into a brief silence before an uproar broke out.

“That fellow is really dashing!”

“Cocky, callous, and heartless!”

“To lose even when he launched a sneak attack, Zhang Qiao might as well just commit suicide.”

“It’s no wonder why Ye Qingtian can draw the attention of the two holy maidens. Which woman wouldn’t like such a powerful man?”

“Hehe. Senior Brother Ye is pretty dashing.” Not only did the inner disciples break into an uproar, but the female disciples also looked at Ye Qingtian with their pupils shining brightly. In their eyes, Ye Qingtian had really changed, and he was an entirely different person.

On the Heavenly Dao Altar, the Dragon Origin Great Saint said, “The Heavenly Aquatic Peak is one of the nine upper peaks. Why is their disciple so shameless? The Peak Master should change now since he’s not doing a good job!”

The other Saint Elders didn’t dare to utter a word, but they all transmitted their voices to their disciples to not learn from Zhang Qiao. If Ye Qingtian was really injured today, Zhang Qiao and the entire Heavenly Aquatic Peak would be doomed. Anyone could tell that the Dragon Origin Great Saint was genuinely furious; no one could imagine how terrifying it would be if a Great Saint became furious.

Zhang Yue and Ye Feifan’s faces became ugly when they saw Zhang Qiao being defeated.Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Lin Yun had been paying close attention to the battles that happened before. He could trounce Zhang Qiao because he had already witnessed the Witherwood Blade Art from other stages. Zhang Qiao wasn’t the only one who practiced this blade technique, so he had already analyzed it within his mind a few hundred times.

Constellation… I must think about which constellation to use within the Heavenly Dao Sect… Lin Yun inwardly muttered as he observed the surrounding battles. No one would summon their constellation if it was an ordinary battle between ordinary disciples, but the competition was different because there weren’t any restrictions.

“Nether Orchid Courtyard, Wang Yue!”

“Profound Maiden Courtyard, Su Zhen!” The fight between two disciples in the Gold category instantly attracted Lin Yun’s attention because his next opponent would be one of the two. The two palaces and three courtyards were ranked ahead of the hundred and eight peaks, and their disciples were generally a tad stronger than others.

Su Zhen was a disciple of the Profound Maiden Courtyard and was over fifty years old. She mainly focused on a Buddhist sword technique, a high-grade ghost spirit martial technique named the Void Fog Sword.

“Voiding Fog!” A high-grade ghost spirit martial technique was powerful, and a Buddhist radiance accompanied her sword. This basked the entire mountain in a golden holy light, and she wasn’t an exception either, as she looked solemn.

But her sword technique was domineering, sealing off Wang Yue’s path of retreat. When she swung her sword, hundreds of golden rays manifested into sword rays that flew out.

On the other hand, Wang Yue faced her attacks head-on, swiftly exchanging over ten-odd moves.

“Void Rain!” Su Zhen soared to the sky as her constellation merged with her, and she turned into a Bodhisattva in mid-air. Densely packed sword rays descended like the rain when she swung her sword. Each droplet easily created a hole on the stage, and one must know that even a Quasi-Saint would have some difficulties causing damage to the stage.

“The Profound Maiden Courtyard’s sword techniques are really domineering. She might be a woman but she’s more domineering than a man when she fights.”

“Sword techniques combined with Buddhism. I can’t imagine this sword technique's power without facing it myself.” The surrounding saint disciples exclaimed at Su Zhen’s attacks.

When even Lin Yun felt that the Nether Orchid Courtyard’s Wang Yue would lose, the latter executed a secret technique. This was the Nether Orchid Sword that everyone at the Nether Orchid Courtyard knew of, and she swung her sword out.

This forced Su Zhen’s attacks back, immediately making her panic. At the same time, Nether Orchids appeared on the stage, and they became even more gorgeous under the nourishment of sword rays.

“Since ancient times, every flower blooms!” Su Zhen raised her sword before her chest and swiped on the sword’s body with her left hand, causing countless Nether Orchids to soar to the sky.

“Life Intent?” Lin Yun was surprised, and couldn’t help taking a better look at Wang Yue. He was surprised that the latter grasped the Life Intent, which was much more challenging than Death Intent. If Wang Yue could also grasp the Death Intent, he could have attempted to grasp the supreme Life-Death Intent. The Life-Death Intent was a supreme martial intent comparable to Time-Space Intent.

Without question, the table was turned around after Wang Yue executed the Life Intent, and Su Zhen admitted defeat after ten moves.

“The Nether Orchid Courtyard gave birth to another genius.” Su Zhen bowed.

“I’m far from being comparable to Senior Sister Bai,” Wang Yue cupped his hands together, looking humble.

More intense battles appeared from the Di Group, and the intensity was a lot tougher than everyone else.

“It’s no wonder why the ordinary Nether Orchid Sword can have such a terrifying power, he has grasped the Life Intent.”

“Wang Yue is normally pretty low-profiled. He’s a clansman of the Wang Clan, right?”

Lin Yun felt that Wang Yue would be a formidable opponent, and that he should have grasped the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent at greater mastery. He only used an ordinary sword technique, so there must be other trump cards. Aside from Ye Feifan and Zhang Yue, Wang Yue's cultivation was at the first transformation of the Nivana Stage and instantly became a popular candidate within Di Group.

“Ye Qingtian will face Wang Yue in the next round!”

“Holy shit, you’re right!”

“This is interesting now.” Everyone was excited after realizing that Ye Qingtian would have to face Wang Yue in the next round.

Four hours later, the Loser Group’s battles ended, and each group was only left with thirty-odd people because the battles were too intense. So many people were heavily injured and had to back down. Some even won, but they withdrew from the Ranking Battle.

There were those like Zhang Qiao, who was heavily injured and wouldn’t recover anytime soon.

The Quasi-Saint, Chi Yun, soared to the sky and said, “We’ll carry on the fight after half an incense’s time. Those who win will enter the top hundred three days from now and compete for the top ten! The Loser Group will also have to compete for the remaining quotas!”
