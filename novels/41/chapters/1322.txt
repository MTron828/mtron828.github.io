Chapter 1323 - Peerless Beauty

All eight Greater Elysium Core Realm experts lost their lives. Every single one of them was standing at the top of the pyramid on the Profound Wither Island, but all of them had died at this moment.

Their blood had dyed the snow on the ground red. Flower Burial was descending from the sky, donned in his Silver Moon Mask with his killing aura soaring to the sky. In the Silversnow Mountain Range, the remaining big sects’ disciples looked at Lin Yun with fear reflected in their eyes.

Without any hesitation, they turned around and fled for their lives. They no longer dared to stay here for a moment longer because Lin Yun was too terrifying. The eight big sects had joined forces to set up a trap for Flower Burial, trying to force him out before killing him.

In the beginning, this was all within their plans and Lin Yun would only be a supporting character. But who could’ve thought that Lin Yun was Flower Burial?

Outside the Profound Wither Island, everyone from the Ancient Barren Domain was completely dumbfounded by this scene. After all, those eight were at the pinnacle of the Greater Elysium Core Realm, and they were from big sects. But they still died and couldn’t even escape.

Regardless of whether it was the powerful sects or the big sects, all of them fell into a deadly silence. Lin Yun was only at the quasi-Elysium Core Realm and hadn’t reached the Elysium Core Realm, nor had he engraved an origin saint rune on his elysium core. So they couldn’t imagine how powerful Lin Yun would become when he reaches the Elysium Core Realm.

Was this the strength of the strongest genius in the history of Heavenly Paths? The eight big sects suffered a huge blow and their faces were ugly. They were feeling despair and helplessness because they knew that it would be impossible for them to take revenge against Lin Yun if he exits the Profound Wither Island.

“Who can suppress him if fated transcendents don’t appear?” A Dragon Pulse Realm expert sighed with a grave expression.

“He’s too strong, and I even doubt that’s his full strength. He seems to still have some hidden trump cards.” Someone said, making everyone fall into silence.

“He’s strong, but he’s too overbearing. He revealed his identity without knowing who his true opponent is, so he will only end up dead.”

“That’s right! The eight big sects were merely chess pieces. The Profound Sky Sect is the one who wants to deal with him!” Those who were unconvinced and unhappy with Flower Burial spoke out. But their words weren’t false. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

For some time, everyone could already tell that the eight big sects definitely had another objective in setting up this huge formation. But they had underestimated Lin Yun’s strength and so, they failed. If they knew that Flower Burial was so strong right from the beginning, they wouldn’t have set this up and get themselves killed.

“He’s just showing off. When Qin Cang refines the saint rune, Lin Yun will definitely die. After all, the Demonflame Lotus that Qin Cang is refining is tainted with the blood of a true dragon. It's rare even, in the Ancient Era.”

“That’s right. In the end, his cultivation is too low. The great saint origin will soon appear, and it’ll be too late, even if he finds an origin saint rune now.”

“Not good!” Suddenly, someone looked at the screen and became nervous.

In the Silvermoon Mountain Range, two pillars of light suddenly exploded with lightning and a beam of light soared into the sky, reaching a terrifying height. The auras that they were releasing far surpassed the eight Greater Elysium Core Realm experts, and their astral energies were like blazing fires emitting terrifying auras.

“It’s the Three Saints of the Profound Sky Sect!” Many people were shocked, but they weren’t surprised because they already guessed that there must be a backup plan.

Back at the Silversnow Mountain Range, Lin Yun didn’t even have the chance to catch his breath before his face became grave. He could sense two threatening auras that were even stronger than the eight Greater Elysium Core Realm experts. They were so much so that even if the eight were added together, the eight still couldn’t be compared to these two auras.

This further proved that the eight sects were mere chess pieces placed on the surface. Lin Yun had already guessed this because it was the Profound Sky Sect who was trying to force him to show himself.

Not long later, two figures flew over, and they were shining with bright light in mid-air. Although there were only two of them, their auras were comparable to an entire army.

“Profound Sky Saint Sovereign, strongest of the Ancient Barren!”

“Lei Xue and Xuan Ying wish to experience Flower Burial’s strength. Let us see how strong the champion of the Heavenly Path is!” Their voices were fused with their astral energy, echoing throughout the Silversnow Mountain Range.

.

Everyone was completely shocked because they couldn’t believe that Lei Jue and Xuan Ying of the Three Saints of the Profound Sky Sect actually came. At the same time, they figured that they must have been waiting.

In the next second, Lei Jue and Xuan Ying had already appeared a thousand meters away from Lin Yun and descended from the sky. Shortly after, even more disciples and elders from the Profound Sky Sect also arrived and landed behind the two of them.

This scene made the faces of Qin Cang, Zhang Ting, and Jiang Lichen become ugly. Aside from Qin Cang and some top-tiered elders, all the forces of the Profound Sky Sect were practically here, and everyone knew that the Profound Sky Sect was an overlord in the Ancient Barren Domain. In terms of strength, they were even stronger than the Sword Sect.

If it wasn’t for the Radiant Sword Saint, the Profound Sky Sect would’ve dominated the entire Ancient Barren Domain. So they couldn’t help being shocked that the Profound Sky Sect actually prepared such a huge formation just to deal with Lin Yun.

“Flower Burial, come with us. My Senior Brother wishes to see you,” said Lei Jue coldly.

Xuan Ying, who was standing to the side, smiled, “My Senior Brother, Qin Cang, comes from the Nether Divinity Clan, and I believe that you’re not unfamiliar with that name.”

They were prideful. Although they said that they wish to experience Lin Yun’s strength, they didn’t even place Lin Yun in their eyes at all. Their tones were filled with disdain, and they sounded more like they were commanding Lin Yun instead.

“Since I dared to put on this mask, I naturally won’t hide my enmity with the Nether Divinity Clan,” said Lin Yun indifferently.

“Since that’s the case, then come with us.” Lei Jue snickered. “Don’t force us to make a move. Otherwise, not only you but everyone from the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect will be dragged into this matter.”

Sneering inwardly, Lin Yun said, “I don’t understand. So why don’t you explain it more clearly to me?”

The moment he said that, everyone became nervous. Lei Jue and Xuan Ying were both fated transcendents ranked at the top there on the Empyrean Ranking. Even the Sword Sect’s Sikong Zhou was ranked beneath the two of them, but Lin Yun didn’t even give them any face.

Lin Yun had just undergone a battle. So even if he was strong, he already revealed so many of his trump cards, not to mention the exhaustion from his fight. It was so much so that he might have even suffered some internal injuries from attacks like the Demonic Lion Roar from the Myriad Beast Gate’s elder.

The blowing snowflakes suddenly stopped, and a chill had frozen the entire region with Lei Jue and Xuan Ying’s faces both sinking.

“Then, I’ll have to ask Flower Burial for some guidance!” Lei Jue said coldly with his eyes squinted. He then retreated with Xuan Ying while ten-odd people from the Profound Sky Sect charged over. Among them, there were at least three Greater Elysium Core Realm experts, and the three of them didn’t exceed the age of fifty.

This was the foundation of a powerful sect, the foundation of the Ancient Barren Domain’s undisputed overlord.

“I have a song, and I’d like some comments from you guys!” As the faces of everyone from the Profound Sky Sect changed, a flute appeared in Lin Yun’s hand, and he closed his eyes. Before everyone could react, a piece of flute music resounded.

With his noble tune and sword intent combined in this music, it sounded like a ferocious, echoing roar. This caught those who were charging over by surprise. Before they could even summon their constellations, they were already enveloped by the music and immediately stopped.

No matter how they tried, they couldn’t get close to Lin Yun, and they were swinging their weapons while facing an unimaginable sword aura. This was Lin Yun wielding the flute as his sword, using music to perform a sword technique.

The intent contained in his music was majestic, and Lin Yun even used some of his firmament sword intent in his music. Others wouldn’t be able to find anything wrong with his music, but the faces of those who were enveloped in his music were ugly. Even the three Greater Elysium Core Realm experts were being suppressed by Lin Yun’s music.

What’s going on? Lei Jue and Xuan Ying were both shocked, and they could only look at Lin Yun, who was enveloped in the moonlight. Lin Yun merely used a flute to suppress the ten-odd people from the Profound Sky Sect, and this includes the three Greater Elysium Core Realm experts.

This was simply too unbelievable. Just when they were hesitating and finally decided that they would help, zither music suddenly resounded as a beam of light shot out, carrying a woman dressed in white, and her zither.

Her zither music had perfectly combined with Lin Yun’s flute music, causing the Profound Sky Sect’s disciples who were trapped to throw out mouthfuls of blood before they lost their consciousness.

As countless people who were near the Silversnow Mountain Range turned their heads over, they could see a woman dressed in white wearing a bamboo hat and a veil covering her face. Although her appearance was covered up, everyone could tell that she was a peerless beauty.
