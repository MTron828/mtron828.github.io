Chapter 958 - Get Lost!

Although Chen Xun was a little annoying, he spoke a lot of truth. The current Lin Yun was still too tender to compare with the heaven-defying geniuses of the Heavenly Path. Cultivation was a person’s foundation, so it would be even more difficult for him to catch up to the geniuses if he only relied on his sword intent. After all, the top-tier geniuses also had powerful martial intents.

“Perhaps I’ll have to take some risks in the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm.” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with a bold thought. He thought about reaching the third soul Heavenly Soul Realm in the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm.

When he glanced around, he could see people moving around. However, it seemed like no one was finding success. Should I continue searching? Chen Xun’s analysis about this place being worthless seemed logical to Lin Yun. He knew that he should go find the inheritances of the seven powerful sects if he truly wanted to find a treasure.

“I should at least test this dao artifact.” Lin Yun’s gaze fell onto the sword in the ground. The owner of this sword was already gone, but the sword still existed. Just when Lin Yun was about to grab the sword, he suddenly thought about how he snapped swords in the past. This made him wonder if it also applied to dao artifacts.

Lin Yun grabbed the sword and sensed a powerful sharpness. When he pulled the sword out of the ground, the rust began to fall off as it shined brightly.

Suddenly, the sword seemed to buzz as if it were being threatened. The sword’s saint runes shined in fear of Lin Yun. All of this lasted for a brief moment before the sword turned into ashes.

“This…” Lin Yun was surprised as he looked at the empty sword hilt. In the past, the swords would immediately shatter. This time around, the sword held up for a while. It seemed like the ‘broken sword’ within his body was testing the dao artifact.

His ‘broken sword physique’ probably wasn’t in reference to breaking swords. It was more like the swords had to receive the acknowledgement of the ‘broken sword’ in his body. So this meant that the Flower Burial Sword had a huge origin and that it wasn’t spared because of its wooden metal.

It was a shame that the sword couldn’t escape Lin Yun’s ‘broken sword physique’ and that it was corroded by the passage of time.

Lin Yun looked around to figure out his next move. He felt like the battlefield had to contain something good. Plus, if he didn’t reach the second soul Heavenly Soul Realm, he knew that it would be difficult to compete with experts like Chen Xun.

“I’ll just take a quick look around.” After making up his mind, Lin Yun started his search again. The deeper he went, the more dangerous things got. He noticed many remains that didn’t have the strength of an empyrean and were corroded by the demonic aura.

When Lin Yun was about to reach the core region, a few flack figures flew out from several large rocks. They charged at him with power, but before they could even get close, a crimson whip sent them flying.

Lin Yun looked carefully and noticed demonic corpses with mutations. The corpses were covered with black scales and had horns on their heads.

“Weird…” Lin Yun looked at the demonic corpses and locked his brows. It looked like there was a problem with this region. When he looked at the fog enveloping the core region, he could sense a mysterious feeling between the rocks.

Leaving the demonic corpse to Lil’ Red, Lin Yun bolted towards the foggy region. As he got close, his face became grave. He could sense an extremely dangerous aura as fear spread out in his heart.

“Can it be…” Lin Yun’s face changed as speculation filled his heart.RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Get lost!” Lin Yun sent several demonic corpses back with a wave of his hand before he entered the fog. Then, the scene before him changed drastically as a stone with spatial cracks appeared.

There were many sinister-looking corpses floating in the air. The corpses looked similar to the demonic corpses he had seen in the past. They even mimicked the appearance of the cultivators that they killed.

Many of these corpses had a finger-sized hole in their forehead, which was probably how they died. When Lin Yun looked around, he could see an old man in azure clothing at the very center of the stone.

Lin Yun could also see a dragon coiling around the old man’s clothes. Based on his clothes, everyone could tell that he was from an extraordinary sect. But they were even more shocked by the powerful aura that enveloped him after he died.

“I was right! It’s an existence above the empyrean realm,” muttered Lin Yun. As more figures broke through the blockade of demonic corpses, they took in a cold breath.

“An existence above the empyrean realm!”

“Doesn’t look like it. It seems to be someone who had just reached the Divine Core Realm…”

“How terrifying. Just how brutal was this battle that even a powerhouse in the Divine Core Realm died…” Everyone was looking at the azure-clothed old man with fire in their eyes.

“Get lost! This place is occupied by the Demon Slaughter Realm’s Xu Que.” Lin Yun recognized Xu Que as the person who tried to kill him at the shrine.

Everyone hesitated when they heard this and the Demon Slaughter Realm used this to their advantage. They started making their moves and killed several people, despite the quick retreat of the crowd.

Aside from the owners of the five astral spirits no one could stand against the Demon Slaughter Realm. In the blink of an eye, Lin Yun was the only one left aside from the Demonslaughter Realm.

“I never expected that we'd meet so quickly. If you’re willing to leave, I can put aside our grudge,” said Xu Que. Without his pet, Xu Que thought it would be hard for Lin Yun to face the Demon Slaughter Realm.

“I discovered the corpse first. You should be the one leaving,” smiled Lin Yun. Even if he wasn’t here first, he wouldn’t let this opportunity go. There was a high possibility that the corpse had a Divine Core, which far surpassed the value of Heavenly Astral Pearls.

A Divine Core contained the essence of a Divine Core Realm powerhouse, which was equivalent to Buddhist relics. It was the perfect way to make a breakthrough into the second soul Heavenly Soul Realm.

Xu Que’s eyes flashed coldly, “Lin Yun, just because I’m giving you face doesn’t mean you’re invincible. Do you really think you can fight fourth soul Heavenly Soul realm experts? If no one interfered in your fight with Liu Mu, you would be dead right now. The power of someone in the fourth soul Heavenly Soul Realm isn’t something you can imagine!”

As Xu Que spoke, the killing intent he emitted grew stronger. He thought that if Liu Mu wasn’t careless, there was no way Lin Yun could have injured Liu Mu. Plus, everyone knew that Liu Mu still had hidden trump cards. If it weren’t for the interference, Liu Mu would have killed Lin Yun.

The only thing that made Xu Que fearful was Lin Yun’s pet. The cat was a little strange and a little too strong, especially when it used the staff to suppress Mo Yan and two higher realms. Without Lil’ Red around, Mo Yan didn’t feel worried.

As long as he was prepared for Lin Yun’s imperial fortune martial technique, it wouldn’t be hard for him to take Lin Yun down. Simultaneously, everyone from the Demon Slaughter Realm started to emit their killing intent.

“Lin Yun, I’m giving you one more chance. Leave, now!” Xu Que unleashed his origin energy with no intention of letting Lin Yun go.

Lin Yun wasn’t even bothered with Xu Que’s words and said, “Get lost!”
