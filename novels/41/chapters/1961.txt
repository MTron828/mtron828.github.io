Chapter 1962 - Let Me Show You!

Lin Yun was briefly stumped before his expression eased up. The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint naturally wouldn’t blame him for being disrespectful and only pointed out the loophole in his words.

Others didn’t know, but Lin Yun naturally understood the meaning of the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint’s words. Could it be that the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint would punish him if he only praised Bai Shuying? So it was impossible for Xiao Jingyan and others to see Lin Yun punished.

But he ultimately had to explain, or that would mean that Bai Shuying was a peerless beauty and not the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint. If the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint was a beauty, why did Lin Yun only listen to the music and not the lecture?

Lin Yun briefly pondered and smiled, “Martial Aunt isn’t a peerless beauty.”

Everyone’s faces changed when they heard that. Even Bai Shuying furrowed her brows because Ye Qingtian was too bold.

But Lin Yun’s words changed as he smiled, “Martial Aunt is a fairy enveloped in saint radiance with a fog covering your appearance.”

“Cheeky with your words. You’re no different from your master,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said without any emotions in her tone. She continued, “I’ll let you go this once. I’ll continue my lecture now, and Shuying will carry on playing the zither.”

Lin Yun was alarmed upon hearing that, not knowing which master the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint was referring to. But he cupped his hands together, “Thank you, Martial Aunt.”

Everyone could only swallow it down in their hearts because they didn’t expect Ye Qingtian would be so easily let off. This naturally made them unhappy, especially Bai Yizhou of the Nether Orchid Courtyard.

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint continued her lecture, focusing on ‘Combining Yin and Yang, nurturing an indigo-glazed and untainted heart.’ Even the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint couldn’t be sure about that sentence and only shared her understanding.

Everyone else might not be able to understand, but they basked in the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint’s scriptures and saint radiance. Everyone could feel their comprehension of sword dao rapidly rising because of it.

Lin Yun also fell into deep thoughts because this sentence was filled with profundity.

When the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint was done, she took a brush and paper. As she started writing, saint radiance would appear around her, and each figure wielded a sword performing a sword technique. This immediately piqued everyone’s interest because they could tell that this sword technique was powerful, and it was more interesting than the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint’s explanation.

This immediately brought excitement to everyone’s faces because, compared to a lecture, sword techniques were easier in comparison. If they could learn something, it would allow their sword techniques to undergo a considerable boost.

Xiao Jingyan, Bai Yizhou, Ye Qinghong, and the others naturally noticed something. The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint had infused a complicated sword technique within her writing.

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint wrote down three ancient words, but no one could understand what she wrote.

“You guys can decipher the sword technique I included in my calligraphy. I will test you guys after a stick of incense time from now,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said.𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Everyone immediately started practicing and was shocked to discover that if they attempted to mimic the sword technique, a vague golden brush would appear and write down the words that the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint wrote.

It didn’t take long for someone to write the first ancient word. After this person was done, the golden word in front of him became condensed with sword intent filling it. This person was Bai Yizhou.

He was strong and the strongest amongst the Nether Orchid Courtyard’s swordsmen. It didn’t take long for Xiao Jingyan and Ye Qinghong to write down a word, but their words differed.

“As expected of the three senior brothers!”

“To derive a word in such a short time, they might be able to derive the three words in a stick of incense’s time.”

“They’re really talented.” Everyone exclaimed with envy on their faces.

The three were happy and wore smug faces, feeling that a stick of incense’s time was more than enough.

On the contrary, Lin Yun briefly practiced, then furrowed his brow. He had a feeling that something was lacking somewhere. It wasn’t because the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint’s attainment wasn’t profound, but the sword technique lacked something crucial.

After he had grasped the Azure Dragon Sword Heart, he had a keen sense for various sword techniques and always sought perfection. So he naturally felt terrible, like butterflies in his stomach, wanting to decipher the complete version.

“Time’s up.” Bai Shuying said, sweeping her gaze over. She smiled, “My master said that she would test you guys. I wonder who’s willing to step forth?”

When everyone heard that, a clamor resounded throughout the palace, and their gazes became heated.

“I’m willing to give it a try!” The Heavenly Yin Palace’s Xiao Jingyan stood up with a smile.

Bai Shuying nodded her head. Since the Heavenly Yin Palace stood out, the Dao Yang Palace’s Ye Qinghong naturally couldn’t just watch and stood up as well, with the Nether Orchid Courtyard’s Bai Yizhou and Upper Nine Peaks’ Zhang Kui following behind. They wanted to display their talent before the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint and give her a deep impression.

“Anyone else?” Bai Shuying asked, looking around.

“I’m willing to give it a try!”

“Me!” Almost everyone stood up, wanting to perform well before Bai Shuying. All of them were aloof as swordsmen, and not everyone was fully convinced by Xiao Jingyan.

Lin Yun smiled when he saw this scene because these people were confident. He managed to decipher the three words within a stick of incense’s time, but it wasn’t perfect.

It didn’t take long for Bai Shuying to pick out eight people. When the eight were chosen, the palace calmed down because the eight were at the seventh transformation of the Nirvana Stage. Compared to them, everyone else was inferior, and they did not need to become stepping stones.

“Ye Qingtian, why have you become quiet now? Why don’t you come up and try it as well?” Lin Yun didn’t want to be involved, but Bai Shuying’s face was cold and descended before him.

“Me?” Lin Yun replied, “I can’t even decipher a single word. So don’t make things difficult for me.”

“Let my master take a good look, then. Come up,” Bai Shuying said, wanting to embarrass Ye Qingtian.

Lin Yun was briefly stunned, before he bitterly smiled. Bai Shuying was really ruthless, wanting him to go up on the stage even when he said he couldn’t decipher anything.

“Nether Orchid Holy Maiden, don’t make things difficult for him. It’ll be funny if he can’t write anything and comes up with nonsense. He probably didn’t pay attention earlier and was thinking about women!” Ye Xin said with the corner of his lips rising.

Everyone laughed because Ye Xin was still holding a grudge against Lin Yun.

But Lin Yun wasn’t bothered and asked, “Senior Sister, you really want me to go up?”

“Of course. Otherwise, who am I talking to? Since you’re the secluded disciple of the Dragon Origin Great Saint, there must be something special about you, and I naturally have to take a look.” Bai Shuying’s pupils flashed with a cunning light. Since Ye Qingtian embarrassed her earlier, she would embarrass him now.

“Alright, then. Since you want to see it, I’ll show it to you,” Lin Yun smiled and stood up, waving his hand.

On the contrary, Yuan Chen was nervous because he witnessed how Ye Qingtian couldn’t write down a single word and didn’t seem to be acting when he furrowed his brow. But it wasn’t Lin Yun’s style to take it lying down after being challenged.

The surroundings fell silent because Ye Qingtian was as cocky as before. Many people noticed how he failed to write even a single word, and this clearly proved that his comprehension didn’t go smoothly. Yet, he still wanted to show off to the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden by standing out.

“Show what? Show how embarrassing your are? Ye Qingtian, you should learn how to be humble!” Ye Xin said with disdain flashing across his pupils.
