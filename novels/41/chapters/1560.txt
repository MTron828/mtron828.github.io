Chapter 1561 - Thunderfrost Intent

“Ye Ziling doesn’t dare to come out, aren’t you just some cannon fodder?” Liu Xu snickered with disappointment flashing across his pupils, looking at Jin Xuanyi.

“You’re overthinking it!” Jin Xuanyi’s eyes flashed with rage because Liu Xu was a little too arrogant. He was so arrogant even before they fought.

“You don’t believe me?” Liu Xu indifferently looked at Jin Xuanyi. “You still think the Sword Sect has returned to what it was in ancient times? The times have changed. Under the altercation of the Saint Sovereign, the cultivation of my Profound Sky Sect has long surpassed your Sword Sect. I don’t even need to draw my sword to face you!”

Jin Xuanyi’s face froze because Liu Xu was no longer looking down on him but looking at him with contempt. The disciples of the other sects also calmed down because what Liu Xu said wasn’t wrong. Back then, the Profound Sky Sect was insignificant and couldn’t even be compared to the Profound Valley and Heavenly Note Sect.

But ever since Tian Xuanzi rose and completed the Profound Sky Canon, the Profound Sky Sect was no longer the same as before. The completion of their martial system was the reason why they could catch up to the Sword Sect. The Sword Sect’s decline wasn’t because the Radiant Sword Saint was running out of lifespan but because Tian Xuanzi was a genuine genius.

But it was undeniable that Liu Xu was really arrogant, claiming that he didn’t have to draw his sword to defeat Jin Xuanyi. One must know that Jin Xuanyi wasn’t a nobody in the Sword Sect.

“What arrogance!” Jin Xuanyi coldly snorted and circulated the Gold Firmament Sword Sutra. A mighty sword aura exploded from him. Jin Xuanyi had reached a high stage in the Gold Firmament Sword Sutra. He could take a step further if his cultivation didn’t limit him.

When Jin Xuanyi’s sword radiated with a golden light, as if basking in the sun, Liu Xu smiled while releasing moonlight from his pores. As the radiating moonlight emitted a powerful sword aura, his body became shiny before he threw a punch forth.

As an explosion echoed, Jin Xuanyi’s sword aura collapsed under that punch before it could even approach. This made Lin Yun surprised because Liu Xu had merged his sword intent with his fist. This was the first time he had seen someone achieving that so perfectly, aside from himself.

Liu Xu gave Lin Yun a feeling similar to when Jin Jue was using the Heavenly Moon. But, simultaneously, it was different. It was more like the Heavenly Moon Fist Technique or Heavenly Moon Sword Technique.

Lin Yun’s heart sank because Tian Xuanzi was a little too terrifying. He could alter the Profound Sky Canon, comparable to a dragon spirit martial technique, into a sword or fist technique.

“Not good!” Mu Xueqin’s heart sank when she saw this scene. Liu Xu probably cultivated the Profound Sky Canon, while this fist technique should have been altered not too long ago. So she began to wonder if it was Tian Xuanzi who modified it.

“Hehe! Take another punch from me!” Liu Xu roared as moonlight soared into the sky from him under everyone’s shocked gazes. As the sky turned dark, Liu Xu’s punch collided with the tip of Jin Xuanyi’s sword.

After a clash, Jin Xuanyi was shocked because his sword was nearly knocked out of his hand. But how was that possible? The Gold Firmament Sword Sutra was known for its piercing attribute. Yet, Liu Xu took his attack head-on with his fist.

“Once more!” Liu Xu laughed as the moonlight he emitted condensed into a jade monument that enveloped him.

When Jin Xuanyi’s sword clashed with the jade monument, sparks flew and the sword was being pushed back. Simultaneously, Liu Xu kept approaching while his moonlight came crashing down on Jin Xuanyi’s sword aura. Occasionally when Jin Xuanyi’s sword ray landed on Liu Xu, it was blocked by the gentle moonlight around him, and he only suffered superficial injuries in his advance.

Looking at Liu Xu, who was being enveloped in the moonlight like a cloak, Lin Yun knew that Jin Xuanyi was about to be defeated.

“Moon Shattering Heaven!” Jin Xuanyi no longer held back, seeing that his sword aura was being suppressed. Since they couldn’t use their constellation in this fight, Jin Xuanyi resorted to his second strongest attack and his sword aura began to rise. When he swung his sword, every corner of this stage was covered with his sword rays.

“Moon Shattering Heaven? It sounds like it’s meant to deal with me, but it’s useless.” Liu Xu roared. The jade monument then shattered, and a screen appeared above him. Shortly after, a small moon appeared behind him with the screen spreading out, then overlapping with the initial heaven. “Lesser Heavenly Moon!”

Jin Xuanyi’s sword ray landed on the screen, but it only made Liu Xu take a few steps back.

“My turn now.” Liu Xu grinned as he charged forth. Eight moves later, his punch fell onto Jin Xuanyi’s chest, making Jin Xuanyi throw out a mouthful of blood before he fell to his knees and slid a few hundred meters across the ground.

“You lost.” Liu Xu smiled.

“Come back.” Mu Xueqin called out, her face being somewhat ugly. After all, not only was Jin Xuanyi defeated, but he was terribly defeated. When Jin Xuanyi returned, his face was filled with shame.

“Don’t speak. Let me take a look at your injuries,” said Mu Xueqin. Even if the Sword Sect was greatly embarrassed in this fight, the disciples' safety was her utmost priority.

“This is a Profound Wither Pellet. Swallow it.” Mu Xueqin briefly examined Jin Xuanyi’s injuries and took out a Profound Wither Pellet straightaway. She discovered that his injuries were heavier than she had imagined.

Looking at this scene, Lin Yun knew that Mu Xueqin was like her father, having deep feelings for the sect.

“The famous Gold Firmament Sword Sutra of the Sword Sect is disappointing. The strongest sect of swordsmen in the Ancient Barren Domain? Are you guys serious about that?” Liu Xu smiled. “Saint Disciple Ye Ziling, do you think I’m qualified to fight you now?”

Liu Xu came prepared since he could defeat Jin Xuanyi without drawing his sword. It was no wonder why he was so confident, and Luo Yuan played a game of good chess by having him come out first. It didn’t matter if Ye Ziling accepted the challenge or not. The Sword Sect had already lost because a nameless Liu Xu was enough to force a saint disciple to come out.

If Ye Ziling didn’t go up, no one else other than the saint disciples had a chance. After all, Ji Shuxuan was on the same level as Jin Xuanyi. Since Jin Xuanyi lost so terribly, there was a high chance that Ji Shuxuan would lose. But if Ye Ziling was defeated, the Sword Sect would suffer two defeats, which would be a massive blow to their reputation.

A smile appeared on Luo Yuan’s face as he shook the wine in his hand. This was all within his expectations. He was satisfied with Liu Xu’s performance, which gave the Profound Sky Sect a good start.

“Senior Sister, let me go!” Ji Shuxuan said, looking at Mu Xueqin. He was under tremendous pressure, but he had no choice because others might think that the Sword Sect didn’t have anyone else if he didn’t.

“I’ll fulfill his wish, since he wants to challenge me.”

Before Mu Xueqin could reply, Ye Ziling had already stood up.

This made Mu Xueqin briefly hesitate before she ultimately nodded her head.

Ye Ziling gently landed on the stage, and her long legs were highly striking. When Liu Xu looked at Ye Ziling, who was a hundred meters away, he couldn’t help licking his lips. Her legs alone could drive many men insane, and she also had a unique temperament. This just made others want to dominate her even more.

“Ye Ziling is out to fight!”

“I heard that she’s the daughter of Jian Jingtian and now the disciple of the Indigo Lightning Saint Lord. It is said that she has been in seclusion for a year.”Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Are you serious?”

“Of course. She might have ‘Ye’ as her surname, but there’s no doubt that she’s the daughter of Jian Jingtian. I wonder how much of Jian Jingtian’s talent she inherited.”

“This became interesting now…” When Ye Ziling appeared, she instantly became the center of attention, and just her identity as Jian Jingtian’s daughter alone was enough to garner so much attention. Not to mention that she was also a beauty with a unique temperament.

With flames blazing in his pupils, Liu Xu smiled, “Jian Jingtian is your father, and the Indigo Lightning Saint Lord is your master. You have a pretty impressive origin, and I don’t have any regrets even if I lose today.”

He was pretty clever to point out Ye Ziling’s identity. This was enough to ensure he wouldn’t be embarrassed if he lost. But if he won, Ye Ziling would only become a stepping stone for him, and the Sword Sect would be significantly humiliated.

“Make your move, instead of talking.” Ye Ziling furrowed his brows.

“I ask for Lady Ye to go easy on me… Lesser Heavenly Moon!” Liu Xu smiled and circulated the Profound Sky Canon, immediately executing the Lesser Heavenly Moon. This time, it was even more terrifying, reaching the level of eight-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm experts. When his aura reached its limit, Liu Xu stomped his foot on the ground and dashed forth.

After soaring into the sky, he stomped his foot on the moon and moonlight was blazing on him as the astral energy within his body boiled. This scene made everyone’s hearts sink because Liu Xu’s attacks weren’t humble, he’s purposefully trying to embarrass Ye Ziling, a saint disciple of the Sword Sect. But what was even more shocking was that he looked like a sword when he dashed over after stomping on the moon.

This scene made everyone take in a cold breath and finally know why Liu Xu didn’t use his sword. He was clearly a body-refining cultivator and had tempered his body to the point of becoming a saint sword. Since his body was like a sword, he naturally didn’t need a sword.

But Ye Ziling maintained the indifference on her face, with no signs of panic. Suddenly, a terrifying chill exploded from her body that swept out like a blizzard. As a Radiant Snow Flower bloomed within her pupils, she gently pushed her palm forth as a draconic roar echoed out.

Before Liu Xu could even get close, he slowed down under the dragon's roar. When Ye Ziling’s palm arrived, Liu Xu was sent flying back.

“How is this possible?!” Liu Xu was surprised. He naturally didn’t hope to inflict severe injuries on Ye Ziling with that attack since his two trump cards were hidden after this attack. But Ye Ziling had already ended his schemes before they began.

But it would only make it more interesting. After all, it would be too dull if he won so easily. As Liu Xu spun in mid-air, he landed on the hovering moon and looked down on Ye Ziling.

“Get down here.” A cold light flashed across Ye Ziling’s pupils as she tugged with her right hand. When the snowflakes formed into a dragon that was constructed of snow and lightning, the dragon coiled around Liu Xu. Liu Xu’s smile froze on his face, his pupils radiated with fear as he struggled to break free.

“Thunderfrost Intent?” Lin Yun’s eyes lit up because Ye Ziling seemed to have combined the Thunderfrost Intent with her Divine Dragon Sword Physique. Before he could think more about it, the moon beneath Liu Xu exploded and he was dragged over to Ye Ziling.

As Ye Ziling reached out, she grabbed onto Liu Xu’s throat and a terrifying chill enveloped the latter.
