Chapter 1094 - Phoenix Rebirth Through Flames

The hole that Feng Jue dug for Lin Yun had far exceeded anything he could have imagined. Both becoming a core disciple and ascending the Sword Saint Mountain had created a huge controversy in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. Then again, Lin Yun naturally knew nothing about it as he was still cultivating.

Three days had passed in the blink of an eye, and Lin Yun had successfully made a breakthrough into the sixth soul Heavenly Soul Realm. The entire process went smoothly without any accidents. After all, Lin Yun had prepared a total of 3,000 Divine Astral Pellets for this breakthrough.

When Lin Yun opened his eyes, his pupils were shining brightly in the darkness. After reaching the sixth soul, he became a lot stronger. He was twice as strong as he was when facing the Imperial Feather Realm Son. Additionally, he had four Demonic Astral Flowers in each of his aura oceans. In total, he had an astonishing number of 24.

Lin Yun was confident that if he ran into the Imperial Feather Realm Son again, he could easily defeat the latter without even using his sky sword intent. After all, Lin Yun wouldn’t be inferior to a seventh soul genius in Kunlun Realm with his current strength. The terrifying foundation of 24 Demonic Astral Flowers was simply unimaginable to the core disciples in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect.

At this moment, Lin Yun sighed out of joy. The Divine Astral Pellets were well worth the pain. They were so pure that they refined his origin energy. In the future, all of his impurities from the pellets and herbs he had taken in the Heavenly Path would be expelled.

“Lin Yun, you’re only one step away from making a breakthrough in the Iris Sword Sutra. You’re doing this on purpose, right?” Lil’ Purple grumbled in the subconscious space. After all, Lin Yun could make a breakthrough in the Iris Sword Sutra when he made a breakthrough in his cultivation. It seemed like he was holding back on purpose.

“Looks like you’re not stupid,” said Lin Yun.

“Hmph, you think you can bluff this empress? Make a breakthrough quickly! I can’t stand staying in your subconscious space anymore!” Lil’ Purple pouted as her braids pointed upwards like two horns.

Lin Yun also didn’t want to hold back his cultivation on purpose and asked, “Answer me first. What relationship do you have with the Iris Sword Saint?”

“Hmph, didn’t I tell you back then? He was my servant and only managed to slay a god as a saint all thanks to me. Without my guidance, he would be an ordinary sword saint. In ancient times, there were tons of saints, and he would have been nothing compared to them…” Lil’ Purple repeated with a tone full of disdain.

“Why do I get the feeling that you were captured by him? The Iris Sword Sutra should be used to restrict you. In fact, I believe your relationship was the other way around, right?” Lin Yun smiled.

“I told you already! I’m the Supreme Heavenly Slaughter Empress of Four Seas, Eight Barrens, 36 Heavens, and 72 Earths!” Lil’ Purple said sternly.

“But you were sealed by him,” said Lin Yun.

Lil’ Purple began speaking, “This empress…”

“But you’re sealed by him,” interjected Lin Yun.

“Shut up! I’m from the Divine Phoenix Clan…” said Lil’ Purple.

“But you’re sealed by him.” Lin Yun kept repeating his thoughts over and over, which made Lil’ Purple so furious that she gave up. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Hmph, I’m not going to stoop down to your level. Anyhow, make a breakthrough quickly or you won’t be able to receive the Iris Sword Saint’s inheritance and the secret in the sword box. Hmph, you’ll still have to beg me at that time!” Lil’ Purple turned her head away in disdain.

“It doesn’t matter. There are many inheritances in Kunlun Realm, not to mention that I’ll be heading to the Sword Sect in a year’s time.” Lin Yun smiled.

“I’m sorry…” Lil’ Purple couldn’t bear it anymore. “My relationship with that brat is complicated. Please unseal me first! I won’t treat you badly. Without my guidance, you won’t be able to learn the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon. There are many inheritances in Kunlun Realm, but the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon matches you the best.”

She had been in deep slumber for too long and had lost her patience. So she was furious that she had to beg Lin Yun. So she made up her mind to teach Lin Yun a lesson the moment he unsealed her.

Lin Yun naturally knew what she was planning, but he didn’t expose her. “Remember your words then. As long as you don’t let me down, I won’t let you down either.”

When he was done, he began to circulate the Iris Sword Sutra. He formed multiple seals with his hands that caused Iris Flowers to bloom around him. Then, a sword hum rang like music.

As more Iris Flowers bloomed, Lin Yun’s heart throbbed violently. His blood was trembling under the sword music and a powerful sword intent filled up every corner of his body. The power was so immense that it made Lin Yun’s face red. It was like his body would explode at any time.

“Break!” When the sword music reached its limit, Lin Yun squinted his eyes while his hair began to flutter violently. With a crackling sound, the bottleneck of the Iris Sword Sutra finally broke. A blurred figure appeared before Lin Yun with a sigh.

“Senior!” Lin Yun was shocked because the figure was the Iris Sword Saint. With that, the Iris Sword Sutra had reached the sixteenth stage. The Iris Flower with hundreds of petals had appeared in his dantian. The petals began to fall as they were replaced with new petals.

When all the old petals were replaced, the Iris Flower had 16 new petals that looked as clear as crystal and as beautiful as jade. Every single one of the petals now had mysterious sword runes engraved on them. At the heart of the flower was a small cold purple flame. Although the number of petals had decreased, the sword runes engraved on the petals looked even more terrifying.

“Lin Yun, spread out a wisp of the Iris Sacred Flame.” Lil’ Purple’s voice sounded out, urging Lin Yun.

Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts before he circulated the Iris Sword Sutra. A wisp of Iris Sacred Flame blazed in his palm and hovered before him. The flame was emitting a terrifying chill along with terrifying spiritual energy. The spiritual energy was filled with an ancient aura that felt sacred.

Right at this moment, a blur flew out of Lin Yun’s subconscious space towards the Iris Sacred Flame. Then, the flame burned brightly with boundless vitality. As the flames became even more condensed, Lin Yun’s face changed and he took several steps back.

Phoenix rebirth through flames? Lin Yun’s eyes flashed as he understood why Lil’ Purple wanted the Azure Dragon True Bone. Normally, she would only be able to condense a spiritual body with the Iris Sacred Flame. But with the Azure Dragon True Bone, she could reforge her body. After all, it was the bone of an Azure Dragon King.

It wasn’t that far off from a Divine Dragon Bone, and it wouldn’t let her status as a member of the Divine Phoenix Clan down. Lin Yun gently patted his interspatial pouch and took out the Azure Dragon True Bone. He glanced at it briefly before sighing and throwing the bone into the flames.

When Lin Yun threw the bone into the flame, the bone cracked and dragon blood flowed out. The dragon blood then merged with the flame, strengthening the Iris Sacred Flame even further and speeding up the speed of the melting bone.

It didn’t take long for the Azure Dragon True Bone to be thoroughly incinerated. At this point, only the complete divine rune was present.

“The divine rune!” Lin Yun’s eyelid began to twitch with heartache.

The entire rebirth process took a long time. Lin Yun didn’t sit idly by as he circulated the Iris Sword Sutra, triggering the 24 Demonic Astral Flowers in his aura oceans. Not long after, Lin Yun had perfectly grasped control of the Iris Sword Sutra and Demonic Astral Flowers.

He could tell that the Iris Sword Sutra had a high grade. After all, it wouldn’t be easy for ordinary cultivation techniques to control 24 Demonic Astral Flowers.

“Let’s test the power of the Iris Sword Sutra!” Lin Yun executed the Flicking Divine Finger. It was the secret technique that the Iris Sword Saint left behind. Now that his sword intent and sword sutra had reached a high level, the power of the secret technique naturally increased as well.

When the Iris Flower began to spin in his violet palace, a sword rune on the petal began to light up. Boundless sword intent and immense pressure poured into Lin Yun’s arm, middle finger, and thumb.

At the same time, a gigantic Iris Flower bloomed behind Lin Yun with countless petals manifesting into a sea of flowers. Suddenly, Lin Yun gained a new insight into his Flicking Divine Finger and made a breakthrough.

His eyes flashed as he began to realize that the Flicking Divine Finger was really profound. After all, the jade slip that he learned it from said that this secret technique could even pierce through the stars. Soon, the power of three sword runes poured into his finger. He couldn’t imagine how powerful this new attack would be.

However, he waved his hand and dispersed the brilliance around his finger. He was afraid that this attack might pierce through the barrier of his residence and cause a huge commotion.

Raising his head, Lin Yun could see that dawn was arriving. The flame in front of him was still blazing with increasingly dense vitality. It appeared that Lil’ Purple wasn’t boasting and that Nirvana Pellet was in no way comparable to the vitality of the flame. It’s already dawn, when is she going to finish?

Lin Yun had to head to the Flying Cloud Palace at dawn and couldn’t stand guard forever. Suddenly, an explosion lit up the entire residence in rainbow colors as an adorable little girl appeared before Lin Yun. Her appearance was flawless and her temperament was ethereal.

“This empress is finally back after a hundred thousand years!” Lil’ Purple yelled with her tender voice.
