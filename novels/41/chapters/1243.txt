Chapter 1244 - Divine Firmament

Lin Yun was enveloped in a bright sword ray for a long time before it dissipated. When Lin Yun opened his eyes, his pupils were shining brightly while his sword intent retracted into his body. At this moment, his body felt like it was in great condition.

“Four more times left until the divine firmament sword intent is born,” said Lin Yun. He had barely gotten used to the rules in the Nine Li Illusion Realm, and the first level nearly took his life.

Lin Yun couldn’t imagine how terrifying the next few levels would be. Could it be that there was a huge difference between him and the old geezer? Lin Yun was baffled as he recalled the disdainful gaze the old geezer gave him.

“The next few levels should be easier. The Nine Li Illusion Realm might be dangerous, but the effects are also huge. I might not even need to reach the ninth level to unlock my divine firmament sword intent…” Lin Yun speculated and slowly stood up.

This time, Lin Yun placed 10,000 divine astral pellets on the altar and activated the altar with his blood. When war drums sounded out, Lin Yun’s consciousness sank into the Nine Li Illusion Realm once more. But the only difference was that he went into the second level this time.

Compared to the first level, the environment in the second level was even more disastrous. It was a sea of flames and demons could be seen everywhere. Lin Yun was now a demon shrouded in demonic aura and wielding a demonic sword.

In the second round, not only did he have to kill all the demons, but he also needed the willpower not to lose himself. After all, the demon in the heart was always a lot stronger than the demons themselves. So Lin Yun needed to protect his heart from being corrupted.

But the moment he went in, he was expelled from the Nine Li Illusion Realm. Throwing up a mouthful of blood, Lin Yun was baffled, “Is this an illusion realm that someone in the Empyrean Realm could stay in?”

But recalling what the old geezer said to him, Lin Yun gritted his teeth and entered the illusion realm once more.

Seven days later, Lin Yun finally succeeded in making it through the second level, killing all the demons. The illusion realm had tempered his heart like jade and also made his sword cocoon crack one more time.

With the increase in strength and sword intent, Lin Yun entered the illusion realm with renewed passion.

Half a month passed in the blink of an eye. Now, Lin Yun completed the fourth level. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

When the illusion disappeared before his eyes, Lin Yun could sense his aura exploding like a volcano. As his sword aura began to burst out at a visible speed, the purple mark on his forehead emitted a blazing radiance that made his forehead feel hot.

When his sword aura reached its limit, the sword cocoon in his forehead exploded and countless golden aura poured out. It didn’t take long for the golden aura to spread out into a golden ocean of sword aura. Listening to the sword cocoon cracking for the ninth time, Lin Yun let out a long sigh because the day had finally come.

Although he knew that the Nine Li Illusion Realm could temper his sword intent, he still couldn’t contain the joy in his heart when this moment finally arrived. He had been waiting for this moment for a long time.

When the sword cocoon broke, a dragon roar echoed out from the ocean of sword intent. It was followed by countless lightning blasts. Then, a golden azure dragon enveloped in a thunderstorm flew out of the cocoon.

“Azure dragon?” Lin Yun was baffled. Was the dragon his divine firmament sword intent? Lin Yun quickly figured out that it was his azure dragon sword aura. After reaching the divine firmament sword intent, it wasn’t a problem for his azure dragon sword aura to manifest a physical body.

The azure dragon coiled around the space before it dove into the ocean. But that wasn’t the end. After the golden mist fully dissipated, Lin Yun could see a golden human sitting on a piece of the broken cocoon. This golden human was emitting a dazzling brilliance like a miniature sun.

Lin Yun could sense that this golden human was another him, and that he could control it as he wished. With a single thought, the golden human clasped his hands together and emitted a dazzling brilliance. When the radiance reached a hundred feet, the entire ocean began to boil and then the golden human left this space.

When it left Lin Yun’s body, it manifested into a golden sword aura that enveloped Lin Yun, forming a beaming golden pillar that soared into the sky.

In the next second, the sound of heaven shattering could be heard. Feng Jue, who was playing chess with Jian Jingtian, couldn’t believe what he was hearing. He trembled before he stuttered, “That’s the sound of heaven shattering… it’s from Lin Yun’s direction!”

“You lost,” said Jian Jingtian as he moved a chess piece.

After looking at the chessboard, Feng Jue pointed at Jian Jingtian and asked, “D-Did you cheat in the game?”

“Did you see me cheat?” Jian Jingtian smiled, which made Feng Jue shiver.

“Hand it over. One round for one dragon origin pellet. You lost seven rounds today,” smiled Jian Jingtian.

Feng Jue cursed inwardly because Jian Jingtian was clearly being unreasonable.

“What’s wrong? You’re not going to admit your loss?” Jian Jingtian glared at Feng Jue.

“Take it!” Feng Jue ultimately gave seven dragon origin pellets and asked, “Speaking of which, what’s with the sound of heaven shattering?”

“What else? He probably reached the divine firmament sword intent,” said Jian Jingtian.

But when Feng Jue heard that, he had joy written on his face and smiled, “Grasping the divine firmament sword intent in the Empyrean Realm. Jian Jingtian, I don’t know what to say!”

“You think everyone’s stupid like you?” Jian Jingtian sneered while glaring at Feng Jue.

“Let’s go and take a look?” Feng Jue scratched his head. Among all the disciples that their master took in, he was the stupidest and only grasped the divine firmament sword intent after reaching the Dragon Pulse Realm. There was naturally no way he could be compared to Jian Jingtian or Lin Yun.

Jian Jingtian stood up and replied, “Let’s go, then.”

It didn’t take long for the two of them to arrive at where the altars were. The scene of the golden pillar soaring into the sky had formed a terrifying phenomenon with half the sky dyed gold from an unimaginable sword aura. But it was fortunate that this place was secluded or else this terrifying phenomenon would be seen in the entire Profound Azure Prefecture.

“It’s really the divine firmament sword intent…” Feng Jue muttered and was filled with emotions while looking at the golden pillar. He also didn’t expect that the youth from the Ninth Heavenly Path would grasp the divine firmament sword intent in less than a year after arriving in Kunlun Realm.

Suddenly, the golden brilliance disappeared along with the phenomenon. The boundless sword intent returned to Lin Yun’s forehead and he slowly opened his eyes. When he opened his eyes, he could see Jian Jingtian and Feng Jue descending from the sky. Feng Jue had joy written all over his face while Jian Jingtian had a faint smile.

“Greetings, Sect Master and Senior Brother.” Lin Yun bowed.

“Lin Yun, is the scenery up here nice?” Jian Jingtian smiled.

“I finally know what it means to manifest the sky with my sword. Everyone beneath the sky are ants.” Lin Yun wore a grave expression and looked at Jian Jingtian especially deeply when he said ants. With his sword intent reaching this height, he could finally see a piece of Jian Jingtian’s strength, which made his heart beat even wilder.

“Junior Brother, how big is your sword ocean, and what was born from your sword cocoon?” Feng Jue asked anxiously.

“The sword ocean is roughly 1,000 feet wide. As for the sword cocoon, an azure dragon and a golden human appeared,” replied Lin Yun honestly.

“Dual sword souls!” Feng Jue was shocked. Ordinary people would only get a golden human from their sword cocoon, and those with dual sword souls were extremely rare.

“Is that surprising?” Jian Jingtian asked faintly. “He has a high attainment in his azure dragon sword aura, so it’s reasonable that it would reach the height of a sword soul.”

“What about a thousand wide sword ocean?” Feng Jue asked again.

“Is a thousand-foot wide sword ocean impressive? Lin Yun, what do you think?”

Looking at the playful gaze from Jian Jingtian, Lin Yun shook his head, “It’s nothing compared to you, Sect Master.”

Jian Jingtian’s sword ocean was even bigger than ten thousand feet. But what Lin Yun said made Feng Jue speechless because Jian Jingtian was a little too much. It was like he was saying that it was nothing for Lin Yun to grasp the divine firmament sword intent while he was in the Empyrean Realm.

“What level did you reach in the Nine Li Illusion Realm?” Jian Jingtian asked.

“The fourth level,” said Lin Yun in a depressed tone.

“Not bad,” replied Jian Jingtian.

But when Feng Jue heard that, he felt pity for Lin Yun who was getting played by Jian Jingtian, who had only reached the third level in the Elysium Core Realm.

Just when he was thinking about it, Lin Yun looked at Feng Jue with a smile, “Senior Brother, do you have any more divine astral pellets? I still want to give the Nine Li Illusion Realm a try and see what the ninth level looks like.”

His sword intent had just reached the divine firmament sword intent, and he could use the Nine Li Illusion Realm to temper it so that he could reach lesser mastery as early as possible. He had run out of divine astral pellets, using up all the two hundred thousand divine astral pellets and his own fortune on the altar.

“Junior Brother, I’m really not keeping any from you. I really don’t have any divine astral pellets left.” Feng Jue smiled bitterly.

But right at this moment, Jian Jingtian chuckled, “He doesn’t have any divine astral pellets left, but he has dragon origin pellets. A dragon origin pellet can keep the altar running for half a month.”

Hearing that made Lin Yun’s eyes light up as he turned to look at Feng Jue. Sensing Lin Yun’s gaze, Feng Jue felt a chill down his spine. It felt like these two were working together to cheat him of his wealth.
