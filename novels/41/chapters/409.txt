Chapter 410 - Stand to the End

Everyone instantly recognized the origin of those seven swords. They were the famous Firmament Swords of the Sword Firmament Pavilion. The Firmament Swords were already terrifying by themselves and any one of them was greatly intimidating. So everyone was shocked to see all seven swords.

This scene had never happened before in the Great Qin Empire’s history. The seven Firmament Swords were only used in the past whenever the Sword Firmament Pavilion was threatened to form the Firmament Sword Array to protect the sect. But today, the seven swords were used for a single youth.

The swords buzzed on the ground and emitted an intimidating sword intent.

“The Sword Firmament Pavilion still made their move in the end…”

“I’m afraid that chaos will sweep through the Great Qin Empire!” Many of the old men who saw the swords from the buildings by the street sighed as their faces changed. The seven swords represented the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s attitude to protect Lin Yun.

A huge array was also formed in the sky. This was an array unique to the Sword Firmament Pavilion, the Astral Meteorite Array. This array could be formed using the disciples’ Firmament Tokens by the Pavilion Master. Also, the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s experts could descend like meteorites from the sky no matter where they were because of the array.

With the sudden change, all the buildings within a ten mile radius began to shake as cracks spread out. The shockwave from this clash had caused many people to throw up blood from their mouths as they were sent flying away.

Liu Feilong was stopped by the powerful sword intent coming from the seven Firmament Swords. However, Liu Feilong was the commander of Divine Guards and stood at the top of the Great Qin Empire’s pyramid. He didn’t take a step back, nor did he show any signs of retreat. On the contrary, he had fully unleashed his terrifying strength.

It felt like there was no limit to his strength as his aura constantly grew. This also made many people’s faces change as they quickly retreated.

“Death to anyone who challenges the royal family’s prestige!” Liu Feilong stabbed his spear forward.

The seven swords in front of Lin Yun began to tremble. They were fighting with the spear. For a moment, the seven swords were struggling to remain upright under the spear.

“Then again, the royal family has no rights to determine the life and death of our sect’s disciple!” Seven streaks of light descended on the ground. They were naturally the seven Sword-Bearing Elders who were pulling their swords from out of the snow.

“Set up the formation!” The seven of them knew how powerful Liu Feilong was and that none of them could last more than ten moves against him. They could only rely on the Firmament Sword Array to fight him.

No one could see Liu Feilong's expression under the silver helmet because the mask only revealed his cold eyes. The spear in his hand was like a raging dragon roaring within the array.

The seven Sword-Bearing Elders all felt pain in their palms from the impact and anyone could tell from their expressions that they were doing their best. At the same time, they were shocked that the Firmament Sword Array couldn’t stop Liu Feilong.

The battle between the eight was too shocking. Just the shockwave from their clashes alone could kill cultivators in the Profound Martial Realm. The grey-clothed old man and mysterious man had already backed down. When the mysterious man retreated, he also brought Lin Yun along with him.

“What power!”

“Liu Feilong is a little too powerful. He’s practically like a dragon. The Firmament Sword Array won’t be able to hold him back for long.” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“The Sword Firmament Pavilion has thoroughly fallen out with the royal family now…” The spectators were shocked by this scene. The four sects transcended the empire, but by themselves, none of the sects could contend with the empire.

But the four sects had a long history, so it wouldn’t be easy for the empire to defeat them. Even if the empire could win, it wouldn’t be an easy win. However, no one had expected that a war would start because of a youth.

Right at this moment, Liu Feilong’s spear shattered under the constant attacks from the seven Firmament Swords. This scene had caused the seven Sword-Bearing Elders to rejoice.

Qin Yu’s face also changed from the carriage when he saw this scene, so he threw out a crimson spear over, “Liu Feilong, use this spear!”

The spear he threw out emitted a shocking and ominous aura. No one knew how many lives this spear took.

“That’s the Bloodprison Demonspear!” Someone exclaimed from the crowd at the spear. It was the spear passed down through the Divine Guards, forged with countless souls and blood. This was a demonic spear and the Divine Guards rarely used it. But the moment it was used would be shocking.

“Blood Phoenix Prairie!” Liu Feilong executed his ultimate move when he caught the spear.

Under the demonic aura, the seven Sword-Bearing Elders threw up a mouthful of blood with a crack forming in their formation.

“Break!” roared Liu Feilong. The Firmament Sword Array was barely keeping him contained the moment he caught the Bloodprison Demonspear. He turned around and the spear in his hand divided into seven.

Each of the spears knocked a Sword-Bearing Elder away. Liu Feilong stood upright like a war god. When his gaze fell onto Lin Yun, the killing aura in his eyes began to gather.

“Who can stop me?” Liu Feilong snorted and dashed at Lin Yun. His action made everyone hold their breath because Liu Feilong was too strong. Everyone knew he was strong, but no one knew that he was this strong.

But before he could even take a step out, a streak of light appeared in the sky. When the streak of light appeared, it consumed everything and the sky turned dark.

Liu Feilong was knocked back by this attack. When the streak of light descended on the ground, it caused a huge explosion and all the buildings within ten miles of radius collapsed, except for some ancient buildings.

When everyone finally caught a glimpse of the light, they realized it was a sword. But it was one that not many people knew about.

“Isn’t that Light Containment?!” Liu Feilong’s face finally changed at this moment when he saw the sword.

Even Qin Yu’s face changed when he heard the name of the sword. He knit his brows tightly together. Looking up ahead, he saw four blurred figures approaching through the blizzard. The leader of the four’s aura wasn't any weaker than Liu Feilong.

“The four Guardians!”

“The four Guardians of the Sword Firmament Pavilion actually came!”

“Four Guardians and seven Sword-Bearing Elders. Aside from the Pavilion Master, the Sword-Firmament Pavilion’s top fighting prowess have gathered together!”

“That sword might be the one used by Jian Wuming to sweep through the Great Qin Empire!”

“Light Containment!”

“My heavens. That’s a sword that transcends a cosmic artifact. It’s also known as the strongest sword in the Great Qin Empire!” Everyone’s heartbeat raced when the four Guardians appeared with Light Containment.

No one now felt surprised that Liu Feilong was knocked back by this sword.

“Even bringing out Light Containment. Is the Sword Firmament Pavilion sure about standing against me, against the empire?” smiled Qin Yu.

“We don’t dare, but the Sword Firmament Pavilion is founded on the ideals of being firm like your sword. How can we continue to hold our swords if we can’t even protect our disciple? Lin Yun can’t die!” replied Guardian Plum. His voice was indifferent, but it sounded as though he had no fear for life and death.

“But he ruined my wedding, injured my guest, and killed the elites of my Divine Guards. If I don’t kill him, how can I maintain the prestige of the royal family?!” retorted Qin Yu.

“The Sword Firmament Pavilion won’t poke our nose in your matters since Xin Yan agreed to the marriage herself. But Lin Yun is our sect’s disciple and our sect should be the one to hand down his punishment for his wrongdoings, not the royal family!” responded Guardian Plum.

The Sword Firmament Pavilion was determined to protect Lin Yun. This caused a fluctuation in Qin Yu’s heart. Because if that was the case, then it might not be impossible for the Sword Firmament Pavilion to bring Lin Yun away.

Lin Yun might be worthy of hate, but Xin Yan was more important right now. As long as Qin Yu could complete his marriage with Xin Yan, he could always deal with Lin Yun after the Dragon Gate Competition.

“I won’t leave. I want to hear from Big Sister Xin Yan that she’s willingly marrying Qin Yu. Otherwise, I won’t go even if I die!” A stubborn voice came from Lin Yun that instantly made Qin Yu’s face ugly.

“Good! Good! Good!” Qin Yu laughed instead, saying, “Then none of you can leave today! Liu Feilong, order the entire Divine Guards to move out and take out the traitors of the Sword Firmament Pavilion!”

Liu Feilong hesitated for a moment before he waved his hand. A smoke signal flew into the sky and exploded, turning into a crimson bird that emitted a loud cry that caused the entire capital to tremble.

Shortly after, the ground began to tremble as a huge army rushed over from all directions.

On the carriage, Qin Yu sat with a gloomy face as he stared at the blurred figure in the blizzard. This was the last chance that he was giving the Sword Firmament Pavilion. If they could take Lin Yun away before the army arrived, then he could force himself to forgive them.

But he was disappointed when he saw Guardian Plum retrieving Light Containment. When Guardian Plum held onto the sword, he emitted a blinding radiance that looked like a dazzling sun.

Under that radiance, his blurred figure became clear and no one could see any hesitation on his face. Holding onto Light Containment, Guardian Plum looked at Qin Yu and barked, “The Sword Firmament Pavilion will stand to the end!”
