Chapter 1590 - I’m Born Before The Heaven!

Lin Yun's plan was simple and dangerous at the same time. After witnessing the strength of the four of them, he realized that he couldn’t deal with so many of them, especially since every single one of them wielded a terrifying weapon with a huge origin. He finally knew what Chen Ling meant now.

He wasn’t afraid if he fought one of them. But if he had to fight all four of them, he wouldn’t have any odds of winning. Aside from joining hands with the Heavenly Profound Tortoise, he didn’t have any other path now.

But this was a dangerous move because it was uncertain if the Heavenly Profound Tortoise would join hands with him. Secondly, they also might be unable to beat the four rising stars, even after joining forces because no one knew if they had more trump cards.

No matter what, what happened next was an answer to him. After hearing that Jiang Tong and others wanted to split it apart, the Heavenly Profound Tortoise didn’t have a choice but to cooperate with Lin Yun.

When the Heavenly Profound Tortoise released a terrifying chill, this caught Jiang Tong and others by surprise and could only release the restriction on the Heavenly Profound Tortoise.

“Retreat!” The four yelled as they swiftly retreated. Yan Jiao removed the Thunderflame Saint Whip from the Heavenly Profound Tortoise and used it to defend against the terrifying chill. But even so, a small portion of the blizzard still landed on him, and the power behind the snowflakes was comparable to an attack of a pinnacle third-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm expert.

This instantly made him feel terrible, but the snowflakes lasted a brief moment. He couldn’t imagine how powerful the Heavenly Profound Tortoise would become after it was familiar with the control.

The three others weren’t in a good position either. Their faces pale and ugly as they looked at the snow forming into a raging snow tornado. They were still laughing at Lin Yun for being a fool just a moment ago, then immediately received a slap on their faces. This nearly made them throw out blood, and their hatred for Lin Yun peaked.

It was fine if they were only slapped on their faces, but the Heavenly Profound Tortoise, which took great effort to control, broke free!

“Lin Yun, how dare you! I’ll swear I’ll torture you and not let you die so easily!” Jiang Tong roared.

“Make your moves. Stop wasting time chatting with him.” Qin Can said coldly. “We’ll work together to capture him while Brother Chang and Brother Yan hold back the Heavenly Profound Tortoise.”

Qin Can was decisive and unleashed a crimson blade ray at Lin Yun. The crimson blade ray wriggled in mid-air as if it was alive before manifesting into a faceless ghost that pounced towards Lin Yun.

Lin Yun also moved and formed the Sovereign Dragon Seal, circulating the dragon runes to smash the blade ray apart. During this period, Jiang Tong and Qin Can also arrive before the Heavenly Profound Tortoise, exchanging ten-odd moves in the blink of an eye. Lin Yun struggled to block their attacks without drawing his sword.

It didn’t take long for him to resort to circulating the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra and Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon. He knew he wouldn’t be able to last long and quickly transmitted his voice to the Heavenly Profound Tortoise, “Brother Tortoise, I need help!”

“I need to rest a little. That attack earlier took a lot out of me, and I’m also heavily injured. Human, give me an hour. I’ll slaughter these bastards after recovering!” The Heavenly Profound Tortoise said before sinking into the Cold Pond.

This instantly made Lin Yun inwardly curse as he quickly transmitted his voice, “Brother Tortoise, the water is poisonous. Aren’t you courting death?”

“It doesn’t matter. The azure dragon spiritual aura you left within my body can help me resist erosion, and I can take this opportunity to refine it. This might be an opportunity for me. So hold on for an hour. I’ll be invincible after an hour!” The Heavenly Profound Tortoise swiftly sank into the Cold Pond, creating a huge wave.

This caught Chang Yu and Yan Jiao, who were preparing to deal with the Heavenly Profound Tortoise, by surprise. Even Jiang Tong and Qin Can were shocked as they swiftly retreated. Only Lin Yun was left standing on the pond's surface when the waters calmed down.

This also made the corner of Lin Yun’s lip twitch since he was doomed.

“What’s going on?”

“Don’t care about the Heavenly Profound Tortoise for now. Slaughter this brat first before that tortoise!” Jiang Tong said as he charged towards Lin Yun. The three other rising stars nodded their heads, but they didn’t place Lin Yun in their eyes because he had just reached the Dragon Pulse Realm. Even if he was heaven-defying, there was no way he could face the four of them, and this was a befitting treatment for the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple.

“Blood Ghost Demonic Blade!”

“True Dragon Impact!” Jiang Tong and Qin Can held Lin Yun down, while Chang Yu and Yan Jiao used their saint artifacts against him. The attacks that were meant for the Heavenly Profound Tortoise all fell onto Lin Yun, and the phenomena created by their attacks were terrifying.

Knowing that he could only rely on himself, Lin Yun roared and drew the Flower Burial Sword. He then executed the Heaven Sword Form. Pushing his quasi-Heavenly Dome Sword Intent to the limit, his keen sense detected all the attacks aimed at him, and his sword moved before his opponents moved, which was a bizarre feeling. It felt as though he had grabbed onto something but nothing at the same time.

Sweeping the Flower Burial Sword back, the Thunderflame Saint Whip was knocked away. It was as though Lin Yun had a pair of eyes at the back of his head. But Lin Yun swung his sword soon after and blocked the Lightning Dragon descending from the sky.

“Kill him!” Qin Can and Jiang Tong unleashed their attacks to seal off Lin Yun’s path of retreat.

“Let’s see how you dodge this!” Jiang Tong’s face became sinister while pouring his dragon origin into the Thorn Fangs, and his fist emitted a terrifying crimson and golden light.

Meanwhile, Qin Can was indifferent as he unleashed eighty-one blades. As his blade rays intertwined, it was like an army charging at Lin Yun.

But the two’s movements had slowed down in Lin Yun’s eyes with the ancient ‘Heaven’ and ‘Earth’ words revolving behind him. He swung his sword a hundred and eight times in that split second, and each sword was directed at the flaw in Qin Can’s attack.

The blade rays were like crimson fireworks as they exploded in the air, leaving Qin Can dumbfound. His pupils were filled with disbelief that Lin Yun could capture the flaws in his blade technique under the siege of four people. Just how terrifying was Lin Yun’s attainment in the sword?

“I’ll give you one sword in return!” Lin Yun smiled as the ancient ‘Heaven’ and ‘Earth’ words flew toward Qin Can. The entire world was spinning, and Qin Can couldn’t block that attack.

Meanwhile, Lin Yun slanted his body to the side and avoided Jiang Tong’s punch at an incredible angle. Jiang Tong’s terrifying punch was like a dragon claw aimed at Lin Yun’s face, but when the punch flew past, Jiang Tong suddenly opened his hand, and the crack on his palm turned into a bloody jaw aiming to bite Lin Yun’s head.

If someone else were facing this attack, they definitely wouldn’t be able to respond in time. But Lin Yun managed to dodge his attack again as if he had already expected it. He leaned his body backward, and his back was closely stuck to the pond's surface. Slamming his palm on the pond’s surface, Lin Yun spun in mid-air before landing with one knee.

“Die!” Chang Yu and Yan Jiao charged again without giving Lin Yun time to catch his breath.

“You guys aren’t allowed to harm my big brother!” An ancient dracoape descended from the sky and blocked the two attacks with its back. After a huge impact, the dracoape’s back was covered with blood and two terrifying wounds.

“This beast’s skin is really tough!” Seeing that the Thunderflame Saint Whip only left behind a wound on the dracoape, Yan Jiao coldly commented.

“We’ll attack a few more times, then. It's just a pet!” Chang Yu held the Lightning Dragon Tablet and summoned the Lightning Dragon once more with the sky covered with lightning.

“Big Brother, I’m fine!” Lil’ Red gave Lin Yun a cheap grin, but this was a heart-aching smile at the same time.

When Lin Yun recovered, his chest was then filled with rage. As the fight continued, Lil’ Red used its back as a meat shield to block Yan Jiang and Chang Yu. Occasionally, it would use its staff to threaten the two. With Lil’ Red around, Lin Yun’s pressure in the fight was instantly alleviated. But when the flute music resounded once more, Lin Yun and Lil’ Red fell into another dangerous situation.

“Kill him!” Chang Yu and Jiang Tong were furious as they charged forth.

The difference in Lin Yun’s cultivation was gradually revealed as time passed. He could face two geniuses in the pinnacle third-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm because of his sword intent and the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron.

But as time passed, he gradually fell into a disadvantageous position with the exhaustion of his vitality. Even if his attainment in the sword was high, he couldn’t suppress his opponent as long as his sword intent didn’t make a breakthrough to the fifth grade.

Their battles soon destroyed the Cold Pond, and the phenomena in the sky looked terrifying.

“Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple, what other trump cards do you have?” Jiang Tong roared. He was covered in blood because of Lin Yun’s sword. As he injured Lin Yun, he was also wounded by Lin Yun’s sword, which was humiliating. The other people’s faces were also ugly since they were forced into this position when facing a swordsman at the first-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm.

Just when Lin Yun was about to bring out the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella, a dazzling silver light lit up this entire region and a petite figure appeared, looking like a deity.

“I’m eighteen years old, one year for each era. I’m born before the heaven, and I’ll still be alive even if the world is destroyed!” A phoenix cry echoed, and a powerful bloodline aura far surpassing the Heavenly Profound Tortoise enveloped this entire region.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

When Jiang Tong and others turned around, they squinted their eyes from the dazzling radiance, unable to grasp what was happening.

“Lil’ Purple!” Lin Yun and Lil’ Red leaned against each other with pleasant surprise in their eyes.
