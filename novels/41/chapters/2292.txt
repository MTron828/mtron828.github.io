Chapter 2293 - Sovereign Constellation

Under the phenomenon, Lin Yun fought the three sixth-stage Saint Lords in an evenly matched battle. His sword intent was like a bright sun as he performed the Carefree 9 Swords with the entire world spinning with his sword ray looking like ink drawn across the world.

“Damn it!”

“How is this fellow so powerful?!” The three sixth-stage Saint Lords were shocked. They were all sixth-stage Saint Lords, and they could easily suppress a fifth-stage Saint Lord with their strength. But even after they joined hands, they were being suppressed by Lin Yun. When the golden phenomena appeared, their saint auras could no longer suppress Lin Yun and were being suppressed by his sword intent, instead.

“Heaven and Earth Unite!” Hundreds of afterimages overlapped as Lin Yun swung his sword. The words ‘Heaven’ and ‘Earth’ fused and released a boundless sword aura that devoured the three sixth-stage Saint Lords before they were sent flying away.

When the three Saint Lords landed on the ground, they took several steps back.

“Suppress him with our golden pills!” The Heavenly Dusk Saint Lord’s words changed the other two Saint Lords’ faces. The golden pill was power, containing their daos and saint energy. But there were also side effects. They would be greatly weakened when they used their golden pill. They would be at Lin Yun’s mercy if they couldn’t kill him.

Most importantly, their foundation would be destroyed if their golden pills were damaged. At that time, they wouldn’t be able to make any progress in their cultivation. This was a dangerous move, but the three Saint Lords were forced to a dead-end.

When Lin Yun charged over, the Heavenly Dusk Saint Lord was the first to spit out his golden pill. When the golden pill appeared, Lin Yun’s sword intent was suppressed once more and he retreated while fighting. He retreated to a hundred meters away before he finally got out of the golden pill’s suppressive range.

“Golden pill?” Lin Yun was surprised and raised his head. A golden energy sphere that was a few hundred meters away shone like a bright sun. It was enveloped in daos with a powerful aura emanating from it, causing cracks in the golden phenomenon that was in the surroundings when it appeared.

This is his golden pill? Lin Yun felt great pressure and would have been heavily injured if was struck by the golden pill, even if he possessed a divine physique. As for his dipper energy, there was no way it could block an attack from a golden pill, since his cultivation was too low. While he was in deep thought, a powerful aura spread out when the other two Saint Lords also spat out their golden pills.

The three golden pills looked like three bright suns in the sky, attracting everyone’s attention. This might be a great battle with hundreds of Saint Lords fighting each other, but no one else had resorted to spitting out their golden pill.

“Are they insane?” The Astral River Saint Sovereign’s face changed before becoming dark, looking at the three Saint Sovereigns before him. The Jade Lotus Saint Sovereign was also shocked.

They weren’t the only ones. The three Saint Sovereigns from the three holy lands were also shocked. The Flame Cry Saint Sovereign asked, “What’s going on? They resorted to their golden pill to deal with a brat?”

“What’s going on?” The Ghost Cleanse Saint Sovereign muttered. The three Saint Sovereigns were facing the two Saint Sovereigns from the Divine Phoenix Mountain, and they never expected that three sixth-stage Saint Lords would be forced to that point in just a brief moment.

The Azure Glory Saint Sovereign’s face changed, and he gritted his teeth, “He killed the Ming Cult’s young sect master, so he has to pay the price. This is the mortal feud, and your Divine Phoenix Mountain insists on protecting him. So what if they were forced to spit out their golden pills? You can do the same if your Divine Phoenix Mountain is capable!”

“They’re insane.” The Astral River Saint Sovereign’s lips twitched, looking furious. A Saint Lord could easily heal their injuries as long as their wounds weren’t fatal, and an ordinary Saint Lord would have a long lifespan.

The battle might be chaotic, but not many Saint Lords would die in a battle of this scale. But it was different after bringing out the golden pill. This was because one could be heavily injured even if they managed to kill their opponent.

“Block them for me! I’ll go save him!” The Jade Lotus Saint Sovereign soon made a decision.

“Okay!” The Astral River Saint Sovereign agreed. This meant he had to face three enemies with his life on the line to buy time for the Jade Lotus Saint Sovereign.

Then, torrential murderous intent swept out from Lin Yun and dyed the sky red. This was the ninth sword form of the Carefree 9 Sword, which was pure killing. The shattered sword intent around him drifted like paper scraps before they released a dazzling sword ray, forming a ‘Kill’ word before entering Lin Yun’s body.

A rumbling sound appeared within Lin Yun’s mind as a terrifying sword ray appeared beyond the thirty-six layers of heaven. The thirty-six layers of heaven began to shatter as the sword ray formed into a ‘Kill’ word, descending from the sky. As the word descended, the radiance of the three golden pills became dim.

“Not good!” The faces of the three Saint Lords changed, but it was already too late as the massive and ancient word was like a collapsing high wall, shattering the three golden pills. When the golden pills shattered, the three Saint Lords threw out a mouthful of blood, their faces becoming terrifying pale as they fell from the sky.

Lin Yun tapped his foot on the ground and charged at the three Saint Lords.

“Stop these two! I’ll go save them!” The Azure Glory Saint Soveriegn’s face changed after coming to his senses. But just when he wanted to move, he was stopped by the Jade Lotus Saint Sovereign. The Astral River Saint Sovereign also took this opportunity to hold back the Flame Cry and Ghost Cleanse Saint Sovereigns.

As Saint Sovereigns, the Astral River Saint Sovereign could easily defeat any one of them. This was the reason why he could hold back the two Saint Sovereigns. On the other hand, this gave the three holy lands trouble when trying to break free, and the situation didn’t look good this time.

The Azure Glory Saint Sovereign became anxious, and yelled, “Ghost Cleanse!”

The Ghost Cleanse Saint Sovereign gritted and took a palm from the Astral River Saint Sovereign as the price. Blood dripped from his lips as phoenix fire blazed on him. But he ignored his injuries and held down the Jade Lotus Saint Sovereign for the Azure Glory Saint Sovereign. This allowed the latter to break free and charge at Lin Yun.

“Die!” The Azure Glory Saint Sovereign pushed his hands forth as the ink writing shattered under his aura.

Lin Yun executed the Profound Sword Form while facing the Azure Glory Saint Sovereign, but he failed to return the Azure Glory Saint Sovereign’s attack this time, and his sword aura shattered instead. When the remaining power of the Azure Glory Saint Sovereign’s attack landed on him, the saint runes on the Azure Saint Cloth began to light up, blocking the majority of the power. Even so, Lin Yun still took several steps back before he managed to stabilize himself.

“A Saint Sovereign?” Lin Yun finally knew why this attack was so strong as he looked at his assailant.

“I’ll kill you!” The Azure Glory Saint Sovereign charged over, not wanting to give Lin Yun the time to catch his breath. He knew that the other two Saint Sovereigns wouldn’t be able to hold back the Divine Phoenix Mountain’s Saint Sovereigns even if they gave it their all, so he only had enough time to make three moves. But that was more than enough for him.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Sun-Moon Seal!” The Azure Glory Saint Sovereign no longer held back and stepped forth before pushing his palm out. A seal manifested into the ‘Ming’ word that descended.

Lin Yun’s sword aura shattered under this power, and there was no way his sword intent could withstand the power of a Saint Sovereign. But Lin Yun wasn’t anxious. He was calm, instead.

“Let me see how you die!” The Azure Glory Saint Sovereign was furious, wearing a sinister expression.

Lin Yun raised his head and released his Azure Dragon Sword Heart. In the next second, the Azure Dragon Sword Heart merged with the Divine Light Sword Intent, with a silver radiance sweeping out with boundless sword aura rising. He first shattered the ‘Ming’ word before flicking his wrist and eighty-one sword rays bloomed like flower petals, causing space to overlap as the petals intertwined.

His sword created a hole in the Azure Glory Saint Sovereign’s shoulder, causing the latter to take a few steps back and not get close to Lin Yun.

“That’s Sword Domain!” Everyone who saw this was dumbfounded. After all, Lin Yun had not only grasped the Divine Light Sword Intent but also possessed the complete Sword Domain. This surprised the Azure Glory Saint Sovereign, and he suffered a huge loss.

“Let me see what other tricks you have!” The Azure Glory Saint Sovereign ignored his injuries. He pushed his cultivation to the limit, bearing the sword rays in Lin Yun’s Sword Domain, before forcibly shattering Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon Sword Domain.

Lin Yun’s cultivation might be lower than the Azure Glory Saint Sovereign’s, but the Divine Light Sword Intent was powerful, leaving ten-odd wounds on the Azure Glory Saint Sovereign’s body. But the latter didn’t care about his injuries. They were all worth it if he could shatter the Sword Domain. As long as he could get close to Lin Yun, he would be able to kill him with one finger.

Once the Sword Domain shattered, Lin Yun was now powerless before him. But even in the critical moment, Lin Yun’s face was terrifyingly calm as he calculated the distance between him and the Azure Glory Saint Sovereign. When he was sure that the Azure Glory Saint Sovereign was so close that he couldn’t avoid his attack, eight paintings of primordial ominous beasts opened behind him, before combining into a bigger painting, giving off a powerful aura.

A terrifying pressure swept out, making the Azure Glory Saint Sovereign’s hair flutter. As a violent gale howled, the Azure Glory Saint Sovereign couldn’t take another step forth, even if he wanted to.

The Azure Glory Saint Sovereign realized something, but he still gritted his teeth because he could kill Lin Yun if he could take another step forward.

Lin Yun’s eyes radiated with murderous intent as he roared, accompanied by a dragon’s roar, a phoenix’s cry, and a sword vibration. A sword appeared above the eight ominous beasts. That was his Sovereign Constellation, Heaven Burial. Without any hesitation, Lin Yun swung his sword.

“No!” The Azure Glory Saint Sovereign’s face changed. He could only instinctively raise his hands above his head. He managed to clamp onto the Flower Burial Sword with two palms, but the power of the sword aura was too powerful and completely suppressed his cultivation as a Saint Sovereign. This caught him by surprise since he never expected that Lin Yun would not only grasp the Sword Domain but also possess a Sovereign Constellation.

With a loud explosion under the Sovereign Constellation’s pressure, the Azure Glory Saint Sovereign fell onto his knees. His face was ugly, while his hands were clamped onto the Flower Burial Sword.

Lin Yun exerted more strength, but his sword couldn’t move another inch. The surroundings fell silent, with everyone shocked and their mouths wide open. This was a shocking scene because a Saint Sovereign was kneeling before a young Sword Saint.

Lin Yun took a deep breath, sensing the power that was coursing through his body and the connection with the Sovereign Constellation. A murderous intent flashed within Lin Yun’s eyes as the starlight shone down from beyond the thirty-six layers of heaven.

Lin Yun and the Azure Glory Saint Sovereign pushed themselves to the limit. If Lin Yun couldn’t kill the Azure Glory Saint Sovereign, the latter could kill him with an attack at such a close distance. Even if he weren’t dead, he would be left heavily injured.

In the history of the Kunlun Realm, there hadn’t been a second-stage Saint Lord who could safely escape from a fight with a Saint Sovereign.

Everyone in the surroundings became nervous, and even the surrounding battles paused from the shock as they looked at Lin Yun with disbelief.
