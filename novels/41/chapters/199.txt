Chapter 200 - What's come will come

Scattering fertilizer? Li Wuyou’s eyes bulged out like a goldfish. He couldn’t believe that he had to scatter fertilizer the moment he arrived. Even Lin Yun furrowed his brows at this and quickly glanced at the field. He couldn’t imagine how tired he would be after scattering fertilizer for the entire field.

“What’s the matter? You don’t want to?” Niu Bingshun gave a weird laugh and took a step forward, releasing his aura. His aura came crashing down on Lin Yun and Li Wuyou, suppressing them both.

Li Wuyou was shocked to discover that Niu Bingshun was in the third stage of the Profound Martial Realm. With his cultivation, he could be considered a senior disciple in the Sword Firmament Pavilion. It wasn’t clear why someone like him would get sent to Herbal Peak.

As for the people behind Niu Bingshun, they all had sinister expressions on their faces. All of them were at least in the Profound Martial Realm.

“Big Brother, what are we going to do now?” Li Wuyou panicked a little and quietly retreated behind Lin Yun. He still hadn’t reached the Profound Martial Realm yet. There was no way he could compete with Niu Bingshun alone, let alone his many helpers.

Without changing his expression, Lin Yun asked, “Is there anything that we have to do besides scattering fertilizer?”

“Hmph, at least you have tact. Besides handling the fertilizer, you also have to wash our clothes. If you have extra time, you’ll also help us get rid of the weeds and loosen the earth.” Niu Bingshun said with his arms folded together. It was rare to have rookies at Herbal Peak, so he naturally had to make good use of them.

“Then what will you be doing?” Lin Yun asked, narrowing his eyes into slits.

“Me? I’m naturally responsible for supervising the two of you. After all, I’m responsible for this herbal field,” chuckled Niu Bingshun.

“Understood. In other words, you won’t be doing anything,” said Lin Yun.

“Hahaha, that’s right. You daddy won’t be doing anything,” Niu Bingshun laughed. His laughter also attracted the laughter of those standing behind him. Waving his hand, Niu Bingshun slapped Lin Yun, “What’s the matter? You’re not happy with the arrangements? Well, it doesn’t matter if you’re unhappy, it sucks to suck!”

He could tell that Lin Yun and Li Wuyou weren’t going to be obedient, but that didn’t matter. There was no place for them in this herbal field. But right before his hand reached Lin Yun, a bolt of lightning flashed past his eyes.

To be exact, it was Lin Yun’s hands that were moving like lightning. Before Niu Bingshun could react, Lin Yun grabbed onto his wrist and applied pressure. The pain of his wrist being crushed made Niu Bingshun cry out in pain. His robust figure was like a little lamb that collapsed to the ground.

“I-I-It hurts… Please let me go. I won’t force you guys to do anything,” pleaded Niu Bingshun.

Lin Yun loosened his grip and Niu Bingshun staggered backwards.

“Big Brother!” The other disciples with the prisoner uniforms came over to help Niu Bingshun to his feet.

“Go! All of you go! I want him dead!” Niu Bingshun roared furiously. Upon receiving his orders, the group immediately charged at Lin Yun. The rules of Herbal Peak forbade the use of swords, so they charged at Lin Yun with their fists.

“Fighting bare hands?” Lin Yun smiled. He had the Thunderblitz Battle Physique and the Dragon-Tiger Fist, not to mention that his body was brought to a whole new level after he made his breakthrough into the Profound Martial Realm. If they were going to fight bare handed, none of them would defeat him.

The Iris Flower bloomed in Lin Yun’s Dantian as he executed the Undying Vajra Seal. Releasing an unstoppable momentum with his hands, Lin Yun charged into the crowd. A messy fight broke out that injured many people. Lin Yun was facing Profound Martial Realms, so he couldn’t just take them down with a single fist.

Nevertheless, Lin Yun had achieved his goal. As long as none of them ran, Lin Yun could just go up and beat them down easily without any pressure. He smashed his fist against the face of the person who was rushing towards him.

Under the explosive power of the Dragon-Tiger Fist, no one was his match. After about seven to eight punches, the group that charged Lin Yun was lying on the ground, crying out in pain. The others trembled as they watched from a distance. Their courage disappeared and they hid behind Niu Bingshun.

When Niu Bingshun saw this scene, his face turned grave. The origin energy within his body rumbled as he activated his three profound veins, releasing an oppressive aura.

“If I don’t beat you down today till you beg for mercy, I won’t be able to stay in this herbal field anymore.” He rushed towards Lin Yun right after he spoke. The power coming from his body rumbled like a mountain, making Lin Yun, who had yet to form his first profound vein, feel some pressure.

“Looks like he isn’t a pushover,” said Lin Yun.

He could tell that Niu Bingshun was pretty powerful. Even Huangfu Jingxuan wouldn’t be able to defeat Niu Bingshun. However, it was a pity that he was facing Lin Yun, who grasped the complete sword intent. A buzzing sword ring echoed out from Lin Yun’s body, piercing through Niu Bingshun’s aura.

Niu Bingshun sensed that something was amiss, but it was a little too late. Lin Yun was already in the air, executing the Flying Dragon, Leaping Tiger. The punch that he unleashed was like a dragon that was accompanied by an echoing tiger roar. Taking the hit, Niu Bingshun vomited a mouthful of blood and fell to the ground.

“The complete sword intent!” Niu Bingshun struggled to get up. Shock filled his eyes as he clutched his chest. The others were also taken aback. They didn’t expect that Lin Yun had grasped the complete sword intent.

“Big Brother, over here!” Li Wuyou moved a chair out from the straw shack and placed it beside Lin Yun.

Lin Yun didn’t waste time being polite and just sat down. Looking at the group that was still wailing out in pain, he casually said, “Get up. Stop pretending. I didn’t use that much power on you. In fact, all of you are in the Profound Martial Realm, so stop pretending to be weak.”

His words instantly made those lying on the ground feel embarrassed. They stood up and dusted themselves off. Niu Bingshun looked at them and cursed. This group of bastards actually pretended to be dead the moment they met someone tough. If they had fought as a group, Lin Yun wouldn’t be sitting there.

But he knew that there was no way he could count on people who were punished at Herbal Peak.

“You, come here and tell me more about Herbal Peak,” said Lin Yun, pointing at Niu Bingshun. When he discovered that Lin Yun possessed the complete sword intent, Niu Bingshun instantly knew that there was no way he could defeat Lin Yun.

Although he was unhappy, he bit the bullet and walked over. After some explanation from Niu Bingshun, Lin Yun and Li Wuyou finally understood what kind of place Herbal Peak was to the Sword Firmament Pavilion. As one of the four transcendent sects in the Great Qin Empire, the Sword Firmament Pavilion naturally occupied a treasured land.

Herbal Peak was built on top of this treasured land to grow spiritual herbs. The Herbal Hall was a subsidiary hall managed by the Pellet Hall, so it did not have a high position. Disciples who were sent here were either senior disciples who made mistakes or those who had been eliminated. In a nutshell, these people did not have any background or talent, but they didn’t want to leave the Sword Firmament Pavilion.

According to Niu Bingshun, someone like Lin Yun shouldn’t be sent to the Herbal Hall even if he made a mistake. He should be sent to the Broken Sword Cliff to be confined. But despite being called confinement, it was actually a place for seclusion. Only those who the sect had abandoned would be sent here.

Li Wuyou sighed, “Bai Ting, that old fellow is a little too much. He sent us here for three months.”

But Lin Yun didn’t feel that it was terrible. He devoured a large amount of Yin energy back then, so he could use these three months to consolidate his cultivation. After all, the improvement in his cultivation was a little too quick as he rose from the fifth orifice of the Xiantian Realm to the Profound Martial Realm. He also needed some time to gather himself.

“Your strength isn’t bad and your origin energy is refined. You don’t seem like someone abandoned by the sect. So, what did you do?” Lin Yun asked curiously.

But just when Niu Bingshun was about to speak, someone laughed out, “Our Big Brother Niu isn’t simple. He peeked at female disciples showering and even stole a few undergarments. He’s the first person in the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s thousands of years of history to do this!” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Hahaha!” Li Wuyou laughed. He then looked at Niu Bingshun and said, “Brother, I never expected you to be such a genius.”

Niu Bingshun immediately blushed and turned around to glare at the one who spoke. He cursed in his heart, but outwardly he smiled and said, “I’m not worthy of your praise.”

“There’s nothing to be afraid of. From now on, the great task of scattering fertilizer will be handed to you.” Li Wuyou patted Niu Bingshun’s shoulder.

When Niu Bingshun heard this, his face instantly turned black. He tried negotiating with a bitter smile, “T-t-this… I can get someone else to do it instead. I’m experienced here and I can be on standby if the two of you need anything.”

“No need. We’ll leave you with the fertilizers. The two of us will take over what you’ve been doing in the past.” Lin Yun waved his hand.

Niu Bingshun immediately burst into tears inside his heart. He didn’t have to do anything in the past. He initially thought that he had two rookies he could take advantage of, but they turned out to be wolves instead! Not only did they rob him of his position, but they even wanted him to handle the fertilizer.
