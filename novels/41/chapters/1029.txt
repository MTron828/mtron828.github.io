Chapter 1030 - Decisiveness of the Realm Sons

Just like that, the generals from the Elysium Trigram, Nether Divinity, and Profound Dragon War Realms were all killed. As of this moment, the altar was dyed in blood, proving that many people had died.

Everyone looked at Lin Yun with fear and disbelief because his aura was too terrifying. They couldn’t believe that Lin Yun still killed the head generals after the Realm Sons spoke up. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Lin Yun!” A roar sounded out from afar. The angry voice naturally belonged to the Realm Sons. They were emitting a terrifying light from afar as they looked like three comets blazing through the sky.

Their dazzling brilliance emitted a terrifying aura. On top of that, they had a boundless chill that expressed their rage and killing intent. Their hatred for Lin Yun was clear since they were forced to watch Lin Yun kill their generals.

Lin Yun turned his head over and saw the Realm Sons coming for him. He could sense their killing intent that was increasingly growing.

Suddenly, a series of explosions took place around the altar that left many people shocked. Could it be that the Realm Sons were already here? Shortly after thinking this, the crowd realized that it was a battle between Lin Yun’s killing aura and the Realm Sons’ killing aura.

“You imbecile, you’re dead! No one can save you in the Heavenly Path no matter where you hide!” The voices of the Realm Sons grew louder as they got closer.

Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with indifference as he replied, “What an arrogant tone. I’ll be waiting for you guys at the end of the Heavenly Path! One day, everyone will know that the Realm Sons mean nothing to me!”

His arrogant tone left everyone dumbfounded. After all, no one had ever said such words towards the war realms. However, since both sides had an irreconcilable feud, it didn’t matter if Lin Yun offended them even more. After all, how could he be a sinner if the Azure Dragon True Bone was gifted to him?

He had risked his life to obtain the Azure Dragon True Bone, so how could he possibly give it away for free just because they were the Realm Sons? Furthermore, he was certain that these three war realms were pursuing Yue Weiwei, so he naturally had no reason to let them go.

Shortly after, Lin Yun found Pei Xue from within the crowd, grabbed her, and executed the Golden Crow Nine Transformations to escape. He had exhausted a great deal of his strength against the generals, so he wouldn’t foolishly face the Realm Sons.

As the seals in Lin Yun’s hands changed, a pair of brightly shining golden wings appeared behind him. With a flap of his wings, Lin Yun disappeared. No one could believe that Lin Yun had such a powerful movement technique that he was able to manifest a pair of wings.

“Let’s go. There’s no need to stay here anymore!”

“The lockdown is broken! I can’t believe those bastards trapped us here for a month!”

“I bet the expression of the three Realm Sons will be intriguing to watch. It’s a shame that we won’t get to see it.” Everyone recovered from their shock. The generals were killed, which meant that the lockdown was destroyed. Instantly, the crowd rejoiced and charged towards Four Phase City. Then again, there were those who wanted to stay behind to look at the expressions of the Realm Sons.

But when they thought of the possibility that the Realm Sons might vent their anger on them, they quickly left. Just like that, everyone ran away from the bloody altar in the blink of an eye.

An hour later, the entire region lit up with a dazzling radiance. Those who were heading towards Four Phase City instantly had fear on their faces. They didn’t dare to show themselves before the Realm Sons, so they ran away. “They’re here!”

Three figures enveloped in light were creating spatial fluctuations because of their emotions. Their powerful aura shook the heavens and earth.

The Elysium Trigram, Nether Divinity, and Profound Dragon Realm Sons had arrived. When they looked into the horizon, they saw a golden figure with wings on his back bolting towards Four Phase City with a woman.

They were surprised because they recognized the Sun Chasing Art. Looking at Lin Yun disappear from view, the Nether Divinity Realm Son sighed, “We can’t catch up…”

There was no way they could catch up to Lin Yun. Even if they managed to catch up, Lin Yun would have reached Four Phase City. Although their faces were dark with anger, they did their best to suppress their emotions. They planned to trap Lin Yun and suppress him, so they never expected to lose all of their servants.

The reality of the situation was harsh. Lin Yun was happily alive while the servants of the war realms were dead. It was a resounding slap to their faces that would haunt them for ages.

Just like that, the three of them quietly watched Lin Yun run away. Not only did they suffer a great loss, but they also failed to obtain the Azure Dragon True Bone and Divine Blood Fruit!

“Let’s leave him be. He’ll show up before us sooner or later,” said the Nether Divinity Realm Son.
