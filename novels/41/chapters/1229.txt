Chapter 1230 - Competing With The Moon

Even if he could sense that something wasn’t right, he didn’t think too much about it. The other party was unbelievably fast, and the crimson moon seemed to have a hidden effect.

If it wasn’t for Lin Yun’s powerful sword intent it would have been impossible for him to even detect Xiahou Jue’s location. Without any hesitation, Lin Yun executed the Golden Crow Nine Transformations and charged forward like a ferocious beast. He left behind afterimages as he moved too fast to be seen.

Under the crimson moon, the crowd could barely see figures colliding on the stage.

In the blink of an eye, the two had already exchanged over ten-odd moves.

Jiang Lichen and the rest were shocked by Lin Yun and Xiahou Jue’s speed. With their eyesight, they could barely catch the silhouettes. When a collision sounded out, the surface of Lin Yun’s body radiated with purple-golden light and his figure was forced to appear while Xiahou Jue took several steps back.

“Azure Dragon Saint Physique?” Xiahou Jue squinted his eyes looking at the runes on the surface of Lin Yun’s body before he continued coldly, “You’ve really hidden well. But there’s no way you can last long in front of my Venom Dragon Claw!”

When Xiahou Jue was done talking, his face became even darker as he charged toward Lin Yun. A crimson dragon manifested behind Xiahou Jue and a crimson dragon claw shrouded in demonic aura flew all over the stage. Lin Yun didn’t dare to take a whiff and closed his pores because he knew that it must be poisonous.

“Brat, you’re really cautious. But you’ll lose sooner or later if you’re just being cautious!” Xiahou Jue smiled and his eyes suddenly became sharp.

Instantly, Lin Yun felt that something wasn’t right. But before he could think more about it, Xiahou Jue’s aura suddenly exploded and reached the height of the quasi-Elysium Core Realm. He didn’t have any reservations and released his cultivation in the quasi-Elysium Core Realm. Unbelievably, his aura was even comparable to lesser Elysium Core Realm experts.

Lin Yun was one step slower and his sword aura was instantly restricted. Although it only lasted for a brief moment, this flaw was captured by Xiahou Jue.

With a cold snicker, a dragon manifested behind Xiahou Jue and overlapped with his body. He swung his hand down to take Lin Yun’s head. If Lin Yun took this attack head-on, his entire head would be destroyed.

Lin Yun squinted his eyes and instantly saw that this was a fake move. At the same time, there were several images flashing before his eyes. He could tell that the real attack was after this. In the blink of an eye, Lin Yun made the choice and avoided this claw, and Xiahou Jue’s other hand that was hidden behind him was aimed at Lin Yun’s shoulder.

His attack instantly left a bloody hole on his shoulder, and Lin Yun was sent flying from the immense power. When Xiahou Jue’s attack connected, his quasi-Elysium Core Realm aura continued to soar.

“Do you understand why I’m confident about winning? Even lesser Elysium Core Realm experts are nothing before me. So who the hell do you think you are?” Xiahou Jue spread his arms apart and soared into the sky. His gaze was red like a demon as he dove down towards Lin Yun.

When the two of them collided, everyone took in a cold breath. At the same time, they knew how terrifying Xiahou Jue was to injure Lin Yun so easily.

“Quasi-Elysium Core Realm! His aura is too powerful!”

“Lin Yun’s sky sword intent doesn’t seem strong before it…”

“No wonder he’s a genius ranked in the top 3,000…”

Looking at this scene, the faces of those from the Fleeting Cloud Sword Realm changed. They were confident in Lin Yun, especially in the power of Lin Yun’s sword aura that made them feel despair. But no one expected that Xiahou Jue would be so terrifying with the huge advantage in his cultivation.

This instantly rendered Lin Yun’s sword intent useless, not to mention that sword intent was Lin Yun’s strongest trump card.

“Not good! Junior Brother Lin is poisoned…” Feng Zhang exclaimed. He could see that as Lin Yun dodged, his lips had turned black-purplish.

“That attack from earlier!” Ye Ziling said with her brows locked together. That attack earlier had pierced through Lin Yun’s right shoulder. Did Xiahou Jue poison Lin Yun through that attack?

“Not that attack but the crimson moon. This martial technique is really bizarre.” Luo Hua’s voice sounded out, and her words instantly made everyone’s faces change because even Ye Ziling said that it was a bizarre martial technique.

“Hehe. Senior Brother Xiahou is really strong to let that brat suffer such a huge loss in just a few exchanges!” The disciples of the Crimson Moon Elysium began to smile when they saw this scene.

“Don’t look down on Lin Yun too much. That fellow’s physique is really strong and so is his vitality. It’ll take about four hours for him to die from the poison, and it’s impossible for him to be threatened by the poison in such a short period of time. I’m worried that he made preparations beforehand,” said an elder of the Crimson Moon Elysium.

“So what? As long as he can’t break through, his sword intent will never be able to shine. In the end, he will still die,” said the Grand Elder, Chen Mu. Based on the disdain on his face, he clearly didn’t place Lin Yun in his eyes.

“Of course. How can the secret technique of our Crimson Moon Elysium be so easily resolved? Even if it’s really resolved, Xiahou Jue still has a lot of other means,” said another elder.

“Lin Yun, how does it feel?” Xiahou Jue smiled with his eyes squinted looking at Lin Yun. But his gaze made everyone who saw it feel a chill down their spines.

“Not bad, I guess,” smiled Lin Yun while he shrugged his shoulders. But the chill and sharpness in his eyes were something that he didn’t show when he challenged the three arrays in the Sword Assembly.

“Haha, I don’t believe you have a solution. The stronger your sword intent, the stronger the poison will become. This poison is called Bloodborne, and it’ll use you as nourishment the moment it sticks onto you. It's especially fond of martial intent.” Xiahou Jue snickered. “I wonder if you will have any other means after your sword intent is crippled?”

“Won’t you know if you give it a try?” Lin Yun said.

“You really think I don’t dare? You’re nothing but a fish on the chopping board!” Xiahou Jue laughed before he charged forward, leaving behind a streak of afterimages in his path. His tone was filled with arrogance, but he cautiously made his move.

“Saint Blood Dragon!” But when he was about to get close to Lin Yun, torrential crimson light shined out of his body and Xiahou Jue’s body began to swell swiftly under the crimson light. It didn’t take long for his body to burst out of his clothes with scales appearing on the surface of his body.

The crimson dragon scales looked like armor as it flickered with a metallic luster. When the dragon scales appeared, Xiahou Jue clenched his fist together and emitted an unprecedented crimson luster that outshined the crimson moon in the sky. The dazzling brilliance even made the audience exclaim.

“Senior Brother is too cautious to use the Saint Blood Dragon when he had such a huge advantage!” When the disciples of the Crimson Moon Elysium saw this scene, their mouths were wide open. After all, they didn’t doubt that Xiahou Jue could defeat Lin Yun if he wanted to.

“Let me see what other trump cards you have. Otherwise, you can die peacefully!” Xiahou Jue raised his head to glare at Lin Yun before he charged forward.

When the violent gale blew towards Lin Yun, air pressure hit his cheeks. From the air pressure alone, one could see how strong this attack was. It also made Lin Yun sigh inwardly. When he raised his head to look at Xiahou Jue again, his cold pupils were shining with a sharp light.

In the next moment, a Golden Crow and Silver Phoenix flew out of his body. As the golden and silver light radiated with heaven and earth, the Golden Crow manifested the sky and the Silver Phoenix manifested the earth.

Suddenly, Lin Yun reached out into the air and clenched his fist together, causing space to distort. But within his grasp, the sky and earth were like two paintings being grasped into his hand.

“Divine Solar Lunar Fist—Heaven and Earth Unite!” As light circulated, Lin Yun looked like a deity walking out of the sun and standing on a silver lake. Facing Xiahou Jue’s attack, he threw his punch out.
