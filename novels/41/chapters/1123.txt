Chapter 1124 - Recite My Name! (1)

Leng Aoran revealed a devilish smile under the crimson moon that made everyone feel a chill run down their spines. Even Yan Teng’s group became serious at this scene.

“Watch out!” Yan Teng suddenly yelled. When he was done, Leng Aoran swung his sword. Only Yan Teng could respond in time. However, his punch was instantly resolved by Leng Aoran with a simple swing of the sword.

In the next second, Leng Aoran appeared before Yan Teng. After resolving Yan Teng’s punch, he used his sword ray to leave a blood mark on Yan Teng’s body. Yan Teng was already quickly retreating, but he still suffered a wound to his right shoulder and revealed a painful expression.

“Divine Demon Subduing!” Xuan Fei charged over with his staff. It seemed like he could level a mountain with his staff.

It was a ferocious attack, but Leng Aoran unleashed a crimson beam that knocked Xuan Fei’s staff away.

Then, sword rays broke through the layer of clouds and bolted towards Leng Aoran’s neck. Leng Aoran merely smiled before he turned around. Before Lei Lan could get close to him, his sword ray turned into a crimson dragon that sent Lei Lan flying.

“Die!” When Yan Teng landed on the ground, he disregarded his injury and threw another punch at Leng Aoran.

Again, Leng Aoran stabbed his sword to face Yan Teng’s attack. Under a huge explosion, Yan Teng was forced to take several steps back before he finally managed to stabilize himself.

“Hahaha! You guys are too tender!” Leng Aoran sneered. He didn’t want to give the three of them any more opportunities, so he unleashed his terrifying aura.

The crowd was shocked that Leng Aoran could suppress the geniuses of three major sects all by himself. However, it made sense since Leng Aoran’s sword aura fused with his baleful aura and thunder intent. Plus, he had pinnacle spiritual sword intent.

The combination of all three manifested a vivid dragon aura that was terrifying. So in less than an hour, he left Yan Teng’s group with many injuries. Meanwhile, he was full of smiles.

Is he really in the Galaxy Stage? Everyone was dumbfounded because their cultivation level wasn’t that far off from Leng Aoran’s cultivation. However, there was still a huge difference in their strengths. Most importantly, Leng Aoran didn’t look a day older than thirty. This meant that the rumors might be true and he was once the disciple of a powerful sect in the Ancient Barren Domain.

“Sky Shattering Nine Dragons!” Unleashing a sword ray, Leng Aoran’s attack manifested into a crimson ocean. When the sword ray bloomed, nine dragons broke out from the surface of the ocean and sent Yan Teng’s group flying.

When the three of them landed on the ground, their faces were terrifyingly pale and blood dripped from their lips. Raising their heads to look at Leng Aoran once more, their eyes were filled with dense fear. They now knew why Leng Aoran could escape under Ye Ziling.

So it turns out that Leng Aoran’s strength had already exceeded their imagination, and even an Astral Stage expert might not be able to be his opponent. There were many geniuses who fled after watching the battle. As for those who stayed behind, they retreated a safe distance away from the fight.

“Looks like the three major sects have declined. I haven’t even warmed up.” Leng Aoran looked at Yan Teng’s group of three with ridicule. Humiliating core disciples was his greatest hobby, especially when he saw the fear in their eyes.

But something seemed to be different about this situation because he didn’t see any signs of panic. Do they have a trump card? Wearing a smile, Leng Aoran became even more interested.

“You’re strong.” Yan Teng wiped the blood off his lips and sneered, “If I didn’t have a trump card, I'd probably be begging you to spare me by now. Either way, you’re going to die today!”

Yan Teng tapped his interspatial pouch and took out a gorgeous silver spear that emitted a charming luster. When he held onto the spear, a boundless saint glory soared into the sky and broke through the crimson sky. Instantly, the moon went back to silver.

Looking at the long spear in Yan Teng’s hand, everyone’s jaws nearly dropped off because they could tell that it was a saint artifact. It seemed like the saint artifact Imperial Hook that belonged to the King Suspend Palace. The tip of the spear was similar to a fish hook, which was how it gained its name.

Even in the Ancient Barren Domain, saint artifacts were extremely rare. So everyone was shocked to see Yan Teng pull out a saint artifact. Even Leng Aoran felt his blood boil as he had finally baited a big fish.

“Kill him!” Yan Teng held onto the spear and charged towards Leng Aoran without any emotions in his eyes. In his eyes, Leng Aoran was already a dead person when he brought out the saint artifact. Stabbing the spar forward, a torrential saint aura surged and restricted the baleful aura around Leng Aoran.

The crimson baleful aura went back into Leng Aoran’s body, alleviating the pressure on Xuan Fei and Lei Lan. They quickly unleashed their holy spirits once they were no longer restricted. Leng Aoran had to admit that the pressure from the saint artifact was a huge problem for his movement technique, astral energy, sword intent, and baleful aura.

However, he didn’t think much of it and summoned his crimson dragon holy spirit. When the three holy spirits clashed in the courtyard, the shockwave from the collision destroyed the entire Qiu Clan’s residence.

Suddenly, the spear in Yan Teng’s hand suddenly radiated with brilliant silver color from the densely-packed saint runes. Then, a silver beam shot forth and collided with Leng Aoran’s body, instantly creating a bloody hole in his body.

“Hmph! Serves you fight for trying to fight me!” Yan Teng snickered when he saw this scene.

Simultaneously, Xuan Fei and Lei Lan’s attacks also landed on Leng Aoran, causing Leng Aoran to spit up even more blood. The crowd was shocked when they saw the power of the saint artifact.

Leng Aoran lost his advantage as soon as Yan Teng brought out the saint artifact. So the crowd couldn’t help but wonder how powerful the spear would be in Chu Tianhao’s hands. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Yan Teng maintained an indifferent expression with killing intent flashing through his pupils. When Leng Aoran was sent flying by Xuan Fei and Lei Lan, saint runes began to shine on the spear as over 50 saint runes were activated in the blink of an eye. When the saint runes lit up, the spiritual energy in the atmosphere began to start pouring into the spear.

When the spear was done accumulating spiritual energy, Yan Teng stomped his foot on the ground. Cracks spread like cobwebs underneath his foot as he shined like a bright moon. After 100 saint runes lit up, a terrifying aura swept out and left the crowd dumbfounded.

At this moment, they finally had a distinct understanding of the power of the saint artifact!

“This game has come to an end!” Brandishing the silver spear in his hand, Yan Teng disappeared before everyone. When he reappeared, he was already on the ground emitting silver light. At this moment, his spear had broken through layers of crimson light.

Crimson dragons were wailing as they were destroyed by Yan Teng’s astral energy. Then, Yan Teng pointed his spear at Leng Aoran’s heart.

Is he about to die? The crowd wondered if the infamous demonic cultivator of the Profound Azure Manor was about to be killed. Although it felt unrealistic, the power of the saint artifact exceeded their wildest imaginations.
