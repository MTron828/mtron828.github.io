Chapter 1083 - Sorry, But I Can’t Do That

It was an extremely anticlimactic battle as Lin Yun killed the Realm Sons with a single sword. It didn’t matter that they reached the seventh soul Heavenly Soul Realm, they couldn’t even leave a trace of their existence behind. At this moment, Lin Yun had become a legend in the Heavenly Path as the swordsman with the strongest sword intent, sword, and sword technique.

The Nether Divinity Realm Son’s party hid in the Saint Spiritual Lake because they thought that no one would discover them. They were confident in their plan to wait for the battle to end before making a move. Unfortunately, their plan wasn’t perfect. There was no way that Lin Yun would forget about them. After all, he wasn’t here to become the champion but to kill those three Realm Sons.

He could never forget about their grudge. First, they set up a trap for him in the Yellow Sandy Plain. Then, they humiliated Yue Weiwei in the Demon Slaughtering Assembly. Since they dared to provoke him time and again, he had to repay them with death.

“H-how is this possible?” The Imperial Feather Realm Son who was on the verge of death couldn’t believe this scene. He already suffered a huge mental blow when Lin Yun defeated the five realm sons with the Iris Sword Array, so this scene thoroughly humiliated him.

Lin Yun could’ve easily defeated him, but Lin Yun didn’t want to bother going through so much trouble. This realization made the Imperial Feather Realm Son feel even more despair than before. He kenw that Lin Yun was strong after the sword array, but he didn’t know the limit of Lin Yun’s strength until now. If Lin Yun bothered to take out his sword earlier, he would have died an instant death.

With Lin Yun’s unrivaled sword intent, sword, and sword technique, who else could pose a threat to him? Only the elders could stop his sword. When the Imperial Feather Realm Son thought about Lin Yun, he realized how hilarious the Realm Sons’ competition was.

He was filled with disdain when he heard about the rumors that Lin Yun only needed one sword to kill an individual, but he turned out to be the fool. All he could do was bitterly smile.

He had great talent. Plus, he underwent great dangers to merge with the Flame Dragon’s Heart. The fact that he could make it through the fusion process proved that he was a lot stronger than the other Realm Sons. His talent wasn’t any weaker than Lin Yun. In fact, he was even stronger than Lin Yun because of his foundation.

So if Lin Yun wasn’t around, he would have definitely been the last one standing. Suddenly, a sad truth dawned on the Imperial Feather Realm Son. If he didn’t steal Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon True Bone, Lin Yun’s sky sword intent would only be at greater mastery and his attainment in the sword path wouldn’t be so strong.

The loss of the Azure Dragon True Bone allowed Lin Yun to experience life and death. It was a crucial part of making his sky sword intent reach complete mastery. If he didn’t dig out Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon True Bone, Lin Yun wouldn’t have made such a huge breakthrough so quickly. He should have killed Lin Yun when he had the chance.

Unfortunately for him, he couldn’t go back in time. He already lost his Flame Dragon’s Heart. Right now, he hated the fact that his foundation was too strong. If his foundation was a little weaker, he would’ve died the moment he had his Flame Dragon’s Heart extracted. Then, he wouldn’t be alive to watch Lin Yun defeat everyone else.

The crowd was still silenced by Lin Yun’s awe-mighty performance. Even the elders in the starry sky were dumbfounded. Since they weren’t ordinary people, they knew what Lin Yun’s sword intent meant as a Heavenly Soul Realm cultivator. Lin Yun wasn’t just a monstrous genius anymore.

When they recovered from their shock, the elders looked at Lin Yun with renewed interest. He displayed the talent that they came to find in the Heavenly Path. It was an unrivaled and transcendent talent. They were no longer concerned that Lin Yun’s cultivation wasn’t high. He grew up in the lower realms so he shouldn’t have much spiritual energy anyway. As long as he made it into Kunlun Realm, his cultivation will undergo a transformative boost.

“How dare you!” Suddenly, a ferocious roar filled with a boundless killing aura caused the starlight in the starry sky to crumble. It was naturally Elder Jin Jue.

The other elders watched with concern. Just a moment ago, Elder Jin jue was filled with disdain for Lin Yun. However, he was caught off guard when Lin Yun killed the three Realm Sons. Lin Yun’s sword was too fast for him to respond.

The Thunder Sect’s elder spoke up, “Jin Jue, what are you trying to do? No one can interfere in the final battle. The Heavenly Path doesn’t belong to your Profound Sky Sect!”

“Hmph, I don’t care even if he kills the other Realm Sons, but he has to pay the price for killing the Nether Divinity Realm Son. Not even the Sacred Alliance can stop me!” Jin Jue’s face was cold as he released an attack on Lin Yun without any warning.

“This old bastard!” The other elders began to start cursing when they saw this scene. If Jin Jue was really determined to kill Lin Yun without regard for the consequences, they might not be able to stop him. Who would have thought that Elder Jin Jue would be so shameless to attack Lin Yun just because things didn’t go his way.

They knew that Elder Jin Jue had interfered in the Heavenly Path,but this was the first time they had evidence of it.

“You have to get past me if you want to kill him!” Yue Weiwei appeared out of nowhere in front of Lin Yun, which distracted Elder Jin Jue. Since the Heavenly Path Mirror wasn’t as strong as before, Yue Weiwei broke through the seal in her body. Meanwhile, her aura swiftly reached the level of the Empyrean Realm.

Before Lin Yun could respond, Yue Weiwei appeared before and allowed Elder Jin Jue’s palm to land on her. Elder Jin Jue was furious because he was already annoyed with Yue Weiwei from a while ago. So he poured all of the astral energy in his body into the attack. But just when his palm was about to land on Yue Weiwei, he suddenly discovered that there was an extremely noble aura coming out of her.

It was an aura that belonged to the Heavenly Fox Clan. She was the descendant of a great demon! Elder Jin Jue’s face quickly changed as he retracted his hand. He stared at Yue Weiwei for a long time before asking, “Who is your father?”

Wearing a determined expression, Yue Weiwei replied, “My name is Yue Weiwei!”

Upon hearing that, Elder Jin Jue squinted his eyes. He instantly thought of something and felt fear because of Yue Weiwei’s surname. Even the faint aura that she was emitted made him fearful. However, when he recalled the death of the Nether Divinity Realm Son, killing intent surged in his eyes once more, “This is the Heavenly Path! You’re in no position to call the shots here. Someone has to pay the price for the Nether Divinity Realm Son’s death. You can’t stop me!”

“Let him come,” said Lin Yun without any change on his face. He had clearly expected the consequences of killing the Nether Divinity Realm Son, not to mention that he wasn’t afraid of this old bastard. He was confident that the Firmament Battle Cloth left behind by the Azure Dragon Lord would give Elder Jin Jue a huge surprise.

“No way!” Yue Weiwei roared, “I don’t want to! Just stand behind me, please. Just listen to me this once. I don’t want to see Big Brother Yun suffer again when there’s something I can do about it. Just let me stand in front of you this once.”

Her face was covered in tears that made her look like a helpless little girl. However, she had no fear in her eyes. Lin Yun was shocked because he never expected that Yue Weiwei would have such a side to her.

Yue Weiwei looked at Jin Jue and mustered all of her courage, “You injured me secretly back then, but I’m willing to call it off if you let Big Brother Yun go. I beg of you not to harm Big Brother Yun!”

When Lin Yun heard that, he clenched his fist together and immense killing intent filled his eyes.

Elder Jin Jue indifferently snorted, “You beg me? I don’t care if you beg me. If you’re not willing to leave, you can die with him!”

Elder Jin Jue pushed his palm out with a power so destructive that the crowd could only watch in fear. His power far exceeded everyone’s imagination.

Lin Yun took a step forward and embraced Yue Weiwei. Looking at the girl in his embrace, Lin Yun said, “Sorry, but I can’t stand behind you.”

When Elder Jin Jue saw this scene, he rejoiced and couldn’t help smiling. He had his concerns if Yue Weiwei stood in front of Lin Yun, but Lin Yun delivered himself up instead.

However, when the palm was about to land on Lin Yun, a torrential demonic light soared into the sky. A punch collided with Elder Jin Jue that sent him flying. Blood dripped down from his lips after receiving such a strong attack.

The person who appeared had a torrential demonic aura that was targeted at Elder Jin Jue. “It looks like the Profound Sky Sect has gotten really arrogant over the last few years. You dare to touch the young miss?!”
