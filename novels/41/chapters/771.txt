Chapter 772 - Center of Attention

Those who helped Lin Yun were geniuses at the peak of the Ancient Southern Domain. They could overlook countless geniuses and it would have been easy for them to humiliate a nameless swordsman. So, their support for Lin Yun left the crowd dumbfounded.

Facing Qin Yang’s threat, Lin Yun didn’t even say a single word, which left Qin Yang in an even more awkward position. No one expected that Lin Yun’s acquaintance would be so great.

Qin Yang’s gaze was gloomy at the moment. It took him a while before he snorted and threatened Lin Yun, “You better pray you don’t run into me during the Draconic Banquet or else I’ll make you pay the price!”

Qin Yang didn’t waste anymore time and left. Lin Yun couldn’t even be bothered with replying as he looked at Qin Yang like he was looking at a clown.

“Lin Yun, you seem to know a lot of people. Even the Cloud Trigram Fairy stood up for you.” Wu Xiaotian couldn’t contain his emotions anymore after Qin Yang left. Although he was talking to Lin Yun, his gaze had been on Jiang Ziye from the beginning.

Cloud Trigram Fairy was Jiang Ziye’s title given to her four years ago. But very few people called her that in recent years since she hadn’t been in the Ancient Southern Domain. As for Wu Xiatian and Jiang Ziye’s relationship, many people knew that she defeated him with less than ten moves. In fact, this defeat had a huge impact on Wu Xiaotian and nearly drove him insane. So, there was a deep grudge between them. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Compared to Wu Xiaotian, Jiang Ziye was rather calm as she looked at Bai Lixuan, “Let’s go.”

Bai Lixuan nodded at Lin Yun before he left.

“Senior brother, let’s go.” Ji Wuye sighed as he could tell that his senior brother still hadn’t gotten over the blow he suffered four years ago. This meant that Wu Xiaotian wouldn’t fare well against Jiang Ziye.

Wu Xiaotian snorted with flames blazing in his heart because Jiang Ziye had completely ignored him. After their departures, the commotion caused by Qin Yang had finally come to an end.

“Big Brother Yun, it has been a long time.” Yue Weiwei walked over. She was filled with mystery and charm, and no one dared to look at her for long.

“Yeah. I never expected to see you at the Draconic Banquet. It looks like you’re a lot stronger than I had imagined,” smiled Lin Yun,

“Hehe, Big Brother Yun is also the same. Are you trying hard to prepare the betrothal gifts?” Yue Weiwei smiled.

Her words left Lin Yun speechless. He thought that she was joking two years ago, so he never imagined that she would remember it so well.

“Young Master Lin, I’ve heard about you from the seniors of my sect. They say that your talent in sword path is only slightly inferior compared to me, but it appears that they have underestimated you,” said Nangong Wanyu, seeing that Lin Yun was feeling a little awkward because of Yue Weiwei.

He was shocked when he saw the fireflies dancing around Lin Yun. Even he couldn’t see through Lin Yun’s unfathomable sword intent.

“You’re being too modest.” Lin Yun replied as he cupped his hands together. He could sense that although Nangong Wanyu didn’t grasp the spiritual sword intent, his sword intent was also extremely terrifying like a dragon baring its fangs.

This made him curious about which path Nangong Wanyu took. Although Jiang Ziye and Wu Xiaotian had left, the meeting between Lin Yun and Nangong Wanyu still attracted many people’s attention. They were looking at Lin Yun enviously as they couldn’t figure out Lin Yun’s origin.

After all, it made no sense for someone like Nangong Wanyu to pay attention to Lin Yun. But when Nangong Wanyu looked at Lin Yun, it looked like Nangong Wanyu held Lin Yun in high esteem. Furthermore, the lady beside Nangong Wanyu left them even more envious.

After all, Yue Weiwei was a lot more beautiful than Qing Ruoyou and everyone could tell that she was well acquainted with Lin Yun. First, the greatest beauty of the Nether Prefectural City, Mo Ling went up to talk to Lin Yun. Then, someone even more charming came over. This made everyone confused as they had no idea where Lin Yun got his luck with women.

Even Yang Fan, who was rather familiar with Lin Yun, was completely dumbfounded. After all, in his understanding, Lin Yun was just an outstanding genius in the path of the sword. In contrast, Nangong Wanyu was someone who stood at the top of the pyramid that represented the geniuses of the Ancient Southern Domain.

“What an interesting brat.” Yan Long’zi looked at Lin Yun with a smile, but his gaze was terrifyingly cold. What did I just hear? Betrothal gifts?

Provoking Qin Yang was nothing, but he deemed Lin Yun a dead man since Lin Yun dared to have thoughts for Yue Weiwei. But compared to Qin Yang, he was more prideful and couldn’t be bothered with Lin Yun. He merely glanced at Lin Yun before condemning Lin Yun to death.

More people ascended the city wall and the test gradually came to an end while everyone chatted. The number of people on the river gradually decreased after four hours and those who stood on the city wall were small in number.

The genuine experts wouldn’t still be on the river as that would expend most of their origin energy. Those who weren’t able to land on the city wall at this point were basically out of luck.

The sun began to set on an empty river as the test had finally come to an end. Then, the ancient city began to tremble and the river turned into a huge dragon before coiling above the city. Simultaneously, the cracked ground began to close up. When it closed up completely, the ancient gate opened and the blue barrier shrouding it finally disappeared.

Then, all of the cultivators and elders of various sects entered the city. When they looked at those standing on the city wall, they felt their blood boil.

Lin Yun looked around the city wall and roughly estimated the numbers. There were about one hundred thousand people who participated in the test, but only ten thousand made it through. The Ancient Southern Domain was massive and it had hundreds of millions of cultivators, which really put things into perspective for the crowd.

At this moment, Lin Yun suddenly recalled that someone said it was already a victory if one could participate in this Draconic Banquet. Looking at those who were eliminated behind the city wall, Lin Yun finally understood what those words meant. Then, those who were on the city wall were joined by their sect’s elders. All of the elders had joy written on their faces as they reunited with their disciples.

It didn’t take long for the Heavenly Demon Pavilion’s elders to come and fetch Yue Weiwei. Before Yue Weiwei left, she chuckled, “Prepare your betrothal gifts, Big Brother Yun.”

Her words instantly caused the elders to glare at Lin Yun with blatant threat in their eyes.

“How terrifying.” Lin Yun muttered as he rubbed his nose. He had first-hand experience of her troubles two years ago and it seemed like nothing had changed.

“Young Master Lin’s seems pretty fortunate. I heard that she holds a special position in the Heavenly Demon Pavilion that not even the pavilion master dares to treat her lightly. You’ll be in trouble if you get too close to her.” Mo Ling smiled before she left with Liu Yunyan.

It didn’t take long for Pavilion Master Plum and those from the Great Qin Empire to gather over. The Great Qin Empire’s results were rather pathetic this time as only Feng Ye barely managed to get through the test thanks to his barbarian bloodline. This meant that Situ Yi, Aquaselenic, and Yue Qing all failed.

“Let’s go and find somewhere to stay in the city. The Draconic Banquet will be held officially three days from now,” said Pavilion Master Plum.

“Three days from now? But who will host it?” Lin Yun asked curiously. For such a grand event, there would naturally be discontent if the nine overlord forces held it. If it wasn’t held by the nine overlord forces, he couldn’t think of anyone else who had the qualification.

“Come with me.” Pavilion Master Plum smiled. “Do you remember the envoy who came to the Great Qin Empire to host the Dragon Gate competition? Those envoys are from the Sacred Alliance that control Dragoncloud City. They’re a neutral organization with their own inheritance. They don’t interfere in the Ancient Southern Domain’s affairs aside from the Draconic Banquet. Because they’re neutral, everyone accepts their identity as the hosts.”

With millions of people entering Dragoncloud City, the usually desolate city became noisy. There were many ancient structures in the city that the various disciples casually strolled past. There were also those who were drinking and speculating who would be the underdog of the Draconic Banquet.

As for the top ten, public opinion on them was more or less the same. No one came to mind that could shake the position of the three kings and seven elites. After all, every single one of them was unbelievably powerful and they left the Ancient Southern Domain a long time ago to train. So much time had passed, so no one knew how powerful they were. As for Yu Haotian’s position, the speculators were certain that he was untouchable.

When the speculators thought hard, they believed that Wu Xiaotian and Qing Ruoyou might be able to crack the top ten. The former’s performance in the beast tide was too dazzling, while the latter was from the Indigomoon Elysium. So if anyone could get into the top ten, it would be one of them.

After everyone settled into the city, Feng Ye tried to drag Lin Yun out to stroll, but he was rejected.

Just like that, three days passed in the blink of an eye. On the third day, the golden light of dawn had finally hit the ground. The start of the Draconic Banquet was here.
