Chapter 737 - Seclusion in the Mountains

After Lin Yun bid his farewell with Falling Aquatic Empyrean, he headed out of the city. But as he walked, he kept recalling the description Drifting Goblet gave him regarding that massive world, especially the last part. He couldn’t forget Drifting Goblet’s grace when he described that world.

Compared to Drifting Goblet and the world he was from, the seven geniuses were nothing. So what if Qing Ruoyou was in the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm? There’s always someone stronger out there.

At this moment, Lin Yun began to think about what he would seek in that world. He had the desire to chase after Su Ziyao, to protect her. He had the courage to face all the geniuses and the desire to let Flower Burial Sword’s name be known to all.

Just like that, Lin Yun walked while he was lost in his thoughts. When he was walking in the city, many people recognized him and their eyes flickered when they saw him. After all, who didn’t know that he had slaughtered all seven of the geniuses? But in the end, an unbelievably beautiful woman stood up for him and slapped Qing Ruoyou. Furthermore, the Indigomoon Elysium’s elders could only leave with their tails between their legs.

The shock wasn’t something they could describe with words. After all, anyone who dared to provoke the Indigomoon Elysium would be courting death in the Thunder Prefecture. Someone mustered their courage to greet Lin Yun, but Lin Yun was too deep in his thoughts and left him hanging by the side.

Gradually, people started to notice his state with killing intent flashing in their eyes. But they quickly threw the idea away. After all, who dared to touch him when not even the Indigomoon Elysium dared to? Just like that, Lin Yun left Skymound City lost in his thoughts.

Lin Yun had been thinking about his own path and his past experiences. While he was in deep thought, his aura started to change without him knowing. He was completely oblivious to everything happening around him that he left the boundary of Skymound City and arrived at a mountain.

One random day, Lin Yun suddenly woke up from his deep thoughts and his eyes flashed brightly, as if they could break through all the darkness of the world. Not chasing immortality, but chasing a dream? Then the sword in my hand won’t chase the afterlife, but the present!

Those words might seem like boasting to someone else, but at this moment, Lin Yun had given soul and life to his sword path.

“What’s this place?” Lin Yun collected himself as he looked around. He was on a mountain, but the spiritual energy here wasn’t very high. At the very least, it was incomparable to the Skymound Mountain Range. But standing here, Lin Yun’s mood was unprecedentedly serene as if he had tossed all his burdens away.

“Drifting Goblet was right. It wasn’t good for me to know too much. If I’m not bright enough, I’ll fall into the wrong path. It’s lucky that I sorted everything out,” smiled Lin Yun as he sat in a pile of rocks.

“The Draconic Banquet is three months away and I have enough time to go into seclusion once more to digest all the harvests from my battle.” Lin Yun’s eyes flickered. Through his battle with the seven geniuses, he had gained more comprehension about ‘qi’ after venting his anger. One could suffer pain, exhaustion, and grievance, but never humiliation!

His battle with the seven geniuses had tempered his fighting experience and also nourished his ‘qi’. The ‘qi’ was invisible, but it really existed. Perhaps this had something to do with why he couldn’t make a breakthrough in his sword intent. Many thoughts flashed in Lin Yun’s mind as he linked ‘qi’ with sword intent and martial techniques that he had learned. The Azure Dragon Enneaform was a body-refining technique and Lin Yun had already reached the pinnacle fourth stage with it.

So since the brimming vitality in his body was so terrifying, he was able to slay the seven geniuses. Otherwise, it would be impossible for him to fight so long even if he had a formidable sword technique.

As for the Iris Sword Sutra, it was a legendary cultivation technique that was even stronger than the Azure Dragon Enneaform. He had reached the eleventh stage in it and the quality of his origin energy was terrifying. His quality of origin energy was even stronger than those in the pinnacle Yin-Yang stage. But Lin Yun knew that it still wasn’t enough compared to people like Qing Ruoyou.

“There’s no benefit to thinking too much about this stuff. I need to digest my harvest first.” Lin Yun took out several fourth grade spiritual jades and closed his eyes. Three days passed in the blink of an eye. When Lin Yun opened his eyes, a sharp light flashed through his pupils.

“Indeed, I can only improve myself quickly in battle. The battle has allowed me to consolidate my foundation in the lesser pinnacle Yin-Yang stage.” Three days had passed and Lin Yun managed to consolidate his cultivation. However, he was still far from the greater Yin-Yang stage. After all, he had just reached the Yin-Yang stage less than a month ago.

“I can’t make any more progress in my cultivation for now. I might as well temper my Iris Sword Sutra to the pinnacle.” The amount of fourth grade spiritual jades Lin Yun had could rival an entire sect. With this many resources, he might even be able to reach the twelfth stage.

With a resolute light flashing in his eyes, Lin Yun took out piles and piles of spiritual jades before him. He took out twenty thousand spiritual jades, filling the atmosphere with spiritual energy akin to a spiritual vein.

“This should be enough.” Lin Yun muttered before he sat down. He circulated his origin energy as an Iris Flower bloomed beneath him, emitting a dazzling brilliance as it started to refine the spiritual energy. With every cycle he completed, he would extract the impurities in his body.

He was constantly refining his origin energy, allowing the sword energy flowing in his veins to become thicker. As he cultivated, the spiritual jades gradually dimmed down while his Iris Sword Sutra gradually reached the pinnacle of the eleventh stage.

Another ten days later, a blue-clothed youth carrying a bag walked through the mountain as he collected materials from demonic beasts. His cultivation was only in the third stage of the Profound Martial Realm.

“Cultivators ultimately have to travel around to cultivate. I harvested quite a bit on this trip. I should be able to exchange this stuff for a third grade pellet. Then, I should be able to reach the fourth stage!” The youth’s eyes flashed with excitement.

The youth’s name was Luo Han, an inner disciple of a nearby sect. He had reached the third stage of the Profound Martial Realm at just twenty years old with hopes of becoming a core disciple.

“Weird, why is the spiritual energy here so dense?” Luo Han looked into the distance with his eyes flickering as he could sense dense origin energy up ahead. The density of spiritual energy in the main mountain of his sect was probably only at this level.

Right at this moment, he heard a bird cry that echoed out, shocking his heart greatly as it sounded like the cry of a phoenix. Then, boundless flames soared into the sky and the outline of a divine bird could be seen flying into the distance.

“What did I just see…” Luo Han’s heart throbbed as he felt that he had encountered an opportunity. Mustering his courage, he ran towards the commotion.

An hour later, the spiritual energy grew even denser as he got closer. But when he stepped into the region, he no longer dared to take another step forward. He saw something that he would never forget in his lifetime, a pile of countless fourth grade spiritual jades and the back of an azure-clothed swordsman.

When the azure-clothed swordsman turned around, a boundless aura exploded from him and reduced the pile of used spiritual jades into ashes. Then, the swordsman’s gaze fell onto him.

Luo Han was terrified as he began to stutter, “S-s-s-senior…”

Seeing that he was about to fall on his knees, Lin Yun retracted his aura and muttered, “There are cultivators here on this desolate mountain?”Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com
