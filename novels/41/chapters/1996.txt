Chapter 1997 - Flower Burial Sword!

Xiao Jingyan approached Ye Qingtian and threw his punch out, which Ye Qingtian faced head-on. As two powerful saint auras clashed, cracks began to spread on the ground. But the surrounding ancient trees were tough, and they only rustled with their leaves falling.

Lin Yun took several steps back and knew it was right not to clash with Ye Qinghong earlier. After all, his cultivation was lacking.

Xiao Jingyan snorted and continued charging forth, unleashing the Netherworld Ghost Fire from his palm, which became even more terrifying with each attack. As the ghost fire roared, it manifested into ominous beasts that wanted to devour Lin Yun whole.

This forced Lin Yun to draw his sword. He drew an arc in the air before thrusting it at Xiao Jingyan. But Lin Yun wasn’t wielding his sword, but manipulating it through the air.

This made Xiao Jingyan frown, and his body swayed, leaving behind a few afterimages and retreating. The Flower Burial Sword left behind various afterimages as Lin Yun reached out and grabbed the sword, and thrust it at Xiao Jingyan’s eyes.

“Get lost!” Xiao Jingyan roared as he clenched his five fingers, and a black demonic radiance shot out from his body, which sent Lin Yun flying away. Xiao Jingyan was cautious by not giving Lin Yun a chance to get close and refused to clash with Lin Yun in sword techniques.

As Xiao Jingyan fought, he took full advantage of his cultivation. After clashing with Xiao Jingyan, Lin Yun noticed that Xiao Jingyan had a lot of experience in fighting with swordsmen and was proficient in dealing with swordsmen.

“Die!” Xiao Jingyan stepped forth, creating a crack a few thousand meters beneath him, and he dashed forth. His speed was too fast for the naked eyes, and the Netherworld Ghost Fire turned into two dragons that wrapped around his arms.

When a palm descended from the sky, the two dragons flew out like scissors towards Lin Yun. Although the place was vast, Lin Yun couldn't escape when facing the two dragons. The surrounding space began to distort, piquing Lin Yun’s interest when he saw this.

Even the Azure Dragon Sword Heart wasn’t effective in this isolated space. It was already too late for him to dodge this attack, so Lin Yun decided not to dodge it and faced this head-on with his two saint physiques. After the two dragons flew past, blood dripped down from Lin Yun’s lips, making Bai Qingyu’s face change with anxiety.

“Top hundredth on the King Ranking, pretty impressive. Let me experience your strength next time!” Lin Yun wiped the blood off his lips and left.

“No next time for you,” Xiao Jingyan sneered and dashed forth.

Lin Yun might seem to be escaping, but he wasn’t really escaping. Just when Xiao Jingyan’s gaze was fixed on him and was about to catch up to him, an incident occurred as Lil’ Red jumped out and took on the Ancient Dracoape form.

The Ancient Dracoape was massive, and its palm slammed against Xiao Jingyan, catching the latter by surprise. The powerful momentum made Xiao Jingyan slam into the ground with a vast crater being created on the ground, causing the surrounding ground to tremble.

When he raised his hand, Xiao Jingyan was crushed into pieces. At this moment, Lin Yun finally intended to leave and arrive before Bai Qingyu. He grabbed Bai Qingyu and threw her to Lil’ Red, yelling, “Let’s go!”

“You think you can leave?” Zhang Kui gave the order, and thirty-six experts at the pinnacle of the Nirvana Stage charged forth. When they unleashed their attacks, all sorts of phenomena appeared in the world, enveloping them.

Seeing this formation, Lin Yun couldn't face their attacks, even if his sword technique was strong. He couldn't take their attacks head-on, even with the two saint physiques. There were too many of them, and none of them were weak.

“Big Brother, I’ll cover you!” Lil’ Red took out its weapon, the Heavenly Demonic Dipper Staff. It swung the staff in one hand while protecting Bai Qingyu with the other, using its body to face the incoming attacks. Relying on its massive body and the staff, it managed to stop the attackers.

But they were elites and soon split up, forming a group of ten to chase after Lin Yun.

“Ye Qingtian, let me see how you run today!” Zhang Kui’s eyes flashed with cruelty because he didn’t believe Ye Qingtian could face ten opponents with a higher cultivation than him.

This scene made Lin Yun take a deep breath and hold onto the Flower Burial Sword with his right hand, pouring his nirvana aura into the sword. As the sword began to vibrate, Lin Yun could hear the Flower Burial Sword’s excitement, as though it was saying that it didn’t fear anyone.

Lin Yun laughed when he sensed the sword’s excitement, and he drew his sword, activating the two glory spirits. This was his strongest attack without using his Astral Sword Intent, and the power reached an unbelievable height. Lin Yun also immediately broke through the bottleneck and made a breakthrough.

When he drew his sword, the nirvana aura was converted into a sword aura with a dazzling sword ray that lit up this entire region. The ten experts didn’t dare to be careless and unleashed their attacks together. Combined, their attacks formed a massive vortex that left cracks in the surrounding space.

The surrounding trees snapped, and blood began to drip down from the trees. As the Flower Burial Sword clashed with the vortex, a powerful shockwave swept out with cracks spreading on the ground, soon reaching ten miles in radius.

As cracks spread out on the ground, the sword ray cut through the silver vortex, and Lin Yun dashed forth. All the rocks were reduced to ashes in his path, and he quickly reached the ten experts. The ten experts had just unleashed their attacks, and they were gasping for their breaths with their foreheads covered in sweat. When they saw Ye Qingtian charging over, their pupils were projected with horror and quickly tried to escape.CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

The ten of them immediately split up and ran for their lives. But before they could turn around, Lin Yun divided himself into thirteen, each afterimage swinging a sword with blood splashing. When the thirteen afterimages overlapped, Lin Yun’s surroundings were filled with mutilated corpses, and Lin Yun raised his head to look at Bai Qingyu.

Bai Qingyu was on Lil’ Red’s shoulder, and she was so terrified that she didn’t dare to say a word. It was as though she had a new understanding of Ye Qingtian. After all, Lin Yun didn’t go easy on them and mercilessly slaughtered all ten of them, there wasn’t even a complete corpse left.

When Zhang Kui saw this scene, he was dumbfounded. Is this Ye Qingtian’s true strength?

Lil’ Red was still facing twenty-odd experts, and its body was covered in wounds. It was heavily injured. Lin Yun gave up on escaping. Instead, he charged at Zhang Kui.

“Myriad Demon…” But before Zhang Kui could finish, Lin Yun executed the first sword form of the Divine Firefly Sword’s Saint Volume—Withered Tree Coming To Life. Only Quasi-Saints were qualified to practice the Saint Volume. In addition to the glory spirits, Lin Yun’s sword rays cut Zhang Kui into pieces before he even responded.

Lin Yun sheathed his sword, spread his arms apart, and landed beside Bai Qingyu. He took a pellet and shoved it in his mouth before using the fastest speed to recover his nirvana aura. He said, “Let’s go!”

Lin Yun had exhausted his nirvana aura after executing numerous attacks, and he had to recover his nirvana aura as quickly as possible. Now that he thought about it, it had been long since he used his full strength.

Without a leader, the twenty-odd experts were easily dealt with by Lil’ Red using the Heavenly Demonic Dipper Staff. This scene left Bai Qingyu stumped while riding on Lil’ Red’s shoulder.

Ye Qingtian was covered in blood, consisting of a mixture of his blood and his enemies’ blood. This made Bai Qingyu feel uncomfortable because Ye Qingtian should be a gentleman in her impression. Even if she threw a tantrum, he would only smile it off.

But Ye Qingtian now looked like a ruthless butcher, making Bai Qingyu feel a chill run down her spine. She finally understood what Ye Qingtian meant yesterday, that living in the world was a form of gentleness.

When Lil’ Red charged out of the encirclement, Xiao Jingyan’s minced meat body suddenly flew up and reconstructed. He was enveloped in a demonic radiance that looked even more terrifying than before.

Lin Yun seemed to have expected this and stood up with his sword. Seeing this, Bai Qingyu asked, “Ye Qingtian, where are you going?”

“Luring him away,” Lin Yun said.

“I’ll help you,” Bai Qingyu said.

“There’s no need, having this is enough for me.” Lin Yun pointed at the Flower Burial Sword before soaring to the sky.

This made Bai Qingyu feel disappointed because Ye Qingtian seemed to despise her.
