Chapter 928 - Might Not Be The Case!

The sound of Ma Yu’s head exploding was resounding. Under the explosion, Ma Yu’s head exploded like fireworks. No one could believe that a genius in the second soul Heavenly Soul Realm was easily killed by Lin Yun.

Even more shocking was Lin Yun’s sword intent that looked like a dragon. How powerful was Lin Yun’s sword intent that it reached such a terrifying height? When Ma Yu’s headless corpse fell to the ground, everyone turned to look at Lin Yun with disbelief.

How is this possible? He clearly hasn’t even gone through his first tribulation, but he’s still so strong. How can a Heavenly Soul Realm defeat a second soul Heavenly Soul Realm from the higher realm? Why was Ma Yu killed so easily?

Yuan Hengtian squinted his eyes as he looked at Lin Yun with surprise. Before coming, he already knew that Lin Yun’s sword intent was strong. Otherwise, Feng Wuji wouldn’t have died to one sword. But even if Lin Yun’s spiritual sword intent was strong, there had to be a limit to it.

Naturally, he thought it would be easy for Ma Yu to suppress Lin Yun. Ma Yu refined 2,000,000 astral pellets in his second tribulation, so he was far from ordinary. It far exceeded what the geniuses from intermediate realms could refine. However, Ma Yu was still killed by Lin Yun’s sword intent.

Although the boundless sword aura was slowly dissipating, the azure and purple sword rays still flickered with a cold ray. This also made all the spectators, including Zhao Feng, take a deep breath.

Initially, he didn’t believe that someone dared to challenge the higher realms and even killed three higher realms geniuses. After all, it was public knowledge that the higher realms were equivalent to the sky in the Heavenly Path. They were existences who couldn’t be provoked. However, Lin Yun had completely destroyed everyone’s perception of the invincible higher realms.

What a pity. If a genius like him manages to grow up, he might be able to shine brightly at the end of the Heavenly Path. Zhao Feng shook his head inwardly. Although Lin Yun was strong, there was no way he could escape Yuan Hengtian.

“The geniuses on the Azure Dragon Ranking can’t be provoked,” sighed Zhao Feng. He knew how terrifying the geniuses on the Azure Dragon Ranking were. His emotions also affected those around him as they looked at Lin Yun with pity.

Silence filled the deck for a long time before Yuan Hengtian spoke up, “It looks like I underestimated you. I’ve faced swordsmen in the past and there are many powerful swordsmen on the Azure Dragon Ranking. However, no one’s sword intent can compare to yours.”

But Lin Yun merely glanced at Yuan Hengtian and said, “So you’re a genius on the Azure Dragon Ranking. Greetings.”

He was only one step away from reaching the sky sword intent as his spiritual sword intent was reaching its limit. Even without the immortal azure dragon aura, he was confident that no one’s spiritual sword intent could compete with his. So Yuan Hengtian wasn’t wrong in his evaluation.

Although the Bloodbone Realm was strong in the Heavenly Path, they weren’t the strongest. So Lin Yun didn’t place Yuan Hengtian’s praise in his eyes. The reason why he greeted Yuan Hengtian was to show that he didn’t place Yuan Hengtian in his eyes.

“You’re more arrogant than I’ve heard. It looks like you don’t even place the geniuses on the Azure Dragon Ranking in your eyes,” smiled Yuan Hengtian. He was full of confidence and wasn’t enraged by Lin Yun’s attitude in any way.

“My apologies.” Lin Yun corrected, “I’m not targeting the Azure Dragon Ranking, just you. By my estimations, you’re only ranked at the bottom end of the Azure Dragon Ranking, right?”

“Lin Yun, how dare you speak to my senior brother like that!” The person standing beside Yuan Hengtian was enraged by Lin Yun’s arrogance

But Yuan Hengtian stopped him and smiled, “Let me do it. Just prevent him from escaping. Lin Yun, everyone beneath the Azure Dragon Ranking is an ant. Initially, I had no intention of dealing with you myself. After all, how would that be fair for you? But since you’re courting death, I’ll have to grant your wish!”

Yuan Hengtian wasn’t enraged and the death of his companion didn’t affect him. It seemed that the pride and confidence of a genius on the Azure Dragon Ranking was deeply engraved in his bones.

Is Yuan Hengtian personally going to make a move? All the spectators were filled with anticipation. After all, many people heard about the legendary geniuses on the Azure Dragon Ranking, but not many had seen their strength.

“No matter what, you’re going to die today!” Yuan Hengtian glared at Lin Yun as the surrounding air turned cold. As he stepped forward, the entire ship began to tremble as his weight created large waves on the river.

In the next second, Yuan Hengtian’s figure suddenly disappeared.

“What speed!” Lin Yun was shocked by Yuan Hengtian’s speed. Then again, Yuan Hengtian was far stronger than Ma Yu. It was obvious why Lin Yun felt a dangerous aura from Yuan Hengtian.

Boundless sword intent surged in the depths of Lin Yun’s eyes as his spiritual sword intent enveloped the surroundings. At the same time, Lin Yun charged forward and moved like a fish in water.

The moment he moved, a booming sound arrived as Lin Yun narrowly dodged Yuan Hengtian’s punch. But Yuan Hengtian wasn’t surprised as he smiled, “Your sword intent is pretty keen.”

However, Yuan Hengtian’s figure was blurry as if he wasn’t really there. He was using an extremely profound movement technique that was practically an advanced fortune martial technique.

His speed was even faster than Lin Yun’s Cloud Soaring Art. After ten clashes, Yuan Hengtian caught Lin Yun and threw a punch at his chest.

“You dare to be arrogant before me?” Yuan Hengtian laughed as he tried to tear Lin Yun’s sword aura apart and pierce his chest.

Based on the power behind this attack, he was confident that he could crush Lin Yun. It wouldn’t even matter if Lin Yun had pushed his spiritual sword intent to the limit. After all, the huge gap in their cultivation wasn’t easily overcome. Yuan Hengtian’s punch successfully broke through Lin Yun’s sword aura and hit Lin Yun’s chest. However, it sounded like he hit metal.

Yuan Hengtian was shocked to discover dragon runes were shattering on the surface of Lin Yun’s body and manifesting into purple lightning to envelope him. The attack that he was so confident in failed to pierce through Lin Yun’s chest. Instead, it was stopped by the mysterious dragon runes enveloping Lin Yun’s body.

Simultaneously, Lin Yun thought to himself that the geniuses on the Azure Dragon Ranking were exceptionally strong. After all, Yuan Hengtian managed to shatter the dragon runes on the surface of his body. Luckily, Yuan Hengtian failed to leave any injuries on him. Thinking quickly, Lin Yun counterattacked with a slap to Yuan Hengtian’s face and sent him flying.

This scene left everyone dumbfounded. Did Lin Yun really just slap a genius on the Azure Dragon Ranking? Everyone rubbed their eyes to make sure they weren’t dreaming.

“I don’t dare to be arrogant before you. In fact, that slap was an accident,” smiled Lin Yun as he wiped the blood off his lips. As he spoke, his shattered sword intent converged together like a painting.

At this moment, Lin Yun felt unhappy because his cultivation was too weak. The immortal azure dragon wasn’t really immortal. If Yuan Hengtian landed a few more attacks on him, he might not be able to bear it. Furthermore, it would be embarrassing if his sword intent kept getting destroyed by people.RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“It recovered?” Yuan Hengtian’s face was dark because the durability of Lin Yun’s sword intent was really terrifying. Then, a cold light flashed through his pupils as his origin energy fluctuated. “Let me see if you still can still smile after this!”

As his aura rippled out, the entire ship shook violently and the sky turned dark. Behind Yuan Hengtian, a crimson radiance started surging violently.

“Advanced fortune martial technique!” Zhao Feng’s heart began to throb violently when he saw this scene. It was a phenomenon that was similar to the other geniuses on the Azure Dragon Ranking who fought for the Glorygold Spirit.

Zhao Feng was full of fear. It was too late for him to run. If Yuan Hengtian’s attack landed, everyone would end up dying with Lin Yun.

“It’s over! Bloodbone Demon Palm!” At this moment, Yuan Hengtian’s face was so distorted that he looked like he had gone insane. Clearly, it wasn’t easy for him to execute an advanced fortune martial technique.

Yuan Hengtian had to resort to this because Lin Yun’s sword intent was really weird. He didn’t want any accidents and he definitely didn’t want Lin Yun to turn the situation around.

It’s over? I don’t think so! Lin Yun smiled, “You’re not the only one with an advanced fortune martial technique!”
