Chapter 1551 - Sect Master's Stories

After obtaining the additional sections of the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra from Martial Uncle Dustlight, Lin Yun wasn’t in a hurry to cultivate, so he came to the Celestial Observing Stage, trying to grasp the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent. Right from the start, his advantage lied in his attainments with the sword.

As for his talents in cultivation and body-refining technique, he was equal to other monstrous geniuses. But his sword intent allowed him to overlook his peers and suppress geniuses in the same cultivation as him. This also meant that it would be harder for him the further he went.

All the swordsmen in the top five hundredths on the Elysium Core Ranking had grasped the Firmament Sword Intent with strong attainment in the sword path. So it was hard for him to gain any advantage with the Firmament Sword Intent, and it was hard for his quasi-Heavenly Dome Sword Intent to suppress his opponents.

This was because his opponents would definitely find a way to become stronger after suffering a setback in their fight, such as fusing other martial intents into their sword intent or grasping rare martial intents. After all, no one was a fool, and they would try to find a solution. This was why Lin Yun had no choice but to try and grasp the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent as soon as possible.

Three days later, Lin Yun released his sword intent on the lake’s heart, which turned into a dazzling radiance and gave him an ethereal temperament and unique charm. When he opened his eyes, all the radiance disappeared.

His sword intent had improved over the past seven days, and he was closer to grasping the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent. As long as he gently pushes with his hand, he can open the gate and grasp the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent. But he faced a problem because he couldn’t reach the door no matter how much he tried.

“I am the sky, my sword as the dome, and one with the sword.” Lin Yun muttered with his brows furrowed. The comprehension of the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent was ten times tougher than comprehending the Firmament Sword Intent, and this nearly drove Lin Yun insane.

Over the past seven days, he relied on the wisp of sword ray left by Yu Qingfeng to strengthen his Firmament Sword Intent by fifty percent. But he could only accumulate and couldn’t obtain a quantitative transformation. This was like no matter how much water was in a cup, water was still water, and there were no changes to the cup.

Lin Yun raised his head to the sky. He had no idea what it meant by ‘I am the sky’ nor what it intended. He also had no idea how to split ‘Heavenly Dome’ when they were initially one and what it meant by ‘one with the sword.’

The fourteen words were like scriptures as they repeatedly revolved within his mind. When his gaze gradually blurred, he realized that the surroundings were filled with those fourteen words. It was as though he had run amok as he kept muttering to himself, and he didn’t notice that his face was becoming paler. In the end, he even threw out a mouthful of blood before losing consciousness on the lake.

“That child…” The Radiant Sword Saint and Mu Xuankong sighed when they saw this scene. They knew how tough it was to grasp the fifth-grade sword intent, and not even Dragon Pulse Realm experts were qualified to comprehend it. After all, not every Samsara Edict Realm expert could grasp the fifth-grade sword intent. But Lin Yun’s obsession with it reached an unimaginable height.

“You go take a look at him,” said the Radiant Sword Saint before he returned to Saint Mountain. He didn’t have much lifespan left, and he shouldn’t leave Saint Mountain for long.

When Lin Yun regained consciousness, four hours had already passed. When he opened his eyes, Mu Xuankong was standing before him. The latter was donned in a long robe with the edges embroidered with golden threads. He had long hair and a long beard, but his eyes were filled with vitality.

To Saints, they could easily maintain their youthful appearance as long as they weren’t reaching the end of their lifespan, it’s just that most Saints didn’t feel a need to maintain their youthful appearance.

“You’re awake?” Mu Xuankong asked.

“Sect Master!” Lin Yun was first alarmed when he saw Mu Xuankong before he rejoiced. Before he went into seclusion, he was worried about the sect master because he knew that neither the Nether Divinity Clan nor the Profound Sky Sect were pushovers.

But since the sect master was back, this meant that it had been resolved, and Mu Xuankong didn’t run into any danger. This immediately lifted his emotions and the depression of not being able to grasp the fifth-grade sword intent disappeared.

“You’re pretty optimistic.” Mu Xuankong smiled when he saw the changes in Lin Yun’s emotions.

“When did you return?” Lin Yun asked.

“Three days ago. I was with Martial Uncle, watching you using the opportunity left behind by Yu Qingfeng to comprehend sword intent. After you threw out a mouthful of blood and fainted, Martial Uncle left, and I looked after you.” Mu Xuankong smiled.

Hearing that made Lin Yun scratch his head because it was too awkward.

“Opportunities will only appear for a split second, so you can’t force it if you missed it. Put it aside for now; you’ll only be courting death if you try to force it. The cultivation of sword intent happens naturally and smoothly.” Mu Xuankong continued.

“Okay.” Lin Yun smiled. “I’ll put it aside for now.”

It was hard to say that the reason why he forcibly tried to make a breakthrough was because he was influenced by Mu Xuankong. The scene of Mu Xuankong furiously leaving the Sword Sect greatly affected him, and he naturally felt relieved upon seeing the sect master’s safe return.

The changes in his emotions were something that he couldn’t control, and he also didn’t realize that his feelings for the Sword Sect had reached an unbelievable height.

“You met Yu Qingfeng?” Mu Xuankong asked.

“Strictly speaking, no. But we have some interaction. When Tian Xuanzi tried to make a move against my back in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, he possessed my body and saved my life. He even left behind an opportunity for me, but I have no idea what the opportunity is…”

“Since it’s an opportunity left to you by the Sword Emperor, you don’t have to tell me about it.” Mu Xuankong interrupted.

“Sect Master, why did the Sword Emperor come to the Sword Sect, back then?” Lin Yun had been curious about that for a long time, but it placed him in a difficult position. This was because Yu Qingfeng was the one who sliced off the Grand Firmament and Pellet Firmament Peaks, but he had also saved his life before.

Mu Xuankong’s eyes briefly flickered before he dropped his smile. “This is related to the Divine Dragon Empire. The Nine Emperors wanted to re-establish the Divine Dragon Empire to end the Darkest Era. So they naturally had to suppress all the forces, and many holy lands became a sacrifice for that objective. The Sword Sect only lost two peaks, but many holy lands were erased. After all, some price was needed to end the old era and open a new era.”

“So the Sword Sect became the sacrifice for the new era?” Lin Yun asked. Mu Xuankong was discreet in his words, but Lin Yun wasn’t stupid, and he instantly figured it out.

The Nine Emperors had to end that chaotic era at all costs, and the Sword Sect became a sacrifice.

Nodding his head, Mu Xuankong replied, “For the Divine Dragon Empire to be established, the Nine Emperors had to gather the power of the entire Kunlun Realm, but the Ancient Barren Domain has always been the territory of the Sword Sect. The Sword Sect has existed since ancient times, so how could we submit to a newly established empire? Not only the Sword Sect but all the other ancient domains had holy lands, and there were even those stronger than the Sword Sect, also known as sovereign holy lands!

“But the Southern Emperor went to the Ancient Heaven Domain; the Buddha Emperor went to the Ancient Earth Domain; the Blade Emperor went to the Ancient Profound Domain… erasing any forces that refused to submit. The Sword Emperor came to the Ancient Barren Domain. After fighting with the sect master of that time, he sliced off the two peaks.”

Lin Yun was shocked to hear what Mu Xuankong said. After all, it was a little too shocking that the Nine Emperors suppressed nine holy lands, and there were even sovereign holy lands among them.

“The Nine Emperors might have damaged the Sword Sect’s foundation, but they did end that chaotic age. So the Sword Sect doesn’t resent the Sword Emperor.” Mu Xuankong continued. “After all, we all have a common enemy, and the Sword Sect also chose to submit in the end, heeding the Divine Dragon Empire’s orders. We also contributed our strength to suppress the fiends.”

“What happened after that?” Lin Yun asked. Judging from the current situation of the Ancient Barren Domain, there was no sign of submitting to the Divine Dragon Empire.

Mu Xuankong explained, “I know what you’re thinking. If the Southern Emperor was still alive, everyone would definitely submit. After all, the Nine Emperors were incredibly powerful, and only the Southern Emperor could be called invincible. The Southern Emperor was the one who swept the sovereign holy land in the Ancient Heaven Domain.

“After the Southern Emperor died, the relationship between the eight emperors became peculiar. At the very least, the Sword Emperor doesn’t have any interaction with the Divine Dragon Empire. In addition to all the fiends being suppressed, many ancient holy lands no longer had any revere for the Divine Dragon Empire like they used to.

“The Ancient Barren Domain might belong to the Divine Dragon Empire on the surface, but it’s not under the control of the Divine Dragon Empire. Most importantly, the Ancient Barren Domain was subdued by the Sword Emperor. So after the Sword Emperor left, the Divine Dragon Empire didn’t dare to put any ideas on the Ancient Barren Domain.”

Lin Yun sighed when he heard those words; the relationship between the Sword Emperor and Sword Sect was really complicated. But no matter what, the Sword Sect and the Sword Emperor didn’t have any feud, and he now understood why his master had no resentment for the Sword Emperor.

“I’m telling you this today so that you don’t hold any ill feelings and you can comprehend the opportunity given to you by the Sword Emperor. But the opportunity has passed, and there’s no need for you to force it.” Mu Xuankong said, looking at Lin Yun.

“I understand.” Lin Yun smiled.

“Well then, I’ll stop bothering you now. The Heavenly Pool Gathering will begin soon. So you should start cultivating.” Mu Xuankong said before leaving.Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates
