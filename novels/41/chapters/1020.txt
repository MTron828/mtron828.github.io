Chapter 1021 - Nothing Before Him!

When the gray-clothed youth was killed by Lin Yun, it caused a huge tremor in the plain. It was a shocking sight to behold four runes dyed in blood soar into the sky and explode like fireworks.

“What’s that? Is it the birth of a treasure?”

“I-isn’t that the Nether Divinity War Realm’s secret technique? The runes should be within their bodies, why did they fly out?” Those who had interacted with the Nether Divinity War Realm before instantly recognized the runes.

“My heavens, can it be that someone from the Nether Divinity War Realm died?”

“That’s probably the case. It would make no sense for the runes to leave their bodies otherwise.”

“I-isn’t that a little too unbelievable? Did someone from the Nether Divinity War Realm die?” Everyone began to speculate what was going on.

Nie Xuan, who was a few hundred miles away from the Demonic Wolf Clan, was rushing over. When he received news from his servants that Lin Yun had appeared, his face turned sinister. He knew that Lin Yun possessed the Azure Dragon True Bone and that Pei Xue had the Divine Blood Fruit. If he could capture both of them, he would receive a large reward.

He could imagine how happy the Realm Sons would be when he captured Lin Yun. But soon, his expression became emotional as he saw the bloody fireworks in the sky. The smile on his face froze as he was filled with disbelief.

He couldn’t believe that someone from the war realms died. The war realms were invincible in the Heavenly Path and no one dared to provoke them. While he thought this, a series of explosions took place as a terrifying aura caused the ground to tremble violently.

One after another, bloody runes soared into the sky and exploded. At this moment, Nie Xuan’s face was full of despair. He knew that more people from the Nether Divinity War Realm were dying. It was the most unexpected sight to behold.

However, he comforted himself because Yang Quan was still around. Yang Quan wore the Blacklight Battle Armor and was the strongest one around. Plus, the runes in his aura oceans were close to saint grade. With him around, there was no way Lin Yun could escape no matter how strong he was. Nie Xuan knew that he could count on Yang Quan.

But the moment he thought that, a terrifying aura swept out a few hundred miles. Nie Xuan knew that Yang Quan had died because the runes soaring into the sky were more brilliant than before. When Nie Xuan saw this scene, his eyes turned red as he howled, “No!”

Nie Xuan had lost all of his servants to Lin Yun. It was an immeasurable loss. When the Yellow Sandy Plain trembled, countless people raised their heads to look at the crimson sky. After their initial shock, the entire Yellow Sandy Plain fell terrifyingly silent.

They were all wondering who killed the geniuses from the war realms. Although they had their speculation, they couldn’t believe that any of this was real. Despite the news of three war realms joining hands to pursue Lin Yun, there was no news of Lin Yun’s capture. The only thing that they heard was that Lin Yun was starting a massacre of the higher realms.

Although Lin Yun killed those from the higher realms, no one thought that he would also kill those from the war realms. It was shocking that he did this, but even more shocking that he accomplished it. Clearly, the Ten War Realms weren’t invincible like everyone thought.

Meanwhile, Lin Yun slowly descended from the sky over the Demonic Wolf Clan’s territory. Pei Xue was looking at Lin Yun with shock in her eyes because Lin Yun’s invincible performance had left her dazed. At this moment, various thoughts flashed through her mind that made her heart tremble.

When Lin Yun came over, he smiled, “As you wished, all of them are dead.”

Pei Xue was left speechless when she heard that. “They were alright, but you’re a demon.”

“Then are you the temptress that seduces men?” Lin Yun smiled.

“I’ve never done anything like that!” Pei Xue retorted.

“Let’s get going. Nie Xuan should be arriving soon. Although I’m not afraid of him, it’s a hassle to deal with him.” Lin Yun could sense a powerful aura containing torrential rage speeding towards him.

Hearing Lin Yun’s words, Pei Xue nodded her head, “We can’t underestimate him because he’s one of the four generals. But aren’t you going to take the treasures? The treasures belonging to the geniuses from the war realms are extremely preci…”

Pei Xue quickly shut her mouth as she watched a despicable cat snatch up all the interspatial pouches. She had no idea when Lil’ Red started collecting them.

“Let’s go.” Lin Yun executed the Golden Crow Nine Transformations with Pei Xue and soared into the sky.

Even at this moment, Pei Xue was filled with questions, so she finally asked, “Was that really the Divine Glorymoon Fist that you used?”

She had seen Yu Haotian execute the Divine Glorymoon Fist before. It was a terrifying martial technique powered by the Phaseless Demon Art that could easily suppress Luo Chen and her. But when Lin Yun executed it, the power was on a completely different level. It was almost like a different martial technique.

Many thoughts flashed in her mind right now as she started to realize why Lin Yun risked his life to consume many Lunar Soul Herbs. The reason couldn’t be as simple as cultivating the Divine Glorymoon Fist because Lin Yun already had the Divine Glorysun Fist.

“Yes and no.” Lin Yun gave a simple reply. He was using the Divine Glorymoon Fist, but he also added in his own enlightenments from the Divine Glorysun Fist. He was completely transformed since he could bask in the radiance of a holy spirit martial technique.

With his attacks, the Divine Glorymoon Fist touched the surface of a holy spirit martial technique when used in conjunction with the Divine Glorysun Fist. He saw the path in front of him and progressed forward despite the risks.

It was a difficult task, but it brought the Divine Glorymoon Fist to a whole new level.

“Is it a holy spirit martial technique?” Pei Xue probed. This was her best guess but she wasn’t too sure about it. After all, it was practically impossible for anyone to practice a holy spirit martial technique in the Heavenly Soul Realm as it would damage one’s foundation. In terms of impossibility, it was similar to how it was practically impossible for one to grasp the sky sword intent in the Heavenly Soul Realm.

“You can look at it that way,” replied Lin Yun.

“That’s impossible! Even if you’re an extraordinary talent, there’s no way you can touch the surface of a holy spirit martial technique!” Pei Xue exclaimed.

When Lin Yun heard her words, he merely smiled and didn’t refute them. Touch the surface? He had already touched the surface. He wanted to take it one step further and actually grasp a holy spirit martial technique. He wanted to grasp the Divine Solar Lunar Fist!

“Holy spirit martial techniques aren’t something that the Heavenly Soul Realm can grasp. Maybe, just maybe, the Realm Sons can accomplish that,” sighed Pei Xue. She understood more due to her connection with the Imperial Diagram War Realm, so she knew how great the foundations of the war realms were.

“Is that so?” Lin Yun laughed when he heard that. “Since the Realm Sons are capable of accomplishing it, why can’t I?”

“You guys aren’t the same,” replied Pei Xue.

“Haha, there are opportunities all around here and anyone has the opportunity to rise. The Heavenly Path isn’t open for a single person but for geniuses of the myriad realms. The Heavenly Realm wasn’t made for only the war realms. Everyone is allowed to compete here!” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with disdain, which left Pei Xue shocked.

“Just you wait. I’ll meet with those Realm Sons when I reach the end of the Heavenly Path. When I see them, we’ll see who has the last laugh!” Lin Yun’s tone was firm. Clearly, he didn’t want to keep running away from the war realms. Did they really think that they knew everything about him just because they knew he had the Azure Dragon True Bone?

Lin Yun would let everyone know that even the Realm Sons were nothing before him!
