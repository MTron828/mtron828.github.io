Chapter 2031 - Divine Blood Fruit

When Wang Muyan’s right arm was pulled away, leaving her with only her left hand to cover her body, her face became pale. She was finally afraid at this moment, with her lips trembling.

“Ye Qingtian, the thought of taking your life has never crossed my mind!” Wang Muyan roared.

“Should I thank you for that, then? I would’ve died in Xiao Jingyan’s hands if I wasn't this strong. So how do you want me to thank you?” Lin Yun burst into laughter.

“Hmph! Don’t take it too far and force me! Otherwise, it won’t end well for you!” Wang Muyan roared.

“I know,” Lin Yun replied.

“You know?” Wang Muyan was surprised because she noticed Ye Qingtian wasn’t surprised by what she said.

“There’s a seal within your body. If you disregard your safety, I will also have to pay a price. But you can try it and bet whether I have more trump cards.”

Wang Muyan squinted her pupils and was really afraid now because she knew that Ye Qingtian wouldn’t hesitate to move when he found the opportunity. As Lin Yun exerted more force with his right hand, Wang Muyan’s arm was pulled away, completely displaying her body before Lin Yun.

“Aren’t you a swordsman? How can you do something like this!” Wang Muyan said in a trembling tone.

“That’s because you don’t understand me.” Lin Yun grabbed her last remaining clothes, scaring Wang Muyan into despair. When she felt Lin Yun’s tug, Wang Muyan panicked.

But after Wang Muyan screamed, she noticed Lin Yun had retreated, and her clothes weren’t ripped off. While she felt uneasy, a large cloak enveloped her as Ye Qingtian’s voice resounded, “So you can also be afraid. You’ve been acting all long. I’m curious about this ‘beautiful’ past you had with Ye Qingtian.”

When Wang Muyan raised her head and saw that Ye Qingtian was looking at her with a playful gaze, she was furious because there was nothing more shameful than this moment. She roared with an ancient blood moon blazing within her pupils, “Ye Qingtian, don’t be smug! You can try it and see the consequences of provoking me!”

“You don’t have to scare me. If you could use the sealed power within your body, you would’ve used it long ago,” Lin Yun said.

Wang Muyan’s face changed, and she asked, “You could’ve killed me if you wanted to. So what do you want?”

“That’s simple. I need you to swear an oath to the heavenly dao that you won’t do anything to harm Bai Shuqing and Profound Maiden Miao Yin within the Heavenly Dao Sect, and that you won’t provoke me in the future,” Lin Yun said.

“I can make the oath, but you’re also not allowed to provoke me,” Wang Muyan said.

“That will have to depend on your performance,” Lin Yun replied.

“Don’t take it too far!” Wang Muyan roared. But the moment she was done, Black Tortoise Chains flew out from Ye Qingtian and she became tied up by the nine chains. Wang Muyan was lifted into the air by the chains, and couldn’t move, no matter how she struggled.

“Ye Qingtian, what are you trying to do?!” The chains hurt as they dug into her skin, and blood appeared on her body.

“Teaching you a lesson. You don’t have the right to talk back now,” Lin Yun replied. As dazzling lightning lit up on the chains, this made Wang Muyan scream out in pain.

“Ye Qingtian! I’ll remember this!” Wang Muyan glared at Ye Qingtian, wanting to devour him.

“This is nothing compared to what you did. You don’t want to experience what Zhang Yue experienced, right?” Lin Yun asked.

Wang Muyan’s face changed, and she gritted her teeth, “Okay! I promise you!”

“Make the oath, then,” Lin Yun said.

The heavenly oath was terrifying, and no one dared to go against it within the Kunlun Realm. It was even more terrifying than Jian Jingtian’s oath. When Wang Muyan made the oath, Lin Yun removed the Black Tortoise Chains and Wang Muyan collapsed onto the ground.

“Can you let me leave now?” Wang Muyan sent a resentful look at Lin Yun.

“There’ no need to hurry.” A silver azure dragon flew out from his sword heart and dragged Wang Muyan into the air. As Lin Yun’s hands began to change, he formed an ancient seal with nether energy gathering in his palm. The Netherflower’s petals soon formed into chains that dug into Wang Muyan’s forehead, the Nether Shackles.

“What have you done?!” Wang Muyan fearfully rubbed her forehead.

“A small trick. It won’t do anything to you if you behave well. But if you dare to make a move, I’ll take your life even if heaven doesn’t!” Lin Yun coldly looked at Wang Muyan.

Wang Muyan slowly got up from the ground with an ugly face, and she gritted her teeth, “Ye Qingtian, this isn’t over!”

“That’s right. You can come at me if you want, but just don’t regret it,” Lin Yun smiled.

Wang Muyan became even more furious upon seeing Ye Qingtian’s expression, and she said, “You have no idea what you’ve done today. You have committed blasphemy against a deity and will regret it!”

After she finished speaking, she quickly covered herself with the cloak and disappeared.

“The Nether Shackles might not be able to threaten her for long. The power sealed within her body is so weird that it even made me feel afraid,” Lil’ Purple said from the sword box.

“It doesn’t need to last for that long. I won’t have that many concerns after reaching the Quasi-Saint Realm. By the way, do you know the power sealed within her body?” Lin Yun asked.

“I don’t know, but she’s not simple,” Lil’ Purple said. The reason why Lin Yun didn’t kill Wang Muyan was because of her. Lil’ Purple told Lin Yun that if Wang Muyan really disregarded her safety, he might have to pay a huge price or even die here. But Wang Muyan seemed to be hesitating over whether she should bring out that power.

This was why Lin Yun let go of Wang Muyan after his consideration.

Whooshing could be heard as Xin Yan descended from the sky. She asked, “Wang Muyan has left?”

“Yeah,” Lin Yun nodded.

“I was worried that you might have killed her, so I followed you here. Now isn’t the opportunity to kill her,” Xin Yan said, heaving a sigh in relief.

Lin Yun instantly understood what Xin Yan meant. Wang Muyan was the princess of the Wang Clan and the Divine Maiden of the Blood Moon Sect. So it would be troublesome if Lin Yun killed Wang Muyan.

“There are already people suspicious of her identity, but there isn’t any evidence, not to mention the Wang Clan has been protecting her,” Xin Yan said. “If she’s the Blood Moon Sect’s Divine Maiden, the Wang Clan must also be involved. You get what I mean, right?”

“I do.” This was the reason why Lin Yun let Wang Muyan go. The Heavenly Dao Sect might plunge into chaos if he alarmed his enemies.

The next day, the Heavenly Dao Sect’s party safely returned to the sect. Ye Qingtian had now become an influential figure within Eastern Desolation, and no one dared to speak badly of him within the sect. Furthermore, his results on the Celestial Purging Mountain were revealed not long after Ye Qingtian left, which caused a huge uproar within the sect. But before everyone could digest that information, they heard that Ye Qingtian killed Jin Xuanyi and a Quasi-Saint, and seized the Divine Blood Flower.

The information this time shook the entire sect, and Ye Qingtian’s reputation was just below that of the Dao Yang Holy Son now. But Lin Yun didn’t care about that and went to see the Serene Dust Great Saint when he returned. He told the Serene Dust Great Saint everything about what happened within the Myriad Graves Valley with his focus being on Wang Muyan.

“You did the right thing by not killing her. Otherwise, it will become troublesome,” the Serene Dust Great Saint said with a grave expression.

Lin Yun was briefly stunned upon seeing this and asked, “Even you have your concerns about this?”

The Serene Dust Great Saint heaved a sigh of relief. She then said, “The current Heavenly Dao Sect might seem to be the strongest holy land within Eastern Desolation with the Divine Phoenix Mountain comparable to us, but there’s an undercurrent within the Heavenly Dao Sect since long ago. The Wang Clan has an unclear relationship with the Blood Moon Sect, the Ye Clan has a connection with the Divine Dragon Empire, and the Zhang Clan has connections with the Demon Gate. Only the Bai Clan is relatively clean in comparison to the other three clans, but that’s only ‘relatively’.”

Lin Yun widened his mouth when he heard that from the Serene Dust Great Saint.

“The Dao Sword and Heavenly Sword’s lineage aren’t going to interfere in this matter?” Lin Yun frowned.

The Serene Dust Great Saint said, “They won’t interfere. After all, the Heavenly Dao Sect was in an even more complicated situation throughout its history, and there are even cases of the sect being laid to ruins. But the sect would rise again when the sect master appears.”

Lin Yun didn’t say anything because he didn’t know what to say. There must be a reason why the Heavenly Dao Sect could exist for so long, and he couldn’t poke his nose into this matter with his current cultivation.

“But you don’t have to worry because the Wang Clan can’t do anything with those two lineages around,” the Serene Dust Great Saint comforted.

“Can’t they get rid of the threat beforehand?” Lin Yun asked.

“You foolish brat. Are you saying that you’re the only one who has noticed a problem with the Wang Clan? Many people have long noticed it, but this problem has been within the Heavenly Dao Sect for a long time. All the schemes will be resolved when a new sect master is born,” the Serene Dust Great Saint smiled.

“Who can become the sect master, then?” Lin Yun asked.

“Anyone as long as they’re not afraid of death and are capable of bearing ‘heavenly dao’ on their shoulders,” the Serene Dust Great Saint smiled. “You can try it after reaching the Saint Realm, if you want.”

But Lin Yun shook his head when he heard that; he still didn’t want to die. Heavenly dao wasn’t something that just anyone could bear or the sect master would’ve appeared long ago.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“I’ll talk to the Dragon Origin Great Saint about it when he returns, so you don’t have to get involved in it,” the Serene Dust Great Saint said.

Lin Yun nodded his head before asking, “Do you know where my master went?”

“He didn’t tell you about it?” The Serene Dust Great Saint asked in a surprised tone.

“No.” Lin Yun shook his head.

The Serene Dust Great Saint instantly became speechless, before she said, “He’s really reckless. He went to the Divine Dragon Void Sea to search for a Divine Blood Fruit in order to help you achieve the Azure Dragon Divine Physique.”

Lin Yun widened his mouth in shock when he heard that. The Divine Blood Fruit was rare, and it was grown in places that were dangerous even to Saint Realm experts. He could tell how terrifying the Divine Dragon Void Sea was just by hearing the name. Most importantly, he already had a Divine Blood Fruit with him!
