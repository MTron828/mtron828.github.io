Chapter 1775 – Lin Yun Making A Move!

“It’s him?!” When Lin Yun removed the bamboo hat, these two words appeared within everyone’s mind. Even the holy lands’ geniuses and Four Young Masters were surprised to see him.

“A musician dares to go on the stage? Isn’t he afraid of embarrassing himself?” The Wind Edge Lord, who had a grudge against Lin Yun, said coldly.

“Wind Edge Lord, I beg to differ.” Ji Lingfeng of the Divine Phoenix Mountain smiled. Raising the wine cup in his hand, he continued, “He defeated Li Yuxi at the Nirvana Banquet, and I believe the other guy is a disciple of the Ming Cult? Haha!”

Ji Lingfeng must’ve naturally heard about the transaction between Lin Yun and the Ji Clan since he had ‘Ji’ as his surname. It could even be said that he benefited from the Phoenix Heart Song. So he would naturally stand on Lin Yun’s side.

The Ming Cult’s Yu Wenxiu had no change on his face, but indifferently said, “Lu Yuxi is strong, but his main focus is on music dao. He cannot be compared to Sikong Yuan in regards to his strength.”

The Wind Edge Lord wasn’t afraid of Ji Lingfeng, so he coldly said, “If I remember correctly, Lu Yuxi’s only at the seventh-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm while Sikong Yuan is at the ninth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. Each of Sikong Yuan’s dragon pulses are a thousand feet, so how can this brat be compared to him?”

Ji Lingfeng also didn’t have confidence in Lin Yun, but he wasn’t willing to admit defeat. He smiled, “We’ll see, then.”

In the pavilion belonging to the Sword Sect, Ye Ziling was also shocked. She locked her brows together and murmured, “Why is it him?”

“You know him?” Mu Xueqin asked in a surprised tone.

“Senior Sister, that person was with Mei Zihua back then.” Ye Ziling replied.

Mu Xueqin smiled before she contemptuously said, “He probably took a fancy to you, wanting to be a hero who saves a beauty. Everyone was touched to hear that he confirmed his relationship with the Profound Fairy under the Three-Lives Tree and even touched the tree. I didn’t expect him to change his mind so quickly. As expected of men!”

Is that really the case? Ye Ziling still had doubts when she heard that, so her slightly favorable impression of Lin Xiao disappeared.

At the Thunderstorm Battlestage, Sikong Yuan was surprised when he saw Lin Yun’s appearance under the bamboo hat. But he soon smiled, “So it’s the Nirvana Banquet’s champion. You’re really not a nobody.”

“It’s also true that my name isn’t on the Dragon Pulse Ranking.” Lin Yun replied.

“You don’t have to be humble. Since you dared to come on the stage, you naturally have to be prepared to take a beating, so I won’t go easy on you!” Sikong Yuan smiled. When he finished, he began to rotate his spear with nine dragon pulses appearing behind him, and each dragon pulse was a thousand feet long. He had no intention of hiding his strength. The sun and moon behind him began to flicker when he rotated his spear.

This attack was bizarre because it even caused heaven and earth to rumble. As Sikong Yuan’s aura rose, the saint spear in his hand rotated a few thousand times in the blink of an eye.

With a powerful gale, the sky turned dark, and Lin Yun could feel a majestic wave of aura rushing towards him. As his hair fluttered in the wind, he involuntarily squinted his eyes.

“Sun-Moon Nirvana Slash!” Sikong Yuan roared, and he threw his spear forth. A bizarre scene occurred because the spear immediately disappeared when it was released.

This surprised Lin Yun, but he retreated with his arms spread apart before Sikong Yuan moved. The spear reappeared with two saint runes as ripples spread out from the void. One was gold, the other was silver, and the afterimage Lin Yun left behind was pierced in the chest by the spear.

When the spear's tip fell to the ground, the entire tip had pierced it, causing the blazing saint blood to splash from the stage. This made everyone take in a cold breath, and they instantly realized that Sikong Yuan had held back earlier when he had fought Ye Ziling. Only now did he unleash the power of someone in the top hundredth on the Dragon Pulse Ranking.

When the saint blood fell back to the stage, it ignited with flames. A terrifying shockwave also swept out. There was no way Lin Yun could avoid this in mid-air.

Inwardly roaring, Lin Yun pushed his hand forth and executed the profundity of the Azure Dragon, manipulating thunderstorms. The omnipresent wind behind him formed into an ocean before shaping into a rumbling wave.

When the two waves collided, they produced a great explosion, and Lin Yun let out a muffled groan. Just the remnant energy within the shockwave had injured him. But three breaths later, Lin Yun had already completely recovered from his injuries, thanks to the Blue Dragon Saint Physique, when he landed on the ground.

"It doesn't feel good, does it?" Sikong Yuan grinned, unaware that Lin Yun had recovered from his injuries. As he soared to the sky, he spun in mid-air and stepped on the far end of the spear. After the spear bent like a bowstring, he shot forth.

When he shot forth, the remaining power left on the spear empowered him. As the sun and moon behind him flickered, Sikong Yuan used this power to punch Lin Yun, “Divine Radiance Annihilation!”

Facing his attack, Lin Yun flashed three times and unleashed three punches, with a hundred thousand dragon runes poured into his punches and resolved Sikong Yuan’s attack.

“Falling Sun Slash!” Sikong Yuan’s speed didn’t decrease, and he roared when he arrived before Lin Yun. When he landed on the ground, his spear flew into his hands before swinging it down. The sheer force of his strike shattered the air. Even though Lin Yun quickly dodged it, he was still caught by the ripple when the spear landed on the ground.

“Die!” Sikong Yuan’s aura was high as he swept his spear forth.

But Lin Yun tilted to the side, facing his attack, before gently giving a push with his right hand, which was empowered by the ocean of wind. When his palm came in contact with the spear, lightning poured into his hand, and his hand was like a dragon’s claw that pushed the spear back.

As lightning crackled and exploded, Sikong Yuan’s arm became numb, and he almost lost his grip on the spear. His nine dragon pulses became berserk, and Sikong Yuan had to shake the lightning away before grabbing his spear and sweeping it over from another direction.

That attack wasn’t easy for Lin Yun to bear, and he saw the spear sweeping over again. He manipulated his dragon origin by instinct, and could feel a tremendous pressure falling from the sky, as though his tribulation would descend at any time.

As the sky became dark with thunderclouds looming overhead, Lin Yun came to his senses and suppressed his dragon origin to a controllable range. Only then did the pressure from heaven and earth decrease.

During a time of desperation, he withdrew his right hand and pushed his left palm forth, accompanied by a violent gale. The wind could defend, and lightning could attack. So he could deal with Sikong Yuan’s attacks by relying on the Blue Dragon Saint Physique.

But Sikong Yuan’s attacks grew increasingly ferocious, forcing Lin Yun to retreat and he could only suffer a one-sided beating from the former. But gradually, everyone began to realize that something wasn’t right.

Lin Yun might seem to be receiving a one-sided beating and was powerless to retaliate, but he was easily handling Sikong Yuan’s attacks. Whenever he made a move, he would easily resolve Sikong Yuan’s ferocious attacks as if they were flowing clouds.

As his white robe fluttered in the wind, they exchanged a few hundred moves in the blink of an eye. Contrary to everyone’s expectations, Lin Yun was calm and composed. Another strike later, Lin Yun’s gaze became sharp, and he noticed that Sikong Yuan’s hand was trembling while holding onto his spear.

When Lin Yun raised his head, he could see the shock on Sikong Yuan’s face. He reached out and grabbed the spear, wanting to yank it away from him. This caught Sikong Yuan by surprise as lightning exploded, and he lost his grip on the spear.

When he came to his senses and wanted to reach out for his spear, it was already in Lin Yun’s hands. Lin Yun was firmly holding onto the spearhead. This instantly made Sikong Yuan panic. But just when he was about to move, the spear turned around and swept at his lower back.

This strike was fast and ruthless, accompanied with rumbling thunderstorms. As Sikong Yuan let out a painful howl, he was sent flying away. Everything happened too quickly, and no one could react in time because they were dumbfounded.

But what happened next was even faster as Lin Yun flicked his wrist, and the spear pierced Sikong Yuan’s chest. This made Sikong Yuan throw out a mouthful of blood as a hole opened in his chest, and the surroundings fell into a dead silence.

Everything took place in the blink of an eye, and all of his movements were so smooth that everyone who was watching couldn’t even exclaim.

“You’re courting death!” Sikong Yuan lost himself to his anger. Despite knowing that Lin Yun had gone easy on him, he still dashed over towards Lin Yun with unwillingness.

Lin Yun let go of the spear and pushed his palm forth with a hundred thousand dragon runes in his palm. When his palm came in contact with the butt end of the spear, the spear rushed forth like a bolt of lightning, shattering the void in its path.

When Sikong Yuan took two steps out, the spear pierced his chest again and sent him flying. As a violent impact spread, the spear was like an azure dragon that knocked him into the sky.

After he landed on the ground, Sikong Yuan’s hair became disheveled, and his expression was pale. He had no blood on his face and held onto the spear with two hands, slowly pulling it out. There was lightning flickering from the spear that spread along his body. When he pulled the spearhead out, he threw out a mouthful of blood before he fell onto one knee.

“Thanks for letting me win.” Lin Yun cupped his hands together.

Sikong Yuan’s face turned red, and he felt so ashamed that he couldn’t utter anything. He initially didn’t have to suffer this humiliation, but he just had to force Lin Yun to stay. Even after knowing Lin Yun’s identity, he still considered Lin Yun to be a pushover and even asked him to be prepared to receive a beating.

When Sikong Yuan fell to his knees, he felt humiliated and wanted to find a hole to burrow in. The entire Thunderblood Square fell into a dead silence, and it took a long time before exclamations echoed and everyone’s blood boiled.

The Ming Cult’s Yu Wenxiu’s face was dark, and he couldn’t utter a word. The corner of Wind Edge Lord’s lips twitched. He wanted to say something but couldn’t even utter a word.

“Hahaha! That’s great! Who says he’s only a musician? In my opinion, the Ming Cult is too weak!” Ji Lingfeng laughed.

Everyone had witnessed how Lin Yun defeated Sikong Yuan, and finally realized that apart from music dao, Lin Yun’s martial dao couldn’t be underestimated. Most importantly, Lin Yun was low profile, making everyone feel even more terrified because they had no idea about his true strength.
