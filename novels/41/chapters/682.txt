Chapter 683 - Azure Dragon Enneaform, Complete Transformation

Lin Yun barely dodged the tail when it hit the ground. He sighed in relief at this, but he didn’t dare to relax, even after the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture had fallen into deep slumber.

Taking a deep breath, Lin Yun’s gaze fell on the demonic beast’s wounds. The wounds were caused by the immortal sword intent, so they were terrifying. He could even see the demonic beast’s internal organs. Squinting his eyes, Lin Yun stretched his hand out with sword energy gathering on his palm that formed a silver vortex.

Placing his hand down on the wound, the vortex in his hand grew stronger. A suction force exploded and he began extracting the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture’s blood essence.

“One!” Lin Yun retracted his hand and there was a black blood essence in his hand, filled with a violent aura.

Right at this moment, the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture’s tail whipped over once more. But since Lin Yun was experienced, he managed to dodge it easily. The tail swept around the wound several times as if the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture was scratching itself.

Lin Yun wasn’t bothered by this because he knew that this was the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture’s instinctive reaction, just like how a person would scratch themselves when sleeping. When Lin Yun landed back down, he placed the blood essence in the jade bottle before he placed his palm on the wound again.

“Two...three...eight…” Lin Yun was rather bold as he showed no signs of stopping even after extracting eight blood essence from the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture.

“Nine! Done!” Lin Yun was satisfied after retrieving the ninth blood essence. But just when Lin Yun was about to stop, the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture’s tail swept over at a faster speed, sending Lin Yun flying away as he threw out a mouthful of blood. When he landed on the ground, he was a thousand meters away and his internal organs were aching.

“It hurts…” Lin Yun groaned as he locked his brows together. At the same time, the three Meditation Incenses also burned out.

“Time to leave!” Lin Yun turned around and ran without hesitation. He was like a specter in the darkness as he traveled through the forest. When Lin Yun saw Lil’ Red running over, his eyes lit up, “Perfect timing!” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Lin Yun smiled as he mounted Lil’ Red and sped off. Suddenly, Lil’ Red’s back began to squirm before growing a pair of dragon wings and flying away. Lil’ Red flew to the border of the Flamedragon Hill before it descended after finding a remote area.

When Lin Yun landed, a ferocious roar echoed out from Flamedragon Hill that resonated throughout the forest. This time, the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture was even more furious than when it faced the Ironblood Sword Gate. But this time, the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture was clearly much weaker.

After all, the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture was even more injured after having nine of its blood essence extracted by Lin Yun. If the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture could recover from its injuries relying on its powerful physique in a few days, then the act of extracting nine of its blood essence was equivalent to damaging its foundation.

This meant that the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture would need a longer time to recover from its injuries and it would be heavily weakened during this period of time.

The Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture roared furiously to vent its anger, slaughtering every demonic beast it saw. Even from the border of Flamedragon Hill, Lin Yun could see towering trees and mountains falling down.

But the main culprit, Lin Yun, had long left. So no matter how the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture searched, it couldn’t find the culprit. On the contrary, it found four Ironblood Sword Gate’s disciples in the depth of the forest and became their nightmare.

“Is that fellow insane? Isn’t it just nine blood essences?” Lin Yun said. But if the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture heard him, it would definitely die from bursting an artery. After all, it was nine blood essences. An ordinary demonic beast would die with that much blood essence being extracted. As for the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture, it barely endured the side effects as it was an overlord demonic beast.

Even so, its foundation was greatly damaged. This meant that it would be in a weakened state for the next two to three months. It was easy to imagine how the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture felt.

“Let’s treat my injuries first.” Lin Yun’s injuries weren’t light from the last tail whip and he wasn’t in the right state to refine the blood essences.

After one night had passed, the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture finally calmed down. Then again, it didn’t have a choice. With its current state, it would die if it encountered a powerful enemy, even if it was an overlord demonic beast.

The next morning, Lin Yun opened his eyes and took out the jade bottle containing the blood essences.

“Time to refine these.” Lin Yun crushed the jade bottle and the nine blood essences began to wiggle around as if they were alive. This made Lin Yun’s eyes twitch as he became nervous.

The Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture’s blood essence wasn’t as pure as the Azure Dragon, so it was filled with a resentful, violent, and murderous aura. In serious cases, he would be affected by this aura. Otherwise, he would run amok from refining it, especially since Lin Yun was so bold to extract nine blood essences from the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture. If Luo Yu knew about this, his jaw would surely drop.

Sensing the terror of the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture’s blood essence, Lin Yun wore a grave expression as he spread his arms. Simultaneously, his clothes exploded as he controlled the nine blood essences to fuse with the Azure Dragon Mark on his chest.

When the blood essences merged with the Azure Dragon Mark, a violent outburst of negative emotions spread out within Lin Yun’s heart. Lin Yun’s pupils suddenly become bloodshot like the ferocious gazes of a demonic beast in the dark.

“Interesting…” Lin Yun muttered as the negative emotions spread out within his heart.

You want to influence me? Dream on! Lin Yun’s eyes glowed as his sword intent began to course through his body.

Upright, faithful, and fearless. Those words reflected Lin Yun’s heart as a swordsman. Suddenly, his sword intent destroyed all the negative emotions in his heart.

When the negative emotions disappeared, Lin Yun circulated the Azure Dragon Enneaform and the azure dragon energy began coursing throughout his body, merging with the blood essences. The Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture’s blood essences might be terrifying, but it had no choice but to submit to the azure dragon energy.

No longer affected by the negative emotions, the refining process became smooth. As Lin Yun refined the violent energy, it roared mightily within his body. But sinceLin Yun had refined the Azure Dragon’s blood essence in the past, this was nothing to him.

As he continued to refine the azure dragon energy, the lightning runes started to transform on his body. There was a violent energy accumulating in his chest, which seemed like a pool made of lightning. Simultaneously, the Azure Dragon Mark began to squirm as it became denser.

When all nine of the blood essences were fully refined, the accumulated energy suddenly exploded as a dragon roar echoed out from within Lin Yun’s body.

Reaching the fourth stage in the Azure Dragon Enneaform, Lin Yun had undergone a transformation. The Azure Dragon Mark emitted a crimson light and the forty-five lightning runes started squirming.

Each of the lightning runes contained a terrifying power. At this moment, Lin Yun felt that he had the strength to crush everything. The forty-five lightning runes had turned into five ferocious dragon runes that were ferocious and domineering. When Lin Yun clenched his fist, he could sense an explosive power gathering in his fist with lightning flickering on the surface of his fist.

Let’s try the armor. Lin Yun had a thought as the five dragon runes formed a membrane on his body. When the glow disappeared, a realistic looking Azure Dragon Battle Armor appeared on his body with the Azure Dragon Mark covering his chest. Astonishingly, the mark looked like a genuine dragon.

When Lin Yun stood up, purple lightning flickered around his body. Looking from afar, his aura was ominous and terrifying.

“What power!” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with excitement as he sensed the power coursing through his body. But in the blink of an eye, the joy in his eyes became indifferent and his killing aura rose. He had revealed his aura on purpose so that the old fart from the Ironblood Sword Gate could sense it.
