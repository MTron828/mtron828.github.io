Chapter 615 - Not Allowing Me To Leave

As the footsteps approached, the Flower Burial Sword in the sword box buzzed even more ferociously. This was the first time the Flower Burial Sword had reacted in this manner since coming to the Withernorth Sea. It was as if the Flower Burial Sword had been challenged.

Lin Yun was startled as he could sense the Flower Burial Sword was undergoing a transformation, reaching the level of a cosmic artifact at rapid speed. Lin Yun estimated that it would be soon.

He was looking forward to the transformation of the Flower Burial Sword. Despite the joy in his heart, Lin Yun maintained his composure. He hadn’t drawn his sword since entering the Withernorth Sea, so the Flower Burial Sword’s fighting spirits had already reached the pinnacle. Lin Yun felt the same way.

“Interesting...possessing such a terrifying body-refining technique and sword intent even more powerful than Xie Yunqiao. You’re a terrifying person even in the entire Ancient Southern Domain.” Pei Yue appeared through the tunnel carrying an ancient saber on his back. He examined Lin Yun and he asked, “Qin An, you’re still alive, right?”

Lin Yun wasn’t surprised by Pei Yue’s appearance. Pei Yue and Qin An had a close friendship and they always appeared together in the Withernorth Sea. Furthermore, their aloof attitudes left a deep impression on Lin Yun.

It was true that there weren’t many people who could compare to him. If the fact that he killed Leng Haoyu in two against one fight and he received Ji Wuye’s palm wasn’t shocking enough, the fact that he defeated Qin An in a fight was truly shocking. If news of this got out, others wouldn’t believe it.

“I would be dead if you got here any later…” said Qin An in a weakened voice as he glared at Lin Yun with boundless rage and killing aura in his eyes. While he spoke, he popped a pellet into his mouth and healed his injuries at a rapid speed. In the blink of an eye, his face was no longer pale. As someone ranked eighth on the outer ranking, Qin An naturally had his own trump cards.

Lin Yun merely glanced at Qin An before he turned to Pei Yue. More accurately, his gaze was on the ancient saber behind Pei Yue. If he remembered correctly, Mo Ling called it the Nethercloud Saber and gave a high evaluation of it.

But surprisingly, Pei Yue only glanced at Lin Yun before he walked towards Qin An. This action made Lin Yun fall into deep thoughts as he wondered if Pei Yue was going to call a truce. Then again, Lin Yun wasn’t against that idea as he had just gone through a battle. Fighting another formidable opponent wasn’t favorable to him.

He could always resume their fight on the ninth level. Lin Yun pondered things while walking to the stone chamber and taking the Azure Dragon’s blood essence. He put in his interspatial pouch and began to leave. But just as he was leaving, a cold voice suddenly came from behind, “Did I allow you to leave?”

The arrogant words were from Pei Yu. The killing aura in his tone was frightening and he was clearly unhappy with Lin Yun’s departure. As he spoke, he threw out a crimson dagger towards Lin Yun.

Lin Yun, who had his back towards Pei Yue, was briefly stunned before a sneer rose on his lips. He didn’t mind letting them go, but since they didn’t appreciate it, then he couldn’t be blamed for being ruthless. In the next second, a towering sword intent exploded from Lin Yun.

“I won’t leave then!” Lin Yun turned around and threw a punch out. He had pushed his Iris Sword Sutra to the limit and his punch reached the crimson dagger in a split second. Along with a collision, the crimson dagger broke into pieces under his punch.

But that wasn’t the end as the Iris Flower bloomed in his violet palace and his next punch shot out like an arrow. This made Pei Yue’s face change as he took several steps back. He never expected that Lin Yun would still be so powerful even after fighting Qin An.

“Qin An, take the Cloud Trigram Pellet. If you don’t take out all your strength, I might not be able to keep this brat here!” Pei Yue yelled with an indifferent voice as he reached for his saber. When he drew the saber, his origin energy and saber intent merged together.

“I don’t need you to remind me!” Qin An naturally knew how powerful Lin Yun was, so he knew that it was impossible for Pei Yue to make Lin Yun stay. Qin An used his whip to form a sea of flames that poured towards Lin Yun.

After taking the Cloud Trigram Pellet, he had recovered a great deal from his injuries. So this attack was the same as when he was in his peak state. It might even be a little more powerful than before.

When Pei Yue’s aura climbed to the pinnacle, his Nethercloud Saber slashed down at Lin Yun. Pei Yue and Qin An launched their strongest attacks at Lin Yun.

The fight suddenly became perilous with two elites from the top ten on the outer ranking joining hands. If Ji Wuye was here, he would probably be fearful of their joint attack.

But Lin Yun allowed them to launch their attacks as his eyes blazed with flames. His xiantian sword intent at greater mastery was pushed to the limit. A silver sword ray enveloped him and he began to throw out a barrage of punches like swords.

The collision created a huge explosion in the hall, like two massive waves slamming against each other. The intensity of the battle had drawn out fury from both sides as they exchanged more than ten moves in the blink of an eye.

With a huge explosion, the three figures retreated. When Lin Yun landed on the ground, he looked at Pei Yue and Qin An, “Let’s end this now…”

“Interesting. I wonder where your confidence came from!” Qin An looked at Lin Yun coldly. Lin Yun’s clothes were stained in blood. Although Lin Yun’s injuries weren’t serious, it was a fact that he wasn’t in a favorable situation.

“Indeed, it’s time for this game to end. But you’re the one dying here!” Pei Yue soared into the sky. He didn’t give Lin Yun an opportunity as his saber turned into a boundless crimson beam that hacked down to split Lin Yun’s sword aura.

So what if Lin Yun’s xiantian sword intent is in greater mastery? I can slash it apart with my saber, just like how I defeated Xie Yunqiao.

“Sword!” But just when his saber was about to reach Lin Yun, Lin Yun roared with his eyes glowing brightly as the Flower Burial Sword shot out from the sword box. Along with a connection he felt with the Flower Burial Sword, a terrifying surge of energy poured into his body from the sword. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

As Lin Yun’s heart thumped violently, he unsheathed the sword and a bright moon illuminated the sky. The moment the moon appeared, Lin Yun’s sword aura that was on the verge of collapse suddenly gathered together and sent Pei Yue flying out.

Luminous Moon!

Before Lin Yun even drew the sword out entirely, two bright lights interlocked and shot towards Qin An at the flick of Lin Yun’s wrist.

“Damn it!” Qin An’s face changed drastically as he was totally caught by surprise. He didn’t hesitate to retreat as he lashed his whip in retaliation.

But how could he possibly withstand Lin Yun’s attack? The moment his whip came in contact with Lin Yun’s attack, Qin An’s aura began to crumble swiftly.

On the other hand, Pei Yue sucked in a cold breath when he saw this scene because Lin Yun’s attack was too terrifying. There was no way he could contest it with the Nethercloud Saber in his hand.

Qin An was sent flying by Lin Yun’s attack and was covered with even more wounds. When he landed on the ground, he looked at Lin Yun together with Pei Yue as fear radiated in their pupils. They never expected that they would lose despite working together.

“Heavenly Cloud Shatter!” Lin Yun unleashed another attack before the two of them could catch their breath. He unleashed the ultimate move of the Aquaselenic Sword with great proficiency.

A crimson sword ray shot out from the Flower Burial Sword and formed a violet gale that swept through the hall. Facing Lin Yun’s attack, Qin An and Pei Yue had to resist with all their might. However, injuries continued to appear on their bodies before they could no longer resist and were sent flying.

As Lin Yun’s aura surged, killing aura radiated in his pupils as he pounced forward, unleashing his sword intent like a tidal wave.

Once again, Pei Yue and Qin An, who had just landed on the ground, were blown away. Pain was written on their faces as they gnashed their teeth while trying to resist the attack.

However, Lin Yun didn’t give them a chance to catch their breath as he exuded a domineering aura and unleashed the Thunderbolt Slasher. When his attack flew out, the origin energy that Pei Yue and Qin An had covered their bodies in was shattered instantly and they slammed against the wall like sandbags.

The wall cracked from the impact before they collapsed on the ground. The entire hall was permeated with Lin Yun’s sword aura. But when Lin Yun sheathed his sword, the sword aura instantly disappeared. Then, Lin Yun looked at Pei Yue and Qin An who were trembling in fear.
