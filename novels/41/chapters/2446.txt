Chapter 2447 - The End of Tian Xuanzi (1)

“Tian Xuanzi’s heaven?” Tian Xuanzi smiled. He continued, “If that’s the case, I’m honored that I can have a Sovereign Constellation named after me. Lin Yun, I have to thank you for that.”

“That’s only a joke, don’t plaster gold onto your face. This Sovereign Constellation has nothing to do with you,” Lin Yun said.

“What a pity. Let me experience it, then.” Tian Xuanzi hovered in the air and landed before Lin Yun.

Lin Yun created countless afterimages and surrounded Tian Xuanzi, performing numerous sword techniques. Each afterimage represented a different sword technique, but they were fatal. After bringing out his constellation, the power of the Flower Burial Sword was pushed to the limit.

Tian Xuanzi calmly faced Lin Yun’s attacks with one hand behind him, and he casually patted out with his right hand. Every time Tian Xuanzi patted out, he would resolve a sword ray.

Lin Yun’s sword was swift, dazzling many people's eyes. But when Tian Xuanzi made his move, those sword techniques became slow enough for everyone to see clearly, alternating between fast and slow, which was weird.

Ten-odd moves later, Tian Xuanyi spun and created countless afterimages, attacking Lin Yun with various palm techniques.

Lin Yun took a deep breath, and his sword slowed down. Facing the barrage of palms, everyone saw the scenes. This changed all the faces of the Great Saints on the stage. Regardless of Lin Yun or Tian Xuanzi, the profundity in their martial techniques had surpassed the gauge of grades, coming in contact with time and space.

They weren’t surprised that Tian Xuanzi could achieve it, but they didn’t expect Lin Yun to achieve it as well. Lin Yun and Tian Xuanzi’s figures quickly blurred with the surrounding space distorting. One was using Space Dao, while the other used Yin-Yang Dao.

Empowered by two Sovereign Constellations, the protection of the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella and the Nichang Dress Song, Lin Yun managed to withstand Tian Xuanzi’s attacks. Just when everyone was sunk into their fight, Tian Xuanzi suddenly used his left hand, sending the Flower Burial Sword flying away, and this scene shocked everyone.

“Hmph.” Tian Xuanzi sneered and pressed forward, wanting to grab onto Lin Yun. But when he reached out, he immediately sensed something wasn’t right because Lin Yun was too calm.

Lin Yun was like a pouncing tiger as he spread his arms apart. The eight ominous beasts in his Sovereign Constellation scattered about. As heaven and earth grew, Qiongqi entered Lin Yun’s body.

Qiongqi’s might sets the world, annihilating everything along with Yin and Yang!

When Lin Yun threw a punch and came in contact with Tian Xuanzi’s palm, Qiongqi’s power poured through his punch, sending Tian Xuanzi flying away. But that wasn’t all, Lin Yun then soared to the sky with a boundless chill sweeping out of him when he glared, freezing even time and space.

With a pair of eyes like the sun and moon, freezing all of eternity with one thought!

Tian Xuanzi suddenly discovered he couldn’t move after being sent flying away, while Lin Yun’s palm landed on his chest.

This made blood drip down Tian Xuanzi’s lips as he was sent flying once more, revealing shock in his eyes.

That was the main body? Lin Yun was baffled. Could it be that Tian Xuanzi couldn’t be bothered to use reality and imaginary moves against him? But Lin Yun didn’t slow down in his attacks.

Kunpeng rises with the wind like the sun, soaring straight to the nine heavens!

As Kunpeng roared, it soared to the sky, shattering the nine layers of heaven and allowing starlight to shine on the Sword Sect. When Lin Yun threw another palm forth, Tian Xuanzi avoided his attack, but the sheer force of his palm made Tian Xuanzi’s hair flutter violently in the wind, and his body looked as though it was about to be torn apart. Just from that alone, anyone could tell how powerful the wind was.

Tian Xuanzi’s face finally changed as he spread his arms apart, shattering the might of Kunpeng before turning around, wanting to return to the Golden-Purple Dragon Throne.

The Winged Dragon slices through the primeval chaos on the summit of Kunlun, unleashing great prowess as the sun rises!

Lin Yun spread his arms apart as the Wing Dragon flew out, inverting the sun and moon. This made Tian Xuanzi land on the stage, and he was shocked to discover that he landed where Lin Yun previously stood while Lin Yun landed on the Golden-Purple Dragon Throne.

“The Heaven Burial Constellation!” Tian Xuanzi frowned and finally figured out what was going on. Others grasped their Sovereign Constellation through comprehension, which meant they couldn’t bring out the full power. However, Lin Yun could bring out the full power since he created it. He could use his various abilities as long as Lin Yun’s cultivation was strong enough.

The phantom of the Flying Serpent bewitches all, disrupting both the circulation of stars and directions!

Lin Yun soared from the Golden-Purple Dragon Throne. Sticking his fingers together, a Flying Serpent flew out, its mouth aiming for Tian Xuanzi’s head. But the attack missed. It was only Tian Xuanzi’s afterimage, and he had long retreated.

When the Flying Serpent was about to charge at him again, Tian Xuanzi snorted and nine swords appeared behind him. That was the Great Profound Sword Canon at complete mastery. He didn’t grasp the Profound Firmament and Grand Firmament Sword Sutras but complemented the sword canon through other means. When the nine swords appeared, he pushed his hand forth and the swords tore the Flying Serpent into pieces.

With the appearance of the Nether Spirit, one of the four seasons would disappear before it! UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

One of the four seasons disappeared as Lin Yun flicked his finger. This touched the profundity of time, and if one were struck by it, the injuries they suffered in the past three months would explode at once. Even if Tian Xuanzi had a higher cultivation than Lin Yun, he would still be heavily injured, and his saint origin might suffer damage.

But Tian Xuanzi was like a reflection from a pond. With a gentle ripple, the fatal attack missed him.

Lin Yun clearly expected this and keenly sensed the altering between reality and imaginary at that moment.

The Ghost Null was born before the primeval chaos was formed, and annihilating divine dragons with a single breath!

This was the last secret technique of the eight ominous beasts. When it was executed, the Ghost Null that ate dragons appeared.

Tian Xuanzi was calm while facing this scene, pushing Space Dao to the limit, before suddenly appearing on the Golden-Purple Dragon Throne, leaning on it. He rubbed his hands together and reached out at the incoming Ghost Null.

Countless dragons flew out from the Golden-Purple Dragon Throne as Tian Xuanzi grabbed onto the Ghost Null’s neck.

“The eight ominous beasts have been vanquished. Lin Yun, what else do you...” Tian Xuanzi raised his head. But before he could finish, a sword ray flew over, piercing his chest and pinning him on the Golden-Purple Dragon Throne.

Lin Yun clasped his hands together with beads of sweat dripping down his forehead. He coldly said, “The eight ominous beasts might have been vanquished, but don’t forget the sword that hovers above them! Don’t forget the sword that suppresses the eight ominous beasts! This is the real trump card of this constellation, and you fell for it!”

But that wasn’t all, Lin Yun pushed his right hand forth. The Black Tortoise Chains turned into nine flying lightning serpents, coiling around Tian Xuanzi on the Golden-Purple Dragon Throne, and bit into him. He controlled the Heaven Burial Sword and the Black Tortoise Chains with one hand.

Seeing this, the Heavenly Sever and Light Subduing Great Saints were terrified and dumbfounded because Tian Xuanzi was restrained. After reaching Tian Xuanzi’s cultivation, this sword definitely couldn’t take his life, but they were still shocked by this scene.

After all, Tian Xuanzi was invincible beneath the Emperor Realm in their eyes, so they never expected him to fall into a disadvantageous position, looking as though he was restrained. Lin Yun’s forehead was covered with sweat, and they seemed to have fallen into a stalemate.

Tian Xuanzi wanted to break free, but Lin Yun forcibly held him down, forcing him to stay on the Golden-Purple Dragon Throne. Even though he made several attempts, lightning flashed on the Black Tortoise Chains and couldn’t break free.

This scene left the Great Saints from the Sword Sect’s faction excited, wanting to take this opportunity to end Tian Xuanzi’s life.

“Don’t make a move,” the Divine Phoenix Holy Master said. He knew better than anyone else how dangerous Tian Xuanzi was. He knew that Tian Xuanzi hadn’t reached a dead-end yet, and they would be in danger instead if they acted recklessly. However, the situation proved that Tian Xuanzi was injured in their fight. He kept trying to return to the Golden-Purple Dragon Throne after facing Lin Yun’s Sovereign Constellation.

Seeing that he couldn’t break free, Tian Xuanzi relaxed and smiled, “Everyone says that I’m the five-hundred-year-old you, but it looks like everyone overestimated me because I wasn’t as strong as you back then.”

Lin Yun didn’t speak because it wasn’t easy for him, and he was struggling to maintain the current situation.

“Flower Burial, you won’t be able to kill me if this is all you got.” Tian Xuanzi raised his brow as the seven swords returned to the throne. When the swords returned, the Golden-Purple Divine Dragon Throne unleashed a powerful aura that snapped the Black Tortoise Chains.

Lin Yun took three steps back before stabilizing himself, and his face was pale.

Patting on the throne's armrest, the Heaven Burial Sword was repelled from his body. With a flick of his finger, the seven swords flew towards Mu Xueling instead of Lin Yun. This interrupted Mu Xueling from playing the music, since she had to focus on the seven swords.

But that wasn’t the end. Tian Xuanzi pushed two palms forward, shattering the Azure Dragon and Heaven Burial Constellation. With that, Tian Xuanzi had crippled half of Lin Yun’s strength.

Tian Xuanzi wouldn’t have taken it seriously previously, but he had to be serious now after suffering a significant loss. Then again, it wouldn’t have been easy for him to shatter the Heaven Burial Constellation if the eight ominous beasts were still around.

When he gently hovered and appeared before Lin Yun, his attacks forced Lin Yun to retreat. Lin Yun already showed signs of losing the fight in just ten moves.

“It has come to an end now!” Tian Xuanzi brought out the Profound Sky Universe that inflicted heavy injuries on the seven Great Saints earlier. When his palm shone brightly, it looked as though a new universe was created in his palm. The power of this palm made everyone feel despair, as though it could destroy everything in its path.

This changed the faces of Ye Guhan and the others. They charged forward with all their might, even if they knew it was too late.
