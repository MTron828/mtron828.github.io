Chapter 1840 - A Drop of Heart's Blood

Yu Wenxiu was still confident just a moment ago, but the situation had turned around in the blink of an eye. The white-clothed man and woman immediately appeared when they were planning to go after the Black Thunder Saint Canon. The moment they appeared, everyone was shocked and thoroughly intimidated.

They were only at the pinnacle of the Profound Life Stage, but the strength they displayed left everyone dumbfounded. It was true that the white-clothed man and woman were only at the pinnacle of the Profound Life Stage, but the strength they could use far surpassed that.

Yu Wenxiu knew that these two were seniors, and they might even be saints. But his confidence came from the Black Tortoise Void Sea, so he didn’t place them in his eyes. As a result, he took a resounding slap to his face.

“Who the hell are you? Don’t you know we’re disciples of the holy lands?!” Yu Wenxiu struggled back to his feet and coldly looked at the woman.

But the woman wore a playful gaze, and smiled, “Even saint disciples didn’t dare to let out a fart in front of me when I was younger. Even their holy sons and maidens were nothing in my eyes. With your strength and talent, I’m afraid that you can’t even enter the inner sect of the Ming Cult, not to mention a direct disciple of a saint. Do you think you’re qualified to represent the holy land? How outrageous!”

The woman waved her hand, and boundless dragon origin gushed out, which instantly sent Yu Wenxiu flying away.

As the Fire God General’s pupils flickered, he laid low and shook his head at the other two God Generals, signaling them not to stand out. The surroundings also fell into a dead silence because the white-clothed man and woman were too terrifying, and they were a lot stronger than Lin Yun with the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown.

Lin Yun was strong with the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown on, but he wasn’t invincible. At the very least, many people felt there was a possibility they could defeat him. Not to mention he didn’t refine the crown, so he couldn’t wear it for long.

“Lin Xiao, I’d like to borrow something from you.” The woman smiled, and her smile was so beautiful that it made many people feel charmed. It was hard for them to imagine someone like her was so domineering a moment ago.

The white-clothed man also directed his gaze over. He didn’t say a word but merely quietly looked at Lin Yun.

“Madam Tian, don’t tell me you want my head?” Lin Yun asked in a half-caution and half-joking tone. He was prepared to take out the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella at any moment and immediately execute it if she dared to cross his bottom line.

“You’re overthinking it.” The woman smiled. “Don’t worry, I have no need for your head or the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown. Take out your Black Thunder Secret Key.”

Lin Yun’s eyes flickered because that could be discussed. He looked at the white-clothed man and the woman. He couldn’t afford to offend either of them, so he asked, “To whom?”

“It doesn’t matter. You can just take it out.” The white-clothed man smiled.

Lin Yun took out the tortoiseshell. But before he could do anything, the tortoiseshell flew between the white-clothed man and the woman. They were both competing amongst themselves, but they ultimately did nothing and allowed the tortoiseshell to hover in the air.

“Remember to return it to me once you guys are done using it.” Lin Yun said.

The woman smiled, then glanced at Gu Jun with a smile, “Old beggar, I need to borrow something from you. A drop of your heart’s blood!”

Lin Yun’s heart sank because the heart's blood was the essence of a person's body. If this person possessed a special bloodline, the heart blood was definitely the purest. So she wanted a drop of the saint blood.

The old beggar’s legs trembled, and he quickly stood behind Lin Yun, “Save me!”

Unless he consumes a powerful saint elixir or something with great nourishment, it would take a long time for him to recover.

Lin Yun squinted his eyes and said, “Madam Tian, aren’t you taking it too far?”

“Get out of the way. I’ll kill him and take it myself.”

“What if I don’t get out of the way?”

“I can only kill you, then!” The woman smiled, causing a great contrast to her appearance.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

This instantly made Mei Zihua and An Liuyan become nervous. Mei Zihua smiled, “Big Sister, you’re joking, right?”

“I’m not joking. Lin Xiao, are you going to get out of the way?” The woman smiled.

“Young friend, get out of the way. A drop of his heart blood won’t take his life.” The white-clothed man was more amicable when he exchanged a gaze with the woman. For some reason, Lin Yun felt that this person’s words could be trusted, so he got out of the way.

“Brat, you sold me out!” Gu Jun cursed. But the moment he said those words, his face became pale with a petal embedded in his heart, and a drop of blood flew out, shrouded with lightning. His breathing instantly became weak, and he nearly fell to the ground. But Lin Yun quickly turned around and supported him before turning to look at Madam Tian. He could sense that this woman was dangerous, and he didn’t even notice how she made the move.

“I knew that I couldn't escape this fate the moment I first saw you!” Gu Jun furiously stared at the woman.

“Haha.” Madam Tian kept the blood and sent the Black Tortoise Secret Key to the starry sky. When the starry sky was embedded into the chest of the Black Tortoise, the entire constellation began to distort and a spatial vortex appeared.

If one carefully looked at it, the vortex was shrouded in lightning, and it gave off an ancient aura. At this instance, everyone could sense a powerful aura coming from it.

“There’s still the Starry Sky Secret Key… the Black Thunder Saint Canon is in there?”

“I’m afraid it’s not that simple. There might be other treasures.”

“Perhaps there might be demonic corpses in there…” Under the surrounding discussions, Lin Yun looked at the vortex because this was his greatest objective for coming here. But it was a pipe dream because he couldn’t afford to offend the white-clothed man or woman.

“Young friend, do you want to come along?” The woman glanced at Lin Yun.

“Don’t agree if you don’t want to die. I know the origin of this tortoiseshell, so I’ll get it back for you.” A voice resounded in his ears just when Lin Yun was hesitating, and he raised his head to look at the white-clothed man. This was because the white-clothed man was warning him.

“My strength is insignificant, so I’ll not join the fun.” Lin Yun rejected it.

“Big Sister, what do you think about bringing me along?” Mei Zihua smiled. He wasn’t too concerned with the Black Thunder Saint Canon, but he was breathtaken by her beauty. Not to mention he was confident in himself, and he was confident that this woman had a good impression of him.

“No can do.” The woman smiled and brutally rejected Mei Zihua.

As two streaks of light soared to the sky, the white-clothed man and woman entered the vortex without any hesitation before the vortex slowly closed.

Mei Zihua was depressed, and sighed, “Who knows when we can meet again after this parting.”

“Ha.” Gu Jun was weak, and he smiled with self-mockery.

Lin Yun had a feeling that Gu Jun naturally discovered something. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be so cautious against the woman. But just when he was going to ask about that, Gu Jun weakly said, “Why are you dawdling? He’s stupid, but are you stupid as well? Quick, go and sweep all the treasures here!”

Hearing that, Lin Yun immediately exchanged a glance with An Liuyan, who immediately understood what he meant. They soared to the sky and headed towards a pillar. The treasure on the pillar was enveloped in lightning, and it wasn’t easy to try and break it apart.

“Holy shit!” Everyone came to their senses and immediately adjusted their breathing before they joined in the competition.

There were a total of thirty-eight stone pillars, and there were only three Glory Saint Artifacts. The others were jade slips, pellets, saint elixirs, cores, or crystal rocks. Even if they weren’t Glory Saint Artifacts, they were still extremely valuable to the outside world.

Lin Yun and An Liuyan rushed towards a Glory Saint Artifact each. As for Mei Zihua, he was slightly slower and it was already too late for him to compete for a Glory Saint Artifact.

As golden light flashed, Lin Yun’s figure was like a sword coming to a stone pillar and seizing a string of Buddhist beads. These secret treasures were precious, but Lin Yun didn’t have much interest in them. Aside from possessing a Buddhist aura, it was also enveloped in lightning that made it seem domineering. This was an excellent treasure in subjugating demons.

When Lin Yun landed on the pillar, lightning began to flicker around him, and he was shrouded in an ancient dragon aura. Many people glanced at him, but they ultimately chose not to clash with him head-on. Thus, no one competed for the Glory Saint Artifact on the pillar he was standing on.

But for the other pillars, there were at least seven to eight people competing for the treasure. Lin Yun didn’t want to waste too much time breaking the restriction and used a brutal method, throwing out a punch at the lightning enveloping the beads.

Accompanied by an explosion, Lin Yun didn’t avoid it and allowed the impact to sweep through him. But the dragon aura enveloping him easily blocked the incoming shockwave. Lin Yun only took three steps back before he regained his foothold.

When the lightning around him dissipated, a string of beads appeared before him. This brought a smile to his face, and he took it without any hesitation. Just like that, he had easily obtained a Glory Saint Artifact.

Then again, the journey over wasn’t smooth, and many people died along the way. Even Lin Yun was in danger several times, but he was ultimately the last one standing.

Lin Yun didn’t waste time examining it and immediately stored it before looking in An Liuyan’s direction. She was ganged up on by several holy land geniuses, trying to stop her from retrieving the Glory Saint Artifact. That was a silver fan with the length of half an arm. It was also engraved with floral runes and had a slender appearance.

Those people ganging up on An Liuyan were familiar faces. They were Yu Wenxiu, Yan Chihuo, Yi Feng, and Lin Qingyang. They were all familiar faces who were in the top ten of the Dragon Pulse Ranking. As for Xiao Yuanqi and Ji Lingfeng, they weren’t around, giving him face.

Just when An Liuyan was struggling to hold on, Lin Yun was enveloped in a golden brilliance as he grabbed onto An Liuyan. He roared, “Back down!”

Yan Chihuo and others were reluctant, but they didn’t even have the courage to face Lin Yun. So they briefly hesitated before cupping their hands and swiftly left for the other pillars.

Not long later, Yu Wenxiu was the only one left, and he coldly looked at Lin Yun, “You think I’m afraid of you?”

But Lin Yun didn’t even bat an eye at Yu Wenxiu and gave him a slap. Yu Wenxiu could never imagine how powerful the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown was. When Lin Yun raised his hand, Yu Wenxiu was horrified to find himself immobilized. When a slap resounded, Yu Wenxiu was immediately sent flying away and smashed into a stone pillar.

Yan Chihuo and the other holy land geniuses weren’t that far away. They felt a breeze blowing past them before they threw out a mouthful of blood and fell to the ground. This instantly made the corner of their lips twitch with lingering fear flickering within the depths of their pupils.
