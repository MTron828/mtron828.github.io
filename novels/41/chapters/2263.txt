Chapter 2264 - Peerless Swordsman

Lin Yun’s arrogance shocked everyone, and had made the Ying River King’s murderous intent become even more terrifying.

Zhao Tianyu’s face changed when he thought about the information he had received. He said, “You’re not required to deal with him. Let me deal with him, instead.”

“Who are you looking down on? Let me do it, instead. Anyhow, someone like him will be a threat if he’s not eradicated,” the Ying River King smiled. He seemed amicable and didn’t look like a Demonspirit but a gentleman; however, his smile gave off a terrifying chill.

Everyone felt that their eyes were dazzled with faint ripples spreading out in the sky as the Ying River King appeared before Lin Yun. With a wave of his hand, a bizarre curved blade appeared in his hand that was imprinted with gorgeous patterns, giving off a demonic radiance.

“This is the Heavenly Moon Blade, a Fourspirit Glory Saint Artifact. It has been a long time since I used it. You’re worthy of being decapitated by it,” the Ying River King said indifferently.

Everyone’s faces changed since they had heard of this blade before. The Heavenly Moon Blade was a Sovereign Saint Artifact of the Demonspirit Clan. It was rumored to contain a demonic moon that formed a world of its own.

This blade might be a replica, but it was still more powerful than ordinary Glory Saint Artifacts. The Heavenly Moon Blade in his hand gave off a terrifying aura as a moon rose into the sky. Under the moonlight, the Heavenly Moon Blade released a dazzling radiance that clad the Ying River King with a faint moonlight.

Everyone was shocked and realized that the Ying River King wasn’t simple. This person wasn’t the Demonspirit they had seen before. He didn’t have any demonic aura and looked like an immortal instead. If it wasn’t for the fact that they knew that this was a Demonspirit, they would have doubted his identity.

“Third Uncle… this person isn’t simple.” Ji Zixi became nervous with her face changing. She was worried for Lin Yun’s safety.

“What a beautiful blade… Can that scumbag block it?” Li Feibai also looked on with concern on her face.

Not too far away, Huang Jingyu and Liu Yunlan exchanged a gaze as they retreated with grave expressions.

“Should we help? That person’s blade intent is above ours…” Liu Yunlan said. No matter what, Lin Yun was a Kunlun Realm cultivator and the genius of the Heavenly Dao Sect in name, not to mention that he was also the Heavenly Dragon Lord.

Regardless if it was for righteousness or their own interests, they should help. They had a holy land behind them with many Saint Elders, and each one possessed a secret treasure. If they made a move, they could pose some intimidation.

“Let’s watch for now.” The Ming Cult’s Huang Jingyu was calm since he wanted to see if the Ying River King could kill Lin Yun.

Liu Yunlan sighed upon hearing that and said nothing else. The three holy lands had allied by placing their stakes on Tian Xuanzi, who promised that the Ming Cult would become the head of the Eastern Desolation.

Lin Yun and the Ying River King were less than a hundred meters away. They didn’t make a move, but their auras had spread to the surroundings, clashing together. It didn’t take long before distortions could be seen in the surrounding space, and even light was being distorted. As a result, the surrounding space looked distorted.

“Your blade intent is interesting,” Lin Yun smiled. He had yet to clash with the Ying River King, and yet he had a rough estimation of the latter’s blade intent, which was at the pinnacle of the Astral Sword Intent. There was also a wisp of possibility that it might be at Quasi-Divine Light Intent. But the Ying River King couldn’t have grasped the complete Divine Light Blade Intent, not to mention the Blade Domain.

Even so, Lin Yun didn’t dare to be careless. He was excited because he could finally feel some pressure. The two opponents from earlier couldn’t even be considered a warm-up for him. As his heart began to beat, he could feel his blood boiling and his fighting spirit was gushing.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“It’s nothing compared to you. But I have no intention of using my blade intent against you,” the Ying River King smiled. He was smiling but inwardly shocked because he could sense a hint of pressure coming from Lin Yun. This piqued his interest because he felt pressure coming from a Quasi-Saint. In his mind, swordsmen shouldn’t exist in this world.

The Flame Dragon Valley began to tremble, with cracks appearing on the ground that were caused by this trembling, including where the restriction was located. Many cultivators who had retreated far away threw out a mouthful of blood after being caught by surprise and their dipper energy becoming completely useless.

Right then, the Ying River King made a move as he empowered the Heavenly Moon Blade with his Blade Dao and swung it, targeting Lin Yun’s neck. He merely swung his blade around with hundreds of crescent moon blade rays flew over towards Lin Yun. The power of this ordinary blade made everyone’s faces change.

“A fourth-stage Saint Lord!” Everyone finally realized that the Ying River King was a fourth-stage Saint Lord. With the addition of the power from the Heavenly Moon Blade, his attack was terrifying.

If they were in Lin Yun’s position, they would only be able to see a terrifying blade that enveloped their entire vision, with blade rays sweeping over from the surrounding area.

Taking a deep breath, Lin Yun remained where he was and swung his sword, targeting the Ying River King’s chest. He was fighting with his life on the line. This was not only a competition to see whose attack was faster, it was also meant to show who was more confident in themselves.

Lin Yun had used this move countless times against his opponents. But it was different this time since the Ying River King looked excited when he saw Lin Yun’s attack. Lin Yun also smiled as they charged at each other, both wearing a smile.

This scene made everyone’s hearts nearly jump out, with their faces becoming pale.

The tip of Lin Yun’s sword pierced into the Ying River King’s chest and couldn’t go any further while the Ying River King’s blade fell onto Lin Yun’s neck, leaving behind a shallow wound.

“Oh my god!”

“Are they insane?” Exclamations resounded from the surrounding area, with many people being stumped.

The Ying River King knocked the sword away with his blade and created many afterimages with his blade surrounding Lin Yun.

Lin Yun wasn’t slow either. He swung the Flower Burial Sword, knocking away the incoming attacks. Their attacks were directed at each other’s vital spots whenever they clashed. They were so fast that they became blurred, and only their attacks could be seen flying around.

They were so fast that ordinary Saints couldn’t keep up with them. Even Gu Xinyu, who was on the Flame Dragon’s skull after being saved by Zhao Tianyu, was dumbfounded.

“H-How is this possible? The Ying River King failed to suppress him?!” Gu Xinyu’s face was terrifyingly pale. He knew better than everyone that the Ying River King should be able to suppress Lin Yun since he was a fourth-stage Saint Lord.

The Ying River King could not injure Lin Yun, and yet he had many sword wounds. Although the wounds weren’t fatal, they looked terrifying, dying the Ying River King red with blood.

“The Divine Firefly Sword…” Zhao Tianyu muttered. “This is the genuine Divine Firefly Sword. So what if you’re a fourth-stage Saint Lord? Even the light of fireflies can compete with the moon.”

Zhao Tianyu couldn’t say anything else because this wasn’t the Divine Firefly Sword that he knew about. He couldn’t keep up with the sword, which appeared to be unfathomable.

The five holy lands and various saint clans were dumbfounded.

“What kind of monster is this…”

“Such a prodigy swordsman shouldn’t exist in this world. This is too outrageous.”

Everyone could feel their scalps go numb while they became unable to comprehend how someone's sword technique could reach such a terrifying height.

“It doesn’t matter because the Ying River King isn’t an ordinary Demonspirit,” Zhao Tianyu said.

Ten moves later, the aura from the Ying River King increased as another dao bloomed. This was another Sovereign Dao, the Great Yin Dao. He had grasped two Sovereign Daos, adding a terrifying chill to his blade.

Facing the incoming attack, Lin Yun raised his sword to his chest but was still sent a few hundred meters away.

“Everything is pale in front of Dao!” Ying River King snorted as chants came from the Heavenly Moon Blade. It felt as though there was a real world inside of it.

This made everyone’s faces change. They became worried for Lin Yun, but Lin Yun was terrifyingly calm with a smile on his face, instead.

Something bizarre occurred next as Lin Yun soared to the sky, splitting himself into two. One was soaring to the sky, while the other charged towards the ground. Before anyone could comprehend what was happening, they felt that heaven and earth had been inverted.

When Lin Yun disappeared, the ground looked like a clear lake with clouds reflected on it. But when they raised their heads, they would realize that the sky looked the same.

The Ying River King couldn’t believe what his eyes were were showing him. It’s as though everything had been distorted around him. Before he could comprehend what was happening, a moon descended from the sky with two Lin Yuns appearing, one executing the Heavenly Dragon Sword Score. While, the other executed the Divine Phoenix Sword Score.

“Heaven Sword Form! Earth Sword Form!” The two Lin Yuns swung their swords with two ancient words. A heavenly screen and gravity overlapped, putting the Ying River King under great pressure, not knowing how to retaliate.

When the two figures overlapped, heaven and earth intertwined as space exploded. This made the Ying River King throw out a mouthful of blood and was sent a thousand meters away, before kneeling on the ground with his face becoming terrifyingly pale.

The Ying River King threw out a few mouthfuls of blood before raising his head to look at Lin Yun, who was hovering in the air, wielding the sword with his clothes fluttering in the wind. He looked like a Sword Immortal, giving off an ethereal temperament.
