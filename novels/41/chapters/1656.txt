Chapter 1657 – Might of the Divine Flames

When the appearance of the owner of that voice was revealed, everyone saw that it was a little girl who looked to be either eight or nine years old. Her long silver hair that was draped down to her knees was like a waterfall while shining with a cold luster. She had flawless features that looked sculpted, with crimson and golden runes on her forehead that added a hint of divinity to her temperament. Aside from that, a black figure was following behind her. It was a mysterious black cat.

“Supreme Heavenly Slaughter Empress?”

“Is there someone by that name in the Ancient Barren Domain?”

“Who’s that little girl?” Everyone was shocked as they looked at the little girl and cat. When they appeared where Lin Yun was in a flash, the little girl waved her hand, and torrential silver light gushed out of her body.

That energy soon turned into a raging snow blizzard, before she pushed her palm forth at the black-robed Saint Lord without hesitation. The two palms collided, producing a huge collision, and the Profound Sky Sect’s Saint Lord was knocked back away.

“Who the hell is that lass?!” The black-robed elder said as he coldly looked at Lil’ Purple.

When everything settled down, a black and a white figure descended beside Lin Yun. Lil’ Purple didn’t bother about the black-robed Saint Lord and turned to look at Lin Yun, “You’re really impressive to force the Profound Sky Sect to flip the table. This mess is a descent scale, even in ancient times.”

She then briefly paused and asked, “You all right?”

“Big Brother, we have a huge harvest this time!” Lil’ Red looked at Lin Yun. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Looking at Lil’ Purple and Lil’ Red, Lin Yun felt warmth in his heart, and he smiled, “I’m fine. But I’m afraid this isn’t as simple as it looks.”

Earlier, when those at the pinnacle of the profound life stage wanted to capture him, Lin Yun didn’t sense that anything was wrong. But when he saw that there were so many Saints here, not to mention that Tian Xuanzi still insisted on taking him away after three Saint Sovereigns arrived, he instantly knew that there was something fishy behind this matter.

Even if his talent was monstrous, he was only at the Dragon Pulse Realm. If Tian Xuanzi had been really determined to take his life, he wouldn’t have spent so much effort and create such a massive scene. It was as if he wanted everyone in the world to know.

Lin Yun instantly had a speculation, and he whispered, “He might be trying to make things difficult for me, but he’s probably doing this to go after my master. But he probably wouldn't hesitate to take my life if he could.”

Tian Xuanzi definitely wasn’t as simple as he looked on the surface. Not only was he absolutely talented, he even had meticulous thoughts. If that was really the case, Lin Yun couldn’t help but worry about his master.

His master’s clones had descended several times, but he practically stayed in the Sword Sect. This was because his master was currently in the critical moment of his tribulation, and it would spell trouble if he left his abode.

But if Tian Xuanzi was really planning to lure his master out of the Sword Sect, today's formation wouldn’t be that simple.

A cold light flashed across Lin Yun’s pupils because he knew that Tian Xuanzi wasn’t easy to deal with. His cultivation was terrifying, and he even had a meticulous heart.

“That sissy does have something to be able to hold the advantage in a fight, even when he’s facing four opponents. I’m afraid that you’re only a chess piece to him. He’s trying to use you to lure the Radiant Sword Saint out of his abode. When the Radiant Sword Saint leaves his abode, all his preparations will go down the drain. Why don’t I take you away right now?” Lil’ Purple asked.

“No, I can’t leave now. If that bastard, Tian Xuanzi, is scheming against my master, I can’t let him off so easily!” Lin Yun said with ferocity flashing across his pupils. He didn’t want to just leave like this.

If Tian Xuanzi was really scheming against his master, he would use the Firmament Saint Cloth to take his life, even if he had to bear countless pursuits for the rest of his life.

While Lin Yun and Lil’ Purple were talking, the black-robed Saint Lord came back with his face completely darkened. The black-robed Saint Lord didn’t dare to carelessly move because he didn’t know about Lil’ Purple’s origin. But his patience was running out. “Who the hell are you?!”

When Lil’ Purple raised her head, her pupils were filled with disdain as she coldly replied, “Since you asked, I’ll be generous to tell you. I’m the Divine Phoenix Clan’s Supreme Heavenly Slaughter Empress of Four Seas, Eight Barrens, 36 Heavens, and 72 Earths!”

After hearing what Lil’ Purple said, the black-robed Saint Lord was briefly stunned and even wondered if Lil’ Purple was messing around with him. Not only he but everyone else who heard her were also stunned.

“Who the hell is this lass?” Chen Yu furrowed her brows.

“She has been following Lin Yun, and I met her several times on the Divine Firmament Peak. I initially thought she was an artifact spirit or some other spirit, but it appears she’s not simple.” Mu Chuan replied after a brief pondering.

“The Supreme Heavenly Slaughter Empress?”

“What a weird name…” Not only those from the Sword Sect, but everyone else was also baffled. Then again, that title sounded formidable for some reason.

The black-robed Saint Lord’s face became black, and he threatened, “I don’t care who you are or where you came from. You better not interfere today, or no one can save you!”

“You’re starting to get on my nerves…” Lil’ Purple raised her head and wore a mocking expression. “This scumbag is only at the Dragon Pulse Realm. Don’t you feel ashamed to make a move against him as a Saint Lord?”

The black-robed Saint Lord’s face sank, and he eerily said, “Just the fact that he slaughtered my Profound Sky Sect’s disciples is enough for him to die. I’m only going to take him back to repent for his sins, and I’m already merciful by not killing him now. You better leave and not get yourself into trouble. No matter who you are, the people he offended aren’t people you can provoke!”

“Ha!” Lil’ Purple wore a brilliant smile, but her smile was filled with ferocity. As her right hand reached forth, indigo flames began to ignite on her palm, and she coldly said, “Not only are you shameless to take advantage of your cultivation to bully him, but you even dare to threaten this empress? You can’t pay the price if anything happens to him, even with the destruction of the entire Profound Sky Sect!”

As she hovered in the sky, the indigo flames in her palm blazed even more brilliantly. Her temperament had also started changing. She was clearly a little girl, but her pupils were filled with the vicissitudes of life, and the ferocity in her pupils could make everyone who saw her feel a chill run down their spines. Most importantly, she didn’t even place the Profound Sky Sect in her eyes, based on her tone.

“You’re courting death!” The black-robed Saint Lord finally lost his patience and coldly said, “Since you’re not going to listen, don’t blame me for being ruthless, then!”

“Are you even capable of doing that?” Lil’ Purple said in a disdainful tone.

This finally made the black-robed Saint Lord lose it as he unleashed his saint dao. The profundity of law was incomprehensible for those beneath the cultivation of Saint Realm, and they would collapse the moment they came in contact with it. But Lil’ Purple wasn’t afraid and clenched her fist after the flames in her palm reached a certain limit.

The flames in her palm distorted the surrounding space, and when they came in contact with the saint dao, the fire swiftly incinerated it to ashes. At the same time, an indifferent voice resounded from Lil’ Purple as she opened her hand again, “Get lost!”

As boundless energy exploded from the indigo flames, the black-robed Saint Lord was pushed back before he could even get close, and this left him shocked as he looked at Lil’ Purple in disbelief.

“What’s going on?” Lin Yun asked in a surprised tone after seeing this scene. After all, Lil’ Purple shouldn’t be this strong, which made him wonder what she had obtained on the Myriad Demon Peak.

“Big Brother, she had her encounter on the Myriad Demon Peak and even recovered some of her memories. You can focus on healing your injuries. I’ll guard you.” Lil’ Red said.

Lin Yun nodded his head upon hearing that. He had exhausted too much of his vitality when he used the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella earlier. Even if he had recovered from most of his physical injuries, he wouldn’t be able to recover to his peak. This also meant that he wouldn’t be able to help Lil’ Purple or anyone with the umbrella anytime soon. So he might as well take this opportunity to recover to his peak.

At that time, he might be able to surprise this Saint Lord by using the third restriction on the umbrella, even if he was only at the Dragon Pulse Realm.

“You dare call yourself a Saint Lord when you’re so weak?” Lil’ Purple said with contempt after striking the black-robed Saint Lord several times. As a smear of killing intent appeared on her face, the indigo flames in her palm were released toward the black-robed Saint Lord.

“Profound Sky Canon—Universal Reversal!” The black-robed Saint Lord quickly formed seals, with his face drastically changing upon sensing a wisp of danger. As the entire heaven and world revolved, a vortex appeared, and he suddenly disappeared.

After he left, the indigo flames ignited the vortex, burning a black hole through the space with ashes flowing out in a liquid form that looked like black blood.

“There’s something fishy about those flames!” The black-robed Saint Lord came to his senses and suddenly discovered that his robe was caught by the flames before he could even think about it. As a terrifying chill swept over from the fire, his sleeves were ignited, and his entire arm was caught in the indigo flames.

This changed the black-robed Saint Lord’s face, and he quickly circulated his saint origin to his arm to resist the bizarre flames. But even so, he only managed to stop the fire from spreading and couldn’t get rid of them. Realizing this fact, horror quickly appeared on his face. He couldn’t believe that this was real. After all, he was a Saint Lord!

“Ha!” Lil’ Purple’s face became cold as she charged over, ultimately gaining the advantage against the black-robed Saint Lord.

Seeing this, Lil’ Red smiled, but its face suddenly changed when it sensed a dangerous aura. When it turned around, it saw a white cat bolting over. The white cat had a pair of ominous crimson eyes, but Lil’ Red didn’t think much about it and wanted to stop the white cat.

When the two cats exchanged paws, a terrifying shockwave swept out along with their collision, and the two auras instantly reached an alarming height.

This instantly shocked everyone. When they directed their gazes over, they saw two cats fighting. But before they could give an exclamation, the two cats grew bigger after the brief fight. The black cat turned into a gigantic dracoape while the white cat turned into a fox with nine tails, and this instantly left everyone dumbfounded as they took in a deep breath. They began to wonder what kind of monsters were around Lin Yun. Everyone was increasingly shocked.
