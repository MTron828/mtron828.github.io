Chapter 1646 - Torrential Killing Intent (2)

Qin Tian executed his bewitching movement technique and leaped down the altar with his hand reaching out at Lin Yun. His dragon origin manifested into a Golden Dragon’s claw that wrapped around Qin Tian’s hand, giving each talon the feeling that they were sharper than a sword.

After refining the Heavenly Origin Pellet, not only did Qin Tian’s cultivation reach the pinnacle of the fifth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, but his martial insight also reached a terrifying height.

“Flicking Divine Finger!” Lin Yun took a step forth and unleashed a sword ray. His movement was smooth, and the sword ray he unleashed shone like a bright star, piercing through the air.

His sword ray radiated with nether energy, and that sword ray instantly eroded a hole in the dragon’s claw. As the hole expanded, Qin Tian’s claw shattered into fragments.

After Lin Yun’s sword ray pierced through the claw, it continued forth, tearing apart the air and heading towards Qin Tian’s face. Looking from afar, it looked like a black meteorite streaking across the horizon.

“Break!” Qin Tian snorted. After he poured all his dragon origin into his fist, he punched the incoming sword ray, shattering it. With his cultivation at the fifth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, a casual strike from him could unleash unimaginable power.

“Sovereign Dragon Seal!” Lin Yun circulated the dragon origin within his violet palace. When the violent energy filled his body, a seven-colored divine light bloomed as he formed seals with his hands.

After the dragon aura he gave off overlapped eighteen-fold, it manifested into an ancient seal that slammed towards Qin Tian.

“Pitiful tricks!” Qin Tian’s body lit up with two radiances, gold and silver, that swiftly formed into armor that covered his body's surface. When Lin Yun’s Sovereign Dragon Seal landed on his armor, it only caused fluctuations on its surface before the ancient seal bounced off.

But even so, Qin Tian still took several steps back. When he lowered his head, he was shocked to discover a fine crack on his armor with blood dripping down.

“Senior Brother!” The faces of the Profound Sky Sect’s disciples changed with disbelief because they couldn’t believe this was real. Lin Yun was able to injure their senior brother? Qin Tian was an invincible existence in the Ancient Barren Battlefield and had suppressed the other powerful sects’ experts alone.

“Pinnacle fourth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm?” Qin Tian’s pupils shone before he wore a sinister smile. “Lin Yun, you still say that you didn’t find the inheritance? Hahaha! It looks like I didn’t waste my time waiting for you! You did not disappoint me. I’ll be taking the Blue Dragon Saint Palace’s inheritance!”

Qin Tian’s eyes radiated with excitement, and he could feel his blood boiling. Just the Blue Dragon’s Divine Blood within Lin Yun’s body alone was enough to excite him. If Lin Yun had obtained other treasures in the inheritance, it was simply unimaginable!

“Find an opportunity to save him.” Lin Yun said softly. His face was calm, and he took a step forth.

“Divine Dragon Sun-Moon Cauldron!” Qin Tian was the first to make a move, and his pupils were filled with insanity. As golden light exploded from him, he clenched his fists together. A divine dragon manifested into a massive cauldron with the Heavenly Sun and Heavenly Moon engraved on it before they flew out along with his punch. Each of his punches was like a divine cauldron that bombarded Lin Yun.

But Lin Yun didn’t panic and used his nether energy to summon the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron from within his body. Then, he clashed with Qin Tian head-on with the Divine Solar Lunar Fist. Along with a ferocious roar, Lin Yun’s dragon origin was like a boiling volcano clashing with Qin Tian head-on.FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Hahaha! Come again!” Qin Tian laughed with his hair fluttering wildly, and a painting flew out from his body. That was his constellation. When his constellation opened up, a figure stepped out from the painting. That saint looked simple and unadorned, but the aura from this person tore apart the demonic clouds within a thousand miles.

“Saint Clone Constellation!”

“Qin Tian’s constellation is actually an Ancient Great Saint? Is this person the chosen one?”

“Lin Yun is finished…” Everyone was dumbfounded as their gazes fell onto the painting that Qin Tian summoned. They began to wonder if that was the constellation Tian Xuanzi prepared for him or if Tian Xuanzi created it.

“Saint Clone Constellation? How did he manage to do that…?” Gu Ruochen widened his mouth. This was his first time seeing Qin Tian’s constellation. He never expected that Qin Tian would have this constellation. He never expected that the clone of a saint would fly out from Qin Tian’s constellation!

With the Saint Clone Constellation, the Divine Dragon Sun-Moon Cauldron, and his Golden Dragon Bone, the aura Qin Tian gave off immediately suppressed Lin Yun’s sword aura.

Qin Tian grinned and roared, “Let me see how you’re going to block this. Sun-Moon Wheel Slash!”

After Qin Tian summoned his constellation, he no longer held back and executed the dragon spirit martial technique he had previously used to force Lin Yun to retreat.

This scene made the faces of Gu Ruochen and others change because they had personally witnessed the power of this attack before. Back then, Lin Yun nearly lost his life because of it. Even if he barely managed to withstand Qin Tian’s attack, he was still heavily injured. They began to worry about whether Lin Yun could withstand this attack from Qin Tian.

“Profound Sky Saint Sovereign, invincible in the Ancient Barren!”

“Profound Sky Saint Sovereign, invincible in the Ancient Barren!” The Profound Sky Sect’s disciples could feel their blood boiling when they saw this scene and were excited. This was because their senior brother was too powerful, with an invincible momentum.

When the Heavenly Sun and Heavenly Moon descended, all of the Sword Sect disciples were sent flying away, aside from Lin Yun. Before it really descended, just the shockwave of the aura alone was enough to injure Gu Ruochen, An Liuyan, and the others.

At this moment, Qin Tian was like a deity with a massive sun and moon revolving like two wheels. The sky would alternate between light and dark as if time had accelerated.

“Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple, how will you fight me?!” Qin Tian hovered in the air with his hair fluttering in the wind while pushing the sun and moon wheels forth. Two Golden Dragons beside the saint’s clone that was behind him also let out a roar and golden light shone from their pupils.

“I have a sword named Flower Burial.” Lin Yun stood where he was, and the Flower Burial Sword flew out from the sword box he was carrying.

When he drew the Flower Burial Sword from it’s sheath, he turned into a streak of light and clashed with the two wheels. Under everyone’s unbelievable gaze, Lin Yun merely used a small sword to block the two wheels.

At the same time, Lin Yun started forming seals, and multiple paintings flew out from his body. If one looked at them carefully, five paintings were hovering above Lin Yun’s head.

“Five Constellations?” Everyone was dumbfounded with disbelief.

“Open!” But before anyone could respond, Lin Yun waved his hand, and the five paintings opened simultaneously. They were the Aurora Dragon, Flying Serpent, Qiongqi, Demonic Phoenix, and Winged Dragon!

Those five ominous beasts were colossal. When they appeared, the demonic clouds enveloped myriad miles of radius. When Lin Yun raised his head, his pupils radiated with powerful killing intent.
