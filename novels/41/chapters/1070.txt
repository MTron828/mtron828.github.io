Chapter 1071 - The Heart Of A Swordsman Will Never Bow

Lin Yun’s actions went beyond everyone’s wildest imagination. He was simply too brutal. Not only did he defeat the Nether Divinity Realm Son within three moves, but he even ripped off an arm. The current situation was way worse than if he had slapped the Nether DIvinity Realm Son’s face. After all, slapping the Nether Divinity Realm Son was just simple humiliation, not a debilitating injury.

It would cost the Nether DIvinity Realm Son a great price to recover. After all, every single part of the human body was precious for cultivation. It was the same reason why demonic beasts would transform into their humanoid form. Of course, this excluded those with heaven-defying bloodlines.

After losing one arm, the Nether Divinity Realm Son didn’t have the means to obtain a high achievement in the competition. He was basically crippled

The brutal scene left the Elysium Trigram and Profound Dragon Realm Sons dumbfounded. They flew towards the Nether Divinity Realm Son instead of charging toward Lin Yun. Even the crowd couldn’t believe that Lin Yun was bold enough to rip one of the Nether Divinity Realm Son’s arms off.

All of the Realm Sons were dumbfounded, including the mysterious Imperial Feather Realm Son.

“What was that earlier? Sword aura comparable to a holy spirit?” asked a Realm Son with a grave expression. It was strange because Lin Yun ripped the Nether Divinity Realm Son’s holy spirit apart without bringing out his holy spirit.

Everyone shook their heads because it didn’t make sense. They suspected that Lin Yun did something else. After all, a sword aura comparable to a holy spirit meant that Lin Yun’s sword intent was unfathomably strong.

The Profound Sky Sect’s Elder Jin Jue looked at the Heavenly Path Mirror with disbelief. When he recovered from shock, rage started to fill his face. The other elders were also shocked because Lin Yun acted before they could respond.

“How are you?” The Elysium Trigram and Profound Dragon Realm Sons helped the Nether Divinity Realm Son up and stopped his bleeding.

“K-kill him no matter what!” The Nether Divinity Realm Son roared with bloodshot eyes.

“Move!” Lin Yun barked at the Elysium Trigram and Profound Dragon Realm Sons. This was just the beginning. Lin Yun planned to humiliate the Nether Divinity Realm Son a thousand times worse than what Luo Chen received.

When Lin Yun unleashed his killing aura, the hearts of the Elysium Trigram and Profound Dragon Realm Sons sank. They knew that Lin Yun had no intention of letting this matter rest. The Elysium Trigram Realm Son roared, “Lin Yun, don’t take it too far! The Heavenly Path is long. Plus, do you really think you can act so arrogantly when you’re in Kunlun Realm?”

The Profound Dragon Realm Son continued, “Don’t be too confident because you’re nothing in Kunlun Realm. There are plenty of people who can deal with you there. You better get lost now or no one will be able to save you!”

Lin Yun ignored their chirping. As he walked forward, his sword aura started to rise. With every step he took, he circulated his sword sutras an entire cycle. After three steps, his sword aura had accumulated to an unprecedented height. Additionally, his killing aura was growing with his sword aura.

“Bastard! Lin Yun, do you really want to force the Nether Divinity Realm Son? It won’t benefit you in any way in the final battle!” The two Realm Sons gnashed their teeth. They could sense the power radiating from Lin Yun and they could tell that benefited greatly in the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm.

Since Lin Yun defeated the Nether Divinity Realm Son in three moves, no one knew how many trump cards he had left.

“I’m not targeting the Nether Divinity Realm Son!” Lin Yun paused and then continued, “I’m coming after you two as well!”

Lin Yun had no intentions of letting any of them off. At this moment, his body was trembling from the amount of sword aura that he accumulated. His body was filled with unrivaled power that his physique couldn’t bear.

“Lin Yun, don’t push it!” The Elysium Trigram and Profound Dragon Realm Sons were enraged by Lin Yun’s attitude. Without any hesitation, they unleashed their holy spirits with nine Demonic Astral Flowers blazing in their aura oceans. After seeing the Nether Divinity Realm Son’s outcome, they didn’t dare to underestimate Lin Yun.

They were also a lot stronger than before. So when they unleashed their holy spirits, they unleashed a pressure greater than the Nether Divinity Realm Son’s holy spirits.

“Since you want to flip the table and let the other Realm Sons benefit, don’t blame us!” The Elysium Trigram Realm Son’s eyes flashed coldly.

“Don’t regret it later,” said the Profound Dragon Realm Son. They both felt that they could at least heavily injure Lin Yun if they put their lives on the line. If that happened, Lin Yun would be powerless before the other Realm Sons.

The other Realm Sons were watching the fight with playful gazes.The more intense the fight was, the more they would benefit.

“How unwise! The other Realm Sons won’t hesitate to move if Lin Yun gets injured.”

“They won’t let him off if they see an opportunity!”

“He’s too rash!” Everyone was surprised that Lin Yun wasn’t backing down.

“Hmph, the Elysium Trigram and Profound Dragon Realm Sons might be insignificant among the Realm Sons, but they’re still Realm Sons,” snorted the Imperial Diagram Realm Son with cold eyes.

“Profound Dragon Devouring Palm!”

“Sky Demonic Elephant Devouring Palm!” The two Realm Sons charged over at Lin Yun. The Profound Dragon Realm Son unleashed a gigantic dragon claw that tore space apart. Thousands of dao runes were gathered on the center of the dragon claw, forming a complicated spiritual array with an ancient aura.

The Elysium Trigram Realm Son also unleashed a demonic elephant to crush Lin Yun. There was no question that their holy spirit martial techniques were terrifying. At the very least, their techniques had improved a lot since Wind Mound City.

Letting out a roar, Lin Yun’s clothes began to flutter violently. He pushed his palm out with all of his accumulated sword aura. He was unleashing the power of his Azure Dragon Sword Aura that refined twenty droplets of dew. So, an azure dragon of thirty feet was now coiling around him.

The powerful azure dragon emitted a violent thunderstorm while its eyes were full of flames. Then, two beams shot out of its eyes that struck the holy spirits. The holy spirits were instantly devoured by the flames.

“This…” The Elysium Trigram and Profound Dragon Realm Sons both had disbelief on their faces. But they had no choice but to believe the reality before them.

Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon Sword Aura had reached its limit after nine steps. He could still feel the immense pressure on his insides as he now had little tears on his organs. He had displayed his strongest attack that wouldn’t have been possible without all the dew that Yue Weiwei gave him.

The pain he currently felt was unimaginable, but it was numbed by his hatred. Shortly after, Lin Yun threw out a palm that crushed the holy spirits and the Realm Sons.

The Elysium Trigram and Profound Dragon Realm Sons unleashed their hidden strength as they clashed with Lin Yun. They exchanged dozens of moves in a split second. But a brief moment later, the Realm Sons were sent flying with huge holes in their chests. Then, they looked at Lin Yun in fear.

“Are these the so-called Realm Sons?” Lin Yun exploded with powerful sword intent as he looked at the trembling Nether Divinity Realm Son. Then, he enveloped the Nether Divinity Realm Son in his sword aura.

“Stop!” But just when Lin Yun was about to claim the Nether Divinity Realm Son’s life, someone yelled. The voice came from the Imperial Diagram Realm Son. However, he wasn’t alone. The other Realm Sons were also looking at Lin Yun with grave expressions.

They finally can’t hold back? Lin Yun wore a mocking smile because he didn’t have a favorable impression of the Realm Sons.. He knew that they were aiming for him secretly when he was heavily injured back in Wind Mound City.

“Let your grudge with those three come to an end here,” said a Realm Son.

“You’ve already taken it too far. No matter what, he’s still a Realm Sons. He’s not on your level!” yelled another Realm Son.

“Lin Yun, don’t force us to become enemies!” The Imperial Diagram Realm Son said.

The Nether Divinity Realm Son smiled at Lin Yun with ridicule. No matter how the Realm Sons fought, they wouldn’t allow one of their own to die at the hands of someone from a lower realm.

Lin Yun’s heart turned cold as he asked, “What if I insist on taking his life?” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“You can try. But the moment he dies, you will too!” A cold voice sounded out. It came from the most mysterious Realm Son, the Imperial Feather Realm Son. His voice made him sound like he was from the underworld as the entire Saint Spiritual Lake started to tremble. His voice was cold, but it was also filled with pride as if he was a god.

The crowd was stirred because they heard rumors that the Imperial Feather Realm Son seized a Divine Blood Fruit. It made sense since his aura overwhelmed the other Realm Sons. At this moment, Lin Yun looked like he was abandoned by the entire world.

Lin Yun didn’t turn around, but he could sense seven pairs of threatening eyes. It felt as though he would lose his life the moment he turned around, which placed him under immense pressure. Anyone else would have already submitted to the pressure. Why do I feel so reluctant?

When Lin Yun saw the disdainful gaze from the Nether Divinity Realm Son, he realized why he didn’t want to yield. Clenching his fist, Lin Yun’s body began to tremble, “Since that’s the case, you can all come at me together.”
