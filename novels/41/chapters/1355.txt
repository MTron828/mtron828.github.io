Chapter 1356 - I Have A Song, Please Enjoy (1)

Lin Yun stood in the sky with dazzling sword rays exploding from his body. With the pair of Golden Crow Wings that reached over twenty meters in length, it made him look like a majestic deity.

When he raised his hand, the powerful aura he unleashed made the entire heaven and earth appear to tremble. This made him look like an immortal, enveloped in an ethereal aura. As the boundless sword intent began to roar, the entire sky was dyed in gold, making it look like a golden ocean. This was an ocean of sword intent that was manifested from Lin Yun’s firmament sword intent.

“Firmament sword intent!”

“H-H-How is this possible? Didn’t people say that not even those in the Dragon Pulse Realm could grasp it?”

“Holy shit, just what the hell is going on? Someone who has just reached the Elysium Core Realm has grasped the firmament sword intent? Or did he already grasp it when he was at the Empyrean Realm?”

“This is a little too exaggerated!” Those who were forced onto their knees under the sword aura were covered in sweat with their faces ugly. Aside from horror, they had no idea what was going on.

As for those who managed to bear the immense pressure of the sword aura, they were all left dumbfounded, and Lin Yun’s firmament sword intent also left those from the various powerful sects dumbfounded.

At this moment, the restriction on the Profound Wither Island was already tattered. Since the storm around the island was already greatly weakened, the people outside could see what was happening on the island with their eyes. If they weren’t afraid of the restriction, they would’ve charged forth and competed for the Great Saint Origin.

As countless gazes fell onto Lin Yun, everyone could feel that anyone who was in the same cultivation as him was nothing to him. At this moment, Lin Yun was the emperor of all swords, and just his gaze alone could injure the souls of others.

“This is a monster! A monster!”

“The strongest champion of the Ninth Heavenly Path… looks like it wasn’t fake.”

“I’m afraid that Lin Yun’s name will spread throughout the Ancient Barren Domain in the future. I wonder how strong he will become in the future…” Outside the Profound Wither Island, countless elders from the powerful sects were thoroughly left dumbfounded.

In the Profound Sky Sect’s camp, the Dragon Pulse Realm elders all wore grave expressions as they looked at Qin Cang with worry in their eyes. But they soon calmed down when the corner of their gazes looked at Zhuge Qingyun, who was covered in a hood. With Zhuge Qingyun around, everything would be under their control.

Even on the Profound Wither Island, the people there were unsure who would win and who would lose. After all, Qin Cang was a junior who received the Profound Sky Saint Sovereign’s importance. It was so much so that Tian Xuanzi had already said that he would take Qin Cang as his disciple when Qin Cang reached the Elysium Core Realm, and that was a huge glory in the eyes of everyone in the Profound Sky Sect.

Without outstanding talent, Tian Xuanzi wouldn’t have placed such importance on Qin Cang. It was so much so that there were rumors that the Golden Dragon Bone was given to Qin Cang by Tian Xuanzi.

As Qin Cang stood in mid-air before the Seven Treasured Glazed Tile Pagoda, he also couldn’t help being surprised when he saw the boundless sword aura around Lin Yun. He initially thought that he would be undefeated as long as he had the Golden Dragon Bone, but he never expected that Lin Yun would still have another trump card.

In just this short period of time, Qin Cang had thought about many things. Just when others were still guessing if Lin Yun had grasped the firmament sword intent while he was at the Elysium Core Realm or the Empyrean Realm, he was sure that Lin Yun had grasped it when he was at the Empyrean Realm.

When he fought Lin Yun earlier, he was curious about where Lin Yun was able to get his confidence to face him when he was still at the Quasi-Elysium Core Realm. Instantly recognizing that Lin Yun was terrifying, Qin Cang’s gaze turned cold because he felt that he was already heaven-defying enough. But he never expected that there would be someone even more heaven-defying than him.

After all, it made no sense for someone to grasp the firmament sword intent at the Quasi-Elysium Core Realm.

“You want to take my life with the firmament sword intent? That’s impossible!” But Qin Cang was fearless and coldly snorted before he circulated the origin saint rune on the Golden Dragon Bone to the limit. In the next moment, golden scales began to appear on the surface of Qin Cang’s body as he pushed the Golden Dragon Skypatching Art to the limit.

At this moment, he had already brought out all of the power of the Golden Dragon Bone. A terrifying golden dragon aura exploded towards Lin Yun.

“Golden Sacred Flame!” Forming seals with both his hands, surges of boundless energy began to ignite on the Golden Dragon Bone. When the energy made a full circulation within his body, it then surged towards his throat.

Opening his mouth, Qin Cang breathed out boundless golden flames that headed toward Lin Yun. In the next second, flames comparable to dragon flames swept out and instantly enveloped the heavens and earth.

As the Golden Crow Wings flickered behind Lin Yun, this made his movements become unfathomable with afterimages and sword rays flying about. But the afterimages began to shatter into pieces under the flames and all of Lin Yun’s afterimages were destroyed in the blink of an eye, leaving his real self behind.

When Lin Yun’s real body was revealed, this instantly made everyone’s attention focus on him. As a sword vibration echoed, countless sword auras began to envelop him. As sword rays flickered on the surface of his body, Lin Yun charged forth under the pressure of the golden dragon aura.

Seeing this scene, Qin Cang’s gaze was indifferent as his Golden Dragon Bone shone brightly, causing the surrounding space to distort. His gaze began to glow golden like dragon pupils as he stared at Lin Yun.

At the same time, Qin Cang raised his hand and the Demonic Lotus Saint Rune bloomed in his palm, instantly allowing him to emit a terrifying aura that was comparable to Heavenly Elysium Core Realm experts. When he pushed his palm forth, the entire world began to spin with a demonic lotus appearing behind him that could tear the golden clouds apart.

Within the demonic lotus, there was a golden dragon that released a ferocious roar. He quickly broke the firmament sword intent’s pressure head-on and even broke through Lin Yun’s sword aura with his palm that was heading towards Lin Yun, causing everything that stood in its path to crumble.

Furthermore, he had already activated the power of the two origin saint runes at the same time, not to mention that he had unleashed the power of the Profound Sky Canon. So the lethality had reached a height that even Heavenly Elysium Core Realm would be fearful of.

But facing Qin Cang’s attack, Lin Yun wasn’t the slightest bit bothered before unleashing a sword ray with his finger that contained a draconic aura, manifested with the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon.

“What power!” Everyone’s lips couldn’t help twitching when they saw Lin Yun’s attack. After all, Qin Cang had even resorted to such a powerful attack, activating two origin saint runes at the same time. But Lin Yun relied on his firmament sword intent to easily resolve this attack.

But Qin Cang was still approaching Lin Yun and they couldn’t imagine what would happen if Lin Yun’s firmament sword intent lands on Qin Cang’s body. They began to wonder if Qin Cang could block this attack by relying on his physique alone.

This made everyone worried if Qin Cang could survive under Lin Yun’s firmament sword intent. But Qin Cang’s heart was calm and his eyes were brimming with confidence. In his eyes, Lin Yun was still far from being invincible, or he would’ve long used his firmament sword intent. When he was about to get close to Lin Yun, Qin Cang smirked and charged forth.

Spreading his palm wide open, the Demonic Lotus Saint Rune in his palm bloomed and rumbled as a demonic light began to spread out from his palm. In the blink of an eye, the demonic light had covered the golden clouds, making it appear as though all of heaven and earth were within his grasp.
