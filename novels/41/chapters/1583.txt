Chapter 1584 - No Matter Who Comes!

The Cold Pond was deep in the Annihilation Mountain Range, a dangerous ground of the Withered Mountain Range. It would take them some effort to go there. Not only was the journey far, but there were many powerful demonic beasts along the way, and they would be in trouble if they weren’t careful. It was practically impossible to quietly reach the Cold Pond, and they would be dead if they weren’t lucky and ran into Samsara Edict Realm demonic beasts.

Several figures flew across the dark woods. They were all in the Dragon Pulse Realm, especially the leader of the group. His aura felt like a ferocious dragon, a sign he had reached the pinnacle of the third-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm.

“This is the second batch, right!” Lin Yun said as he walked out of the hiding spot with his brows furrowed. This was the third person in the third-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm he ran into along the way, and they were all at the pinnacle.

The increase in strength at each pulse was obvious, especially the third-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, because it transformed the vitality and strengthened the physique. Back in the Heavenly Pool Gathering, he barely managed to defeat Luo Yuan, who had just reached the third-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm.

It was fine if he faced a pinnacle third-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm because he was confident of fleeing even if he couldn’t defeat them.

“Are there other usages to the Black Tortoise’s Saint Blood?” Lin Yun asked. He had a feeling that these people were heading to the Cold Pond.

“If I remember correctly, the Black Tortoise’s Saint Blood can aid them during their tribulation. After all, failing the tribulation means death, especially when the tribulations in the third, sixth, and ninth-pulses are more dangerous!” Lil’ Purple said, emphasizing ‘death.’

“That works? Why didn’t Senior Sister Mu tell me about it?” Lin Yun asked. He knew there was a threshold every three pulses, but he didn’t realize that Black Tortoise’s Saint Blood could help in the tribulation.

“You didn’t ask, right?”

“Uh…”

“You also didn’t tell her that you needed it to cultivate the Divine Tortoise Transformation, right?”

“I didn’t.”

Rolling her eyes, Lil’ Purple replied, “And you still have the cheek to blame Mu Xueqin? She probably thought that you needed it for your tribulation.”

Her words made Lin Yun smile awkwardly, but his eyes soon lit up, and he asked, “That’s possible?”

“Of course. Speaking of which, you really need it. Your foundation is too terrifying by converting all your astral energy into dragon origin. I speculate that your tribulation might be more terrifying than others at the third pulse.” Lil’ Purple said after a brief pondering.

Lil’ Purple’s words made Lin Yun’s face sink because he really didn’t think about that, and Lil’ Purple had really reminded him. He was initially planning to find an opportunity to make a breakthrough, but it looks like he had to plan it now.

“Is it possible that the Black Tortoise’s Saint Blood can help me through the tribulation and cultivate the Divine Tortoise Transformation?” Lin Yun asked with flames blazing in his eyes. Only a child would pick one between the two, and he wanted both!

“Ha.” Lil’ Purple sneered. “You wish.”

Lin Yun smiled bitterly upon hearing that, and he asked, “Is it really impossible?”

“Well, it’s not exactly impossible.”

“Speak!” Lin Yun’s eyes shone brightly.

“If you’re its father.” Lil’ Purple wore a mocking smile.

Lin Yun’s face sank when he heard that because Lil’ Purple was routing to scold him. If he was the father of the Heavenly Profound Tortoise, wouldn’t that make him an old tortoise?

Seeing Lin Yun’s expression, Lil’ Purple laughed, “Don’t bother thinking about it. Don’t really treat it as a tortoise because it’s a Heavenly Profound Tortoise! As a descendant who inherited a divine beast’s bloodline, it won’t be easy to deal with, even if it's in the Dragon Pulse Realm. I’m a divine beast and know it better than you.”

Lin Yun nodded because Lil’ Purple was no longer confident when they spoke of the Heavenly Profound Tortoise. One must know that even those at the Samsara Edict Realm would have difficulty dealing with ominous auras close to ten thousand years old.

“Let’s go.” Lin Yun hopped down the tree and sat on the Demonic Rune Tiger, “Lead the way.”

The journey to the Cold Pond was far. There were many demonic beasts along the way, and they would be hindered if they weren’t careful. But with the Demonic Rune Tiger leading the way, it could save them time.

Suddenly, a firework lit up in the dark sky, and the fire formed the Sword Sect’s symbol. This made Lin Yun’s face change when he saw this scene because this was a sign that a Sword Sect’s disciple was in danger. He dashed into the sky from the Demonic Rune Tiger’s back, executing his movement technique, and bolted over.

“Why does Lord Lin need to ride me when he’s so fast?” The Demonic Rune Tiger was dumbfounded.

Lin Yun didn’t take long to arrive where the firework lit up. When he landed on a tree and looked ahead, there was a Sword Sect’s disciple facing a bladesman, and another person was watching from the side. More accurately speaking, this person wasn’t just watching from the side.

This saint spiritualist created layers of arrays to suppress that disciple from the Sword Sect. That Sword Sect’s disciple was in the first-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, and his opponent was in the third-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. It was clear that they were toying with him, and they probably released that signal wanting to attract more of Sword Sect’s disciples.

“These two again!” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly because these two were the demonic cultivators he had previously ran into, Dong An and Mo Yun. As for that Sword Sect’s disciple, it was Chen Ling of the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra, the person he fought with when he had just joined the Divine Firmament Peak.

“Looks like there won’t be any more disciples. It’s meaningless to kill him.” Mo Yun smiled from the side.

“It doesn’t matter. I’ll play for a little longer. Big Brother said there’s no need to let them have an easy death if we run into the Sword Sect’s disciples.” Dong An wore a sinister smile as he unleashed a blade ray and sent Chen Ling flying away.

“How weak!” Dong An looked at Chen Ling with a smile. Three dragons then faintly appeared behind him.

This brought despair to Chen Ling’s face because he knew he would be killed today. But fortunately, no Sword Sect’s disciples were attracted to this location because of him, or he would feel guilty even in his death.

“Haha. Brat, let’s play a game. I’ll stand here. If you can make me budge with a punch, I’ll give you an easy death!” Dong An smiled sinisterly.

“Kill me if you want and cut the crap. The Sword Sect will take vengeance for me!” Chen Ling gritted his teeth.

“You’re pretty stubborn. They all say that Sword Sect’s disciples are stubborn, so let me see how stubborn you are!” Dong An sneered as his third-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm aura pressed down, crushing on Chen Ling’s sword aura.

“Kneel!” Dong An laughed.

As Chen Ling threw out a mouthful of blood, his face distorted, and he roared, “Sword Sect’s disciple cannot be humiliated!”

This made Dong An’s face change, and he couldn’t help being moved by Chen Ling’s gaze. But a brief moment later, that soon became rage blazing in his pupils.

“Well said!” A voice echoed as Lin Yun descended beside Chen Ling. As Lin Yun unleashed his sword aura, the pressure Chen Ling felt was instantly lifted.

When Chen Ling raised his head, he was shocked to see Lin Yun and yelled, “Senior Brother Lin, why are you here? Leave quickly! They’re both demonic cultivators on the Demonic Ranking. Return to the sect and inform the deacons to capture them!”

“Haha! We meet again, brat!” Dong An was briefly stunned upon seeing Lin Yun before he laughed, “Where’s your cat? Bring it out, and let me kill it!”

He still remembered his hatred for Lil’ Red, and he wanted to take revenge. This was the reason why he rejoiced when he saw Lin Yun. On the other hand, Mo Yun wore a grave expression because he knew how strong Lin Yun was.

As the Demonic Rune Tiger ran over, Lil’ Red, who was on its back, hopped onto Lin Yun’s shoulder and asked, “Big Brother, what do you have in mind?”

“One each.” Lin Yun replied. These two people were a little disgusting if they joined forces, but it was much easier to deal with them if they fought one-on-one.

“Hehe, alrighty.” Lil’ Red’s eyes shone as it disappeared from Lin Yun’s shoulder, pouncing at Dong An.

This made Dong An squint his eyes. He could feel an extremely dangerous aura. But the cat had disappeared from his eyes. Its speed was so fast that he couldn’t keep up.

Just when he felt uncertain, he was soon enveloped in a shadow, and his face changed significantly when he raised his head. There was a black Dracoape that had reached nearly thirty-feet in height. It had crimson eyes and was enveloped in a baleful aura as it slammed down with its palm.

“You think you can crush me?” Dong An quickly retreated when Lil’ Red’s palm descended and left a huge palm print on the ground, but the shockwave sent Dong An flying away.

But Lil’ Red didn’t let Dong An go so easily. It stomped its foot on the ground before dashing over.

“Take care of my junior brother.” Lin Yun said to the Demonic Rune Tiger before he dashed over to Mo Yun. He no longer planned to hold back this time. Since they ran into each other again, he might as well just kill them.

Upon receiving Lin Yun’s orders, the Demonic Rune Tiger ran over to Chen Ling and wore a fawning smile, “Lord, stand behind me. I’ll kill whoever dares to touch you.”

As it spoke, it turned into its humanoid form wielding a saint blade, which made its fawning smile look terrifying. Seeing the Demonic Rune Tiger’s sinister fawning smile, Chen Ling’s legs began to tremble.

When Mo Yun saw Lin Yun charging over, he immediately summoned his constellation. It was a painting of a brush, and his aura began to rise with countless spiritual runes filling up the surroundings. When he waved his hand, multiple saint diagrams opened up, and thirty-six saint diagrams soon surrounded him. But he was cautious and didn’t take the initiative to attack. Instead, he set up those saint diagrams around him as a defense.

He could summon eighteen saint diagrams if he didn’t summon his constellation. But upon summoning his constellation, the number of saint diagrams was immediately doubled.

“What a tortoise shell.” Lin Yun furrowed his brows in mid-air because those saint diagrams were like a shield. Mo Yun no longer dared to attack him first after previously suffering a loss, fearing that Lin Yun would return all the saint diagrams to him.

“Are all saint spiritualists cowards like you?” Lin Yun asked.

“I dare not to be careless. I know your means, so you can come at me if you have the guts.” Mo Yun smiled with his eyes squinted. The thirty-six saint diagrams were connected, and they would all explode when Lin Yun touched even one of them.Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

At that time, even a third-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm expert would be killed. He might not be able to do anything to Lin Yun, but he also didn’t feel that Lin Yun could do anything to him. A saint spiritualist had plenty of ways if they focus on defense.

Lin Yun naturally wouldn’t fall for those words and released his sword aura, locking onto Mo Yun, not allowing him to flee.

“Ha, you want to carry on?” Mo Yun smiled. “You have no chance. When my big brother arrives, you won’t be able to leave even if you wanted to.”

His words finally made Lin Yun’s face change a little. If he remembered correctly, they still had two companions, and one was wielding a bone flute with a cultivation at the pinnacle third-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm.

While in this temporary stalemate, a commotion resounded not too far away as the Dracoape held onto a person, constantly slamming him against the ground. After turning into its Dracoape form, Lil’ Red used this brute method to humiliate Dong An.

This scene made Lin Yun’s lips twitch because Lil’ Red was really ruthless. He knew that Lil’ Red’s cultivation was even higher than his after reaching the Dragon Pulse Realm, but he didn’t expect it to be so terrifying.

Mo Yun’s face drastically changed as he yelled, “Get your pet to release him!”

“You should worry about yourself, instead.” Lin Yun waved his hand and the Flower Burial Sword flew out from the sword box. Right then, Lin Yun’s sword intent detected a wisp of dangerous aura and a bizarre flute music echoed around, accompanied by a terrifying dragon cry.

“He’s here!” Mo Yun rejoiced.

Lin Yun had experienced the same situation before. But since he was in a hurry to collect the ominous auras back then, he retreated because he didn’t want trouble. But today, no one could save them, no matter who comes. Anyone who dared to humiliate the Sword Sect’s disciples had to die!
