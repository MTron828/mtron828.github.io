Chapter 745 - Breakthrough

“A pity?” Lin Yun smiled but he didn’t reply to Long Hao.

“Let’s go. The demonic beasts near Swordmire City are a lot stronger than Inkwater City. So be careful,” said Long Hao as he looked at Lin Yun. His words weren’t fake since Lin Yun had sensed it along the way. Back in Inkwater City, he practically didn’t use his Overlord Sword aside from facing the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape. But now, he had to use it several times.

Turning back to glance at Lin Yun, the origin energy within Long Hao’s body fluctuated even more powerfully. His movement technique was fast as he left the demonic beasts in the dust.

From afar, he looked like a wandering dragon. His strength should be stronger than he had shown so far, which meant that the Sword Alliance was a rather powerful organization. But Lin Yun had no interest in it nor did he intend to interact much with this person.

Just when Lin Yun was distracted, another group of demonic beasts charged over and pounced at Lin Yun. Drawing his sword, a terrifying sword ray radiated from Lin Yun’s sword before manifesting into lightning, “Thunderbolt Slash!”

When he swung his sword out, he emitted a terrifying dominance that instantly tore dozens of demonic beasts apart, but there was still one demonic beast that charged towards Lin Yun.

Lin Yun raised his sword to stab the demonic beast once more. His sword ray flashed and he stabbed the soft meat on the demonic beast’s neck. His keen sword intent allowed him to find the demonic beast’s weakness. He attacked with his instinct and moved decisively.

But the Flower Burial Sword was blocked after stabbing half an inch. After that, his sword couldn’t move any further no matter how hard he tried. This made him frown his brows as he looked at the bear demonic beast with surprise in his eyes.

This was a Demonrock Bear, a Yin-Yang stage demonic beast. But under the influence of the ominous aura, it had actually reached the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm. Then again, it must have made a breakthrough not long ago. Otherwise, it wouldn’t take this long for Lin Yun to discover it.

He instantly knew that he was careless. He should’ve known that this demonic beast wasn’t easy since it could survive his Thunderbolt Flash.

Pushing his movement technique to the limit, Lin Yun retreated as the Demonrock Bear roared furiously, destroying several of Lin Yun’s afterimages before hitting Lin Yun. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Four gashes appeared on Lin Yun’s chest from the attack. If he didn’t retreat fast enough and if he didn’t have the Azure Dragon Mark, this claw would’ve instantly shattered his heart.

The closer he got to Swordmire City, the more terrifying the demonic beasts were. But the bloodline of this Demonrock Bear was too weak compared to the overlord Mountainshaking Demonic Ape. But since he ran into this Demonrock Bear, he might as well kill it.

He had never killed a quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beast before, so he could train his current strength with this Demonrock Bear. Even if he couldn’t face this Demonrock Bear, he was confident that he could easily retreat.

Lin Yun raised his brow and circulated the Iris Sword Sutra. Silver origin energy filled his body so much that it even shrouded him in a silver glow. As his sword aura surged once more, he unleashed dozens of attacks at the Demonrock Bear.

The demonic beast was fast despite its bloated size, so much so that it even left afterimages behind due to its speed. Furthermore, its attacks were powerful and it were comparable to a genuine quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm expert.

But Lin Yun was still caught by surprise as his sword aura was crushed in the blink of an eye. This had also finally caused Lin Yun’s face to change. After all, if his sword aura was destroyed, it would practically mean death. “Not good!”

The Demonrock Bear was huge and the demonic aura from its claw nearly tore space apart. The bear truly wanted to destroy Lin Yun’s remaining sword aura.

Overlord Sword—Breaking Dawn!

Lin Yun’s mind was unprecedentedly concentrated as a crimson ray shot out of his Flower Burial Sword. At the same time, a blazing fireball descended from the sky as it broke through the darkness.

The sword ray and fireball collided with the Demonrock Bear’s claw. As origin energy exploded out, Lin Yun was sent a few hundred meters away with traces of blood leaking from his lips.

“Interesting. I have really underestimated the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm. Even if it’s just a demonic beast, I can’t be careless.” Lin Yun wiped the blood off his lips and looked at the Demonrock Bear that was also knocked a few hundred meters back.

If it weren’t for his recent improvements, he would be defeated by a single attack if he were to face a genius in the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm. He would have been caught by surprise and would have suffered a loss since he didn’t realize how terrifying the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm was.

The beast tide was a huge opportunity for him. Both the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape and the Demonrock Bear had given him a clear understanding of quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm geniuses.

Qing Ruoyou’s strength should be at the same level as the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape. As for the Demonrock Bear, it was still too weak compared to Qing Ruoyou. If it wasn’t for Lin Yun’s carelessness, he wouldn’t have been injured in the first place.

“Let me take a look at how powerful the quasi-spiritual sword intent is!” Lin Yun’s sword aura began to boil as he unleashed his aura. The fireflies around him that only swordsmen could see became visible this time.

When the Demonrock Bear sensed Lin Yun’s sword intent, it felt threatened and its black aura continued to accumulate. In the next second, a sonic boom exploded out as it charged over like a comet.

“You came at the right time!” Lin Yun’s pupils blazed with fighting spirits as he swung his sword out. The fireflies around him were like moths as they gathered onto the bright light of the Flower Burial Sword. They, as the sword brilliantly shined, Lin Yun slashed his sword down as if he were about to tear space apart.

His sword radiated brightly in the sky as it drew several long cracks in the demonic clouds. His sword ray tore a huge gash on the Demonrock Bear’s chest, causing blood to spray everywhere. Then, the Demonrock Bear was sent flying before it crashed into the ground.

But it was still ultimately a quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beast. This attack wasn’t fatal, so the Demonrock Bear jumped back up. A black sphere appeared on its palm before it blazed into black flames. Then, the flames turned into a spear that was aimed at Lin Yun.

“Slash!” Empowered by the quasi-spiritual sword intent, Lin Yun’s sword crushed the spear that was condensed from the black flames.

Executing the Seven Profound Steps, the black flames exploded and caused a huge crater on the ground as Lin Yun spread his arms and stabbed the bear.

The stab created a hole on the Demonrock Bear’s chest. But just when he was about to draw his sword out, the Demonrock Bear seemed to have gone insane as it grabbed onto the Flower Burial Sword and lowered its head to bite Lin Yun’s neck.

Lin Yun immediately let go of his sword as the dragon runes began to squirm on the surface of his body, gathering all his azure dragon energy into his right fist. As a dragon roar echoed out from his right fist, lightning began to crackle violently as his punch landed on the Demonrock Bear’s head.

The Demonrock Bear was sent flying a few hundred meters. The black miasma began to leak out of the beast, but Lin Yun didn’t stop. His eyes flashed coldly as he punched the Flower BUrial Sword’s handle.

The Flower Burial Sword turned into a red streak that pierced through the Demonrock Bear’s chest. This made the Demonrock Bear furious as it smashed its claw forth. But its claw was only able to tear apart the edge of Lin Yun’s clothes.

When the Demonrock Bear fell to the ground, Lin Yun waved his hand and summoned the sword from the bear’s chest. As the body of the sword buzzed, Lin Yun could feel a deeper connection with the sword when he held onto it.

“Big Bang!” Before the Demonrock Bear could turn around, a dazzling ball of lightning landed down on the bear’s head, crushing its skull into fragments. The once strong defence had already been penetrated by Lin Yun’s punch.

When the Demonrock Bear fell down lifelessly, black miasma began to dissipate from the bear’s body. The instant the Demonrock Bear died, Lin Yun relaxed his mind and he felt a warm current flowing through his violet palace.

The origin energy in his violet palace began to boil as it was a few times more refined than before. The silver origin energy became like mercury and was a lot denser than before. The surface of his body glowed as he had undergone a transformation from inside out.

“I made a breakthrough?” Lin Yun had reached the greater Yin-Yang stage. Compared to the lesser Yin-Yang stage, his origin energy had undergone a tentative transformation. But it was a little too late. If he made a breakthrough in the middle of the battle, he wouldn’t have needed to use the quasi-spiritual sword intent to kill the Demonrock Bear.

Right at this moment, beast roars began to ring out from a few hundred miles away and the soundwave from their roars made the surrounding air fluctuate. When Lin Yun raised his head, the demonic cloud in the sky became even denser.

He could sense a terrifying aura in the distance, which came from many demonic beasts who were comparable to the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape. There was even a demonic beast with an aura that was more terrifying than the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape. Under its aura, the demonic clouds in the sky began to roll violently.

“The Beast King has arrived?” Lin Yun’s face changed. From Long Hao, he got to know that Beast King was a quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beast comparable to those in the Heavenly Soul Realm. If he ran into the Beast King, there was no doubt that he would be killed in just ten moves.

If he ran into it in the past, he would be killed instantly. The beast tide of this scene was terrifying and this was just the beginning. Lin Yun wouldn’t be surprised to see Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beasts appearing as time passed.

“I need to enter the city first.” Lin Yun headed towards Swordmire City without any hesitation. But he didn’t go far before he saw several figures soaring into the sky and landing on the city gate. They were all youths who emitted terrifying fighting spirits.

Lin Yun came to a stop as he looked at those figures. They seemed to be here for the Beast King as they didn’t even bother retracting their aura. Lin Yun’s eyes flickered as he muttered, “Monstrous geniuses on the Dragoncloud Ranking?”
