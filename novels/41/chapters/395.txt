Chapter 396 - Reflection Cliff

It only took an instant before he arrived in front of Qin Yu. Gathering all his origin energy, he sent his palm out at Qin Yu. Before his palm even landed on the ground, the ground was covered in cracks as pieces of rocks flew around.

The smile disappeared on Qin Yu’s face and his attitude underwent a change. A dazzling radiance exploded from within his body as he sent out a blazing palm.

A blazing heatwave exploded from his palm and its dazzling radiance was as blinding as the sun. His attack also contained an overwhelming dominance.

When the two palms collided, Wang Tian took several steps back. When he landed on the ground, he looked at Qin Yu with shock.

“Wang Tian, have you forgotten that I’m also one of the eight titles?” questioned Qin Yu.

“Earth grade cultivation technique!” Wang Tian looked at Qin Yu with shock. From the palm, he could sense that Qin Yu had cultivated an earth grade cultivation technique.

After all, he was the Wang Clan’s patriarch who had been in the Violet Palace Realm for a long time. He was way stronger than any ordinary cultivators in the Violet Palace Realm. But how did Qin Yu manage to cultivate an earth grade cultivation technique at his cultivation?

All earth grade cultivation techniques had a harsh requirement, so it wasn’t easy to practice even for cultivators in the Violet Palace Realm. Just how powerful was Qin Yu?

Wang Tian felt helpless and fearful. The reason why he attacked Qin Yu was because the death of Wang Yan had temporarily consumed his rationale. Now that he regained his rationale, he couldn’t believe what he just did. He just attacked the prince of the Great Qin Empire! That was a crime punishable by the annihilation of nine generations of bloodline!

Wang Tian immediately got down on his knees, “Please forgive my crimes, Your Highness!”

“What crimes do you have?” The coldness disappeared from Qin Yu’s face and he smiled, “Uncle Wang, we were just having a friendly spar. Can it be that you really wanted to kill me?”

“No. Definitely not. Your Highness is powerful and you’ll definitely become the champion in the Dragon Gate Competition this year,” said Wang Tian as he changed his tone immediately.

“Go back. I will give you an explanation for Wang Yan’s death, but not now. Understood?” said Qin Yu.

“Your servant will take his leave immediately.” Wang Yan didn’t dare to reply to those words. He immediately left with the Wang Clan’s party.

“That old dog still cowered in the end. At least he’s not stupid…” An old black-clothed man appeared beside Qin Yu as he looked at the Wang Clan’s party coldly.

Qin Yu didn’t speak a word and rubbed his nose. His finger was stained with blood and his face turned dark when he saw the bloodstain. It was weird for someone to be bleeding from the nose for no reason.

“The Profound Yang Art is too harsh on your body. Try to avoid using it as much as possible…” The black-clothed man had no expression when he saw this scene. Every cultivation technique has had a harsh requirement since ancient times, so the outcome would be terrible for anyone to try and practice them recklessly.

Looking at the bloodstain on his finger, Qin Yu said in a solemn voice, “The Dragon Gate Competition is filled with geniuses. How can I stand out from the masses if I don’t take an extreme path? But the Profound Yang Art still isn’t stable enough. We have to push forward with our plan now. Let me know immediately when Xin Yan wakes up!”

“As you wish.” The black-clothed old man disappeared as if he had never appeared in the first place. When the Azure Association’s members and the royal guards came over, Qin Yu returned to his usual self.

The Repent Cliff was a special place in the Sword Firmament Pavilion. This was a place where geniuses were locked up. For ordinary disciples, they would either be imprisoned or sent to the Herbal Peak.

This place was heavily secured and the security here was heavier than many other places in the sect. It was in no way inferior to the security at the Contribution Hall and Martial Hall.

Escaping this place was harder than trying to ascend heaven. If anyone was found trying to escape, the deacons stationed here would kill them at the first sign. The front of the cliff was a bottomless abyss and the cliff had nothing but dried-up trees.

Within the Repent Cliff, Guardian Plum explained the rules to Lin Yun. Waving his hand to dismiss the deacons who followed them, Guardian Plum asked, “No one’s here. You can tell me why you killed Wang Yan now.”

Guardian Plum believed that Lin Yun had his reasons for killing Wang Yan. After all, the recklessness of killing someone in the sect was unlike Lin Yun.

Lin Yun didn’t give a reply directly and retrieved a needle instead. This was the needle that Wang Yan first dodged.

“What is this?” asked Guardian Plum

“A Bloodrain Silverneedle,” replied Lin Yun.

“That’s impossible…” Guardian Plum’s face changed. He naturally knew about the Bloodrain Silverneedle, but it was already long gone from the surface of the earth because it was too sinister. So something like this shouldn’t have appeared in the Great Qin Empire.

After all, artifacts from the Heaven Mechanism Gate were rare and they would be gone once they were used up. They could hardly be found in the Ancient Southern Domain, not to mention the Great Qin Empire.

“You’ll know if you give it a try,” said Lin Yun.

The needle disappeared from Lin Yun’s hand and appeared in Guardian Plum’s. He gently pricked himself with the needle and noticed his blood turning black. He confirmed, “It’s indeed the Bloodrain Silverneedle.”

“Back in the Extermination Mountain Range, the person who fired the needles might have been masked, but I recognized his gaze. It was Wang Yan. I tried testing him with the needle earlier today and he managed to call out the name of this needle.”

“Are you sure about that?” questioned Guardian Plum.

“I am,” said Lin Yun.

Guardian Plum’s face turned dark upon hearing it. It was impossible for Wang Yan to know something like the Bloodrain Silverneedle. Not only Wang Yan, but not many elders in the Violet Palace Realm didn’t know about it either.

“This is why you killed him? You couldn’t report it to the sect. There was no need for you to take actions personally.”

“I already considered that, but this isn’t exactly ironclad evidence. It would only alarm Wang Yan instead. I already wasted ten days in the Sword Burial Woodsand I couldn’t let Wang Yan live anymore,” said Lin Yun without any expression on his face.

Guardian Plum was left speechless because what Lin Yun said was right. It was practically impossible for the sect to kill Wang Yan because of that. He now knew why Lin Yun would choose to execute Wang Yan publicly. There were many things that the sect couldn’t do even if they knew about the truth.

But Lin Yun had taken revenge on Wang Yan personally. At the very least, Wang Yan was slain by his sword.

“You can choose to take two things from your belongings aside from weapons.” Guardian Plum changed the topic and took out Lin Yun’s interspatial pouch. This was an exception that he was making for Lin Yun. Normally speaking, those who were punished to the Repent Cliff couldn’t bring anything along with them.

Lin Yun fell into deep thought before he retrieved the Great Wind Scripture and the Azure Transcript.

“Have you ever considered the fact that Wang Yan might be a chess piece and that the mastermind was someone?” Guardian Plum asked.

“I did. Senior Brother said before his death that someone didn’t want him to appear at the Dragon Gate Competition at the end of this year. I believe you know more than me,” said Lin Yun.

Judging from what Luo Feng said, the death of Xin Jue wasn’t so simple.

“So what if I know about it?” Guardian Plum smiled bitterly and sighed, “Don’t blame the Pavilion Master. He was trying to protect you. It’s a long story that I can’t explain in a few words. But you have to know something. You might be the next one to be killed since you were too dazzling. Perhaps you’ll be safer if you draw the attention away from yourself.” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Even with one of my profound veins crippled?” Lin Yun smiled mockingly.

“That’s right. Even if you crippled a profound vein,” said Guardian Plum with a grave expression. He looked around the Repent Cliff and continued, “Many ancestors stayed in the Repent Cliff. Some went insane, some lost their rationale, and some managed to be reborn.”

A long time later, he turned back to Lin Yun and said, “Take care of yourself.”

When Lin Yun was left alone in the Repent Cliff, he could sense the endless loneliness overwhelming him. Even the breeze here felt so desolate.

Lin Yun sat with his legs crossed as he started healing his injuries. He was heavily injured because one of his profound veins were crippled. This meant that there was no way for him to recover if he didn't settle down for a period of time. When he looked into his body, he noticed his ninth profound vein was completely shattered.

This also meant that it would be more difficult for him to reach the ninth stage of the Profound Martial Realm again. Perhaps there might not be any hope for him to reach it in many years to come.

“This is…” Right at this moment, Lin Yun was shocked because he saw three golden seals. Each golden seal contained an astronomical amount of origin energy. The quantity and quality of the origin energy far surpassed his strongest state and just one seal was comparable to his origin energy while he was in the ninth stage.

Lin Yun suddenly opened his eyes with astonishment flashing through his eyes. They were cultivation origins. This meant that the three pats from Guardian Plum weren’t so simple. But when he tried to absorb the origin energy in those seals, he encountered a resistance along with pain coming from his profound vein. He instantly realized that he could only refine them after he reformed his profound vein.

Beneath the cliff, Guardian Plum looked at the peak. He still appeared middle-aged, but he had more white hair and wrinkles on his face now. “This is all I can do to help you. You still have to depend on yourself to see if you can be reborn.”
