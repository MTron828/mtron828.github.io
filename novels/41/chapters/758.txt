Chapter 759 - What The Hell?

With the beast tide coming to an end, the geniuses who survived the battle had obtained a huge harvest. The strongest ones among them even captured aerial demonic beasts as their mounts. After all, it was exhausting for Heavenly Soul Realm experts to travel.

As for those beneath the Heavenly Soul Realm, it was hard for them to stay in the air no matter how strong they were. With an aerial demonic beast as their mount, things would be a lot more convenient for them. This was also a symbol of their strength.

After all, not everyone could obtain an aerial demonic beast as their mount. This required crushing strength to accomplish. Otherwise, it would be an impossible task that might even result in death.

When the beast tide came to an end, the geniuses started to leave the Thunder Prefecture in batches. This was a common scene above Skymound City. Every time the aerial demonic beasts flew in the sky, a decent commotion would break out. On this particular day, dozens of aerial demonic beasts flew through the sky that cast shadows on the ground.

“How strong. Those are actually Yin-Yang stage aerial demonic beasts!”

“If it wasn’t for the beast tide, it wouldn’t be easy to obtain those aerial demonic beasts. After all, the aerial demonic beasts are too agile, making them difficult to trap and almost impossible to capture.”

“What a pity that our Skymound City’s geniuses were killed by Lin Yun. Otherwise, Chen Ziyu and Chu Muyan would surely shine brightly in this beast tide.”

“They might even be able to capture a few aerial demonic beasts.” The pavilions in the city were packed with people as they looked at the aerial demonic beasts with envy. From all perspectives, having a Yin-Yang stage aerial demonic beast was a symbol of power.

When those standing on the aerial demonic beasts flew across the horizon, they looked down at everyone who was looking at them with envy. They felt proud of their accomplishments. In fact, they slowed their demonic beasts on purpose to receive more envious looks.

Having an aerial demonic beast was a symbol of their strength and status. So no one was willing to let this opportunity go. Now that they were passing over a city with many people gathered, they naturally had to show off their mounts.

“I heard that the geniuses from Skymound City were slaughtered by one person,” said a purple-clothed youth standing on an Iron-horned Falcon. He was a genius from the Indigothunder Sect, named Mu Han. He shined brightly in the final battle and obtained a great harvest in the end.

His mount was a greater Yin-Yang stage Iron-horned Falcon that he subdued with his strength. He was now rushing back to his sect after resting in Swordmire City.

“Hehe. Brother Mu, Skymound City initially had seven geniuses, but they were killed by Flower Burial Lin Yun.”

“ Lin Yun is a ruthless person. I heard he killed ten quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beasts with one sword before I arrived.”

“That’s right. He even killed an overlord Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beast, the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape.” The rest who were travelling with Mu Han were especially polite. After all, Mu Han came from an overlord force, the Indigothunder Sect. He was powerful and there were many benefits to being friends with him.

Mu Han sneered, “He killed a Mountainshaking Demonic Ape? That must be fake. You really treat rumors like that for real when you haven’t witnessed it for yourself? As for killing the seven geniuses, who the hell do they think they are? They were just a bunch of frogs in a well.”

“That’s right. I heard he only killed the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape because Qin Yang from the Profound Yang Palace heavily injured that demonic beast.”

“I heard that as well. If Qin Yang wasn’t so magnamious, he would’ve crippled Flower Burial.” Everyone laughed with Mu Han. Only one person among the group witnessed Lin Yun’s grace, so he could only force out a smile.

Right at this moment, their aerial demonic beasts began to tremble with fear. This made it difficult for the geniuses to control their mounts. No matter how hard they tried, they couldn’t calm their demonic beasts.

“What’s going on?”

“What’s wrong with these beasts? They’re not listening at all.”

“Brother Mu, look!” Right at this moment, someone raised their head and looked at the sky in shock. Without them knowing, densely packed thunderclouds were rolling over from the horizon.

“The beast tide didn’t end?” All the geniuses who went through the beast tide became uneasy as this wasn’t good news for them. It was true that they benefited greatly from the beast tide, but they definitely didn’t want to experience it again when they relied on luck to survive.

“Something’s wrong,” said Mu Han. “Those are thunderclouds, not demonic clouds.”

As soon as Mu Han finished speaking, a colossal being flew over. When the colossal being flew over, the mounts started falling out of the sky in fear. The faces of the geniuses turned pale because they would be heavily injured if they fell from this height.

Then, someone saw a figure standing on the colossal being with a purple mark on his forehead. Under Lin Yun’s gaze, the aerial demonic beasts, who were trembling in fear, managed to calm down, which saved the geniuses from falling out of the sky.

But fear still persisted in the demonic beasts and the cultivators riding them. Suddenly, someone yelled, “It’s an overlord Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beast!”

They couldn’t imagine that someone was riding on the Indigothunder Dragonvulture, an overlord Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beast.

“Where did that person come from?” All the geniuses were in fear and they didn’t dare to move. Right at this moment, five figures suddenly appeared from Skymound City, emitting powerful auras. All five of them were Heavenly Soul Realm experts who were stronger than ordinary Heavenly Soul Realm cultivators. Their aura could even stop the thunderclouds from spreading.

They were the patriarchs of the four major clans and the sect master of the Skycloud Sect. In Skymound City, they were considered to be the strongest. But the Indigothunder Dragonvulture’s reputation was famed, so they knew there was nothing they could do. Additionally, unbeknownst to them, it had become a lot more powerful after cultivating the Azure Dragon Enneaform. It was practically at the level of a monarch demonic beast or even stronger. Its torrential pressure could entirely envelop Skymound City.

As the ruler of Skymound City, the five of them definitely had to come out to determine if the approaching power was a friend or enemy. However, when they appeared before the Indigothunder Dragonvulture, they instantly recognized it as the overlord Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beast from Flamedragon Hill.

But there was something unusual about it as its aura was a lot more powerful than before. There were even purple dragon runes on its body that emanated a powerful aura. Then again, their attention was placed on the purple mist that flickered with lightning and shrouded the Indigothunder Dragonvulture’s back.

There’s someone on top of the Indigothunder Dragonvulture?! The hearts of the five old men sank. Then, Skycloud Sect’s sect master spoke, “May I know who you are? What matters do you have to come riding on this demonic beast?”

The faces of the four major clan’s patriarchs were also ugly as they never expected that someone would be directing the Indigothunder Dragonvulture. If they knew this beforehand, they wouldn’t have shown up. After all, their scalps tingled at the thought of an expert who could subdue the Indigothunder Dragonvulture.

If this expert had enmity towards Skymound City, it would be a disaster for the four clans and the Skycloud Sect. Right now, they only hoped that this expert was simply passing by.

As both parties faced each other, the atmosphere of Skymound City became more tense. The people of Skymound City were shocked that the Indigothunder Dragonvulture would come to their city. When they heard the Skycloud Sect’s sect master’s words, their faces changed once again because they never expected that someone would be on top of the Indigothunder Dragonvulture.

“Interesting. You guys actually can’t recognize me anymore?” A figure slowly stood up from the Indigothunder Dragonvulture as the purple mist dissipated. Lin Yun’s signature look of azure colored clothing and a sword box on his back was revealed. His face was instantly recognized by everyone in Skymound City.

It was Lin Yun. His voice wasn’t loud, but everyone in Skymound City could hear him. Mu Han nearly fell off his aerial demonic beast because he had just badmouthed Lin Yun. Yet here he was, on the back of an overlord Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beast.

The Skycloud Sect’s sect master was completely dumbfounded by this scene. The patriarchs of the four clans wore an ugly expression because they never would have imagined that Lin Yun was on top of the Indigothunder Dragonvulture.

The Falling Aquatic Empyrean was also shocked by this scene as he watched from the Falling Aquatic Mountain. The Indigothunder Dragonvulture was a powerful demonic beast with the noble bloodline of the dragon clan. It could be ranked among the top in the entire Ancient Southern Domain and he even had thoughts of subduing this demonic beast to guard his mountain years ago. But it was a shame that this demonic beast was too cunning.

Whenever it sensed his aura, it would flee deep into the mountain. So the Falling Aquatic Empyrean gave up after several tries. Furthermore, he would also have to pay a price to subdue the Indigothunder Dragonvulture with his strength.

So he never expected that this demonic beast would actually follow Lin Yun. He could also tell that this demonic beast had evolved into a monarch demonic beast, which shocked him even more.

Previously, he looked down on Lin Yun because he couldn’t figure out what charm Lin Yun had to attract the holy maiden of the Profound Imperial Palace. But now, a monarch demonic beast was actually following Lin Yun? Just what the hell was going on?!

Falling Aquatic Empyrean’s lips twitched as he couldn’t help cursing inwardly.
