Chapter 1712 – West Garden Banquet

After Gu Jun moved, the faces of Liu Chenxin and the two old men beside him immediately changed. The two old men wanted to pull Liu Chenxin back as their hands fell onto his shoulder.

Then, they released a powerful aura, surprising Lin Yun because they were both At the Nirvana Stage. A Nirvana Stage expert was a peak master in the Sword Sect, and Liu Chenxin actually had two Nirvana Stage experts as his guards. This further showed the terrifying foundation of the Liu Saint Clan.

But even with the protection of two Nirvana sStage experts, Liu Chenxin’s body flew over, bringing the two old men over as well.

“Leave with the Third Young Master!” The old man on the left made a decision, and he loosened his hand on Liu Chenxin’s shoulder. His body began distorting like a wave, and his entire body turned into black liquid. As the black liquid wriggled, it turned into a black venomous python, and it reached Gu Jun.

The venomous python roared and spat out a mouthful of black venom. The venom was terrifying, not to mention after it had fused with Flame Intent. When it spat out, it became a black venomous flame.

“So you’re actually a beast!” Gu Jun sneered. He ignored the black venomous flame, and his hand continued to reach out toward Liu Chenxin.

When everyone was puzzled, three figures appeared behind Gu Jun, one playing the zither, one playing the flute, and one playing the drum. When the music resounded, the venomous flames were extinguished before they could even get close.

After losing a protector, Liu Chenxin’s figure was immediately dragged over to Gu Jun. Before Liu Chenxin could even beg for mercy, his right hand was quickly ripped off.

The pain made Liu Chenxin scream with his face distorted. His body trembled as blood splashed out from his wound as he laid on the ground.

“What?” The two old men were shocked, and their pupils were filled with fear when they looked at Gu Jun, who was holding onto a severed arm.

“Watch yourselves next time. If you want to beat a dog, you should look at the owner.” Gu Jun said coldly. “Lin Xiao is the disciple of my Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s Saint Elder, and this arm is a lesson to you. Get the senior of your clan to come and pick it up from the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion.”

The corner of Lin Yun’s lip twitched, and he glared at Gu Jun.

“My arm! Return my arm!” Liu Chenxin sent a furious look at Gu Jun. He wanted to crawl over to his arm, but the two old men stopped him.

“Let’s go!” The two old men were decisive and quickly left, knowing they couldn’t beat Gu Jun. After all, Gu Jun was at the pinnacle of the Nirvana Stage.

An expert of this level was rare in Heavenly Domain City. This was because this person was the strongest in the city as long as Saints didn’t appear.

Looking at Gu Jun carefully freezing the arm, Lin Yun asked, “You should be able to exchange quite a bit of Profound Saint Pellets with this arm, right?”

Having his thoughts exposed, Gu Jun’s face turned red, and he refuted, “Don’t slander me. I’m taking revenge for you!”

“What about that ‘If you want to beat a dog, you should look at the owner’, then?” Lin Yun asked coldly.

“That was an accident, an accident.” Gu Jun coughed.

“Let’s go. This place isn’t safe, and the Liu Clan’s men might arrive here anytime.” Gu Jun quickly left this place with Lin Yun. When they crossed a river, Lin Yun noticed a massive courtyard at the far end of the river.

The Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion only had thirty-six mountains, and this courtyard had over forty hovering mountains. Towering walls surrounded the outer region, and the courtyard gate wasn’t far from the river.

Many boats were going back and forth, and they could see many extraordinary-looking people entering the gate. The entire courtyard looked majestic, and it was hard for anyone to imagine that someone could occupy such a massive region in the Heavenly Domain City.

If one looked at it closely, a Saint probably created this river since it had perfectly fused with the surrounding sceneries.

“What place is this?” Lin Yun asked.

“That’s the Liu Clan.” Gu Jun answered.

“What day is it today? Why are there so many people entering the Liu Clan?” Lin Yun asked. He could tell that the guests entering the Liu Clan weren’t simple.

“It should be the West Garden Banquet of the Wind Edge Lord. After the Empress granted him the title of Wind Edge Lord, he would hold a banquet in his residence every year at this time.” Gu Jun replied. “I’m afraid the banquet this time isn’t simple since it’s close to the Nirvana Banquet. All the famous musical houses in the Vermillion Bird District are invited here. Even the geniuses of the six holy lands might be here, and this Wind Edge Lord has a huge connection.”

“The Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion isn’t invited?”

“How is that possible?” Gu Jun smiled. “This Wind Edge Lord has a huge ambition to support a musical house to replace the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion. He’s the one who’s behind the Exquisite Court’s previous challenge.”

“What is this person planning?” Lin Yun muttered.

“Our Profound Fairy, what else? I heard that he fell for our Profound Fairy at first sight, and he resorted to force after being rejected several times.” Gu Jun replied.

A chill flashed across Lin Yun’s pupils, but he shook his head, “How can a person of his caliber be so impulsive over a woman?”

“Of course he’s not. I heard he has been after the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s position as one of the Four Musical Houses. Suppose the musical house he supports manages to replace the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion. In that case, he’ll have a quota to participate in the Nirvana Banquet and form a relationship with the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion. The Divine Dragon Empire is very interested in the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion.” Gu Jun smiled. “He won’t give up, even after the Exquisite Court was chased away by you. The Nirvana Banquet is only a few months away, so he won’t stay still!”

Lin Yun’s eyes flickered, and he fell into deep thoughts. A brief moment later, he said, “Since we’re here, let’s go and take a look, then.”

“Are you courting death? This is the residence of the Liu Clan, the residence of an Ancient Saint Clan. I won’t be able to protect you in there.” Gu Jun said in shock.

Lin Yun glanced at Gu Jun and said, “Don’t bother acting. Isn’t this the reason why you brought me here? As you wish, then. Furthermore, we can’t wait for them to knock on our doors, right? Since we’re going to face them sooner or later, there’s no harm in meeting the Wind Edge Lord now.”

Gu Jun was briefly stunned before he smiled, “When are we going?”

“When night comes.” Lin Yun said and closed his eyes to meditate.

This surprised Gu Jun because he did want to probe Lin Yun. But he never expected Lin Yun to see through his intentions so easily. Not only did Lin Yun see through his intentions, but he could maintain his composure. This proved that Lin Yun wouldn’t be a simple figure in the future.

When night came, Lin Yun crossed the river and reached the gate. The Liu Saint Clan was bustling with people due to the arriving guests, and Lin Yun knew that they were all geniuses who were invited, including the geniuses of the six holy lands.

Standing outside the Liu Saint Clan, Lin Yun finally knew where this Wind Edge Lord got the confidence to scheme against the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion. Amongst the guests, Lin Yun could see a group of musicians entering the Liu Clan’s residence.

He took out the Thunderstorm Zither and concealed his aura with the Divine Tortoise Transformation before mixing into the crowd and entering the Liu Clan’s residence.

“Did you see another person entering the Orchid Creek Valley?”

“Your eyes must be messing with you. Who dares to cause trouble at the West Garden Banquet?”

“Oh, yeah.” The guard no longer dwelled on that because there were too many people today.

Just like that, Lin Yun smoothly made it into the Liu Clan’s residence.

“Which junior brother are you? Why haven’t I seen you before?” A woman beside Lin Yun suddenly asked.

“Senior Sister Yun Xi, it’s natural that you’ve never seen me before, but I’ve seen you from afar. You can just call me Lil’ Lin. I’ve just joined the Orchid Creek Valley for six months.” Lin Yun smiled. He had heard someone calling this woman’s name earlier, so he remembered her name. He practically remembered everyone’s name in the Orchid Creek Valley in such a short period.

“Is that so? Then I look forward to your performance. Don’t make a mistake and embarrass the Orchid Creek Valley before the Wind Edge Lord.” Yun Xi no longer doubted Lin Yun after hearing his natural response.

“What kind of person is the Wind Edge Lord?” Lin Yun asked.

“The Wind Edge Lord is extraordinary. Although his main focus is on martial dao, he’s also proficient in music dao and has collected many ancient scores. He’s after the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion position as one of the Four Musical Houses since it has declined of over the years. He intends to conform all the musical houses in the Vermillion Bird District to pull the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion down.” Yun Xi smiled.

Lin Yun was surprised because that intention was too obvious. He couldn’t help asking, “Did the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion do anything wrong?”

“The Wind Edge Lord wanted to spar with the Profound Fairy several times, but she wasn’t even willing to meet him. That’s the same as disregarding the Wind Edge Lord!” Yun Xi said curiously.

Lin Yun smiled when she said that and finally knew that Yun Xi was an admirer of the Wind Edge Lord. After all, why did Yue Weiwei have to put the Wind Edge Lord in her eyes?

“But I heard someone impressive joined the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion recently. The Exquisite Court went to challenge them, but they were all defeated by a person called Lin Xiao. I wonder how this person looks, and he must be ugly.” Yun Xi was an extrovert and chatted about many things with Lin Yun during this time.

Hearing what Yun Xi said, Lin Yun merely responded with a smile. Half an incense’s time later, they were finally brought to where the West Garden Banquet was being held, the West Garden of the Liu Clan’s residence.
