Chapter 1542 - Saint's Battle

Lin Yun was in a daze as he looked in the direction that Mu Xuankong left.

“Junior Brother Lin?”

“Junior Brother Lin?” The sisters exchanged a glance and were both surprised. They didn’t expect the change in Lin Yun’s emotions would be greater than theirs when the sect master left. Could it be that there was something they didn’t know about?

When Lin Yun came to his senses, he smiled, “I still have some matters to attend to. So I’ll take my leave first and be in seclusion for some time.”

The two sisters nodded while falling into deep thoughts, looking at Lin Yun’s silhouette.

“Big Sister, don’t you feel that Junior Brother Lin has changed a lot? This is weird… but I can’t describe it in words. It looks like he’s more concerned about father leaving the sect than us.” Mu Qingqing was baffled as she held onto her chin.

“He became more unfathomable, and I feel that his cultivation isn’t just at the five-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm.” Mu Xueqin replied.

“Are you serious? I remember that he was only at the pinnacle two-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm when he left the sect. It’s already unbelievable that he can reach the five-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm in just four months!” Mu Qingqing exclaimed.

Can it be that I’m wrong? Mu Xueqin fell into deep thoughts. “I might be wrong. Let’s put that aside for now. I’ll go around and ask why my father left the sect!”

Regardless of whether it was Mu Xueqin or Mu Qingqing, they were both nervous and could only toss the change on Lin Yun’s face aside.

Back on the Divine Firmament Peak, Lin Yun came to Martial Hall’s Nether Palace. In the sealed palace, there was a grey-clothed elder with his face covered in wrinkles.

“Greetings, Martial Uncle!” Lin Yun cupped his hands.

“Mhm?” The old man glanced at Lin Yun. He wasn’t bothered, initially, but he was soon shocked and smiled, “It looks like that lad, Mu Chuan, taught you the Black Tortoise Breathing.”

“Martial Uncle also knows about this breathing technique?”

“After all, it’s connected to the inheritance of the Black Tortoise. Mu Chuan discussed it with me. But it’s a pity that I can’t see through that tortoiseshell and I feel that an opportunity is needed to complete it.” The old man smiled. When he was done speaking, he looked at Lin Yun. “Why did you come to look for me?”

“I’m here for the next section of the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra.” Lin Yun replied.

“You condensed the Nether Sword Seed?”

“Yeah. Take a look, Martial Uncle.” Lin Yun formed seals with his hands, and a twelve-petaled netherflower appeared between them when he was done. There was a sword that looked simple and vivid with the flower bud.

“The Divine Nether Sword, not bad.” The old man smiled. He was smiling from the bottom of his heart this time, which made Lin Yun’s heart tremble. This was because his martial uncle looked older than his master. This made him think of his master and Mu Xuankong, who probably went to take revenge for him.

He knew that he owed the Sword Sect a lot, and the fluctuation within his emotions made the sword start to tremble, appearing like it would collapse at anytime.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“What are you thinking about?” The old man glared at Lin Yun and waved his hand as all the petals flew into his body.

“Sorry about that. Sorry about that.” Lin Yun scratched his head. He soon cleared his mind because he was here for the next section of the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra. His martial uncle might not hand it to him if his performance wasn't good.

“Looking at the state of your heart… Come and look for me after you’ve reached the Dragon Pulse Realm.” The old man said.

Lin Yun’s emotions fell to rock bottom, and he couldn’t say a word when he heard that.

“What happened? Share them with me. Why do you have so much hidden within your heart at such a young age?” The old man revealed an amicable smile. “Don’t worry. I can’t leave the Nether Palace, so I can keep your secrets.”

Taking a deep breath, Lin Yun shared his experience with his martial uncle, starting from the Dragon Remnant Astral Realm.

“I see… looks like Senior Brother doesn’t have much time left.” The old man sighed. When he looked at Lin Yun, he smiled because Lin Yun looked like pure jade in his eyes.

“Martial Uncle, is it hard for Master to make a breakthrough?” Lin Yun asked nervously.

Dustlight didn’t answer that question and changed the topic, “I know that you have many things pent up within your heart. Are you feeling helpless? Regardless if it was towards Feng Jue, your master, or Mu Xuankong? Many things have started because of you, but you can do nothing to help.”

“Martial Uncle!” Lin Yun looked at the old man because those words struck the depth of his soul, as if he was being seen through.

“You silly lad.” The old man smiled. “My senior brother has protected the Sword Sect for two thousand years after he became a saint. Even now that he’s only left with a few years, he’s still trying his best. Mu Xuankong is the sect master but still left the sect in a fury. Feng Jue’s talent is lacking, but he put his life on the line to protect you. Do you know why?”

“Why?”

“For the Sword Sect!” The old man answered. “Eight thousand years of reign with our halo enveloping ninety thousand miles. As long as the moon exists, the Sword Sect never dies. Three thousand years ago, when the Sword Sect fell from being a holy land, every disciple was required to make that oath when they joined the sect to bring the Sword Sect back to a holy land one day.

“They see hope in you and will naturally do their best to help you, regardless of whether it’s my senior brother, Mu Xuankong or Feng Jue, they’re doing their best to bring the Sword Sect back to being a holy land. This is the dao of the Sword Sect and the dao of swordsmen like us. As swordsmen, we just wish to have a clear conscience.”

Lin Yun’s eyes flickered, and his emotions recovered a little.

“Lin Yun, let me ask you. Do you have guilt in your heart? Let’s not mention guilt towards the Sword Sect. I only want to ask if you feel guilty about the sword in your hand?”

“I…” Lin Yun wanted to reply, but he soon thought of something, and flames blazed in his pupils. Wielding the Flower Burial Sword, he said without a hint of hesitation in his tone, “I have no guilt!”

“Since the Sword Sect didn’t wrong you and you didn’t wrong the sword in your hand, why are you so worried, then?” The old man smiled.

“Thank you, Martial Uncle.” Lin Yun’s thoughts have cleared up, and he found his heart as a swordsman becoming brighter than before.

“Take it. The Dragon Pulse Realm and Samsara Edict Realm sections of the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra correspond to the fourth to the twelfth stages.” The old man waved his hand and handed two scrolls to Lin Yun with a grave expression.

“The Samsara Edict Realm section as well?” Lin Yun exclaimed.

“It’s so that you don’t keep making a trip over. But if you want to visit me, I will welcome you anytime.” The old man smiled.

Lin Yun suddenly recalled something right then and asked, “I previously ran into the Netherworld Hall’s disciples and realized that their cultivation techniques are somewhat similar to the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra.”

“Haha.” The old man smiled when Lin Yun mentioned the Netherworld Hall. “Have you seen the name of this palace?”

Lin Yun was instantly alarmed because both names were similar in terms of words. Was that a coincidence?

“The Netherworld Hall was a branch of the Sword Sect three thousand years ago. The current hall master of the Netherworld Hall is a traitor of the Sword Sect. But he’s pretty impressive with his own encounters and became the chief of the seven demonic sects.” Dustlight explained. “Do you know why Senior Brother is so furious? A traitor actually dared to lay their hands on the Sword Sect’s disciple.”

Lin Yun was surprised because he didn’t know that there was a story hidden behind this matter.

“Don’t overthink about it and cultivate. Just like what you answered me, don’t let the sword in your hand down.” Dustlight said.

“Thank you, Martial Uncle.” Lin Yun stowed the scrolls. He didn’t head for the Cloud Soaring Peak but the Celestial Observing Stage. When he placed the sword box down, the entire mountain swayed.

He planned to go into seclusion till the Heavenly Pool Gathering. He raised his head to see the sea of clouds where Yu Qingfeng sliced off two peaks three thousand years ago. Three thousand years later, the sword ray left behind by Yu Qingfeng had remained to benefit the Sword Sect’s disciples.

The Sword Sect had their own pride and believed that the Sword Sect’s disciples would make a comeback. What Martial Uncle Dustlight said was right. Regardless of his master, sect master, Feng Jue, or the other disciples, they were all doing what they could.

After passing through the sea of clouds, Lin Yun could feel himself falling, and it didn’t take long for him to land on the Celestial Observing Lake. Upon placing the Flower Burial Sword to the side, Lin Yun sat with his legs crossed and eyes closed.

Meanwhile, the entire Ancient Barren Domain was in an uproar because there was a blazing sun in the sky wherever Mu Xuankong moved. Since two suns have simultaneously appeared in the sky, this was a scene that could shock anyone, not to mention that one of the suns was traveling swiftly, and there seemed to be a person within the sun.

The Kings and Saints of the various forces could clearly see the person within the sun, and that person was the Sword Sect’s sect master, Mu Xuankong. This instantly lit the Ancient Barren Domain, including the other powerful sects. Even the saints became nervous.

After all, this was the first time Mu Xuankong had left the Sword Sect after becoming a Saint. Not to mention that everyone could sense Mu Xuankong’s killing intent and rage that he didn’t bother hiding.

“What’s Mu Xuankong trying to do? Is he going to start a fight between saints?” It had been years since there was a battle between saints within the Ancient Barren Domain.
