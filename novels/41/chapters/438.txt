Chapter 439 - Breakthrough

Just when Lin Yun was feeling baffled from those words, the rumbling lightning in the sky soon attracted his attention. In the next second, a silver lightning bolt tore through the thunderclouds and descended in his direction.

“Is this a test?” But in Lin Yun’s eyes, the silver bolt of lightning looked more like a sword instead. Without any hesitation, Lin Yun circulated his origin energy to protect himself.

When the lightning struck his body, he trembled and he could also feel the shake in his internal organs. When the bolt of lightning made of sword intent coursed through his body, it felt like countless swords were smashing into him and the pain he felt came from the sword intent in the lightning.

“This is…!” Lin Yun was shocked to realize that the sword intent contained traces of pure spiritual energy. However, since this place was created with sword intent, it wasn’t surprising to find spiritual energy here. The bolt of lightning was a test and at the same time, it was also his opportunity.

When he circulated the Iris Sword Sutra, the purple origin energy coursing through his body violently was swiftly being devoured. When the Iris Flower sensed the sword intent mixed with spiritual energy, it seemed rather excited. It was just like how Lin Yun refined the Swordcloud Cores back in the Union-Alliance Battle.

“Lord Thirteen is right. This place is an opportunity for me, except that it’s a little painful,” smiled Lin Yun bitterly. The name ‘Sword Burial’ was well-deserved.

After being struck by the bolts of lightning several times, Lin Yun gradually calmed down. He realized that the sword intent here was extremely nourishing to the Iris Flower and he had no idea when he last made a breakthrough in the Iris Sword Sutra.

He even refined two Violet Palace Realm beast cores, but his Iris Sword Sutra still showed no signs of making a breakthrough. He had no idea how much resources he needed to make a breakthrough, but this place was an opportunity for him.

However, the spiritual energy contained in the sword intent was too little. Lin Yun soon turned his mind to his cultivation instead. He was already in the pinnacle ninth stage, and he would have a higher odds of winning if he could reach the tenth stage.

If he couldn’t make a breakthrough with the Iris Sword Sutra, then he would rather give his cultivation a try. After Lin Yun made his decision, he absorbed the spiritual energy in the sword intent into his nine profound veins.

As he guided the spiritual energy, the spiritual energy charged through his nine profound veins. But the spiritual energy from the sword intent was too dangerous and it wasn’t easy to control. In addition to being careful, he also had to maintain the origin energy to protect his body. So Lin Yun was practically multitasking.

Sensing the violent sword intent, Lin Yun took a deep breath and continued to activate the platform beneath him. The platform continued to guide bolts of lightning down from the thunderclouds, which would continuously light up this dark world.

When the lightning exploded on the surface of Lin Yun’s body, he could sense the endlessly spiritual energy entering his body. He gnashed his teeth and bore the pain. Simultaneously, he used his origin energy to refine the spiritual energy to make a breakthrough in his cultivation.

“This isn’t enough…” The reason why Lin Yun was able to make a breakthrough previously was because he was already in the ninth stage before he crippled his profound vein. But making a breakthrough to the tenth stage was an entirely different concept. It wouldn’t be any easier than making a breakthrough in the Iris Sword Sutra.

“I just have to go for it!” Lin Yun made a decision. Just when more bolts of lightning were about to descend, Lin Yun removed the origin energy he maintained to protect himself and used his physical body to withstand the violent lightning.

If anyone was here to see Lin Yun, they would definitely be shocked. Out in the Sword Burial Woods, Lord Thirteen, who was busy cooking the fish, frowned his eyebrows when he saw a bamboo snapping all of a sudden.

“What’s that brat doing?” Lord Thirteen instantly felt a headache as he wondered if the beast core he gave to Lin Yun could save Lin Yun’s life. Logically speaking, it should allow Lin Yun to come out of the secret realm safely, but it was a different thing if Lin Yun pushed himself too far.

“Then again, if he knew how to control himself, he wouldn’t have come this far.” A bitter smile appeared on Lord Thirteen’s face.

Back in the secret realm, Lin Yun was practically on the edge of fainting from the bolts of lightning that were descending. However, he was able to withstand them with his powerful physique. Without any origin energy to protect his body, he could sense the sword intent and spiritual energy entering his body from all directions. The amount was ten times more than what he absorbed previously.

“I need to go for it. Otherwise, I won’t be able to make a breakthrough to the tenth stage.” After Lin Yun made up his mind, he circulated the Iris Sword Sutra and guided the massive spiritual energy into his profound veins. As he continued the process, he could sense a crack in his bottleneck.

With more spiritual energy entering his body, his physical body was healing at a rapid pace in order to prepare for the next bolt of lightning. He knew that it would all be easier after he endured the first batch.

Two days later, on top of the platform, Lin Yun was covered in a purple glow. His eyes were closed, but the purple light emitted from him was solely from sword intent. It wasn’t from the bolts of lightning, but it was because there was too much sword intent within his body that was starting to leak out.

It wasn’t this obvious in the beginning, but two days later, it was quite evident that his body had been enveloped like a cocoon. But even so, the bolts of lightning still continued to deliver spiritual energy into his body.

Just when the energy within Lin Yun’s body reached the limit even for the Dracophant Battle Physique, Lin Yun opened his eyes by a small gap, “Time to make a breakthrough.”

Regardless of success or failure, Lin Yun knew that it was time for him to make a decision. When Lin Yun completely opened his eyes, lightning coursed through his pupils and the sword intent around him was so dense that it could even pierce through the clouds.

Looking at the thunderclouds tumbling in the sky, Lin Yun no longer felt the same fear from the first day. He merely glanced at the thunderclouds before he closed his eyes to circulate the massive origin energy gathered within his body into his profound veins, shattering everything that stood in his way. It didn’t take long for him to reach the final hurdle.

With all the petals in bloom, the Iris Flower emitted a dazzling radiance that made Lin Yun seem like an ancient sword stabbed into the ground. When the Iris Flower blossomed, it resonated with the heaven and earth, emitting a ferocious roar that belonged to the flower. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

With a crack, the final hurdle shattered, and his profound veins lit up before the massive energy within Lin Yun’s body condensed into the tenth profound vein. Facing the surging energy, the tenth profound vein devoured it greedily. It took half an hour for Lin Yun to stabilize his cultivation in the tenth stage.

At the same time, the violent sword intent and spiritual energy disappeared. Even the Iris Flower was beginning to close its petals.

Basking in the overflowing purple light, Lin Yun finally reopened his eyes. His gaze was sharp and his eyes were like the dazzling stars in the night sky. In the next second, powerful energy coursed through his body.

Lin Yun let out a long breath and he could clearly sense that the origin energy stored in his body was twice the amount it was before. He knew that he had finally made a breakthrough, so he was more confident for the competition.

The arc of a smile slowly rose on Lin Yun’s lips. After all, he was glad that he was able to make a breakthrough. It was also thanks to the Dracophant Battle Physique that strengthened his body greatly. The amount of energy he absorbed previously was so massive that anyone else in his position would be torn into pieces.

Looking at the sky with a playful gaze, Lin Yun knew that the fourth level could no longer provide any form of training to him and he seemed to be able to proceed to the next level.

But right at this moment, he sensed a peculiar fluctuation coming from the Iris Flower in his dantian. Was it a sign of a breakthrough or was there something from the fifth level that was attracting it?
