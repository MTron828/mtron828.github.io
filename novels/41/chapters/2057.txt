Chapter 2058 - Seeing the Black Lotus Saint Physique Again

Lin Yun’s words were like a heavy hammer crushing against Feng Shengling’s chest, his face becoming ugly. The strongest genius within the past five hundred years? That meant that Ye Qingtian was invincible for the past five hundred years and the next five hundred years.

The surroundings fell silent, with no one daring to say a word. Ye Qingtian only used one sword to defeat Feng Shengling, the genius swordsman of the Hidden Sword Manor. This made everyone from the Sword Alliance wear bitter expressions. They couldn’t even feel shocked, but were in low spirits.

Feng Shengling held onto his chest with reluctance in his eyes because Ye Qingtian was too cocky. His face was pale, with the rage of flames blazing within his pupils. He gritted his teeth, “Ye Qingtian, you’re really cocky. Invincible for the past five hundred years and the next five hundred years? Why don’t you say you’re the strongest genius for the past and the next ten thousand years?!”

“The fact that I can’t see those in the Golden Era is a pity,” Lin Yun replied.

“You’re really shameless,” Feng Shengling mocked.

Lin Yun was briefly stunned before he said, “You misunderstood. It’s not that I feel like I can’t compete with them, but it’s a pity time cannot be rewound. It’s a pity I can’t meet them, and they can’t know how cocky I am.”

Feng Shengling was dumbfounded and didn’t know what to say, his eyes nearly bulging from his eye sockets. He felt that he was cocky enough, but he didn’t dare to say those words. Not only him but everyone in the surroundings were also dumbfounded because no one probably could find someone so arrogant in the history of the Sword Assembly. Even Jian Jingtian wasn’t as arrogant as this person.

“This fellow is really cocky,” Feng Shengling muttered to himself.

“Still not going to admit defeat?” Lin Yun looked at Feng Shengling.

Feng Shengling was stubborn deep in his bones, and he gritted his teeth, “So what if I don’t admit defeat? You want to kill me?”

“Not really. If you’re unconvinced by your defeat, you can treat your injuries first and come at me again,” Lin Yun said.

Feng Shengling was stunned and began to ponder what Ye Qingtian said. Truth be told, he wasn’t convinced by Ye Qingtian’s victory because he didn’t even know how he was defeated. He still had a lot of trump cards, and he believed that he wouldn’t lose so terribly if they fought again.

But when he thought about that, Feng Shengling’s face became ugly. Since when was his mentality so weak? He was actually thinking that he wouldn’t lose so terribly if they fought again and not be defeated by Ye Qingtian.

At the palace, Feng Shaoyu’s face was pale, with beads of sweat rolling down his forehead. Ye Qingtian’s earlier attack really startled him. He saw some traces of Ye Qingtian’s sword earlier, relying on his Quasi-Saint Realm cultivation. If it was someone else, they probably couldn’t even see anything.

For the first time, he felt that the first of this Sword Assembly might fall into the hands of an outsider.

But Gu Zijing was calm as he smiled, “That fellow looks a little unfathomable. Since when did the Heavenly Dao Sect nurture such a genius?”

Feng Shaoyu was still anxious because he knew Feng Shengling would probably lose. Even if Feng Shengling didn’t admit defeat, it was still impossible for him to win. Feng Shaoyu knew how strong Gu Zijing was, and he had now placed his hopes on the latter. “Brother Gu, how can you still smile? Make a move quickly. Only you’re capable of suppressing him.”

“Relax. Brother Zhao has reached the third stage in the Black Plume Sword Canon. If he makes a move, it shouldn’t be a problem to defeat Ye Qingtian, not to mention there is a feud between Brother Zhao and Ye Qingtian. So it’s more appropriate for him to make a move instead,” Gu Zijing smiled.

Zhao Wuji indifferently said, “I’ve already grasped the Astral Sword Intent a year ago and reached lesser mastery. It’s easy for me to defeat him.”

Zhao Wuji was confident in himself. With his current cultivation at the pinnacle ninth transformation of the Nirvana Stage, he could even unleash cultivation comparable to a Quasi-Saint Realm in a crucial moment. He had a higher cultivation than Ye Qingtian, which meant he could contain more nirvana aura within his body. As long as he could bear the sword aura coming from Ye Qingtian, he could easily defeat him by relying on his cultivation alone.

“Zhao Wuji, make your move. It’ll be embarrassing if the Sword Alliance loses; we’ll all become a laughingstock,” Feng Shaoyu said.

“There’s no need to hurry. Feng Shengling looks like he still wants to fight,” Zhao Wuji smiled. He didn’t dare to look down on Ye Qingtian at this moment. Even if he had multiple advantages, it wouldn’t be easy for him to defeat Ye Qingtian.

“That fellow has hidden himself deeply.” Zhao Wuji looked at the lake. Feng Shengling treated his injuries and fought Ye Qingtian again. Feng Shengling knew he would lose but didn’t hold back in this fight and brought out all his trump cards.

But it was a pity that Feng Shengling couldn’t even touch the corner of Ye Qingtian’s clothes and was completely suppressed by him.

He’s an expert! Zhao Wuji was determined to suppress Ye Qingtian and was even going to use that opportunity to kill him. Otherwise, it would be troublesome if Ye Qingtian continued to grow.

Lin Yun finally drew his sword on the lake, striking the flaw in Feng Shengling’s attacks and sending the latter flying away. He had held back so Feng Shengling didn’t suffer any injuries and only looked tattered.

“One sword again…” Feng Shengling was in a daze with his lips trembling. He muttered, “How is this possible…? Even if I were to lose, how can I possibly not withstand a sword from you?”F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Everyone from the Sword Alliance knew that Feng Shengling couldn’t even touch Ye Qingtian throughout the fight, and they weren’t on the same level. This placed Feng Shengling in an awkward position, so he left.

Lin Yun looked at Feng Shengling, who hid himself amongst the crowd. He shook his head because that person didn’t even dare to face failure. Lin Yun was pretty fond of that person, who was cocky when he appeared and claimed to be a genius. Someone like him was how a swordsman should be. But now, he didn’t even dare to accept his failure after two defeats.

“Anyone else?” Lin Yun stood with his hands behind him.

“Me,” Zhao Wuji jumped down from the palace. When he descended, a pair of black wings appeared behind him, lifting him to the sky. Whenever he took a step forth, a lotus appeared in the air. The lotuses were formed with sword intent that looked bizarre.

When everyone saw the blooming lotuses, someone exclaimed, “Black lotuses… Is that the legendary Black Lotus Saint Physique?”

“I heard that once one reaches a certain height in the Black Plume Sword Canon, they can grasp the Black Lotus Sacred Flame and Black Lotus Saint Physique. Zhao Wuji must’ve reached a terrifying height in the Black Plume Sword Canon!”

“That should be the Black Plume Sword Canon’s movement technique, the Black Lotus Nine Transformations.”

“Zhao Wuji is finally going to make a move. He’s an influential representative from the three holy lands. With him making a move, it shouldn’t be a problem for him to suppress Ye Qingtian.”

Compared to Feng Shengling’s high profile, Zhao Wuji was more low-profiled and wasn’t as cocky as Feng Shengling. But his silence made him look even more terrifying, not to mention black lotuses that surrounded him. The aura he gave off was enough to prove that he was stronger than Feng Shengling.

“The Black Lotus Saint Physique?” Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts and noticed that the black lotuses were familiar. He had once seen someone who possessed the Black Lotus Saint Physique fighting Jin Xuanyi, but Zhao Wuji’s Black Lotus Saint Physique was on a different level.

The black lotuses seemed mysterious and looked ancient, and this wasn’t the first time Lin Yun had seen it. There was probably a Black Lotus Emperor or deity in ancient times. As a black lotus bloomed on the lake, Zhao Wuji stood on the lotus and said, “I never expected you to be so strong, and I underestimated you. You’ve fought several rounds. I won’t take advantage of you. You can rest before we fight.”

“It doesn’t matter because I hardly exhausted my strength in the previous fights,” Lin Yun said.

“Alright.” Zhao Wuji and Ye Qigntian faced off, but they weren’t in a hurry to make a move. This scene was similar to Ye Qingtian’s fight with Feng Shengling, but it was different simultaneously.

Everyone became nervous because no one was confident about the outcome, even if they had confidence in Zhao Wuji. They feared Zhao Wuji would lose like Feng Shengling and be defeated with one sword.

Suddenly, Zhao Wuji disappeared with his sword, stabbing Ye Qingtian’s throat. This made everyone exclaim, but Ye Qingtian’s figure began to fade and disappear. Zhao Wuji only managed to stab YE Qingtian’s afterimage.

Lin Yun didn’t underestimate Zhao Wuji and activated the Sword Heart. So he already sensed the danger beforehand, even before Zhao Wuiji unleashed his attack. He drew his sword and descended from the sky, swinging his sword at Zhao Wuji with an even faster speed.

Zhao Wuji noticed something wasn’t right and raised his sword before him. When Ye Qingtian’s sword clashed with his sword, they caused sparks to fly around.

Lin Yun flicked his finger with his left hand with flowers blooming on the lake and nether energy forming into a beam that was directed at Zhao Wuji’s chest.

Zhao Wuji calmly faced it and flicked his finger, blocking the incoming attack. But the huge impact created an explosion on the lake and they separated before clashing again at an even faster speed.

“Firefly Radiance!” Lin Yun and Zhao Wuji executed the Divine Firefly Sword with various phenomena blooming on the lake, leaving behind afterimages in their paths. It looked as though there were hundreds of afterimages because Ye Qingtian and Zhao Wuji were too fast. No one expected the Divine Firefly Sword to be so powerful.

Lin Yun and Zhao Wuji had fused their sword intents into their swords, drawing multiple circles and a few hundred circles on the lake.

““Myriad Swords Unite!””

Two roars echoed from the lake. As the terrifying sword intents began to converge, countless afterimages overlapped and formed into two torrential sword auras that charged at each other.

For the first time, the lake was split apart under the two powerful sword intents, creating a huge ravine.
