Chapter 847 - Fury

As the vortex on the Nine Dragon Lake began to shrink in size, the audience started to yell.

“The Dragoncloud Treasury is going to close!”

“A lot of people were eliminated. I bet those who lasted until the end had a huge harvest.”

“I wonder if any of them managed to obtain a heavenly grade martial technique. Those who came out earlier said that the treasures inside were shocking.”

“Heavenly grade martial techniques are also called fortune martial techniques. I heard that you can find them in the legendary Dragoncloud Treasury. I wonder if anyone can get through the test. After all, such fortune isn’t something that can be easily obtained.” Everyone looked at the Nine Dragon Lake with envy in their eyes. After all, this was a rare opportunity.

It was a pity that many people had been born in the same era as this year’s geniuses. If not, they might have had a chance to go in. However, it was still their honor to witness something so legendary.

Two figures flew out of the vortex first. The figures were Zhao Wuji and Yu Haotian who were both emitting violent auras. Clearly, they had a huge harvest during the time they were in the treasury. Otherwise, their aura wouldn’t be so uncontrollable. However, there was no way they would conceal themselves because they were full of pride. They wanted to show off their harvest for all to see.

It didn’t take long for Nangong Wanyu, Mu Han, and the others to appear. However, Zhao Wuji and Yu Haotian couldn’t be bothered with them as they stared at the vortex with dense killing intent in their eyes. Clearly, they were waiting for someone. Zhao Wuji even wore an annoyed expression as he had already held himself back several times from dealing with Lin Yun back in the treasury. He was tired of holding back.

“Yu Haotian and Zhao Wuji are out!”

“Their aura is so powerful. They feel a lot stronger than before. Is the treasury really that amazing?”

“Something’s not right. They seem to be waiting for Lin Yun. Can it be that Lin Yun’s harvest is worse than theirs?”

“Lin Yun didn’t have a harvest in the Dragoncloud Treasury? That doesn’t make any sense…” An uproar began to spread as the crowd looked at the killing intent in Zhao Wuji and Yu Haotian’s eyes. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The atmosphere suddenly became weird because Zhao Wuji and Yu Haotian weren’t pushovers. Furthermore, they definitely wouldn’t accept their loss to a dark horse like Lin Yun.

“What’s going on?” The faces of the Great Qin Empire party became nervous.

After Feng Ye went out to seek answers, he hesitated briefly before whispering, “I heard Wu Xiaotian and the others say that Lin Yun didn’t really have a harvest in the treasury. They said that his aura stayed the same, but they think he might have found something at the last mountain.”

“What…” Although the last part was comforting, Pavilion Master Plum still became speechless. After all, it would be troublesome if this was true. If Lin Yun’s harvest wasn’t comparable to the others, Lin Yun would be humiliated. He might even become a laughing stock if he fought them again and lost.

“A complete lesser fortune martial technique?” The sect master’s eyes lit up upon hearing Zhao Wuji’s harvest. The surrounding elders and disciples also became excited because they simply couldn’t imagine it. After all, the Violet Thunder Sect didn’t even have a fortune martial technique.

On the Indigomoon Elysium’s seats, the elders and disciples also had excitement written on their faces. While Zhao Wuji and Yu Haotian spoke to their sect masters, they would glance at the Great Qin Empire party with disdain in their eyes.

Under this bizarre atmosphere, Lin Yun and Yue Weiwei also came out of the Dragoncloud Treasury. “They’re here!”

“Lin Yun is out!”

“It doesn’t look like he had a harvest. Can it be that the rumors are true?” The appearance of Lin Yun instantly caused an uproar among the spectators because Lin Yun’s aura was well controlled. He was unlike any of the geniuses in the top ten. Those in the top ten couldn’t control their aura and they most certainly couldn’t conceal it.

Clearly, the sudden increase in strength made it hard for them to conceal their aura. Under this awkward atmosphere, Lin Yun became baffled.

“Please calm down. If you are in the top 100, please gather around.” Lin Yun didn’t have any time to figure things out as the Sacred Alliance’s judge spoke in a solemn voice. The judge was about to announce the rankings. After all, there were rumors that those in the top ten would have a huge opportunity.

When everyone gathered on the stage, Lin Yun and Yue Weiwei hesitated briefly before they followed behind everyone. After they landed on the stage, Yu Haotian and Zhao Wuji’s gaze instantly became playful as they looked at Lin Yun.

The chief judge didn’t ask everyone about their harvest in the treasury and began to announce the ranking. But he only announced the top ten rankings because the complete ranking would be spread throughout the Ancient Southern Domain at a later time. At the same time, those with their names on the ranking would also have their fame spread far and wide.

Those in the top ten would stand at the top of the pyramid as the three kings and seven elites. As for Lin Yun, there was naturally nothing to say since his performance was legendary.

But the moment the chief judge was done announcing the rankings, Zhao Wuji immediately stood up and spoke, “Lord Judge, I have a request!”

“The banquet has already come to an end. Can it be that you’re unconvinced with your ranking? Even if you are, you have to suck it up,” said the chief judge coldly.

Zhao Wuji smiled in response, “I’m convinced by the ranking. But I had some harvest in the treasury and I would like to seek some guidance from Flower Burial. Let me experience the grace of the champion once more.”

He knew that the banquet had come to an end and there was nothing he could do about it. But if he could humiliate Lin Yun, the champion of the banquet would instantly become a laughingstock. At that time, Lin Yun would be humiliated by his ranking.

The moment Zhao Wuji finished speaking, a huge uproar swept through the crowd. Although they guessed that Zhao Wuji was unhappy, they didn’t think he would go this far.

The chief judge’s eyes flashed coldly and said, “You dare to act with such impudence in front of the Sacred Alliance?”

The chief judge’s rage was intimidating, which made many people nervous.

“How almighty.” Yu Haotian’s voice sounded out right at this moment and smiled playfully, “This is just a friendly spar between the younger generation. It has nothing to do with our sects, so who are you to interfere? I, Yu Haotian, want to seek guidance from Lin Yun! Lin Yun, are you man enough?”

Yu Haotian’s words were like a bomb that made the crowd nervous. Evidently, Zhao Wuji and Yu Haotian wanted to embarrass Lin Yun in front of everyone. Especially since Yu Haotian was going as far as questioning Lin Yun’s manhood.

The crowd became nervous when they saw Lin Yun. After all, Zhao Wuji and Yu Haotian had gotten a lot stronger in the treasury. If they weren’t confident, they wouldn’t act so arrogant.

Surprisingly, Lin Yun didn’t even hesitate to step forward. Everyone was surprised because they assumed Lin Yun didn’t have a harvest from the treasury.

When Yu Haotian and Zhao Wuji saw Lin Yun step forward, they were stunned. However, they were also pleased on the inside and they started to sneer.

“You really stepped forward.” Yu Haotian wore a smile because Lin Yun was really foolish to be so easily provoked.

“Since the two of you are courting humiliation, how can I possibly disappoint you?” asked Lin Yun indifferently.

“Interesting. You’re really full of yourself. Since we dared to ask for a spar, we naturally have the means to deal with your spiritual sword intent. You’re nothing without your spiritual sword intent.” Zhao Wuji sneered because he had been waiting for this opportunity for a long time.

“No need to make this troublesome. The two of you can come at me together. If I can’t defeat the two of you within three moves, I’ll surrender my status as champion,” said Lin Yun coldly with rage flashing in his eyes.

Zhao Wuji had been annoying him ever since they were in the treasury, so his patience had reached its limit. As for Yu Haotian, Lin Yun already tried to kill him before. Since the fool wanted to act fearless, Lin Yun would make him pay.

Did these clowns think I don’t have a temper? Even the kindest man would be furious if they were pushed too far.
