Chapter 391 - It Has Been A Long Time

The incoming breeze blew on Lord Thirteen’s white beard and revealed his face covered with wrinkles. Looking at the youth before him, Lord Thirteen was filled with emotions. Lately, he was worried about Lin Yun because of Xin Jue’s death. He saw Lin Yun bitterly cry out in pain in front of Xin Jue’s corpse numerous times.

In the past, this youth never shedded a tear even when he was forced into the Sword Burial Woods. But Lin Yun cried numerous times over the past ten days. Lord Thirteen was genuinely fond of Lin Yun, so he was afraid that Lin Yun wouldn’t be able to walk out of this shadow.

But Lin Yun ultimately made it through. He did not sink into sorrow and hatred. He was still the youth he was back then. There was vicissitude in his eyes that couldn’t be hidden.

“Brat, do whatever you must. As long as I can still draw my sword, I will help you,” said Lord Thirteen.

“Lord Thirteen, can the needles still be used?” Lin Yun lowered his gaze onto the needles on the ground. The needles were fine, so no one could expect that they were a poisonous weapon.

“You can. The poison won’t act up as long as it doesn’t come in contact with blood.” Lord Thirteen had guessed what Lin Yun wanted to do. He didn’t say anything and handed the needles over to Lin Yun.

When Lin Yun received the needles, a cold killing aura flashed in his eyes. He kept the needles and took a deep glance at Xin Jue. To anyone who didn’t know that he was already dead, Xin Jue would look like he was in a deep slumber. Lin Yun turned around and left. “Goodbye.”

Senior Brother, I will surely participate in the Dragon Gate Competition and I will use my sword to protect Big Sister Xin Yan…

It was already deep into autumn and the streets were still bustling with people. Holding onto the Dragon Blooded Horse’s strap, Lin Yun didn’t attract any attention as he walked. The commotion of him charging through the gate ten days ago had already settled down.

Lin Yun walked on the bustling street and stopped before the Myriad Treasure Pavilion. When the guards noticed Lin Yun’s extraordinary temperament, they immediately came up to receive the horse from Lin Yun.

“May I ask you your name? Please let me know if you need anything. The Myriad Treasure Pavilion will definitely try our best to satisfy your request,” said one of the guards.

“Lin Yun,” he replied.

The attendant examined Lin Yun and he was briefly stunned before his eyes lit up. He asked with an emotional voice, “Are you the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s Lin Yun?”

Lin Yun had already caused a commotion in the Myriad Treasure Pavilion in the past, not to mention that his achievements in the Princess Manor spread his fame even further.

“I am. Bring me to your Hall Master,” said Lin Yun.

“Yes, I’ll make a report of your arrival immediately.” The attendant settled down the Dragon Blooded Horse before he went to look for Wei Yue, the Myriad Treasure Pavilion’s Hall Master. It didn’t take long for Wei Yue to arrive in the room that Lin Yun was waiting in.

“What a rare guest we have today. What brings you here?” Wei Yue asked in a polite voice as he had a deep impression of Lin Yun.

“I need your help to find someone,” said Lin Yun.

“May I know who it is?” asked Wei Yue.

“The Wang Clan’s direct descendant, Wang Yan,” answered Lin Yun.

“This…” Wei Yue wore a difficult expression before he smiled, “Young Master Lin, I’m a businessman, and I don’t have the ability to help you find someone. I can recommend you some people if you want to look for someone. After all, the professionals are better at handling something like this.”

Lin Yun didn’t utter a word when he saw Wei Yue’s expression. He walked towards the window. Looking at the bustling streets, Lin Yun spoke out, “Intelligence is something a businessman should grasp. Hall Master Wei, you can be honest if you’re afraid of trouble. I won’t force you.”

For some reason, Wei Yue felt a chill run down his spine. He quickly spoke out, “Since Young Master Lin is putting it this way, then I won’t beat around the bush with you. I can help you locate Wang Yan, but I also heard that you’ve created a legend by ascending the tenth level in the Black Lotus Palace. I wonder if you can leave a treasure or two behind for the Myriad Treasure Pavilion to auction?”

“Hall Master Wei, your intelligence is pretty updated,” said Lin Yun with a mocking gaze.

“This still hasn’t spread out, but it won’t take long for the entire empire to know about it. All the chambers of commerce naturally paid attention to something like the Demonlotus Realm. After all, we can’t allow us to be one step slower when getting treasures, right?” Wei Yue smiled embarrassedly.

“I have already handed everything I don’t need to the sect. If you fancy this spear, you can take it.” Lin Yun recalled that he had a spear in his interspatial pouch. It was basically scraped, which was why he didn’t hand it to the sect.

Hall Master Wei received the spear. He rejoiced before he noticed that this was a nearly destroyed spear. He quickly smiled, “It might be half-scraped, but it’s still an ancient cosmic artifact. It might be able to sell for a good price relying on the Demonlotus Realm’s reputation.”

Taking the spear, Hall Master Wei looked at Lin Yun and said, “Please wait here for me. I’ll get Wang Yan’s location for you shortly.”

Shortly after, Wei Yue returned with an awkward expression. He said, “Young Master Lin, Wang Yan is in the Sword Firmament Pavilion. He’s at the Gentlemen Union.”

“He’s not in the Wang Clan’s Manor?” Lin Yun was surprised. He was expecting Wang Yan to hide in the Wang Clan’s headquarters. He was surprised that Wang Yan was actually in the Sword Firmament Pavilion.

“The Wang Clan’s Manor? How can anywhere be safer than the Sword Firmament Pavilion? Does anyone dare to charge into the Sword Firmament Pavilion to kill someone?” laughed Wei Yue.

Indeed, the Sword Firmament Pavilion was safer than anywhere else for Wang Yan if Wei Yue put it that way. It looks like Wang Yan was confident that no one would do anything to him. He was related to the Wang Clan, not to mention that no one had any evidence against him. So not even the sect could do anything about it. Furthermore, he also had another layer of protection through the crown prince.

It’s against the rule in the sect to kill someone. So Wang Yan must be in a pretty good mood, right? Lin Yun sneered inwardly when he thought about this.

“Right, something big happened to the Sword Firmament Pavilion recently. I’m afraid that you still don't know about it,” said Wei Yue when he suddenly thought of something.

“What is it?” Lin Yun was wondering if Xin Jue’s death had already been spread out.

“Bai Lixuan came out of seclusion one month ago. His appearance was accompanied by a natural phenomenon that dyed the sky in rainbow colors for three days. According to the rumors, it appears that he has achieved the Saintly Physique. He’s probably the strongest in the Great Qin Empire in terms of aptitude,” said Wei Yue filled with emotions in his tone. He was also shocked when he witnessed the phenomenon.

There were two things that determined a cultivator’s talent. One was their aptitude and the other was their comprehension. Comprehension couldn’t be measured, but aptitude could. Lin Yun was considered one of the top figures in the Great Qin Empire with his Eighth Grade Spiritual Physique.

The Saint Physique was an unprecedented aptitude. This generally meant that Bai Lixuan wouldn’t be ordinary in the future. Even in the entire Ancient Southern Domain, there weren’t many people who could achieve the Saint Physique.

“He’s finally out. What a coincidence.” Lin Yun had long heard that Bai Lixuan would shock the entire empire the moment he came out. It looks like the rumors weren't false. A natural phenomenon that enveloped the entire Great Qin Empire and lasted for three days…

“Farewell.” Lin Yun didn’t stay long in the Myriad Treasure Pavilion.

“What’s wrong with Lin Yun? Does he look different now or is it just me?” Wei Yue held onto his chin. Lin Yun in the past had an extraordinary temperament. But the Lin Yun of today just felt unfathomable. He didn’t seem concerned that Bai Lixuan came out of seclusion.

Didn’t he know that two tigers couldn’t stay in the same mountain? A battle between him and Bai Lixuan was unavoidable whether he wanted it or not. And he would be trampled on by others if he wasn’t careful enough.

Seven days later in the Gentlemen Union stood Wang Yan who was in a pretty good mood. Lin Yun’s guess was correct. He was standing on the stage facing the Eight Vajras with hundreds of disciples watching. He made a breakthrough in his cultivation without him knowing, reaching the ninth stage of the Profound Martial Realm.

He was holding onto his sword facing the Eight Vajras. He even held a slight advantage over them in the fight.

“Lose!” Wang Yan barked at them and hacked his sword down, which sent the Eight Vajras flying. When they landed on the ground, they came up to congratulate Wang Yan.

Wang Yan’s aura was surging and he felt great. The pellet that was given to him by the crown prince was truly great. It allowed him to break through his bottleneck instantly.

“Senior Brother, it won’t take long before you reach the Heaven Ranking with your strength.”

“Your name will be on the Heaven Ranking sooner or later.”

“I’m afraid that no one is your opponent aside from disciples of the Heaven Ranking.”

Wang Yan wore a smile when the Eight Vajras flattered him. He was initially feeling uneasy when he came out of the Extermination Mountain Range. He didn’t expect that he actually killed Xin Jue by pure coincidence.

When the crown prince came to congratulate Bai Lixuan for attaining the Saint Physique, it made him feel relieved. If he was given another chance, he would still try to kill Lin Yun with no regrets. The sword slave made him feel humiliated several times, especially when the sword slave killed his younger brother, Wang Ning. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Thinking of Lin Yun, the smile on Wang Yan’s face disappeared and asked, “Is the sword slave still not back?”

“Not yet. The group from the Demonlotus Realm returned a long time ago, but Lin Yun wasn’t with them…”

“I heard that Bai Lixuan even made a trip to the Locket Mountain to look for him.”

“Haha, I never expected that Bai Lixuan actually had a grudge with Lin Yun. Someone can finally deal with that sword slave now.”

“Bai Lixuan is really a monster. His cultivation soared the moment he came out of his seclusion. I heard that he had defeated six of the Heaven Ranking’s disciples in less than ten moves.”

“There’s no way we can understand how powerful the Saint Physique is.”

Wang Yan grinned, “I’m looking forward to his return to the Sword Firmament Pavilion. I wonder what his face will look like when he sees that Bai Lixuan achieved the Saint Physique.”

“It has been a long time since we last met, yet you’re still just as concerned about me as before.” A voice suddenly rang out that broke Wang Yan’s mood.

When everyone turned their attention to the source, they saw a youth walking over carrying a sword box behind him. The youth raised his brow and appeared on the stage in the next second.

“Lin Yun!” exclaimed Wang Yan as his face changed.
