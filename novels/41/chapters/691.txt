Chapter 692 - Killing an Inner Ranking’s Genius

Lin Yun’s words were like a slap to Xiang Tianhe’s face, especially when Lin Yun said that the latter was merely a genius ranked at the bottom of the inner ranking. In Skymound City, everyone gave him a face and called him a genius on the inner ranking. But in fact, he had long been surpassed by the seven Skymound City’s geniuses. Facing Chu Muyan and Chen Ziyu, he could only follow behind them.

He might have his honor, but it was nothing compared to those two. So Lin Yun’s words were like a sharp blade stabbing into his heart.

“What arrogance! I’ll let you know today that even someone at the bottom of the inner ranking can kill you easily! You cannot imagine the gulf between us!” Xiang Tianhe stabbed his spear at Lin Yun’s chest.

Facing Xiang Tianhe’s spear, Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with disdain. Did Xiang Tianhe really think that he cultivated so long for nothing? The Azure Dragon Mark on his chest bloomed as nine dragons intertwined together to form a purple shield.

When Xiang Tianhe’s spear collided with the shield, it released a dazzling light, but Lin Yun didn’t even take a step back. Sneering with disdain in his eyes, Lin Yun asked, “Is that all you have?”

Xiang Tianhe was too weak compared to him. Half a month ago, he still needed to use his sword to fight. But now, he didn’t even have to draw his sword.

“Shattering Mountains and Rivers!” Xiang Tianhe roared furiously when he heard Lin Yun’s mockery. His aura began to blaze like a sun, which condensed into a blazing aura that shrouded the spear.

“This again?” Lin Yun’s killing aura surged as a dragon roar echoed out from within his body. When he clenched his fist, the three dragon runes gathered and strengthened his fist. When he threw his punch out, he stopped Xiang Tianhe’s attack right on the spot.

“Inspiring Mountains and Rivers!” Xiang Tianhe brandished his spear as a blazing aura poured into his body. At this moment, he was fused with the mountains and rivers. When he swept his spear down, the entire region had started to tremble.

“What power!” Everyone was shocked by Xiang Tianhe’s attack as they quickly retreated.

This time, the dragon runes gathered onto Lin Yun’s fist shattered as he was pushed back.

“Lin Yun is done for!” Everyone rejoiced when they saw this scene. But in reality, Lin Yun didn’t even suffer the slightest injury as he began to accumulate his energy. When he landed on the ground, he threw his punch out.

“Break!” Lin Yun roared as he gathered five dragon runes this time around and threw his punch. Facing Lin Yun’s punch, Xiang Tianhe threw out a mouthful of blood before he was sent flying. When he smashed into a hill, the impact from Lin Yun’s punch soon covered the hill with cracks.

“Hmph.” Lin Yun’s body jolted as he was like an ancient azure dragon at this moment, controlling the wind and lightning energies. He looked invincible.

Stomping his foot on the ground, Lin Yun charged forward like a bolt of lightning towards Xiang Tianhe. The latter had targeted him time and time again all for a woman. This had truly awakened Lin Yun’s killing intent. Since Xiang Tianhe wanted to kill him, he naturally wouldn’t give Xiang Tianhe the chance to catch his breath.

“Devouring Mountains and Rivers!” Xiang Tianhe’s face changed as he soared into the sky and clashed with Lin Yun. The spear in his hand was like a sinister python that wanted to devour the mountains and rivers. His face was distorted since he had given his all in this attack.

“You’re just a mantis before a cart. You’re courting death!” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly as the nine dragon runes on his body began to move. The nine dragon runes emitted a dazzling light along with a torrential pressure. This made Xiang Tianhe’s attack look pitiful. Lin Yun merely waved his hand and slapped the python to destroy it.

“H-h-how is this possible?!” Everyone exclaimed when they saw this scene as Lin Yun looked like a wargod enveloped in lightning. Even Xiang Tianhe was shocked by Lin Yun’s strength.

“There’s a huge gulf between us? Who gave you the face to say that?” Lin Yun stood in the sky as a dragon roar echoed from within his body before he gave another slap. This time, the slap landed on Xiang Tianhe’s cheek, which made him spit blood and go flying. This time, the entire hill collapsed as Xiang Tianhe landed in the ruins.

“You’re courting death!” Xiang Tianhe roared furiously. He couldn’t describe his anger with words right now because he was actually slapped around in public by a sword slave. As roared, he released a terrifying aura from his body, which formed a gigantic wolf behind him.

“Martial Soul!”

“Xiang Tianhe is actually forced to use his Martial Soul! Holy shit!” Everyone’s faces changed as they never expected that the situation would be so dangerous to the point that Xiang Tianhe was forced to summon his martial soul. The moment the seventh profound grade martial soul appeared, Xiang Tianhe’s aura soared.

With a cold light flickering in his pupils, Xiang Tianhe vanished as he charged towards Lin Yun with the gigantic wolf. Facing the gigantic wolf, even Lin Yun could feel the pressure as he quickly dodged with the Seven Profound Steps.

Xiang Tianhe’s spear and the wolf’s paw had stretched out at the same time, creating a gigantic crater on where Lin Yun stood preciously. But Xiang Tianhe didn’t stop there as he continued to attack.

The gigantic wolf had boosted Xiang Tianhe’s strength, killing aura, and speed. If Xiang Tianhe used it against someone else, he might be able to intimidate his opponent. But it was a pity that he ran into Lin Yun, who was only starting to warm up. After a few more probing attacks, Lin Yun finally knew Xiang Tianhe’s strength after he summoned his martial soul.

“You can be proud that you’re able to force me to summon my martial soul,” said Xiang Tianhe with his face distorted. He couldn’t accept the fact that he was forced to summon his martial soul by someone in the greater Yang stage. After this battle, he would be a laughingstock even if he won. So his pupils were flashing with deep hatred.

“You still have no idea of your current situation, even when facing death,” said Lin Yun coldly. “You were nothing in my eyes half a month ago, not to mention now. I only need one move to defeat you!”

Along with a brilliant sword ray, Lin Yun’s xiantian sword intent soared into the sky before pouring into the nine dragon runes on his body. In that split second, Lin Yun had completely merged his dragon aura and sword aura together.

Lin Yun was radiating with light as he stood in the sky. The sky slowly turned silver, causing the spectators to open their mouths in disbelief. At this moment, Lin Yun seemed like the ruler of the entire sky with everyone beneath his feet. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

In the next second, the gigantic wolf behind Xiang Tianhe broke into pieces as Xiang Tianhe was sent flying. He couldn’t even follow the trajectory of Lin Yun’s punch when he was sent flying away.

When he landed on the ground, he struggled to get on his feet only to be stomped on by Lin Yun’s foot. Yelling out in pain as he looked at the youth basked in light, Xiang Tianhe had fear on his face as he begged, “Lin Yun, please give me a chance.”

“Give you a chance?” Lin Yun’s face was cold as he said, “You became a dog willingly rather than giving me a chance. So there’s no way you can change my mind from killing you!”

When Lin Yun’s foot stomped one last time, Xiang Tianhe’s body exploded into pieces.
