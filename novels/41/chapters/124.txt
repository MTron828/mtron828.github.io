Chapter 125 - Sword Firmament Pavilion

“What is Lin Yun trying to do by provoking Mei Zihua and Xue Tu at the same time!”

“Isn’t he a little too arrogant?”

“Not necessary. He was, after all, forced to take this step because Mei Zihua and Xue Tu were acting out one after another.”

“Hahaha! Look! Mei Zihua and Xue Tu’s faces had turned green!”

Discussions sounded out from the surrounding. No one had expected that Lin Yun would be so arrogant.

“You’re courting death!” Mei Zihua’s body trembled. No one had dared to belittle him in the Azure Sun County. Out of rage, he slapped on his interspatial pouch and took out a two meter black halberd.

Boom!

Mei Zihua slammed his halberd on the ground, which caused the earth to tremble. Shortly after, a heavy aura emitted out from the halberd, making it hard for everyone to breathe.

Simultaneously, black flames ignited on the speartip, sending a chill down everyone’s spine.

“High-Grade Profound Artifact—Demonic Flame Halberd!”

“My heavens! The Golden Flame Sect actually gave Mei Zihua the Demonic Flame Halberd… This should be the only high-grade profound artifact in their sect!”

“It has been a long time since the Demonic Flame Halberd made its appearance.” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“The Golden Flame Sect has really put their hopes in Mei Zihua!”

The appearance of the Demonic Flame Halberd caused a commotion in the surrounding. While everyone was shocked, Xue Tu snorted and retrieved the Crimson Bone Whip.

Each segment was made with nine crimson demonic beast bones and whipping it would cause it to crack in the air. It was another high-grade profound artifact!

The Blood Cloud Sect and Golden Flame Sect had given them the sect’s high-grade profound artifacts to ensure that the two could get something from the Azure Sun Realm.

However, Lin Yun was surprisingly calm. His body emitted a crimson radiance that seemed like flawless sculptured jade. It was accompanied by the Fiery Demon’s Might that soared into the sky. Standing in the crimson radiance, Lin Yun’s hair fluttered.

Boom!

Lin Yun kicked on the sword box with his right foot, sending it into the air and opening up.

Clang!

A sword flew out from the sword box, whose aura wasn’t any weaker than the Crimson Bone Whip and Demonic Flame Halberd.

“Come, it won’t be a bad thing to get rid of you two before the Azure Sun Realm opens!” Lin Yun smiled, releasing his boundless fighting intent.

He cultivated for months, experiencing life-and-death scenarios in the process. If he didn’t even dare to face Mei Zihua and Xue Tu, he might as well give up on the Martial Dao!

The atmosphere was intense. No one had expected that Lin Yun still dared to face Mei Zihua and Xue Tu after the two of them brought out their high-grade profound artifacts.

“Since you’re courting death, I won’t mind taking your life before the Azure Sun Realm opens!” snorted Xue Tu. His torrential killing intent soared into the sky.

Clatter! Clatter! Clatter!

“Excuse me! Excuse me!” A group of people came riding their horses.

The young man leading the party smiled, “Hoh? What are the two of you doing here? The two of you want to gang up on someone? Is it glorious?”

“The Radiant Pavilion!”

The surrounding cultivators sucked in a cold breath. They never imagined that the Radiant Pavilion would come at such a crucial moment. The leader of this group was the Radiant Pavilion’s Young Sect Master, Ming Ye!

Lin Yun was stunned when he saw Ming Ye. He had no idea what this fellow was trying to do.

Looking at Ming Ye, Mei Zihua and Xue Tu’s faces changed at the same time, “Ming Ye, what are you trying to do?”

Leaping down from his horse, Ming Ye crossed his arms together and smiled, “Me? Nothing. I just want to see how shameless the two of you can be. I managed to learn a thing or two about you just now. Who knows if it might be useful in the Azure Sun Realm. Hey, what’s the matter? Why aren’t you two continuing? Tsk, tsk! The two of you even brought out your high-grade profound artifacts, what an eye-opening experience!”

The sudden appearance of Ming Ye and his party left Mei Zihua and Xue Tu feeling irritated. When they heard his words, their gazes flickered. Even their hatred for Lin Yun had declined.

If they could, they wanted to slaughter Ming Ye right at this moment. That fellow was too insulting and each of his words jabbed at their soft spot.

He was practically calling the two of them out for being shameless!

“I don’t need help to kill a piece of trash.” Mei Zihua’s face turned cold and he put away the Demonic Flame Halberd before leaving.

On the other hand, Xue Tu’s eyes flickered. He did not want to give up on this opportunity with Lin Yun. The grudge between the Blood Cloud Sect and Lin Yun was incomparable to Lin Yun’s personal grudge with Mei Zihua. It had risen to the level that it concerned their Blood Cloud Sect’s reputation.

When Xue Tu turned around, he saw a few Blood Cloud Sect elders shaking their heads at him. The opening of the Azure Sun Sect was imminent, and it wasn’t appropriate for them to clash with the Radiant Pavilion.

“Watch out, Ming Ye! I’ll see how long you can protect him for!” Xue Tu left behind his words before returning to the Blood Cloud Sect’s disciples.

Ming Ye clearly wanted to protect Lin Yun. So if Xue Tu insisted on pursuing this matter, it would spark a war between the two sects. It would definitely result in heavy casualties, so he had no choice but to back down.

Clang!

Lin Yun sheathed his sword and withdrew the Fiery Demon Battle Physique. He asked, “Sir Ming, why are you helping me?”

“Even without my help, you still won’t be in danger with your Perfect Fiery Demon Battle Physique, right?” chuckled Ming Ye. He did not answer Lin Yun’s question.

What Ming Ye said was the truth. With so many people in the surrounding, he was still confident that he could cause chaos and leave.

“So what’s wrong with a small friendly gesture? On the other hand, I’ll have to ask for Brother Lin’s help if required, in the Azure Sun Realm,” smiled Ming Ye.

Since Ming Ye was so straightforward, it would seem rude for Lin Yun to refuse. Lin Yun smiled inwardly and he cupped his hands together, “You’re exaggerating. We’ll just have each other’s back.”

In the end, Ming Ye only helped him because of his potential. Since that was the case, it wouldn’t harm Lin Yun to go along with it. At the very least, they had no conflict of interest for the time being.

With that, the earth-shattering battle that everyone was anticipating came to an end because of Ming Ye. This left many people disappointed. Some people were even hoping that they would’ve exhausted themselves so that the competitors for the Azure Sun Realm would’ve been reduced.

“Those two fellows brought high-grade profound artifacts with them. Did they think that they would bring out cosmic artifacts?” Ming Ye’s smile disappeared after Mei Zihua and Xue Tu went far away.

“Cosmic artifacts?” Lin Yun was baffled.

“A cosmic artifact is an artifact with a higher grade than the profound artifact. None of the three overlord forces in the Azure Sun County has a cosmic artifact. If you only bring out a tenth of the cosmic artifact’s powers, even cultivators in the seventh orifice of the Xiantian Realm would have to retreat… But no one has managed to bring out a cosmic artifact from the Azure Sun Realm,” smiled Ming Ye.

The old man standing beside Ming Ye shook his head and sighed, “It’s difficult to bring out cosmic artifacts as Xiantian Realm cultivators.”

Lin Yun fell into deep thought when he heard the two of them talking. He knew that cosmic artifacts existed in the Azure Sun Realm, they just weren’t easy to bring out.

Looking into the distance, the two statues still stood with their boundless aura rippling out.

Many people were like Lin Yun and were filled with expectations. This pressure would remain until the Azure Sun Realm opened. Looking at the phenomenon in the sky, anyone could guess that the secret realm would open up soon.

However, they had no idea about the exact time.

Rustle!

Just when everyone wondered when the secret realm would open, a shocking sword aura came from the north. Even from a few myriad meters away, everyone present could still sense it.

“What powerful sword aura!” As a swordsman, Lin Yun’s face changed and he raised his head to the north.

Ten thousand meters high in the sky, the clouds were separated into two by a sword aura, which slowly spread out. Beneath the clouds, ten-odd Sword Condors were flying over, carrying a group of people on their backs.

The terrifying sword aura came from those people.

“The Sword Firmament Pavilion is here!” Ming Ye spoke with a grave expression.

The Sword Firmament Pavilion was one of the four great forces in the Great Qin Empire and caused Lin Yun to become emotional.
