Chapter 1025 - Overbearing

There was only one path to the Four Phase City, which took half a day to traverse. It was one of the safest places outside of Four Phase City. There were many geniuses gathered who were making preparations for the final battle, trying to find an opportunity to get to the city, or exchanging inheritances.

Those who wanted to make a last ditch effort for the Heavenly Path were quietly waiting. After all, Four Phase City was a place that they had to go to no matter what. Unfortunately, the road was completely locked by an altar of a hundred feet. Behind the altar was a massive statue that emitted a boundless aura. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

This was the way the war realms sealed off the Yellow Sandy Plains. Without permission, no one could get past the barrier. At this moment, there were many people gathered in front of the altar because they were fed up with the war realms.

The spiritual energy in the Yellow Sandy Plain was thin. Plus, the environment was so harsh that it would threaten a careless person. Time was precious in the Heavenly Path, so no one wanted to be trapped in the Yellow Sand Plain. Everyone wanted to proceed, but the ones on the altar looked at them with disdain.

The geniuses of the three war realms were on top of the altar and emitting a terrifying aura.

“How long are you going to trap us for!?”

“Let us pass!” Someone roared furiously as their patience was gone.

“What impudence! Who are you to yell at us!?” A genius from the Nether Divinity War Realm said coldly.

“This isn’t fair! Who are you guys to stop us from passing!”

“You guys are just a bunch of ants and no one will pay any attention to you guys. So what if any of you make it to Four Phase City? Do you think that you’re qualified to join the final battle? Behave yourselves!” barked another genius from the Elysium Trigram War Realm.

“Damn it!” The war realms were too overbearing. So what if they were a bunch of ants? Did that mean that they didn’t have the qualification to enter the city?

“If you imbeciles don’t want to die, you better leave. Did you really think that this was your opportunity to rise? The Heavenly Path is just a stage for the Ten War Realms. You can have the opportunities we don’t care about.”

“You’re all just a bunch of dogs. You can only get our scraps if we feel like giving them to you. So get lost! No one is allowed to pass without the Realm Sons’ permission!”

The people on the altar were arrogant and unhappy that the higher realms were challenging them. In their eyes, everyone was from a lower realm.

Some distance away, Lin Yun and Pei Xue were watching from the shadows. Lin Yun’s gaze was cold because he already knew that the three war realms didn’t treat people from other realms as human beings. However, he didn’t expect the war realms to be this overbearing.

In the eyes of the war realms, everyone else was akin to livestock. So when Lin Yun saw this, he clenched his fists tightly. Although he knew something like this would happen, he was still angry.

His heart as a swordsman wanted freedom. But now, he felt as though he was being chewed by millions of ants. The rage on his face startled Pei Xue, but she had no idea how to comfort him.

“You guys are really taking it too far!” Finally, someone from the crowd started to flare up. The three war realms were after Lin Yun and Pei Xue, so why did they have to wait around? Even worse, the war realms wanted to humiliate everyone, including those that were unrelated.

“So what if we’re taking it too far? Who are you to say otherwise? We don’t have time to waste time with you,” said a golden-clothed youth who emitted traces of dragon aura. He was a genius from the Profound Dragon War Realm. The Profound Dragon War Realm was rumored to possess a pure-blood Ancient Dragon that originated from the Black Dragon bloodline.

A man from the Elysium Trigram War Realm spoke, “I advise you all to leave immediately. We don’t want to waste our time killing you dogs, but that doesn't mean that we won’t!”

The moment he finished speaking, the geniuses around him began to laugh. The laughter instantly lit a fire among the various realms as they roared, “Who are you calling dogs, you monkey!”

Immediately, the Elysium Trigram War Realm genius stopped smiling. “I told you not to take it too far. Dogs like you should be obedient. Don’t force us to start a massacre!”

“Damn it!” yelled one of the bystanders.

“We can be killed, but not humiliated! Let’s fight them! I don’t believe that they can stop all of us!” Several violent-tempered youths decided to make a move. They were considered geniuses of their realms and even of the Heavenly Path. “Charge! Even if we die, we’ll drag some of them down with us!”

Without hesitation, the small group charged towards the altar. The war realm geniuses were full of disdain, but they had no intention of moving. “These ants…”

The Elysium Trigram War Realm’s genius stood up with a fiery whip in his hand. The moment the whip appeared, the surrounding space began to distort. Clearly, his dao artifact had an extraordinary origin since it had traces of divine rune aura.

“Ancient dao artifact!” The crowd instantly recognized the whip as an ancient dao artifact with a divine rune from ancient times. It was so shocking that the crowd felt their hearts throb.

The outcome was just as they had imagined, the attacks were easily resolved. The Elysium Trigram War Realm’s genius wore a brutal smile as he whipped his attackers. He broke their bones and whipped their faces, forcing them to submit. “Kneel!”

Right at this moment, a figure soared into the sky to save those people. He was a genius from a higher realm with cultivation in the fourth soul Heavenly Soul Realm. Executing a monarch fortune martial technique, he tried to shatter the space restricted by the Elysium Trigram War Realm’s genius.

“How stubborn!” The youth from the Profound Dragon War Realm spoke and made his move. He took out a ruler with an ancient dracophant engraved on it. In the next second, a dragon roared as a relentless dragon aura intimidated the crowd.

“The Black Dragon Ruler!” Someone instantly recognized the ruler. It was a supreme treasure of the Profound Dragon War Realm. However, this one was a replica. Even though it was a replica, it was still very powerful, especially since the dracophant engraved on it looked like a vivid dragon.

When he swung the ruler out, he shattered the bones of the youth who opposed the war realms. The surrounding atmosphere became cold as the crowd examined the youth covered in blood.

“Imbeciles, the two lords are being lenient. Why are any of you still standing here?! Get lost before you die!” The geniuses of the higher realms who had submitted to the three War Realms were speaking up.

It made the crowd feel oppressed by the strength of the war realms. The foundation of the war realms was too strong and their treasures were too powerful.

“You, get lost!” A higher realm’s genius looked at a hooded azure-clothed figure and barked.

“Where did this dog come from?” replied the azure-clothed figure.

“You bastard! You dare insult me? Are you tired of living?!” The genius of the higher realm couldn’t stand the humiliation.

“How noisy.” When the azure-clothed figure was done speaking, he removed his hood and threw it at the lackey of the war realms. Instantly, the higher realm genius was struck before he could respond.

“No!” Everything happened so quickly that the war realm geniuses didn’t have any time to react. Just like that, they witnessed their lackeys get killed one by one.

“You dare our dogs?! Are you tired of living?!” The geniuses of the Profound Dragon and Elysium Trigram War Realms charged towards the azure-clothed figure. However, once they saw who it was, they stopped moving.

Everyone flew into an uproar at the appearance of Lin Yun.
