Chapter 2359 - Shameless

Wasn’t that the name of the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity? Compared to the composure of the white-clothed youth, Lin Yun was shocked as he looked at the other party. He had long heard of this name and his legend. It was so much so that Lin Yun even felt a connection between them. But he never thought that this person would stand before him one day.

“What’s the matter? You don’t believe me?” The white-clothed youth smiled.

Lin Yun came to his senses, and smiled, “It’s not that I don’t believe you, but this name is too shocking. You’re the White-Clothed Bladesman, but you’re also the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity.”

“Sit down,” Xiao Chen smiled. With a wave of his hand, a towering tree appeared with a table beneath and two chairs. After sitting down, he signalled for Lin Yun to sit down and filled up the cup.

Lin Yun curiously looked around. Isn’t this place my sea of consciousness? But why does it look like the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity’s home instead?

He carefully sat down, raising the cup. He was filled with questions, but he didn’t dare to ask them.

Xiao Chen noticed this, and smiled, “You can ask what you want. There’s no need for us to be so restricted.”

Lin Yun briefly pondered, then asked, “Are you a lingering thought or a clone?”

Those two were different concepts. If it was a lingering thought, the other party would only remember everything up to before leaving behind the thought and nothing else. But it was different if it was the clone because it was the same as the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity being here.

Xiao Chen lowered his cup and smiled, “I was only a thought, but my actual thought possessed this thought after sensing your aura. So you can treat this as a clone.”

“You’re here specially for me?” Lin Yun looked at the other party.

Xiao Chen smiled, “Of course. It’s inconvenient for me to meet you when you’re in the Kunlun Realm. But this was an opportunity to meet, so it would be a pity to miss it.” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

After briefly pausing, Xiao Chen said with a hint of sorrow, “I’ve... missed you.”

Lin Yun thought about many things at this moment, and his face changed thinking about the ‘broken sword’ in his body. He asked in a trembling tone, “The sword in my body is related to you?”

Xiao Chen said nothing but merely nodded. This made Lin Yun squint, suffering a huge impact.

“You want to know the reason? Let me tell you about it.” Xiao Chen gulped down a cup of wine and looked at Lin Yun.

Lin Yun could feel his heart pumping because this day was finally coming. That was his most prominent secret that not even Su Ziyao knew about. So far, only Lil’ Purple knew about it.

Seeing the change in Lin Yun’s face, Xiao Chen had a hint of doubt. But he soon realized what Lin Yun was worrying about, and sighed, “It looks like you’re not prepared for it.”

Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts. His arrival in this world was truly related to the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity. Wouldn’t that mean he was a chess piece of the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity? He suddenly felt that everything that he had experienced had become pointless. With a bitter smile, he drank the wine and looked at the white-clothed youth, “So... it’s not a coincidence?”

“I know what you’re worried about. You should’ve heard of something that fate cannot be controlled or resisted?” Xiao Chen said, shaking his head. “I’m related to your arrival in Kunlun Realm, but I can’t control your fate... Everything is your choice.”

Lin Yun’s expression loosened up after hearing that.

Xiao Chen smiled, “So... can I continue?”

Lin Yun nodded since his instincts told him he could trust this person.

Xiao Chen looked at the sky and said, “I once had a good friend. We were rivals and friends. Everyone said that I established the Divine Dragon Era, but no one knew that the Divine Dragon Era couldn’t be established if he was without his sword. Before his death, he said that he was willing to be friends with me if there was an afterlife, and his sword would wait for my blade.”

Lin Yun was stumped upon hearing that. He asked, “So... I’m that friend of yours?”

“Yes and no,” Xiao Chen smiled. “Life cannot be revived, and that’s a fate that no one can resist. I can’t do anything about it. I can only find ways to let him live again. But the birth of an era was too dangerous, and I have been fighting since the establishment of the Divine Dragon Era without stopping, facing countless troubles. There were primordial fiendgods, primordial beasts, and various enemies. The battle never stopped, even after the Heavenly Path was forged...”

“I know, but you won all of them,” Lin Yun said.

“That’s right. The Kunlun Realm has been waiting, and I have never forgotten my promise,” Xiao Chen smiled. “I want to make him live again, but that’s not an easy task since I failed countless times. But I ultimately succeeded...”

Xiao Chen fell into deep thoughts, continuing his story with a smile, “I used a secret technique from Ancient Kunlun, which was an immortal art from Earth. I split his soul into two, one in Ancient Kunlun, while the other half remained in the Kunlun Realm.”

“Why split them apart?” Lin Yun asked.

Xiao Chen explained, “If it was left behind by an Immortal Lord in Ancient Kunlun, and it can only be executed in Ancient Kunlun. But if the entire soul belongs to Ancient Kunlun, you would eventually die since spirituality had declined in Ancient Kunlun. So I left half of his soul in the Kunlun Realm, waiting for the right opportunity for the sword in his body to merge the two souls.”

Lin Yun wasn’t shocked upon hearing that but felt relieved. This resolved a huge concern in his heart. He didn’t take over the Lin Yun in the Kunlun Realm, they were both him. This made Lin Yun feel less guilty.

But a new problem arose. Lin Yun asked, “So... am I still myself since I’m your friend? I don’t remember anything from my previous life.”

“You have a lot of concerns. I was the reincarnation of the Azure Firmament Immortal Lord, so did it affect me as the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity?” Xiao Chen laughed.

“I see...” Lin Yun raised his brow, and said, “I only live for the present and not the next lifetime.”

“What about the sword in your hand?” Xiao Chen asked with a smile.

“My sword will shatter the heaven!” Lin Yun said.

“Well said, cheers!” The Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity rejoiced as they bumped their cups. Xiao Chen laughed, “Hahaha! It looks like I made the right decision to be here.”

“Speaking of which, since we were friends in my past life, I won’t call you ancestral deity then. It’s not a problem for me to call you Big Brother Chen, right?” Lin Yun asked.

Xiao Chen was briefly stunned, before he smiled, “I don’t see any problem with that. Hahaha! But let me call you Big Brother Yun, instead.”

“Hahaha, that works as well,” Lin Yun smiled. “But Big Brother Chen, where are you now? I heard that you’re being suppressed in the Nether Realm?”

“You can say that,” Xiao Chen smiled. He then continued, “But you can also say that I’m suppressing the Divine Fate Palace in the Nether Realm.”

Lin Yun felt that the Blue Dragon King was pretty prideful. As they talked, they would talk about the current situation in the Kunlun Realm, Lin Yun’s experience, the Iris Sword Saint, and the Heavenly Path. The Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity was calm when he heard that the Heavenly Path was severed. This meant that Lin Yun could only rely on himself. If he couldn’t do it, he could leave it to the future generation. Aside from that, Xiao Chen also told Lin Yun about the eight primordial beasts and the sword, which made Lin Yun feel relieved.

“We have been winning, but I didn’t expect that the consequences of losing once would be so bad,” Xiao Chen sighed with a grave expression.

“You can’t be involved in a battle between deities?” Lin Yun asked. That’s what the Divine Phoenix Holy Master said, which Lin Yun wanted to verify again.

“Yeah. Those in the Ancestral Stage aren’t allowed to participate,” Xiao Chen nodded. He continued, “Although I have informed Iris to leave behind some opportunities for you, I didn’t expect your experience and even formed a karma with the Dragon’s Gate. Kamra is hard to sever, so you have to fulfil the promise you make to the Azure Dragon Lord no matter what.”

Lin Yun had no opinion about it because it was thanks to the Azure Dragon Lord that he could come this far. He asked, “About my master’s tribulation... Do you have any solution?”

“You already have an answer in your heart, right?” Xiao Chen smiled, looking at Lin Yun.

Lin Yun no longer asked his question when he heard that, since everything was within his expectations. The Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity couldn’t even return to the Kunlun Realm now, not to mention helping the Radiant Sword Saint with his tribulation.

“But I believe he will make it through the tribulation,” Xiao Chen smiled.

“Why?” Lin Yun asked.

“That’s because I can see light in your eyes, and you can do it, right?” Xiao Chen said, and he stood up. “It’s time for me to leave, this thought can’t last much longer.”

“Wait...” Lin Yun said.

“Mhm?” Xiao Chen was puzzled.

“We’re friends in the previous life, right?” Lin Yun smiled.

“That’s for sure. We’re best friends, Chu Chaoyun,” Xiao Chen replied.

Lin Yun smiled, “Since we’re friends, I won’t be polite with you then. Since you’re an expert in the Ancestral Stage, will you just leave like that?”

He naturally wouldn’t let the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity leave like that without any harvest, just like how Lil’ Red would clean up the battlefield each time, not to mention that the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity was an expert in the Ancestral Stage.

Xiao Chen was stumped. He briefly examined Lin Yun, then smiled, “If it’s Chu Chaoyun, he definitely wouldn’t say such words.”

“But you said that there are now two identical flowers in the world,” Lin Yun smiled.

Xiao Chen was briefly stunned, rhen smiled, “Alright. What do you want? I’m only a thought, so I can only give you martial techniques at best.”

“Big Brother, I don’t want that,” Lin Yun smiled.

“What do you want, then?” Xiao Chen asked. “I’m only a thought, so I can’t give you anything else.”

“What do you think of the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron? Why don’t you find a way and let me play with it?” Lin Yun smiled.

Hearing what Lin Yun said, Xiao Chen regretted that he had come.

“It’s not tough for you, right?” Lin Yun asked with a harmless smile.

“Don’t call me ‘big brother’. You’re my big brother instead,” Xiao Chen smiled bitterly.

“Thank you, Big Brother!” Lin Yun smiled, confirming the matter before Xiao Chen could decide.

“I gave it away, so there’s no way I can take it back... Why don’t you change it to something else?” Xiao Chen asked.

“Alright. I’ll listen to you, Big Brother,” Lin Yun smiled.

Seeing Lin Yun’s smile, Xiao Chen immediately realized that there was a trap waiting for him. He immediately changed his mind and handed Lin Yun a secret technique to control the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron. Since Lin Yun possessed the Blue Dragon Bone, it wouldn’t be hard for him to comprehend it. He said, “Let’s go with the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron, then.”

“Big Brother, you can feel free to visit anytime,” Lin Yun smiled.

This made Xiao Chen smile bitterly. He could only apologize to the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity.
