Chapter 2111 - Buddhist Emperor Relic

The Whiteclothed Venerable’s current state was terrible. He already had to pay the price for executing a secret technique and was now heavily injured by Lin Yun. Even if he wasn’t crippled, improving his cultivation for the next few years would be hard. It might even be a problem if he could step into the Saint Realm someday.

When the Whiteclothed Venerable returned to his human form, he laid on the ground twitching while being covered in blood, mourning in pain. But since he could mourn in pain, he was still alive.

Lin Yun merely glanced at the Whiteclothed Venerable, wanting to take the latter’s life.

“Stop!” This drastically changed the Orangeclothed Venerable’s face as his facial expression became sinister, dashing at Lin Yun.

Seeing this, Lin Yun could only fend off the Orangeclothed Venerable’s attack and retreat ten-odd meters away, cautiously watching the latter.

Zhao Tianyu took a step forth and came over to the Whiteclothed Venerable. He took a pill and stuffed it into the latter’s mouth before pouring his saint aura. It didn’t take long for the Whiteclothed Venerable to recover from some of his injuries, but he was still heavily injured.

Anyone could tell that Zhao Tianyu placed great importance on the Whiteclothed Venerable amongst the four venerables. When the Bloodclothed Venerable and Scarletclothed Venerable were injured, Zhao Tianyu didn’t move to help them.

When Lin Yun faced off with the Orangeclothed Venerable, Ji Haoyu, Bai Yunfeng, and the others came over. The six holy lands had an advantage, judging from the current situation. After all, Ye Qingtian had practically crippled all of Zhao Tianyu’s men, and he could still fight. If they joined hands, they could gang up on Zhao Tianyu.

Although they seemed to have a huge advantage, Bai Yunfeng and Ji Haoyu didn’t dare to move but nervously looked at Zhao Tianyu. Bai Yunfeng knew how terrifying Zhao Tianyu was. The previous time they met, Bai Yunfeng couldn’t do anything to Zhao Tianyu, even if he had ten Golden Guards. It was so much so that many from the Golden Guards were injured, proving that Zhao Tianyu’s strength was unfathomable. That’s why no one would dare to move as long as Zhao Tianyu was still around.

Zhao Tianyu stood up and gazed at the Eastern Desolation’s cultivators. This made the Eastern Desolation’s cultivators feel great pressure, but they didn’t take a step back despite having their palms covered in sweat.

In the end, Zhao Tianyu looked at Lin Yun. He said, “You’re the masked man from two months ago, right?”

“That’s right,” Lin Yun replied.

Zhao Tianyu showed a self-mocking smile and said, “How ridiculous. I actually wanted Ye Qingtian to deal with Ye Qingtian. You must have been laughing when I said that.”

Lin Yun frankly replied, “No, I didn’t. You have good eyesight. Only I can deal with Ye Qingtian.”

Zhao Tianyu probably didn’t know he was Ye Qingtian and Flower Burial. But it was a pity that he couldn’t reveal that. But his words confused everyone, and they could only guess that Ye Qingtian had fought them two months ago.

“It’s really you!” Zhao Tianyu smiled. His temperament was elegant without a hint of murderous intent, so those who didn’t know his identity might think that he’s treating him as an amiable person.

Bai Yunfeng reached out and dragged Lin Yun behind him and Ji Haoyu. Ye Qingtian already fought three battles in a row, and they were afraid that Zhao Tianyu might suddenly make a move against him.

“Zhao Tianyu, don’t tell me you still want to take the Golden Lotus Flametree away? The lives of the three venerables might not be in danger, but their future will be affected if they’re not treated in time,” Bai Yunfeng said, staring at Zhao Tianyu.

He was hinting that even if Zhao Tianyu could face them, the three venerables would have to die. So Zhao Tianyu would have to weigh it carefully if he still wanted the Golden Lotus Flametree.

“Young Master?” The Orangeclothed Venerable nervously looked at Zhao Tianyu. He knew how serious the three venerables’ injuries were. They were on the brink of death, especially the Scarletclothed Venerable. After all, Lin Yun’s sword nearly severed his neck, and he was barely alive.

The Bloodclothed Venerable was also in a terrible state. Only bones were left in her two arms. Her flesh and skin were removed by Ye Qingtian, and she had fainted from the pain.

The Whiteclothed Venerable’s injuries might look serious, but by relying on his cultivation and the Heavenly Aquatic Serpent’s bloodline, his injuries didn’t seem that serious. At the very least, he wouldn’t lose his life and cultivation.

Zhao Tianyu looked at the Sacred Fire Golden Lotus at the top of the Golden Lotus Flametree. That golden lotus was shining brightly, and the heart of the lotus was filled with a holy aura, looking like a legendary Buddhist relic.

“I want ten Sacred Fire Golden Lotuses,” Zhao Tianyu said.

“That’s impossible!” Ji Haoyu rejected. There were only twenty-odd Sacred Fire Golden Lotus, and Zhao Tianyu wanted so much in one go. At that time, there wouldn’t be enough for the six holy lands.

Zhao Tianyu smiled, “Since that’s the case, I’ll retrieve them myself.”

He stepped forth with lightning flickering within his pupils, acting as though he would execute the Divine Lightning Eyes the next moment. Those from the six holy lands felt great pressure, and their facial expressions became nervous.

Bai Yunfeng said with a grave expression, “Ten is impossible, but we can consider it if it’s only five.”

“Deal.” Zhao Tianyu smiled, and the lightning dissipated from his eyes. He returned to his amicable look.

“Qingyu, retrieve five Sacred Fire Golden Lotuses for him,” Bai Yunfeng said.

Bai Qingyu nodded and retrieved five Sacred Fire Golden Lotuses at the bottom. She returned and said, “Here you go.”

Zhao Tianyu smiled when he saw this because the five Sacred Fire Golden Lotuses were of the worst quality. So he didn’t reach out to receive them.

“You don’t want them? Sure, then. We’re already generous to give you five. But it’s fine if you don’t want them.” Bai Qingyu said. She had no fear in her eyes even when facing the infamous Blood Moon Divine Son.

“I want that. So retrieve it for me.” Zhao Tianyu pointed to the Sacred Fire Golden Lotus at the very top.

“Dream on. That is for Big Brother Ye,” Bai Qingyu glared at Zhao Tianyu.

“No one can refuse what the divine son wants!” The Orangeclothed Venerable was unhappy with Bai Qingyu’s attitude and became furious. He wanted to step forth and send her flying with a slap. But just when he wanted to make a move, he could sense a cold gaze directed at him. He instantly dared not move because he could feel his life being threatened.

“You want to bully a little girl? Come at me if you have the guts.” Lin Yun coldly looked at the Orangeclothed Venerable. He was arrogant and didn’t place these people in his eyes at all. He had fighting spirits blazing within his eyes. He was clearly standing behind Ji Haoyu and Bai Yunfeng, but he didn’t hold back his cockiness at all, and the sword intent he gave off was terrifying.

While the Orangeclothed Venerable was stared at by Lin Yun, the Orangeclothed Venerable didn’t dare to make a move.

“He’s right. There’s no need to be angry with a little girl,” Zhao Tianyu smiled and reached out to retrieve the five Sacred Fire Golden Lotuses. He said, “Young lady, you have good eyesight.”

Everyone was nervous, fearing that Zhao Tianyu might make a move. But Zhao Tianyu immediately left instead with the Sacred Fire Golden Lotuses and the four venerables.

This made everyone heave a sigh of relief. Ever since the Blood Moon Divine Son came to the Eastern Desolation, this was the first time he suffered such a great loss. Everyone’s gazes couldn’t help falling onto Ye Qingtian. If Ye Qingtian wasn’t here, Zhao Tianyu definitely wouldn’t let it rest so easily.

Ye Qingtian could still put up a fight, and he could deal with the Orangeclothed Venerable. So if Zhao Tianyu wanted to seize the Sacred Fire Golden Lotuses, he would have to give up on the four venerables. In the end, he could only leave with the five immature golden lotuses and suffer this loss.

Even though Zhao Tianyu left, the cultivators from the other domains were still around. They all looked at the Golden Lotus Flametree and didn’t want to leave empty-handed.

Bai Yunfeng was experienced with this. He looked at these cultivators and said, “Everyone can leave for now. We won’t take it too far and will leave some Sacred Fire Golden Lotuses behind for you guys.”

The cultivators from the other domains were unhappy, but they could do nothing about it. Zhao Tianyu had already left, and they didn’t have the confidence to face the six holy lands.

Bai Yunfeng had already given them face by saying that, so they could only leave for now.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Ye Qingtian is really an underdog. He clearly failed in his breakthrough, but he’s so strong.”

“He’s simply a monster capable of defeating a Quasi-Saint at the Indigo Origin Phase that has grasped a greater dao.”

“If you possess Astral Sword Intent close to complete mastery, dual sword stars, and an ancient sword technique, you can also do it.”

“Isn’t that nonsense? If I could, I would’ve swept through them with my cultivation at the Quasi-Saint Realm with Zhao Tianyu.”

“Who is Bai Yunfeng bluffing? There are so few Sacred Fire Golden Lotuses, and we can only pick the leftovers.”

“It’s a pity that the champions of the heavenly paths and those from the Skysolute City are in the God Burial Mountain Range. Otherwise, the six holy lands would have no position here.”

“The God Burial Mountain Range is a huge opportunity. It concerns the inheritance of an Emperor, and we’re just messing around compared to them.” The cultivators from the other domains were unwilling, but they could do nothing. As expected, the six holy lands took all the matured Sacred Fire Golden Lotuses, leaving behind some immature ones.

“Let’s go according to what Bai Qingyu said and let Ye Qingtian have the one at the top. Ji Haoyu, what do you think?” Bai Yunfeng turned to look at Ji Haoyu. When he said that, those from the other holy lands became quiet. Logically speaking, it was only right for Ye Qingtian to take it because it would be a question if they could leave this place alive if Ye Qingtian didn’t stand out.

But the Sacred Fire Golden Lotus at the very top was too tempting. The leaves were vibrant gold, and the sacred fire at the bud was shining brightly, looking like a Buddhist relic. Who knows if it might contain any ancient secrets?

“I have no opinion about that,” Ji Haoyu said.

Seeing this, the other holy lands could only shake their heads, expressing no issue with it.

Only the yellow-clothed saint disciple from the Ming Cult whispered, “Speaking of which, my junior brother also stood out.”

He was speaking about Xiao Yi, who was heavily injured and unconscious. But the other holy lands only sneered in disdain when they heard that.

“I’m just talking about it and have no issue with it, either.” The yellow-clothed saint disciple quickly shut his mouth when he saw the disdain on everyone’s faces.

Lin Yun didn’t hesitate and stowed the Sacred Fire Golden Lotus.

“Hehe, this is a treasure! I bet there’s a Buddhist Emperor Relic within it. Lin Yun, keep it safe for now. We’ll come back again after everyone leaves and dig out the entire tree,” Lil’ Purple excitedly said from within the Iris Secret Realm.
