Chapter 2338 - Who Am I?

Ghost Owl and Ray Serpent wanted to stop Lin Yun from making a breakthrough, but they were stopped by Ji Zixi, who fought the two of them evenly as she gave off a noble aura when the phoenix bloodline within her body began to boil. Facing her, Ghost Owl and Ray Serpent were forced to retreat instead.

“The phoenix bloodline!”

“Just who the hell is she?”

“It looks like Lin Yun’s identity isn’t simple either… but why haven’t we heard of him before?” Everyone in the surrounding area was dumbfounded. After all, the phoenix bloodline was extremely noble even in the universe, but someone like her remained so low-profile beside Lin Yun, which was incomprehensible.

Mu Xiuhan and Ao Jue were shocked as their eyes became glued to Ji Zixi. Ao Jue enviously said, “He really has a good fortune. Not only did he obtain nine Golden Dao Fruits, but he even had such a beautiful companion.”

“So what? He will only die by going against Wang Jue. Did he think he could turn the tables around after becoming a sixth-stage Saint Lord?” Mu Xiuhan said coldly.

“He can’t. Deities personally guide divine disciples, and deities have protected them before coming to the Heavenly Barren Realm.”

“One has to be a divine disciple if they want to confront another divine disciple. Otherwise, do you really think that I'd be afraid of him?” Ao Jue replied coldly. “He’s too naive, but it’s confusing that Lin Jiangxian and Xiong Tiannan are willing to help him. Do they think he will win?”

The fight was chaotic, but no one was optimistic about Lin Yun. They felt that he was too arrogant and could just leave if he was capable.

The disciples of the Heavenly Sword Pavilion became nervous because they couldn’t join a battle of this level, so they could only wait anxiously.

“Do you guys think that I don’t have any temper?” Wang Jue was thoroughly enraged after being besieged by ten corpse kings and harassed by the Heavenly Divine Sword. When his aura swept out, the Life, Death, and Devour Daos perfectly fused together, forming a Life-Death Domain.

Wang Jue formed a Life-Death Sovereign Seal that smashed apart the heads of five corpse kings. But that wasn’t all. He waved his hand and a terrifying vortex devoured Lin Jiangxian’s sword ray, “Primordial Heavenly Devour Seal!”

With a push of his hand, the sword ray was returned to Lin Jiangxian. He said, “You can have it back!”

After he was done, he snorted and no longer cared about Lin Jiangxian. As for the Life-Death Sovereign Seal, it killed the ten corpse kings, and even the corpse kings couldn’t withstand the life-death aura.

“Damn it…” Xiong Tiannan felt heartache as Wang Jue appeared in front of him before he could even respond.

“Kneel!” Wang Jue descended from the sky with his hand reaching out for Xiong Tiannan’s head.

This naturally frightened Xiong Tiannan, so he roared, “Coffin!”

A golden coffin appeared and stood behind Xiong Tiannan. When the coffin opened up, Xiong Tiannan threw out a mouthful of blood under Wang Jue’s attack and entered the coffin. Standing in the coffin, Xiong Tiannan grinned, “Goodbye! So what if you’re a divine disciple? There’s nothing you can do to me!”

All the coffins containing corpse kings earlier flew over and became a shield in front of him.

“Damn it!” Wang Jue was furious. He then charged over and destroyed all the coffins. But when he reached Xiong Tiannan, the golden coffin was closed. Even when Wang Jue’s Life-Death Sovereign Seal constantly landed on the coffin, it didn’t even manage to shake it.

“Haha! You’re too weak!” Xiong Tiannan laughed from inside the coffin.

When Wang Jue threw two more punches, he only left a slight ripple on the coffin, but no damage. This naturally made Wang Jue furious because he wasn’t able to break open the coffin even after he was bleeding from his fists.Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Holy shit! That works?”

“Haha! Xiong Tiannan is really a ruthless person. He’s practically invincible this way!”

“Hahaha! Even a divine disciple can’t do anything to him!” Everyone was briefly stumped before they began laughing.

Their laughter was sarcastic, making Wang Jue furious. But there was nothing he could do about it now, so he could only retreat.

When he retreated and wanted to go after Lin Yun instead, the coffin slid open with Xiong Tiannan coming out, “Hahaha! I’m back out!”

A lightning bolt flew over and Wang Jue returned, but he was too late. His punch merely landed on the closed coffin.

“Hahaha! I’m back in! What can you do to me?” Xiong Tiannan’s laughter came from within the coffin.

This left Wang Jue furious, and he began attacking the coffin but to no avail. When he left, the coffin opened again and Xiong Tiannan laughed, “I’m back out!”

Wang Jue’s face became dark as he returned with an even faster speed. Even so, Xiong Tiannan was a step faster and hid in the coffin, laughing. This instantly left everyone in the surroundings dumbfounded. This process was repeated five times, nearly driving Wang Jue insane while Xiong Tiannan was excited.

“I’m back out!” The coffin opened and Xiong Tiannan repeatedly taunted Wang Jue.

“Azure Divine Seal!” But Xiong Tiannan miscalculated this time. A crimson seal bloomed on Wang Jue’s forehead. When the three seals combined, they formed into a terrifying seal that flew out, sending the coffin flying and Xiong Tiannan throwing out blood with his bones breaking.

“It looks like I’ve gone a little too far…” Xiong Tiannan bitterly smiled as he looked at the approaching Wang Jue. He taunted Wang Jue too much, so he probably wanted to kill him more than Lin Yun.

“Damn it!” Seeing the Azure Divine Seal flying at him, Xiong Tiannan sighed because he knew that he couldn’t escape death this time.

This made Ji Zixi’s face change as she observed from afar. She wanted to help, but she was too late and had to deal with two opponents.

Lin Jiangxian descended right at that moment, standing before Xiong Tiannan. When she swung her sword, each swing was accompanied by a terrifying aura that swept out with light pillars shooting out with her in the center. Five swords later, a powerful aura swept out when Lin Jiangxian swung her sword, tearing the Azure Divine Seal into two.

This was a terrifying sword that looked as though five elements were re-creating the world. When the sword ray cut apart the Azure Divine Seal, it continued on, forcing Wang Jue to retreat a few hundred meters.

“Five elements…” Wang Jue was shocked with disbelief because Lin Jiangxian had grasped the Five Elements Dao.

But another sword later, Lin Jiangxian, threw out blood and fell onto one knee, which made Wang Jue heave a sigh in relief. This was because Lin Jiangxian didn’t completely grasp the Five Elements Dao, only the surface of it. Because she forcibly tried to use it, she suffered a setback.

“An ant trying to shake a tree,” Wang Jue said coldly as she sent Lin Jiangxian flying away with a wave of his hand. He didn’t kill Lin Jiangxian. She might not be comparable to a divine disciple, but he knew Lin Jiangxian had a close relationship with a deity in the Heavenly Sword Pavilion. It was publicly acknowledged that someone related to a deity couldn’t be killed.

Raising his brow, Wang Jue looked at Xiong Tiannan, and smiled, “Why don’t you try to provoke me again?”

He couldn’t kill Lin Jiangxian, but he had no plans of letting Xiong Tiannan go. He could even put Lin Yun aside because Xiong Tiannan had to die no matter what for taunting him earlier.

Xiong Tiannan smiled, “Who are you scolding?”

“Still trying to play tricks even when facing death? Do you think that I’ll fall for it?!” Wang Jue sneered and grabbed Xiong Tiannan from afar.

“Holy shit, you’re serious? Lin Yun, wake up!” Xiong Tiannan’s survival instincts burst out.

Wang Jue increased the strength on Xiong Tiannan, and smiled, “You think that I’m a fool? How can someone possibly break into the sixth-stage Saint Lord in fifteen minutes? I have plenty of time to deal with you!”

But just when he wanted to exert more force, a sword ray flew over and sent him flying away. The power behind the sword ray was strong enough to push Wang Jue a few meters back even after he landed on the ground.

A figure also appeared before Xiong Tiannan, it was naturally Lin Yun. He looked at Xiong Tiannan, reaching out with a smile, “You kept your promise.”

“I’m just trying to catch his attention, but that fellow was like a mad dog who kept coming after me,” Xiong Tiannan replied.

Lin Yun merely smiled because he would also go after Xiong Tiannan if he were in Wang Jue’s shoes.

“Holy shit! That fellow is coming again! You deal with him!” Xiong Tiannan’s face changed as he ran towards the golden coffin.

Lin Yun only felt a shadow dashing over, but he smiled and clashed with Wang Jue, “Great!”

They exchanged ten moves in a split second. When Lin Yun’s golden pill shone brightly with the two sword canons circulated, the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron flew out from his violet palace. The cauldron seemed to contain a lot of resentment as it devoured all the radiance from the golden pill before turning into an ominous aura that filled Lin Yun’s body.

When Lin Yun’s palm collided with Wang Jue, an ominous aura poured out that sent Wang Jue flying away, throwing out a mouthful of blood. When Wang Jue landed on the ground, he took several steps back again.

Wang Jue raised his head to look at Lin Yun with disbelief and couldn’t believe that Lin Yun held the advantage in the fight. He pointed at Lin Yun, looking like a madman, and asked, “Who the hell are you?! You’re not a nameless person!”

Lin Yun didn’t restrain the ominous aura within his body, and summoned the Flower Burial Sword to his hand. “Who am I? I am Flower Burial Lin Yun, burying people and flowers alike!”

While Wang Jue was shocked, Lin Yun circulated his Nirvana Dao and soared to the sky. Although Wang Jue was prepared for an attack, fear began to spread in his heart when Lin Yun circulated the Nirvana Dao. He only saw Lin Yun move and nothing else; he couldn’t keep up with him.

As Lin Yun raised his brow, he smiled, and he drew a flower with his sword and blood was dripping down.
