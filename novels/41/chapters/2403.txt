Chapter 2404 - Great Phaseless Divine Art

Everyone trembled after hearing what Jiang Yi said. Even Luo Tianxi clenched his fists upon hearing that, and he instantly noticed that the reason the three were here shouldn’t be as simple as wanting to take Lin Yun away. Did that mean that these people couldn’t hold themselves back after being suppressed for so long?

Thinking about it, a cold light flashed in Luo Tianxi’s eyes.

“Something isn’t right,” Ao Jue said.

“What do you mean?” Xiong Tiannan looked baffled.

“The three of them are too arrogant. They might have said that they are here for Lin Yun, but they provoked the Heavenly Seal Emperor first and even provoked the ancestral deity now,” Ao Jue said.

Xiong Tiannan scratched his head. He was a crude person, and wouldn’t think that much. Seeing that he still didn’t get it, Ao Jue said, “Their true objective is probably Heaven’s Gate, and Lin Yun is just an excuse.”

“How is that possible? They dare to provoke Heaven’s Gate?” Xiong Tiannan was surprised.

Ao Jue came from a demonic sect, and he had a meticulous heart. He smiled, “In a nutshell, the Dao Sect, Heavenly Sword Pavilion, and Shadow Divine Palace only lost their chief disciples. It might have a significant influence, but there’s no need for those three to come to Heaven’s Gate. It’s just an excuse. They wanted to use Lin Yun as a reason to suppress the Heavenly Barren Banquet’s reputation.

“After all, with so many banquets being held here over the years, the ancestral deity’s disciples have also increased, and they’re famous throughout the three thousand realms. This is a huge connection, and it would be a lie that the Dao Sect doesn’t envy that. Don’t forget that they also have an Ancestral Stage expert. Heaven’s Gate doesn’t have an official divine son, so this is the perfect opportunity. The moment they suppress all of the disciples in Heaven’s Gate, do you think the banquet can continue to be held in the future?”

Xiong Tiannan finally understood what was happening and asked, “What should we do now?”

“Nothing. This is a blatant scheme, and the Emperor can’t make a move against them, nor could the other venerables. If they did that, they would’ve lost,” Ao Jue said, spreading his arms apart.

Not only Ao Jue but the many geniuses here also noticed something wasn’t right. As for everyone from Heaven’s Gate, they were anxious but could only suck it up.

Jiang Yi arrogantly said, “Is there no one else? Is this the best Heaven’s Gate has to offer?”

His arrogance made the disciples of Heaven’s Gate furious, and they gritted their teeth. But the surroundings were silent because Jiang Yi had displayed terrifying strength earlier. Many people’s gazes fell onto Feng Bumao, Xia Qingyun, Ye Wuhen, and the other ancestral deity’s disciples.

Ye Wuhen wanted to fight, but Xia Qingyun stopped him since no one could see through Jiang Yi’s strength yet. He was the future divine son, and it was destined for his name to spread throughout the three thousand realms. So she couldn’t allow him to fall before he could even rise.

Lin Yun’s eyes flashed. Did these people think that they were invincible? Or did they think I was so weak they could knead me however they wanted? Or were they here for Heaven’s Gate to begin with? Probably a mix of both.

Jiang Yi smiled, “The entire Heaven’s Gate doesn’t even have anyone capable of fighting me?”

Right then, a figure stood out, and he coldly said, “Do you think that there’s no one in Heaven’s Gate? I might be unable to defeat a divine son like you, but we’re not afraid of a fight!”

Another person also stood out. It was Yan Xiu and Hun Wuding who went on the stage, “We’ll fight!”

The eyes of everyone in Heaven’s Gate became bright. They might not be as famous as Feng Bumao and Ye Wuhen, but they weren’t weak and kept a low profile amongst the ancestral deity’s disciples.

Jiang Yi sneered and wore a playful expression. He said, “You two can come at me together. Otherwise, I can’t even do my warm-up.”

He knew that Feng Bumao was trying to make him reveal his trump cards.

“Heavenly Divine Glory Fist!” Hun Wuding released his saint energy with his punch, forming a crimson lightning bolt. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Great!” Jiang Yi laughed as he pushed his palm forth. When the punch and palm clashed, a powerful shockwave swept out that caused the entire stage to tremble. The clash made Hun Wuding take a few steps back, but at least he wasn’t defeated in just one exchange.

Jiang Yi was surprised, before he smiled, “Not bad, but nothing too impressive.”

“I haven’t even got started yet!” Hun Wuding was furious as he performed the Heavenly Divine Glory Fist again.

“Let me see your strength, then.” Jiang Yi was enveloped in a golden radiance as he approached Hun Wuding and only used one hand to fight.

Under the golden radiance, Hun Wuding was shocked to discover that his saint energy was slowly being devoured. In just ten-odd moves, Hun Wuding’s face changed after exhausting too much saint energy. He was inwardly shocked since his most significant advantage was his cultivation. How did he manage to do that? He is devouring my saint energy...

Hun Wuding cultivated the Heavenly Divine Glory Art, an unusual technique that could allow someone to contain ten times or ten-odd times the normal amount of saint energy. He was given this cultivation technique due to his unique physique.

But the situation was dangerous, and Hun Wuding was sent flying away after ten-odd moves. His face was pale, with white hair appearing on his head, looking as though he had instantly become much older. On the contrary, Jiang Yi didn’t take a step back and didn’t even exhaust a tiny bit of his saint energy. His cultivation even improved instead.

“That seems to be the Great Phaseless Divine Art of the Shadow Divine Palace. It’s even more profound than Devour Dao, which is ridiculous.”

“This is a demonic cultivation technique that will drive one insane if they’re not careful. It looks like Jiang Yi has reached greater mastery in it.” Everyone was shocked, with fear on their faces.

When Yan Xiu saw that Hun Wuding was so easily defeated, he charged forth with his sword. He was a swordsman and used to be famous in Heaven’s Gate, grasping eighteen different Sovereign Daos. He had fused all the Sovereign Daos into his Sword Dao, forming a Sword Domain that was unique to him.

When he thrusted his sword, the eighteen Sovereign Daos combined and formed a vortex of sword aura. His Sword Domain was powerful, looking like it wanted to devour heaven and earth. Facing him, even Jiang Yi frowned as the golden radiance he released was ripped apart by the sword aura, forcing him to take a few steps back.

Everyone’s eyes lit up because a swordsman seemed to be the bane of Jiang Yi.

“Trigram Sword Dance!” Yan Xiu began to spin in the air, with the surrounding space becoming blurred. This shocked everyone because Yan Xiu’s attainment in the sword was much stronger than Ji Zhangkong's. Judging from the aura he gave off, he was even stronger than Lin Yun.

“What a powerful sword aura! His sword intent might not be as strong as Lin Yun’s, but just the aura he gives off is a lot stronger.”

“Don’t forget that he’s the disciple of an ancestral deity.”

“It looks like Yan Xiu will turn the tables around.”

Everyone in the surrounding area was calmly analyzing the fight and didn’t dare to come up with any conclusion. But everyone noticed that Jiang Yi had one hand behind his back throughout the fight.

When he suddenly reached out with his right hand, Jiang Yi’s hands clasped together and released a dazzling radiance, “Great Phaseless Divine Ray!”

As light surged, Yan Xiu’s sword aura was utterly devoured. When Jiang Yi pushed a palm forth, a ‘卍’ word flew out, destroying Jiang Yi’s Sword Domain.

Seeing this, everyone was shocked because they didn’t expect the Great Phaseless Divine Art to be so powerful. Yan Xiu’s sword aura was ripped apart, and his sword was knocked flying away. But even when facing this situation, Yan Xiu didn’t take a step back and attacked instead, forming a seal with his left hand and pushing his right palm forth, which his sword flew out from.

All the dispersed sword aura also formed into a hundred and eight light beams with a massive aura spreading out, and the massive sword aura formed a majestic painting.

This made everyone exclaim. They were shocked that Yan Xiu could still unleash such a terrifying attack in a desperate strait. Even Lin Yun couldn’t help praising Yan Xiu, a Sword Saint.

But something unexpected occurred as Jiang Yi pushed his hands to the sky, and he roared, “Myriad Union!”

When he finished chanting, he took a deep breath and devoured all the phenomena. The hundred and eight beams were also consumed by him, including Yan Xiu’s sword, before he could even unleash his attack. This made Yan Xiu’s aura disappear, with the stage calming down.

Yan Xiu was shocked, and he said with disbelief, “H... How is this possible...?”

Jiang Yi said, “What’s impossible about it? Don’t look like a country bumpkin. Sword Dao is an unstable factor in heaven and earth, but all swordsmen like to put on an act,” Jiang Yi said. “You have already lost, and you still want to fight? Is there any meaning behind it? This is why I hate swordsmen.”

He pushed his palm forth, sending Jiang Yi flying away, clashing against the palace. When an explosion came from the palace, Yan Xiu fell onto the ground with his bones broken.
