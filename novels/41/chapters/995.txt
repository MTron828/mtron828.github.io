Chapter 996 - If We’re Fated

Lin Yun was shocked by Jiang Ling. He couldn’t help but wonder how powerful the cloth was.

“It’s called the Firmament Battle Cloth. It has had great power since ancient times and the user doesn’t need to be strong. Even an ordinary person can unleash great prowess with it…” Jiang Ling then continued, “But this artifact was damaged from the ancient battle. So I’ll seal it within your body and it will unseal itself when your life is endangered.”

With a wave of his hand, Jiang Ling summoned a white cloth before Lin Yun. This cloth looked ordinary and wasn’t impressive. It even gave Lin Yun a feeling as though it was another person.

This is the Firmament Battle Cloth? Lin Yun frowned and tried to touch the white cloth. But the moment he came in contact with it, a boundless pressure swept out. The pressure crushed his body, sending him far away while spitting up blood.

Before Lin Yun could clean the blood off his lips, fear rose in his eyes. The ancient runes intertwined on the surface of the cloth and shined like a starry sky. They revolved around the cloth with an ancient aura.

The cloth looked close, yet felt so far. It also had a pressure that tried to force him to his knees. How can a battle cloth emit such power?

“Don’t touch it. It’s still not yours.” Jiang Ling smiled before pointing his finger forward. Then, the cloth flew towards Lin Yun and merged with his body. “Seal!” roared Jiang Ling.

Under Lin Yun’s shocked gaze, the cloth merged with his body and was nowhere to be found.

“The origin of this cloth is huge. So don’t use it carelessly because it’s too powerful. You don’t even need to be strong to use it. I’ve set a seal on it so that it will only help you when your life is threatened. This is to ensure that you won’t get bullied by those old fogeys,” said Jiang Ling.

“Thank you, senior.” Lin Yun kept smiling because the inheritance had far exceeded his imagination. Even if this was an opportunity far surpassing fortune, the Azure Dragon True Bone was more than enough for him. Jiang Ling didn’t need to give him something so precious.

“I’ve been waiting for a long time and you’re the best successor. I won’t be able to stay for long anyway.” Jiang Ling waved his hand and continued, “In the future, when the tribulation comes, I hope that you will make a stand. This era hasn’t been calm since it was born, and it’s filled with difficulties.”

“What do you mean?” Lin Yun was baffled when he heard that.

“You’ll know one day. Oh, let me give you a seal to activate the battle cloth. I have to add some restrictions to it so you can’t use it to suppress geniuses in the same cultivation as you. Using it too often won’t benefit you. Instead, it will bring you trouble.”

Lin Yun easily learned the Firmament Saint Seal. According to what Jiang Ling said, he couldn’t use it unless absolutely necessary. Furthermore, he would be in a weakened state for a long time if he activated the seal. Lin Yun didn’t really care since he knew it wasn’t helpful for his growth to rely on external help.

“That’s it then. There’s nothing else for me to give you. I only have a word of advice. If you can’t fight, run. There’s no humiliation in running. After all, you can always take revenge in the future. However, you have to be alive to do that,” smiled Jiang Ling.

“Coincidentally, you happen to have a technique to run. But you haven’t sensed the essence in it and aren't able to bring out its full power,” said Jiang Ling.

“Are you talking about the Golden Crow Nine Transformations?” Lin Yun asked. Lin Yun couldn’t think of any way he could increase the power of this monarch fortune martial technique because he had already reached a high level in it.

“Well…fine.” Jiang Ling suddenly appeared before Lin Yun and tapped the latter’s forehead. In the next second, violent flames leaked out of Lin Yun as a golden brilliance shined.

When the Golden Crow Nine Transformations began to circulate, a series of cracking sounds came from Lin Yun’s body that made his face distorted with pain and let out a scream. When the golden crow energy accumulated to the limit behind him, an explosion sounded out as a pair of golden wings unfolded.

This brought great shock to Lin Yun because the wings felt like his own. He could even pour his origin energy into them with a single thought. When the golden wings swelled and flapped, he flew a few dozen meters into the sky at an unbelievable speed.

“Golden Crow Wings?” Lin Yun had disbelief in his eyes because he could tell that he would reach an unbelievable speed by flapping his wings. The power contained in the wings was fearsome. Is this the genuine Glorysun Constellation Palace inheritance? When Lin Yun thought about the Golden Crow Nine Transformations again, he realized that he had a lot of enlightenments.

“I see…” Lin Yun began to form a seal and formed a completely new Golden Crow Seal. This time, the seal had had a pair of wings attached. It looked similar to the winged human when he executed the Divine Glorysun Fist, but there were small differences in power.

“You’re pretty quick at comprehending. With this, I don’t have to worry that you’ll lose your life anymore,” smiled Jiang Ling as his figure began to fade. Clearly, he had used up all his remaining energy to help Lin Yun manifest the Golden Crow wings.

“Senior!” Lin Yun immediately dispelled the pair of wings and exclaimed.

“We might be able to meet again in the future if we’re fated to. Now that I’ve found you, there’s no need for me to stay here. I might as well use my remaining energy to push your cultivation to the third soul Heavenly Soul Realm,” said Jiang Ling in an even more weakened voice before he gradually disappeared.

As soon as Jiang Ling disappeared, the palace that Lin Yun was in also disappeared. Lin Yun found himself back in the blood ocean as if everything was a dream. But when he sensed the Azure Dragon True Bone, he knew that it wasn’t a dream. He really obtained the opportunity above fortune.

“Meet again if we’re fated? Is senior Jiang Ling still alive?” Lin Yun muttered as he thought through things. However, the Azure Dragon Lord also said that he couldn’t protect his safety… So why couldn’t he if he was still alive?

“This is really confusing. Forget it. I should focus on making a breakthrough first.” Lin Yun’s eyes flickered because reaching the third soul Heavenly Soul Realm required an immense accumulation. However, the blood ocean was probably enough. With the Azure Dragon True Bone and blood ocean, it shouldn’t be a problem for him to make the breakthrough.

Back in the plaza, many people were on their stages. After going through the test, there were many happy and many sad people.

The worst cultivator among the crowd had obtained an overlord fortune martial technique and others had obtained an imperial fortune martial technique. One must know that advanced fortune martial techniques were rare in Kunlun Realm.

Then again, none of their harvests were comparable to the likes of Qin Lin and Jun Mengchen. Both of them had obtained an imperial fortune martial technique, which could be considered a considerable harvest. Their faces were full of joy at the moment. However, when they locked eyes with Pei Xue, they were full of reluctance. After all, none of them were able to obtain the opportunity above fortune.

“The inheritance in the stage belonging to the azure dragon’s claws wasn't low. It even had an imperial fortune palm technique!” Jun Mengchen was satisfied with his harvest. Of course, he wouldn’t be satisfied with a weak martial technique.

“Palm technique? Why don’t I take a look at it? The technique I obtained in the azure dragon’s tail isn’t simple, so I can swap it with you.” A voice sounded out, which made Jun Mengchen frown his brows.

When he found the source of the voice, he saw Yu Haotian. Looking at Yu Haotian, his eyes flashed with disdain, “Forget about it. The azure dragon’s tail might be unique, but it’s just the tail. If it’s not for the fact that we weren’t interested in it, there’s no way you could have obtained it. If you want to swap, let me take a look at your inheritance first and see if it’s worth anything.”

Yu Haotian wasn’t furious when he heard that and smiled, “The seven heads indeed…you guys are really aloof.”

Yu Haotian’s tone made Jun Mengchen unhappy. “So what if we look down on you? Who the hell do you think you are?”

“Interesting. It appears that you still have no idea about your current situation, Jun Mengchen!” Yu Haotian laughed and stood up from his stage. When he stood up, a powerful aura was unleashed. This instantly drew everyone’s attention as they felt chills run down their spines.
