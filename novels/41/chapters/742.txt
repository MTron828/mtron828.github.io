Chapter 743 - Quasi-Spiritual Sword Intent

Lin Yun’s action was bold, but not many people noticed him in the chaos. Aside from Long Hao, everyone else was having difficulty protecting themselves from the demonic beasts.

The Mountainshaking Demonic Ape became furious seeing that Lin Yun was running on its weapon and began to swing it around. It didn’t take long for Lin Yun to be thrown off. After Lin Yun was thrown off, he left behind countless afterimages in the air like smoke.

But the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape couldn’t be bothered as it snorted black air from its nose and continued to brandish the stone pillar. But before it could unleash its might, Lin Yun’s afterimages radiated with moonlight through the air.

When Lin Yun stabbed his sword out, the sky reflected that radiant light of the Flower Burial Sword and the moon. This time, he was using the Aquaselenic Sword–Moon Reflection. Before the Moon Reflection could react, Lin Yun had already stabbed his sword into the ape’s temple.

But when Lin Yun’s sword stabbed the ape’s temple, a metallic collision numbed his arm. He only managed to leave behind a three inch wound as blood began to flow down and cover the ape’s face. It might seem shocking, but it was only a light injury.

“Retreat!” Lin Yun panicked as he retreated because he was too close to the ape. He could even sense the heat from the flames in the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape’s eyes. Right now, the pain from Lin Yun’s attack was making the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape go into a frenzy and roar furiously.

As the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape unleashed a ferocious roar, the origin energy in Lin Yun’s body began to fluctuate. The petals of the Iris Flower started to tremble within Lin Yun’s violet palace. But before Lin Yun could stabilize himself in mid-air, the stone pillar flew over like a mountain.

Lin Yun didn’t even have time to wipe the blood off his lips before he had to stab his sword at the incoming pillar. His sword pierced the sword pillar by half an inch, leaving cracks on the surface of it and causing stone dust to fall.

But a split second later, a powerful force exploded out from the pillar that sent him flying away. When Lin Yun was in mid-air, he stretched his left hand out as his fingers turned emerald. Then, he began to wiggle his fingers in the air.

As an Iris Flower bloomed on the back of his hand while he wiggled his fingers and the outline of an Iris Flower formed behind him.

Heart Connection, Spiritual Sword!

The purple sword ray lit up the darkness as it streaked across the sky and stabbed the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape’s neck. The huge impact from his attack made the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape take several steps back. Each of the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape’s steps caused the ground to tremble violently and killed many demonic beasts in the surroundings.

Luminous Moon!

Despite the success, Lin Yun didn’t stop his momentum. With his sword rays, he formed a net and stabbed his sword two more times.

Myriad Frost!

Heavenly Cloud Shatter!

The terrifying killing move clashed with the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape. Using his ferocious attacks, he was actually able to suppress the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape.

But that wasn’t all as Lin Yun even used the Flowing Wind Sword. It was the sword technique he used when he was still in the Azuresky Sect. Although it had been a long time since he used it, the move was still deeply engraved in his heart. As blood splattered out, the demonic beasts who charged at him were torn into pieces.

“Is there finally a gap?” Lin Yun turned to look at Zuo Yun and the rest tearing a hole in the horde of demonic beasts, allowing the commoners to run for their lives. But in the next second, a ferocious roar drew Lin Yun’s attention back to the battlefield as the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape crawled back up like it wasn’t injured.

Rage manifested into a demonic aura around the Moutnainshaking Demonic Ape as it turned its head around looking for Lin Yun.

“What thick skin.” Lin Yun shook his head and stabbed his sword out before retreating. As he ran, he didn’t forget to attack and kill the demonic beasts blocking his path. Although there were demonic beasts who survived his assault, they were soon squashed to death by the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape.

The Mountainshaking Demonic Ape was thoroughly enraged. Stomping its foot on the ground, the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape landed in front of Lin Yun and brandished the stone pillar in its hand over.

Overlord Sword—Thunderbolt Slash!

Lin Yun slightly tilted his body before facing the stone pillar. He might seem tiny compared to the ape, but the sword aura coming from him wasn’t any weaker. The sword clashed with the stone pillar once more, but Lin Yun wasn’t sent flying away this time.

Before the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape could react, Lin Yun raised his hand and slashed out another sword. This time, it was the Overlord Sword—Solar Slash! His sword aura manifested into a pair of wings around him and flapped, unleashing boundless domineering aura out into the surroundings as Lin Yun’s sword descended.

This attack shocked the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape as it held onto the stone pillar and raised it to defend. When the Flower Burial Sword collided with the stone pillar once more, the boundless sword aura pushed the colossal demonic ape back.

Overlord Sword—Big Bang!

But Lin Yun clearly wasn’t satisfied as he continued his attack. This time, the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape didn’t dare to be careless as it stomped on the ground and retreated a few hundred meters. But the demonic aura was still gathering on its body before manifesting into black flames.

When the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape landed on the ground, it took advantage of the momentum and pounced forward, swinging its stone pillar down. When its pillar collided with the sword, it instantly crushed the sword aura manifested by Lin Yun.

Like a broken kite, Lin Yun fell from the sky. But the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape wasn’t exactly in a great position either. Although it had shattered the star manifested by Lin Yun, Lin Yun’s sword intent still didn't disperse as countless fireflies continued to surround it. When the fireflies covered the demonic ape, they instantly left thousands of wounds on the demonic beast.

The Mountainshaking Demonic Ape looked like it was being hit by countless meteorites. Suddenly, it unleashed a mournful howl.

“This demonic ape…” Lin Yun held onto his chest with a helpless expression because he could tell that the demonic ape was still brimming with vitality from its howl.

Lil’ Red… Just when Lin Yun was about to call out for the Dragon Blooded Horse, he froze because he realized that Lil’ red was no longer around. In the past, Lil’ Red had been his safety rope that pulled him out of danger. He was so used to Lil’ Red being around that he forgot about its current state.

Before the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape could get back up, Lin Yun shoved pellets in his mouth and retracted his aura before heading for Zuo Yun. A long time later, the demonic ape got back on its feet as its roar gradually weakened.

Turning his head around, Lin Yun was only able to see the torrential flames coming from Inkwater City. Vaguely, he could see darkness in the flames and manifestations of negative emotions that soared towards the clouds. The clouds greedily devoured the negative emotions, which was quite a bizarre scene. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“This…” Lin Yun locked his brows together upon seeing this scene. He had seen demonic beasts slaughter commoners in the past, but he had never seen such a phenomenon before. This looked like an ancient sacrifice filled with darkness and evil. He wasn’t sure if this was a phenomenon created whenever a city was broken. Then again, was this something that had happened in the past that he simply didn’t notice?

A brief moment later, Lin Yun gathered himself. It wasn’t that he didn’t see it in the past, but he couldn’t. He only managed to see it after his xiantian sword intent became a lot keener. Although he didn’t reach the spiritual sword intent, his bottleneck had loosen up and his sword intent was at least 50% stronger than before.

He was currently in a situation between the pinnacle xiantian sword intent and spiritual sword intent. It would be more accurate to call it the quasi-spiritual sword intent.

“Well, it’s not my job to care about this. I believe there are people in the Ancient Southern Domain who have already noticed it.” Lin Yun focused his gaze and no longer dwelt on the evil phenomenon.

Four hours later, when dawn was about to arrive, Lin Yun sensed the aura of Zuo Yun and the rest in the forest. There were many complicated auras, but Lin Yun easily sorted through everyone with his quasi-spiritual sword intent.

There was a bonfire beside Zuo Yun and Feng Ye. They didn’t follow the commoners and other cultivators who were headed towards Swordmire City. They had clearly stopped here on purpose to wait for Lin Yun.

Suddenly, their faces changed at the same time as they raised their heads and saw Lin Yun walking over.

This instantly brought joy to Feng Ye’s face as he stood up and smiled, “Lin Yun!”

“Are you injured?” Zuo Yun asked as he walked over.

“It’s fine. I won’t be dying anytime soon,” replied Lin Yun casually as he placed the Flower Burial Sword to the side.

Zuo Yun looked at Lin Yun with shock because he had watched Lin Yun and the Mountainshaking Demonic Ape fight right before he left. The scene was too shocking and he couldn’t even describe his shock with words.

But even more shocking was that Lin Yun returned unscathed. Zuo Yun hadn’t expected this. Just what did Lin Yun experience in the last six months?

While Zuo Yun was feeling shocked inwardly, wind blew by as Long Hao walked over with a smile. “Formidable. What sword technique did you use at the end of the fight? That sword technique was shockingly overbearing since you managed to suppress an overlord demonic beast with it.”

“Who is this? Do you know him?” Feng Ye asked.

“He’s the Azure Dragon Seeking Envoy from the Sword Alliance.” Lin Yun replied honestly, which made Long Hao’s face freeze. He clearly didn’t expect Lin Yun to be so honest.

The Sword Alliance might not be a mysterious organization, but he couldn’t reveal his identity willy nilly.

“I’ve heard of it. It appears to have a huge origin. What does an Azure Dragon Seeking Envoy do?” Feng Ye asked.

“They’re responsible for finding geniuses, giving them resources, and helping them to grow,” replied Lin Yun.

Lin Yun’s reply instantly made Feng Ye’s eyes lit up as he looked at Long Hao, “Hey, what do you think of me? I’m Feng Ye and I possess the barbarian bloodline. I also have an impressive comprehension talent.”

“We only accept swordsmen,” smiled Long Hao awkwardly.

“Hehe, I can change. It might be trained in fist techniques, but I have also tried other weapons in the past. I’ll be a swordsman in the future.” Feng Ye wouldn’t let Long Hao back out. Taking advantage of this moment, Lin Yun and Zuo Yun quietly left to go somewhere further away.

“What do you intend to do in the future?” asked Zuo Yun.

“I’ll head to Swordmire City and look at the geniuses on Dragoncloud Ranking. I’ll head back to the Great Qin Empire when the beast tide is over.” This was a rough outline of Lin Yun’s plans. If it was possible, he even wanted to pay the Falling Dragon Slope a visit before going back.

There was a sword intent there that he could observe. Perhaps it would be an opportunity for him to make a breakthrough into the spiritual sword intent.

“The Great Qin Empire...I also wish to return to take a look. But it’s a pity that I already betrayed the Primal Origin Sect,” said Zuo Yun helplessly. He had already betrayed the sect, so Wen Yanbo definitely wouldn’t let him go.

“Come to the Sword Firmament Pavilion then,” said Lin Yun.

“That doesn’t seem right…” said Zuo Yun.

“It doesn’t seem right, but you’re my friend,” replied Lin Yun.

His words left Zuo Yun briefly stunned before he smiled, “Alright.”
