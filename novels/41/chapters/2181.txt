Chapter 2182 - Young Master Yun's Sword

Zhou Muyang was defeated in an embarrassing manner, and threw out a mouthful of black blood after taking a few steps, losing consciousness on the spot.

Seeing this, the other representatives from the Upper Nine Peaks were shocked, especially the saint disciples who wanted to step out. They all felt their scalps go numb with fear reflected in their eyes.

“As expected of the former Heavenly Yin Holy Son, Wang Zai is a tough opponent.”

“I heard that he once had an opportunity at the God Burial Mountain Range and comprehended some space dao. This is why his Void Step is so unpredictable.”

“Combining Void Step and space dao is bigger than one plus one, and I’m afraid no one can touch him.”

“He seemed to be targeting Ye Qingtian by saying that swordsmen were garbage.” Everyone else from the Upper Nine Peaks were shocked. There were some who were unconvinced, but they were stopped by their seniors when they wanted to make a move.

“Even if you have a higher cultivation than him, it’s useless if you can’t touch him. Not to mention his martial intent isn’t weak.” Everyone began to discuss amongst themselves, but no one dared to step forth.

Wang Zai smiled, “You guys can come at me together if you want. I already can’t wait to offer the incense.”

“Wang Zai, let me fight you!” A person stood out. This was the Fire Manipulation Peak’s Bai Yufan. He was a descendant of the Bai Clan, and his status wasn’t at all inferior to Wang Zai. Most importantly, he had defeated Wang Zai before in the past. They fought three times, and he won three times.

“Your Wang Clan isn’t the overlord of the Heavenly Dao Sect!” Bai Yufan said fearlessly.

Seeing that Bai Yufan stepped forth, Wang Zai’s expression became serious, and he coldly said, “Bai Yufan, I would have come after you even if you didn’t stand out. Don’t regret it.”

“You’re merely someone who was defeated by me, so cut the crap.” Bai Yufan reached out as he soared to the sky, giving off a high temperature. When he threw his punch, the flames condensed into a huge fist covered with golden runes.

Wang Zai repeated his old trick and used the Void Step to dodge the attack. But Bai Yufan’s punch shattered space, forcing Wang Zai to reveal himself.

“Pitiful tricks,” Wang Zai said coldly as he wiped the blood off his lips. He summoned a whip with lightning flickering on it. When he lashed out, the whip released a sharp dragon’s roar, “Thunder Dragon Whip!”

As the whip began to expand, dragon runes appeared on the whip, and it soon reached over ten feet in size, releasing a powerful pressure. It turned out that this was a Threespirit Glory Saint Artifact.

“A Threespirit Glory Saint Artifact?!”

“The Wang Clan really has a strong foundation to give a Threespirit Glory Saint Artifact to a Quasi-Saint.”

“It looks like Bai Yufan will lose even if he can deal with Wang Zai’s Void Step!”

Wang Zai held onto the Thunder Dragon Whip, grasping the advantage and was no longer afraid of Bai Yufan’s attacks. In just ten-odd moves, there were fragments of flames in the surrounding space.

When Bai Yufan unleashed his attacks, all his attacks shattered before they could even get close to Wang Zai.

“Ha!” Wang Zai sneered with murderous intent reflected in his eyes as he poured his saint aura into the whip. His whip was accompanied with a dragon’s roar that manifested into a dragon, looking like an awakened True Dragon.

“Divine Fire Mountain!” Bai Yufan took a deep breath and circulated the saint aura within his body. When the mountain appeared, it began to fuse with the constellation, and he appeared to have become a mountain fending off the awakened dragon.

Under Wang Zai’s attacks, the mountain stood firmly with faint ripples spreading out. Bai Yufan sneered, “Looks like it’s nothing impressive after all!”

Just when Bai Yufan was wearing a smug look, Wang Zai sneered, and he shook his wrist. The dragon was like a spear with space being compressed. When a powerful explosion swept out, the mountain collapsed, and the dragon lashed out with its claw to send Bai Yufan flying away.

“You dare to fight me with such pitiful tricks?” Wang Zai became even more arrogant after gaining the upper hand. When he lashed out his whip, it would unleash great power with every strike.

Bai Yufan was barely holding his front, before he was sent flying away ten-odd lashes later. Blood splashed from his body, and he was caught by a senior from the Bai Clan.

“Who else?!” Wang Zai roared as the Thunder Dragon Whip left behind a huge crack on the stage, scaring everyone to the point that they didn’t dare to speak.

“I surrender!”

“I surrender!”

“I surrender!”

Under Wang Zai’s gaze, the others from the Upper Nine Peaks admitted defeat. Very quickly, after the other peaks admitted defeat, everyone’s gazes fell onto Lin Yun.

“Ye Qingtian, it’s your turn now!” Wang Zai wasn’t polite with his words, and he looked at Lin Yun arrogantly.

“You can have the honor of offering the incense if you want,” Lin Yun soon made his decision after a brief pondering. It was already enough for him to obtain a spot amongst the Upper Nine Peaks, and he had enough limelight. The Indigothunder Peak Master wasn’t wrong, and there was nothing wrong with keeping a low-profile.

After hearing what Lin Yun said, everyone looked disappointed. They thought that there would be a battle between Wang Zai and the Heavenly Dragon Lord, but it made sense after a brief pondering. After all, Wang Zai was at the pinnacle of the Heavenly Origin Phase’s first stage, not to mention he grasped a Threespirit Glory Saint Artifact like the Thunder Dragon Whip and grasped a portion of space dao.

Wang Zai’s comprehensive strength was terrifying, and there was no need for Ye Qingtian to clash with Wang Zai head-on with his cultivation. Bai Yufan wasn’t weak, but even he was defeated. So there was nothing wrong with Ye Qingtian’s decision.

“Is that all the Heavenly Dragon Lord has?” Wang Zai squinted. He became even more arrogant after being the ultimate winner, and he didn’t hold back his words against Lin Yun.

“I always have a good temper, but I’m afraid you’re misunderstanding something,” Lin Yun smiled.

“It’s fine for you to give up. Everyone has admitted defeat before me, so you should do the same,” Wang Zai looked arrogant and had no intentions of letting Lin Yun go, taking it even further.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Do I really have to admit defeat?” Lin Yun dropped his smile.

“It’s fine if you don’t want to admit defeat, you’ll just have to fight me,” Wang Zai teased.

On the high platform, the Thousand Plume Great Saint said, “Wind Rein Great Saint, hasn’t he taken it a little too far when Ye Qingtian has taken a step back?”

The Wind Rein Great Saint smiled, “It’s normal for young men to have some temper. After all, the ceremony needs some commotion or it would be too boring.”

The Thousand Plume Great Saint frowned and said nothing about it.

“Don’t worry. Wang Zai knows what he’s doing, and he won’t kill the Heavenly Dragon Lord in public. At most, he would just break Ye Qingtian’s limbs,” the Wind Rein Great Saint comforted.

The Thousand Plume Great Saint looked at the Wind Rein Great Saint deeply, then said, “You’re overthinking it. I’m afraid that Ye Qingtian won’t be able to hold himself back.”

The Wind Rein Great Saint nearly burst into laughter. He didn’t bother concealing his intentions at all, and he smiled, “It looks like the Thousand Plume Great Saint has become old. If you are lacking in eyesight, you should let go of your position as the Dao Yang Palace’s palace master.”

But the Thousand Plume Great Saint merely sneered and said nothing else.

On the stage, Wang Zai took it even further, and grinned, “Heavenly Dragon Lord, don’t tell me that you don’t have the courage to do what? It’s fine if you want to give up, you just have to admit defeat like everyone else. Or do you think that you’re special just because you’re the Heavenly Dragon Lord?”

Lin Yun raised his head and looked at Wang Zai coldly.

“Ye Qingtian, weren’t you almighty earlier? What’s the matter? Are you afraid now?” Wang Zai carried on, and he had his emotions all pent up when Lin Yun stole his limelight earlier.

“Since you want to fight, let us have some fun, then,” Lin Yun said as he sat down.

“Come here!” Wang Zai roared, and he swung the Thunder Dragon Whip, destroying everything in the path of the whip with fine cracks appearing in the space, and the terrifying dragon aura it gave off even sent the slabs on the ground flying away.

The stage was fortified with spiritual arrays, and it was tough for a Quasi-Saint to leave behind any marks on the stage. But when the Thunder Dragon Whip was about to get close to Lin Yun, it was knocked back by a bell as a terrifying sword aura swept out from Lin Yun.

“The Astral Sword Intent!” The corner of Wang Zai’s lips twitched, and his face became ugly. Ye Qingtian was also using the Astral Sword Intent, but it was on a whole new level than Zhou Muyang.

“I don’t believe that I can’t deal with you! Swordsmen are all garbage!” Wang Zai’s face became sinister as he roared. The thirty-six layers of heavenly screens overlapped behind him, and they formed into an ancient ‘Thunder’ word.

When the whip was knocked flying away, it manifested into a Thunder Dragon that coiled around Wang Zai, and the latter’s aura would increase whenever it coiled around him, pushing the dragon’s aura to a terrifying height.

When the Thunder Dragon dashed out, space was like a shattered mirror that was destroyed by the Thunder Dragon. The rumbling sound that it produced burst the eardrums of many of the disciples present.

But Lin Yun remained seated on the ground as he flicked his finger. Accompanied with a sword vibration, thousands of galaxies spread out. A dazzling radiance and lightning tore apart the horizon that overlapped on the stage. When the radiance settled down, everyone looked at the stage to see Wang Zai on his knees.

Blood was dripping out of Wang Zai’s lips with half a sword revealed on his chest, and the other half was plunged into his body. Wang Zai was grabbing onto the sword as though the sword would pierce through his body if he loosened his grip on it.

“Ye Qingtian!” Wang Zai’s eyes became red with his hair scattered.

But Lin Yun didn’t take a look at him and knocked the sword scabbard on the ground. When a sword vibration echoed, the Flower Burial Sword returned to the scabbard.

As for Wang Zai, the Flower Burial Sword had pierced through his chest despite his effort, and everything took place too quickly. No one had any idea if they heard the sword vibrate first or if Lin Yun’s sword struck first. Right from the beginning, Lin Yun remained seated on the ground without moving a step.
