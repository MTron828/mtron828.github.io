Chapter 312 - One Who Takes The Flag Wins

Everyone was shocked to see someone flying out without any vitality. It didn’t matter who it was because that person was definitely dead. When they thought of how four people ganged up on Lin Yun, they subconsciously thought that it was Lin Yun who died. Even Luo Feng had the same thought.

A brief silence lasted on the observation platform before someone yelled out that Lin Yun was dead and caused a huge uproar. It didn’t matter much if someone else died, after all, many disciples already lost their lives in the competition. However, Lin Yun wasn’t just anyone. He was someone who rang the Phoenix Plum, not to mention that he displayed unbelievable potential in the Alliance-Union Battle.

After all, he was the youngest among the five participants. He was only seventeen and he had great prospects ahead of him. So everyone found it a pity that Lin Yun died. Many people had expected that he would be defeated, but no one had expected that he would be killed.

“Haha, that bastard is finally dead!” Wang Yan’s face was covered with joy and a fanatic expression. Lin Yun had been a thorn in his eye, not to mention Lin Yun was also the reason why he suffered punishment back then. His hatred for Lin Yun was unprecedented.

He spared no efforts to kill Lin Yun and he even went as far as issuing a bounty. So how could he not be happy when Lin Yun finally died?

“No!” Xin Yan cried out. She directly jumped down from the observation platform, which startled everyone.

“Senior Sister Xin Yan!” Mo Cheng and the others were shocked. The observation platform was ten thousand feet high and it wouldn’t feel great if someone in the Profound Martial Realm descended it with a jump.

This scene left everyone shocked. When Guardian Plum saw this scene on a higher platform, his face changed and he shook his head. Only Wang Yan was briefly shocked before he rejoiced inwardly, “I told you that you’ll regret crossing me!”

“Senior Brother Wang, something doesn’t seem right. I remember that Lin Yun carries a sword box with him…” Leng Mo spoke in a soft voice.

“That’s not Lin Yun?” Wang Yan’s face changed. But he soon sneered, “How can he possibly be alive? Do you think that he can kill someone even after being mobbed?”

Even the elders also started to whisper among themselves.

“That doesn’t seem like Lin Yun…”

“Elder Hong, did you manage to see it clearly?”

“It all happened too quickly. I didn’t manage to see it clearly. All I know is that he fell into the sea of flames. But he doesn’t seem like Lin Yun.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“That person looks like Jiang Feng to me…”

Everything happened too quickly, so the disciples couldn’t see it clearly. But the elders were all in the Violet Palace Realm and they could see everything with just a glance. The reason why they thought it was Lin Yun was that they saw four people ganging up on Lin Yun, so they subconsciously thought that Lin Yun was dead.

But they soon felt that something was amiss after they calmed down. At the same time, discussions began to sound out on the observation platform. All of them were discussing if the deceased was Lin Yun. Even Wang Yan couldn’t help but be suspicious. His face changed and the Gentlemen Union’s alliance could feel the surrounding atmosphere become awkward.

They looked at Wang Yan occasionally with fear in their eyes. If that wasn’t Lin Yun, then Wang Yan would’ve rejoiced for nothing. But if it wasn’t Lin Yun, who knew what kind of expression Wang Yan would have.

After Xin Yan jumped down the observation platform, she wiped the blood off her lips and searched for the direction to the Sword Tomb.

“It’s good that she’s fine,” sighed an elder who descended on a Sword Condor.

“Elder, can you lend me your condor?” asked Xin Yan anxiously.

“Go ahead.” The elder merely shook his head with a sigh and lent her his Sword Condor.

“Thank you!” She jumped onto the Sword Condor and charged forward. Tears began to roll down Xin Yan’s cheeks as she muttered, “I shouldn’t have allowed you to participate in the Alliance-Union Battle. Damn it, you promised me that you wouldn’t die!”

On the Sword Condor, Luo Feng let out a breath of relief before he smiled, “Old geezer, have a better look next time if you want to ridicule me.”

“What are you saying?” questioned Bai Ting.

“I’m saying that you’re blind!” retorted Luo Feng.

“Bullshit! That’s clearly Lin Yun. How can he possibly kill someone after being ganged by four people? Do you think I’m stupid?” Bai Ting cursed at Luo Feng. As he spoke, he poured his origin energy into his eyes. But Jiang Feng had already fallen into the sea of flames, so he was already incinerated. How could Bai Ting possibly see who that person was?

Retracting his gaze, Bai Ting turned to Luo Feng. He snorted, “Lin Yun must’ve died. Look, even the battle has stopped. We’ll be able to have a better look once the flames calm down.”

But Luo Feng couldn’t be bothered to argue with Bai Ting. He smiled, “That’s right. We’ll know after taking a look. But I’m afraid that it won’t be the outcome that you want. Hm? What’s that lass doing here?”

A figure was descending on a Sword Condor towards the sea of flames in the Sword Tomb. This sudden scene had caused a huge commotion with the outer disciples who were gathered outside the Sword Tomb.

Li Wuyou exclaimed when he saw this scene and stopped Xin Yan. He asked, “Big Sister Xin Yan, what are you doing?”

“I’m going to retrieve junior brother’s corpse even if he’s dead!” sobbed Xin Yan.

“Senior Sister, Big Brother Lin is fine. The one who died was Jiang Feng,” smiled Li Wuyou bitterly.

“Senior Sister Xin Yan, the one who died really was Jiang Feng.” Lin Qiushan, Lin Yan, and everyone else stepped forward with shock in their eyes. They never expected that the indifferent Bloody Rose would have such a soft side to her.

“The sea of flames is calming down. Senior Sister Xin Yan, look for yourself.”

When the sea of flames calmed down, four figures appeared in everyone’s vision. There was a youth with resilience written on his face standing proudly with a sword box on his back. It was Lin Yun.

“It’s him…” Xin Yan placed her hands on her chest.

“How is this possible?!” Bai Ting nearly fell from the Sword Condor because he was too emotional. Lin Yun was actually still alive and the one who died was Jiang Feng.

“It’s really Lin Yun!”

“He’s actually not dead. He even managed to kill someone! What a monster!”

“Only Bai Lixuan can be compared to him in the Sword Firmament Pavilion.”

“He’s not simple. It’s hard to imagine that he’s only seventeen.” The observation platform burst into an uproar.

Wang Yan’s face was drained of all color and blood. His eyes then flashed with violence and insanity. It was as though he made a decision.

Guardian Plum revealed an appreciative smile. Although the one who died was Jiang Feng, he was emotional when he saw Lin Yun standing there proudly facing three opponents.

“He’s not bad.”

“He’s worth grooming.”

The Sword-Bearing Elders and Hall Masters nodded their heads with appreciation in their eyes. The one that everyone considered a pushover had actually turned the tables around and even killed someone.

Although the battle was covered by a sea of flames, the elders could imagine how shocking the battle must’ve been. The Sword Tomb was only left with four people and all of them were injured.

Lin Yun’s injuries might seem more serious than the three, but Chang Wu, Chu Haoyu, and Ye Xiu all had fear in their eyes when they looked at Lin Yun. Chu Haoyu sheathed his sword with a grave expression.

The four stood on the swords in the Sword Tomb with battle spirit blazing in their eyes. When they circulated the origin energy within their body, the atmosphere in the Sword Tomb became suffocating. No one dared to be careless after Jiang Feng was killed.

Anyone could tell that this was just calm before the storm. Suddenly, an ear-piercing whistle rang out and descended among the four of them. Even the entire Sword Tomb trembled when that object descended. It was an ancient war flag covered in mysterious runes.

“This is…”

The four of them were shocked, but Guardian Plum’s voice soon rang out, “This is a high-grade cosmic artifact, the Scarletflame War Flag. The one who takes the flag wins the Alliance-Union Battle!”

The sea of flames blazed around the war flag and the spiritual runes on it dazzled. At the same time, the four on the Sword Tomb were shocked.

“A cosmic artifact?!” Did that mean the one who obtains the war flag will become the champion? Everyone’s gaze was on the war flag with a deep burning fire in their eyes. They finally lost control of the battle spirit in their hearts.

A sword buzzing noise echoed from the four of them, which caused the swords in the ground to resonate.
