Chapter 1162 - Transformed Lil’ Red

Lil’ Red dove into Lin Yun’s embrace before he could even react. He caressed Lil’ Red’s head, but inwardly he was shocked by Lil’ Red’s speed. It had been a long time since they last met, and Lil’ Red was acting a lot more friendly than usual.

It also didn’t take long for Lil’ Purple to walk over. She was donned in a white dress with adorable braids that jumped while she walked.

“It has been a long time, Lil’ Purple.” Lin Yun smiled while he placed Lil’ Red down.

“Hmph, why would I care about you.” Lil’ Purple sat down before she suddenly exclaimed and looked at Lin Yun with her eyes lit up, “The Azure Dragon Saint Physique! It’s only been half a month, but you actually achieved the Azure Dragon Saint Physique!”

“I had some luck,” smiled Lin Yun. Seeing Lil’ Purple’s curiosity, Lin Yun shared with her about his experience on Heavenly Aquatic Island.

“A mere Lei Ying already placed you in such a position? If I was there, he wouldn’t dare to be arrogant.” Lil’ Purple replied in disdain.

“Hey, are you injured? I can take a look at your injuries if you have any.” Lil’ Purple asked when she was done, concerned that Lin Yun was injured.

But Lin Yun didn’t say a word, removing his clothes and revealing his perfect figure.

“You pervert!” Lil’ Purple covered her face with her hands, but she peaked through her hands.

“What the hell are you thinking about? I devoured the origin stone when I fell unconscious and made a breakthrough, converting all the dragon runes into saint runes.” Lin Yun took in a deep breath before he continued, “The benefits scare me a little. So help me take a look and see if there are any side effects.”

His physique was now comparable to a saint artifact, and he could easily kill an ordinary genius in the Galaxy Stage if he activated the Azure Dragon Mark. However, this was under the condition that he didn’t activate the Azure Dragon Saint Armor. If he did, Lin Yun speculated that he could take ten moves from Lei Ying at the latter’s strongest state.

It was too unbelievable since he was only in the seventh soul Heavenly Soul Realm while Lei Ying was a monster who killed two elders in the Elysium Core Realm. The benefit was too great that it made Lin Yun feel uneasy. After all, there was nothing free in the world, especially since the origin stone was peculiar. In fact, it reeked of an ancient and devilish aura when it was born.

Lil’ Purple removed her hands from her face and said, “Since that’s the case, this empress will take a look for you.”

Lil’ Purple then focused on the Azure Dragon Mark in Lin Yun’s chest briefly before she smiled.

“How is it?” Lin Yun asked.

“It’s true, there’s something weird about the origin stone. It probably wanted to devour you and use you as a fertilizer, but it had no idea that your Azure Dragon Saint Art was something given by the Azure Dragon Lord.” Lil’ Purple mocked. “If you didn’t give me your true bone, you might have been able to manifest a dragon spirit at the end of the Azure Dragon Saint Art. Anyway, it was a great opportunity for you, and you don’t have to worry about any side effects from the origin stone.”

Hearing that, Lin Yun finally felt relieved because he could focus on the Spirit Astral Mountain three days from now.

“What’s Lil’ Red’s current cultivation?” Lin Yun examined Lil’ Red because he couldn’t sense any changes in its aura aside from its fur becoming a lot glossier. If it wasn’t for the fact that it looked a little fat, it might be pretty popular among the girls. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Hmph, Lil’ Red is now in the Galaxy Stage, and its bloodline is even more terrifying than a monarch demonic beast. With the Ancient Dracoape Art, even you might not be able to defeat Lil’ Red. What do you think? Do you want a spar?” Lil’ Purple looked at Lin Yun with a smug on her face.

“Well, I do need to see how strong my physique has become. Let’s go!” Lin Yun smiled. His residence was rather spacious, but it was too small for him to conduct a spar. So he led Lil’ Red and Lil’ Purple to a floating mountain outside the Sword Saint Mountain.

It was a remote place that no one would get close to. Furthermore, it was also the place where Lin Yun used to practice his flute. Looking at Lil’ Red, Lin Yun said, “Let’s test it in the cat form.”

Lil’ Red was terrifyingly fast, and Lin Yun had a deep impression of its speed. But Lin Yun guessed that Lil’ Red must’ve gotten a lot faster now that it had reached the Empyrean Realm.

“Lil’ Red, teach him some lesson. Don’t disappoint me.” Lil’ Purple said with her head raised.

Without any hesitation, Lil’ Red charged over and reached Lin Yun in the blink of an eye. Before Lin Yun could even see where Lil’ Red was, its claws already enveloped Lin Yun.

“Interesting.” Lin Yun circulated the Azure Dragon Saint Art without any hesitation, summoning the dragon runes on the surface of his body. When Lil’ Red’s claws landed on the runes, it only caused a tiny ripple before sending Lil’ Red flying.

Lil’ Red’s current claws could even tear mountains apart, but Lin Yun still deflected the attack. Just like that, Lin Yun and Lil’ Red clashed on the mountain, inflicting destruction on the surroundings.

“Looks like the Azure Dragon Saint Art really isn’t simple.” Lil’ Purple muttered. After all, Lil’ Red’s claws could easily tear apart an overlord demonic beast in the Galaxy Stage. Not even demonic beasts whose body was comparable to profound artifacts could take it head-on.

Lil’ Red’s claws were completely useless against Lin Yun. However, this wasn’t the reason for Lil’ Purple’s shock. She was shocked because Lin Yun’s boundless vitality wasn’t any inferior compared to Lil’ Red!

As Lin Yun circulated the Azure Dragon Saint Art, he summoned both lightning and wind. After all, ancient Azure Dragons were masters of thunderstorms. So their innate talent allowed Lin Yun to wield the wind and lightning intent.

Seeing that Lil’ Red was about to be suppressed, Lil’ Purple smiled, “Lil’ Red, stop messing around and teach him some lesson!”

As Lil’ Red let out a roar, it had transformed into its dracoape form with immense pressure sweeping out. Instantly, it suppressed the phenomenon created by Lin Yun. When it was done transforming, a dracoape of 30 meters appeared before Lin Yun.

“It’s smaller?” Lin Yun was surprised by this scene. After all, Lil’ Red was at least 90 meters tall when it took on the dracoape form in the past. Although it had become smaller, its aura was a lot more condensed.

The pressure from Lil’ Red immediately suffocated Lin Yun. When it threw a punch, it actually created a dragon shaped vortex with terrifying lightning. Lin Yun was caught by surprise and was sent flying.

Lin Yun crashed into a tree, snapping it in half before falling to the ground. But when he fell onto the ground, he activated the Azure Dragon Mark, causing an explosion to blow all the rubble away.

“Again!” Just like that, Lil’ Red and Lin Yun clashed once more, nearly destroying the entire mountain. After 100 moves later, Lin Yun was completely exhausted, “I give up…”

“It hurts.” Lin Yun was hurting despite his physique comparable to a saint artifact. It took him a while before he revealed a smile, “Looks like I won’t be able to fight with Lil’ Red before reaching the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm.”

“Hmph. Don’t feel discouraged. It’s impressive that you can face Lil’ Red for so long relying on your physique.” Lil’ Purple flew over and comforted Lin Yun before she chuckled, “But Lil’ Red didn’t have the genuine Ancient Dracoape Art. The current Ancient Dracoape Art is completed by me that comes with movement technique, staff technique, phenomena, the complete profundities, along with the ancient seal.”

Lin Yun was shocked as he looked at Lil’ Red and exclaimed, “So it’s that powerful?”

“Hmph. Why don’t you look at the person who taught Lil’ Red!” Lil’ Purple said with a smug smile. Lin Yun rolled his eyes because Lil’ Purple had a habit of boasting. Only half of her words could be trusted. No matter what, Lil’ Red had become a lot stronger, but it should also have something to do with the leaf of the Divine Blood Fruit.

“Again!” Lin Yun wasn’t willing to admit defeat, so he challenged Lil’ Red once more. He would soon try to make a breakthrough to the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm, and sparing with Lil’ Red would definitely be the best way to improve his Azure Dragon Saint Physique.

Just like that, three days had passed in the blink of an eye.

At this moment, the entire Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect was clamoring because the opening of the Spirit Astral Mountain was about to happen. Only the four major sects could possess a Spirit Astral Mountain.

The opening of the Spirit Astral Mountain required a large number of resources, and it would greatly benefit any disciple if they entered before the age of thirty. As all the disciples rushed towards the Spirit Astral Mountain, Lin Yun ended his training.
