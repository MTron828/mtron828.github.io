Chapter 1894 - Moon Hanging High In The Sky

When night descended, the moon hung high in the clouds. When Lil’ Purple returned to Indigo Thunder Peak, she heard someone playing the flute. It was Lin Yun, who was playing the Phoenix Heart Song on the roof.Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Upon seeing Lil’ Purple’s return, Lin Yun stowed the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute and leaped down from the roof, and shared his conversation with the Indigo Thunder Peak Master with her.

“The Heavenly Wheel Pagoda?!” Lil’ Purple’s eyes lit up, and she said, “Go on and agree to it.”

“Let’s talk again in the future. So, how was it?” Lin Yun asked.

“It’s naturally not an issue with me making a trip over.” Lil’ Purple smiled.

“It’s not easy to enter the Dao Yang Palace. You’re not boasting, right?” Lin Yun asked.

“You naturally can’t barge into the Dao Yang Palace, but that doesn’t mean you can’t sneak in. There are flaws in the complicated spiritual runes. I’m not boasting, but no one in the Kunlun Realm can be compared to me in regards to spiritual runes,” Lil’ Purple said.

Lin Yun didn’t reply to that declaration. She might be invincible regarding the theory, but practicality was another issue.

“But we can’t move within the Dao Yang Palace, and it’ll be troublesome if we’re found. There are at least three Saint Realm experts there, and we can’t remain there for long,” Lil’ Purple continued.

“So we can lure him out.” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with a cold light. He had already thought of how to deal with Zhang Yue. He took a silver mask from his interspatial bracelet and said, “Let’s get going.”

When Lil’ Purple saw the mask, her eyes lit up, and she jumped up in excitement, “The Silvermoon Mask! I want it! I want it!”

But Lin Yun merely smiled and raised the mask in the air. No matter how Lil’ Purple tried to jump, she couldn't reach it. Ultimately, she began to furiously hammer against Lin Yun.

When Lin Yun put on the mask, his long hair grew to waist length and turned silver. Every strand of hair flickered with radiance, and his hair was smooth. Even his clothes turned silver, basking him in a layer of moonlight that made him seem cold and aloof.

Lin Yun’s transformation entirely stumped Lil’ Purple, but she fancied the Silvermoon Mask, out of all of Lin Yun’s items, the most.

When Lin Yun carried the sword box, he got Lil’ Purple and Lil’ Red to enter the sword box, then left. He used the Divine Tortoise Transformation to conceal his aura. In addition to the Silvermoon Mask, even a Saint wouldn’t be able to notice him if they weren’t attentive enough. His existence was insignificant, like a rock at this moment.

“Lin Yun, this way isn’t to the Dao Yang Palace. Where are you going?” Lil’ Purple asked from the sword box.

The Dao Yang Palace was situated at the foot of the Dao Sword Mountain, and the two palaces were famous within the Heavenly Dao Sect. So how could anyone lose their way to the Dao Yang Palace?

Very quickly, Lil’ Purple knew where Lin Yun was going. He stopped outside the Profound Maiden Courtyard. But after facing the strict guards, Lin Yun easily sneaked into the Profound Maiden Courtyard after a brief observation.

An hour later, after brief scouting, Lin Yun finally found Ye Xinyan’s residence. She was the disciple of the Serene Dust Great Saint, and it wasn’t hard to find her residence. Her residence was brightly lit, and he saw a shadow seated on the ground.

“This should be the place,” Lin Yun muttered, looking at the residence from a tree.

“You’re a scumbag. You looked so devoted to Bai Shuying just a moment ago, and yet you’re going after Profound Maiden Miao Yin now?” Lil’ Purple mocked from the Iris Secret Realm.

But Lin Yun simply ignored her. He was forced to try and flirt with Bai Shuying because his identity would be exposed if he did nothing when he saw Bai Shuying. So he merely flirted with Bai Shuying to maintain his identity, and Lin Yun could sense that Bai Shuying was pretty annoyed with him. This was why he had no reservations, but it was a different story for Ye Xinyan.

Ye Xinyan was his senior sister and the closest person to him in the Profound Amber Realm. Even without mentioning his relationship with Ye Xinyan, he promised Ye Xinjue that he would take care of her. So he wouldn’t allow anyone to harm Ye Xinyan, and Zhang Yue had crossed his bottom line.

Lin Yun took out a jade bottle that contained his prepared Demigod Wine. He briefly glanced at it before sneaking into the courtyard and left the jade bottle on the spiritual array before he came in contact with it.

This commotion naturally alarmed Ye Xinyan and she came out from her residence to see the jade bottle in her hand. But she was cautious and didn’t open it. She was scouting her surroundings first.

“The Demigod Wine is rare, and she might not recognize it,” Lil’ Purple said within the Iris Secret Realm.

“Her master is a Great Saint. So she recognizes it.”

“You might as well tell her directly. Wait… Do you know her?” Lil’ Purple suddenly thought of something and began to gossip.

“She’s my senior sister from the Firmament Sword Pavilion in the Profound Amber Realm.” Lin Yun didn’t explain much and left after he saw Ye Xinyan returning to her residence.

Now that he had done what he wanted, he followed Lil' Purple’s route and sneaked into the Dao Yang Palace. The Dao Yang Palace was at the foot of the mountain, and the security here was higher than at the Profound Maiden Courtyard. Occasionally, Lin Yun could sense a terrifying aura.

Zhang Yue’s residence was built on the requirement of a saint’s disciple. Not only was it grand, but the density of spiritual energy here was also higher. When he entered the residence, he soon found Zhang Yue, and a cold light flashed across his pupils.

“Are you going to kill him? He’s a saint’s disciple.” Lil’ Purple warned after she sensed the murderous intent Lin Yun gave off.

“It’s easy to kill him, but I want him to lose what he cherishes the most!” Lin Yun flicked his finger, and the paper shot through the window under the empowerment of his sword intent.

Zhang Yue naturally sensed this and opened his eyes to grab the paper. He quickly released his senses and jumped through the window. “Who is it?!”

But no one was in the surrounding area. Lin Yun had long left. This made Zhang Yue fall into deep thoughts, and he opened the paper. His breathing became hurried when he read the paper, and his eyes shone even more brightly.

I am incredibly impressed by the heroism you displayed on the daofield today, and I’m grateful for what you said on my behalf. To be honest, Shuying has long taken a fancy to you. I have suppressed my feelings for years, and I’m vexed about that. I hope that we can spend the night together in a place where no one is around…

“Shuying is asking me out?” Zhang Yue rejoiced, his face becoming red because this all felt like a dream. Although it felt impossible, he couldn’t help feeling a flame blazing within his lower abdomen.

“‘I am incredibly impressed by the heroism you displayed on the daofield today, and I’m grateful for what you said on my behalf…’” A smug expression appeared on Zhang Yue’s face as he reread the paper. After all, he outshone Ye Qingtian on the daofield today and stood out when no one could do anything to Ye Qingtian. The more he thought about it, the more he believed what was written on the paper.

“‘I have suppressed my feelings for years…’ Does this mean that Shuying has long taken notice of me?” A faint smile appeared on Zhang Yue’s face, and it seemed that Bai Shuying hated Ye Qingtian. But it was a pity that he couldn’t teach Ye Qingtian a lesson during the day, or Bai Shuying would become even happier. But he had plenty of opportunities to teach Ye Qingtian a lesson in the future.

Holding onto the paper, Zhang Yue’s thoughts wandered around, and he muttered, “Is this a prank? But I’m a saint’s disciple of the Dao Yang Palace, and who dares to prank me? Even if it’s a prank, I’m curious to see who’s that bold to prank me. But if it’s true… Spending the night together…” A lecherous expression appeared on Zhang Yue’s face, and he couldn’t help fantasizing about it with Bai Shuying’s face flashing across his mind. The more he thought about it, the harder it was for him to suppress the flame within his lower abdomen.

“Hehe.” Zhang Yue couldn’t help smiling. He might seem rational, but this came from his self-confidence, and he didn’t believe anyone dared to prank him. He also felt that he was a perfect match for Bai Shuying, and that he must’ve caught Bai Shuying’s attention when he beat up Ye Qingtian in the past.

“Is this a strand of Shuying’s hair? It smells nice…” Zhang Yue wore an intoxicated expression as he held onto the hair left in the paper. When he reopened his eyes, he no longer doubted the content written on the paper. He immediately prepared himself before leaving in a hurry. Before he left, he briefly pondered and retrieved a jade bottle from his residence. This bottle contained a potent ‘vitamin’ that could strengthen his performance.

After retrieving the pellet and briefly observing it, Zhang Yue smiled, “Hehe. I never expected that Senior Sister would be so bold. It looks like I have to do well to satisfy her.”

Stowing the jade bottle, Zhang Yue left the Dao Yang Palace and sped to the location written on the paper. Throughout the trip, he was excited, with joy on his face. When he reached a serene forest, he could hear a resounding piece of flute music.

“Flute music!” Zhang Yue’s eyes lit up because Bai Shuying was proficient in the flute, and she even grasped the Saint Tune. This further confirmed that the one who gave him the letter must be Bai Shuying, and he sped towards the source of the music without any hesitation and came to a towering tree.

The flute music came from the tree. When Zhang Yue stopped, he smiled and yelled, “Senior Sister Bai, I have come as you’ve asked.”

When the flute music stopped, Zhang Yue’s heartbeat increased with anxiety and anticipation.

“Senior Sister Bai? There’s no Senior Sister Bai here.” A cold voice resounded, and a silver figure descended from the tree. This person was donned in a silver robe, enveloped in moonlight, his silver hair draping down to his waist, and he wore a silver mask that made him seem aloof and cold.

“Who are you? Where’s Senior Sister Bai?” Zhang Yue’s face sank, and he began to look around, trying to find Bai Shuying.

Beneath the silver mask, Lin Yun snickered, “‘I hope we can spend the night together in a place where no one is around…’”

“How do you know about that?!” Zhang Yue exclaimed with his face changing. But he soon understood what was going on, and his face sank. “You must be courting death! How dare you fool me!”

Zhang Yue immediately lost control of his emotions and a terrifying aura spread out. His face was terrifyingly dark, and he gritted his teeth, “You have crossed the line!”

He immediately appeared before Lin Yun with his palm directed at the latter’s chest. His speed was fast, but Lin Yun wasn’t sent flying away with that palm.

“A Glory Saint Artifact? Who the hell are you?!” Zhang Yue’s face turned pale, and he took several steps back.

The Glory Saint Artifact that Lin Yun wore was the repaired Myriad Scales Armor. Zhuge Qingyun managed to damage it with his cultivation at the pinnacle of the Quasi-Saint Realm, but how could Zhang Yue possibly damage it with his cultivation that’s only at the third transformation of the Nirvana Stage? Not to mention that Lin Yun had gotten a lot stronger than he was during his fight with Zhuge Qingyun back then.
