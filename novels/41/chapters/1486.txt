Chapter 1487 - You Know

An Liuyan looked surprised, and she couldn’t conceal her shock as she muttered, “This place actually has Lightflow Saint Fruits around. This is unbelievable…”

Everyone near the towering tree turned to look at An Liuyan when they heard what she said. They could no longer turn their gazes away when they saw her. This was because An Liuyan wasn’t just beautiful. Not only was she stunning, she was also bewitching with a voluptuous figure.

When An Liuyan smiled at them, they instantly realized how rude it was for them to stare at her and awkwardly turned their heads away. When they retracted their gazes, a lot of them were reluctant. But some were still peeking at her from the corner of their eyes.

A middle-aged fatty at the six-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm smiled with his eyes squinted, “Lady, your eyesight isn’t bad to instantly recognize the Lightflow Saint Fruit.”

Nodding her head, An Liuyan replied, “The Lightflow Saint Fruits are rare in the outside world and can only be found in low quantities in holy lands. But the maturity of the Lightflow Saint Fruits takes a thousand years. So it’s a scarce saint fruit. Consuming a Lightflow Saint Fruit can increase the saint aura of a cultivator by three hundred. If one consumes it at the Elysium Core Realm, they could increase their cultivation by one star.”

The middle-aged fatty smiled, “That’s indeed the case. But it’s ineffective for those at the six-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm. Even so, it can increase the odds of making a breakthrough, and everyone in the outside world will to try and snatch such a valuable saint fruit!”

Lin Yun was shocked when he heard that. At this moment, he finally knew how terrifying an undiscovered astral realm was. Then again, that also made sense since the other six demonic sects resorted to joining forces against the Heavenly Astral Pavilion.

After all, the demonic sects naturally had conflicts with each other, and the Heavenly Astral Pavilion might not be willing to share the astral realm if it was just two or three demonic sects.

As the middle-aged man glanced at the impressive mounds before An Liuyan, he gulped down a mouthful of saliva before he continued, “Not only the Lightflow Saint Fruits. But I heard that the Frost Lightning Saint Fruit that’s even more precious than the Lightflow Saint Fruit and can be found in the Dragon Burial Valley in this astral realm.”

“Frost Lightning Saint Fruit?” Lin Yun was shocked upon hearing that there was a saint fruit with two attributes, not to mention that it was a rare combination of ice and lightning. If he remembered correctly, the attributes perfectly matched Ye Ziling, who had merged her Divine Dragon Sword Physique and the Radiant Snow Clan’s Bloodline.

The fatty smiled upon seeing everyone’s reaction. Even if he was shocked when he first heard about it, he was already numb to it.

“Ha. So what if there are a lot of saint fruits? It’s practically impossible to obtain one without strength.” A sour voice resounded from amongst the crowd. This was a gorgeous woman, but she paled in comparison to An Liuyan.

After all, An Liuyan instantly stole the limelight with her arrival, naturally making this woman unhappy.

An Liuyan naturally heard the hostility in this woman’s tone, but she only brushed it off with a smile. As for Lin Yun, he acted as though he didn’t understand, so he asked, “Is it that hard to pick the Lightflow Saint Fruits?”

“Ha!” That woman snickered. “Are you a fool? Will so many of us stand here if it could be picked so easily? The Lightflow Saint Fruit isn’t lethal, but it’s extremely fast. It’s faster than wind intent, and as long as something is fast enough, even a strand of hair can kill.”

She raised her head to look at Lin Yun with disdain as she spoke. But she soon wore a playful smile, “You can give it a try, if you don’t believe me.”

“Brother, she’s right.” The middle-aged fatty said. “Not only that. Even if you’re fast enough to avoid the attacks from the tree, the Lightflow Saint Fruit will turn into a streak of light the moment you pick it, and it will dissolve in the air. So you must be faster than it and grab it before it can escape. Furthermore, you can only use a little force because you’ll crush it if you’re not careful with it.”

Lin Yun instantly knew why the fragrance in the air was so strong. It turned out that many Lightflow Saint Fruits were dissolved before he and An Liuyan arrived.

“Look over there!” An Liuyan pointed out.

Lin Yun looked in the direction she pointed at and saw several corpses lying under the towering tree. The state of those corpses was terrifying because some had half of their heads sliced open, and some had their bodies torn apart. Furthermore, the cuts were smooth and clean.

This scene surprised Lin Yun because if he wanted to create such a smooth cut, he would have to resort to the quasi-Heavenly Dome Sword Intent. Furthermore, his opponent couldn’t be too strong, or it would be impossible for him to achieve it.

When his gaze fell onto the only complete corpse on the ground, this man had a leaf embedded in his forehead. It looked as though nothing had happened to him, but this person had long taken his last breath with no signs of vitality. This meant it was that leaf that took the life of this man.

He could tell that this man was strong because there wasn’t much damage to his corpse. But he also couldn’t escape death since the center of the brow was the vital spot for many people.

“These brothers died a miserable death. They’re confident in their speed, and several even reached the fourth grade in their wind intent. It’s such a pity.” The middle-aged fatty sighed while taking a peek at An Liuyan.

“How do I address you?” Lin Yun asked.

“My name is Mo Li, the Seven Absolute Palace’s guest.” The middle-aged fatty smiled. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

No matter how Lin Yun looked at it, that middle-aged fatty didn’t look like one. He was probably a helper recruited by the Seven Absolute Palace, and his identity was similar to Can Jiu and others. Seeing how well-prepared the six demonic sects were, this meant that the news of the astral realm had long been exposed.

Lin Yun initially wanted to give it a try. But he began to hesitate when he saw the corpses on the ground.

“Ha!” The woman looked at An Liuyan, and she snickered, “It looks like your man is nothing impressive, and I was wondering if there was anything special about him. My cousin is the core disciple of the Blood Rain Pavilion, and I can at least obtain a Lightflow Saint Fruit with his help!”

This woman was starting to get on Lin Yun’s nerves. She was jealous of An Liuyan just because the latter was more beautiful. Since she couldn’t compete in beauty, she turned to compete with men. This made Lin Yun shake his head. His relationship with An Liuyan was pure, which wasn’t like what this woman thought. He could only say that this woman probably had nothing better to do.

“Let me give it a try.” An Liuyan smiled.

“You?” Lin Yun was surprised.

“You must be curious about my strength, right? After all, we never fought before.” An Liuyan smiled.

Lin Yun didn’t say a word, but he knew An Liuyan should have a higher cultivation than him. After all, her bewitching technique was so terrifying that even he didn’t dare to be careless despite possessing the firmament sword intent. But it was just as An Liuyan had said. Aside from that, he knew nothing else about her.

“Miss, don’t go for it. This tree is bizarre, and the best way is to wear a full set of saint armor. With the protection of an entire set of saint armor, it can ensure your life even if you fail.” The middle-aged fatty quickly said.

“That’s right. Don’t go for it.” Others also tried to persuade An Liuyan. After all, it was too much of a pity to see a beauty like her lose her life.

“Ha. You only know how to brag.” That woman from the Blood Rain Pavilion snickered, looking at An Liuyan with contempt.

“It’s fine.” An Liuyan motioned Lin Yun to step aside before she stepped forth. Lin Yun didn’t try to stop her because he had never looked down on her once. He could always feel that this woman had a deeply hidden secret. After all, she was the only woman amongst the thirteen envoys, and something was definitely special about her.

Before everyone could exclaim, An Liuyan was like a streak of light as she flew towards the tree. She had a bewitching figure with snow-white skin, and her dress revealed a lot of her skin. So she naturally became a scenic figure for everyone who was on the ground.

But this wasn’t the time for anyone to enjoy the scenery because the tree made a move when An Liuyan had just gotten close to it.

Several leaves fell from the tree and disappeared in the eyes of everyone as they flew toward An Liuyan. This scene made Lin Yun’s heart sink because the leaves' speed exceeded his expectations. He was so startled that he nearly exclaimed.

The audience also exclaimed when they saw this scene with their faces pale. But An Liuyan looked like she was strolling through the storm as she began dancing like a feather. She was dancing with her figure emitting a boundless charm, and her dance instantly captivated the souls of many.

And coincidentally, she dodged all the leaves as she danced. When she spun in mid-air, she bit onto a leaf and smiled as she looked back.

“What beauty!” The middle-aged man was utterly captivated by her beauty.

As An Liuyan spat the leaf out, several pink cloths on her body flew out like a waterfall and picked a Lightflow Saint Fruit. What happened next was just as everyone had said. The moment the fruit left the branch, it turned into a streak of light and tried to escape.

This made An Liuyan look grave as she stepped forth, controlling the cloth in her hand to chase after the Lightflow Saint Fruit. Several branches suddenly lashed out like whips trying to strike her, but An Liuyan easily dodged the attacks with her dance while her cloths collided with those branches.

When a cloth finally reached the Lightflow Saint Fruit and was about to sweep it over, the Lightflow Saint Fruit had already left the range of the tree and instantly dissolved.

“This…”

“What a pity! Just a little more!” The audience members in the surroundings sighed in pity because An Liuyan was so close to obtaining the Lightflow Saint Fruit.

An Liuyan returned and shook her head, giving Lin Yun a wink, “What a pity, I failed.”

“Haha!” That woman from the Blood Rain Pavilion laughed. She was really frightened earlier because she would be embarrassed if An Liuyan managed to retrieve the Lightflow Saint Fruit.

“It’s fine.” Lin Yun smiled. He knew An Liuyan didn’t reveal her true strength, but this also made him see her in a new light. He could tell that the dance wasn’t simple and probably had a huge origin.

“That’s all?” The woman from the Blood Rain Pavilion had her eyes filled with contempt while she sneered, “Your man is really useless. He can’t even be compared to one of my cousin’s fingers.”

“I know better than you whether he’s useless or not. Only useless men would use their fingers, and I believe you know what I mean.” An Liuyan gave that woman a deep smile. ???

An Liuyan’s words instantly drew a wave of laughter from the surroundings. Even the woman from the Blood Rain Pavilion’s face had turned red as she shut her mouth.

The middle-aged fatty patted Lin Yun’s shoulder and laughed, “Brother, your woman is really straightforward!”

But Lin Yun pretended not to hear him as he looked at the tree, “Let me give it a try.”

He managed to discover something, and he now had at least 90% confidence in getting it.
