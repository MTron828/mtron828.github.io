Chapter 2311 - Xiao Chen

When the day arrived, the Astral River Saint Sovereign appeared before Lin Yun on time. Over the past few days, the Astral River Saint Sovereign would appear every morning with gifts. So when Lin Yun saw the Astral River Saint Sovereign, he had a hint of anticipation in his eyes as usual.

Seeing this, the Astral River Saint Sovereign smiled, “There are no gifts today. Even with the Divine Phoenix Mountain’s foundation, we can’t bear giving such a heavy gift on a daily basis.”

Lin Yun looked awkward but soon replied, “You can’t blame me for that. Anyone would look forward to you coming with so many gifts every day.”

“Haha! That’s my fault, then. Let’s go. It's time for you to meet the holy master.” The Astral River Saint Sovereign laughed and they chatted while they left. When they arrived at the main hall, Lin Yun once more saw the Scarlet Radiant Saint Lord with a middle-aged man beside him.

This made Lin Yun briefly stunned. He wasn’t surprised about the Scarlet Radiant Saint Lord’s appearance being here, since he had already guessed that this person had an extraordinary identity. But he was surprised when he saw the middle-aged man, the Sacred Alliance’s Heavenly Lake Saint Lord.

“Heavenly Lake Saint Lord?!” Lin Yun exclaimed.

“Flower Burial, you should address me as the Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign now,” the Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign smiled.

When Lin Yun looked at the Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign carefully, he noticed that this person had become a Saint Sovereign, so he quickly changed his words.

“No worries about it. It’s my honor that you can still remember me,” the Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign smiled.

“Greetings, Holy Master.” The Astral River Saint Sovereign respectfully cupped his fists together at the Scarlet Radiance Saint Lord.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

This left Lin Yun shocked as he looked at the Astral River Saint Sovereign and the Scarlet Radiance Saint Lord before he figured it out. Wearing a smile, he cupped his fists together, “Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple, Lin Yun, greets the Divine Phoenix Holy Master.”

Although he was shocked that the Scarlet Radiance Saint Lord suddenly became the Divine Phoenix Holy Master, he could still accept it, especially after the holy master revealed his Time Dao yesterday. But Lin Yun was still reserved in his speculation and didn’t connect him with the holy master.

“Lin Yun, you won’t blame me for hiding my identity from you, right?” The holy master said as he came over.

Lin Yun smiled, “I don’t dare, and I should’ve guessed it. After all, who else can decide to lend the Sinful Fire Divine Rune?”

The holy master waved his hand for the Astral River Saint Sovereign to leave before explaining everything to Lin Yun with a smile, “I didn’t plan on meeting you at first because I was waiting for the Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign. But I found you by accident and waited since you’re trying to grasp Nirvana Dao.”

“I can vouch for that,” the Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign said.

Lin Yun wasn’t bothered and smiled, “This is nothing. If not for your guidance, I wouldn’t have made such rapid progress over the past few days, not to mention the cultivating resources you gave me.”

Lin Yun realized that the situation was better than he had expected. He initially planned to beg the holy master to help in his master’s tribulation. He was still worried that he couldn’t convince the holy master, but it looked like the holy master needed his help, or he wouldn’t be guiding him for the past few days. He wasn’t hurrying and waited for the holy master to speak first.

The holy master and Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign exchanged a gaze, before he said, “Lin Yun, I won’t beat around the bush with you since we’ve been interacting for the past few days.”

“Holy Master, you can go ahead,” Lin Yun nodded.

The holy master fell silent and didn’t know how to speak since it was a long story.

Seeing this, the Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign smiled, “Holy Master, why don’t we talk about something else first? Lin Yun, do you still remember what I told you before?”

Lin Yun briefly pondered and said, “I have a rough recollection. You said that the Sacred Alliance will look after me in the dark no matter what happens to my master because I’m the champion of a Heavenly Path. The Sacred Alliance also helped when I killed the ten realm sons on the heavenly path.”

“That’s nothing. I’ll be honest with you. The Sacred Alliance helped you because of the potential you displayed, and we have also paid attention to similar geniuses,” the Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign smiled. “You’re first on the five Eastern Desolation’s rankings, and the Sacred Alliance has also set up similar rankings in the other places to observe all the geniuses of the Sacred Alliance. We have a neutral position, and we’re a bunch of people who have continued to pursue the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity after the fall of the Dragon’s Gate. Our objective is to protect the Kunlun Realm and reforge the Heavenly Path.”

Lin Yun was surprised as he looked at the Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign with a hint of seriousness. He once heard about reforging the Heavenly Path from the Azure Dragon Lord, which was why the Azure Dragon Lord gave him the Azure Dragon King Bone and Firmament Saint Cloth.

“What’s the matter?” The Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign asked.

“Someone told me that before,” Lin Yun replied honestly.

The Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign was briefly stunned before his gaze became complicated. A long time later, he sighed, “It’s the Azure Dragon Lord, right? He’s the last sect master of the Dragon’s Gate, and he was the one who severed the Heavenly Path.”

“I promised him when I accepted the Azure Dragon King Bone, and I will do it even if you didn’t ask me to,” Lin Yun said.

The Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign smiled, “It looks like our choices are the same. He chose you a hundred thousand years ago, while I chose you at the end.”

Lin Yun pondered and asked, “What does the Heavenly Path mean to the Kunlun Realm? Why did he sever it back then? He was only a remnant of his soul and didn’t have enough time to tell me about it.”

“That’s a long story, and it’s also time for you to know about it,” the Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign said. He continued, “After the era that the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity belonged to was destroyed, the Kunlun Realm became the center of the world, and the Divine Dragon Era was established. The Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity discovered the existence of the Era Door. The universe has countless eras, and the Era Door can link up the worlds. The universe was much bigger than the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity had imagined.

“At the birth of the Divine Dragon Era, it was dangerous because fiendgods appeared from primal chaos along with invaders, wanting to seize this new era. One must know that the birth of a new era was rare, and the Divine Dragon Era was special and could become a Sovereign World. What happened after that also proved that the Divine Dragon Era accomplished it.

“The ancient time was a grand era with the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity resolving all the fiendgods by himself, slaying countless invaders, and becoming famous in the universe because of it. Almost everyone knew of that white-clothed bladesman. The Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity was previously known as the White-robed Bladesman before he got his title as the Blue Dragon King.”

Lin Yun suddenly recalled the last fight in the Hidden Sword Manor. When the sword within his body nearly broke out, it was suppressed by a white-robed bladesman.

“When that time calmed down, the Blue Dragon King wandered the universe and befriended many people, leaving behind many legends. The name of the Blue Dragon King spread far and wide, with many followers and people admiring him moving to the Divine Dragon Era. At the end of the ancient time, the Blue Dragon King made a grand wish that everyone would pursue their dreams instead of seeking immortality and wouldn’t regret it even if they died!”

This wasn’t the first time Lin Yun heard this, but he could feel his blood boiling every time he heard it.

“After that, the Blue Dragon King experienced nine tribulations and established the Heavenly Path. The Heavenly Path is also the path to becoming a deity. Since then, everyone in the Kunlun Realm rose with a chance to reach the Deity Realm. One must know that before that, only Sovereign Worlds and ancient divine palaces could give birth to a deity, but the Blue Dragon King did all of that himself. At that time, the Blue Dragon King’s reputation reached a new height, reaching the Ancestral Realm. He spread his teachings and didn’t differentiate lives from their birth. Everyone can try reaching the Deity Realm in the Divine Dragon Empire if they work hard.”

Lin Yun said, “That means that the existence of the Heavenly Path allowed people to reach the Deity Realm in the Kunlun Realm. But after the Heavenly Path was severed, no one could reach the Deity Realm anymore in the Kunlun Realm?”

The Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign nodded and continued, “Since the birth of the Heavenly Path, the Kunlun Realm suffered multiple invasions and battles between deities. But the Blue Dragon King was a force, not to mention that the Kunlun Realm would have reinforcements from the other eras. Many forces came to help because of the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity’s grand wish.

“We have been winning. We won multiple times, with the Kunlun Realm’s reputation rising. But we lost in the last battle with many deities falling. Even if some were still alive, they were forced to leave the Kunlun Realm. As a result, the Azure Dragon Lord had no choice but to sever the Heavenly Path and close the Era Door to prevent anyone from entering the Kunlun Realm, severing the path to become a deity as well.”

After Lin Yun heard the story, he asked, “Where’s the Blue Dragon King?”

“As the master of this era, the Blue Dragon King couldn’t interfere in the battle amongst deities. We don’t know much about the ancestral deity but we do know that he left for the dangerous Nether Realm for a friend and the future of the Kunlun Realm, suppressed by the Divine Fate Palace in the Nether Realm. He wants to escape fate, but only the Iris Sword Saint would know of his exact plan and not us.”

Lin Yun’s voice trembled as he asked, “Can I ask the name of this Blue Dragon King?”

The Heavenly Lake Saint Sovereign was surprised because he didn’t know why Lin Yun asked this question.

The Divine Phoenix Holy Master said, “Let me reveal it. Not many people mention the ancestral deity’s name, but it’s not a secret. His name is Xiao Chen.”
