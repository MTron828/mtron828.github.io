Chapter 1976 - I Know You

When reality overlapped with what was in his mind, Lin Yun involuntarily blurted out, “Senior Sister!”

Xin Yan looked at Lin Yun weirdly before she smiled, “What’s the matter? Am I not worthy of becoming your ‘Senior Sister’ now that you’ve been accepted as the Dragon Origin Great Saint’s secluded disciple? According to the seniority within the sect, you also have to address me as ‘Senior Sister’!”

She heard Ye Qingtian was cocky and arrogant, especially when he returned. He even dared to slap a Saint Elder; one could tell how cocky he had become. So she thought that he wasn’t willing to call her ‘Senior Sister’.

Lin Yun came to his senses and quickly explained, “Absolutely not. If the Profound Maiden is willing, I can call you ‘Senior Sister’ for the rest of my life.”

“Oh?” Bai Xiao and Xin Yan were both surprised. Since when was Ye Qingtian so polite to someone, especially looking so anxious?

Bai Xiao asked, “Why is the Profound Maiden here? According to the rules, you can’t approach any further because the Remorse Cliff is also considered a forbidden ground.”

Xin Yan smiled and took out the Saint Dragon Pellet. She said, “My master was afraid he might be injured and asked me to deliver a pellet. So, please hand this to Junior Brother Ye.”

Bai Xiao’s heart jumped when he heard about the Saint Dragon Pellet. It was rumored that it could save the life of anyone beneath the Saint Realm. If one refined it well, they could even glimpse the saint dragon. This was the same pellet Zhang Yue took when Lin Yun crippled him. Even a Saint wouldn’t have many of them, thus making it rare.

But Bai Xiao was shocked because he had no idea why the Serene Dust Great Saint would give something so precious to Ye Qingtian, and she even got the Profound Maiden to deliver it. Wasn’t she a little too good to Ye Qingtian?

Ultimately, Bai Xiao suppressed the question within his heart and handed the Saint Dragon Pellet to Ye Qingtian.

Lin Yun received the bottle with his face changing. He had roughly guessed the reason, and the Serene Dust Great Saint must’ve known his identity. It should’ve probably been told to her by the Dragon Origin Great Saint. He cupped his hands and said, “I’ll accept this Saint Dragon Pellet. Please express my gratitude to the Serene Dust Great Saint on my behalf.”

Lin Yun had restrained his thoughts after coming to his senses, and he wasn’t even willing to take another glance at her.

This baffled Xin Yan because Ye Qingtian didn’t seem like the rumors. She said, “My master told me that you don’t have to worry while your at Remorse Cliff. The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint wouldn’t dare to do anything to you with her around.”

Bai Xiao turned to look at Ye Qingtian weirdly. He had no idea when Ye Qingtian became so close to the Serene Dust Great Saint. After all, the latter was well-known for being overprotective.

Lin Yun expressed his gratitude again and felt that the relationship between his master’s lovers was a little weird.

“Ye Qingtian, do you have anything you want me to tell my master?” Xin Yan asked. She glanced at Bai Xiao before she continued, “If you suffered any grievances, you can tell me, and my master will seek justice for you.”

Her words made Bai Xiao’s face change as he uneasily looked at Ye Qingtian. The Serene Dust Great Saint was known for having a fiery temper and being overprotective. If Ye Qingtian really said something, he wouldn’t doubt that the Serene Dust Great Saint would fight the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint the next second. If a fight between the two Great Saints breaks out, it would definitely cause a massive din within the Heavenly Dao Sect. So this was why he became uneasy.

“Nothing. I was the one who intruded on the forbidden ground first, and the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint did nothing wrong,” Lin Yun said. He already realized that the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint’s palm was equivalent to saving him. As for confining him at Remorse Cliff, it was equivalent to giving him a gentle slap on the wrist.

“Okay,” Xin Yan smiled and left.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

When Lin Yun looked at Xin Yan’s leaving figure, he couldn’t step forth and felt heartache. He knew he couldn’t disclose his identity because it would bring trouble to Xin Yan if anyone knew he was Lin Yun.

Beside Lin Yun, Bai Xiao heaved a sigh of relief and smiled, “Brother Ye, thanks.”

“Why are you thanking me?” Lin Yun asked.

“If you had said anything else, the Serene Dust Great Saint would knock on the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint’s door within half a day,” Bai Xiao smiled wryly. “They would probably fight, and half of the Nether Orchid Courtyard might be dismantled.”

“It’s that serious?” Lin Yun asked in shock.

Bai Xiao nodded, “Regardless of whether it’s the Serene Dust Great Saint or Heavenly Jade Sword Saint, neither of them have a good temper. They might restrain themselves if it was someone else, but it would be unimaginable if they faced each other.”

Lin Yun couldn’t help feeling speechless because those two weren’t something as simple as being love rivals.

“Big Brother Bai, how long must I be confined here?” Lin Yun asked after recollecting himself.

“I’m not sure about that,” Bai Xiao replied with a frown. “Most people will stay from seven days to three months in Remorse Cliff, but the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said nothing about you.”

“What did Martial Aunt say?”

“She said ‘till the Dragon Origin Great Saint returns’.”

“That means I can’t leave this place until my master returns? Unless Martial Aunt releases me?”

“That’s right.”

Lin Yun quickly knew his current situation. His punishment wasn’t severe, but he didn’t know when the Dragon Origin Great Saint would return. He didn’t even know where his master went. He asked, “Will you stop me if I want to leave?”

“I won’t, and you can try leaving if you want,” Bai Xiao smiled.

Lin Yun sent a doubtful look at Bai Xiao before he stepped forth. But whenever he stepped out, he could feel an obstruction stopping him. When he reached out, Nether Orchids bloomed around the surrounding air, releasing a powerful lifeforce. Under the powerful life force, Lin Yun could sense his nirvana aura sinking into the ocean.

He even tried using his sword intent, but he could do nothing about it. He muttered, “Life Intent.”

“This is the Nether Orchid Sword Array, personally set up by the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint. Even a Saint can’t escape,” Bai Xiao said in a playful tone.

“This array isn’t that profound. I can easily break it if I wanted to,” Lil’ Purple’s voice resounded from the Iris Secret Realm.

Her words immediately gave Lin Yun confidence. Just when he was going to turn around, a figure ran up the mountain and yelled, “Ye Qingtian!”

Lin Yun turned around and smiled when he saw Wang Yue, “What are you doing here?”

“Brother Bai, I have some words to say to him privately.” Wang Yue turned to look at Bai Xiao.

“It’s fine,” Bai Xiao smiled. “But you can’t go any further.”

“Thank you,” Wang Yue said. He naturally knew about the Nether Orchid Sword Array. After Bai Xiao left, Wang Yue smiled wryly, “Ye Qingtian, as expected of you. I’ve been looking for you for half a month, and you actually ran to the Celestial Pool. It’s no wonder why I couldn’t find you!”

“Why were you looking for me?” Lin Yun asked curiously.

“There are rumors that the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint chased you out. Ye Qinghong and the others are also searching for you. A few others and I are worried about you because of that. Aren’t we friends?” Wang Yue replied.

Lin Yun couldn’t help feeling awkward after hearing that. After all, he would also be worried if he was in Wang Yue’s position. But the term ‘friends’ made Lin Yun feel extravagant, especially since he wasn’t Ye Qingtian.

But Wang Yue’s words made him feel a warmth within his heart. He said, “Thank you. The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint brought me away to guide me in a sword technique.”

“I knew it! I knew that it was not what Ye Qinghong said!” Wang Yue said excitedly.

Lin Yun merely smiled awkwardly because he didn’t know how to reply.

“There are rumors that you’re either dead or crippled. I’m relieved to see you alright,” Wang Yue said.

“What about Ye Qinghong’s group? They probably want me dead,” Lin Yun wore a playful smile.

“Oh, there’s something else I’m here to tell you about, and this is why I asked Bai Xiao to give us some space,” Wang Xue said as he nodded.

“What is it?” Lin Yun asked.

“The Divine Dao Pavilion’s Young Master Wushuang will be here in half a month. According to what I know, the Bai Clan is satisfied with him, and they’re giving the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden pressure,” Wang Yue said and looked deeply at Lin Yun, trying to see any changes on Lin Yun’s face.

“What has it got to do with me, then?” Lin Yun asked.

“Stop pretending. Everyone in the Heavenly Dao Sect knows you’re infatuated with the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden. Otherwise, why would you intrude on the Celestial Pool?” Wang Yue smiled.

Lin Yun opened his mouth, but didn’t know how to refute those words.

Wang Yue’s face held a wisp of respect as he said, “Others might not know you, but I know you well. You previously said there’s nothing wrong with falling in love with someone. Isn’t it just intruding on the forbidden ground? So what if you intrude on the forbidden ground for someone you love?”

Wang Yue continued to shake his head as he recited, “‘People laugh at me for being insane, and I laugh at them for being unable to see through me!’ Ye Qingtian, I know you!”

Lin Yun was placed in an even more awkward position than before, and he said, “You might have misunderstood my meaning!”

“Isn’t that what you said?” Wang Yue asked.

“That’s what I said, but…” Lin Yun tried to explain.

But he was interrupted by Wang Yue with a smile, “Ye Qingtian, are you still going to put on an act?”

“I’m not acting at all!” Lin Yun explained.

“Others don’t know how infatuated you are, but I know you well. You’re a sword fanatic and a love fanatic!” Wang Yue said.

Lin Yun’s face became bitter when he heard that.

“Don’t tell me that you’re not concerned about it. If you don’t show up half a month from now, I’ll look down on you!” Wang Yue said righteously.

Lin Yun was dumbfounded because he knew that Wang Yue had significantly misunderstood. He could only change the topic, “Since you’re here, I’ll also tell you that I’m the one who created the Sword of the Beginning. I can teach you now if you want to learn it.”

“This again? Don’t try to change the topic. You have to come no matter what, half a month from now!” Wang Yue smiled and left without giving Lin Yun a chance to respond. He was confident he didn’t find the wrong person, and Ye Qingtian was alive. He didn’t seem to be injured by the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint.

He wasn’t worried that Ye Qingtian couldn’t come. If Ye Qingtian wanted, he could figure out a way to leave. After all, he dared to intrude on the Celestial Pool, so how could Remorse Cliff trap him?

On the other hand, Lin Yun’s gaze was complicated as he looked at Wang Yue’s figure.
