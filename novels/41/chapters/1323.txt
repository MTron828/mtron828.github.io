Chapter 1324 - Luo Hua

The woman who appeared was naturally Luo Hua, and this made the faces of Lei Jue and Xuan Ying, who wanted to help, sink. They were horrified to discover that the regions enveloped by the music became as extremely terrifying as primitive chaos, and the combination of the flute and zither music had painted a gorgeous painting.

The disciples and elders of the Profound Sky Sect were trapped in the painting while the two of them were outside the painting. The power contained in the music was already terrifying, and if they forcibly tore it apart, this would only make the energy contained within become even more terrifying. If there was a chance for everyone who was trapped within, then the two outside could possibly die if they got involved with it.

“How did things develop in this manner…?” Lei Jue and Xuan Ying’s faces were ugly after being caught unexpectedly by this. The two of them were strong, and not even the eight Greater Elysium Core Realm experts could be compared to the two of them. It was so much so that the astral energies in their bodies were shining like bright stars.

“Who’s that person? She seems to be even more beautiful than the girls from the Heavenly Note Sect. How unbelievable…”

“I bet this is what ‘peerless beauty’ means.” Luo Hua’s appearance instantly captivated everyone’s attention, especially when she was playing the zither. This made her temperament even more ethereal, and this also made her look like a perfect match for Lin Yun.

Everything only took place in the blink of an eye. Right at this moment, Lin Yun’s flute music began to change and sounded desolate. The zither music perfectly matched it, and this made Lin Yun smile. He was executing the Dustlight Sword Art through his music, and the two had a great rapport since they had played music together multiple times back in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect.

Under the combination of the zither and flute, the intent behind the Dustlight Sword Art changed and reached an unprecedented height. This also enveloped the surroundings in the intent of the Dustlight Sword Art, and this made those from the Profound Sky Sect who were trapped in the painting scream out in pain.

“You’re courting death!” Lei Jue and Xuan Ying locked their brows together while they swept their gazes at Lin Yun and Luo Hua. They wanted to launch their attacks on Lin Yun and Luo Hua to rescue their people, but they couldn’t find a loophole in the music. This made their hearts sink because the white-clothed woman was clearly a transcendent genius who wasn’t any weaker than Lin Yun.

But before the two of them could come to a decision, Lin Yun’s music changed and became hot-blooded. Whenever the music changed, someone in the painting would be heavily injured, and it didn’t take long for all the Elysium Core Realm experts to be covered in blood and sent flying out of the painting.

“Let’s go!” The faces of Lei Jue and Xuan Ying had turned black. They decided to make a move to destroy that entire region by force. Boundless sacred light exploded from their bodies. They didn’t summon their constellations, merely emitted their auras.

It didn’t take long for the mountain range within a thousand miles to start collapsing under their auras. But that wasn’t all, cracking sounds came from the sky, and two layers of the thirty-six layers of heaven have shattered. This made everyone shocked, but they soon understood what Lei Jue and Xuan Ying were trying to do.

Lei Jue and Xuan Ying wanted to break the music by force. If they managed to accomplish that, not only could they heavily injure Lin Yun and Luo Hua through the backlash, but they could also save those men who were trapped in the music.

But it was already too late. The music began to surge like violent waves, instantly reaching an unprecedented height. As Lin Yun and Luo Hua exchanged a glance, boundless light emitted from the two of them, and their hairs began to flutter in the wind like two waterfalls.

Their hearts were connected at this moment. As countless crystal flowers flew from their bodies, their music manifested into fine threads that connected the crystal flowers. When the flowers bloomed, they emitted a dazzling light under the immense pressure of the shattering sounds.

In that split second, the entire world fell into silence, and the shattering sounds of heaven also stopped. The world was only left with the resounding music of the flute and zither. As for the Profound Sky Sect’s experts who were trapped in the painting, they were all sent flying away. Aside from the three Greater Elysium Core realm experts, everyone was torn into pieces even, if after they had protected themselves with their astral energy.

Lei Jue and Xuan Ying were also caught by surprise as they threw out mouthfuls of blood while taking several steps back. They wanted to use the shattering of the heavens to suppress Lin Yun and Luo Hua and make them suffer the backlash. But not only did they fail, the shattering sounds of the heavens that they created were suppressed, instead. So they suffered pretty badly from this, and this made their faces dark.

“Leave!” Lei Jue and Xuan Ying looked around before they swiftly left with the three Greater Elysium Core Realm experts upon sensing that more forces had started to gather. Lei Jue couldn’t take this lying down, so he glared at Lin Yun before he left, “Lin Yun, just you wait! Since you dared to appear, there’s no way you can leave the Profound Wither Island alive! The Profound Sky Sect won’t let you go!”

Everyone watched as Lei Jue and Xuan Ying fled. If it wasn’t for the blood on the ground that told them that everything was real, everyone there would’ve felt like they were dreaming. When they recovered from their shock, everyone’s gaze was fixed on Luo Hua.

When Lin Yun and Luo Hua gradually approached each other, they were like a perfect couple that even made Jiang Lichen stumped with envy in his eyes. If he could have such a beauty beside him, what else could he wish for?

“She’s the one who’s been resisting the attacks from the eight big sects with her zither music, right?” Qin Tian looked at Luo Hua with shock. Aside from a monstrous genius like Lin Yun, he couldn’t believe that someone like her was also in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect.

“Ye Ziling is out…” Zhang Ting suddenly saw three people walking out from the Silversnow Valley. It was Ye Ziling, who had refined the origin saint rune with Liu Qingyan and Feng Zhang following beside her. But his gaze was on Ye Ziling, and his face drastically changed after a brief moment.

Ye Ziling was enveloped in snowflakes and sacred light. After she made her breakthrough into the Elysium Core Realm, her temperament had undergone a drastic transformation. She was gorgeous when she stood on the snowy mountain. But that wasn’t the main reason why Zhang Ting was shocked. He could sense that the aura that she was giving off wasn’t any weaker than Lei Jue and Xuan Ying.

He couldn’t believe that the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect would give birth to three fated transcendents, and this made him feel unreal.

“Junior Sister!” Jiang Lichen’s face changed when he saw Ye Ziling and quickly rushed over.

“Junior Sister, Junior Brother Lin is Flower Burial!” Jiang Lichen had excitement flickering in his pupils while looking at Ye Ziling, who was blankly staring at Lin Yun. This immediately made Ye Ziling’s facial expression change when she heard what Jiang Lichen said.

“What did you say?” Ye Ziling asked with her brows locked together.

“It’s true!” Jiang Lichen replied. “There is news from the powerful sects. It turns out that Flower Burial is the champion of the Heavenly Path, someone who slew five realm sons. The main goal of the eight big sects was to lure Flower Burial out!”

Ye Ziling’s face thoroughly changed when she heard that. She knew that Lin Yun was the champion of the Ninth Heavenly Path, but she had never linked him up with Flower Burial. According to her speculation, Flower Burial should be from a saint clan and not from a lower plane.

In addition to the fact that the two of them didn’t have that good of a relationship in the beginning, she never thought of the possibility that Lin Yun would be Flower Burial. But now that she thought about it again, everything made sense. Lin Yun was the champion of the Ninth Heavenly Path who slew five realm sons, and he was also the Flower Burial who killed with his flute back on the full moon.

Upon realizing that, Ye Ziling could only feel helpless, and her feelings were complicated.

“Wait, what does Flower Burial have to do with Junior Brother Lin Yun?” Feng Zhang was confused.

“I personally saw him put the mask on and transform into Flower Burial. What do you think? He’ll probably remove his mask later, so just watch.” Jiang Lichen smiled bitterly.

When Lin Yun and Luo Hua came together in mid-air, he took off his mask. When he removed the Silver Moon Mask, his transformation disappeared, and he turned back to Lin Yun.

When Feng Zhang and Liu Qingyan saw this scene, they were both greatly shocked because Flower Burial really turned out to be their Junior Brother Lin Yun.

“Luo Hua, can I take off your veil?” Lin Yun asked.

“Are you still going to call me Luo Hua?” Luo Hua smiled unhappily.

Wearing a smile, Lin Yun stepped forth and held onto the white veil covering Luo Hua. This instantly made them the center of everyone’s focus. Everyone could feel their hearts beating wildly because they were all curious about what kind of beauty this woman was.

“Is Lady Luo going to unmask herself as well?” Jiang Lichen gulped down a mouthful of saliva and could feel his heart beating wildly.

When Lin Yun held onto the white veil, he took a deep breath. He had been waiting for this day for a long time. But when this moment really came, he still couldn’t contain the emotions in his heart.
