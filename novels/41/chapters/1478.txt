Chapter 1479 - Cultivating On The Saint Mountain (2)

Just like that, Lin Yun spent the next month cultivating in this peach blossom forest. He would practice his sword technique during the day and cultivation technique at night. Occasionally, he would play the flute, trying to fuse the Aquaheaven Sword Technique into his music.

Heaven, Earth, Profound, Desolation, Wind, Fire, Lightning, and Ice. The Heaven Sword Form was inferior to low-grade ghost spirit martial techniques. As for the second sword form, Lin Yun was looking toward it.

The Heaven Sword Form had thirty-six strokes, and the Earth Sword Form had seventy-two strokes. The number of strokes was twice the amount of the Heaven Sword Form, but it was relatively easy when he started practicing it.

Lin Yun finally got a knack for it after reaching the manifestation stage with the Heaven Sword Form. Not to mention Lin Yun’s sword intent had reached the quasi-fifth grade sword intent.

While Lin Yun used his sword as a brush in the peach blossom forest, his sword rays looked like black ink that stayed in the air for a long time. Compared to the majestic Heaven Sword Form, the Earth Sword Form was more mysterious, and every single sword ray made the surrounding air heavy.

“What’s going on?” Lin Yun was shocked after he brought the Earth Sword Form to greater mastery.

“That’s gravity.” The Radiant Sword Saint appeared and picked up a tree branch. He then executed this sword technique using a tree branch.

When a brush streaked across, Lin Yun furrowed his brows because the surrounding space became heavy like a quagmire. Lin Yun’s face changed, before he immediately tried to escape.

But when the Radiant Sword Sect flicked his wrist, several sword rays flashed, and Lin Yun could sense his movements becoming slower and slower. His legs were heavy and felt like lead, making it difficult for him to move.

He tried to soar to the sky, but he was soon pulled back onto the ground by gravity. When his body hit the ground, he threw out a mouthful of blood and his face was turning pale. Eight thousand dragon runes roamed across his body as he used his full strength to support himself off the ground before he barely managed to push himself up.

If it was someone else, they would be on the ground and couldn’t even get up on their feet. In worst cases, they might have been turned into a pool of blood.

This was simply too terrifying. When Lin Yun managed to push himself from the ground with the dragon runes, the Golden Crow Wings unfolded behind him. Although Lin Yun managed to rise high into the sky, his falling speed was even faster.

When the Radiant Sword Saint executed the seventy-second stroke, an ancient ‘Earth’ word glowed brightly behind him. This immediately tore Lin Yun’s Golden Crow Wings apart. When he fell to the ground, his bones were creaking and were on the verge of collapse.

“Master, I can’t hold it any longer!” Lin Yun was in great pain as he sank to the ground under the increased gravity.

“How can you bear if you only think of running? Hold your sword and rise again!” The Radiant Sword Saint’s voice resounded once more with a hint of chill in his tone.

Lin Yun got up on his feet in disappointment. He never expected that the Earth Sword Form would be so powerful and his master would be so terrifying. Even if his master had suppressed his cultivation to the Elysium Core Realm, he had no chance. What’s more, his will had collapsed too quickly; he didn’t think of it as a duel between two swordsmen when he fought his master.

“You first. Use the Earth Sword Form!” The Radiant Sword Saint said lightly.

This time, Lin Yun took the initiative while the Radiant Sword Saint defended with a tree branch. Under their sword rays that looked like ink, Lin Yun gradually became more proficient with the Earth Sword Form. After all, the Radiant Sword Saint gave him pointers on purpose.

The Radiant Sword Saint might seem to be fighting Lin Yun, but he was displaying the profundities of the Earth Sword Form to him.

Four hours later, the two thrust their swords as an ancient ‘earth’ word formed at their tips. The flowers on the peach blossom trees were blown away with a loud collision, leaving behind bald branches.

But that wasn’t all, they had both raised their left hand as if they had talked about it beforehand, and a ‘heaven’ word appeared in them. It looked as though there were like two layers of heaven rising from their palms that flew towards each other.

The next moment, the sky began to rotate, and Lin Yun was sent a hundred meters back. But even when he was sent flying back, his eyes were bright even when he dropped to one knee. “Thank you, Master!”

As the Radiant Sword Saint stood with his hands behind his back, he smiled. “Master can only guide you this far. You have to depend on yourself to master it. There are many profundities in this sword technique. If you can reach the minuscule stage, it will be even stronger than high-grade ghost spirit sword techniques. Remember that heaven and earth aren’t alone. You have to think more about it later!”

“I will keep Master’s words in mind!” Lin Yun bowed.

“Get up.”

Ten days later, Lin Yun, sitting in the peach blossom forest, opened his eyes and breathed out a mouthful of air. As a burst of light exploded from his body, a star was condensed in his violet palace.

The Saint Mountain was a lot better than the outside world. Lin Yun had only cultivated for a month and had already made a breakthrough to the three-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Lin Yun felt reluctant when he thought he would leave soon. However, he knew that he had no choice but to go. After all, his master had to be in seclusion, not to mention that the five years were a heavy weight crashing down on his heart.

He really hoped that his master could make it through this ordeal and make a breakthrough, reaching a level comparable to the Emperors.

After he got up, he strolled through the peach blossom forest. When he went into the forest depths, Lin Yun quietly stood behind his master.

“You’re about to leave?” The Radiant Sword Saint looked at Lin Yun with a smile.

“Yeah.” Lin Yun nodded with a heavy heart.

“Do you know why it’s so hard to cultivate the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra?” The Radiant Sword Saint asked.

“That’s because the Nether Sea was shattered in the battle amongst the gods, and there are no other places where you can absorb nether energy in the world.” Lin Yun said truthfully. His martial uncle, the junior brother of his master, told him this.

“Looks like my junior brother told you everything.” The Radiant Sword Saint smiled. “There’s no need for you to head to the Nether Palace this time. Before you leave, I have a gift for you as your master.”

Before Lin Yun could understand what his master was talking about, the Radiant Sword Saint’s finger tapped on Lin Yun’s forehead.

As boundless nether energy surged into his body through the Radiant Sword Saint’s finger, the nether energy swiftly surged towards the Netherflower in his violet palace.

When the light shone brightly from the Nether Sword Seed, it started to violently devour the nether energy.

Lin Yun’s heart tremble because he knew his master was trying to help him break open the Nether Sword Seed.
