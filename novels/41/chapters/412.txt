Chapter 413 - Calming Down

Qin Yu threw up a mouthful of blood that dyed the snow red. However, once he threw up the blood, his complexion improved. Looking at Lin Yun’s silhouette, Qin Yu’s face became ugly.

Lin Yun carried Xin Yan through the snow and walked towards the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s party. The spectators were filled with emotion when they saw this scene. This incident nearly caused a war, but it ultimately had a fairy tale happy ending.

When the youth had appeared in the snow earlier, everyone thought he would die. But not only was Lin Yun still alive, he even brought Xin Yan away with him in a princess carry under the crown prince’s eyes.

“This Lin Yun is truly formidable. We all thought that he became a cripple, but he surprised us all with such a huge commotion.”

“He came with the preparation to die and it paid off.”

“Thinking about what just happened, doesn’t it make your blood boil? This young man is really courageous and admirable.”

“Haha, didn’t you guys see how His Highness threw up blood? As one of the eight titles and the heir to the empire, he actually had his bride-to-be carried away by another man in public.”

“I have to give him props. If it were me, I wouldn’t just be throwing up blood.”

“Speaking of which, the Dragon Gate Competition is one month from now. I bet it’ll be interesting. I have a feeling that the enmity between Lin Yun and Bai Lixuan won’t end today and that there will be another clash.” The youth’s frail silhouette looked majestic in everyone’s eyes.

After today, Lin Yun’s name will surely spread throughout the Great Qin Empire. Stories of his unyielding courage will spread because he drew his sword for a girl and never gave in. Once upon a time, everyone was young. So, many people felt emotional when they saw how he carried Xin Yan away.

As for the Dragon Gate Competition, there was naturally nothing that could be said about it. With the strength that Lin Yun displayed today, he was completely qualified to participate in it. So much so that he even had a chance to become one of the eight titles. After all, Drifting Goblet wasn’t participating in this Dragon Gate Competition, so there was one quota available for everyone to compete for.

“Your Highness, do you have anything else to say?” Guardian Plum undid the seal within Xin Yan’s body when Lin Yun arrived and everyone finally felt relieved.

Recovering his composure, Qin Yu jumped down from the carriage and he helped Bai Lixuan up from the ground. He comforted him saying, “You don’t have to blame yourself for this.”

“Thank you,” replied Bai Lixuan. His failure this time was a great blow to him. He wasn’t embarrassed by his failure, but he couldn’t accept that he lost to Lin Yin in the same manner again.

Perhaps he was a little too confident. He could probably kill Lin Yun had he used his palm and not his sword earlier, but it was a pity that it was too late to regret things. He naturally had to pay a price for his arrogance. The Saint Physique wasn’t invincible and it only represented boundless possibilities for his future.

Qin Yu nodded his head. He wiped the blood off his lips and looked at Guardian Plum, “I have nothing to say. A loss is a loss. I won’t go against my words since I have already given my promise.”

Qin Yu was able to recover his composure despite being placed in such a position. It made others feel as if he hadn’t lost yet.

“But I won’t forget the matter today. I look forward to you guys sending Lin Yun out for the Dragon Gate Competition,” said Qin Yu with the corner of his lips rising up. He took a deep glance at Lin Yun, and he waved his hand, “Let’s go.”

Qin Yu soon left with his group, but the spectators stuck around. All of their eyes were glued to Lin Yun. They had witnessed Lin Yun’s resilience and passion through this battle. Even if Lin Yun had crippled one of his profound veins, he was still powerful. So much so that he couldn’t be underestimated.

The smile that Qin Yu revealed earlier meant that this matter wasn’t finished and that it would be resolved in the Dragon Gate Competition. It was fine if Lin Yun didn’t compete in it. But if he did, then Qin Yu would definitely try to kill him. At that time, he would officially slay Lin Yun as the Flying Feather.

Bai Lixuan cupped his hands at Guardian Plum and left. But when the mysterious man beside Lin Yun was about to leave, Lin Yun called out to him, “May I know who you are? I will definitely repay you for the favor today.”

The mysterious masked man turned around and smiled, “Lin Yun, who do you think I am?”

Drifting Goblet! Lin Yun instantly recognized him the moment he stopped changing his voice. This meant that his long hair must be a wig. It also made sense now as to why he would wear a mask. He must have concealed his identity so he wouldn’t bring any troubles to the Heavenly Profound Sect.

After all, Drifting Goblet had no choice but to be cautious when standing against the crown prince. However, it was possible that the crown prince already recognized Drifting Goblet from his punch.

“Your Highness, thank you for your assistance,” Guardian Plum stood up and thanked Bloomphoenix Princess on behalf of the Sword Firmament Pavilion.

“There’s no need to thank me. After all, I will need help from the Sword Firmament Pavilion in the future. Furthermore, Xin Yan and I can be considered acquaintances.” The Bloomphoenix Princess’ words were calm and no one could guess what she was thinking with the veil covering her face.

When she turned to Lin Yun, her gaze looked complicated, but at the same time, she looked concerned. A long time later, a hint of disappointment flashed in her eyes. In the end, she said nothing to him.

“Let’s return,” declared the princess.

“It looks like Her Highness has a deep impression of you,” said Xin Yan.

Lin Yun seemed to have grasped something from the princess’ gaze, but he didn’t manage to hold onto it. Suddenly, he turned to Xin Yan and replied, “Big Sister, can you discuss with me next time if you’re going to make any decision? It’s not just me, but there are many people concerned for you.”

“Senior Sister Xin Yan!” The Locket Mountain’s disciples all rushed over with joy on their faces.

When Xin Yan saw their familiar faces, her eyes became wet. But she held back her tears by biting her lips.

“Let’s go. It’s time for us to return as well,” smiled Guardian Plum. When he turned to Lin Yun, his smile disappeared, “As for you, tell me what you are doing here instead of hunting the Great Thief the moment we get back.”

Lin Yun could only reply with an awkward smile.

Meanwhile, two figures that were on a tall building near the imperial palace stopped looking at the crowds and turned their attention to the palace. Lin Yun would definitely recognize them, but he would be shocked that they were together. The two figures were the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s Pavilion Master Jian Xuanhe and the Sword Burial Woods’ Lord Thirteen.

“Thirteen, back then you said that you wouldn’t take a step out of the Sword Burial Woods.” Jian Xuanhe looked at Lord Thirteen with a fake smile.

“I gave him my promise that I would protect him, so I naturally can’t watch him die. If I weren’t here, do you really think that you could hold back the Bloodrobe Guards all by yourself?” snorted Lord Thirteen. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Who knows?” Jian Xuanhe stroked his beard. “But the old emperor is smart. He didn’t allow his son to act reckless. I bet the sword from a decade ago gave him a lesson.”

Jian Xuanhe’s tone sounded somewhat disappointed. Ten years ago, if Guardian Plum could have been as decisive as he was today, Jian Xuanhe wouldn’t have to stay in the empire for a decade.

“It looks like you had a decent harvest in the past decade…” Lord Thirteen looked at Jian Xuanhe with his brows frowned.

“You’re not too bad yourself. I believe you’re almost done comprehending the profundities Ancestor Wuming left in the Sword Burial Woods.”

While the two were exchanging sarcasm, two figures suddenly arrived. They were the sect masters of the Heavenly Profound Sect and Demonic Moon Villa. When they saw Jian Xuanhe and Lord Thirteen together, they were both shocked.

“Lord Thirteen!” The two sect masters cupped their hands at Lord Thirteen.

Lord Thirteen merely responded by nodding his head without any changes in his expression.

As for Jian Xuanhe, he wasn’t surprised that the two would come. After all, it would be weird if they weren’t here for something so serious. As major sects, they had a rapport with each other, which included the Sword Firmament Pavilion and the Primal Origin Sect. Their disciples might be competing with each other, but they were united in extremely serious matters.

“The crown prince has the Pure Yang Palace backing him up, which is why he has been so overbearing. The Azure Association has been infiltrating our sects without restraints over the years, so it’s time someone taught him a lesson,” smiled the Profound Heavenly Sect’s Sect Master.

The Pure Yang Palace was one of the nine overlord forces in the Ancient Southern Domain. They could easily leave the Great Qin Empire in a bloodbath because they were an existence that far surpassed the empire.

If Lin Yun and the rest knew about Qin Yu’s backing, they would definitely be shocked. But the sect masters didn’t seem too surprised about it.

“It’s not surprising that the Pure Yang Palace will support him. But who is backing the princess? Does anyone know about it?” asked Jian Xuanhe.

“I can’t see through her.” The Heavenly Profound Sect’s Sect Master shook his head.

The Demonic Moon Villa’s Sect Master pondered for a long time before he revealed, “I do know a thing or two, but I can’t reveal it. This princess’ backing is bigger than what we all imagined.”

His words made everyone’s faces change. The Pure Yang Sect was terrifying enough, but the princess’ backing was an existence even more terrifying than the Ancient Southern Domain’s overlord force?
