Chapter 1870 - Manifestation

“Saint Elder is truly knowledgeable.” Lin Yun was surprised as he looked at Mu Xueling. For some reason, he couldn’t help feeling proud. If he remembered correctly, this was the first time he saw the shock on Mu Xueling’s face, which was rare. Even if she were shocked normally, she wouldn’t show it on her face, so this was the first time he saw a fluctuation in her facial expressions.

“Saint Elder, please go on.” Lin Yun said. He poured himself a cup of Millennium Flame because it was a waste for him to drink the Demigod Wine again.

Mu Xueling raised her head to look at Lin Yun. She could guess that it was probably Lin Yun’s harvest in the Black Tortoise Void Sea. She wasn’t polite with him and gulped down the entire cup. When she was done, her face became rosy, and she was a little intoxicated, even with her cultivation. She gently massaged her head with her eyes closed.

“Saint Elder, are you alright?” Lin Yun asked with his face changing.

A brief moment later, Mu Xueling suddenly opened her eyes with her pupils shining brightly, and a powerful saint aura swept out from her. When a wave of saint aura swept out from her, Lin Yun crossed his arms to resist the pressure, but he was still pushed away.

“Lin Yun, thank you for your wine. I’m making a breakthrough to the Saint Realm now.” When Lin Yun stabilized his footing, he saw Mu Xueling floating towards the lake’s heart.

Coming to his senses, Lin Yun sighed in his heart. He only reached the pinnacle of the Profound Life Stage, relying on the Demigod Wine, while Gu Jun relied on the Demigod Wine to reach the fourth stage of the Quasi-Saint Realm. But Mu Xueling relied on the Demigod Wine to reach the Saint Realm.

Now that he thought about it, his three cups of Demigod Wine have gone down the drain. Would the Demigod Wine have stronger effects if he was at the Quasi-Saint Realm?

Then again, that was just a casual thought because Mu Xueling had long reached the pinnacle of the Quasi-Saint Realm. Her mental energy was comparable to Saints, and she even grasped the Imperial Tune. So even without the Demigod Wine, it was just a matter of time before she reached the Saint Realm.

“Time for me to get going.” Lin Yun muttered to himself. He first paid Yue Weiwei a visit and gently held her hand before leaving behind a letter. But before leaving the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion, he went to look for Gu Jun. After returning to the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion as a Quasi-Saint, the latter received a glorious welcome.

“Holy shit, you’re really bold to come back.” Gu Jun was startled when he saw Lin Yun.

“I’m here to give you something.” Lin Yun smiled.

Gu Jun’s smile disappeared, and he became cautious. He asked, “Don’t even think about putting your ideas on me. I have no treasures that can attract your attention.”

Lin Yun’s expression became weird. Could Gu Jun have had an opportunity in the Black Tortoise Void Sea? But we were together the whole time, so Gu Jun had no time alone. Wait… The Black Tortoise Totem!

Glancing at Gu Jun, Lin Yun instantly understood that Gu Jun probably figured something out from the Black Tortoise Totem.

“Look at it yourself.” Lin Yun couldn’t be bothered about it and took out the Black Tortoise Saint Canon.

Gu Jun wasn’t bothered about it initially, but his expression gradually became agitated. “The Black Tortoise Saint Canon! It’s really the Black Tortoise Saint Canon! Wait, why is there only half of it? Where’s the other half?”

“Half of it isn’t enough to satisfy you? The other half is in the hands of Tian Xuanzi, so you can look for him if you want it.” Lin Yun replied.

Gu Jun’s excitement immediately died down because he now had a phobia of Tian Xuanzi. He cursed, “I won’t let him go for forcibly retrieving my heart’s blood. I’ll go to the Profound Sky Sect to crush him. Does he want to dominate the entire Eastern Desolation? Heh!”

“Are you serious about that?” Lin Yun wore a playful smile.

“I’m naturally serious about it.” Gu Jun’s lip twitched.

“I’ll leave this half of the Black Tortoise Saint Canon in your hands. Without your help, I wouldn’t have obtained the Demigod Wine nor reforged my physique. Don’t be polite with me.” Lin Yun smiled.

Squinting his eyes, Gu Jun smiled, “I naturally won’t be polite with you. But can you give me a little more of the Demigod Wine? I’ll help you squash Tian Xuanzi after becoming a Saint. At that time, you don’t have to hide anymore.”

“No.” Lin Yun indifferently replied. Gu Jun wasn’t the same as Mu Xueling. Even if he gave Gu Jun all the Demigod Wine he had with him, he wouldn’t be able to reach the Saint Realm. As for squashing Tian Xuanzi, it was a pipe dream because he didn’t believe that Gu Jun dared to look for him.

“I'm off.” Lin Yun bade his farewell after sharing a few cups of wine.

“Hey!” Gu Jun called out to Lin Yun. “I’ll be leaving the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion soon. If you want to look for me in the future, come to the Eastern Sea!”

“Okay.” Lin Yun replied.

Looking at Lin Yun’s back figure, Gu Jun exclaimed, “Don’t die so soon. Tian Xuanzi…Tian Xuanzi… *sigh*…”

After leaving the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion, Lin Yun paid the Heavenly Star Pavilion a visit and also gave half of the Quasi-Saint Black Tortoise Cores to An Liuyan. Aside from that, he also gave her all the Saint Artifacts he obtained from the Black Tortoise Vault.

“Young Master, are you going to leave?” An Liuyan asked.

“Yeah. I’m going to the Heavenly Dao Sect.” Lin Yun honestly replied.

An Liuyan’s hands briefly stopped. She had her expectations, but she didn’t think Lin Yun would tell her where he would go. This also proved that Lin Yun trusted her completely.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“I’ll be going into seclusion for a brief moment.” Lin Yun said.

“Understood. Young Master can stay here as long as you want, and I will ensure no one will disrupt you.” An Liuyan smiled.

Lin Yun nodded his head and came to the seclusion chamber. He sat down and circulated the sixth stage of the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon. After his cultivation reached the pinnacle of the Profound Life Stage, Lin Yun mainly focused on stabilizing his cultivation to temper his profound life aura into merging with his body.

Thus, Lin Yun only spent half of his time on it and the second half practicing his sword techniques. He mainly focused on the Divine Firefly Sword and Sword of Beginning.

A month had passed in the blink of an eye. As a powerful technique that Lin Yun had created, Lin Yun tempered the Sword of Beginning again, adding his comprehension to it and reaching a whole new level.

Standing up, Lin Yun took out the book recording the Divine Firefly Sword. The Divine Firefly Sword was created by the Sword Ancestor in the past, and the Sword Ancestor was someone who could compete with the Blue Dragon Ancestral God.

Many holy lands have a record of it, and this sword technique was pretty famous in the Kunlun Realm. But the threshold was too high, and had a total of thirteen sword forms. This was equivalent to a high-grade ghost spirit martial technique.

Only those who've reached the Samsara Edict Realm could practice it, requiring high comprehension. Lin Yun grasped the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent at complete mastery, and his cultivation also reached the Samsara Edict Realm. This sword technique had a high advantage when fighting those in the same cultivation.

“Let’s practice the first sword form to the Manifestation Stage.” Lin Yun muttered. Only by reaching the Manifestation Stage with it could he convert it into being his, and he would completely grasp this first sword form.

For the next month, he had tempered the Sword of the Beginning again before spending most of his time on the Divine Firefly Sword. In addition to his battle with Zhuge Qingyun, his comprehension of the Firefly Radiance had reached a new height. He was confident that he could reach the Manifestation Stage in this sword form.

Lin Yun sat down and went into meditation. Aside from the wind, the entire seclusion chamber was silent. For the next seven days, Lin Yun maintained his meditation. As a powerful gale blew, one could see swords formed by wind coiling around Lin Yun.

As the wind passed through Lin Yun, those swords easily passed through his body, as if he didn’t exist. Without him knowing it, Lin Yun had become one with heaven and earth.

“Even the light of fireflies can compete with the sun.” Lin Yun opened his eyes with light shining brightly on his brows. The surrounding wind suddenly shattered and turned into a speck of dust. The speck of dust emitted a faint radiance. This was the Firefly Radiance, but it was different from what it was in the past. The dust speck seemed like it was alive and had turned into an actual firefly.

“Life…” Lin Yun’s eyes flickered, and his gaze became gentle. He finally comprehended that the profundity of the Firefly Radiance laid in life. If the Firefly Radiance was alive, it would have its own spirituality.

A firefly might be insignificant, but tens of thousands of fireflies would be a completely different story. Who said that the light of fireflies couldn’t compete with the sun?

Lin Yun used two fingers like a sword to thrust forth, and countless fireflies began to gather. When all the fireflies gathered at the tip of his fingers, they formed into a sword ray that seemed insignificant. But when he swung his fingers, the sword ray gave a feeling that anyone who got close to it would lose their life, and even the space couldn’t bear this sword.

Looking at this scene, Lin Yun couldn’t help becoming excited because he didn’t expect the Firefly Radiance to be so powerful.

“Manifestation Stage! This is the real Manifestation Stage!” Lin Yun muttered. His talent was undoubtedly evident since he could reach the Manifestation Stage in the Firefly Radiance when he was only at the Profound Life Stage.

“I have finally taken a step into the technique left behind by the Sword Ancestor…” Lin Yun’s pupils flickered because he knew that this was only the beginning. But after grasping the first form, it would be easier for him to practice this sword technique. At that time, he would have enough means to intimidate everyone in the Heavenly Dao Sect, even if he couldn’t use the Azure Dragon Sword Techniques.
