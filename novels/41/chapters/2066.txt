Chapter 2067: I Want It All

Ye Qingtian’s words were a resounding slap to everyone from the Hidden Sword Manor. Many seniors of the Hidden Sword Manor who were in the dark were furious as countless murderous intents fell onto Ye Qingtian, and the atmosphere became tense.

No one dared to utter a word from the observation stand, and the venue fell into a terrifying silence. This was because no one had been so arrogant within Hidden Sword Manor before, insulting the swords forged by the Hidden Sword Manor to be garbage. Even the sword forged by Feng Shaoyu’s grandfather, the old manor master, was insulted by Ye Qingtian. One must know that Feng Shaoyu’s grandfather was one of the best blacksmiths in the world.

Since the method of forging Sovereign Saint Artifacts was lost, no one had grasped the method to forge Sovereign Saint Swords aside from the mysterious Mo Clan. All the existing Sovereign Saint Swords were left behind from ancient times. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

For example, Firmament and Cauldron were both ancient swords. The Hidden Sword Manor didn’t forge them.

But Feng Shaoyu’s grandfather was a legendary figure, a son-in-law of the Mo Clan. He forged many famous swords, including some Glory Saint Artifacts capable of reaching the power of a Sovereign Saint Sword. Feng Shaoyu’s grandfather was one of the main reasons why the Hidden Sword Manor could lead the entire Sword Alliance.

Everyone would have only taken Ye Qingtian’s words as a joke if he hadn’t snapped the Heavenly Dipper Sword; they would have only treated him as arrogant. But the problem was that Ye Qingtian publicly snapped the Heavenly Dipper Sword!

Not to mention that Ye Qingtian was only at the Nirvana Stage, and his action was no different from a resounding slap to the Hidden Sword Manor’s face. His words were ruthless, but no one could refute what he said. They were only filled with astonishment and bewilderment.

“Young Manor Master, why aren’t you saying anything? Is this reason enough? You can give me a few more swords if you don’t believe me,” Lin Yun indifferently said as he looked at Feng Shaoyu, not letting the latter go so easily.

“What did you say?” Feng Shaoyu asked.

“I said you can give me a few more swords, and I’ll prove to you that the swords forged by the Hidden Sword Manor are garbage,” Lin Yun said.

“Ye Qingtian, don’t push it!” Feng Shaoyu said furiously. “You think the Hidden Sword Manor can’t do anything to you? I can now kill you for insulting our reputation.”

“What a fiery temper you have there. How have I insulted the Hidden Sword Manor? Didn’t you ask me to give you a reason? So I gave you a reason. Are you satisfied with the reason? If you’re unhappy, I can prove it to you a few more times!”

Feng Shaoyu was furious, with his face becoming red. He was furious, but he couldn’t make a move to kill Ye Qingtian, and he didn’t know how to respond under so many watchful eyes.

Feng Shaoyu initially thought he could force Ye Qingtian to make a move and take this opportunity to teach him a lesson. But he didn’t expect Ye Qingtian to snap the Heavenly Dipper Sword. This placed Feng Shaoyu in a difficult position, but he could do nothing about it.

Taking a deep breath, Feng Shaoyu tried to calm himself down. He naturally didn’t dare to bring a few more swords for Ye Qingtian to test. The Hidden Sword Manor’s reputation would be ruined if those swords also snapped.

But he wasn’t willing to agree just like that. He had no intention of giving Ye Qingtian this opportunity right from the start.

Right then, a voice resounded beside his ears that briefly stunned Feng Shaoyu before he calmed down.

“Young Master Ye is truly impressive. The Heavenly Dipper Sword hadn’t been tempered by earth fire, so this is my fault. Three days from now, the Hidden Sword Manor will send you another saint sword, and I guarantee you’ll be satisfied,” Feng Shaoyu said as he calmed himself down.

“So the sword hasn’t been tempered by earth fire?”

“Do you really believe that?”

“Otherwise, why did the sword snap all of a sudden?”

“I don’t think so…”

Lin Yun could hear the discussions from the surroundings, and guessed that someone must’ve said something to Feng Shaoyu for him to calm down. He knew that there wasn’t any problem with the Heavenly Dipper Sword and wanted to find a reason.

“I don’t care about the Heavenly Dipper Sword. I just wish to know if I can borrow Cauldron,” Lin Yun said.

Fe ng Shaoyu’s cheeks trembled, and he gritted his teeth, “You can.”

“When can I attempt the arrays?” Lin Yun asked.

“Arrays?” Feng Shaoyu smiled, “You misunderstand. You have to go through the other arrays if you want to borrow other swords, but you have to defeat the sword wielder if you want to borrow Cauldron.”

“Sword wielder? Who is it?” Lin Yun frowned.

“He’s right in front of you.” Feng Shaoyu said calmly as he looked at Lin Yun with a playful gaze.

“You?”

“That’s right.”

“Who are you shitting? The sword acknowledged someone like you?” Lin Yun said bluntly.

“Not yet, but that doesn’t mean it won’t in the future. Just earlier, the Hidden Sword Manor has decided that I’ll be the sword wielder and have the sword acknowledge me after reaching the Saint Realm. If descendants of the Feng Clan are willing, they can become the sword wielder at any time. This rule has always existed, so don’t say that the Hidden Sword Manor is bullying you,” Feng Shaoyu said.

Even the Hidden Sword Manor seniors couldn’t see through Ye Qingtian’s strength, and they didn’t dare to let him attempt the arrays. After all, the sword would be taken by him if he managed to pass through those arrays.

Thus, they created a sword wielder for now to protect the sword, thus changing the rules. Everyone could tell the Hidden Sword Manor didn’t want Cauldron to be lent to anyone, so they’re trying to make Ye Qingtian give up. Others might have a choice, but Lin Yun didn’t.

“So I can borrow the sword if I defeat you?” Lin Yun asked.

“That’s right.” Feng Shaoyu sneered, “I’ll be honest with you. I’ve reached the Quasi-Saint Realm a year ago and am now at the pinnacle of Azure Origin Phase. I can make a breakthrough at any time. You should know that you’ll die if you want to borrow the sword. If you’re defeated, you’ll no longer be the champion, and you won’t receive any rewards from the Sword Assembly. If I can kill you, there’s nothing the Heavenly Dao Sect can say about it.”

Even a fool could tell that the Hidden Sword Manor didn’t want to lend out Cauldron. If Ye Qingtian still insisted on borrowing the sword, he would offend the Hidden Sword Manor and might even lose his life.

“It’s rare for the Heavenly Dao Sect to produce a genius like you, so you should return. Challenge me again after you reach the Quasi-Saint Realm, and we do not need to fight so soon. My promise will stay in effect, so you can challenge me anytime.” Feng Shaoyu was confident in his strength and that Ye Qingtian wouldn’t dare to fight him. Even if Ye Qingtian caught up with him in the future, they would have plenty of ways to make him unable to come to the Hidden Sword Manor. As long as Ye Qingtian leaves, it would be impossible for him to return.

“I can treat what you said earlier as being ignorant. So you can leave now. A month from now, the Hidden Sword Manor will give you a new Heavenly Dipper Sword and your reward,” Feng Shaoyu said. “You’re still young, so don’t think you’re invincible just because you won during the Sword Assembly.”

As Feng Shaoyu said, he flicked his finger and unleashed an azure saint aura, which condensed into a dazzling sword ray that split the lake into two. The entire lake trembled, and the power of his sword ray was comparable to Ye Qingtian executing the?Sky Incineration Flames.

This instantly drew a series of exclamations from the surroundings because they knew that Feng Shaoyu was demonstrating his strength to Ye Qingtian. If Ye Qingtian leaves now, he could receive a new Heavenly Dipper Sword and the Sword Assembly’s rewards, obtaining fame and fortune. But if Ye Qingtian insisted on borrowing the sword, he might lose his life.

Feng Shaoyu was enveloped in saint aura with a Quasi-Saint’s aura sweeping out.

“You don’t know how high heaven is nor how immense the earth is.” Feng Shaoyu looked cocky and indifferent as he left after releasing that sword ray.

The swordsmen from the Eastern Desolation were shocked by what the Hidden Sword Manor did. Not only did the Hidden Sword Manor come up with a countermeasure, but they even won their reputation back. Compared to the Hidden Sword Manor, Ye Qingtian was too tender, with nothing but arrogance.

The Hidden Sword Manor was bullying Ye Qingtian, but there was nothing anyone could say about it.

Under an adult’s scheme, this made what Ye Qingtian said earlier laughable, and Cauldron couldn’t be borrowed.

“Wait,” Lin Yun called out to Feng Shaoyu.

This shocked everyone.?Does Ye Qingtian still want to borrow the sword after reaching this point?

“Mhm?” Feng Shaoyu frowned with a hint of ferocity flashing across his pupils. He clenched his right fist and seemed impatient.?Does Ye Qingtian want to die?

When he furiously turned around, a violent wind blew over him, making Feng Shaoyu fearful. After the breeze blew past, the lake was split apart as Ye Qingtian lowered his right hand. He had achieved it with a flick of his finger.

This shocked Feng Shaoyu because Ye Qingtian managed to split the lake without using martial techniques.

“Did I say that I’ll just give up? Why are you in such a hurry to leave?” Lin Yun smiled. He might be smiling, but everyone felt a chill when they saw that smile.

“It’s too troublesome to fight you again after reaching the Quasi-Saint Realm, and I can’t afford to wait,” Lin Yun said. “I’ll come to the Hidden Sword Manor in three days. At that time, don’t turn me away. After all, everyone in the Kunlun Realm heard what you said earlier.”

Feng Shaoyu was shocked and didn’t know where Ye Qingtian got the courage.

But Lin Yun couldn’t be bothered and left. As he left, his laughter roared, “Don’t forget to temper the sword again with earth fire. I’ll be taking Cauldron, Heavenly Dipper Sword, and the rewards. I want it all! Three days from now, I’ll see how high heaven is and how immense the earth is with my sword!”
