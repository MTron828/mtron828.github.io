Chapter 1102 - Fleeting Cloud Thirteen Sword

The Flying Cloud Palace was silent for a long time. No one dared to respond to Lin Yun’s question. As for Feng Zhang, he was filled with shame after watching Lin Yun master the sword technique in just seven steps.

With Lin Yun’s version of the sword technique as a point of comparison, even a fool could tell that Feng Zhang’s sword technique was terrible. Each of Lin Yun’s swords was like a resounding slap to his face that made him feel numb. Even worse, he brought up the topic of his sword technique.

If he had kept his mouth shut, he wouldn’t have been so terribly humiliated. Now, there was no way he could show his face in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. At the very least, he had to wait for everyone to forget about what happened.

“Since there aren’t any objections, I’ll assume that everyone agrees.” The sect master’s cold voice sounded out before he barked again, “Don’t think that I had no idea what all of you were doing behind my back for the past three days. Now, do you understand the saying that there’s always someone better in the world?”

All of the disciples had ugly expressions on their faces as the sect master scolded them. The sect master rarely appeared in public, not to mention reprimanding them.

“Over the years, I never saw any one of you stand up to protect the sect’s reputation. So why are you getting so riled up for the quota to ascend the Sword Saint Mountain? All of you even dared to question my decision. Do you doubting my ability?” The sect master snorted. His words made many people’s hearts throb because they finally realized that the sect master already knew about Lin Yun’s strength.

The reason why he didn’t stop Lin Yun was to use the latter to teach them a lesson. Although the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect was still one of the four major sects in the Profound Azure Manor, it had long lost its reputation as the strongest sect. In fact, the sect was showing signs of falling out of the four major sects.

Listening to the sect master’s words, everyone lowered their heads in shame. At the same time, Lil’ Purple’s voice also sounded out of the sword box, “Lin Yun, it looks like the sect master is doing this on purpose. He wanted to borrow your ability to extinguish the pride in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect.”

Lin Yun didn’t say a word because he already knew what the sect master was doing. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been called the sect master an old geezer. Now, he was looking forward to the secrets on the Sword Saint Mountain. At the very least, he knew that the boundless sword intent could complement his sword dao well.

The dao wasn’t complete in the Profound Amber Realm. So Lin Yun was able to sense the complete dao the moment he stepped into Kunlun Realm. At the same time, he knew that his sword intent needed to make an improvement or else it would stop at the third grade.

“Lin Yun!” After the sect master was done reprimanding the disciples, he turned to look at Lin Yun, “From today onwards, you’ll be a core disciple of my Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. Are you willing?”

“It’s an honor,” smiled Lin Yun.

“Then I’ll bestow you a Heavenly token. This means that there are no restrictions to you in the sect. You can go wherever you want.” The sect master tossed a golden token toward Lin Yun after he was done speaking.

Lin Yun could see the symbol of the core disciple on the back of the token with the word Yun engraved on it. Based on this alone, he could tell that the sect master had already prepared this token a long time ago.

Everyone in the palace was shocked at the token Lin Yun received. After all, there were only four heavenly core disciples in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, and they were known as the Four Pillars. Now, they would be called the Five Cores. This token not only symbolized a noble status, but was full of lavish benefits.

Not only could one receive a lot more monthly resources, but they could also go wherever they wanted in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. It was so special that many people were envious. Then again, no one dared to say a word anymore, especially after Lin Yun mastered the Wind Manipulation Sword Technique with seven steps. Even if there were core disciples unhappy about it, they didn’t dare to express it publicly.

“Thank you.” Lin Yun cupped his hands together after taking the token.

Standing on the stage, Ye Ziling’s eyes began to flicker.

“Open the mountain!” The sect master glanced at Lin Yun before instructing the elders to unseal the Sword Saint Mountain.

When Lin Yun looked at the Sword Saint Mountain, flames blazed in the depths of his eyes. He wanted to go to the mountain ever since he arrived. Now, he could fulfill his wish.

“Wait.” Suddenly, Ye Ziling called out when the elders were about to move. When Lin Yun heard her speak, he could tell that she had a high status in the sect. After all, the elders stopped at her command and looked at the sect master to see what to do.

“Ziling, this matter has already been decided,” said the sect master indifferently.

Bowing, Ye Ziling said, “Sect Master, I have no objections to Lin Yun ascending the Sword Saint Mountain, but I'd like to ask that you delay it. The opportunity to ascend the Sword Saint Mountain is precious, and he isn’t even in the Empyrean Realm. I’m afraid that he won’t even be able to make it through the first three tests, so this will be a complete waste of an opportunity. I suggest we wait until he’s in the Empyrean Realm.”

Lin Yun’s impression of Ye Ziling changed. It turned out that she only cared about the sect and wasn’t targeting him on purpose. Now that he had displayed sufficient talent, she naturally wouldn’t stop him from ascending the Sword Saint Mountain. She just wanted him to wait so the trip wouldn’t be a waste.

She’s looking down on me. It’s just three tests.

“It doesn’t matter. I’ll give him another opportunity to ascend the Sword Saint Mountain when he’s in the Empyrean Realm,” said the sect master, which waves in everyone’s hearts. After all, all core disciples only had one opportunity to ascend the Sword Saint Mountain. Despite her status, Ye Ziling wasn’t even an exception.

After all, the opening of every Sword Saint Mountain requires the sect master to be present. On top of that, he would have to spend three months in recovery.

“Father, is it even worth it?” Ye Ziling exclaimed as her face changed.

Lin Yun was shocked that Ye Ziling was actually the sect master’s daughter. However, he remembered from his conversation with Wang Yuruo that the sect master’s surname was Wang. It seemed like there was a story behind Ye Ziling’s name.

The sect master’s eyes flashed with indifference and said, “You shouldn’t be the one to ask me if this is worth it.”

Ye Ziling knew that she had misspoken out of anxiety, but she still wasn’t willing to take a step back. This instantly placed Lin Yun in an awkward position.

“Senior Sister Ye, it appears that you have a misunderstanding of me.” Lin Yun interrupted and smiled.

“The Sword Saint Mountain has 13 tests, which are known as the 13 Fleeting Cloud Tests. The first three tests are so difficult that even Galaxy Stage experts might fail. I’m not targeting you, I’m just stating the facts,” said Ye Ziling after turning to look at Lin Yun.

“Senior Sister Ye, are you really that sure that I can’t make it through the first three tests?” Lin Yun wore a smile. It appears that he had been underestimated.

“That’s right. So I suggest that you don’t waste this opportunity,” said Ye Ziling.

“I don’t believe that I’ll fail. I’m not just targeting the first three tests, but all 13!” Lin Yun’s fighting spirit was riled up. No matter how he looked at it, Ye Ziling was still targeting him.

But the moment he said that, Ye Ziling smiled cunningly, “If you can get through all 13 tests, I can agree to one request of yours.”

“Any request?” Lin Yun said with a playful smile.

Ye Ziling’s eyes flashed coldly after seeing Lin Yun’s playful smile. “Any request! But you also have to agree that you will give up the opportunity to ascend the Sword Saint Mountain again if you fail!”

“Deal.” Lin Yun agreed.

“Lord Sect Master, I have no objection now.” Ye Ziling glanced at Lin Yun with disdain before cupping her hands towards the sect master.

The sect master glared at her before he turned to Lin Yun, “Stay here. I’ll open the mountain with the elders and then you can come over later.”

When he was done, the sect master soared into the sky and flew towards the Sword Saint Mountain. At the same time, an uproar broke out in the Flying Cloud Palace once again as many disciples whispered among themselves. They were under the assumption that Lin Yun did something foolish again.

“Senior Brother Yun!” A cheerful voice sounded out as Wang Yuruo ran over.

Looking at her, Lin Yun’s mood got a lot better, “I like it better when you call me Junior Brother Yun.”

“I dare not.” Wang Yuruo shook her head and continued, “Senior Brother Yun, your identity is even nobler than mine now.”

“Alright then.” Lin Yun smiled before he asked, “What’s with the Fleeting Cloud 13 Tests?”

Wang Yuruo smiled, “Senior Brother Yun, you’re really formidable. Senior Sister Ye made it through the ninth test last year, which is the record of the last century. If you can do what you claim, you’ll break the record of the past millennium.”

At this moment, Lin Yun finally realized why Ye Ziling dared to bet with him. So it turns out that no one had gotten through the 13 tests in the past millennium, not to mention that he was only in the Heavenly Soul Realm. So it didn’t seem possible that he could make it through the 13 tests.

In the past millennium, the best record was the tenth stage. However, that too was enough to shock the entire Profound Azure Manor. It also happened to be when the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s reputation was at its peak.

When Wang Yuruo continued her explanation, the smile gradually disappeared from Lin Yun’s face. He felt like he was tricked and had given up an opportunity to ascend the Sword Saint Mountain.

“Lin Yun, it looks like you’ll really fail this time. I can sense that the Sword Saint Mountain has a huge origin,” said Lil’ Purple in a stern tone. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Lin Yun simply ignored her and looked at Wang Yuruo, “What about the Sword Saint Mountain?”

“The Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords not only have an infamous reputation in the Profound Azure Manor, but even in Eastern Desolation. I heard that there’s a legend that if one can practice all the 13 swords, he or she will be invincible in the Empyrean Realm. Additionally, they will be able to uncover the secrets of Sword Saint Mountain,” said Wang Yuruo.

But just when Lin Yun was about to ask for more, a dazzling light shined out of Sword Saint Mountain that instantly drew everyone’s attention.
