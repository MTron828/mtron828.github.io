Chapter 2179 - Beginning of the Ceremony

Three days later, Lil’ Purple and Lil’ Red woke up. After refining the Divine Dragon Saint Liquid, they both achieved a huge breakthrough. Lil’ Red immediately reached the Quasi-Saint Realm with its bloodline further awakening. It was now giving off a horrifying and unfathomable pressure that made Lin Yun envious. Lil’ Red had a huge advantage when cultivating due to its bloodline.

Lil’ Red’s strength would increase whenever its bloodline awakened. But Heavenly Dao was fair. Those with ancient bloodlines might have a rapid cultivation speed, but their comprehension in saint dao couldn’t be compared to human cultivators, and they could only complement it with their physique. In contrast, the aura that Lil’ Purple gave off was more restrained. Her long hair had shrunken with the silver radiance dissipating. There weren't many changes to her aside from her hair growing a little longer.

After asking Lil’ Purple about it, Lin Yun knew that Lil’ Purple’s cultivation was at the Quasi-Saint Realm, having the same cultivation as him. But in the Iris Secret Realm, she could defeat ten Lin Yuns since she could control the two Sovereign Divine Runes.

“What’s the matter? You want to give it a try?” Lin Yun smiled. He had also just achieved his breakthrough, and hadn’t fought with anyone after grasping the Wind Dao and Thunder Dao. His strength had improved too greatly recently, not to mention that he had also reached the third stage of the Great Profound Sword Canon.

Lin Yun had no idea how strong he was, but if he wanted to make a rough estimation, he should be five times stronger than when he was during the Blue Dragon Record.

“Hmph, I can’t be bothered to fight you. I’m afraid that I might accidentally kill you, and your senior brother will come after me,” Lil’ Purple said righteously and cowered.

Lin Yun wasn’t surprised, so he turned to look at Lil’ Red, giving it an encouraging look.

“Big Brother, you know me. I’m only a cat, so how can I possibly fight you?” Lil’ Red said as it retreated. It had no intentions of becoming a punching bag.

With that, Lin Yun could only give up on fighting, for now. He spent the remaining time in seclusion within the Iris Secret Realm, consolidating the two saint daos while gradually becoming familiar with swapping between the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon and Great Profound Sword Canon.

Very quickly, the ninth of next month arrived, and Lin Yun slowly opened his eyes under some crisp music. A few hundred meters away, Lil’ Purple was seated on the Phoenix Tree, blowing on a leaf. She was enveloped in a saint radiance that made her look flawless and beautiful.

This made Lin Yun briefly stunned, and he had to admit that Lil’ Purple had a unique temperament around her when she’s quiet. As she played the music, the Phoenix Tree seemed to be enjoying it, since the tree was gently swaying along with the music.

After she was done playing, several tree branches from the Phoenix Tree wrapped around Lil’ Purple, which made the latter chuckle.

When Lin Yun stepped forth, Lil’ Purple was done playing with the Phoenix Tree and landed on the ground. Lil’ Purple looked at Lin Yun, and furiously said with a hint of bashfulness, “Why are you staring at me? Do you believe that I won’t dig your eyes out?”

“You’re more beautiful now than you were in the past,” Lin Yun smiled.

“Hmph, since when am I not beautiful? Back then…” Lil’ Purple smiled. But just when she was about to continue, Lin Yun’s gaze fell onto the Phoenix Tree. The tree had grown to ten meters tall.

Lin Yun exclaimed, “A sapling the size of a palm has already grown so tall.”

“That’s because I did a good job of taking care of it!” Lil’ Purple said with a smug smile.

Lin Yun caressed Lil’ Purple’s head, and smiled, “You’ve grown up. So many years have passed in the blink of an eye, and you’re not allowed to cry anymore in the future.”

“I won’t cry. By the way, take this Divine Leaf.” Lil’ Purple said, handing a Divine Leaf to Lin Yun. She continued, “This is given to you by the tree, and this leaf contains her life essence. It’s very precious.”

Lin Yun was a little surprised as he accepted it. But after briefly looking at it, he noticed that it was truly extraordinary. He then smiled while looking at the Phoenix Tree, “Thank you.”

The Phoenix Tree was happy about being praised, and it swayed its branches as if it was telling Lin Yun not to thank her.

“Time to head out.” Lin Yun had stayed within the Iris Secret Realm during this period of time, and the ninth had come without him knowing it. After leaving the courtyard, the Indigothunder Peak Master led the disciples of Indigothunder Peak to the plaza that once held the conferring ceremony of saint disciples.

When they arrived, they saw various different demonic beasts tied to chains. Once the ceremony begins, blood would be required to communicate with the ancestors of the Heavenly Dao Sect. The Heavenly Dao Sect was born long ago, and they once produced many deities. Although the deities have already fallen, there were remnants of their consciousness remaining that could be awakened through the ceremony.

There was a saying that those deities didn’t really die, but that they were still alive somewhere. So by holding the ceremony, they could summon the consciousness of their predecessors.

Aside from that, there was a massive powerful array with a lot of saint crystals piled up. The cores of the array had multiple ancient saint swords that released horrifying auras. With a glance, Lin Yun could tell that this was the array used to summon the Emperor Sword.

But according to what the Indigothunder Peak Master said, this ceremony only had a symbolic meaning since they weren’t able to recall the Emperor Sword no matter how much they tried. The sky lit up at this moment as disciples from the seventy-two peaks, three courtyards, and two palaces gathered together.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

As time flowed, all the significant figures began to arrive. The palace masters of the Heavenly Yin Palace and Dao Yang Palace arrived with various Saints. All the Saints belonging to the Heavenly Dao Sect were practically here, including the masters of the Profound Maiden Courtyard, Holy Spirit Courtyard, and the Nether Orchid Courtyard.

Aside from Saint Realm experts, those who could be on the altar were holy sons and holy maidens. Lin Yun saw the Dao Yang Holy Son, Bai Shuying, Xin Yan, Wang Muyan, and the mysterious Holy Spirit Son on the altar. If he had agreed to become the Indigothunder Holy Son, he would also be able to be on the altar with his cultivation at the Quasi-Saint Realm.

Very quickly, the guests had arrived, and Lin Yun was shocked by the huge array. The Divine Dao Sect, Myriad Thunder Sect, Ming Cult, Heavenly Flame Sect, and Divine Phoenix Mountain were there. Their parties were led by Saint Realm experts, along with several younger generations.

Among which, there were also those amongst the younger generations with a high status, such as the little princess of the Divine Phoenix Mountain, Ji Zixi.

Lin Yun noticed that there was one person who wore a hood, fully concealed. He turned to the Indigothunder Peak Master, and asked, “Who’s that person?”

That person seemed to have a high status since his position was on the same level as the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint and Serene Dust Great Saint. If this person didn’t have a high status, it would be impossible for that person to be in such a high position.

“No idea, but that person should be a valuable guest,” the Indigothunder Peak Master said.

When noon arrived, the Heavenly Yin Palace’s palace master and Thousand Plume Great Saint offered the position of the host, and it ultimately went to the Thousand Plume Great Saint. With that, the ceremony had begun when the Thousand Plume Great Saint gave the order, and all the musicians began to play their instruments.

With music in the background, the Thousand Plume Great Saint began reciting the ceremonial speech. The ceremony was held step by step, and the demonic beasts were beheaded with their blood flowing towards the altar.

A huge sound came from the altar as an ancient light beam exploded. When the pillar of light soared to the sky, it looked like an ancient sword erected between the Heavenly Yin Mountain and Dao Yang Mountain. Ancient voices began to be heard when the beam of light reached the sky. Shortly after, the hundreds of ancient bells that were prepared on the Heavenly Yin Mountain and Dao Yang Mountain were struck.

As the music and bells combined, an intense fluctuation appeared in the sky. As golden clouds continued to accumulate, it felt as though deities had traveled through time and everyone felt a massive pressure.

Lin Yun’s heart was shocked, and he felt suffocating under the pressure. Are there really deities in the world?

Lin Yun was shocked, and this feeling was profound. He was initially quite disdainful of this part of the ceremony, but his mind had now changed since there were many things in the world that were unclear. On the plaza, the other guests who were invited over were also shocked.

“Is this the foundation of the Heavenly Dao Sect? Their deity's radiance is ten times more dazzling than ours.”

“I’m afraid that only the Divine Phoenix Mountain can compete with them.”

“How many deities are required to create such terrifying golden clouds? It looks like the Heavenly Dao Sect was really glorious in the past.”

“This trip is also worthwhile for us to come.” Just looking at the golden clouds was enough to benefit all the Saint Realm experts.

Lin Yun couldn’t help being filled with anticipation as he heard the surrounding discussions. Many Saints were basking in the radiance, and they closed their eyes to sense the light from the deities.

As for Lin Yun and everyone else on the plaza, they didn’t have any comprehension since their cultivation was too low.

“Relax,” the Indigothunder Peak Master smiled. “If you can compete for a spot on the Upper Nine Peaks, you can also have a chance to put the incense on the altar, and you will have a chance in receiving the blessing of the deities. The predecessors of our Heavenly Dao Sect will definitely bless you.”
