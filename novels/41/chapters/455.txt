Chapter 456 - Arrival

Without a doubt, everyone was optimistic of Qin Yu’s chances in this fight. The only thing they were looking forward to was how much Feng Ye could force out of Qin Yu. This wasn’t because they were underestimating Feng Ye, but Qin Yu had crushed all his opponents in the competition.

Feng Ye wasn’t someone like Lin Yun who slew two titles, so everyone was naturally more optimistic for Qin Yu.

“You’re not my opponent. Admit defeat,” said Qin Yu as he looked at Feng Ye. He was unhappy that Lin Yun wasn’t here because this competition was an opportunity for him to kill Lin Yun. If Lin Yun wasn’t here, it would be more troublesome for him to kill Lin Yun in the future.

“Hehe, I know that you’re ruthless to your opponents and that most people will die or be crippled if they don’t admit defeat,” smiled Feng Ye.

“Really? Then why are you still standing here? Get lost!” barked Qin Yu. His tone was arrogant because he didn’t have a favorable opinion of this barbarian. Although sects located at the borders of the empire could participate in the competition, they wouldn’t earn a title. Feng Ye was an exception, not the norm. This made those from the empire extremely unhappy.

Hearing Qin Yu’s words, Feng Ye smiled, “I have no other merits aside from being able to take a beating. Beat me off the stage if you can. Otherwise, you can cut the crap.” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

His words instantly caused an uproar among the spectators. Feng Ye was truly worthy of his name. He knew that Qin Yu was terrifying, yet he still dared to try and provoke Qin Yu.

“You’re courting death,” sneered Qin Yu as he threw out his palm. His origin energy instantly erupted like a volcano in Feng Ye’s direction.

“It is uncertain as to who is courting death!” Feng Ye’s bones began to crackle and his body expanded to a new size. This made the already robust version of him look like a small mountain. When he took a step forward, he was like an ancient beast.

Compared to the Primal Origin Sect’s Dracophant Battle Physique, Feng Ye’s cultivation technique was more primitive. But as he stepped forward, the aura coming from him was just as terrifying. His aura turned crimson as he threw out a punch.

Qin Yu raised his brow and sneered out of contempt, “This is nothing before absolute strength!”

An explosive origin energy erupted from Qin Yu. This was the first time he had used the Profound Yang Art fully and his aura instantly reached the Violet Palace Realm. He no longer wanted to conceal himself in this fight. He wanted to announce to everyone that he was the star of this competition by suppressing Feng Ye.

Feng Ye was briefly stunned by this because he could feel himself being suppressed by Qin Yu’s aura. However, he let out a roar and threw his punch out, “Eat my fist!”

The crimson barb on his fist instantly tore through the air, but Qin Yu faced it calmly and merely pushed his palm out. His aura instantly condensed into a giant that looked like a fire deity. It was a lot larger than Feng Ye.

His palm came crashing down and destroyed everything in its path. When it slammed into Feng Ye, it caused blood to seep out from the corner of Feng Ye’s lips as he was pushed a few steps back.

“Again!” roared Feng Ye. He leaped into the sky and rained down his punches. His punches were like vipers that bared their fangs at Qin Yu. This move of his was shocking and even the sky had turned dark because of it.

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Pitiful tricks.”

Flames burst out from Qin Yu and gathered onto his palm. Shortly after, he sent his palm out at the descending fists. Under the dazzling brilliance that was comparable to a sun, all the vipers were destroyed.

“This is the end,” said Qin Yu as he appeared before Feng Ye and threw another palm out. He had thrown a total of four palms and each palm made Feng Ye throw up a mouthful of blood.

“Get lost!” When he threw out the fifth palm, Feng Ye was blown out from the stage.

Although everyone had expected that Feng Ye would lose, no one had expected that he would lose so miserably. He was completely suppressed by Qin Yu right from the start. But they had to admit that Feng Ye’s defense was powerful since he could still get up on his feet after being knocked off of the stage.

This fight had also revealed Qin Yu’s strength to everyone. They also understood why Qin Yu didn’t reveal much in the competition so far. This was because he was a lot stronger than his opponents, which was why he only needed one hand to defeat Feng Ye.

“Looks like the championship will go to Qin Yu,” exclaimed many people.

“Qin Yu wins. The second match, Snowflake VS Aquaselenic!” The second battle started very quickly, which drew everyone’s attention

Situ Yi and Aquaselenic’s battle naturally attracted everyone’s attention because they both came from the Demonic Moon Villa. For Situ Yi, he had the record of defeating Everluck. Besides this accomplishment, he was simply too outstanding. Even his appearance attracted all the attention of the ladies.

This battle wouldn’t let anyone down. Aquaselenic brought out the Cloudmist Sword that she was famed for, which Situ Yi also fought with. But Aquaselenic used her sword, while Situ Yi used his fan.

The two came from the Demonic Moon Villa and they could both display the essence of the Cloudmist Sword. This instantly placed the battle into a stalemate. Everyone could tell that both Aquaselenic and Situ Yi wanted to make it into the top four. They might be from the same sect, but neither of them were holding back.

In the end, Situ Yi defeated Aquaselenic by half a move. He used his fan to perform the Cloudmist Sword and created a path that belonged to himself.

Aquaselenic might have practiced in the Cloudmist Sword to a high stage, but she surrendered after a hundred clashes because she couldn’t take it anymore. At the same time, she was sending Situ Yi into the top four.

“Thank you, Senior Sister,” said Situ Yi as he cupped his hands together.

“I didn’t let you win. Since you made it into the top four, then you have to get into the top three for the reputation of our sect,” said Aquaselenic. She might’ve lost, but her mood wasn’t bad.

When another person was promoted, the Sword Firmament Pavilion grew increasingly anxious because Lin Yun was still nowhere to be seen. Was Lin Yun going to be absent?

Emperor Qin casually swept his gaze out and announced, “The third match, White VS Azurehill.”

According to the rules, Lin Yun had already lost, so he could only struggle in the loser group. Then again, it was a whole new story if Lin Yun chose Hell Mode. But Emperor Qin didn’t believe that Lin Yun would really pick Hell Mode.

It was difficult enough to fight all the seven titled figures, but the punishment for losing was great. Once Lin Yun chose Hell Mode, there was no way he could take a step back. He would either win or lose everything.

Bai Lixuan and Yue Qing both went on the stage. When Bai Lixuan drew his sword, everyone could feel that he became one with his sword. Paired together with his Saint Physique, Bai Lixuan gave off an unparalleled feeling. When he pointed his sword at Yue Qing, he gave everyone the feeling that Yue Qing had already died. His sword aura had completely suppressed Yue Qing’s fangs.

“Damn it!” Yue Qing wore an awkward expression. Bai Lixuan’s advantage made him feel despair. This made everyone feel that he didn’t deserve to receive a title.

Feng Ye might’ve lost, but he forced Qin Yu to use the Profound Yang Art. This allowed everyone to have a look of Qin Yu’s strength. But right now, when Bai Lixuan pointed his sword over, Yue Qing already knew that he had lost.

“You’re the weakest among the eight of us. You’re still lacking compared to your senior brother, Egret,” said Bai Lixuan.

“Stop. I surrender,” smiled Yue Qing bitterly.

“Thank you,” said Bai Lixuan as he left the stage. He also looked around, wondering if Lin Yun truly wasn’t coming.

“The fourth match, Trueorigin VS Flower Burial,” announced Emperor Qin. Lin Yun’s late arrival was the same as surrendering. They only just had to walk through this procedure for Trueorigin to be promoted. Even if Lin Yun really came, he needed Trueorigin’s agreement to fight.

In the past, there was no such exception. As long as the opponent wasn’t willing and the participant was late, the judge would forcefully announce their loss.

Trueorigin stood on the stage and looked at the judge, “Let’s not waste time. That brat is not coming.”

The judge found it a pity that Lin Yun missed the competition. But the rules were still rules and there was nothing he could do about it.

“Hmmm?” The judge suddenly exclaimed just when he was going to announce Trueorigin’s victory.

“What’s going on?” Trueorigin followed the judge’s gaze and saw a familiar figure at the far end of the streets. He instantly narrowed his eyes into slits.
