Chapter 1411 - Relationship

Lin Yun wants to face an Azureflame Dracoserpent all by himself? Everyone was shocked when they heard that Lin Yun would face an Azureflame Dracoserpent all by himself, especially since it was a monarch demonic beast that could even give Heavenly Elysium Core Realm experts trouble.

But that wasn’t the most troublesome part about the Azureflame Dracoserpent. The Azureflame Dracoserpent had built up a resistance towards sword intent in the Barren Sword Mound, which meant that swordsmen would be much weaker in this secret realm.

“You guys can’t do it?” Lin Yun looked at them and realized that regardless of Ye Ziling and Zhao Yan, their cultivation techniques were too weak when compared to the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon; they couldn’t condense any innate saint aura. So this meant it would be troublesome for them to face an Azureflame Dracoserpent.

The two might be comparable to Saint Clan princes, but they were still too weak when compared to Lin Yun.

“Then, let me deal with them… you guys leave first.” Lin Yun said. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

His words stumped Ye Ziling and the rest because Lin Yun’s words were pretty arrogant. They initially thought Lin Yun would be humble, but he wanted to face the two Azureflame Dracoserpents alone.

“Head for the sword mound. I can sense that it’s hard to gather 100 Spiritual Sword Beads by hunting demonic beasts. So the key will lie in the sword mound, and it might be too late if you guys are late…” Lin Yun urged.

“T-then, be careful.” Ye Ziling wanted to say something, but she recalled how Lin Yun trashed the seven princes and suppressed Qin Cang. Lin Yun was arrogant but he never did anything he wasn’t confident in. “Just lure them away if you can’t deal with them.”

“Be careful!” Everyone else said before they left in the direction of the Barren Sword Mound. The two Azureflame Dracoserpents wanted to stop them from leaving. But when Lin Yun unleashed his killing intent with a smirk, he instantly drew the attention of the two Azureflame Dracoserpents towards him.

Both of the Azureflame Dracoserpents had fear flashing through their pupils because they could sense a terrifying aura coming from Lin Yun.

The crimson eyes of the Azureflame Dracoserpents were locked onto him before turning into two azure streaks that charged at him. They had a colossal size and great rapport, looking like a couple of drills when they charged at him. When they dashed over, they created a powerful wind current that suppressed him.

Lin Yun could sense the surrounding atmosphere becoming heavy. But before he could think more about it, the two Azureflame Dracoserpents had already arrived before him, swinging their wings down like blades.

Lin Yun gently tapped his foot on the ground and avoided their attacks, leaving behind ripples in the surrounding air. But as he retreated, the two Azureflame Dracoserpents separated and sandwiched him from both sides. When they appeared, they were baring their fangs at him. When the wind current tugged, Lin Yun could feel that he was slowly being pulled over to the two Azureflame Dracoserpents.

As the pair of Golden Crow Wings unfolded behind him, he instantly cut off the wind flow from the two Azureflame Dracoserpents. Golden light then surged behind him before forming two loops and clashed with the two Azureflame Dracoserpents.

The collision produced a loud rumble, with a powerful shockwave that spread out. The shockwave made Lin Yun take ten steps back while the two Azureflame Dracoserpents flew away. But they swiftly spread their wings to stabilize themselves.

“It looks like I have underestimated these two monarch demonic beasts…” Lin Yun’s eyes flickered when he saw this scene. These Azureflame Dracoserpents were stronger than the Saint Clans’ princes. Their intelligence wasn’t low, either.

“Well, it looks like I have to be serious now.” Lin Yun muttered. Ye Ziling and the others might not be safe now because the appearance of these two Azureflame Dracoserpents wasn’t normal. He initially planned on playing with them, but it appears that he had to swiftly end this battle.

When Lin Yun took a deep breath, golden light bloomed in his pupils. Circulating the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon, strands of golden Dragon-Phoenix Sword Aura flew from his pores, turning into a golden light that enveloped him, causing Lin Yun’s sword aura to rapidly increase.

As the eighteen strands of Dragon-Phoenix Sword Aura collided, a series of sword vibrations echoed, causing ripples to spread out in the surroundings. When Lin Yun’s sword aura spread out, the aura of the heavenly dragon and divine phoenix easily suppressed the ominous aura from the two monarch demonic beasts.

Under the intimidation of the Dragon-Phoenix Sword Aura, the two Azureflame Dracoserpents could feel death. As Lin Yun circulated the eighteen Dragon-Phoenix Sword Aura, dazzling sword rays dispersed from his body, faintly taking the form of a heavenly dragon and divine phoenix. The heavenly dragon and divine phoenix emitted an ancient and terrifying aura.

After bringing out the full power of the Dragon-Phoenix Sword Aura, Lin Yun tapped his foot in mid-air. This caused fine cracks to spread out in mid-air before he disappeared. Letting out a soft bark, the Flower Burial Sword flew from the sword box as Lin Yun came before an Azureflame Dracoserpent and swung his sword.

The eighteen sword rays fused into the sword, letting the Flower Burial Sword shine with an unprecedented radiance. When the sword ray landed on the Azureflame Dracoserpent, blood splashed, and the Azureflame Dracoserpent was sent flying back.

When the other Azureflame Dracoserpent saw this scene, flames blazed in its pupils. But before it could move, the Golden Crow Wings behind Lin Yun flapped. He then mysteriously appeared beside the Azureflame Dracoserpent, and the sword in his hand drew a perfect arc.

His Dragon-Phoenix Sword Aura was like a violent storm as it landed on the Azureflame Dracoserpent, instantly covering it in holes before it slammed onto the ground. As Lin Yun stood in mid-air, his eyes coldly flashed while wielding the Flower Burial Sword. He was a real king and the so-called “monarch demonic beasts” were nothing before him.

When the two Azureflame Dracoserpents struggled back to their feet, they could sense the danger that Lin Yun was giving off. But rage still blazed in their pupils as they had unleashed all their ferocity at this moment.

This scene made Lin Yun lightly lock his brows because the intelligence of monarch demonic beasts at the Elysium Core Realm wasn’t at all inferior to humans. Demonic beasts might be ferocious, but they were still afraid of death.

Lil’ Purple’s voice resounded, “Lin Yun, there’s something wrong with these two Azureflame Dracoserpents.”

Lin Yun long noticed that something was weird with these two Azureflame Dracoserpents, and Lil’ Purple’s words further confirmed his speculation. But he didn’t say a word. A golden light shone in his pupils, and the golden sword ocean in his brows began to boil.

Lin Yun executed the Carefree 9 Swords—Heavenly Sword Form using blood as ink and sword as a brush. The golden light shining in Lin Yun’s eyes was incomparable to before. His surroundings became black and white when he moved, as if his surroundings had become monochrome. When Lin Yun’s sword rays flew out, he was like an immortal emitting a carefree mood.

Ye Ziling and the rest were fast as they headed straight to the sword mound. But they were also cautious and didn’t dare to be careless throughout their journey.

“Senior Sister, will Junior Brother Lin be alright?” Liu Qingyan asked in a worried tone.

“Don’t overthink about it. He won’t do something he’s not confident in. He’s arrogant, but have you seen him send himself to death? Since he made the decision, he must be confident about it,” said Ye Ziling.

Back in the Profound Azure Prefecture’s Demon Domain, who had expected that Lin Yun would play his flute under the moonlight and kill someone who was openly being protected? Facing the two Azureflame Dracoserpents was easier than what he did back then. But even so, Ye Ziling couldn’t help being a little worried for Lin Yun.

Lin Yun’s pace was too quick. She could still glimpse his silhouette on the Profound Wither Island. But she had no idea how strong Lin Yun had become now. If she was still in the Radiant Snow Clan, she might not be any weaker than Lin Yun, she might even be stronger than him. Whenever she thought about that, she would feel anxious and even regretted that she left the Radiant Snow Clan when she was young.

But she would make the same decision if she was given another chance. She was confident she could catch up to Lin Yun’s pace one day. But while Ye Ziling was in deep thought, several people appeared and blocked their path.

“Just you guys? Where’s Lin Yun?” A familiar voice resounded. When Ye Ziling raised her head, she saw that it was Xiahou Yan who spoke. Xiahou Yun and Bai Zhanli didn’t say a word while standing beside Xiahou Yan, and the geniuses from the two Saint Clans were gathered together.

Aside from that, four people were also standing together with the two Saint Clans. Those four were arrogant and didn’t place anything in their eyes; they were the four brothers of the Huang Clan.

Ye Ziling’s heart sank when she saw the people who stood in their path. The four brothers of the Huang Clan were famous amongst the four Ancient Saint Clans, and she never expected that they would be together with Xiahou Yan.

“So, you guys are the mastermind!” Gongsun Yan cursed after he recovered from a brief shock.

“Looks like that fellow decided to be the hero and stopped the two Azureflame Dracoserpents. That fellow is really arrogant.” Xiahou Yun sneered.

“The two Azureflame Dracoserpents shouldn’t be able to stop Lin Yun,” said Bai Zhanli.

Right then, the geniuses of the two Saint Clans spread out, soaring to the sky while looking at Ye Ziling’s party. They naturally had no intention of letting them go.

“You guys shouldn’t have gathered enough Spiritual Sword Beads. If I make you guys hand them over, it should be impossible for you guys to join the Sword Sect.” Xiahou Yan suddenly said.

Their faces changed when Ye Ziling and her party heard what Xiahou Yan said. They were only one step away from joining the Sword Sect, so how could they accept being eliminated?

“What do you want?” Ye Ziling asked.

“Nothing much. I heard that Flower Burial is someone who greatly cherishes relationships. So I’m interested to see if he’ll pick his relationships over the Bodhi Seed.” Xiahou Yan replied.
