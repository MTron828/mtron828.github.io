Chapter 2428 - Reinforcements

The Divine Phoenix Mountain’s party also noticed the powerful aura along the way and the cheers. Compared to Ye Guhan’s group of four, the Divine Phoenix Mountain had more people and were riding Profound Birds and other aerial spiritual beasts, forming a grand party.

On this trip, the Divine Phoenix Holy Master brought five Great Saints, ten Saint Sovereigns, and over sixty Saint Lords. They only left behind two Great Saints to guard the Divine Phoenix Mountain and had practically dispatched all their saints. The Saint Lords were mostly ninth-stage Saint Lords or Quasi-Saint Sovereigns.

The Great Saints would be the spears, the Saint Sovereigns were the foundation, and it was rare for Saint Lords to have a chance to fight. The Divine Phoenix Holy Master practically dispatched every force available, and they could even use a secret technique to activate their Phoenix Bloodline for a brief moment.

The Profound Birds were heading to the Sword Sect. The Divine Phoenix Holy Master and Lil’ Purple flew at the front, with the Great Saints following behind. But Lil’ Purple was seated on the Iris Sword Box as she caressed Lil’ Red.

Lil’ Red had been going into seclusion during this period. In addition to the saint elixirs from the Divine Phoenix Mountain, Lil’ Red had already activated eighty percent of its bloodline. It had undergone a drastic transformation compared to the last time Lin Yun saw it, and it could transform into the Ancient Dracoape at any time.

Suddenly, Lil’ Purple stopped and turned in the Profound Sky Sect’s direction. She asked, “You hear anything?”

“Wipe out the Sword Sect and kill the Radiant Sword Saint...” The Divine Master Holy Master said, and the Divine Phoenix Mountain’s party wore grave expressions as they looked at the Profound Sky Sect, which became enveloped in a powerful aura.

“What do you think about Tian Xuanzi’s strength? Can you restrict him?” Lil’ Purple asked. Only the Great Saints could join a battle of this level, but they would be useless if they couldn’t restrict Tian Xuanzi.

The Divine Phoenix Holy Master said, “I don’t know. There’s something weird about him, and all the fortune in the Ancient Barren Domain seems to have gathered on him, giving me an unrealistic feeling. I’m not sure if I can restrict him. He’s practically another Lin Yun but from five hundred years ago.”

Lil’ Purple glared at the holy master, “How can he be compared to Lin Yun? I’m asking you to fight him, not praise him!”

“Lord Phoenix, who knows how many people will die if I make a mistake, and I don’t dare to give a guarantee,” the Divine Phoenix Holy Master smiled bitterly.

Despite what Lil’ Purple said, she was a reasonable person. Speaking of Tian Xuanzi, she had met him multiple times, and she knew that what the holy master said wasn’t false.

“There’s something I’m curious about. Why is that person behind Tian Xuanzi after the Sword Sect? Even if the Radiant Sword Saint becomes an Emperor, it’s hard for him to pose a threat to the Divine Dragon Empire. Furthermore, the Radiant Sword Saint knows the big picture, and he will guard the Kunlun Realm if the Demonspirit Clan comes back,” Lil’ Purple frowned.

“Lord Phoenix, there’s a rumor,” the holy master said.

“Go on.”

“The Kunlun Realm is divided into different regions, but there are only nine ancient domains. The other eight domains are already under the control of the Divine Dragon Empire, and there are rumors that the nine ancient domains have nine Greater Dragon Pulses beneath them. The Empress seems to be planning to sacrifice the dragon pulses to reach the Deity Realm.”

Lil’ Purple’s face changed before she said, “The Ancient Barren Domain’s dragon pulse is beneath the Sword Sect? Let’s not mention if this method can let her reach the Deity Realm, but many people will perish even if it succeeds. The Sword Sect would be the first to perish.”

“This is why Yu Qingfeng doesn’t allow it, and the Divine Dragon Empire can only push Tian Xuanzi out,” the holy master said.

Lil’ Purple hatefully said, “So even if you praised Tian Xuanzi, it doesn’t change the fact that he’s the dog of the Empress! The dog that made Lin Yun suffer so much!”

Lil’ Purple was gritting her teeth with a chill on her face. She recalled how Lin Yun’s dragon pulses were damaged and nearly died. That was Lin Yun’s closest experience with death ever since he came to Kunlun Realm.

“Little Ancestor, let’s go to the Sword Sect first. I bet the entire Sword Sect is feeling uneasy now,” a Great Saint behind the holy master spoke out, seeing that Lil’ Purple showed signs of charging straight to the Profound Sky Sect.

When they addressed Lil’ Purple as ‘Ancestor’ back then, they were reprimanded by her to either address her as Lord Phoenix or Little Ancestor.

“I know what I’m doing,” Lil’ Purple said. She promised Lin Yun that she would protect the Sword Sect and not let her feelings get the best of her. If they charged to the Profound Sky Sect now, they would only be courting death and would not be able to help the Radiant Sword Saint during his tribulation.

While everyone in the world only knew that the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion was proficient in music dao, no one knew that they were from the Azure Dragon’s lineage. In the main hall, everyone from the Azure Dragon’s lineage who had scattered throughout the Kunlun Realm had gathered, and they were all saints.

The pavilion master sat on the main seat with an old man beside him, the old patriarch who competed with the Divine Dragon’s lineage in the past. The atmosphere in the hall was tense, with everyone wearing a grave expression.

The pavilion master took out the Wind God Order and said, “This is the Wind God Order left behind by Lin Yun. No matter what, we’re in his favor.”

“We have to return this favor no matter what. Even without the Wind God Order, he’s someone chosen by the Azure Dragon Lord, and we can’t see him die!”

“That’s right! We have to protect Lin Yun!”

“The Azure Dragon Lord must have a reason to choose him, not to mention that he has a good reputation, saving nine sects in the God Burial Mountain Range by himself.”

“I have no opinion against that.”

“Me neither!” Everyone was naturally discussing the Radiant Sword Saint’s tribulation, and they didn’t hesitate about saving Lin Yun. Let’s not mention the Wind God Order, but the fact that the Azure Dragon Lord has chosen Lin Yun meant that the Azure Dragon’s lineage couldn’t ignore this matter. But protecting Lin Yun was the same as safeguarding the Sword Sect.

“We have to protect Lin Yun no matter what, but we can’t participate in the Radiant Sword Saint’s tribulation. It’s Lin Yun’s matter if he joins in, so we just have to save him if his life is in danger.”

“That’s right. Tian Xuanzi is only targeting the Radiant Sword Saint.”

“His tribulation is too terrifying, and it’s useless even if he tried to help him.”

“Lin Yun has a deep connection with the Sword Sect, and he won’t be willing to accept the Azure Dragon’s lineage with the Sword Sect still around.”

“The identity of our Azure Dragon’s lineage is sensitive, and we will draw out the Divine Dragon’s lineages if we make a move, and the Empress will be unhappy.”

A hundred thousand years ago, the Azure Dragon’s lineage was grand because of the rules set up by the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity that the Azure Dragon’s lineage would inherit the sect master of the Dragon’s Gate. This naturally made the Seven Divine Dragons’ lineages unhappy, but they didn’t dare to do anything with the Blue Dragon Ancestral Deity around.

A hundred thousand years later, the Seven Divine Dragons’ lineages established the Divine Dragon Empire, placing the Azure Dragon’s lineage in an awkward position. The Azure Dragon’s lineage was scattered throughout Kunlun Realm because of that Empress, which left everyone with a huge nightmare.

The pavilion master sighed and said nothing. He naturally agreed with it since no one would fear to die protecting Lin Yun. After all, Lin Yun was chosen by the Azure Dragon Lord, and the Azure Dragon’s lineage still acknowledged the Azure Dragon Lord’s position even after a hundred thousand years. But the Radiant Sword Saint’s tribulation was another story.

In a nutshell, the Azure Dragon Lord didn’t say anything about protecting the Radiant Sword Saint or the Sword Sect.

“A bunch of cowards.” The old man beside the pavilion master scolded as the main hall became quiet. This old man was the Azure Python Great Saint and the current patriarch of the Azure Dragon’s lineage.

“Those willing to protect Lin Yun will guard outside the Sword Sect, and we will make a move if his life is in danger. You will command these people,” the Azure Python Great Saint gave the order. He continued, “Those willing to protect the Radiant Sword Saint will follow me to the Sword Sect. Let me see if there’s still anyone with guts in the Azure Dragon’s lineage.”

Ultimately, three out of six Great Saints from the Azure Dragon’s lineage decided to follow the Azure Python Great Saint.

The pavilion master asked, “Father, who will the ancestor follow?”

The ancestor was an Azure Dragon whose life force was declining. He was the greatest trump card of the Azure Dragon’s lineage, and he could rival the Nine Emperors as well.

The Azure Python Great Saint pondered, then said, “It will follow you. The Radiant Sword Saint can die, but we must protect Lin Yun no matter what, even if we must let the ancestor make a move.”

He might seem reckless, but he placed more importance on Lin Yun. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have brought the ancestor to the Sword Sect as well. With this arrangement, the others from the Azure Dragon’s lineage heaved a sigh in relief. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Outside the God Burial Mountain Range, Mei Zihua and Li Wuyou sat on a celestial crane with a mysterious black-robed man standing behind them.

“Why are we not going to the Sword Sect but the God Burial Mountain Range?” Mei Zihua asked, baffled.

Li Wuyou said, “The Great Profound Sword Array will be activated, and we can’t enter if our identities aren’t clear, even if we have gone against the order of our clans to come.”

Mei Zihua came from a musical clan, while Li Wuyou came from an ancient clan, and their clans were based in the Divine Dragon Empire. They were only acquainted with Lin Yun and not the Sword Sect. So, the Sword Sect wouldn’t let anyone from the Divine Dragon Empire enter, even if they went against the order of their clans and brought a Great Saint with them.

“Hehe, that’s normal. It’s easy for an array to crumble from the inside. So they naturally won’t let anyone with unclear identities enter,” the black-clothed man chuckled. In reality, he wasn’t a righteous Great Saint. Mei Zihua and Li Wuyou’s clans didn’t dare to be involved with the Radiant Sword Saint’s tribulation, so they invited a Great Saint of the demonic path at a great price.

“Wait for the Ninth Princess. She will definitely make a move, and we have also done our best at that time,” Li Wuyou said in a concerned tone.
