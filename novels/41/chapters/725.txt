Chapter 726 - Who’s the Protagonist

Qin Xu was arrogant as he called the youth who failed the challenge a piece of trash. But no one dared to underestimate him. The seven geniuses might be overbearing and arrogant, but they had a good reputation in Skymound City as they were the pride of the city. The seven geniuses were all talented individuals.

“Wow, Qin Xu is making his move so early!”

“Yeah. The three stages aren’t simple and it’s not that easy. Just think about how the guy before him died. Qin Xu is actually really confident.”

“Haha, he’s Qin Xu. Since he dares, he must be confident!” Qin Xu was really popular in Skymound City, so many people were optimistic about him. The Qin Clan’s elders all wore a smile as this was an opportunity for Qin Xu as well as the Qin Clan.

Lin Yun was standing among the crowd, donned in white clothes wearing a white mask. However, he wasn’t carrying his sword box and held the Flower Burial Sword in his hand. Looking at Qin Xu, Lin Yun’s eyes surged with a cold killing aura. He remembered this fellow well. Qin Xu was the one who called him a sword slave outside the Profound Note Bell.

“Qin Xu, which stage will you pick?” Someone spoke out from the three forces. Clearly, they also paid attention to the seven geniuses in Skymound City.

Qin Xu smiled, “The Heavenly Demon Pavilion of course!”

There was no doubt that Qin Xu would pick the Heavenly Demon Pavilion. He had the strongest physique among the seven geniuses, especially after he was beastified in the secret realm.

Qin Xu soared into the sky towards the stone statue. The stone statue came to life as it roared. Qin Xu didn’t panic as a ferocious demonic ape appeared behind him.

The stone statue flew into the sky before throwing a punch towards Qin Xu. Qin Xu didn’t dare to be careless as he wore a grave expression. His right hand beastified quickly and grew into a demonic ape’s arm. When the two hands clashed together, the collision between their attacks created a huge explosion.

The soundwave still lingered in the air as the statue threw out three more palms. Each of its palms were shrouded in demonic aura. After five palms, the stone statue was shrouded in a crimson radiance and blood dripped from Qin Xu’s lips. Clearly, the test in Heavenly Demon Pavilion was harder than he had imagined.

“Demonic Ape Transformation!” Qin Xu roared and his muscles began to swell before the sixth palm landed down. After his body beastified completely, he threw out a palm that scattered the crimson aura of the stone statute. Qin Xu’s eyes lit up when he saw this and he took the opportunity to land on the stage.

“Not bad, using five palms to get through the test.” The Heavenly Demon Pavilion’s elder nodded his head as he looked at Qin Xu. Hearing that, Qin Xu rejoiced as he reverted his transformation.

Seeing that Qin Xu had passed the test, cheers rang out from the crowd. Shortly after, everyone started getting up to try the tests. But it was a pity that the success rate was low and the consequences of failing were dire. Failure could result in broken ribs or dying without a corpse. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Looking at this situation, no one could stop their hearts from jumping. Meanwhile, the Northern Snow Manor’s test was even more terrifying. The swords on the stage were emitting a sharp aura and there were people who were severed into two when they flew over.

Even more terrifying was that the test would readjust according to the strength of the challengers. The stronger the test, the more swords that would be activated. The most terrifying scene was nine swords flying around on the stage.

Even more bizarre was Indigomoon Elysium’s stage as it only had a purple moon hanging high in the sky. There were people who tried to approach that stage, but the scene frightened everyone when they saw people who tried to approach the Indigomoon Elysium’s stage growing old at a visible speed before eventually dying. When everyone looked at the moon hanging high in the sky again, they didn’t dare to look at it directly.

Lin Yun’s eyes flickered beneath the mask. The Blood Devour Demonic Canon was created from the Indigomoon Scripture. Now that he looked at it again, there was something demonic about this cultivation technique. After witnessing the purple moon, no one dared to try. On the contrary, there were still people fighting for the Heavenly Demon Pavilion and Northern Snow Manor.

It didn’t take long for more of the seven geniuses to start appearing. First was Ouyang Hao, the Skycloud Sect’s disciple. But compared to the top three overlord forces, the Skycloud Sect was nothing.

If he could join one of the three overlord forces and become the personal disciple of a Heavenly Soul Realm elder, there was no doubt that it would be great for the Skycloud Sect. Among the seven geniuses, he was the first to declare that he would kill Lin Yun, but he was the first to be defeated by Lin Yun.

He might seem overbearing, but he could only run cowardly before Lin Yun. Later, when Lin Yun was suppressed by the Profound Note Bell, he shamelessly humiliated Lin Yun. He swept his gaze at the three stages before landing on the Heavenly Demon Pavilion’s stage.

After six palms, he threw up a mouthful of blood and nearly failed the test. When he landed on the ground, Qin Xu nodded his head as a greeting. With that, everyone had a gauge of the tests. The tests might be dangerous, but there was no doubt that the Heavenly Demon Pavilion’s test was the easiest.

A brief moment later, the Jin brothers came and chose the Northern Snow Manor. The two of them triggered nine swords, forcing them to use their trump cards before they managed to stand on the stage.

After them, Gu Yang tried his luck. Like the Jin brothers, he also chose the Northern Snow Manor and triggered eight swords, which caused a commotion. Many people break out in a cold sweat for him. However, Gu Yang unleashed his full strength along with his marital soul, which emitted a sharp killing aura.

As the swords hovered in the sky, he relied on this martial soul to defeat them. This scene made the Jin brothers unhappy. After all, they triggered nine swords together, while Gu Yang triggered eight swords by himself.

Looking at this scene, many elders from the Northern Snow Manor nodded their heads at Gu Yang. This made everyone’s eyes dim because they knew that the stages were only meant for the seven strongest geniuses of Skymound City.
