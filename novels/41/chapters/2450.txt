Chapter 2451 - Time Reversed

After the Black and White Emperors separated, the Black Emperor didn’t take long to arrive at the Black-White Sacred Palace. This was a holy land managed by him and the White Emperor. The foundation might not be as strong as the other holy lands, but it had thousands of years of history.

In terms of strength, it surpasses the holy lands in the Ancient Barren Domain. After all, just the fact that there were two mythical emperors was enough to suppress the other holy lands. Over the years, the Black-White Sacred Palace’s position and the Divine Dragon Empire rose.

The Black Emperor quietly came to the Black-White Sacred Palace without alarming anyone. He didn’t head to the forbidden grounds but an insignificant pavilion, entering a secret realm through it. The secret realm was an isolated, small world that looked ordinary.

Opening the gate within the secret realm, he came to another secret realm, repeating several times before he finally reached his target. There were nine secret realms in total, and the gates were located in a different place in each realm. The real treasure was hidden in the depths of the secret realms, and the secret realms were filled with restrictions that not even Emperors could break them forcibly.

“Found it!” The Black Emperor stopped before a jar with three talismans on it. With a grave expression, the Black Emperor muttered, “The Heavenly Dragon’s soul!”

There was a pure-blooded Heavenly Dragon’s soul sealed in the jar, the trump card left behind by the Southern Emperor to refine the Heavenly Dragon Bone. Keeping the jar, the Black Emperor continued and retrieved a massive cauldron. The cauldron had countless dragon runes on it, and it was the supreme treasure of the Dragon Clan, the Myriad Dragon Cauldron.

Nodding his head, the Black Emperor continued till he arrived in a pool enveloped in seven-colored radiance. The pool was all divine dragon saint liquid, but it was different from the one Lin Yun had seen in the past. The liquid was refined with seven divine dragon saint liquids, releasing a seven-colored radiance.

The Black Emperor took out a jade bottle containing all seven-colored divine dragon saint liquids. This lasted fifteen minutes before the seven-colored divine dragon saint liquids were drained. But the Black Emperor didn’t stop and continued until he arrived before a wall where the Samsara Divine Rune was located.

“Seeing how he activated the divine runes on the sword box, they should be the Solar Lunar, Extreme Wind, Sinful Fire, and Myriad Lightning Divine Runes,” the Black Emperor muttered. He continued, “The Samsara Divine Rune is with me, whitey went to retrieve the Freezing Chill Divine Rune and the Nirvana Divine Rune is left...it should be located at the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain.”

The location of six sovereign divine runes could be determined, and only the Nirvana Divine Rune was left. He wasn’t sure if Lin Yun had obtained the Nirvana Divine Rune in the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain. Logically speaking, he should have also obtained it since he obtained the Heavenly Dragon Bone. After all, the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain wasn’t stingy, which meant all seven sovereign divine runes were gathered.

“Killing a deity in the saint realm!” The Black Emperor’s facial expression became grave. From the start, he didn’t agree with the Empress’ method. Even if she became a deity, there was something she couldn’t resolve. After all, those with a cultivation above the Emperor Realm couldn’t enter the God Burial Mountain Range.

If Lin Yun’s cultivation didn’t reach the Emperor Realm and could slay deities in the Saint Realm like the Iris Sword Saint, he would be the perfect candidate to enter the God Burial Mountain Range. Compared to the White Emperor, the Black Emperor thought more about it. Once everything was taken, the Black Emperor left the Black-White Sacred Palace without anyone knowing, but he didn’t head directly to the Ancient Barren Domain.

Instead, the Black Emperor came to a teahouse, and the owner brought him to a secret chamber.

“Inform the other Dragon Kings and tell them that Su Ziyao has inherited the Annihilation God Lord’s legacy with phenomenon as a myth and grasped the Heavenly Fate Talisman. She’s already married to Lin Yun, and they’re on their own to make decisions,” the Black Emperor said.

The Dragon Kings aren’t pure-blooded Dragon Kings, but a form of title. For example, the White Dragon’s lineage patriarch was called the White Dragon King.

This teahouse’s owner was the Black Emperor’s hidden guard, who helped him send information to contact the various clans and divine dragon clans in the Divine Dragon Empire.

The Divine Dragons had seven lineages, and the Empress could control the Golden-Purple Divine Dragon’s lineage entirely but not the other six lineages. The Blue Dragon’s lineage disappeared and didn’t get involved with establishing the Divine Dragon Empire, and only five lineages were left.

Wanting to rebel against the Empress was more challenging than the White Emperor thought. It was realistic with plans and preparation because the Empress controlled the Profound Imperial Palace. In crucial times, she could even command the entire Divine Dragon Empire. The only method was to divide them from the internal. At the very least, let some people maintain their neutral position.

“The Heavenly Fate Talisman?” The owner was shocked.

The Black Emperor nodded, “They know what it signifies, and it’s currently in Lin Yun’s hands. He will surely give it to Su Ziyao. You just have to pass my message.”

“Roger that.” The owner quickly left.

When the Black Emperor finished drinking his tea, his face changed, and still wasn’t in a hurry to the Ancient Barren Domain. Compared to him, the White Emperor’s trip was smoother, releasing his phenomenon as a myth to intimidate the Frostsnow Sacred Palace, scaring everyone.

The Ice Emperor was forced to show himself. When the White Emperor explained his objective, he ‘borrowed’ the Freezing Chill Divine Rune. There was nothing the Ice Emperor could do about it when a mythical emperor was shameless.

There was a long journey to the Ancient Barren Domain from the Divine Dragon Empire, but that wasn’t an issue to Emperors. When the Black Emperor retrieved the jar, the White Emperor reached the Ancient Barren Domain and could see the crimson sword ray from afar.

The entire Ancient Barren Domain was enveloped in crimson radiance, and even the White Emperor had fear in his eyes when he looked at the sword ray’s direction. He muttered, “Unless someone destroys the Sword Sect’s saint vein, even an Emperor won’t dare to step into the sword ray’s region recklessly.”

That place contained the power of heavenly dao. The stronger someone was, the stronger the suppression would become.

“Since Tian Xuanzi is dead, the Empress might not move to interrupt the Radiant Sword Saint’s tribulation. Her objective should be the dragon vein.”

According to the Empress’ original plan, she wanted to use Tian Xuanzi to destroy the Sword Sect’s saint vein and obstruct the Radiant Sword Saint’s tribulation before taking over the dragon vein. There was no need for Emperor Realm experts to make a move because Yu Qingfeng wouldn’t interfere if that were the case. But if Yu Qingfeng makes a move, even someone as powerful as Yu Qingfeng wouldn’t be able to control the situation.

“Tian Xuanzi is way better than the Blade Emperor,” the White Emperor commented. He didn’t hate Tian Xuanzi, who was merely a painting. He could inflict heavy injuries on Lin Yun at the last moment, but he didn’t do that. He might be a person from a painting, but many people outside the painting couldn’t be compared to her.

Just when the White Emperor was going to approach the Sword Sect, a voice sounded, “White Emperor, I’m here under the Empress’ order to wait for you here.”

The White Emperor swept his gaze and saw a mountain enveloped in golden radiance and dragon aura.

“Golden Dragon King?” The White Emperor recognized this person, the patriarch of the Golden Dragon’s lineage. The Empress gave him the title of Golden Dragon King. The Empress came from the Golden Dragon Lineage, but her bloodline underwent mutation and turned into the Golden-Purple Dragon’s bloodline.

The White Emperor was baffled, but he still descended. When he arrived at the mountain, he noticed that aside from the Golden Dragon King, the Silver Dragon King was also here as they sat together, as were four Emperors from the Profound Imperial Palace.

Aside from that, the Emperors of the Ming Cult, Myriad Lightning Sect, and Heavenly Flame Sect were also present, standing in the outer circle. This made the White Emperor’s heart sink, and it was no wonder the Empress was so calm about Tian Xuanzi’s death. So, it turns out that she had a backup plan.

“Lord White Emperor, have a seat,” the Golden Dragon King smiled. He continued, “The Empress has told us about your arrival.”

The White Emperor had no change on his face as he could deal with these people easily. Thus, he replied, “Sure.”

“Where’s Lord Black Emperor? Why didn’t he come with you?” The Silver Dragon King asked casually. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“The Black Emperor...” The White Emperor wanted to devise an excuse. But he suddenly felt something wasn’t right as a massive dragon banner enveloped this entire region with a boundless emperor’s aura. The banner represented the Divine Dragon Empire’s fortune, and the power could surpass that of Sovereign Saint Artifacts.

Didn’t the Empress keep this with her to deal with Yu Qingfeng?

The White Emperor’s face sank, his facial expression becoming grave. These people couldn’t kill him, but they could hold him down with the use of this banner.

“Lord White Emperor, calm down and watch how we deal with the enemies. You just have to stay here to contribute!” The Golden Dragon King said respectfully as he poured wine.

The White Emperor wondered if the Black Emperor had predicted this scene. He didn’t flare up on the spot and said coldly, “The Empress, very good!”

Back to the Sword Sect, Lin Yun and everyone gathered on the Scarlet Firmament Peak after dismissing the disciples and elders. But it didn’t take long before the entire Sword Sect began to tremble as boundless saint energy poured out from the saint vein, heading towards the crimson sword ray.

“Master’s heart demon is resolved!” Ye Guhan rejoiced. This was a sign that their master was extracting the saint vein, which meant he would face his tribulation soon.

Lin Yun turned to look at the crimson sword ray. He saw the Radiant Sword Saint soaring to the sky and pushed his hands forward at the sky as he began devouring the saint energy in the world. At the same time, a powerful aura began to spread out.

The faces of Lin Yun and everyone changed as they came beneath the Blue Dragon Divine Cauldron to isolate the pressure. But before they could heave in relief, time and space began to change in the region where the Radiant Sword Saint was, which looked like time rolling back with various scenes appearing. Time was reversed to three thousand years ago when the Sword Sect was at its prime.

Back then, the Sword Sect was the strongest sect for swordsmen, and it had reappeared once more before everyone’s eyes. Just as they sunk into the majestic scene of the Sword Sect, a powerful pressure descended before manifesting into a white-clothed figure.

“Yu Qingfeng!” Lin Yun exclaimed, causing everyone's faces to change. That wasn’t the real Yu Qingfeng but was manifested because of the Radiant Sword Saint’s tribulation.

Lin Yun opened his mouth and wondered if the tribulation was a replay of Yu Qingfeng destroying the Great Firmament Peak and Profound Firmament Peak.
