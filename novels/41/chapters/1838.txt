Chapter 1839 - Starry Sky Secret Realm

Everyone in the vault was shocked by the strength Lin Yun displayed. After all, Lin Yun merely used one palm to send nine pinnacle Profound Life Stage experts flying away. Aside from the three God Generals who possessed a Glory Saint Artifact, the remaining six were heavily injured and could no longer put up a fight.

Many people’s gaze began to flicker as they looked at the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown on Lin Yun’s head. Lin Yun might’ve been strong before, but that was incomparable to now and it was all thanks to the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown.

“Damn it!” The Fire God General’s face was pale, and he dashed forth once more. As the Nethermoon Saint Armor shone with a crimson radiance, crimson saint runes were activated, and a powerful dragon origin charged forth under the crimson aura.

“Good, come!” Lin Yun raised his brow and stomped his foot on the ground before he soared to the sky. The Golden-Purple Dragon Crown shone brightly, and a golden-purple dragon coiled around his fist before he clashed with the Fire God General’s Glory Saint Artifact head-on.

Along with a huge explosion, a powerful current swept out and Lin Yun only took two steps back before he regained his foothold. This meant he actually took the Fire God General’s attack head-on.

“Hahaha!” Lin Yun laughed. Previously, he was in a disadvantageous position when he fought with the Fire God General. After the Fire God General brought out his full strength, the immense power gave the Fire God General enough strength to suppress him.

That suppression naturally made him unhappy and felt as though he was bound by something. Thus, his attacks were greatly weakened as a result. But now, the Fire God General couldn’t get the upper hand, even if he used his Glory Saint Artifact.

Lin Yun had yet to refine the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown and Black Thunder Chains. But in terms of origin, the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown was a lot stronger. After Lin Yun seized the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown, he made a strong comeback. Who said that the Black Tortoise Void Sea wasn’t for those at the Dragon Pulse Realm?

On the contrary, the Fire God General’s face was dark. After they clashed head-on, he was fearful of the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown’s power. One must know that he had used his cultivation, martial dao, and Nethermoon Saint Armor. He could be considered an invincible existence within the Black Tortoise Vault, and no one could stand in his way. But Lin Yun appeared out of nowhere and became his greatest obstacle.

“Lin Xiao, hand over the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown and I can let you pick five treasures in this vault.” The Fire God General took a step back with a cold light flashing across his pupils.

Hearing what the Fire God General said, Lin Yun smiled, “You’re really interesting. Is your name written anywhere in this vault? Let me tell you, you can dream about getting the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown!”

“You must be getting over your head. Let me teach you a lesson!” A murderous aura raged within the Fire God General’s pupils, and he lost it completely. This was because he could hear from Lin Yun’s tone that he wanted to monopolize all the treasures in this vault.

As a crimson radiance shone out from his body, crimson flames blazed within his pupils, and the flames were blooming like a bright moon. The Nethermoon Saint Artifact also released a horrifying demonic radiance that allowed his aura to undergo a great boost.

This made everyone’s faces change because the Fire God General seemed to have restrained himself. If they weren’t in this vault, he would probably unleash an even greater power.

“I have long noticed that you’re not at the Profound Life Stage. But in the Black Tortoise Vault, you can only lie down on the ground!” Lin Yun’s eyes shone brightly, and he dashed forth.

When they clashed within the Black Tortoise Vault, one activated the Nethermoon Saint Armor, while the other relied on the empowerment of the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown. They instantly exchanged three moves, and they both took three steps back. Blood dripped down the Fire God General’s lips, and he was shocked while looking at the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown on Lin Yun’s head. As for Lin Yun, he raised his head and coldly looked at the Fire God General.

“Hmph!” Lin Yun didn’t let the Fire God General go so easily. Lightning began to crackle around his body while coldly looking at the Fire God General. When a terrifying aura swept out from the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown, Lin Yun dashed forth with an even faster speed.

As explosions echoed within the hall once more, the Fire God General threw out a mouthful of blood, and he was sent flying away. With just one move, the Fire God General was defeated, and he flew back before colliding against the stone pillar.

Ao Feng and Yan Cangming’s faces changed when they saw this scene and wanted to attack Lin Yun. But Lin Yun suddenly turned around and pushed a palm forth while enveloped in lightning. When a Golden-Purple Divine Dragon flew out, Ao Feng and Yan Cangming’s auras crumbled before they could even get close.

“KNEEL!” Lin Yun coldly roared, instantly forcing the two down on their knees with just one palm. Under his dragon aura, Ao Feng and Yan Cangming couldn’t put up resistance at all.

“The Golden-Purple Dragon Crown…” Everyone looked at Lin Yun with fear and rage, but they were powerless to do anything since the crown was too powerful.

“Does anyone still want to face me?” Lin Yun coldly looked around. “I’m not a mad killer, but don’t blame me for being ruthless if anyone wants to entangle me!”

When he finished, he clenched his fist from afar. This instantly made Ao Feng and Yan Cangming scream out in pain before they were sent flying away.

Lin Yun initially wanted to crush their heads, but the Nethermoon Saint Armors actually protected them. Even so, the two of them felt extremely uncomfortable. They were like livestock being lifted to the air, and fine cracks appeared on their Nethermoon Saint Armors.

With a gentle shove of his hand, Ao Feng and Yan Cangming were sent flying away. Seeing this, both demonic cultivators and holy land geniuses quickly ducked.

The Fire God General’s face was dark, and he had to soar to the sky to catch them both. When he landed on the ground. He gritted his teeth and threatened, “Lin Xiao, how dare you! Are you really not afraid that my Blood Moon Sect will kill you when we get out of the Black Tortoise Void Sea?!”

“You think I’d still dare to compete with you for the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown if I was afraid of your Blood Moon Sect?” Lin Yun said indifferently.

His words made the Fire God General’s face dark with reluctance filling his pupils. The surroundings also fell silent because no one dared to say a word about Lin Yun. But they couldn’t help feeling reluctant when the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown was in Lin Yun’s hands.

The Fire God General’s gaze became dim, and he sneered, “You’re really interesting. There’s no way the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown can make you invincible. Yu Wenxiu, how long are you still going to keep hiding?”

Everyone was stunned and wondered if Yu Wenxiu was here. But they soon figured it out because Yu Wenxiu was the first who dashed into the Black Thunder Saint Palace when Lin Yun fought with the Fire God General. So he should have been here a long time ago.

“Haha.” A peal of laughter came from a pillar. Yu Wenxiu took two steps forth, holding onto a bone flute in his hand. He smiled, “Lin Xiao, you can’t protect the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown by yourself. You’re arrogant, but don’t tell me you want to kill all of us here?”

Leaping down the pillar, Yu Wenxiu continued, “Don’t tell me you don’t have that capability. But do you have the guts to do it?”

Yu Wenxiu was obviously changing the concept, but his words were vicious, putting Lin Yun in a position against everyone. It was as if he was saying that Lin Yun would have to kill everyone here if he wanted to keep the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“As expected of Brother Yu, your method is still as low as before. I don’t need to kill anyone, and you guys can come at me if you want the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown. I’m curious to see who has the courage to do it!” Lin Yun smiled.

Even the Fire God General was defeated, so who else would dare to confront Lin Yun?

As the stalemate continued, Yu Wenxiu smiled, “I’m curious. How long can you wear the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown? You have yet to refine it, and you won’t be able to last long with your physique.”

“Why don’t you come and give it a try, then?” Lin Yun coldly looked at Yu Wenxiu.

“There’s no need to hurry.” Yu Wenxiu toyed around with the bone flute, and continued, “I roughly scanned the place earlier, and there are many treasures here. But there aren’t many Glory Saint Artifacts around, and the Black Thunder Saint Canon is nowhere to be seen. So the real Black Tortoise Vault might be this starry sky above us.”

Everyone’s faces changed when they heard that, and the Fire God General was surprised because Yu Wenxiu really knew a lot.

“But the secret to entering this Starry Sky Secret Realm might be in the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown. It’s fine if you want it, but you have to open the Starry Sky Secret Realm!” Yu Wenxiu said.

When he said that, everyone turned their unfriendly gazes to Lin Yun. Lin Yun was already the target of everyone, to begin with. So everyone’s hostility towards Lin Yun naturally rose along with Yu Wenxiu’s instigation.

Lin Yun had no fear in his gaze, and he said, “What Starry Sky Secret Realm? I have no idea what you’re talking about, but I have already made myself clear. There are many treasures here, and you guys can compete for them. But you’re also welcome to come after me as long as you can bear the price.”

Lin Yun had a strong stance, and this made many people feel reluctant.

Right then, a burst of laughter resounded. When Lin Yun turned his gaze over, he saw the white-clothed man and the woman appear.

“The Starry Sky Secret Realm isn’t something you guys can dip your hands into, so you guys can leave now.” The woman said, and her voice was unquestionable.

“Who are you?” The sudden appearance of the white-clothed man and woman shocked everyone.

“You want us to leave? I’m afraid you guys don’t have that ability in this Black Tortoise Vault.” Since Yu Wenxiu dared to threaten Lin Yun, he naturally had his confidence in doing so. He also roughly guessed that these two might be experts of the older generation. But so what?

“Let’s go together. These two people are together with Lin Yun, and they want to occupy this place for themselves!” Yu Wenxiu coldly smiled. Just when everyone fell into a dilemma, he was the first to unleash an attack.

Raising the bone flute to his lips, the two statues before the throne began to move as Yu Wenxiu blew his flute. A powerful ancient aura swept out from them, and they dashed forth with their halberts.

“What an ignorant junior…” The woman smiled and suddenly raised her hand to her lips before giving a gentle blow. As boundless petals flew out, everyone was sent flying away before they could even get close.

As flower petals swept out, even those who were standing further away were sent flying away. The white-clothed man merely swept his gaze, and his sword intent started gushing out as well, knocking away the flower petals targeted at the Heavenly Dao Sect’s disciples, and this made those disciples feel lingering fear.

When everyone fell to the ground, they threw out a mouthful of blood, and their faces became pale. They all suffered a huge blow, and standing back up was difficult for them.

The white-clothed man then flicked his finger and shattered the knees of the two statues, causing them to fall to the ground. No matter how Yu Wenxiu blew his flute, he couldn’t control the statues again.

This instantly enveloped everyone in fear because they had clearly unleashed their powers that far exceeded the Profound Life Stage, but they didn’t suffer any backlash. So how did they manage to do it?

This instantly made everyone in the hall look at the white-clothed man and woman in fear. As for Yu Wenxiu, the woman waved her hand and his bone flute fell in her hands. After briefly toying with it, she tossed it to the man wearing a bamboo hat, making the latter baffled.

Was this lady acquainted with him? The man wearing a bamboo hat was baffled, before he suddenly recalled the woman wanting to travel with him when they entered the Black Tortoise Void Sea.
