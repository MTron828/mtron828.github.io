Chapter 1938 - Secluded Disciple (2)

The Dragon Origin Great Saint handed the medal to Lin Yun with his right hand while stroking his beard with his left. He was confident Lin Yun could accept it and become his secluded disciple.

On the other hand, Lin Yun smiled bitterly, looking at the medal because he had no choice. Although he could leave and the Dragon Origin Great Saint wouldn’t do anything to him, he didn’t want to leave the Heavenly Dao Sect. He hadn’t retrieved the Solar Lunar Divine Rune nor excavated the secrets of the Emperor Sword.

He had just grasped the Astral Sword Intent and became the champion of the Di Group. If he left the Heavenly Dao Sect, he wouldn’t be able to find a place with a better environment. Most importantly, he didn’t seem to have any losses if he agreed.

Taking a deep breath, he asked, “Great Saint, will you keep your promise?”

The Dragon Origin Great Saint looked at Lin Yun with disdain, before he said, “I won’t even tell the Serene Dust Great Saint about it. Do you think I’m that old goat? I won’t bluff you, and I have never conned anyone before.”

He had never conned anyone before and was always the one being conned.

Hearing what the Dragon Origin Great Saint said, Lin Yun began to suspect if there was a story between the Dragon Origin Great Saint and the Serene Dust Great Saint. But he had little time to think and could only grasp the medal.

Seeing this, the Dragon Origin Great Saint smiled. The Radiant Sword Saint was smart, but he probably never expected that the Dragon Origin Great Saint would snatch his disciple. The Dragon Origin Great Saint wasn’t smart, and he didn’t think that the Radiant Sword Saint might’ve expected this scene by asking Lin Yun to come to the Heavenly Dao Sect.

“Ye Qingtian, show me your two saint physiques,” said the Dragon Origin Great Saint.

Lin Yun nodded and formed a seal as dragon runes of two colors appeared on his body. The golden-purple and blue-jade dragon runes both reached a number of a hundred thousand, and the dragon runes formed into two dragons that coiled around him. They were an Azure and Blue Dragon, each reaching ten feet. The Azure Dragon manipulated the thunderstorm with sword intent contained within its pupils, while the Blue Dragon’s pupils were filled with vitality.

The Dragon Origin Great Saint fell into deep thoughts, instantly noticing something. The Azure Dragon had perfectly fused with Lin Yun’s sword intent, while the Blue Dragon fused with the Divine Dragon Bone. They were both equals, it’s just that each of them had a different focus. He instantly noticed that Lin Yun wanted to merge the two saint physiques to form the Azure Dragon Divine Physique!

Even if the two saint physiques were powerful, they were only saint physiques and had no advantage when facing a divine physique. But divine physiques were rare because saint physiques were powerful enough, not to mention possessing two saint physiques.

When the Golden Era arrives, monstrous geniuses would appear, and two saint physiques would become lacking.

“How are you fusing them now?” The Dragon Origin Great Saint asked.

Lin Yun crossed his hands together and formed the Sovereign Dragon Seal. Under the Sovereign Dragon Seal, the blue-jade and golden-purple dragon runes began to fuse. The dragon aura given off by Lin Yun began to increase, and he had forcibly achieved the Azure Dragon Divine Physique.

When the Azure Dragon Divine Physique was formed, the aura released from Lin Yun increased, and he made a breakthrough. Lin Yun also grew taller, reaching two meters, and gave off a oppressive aura. He wouldn’t have any pressure even if he faced an opponent at the pinnacle of the Nirvana Stage now.

This surprised the Dragon Origin Great Saint because Lin Yun was simply a genius. The more he looked at Lin Yun, the more he was fond of him. The Radiant Sword Saint had taken in a good disciple, but this disciple now belonged to him.

But he maintained his composure and said in disdain, “That’s enough. Don’t bother embarrassing yourself; you can only last for half an incense of time. It’s still lacking.”

Lin Yun dismissed the Sovereign Dragon Seal and smiled, “Actually, I can only hold on for fifteen minutes. I only know the Golden Dragon, Silver Dragon, and Blue Dragon Seals of the Sovereign Dragon Seal.”

“Write down the Azure Dragon Saint Art and Blue Dragon Skybreaking Art. I’ll look into the ancient books and find a way for you,” the Dragon Origin Great Saint said. “You won’t last long, and you have barely touched the surface of the Azure Dragon Divine Physique. Was it taught to you by that old man?”

The corner of Lin Yun’s lips twitched, and he knew that the Dragon Origin Great Saint was doing it on purpose.

But Lin Yun maintained his patience and wrote down the two body-refining techniques.

The Dragon Origin Great Saint stood beside him and nodded, looking at the two body-refining techniques. When Lin Yun finished writing them, the Dragon Origin Great Saint smiled, “Nice handwriting.”

“My master taught me how,” Lin Yun smiled.

The Dragon Origin Great Saint’s face changed, and he said, “But it’s a pity that it doesn’t have any heroism of a man. You can leave now.”

The Dragon Origin Great Saint began to study the two body-refining techniques, unwilling to wait for another moment.

“Oh, the Saint Realm’s section of the Divine Sunchasing Art can be found in the Contribution Hall. You have obtained quite a bit of benefit as the champion of the Di Group, so don’t forget about that. You also have a chance to enter the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda, but don’t be in such a hurry to enter. I’ll bring you there once you’ve reached the Nirvana Stage.”

“Thank you, Master.” Lin Yun said, feeling warmth in his heart.

“Oh, right. Master, do you have True Dragon Saint Liquid?” Lin Yun asked before leaving. Since the Dragon Origin Great Saint was a body-refiner, he must have True Dragon Saint Liquid.

“Take a look at the medal I gave you and notice if there’s anything wrong with it,” the Dragon Origin Great Saint said.

When Lin Yun looked at the medal, the gold medal had a wisp of blood. The blood contained a powerful saint aura and ferocity. That was the Great Saint’s blood, and this alarmed Lin Yun as he quickly raised his head to look at the Dragon Origin Great Saint.

“Since you’re now my secluded disciple, you can naturally inherit my all. You can retrieve the treasures and contribution points I’ve left behind throughout the years,” the Dragon Origin Great Saint said without raising his head.

Lin Yun fell into a long silence, and the medal felt heavy. He merely cupped his hands before leaving.

After returning to the Indigo Thunder Peak, Lin Yun couldn’t even rest and was called to the main hall by the Indigo Thunder Peak Master.

The Indigo Thunder Peak Master smiled, “You’re here?”

Lin Yun had brought honor to the Indigo Thunder Peak by becoming the champion of the Di Group, and he was naturally happy since he was the peak master of the Indigo Thunder Peak.

“Yeah. I have just returned from the Dragon Origin Great Saint,” Lin Yun said.

“Ye Qingtian, these are the rewards as the champion of the Di Group.” The Indigo Thunder Peak Master smiled and took out five jade bottles. He tossed the jade bottles over and said, “These are Nirvana Pellets, and there are five hundred thousand in these bottles here.”

Lin Yun received the bottles with his face slightly changed because he didn’t expect the rewards to come so quickly. When he opened the bottles, a purple nirvana aura began gushing out, filling the hall with a purple mist.

The Indigo Thunder Peak Master enviously said, “This is the treatment of a genius. They’re the highest grade, the purple Nirvana Pellets. Close the bottles quickly.”

Lin Yun naturally recognized the purple Nirvana Pellets and quickly closed the bottles with a smile. He said, “Thank you, Peak Master.”

“You deserve them, and there’s no need to thank me. This is a Quasi-Saint Pellet, but don’t open it.” The Indigo Thunder Peak Master sent a box over and sighed, “This is what the older generation’s saint disciple of the Tian Group is fighting for.”

“Quasi-Saint Pellet? Does it mean that you can immediately become a Quasi-Saint upon refining it?” Lin Yun asked curiously.

The Indigo Thunder Peak Master shook his head and replied, “It’s not easy to become a Quasi-Saint. This pellet can only increase your odds. If you can’t use it, you can exchange it for other treasures or wait till you’re at the Quasi-Saint Realm before using it. The saint aura and saint dao contained within the pellet are precious.”

Lin Yun decided to leave it for Lil’ Red. He was still far from the Quasi-Saint Realm, while Lil’ Red was already at the Nirvana Stage.

“You now have five hundred thousand contribution points, and you’ll know more about them when you go to the Contribution Hall,” the Indigo Thunder Peak Master Said. His expression suddenly became serious, and he said, “Aside from that, you also have an opportunity to enter the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda.”

Just as the Dragon Origin Great Saint said, Lin Yun replied, “I’m not in a hurry to enter there. The Dragon Origin Great Saint said he’ll bring me there.”

The Indigo Thunder Peak Master smiled, “Good. If the Dragon Origin Great Saint brings you there, you might be able to climb a few more levels. Ye Qingtian, you have a good master and must cherish him well.”

Lin Yun awkwardly smiled after hearing what the Indigo Thunder Peak Master said.

“Alright. I’ll no longer hold you, and you can leave now,” the Indigo Thunder Peak Master smiled.

“Peak Master, I actually don’t need so many Nirvana Pellets,” Lin Yun said. “I want to leave behind two bottles for the fellow disciples in Indigo Thunder Peak.”

“Why?” The Indigo Thunder Peak Master asked.

“Well, I’m the Indigo Thunder Peak Master’s chief disciple, and consider it compensation for what I did in the past,” Lin Yun replied. Ye Qingtian was a coward when facing others but a bully against fellow disciples in Indigo Thunder Peak. He noticed that the character of the Indigo Thunder Peak’s disciples was pretty good, and he wanted to do something good on behalf of Ye Qingtian.

“I don’t think there’s a need for that. You don’t know how many resources are needed to reach the ninth transformation of the Nirvana Stage,” the Indigo Thunder Peak Master said with a grave expression.

“Do you have to be so serious? I’ll stop acting anymore, then,” Lin Yun smiled.

“Keep the Nirvana Pellets, and don’t bother putting on an act.” The Indigo Thunder Peak Master smiled, taking a sip of his tea.

Lin Yun cleared his throat and took out the Great Saint’s disciple medal. He said, “I’ll be honest, then. I have become the Dragon Origin Great Saint’s secluded disciple.”VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

The Indigo Thunder Peak Master wasn’t bothered when he first saw the medal, but his face changed when he saw the blood on the medal. The cup in his hand fell to the ground, and he was dumbfounded.

As a peak master, he naturally knew what a secluded disciple represented. This meant that Ye Qingtian had become the Dragon Origin Great Saint’s successor, and Ye Qingtian would inherit everything when the Dragon Origin Great Saint passes away.

A Saint Elder would have many disciples, but they would only have one secluded disciple in their lifetime. So they were naturally careful about who they choose.

The Indigo Thunder Peak Master was shocked because this meant that Lin Yun’s position was even higher than his now. After all, a Great Saint’s secluded disciple was equivalent to half the position of a Saint Elder. A long time later, the Indigo Thunder Peak Master looked at Lin Yun while gritting his teeth, “Ye Qingtian, you really know how to put on an act!”
