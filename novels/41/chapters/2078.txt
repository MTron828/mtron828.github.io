Chapter 2079: More Troubles (1)

When Feng Yu let go of Feng Wuji, the latter descended to the lake along with four figures, bringing the unconscious and heavily injured Feng Shaoyu away.

Lin Yun’s last attack might be horrifying, but the Heavenly Dragon Seal protected Feng Shaoyu’s life.

Feng Wuji didn’t restrain his aura on purpose. So as he gave off a powerful saint aura, it strongly pressured Lin Yun. Lin Yun instantly knew that Feng Wuji wanted to teach him a lesson.

Lin Yun brought out his sword intent to barely resist the saint aura as he cupped his fists together, “I pay my respects to the manor master.”

At the same time, Lin Yun also returned the Heavenly Dragon Seal with his gaze occasionally on it. But before he could take more looks at it, Feng Wuji seized the Heavenly Dragon Seal.

“This is a treasure of the Hidden Sword Manor. Even if you take it away, you can’t use it without the technique,” Feng Wuji looked at Lin Yun.

Don’t be so sure about that. I’m probably the only one who heard the eight ominous beasts acknowledging me as ‘Lord’.?Lin Yun recollected his thoughts and said, “Manor Master, please grant me the sword.”

His goal here was the Sovereign Saint Sword, Cauldron. Since Feng Wuji placed great importance on the Heavenly Dragon Seal, he didn’t want to create any more trouble.

Feng Wuji didn’t hesitate to push his palm forth and shattered the giant sword, revealing a sword enveloped in golden flames that looked like a dazzling sun when it appeared.

Before the dazzling radiance it gave off, it made many people squint their eyes while looking at it.

“It’s really in there!” Lin Yun raised his head and saw that the sword really was hidden within the giant sword. Even when sheathed, it gave off such a powerful sword aura.

“This is the Cauldron Sword?”

“The method for forging Sovereign Saint Swords was long lost. With the Cauldron Sword being borrowed, I wonder if the Hidden Sword Manor has any more Sovereign Saint Swords.” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“I heard that the method for forging the Sovereign Saint Sword wasn’t lost, but it requires a Divine Spiritualist to forge it. But Divine Spiritualists are extinct within the Kunlun Realm.”

“This sword is extraordinary and definitely not an ordinary Sovereign Saint Sword. After all, it can reach the height of a Divine Artifact after combining with the Firmament Sword!” Countless people’s gazes fell onto the Cauldron Sword with envy filling their pupils.

After all, that was a Sovereign Saint Sword they were talking about. If a force had a Sovereign Saint Sword, they could immediately give birth to a top-tiered expert because the full power of a Sovereign Saint Sword could be brought out in the hands of a Great Saint.

With the Cauldron Sword, if the user had a sufficient foundation in sword dao, one could barely face an Emperor Realm expert.

“Such a good sword, but it’s a pity that it fell into the hands of an outsider…” Zhao Wuji looked at the Cauldron Sword with envy reflected in his eyes.

At the palace, many geniuses shared the same look as Zhao Wuji because what Zhao Wuji said was the thoughts of those from the Sword Alliance.

“What’s the matter? Do you have an opinion about it?” A cold voice came that made Zhao Wuji tremble. When he raised his head, he discovered that the voice had come from the woman standing beside Feng Wuji earlier, and her cold gaze made Zhao Wuji feel a chill down his spine.

This made Zhao Wuji fearful, and he immediately stepped back. Even so, he was furious in his heart and began to wonder about the identity of this woman. She looked like she was from the Hidden Sword Manor and yet she was helping an outsider right from the beginning.

This instantly made him wonder what charm Ye Qingtian possessed. Even if Zhao Wuji was furious, he did not dare to show it on his face.

Feng Yu snorted, “Don’t you dare have any bad ideas. Otherwise, I won’t let you go.”

Zhao Wuji squinted his eyes and didn’t dare to look at Feng Yu directly because she had seen through his thoughts.

After Feng Wuji retrieved the Cauldron Sword, the saint radiance that the sword gave off slowly entered the sword, which made the sword look ordinary.

“This sword is called Cauldron. Upon being drawn out, it will create a phenomenon of a divine cauldron, and that cauldron can release the sun’s radiance. I’ve heard that a portion of the materials used for this sword came from the sun's core.” Feng Wuji looked at the sword and wasn’t willing to let it go. Reluctance was filling his eyes

Lin Yun was feeling anxious in his heart, but he was too embarrassed to urge Feng Wuji.

Feng Wuji looked at the sword for a long time before he handed it over, and Lin Yun didn’t hesitate to seize it. Lin Yun could feel an obstruction when he held onto it because Feng Wuji didn’t let go of it.

Lin Yun raised his head and said, “Manor Master, what do you mean by this? I have already returned the seal.”

“Please don’t misunderstand,” Feng Wuji said. “Can you tell me how you controlled the eight ominous beasts? This is a secret of my Feng Clan. Does it mean you also know a technique to control the seal?”

“Sure,” Lin Yun replied.

“Oh?” Feng Wuji’s eyes lit up.

“If you loan me the seal for a year, I will tell you the secret a year later,” Lin Yun smiled.

.

Feng Wuji’s face changed when he heard that. But just when he was about to lose his temper, he noticed the confidence on Ye Qingtian’s face. This instantly made him wonder if there were secrets about the Heavenly Dragon Seal that even he didn’t know about.

Lin Yun already thought of how to fool Feng Wuji and said, “Aside from the four natural constellations, there are still sovereign constellations. There are a hundred sovereign constellations, but aside from a hundred sovereign constellations, there is another sovereign constellation born in ancient times. It’s a secret that not many people know about.”

Lin Yun’s words made Feng Wuji uneasy, wondering if that constellation was related to the eight ominous beasts. But how could the Hidden Sword Manor not know about it if there was such a sovereign constellation? But if there wasn’t such a sovereign constellation, how could Ye Qingtian control the eight ominous beasts?

“You’re right. This constellation can control the eight ominous beasts, and the eight ominous beasts are only the tip of the iceberg.” Lin Yun saw through Feng Wuji’s thoughts and seized the sword just when Feng Wuji was feeling doubtful.

“Thanks for the sword,” Lin Yun smiled.
