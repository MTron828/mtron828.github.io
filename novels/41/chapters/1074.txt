Chapter 1075 - Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon

Lin Yun was in a hazy space between reality and illusion. When he opened his eyes, he noticed that the injury on his chest left behind by the Imperial Feather Realm son had disappeared. “Where am I? Shouldn’t I be at the bottom of the lake?”

He heard a voice before his consciousness completely faded and when he reopened his eyes, he was here. When he raised his head, he saw a tree in the distance decorated with many Iris Flowers. It was a familiar that helped Lin Yun realize he was in his subconscious.

When the demonic spirit tried to take over his body, he was also forced into this space. Lin Yun looked around, but the ice phoenix was nowhere to be seen. He still remembered the first time he saw the ice phoenix and the great shock it brought him. It even caught the demonic spirit by surprise and destroyed it with just a single glance. If it wasn’t for the ice phoenix, his body might have been taken over by the demonic spirit.

“Senior, is that you?” Lin Yun asked after looking around.

“Hmph, if it wasn’t me, how else would you get here?” The familiar feminine voice sounded out in the space, causing Lin Yun to turn his head around. He could see a ball of light and the back of the figure that emitted a terrifying and ancient aura.

“S-senior…” Lin Yun’s voice trembled.

“Mortal, why aren’t you kneeling before me?” asked the figure.

The words made Lin Yun lock his brows as he replied, “I don’t even kneel to heaven.”

“Hmph, what heaven and earth? Heaven and earth weren't even around when I was born. I’ve just awoken and I need a servant…” said the figure with disdain.

Lin Yun was shocked when he heard that. Just where did this ice phoenix come from? Did it really exist before heaven and earth were created?

“I'm 18 years old, one year for each era. I was born before heaven and earth, and I won’t die even if heaven and earth are destroyed. I’m the Divine Phoenix Clan’s Supreme Heavenly Slaughter Empress of Four Seas, Eight Barrens, 36 Heavens, and 72 Earths. So why aren’t you kneeling? In ancient times, even gods and devils didn't dare to look at me directly.”

Lin Yun was even more shocked when he heard that. The ice phoenix had already broken free of the era restraints and was even more ancient than legends. But when Lin Yun saw her true appearance, he was shocked. She was an adorable little girl trying her best to look cold and disdainful.

“Hmph, why aren’t you kneeling when you see me? Do you think I won’t crush you with just one finger?” The little girl put her arms on her waist, but Lin Yun couldn’t sense any hostility coming from her. Instead, she was giving off a weak aura.

Lin Yun walked forward as he fell into deep thoughts. Seeing this, the little girl spoke coldly, “Hmph. If you take another step forth, I’ll make you suffer a fate worse than death! Don’t try to push it. Even the divine dragon would be afraid when I get furious…”

But before she could finish speaking, Lin Yun lifted her from the ground.

“ARGGGGH! PUT ME DOWN OR I’LL REALLY BECOME FURIOUS!” The little girl began to wave her hands around and looked at Lin Yun, “Put me down quickly! I’m the Divine Phoenix Clan’s…”

Despite her protests, Lin Yun didn’t listen. “You’re the Four Seas, Eight Barrens, 36 Heavens, and 72 Earth’s Supreme Heavenly Slaughter Empress, right?”

Hearing that, the little girl wore a prideful expression and said, “Hmph! Since you know my name, why aren’t you putting me down? I don’t like being lifted up!”

“So our Supreme Heavenly Slaughter Empress has been lifted up in the past?” Lin Yun smiled at the little girl’s boasts.

When the little girl heard that, her face turned red, “T-t-that was from a servant of mine in the past!”

“Lass, speak properly,” said Lin Yun after gently smacking her butt.

“Y-y-you dare to smack this empress’s butt?! I’m the Divine Phoenix Clan’s four seas, eight barrens…” But before she could finish, Lin Yun gave her another smack.”

“I’m born before heaven and earth…”

PAK!

“This empress…”

PAK! PAK! PAK!

“Sob, sob! I’m sowwie! Pwut me down, don’t smuack my butt anymore!” Lin Yun only placed her down after she knew she was in the wrong. But after she broke free of his demonic claws, she immediately returned to her prideful self and pouted her lips.

“Now, can you tell me who you really are?” Lin Yun asked.

“Hmph, I told you. I’m born before heaven and earth, and I won’t die even if heaven and earth are destroyed. I’m the Divine Phoenix Clan’s Four Seas, Eight Barrens, 36 Heavens, and 72 Earth’s Supreme Heavenly Slaughter Empress!” The little girl raised her head proudly.

In the beginning, Lin Yun didn’t believe her but he had no choice but to believe her now. She was probably the indigo ice phoenix he saw before. It seemed like she was a variant of the ice phoenix clan and was captured by the Iris Sword Saint in the past. Meaning, she was the link between the Iris Sword Sutra and the sword box he carried. Additionally, she seemed weak despite extinguishing the demonic spirit with just a glance. It seemed like she had a special innate talent.

“Your name is too long. I’ll call you Lil’ Purple from now on,” said Lin Yun.

“No way! That’s a terrible name. There’s no way this empress is using that name,” said the little girl with disdain.

“What about Boo then? Since you love boasting so much,” replied Lin Yun.

The little girl’s face blushed when she heard that and said, “I think Lil’ Purple sounds better…”

Lin Yun smiled as he asked, “Lil’ Purple, I’m at the bottom of the lake right now, right? How long can I stay alive for?”

“About an hour. You’re too weak. Someone like the Imperial Feather Realm Son wouldn’t even stand a chance against me in the past,” said Lil’ Purple with her face filled with disdain.

“Why don’t you go out and kill him then?” Lin Yun replied.

“Hmph, how can I possibly lower myself to his level!” Lil’ Purple said.

Although it hadn’t been long since they interacted with each other, Lin Yun knew that it was because she was in a weakened state right now. She might have been strong in the past, but Lin Yun still had to rely on himself. Thinking about the Azure Dragon True Bone getting taken away from him, his face gradually turned cold, “How did the Imperial Feather Realm Son manage to take the Azure Dragon True Bone from me when there’s a divine rune on it?”

Hearing that, Lil’ Purple wore a proud expression and smiled, “There’s nothing this empress doesn’t know of.”

“Speak,” said Lin Yun. Would she die if she didn’t boast this much?

“That’s because he also has a complete divine rune in his heart with an origin not any weaker than your Azure Dragon True Bone,” said Lil’ Purple.

“I see. He has really hidden himself deeply,” said Lin Yun with his eyes flashing. It looks like not all the realm sons were dumbasses like the Nether Divinity and Imperial Diagram Realm Sons.

“Oh, why didn’t the cloth that the Azure Dragon Lord bestowed me activate? I’m clearly facing a life and death situation.” Lin Yun couldn’t figure out why the cloth didn't appear when he was in danger.

“That Azure Dragon Lord still has some ability. But didn’t you hear what he said? The cloth is for you to deal with those old geezers. It will probably activate when you’re facing an opponent two realms above you. If you’re fighting those in the same generation, it won’t appear even if you’re killed,” replied Lil’ Purple.

Her words made sense to Lin Yun. If he was killed by someone of the same generation, then it was probably because he was too weak and wasn’t worthy of the Azure Dragon Lord’s investment. But there was nothing he could do now that the Azure Dragon True Bone was taken. So once his vitality truly disappeared, he would die. Yue Weiwei and Lil’ Red must be feeling anxious…

“So there’s no solution to this situation,” said Lin Yun with a grave expression.

“You won’t die with me around,” she replied.

“Do you have a solution?” he asked. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“I don’t want to die even if you want to.” Lil’ Purple looked at Lin Yun with disdain before she continued, “I activated your Azure Dragon Saint Art before you fainted, so you can recover in an hour. But now that you’ve lost the Azure Dragon True Bone, there’s no way you can defeat the Imperial Feather Realm Son. If you practiced the Iris Sword Sutra I left behind, you wouldn’t find yourself in this situation.”

“You’re the one who left the Iris Sword Sutra behind?” Lin Yun was confused. Didn’t that belong to the Iris Sword Saint?

“Of course. I’m the one who gave it to that brat back then. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to make a name for himself in ancient times. After all, he slayed deities while in the Saint Realm. But the Iris Sword Sutra is only part of the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon, and it only has the Heavenly Soul Realm portion. If you want the complete one, you’ll have to depend on me,” said Lil’ Purple.

“The Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon?” He already knew that the Iris Sword Sutra was incomplete, but he didn’t think that its real name was the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon.

Luckily, he had this little girl with him. The Iris Sword Saint probably arranged all of this on purpose. Perhaps when he reached the sixteenth stage in the Iris Sword Sutra, the ice phoenix might be able to leave his subconscious space. In this short period of time, Lin Yun thought about many things.

“The Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon is naturally powerful, but you won’t unleash its full power without music. If you can touch the surface of its power, it’ll be easy for you to suppress that Imperial Feather Realm Son. At the very least, your attainments in the sword will improve and you might even make a breakthrough in your sword intent if your Iris Sword Sutra went up by another stage,” said Lil’ Purple.

“So do you want to learn? I’m lacking a servant and my shoulders need a massage.” Lil’ Purple rubbed her shoulders as she pretended to ache.

Lin Yun simply lifted his head and smiled, “I’m no servant. It’s a funny coincidence, I just happen to lack a daughter.”

When Lil’ Purple heard that, she immediately flared up as she couldn’t allow her dignity as an empress to be provoked. She puffed up her cheeks and roared, “Let me go! I hate being lifted up the most! I’m the Divine Phoenix Clan’s…”

Lin Yun simply smacked her butt again as she spouted nonsense.

“I’m born before heaven and earth! I’m really becoming furious now!”

PAK!

“I'm the Supreme Heavenly Slaughter Empress!”

PAK! PAK! PAK!

“I’m sowwie! Pwut me down! I’ll teach you…” It didn’t take long for Lil’ Purple to submit after a few spanks.
