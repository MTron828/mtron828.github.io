Chapter 982 - God of Wealth

Looking at the mysterious woman, Yu Haotian’s eyes flashed coldly. He didn’t know if she appeared on purpose or if it was just a coincidence. But her appearance and words calmed Lin Yun down.

Yu Haotian had a long feud with Lin Yun and knew what Lin Yun cared about the most. This meant that he knew how to enrage Lin Yun if he pushed the right buttons. But all of his work went down the drain.

Feng Xuanyi’s party was disappointed because they wanted to use this opportunity to kill Lin Yun.

“Hehe. Let’s just watch for now. Your idea was good, but don’t get eaten by using yourself as bait. That brat is arrogant and he won’t hold back for long. Just wait until you enter the Azure Dragon Palace and you can watch him die!” A demonic spirit’s voice sounded out in Yu Haotian’s mind.

Although Yu Haotian had no changes in his expression, his heart was filled with joy, “Senior, you’re awake?”

After the demonic spirit took over his body to fight Lin Yun, it fell asleep. The demonic spirit was strong, which gave Yu Haotian confidence for the Azure Dragon Palace.

“I’ve been awake for a while now. I’m satisfied with your performance and how you’ve improved. Looks like I was right to make you my successor,” said the demonic spirit. It had been in hiding, waiting for the right moment to speak to Yu Haotian.

“You think that it’s dangerous for me to be the bait? I don’t think so. I’ve gotten a lot stronger. Plus, I have the Glorymoon Spirit and many other inheritances. I obtained three thousand divine astral pellets and I even obtained a powerful treasure.” Yu Haotian wasn’t satisfied with the demonic spirit’s assessment.

After a brief silence, the demonic spirit replied, “There’s something weird about this brat that not even I can see through. We have to let someone probe his strength first. He had obtained your fortune in the Profound Amber Realm, which isn’t the end of the world, but isn’t the Glorysun Spirit with him?”

“That’s right. He has it. But that’s not bad, right?” Yu Haotian was baffled.

“Haha, what do you know? He might have obtained your fortune, but you also managed to make a breakthrough every time he defeated you. Without him, do you think you would be this strong? He’s the fish you’re nurturing to eat. Not only is he your food, but he’s also your god of wealth. When you obtain the Glorysun Spirit, you’ll know what kind of opportunity he brings you,” smiled the demonic spirit.

Now that Yu Haotian thought about it, it was true. Although he was defeated by Lin Yun every single time, he also became stronger. If not, he wouldn’t have his current strength. Technically speaking, he really had to thank Lin Yun. As for the god of wealth part, Yu Haotian was pretty fond of the title that the demonic spirit gave Lin Yun.

He couldn’t help but become emotional whenever he thought about all of Lin Yun’s fortunes and treasures going to him. He could only imagine how entertaining Lin Yun’s expression would be.

“You’ll know the benefits when the Glorysun and Glorymoon Spirits merge together. As for now, you don’t have to worry about him. Since he failed to kill you three times, he won’t have the same opportunities,” said the demonic spirit. Yu Haotian had lost to Lin Yun twice in the Profound Amber Realm and once in the Heavenly Path. But he managed to survive the ordeals and became stronger.

The more Yu Haotian thought about it, the brighter his eyes became. He survived three times and obtained the Glorymoon Spirit along with countless divine astral pellets. Most importantly, the treasure he obtained was something that even the seven heads would come after. It also happened to be his strongest trump card.

“Ice beauty, what a coincidence seeing you here,” smiled Luo Chen. He guessed that Pei Xue was here for a while and only appeared after Lin Yun was provoked. Then again, her appearance also diverted the attention of Feng Xuanyi’s party away from Lin Yun.

Luo Chen had sensed Lin Yun’s killing intent spiraling out of control, but it disappeared the moment Pei Xue appeared. It seemed like Lin Yun had an irreconcilable feud with Lin Yun.

Donned in purple clothes, Pei Xue smiled charmingly, “Oh really?”

Sensing the charm emitted from Pei Xue, Luo Chen calmed himself down with a bitter smile.

“He really surprised me though. He wasn’t this strong when we first met. Honestly, I’m a little curious about him. It’s actually unbelievable that he managed to grow so strong so quickly. I even heard that Feng Xuanyi suffered in his hands…” Pei Xue had no intention of avoiding the topic of Lin Yun.

Hearing that, Luo Chen’s expression became grave, “Indeed. If all goes well, he will probably surprise everyone at the end of the Heavenly Path.”

“Oh?” Pei Xue was surprised when she heard that evaluation. After all, the final battle wasn’t limited to the Azure Dragon Region. Luo Chen should know how terrifying the top-tier geniuses from the other regions were. It wouldn’t be easy for Lin Yun to shine, especially with the ten war realms joining. The foundation of the war realms wasn’t inferior to the Kunlun Realm in any way. Clearly, they were a threat.

Luo Chen replied seriously, “He’s not strong right now, but he does have that potential.”

Suddenly, a fluctuation spread out in the space as the dense starlight gradually weakened. At the same time, the palaces were beginning to look clearer.

“Time to get going!” Luo Chen’s eyes blazed because he had waited a long time for the Azure Dragon Palace.

At this moment, everyone began to charge forward. However, it wasn’t easy to enter the Azure Dragon Palace due to the terrifying power of the vortex. Many people were shredded to pieces when they entered and the vortex was filled with screams. Clearly, the Azure Dragon Palace had caused many people to lose their rationale.

When Lin Yun looked at the vortex, his eyes began to ripple. It looked like many people had underestimated the danger. He cleared his mind and made a plan. Upon entering the Azure Dragon Palace, there was a high possibility that Feng Xuanyi’s party or Yu Haotian would attack him. It would be worse if all five of them ganged up on him.

Four of the seven heads and Yu Haotian was a formation that would make many people’s scalps tingle. It greatly pressured Lin Yun. After all, he didn’t have any helpers. Luo Chen’s party might have a relationship with him, but it wasn’t deep enough for them to help him. As for Pei Xue, he didn’t know if she was a friend or an enemy. He could only rely on Lil’ Red and his sword.

“It’s going to be fine.” Taking a deep breath, Lin Yun stopped hesitating. With his sword and Lil’ Red as companions, there was no place he didn’t dare to barge into. Plus, he was determined to compete for the opportunity above fortune. WIth a flash, Lin Yun charged into the starry sky. With his current strength, he only needed to be cautious when entering the Azure Dragon Palace.

It didn’t take long for Lin Yun to maneuver through the obstacles and enter the vortex of starlight. At this moment, he could see majestic palaces surrounding a plaza covered with countless runes.

He also saw a sky filled with boundless lightning that struck every single person that entered.

While everyone felt uneasy about the lightning, a thunderstorm began to cover the sky with two bright stars appearing out of the blue. Then, the starlight created two huge holes in the clouds as an invisible pressure descended down.

“What’s going on?” Some people had fear in their eyes when they saw this happening.

As for Lin Yun, his eyes flashed. He knew that he wasn’t looking at two stars, but the eyes of an azure dragon. Not long after, a gigantic head appeared in the sky that looked down on the world coldly.
