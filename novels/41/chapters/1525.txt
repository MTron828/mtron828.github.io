Chapter 1526 - Where Did You Get Your Confidence From?

While Lin Yun and Lil’ Purple were searching for the body-refining technique of the Blue Dragon’s lineage, there was an undercurrent flowing in the outside world. As a blade ray soared into the sky in the Heavenly Astral Pavilion’s direction, a powerful aura swept out that rumbled like thunder.

When Tian Jue opened his eyes, his eyes shone brightly. He had reached the Dragon Pulse Realm.

“Tian Jue made a breakthrough!”

“It’s no wonder why he’s the first envoy. The phenomenon created by him is a little terrifying!”

“His foundation is too terrifying. Even if he didn’t manage to condense dragon origin, his aura is a little too terrifying.” Everyone was shocked while directing their gazes towards Tian Jue’s direction.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“How is it?” The Samsara Edict Realm elder of the Heavenly Astral Pavilion asked with his brows furrowed, looking at Tian Jue. He found it a pity because Tian Jue had waited for so long. Since he was in such a hurry to make a breakthrough, this meant that he wouldn’t be able to condense dragon origin in the first-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm.

Although Tian Jue had become a lot stronger, it was a loss when looking at it in the long term. If Tian Jue went into seclusion for ten days to half a month, it was certain that he could condense dragon origin in the first-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm.

“I nearly succeeded… but it doesn’t matter, anyways.” Tian Jue replied without any regret in his pupils.

“Elder Chang, has anyone come out from the astral realm?” Tian Jue looked at the entrance of the Dragon Remnant Astral Realm, and his face was terrifyingly dark.

“No one as of now. What happened inside?” The Samsara Edict Realm elder was named Chang Cheng. He was curious about what happened in the astral realm.

Tian Jue’s face changed before he turned to look at An Liuyan while transmitting his voice to Chang Cheng. When Chang Cheng heard what Tian Jue said, his face was ugly because he couldn’t accept what Tian Jue said and inwardly shook his head.

Tian Jue was the first envoy and had a high position in the Heavenly Astral Pavilion. There was a high possibility that he might become the young lord. So Chang Cheng would naturally respect his opinion. But what Tian Jue said was too incredible.

“Hmph!” Tian Jue snorted. “Don’t interfere later. I’ll take revenge with my own hands!”

His heart was filled with hatred and he was gradually running out of patience while waiting for Lin Yun. He wanted to step on him to take revenge for what happened in the trial tower.

Right then, a few auras swept out, followed by various phenomena. The Seven Absolute Palace’s Qin Yue, Blood Rain Pavilion’s Pei An, Demonfiend Sect’s Yan Xuan, and Hundred Ghost Gate’s Chen Kui reached the Dragon Pulse Realm.

The phenomena created by them dazzled everyone’s eyes. There were crimson sword rays, blood rain, demonic blade rays, and ghosts wreaking havoc.

As four figures soared into the sky, the auras that they were releasing reached terrifying heights. They didn’t manage to condense dragon origin in the first-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, but the aura they were releasing still left many people stunned.

Through years of accumulation, their hard work at the Elysium Core Realm had been excavated when they reached the Dragon Pulse Realm. It was hard to believe how strong they would become if they were willing to wait for another half a month. At the same time, everyone couldn’t help feeling puzzled.

“What’s going on? Something doesn’t seem to be right for several chief disciples to make a breakthrough at the same time.”

“They’re indeed stronger, but they suffered a bigger loss of being unable to condense dragon origin in the first-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm.”

“It’s normal for an ordinary genius to be unable to condense dragon origin in the first-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. But to monstrous geniuses like them, this is a little too unbelievable.”

“I’m afraid that they’re waiting for someone!” Everyone could sense an undercurrent. But just while everyone was being astonished, a dazzling demonic light shone as brightly as a vast sun, accompanied by a draconic roar that sounded like a demonic dragon.

Shortly after, a black demonic dragon appeared, flickering with dazzling light. This phenomenon shocked many people, and geniuses under the Dragon Pulse Realm could feel fear rising in their hearts.

“Murong Chen!” An Liuyan sighed beside Xiao Yun.

That phenomenon attracted everyone’s attention in the asteroid belt, including the Samsara Edict Realm experts of the various demonic sects. None of them could conceal the shock in their eyes because they didn’t have such a terrifying phenomenon when they reached the Dragon Pulse Realm.

“Ling Qianye won’t be inferior to him if he’s here!” Three Samsara Edict Realm experts of the Blood Rain Pavilion sighed. The chief disciples of the other demonic sects were all out except for Ling Qianye. But the three elders were confident that the Blue Dragon Bone definitely fell into Ling Qianye’s hands.

“That’s where you’re wrong, Third Elder. Since Ling Qianye obtained the Blue Dragon Bone, the phenomenon created by his breakthrough will only be more shocking.”

“That’s right!” The leader of the three elders smiled. “Don’t look down on the Blue Dragon Bone. Since Qianye received this opportunity, he naturally will be able to compete for the divine son position. Our position in the Blood Moon Sect will rise at that time.”

When the demonic dragon dove like a comet, it entered Murong Chen’s body. As demonic light shone out from Murong Chen, a Netherflower with sixteen petals slowly bloomed behind him. But when he opened his eyes, everything disappeared except the light flickering in his pupils. He had concealed everything and looked no different from an ordinary Dragon Pulse Realm expert.

“Weird, what’s going on? Why did the phenomenon disappear all of a sudden…?”

“Yeah. Did he manage to condense dragon origin?”

“But the Netherflower behind him is a little terrifying.” Everyone in the surroundings exclaimed, but only the middle-aged man named Qiu Qiong nodded his head with a smile.

As Murong Chen slowly stood up, he nodded, “Elder Qiu, did anything happen?”

“No.” Qiu Qiong said.

“Let’s just wait, then!” Murong Chen calmly said, but his tone was filled with a terrifying killing aura that left several Elysium Core Realm disciples stunned. They had no idea what was going on for Murong Chen to have such a strong killing intent.

Suddenly, a vibrating noise resounded from the entrance of the Dragon Remnant Astral Realm. This commotion instantly attracted everyone’s attention and a person flew out, landing in the asteroid belt.

“He’s out!”

“Ling Qianye?!”

“Senior Brother Ling!” The Blood Moon Sect’s disciples wanted to cheer, but they were soon dumbfounded because the person that came out was donned in azure clothes, carrying a sword box behind him and a purple mark on his forehead

“Lin…” An Liuyan wanted to say something, but she soon shut her mouth. But her eyes radiated with excitement because Lin Yun was alive, and she finally felt relieved.

But she knew this wasn’t the time to meet Lin Yun. She began to feel worried, and the excitement in her pupils soon turned into concern. At this moment, she only hoped that Lin Yun could leave.

This was all captured by Tian Jue, making him inwardly snicker. He hated Lin Yun, and what happened in the trial tower was a great humiliation. But when he saw him, he suddenly calmed down and wasn’t in a hurry to make a move.

Everyone’s attention was on Lin Yun at this moment, but Lin Yun didn’t panic when he sensed the gazes of Samara Edict Realm experts directed at him. This made him inwardly snicker, but he didn’t head to the Heavenly Astral Pavilion’s region, nor did he look at An Liuyan and Xiao Yun. This was because he didn’t want to land those two into trouble.

“What should we do now?” Lil’ Purple asked.

“Let’s just pretend that nothing happened.” Lin Yun replied, wanting to leave with no intentions of staying behind. They couldn’t find the body-refining technique of the Blue Dragon’s lineage, but he had obtained almost everything he could. Since there was no longer a purpose for him to stay behind, he naturally had to leave.

But it wasn’t easy for him to leave. Five figures suddenly soared into the sky. They were the Seven Absolute Palace’s Qin Yue, Blood Rain Pavilion’s Pei An, Demonfiend Sect’s Yan Xuan, Hundred Ghost Gate’s Chen Kui, and Netherworld Hall’s Murong Chen.

The five were emitting auras in the Dragon Pulse Realm, with rolled-up paintings behind them. As long as they wanted, they could open up their constellations.

“Lin Tian, you’re really daring! After obtaining the Blue Dragon Bone, you want to leave just like that?” Murong Chen mocked. His voice wasn’t loud, but everyone heard it.

Everyone burst into an uproar when they heard what Murong Chen said. This person has obtained the Blue Dragon Bone? How is this possible?! Where’s Ling Qianye, then? Does this mean that the chief disciples of the seven demonic sects all lost to this person?

Everyone was shocked when they heard that, and they could feel a chill run down their spines. A person that no one has heard of has defeated the seven chief disciples?

“Hand over the Blue Dragon Bone, or you can only dream about leaving here today.” Chen Kui of the Hundred Beast Gate stared at Lin Yun.

“What if I refuse?” Lin Yun replied indifferently.

As mockery flashed through the pupils of Qin Yue, he snickered, “You’re really naive. Do you think this is still the trial tower? Raise your head and look around. We have our demonic sects standing behind us, and it’s just a word from us to have you killed. Where did you get the confidence to reject us from?”

“From the fact that I’m the disciple of the Radiant Sword Saint. From the fact that I’m the heaven-direct disciple of the Sword Sect’s Divine Firmament Peak. If you dare to try and suppress me with your forces, you are also challenging the Sword Sect. Where do I get my confidence from? Is the name ‘Radiant Sword Saint’ enough?” Lin Yun coldly said.

When he was done speaking, the chief disciples were stumped, especially Chen Kui, whose face had turned red; he never expected that. Everyone in the surroundings also fell silent. It was as though Lin Yun had suppressed the seven demonic sects.
