Chapter 1175 - Life-Death Painting?

When a terrifying sword aura swept out from Lin Yun’s residence, it instantly enveloped the entire Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. The entire sect was in shock as they looked in the direction of Lin Yun’s residence.

Ye Ziling was at her residence with Wang Yuruo looking towards Lin Yun’s residence. Shock filled Wang Yuruo’s eyes as she said, “Senior Sister, what’s going on?”

Earlier on, she could sense an immense sword aura and she nearly lost grip of her sword. But fortunately, Ye Ziling was beside her and used her sky sword intent to resist that immense sword aura. Otherwise, her sword would have flown towards Lin Yun’s residence just like the other swords.

“Holy Spirit!” Ye Ziling muttered with her eyes shining brightly.

She had never encountered such a monstrous person that was in the same generation as her, even in the Radiant Snow Saint Clan. At the very least, she didn’t think that anyone could compete with Lin Yun in the Empyrean Realm, not to mention that Lin Yun wasn’t even twenty.

“Holy Spirit? Aren’t Azure Birds the holy spirits of the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords?” Wang Yuruo asked with her head tilted to the side.

“Naturally not. The Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords was something that had shaken the entire Eastern Desolation in the past. The real holy spirit and the Azure Birds aren’t the same, and they’re two different sword techniques,” said Ye Ziling.

“That’s great!” Wang Yuruo rejoiced and smiled, “Senior Brother Yun hasn’t even reached the Empyrean Realm. When he reaches the Empyrean Realm, we’ll definitely be able to win the championship!”

“All you think about is your Senior Brother Lin,” smiled Ye Ziling.

“Hehe, since when? But Senior Brother Lin is really handsome. Senior Sister, why don’t you consider getting together with him?” Wang Yuruo chuckled.

“How will you feel if he and I get together?” Ye Ziling looked at Wang Yuruo with a smile.

“I-I don’t know. But I know that I’ll be happy to see the two of you together.” Wang Yuruo said. She was good-natured, but she was also naive.

“Silly lass, you won’t be happy,” said Ye Ziling while she caressed Wang Yuruo’s head. A brief moment later, she continued, “We won’t get together, we’re just good friends. At times, it’s harder to find a friend than finding someone you like.”

Wang Yuruo nodded her head in confusion and replied, “No way, I’ll be happy because I can also be together with you guys.”

Hearing that, Ye Ziling burst into a chuckle before she flicked on Wang Yuruo’s forehead, “Cut your nonsense or I’ll spank you.” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Hehe. Don’t flick my forehead! But is Senior Brother Lin really going to leave with us?” Wang Yuruo said with her tone filled with expectation. It had been a few days since she last saw Lin Yun, so the thought of Lin Yun brought a smile to her face.

“Yeah.” Ye Ziling nodded his head with a smile. No matter what, it was a great surprise that Lin Yun had grasped the genuine holy spirit of the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords. Now, she believed that the Suspend King Palace, Azure Thunder Monastery, and the Thousand Crane Pavilion would be shocked.

Her face became cold as she thought about it because the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect had been enduring the other sects for a long time. It was time for the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect to win back their honor, which was the only reason why she stayed in the sect for so long. Her dream was to fight for honor with her sword in her hand.

She had been staying here since the age of seven, so the sect had become her home. Naturally, she had a great love for this place.

In Lin Yun’s residence, Lil’ Purple returned riding on Lil’ Red who was in the warhorse form. When she looked at the shattered spiritual array and the sword mound, she was so shocked that she couldn’t cover her mouth.

“What’s going on? I only left for three days, and you’ve already started to smash the place?” Lil’ Purple glared at Lin Yun because even her little courtyard was gone.

“I couldn’t control it,” smiled Lin Yun because he didn’t even use his sword intent. Who knew that the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords were so powerful, especially the last sword?

The last sword even tore heaven apart as it made boundless starlight merge into a sword ray that he could wield. As for the holy spirit from the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords, it had gone beyond Lin Yun’s expectations. When Lin Yun brought out the azure longsword holy spirit, the sword cocoon in the center of his brows had grown bigger.

“Should I make a breakthrough to the Empyrean Realm now?” Lin Yun asked, looking at Lil’ Purple.

He was already familiar with the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm, and he was no longer as ignorant as he was back then. Since he had the leaves of the Divine Blood Fruit, he had a way to match the foundation of others that had decades more time than he did.

Lil’ Purple fell into deep thought and said, “It’s best for you to wait. There’s no need for you to be in such a hurry. But since you’ve promised Ye Ziling, it won’t harm you if you make a breakthrough now.”

“Got it.” Lin Yun replied. There was no risk for him to make a breakthrough now, and the only flaw would be that he couldn’t excavate all the benefits from reaching the limit of the Heavenly Soul Realm. It was something that he could accept since he had already promised Ye Ziling.

“So, what did you do for the past few days?” Lil’ Purple asked.

“I reached the manifestation stage in the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords. I also found out that the true holy spirit of the Fleeting Cloud 13 Swords is actually a sword…” Lin Yun told Lil’ Purple about his progress so far.

Hearing that, Lil’ Purple was surprised. “Lin Yun, your talent in the sword is too terrifying. I thought that you only had good enough looks to be my servant, but it looks like you have some talent after all.”

Seeing that Lil’ Purple was boasting again, Lin Yun ignored her because he was in a good mood. Otherwise, he would really teach her a lesson. Then, he changed the topic so Lil’ Purple wouldn’t keep boasting, “What about you? Where have you been for the past few days?”

Lil’ Purple really fell for it as she looked at Lil’ Red and nudged her lips, “This empress nearly traveled the entire Profound Azure Prefecture because of him. But we finally found a monarch demonic beast with dragon bloodline. It will be enough for Lil’ Red to reach the Astral Stage.”

When she said that, Lil’ Red couldn’t help scratching its head because Lil’ Purple had helped it greatly the past few days.

“Oh, right. Why are you looking for this empress?” Lil’ Purple asked.

Lin Yun told her everything about the Southern Emperor’s tomb, including the three treasures and the Profound Wither Key. When Lil’ Purple heard that, she was so shocked that she didn’t address herself as an empress for once. “Holy shit…”

But a brief moment later, she regained her composure and said, “Looks like I’ve really underestimated the nine emperors. I didn’t think that one Southern Emperor would actually have those three treasures. It’s a little too much to call them shrimps, but they still can’t be compared to this empress.”

“Here.” Lin Yun smiled before handing the rose painting to Lil’ Purple.

However, Lil’ Purple didn’t open it. Merely grabbing it caused her face to change as she threw the painting back to Lin Yun, “You’re smart to not open it because you might not see anything good with your current mindset.”

“Is it really the Life-Death Painting that contains Hell’s Gate? Does hell really exist in this world?” Lin Yun was shocked that Lil’ Purple didn’t dare to open it. After all, Lil’ Purple was fearless.

“There are many things you don’t know about. Back then when the Iris Sword Saint rose to fame, the great battle took place in Hell,” said Lil’ Purple while she cast a disdainful glance at Lin Yun. But the moment she mentioned the Iris Sword Saint, her tone became filled with contempt, “Tsk, tsk, tsk. You have no idea how proud that brat was to slay a deity while being only in the Saint Realm.”

Lil’ Purple had mentioned the deed of the Iris Sword Saint slaying a deity while he was in the Saint Realm, but Lin Yun had no idea what that meant. After all, saints and deities were both beyond his reach. Storing the painting, Lin Yun asked, “Do you want to come with me when the Profound Wither Island opens?”

“Well, since you put it that way, I’ll go with you. Since the Profound Wither Saint is the successor of this Southern Emperor, I want to see what’s so impressive about this Southern Emperor,” said Lil’ Purple.

But Lin Yun smiled when he heard that because Lil’ Purple was akin to a safety net for him. “Come on. Go back into the sword box. We have to meet that old geezer now.”

Lil’ Purple was briefly stunned when she heard that before she remembered that today was the day Lin Yun had to meet the sect master. And she was also curious what the sect master required of Lin Yun.
