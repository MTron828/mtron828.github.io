Chapter 1659 – Yu Qingfeng (2)

In the Profound Wither Sea, at the pinnacle of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s snowy mountain, two people were seated looking in a direction. In that direction, they could see saint glory shining. One of them was the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s sect master, Jian Jingtian. After making a breakthrough and reaching the nirvana stage, Jian Jingtian’s appearance was restored to his youth.

Beside him was his junior brother, Feng Jue. After Feng Jue recovered from his injuries, he was sent to the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect by Mu Chuan to accompany Jian Jingtian. But rather than accompanying Jian Jingtian, Mu Chuan mainly sent him here so that Jian Jingtian could teach Feng Jue.

“I wonder how our eldest senior brother and second senior sister are doing…” Feng Jue sighed before sneaking a peek at Jian Jingtian.

Jian Jingtian had fallen into a long silence, looking towards the distance without saying a single word. Feng Jue wanted to change the topic, but Jian Jingtian had no intention of bothering him.

He had roughly sensed something, but he couldn’t see anything. He asked Jian Jingtian, but the latter didn’t say anything and only looked into the distance. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“C-C-Cold…” Right then, a person climbed up the snowy mountain. This place was unique, and those beneath the Dragon Pulse Realm's cultivation would have difficulty resisting the cold temperature here.

Jiang Lichen smiled and cupped his hands together, “This disciple pays his respect to Master and Martial Uncle.”

“Didn’t I tell you to train in the God Realm Altar? Why are you here?” Jian Jingtian asked with his brows furrowed.

The altar behind the back mountain of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect that Lin Yun discovered was a rare realm, and Jian Jingtian had been letting Jiang Lichen train there.

Jiang Lichen didn’t dare to look straight into Jian Jingtian’s eyes and smiled, “I’m worried about Junior Brother Lin and the rest. They had been in the Ancient Barren Battlefield for so long, so there should be news about them now, right? Master, do you know anything?”

The entire Ancient Barren Domain knew that the Ancient Barren Battlefield had opened. Although Jiang Lichen couldn’t go, he knew Lin Yun and Ye Ziling would go there. So he couldn’t help being worried for them.

Jian Jingtian’s face didn’t change when he heard that, but Feng Jue was briefly stunned before his face drastically changed.

“Fuck!” Feng Jue cursed and wanted to leave immediately. He finally came to his senses. The light shining in the distance was clearly a battle between saints, and it must definitely be because of Lin Yun.

“Come back.” Jian Jingtian pressed Feng Jue down with a hand and coldly said, “Do you think you can do anything if you’re there?”

Feng Jue immediately lost it when he heard what Jian Jingtian said. He grabbed Jian Jingtian’s collar and roared, “I know that I’m useless and can’t participate in a battle between Saints. What are you doing here, then? That’s a battle between saints. Our master might be implicated because of it. Jian Jingtian, you can really hold it in. If you’re so useful, why don’t you go there!”

But Jian Jingtian merely looked at Feng Jue, who was roaring from the bottom of his heart. Sometime later, when Feng Jue finally calmed down, he knew he had spoken the wrong words. If Jian Jingtian could go, he would’ve gone there long ago.

Jian Jingtian swore to his sword heart two decades ago that he wouldn’t leave the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect for his lifetime and wouldn’t be able to leave if he couldn’t get through this heart tribulation. He knew that Jian Jingtian must be aching in his heart, but there was nothing he could do about it.

On the other hand, Jiang Lichen was alarmed when he heard that and began to worry for Lin Yun.

A person was seated on a mountain in a barren land with pure starlight shining. Sitting there, he gave off a feeling as though he could pluck the stars from the sky with a stretch of his hand.

But as that person sat on the mountain while cultivating, he seemed to shine even brighter than the stars in the sky. Suddenly, he opened his eyes and looked in a direction before shaking his head and breathing a sigh.

After he sighed, he no longer had any hesitation in his pupils and stood up, picking up the sword beside him. He then appeared ten thousand miles away in the next moment. In the Divine Dragon Empire, only one swordsman had such grace, the Sword Emperor Yu Qingfeng.

But Yu Qingfeng finally came to a stop as two people appeared before him. One was dressed in white, and one was dressed in black, both were drinking wine. The white-robed person smiled, “White doesn’t drink, and the black doesn’t kill. Yu Qingfeng, it has been a long time since we last met. Are you going somewhere to drink or to kill?”

To speak to Yu Qingfeng in such a manner, while being donned in white and black, respectively, they could only be the White and Black Emperors of the Nine Emperors.

Yu Qingfeng smiled, “I’m not going to drink, nor am I going to kill. You both knew that if I wanted, one sword is all it would require for me to resolve everything. Since I have decided to make a trip personally, I don’t want to swing that sword and make things difficult for her.”

“Why get involved? It has been many years since you last made your appearance.” The black-robed youth said indifferently.

“I was the one who conquered the Ancient Barren Domain back then.” Yu Qingfeng shook his head.

“Ha!” A disdainful laughter resounded that made the stars in the sky dim. When a flaming figure appeared, it looked at Yu Qingfeng and smiled, “Stop pretending. You didn’t even care about the Skysolute City you created, so why will you care about the Ancient Barren Domain? If you were a little more motivated back then, you would’ve taken the seat after Brother Southern left.”

This person was also one of the Nine Emperors, the Flame Emperor.

“Looks like I can’t keep my pretense anymore.” Yu Qingfeng rubbed his nose upon hearing that.

Right then, a blade ray tore through the horizon with boundless killing intent descending onto this plane. A black-robed figure suddenly appeared. This person was standing on a blade as he looked at Yu Qingfeng with disdain, “Yu Qingfeng, you won’t be able to leave here today. You can give it a try if you don’t believe it!”

This person was the Blade Emperor, Chen Zilong.

Yu Qingfeng’s pupils flashed with disdain. He knew the Blade Emperor would come since the Flame Emperor was here. Keeping his smile, his right hand fell onto his sword’s hilt, “Do you guys want to force me to draw my sword?”

When Yu Qingfeng’s hand fell onto his sword hilt, the entire world became quiet, so quiet that everyone could hear the time flowing.

As time flowed, none of them were confident that they could survive after Yu Qingfeng drew his sword, even if the four were among the Nine Emperors. This was because Yu Qingfeng’s sword was faster than time.

At this moment, regardless of Chen Zilong, the White, Black, and Flame Emperors, they all became nervous.

When the wind blew again, Yu Qingfeng loosened his grip on his sword and wore a brilliant smile, “I was just joking!”

Hearing that, the four emperors immediately breathed out a sigh of relief. They even had beads of sweat rolling down their forehead because no one could imagine the pressure that they were under.

The Flame Emperor smiled, “You’re still the same as before…”

But before the Flame Emperor could finish, Yu Qingfeng’s hand grabbed onto his sword again. With a smile, Yu Qingfeng said, “Sorry about that. I lied to you guys.”

In the end, Yu Qingfeng ultimately drew his sword.
