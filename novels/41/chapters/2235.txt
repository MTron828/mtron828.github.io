Chapter 2236 - My Name! (2)

Lin Yun was alarmed, with shock filled in his eyes. If what the Asura Dove King said was true, how many Saint Realm demonic corpses did the Demonspirit Clan possess now? A thousand? Ten thousand? He couldn’t imagine the numbers.

“Hehe.” The Asura Dove King was inwardly happy because he finally saw the shock on Lin Yun’s face.

“Last question.” Lin Yun suppressed the doubts in his heart, and asked, “Do you have any information about a girl, or do you know who does?”

Lin Yun even described Su Ziyao’s appearance and temperament to the Asura Dove King. Seeing that the latter couldn’t understand, he even used his finger as a brush to draw Su Ziyao’s appearance for him.

When he drew Su Ziyao’s appearance, the Asura Dove King was shocked but soon concealed it in his heart.

But Lin Yun naturally detected this as he squinted, “It looks like you do know something.”

“Why don’t you take a guess?” The Asura Dove King smiled as he squinted.

“Speak, and I’ll let you use the Othershore Flower,” Lin Yun said.

“Haha!” The Asura Dove King smiled and changed the topic, “I heard that regardless of good or bad, human cultivators have things they are concerned about, such as love and their lovers. This kind of thing is even more important than their lives. Brat, am I right?”

“You’re not wrong,” Lin Yun replied honestly.

“So… is she someone you love, then?” The Asura Dove King sneered as he pointed at the portrait.

“That’s right,” Lin Yun replied.

“Ha!” The Asura Dove King was confident now as he shifted a boulder before sitting on it, taking his Rahu Sword out. Holding the sword, he said, “You might seem to be maintaining your composure, but you’re still too young and have revealed your weakness. The moment someone has a weakness, they wouldn’t be able to pretend to be ferocious anymore.”

When Lin Yun drew Su Ziyao’s portrait earlier, the affection in his eyes couldn’t bluff the Asura Dove King.

But Lin Yun didn’t speak as he looked at the Asura Dove King.

“Your name is Lin Yun, right?” The Asura Dove King spun his sword, feeling that he had grabbed Lin Yun’s weakness. He asked, “It’s not too much for me to call you Lil’ Lin, right?”

“Sure. If you have any information, this Othershore Flower…” Lin Yun said.

But the Asura Dove King waved his hand and smiled, “Let’s not talk about the Othershore Flower for now. Give me a kowtow, and I might tell you once I’m satisfied.”

He had his emotions pent up for so long, and naturally became arrogant, feeling that he had a tight grip on Lin Yun’s weakness.

“You’re courting death!” Before Lin Yun could reply, the Lil’ Red flew into a rage.

“You silly cat, don’t you know how much your master is concerned about this woman? I’m afraid that only I know of her information in the Heavenly Void,” the Asura Dove King smiled.

“Big Brother, give the word, and I’ll kill him!” Lil’ Red said furiously.

Lin Yun stopped Lil’ Red and calmly asked, “Are you sure you know Su Ziyao’s location?”Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“What do you think?” The Asura Dove King smiled.

Lin Yun fell into a brief silence before he looked at the Rahu Sword and changed the topic, “That’s the Rahu Sword, and I have heard of it before.”

The Asura Dove King was concerned about this sword. He had grabbed the tip of the hilt and smiled, “This used to be a Sovereign Saint Sword, but it was heavily damaged… I spent a few hundred years and only returned it to a Fivespirit Glory Saint Artifact. I could easily handle you by relying on this sword if I wasn't heavily injured.”

The moment he said that, he became furious, with a hint of ferocity flashing across his eyes. He coldly said, “Why aren’t you on your knees? Do you think that I don’t have any temper? Do you believe I can determine her life and death with a single word?”

“Big Brother!” Lil’ Red became anxious.

Lil’ Purple also wore a grave expression because she knew Lin Yun well, and he would do anything for Su Ziyao. If she was trapped, Lin Yun would do the same. This was the kind of person Lin Yun was.

“There’s no need to hurry. Can I take a look at that sword?” Lin Yun sat on the boulder as he looked down on the Asura Dove King.

The Asura Dove King was briefly stunned before he rolled his eyes and said, “Sure, but don’t blame me for not reminding you that this is a demonic sword.”

This demonic sword could devour the vitality of enemies and the master alike. This was also the beloved sword of the Asura Dove King, and he had spent a few hundred years to recover it to a Fivespirit Glory Saint Artifact. He was confident that if Lin Yun dared to grab a hold of the sword, he would instantly be controlled by the Rahu Sword. At that time, Lin Yun would be under his control.

The Asura Dove King acted to conceal his true intentions, and said, “You might be a prodigy swordsman, but you’re still lacking in comparison to this sword.”

“Hand it over.” Lin Yun reached out, putting the Othershore Flower back.

The Asura Dove King was unhappy with Lin Yun’s attitude but still handed the Rahu Sword over. He looked with unease as Lin Yun held onto the sword scabbard, but he wasn’t in a hurry to grab onto the sword hilt. This instantly made him nervous as he looked at Lin Yun’s right hand.

Lin Yun could tell what the Asura Dove King was thinking with a glance, but he wasn’t in a hurry to grab onto the sword hilt.

“As a Blood Crow, you won’t be able to understand the love of humans. But you have things you cherish,” Lin Yun slowly said as he held onto the Rahu Sword’s hilt under Asura Dove King’s anticipating gaze.

This instantly made the Asura Dove King feel relieved, and he squinted, “How does it feel? Terrible, right? You can’t draw it out nor let go of it, and your vitality is constantly being drained.”

He could no longer suppress his excitement and stood up, laughing, “Flower Burial, you’ll go down on your knees even if you don’t want to! Hahahah!”

But as he laughed, he soon felt that something wasn’t right because Lin Yun was too calm with no emotions on his face. Just when he felt uncertain, Lin Yun drew out the Rahu Sword that released a dazzling radiance, accompanied by a violet gale, flashing lightning, and sharp screams.

The Asura Dove King was dumbfounded because he could sense that the Rahu Sword’s artifact spirit was screaming and begging. He had never seen the Rahu Sword in this state before, which made him widen his eyes in disbelief. But that wasn’t the most frightening thing. An explosion suddenly emerged from within the Rahu Sword.

It sounded like a star had been shattered as a black radiance appeared from the sword. This was a sign that a glory spirit had shattered, reducing the Rahu Sword from a Fivespirit Glory Saint Artifact to a Fourspirit Glory Saint Artifact.

But that wasn’t all, another explosion soon came from the Rahu Sword, signifying the destruction of another glory spirit.

The Asura Dove King couldn’t hold it any longer because the sword was his beloved treasure. He immediately fell to his knees and sobbed, “Flower Burial, please stop! I apologize for what I did earlier!”

As another glory spirit shattered from within the Rahu Sword, lightning ripped across the sky with a powerful gale in the surroundings that illuminated Lin Yun’s indifferent expression. As his hair fluttered in the wind, this moment felt eternal.

Lin Yun’s gaze turned cold as he looked at the Asura Dove King with golden light shining in his eyes. As he utilized his Quasi-Divine Light Sword Intent, the sword intent left in the Asura Dove King’s body formed into swords. As thousands of swords stabbed out of the Asura Dove King’s body, they looked like a blooming flower.

The Asura Dove King couldn’t even respond before he was torn into thousands of pieces. But the Asura Dove King still wasn’t dead because a Saint Lord wouldn’t die so easily, and Lin Yun didn’t want him dead.

“Flower Burial, please stop. I’m in the wrong…” The Asura Dove King let out a scream of despair.

But Lin Yun looked at the Asura Dove King from above. His left hand fell onto the sword tip as gale and lightning rumbled through his ears, and the infamous Rahu Sword was shattered into pieces just like that and the powerful explosion even created spatial cracks in the surrounding space.

When Lin Yun looked around, the fragments that flew out were frozen around him as he looked at the Asura Dove King coldly, “You know my name, and you dare to act so presumptuously? Asura Dove King, that’s quite the courage you have there.”

Lin Yun’s voice was accompanied by rumbling thunder in Asura Dove King’s ears, which made his soul tremble with fear. The Asura Dove King was genuinely afraid this time because he had never seen such a terrifying young man before!
