Chapter 2425 - Heavenly Dragon’s Authority

Lin Yun didn’t open the two paintings left by the Iris Sword Saint. He stowed the Bodhi Seed and began to comprehend the sword he used. That sword was profound, and he discovered that he had forgotten many things when he looked back around.

He muttered, “I should be like the Iris Sword Saint and Bodhi tree. It’s too lacking if I can only rely on Yin-Yang Sword and Nirvana Sword Art. The two sword techniques can be used through the Eternal Daos, but I can’t control them well. If I use them, my saint energy will be consumed rapidly. So I must use the two canons to create a sword technique before observing Nirvana and Yin-Yang.”

He soon made up his mind and said, “Let’s start with the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon.”

He hadn’t rest for a moment ever since he came to the Azure Sky Realm, but had been consolidating his cultivation. He had long reached the pinnacle of the twelfth stage in the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon, with the cauldron entirely under his control.

“Let’s start with the Heavenly Dragon.” The Heavenly Dragon within his violet palace began to wander through his meridians, before it poured into the Flower Burial Sword through his arm, along with boundless sword energy.

As the Flower Burial Sword shone brightly, the Heavenly Dragon was engraved on one side, and this surprised Lin Yun, “Mhm?”

After the Heavenly Dragon entered the sword, he felt that he had grasped the Heavenly Dragon’s authority, which was the control of wind, rain, lightning, and thunder. This authority was so great that his hand began to tremble as he started losing control. In the critical moment, he used the Divine Dragon Sovereign Physique before the sword stopped shaking. But the accumulated sword aura and dragon’s roar left him with a lingering fear.

“Wind.” With a thought, a powerful gale swept out. Holding onto the Flower Burial Sword, he waved it around and muttered, “This is interesting.”

He immediately sensed the surrounding wind sweeping out like a tidal wave, and it looked like he was controlling an entire army when he waved the sword around. Suddenly, Lin Yun made a move and waved his hand. The Flower Burial Sword, which was sent seven mountains in a distance away, was pulled up from the ground.

This left Lin Yun dumbfounded. He might be able to accomplish something similar with his strength, but he was using the power of the Heavenly Dragon’s authority now.

“Rain!” Lin Yun muttered as the rain began pouring down and became heavy with a thought.

“This is magical.” Lin Yun was surprised at this scene. He raised his sword to the sky, and said, ”Thunder!”

Thunderclouds began to gather from the surroundings, enveloping the sky. As the clouds began to rumble, thunder roared that would make heaven and earth tremble. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Lightning!” Lin Yun raised his sword and golden lightning began to descend. The thunderclouds began to compress and formed into a black vortex. When he raised his sword again, the lightning descended like a tribulation, with space shattering like a mirror, leaving everyone who witnessed this dumbfounded.

“This is the Heavenly Dragon’s authority... It’s no wonder why they say that the Heavenly Dragon is the lord of all dragons and has such a position in the Kunlun Realm.” Lin Yun squinted, then said, “I can be called the Heavenly Dragon Lord now.”

After the Blue Dragon Record, he was given the title of Heavenly Dragon Lord, but he now deserved that title. With a flick, the thunderstorm created by the Heavenly Dragon’s authority gradually faded. When everything faded away, Lin Yun began comprehending the Heavenly Dragon Sword on the cliff.

He could also control the Heavenly Dragon in the past. Now that his eighth-stage sword intent reached complete mastery along with the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon, practicing it again felt like he was undergoing a rebirth. In just an hour, Lin Yun created the Heavenly Dragon Thirteen Swords with the Heavenly Dragon’s authority as the foundation.

When he thrust the last sword forth, a dragon’s roar echoed, tearing the sky apart and summoning the Azure Dragon Constellation. When the Sovereign Constellation appeared, the power of the Heavenly Dragon Thirteen Swords increased and became even more perfect.

“The Heavenly Dragon can summon the Azure Dragon Constellation. I wonder if the Divine Phoenix can summon the Vermilion Bird Constellation...” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with excitement on his face. He finally knew the benefits of a blank piece of paper.

If he hadn’t severed the Bodhi Seed, he wouldn’t have been able to reach this far, no matter how much he tried. Just as he had imagined, the Divine Phoenix could summon the Vermilion Bird Constellation. The Heavenly Dragon Thirteen Swords produced the Heavenly Dragon Sword Aura, while the Divine Phoenix Nine Swords produces the Divine Phoenix Sword Aura. If they were combined, they would form into a whole new Dragon-Phoenix Sword.

When he used the Dragon-Phoenix Sword, the front side of the sword had the Heavenly Dragon imprinted on it, while the other side had the Divine Phoenix imprinted. When the two combined, the Azure Dragon Constellation would turn into the sky while the Vermilion Bird Constellation became the earth.

Coincidentally, the Divine Solar Lunar Fist had something similar, with a golden crow as heaven and a silver phoenix as earth. But the power of this sword technique was much stronger in comparison. When Lin Yun divided himself into two, he swung a powerful sword aura that intertwined, forming the ultimate technique of the Dragon-Phoenix Sword—Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilation Slash!

“A blank piece of paper is easier to draw on.” Lin Yun was excited, looking at the power of his attack. Now that he was a blank paper, he could draw whatever he wanted.

“Just the Heavenly Dragon Thirteen Swords alone is stronger than the Divine Firefly Sword. If the Heavenly Dragon and Divine Phoenix combine... I’m afraid that it has broken through the restrictions of a dragon spirit martial technique.” Lin Yun began to ponder about the grade of the Dragon-Phoenix Sword. He felt this sword technique was comparable to a divine spirit martial technique.

In the Kunlun Realm, martial techniques were divided into saint spirit, ghost spirit, dragon spirit, and divine spirit martial techniques. Dragon spirit martial techniques were already the strongest martial techniques of each clan, such as the Great Profound Sword Canon. There weren’t many divine spirit martial techniques in the world.

Since the Heavenly Path was severed, divine spirit martial techniques couldn’t allow you to become a deity and could only be considered a powerful martial technique. There was only one divine spirit martial technique Lin Yun had on him, which was the Qilin Sword Canon that was left behind by the Qilin Sword Immortal. But since the grade was too high, he could only practice it after becoming a Saint Sovereign.

The Divine Dragon Empire, Eight Imperial Clans, and some ancient forces should have divine spirit martial techniques. Lin Yun analyzed. The Kunlun Realm was an Ancestral Realm in the past, so there must be divine spirit martial techniques.

“The Divine Phoenix Nine Swords came from the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon, but it has far surpassed the grade of the sword canon... Even if it’s not an actual divine spirit martial technique, it shouldn’t be inferior,” Lin Yun muttered to himself. “If I practice the Qilin Sword Canon in the future, I will have a divine spirit martial technique as a foundation, and the Dragon-Phoenix Sword can become even more terrifying.”

Lin Yun’s eyesight had been completely opened now. Even if he was only twenty-eight, he now had the temperament of a grandmaster. He briefly rested before he began practicing the Great Profound Sword Canon.

Since it was missing two stages, he couldn’t reach complete mastery of it, which made it lacking when compared to the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon. It was a regret, and he could only comprehend the Great Profound Sword Canon and roughly look at the changes in the peaks.

Just the Dragon-Phoenix Sword was enough since it allowed his swordsmanship to become much stronger. Ever since he severed the Bodhi Seed, he knew that too much wasn’t necessarily beneficial, and just the Dragon-Phoenix Sword was enough for him to comprehend for a long time.

When dawn came, Lin Yun opened his eyes and his Bright Sun Sword Intent improved. This time, he placed his attention on the two paintings. Compared to the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon, these two were the main events, since they contained profundity on how he should control the Eternals with his sword.

He flicked his finger and the two paintings opened up. With a glance, Lin Yun could sense a terrifying power that made him take a few steps back. The two paintings were two flowers, looking boundless, wanting to blow his mind apart

Taking a few more glances, Lin Yun took a few more steps back and was filled with lingering fear when he regained his footing.

“These are the genuine eternal daos, and I have only grasped the surface of them,” Lin Yun said with a grave expression. His Yin-Yang Dao and Nirvana Dao couldn’t even be considered entry-level, and he probably couldn’t reach entry-level in two days.

Lin Yun instantly had a gauge with a glance, and the Iris Sword Saint must have had a deeper reason to give him the two paintings. He soon figured it out. The two paintings were meant to perfect the Yin-Yang Sword and Nirvana Sword Art. By the time he perfects the two sword techniques, he should be able to find a way to reach entry-level and won’t take the wrong path.

If he went on the wrong path, it would become worse as he carried on cultivating. But if he was on the right path, even a gentle push was an improvement.

Lin Yun soon figured out a way and executed the secret technique of the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon, splitting himself into two and entering the two paintings.

Far away, the Iris Sword Saint and Azure Sky God Lord naturally saw this. The Iris Sword Saint said, “How reckless. Eternal Daos are profound, and yet he wants to comprehend two at once?”

The Azure Sky God Lord smiled, “He’s confident in himself. He made multiple breakthroughs in the Iris Sword Sutra you left behind. The current Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon doesn’t have any of your shadows in it.”

“I didn’t create the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon, but only perfecting it slightly,” the Iris Sword Saint said.

The Azure Sky God Lord smiled, “You’re really stubborn. I have never seen a sword technique capable of summoning two Sovereign Constellations, and you have to admit that you’re inferior than him at his age.”

The Iris Sword Saint turned to look at the cauldron, and coldly said, “Hmph, it’s okay as a fancy trick. Ultimately, he still has to rely on the Firmament Saint Cloth.”

The refinement of the Firmament Saint Cloth wasn’t smooth. It was one of Kunlun Realm’s ten divine artifacts and held a great significance to the Dragon’s Gate. But it was too heavily damaged back then, and he could only try to lower the grade to ensure that it could be perfectly used by Lin Yun, allowing him to confront Great Saints without paying any price, and this was a test of the Iris Sword Saint’s techniques.
