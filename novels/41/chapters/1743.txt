Chapter 1744 – I’m Unconvinced!

Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon Saint Physique became berserk under his torrential killing intent. In his path, a thunderstorm appeared as a hundred thousand dragon runes converged towards his palm, and he arrived before Qin Hao in the next second.

“Mhm?!” Qin Hao was shocked and wondered if Lin Yun had gone insane. Not only did Lin Yun interfere in a fight, but he even used martial dao?

Everyone was shocked because they never expected Lin Xiao to be so insane. When he let out a roar, the hundred thousand dragon runes manifested into a hundred-foot long azure dragon. As the azure dragon merged with his fist, his fist was the azure dragon’s head, and his punch released a dragon’s roar. Before his punch even arrived, the strings on Qin Hao’s zither began to snap.

When Lin Yun’s punch landed on Qin Hao’s chest, nine dragon pulses appeared behind the latter to withstand this attack. But this attack was too strong, and Qin Hao was sent flying away. When he fell to the ground, he still had lightning flickering over the surface of his body.

Enduring the flickering lightning, Qin Hao let out a roar to repel the lightning from his body with his dragon origin.

After Lin Yun sent Qin Hao flying away, he returned to Yue Weiwei’s side. When Lin Yun came to Yue Weiwei’s side, his rage burned once more when he saw Yue Weiwei’s injuries. He asked, “Weiwei, why are you so silly?”

“Because I wanted to help you become first on the Nirvana Banquet.” Yue Weiwei smiled.

“You go down first and rest. Leave this to me. I realized my mistake, and I shouldn’t have lied to myself. I won’t let you down in this lifetime.” Lin Yun said with heartache.

Yue Weiwei’s eyes became watery, and all the grievances in her heart gushed out. Under the fluctuation of her emotions, she even threw out a mouthful of blood, her face becoming pale. Her aura weakened, and her mental energy was already exhausted through the multiple battles.

“Weiwei!” Lin Yun became anxious and held her into his embrace. He even used his right hand to probe Yue Weiwei’s pulse through her wrist.

“Hehe. Weiwei is fine. I used the sealed power, so I’m a little exhausted. You don’t have to worry about me. I will take care of my injuries.” A brilliant smile appeared on Yue Weiwei’s face.

When Lin Yun looked at Yue Weiwei’s forehead, the crimson mark on her forehead gradually faded away. Recalling how her mental energy was significantly boosted when she fought Hua Hongyu, Lin Yun instantly understood what was happening.

He carried Yue Weiwei down the stage and came to Yan Tianchen, “Senior Brother, I’ll have to trouble you to take care of Yue Weiwei.”

Yan Tianchen nodded his head. After Lin Yun lightly nodded, he turned around and appeared on the Nirvana Stage with a step. When his gaze fell on Qin Hao, Lin Yun roared, “Qin Hao, you only know how to bully a woman? Get your ass up on the stage and fight me!”

His words shocked everyone because Lin Yun was too arrogant. Lin Yun was only at the seventh-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, while Qin Hao was a holy land genius at the ninth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. No matter how they looked at it, they didn’t think Lin Yun was on the same level as Qin Hao, regardless of whether they competed in music or martial dao.

When Qin Hao recovered his vitality and heard Lin Yun’s words, he slowly opened his eyes. Upon opening his eyes, a cold light flashed across his pupils, with a mocking smile on his lips. He was so ruthless to Yue Weiwei because he wanted to lure Lin Yun out.

Since Lin Yun came out, it was time for them to resolve their grudges. But just when Qin Hao was about to speak, a person coldly said, “Lin Xiao, we also have to resolve the grudge between us!”

This voice came from Li Yuxi, the most popular candidate in this Nirvana Banquet. He was worried he wouldn’t have a chance if Qin Hao defeated Lin Yun. This shocked everyone because no one expected Li Yuxi would join in. Right then, two more voices resounded. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Young Master Lin, why don’t you fight me first?” The Divine Dao Pavilion’s Zhang Ying coldly sneered.

“Leave a barbarian like him to me. After all, you guys will lower your status to deal with someone like him.” The Myriad Lightning Sect’s Chen Jun said.

With that, all the holy land geniuses were targeting Lin Yun, and everyone quickly realized that they were those who stood against Lin Yun at the banquet last night. What happened now was just a continuation of yesterday's quarrel because the holy land geniuses couldn’t stand Lin Yun's arrogance.

“Don’t worry. It will be your turn soon.” Lin Yun said indifferently, looking at Li Yuxi, Zhang Ying, and Chen Jun.

Everyone around the Nirvana Stage wore grave expressions. They were shocked by Lin Yun’s arrogance and confidence. But when they thought about it, that had always been how Lin Yun had been. Initially, he didn’t place the holy land geniuses in his eyes. He would return humiliation if humiliated and didn’t bother keeping a low profile.

Qin Hao went on the stage with a darkened face and coldly said, “It’s time to resolve the grudge between us. If the rules did not bind us, I would’ve taught you a lesson yesterday!”

“Ha. Then let me see what capability our holy land’s geniuses have!” Lin Yun smiled indifferently.

With a wave of his hand, flames surged behind Qin Hao that manifested into an ancient zither once more. On the other hand, a Thunderstorm zither appeared before Lin Yun. When the Thunderstorm zither appeared, Lin Yun’s restrained his killing intent, and he only had his zither in his eyes.

Qin Hao made a move first, and he unleashed a musical note. His music was like a volcanic eruption, instantly captivating everyone’s gazes. Qin Hao’s movements were gentle, but the musical note he played was shocking. Whenever his fingers danced on the zither, it felt like a volcano had erupted. When countless volcanos erupted, the sky was instantly covered in flames.

Lin Yun’s facial expression was calm. When his ten fingers began to dance on the zither, it sounded like a bolt of rumbling lightning with torrential ferocity and crimson radiance gushing out. He was playing the Prairie Phoenix Fire.

But this time, Lin Yun no longer held back in this song and fully unleashed the ferocity contained within this music with a phoenix manifested from the zither music. Closing his eyes, he vented all his rage through the zither while recalling the Heavenly Path. He recalled how the three realm sons captured Yue Weiwei, and his heart's hatred was utterly vented through the Prairie Phoenix Fire.

The Nirvana Stage was soon enveloped in zither music. When flames from the two sides collided, they instantly filled the entire stage. One side was the crimson flames of a divine phoenix, while the other was an ancient heavenly flame.

When the surroundings heard the zither music, they felt like they were in an ocean of flames. The sky and ground were enveloped in flames with only crimson radiance and ferocious aura remaining.

The Heavenly Flame Sect’s disciple’s pupils were filled with mockery when he saw the scene on the Nirvana Stage—playing fire with Qin Hao? Didn’t Lin Yun know that the Heavenly Flame Sect was an ancestor regarding fire manipulation? So what he did was no different from courting humiliation.

As flames collided, terrifying crimson bolts of lightning flickered around. Right then, a lightning bolt rumbled, and the two flames slammed together. Everyone quickly saw a crimson lightning bolt descend from the sky when the flames clashed.

This made everyone’s hearts tremble, and they didn’t think anyone could withstand such a horrifying phenomenon aside from the holy land geniuses.

But Lin Yun was calm as he executed the Divine Phoenix Touch, and his ten fingers danced even faster on the zither. Lightning also suddenly crackled on the zither, and his hands were too fast. As three afterimages overlapped, the Thunderstorm Zither’s music became sharp, with torrential ferocity converging before forming into a phoenix cry, as if it wanted to break free from all restrictions and burn the world.

The crimson lightning bolt was resolved as crimson light exploded from Lin Yun. This shocked everyone because this was enough to prove Lin Yun’s attainment in music dao wasn’t simple.

But this was just a temporary solution. As long as the flames in the sky did not dissipate, it was just a matter of time before Lin Yun was defeated. Everyone could sense that when Qin Hao fused his martial dao into his music, the flames grew even more terrifying, and it wasn’t purely created by music dao any longer.

But Lin Yun stood fearlessly, and his fingers danced even faster on the zither. His mental energy began to gush with the ten stars within his profound palace shining brightly. The speed of his mental energy poured into the zither, but it still couldn’t keep up with his fingers.

This was shocking, and many people who grasped the music dao were so shocked that their jaws nearly fell off. How terrifying was Lin Yun’s music dao that his mental energy couldn’t keep up with his fingers?

In other words, his current mental cultivation couldn’t keep up with his music dao. If his mental energy could keep up, the power of Lin Yun’s music would become even more terrifying.

Very quickly, a crimson radiance shone from Lin Yun’s zither strings before manifesting into a devastating note. It was like a phoenix that could incinerate everything in the world. This made many people’s hearts tremble. Lin Yun was like an aloof crimson phoenix; they dared not look at him directly.

On the other hand, Qin Hao increased his speed, and his zither music began to fuse into the surrounding flames. Everyone could feel as though they were about to be devoured by the fire, their musical notes combined, and the flames were instantly extinguished.

The musical notes stopped, and the outcome was already determined. Qin Hao was pushed back to the edge of the Nirvana Stage and threw out a mouthful of blood. He fell onto one knee and supported himself with the zither.

Many people’s gazes fell onto Lin Yun, and their pupils shone brightly. An elder of the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion declared, “Lin Xiao wins!”

“Pavilion master, I’m not convinced by the result!” Qin Hao’s pupils radiated with the unwillingness to accept the result. He looked at the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion’s pavilion master and said, “Lin Xiao interfered in my battle with Yue Weiwei earlier, giving me a punch with martial dao. So I’m unconvinced by this outcome unless he can take a punch from me!”
