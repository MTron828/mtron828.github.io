Chapter 1844 - Young Master, Demigod Wine!

Lin Yun passed the jar over to An Liuyan before he continued to retrieve more wine. There were Dragonflame Wine, Burning Heart Wine, Thundercloud Wine, Azure Lotus Wine, Blue Luan Wine, and True Origin Wine. There were a lot of them. The Dragonflame Wine was of fire attribute, and it was useless to Lin Yun. Even so, he could use it to strengthen his vitality and temper his saint physique.

There were some that he drank before, and their effects would decline if he drank them again. But the Blue Luan Wine and Thundercloud Wine were of wind and lightning attributes, and they were perfect for his Azure Dragon Intent.

The Azure Lotus Wine was brewed by legendary Sword Immortals, and the True Origin Wine could strengthen one’s cultivation. They might be wine, but they were comparable to or far surpassing saint pellets. When Gu Jun was done with a song, Lin Yun already collected all the top-tiered wines.

“These wine jars and cups are one with the array. Should we transfer it and place them back?” Lin Yun looked at Gu Jun. His meaning was obvious because if the jars and cups were placed back, the array could continue to brew fine wine.

But Gu Jun held onto the erhu and briefly hesitated before he said, “No one will come here anymore.”

His tone sounded sad, but Lin Yun had no idea how to comfort him. After all, it was inevitable for Gu Jun to feel emotional due to his identity.

“Alright, we already said 70% belongs to me!” Gu Jun furiously glared at Lin Yun.

The corner of Lin Yun’s lips twitched because he was still giving sympathy for this old man earlier. He went straight into the topic, “Demigod Wine.”

“The Demigod Wine is in the tortoiseshell of the Black Tortoise.” Gu Jun weakly said. Playing that song earlier made him increasingly exhausted. His face was ugly, and he awkwardly said, “But I can’t play the Black Thunder Score anymore in my current state.”

“Let me do it. Give me the score.” Lin Yun asked for the score and immediately looked through it. He briefly closed his eyes before he placed the score aside while roughly remembering it.

“Can you do it?” Gu Jun asked suspiciously.

“I’m the Nirvana Banquet’s champion. If I can’t do it, no one else can.” Lin Yun replied.

“Who will go and retrieve the Demigod Wine? “Gu Jun asked.

Lin Yun turned to look at An Liuyan because there wasn’t anyone else. An Liuyan naturally knew what Lin Yun meant, and she nodded her head.

Retrieving the Divine Indigo Bamboo Flute, Lin Yun played the Black Tortoise Score. It didn’t take long for the crystal statue to play together with him.

As dazzling radiance shone from the Black Tortoise’s statue, the runes began to intertwine on the tortoiseshell and emitted a powerful aura.

Seeing this, An Liuyan took a deep breath. But just when she was about to stop, Gu Jun spoke out, “Wait, take this first. It can seal off the wine aroma.”

Gu Jun took out a jade bottle and handed it over to An Liuyan. This made An Liuyan look at the old man with a playful smile because he said nothing when Mei Zihua wanted to give it a try earlier.

“Also, those snakes will launch an attack at you.” Gu Jun warned.

An Liuyan instantly became speechless when she heard that because Gu Jun only talked about that now. If they went according to the initial plan, it wouldn’t be that easy for Lin Yun to obtain the Demigod Wine. But at least he was still reliable and didn’t talk about it after she went over.

Gu Jun looked a little embarrassed, so he awkwardly said, “Boss An, be careful.”

Nodding her head, An Liuyan swallowed a pellet from the jade bottle given to her by Gu Jun before she came to the lake’s heart. The ten-odd snake statues suddenly became alive, launching various attacks at An Liuyan.

An Liuyan furrowed her brows because those serpent statues were harder to deal with than she had imagined. They were shrouded in lightning, and they could even breathe out lightning. She tried several times, but she couldn’t get close to the Black Tortoise Statues, no matter how she tried.

When Lin Yun saw this scene, his heart sank because An Liuyan’s strongest means were in her eyes and illusions were useless against those serpents. Whenever she clashed with those serpents with the Profound Moon Fan, sparks would fly around. 

As a decisive light flashed across An Liuyan’s pupils, she forcibly charged towards the tortoiseshell. The price she paid was being bitten by several serpents with lightning flickering around her body and blood flowing out from her wounds. But An Liuyan managed to land on the tortoiseshell, gritting her teeth before slamming her palm against it, causing it to shatter like a chessboard.

Lin Yun’s face changed, and his heart became chaotic. After all, the serpents in the pool became violent, and even the crystal statue opened her pupils with black energy boiling within her pupils.

When Lin Yun raised his head, he was decisive and placed the Divine Indigo Bamboo Flute on the ground before charging over. It turned out that the cracks on the tortoiseshell were slowly closing up.

“Ah?” An Liuyan was shocked, and the joy on her face disappeared. She clearly saw the Demigod Wine earlier. Just when she was baffled, Lin Yun landed beside her. When a sword ray was unleashed, Lin Yun executed the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent and shattered all the incoming snakes. She realized that Lin Yun decided to give up on the Demigod Wine for her safety. Sheathing his sword, Lin Yun pulled An Liuyan’s hand and left.

“Young Master, the Demigod Wine…” An Liuyan struggled, and she fell into a dilemma while looking at the cracks slowly healing on the tortoiseshell.

“I’m fine. You’re more important than the Demigod Wine.” Lin Yun comforted An Liuyan.

Hearing that, An Liuyan’s eyes became red, and she didn’t know how to respond. Right then, a beautiful melody resounded. It came from Mei Zihua, who had regained consciousness.

There was a zither by his lap, and the score Lin Yun placed to the side hovered before him. He was the descendant of one of the Ten Musical Clans. He was even playing it better than Lin Yun.

The crystal statue reopened its pupils and played the flute by her lips once more. As the tortoiseshell cracked open beneath Lin Yun and An Liuyan’s feet, it revealed a white wine jar. They could even see the wine in the jar. It was the Demigod Wine they dreamt of.

“Young Master, the Demigod Wine!” An Liuyan rejoiced, quickly reaching out for the jar.

Afterwards, Lin Yun swiftly returned with An Liuyan in his embrace. When he landed on the ground, he staggered and felt dizzy. He immediately sat on the ground to adjust his breathing. He was lucky that he didn’t go in there for long or who knew what the consequences would be if he fell into the pool.

“Boss An, are you alright?” Gu Jun quickly came over, blaming himself for what happened to An Liuyan. But in reality, he couldn’t be blamed for this matter. He might be a little stingy, but he had no intentions of harming anyone.

An Liuyan’s face was pale, but her face was covered with a smile. She replied, “I’m fine, and it no longer hurts. Elder Gu doesn’t have to be so nervous.”

When Lin Yun reopened his eyes, An Liuyan quickly handed the Demigod Wind over, “Young Master, the Demigod Wine!”

Reaching out to take it, Lin Yun and An Liuyan looked at each other with the latter looking a little bashful.

This naturally made Gu Jun a little sour in his heart. But he had to be honest that he might not be able to give up on the Demigod Wine as decisively as Lin Yun. It was no wonder that An Liuyan was so devoted to him, but Gu Jun still couldn’t help cursing Lin Yun in his heart.Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Haha. It’s still on me at the crucial moment.” Mei Zihua smiled. “Brother Lin, do you remember what I said? You won’t die with me around.”

“Hehe, of course. Young Master Mei is the best!” An Liuyan chuckled.

“Haha, not bad.” Mei Zihua replied modestly.

“Everyone has contributed to the Demigod Wine, so let us share a cup first.” Lin Yun sat down and placed the Demigod Wine before everyone.

“Uh, I don’t want it anymore.” Gu Jun was still blaming himself for what happened to An Liuyan earlier.

This made Lin Yun feel that Gu Jun was a responsible person. But he knew Gu Jun had nothing to do with what happened to An Liuyan.

An Liuyan naturally knew what Lin Yun was thinking, so she dragged Gu Jun over. She smiled, “Elder Gu, come on. Young Master is treating you to some wine, so give him some face.”

Her gentle voice sounded as though it could melt the hearts of anyone, and this made Gu Jun sigh because she was on Lin Yun’s side. Since they had already invited him, this Demigod Wine would belong to him as long as he agreed to it.

Gu Jun merely hesitated for a moment before he finally agreed to it and sat back down.

Seeing this, An Liuyan smiled as she sat beside Lin Yun and called Mei Zihua over. With that, the four of them surrounded the Demigod Wine.
