Chapter 2073 - I'm Also Here!

The next day, when sunlight dissipated, streaks of light soared across the sky, heading towards the Hidden Sword Manor when they opened the spiritual array sealing the entire manor. Countless people were heading towards the Hidden Sword Lake like a flock of locusts, and the sky had turned dark from their figures.

The scenery today was more lively than the Sword Assembly three days ago. After three days of fermentation, the news of the battle between Ye Qingtian and Feng Shaoyu had long spread throughout Southern Border. Many monstrous Quasi-Saints of the eighteen holy lands had rushed over.

When everyone looked at the center of the lake, there was a giant sword hovering in the air with eight statues in the surroundings, and a person was standing on the Kunpeng statue. The statue’s wings were spread far apart as he sat on the statue’s back, looking as though he would soar to the sky at any time.

“Feng Shaoyu…” A commotion came from the surroundings because this wasn’t the Sword Alliance’s geniuses seeing Feng Shaoyu. But for some reason, they felt that the Feng Shaoyu they saw today was different from usual, but they couldn’t describe how he was different.

“Feng Shaoyu is polite with those from the Sword Alliance, and people rarely see him fight. But those who see him make a move know that his title as the Young Manor Master isn’t in vain.”

“Ye Qingtian is too cocky to challenge a Quasi-Saint at the pinnacle Azure Origin Phase with his cultivation at the seventh transformation of the Nirvana Stage.”

“I bet today's battle won’t be as exciting as three days ago. After all, there’s a huge difference in their strengths.”

“It’s hard to say. Ye Qingtian isn’t a fool. Do you think he’d dare to challenge Feng Shaoyu if he didn’t have any confidence?”

“Ye Qingtian is here!” Two streaks of light flew over and appeared on the plaza. They were the Indigothunder Peak Master and Ye Qingtian.

When Lin Yun landed on the ground, he raised his head to look at Feng Shaoyu and was surprised by Feng Shaoyu’s early arrival. Sensing his gaze, Feng Shaoyu opened his eyes with the spiritual energy sweeping out.

A smile rose on Feng Shaoyu’s lips as a hint of ferocity flashed within Feng Shaoyu’s eyes, looking like a drawn sword.

“Ye Qingtian, I’ve been waiting for you for a long time!” Feng Shaoyu glared at Lin Yun from a distance away.

When Lin Yun’s gaze fell onto Feng Shaoyu, he could sense the majestic saint aura within Feng Shaoyu’s body that felt like a boiling sun.

This saint aura is really terrifying… Lin Yun inwardly sighed. After all, he had already experienced how powerful saint aura was, and he was in a disadvantageous position as long as he was at the Nirvana Stage, so he would have to be on his guard.

On the other hand, his opponent didn’t have such concerns. As long as Feng Shaoyu could land a strike on Lin Yun, there was a high chance that the battle's outcome would be determined. But Lin Yun had no choice but to fight for the Cauldron Sword.

The Flower Burial Sword began to vibrate within Lin Yun’s hand, as though it had sensed Lin Yun’s strong desire to win and the pressure from facing such a formidable opponent. The Flower Burial Sword couldn’t speak, but it could sense Lin Yun’s intentions as though it was saying that it was together with Lin Yun.

“I’m also here,” Lin Yun smiled. The Flower Burial Sword vibrated even more violently, with powerful fighting spirits accumulating.

“Be careful, and don’t forget what I told you,” the Indigothunder Peak Master reminded.

“Don’t worry about it. I’ll go up first,” Lin Yun smiled.

Lin Yun spread his arms apart and nimbly flew out, before firmly landing on the lake.

“This fellow really dares come to die,” Feng Shengling slammed on the railing with a displeased expression. Ye Qingtian was too tough to deal with, forcing the Hidden Sword Manor into an unfavorable position. If Feng Shaoyu loses today’s battle, Feng Shengling couldn’t imagine the consequences.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Don’t worry. He won’t have that chance. No matter Ye Qingtian's trump cards, he’ll be defeated today. At that time, he might not even have the opportunity to regret it,” Zhao Wuji said.

The elders of the Feng Clan all came here, including the Manor Master, Feng Wuji. But his expression was cold, as though he wasn’t interested in the outcome of this battle.

Feng Shaoyu, who was sitting on the kunpeng statue, jumped down from the statue and landed a hundred meters in front of Lin Yun with his majestic saint aura exploding forth, placing everyone under tremendous pressure.

Lin Yun took a deep breath, and his gaze became sharp.

“Ye Qingtian, you still have the chance to give up now. Otherwise, I might be unable to hold back from taking your life in a life-and-death battle,” Feng Shaoyu said coldly. The moment he spoke, the atmosphere was tense, instantly making everyone nervous.

“Let’s cut the nonsense. No matter what, I will win this battle, so you don’t have to worry about it. To take the Cauldron Sword, I’ll do my best to spare your life, no matter what,” Lin Yun said.

When Lin Yun said those words, a commotion came from the surroundings.

“Hahaha, as expected of you! You’re truly cocky and even more cocky than three days ago!” Feng Shaoyu laughed. He grabbed his left wrist with his right hand then his fingers pierced into his flesh before pulling out a long spine from his arm.

The spine was white, like a beautiful jade emitting a saint radiance. There were a total of eighteen sections with a length of six feet. This was a bone sword.

The sword emitted a powerful saint radiance and dragon aura. Looking from afar, a blood line on the bone emitted a terrifying chill.

Before the sword was activated, snowflakes began falling from the sky. But if one looked at it closely, the snowflakes were cold flames.

Feng Shaoyu caressed the sword and said, “The name of this sword is Thunderflame, forged with the spine of a Saint Realm demonic beast. That demonic beast possessed a divine dragon’s bloodline. After being tempered with earth flame and heavenly flame, the dragon's soul was preserved. This is a genuine saint sword!”

That was a long introduction. Simply put, this was a Twospirit Glory Saint Artifact, possessing both fire and ice attributes. Furthermore, the sword even contained a dragon aura and saint radiance. This could be considered an excellent sword amongst Twospirit Glory Saint Artifacts. It was powerful, and it could be called invincible.

Feng Shaoyu said, “I’ve used this sword to slay thirteen Quasi-Saints. You might have been able to confront me if you didn’t snap the Heavenly Dipper Sword three days ago, but it’s too late for you to regret it now.”

“I’m enough with his sword,” Lin Yun said.

“A nameless sword,” Feng Shaoyu sneered in disdain. The Dragon Bone Sword emitted a terrifying chill, as though Lin Yun’s sword provoked it.

“So what?” Lin Yun said. When he said that, the Flower Burial Sword began to tremble violently and released a dazzling cold radiance. The Flower Burial Sword seemed to declare that it wasn’t a nameless sword. It was sharp and also had its pride.

“Blood Purgatory Radiance!” Feng Shaoyu swung his sword fiercely. In the next second, a terrifying cold sword aura soared to the sky as the blood line on the sword was activated, manifesting into a crimson sword aura.

A crimson cloud enveloped ten-odd miles in radius with sword aura forming into a crimson purgatory. There seemed to be a ghost king hidden within purgatory, releasing a ferocious roar and pouncing at Lin Yun. This was the inheritance martial technique of the Hidden Sword Manor, the Blood Purgatory Sword Art.

This was a ghost spirit martial technique but several times stronger than an ordinary ghost spirit martial technique. If it was executed in conjunction with the cultivation technique that came with it, the power this sword technique could unleash would even surpass the levels of a ghost spirit martial technique.

Judging from the aura that came from Feng Shaoyu, the faces of everyone from the observation stand changed.

“It’s no wonder why Feng Shaoyu is so confident. With the Thunderflame Sword paired with the Blood Purgatory Sword Art and his saint aura, no one beneath the Quasi-Saint Realm can take an attack from him.”

“The young manor master’s strength is really shocking. If I don’t reach the Quasi-Saint Realm, I’m afraid that even I can’t block a single sword from him,” Gu Zijing said.

“I wonder how many swords Ye Qingtian can block,” Feng Shengling said.

“Haha. It’s enough for his name to spread throughout the Kunlun Realm if he can block three swords,” Zhao Wuji sneered.

Everyone within the palace could sense how terrifying Feng Shaoyu’s attack was. All the geniuses on the observation stand could sense the shocking pressure, instantly making everyone nervous.

Lin Yun circulated the Azure Dragon Sword Heart as a silver radiance shone from him, and his gaze fell onto the Flower Burial Sword hovering before him.

“Fight!” Lin Yun flicked his finger and the azure dragon fused with the Flower Burial Sword before turning into a light beam, stabbing towards the ghost king.

The power of this Blood Purgatory Sword Art was very powerful. But even if it was powerful, Lin Yun could detect the flaws of this sword technique with his Azure Dragon Sword Heart.

When the Flower Burial Sword pierced into the ghost king’s heart, the flaw of this sword technique was exposed and cracks began to appear on the ghost king.

The Flower Burial Sword easily shattered the ghost king and dissipated into snowflakes.

After Lin Yun broke through Feng Shaoyu’s attack, he formed a saint seal and controlled the Flower Burial Sword to attack Feng Shaoyu. When the Flower Burial Sword streaked across the sky, it was like an azure dragon with a dragon aura sweeping out, and the dragon aura it gave off even suppressed the Thunderflame Sword.

“Holy shit, that’s the sword heart reaching the spiritual stage?”

“Ye Qingtian is really a genius. Many swordsmen at the Saint Realm haven’t even grasped the sword heart. But not only did Ye Qingtian grasp the sword heart, he even reached the spiritual stage with it. I’m afraid even geniuses from ancient times weren’t at his level.”

“It’s no wonder why Ye Qingtian is confident about this battle. He probably didn’t even use half of the power of his Azure Dragon Sword Heart three days ago.”

Reaching the spiritual stage in the sword heart was something that every swordsman dreamt of reaching. Many older generation swordsmen hadn’t even grasped the sword heart or reached the spiritual stage with it.

“Slaughtering Ghost King!” Feng Shaoyu circulated the saint aura within his body with the Dragon Bone Sword in his hand and knocked the Flower Burial Sword away.

When the Flower Burial Sword was knocked away, Feng Shaoyu stepped forward and came above Lin Yun.

“This sword is enough to kill you! Blood Purgatory Prison!” Feng Shaoyu didn’t want to waste time with Ye Qingtian and knocked his sword away so that Ye Qingtian couldn’t summon it back anytime soon.

Feng Shaoyu didn’t believe that Ye Qingtian could block this sword from him without a sword. Everything happened too quickly, and everyone’s faces turned pale. They knew the battle had ended because Ye Qingtian was still too tender to face a Quasi-Saint.

Right then, an unbelievably powerful sword intent exploded from Ye Qingtian. A sword star also appeared behind him with a terrifying sword intent sweeping out.

All the swordsmen with a sword within a hundred miles in radius suddenly lost control of their swords, and their swords flew in Ye Qingtian’s direction.

“What’s going on?!”

“My sword!”

As multiple saint swords flew over, they looked as though they were paying respect to their king, and this scene left everyone dumbfounded. When they looked at Ye Qingtian, they were shocked to discover that there was a blazing star above Ye Qingtian’s head: the Great Sun Sword Star.

Seeing this, everyone was dumbfounded because an uncontrollable thought popped up. They instantly recognized that it was the Astral Sword Intent at greater mastery.
