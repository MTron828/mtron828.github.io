Chapter 1418 - 'Joining Hands'

The Indigo Dragon Serpent gave everyone immense pressure. This was a monarch demonic beast at the Heavenly Elysium Core Realm, and no one here dared to face it. More accurately speaking, no one was willing to fight it alone.

Firstly, it wasn’t easy to defeat an Indigo Dragon Serpent. Secondly, there were so many people here. So even if they managed to kill the Indigo Dragon Serpent, it would only benefit others.

When Lin Yun swept his gaze over, his expression became grave. The Indigo Dragon Serpent had taken a humanoid form. It was ten meters in size and wielded rusted chains in both hands. The purple scales on its body were like armor, covering it.

But its pupils were the most terrifying part about it. They contained powerful sword intent that was comparable to firmament sword intent. It was born from the Spiritual Sword Bead within its body. But since it didn’t comprehend any dao, it couldn’t grasp the genuine firmament sword intent. So its sword intent was rather crude, but it seemed to grasp another method of cultivating by imprinting its sword intent on its body.

“Hmph. You guys are courting death!” The Indigo Dragon Serpent looked at everyone while everyone looked at it. When an eerie aura swept out from it, the Indigo Dragon Serpent swung the chains in its hands. “No one is allowed to move before I devour all of the ninth-grade Spiritual Sword Beads. Anyone who dares to move will die. As for the other Spiritual Sword Beads, this dragon is not interested in them, so I can consider rewarding them if you guys are well-behaved…”

Simultaneously, a powerful sword intent spread out, making everyone’s faces ugly. Even top-tiered Heavenly Elysium Core Realm geniuses would have a hard time fighting it, not to mention Greater Elysium Core Realm geniuses. After all, the Indigo Dragon Serpent was at the Heavenly Elysium Core Realm.

“Haha. A mere snake like you dares to call yourself a dragon? You must be asking for a beating!” Xiahou Yan laughed with a cold light flashing through his pupils. “I bet everyone here can tell that the tenth-grade Spiritual Sword Bead is inside the Indigo Dragon Serpent, and no one can obtain it or the ninth-grade Spiritual Sword Beads if we don’t kill it. So I suggest we all work together to kill this snake first. What do you guys think?”

Xiahou Yan smiled as he swept his gaze over the other geniuses. He and Huang Yancheng knew that the Indigo Dragon Serpent was strong, and they weren’t confident about taking it down, even if they teamed up. But it was different if everyone here teamed up. They might be able to retrieve the tenth-grade Spiritual Sword Bead from the Indigo Dragon Serpent.

“I have no opinion about that. This is just a small snake, and it has no position here.” Jiang Cheng said.

“I concur.” Chen Bing smiled.

“What about Lady Ye?” Xiahou Yan looked in Ye Ziyun’s direction with a playful smile.

“I’m with Young Master Lin,” Ye Ziyun replied.

Lin Yun was surprised to hear that and was also impressed by Ye Ziyun’s thick face. She had quickly treated what happened two days ago as something that had never happened. Her words also tied her to him, and Lin Yun wasn’t in a position to explain, either.

“Young Master Lin, what do you think? It’s fine if you’re not joining us, but you can’t join the fight for the tenth-grade Spiritual Sword Bead.” Xiahou Yan awkwardly smiled after his face briefly stiffened upon hearing what Ye Ziyun said.

“Who gets the tenth-grade Spiritual Sword Bead after we kill the Indigo Dragon Serpent?” Lin Yun asked.

“It goes to whoever is capable of obtaining it,” Xiahou Yan smiled.

“I have no opinion about that.” Lin Yun replied. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“You people really talk a lot…” While everyone was discussing amongst themselves, Jiang Cheng already charged forth and launched his attack on the Indigo Dragon Serpent. A black sword appeared in his hand and Jiang Cheng swung it down at the Indigo Dragon Serpent, activating the hundred saint runes simultaneously and unleashing a terrifying sword aura.

As sparks flew, the Indigo Dragon Serpent released a roar and swung its chains. Simultaneously, it spat a crimson demonic light from its mouth that contained a vile venom, enveloping the region Jiang Cheng was in.

As piercing sounds echoed, something bizarre occurred. Jiang Cheng’s sword aura was being corroding under the demonic light. Jiang Cheng’s sword aura could also be seen swiftly shrinking away. Soon, it would be devoured by the demonic light.

Right then, Jiang Cheng unleashed his two-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm aura, causing a massive explosion and the pressure from the venom was completely erased.

“Go!” Everyone soared to the sky and charged at the Indigo Dragon Serpent, summoning their constellations at the same time.

“You guys can just focus on collecting the ordinary Spiritual Sword Beads. I’ll figure something out about the ninth-grade Spiritual Sword Beads.” Lin Yun said. The value of the ninth-grade Spiritual Sword Beads wasn’t any less than the tenth-grade Spiritual Sword Bead. So he knew that those Ancient Saint Clans wouldn’t relinquish them so easily. If possible, who wouldn’t want all six ninth-grade Spiritual Sword Beads?

Ye Ziyun and Zhao Yan nodded their heads. They had no objection to that. They mainly wanted to obtain the qualification to become a disciple of a saint at this stage.

Meanwhile, Lin Yun didn’t hesitate to charge at the Indigo Dragon Serpent. Everyone else was fighting, so he wasn’t in a position to just stand and watch, or he would cause public outrage. Most importantly, the Indigo Dragon Serpent was a formidable opponent, and it would be huge trouble if Lin Yun faced it himself.

“Lin Yun is here.” Ye Qing whispered to Ye Ziyun.

When Ye Ziyun turned to look at Lin Yun, her eyes shone as she watched him be enveloped in boundless astral energy. The astral energy within Lin Yun’s body was so great that it started leaking out. This shocked Ye Ziyun because this was a sign that Lin Yun was about to make a breakthrough to the Greater Elysium Core Realm, not to mention that it had only been three days since they had last met.

Lin Yun quickly dashed forth and threw his punch at the Indigo Dragon Serpent. Lin Yun could sense a powerful rebound force when his fist collided with the Indigo Dragon Serpent. The Indigo Dragon Serpent’s scales were even more terrifying than saint artifacts, and the Indigo Dragon Serpent didn’t suffer even a light injury from his attack.

“Aren’t the scales a little too hard?” Lin Yun locked his brows. The Indigo Dragon Serpent’s physique was stronger than his and Qin Cang’s physique. Then again, only Lin Yun would think about that. A demonic beast’s most significant advantages were their physiques and bloodlines, so no one would be foolish enough to clash with a demonic beast head-on.

On the contrary, the advantage of human cultivators was their comprehension and inheritance. For example, the Indigo Dragon Serpent had a powerful sword intent, but it didn’t know how to use it and could only crudely use it. Not to mention that the Indigo Dragon Serpent’s sword intent wasn’t refined, either.

With Lin Yun joining the fight, the sword mound became even more chaotic, while others gathered the scattered Spiritual Sword Beads. The surrounding swordsmen at the outer circle were fighting amongst themselves for Spiritual Sword Beads, while those in the inner circle joined hands to fight demonic beasts. So the outer and inner circles had a drastic difference.

After several attacks, Lin Yun took a deep breath and retreated while falling into deep thoughts. The Indigo Dragon Serpent was still vigorous, even after being besieged by ten-odd people, and no one managed to injure the Indigo Dragon Serpent. Until now, they didn’t even manage to remove a scale from the Indigo Dragon Serpent, not to mention hurting it.

“Brother Xiahou, this snake seems to possess some bloodline of the dragon clan. At the very least, its scales are comparable to dragon scales.” Chen Bing sighed, looking at Xiahou Yan.

“Its scales have undergone hundreds or thousands of years of refinement with sword intent. Unless we can break its scales, it’ll be hard for us to deal any injuries to it…” Xiahou Yan replied.

“It’s not that extraordinary. It hasn’t fully refined its scales yet, so it’s not invincible. If Brother Xiahou is willing, I believe you can easily break through its scales…” Chen Bing smiled.

Xiahou Yan merely glanced at Chen Bing before he fell into silence. Chen Bing was secretly signaling that he could use his firmament sword intent, but everyone here was a cunning fox. Anyone here could break the Indigo Dragon Serpent’s scales if they wanted, but the Indigo Dragon Serpent was an intelligent demonic beast. At that time, it would definitely target anyone who injured it or even drag that person down before it died. Xiahou Yan wasn’t stupid, so he wouldn’t fall for it.

“I do have a way…” Huang Yancheng smiled and transmitted his voice to Xiahou Yan and Chen Bing. His words changed Xiahou Yan and Chen Bing’s faces, and they knew why Huang Yancheng was so infamous. But considering it again, they could see the possibility in Huang Yancheng’s method.

Lin Yun casually glanced in Xiahou Yan and Chen Bing’s direction; he could feel that an undercurrent was flowing. Although he pretended to see nothing, he secretly took note of them. He knew they couldn’t be serious about killing the Indigo Dragon Serpent and were planning something. Since that was the case, everyone might as well give up on the Indigo Dragon Serpent.

Without hesitation, Lin Yun gave up on defeating the Indigo Dragon Serpent and headed straight for the six ninth-grade Spiritual Sword Beads. No one dared to make a move before the Indigo Dragon Serpent was killed. If anyone moved, then the feeble alliance between them would instantly collapse.

After all, the ninth-grade Spiritual Sword Beads might be comparable to a tenth-grade Spiritual Sword Bead if they managed to collect a few of them.

“Let’s go. You want to mess with me? I’ll show you the consequences of messing with me, then!” Xiahou Yan’s eyes flashed coldly.
