Chapter 917 - Disregarding Life and Death With One Sword

Countless sword rays enveloped the entire chamber as tens of thousands of vipers hissed at Lin Yun. Chen An’s dao artifact was truly powerful.

A crimson light exploded as Chen An’s whip wriggled and turned into a genuine viper. When the head of the viper glared at Lin Yun, he could sense an immense pressure crashing down on his heart. It felt like the viper would swallow him whole at any moment.

“Lin Yun, what do you think of my Blood Viper Whip?” laughed Chen An as he soared into the sky. The Blood Viper Whip cut through the air and tried to bite Lin Yun’s heart. The power of the strike could easily crush a first soul Heavenly Soul Realm genius from Glorysun Land.

“Not bad, I guess.” Although it was Lin Yun’s first time facing a dao artifact, he didn’t panic and summoned his sword. As he did this, the viper suddenly shot at his wrist.

“What speed!” Lin Yun was surprised. He knew that if he continued to summon his sword, the viper would bite him. With that, Lin Yun gave up summoning his sword and circulated his sword sutras.

An Azure Firmament Tree appeared behind him with an immortal azure dragon image coiled around it. The power of a dao artifact was truly impressive, but Lin Yun ultimately managed to take the attack head-on.

“Spiritual sword intent!” Chen An’s face changed. He was surprised because there was something weird about Lin Yun’s spiritual sword intent. The moment his whip came in contact with Lin Yun’s punch, the power of the dao artifact had directly shattered Lin Yun’s sword intent. However, Lin Yun’s sword aura felt immortal as if it wouldn’t die.

Whenever Lin Yun’s sword intent was extinguished, it would regenerate in the blink of an eye. Chen An could confront Lin Yun’s sword intent by relying on his cultivation and dao artifact, but it was impossible for him to crush Lin Yun.

“It’s rude if I don’t give you a gift either. Take this!” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly as a domineering azure dragon flew out with his sword intent and immortal azure dragon sword aura.

Facing Lin Yun’s attack, Chen An frowned before he took several steps back and used his whip to annihilate the attack.

“Overlord Sword—Thunderbolt Slash!” Before Chen An could react, Lin Yun flicked his wrist and poured nearly a hundred azure-purple sword rays into his attack.

“Pitiful tricks.” Chen An pulled his whip back and crushed the incoming sword ray. With a dao artifact in his hand, Chen An felt no pressure facing this sort of attack.

But before he could take the opportunity to counterattack, Lin Yun started unleashing a series of attacks, “Solar Slash! Big Bang! Breaking Dawn! Tai’a Slash! Blood Suppression!”

The Overlord Sword’s grade might be lacking, but it was easy for Lin Yun to control it. He was able to unleash six forms in a single breath and pushed them to the limit. With that, Lin Yun’s figure began to flash around the chamber with all sorts of phenomenons flying out.

“This fellow…” Chen An cursed because Lin Yun’s attainment in the sword was too terrifying. Chen An quickly threw away the idea of counterattacking and poured his origin energy into his whip. In the next second, the crimson viper started to grow into a huge dragon.

“Dragon Surge!” Chen An’s whip glowed brightly as the crimson viper transformed into a dragon. With the sudden boost in power, Chen An easily destroyed all of Lin Yun’s phenomena. Then, he charged towards Lin Yun.

“What great timing!” Lin Yun bravely faced the dragon as his hair fluttered in the wind.

“Supreme Dominance!” Lin Yun roared as the previous phenomena attacked Chen An once again.

With a huge collision, the crimson dragon suddenly started to crack. Lin Yun’s sword ray successfully stopped the dragon in its tracks. In the blink of an eye, the dragon crumbled and returned to the size of a viper. As it shrunk, it shot towards Lin Yun’s wrist.

Chen An knew where his advantage lay in the battle. He would rely on his dao artifact to prevent Lin Yun from drawing his sword. With the dao artifact, he could take full advantage of his cultivation. After all, the scene of Feng Wuji’s death was still vivid in his mind.

“This fellow is too troublesome. He fights like someone who has gone through their tribulation. I need to be patient and wear him down slowly…” Chen An was shocked that Lin Yun could still unleash such a powerful move.

Facing Chen An’s attack, Lin Yun retreated with the Cloud Soaring Art. The power of a dao artifact was too terrifying, and he wasn’t confident he could take it head-on with his current cultivation. Without his sword, his disadvantage in cultivation would be amplified.

Chen An refused to let Lin Yun go as his whip crackled through the air.

Lin Yun avoided the attacks from Chen An and his eyes flashed with thought. The power of a dao artifact was truly terrifying, especially in the hands of a genius from a higher realm. If he only relied on his spiritual sword intent, he would lose. Fortunately, his spiritual sword intent wasn’t all he relied on.

Lin Yun’s eyes suddenly flashed with explosive power coursing through his body. The thunderstorm energy started circulating with an azure dragon’s roar. Then, the azure dragon mark on his chest shined brightly with crimson radiance.

Immense pressure spread out as the dragon runes on Lin Yun’s body started to squirm. He had brought out another one of his trump cards, the Azure Dragon Enneaform—Decaform.

With a roar, Lin Yun soared into the sky and threw a punch enveloped in lightning.

Taking this attack head-on, Chen An threw up a mouthful of blood. He was shocked to discover that with the high-frequency vibration in the air, his whip couldn't move. He never thought that Lin Yun had another method to deal with his dao artifact.

If they were somewhere else with more space, it would be impossible for Lin Yun to restrict Chen An. Fortunately for Lin Yun, they were in a small chamber.

Lin Yun charged like an azure dragon, which caught Chen An by surprise. His origin energy shattered as he was hit by Lin Yun’s fist.

Chen An didn’t hesitate to run. He knew that without his dao artifact, Lin Yun would definitely draw his sword. Even in perfect condition, Chen An wasn’t confident that he could take Lin Yun’s sword head-on. Since he was already injured, his chances were slim.

With the remainder of his strength, Chen An threw a punch at the door and left. However, he didn’t feel relieved even though he exited the chamber.

It wasn’t until he felt the rejection force of the barrier that he felt relieved. He would be fine if he managed to leave. As for his fight with Lin Yun, he could get revenge with Shi Feng later.𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Just as the gate was about to open, Lin Yun drew his sword. Instantly, he unleashed Azure Lotus.

After he sheathed his sword, he turned to look at the jade slip. He knew that he should take it as soon as possible before anything unexpected happened again.
