Chapter 1443 - Cloud Soaring Peak

Mu Xuankong nodded with a gentle smile when he looked at Lin Yun. “Alright. You can go first to refine the astral saint dust. I’ll officially confer you as a heaven direct disciple in a few days. Someone will inform you when the time comes.”

Lin Yun nodded and was looking forward to becoming a heaven direct disciple. When he saw the envious gazes in the surroundings, he could easily judge that the status as a heaven direct disciple wasn’t simple.

“Alright. You can all disperse now.” Mu Xuankong said as he looked around.

Everyone quickly bade their farewell and left the Divine Firmament Peak. But when they looked at Lin Yun, many were unhappy and were discussing amongst themselves while they left.

“This is really unprecedented, to give an Elysium Core Realm disciple the status of a heaven direct disciple. The sect master seems to like Lin Yun a lot.”

“If I remember correctly, even his two biological daughters didn’t receive such treatment, right?”

“No matter what, Lin Yun is only at the one-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm. Let’s not mention the top ten on the Earth Ranking; those in the top fifty would also be unhappy about this. This is too cruel.”

“The sect master said Lin Yun suffered grievances on the Heavenly Path. As the strongest genius in the history of the Heavenly Paths, what grievances can he possibly suffer?”

Today was destined to be chaotic, whether it was Lin Yun breaking the record for the Saint Pool or becoming a heaven direct disciple. Without two to three months, it would be difficult for this commotion to subside. After all, it was unprecedented in the history of the Sword Sect.

“Feng Luan, bring that brat to a new residence. Since he’s a heaven direct disciple, his treatment naturally follows the specification of a heaven direct disciple. So he won’t stay in his previous residence anymore.” Mu Chuan said with a delighted smile.

“Junior Brother, come with me.” Feng Luan smiled as he stepped forth.

“Sorry about the trouble, Senior Brother Feng.” Lin Yun smiled.

After the two left, Mu Xuankong turned to look at Mu Chuan. “Come with me. We have to find a solution since he scraped off nine layers of the Saint Pool. After all, we can’t possibly seal off the Saint Pool for a hundred years.”

His words made Mu Chuan’s face stiff as his smile swiftly disappeared.

“Sect master, how will we explain Lin Yun becoming a heaven direct disciple to the other Earth Ranking geniuses? I’m afraid that they will become impulsive…” The other peak masters looked at Mu Xuankong, not letting him leave.

But Mu Xuankong was calm. He knew the peak masters were trying to get something out of him. So he wore a casual smile and replied, “There’s no need to explain anything to them. Everything is as per usual. If they’re unhappy, let them enter the Saint Pool and stay there for thirty days. If they can accomplish that, they’ll be given the status as a heaven direct disciple like Lin Yun. If they can’t, then you guys can deal with them yourselves. Mu Chuan, come with me!”

The surrounding peak masters’ lips twitched when they heard that. They could predict that the geniuses on the Earth Ranking would be furious if they heard that.

“Looks like our sect master really likes Lin Yun.” The Golden Firmament Peak’s peak master smiled and sighed simultaneously. Regardless of Lin Yun being able to enter the Saint Pool when he had just joined the Sword Sect or becoming a heaven direct disciple, they were unprecedented in the history of the Sword Sect.

“Perhaps the sect master thinks Lin Yun will become the next Jian Jingtian.”

“It’s still too early to talk about that. Jian Jingtian shone brightly back then, unrivaled in the Ancient Barren Domain and shook the entire Eastern Desolation. But Lin Yun isn’t even in the Dragon Pulse Realm.”

“Let’s go. We’ll leave this matter to the younger generation to feel a headache about. The Five Peaks Competition will start soon, and I bet it’ll be exciting.” The remaining peak masters briefly chatted before they left.

Even the peak masters were shocked that Lin Yun became a heaven direct disciple, so one could only imagine how shocked the disciples would feel.

“Big Sister, let’s catch up! I’m friends with Lin Yun!” Mu Qingqing excitedly said, looking at Lin Yun and Feng Luan’s silhouettes. She was curious about how Lin Yun managed to stay in the Saint Pool for thirty days.

But Mu Xueqin glared and warned her, “You’re really stupid. I won’t go, and you’re not allowed to go, either.”

“Why?” Mu Qingqign said unhappily.

“Figure it out yourself.” Mu Xueqin quickly ignored Mu Qingqing. Mu Qingqing was usually smart and had a great relationship with everyone. But her brain would shut down at times. Lin Yun was now a target of everyone. If they visited him, it was the same as pouring oil onto the fire.

Although she wouldn’t mind what others think of her, it was unavoidable for others to mind. Not to mention that they both had beauty and strength, or they wouldn’t be considered goddesses in the hearts of many disciples. So it would only cause greater chaos if they visited Lin Yun.

Lin Yun followed Feng Luan to the main hall of the Divine Firmament Peak to obtain a jade token before they left the Divine Firmament Peak. There were hundreds of floating islands around the Divine Firmament Peak, and it was a majestic scene. They looked like leveled mountains while hovering in the air.

After they traveled through the clouds, it didn’t take long for them to arrive at a small-scaled floating island. This might be a small-scaled floating island, but it wasn’t small at all. In the mortal world, it was comparable to a small-scaled city with a radius of a few thousand miles.

“This is the Dragon Soaring Peak, and it’ll be your residence in the future. The name is domineering. Let's hope you’ll become a dragon soaring into the clouds in the future!” Feng Luan smiled.

Lin Yun was surprised by the treatment that he was being given. To think that he was given an entire floating mountain. The entire floating mountain was shrouded in mist and protected by a triple-layered array.

“Dragon Soaring Peak… let’s call it the Cloud Soaring Peak, instead,” Lin Yun said.

When Feng Luan heard what Lin Yun said, his eyes lit up, and he clapped his hands together, “Marvelous! This is a good name with the ambition of fleeting clouds and soaring to the sky. It also fits your name well! Quick, try the jade token that you obtained.”

Lin Yun smiled because Feng Luan really knew how to speak. He then took out the jade token and injected his astral energy into it. In the next second, the clouds separated like a screen, revealing a massive palace on the flat ground, enveloped in spiritual energy.

There were hills, rivers, and even a decent-sized spiritual lake on the Cloud Soaring Peak. The lake's surface was as clear as a mirror with fishes swimming in it and the reflection of birds on it. Aside from that, there was also a training ground and elixir refining chamber; all sorts of cultivating facilities could be found there.

“In the future, when you reach the Samsara Edict Realm, you can recruit your own servants or spiritualists to refine elixirs. There are a lot of benefits as a heaven direct disciple…” Feng Luan chuckled as he looked at Lin Yun.

“Senior Brother, how many heaven direct disciples are there in our Divine Firmament Peak?” Lin Yun asked.

“It’s shameful to talk about it. We only have two other heaven direct disciples in the Divine Firmament Peak. Including you, we have three heaven direct disciples.” Feng Luan sighed.

Lin Yun was shocked when he heard that. The entire Divine Firmament Peak only had three heaven direct disciples? This was a little too unbelievable.

“It’s more or less the same for the other peaks. Aside from the ten on the Heaven Ranking, it’s too hard to become a heaven direct disciple…” Feng Luan then explained how tough it was to become a heaven direct disciple, leaving Lin Yun speechless when he heard that.

“I’ll bid my farewell, first. You don’t have to rush to visit the Martial Arts Hall. After your token as a heaven direct disciple is done, you’ll have more choices to pick from.” Feng Luan said before cupping his hands together.

“Senior Brother, wait a minute. Why didn’t I see my senior sister and the others?” Lin Yun asked. He stayed at the bottom of the Saint Pool for a month, shaking the entire Sword Sect. So it made no sense that Ye Ziling and Zhao Yan didn’t come. But when Lin Yun swept his gaze around earlier, he couldn’t find them.

“They’re saint disciples, so they’ll naturally cultivate beside the saints. So they should be on Saint Mountain for about six months or so. I’m afraid they’ll undergo a huge transformation when they come out.” Feng Luan’s eyes flashed with envy when he talked about that.

After all, it was an opportunity to cultivate with a saint in a treasured place like Saint Mountain, and even he couldn’t help feeling envious of this opportunity. Typically speaking, it should be the same for Lin Yun, as well.

When Lin Yun saw the doubt in Feng Luan’s eyes, he merely smiled without explaining. The Radiant Sword Saint was in seclusion to make a breakthrough, and it was already difficult for the Radiant Sword Saint to spare some time for him once every six months.

Lin Yun didn’t want to disrupt his master and didn’t dare to accept six months of guidance from the Radiant Sword Saint. But he couldn’t tell Feng Luan about that. If news got out that his master only had five years of his lifespan left, it would spread unease in the Sword Sect.

Then again, no secrets could be kept hidden forever, and Lin Yun wasn’t willing to think how long this secret could be kept. After Feng Luan left, Lin Yun flew into the central courtyard. This was a courtyard built beside a spiritual lake.

There was a pavilion in the courtyard with the spiritual lake outside the window. Looking out the window, one could see the boundless sky right away.

“This is a nice place!” Lil’ Purple flew out of the sword box with satisfaction in her pupils. She nodded her head as if she was looking at her own home.

“How’s Lil’ Red?” Lin Yun asked.

After Lil’ Red emerged from the cocoon, it had turned into a fat black cat, a completely different image from when it was still a Dragon-Blooded Horse. But Lin Yun was already used to calling it Lil’ Red.

“It’ll be in the Dragon Pulse Realm once it wakes up.” Lil’ Purple replied as she sat on the soft fur mat, curling into a ball in a comfortable position.

Lin Yun couldn’t help feeling envious when he heard that. For Lil’ Red to reach the Dragon Pulse Realm so easily. Since Lil’ Red had a dragon bloodline, it didn’t have to accumulate stars after reaching the Heavenly Elysium Core Realm. So this meant that it could make a direct breakthrough into the Dragon Pulse Realm. Now that he thought about it again, Lil’ Red was the ultimate winner of this Saint Pool Baptism.

Lil’ Purple laid on the fur mat and yawned before stretching her waist. She was about to fall asleep again in just a brief moment.

But Lin Yun quickly shook her awake and asked, “Don’t sleep, yet. I have to ask you, what’s with the cauldron?”

“This empress is sleepy. Don’t disturb my sleep.”

“Don’t sleep, yet!”

“You scumbag! All you know is how to bully a little girl like me. You’re not even going to let me sleep!”

“What’s with the scriptures on the cauldron? Tell me quickly, what’s going on?”

“Scriptures?” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Lin Yun was determined to figure this out today because the cauldron was popping out of his ocean of astral energy. If he used his Dragon-Phoenix Sword Aura, the cauldron would be triggered, and the destructive aura in the cauldron would flood him. If he wasn’t careful, he would be rendered a puppet of the cauldron and commit endless killings. If this went on, it was just a matter of time before he became a vessel for the cauldron.

Lil’ Purple initially wanted to brush Lin Yun off. But when she heard that scriptures appeared on the cauldron, she became sober and held onto her chin, “So there really are scriptures…”

The corner of Lin Yun’s cheeks twitched when he heard that because Lil’ Purple was too unreliable. This also made him realize that there was something weird about that cauldron!
