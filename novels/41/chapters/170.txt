Chapter 171 - Competing for People

The short sword’s attack was fatal, brimming with killing intent and refined spiritual energy. Even for Lin Yun, receiving this sword wouldn’t be easy. But a monk that no one had paid any attention to was so powerful?

The three wandering cultivators squinted their eyes and released their killing aura. They were bandits who had survived through the countless battles in the North Barren Land. Their cultivation might seem to be in the seventh orifice of the Xiantian Realm, but any of them could defeat the Ominous Three from Azure Sun County.

“Kill him!” The leader of the three emitted a terrifying aura. In the next second, the three of them simultaneously unleashed their moves and charged at the monk.

Everyone in the monastery had fear flickering in their eyes. They had heard how terrifying the North Barren Land was and how elites from all over the place would lose their lives here.

These three wandering cultivators clearly came for them, but they never expected to encounter such a strange monk. Li Wuyou grabbed his sword in order to help, only to be stopped by a hand on his shoulder.

“Calm down for now.” Lin Yun made a signal with his eyes.

“Sky Breaking Seal!” The monk formed a seal with his hands, unleashing an aura familiar to Lin Yun. The monk suddenly started to release a golden glow along with a mighty aura, forcing everyone to look away.

But just when the monk was about to release his aura completely to blow apart the monastery, the aura suddenly drew back into his body.

The monk smiled. His left hand dashed out like a violet dragon tearing apart the surface of the water. Dragon roars echoed in the sky, tearing the killing aura of the three bandits apart.

Taking a step forward, the monk slammed his fist into the leader of the bandits. His fist exploded, scattering a dazzling brilliance into the surrounding. Everyone, including Lin Yun, was swept by the ripple.

Lin Yun might be able to withstand the shock with his Thunderblitz Battle Physique, but others would definitely be caught by surprise and suffer heavy injuries. But surprisingly, the shock spread out. The shock was well-controlled as it poured into the leader’s body.

In the next second, the man turned into dust and no trace of him was left behind. This scene left the two other men terrified. This monk was clearly a cultivator in the Profound Martial Realm!

They wanted to flee for their lives, but was that even possible now? The monk had only used his left fist. He was still executing his killing move with his right fist.

Boom!

A tiger’s roar accompanied the right fist. Remaining firmly on the ground, the monk threw his right fist at the two bandits on the ground. A tiger’s image could be vaguely seen leaping out from his right fist.

Flying Dragon, Leaping Tiger!

Lin Yun instantly recognized this move. This was the Dragon-Tiger Fist’s third move, the move that he’d completed in the Sky-Piercer Altar. But it was nothing compared to the monk. He was shocked at how the monk condensed his energy onto a single person. This Dragon-Tiger Fist was utterly different from what he had cultivated.

The Sky Breaking Seal? Lin Yun suddenly recalled how the monk first made a seal before he attacked. The Dragon-Tiger Fist wasn’t just a fist technique, it also came with seals and a sutra.

The Undying Vajra Seal that he knew belonged to one of the Dragon-Tiger Fist’s seals. He still vividly remembered how the Ferocious Tiger Fist was comparable to an Advanced Xiantian Martial Technique when he performed it with the seal back then.

But even so, the current scene delivered a greater shock. He never knew that the Dragon-Tiger Fist was such a terrifying martial technique.

“Did I startle any of you?” The monk killed the three bandits and looked at the youths on the ground. They were all dumbfounded.

“May I ask if you’re someone from the Heavenly Profound Sect?”

“S-senior, I-is that the Dragon-Tiger Fist? Holy shit!”

“W-w-we’re sorry for not recognizing your great presence earlier…”

The youths were all at a loss. Then again, they couldn’t be blamed. Even someone like Lin Yun, who had gone through countless life and death experiences, was shocked by this scene.

“There’s no need to call me senior. I’m not any older than any of you here.”

“How can we address you? Do you have a Buddhist name?”

“I already forgot my Buddhist name. Cultivators in Heavenly Qin County call me Drifting Goblet.” The monk smiled.

Drifting Goblet! Lin Yun’s brows twitched when he heard that name. The capital had eight titled figures. They were the eight youngest representatives of the four prominent sects and Heavenly Qin Institute. They were the absolute strongest.

Even Bai Lixuan and Si Xueyi weren’t among them. Then again, that was also because those two were still too young. However, they had a high chance of making the eight in the future.

When the monk revealed his identity, all the youths felt dizzy. They never expected that they would meet a legendary figure in this place!

Even Lin Yun never expected that the monk who reminded them to close the door would be one of the eight capital’s prominent figures. But judging from the monk’s strength, he should be telling the truth.

“Big Brother Drifting Goblet, does being bald make you stronger?” Li Wuyou asked weakly. The youths present were all overwhelmed with excitement.

When Drifting Goblet heard those words, the corner of his lips twitched. Squeezing out a smile, he replied, “There’s no need to make yourself bald. I’m not exactly a monk myself. I only have deep research in Dharma.”

Lin Yun nearly laughed out when he heard those words. Li Wuyou was simply too interesting. He even dared to joke around with the monk. Lin Yun couldn’t imagine how things would turn out if Drifting Goblet was enraged by those words.

However, Drifting Goblet was clearly not that petty. He smiled and asked, “What do you guys think of my Dragon-Tiger Fist?”

“Powerful!” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Horrifying!”

“Invincible!”

All the youths started praising.

“What do you guys think of joining the Heavenly Profound Sect?” Drifting Goblet wore a satisfied smile. But as he said those words, his eyes were fixed on Lin Yun and Li Wuyou.

“We can join the Heavenly Profound Sect?” The other youths became excited, especially after witnessing Drifting Goblet’s strength.

“Isn’t it a little too much for the Heavenly Profound Sect to send one of the eight figures to recruit disciples?” A crisp voice sounded above the monastery.

A voluptuous woman stood on a beam. Donned in a sky blue dress, she jumped down. When she landed on the ground, her ample chest trembled lightly. This view had instantly attracted everyone’s gaze. Li Wuyou even went as far as gulping down mouthfuls of saliva.

Captivating everyone’s gaze with her smile, the woman introduced herself, “I’m Xin Yan. I belong to the Sword Firmament Pavilion. If any of you are interested in joining the Sword Firmament Pavilion, I can open a backdoor for you.”

The woman emanated a captivating charm. Even her voice was bewitching.

“The Sword Firmament Pavilion isn’t any better to send the Bella of the sect out… On the other hand, there’s nothing attractive about old drunkards of my Primal Origin Sect.” A sloppy old man walked out from the grass, covered in the smell of alcohol.

The Heavenly Profound Sect’s Drifting Goblet, the Primal Origin Sect’s Old Drunkard, and the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s Xin Yan. Three representatives from the four prominent sects had gathered in this small monastery, catching everyone by surprise. No one had expected that there were two other people hidden in the monastery.

“Big sister, I’ll come with you!” Li Wuyou stood up while everyone was stunned. He walked towards the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s Xin Yan.

“You have a good taste, lad.” Xin Yan stretched her hand out.

Li Wuyou immediately held onto her hand and chuckled, “Nice to meet you. I’m Li Wuyou. In the future, I will be the strongest swordsman in the Great Qin Empire.”

“Do you want me to chop off your hands?” Xin Yan smiled. She looked at Li Wuyou, who did not want to release his hand.

Sensing the killing intent blowing at him, Li Wuyou immediately let go of her hand.

“Hehe, how obedient. But you’re pretty lecherous for your age.” Xin Yan pinched Li Wuyou’s cheeks, causing Li Wuyou to start screaming out in pain.

Looking at this scene, Drifting Goblet and the Old Drunkard sighed in pity. Seeing that Lin Yun was heading in Xin Yan’s direction, Drifting Goblet spoke out, “You must have learned the Dragon-Tiger Fist as well. Why don’t you join the Heavenly Profound Sect? You can learn the full version there.”

“Don’t listen to him. The Dragon-Tiger Fist might be strong, but it’s hard to learn. You must know how to cherish your life. More importantly, only those with karma tied to Buddhism can learn it. That means that if you join the Heavenly Profound Sect, you will have to shave your head bald.” The Primal Origin Sect’s Old Drunkard smiled, “Looking at your physique, it will be a pity if you don’t join the Primal Origin Sect. The Primal Origin Sect is the strongest in the Great Qin Empire when it comes to physiques.”

The two went up to issue their invitation, leaving the other youths in shock. It was then that they realized that these three only came for Lin Yun and Li Wuyou. As for them, they were only passersby. They couldn’t help feeling disappointed when they realized this.

On the other hand, Lin Yun was shocked. True enough, they were worthy of being Profound Martial Realm cultivators because they could see right through him.

Drifting Goblet and Old Drunkard had gotten a little anxious. On the other hand, Xin Yan only looked at Lin Yun with watery eyes. She did not utter a single word.

“I’m sorry. I had already made up my mind to join the Sword Firmament Pavilion before I came.” Lin Yun cupped his hands together to refuse their offer.

Hearing Lin Yun’s reply, the two couldn’t help but sigh as they shook their heads. Given their status, they wouldn’t go as far as forcing Lin Yun to join them. Furthermore, they could tell that Lin Yun had a powerful incomplete sword intent.

“You won’t regret your choice. Well then, I will be taking my leave first.” Xin Yan left with Lin Yun and Li Wuyou.

“How could anyone reject Xin Yan? What a pity for two decent seeded candidates to be snatched away,” sighed Old Drunkard.

“The Sword Firmament Pavilion’s luck has been a little too good these past few days… Oh, right. I remember someone calling me bald earlier?” Drifting Goblet smiled, sweeping his glance around.

The Old Drunkard coughed at those words. He nearly spat out the alcohol in his mouth and started changing the topic, “Don’t take it to heart. I was just joking. Weren’t you going to invite these youths to the Heavenly Profound Sect? I’ll take my leave first then.”

“Pretty quick at running,” smiled Drifting Goblet.
