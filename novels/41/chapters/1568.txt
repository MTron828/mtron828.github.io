Chapter 1569 - Divine Dragon ArtifactsGeett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Lin Yun was determined to reach the ten-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm. He devoured the boundless divine dragon spiritual liquid and circulated the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon to charge at the bronze gate.

As the gap within the bronze gate grew, the dragon aura emitted from it became even more terrifying, making Lin Yun feel uncertain. Simultaneously, he looked forward to the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon reaching the fourth stage.

He didn’t wait long because the bronze gate opened after a full circulation. His boiling vitality and raging astral energy calmed down when the bronze gate opened. Just when Lin Yun felt uncertain, a dragon flew out, bearing a dragon aura that far surpassed that of divine dragons. It was a heavenly dragon, and looking at it shocked Lin Yun greatly.

But in the next second, something unexpected occurred. The Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron tried to fly out of his astral energy ocean, and the ocean's surface formed into a golden vortex. When the cauldron slowly rose up, the Netherflower with twenty-four petals also trembled because it was losing control of the cauldron. Even the Divine Nether Sword began to vibrate at the flower’s heart.

As Lin Yun groaned, the Netherflower flew away when the heavenly dragon flew over and engraved itself on the cauldron's surface. When the heavenly dragon was inscribed on the cauldron, the cauldron released a golden brilliance and emitted a terrifying draconic aura. The entire cauldron also became more realistic.

When the cauldron descended the next moment, the astral energy ocean shattered with great bellows raging about. This made blood drip down from the corner of Lin Yun’s lips, and his face became pale because the cauldron had become heavier.

He quickly circulated the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra to calm his astral energy ocean. When the Netherflower descended, the astral energy ocean’s surface finally calmed down. Lin Yun knew that the cauldron’s power had been slightly restored, and it would be harder for him to use it in the future. But he didn’t know if it was good or bad news for him.

When he reached the fourth stage in the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon, the size of his astral energy ocean grew and became nearly forty thousand feet. Simultaneously, the nine stars in his violet palace blazed like bright suns, which was a sign that his cultivation had reached a limit.

Lin Yun tried several times, but no matter how he circulated the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon, he couldn’t budge in his cultivation, regardless of how much divine dragon spiritual liquid he absorbed. The tenth star was before him, but it was also beyond his reach.

After a brief pondering, he continued swimming, reaching two thousand meters in the Dragon Transforming Pool. The dragon flames contained here had reached a terrifying height, and the heat made his body turn red. Even with the protection of the dragon runes, his physique had reached a limit.

Raising his head, he could only see darkness, as though this place was isolated from the outside world. Not even the Heavenly Pool Saint Lord could see what was going on here unless he entered the Dragon Transforming Pool. But Lin Yun couldn’t stay here for long, or he would be turned to ashes. In just this short moment, several dragon runes had already melted.

“It’s this terrifying?” Lin Yun muttered, and he quickly activated the Blue Dragon Bone with the Azure Dragon Saint Art. Within the Dragon Transforming Pool, the Blue Dragon Bone was simply a cheat when used to devour divine dragon spiritual liquid. This speed was something that no one could imagine.

But since he wasn’t deep enough before, he didn’t dare to use it, fearing that the Heavenly Pool Saint Lord might discover his Blue Dragon Bone. But now that he was two thousand meters deep within the pool, he no longer had such concerns. When the Blue Dragon Bone became active, the surrounding divine dragon spiritual liquid poured into his body.

He didn’t have to do anything for the divine dragon spiritual liquid to come to him. As the divine dragon spiritual liquid entered his body, more dragon runes were being produced from within the Blue Dragon Bone when he circulated the Azure Dragon Saint Art. This instantly brought Lin Yun joy because the process was smoother than he had imagined.

When the dragon runes reached thirty thousand, he reached a bottleneck, and the dragon runes wouldn’t increase no matter how he tried. His cultivation, physique, sword intent, and sword sutras had reached a bottleneck, all reaching his limit.

“Does the tenth star really exist?” Lin Yun muttered with his confidence shaken. He asked Lil’ Purple, “Empress, does the tenth star really exist?”

“It does.” Lil’ Purple replied. “But that was in ancient times, and modern times cannot be compared to ancient times. In ancient times, the Sword Sect’s saint disciples could easily achieve the tenth star. But the density of spiritual energy in modern times cannot be compared to the Golden Era. The spiritual energy hasn’t recovered.”

“Let me give it a try.” Lin Yun wasn’t willing to give up and continued to sink down into the pool, reaching three thousand meters. There was no longer water here but golden divine dragon spiritual liquid and domineering dragon flames.

With a rough estimation, Lin Yun speculated that he could only stay here for half an hour with thirty thousand dragon runes. If the dragon runes dropped by more than twenty thousand, he would dissolve into blood.

The dragon runes on the surface of his body were swiftly dissolving, and the new dragon runes produced in the Blue Dragon Bone couldn’t keep up with the dissolving speed.

Lin Yun quickly shut his eyes to circulate the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon, trying to expand the scale of his astral energy ocean. He didn’t dare to push his cultivation because he could easily reach the Dragon Pulse Realm with a gentle shove. So he could only use this crude method to suppress his cultivation and expand his astral energy ocean to see if he could condense the tenth star. If he failed, he could only leave, or his life would be threatened.

But no matter how much he tried to devour the divine dragon spiritual liquid, his astral energy ocean was still stuck at forty thousand feet like an abyssal blackhole.

“Lin Yun, we must leave now, or we’ll be in trouble.” Lil’ Purple’s voice echoed within Lin Yun’s mind. “Every era has its rules. Even if this era doesn’t have the tenth star, it doesn’t affect you becoming a top-tiered powerhouse. Your astral energy ocean is already at an exaggerated scale, and the tenth star won’t be any more powerful than you.”

“I wish to try again.” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with reluctance. He even circulated the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra and started controlling the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron. The cauldron merely shook briefly with ripples spreading across the astral energy ocean.

The immense weight made it taxing for Lin Yun to try and control it. Meanwhile, his dragon runes were swiftly dissolving, soon reaching an alarming level. Right then, Lin Yun resorted to using his dual sword souls, and the cauldron finally rose.

But he was only left with ten thousand dragon runes, and the dragon runes born from the Blue Dragon Bone couldn’t keep up with the dissolving speed. This made Lin Yun inwardly curse before he hastened his pace.

When the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron finally rose from the ocean, the heavenly dragon engraved on it radiated brightly, filling his body with an ancient destructive power.

“Come!” Lin Yun’s body was like a funnel, devouring all the divine dragon spiritual liquid and dragon flames within the surroundings. But it was too messy, like unfiltered magma-like water pouring into his body. His face was dark, but he gritted his teeth and held on.

But he still couldn’t reach the tenth star. After calming down with reluctance in his pupils, the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Cauldron slowly sank into the astral energy ocean. “It looks like it’s time for me to give up.”

He clasped his hands together, wanting to protect himself with astral energy to reduce the damage on his body before leaving. But a loud sound echoed from Lin Yun’s body right then, like when the universe was first created.

Suddenly, the tenth star appeared in the sky within his violet palace, and his astral energy ocean began to start rumbling, growing to fifty thousand feet with waves of astral energy filling his body. This left Lin Yun stunned because he didn’t think he would succeed. It turned out that the tenth star really did exist, and the legend was true.

Lin Yun rejoiced when he came to his senses. He was fortunate that he was cautious and chose to reach three thousand meters deep within the pool before trying to make a breakthrough. If news of this gets out, it would draw everyone’s attention.

Compared to the fame of achieving ten-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm, Lin Yun would rather stay low profile because there were too many people who wanted his life in the Ancient Barren Domain. If news of him condensing the tenth star spreads, he wasn’t sure if someone might not make a move against him, despite the risk of suffering the Sword Sect’s revenge.

“This is pretty good. I’ll quietly make a breakthrough to the Dragon Pulse Realm here.” Lin Yun muttered with his eyes flickering. When he closed his eyes and tried to break into the Dragon Pulse Realm, he didn’t notice that the Dragon Transforming Pool was affected when he condensed the tenth star. Light was glittering beneath the pool with a surging undercurrent.

Meanwhile, Cang Yun and the others were all trying to make a breakthrough after refining enough divine dragon spiritual liquid. They could make a breakthrough to the Dragon Pulse Realm if they wanted, but they weren’t in a hurry because they wanted to condense dragon origin when reaching the Dragon Pulse Realm.

As time flowed, three days passed in the blink of an eye. Nangong Yan was the first to open his eyes, releasing an aura of the Dragon Pulse Realm. When the Heavenly Blade Pavilion’s disciples rushed over, the leader of the Heavenly Blade Pavilion, Zhang Xuan, asked, “Did you succeed?”

“I did.” Nangong Yan nodded.

“How much did you convert?” Zhang Xuan asked with excitement on his face.

“Thirty percent!”

“Hahaha! Converting 30% upon reaching the Dragon Pulse Realm. I bet your dragon pulse is at least three feet!” Zhang Xuan said with joy on his face.

It was impressive if someone could convert 10% upon reaching the Dragon Pulse Realm, and Nangong Yan had converted 30%. Everyone else in the pool opened their eyes one by one, and the leaders of their sects immediately came forth.

“Ziling, how much did you convert?” Mu Xueqin asked.

“Roughly about 40%.” Ye Ziling replied after briefly closing her eyes to sense her dragon pulse.

“Good!” Mu Xueqin had joy on her face as she turned to the other disciples. Ji Shuxuan converted 20%, Jiang Cheng converted 20%, and Ye Ziyun converted 20%. Everyone turned to look at Zhao Yan after that.

Zhao Yan briefly hesitated before he replied, “About 30%.”

“Good. Nangong Yan only converted 30%, and I bet Ye Ziling converted the most. Circulate your dragon origin, and let me see.” Mu Xueqin smiled.

Since everyone had reached the Dragon Pulse Realm, dragon pulses appeared behind them when they triggered their dragon origins. When their Dragon Pulse Realm auras exploded, draconic roars could be faintly heard echoing about.

“The Dragon Transforming Pool is impressive, indeed.” Luo Yuan took a deep glance at the Sword Sect’s saint disciples. Upon reaching the Dragon Pulse Realm, they all had condensed dragon origin, and Ye Ziling had converted about 40% dragon origin.

This gathering was too disfavorable to the Profound Sky Sect, and Luo Yuan squinted his eyes. The Profound Sky Sect wasn’t afraid of losing once. But it would be troublesome if they kept being suppressed by the Sword Sect, especially by Lin Yun. If Lin Yun wasn’t around, the Sword Sect would be ranked at the bottom of this gathering.

Just when Luo Yuan was searching for Lin Yun, an outburst of light exploded from the Dragon Transforming Pool, and several items flew out. Each one of them was a treasure that contained a pure dragon aura.

“Divine Dragon Artifacts!” The various sects’ disciples exclaimed after a brief stun.
