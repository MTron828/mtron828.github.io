Chapter 1330 - What the Hell?!

When Dugu Yan opened his eyes, the entire sky became dark, and even the light emitted from the Great Saint Origin was covered up. At the same time, azure bolts of lightning descended from the sky before forming into flames in mid-air.

At the same time, Dugu Yan emitted a terrifying sword intent. Empowered by his Azure Thunder Sword Eyes, his sky sword intent actually reached the level of firmament sword intent! At this moment, Dugu Yan gave everyone a feeling that he was the heavens, and all lives were beneath him.

When he said ‘kneel’, his words sounded as if it was filled with magic that echoed across the horizon. Many people couldn’t take it and threw out a mouthful of blood on the spot with their faces becoming pale. They had already distanced themselves the moment Dugu Yan opened his eyes, but they were still caught in the shockwave. His words that were further empowered by his sword intent that was close to firmament sword intent sounded like the roar of heaven.

Cracks began to appear on the ground and the boundless sword aura came crashing down towards Lin Yun. This was simply too fast. Before they could even consider it properly, the boundless sword aura had already enveloped and devoured him. This made everyone’s faces change as they exclaimed, thinking that Lin Yun was finished.

But something bizarre occurred. When the boundless sword aura was about to land on Lin Yun, the sword aura suddenly froze like ice and couldn’t envelop Lin Yun in it. Right at this moment, a dragon roar resounded from within Lin Yun’s body and the three thousand purple-golden dragon runes left him, forming into a thirty-foot azure dragon that emitted a dragon aura.

When the dragon aura roared, it instantly destroyed the boundless aura that came from Dugu Yan. Then, Lin Yun raised his hand and pushed his hand forth, controlling the azure dragon to fly towards Dugu Yan while enveloped in the power of thunderstorms.

This made Dugu Yan’s face drastically change, and his knee was falling towards the ground, causing him to quickly grab onto a saint sword with his left hand.

“Kneel!” Lin Yun waved his hand without any expression. When the azure dragon opened its mouth, it unleashed a roar that was filled with violence and ferocity. Dugu Yan could hear the azure dragon’s heartbeat, which made this azure dragon look vivid. Before Dugu Yan could even draw his sword, he fell to the ground with one knee. Just like that, Dugu Yan held onto the sword hilt with his left hand and plunged to the ground with his face distorted from the pain.

Dugu Yan had actually kneeled. This instantly made everyone take in a cold breath with their faces changed. They couldn’t believe this scene. Dugu Yan caught everyone by surprise when he unleashed his Azure Thunder Sword Eyes, but Lin Yun’s surprise was even bigger. He instantly made Dugu Yan fall on his knee.

No one thought that Dugu Yan would be the one to kneel instead, and this was too humiliating. At the same time, Dugu Yan’s face was also ugly as he tried to struggle to his feet while resisting the dragon aura.

His body was like a massive mountain enveloped in a boundless sword aura. When he struggled, the ground began to tremble. But he still failed to get back on his feet. The azure dragon was emitting a torrential pressure from its pupils, causing Dugu Yan to be unable to unleash his sword aura.

“You’re courting death!” Dugu Yan burst into rage and couldn’t hold it back from summoning his constellation anymore. When a painting unfolded behind him, it was rather simple. It was a sword with an azure moon hanging in the sky.

When the painting bloomed, Dugu Yan slammed his left palm on the ground and he bounced back to his feet. At the same time, he clenched his right fist together and threw out a punch, unleashing an azure sun with his fist.

When the azure dragon took the attack head-on, the azure dragon released a howl before it was blown back. Everyone was inwardly alarmed by the strength that Dugu Yan had unleashed after summoning his constellation.

Lin Yun tapped his foot on the ground before he soared to the sky. He landed on the azure dragon that was sent flying back. When his sword intent empowered this azure dragon, the cracks that appeared on the azure dragon under Dugu Yan’s attack quickly recovered.

“You’re strong, but you’ll still lose to me!” Dugu Yan’s eyes shone brightly as he looked at Lin Yun. But Lin Yun didn’t bother with him. A painting was unfolding behind him. When Dugu Yan saw this scene, he coldly said, “You don’t believe me? I can easily suppress you with the difference between our cultivations. Even if I’m not at the Elysium Core Realm, I can still easily suppress you if I wanted to.”

“Kneel.” Lin Yun suddenly spoke out.

Before everyone could figure out what was going on, Dugu Yan fell to the ground once more, and fine cracks even appeared on the painting behind him. When they turned to look at Lin Yun again, they saw a golden painting that had appeared behind him. It was the Aurora Dragon painting of the Heaven Burial Constellation.

Just like that, Dugu Yan fell on one knee again. But how was that possible? The audience couldn’t believe that Dugu Yan instantly lost in a confrontation between constellations, and this had exceeded everyone’s expectations. This was something that not even Dugu Yan had thought about.

“Mhm?” Qin Cang at the Profound Sky Sect’s faction was surprised and turned to look at the golden painting behind Lin Yun. He could sense the aura that belonged to Sovereign Constellations was coming from the painting. But he had never heard of an Aurora Dragon constellation amongst the hundred Sovereign Constellations.

Just when everyone was feeling uneasy, Dugu Yan held onto the sword hilt and drew the sword out by half an inch, bearing with the aura of the Aurora Dragon painting. It was a saint sword, and the sword shone brightly, allowing his constellation that showed cracks to recover. When he drew the sword halfway out, Dugu Yan was able to get back on his feet once more.

“Die!” Dugu Yan’s hair was violently fluttering in the wind, and he had unleashed all his strength at this moment without holding back.

“Kneel again,” said Lin Yun calmly. When he said that, he soared to the sky once more and disappeared on the azure dragon. When he reappeared, he drew out the Lightning Shadow Sword and swung it at Dugu Yan’s half-drawn sword.

As sparks flew, the divine rune on the Lightning Shadow Sword shone, and Dugu Yan’s painting, which had recovered, collapsed once more. Throwing out a mouthful of blood, Dugu Yan was forced to the ground once more under the sword aura released by the Lightning Shadow Sword. But this time, he wasn’t that lucky. Both of his knees were on the ground.

Just like that, Lin Yun was hovering in mid-air as the Lightning Shadow Sword shone brightly, making him look like a deity while Dugu Yan kneeled before him. This made everyone’s jaws drop once more because Dugu Yan was on his knees for the third time.

Just like that, Dugu Yan, who was known to be invincible in the sword and even claimed that he would make Lin Yun beg for his life, fell on his knees for the third time. This was no longer a fight but a one-sided humiliation for Dugu Yan. At this moment, Lin Yun was humiliating Dugu Yan on purpose with no intentions of clashing head-on.

This scene made everyone take in a cold breath with a chill down their spines because Dugu Yan was a little too pitiful. After all, there had never been a fated transcendent being humiliated in this manner in the Ancient Barren Domain.

“You’ve thoroughly enraged me!” Dugu Yan roared as the Azure Thunder Sacred Flames began to gather in his pupils, making his eyes look like two revolving suns. At the same time, a terrifying aura was also emitted from his eyes that made heaven and earth tremble.

“Azure Thunder Annihilation!” Dugu Yan roared, and the light from the two ‘suns’ in his eyes reached a limit.

But facing Dugu Yan, Lin Yun loosened his grip on the Lightning Shadow Sword and gave Dugu Yan a slap without any hesitation. The slap made Dugu Yan throw out a mouthful of blood, and he began to spin in mid-air from the sheer force of Lin Yun’s slap.

His eyes shone two devastating beams, but since Dugu Yan couldn’t control his body, the two beams began to rotate along with Dugu Yan. Everything that the devastating beams came into contact with began to crumble and cut apart.

“What power!” The audience members were shocked when they saw this scene. They had a feeling that even fated transcendents would die if they were hit by the beams. But it was a pity that he was sent flying with a slap before the beams could land on Lin Yun.

This also made them wonder how strong Lin Yun had become for him to toy with Dugu Yan in his hands.

“What’s going on?” Nangong Ze, Ning Feng, and Zhang Jin’s faces changed as they turned their gazes over.

But Lin Yun had no intention of letting Dugu Yan go and sheathed the Lightning Shadow Sword before unleashing the Azure Dragon Grasp with his right hand. As the thirty-foot azure dragon returned to his body and returned to being three thousand purple-golden dragon runes, the dragon runes began to surge towards his hand.

As thunderstorms began to converge, a dragon claw was formed that headed for Dugu Yan. No matter what, Dugu Yan was a genius comparable to fated transcendents, so he was able to move about after being forced to a dead end. As sword rays began to flicker on his body, thunder and flames began to accumulate at the center of his brows.

Dugu Yan still had a lot of trump cards he hadn’t shown, so he wasn’t convinced if he lost to Lin Yun in this manner. Just when he dodged the dragon claw, he furiously roared in his heart with raging hatred accumulating within.

But it was futile. Lin Yun merely tugged with his right hand and Dugu Yan was like a magnet sucked into the dragon claw. When Lin Yun clenched his hand, the dragon claw manifested from the three thousand purple-golden dragon runes and dragged Dugu Yan back.

Dugu Yan was clearly a few thousand meters away just a moment ago. But when Lin Yun clenched his fist, Dugu Yan was dragged back and Lin Yun was now grabbing onto Dugu Yan’s throat.

“L-Let me go!” Dugu Yan began to panic with despair as his legs were dangling in mid-air.

When Lin Yun swept his gaze over, Lil’ Red was giving Zhang Jin a beating while Nangong Ze was entirely suppressed by Su Ziyao. Only Ning Feng managed to withstand Ye Ziling’s attacks thanks to the ancient armor he was wearing, and this gave Ye Ziling a headache.

Seeing this scene, Lin Yun suddenly had an idea and tossed Dugu Yan toward Ning Feng like a spear. At the same time, Dugu Yan was also empowered by the azure dragon’s aura, along with thunder and flames, and flew towards Ning Feng in the manner of a humanoid spear.

When Ning Feng, who was fighting Ye Ziling, saw this scene, he instantly exclaimed out in shock, “Holy, what the hell?!”
