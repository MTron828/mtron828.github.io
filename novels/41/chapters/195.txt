Chapter 196 - Kill!

When the white-clothed swordsman removed the white faceless mask, a face that no one had expected appeared. It was Lin Yun. On the stage, Han Mo and Han Feng rubbed their eyes. They still thought that their eyes were playing tricks on them. After repeated confirmations, they finally believed that the white-clothed swordsman was Lin Yun.

“How is he here after being driven into the Sword Burial Woods by us…?” Mo Qingyun was equally shocked. The faces of all ten Profound Martial Realms changed, including Huangfu Jingxuan.

They personally witnessed how Lin Yun was forced into the Sword Burial Woods. However, Lin Yun was standing in front of them, alive and well. His appearance was a slap to their faces. Not only did he come out alive, he even reached the Profound Martial Realm.

All of them shuddered when they recalled Lin Yun’s cold gaze the other day and how Leng Mo was currently lying on the ground in pain.

Feng Haoyu, who nearly killed Li Wuyou, wore an ugly expression. “How did this guy make it out?”

While some of their faces were ugly, there were also those who rejoiced. The depression between Xin Yan’s brows had disappeared. “He actually made it out… But his retaliation is really ruthless.”

From the moment she came into contact with Lin Yun, she could sense the latter’s calmness. Even if he suffered grievance in the capital, he still endured it. But anyone who thought he was a pushover would be making a huge mistake.

This could be seen by the way that Lin Yun was getting his revenge. The Dragon Blooded Horse was stabbed by a spear from Leng Mo, so Lin Yun pierced Leng Mo with a spear in the same way. The only difference was that the pain that Leng Mo was suffering was a whole lot worse.

The next victim would be Wang Ning. No matter who stepped forward, no one could dispel Lin Yun’s thoughts of killing Wang Ning.

When Lin Yun removed his mask, Wang Ning was completely frightened. Didn’t they say that the Sword Burial Woods was a forbidden ground? How did Lin Yun make it out? Wang Ning only knew that he couldn’t die. He had a good status and he was the direct descendant of the Wang Clan.

“Stop!” Wang Yan shouted when he saw that Lin Yun showed no signs of mercy. However, Lin Yun paid no attention to Wang Yan and stabbed his sword into Wang Ning’s chest.

But just as he raised his wrist, Lin Yun turned around to see two figures charging at him. They were Han Mo and Han Feng. Back in the forest, they were the first two to target him. The moment the two made their moves, the other Profound Martial Realms acted out as well.

Earlier on, no one wanted to act rashly as they had no idea who the white-clothed swordsman was. But after finding out that it was Lin Yun, they naturally couldn’t give him a way out. They were the ones who forced Lin Yun into a dead-end, so they knew that there was no way they could settle this matter peacefully.

So rather than sitting and waiting, they took the initiative. Those who could reach the Profound Martial Realm at such a young age were decisive, so they made their choices without any hesitation.

Taking advantage of the distraction, Wang Ning rolled on the ground and shouted, “Hurry up and murder this sword slave! We will never have peace if he’s not dead! If anyone is willing to…”

Lin Yun glanced at Wang Ning casually before flicking his finger. A violet sword flash reached Wang Ning in the blink of an eye. Seeing the sword flash, Wang Ning immediately shut up and dodged the sword flash.

The sword flash nearly pierced his heart. It only managed to pierce through his chest, tormenting Wang Ning with immense pain.

“You’re not dead?” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed coldly as he wanted to follow up with another attack, but Han Mo and Han Feng’s attacks arrived right at this moment. If Lin Yun continued to go after Wang Ning, he would be leaving his back exposed. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Back in the forest, the two brothers willingly became Wang Ning’s lapdogs and made things difficult for him because their cultivation was in the Profound Martial Realm. Naturally, they wouldn’t let Lin Yun off again. Due to the fact that Lin Yun was distracted, he was pushed three steps back from their attacks.

“And here I thought you had grown stronger. So it turns out that you're nothing much.” Han Mo and Han Feng stood shoulder to shoulder. Looking at Lin Yun being pushed back by their attacks, they sneered, “Shouldn’t you cherish your life since you made it out of the Sword Burial Woods?”

Feng Haoyu, Mo Qingyun, and the other Profound Martial Realms also came. As long as the two of them could hold up Lin Yun briefly, they would be able to besiege Lin Yun again.

“Joining hands?” The elders and senior disciples of the Sword Firmament Pavilion were shocked by this scene. They didn’t believe it when they heard that Wang Ning had joined hands with ten Profound Martial Realms to pursue a fifth orifice Xiantian Realm.

But now, they were witnessing how these people cooperated to kill Lin Yun. If this was the first time that they were working together, it wouldn’t be possible for them to have such rapport.

“Damn it!” Xin Yan’s face darkened. She didn’t expect something so shameless to take place in her eyes. Next to Bai Ting, Wang Yan’s nervous expression gradually eased. He spoke out indifferently, “A clown is still a clown. I’ll see how you survive this!”

Without any warning, three bursts of lightning echoed out from the stage, with afterimages densely packed together. Lin Yun stood his ground at Han Mo and Han Feng’s ridicule. He merely waved his hand and charged over with the Thunderclap Sword Art.

With a flick of his wrist, he swung his sword three times. Every single swing separated into eighty-one afterimages and created over two hundred afterimages. Han Mo and Han Feng narrowed their eyes into slits. Lin Yun’s attacks had caught them by surprise.

But that wasn’t enough. The Iris Flower in Lin Yun’s Dantian blossomed and unleashed six more attacks. He had pushed the Iris Sword Art to the limit. His sword was like a ferocious dragon, releasing a pressure that made Han Mo and Han Feng feel suffocated.

Han Mo and Han Feng’s faces changed. Facing such attacks, they didn’t even have any thoughts of fighting back. But it was already too late for them to react.

The two of them were hit and they vomited a mouthful of blood. They clenched their teeth and brandished their swords, trying to retaliate in this juncture of life and death. The two were brothers indeed. When they joined hands together, their rapport reached a whole new level.

However, Lin Yun’s sword was gradually getting faster. The two brothers were already having a difficult time handling the first sword, so the second sword, Drifting Flowers, would only double in pressure.

Lin Yun’s sword flashed and caught the brothers by surprise. They had no idea who Lin Yun’s sword was aiming for. When the sword collided, Han Mo was blown away with blood splattering from his chest.

Not giving Han Feng any time to react, Lin Yun executed the Thunderclap Sword Art’s third sword, Descending Snow. The vast power behind the sword not only had the agility of snow, but also transformed into a sea of clouds. At the same time, more spirituality accompanied his attacks. Taking the hit, Han Feng was blasted away.

Lin Yun immediately followed up with Moon Chasing. His figure dashed out like a bolt of lightning, appearing before Han Mo. As soon as Han Mo fell to the ground, hundreds of sword flashes burst out from his body, along with splattering blood. It was unknown if Han Mo was still alive.

Four moves. Lin Yun only used four moves to defeat Han Mo and Han Feng. They weren’t like Wang Ning, who relied on the Profound Breaking Pellet to make his breakthrough. They had a sturdy foundation and excellent sword techniques. Additionally, the rapport that they had was something that was even more difficult to nurture.

However, they were easily defeated by Lin Yun. Then again, this had also created an excellent opportunity for the six remaining Profound Martial Realms to make their moves.

“Kill him!” With Mo Qingyun and Feng Haoyu taking the lead, the six Profound Martial Realms charged over. With origin energy rippling through the surroundings, they summoned their Martial Souls.

The six of them had unleashed their strongest move at once, which created a huge commotion and left cracks on the ground beneath Lin Yun. If Lin Yun was even hit by one of their attacks, he would be heavily injured. No one had any idea how Lin Yun was going to get out of this perilous situation.

Lin Yun merely waved his hand at this. When his sleeves fluttered, a loud rumble could be heard. It was an explosion that combined the gale, flower, snow, and moon. It was the last sword in the Thunderclap Sword Art—Divine Firmament.

The attacks from the six Profound Martial Realms were only half a meter away from Lin Yun when the rumbling lightning sent shocks into their bodies, causing them to bleed through their orifices. They became deaf in both ears and their vision blurred. They wailed in pain while covering their ears. The rumble buzzed in their mind like an explosion.

On the stage, the other newcomers had distanced themselves from the storm. But the sudden rumble had caught them by surprise, leaving them with a splitting headache and shaking eardrums. The remaining puppets also trembled from the rumble before they disintegrated into pieces.

Huangfu Jingxuan clapped while he walked out. His applause had drawn the spectators’ attention. At this moment, they realized that Huangfu Jingxuan had yet to make his move. Huangfu Jingxuan had grasped the incomplete sword intent and he was stronger than the other Profound Martial Realms here. He naturally had the qualifications to be prideful.

“It’s impressive that you can have your current strength with a garbage Martial Soul. However, that’s the end of it…” A melodious sword ring echoed out. Huangfu Jingxuan drew his sword and unleashed his incomplete sword intent.

His hair fluttered in the wind and under the incomplete sword intent, he was like a sharp sword.

“Right, Huangfu Jingxuan is still left. He’s more than enough for this!” Wang Yan’s hope was rekindled. Swordsmen would rather die than go against their hearts.

But all of a sudden, a horrifying sword aura exploded from Lin Yun. It was the complete sword intent. When the elders and senior disciples saw that, they jumped up on their feet with shock in their eyes. They finally knew why Lin Yun was so powerful.

Waving his hand, Lin Yun’s sword, empowered by the complete sword intent, shattered Huangfu Jingxuan’s incomplete sword intent and stabbed into his chest. All of this took place in an instant. There was no suspense between the incomplete and complete sword intent.

Lin Yun swept his glance out and replied indifferently, “Don’t bother acting before me. You might have a 50% chance at defeating me if you’re willing to join hands with them. As of now, I can defeat you easily with a single sword. Since you planted your sword intent in my brother’s body back then, I’ll let you have a taste of your own medicine!”

The Flower Burial Sword began to buzz in Huangfu Jingxuan’s chest while Lin Yun injected his sword intent into the former’s body. Huangfu Jingxuan’s face was distorted with pain. He fell onto his knees with a horrid look in his eyes. He could sense the complete sword intent gradually growing within his body.

“S-s-save me…” Huangfu Jingxuan looked at Lin Yun in despair, begging with his eyes. He knew how terrifying this sword intent was. The pride he displayed a minute ago was now laughable to him.

However, Lin Yun ignored Huangfu Jingxuan and turned to look at Wang Ning. The latter stumbled while running towards the stage’s border. He was just one step away from leaving the barrier.

When he saw Lin Yun look over, Wang Ning stopped and smirked at him. So what if Lin Yun comprehended the complete sword intent? There was still nothing Lin Yun could do to him. He sneered, “I know you want to kill me, but unfortunately, you won’t get your wish today. We have plenty of time in the future, so I’ll play with you slowly in the Sword Firmament Pavilion. In my eyes, you’re just a piece of garbage!”

Before he finished his words, he already turned around and started to jump off the stage. As long as he jumped off the stage, Elder Bai Ting and his elder brother Wang Yan would protect him. It would be impossible for Lin Yun to kill him.

“Go back!” Li Wuyou flew into the air, charging towards the barrier and kicking Wang Ning’s chest. Wang Ning was knocked back like a sandbag. After rolling for tens of meters, he raised his head to face Lin Yun’s cold gaze.

All of a sudden, Wang Ning’s soul left his body in fright. He could see the murderous intent in Lin Yun’s eyes.
