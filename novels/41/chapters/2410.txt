Chapter 2411 - Heaven’s Gate Ancestral Palace

When everyone came to their senses from Luo Tianxi’s words, their faces changed because this was imprisonment for a hundred years in the Blood Purgatory Ruins. That was where Heaven’s Gate imprisoned severe criminals. Once imprisoned, it was impossible to escape. The spiritual energy in there was sparse, and the environment was harsh. It was practically impossible to cultivate there.

A hundred years of being unable to cultivate was a heavy blow to geniuses like Feng Yuan, Jiang Yi, and Bai Yuchen. While they are imprisoned, the other geniuses from the same generation as them would rise while they remained stagnant. In other words, it was the same as being crippled.

“How ruthless!”

“I bet the three holy lands will regret it. They initially wanted to use Lin Yun as an excuse to suppress Heaven’s Gate while they didn’t have their divine son yet, and they definitely didn't expect this outcome.”

“They can’t blame anyone. If it weren’t for Lin Yun, the three would sweep through the geniuses of Heaven’s Gate and leave after causing a mess in the Heavenly Barren Banquet.”

“That’s right. At least the Heavenly Seal Emperor didn’t make a move against juniors like them, and they wouldn’t have been in this situation if they didn’t take it too far.”

“They deserve it!” No one sympathized with the three of them. This was simple because if three of them won, their name would spread throughout the three thousand realms, stepping on Heaven’s Gate and ruining the future Heavenly Barren Banquets.

“Do the three of you have any objection to that?” Luo Tianxi looked at the three coldly.

Bai Yuchen and Jiang Yi opened their mouths, but they chose to shut up after seeing the rage in the eyes of everyone from Heaven’s Gate. They were suffering from the arrogance they showed earlier, and they knew that they would be mocked if they dared to object to it.

Feng Yuan picked up his severed hand, and indifferently said, “There’s nothing to say since we’ve lost.” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Compared to Bai Yuchen and Jiang Yi, Feng Yuan was calmer.

“Even if we have any objections, it would only be directed towards Flower Burial.” Feng Yuan looked at Lin Yun, and said, “I didn’t expect him to grasp Nirvana Dao. If I was prepared...”

“There’s nothing you can do about it even if you’re prepared!” Dugu Jue spoke out before he could finish. He sneered, “Where did you get the face to express unwillingness to your failure when the three of you lost in a fight against him? If I’m not wrong, Lin Yun still has trump cards he didn’t use.”

“Who the hell are you?! Do you think that you’re qualified to talk to me?!” Feng Yuan said coldly.

“I’m not qualified?” Dugu Jue smiled, “You might not know, but I obtained a draw in my fight with Flower Burial. He and the Heavenly Seal Emperor personally acknowledged it. The three of you can’t even defeat Lin Yun, and you say I’m not qualified? I fought him to a draw even if I didn’t make a move, and it’s enough to suppress the three of you.”

“Ah?” Lin Yun was surprised as he looked at Dugu Jue.

At this moment, Ji Zixi and everyone else had come over, concerned about his injuries. Lin Jiangxian said, “He’s a little too shameless.”

“Well, there’s nothing wrong with his words. I was the one who said that our fight was a draw,” Lin Yun smiled.

Dugu Jue also heard the surrounding discussions, and smiled, “Feng Yuan, do you think I’m qualified now?”

He previously felt that he was humiliated by Lin Yun and was reduced to a sparring partner. But it was different now since it would only make him even more famous, fighting Lin Yun to a draw. In the future, he could boast that he once fought Lin Yun to a draw and held his ground with Lin Yun even after a few thousand moves.

The reason why he stood out now was to confirm it. As for the future, who would know what happened in the past?

Feng Yuan’s face became ashen, and he could no longer maintain his composure.

“Cut the crap and step down.” Profound Sky Venerable came forth with several people to take them away just when Feng Yuan wanted to speak.

“Flower Burial, we’ll meet again in a hundred years. I won’t forget this grudge!” Feng Yuan said, turning back to look at Lin Yun before Profound Sky Venerable took him away.

Lin Yun shook his head and said nothing. It was a pity that he couldn’t use his Sovereign Constellation and Nirvana Sword Art in this battle, which he could only use depending on the situation. He had barely stepped into Nirvana Dao, and could only use it once before the dao flower crumbled.

The Nirvana Sword Art was a set of sword techniques. His Sovereign Constellation could allow him to defeat his opponent quickly, but he would be in danger if he failed. The Nirvana Sword Art was a safer method, especially after achieving the Bright Sun Sword Intent.

He could quickly end the fight if he used either of them, and it was just a matter of his choice. But it was a pity he couldn’t use the Heaven Burial Constellation. He could now use it, but it was a pity that those three couldn’t force out this trump card of his.

“Big Brother Lin, what’s the matter?” Ji Zixi asked.

“I just found it a pity that I couldn’t use my two other trump cards,” Lin Yun smiled.

Does he still have trump cards? Everyone was shocked when they heard what Lin Yun said, since he didn’t lower his voice.

“You still have trump cards even after suppressing the three?” Feng Bumao was surprised.

Lin Yun smiled, “Well, not exactly. My saint energy is almost exhausted, and I even pushed myself over the limit. So I might not be able to unleash those trump cards, either.”

Feng Bumao’s lips twitched, knowing that what Lin Yun said was true. Everyone in the Heavenly Saint Courtyard was also left dumbfounded, but it was a problem that Lin Yun overconsumed his saint energy. Then again, he would meet the ancestral deity later, so it was just a matter of time for him to recover. But an uproar broke out when they heard Lin Yun say he still had two trump cards, which made everyone curious.

“Lin Yun, it looks like you will become a genius who suppresses an entire generation,” Luo Tianxi smiled on the throne.

“Perhaps,” Lin Yun smiled, raising his brow.

“Hahaha! You’re not humble at all. Alright, the four of you can come with me to meet my master.” Luo Tianxi waved his hand and brought Lin Yun, Ji Zixi, Yue Weiwei, and Dugu Jue to his side. He laughed, “I’m happy today. The banquet might’ve come to an end, but we will take out the wine that we’ve saved!”

“Come over immediately.” A voice resounded as if the ancestral deity couldn’t wait any longer. He reached out with his hand and grabbed a hold of the five people.

This made everyone stunned. They were shocked after realizing that it was the ancestral deity who made a move.

“Ancestral Stage...” Feng Qingyu sighed, watching the hand as it disappeared.

“When did you come?” Xiong Tiannan and Ao Jue were surprised because they hadn’t seen Feng Qingyu earlier.

Feng Qingyu smiled, “I have long arrived. Do you guys want to drink? There are many treasured wines in Heaven’s Gate, and I know a place. First come, first serve!”

He dragged Xiong Tiannan and Ao Jue to the wine cellar of Heaven’s Gate before they could even respond.

The five didn’t expect that the ancestral deity would personally bring them over. When the giant hand grabbed them, they lost control of their bodies as they passed through a weird door. They were before a grand palace when they landed on the ground.

Lin Yun looked around, and saw that there was nothing outside the palace but different colored lights. Each light represented a dao, and the lights were shuttling to a specific direction. Raising his head, Lin Yun saw a vortex of primal chaos at the very end. It didn’t seem far, but the lights looked as though they would never be able to reach that vortex of primal chaos.

“What is this place?” Everyone was shocked when they came to their senses.

Luo Tianxi’s face became weird, before he said, “This is Heaven’s Gate Ancestral Palace, where my master usually cultivates. This place is the Primal Chaos Secret Realm, but I don’t know much about it.”

There were many secrets here, and Luo Tianxi had only come here three times. Even Luo Tianxi didn’t know why the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity brought them here, but this meant they could see the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity in person.

While everyone was shocked, the palace’s gate opened up and a white-clothed youth came out. This youth had smooth skin and eyes shining like bright stars. Looking at him in the eyes would give everyone tremendous pressure, as though they were carrying a mountain on their backs.

While everyone was looking at this young man, the young man came over with a smile.

“Master,” Luo Tianxi bowed. The youth was the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity.

“Greetings, Ancestral Deity.” Lin Yun’s group also bowed. Since they hadn’t officially become the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity's disciples yet, they still couldn’t address him as their master.

The Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity smiled, before looking at Lin Yun, “The four of you stay here. I have something to tell Tianxi.”

Luo Tianxi’s face changed, before he quickly went to his knees. He could tell that the ancestral deity was furiously judging from how he gritted his teeth when he spoke.

The Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity coldly said, “Since when could the Dao Sect make a mess in the Heavenly Barren Banquet? If they made a move against geniuses from the Kunlun Realm, the banquet would be ruined.”

Luo Tianxi’s face became pale. He was prepared when he came here, but he was still terrified while facing his master.

Lin Yun and the others were shocked because they didn’t expect that the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity would reprimand the Heavenly Seal Emperor before them.

“Disciple is willing to receive my punishment.” Luo Tianxi lowered his head.

“I won’t punish you now. I want you to make the three holy lands’ sect masters come and apologize in half a year. Otherwise, I won’t let you go,” the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity said coldly.

“Thank you for sparing me, Master.” Luo Tianxi heaved in relief.

“Get lost.” The Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity said, waving his hand and sending Luo Tianxi out of the Primal Chaos Secret Realm.

The faces of the remaining four were uneasy, but they didn’t dare to speak. That was especially the case for Lin Yun, who suffered a tremendous blow from this scene. It turned out that not everyone was as forgiving to their disciples like the Radiant Sword Saint.

Speaking of which, if Lin Yun didn’t stand out today, the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity would have lost face. So Lin Yun could understand why Luo Tianxi would imprison those three in the Blood Purgatory Ruins, and realized that those three had gotten off easy.

After the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity was done reprimanding Luo Tianxi, he wore a smile while looking at the four. His gaze fell onto Lin Yun, and he smiled, “I have been waiting for you people, especially you, Flower Burial Lin Yun. Come in with me. As for the three of you, stay here and drink Demigod Wine while you wait.”

With a wave of his hand, a stone table appeared with a jar of wine and three cups. The wine was Demigod Wine.

Lin Yun’s heart became heated when he saw the jar of wine because he also wanted to drink it.

“Come on.” The Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity patted Lin Yun’s shoulder and walked in.

Before leaving, Lin Yun gave Yue Weiwei and Ji Zixi a nod then followed behind the Heavenly Barren Ancestral Deity.

But when Dugu Jue looked at Lin Yun’s figure, even the Demigod Wine had become tasteless to him. The Heaven’s Gate Ancestral Palace must be a great place, and even Luo Tianxi might be unable to enter it.
