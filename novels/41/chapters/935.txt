Chapter 936 - Leaving After He Was Done, Leaving No Trace Behind

There was nothing that couldn’t be resolved in the world with one sword. After all, there was always another sword. Evidently, Kong Xuan didn’t understand that.

According to Kong Xuan’s thinking, Lin Yun’s sword was terrifying and lethal. However, Lin Yun should have been exhausted after using the first one.

If it was the past Lin Yun, he wouldn’t be able to use the Azure Lotus after executing Lightning Cocoon. However, his strength had undergone a drastic transformation now that he was in the first soul Heavenly Soul Realm.

With his current sword, he even had leftover strength to execute a third sword.

An uproar took over Flamecloud City once Lin Yun sheathed his sword. No one could look at Lin Yun without shock in their eyes.

Kong Xuan was on the Azure Dragon Ranking and he was also in the third soul. It didn’t make sense to them that Lin Yun killed him so easily. It was especially strange because Kong Xuan was laughing at Lin Yun just a moment ago.

“Senior brother…” Yuan Hengtian and the elites of the Bloodbone Realm were completely dumbfounded. They couldn’t believe that the second strongest person from the Bloodbone Realm had died.

Their faces were filled with disbelief and their eyeballs nearly popped out of their sockets. However, nothing would change the outcome that they just witnessed. Starting from today, Kong Xuan was eliminated from the Heavenly Path.

Lin Yun suddenly turned towards the Bloodbone Realm’s party and all of them felt fear gripping their hearts. A chill ran down their spines as they began to tremble.

Yuan Hengtian was already injured, so he wasn’t as alert as normal. Before he could even respond, Lin Yun was standing in front of him with cold killing intent. Yuan Hengtian’s face became pale and his lips quivered before he gnashed his teeth, “Lin Yun, you already killed Senior Brother Kong. There’s no need for you to kill us too!”

“That’s right. Your battle with Senior Brother Kong has nothing to do with us!”

“Don’t take it too far!” All of the Bloodbone Realm’s elites spoke because they were utterly terrified by Lin Yun.

Take it too far? Lin Yun smiled because this was the biggest joke he had heard since arriving in the Heavenly Path. How was he the one who took it too far? The Bloodbone Realm was really shameless to distort the truth and slander him.

What about the people that Feng Wuji killed in Flamefeather City? What about the higher realm geniuses who arrogantly looked at everyone else like ants? Did any of them think of sparing people? Did they restrain themselves?

“Hahaha!” Lin Yun laughed before he barked, “I’m not a butcher. But if someone tries to take my life, I’ll take theirs instead! I had no grudge with the Bloodbone Realm, so why did your realm prevent me from competing for the treasures? Who the hell do you think you are?!”

“Who says that the Bloodbone Realm can treat everyone like ants? As a swordsman, I never back down from a fight. So I’m going to be killing all of you today. Don’t you dare think about running!” Everyone was startled by Lin Yun because his sword intent was too strong to resist.

“Split up!” Yuan Hengtian glared at Lin Yun before he continued, “Lin Yun, just you wait. My Bloodbone Realm will get revenge!”

After he was done speaking, the elites from the Bloodbone Realms ran in different directions.

“You guys think you guys can escape?” Lin Yun snorted with killing intent surging from the depths of his eyes. Drawing his sword once more, he executed Lightning Cocoon.

Seven sword silk threads chased after the seven elites of the Bloodbone Realm.

“Die!” When Lin Yun sheathed his sword, seven heads exploded. After all the heads exploded like fireworks, no one from the Bloodbone Realm was alive.

The uproar caused by Kong Xuan’s death suddenly died down with everyone widening their mouths in disbelief.

Outside Flamecloud City, on a barren mountain, stood a lady dressed in red and full of charm. The young lady was Yue Weiwei. She came to Flamecloud City because she was worried about Lin Yun’s safety. However, she didn’t approach and watched the battle from afar, just in case she didn’t need to reveal herself.

“It looks like I was worried for nothing. Big Brother Yun is still as handsome as before.” Yue Weiwei’s eyes dazzled for a bit before she turned around to leave. However, her eyes were filled with reluctance as soon as she turned around. She even glanced back at Lin Yun several times before she pulled herself away.

Lin Yun, meanwhile, had no idea that Yue Weiwei came to see him. Instead, he was relishing in the fact that he was victorious. He succeeded against an entire realm and killed all of the elites that tried to oppress him.

It was an outcome that no one had expected. Everyone just assumed that Lin Yun would be killed by the Bloodbone Realm. So all of the geniuses from the higher realms felt their pride getting crushed.

Lin Yun didn’t care about the pride of the higher realms. He would cut through anyone that stood in his way. Geniuses from the Blackflame Realm and Nethercloud Realm were in attendance because they wanted to take back their dao artifacts. But when they saw that Lin Yun didn’t care about the higher realms, they weren’t sure what to do.

Initially, they thought that Lin Yun would fall to the Bloodbone Realm. It would present the perfect opportunity for them to show up, humiliate Lin Yun, and seize the dao artifacts. However, since Lin Yun killed everyone from the Bloodbone Realm, no one had the courage to fight.

While the Blackflame Realm and Nethercloud Realm debated their next move, Lil’ Red ran around gathering all the interspatial pouches from the corpses. After it was done, it returned to Lin Yun’s shoulder and started chuckling.

“It’s time to go!” Lin Yun swept his gaze through the crowd before he left. He was making sure that he left no traces of the Bloodbone Realm behind.

After Lin Yun left, everyone started to ponder the grace of his sword. Lin Yun’s sword was so beautiful that it was deeply imprinted in everyone’s mind. Although he was arrogant, he was still a graceful swordsman. He even declared that he would compete against the higher realms.

Lin Yun was correct. The treasures and opportunities in the Heavenly Path were open to everyone. So if an ant wanted to do as they pleased, they were allowed to.

After today, Lin Yun’s name was destined to shake the Azure Dragon Region. This time, the rumors would be forged by Kong Xuan’s corpse. In fact, the entire Bloodbone Realm had become Lin Yun’s stepping stone. In a single day, Lin Yun went from someone who had to observe the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm to someone who would raid the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm.𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

After half a day of traveling, Lin Yun came to a stop at a barren mountain. Then, Lil’ Red started looking around from on his shoulder.

“Friend, are you going to keep hiding? You’ve been following me ever since Flamefeather City.” Lin Yun said.

“Hehe. Flower Burial, you really are impressive. But are you really sure you want me to show myself? Every single man who looks at me either loses their soul or their life. Which one do you think you’ll lose?” A playful feminine voice sounded out on the barren land. Her voice was filled with charm that would force someone to lower their defenses.

Lin Yun’s heart sank when he heard the voice. He had a feeling that someone was following him, but he wasn’t too sure. It turned out that his instincts were correct. Is it someone from the Bloodbone Realm?

Lin Yun quickly shook that thought from his mind. He was certain that the person following him was a lot stronger than Kong Xuan. If she wanted to make a move, she could have done so when he was fighting with Kong Xuan. Hmmm, what’s her goal? Then, Lin Yun thought about the Glorysun Spirit.
