Chapter 2199: Red-Clothed Youth

That was an overbearing sword that made everyone take a cold breath. After all, the Tough Peak Saint Sovereign was someone on the same level as Great Saints, but he was pinned a hundred miles away, instantly leaving everyone from the Bai Clan and Zhang Clan dumbfounded.

Most importantly, there were four Saint Sovereigns kneeling on the ground, and they couldn’t get back up due to the injuries inflicted by Ye Guhan. A Saint Sovereign couldn’t be humiliated? This was no different from the ultimate humiliation!

The Stun Yang Saint Sovereign, who claimed that he wanted to dig out Ye Guhan’s saint origin, was frightened with his face becoming pale. This was too terrifying because one wouldn’t feel the oppression that Ye Guhan was giving if they weren’t facing him. How is this someone who has just become a Great Saint? He doesn’t look like it at all!

“Uncle, do you still want to dig out my saint origin?” Ye Guhan looked at the Stun Yang Saint Sovereign with a playful gaze.

The Stun Yang Saint Sovereign was furious, and he cursed, “Ye Guhan, do you really want to become the sinner of the Ye Clan? Since when has the Ye Clan let you down? Yet, you even touched the ancestor?”

Ye Guhan burst into laughter, “When has the Ye Clan let me down? I’ll not speak of the past. But in recent years, your branch has been suppressing the other branches, and I couldn’t be bothered about it. But what you guys did tonight was too much…” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

He ignored the five Saint Sovereigns. He turned to look at the Saints and Quasi-Saints from the Ye Clan who could still move, and said, “It’s not too late for you guys to turn back around now. Otherwise, none of you will be able to escape after this ends!”

He had held back and hadn’t killed anyone from the Ye Clan until now. Many of the Ye Clan’s Saints were embarrassed, and they didn’t dare to speak. Instead, they all turned to look at the Stun Yang Saint Sovereign.

“It looks like the lesson wasn’t harsh enough,” Ye Guhan sighed as he swung his sword, unleashing a vertical sword ray that split Mister Ghost into two before he could even respond, and his blood splashed on the faces of the Ye Clan’s saints.

Mister Ghost’s saint origin exploded like a firefly, and his Saint Soul was mercilessly struck by Ye Guhan when it flew out. This made Mister Ghost scream out in pain as he twisted around in the air. His dao flowers began to wither before slowly disappearing in heaven and earth.

After becoming a Saint Sovereign, even if one didn’t cultivate the physique, their physique would still be comparable to Saint Artifacts. But if they focused on practicing their physique and engrave saint runes on it, they would have an extremely powerful physique. Even so, Mister Ghost's severed body was slowly being corroded by sword intent that made everyone’s soul tremble. This was simply too terrifying.

It was hard for one to die after becoming a Saint Sovereign, even if they were heavily injured. This was because Saint Sovereigns were different from mortals, and they had a powerful life force. Their Saint Soul, Saint Constellation, and Saint Origin would have fused with their bodies, and you would have to destroy all three if you wanted to kill a Saint Sovereign.

Otherwise, it was impossible for one to truly kill a Saint Sovereign if one was still around. This was the reason why Stun Yang Saint Sovereign was still being stubborn, despite kneeling on the ground. He was a Saint Sovereign for a few hundred years, and he wouldn’t die anytime soon, even if he suffered such humiliation.

Even a Great Saint would have some trouble killing a Saint Sovereign unless they wanted to die. The best way was to seal their cultivation and slowly torture them through time to exhaust them to death.

But who could’ve thought that a Saint Sovereign would be killed by a sword? This was the grace of the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple, cutting through everything with one sword.

“Let’s go!”

“We’ll leave immediately!” The remaining Saints from the Ye Clan were terrified and dumbfounded, no longer daring to stay here for another moment. No matter what the Stun Yang Saint Sovereign said, they all wanted to flee this place with horror on their faces.

“Cripple your cultivation,” Ye Guhan said without any emotions as he looked at the four Saint Sovereigns.

The Stun Yang Saint Sovereign wore a bitter expression because if he crippled his cultivation that was nearly a thousand years, he would be worse off than being dead. But if he didn’t do it, Mister Ghost would become their outcome, and Ye Guhan definitely had the strength to kill him.

As a result, their bodies began to tremble. Not long ago, they even nearly forced the Heavenly Floral Saint Sovereign to cripple his cultivation, but who would have thought that it would be their turn so soon?

“The massive Ye Clan being forced to this far by a junior. What a joke.” Right then, a red-clothed youth came out from the back of the Ye Clan. This person looked to be around fourteen, but his eyes were filled with vicissitude.

The four Saint Sovereigns who were hesitating if they should cripple themselves rejoiced when they heard this voice. The Stun Yang Saint Sovereign came to his senses, and immediately figured out that this should be the ‘reinforcement’ spoken of by the Wang Clan. He said, “Senior, please save us. The Nether Orchid Courtyard is destroyed.”

But the red-clothed youth paid no attention to him as he looked at Ye Guhan with a smile on his face. The sudden appearance of this red-clothed youth made everyone from the Bai Clan and Zhang Clan nervous because he appeared out of nowhere, and no one paid any attention to him.

They only discovered him after he spoke out, and yet everyone here were saints. It was terrifying that he could get so close without anyone detecting him. Most importantly, his eyes were filled with vicissitude despite his tender and youthful appearance.

This conflict created a bizarre situation that made everyone’s hearts tremble.

Ye Guhan frowned because he also didn’t notice this red-clothed youth before he showed himself. But he recognized the clothes that this youth was wearing. There were crimson moon patterns on it, signifying that he was from the Blood Moon Sect. He asked, “You’re an expert from the demonic cult?”

“The demonic cult?” The red-clothed youth smiled. “We’re only cultivators who worship the sacred flame, and we became a demonic cult in your eyes? Back then, the Blue Dragon Ancestral God was tolerant and accepted the existence of our sect. It’s no wonder why the Kunlun Realm has declined. This is because the Divine Dragon Era lost their magnanimity. Since you say that we’re from the demonic cult, I guess I should do something someone of the demonic cult should do. Ye Guhan, you’re too kind. You shouldn’t be merciful when dealing with your opponents. Even if they crippled their cultivation, they would still have the chance to restore it, so you should eradicate the roots. Let me help you, if you can’t do it.”

The red-clothed youth suddenly appeared before the Stun Yang Saint Sovereign with his hand on the latter’s head, grabbing it. This speed was so fast that even space was torn apart by him. His palm formed into a claw with a spatial vortex forming that looked like a red spring.

Ye Guhan made a move and swung his sword to pierce through the red vortex, but the red-clothed youth smiled as though he was prepared for it, and his other hand struck Ye Guhan’s chest at lightning speed.

When his palm clashed against Ye Guhan’s sword, they both took a few steps back as Ye Guhan waved his hand, and the four kneeling on the ground felt relieved because they were sent flying away from the battleground.

While Ye Guhan was anxious about saving them earlier, he suffered a loss in the clash and let out a groan. He might’ve pulled his sword back to defend against that palm, but the power from the palm still traveled through the sword, making Ye Guhan feel terrible.

“The Radiant Sword Saint is too benevolent. That is why Tian Xuanzi was allowed to grow into his current height. You don’t have much capability, but you have inherited your master’s benevolence, and this won’t do…” The red-clothed youth smiled. He looked like a young man, but he looked overbearing as he dashed forth, clashing with Ye Guhan.

The seven swords rotated around Ye Guhan as the Great Profound Sword Array kept changing, but the red-clothed youth would always have a way to break it. The red-clothed youth was calm as he faced the attributes from the seven swords.

With a loud explosion, the Indigo Firmament Sword was sent flying away. When the Golden Firmament Sword came at him, he used his fingers as a sword to smash it apart. As for the Scarlet Firmament Sword , he unleashed flames that could even extinguish the flames from the Scarlet Firmament Sword.

They both exchanged ten-odd moves in the blink of an eye, and the red-clothed youth was calm and composed as he weaved through the Great Profound Sword Array.

Myriad Swords Unite!

When the seven peaks combined together, the red-clothed youth looked a little serious as he raised his right hand to the sky. A crimson moon appeared from his palm that looked like a planet with craters on the surface, filled with vicissitudes.

Ye Guhan’s attack should be terrifying, but space shattered as the crimson moon revolved, and the sword ray was blocked just like that. When the red-clothed youth gently pushed his palm forth, the crimson moon began to grow in size. Not only did it manage to shatter the sword ray, but it also left cracks on Ye Guhan’s sword aura.

The red-clothed youth hovered in the air, and he looked all-mighty like an emperor. With just a glance, those from the Zhang and Bai Clans were sent flying away, throwing mouthfuls of blood as they suffered heavy injuries to their souls.

“Emperor aura!” Ye Guhan wiped the blood off his lips with shock reflected in his eyes.

The Zhang Clan’s ancestor said in a trembling tone, “I know who he is!”

On the mountain to the Celestial Pool, Zhao Tianyu, Wang Muyan, and Gu Xinyu walked slowly, before they stopped upon seeing a crimson moon rise to the sky. This made Gu Xinyu excited as he exclaimed, “The sect master’s clone has finally arrived!”
