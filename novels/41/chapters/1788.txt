Chapter 1789 - Anyone Else?

“A Glory Saint Artifact? The Nethermoon Saint Armor?” Yi Feng and the others immediately turned to look at the armor Ao Feng was wearing. It was a close-fitting battle armor burning with blood flames, with brilliant saint runes engraved on it that divided the armor into small grids.

In the nodes where the saint runes were connected together, there was a blood moon engraved, and there was a figure within each blood moon. Every figure was forming a different seal, and the blood moon seemed like actual stars shining brightly.

Glory Saint Artifacts were so rare that not every saint possessed them. The Nethermoon Saint Armor was a treasure of the Blood Moon Sect. It was rumored that in the dark era, the three thousand guardians of the Blood Moon Sect fought wearing saint armor.

When each guardian died, their saint origin would merge with the saint armor and be engraved on each node on the armor. Thus, the Nethermoon Saint Armor that remained till now was strong, and each armor received the blessing of at least hundreds of saints.

If the full power could be brought out, it could easily smash a star apart, unleashing unimaginable power. Then again, even a saint would have difficulty unleashing the full power of the Nethermoon Saint Armor.

The current Ao Feng didn’t even bring out one-thousandth of the Nethermoon Saint Armor. But even so, he was practically invincible as long as he had the armor on. At the very least, he was nearly invincible in the Dragon Pulse Realm.

“The Blood Moon Sect is really bold to take out the Nethermoon Saint Armor for the first rank on the Dragon Pulse Ranking. You’re not afraid that you won’t be able to return?”

Shaking his head, Lin Qingyang said, “The Nethermoon Saint Armor is no different from nurturing poisonous insects. As long as the Blood Moon Sect still has a Nethermoon Saint Armor, even if everyone else with one dies, it would make the remaining Nethermoon Saint Armor even more powerful! Not to mention they definitely didn’t come here alone, so it’s hard to make them stay.”

Everyone furrowed their brows, and their faces were ugly. They didn’t have a Glory Saint Artifact with them because they were too precious. If they lost it, the sect would suffer an immeasurable loss. This meant that they had no advantage against Ao Feng and Yan Cangming.

Even if they were stronger in martial dao, they wouldn’t have any odds of winning, so this was too unfair.

“These two probably came prepared, so we shouldn’t have let them participate in the Martial Dao Tea Party, to begin with.” Ji Lignfeng said in a deep voice. If he had a Glory Saint Artifact, he was confident that he could sweep through everyone here with his phoenix inheritance.

But facing Ao Feng and the Nethermoon Saint Armor, this was no longer something he could win against with cultivation alone. Most importantly, there weren’t any restrictions on Glory Saint Artifacts in the Martial Dao Tea Party.

Firstly, everyone knew it would be shameless to use a Glory Saint Artifact and be ridiculed by everyone else. But these two from the Blood Moon Sect didn’t care about that at all. Secondly, Glory Saint Artifacts were extremely rare, and it wasn’t something that they could unleash the full power of while at the Dragon Pulse Realm. Not to mention it would also make them a target for everyone. If the news leaked out, even saints might come after them.

On the Thunderblood Battlestage, Ao Feng swiftly destroyed all the incoming sword rays. When Yan Tie swung his sword to unleash thirty-six sword rays, a tattered moon rose to the sky. He made a breakthrough on the spot, and this made his Death Dance even more powerful.

But his attacks were nothing to Ao Feng. The moment he executed thirty-six sword rays, they were instantly resolved, and this made Yan Tie spit out blood while being sent flying from the stage.

Fortunately, he was caught by Lin Yun, who helped to resolve the baleful aura within his body with the Blue Dragon Bone. Otherwise, Yan Tie would be heavily injured by this attack, and he wouldn’t be able to recover for at least a few months.Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“How pitiful.” Ao Feng snickered with his hands behind him.

“Let me, Yu Wenxiu, face you, then!” The Ming Cult’s Yu Wenxiu soared to the sky and dashed forth, wanting to catch Ao Feng by surprise. Ao Feng had just finished his battle, and he wanted to take this advantage to catch the former by surprise.

It wasn’t graceful, to be honest, but no one cared about that. If he could succeed, it would greatly boost everyone’s morale in the Eastern Desolation. After exchanging ten-odd attacks, the sun and moon diagram behind Yu Wenxiu was destroyed.

This made Yu Wenxiu throw out a mouthful of blood before he was sent flying away. But Yu Wenxiu was a genius of the Ming Cult. After he was defeated, he quickly returned to his pavilion with blood dripping down from his lips and face pale. He knew that if he continued to fight, he might end up heavily injured.

“Haha. Not only did the Ming Cult’s representative resort to sneak attacks, but you’re even faster at running away!” Ao Feng snickered with mockery filling his pupils.

On the other battleground, Yan Cangming also brought out the Nethermoon Saint Armor and knocked Yi Feng out with three palms. The Myriad Lightning Sect’s disciples quickly stepped forth to bring the fainted Yi Feng down.

This made the hearts of everyone around the Thunderblood Battlestage sink. If Yan Cangming hadn’t shown mercy, Yi Feng would’ve lost his life a long time ago, and no one could accept this result. Not only were Yi Feng and Yan Tie undefeated, but even Yu Wenxiu could only flee after launching a sneak attack. They had thoroughly embarrassed themselves this time.

“Is the Martial Dao Tea Party really going to end up as a joke?” Everyone reluctantly sighed.

Just a moment ago, everyone was in high spirits while discussing who would be first on the Dragon Pulse Ranking. But the appearance of two god generals from the Blood Moon Sect disrupted everyone and even trampled on the pride of everyone from the Eastern Desolation. If what happened today was spread out, it would make everyone from the Eastern Desolation’s Dragon Pulse Ranking a laughing stock.

This made the Autumn Mountain Lord’s face change as he clenched his fist together with regret. He did expect that they came prepared, but he never expected they would come with two Glory Saint Artifacts.

The entire Thunderblood Square fell into silence. They were looking forward to seeing the Autumn Mountain Lord, Ji Lingfeng, and Xiao Yuanqi stand out. But the three forged their fame a long time ago, and they knew how terrifying the Nethermoon Saint Armors were. If they lost, they would be heavily humiliated by those two. So this naturally made them feel uncertain.

Seeing this, Ao Feng smiled, “It looks like there’s nothing impressive about the Eastern Desolation’s Dragon Pulse Ranking after all. We still haven’t had our fun yet, and yet no one dares to challenge us?”

Yan Cangming looked at the Autumn Mountain Lord, and smiled, “Since that’s the case, we’ll be taking our farewell, then. Remember to write our names on the Dragon Pulse Ranking. Hahaha!”

This made the Four Young Masters’ faces become ugly because the Martial Dao Tea Party was ruined. Not only were they humiliated, but the Divine Dragon Empire’s prestige also took a huge blow. Because of this matter, the Divine Dragon Empire would surely punish them. After all, their Dragon Clan’s martial techniques weren’t for free, and their faces became even more ugly while thinking about the consequences they had to face.

Right then, the Wind Edge Lord smiled, “Who says that there’s no one in my Eastern Desolation who can challenge you? Lin Xiao is the strongest swordsman, and he even grasped the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent. His strength is deep and unfathomable, not to mention he’s also proficient in music dao. He’s just in disdain to fight you two!”

“Heavenly Dome Sword Intent?” Ao Feng and Yan Cangming instantly became interested.

“Don’t listen to his rubbish. Lin Xiao only grasped the Quasi-Heavenly Dome Sword Intent.” Ji Lingfeng furrowed his brows. He could tell the Wind Edge Lord was trying to drag Lin Yun down.

But Ao Feng didn’t care about him and sneered, “Where’s the champion of the Nirvana Banquet? Since you grasped the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent, why don’t you dare to fight?”

Immediately, everyone’s gazes fell onto the pavilion that Lin Yun was in.

“You’re the champion of the Nirvana Banquet?” Ao Feng wore a cruel smile, and he continued, “It doesn’t matter if you’ve grasped the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent. Just by being the strongest swordsman on the Dragon Pulse Ranking alone, you’ll have to kneel and beg for mercy!”

Ao Feng circulated his vitality and the Nethermoon Saint Armor as dragon origin began to start boiling. With a flash, he dashed towards Lin Yun.

This scene made everyone inwardly sigh and felt that Lin Yun was doomed. The Wind Edge Lord was clearly targeting Lin Yun by saying that he was the strongest swordsman on the Dragon Pulse Ranking. After all, it appeared that Ao Feng and Yan Cangming were determined to defeat any ‘firsts’ and make the entire Eastern Desolation look like a laughingstock.

If Ji Lingfeng, Xiao Yuanqi, and the Autumn Mountain Lord did nothing, Lin Yun would definitely lose terribly, and he might even die if he wasn’t careful. But did the three even have the courage to stand out? They would’ve made a move a long time ago if they were confident, and there was no position for Ao Feng and Yan Cangming to be arrogant.

Many people inwardly shook their heads because the Martial Dao Tea Party now seemed pathetic and ridiculous. If Jian Jingtian was still around, would these two dare to be so arrogant? Jian Jingtian would probably cut them down with one sword.

As a loud explosion occurred, the entire pavilion was blown into smithereens. The heaven and earth trembled, and everyone was dumbfounded because they could tell from the sound it appeared to be an evenly matched clash.

Everyone immediately opened their eyes and looked over, wanting to see what happened.
