Chapter 1573 - Undefeated Blue Dragon

Along with Lin Yun’s appearance, the surroundings fell into a brief silence. Even the two other Dragon Pulse Realm geniuses from the Profound Sky Sect who were ganging up on Ye Ziling and the others turned their gazes over.

As for the other sects’ disciples' gazes, they were also on Lin Yun. The Divine Dragon Artifacts' appearance made everyone briefly forget about him. But when he reappeared, only then did everyone realize that Lin Yun was still in the Dragon Transforming Pool.

Everyone felt that he was a little too bold with his words. Luo Yuan had reached the third-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. In addition to his fifth-grade flame intent and Profound Sky Canon, the experts from the other sects have all lost to him. It was so much so that Mu Xueqin, Luo Xi, and Zhang Xuan, whom were considered the strongest amongst the seven sects, all lost to him.

As Lin Yun gently tapped his foot in mid-air, he appeared beside Mu Xueqin and helped her up.

“Junior Brother, there’s no need for you to fight him when you’ve just reached the Dragon Pulse Realm.” Mu Xueqin’s eyes flashed with concern. She was afraid that Lin Yun would put himself in danger because of his words.

“The Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple is extraordinary, with the guts to challenge me when you’ve just reached the Dragon Pulse Realm.” Luo Yuan snickered. He was happy because this gave him the excuse to get rid of Lin Yun since he came up on his own accord.

“Luo Yuan, what are you talking about?” Mu Xueqin roared with her face changed.

“Hahaha! Didn’t you hear me? Since the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple has challenged me, I’ll fulfill his wish, then!” Luo Yuan snickered.

“He’s just being impulsive!” Mu Xueqin said with her face ugly.

“Let’s put this to an end. Luo Yuan, the saint sword believes you, and I believe there isn’t anyone unconvinced.” The Heavenly Pool Saint Lord spoke out. He couldn’t bear the responsibility of the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple being crippled by the Profound Sky Sect. At the very least, this couldn’t happen within the manor.

Lin Yun still wanted to say something, but Mu Xueqin stopped him, “The Saint Lord is right.”

“Ha!” Luo Yuan smiled. “Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple, do your words still count?”

The Heavenly Pool Saint Lord’s face changed because Luo Yuan was equivalent to disregarding him.

“You want me to stop? Sure! Apologize to me as the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple and admit that you’re weak before begging me for forgiveness.” Luo Yuan said, and his words made everyone’s faces change because he was practically forcing Lin Yun to fight him.

“There’s no need to be so troublesome. You’ll know if I’m weak with a fight, and I have an objection to you getting the saint sword. So you don’t have to try and find ways to force me.” Lin Yun smiled. He had been waiting for this moment after staying in the Dragon Transforming Pool for so long. He had been unhappy with Luo Yuan for so long, but he couldn’t do anything back when he was still in the Elysium Core Realm.

As a swordsman, he pursued resolving grudges immediately and not keeping them until the next day. This had nothing to do with his identity as the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple. He had no intention of swallowing this matter down, to begin with.

“Junior Brother, he a genius of the Golden Generation!” Mu Xueqin anxiously said.Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Haha! It’s too late to regret it now. Profound Sky Sect’s Luo Yuan accepts the Radiant Sword Saint’s challenge!” Luo Yuan laughed before pushing his palm forth at Lin Yun. As flames blazed, the gigantic flaming palm flew forth.

In response, Lin Yun joined his hands together and pushed the heavily injured Mu Xueqin away before opening his palms. Circulating the Azure Dragon Saint Art, he pushed one of his palms forth, executing the Azure Dragon Grasp!

The two palms collided over the Dragon Transforming Pool and boundless dragon origin exploded from them. Their dragon origins manifested into streaks of light that were colliding back and forth. The two palms were stuck together in the sky, blooming into various phenomena. One side was a sea of flames, and the other side was a violent thunderstorm filled with a boundless dragon aura.

Lin Yun stood on the spot with his azure clothes fluttering within the violent gale. He stood in the air like a divine sword, and he was multitasking at this moment with seas of flowers appearing behind him. When he swiped his finger, a sword ray manifested into a river and attacked Luo Yuan.

“This fellow has gotten stronger after reaching the Dragon Pulse Realm!” Luo Yuan knew that Lin Yun’s attainment in the sword was strong, but he didn’t expect the power to become stronger after reaching the Dragon Pulse Realm with no changes in his sword intent.

“Break!” Luo Yuan stepped forth and waved his hand. A nine-section whip engraved with ancient saint runes and covered with golden flames flew towards that sword ray. Each section on the whip was created by fusing agrium and dragon bone, with more than two thousand saint runes engraved on it.

The sword ray was destroyed with a whip from Luo Yuan, but Lin Yun waved his hand and unleashed another sword aura, aiming for Luo Yuan’s neck when the latter resolved his last sword ray. This surprised Luo Yuan, forcing him to control the nine-section whip to knock the sword ray away.

“Divine Azure Annihilation!” Lin Yun’s sword ocean shone brightly before an azure dragon flew out from his brows. The golden azure dragon then entered the Flower Burial Sword and the sword tried to pierce Luo Yuan’s chest. The Flower Burial Sword easily tore apart the dragon origin protecting Luo Yuan.

Luo Yuan was forced to take several steps back and poured his dragon origin into the nine-section whip, and the whip was like a longsword as it collided with the Flower Burial Sword. But a sword aura far exceeding the Firmament Sword Intent exploded from the Flower Burial Sword, transmitting through the whip to Luo Yuan from his hand to his feet.

Under that terrifying sword aura, the protective layers that the Heavenly Pool Manor had set on the ground began to crack with fragments flying out. When Luo Yuan blocked Lin Yun’s sword, it felt like a giant was swinging his sword down at him from the sky.

Lin Yun was clearly a few hundred meters away, but he had fused with his sword, and he was the heaven. As a terrifying sword aura exploded out from him, Lin Yun swung his sword thirty-six times, all aimed at Luo Yuan’s fatal spots.

“How is this possible?” Luo Yuan’s face changed as he quickly manipulated his vitality. His physique suddenly became comparable to a beast, and the nine-section whip was the beast's claw. As a gale enveloped his feet, he swiftly retreated and avoided most of the sword rays.

With a flick of his right wrist, the nine-section whip glowed and blocked nine sword rays. But a sword ray still tore apart the dragon origin protecting his body and left a two-inch wound on his shoulder.

Luo Yuan retreated a few hundred meters away, but the flaming palm was torn apart by the dragon claw. When the dragon claw descended, he was forced to retreat again but was caught up in the shockwave. When he landed on the ground, he looked at Lin Yun with shock, “One with the sword? You’ve achieved the fifth-grade sword intent?!”

Reaching out with his hand, Lin Yun grabbed onto the Flower Burial Sword that flew back with pity on his face. He didn’t answer Luo Yuan’s question. His sword intent was still at the quasi-Heavenly Dome Sword Intent. But after reaching the Dragon Pulse Realm, he had a deeper understanding of the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent, and he was only one step away.

He had pushed his quasi-Heavenly Dome Sword Intent to the limit in that sword. That was enough to tear anyone apart, but it was a pity that Luo Yuan was a little too strong.

The clash between the two had left everyone shocked. When they came to their senses, their jaws nearly fell off because they didn’t expect Lin Yun to be so powerful. Everyone had witnessed how strong Luo Yuan was, and even the seven leaders of the seven sects weren’t his opponent; they didn’t even force him to use his nine-section whip.

But they never expected that not only was Lin Yun capable of forcing Luo Yuan to retreat from a frontal confrontation, he even injured his shoulder. They initially thought Lin Yun wouldn’t be able to hold a cradle to Luo Yuan. But they never expected Lin Yun would be so strong after reaching the Dragon Pulse Realm.

“Incredible…” exclaimed Yan Gu of the Heavenly Blade Pavilion. He was the first to be heavily injured by Luo Yuan.

“Lin Yun is actually so strong? How much dragon origin did he convert? It’s no wonder why he’s so confident.” Mu Xueqin had shock in her eyes.

“As a disciple of the Radiant Sword Saint, he was already invincible in the way of the sword. But this isn’t all of Luo Yuan’s strength, and his nine-section whip is terrifying. Combined with his flame intent, he doesn’t have any weakness.” The Heavenly Pool Saint Lord said.

Luo Yuan kept his disdain and looked at Lin Yun, “The Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple is truly impressive to be so strong when you’ve just reached the Dragon Pulse Realm. It looks like I’ve underestimated you.”

“You’re not bad yourself. But I bet you still have a long way to go to be compared to those in the Golden Generation, right? Strongest beneath the Golden Generation, it’s pretty suitable with you.” Lin Yun replied.

His words made Luo Yuan furious because that title wasn’t glory but humiliation. He roared, “You must be courting death! Liu Yu and Bai Kuang, what are you guys doing? Snatch the Saint Dragon War Flag!”

His words changed the two Dragon Pulse Realm geniuses’ faces and they attacked again. They were both at the second-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm and practically had no opponents. When they joined forces, they could easily suppress the four Sword Sect’s saint disciples and two Heaven Ranking genius. Mu Xueqin was heavily injured, so she couldn’t help in their fight. This instantly placed Ye Ziling and others under tremendous pressure.

“Trying to distract me?” Lin Yun’s face became cold.

“You’re overthinking it. Today, every single Sword Sect disciple will go down on their knees!” Luo Yuan poured his flaming dragon origin into the nine-section whip, and the saint runes on each section lit up brightly. When he swung his whip out thrice, the saint runes engraved on the sections flew out and converged into a golden divine dragon.

“I forgot to tell you that this whip is a replica of the Divine Dragon Empire’s Dragon Whip. It’s the bane of the dragon clan meant to deal with traitors. I believe you’ve cultivated a dragon clan’s body-refining technique, right? Let’s see how many whips you can take from me, then!” Luo Yuan snorted.

The divine dragon put Lin Yun under immense pressure, and the circulation of his dragon runes was greatly affected. Facing Luo Yuan’s attacks, Lin Yun could only use the Divine Sunchasing Art. A pair of Golden Crow Wings suddenly appeared behind him while he swung his sword to block those attacks. As the sword rays flashed even faster, the Blue Dragon Bone within Lin Yun’s chest emitted a dazzling blue radiance.

“It looks like I’m right. There’s no way the Golden Dragon can suppress the Blue Dragon.”
