Chapter 1190 - Fight Zhao Yan (2)

“Sword Like A Dragon!” A dragon roar echoed out of Zhao Yan’s body as the lightning serpent-dragon transformed into a genuine dragon. Then, the dragon charged towards the Azure Birds enveloping Lin Yun.

As the entire sky turned dark, the lightning covered Zhao Yan charged forward to destroy all of the Azure Birds that Lin Yun had created with one sword.

Lin Yun’s expression became serious. He didn’t dare to go easy right now. So he manifested a massive ocean of clouds while the Azure Birds turned into gigantic mountains surrounded by the clouds. He successfully unleashed an enormous sword aura.

“Emerald Stars!” Lin Yun took a deep breath with a light flashing through his pupils. As he soared into the sky, he faced Zhao Yan’s attack head-on. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

When Lin Yun soared into the sky, it felt as though a gigantic mountain had flown over, causing the ominous beasts’ statues to start trembling. At the same time, the immense pressure from the sword aura had created a powerful storm in the surroundings.

Executing Emerald Stars, Lin Yun added one more Azure Bird to his attack. With 11 Azure Birds flying through the sky, the boundless starry sky above Lin Yun cracked. Then, a figure that looked like a deity descended from the nine heavens with his sword.

When that figure overlapped with Lin Yun, a dazzling sword ray broke out and collided with Zhao Yan’s attack. Just like that, the two swords violently clashed together and created various phenomena behind Lin Yun and Zhao Yan.

Behind Zhao Yan was a coiled up lightning dragon roaring ferociously that caused the sky to turn dark while thunderclouds tumbled in the darkness. Meanwhile, 11 Azure Birds flew in a loop behind Lin Yun. As they flew, the sword ray emitted from Lin Yun’s sword continued to increase.

All of this had taken place in a split second. When a resounding sword hum echoed out in heaven and earth, Lin Yun and Zhao Yan looked at each other with a great desire to win.

When both their sword auras reached the limit, the phenomena, sword intent, and energies that were tangled up exploded. Immediately, Lin Yun and Zhao Yan were sent flying. The explosions created multiple water geysers on the lake that looked like gigantic blades.

“Flower Burial!” Lin Yun didn’t panic from the aftermath. He retreated and gathered all of the scattered sword aura back to his sword. However, the sword ray was dimmer than before.

At this moment, Lin Yun was one with his sword. He had gathered all his energy and aura onto his sword. When he swung his sword out, the Flower Burial Sword flew like a streak of light that charged towards Zhao Yan.

This made Zhao Yan squint because he never expected that Lin Yun would still have the ability to control his sword after their clash. After all, their energies had become chaotic during their clash and the phenomena had sent them flying.

Unlike Zhao Yan, Lin Yun took a risky approach and allowed the violent energy to rumble inside his body. He was more focused on throwing his sword at Zhao Yan.

Lowering his center of gravity, Zhao Yan forcibly stabilized himself in mid-air. When he landed on the ground, he roared, “Lightning Shadow!”

Activating countless saint runes in his sword, Zhao Yan swung his sword out just when Lin Yun’s sword was about to reach him. The clash injured him and made him throw up blood. However, Lin Yun’s sword was sent flying back like a comet.

Clearly, there was a huge difference between a swordsman with a sword and a swordsman without a sword. When the Flower Burial Sword fell onto the plaza, the sword ray that burst out from it sent several people in the surroundings flying out.

“Where is he?” But just when Zhao Yan wanted to lock onto Lin Yun, he was shocked to discover that Lin Yun had disappeared. But right at this moment, a cold intent emitted out from his back. Zhao Yan instantly turned around as if he had a pair of eyes behind him and turned while swinging his sword.

“You’re too slow!” Lin Yun’s voice sounded out beside Zhao Yan’s ears. Before Zhao Yan could even react in time, Lin Yun began to throw punches at Zhao Yan.

This time, he was using his fists like swords, merging his sword and punches together. Just like that, Lin Yun had thrown out hundreds of punches in the blink of an eye that destroyed the astral energy around Zhao Yan. Once again, Zhao Yan threw up blood and was sent flying.

When Zhao Yan fell onto the ground, Lin Yun had disappeared.

“The same trick won’t work on me twice!” This time, Zhao Yan didn’t even hesitate to turn around and slash out with his sword. Regardless of how many punches he had taken from Lin Yun, he only needed one sword to win. He just needed to heavily injure Lin Yun.

But just when Zhao Yan turned halfway back, he instantly discovered that the Lin Yun in front of him was only an afterimage. Without any hesitation, he turned back to his original position and swung his sword.

His sword tore another afterimage into pieces, and his sword ray exploded on the lake. In the end, his sword ray collided with the gigantic sword on the cauldron.

The collision sounded like an ancient bell ringing that echoed out. Discovering that he was tricked, the corner of Zhao Yan’s lips twitched before he immediately turned around.

“Sword!” This time, the Lin Yun standing in front of him was the real person. But just when he wanted to swing his sword out, Lin Yun had already summoned his sword back into his hand.

When he turned around, Lin Yun was already stabbed him with a sword. However, the sword stopped right before it was about to pierce Zhao Yan’s forehead.

A trace of blood dripped down from Zhao Yan’s forehead from the halted attack. As blood flowed down Zhao Yan’s nose, Zhao Yan didn’t even dare to breathe. He only needed one sword to defeat Lin Yun, but he wasn’t successful no matter how he tried. At this moment, he didn’t even dare to move.

“I lost.” Zhao Yan let out a long sigh because he knew that Lin Yun had gone easy on him. Otherwise, Lin Yun’s sword would have claimed his life.

But Lin Yun didn’t seem to show any intentions of ending it here, which raised alarm in Zhao Yan’s heart. After all, Lin Yun already blinded Chen Ying and cut Yan Zijing’s throat.

At this moment, even someone like Zhao Yan who was ranked in the top thousand couldn’t help but tremble in fear, “B-Brother Lin. The Sword Assembly forbids killing.”

“Praise it. I can’t control it,” smiled Lin Yun bitterly.

Zhao Yan was briefly stunned before he understood what Lin Yun was talking about. Lin Yun was talking about his sword. Zhao Yan’s lips twitched before he said, “The Flower Burial Sword is truly impressive, and my sword pales in comparison.”

When he was done praising the Flower Burial Sword, he could hear two hums from Lin Yun’s sword as if it was snorting. Then, it returned to its sheath.
