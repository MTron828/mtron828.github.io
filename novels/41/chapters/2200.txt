Chapter 2201: Why Aren’t You Guys Backing Down!

As Zhao Tianyu’s aura began to climb, streaks of lightning ripped across the horizon with the Celestial Pool brightly lit like the day. At the same time, layers of heavenly screens rose above him, showing that he had long reached the Sacred Flame Stage of the Heavvenly Origin Phase.

“Big Brother Bai Xiao, you guys back down first,” Lin Yun said with a grave expression with no fear in his eyes. Once the fight breaks out later, it would be hard for him to take care of these people.

“Divine Son.” Gu Xinyu frowned as he watched Bai Xiao leave with the other Golden Guards. He wanted to persuade Zhao Tianyu into leaving them behind. But Zhao Tianyu had ignored him with his gaze locked onto Lin Yun and Bai Shuying.

Lin Yun turned to look at Wang Muyan, who had become a different person. The divinity on her was faint in the past, but it could be sensed now, which made this weird. This divinity didn’t come from one’s cultivation but a person’s temperament. It was the same as looking at some Buddha statues.

“Wang Muyan, does your promise still count?” Lin Yun didn’t say it too straightforwardly. Wang Muyan once swore the Heavenly Dao Oath that she wouldn’t harm anyone in the Heavenly Dao Sect.

Strictly speaking, she was already on the verge of breaking her oath when she attacked the Nether Orchid Sword Array with the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda. The situation at the Nether Orchid Courtyard was complicated now, but it was acceptable if he could leave with Bai Shuying and the Golden Guards. He didn’t dare to act rashly despite knowing that the Solar Lunar Divine Rune was here.

The Sovereign Divine Ruine was important, but it was an external object, so it wasn’t as important as a human’s life. He still didn’t know about his senior brother’s current situation. What was of utmost importance was to take Bai Shuying with him and join up with his senior brother. As for the Solar Lunar Divine Rune, he could only try something in the future.

Hearing what Lin Yun said, Wang Muyan was calm as she replied, “I’m only here for the Celestial Pool, so I won’t stop you if you want to leave with her.”

Lin Yun breathed a sigh of relief. This was because Wang Muyan had become unfathomable now that she could control the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda. If she and Zhao Tianyu joined forces, it might cause some trouble for him. Then again, that didn’t mean that there weren’t any countermeasures.

“Don’t tell me that you think you can leave? The Divine Maiden might’ve agreed to it, but not me,” Zhao Tianyu said as lightning began to flash on Zhao Tianyu’s face that made his face look eerie.

“Don’t tell me that you really think that you can defeat me?” Lin Yun wore a playful smile. Back then, the Divine Lightning Eye caught him by surprise, which was why his senior brother arrived. But that didn’t mean he couldn’t put up any resistance against Zhao Tianyu.

Zhao Tianyu said, “Isn’t it? I only need a look to defeat you.”

“Why don’t you give it a try, then?” Lin Yun asked.

“Don’t regret it, then!” Zhao Tianyu released his Divine Lightning Eye with lightning filling every corner of this place. Before the Divine Lightning Eye opened, the two sword stars in Lin Yun’s sword sea reacted.

].

The first time they fought, Lin Yun’s sword intent shattered before he could even release it. But he was different now. When Zhao Tianyu’s Divine Lightning Eye opened, a golden radiance shone from Lin Yun’s forehead as he released his Astral Sword Intent.

When the two sword stars flew out from him and hovered above him, sunlight and moonlight shone down with over a thousand galaxies rippling. No matter how powerful the Divine Lightning Eye were, the sun and moon weren’t affected at all

“Ha!” Zhao Tianyu sneered. “Is that the best you can do? Die, then!”

When the Divine Lightning Eye opened, Zhao Tianyu also circulated the Undying Phoenix Scripture. The Divine Lightning Eye changed as three blood seals appeared, and each blood seal looked like a crimson phoenix. Space before him shattered, and a destructive aura swept over along with his gaze.

Lin Yun reached out to pull Bai Shuying behind him. At the same time, Lin Yun controlled the galaxies to spread out, but the galaxies were soon destroyed with sword rays becoming dim. Only indigo lightning existed in this region, filled with a destructive aura, wreaking havoc in this world.

“Ye Qingtian, I already said that I only need a look to defeat you.” Zhao Tianyu’s eyes flashed, then he turned to look at the sword ray.

But when the sword ray was extinguished, Zhao Tianyu was shocked to discover that Lin Yun was unaffected, and his sword aura showed no signs of collapsing.

“That makes no sense. I have clearly destroyed your galaxies.” Zhao Tianyu was shocked, but his face changed when he raised his head. The galaxies and sword ray had been extinguished, even the two sword stars looked dim. But he saw two crystals, one golden and one silver, hovering above the sky glowing like stars.

“The Sun Star Crystal and Moon Star Crystal?” Zhao Tianyu opened his mouth because he recognized it as a sign that the Astral Sword Intent had reached the pinnacle.

“Is that the best your Divine Lightning Eye can do?” Lin Yun smiled as the two sword stars ignited once more. When they shone brightly, countless stars gathered into galaxies once more, and Lin Yun’s Astral Sword Intent didn’t just return, but had reached a new height.

“I have a sword for you to experience.” Facing an opponent of Zhao Tianyu’s level, Lin Yun didn’t hesitate to use Light of the Beginning. When he drew his sword, phenomena bloomed, and it looked like the first gleam of light in the world, easily dissipating the Divine Lightning Eye.

This attack was so fast and was also Lin Yun’s strongest attack. He had relied on this to slay a Quasi-Saint when he was only at the Nirvana Stage. Now that he was much stronger than before, the power of this sword was also different.

But Zhao Tianyu reached out with a red lotus blooming on the back of his figure as the Red Lotus Karma Flame ignited beneath him. With a gentle pat of his hand, he knocked the sword away before wearing a smug look on his face, and he smiled, “Light of the Beginning, I have heard of it for a long time, but it doesn’t look that impressive.”

Many people knew that Ye Qingtian had a powerful sword, and there were rumors that he used it to defeat Gu Xinyan during the Blue Dragon Record. But this sword was easily blocked by Zhao Tianyu today.

“This is only the beginning,” Lin Yun smiled, and his sword technique changed before Zhao Tianyu could respond.

“Boundless of the Beginning!” This time, mountains and rivers began to appear in the new world that Lin Yun had created with his phenomenon. There were no traces in this sword, but it contained the massive power of mountains, the majesty of rivers, and the boundless life force of plants.

A new world was born, and everything seemed tiny before it. This might seem like a casual sword, but it gave off the feeling that it was invincible and nothing could confront it.

Before Zhao Tianyu’s smile could bloom on his face, he threw out a mouthful of blood with a hole the size of a fist created on his chest. This was a deep wound. At the same time, he was sent flying by the sword aura, which this caught him by surprise.

“The third sword, Glory of the Beginning!” Before Zhao Tianyu landed on the ground, Lin Yun already unleashed his third sword. This time, the sun and moon were born into the new world as Lin Yun divided himself into two, swinging a sword out each.

When the sword ray he released intertwined with the sun and moon, it was like a barrier that enveloped Zhao Tianyu, followed by an unimaginable explosion.

When Zhao Tianyu landed on the ground, he was covered in wounds, and there wasn’t a patch of skin left on his body. This shocked Gu Xinyu to the point that his mouth was wide open. He hadn’t seen Zhao Tianyu in such a pathetic state before.

Lin Yun stepped back with a flash and sheathed his sword. He no longer bothered with Zhao Tianyu, but looked at Wang Muyan.

However, Wang Muyan didn’t speak as Lin Yun pulled Bai Shuying and soared to the sky, “Let’s go!”

“White Dew, stop them!” Zhao Tianyu roared as he coughed. The guardian responsible for protecting Zhao Tianyu appeared before Lin Yun and Bai Shuying. This was a Saint Sovereign, releasing a terrifying saint aura that made Lin Yun and Bai Shuying feel powerless.

“Get lost!” Just when that Saint Sovereign wanted to make a move against Lin Yun, a snort resounded as Lil’ Purple flew out from the Iris Secret Realm, releasing a dazzling silver radiance as her hair began to grow. The two divine runes on her forehead shone brightly. Aside from the Azure Dragon and Ice Phoenix Divine Runes, Lil’ Purple still had two terrifying Sovereign Divine Runes on her.

In the next moment, she fused the two Sovereign Divine Runes from the Iris Secret Realm into her body, and the aura she gave off reached an unimaginable height. At this moment, she looked like an ancient deity, and no one could look at her directly.

When she pushed her palm forth, this caught the White Dew Saint Sovereign by surprise and was suppressed by her.

As Lil’ Purple hovered in the air, she coldly looked down at the trio, and her appearance became blurred. The divinity that she gave off at this moment was even stronger and more ancient than Wang Muyan.

The White Dew Saint Sovereign’s face changed, and she didn’t dare to make a move, appearing behind Zhao Tianyu. The White Dew Saint Sovereign asked with uncertainty, “Senior, who are you?”

Not far away, Wang Muyan’s face also changed as though she was facing a formidable foe.

“Listen well,” Lil’ Purple said coldly. “I’m the Divine Phoenix Clan’s Supreme Heavenly Slaughter Empress of Four Seas, Eight Barrens, 36 Heavens, and 72 Earths!”

The long name left everyone dumbfounded, and Wang Muyan muttered, “The Heavenly Slaughter Empress?”

“Since you know my name, why aren’t you guys backing down!” Lil’ Purple’s cold voice resounded.

On the other hand, Gu Xinyu’s lips twitched because they only knew about her title after Lil’ Purple introduced herself.
