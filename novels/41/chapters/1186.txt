Chapter 1187 - Center Of Attention

Lin Yun’s face didn’t change despite being the center of attention. He didn’t care about the gazes of others nor did he care about Yan Zijing’s provocation. After all, trash like Yan Zijing wasn’t worthy of him. He even felt that killing Yan Zijing would dirty his hands.

“Xiaoyu, are the rumors true? Did Lin Yun blind one of your maids and claim that he would step on us in the Sword Assembly?” Feng Xingyang asked. The rumors were too exaggerated so he didn’t think they were real. He could even sense a few holes in the rumors.

Feng Xingyang’s question instantly drew everyone’s attention because they knew that they could get the truth from Feng Xiaoyu. Even the four strongest experts were waiting on Feng Xiaoyu.

“He blinded my maid and even slapped my other maids. It’s not a secret and many people have witnessed it,” said Feng Xiaoyu. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“So it’s really true!”

“That fellow acted too cruelly just to get an invitation.”

“Not only did he snatch the invitation, he even claimed that he would sweep through the Sword Assembly and leave with the Thousand Lightning. How arrogant!”

“Hmph. He’s just a lowly ant in the Heavenly Soul Realm.”

“He’ll die once he gets to the stage. So what if he’s a genius from the Profound Azure Prefecture? He’s merely a frog in the well.”

Feng Xiaoyu’s words instantly caused an uproar among those in the plaza. At the same time, many people were staring coldly at Lin Yun. Once they confirmed that Feng Xiaoyu was telling the truth about the maids, they had no trouble believing the other rumors.

However, she withheld the reason why Lin Yun injured her maids. If they knew about it, they wouldn’t act so hatefully.

“I didn’t say those words. Since the Sword Assembly doesn’t welcome me, it will be fine if I don’t participate.” Lin Yun stood up and left. Feng Xiaoyu was from the Feng Clan, and the Hidden Sword Pavilion had clearly allowed her to accuse him. In his view, swordsmen should be righteous, so he had no interest in such a foul Sword Assembly.

Seeing that Lin Yun wanted to leave, Yan Zijing roared, “Lin Yun, you dare to claim that you didn’t say those words before? I heard you say that you would sweep through the Sword Assembly with my own ears. Back then, you even launched a sneak attack on me. So I want to have a proper fight with you today!”

The crowd instantly looked at Lin Yun with mocking gazes. They believed that Lin Yun only won the fight against Yan Zijing because he used a despicable tactic. Otherwise, there would be no need for Lin Yun to be scared to fight.

“You want to come and go as you wish? Who do you think you are?” Feng Xingyang roared from the stage, “Stop him!”

The guards of the Feng Clan instantly appeared on the plaza as the head guard sneered, “Didn’t you say that you want to sweep through the Sword Assembly and take the Thousand Lightning Sword? Why are you in such a hurry to leave?”

The guard’s words instantly caused an outburst of laughter from the geniuses in the surroundings. When Yan Zijing saw this scene, he was reassured that Lin Yun was trying to escape. If Lin Yun was stronger, then there was no need for Lin Yun to leave at all.

He sneered, “Lin Yun, I’ll give you a chance to prove yourself by fighting me!”

Seeing the mocking gaze from the guards, Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with a cold light. He was mad that they were provoking him. He truly didn’t have any interest in the Sword Assembly. The old geezer was the only reason why he was here. “You want a fight? I’ll give you a fight then!”

At this moment, Lin Yun was thoroughly pissed off. He never caused trouble intentionally, but that didn’t mean that he was afraid of trouble. As soon as he turned around, he appeared on the stage. His speed completely shocked the crowd.

Seeing Lin Yun’s speed, Yan Zijing’s heart began to tremble before he said, “Lin Yun, this is the Sword Assembly and we’re only competing with our swords, not cultivation or physique. I believe you know the rules.”

He was afraid of Lin Yun’s strong physique, not to mention that he had suffered greatly two days ago. If Feng Xiaoyu didn’t give him a saint pellet, he definitely wouldn’t be able to return to top condition.

Lin Yun waved his hand to summon the Flower Burial Sword and said, “Come on.”

“Hmph!” Yan Zijing drew his sword without a word and unleashed his sky sword intent and holy spirit at the same time. He didn’t hold back and immediately unleashed a strong sword ray.

Before the holy spirit fully appeared, Yan Zijing had already stabbed out with his sword. When his sword arrived before Lin Yun, an immense sword aura descended with cold light flickering on the sword tip.

But Lin Yun casually swung his sword. His sword was like a light that tore through the darkness. It was so fast that no one could react. With a shattering sound, Yan Zijing threw up a mouthful of blood. He was frozen still as his sword shattered from Lin Yun’s attack.

The only thing that remained of Yan Zijing’s sword was the hilt. Naturally, he began to tremble in fear that Lin Yun would decapitate him.

“I lost.” Yan Zijing quickly admitted his loss before he felt relieved. After all, taking the life of an opponent was prohibited in the Sword Assembly.

But the moment he spoke out, blood splattered out of his neck. When this happened, Lin Yun took three steps back to avoid the splashing blood.

“Lin Yun, killing is forbidden in the Sword Assembly. Y-Y-You’re dead!” Yan Zijing roared while he held onto his neck.

“I didn’t take your life. You’re just heavily injured, and you won’t die if you don’t speak.” Technically, Lin Yun was right. However, Yan Zijing’s situation was temporary and he was already doomed.

This scene made everyone suck in a cold breath.

“Damn it!” Feng Xiaoyu gnashed her teeth because she failed to teach Lin Yun a lesson with Yan Zijing.

“Lin Yun’s sword technique isn’t bad…”

“Yeah. He’s not as weak as Yan Zijing claimed. At the very least, 70% of the people here can’t avoid that attack.”

“70%? You’re underestimating him. In my opinion, at least 80% of the people here can’t avoid his sword!” This was the Sword Assembly, and all the geniuses here had grasped the sky sword intent. Naturally, everyone present was a decent swordsman.

It was clear to everyone present how strong Lin Yun was. Clearly, he would fare well in the Sword Assembly.

“Feng Xiaoyu, you know what happened back then and I’ve already given you some face. Don’t push it because I’m not someone who will go easy on a woman,” said Lin Yun coldly with killing intent brimming in his pupils.

His words instantly left everyone dumbfounded because they couldn’t believe that someone dared to speak up to Feng Xiaoyu in the Sword Assembly. She was the pearl of the pavilion master, but Lin Yun didn’t bother giving him any face.

When Lin Yun finished, he turned around and began to leave. He didn’t want to waste any more time. However, a figure appeared on the stage and stood in Lin Yun’s path, “Lin Yun, you want to leave after blinding my younger sister? I’ll let you leave, but you have to leave your eyes behind!”

It took a long time for Lin Yun to realize that the newcomer was talking about Feng Xiaoyun’s favorite maid. However, he ended up looking at Feng Xiaoyu.

Seeing Lin Yun’s gaze, Feng Xiaoyu mocked, “Who the hell you are? Do you think I need to give you face? I seem to recall you knelt before me for the invitation and then attacked my maids when I refused to give it to you. Do you think you’re strong just because you defeated Yan Zijing? Do you think that no one here can deal with you? If you’re brave enough, let me see how you sweep through the Sword Assembly.”

The moment Feng Xiaoyu finished, an uproar broke out on the plaza. The local geniuses of the city were even looking at Lin Yun with rage in their pupils.
