Chapter 1438 - I Don't Need You To Think

Everything took place too quickly, and Chen Ling lost before he could see Lin Yun’s attack. As for Lin Yun, he didn’t pursue Chen Ling any further. He landed on the ground and reached out with his right hand, “Thanks for the fight.”

Chen Ling gasped for breath as his eyes became dull while looking at Lin Yun, who stretched his hand out. He was surprised when he saw this. Lin Yun wanted to pull him up? Was he mocking him or taking pity on him?

But after a while, Chen Ling wore a wry smile before he held onto Lin Yun’s hand. Lin Yun pulled hard and brought Chen Ling back to his feet.

“Are you alright?” Lin Yun wasn’t able to hold back in the last attack. Chen Ling wasn’t an enemy, and he would feel guilty if Chen Ling’s injuries were too severe.

Chen Ling patted his chest, indicating that he was fine. He smiled. “I’m fine. You won. Flower Burial, you really live up to your reputation.”

His smile was bitter, and because he patted himself on his chest too hard, it made him throw out a mouthful of blood. He was severely injured, and he was weak right now. This made the atmosphere awkward as Chen Ling’s face turned pale, and he couldn’t utter a word.

Saint Pool Square fell into silence as many people had shock in their pupils. They were still immersed in the scene when Chen Ling took the initiative to break his wings to block Lin Yun’s attack. But who could’ve thought he would be defeated in the next second?

Based on the strength Chen Ling demonstrated, he was stronger than many Heavenly Elysium Core Realm direct disciples. They didn’t doubt that Chen Ling could enter the top thirty on the Earth Ranking, especially since he grasped the Primordial Netherserpent Sword. This trump card of his had shocked everyone.

Logically speaking, it should be impossible for him to lose. But he was still defeated by Lin Yun. When everyone’s gaze fell onto Lin Yun, they couldn’t conceal the shock in their eyes. Lin Yun truly lived up to his reputation as the strongest genius of the Heavenly Paths. He had only been in the Kunlun Realm for a year and joined the Sword Sect for three days. But he was stronger than most disciples in the sect, especially when he summoned four constellations. This brought Lin Yun to the height of a monster, and perhaps Lin Yun could be the turning point of the Divine Firmament Peak.

“Feng Luan, take Chen Ling to the Emerald Firmament Peak to treat his injuries.” Mu Chuan appeared as he hovered in the sky.

Feng Luan nodded. Chen Ling’s injuries were severe, and he had to be sent to the Emerald Firmament Peak quickly so he wouldn’t leave behind any hidden injuries.

“Wait!” Lin Yun suddenly stopped Feng Luan before he raised his head to look at Mu Chuan and cupped his hands, “Peak Master, I have something to say. I wonder if you can wait for me to finish before making a decision?”

“Go on.” Mu Chuan furrowed his brows, not knowing what Lin Yun was trying to do. Everyone at Saint Pool Square was also puzzled by Lin Yun’s actions.

“I wish to invite Senior Brother Chen to join me in the Saint Pool Baptism!” Lin Yun looked at the peak master and said something no one could believe. Everyone’s eyes were filled with disbelief, and even Chen Ling, who Feng Luan supported, was speechless.

Mu Chuan was also surprised to hear that and was shocked.

“Are you sure about that?” Mu Chuan sent a weird look to Lin Yun. There had only been one quota for the Saint Pool Baptism, and no one had ever made such a request.

“I’m sure…” Lin Yun turned to look at Chen Ling and said, “Senior Brother Chen, what do you think of my suggestion?”

“I… I… I don’t think that’s appropriate.” Chen Ling said embarrassingly.

“I also don’t think that it’s appropriate, too.” Mu Chuan looked at Lin Yun; he had no idea what was in Lin Yun’s mind.

“I don’t need you to think. It’s fine as long as I think that it’s appropriate.” Lin Yun smiled. His words left Chen Ling dumbfounded, and he couldn’t figure out why Lin Yun would dare to speak to the peak master in this manner.

Mu Chuan’s face also changed and was clearly furious. He coldly said, “There has never been such a rule!”

“I believe it’s a reward given to me by the sect master. Since it’s my reward, why can’t I deal with it myself?” Lin Yun asked.

“The astral energy accumulated in the Saint Pool is limited. It’s your reward from the sect to lift the seal up to the ninth layer, but you must know that it’s limited and depends on your ability to see how much you can obtain. It’s different if you invite someone else along. If you invite everyone with you, what will happen if you empty the Saint Pool?” Mu Chuan explained with a helpless smile.

Then again, it was impossible to empty the Saint Pool, and his words were somewhat exaggerated. But rules were implemented for a reason, and they couldn’t be broken. Not to mention that if someone invited someone to join them, it would be a considerable loss if that person benefited more than you.

“Since that’s the case, I’ll give up and let Senior Brother Chen have it, instead. I’ll just wait for next year; I can afford to wait. But I ask for the peak master to consider it seriously. I feel that even if Senior Brother Chen isn’t qualified to receive the Saint Pool Baptism, he’s qualified to become a direct disciple. I hope you won’t hold him back just because of me.” Lin Yun said after a brief pondering.

“Are you serious? Nine layers of the seal will be undone. Do you have an idea how precious this opportunity is?” Mu Chuan barked.

“I’m serious.” Lin Yun had no intention of backing down.

Meanwhile, Feng Luan and Chen Ling were dumbfounded to the point of being completely speechless.

The corner of Mu Chuan’s lips twitched when he heard that, and he even wanted to vomit blood because of how stubborn Lin Yun was. But he suddenly closed his eyes and briefly moved his lips as a faint ripple spread out in the surroundings. He was communicating with someone through transmission, which instantly caused an uproar.

“Oh my god, Lin Yun is serious about this. The peak master nearly threw out blood because of him.”

“How exciting. Lin Yun is really bold!”

“But he’s not exactly wrong. He can afford to wait because he’s only twenty this year. But Senior Brother Chen can’t afford to wait any longer.”

“I understand, but who can have a breadth of mind like him?” When everyone looked at Lin Yun this time, the depths of their eyes were flickering with admiration. If everyone had only acknowledged Lin Yun’s strength previously, they were impressed by his selflessness this time.

They didn’t think they could do the same as Lin Yun if they were in his position, not to mention that what he said to the peak master was that he didn’t need the peak master to think if it was appropriate as long as he felt that it was. It sounded strange, but it sounded really domineering.

When Mu Chuan suddenly opened his eyes, a powerful explosion of sword aura swept out and the entire Saint Pool Square fell silent. His gaze was sharp, and he looked at Lin Yun. “The sect master has agreed to it. He has permitted you and Chen Ling to receive the Saint Pool Baptism.”

“I thank the sect master and peak master for fulfilling my request!” Lin Yun smiled while cupping his hands together.

Mu Chuan flashed and appeared beside Chen Ling before placing his hand on the latter’s shoulder. As his samsara aura coursed through Chen Ling’s body, he was surprised. Chen Ling’s injuries weren’t as severe as he had imagined, and it appears that Lin Yun held back in his attack. When his hand left Chen Ling’s shoulder, Chen Ling’s face became rosier as he trembled. After he stopped, he cupped his hands together, “Thank you, Peak Master.”

“Don’t thank me.” Mu Chuan replied. “I will only follow the rules, just like how you challenged Lin Yun. I won’t intervene as long as it’s within the rules. He’s the one who broke it, so you have to keep this in mind. We’re all swordsmen, but remember that we’re men before we’re swordsmen.”

“I know,” Chen Ling nodded.

“Come with me.” Mu Chuan said before he looked at Lin Yun and said in an annoyed tone, “You too.”

“Alrighty!” Lin Yun smiled.

Mu Chuan kept his face straight and ignored Lin Yun, but he was surprised by Lin Yun’s temper. Lin Yun might seem cold and ruthless, but his heart was unexpectedly soft since he was willing to give up on the Saint Pool Baptism for someone he met for the first time. Perhaps this was also the reason why his master chose him. Now that he thought about it again, Lin Yun was really similar to his Junior Brother Jian. They were both stubborn, and no one could change their minds once they made their decision.

But the gentleness in Lin Yun’s heart should be unique, and not many people could understand that.

“Senior Brother, sorry about that earlier.” Lin Yun smiled as they flew towards the Saint Pool.

“Oh? Do you remember that I’m your senior brother now? You were so domineering earlier that I thought you were the senior brother between us!” Mu Chuan glared at Lin Yun.

Over the past three days, Lin Yun naturally found out that the peak master was also a disciple of the Radiant Sword Saint. But he had no idea what his ranking was amongst the disciples. But this senior brother was a little proud, seeming cold despite caring for him a lot.

They didn’t take long to reach the abyss where the waterfalls converged. Mu Chuan looked at Lin Yun and said, “Junior Brother, you’re a direct disciple of the Divine Firmament Peak starting today. If anyone dares to bully you, you can just use the Sword Sect’s name!”

His words made Lin Yun feel warmth before he smiled, “I have a good temper. So I believe that no one will bully me.”

“Haha!” Mu Chuan smiled before he turned to Chen Ling, “Starting from today, you’re also a direct disciple of my Divine Firmament Peak!”

“But this isn’t according to the rules…” Chen Ling was stumped.

“I don’t need you to feel if it’s appropriate as long as I feel that it is!” Mu Chuan replied.

The corner of Lin Yun’s lips twitched when he heard that. He knew that his senior brother was still holding a grudge against him. As Mu Chuan began to undo the seals, he said, “Let’s start with the Saint Pool Baptism. The longer you stay in the Saint Pool, the more benefits you’ll receive. Don’t be frightened by what I said earlier. You guys can take as much as you want because I won’t feel bad about it.”

When the ninth layer of the seal was undone, Mu Chuan roared, “Lin Yun, Chen Ling, enter quickly!”

Hearing Mu Chuan’s words, Lin Yun and Chen Ling quickly prepared themselves. They calmed themselves down and took a deep breath before they jumped into the Saint Pool.
