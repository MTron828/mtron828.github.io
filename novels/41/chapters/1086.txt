Chapter 1087 - Let’s Meet Again In Kunlun Realm!

Yue Weiwei instantly became nervous when she heard Lin Yun’s words. At the same time, she felt a warm current flowing through her heart. But she quickly pushed that feeling to the side because she was afraid that Lin Yun and her Third Senior Brother would start a conflict.

“I’m not obligated to answer you,” smiled Chen Xun with a playful tone.

Yue Weiwei smiled, “Third Senior Brother, you’re not allowed to speak to Big Brother Yun in that manner.”

Depressed, Chen Xun put his face in his hands. Yue Weiwei was helping an outsider instead of him. Wearing a playful smile, he then replied, “Are you ready for my answer?”

“Go ahead,” replied Lin Yun.

Yue Weiwei lowered her head in embarrassment, not daring to look at Chen Xun or Lin Yun.

Chen Xun smiled, “This little lass ran out on her own to a lower realm. My master has a lot of enemies, so you can imagine how furious he was when he found out about it. Before he sent me out, he told me not to do anything unless her life was in danger. He wanted to teach her a lesson for her recklessness.”

“Although she suffered quite a bit in the hands of the Nether Divinity Realm Son, I can guarantee that the Nether Divinity Realm Son didnt touch a strand of her hair. You know, our missy here is close to you. After all, she won’t even let other guys touch her.”

“Senior Brother, what are you talking about!” Yue Weiwei yelled with a red face.

But Chen Xun ignored her and continued, “I can understand how you feel. But I’ve known her longer than you. I would’ve saved her long ago if it wasn’t for my master's orders. Then again, I have to admit that you surprised me when you slaughtered your way through Wind Mound City.”

Chen Xun had admiration in his eyes when he spoke. After all, he had witnessed the fight. He could also understand why Yue Weiwei was so close to him.

After hearing the explanation, Lin Yun examined Yue Weiwei’s face and knew that Chen Xun wasn’t bluffing. But right at this moment, Yue Weiwei revealed a gentle smile and said, “Senior Brother, I-I’ve found the Divine Blood Fruit. Big Brother Yun even found one with seven leaves for me.”

Chen Xun’s face changed when he heard that. He realized why Yue Weiwei was so calm even after he had found her. Chen Xun began to hesitate for a long time before he said, “Missy, master wanted us to tell you after we found you that the mistress isn’t in deep slumber. The Divine Blood Fruit can’t wake her up. Master only said it to comfort you. He didn’t really think that you would run away to look for one.”

When Yue Weiwei heard that, she became stunned. Her face turned pale and her body started trembling. With tears welling up in her eyes, Yue Weiwei cried in a despaired tone, “Senior Brother, you’re lying to me, right? My mother isn’t dead. She’s going to wake up with the Divine Blood Fruit, right?”

She left home under the belief that her mother would wake up. She never thought of the possibility that her mother wouldn’t wake up even with the Divine Blood Fruit.

She yearned for her mother’s embrace. She had lots of things to tell her, the happiness and sadness she experienced over the past decade. But now, her dream collapsed.

“The Divine Blood Fruit is rare in Kunlun Realm, but the master wouldn’t hesitate to put his life on the line if it could save the mistress. Over the years, you thought that the master didn’t love the mistress and that he wasn’t willing to pay the price to wake her up. You really don’t know how he feels. He loves the mistress, and he loves you even more,” sighed Chen Xun.

“Is that really true?” Yue Weiwei bit her lips in disbelief, but her rationale told her that Chen Xun wasn’t lying to her.

“Mistress, you’re a smart girl. You know I’m telling the truth, right?” Chen Xun sighed, which made Yue Weiwei tear up even more. How could she not have guessed this before? F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Don’t be reckless anymore and come back with me. Master is really worried about you,” said Chen Xun.

Yue Weiwei was greatly affected by those words and it took a long time for her to stop her tears before she smiled, “Big Brother Yun, I’ll have to return the Divine Blood Fruit to you.”

When she was done, she took out the jade bottle with the Divine Blood Fruit in it and handed it to Lin Yun. It was initially a gift from Lin Yun, so she gave it back to him.

Lin Yun didn't know how to comfort Yue Weiwei. Taking the jade bottle, Lin Yun looked at Yue Weiwei for a long time before he asked, “Are you going to leave?”

“Big Brother Yun, you have to come and look for me,” smiled Yue Weiwei. As she spoke, she removed the jade flute by her waist and looked at Lin Yun gently, “Big Brother Yun has treated me well, regardless if we were in the Profound Amber Realm or in the Heavenly Path. I have nothing to give you. This flute has stayed with me for a long time. So I would like to give it to you.”

When Chen Xun saw this scene, his heart sank because this flute belonged to the mistress. He knew what it meant to Yue Weiwei, and the meaning behind giving it to Lin Yun. But Lin Yun merely looked at it and didn’t receive it. There were many people who were frivolous with love, but he couldn’t be that way because his heart already belonged to someone. Plus, he wanted to keep it that way.

He wasn’t stupid, so he knew what Yue Weiwei was doing. He also knew what it meant to Yue Weiwei if he didn’t accept it.

Seeing that Lin Yun didn’t accept it, Yue Weiwei’s smile froze. She thought this would happen, but she still felt shocked. But when Chen Xun saw this, he instantly became furious, “Lin Yun, don’t push it!”

Tears continued to well up in Yue Weiwei’s eyes as she squeezed out a smile, looking like a feeble flower in the snow. Many people on the Saint Spiritual Lake looked at Lin Yun enviously. After all, no one could resist Yue Weiwei’s beauty after looking at her. She was practically the goddess of their dreams.

And Lin Yun was only one step away from having it all as long as he received the jade flute. Many people looked at Lin Yun enviously while they gritted their teeth. All they could do was sigh at their poor fortune.

“Big Brother Yun, I’ve never wanted to fight for anything. I just hope that you won’t forget me. I hope that you can remember me whenever you see this flute,” said Yue Weiwei gently.

Taking the jade flute, Lin Yun replied, “I won’t forget about you even without this flute. I once promised you that anyone who becomes your enemy will also be an enemy of mine. This promise of mine won’t change.”

“I know, Big Brother Yun. So we’ll meet again in Kunlun Realm,” smiled Yue Weiwei with bright eyes. Looking at Yue Weiwei, Chen Xun shook his head because he knew that Yue Weiwei was too deeply poisoned by Lin Yun’s charm. He didn’t think that a brat in the Heavenly Soul Realm was worthy of his missy.

Watching them leave, Lin Yun let out a long sigh. He then remembered that he once said he would not be a fool when it came to love.

“Brat, can we leave now?” Feng Jue smiled, appearing out of nowhere.

“Yeah.” Lin Yun looked at the jade flute in his hand briefly before nodding his head.

Looking at Lin Yun and Feng Jue leaving, the elders of the other sects felt weird because they knew that Lin Yun would definitely rise in Kunlun Realm. They weren’t sure if they made the right choice by not recruiting Lin Yun.

“No need to feel pity. What he did is so serious that not even the Sword Sect can protect him.”

“That’s right. There’s no way Elder Jin Jue will let this matter go, especially since Lin Yun declared that he wanted to kill Elder Jin Jue. Looks like it won’t be long before Lin Yun gets killed in Kunlun Realm.”

“He’s talented in the sword path, but there’s nothing else impressive about him compared to geniuses in Kunlun Realm. Who knows, he might even become a nameless person in Kunlun Realm.” The elders who were feeling unhappy were trying to comfort themselves by wishing bad things on Lin Yun’s.

Feng Jue, who was leaving with Lin Yun, smiled, “Brat, do you hear them? Don’t you think you should do something in response to their words?”

“They will regret it one day.” Lin Yun had no emotions on his face, but he was greatly affected by those words. He would make all of them pay in the future.

After Lin Yun left, the elders stayed behind to recruit disciples. Although there was no one as dazzling as Lin Yun, they could still pick a few as outer disciples. However, they didn’t have much hopes that anyone would become a core disciple. Then again, becoming core disciples was nothing in Kunlun Realm.

Not long after, the powerful elders left and handed the rest to the deacons of their sects. With that, the Heavenly Path that had been ongoing for a year had finally come to an end. Luo Chen and his party weren’t picked by any of the sects, but they also didn’t choose to return to their realms. Instead, they boarded the Sacred Alliance’s ship to head to the Sacred Alliance for three months.

But when they went on the ship, they were instantly brought to Luo Qingxu. When they were brought before Luo Qingxu, they became nervous because they knew how strong he was. After all, even someone like Elder Jin Jue could do nothing before him.

At the same time, they were baffled that Luo Qingxu would meet them personally, which made them anxious.

“Luo Chen.” Luo Qingxu looked at him and took out the Flame Dragon’s Heart, “Take it. Lin Yun requested me to give it to you. It’s extremely dangerous to fuse with this heart, but it’ll also benefit you greatly if you succeed. So the choice is yours.”

Looking at the Flame Dragon’s Heart, Luo Chen and his party were dumbfounded because they never expected that Lin Yun would leave it behind. But Luo Qingxu didn’t stop there and took out the leaves of the Nine-Leaf Saint Fruit, “Lin Yun also left behind these leaves for all of you, so you can split it among yourselves.”

Luo Chen and his party were completely speechless that Lin Yun would give them leaves from the Nine-Leaf Saint Fruit. But Luo Qingxu continued calmly, “Lin Yun didn’t come in contact with you guys earlier because it wasn’t appropriate given the amount of people who wanted him dead. So he gave them to me secretly to prevent any of you running into trouble.”

They were happy that Lin Yun could be accepted by the Sword Sect, but they were also somewhat disappointed that Lin Yun merely took a few glances at them. They thought that Lin Yun was really heartless. But at this moment, they knew that they had misunderstood him

Then, Luo Chen held onto the Flame Dragon’s Heart and made up his mind that he would pay the Sword Sect a visit in the future no matter what.
