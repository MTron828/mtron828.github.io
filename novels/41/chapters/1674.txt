Chapter 1675 – Fated Encounter

Seven days later, Lin Yun finally reached the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea. This was a massive ocean, with the air covered in a faint fog that gave off a bizarre, mysterious, and ancient feeling.

The Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea was an ancient ground that had existed since ancient times. Back then, it was a hovering star. Since that star was enveloped in a celestial fog for an extended period, it was massive, and many ancient holy lands were situated on this star. This gigantic star came from beyond the thirty-six layers of heaven and was known as an ancient ground from the previous era.

It had a great origin back then and was comparable to the nine ancient domains. It was also called the Heavenly Domain as it hovered in the air. There was no Unholy Sea in ancient times. But a brutal battle took place back then, and the Heavenly Domain collapsed into countless islands on the sea, and the bottom of the sea was dyed red from the blood, causing many bizarre incidents. Thus, it was called the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea now.

The celestial sea from before became eerie, and it was no longer suitable as a place of inheritance. A hundred thousand years have passed, and the various forces shifted their location, causing the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea to become an unowned land, which could be considered the heart of the Eastern Desolation.

It might seem massive, but it was only an inner sea in the Eastern Desolation. Lin Yun knew nothing about the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea, and he had no idea who was ruling it or the forces there. The Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea was weird, as though there was an ominous aura at the bottom of the sea. Thus, if one traveled on the river for a long time, one would suffer the invasion of the ominous aura. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

He wouldn’t be bothered by it if he could still circulate his dragon origin, and this border region wouldn’t be able to affect him. But he couldn’t circulate his dragon origin, and he had to use his sword aura to resist the ominous aura, making it troublesome.

The bottom of the sea was deep and unfathomable, and the Desolate River paled in comparison. Lin Yun quickly ascended a mountain, the Skyflowing Island, to save him some trouble.

The Skyflowing Island was located at the border of the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea. There wasn’t a powerful barrier on this island, and the patrol forces were weak. Lin Yun found a loophole and was routed through the patrol to arrive in a city on the island. He had two objectives in coming here, to buy the Heavenly Snow Lotus and to inquire some information.

There was nothing to say about the Heavenly Snow Lotus because he needed it to completely recover from his injuries. After all, it was too long to wait, and he had to obtain it no matter what. As for information, he naturally wanted to know the location of the Nirvana Pavilion as well as what kind of place the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea was.

But he wasn’t in a hurry and strolled through the city while pondering. He walked throughout the city numerous times and couldn’t find the location of the Nirvana Pavilion. Thus, he could only try and find other shops. When he stopped and raised his head, he saw a familiar shop. Looking at the signboard, he muttered, “Heavenly Star Pavilion!”

“There was also a Heavenly Star Pavilion here?” The Heavenly Star Pavilion was a chamber of commerce on the surface, but it was a powerful demonic sect. The Heavenly Star Pavilion in the Ancient Barren Domain was all under An Liuyan’s control, so he never expected a Heavenly Star Pavilion at the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea.

The Skyflowing Island was small, but the Heavenly Star Pavilion was more significant than any branch in the Ancient Barren Domain. They didn’t seem concerned and brazenly opened their Heavenly Star Pavilion here. After all, most demonic forces kept a low profile in the Ancient Barren Domain and would change their name, disguising themselves.

This shop was bustling with people. Not only did they sell saint artifacts, pellets, and secret treasures, but they also sold demonic pets and slaves. After taking a few looks, Lin Yun walked into the Heavenly Star Pavilion.

“Young Master, are you here to buy or sell?” A beautiful servant walked over the moment he walked in.

When Lin Yun turned around and looked at this woman, he instantly sensed that this woman was at least at the fifth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. This shocked him greatly because he never thought a mere servant would have such high cultivation.

This was a coincidence because this woman was the manager of this branch, and she walked over to Lin Yun because she didn’t sense any peculiar aura from him, nor could she detect Lin Yun’s cultivation. She wouldn’t have attended to the customer if it were someone else.

“Young Master can call me Mo Ling’er. I’m the manager of this pavilion.” Mo Ling’er smiled.

Realizing that she was the manager, Lin Yun calmly said, “I’m here to buy a Heavenly Snow Lotus. I don’t need the complete one; the leaves and seeds also work. Can the Heavenly Star Pavilion find it?”

“Heavenly Snow Lotus?” Mo Ling’er was surprised, and her gaze changed as she looked at Lin Yun. The Heavenly Snow Lotus was a saint elixir commonly used to recover from injuries. A petal could cost up to ten million Divine Astral Pellets; it wasn’t something ordinary people could afford.

One had to be at least at the pinnacle Nirvana Stage because saints mostly used it to recover from their injuries. The Heavenly Snow Lotus was mainly reserved for big customers by various chambers of commerce, not to mention that there was no harm in keeping it. Because a Heavenly Snow Lotus didn’t only mean a huge business but was also a favorite.

Mo Ling’er could sense that Lin Yun wasn’t old and was at least in the Dragon Pulse Realm. So it was a waste for him to use such a precious treasure, which might even damage his foundation. Without a powerful vitality, no one could suppress the massive medicinal power of the Heavenly Snow Lotus.

“The Heavenly Star Pavilion is famous in the Eastern Desolation, and we even have branches in the Divine Dragon Empire. If you can afford it, we can definitely find a Heavenly Snow Lotus for you. But…” Mo Ling’er suddenly smiled. She was pretty composed and did not immediately reject Lin Yun. If it were someone else in her position, Lin Yun would’ve already been chased away.

“But what? I can afford the price.” Lin Yun obtained a lot of saint elixirs in the Ancient Barren Battlefield, not to mention that he killed many people. All of their interspatial pouches were with him, and he had dozens of myriad year saint elixirs.

The other sect geniuses would submit them to their sect and receive a reward, but he didn’t have to do that. Aside from that, he also had a lot of saint artifacts, saint pellets, and an astronomical sum of Divine Astral Pellets.

“Calm down, Young Master.” Mo Ling’er said before she smiled, “Let me ask the head of our branch about it.”

Lin Yun was brought to the third floor to wait, and two servants brought in tea for him. The spiritual tea emitted a faint fragrance from the cup, and the two servants brought up a book that had all of the products sold by the Heavenly Star Pavilion recorded within. Lin Yun didn’t even have to move, and the two servants would read it out for him. But Lin Yun wasn’t too interested because he was anxious about the Heavenly Snow Lotus.

There was an ancient courtyard deep in the Heavenly Star Pavilion, and An Liuyan casually flipped through an ancient book. She had disguised herself as a man, casually lying on a chair covered in white tiger skin. But despite disguising herself, it still couldn’t conceal her voluptuous figure.

When Mo Ling’er came in, An Liuyan finally stood up and asked, “Ling’er, is there any information about him?”

She had been looking for Lin Yun’s information for the past few days, but there were many rumors that Lin Yun had already died in the Ancient Barren Domain. It was said that many people see Saints descending from other domains, and even Emperors destroyed countless mountains. There were various rumors, but there was no exact news about Lin Yun.

Mo Ling’er was her close aide, and she wouldn’t have come if there was nothing significant. Although An Liuyan didn’t say who she was referring to, Mo Ling’er naturally knew who she was talking about. She bitterly smiled, “Missy, what are you thinking about? All the holy lands are looking for him, so he’ll definitely go into hiding, if I was him.”

“Many people say he’s dead, but I don’t want to give up looking for him.” An Liuyan said.

“Don’t worry about it. Young Master Lin is blessed by fortune and is still alive. Missy, you’re here for a mission, and you’ll lose the position as the holy maiden if you fail, not to mention that the divine sect’ll even kill you.” Mo Ling’er smiled.

But An Liuyan didn’t say anything and maintained her silence. She wouldn’t be so worried if it was someone else, but Lin Yun was a different story. If Lin Yun really died, there would be no meaning even if she became the Demon Gate’s holy maiden.

“Why have you come, then?” An Liuyan asked after she recollected herself.

“Someone came to buy a Heavenly Snow Lotus. He’s young and wears a mask. I can’t recognize his origin, either.” Mo Ling’er said.

“Oh?” An Liuyan raised her brow with a chill flashing across her pupils. After she obtained the Divine Dragon Bone and received various opportunities in the Blue Dragon Palace, her strength and mentality were no longer the same as before. She had received a lot of rewards from the Demon Gate as well.

“He’s probably here to mess around.” An Liuyan said coldly.

“He doesn’t look like he’s messing around…” Mo Ling’er said with uncertainty.

“Who in their right mind would come here to buy a Heavenly Snow Lotus? If he’s here for his senior, they’ll definitely inform us beforehand. Who would just barge in and request to buy one?” An Liuyan calmly emphasized.

“Is he from the Blood Moon Sect, then?” Mo Ling’er exclaimed. “Isn’t this too much of a coincidence?”

“The Blood Moon Sect is a great foe of my Demon Gate. So it’s not weird that he knows about my whereabouts. But he might be a saint’s servant for him to come to the Heavenly Star Pavilion by himself.” An Liuyan said coldly.

“I’ll get someone to capture him immediately.” Mo Ling’er said.

“No need. Let him come up. I’ll meet with him myself.” An Liuyan replied.

“Okay.” Mo Ling’er went down and soon brought Lin Yun into the courtyard. There were various buildings on this lake, and there was a cauldron with an astronomical sum of True Dragon Saint Liquid at the bottom.

When Lin Yun reached the lakeside, there was a pavilion, and the pavilion was covered with a veil. He could roughly see a voluptuous figure behind that veil, and several maids were also in the pavilion.

“That is our head.” Mo Ling’er smiled.

When the veil opened, Lin Yun could faintly see a figure. When he activated the Divine Dragon Eyes, his gaze pierced through the veil, and he saw a familiar figure, An Liuyan. This made Lin Yun inwardly alarmed. When he saw An Liuyan raising her head, he quickly turned off the Divine Dragon Eyes.
