Chapter 1608 - Vajra Monastery's Blade Wielder

As golden light exploded from the Pagoda Saint Rune in Lin Yun’s profound palace, it formed a seven-layered pagoda.

The seven-layered pagoda in his profound palace could be considered a Buddhist pagoda, and the pagoda was meant to praise merit in Buddhism. Aside from that, it could also subdue demons and vanquish evil.

The Pagoda Saint Rune was rare, even amongst saint runes, and many powerhouses of the Buddhist cult might be unable to grasp it. When the seven-layered pagoda appeared before him, the gigantic palm that could easily take his life stopped.

After the golden flames were extinguished from the Golden Crow Wings, Lin Yun could circulate his vitality and dragon origin since the previous restriction had been resolved.

“That was dangerous.” Lin Yun said with lingering fear as he wiped the sweat from his forehead. He realized that he couldn’t be careless in the Ancient Barren Battlefield, or he might lose his life if he wasn’t careful. He shouldn’t have used the flames to burn the Buddha statue earlier.

When that Buddha statue slowly retracted its hand, it sank into the ground. The statue was too heavy and soon plunged into the ground after losing its support. It fell through the underground flame vein in a brief moment and fell into magma.

That region was terrifying. Many corpses were floating on the magma, but the golden statue was quietly seated in it. When a Buddhist mantra echoed, the corpses were released from their suffering, and a majestic scene appeared before Lin Yun. Multiple souls of ancient experts flew out from the ground. They had suffered for a long time and were finally released today.

This made Lin Yun widen his mouth because the Buddhist cult’s expert exorcised the dead even after his death. This filled him with respect for this expert, and he bowed, “Senior, I apologize for what I did earlier.”

He flapped the Golden Crow Wings and left after bowing. A long time later, he turned back. He didn’t know if it was his misperception, but he felt that the Buddha statue had raised its head and was looking at him even from a few thousand miles away.

“It won’t be another lingering will, right?” Lin Yun muttered before he retracted his gaze.

Three days later, Lin Yun opened his eyes and let out a breath on a snowy mountain. He had utterly refined the Golden Lotus over the past three days, and his cultivation had reached the pinnacle second-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. Aside from that, he was also more proficient at controlling the Golden Lotus Sacred Flames and the pagoda.

“Is there no one from the Sword Sect here as well?” Lin Yun furrowed his brows after taking out the medal. There was no reaction from it. But the Ancient Barren Battlefield was massive, and the scale was that of a few capitals. So it wasn’t weird that he didn’t run into anyone from the Sword Sect.

A black pillar of light soared to the sky and pierced through the demonic clouds. When the demonic clouds exploded, sunlight shone down. It looked like a golden pillar was descending from the sky. The mountain that was enveloped under the light shone, revealing all the buildings on the mountain. When the demonic clouds gathered again, the palaces swiftly disappeared.

“Ruins?” Lin Yun’s eyes lit up. Those were ancient ruins. Ordinary treasures, such as saint elixirs, weren’t rare on the Ancient Barren Battlefield and could be found everywhere. But there weren’t many complete ancient ruins.

As Lin Yun’s heart throbbed, flames began to blaze within his pupils. An ancient ruin was equivalent to ancient saint pellets, secret techniques, and ancient treasures. Saint elixirs were nothing compared to them because they would strengthen a sect’s foundation.

This was one of the reasons why the Profound Sky Sect could rise so quickly, and the other was Tian Xuanzi. Without a heaven-defying existence like Tian Xuanzi, the Profound Sky Sect wouldn’t be able to patch the incomplete ancient martial techniques so quickly.

“Let’s go!” Lin Yun didn’t hesitate to turn into a streak of light and charged over. When he got close, he realized that the region was covered in darkness. If it weren’t for the Dragon Pulse Realm experts being able to see through the darkness, he would be no different from a blind man in this region.

There was a majestic mountain before him that made humans look tiny in comparison.

“I should be in the right place.” Lin Yun muttered as he descended from the sky and sensed the saint aura coming from the mountain. If it weren’t for this aura, this mountain would be no different from a barren mountain. But this also meant that there must be an inheritance to release such pressure.

“What power!”

“Who’s that person? He’s only at the second-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, but his vitality is powerful.”

“Lin Yun!”

Lin Yun attracted much attention when he descended. He had no intention of hiding his cultivation when he flew over. His vitality was boiling and was even more potent than those at the pinnacle third-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. With such a robust vitality, he was like a light in the darkness, and his arrival naturally attracted many people’s attention.

“Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple, Flower Burial!”

“It’s him! He slaughtered nearly a hundred people from the Myriad Beast Gate by himself!”

“That fellow is a little arrogant.” Many gazes fell on Lin Yun, giving off the feeling that he had become a target. Amongst the gazes, many powerful auras far exceeded Lu Chen. This meant they were either the top geniuses of the powerful sects, experts from other domains, or demonic cultivators.

Lin Yun quietly circulated the Black Tortoise Breathing and changed his location multiple times. It didn’t take long for him to disappear within the crowd, and all the gazes on him also disappeared. This was because Lin Yun had learned his lesson from the Buddha statue, “I should be careful.”

He could sense that those people who came here weren’t only strong but also cautious, and most of them had fear lingering within their pupils. This was simple to understand. Everyone who came here was a disciple of the powerful sects.

The eight powerful sects paid more importance to ancient inheritances, which wasn’t something that saint elixirs could be compared to. After Lin Yun avoided the surrounding gazes, he climbed the mountain. This black mountain was mysterious, and he could only see a faint light. Along the way, he saw many damaged paths and mutilated corpses.

This meant that someone was a step ahead of him, and the structure of the mountain was complicated, like a maze. Those complete buildings were empty without anything valuable. So Lin Yun used his Heavenly Dome Sword Intent to briefly sense and realized that the saint aura came from the mountain summit, “The pressure is coming from the summit of the mountain!”

Not wasting any time, Lin Yun headed straight to the mountain summit. But the higher he went, the more terrifying the surrounding pressure became. There were even signs of battles in many palaces, but nothing was valuable. Lin Yun wished Lil’ Red was with him at times like this.

Lin Yun was unhappy because he couldn’t see anyone after climbing the mountain, not to mention any treasures. If Lil’ Red were here, it probably wouldn’t leave anything behind, based on its temperament.

Right then, a terrifying aura swept out from the mountain summit. The location he was standing in emitted a dazzling light that swept out from the mountain and was accompanied by a terrifyingly deadly aura. This made Lin Yun furrow his brow once more because it was this aura again, the aura that had broken through the demonic clouds earlier. But since he was too far away before, he didn’t detect the terrifyingly deadly aura.

This made him curious about this black mountain. It gave Lin Yun the feeling that it was a dead mountain. There was no sign of life in the surroundings and no bones of ancient experts. This was unlike the ancient inheritance that he expected.

He knew he had to reach the summit to find out what was wrong. Just like that, Lin Yun spent an hour flying before arriving at his destination, where the deadly aura exploded. There was a platform with a towering wall at the far end. The top of the wall was the summit of this mountain, and the wall had a layer of mist flowing down that made it look like a waterfall.

As for the origin of the black waterfall, it came from a sword plunged at the mountain summit. He instantly knew that the sword was a treasure. After all, for such a terrifyingly deadly aura to exist even after so many years have passed, even a fool could tell that the sword was an ancient treasure.

There were many damaged pillars on the platform, including collapsed palaces. The surroundings were filled with people who came from various forces. No one wanted to let anyone reach the summit, so a fight naturally took place. The deadly aura swept out earlier because the fight here was too intense.

Lin Yun hid within the darkness and raised his head to look at the sword. A few thousand feet wasn’t far, but the deadly aura was like a fog enveloping the sword. Thus, no one could catch a clear glimpse of that sword.

“Nether energy…” Lin Yun was greatly shocked. He wasn’t sure before, but he was sure now that the deadly aura was pure nether energy. The nether energy within this sword was a few hundred times above the Netherflower he refined in the past, so what did that mean? A Netherflower allowed him to reach the fifth stage in the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra, but this sword was sufficient for the entire Divine Firmament Peak.

The Divine Firmament Sword Sutra declined because the Nether Sea was destroyed, and it was hard to find nether energy in this world. But if he could bring this sword back to the Divine Firmament Peak, it would allow it to rise again. So Lin Yun was determined to obtain this sword, no matter what. One must know that the Divine Firmament Peak possessed one of the six strongest sword sutras in the Sword Sect.

Since the platform was spacious, there were many experts fighting. There were at least seven or eight at the fourth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, but they weren’t any stronger than Lu Chen.

Even so, Lin Yun decided to continue to watch. He was sure there must be experts on this mountain because his sense of danger from the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent wouldn’t lie to him. But no one showed up, even after half of the people on the platform had been killed.

Just when Lin Yun was starting to lose his patience, the golden human in his sword ocean trembled, and he could sense a wisp of fear. In the next second, a blade ray flew out. The blade ray was highly condensed, and countless scriptures were engraved on it.

Behind the blade ray was the illusion of a Buddha that lit up the entire platform. When that sword ray flew, aside from the few at the fourth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, everyone’s weapons and constellations were severed into two.

“The Demon Subduing Blade!” The few fourth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm geniuses’ faces changed because they immediately knew who it was. It had to be the Vajra Monastery’s Blade Wilder, Xuan Feng!Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m
