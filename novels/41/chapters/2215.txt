Chapter 2216: Dao Yang Is Also Depressed

.

“Hehe. Ye Qingtian, I mean, I should call you Flower Burial now. Thank you for your sword!” The Crane Fairy was happy when she saw Lin Yun and even took out the Heavenly Dipper Sword.

“I will definitely do what I promised,” Lin Yun smiled.

“Dao Yang, see that? See how generous he is, and you haven’t given me anything when you’ve promised me for years,” the Crane Fairy turned around and complained to the Dao Yang Holy Son.

The Dao Yang Holy Son scratched his head, and helplessly smiled, “Next time. Next time, for sure.”

“Hmph, as if I’ll believe you,” the Crane Fairy retorted.

“Did Senior Tian Xing say anything?” Lin Yun turned to look at the Crane Fairy.

The Crane Fairy sighed, “Master complained, saying that the Heavenly Dao Sect is always missing a sword. After all, the situation might have been different if he had the Emperor Sword back then. Maybe he couldn’t put it down.”

Lin Yun’s gaze also became dim because he had already done his best to retrieve the Emperor Sword, but the sword seemed a little afraid of him. He tried to reach for it multiple times, but it would retreat before he could even get close. Lin Yun muttered, “Perhaps I should give it a try.”

The Crane Fairy smiled, “Master just couldn’t let it go. He’s not someone who can’t accept a loss, and he knew that he wasn’t Yu Qingfeng’s opponent from a long time ago. The Emperor Sword was only a little comfort that he gave himself.”

“But the Heavenly Dao Sect still has to bring the Emperor Sword back,” the Dao Yang Holy Son said.

Lin Yun looked at the Dao Yang Holy Son. After that happened on the ninth, the Dao Yang Holy Son had matured.

The Dao Yang Holy Son stood up, looking at Lin Yun with a smile, “Let’s take a walk?”

“Sure,” Lin Yun nodded.

“I want to come along!” The Crane Fairy said, “Don’t even think about shaking me off.”

“Follow if you want,” Dao Yang Holy Son smiled. As he and Lin Yun began their stroll, they chatted while the Crane Fairy hopped while following them.

“It’s no wonder why you’re unwilling to become the holy son. I didn’t expect the famous Flower Burial Lin Yun to be beside me.” Dao Yang Holy Son looked at Lin Yun with a wink. He smiled, “You’ve acted too well, or is that your nature? Holy Maiden Killer?”

“More or less. How’s the situation within the Heavenly Dao Sect now?” Lin Yun asked with a smile. After the ninth, the chaos within the Heavenly Dao Sect was bound to spread throughout the Kunlun Realm. With the strongest holy land in the Eastern Desolation suffering a huge blow, chaos would soon appear within the Eastern Desolation.

“Chaotic.” The Dao Yang Holy Son sighed, “After that day, all the subsidiary forces of the Heavenly Dao Sect took a heavy blow, and the Heavenly Dao Sect could only shrink its forces. Some holy lands even wanted to probe the current state of the Heavenly Dao Sect, with the Ming Cult and Myriad Thunder Sect being the most active. Even the demonic forces have joined in.

“The entire Eastern Desolation is chaotic, and the God Burial Mountain Range seal has loosened once more. Not long from now, even Saints will bea allowed to freely enter and leave the God Burial Mountain Range. Six Holy City no longer exists. There are rumors that a deity’s corpse had appeared, and everyone is trying to find out if it’s true.”

“A deity’s corpse?” Lin Yun asked.

“Yeah,” the Dao Yang Holy Son replied. “When the emperor’s inheritance appeared, someone sensed something similar to the deity’s corpse, which sparked chaos.”

Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts because he knew their were deities who had died in the God Burial Mountain Range before the ancient battle. This was where the God Burial Mountain Range got its name from.

“The God Burial Mountain Range is mysterious, and there were many holy lands there in ancient times. Although there are a lot of opportunities, there are also many forbidden grounds. So loosening the seal this time will probably cause a huge effect,” the Dao Yang Holy Son said.

“Any news on the Blood Moon Sect?” Lin Yun asked.

“They’ve disappeared,” the Dao Yang Holy Son said. “The Ninth Princess of the Profound Imperial Palace is destroying the branches of the Blood Moon Sect. I heard she even wanted to kill her way to the God Burial Mountain Range and find the Blood Moon Sect’s base. The Divine Dragon Empire is probably furious this time.”

As the two chatted, thee Dao Yang Holy Son looked at Lin Yun. He smiled, “Why don’t we fight? Let me see the gap between us.”

“Do we really have to fight?” Lin Yun asked after a brief stun.

“Who wouldn’t want to spar with Flower Burial?” The Dao Yang Holy Son smiled as fighting spirits blazed in his eyes. He continued, “I had reservations during the Blue Dragon Record, and you probably haven’t grasped Sword Dao yet. So I won’t lose terribly if I fight you now.”

After seeing how Lin Yun slew four Saint Lords, the Dao Yang Holy Son didn’t have much hope of beating Lin Yun. Although Lin Yun had used a Sovereign Saint Artifact and half a Sovereign Divine Rune, the Dao Yang Holy Son knew he couldn’t accomplish Lin Yun’s feats if he was in Lin Yun’s position. Even if he had a Sovereign Saint Artifact, he might not have even been able to deal with the Horizon Hawk Saint Lord, not to mention four Saint Lords all together. If they fought, it would be the same as delivering a Sovereign Saint Artifact to his enemy.

“Let’s fight, then.” Lin Yun no longer refused.

“You have to become serious, or you might lose terribly,” the Dao Yang Holy Son smiled, and he approached Lin Yun. Without any hesitation, he threw his punch at Lin Yun.

When the punch reached Lin Yun, the Dao Yang Holy Son’s body turned into a blazing sun with golden flames lighting up the horizon with a terrifying temperature spreading out. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

But that wasn’t all. The aura the Dao Yang Holy Son released continued to rise, soon reaching the Sacred Flame Stage and the thirty-six layers of heavenly screens combined with the Great Sun Saint Physique. Just when Lin Yun was about to reach his limit, the aura released by the Dao Yang Holy Son continued to climb, breaking through the shackles and reaching the second stage of the Heavenly Origin Phase, the Saint Soul Stage.

This shocked Lin Yun, but he soon recollected himself. After all, the Thousand Plume Great Saint gave him many resources before the ninth, and the Dao Yang Holy Son would only receive more as a holy son. This meant that the Dao Yang Holy Son couldn’t be underestimated.

Lin Yun was sent a hundred meters away as the two punches collided. He exclaimed, “What a powerful cultivation!”

“It’s alright. But you haven’t gotten serious yet since you haven’t drawn your sword!” The Dao Yang Holy Son laughed as he dashed over.

Lin Yun flicked his finger, circulating the Great Profound Sword Canon and multiple sharp sword rays flew out with the Golden Firmament Sword appearing. But when the sword rays landed on the Dao Yang Holy Son, it only produced a series of collisions.

“Great Profound Sword Array!” Lin Yun clasped his hands together and three mountains rose behind him. When he pushed his palms forth, hundreds of sword rays flew out. But that wasn’t all, Lin Yun released his Astral Sword Intent with a sun and a moon rising to the sky.

“Hahaha! Blazing Cauldron!” the Dao Yang Holy Son roared as his body started burning like a cauldron. As multiple punches descended, the golden meteorites devoured all the sword rays.

“Great Sun Aura!” The Dao Yang Holy Son charged over as his blood began to boil. His eyes shone brightly as ancient runes began to form into a layer of dipper aura on his body.

This naturally shocked Lin Yun. The dipper aura might not be stronger than a Saint Lord’s, but it seemed even more mysterious since it was unique to the Great Sun Saint Physique.

“Azure Dragon Divine Physique!” Lin Yun didn’t dare to be careless and brought out the Azure Dragon Divine Physique. They exchanged over a hundred moves in the blink of an eye, and their battle left the Crane Fairy shocked because Lin Yun and the Dao Yang Holy Son’s afterimages could be seen everywhere in the valley from their speed.

One possessed the natal Great Sun Saint Physique, while the other possessed an acquired Azure Dragon Divine Physique at lesser mastery. When the two punches collided, Lin Yun wanted to hold back, but the Dragon’s Blood within his body felt like it had found an opponent on the same level and it became even more excited, so Lin Yun was shocked because he couldn’t restrain it.

Furthermore, Lin Yun discovered that his sword aura was slowly disappearing during the confrontation.

“Devour Dao?” Lin Yun soon came to his senses. The Dao Yang Holy Son grasped the Heavenly Devour Saint Canon and had long grasped Devour Dao. This was an actual Sovereign Dao.

“Flower Burial, it’s too late for you to discover it now. Devour!” The Dao Yang Holy Son laughed as he released his Devour Dao, and his body was like a bottomless abyss. This was shocking because the Dao Yang Holy Son had split his attention into two, weakening Lin Yun’s sword aura while increasing the power of his attacks.

As Lin Yun groaned, he was sent flying back and fell onto the ground with one hand. But before he could raise his head, a blazing wind blew over. He tried his best to dodge it, but he was still sent flying away by the shockwave. This instantly put Lin Yun in a dangerous position on a raft in the ocean, swaying around at risk of toppling over.

After another punch, Lin Yun’s sword aura was completely devoured as the sun and moon's sword stars dimmed. He looked pathetic with his clothes tattered and his face paled.

“You can have it back!” The Dao Yang Holy Son became excited when he saw this and returned the devoured sword aura, and even the two sword stars began to shine above. This was a magical feeling because this was the first time Lin Yun faced something like this, and his scalp became numb while facing this punch that was enveloped in such strong Astral Sword Intent that even his heart skipped a beat. He had never felt his life being threatened like this before.

If it was someone else facing the Astral Sword Intent, they would definitely feel suffocating since it was too dangerous.

“How troublesome.” Lin Yun took a few steps back before he turned around with the Flower Burial Sword in his hand and faced the Dao Yang Holy Son again. When he drew his sword, his devoured sword intent bloomed from a sword ray that destroyed everything before it: the golden flames, the devoured Astral Sword Intent, and the ancient dipper aura.

The Dao Yang Holy Son threw out a mouthful of blood as he retreated, his face becoming pale. He held the upper hand a moment ago but was covered in blood the next. He had no idea what just happened and could only see a sword ray. The sword ray wasn’t particularly dazzling since the light was weak, like lights produced by fireflies. But when the sword ray came, it destroyed everything in its path.

“Are you alright?” Lin Yun rushed over after sheathing his sword.

The Dao Yang Holy Son wore a complicated expression, and he looked at Lin Yun with resentment, “You’re not allowed to use your sword in the future if we fight.”

After all, he was defeated with one sword.
