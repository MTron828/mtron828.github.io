Chapter 663 - Disagreement

Very quickly, Lin Yun, Xiang Tianhe, and Qing Ruoyou were the only ones left. Qing Ruoyou sat back down with a serene look on her face. However, she had anything but an ordinary air about her. In fact, it looked like she was shrouded in a faint moon essence that made her look ethereal.

Yang Fan said that she was known as the Indigomoon Elysium’s princess by the geniuses of the Thunder Prefecture. It made sense since she had an outstanding temperament and beauty.

But Lin Yun has seen many beauties in the past. Whether it was the charming Xin Yan, the bewitching Yue Weiwei, or the radiating Su Ziyao, any one of these beauties could surpass Qing Ruoyou. Maintaining his composure, Lin Yun asked, “Is there anything you need?”

Lin Yun’s indifferent voice made Xiang Tianhe lock his brows together because he couldn’t sense any respect from Lin Yun.

Qing Ruoyou placed her cup down and said, “The mark on your forehead looks familiar.”

Lin Yun looked at Qing Ruoyou without giving her a reply. Then, Qing Ruoyou smiled as she continued, “The mark I’m talking about comes from the Sword Sect. After the Sword Sect was annihilated, the Ancient Southern Domain had several sects that inherited this mark. Coincidentally, my Indigomoon Elysium also has the same tradition.”

Qing Ruoyou’s tone made Lin Yun feel somewhat uncomfortable. It felt as though she was superior to him and he had no idea what she was trying to say. Since she could recognize his sword slave mark, then there was no need to beat around the bush.

He wasn’t bothered by his mark, but he had no idea what Qing Ruoyou was trying to say with her aloof attitude.

“I have other matters that brought me to Skymound City, but what Xiang Tianhe said earlier wasn’t wrong. If there are geniuses that can attract my attention, I can invite them into the Indigomoon Elysium and they can take an elder as their master,” said Qing Ruoyou as she looked at Lin Yun. Sipping on her wine, she waited for Lin Yun to come up and express his gratitude.

“Lin Yun, you’re really lucky. The Indigomoon Elysium has seven elders, all of whom are Heavenly Soul Realm elders in the seventh soul stage,” smiled Xiang Tianhe.

“I’m sorry, but I come from the Great Qin Empire’s Sword Firmament Pavilion. I have no intention of changing my sect. Thank you for your goodwill,” said Lin Yun as he turned around and left.

Qing Ruoyou slammed her cup on the ground with disgust flashing in her pupils.

Xiang Tianhe cursed inwardly and quickly spoke to Qing Ruoyou, “This fellow really doesn’t know what’s good for him. Ruoyou, you don’t have to lower yourself to his position.”

“He’s just a sword slave,” said Qing Ruoyou. “No need to bother with him. Someone like him can barely catch my attention. If he isn’t willing to join the Indigomoon Elysium, then he is no different from an ant.”

Her tone was indifferent, but the chill in her tone made Xiang Tianhe nervous because he knew that Qing Ruoyou was truly enraged. But the reason why she didn’t teach Lin Yun a move was due to her identity.

Then again, it made sense with Qing Ruoyou’s identity. Not only was she beautiful, but she could stand pridefully in the Ancient Southern Domain with her strength. As for her beauty, in the entire Ancient Southern Domain, she stood above many people. This wasn’t something limited to Skymound City.

So it was natural for her to be somewhat furious since she went out of her way for a sword slave. As for why she tried to recruit Lin Yun, Xiang Tianhe could roughly guess why. The Dragoncloud Ranking might be a dazzling ranking to an ordinary person, but geniuses like them knew that the Dragoncloud Ranking meant the Dragon Fortune. The Draconic Banquet was just half a year away, so all the various overlord sects had started recruiting geniuses to compete for the Ancient Southern Domain’s fortune.

Qing Ruoyou was one of the Indigomoon Elysium’s icons, so she naturally had to consider the sect. Furthermore, she would also benefit from herrecruits.

However, she was simply too arrogant. Even if she wanted to recruit Lin Yun, she only gave him a hint of what she was doing and it was clear that she didn’t want to lower herself. If it was someone else in Lin Yun’s position, they would definitely get down on their knees to express their gratitude. But it was a pity that Lin Yun wasn’t interested. The princess of the Indigomoon Elysium? The four beauties of the Thunder Prefecture? What did it have to do with him?

“Let’s talk about some proper business, Xiang Tianhe,” said Qing Ruoyou. To her, Lin Yun’s matter was just an insignificant matter.

“The Skymound City’s auction will be held seven days from now. I have received accurate information that the Divine Indigo Radiantstone will appear,” said Xiang Tianhe.

“The Divine Indigo Radiantstone?” Qing Ruoyou’s eyes flickered as she continued, “That’s impossible. If the Divine Indigo Radiantstone was going to appear, the Indigomoon Elysium would definitely receive the news. It’s impossible that I don’t know about it.”

Xiang Tianhe smiled, “This is my capability. But since you can hear about this, others from the Indigomoon Elysium will also know about it.”

Qing Ruoyou examined Xiang Tianhe and she instantly knew what he meant. Clearly, Xiang Tianhe had suppressed this news and only told her about it. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Thank you. I’ll remember this favor,” said Qing Ruoyou.

When Xiang Tianhe heard those words, his heart sped up as he said, “It’s just a small matter.”

Although he knew that this small favor wouldn’t win Qing Ruoyou’s heart, he did it willingly for Qing Ruoyou because of his admiration for her. Then again, there were many people in the Thunder Prefecture like him, so it wasn’t surprising.

“I’ve heard of the Skymound City auction. From what I’ve heard, this auction is different from others. There’s also a saying that it’s called the Death Auction…” Qing Ruoyou said without any expression on her face.

Xiang Tianhe smiled, “Indeed, everyone is required to sign the Life-Death Agreement. But calling it the Death Auction is a little too dramatic. It’s just that the auction is a little extreme. But no one in Skymound City will compete with you. The Divine Indigo Radiantstone will definitely be yours.”

Qing Ruoyou didn’t reply, but her eyes began to flicker as she was clearly determined to obtain the Divine Indigo Radiantstone. The Indigomoon Elysium’s Indigomoon Sutra was renown in the Ancient Southern Domain as an earth grade cultivation technique. According to legend, it was comparable to a heavenly grade cultivation technique with its ability to summon the indigomoon and to bring forth colors from heaven and earth.

But this cultivation technique was too cold, so it was unavoidable for one to be infected with a chill poison when they reached a high stage. Upon reaching that stage, they would either slow down in their cultivation to refine the poison or find a treasure to dispel the chill poison.

The Divine Indigo Radiantstone was one of the top-tiered treasures. Not only could it dispel the chill poison, but it could also convert the chill poison into indigomoon origin energy to push the cultivation to a new stage. So the appearance of every Divine Indigo Radiantstone would definitely attract the attention of Indigomoon Elysium’s geniuses and elders.

Outside the courtyard, Lin Yun saw Yang Fan and Guo Xu waiting for him. He could tell that they were very curious as to why Qing Ruoyou called for him. After all, Qing Ruoyou was a legendary figure in the Thunder Prefecture and her appearances caused huge commotions. They could expect that it wouldn’t take long for the entire Skymound City to know about her arrival.

If a lady had beauty or strength, they would be popular. As for Qing Ruoyou, she had both, which signified why she was so popular.

Looking at the curiosity on Yang Fan and Guo Xu’s faces, Lin Yun smiled. His meeting with Qing Ruoyou wasn’t exactly good. In fact, it was more of an unpleasant meeting. So it wasn’t really a good thing to talk about, especially since these two were captivated by her.

Guo Xu smiled, “Hehe, looks like it’s a secret. This aside, you can stay in the Skymound City for a few days if you have nothing to do. There will be an auction seven days from now that you might be interested in.”

“This auction is somewhat special, so we’re intending to take a look,” said Yang Fan.

Auction? Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts. He had participated in many auctions, but they were more or less the same.

“Are you telling me that this auction isn’t one where the highest bid wins?” joked Lin Yun.

“Yeah, it’s not.” Yang Fan smiled mysteriously.
