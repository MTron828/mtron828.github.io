Chapter 1028 - Invincible Sky Sword Intent

“Die!” The Nether Divinity War Realm’s head general was the first to charge over. He was donned in white clothes with a purple ancient tablet in his hand. As origin energy surged out from his palm, the mysterious ancient tablet was activated while mysterious runes flew out like a spear. It was an attack left behind by a deceased expert from the tablet.

“You want to kill me with just this much?” Lin Yun sneered. His fist began to glow with a golden crow as he punched the ancient spear. Immediately, Lin Yun noticed something unusual about the ancient table. There was a terrifying aura surging out of the tablet.

Then, a transparent gigantic figure appeared out of the ancient tablet, holding onto an ancient spear. The appearance of the figure caused the surrounding space to distort. At this moment, the power within the ancient tablet was completely activated.

The crowd watched as the spear pierced Lin Yun’s punch, causing the ground to tremble violently. Instantly, Lin Yun’s face changed because he was facing a powerful treasure that made him feel a bit of fear.

However, that didn’t stop Lin Yun. He quickly responded with a barrier formed by a golden winged human. It was the first time that Lin Yun had ever defended so seriously. Clearly, the origin of the ancient tablet was extraordinary.

“I see! There are many ancient souls sealed in the tablet, which is why the Nether Divinity Realm Son was able to exit a forbidden region!” The crowd clamored when they realized the power of the tablet. Since the souls sealed in the tablet helped the Nether Divinity Realm Son leave a forbidden region, the tablet had to have a huge origin.

As golden light surged, golden crows began to charge out of Lin Yun’s barrier. The golden crows quickly turned into bright suns and lit up the surrounding region. As of this moment, Lin Yun’s Divine Glorysun Fist was circulating at its limit.

Simultaneously, the Profound Dragon War Realm’s head general also made his move. Waving the banner in his hand, he turned the region before him into a sea of flames. From within the sea of flames, a youth donned in dragon armor appeared. The youth was also a soul who emitted a domineering aura.

The crowd started to marvel at the foundation of the war realms. “That’s the treasure used by the Profound Dragon Realm Son. It manifested the Profound Dragon Ancestor’s younger appearance. Incredible, it’s not a remnant soul but a heroic spirit!”

Every war realm had at least one supreme expert. A supreme expert was an invincible existence of an era. Naturally, their heroic spirit had a lot of power.

“How terrifying.” Lin Yun was surprised by the foundation of the war realms. As the armored youth wielded the banner, he emitted a powerful aura. Luckily for Lin Yun, the youth was a much younger version of the Profound Dragon Ancestor. Even if the Profound Dragon Ancestor was invincible, that didn’t mean the younger version was also invincible.

Lin Yun threw out a punch as thousands of golden crows flew out. It was an attack that surpassed the Nine Annihilating Suns. Everlasting Sunlight!

With that, Lin Yun managed to face the strongest attack of the heroic spirit head-on.

“Dragon Capturing Claw!” The Elysium Trigram War Realm’s head general made a move and a ball of flames exploded. Then, a gigantic claw tore through the golden crows.

Just like that, the golden crows began to perish without facing any resistance. The two other head generals followed closely behind as their phenomena charged at Lin Yun.

“The treasures of the Realm Sons were bestowed upon them by their clans. How terrifying! Lin Yun is in big trouble.” Lin Yun was instantly enveloped in a terrifying light that made everyone worried. Everyone was concerned for Lin Yun with unwillingness in their eyes.

Right at this moment, a sword hum echoed out as countless sword rays soared into the sky. Lin Yun was bringing out his sky sword intent at complete mastery for the first time. As Lin Yun released a furious roar, the face of the white-clothed youth from the Nether Divinity War Realm turned pale.

The youth’s figure tottered as he nearly fell off the altar. The spectators couldn’t believe that the preparation of the Realm Sons wasn’t enough to deal with Lin Yun.

“Sky sword intent!” The white-clothed youth’s eyes flashed with hatred as he spit up blood. Then, he charged forward once more with the ancient tablet in his hand.

Facing three head generals, Lin Yun was forced to bring out his full strength. He couldn’t afford to hold back anymore because the treasures of the Realm Sons were too strong in the hands of the head generals. After all, the treasures were strong enough to suppress the crowd, not to mention Lin Yun. As of this moment, the crowd had a much better understanding of the Realm Sons. They couldn’t imagine how terrifyingly strong the treasures would be in the hands of the Realm Sons.

Empowering himself with the sky sword intent, Lin Yun began to emit a golden glow that suppressed the light of the war realm treasures. Even if the War Realms were strong and the treasures they had were powerful, they weren’t enough to make Lin Yun sweat.

Now, the soul from the stone tablet could no longer pierce Lin Yun’s origin energy. Additionally, the heroic soul from the banner could no longer block his attack. Best of all, the beast claw was damaged by his attack. “H-how is this possible?!”

With a push of his palm, Lin Yun shattered the phenomena of the head generals and sent them flying. As all three collided with the statue, they stared at Lin Yun with fear. After all, they were using the treasures of the Realm Sons. Even though they couldn’t unleash the full power of the treasures, it made no sense that they were being suppressed.

“That fellow is a monster!” The Nether Divinity War Realm’s youth yelled, “No wonder he’s from the same realm as that woman!” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Lin Yun’s face changed when he heard that, “Yue Weiwei?”

“Haha, it sounds like you guys have a pretty good relationship. She’s not your lover, right?” said the white-clothed youth with a smile.

When Lin Yun heard that, his face sank, “What information do you have on her? Speak and I might spare your life!”

The white-clothed youth smiled, “Spare my life? You have no idea that you’re already facing death, do you? The Realm Sons issued orders to kill you if we can’t capture you. No matter, you’re going to die either way..”

“Brat, you can die relieved. We’ll take care of Yue Weiwei on your behalf. After you die, your Azure Dragon True Bone will shine brightly in the hands of the Realm Sons,” smiled the Elysium Trigram War Realm’s youth.

He was provoking Lin Yun on purpose because it was satisfying to watch the latter get angry. After all, the head generals had lost, so they had to repay the humiliation. Unfortunately for them, they didn’t realize who they were offending.

“What a shame, Flower Burial. There’s nothing you can do to change your outcome,” smiled the Profound Dragon War Realm’s head general.

“Kill him!” Roared the Nether Divinity War Realm’s head general. The Beast Soul Pearls exploded and ancient beasts began to appear. The sheer size of the beasts turned the sky dark as they locked onto Lin Yun.

“The Ancient Demon Seal Array is active!” The spectators trembled as fear loomed over their hearts. Then, the three head generals returned to the statue, smiling at Lin Yun with brutality in their eyes.
