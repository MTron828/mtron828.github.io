Chapter 867 - Flamecloud Incinerating Palm

The map in Fang Shaoyu’s hands made many people feel relieved about his leadership. As they travelled, they could sense the demonic aura hidden in the clouds. No one knew what would happen at night and they didn’t want to take any risks.

At this moment, Yue Weiwei looked like she had something to say. Lin Yun stopped because he was prepared for this. After all, she was from Kunlun Realm. If she didn’t have her own secrets, she wouldn’t have risked coming to the Profound Amber Realm. Back in the Profound Amber Realm, Lin Yun could sense that Yue Weiwei was searching for something among the countless realms. Perhaps she wanted to continue her search.

“Big Brother Yun, I’ll be making a move,” smiled Yue Weiwei with reluctance in her eyes.

“I’ll come with you,” said Lin Yun.

“Hehe. Big Brother Yun, you’re really good to me. The place I’m going to doesn't have an inheritance,” said Yue Weiwei. “My seal has loosened up now that we are in the Heavenly Path, so even you might not be able to beat me.”

Lin Yun was silent as his eyes shined bright. All of a sudden, he pushed a palm towards Yue Weiwei.

Yue Weiwei smiled as she pushed her hand out at Lin Yun. Her movement seemed slow, but her palm moved even faster than lightning, which pushed Lin Yun back three steps before he could stabilize himself. However, Yue Weiwei didn’t keep moving as her hair draped over her shoulders like a waterfall.

Lin Yun’s eyes flickered and fell into deep thoughts. He had used 50% of his strength in his palm. Although he didn’t bring out his sword, his attack was unexpected. However, Yue Weiwei still blocked it. At the very least, he was sure that Yue Weiwei wasn’t weaker than him anymore.

Lin Yun didn’t force the issue and said, “I’m willing to listen to you. If anyone stands against you in the Heavenly Path, they will also be my opponent!”

There weren't many feelings in his words, but Lin Yun was clearly full of determination. His words made Yue Weiwei’s heart throb. Could it be that Lin Yun guessed something and could tell that she didn’t want to implicate him?

Yue Weiwei smiled, “Big Brother Yun, take care of yourself. The competition will start at the end of Heavenly Path one year from now. You have to reach the second soul of Heavenly Soul Realm at the very least or else you won’t be able to stand out in the competition.”

“Take care of yourself,” replied Lin Yun.

“Hehe. Remember what you promised me, little one.” Yue Weiwei teased Lil’ Red briefly before she left. Before she disappeared, she turned around to smile at Lin Yun. Then, she disappeared into the horizon.

Lin Yun took a deep breath. He could feel the anxiety in Yue Weiwei’s words. It was clearly better for him to travel by himself. If he travelled with Fang Shaoyu’s group, they would only drag him down. However, he had to wait till they settled down before leaving.

Fifteen minutes later, Lin Yun caught up to the group.

“Lin Yun, where’s Yue Weiwei?” Fang Shaoyu asked. The others were also surprised because Lin Yun actually caught up to them.

“She left,” said Lin Yun indifferently.

Fang Shaoyu frowned before speaking in a commanding tone,” Lin Yun, it’s best for you to stop being so arrogant if you want to follow us. Otherwise, you can’t blame us for not helping you when you get into trouble.”

“Yeah, yeah. You’re right,” smiled Lin Yun.

Lin Yun’s words enraged Fang Shaoyu, but the group continued their journey and travelled through the barren lands. When the sky turned dark, everyone could see the outline of a city. The city was far away, but everyone’s eyes lit up because their journey was very convenient with the map.

An hour later, they finally arrived in front of the city. Technically, the city was a large town with high walls. At this moment, many cultivators were approaching the city. When the Profound Amber Realm party got near, they realized that they were blocked from entering.

“I’ll go take a look,” said Fang Shaoyu.

When Lin Yun raised his head, he saw a group of people on the walls wearing the same clothes. They all wore crimson robes with flaming flowers embedded on their clothes. Behind them were others that were wearing different clothes. Clearly, they were from different realms.

When Fang Shaoyu returned, his face was ugly. “This place has been occupied by the Flamecloud Realm. Anyone who wants to enter will have to pay 30 astral pellets. Otherwise…”

“Otherwise what?” Zhu Qingshan asked.

“You guys should know the rules by now. I won’t repeat them again. Don’t blame me for being ruthless if you guys don’t comply.” A youth donned in crimson clothes spoke from the city wall as he emitted a powerful aura. The youth's name was Tang Yan and he was a Heavenly Soul Realm expert. His origin energy was a lot stronger than Fang Shaoyu and Yu Haotian.

When it came to Heavenly Soul Realms, Yu Haotian was a lot weaker than others. Clearly, there was a huge difference between his foundation and everyone else’s.

“Hmph, no one owns this place. All that matters is strength. Who the hell do you think you are?!” Someone sneered the moment the youth finished talking and charged at the wall. But just when that person landed on the city wall, a flaming figure appeared.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Flamecloud Incinerating Palm!” A crimson bolt of lightning landed on the newcomer’s chest. With a scream, the newcomer’s chest was burned as flames spread across his body, killing him in an instant. When the corpse landed on the ground, it created a wall of fire that spread into the surroundings.

“Greater fortune martial technique!” Many people became nervous when they saw this scene. After all, the horrifying attack left no traces of flesh. Possessing a fortune martial technique was impressive enough, not to mention that the Flamecloud Realm’s fortune martial technique was terrifyingly powerful. At this moment, it was clear why the Flamecloud Realm was able to occupy the city.

Lin Yun narrowed his eyes because the Flamecloud Realm’s greater fortune martial technique was just as strong as his Azure Firmament Sword Sutra. Then again, when combining the Azure Firmament Sword Sutra with his Azure Firmament Thirteen Sword, the Flamecloud Incinerating Palm was nothing in comparison. Tang Yan didn’t even cultivate the Flamecloud Incinerating Palm to a high realm.

The Heavenly Path was truly a place with hidden dragons and crouching tigers. Fang Shaoyu and Zhao Chen were shocked because they realized that Tang Chen could easily kill them. Meanwhile, Yu Haotian’s eyes were also flickering with shock.

Seeing that he managed to intimidate everyone, Tang Yan had a smug look in his eyes, “Don’t say that I’m unreasonable. You guys can choose not to enter the city. At night, the demonic aura will descend and many demonic beasts will appear. Without the Dracophant Guardian, you guys won’t last long.”

With night arrived, everyone sensed the demonic aura in the atmosphere rising. They could also see countless glowing pairs of eyes in the darkness, which enveloped their hearts in fear. Thirty astral pellets might be a lot, but it was nothing compared to their lives.

“Let’s enter the city first,” said Fang Shaoyu in a sullen tone. “Let’s bear with it for now. We have one year. As long as we can find enough opportunities, we can become stronger and deal with them later.”

Lin Yun laughed inwardly because Fang Shaoyu was really naive. Fang Shaoyu actually wanted to bear with that treatment for a year? How was it any different than bowing to them? Furthermore, did Fang Shaoyu really think that they would have peace in the city after paying 30 astral pellets?

Like a venomous viper, Tang Yan stood on the wall and watched everyone hand over their astral pellets. Those that stood next to him also smiled as if they were looking at prey.

“The Flamecloud Incinerating Palm isn’t compatible with my cultivation technique, but its lethality is really strong…” Lin Yun followed the crowd. If he wanted to turn someone into ashes, it would be impossible without using his sword intent. But Tang Yan could do it without reaching lesser mastery in the Flamecloud Incinerating Palm.
