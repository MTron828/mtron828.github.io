Chapter 1534 - Maneuver Word Art, Dragon Locking Shackles

Lin Yun’s gaze fell onto the top hundredths after a brief pondering. This name should be the name of a woman, Bai Liuying, from the Eastern Desolation’s Heavenly Dao Sect. With a gentle tap on the name, Bai Liuying’s information appeared before him.

No one who managed to reach the top hundredths was weak; they would either be old monsters or absolute geniuses. Bai Liuying was a core disciple of the Heavenly Dao Sect’s nine peaks. She came from an Ancient Saint Clan and was a top-tiered genius within the Ancient Bai Saint Clan. She reached the pinnacle of the Empyrean Realm at the age of thirteen and reached the Elysium Core Realm at the age of fourteen. At the age of eighteen, she reached the Heavenly Elysium Core Realm.

Now that she was twenty-one, she reached the nine-star heavenly Elysium Core Realm, ranked 100 on the Elysium Core Ranking. Lin Yun nodded his head because this was a good opponent. Her young age and cultivation proved that she was a monstrous genius, no matter how he looked at it. But thinking about it, the Heavenly Dao Sect seemed to be a holy land.

“When was the last time she challenged the Elysium Core Ranking?” Lin Yun asked.

“Two years ago.”

“This is her strength from two years ago?”

“Yeah. She’s now on the Dragon Pulse Ranking.” This meant that no one could defeat her in the past two years, which gave Lin Yun some pressure.

“Looks like I can’t look down on anyone in the Eastern Desolation!” Lin Yun inwardly sighed. Having the Blue Dragon Bone didn’t mean that he was invincible. But this sparked his fighting spirit even further, and he felt he made the right choice coming here. After Lin Yun picked his opponent, it didn’t take long for the dragon spirit to transform into Bai Liuying.

“Someone picked me?” Bai Liuying’s voice resounded. When Lin Yun raised his head, he could see a heroic beauty wielding a longsword.

Despite knowing this was only a spiritual clone, Lin Yun still introduced himself according to his habit, “Sword Sect’s Lin Yun.”

“Let’s begin, then!” Bai Liuying didn’t waste time with Lin Yun and charged over with her sword, executing an intermediate-grade ghost spirit sword technique. A low-grade ghost spirit sword technique was terrifying enough, and the intermediate grade was on a new level.

Generally speaking, practicing a low-grade ghost spirit sword technique at the Elysium Core Realm was hard. A terrifying chill swept out when she drew her sword, instantly covering the hall in snowflakes. But if one looked at it carefully, the snowflakes were yin-attributed flames, and each snowflake was engraved with a saint rune.

A combination of Frost and Flame Intent, and she was also a spiritualist at the same time. This surprised Lin Yun, since this was the first time he had seen such means. Merging the dao of spiritual runes with a sword technique proved that her comprehension was a little terrifying.

If he didn’t have the Blue Dragon Bone and his sword intent didn’t reach quasi-fifth grade, he might not even be able to block a single sword from her. Lin Yun also drew his sword and thirty-six sword rays overlapped, forming an ancient ‘heaven’ word.

When Bai Liuying’s sword stabbed the ancient ‘heaven’ word, her sword slowed down, and fine cracks also appeared on the ‘heaven’ word. Her sword ultimately pierced through the word and slowly expanded within Lin Yun’s eyes.

“You lost!” Bai Liuying’s voice resounded as the power of her sword nearly tore this word apart.

“You’re overthinking it.” Lin Yun gently flicked his finger and unleashed the Flicking Divine Finger. As a dazzling sword ray flew out from Lin Yun’s finger, the sword ray looked like an erupting volcano.

Although Bai Liuying swiftly reacted by retreating, Lin Yun took a step forth, and the ancient ‘heaven’ word flew out. This made Bai Liuying helpless, and she could only raise her sword before her to block this attack. Even so, the impact of this attack knocked her to the wall.

“Interesting!” Bai Liuying’s gaze became grave as she looked at Lin Yun.

“It’s just a little trick.” Lin Yun swiped with his sword, and the ancient ‘heaven’ word scattered. As he continued to swing his sword, the strokes began to emit a terrifying aura that could restrict an entire space.

In the next second, Lin Yun executed the Divine Sunchasing Art and disappeared from where he stood. When he executed the Earth Sword Form, Bai Liuying suddenly slowed down. But that wasn’t lethal because she soon noticed the peculiarity of the Earth Sword Form.

She instantly felt like she was in a quicksand with her movement technique greatly restricted, and it didn’t take long for her to be covered in faint wounds. The way she was using her astral energy to protect herself was terrifying, and she could avoid most fatal attacks. She might look pathetic, but she didn’t suffer any severe injuries.

When Lin Yun was done executing the Earth Sword Form, the ‘heaven’ and ‘earth’ words began to revolve around the Flower Burial Sword. The surrounding space became distorted, and Bai Liuying finally couldn’t maintain her composure any longer.

The Flower Burial Sword found the right opportunity and wanted to sever her from her waist. When she saw Lin Yun wouldn’t let her go, Bai Liuying created a painting with her left hand forming a seal and a saint rune formed into a saint diagram.

When a snow lotus constructed with saint runes appeared, flames exploded from the heart of the lotus and blocked Lin Yun’s sword. When the lotus shattered, Bai Liuying took this opportunity to execute a profound movement technique. As she moved, she dissolved into petals and her physical form appeared outside the envelopment of the ‘heaven’ and ‘earth’ words.

“What a profound sword technique. I’ve never seen many people whose talent in the sword path can be compared to you.” Bai Liuying’s eyes flashed with appreciation as she looked at Lin Yun. Considering her identity, this was a high evaluation, and one could imagine how terrifying Lin Yun’s talent in the sword path was from her praise.

“Your movement technique is a little weird. It looks like a high-grade ghost spirit martial technique.” Lin Yun said.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Not bad, but I can barely execute this movement technique. I can only grasp it after reaching the Dragon Pulse Realm. This is the Maneuver Word Art of the Heavenly Dao Sect. The profundity of this movement technique lies in the fact that it can perfectly merge with the cultivator’s martial dao.” Since Bai Liuying thought highly of Lin Yun’s talent, she didn’t hesitate to share the secrets of this movement technique.

But appreciation was appreciation. She no longer held back when she regulated her breathing and they clashed again. But all of Lin Yun’s attacks were avoided by Bai Liuying’s Maneuver Word Art. A high-grade ghost spirit martial technique was simply a cheat in a fight between Elysium Core Realm experts.

When Lin Yun’s attack missed again, several petals drifted in the air, and Bai Liuying disappeared. But this time, Lin Yun had no intention of letting her go and summoned the Golden Crow Wings. Twenty thousand saint runes on the Golden Crow Wings lit up with a single thought.

Flapping the wings, boundless energy exploded, and Bai Liuying’s footing became uneasy when she reappeared. As a cold light flashed across Lin Yun’s pupils, he arrived before her, and his sword knocked Bai Liuying’s sword away.

Seeing that Lin Yun’s sword was about to stab her forehead, Bai Liuying twisted her figure and used two fingers to clasp onto it. When Lin Yun tried to exert more force, he was shocked to discover saint runes flowing from her fingers to the Flower Burial Sword, and he realized that he couldn’t break free from her at all.

“Not good!” An ill premonition suddenly alarmed Lin Yun, and he wanted to let go of his sword.

“You’re too late!” Bai Liuying wore a cunning smile as she began to form seals and roared, “Seal!”

The saint runes flowed from the Flower Burial Sword to Lin Yun and formed into shackles that sealed off his astral energy ocean. This meant that Lin Yun’s cultivation was instantly restricted.

“You lost.” Beads of sweat flowed down from Bai Liuying’s forehead. But she also breathed a sigh of relief as she looked at Lin Yun.

Lin Yun gave it several attempts, but he realized that he couldn’t budge his astral energy ocean, and he was no different from an ordinary person now.

“Dragon Locking Shackles, even an expert in the Dragon Pulse Realm can be sealed. You’re already very strong since you can force me to use this trump card, and I will remember your name.” Bai Liuying winked while she comforted Lin Yun. She appreciated Lin Yun’s talent and felt somewhat guilty that she had to resort to the Dragon Locking Shackles.

“Uh, I actually have three methods to defeat you without breaking free from the seal.” Lin Yun said. He could tell that Bai Liuying had exhausted a great deal of energy just to seal off his cultivation, not to mention that it wasn’t easy for her to execute the Maneuver Word Art and the injuries she suffered. So her current condition wasn’t any better than his.

“Three methods?” Bai Liuying locked her brows with disbelief.

“That’s right. Three methods.” With a single thought, the golden human in his sword ocean emitted a dazzling glow and clasped its hands together. As the sword ocean began to rumble, the Azure Dragon Sword Soul flew from his forehead and released a roar, unleashing an azure dragon immortal sword intent.

This made Bai Liuying throw out a mouthful of blood and fly back. She slammed against the wall and threw out another mouthful of blood. But Lin Yun could tell she hadn’t accepted her loss as she used her Frost and Flame Intent to break free from the Azure Dragon Sword Aura.

“Is this one?” Bai Liuying snorted while she lifted herself up from the ground.

“Not exactly.” Lin Yun clasped his hands together and activated the Blue Dragon Bone. As twenty thousand dragon runes poured out, it formed into a rope that coiled around Bai Liuying.

Restricted by the rope, Bai Liuying felt it was tough to breathe and her face turned red, “Let me go!”

She was really furious. Just a moment ago, she felt guilty that she resorted to the Maneuver Word Art and Dragon Locking Shackles against Lin Yun, but she now realized Lin Yun was cheating, instead. Not only did Lin Yun possess dual sword souls, he even had a Divine Dragon Bone!
