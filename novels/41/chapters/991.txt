Chapter 992 - Azure Dragon Lord

Yu Haotian’s face was terrifyingly dark when he heard the dragon spirit’s words. His lips gradually began to twitch before his face became distorted. Instantly, a name appeared in his mind, Lin Yun!

The first person Yu Haotian thought of was Lin Yun. After all, Lin Yun was practically the strongest person here based on the strength he displayed in the plaza. Back then, Yu Haotian wanted to compete with Lin Yun. If Lin Yun was in his top state, he knew that there was no way he could compete with Lin Yun, who had grasped sky sword intent. So he didn’t doubt that it was Lin Yun who obtained the opportunity above fortune.

He was filled with reluctance as he tried to contain his emotions. But no matter how he tried, his body trembled uncontrollably. He was initially filled with confidence because of the demonic spirit. He followed the demonic spirit’s instructions, which allowed him to double his strength.

His cultivation even reached the pinnacle third soul Heavenly Soul Realm, so he was confident in facing Lin Yun. Additionally, he had a secret powerful artifact to deal with Lin Yun. Who would have thought that all of his effort would go down the drain?

“Damn it! I’ve already come this far…” Yu Haotian’s eyes were filled with reluctance. He would rather be told that he didn’t complete the test than to be told he came in second. After all, he was given hope only to have it snatched away.

“Again?! He snatched my reward yet again!” Yu Haotian smiled mockingly. The Draconic Banquet’s champion, Profound Amber Realm’s seed, and the opportunity above fortune were all snatched away by Lin Yun.

“Don’t worry about it. There’s no way he can digest it even if he can obtain the opportunity above fortune. Furthermore, it’s not that easy to obtain the opportunity above fortune. Who knows if he will come out alive. You might as well cultivate to digest all your harvests and take your strength to a new level. At that time, everything will be yours,” said the demonic spirit in a cautious and soft tone. “I told you this before, he’s destined to be your stepping stone since he failed to kill you three different times.” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

When Yu Haotian heard that, his eyes flickered for a long time before he calmed down. The show had just begun and the victor could be anyone. Even if someone had great fortune in the Heavenly Path, it was futile if they couldn’t get to the end. Furthermore, obtaining the opportunity above fortune didn’t mean that Lin Yun could fully digest it.

Back at the azure dragon’s heart inheritance, Lin Yun was passing through a barrier. As he was about to step into the palace, a massive figure suddenly appeared before him. But Lin Yun didn’t panic and retreated with the Golden Crow Nine Transformations.

When he retreated, countless lightning bolts streaked across the horizon with the appearance of the colossal being. This colossal being was covered with black dragon scales that were incredibly tough and emitted a terrifying dragon aura.

“Azure dragon?” Lin Yun was briefly stunned and began to wonder if this colossal being was the legendary azure dragon. But the more he thought about it, the less probable it seemed. Even if the azure dragon retracted its aura, it shouldn’t be possible for Lin Yun to get close with his strength. In the end, he could only guess that it was a manifestation.

Thinking about it this way, Lin Yun calmed down because he knew that the dragon spirit wouldn’t harm him. Right now, the azure dragon was staring at Lin Yun to see through him. However, the dragon spirit realized that it couldn’t see through Lin Yun.

Lin Yun’s scalp tingled from the glare. The dragon spirit was a little too unfriendly, but Lin Yun remembered that the dragon spirit didn’t say much at the gate either.

“Jun Wu, he’s clean. Don’t scare our little friend here.” A smile sounded out. When Lin Yun raised his head, he saw a black middle-aged man figure who gave an amicable feeling in comparison to the dragon spirit.

“He’s weird. He seems to have secrets that even I can’t see through,” said the dragon spirit as it continued to glare at Lin Yun.

The middle-aged man smiled, “I know. Go down for now. His secrets are unlike others, but he won’t threaten the inheritance. So you don’t have to worry about it.”

After the middle-aged man spoke, the dragon spirit slowly faded away.

Looking at the middle-aged man who had appeared out of nowhere, Lin Yun frowned, “Who are you?”

“Me? My name is Jiang Ling, but most people address me as the Azure Dragon Lord. That dragon spirit is called Jun Wu, and I’m considered half of its owner. It doesn’t have any enmity except that it’s a little indifferent,” said the middle-aged man after a brief pondering.

“Azure Dragon Lord, Jiang Ling, owner of the dragon spirit…” Lin Yun’s face became grave as he looked at the middle-aged man.

“So many years have passed and someone finally managed to complete the test entirely. I have no idea how many people have died so far… but you’re the first person to ever meet me,” smiled Jiang Ling while looking at Lin Yun.

When Lin Yun heard that, he instantly understood that this person was talking about those corpses at the bottom of the ocean. But just thinking about it sent chills down his spine because this meant that everyone who accepted the test practically died.

“Greetings, Senior. Let me apologize for my rudeness from before,” said Lin Yun.

“Don’t worry about it. I’m just a remnant piece of a soul. I’m sure you’re here for the inheritance, so I’ll be direct,” said Jiang Ling.

When Lin Yun heard that, his eyes shined with anticipation.

“If it was someone else, the test would have come to an end with the dragon spirit giving you a monarch fortune body-refining technique.” Jiang Ling paused briefly before he continued, “But you’re different. You’re the first to complete the test and it seems that you have some karma with this Azure Dragon Palace. So I’ll give you two choices. Choice number one, you can leave with the monarch fortune body-refining technique.”

“What about the second choice?” Lin Yun asked.

“The second choice is an opportunity above fortune. But if you want to obtain it, you’ll have to make it through a test. If you fail the test, you’ll leave with nothing. Make sure you think carefully,” smiled Jiang Ling with his eyes squinted.

“No need to think. I pick the second,” replied Lin Yun. “So, what’s the test about?”

“You have to take a palm from me. However, I’ll suppress my cultivation to the same level as you,” replied Jiang Ling.

When Lin Yun heard that, his heart sank and began to wonder if it was a joke. Even if Jiang Ling was only a piece of the original soul and suppressed his cultivation, he was still strong. After all, even if Lin Yun suppressed his cultivation in the Violet Palace Realm and returned to the Profound Amber Realm, he was confident that no one could take a palm from him.

“You’re going to use a martial technique to attack?” Lin Yun probed.

“Of course,” smiled Jiang Ling. Lin Yun took a deep breath as he locked his brows together. This would be really tough for him.

“If you can’t take the palm, you might lose your life. It’s not going to be easy to obtain the opportunity,” said Jiang Ling with a grave expression. “Then again, if you have any regrets, you can get lost with a monarch fortune body-refining technique!”

Lin Yun realized where the dragon spirit got its nasty temper from. When Lin Yun raised his head, he saw Jiang Ling’s playful gaze. Instantly, he knew that he was belittled. With pride, Lin Yun said, “Senior, there’s no need to provoke me. As a swordsman, there’s no reason for me to back down. I’ll take your palm head-on. I also want to experience how strong you are and if you deserve your reputation!”
