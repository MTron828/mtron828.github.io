Chapter 514 - Ashamed

Leaving Mo Ling’s thoughts aside, Lin Yun was greatly interested in the Infernal Mountain and River Painting. He was familiar with spiritual diagrams. The Azure Transcript was filled with spiritual diagrams and he also had formed one within his body. He knew its power was terrifying from his first hand experience.

Lin Yun believed what Mo Ling said about her defeating a Violet Palace Realm cultivator when she was only in the Profound Martial Realm. He could already do that with his painting, not to mention the Infernal Mountain and River Painting.

“The Infernal Mountain and River Painting is formed with fire spiritual runes, which involve one hundred and eight elementary spiritual runes, sixty eight first grade spiritual runes, and eighteen second grade spiritual runes. This painting is complicated and it can be ranked among the top one hundred spiritual diagrams,” explained Mo Ling.

As she began her lecture, she also accepted questions along the way and answered them. Then again, this wasn’t their first time learning spiritual diagrams, so their questions were rather professional. But even so, most of them had their eyebrows frowned.

Clearly, the Infernal Mountain and River Painting wasn’t easy. Despite Mo Ling’s explanation, it was impossible for them to succeed instantly.

Meanwhile, Lin Yun fell into deep thought as it didn’t seem as hard as he imagined it would be. Since he had experience creating a painting previously, it was rather easy for him to understand. The only trouble was that he wasn’t familiar with the fire spiritual runes because he never came in contact with them before. So he could only focus on trying to remember them.

“Don’t look down on the elementary spiritual runes. They’re crucial for the Infernal Mountain and River Painting to exhibit its full power. Every spiritual diagram has a life in it. The essence in it isn’t violence or dominance, but freedom.”

Lin Yun acknowledged Mo Ling’s explanation. The essence of this painting was like fire raining down from the sky to form a river.

After a brief explanation, Mo Ling stored the painting and she took out a brush along with a blank painting. “Now, I’ll demonstrate how to create the Infernal Mountain and River Painting.”

Then, Mo Ling started to draw the painting. When she held onto the brush, her temperament had undergone a drastic change. She began to release her origin energy along with an invisible pressure. Her strokes were powerful and she completed the hundred and eight elementary spiritual runes without any stopping. Everything flowed smoothly.

When she was done with the elementary spiritual runes, a blazing heat wave suddenly swept through the entire Nightcloud Hall. Lin Yun also wore a grave expression as he memorized the brushstrokes.

Ten breaths’ time later, sixty-eight first grade spiritual runes were added to the painting. The spiritual runes intertwined and the outline of a painting appeared before everyone. This caused an exclamation among the audience because the speed of creation was unbelievable.

Just when everyone exclaimed, Lin Yun frowned his brows because he could sense that the painting was lacking something. It wasn’t because Mo Ling was lacking, but the painting itself was lacking something. Since Lin Yun was a perfectionist, this discovery made him feel butterflies in his stomach.

But he couldn’t find out where the flaw was. Fifteen minutes later, a complete Infernal Mountain and River Painting appeared before everyone. The painting was dazzling and it looked like an ancient beast. If one looked at the painting clearly, they could see the flames flowing down like a river.

“Mo Ling’s attainments in spiritual runes have improved by quite a bit.”

“This should be the limit of the Infernal Mountain and River Painting. I bet that even the creator couldn’t create a stronger version.”

“She’s truly worthy of being a monstrous genius that grasped a divine ability.” The elders nodded their heads as they watched from the side.

Mo Ling smiled at the painting before her with satisfaction on her face. But when she turned around, she returned to her indifferent self. Waving her hand to store the painting, Mo Ling swept her gaze out, “Like I previously said, I’m going to pick a few of you to draw this. Who’s willing to stand out? The one with the worst result will undergo a punishment. Naturally, the best one will also receive a reward. As for the reward? Let’s go with this Infernal Mountain and River Painting in my hand.”

Her words instantly drew cheers from the surroundings. After all, it was a painting that Mo Ling drew herself. Just her name alone would make this painting worth a lot.

“I’m willing to give it a try.” Gu Teng stood up and looked at Mo Ling, “I hope that Senior Sister can give me a chance.”

“I heard that you’ll go through the core disciple test soon. I’ll take this opportunity to test you then.” Mo Ling nodded at Gu Teng with approval.

“I won’t disappoint you!” Gu Teng had excitement on his face because this was a rare opportunity for him to showcase his talents. If he could impress Mo Ling, he would be able to leave a deep impression on her. So much so that he might even be able to take it a step further…

Mo Ling swept her gaze out calmly, “Anyone else?”

“Me too!”

“Me three!”

“Senior Sister, I’m willing to give it a try as well.” Many people were willing to stand out to impress Mo Ling. The Infernal Mountain and River Painting might be hard, but this wasn’t their first time learning it. Naturally, they had some confidence in it.

Looking at this scene, Lin Yun wore a smile because these people were rather confident in themselves. If it wasn’t for the fact that he couldn’t find the flaw of this painting, he also wouldn’t mind going on the stage.

It didn’t take long for Mo Ling to choose eight people. When the eight were chosen, the surroundings finally calmed down. After all, the Infernal Mountain and River Painting wasn’t easy and they would embarrass themselves if they performed poorly. Furthermore, no one felt that they could win with Gu Teng around.

“I see that you’re rather confident. Why don’t you come up and give it a try?” Mo Ling looked at Lin Yun.

“Me?” Lin Yun was briefly stunned before he smiled bitterly. Mo Ling was rather ruthless. She knew that this was his first time here, yet she still picked on him.

“Senior Sister, let’s not make things difficult for Deacon Lin. After all, it’ll be embarrassing if he drew a tortoise,” smiled Gu Teng. His words also caused a commotion in the surroundings.

“Senior Sister Mo, are you sure you want to call on me?” asked Lin Yun calmly.

“Of course. Who else would I call on? I’ve long heard of your name, Flower Burial. Since you think that you’re talented, why don’t you let me have a look at your talent,” smiled Mo Ling with a sly light in her eyes.

Wasn’t Lin Yun too arrogant? She wanted to see if he could still smile later. At the same time, her words instantly cause everyone to wear a playful expression. They could all hear the hidden meaning in Mo Ling’s words. Clearly, she had a grudge with Lin Yun and was currently getting revenge.

At the same time, they were all shocked that a guest deacon, who had just arrived, actually offended Mo Ling. They all felt that Lin Yun would definitely suffer today. After all, Mo Ling did say that the one who did the worst would receive a punishment.

Everyone looked at Lin Yun. Even Gong Ming shook his head lightly with a helpless smile. He knew that Lin Yun would have a tough time getting out of this mess today.

“Alright. I’ll let you have a look then,” smiled Lin Yun as he stood up. It wasn’t his personality to cower when someone challenged him. His words also caused everyone to become silent as they all felt that Lin Yun was arrogant to say such words to Mo Ling.

“Who the hell do you think you are to speak to Senior Sister in this manner?” barked Gu Teng.

“Who the hell is a bastard like you to interfere in my matters?” smiled Lin Yun coldly as he looked at Gu Teng. Not only did Mo Ling try to make things difficult for him, but even Gu Teng stood out. He might be fearful of Mo Ling, but he definitely did not fear Gu Teng. If Mo Ling hadn’t interrupted previously, Lin Yun would’ve trampled on Gu Teng.

Lin Yun’s words instantly made everyone suck in a cold breath as they looked at Lin Yun with shock.

“You!” Gu Teng pointed at Lin Yun furiously. He couldn’t accept the fact that a mere deacon dared to insult him.

“What are you? You’ve never been insulted in the past? She hasn’t even said anything, but a dog like you came running out to be whipped. What’s the matter? Do you think that a toad like you can catch a swan? Stop dreaming. A bastard like you is nothing,” mocked Lin Yun. Everyone knew that Gu Teng had thoughts about Mo Ling, but no one dared to say anything about it.

But Lin Yun had pointed it out and even mocked Gu Teng about it. This instantly forced everyone to suppress their laughter. At the same time, their gazes changed as they looked at Lin Yun. Regardless of Lin Yun’s strength, he had a ruthless mouth. Gu Teng had insulted him once, but he repeatedly insulted Gu Teng.

Gu Teng was furious and he wanted to slaughter Lin Yun at this second. But just when he was about to attack, a bark sounded out, “Stop!”

Mo Ling looked at Lin Yun coldly, “What a ruthless mouth you got there. But I wonder if you have the ability to back it up. If you can’t satisfy me, then don’t blame me for being impolite.” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Senior Sister is right. I’ll let you embarrass yourself on the stage openly,” said Gu Teng as he walked up the stage.
