Chapter 1818 - Heavenly Thunder Palace

“What do you mean?” An Liuyan asked vigilantly.

Shaking his head, Gu Jun nervously said, “I don’t know.”

His words made Lin Yun stare at him, and he had a feeling that the latter had something to hide. When Gu Jun felt a chill run down from his due to Lin Yun’s gaze, he said, “You bastard, don’t look at me. I’m really not from the Black Tortoise’s lineage!”

Lin Yun didn’t dwell on that and carried on forth. As the lightning became even more ferocious, they could occasionally hear the resounding screams, and the crowd in the surrounding area greatly decreased.

Everyone kept a distance amongst themselves, and didn’t dare to stick too close. They were all here for the inheritance, and no one wanted to die halfway through. After all, it would be too much of a grievance if they lost their lives without even seeing any treasures.

Thus, everyone kept a distance between themselves with rapport, using various means to protect themselves. As dragon origin fluctuated, they practically used whatever they had to face the lightning.

Lin Yun’s group also carefully avoided the lightning, and they had to decrease their speed because of that. But suddenly, Lin Yun’s senses began to start alarming him.

“Stop!” Lin Yun stopped and raised his head. He could see the demonic clouds a few hundred miles away gradually forming into a vortex. In the vortex, there were lightning flickers coming from it, and Lin Yun was familiar with this scene. After his dragon pulses reached nine thousand feet, the core of his tribulation would turn into a pool. But this vortex was more than ten times bigger than the one he faced in his tribulation.

“The Dragon Tribulation Lightning Pool!” Lin Yun trembled with traces of fear lingering within his pupils for the first time. This was because the Black Tortoise Underground Palace was too close to the Dead Sea.

But the moment Lin Yun blurted that out, blinding white lightning descended from the lightning vortex, and the lightning split into countless branches that landed on the sea. In just a split second, over a hundred people evaporated on the spot, and they couldn’t even do anything to resist. They couldn’t even scream out, and most of the people who died were Profound Life Stage experts. This naturally scared many people.

“Run!”

“Escape!”

“It’s the Dragon Tribulation Lightning Pool!” The lightning vortex began to expand, launching an indiscriminate attack on this entire region.

“Go!” Lin Yun couldn’t be bothered by it too much. He held onto An Liuyan’s hand before pushing his movement technique to the limit, turning into a streak of light and fleeing. In the next second, the place he was originally at was enveloped by lightning.

When Lin Yun turned around, his face changed, “Old man!”

Gu Jun had vanished just like that, not leaving anything behind. This scene made An Liuyan take in a cold breath because this was too terrifying.

“What are you guys doing?! Run!” Just when they were shocked, they quickly turned around to see Gu Jun. That old man had fled the fastest, and he didn’t even turn around, executing various means to run for his life.

Everyone else was almost dead, but the old man was fine and already threw them behind. This made their lips twitch, but Lin Yun quickly chased after Gu Jun with An Liuyan. His Divine Sunchasing Art was only at the Dragon Pulse Realm, and he didn’t have the Samsara Edict Realm section. It was enough till he reached the ninth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm, but it was a little lacking when compared to the Samsara Edict Realm.

Not to mention that he couldn’t open up the golden crow wings, the strongest means of the Divine Sunchasing Art that could increase his speed by several folds. But fortunately, his Sword Heart warned him against doing it.

“Young Master, look at Elder Gu.” An Liuyan suddenly said.

When Lin Yun raised his head, he soon noticed something unusual about Gu Jun. The latter’s speed wasn’t fast, and he could avoid the lightning before it descended, as if he already knew where it would fall. If he didn’t look at it carefully, he wouldn’t be able to notice it.

“That old fellow! Chase after him!” Lin Yun cursed. He quickly chased after Gu Jun and grabbed the old man to his side.

“Brat, what are you doing? Don’t drag me down!” Gu Jun quickly struggled.

“Don’t think about running.” Lin Yun said. Right then, a bolt of lightning descended from the sky, and Lin Yun firmly grabbed onto Gu Jun, preventing him from running.

“Brat, let go! The lightning is descending! Don’t drag me down with you!” Gu Jun anxiously yelled. But just when the lightning was about to descend, it strangely landed a few hundred meters away from them, causing a huge splash. When the water was about to splash over, Lin Yun used his sword aura to block it out.

“Nice acting.” Lin Yun looked at Gu Jun. Mei Zihua was also an actor, but his acting was poor and he only grasped the essence of drama. But Gu Jun was really an actor that even scared him earlier.

Gu Jun’s face turned red, and he awkwardly smiled, “Hehe. Maybe I’m blessed by karma, and this is why the lightning doesn’t hit me?”

“Carry on acting.” Lin Yun did not choose to argue and merely looked at Gu Jun.

“Young Master, look over there!” An Liuyan’s face suddenly changed.

When Lin Yun directed his attention over, he saw Mei Zihua struggling to dodge the descending lightning a few thousand meters away. Mei Zihua seemed to be targeted by the lightning, and it would fall wherever he went. The thunderclouds were rumbling in the sky, and lightning magma was like a waterfall trapping him.

Gu Jun’s face became happy seeing that Mei Zihua was in trouble, and he chuckled, “I can tell from a glance that that brat isn’t a good person. Look, even heaven wants him dead.”

Didn’t I tell Mei Zihua not to come? Lin Yun was having a headache because Mei Zihua appeared just when he was thinking about him. Wasn’t this too much of a coincidence? He could roughly know why the tribulation targeted Mei Zihua. The latter grasped the Great Saint Tune, not to mention his mental cultivation was higher than anyone here, and nothing could be hidden from the thunderclouds.

“Keep your eyes on this old man.” Lin Yun said to An Liuyan.

With a sword vibration, Lin Yun drew the Flower Burial Sword and manipulated it from afar. As the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent empowered his sword, it flew towards Mei Zihua.

When lightning and sword rays collided, the lightning was like a river being split by the Flower Burial Sword. Sometime later, when Lin Yun created a safe region, he reached out with his right hand, executing the Azure Dragon Grasp.

It was dangerous for him to execute this secret technique because his identity would be exposed if he wasn’t careful. But he didn’t have the luxury of time to consider that. When a thunderstorm vortex appeared within his palm, a giant palm flew over and grabbed Mei Zihua.

When the Flower Burial Sword returned to the sheath, Mei Zihua still hadn’t recovered from his fear. After he regained his foothold, he was touched as he looked at Lin Yun, “Lin Xiao, you saved me!”

But Lin Yun couldn’t be bothered about him, and turned to Gu Jun, “Old man, lead the way.”

“I’m just an old man. I don’t have that ability.” Gu Jun looked reluctant, but he still led the way.

This time, he noticed something unusual when he traveled beside Gu Jun. He could sense an ancient aura being emitted from this old man, and even his Blue Dragon Bone would be drawn when the old man’s vitality surged. Yet, the old man was still trying to deny that he wasn’t a Black Tortoise’s descendant.

Their remaining journey was smooth, but they still had to pretend that they were avoiding the lightning in order to not attract more attention. Along the way, they could see countless charred corpses on the ground, and they didn’t even leave behind a complete corpse.

An hour later, Lin Yun’s group of four stopped, and they looked at the thunderclouds in the sky. The pitch-black clouds in the sky had become bright purple.

Under the purple thunderclouds, there was a magnificent underground palace hovering in the air being wrapped up in nine-colored lightning. While standing before this palace, they all felt insignificant before it.

This should be the Thunder Black Tortoise Underground Palace. The purple thunderclouds covered a few thousand miles, and Lin Yun couldn’t help being shocked while looking at it. This should just be the tip of the iceberg, and the Black Tortoise’s lineage probably had a time of unimaginable glory in the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea in the past.

Back then, this place still wasn’t called the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea. In that golden age, this place was called the Heavenly Saint Lake. Above it was a complete star that hovered in the sky. But after the battle between deities, this place became the Heavenly Domain’s Unholy Sea under the influence of the demonic aura.

“This is the Black Tortoise Underground Palace? This place is grand.” An Liuyan couldn’t help saying.

“Perhaps it might be the Heavenly Black Tortoise Palace.” Lin Yun nodded. He recalled the Heavenly Nirvana Pavilion, and this palace might be something similar. It’s just that it wasn’t built underground, and it sank after the battle between deities.

“That’s right. This place was called the Heavenly Thunder Palace in the past, one of the thirty-six heavenly palaces shrouding the Heavenly Domain Star.” Gu Jun sighed. As he spoke, he immediately noticed he had a slip of the tongue again. When he looked around, he saw Lin Yun, An Liuyan, and Mei Zihua looking at him.L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Elder Gu, carry on. I’m curious about this Heavenly Thunder Palace.” An Liuyan smiled.

“I’m just bullshitting, and that’s all that I heard. It’s not real!” Gu Jun’s face flushed. Now, even Mei Zihua, who was the slowest amongst them, could feel something unusual about this old man.

Right then, several figures flew over from the surroundings. Aside from Kou Tianhua’s group of three, there were many others who emanated a fearsome aura, and they were all at the last phase of the Profound Life Stage.

This made Lin Yun surprised because he didn’t see these people back on Profound Thunder Island. These people were all experts, and they kept a low profile all this time.

When Lin Yun looked around, Kou Tianhua also noticed him, and he grinned, “Lin Xiao, it’s great to see you alive. I was worried that I might not be able to get the Demonfeather Order after you die. It looks like I don’t have to worry about that now.”

He purposely raised his voice, attracting many people’s attention.

“Brother Lin, we meet again.” Another group of people appeared, and this person was Yu Wenxiu of the Ming Cult, whom Lin Yun met back at the Martial Dao Tea Party.

Not long later, the Heavenly Flame Sect’s Yan Chihuo also showed up, and the appearance of two holy lands made the surroundings lively. But Lin Yun was vigilant, and he didn’t respond to them. This was because his relationship with the Ming Cult and Heavenly Flame Sect was neither good nor bad.

At the Martial Dao Tea Party, these people wouldn’t do anything to him because of the rules and their status as disciples of the holy lands. But in the Black Tortoise Void Sea, it was uncertain now, especially since they made a breakthrough to the Samsara Edict Realm.
