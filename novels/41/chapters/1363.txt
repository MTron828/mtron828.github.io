Chapter 1363 - Invincible!

As six Samsara Edict Realm experts appeared at the same time, they all stood beside Lin Zhen, which spoke of their attitude. At the same time, a series of exclamations resounde because this scene had far exceeded everyone’s expectations. No one had expected that the six powerful sects would stand on the Sword Sect’s side.

Even the Profound Sky Sect was surprised and became nervous. Initially, the Sword Sect had no choice but to hand over Lin Yun after Zhuge Qingyun defeated Lin Zhen. But no one had expected that six out of the eight powerful sects would stand out at the same time and turn the tables around.

In the eyes of everyone, even if Zhuge Qingyun was strong, they didn’t feel that he could defeat six enemies of the same cultivation level. Lin Zhen slowly stood with a sword in his hand as his aura started to accumulate.

“This grandeur is really impressive.” Zhuge Qingyun mocked. “Hahaha, so many people are ganging up on me!”

He really never expected that the powerful sects would join forces to stand on Lin Zhen’s side. Previously, when he saw these people approaching, he thought that they still wanted the Great Saint Origin. He never expected that they had actually formed an alliance.

“Mister Zhuge, you’re truly the most outstanding disciple under Tian Xuanzi. You’ve grown so fast in just over a decade. It looks like the Profound Sky Sect has a successor!” An old monk from the Vajra Monastery said as he became enveloped in a golden holy light. He meant what he said because the strength that Zhuge Qingyun had shown proved it.

“Venerable, what are you trying to say?” Zhuge Qingyun said with a playful smile.

“This old monk here doesn’t wish to fight you, nor does the Vajra Monastery wish to fight the Profound Sky Sect,” said the old monk.

“Then leave, don’t poke your nose in my business,” replied Zhuge Qingyun coldly.

“Amitabha” The old monk chanted but he didn’t leave as Zhuge Qingyun said.

“Zhuge Qingyun, since it wasn’t obtained by your Profound Sky Sect, why are you still forcing it?” The Thunder Sect’s Samsara Edict Realm expert said to Zhuge Qingyun. This was a purple-clothed old man. He was emitting a powerful lightning aura that enveloped him. But when he looked at Zhuge Qingyun, he didn’t dare to be careless at all.

“We have already formed an alliance beforehand. No matter which force obtains the Great Saint Origin, the rest of us will have to help. So I hope that you can understand, Zhuge Qingyun,” said the grey-clothed old man from the Heavenly Blade Pavilion.

He was wearing a grave expression when he looked at Zhuge Qingyun. If they didn’t have to fight, they naturally wouldn’t want to fight. After all, Zhuge Qingyun was too terrifying and had an invincible momentum in the Samsara Edict Realm.

“Let’s end it here. You’re strong, but you have no chance if all of us join forces,” said a middle-aged man from the Emerald Jade Manor. They wanted to force Zhuge Qingyun to back down because it would be the best.

But just when everyone else was feeling that Zhuge Qingyun would drop this matter, Zhuge Qingyun showed no signs of retreating and started smiling, “Haha.”

His laughter was calm, and this instantly made all the Samsara Edict Realm experts around Lin Zhen become nervous.

“All of you are considered my seniors, and all of you are more than a thousand years old altogether. You guys are pretty famous in the Ancient Barren Domain, and I know that you guys have no enmity against me. To be honest, I also don’t have any enmity against you guys, including Elder Lin Zhen,” said Zhuge Qingyun.

As mockery flashed in his pupils, he continued, “Even Lin Zhen is kneeling before me, and yet you guys dare to stand before me? Fine then. Since you guys want to be humiliated, then I’ll fulfill all your wishes. So, do you guys want to come at me together or one by one? I’m fine with it either way.”

His words instantly made the surroundings fall into silence. When Lin Zhen heard what Zhuge Qingyun said, his face changed because Zhuge Qingyun was too arrogant and simply unreasonable.

“Sorry about that, then!” Just when everyone’s faces changed, the old monk from the Vajra Monastery stepped out.

When he stepped forth, holy light began to shine beneath his feet as he clasped his hands together before Zhuge Qingyun. The holy light was majestic, making the old monk’s face solemn as he became enveloped in a golden light.

As the old monk’s aura continued to rise, the aura from the old monk started to clash with the nine rainbow lights enveloping Zhuge Qingyun. Not long later, his lips moved and he started reciting a Buddhist scripture. This instantly made the chanting of the Buddhist scripture to start echoing with fine runes spreading out and glowing before they descended from the sky.

But no matter how he recited the Buddhist scripture, the nine rainbow lights enveloping Zhuge Qingyun glowed and looked profound. At the same time, the holy light swiftly evaporated the ocean water as the ocean started to boil.

Facing his move, Zhuge Qingyun merely fanned himself casually with a fan. Looking at this scene, the remaining Samsara Edict Realm expert’s lips twitched because they could tell that Zhuge Qingyun’s Profound Sky Canon had reached a terrifying height. “The Profound Sky Canon!”

“I have a six-syllable Sanskrit mantra that I would like you to hear. Om Mani Padme Hum!” Zhuge Qingyun roared indifferently.

When Zhuge Qingyun chanted the six-syllabled Sanskrit mantra through the Profound Sky Canon, the chant that should be a Buddhist mantra suddenly became demonic. In the next second, black holy light began to start accumulating behind Zhuge Qingyun.

His six-syllabled Sanskrit mantra also disrupted the old monk from the Vajra Monastery to chant his Buddhist scripture. This made the old monk let out a snort before he separated his hands and pushed a palm at Zhuge Qingyun.

When the old man unleashed his attack, a gigantic golden palm manifested and flew towards Zhuge Qingyun. When he pushed his palm out, the power contained in the golden palm was unbelievably powerful.

But Zhuge Qingyun had no change on his face and threw out the fan in his hand. After seeing the fan that Zhuge Qingyun threw, the old monk continued to push his palm, to which Zhuge Qingyun faced his attack head-on by pushing his palm out as well.

When the two palms collided, the old monk threw out a mouthful of blood before he took three steps back. As the old monk stretched both of his hands, a staff enveloped in holy light appeared. It was a thousand-runed saint artifact with a divine rune engraved on it, and its appearance instantly attracted everyone’s attention as it emitted the power it held. The name of it was Vajra Demon Subduing Staff.

When the old monk held onto the staff and swung it, the space before him began to crumble. But Zhuge Qingyun didn’t panic and grabbed onto the fan that had fallen and clashed with the staff. When the fan clashed with the staff, the saint runes on the surface of the staff began to crumble and the light that was emitted from the staff swiftly dimmed at a visible speed.

“H-How is this possible?” The old monk exclaimed in shock. But before he could recover from his shock, Zhuge Qingyun pulled back the fan and slanted to the side before he pushed his left hand out.

Zhuge Qingyun’s attack easily destroyed the holy light enveloping the old man, causing the old monk to throw out a mouthful of blood before he quickly retreated. He knew that he had lost to Zhuge Qingyun in a head-on fight.

“Let me face him!” The purple-clothed old man from the Thunder Sect finally made a move. As the lightning aura around him manifest into a talisman in a split second, a dazzling sun enveloped in lightning and flames began to rise into the sky with lightning crackling and flames lighting up the surroundings.

But Zhuge Qingyun didn’t retreat when facing him. He stomped his foot on the ground before he rose to the sky. In the next second, ten water geysers shot out from the ocean and formed into dragons before charging at the purple-clothed old man.

This scene made the Samsara Edict Realm experts from the Emerald Jade Manor and Heavenly Blade Pavilion’s faces change with their eyes squinted. At this moment, they no longer hesitated and charged toward Zhuge Qingyun in a pincer attack.

Zhuge Qingyun merely stood there with his aura sweep out from within his body. He faced two opponents at the same time while he manipulated the water dragons to attack the purple-clothed old man. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

But right at that moment, zither music began to resound with strands of soundwaves drilling into Zhuge Qingyun’s mind. The middle-aged woman from the Heavenly Note Sect had finally made her move, playing music through a zither with her long hair fluttering in the wind. This made Zhuge Qingyun frown his brows with annoyance on his face. Clearly, the zither music had caused him some trouble.

As for the Samsara Edict Realm expert from the Profound Valley, he began to form seals with both of his hands and spiritual runes slowly rose to the sky. He had created a painting that was nearly a thousand feet high, looking majestic and grand. The countless spiritual runes then formed into a saint cauldron with a thousand dragons coiling around it. When he was done, the painting then shrunk in size before it flew towards Zhuge Qingyun.

When everyone saw this scene, every single one of them was left dumbfounded without exception. They couldn’t clearly see the fight between Samsara Edict Realm experts, but they could roughly tell which direction this matter was going to develop in. Zhuge Qingyun faced six opponents on the same level as him and even obtained a slight advantage without showing any signs of defeat, and this was simply too insane.

This scene also made Lin Yun’s face change. He had a feeling that this matter today wouldn’t be able to end that easily. Right at this moment, Zhuge Qingyun blocked the Samsara Edict Realm expert from the Emerald Jade Manor before the nine rainbow lights converged on the surface of his body and formed into an armor.

Then, he formed a fist with his right hand while grabbing onto the fan and threw a punch out at the grey-clothed old man from the Heavenly Blade Pavilion’s chest. His attack instantly caused the old man’s chest to sink in and created a crater.

Right at this moment, a beam of light shot out, aimed at the middle-aged woman who was playing music. This made the middle-aged woman’s face change as she quickly stopped playing the zither and used it to block the beam of light.

As the zither shattered into pieces, Zhuge Qingyun laughed because the middle-aged woman would no longer be able to play her music without her instrument. Zhuge Qingyun then opened up the fan in his hand and swung it out like a blade, nearly severing the Emerald Jade Manor’s Samsara Edict Realm expert from his waist.

“Trap!” Right at that moment, the heavenly spiritualist from the Profound Valley finally attacked with the painting that he had manifested. As space distorted, Zhuge Qingyun was dragged into the painting and this made the heavenly spiritualist’s face rejoice before he waved his hand and summoned the painting back to him.

“We stopped him?” The other Samsara Edict Realm experts said in an uncertain tone with their faces pale.

“There’s no way he can escape now that he’s trapped in my Thousand Dragon Cauldron!” The Profound Valley’s heavenly spiritualist said in a confident tone.

But just when he was done, the painting that was flying back to him exploded and Zhuge Qingyun slowly walked out of the painting. Before the heavenly spiritualist could reveal shock on his face, Zhuge Qingyun’s left hand descended like a dragon claw and grabbed onto that heavenly spiritualist’s head, causing the heavenly spiritualist to throw out a mouthful of blood before he fell to his knees.

Easily subduing the heavenly spiritualist, Zhuge Qingyun opened his fan and laughed, “You guys are just a bunch of trash. There’s no way you guys can contend with me even if all of you join forces together! Come, let’s continue our fun!”

Zhuge Qingyun then grabbed onto that heavenly spiritualist’s wrist, causing the saint runes around the heavenly spiritualist that protected him to start crumbling before he sent the heavenly spiritualist flying with a kick.

“Profound Sky Canon—Universal Reversal!” Before the other Samsara Edict Realm experts could respond in time, Zhuge Qingyun lifted a sun and moon with his left hand, causing the surrounding space to start distorting.

This made everyone’s face change. They were having great difficulty bearing the pressure coming from Zhuge Qingyun. But when Zhuge Qingyun pushed his palm out, they could finally not bear it any longer.

As black primitive chaos energy exploded, rainbow light turned into tens of thousands of light beams that shot out. This caused a massive explosion on the surface of the ocean. Aside from Zhuge Qingyun, the other Samsara Edict Realm experts were heavily injured, and their injuries even reached their internal organs.

When they descended once more, they all had fear reflected in their pupils when they looked at Zhuge Qingyun because the latter was simply too terrifying. Right at this moment, no words could describe Zhuge Qingyun’s strong stance. This left everyone, except Feng Jue, dumbfounded.

He had been accumulating his sword aura when Zhuge Qingyun was facing those Samsara Edict Realm experts to destroy the finger that suppressed him. When he got back on his feet, he just happened to see the scene of Zhuge Qingyun breaking free from the Thousand Dragon Cauldron and was left completely shocked.

But when he recovered from his shock, Feng Jue’s face drastically changed and arrived beside Lin Yun in a flash. “Leave!”

Before Lin Yun could react, Feng Jue had already dragged him away. “Where are you bringing me? No one is his opponent in the Profound Azure Prefecture, and not a single one of us can escape!”

“Who says that I want to escape? There’s no way I can take this lying down!” Feng Jue said.

“Then, where are we going?”

“To the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect to look for my junior brother! I don’t believe that he can hold back from making a move with our master being humiliated!” Feng Jue said with a decisive light flashing through his pupils while he gritted his teeth.

Lin Yun had no idea how that was different from running. But his face suddenly changed. Was the ‘junior brother’ that Feng Jue spoke of Jian Jingtian? The Jian Jingtian who was ranked first on the three rankings? At this moment, Lin Yun began to wonder if Jian Jingtian could really stop Zhuge Qingyun.
