Chapter 1471 - Aquaheaven Sword Technique!

Lin Yun’s words left everyone dumbfounded. They couldn’t believe what they were seeing and couldn’t comprehend how Lin Yun managed to do it. Everyone nearly went insane because they couldn’t believe that someone at the two-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm could hold onto the advantage after both sides drew their swords. After all, Jin Xuanyi was a five-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm expert!

This was so unreasonable and unbelievable that they couldn’t figure it out. They immediately thought of Huangfu Yan being severely injured when Lin Yun fought the four geniuses from the Earth Ranking. The remaining three drew their swords and unleashed their sword techniques, but Lin Yun closed his eyes. When he reopened them, he took a step out and instantly resolved their attacks.

That scene was similar to this, but they couldn’t figure out how Lin Yun managed to do it. Everything happened for a reason, but no one could find the answer. If it could be explained with firmament sword intent in the past, that didn’t make any sense now.

Even if firmament sword intent at greater mastery was heaven-defying, they couldn’t figure out how he managed to fight Jin Xuanyi, who was three stages above him, not to mention that Jin Xuanyi’s swordsmanship wasn’t weak, either. Jin Xuanyi had fused his monarch intent into his sky sword intent, making it comparable to firmament sword intent.

But when facing Lin Yun, his sword techniques were no different from a child swinging his sword and were instantly resolved by Lin Yun. Especially when Lin Yun turned the tables around at the last moment. In the blink of an eye, Jin Xuanyi threw out a mouthful of blood from the impact of Lin Yun’s scabbard.

“H-How did he manage to do it?” Mu Qingqing was shocked before she said in a trembling voice. When she turned her head around, she saw that her elder sister’s eyes were flickering as if she was in deep thought. She instantly recalled how her sister reacted when she first saw Lin Yun and asked, “Big Sister, did you discover something?”

“Don’t stand in my way.” Mu Xueqin ignored her and gently shoved her away with her gaze still fixed on the Celestial Observing Lake. The Celestial Observing Lake was far from there location, and she had to focus if she wanted to see everything with her naked eyes. This was why she was unhappy when Mu Qingqing stood in her way.

“Hmph!” Mu Qignqing snorted and stomped her feet on the ground. Her elder sister definitely discovered something. So she was furious that her sister wasn’t paying any attention to her, and she was really curious about how Lin Yun managed to accomplish what he did.

At the heart of the lake, jin Xuanyi and Ji Shuxuan looked at the ninth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flower that landed at the tip of Lin Yun’s scabbard. For the first time, they felt pressured by Lin Yun, with beads of sweat covering their foreheads.

This was a strange feeling because, with their strengths and trump cards, there was no way Lin Yun could enter their eyes. But right now, Lin Yun gave them a strange and indescribable feeling. It was simply too bizarre!

They knew they had to work together if they wanted to face Lin Yun. As a decisive light flashed through Ji Shuxuan’s pupils, he finally let go of his pride. This was because they didn’t have much of a choice, even if Jin Xuanyi used his ghost spirit martial technique against Lin Yun. So this meant they would have to join forces if they wanted to deal with him.

Thinking of this, Ji Shuxuan laughed at himself. He initially believed that the Five Peaks Competition was a stage set for him and Jin Xuanyi, making it their last battle in the Earth Ranking. But all the limelight was snatched by Lin Yun, including the ninth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flower.

Ji Shuxuan looked at Lin Yun and said, “Junior Brother Lin’s strength is admirable. In terms of strength, I’m afraid that the champion of the Five Peaks Competition will go to you. But we don’t want to give up on the ninth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flower so easily. So I’m sorry!”

His words instantly caused an uproar because this meant that Ji Shuxuan and Jin Xuanyi were going to gang up on Lin Yun. They were the Twin Stars of the Earth Ranking, and it was unbelievable that they would gang up on Lin Yun.

For many years, they constantly fought on the Earth Ranking, and everyone knew they were rivals. This was why it felt even more unbelievable that they would work together.

But Ji Shuxuan was pretty calm about it. This was because he knew that they might not be able to suppress Lin Yun if only one of them fought him. But the ninth-grade Azure Lotus Sword Flower concerned the Five Peaks Competition's champion and the Dragon-Blooded Crystal. So neither of them could give up on it so easily.

“You don’t have to apologize to me. Everyone has to fight for resources in this world. Since we’re in this world, we naturally have to fight.” Lin Yun smiled.

When Ji Shuxuan heard those words, surprise flashed through his pupils, and his impression of Lin Yun immediately improved.

“How about this? Since you didn’t practice a ghost spirit martial technique, we won’t use them either. If we lose, then we lose.” Ji Shuxuan said.

Jin Xuanyi didn’t say a word. He also shared the same thoughts earlier when he didn’t use his ghost spirit martial technique against Lin Yun. They were all disciples of the Sword Sect. Even if they fought and competed, it was important to have a bottom line.

“That’s not necessary.” Lin Yun laughed. “Like what I’ve said, it was my master’s instructions that I don’t practice any ghost spirit martial techniques. As for the reason, it’s hard for me to explain it in a few words. So the two of you can go ahead and use your ghost spirit martial techniques.”

His words made Jin Xuanyi and Ji Shuxuan exchange a glance. Since Lin Yun already said this much, they had nothing to say. After all, Lin Yun even brought out the Radiant Sword Saint. So if they didn’t use their ghost spirit sword techniques, it might seem disrespectful to the Radiant Sword Saint.

“Then we won’t go easy on you. Let us see how impressive Senior Radiant’s beloved disciple is!” Ji Shuxuan was the first to attack. As he gently tapped his foot on the lake, the lake’s surface exploded, then he was wrapped in flaming golden light the next moment. He didn’t hesitate to draw his sword and swung it, which was like a flaming mountain that was flying over.

That was the ghost spirit martial technique of the Scarlet Firmament Peak, the Divine Flaming Mountain Sword!

On the other side, Jin Xuanyi didn’t just stand there. He soared into the sky like a bolt of lightning. When his sword aura bloomed behind him, all the phenomena manifested into thirty-six swords that were hovering around him. That was the ghost spirit martial technique of the Golden Firmament Peak, the Greatflow Seventy-Two Swords!

“Good!” Lin Yun gently shook his wrist, and the Azure Lotus Sword Flower at the tip of his sheath flew to the sky before he drew the Flower Burial Sword out with his right hand.

When he drew his sword, his sword aura spread out like a vast sea of clouds with a bright moon hidden in the clouds. At the same time, ripples also spread on the lake’s surface, which soon stretched to a hundred miles.

Clouds contain water, the water reflects the moon, the moon hangs high in the sky, and dragons soar in the sky!

All the phenomena from the Aquaheaven Sword Technique unfolded in that split second, and the Flower Burial Sword in his hand was like a willow branch. When he gently swung his sword, it collided with Ji Shuxuan’s sword, which looked like a flaming mountain.

The sword that looked like a willow branch was slim. But when it came in contact with Ji Shuxuan’s sword, a tremendous power exploded before the boundless mountain began to shatter.

As flames scattered around, Ji Shuxuan suffered a loss in this confrontation, sending him a thousand meters away. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

As the sea of clouds reached the limit, the layer of clouds broke apart with a vast moon hanging high in the sky. Under the moonlight, the Twelve-Petaled Netherflower was like a brand marked on the lake’s surface that perfectly fused with the Aquaheaven Sword Technique.

Jin Xuanyi had charged over with his Greatflow Seventy-Two Swords. His speed was fast, his sword was sharp, and the swords around him constantly sliced through the surrounding atmosphere.

But Lin Yun swayed as he gently drifted across the lake’s surface like a willow tree. He instantly avoided Jin Xuanyi’s attack and the petals of the netherflower drifting over beneath his feet whenever he took a step. As the petals flowed like a stream, they were like lotus lamps on the lake as they floated and drifted on the lake’s surface.

As the Flower Burial Sword danced, he gently blocked the thirty-six swords that had manifested from Jin Xuanyi’s sword aura. In the blink of an eye, they both had exchanged over ten-odd moves on the lake.

Right then, a cold light flashed through Lin Yun’s pupils before the dual sword souls in the center of his brows shone brightly, and he instantly discovered a slight flaw in Jin Xuanyi’s sword aura.

“What’s going on?” Jin Xuanyi’s eyelid twitched. He knew his sword technique had a slight flaw, but it was so insignificant that he didn’t pay much attention to it. After all, it would only appear in a flash.

But when he looked at Lin Yun’s gaze, it made his heart violently throb. Lin Yun, who had been retreating, suddenly took a step forth and turned around, before he gently thrust the Flower Burial Sword with his right hand.

This caught Jin Xuanyi by surprise, and Lin Yun’s sword thrust into his flaw, violently forcing him to retreat. But when he retreated, this small flaw swiftly expanded until it became fatal.

This made Jin Xuanyi’s face stiffen while he wondered if Lin Yun was a demon. He could sense that he was being restrained under Lin Yun’s retaliation, reaching an extremely dangerous level.

Suddenly, Lin Yun took a step forth and gently flicked his wrist, causing a silver explosion on the lake that blinded many people. A moon flew out of the lake before it revolved and slammed against Jin Xuanyi before the latter could respond in time. Taking a head-on hit from the moon, Jin Xuanyi was sent flying away. This made Jin Xuanyi throw out a mouthful of blood as he began to retreat, and he could feel excruciating pain coming from his bones.

But before Lin Yun could take advantage to unleash follow-up attacks on Jin Xuanyi, Ji Shuxuan suddenly flew over with a mountain that crashed and collided with Lin Yun.

The Divine Flaming Mountain Sword that was brought to the manifestation stage unleashed a terrifying power in the hands of Ji Shuxuan. Three sword rays shattered the moon that was created by Lin Yun.

Even if the Divine Flaming Mountain Sword was only a low-grade ghost spirit martial technique, the power wasn’t something that ordinary people could imagine. When the three sword rays destroyed the moon, Ji Shuxuan’s sword aura began to skyrocket. This made Ji Shuxuan look like a rising divine mountain with flames blazing like a sun.

“What’s going on?” But a moon was still hanging in the sky when he raised his head. Likewise, a moon was at the bottom of the lake, instantly leaving him dumbfounded. He even suspected that he was hallucinating at this moment.

But before he could think more about it, Jin Xuanyi returned and landed beside Ji Shuxuan. Then, they worked together and charged at Lin Yun.

But Lin Yun faced Ji Shuxuan and Jin Xuanyi’s ghost spirit martial techniques with ease. Not only was he holding them back by himself, he even gained an advantage in his fight against them. After ten-odd moves, the sword aura of his Aquaheaven Sword Technique reached an unprecedented height.

With a sudden flash, Lin Yun suddenly disappeared. This made Jin Xuanyi and Ji Shuxuan exchange glances before they looked around, trying to find Lin Yun. There was a netherflower slowly revolving on the lake and a moon at the bottom of the lake. Aside from that, they couldn’t see Lin Yun anywhere.

“In the sky!” Right then, Jin Xuanyi yelled and they both raised their heads. They watched as the clouds dispersed, like an opening veil, revealing the moon hidden behind the clouds. On the moon, a person turned back to look at them with a smile. This person was naturally Lin Yun.

But Lin Yun’s smile instantly made Ji Shuxuan and Jin Xuanyi take three steps back, each with their faces becoming pale. They couldn’t figure out what sword technique Lin Yun was currently performing, which brought a huge question mark on their heads.

They recognized that it was the Aquaheaven Sword Technique, but it was nothing like the Aquaheaven Sword Technique that they knew!

When the person on the moon disappeared, Lin Yun had disappeared entirely this time, and he could not be seen anywhere. This made Ji Shuxuan and Jin Xuanyi nervous, with fear and panic looming over their hearts.

“Splitting cloud comes the moon. As flowers dance under the moonlight, you and the moon are both real in the world!” An ethereal voice echoed throughout the surroundings just when fear completely enveloped Ji Shuxuan and Jin Xuanyi.

Lin Yun had appeared with his sword as a figure flew out from both moons that were in the sky and lake. They were also Lin Yun, and they were both swinging their swords. As one hundred and eight intents combined when the two Lin Yuns overlapped, blood splashed out as Ji Shuxuan and Jin Xuanyi’s sword auras significantly fell.

But that wasn’t all. When Lin Yun returned to the ground, he swung his sword again, catching up to Jin Xuanyi and Ji Shuxuan in the blink of an eye.

His sword ray was like a moon that swiftly caught up to Ji Shuxuan and Jin Xuanyi, and no words could describe how breathtaking this sword was. As sparks flew around, Ji Shuxuan and Jin Xuanyi’s swords flew from their hands with fine bloodstains on their necks.

The bloodstains were tiny, but everyone could see that Lin Yun was being merciful with them.
