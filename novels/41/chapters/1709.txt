Chapter 1710 – Strength Recovered!

Lin Yun had experienced four tribulations, and the second was the most dangerous to him. The third was relatively simple, and the fourth was smooth because he had the help of Big Brother Jiang Ling. It wasn’t because Lin Yun’s tribulations have weakened, but the Blue Dragon’s Divine Blood significantly strengthened his physique.

Logically speaking, even if he lost an arm, he could regrow a new one quickly. Then again, it would exhaust a tremendous amount of his vitality, and he would be in a weakened state for a period of time.

The Blue Dragon’s Divine Blood that the Azure Dragon Lord gave him had practically excavated the potential of the Blue Dragon Bone. It also allowed him to cultivate a dragon spirit body-refining technique like the Blue Dragon Skybreaking Art.

After An Liuyan left, Lin Yun began to face his tribulation in the secret realm. The saint aura of the Myriad Flowers Wine and his accumulation in the Ancient Barren Battlefield allowed him to smoothly make a breakthrough without any bottleneck. His cultivation charged through, and he just had to undergo the test of his tribulation. His fifth tribulation was more terrifying than the first four added together.

Four hours later, Lin Yun’s physique was completely rotten, with terrifying flames and lightning lingering on the ground. As he laid on the ground, there wasn’t any complete flesh on his body, and he looked like a dead person. Even his consciousness had started to fade away.

Only his heart was still beating. As his heart pumped, his vitality slowly came back to him. When a powerful wave of energy spread throughout his body along with his pumping heart, his vitality surged, and light began to flow from his tattered body.

His Blue Dragon Bone had been completely activated, and he was regenerating his flesh. He was like a sapling that was granted new life with dragon runes wandering on the surface of his body, emitting a blue light.

Not long later, a robus, perfect figure appeared on the ground, and Lin Yun could sense a boundless energy coursing through his body.

When Lin Yun opened his eyes, a terrifying golden light surged from his pupils, and he suddenly sat with his legs crossed. Five dragon pulses faintly appeared behind him, emitting a saint light that should belong to a Saint. But because he drank the Myriad Flowers Wine, it gave his dragon pulses some saintly radiance.

Letting out a breath, Lin Yun felt satisfied and clenched his hands together with a light flashing within his pupils. He couldn’t remember how often he had been forced into desperate straits on this path. But his injuries this time were the worst. He defeated a Samsara Edict Realm expert, slew a Saint Lord, a Great Saint, and even fought Tian Xuanzi.

Each fight placed his life on the line, and he would’ve died during any of those battles. If he had another go, Lin Yun wasn’t sure if he would still have that courage. His mentality back then was rare to forsake his life and death for his master and the Sword Sect. But he ultimately made it through.

“Tian Xuanzi, I will be back, sooner or later!” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with cold, killing intent. He would never forget what he experienced. If it weren’t for Tian Xuanzi, he wouldn’t have to disguise himself, and his name wouldn’t become taboo in the world.

With a flash, he appeared on a plain in the secret realm and circulated the Blue Dragon Skybreaking Art to practice the Sovereign Dragon Fist. When three seals were activated along with a Sovereign Dragon Seal, a dragon roar echoed from his body and the dragon aura he gave off would increase whenever he formed a seal.

When he formed the Sovereign Dragon Seal, a seven-colored radiance would fly out from his hands, and each beam contained the power to tear apart space. When Lin Yun let out a ferocious roar, the dragon origin within his violet palace exploded.

When the boundless dragon origin poured into his hands and formed the Sovereign Dragon Seal, Lin Yun’s dragon aura quickly broke through the limits of the fifth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. It stopped after reaching the ninth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm.

The seal was like a cauldron containing violent energy and a boundless dragon origin was fluctuating within his body.

Soaring Divine Dragon!

Lin Yun roared and circulated the mantra of the Sovereign Dragon Fist. When his dragon origin began to ignite, thousands of dragons flew out from his body, and there were close to a hundred of them soaring to the sky. At this moment, Lin Yun looked like a dragon king and had the prestige of a deity.

“Looks like I’m still a little lacking…” Lin Yun muttered and circulated the Blue Dragon Skybreaking Art. Pouring a hundred thousand dragon runes into the thousand dragons, the dragons quickly became vivid, and each of the dragons’ pupils had flames blazing within.

Heaven and earth suddenly looked tiny before Lin Yun. When Lin Yun pushed his hands forth, the dragons rampaged within this region. Letting out a breath, he could now practice the second form of the Sovereign Dragon Seal, the Divine Dragon Order. “I’ve finally reached the manifestation stage.”

But he didn’t have to be in a hurry now, and he wanted to gauge his current strength now that he had recovered from his injuries. In the past, he was limited by his injuries and couldn’t unleash his full prowess. But he no longer had such concerns now.

Lin Yun immediately started practicing the Dragon Pulse Realm Section of the Divine Sunchasing Art, which was enough for him to use until he reached the Samsara Edict Realm. After all, the Divine Sunchasing Art was a powerful movement technique; he could continue to practice it in the Saint Realm if he could complete it.

He was fully submerged in practicing the Divine Sunchasing Art, and the Great Sun’s aura that he gave off became even more powerful. He could appear ten miles away at his full strength after he practiced a hundred times.

When he practiced a thousand times, the golden light on him turned into flames that were like a bright sun. When he practiced ten thousand times, he could manifest the Golden Crow phenomenon when he took a step forth. As the Golden Crow spread its wings apart, it cast a massive shadow down on the lake and looked enormous.

Gasping for his breath, Lin Yun’s forehead was covered in enough sweat that it was as though he was just fished out from the water. He was exhausted and had no idea how long he had been practicing. But the Divine Sunchasing Art gradually became more deep and unfathomable when he practiced.

This wasn’t just a movement technique. After reaching the Dragon Pulse Realm Section, this movement technique began to contain the traits of the sun and not just chasing the sun. It might seem like a movement technique, but it was comprehensive and contained everything.

If Lin Yun continued to practice, it was just a matter of time before he grasped the Great Sun Dao. But it was really too exhausting to practice the Divine Sunchasing Art ten thousand times in one go, but he had immediately brought it to greater mastery. He was only half a step away from complete mastery, and the manifestation stage was even further away.

Swallowing a pellet, Lin Yun began to cultivate and gradually became familiar with the three phenomena: Myriad Miles Divine Radiance, Rising Great Sun, and Golden Crow Wings. Since he reached greater mastery in one go, he needed time to stabilize himself to make the three phenomena become a form of innate ability by letting them settle within his body like seeds so that he wouldn’t forget them in the future.

Lin Yun was so immersed in training, it was as if he wanted to make up for the time he wasted. When the Divine Sunchasing Art stabilized at greater mastery, Lin Yun continued cultivating the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

On this day, black petals rose from the ground beneath Lin Yun. A horrifying dreadful aura spread out from the ground when the petals spread out. When sixty-four petals opened up, it was like a stage that enveloped Lin Yun within it, and this was a sign that Lin Yun had reached the seventh stage in the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra.

“Time to head out.” Lin Yun slowly stood up. He still had many things to do, and he couldn’t keep staying here. After all, it might not be exactly good to have everything all crammed together. When he saw An Liuyan upon getting out of the secret realm, he asked, “How long have I been in seclusion?”

“You’ve been in seclusion for thirty-three days.” An Liuyan said. After thirty-three days of seclusion, Lin Yun underwent a drastic transformation. His cultivation might be at the fifth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm; still, An Liuyan could sense a deep and unfathomable aura coming from Lin Yun, and the pressure he gave her even surpassed geniuses at the seventh-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm.

But she was happy for him. Not only did Lin Yun recover from his injuries, he even became stronger than before.

Lin Yun was shocked when he heard that he was in seclusion for thirty-three days. He had lost the concept of time when he cultivated. He told Mu Xueling that he would be back in half a month at most, but it had been a month. He could predict that he would be reprimanded when he returned.

“There’s an old man that kept asking about you, claiming to be an elder from the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion and that he has a good relationship with you.”

“Gu Jun?”

“Yeah. But he has a pretty good temper. We arranged him in a guest room and gave him some Profound Saint Pellets. After that, he no longer asked about you.”

The corner of Lin Yun’s lips twitched when he heard that because that old man wasn’t worried about him at all.

“You want to go and meet him?” An Liuyan asked.

“No hurry. I have something to ask you.” Lin Yun looked at An Liuyan.

“Oh? Please, come with me.” Now that they have taken another step in their relationship, they have become closer. An Liuyan was pretty gentle, and there wasn’t much change in her attitude towards Lin Yun. She didn’t show more affection because of her relationship with Lin Yun, but there would be flames blazing within the depths of her pupils when she occasionally looked at Lin Yun.
