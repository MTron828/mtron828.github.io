Chapter 604 - Who The Hell You Think You Are

Looking at the uneasiness on Mu Chen’s face, Lin Yun could understand the feeling. It wasn’t because Mu Chen was cowardly, but because the killing aura around Ji Wuye was too terrifying.

Ji Wuye had reached the pinnacle Yang stage and he chose to temper his strength further through other means. Tempering his sword intent wasn’t a bad choice, but not everyone had such a terrifying talent like Lin Yun who also grasped the rose painting. The tempering of sword intent was a long and slow process.

This meant that many people would eventually take a different path, not to mention that the disciples of the Bloodwar Sect weren’t exactly kind. So it wasn’t surprising that they would go on the killing path. The baleful aura formed by Ji Wuye’s killing aura had far exceeded many demonic cultivators.

A single glance from him could amplify the fear in people’s hearts. Therefore, aside from Yan Kong, he was acknowledged as the strongest.

“Qin An and Pei Yue are also here!” Two more figures appeared. One had a skinny frame and carried an ancient saber while the other had a crimson glow in his eyes. They were top ten on the outer ranking, so they naturally attracted many people’s attention.

Lin Yun had a strong impression of the two of them. After all, they were the last ones to arrive at the entrance and they had completely disregarded those who weren’t in the ranking as well as those ranked near the bottom.

Lin Yun first looked at Pei Yue. The ancient saber Pei Yue carried was known to be a powerful cosmic artifact known as Nethercloud. The sabre intent on him was terrifying, which Lin Yun sensed despite the fact that it was concealed well.

The other person had a crimson glow in his eyes, and like Yang Fan, he also used a whip as his weapon. Yang Fan was known as the Scarlet Demon Whip, while Qin An was proficient in the Scarlet Python Whip. This meant that his whip was as venomous as a python.

Neither of them were pushovers since they were both ranked in the top ten on the outer ranking, not to mention that they even joined forces.

“Xie Yunqiao has also come!” Xie Yunqiao of the Cloud Trigram Sect was ranked fifty-seven in the previous Draconic Banquet. There was no question that the five of them were the strongest in the Withernorth Sea.

“Guo Xu is also here…”

“Yang Fan has also come!”

“More and more experts are gathering.” As more geniuses gathered, the surrounding area also became busier as everyone was discussing who would obtain the empyreans’ legacy and the Astral Pearl.

But right at this moment, a towering killing aura soared into the sky and started spreading out. This instantly caused the surrounding clamor to die down as everyone looked at Ji Wuye with worry.

Ji Wuye’s cold expression sank even more now. No one knew what Ji Wuye was trying to do. Was he going to start a massacre before the seal broke? Even the Bloodwar Pavilion’s disciples gathered around Ji Wuye wore an unsightly expression as they looked around.

“Has anyone seen my junior brother, Chen Hou?” Ji Wuye asked. His voice wasn’t loud, but everyone had heard it clearly. When everyone heard his question, their hearts sank as they wondered who was that bold enough to touch Ji Wuye’s junior brother.

With Chen Hou’s strength, it shouldn’t be a problem for him to make it to the tomb.

Ji Wuye swept his cold gaze around. Everyone who locked eyes with him quickly lowered their heads as they began to tremble from the killing aura within Ji Wuye’s eyes.

Leading the other disciples from the Bloodwar Pavilion, Ji Wuye stepped forward and grabbed someone random, “Have you seen Chen Hou?”

“N-no…” The person who was grabbed by Ji Wuye on his head began to tremble as he sobbed, “I really have no idea…”

But without warning, Ji Wuye tightened his grip and twisted the person’s head around. The other disciples from the same sect had fear on their faces, but none of them dared to utter a word.

“Someone here dares to kill my junior brother yet doesn’t dare to show up? Don’t worry, I’ll find out,” said Ji Wuye as he led the Bloodwar Pavilion’s disciples forward and constantly grabbed onto people. In just the blink of an eye, three people had already been killed by Ji Wuye. None of them dared to retaliate under Ji Wuye’s killing aura and they were terrified by a single glance.

Only the likes of Yan Kong, Xie Yunqiao and the rest could stop Ji Wuye. But no one wanted to dip their hands in this matter with the empyrean’s tomb opening soon. They even wore a smile as they watched the show.

“Senior Brother Lu, save me!” Another disciple that was grabbed by Ji Wuye was terrified as he turned around at Lu Shixiong, ranked eighty-three on the Draconcloud Ranking.

Hearing his junior brother’s plea for help, Lu Shixiong’s face was ugly. Others might not know how terrifying Ji Wuye was, but as someone who participated in the previous Draconic Banquet, he knew what Ji Wuye’s nickname as the Bloody Butcher meant. If he didn’t step out soon, his junior brother would certainly be killed by Ji Wuye.

“Brother Ji, give me some face. I can assure you that my junior brother has never seen Chen Hou.” In the end, Lu Shixiong still spoke out. No matter what, he was also a genius on the ranking, and he couldn’t just stand by and do nothing.

Seeing that someone finally dared to speak, Ji Wuye finally let go of the person in his hand and looked at Lu Shixiong, “He’s never seen my junior brother? So it looks like you’ve seen him. Dig his eyes out.”

“Brother Ji, are you j-joking?” Lu Shixiong stuttered with his face turning gray. But Ji Wuye didn’t even bat an eye at him as four Bloodwar Pavilion’s disciples rushed over.

Lu Shixiong raised his brow at this scene as he unleashed his aura and held onto his sword. From his aura alone, everyone could tell that he was a formidable figure. It was impossible for the four disciples of the Bloodwar Pavilion to do anything to him and even Ji Wuye might not be able to take his life if he acted himself.

But suddenly, Ji Wuye flicked his finger and a crimson sword aura shot out. By the time everyone heard the sword, Lu Shixiong’s right shoulder had been pierced as his sword fell onto the ground. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Everyone here knew that Ji Wuye was strong, but they never expected that Ji Wuye could disarm a genius on the ranking so easily. He merely flicked his finger and Lu Shixiong was now kneeling on the ground in pain.

The four disciples from the Bloodwar Pavilion didn’t even use much strength to pin Lu Shixiong down. When Lu Shixiong’s fellow disciples saw how easily Lu Shixiong was dealt with, their faces turned pale and they retreated. Lu Shixiong’s lips moved as he wanted to say something, but he was so terrified that he couldn’t utter a word.

“Since he has seen my junior brother, dig his eyes out,” said Ji Wuye.

Upon receiving the instructions, the disciples of the Bloodwar Pavilion acted quickly. “Senior brother, we dug his eyes out.”

Ji Wuye looked around and said, “This is the outcome of those who dare to interrupt me. Do you all understand now?”

By now, everyone was already trembling in fear as they nodded their heads.

Zhang Yuan and the other disciples from the Heavenly Province Academy quickly calmed their hearts, especially Mu Chen whose face had turned pale. But right at this moment, Ji Wuye suddenly turned to look at Mu Chen as he walked over.

Looking at Ji Wuye coming in his direction, Mu Chen’s heart began to beat wildly as fear began to rise in his heart.

“I-I-I’ve never seen him,” said Mu Chen as he stuttered.

“How do you know what I’ll ask when I haven’t asked yet?” Ji Wuye said as he approached.

“I…” Mu Chen was scared out of his wits and his face lost all color.

“Kneel!” Ji Wuye barked.

Mu Chen was startled by Ji Wuye’s voice as his knees began to tremble. But just when he was about to fall on his knees, a hand landed on his shoulder that pulled him back up.

Raising his brow, Lin Yun asked, “Who the hell do you think you are?”

His voice wasn’t loud, but it was like a bomb that left everyone’s ears buzzing. In the next second, everyone turned to look at Lin Yun.
