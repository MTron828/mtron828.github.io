Chapter 347 - Three Seals Combined

When the ferocious tiger stood up, its crimson fur started to blaze with flames that raised the temperature of the barren land.

A Scarletflame Tiger? Lin Yun frowned his brows. He would usually avoid running into eighth stage overlord demonic beasts. After all, they could easily tear apart a ninth stage ordinary demonic beast, and they could crush mountains with their paws.

For the Scarletflame Tiger, it had fire spiritual energy because of a variation to its bloodline. On top of the variation, this Scarletflame Tiger was no ordinary beast. It was an overlord demonic beast at the pinnacle eighth stage of the Profound Martial Realm and it could reach the ninth stage at any moment. However, it was too late for Lin Yun to leave.

Then again, Lin Yun had no intentions of leaving to begin with. He had been in the Extermination Mountain Range for a month and hadn’t run into an opponent that he could fight with his full strength. So he wanted to try fighting the Scarletflame Tiger.

The Scarletflame Tiger casually swayed left and right, which gave others a misconception that it was oversized. It didn’t immediately charge forward like other demonic beasts would. Rather, it was observing Lin Yun and flexing its demonic aura and pressure. It wanted to use the pressure to make Lin Yun reveal his weaknesses.

Lin Yun also circulated the Iris Sword Sutra within his body and his sword aura started to surge. His aura easily resolved the pressure coming from the tiger. At this moment, a ferocious light flashed in the tiger’s eye. It lowered its head and released an ear-deafening roar that could shake heaven and earth. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

A violent gale swept up into the sky and the blazing heat formed sparks that slowly gathered into a fireball. The fireball was like a meteor and it emitted a terrifyingly high temperature. Lin Yun’s face changed when he saw this. He immediately tapped his foot on the ground and retreated. Meanwhile, he threw his punches at the fireball.

Under the barrage of punches from Lin Yun, the fireball was destroyed. It exploded with flames that spread out into the surroundings. This scene practically looked like the end of the world. Lin Yun now knew why this place was a mess. After all, it made no sense for this place to be perfectly fine if such a battle took place all the time.

A huge shadow covered Lin Yun as the Scarletflame Tiger swung its claws. However, Lin Yun dodged them by spreading his arms apart and executing the Seven Profound Steps. Then, he dove down at the Scarletflame Tiger and threw a few punches.

But before he could fully descend, the powerful wind distorted his face and nearly forced his eyes to close. In the end, Lin Yun was forced to execute the Seven Profound Steps, leaving nine afterimages in the air. But as soon as he retreated, a blazing tail swept towards him.

Lin Yun was shocked when he landed on the ground. He was fortunate that the Seven Profound Steps had reached complete mastery. After all, he would have no idea what would have happened to him if he took that tail head-on.

The Scarletflame Tiger looked at Lin Yun with disdain and let out a roar.

“It looks like I have to get serious.” A cold light flashed in Lin Yun’s eyes. He gathered the origin energy and dracophant energy within his body to form a purple armor around his body. Then another fireball started to descend.

Lin Yun charged into the sky to meet it. When the fireball slammed onto his armor, it merely caused a ripple before the power behind it disappeared. It didn’t bring any trouble to Lin Yun at all. With the Dracophant War Armor, Lin Yun had nothing to fear when facing the Scarletflame Tiger’s attacks.

Raising his hand, Lin Yun threw out a punch. The dracophant energy filled his limbs and he faced the Scarletflame Tiger head-on, without taking any steps back. When the Blackscaled Leopard watched this battle from afar, fear filled its eyes. Clearly, it never expected that Lin Yun would be so powerful that not even an overlord demonic beast could get rid of him. Lin Yun even held the upper hand after he summoned his armor.

A cauldron manifested and the dracophant on the cauldron revolved around Lin Yun. During the violent collision, a war song resounded from the cauldron. Cauldrons were used in ancient ceremonies, so when saints used them as tribute to the heavens, there would usually be phenomena such as the appearance of divine beasts or lightning.

But it was impossible for Lin Yun to create such a phenomena with the Dracophant Battle Physique only at the fourth stage. Lin Yun was having a great time fighting and swinging his punches. His hair was fluttering in the wind and his eyes were sharp like an eagle. He could feel his body being filled with power.

On the other hand, the Scarletflame Tiger was continually being shocked. It felt like there was no bottom to Lin Yun’s energy, especially since the aura coming from Lin Yun was getting stronger. Lin Yun didn’t even look like someone in the seventh stage.

Lin Yun unleashed the Dragon-Tiger Fist and attacks rained down at the Scarletflame Tiger. Under Lin Yun’s punches, the Scarletflame Tiger’s aura actually started to decline and showed signs of collapsing. When Lin Yun unleashed the Hundred Beast Wave, the Scarletflame Tiger was sent flying.

The tiger fell to the ground and rolled around, creating huge craters on the ground. Lin Yun took a few steps forward to stabilize himself. Looking at the Scarletflame Tiger still filled with energy, Lin Yun frowned his brows.

The vitality of an overlord demonic beast was too powerful. An ordinary demonic beast would’ve already died by now. However, the Scarletflame Tiger barely had heavy injuries, so it could still put up a fight.

Since he already came this far, Lin Yun might as well follow through. The Golden Crow Seal appeared behind him and Lin Yun arrived in front of the Scarletflame Tiger.

“Vanquishing Dragon and Tiger!” Lin Yun unleashed the strongest form of the Dragon-Tiger Fist. With the momentum that could vanquish a dragon gathering on his left and the momentum that could vanquish a tiger on his right, Lin Yun was really testing himself. He was almost completely covered by a faint golden light when he pushed the Dragon-Tiger Fist to the limits.

Just as the Scarletflame Tiger got back on its feet, Lin Yun slammed it back down with the Vanquishing Dragon Fist. He then followed that up with the Vanquishing Tiger Fist that sent the Scarletflame Tiger a few hundred meters away.

When the tiger fell to the ground, it wailed out in pain as it was covered with injuries. Lin Yun finally unclenched his fists and the aura around him dissipated.

When the tiger looked at Lin Yun walking over while covered in blood, it had fear in its eyes. But just when it managed to get up on its feet, it collapsed back down and its vitality started to dissipate.

The Blackscaled Leopard that lured Lin Yun over also turned into a black beam and ran off. Lin Yun merely glanced at the leopard before he turned his attention back to the tiger.

But before he could even respond, a claw slammed onto his chest. The Dracophant War Armor instantly broke apart and Lin Yun was sent flying while throwing up a mouthful of blood. Lin Yun could sense the fine cracks on his ribs. When he raised his head, he saw the Scarletflame Tiger getting back up on its feet. But this time, its aura was even more terrifying.

Lin Yun knew that the Scarletflame Tiger made a breakthrough. It made a breakthrough when facing death. It disregarded the injuries on its body and let out a deep roar while looking at Lin Yun.

Then, the tiger started running over. It only took a few breaths before it traveled a thousand meters and arrived before Lin Yun. When the terrifying pressure descended, it suffocated Lin Yun and caused him to spit up a little blood before his breathing became smooth.

Looking at the Scarletflame Tiger dashing over, Lin Yun’s eyes blazed with fighting spirit, “You want to kill me? I’m afraid that you’re still not capable of doing that!”

Lin Yun suddenly unleashed a terrifying aura. His aura changed several times. First, it surged like flames from a blazing fire. Then, it exuded heroic might as it became fearless. Finally, his aura became domineering as he turned into a golden light.

Lin Yun let out a deep roar and he soared into the sky. When he overlapped three seals together, his body was filled with a violent energy that nearly ripped his body apart. But he wasn’t concerned with that and suppressed the violent energy within his body.

Just when the Scarletflame Tiger’s attack was about to reach him, Lin Yun pushed the three combined seals out. There wasn’t any earth-shattering momentum when it did this. Rather, it was like a sword aura that silently turned the Scarletflame Tiger into a cloud of blood.

He stood quietly while he looked at the cloud of blood raining down on him. Then, he stretched his hand out and grabbed the Scarletflame Tiger’s beast core.
