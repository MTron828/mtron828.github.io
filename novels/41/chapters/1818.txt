Chapter 1819 - Hold On

Lin Yun took a quick glance at Yan Chihuo and Yu Wenxiu. They were both at the pinnacle of the third stage Profound Life Stage. He roughly calculated the time, and it had just been three months since the Martial Dao Tea Party. Back then, there were rumors that these people reached the third stage Profound Life Stage when they made a breakthrough to the Samsara Edict Realm.

Now that he looked at them again, the rumors weren’t fake. He could sense the powerful dragon origin coming from them, and they were even stronger than the Liu Saint Clan’s elders he slew.

When Yan Chihuo looked at Lin Yun, his gaze was complicated. Lin Yun could no longer catch his attention, but he couldn’t help feeling some regret. After all, he was forced to make a breakthrough because he had no hope of competing for first on the Dragon Pulse Ranking.

“Lin Xiao, I never expected to see you here, and even I have to admit that I’m struggling to contain the temptation of taking your head.” Yan Chihuo smiled, half-jokingly with a smile on his face. After all, the Demonfeather Order could be exchanged for almost anything, and it was at least a Glory Saint Artifact.

Not only was he tempted, but even saints would be tempted. But as a holy land’s genius, he naturally wouldn’t be as shameless as Kou Tianhua. But he was probing when he said it in a half-joking tone. If Lin Yun was a pushover, he wouldn’t mind making a move. After all, who could refuse a Glory Saint Artifact?

“Haha. This is the Black Tortoise Void Sea. If the Nirvana Banquet’s champion dies here, I believe the Azure Dragon’s lineage and Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain won’t be surprised about it.” Yu Wenxiu’s cold voice resounded.

When Lin Yun raised his head, he noticed Huang Xuanyi was also there. He was insignificantly standing beside Yu Wenxiu, and Lin Yun didn’t notice him earlier. Lin Yun couldn’t help being stunned for a moment when he saw Huang Xuanyi, since this was their third meeting. But now that he recalled, his luck seemed to be pretty good whenever he ran into Huang Xuanyi.

When he first blinded Huang Xuanyi, he became first on the Elysium Core Ranking. During their second meeting, he blinded Huang Xuanyi again and became famous at the West Garden Banquet. This was their third meeting, and he noticed Huang Xuanyi had a black cloth covering his eyes. It appears that he has yet to recover his sight.

“You’re right. On the contrary, I believe no one will be surprised either if the holy lands’ disciples die here.” Lin Yun indifferently replied.

Yu Wenxiu’s pupils flashed with a peculiar light, but he deeply hid it and merely brushed it off with a smile.

“Lin Xiao, it looks like your head is pretty valuable. So many people are after you.” Kou Tianhua laughed when he noticed the peculiar relationship between Lin Yun and the two holy lands.

Yan Chihuo and Yu Wenxiu furrowed their brows when they heard that. They ultimately decided to ignore Kou Tianhuo because of their identity, but they didn’t stand with Lin Yun either.

“Lin Xiao, you can come with us.” Right then, a hearty laugh resounded as the Divine Phoenix Mountain’s Ji Lingfeng and Heavenly Dao Sect’s Xiao Yuanqi came together. There were many holy land disciples following beside them, and they stood on Lin Yun’s side without any hesitation when they arrived.

“It has been a long time since we last met, and you two have made great improvements.” Lin Yun was surprised while looking at Ji Lingfeng and Xiao Yuanqi. After all, they both reached the fourth stage Profound Life Stage. They were just at the third stage Profound Life Stage two months ago.

“Isn’t it because of you? As Long as you’re around, we won’t be able to stand out on the Dragon Pulse Ranking!” Ji Lingfeng smiled.

Strictly speaking, he was first on the Dragon Pulse Ranking for two years, and he received a lot of benefits during this time. The invisible fortune gave him a lot of help, allowing him to possess a foundation that far surpassed those in the same generation.

Although Lin Yun stole his position as first on the Dragon Pulse Ranking, Ji Lingfeng didn’t hold a grudge against him, unlike Yu Wenxiu and Yan Chihuo.

“Brother Feng, you must be joking.” Lin Yun humbly smiled.

“You ran into trouble?” When Heavenly Dao Sect’s Xiao Yuanqi glanced at Kou Tianhua. He said, “You can travel with us when the palace opens. He won’t dare to touch you, then. Others might fear him, but not us.”

That was indeed the case. When Kou Tianhua’s group of three saw Xiao Yuanqi and Ji Lingfeng, they immediately shut their mouths. They were especially baffled why as to Ji Lingfeng and Xiao Yuanqi had no grudges against Lin Yun, especially when he stepped on their heads to rise on the Dragon Pulse Ranking.

“Young Master, what should we do now?” Yuan Hengying asked.

“We’re not in a hurry. There are too many holy land disciples here. We’ll find an opportunity in the underground palace. I don’t believe we won’t be able to find an opportunity.” Kou Tianhua said.

Right then, the Myriad Lightning Sect’s Yi Feng and Divine Dao Sect’s Lin Qingyang arrived. With that, almost everyone in the top ten was here, and many of them were defeated by Lin Yun. But the situation had changed now because they made their breakthroughs to the Samsara Edict Realm. Not only did they undergo a transformation, but they have undergone a great boost in their cultivation and secret techniques.

This was how most cultivation techniques worked. They wouldn’t have been able to make a breakthrough without reaching a certain degree. A breakthrough in a bigger realm gave them a great boost in their cultivation.

After seeing Lin Yun, they all wore weird expressions, and their thoughts became complicated.

“Lin Xiao actually dares to come to the Black Tortoise Void Sea when he’s only at the Dragon Pulse Realm?”

“Everyone here has reached the Profound Life Stage, and there are so many demonic cultivators here. This won’t be a peaceful spar like the Martial Dao Tea Party.”

“If he follows Ji Lingfeng and Xiao Yuanqi, won’t he be a burden to them?” Based on Lin Yun’s fame, it was inevitable for him to be the center of discussion. After discussing for a while, their eyes fell onto the Heavenly Thunder Palace that was wrapped in nine-colored lightning.

Their eyes were full of greed. After all, this place was the Black Tortoise’s inheritance ground, and the opportunities here weren’t simple. It would be great if they could obtain any harvests. If they could obtain a cultivation or secret technique, they would be able to soar to the sky. As more people arrived, this relatively peaceful place gradually became chaotic.

Suddenly, a ripple appeared from the nine-colored lightning that wrapped around the Heavenly Thunder Palace, with a terrifying aura spreading out. This made everyone’s faces change, and they couldn’t help retreating. The nine-colored lightning was like shackles slowly loosening up. In the end, they intertwined together before forming a lotus beneath the Heavenly Thunder Palace.

In the next moment, a loud sound echoed, and the Heavenly Thunder Palace gradually descended onto the sea, and a bronze gate reaching a thousand feet slowly opened under the lightning.

“The gates are opened!”

“It’s really the Black Tortoise’s inheritance! There is a Black Tortoise engraved on the gates!”

“Holy shit! We’re here at the right time now!” Everyone had flames in their pupils, and this instantly made everyone’s breathing become heavy. They all felt that the dangers they had faced along the way were worth it.

After the Heavenly Thunder Palace’s gates gradually opened, everyone couldn’t wait any longer and charged into the palace. This group of people pushed their movement techniques to the limit, and the speed they executed was shocking.

“Lin Xiao, come together with us.” Ji Lingfeng and Xiao Yuanqi said.

“No need. I’ll be fine with Senior Gu around.” Lin Yun declined their offer and even dragged Gu Jun out.

“Him?” Xiao Yuanqi and Ji Lingfeng looked at Gu Jun suspiciously. But they knew they couldn’t force Lin Yun. Not to mention they also had their companions, and they would lack behind just because of Lin Yun. “Alright, then.”

After everyone left, Gu Jun complained, “How am I a senior?”

An Liuyan covered her mouth and chuckled. She said, “Elder Gu, you don’t have to be modest at all. We’ll be relying on you in the Black Tortoise Void Sea.”

“Let’s go or it’ll be too late for us!” Mei Zihua was excited. He came from a prestigious clan and was pampered since young. So he had never seen such a spectacular scene before, and he already couldn’t hold himself down.

“Be careful.” Lin Yun said with his eyes squinted. His Sword Heart could sense a wisp of danger inside the gates. But they had to go no matter what, with no risk, no gain.

Just like that, the group of four charged through the ancient bronze gate with shock in their pupils. They swiftly passed through the gate and entered the Heavenly Thunder Palace. But the moment they entered, the dazzling lightning made them shut their eyes.

“Not good!” Lin Yun’s face changed, and his Sword Heart was buzzing. He could sense a dangerous premonition.

Opening his eyes, Lin Yun executed the Divine Dragon Eyes with a sun and a moon blooming in his pupils with the Blue Dragon, Golden Dragon, and Silver Dragon Seals forming into three lumps of flames coiling around the sun and moon.

He could see lightning condensing into multiple people at the far end of the passage, and those people had a pair of lightning wings behind them. They were all suspended in the air with dazzling lightning flames blooming in their palms.

In the next moment, the densely packed people all raised their hands and indiscriminately unleashed the lightning flames. This caused a series of explosions, and the space in this region began to distort with a destructive power sweeping out.

The commotion was too great. The first group of people fell for it the moment they came in. They were covered in purple flames, and even the saint armor they wore began to melt under the intense temperature. This made them scream out in pain, but nothing they did could extinguish the flames.

“The Profound Thunder Sacred Flame!” Gu Jun was shocked, and his face changed. “That’s the Profound Thunder Sacred Flame. Don’t try to resist with your dragon origin because it will enter your body through the dragon origin. Just use your physique or artifacts to endure it head-on.”

The flames were terrifying, but no one here was a pushover. They swiftly came to their senses and avoided the incoming attacks or faced them head-on. They all executed their various means to deal with the Profound Thunder Sacred Flame and carried on.

There were those who fell for it, and even top-tiered experts at the fourth stage Profound Life Stage would fall. As for those who were struck with the Profound Thunder Sacred Flame, no one cared about them and even knocked them away so that they wouldn’t be caught by the flames.CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“I-Isn’t this a little too cruel?” Mei Zhihua could feel a chill run down his spine when he saw this scene.

“Old man, do something.” Lin Yun turned to look at Gu Jun. The Profound Thunder Sacred Flame was too bizarre, and he didn’t dare to gamble with his life.

“What do you want me to do? Just hold on for a while because the sacred flames will ultimately extinguish at some point.” Gu Jun said, and he took out a shield forged with a tortoiseshell hiding in a corner.

Seeing this, Lin Yun, An Liuyan, and Mei Zihua quickly followed behind him and hid behind the shield. They had to admit that the tortoiseshell was pretty sturdy because it actually took the Profound Thunder Sacred Flame head-on. They hid behind the tortoiseshell in fear, and they also didn’t dare to force their way in.
