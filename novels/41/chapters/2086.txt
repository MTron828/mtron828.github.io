Chapter 2087: Didn't You Say...

This large-scale chaotic battle ended with the Blood Word Battalion’s arrival. This was something that no one had expected. Many people felt that the battle couldn’t be stopped with the fall of Zhao Wuji. It was just a matter of time before a Saint from the Black Plume Palace joined the battle.

Since this battle concerned the ownership of the Sovereign Saint Sword, it might have developed into an official confrontation between two holy lands. With the Heavenly Dao Sect’s foundation, they definitely wouldn’t be as simple as they looked, and they must have had their trump cards.

If a Saint from the Black Plume Palace joined the battle, the Heavenly Dao Sect’s counterattack would appear, and a saint battle would be unavoidable. But no one expected that the battle would end in this manner.

Along with Su Ziyao and the Blood Word Battalion’s arrival, the protagonist of this battle, Ye Qingtian, had left. This naturally made the faces of Black Plume Palace’s Quasi-Saints ashen and furious, but they could do nothing but watch Ye Qingtian leave. Ye Qingtian was riding the same horse as the Ninth Princess, and not even a Saint would dare to move against him now, not to mention Quasi-Saints like them.

“Damn it! How did Ye Qingtian become acquainted with the Ninth Princess?!”

“Isn’t it too much of a coincidence?!”

“Is there nothing we can do?” They were naturally unwilling to see Ye Qingtian leave. The Black Plume Palace was the overlord of the Northern Ridge, but they didn’t have the guts to have a falling out with the Divine Dragon Empire. The Divine Dragon Empire was a colossus beyond their imagination. The nine emperors appeared three thousand years ago, and they had become myths as they swept through the Kunlun Realm.

“He’s leaving just like that?” The Indigothunder Peak Master looked at this scene with disbelief because he didn’t expect this.

“I have no idea,” Mu Chuan shook his head. He also wasn’t clear about the relationship between Lin Yun and Su Ziyao. Perhaps only Ye Ziling knew, but Ye Ziling naturally wouldn’t tell him about it.

Right then, saint aura descended as a saint appeared with black wings behind him, landing amongst the Black Plume Palace’s party.

Upon seeing this person, all the elders and disciples of the Black Plume Palace quickly bowed, “We pay our greetings to Piercing Yang Saint Lord!”

This saint was the saint stationed at Nether Ethereal City as the Black Plume Palace’s representative. This saint looked furious because he was the trump card in this battle, and he had been observing in the dark, preparing to seize the Sovereign Saint Sword if the situation looked bad. He was endlessly close to becoming a Saint Sovereign, with nearly a thousand years of cultivation.

“Saint Lord!” Everyone from the Black Plume Palace beamed joyfully when they saw Piercing Yang Saint Lord’s arrival. After all, there might be a turning point in this matter with the arrival of a Saint Lord, and he might be able to snatch Ye Qingtian from Su Ziyao. This was a huge risk, but who knew if the Piercing Yang Saint Lord might take the risk?

Even if he couldn’t make a move against Ye Qingtian, he could capture those from the Heavenly Dao Sect and Sword Sect to force Ye Qingtian to return.

“Saint Lord!” They looked excited, wanting to request the Saint Lord to make a move.

But the Piercing Yang Saint Lord suddenly threw out a mouthful of blood when he appeared and staggered. This shocked everyone from the Black Plume Palace, and they quickly rushed to support him.

“Haha! The Saint Lord of the Black Plume Palace isn’t that bad to endure for so long after taking my palm.” A burst of laughter resounded as a black-haired woman appeared. She was enveloped in a dazzling saint radiance that instantly made her the center of attention when she appeared.

Gu Zijing and Jiang Yunting were shocked because they recognized this mysterious woman from the Hidden Sword Manor who even disregarded Feng Wuji. So she was here to help Ye Qingtian?

“Get lost,” Feng Yu said bluntly. “If you dare to go after the Sovereign Saint Sword again, don’t blame me for tearing apart the Black Plume Palace’s branch within Nether Ethereal City.”

Those from the Black Plume Palace were aggrieved. They wanted to step forth and ask this woman where she got the courage to tear down their branch.

“She’s a Saint Sovereign… Leave immediately!” The Piercing Yang Saint Lord stopped them and didn’t dare to stay there for another second as he panically left with the Black Plume Palace’s party.

While everyone from the Black Plume Palace left in such a pathetic manner, the other ten holy lands present felt ashamed as they quietly left, not wanting to stay here for another second. This battle was destined to be a laughingstock, and they became Ye Qingtian’s laughingstock. After this battle, Ye Qingtian’s name was bound to spread throughout the Kunlun Realm, and no one could stop his rise.

“I’m grateful for the Sword Sect’s help,” the Indigothunder Peak Master expressed his gratitude to Mu Chuan.

Mu Chuan smiled, “We’re all from the Eastern Desolation, so there’s no need to be so polite. Let’s hurry up and catch up to them. Ye Qingtian should be heading to the Sacred Alliance as well.”

“Yeah.” They immediately left and chased after the Black Word Battalion.

As everything settled down, the spectators also began to disperse. Everything happened and ended quickly, with the Sovereign Saint Sword taken away by Ye Qingtian.

A long time later, a white-haired middle-aged man descended from the sky. He wore a strange robe with a necklace made of bones around his neck. He also carried a white bone blade on his back, giving off a terrifying ominous aura with terrifying flames blazing within his pupils. This person was one of the seven saints of the Eastern Desolation’s Black Mountain, the White Bone Blade Saint.

“He’s really lucky to have been saved by the Ninth Princess,” the White Bone Blade Saint muttered.

Right then, two figures descended from the sky and looked at the White Bone Blade Saint without any emotions on their faces.

The White Bone Blade Saint smiled, “The Heavenly Dao Sect think too highly of me to send two great saints to keep an eye on me.”

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint and Serene Dust Great Saint were standing before the White Bone Blade Saint. They had arrived long ago, but they’d been watching in the dark because they didn’t want to cause an uproar.

“Since when did the White Bone Blade Saint become Tian Xuanzi’s lackey?” The Serene Dust Great Saint asked coldly. They received news that Tian Xuanzi sent an expert from the Eastern Desolation, planning to seize the Sovereign Saint Sword.

The White Bone Blade Saint smiled, “The seven saints of the Black Mountain have a friendship of more than two hundred years with Tian Xuanzi. Our friendship is greater than the favor of the Heavenly Dao Sect, so don’t misunderstand.”

“Don’t meddle in this matter,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said coldly.

“Meddle in what?” The White Bone Blade Saint asked with a playful smile.

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint squinted with murderous intent boiling within her eyes.

“Women are really scary, wanting to fight before making things clear. I’ll be leaving,” the White Bone Blade Saint smiled and soared to the sky, before quickly leaving this place.

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint and Serene Dust Great Saint looked at the White Bone Blade Saint. They didn’t make a move because the seven saints of the Black Mountain were terrifying existences within the Eastern Desolation. So they wouldn’t fight if they had a choice.

“You go after them. I’m not relieved with that lass from the Divine Dragon Empire,” the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint said. “I’ll make a trip to the Hidden Sword Manor.”

The Serene Dust Great Saint nodded. It was beyond their expectations that the Ninth Princess would suddenly appear and seem to have an ambiguous relationship with Lin Yun. That’s why one of them had to make a trip over in case something might happen. One also had to visit the Hidden Sword Manor to appease that old man since they were borrowing the Sovereign Saint Sword.

The commotion created by Lin Yun was great, and even they?didn’t expect him to cause such a huge uproar during the Sword Assembly.

In short, Lin Yun had greatly embarrassed the Hidden Sword Manor, and the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint had to clean up for him, lest things get out of hand. The Hidden Sword Manor could disregard Lin Yun, but they had to give the Heavenly Jade Sword Saint face when she visits them.

The horse that Lin Yun and Su Ziyao rode galloped swiftly. The horse was so fast that even Quasi-Saints couldn’t reach such a fast speed. When they could faintly see the outline of a city at the far end of the horizon, the horse finally stopped.

“Ziyao, why are you here?” Lin Yun asked.

“I’ve been at the Southern Border. I heard about what happened during the Sword Assembly a few days ago and guessed that it might be you. So I came to look, and it turned out I’m right.” Su Ziyao leaned against Lin Yun’s chest. When the wind blew her hair, her hair would flutter against Lin Yun’s face.

“How did you know it’s me?” Lin Yun asked.

“You’re asking for a beating.” Su Ziyao slapped the back of Lin Yun’s hand, producing a loud sound. This briefly stunned him before he smiled and caressed the part she hit. Su Ziyao then explained, “You have my hair on your finger, so I can recognize you no matter where you are or what form you take.”

Lin Yun awkwardly smiled and grabbed onto Su Ziyao’s hand. He smiled, “I’m just testing you.”

It might have been a long time since they’d last met, but there wasn’t any barrier between them. They didn’t look like an ordinary couple and seemed more intimate than any couple. Many words were hidden within their hearts, and they understood what each other thought without saying anything. This was a rapport, just like how Lin Yun was inseparable from the Flower Burial Sword. But in his relationship with Su Ziyao, he was willing to become the sword in her hand.

“We’re here, so you can get down now.” Su Ziyao grabbed the leash and looked at the majestic city that was up ahead. This was Sacred Thunder City, the main city of the Sacred Alliance at the Southern Border. This city had a teleportation array that could help people travel between domains.

“You’re not coming with me?” Lin Yun was unwilling to part with Su Ziyao and held her even tighter.

“I still have to deal with a Voodoo Cult, si I’m in a hurry.” Su Ziyao turned around, and her face was close to Lin Yun.

Seeing Su Ziyao, there was no change to Lin Yun’s face, but his heart was throbbing violently because she was too beautiful. But before he could respond, Su Ziyao gave Lin Yun a peck on his lips before biting down. She was ruthless with her bite, causing Lin Yun’s lips to bleed. When Lin Yun was in pain, he was thrown off the horse by Su Ziyao.

Lin Yun spun and hovered in mid-air. When he touched the blood on his lips, he showed a helpless smile. He asked, “You’re not going to send me off?”

Su Ziyao smiled, “Didn’t you say that a man’s heart should be as cold as steel, and women would only affect the speed of you drawing your sword?”

Lin Yun was stunned when he replied, “I didn’t say the second part.”

“It’s the same. Don’t think you’re impressive just because you killed an Indigo Origin Phase Quasi-Saint. I can kill a hundred of them. There’s nothing impressive about Indigo Origin Phase Quasi-Saints once you step into dao.”

The corner of Lin Yun’s lips twitched because he was being looked down on.

“Reach the Quasi-Saint Realm quickly. I’ll come find you at that time and give you a present,” Su Ziyao said. She suddenly recalled something and turned around, “Don’t miss me because you know I’ll definitely miss you.”
