Chapter 1007 - Holy Spirit Martial Technique

The entrance of the Azure Dragon Palace was a profound gate formed with flames. Those who couldn’t go through the gate were observing the gate for a month. They wanted to see who would come out.

Suddenly, a stream of cultivators started to charge out of the gate. They were the ones who made it to the Azure Dragon Plaza. When Luo Chen’s group came out, their appearance caused an uproar. It was clear to see that everyone who was exiting the gate had made it to the end. The only thing left was to find out who obtained the opportunity above fortune.

Many people’s gazes fell on Luo Chen because they thought he obtained the opportunity. After all, he was the chief of the seven heads. At the same time, the crowd noticed that four of the seven heads didn’t come out of the gate, which could mean that they were dead. But before they could finish speculating, Luo Chen’s group left. It seemed like they weren’t the ultimate winner.

After Luo Chen’s group left, the other cultivators started to explain what happened in the Azure Dragon Plaza. No one could believe that Lin Yun killed Mu Xiuhan’s group. They also couldn’t believe that Yu Haotian suppressed Luo Chen’s group before Lin Yun ultimately defeated the former. All in all, Lin Yun obtained the opportunity above fortune, killed the demonic spirit possessing Yu Haotian, and became the ultimate winner in the Azure Dragon Realm.

Lin Yun was already famous in the Azure Dragon Region as a comet that shined brightly in the sky. But no one had ever compared him with the seven heads. So when the outcome was announced, everyone had to evaluate their thoughts.

An hour later, golden flames erupted from the ancient gate as a golden crow appeared. Then, when the light dissipated, Lin Yun appeared before everyone with his sword box on his back.

“Lin Yun is out!”

“What a powerful aura! Did he really obtain the opportunity above fortune?”

“Mu Xiuhan’s group were really killed? Unbelievable. How did he manage to do it all by himself?” Doubt and awe were expressed as everyone stared at Lin Yun.

When Lin Yun appeared, he ignored the crowd and stared at the flaming gate. The gate showed no signs of dissipating, which meant that it wouldn’t be closing anytime soon. Gathering himself, Lin Yun executed the Nine Golden Crow Transformations and left.

With his huge harvest, it was wise to leave. He needed to find somewhere remote to comprehend his harvest. Plus, he needed to merge the Divine Glorysun Fist and Divine Glorymoon Fist. Once he did that, he could look into the Glorysun Spirit and Glorymoon Spirit.

He estimated that he would need at least ten days to comprehend everything. Half a day later, Lin Yun and Lil’ Red arrived at a serene valley right before nightfall. The valley belonged to a fourth soul Heavenly Soul Realm overlord demonic beast that Lil’ Red easily killed.

After Lin Yun confirmed that there was no one within a hundred mile radius, he took out Yu Haotian’s interspatial pouch. His eyes were filled with expectation, “Time to see what treasures he had…”

With a simple shake, Lin Yun proceeded to pour everything out of the interspatial pouch. In the next second, golden light shined as Divine Astral Pellets blazing with flames appeared on the ground. Looking at the pile of treasures, Lin Yun was truly shocked, “Wow, that fellow is really lucky…”

Lin Yun started with 10,000 Divine Astral Pellets and barely had any left. So it was a pleasant surprise to find all the DIvine Astral Pellets in Yu Haotian’s insterpatial pouch. Lin Yun counted at least 8,000 of them. Clearly, Yu Haotian got lucky after he ran away. Otherwise, he wouldn’t dare to face the likes of Luo Chen.

Lin Yun couldn’t help exclaiming at Yu Haotian’s luck before he wore a smile, “But they’re all mine now.”

Without any hesitation, Lin Yun put all the Divine Astral Pellets in his interspatial pouch with excitement. After all, he used up most of his Divine Astral Pellets in his tribulations. He was wondering where he would get more, so this was truly a blessing.

“The Indigomoon Sutra, the Overlord Sword Sutra, the Phaseless Demonic Art, and the movement technique from the Azure Dragon Palace… Wait, this seems to be a secret technique from the Indigomoon Elysium! No wonder their cultivation technique can absorb the origin energy of others. What a bizarre technique! What?! This bottle has saint elixirs… it's the Bloodflame Pellet!”

Lin Yun was shocked by Yu Haotian’s collection. Some of the treasures belonged to the Indigomoon Elysium, but most of them came from his fortune in the Heavenly Path or by killing others. Furthermore, there were five Bloodflame Pellets with saint runes imprinted on them. Clearly, they were refined by a saint spiritualist. They could be used to quickly recover from injuries even if all the bones were smashed into pieces.

But their biggest effect was tempering the body because the Bloodflame Pellets were refined with the bones and blood essence of demonic beasts. The demonic beasts used for the pellets were related to the ancient demonic beasts such as the Golden Crow, Azure Bird, and Phoenix.

Even if one grasped saint runes and the recipe, there was still the issue of low success rates. Lin Yun had studied spiritual runes back in the Heavenly Province Academy, so he was able to recognize the Bloodflame pellets. Perhaps Yu Haotian had no idea how precious this bottle of pellets was. Otherwise, he would’ve refined it a lot earlier to boost his strength.

“Well, it’s all mine now. I can’t speed up my cultivation in the Azure Dragon Saint Art by relying on the Divine Astral Pellets.” Lin Yun grinned in satisfaction. As he continued to examine his harvest, he found many overlord demonic beast’s beast cores, which he tossed at Lil’ Red.

After all, there were too many treasures for Lin Yun to enjoy by himself. Suddenly, he saw a jade slip glowing with silver light. The jade slip emitted a sacred and ancient aura, which instantly drew his attention.

“Divine Glorymoon Fist!” Lin Yun’s heart began to throb violently because he was confident that this was the Divine Glorymoon Fist. Without any hesitation, he placed the slip on his forehead, allowing the massive amounts of information to start flowing into his mind.

After a long time passed, Lin Yun let go of the jade slip with deep joy flashing in the depth of his pupils. It was just as he had expected, there were similarities between the Divine Glorymoon Fist and Divine Glorysun Fist. This meant that he could combine them together to create a martial technique above fortune. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Essentially, the Azure Dragon Saint Art wasn’t a martial technique above fortune. The opportunity above fortune was in reference to the Azure Dragon True Bone. But the Divine Solar Lunar Fist wasn’t the same because it was a genuine martial technique above fortune.

“A martial technique transcending fortune. I heard they were called Holy Spirit Martial Techniques in the past,” said Lin Yun with a grave expression. A martial technique of this grade was no longer a simple attacking technique, but one that consisted of law and divinity. In ancient times, those with such martial techniques would be revered as deities.

“Yu Haotian, you’re really my lucky star. This is such an unbelievable opportunity.” Lin Yun took a deep breath with interest flashing in the depth of his pupils. The Divine Glorymoon Fist was greater than he could have imagined.

An hour later, Lin Yun finally managed to sort out his harvest. He was exhausted by the amount of treasure he had to go through. From this factor alone, one could tell how many treasures Yu Haotian had. Then again, there would be more treasures for Yu Haotian if he defeated Lin Yun. After all, there was the Indigoflame Thunderwhip and dragon clan wine.

“It’s a headache if my fortune is too great. I need time to sort everything out,” smiled Lin Yun bitterly. If Luo Chen and the others heard him, they would vomit blood out of anger.
