Chapter 901 - Dumbfounded

A dazzling crimson brilliance blinded Lin Yun when the chest box was opened. Lin Yun’s spiritual sword intent couldn’t even compare to the radiance inside the box. The spiritual energy was so dense that it instantly permeated the hall.

When he breathed, Lin Yun could sense dense spiritual energy entering his body and nourishing every single cell. At the same time, a terrifying surge of astral energy filled every corner of the hall. It was Lin Yun’s first time seeing such an astronomical sum of astral energy in the Heavenly Path.

Lin Yun's eyes adjusted to the brightness and he could see pellets the size of an infant’s fist. Each pellet was engraved with flaming runes filled with spirituality. The runes were similar to astral energy in the starry sky and looked like stars instead of pellets.

“Astral pellets?” With great difficulty, Lin Yun managed to calm down. The pellets looked like astral pellets, but they were a lot bigger than usual. At the same time, the astral energy that they contained was a lot stronger than normal. Most importantly, he could tell that the flaming runes weren’t ordinary.

“They should be astral pellets…” Lin Yun took out his astral pellets and compared them. They had a different look and different quality. The astral pellets refined in the Heavenly Path were the size of a nail and anything bigger would be full of impurities.

At this moment, the name ‘Divine Astral Pellet’ appeared in his mind, which made his breathing speed up. Lin Yun had heard about divine astral pellets occasionally from Fang Shaoyu as astral pellets refined by empyreans in the Heavenly Path.

The astral pellets that Lin Yun could refine were crude because he could only extract the astral energy from the atmosphere. However, true empyreans could directly refine astral energy from the stars in the sky. It was a huge difference. Furthermore, the astral pellets refined by geniuses in the Heavenly Path had to be refined to origin energy and not astral energy.

Empyreans, however, could easily refine astral pellets even if they weren’t in the Heavenly Path. It was just easier for them to refine divine astral pellets in the Heavenly Path.

To refine a divine astral pellet, empyreans had to extract astral energy from the stars and refine them with astral flames. Furthermore, it was a lot harder to attract astral flames in the Kunlun Realm than the Heavenly Path.

In ancient times, before the Heavenly Path broke into pieces, empyreans could easily come to Heavenly Path to refine divine astral pellets. But after the Heavenly Path was split into nine sections, it was closed most of the time. It became harder for people to refine the divine astral pellets and they could only resort to refining ordinary astral pellets.

“Divine astral pellets!” Lin Yun’s gaze changed because they were a rare find in the Heavenly Path according to Fang Shaoyu. Every time they appeared, they would draw everyone’s attention and create a huge battle for ownership. A single divine astral pellet was equivalent to over ten thousand astral pellets.

Then again, there was no way they were comparable in value. One could easily obtain a million astral pellets, but they would need to rely on luck to obtain one divine astral pellets.

A suction force exploded from Lin Yun’s palm, as he grabbed a divine astral pellet. Sensing the blazing astral energy, Lin Yun’s heart throbbed violently.

“The astral energy is extremely pure and refined. The ones I refined are like mud compared to this one. Even if someone offered me a hundred thousand astral pellets for a single divine astral pellet, there’s no way I would make the trade.” Lin Yun calmed down and placed the divine astral pellets back.

He noticed that a hundreth of the astral energy had already leaked out. Because of the boundless astral energy in the divine astral pellet, the astral energy was constantly being neutralized by the atmosphere.

This meant that he had to seal them with spiritual talismans or else the divine astral pellets would become ordinary astral pellets as time passed. Without hesitation, Lin Yun quickly shut the chests and sealed them once more with spiritual talismans before he felt relieved.CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Glancing around at the hundreds of chests, Lin Yun couldn’t help taking a deep breath. Do all of these chests contain divine astral pellets? A single chest had about a hundred divine astral pellets, so he had stumbled onto at least 10,000 based on the chests.

Lil’ Red didn’t hesitate to open the remaining chest boxes and discovered that all of them contained divine astral pellets. Lin Yun and Lil’ Red were dumbfounded. But when Lin Yun recovered from his shock and discovered that the astral energy was leaking out, Lin Yun quickly yelled, “Move them all!”

Lin Yun and Lil’ Red sealed all the chests once again and started putting them away. Occasionally, they would exchange a smiling glance. They were so satisfied with their harvest that even someone like Lin Yun couldn’t maintain his composure, not to mention Lil’ Red.

In the blink of an eye, the duo had removed all of the chests. When they were done, Lil’ Red took a deep breath and sucked all the astral energy in the atmosphere into its stomach. When Lil’ Red opened its eyes, it patted its stomach in satisfaction.

But that wasn’t all as Lil’ Red even snatched the mat that the demonic corpse was sitting on as well as other miscellaneous items in the hall. In a matter of seconds, the main hall was emptied.

Looking at Lil’ Red with disdain, Lin Yun said, “Let’s go to the second level!”

The Hidden Treasure Pavilion had three levels in total. They were only in the first level, so who knew what kind of treasures awaited them in the second level. If the first level was for establishing the foundation of a clan, the second level must be for the geniuses of the clan.

Lil’ Red looked around and searched the demonic corpse just when they were about to leave. When it took out a dagger from the corpse, Lin Yun’s lips twitched as he saw how foul the dagger was.

The corpse was already torn into so many pieces, but Lil’ Red actually managed to find a treasure from the corpse. When Lil’ Red took out the dagger, an eerie light lit up the entire hall and the sharpness emitted out from it made Lil’ Red’s eyelid twitch.

“Dao artifact?” Lin Yun was surprised because he was sure that it was a dao artifact. Perhaps it might not be comparable to his Indigoflame Thunderwhip, but it was a suitable weapon for Lil’ Red.

Looking at the dagger, Lil’ Red couldn’t help meowing as it chuckled. It seemed to have forgotten that it was still in the Dragon-blooded Cat form. So its laughter turned out to be comical. When Lil’ Red noticed its laughter, it quickly stopped laughing and couldn’t help looking depressed.

“Haha, let’s go!” Lin Yun laughed and took the lead while Lil’ Red spat out an interspatial pouch to store the dagger.

As for Chen Qiong and Xian Yunzhen, they were doing their best to kill the endless demonic corpses. Although there were a lot of demonic corpses, they were still geniuses from higher realms. So it didn’t take much effort for them to butcher all the demonic corpses.

Suddenly, they both came to a stop with shock in their pupils. “Do you smell that?”

“Divine astral pellets!” The two of them could sense the aura that belonged to divine astral pellets.

“This is too much. Just how many are there to create such a dense aura?!” As geniuses from higher realms, they had naturally seen divine astral pellets before. So they could guess the number by just sensing the aura.

“Looks like the main hall isn’t far away. If that’s really the case, then we’ll be rich!” Chen Qiong’s eyes blazed with excitement.

On the other hand, Xian Yunzhen was more composed, but the fire in his pupils had betrayed his thoughts. But compared to Chen Qiong’s exaggerated expression, he was more controlled and smiled, “Do you think Lin Yun is still alive?”

“Yunzhen, it looks like you have a deep grudge with him. He should be alive. We should get there first anyway and take everything away. It will be fun watching his expression when he sees that all of his hard work was for nothing,” smiled Chen Qiong.

Hearing that, Xian Yunzhen laughed, “Let’s go then!”

With a flash, they charged towards the main hall emotionally. Just how many divine astral pellets were there in the main hall? Dozens? Hundreds? Or tens of thousands?!

Even as geniuses from higher realms, they couldn’t maintain their composure. But when they entered the main hall, both their faces had frozen. The main hall was empty and a small aura lingered in the atmosphere that proved that the divine astral pellets were once here.

“H-h-how is this possible?!” Chen Qiong was completely dumbfounded when he saw the empty main hall.

Even Xian Yunzhen’s face had become nasty before he gnashed his teeth, “Lin Yun! It must have been him!”
