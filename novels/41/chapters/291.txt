Chapter 292 - Who's Zhong Yunxiao?

Everyone was surprised by how Lin Yun surpassed all the contenders. Even Gu Feiyun who was in the lead earlier was shocked. But the reality of the situation was clear as day and he didn’t have a choice but to believe in it.

“You dare to snatch my Imperial Sword Herb? You’re courting death!” Gu Feiyun swung his greatsword. For a moment, his sword even broke apart the pressure coming from the Imperial Sword Herb.

“It’s the Shattercloud Sword!” Many people exclaimed when they saw this attack. Gu Feiyun was ranked in the top twenty and he was famed for the explosive power in his force. After all, there wasn’t even a single cultivator who could receive his sword earlier. It didn’t matter if it was Nie Tian, Han Feng, Xiao Feng, or Wei Songhan, none of them were confident in receiving his sword.

If they had to face Gu Feiyun, they either had to take advantage of their numbers or wait for Gu Feiyun to be exhausted. Gu Feiyun’s sword was directed at Lin Yun and Lin Yun didn’t even have the time to turn around.

“Kill him!” Xiao Feng and Wei Songhan both had a trace of violence in their eyes. This was a rare opportunity, so they both leaped into the air. They were intending to catch Lin Yun by surprise and deliver the second blow.

“We can’t let him live!” Nie Tian and Han Feng also reached a mutual agreement. Gu Feiyun was alone, but Lin Yun had three alliance-unions behind him. Lin Yun would be harder to deal with if he took the Imperial Sword Herb, so this was the best opportunity since Gu Feiyun was attacking him too.

The two instantly drew their swords and unleashed their attacks right after Xiao Feng and Wei Songhan. With that, the five strongest disciples on the island were going after Lin Yun. This made Lin Qiushan and the party anxious.

“He has become public enemy number one,” sighed Gu Beixuan. The way Lin Yun surpassed everyone earlier had successfully attracted everyone’s attention.

“Big Sister, think of something!” said Lin Yan anxiously.

However, Lin Qiushan didn’t know what to do. She didn’t know the Seven Profound Steps, and even if she did, there was no way her Seven Profound Steps could reach Zhong Yunxiao’s level. But for some reason, she had confidence in Zhong Yunxiao. She had a feeling that this person wouldn’t put himself in danger so easily and that he must have hidden his true strength.

“Interesting…” Unlike everyone else, Lin Yun was calm. He decided to deal with the sword first. But it was a pity that he couldn’t use the Dragon-Tiger Fist. Otherwise, he could show Gu Feiyun the true meaning of dominance.

“You’re not dodging?” Gu Feiyun sneered. He was expecting Lin Yun to try and avoid the attack. But since Lin Yun was courting death, then he couldn’t be blamed.

“Why should I dodge?” Lin Yun raised his hand and flicked his finger. A sword gleam flew out from Lin Yun’s finger and Gu Feiyun’s face turned pale under the strong impact. He felt that he was losing control of his sword and he took several steps.

“He was sent flying with a flick?” The mouths of everyone on the island dropped. This was the nineteenth ranked Gu Feiyun that they were witnessing. How was it possible to send him flying with just a single flick? Was there anything more exaggerated than this? Gu Feiyun’s domineering sword actually seemed like a kitten before Lin Yun’s sword aura. Just how did he manage to do this?

Lin Yun then turned around and his face sank. He was starting to get annoyed with Xiao Feng and Wei Songhan. When Xiao Feng and Wei Songhan saw how Lin Yun sent Gu Feiyun flying with a flick of his finger, their faces turned pale. But it was too late for them to pull their attacks back. In the end, they could only gnash their teeth and go with it.

“Get lost!” Lin Yun roared and stomped his foot. His origin energy and dracophant energy fused together. His stomp caused the ground to tremble. It even froze the sharp gale shrouding the island for an instant.

Before Xiao Feng and Wei Songhan could even get close, they were sent flying while throwing up blood. As for Nie Tian and Han Feng, their faces turned pale from fright. They immediately withdrew their attacks, ignoring the backlash from it. They landed on the ground and only managed to stabilize their bodies after three steps.

First, Lin Yun sent Gu Feiyun flying with a single flick before sending Xiao Feng and Wei Songhan out with a stomp. Lin Yun didn’t have too much concern. He successfully shocked everyone by briefly showing his strength.

“Work together!” roared Gu Feiyun.

“Kill!” Xiao Feng and Wei Songhan wiped the traces of blood off their lips and unleashed their strongest moves without any hesitation. Nie Tian and Han Feng also gnashed their teeth and made the same decision. None of them were willing to give up the Imperial Sword Herb so easily.

Lin Yun was feeling helpless when he saw the five coming at him again. If it wasn’t for the fact that he didn’t want to reveal his identity, he could easily kill them with a single punch from the Dragon-Tiger Fist. But since he couldn’t do that, he had no choice but to let the Iris Flower blossom.

Lin Yun closed his eyes and the Iris Flower in his Dantian blossomed. The power being unleashed felt like an explosive volcano in his body. At this moment, without holding anything back, Lin Yun had unleashed strength in the pinnacle seventh stage.

When he opened his eyes, the Iris Sacred Flame blazed fiercely. The cold gleam in Lin Yun’s eyes made the five tremble. For some reason, they finally felt like retreating.

Lin Yun threw out a punch that was accompanied by boundless sword intent. It erupted like a volcano. A sword gleam shot out, which looked like a dragon in the eyes of the five. Before the five could even react in time, they were sent flying and were covered with blood. They fell onto the ground and struggled to kneel on the ground before looking at Lin Yun with shock.

“You guys are the outer sect’s elites. Don’t try and cross my bottomline anymore. Someone will die if they do it again.” Lin Yun waved his hand and headed towards the Imperial Sword Herb under everyone’s dumbfounded gaze.

Outer sect’s elites? Gu Feiyun and the four were kneeling on the ground feeling bitter in their hearts. It sounded like ridicule to them. If they were considered elites, then what would Zhong Yunxiao be?

Zhong Yunxiao was too unbelievably strong. At this moment, everyone looked at Lin Yun in frozen thought.

When Lin Yun turned around, he looked at the Imperial Sword Herb with a grave expression. Although he only had a thousand meters left, he knew that it wouldn’t be easy. In the six other designated locations, there were others in the same situation as Lin Yun. All of them looked nervous as they relied on either their cultivation, sword intent, or physique to proceed.

“A mere herb dares to call itself imperial? I’ll see what you can do!” The dracophant energy appeared on Lin Yun’s body. The gale within a thousand meters was like a ferocious beast. But when Lin Yun was only five hundred meters away, the sword gale looked so real. It was tough for Lin Yun to continue forward even with the Dracophant Battle Physique. His blood would splatter with every step.

Not only him, but those in the six other designated locations faced the same thing. Regardless of if it was Chu Haoyu, Jiang Feng, or Ye Xiu, they were all under great pressure.

Lin Yun looked at the Imperial Sword Herb with deep thought. He knew that he would have to suffer heavy injuries if he continued forward. But for some reason, his origin energy was recovering quickly.

Lin Yun was shocked to realize the exhausted origin energy was actually recovering quickly without the help of pellets or spiritual jades. He looked at the Imperial Sword Herb and his eyes lit up. Could it be that the Iris Sword Sutra could absorb the sword intent in the sword gale?

That’s right! That must be the case! The sword gale came from the Imperial Sword Herb, so it was also a form of energy. Lin Yun laughed in his heart and circulated the Iris Sword Sutra.

The sword gale suddenly weakened when the boundless sword intent poured into the Iris Flower in his Dantian, replenishing his origin energy. A smile rose on his lips as he tried to suppress his joy. Suddenly, the last five hundred meters became easy. Not only was it easy, but his cultivation also started to increase with every step he took. It seemed that the fourth stage’s bottleneck was breaking.

Lin Yun arrived in front of the Imperial Sword Herb within the blink of an eye since there weren’t any obstructions and he plucked the herb. In the next second, the sword gale in the surroundings disappeared. Meanwhile, Chu Haoyu and the rest in the other designated locations were still holding on bitterly.

The observation platform exploded when they saw one of the seven rays disappearing. This meant that someone managed to take the first Imperial Sword Herb!

“Haha, there’s the outcome! It must be Chu Haoyu! Who else could it be aside from him?” Bai Ting laughed. The other elders also smiled as they looked at Luo Feng while thinking of the 5,000 second-grade spiritual jades.

How could Lin Yun possibly obtain the first Imperial Sword Herb? On the Burial Sword Peak, a person was riding on a Sword Condor. The elder landed on the observation platform and immediately rushed towards the elders.

“Is there an outcome?” The leaders of the various alliance-unions became nervous as they looked at the elder's location. Everyone wanted to know who took the first Imperial Sword Herb.

“It’s naturally Chu Haoyu,” replied Wang Yan as he walked over casually.

“Report! The first person obtaining the Imperial Sword Herb has appeared,” said the Elder who came from the Burial Sword Peak.

“Go ahead,” said Bai Ting as he drank his tea.

“The first who obtained the Imperial Sword Herb is the outer disciple by the name of Zhong Yunxiao.”

The cup in Bai Ting’s hand fell onto the ground. It wasn’t Chu Haoyu? Since when was there someone by the name of Zhong Yunxiao in the outer sect? The first to obtain the Imperial Sword herb wasn’t Chu Haoyu, Ye Xiu, or Jiang Feng, but someone that no one heard of?

Bai Ting, along with all the elders and leaders of the various alliance-unions, was dumbfounded. Who was Zhong Yunxiao?
