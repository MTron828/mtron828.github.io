Chapter 1747 - Turbulance Rising Again

When he executed the Divine Phoenix Touch, an ancient phoenix cry echoed from within his body. As crimson flames blazed on him, the flames' radiance contained an ancient yet aloof aura.

This scene instantly made everyone from the Divine Phoenix Mountain’s faces change with great billows in their hearts. This was because the divine phoenix aura coming from Lin Yun was too pure, making them wonder where Lin Yun got his inheritance from.

Thus, this naturally left the Divine Phoenix Mountain’s disciples shocked. Others might not know what the divine phoenix aura meant, but they knew what it signified because they had interacted with it from the first day they joined the Divine Phoenix Mountain.

But what shocked them even more was that Lin Yun appeared to have grown an extra pair of hands, and his fingers moved at an unbelievable speed. Lin Yun used one pair of hands to play the zither while his other pair of hands played the flute.

Everyone began to rub their eyes and wondered if their eyes were messing with them. When they looked closer, they realized that Lin Yun wasn’t playing the zither and flute with an extra hands, but Lin Yun was divided into two.

He used two hands to play the flute and two to play the zither. But his speed was too quick, alternating between the two musical instruments, and his fingers were moving so quickly that no one could see clearly. Lin Yun’s hands gradually blurred in their eyes, and his divine phoenix aura became even more apparent, making everyone from the Divine Phoenix Mountain exclaim.

“How is this possible?!”

“That’s the Divine Phoenix Touch!”

“Where did he get his inheritance from? The Divine Phoenix Touch is already long lost!”

Lin Yun’s performance dumbfounded those from the Divine Phoenix Mountain.

The faces of Li Yuxi, Zhang Ying, and Chen Jun also changed. As the clouds tumbled across the stage, the tables were turned around in the blink of an eye. Lin Yun used his music to resist the torrential flames and block the attacks from the other two. It didn’t take long before Zhang Ying, and Chen Jun reached their limit.

Lin Yun played two ancient scores simultaneously, the Prairie Phoenix Fire and Sun and Moon. He played Sun and Moon with the flute, manifesting a sun and a moon in the sky revolving around, stopping the sea of flames summoned by Li Yuxi from getting close to him.

On the other hand, he played the Prairie Phoenix Fire with the zither, and the ferocity of this song made Zhang Ying and Chen Ying feel terrible. They failed to restrict Lin Yun, and their music became even more chaotic.

Fifteen minutes later, his zither music swept back before manifesting into a fire phoenix. When the phoenix manifested, Zhang Ying and Chen Jun threw out a mouthful of blood before they were sent flying away. With that, Lin Yun and Li Yuxi were the only ones left on the Nirvana Stage.

This made Li Yuxi’s face change. He was strong, and his attainment in music dao far surpassed Zhang Ying and Chen Jun. But his true strength laid in his Flame Intent, containing both Yin and Yang attributes. The ocean of flames might seem chaotic, but there was a circulation of Yin and Yang. As Yin and Yang circulated, it blocked all incoming attacks.

The stalemate lasted briefly before Lin Yun abandoned the zither and dashed over with the flute. With both hands on the flute, musical notes constantly exploded in mid-air, and he flew over with a horrifying aura. He was standing on a phoenix, which looked like it would sweep through everything.

The fire dragons charging at him were all destroyed, which made Li Yuxi’s face ugly, with a terrifying chill flickering in his pupils. Ultimately, he decided to stake it all and charged towards Lin Yun.

One side was a divine phoenix, while the other was a boundless ocean of flames. They quickly collided under everyone’s gazes. When the phoenix and the ocean of fire crashed, Li Yuxi immediately felt an irresistible power that shattered his ocean of fire.

But that wasn’t the end. When the phoenix Lin Yun stood on flapped its wings, countless fire arrows flew towards Li Yuxi. Under the barrage of attacks, Li Yuxi was quickly knocked down from the sky.

Throwing out a mouthful of blood, Li Yuxi’s face became terrifyingly pale, and everyone was shocked to witness this scene. On the Nirvana Stage, Lin Yun was the only one standing, stepping on the phoenix.

“This…” They could feel that Lin Yun had completely suppressed Li Yuxi with his music dao. Under immense pressure, Li Yuxi was nearly forced down to his knees.Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Still want Weiwei to dance for you?” Lin Yun indifferently said. “I already have something I wanted to tell you long ago. Do you want Weiwei to dance for you? Are you even qualified?”

Everyone was speechless because Lin Yun really sought revenge for even the slightest grievance. Li Yuxi invited Yue Weiwei to dance at the banquet, but he was slapped by Yue Weiwei instead. Back then, Lin Yun’s reaction wasn’t great. But it turned out he remembered it and was waiting for this moment.

Everyone couldn’t help feeling sympathy for Li Yuxi. He had thoroughly embarrassed himself as someone with the highest fame at this banquet. Not only did he fail to become first on the Nirvana Banquet, but he was so ruthlessly humiliated.

Right then, Li Yuxi snapped the bamboo flute in his hand before slamming his palm on the Nirvana Stage, causing the surrounding space to distort. His pupils turned red as he looked at Lin Yun, and he nearly went insane. He roared, “I, Li Yuxi, have never been humiliated like this! Lin Xiao, you can have the first position for the Nirvana Banquet, but if you have the guts, come and fight me with swords. If I can’t defeat you within ten moves, I’ll go down on my knees and kowtow!”
