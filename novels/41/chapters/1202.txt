Chapter 1203 - Brewing Storm!

Many people had died from the Azure Dragon Sword Array over the last eighteen years. So Lin Yun’s words angered Feng Xuanzi to the point that he threw up another mouthful of blood.

Now all Lin Yun had to do was face the Four Phase Sword Array. Many people got past this array in the other Hidden Sword Pavilions, but it had never happened in the Azure Rock Hidden Sword Pavilion.

Four Elysium Core Realm experts from the Hidden Sword Manor would take control of the Four Phase Sword Array. The local managing clan wouldn’t even get a chance to touch it.

Sheathing his sword, Lin Yun took a Nirvana Pellet out. He didn’t get a single chance to rest during the Sword Assembly, so he needed to recover.

After suffering wounds to the Hundred Ghost Sword Array and Azure Dragon Sword Array, there was no way Lin Yun could fight at full strength.

Although his injuries technically didn’t need a Nirvana Pellet, Lin Yun took one anyway. The pellet would heal his hidden wounds as well as help his cultivation. After all, those who faced life and death would usually see drastic improvements.

Lin Yun might not be able to make full use of the pellet, but it was best for him to be prepared for the final round. He had to digest a lot of insights, so this was the best time to do so. Meanwhile, the crowd silently waited for Lin Yun to start the third round.

Bai Ting and Luo Hua were wearing grave expressions. They didn’t expect Lin Yun to get this far. After all, the competition was too intense. Initially, they only planned for Lin Yun to go through the process so they could give the sect master an explanation.

But now that Lin Yun was the champion and made it past two rounds, he was one round away from retrieving the Lightning Shadow Sword. Then again, they both knew that this round would be even more terrifying than the first two rounds. However, Lin Yun had a chance.

“Young Master Luo, will the Azure Rock Hidden Sword Pavilion really allow us to leave with the Lightning Shadow Sword?” Bai Ting asked in an uneasy voice. It was good that Lin Yun passed the second round, but taking the Lightning Shadow Sword away could really make Feng Xuanzi angry. Plus, anything could happen outside the city.

Luo Hua didn’t reply and suddenly turned to look at Feng Xuanzi whispering to the Grand Elder. As the Grand Elder nodded his head, his face became darker before he quietly left the plaza.

At the same time, the elders from the other clans were also discussing among themselves to find out the truth of Lin Yun and Luo Hua’s identity. After all, Lin Yun was after a priceless treasure made by the Mo Clan.

The Mo Clan was even more famous than the Hidden Sword Manor. It was also a mysterious clan that existed since ancient times and no one knew where it was.

If Lin Yun really managed to retrieve the Lightning Shadow Sword, he might get targeted by other clans.

“It’ll probably be tough,” said Luo Hua.

Her reply made Bai Ting’s face change as he whispered, “I’ll be back shortly.”

Luo Hua merely nodded her head when she heard that. She could guess that Bai Ting probably went to look for the Huang Clan to discuss some sort of protection. After all, the Huang Clan’s patriarch was friends with the sect master, and the Huang Clan was also capable of protecting them if they really retrieved the Lightning Shadow Sword.

As Lin Yun rested, the people in attendance began to send messages to their clans. Ye Feiffan was also holding onto a jade plaque, but he ultimately put it down. Everyone around him was sending messages, but he couldn’t bring himself to do it. Even the Feng Clan was busy because their guards were nowhere to be found.

It appeared that the Feng Clan was making preparations just in case the Lightning Shadow Sword was taken away from them. After all, it would cause a huge shock in the Ancient Barren Domain. Then again, who could guarantee that Lin Yun would make it through the Four Phase Sword Array?

“There’s a storm brewing.” Ye Feifan sighed and the cheeky smile disappeared from his face.

At this moment, Feng Xingyang and Feng Xiaoyu were both chatting among themselves with unpleasant facial expressions. The matter now involved the foundation of the Feng Clan.

If the Lightning Shadow Sword was really taken from them, the Feng Clan might not own the pavilion anymore. Losing the sword would strike a heavy blow to their reputation and the Hidden Sword Manor would certainly question them.

When Zhao Yan swept his gaze around, he could see Gong Haoran and Gongsun Yan transmitting news as well. Clearly, the nature of the Sword Assembly was changing.

Suddenly, he sensed the sword intent in his body begin to tremble. Lifting his head, he noticed several strangers outside of the Feng Clan’s manor. They had hidden their aura well and were probably waiting on the first floor of the manor.

“All sorts of people have come because they think the Lightning Shadow Sword might appear. They’re really quick to make a move.” Gongsun Yan’s eyes flickered because he could see many scenes that Zhao Yan couldn’t.

Zhao Yan glanced at him and asked, “Aren’t you tempted as well? Didn’t you just transmit information to your clan?”

“Me?” Gongsun Yan smiled, “I know the meaning of being sinful with treasures. I don’t have the guts to possess the Lightning Shadow Sword. I merely transmitted the information to a senior of mine who is fond of collecting Mo Clan treasures. You know my awkward position well. I’m ultimately not a genuine disciple of the Sword Emperor’s lineage. I would have had a chance if I was the winner of the Sword Assembly though.”

Zhao Yan snorted and didn’t even bother to look at Gongsun Yan. He couldn’t believe what he was hearing.

“Don’t worry. If the seniors of the Sword Emperor’s lineage are really tempted, it’ll be beneficial to Lin Yun. They naturally won’t stoop so low to harm Lin Yun. In fact, they might even give him something comparable to the sword. But if the Gong Clan of the Ancient Barren Domain comes, Lin Yun won’t even have any bones left. Tsk, tsk…” Gongsun Yan smiled.

“What are you implying?” Gong Haoran’s face changed. The Gong Clan was also a Saint Clan. They wouldn’t care if they killed a disciple of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect.

“You know well in your heart,” smiled Gongsun Yan.

Zhao Yan glanced at the two of them and was unhappy that they didn’t place Lin Yun in their eyes. It was almost like the Lightning Shadow Sword was destined to go to someone else.

Feng Xiaoyu became unhappy and roared, “Cut it out. The Lightning Shadow Sword still belongs to my Feng Clan and he won’t succeed.” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The other members of the Feng Clan also glanced at the two of them unhappily when Feng Xiaoyu spoke out.

An hour later, Luo Hua asked casually upon seeing the worried expression on Bai Ting’s face, “It didn’t go well?”

“Yeah. The Huang Clan’s patriarch only promised to protect us for a day in the city. If we leave the city, we’re on our own…” Bai Ting nodded his head helplessly.

“What did the sect master say?” Luo Hua asked.

“The sect master merely acknowledged it.” Bai Ting sighed before he continued to speak with an awkward expression, “He said that Lin Yun still hasn’t gotten the sword and told me not to make a big fuss about it. Plus, Lin Yun could die in the third round anyway…”

“Well, he’s not wrong.” Luo Hua replied, but no one could see her expression under the hood.

When Lin Yun opened his eyes under the tense atmosphere, his eyes shined bright. After recovering all of his strength, the sword cocoon in his forehead had grown bigger. Clearly, the Sword Assembly helped him grow a lot faster than the Profound Azure Prefecture.

“Time for the third round,” said Lin Yun while he looked at Feng Xuanzi. At this moment, the entire plaza burst into an uproar because they were finally going to see the third round.

With a cold face, Feng Xuanzi waved his hand and three elders descended from the sky. They all looked to be at least a few hundred years old based on the wrinkles on their faces. All of them were in the Elysium Core Realm, ranging from lesser to heavenly.

Geniuses in the top thousand could face experts in the lesser Elysium Core Realm, but the greater Elysium Core Realm was an entirely different story. Then there were the heavenly Elysium Core Realm, who were invincible beneath the Dragon Pulse Realm.

“Who’s the last person?” Lin Yun asked.

“Me! I’ll tear you apart today!” A roar sounded out as the Grand Elder of the Feng Clan suddenly appeared from the sky, which left everyone shocked.
