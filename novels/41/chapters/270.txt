Chapter 271 - Speechless

The Contribution Hall’s gate opened with a creak. Compared to the plaza outside, the hall was rather empty and didn’t have many disciples. So, Lin Yun’s appearance instantly drew everyone’s attention.

After all, the news of Lin Yun running into Bloodbone Wandering Cultivators had spread around like wildfire, not to mention that Lin Yun was someone who killed Wang Ning and Ye Liuyun.

Even if someone had never seen Lin Yun before, they definitely heard of how Lin Yun chased after the wind and slew Ye Liuyun. So a commotion instantly broke out when everyone heard that Lin Yun ran into danger outside the sect. But they were stunned when they saw Lin Yun walking in unharmed.

“He actually came back!”

“That’s him, right? The one who accepted the five star missions three months ago.”

“He’s probably back for punishment. How can he possibly complete four five star A-rank missions by himself?” Many people began to whisper among themselves in the Contribution Hall.

Lin Yun wasn’t surprised by their response because he had just experienced this outside. He ignored them and went to the blue-clothed deacon responsible for missions.

“Lin Yun?” The deacon was stunned when he saw Lin Yun and asked, “What are you doing here? Shouldn’t you look for Elder Luo Feng to seek forgiveness for your failure? Why are you here in the contribution hall?”

The deacon naturally didn’t think that Lin Yun completed the four missions, which was why he automatically said these words.

“Seek forgiveness? Why? I’m naturally willing to accept all the punishment if I failed the missions, but I didn’t,” replied Lin Yun.

“I know about your situation. You even attracted Guardian Plum by practicing the Overlord Sword. Young man, it’s fine if you boast in front of fellow disciples, but why bother acting in front of me? Honestly speaking, the Contribution Hall won’t do anything to you as long as you can complete any one of the missions.” The deacon paused briefly before looking at Lin Yun and smiled coldly, “After all, you’re someone that Guardian Plum has his eyes on. However, don’t think that means you can lie in the Contribution Hall.”

The smile disappeared from the deacon’s face and his words caused a commotion in the hall. Everyone started looking at Lin Yun with renewed interest.

“So he has someone backing him up! And here I was wondering what gave him the courage to be so arrogant.”

“It’s unfair!”

“But the Contribution Hall doesn’t seem like they will let him get away with acting. At least we can enjoy the show.”

The deacon clearly thought that Lin Yun was trying to use Guardian Plum as his backer to force the Contribution Hall to go along with the act.

“Do I look like someone who boasts?” Lin Yun started retrieving blood crystals from his interspatial pouch. He produced a total of fifty of them.

The deacon’s expression changed when he saw the blood crystals. He glanced at Lin Yun before examining the crystals and his face changed. “Blood crystals! It’s really the blood crystals! An exquisite blood crystal, this belongs to the Bloodwolf King!”

The deacon’s eyes lit up when he saw a blood crystal that stood out from the others. Then, Lin Yun took it away and replaced it with an ordinary blood crystal and said, “Sorry, this should be the right one.”

“So what if you’ve completed one of the missions? Didn’t you accept four missions?” snorted the deacon.

Lin Yun didn’t bother arguing with the deacon. He took out the Goldflow Fruit along with the certificate that he received from Bai Qiushui. But before the deacon could finish verifying them, Lin Yun tossed a decapitated head on the table. The face was drained of blood and the eyes were still open. The sudden appearance of the head made the deacon jump up from his seat.

“Great Thief Xue Feng’s head! How is this possible? How did you manage to kill him?” The deacon took out a painting to verify it was Xue Feng and he was left shocked. It was indeed Xue Feng’s head.

“I killed him and took his head. Everyone knows how to do that,” replied Lin Yun. His reply made the deacon’s lips twitch and smile bitterly. It was true that everyone knew how to kill someone and take the head. However, someone who could even kill Xue Feng was right here on the premises! There were tens of thousands of disciples in the outer sect, but who dared to go after Xue Feng?

With that, Lin Yun had completed all four missions one month before the due date. His efficiency shocked everyone. Lin Yun looked at the deacon and asked, “Deacon, do you still feel that I’m baselessly acting?”

The other deacons and elders were shocked by this scene. They were deeply shocked when they came over to verify the items on the table.

“It’s really Xue Feng’s head. There’s no faking it.”

“This is the Goldflow Fruit. We can finally give an explanation to Elder Hua from the Pellet Hall after so many months.”

“Killing Xue Feng at such a young age. This boy has truly flaunted our sect’s might!”

“Incredible! He actually completed four five stars missions by himself. Have we ever had an outer disciple who accomplished such feats?” The elders and deacons were filled with praises for Lin Yun.

The blue-clothed deacon’s face blushed in embarrassment and he immediately smiled, “I’ve misjudged you, so I apologize for my previous behavior. Here’s your reward.”

Aside from the contribution points, Lin Yun received a total of 1,300 second-grade spiritual jades. The ample reward made all the disciples present enviously look at Lin Yun.

“Holy shit… So many second-grade spiritual jades… I might be able to make a breakthrough if I had ten of those!”

“No wonder Guardian Plum values him so greatly. So it turns out that Senior Brother Lin is extraordinary.” Everyone stopped what they were doing and looked at Lin Yun enviously.

“I’ll be taking my leave then.” Lin Yun was satisfied after receiving the second-grade spiritual jades. But he was stopped just as he was about to leave.

“There’s a special reward for killing the wandering cultivators on the Great Thief Ranking. Please hand your Sword Firmament Token to me for a moment!” The blue-clothed deacon no longer dared to treat Lin Yun lightly and showed respect this time around.

“There’s a special reward?” asked Lin Yun as he handed his Sword Firmament Token over.

The blue-clothed deacon smiled, “Please wait for me. I’m going to hand your Sword Firmament Token to the hall master. This reward has to be given by the hall master himself.”

Those outside the Contribution Hall had no idea what was going on. They were still looking at Zhang Lei with complicated eyes. Some of them even rejoiced at Zhang Lei’s misfortune. Zhang Lei had a habit of asking people to kneel and he even bullied many people just because he was in the top ten on the Mortal Ranking.

Then, two silhouettes landed on the ground and looked at Zhang Lei with surprised expressions.

When the spectators saw those two, their faces changed and they exclaimed, “Eighth ranked Lu Hexuan and ninth ranked Xin Wuhen of the Mortal Ranking!”

But before they finished yelling, several more figures appeared. It was the seventh ranked Huo Donglai, sixth ranked Wei Zilin, fifth ranked Yan Shigao, and fourth ranked Han Zhengyang of the Mortal Ranking.

They were rarely seen on normal days, so everyone was shocked to see seven of them appearing. No one would believe that this was a coincidence. They just had to think briefly to know that it was because of Lin Yun.

Although the six of them didn’t have a conflict with Lin Yun like Zhang Lei did, Lin Yun had taken the missions that belonged to them. So it was equivalent to getting slapped on the face. None of those in the top ten could tolerate any sand in their eyes and pretend that nothing had happened.

Among the six of them, Han Zhengyang was the strongest. He questioned with a cold face, “Zhang Lei, what are you doing on your knees in public?”

“You’re an embarrassment. How can someone like you be in the top ten of the Mortal Ranking?!” yelled Huo Donglai. He was known for being irritable.

Right at this moment, Xin Wuhen, who had a rather good relationship with Zhang Lei, spoke out, “Everyone, please calm down. Junior Brother Zhang, get on your feet and tell us what’s going on. Who did you offend for you to kneel here?”

Zhang Lei was feeling bitter in his heart. He had never felt so humiliated. But he didn’t dare to get on his feet. Now that he thought about it, his fight with Lin Yun could be resolved with one move. Lin Yun only used the Dragon Painting to destroy his sword intent and the density of Lin Yun’s origin energy was higher than him from how he cracked the ground with his foot.

Furthermore, he estimated that Lin Yun had only used 30% of his strength in their fight. He began to sweat when he thought about it. What did that mean? It meant that Lin Yun could easily cripple him anytime and anywhere! It was just a matter of whether or not Lin Yun wanted to.

“Junior Brother Lin forced me to kneel and I have to stay kneeling for eighteen hours.” Zhang Lei lowered his head and didn’t dare to look Xin Wuhen in the eyes.

“Junior Brother Lin? Who is he for him to act so arrogant?” snorted Han Zhengyang.

“He’s Lin Yun,” answered Zhang Lei honestly. His words instantly caused the six of their faces to change. They were here because they heard that Lin Yun had shown up, but they never expected that Zhang Lei, who was one step ahead of them, would end up in such a terrible state.

“Good! He’s clearly trying to humiliate all ten of us!” The six of them became furious. Although the ten of them belonged to different alliance-unions, they could still be considered one entity since they held the same position. But Lin Yun had given them a slap before they even saw him.

“Stand up!” barked Han Zhengyang.

However, Zhang Lei remained kneeling on the ground. He would’ve already gotten up on his feet if he could. After all, who wanted to suffer such humiliation in public? But he dispelled his thoughts whenever he thought of Lin Yun’s cold gaze.

He had a feeling that he would be in a more terrible state if he dared to move. Lin Yun might seem amiable, but that was under the premise that no one provoked him.

“Senior Brother Han, just ignore me. I’ll be fine after kneeling for a bit.” Zhang Lei lowered his head with his teeth gnashed.

“You’re courting death!” Han Zhengyang started releasing his aura, but Zhang Lei didn’t dare to move and remained kneeling. This made all six of their faces become ugly. They rushed over only to have their faces slapped by Lin Yun. This made all of them feel a stinging pain on their faces. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Will you get up on your feet if the two of us ask you to get up?” Two figures descended and caused a commotion in the surrounding. The newcomers were Jiang Feng and Ye Xiu, the second and third on the Mortal Ranking.
