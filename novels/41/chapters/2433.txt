Chapter 2434 - Azure Dragon

The Divine Phoenix Holy Master forced all the Great Saints to retreat with one sword. As for the Great Saints, who failed to retreat in time, they groaned with cracks appearing on their domains. Only the Flame Crow Great Saint and Heavenly Glory Great Saint managed to take the attack head-on amongst the twenty-odd Great Saints. Even so, the Flame Crow Great Saint and Heavenly Glory Great Saint were still forced to retreat to Tian Xuanzi’s Golden-Purple Dragon Throne.

“Spread out,” Tian Xuanzi said indifferently before he flicked his finger and the Golden Dragon Sword flew out. The Golden Dragon Sword bore a boundless sword aura that shattered the Divine Phoenix Holy Master’s sword ray.

The faces of the Flame Crow Great Saint and Heavenly Glory Great Saint were ugly. Regardless of Tian Xuanzi or the Divine Phoenix Holy Master, they weren’t Sword Saints proficient in sword dao, but they merely used the sword. Even so, their strength was higher than the other Great Saints.

The Golden Dragon Sword turned into a golden dragon as it returned, sheathing into the throne behind him with a sword vibration.

“As expected of the Divine Phoenix Holy Master who could rival the Radiant Sword Saint. I have experienced this sword,” Tian Xuanzi said, looking at the Divine Phoenix Holy Master. The other Great Saints took this opportunity to retreat to the Golden-Purple Dragon Throne to avoid a frontal clash with the Divine Phoenix Holy Master.

“Profound Sky Great Saint is truly impressive.” The Divine Phoenix Holy Master exclaimed, looking at Tian Xuanzi seated on the Golden-Purple Dragon Throne. He didn’t dare to look down on the latter.

“Holy Master, there’s no need to waste saliva with him, he’s trying to buy time. Mu Xuankong suffered injuries, and the Sword Sect must be in chaos under the dragon’s claw. This is a great opportunity for us!” The Heavenly Sever Great Saint warned, looking at Mu Xuankong on Scarlet Firmament Peak.

Tian Xuanzi waved his hand, “It doesn’t matter. The barrier has broken, and the saint vein will be destroyed sooner or later. Even if he’s trying to buy time, the Divine Phoenix Holy Master does have that qualification to make me wait for him.”

“Impressive courage,” the Divine Phoenix Holy Master smiled.

Tian Xuanzi curiously asked, “How did Lin Yun manage to persuade you? Do you mind sharing it with me? If you didn’t come, the Sword Sect could be easily destroyed.”

The Divine Phoenix Holy Master said, “He fulfilled the long-cherished wish of the Divine Phoenix Mountain. But even without that, I will come just on the fact that he gave the divine flame fragment to us.” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Tian Xuanzi fell into deep thoughts upon hearing that before waving his hand. The Imperial Dragon Order then flew towards the Light Subduing Great Saint, startling the latter.

“Light Subduing Great Saint, I’ll lend the Imperial Dragon Order to you. All the Saints present will listen to your orders, and those who go against it are the same as being disrespectful to the Empress,” Tian Xuanzi said. “I’ll have a spar with the Divine Phoenix Holy Master while you command the attack on the Sword Sect.”

“Roger that!” The Light Subduing Great Saint rejoiced, saying, “Heavenly Sever, Heavenly Glory, Flame Crow Great Saints, you three attack Scarlet Firmament Peak with me while the other Great Saints go after the remaining main peaks. As for the other Saints, spread out and wipe out the hundred and eight peaks.”

“Roger that!” Everyone received the order and passed by the Divine Phoenix Holy Master, charging at the Sword Sect.

This made the Divine Phoenix Holy Master’s face change because there was no way the Sword Sect could withstand an attack under this arrangement. Scarlet Firmament Peak only had Mu Xuankong and the Azure Python Great Saint, and the six main peaks only had two Great Saints each. Each main peak would have to face three to four Great Saints.

As for the hundred and eight peaks, they didn’t have enough Saint Sovereigns and Saint Lords to fend off the attack. But the Divine Phoenix Holy Master did nothing despite feeling anxious because Tian Xuanzi was watching him.

Tian Xuanzi smiled, “As you wish, I have been successfully held down by you.”

The Divine Phoenix Holy Master frowned. He could sense that something wasn’t right.

Tian Xuanzi continued with a smile, “If you stayed in Scarlet Firmament Peak, the saint vein in the Sword Sect should be enough to last till the Radiant Sword Saint finishes his tribulation, even if the other main peaks are destroyed. But you guys don’t have a chance now. You want to hold me down, but I also want to kill you. Let us go up and fight. Let me experience your Time Dao!”

Tian Xuanzi placed the Nine-Tailed Fox on the Golden-Purple Dragon Throne and soared to the thirty-six layers of heaven. The Divine Phoenix Holy Master glanced at the Nine-Tailed Fox and had the urge to return to Scarlet Firmament Peak. But he couldn’t verify if Tian Xuanzi was speaking the truth.

The Nine-Tailed Fox was fearless even if the Divine Phoenix Holy Master looked at it. It laid on the throne and looked back at the Divine Phoenix Holy Master with its crimson eyes.

The Divine Phoenix Holy Master disappeared before standing in confrontation against Tian Xuanzi. Like that, the two strongest Great Saints beneath the Kunlun Realm began to fight. As they fought, a battle took place in the Sword Sect with Great Saints descending on the various main peaks.

The hundred and eight peaks also faced the attack of Saint Sovereigns and Saint Lords, and the Sword Sect fell into chaos. The situation wasn’t optimistic for the Sword Sect as the Subduing Light, Heavenly Sever, Heavenly Glory, and Flame Crow Great Saints landed on Scarlet Firmament Peak. They were the four strongest Great Saints aside from Tian Xuanzi.

Scarlet Firmament Peak only had Mu Xuankong and the Azure Python Great Saint. With the Great Profound Sword Array destroyed, Mu Xuankong could only use the surrounding energy to try and put up a fight.

“Only the two of you in Scarlet Firmament Peak?” The Light Subduing Great Saint was surprised. He smiled, “Or does Sect Master Mu think you can protect the Sword Sect with the two of you? Aren’t you looking down on us too much?”

As they spoke, one of the hundred-and-eight peaks collapsed with the saint vein beneath it destroyed. Saint aura began gushing out from the ground, spreading out in the surroundings. The disciples protecting the peak went according to plan and flew towards the Heaven Prolong Peak. They were courageous, but a few of them were killed.

Everyone on Scarlet Firmament Peak could easily see that with a scan of their mental energy, and Mu Xuankong’s face was terrifying. Mu Xuankong had fused with the Greater Heaven Authority Order, and he could sense the decrease of the energies in the surrounding area.

“It looks like we do not need to make a move. The Sword Sect will slowly collapse by itself,” the Light Subduing Great Saint smiled.

The Heavenly Sever Great Saint watched the fight between Tian Xuanzi and the Divine Phoenix Holy Master. The fight between them was so intense that they could even sense the terrifying shockwaves from so far away.

“Let’s end the battle quickly. The two holy masters are fighting, and we don’t know what might happen. We’ll destroy the saint veins first. Even if the Divine Phoenix Holy Master wins, there’s no way the Sword Sect can turn the table around,” the Heavenly Sever Great Saint said.

“I’ll deal with that old man while the three of you deal with Mu Xuankong. It shouldn’t be a problem, right?” The Heavenly Sever Great Saint said before charging at the Azure Python Great Saint.

“Old man?” The Azure Python Great Saint sneered. It had been a long time since he made a move, so apparently everyone had forgotten about the Azure Dragon’s lineage.

The Heavenly Sever Great Saint was arrogant, grasping the Death Dao and Massacre Dao of the thirty-six Sovereign Daos. The two Sovereign Daos could fuse perfectly through the Annihilation Demon Canon. When he unleashed his domain, it looked like eighteen layers of hell appeared.

The three Great Saints looked at this and knew that the Heavenly Sever Great Saint was strong since he could become the chief of the Black Mountain.

Taking the attack head-on, the Azure Python Great Saint took a few steps back, making the Heavenly Sever Great Saint arrogant. He laughed, “Your bones are pretty tough, but I wonder how many attacks you can take from me? My annihilation saint energy tempered through the Sovereign Demonic Purgatory doesn't feel good, right? Hahaha!”

On the other side, the three Great Saints joined hands and attacked Mu Xuankong. As long as they could get rid of Mu Xuankong and the Azure Python Great Saint, they could sever the saint vein beneath Scarlet Firmament Peak, ending the battle.

But Mu Xuankong was empowered by the earth energy from the surroundings. Seven swords appeared behind him, catching the Light Subduing Great Saint by surprise and sending the latter flying away. When he swung his sword, Mu Xuankong pushed his Great Profound Sword Canon to the limit, forcing the Heavenly Glory and Flame Crow Great Saints to retreat.

“What’s going on?” The Heavenly Sever Great Saint was briefly stunned as the Azure Python Great Saint’s eyes shone brightly.

“Azure Dragon’s Rage!” A constellation opened behind the Azure Python Great Saint as the surrounding heaven and earth began to tremble. With an explosion, the Heavenly Sever Great Saint was sent flying away with blood dripping down from his lips.

When the Azure Python Great Saint’s clothes exploded, he revealed his muscular upper body, looking like an Azure Dragon that had come to life. He laughed as fighting spirits blazed within his eyes, “Old man? Even the Southern Emperor suffered in my hands before he rose, so who do you think you are? Do you dare address me as ‘old man’? I am the Azure Python Great Saint! After the Dragon’s Gate was destroyed, I’m the two hundredth patriarch of the Azure Dragon’s lineage!”

“Leave this place first! This fellow is too strong under the empowerment of the Great Profound Sword Array,” the Light Subduing Great Saint said. He continued, “ Let’s sever his connection with the other main peaks first.”

“You guys think you can leave?!” Mu Xuankong snorted. The entire Scarlet Firmament Peak began to tremble as boundless sword intent radiated, with the entire mountain looking like a sword descending from the sky.

The Azure Python Great Saint roared as he manifested into an Azure Dragon, coiling around Scarlet Firmament Peak. When he charged forth, the four Great Saints could only dodge quickly.

When Mu Xuankong soared to the sky, he stood on the dragon’s head and coldly said, “Gentlemen, stay on Scarlet Firmament Peak and die!”

These four were enemies and the strongest batch of Great Saints aside from Tian Xuanzi. If they went to the other peaks, no one could stop them, and this scene also shocked the four of them.

The Light Subduing Great Saint calmly said, “He’s only a Saint Sovereign, not to mention that the Great Profound Sword Canon has two peaks missing. He won’t be able to last for long!”

The four knew it was dangerous for them now, and Scarlet Firmament Peak was a trap for them. They had to bring out their full strength if they wanted to survive.
