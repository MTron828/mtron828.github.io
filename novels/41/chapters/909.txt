Chapter 910 - Flame Barrier

Seeing Lin Yun’s fighting spirit, Chen Xuan’s heart sank. Clearly, Lin Yun was underestimating his enemies. Even if Lin Yun faced them one on one, Chen Xuan didn’t think that Lin Yun had any hopes of defeating Leng Yue or Pei Yu.

After all, they were both in the first soul Heavenly Soul Realm. Even if Lin Yun had reached the Heavenly Soul Realm, there was still a huge gap in their cultivation.

“So arrogant despite facing death. You’re really ignorant!”

“I want to see what strength you have to be so arrogant!” Pei Yu and Leng Yue sneered with mockery on their faces. In their eyes, Lin Yun was too arrogant to say those words. Circulating their aura oceans to the limit, a terrifying aura came crashing down on Lin Yun.

Lin Yun’s eyes flashed sharply as the Flower Burial Sword started trembling violently; it longed for battle. Sensing Flower Burial’s fighting spirits, Lin Yun was surprised. In his mind, Pei Yu and Leng Yue weren’t qualified to receive his sword. After all, he didn’t even draw his sword when facing Chen Qiong and Xian Yunzhen. Why would he need to use his sword against these clowns?

Then again, a dao artifact ultimately needed to taste blood. It was just a simple matter of swinging one sword. Lin Yun quickly made his decision.

“Haha! Was that brat scared silly? You haven’t even seen how terrifying a first soul Heavenly Soul Realm expert can be. It’s too late for you to escape!” Seeing that Lin Yun wasn’t moving after they released their aura, Pei Yu and Leng Yue both started to laugh. After all, Lin Yun was just an ant in their eyes.

“Watch out!” yelled Chen Xuan.

Despite Chen Xuan’s warning, Lin Yun took a step forward and summoned Flower Burial from the sword box. The moment he held it, he instantly executed Lightning Cocoon.

Pouring his origin energy into his sword, a boundless sword ray exploded and dyed the entire sky azure-purple. With his brilliant sword ray crashing down, Pei Yu and Leng Yue’s aura was torn apart like paper.

Pei Yu and Leng Yue squinted their eyes with fear flashing as they quickly retreated. The sword ray was too dazzling and everything had settled down by the time Chen Xuan opened his eyes. Pei Yu and Leng Yue panicked as they quickly checked their bodies for injuries.

After all, Lin Yun’s sword was too terrifying and had completely intimidated them. After they were done checking their bodies for injuries, Leng Yue sneered because he didn’t find anything. “Cut the act. All that effort just for a little bit of light!”

“You’re really courageous. How dare you try to scare us when you’re on the brink of death. There’s no meaning to this…” Pei Yu folded his arms together and stared at Lin Yun coldly. This time, however, there was a trace of fear in his eyes. But when he saw Lin Yun sheathing his sword, he started to mock Lin Yun. “The battle hasn’t ended yet. Isn’t it a little too early for you to sheath your sword? Do you really think that we’ll let you go?”

“I’m sorry, but the two of you are already dead. After all, I only need one sword to kill you,” said Lin Yun. The moment he was done speaking, a purple lightning cocoon started to take form in their mind.

“What the hell are you talking about? You must be insan—” Suddenly both of their faces changed and they could no longer finish their sentence.

When Lin Yun finished sheathing his sword, Pei Yu and Leng Yue’s heads blew up as their corpses fell to the ground. They would never know how they died.

“T-t-this…” Meanwhile, Chen Xuan was completely dumbfounded. What just happened? This scene had completely gone against common sense. He couldn’t describe the shock he was feeling right now because everything happened too quickly. Just how did Lin Yun do this?

There were many cultivators heading towards the Glorysun Spirit who were attracted by the sword ray. So they had witnessed an unbelievable scene too. The shock that they felt was even greater than Chen Xuan’s shock.

“Who the hell is that guy? Isn’t he a little too strong to kill both of those first soul Heavenly Soul Realms when he’s only a Heavenly Soul Realm?”

“Wait, is that the same Lin Yun who blackmailed two geniuses from the higher realms?”

“Azure clothes, sword, and a sword box. That must be him! That’s the Profound Amber Realm’s Lin Yun!”

“Isn’t he a little too terrifying to be from the lower realms? I didn’t believe the rumors, but that sword proved me wrong.” The shock of witnessing Lin Yun kill Pei Yu and Leng Yue with a sword had astounded everyone. In fact, they forgot to continue their journey towards the phenomena.

At this moment, several figures flew over as they gathered around Chen Xuan and Lin Yun. It was Qin Feng and Yan Kui. They were also rushing towards the Glorysun Spirit when they saw Lin Yun and Chen Xuan.

“You’re injured?” Qin Feng frowned after checking on Chen Xuan’s injuries. They came late so they didn’t witness the scene of Lin Yun killing Pei Yu and Leng Yue. More accurately, they were attracted by the sword ray unleashed by Lin Yun, but they didn’t see what happened.

Chen Xuan smiled bitterly because he didn’t know where to start. He knew that Qin Feng and Yan Kui wouldn’t believe it even if he told them what just happened.

But when Chen Xuan saw that Lin Yun had no intentions to hide, he explained everything that happened. When Qin Feng and Yan Kui heard what happened, they quickly turned to look at Lin Yun with shock.

“Is what he said real?” Yan Kui and Qin Feng still couldn’t believe it. They knew that Lin Yun was strong, but not this strong. If they knew, they wouldn’t have dared to travel with Lin Yun.

Lin Yun responded by nodding his head. He had no intentions of hiding. After all, he didn’t even place the geniuses from higher realms in his eyes, not to mention small fries like Pei Yu and Leng Yue. He had undergone a total transformation when he reached the Heavenly Soul Realm, like a dragon returning to the ocean.

After receiving Lin Yun’s confirmation, Qin Feng and Yan Kui started examining Lin Yun with deep shock. As of right now, the aura coming from Lin Yun was bright like a sun.

“Greater Heavenly Soul Realm?!” Yan Kui suddenly exclaimed with surprise. Only now did everyone realize that Lin Yun spent a few days to reach the greater Heavenly Soul Realm. Wasn’t his speed a little too fast? Just what did he obtain in the Flamefeather City?

“We shouldn’t delay any longer. We need to head for the Glorysun Spirit,” said Chen Xuan after taking a deep breath. He couldn’t be bothered with his injuries right now.

They weren’t far from the Glorysun Spirit, so it only took an hour to travel. In the distance, they saw a massive gold barrier enveloped in flames. The entire barrier had various phenomena appearing on its surface.

They weren’t real, but it still left everyone shocked. Several bold geniuses wanted to break through the barrier, but they couldn’t bear the high temperature the moment they got close.

Suddenly, a flock of flaming birds flew down and struck people that were too close. Instantly, they were incinerated, preventing everyone else from approaching.

“Senior brother.” Right at this moment, Liu Yun walked over.

When Chen Xuan saw Liu Yun walking over, he had joy in his pupils. He knew that one of them would definitely have a great harvest in the Flamefeather City if they could survive. Liu Yun was a rising star of their Highcloud Realm who grasped the spiritual sword intent before going through the tribulation. He practically represented the hopes of the Highcloud Realm. In Chen Xuan’s heart, Liu Yun might even be able to grow into another Lin Yun. After all, he had just experienced the terror of a swordsman.

“Senior brother, I had a decent harvest this time,” chuckled Lin Yun while he peeked at Lin Yun. He was confident that Lin Yun couldn’t imagine that he had obtained a 3,000 year old Blood Sun Fruit.

“Let’s talk about it later,” said Chen Xuan. There were many people in the surroundings, so it was best if Liu Yun didn’t reveal his harvest.

Suppressing the excitement in his heart, Liu Yun nodded. He wasn’t in a rush because the fruit would help him go through the tribulation. At that time, everyone would know about it.Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Sensing Liu Yun’s gaze, Lin Yun turned his head over and locked eyes with Liu Yun. When Liu Yun saw Lin Yun looking at him, he gave a smile that completely baffled Lin Yun. Lin Yun had no idea why Liu Yun looked so prideful all of a sudden.

Lin Yun turned his attention back to the barrier because he couldn’t be bothered with such a small matter. Simultaneously, the geniuses from the higher realms were also trying to find a solution to deal with the barrier. With the barrier around, geniuses from the higher realms wouldn’t dare to act so carelessly.

Lin Yun looked at the barrier and fell into deep thoughts. The barrier shouldn’t be fatal to geniuses from higher realms. The reason why they didn’t approach must be because they were waiting for someone.

As time gradually passed, more geniuses arrived at the barrier.

“Mo Han is here!” A figure wielding a halberd appeared just when the atmosphere was getting tense. Since Mo Han was here, Feng Wuji, Shi Feng, and Chen An shouldn’t be far away. These four geniuses were the main competitors for the Glorysun Spirit since they all owned a dao artifact.

Naturally, Mo Han’s arrival instantly drew everyone’s attention.
