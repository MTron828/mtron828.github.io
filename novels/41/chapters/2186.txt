Chapter 2187 - Firmament Sword

When the Thousand Plume Great Saint and Tian Xuanzi faced off, they fell into a stalemate as the aura released by them grew even stronger. This was Tian Xuanzi’s last battle within the Eastern Desolation, and he had already won the five previous battles. There were even scenarios where Tian Xuanzi had to face multiple enemies.

The other holy lands each had Emperors in their sects, but they only had one Emperor. Only the Heavenly Dao Sect was the strongest to have two Emperors, but the two Emperors were the wielders of the two swords, and it had been three thousand years since they last made a move.

The Heavenly Dao Sect might seem to be the strongest, but they also seemed to be the weakest when their Emperors wouldn’t make a move.

Tian Xuanzi was challenged to make a breakthrough. Since he claimed that he was weighing the Eastern Desolation, he was also weighing himself, trying to see where his limit was. Furthermore, he was seeking a title, the title as the strongest beneath the Emperor Realm to become famous throughout the Eastern Desolation.

No one could live for eternity, and even Emperors would become old, or some of them have already become old. But Tian Xuanzi was different because he was barely five hundred years old, and he was like a rising sun who would reach his peak after reaching the Emperor Realm.

Facing such a ruthless person, even Emperors would feel a great pressure. Thinking about the existence behind Tian Xuanzi, the six holy lands of the Eastern Desolation felt a great pressure from Tian Xuanzi.

Today was the final battle. Although many holy lands seemed to have formed a close relationship with Tian Xuanzi, they had their own agendas, hoping that the Thousand Plume Great Saint could suppress Tian Xuanzi. If Tian Xuanzi lost this fight, his invincibility would be broken, and the day he becomes an Emperor would be delayed for a hundred years. This was the mystery of fortune. The stronger you were, the stronger your luck would be, and everything would go down the drain if one loses.

As gazes fell onto the Thousand Plume Great Saint, everyone knew that this person was also a ruthless person. During Ye Guhan’s era, Tian Xuanzi was the protagonist of the Eastern Desolation. But five hundred years ago, the Thousand Plume Great Saint was the protagonist in the Eastern Desolation. After all, who wasn’t a genius, and who hadn’t been young once?

This was the last battle of Tian Xuanzi, and it was a confrontation between two kings. If the Thousand Plume Great Saint was defeated, his era would decline and come to an end. But in reality, it was different from others because the Thousand Plume Great Saint had been looking forward to this battle.

His cultivation hadn’t made any progress in the past few hundred years, so he also wanted to gain insight in his fight with Tian Xuanzi before making a breakthrough, reaching the height that many people dreamt of.

In the next second, the Thousand Plume Great Saint and Tian Xuanzi disappeared as the auras they gave off increased. They didn’t hold back as they released their saint auras. As their auras began to climb, a bizarre scene occurred. According to the height they climbed, the thirty-six layers of heaven should’ve shattered, but the heavenly screen was still above them. At this moment, everyone discovered that the heavenly screen was supported by them as they rose and released their auras. The Thousand Plume Great Saint and Tian Xuanzi had raised the sky high.

When everyone on the ground raised their heads, they discovered that they had become tiny. This scene had caused a huge impact on many people, and it felt as though they were witnessing a legend.

“The sky is lifted!”

“It’s already so terrifying before they clash? Even the thirty-six layers of heaven are supported by them. Holy shit, isn’t this a little too unfathomable?”

“I’m afraid myths and legends are nothing less than this.” Everyone in the surrounding area was dumbfounded.FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

That was the same for Lin Yun, who felt his scalp going numb and was greatly shocked.

“We must win!” Lin Yun was nervous. He hadn’t been so nervous before. After all, this battle was greatly related to his master. If Tian Xuanzi was defeated, Tian Xuanzi wouldn’t be able to stop his master from undergoing his tribulation, not to mention that Tian Xianzi might even lose his life if he was defeated.

“You have to win. You’re the strongest genius of the Eastern Desolation in the past thousand years,” the Gale Rein Great Saint was also praying. His face was dark as he looked at the two fighting, hoping that Tian Xuanzi could swiftly defeat the Thousand Plume Great Saint.

This was because if Ye Qingyu won, even without the Emperor Sword or a sect master, he could unite the entire Heavenly Dao Sect by himself. At that time, the Gale Rein Great Saint’s scheme over the past few hundred years would go down the drain.

Everyone nervously watched this while having different anticipations. They couldn’t see the Thousand Plume Great Saint and Tian Xuanzi, but they could see the rough images of their constellations. Their constellations were shining so brightly that they passed through the thirty-six layers of heaven and were reflected in the starry skies. At this moment, it felt as though the thirty-six layers of heaven didn’t exist, and everyone could see the starry sky when they raised their heads.

“Moon Wheel! Sun Wheel! Golden Wheel! Wood Wheel!”

Lin Yun could faintly see seven wheels like stars around Tian Xuanzi. This was a phenomenon after reaching a high level with the Profound Sky Canon. The Profound Sky Canon had a total of nineteen stages, and half of them were initially missing. But Tian Xuanzi managed to perfect it.

The first nine stages were the entry, and the tenth stage was the real Dragon Spirit Martial Technique, which could manifest the Moon Wheel. The eleventhth stage could manifest the Sun Wheel, which corresponded with the seven glory spirits. After that were the Great Profound Heaven and Tribulation Heaven.

There were legends that if one could master all nineteen stages, one could manifest the Profound Sky Universe in the body, and the Profound Sky Canon would be comparable to a Divine Cultivation Technique.

After the Profound Sky Universe was formed, the body would become comparable to a primordial being of creation, and the body would become a universe.

Lin Yun was observing to see if Tian Xuanzi had reached that level. In terms of sword techniques and cultivation, the Thousand Plume Great Saint held the upper hand and suppressed Tian Xuanzi. But he couldn’t rip apart Tian Xuanzi’s constellation, no matter how he tried.

There were seven wheels hovering around Tian Xuanzi, they were connected with his body, outlining an inner universe. That was the eighteenth stage of the Profound Sky Canon, the Great Profound Heaven. Tian Xuanzi had used it previously in the fight with his master, and Lin Yun had a bad premonition in his heart. He was worried that Tian Xuanzi had reached the nineteenth level of the Profound Sky Canon.

After all, Tian Xuanzi was too calm, despite being suppressed by the Thousand Plume Great Saint. The sky was already riddled with holes under their clash, but the seven wheels were around Tian Xuanzi no matter what, like seven Sovereign Saint Artifacts.

The Thousand Plume Great Saint had already reached a high level with the Dao Yang Saint Canon, like a blazing sun. But the sword rays he unleashed were sent flying by Tia Xuanzi. Despite the fact that there was blood splashing down from the sky from Tian Xuanzi, Lin Yun was still nervously praying that his speculation wouldn’t be real.

“That Tian Xuanzi seems to be a little lacking!” The Tough Peak Saint Sovereign frowned. He could take a better look than Lin Yun. Right from the beginning, Tian Xuanzi was receiving a one-sided beating, and he even suffered several wounds to his body.

“What do you know?” The Gale Rein Great Saint sneered, “Tian Xuanzi is having an easier time than that old fart. The injuries he suffered aren’t serious, and that old fart, Qianyu, is reaching his limit. He will be defeated sooner or later. You just have to watch.”

Despite saying that, the Gale Rein Great Saint was feeling nervous. Far away, Zhao Tianyu and Gu Xinyu were both observing this battle as well. They were shocked because the Thousand Plume Great Saint was stronger than they had expected.

“As expected of the protagonist from the previous era. He has a powerful foundation,” Zhao Tianyu muttered.

“Tian Xuanzi won’t lose, right?” Gu Xinyu asked nervously.

“He won’t lose,” Zhao Tianyu calmly replied with a smile. He knew how strong Tian Xuanzi was. The latter was someone who perfected the incomplete Profound Sky Canon, and he was destined to be stronger than the Thousand Plume Great Saint. Many people were waiting for him to reach the Emperor Realm.

“Judging from the current situation, even if Tian Xuanzi won, the Thousand Plume Great Saint might be able to come out unscathed from the match, and he might even make a breakthrough,” Gu Xinyu frowned.

“Just wait and see.” Zhao Tianyu smiled calmly. This battle lasted for a long time. But no one aside from Saints could see what was going on, and they couldn’t see anything aside from the terrifying phenomena. There were even some people who began to bleed from their eyes. This was because their eyes were injured by the dazzling radiance.

“Not good!” The Dragon Origin Great Saint, Heavenly Jade Sword Saint, and Serene Dust Great Saint’s faces changed. Even Ye Guhan stopped chewing on his fruit with his face becoming grave.

“Master, what’s going on?” Lin Yun asked nervously.

“That space is sealed, and there are many shackles intertwining, forming into spatial fragments,” the Dragon Origin Great Saint said. “Qianyu is trapped in the spatial fragments. Can it be that Tian Xuanzi has grasped the Space Dao?”

Lin Yun was stumped upon hearing that. Wasn’t the Space Dao an Eternal Dao?

“Don’t be afraid. Nirvana is stronger than Time and Space Daos,” Lil’ Purple said from the Iris Secret Realm.

Before Lin Yun could come to his senses, a comet fell from the sky and smashed into the plaza. The altar cracked apart, forming into a shockwave that swept out.

The Heavenly Jade Sword Saint, Serene Dust Great Saint, and Gale Rein Great Saint made a move at the same time and resolved the shockwave, leaving behind a huge hole on the altar. When everyone looked at it, there was a figure lying on the ground with his blood flowing out.

“Master!” The Dao Yang Holy Son collapsed because the comet was the Thousand Plume Great Saint.

As a radiance descended, Tian Xuanzi hovered in the air with seven wheels around him. He basked in the saint radiance, donned in white clothes with golden curly hair. Paired with his flawless facial features, he looked too perfect. Tian Xuanzi looked like a painting hovering above everyone, looking ethereal. He held onto a sword, and he wore a faint smile on his face.

Countless people ran towards the center to support the Thousand Plume Great Saint to his feet. The Serene Dust Great Saint was enveloped in a Buddhist radiance as she poured her saint aura into the Thousand Plume Great Saint’s body. But it was futile because the Thousand Plume Great Saint’s body was fine, and the injury was his forehead.

There was a small cut on his forehead that could be neglected with blood flowing out.

Seeing the wound, Lin Yun couldn’t help feeling a headache because it was the same wound that Big Brother Xin Jue once suffered.

The Thousand Plume Great Saint looked at the sword in Tian Xuanzi’s hand, and muttered, “The Firmament Sword…”
