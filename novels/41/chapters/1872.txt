Chapter 1873 - Ye Qingtian

Lil’ Purple was roughly still fuming. Lin Yun took a deep breath, and his gaze fell onto Lil’ Red. It had been a year since they met, and he could sense the nirvana aura within its body. This meant that Lil’ Red had reached the Nirvana Stage.

On the contrary, Lin Yun was only in the first channel of the Profound Death Stage. One must know that Lil’ Red possessed the Ancient Dracoape Bloodline, cultivating the Ancient Dracoape Art that could excavate the potential within its bloodline. In addition to the fact that Lil’ Red’s power came from its pure strength, it might be able to confront Quasi-Saints. Thus, this was a huge surprise to Lin Yun.

“Lil’ Red, let me take a look at your full strength.” Even if Lil’ Red had become black, Lin Yun was used to calling it Lil’ Red.

Lil’ Red became an Ancient Dracoape that resembled a mountain before Lin Yun. As the Ancient Dracoape roared, it released a terrifying baleful aura that was mixed with a ferocity that made Lin Yun’s clothes wildly flutter in the wind. Because of the pressure coming from Lil’ Red, Lin Yun was forced to take three steps back.

When he raised his head to look at Lil’ Red, he could feel an immense pressure coming at him, which naturally shocked him. “Seventh transformation of the Nirvana Stage!”

Even if Lin Yun used his Heavenly Dome Sword Intent, he might not be able to obtain any benefits from Lil’ Red. Not to mention that it could still take on the cat form, which increased its speed. So he was unsure about who would win if they really fought.

“What is there to be surprised about?” Lil’ Purple plucked a leaf from the Phoenix Tree and rolled her eyes. “You couldn’t cultivate for six months, but Lil’ Red and I experienced life and death within Myriad Demon Peak, basking in the Myriad Beast Lake. Lil’ Red has already awakened 10% of its bloodline!”

“Hehe.” Lil’ Red was happy upon hearing Lil’ Purple’s evaluation.

Upon hearing that, Lin Yun turned to look at Lil’ Red, and he could feel that Lil’ Red had undergone a drastic transformation. He said, “The awakening of an ancient bloodline… Lil’ Red’s achievement is at least a saint beast in the future…”

“Not yet. Its attainments in the Ancient Dracoape Art and martial techniques are too low. Most importantly, just 10% of the ancient bloodline isn’t enough.” Lil’ Purple shook her head.

“The Ancient Dracoape Art might be slow to cultivate, but it will provide a sturdy foundation. As for its martial techniques, it’s fine with you around. As for its bloodline, I still have Demigod Wine with me. You two can drink however much you can later.” Lin Yun nodded.

As Lin Yun spoke, he retrieved the Demigod Wine from his interspatial bracelet. Lil’ Purple and Lil’ Red’s eyes lit up when he poured them a cup. Lil’ Red immediately returned to its cat form, wanting to gulp down the cup of Demigod Wine.

“What are you anxious about…” Lil’ Purple glared at Lil’ Red and stowed the wine cup. “Don’t keep praising Lil’ Red. It has to reach the fifth stage before consuming the Demigod Wine.”

Lil’ Red scratched its head because it did not dare to snatch the Demigod Wine from Lil’ Purple. It then sent a pitiful look at Lin Yun.

“I forgot that the effects of the first cup are the greatest. Listen to Lil’ Purple. Anyhow, the wine is with me, so you can drink it sooner or later.” Lin Yun said.

Only after hearing that did Lil’ Red let out a breath of relief.

“Work hard on cultivating because I might need your help in the Heavenly Dao Sect.”

Lil’ Red excitedly nodded its head upon hearing Lin Yun’s words before pitifully looking at the Demigod Wine, then leaving with great difficulty.

“The Heavenly Dao Sect… Are you still going to the Heavenly Dao Sect?” Lil’ Purple asked.

“I have come to an agreement with my senior brother.” Lin Yun nodded.

“Actually, I haven’t been wasting my time waiting for you. I feel that the Solar Lunar Divine Rune might be within the Heavenly Dao Sect.” Lil’ Purple said seriously.

“What are the odds?” Lin Yun’s eyes lit up.

“If you can enter the inner sect, I’ll have 90% confidence. But the Heavenly Dao Sect has strict guards, and you haven’t been showing up. So I didn’t dare to intrude upon the Heavenly Dao Sect…” Lil’ Purple said, looking at Lin Yun.

Lin Yun fell into deep thought. Each of the Divine Sovereign Runes were special, and the Solar Lunar Divine Rune was a very special one amongst the seven. Aside from being powerful, it could also bring the cycle of the sun and moon to the Iris Secret Realm. At that time, spiritual energy would gradually appear within the secret realm, and the growth of the Phoenix Tree would increase.

“Let’s wait for Senior Brother to come before entering the Heavenly Dao Sect.” Lin Yun said.

“Hehe, that’s a promise. With the Solar Lunar Divine Rune, the location of the other Divine Sovereign Runes will be clear.” Lil’ Purple said excitedly.

Lin Yun knew that Lil’ Purple had been looking for the location of the seven Divine Sovereign Runes. But this made him wonder if Lil’ Purple was bragging about her title as the Supreme Heavenly Slaughter Empress. Not to mention that even he could sense the sin within Lil’ Purple that stayed around, even after undergoing a rebirth.

But so what? Lin Yun smiled. He would only care about those he cared about, and the opinion of others had nothing to do with him. In his eyes, Lil’ Purple was only a little girl who liked to brag.

After leaving the Iris Secret Realm, Lin Yun took out a jade slip. This jade slip was left to him by his master, and his senior brother would be able to sense his location upon crushing it. Without any hesitation, Lin Yun crushed this jade slip.

When the jade slip was crushed, a faint light wandered on Lin Yun’s fingertips before disappearing. Now, he just had to wait, so he sat down to cultivate the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon and stabilize his cultivation in the first channel of the Profound Death Stage.

Three days later, when Lin Yun opened his eyes, a streak of light flew across the horizon, coming in his direction. When Lin Yun stood up, a powerful gale forced him to close his eyes, and he knew that his senior brother, Ye Guhan, had come.

When Ye Guhan landed on the ground, the powerful wind made Lin Yun’s clothes and hair violently flutter.

“Senior Brother!” Lin Yun took a step back and cupped his hands together. Ye Guhan wasn’t only his senior brother, but was also a Sword Saint who could confront Tian Xuanzi. He might seem young, but he had a high status, and Lin Yun naturally had to be respectful.

“You don’t have to be so courteous with me.” Ye Guhan squinted his eyes, examining Lin Yun. “You actually reached the Profound Death Stage? With your cultivation and your age of twenty-five, you can easily become a direct disciple of a Saint, and it’ll save you a lot of trouble.”

“What are the grades of the Heavenly Dao Sect’s direct disciples?” Lin Yun asked. In general, sect disciples would be divided into the outer sect, inner sect, direct disciple, saint disciple, and chief disciple.

“No need to hurry about that. I’ll explain it to you slowly.” Ye Guhan sat down and took out a jar of wine before he started explaining to Lin Yun.

“This is your identity starting from today.” After sharing the rules of the Heavenly Dao Sect with Lin Yun, Ye Guhan took out a portrait and handed it to Lin Yun.

When Lin Yun opened the portrait, a handsome youth soon appeared. This should be the disguise that his senior brother got him.

“This person is a descendant of the Ye Clan, but he was previously expelled from the Heavenly Dao Sect because he made a mistake. So you can use this identity to go to the Heavenly Dao Sect now.” Ye Guhan smiled with his eyes squinted.

“Ye Qingtian…” Lin Yun muttered. This name was pretty domineering.

“Where’s he?”

“Dead.” Ye Guhan said sorrowfully as he took a gulp of wine. “After being expelled from the Heavenly Dao Sect, he was humiliated upon returning to the clan. Due to that, he was anxious to make a breakthrough and lost his life because of that. But no one knows about his death now.”

“What did he do within the Heavenly Dao Sect?” Lin Yun asked.

“Uhhh…” Ye Guhan smiled. “That’s not important. You’ll know about it in the future when you return to the sect.”

Lin Yun had an ill premonition when he heard that, but there was nothing he could do about it since this identity was prepared by his senior brother.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“This is the last part of the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra, and I got this Netherflower from the Nether Sea for you. I was pretty lucky to obtain this Nine-Petaled Netherflower!” Ye Guhan took out a jade slip and a bewitching black flower.

“It’s really the Netherflower!” Lin Yun rejoiced when he saw the jade slip.

The cultivation of Divine Firmament Sword Sutra had a strong connection with nether energy and the Netherflower. But after the Nether Sea was smashed into fragments, it became hard to obtain nether energy and a Netherflower.

Due to that, the Divine Firmament Peak declined, so he was grateful that his senior brother personally travelled to the Nether Sea to obtain a Netherflower for him. He smiled, “Thank you, Senior Brother.”

“Don’t rejoice just yet because I have a piece of bad news for you.” Ye Guhan smiled.

“What is it?”

“I have to leave the Heavenly Dao Sect for a period of time.” Ye Guhan smiled.

Lin Yun’s face changed because this meant that this was important since Ye Guhan made a sudden change of plans. He asked, “Is it related to our master?”

“Yeah. I have to take a trip somewhere on behalf of our master, and I’m not sure how long it will be before I'm able to come back.” Ye Guhan nodded. He briefly paused before he smiled, “Actually, I’m not in the Heavenly Dao Sect most of the time.”

“Where is Senior Brother going this time?” Lin Yun asked curiously.

“Something related to the sword.” Ye Guhan stowed his smile and said with a grave expression.

“Haha, don’t worry about it. Before leaving, I must teach you something, or you might be bullied within the Heavenly Dao Sect.” Ye Guhan soon smiled and continued, “You should be able to handle the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra yourself. So I’ll teach you how to grasp the Sword Heart and Divine Firefly Sword. Release your Sword Heart.”
