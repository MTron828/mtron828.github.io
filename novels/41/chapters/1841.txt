Chapter 1842 - Black Tortoise Pool

Lin Yun opened his mouth. He was really speechless and wondered when that fellow could be reliable.

“A crown isn’t something that just anyone can touch. You overestimated yourself.” Gu Jun sneered with his eyes flickering, but no one knew what he was thinking.

“Elder Gu, do you have a solution?” An Liuyan was pretty calm, supporting Lin Yun with both her hands.

“I do.” Gu Jun replied.

“What is it?”

“This…” Gu Jun instantly became hesitant.

But Lin Yun could tell that this old man was probably bragging, and he said, “Liuyan, come and give it a try.”

An Liuyan possessed the White Dragon Bone, and she was a woman. So she naturally had a higher chance than Mei Zihua. Lin Yun speculated that only women of the Dragon Clan could touch it.

If An Liuyan couldn’t remove it, he could only think of another solution. Anyhow, Gu Jun was too unreliable for him to trust.

“Young Master, bear with it for now.” An Liuyan nodded and signaled Lin Yun to lower his head. She then took a deep breath in the dim surroundings before stepping forth. When she came in contact with the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown, lightning began to flicker on the crown but it didn’t shake her away.

This surprised Gu Jun, but he fell into deep thought before nodding his head. This brought joy to An Liuyan’s pupils, but she was calm and activated the White Dragon Bone while slowly lifting the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown with her boundless dragon origin.

Her movements were slow with her forehead covered in beads of sweat. But she firmly stood on the ground, and anyone could tell it wasn’t easy for her. She was bearing great pressure when she tried to remove the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown from Lin Yun’s head.

The moment the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown left his head, Lin Yun took a step back and stood up before taking the crown from An Liuyan’s hands. An Liuyan’s face instantly became pale before she collapsed to the ground. Lin Yun reached out and gently took her into his embrace.

“Are you okay?” Lin Yun asked.

As An Liuyan’s chest heaved to catch her breath, her face had a charming blush. She replied, “It’s good as long as the young master is fine.”

On the other hand, Gu jun had disdain on his face upon seeing this couple and couldn’t help cursing Lin Yun for being a scumbag.

“I nearly lost my life today because of it.” Lin Yun smiled, looking at the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown in his hand.

“But also because of it, we obtained two treasures.” An Liuyan smiled.

Lin Yun nodded his head and put away the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown to briefly rest. A brief moment later, Lin Yun opened his eyes and had almost recovered under the Blue Dragon Bone, but Gu Jun was still feeling a little weak. That drop of heart blood affected him too greatly, and the woman was really ruthless.

“You already know about that woman?” Lin Yun asked.

“I don’t, but I can tell she’s terrifying. She sends a chill down my spine, unlike Boss An.” Gu Jun sighed.

“Elder Gu, you’re being too polite.” An Liuyan smiled.

“Let’s go, then.” Lin Yun found Mei Zihua’s location.

When Mei Zihua woke up, he body was still aching as lightning flickered throughout his body. The corner of his lips twitched, “Where am I…?”

Seeing him like this made Lin Yun feel heartache for him. After all, Mei Zihua was injured because he was anxious to save Lin Yun. He asked, “Young Master Mei, are you alright?”

“Young Master Mei? Who’s Young Master Mei?” Mei Zihua asked in a trance-like state.

“Alright, he has officially become a fool.” Gu Jun said with disdain.

“Alright, let’s quickly leave this place. Who knows when the white-clothed man and woman might show up. Where’s the Demigod Wine Cellar? Lead the way.” Lin Yun looked around.

Far away, there was still an intense ongoing battle in the hall. Judging from the looks, they should be fighting for some time, and no one knew who would be the ultimate winner. The last Glory Saint Artifact was inside, which Lin Yun left behind on purpose. With that Glory Saint Artifact, they would have to fight for a long time and wouldn’t disturb him. But that white-clothed man and woman were an uncertain factor.

“Come with me.” Gu Jun said with a grave expression. He asked, “Where’s that fool?”

“Liuyan, look after him. I’ll lead the way.” Lin Yun said after a brief pondering. Only he still had the strength to fight amongst the four of them, so he didn’t have a choice. After all, he couldn’t abandon Mei Zihua here.

 

While Lin Yun’s group of four went to look for the Demigod Wine Cellar, the battle in the vault reached its climax. The Fire God General and the man wearing a bamboo hat were heavily injured, so the last Glory Saint Artifact was obtained by Xiao Yuanqi and Ji Lingfeng, who joined hands together.

The remaining treasures were divided amongst everyone else. The three God Generals obtained roughly three to five treasures, and they could only watch as everyone else competed for the other treasures. This naturally made the Fire God General reluctant to give up, but his injuries were serious and there was nothing he could do to kill everyone here.

“Let’s leave this place.” The Fire God General’s face was terrifyingly dark.

“Big Brother, are we going to leave just like that? These are all treasures…” Ao Feng and Yan Cangming were reluctant to give up.

“It’s fine to let them keep them for the time being. These people have already been taught a lesson, and no one can stop the rise of the Blood God Sect.” The Fire God General coldly looked at everyone with a hint of ferocity in his pupils.

When he finished speaking, he turned around and left. He initially thought the Black Tortoise Void Sea was a stage for him, but he never expected that it would become a shackle for him instead. If he wasn’t in the Black Tortoise Void Sea, Lin Yun wouldn’t be able to do anything to him, even if he had the Golden-Purple Dragon Crown.

Thinking about it, the Fire God General’s face sank, and he clenched his right fist. At the same time, the Ming Cult’s people slowly left with Yu Wenxiu’s corpse.

Among the six holy lands, they suffered the greatest loss. Not only did they fail to obtain anything, Yu Wenxiu even died here in front of so many people.

On a stone pillar, Xiao Yuanqi and Ji Lingfeng stood together, side by side. The two might have obtained a Glory Saint Artifact, but they didn’t have any joy on their faces. Ji Lingfeng even sighed, “Brother Lin has offended too many people this time, I wonder if he can get away…”

“Yu Wenxiu actually died just like that…” Xiao Yuanqi sighed. He was still in a trance.

“He deserved it, thinking that he was smart. If I was Lin Xiao, I would’ve killed him as well.” Ji Lingfeng had a similar temper to Lin Yun, and he also had no good impression of Yu Wenxiu.

“Let’s just hope that Brother Lin can arrive sooner. The Fire God General won’t let this matter rest so easily.” Xiao Yuanqi said.

Qin Cang laid on the ground and fell into deep thoughts while looking at the bone flute given to him by the woman. But he had lost his interest to compete for the other treasures.

 

The Black Thunder Saint Palace was like a maze. Under Gu Jun’s leadership, Lin Yun and An Liuyan came to an underground palace. They couldn’t imagine that there was such an underground palace beneath the Black Thunder Saint Palace. The underground palace was unexpectedly empty, and there wasn’t anything else aside from paintings on the wall.

An hour later, everyone could smell a faint aroma from the surroundings.

“Wine!” Mei Zihua woke up, and his expression became clear. His pupils were shining brightly as he looked in a direction. After all, Mei Zihua’s mental energy was a lot stronger than Lin Yun's. He also had a keen sense when it came to alcohol, so he could sense something others couldn’t.

“He actually woke up!” Gu Jun was somewhat disappointed after seeing Mei Zihua. After all, he planned to bluff a few treasures from Mei Zihua when his conscious wasn’t clear.

“Hehe. Come, follow me. This place is also arranged according to the Star Formation Art.” Mei Zihua became energetic, and he headed in a direction.Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“This brat got it right again!” Gu Jun was surprised.

Lin Yun and An Liuyan followed behind Mei Zihua, and it didn’t take long for them to arrive at the Demigod Wine Cellar. When they entered the Demigod Wine Cellar, they could see countless wine bottles filling their sight, and An Liuyan was feeling a little dizzy with her face blushing as though she was drunk.

Lin Yun squinted his eyes and saw that this ancient wine cellar was massive. It was much larger than the wine cellar he found in the past. At the center of the wine cellar, there was a pool. The diameter of the pool was about a hundred feet, and there was a vivid Black Tortoise statue at the heart of the pool with water gushing out of it.

There were also ten-odd lightning snake statues around the Black Tortoise statue with water gushing out from their mouths. As the water gushed out from their mouths, those thunder snakes were swimming around, looking extremely horrifying.

By the poolside, there was a crystal statue of a woman placing a jade flute by her lips. At every corner of the wine cellar.

There were many tightly sealed wine cabinets in every corner of the wine cellar, and the cabinets had many exquisite wine jars and cups. There were those made of crystals, porcelains, jades, and metals. Many jars and wine bottles were treasures, and anyone could tell that they were extraordinary. They were probably all spatial treasures.

Lin Yun swept his gaze and became interested in the pool because it seemed to be connected to various wine cabinets. If one looked at it as an entity, it would look like a complicated array with many complicated saint runes.

As for the crystal statue, Lin Yun could feel that this statue wasn’t ordinary. There seemed to be divine runes within the statue. Could this be the method used for brewing saint wines?

“This entire wine cellar is an array. The moment it’s activated, it can brew various wines, and it’s really weird. This seems to be the method of the Mo Clan.” Mei Zihua exclaimed.

“This is the Demigod Wine Cellar?” Lin Yun asked with his pupils shining brightly with excitement.

“Brother Lin, why don’t I play a song first and see if I can cause a rapport with the crystal statue? Who knows, maybe it might be activated.” Mei Zihua said in excitement, unable to contain his emotion.

“Don’t!” But as soon as he finished speaking, Lin Yun, Gu Jun, and An Liuyan’s faces change.

The wine was Gu Jun’s life, and he glared at Me Zihua, “Brat, I’ll kill you if you mess around. Do you think only you have grasped the Great Saint Tune? Lin Xiao defeated you at the Nirvana Banquet, but did he say anything?”

“I’m only asking about it casually.” Mei Zihua awkwardly smiled.

Lin Yun looked around, and saw that there were words on the wine cabinet. He saw Incineration Moon, Dragonflame Wine, Thundercloud Wine, and many others. There was no doubt that they were all exquisite wines. Not to mention he even saw the Millennium Flame!

“Old man, is there any of the demigod wine you mentioned?” Lin Yun asked.

“There is!” Gu Jun said with certainty. He immediately got rid of his weakened state and became excited the moment Lin Yun mentioned demigod wine. This place was the sacred ground of the Thunder Black Tortoise’s lineage, and this place was a forbidden ground from a hundred thousand years ago. The demigod wine was the greatest secret.

Others only knew about the Black Tortoise Vault, but many people didn’t know about the Demigod Wine Cellar. According to the rumors, demigod wines were extremely precious. It could allow you to enter a certain state to grasp a higher level of martial intent, and it could also prolong one’s lifespan.

If someone took a few sips, even someone at the Samsara Edict Realm had a high chance of reaching the Quasi-Saint in a short while. As for those who were already at the Quasi-Saint Realm, they would have a 30% chance of reaching the Saint Realm. It might only seem like 30%, but one would stand at the top of the pyramid after reaching the Saint Realm.

After all, anyone beneath the Saint Realm were all ants. This was a transcendent realm, and many people would be stuck, unable to reach the Saint Realm for centuries or even a millennium.
