Chapter 593 - Scheme

In a valley located at the Withernorth Sea, an old man and a young man were facing off. The old man was a demonic cultivator and his cultivation was in the pinnacle Yang stage. However, he wasn’t in an optimistic position as the youth he was fighting with didn’t even draw his sword.

During the intense fight, the elder took a palm to his chest and threw up blood. He was shocked by the azure-clothed youth in front of him. If Lin Yun was here, he would naturally recognize the youth.

It was Bai Lixuan who was once known as the strongest genius in the Sword Firmament Pavilion. But right now, he was White of the Cloud Trigram Sect. Bai Lixuan had the saint physique and he also had shocking talent in swords. However, he managed to force the old man to such a terrible state without using his sword.

“You have already taken the Flamecloud Fruit, so why are you still antagonizing me,” said the old man as he clutched his chest. His eyes were flickering with killing aura.

“I’m not killing you because of the Flamecloud Fruit. I would be letting down the three months I spent in the Cloud Trigram Sect if I let you go,” said Bai Lixuan calmly. He had just entered the greater Yang stage recently and there was a huge gap between him and the wandering cultivator in the pinnacle Yang stage.

Even if the old man couldn’t defeat Bai Lixuan, it shouldn’t be a problem for him to escape. But Bai Lixuan spoke confidently that it was impossible for the old man to leave, which was shocking.

“What arrogance! You think you can stop me from leaving?” The old man turned around and began to run.

“Wouldn’t it be a joke if you could escape after taking my palm?” Bai Lixuan finally drew his sword, which forced the old man back. After another sword flash, a huge gash appeared on the old man’s chest as he yelled out in pain.

“Die!” Not giving the old man any opportunities, Bai Lixuan flashed forward and stabbed his sword out. The old man’s throat was instantly pierced through.

Retracting his wrist, Bai Lixuan waved his sword and flicked the blood onto the ground. Just as soon as he finished wiping his sword, a figure descended from the sky and smiled, “It wasn’t easy finding you. Not bad, you can even kill a pinnacle Yang stage wandering cultivator.”

The figure was Bai Lixuan’s senior brother Xie Yunqiao, a core disciple of the Cloud Trigram Sect. He was also a monster ranked fifty-seven on the Dragoncloud Ranking.

“He’s just a wandering cultivator, not to mention that he’s not on the Wandering Cultivator Ranking,” said Bai Lixuan as he sheathed his sword.

“You’re being too humble,” smiled Xie Yunqiao. He was optimistic of this junior brother of his. According to his estimates, if all went according to plan, Bai Lixuan would surely shine brightly on the Draconic Banquet. Even he was anxious about Bai Lixuan’s aptitude.

“I saw Lin Yun,” said Bai Lixuan as he tried his best to maintain his composure. They saw each other before entering the Withernorth Sea. However, both of them had different thoughts when they saw each other.

Xie Yunqiao smiled, “I saw him as well. Don’t worry about it, there’s no way he can beat you now. Since you joined the Cloud Trigram Sect, you’ll improve faster than him. This trip to the empyrean’s tomb will not only make you famous, but we’ll also get you the Astral Pearl from the deceased empyrean.”

Bai Lixuan fell into deep thoughts and sighed, “But the trauma he gave me is too great. Indeed, I have nothing to be afraid about. With so many experts from the Dragoncloud Ranking here, he’s no longer my target.”

“That’s right. If you run into him, it’s enough to just teach him a lesson. There’s no need to pay any attention to him anymore. Let’s go, the empyrean’s tomb is still far away,” smiled Xie Yunqiao.

At the same time, Lin Yun, who they were talking about, was arrigin at an ancient sect’s ruins. The appearance of the crumbled building was shocking. Settling inside a hall, Lin Yun hid himself well and placed the sword box down.

Looking at the sword box, Lin Yun opened it up and a dense flower fragrance blew towards him. There were over thirty petals in the box, which filled half of the box.

Pulling out the Flower Burial Sword, Lin Yun looked at the natural runes on it. Right now, one-third of the runes were lit up. Once all of the runes were lit up, his sword should be able to upgrade to a cosmic artifact. If the Flower Burial Sword could be upgraded into a cosmic artifact, there was no doubt that Lin Yun’s trump card in the empyrean’s tomb would increase by one.

“There are still two-thirds of the runes left. I have to find a way,” said Lin Yun as he fell into deep thoughts with his brows furrowed. Aside from the Seven Colored Duskmist Flowers, Duskmist Flowers should be common. However, it was too troublesome for him to search by himself.

Judging things by his current pace, he might not be able to upgrade the sword before reaching the empyrean’s tomb. As Lin Yun pondered, ideas quickly flew through his mind. Shortly after, Lin Yun released his grab on the sword because he had an idea.

He slowly closed his eyes and circulated the Iris Sword Sutra. As his origin energy fluctuated within his body ferociously, he began to pour it into the sword.

When he poured his origin energy into the sword, the Flower Burial Sword began to buzz. When it accumulated origin energy to its limit, Lin Yun suddenly opened his eyes and grabbed the sword. The Flower Burial Sword flashed like a silver beam as it soared into the sky.

Swinging his sword, Lin Yun plunged the Flower Burial Sword into the ground. As the sword trembled violently, some of the nearby ancient constructs began to collapse. The silver beam was dazzling and caused a huge commotion.

“What powerful sword intent! It must be an ancient treasure!”

“What a huge commotion…”

“Let’s go. Get there immediately!” In the blink of an eye, everyone in the surrounding area began to rush over to the silver beam. Since the surroundings were ancient constructs, many people were around looking for treasures. They were naturally attracted by the silver beam.

The Flower Burial Sword had a huge origin, to begin with. Even if it wasn’t an ancient treasure, it was comparable to such treasures. From a certain angle, those people weren’t wrong.

In just a few breaths’ time, Lin Yun noticed two silhouettes dashing in his direction. The two were extremely cautious and their eyes lit up when they saw the Flower Burial Sword. However, they didn’t act impulsively.

They both noticed each other. One was a core disciple of a quasi-overlord force with a cultivation in the greater Yang stage, while the other was a middle-aged wandering cultivator who was nearly two meters in height. They kept their guards up against each other and they also turned to look at the Flower Burial Sword.

The silvery ancient sword was covered in some dust from the ruins, but even so, they could tell that it was a flawless ancient sword. That alone would put a huge price on the sword.

Just as the two of their hearts jolted with excitement, they both noticed Lin Yun’s presence. The sect’s disciple who was dressed in yellow was surprised as he barked, “You must be the one to discover this ancient sword, right? You can get lost now!”

As he spoke, many figures also rushed over as their eyes lit up when they saw the sword.

“It’s really an ancient sword!” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“The sword intent is still here even after so many years. This sword must have a huge origin!”

“There must have been a huge battle in the past. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be reduced to a profound artifact.” Discussions began to sound out from the surroundings.

“Why the hell are you still here?” The middle-aged man barked when he saw that Lin Yun wasn’t moving. He had reached a mutual understanding with the disciple in yellow to chase Lin Yun and everyone else away before fighting for the treasure.

Otherwise, they weren’t certain who would be attracted by the sword.

Facing the two, Lin Yun smiled, “This sword belongs to me, to begin with. The reason why I caused such a huge commotion is because I need everyone’s help.”

His words instantly left them shocked because they had no idea what Lin Yun was planning. Even the sect’s disciple in yellow and the middle-aged man were shocked.

“Don’t believe me?” Lin Yun retracted his smile as the Flower Burial Sword flew into his hand. This left the youth in yellow and the middle-aged man shocked as they quickly dashed forward.

“This sword might belong to you, but not for long!”

“A trash in the Yin stage like you isn’t qualified to own this sword!” The two leaked their killing aura as they charged at Lin Yun. Clearly, they had no intention of letting Lin Yun off.

In the split second that Lin Yun held onto the Flower Burial Sword, he also charged at the pair. It looked like Lin Yun was about to be killed by them. However, two streaks of blood cut through the air and they dropped to their knees while clutching their chests.

“How is this possible?!” The two looked at Lin Yun with shock and disbelief. They didn’t even see how Lin Yun attacked.

Lin Yun then swept his glance around. Those who caught his gaze could feel a chill run down their spines and fear began to spread out in their hearts. “Leave behind three Duskmist Flowers or you can forget about leaving this place alive. For those without Duskmist Flowers, you can leave your interspatial pouches behind and redeem them after you find the flowers.”
