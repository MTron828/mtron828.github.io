Chapter 2469 - Guardian, Yu Qingfeng

The news of Yu Qingfeng’s approaching death enveloped the Skysolute City in a sorrowful atmosphere. The process gave his comprehension back to heaven and earth to benefit the world. This was the Skysolute City’s tradition, and the sword mound beneath the city was where famous swordsmen died.

When Lin Yun heard that, he was still writing down all the techniques he had forgotten before engraving them onto jade slips. There were various techniques, ranging from weak to high. There were techniques as weak as the Flowing Wind Sword and Thunderclap Sword Art, but there were also powerful techniques like Nirvana and Yin-Yang Daos.

Liu Wuxie analyzed it deeply, giving the potential for each technique to strengthen, and he engraved a few hundred jade slips. As for Lil’ Purple, she was crafting lamps according to his instruction, using the Phoenix Tree’s saint liquid as oil.

“The Sword Emperor is going to die?” The one who delivered the news to Lin Yun was the Dao Suspend Sword Saint, which Lin Yun didn’t believe.

The Dao Suspend Sword Saint nodded and continued, “Master hopes you can climb to the summit by yourself, and he wants to meet you before his death.”

The Dao Suspend Sword Saint wore a grave expression. Even if he had his speculations, he still couldn’t contain the sorrow in his heart.

Lin Yun wanted to tell him that Yu Qingfeng was outside Kunlun Realm, and dissolving into dao wasn’t death to him. But Yu Qingfeng didn’t want anyone to know since he said nothing. Thus, Lin Yun had to comfort the Dao Suspend Sword Saint.

Squeezing out a smile, the Dao Suspend Sword Saint smiled bitterly, “Flower Burial, you don’t have to comfort me. I have predicted this day. It’s impossible even for those in the Emperor Realm to climb the summit, and you better ask your master for a solution. Since my master wants to meet you, he must have something he wants to tell you, and the path to the summit was a test.”

“I got it.” Lin Yun nodded. Looking at the Dao Suspend Sword Saint leaving, Lin Yun said, “Lil’ Purple, you carry on with the lamps and jade slips. I’ll go look for master.”

Nodding her head, Lil’ Purple asked curiously, “Lin Yun, why do you want to make these?”

“That’s a secret,” Lin Yun smiled.

When Lin Yun left, Lil’ Purple pouted furiously, “What a miser.”

But Lil’ Purple still did her best to make each lamp exquisite, so much so that she even engraved saint runes on them.

When Lin Yun met his master, his master was in low spirits and still hadn’t walked out from the battle entirely. This naturally surprised Lin Yun, and he could sense a majestic sword aura coming from his master. This sword aura gave him a feeling to bow and show his respect. This was the aura of a Sword Emperor.

Lin Yun soon recovered from his shock, which should be an inheritance from Yu Qingfeng. However, his master had just inherited it and couldn’t control it as he wished, like Yu Qingfeng.

The Sword Emperor was a title that initially belonged to the middle-aged man in Heavenly Dao Sect, whose soul dissipated on the assault to the Heavenly Dao Sect. But Yu Qingfeng snatched it away, and it ended up on his master. Then again, these three were worthy of that title. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“You noticed?” The Radiant Sword Emperor asked, looking at Lin Yun.

Nodding his head, Lin Yun said, “I saw it. I can see the majestic sword aura of the Sword Emperor’s status on you.”

The Radiant Sword Emperor sighed, “I now understand that Yu Qingfeng is seeking death, and he has been waiting for me.”

The Radiant Sword Emperor’s feelings for Yu Qingfeng were complicated. But he gradually knew that Yu Qingfeng wasn’t a bad person. The Sword Sect might not have an Emperor, but everyone knew that Yu Qingfeng was standing behind the Sword Sect, and he was a mythical emperor.

Looking at Lin Yun, the Radiant Sword Emperor’s eyes became wet, and he said, “Lin Yun, Yu Qingfeng...said that he was my guardian!”

The Radiant Sword Emperor finally understood many things. Without Yu Qingfeng, the Sword Sect wouldn’t be able to last till now, and he wouldn’t be able to come this far.

Lin Yun was stumped upon hearing it. But thinking about it again, Yu Qingfeng was his master’s guardian, protecting and supporting him in the dark. Without Yu Qingfeng, his master couldn’t come this far because the other holy lands in the Eastern Desolation had Emperors. He instantly understood why his master was so sad, making him hesitate.

“You have something to speak?” The Radiant Sword Emperor asked.

“I do have something to say. Master, you don’t have to be sad about it. Yu Qingfeng...” Lin Yun took a deep breath.

“What about it?” The Radiant Sword Emperor quickly asked.

Lin Yun recalled what Yu Qingfeng looked like when he was outside Kunlun Realm, a prideful youth with a smile and a carefree life. He ultimately decided to tell his master about meeting Yu Qingfeng outside Kunlun Realm and even fought a Sword Immortal.

“Master, he’s living a carefree life, becoming brothers with a young man, stealing drinks in the Ancestral Deity’s sect, and challenging a Sword Immortal. He even named himself Feng Qingyu,” Lin Yun smiled bitterly. “I was also fooled by him, who said he admired me at our first meeting.”

The Radiant Sword Emperor was stumped when he heard that. But after a brief pondering, he smiled, “That seems like him. Hahaha, is that his clone?”

“He doesn’t look like a clone to me. His body is seventeen or eighteen years old, and he said it was his opportunity. I reckon that the one in Kunlun Realm is a clone instead,” Lin Yun said, shaking his head.

The Sword Emperor’s smile froze, and he asked, “So...the one I fought for seven days and nights is only a clone of his?”

Lin Yun fell silent. He already had his speculation, but he didn’t say it as it would only affect his master’s mindset if he said it early. The reason why he told his master about it was because he didn’t want to see his master so sad.

The Radiant Sword Emperor smiled bitterly a long time later, “No wonder I can’t see through him. That’s something that only someone like him can do. What boldness to give out the title of a Sword Emperor willingly.”

“Master, did you two manage to find the answer you were seeking?” Lin Yun changed the topic.

The Radiant Sword Emperor pondered and said, “I saw a crack when Yu Qingfeng slammed himself at the gate. I had some harvest, and he should be able to see more than me. Perhaps he has already comprehended the sword intent beyond the ninth-grade.”

Lin Yun asked, “So, I’ll go to the summit?”

“He should have some inheritance for you or the path he saw beyond the gate,” the Radiant Sword Emperor said. He continued, “The path to the summit is a test. If you can walk through it, you will have the strength to compete with Emperors. This meant that the inheritance he wanted to give you requires you to have the strength of an Emperor to accept.”

“Master, do you have anything you want me to tell him on your behalf?” Lin Yun asked with a grave expression.

The Radiant Sword Emperor smiled, “Others might feel that the path is dangerous for you, but there won’t be any danger with the Iris Sword Box, Heavenly Dragon Divine Physique, and Heavenly Desolate Sword Intent.”

Lin Yun's eyes shone, and instantly understood what his master meant. He asked, “That means I can climb to the summit?”

“You can. If you use the Iris Sword Box, there won’t be any difficulty. But I suggest you not use your Heavenly Dragon Divine Physique and Iris Sword Box, but your Heavenly Desolate Sword Intent,” the Radiant Sword Emperor said. “When you reach the summit, your Heavenly Desolate Sword Intent will reach the pinnacle, and this is what Yu Qingfeng probably wanted.”

“Okay!” Lin Yun quickly made up his mind.

Three days later, Lin Yun handed the Iris Sword Box to Lil’ Purple, planning to climb the mountain relying on his sword intent.

“Are you not going to bring the Iris Sword Box and merely use your sword intent?” The Lil’ Purple asked nervously. “I heard that even Emperors died along the way, and it will be dangerous.”

Stroking his nose, Lin Yun smiled, “I’m not that stubborn. I won’t hesitate to use the Heavenly Dragon Divine Physique if I can't bear it. With the Heavenly Dragon Bone, it’s hard for me to die even if I’m not in the Emperor Realm.”

What Lin Yun said wasn’t wrong. His physique was stronger than the Emperor's, even if he wasn’t in the Emperor's Realm. Furthermore, the Heavenly Dragon Divine Physique was still transforming, slowly fusing into his body. It was a matter of time before he became comparable to pure-blooded Heavenly Dragons.

When Lin Yun stepped on the path, he released his sword, which turned into a pillar of light, soaring to the sky and shattering the layers of heaven. As he walked, the crack in the sky gradually expanded with starlight shining down.

This instantly drew the attention of countless swordsmen in the Skysolute City, and they looked at that pillar of light.

“The Sword Emperor’s title was given to Radiant, but he left his true inheritance for Lin Yun.”

“I wonder what Yu Qingfeng saw. The sword intent beyond the ninth-grade has always been a legend.”

“It made no sense for Yu Qingfeng to dissolve himself to dao when he’s so young, not to mention the Empress decided to hold the deification ceremony half a month from now.”

All the swordsmen began to discuss this sensitive topic, the Empress’ deification ceremony. Everyone in the world knew that Lin Yun would go to the ceremony and fight the Empress.

With Yu Qingfeng’s strength, he must’ve left something behind to help Lin Yun. No one knew why Yu Qingfeng suddenly wanted to dissolve himself into dao, but Lin Yun might know why after meeting him.
