Chapter 2190: The Cold Night

The moon hung high in the sky, and the night was quieter than usual within the Heavenly Dao Sect today with disciples from the vicarious peaks restrained and prohibited from going out.

There was a graceful figure in front of the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda. It was Wang Muyan, whom Lin Yun was worried about. The Heavenly Wheel Pagoda was the most precious treasure and foundation of the Heavenly Dao Sect. It was the reason why disciples in the Heavenly Dao Sect could rise to prominence in a short time. Otherwise, they wouldn’t be able to compete with the geniuses from the other holy lands.

But even a time-space treasure had its limits, which was consuming a large number of saint crystals. Saint crystals weren’t that rare, but they were costly in high amounts. At the very least, powerful sects couldn’t afford them.

As for divine crystals, they weren’t just rare because the value could be comparable with Divine Blood Fruits. The Heavenly Wheel Pagoda was the forbidden ground of the sect, and no one could get close to it unless they were saint disciples. Not to mention that there were many saints guarding it.

But there wasn’t a Great Saint here because no one would imagine that someone could subdue the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda. Even a Great Saint couldn’t subdue the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda, and they might be heavily injured instead. So in the eyes of many people, the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda couldn’t be moved like the Dao Yang Mountain and Heavenly Yin Mountain. It was deeply rooted, and even a Great Saint wouldn’t dare to place any ideas on the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda.

But today, Wang Muyan came here alone to subdue the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda.

“Divine Maiden!” The moment Wang Muyan appeared, the Heavenly Yi Saint Lord, who was responsible for guarding the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda, appeared. He showed a respectful look towards Wang Muyan.

If Lin Yun saw this scene, he would definitely be shocked that a noble Saint Elder was a member of the Blood Moon Sect. But he would be able to notice something if he thought about it carefully because the Heavenly Yi Saint Lord treated Wang Muyan too well.

“How long do I have?” Wang Muyan asked, looking at the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda.

“Six hours. I don’t know why, but many of the Saint Elders who were guarding here were summoned to the Dao Yang Palace,” the Heavenly Yi Saint Lord replied. Aside from three Saint Lords who were responsible for guarding this place on the surface, there were ten-odd Saints guarding it in the dark, and they would rotate every fifteen days. The rotation would last four hours each time, but there was a special situation today. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

This should be a secret, but the Heavenly Yi Saint Lord was on her side, and he naturally knew about her. Among the Saints stationed here, the Heavenly Yi Saint Lord was a member of the Blood Moon Sect and an elder of the Ye Clan. There was also another Saint who had a good relationship with the Wang Clan, and he could be considered on their side as well.

So their concern would be the Saint Elders who were on rotation because it wasn’t fixed, and the Wang Clan couldn’t control the rotation. The Heavenly Dao Sect might not be afraid that the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda would be stolen, but it was strictly guarded.

Logically speaking, even a Great Saint wouldn’t be able to obtain any benefits if they came here. So thirteen Saints could protect the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda well with the spiritual array here. But a fortress could naturally be broken from within, not to mention that no one paid much attention to Wang Muyan.

“Six hours…” Wang Muyan calculated that she could stay on the seventh level for two months, which was barely enough. The last time she was there, she stayed at the seventh level for two years, and she had awakened the incomplete memories of the artifact spirit.

The Heavenly Wheel Pagoda used to be a treasure of the Blood Moon Sect. But after the Blood Moon Sect was wiped out in ancient times, it was snatched away by the Heavenly Dao Sect’s sect master.

As a result, the Heavenly Dao Sect was known to be the strongest sect for a long time with branches throughout the Kunlun Realm. The branches were all holy lands, but the Heavenly Dao Sect lost control of those branches after they declined, but that was a story for another time.

If the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda wasn’t a treasure of the Blood Moon Sect, there was no way for Wang Muyan to subdue it. She calmly stepped into the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda, swiftly reaching the seventh level. There was also a Saint guarding here, but it was an elder of the Wang Clan, and Wang Muyan handed a small fragment of the divine crystal to him. To activate the array on the seventh level, divine crystals were needed, and the divine crystal that was the size of a nail was incredibly valuable.

“Young Missy, be careful,” the Wang Clan’s Saint Elder said.

Wang Muyan entered the seventh level a brief moment later. This was the core of the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda. There were mountains and rivers, with the saint aura forming into a fog that spread to each corner. Many precious saint elixirs could also be found here.

Whenever Wang Muyan took a step, her appearance would change, as though she was shedding her skin. This was the Thousand-Faced Demonic Art, and it didn’t literally mean having a thousand faces. She only had one face, but everyone would look at her differently because they would find their dream lover on her. If one didn’t have a firm will, they would fall in love with her.

This was because she could satisfy the fantasy of every man, and she could see the deepest desire in everyone’s eyes. She had formed a relationship with many people, but they were all illusions after they were controlled by the Thousand-Faced Demonic Art. It’s just that the illusions looked realistic in the eyes of others.

Whenever Wang Muyan took a step, she would shed some skin, which was the side effects of the Thousand-Faced Demonic Art. Even if it was the imagination of others, the faces would form into illusions overlapping on her. But now, she was going to reveal her true appearance and undo the seal of the mysterious power within her body. The mysterious power was so ancient that even Lil’ Purple was afraid of it.

She ultimately came before an indigo flower. This was an Udumbara Flower that has lived for tens of thousands of years. The Udumbara Flower then manifested into a young lady’s appearance in front of Wang Muyan. This was the artifact spirit of the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda, You Luo.

“You Luo greets master.”

In front of You Luo was a completely different Wang Muyan. This face wasn’t just perfect, but was charming and even had a hint of divinity. Whenever people looked at her, she would look so sacred that no one would have the intention of committing blasphemy against her.

This was also the problem that troubled Lin Yun for a long time because he could occasionally sense a hint of divinity coming from Wang Muyan. But if he looked at Wang Muyan now, he would sense that she was filled with divinity, especially when she undid the seal within her body. A terrifying aura swept out from her that even intimidate a Saint.

“I only have two months, so I need the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda to operate for me within those two months,” Wang Muyan said indifferently.

You Luo looked as though she was placed in a difficult position, before she said, “I’m afraid that it will be difficult. Master’s cultivation isn’t strong enough to control the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda, so you can’t control the full power of it, even if you have gained the pagoda’s acknowledgment. If you forcibly try to control it, there is going to be a backlash.”

It was normal that someone couldn’t unleash the full power of a treasure if they didn’t have sufficient cultivation, and they would even suffer the backlash of it. It was just like how Lin Yun forcibly used a Sovereign Saint Artifact in the past, and he would have killed himself if he wasn’t careful. Although he wouldn’t be injured if he used it now, he couldn’t unleash the full power of the Azure Dragon Sun-Moon Umbrella.

“That’s enough,” Wang Muyan said calmly with crimson flames blazing within her eyes. The flames converged into two mysterious runes that gave off a powerful intimidation.

“Okay.” You Luo didn’t say anything further. She had regained her identity after her memories were restored, and she would only obey this person in front of her.

While Wang Muyan was trying to control the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda, the Gale Rein Great Saint and Tough Peak Saint Sovereign were having a nervous discussion within the Heavenly Yin Palace’s main hall.

“Gale Rein Great Saint, is he dead?” The Tough Peak Saint Sovereign asked nervously. He was afraid of the Thousand Plume Great Saint, and this fear was deeply etched into his bones that couldn’t be forgotten. If not for the Thousand Plume Great Saint, the four major clans would’ve gained control of the Heavenly Dao Sect long ago.

The Gale Rein Great Saint smiled, “Even if he’s not dead, how much strength do you think he has left after suffering that sword? It’s uncertain if he’s even awake now.”

“But…” The Tough Peak Saint Sovereign hesitated.

The Gale Rein Great Saint knew what the Tough Peak Great Saint was trying to say. The latter was afraid that the Thousand Plume Great Saint would come after him in the end. As long as the Thousand Plume Great Saint wasn’t dead, the Tough Peak Saint Sovereign wouldn’t openly dare to rebel. After all, what they were about to do was betraying their ancestors and destroying the Heavenly Dao Sect.

“Don’t worry about it. I want him dead more than you do,” the Gale Rein Great Saint said. “I will personally make a trip to the Dao Yang Palace, and he will die no matter what.”

The Tough Peak Saint Sovereign was shocked, and asked, “There are three Great Saints in the Dao Yang Holy Palace, and you’re going there yourself?”
