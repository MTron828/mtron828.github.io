Chapter 526 - Infernal Flower

At Gu Teng’s residence, the door suddenly burst open. Gu Teng, who was drinking wine, quickly looked at the door. When he saw who it was, his face changed drastically. The wine bottle that he was holding fell to the ground, shattering into small pieces.

“B-big Brother, what brings you here?” asked Gu Teng with a trembling voice. The person who burst through the door was naturally Gu Feng, who was mocked by all the core disciples back in the Hearwind Pavilion. Gu Feng was wearing black and had a grim face.

On his right was a youth donned in blue, who was also wearing the core disciple uniform. He was also in the greater Yin stage, but his aura was a lot weaker than Gu Feng’s. He followed Gu Feng around like a lackey.

“Senior Brother Gu, your younger brother looks like he got beat up,” smiled the blue-clothed youth. Right now, Gu Teng didn’t have the grace that belonged to one of the strongest inner disciples. He looked more like a piece of trash instead. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“You piece of trash. I was embarrassed because of you! So, why can’t I be here? I’ve become the laughingstock of the core disciples!” Gu Feng’s eyes flashed coldly as he was filled with rage. He was filled with humiliation from what happened back in the Hearwind Pavilion. At that time, he wanted to slaughter Lin Yun immediately, but he calmed himself down and came to visit his younger brother first.

“Big Brother, I’ve embarrassed you,” said Gu Teng as he fell to his knees.

The blue-clothed youth helped Gu Teng up and said, “Why are you kneeling down? Senior Brother Gu is here today, so don’t do something so embarrassing now.”

Gu Teng immediately rejoiced as he looked at Gu Feng, “Big Brother, are you going to help me?”

Gu Feng glared at his younger brother, which made Gu Teng terrified. Right at this moment, the blue-clothed youth smiled with disdain, “Why does Senior Brother Gu have to act personally? Don’t worry about it. I’ll get him to kneel before you and humiliate him the same way you were humiliated back then.”

Gu Teng immediately rejoiced and cupped his hands together, “Thank you, Senior Brother Kong.”

He knew that Lin Yun was doomed. He could finally vent out the humiliation he suffered. Right at this moment, a grey-clothed figure descended from the sky. He was also donned in the core disciple uniform. He looked at Gu Feng and said, “Senior Brother Gu, I just found out that he’s in the Infernal Realm.”

“Infernal Realm?” Everyone was shocked. How did Lin Yun enter the Infernal Realm?

“Good. If he’s in the Infernal Realm, then I can cripple him and easily cover it up,” smiled Gu Feng sinisterly. The Infernal Realm was a double-edged sword. In Gu Feng’s view, that place was suitable for him to act.

As for Lin Yun, he naturally had no idea what was coming. He soared into the sky towards the fourth layer under everyone’s attention. “It’s him again!”

“He’s insane. The three hundred meters didn’t kill him, so he’s going to the fourth layer?”

“I’m afraid that he won’t even be able to break the barrier to get to the fourth layer.” Many people smiled because the barrier wasn’t easy to break. If Lin Yun was careless, he might even be knocked down by it.

While everyone waited for Lin Yun to embarrass himself, a sword ray lit up the horizon. Before anyone could imprint Lin Yun’s shining face, the third layer was broken and Lin Yun charged forward without any hesitation.

“He really went in!” Everyone was shocked. After all, the fourth layer was considered forbidden. Many people had failed over the past few decades and it had been a long time since anyone dared to give it a try. Lin Yun was only in the lesser Yin stage, yet he had actually reached the fourth layer. His prospects made everyone excited.

When Lin Yun appeared on the fourth layer, he was instantly trapped in a cage. He didn’t even have time to look around. The cage was made of flames and Lin Yun could sense the cage shrinking, albeit very slowly. Sensing the urgency of the situation, Lin Yun sat down and circulated the Iris Sword Sutra, “I don’t have much time.”

When Lin Yun circulated the Iris Sword Sutra, the cage began to tremble as fine flames shot at him like fine needles. The pain was several times worse than the third layer. At the same time, the fire spiritual energy pouring into his body was also a lot stronger.

“Looks like I came to the right place.” Lin Yun was satisfied with this place. After all, danger also represented opportunity. He then focused on refining the ancient fire spiritual energy, controlling the silver Iris Flower to devour all the surrounding spiritual energy.

As time slowly passed, the Iris Flower released a chilling fluctuation. It was a strange feeling when the ancient and mysterious chill leaked out. At the same time, the Iris Sword Sutra seemed to be undergoing a bizarre transformation.

The Iris Sword Sutra came from the Iris Sword Saint and had a total of sixteen stages. So it far exceeded ordinary cultivation techniques. But Lin Yun didn’t feel that it was that different aside from the fact that it made his origin energy more powerful.

Could it be that the Iris Sword Sutra was finally going to reveal its true prowess today? Just thinking about it made Lin Yun’s heart beat wildly because he knew that he made the right decision to come to the fourth layer.

Two hours wasn’t long, but it also wasn’t short. As the Iris Sword Sutra slowly became stronger, the cage around slowly shrank. Soon, the cage was like shackles on Lin Yun’s body. The cage would continue to shrink and once it reached its limit,it would cause Lin Yun’s body to explode.

Lin Yun’s heart was lifted. The Iris Flower was just one petal away from reaching the pinnacle. If he couldn’t make it in time, he couldn’t imagine the dire consequences. However, just when the cage was about to enter his body, Lin Yun’s violet palace suddenly glowed and a sword array was formed. At the same time, an ancient voice sounded out by Lin Yun’s ears, “Iris Sword Array—Absolute Unrivaled; Primal Origin, Praise the Phoenix!”

All the disciples outside the Infernal Realm suddenly felt a chill down their spine. When they opened their eyes, they saw four people that caused their faces to change. There were actually three core disciples that were being led by the infamous Gu Feng.

When they recalled Lin Yun’s appearance here, they instantly figured out what was going on. So Gu Feng was here for Lin Yun.

“Get lost!” The blue-clothed youth frowned his brows and he kicked several inner disciples who were in his way away, scaring everyone into opening a path for them. It didn’t take long for the four to reach the Infernal Realm’s entrance. Many inner disciples who were previously jealous of Lin Yun instantly wore a playful expression.

“What are you guys trying to do…” Gong Ming, who was standing guard, had a horrified expression when he saw Gu Feng. But before he could even finish, he was sent flying with a slap from Kong Xuan.

“A mere deacon dares to speak to us? Are you courting death?!” barked the blue-clothed youth.

Gong Ming had a trace of blood leaking down from his lips, but he didn’t dare to utter a word. Gu Feng couldn’t be bothered with Gong Ming as he looked at the Infernal Realm’s entrance.

“Big Brother, this fellow is with Lin Yun!” said Gu Teng coldly. His words made Gong Ming’s face change.

“I can’t be bothered with this piece of trash. Let’s look for Lin Yun first and let him know the consequences of messing with me!” said Gu Feng with disdain.

“You guys aren’t allowed to pass here!” Gong Ming suddenly stood before them. He knew it would be trouble if he allowed them in. He could imagine them disrupting Lin Yun’s cultivation. Lin Yun trusted him and let him stand guard here, so he couldn’t allow Gu Feng in.

“You’re courageous, but what a pity…” sneered Gu Feng.

Before Gu Feng made a move, Kong Xuan laughed and reached out to Gong Ming, “Someone like you is just a piece of trash in our eyes!”

Gong Ming’s bones suddenly started to break from Kong Xuan’s grab. Kong Xuan laughed at this and gave him an arrogant command, “Kneel!”

Gong Ming threw up a mouthful of blood as he gnashed his teeth. The difference between them was too great, causing his knees to touch the ground. Kong Xuan’s speed was shocking and truly showcased the strength of a core disciple. The difference between a lesser and greater Yin stage was huge.

Right at this moment, the platform suddenly trembled and a blurred image appeared before the entrance. They could all see a cage shattering. This made the faces of Gu Feng and Kong Xuan change as someone broke the Infernal Cage.

“The Infernal Cage actually broke?” Gu Feng muttered to himself.

Kong Xuan had loathsome eyes as he looked at Gong Ming, “If it wasn’t for this piece of trash blocking our way, we might be able to snatch some of the fragments. They’re a great source of nourishment.”

Kong Xuan reached out and to give Gong Ming another slap, but right at this moment, a figure slowly came out of the flame, “Stop!”

It was Lin Yun.

When Gong Ming saw Lin Yun, he yelled, “Brother Lin, run! They’re here for you!”

There were no changes on Lin Yun’s face, but when he looked at Gong Ming’s swollen cheeks, his eyes flashed coldly.

“Flower Burial? You’re right on time…” Kong Xuan’s eyes lit up and he looked at Lin Yun, “Since you’re here, then you might as well kneel!”

Kong Xuan soared into the sky and slapped Lin Yun with excitement as his aura boiled in his body. However, there were no changes to Lin Yun’s face as he threw out a punch. Facing Kong Xuan’s palm, he didn’t even move his feet, which shocked Kong Xuan. He could sense his palm sinking into an ocean, not causing a single ripple.

“Is this the arm you used previously?” asked Lin Yun.

“So what? Are you possibly going to get revenge?” Kong Xuan gnashed his teeth as he pondered how to injure Lin Yun heavily.

“Then I’ll take this arm,” said Lin Yun coldly. The Iris Flower in his dantian bloomed and Lin Yun grabbed onto Kong Xuan’s wrist before giving it a pull.

This made Kong Xuan yell out in pain as his entire arm was pulled out of its socket. But Lin Yun didn’t stop there. He slammed his palm on Kong Xuan’s chest, breaking Kong Xuan’s ribs and injuring his internal organs. The impact of the palm sent Kong Xuan flying.

This scene shocked everyone as they looked at Lin Yun dumbfoundedly. They didn’t expect Lin Yun to handle Kong Xuan so easily. Furthermore, they couldn’t even catch Kong Xuan’s shadows. Kong Xuan had simply disappeared before them.

This instantly made the entire plaza fall into silence. Even the other core disciple standing beside Gu Teng had fear in his eyes as he took a few steps back. Only Gu Feng wore a sinister smile as if Kong Xuan’s life and death had nothing to do with him.

Gu Feng looked at Lin Yun and said, “You do have some strength. No wonder you dare to be so arrogant. You must have gotten quite a bit of the fragments earlier, right? Hand them over and I’ll let you off.”

“Fragments? I don’t have any of them. But I do have an Infernal Flower. But do you even have the qualification to take it from me?” Lin Yun sneered as he took out the Infernal Flower. The sky instantly turned dark as the only source of light came from the flower.

When everyone saw the flower, their faces changed. It was too unbelievable that Lin Yun had the Infernal Flower. Didn’t this mean that Lin Yun was the one who broke the cage? Just thinking about it made everyone exclaim with shock.
