Chapter 1304 - Transcendent Geniuses? (2)

Next up would be the main event, the Dragon Saint Pellet and the Quasi-Saint Origin. There was no way he could deal with the Quasi-Saint Origin anytime soon, and he had to reach the Elysium Core Realm before he could try and refine it.

“Wait up.” Lil’ Purple stopped Lin Yun just when he was about to retrieve the Dragon Saint Pellet. She was seated on the Snow Heed Blade and began to flick her fingers around, laying down a spiritual rune array in the surroundings.

Occasionally, a light would flicker as though she was painting. But in Lin Yun’s eyes, she was being a little too cautious. After all, this location was already remote enough, and even if there were any accidents, he could easily set up a restriction in the surroundings with his sword intent.

Half a day later, Lil’ Purple was done. She nodded her head and said, “Alright. You can get started now.”

When Lin Yun uncovered the jade bottle, a draconic roar resounded and a violent gale appeared, forcing Lin Yun to close his eyes with his hair fluttering violently from the wind. Shortly after, a dragon flew out from the jade bottle.

When the dragon flew out, it immediately soared into the sky and wanted to escape. But it clashed with the spiritual array that Lil’ Purple had set up. When the dragon collided with the spiritual array, it began to crumble like sand. Every single speck of dust was glowing with light and a dense herbal fragrance before it rained down like a waterfall.

When it fell down, it manifested into a dragon once more, manifesting into a gigantic dragon’s head that sat at the summit of the mountain.

When the dragon looked at Lin Yun and Lil’ Purple, one could see the pride and ferocity in its pupils. Then, it unleashed a roar at the two of them. Clearly, it wasn’t happy that it was being restrained here.

But just when it opened its mouth and before it could unleash a full roar, Lil’ Purple raised her head with the golden and crimson mark on her forehead blooming with a bright radiance. In the next second, cracks began to envelop the dragon’s body.

From within the cracks, a seven-colored light broke out and the dense herbal fragrance and dragon blood essence reached every corner of this place.

This scene made Lin Yun’s heart beat wildly because he could feel the excitement of the Azure Dragon Saint Art. He could feel his blood boiling with an irresistible thirst for this ‘saint dragon’ before his eyes.

In just this brief moment, Lin Yun could feel a warm current flowing throughout his body, and his cultivation that had halted a long time ago actually began to improve. Simultaneously, the boundless astral energy within his body also became even more refined and simply left him marveled.

But Lin Yun suppressed the agitating Azure Dragon Saint Art within his body and reached out. Then, one purple-golden dragon rune after another flew from his fingertips. As the purple-golden dragon runes flew out, Lin Yun could sense that they had brought quite a bit of his vitality out at the same time.

When the thousand purple-golden dragon runes flew out, they manifested into an azure dragon that was roughly ten feet long, enveloping a thunderstorm when it appeared.

“So I’m also someone with a dragon…” Lin Yun couldn’t help smiling when he saw this scene.

Although this dragon wasn’t genuine, it had flesh and blood. Not to mention that it even possessed a dragon aura. However, that flesh and blood came from Lin Yun and the saint elixir, the Dragon Blood Fruit. Although the dragon aura came from the Azure Dragon Saint Art, it still couldn’t be compared to a genuine azure dragon.

When the azure dragon appeared, its eyes were glowing brightly, and began to devour the ‘saint dragon’ before it. Just like that, the mighty ‘saint dragon’ was being gobbled up like an elixir. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

As the azure dragon devoured the ‘saint dragon’, the azure dragon began to expand in size. As the dragon scales emitted a dazzling light, it made the azure dragon look sacred. When the azure dragon was more or less done, the amount of essence remaining in the Dragon Saint Pellet was the size of a fist.

“Is this the genuine Dragon Saint Pellet?” Lin Yun could feel that his heart was on the verge of jumping out when he looked at the essence because this was simply too tempting.

“Devour this saint pellet, and your azure dragon should be able to produce a dragon pearl. But you still have to find a true bone in the future. Otherwise, your Azure Dragon Saint Art will be lacking, no matter what…” The mark on Lil’ Purple’s forehead shone as she turned her head to look at Lin Yun.

“It’s too hard to search for a true bone comparable to the Azure Dragon King's true bone,” sighed Lin Yun. The Azure Dragon Lord had given him an Azure Dragon True Bone, and it was the core true bone of an Azure Dragon King, containing a complete divine rune.

Rather than calling it an Azure Dragon True Bone, it was something as rare and comparable to some divine dragon bones.

After the azure dragon devoured the Dragon Saint Pellet, the dragon began to wriggle in mid-air and was enveloped in lightning. At the same time, a powerful suction force drew the herbal fragrance over. A brief moment later, it had formed into a purple-golden dragon cocoon of nearly three meters.

Standing at the summit of the mountain, Lin Yun looked at the cocoon. The dragon cocoon had traces of blood threads on it. He reach out with his eyes blazing, “That’s the Blood Flame Divine Rune, right? How is it compared to the divine rune of the Azure Dragon True Bone?”

Relying on a breath of divine flames from Lil’ Purple, the Blood Flame Dragon Rune got upgraded from a saint rune to a genuine divine rune. The Blood Flame Divine Rune was extremely powerful. When ignited, it could enable his physique to be comparable to a thousand-rune saint armor, and it could allow Lin Yun to confront Elysium Core Realm experts once he was at the Empyrean Realm.

“It’s not an origin divine rune, so there’s no way it can be comparable to a naturally born divine rune. In the golden era, divine spiritualists could create one with their own power,” said Lil’ Purple with a calm expression.

But when Lin Yun heard that, the corner of his lips couldn’t help twitching. When he looked at her, she had a golden and a crimson mark on her forehead that intertwined together, allowing her to emit a sacred and holy temperament.

Those two were origin divine runes, one from the Azure Dragon True Bone, and the other came from herself as a member of the Divine Phoenix Clan. So the precious Blood Flame Divine Rune was naturally nothing in her eyes.

As Lil’ Purple hovered over Lin Yun while seated on the Snow Heed Blade, she said, “It’s time for you to manifest your constellation.”

Her words made Lin Yun’s blood instantly boil. He had been waiting for this day for a long time. He was feeling both nervous and excited at the same time.

Clenching his right fist, Lin Yun could feel his blood surging within his body and he felt as though he had grasped onto the entire world at this moment. There were flames blazing in his pupils, unleashing an unprecedented light.

Transcendent geniuses? At this moment, he felt that he could face anyone, even if they were the strongest batch of transcendent geniuses.
