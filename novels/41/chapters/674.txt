Chapter 675 - Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture

In a pavilion located at the edge of the spiritual lake, Lin Yun and Luo Yu were drinking. A brief moment later, Lin Yun found out that this place was called the Falling Aquatic Residence. This courtyard with a spiritual lake belonged to the Falling Aquatic Residence. Even the tall spiritual mountain belonged to the same person.

The Falling Aquatic Residence’s owner didn’t just have a transcendent position in the Skymound City, but also in the entire Thunder Prefecture. Even the Indigomoon Elysium was fearful of the owner. The owner had a mysterious origin, which produced many rumors. However, no one knew which rumors were real and which rumors were fake.

So even if the geniuses in the Skymound City had been warned by their elders not to provoke the Falling Aquatic Residence. Lin Yun only understood why no one dared to touch him in the courtyard after Luo Yu’s explanation.

“Can it be that you’re the Falling Aquatic Residence’s owner?” Lin Yun asked as he took a sip of wine.

“I’m only an employee here. I’ve only seen that lord several times, but he stays there.” Luo Yu smiled and pointed towards a direction in the distance.

Lin Yun followed the direction and saw a colossal mountain that emitted a boundless pressure, making this place look like a paradise. Luo Yu was pointing at Skymound Mountain, the foundation of the Skymound City’s spiritual energy.

It was said that many years ago, before the Sword Sect was destroyed, this was one of Sword Sect’s seven spiritual mountains. So Lin Yun thought that it had been occupied by the Skycloud Sect. After all, it was the biggest sect in the Skymound City.

But he never imagined that the entire mountain was actually occupied by one person. Thinking about it again, this person was rather mysterious because he had never heard of this person in the past.

Placing the cup down, Luo Yu smiled, “I’m here to sincerely apologize.”

“Apologize? What did you do wrong?” Lin Yun looked at Luo Yu with a playful smile. After all, according to the auction rules, no one should have been able to make a move against Lin Yun without paying spiritual jades. In fact, Luo Yu was totally capable of stopping them.

But Luo Yu had chosen to ignore it and only stepped out after Skymound City’s geniuses made their moves, taking the chance to earn a huge sum of money from the various forces.

Luo Yu squinted his eyes as Lin Yun had seen through his scheme completely. He knew that Lin Yun was unhappy with him. A long time later, he smiled, “How about this, we’ll speak openly. I was indeed in the wrong, but I hope that you can be understanding. Now that you’re in trouble, I might be able to help you. As for the reason, I bet you can guess why. The Draconic Banquet will start in six months. You might be weaker than the seven geniuses in Skymound City now, but who knows what will happen in six months?”

He wasn’t lying because he had completely changed his mind about Lin Yun during the auction. He was especially impressed with how Lin Yun was able to take out so many fourth grade spiritual jades all the while being comparable to Xiang Tianhe. Furthermore, Lin Yun was only eighteen this year.

No one would help you for no reason, so Lin Yun could barely believe Luo Yu.

Examining Lin Yun, Luo Yu smiled, “Hehe, those fellows outside might not have alarmed their elders, but it still won’t be easy for you to leave. But with my help, at least you can come and go in Skymound City without any obstruction. Furthermore, I don’t need anything from you. I just wish to befriend you. Consider this my apology for what happened back in the auction.”

“I wish to know if there’s any demonic beast with dragon bloodline near the Skymound City,” said Lin Yun.

“Demonic beasts with dragon bloodline?” Luo Yu looked at Lin Yun in surprise. But after a brief second, he smiled, “Sure, give me one moment.”

Luo Yu took out a white jade slip and closed his eyes as if he was transmitting some information. Lin Yun realized that there was a faint light coming from the jade slip, along with a ripple that vibrated with a peculiar fluctuation.

“Alright,” said Luo Yu.

Just when Lin Yun was feeling baffled, a skinny hawk flew past fifteen minutes later and a parchment fell onto the table. When Luo Yu carefully opened it, Lin Yun noticed that it was a map with several black dots.

“This is…” Lin Yun was surprised.

“This is the Skymound City’s territory. Demonic beasts with dragon bloodline have been marked here. There are still other traces of demonic beasts with dragon bloodline, but we’re not able to confirm their location. As for the marked ones on the map, they’re confirmed,” smiled Luo Yu.

“Mistcloud Mountain Range, Dragon Blooded Demonhawk. An overlord demonic beast in the lesser Yin-Yang stage.”

“Dragonflame Cave, Dragonrock Tiger. An overlord demonic beast in the greater Yin-Yang stage.”

“Shatterrock Peak, Goldbone Dragonwolf. An overlord demonic beast in the greater Yin-Yang stage.”

“...”

Lin Yun examined the map with admiration on his face. He had to admit that Luo Yu was truly capable since he gathered this information so quickly. If he had to search for it by himself, it could have taken forever. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“You must be shocked. We’re professionals, so many geniuses in Skymound City cooperate with us. After all, the intelligence from their forces isn’t enough,” smiled Luo Yu.

Hearing those words made Lin Yun even more curious of the Falling Aquatic Residence’s owner. If an employee already had this much capability, how powerful was the owner? But he pushed that question to the back of his mind since this map solved his current dilemma.

“Wait…” Lin Yun’s face suddenly changed and asked, “There are even Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beasts?”

There were two skulls marked on the map.

“Blackwater Pond, Bloodflame Demonic Dragonpython. A Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beast in adulthood.”

“Dragonflame Hill, Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture. A Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beast in adulthood.”

Lin Yun’s heart trembled when he read the information. Those sort of existences weren’t ones he could provoke. He knew that those demonic beasts had a huge origin just by their names, especially since they were marked to be in adulthood.

Lil’ Red might seem powerful, but it was still in infancy. In fact, it had only just started growing. But if he could really refine the blood essence of these two demonic beasts, he was confident that it would bring his Azure Dragon Enneaform to the fourth stage. At that time, even the seven elites of Skymound City that Luo Yu spoke of wouldn’t be able to suppress him.

“I guess that you’re intending on refining these demonic beasts’ blood essence. But refining their blood essence isn’t the same as refining beast cores. The bloodline of these demonic beasts aren’t pure, so the more powerful they are, the more terrifying their will is,” said Luo Yu. “If you’re careless, it might change your character greatly and you might even become a fool… It’s dangerous, so I suggest that you don’t do it.”

“An adult Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beast is extremely powerful. Even if it allows you to attack as you like, you might not be able to kill it. On the contrary, all it needs is to stare at you to take your life,” said Luo Yu with a grave expression.

This… Lin Yun had shock flashing in his pupils. He knew that what Luo Yu said wasn’t false, especially when these Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beasts possessed the dragon bloodline.

“But it doesn’t mean there isn’t a chance,” smiled Luo Yu mysteriously.

There’s a way?! Lin Yun’s heart jolted violently when he heard Luo Yu’s words. But was it really possible? After all, not even a powerful sect like the Skycloud Sect would dare to provoke a Heavenly Soul Realm demonic beast.

After all, a Heavenly Soul Realm human cultivator could gain a position in the Ancient Southern Domain, not to mention an overlord demonic beast that possesses dragon bloodline.

“Are you sure?” Although Luo Yu had the mysterious owner backing him up, Lin Yun calmed down as he looked at Luo Yu with doubt. After all, it was practically impossible unless Luo Yu came with him…

As if seeing through Lin Yun’s thoughts, Luo Yu smiled, “Although I’m optimistic about you, I won’t put my life at risk. Furthermore, I’m a walking target myself and I will attract its attention. It’s safer for you to do it yourself, not to mention you only need its blood essence and aren’t really killing it.”

Then, Luo Yu told Lin Yun his method. When Lin Yun heard what Luo Yu had to say, his face changed a little as there really was a chance. But it would still be dangerous and he would be dead if the demonic beast came after him.

“You can decide for yourself. But I don’t recommend that you take the risk. It’s safer for you to kill the Dragonrock Tiger or Dragon Blooded Demonhawk with your strength,” said Luo Yu sincerely.

“I have two plans now. I’ll decide after observing the situation. If it’s really impossible, I won’t put my life at risk.”

“No problem, I’ll go make preparations.”

In the next few days, Lin Yun stayed in the Falling Aquatic Residence. Aside from cultivating, he spent most of his time making preparations. Additionally, he also got a better understanding of the Thunder Prefecture from Luo Yu.

The Thunder Prefecture was a territory of the Sword Sect and it was a huge territory. The Thunder Prefecture was built on the ruins of the Sword Sect and secret realms with legacies would occasionally appear.

This alone was enough to attract the attention of the entire Ancient Southern Domain’s geniuses. Every time a secret realm appeared, demonic aura would leak into the prefecture a little. This was why the demonic beasts in the Thunder Prefecture were more or less mutated.

The leaking could even cause beat tides in serious cases. Although it was dangerous, it was also a perfect tempering experience for the geniuses gathered here. Furthermore, they could also receive opportunities from those secret realms. This was why the geniuses from the Thunder Prefecture were a lot stronger than the others.

While Lin Yun was making parations, news about him began to spread even more wildly in Skymound City. It was especially crazy since many people witnessed how Lin Yun destroyed the Chen Clan’s Profound Note Bell. They even heard that the Chen Clan’s elders were furious.

Three days later, Luo Yu reappeared with a thick letter with ‘Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture’ written on it.

Lin Yun had chosen to go after the Indigo Thunderdemon Dragonvulture and this letter contained all the information regarding Dragonflame Hill and the demonic beast itself.
