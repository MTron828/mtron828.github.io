Chapter 2024 - Ask My Sword!

When the sacred flames ignited, Qu Duan activated the Black Lotus Saint Physique with his shirt ripping apart, revealing the black runes on his body. He was also giving off an ancient and powerful aura.

Seeing this, Jin Xuanyi raised his brow and muttered, “It’s actually the Black Lotus Saint Physique.”

Regardless of natal saint physiques or acquired saint physiques, they were divided into different levels. Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon Saint Physique would improve along with his Azure Dragon Saint Art, which was the same as his Blue Dragon Saint Physique.

Bai Qingyu’s Natal Yin Saint Physique wasn’t awakened. Even if it had awakened, she would have barely achieved lesser mastery.

The Black Lotus Saint Physique was unique because it would be impressive if one could barely reach lesser mastery before the Quasi-Saint Realm. Qu Duan was impressive since he could reach greater mastery before entering the Quasi-Saint Realm.RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

The holy lands’ geniuses were surprised. They knew why Qu Duan had the confidence to challenge Jin Xuanyi before them.

Qu Duan hovered in the air, then stepped on a Black Lotus, and smiled, “You’re a lot stronger than two years ago. You would have been able to maintain first on the King Ranking if you didn’t run into me, but what a pity…”

“A pity what?” Jin Xuanyi shook his head and smiled, “You think you're invincible with the Black Lotus Saint Physique? Qu Duan, you’re too ignorant.”

Jin Xuanyi’s gaze became cold, with a mysterious mark blooming on his forehead and giving off an ancient aura. The next moment, lightning bolts flew out from his body, forming into lightning pythons. The nine lightning pythons looked like they were alive, and he even released a terrifying aura, not to mention the lightning pythons even had a horn on their heads.

They might be lightning pythons, but they were more like lightning lesser dragons. When Jin Xuanyi began forming seals with his hands, the lightning lesser dragons dashed forth.

“Hmph!” Qu Duan snorted. The Black Lotus Sacred Flame gathered in his palm, forming a fist that flew forth. With just one punch, cracks began to appear on the lightning lesser dragons.

The power of the Black Lotus Saint Physique was terrifying, and the nine lightning lesser dragons were knocked flying away when Qu Duan charged forth. With a few flickers, he appeared before Jin Xuanyi. Undoubtedly, it wouldn’t feel great if Jin Xuanyi took the punch head-on. There might even be a possibility that he would die on the spot.

Jin Xuanyi calmly took a step back, causing Qu Duan’s attack to miss. But cracking sounds still echoed because space was shattered by Qu Duan’s Black Lotus Saint Physique.

After stepping back, Jin Xuanyi took this opportunity to point his finger at Qu Duan’s chest. This instantly made Qu Duan’s face change because he didn’t dare take this finger head-on, even with the Black Lotus Saint Physique.

Qu Duan quickly dodged the finger and clashed with Jin Xuanyi once more. Their fight was ferocious, and one side would be heavily injured if they weren’t careful.

“Heavenly Incineration Sacred Flame!” Qu Duan became furious, seeing that he couldn’t injure Jin Xuanyi. His palms faced the sky like he was lifting the sky with his hands.

A huge crack appeared in the sky as black lotuses appeared, with sacred flames blazing at the heart of the lotuses. Countless black flames began to rain down, wanting to envelop Jin Xuanyi.

But Jin Xuanyi merely smiled and waved his hands, unleashing lightning bolts from his fingers. The lightning bolt compressed into a light beam with runes engraved on it, clearing a path under the sacred flames.

“Black Lotus Sacred Hand!” Qu Duan roared, and a black lotus descended from the sky. The magma on the ground formed into a demonic palm that flew over towards Jin Xuanyi.

“Great timing!” Jin Xuanyi laughed. He spread his arms apart and flew backwards before his hands joined together. The lightning lesser dragons formed a pagoda and enveloped him within it. When he took Qu Duan’s attack head-on, cracks began to spread out on the pagoda, with black fragments falling.

“Damn it!” Qu Duan locked his brows together. As he clenched his fists, cracking sounds echoed from his body as the black runes began to shine. He wanted to fight Jin Xuanyi, but the latter avoided a head-on fight.

All the spectators became nervous as they watched the battle. Amongst the Heavenly Dao Sect’s faction, Nangong Fuye said, “Jin Xuanyi is really terrifying. Not only does he have a terrifying attainment in lightning, but there aren’t any flaws in his speed and physique. Even Qu Duan’s Black Lotus Saint Physique can’t obtain any advantage, and Jin Xuanyi probably still has trump cards left.”

Nangong Fuye couldn’t help taking a peek at Profound Maiden Xan Yin in concern. This was because if Jin Xuanyi won and challenged the Heavenly Dao Sect, she would have no choice but to accept the challenge.

“Haha, let’s stop it here.” Jin Xuanyi suddenly laughed. He was done probing Qu Duan’s strength. As the lightning lesser dragons crumbled, they gathered and were forcibly mended together by an ancient aura. That aura came from Jin Xuanyi’s forehead. When the full power was unleashed, everyone could sense a pressure crushing down on them.

“Black Lotus Saint Bone!” Qu Duan also felt the pressure, but he pushed his palms forth. The black lotuses coiled around his body and formed into a ten-foot bone frame. The bone frame was enveloped in black flames like an ancient giant, wielding a whip on the left and a sword on the right.

At the same time, Jin Xuanyi was also done. The black fragments formed into an ancient beast that was enveloped in lightning and flames. Before everyone could look at the beast, the two powers clashed together.

Qu Duan threw out a mouthful of blood and was sent flying away as the bone frame shattered. His face was pale as he fell to the ground. He stared at Jin Xuanyi, “This is impossible! How can the celestial body formed by Black Lotus Saint Bone possibly be broken by someone beneath the Quasi-Saint Realm?!”

The black fragments returned to Jin Xuanyi’s body as the mark disappeared from his forehead. He said, “I bet you didn’t see it clearly earlier. The beast earlier was a Lightning Qilin. You would be dead by now if you didn’t have the Black Lotus Saint Physique.”

“Lightning Qilin!” Everyone, including the six holy lands’ geniuses, was shocked. Qilins were primordial divine beasts. So did that mean Jin Xuanyi had obtained the Lightning Qilin’s inheritance? What kind of luck was that? They now knew why he was ranked first on the King Ranking. Glory might be invisible, but Jin Xuanyi’s glory was too great.

“Get lost.” Jin Xuanyi threw Qu Duan out of the arena with a wave. He raised his head and smiled, “Now that the clown is gone, it’s time for me to move on to the main dish. Which one of the six holy lands wants to come first?”

Qu Duan threw out a mouthful of blood upon hearing that he was called a clown. He went into seclusion for two years and became Jin Xuanyi’s stepping stone.

The faces of everyone from the six holy lands changed, but no one said anything about it.

Jin Xuanyi smiled, “Since no one is willing to come forth, why don’t I take a pick? Anyhow, it doesn’t matter who comes first or last.”

He swept his gaze at the Heavenly Dao Sect’s party and fixated it on Xin Yan. He smiled, “Profound Holy Maiden, since you wanted to fight me back in the treehouse inn, why don’t I start with you? Of course, you can also admit defeat.”

Xin Yan calmly replied, “I underestimated you at the treehouse inn, and I’m probably not your enemy. But I’ll give you a fight since you want a fight. Saint’s disciples from the Heavenly Dao Sect can lose, but we won’t admit defeat before a fight.”

Her response made many people look at her in a new light and acknowledged that she was the Serene Dust Great Saint’s disciple.

Jin Xuanyi squinted his pupils and smiled, “The Serene Dust Great Saint can’t say anything even if you die in the arena. So you have to think it through.”

“Jin Xuanyi, why don’t you try and touch her?” A cold voice echoed. It was Lin Yun who arrived in time. Aside from the sweat on his forehead, since he was donned a white robe, he looked elegant. He immediately rushed over after he was done in the Myriad Graves Valley without a rest. This was why he looked a little exhausted.

But Lin Yun’s backbone was straight as he said, “If you want to bully her, you’ll have to ask my sword!”
