Chapter 1122 - Each With Their Own Schemes

Lin Yun’s words made Lil’ Purple feel a chill run down her spine as she saw the demon who slaughtered his way through the gold ranking of the Heavenly Path. After all, Lin Yun’s journey in the Heavenly Path was forged by bones.

Ever since he slaughtered his way through the servants of the Realm Sons in the Yellow Sandy Plain, everyone thought he was a demon. In fact, that was the moment where his title as Flower Burial began to spread.

But after arriving in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, Lin Yun had calmed down a lot even after killing the demonic cultivators, so much so that he wouldn’t even bother to deal with those who didn’t provoke him unless they were on the list.

But today, Lin Yun didn’t hold back his rage and killing aura. With all of his experiences, his killing aura was a lot more terrifying than anyone had imagined. The three sects probably had no idea what kind of existence they offended.

“Lin Yun, they’re all in the pinnacle Galaxy Stage. Even if you can wield the flute as a sword, it’s still too impulsive,” persuaded Lil’ purple. She didn’t want to see Lin Yun die. If it was just Yan Teng, Lin Yun could easily defeat him with his other identity as Flower Burial. But it didn’t seem possible to her for Lin Yun to face all three of them.

“Do I look like an impulsive person?” Lin Yun asked.

“No,” replied Lil’ Purple.

Rubbing Lil’ Purple on her head, Lin Yun replied, “If I was impulsive, Yan Teng would be a dead man right now. However, I don’t want to reveal my trump cards and identity. If I did, Thunderclap Sword Demon might not show up… Furthermore, Yan Teng’s death would bring trouble to the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect…”

Only then did Lil’ Purple realize that she overreacted. She could tell that Lin Yun wanted to kill the disciples of the three major sects and Thunderclap Sword Demon.

“So this is why you took three palms from them?” Lil’ Purple asked.

“Well, I can’t possibly watch Lil’ Red die, right?” Lin Yun’s gaze became gentle when he looked at Lil’ Red in Lil’ Purple’s embrace, but the depth of his pupils was boiling with a killing aura. Not only did Yan Teng go against his words, but he even shattered all of Lil’ Red’s bones with a palm. He was fortunate that Lil’ Red had a unique bloodline and also cultivated the Ancient Dracoape Art. After all, Lil’ Red was fine after taking several droplets of True Dragon Saint Liquid.

“What’s your current level with the flute?” Lil’ Purple asked.

Lin Yun usually cultivated alone, and Lil’ Purple wasn’t around when he conversed with Luo Hua. Plus, Lin Yun didn’t reveal his full strength over the past month. She was curious why Lin Yun was so confident.

She knew that Lin Yun had a terrifying talent when it came to music, not to mention that he also had the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute which was comparable to a divine artifact. So he naturally made swift progress over the past two months.

Looking at the stars in the sky, Lin Yun replied, “You’ll know after two days.”

“Hmph!” Lil’ Purple snorted, unhappy that Lin Yun wasn’t going to tell her.

But Lin Yun merely smiled before he took out a Nirvana Pellet to heal his injuries. Although the sword box negated most of the damage from Yan Teng’s group, he was still heavily injured due to his cultivation. But with the Nirvana Pellet, he would be able to recover regardless of how heavy his injuries were.

Although his injuries weren’t so serious that he needed the Nirvana Pellet, he still decided to use it because he knew that there would be an intense battle two days from now. The Nirvana Pellet could not only heal his injuries completely, but it could also boost his cultivation.

When night came, Yan Teng, Lan Lei, and Xuan Fei discussed how they should deal with Thunderclap Sword Demon in two days. After all, Thunderclap Sword Demon had an infamous reputation and would leave a note every time he made his move. But even so, he wasn’t caught or killed despite the preparation of various sects. So none of them dared to underestimate Thunderclap Sword Demon.

“Brother Yan, it won’t be easy to deal with the Thunderclap Sword Demon. You said that you’re confident of winning, but I don’t dare to believe your words,” said Xuan Fei with his eyes flickering. Xuan Fei and Lei Lan were here because of Yan Teng, so they wanted to know why he was so confident.

Wearing a mysterious smile, Yan Teng smiled, “You’ll know about it sooner or later, so I can tell you my secret. My senior brother gave me a saint artifact before I came here!”

When Xuan Fei and Lei Lan heard that, their faces became grave. Saint artifacts were artifacts that transcended dao artifacts. Only a ninth-grade saint spiritualist could forge one. Saint spiritualists were divided into nine grades, and it wasn’t easy to make a breakthrough in each grade. To be a seventh-grade spiritualist, one needed to grasp 900 saint runes, which was a tough feat.

Unlike dao artifacts, saint artifacts had a saint rune engraved on them, and the core was a transcendent saint rune or an incomplete divine rune. The more saint runes that were engraved in a saint artifact, the stronger it would be. Some saint artifacts even had thousands of saint runes engraved on them.

In the Profound Azure Manor, even a saint artifact with 100 saint runes was precious. It wasn’t something that an empyrean could possess. It would be hard even for an Elysium Core Realm elder to possess a saint artifact, so the four major sects didn’t have many saint artifacts.

It was impossible for normal people to possess a saint artifact, but it was a different story for Yan Teng because his senior brother was Chu Tianhao, the chief disciple of the King Suspend Palace. His cultivation was in the Astral Stage and he was ranked within the top 20,000 on the Empyrean Ranking. He was also the strongest among the young generation.

In the entire Profound Azure Manor, not many people could compete with him. So it made sense that the King Suspend Palace gave him a saint artifact as Chu Tianhao was destined to walk out of the Profound Azure Manor.

“The Profound Azure Manor hasn’t been calm recently. First, Ye Ziling’s sky sword intent reached greater mastery, which means that her rank will rise. And now, we have Flower Burial who seems to be the core disciple of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect,” sneered Yan Teng. “The Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect’s fortune has shown signs of growing once again.”

When Xuan Fei and Lei Lan heard that, their hearts trembled because it seemed possible.

“But isn’t that too impulsive for us to come out with men just because of that?” Xuan Fei asked cautiously.

Yan Teng then smiled, “That’s because you have no idea of my senior brother’s two objectives. One is to kill Thunderclap Sword Demon before Ye Ziling returns to the Profound Azure Manor. He doesn’t want to give her a chance to kill Thunderclap Sword Demon.”

Lei Lan and Xuan Fei’s eyes flashed when they heard that and instantly understood the plan. Half a year ago, Thunderclap Sword Demon fled from Ye Ziling and slew several core disciples in the process. He had already become a knot in Ye Ziling’s heart, which was a huge blow to her. As long as she didn’t undo this knot, there would be a flaw in her sky sword intent.

“What’s the second objective then?” Lei Lan asked.

Yan Teng’s face turned cold and said, “Senior brother was pretty confident that Flower Burial will show up. If he does show up, we’ll kill him regardless if he’s a disciple from the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect.”

Hearing that, Lei Lan and Xuan Fei’s hearts sank because that was really a good scheme from Chu Tianhao. There were rumors that he was in seclusion trying to reach the highest stage in the King Suspend Art. But even if he was in seclusion, it felt as though everything was still in his grasp. Although their senior brothers weren’t weak, they were lacking compared to Chu Tianhao.

“Brother Yan, but weren’t you a little too impulsive back in the day?” Xuan Fei asked, mentioning what happened during the day. No matter how he looked at it, Yan Teng was a little impulsive to try and make a move against Lin Yun before Patriarch Qiu.

In the end, Yan Teng went back on his promise and even wanted to capture Lin Yun. Lin Yun was still a core disciple of the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, and the sword sect would definitely get revenge if anything happened to Lin Yun.

“I bet you guys know that someone has ascended the Sword Saint Mountain in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, right?” Yan Teng asked.

Both Xuan Fei and Lei Lan nodded their heads because this matter had sent a great shock in the Profound Azure Manor. The Sword Saint Mountain was famous in Ancient Barren Domain, and the three sects had their eye on it for a long time. But now, someone had ascended the peak and broke the millennium record, so how could they not know about it?

“He’s the one,” said Yan Teng, sending a great shock to Xuan Fei and Lei Lan. They couldn’t believe that the legend was forged by a person that they almost killed.

“If he isn’t crippled, he’ll become a great threat in the future. But it’s a pity that he fled.” Yan Teng touched the scar on his face with a sinister expression, “But the outcome isn’t bad. After all, we have yet to turn on the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, so there’s no need to cripple him publicly.”

“He must be heavily injured from our attacks, so he won’t leave Flow Light Island for three days,” said Xuan Fei with a cold light flashing through his pupils.

Yan Teng glanced at Xuan Fei and Lei Lan who were both smiling sinisterly. Clearly, the two of them shared the same thoughts.

“We’ll look for him after dealing with Thunderclap Sword Demon. We have to get rid of the threat no matter what,” said Yan Teng. Fate was rather miraculous, as Lin Yun and Yan Teng made plans against each other while waiting for the arrival of Thunderclap Sword Demon.
