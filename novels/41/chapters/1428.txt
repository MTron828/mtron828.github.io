Chapter 1429 - Utter Defeat (2)

“Damn it!” Xiahou Yan, Chen Bing, and Huang Yancheng’s faces were ugly, with their smiles frozen on their faces.

But Lin Yun naturally wouldn’t stop there. He leaned forth, dashing like a golden crow and clashing swords with Xiahou Yan. The collision made sparks fly around and forced Xiahou Yan to take two steps back. As Lin Yun flicked his wrist, he was divided into two, using a sword to block Chen Bing and Huang Yancheng’s attacks.

As a cold light flickered in his pupils, Lin Yun stomped his foot on the ground after he knocked the three of them back. Soaring into the sky, his boundless sword aura clashed against the three of them. This made Xiahou Yan, Chen Bing, and Huang Yancheng’s faces change because they could feel an immense pressure pressing down on them.

Endless Clouds!

Moon Courting!

Pricking Moon!

When Lin Yun attacked, he unleashed three powerful sword techniques against the three of them. His sword aura turned into a boundless lake with a moon hidden at the bottom of it. Lin Yun looked like a sword immortal at this moment as he moved around, giving everyone the illusion that he was dancing with his sword.

With a gentle smile, Lin Yun flicked his wrist, and the moon flew out from the bottom of the lake. As his boundless sword aura exploded, the moon collided with the three of them, sending them flying back with blood dripping from their lips.

“The Aquaheaven Sword Technique…” Jue Chen’s lips trembled as his eyes became watery. He was responsible for the second stage, so when he saw Lin Yun performing the Aquaheaven Sword Technique again, he still lost control of his emotions.

The six saints exchanged glances and could see the unconcealable shock in each other’s eyes. They instantly knew that Lin Yun was a true genius in the way of swords. They had witnessed how he comprehended this sword technique and how he summoned the holy spirit back then. But in just half a month, Lin Yun’s Aquaheaven Sword Technique had improved even further, giving them a feeling that it was about to break through the manifestation stage, which shocked them.

Rising Clouds!

Vast Aquasky!

Serene Aquasky!

Soaring White Clouds!

Lin Yun’s swordsmanship became faster and faster until his figure became blurred. He was facing three opponents at once, but Xiahou Yan’s group of three felt powerless before him as they struggled to fend off his attacks. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Descending Heavenly River!” When the various phenomena overlapped, Lin Yun thrust his sword out. All the phenomena combined and a figure appeared on the moon, performing the same sword technique. When Lin Yun overlapped with that figure, a boundless river covered in starlight gushed forth.

Before Lin Yun’s attack, Xiahou Yan, Chen Bing, and Huang Yancheng’s sword auras collapsed and they were sent flying away. The three were filled with wounds, covering them in their own blood. But they weren’t pushovers. They gritted their teeth with murderous intent surging in their pupils when they were sent flying back.

“Flaming Purgatory Slash!”

“God Star Destruction!”

“Great Sun Void Slash!”

They seized the opportunity after Lin Yun unleashed his attack to counterattack, using their strongest attacks. The surrounding audiences exclaimed in surprise and covered their mouths.

But Lin Yun didn’t panic. He stepped back while raising his sword in front of his chest. When he took the seventh step back, he realized he had no path of retreat as the three powerful attacks were about to envelop him.

Since there was no path of retreat, he would just open a path for himself. Raising his brow, twelve afterimages flew out from his body, and each afterimage performed a sword technique, performing the entire Aquaheaven Sword Technique in just one breath.

But that wasn’t all. Those twelve afterimages were divided into thirty-six afterimages, performing three different forms of the Aquaheaven Sword Technique. This filled the surroundings with various phenomena and sword rays as they intertwined. Thirty-six different intents and thirty-six different phenomena bloomed at the same time.

When all thirty-six afterimages overlapped, Lin Yun’s sword aura exploded with the light of a holy spirit shining brightly. Shortly after, a dragon roar echoed as a flawless Divine White Dragon flew from his body.

The corner of Lin Yun’s eye curved up to a smile. As the white dragon flew out, his long sleeves looked like the clouds and his azure clothes looked like an ocean.

The flames created by Huang Yancheng’s attack collapsed in a split second and a bloody hole appeared on his chest before he was sent flying back. The sword made of lightning also shattered into pieces while Chen Bing suffered a backlash; his face turned pale, and he threw out a mouthful of blood.

The bright sun from Xiahou Yan’s attack also dissipated, as if it was doused with water. This also made Xiahou Yan’s Innate Sword Physique dim.

Lin Yun elegantly landed on the ground as he looked at the three with the Flower Burial Sword in his hand. He was donned in an azure robe, carrying a sword box on his back, and an azure dragon was coiled around him. The purple mark on his forehead only made him look more ethereal and devilish.

At this moment, you could find all the beauty in the world on Lin Yun, which wasn’t an exaggeration.

“Summon your constellations!” Xiahou Yan slammed his palm onto the ground. Three paintings unfolded behind them when the three got back on their feet.

The summoning of a constellation was the strongest and last resort of any cultivator. But this also meant that they would be finished with no way of turning the table around if they failed.

But, they didn’t have any other choice but to resort to summoning their constellations. Their sword techniques, sword intents, and physiques had lost to Lin Yun. So they could only take the final gamble.

When the three constellations appeared and lit the mountain, their smiles soon froze on their faces before they could even rejoice. They saw three paintings flying out of Lin Yun. This made their jaws drop as disbelief filled their pupils.

“With a pair of eyes like the sun and moon, freezing all of eternity with one thought.” Their constellations dimmed when Lin Yun’s Aurora Dragon Painting opened up.

“Kunpeng rises with the wind like the sun, soaring straight to the nine heavens.” Fine cracks started to appear on their constellations when the Kunpeng Painting appeared.

“The phantom of the Flying Serpent bewitches all, disrupting both the circulation of stars and directions.” The Flying Serpent Painting dealt the last blow and Xiahou Yan, Chen Bing, and Huang Yancheng’s paintings crumbled. They could feel the primitive aura crashing down on them.

Although they did their best to resist, it was futile and they fell to their knees on the stage. None of their constellations were weak, but it was a pity that they ran into Lin Yun. Since the three were heavily injured, they could no longer pose any resistance after their constellations collapsed.

Lin Yun sheathed his sword and turned to the six saints, cupping his hands together, “Disciple Lin Yun, has accomplished his task. Those who humiliated the Sword Sect are now kneeling on the ground! I ask the saints to give out punishment as a warning to everyone!”
