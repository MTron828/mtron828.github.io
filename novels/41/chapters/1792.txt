Chapter 1793 - Blood Never Dries (1)

Mei Zihua’s words made everyone’s blood boil, and it felt as though they were seeing the rise of a great era. His zither melody was high, and it rang throughout Thunderblood Square.

No one was bothered in the beginning, but they were gradually affected by the zither. Their facial expressions became nervous, and their eyes were fixed on the Thunderblood Battlestage.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Ji Lingfeng, Xiao Yuanqi, and the Autumn Mountain Lord all ignored Mei Zihua. Their eyes were unhappily glued on Lin Yun.

Xiao Yuanqi cupped his hands together, “Let me experience the strength of the Nirvana Banquet’s champion, then.”

He had the strongest cultivation amongst the three, with his nine dragon pulses reaching five thousand feet. Not to mention he also grasped three different martial daos at the same time, which were all cultivated to the fifth grade.

Xiao Yuanqi circulated the Nine Heavenly Saint Cauldron and charged towards Lin Yun, pushing his palm forth. Before his palm reached, flaming clouds gathered within the sky with lightning flickering on his body. There were nine five thousand-foot wide dragon pulses behind him, emitting a horrifying aura along with three martial intents. This made his palm reach a terrifying height.

Everyone took in a cold breath. It was true that those three didn’t use their true strength earlier. The reason why they weren’t willing to fight the two god generals was that they wanted to keep their trump cards hidden.

Facing the incoming attack, Lin Yun merely twisted his body to dodge the incoming palm. As a hundred thousand golden-purple dragon runes wandered on his body, he shattered the palm of lightning and flame without any hindrance.

This made Xiao Yunqi lock his brows before pushing his palms forth. When he unleashed a barrage of palms, just the aftermath of his attacks alone was enough to inflict heavy injuries on any Dragon Pulse Ranking geniuses.

As Lin Yun moved across the squares on the stage, he relied on his Sword Heart to avoid the incoming attacks at the right time. Not only did he dodge his opponent’s attacks, but he could even occasionally counterattack, either facing them with his palm or sweeping with the sword scabbard.

On the contrary, this placed Xiao Yuanqi in a passive position and had to be on guard at all times. It was as though Lin Yun could counterattack at the right time and angle. No matter how powerful his attacks were, he couldn’t even touch Lin Yun’s clothes.

This made Xiao Yuanqi furious and wanted to use his ghost spirit martial techniques, but he couldn’t lower himself to use it first when Lin Yun didn’t. Ten-odd moves later, Lin Yun pushed his palm forth, catching Xiao Yuanqi by surprise.

When Lin Yun’s palm fell onto Xiao Yuanzi’s chest, a dragon roar echoed and he poured the hundred thousand dragon runes into this strike. His hand manifested into a dragon claw, and he sent Xiao Yuanqi back with a gentle shove.

After he landed on the ground, he took three steps back before regaining his footing. He felt embarrassed that he couldn’t even injure Lin Yun when he had a higher cultivation.

“Allow me!” Just when Xiao Yuanqi wanted to make a move, a figure dashed out. It was the Autumn Mountain Lord. As a dragon roar echoed from the Autumn Mountain Lord’s body, he was enveloped in a golden light while executing the Imperial Overlord Physique, causing ripples to spread out through the air before he even got close.

Under the immense pressure, the surrounding space became like a quagmire. If it was someone with a weaker cultivation, they would be immobilized under this aura. Disregarding the suppression from a higher cultivation, just the Imperial Overlord Physique was enough to make the will of any geniuses in the same cultivation crumble.

As a golden light shone on Lin Yun’s body, his gaze became sharp. Because of the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent, Lin Yun’s movements weren’t restricted at all.

When the two got close, they exchanged more than ten moves in the blink of an eye. But Lin Yun only used one hand while the Autumn Mountain Lord used two. His cultivation was only slightly weaker than Xiao Yuanqi, and his dragon pulses were only four thousand feet.

Combining the Imperial Overlord Physique and Earth Intent, the Autumn Mountain Lord was like a mountain standing before Lin Yun. Every move was like the breath of a mountain, majestic and powerful.

Lin Yun didn’t fight him head-on. He avoided the Autumn Mountain Lord’s attacks with his Sword Heart head-on. He was like an azure dragon when he flew out, and his feet were like two dragon claws firmly grabbing the ground. His palms also manifested into dragon claws, and he had activated the Azure Dragon Intent.

When he occasionally raised his head, his eyes were like the eyes of a dragon, accompanied by a massive and pure dragon aura. That was the Azure Dragon Eyes.

Ten moves later, Lin Yun finally found a flaw in the Autumn Mountain Lord’s attack, and he launched his attack. When the Autumn Mountain Lord saw this scene, the corner of his lip curled up because he deliberately revealed this flaw on purpose.

He wasn’t like Xiao Yuanqi. He not only possessed the saint physique, but he cultivated the powerful body-refining technique of the Golden Dragon’s lineage, the Imperial Overlord Physique. In addition to Earth Intent, this bestowed him a physique that no one in the same generation could match. So this meant it was impossible for him to easily shove Xiao Yuanqi away.

He could already tell that Lin Yun had a terrifying attainment in martial dao, and the latter was also proficient in finding the opening of his opponent’s attacks. Not to mention Lin Yun also had a powerful movement technique.

It was difficult for him to restrict Lin Yun’s movements. But he could use himself as bait for Lin Yun to launch an attack on him. The moment Lin Yun attacked him, he could use the advantage of his physique to crush Lin Yun’s wrist. Even if he couldn’t crush Lin Yun’s wrist, he could still drag Lin Yun over before unleashing a barrage of attacks. At that time, Lin Yun would be at his mercy.

But when Lin Yun’s palm was about to come in contact with his chest, he suddenly raised two fingers forth like a sharp sword, tapping the Autumn Mountain Lord’s chest.

Accompanied by a loud explosion, this made Autumn Mountain Lord in pain, and the corner of his lip even twitched from the pain.

As a golden light rippled from his body, it was like ice splitting apart. Lin Yun then turned his fingers into a palm and printed it on the Autumn Mountain Lord’s chest. This made Lin Yun feel like his palm was landing on a mountain. Even if there were already some cracks in the Imperial Overlord Physique, Lin Yun only managed to push the Autumn Mountain Lord back by four feet with great difficulty.

“You’re not the only one with the Dragon Clan’s body-refining technique!” Flames of rage blazed within the Autumn Mountain Lord’s pupils, and he slanted forth before using his palm like a blade that was being swung down.

But he never expected that when Lin Yun attacked, he already thought of all the possibilities that would come next. When he pushed the Autumn Mountain Lord away, Lin Yun used the sword scabbard to stab the ground, plunging it an inch into the ground.

Lin Yun followed up by soaring to the sky before stomping his foot on the Autumn Mountain Lord’s chest. But he didn’t stop there and spun in the air three times, imprinting countless footprints on the Autumn Mountain Lord’s chest as he moved.

Each foot was infused with a hundred thousand golden-purple dragon runes. After he spun in the air three times, the Autumn Mountain Lord was knocked back. When the latter landed on the ground and his foot fell, it caused the Thunderblood Battlestage to tremble. The tremor was so great that many people couldn’t avoid it in time and were sent flying into the air.

The Autumn Mountain Lord let out a groan when he landed on the ground, and his facial expression was ugly.

On the other hand, Lin Yun spread his arms apart and gently landed on the Flower Burial Sword with great agility. As his hair fluttered in the wind, this made him look dashing in his white robe.
