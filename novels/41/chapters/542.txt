Chapter 543 - Fight Breaks Out!

The pillar was over three thousand meters tall as it stood between heaven and earth emitting a bone-chilling cold. Just touching it left many core disciples heavily injured as they lost their ability to fight.

Everyone had already experienced how powerful it was, so Lin Yun naturally attracted everyone’s attention when he charged over. All the inner disciples, core disciples, and even elders were looking at Lin Yun, wondering if he could do it.

Yang Xiong and the rest weren’t in a hurry. Just like everyone else, they had doubt in their eyes. They felt that Lin Yun was too bold to charge at the pillar.

But before their doubt could last long, Lin Yun roared, “In the name of my sword, bloom!”

A gigantic Iris Flower appeared above his head. When the Iris Flower spun, Lin Yun stuttered his steps before he shot into the sky like an arrow and pierced through the pillar. When the light disappeared, Lin Yun was firmly standing on the surface of the lake inside the pillar.

“He’s in!” Everyone exclaimed as they looked at Lin Yun. Right at this moment, three figures soared into the sky. They were naturally Yang Xiong, Lu Zhan, and Qi Wenxiong. The three of them were half a step away from the Yang stage, so they were a lot stronger than the other core disciples.

The three of them made their moves at the same time, but Yang Xiong ended up being at the front of the group. He emitted a powerful origin energy as purple lightning crackled on his skin while he charged into the pillar.

Lu Zhan, on the other hand, was enveloped by spiritual runes that converged into a ferocious beast that tore apart the pillar. Looking at the pillar covered with cracks, Lu Zhan smiled and he threw out a punch, “Break!”

As for Qi Wenxiong, he used an even more barbaric method as he charged into the pillar by relying on his physical body. He relied on his cultivation to resist the chill from the pillar as he entered. When he landed on the ground, he merely shook his body and the layer of ice that covered him had instantly disintegrated.

When the four of them entered, the other inner disciples gained courage to try. After all, even Lin Yun made it. However, not one of them succeeded. They were either sealed in ice or were sent flying.

It took a while before everything calmed down, but once it did, the crowd looked at Lin Yun with a grave expression. This time, no one dared to underestimate him anymore. After all, Lin Yun had relied on his own strength to enter.

As time passed, the suction force coming from the vortex grew even more powerful, making the flame pillar seem even more radiant. But not many people paid attention to that as their attention was on the four individuals inside the pillar. After all, the Nine Petals Profound Yin Flower would go to one of them. Not only that, but that person would also receive a fourth grade pellet personally refined by the dean.

Naturally, everyone wanted to see who would be the winner. It was only a matter of time before the battle began. Everyone observed Yang Xiong with great expectation. After all, they hadn’t forgotten what Yang Xiong said.

He said that he would greatly humiliate Lin Yun if Lin Yun dared to show up. Everyone felt that it would be one-sided, but the fact that Lin Yun made it this far revealed that the situation was even more interesting than they initially thought.

Everyone was waiting to see how Yang Xiong would react. Just like Yang Xiong, the other three looked calm for now. Of the four of them, only Yang Xiong had a grudge with Lin Yun. So, Lu Zhan and Qi Wenxiong stood pretty close to each other as they looked at Yang Xiong from a slight distance.

Everyone knew that the flower was in the vortex, but it wouldn’t be easy to obtain. It wouldn’t even be easy for Yang Xiong who was the strongest here. If the situation fell into a stalemate, then it would only benefit others. The nervous atmosphere slowly brewed between the four of them and they were preparing themselves by circulating origin energy throughout their body.

“Lu Zhan, Qi Wenxiong, the two of you are looking forward to me dealing with that brat, right? Since that’s the case, then what are you guys standing here for?!” smiled Yang Xiong. He then turned into a bolt of lightning and charged at the two of them.

His fist was filled with origin energy that crackled with lightning. This sudden attack had exceeded many people’s expectations because no one had imagined that Yang Xiong would start with Lu Zhan and Qi Wenxiong first.

This made Lu Zhan and Qi Wenxiong’s faces change as they quickly put up their defences. In the next second, the three of them clashed together and the shockwave caused the surrounding air particles to tremble.

When everything settled down, Lu Zhan and Qi Wenxiong both took a few steps back as they seemed to be on the losing side. Although Yang Xiong had the element of surprise to force the two back, it was also a statement to his strength.

Calming the origin energy within his body, Lu Zhan looked at Yang Xiong, “Senior Brother Yang, you’re worried that we’ll backstab you when you fight with that brat, right? Don’t worry. We won’t stoop so low before there’s an outcome.”

“Neither will I. Even if the Nine Nether Profound Yin Flower appears, we’ll fight for it after you deal with him,” said Qi Wenxiong. At the same time, they both retreated to the edge of the pillar.

This scene had made many people look at Yang Xiong in a new light because no one expected that Yang Xiong had such meticulous thoughts. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Since Lu Zhan and Qi Wenxiong had both given their promises publically, they wouldn’t dare to go against it. This way, Yang Xiong could focus on dealing with Lin Yun.

“At least you guys are tactful,” sneered Yang Xiong as he turned to look at Lin Yun. “Interesting. I’m surprised that you have the courage to stand before me.”

“What’s the matter? Do you think that I’m going to work with the two of them to deal with you?” Lin Yun’s black pupils flickered with a cold gleam and he said, “It never crossed my mind.”

Yang Xiong was briefly stunned by those words before he sneered, “You’re stronger than I imagined. But you’re still going to end up as a joke. I’ll let everyone here know that you’re nothing before me!”

Lin Yun squinted his eyes with a smile, “What a coincidence. I also share the same thoughts. Not only that, but the Nine Petals Profound Yin Flower is also mine!”

“Haha. I’m afraid you’ll have to be disappointed.” Yang Xiong wore a mocking smile on his lips as he released his origin energy. His black clothes began to crackle with lightning that enveloped him. It caused fluctuations that compressed the spiritual energy in the atmosphere.

Thunderblaze Solar Radiance!

Yang Xiong’s Thundermist Art had reached the seventh stage, which surprised many disciples watching the battle. The Thundermist Art was a transcendent earth grade cultivation technique that was famed for being hard to cultivate. The fact that Yang Xiong could reach the seventh stage in it meant that his strength was comparable to those in the top ten.

Lu Zhan and Qi Wenxiong’s faces both changed when they saw this scene.

“I hope that you can give me some pressure. Otherwise, it’ll be too boring if I finish you so quickly,” sneered Yang Xiong with a killing aura flashing in his eyes.

“This fellow…” Lin Yun’s expression turned grave. He knew that he couldn’t underestimate Yang Xiong, but so what? Yang Xiong’s cultivation technique was nothing in front of his Iris Sword Sutra, not to mention that he had reached the peak ninth stage in it.

As the Iris Flower bloomed within his violet palace, Lin Yun’s pupils flashed brightly. Everyone could sense a boundless fighting spirit blazing in Lin Yun as he said, “Make your move!”
