Chapter 991 - Nothing To Do With You

Lin Yun was sucked into the vortex by the black ocean. Afterwards, his bones shattered, his skin dried up, and his organs were burned to a crisp. If it wasn’t for his beating heart, he would be no different from a corpse. Even Lin Yun’s mind shut off for a brief moment. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

As the azure dragon’s heart throbbed, a mysterious dao rhyme echoed out in the black ocean. Countless threads of light rippled as Lin Yun’s heartbeat perfectly synced with the mysterious dao rhyme. He could even sense that when his heartbeat matched the azure dragon’s heartbeat, the violent black blood in his body was swiftly being purified as it left behind its essence. Golden strands of dragon blood were flowing through his entire body as he was being reforged.

Under the golden dragon blood’s nourishment, Lin Yun’s withered body was swelling up as his shattered bones and internal organs were reforged. It was as though he had risen from the ashes and had a new lease on life because of the dragon blood.

As time slowly passed, the radiance emitted from Lin Yun grew stronger at the bottom of the black ocean. Gradually, more light shined out of his pores and lit the entire ocean bottom. Throughout the process, the speed of his physique recovered even faster.

Ten days later, Lin Yun’s physique had completely recovered. When his drooped finger twitched, he slowly opened his eyes. The moment he clenched his fist, he could feel an immense power that brought the strength of his body to a new height. He even had signs of his Azure Dragon Battle Physique reaching a higher realm.

“Life and death…” Lin Yun muttered before he finally understood what those words meant. So it turned out that this was the real test. He needed to go through life and death in order to pass the test. It turned out that the dragon spirit had given him a hint. But even if he knew what to do beforehand, it would require great courage.

For example, if Lin Yun didn’t maintain his composure at the last moment, he wouldn’t have synced with the azure dragon’s heartbeat. In fact, he would be dead right now. It might have been pure luck that he didn’t fall into the bottom of the ocean.

“That’s…” Suddenly, Lin Yun locked his brows together because he saw many shocking scenes at the bottom of the ocean. There were countless corpses floating around. The corpses were plastered with either fear or happiness in their last moments alive.

Clearly, these were the people who failed the test in the past. It was an eerie sight that made Lin Yun’s scalp tingle. After recovering his physique, Lin Yun circulated his aura oceans with an ancient seal in his palm, “Divine Sun Breaking Seal!”

Making a fist, Lin Yun threw a punch as a majestic sun exploded from the bottom of the ocean. Along with a huge explosion, the shockwave from the Divine Sun Breaking Seal pushed him towards the surface of the ocean as he shot towards the sky.

The sky was dark with the only light source coming from the lightning. Looking at this terrifying scene, Lin Yun let out a long breath because the surface of the ocean felt more amicable than the bottom of the ocean.

“Time for me to go…” Lin Yun looked ahead at the end of the ocean with flames jumping around like a bright sun. He knew that he only had one more test. After going through life and death, Lin Yun leisurely walked on the surface of the ocean. Even the faint dragon aura in the atmosphere had weakened.

His pace was much faster as his heart was filled with hope for the azure dragon’s heart. After seven days of traveling, he faced another huge wave created by black lightning..

When the huge wave rose, a golden figure dashed through the domineering wave like a golden crow. Just like before, the lightning spread throughout his body. However, Lin Yun barely felt the pain this time. On the contrary, the lightning tempered his physique.

“This is a really great place to temper my physique. Even if there isn't a body-refining technique later, I can at least improve my physique to an unbelievable height.” Lin Yun muttered while looking at the flames up ahead. It was unlike what he had imagined initially. The flames didn’t belong to a sun, but to a palace. He could now see a majestic light screen that was splitting the ocean in two.

“Found you!” Lin Yun’s eyes blazed as he could finally see the inheritance. Pushing the Golden Crow Nine Transformations to the limit, Lin Yun charged towards the light screen without any hesitation.

Simultaneously, Luo Chen arrived at a desolate sword mound in the azure dragon’s horns inheritance. There was an ancient sword inserted at the center of a tattered stone stage that emitted an ancient aura.

With flickering eyes, Luo Chen pulled out the sword without any hesitation. A cold flash shined from the sword and Luo Chen realized it was an ancient dao artifact. But before he could rejoice, the sword broke into countless pieces that hovered in the sky. Each fragment was engraved with an ancient rune.

“I see…” Luo Chen finally saw what was going on. The runes engraved on those fragments represented the inheritance of the azure dragon’s horns. It was probably an extremely powerful sword technique with earth-shattering might. It was exceedingly rare and most likely a complete monarch fortune sword technique.

After getting to know Lin Yun and seeing his sky sword intent, this inheritance could no longer satisfy Luo Chen. Raising his head to the sky, Luo Chen spoke with fiery eyes, “Lord Dragon Spirit, I’ve already passed the test. Where’s the opportunity above fortune?”

“Your test isn’t complete,” replied the dragon spirit coldly. It didn’t even bother telling Luo Chen about the opportunity above fortune.

“Incomplete? How is that possible? I nearly gave up several times, so how can it not be complete…” Luo Chen was stunned because this wasn’t something that he could accept. The sword technique might be strong, but it wasn’t worth it since he couldn’t obtain the opportunity above fortune. Furthermore, there might be a situation where the winner takes all in the Azure Dragon Palace.

After all, no one would be able to defeat the person who obtained the opportunity above fortune. But no matter what he said, he couldn’t get a response from the dragon spirit. Similar scenes occurred for QIn Lin and Jun Mengchen. They passed their tests, but they were told that their tests weren’t complete.

In the azure dragon’s eyes inheritance, Pei Xue obtained an ancient secret technique. However, she was also told that her test was incomplete. Pei Xue pondered briefly before she asked, “Has someone passed the test completely yet?”

“There is one,” replied the dragon spirit indifferently. When Pei Xue heard that, her face changed as she wondered if it was ‘that’ person.

In the azure dragon’s tail inheritance, Yu Haotian managed to complete the test with the help of the mysterious demonic spirit. He had doubled his strength and successfully obtained his inheritance. It was a profound movement technique that could allow him to transform into an azure dragon for travel. He could also transform into an azure dragon and attack with its tail. He obtained a useful technique for running and defending.

“You’re not the first person to pass the test in its entirety. So the opportunity above fortune has nothing to do with you,” said the dragon spirit to Yu Haotian who was initially filled with confidence. The smile on Yu Haotian’s face froze before he was filled with a sinking feeling. Since the opportunity above fortune had nothing to do with him, who obtained it?
