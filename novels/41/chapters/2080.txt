Chapter 2081: Trouble

Almost every inn was discussing the battle that happened during the day. The battle was too exciting since both sides had played their cards one after another. In the end, the eight statues were even destroyed along with the collapse of the lake. As a result, the Hidden Sword Manor naturally suffered grave losses, not to mention that they even lost to Ye Qingtian.

A Quasi-Saint at the Indigo Origin Phase lost to Ye Qingtian, who was at the eighth transformation of the Nirvana Stage. They were thoroughly shocked by the battle.

Ye Qingtian from Eastern Desolation was like a rising sun that shone even brighter than Jian Jingtian. There was no question that Ye Qingtian’s name would spread throughout the Kunlun Realm after this battle.

“As long as Ye Qingtian reaches the Quasi-Saint Realm before the Blue Dragon Record appears, his name will be on it.”

“Ye Qingtian is promising. His cultivation is low, and his reputation isn’t comparable to the champions of the nine heavenly paths and golden geniuses of the various holy lands. But he cannot be disregarded once he rises.”

“He’s too young, but his age is also his advantage. He will grow to the same level as the Eastern Desolation’s Three Sword Saints in the future. Who knows, he might even be able to catch up with the Sword Emperor.”

“Don’t be too sure about that. He hasn’t reached the Quasi-Saint Realm yet. The holy sons and golden geniuses from the other holy lands aren’t pushovers. Everyone is now waiting for the Blue Dragon Record to appear. You’ll know what the Golden Era is like when it appears.”

“That’s right. Many underdogs might appear then, and a prosperous age is arriving.”

The battle during the day was heavily discussed and was an eye-opening experience for everyone.

In the Black Plume Palace’s branch within Nether Ethereal City, there was a massive courtyard with high-rise palaces and various rare beasts. Compared to the Heavenly Dao Sect’s relatively shabby branch, the scale of this courtyard was no different from a small-scale sect with countless experts.

As one of the immortal holy lands of the Sword Alliance, the Black Plume Palace was naturally more prestigious than the Heavenly Dao Sect. After all, this place wasn’t the Eastern Desolation. Only the Snowfrost Saint Palace and Myriad Sword Pavilion could be compared to them.

In a secluded and quiet hall, Zhao Wuji was hosting a banquet for a few distinguished guests. They were the Soaring Cloud Sect’s Zhang Ping, Aquamoon Sword Mountain’s Wang Cheng, and Misty Rain Manor’s Qin Xuan. The three were at the pinnacle ninth transformation of the Nirvana Stage and could reach the Quasi-Saint Realm at any time. They’ve all grasped the Quasi-Astral Sword Intent, and could be considered geniuses.

“Brother Wang, Brother Zhang, and Brother Qin, what do you three think of my suggestion?” Zhao Wuji smiled as he played with the wine glass in his hand.

Zhang Ping sipped the wine and said, “I have nothing wrong with it. After all, no one will be willing to let him leave with a Sovereign Saint Sword. But isn’t it too much for us to directly snatch it?”

Zhao Wuji smiled, “I didn’t decide on it alone. I have discussed this with seven of the eighteen holy lands, and no one is willing to see an outsider take the Sovereign Saint Sword away.” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

The Misty Rain Manor’s Qin Xuan was briefly stunned before he smiled, “I thought I was the only one.”

“But he’s a disciple of the Heavenly Dao Sect,” Aquamoon Sword Mountain’s Wang Cheng said cautiously.

“The current Heavenly Dao Sect isn’t the same as before. What can the Eastern Desolation do to the Southern Border?” Zhao Wuji smiled in disdain. “My Black Plume Palace isn’t afraid of the Heavenly Dao Sect. They only have a small courtyard within Nether Ethereal City, and there’s only a Heavenly Origin Phase Quasi-Saint Realm here. The only one we have to be careful of is the Indigo Thunder Quasi-Saint. That’s a peak master of the Heavenly Dao Sect, and he’s only one step away from stepping into the Saint Realm.”

Zhang Ping’s eyes lit up, and said, “That means there are no Saint Realm experts here? If I remember correctly, the Black Plume Palace’s branch here has a Saint Realm expert, right?”

That was one of Zhao Wuji’s confidences. After all, Saint Realm experts were rare in holy lands, and they wouldn’t be carelessly dispatched. There was a Saint Realm expert here within Nether Ethereal City because the Black Plume Palace frequently interacted with Hidden Sword Manor.

“But that is only a last resort,” Zhao Wuji said. After all, it was rare for Saint Realm experts to be involved in a conflict between holy lands. If Saint Realm experts were involved, the nature of the matter would change, and it would easily develop into a war between two forces.

There would be no turning back when a war occurs, especially colossi like the Heavenly Dao Sect and Black Plume Palace. They involved many forces, and a war between them would greatly affect them.

Qin Xuan said, “Brother Zhao, what should we do if they leave through a teleportation array?”

“The teleportation array is under the control of Hidden Sword Manor, so they can’t just leave as they want. Besides, who knows if there won’t be any accidents?”

There was a hidden meaning in Zhao Wuji’s smile, which was instantly understood by the trio.

“Can it be that Hidden Sword Manor…” Zhang Ping probed.

Zhao Wuji nodded, “Not everyone in the Hidden Sword Manor wishes the Sovereign Saint Sword to be taken away. He can obtain it, but it’s not his decision if he can leave with it. At that time, your three sects will be on the sidelines while the seven sects seal their path of retreat. The Black Plume Palace will personally act, and we’ll be responsible for it if anything happens!”

The trio heaved a sigh of relief when they heard that. It was fine as long as the Black Plume Palace was willing to stand out. To sword dao holy lands like them, they naturally weren’t willing to see the Sovereign Saint Sword being taken by an outsider, especially the Cauldron Sword.

“When everything ends, the Sovereign Saint Sword will be placed in the Black Plume Palace, and we will compete amongst ourselves three years from now. No matter who obtains the Sovereign Saint Sword, the other holy lands must be compensated,” Zhao Wuji gave a plan.

“That’s a good idea. No matter what, the sword has to be distributed amongst the Sword Alliance. We’re united, and there’s no need to differentiate each other,” Zhang Ping said.

“That’s fair,” Wang Cheng said.

Qin Xuan briefly pondered, then said, “Isn’t this too much?”

Zhao Wuji grinned, “So what? The Heavenly Dao Sect can come to retrieve it from my Black Plume Palace, if they’re capable.”

Zhao Wuji was confident that the Heavenly Dao Sect could only swallow it once the sword reached the Black Plume Palace. It was like how they didn’t dare to go to the Heavenly Dao Sect to retrieve it the moment the sword reaches the Heavenly Dao Sect.

But since the sword hasn’t recognized a master and was in Ye Qingtian’s hands, that was a different story.

Wang Cheng frowned, “The Heavenly Dao Sect only sent out a Quasi-Saint? Isn’t that weird?”

Zhao Wuji sighed, “I’m afraid even the Heavenly Dao Sect didn’t expect that Ye Qingtian would be able to borrow the sword. They probably thought that he was just going through the procedure of the challenge.”

That had surpassed everyone’s expectations. After all, who could’ve thought that a genius swordsman from the Eastern Desolation would manage to borrow a Sovereign Saint Sword? No one had predicted it, and Feng Wuji was even more shocked than him, let alone others.

Lin Yun sat on a towering roof within the Heavenly Dao Sect's courtyard, overlooking the entire Nether Ethereal City. The flickering lamps looked like a blazing dragon.

The Sovereign Saint Sword many people dreamt of was casually placed beside him. He tried placing it into the interspatial bracelet, but he noticed that it was impossible without receiving the acknowledgment of the sword beforehand, and that was the same with the Iris Secret Realm.

So Lin Yun could only carry it with him. He looked up at the bright moon in the sky and muttered to himself as he recalled what the white-clothed bladesman said, “We will meet again…”

He also recalled how that person warned him not to draw the sword out entirely yet, and that his blade was waiting for his sword. At that time, not even fate could stop them.

“Still thinking about what happened during the day?” Lil’ Purple descended from the sky with her white dress.

“Yeah.” Lin Yun and Lil’ Purple naturally had no secrets, and he shared his experience with her. According to Lil’ Purple’s speculation, the person Lin Yun saw might be that lord, which shocked Lil’ Purple so much that her gaze changed when she looked at Lin Yun. Shockingly, the ‘broken sword’ within his body was related to that lord.

“Don’t think too much about it. Anyhow, you’re only a scumbag in my eyes. Even if that lord?comes back, don’t think that it’ll change the fact that you’re a scumbag,” Lil’ Purple said.

Lin Yun couldn’t help laughing when he heard that. Lil’ Purple said that because Lin Yun was a little confused, perhaps because he realized the vague connection between him and that lord. That person looked unfamiliar and inexplicably familiar at the same time.

This had never happened to him, and he wondered if there was a connection from his previous carnation. But was he still himself if it was related to his past carnation? This bewildered Lin Yun, but his mood improved after hearing Lil’ Purple’s words.

“Perhaps he’s waiting for that sword in your body and has nothing to do with you. It's your previous life, even if it has something to do with you. Anyhow, I only know you as Flower Burial Lin Yun!” Lil’ Purple said as she looked at Lin Yun. She continued, “Don’t even think about getting rid of me in your life!”

Lin Yun reached out, and Lil’ Purple stretched her hand and gave him a high-five. Under the moonlight, two palms came into contact, and they could feel the temperature between each other’s palms. Lin Yun and Lil’ Purple were lonely people who were bound together to a certain degree.

“You’re right. I’m Flower Burial, and no one can change that,” Lin Yun said. “Anyhow, I had enough of wearing this mask and must bring this sword back.”

Lin Yun held onto Cauldron Sword with an unprecedentedly firm expression. He wouldn’t have any more concerns after his master successfully made it through his tribulation, and he could walk out in public then. He still had to resolve his feud with Tian Xuanzi.

When the next morning arrived, on the roof, Lin Yun slowly opened his eyes.

The Indigo Thunder Peak Master anxiously arrived, saying, “Ye Qingtian, the teleportation array was destroyed by someone yesterday, and we can’t use it anytime soon. If we want to return, we can only head to Southern Border’s Sacred Alliance to use their teleportation array.”

Lin Yun’s expression remained unchanged as a strange light flashed through his eyes. He already guessed that it wouldn’t be that easy for someone to leave with the Cauldron Sword, and this made him wonder if it was the Hidden Sword Manor who was behind it or if someone else was behind it.

Seeing Lin Yun’s surprisingly calm expression, the Indigo Thunder Peak Master said in surprise, “Ye Qingtian, you don’t seem surprised.”

Lin Yun reached out to grab the Cauldron Sword. He said, “Relax. Since it’s in my hands, it’s not that easy to get it from me.”
