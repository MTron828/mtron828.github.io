Chapter 2302 - Hardworking!

Lil’ Purple even held onto Lin Yun’s arm and started swaying him, which could only make Lin Yun smile bitterly.

“Are you coming with me?” Lil’ Purple still didn’t give up.

Lin Yun tried his best to break free from Lil’ Purple and smiled, “Let me ask you. What are you going to do after finding it?”

“Retrieve it,” Lil’ Purple replied.

“Steal it?”

“I-I’m just going to borrow it. I believe the holy master won’t be that petty. Furthermore, everyone here possesses the phoenix bloodline, and they might have been my servants in the past. So I’m just taking something that belongs to me,” Lil’ Purple said.

Lin Yun smiled, “Alright. I’ll call the Astral River Saint Sovereign over. You can disclose your identity at that time, and they’ll all worship you.”

“I’ll go if you’re not going.” Lil’ Purple snorted.

When Lil’ Purple was about to run off, Lin Yun was briefly stunned before he held onto her and said, “Let me finish.”

“Hmph, doesn’t the Sinful Fire Divine Rune belong to me? You scumbag, let go of me…” Lil’ Purple struggled.

Lin Yun appeased Lil’ Purple and said, “Let’s plan again. You couldn’t even take the Solar Lunar Divine Rune without anyone noticing, so how will you seal the Sinful Fire Divine Rune?”

“Hmph, I’m much stronger than before. You only need to let me borrow the Iris Sword Box, and I can take it without anyone noticing,” Lil’ Purple said.

“What about me, then?” Lin Yun smiled bitterly.

“You can stay behind and marry that little princess. She’s pretty fond of you, and you can take this opportunity to steal her heart,” Lil’ Purple said.VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Lin Yun felt a headache after hearing that and realized he couldn’t persuade Lil’ Purple. After gathering three Sovereign Divine Runes, the Iris Secret Realm had transformed, as well as Lil’ Purple, giving her more confidence. She was so confident in retrieving the Sinful Fire Divine Rune that she didn’t even place Divine Phoenix Mountain in her eyes. So he had to find a way to appease her for now.

Lin Yun briefly pondered and smiled, “Alright, I’ll go with you.”

“Really? Hehe. We’re good brothers. Give me a high-five!” Lil’ Purple smiled as they gave each other a high-five.

“There’s no need to hurry,” Lin Yun said. “I gained a lot of harvest in the God Burial Mountain Range, so I still need to digest my comprehension. We’ll go when I’m much stronger.”

Lil’ Purple pondered, before she nodded, “Your words make sense. Every time you finish a fight, your strength will undergo a growth after going into seclusion.”

Lin Yun heaved a sigh in relief since he had finally calmed Lil’ Purple down, for now. If they wanted to look for the Sinful Fire Divine Rune, it would be best for them to go together. If she went by herself, who knew what would happen?

Lin Yun briefly pondered, then said, “Speaking of which, can you speed up time in the Iris Secret Realm?”

“I can. There’s a time-space array in the Iris Secret Realm. I can let you cultivate for six to seven days each time, and it will only be half a day in the outside world,” Lil’ Purple said. “I can’t let you cultivate for months or years like in the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda.”

“That’s enough. What should I do?” Lin Yun asked. He wanted to consolidate his cultivation now and not go into seclusion.

“Do you still have divine dragon saint liquid on you? Pour it all on the Phoenix Tree and let it activate,” Lil’ Purple said.

“Okay.” Lin Yun took out all the remaining divine dragon saint liquid and poured it on the Phoenix Tree. When the Phoenix Tree shone brightly, a massive array appeared around the Phoenix Tree.

“It can only last for seven days. Don’t act disrespectful, or the Phoenix Tree will be heartbroken,” Lil’ Purple said as she caressed the Phoenix Tree.

Lin Yun nodded with a smile.

“Okay, you can cultivate here.” Lil’ Purple was straightforward, before visiting the Divine Bamboo Forest’s region.

Lin Yun sat beneath the Phoenix Tree, thanking it. He wasn’t in a hurry to cultivate. He reached out and vines spread out, before forming a flower in his palm. This was the Othershore Flower he had obtained in the Heavenly Void. It looked dreamy and unrealistic.

“You can cultivate here as well,” Lin Yun smiled.

“Thank you, Master. I like this place,” the Othershore Flower thanked. The Phoenix Tree was watered with nearly fifty kilograms of divine dragon saint liquid, which nourished the Othershore Flower.

“Master, I will also grow up fast.” The Othershore Flower’s roots burrowed to the ground and swayed its petals, releasing a dreamy radiance.

Even Lin Yun was briefly dazed by the flower and smiled, “Alright. Prepare more Mandala Fragrance for me.”

“Okay! I can sense that I can grow my bud now, hehe!” Surprisingly, the Othershore Flower’s response was straightforward.

Lin Yun smiled and no longer cared about the Othershore Flower. He closed his eyes with his palms resting on his knees. When he closed his eyes, the images of his battle outside the God Burial Mountain Range flashed. It sater with his first fight against a fourth-stage Saint Lord then his fight against a Saint Sovereign at the end.

He had a lot of comprehension in his fight with a Saint Sovereign. A Saint Sovereign was too powerful and he could only obtain a slight advantage, even after giving it his all. If they fought again, he would be swiftly defeated. He concluded he had to run if he ran into a Saint Sovereign.

He had gained more comprehension from his fight with the sixth-stage Saint Lords. After they brought out their golden pills, Lin Yun could sense a huge threat from his sword intent. If he didn’t have the Azure Saint Cloth, he would have been heavily injured, even if he didn’t die.

“My limit is to face a sixth-stage Saint Lord.” Lin Yun concluded, recalling his fight with the sixth-stage Saint Lords. An hour later, he opened his eyes and muttered, “The Divine Light Sword Intent doesn’t seem to be able to crush those sixth-stage Saint Lords. What is the reason for that?”

That was because their cultivation was too high. Logically speaking, they shouldn’t be so easily defeated by him. Lin Yun was smart, emphasising the smallest details. Even if he managed to defeat his opponent, he wasn’t proud to think he was invincible.

He closed his eyes and soon discovered that he found the key. With a flick of his finger, the scenes in his mind were simulated with his sword intent. He squinted and paid attention to every detail before muttering, “I see…”

He could sense that the saint energy of fourth-stage Saint Lords was powerful, but they couldn’t defend against his Divine Light Sword Intent. As for fifth-stage Saint Lords, their dao flowers would change. But after becoming a sixth-stage Saint Lord, their saint daos would increase more.

After becoming a fourth-stage Saint Lord, one could extract the dao from heaven and earth to control their dao. But a fifth-stage Saint Lord’s dao would increase further. A sixth-stage Saint Lord’s saint dao would’ve reached over ten thousand.

“This is a problem…” Lin Yun muttered. He grasped the Sword Dao, Thunder Dao, and Wind Dao. But the saint daos he could extract was barely a hundred. Those people relied on decades of accumulation to make up with numbers, even if their martial intent was weaker. In addition to the advantage of their cultivation, this was the reason why the Divine Light Sword Intent couldn’t defeat them as quickly.

Ultimately, it was because he was too young, and this was the conclusion he came up with. But if they heard what Lin Yun said, they would probably throw out blood. After all, Lin Yun wasn’t even thirty and had defeated them with his Divine Light Sword Intent. Despite his achievements, he still felt that he was lacking. This was because Lin Yun was too hardworking.

Lin Yun held onto his chin and muttered, “There are two ways to deal with this: rely on time or grasp a stronger dao, such as Senior Brother’s Space Dao.”

Space Dao was an Eternal Dao, and Ye Guhan could easily suppress his opponents with it.

“I can’t give up on Space Dao, not to mention that Senior Brother can’t teach it to me, either. I don’t have the talent, so I can only look at Nirvana Dao!” Lin Yun’s eyes shone brightly as his desire to grasp Nirvana Dao increased.

“If I can’t grasp Nirvana Dao, I can only defeat ten sixth-stage Saint Lords with my sword technique and divine physique, at best,” Lin Yun concluded. “If I run into those old monsters, I might be defeated.”

Lin Yun concluded that he had to grasp Nirvana Dao no matter what!
