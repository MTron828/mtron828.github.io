Chapter 147 - Who Else

Everyone kept their silence when the Wang Clan stood out. The Wang Clan had a Quasi-Profound Martial Realm cultivator and the rest of their group were sixth and seventh orifice experts. Furthermore, the resources of the three overlord forces in the Azure Sun County couldn’t match even a fraction of the Wang Clan.

So at the same cultivation level, they were much stronger. They had more resources and stronger martial techniques. There was a dramatic difference between a prestigious clan and ordinary cultivators.

The Blood Cloud Sect and Golden Flame Sect’s elders were also in the Quasi-Profound Martial Realm, but they could feel a gap between them and Wang Bo.

The aura emitting from Wang Bo was mighty like a tremendous mountain and unfathomable like a surging river. If they got close to him, they would be overwhelmed by his aura alone.

“Damn it…” Ming Ye bit his lips on the seventh lotus stage with hesitation. He wanted to help Lin Yun, but he was afraid of offending the Wang Clan.

But just when he finally made up his mind and wanted to get up, the grey-clothed elder beside him pressed him back down, “Don’t be reckless…”

Around the lotus stage occupied by the Sword Firmament Pavilion, a disciple asked, “Senior brother, has this person comprehended sword intent? If that’s the case, then he’s a talent and we can consider saving him.”

The Sword Firmament Pavilion’s disciples all practiced swords. So they naturally had a good impression of Lin Yun. With the Sword Firmament Pavilion’s strength, they could save Lin Yun if they wanted to as long as Bai Lixuan nodded his head.

“The Sword Firmament Pavilion won’t let him go if he comprehended the full sword intent. But it’s a pity… his sword intent is incomplete. He’s young, but he’s also arrogant.” Bai Lixuan replied indifferently. “These sorts of people are arrogant, not knowing where they stand. What’s the use of saving them? If they die one day because of their arrogance, it will lead to a waste of resources.”

His words were filled with contempt and disdain. In his eyes, Lin Yun was ignorant. But in reality, he had a high position in the Sword Firmament Pavilion, with resources and backing. So how could he understand the pain of someone insignificant?

If you don’t fight with your life on the ground, how would you be able to stand out? Lin Yun had no path of retreat today, but no one could get him off the lotus stage!

“Lin Yun, if you kneel, beg for mercy, and maintain my sword for me, my Wang Clan can consider letting you have that lotus stage!” Wang Ning sneered. He threw out a sword, which fell before Lin Yun.

Looking at this scene, the memories of everything that happened back in the Azure Sky Sect flashed in his mind. For a moment, he did not have any expression on his face.

He reached for the sword and pulled it into his hand. The sword reflected a golden gleam. It might only be an Intermediate-Grade Profound Artifact, but it wasn’t inferior to a High-Grade Profound Artifact in any way.

“I still thought that Lin Yun was a man. I never expected that he would give in so easily.”

“How is he any different from a beggar? Someone threw a bone at him and he immediately scrambled to pick it up.”

“He was insulting Wang Ning just a moment ago.”

Disdain sounded out from the surrounding. When they looked at Lin Yun, there was a hint of disgust on their faces.

Wang Ning sneered inwardly when he saw this situation. Lin Yun was still the sword slave back then. Do you really think that I will let you off even if you beg me to?

Wang Ning was pleased while looking at Lin Yun and smiled, “Lin Yun, why aren’t you maintaining my sword? Let everyone witness the demeanor of a sword slave. I remember that you’re particularly skilled when it comes to maintaining swords…”

Lin Yun pulled out the sword and gently snapped it. In a split second, this Mid-Grade Profound Artifact had broken into pieces and fell onto the ground.

Clang! Clang! Clang!

Looking at the sword, Lin Yun grinned innocently, “Sure enough, this is a piece of garbage. Only garbage like you would match with this garbage sword. Junior brother truly feels embarrassed about breaking your sword accidentally. Why don’t you give me another sword to try?”

Lin Yun’s smile was innocent, but he had slapped Wang Ning’s face with his words.

“My Autumn Shine Sword!” Wang Ning’s expression turned ugly. He was literally laughing a few seconds ago. This was a Mid-Grade Profound Artifact, forged by the best swordsmith in the Wang Clan. It was stronger than ordinary High-Grade Profound Artifacts, but Lin Yun actually broke his sword!

At this moment, everyone couldn’t help smiling when they saw this scene. So it turns out that Lin Yun wanted to mess with Wang Ning. Right from the start, he had no intention of submitting.

“How stubborn. You must be courting death!” Wang Bo coldly snorted and unleashed his killing intent, causing a violent gale to rise in his surroundings.

His cold killing intent swept like a howling blizzard and some spectators couldn’t open their eyes from the sting.

“Old foggy, come if you want to kill me. I, Lin Yun, am not afraid of you!” Lin Yun stared back at Wang Bo indifferently.

“Since you’re so talkative, I’ll have to slap you!”

Whoosh! Whoosh!

Wang Bo disappeared from his position. He flickered through the distance with his hand raised against Lin Yun’s face. The combination of his cultivation and mobility made him unpredictable. When he raised his hand, it caused a burst of exclamation from the surrounding. If this slap were to hit, Lin Yun’s teeth would definitely break.

“You came at the right time!” Lin Yun flipped his hands, withdrawing his token calmly. He poured his coursing iris spiritual energy into the token. In the next second, dazzling dark rays shot out from the token along with a terrifying sword aura that made everyone feel terrified.

“What is that?”

“What strong sword aura… not even a Quasi-Profound Martial Realm is so terrifying, right?”

“What the hell?!”

Boom!

The dark rays converged into a shadowy grey-clothed figure. That figure emitted an aura of profound ancientness. He had a sword box on his back, and when he appeared from the dark rays, everyone looked at him with shock in their eyes.

“This is…?” Wang Bo paused in midair, looking at that grey-clothed figure. A trace of fear flashed in his eyes.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

While Wang Bo was feeling doubtful, the grey-clothed figure immediately slashed his sword down. In the blink of an eye, three terrifying sword rays descended swiftly. Wang Bo’s face changed and he dodged the two swords before facing the last with his palm.

Boom! ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The last sword exploded and Wang Bo was blasted away into the Wang Clan’s party.

“This is an intent from an ancient powerhouse!”

“Lin Yun really has a Cosmic Treasure with him!”

Everyone was shocked to see how the grey-clothed figure blasted Wang Bo with three swords. However, Lin Yun wore a grave expression. He did not dare to let his guard down. The Golden Flame Sect’s elder was heavily injured from the three swords, but Wang Bo did not suffer any grave injuries.

“Cultivators of the Wang Clan, obey my orders! Attack!” Wang Bo roared when he saw the grey-clothed figure charging at him.

In the next second, the Wang Clan’s cultivators all made their moves at the same time. They unleashed their attacks at the grey-clothed figure. However, the grey-clothed figure continued to walk and swing his sword.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

With every sword, a cultivator from the Wang Clan would be heavily injured. All the attacks directed at him crumbled before his sword. No one could stop him from swinging his sword.

The grey-clothed figure seemed invincible and everyone was dumbfounded watching him. With a sword in his hand, the grey-clothed figure swept through all the obstacles before him!

It didn’t take long for the Wang Clan’s cultivators to be filled with bloodcurdling wails as they laid on the ground. The grey-clothed figure’s power was beyond everyone’s comprehension.

“H-how…” The smile on Wang Ning’s face was replaced with despair. He was dumbfounded by the scene unfolding before him. Wang Bo unleashed a strong attack at a critical moment, stopping the grey-clothed figure’s ferocious advance.

“This is a good chance!” When the Blood Cloud Sect’s elder saw this scene, his eyes lit up. He wielded a crimson ruler and charged at Lin Yun. Lin Yun could sense the killing intent when the elder moved. He turned around and glared at the Blood Cloud Sect’s elder.

Whoosh!

When the two of them looked at each other, the Blood Cloud Sect’s elder was stunned. Thinking about the losses he suffered at Lin Yun’s hands, the movements of the Blood Cloud Sect’s elder paused briefly.

However, that brief pause allowed the grey-clothed figure to break free from his battle with Wang Bo. Turning around, the grey-clothed figure swung his sword at the Blood Cloud Sect’s elder without holding back. It was like a thundering roar that echoed across the horizon.

The Blood Cloud Sect’s elder had fear in his eyes and he retreated. He knew that he wouldn’t be able to block this sword. But it was too late. The sword struck his body and blasted him away.

Boom!

Fresh blood splattered and the Quasi-Profound Martial Realm elder could no longer get up on his feet. Lin Yun turned around and looked at the Blood Cloud Sect’s party coldly.

“Run!” Xue Tu’s face turned pale with fright. He picked up the Blood Cloud Sect’s elder and dashed away, forgetting about the lotus seat he occupied. He was afraid that Lin Yun would kill everyone from the Blood Cloud Sect in rage.

Lin Yun had scared off an overlord force of the Azure Sun County with just a glance. The Blood Cloud Sect even went as far as abandoning the lotus seat that they occupied.

The hazy figure that stood beside Lin Yun was unfathomable. The cultivators from the Wang Clan were catching breath with a relaxed expression. They were obviously terrified a moment ago.

“Who else is not convinced?” Lin Yun asked once more. But this time, no one dared to sound their objection.

“Uncle Bo…” Wang Ning gnashed his teeth with reluctance.

“Endure it for now. I’m injured and he might see through my state if you provoke him any further… it’s unwise.” Wang Bo whispered, signaling everyone from the Wang Clan to retreat.

Wang Ning was so terrified that his mouth dropped. He was utterly speechless. For a brief moment, everyone from the Wang Clan looked at Lin Yun with fear in their eyes.

Seeing that no one had any objections, Lin Yun reached out to summon the Flower Burial Sword back to him and stood firmly among the pile of corpses on the ground, “Then I’ll be having this lotus seat since no one disagrees.”
