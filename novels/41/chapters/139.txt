Chapter 140 - Extortion

His punch exploded forth with a terrifying aura and a cloud of dust surged out as he did this. He had combined the Iris Sword Sutra and Thunderblitz Battle Physique perfectly. This was the first time he had thrown out a punch at full power.

Dust and rocks flew out as a violent gale roared. The fifth orifice cultivators from the two sects were fearful in the face of Lin Yun’s approaching punch. However, they suppressed their feelings and faced Lin Yun head-on.

Boom!

The ground exploded with a thunderous commotion that sent the eight fifth orifice cultivators flying. They fell to the ground and took many steps back, but they couldn’t stabilize themselves from the collision. Of the eight, the four from the Blood Cloud Sect spat out a mouthful of blood, since the Blood Cloud Sect had a weaker defense.

Lin Yun had only used one punch to defeat eight fifth orifice cultivators and his cultivation was only in the fourth orifice of the Xiantian Realm. When the spectators saw this scene, they were left deeply shocked.

“You’re pretty strong…but it’s nothing compared to my Breaking Arms Fist!” Mei Zihua coldly snorted and charged out before the Blood Cloud Sect could respond.

Boom!

He took to the sky and threw a punch out at Lin Yun. His punch produced a powerful effect that swept through the surroundings. It was as if he could contend against an entire army by himself.

Judging by his aura alone, his punch was stronger than Lin Yun’s.

“Terrific!” Lin Yun raised his brow. He wanted to face Mei Zihua head-on and get back whatever he’d suffered in the past. Without any hesitation, he threw a punch back at Mei Zihua.

Boom!

When the two punches clashed, cracks began to spread out on the ground from the shockwave, causing fragments of rocks to blast out.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The two of them did not have any changes in their expression as they exchanged blows. Every single punch would cause a reverberating shockwave, turning the surrounding fragments of stone into ashes.

In the blink of an eye, the two had already exchanged over ten blows. Mei Zihua felt turmoil inside his body. He exclaimed out when he felt numbness in his arm, “How is this possible?!”

Throughout the entire fight, Lin Yun had utterly suppressed him. No matter how much he tried to circulate his Golden Flame Art, he couldn’t turn the tables around. After ten punches, the surging spiritual energy within his body had shown signs of collapsing.

“Hey, is that all you got? I’m barely warming up!” grinned Lin Yun. The Iris Flower exploded with radiance that poured into his fist. This time, the power contained in his fist was one-fold stronger than before.

Boom!

Before the punch even touched him, Mei Zihua was blasted away by the aura. By the time he fell to the ground, Lin Yun’s terrifying punch was about to reach him.

Unhesitantly, Mei Zihua retrieved the Demonic Flame Halberd from his interspatial pouch.

Rustle! Rustle! Rustle!

Mei Zihua panicked and blocked Lin Yun with the Demonic Flame Halberd. His face was pale from the impact and he took a few steps back.

Whoosh!

But when Lin Yun wanted to pursue Mei Zihua, he was suddenly assaulted by a crimson radiance aimed at his back. The radiance was like a venomous snake that bit at his neck.

Lin Yun immediately turned around and grabbed onto that crimson radiance. He looked down at his hand and saw that it was Xue Tu’s Crimson Blood Whip.

“It looks like you’ve gotten many things in the Azure Sun Realm, but you’re still too tender to fight me.” Xue Tu smiled eerily. Then, the Crimson Bone Whip spiraled up Lin Yun’s arm.

Xue Tu started injecting his crimson spiritual energy into the whip. In the next second, the Crimson Bone Whip tightened around Lin Yun’s arm.

Lin Yun tried to break free, but the whip continued to tighten instead.

“Little bastard, you’ve never seen a High-Grade Profound Artifact in your life, right? You want to try and break free from the Crimson Bone Whip? How naive.” Xue Tu snickered.

“Take one from me!” A cold light flickered through Mei Zihua’s eyes when he recovered from Lin Yun’s attack. He slammed his halberd down. The tip of the halberd was like a demonic flame that solidified the air.

Looking at two elites attacking Lin Yun with their High-Grade Profound Artifacts, the surrounding cultivators knew that Lin Yun was in danger.

“High-Grade Profound Artifacts, how envious…” Lin Yun looked at the Demonic Flame Halberd with strong emotion fluctuating in his eyes, “but it’s not easy to kill me with this!”

Lin Yun pulled with all his strength to force Xue Tu to collide in midair with Mei Zihua.

“My heavens!”

“How did he accomplish that…? Just how much strength does he need to do that? It must be nearly a hundred thousand catty of strength, right?”

“Perfect Thunderblitz Battle Physique! He must’ve reached the Perfect Thunderblitz Battle Physique!” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Just how much strength was needed to send a fifth orifice cultivator that wielded a High-Grade Profound Artifact into the air? Everyone was shocked by this scene.

Boom!

Mei Zihua and Xue Tu collided and the two of them spat out a mouthful of blood. Simultaneously, the Crimson Bone Whip that spiraled around Lin Yun’s hand slipped down. He tried moving his arm around and discovered that it was fine.

Superficial injuries couldn’t affect him when he was in the Thunderblitz Battle Physique. But he still had to be careful against the High-Grade Profound Artifacts. If someone with higher cultivation had used them, he wouldn’t be able to break free as easily.

“Damn it!” Mei Zihua and Xue Tu were both furious and pounced at Lin Yun. They both wielded their High-Grade Profound Artifacts. The combination of their cultivation and aura from their weapons was terrifying.

Lin Yun gently raised his hand and retrieved the Flower Burial Sword from the sword box.

Clang!

Swinging the sword, Lin Yun charged forward without any hesitation.

Thunderclap Sword Art—Violent Gale!

As Lin Yun’s wrist moved, he created 81 afterimages before they overlapped together. He also circulated the Iris Sword Sutra at the same time. The result was a thundering roar as Lin Yun’s sword fell.

Crack! Crack!

His sword had crushed the Mei Zihua and Xue Tu’s attacks at the same time. Mei Zihua and Xue Tu wanted to fight back, but they had to take a defensive position. The current situation made their facial expressions change.

Clang!

When Mei Zihua and Xue Tu took Lin Yun’s attacks, they could feel their arms going numb with pain. They nearly lost grip of their weapons. However, Lin Yun did not allow them to catch their breath and followed up with his attacks.

With a sword in his hand, Lin Yun’s presence had undergone a dramatic change. His long hair fluttered in the wind as he brimmed with confidence.

Clang! Clang! Clang!

Mei Zihua and Xue Tu couldn’t unleash the full might of their weapons under Lin Yun’s attacks. They felt oppressed, like a sailboat amidst a storm. It didn’t take long for the two of them to be covered in injuries and drenched in their own blood.

One with the sword, Incomplete Sword Intent!

Lin Yun’s aura suddenly changed, transforming into a more refined aura. His sword seemed to have fused with heaven and earth. Under Lin Yun’s sword, Mei Zihua kneeled on the ground with the Demonic Flame Halberd.

Whoosh!

Lin Yun spun and swung his sword down. When his sword flashed, the Crimson Bone Whip in Xue Tu’s hand went flying. Fresh blood sprayed out from Xue Tu as he received a horrifying wound on his chest.

“Fuck off!” Lin Yun then kicked Mei Zihua who was attempting to get on his feet.

Plop!

Mei Zihua was sent flying like a ragdoll. Lin Yun defeated Xue Tu with his sword and then kicked Mei Zihua. These were two of the Azure Sun County elites, but they actually lost even with their numerical advantage. This scene left the surrounding spectators shocked; they never imagined that the fight would develop in this manner.

Clang!

Lin Yun stabbed the Flower Burial Sword into the ground. The sword trembled and the remaining sword intent was etched into everyone’s heart.

“So, how long are you guys planning to watch?” Lin Yun crossed his arms and looked at the two Quasi-Profound Martial Realm cultivators with a smile.

The Blood Cloud Sect and Golden Flame Sect had sent out one Quasi-Profound Martial Realm cultivator each. But one of them was injured from the black hole and still hadn’t recovered.

This meant that the two sects combined only had one Quasi-Profound Martial Realm cultivator left.

“Holy shit...has he gone insane?”

“He’s actually challenging Quasi-Profound Martial Realm cultivators? Is he not afraid of dying?”

“I think the two Quasi-Profound Martial Realm cultivators have already intended on making a move, but they must be afraid of hurting Mei Zihua and Xue Tu!”

No one had expected that Lin Yun would target the two elders after defeating Mei Zihua and Xue Tu.

The Blood Cloud Sect and Golden Flame Sect’s elders exchanged a look. The two of them could see shock in each other’s eyes.

“The Cosmic Treasure belongs to you. My Blood Cloud Sect will not make a move at you in the Azure Sun Realm,” said the elder from the Blood Cloud Sect.

“My Golden Flame Sect also guarantees that we will not make a move at you in the Azure Sun Realm,” responded the elder from the Golden Flame Sect.

Surprisingly, the two elders actually took a step back. Although, they didn’t have a choice in the matter. The two did not think much about it when Lin Yun defeated the eight fifth orifice cultivators. However, when they saw Lin Yun defeat Mei Zihua and Xue Tu, while equipped with High-Grade Profound Artifacts, their faces turned grave.

With Mei Zihua and Xue Tu’s talents, no ordinary seventh orifice cultivator would be confident in defeating them, especially when they wielded High-Grade Profound Artifacts.

However, Lin Yun had utterly crushed them. It was especially apparent after he brought his sword out.

The two elders immediately knew that Lin Yun’s strength was unfathomable. Even if he couldn’t fight Quasi-Profound Martial Realm cultivators with his current strength, it wouldn’t be a problem for him to escape.

The two sects knew that they wouldn’t benefit from making things difficult for Lin Yun in the Azure Sun Realm. As for the Cosmic Treasure...it naturally belonged to Lin Yun in the Azure Sun Realm.

But once they were out, the two sects had tons of ways to get it from him. At that time, it would be a question of whether or not Lin Yun could keep his life, not to mention the Cosmic Treasure!

The two elders looked confident when they gave out their promise. They were confident that Lin Yun wouldn’t refuse it. However, Lin Yun kept quiet and looked at the two with a smile, which sent chills down their spine.

“You guys might intend to let me off, but I don’t intend to let you guys off!” Lin Yun squinted his eyes, showing a smile. His words were like a toxic needle, stabbing into the hearts of the two sects.

“Brat, don’t take it too far!” A Blood Cloud Sect’s disciple roared upon hearing Lin Yun’s arrogant speech.

Lin Yun’s smile immediately retracted and he flicked his fingers.

First Stage of the Divine Flicking Sword—Flashing Aura, Flicking Fingers!

A sword flash pierced through the air, buzzing while it stabbed into the head of the disciple who spoke, claiming his life instantly.

Lin Yun had killed someone instantly by flicking his fingers in front of two Quasi-Profound Martial Realm cultivators. His action had left everyone dumbfounded.

“Know your place…” Lin Yun’s smile disappeared with his eyes flickering coldly. Raising his head abruptly, he roared, “I know what you guys are planning, so listen well. Without 10,000 Xiantian pellets, don’t even dream of getting me to stay my hand. The two of you can’t do anything to me in the Azure Sun Realm, but everyone else can dream of staying alive!”
