Chapter 2232 - Boost In Cultivation

Kui’erdo died a miserable death with his body torn to pieces. Lin Yun’s sword intent also annihilated his saint origin and remnant soul in the eyeball, so he was completely dead.

“Big Brother, an interspatial bracelet!” Lin Yun turned to look at Lil’ Red, who was searching the corpse, and found something. But that wasn’t all. Lil’ Red didn’t let go of those demonic corpses.

Lin Yun smiled as he opened the interspatial bracelet with Lil’ Purple. They found pellets, saint crystals, a few Demonspirit Clan martial techniques, saint artifacts, and some secret treasures. But none of them were of high value.

“No divine blood?” Lin Yun searched for a long time but couldn’t find divine blood, which left him depressed. After all, he thought they would have a few of them, but that also made sense because even the Heavenly Dao Sect didn’t have much divine blood. Even if the Demonspirit Clan had divine blood, most of them should be in the hands of the Ying River King. These Saint Lords were only his tools.

“Let’s leave this place first,” Lin Yun said as he left with the group. They had already obtained the Othershore Flower, which the Asura Dove King and Ying River King would soon find out. It didn’t matter who won because they would come after him, so it was best for him to leave quickly. However, Lin Yun had to admit that he was curious about who would win.

They traveled for a few thousand miles and found a tattered palace before entering the Iris Secret Realm with Lil’ Red and Lil’ Purple.

Lin Yun instantly saw the Othershore Flower when they entered the Iris Secret Realm. It was too dazzling because it was over ten feet in size, and the entire Iris Secret Realm was dyed red, which made this place look like a dream.

“Holy shit, the Othershore Flower is treating this place as its home. Even the Phoenix Tree didn’t take it that far,” Lil’ Purple said unhappily as she looked at the Othershore Flower.

“Why did it grow so quickly?” Lin Yun asked in shock.

“It’s refining the three droplets of divine blood, but it will behave once it’s done. At that time, we can harvest it. So leave it be for now,” Lil’ Purple casually said. She wanted to leave the Othershore Flower alone, but the Flower Burial Sword couldn’t hold on any longer.

The Flower Burial Sword flew out by itself hovered around the sky of the Othershore Flower, devouring the crimson radiance. When it returned to Lin Yun’s hand, it became much stronger.

“Still only three glory spirits. I have to find a way to unlock the fourth.” Lin Yun held onto the Flower Burial Sword and swung it around, with the sword emitting a faint crimson radiance. A Threespirit Glory Saint Artifact was sufficient for now, but he must upgrade it as his cultivation rose.

“One fine day, you will have seven glory spirits, becoming a Sovereign Saint Artifact. You will become a sword that is stronger than any other,” Lin Yun said as he caressed the sword. He might have another Sovereign Saint Artifact, but he couldn’t unleash the full power.

But the Flower Burial Sword was different because it had accompanied him throughout his journey, and they had long surpassed the relationship of a sword and its master.

The Flower Burial Sword trembled as a form of response to Lin Yun. The day it unlocks seven glory spirits, it would be able to achieve a resonance with the Heaven Burial Constellation and become a Sovereign Saint Artifact.

“You have become strong now that you can even kill a second-stage Saint Lord,” Lil’ Purple looked at Lin Yun.

“They had exhausted themselves while trying to ripen the Othershore Flower. I was just lucky,” Lin Yun said calmly.

“Alright, stop showing off. You’re not at your strongest yet and have other trump cards. You think I don’t understand you well?” Lil’ Purple looked at Lin Yun unhappily.

“I guess so,” Lin Yun replied. He then changed the topic, “What should we do with the Othershore Flower? The Flower Burial Sword has become stronger, but it’s still lacking from reaching a Fourspirit Glory Saint Artifact.”

“Let me think…” Lil’ Purple fell into deep thoughts as she looked at the Othershore Flower. The Othershore Flower was happy initially, but it began to tremble after hearing their conversation.

“How about this? You let it transform once into the genuine Othershore Flower. At that time, you can get it to give you its spiritual liquid. I heard that it produces the most aromatic fragrance in the world, also known as the Mandala Fragrance,” Lil’ Purple said. “The Ying River King has a way to ripen the Othershore Flower, but I can let it transform with my own means. It’s not a bad opportunity; it can stay here to produce Mandala Fragrance. At that time, you won’t have to worry about upgrading your sword in the future.”

Lin Yun exclaimed, “Wow! Great!”

He only considered letting it grow before harvesting it, but Lil’ Purple devised a cycle that will allow the Flower Burial Sword to become a Sovereign Saint Artifact.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“But this method requires it to cooperate,” Lil’ Purple pointed at the Othershore Flower.

“Will it agree?” Lin Yun asked.

Lil’ Purple grinned, “You possess the Azure Dragon Divine Physique. If you use your divine physique to nurture this Othershore Flower, it will be a great opportunity for it. Let me converse with it.”

When Lil’ Purple came before the Thershore Flower, she touched it and began conversing with it. A brief moment later, she smiled, “It’s a success.”

Lin Yun moved in accordance to Lil’ Purple’s instructions and came before the Othershore Flower before he sat down with his sword stabbed into the ground beside him. He then asked, “What should I do?”

“Nothing. You just have to cultivate and comprehend Saint Dao while it draws from you. Remember not to be stingy with the Divine Dragon Saint Liquid.” Lil’ Purple went to the side to draw spiritual runes, and a complicated spiritual array soon appeared where Lin Yun sat.

As a powerful gale rose, Lil’ Purple soared to the sky with the two Sovereign Divine Runes activated.

Lin Yun swallowed 50 kilograms of Divine Dragon Saint Liquid and circulated the Great Profound Sword Canon and Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon. As his strength increased, the Othershore Flower’s branches were like tentacles coiling around Lin Yun and stabbing into his flesh.

The Othershore Flower began to absorb Lin Yun’s vitality as it gave off a dazzling radiance. At the same time, the Flower Burial Sword was also absorbing the fragrance coming from it.

Lin Yun was soon shocked to discover that the Othershore Flower didn’t just devour his vitality but would give him extremely pure energy in return. This was the Othershore Flower’s excess energy, but it benefited Lin Yun’s cultivation since it was comparable to the saint energy in the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda.

This feels magical. The Ying River King must’ve known of this effect. That’s why he stole the Othershore Flower, right? Lin Yun was amazed in his heart, but he didn’t have the luxury to think much now. It was about time for him to make a breakthrough, taking this opportunity to reach the Saint Soul Stage.

The Heavenly Origin Phase was divided into the Sacred Flame, Saint Soul, and Saint Constellation phases. By combining the three, one would reach the Saint Realm.

His strength might’ve improved from his training on the Blood Purgatory Mountain, but he didn’t make any breakthroughs in his cultivation. So, he planned to increase his cultivation on the God Burial Mountain Range. He didn’t want to stay at the Heavenly Origin Phase for too long. He aimed to reach the Saint Constellation Stage before leaving the God Burial Mountain Range, to fully unlock the Heaven Burial Constellation.

Ten days later, Lin Yun finished refining the 50 kilograms of Divine Dragon Saint Liquid and his cultivation had reached the second stage of the Heavenly Origin Phase, the Saint Soul Stage. After condensing his saint soul, Lin Yun felt that his mental energy had increased. Furthermore, he rejoiced since the saint aura in his violent palace had formed into a sea with his saint aura being further compressed. His saint aura was still saint aura, but it was no longer inferior to saint energy in terms of quality.

“It should be easier for me to use the Buddhist Emperor Golden Lotus Spear now, but I wonder how powerful it is.” Lin Yun opened his eyes and felt himself filled with incredible power.

“Mhm?” Lin Yun looked around, but couldn’t see the Othershore Flower anywhere. He asked, “Where’s the Othershore Flower?”

Lil’ Purple descended from the Phoenix Tree and smiled, “You’re too slow. The Othershore Flower transformed three days ago. Look down.”

When Lin Yun looked down, he saw a red flower the size of a palm ten meters away. There were also withered leaves and stems on the ground.

After transforming, the mist released by the Othershore Flower looked dreamy, and voices could be heard. If one looked at it for too long, it would make them feel like they were dreaming.

“How magical.” Lin Yun looked at it and had to use his Quasi-Divine Light Sword Intent to resist the illusion from the Othershore Flower. His instincts told him that this Othershore Flower wasn’t simple.

“Alright, it should be time for it to produce fragrance now.” Lil’ Purple wasn’t polite and took out a bottle before approaching the Othershore Flower.

The Othershore Flower felt aggrieved, but it still released a radiance as a few droplets of dew dropped down that emitted a fragrance.

The fragrance made Lin Yun feel his mind becoming clear, and his saint soul nearly flew out of his body. He was shocked and had to use his willpower to control himself. He then said with lingering fear, “Holy shit. That’s the Mandala Fragrance that can pull others into a dream… I nearly fell for it.”

He had fallen into the illusion and had to rely on his sword intent to break free. Even if he knew it wasn’t on purpose from the Othershore Flower, this still filled him with lingering fear.

“That little?” Lil’ Purple asked unhappily.

The Othershore Flower was aggrieved as it waved its petals around as though it was saying it had no more left.

“Alright, look at how aggrieved it is,” Lin Yun couldn’t help smiling.

The Othershore Flower seemed to have heard Lin Yun’s words, swaying its petals as if it were expressing gratitude.

“Hmph, it must still have some. Let me try squeezing it.” Lil’ Purple naturally wouldn’t fall for it and she grabbed the Othershore Flower, wanting to pull it out.

This frightened the Othershore Flower into leaving the ground with its root-like feet and hid behind Lin Yun.

Seeing this, Lil’ Purple was unhappy as she smiled, “I’m just bluffing you, so why are you hiding behind him? Don’t you know that his name is Flower Burial?”

But the Othershore Flower shook its head, unwilling to show itself.

“A total of fifteen droplets. It should be enough for the Flower Burial Sword to reach the Fourspirit Glory Saint Artifact,” Lil’ Purple said as she handed the bottle over.

“What did you do to it?” Lin Yun asked.

“Don’t you see that even though it looks pitiful, it wasn’t well-behaved? So I squeezed it a little, and so much Mandala Fragrance came out each time,” Lil’ Purple said.

Lin Yun began to imagine that, and the corner of his lips twitched since it was too ruthless. He began to sympathise with the Othershore Flower now.
