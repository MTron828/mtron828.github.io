Chapter 1462 - Dragon-blooded Demonic Corpse

Three days later, when the Five Peaks Competition was about to officially begin, the entire Sword Sect became more lively than ever before. Almost all the inner disciples had rushed to the Celestial Observing Stage. The stage was on top of a mountain with various patterns engraved on it, and there was a boundless sea of clouds in front of the stage.

Today, the disciples of the Scarlet, Golden, Azure, Indigo, and Divine Firmament Peaks were gathered here. It wasn’t easy to visit the Celestial Observing Stage. It required contribution points. After all, Yu Qingfeng’s sword ray was left behind there.

As one of the two grand events of the Sword Sect, there was no doubt that the Five Peaks Competition would be intense. The streams of people heading over to the Celestial Observing Stage looked like long snakes, making this a spectacular scene.

Many Dragon Pulse Realm disciples had already arrived, but they didn’t have much excitement on their faces. After all, this event no longer had anything to do with them. But this didn’t stop them from coming since the top ten on the Earth Ranking would be there. Most importantly, they were curious about the current celebrity of their sect, Flower Burial Lin Yun.

There wasn’t a single person in the Sword Sect who hadn’t heard of Lin Yun’s name. When the Dragon Pulse Realm disciples returned to the sect, they heard of Lin Yun’s name.

The Divine Firmament Peak’s disciples were gathered together on the Celestial Observing Stage. But Chen Ling had his brows furrowed and looked anxious.

On the other hand, Gongsun Yan, who was standing beside him, didn’t look anxious. Gongsun Yan wasn’t taken in by any saints after joining the Sword Sect. So he joined the Divine Firmament Peak when he heard Lin Yun joined it, it’s just that he had been in seclusion and only came out recently.

“You don’t seem anxious at all?” Chen Ling turned to look at Gongsun Yan.

“Why are you anxious? The Five Peaks Competition is nothing, and that fellow will be able to handle it.” Gongsun Yan replied.

“I’m afraid he’ll miss the time,” Chen Ling replied.

“You don’t have to worry about that. That fellow is always late, and he’s a professional at that. So you can give up hoping that he’ll come early. It’s either he doesn’t come, or he’ll come and give everyone a huge shock.” Gongsun Yan said.

“A huge shock? Don't tell me you think Lin Yun can cause waves during the Five Peaks Competition?” A mocking voice resounded. The owner of this voice was Huangfu Yan. He led several Azure Firmament Peak’s disciples over, looking around as if he was looking for someone. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Ever since his defeat at the hands of Lin Yun, he worked hard and made a breakthrough into the four-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm. He would get someone to inquire about Lin Yun’s movements every day, wanting to take revenge before the Five Peaks Competition. So he was disappointed when he came to the gathering corner of the Divine Firmament Peak’s disciples and couldn’t find Lin Yun anywhere.

“That brat must be in hiding!” Huangfu Yan coldly said when he couldn’t find Lin Yun anywhere.

Gongsun Yan raised his head to look at Huangfu Yan. He might have had small fights with Lin Yun, but this didn’t mean he was happy when he heard Huangfu Yan mocking his friend. He snickered, “He went into hiding? Don’t tell me you think that he’s afraid of you? You’re overthinking it. I’ve never seen anyone who Lin Yun has surpassed manage to make a comeback. So I advise you to drop the idea of taking revenge.”

Chen Ling’s face changed because Gongsun Yan was bold to speak to Huangfu Yan in this manner. Just as he had expected, Huangfu Yan’s face changed and he became furious. But when he saw Feng Luan throwing a glance at him, he could only swallow his words.

“Let us see, then!” Huangfu Yan said, looking at Chen Ling and Gongsun Yan. “He better not show up, or I’ll teach him a lesson! I wonder how much of a laughingstock he’ll become when he can’t make it into the top ten on the Earth Ranking as a heaven direct disciple.”

When he was done, he immediately left and no longer bothered about Gongsun Yan. This made Chen Ling smile. “He’s well-known for his temper. After all, he’s Prince Yan.”

“Why should I be afraid of him? Don’t tell me that he’ll beat me up publically?” Gongsun Yan snickered.

“Don’t be so sure about that.” Chen Ling smiled. “He might teach you a lesson if Senior Brother Feng isn’t around. Just think about how he previously came after Lin Yun.”

“He’s that terrifying?” Gongsun Yan said with lingering fear in his tone. He had just come out of seclusion and didn’t know much about the Sword Sect’s affairs.

“It’s not exactly bad if Lin Yun doesn’t come. He has been in the limelight recently, and he’ll be a public target in the Five Peaks Competition!” Chen Ling sighed.

“How is this possible?” Gongsun Yan was surprised. Those in the top ten on the Earth Ranking were at least at the four-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm. As for the Twin Star of the Earth Ranking, Ji Shuxuan and Jin Xuanyi were at the five-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm.

They also cultivated a ghost spirit sword technique, not to mention that their sword sutras reached the fifth stage. Aside from that, who knew how many trump cards they possessed?

Although Gongsun Yan had just come out of seclusion, he knew a lot about those two. If those two stepped into the Dragon Pulse Realm, there was a high possibility that they would be comparable to those on the Heaven Ranking.

“I hope that I’m just overthinking it.” Chen Ling said without much confidence in his tone. According to what he found out, the top ten of the Earth Ranking planned on targeting Lin Yun. Even Huangfu Yan was sent out to probe Lin Yun’s strength when he previously challenged him.

After all, how could the commotion that was caused when Lin Yun became a heaven direct disciple settle down so easily?

While Chen Ling and Gongsun Yan were talking, Lin Yun had reached the crucial moment of refining the tenth-grade Spiritual Sword Bead.

Beneath a towering tree at the edge of the Withered Mountain Range, Lin Yun was seated with his eyes closed, unleashing his sword intent without any reservations. His sword intent soared into the sky, occasionally manifesting into thundered that rumbled in the sky, with the thundering roars spreading as far as a thousand miles away.

The demonic beasts in the surroundings had already fled when they sensed the danger. So there weren’t any demonic beasts within a thousand mile radius of Lin Yun. At this moment, Lin Yun was the king of this entire region.

As a powerful gale blew over the thunderclouds, they began to wriggle, with the lighting looking like magma, causing a huge rumble as they transformed. Lin Yun’s forehead was covered in sweat, and his face was pale.

Suddenly, the thunderclouds broke free of their restraints and manifested into a dragon, wrapped in the power of wind and lightning. The next moment, the dragon dove down and entered Lin Yun’s body.

When Lin Yun opened his eyes, he shone brightly and released a domineering aura into the surroundings. His firmament sword intent gradually became stronger until he reached complete mastery.

When he was done, Lin Yun let out a breath, and his complexion gradually became rosy. It was a surprise, and the tenth-grade Spiritual Sword Bead was stronger than he had imagined. It had immediately brought his firmament sword intent that was at the lesser mastery to complete mastery.

Then again, this was also connected to the breakthrough of his two sword sutras. The breakthrough of sword intent had a huge connection to his sword sutras. The breakthrough of the two sword sutras gave him enlightenment in Sword Dao. So the tenth-grade Spiritual Sword Bead merely acted as a catalyst to unlock that enlightenment.

Right then, a cold gaze was fixed on Lin Yun from a thousand miles away. The gaze was from the four-star Heavenly Elysium Core Realm monarch demonic beast, the Demon Rune Tiger. After devouring the corpses of those two monarch demonic beasts, it had undergone a significant boost in strength and placed its eyes on Lin Yun.

But it was hesitating and didn’t dare to step forth. On the other hand, Lin Yun was looking forward to fighting the Demon Rune Tiger since comprehension in a life and death battle would aid his breakthrough more smoothly. But it was a pity that the Demon Rune Tiger was intelligent and didn’t want to take the risk.

“Well, I can come to you if you don’t come to me!” Lin Yun smiled. He remembered how his arm had nearly shattered when he previously clashed with the Demon Rune Tiger. Now that his firmament sword intent had reached complete mastery, there was no reason for him to not take revenge.

When the Golden Crow Wings unfolded behind him, Lin Yun shone brightly like a sun before he appeared in front of the Demon Rune Tiger. This surprised the Demon Rune Tiger before it roared, “You’re coming to me when I’m not coming to you? Are you here to court death?”

“Ha!” Lin Yun laughed. When his dual sword souls were simultaneously released, he unleashed his firmament sword intent without any reservations. A series of explosions came from trees within a hundred miles and were turned to dust, turning this entire region into a barren land.

When the Demon Rune Tiger raised its head, its jaw nearly fell off because the sky was moving. The sky was descending along with a boundless sword aura, and it didn’t take long for it to be only a thousand meters away.

Before the Demon Rune Tiger could react, the sea of clouds descended, causing it to bleed from its seven orifices as it took on a humanoid form with its legs shaking.

But Lin Yun merely hovered in the air with the sea of clouds just above his head. It looked as though he could touch the clouds as long as he stretched his hand out. At this moment, Lin Yun was like a domineering monarch, granting lives to those who submitted and death to those who went against him.

When Lin Yun swept his gaze over, a majestic aura was imposed on the Demon Rune Tiger, causing it to fall to one knee and throwing out a mouthful of blood.

“Tiger, are you willing to submit to me?” Lin Yun smiled with his eyes squinted. This Demon Rune Tiger knew the cultivation technique of the demon clan, and it wasn’t a bad choice for him to subdue it if possible.

“You want this king to submit to you? Dream on!” The Demon Rune Tiger had never suffered such humiliation before, and forced itself to stand back up. When it stood up, it dashed forth and threw its palm at Lin Yun.

“Heaven Sword Form!” Lin Yun smiled before he pushed his palm forth. After his firmament sword intent reached complete mastery, he had a whole new comprehension of the Heaven Sword Form. When he opened his palm, thirty-six afterimages appeared, with all of them wielding a sword.

Their swords were like brushes, and it didn’t take long for an ancient ‘heaven’ word to appear behind Lin Yun. When Lin Yun pushed his palm out, the Demon Rune Tiger was sent a thousand meters away before colliding with the ground, creating a huge crater. When the Demon Rune Tiger jumped out of the crater, it didn’t hesitate to run for its life.

“It’s pretty fast at running away.” Lin Yun muttered. He didn’t choose to chase after the Demon Rune Tiger because he didn’t forget what day today was. When he lowered his head to look at his palm, he saw that the thirty-six strokes were like dragons wandering around his palm. As he clenched his fist, those strokes dissipated.

“Time to leave. Otherwise, I would slowly play with that tiger…” Lin Yun smiled and closed his eyes to recall his firmament sword intent and stored it within his Golden Crow Wings. After being injected with the firmament sword intent, every feather of the Golden Crow Wings shone brightly. Once he finished pouring his firmament sword intent into them, he flapped his wings and shot out like an arrow, heading towards the Sword Sect.
