Chapter 2397 - A Smile

Lin Yun’s calm voice shocked everyone. His arrogance took them aback because the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son was more famous than the chief disciple of the Heavenly Saint Courtyard. Not only was Heavenly Qilin Divine Son the champion of the third testing ground, but he even had the Qilin Mountain’s deity behind him, possessing an unimaginable status back on Qilin Mountain.

Even within the three thousand realms, there weren’t many geniuses like him. Not to mention that he was a pinnacle Saint Lord who grasped one of the Eternal Daos—Space Dao. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

On the other hand, Lin Yun was only an eighth-stage Saint Lord, and no one felt he could fight the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son even if he had defeated Bai Ye. In terms of talent and cultivation, there was a massive gap between them.

When a breeze blew, the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son appeared on the Heavenly Barren Divine Stage, hovering in the air. He was handsome and wore an indifferent smile on his lips. He said, “You want to grant me a defeat? You’re really arrogant, but it’s time to resolve the grudge between us. I’ll show everyone you’re only worthy of becoming my servant, and the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Maiden chose the wrong person!”

The Heavenly Qilin Divine Son’s words caused an uproar. He didn’t bother hiding his feelings for the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Maiden.

Lin Yun smiled, “It looks like you’re pretty confident.”

“You won’t smile in a while!” The Heavenly Qilin Divine Son descended with a constellation opening up behind him. His constellation was an azure tree, and this was the constellation unique to Qilin Mountain. The tree looked realistic with life force flowing around it, and it could be comparable to a Sovereign Constellation if pushed to the limit.

Lin Yun stood a hundred meters away, and a Kunpeng Painting opened up behind him. When the Kunpeng soared to the sky, Lin Yun’s temperament changed as he gave off a powerful aura while wielding his Flower Burial Sword. There was no comparison in the past, but many women noticed that even the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son couldn’t be compared to Lin Yun's appearance.

“Kunpeng Constellation? Interesting...” The Heavenly Qilin Divine Son’s face became grave when he saw the Kunpeng that flew out. He shook his right hand and slapped through the air, “But this much isn’t enough!”

This was a gentle move, but it gave off a powerful explosion as lightning enveloped the entire Heavenly Barren Divine Stage, charging at Lin Yun.

Lin Yun wore a grave expression and shook his wrist, spinning the Flower Burial Sword around. Lightning also exploded from him as they fought through the air. One waved the sword, relying on the Azure Dragon to control thunderstorms, while the other formed a seal and used the azure tree to summon thunderclouds.

As lightning enveloped the Heavenly Barren Divine Stage, the lightning soon accumulated to a terrifying height, which was scary. No one could have imagined this was something created merely using Thunder Dao.

“They’re really powerful. They’re not famous for Thunder Dao, but they can control it freely.”

“The Heavenly Qilin Divine Son probably wanted to humiliate Lin Yun, but he didn’t expect Lin Yun to also play along with him.”

“If either of them lost in Thunder Dao, it would be embarrassing.” Many people soon noticed what was going on and became excited. When the Qilin Mountain’s experts saw this scene, they confidently sneered.

The Heavenly Qilin Divine Son’s attainment in Thunder Dao far exceeded everyone’s imagination, and it wasn’t an underestimation to call it a trump card. As the azure tree grew, crimson lightning formed into spears that descended from the sky. At the far end of the spears was a majestic figure, which looked like a deity tossing spears at Lin Yun.

At the same time, lightning began to spread on the ground as they were given life for a short moment by the azure tree.

Lin Yun had no change on his face and continued to swing his sword. As sword rays flew, the Flower Burial Sword spiraled, leaving behind a sword vibration that sounded like zither music. He poured his sword intent into the Azure Dragon Dao, creating a terrifying phenomenon as an Azure Dragon flew out from his body.

He controlled the Azure Dragon to manipulate thunderstorms, facing the deity in the sky as they clashed, leaving behind terrifying cracks in the sky. They couldn’t imagine how terrifying the crimson spears were.

“It really seemed like the power of a deity!”

“Have you forgotten that the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son’s father is a powerful deity?” Everyone was shocked that Lin Yun actually managed to withstand the attacks from the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son, who borrowed a deity’s power.

When a sword vibration echoed, moonlight shone on Lin Yun as he fearlessly faced the deity’s aura.

“What a powerful sword vibration!” Everyone was shocked by the resounding sword vibration with their hearts trembling. It was unbelievable that Lin Yun relied on his mortal body to fight a deity, which was how a true swordsman should be. Even if his bloodline couldn’t be compared to the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son, his heart for the sword was fearless.

The Heavenly Qilin Divine Son frowned because he was a Quasi-Saint Sovereign, and he could suppress an eighth-stage Saint Lord with a flick of his finger. He thought he could suppress Lin Yun quickly, but he didn’t expect it to be so troublesome and failed to suppress Lin Yun even after using his bloodline talent.

The Heavenly Qilin Divine Son began to form seals beneath the azure tree, and the tree trembled as it released more power.

Lin Yun was calm as he recalled his talk with his master. His master didn’t want to become an Emperor so easily, but he wanted to become one comparable with the Nine Emperors. This should be how the Sword Sect’s swordsmen should be.

As the Flower Burial Sword began to vibrate, the vibration started to echo, stopping the crimson spears from descending. Lin Yun had many ways to deal with this situation, but he wanted to play along with the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son since the latter wanted to play. As an azure dragon’s roar echoed, the crimson spears were pushed even higher.

“How dare you!” The Heavenly Qilin Divine Son was furious as his hands trembled. Lightning exploded in the surroundings as he disappeared. When he reappeared, he was already above Lin Yun and merged with the deity figure, grabbing onto the crimson spear himself.

This time, the aura he gave off was different, as the crimson spear left a hole in the Azure Dragon’s head. The sword vibration was restricted before the azure dragon exploded. When everything settled down on the stage, a crimson spear appeared where Lin Yun previously stood, the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son hovering behind the spear with his clothes fluttering. He might look dashing, but his face was ugly.

On the other hand, Lin Yun took ten steps back with blood dripping from his lips and wore a bright smile even though the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son obtained the advantage in this exchange. But the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son had revealed his cultivation as a Quasi-Saint Sovereign and even used his Space Dao. This meant that the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son had lost in a competition between Thunder Dao.

“You’re impressive since you can force me to this step, but it is over now!” The Heavenly Qilin Divine Son stood with one hand behind him and raised his right hand with a dao flower appearing behind him. It was one of the nine Eternal Daos—Space Dao.

Everyone knew that Space Dao was the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son’s trump card, and he hardly had an opponent upon using it because he could put a long distance between himself and his opponent in the next second. Even if his opponent had the same cultivation as him, his opponent could only be suppressed by Space Dao.

Everyone found it a pity since Lin Yun had already brought his sword intent to the limit as an eighth-stage Saint Lord, but it was futile before Space Dao. But that was how powerful an Eternal Dao was.

Right then, Lin Yun smiled, and he looked at the Heavenly Qilin Divine Son while raising his left hand, “An Eternal Dao? What a coincidence because I have also grasped one!”

A black and white dao flower appeared behind Lin Yun. It was one of the nine Eternal Daos—Yin-Yang Dao!

The entire Heavenly Saint Courtyard was briefly shocked before a commotion broke out with disbelief on everyone’s faces.

The Heavenly Qilin Divine Son grasped Space Dao, but Lin Yun grasped Yin-Yang Dao!

This was an unprecedented scene, leaving everyone shocked.

On the stage, an azure-clothed figure wore a confident smile.
