Chapter 1291 - Mysterious Underground Palace

In a serene valley located in the Profound Wither Island, this place was filled with spiritual energy. At the depths of the valley was a saint elixir that released a majestic phenomenon, unleashing countless aurora lights.

Bai Luli, who fled from Lin Yun, was refining the saint elixir here, and his pale complexion was swiftly improving. This was a saint elixir, but the fact that it couldn’t allow him to instantly recover from his injuries proved how gravely injured he was.

Right at that moment, a scarlet-clothed elder arrived before Bai Luli, along with several Flame Dragon Sect deacons. When Bai Luli opened his eyes, a cold light flashed across his pupils while he gritted his teeth. “Have you guys found Lin Yun?”

The scarlet-clothed elder was emitting a terrifying aura in the Greater Elysium Core Realm. The aura around him was as deep and unfathomable as flames and magma, making him look like a flaming jiao-dragon in the magma.

The deacons were all at the Lesser Elysium Core Realm, and even if they were added together, their auras couldn’t be compared to the elder.

“The Ancient Spiritual Lake has been destroyed. It’s now a forbidden land and many people have died there,” said the scarlet-clothed elder.

“Perhaps Lin Yun also died there. He probably had no idea how terrifying that ancient corpse at the bottom of the lake was,” said a deacon. They felt that there was a high chance that Lin Yun had lost his life over there.

“That’s impossible!” Bai Luli retorted in an agitated tone. “There’s no way he’d die there. You guys didn’t face him, so you have no idea how terrifying his physique is. There’s no way he’d die there!”

He was repeating this again and again with a sinister expression, and everyone could tell that his emotions weren’t right. This instantly made the deacons silent because they were afraid of the current Bai Luli.

“He should still be alive. He might seem arrogant, but he’s also cautious at the same time. Otherwise, there’s no way he’d be able to survive till now.” Bai Luli continued. At this moment, he had calmed down a lot, and his judgment of Lin Yun was a lot more objective.

“The Profound Wither Island is huge. If he’s not here for the great saint origin, it’s practically impossible for us to find him,” said the scarlet-clothed elder.

“Impossible to find?” Bai Luli’s expression became distorted, and he continued, “I have a way to force him out. He came here together with the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, right? Contact the other big sects. I believe that they will be interested in his head.”

Although the eight Samsara Edict Realm experts have apologized to Feng Jue, that was only because they had violated the rules in the first place. But on the Profound Wither Island, there weren’t any rules to follow. Some big sects might take it lying down, but there would also be those who couldn’t accept it. So if he was willing to take the first step out, he believed that those people would be willing to help out.

“A…Are you sure you want to do that?” A deacon asked in an uneasy tone. He was afraid that they would thoroughly offend Feng Jue in this manner and bring trouble to their sect.

“I am,” said Bai Luli while he grounded his teeth. When he was done, he suddenly asked, “Where’s Dugu Yan? I want to see him.”

Within the Chief Disciples of the big sects, Dugu Yan was the strongest amongst them and was even rumored to be invincible in the sword who could compete with the transcendent geniuses from the eight strongest sects. If Dugu Yan was willing to help, Lin Yun would definitely be dead. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Under Lil’ Purple’s directions, Lin Yun pushed his speed to the limit and turned into a golden light streaking across the horizon. But all of a sudden, Lin Yun threw out a mouthful of blood.

“Aren’t you pushing yourself a little too much? You’ve yet to manifest your constellation and you want to confront transcendent Elysium Core Realm experts? If your Azure Dragon Saint Physique hadn’t undergone that transformation, you’d be heavily crippled, even if you’re not dead!” Lil’ Purple helplessly said when she saw Lin Yun’s current state.

Lin Yun might seem strong when he faced the Flame Dragon Sect and had recovered to his top state at the Ancient Spiritual Lake, but he still suffered hidden injuries. It was actually a piece of good news for him to throw out a mouthful of blood. This meant that the hidden injuries in his body have been removed.

“There are times where I don’t have a choice, not to mention that I also didn’t suffer any loss…” Lin Yun smiled while he wiped the blood off his lips with fighting spirit blazing in his pupils.

“Why are you trying so hard?” Lil’ Purple asked.

“I-I only wish to fulfill the promise I made, one day,” said Lin Yun seriously after a brief stun. Then, he continued with a smile, “I also wish to protect those I care about. You’re so adorable, and who knows when you’ll be kidnapped if I’m not strong enough. Also, Lil’ Red is very playful, so how can I protect you guys without sufficient strength? If I don’t give it my all, how can I call myself someone with the heart of a swordsman?”

When Lil’ Purple heard what Lin Yun said, her face blushed red before she proudly said, “Hmph, this empress doesn’t need your protection. You’re just this empress’ servant!”

“Hahaha!” Lin Yun laughed when he heard that, but he didn’t refute her words. Spreading his arms apart, he turned into a golden light streaking across the sky. Without him knowing it, he had already reached the depths of the island, and he had to admit that the size of the Profound Wither Island was a little ridiculous.

What Lil’ Purple said was right. It wasn’t because he was unfortunate, but the island was just too big. Without accurate information, it would be the same as finding a needle in a haystack. If he wasn’t lucky enough to run into the Flame Dragon Sect, he might still be empty-handed right now.

Two days later, Lin Yun appeared at an ancient ruin. The size of this ruin was shocking, and he could see the majestic constructs that filled his vision, stretching to the far end of the horizon. In front of such a ruin, the power of an individual was as tiny as an ant.

“This Profound Wither Island…is equivalent to a nation.” Lin Yun sighed and muttered, “I wonder where the great saint origin is…”

“Don’t think about the great saint origin first. If you don’t manifest your constellation, you’ll be lucky enough to keep your life.” Lil’ Purple played with her braids and continued, “Let’s go to the place I previously told you about. That is a rather complete underground palace, and I can sense a terrifying fluctuation coming from it. There might be a corpse of a Samsara Edict Realm expert there!”

“Alright.” Lin Yun naturally trusted Lil’ Purple’s instincts. After all, there was no need for her to lie, and it was also natural for her to have keen senses as a divine bird who lived through ancient times.

“Follow me.” Lil’ Purple landed on a mountain. When Lin Yun landed on the mountain, countless gazes were immediately directed at him. This mountain was rather striking in this ruin, and anyone who landed here naturally attracted everyone’s attention.

“This person is terrifying!”

“He’s clearly only at the Galaxy Stage, but I actually feel a threat coming from him?”

“Isn’t he the person who killed the geniuses from the eight big sects before?” Everyone who was searching for treasure here was undoubtedly an expert, and there were also some who recognized Lin Yun. But no matter what, they were cautious of him and treated him as a fellow competitor.

“They’re different…” Lin Yun muttered to himself, sensing the surrounding gazes. He could feel that these people were a lot stronger and more cautious. But they were busy looking for their opportunities and paid no attention to Lin Yun.

After all, this was the Profound Wither Island and there was no lack of experts here, not to mention that there were more than ten transcendent geniuses.

Then again, it was a piece of good news to Lin Yun that there was no one to disturb him. He retracted his aura and got Lil’ Purple to guide him from the sword box while he carried on with his journey while keeping his aura contained.

An hour later, Lin Yun stopped before a tunnel heading down to the underground palace. There were many powerful saint rune fragments at the entrance, and there were even some collapsed tablets that were cleaned out.

The stone tablets had ancient runes on them, and Lin Yun could guess that they must be used to seal this entrance.

“Someone came here!” Lin Yun was first alarmed before she soon calmed down. If the power sects truly had a map in their hands, it was only a matter of time for them to find this place. At the same time, this also meant that what Lil’ Purple said was true.

He could also see many different footprints on the ground and this meant that there was more than one group of people who came.

“Lin Yun, what should we do now? There’s a high chance that those who can find this place are disciples of the powerful sects.” Lil’ Purple analyzed.

“I naturally have to compete, no matter what!” Lin Yun’s eyes flashed with resolution. He was in a hurry to manifest his constellation, so he was determined to compete. If needed, he would even reveal his firmament sword intent without hesitation. After all, the transcendent geniuses have already started to refine origin saint runes, and he didn’t have much time left.

“I share the same thoughts,” Lil’ Purple said. No matter who made it first, she was the first person who found this place, so they naturally have to compete. Standing on Lin Yun’s shoulder, Lil’ Red also began to rub its claws together.

“Let’s go.” Lin Yun naturally wouldn’t give up and entered the entrance. Not long later, his vision became dark and the underground palace was practically a maze. But fortunately, his sword intent was strong enough that he wouldn’t lose his direction in the maze.
