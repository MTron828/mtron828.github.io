Chapter 884 - Change of Mind!

The massive statue looked like a divine dragon roaring at the sky. Lin Yun was deeply shocked because his Azure Dragon Enneaform could manifest the azure dragon’s aura, but it was like a drop in the ocean compared to this statue.

On top of that, his sword intent retracted back into his body like a sword that was firmly sheathed. At this moment, he felt like a child in front of the statue.

Before the statue were geniuses from various realms who were praying. They merely bowed in front of the statue and cupped their hands together to show their devotion. When they opened their eyes, an azure dragon plaque would be floating in front of them. They didn’t even need to mark it with their blood essence since it was already marked during the prayer.

It might seem mysterious, but the Sacred Alliance had already gathered all of their information before the banquet. So it wasn’t surprising that the plaque would already have their information.

As Fang Shaoyu, Zhao Chen, and Zhu Qingshan looked around, they could sense many powerful auras in the surroundings. They could sense a terrifying aura coming from the geniuses with the qualification for the Heavenly Soul Realm tribulation. Their existences were like bright stars shining in the sky.

The pinnacle of the Heavenly Soul Realm was in reference to the pinnacle before reaching the first soul. Fang Shaoyu and the others could tell that they were outclassed with all the pinnacle experts.

There was no question that the astral energy closest to the statue was the densest and anyone who could occupy those spots would be able to refine astral pellets faster than others. The astral pellets could also be used to purchase various treasures that were found in the ruins around the city. Not all treasures were compatible with the person who found them, so the market was rife with sellers.

Under this situation, the places closest to the statue became precious. If you weren’t hardworking enough and only wanted to set up a store, you could do it after paying a certain sum of astral pellets. But clearly, the best places were all occupied by those geniuses with the qualification of tribulation.

Lin Yun’s eyes flickered because he was looking at the Heavenly Soul Realm geniuses. He could keenly sense that they were in the first soul of the Heavenly Soul Realm. Evidently, there were a few people who made it through the tribulation.

Everyone who entered the Heavenly Path was a genius in their respective realm. They could have just cultivated in their own realms, but they chose to come to the Heavenly Path to overcome the tribulation. At the very least, they needed to have that qualification or else their journey to the Heavenly Path would have been a waste.

Lin Yun counted for experts in the first soul. He could sense the pressure coming from the four of them and the boundless origin energy from their aura oceans. The seven souls in the Heavenly Soul Realm corresponded to the seven orifices in the Xiantian Realm. Each soul could unlock an ocean that would increase the limits of their abilities.

With each soul, the strength of the cultivators would tremendously change.

“Lin Yun, look!” Fang Shaoyu’s face changed right at this moment.

“Don’t look,” said Lin Yun. He knew that Fang Shaoyu had noticed cultivators from the Flamecloud Realm. The leader of the group emitted a powerful aura that reached the tribulation stage and shined like a bright sun among the crowd. There was no doubt that he was Feng Xuan of the Flamecloud Realm.

Many geniuses gathered around Feng Xuan as the Flamecloud Realm had staked a territory in the plaza. Fang Shaoyu, Zhao Chen, and Zhu Qingshan’s intel was spot on. It looks like Feng Xuan really did have a position in Thunderflame City.

Lin Yun didn’t want to deal with Feng Xuan for now because he wasn’t sure if the latter was friends with first soul Heavenly Soul Realm experts. But if Feng Xuan came to him, he wouldn’t back down.

Fang Shaoyu finally calmed down after seeing Lin Yun’s reaction. It didn’t take long for them to obtain their dragon plaques, which officially started their journey in the Heavenly Path.

Lin Yun could easily summon the azure plaque after it fused with his body. With a single thought, it would appear.

Fang Shaoyu had also obtained the dragon plaque and smiled, “Lin Yun, this place is no different from a market. There might be fortune martial techniques here. Are we going to try our luck here?”

Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts because he saw people selling fortune martial techniques here. Unfortunately, most of them were martial techniques and not cultivation techniques. Even an intermediate fortune cultivation technique was rare, not to mention a greater fortune cultivation technique. After all, it was something that everyone lacked and no one would take it out to sell.

But it wouldn’t matter if they spent time looking for suitable fortune martial techniques for Fang Shaoyu, Zhao Chen, and Zhu Qingshan. Right at this moment, a figure suddenly soared into the sky with flames exploding from his body. Under the immense pressure, the entire plaza became quiet for a brief moment.

“Is that Feng Xuan?”

“What is he trying to do…” Feng Xuan had some fame in Thunderflame City. So the moment he soared into the sky, he instantly attracted many people’s attention.

“Killing those from my Flamecloud Realm and snatching 100,000 astral pellets that belong to me. You guys are really bold to show up before me!” Feng Xuan said with a dark face.

“I see. I heard that a stronghold that belonged to the Flamecloud Realm was brought down.”

“I heard that it was done by someone from the lower realm called the Profound Amber Realm. The name of that person seems to be Lin Yun.”

“Interesting. Feng Xuan isn’t a pushover. I can’t believe someone actually dared to rob his stronghold and appear in Thunderflame City. They’re practically ignoring Feng Xuan’s existence. No wonder he is so enraged…”

“But where’s that brat?” An uproar broke out in the plaza as everyone started to look for Lin Yun.

Without any hesitation, Feng Xuan pushed out his palm and unleashed a blazing heatwave that sent many people flying. Facing Feng Xuan’s attack, Lin Yun took a step forward as his origin energy fluctuated on the surface of his body.

He was fine after receiving the attack head-on, but his mask wasn’t. His mask suddenly cracked into pieces and fell, which revealed his appearance to everyone.

Everyone’s first impression of Lin Yun was that he was extremely young. Lin Yun looked to be no older than eighteen or nineteen. It seemed unbelievable that he managed to destroy one of the Flamecloud Realm’s strongholds since his cultivation was only in the quasi-Heavenly Soul Realm. Clearly, Lin Yun was talented. However, it was a pity that Lin Yun was discovered because Feng Xuan’s strength was only inferior to first soul experts.

“You think you can hide from everyone by wearing a mask? You must be naive to think that you left no traces of killing those from my Flamecloud Realm.” Feng Xuan’s pupils were filled with arrogance when he looked at Lin Yun.

“You’re overthinking things. I was wearing a mask because I didn’t have any interest in your head for the time being. But don’t for a second think that I’m afraid of you,” said Lin Yun while he sneered inwardly. It would have been different if Feng Xuan had reached the first soul.

However, Feng Xuan had only obtained the qualification to undergo the tribulation. Where did Feng Xuan get his arrogance from?

Everyone was shocked by Lin Yun’s arrogance. Even the first soul Heavenly Soul Realm experts looked over with interest.

Feng Xuan was briefly stunned when he heard Lin Yun’s words before he sneered, “What ignorance. If you’re thinking about enraging me so that I can give you a quick death, then you must be dreaming. I won’t let you die so easily!”

Suddenly, Feng Xuan disappeared. Terrifying flames enveloped the area, causing the temperature to rise quickly.

“What powerful flames!”

“His second grade flame intent must’ve reached lesser mastery. His martial intent alone has surpassed many people.”

“That brat is finished. He probably won’t even be able to take a single move from Feng Xuan.” Everyone in the surroundings exclaimed as they looked at Lin Yun in pity.

In the next second, Feng Xuan appeared before Lin Yun. With a huge collision, flames and azure sword rays intertwined and dazzled many people. After several collisions, a figure was sent flying through the air like a cannonball.

“What speed!” Feng Xuan was truly strong since he could send Lin Yun flying after a single clash. Those who had a grudge with Feng Xuan were genuinely shocked at this moment.

But when everyone saw the figure on the ground, their souls were stirred. The one lying on the ground was actually Feng Xuan! This sequence of events had exceeded everyone’s expectations.

“I changed my mind. Since you come knocking on my door, I’ll take your head now!” A cold voice sounded out as Lin Yun slowly walked out of the flames.
