Chapter 2057 - Feng Shengling

Ouyang Heng trembled in fear and finally stopped moving. He didn’t even dare to raise his head, and this scene left everyone dumbfounded. At the palace, a few people beside Feng Shaoyu slightly opened their mouths and were speechless.

That was especially the case for Zhao Wuji. He held onto the railing, leaving his handprints on it. The Snowfrost Saint Palace’s Gu Zijing, Myriad Sword Pavilion’s Jiang Yunting, and Hidden Sword Manor’s Feng Shengling couldn’t help turning to look at Ye Qingtian.

“I lost!” Ouyang Heng said in a helpless tone with great difficulty.

“Yeah,” Lin Yun nodded and retrieved his sword. He said, “You can go down now.”

Ouyang Heng left in low spirits. Just a moment ago, he was a genius who had obtained ten consecutive victories and shone brightly. But in just a few minutes, Ouyang Heng was kneeling, admitting defeat.

The observation stand was also quiet. They all felt terrible, not because of Ouyang Heng’s loss but due to Ye Qingtian’s attitude. Ye Qingtian’s attitude was like waving his hand to send a fly away. He didn’t say anything arrogant, making everyone feel terrible and grievous.

“Ye Qingtian, I’m here to face you!” A figure flew out amidst the silence. This person was the Myriad Sword Pavilion’s Zhang Feng. He had a strong stance and landed on the lake with his sword intent creating nine geysers.

This feat alone was impressive because the lake was spiritual sacred goldwater. It was considered metal liquid or liquid saint artifact. It was practically impossible for others to leave a ripple on the lake, not to mention creating geysers, and Zhang Feng did this to provoke Ye Qingtian.

“Don’t treat me like the trash from the Black Plume Palace. My Myriad Sword Pavilion is a sword dao holy land of the Southern Border!” Zhang Feng gave off a powerful aura and arrogance. His hair wildly began to flutter with his handsome look. His resounding voice made everyone’s blood boil and excited.

The Myriad Sword Pavilion was proficient in manipulating swords, and they could manipulate multiple saint swords. They could control swords to gang up on their opponents or use swords to form an array.

When Zhang Feng clasped his hands together, eighteen myriad-rune saint swords appeared behind him, each containing a powerful sword aura. As Zhang Feng grinned, he began forming seals, and the eighteen saint swords began to revolve. He said, “Ye Qingtian, watch properly!”

Hundreds to thousands of swords appeared in the blink of an eye, forming a massive sword array. The sword aura radiating from Zhang Feng grew stronger, enveloping the lake. But when he put his hands together, a vibrating noise came from the swords before countless sword auras gathered onto him. At this moment, his Quasi-Astral Sword Intent broke through the bottleneck and reached a height comparable to the Astral Sword Intent.

“Ye Qingtian, do you dare to take my sword?” Zhang Feng laughed and pushed his palm forth. Accompanied by a sword vibration, a sword ray hovering above his palm dashed forth. This was terrifying as starlight even shone on Zhang Feng’s forehead.

“Astral Sword Intent!”

“That’s the Myriad Sword Pavilion’s secret technique, Ethereal Myriad Swords!”

“He even brought out his Astral Sword Intent. It looks like Ye Qingtian is finished!”

“Kill him!” Everyone became insane, with excitement flashing in their pupils. The brief silence was ruined by a commotion from the observation stand.

Lin Yun could tell it wasn’t the genuine Astral Sword Intent, it was just a bluff. A fake was ultimately a fake, and Lin Yun easily found the flaw without using his Sword Heart. He raised his palm and pushed forth, easily shattering the massive sword array. The swords were destroyed, leaving behind the eighteen real saint swords trembling in the air, and this made Zhang Feng barely hold his position.

“What’s going on? Are my swords afraid? H-How is this possible?!” Zhang Feng couldn’t comprehend this and raised his head to look at Ye Qingtian with disbelief.

A mocking smile rose on Ye Qingtian’s lips, before lightly shaking his head. His laughter was like an arrow piercing Zhang Feng’s heart. Ye Qingtian’s sleeves flew apart like clouds as he waved his hand, and his sword aura was like a blooming peony. The moment the flower bloomed, he looked like a monarch who subdued all the swords.

This made Zhang Feng throw out a mouthful of blood and was sent flying away. Zhang Feng lost control of the eighteen saint swords and fell into the lake. When the swords fell into the lake, they didn’t take long to melt.

“This…” Zhang Feng’s words continued to echo about as he died. Naturally everyone who saw this had disbelief on their faces because this happened too quickly. They didn’t know what expression to wear.

“Ye Qingtian, don’t push it!” Someone broke the silence. This person also achieved nine consecutive victories, He was Nangong He from the Snowfrost Saint Palace. While being furious, he soared into the sky.

“Get lost!” Lin Yun roared and circulated his Divine Firmament Sword Sutra. As thousands of black Netherflowers bloomed on the lake, Lin Yun waved his hand and unleashed a sword ray.

Before Nangong He even landed on the lake, a hole appeared in his chest that had blood gushing out, and he was sent flying away. This scene shocked everyone because Ye Qingtian defeated the three with one move.

Seeing this, the young manor master, Feng Shaoyu, anxiously said, “Hasn’t the Eastern Desolation’s sword dao declined?”

Gu Zijing smiled, “Young Manor Master might not know, but Ye Qingtian is the strongest genius swordsman within the Heavenly Dao Sect within the past five hundred years. There are also rumors that he has grasped the Astral Sword Intent, which might be true.”

Feng Shaoyu was stumped when he heard that. Ye Qingtian has also grasped the Astral Sword Intent?

Feng Shengling said, “That fellow might not be the second Jian Jingtian, but not many beneath the Quasi-Saint Realm can do anything to him. It’s impossible to defeat him without grasping the Astral Sword Intent.”

Those words made Feng Shaoyu frown because he was already at the Quasi-Saint Realm, which meant he couldn’t make a move. He said, “What should we do now? If he really became first, the Sword Alliance will be greatly humiliated.”

“Young Manor Master, you don’t have to worry about that. Shengling is a genius of the Hidden Sword Manor, and he’s stronger than Ye Qingtian. If Shengling is willing to make a move, it won’t be a problem to defeat Ye Qingtian,” Gu Zijing smiled.

“I’ve already grasped Astral Sword Intent six months ago, and I’m one step away from reaching lesser mastery. I feel that I can make a breakthrough if I fight him,” Shengling smiled. His pupils shone with a bright excitement, wanting to make Ye Qingtian his stepping stone. If he defeated Ye Qingtian, not only could it allow his sword dao to make a breakthrough, but it could also spread the Sword Alliance’s reputation, killing two birds with one stone.

“Anyone else want to challenge me?” Lin Yun stood with his hands behind him, sweeping his gaze crossing over all the Sword Alliance’s present geniuses.Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Sensing his gaze, no one dared to raise their heads. No one dared to stand forth after Ye Qingtian defeated three geniuses with one sword.

“Allow me.” Feng Shengling stood out, descended from the palace, before landing on the Kunpeng statue. He released a faint sword ray, a sacred aura that fused with the Kunpeng statue beneath him. The powerful sword aura Feng Shengling gave off was like a pair of Kunpeng’s wings behind him.

“Is that the legendary Heavenly Peng Sword Sutra of the Hidden Sword Manor?”

“I believe so. I heard that reaching the peak with the sword sutra could manifest the Kunpeng Sword Aura!”

“Feng Shengling is truly worthy of being known as a genius. With him making a move, Ye Qingtian can finally be defeated.”

After three defeats, everyone from the Sword Alliance was more low-profiled than before and didn’t dare to be confident with their words. But their eyes were blazing as they looked at Feng Shengling with anticipation in their pupils. Feng Shengling contained their hopes. He had to win, no matter what.

Feng Shengling stood on the Kunpeng statue and smiled, “You’re a genius swordsman from the Heavenly Dao Sect, while I’m a genius swordsman of the Hidden Sword Manor. We’re both geniuses, and I believe this battle will be interesting.”

Lin Yun instantly noticed the meaning behind Feng Shengling’s words and asked, “You’re saying that geniuses also have to compete with each other?”

“That’s right.” Feng Shengling descended from the statue and stood ten steps before Ye Qingtian. He said, “In terms of sword dao, there’s no way the Heavenly Dao Sect’s geniuses can be compared to the Hidden Sword Manor’s geniuses.”

“How high is the difference, then?” Lin Yun smiled.

“The difference is akin to the giant sword hovering over the cauldron!” Feng Shengling said pridefully.

“It’s nearly as high as heaven,” Lin Yun said.

“Hahaha, that’s right. This sword of mine is even higher than the sky!” Feng Shengling laughed and released his Astral Sword Intent, unleashing a terrifying sword intent that tore apart the thirty-six layers of heaven.

As starlight shone down, Feng Shengling became enveloped in a dazzling sword ray. That was the genuine Astral Sword Intent. Feng Shengling might be cocky, but he did qualify to be cocky.

Everyone in the surrounding area could feel their blood boiling when they saw this scene and couldn’t help cheering. But when the sword intent fell onto Ye Qingtian, it didn’t sway him.

“As expected, you have grasped the Astral Sword Intent,” Feng Shengling smiled.

Lin Yun didn’t release his Astral Sword Intent. But the fact that he could withstand Feng Shengling’s Astral Sword Intent proved that he was standing on the same level.

“Genius against genius, astral against astral. This way, I’m not taking advantage of you,” Feng Shengling said. “Do you have a glory saint artifact? I can loan you one if you don’t.”

“No need. You can make your move,” Lin Yun said.

“You’re cocky enough. I like it!” Feng Shengling smiled. He could sense a pressure coming from Ye Qingtian. His instincts told him this wouldn’t be an easy battle and it would take at least a thousand moves. Furthermore, his odds of victory only reached 70%, but his blood was boiling with his fighting spirits blazing. This was the opponent he wanted, and only someone like Ye Qingtian was worthy of becoming his stepping stone.

The two were only ten steps away from each other, but they weren’t in a hurry to make a move. The one who made the first move would gain the advantage in the battle, but they would also reveal their flaws. At this moment, they were both staring at each other with their auras clashing together, one overbearing while the other was calm and composed.

This fellow is really patient. Feng Shengling inwardly muttered before making the first move. Before anyone could respond, Feng Shengling’s sword reached Ye Qingtian’s neck It looked like Ye Qingtian’s head would fly the next second.

But suddenly, a hole appeared in Feng Shengling’s chest with blood gushing out. Feng Shengling flew a hundred steps back and fell onto one knee. The outcome of this battle had been determined.

“I forgot to tell you, but I’m the strongest genius swordsman in the past and the next five hundred years,” Lin Yun said.
