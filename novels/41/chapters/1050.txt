FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Everyone was shocked by Lin Yun’s appearance and his invincible pressure. Lin Yun didn’t look like someone who would die soon.

The Nether Divinity Realm Son declared that he would make Lin Yun crawl into the plaza, but clearly things did not go according to plan.

“What a powerful sword intent!” When the crowd examined Lin Yun’s sword intent from close up, they were in awe. Reverence filled their eyes because Lin Yun was a genuine genius in the way of the sword.

After all, it was already impressive for those to grasp spiritual sword intent in the Heavenly Path. However, Lin Yun had grasped the greater mastery of sky sword intent, making everyone else seem dull.

The crowd had never seen such a piercing sword intent before, so they were fearful. If Lin Yun could leave and go to the Saint Spiritual Lake, he might reach the level of the Realm Sons.

At this moment, the crowd could see the ugly expressions of the Realm Sons. The Nether Divinity Realm Son was especially angry as he sneered, “You’re so energetic,but this is as far as you go!”

In the next second, generals and others on the gold ranking flew into the sky and stood before Lin Yun. One of the generals barked, “You really dared to come!”

“Lin Yun, you sinned by killing people from the war realms. Why aren’t you on your knees begging for forgiveness?!” A gold ranking genius barked. With the three Realm Sons present, no one was afraid of Lin Yun.

Lin Yun casually looked around and noticed many people from the gold ranking standing in his way. It was as if no one wanted to miss out on such a grand occasion.

“I don’t wish to harm others while going after the war realms. I can spare your lives if you leave now!” Lin Yun’s voice wasn’t loud, but he radiated brightly with a sword ray from his body.

“Hmph! Let’s suppress him together!” A general barked and everyone began to take out their treasures. They had no fear because they were confident that any one of the Realm Sons could suppress Lin Yun. Plus, if all three Realm Sons worked together, there was no way Lin Yun could win.

The battle broke out instantly as countless treasures radiated brightly. The entire plaza was dyed in various colors while shockwaves spread out in the air. Who would have thought that all the gold ranking geniuses would instantly fight Lin Yun.

The crowd didn’t dare to get involved in the battle because many treasures were in use. After all, the destructive force of all attacks had increased.

Lin Yun hovered in the sky and allowed the attackers to charge towards him. Meanwhile, his sword intent shined brightly in his eyes while his hair fluttered wildly in the wind. Then, a dragon roar echoed out of Lin Yun’s body.

With a lightning storm brewing, Lin Yun wielded his sword while unleashing an azure dragon. A boundless dragon aura exploded and fused perfectly with his sky sword intent. At this moment, everyone was feeling the pressure of an overbearing dragon.

Lin Yun’s immortal azure dragon sword aura was holding up all of heaven. Under the boundless sword aura, all of the attacks looked tiny.

Then, Lin Yun let out a ferocious roar as sword rays exploded out from him.

“Not good!” The Nether Divinity Realm Son’s face changed. The sky sword intent at greater mastery was already strong, but this was a combination of the azure dragon aura and sword intent. It was an unprecedented attack that overshadowed all of the powerful treasures gifted by the Realm Sons.

In front of such a powerful sword aura, every single treasure was suppressed. Lin Yun warned everyone, but they didn’t listen. So in just one exchange, all phenomena in the sky had been dealt with by Lin Yun’s sword ray.

Then, Lin Yun executed the Sun Chasing Art. Turning into a golden beam, he started to unleash countless sword rays. Aside from those on the gold ranking, no one could take a single attack head-on.

Lin Yun hovered in the sky with Iris Flowers spreading out. With each blooming flower, blood would spray as a genius fell to the ground. In the blink of an eye, Lin Yun had started a massacre.

Aside from geniuses on the gold ranking, dozens of people were killed. When Lin Yun showed up, he really slaughtered everyone that didn’t listen to his advice.

“Get lost!” Lin Yun pushed his palm out as he faced two geniuses on the gold ranking. Then, Lin Yun swept his glance onto Yue Weiwei who was tied on the pillar. However, he didn’t make a move yet.

“Big Brother Yun, don’t come over!” Yue Weiwei began to struggle anxiously and lightning would flicker on the shackles everytime she moved.

When Lin Yun saw the pain on Yue Weiwei’s face from the lightning, he felt heartache. However, he saw the message that Yue Weiwei was trying to pass him. She was telling him that it was a trap.

“Hmph, you want to leave? Too late!” The Profound Dragon Realm Son sneered as he retrieved a chain bracelet that was connected to his middle finger and wrist. Then, the chains emitted a silver brilliance while the sound of a wind chime rang.

Cracks began to appear on the plaza as nine thick shackles broke out of the ground. Every single shackle contained boundless power like nine venomous pythons that trapped Lin Yun.

“Dragon Locking Shackles!” The spectators exclaimed because this was the treasure of the Profound Dragon War Realm. Although it was a replica, each shackle was comparable to a transcendent dao artifact.

If nine shackles were activated at once, they were equivalent to nine transcendent dao artifacts. No one under the Empyrean Realm could break free from it. Most importantly, the Profound Dragon Realm Son could unleash 70% of the shackles' power.

Lin Yun didn’t dare to underestimate the power of the shackles. So he activated the Azure Dragon Saint Art, Iris Sword Sutra, and Azure Firmament Sword Sutra at the same time. In the next second, nine dazzling punches were unleashed, containing the maximum power of the Divine Glorysun Fist and Divine Glorymoon Fist.

Lin Yun knocked the shackles back with his punches, leaving fine cracks on the shackles. Simultaneously, the Profound Dragon Realm Son let out a soft groan.

“Flying Heavenly Seal!” Before Lin Yun could catch his breath, a figure had already arrived before him. The Elysium Trigram Realm Son appeared with a majestic seal blooming behind him. He had turned into a majestic mountain to suppress Lin Yun.

It was the secret technique of the Elysium Trigram War Realm with great fame even in Kunlun Realm. The Elysium Trigram Realm Son had moved too quickly for Lin Yun to react.

Lin Yun’s eyes flickered, but he didn’t retreat. He formed seals and summoned the Azure Dragon Saint Armor. Purple-golden dragon runes squirmed all over the surface of his body as he manifested his armor.

The Elysium Trigram Realm Son left just as quickly as he appeared. When his palm landed on Lin Yun’s chest, he immediately retreated while the Profound Dragon Realm Son took over.

The Profound Dragon Realm Son also had a dragon flickering around him as he unleashed a terrifying dragon aura. At this moment, he looked like a radiant sun as he threw a punch at Lin Yun.

Taking both attacks head-on, Lin Yun’s armor began to shatter. However, he threw a punch with the Divine Sun Breaking Seal to manifest a Golden Crow. When his punch landed on the Profound Dragon Realm Son, blood dripped from the latter’s lips. The Profound Dragon Realm Son couldn’t accept the fact that he was injured.

He tried his best to block Lin Yun’s sword aura as he threw a punch in retaliation. The Profound Dragon Realm Son had created a situation where he and Lin Yun exchanged dozens of punches in the blink of an eye.

Countless dragon images began to explode while many people were hit by shockwaves that turned them into ashes. A collision of this level had never been seen before.

In the end, the Profound Dragon Realm Son threw up a mouthful of blood as he was sent flying 1,000 meters away. The Profound Dragon Realm Son clenched his fist together with unprecedented ferocity written on his face. He couldn’t believe that he was actually sent flying from a punch.

Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon Saint Armor was tattered. His condition was just as bad as blood dripped from his lips. At this moment, everyone looked at Lin Yun with disbelief because he managed to face the Realm Sons head-on.

Suddenly, heaven and earth began to tremble as a rainbow peacock appeared behind him. When everyone looked at the peacock, they squinted their eyes in fear. “Holy spirit!”

A holy spirit represented a holy spirit martial technique. The Nether Divinity Realm Son hovered in the sky and looked at Lin Yun with disdain, “You’re courting death!”

The peacock unfolded its wings as a multicolored light began to shine. At this moment, the Nether Divinity Realm Son looked like a deity. Someone from the crowd couldn’t wait anymore and fell onto the ground. Shortly after, more people also fell to their knees.

“Holy spirit’s might!” However, there were some people who painfully endured the pressure of the holy spirit.

“Hahaha!” The Nether Divinity Realm Son laughed, “Lin Yun, this is the end!”

The aura he was giving off was too terrifying and everyone had given up hope for Lin Yun. There was no way he could survive the full power of a Realm Son.

“This is the end? Nether Divinity Realm Son, get down on your knees and beg for death!” Right at this moment, a ray of golden light streaked across the horizon and pierced through space.
