Chapter 866 - Descend!

The Heavenly Path was an ancient path, but no one knew when it appeared or why it appeared. In the ancient era, the ancient path was complete. However, in the Golden Era, the ancient path broke into nine parts.

The Heavenly Path was also one of the Golden Era’s main battlefields. The battle far exceeded everyone’s expectation and shook the entire Golden Era. Although the nine Heavenly Paths were smaller than the ancient one, they were still bigger than the Profound Amber Realm. The entirety of the Profound Amber Realm was like a drop in the ocean compared to the broken Heavenly Path.

This meant that many experts fell in the Heavenly Path and the number of powerful sects that were annihilated was unimaginable. There were even sacred grounds that were buried in the path. These were some of the things that made the Heavenly Path terrifying.

But now, the nine Heavenly Paths were opened to welcome a new era. The powerful sects in the Kunlun Realm would observe the competition between the realms, and pick the strongest geniuses to enter their sects as elites. In terms of foundation, there was no way a lower realm could compare to their Kunlun Realm.

But this also meant that countless geniuses from other realms would compete in the Heavenly Paths and a brutal battle would unfold. Most importantly, many geniuses would rise from the Heavenly Paths and grow into powerhouses. Those people were rare, but if a powerful sect bet on the right person, their influence would be shocking. A powerful sect could change overnight and turn into a sacred ground.

The geniuses of the Kunlun Realm were willing to risk their lives to descend into the lower realms for the inheritance and treasures of the Heavenly Path. The risk was great since they could die if they weren’t careful. However, there were countless inheritances and treasures left behind in the Heavenly Paths. If they were courageous enough to take a chance, they had an opportunity to soar into the sky.

At this moment, a beam of light tore through the space in the Heavenly Path like a sharp sword. When the beam of light tore apart the sky, eight figures were revealed.

The eight figures were Lin Yun and the others who came from the Profound Amber Realm. When they appeared, they realized they were falling from the sky. Everyone wanted to circulate their origin energy, but they realized that the circulation of their cultivation techniques was extremely slow.

“The rules here are different from the Profound Amber Realm. There’s no need to panic. Calm down and sense the spiritual energy here,” said Fang Shaoyu. Unfortunately, many people were terrified and didn’t hear what he said. If they didn’t have origin energy protecting them, everyone except for Lin Yun would die. However, even with his strong physique, Lin Yun wasn’t willing to take the risk.

It didn’t take long for some of them to start screaming. When they reached the ground, a few of them turned into piles of flesh. Zhu Qingshan and Zhao Chen threw up mouthfuls of blood as their faces turned pale. As for Fang Shaoyu and Yu Haotian, they merely groaned.

Lin Yun’s origin energy only froze for a brief moment before he quickly circulated the Azure Firmament Sword Sutra. When he landed on the ground, he didn’t even cause a cloud of dust.

Yue Weiwei also landed beside Lin Yun, gently and without harm. When she entered the Heavenly Path, her aura became deep and unfathomable, which made everyone look at her strangely.

“Isn’t the spiritual energy a little too dense?” Lin Yun was shocked when he circulated his cultivation technique. When he refined the spiritual energy, it instantly turned into currents of origin energy that coursed through his meridians. The spiritual energy here was even denser than the Profound Amber Mountain while also containing other energies such as astral energy!

Lin Yun opened his hand and circulated his sword sutra. In the next second, the spiritual energy formed a vortex on his palm. Soon, the outline of an Astral Pellet started to take form in his hand. He would be able to refine a complete Astral Pellet if he continued to do this.

The efficiency was a lot faster than when he was in the Profound Amber Realm. However, Lin Yun soon frowned because he could also sense dense demonic aura. The demonic aura was spread out in the clouds. The feeling it gave off wasn’t intense, but the amount was terrifying. He couldn’t imagine the changes that would occur once the demonic aura settled down.

“This should be the Ninth Heavenly Path,” said Fang Shaoyu as he looked around. He then explained, “The moon on every Heavenly Path is different. None of the other Heavenly Paths have a complete moon.”

“Are you sure that that’s the moon? It looks like the sun,” said Zhu Qingshan.

“Both the moon and sun exist in this place,” smiled Fang Shaoyu.

Everyone turned to look at the dazzling sun in the sky as well the countless stars beyond the clouds. The radiance of the starlight wasn’t weaker than the radiance of the sun and moon. It was a truly breathtaking scene.

Fang Shaoyu fell into deep thoughts and said, “The Ninth Heavenly Path should correspond with the Ancient Desolate Domain, one of the nine main cities in the Kunlun Realm. If we perform well, we’ll be accepted into the powerful sects in the Ancient Desolate Domain.”

The Kunlun Realm naturally had more than nine domains. There were over tens of thousands of domains and each domain was massive. However, the Kunlun Realm had nine main domains known as the Nine Lord Domains. There were also other dangerous places that were at the same level as the Nine Lord Domains.

However, only the Nine Lord Domains could give birth to powerful sects. As long as one could make it into a lord domain, they would be luckier than the geniuses in other domains. Fang Shaoyu seemed to know a lot about Kunlun Realm as it was everyone else’s first time hearing about it.

“He’s right. But the Kunlun Realm isn’t limited to just Nine Lord Domains,” said Yue Weiwei.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Fang Shaoyu smiled, “Of course I’m right. No one knows more than me about the Heavenly Path in the Profound Amber Realm.”

Yue Weiwei smiled and chose no to argue with him. Everyone else rested for a bit and tried to get accustomed to the rules of the Heavenly Path. When they opened their eyes, their eyes glowed brightly because they returned to their top states, so much so that they even made some improvements in their cultivation. The Heavenly Path really was an opportunity because they could cultivate even faster than in the Profound Amber Realm.

“The competition has started. Everyone who can make it here is a genius, so it’s best if we maintain a low profile. The Profound Amber Realm doesn’t have a high position among the countless realms,” said Fang Shaoyu as he looked at Lin Yun, “Don’t cause any trouble without sufficient strength. It’s best that you guys are prepared.”

He knew that Lin Yun shined brightly and killed two champions during the quota test. If Lin Yun maintained the same temper in the Heavenly Path, he would bring trouble to everyone else. It was important to endure.

Is he trying to lecture me? Lin Yun smiled before ignoring Fang Shaoyu.

“Since we’re going to form a group, we naturally need a leader. Brother Fang, why don’t you take that position?” Zhao Chen spoke up because he could naturally tell what Fang Shaoyu was saying.

Yu Haotian, who had fallen silent, folded his arms together and smiled, “Brother Zhao is right. This place is brutal and Brother Fang is the strongest here. Plus, you have the most knowledge out of all of us..”

Fang Shaoyu smiled and turned to look at Zhu Qingshan. Naturally, Fang Shaoyu said all of these things because he wanted to be the leader. After all, there were many benefits to being the leader.

“I listen to Lin Yun,” said Zhu Qingshan.

“I have no opinion,” replied Lin Yun. He had no intention of becoming the leader.

“Then I’ll take the job,” said Fang Shaoyu. He didn’t ask Yue Weiwei because he couldn’t even see through the mysterious aura she was giving off. Then, he took out a map from his interspatial pouch, which surprised everyone. Fang Shaoyu was prepared.

“We have to rush to the Dracophant Guardian’s ruin before night.” Fang Shaoyu stored the map and looked in a direction. “Come with me!”
