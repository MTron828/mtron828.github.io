Chapter 2123: Nine Secret Realms

After bidding farewell to Tian Xing, the Crane Fairy brought Lin Yun down, passing through the clouds and arriving at the platform on the Celestial Purging Mountain. Three women were waiting on the platform for a long time, with one of them showing anxiety on her face while occasionally looking at the clouds.

Compared to her, the two women were much calmer. They sat with their legs crossed and their eyes closed. Not too far away, the neighing of dragon horses could be heard. One was a white dragon horse, while the other was a crimson dragon horse.

Suddenly, a celestial crane descended from the clouds, and the lively woman joyfully yelled, “He’s here!”

The other two women sighed in relief when they saw Lin Yun descending with the celestial crane. But the two women didn’t seem as calm as they appeared and looked somewhat nervous. The three women were the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden Bai Shuying, Miao Yin Holy Maiden Xin Yan, and Bai Qingyu.

When Lin Yun saw the three of them, he couldn’t help wearing a smile on his face.

“Big Brother Ye, why are you only here now? We’ve been waiting for a long time, and we’re nearly scared to death by you.” Bai Qingyu said unhappily. She had a straightforward personality and didn’t have much reservation when speaking.

Bai Shuying glared at Bai Qingyu before she turned to Ye Qingtian and said, “Junior Brother Ye probably didn’t have a choice, and he also didn’t ask us to wait here for him.”

Bai Qingyu stuck her tongue out and smiled, ignoring her sister’s reprimand.

“It’s good that you’re out now. We still have time,” Xin Yan smiled.

“Sorry to keep you all waiting,” Lin Yun apologized. Everyone else had already left, but the three women waited for him. They were about to miss the Blue Dragon Record because of him, which naturally made him feel touched.

“Let’s get going first and walk on the way.” Bai Shuying jumped onto the white dragon horse and pulled Bai Qingyu before her.

Lin Yun hung his sword box from the saddle then jumped onto the crimson horse before pulling Xin Yan onto it as well. This shocked Bai Shuying because she had no idea why they had such a close relationship.

Lin Yun looked at Bai Shuying, and said, “Have you found the person you’re looking for?”

He was curious if Bai Shuying managed to find the person she was looking for, the person that made her so captivated when they had only met once.

Bai Qingyu was also curious and asked, “Big Sister, who’s my brother-in-law?”

“You talk a lot.” Bai Shuying knocked on Bai Qingyu’s head. She turned to glare at Lin Yun, “You also talk a lot.”

Lin Yun awkwardly smiled. When he saw the doubt on Xin Yan’s face, he said, “I’ll talk to you about it later.”

As the two horses galloped down the mountain, Lin Yun discovered a group of people standing in their way just when they were about to leave. The one leading the party was Chen Feng. Lin Yun was stunned because he had nearly forgotten about this junior brother from Indigothunder Peak.

Chen Feng was the first person who came in contact with him under Ye Qingtian’s identity. Aside from him, the others were also disciples of the Indigothunder Peak.

“Senior Brother, all of the disciples from Indigothunder Peak are here to send you off. We wish you victory and spread the name of my Heavenly Dao Sect!” Chen Feng cupped his hands together.

“We wish Senior Brother victory on this trip and spread the name of my Heavenly Dao Sect!” The other disciples echoed along with Chen Feng.

Lin Yun was touched when he saw this scene. They might not have the opportunity to experience the descent of the Blue Dragon Record, but they could witness it. But to wait for Ye Qingtian to send him off, they gave up on the opportunity to witness it so that Ye Qingtian wouldn’t be left alone.

Lin Yun was touched that these people waited for him to send him off when everyone else had left. Indigothunder Peak was ranked at the bottom within the Heavenly Dao Sect. They might not be talented cultivators, but they warmed Lin Yun's heart.

“You’re pretty popular!” Bai Shuying was also surprised, looking at everyone from Indigothunder Peak. There wasn’t a single person absent, and they were all waiting for Lin Yun.

Lin Yun took a deep breath and cupped his fists together, “I will ensure victory on this trip, and I will make sure no one bullies my Indigothunder Peak in the future.”

“Senior Brother, go on!” Chen Feng and the other disciples smiled. They didn’t mind if others bullied them, but they felt that the further Ye Qingtian climbed as the Senior Brother of the Indigothunder Peak, the prouder they could feel.

Under the gazes of the Indigothunder Peak’s disciples, the two stallions began galloping across the ground. Their dragon clan bloodlines were activated and they became like bolts of lightning flashing through the air. Their speed was comparable to ordinary Saint Realm experts. This was their innate talent.

Relying on their dragon clan bloodlines, they could continuously gallop at full speed, which not even Saint Realm experts could accomplish. They were so fast that their surroundings began to distort, with faint ripples spreading out. Those spatial fluctuations were dangerous because they would be devoured if they weren’t careful.

But because of the talent that their dragon clan bloodlines bestowed upon them, they wouldn’t fall into those spatial distortions.

Two days later, they finally arrived at their objective. This was the origin of the God Burial Mountain Range, where countless mountains had boundless plains, also known as the Desolate Devastation Plains.

There wasn’t any spiritual energy or opportunities here. It was a dead land that no one would step foot upon. But at this moment, this place was filled with an endless amount of people spread across the nine massive dragon-shaped mountains at the center of the plains. The nine mountains were the statues of the nine dragon lords.

But the statues were massive, reaching over a thousand feet in height, enveloped in a faint mist that made this place look like a celestial realm. There were all kinds of aerial demonic beasts flying around, making the nine mountains look like they were alive.

No one knew how the nine mountains were formed, but each mountain gave off an ancient dragon aura. Looking from afar, one would feel insignificant in comparison to it. They were no different from ants before the dragon mountains.

The surroundings were filled with cultivators, making the Desolate Devastation Plains look packed. But it was fortunate that there was a powerful dragon aura, and the pressure increased as one got closer to the mountains. If one didn’t have a cultivation at the Quasi-Saint Realm, they might not even be able to hover in the air.

The outer layer was especially packed, but the inside was spacious upon entry. Three women could be seen at the waist of the nine mountains, where a mist enveloped them. One of them was Mu Lingxue of the Heavenly Fragrance Divine Mountain. She held onto a blue book, which should be the Blue Dragon Record.

Lin Yun looked from afar and discovered that there wasn’t anyone on the dragon mountains, and this made him heave a sigh of relief because he knew he wasn’t late.

“Ye Qingtian!” Right then, a familiar voice called out to him, and it came from the Dao Yang Holy Son.

But when Dao Yang Holy Son called out to him, it instantly made Lin Yun the center of attention. Ye Qingtian’s name was very famous over the past years. Not only was he well known within the Eastern Desolation, but also across the Kunlun Realm. That was especially the case when he inflicted heavy injuries on three of the seven Venerables back in the cave, which made everyone know what a genius swordsman was.

“It’s really him!”

“It’s the Holy Maiden Killer. The one riding the horse with him is Miao Yin Holy Maiden, and beside him are the two sisters from the Bai Clan!”

“Damn it! I didn’t believe it in the past, but I have no choice but to believe that he’s a Holy Maiden Killer now.” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“I heard he’s also on the Divine Dragon Elite Ranking. On what basis? He better not run into me!” Many gazes were complicated when they looked at Lin Yun. There was envy and jealousy in their eyes. Some even declared that they would teach Ye Qingtian a lesson if he ran into them.

Lin Yun passed through the crowd and came to the Heavenly Dao Sect’s gathering spot. Many people here were saint disciples with cultivations at the Quasi-Saint Realm, and they nodded at Ye Qingtian to express their respect.

The Dao Yang Holy Son was very friendly as he called Lin Yun over, but two others stood beside him and looked at him with unkind gazes. Lin Yun naturally recognized them. One was Ye Feng, and the other was Zhang Jun. They were golden-generation geniuses of the Heavenly Dao Sect, with their cultivations at the Indigo Origin Phase of the Quasi-Saint Realm, and have grasped a greater dao.

Five quotas went to the God Burial Mountain Range. Aside from the Dao Yang Holy Maiden, Nether Orchid Holy Maiden, and Xin Yan, they were the other two.

After Lin Yun got off the horse, the Dao Yang Holy Son dragged him over and pointed at the mountains, “That’s the Nine Dragon Lord Mountains, and they flew out from the Blue Dragon Record four hours ago. The mountains were only ten feet in the beginning, but they grew to a thousand feet. It's as though they are alive.”

When Lin Yun raised his head to look at the mountains, he acknowledged that the mountains were too massive. He couldn’t even see the true appearance of the mountains from his position. He could only see half of the mountains, and the other half was hidden in mist.

“But the dragons don’t look the same.” Lin Yun swept a gaze at the mountains and noticed the differences. Although only half of the mountains were repealed, he instantly recognized the Blue and Azure Dragons.

“That’s right. Aside from the Blue, White, Indigo, Golden, Green, Red, and Silver Dragons representing the seven-colored dragons, there’s also the Azure Dragon and an ordinary True Dragon,” the Dao Yang Holy Son explained. “Each mountain has a secret realm. There are many saint elixirs and treasures in those secret realms, but we must make it through the trial before we can stay on the mountains.”

Lin Yun noticed that there was a different colored vortex beneath every mountain. That should be the entrance of the secret realms. But since it was a trial, it was also a place filled with treasures. To many people, this trip wouldn’t be in vain if they could collect some treasures in those secret realms, even if they couldn’t leave their names on the Blue Dragon Record.

“Each mountain has a hundred spots, meaning a hundred people can leave their names on the Blue Dragon Record. Since there are nine mountains, there are also nine hundred people.” Nine hundred people might seem a lot, but the Eastern Desolation alone had six holy lands, countless powerful sects, and ancient saint clans.

If one thought about it that way, it would be hard for even holy land geniuses to leave their names on the Blue Dragon Record.

“The hundred people will be divided into four grades, the Dragon’s Head, Dragon’s Claw, Dragon’s Torso, and Dragon’s Tail. The different grades means that the rewards would also be different. There’s only one spot on the Dragon’s Head, and the nine Dragon’s Heads would compete for the first at the very end,” the Dao Yang Holy Son said. He continued, “Since the end of the Darkest Era, there had never been something so grand over the past three millennia. The geniuses from the Eastern Desolation, Southern Border, Northern Ridge, and the Western Desert are gathered here. God knows how many underdogs will appear. Many people will be famous after today.”

The Dao Yang Holy Son looked forward to it, hoping that he could obtain a Dragon’s Head position. Even if he was a holy son and one of the Twin Stars of the Eastern Desolation, he wasn’t confident about obtaining a Dragon’s Head position.

“Hasn’t it begun yet?” Lin Yun asked.

“Not yet,” the Dao Yang Holy Son said. The Dao Yang Holy Son looked around in anticipation and said, “It hasn’t started yet, and many people have speculated that the Divine Dragon Envoy is waiting for the Flower Burial. The champions of the nine heavenly paths are here, and he’s the only one left. We’re all looking forward to seeing if Flower Burial will appear.”

Right then, Lin Yun felt a gaze directed at him. When he raised his head, he saw Mu Xueling looking at him. Simultaneously, the vortex linking to the nine secret realms was activated.

Seeing this, the Dao Yang Holy Son sighed, “It looks like Flower Burial won’t be coming.”
