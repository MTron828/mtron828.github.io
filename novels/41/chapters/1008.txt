Chapter 1009 - Forbidden Existences

The Yellow Sandy Plain was massive and the border of Four Phase City was locked down by someone. Some people would be fine heading over while some would disappear if they headed over. Lin Yun could tell that a group of people were locking down the entire region in search of someone.

The culprit who locked down this entire region didn’t appear, but Lin Yun could guess that this person must have a powerful force backing him up.

In the end, Lin Yun didn’t choose to take the risk and decided to leave the Yellow Sandy Plain. He would head towards the Four Phase City from the other regions. But when he reached a gathering point on the plain, he heard bad news.

The gathering point was a small-scale stronghold with an array and statue to resist the demonic aura and demonic beasts at night. There were many people in this stronghold like him who had discovered the abnormality in the Yellow Sandy Plain and wanted to find out what was going on.

“It looks like someone locked down the entrance to Four Phase City. It’s not just the Yellow Sandy Plain, but the other regions as well. It’s so weird…”

“Yeah, it’s weird. Some people managed to make it through while some got blocked. A friend of mine from a higher realm told me that a forbidden existence has made a move.”

“Forbidden existence? What do you mean?”

“What other forbidden existence can there be in the Heavenly Path? Don’t look into this matter or we might be killed.”

“But there are only three months left in the Heavenly Path, and we just want to head towards the Four Phase City…” There were powerful sects in the Four Phase City, which made it a safe place. With the Heavenly Path coming to an end, many people don’t have the qualification to participate in the last battle. But their thoughts were simple, they just wanted to end the competition safely.

But when Lin Yun heard that they were looking for someone, he couldn’t help locking his brows together. He started to wonder if they were looking for him. After all, his fortune in the Azure Dragon palace wasn’t a secret. Then again, Lin Yun couldn’t help feeling baffled because it was a little too unbelievable that they would look for him.

Right at this moment, Lin Yun sensed a gaze directed at him. He wasn’t surprised by it because he was wearing a cloak. But for some reason, he could feel something familiar. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

When Lin Yun turned around, the person staring at him left. Naturally, the stranger was trying to draw his attention. After a brief moment of hesitation, Lin Yun followed the stranger with Lil’ Red on his shoulder.

Just like that, the two passed through several streets before they stopped at a corner. A familiar voice sounded out as the stranger turned around, “It’s been a while.”

The stranger was Chen Xun, a weird person that Lin Yun ran into after entering the Azure Dragon Forbidden Realm. Chen Xun wanted to search for inheritances with Lin Yun. But when Lin Yun rejected that offer, Chen Xun ridiculed Lin Yun. Chen Xun disappeared after that and Lin Yun had practically forgotten about him. It seemed abnormal that Chen XUn wasn’t around in the Azure Dragon Palace despite his strength.

“It has. But we’re not that familiar with each other,” said Lin Yun after removing his hood. He wanted to see what game Chen Xun was trying to play.

Looking at Lin Yun, Chen Xun smiled, “You’ve exceeded my expectations. I heard that you managed to obtain the opportunity above fortune and you even killed Mu Xiuhan. I want to apologize for the words I said back then.”

“Forget it. I’m more interested in why you came looking for me.” Lin Yun didn’t sense any spiritual rune fluctuation or experts around. Clearly, Chen Xun didn’t have any ill intentions.

“What objective can I have? I only saw you by coincidence,” replied Chen Xun.

“Do you know what’s going on in the Yellow Sandy Plain?” Lin Yun asked.

“Didn’t you hear what they said? A forbidden existence made a move,” smiled Chen Xun.

Forbidden existence? There might be many forbidden regions in the Heavenly Path, but if this pointed towards someone or a force, then they were extremely strong. And in the Heavenly Path, only the War Realms could be called forbidden existences.

They were all terrifyingly strong with powerful inheritances and connections to the Kunlun Realm. From a certain angle, they could be considered geniuses from Kunlun Realm. In fact, in their eyes, higher realms were their subordinates.

It was common knowledge in Heavenly Path that a war realm couldn’t be provoked. Even some of the powerful sects in Kunlun Realm were afraid of them and didn’t dare to offend them. Naturally, they were called forbidden existences.

When Lin Yun looked at Chen Xun, Chen Xun showed no signs of uneasiness unlike everyone else gathered in the stronghold.

“Wait for a while if you want to head to the Four Phase City. They’ve taken it too far, which made many people unsatisfied. Several gathering points in the Yellow Sandy Plain plan to force their way over soon,” said Chen Xun.

With that, Lin Yun stayed in the stronghold for the next few days to comprehend the Divine Moon Breaking Seal and Iris Sword Sutra. He had fallen behind in his sword sutras, but his cultivation wasn’t slowed down thanks to the Divine Astral Pellets. And as time passed, he could sense that the number of geniuses gathered in the city continued to increase.

All of the geniuses had sensed the danger in the Yellow Sandy Plain, so they arrived at the stronghold. However, with the influx of people, conflicts naturally broke out. Additionally, many rumors started to spread, including rumors about Lin Yun.

“I heard that there’s a rising star from the Azure Dragon Region who obtained the opportunity above fortune.”

“I also heard about him. Apparently, he killed some people on the ranking even though he’s from a lower realm.”

“Yeah, he’s a terrifying swordsman. I heard that he’s called Flower Burial Sword Demon…”

“He’s not the reason why there’s a lockdown, right? After all, there are only three months left and an opportunity above fortune is pretty attractive.”

“It’s hard to tell.”

It’s related to me? But what’s with that nickname? Lin Yun smiled bitterly upon hearing the rumors. There were many people who died to his sword, but he wasn’t a bloodthirsty person.

Five days later, Lin Yun found several familiar people. They were Luo Chen, Qin Lin, and Jun Mengchen. They were also trapped in the Yellow Sandy Plain. When Lin Yun found them, they were also shocked to see Lin Yun.

“Brother Lin, why are you with these people?” Luo Chen whispered, warning Lin Yun to be cautious.

“Previously in the competition for the Gloryfire Spirit, that person suppressed many higher realm geniuses by himself. He’s not from a higher realm, but a lower realm like you. There’s something unusual about his origin. I fought him once and couldn’t even obtain an advantage,” whispered Luo Chen.

When Lin Yun heard that Chen Xun wasn’t someone from the higher realm, he couldn’t help being surprised. After all, Chen Xun ridiculed him for being from a lower realm. How could Chen XUn compete with the likes of Luo Chen?

But Chen Xun had no change to his face and chatted about the current situation with everyone.

“Everyone is unhappy and nearly ten gathering points plan to charge together three days from now. We don’t believe that we can be stopped,” complained Qin Lin. The three of them were also blocked from entering the Four Phase City. Although their names were on the ranking, no one gave them any face.

It was just as Chen Xun said, everyone was getting irritated by being trapped in the Yellow Sandy Plain. It was good news for Lin Yun because he didn’t want to draw too much attention without seeing how strong the War Realms were.

Looking at the resentment on the faces of Luo Chen’s group, he could tell that the geniuses from the War Realms were as strong as the rumors. Then again, Lin Yun wasn’t afraid of them.

Three days later, dozens of strongholds made their way towards Four Phase City. In total, tens of thousands of people had gathered. Lin Yun couldn’t imagine anyone daring to stop such a huge party.

“I wonder who the forbidden existences are looking for.”

“Someone tried to force their way in and died a horrible death. Many people on the ranking have been blocked.”

“I heard that it's related to the Flower Burial Sword Demon?”

“Lower your voice. You’ll lose your life if the Flower Burial Sword Demon is among the crowd.” The party was huge and everyone was filled with fear of the forbidden existence.

Meanwhile, Lin Yun was speechless. He began to wonder if this matter was related to him. But right at this moment, Lin Yun suddenly squinted his pupils when he saw a figure. Even the faces of Luo Chen and the others changed when they saw this person. However, they signaled Lin Yun to stay composed.
