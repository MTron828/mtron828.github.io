Chapter 2000 - One Woman, One Cat

While Lin Yun was making a breakthrough in the Three-Lives Realm, Lil’ Red hid with Bai Qingyu. Lil’ Red used its claws to dig a cave before covering it with rocks. When they were in the cave, Lil’ Red took out a Flame Crystal to bring light and warmth to the cave.

When Bai Qingyu woke up, she tried moving, but the pain made her face twitch. There were two bloody holes on her shoulders left behind by the Blood Crows, not to mention she broke all her ribs. Bai Qingyu’s face was pale as she wailed from the pain and tears rolled down her cheeks. She didn’t just suffer heavy injuries, most of her dragon pulses were destroyed, and she couldn’t even circulate her cultivation technique. This meant that she had been crippled.

“Why…” Bai Qingyu was horrified to discover that she might have to live as a cripple. As a genius, she was the princess of the Bai Clan ever since she was young, and yet she fell into the mud now. Most importantly, she lost the Stalewater Sword, a gift from her elder sister. At this moment, her mentality had collapsed with tears rolling down her cheeks, “Why!”

“Shut up. Do you want to lure the enemies over? You’re really annoying. Don’t you know what my big brother did to save your life?” Lil’ Red looked at Bai Qingyu with disdain. It initially didn’t want to care about Bai Qingyu because it could sense a terrifying aura coming from Xiao Jingyan, so it wanted to stay behind and help Lin Yun.

“But it really hurts…” Bai Qingyu sobbed.

“You’re really annoying.” Lil’ Red took a saint pellet and gave it to Bai Qingyu.

“I don’t want it. Just let me die,” Bai Qingyu said. She would rather die in Xiao Jingyan’s hands than live as a cripple. If she died in Xiao Jingyan’s hands, she wouldn’t owe anything to Ye Qingtian and wouldn’t have to feel guilty.

“You want to die with only this much injury? My big brother suffered worse injuries and still didn’t give up…” Lil’ Red said, but it quickly shut its mouth after noticing its slip of the tongue.

“Oh, right! Ye Qingtian was crippled in the past. Can he help me recover?” Bai Qingyu asked with her pupils shining brightly.

“I don’t know. Even if my big brother doesn’t, Lord Phoenix definitely has a way. But she probably hates you, and she might not save you.”

“You…” Bai Qingyu wanted to argue, but Lil’ Red took this opportunity to shove the pellet into her mouth. She felt much more comfortable when the saint pellet entered her mouth. Her injuries gradually recovered, but her dragon pulses were still damaged, and it would take some time for her internal organs to recover.

Bai Qingyu also knew that the saint pellet couldn’t recover her entirely. After she recovered a little, Bai Qingyu turned her head over and saw Lil’ Red licking its wounds. Her heart immediately became soft after recalling how Lil’ Red blocked the incoming attacks for her.

“Little Kitty, this is for you.” Bai Qingyu took out a silver saint pellet and handed it over.

“Profound Life Pellet!” Lil’ Red was surprised and looked at Bai Qingyu, “You’re really rich.”

Lil’ Red swallowed the Profound Life Pellet. The Profound Life Pellet was a ninth-grade healing saint pellet.

“Hmph, I have a lot of treasures. As long as you’re obedient, I’ll give you plenty of benefits,” Bai Qingyu said pridefully.

After swallowing the pellet, Lil’ Red noticed its injuries had recovered, and it said, “You’re not that hateful anymore.”

“Who said that I was heavy earlier? I’m not fat! I’m a great beauty!” Bai Qingyu rolled her eyes.

But Lil’ Red didn’t seem bothered and indolently said, “You’re fat in the eyes of a cat.”

“You’re saying that I’m adorable like a cat?” Bai Qingyu said happily.

Since Lil’ Red had just taken her saint pellet earlier, it went along with her, “I guess so. But why must you go after my big brother since you’re so adorable?”

“You’re only a cat, and you don’t know what it means to leave the clan. So I naturally have to do something for my big sister,” Bai Qingyu said after a brief hesitation.

“It has nothing to do with my big brother, who has a good relationship with your sister. Your sister even taught my big brother sword techniques before she left,” Lil’ Red said.

“I know my mistake now,” Bai Qingyu said in guilt, her head lowered. This was why she wanted to make it up to Ye Qingtian, but she only brought more trouble instead. This made her feel terrible, and she would rather die in her attempt to help Ye Qingtian.

When Lil’ Red spoke earlier, Bai Qingyu’s mood dropped once more with tears in her eyes.

Seeing this, Lil’ Red panicked, “Stop it right there. I hate seeing girls cry the most, and you’ll look ugly if you cry. I heard that someone who admits her mistake is good, and I believe my big brother won’t blame you for it.”

“Really…?” Bai Qingyu sobbed.

“Really,” Lil’ Red forcefully replied.

Bai Qingyu peed at Lil’ Red and said, “You’re really courageous. You’re better than all the men around me. If you’re a man, I might even fall for you. But I won’t call you stupid cat anymore in the future.”

Lil’ Red smiled when he heard that and said, “I’m not interested in you. I have to protect my purity before encountering my true love.”

Bai Qingyu laughed when she heard that and said, “What type do you like? I’ll introduce you when we get back.”

“Really?” Lil’ Red suddenly looked embarrassed and lowered its voice, “...is enough.”

“What? Did your tongue get tangled up?” Bai Qingyu asked.

“Don’t you have a white dragon horse? I like someone like your white dragon horse,” Lil’ Red said shyly.

Bai Qingyu laughed when she heard that. She said, “How dare you go after my horse! As expected of Ye Qingtian’s pet, you’re as lecherous as him. Lil’ Lan is a pure-blood and noble divine dragon horse. I love Lil’ Lan a lot.”

So her name is Lil’ Lan! Lil’ Red was briefly stunned before it said, “I’m not lecherous. She’s my true love.”

“Hmph, you’re lecherous.” Bai Qingyu snorted. She then blinked her eyes before she smiled, “But you’re a cat. So why did you fall for a horse?”

“You think I want to be a cat if I had a choice? I used to be a horse, galloping under the sunset and kicking anyone I didn’t like. But… my youth is gone,” Lil’ Red sighed.

Bai Qingyu was teased by that and caressed Lil’ Red’s head, “Alright. I left Lil’ Lan in the treehouse inn, and I can help you matchmake when we get back. If you guys get together, you have to treat her well.”

“Really?!” Lil’ Red immediately jumped up and began to smile lecherously.

This made Bai Qingyu frown, “Your smile is really lecherous. You still say that you’re not a lecherous cat?”

“I won’t smile again in the future and won’t do anything bad. I’ll beg Lord Phoenix to treat you when we get back.” Lil’ Red immediately shuts its mouth.

“Really?” Bai Qingyu widened her eyes.

“Really. Lord Phoenix likes me the best,” Lil’ Red said pridefully.

“That’s a promise, then!”CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“That’s a promise.” Lil’ Red and Bai Qingyu patted their hands together.

Bai Qingyu smiled but didn’t treat it seriously. She also didn’t know who this ‘Lord Phoenix’ was. She only found Lil’ Red adorable, and her emotions had calmed down because of Lil’ Red.

Lil’ Red said three days later, “I’m afraid this place isn’t safe.”

“Why?” Bai Qingyu asked.

“If big brother had killed Xiao Jingyan, he’d come and look for us. Since he didn’t come to find us, something must’ve happened. So Xiao Jingyan will find us to force big brother to appear,” Lil’ Red analyzed.

“How good would it be if my brother-in-law was here? Xiao Jingyan is surely not his opponent,” Bai Qingyu nodded.

“Your brother-in-law is definitely not as good as my big brother,” Lil’ Red said in disdain.

“My brother-in-law is a hero. Ye Qingtian might be strong, but he’s definitely not as strong as my brother-in-law,” Bai Qingyu refuted.

“My big brother can easily squash your brother-in-law.”

“M-My brother-in-law can easily defeat Ye Qingtian with one finger,” Bai Qingyu argued, her face red.

“My big brother can easily kill your brother-in-law with one finger.”

“My brother-in-law can kill Ye Qingtian with a blow,” Bai Qingyu said with her face becoming red.

“Boast, carry on boasting,” Lil’ Red mocked.

Bai Qingyu wasn’t willing to admit defeat and argued, “Hmph. My brother-in-law is the best!”

“My big brother is the best!” Lil’ Red argued.

“My brother-in-law is the best!” Bai Qingyu raised her head.

Suddenly, footsteps could be heard. Lil’ Red and Bai Qingyu quickly shut their mouths, becoming nervous. They didn’t want to run into Xiao Jingyan.

The huge rock covering the cave was suddenly moved aside as nine figures appeared. It wasn’t Xiao Jingyan but the Indigocloth Venerable, who they met back in the treehouse inn, and her eight god generals.

The Indigocloth Venerable was bewitching as she looked at Bai Qingyu and smiled, “I finally found you. It’s really hard finding you.”
