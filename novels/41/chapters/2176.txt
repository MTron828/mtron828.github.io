Chapter 2177 - Ceremony

“If not for him, our clan or the Demonspirit Clan might have been able to occupy one of the dragon lord titles,” Zhao Tianyu said. “He stole the Golden Lotus Flametree, and his threat is bigger than I’ve imagined. If there’s an opportunity, we have to get rid of him or he will become a great threat in the future.”0

Wang Muyan maintained her composure since this was what she had already expected. She said, “He’s very mysterious, and he’s not easy to deal with.”0

“Indeed, his identity is a mystery. I have been suspecting if he’s really Ye Qingtian or someone else,” Zhao Tianyu said.0

“If he’s not Ye Qingtian, who else can he be?” Wang Muyan smiled.0

“That’s not important because someone will deal with him,” Zhao Tianyu said with a grave expression, as though he was pointing towards something. He continued, “I believe that person will be more than willing. The only possible threats are the Heavenly Sword and Dao Sword. Although there’s a high chance that they won’t appear, we have to come up with a countermeasure. Oh, right. How’s the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda?”0

“Everything has gone smoothly. The artifact spirit has completely awakened,” Wang Muyan said.0

“The Heavenly Wheel Pagoda is a treasure of our sect, to begin with. It was seized by the Heavenly Dao Sect for so long. Now, it’s time for us to retrieve it. We will take back everything that we lost,” Zhao Tianyu said. If someone else heard what he said, they would probably be frightened.0

The Heavenly Wheel Pagoda was a time-space treasure of the Heavenly Dao Sect. The space inside could distort time, and it was important to a holy land. But if the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda was seized, the Heavenly Dao Sect would suffer a heavy blow, and they would lose their position as the strongest holy land within the Eastern Desolation.0

Aside from that, there were many treasures, cultivation techniques, and saint elixirs stored within it. So the consequences of losing it was great, and the Heavenly Dao Sect might not be able to withstand it.0

Right then, a figure appeared outside. When Wang Muyan and Zhao Tianyu turned their heads over, they saw Gu Xinyu, who fought Lin Yun during the Blue Dragon Record. Not only did he recover from his injuries, he seemed to have gotten stronger, instead. He came out of the Heavenly Yin Pagoda’s main hall while the Heavenly Yin Palace’s palace master was chatting with the Ye Clan’s Tough Peak Saint Sovereign.0

“The Ye Clan’s Saint Sovereign has agreed,” Gu Xinyu said excitedly.0

Hearing that, Zhao Tianyu smiled, “As expected. Since he nodded his head, there won’t be any changes to the plan. Just the likes of Ye Qianyu can’t cause any trouble for us. The Zhang Clan and Divine Dragon Empire are unclear, and the Bai Clan likes to hide their strength the most. As for the Ye Clan, they’re of no concern anymore.”0

“But he has a huge appetite, wanting fifty percent. They want fifty percent of the treasures within the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda,” Gu Xinyu said.0

“He can have it. At that time, let the Ye Clan deal with him. I believe the Ye Clan won’t refuse it,” Zhao Tianyu smiled. He wouldn’t bat an eye even if he gave the Tough Peak Saint Sovereign everything because the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda was the core, and the Blood Moon Sect didn’t lack resources.0

“We’re only waiting for the ninth of next month now!” Zhao Tianyu said with a trembling tone. He was clearly nervous. After all, they have been preparing for a few hundred years to deal with an immortal holy land, even if the Heavenly Dao Sect was already internally torn apart. Even so, they didn’t have absolute confidence of success.0

Even if they could succeed, they would have to pay a great price, but it must be done. Regardless of the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda or the Solar Lunar Divine Rune, they’re crucial to whether the Blood Moon Sect could regain its dominance within the Kunlun Realm once more. Especially the Solar Lunar Divine Rune because they wouldn’t be able to destroy Six Holy City’s seal without it.0

“Muyan, the Solar Lunar Divine Rune is related to you, but you don’t seem happy.” Zhao Tianyu noticed that there were some emotions within Wang Muyan’s thoughts.0

Wang Muyan smiled, “I have waited a long time for this day. But the sacred flame has burned in this place for so long, and I can’t bear to see it destroyed.”0

“It has to be destroyed for the sacred flame,” Gu Xinyu said with excitement.0

Lin Yun came to the Profound Maiden Courtyard. He initially wanted to look for the Serene Dust Great Saint, but she was nowhere to be seen. When he wanted to look at Xin Yan, he could only take a look at her from far away after learning that she’s refining a saint origin to make a breakthrough to the Indigo Origin Phase.0

There was a mist filling the plaza, and there was a huge buddha engraved on the cliff. Under the gaze of the buddha, Xin Yan became enveloped in golden radiance that made her look dignified.0

Lin Yun merely looked at her from afar, but couldn’t say anything for a long time. She possessed the Great Yin Saint Physique and had the Serene Dust Great Saint teaching her. The Buddhist nature within her was increasing, and her mortal nature was decreasing. This was because she was walking on the Buddhist path with no retreat.0

Xin Yan hovered in mid-air with the clothes of the Profound Maiden fluttering in the air. If a mortal saw this scene, they would definitely treat her as a living Bodhisattva.0

Seeing this, Lin Yun rested inside the Profound Maiden Courtyard for a night before returning to Indigothunder Peak. When he returned, he went to meet the Indigothunder Peak Master, and asked, “Peak Master, what day is the ninth of next month?”0

“Ninth of next month?” The Indigothunder Peak Master smiled, “Why are you suddenly interested in it? I’ll tell you about it even if you didn’t ask.”0Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Is there an event?” Lin Yun asked in a surprised tone.0

“It looks like you still don’t know about it,” the Indigothunder Peak Master smiled. “The ninth of next month is a ceremony held every ninety years. This ceremony is to honor the predecessors, and everyone from the two palaces, three courtyards, and seventy-two peaks will show up. Aside from that, the competition of the Upper Nine Peaks will be held on that day. Not only will the Upper Nine Peaks be reshuffled, but the order will also be determined again.”0

The Upper Nine Peaks were the nine strongest peaks amongst the seventy-two peaks, and their positions were roughly the same as the three courtyards. The resources that the Upper Nine Peaks’ disciples could enjoy far exceeded the other peaks. Since Indigothunder Peak was always ranked at the bottom, they naturally couldn’t compete for it.0

Lin Yun pondered because the Upper Nine Peaks’ competition wasn’t as important as what Wang Muyan told him. But why choose that day? Was it related to the ceremony?0

“Are there any special events at the ceremony?” Lin Yun asked.0

“Special events? Of course. We will try and see if we can recall the Emperor Sword, but no one has hold much hope for it for the past few hundred years,” the Indigothunder Peak Master held onto his beard and said, “It has more significance, instead. This ceremony will be held at the Heavenly Yin Palace and Dao Yang Palace, and most of the Saints will be present to watch. At that time, the phenomenon of the ancestor will appear, and this is an opportunity to comprehend dao for Saints.”0

“I see…” Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts, but he still couldn’t figure it out. There should be an important point in the Indigothunder Peak Master’s words, but he couldn’t figure it out. He suppressed his doubts, and asked, “What are the rules for the Upper Nine Peaks’ competition?”0

If possible, he wanted to help the Indigothunder Peak obtain a spot on the Upper Nine Peaks.0

“The rules are simple. The current Upper Nine Peaks will send out a saint disciple for the sixty-three peaks to challenge. They will lose their qualification as the Upper Nine Peaks if they lose three times in a row,” the Indigothunder Peak Master said. “If they only lose once, the other peaks can still compete. But they will be eliminated after three losses. But the Upper Nine Peaks are mainly controlled by the four major clans, and the other peaks can’t compete with them in terms of geniuses.”0

Lin Yun understood what he meant. Losing three times meant changing three saint disciples. After all, it was impossible to fight multiple opponents if other peaks focused on nurturing an expert with all their resources.0

“Why don’t I give it a try?” Lin Yun asked casually.0

“That’s my intention, but not anymore. Saint disciples aren’t restricted by their age, so this means that the oldest one can be a hundred years old,” the Indigothunder Peak Master smiled. “The strongest saint disciples are a hundred years old, and they’re all at the Heavenly Origin Phase. Even if you’re the Heavenly Dragon Lord, you might not be able to gain any advantage from them.”0

Lin Yun was speechless because the saint disciples who participated were geniuses. Aside from the resources of the four major clans, it was possible to nurture a Quasi-Saint to the Heavenly Origin Phase.0

“You’re only at the Azure Origin Phase, so there’s no way you can fight a Quasi-Saint at the Heavenly Origin Phase, even if you’re strong,” the Indigothunder Peak Master said.0

“Well, that’s not entirely wrong,” Lin Yun smiled. If he was still in the Azure Origin Phase, he might not be confident in winning.0

The Indigothunder Peak Master thought that Lin Yun had restrained his temper a lot, so he smiled, “That’s more like it. Otherwise, you might embarrass yourself as the Heavenly Dragon Lord. After all, who wouldn’t want to defeat the Heavenly Dragon Lord? Once you reach the Heavenly Origin Phase, they might not be able to withstand a sword from you, so you can deal with them at that time. We’re not in a hurry.”0

“Peak Master, I’m already at the Indigo Origin Phase,” Lin Yun smiled. The moment he spoke, two dao flowers bloomed behind him. They were the Wind Dao and Thunder Dao.0

As an indigo radiance shone from him, a powerful aura swept out that left the Indigothunder Peak Master shocked. Lin Yun was only at the Indigo Origin Phase, but the aura he gave off wasn’t any weaker than a Quasi-Saint’s at the Heavenly Origin Phase.0

“Let me give it a try,” Lin Yun winked. He smiled, “If I can’t beat them, I will back down and won’t give them the opportunity.”0

Who dares to pretend in front of him? Lin Yun wasn’t stupid, he just wouldn’t give them the chance.0

The Indigothunder Peak Master briefly hesitated, before he said, “It looks like you can really give it a try. But don’t bother competing for the champion title, just one of the Upper Nine Peaks is enough.”0

“Any treatment for the champion?” Lin Yun asked.0

“Some rewards, but the best reward should be the qualification to place the incense stick,” the Indigothunder Peak Master said. “This is a ceremony, and the first incense will be placed by the champion.”0

Lin Yun held onto his chin, realizing that this might be an opportunity. If the predecessors of the Heavenly Dao Sect appeared, he would be able to benefit greatly if he could obtain something from them.0

“Alright, I got it.” Lin Yun felt that he could give it a try.0

“Don’t be too arrogant. You’re now the Heavenly Dragon Lord, and your actions will attract everyone’s attention. So you have to keep a low profile and stay humble,” the Indigothunder Peak Master said.0

“Peak Master, I have always kept a low profile. Do you have a misunderstanding of me?” Lin Yun smiled.0

“Do you think I’ll believe you?” The Indigothunder Peak Master said, “Since when have you kept a low profile? You provoked the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden the moment you’re back, displayed your might on the Ranking Battle, reached the ninth level on the Celestial Purging Mountain, and caused a huge mess during the Sword Assembly.”0

Lin Yun helplessly said, “Peak Master, I’m actually a humble person, and I’m famous for having a good temper. Everyone in the sect knows about it.”0

“Bullshit. Just compete for the Upper Nine Peaks obediently and don’t do anything more,” the Indigothunder Peak Master said.0

Lin Yun bitterly smiled, feeling wronged that the Indigothunder Peak Master didn’t believe him. Since when did I have a bad temper?
