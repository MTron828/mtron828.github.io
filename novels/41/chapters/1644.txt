Chapter 1645 - Torrential Killing Intent (1)

Everyone briefly rested before they left this place. Before leaving, Lin Yun turned back to look at the hall. A cellar should be hidden here with various Dragon Clan’s wines stored. Those could be comparable to top-tiered divine pellets. But since Jiang Ling loved wine so much, he decided to leave them there.

When they opened the door and left the hall, they arrived at the mountain of corpses. The mountain was bald, and many of the saint elixirs that were previously there were all plucked. Thus, this made everyone let out a sigh of pity. After all, those saint elixirs were top-tiered, but they were probably in the hands of Qin Tian now.

“Let’s quickly leave the saint palace.” Gu Ruochen said. Just like that, they went back from where they came from. The entire saint palace was empty, with no one being seen.

“Where are the disciples of my Sword Sect?” Mu Xueqin’s face suddenly changed.

Ye Qingxuan brought Ji Shuxuan and Jin Xuanyi to look for the other Sword Sect’s disciples, but there wasn’t any news about them. The other sects’ disciples had also disappeared, making everyone feel that something wasn’t right.

“Don’t worry about it, for now. They might have already left this place ahead of us.” Lin Yun said with a slight change on his face.

“Let’s hope so.” Everyone whispered, but they had an ill phenomenon in their hearts.

In the Ancient Barren Battlefield, Dragon Gate Altar was the passage between this battlefield and the outside world. If anyone wanted to leave the battlefield, they would have to pass through the Dragon Gate Altar.

But today, there were many Profound Sky Sect’s disciples beneath the altar. There were six to seven hundred, with a rough estimation. Each of them was emitting a chilling, killing aura, and they each held onto an ancient jade. When they poured their dragon origin into the jade, it formed a massive array that enveloped the entire altar.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Senior Brother, they’re out from the saint palace!”

“That’s Lin Yun, alright.” Qin Tian suddenly opened his eyes. A black saint pellet was in his hand, and he refined about 70% of it. He had a massive harvest on this Blue Dragon Saint Palace trip. Not only were there a lot of incomplete martial techniques, but there were also various saint pellets and secret treasures. The saint pellet in his hand was called the Heavenly Origin Saint Pellet, and only the Dragon Gate knew how to refine them.

If he refined it, it could significantly boost his cultivation and allow him to obtain the exact origin as heaven for a short period. Under that state, it would substantially increase his cultivation of martial techniques or comprehension of his martial intent. After all, that state could only be achieved by saints, so this experience was precious.

“Finally coming out?” Qin Tian slowly stood up as a boundless sacred light appeared behind him, soaring toward the demonic clouds that instantly turned into a terrifying screen. At this moment, he was like a Saint, possessing the exact origin as heaven.

In the direction of the altar, the disciples of the various sects, regardless if they were disciples of holy lands or demonic sects, were all lying on the ground with serious injuries.

“Qin Tian has gotten stronger than before.” The Heavenly Note Sect’s Lin Wan whispered. Beside her, the chief disciples of the other powerful sects had horror on their faces.

A few days ago, the Profound Sky Sect’s disciples sealed off the exit, not allowing anyone to leave, and even forcibly seized their harvests in the Blue Dragon Saint Palace. But even so, they still didn’t let them go beforehand because they wanted to deal with the Sword Sect, and Qin Tian didn’t wish for the news to get out.

Half an incense’s time later, Lin Yun’s party appeared in this region, and they were surprised when they saw this scene.

“Lin Yun, I’ve been waiting for you for a long time!” Qin Tian coldly looked at Lin Yun. “Bring them over!”

Liu Xu’s facial expression was sinister, and it didn’t take long for him to escort all the Sword Sect’s disciples over and force them onto their knees. He roared, “Kneel!”

But the Sword Sect’s disciples didn’t care about him, and none of them were willing to go down on their knees. Anyone could tell that their cultivation had been sealed, but they still gritted their teeth under the immense pressure.

“I asked you guys to kneel!” Liu Xu sinisterly laughed and smashed Ye Qingxuan’s knee with a kick. This made Ye Qingxuan scream in pain, blood flowing down from his knees.

But even with his knee smashed, Ye Qingxuan still gritted his teeth and remained standing. The other Profound Sky Sect’s disciples also smashed the Sword Sect disciples’ knees.

This scene made Mu Xueqin’s face pale, and she nearly fainted. When Gu Ruochen saw this scene, he was on the verge of charging forth.

But Lin Yun quickly held onto him and said, “Senior Brother, don’t be impulsive. They have set up the Profound Sky Array around the altar. You’ll be courting death if they activate it when you get close.”

“I want him dead!” Mu Xueqin gritted her teeth, her pupils becoming bloodshot. She had grown up in the sect since she was young. So everyone in the Sword Sect wasn’t just her fellow martial brothers and sisters, they were her kin.

“Believe me. I can save them.” Lin Yun said.

Gu Ruochen and Mu Xueqin were briefly stunned upon hearing that. When they turned to look at Lin Yun, they could see that he was calm and without any emotions.

“Lin Yun, hand over the Wind God Order if you want your fellow martial siblings’ lives, along with the inheritance in that mountain!” Qin Tian waved his hand, stopping the Profound Sky Sect’s disciples, and eerily looked at Lin Yun.

“Wind God Order? We didn’t see any Wind God Order…” Gongsun Yan said.

“Who do you think you are to interrupt me?” Qin Tian stood on the altar and looked at Gongsun Yan from afar. A golden seal appeared within his pupils' depths, giving him the feeling of a Golden Dragon.

This immediately injured Gongsun Yan’s soul with a stinging pain in his pupils. So he quickly closed his eyes and swiftly retreated. He was fortunate that his soul had been tempered by the Azure Dragon and even refined a droplet of the Azure Dragon’s Saint Blood. Otherwise, he would’ve lost his eyes from that attack earlier.

“Argghh!” Gongsun Yan’s lip twitched. It felt like several needles were piercing into his eyes, and he couldn’t resolve the pain, no matter what he tried.

Right then, Lin Yun placed his hand on Gongsun Yan. As he activated the Blue Dragon Bone, blue divine light flowed into Gongsun Yan’s body through his hand. When the blue light entered Gongsun Yan’s body, blood dripped down from Gongsun Yan’s eyes and a poisonous miasma was evaporating from it.

“Blue Dragon’s Divine Blood?” On the altar, Qin Tian’s face changed because he could sense the aura of Blue Dragon’s Divine Blood within Lin Yun’s body. He was briefly stunned before he rejoiced, “Lin Yun, you still say that you didn’t receive any inheritance? You have the aura of Blue Dragon’s Divine Blood on you! Today, all the Sword Sect’s disciples will die! Look after them well. Today, I’ll let everyone know that even the Radiant Sword Saint’s disciple will kneel before me!”
