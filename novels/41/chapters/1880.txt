Chapter 1881 - True Man Never Turns Back

Lin Yun’s words made the faces of the Nether Orchid Courtyard’s disciples ugly because he was simply too arrogant. He was also shameless because anyone could tell that Bai Shuying didn’t use her full strength earlier. After all, she was at the Nirvana Stage, and there was no way Ye Qingtian could withstand it if she used her full strength.

But Ye Qingtian made it sound like he could take two attacks from Bai Shuying, not to mention that he even dared to provoke her even more.

Despite seeing that Lin Yun had gotten a lot stronger compared to a year ago, this didn’t mean that he had the qualification to speak those words to Bai Shuying. Not only him, but many of the Nirvana Stage saint disciples could only look up to Bai Shuying.

“Senior Sister, don’t go easy on him and teach him a lesson!”

“This lecher is too much!”

“Based on what he did a year ago, no one will say a thing if Senior Sister cripples him now.” The Nether Orchid Courtyard’s disciples spoke out.

“Ye Qingtian is a scumbag, to begin with. There’s no need to go easy on him.”

“Yeah. There’s no need to go easy on someone like him.”

“So what if he has gotten much stronger than a year ago? He’s still the same person he was before. He’s the shame of the Heavenly Dao Sect!” The other peaks’ disciples echoed along, and Ye Qingtian instantly became the public enemy. Half of the people looked at him with disgust, and the other half were jealous of him.

Many people panicked due to Lin Yun’s performance because no one could accept that Ye Qingtian had risen in position.

Empress, are you done? Lin Yun pursued as he began to panic.

“A little more time.” Lil’ Purple replied, and her reply made Lin Yun speechless.

Bai Shuying coldly looked at Lin Yun, “Ye Qingtian, you’re saying I’m not upright in launching a sneak attack against you?”

“Senior Sister, you’ve misunderstood me. I’m just praising your beauty, and there’s no one like you amongst all the women I’ve met…” Lin Yun smiled.

“Shut it!” Bai Shuying’s face became cold, as if Lin Yun had crossed her bottom line, and her suppressed killing intent swept out. With a wave of her hand, nine swords of the Nether Orchid Courtyard’s disciples flew towards Lin Yun.

When the nine swords flew over, they didn’t display any phenomena this time and only flew towards Lin Yun, containing powerful sword intent and dragon origin. Bai Shuying had used her sword intent, and it had reached the level of Quasi-Heavenly Dome Sword Intent.

Anyone could tell that Bai Shuying was no longer holding back under her rage, and the nirvana aura in her attack had far surpassed the first channel of the Nirvana Stage. Facing this attack, not many people present were confident of fending it off.

Lin Yun closed his eyes and used his Sword Heart to observe the surroundings. When he closed his eyes, he could clearly see the trajectory of the nine swords, and the flaws were fewer than Lin Yun had expected. There might be many flaws on the surface, but some were traps, mixing the real and fake.

Lin Yun took a deep breath because he realized he had underestimated Bai Shuying. The latter might seem furious, but she launched her attacks meticulously. She had already discovered that he was proficient in finding the flaws in the sword techniques of others and thus set up this trap for him.Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Although Lin Yun could quickly resolve this attack if he brought out the Heavenly Dome Sword Intent, her actions piqued his competitive spirit. Since Bai Shuying liked to put up a strong front and suppress him, he would go against her thoughts, then. He opened his eyes with a smile because he finally found the flaw and allowed the nine swords to get close to him.

Just when everyone thought Lin Yun would turn into a porcupine, Lin Yun suddenly grabbed onto one sword, ignoring the other eight.

“Senior Brother!” The Indigo Thunder Peak’s disciples exclaimed with their faces changed when they saw this scene.

But what happened next was bizarre because the eight swords brushed past him, with two brushing past his face. This scene naturally shocked everyone because he was too bold.

In this attack, only one was real, and the other eight were fake. The sword Lin Yun grabbed was the actual attack directed at him. But if he moved, the other eight swords would become actual attacks directed at him. So Bai Shuying’s attack tested not only his eyesight but also his courage.

“H-How is this possible?!” Bai Shuying’s face finally changed, and she couldn’t help asking, “How did you manage to tell?”

Clasping his hands behind his back, Lin Yun smiled at Bai Shuying, “This further proves that our hearts are connected.”

“Hey, scumbag. Stop flirting with her. We can go now. The Solar Lunar Divine Rune is truly here, so we can come back another time to determine the actual location…” Lil’ Purple’s voice resounded within Lin Yun’s mind.

Right then, the ‘broken sword’ physique was activated, and the saint sword trapped in Lin Yun’s two fingers snapped. This instantly made everyone take in a cold breath because they had never seen anything like this. They didn’t see Lin Yun do anything, and yet the sword suddenly snapped into pieces.

Shaking his head, Lin Yun sighed before he smiled, “Three moves are over. I should stay behind, but it’s a pity everyone’s prejudice against me is too great. So I might as well leave this Sword Discussion Gathering.”

Bai Shuying was stumped when she heard that because she had no idea what Lin Yun was trying to do. After all, Lin Yun wanted to stay behind just a moment ago and suddenly wanted to leave after three moves. This made her even more confused about Lin Yun’s objective.

“Ye Qingtian…” Bai Shuying couldn’t help calling out.

But Lin Yun simply ignored her and walked out of the Nether Orchid Courtyard with a jar of wine.

“Hahaha! People laugh at me for being insane, and I laugh at them for being unable to see through me!” Lin Yun laughed as he drank his wine and left. He knew he couldn’t turn back now and quickly left under everyone’s gazes. His pace was initially slow, but he sped up five steps later and quickly became blurred.

“Is this still the same senior brother we know? Isn’t he too dashing?!”

“Quick, follow him!” The Indigo Thunder Peak’s disciples came to their senses and quickly followed behind Lin Yun.

When Lin Yun left the Nether Orchid Courtyard, he heaved a breath of relief because he had accomplished his objective. He inwardly asked, “Is the Solar Lunar Divine Rune here?”

“I’m highly confident about it but can’t verify the location. Hehe, it looks like we made the right decision in coming to the Heavenly Dao Sect.” Lil’ Purple said in an excited tone within the Iris Secret Realm.

“That’s good. I nearly couldn’t keep on acting anymore.”

“Hmph, you seem to be enjoying it in my eyes. After all, the Nether Orchid Holy Maiden even called out your name at the end of it.”

“Cut it out. Who knows what Ye Qingtian did in the past? Bai Shuying nearly lost it, wanting to slaughter me for real. As long as I dare to retaliate, everyone in the surroundings will flock over, and I’ll die unjustly then.” Lin Yun was putting on a façade earlier. Even if he had no idea behind the story about Ye Qingtian, he could tell that Bai Shuying’s killing intent wasn’t fake.

“Hehe. Everyone else is shocked, but no one noticed anything unusual about you. I think that’s because you and Ye Qingtian are the same kind of people; both of you are scumbags.”

“Shut it,” Lin Yun said with his face turning dark. How could he possibly be the same kind of person as Ye Qingtian?

“Senior Brother, slow down. I can’t catch up with you!” Chen Feng gasped for breath as he ran over. When he looked at Lin Yun, his pupils shone brightly with respect.

“Senior Brother!” The other Indigo Thunder Peak’s disciples swiftly caught up and looked at Lin Yun with reverence. After what happened today, they had come to look at Ye Qingtian in a new light.

A smile returned to Lin Yun’s face, and he looked at the Indigo Thunder Peak’s disciples with a playful gaze. When he wanted to mimic Ye Qingtian’s tone and mock these people a little, sounds began to echo above the Nether Orchid Courtyard.

When Lin Yun turned his head over, he saw a group of women. Their hair was tied into buns, donning waist dresses, and ribbons covering their top. Furthermore, they all wore a smile as they played different instruments while flying in the sky.
