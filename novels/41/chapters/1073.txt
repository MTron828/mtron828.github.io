Chapter 1074 - Death

The bone was stained with blood and emitted an immense dragon aura. It was so bright that it made the surroundings shine. No one had ever seen the Azure Dragon True Bone before, but they instantly recognized it when they saw it in the Imperial Feather Realm Son’s hand.

At this moment, they knew that the mysterious Realm Son couldn’t be underestimated, especially when he was the one who forcibly seized a Divine Blood Fruit. Not many people had seen him attack, but it was shocking whenever someone saw it. Like right now when he had instantly dug out Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon True Bone.

Although Lin Yun was already injured by the Realm Sons, it was still unbelievable that the Imperial Feather Realm Son extracted Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon True Bone so quickly. There were rumors that Lin Yun had already fused with his Azure Dragon True Bone, which meant it wasn’t easy to steal. After all, Lin Yun would definitely retaliate as long as he still had a breath left.

But not only did the Imperial Feather Realm Son dig out Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon True Bone, he rendered Lin Yun motionless. At this moment, LIn Yun could sense that his origin energy and sword intent were being restricted.

“How is that possible…” Luo Chen’s party was the most shocked right now. After all, they had witnessed the demonic spirit get heavily injured when it tried to retrieve Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon True Bone back in the Azure Dragon Palace. If even that demonic spirit failed, how could the Imperial Feather Realm Son succeed?

Everyone was filled with doubt because no one really saw what the Imperial Feather Realm Son did. In fact, they didn’t even see when the Imperial Feather Realm Son appeared in front of Lin Yun. But regardless of their doubt, the Imperial Feather Realm Son was standing with the Azure Dragon True Bone in his hand.

The eyes of the five other Realm Sons flashed as they looked at the Imperial Feather Realm Son with complicated gazes. They were the ones who were heavily injured, but the Azure Dragon True Bone went to the Imperial Feather Realm Son. Naturally, none of them were happy.

However, they exhausted too much of their energy to do something. Then again, even if they were in top shape, some of them wouldn’t dare to compete with the Imperial Feather Realm Son. The Imperial Feather Realm Son was extremely mysterious among the ten war realms, and no one could really see through him.

“Something doesn’t seem right.” Suddenly, the Realm Sons looked at the Imperial Feather Realm Son with confusion. There was something odd about the Imperial Feather Realm Son obtaining the Azure Dragon True Bone.

Just when everyone was feeling uncertain, the Imperial Feather Realm Son suddenly moved. The Azure Dragon True Bone was releasing a series of dragon roars while thunderclouds rumbled in the sky. An ancient aura also began to leak out of the as profound runes began to appear.

“A divine rune!”

“Holy shit, that’s a complete divine rune!”

“The Imperial Feather Realm Son is suffering a backlash because the Azure Dragon True Bone hasn’t submitted to him.”

“That’s a complete divine rune. There’s a high possibility that this bone came from an Azure Dragon King!” Discussions broke out as everyone looked at the Azure Dragon True Bone. No one was sure if the Imperial Feather Realm Son would succeed or if he would end up in a terrible state.

While everyone’s attention was on the Imperial Feather Realm Son, Lin Yun’s body suddenly fell into the lake.

“Is he dead?”

“He’s already heavily injured. Since he lost his Azure Dragon True Bone, there’s no way he can still be alive.” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Hmph. Even if he doesn’t die, he’s bound to be crippled. But it was impressive that he dragged the Imperial Diagram Realm Son down with him and crippled the arm of the Nether Divinity Realm Son.”

“With the restrictions in the lake, there won’t be a Flower Burial Lin Yun ever again.” The Realm Sons swept a few glances at Lin Yun before they turned their attention away.

“Big Brother Yun!” Yue Weiwei cried out when she saw this scene from Lil’ Red’s back. Without any hesitation, she flew towards the Saint Spiritual Lake with rage in her pupils. Since Lin Yun had died, everyone else needed to die.

“How dare you!” But the moment she moved, the Heavenly Path Mirror in the starry sky restricted her movement. All of the elders from the sects were looking at her coldly.

“Lass, since you’re not participating in the final battle, you’re not allowed to interfere. Otherwise, we won’t leave you alone.” The Profound Sky Sect’s Elder Jin Jue said coldly while looking at Yue Weiwei.

“You old bastard!” Yue Weiwei gritted her teeth, but there was nothing she could do under the Heavenly Path Mirror’s restriction.

When the divine rune and the dragon aura in the Azure Dragon True Bone compressed and exploded, it unleashed a golden halo that sent the five Realm Sons flying away. When they fell to the ground, all five of them threw up blood. Then, they looked at the Azure Dragon True Bone with renewed fear.

“I’m lucky that he only unlocked one seal or else I would have been in trouble.” The Imperial Feather Realm Son’s eyes were filled with fear because he knew how rash it was to steal Lin Yun’s Azure Dragon True Bone.

Sensing the gazes from the other Realm Sons, the Imperial Feather Realm Son said, “I definitely won’t take this for myself since all of you have contributed. If anyone manages to become the champion in the final battle, I’ll give them the Azure Dragon True Bone. Then again, if I can become the champion, I’ll fork out items of equal value. What do you guys think?”

Although some of the Realm Sons weren’t happy, there was nothing they could do. Seeing that no one had an objection, the Imperial Feather Realm Son continued, “You guys have exhausted a great deal of energy and I was also injured. Why don’t we start the final battle an hour from now?”

“Agreed!”

“That would be best.” The other Realm Sons were happy to oblige to the suggestion. After all, they had exhausted a great deal of their vitality, not to mention that they were also caught by surprise by the Azure Dragon True Bone’s explosion.

Once everyone agreed, the Imperial Feather Realm Son threw up a mouthful of blood while his face turned pale. Everyone realized that the Imperial Feather Realm Son was heavily injured, more injured than anyone else.

The Realm Sons realized that they had been tricked. Everyone started scheming as they looked at the Imperial Feather Realm Son. However, the Imperial Feather Realm Son merely sat down and smiled, “Let’s fight an hour from now. As Realm Sons, we naturally have to keep to our words.”

After he was done speaking, he began to circulate his cultivation technique. He began drawing the floral saint liquid from the atmosphere into this body. Even though the other Realm Sons realized that they were tricked by the Imperial Feather Realm Son, they couldn’t do anything. So they sat down and began to recover too.

When the spectators saw this scene, they immediately began to devour the floral saint liquid. Just like that, the intense fight from earlier had become calm while everyone started fighting over the floral saint liquid. But everyone knew that this was just calm before the storm.

The Realm Sons were destined to be the main contenders for the floral saint liquid. After all, their region had the most floral saint liquid around. Naturally, no one tried to steal from the Realm Sons. After all, they were still thinking about the battle with Lin Yun.

When Lin Yun fell into the lake, his thoughts began to blur as he sensed his vitality quickly disappear. He relied on the Azure Dragon True Bone to summon the Azure Dragon Saint Armor to defend against the attacks of the five holy spirits. However, he was still heavily injured. So when the Imperial Feather Realm Son came at him, his sword intent couldn’t respond in time. It resulted in the Azure Dragon True Bone getting taken away.

The Imperial Feather Realm Son was too fast, which caught Lin Yun off guard. And now, Lin Yun couldn’t do anything. He had to accept the fact that his Azure Dragon True Bone was stolen for the time being. However, his fighting spirit was as lively as ever.

Despite his fighting spirit, Lin Yun was still losing consciousness. After all, he was heavily injured. He began to wonder if he was feeling death because his thoughts were fading away or if he just didn’t have the energy to gather his thoughts.

“Hmph. With this empress around, you won’t die that easily.” Just when Lin Yun’s consciousness was about to fade away, an ancient and domineering feminine voice sounded out in his mind. It was an unfamiliar voice, but at the same time, it felt familiar.
