Chapter 1718 – Who Dares To Touch My Big Brother Lin!

When two ancient scores overlapped, the phenomena created began to change. Just a moment ago, it was only the Ni Chang Dress Song. But it suddenly changed to a silver starry sky and phoenix, catching Kong Ying, Xiahou Feng, and Xin Wuhen by surprise.

The three had to work together. Even if they grasped the Saint Tone, their musical instruments were different. So even if they didn’t have any past interactions, they could swiftly adapt to each other and cooperate. After all, anyone who grasped the Saint Tone was a genius; they could instantly collaborate and blend their music.

But facing a monster like Lin Yun, they could feel their scalps tingle because they couldn’t catch up with him. In the beginning, they were evenly matched with the Prairie Phoenix Fire and found a method to deal with it.

When the three waves were about to swallow Lin Yun, the latter’s music changed to the Ni Chang Dress Song. But before they could adapt to the Ni Chang Dress Song, Lin Yun’s music changed again, ruining the rapport between the three.

As a terrifying silver starlight exploded from Lin Yun, it formed into a silver river. Raising his hand, the silver river shone with starlight as it flew towards Kong Ying, Xihou Feng, and Xin Wuhen.

When the trio raised their heads, their pupils were filled with shock. Xiahou Feng and Xin Wuhen, who played flutes, soared to the sky while Kong Ying slammed his palm on the zither, causing the zither to spin in mid-air. When the silver river flew over, the zither he stepped on turned in mid-air before returning to him.

“Help me.” Kong Ying said to Xiahou Feng and Xin Wuhen while catching the zither. With a dash, he arrived before Lin Yun.

Xiahou Feng and Xin Wuhen nodded as they used their musical notes to resist the phoenix cry and silver river. This allowed Kong Ying to land before Lin Yun and sat down. When he caressed the zither, the trio finally found their pace again.

When Kong Ying’s zither resounded again, beams of terrifying light rays shot out from his fingertips, and the light rays intertwined into various phenomena. There were thousands of fairies dancing on the lake, charging towards Lin Yun.

As Xiahou Feng and Xin Wuhen exchanged glances, they stowed their musical instruments. They then quickly circulated their dragon origin to unleash the full power of their martial dao while charging towards Lin Yun.

When everyone saw this scene, they had surprise flashing across their pupils. But everyone in the West Garden Banquet shared a rapport and reacted as if they saw nothing.

“Watch out!” Yun Xi of the Orchid Creek Valley yelled.

Lin Yun smiled when he saw this scene. Since they wanted to play, he would play with them. Xiahou Feng and Xin Wuhen’s objectives were evident. They were trying to make Lin Yun stop playing his zither before holding him back to let Kong Ying suppress Lin Yun with his music.

While grasping Noble Tone, Xiahou Feng and Xin Wuhen also had strong cultivation at the pinnacle of the sixth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. Perhaps their cultivation couldn’t be compared to Huang Xuanyi, but it was more than enough to deal with Lin Yun. This gave them confidence, and they could only resort to this because they knew it would be tough for them to defeat Lin Yun with their music dao.

“What are you two trying to take?” Lin Yun smiled, looking at Xiahou Feng and Xin Wuhen.

“Your life!” Xiahou Feng said coldly.

“Hahaha! Trying to resort to a heterodox method when you guys can’t defeat me with your music dao? You guys are still too tender!” Lin Yun laughed, and he stopped playing his zither. He smiled, “I’ll fulfill both of your wishes, then. Get lost!”

Lin Yun raised the Thunderstorm Zither and swung it at them. This caught Xiahou Feng by surprise, and he was sent flying back. But Lin Yun didn’t stop there. He placed the Thunderstorm Zither down before activating his Azure Dragon Saint Physique, mobilizing all hundred thousand dragon runes.

As a violent gale howled and thunder rumbled, Lin Yun threw his punch forth. Taking his punch head-on, Xin Wuhen threw out a mouthful of blood before he was sent flying back. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Simultaneously, a storm manifested by Kong Ying’s zither music swept over, and the fairies charged towards Lin Yun, wielding a sword. Everything happened too quickly, and Lin Yun suffered several cuts on his clothes before he could reach out for the Thunderstorm Zither.

In the blink of an eye, Lin Yun executed the Divine Sunchasing Art to the limit and soared to the sky. But just when he flew to the sky, the fairies manifested by Kong Ying descended from the sky along with musical notes that surrounded Lin Yun.

Seeing that Lin Yun was surrounded and would suffer a heavy blow soon, something unexpected occurred. Lin Yun waved his hand, and he retrieved an indigo flute, unleashing a powerful musical note explosion with hundreds of changes. When the musical tone reached its peak, a crimson sun rose behind Lin Yun.

The crimson sun manifested by Saint Tone instantly destroyed the phenomenon of fairies. When the soundwave spread out, countless tables and jade utensils shattered. Some couldn’t bear the soundwave and were sent flying away.

Kong Ying was surprised, and the strings on the zither in his hand snapped. This made him throw out a mouthful of blood, his face pale. Xiahou Feng and Xin Wuhen were also caught in the storm of musical notes when they got up and fell beside Kong Ying.

Lowering his flute, Lin Yun’s forehead was covered in beads of sweat, and his face became pale. The fight wasn’t as easy as it looked. He had to face three Grand Musicians, and the last outburst exhausted a tremendous amount of his mental energy. He placed his life on the line in that attack because if he couldn’t defeat Kong Ying, he would be defeated instead.

But the three gave him an opportunity. If they only competed in music dao, it would be tough for him, even if he managed to win. But the trio resorted to schemes and courted death because there was no way Kong Ying could withstand Lin Yun’s outburst by himself.

“Who still wants to challenge me? Martial dao or music dao, anyone amongst the same generation can freely challenge me!” When Lin Yun landed on the ground, he stowed the Divine Indigo Jade Bamboo Flute and retrieved the Thunderstorm Zither.

His voice wasn’t loud, but everyone could feel a burning slap on their faces. Regarding martial dao, Huang Xuanyi was defeated, and his eyes were crippled again. As for musical dao, the three Grand Musicians lost. There might be many people at the banquet, but who would dare to say they were stronger than those four?

With that, the entire West Garden Banquet fell into a strange silence, and no one dared to look at Lin Yun straight in the eyes. Those who insulted Lin Yun earlier could feel a burning sensation on their faces.

Seated on the main table, the Wind Edge Lord’s face was horrifyingly dark because what happened today was the greatest humiliation he had ever suffered.

As the corner of his lips rose, Lin Yun looked at the Wind Edge Lord, “I was forced to make a move, and I apologize for disrupting your banquet. But this isn’t exactly bad because it looks like you guys don’t have to make a trip to the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion tomorrow. I’ll be taking my leave, then!”

The Wind Edge Lord slammed his wine cup on the table, jolting everyone’s hearts. This made everyone wonder if Liu Chenfeng would personally make a move. That didn’t seem impossible because the Wind Edge Lord was only in his mid-thirties, even if his cultivation reached the ninth-pulse Dragon Pulse Realm. He might be slightly older than Lin Yun, but they could be considered to be in the same generation.

“You think you can come and go as you wish? Where do you think you are?” The Wind Edge Lord looked at Lin Yun with his face ugly. No emotions could be heard in his tone, but his voice was frighteningly prestigious.

“Wind Edge Lord, you want to fight me?” Lin Yun’s eyes lit up. He continued, “Come on, then. I already said that anyone in the same generation can freely challenge me.”

“Hahaha.” The Wind Edge Lord smiled. “I’m already halfway into the Samsara Edict Realm, and there are no benefits to me, even if I defeat you. On the other hand, you can boast for your entire life if you can withstand ten moves from me.”

Everyone in the banquet secretly nodded, and the meaning behind the Wind Edge Lord’s words was evident; Lin Yun wasn’t worthy to fight him.

Squinting his eyes, Lin Yun smiled, “You won’t know if you don’t try. Perhaps I can defeat you by luck?”

“No need to try and provoke me because I won’t make a move against you. Talk about it again when you reach the top hundredths on the Dragon Pulse Ranking. Otherwise, you’re not even qualified for me to bat an eye at you.” The Wind Edge Lord said indifferently. As he spoke, he suddenly stood up and unleashed a terrifying aura that made everyone feel suffocating under the tremendous pressure.

“It’s natural for young people to be impulsive, and I can’t be bothered by it. I don’t care if that foolish brother of mine suffered in your hands, but I won’t be able to give the Ming Cult an explanation if I let you go just like that when you blinded Huang Xuanyi.” The Wind Edge Lord said. “I’ll have to trouble you to stay in my Liu Saint Clan for a few days to discuss this matter after the Ming Cult and Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion’s representatives are here.”

“What if I insist on leaving, then?” Lin Yun smiled.

“Leave?” The Wind Edge Lord snickered. “You can give it a try!”

Several waves of pure saint aura swept out when he said those words, and they all locked onto Lin Yun.

“Do you think that I’m here by myself?” Lin Yun said indifferently.

“I’m not Uncle Jiang. Since I want you to stay, you can only stay, and no one can save you!” The Wind Edge Lord smiled.

“Haha! No one can save him? Wind Edge Lord, why don’t you try and touch my Big Brother Lin!” When Wind Edge Lord was speaking, a red figure appeared from the east. Behind that red figure was a white figure enveloped in saint radiance, and her expression was as indifferent as an iceberg and noble like a saint.

“Saint Elder!” Jiang Yu’s face changed when he saw the white figure.
