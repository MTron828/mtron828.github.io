Chapter 1047 - Bloodbath!

Lin Yun turned around and gave everyone a glance before he left. He knew that a few more people would try to stop him, but the death of Zhao Feng should make them think twice before blocking him.

If possible, he wanted to avoid getting jumped. But if anyone tested him, he wouldn’t hesitate to be ruthless. In Four Phase City, many people took one last glance at Lin Yun. After all, this might be the last time they ever saw him.

Lin Yun’s journey to Wind Mound City wasn’t peaceful. Along the way, he was assaulted five times. Each one of his attackers had powerful treasures that were either given by the Realm Sons or obtained from ruins. Regardless of the treasures that his attackers had, they were immediately cut down. It was an annoying journey, but also a bloody one.

Three days later, Lin Yun appeared in Wind Mound City. It was an ancient city occupied by the Nether Divinity Realm Son. The city was covered in a terrifying aura and various phenomena. Everyone who was in the city was shocked that Lin Yun actually appeared.

“Lin Yun, you really have some guts,” said a general from one of the war realms. Although Lin Yun slaughtered the generals, the war realms had no shortage of geniuses. The Realm Sons were able to replenish their forces quickly by granting the newcomers cultivating techniques and treasures. This also meant that the newcomers had reached the level of their predecessors.

Additionally, there were many forces that the Realm Sons had hidden. It was clearly a massive formation.

“What a terrifying aura. Exactly how many geniuses did the Realm Sons rope in?”

“Well who wouldn’t be tempted by the promise of a saint clan? I bet even those on the gold rankings are here. They probably don’t have any enmity with Lin Yun, but they can’t afford to lose out on such a crazy reward.”

“Lin Yun has to be careful!” There were many people in the city who wanted to see how things would unfold. But when Lin Yun arrived, he ignored everyone waiting for him on the city walls.

“You bastard, stop right there. The Realm Sons are holding the Demon Slaughtering Assembly and no one is allowed to get close without my order!” A general roared from the city wall as the war realm forces prepared to fight Lin Yun. With the accumulation of their killing aura, they caused heaven and earth to tremble.

There was no doubt that a formation of this level had never been seen in the Heavenly Path. Aside from the war realms, no one could rally this many people. It was so strong that a Realm Son by themselves would be fated to die. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Who would have thought that Lin Yun would have the courage to enter the city? Suddenly, a powerful sword aura streaked through the horizon and smashed the gate into pieces. Lin Yun ignored the generals and pressed on.

“You’re courting death!” The face of the gray-clothed general changed, but he simply retreated to the depths of the city. It was a puzzling scene for everyone watching.

“A turtle trapped in a jar…” It seemed like there were instructions given to the generals by the Realm Sons.

Wind Mound City was a majestic city. It seemed like the Nether Divinity Realm Son had turned Wind Mound City into his palace. When Lin Yun stepped onto the streets, he sensed three powerful auras. Even from afar, he could sense that the auras belonged to the Realm Sons.

Lin Yun’s face was dark as he picked a direction. He didn’t bother concealing himself even though he felt the killing aura of countless people locked onto him. He was under great pressure every time he walked forward.

All of the new geniuses on the gold ranking were controlling a spiritual array that made things difficult for Lin Yun. Clearly, there were several spiritualists trying to seal Lin Yun’s path.

Lin Yun didn’t need to turn around to realize that his path was being blocked. Since he was here, he was naturally prepared to lose his life. At the very least, he would dye Wind Mound City in blood if he couldn’t save Yue Weiwei.

“Lin Yun, this is as far as you go!” The gray-clothed general who stopped Lin Yun earlier had reappeared. The general had appeared with many others who were wielding secret treasures. Additionally, Lin Yun could also sense many terrifying auras hidden in the buildings by his side.

“Get lost!” Lin Yun barked without any change to his expression.

“This is Wind Mound City. Lin Yun, you better show some respect!” The gray-clothed general squinted his eyes as killing aura brewed in his pupils. The air in front of the general began to distort as he spoke, “Do you want to see Yue Weiwei? Well, we won’t let you. The Realm Son told us how you treated He Qianfan. You might as well get on your knees right now or else we’ll kill you!”

Lin Yun raised his head to look at the group of people in front of him and said, “One month ago, twelve generals died by my sword in the Yellow Sandy Plain. It would be best for you to get lost. Otherwise, don’t blame me for being ruthless!”

“Flower Burial, how impressive. Remember, this is Wind Mound City, the camp of Nether Divinity Realm Son. No one here is afraid of you,” said the gray-clothed general coldly.

Lin Yun merely swept his glance at the party before him and continued, “You guys don’t belong to the war realms. If you leave right now, I can overlook your actions.”

“Hahaha!” Everyone facing Lin Yun laughed at his suggestion.

“Lin Yun, you have some fame in the Heavenly Path, but who are you compared to the Realm Sons? You’re not even fit to clean the feet of the Realm Sons.”

“You still dare to threaten me even when facing death? Lin Yun, don’t think too highly of myself. Let’s forget about the Realm Sons and the Kunlun Realm for right now. There are many gold rank geniuses here that you can’t compare to! Lin Yun, we won’t let you enter unless you crawl the rest of the way. If you don’t listen to us, the Nether Divinity Realm Son will strip your little lover! I heard that she's a great beauty!”

“Are you furious? So what? There’s nothing you can do!” The group began to laugh fearlessly as they mocked Lin Yun. They were followers of the Realm Sons, so they had nothing to fear.

The gray-clothed general continued the ridicule, “Lin Yun, you’ve offended the Realm Sons, why would they be polite with you? You were destined to die the moment you offended the three war realms!”

Lin Yun maintained his composure as he looked at the gray-clothed general. Then, he tapped his finger on the barrier, “Since you guys aren’t willing to retreat, you can just die!”

Just like that, the barrier broke into pieces. The gray-clothed general’s face changed, but he didn’t panic. He simply pulled out a golden disk and threw it towards Lin Yun.

“Golden Lotus Disk!” The spectators were shocked. Although the disk was a replica, it still had an extraordinary origin. At the same time, the geniuses on the gray-clothed general’s side also took out their treasures that were gifted by the Realm Sons. The fluctuation from the treasures was extremely terrifying. Clearly, they had the strength to act courageously in front of Lin Yun.

“Lil’ Red!” Lin Yun roared. Lil’ Red, who was on Lin Yun’s shoulder, spat out torrential flames from the Fire Spiritual Pearl that it previously swallowed. In the next second, a sea of flames enveloped everyone.

Then, Lin Yun walked over and began to emit a dazzling sword ray. He was wielding his sky sword intent at greater mastery that only empyreans could wield.

When Lin Yun pushed his sky sword intent to the limit, the gray-clothed general became fearful. At this moment, the Golden Disk Lotus was being suppressed by the Fire Spiritual Pearl. “No, don’t come closer!”

Lin Yun ignored the cries and reached out with his left hand. His hand landed on the chest of the gray-clothed general as he destroyed the general’s attack. This guy wanted to make me crawl?

Then, Lin Yun’s sword ray sliced the general’s head off. Fresh blood spilled everywhere as Lin Yun’s sword intent dominated his foes.

Relying on his sky sword intent alone, Lin Yun sliced through all of the attacks that were directed at him. Countless corpses littered the ground as heads rolled everywhere.

Lin Yun had already given them a chance to live, but they insisted on pushing it. So they couldn’t blame him for starting a massacre. Sword rays bloomed brightly as everyone failed to resist the attacks.

“Flower Burial, forgive me! The Realm Sons forced me to do this!” Some people fell to their knees to beg for their lives, but it was already too late. Lin Yun would slaughter everyone who mocked him and dared to speak about Yue Weiwei.

Just like that, Lin Yun walked past a pile of corpses on the ground.
