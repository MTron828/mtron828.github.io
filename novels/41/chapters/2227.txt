Chapter 2228 - Where's the Deity's Corpse?

A group of people came, and Lin Yun raised his head with his bamboo hat on. The ones that came were from the holy lands of the Eastern Desolation. They came together and probably wanted to form an alliance. After all, many of the people here were from outside the Eastern Desolation.

`The few leading the parties weren’t old but were all at the Saint Realm. When Lin Yun raised his head with his bamboo hat on, he saw that Ji Zixi was also amongst the crowd. She was shining brightly as she gave off a sacred aura. The youths from the other holy lands surrounded her, trying to get on her good side.

The Flame Dragon River was dangerous, and those flying above it must bear great pressure. If they fell into the river, they would lose their lives. The magma contained terrifying dragon flames, tainted with a divinity that even a saint couldn’t withstand.

Many people gathered here but couldn’t find a way to cross the river. But the holy lands came prepared and got a few elders to probe the river.

“Young Master, there is a skeleton frame of a complete Flame Dragon at the bottom, giving off a powerful pressure. If we want to cross it, we must resist the dragon aura. If we fall into the river, even a Saint will have an issue surviving.” A golden-robed elder respectfully spoke to a young man.

This young man gave off an extraordinary temperament, and was the young master of the Ming Cult, Huang Jingyu.

He might seem young, but was over a hundred years old and a second-stage Saint Lord. Even in this era, someone who could become a Saint around a hundred years old could be considered a genius.

The purple-clothed youth standing beside him was the Myriad Lightning Sect’s Heavenly Kui Saint Lord. He was the youngest Saint Lord in the past few centuries of the Myriad Lightning Sect, becoming a Saint Lord before he was a hundred years old.

On the right of Huang Jingyu was a young bladesman. This person was Liu Yunlan of the Heavenly Flame Sect, known as the Billow Cloud Saint Lord, with a high attainment in the blade.

The three were geniuses and handsome, especially Huang Jingyu, the most outstanding in status and talent. Compared to them, the black-clothed youth from the Divine Dao Pavilion looked rather low-profile. This person was someone whom Lin Yun had met before, Qu Wushuang. He was the Young Master Wushuang who had provoked and fought him back in the Heavenly Dao Sect.

He came from a musical clan and behaved in a high profile manner back then, calling himself Young Master Wushuang, and was famous in the Eastern Desolation. But after his trip to the Heavenly Dao Sect, he changed and became low-profile. Lin Yun didn’t know what opportunity he encountered that allowed him to become a Saint.

“Wushuang, it shouldn’t be hard for you to cross the river, right? After all, you even endured the Heavenly Flames of the Divine Dao Pavilion,” Huang Jingyu smiled.

“No one has made it through the last stage of the Divine Dao Pavilion’s Heavenly Channel Pagoda, and this is because the Heavenly Flames are tough to deal with,” Liu Yunlan of the Heavenly Flame Sect said.

The Myriad Lightning Sect’s Heavenly Kui Saint Lord also said, “Young Master Wushuang doesn’t have to be courteous. After all, this is a great opportunity to show off before the little princess.”

Ji Zixi’s eyes flashed with unhappiness because she hated people calling her ‘little princess’ the most; especially since she was never a princess.

Qu Wushuang humbly smiled, “Looking at how confident the three of you are, I’m afraid you guys already have a method to cross the river. So I do not need to embarrass myself with my pitiful tricks.”

Huang Jingyu’s group of three merely smiled and said nothing. The three of them might be young, but they had become Saint Lords at a young age. But they weren’t young enough to be compared to Qu Wushuang, so they wanted to probe the latter’s strength and make him suffer a little. However, they didn’t continue on, seeing that Qu Wushuang was tactful.

Billow Cloud Saint Lord said, “If we want to cross the river, we can’t bear the dragon aura head-on because the pressure will increase.”

“The Saint Lords tried to bear the dragon aura and died terrible deaths.”

“So we have to go there obediently, swim over, use a boat or a secret treasure if we want to get over smoothly.” As expected, these people already had a way to deal with it.

“I’ll go first.” Huang Jingyu smiled as he soared to the sky, jumping towards the Flame Dragon River that had devoured several Saint Lords. This caused an uproar in the surroundings, but before the exclamations could subside, Huang Jingyu stood firmly on the surface of the magma river.

Everyone discovered a sun and a moon beneath Huang Jingyu’s feet that looked like a Yin-Yang diagram, carrying him to the other side of the river. Shortly after, those from the Ming Cult followed closely behind with a Yin-Yang diagrams beneath their feet. They were like lamps as they crossed the river without any trouble.

“As expected of the Ming Cult!”

“Ming Cult should be the strongest in the Eastern Desolation, and the Heavenly Dao Sect is a joke.”

“The Heavenly Dao Sect only has a fake reputation, and the Ming Cult is stronger in regards to its foundation.” Many people were chatting amongst themselves at the shore of the river. The Ming Cult stood out recently, with many people wanting to get on their boat. As a result, this became why so many people were praising the Ming Cult.

Those from the Heavenly Flame Sect began to cross the river as well. Their method was simple. They used their blades as a boat, standing on the blades as they broke through the magma waves.

The Myriad Lightning Sect wasn’t inferior in comparison. They took out a secret treasure. This was a silver boat enveloped in lightning that enveloped all of their members as they headed to the other side of the river.

Seeing this, everyone finally found a solution and imitated them. Instead of bearing the dragon aura, they controlled various treasures to cross the river. This method was safe, but some were unlucky and couldn’t bear the high temperature of the river, falling into the river with a scream.

“Lady Zixi, do you want to cross the river with me?” Qu Wushuang looked at Ji Zixi with his eyes shining brightly. After he suffered a setback in his pursuit of Bai Shuying, he became a lot more low-profile and depressed for a long time. That was until he met Ji Zixi, the little princess of the Divine Phoenix Mountain. When he saw her, he fell in love with her at first sight. He could only apologize to Bai Shuying because he realized Ji Zixi was his true love. At the very least, there wouldn’t be Flower Burial this time, right?

Qu Wushuang wore a smile, looking suave with his eyes full of expectation.

“I appreciate Young Master Wushuang’s kindness, but the Divine Phoenix Mountain has a way to cross the river.” Ji Zixi didn’t reply, but the white-clothed elder beside her rejected on her behalf.

Ji Zixi looked at Qu Wushuang, and said, “Why would the phoenix be afraid of the dragon?”

Everyone from the Divine Phoenix Mountain soared to the sky and released dazzling flames. As a phoenix cry resounded between heaven and earth, those from the Divine Phoenix Mountain were like phoenixes as they flew across the Flame Dragon River, and the phoenix aura that they released smashed the dragon aura apart, smoothly crossing the river.

“How overbearing!” Lil’ Purple’s voice resounded from the Iris Secret Realm. “This is how descendants of the Divine Phoenix Clan should look like, and I’m starting to take a fancy on that girl.”

Lin Yun ignored Lil’ Purple, wanting to see how Qu Wushuang would cross the river. He was curious about what Qu Wushuang encountered that allowed him to reach the Saint Realm. It looks like time has changed.

Qu Wushuang wasn’t depressed, but became even more infatuated with Ji Zixi instead. He quickly pulled his gaze away after he couldn’t see Ji Zixi’s figure anymore. This was the kind of woman that he wanted to marry!

“Young Master, it’s time for us to cross the river,” the Divine Dao Pavilion said.

“Let’s go,” Qu Wushuang smiled. He had long thought of a way to cross the Flame Dragon River, but was hiding his strength in his reply to Huang Jingyu. Keeping a low profile was the best way, and he had to thank Flower Burial for those teachings. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to have his current accomplishment.

Qu Wushuang left everyone to the shore as a group of Saint Lords from the Divine Dao Pavilion took a brush and began painting. They used ink refined from the blood of various saint beasts, and the brushes were all Glory Saint Artifacts. They drew various saint runes for a few minutes, each with ten-odd layers of saint runes around them.

“What should we do now?” A Saint Lord asked.

“Swim over,” Qu Wushuang smiled.

Those from the Divine Dao Pavilion jumped into the river, using the most primal way to cross the river. But this shocked everyone, and they had to give it to the Divine Dao Pavilion. It was a pity that none of them could learn this technique.

“The Divine Phoenix Mountain is lucky that they didn’t agree to it. Otherwise, that little princess would have to swim across the river like Qu Wushuang.”

“That’s because she’s smart.” A few cultivators beside Lin Yun smiled as they used various means to cross the river.

“Holy shit, that was a surprise,” Lin Yun smiled.

“How are you going to get there?” Lil’ Purple asked.

“Jump over.” Lin Yun chuckled as he found a place without many people and took a deep breath before he jumped into the sky. He easily smashed apart the dragon's aura and crossed the river. After a few leaping taps on the river’s surface, Lin Yun reached the other side. “The phoenix isn’t afraid of dragon aura, so why should I be afraid when I have the Azure Dragon Divine Physique?”

“Holy shit, he has successfully shown off.” Lil’ Purple muttered from the Iris Secret Realm.

“Something isn’t right,” Lin Yun muttered as he landed on the ground. He might not have grasped Space Dao, but his movement technique could come in contact with space, and when he looked back, he could see that the space here appeared to have overlapped.

The sky of the Flame Dragon River was filled with fog, which looked bizarre. But it was dangerous to be in the Heavenly Void, so Lin Yun only take note of it with no intentions of retreating.

Lin Yun pulled his gaze away and saw various Blood Crows in front of him again. Some Blood Crows had taken on a humanoid form, giving off a powerful pressure with high intelligence. The Heavenly Void was massive, and space appeared to have been distorted by some sort of power, making this place weird and dangerous.

Half an incense stick later, Lin Yun and Lil’ Purple captured a humanoid Blood Crow. Lin Yun asked, “Is there a deity’s corpse in the Heavenly Void?”

This Blood Crow was a youth, and he had a weird smile, “Ha, that’s for sure. Otherwise, where do Blood Crows come from?”

“Where’s the deity’s corpse?” Lil’ Purple wore a ferocious expression and asked, “If you’re not going to say, I don’t mind turning you into a barbequed crow!”

Blood Crow smiled in disdain, “Here in the Heavenly Void. We won’t die, so you can’t threaten us. I don’t know if you dare to eat Blood Crows, but I have eaten many humans. I have eaten lots of little girls like you.”

He was unconvinced because even though he was a first-stage Saint Lord, a little girl and a Quasi-Saint defeated him.

“How dare you look down on me!” Lil’ Purple became furious as the divine runes bloomed on her forehead, restricting the Blood Crow. She had two divine runes on her forehead, the Azure Dragon Divine Rune and Ice Phoenix Divine Rune, that gave off a powerful pressure. This made the Blood Crow scream out in pain, but he still wasn’t willing to say where the deity’s corpse was.

“Lin Yun, this fellow is too hateful. Let’s just cook and eat it,” Lil’ Purple said furiously.𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Well, it’s pretty good if we can refine him into a bead,” Lin Yun replied.

The Blood Crow youth’s face changed when Lin Yun mentioned ‘bead,’ but he still tried his best to maintain his composure. He feigned ignorance and asked, “What bead are you talking about?”

Seeing this, Lin Yun instantly knew that the Blood Crows in the Heavenly Void weren’t the same as those from the Myriad Grave Valley. The Heavenly Void’s Blood Crows seemed to be able to revive, so they weren’t afraid of death.

“This.” Lin Yun took out a bead he hadn’t refined and gave it to the Blood Crow youth. This was the bead that was left behind by The Blood Crow Ancestor at the Myriad Grave Valley.

But the Blood Crows here didn’t seem to leave a bead behind, and they would reincarnate differently. Lin Yun bluffed the Blood Crow youth that he had refined this bead.

When the Blood Crow youth saw this bead, he began to tremble in fear as he looked at Lin Yun in horror, “H-How can you possibly accomplish that? This is heretical! Y-You look like you’re from a righteous sect, at first glance.”

“You’re wrong about that. He’s the scum of the righteous path, known as the Holy Maiden Killer. This is why people call him Flower Burial, and he has done all kinds of evil in the world, the biggest scumbag in the world,” Lil’ Purple smiled.

The Blood Crow youth’s face changed with fright. When he heard that Lin Yun was Flower Burial, his voice trembled, “Y-You’re Flower Burial?”

Lil’ Purple smiled, “See? I didn’t bluff you, right? So tell us, where’s the deity’s corpse? Then again, it’s fine if you don’t want to point out the direction for us.”

“Speak.” Lin Yun said indifferently as he crushed the bead in his hand.

The Blood Crow youth finally felt despair and maniacally laughed, “You guys ask where the deity’s corpse is located? Aren’t you guys in the deity’s corpse?”
