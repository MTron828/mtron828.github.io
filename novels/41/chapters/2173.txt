Chapter 2174: Great Profound Sword Canon

Seeing Ye Guhan’s solemn expression, Lin Yun didn’t dare to be negligent and immediately made the Heavenly Dao Oath that he wouldn’t teach anyone the Great Profound Sword Canon.

“This is the book recording the Great Profound Sword Canon. Keep it safe and look at it first. The main portion is complete, but those related with movement techniques, secret techniques, and sword techniques are in the Sword Sect,” Ye Guhan said as he handed a golden jade slip to Lin Yun.

The golden jade slip was heavy and didn’t look like a jade or bamboo slip. Instead, it looked like it was made of metallic wood. When Lin Yun placed it against his forehead, he could feel boundless information pouring into his mind, along with various ancient scriptures, mantras, and obscure diagrams that gave him a headache.

Roughly fifteen minutes later, Lin Yun finally sorted out his thoughts and had an idea what kind of martial technique the Great Profound Sword Canon was. The complete Great Profound Sword Canon contained many compatible martial techniques. The golden jade slip contained the main part of the Great Profound Sword Canon, so it was more appropriate to call it the Great Profound Sword Sutra. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

In a nutshell, the Great Profound Sword Canon had nine stages. But because the two peaks were destroyed, one could only reach the seventh stage at best, and one could choose to manifest a sword with each stage. This was corresponding with the seven peaks of the Sword Sect, the Divine Firmament, Scarlet Firmament, Indigo Firmament, Azure Firmament, Emerald Firmament, Profound Firmament, and the Golden Firmament.

If Lin Yun wanted to reach the first stage, he would naturally choose to manifest the Divine Firmament Sword and other disciples would manifest a sword corresponding to their peaks. Each sword was profound, such as the Divine Firmament Sword containing nether energy that could corrode all life, the Scarlet Firmament Sword contained the sun’s fire that could incinerate everything in the world, the Indigo Firmament Sword contained lightning, and so on. Each sword had its own profundity.

After reaching the third stage, one would be able to set up the Great Profound Sword Array, overlapping the different attributes together to unleash more power. Aside from that, would be what his senior brother said about multiplying sword intent, and each stage could multiply the sword intent by onefold. But he had to form the Great Profound Sword Seal beforehand, and the seal would exhaust his vitality and saint aura. Then again, the Great Profound Sword Seal was comparable to an ultimate attack, so the user would naturally have to pay the price when using it.

“How profound…” Lin Yun wore a grave expression as he lowered the jade slip in his hand. The Great Profound Sword Canon gave him a feeling that it didn’t have an end, and the limit was terrifyingly high.

“There are legends that the Great Profound Sword Canon originates from the Great Profound Scripture, an ancient scripture that has existed since the birth of the era,” Ye Guhan said.

“That’s too far away. The Great Profound Sword Canon is enough for me to cultivate for a long time,” Lin Yun said honestly. This was the first time he felt that his comprehension wasn’t as good as he had imagined.

Ye Guhan began to explain the Great Profound Sword Canon to him, and he would even teach him by hand. Since Ye Guhan wasn’t on the same level as the Radiant Sword Saint, he naturally couldn’t just show Lin Yun the profundity with just a few words. So Ye Guhan could only teach him slowly.

But it was lucky that Lin Yun was smart, and he practically understood with one explanation. The entire process lasted three months, and Lin Yun had consolidated his cultivation to the lesser phase of the Indigo Origin Phase, and his azure saint aura turned into indigo saint aura. At the same time, Lin Yun sorted out his thoughts, and the obscure parts of the Great Profound Sword Canon also became clear in his mind.

“Alright, I’ll stop here. You have six months left on the Dao Comprehending Stage,” Ye Guhan smiled. “I won't disrupt you, but I will come back in six months to check on your progress.”

This time, Ye Guhan didn’t only leave the Dao Comprehending Stage but the entire secret realm. With that, Lin Yun was the only one left in this secret realm.

“I can’t let my Senior Brother down since he spent so much time on me, and I have to try to reach the fourth stage of the Great Profound Sword Canon…” Lin Yun muttered. After all, Ye Guhan taught him for three months, and it would be disappointing if he couldn’t reach the fourth stage.

The Great Profound Sword Canon was tough to cultivate, but Lin Yun had his own advantage. He had been practicing the Dragon-Phoenix World Annihilating Sword Canon, and this sword canon was on the same level as the Great Profound Sword Canon. Secondly, Lin Yun was confident in his talent in sword dao, and his cultivation definitely wouldn’t be slow when cultivating a sword-related cultivation technique.

Lastly, the Dao Comprehending Stage could save him a lot of resources. Cultivation techniques were different from martial techniques because cultivation techniques required resources, but he didn’t have to worry about that on the Dao Comprehending Stage. He placed the Bodhi Seed in his mouth and began cultivating the Great Profound Sword Canon.

Six months later, when Ye Guhan came, he saw Lin Yun sitting on the Dao Comprehending Stage with his eyes closed. When Lin Yun heard Ye Guhan’s footsteps, he opened his eyes. Looking at Ye Guhan, he asked in a surprised tone, “It has already been six months? Isn’t this a little too fast?”

Lin Yun forgot the flow of time while being focused on cultivating. He never expected time to pass so quickly.

Ye Guhan smiled, “Not bad.”

As a Sword Saint, he could roughly gauge Lin Yun’s current level. After six months, Lin Yun made rapid progress, and his progress in the Great Profound Sword Canon must be fast as well.

Lin Yun shook his head, and said, “It's not that smooth.”

“Oh?” Ye Guhan asked, “Are you serious about that?”

“Is my time up?” Lin Yun asked, not wanting to think about it any further.

“Yeah. The Dao Comprehending Stage will exhaust a lot of resources, and we can’t let you be on it without a time limit. Furthermore, staying here for too long will drift you away from the outside world, and you will need a long time to adapt to the flow of time in the outside world,” Ye Guhan said. Even if a time-space treasure was powerful, it was an external object, and it wasn’t good to be too reliant on it.

“I understand,” Lin Yun forced a smile. Although he could connect with the outside world through the Heavenly Wheel Pagoda, it wasn’t direct. So if he spent too long in here, the situation his senior brother said might occur, and he might even incur the wrath of Heavenly Dao.

“No need to hurry. The Great Profound Sword Canon is hard to comprehend, and it might be conflicted with the sword sutra you have practiced before. I’ll help you look into it in the future,” Ye Guhan said as he patted Lin Yun’s shoulder. A young man should be more confident in himself, and the situation might change after Lin Yun reaches the Heavenly Origin Phase. He could then try to cultivate the Great Profound Sword Canon again. Ye Guhan wondered if he taught it to Lin Yun too early.

Logically speaking, only Saints would start practicing the Great Profound Sword Canon within the Sword Sect, and he also started after reaching the Heavenly Origin Phase. With a smile, he asked, “Right, how far have you reached?”

He made up his mind to encourage Lin Yun no matter what he said, even if Lin Yun didn’t manage to manifest a sword. Speaking of which, Ye Guhan never saw Lin Yun so depressed before, so he had the responsibility to help Lin Yun rebuild his confidence. At the very least, he was pretty good at praising someone.

“It’s fine, you can tell me directly. You don’t need to have any qualms about it,” Ye Guhan encouraged with a smile.

Lin Yun briefly hesitated, before he said, “The pinnacle of the third stage. I haven’t reached the fourth stage yet.”

“Not bad…” Just when Ye Guhan was about to praise Lin Yun, he suddenly noticed that something wasn’t right somewhere. He asked, “Junior Brother, what did you say? How far have you reached in the Great Profound Sword Canon?”

Lin Yun heaved a sigh of relief when he heard Ye Guhan saying ‘not bad,’ but he became nervous when he saw Ye Guhan’s expression become serious. He nervously replied, “The pinnacle of the third stage. Is it that bad?”

Lin Yun wondered if he had let Ye Guhan down, but Ye Guhan was dumbfounded, and he lost his composure as a Sword Saint. He blurted out, “The pinnacle of the third stage? Holy shit… Are you serious?”

“Yeah. I initially wanted to reach the greater mastery of the fourth stage at the very least, but I’m stuck at the third stage. But I should be able to make a breakthrough soon,” Lin Yun said in pity. “Give me some time and I might be able to make a breakthrough.”

“You condensed the swords already?” Ye Guhan asked in disbelief.

“That’s for sure. I have already manifested three saint swords, the Divine Firmament Sword, Golden Firmament Sword, and Indigo Firmament Sword,” Lin Yun replied honestly. The three swords matched him perfectly. There was nothing to say about the Divine Firmament Sword, since he used the Divine Firmament Sword Sutra to build his foundation.

The Indigo Firmament Sword corresponded with his Thunder Dao, and he could unleash a greater power with the two combined. The Golden Firmament Sword increases his offensive ability, and it might have a surprise when facing saint artifacts or a body-refining cultivator.

“What about the Great Profound Sword Array?” Ye Guhan asked. After reaching the third stage of the Great Profound Sword Canon, one could use three swords to form the Great Profound Sword Array. But the sword array was another cultivation system. With the Great Profound Sword Array as the foundation, the Great Profound Sword Canon didn’t require any sword technique to unleash terrifying power.

“I grasped it.” Lin Yun’s eyes lit up when Ye Guhan mentioned the Great Profound Sword Array. He smiled, “The array is pretty smooth, and it’s smooth for me when practicing the type of moves that focuses on killing the enemies. With three swords overlapping together, the array can have thirty-six variations.”

.

Ye Guhan was dumbfounded. Was this what Lin Yun meant when he said that his progress wasn’t smooth? Even a Saint didn’t have Lin Yun’s cultivation speed! Within the entire Sword Sect, even those prodigy swordsmen in ancient times might not have Lin Yun’s progress.

Lin Yun needs comforting? I should be the one needing comfort instead! Ye Guhan complained in his heart.

“Senior Brother, why are you crying?” Lin Yun asked nervously. This was because Ye Guhan was wearing a bitter expression, and his face was even uglier than crying.

“Junior Brother, can you be more humane in the future?” Ye Guhan squeezed a smile.
