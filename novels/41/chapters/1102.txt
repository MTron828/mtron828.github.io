Chapter 1103 - Emerald Stars Beyond the Azure Sky

With the others tagging along, Lin Yun headed towards Sword Saint Mountain. The light from the mountain wasn’t actual light, but from an ancient sword intent that had been accumulated over the years. It was majestic and ancient. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Lin Yun’s face suddenly changed when he noticed the beam soar into the sky and towards the massive array protecting the sect. If the array was struck by the sword intent, at least half of the sect would be destroyed.

However, no one responded, which baffled Lin Yun. Out of nowhere, the sect master appeared above the beam and reached out towards the beam that was about to break apart the array.

The sect master emitted a terrifying sword aura as nine massive dragons enveloped the entire Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect. Along with a massive collision, the sword ray that soared towards the sky was blocked. Then, the sect master sat down and nine massive dragons blocked the sword aura emitted by the Sword Saint Mountain.

Lin Yun was deeply shocked by the domineering aura that the sect master emitted. Compared to the sect master, the dragons released by Jin Jue were nothing.

“This old geezer is interesting. He probably has a knot in his heart, which is why he’s stuck in the Dragon Pulse Realm. Based on his foundation alone, he can even make it as a heavenly king the moment he makes a breakthrough.” Lil’ Purple muttered in the sword box and continued, “No wonder he can suppress the sword aura from the Sword Saint Mountain!”

“Dragon Pulse?” Lin Yun was baffled. He only knew that the Empyrean Realm was above the Heavenly Soul Realm, and there was the Elysium Core Realm above it. But he knew nothing more than that. After all, he just arrived at Kunlun Realm.

With disdain on her face, Lil’ Purple said, “How ignorant. Let me brush you up on some knowledge. The Elysium Core Realm comes after the Empyrean Realm, where one is also known as a venerable. Above the Elysium Core Realm is the Dragon Pulse Realm, and each improvement will slowly make the body like a dragon. When all nine pulses are opened, one will have the qualification to become a saint in the future. This is also the reason why everyone says that the people in Kunlun Realm are dragons.”

“What about a king?”

“Kings are a completely different story. They’re practically invincible beneath the Saint Realm. However, they barely have the qualification to be my servant. After all, heavenly kings are very strong when they become a saint,” said Lil’ Purple.

Heavenly kings were invincible beneath the Saint Realm. So it seemed like the sect master had a storied past. But Lil’ Purple also didn’t explain what a heavenly king was and it appeared that they needed to talk more about cultivation in Kunlun Realm.

“Lin Yun!” The sect master’s voice sounded out from the horizon as everyone looked at Lin Yun. At this moment, Lin Yun felt as though everyone had disappeared in the world except for the sect master and him.

“You can ascend now.” Although this feeling had only lasted for a split second, it still sent chills down Lin Yun’s spine. He instantly knew that the sect master was probably even stronger than Senior Brother Feng Jue, or even Senior Luo Qingxu from the Sacred Alliance. Just like that, Lin Yun flew towards the Sword Saint Mountain.

“13 stages? Lin Yun really knows how to boast!”

“It’s been over a millennium since anyone managed to ascend the mountain. He’s still too inexperienced to do it. It’s impressive that he can master a sword technique with seven steps, but this is completely different.”

“He’ll probably suffer a failure. It’ll be interesting if he can’t even make it through the third stage.”

“It’s time for him to suffer a loss. After all, he humiliated us!” After Lin Yun left, all sorts of discussions sounded out in the place. However, it was a lot louder this time. It was clear that no one dared to speak in front of Lin Yun.

“Senior Sister, will Senior Brother Yun really be able to ascend the peak? Will you really agree to any request from him if he does?” Wang Yuruo smiled because it was a risky promise and Ye Ziling was famed for her beauty. The only reason why no one dared to approach her was because she was too cold.

Recalling Lin Yun’s gaze earlier, Ye Ziling said coldly, “He’s courting humiliation. Let’s not mention the 13th stage, it’ll be good if he can even make it through the third. And you, don’t get too close to him.”

“B-but senior brother was really handsome earlier! He mastered a sword technique in only seven steps. You didn’t see how ugly Senior Brother Feng’s face was earlier.” Wang Yuruo’s head was lowered in the beginning, but she raised her head as she spoke with her eyes shining brightly.

“Only little girls like you will be fooled by him.” Ye Ziling’s eyes flashed with disdain before she gave Wang Yuruo another warning.

“Senior Sister, look! That’s Senior Brother Yun’s cat!” Wang Yuruo’s eyes lit up. She pointed at Lil’ Red who was licking its paw and staring at Sword Saint Mountain. Not long later, Wang Yuruo returned with Lil’ Red in her embrace.

Lowering her head, Ye Ziling locked her brows together. She saw Lil’ Red moving around Wang Yuruo’s chest before closing its eyes in satisfaction. Wang Yuruo might be young, but she had a great figure.

Ye Ziling was instantly furious with how perverted Lin Yun’s cat was. But when she swept her glance out, she saw a white figure standing at the top of a pavilion looking in Lin Yun’s direction.

“She’s actually here!” Ye Ziling was surprised when she saw this white figure.

“Hehe. Senior Sister, this cat is really adorable!” Wang Yuruo didn’t listen and naively rubbed Lil’ Red’s head. However, Ye Ziling didn’t bother with her anymore. After all, she couldn’t possibly lower herself to a cat’s level. The only thing she could do now was to watch what Lin Yun would do.

There were many mountains in the Fleeting Cloud Sword Sect, and Lin Yun traveled through them with the Golden Crow Nine Transformations. When he got close to the Sword Saint mountain, an elder came up and said, “Follow me.”

Lin Yun responded by nodding his head. When he got to the foot of the mountain, he could see a colossal mountain that pierced through the sky. He instantly knew that it wouldn’t be easy for him to ascend the mountain, which made him feel a little bitter.

“The Sword Saint Mountain has a total of 13 stages, and you can receive a sword for each stage you get through,” explained the elder.

“Is there a sword sutra that comes along with it?” Lin Yun asked curiously. He desperately needed a holy spirit sword sutra right now. So it would be great if there was one that came with this sword technique.

“There isn’t.” The elder smiled and continued, “But who knows. There might be one if you can make it to the peak. After all, it’s been a millennium since anyone made it up there and no one truly knows what’s at the peak.”

“Senior, you must be joking.” Lin Yun smiled awkwardly.

“Hahaha!” The elder laughed as his impression of Lin Yun changed. After all, Lin Yun was arrogant back in the palace and disregarded everyone. But after coming in contact with Lin Yun, he realized that Lin Yun didn’t put on any airs.

“You’re a heavenly core disciple now. You can flip through the library to find a holy spirit sword sutra,” said the elder. With a sigh, he continued speaking, “You shouldn’t have made the bet with that lass. The 13 stages represent 13 swords. It will really end up being a waste if you can only make it through two of them.”

If he could only learn two swords of a holy spirit sword technique, then there was no point in taking the test.

“Up ahead is the Sword Saint Mountain. Remember to take it slow as you only have one chance.” The elder gave Lin Yun a few more pointers and even gave him a few secrets to the mountain.

Lin Yun nodded vigorously as he benefited greatly from the explanation. Then, he entered the Sword Saint Mountain. As he walked, he could sense the boundless sword intent in the environment that made him feel relaxed.

“What a great place!” Lin Yun let out a long breath because it was a treasured land for sword dao. Without any hesitation, Lin Yun decided to go into seclusion before proceeding to the first test. The test was on the wall up ahead and guarded by a stone statue. There were many runes engraved on the wall along with ancient words.

“Pick a word and defeat it to make it through the test,” said the statue when Lin Yun was examining the wall.

“That simple?” Lin Yun was baffled when he heard that.

“Simple? If you can find a word within an hour, then you’re a peerless genius in the sword dao,” said the stone statue with disdain.

Hearing that, Lin Yun smiled, “Then I might really be a peerless genius in the sword dao. Listen well. Emerald stars beyond the azure sky.”

When he was done, the stone statue wore a disbelief expression. However, Lin Yun didn’t stop there and continued, “The complete verse should go like this. Emerald stars beyond the azure sky, as flowers bloom and dance in the wind, they are accompanied by the stars in the sky. Fleeting clouds isn’t my intention, and ten thousand years have passed with a flick of my finger.”
