Chapter 716 - Strong Stance

Without knowing it, Lin Yun had already arrived at the eighth segment. This palace was tens of thousands of feet above ground and only the outline of blurred figures could be seen below. Looking up, the crimson sky was so close that it looked like it could be touched. At the same time, the pressure on the eighth segment was immense.

Even Lin Yun had to be careful as he could barely bring out 50% of his movement techniques here. The Azure Dragon Battle Physique was constantly making his blood boil as he was shrouded in a purple mist.

Everyone who could come here was the strongest batch in the secret realm and they were cautious of each other as they searched nervously.

“Damn it, why can’t we find it?”

“I clearly saw that there were two Demonification Fruits on this segment. Did someone take it ahead of us?”

“That’s impossible. Let’s not mention how hard it is to obtain a fruit on this segment, but the commotion here will definitely alert everyone.” Everyone discussed among themselves as they searched for the Demonification Fruits. But it definitely wasn’t easy to find a Demonification Fruit shrouded in eight wisps of aura.

The curved branches and leaves made this place even more complicated than a maze. There were those who saw the Demonification Fruits, but they couldn’t even run straight due to the maze.

“The Demonification Fruits!” Someone exclaimed, which instantly attracted everyone’s attention. Lin Yun also turned around to look at it.

He could see a purple-clothed elder shrouded in an ominous aura charging towards the fruits while bearing the immense pressure. Lin Yun narrowed his eyes as this old man wasn’t any weaker than Guo Xu. But unlike Guo Xu, he looked to be over a hundred years old and the aura coming from him also contained a wisp of death.

He came here to seek an opportunity to make a breakthrough to the Heavenly Soul Realm. Otherwise, his lifespan would run out in a few years. When someone like him put his life on the line, he could even give up his life. From a certain angle, he was even more terrifying than the geniuses here. When they looked at the direction the old man was running towards, they saw astral lights between the leaves and branches.

“That’s indeed the Demonification Fruit!” Lin Yun immediately confirmed the location. However, the old man missed his footing and fell down.

“No!” The old man roared out in rage. He tried his best to circulate his origin energy to soar back into the sky, but it felt as though there was an invisible palm descending upon him. It was futile no matter how he struggled.

“He’s dead,” muttered Lin Yun as he took a deep breath. This place was too brutal.

“Where is it?”

“Why is the Demonification Fruit gone?”

“Damn it, it was clearly here!” Clearly, no one had cared about the wandering cultivator’s life and death. They were more concerned with the Demonification Fruit. After all, it was a Demonification Fruit shrouded in eight wisps of aura and this section only had two of them. Anyone who could obtain it would definitely obtain a huge opportunity.

Everyone endured the pressure as they began to search for the Demonification Fruits. Meanwhile, Lin Yun fell into deep thoughts. Logically speaking, the Demonification Fruits should be somewhere hidden in the maze.

But just when he took a step out, a light lit up in his mind as he recalled the gaze of the old man when he fell down. His eyes were filled with regret and reluctance. This means that he must’ve found the real position of the Demonification Fruit.

With a gentle leap, Lin Yun reached where the old man fell as he started looking around. But he didn’t discover anything aside from the complicated maze. He couldn’t sense the Demonification Fruit’s fluctuation anywhere.

“Looks like I have to take the risk,” said Lin Yun as he looked at the abyss where the old man fell down. With a gentle leap, Lin Yun jumped down and he could sense an immense pressure crashing down on him.

“Over there!” Suddenly, Lin Yun noticed a fruit hanging in a corner. It was located in a secret spot, covered by dense branches and leaves.

“Azure Dragon Palm!” Lin Yun roared as his hand transformed into a sinister dragon claw. Just before he was about to be fully suppressed, he grabbed onto a branch and soared into the sky. He was a lot stronger than the old man, so he naturally got back up after jumping down.

He was already prepared to execute the Azure Dragon Palm the moment he fell down. But even so, he still sucked in a cold breath of relief.

“Time to go!” Lin Yun no longer hesitated and moved to the Demonification Fruit. It didn’t take long for him to arrive at the Demonification Fruit. Suddenly, the pressure weighing down on him increased and Lin Yun could sense his heart beating wildly as he got close to the fruit.

As his heart throbbed even more violently, Lin Yun’s face changed. He knew that he would die a terrible death if he insisted on proceeding. He had witnessed many people dying from the Demonification Fruit.

Right at this moment, a few people came over from other places. But they also stopped when they got close. Clearly, they were resisting the Demonification Fruit’s temptation.

Standing at the front was a youth, who Lin Yun recognized instantly. It was Gu Yang of the seven geniuses, who was accompanied by several elders. This person was one of the geniuses who wanted to kill him earlier.

“Lin Yun!” Gu Yang’s eyes flashed with killing aura when he looked at Lin Yun.

“I heard that you seized a Demonification Fruit with six strands of aura from Qin Xu and the Jin brothers?” Gu Yang said, wearing a playful smile.

“What has it got to do with you?” Lin Yun asked indifferently.

“Hand it over,” smiled Gu Yang. “And make sure you include the Divine Indigo Radiantstone. If you hand them to me, I can consider sparing your life.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Is that so? But it’s a pity that I don’t want to spare you!” Lin Yun soared into the sky with a dragon roar echoing from his body. When his sword aura combined with the Azure Dragon’s aura, it formed into the Azure Dragon Sword Aura that radiated with immense power.

“You’re courting death!” Gu Yang’s face changed. He never imagined that Lin Yun would actually attack.

But Lin Yun had faced the three of the seven geniuses head-on without falling into a disadvantageous position. So who was Gu Yang to act so arrogant before him?

As the two violent energies clashed, Gu Yang was sent flying back with cracks on the origin energy that protected him. He was the loser of the clash and he could feel an aching coming from his internal organs.

“You think I’m afraid of the seven geniuses in a one on one?” The sword intent in Lin Yun’s eyes radiated out, placing an immense pressure on Gu Yang. This brought fear to his pupils as Lin Yun’s sword intent was too powerful.

“You’re courting death!” Gu Yang roared as a terrifying aura radiated from within his body. His hair began to flutter and a sword with eight profound lights appeared above him. This sword was Gu Yang’s eighth profound grade martial soul.

The sword was cold like snow as it radiated a boundless killing aura. As the sword hovered above his head, Gu Yang’s aura underwent a transformation that could freeze the entire world. With every step he took, the cold aura coming from him grew denser. He only needed three steps to cover the entire region in frost.

“You can die without regrets now for forcing me to bring out my martial soul,” said Gu Yang with a sinister face. In his view, it was a great humiliation for him to be forced to summon out his martial soul when facing a sword slave in the Yang stage.

The freezing aura was something he comprehended after reaching the Yin-Yang stage. It could be considered his innate talent from awakening his martial soul. This made Lin Yun curious what innate talent he would awaken after reaching the Yin-Yang stage.

Right at this moment, a sword ray flashed out, causing a crack on the freezing aura coming from Gu Yang. Lin Yun had drawn the Flower Burial Sword.

“H-h-how is this possible?!” Gu Yang was startled as he couldn’t believe this scene.

“Nothing is impossible in this world.” Lin Yun stepped forward and his aura surged. His blood was already boiling when he got close to the Demonification Fruit, so now, the Azure Dragon’s aura was releasing a bewitching aura.

Like a bewitching lotus, Lin Yun released a stupefying dragon roar. Then, with another five steps, he started pouring his origin energy and Azure Dragon Sword Aura into the Flower Burial Sword.

Where do the flowers bloom!

A rose appeared as a boundless sword aura came crashing down on Gu Yang and all the Gu Clan elders.
